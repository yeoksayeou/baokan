<p>時評</p>
<h3>世事與人力</h3>
<p>世間萬事。皆由人力所造成。然旣造成之後。决非在一時之間。由人力所能轉變夫旣以人力造成之事。而不能人力轉變。原無此理。特以造成之也。非一朝一夕。故其轉變之也。亦非一朝一夕。轉變之人力。必須與造成時之人力相等。然後轉變之效乃見。苟在其力未至相等時。雖用人力。而效不即見。世人不察。一遇事之積久而致弊者。如經覺悟。即欲以若干人之力。暫時之間。轉變其事之弊。如或無。效遽謂其弊非人力所能剷除。豈非其始自視其人力太大。其後又自視其人力過薄耶。其實人力猶是人力。費若干人力而造成者。必費若干人力而轉變。其間無可徼倖亦毌用灰心也。</p>
<p>試舉一例。以證我之言。今日世界之金貴銀賤。日益加甚商業日衰失業日衆。而世界各國之謀挽銀價。圖振商業。救濟失業者。日有所聞。然而一無所效者。蓋因此銀賤。商衰失業。三者之由。來成於以前種種人力凑集之結果。决非今日區區補救之人力。所能成功而見效。苟自此以往。補救之力而日增。將來始有見效之一日也。</p>

<h3>日人在鐵嶺建築兵營</h3>
<p>瀋陽通信、日本駐軍在鐵嶺縣馬蓬溝建築兵營、於我國國防主權、極有關係、遼寗國民常識促進會日前曾派員往鐵嶺實地調查、茲已事畢回瀋、據其報告如下、</p>
<p>現在日軍建築之實况　在馬蓬溝北部之高地、距遼河水面約一里許、已有日軍在該地新建築之營房二十餘間、尙未完全竣工、將來確有大肆擴充之趨勢、四週豎有鐵絲網欄、範圍約數十畝、欄内東側、并建有守備兵士住所數間、門前豎有標椿、上書日本軍要塞司令部標界、</p>
<p>建築前之日人措詞　在未建築之前、日人聲稱爲存儲兵船之處所、查日人對我國之政策、向抱蠶食鯨呑主義、今日倉庫、明日即兵營、來日即砲台也、如南滿沿線之各個兵營設立、安奉線之各個砲台落成、無一不先由數間之倉庫而起、况馬蓬溝之建築、範圍較他處爲大、即以日人所稱存儲兵船之處所言、兵船係海軍之戰鬥品、亦爲侵略之表現、</p>
<p>建築後日人之横暴　去年七月間、日本海軍在馬蓬溝一帶演習時、其砲聲隆隆、兵船横駛、將我方民船衝沉及損傷者、不可枚舉、民衆含寃莫伸、祗有忍氣呑聲、然日軍毒猶未已、並欲在馬蓬溝之對面養馬堡·西木廠·紅崖·康家山一帶高地、作其陸戰隊之演習地、並擬以馬蓬溝之兵營完成後、即以對岸之十數村、作其永久試戰區、</p>
<p>馬蓬溝與鐵嶺全局之關係　鐵嶺縣城、已處在日軍包圍之下、城南一帶、如八里莊·柳河溝等村、均有日本兵營、佈置分爲南北兩大營、共有房舍四千餘間、約可駐兵五千人以上、城東一帶、如帽蜂山龍首山等處、均爲日軍隨意游行習演戰鬥之場所、附近居民受其蹂躪者、不可勝計、去年三月間、日人又欲集資建築龍首山馬路、以攫奪龍首山之實權、幸黄菊珊于文川胡靳凡鄧之傑等努力拒絕、始未得逞、刻下日人野心未已、仍欲在馬蓬溝兵營落成後、以强横手段、在龍首山之右方建築砲台、利用山峯、實行其居高臨下之設備、查此山與馬蓬溝遙遙相對、一旦有事、北則可保護其鐵橋、并可以控制柴河、西則可以掩護馬蓬溝之兵營、堵斷遼河之交通、南則可以保全其八里莊一帶之日軍房舍、城西一帶、有日人之南滿鐵路、道旁設有高壓電機、平時可以操縱我方之電業經濟權、戰時利用此機、可以裝設電網電雷、甚至發散毒瓦斯等、其危險不可言狀、總之鐵嶺縣城、已入於日軍之掌握、所有一線出路者、即馬蓬溝之一隅、老馬蓬溝位居遼河要衝、交通便利、一有事變、上可長趨遼源、下可直走營口、設此處再爲日軍所佔、則水道爲其壟斷、陸路爲其把持、扼我吭而拊我臂、遼瀋亦受其威脅矣、（十一日）</p>

<p>僕人丨我知道。我知道。一定不會打碎。（取了錢匆匆的去了。）主婦（半點鐘後見僕人捧了一隻鷄回來）丨這是甚麽意思。我呌你買鷄蛋。怎的買了一隻鷄回來。</p>
<p>僕人丨太太。今天街上滑得很倘買了鷄蛋我生怕跌交。打成粉碎。所以買一隻鷄較爲穏當。好在你要鷄蛋。讓它慢慢的生出來吧。</p>

<h3>吳稚暉飛贛顔也</h3>
<p>自上海號飛機失事後。以所傷爲熊楊兩要人。社會對於飛機。幾有談虎色變之概。實則均杞人之憂也。吳稚暉先生有鑑於此。特於應蔣主席之召赴贛。乘機飛往。以破杞人之憂。其於十二日登機之前夕。寄語其友人曰。上海號墜地。小小失事。豈足爲慮。以視前日英機之大慘劇。此實不足道也。吾决飛往江西。以爲之倡。此去二千里。半日可至。唐人詩謂千里江陵一日還者。與此相較。直小巫之見大巫也。其言豪壯。彼因噎廢食者。可無憂矣。不料十二日吳在滬八時登機後。飛行不久。即遇霧而下降。翌日各報載謂落於鎭江附近江中。由英輪挽之至鎭。乘客郵件皆登陸而去。機則待修理後返滬。聞者又爲吳氏憂。昨據江陰來客說。則此機實降落於江陰北門外之黄田港江面。以霧安然而下。毫無所傷。當時港口居民。聚觀者如堵。約歷半小時。仍振翼高飛西去。觀者鼓噪歡送。據此則吳氏此次飛贛。仍安然而去。關心吳氏者。固不必大驚小怪。而吳氏二千里壯遊。仍快於千里江陵一日還也。</p>
<h3>歡迎褚民誼先生回國誌盛湯筆花</h3>
<p>國民政府參加比國百年紀念博覽會總代表褚民誼氏偕秘書周世達君等於前日下午（十三）六時乘日本郵船春陽丸回國。情形已誌各報。是日見聞頗多。爰詳紀如后。</p>
<p>一月前湖州旅滬同鄉邵如馨君等接褚氏來電云。本月十三日回國。並悉此次赴比成績卓著。名列優勝。邵君等即開籌備歡迎會於大西洋西餐社。時予亦參與其間。衆推邵君爲籌備主任。十三日上午。</p>
<h3>糖果展覧會一瞥摩登老人</h3>
<p>星期日。赴寗波同鄉會。參觀冠生園之糖果展覽會。是日來賓極擁擠。陳列品可分爲兩大部。一表示製糖順序。二表演糖之用途。製糖順序。觀之令人　涎欲滴。而糖之用途。作小舞台八。佈景人物。俱甚逼眞。招財面孔之主人洗冠生。殷勤招待。在來賓中軋來軋去。大塊頭頗感不便。來賓題詞。尤多趣語。徐卓呆題頂瓜瓜三字。猶天祿之推潭僕遠。譯音也。據云。統計兩日之參觀人數。達三萬以上云。</p>
<p>予即往訪邵郡於二馬路平樂里籌備會中。各界前往加入歡迎者頗衆。午後一時。予首先偕吳天倪君等乘紮綵汽車前赴黄浦碼頭照料一切。及抵碼頭。但見牌樓燈綵、佈置井然。係明星影片公司置辦。上書「歡迎褚民誼先生回國」字様。旁綴一聯曰「博望聲名留絕域。神臯富庶震寰瀛」。富麗堂皇。盛極一時。另懸萬國旗幟。隨風招展。此外尙有綵色綢旗數十面。上繡「歡迎國府代表褚民誼先生回國」字様。尤覺悅目。因爲時尙早。加以浦江中寒風侵骨。苦無休息處。遂由吳君發起偕同往諸君假某茶肆啜茗。及三時許抵碼頭。歡迎者已陸續而來。約千餘人。鵠立碼頭。遥望來船。</p>
<p>邵如馨君奔走招呼。忙碌異常。並大分蛋糕。贈與來賓。口呼請大家當心來船。其時適有一黑色鉅輪鼓浪而來。邵即大呼來了······於是軍樂悠揚爆聲劈拍。且雜以鼓掌聲及該輪駛近。始知誤會。蓋係某公司輪自香港開來者。是亦歡迎聲中之趣聞也。</p>
<p>褚氏之尊人杏田先生年已八十鬚眉皆白。而精神嬰鑠。洵屬難得。四時許。亦蒞臨碼頭。由家人扶坐欄杆内。有人詢以如許年華。得毌辛左。答云。「我亦來看看熱鬧」並逢人便詢「船來了嗎」依欄盼望。睹此盛况。其中心正不知如何歡忻也。</p>
<p>明星影片公司因鑒於此次褚氏回國之盛况。特派董天涯程步高鄭小秋諸君携活動攝影機。帶同電燭。前往攝影。其時暮色沉沉。光線暗澹。予趨語董程二君曰。曷勿乘此空閑。爲褚老太爺攝一影片。以留紀念。二君極附吾議。遂由邵如馨君向褚老先生介紹當蒙首肯。於是小秋掌燭。步高指揮。褚老先生笑顔頓開。一幅佳影。遂攝入機中矣。</p>
<p>攝畢。羣呼來矣來矣。人頭擠擠。引領盼望。有持望遠鏡者。有持攝影機者。但見黑烟繚繞。一鉅輪漸駛漸近。於是軍樂齊奏。大放流星。五色繽紛。高昇鞭爆。聲震浦江。褚氏立輪上。手揮國旗。表示謝意。予遂向邵君發起高呼「歡迎褚民誼先生赴比勝利回國」「中華民國萬歲」「褚民誼先生萬歲」口號。由某君領導。一唱百和。脫帽揮巾。熱烈異常。褚氏之女公子。年甫七齡。亦在人聲鼎沸中。高呼伯伯。待輪近碼頭。即推代表十人。上輪歡迎。嗣因人多不易排衆而上。予隨吳天倪劉道芳諸君登輪。與褚氏握手。褚氏衣白灰色西裝。神彩奕奕。笑容可掬。下輪時。明星公司遂一一攝成影片。褚氏與其夫人</p>
<h3>南洋游記（一○三）靈花</h3>
<p>十四日由拿猫返缅京。（滿德里）晨七時上火車。此地挑夫。華人多吃大烟。或來遲則誤上車鐘點。或云彼竟與客棧勾通。故意誤客人上車。則可多挽留客人住宿一日也。與拿貓近處之車站。有有名之大瀑布。英名Manfalls可惜未得下車細看。蓋北缅沿途風景甚好。瀑布甚多。而以此爲最大也。我從瓦城（即缅京）北上。人咸告我雨季北上應注意生病。余心尙不謂然。至此果喉癢聲啞。至瓦城凡三日乃愈。蓋受風寒也。沿途經過許多小市鎭。每處皆有華人。蓋全缅境華人一二十萬。遍于各鄉。多娶缅女。僑生者多缅母所産。吾于此有一感想。中國以文化民族自命。而遇缅化則失敗。缅化兩特點。一爲佛化。一爲女化。凡中人娶缅女。一世以後。語言文化必缅化矣。但中人娶中女。亦必須一二千元以上之財産。而與缅人結婚自由。有過于中人者矣。</p>
<p>中國人之缺點。處處暴露自治力缺乏。操業亦有不正當者頗多。例如日本在天津所製之白丸。盛行于山西。内含嗎啡。以代鴉片。華北人因甚惡日本人。英國人售鴉片與我。我在敎科書及報紙上痛詆英人之野蠻。然而我在缅之僑民業白藥者。往往而有。白藥者一種麻醉劑。聞原製自澳洲。而華人販之。亦嗎啡之類。與缅人有害之物也。又自雲南南下入口之鴉片。其數不貲。途中有人示我某君今春仍是光蛋。數月來發財巨萬矣。乃販鴉片之故也。此等人社會亦鄙視之。但錢旣到手。自然有勢力。不畏人之鄙視也。</p>
<p>及家屬等。均攝入片中。藉留鴻雪。旋遂分乘汽車而散。時已鐘鳴七下矣。</p>
<h3>余天遂先生之弔奠鄭逸梅</h3>
<p>南社詞人余天遂先生之歸道山。倐已半載。一昨假派克路功德林領帖。予曾前往一謁弔之。瞻仰遺影。清癯而微髭。更令人回憶寓樓促膝。誨談殷殷之狀。如在目前。爲之愴然而涕。四壁挽聯。大都出南社同文之手。均哀婉雋永。耐人諷誦。如胡寄塵云。浮生若夢君先覺。世事如棋我獨觀。胡樸庵云。言論激昻。有畸行雄才問於世。詩文蒼莽。以報館學校終其身。葉楚傖云。於金石書畫外。兼擅歧黄。莫療貧病。在文字干戈中。偶共昕夕。遂了平生。柳亞子云。世變莽驚心。知君没而猶視。琴絃成絕響。嗟予生復奚堪。朱少屏云。白馬素車愁入夢。青天碧海悵招魂。餘聯尙多。不克盡錄。先生平生著述宏富然名士氣重。不自珍惜。隨作隨棄。不留稿本。海上主雜誌報章筆政者。輒取携之。代爲刋布。益散漫不可收拾。先生哲嗣元艮君。近肄業虹口澄衷中學。頗以先人文章遺佚爲憂。商諸於予。擬爲一蒐羅之。以便刋印成集。除錄存十之一二外。亡闕甚多。先生交游殊廣。多士林中人。且掌敎若干年。桃李徧海内。如藏有先生序跋雜作及酬唱諸什。祈鈔寄上海閘北天通庵路上海影戲公司鄭逸梅收。俾先生之專集。得以早日付梓。則存殁俱感。而予忝爲先生門下士。責任所在。尤所盼禱者也。</p>
<p>短訊文明進化之國。莫不好美。凡色聲香味。及一切文藝。莫不求其至精。而觀之近代。則有不然者好色者喜妖冶。好聲者悅鄭衛。不知天地間之有正色正聲也。何謂正色。關睢窈窕之容。何謂正聲。五音六律之正。不知正色者。不足爲明。不知正聲者不足爲聰。人皆曰予智。而於正聲正色不能辨焉。尙得爲聰明乎。　雅樂中能盡五音六律之能事者。厥惟古琴。是古琴爲最高美術之一。乃古今世界所公認。今有半聾居士設社研究古琴。保存國藝。凡好雅樂者。幸勿失此良機焉。社址牯嶺路崇法寺。（精心）</p>

<h3>心上温馨（三）（三）（七）包天笑</h3>
<p>第十六回殷勤問字翠袖謁先生慷慨談兵青樓宴女傑</p>
<p>綠漪是個小姑娘脾氣。初裝了一個電話。充滿了伊的好奇之心。怎麽這們一個怪東西。便可以給老遠的人通話。而且那個電話。雖然是一宅四家人家合用的。可是就裝在扶梯頭上。踏出伊的亭子間一步。再要便當。也没有的了。伊見了那個電話。便要試行打打看。却是對方的電話不多。只有左詩晨報館裏的電話。伊在自已家裏没有裝電話的當兒。早在别人家借打電話時。已經記好。用一小方塊白紙。鉛筆書就的幾個羅馬字。摺疊好藏在梳妝臺小抽斗裏了。此刻伊因爲一種好奇心試打電話。没有地方可以打處。便打到左詩晨的報館裏來。恰恰報館中編輯部裏的電話。就裝在左詩晨所坐的桌子旁邊。其實綠漪起初打那個電話。全出於好奇心。旣打通了電話。不能不敷衍幾句。左詩晨接着了電話。便問是什麽事。但聽得電話中格格的笑聲。笑聲旣畢。便道。你晏歇點來嗎。左詩晨道。敎我來。有什麽事呢。綠漪道。你來了。自然會知道。姆媽有話給你說咧。你要來的呀。我搖斷了。那時左詩晨以爲眞有什麽事。伊的娘眞有什麽話。趕緊把報館裏的事做好了。便向小花園去。有時綠漪出堂唱去了。伊的徐娘式的母親。捧着一隻水烟袋。正斜倚在沙發椅上出神。見了左詩晨去。自然是滿張羅。說阿囡堂唱去哉。馬上就回來的。怎麽昨天不來等等話兒。又說。你再不來。伊說要打電話給你了。左詩晨道。咦·伊剛纔不是打了一個電話給我嗎。伊敎我來的。還說你有話給我說呢綠漪的娘說道。阿呀。我是從小房子裏出來得不多一刻咧。大概伊有話給你二少說。也未可知。伊却没有關照我呢。左詩晨笑道。那末伊是假傳聖旨了。伊的娘道。也許是伊有話要給你說。却推託了我。等一刻兒伊回來了問伊就知道了。過了一忽兒。綠漪回來了。左詩晨道。你給我上當。你說你姆媽有話要和我說。現在問伊。伊一點也没有知道。綠漪掩口而笑。說電話裏不給你這様說。你是不來呀。實在告訴你。我是打打白相的。你問我什麽事。我只得說敎你來。姆媽有什麽話。那是騙騙你的。左詩晨道。原來你是尋開心。我却急急忙忙辦完了事。趕得事。綠漪的娘在旁凑趣道。本來伊說了好幾回。要打電話給你。請你來咧。</p>

<p>昨英美銀市暴跌、惟交易不旺、市况則平、怱由美國出而維持之說、而匯兌略降、神户横濱則無變化至匯豐掛牌外匯因之縮去一擋半、計英金縮三七五、爲一先令五便士、美金七五、計三十四元三七五、印匯縮二元二五、計九十五羅比二五、法郎二十元、計八百七十五元、和洋二元、計八十五兩二五、德匯三元、計一百四十四馬克五坡滙加三兩半、計一百六十三兩五、香港減七五、計七十八兩半、日金遂猛漲三分一二五、計達一兩四錢四分五、惟英金雖掛縮、但無正式之市、而内盤初挺、以後稍有盤旋、因金市倐忽千變、殊難捉摸、迨午時似轉和緩、比較前天計英金尚縮一八七五、美金三七五、日金漲上一分七五之多、殆金價又見新紀元、計達六百五十八兩以外、午後因逢週三、各匯向無市况、華商金業中復已抛出英金、而套進標金、然銀行胃口尙濃如住友朝鮮三井正金等日商銀行買氣尤甚、又華比上海等亦有納進、約共成交二十餘萬鎊、又上海三井時亦售出、聞猶太商喬日甫仍向扒結、各號互相成交數萬鎊、又對做美金一二十萬元、至於日金鮮有出納、殆大條銀因縮過巨、恐有回升之勢云</p>
<p>英　　内盤半日間計有一二五升縮、上午十二一月份出價一先令五便士二五、三四月三一二五、買價均照加○六二五、住友朝鮮於清晨凌道三月及一月一萬五千鎊價三七五、三井朝鮮進三月一萬鎊價三一二五、繼由華比住友進一萬價同、朝鮮進一月五千上海出四月五千同爲二五、三井匯豐互做本月一萬價一八七五、住友買二月一萬價二五、又與正金買四月一萬五千價三七五、三井出三月一萬價同、台灣大通互做十二月一萬、三井進一月五千同爲三一二五住友上海進二萬、價二五、又進三月二萬、價三一二五、係成豐永售出、午收十二月及一月出價二五、三四月三一二五、買價仍加○六二五、下午無市、</p>

<h3>英美銀市復告慘落</h3>
<p>大條僅爲十四辨士半</p>
<p>美銀三角一分六二五</p>
<p>昨據倫敦電訊、大條銀復見慘跌、趨勢尤猛烈於前、續見衝進十五辦士之大關内、開從未到過之新紀鉧、脚地中國稍有賣出、惟别方供給缺少、市况不定收市後買進之價照掛牌放長零六二五美國維持市面甚力、計近遠期均猛跌七五、同爲十四辨士半、（合英金爲一先令五辨士一二五）、又接紐約電訊、美銀價亦隨之暴跌、迭見退進三角二分之關内、計現貨猛跌一分二五之鉅、爲三角一分六二五之新低價、英對美勿更爲四元八角五分三二份之十九、美對英亦無升降、計四元八角五分六二五、日美仍爲四十九元六八七五、日英仍計二先令零三二份之十七、英滬先令短去三七五、爲一先令五辨士七五、孟買無電云、</p>
<h3>釐拆市一致慘淡</h3>
<p>市場概况　銀錢業以今年國暦結賬問題因種種手續及習慣上關係多感不便、乃目下爲時迫促都存觀望、恐届時咸未能一律肅清、故近日市場中交易、異常清淡、人心怠懈逾恒、以致各種市價、多無重大軒輊耳、</p>
<p>厘拆價格（洋厘）早市厘價爲七錢二分四厘半較前日午市又弱二毫半、午市微好一毫二忽半、爲七錢二分四厘六毫二忽半、蓋交易旣寡、人心軟稀、致氣象岑寂、（銀拆）早市六分、午市五分、略跌一分、銀行劃頭加水仍無市價、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋、早市爲六錢五分八厘半、午市跌小一厘、爲六錢五分七厘半、結果較前日午市小去半厘、做出交易、早市四千角、午市一千角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢五分八厘二毫半、午市爲六錢五分八厘、做出交易、早市十四萬角、午市六萬角、銅元微長五百文、爲三百七十二串、</p>

<h3>證劵債市清閒穏定</h3>
<p>昨日公債期市益形寥落、前市成交祇一百六十餘萬、下午亦僅有二百七十餘萬元、合計四百四十三萬元、中一九關尙有一百三十餘萬、裁兵一百餘萬元、現貨雖做開多種、惟成交仍稀少、全日祇開出一萬九千元、前後市債價均盤旋無大變化、較前日漲跌互見、内計一九關及裁兵期貨各跌六七角、編遺及一九關現貨漲起六七角外、其他均僅有一二角漲跌云、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市有立定可能</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、然世界狀况依然不振、大户態度鎭靜、毫無扒空之念、惟底盤較枯、業外者皆不敢抛賣、所以情勢有立定可能、</p>
<p>人標有小回風　人標前市開盤、市氣平淡、二三盤散户購進又漲收盤有一部份賣出回跌、結果各月漲跌一·二·錢、午後開盤平平、二三盤買氣稍盛、各月又漲三·四·五·錢、全日成交統計一萬九千一百包、查賣出義餘一千九百五十包、元泰一千包新華一千一百五十包、達豐七百包、其餘三·四·五·百包、買進天昌一千二百包利昌八百五十包、益昶九百五十包、賡豐七百五十包、其餘三·四·五·六·百包、茲將盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>本月棉呈軋空氣色</h3>
<p>遠月帶動趨俏勢</p>
<p>棉市趨堅因匯兌奇縮而美棉稍漲、散户購進、至於買方在本月拉緊、軋空之意强硬、於是遠月被其牽動、然現棉交易杜絕、廠需岑寂、而查近日印棉進口頗踴、故中外各廠、一無採辦之意、</p>
<p>漢標昂騰二錢　漢標前市開盤、因美棉回漲、外匯變動、人氣仍緊、各漲一二錢、午後市氣仍昂、各月又漲五分至一錢、全日成交統計四萬五千二百擔、查賣出愼昌四千六百擔、源大二千二百擔、信誠一千八百擔、其餘一二千擔、買進天隆四千六百擔、愼記三千六百擔利昌三千三百擔、其餘一二千擔、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>美棉與三品異途</h3>
<p>美棉因抵空轉漲　昨日美棉初因利物浦消息良好而堅、旋因華爾街人心不振而疲、卒因空户抵補再昂、計期貨漲十一至十五磅音、現貨漲十五磅音、英棉期貨漲一二點、現貨漲九點、埃及棉現貨漲十五點、印棉因利物浦消息良好、經紀商購進而堅、計平果爾近遠期漲一羅经、奥姆辣近遠期不動、白羅溪漲一羅比、原電錄左、（十六日專）</p>

<h3>美棉維持失敗</h3>
<p>交易所勸政府放任</p>
<p>紐鄂倫期棉花交易所發表關夜棉花市塲、勸政府取放任方針、此因農務局所施安定棉花市場之政策、悉歸失敗也、蓋過去十五個月間每包已跌落二十四元五角、其所受損失、恰與價値六億元收獲量之减少相當云、</p>
<h3>十一月外棉進口增加</h3>
<p>十一月統計外國原棉進口、計美棉三萬三千○十二包、比十月增加一千四百五十二包印棉四萬○五百六十五包、比月上减二十五包、埃及棉五百五十包、比十月增三百包、缅甸棉六千六百包、比上月增六千四百包、</p>
<h3>糧食白粳米步漲三角</h3>
<p>特頂　達十四元二角</p>
<p>秈米微堅白元平平</p>
<p>閘北　昨日河下到源轉稀、計到二十餘號、市銷因天雨而爽化、各檔買氣甚旺、特頂粳計漲三角之多、高開十四元二角、中次各粳统昂兩角外、情况顔俏按連日産市報緊、出數告稀、故往後米市恐不易下落也、薄稻銷場尙佳、大盤微覺緊切市氣無粳市之活潑、羊杜秈因陰雨人心甚好、高次頗有成交、行情統好兩角之譜、埠秈大盤隨千角左、刻下秈米河存不多、脚地極固、變元與陰元則存到兩厚、去化呆淡、不易起色、價格平庸目前統市存底共計一百二十餘號、除半數北粳外、餘以白元居多、</p>
<p>滬南　昨日各路到十餘號、本街銷遘場活動、北粳高次均提漲兩三角不等、常帮銷化以店胃爲最佳、蘇帮零銷甚暢、南帮薄稻早稻略緊角許、羊秈貨稀銷旺、上漲角半、杜秈到接去平、略轉緊切、通變陰化到銷兩淡、大盤無變化、普通變元勉開十二元五六角</p>
<h3>粉市跌勢又勁</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上下午開盤後、各月份市面又趨銳落之態以洋麥報價兩處又回跌二三至五六七角不等、致全部人心均爲搖動、而一般投機空户、更因大廠家對遠期套出者、約在二十餘萬、致惶恐之情、愈見濃厚、至多頭亦因年關之故、到此檔口、似難再擯、遂亦順勢反賣、市面之回跌、終於重見惟至下午三盤以後、因補空轉勁市氣稍振、結果本月份較前日回小一分二厘半、正月份小二分、二月份小一分七厘、三月份小二分四月份小一分七厘半、五月份小一分半云</p>
<h3>麥市近穏遠跌</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上下午開盤後、各月份呈近穏遠跌之象、本月份因距停拍日近、空方除預備交割外、業外空户祗有逐日補進、如果般遠發生問題、恐不免尙有紛爭也、至遠期各月份以洋麥報價復小人心見疲、且多數空頭、因近期已無法梗爭、餘剩之籌碼、均移轉於遠期因之賣氣見盛市亦見疲、結果本月份較前日反好一分正月份小四分、二月份小六分、三月份至五月份小四分現麥因廠家不動、仍無動靜云</p>
<h3>湖南米到頭日少</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市仍無發展、惟本街續有問津、到頭則有少數之江西南京米、足敷本街去路、到銷兩平、市面居定、湖南米自該省减稅後、略有裝出、近因年底結束、販户均不過問、有餘資之高户、則因該地水淺、且沿途兵匪未靖、亦憚於麻煩也、故日來少到、此後尙有途貨抵埠後、須待明春方有大數來滬、昨日統市成交江西機晚三百八十包、價十一元三角至十元八角半、又機元三百包、價十二元五角至十二元南京機米三百包、價十元零一角半至十元又糙米一百包、價八元六角、又柳米二百包、價十元零一角半、盡係本街辦去云、</p>

<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖跌小一八七五、紐約期糖十二月份跌三分、明年九月份跌四分、爪哇期現糖仍乏升沉公會粗砂白、初時以外滙之猛昻、人氣頗强、喊價殊高、買户寥寥、旋以賣意漸濃、成交價仍八兩四錢半、交易不多、二十號中砂白七兩六錢半、市上缺俏、後喊七兩七錢尙少問津、日糖ＹＴ嘜八兩五錢半至八兩五錢ＹＰ嘜九兩、明治貨九兩○五分、ＹＲ嘜八兩○五分、Ｎ嘜八兩八錢、市象平稳、太古○嘜即裝貨續開一千包、價仍五兩四錢半、新規加稅、號盤有炳昌號售出現貨八號荷赤一千袋、價七兩二錢、要手零落、國貨上冰白開漲十一兩一錢、高貨喊十一兩五錢、尙乏成交、市頗堅挺、新青糖二批續到六千包、開價仍爲原盤七兩二錢貨則較高、市頗俏手、聞明後日尙有二百餘包乂到以應市需云</p>
<h3>絲茶皖繭價仍堅挺</h3>
<p>本埠滬乾繭市面、依然清平、綠各繭商手中執有餘繭者、類均堅持高價方售、各廠商以洋莊絲價小、虧本太巨、無意補購、市氣擯持、昨日鎭江某廠商進皖乾繭三百八十包、七百五十斤、繅折價開七十六兩、繭本須扯五百六七十兩、外加繭工二百餘兩、絲本須八百餘兩、廠商按照現市絲價、須虧本百兩左右、</p>

<p>藝術界</p>
<h3>最近的印象華林</h3>
<p>西哲有云、「人是個藝術家、他的生活、也是個藝術品」、藝術品、就是各人用各種方法、去表現他們各各不同的世界、要知道人生最高貴之生活條件、就是「努力」即如我最近在上海與一般藝術界所接觸的機會、如汪亞塵榮君立之展覽會、及上海藝術專校之展覽會、亦足見諸君之努力、前天星期日、午後特去到江灣路上海藝專看他們的成績、樓下都是陳列的學生作品、學生生活、本來是糼稚·天眞·頑耍·大胆·將來自然能造成精幹·智慧·奮鬥·勇猛的青年作家、及至上樓、博覽敎員的作品中、如朱應鵬之雄偉、陳抱一之清雅、王道源之沉鬱、倪貽德之興趣、有追求之力量的、要算朱應鵬、享樂者就是陳抱一、苦悶的是王道源、隨意的是倪貽德、裝飾晝之精妙、如陳之佛乃按規就矩之人、足見一陳列室内、世界各有不同、如陳抱一與王道源所繪的二女像、一者如初放鮮花、正在茂盛、一者如雨後花殘、還吐芳微笑、倪貽德之女像、即其愛人、宜乎天氣晴明也、又如汪榮一對情侶、遨游南歐、飽吸意大利之風光、在法取世界名作而摹臨之、亦正其興會不淺、非如我之悲觀厭世、「愛與恨」造成不可解决之人生、</p>
<h3>上海藝專的兩位天才青年孟雲</h3>
<p>丨丨曾志良氏丨丨楊秋亼氏</p>
<p>看過了上海藝專的成績展覽會、眞像在我這枯燥的心境中、加過些葡萄汁玫瑰漿上去、</p>
<p>最値得我羨慕的、上海藝專是佔有了適宜的校含、前面的虹口公園、側面的六三花園、後面的鄉居綠野、春風到了是他們最先領着、秋葉落了也是他們最先知道、其他如朝陽晚霞、到處都足以引誘他們繪畫的興趣、連日藝專的成績畫展、更使江灣路上充滿了藝術空氣、江灣路丨丨眞是我們的「薔薇之路」、在這「薔薇之路」上、佈滿着凄寂·憂鬱·温柔·清新的情調、畫家們詩人們支配在這種環境之下、應該有天才的流露、感情的發現、果然、藝專的確有兩位富於天才的青年畫家、連日報紙上對於該校敎授們的作品差不多都記載過、現在我且介紹値得我們注意的兩位天才畫家吧、</p>
<p>第一位、曾志良氏、他的作品有點與倪貽德氏相似、筆觸到處、都使我們像服下强奮劑一般、那一種强而有力的様子、實足表現我國現代的革命精神、我知道這位天才的畫家、一定是個「熱的青年」這次他的出品祇有幾幅、有一幅是繪着一個臥在沙發上的「裸女」、又稍爲變動了他的作風、那色彩的濃厚、構圖的巧妙、筆觸的精細、表現出室内的温和、少女的幽靜情懷、實爲該畫會生色的作品、　　第二位、楊秋人氏、他的作品比曾志良氏多、可惜臨稿的小幅風景畫佔了多數、表現不出他的個性、且臨畫總失却了空間藝術的自然空氣、但他有光艶的色彩、足夠我們欣賞、</p>
<p>之、我們寂寞的藝術界裏、正需要着他們這些偉大的安鬆、我護在這裏禱祝着、願他們永遠一致努力的研究下去、同時、我還要向王道源倪貽　陳抱一朱應麟議位先生道賀、賀他們敎授有方、能夠造就成這兩位天才的畫家、</p>
<h3>日本帝展洋畫巡覽日本通信謝海燕</h3>
<p>（三續）</p>
<p>一氣說了這許多、還滔滔地覺得不所欲言、然迫於時間、不得不從速把今回帝展所見的作品、凡稍有討論價値的、一概介紹出來、</p>
<p>劈頭、就是北蓮藏氏的「泰山木」第一次的印象、便給我一個不愉快、缽頭大的花、巴掌大的葉、在那種裝作的眩目的技倆裏頭、簡直淘不出一些繪畫美的分子出來、故此、周其說、這是一幅畫、無寗說、這是一幅湘繡、</p>
<p>其次、就是今年帝國美術院賞的特選大作丨中村研一氏的「弟妹相聚」、誠然在場中、這幅畫是堪稱爲出類據萃的皇后的、只那龐大的畫幅、和那幾位有體面的人物、已夠捉攝一般觀客的傾仰底視線了、畫面的構成、和色彩的照應、雖没有可嫌的地方、但坐着的人物、和右角上舞蹈的人物、各人的顔面、都朝着同一的方向、像照相的時候、大家一齊望着鏡頭、靜止不動時的情景、這個缺點、給這幅畫塗上不少的污痕、</p>
<p>再次、就是中山正實氏的「母子像」打破從來文學的典型、高架着自我的橋樑、達到幻夢的鏡地去、惟惜空間的觀念太淺、色彩與畫面隔離、有格格不相入之慨、</p>
<p>鈴木誠氏的「LetreGrazje（三女神）這張畫、矛盾的地方很多、最大的毛病、就是下部的好調子欠均整、没有歸着的效果、</p>
<p>長屋勇氏的「湖畔、」是描寫一大羣裸女體憩於湖畔的情景、同様的失了歸着的效果和有機的結合、好像由人體的習作中、把裸女一個個地剪貼在一幅大風景畫似的、</p>
<p>小系源太郎氏的「暮春閑情」、精緻異常、我要送他一面扁額、刻着「巧奪天工」四字、</p>
<p>渡邊百合子的「莊園的某日」捨去小的、握住大的、是風景人物描法的三眛、作者大概能注意到這一點、</p>
<p>再談到南薰造氏的「朝、」是一幅靜止的澄清的水景、水舟數葉、浮在爽朗酣朝的湖墘、丨在這裏、我們可窺得作者優雅的態度和詩味的感情、氏爲日本水彩畫會、白日會、和帝國美術委員、曾建殊勳於黎明期的日本美術界、當是時、正當脂派（不同舍系丨太平洋畫會的開山祖）與紫派（白馬會系丨光風會前身）對立的跋扈時代、即一般官學派的作家們、還在醉夢裏株守着古典的敎條、一方面在追從著寫實派、一方面又在摸倣着浪漫派的混沌時代、氏歸國後、即努力從事於改造連動、同有島生馬（二科會員）等氏、創刋「白樺」美術雜誌、灌輸毆西新時代的息潮、搗毅CezanneGanguinGogh,及Matisse等後期印象派作品的複製寫眞版、給燃燒於新知識的青年、以偉大的感化、同時、他的飽含詩情的軟的作品、能硬化地把觀慣了白馬會系等作品的衆眼、引到另一不同的境地來、</p>
<p>使人惋惜不置的、是看了和出三造氏的「婆婆的像」之後、氏爲日本畫壇的幸運的天才者、費有名的處作作「南風、」在第一回文展發表驚動了整個的日本藝術界、歎爲怪傑、故世有麒麟兒之稱、後來、政府特地派他到法蘭西去留學、但結果失望、回國以來、除每年在帝展的一隅、佔到一席地位、掛他底敷衍的無意味的Academy的小作品之外、一點没有作爲、近來、聽說他已經到靜岡縣、研究染色的工藝去了、</p>
<p>草光信成氏的「前庭、」是特種神經流露的魅力、捉住一種詩情夢幻的境地、指示給人們神秘的甜美的慰安、</p>
<p>日本畫壇老將講谷國四郎氏的「朝、「是油畫、不、倒不如呌做油繪的裝飾畫吧、這個名稱定了、然後、玩評纔不致會没有頭緖、鉛色的布幕、和黄色的人體、映成色的調和的音階、奏出縹緲的幸福人生的清韻、在甜爽的朝、追憶甜爽的夢、此老幾乎無庸我再來介紹、他是著名的舊脂派的中堅人物、到二十幾年前第二度渡歐時、纔受了野獸羣（Fauvisme）的洗禮、然而、他並不怎様去做一個忠實的野獸羣的承繼者、在現時間、因環境的妥協、無形中、死去的Academy臭味的灰燼、復重燃起來了、（未完）</p>

<h3>變動湯增敡</h3>
<p>李贊華作</p>
<p>前鋒月刋第二期</p>
<p>民族主義文藝運動自普羅文學没落的今年發動以來它所進展的速率是爲一般研究文藝者所不能推想得到的因爲這種具有偉大意義的運動是根據着歷史的决定客觀社會的需要與及正確中心思想的理論所以它能在發運的最短期間便轟動了國内外的文壇這確是不能否認的事實在這偉大的有深刻意義的運動中所發行的刋物最使我們注意的當然就是繼轟動一時的前鋒周報之後這異軍突起的「前鋒月刋」了它在國内實可以說是唯一的傾重於理論的大刋物它底態度的嚴正内容的充實取材的精密都爲國内雜誌界所創見尤其是關於創作選擇極形愼重這様始不會陷於最近的各大刋物濫選創作的覆轍編者這種精密的眼光與嚴格的態度是値得我們重視的所以「前鋒月刋」上所載的短篇創作在量的方面雖然是很少在質的方面却把握着創作的最高峰僅這一點就可以確定它所具有的藝術價値的一斑了</p>
<p>在這一期裏創作祗有贊華所作的一篇「變動」這是描寫中國鄉村裏的變動具有濃烈的地方色彩所表現這時代中的矛盾更爲詳盡可喜他所寫的故事的内容是這様的</p>
<p>主人公臘梅阿娘是中國鄉村裏的典型婦人她生平唯一的企望就是她家欄裏所飼養着的一頭猪這種充滿着民族主義地方色彩的史實在現今是應該加以刻畫的作者把握着這個重心便由極形細微之處有秩序的擴大描寫下去在開端作者就把應該表現的人物的性格活躍在我們的眼前例如</p>
<p>臘梅阿娘的猪是那麽肥那麽高大常逗起臘梅阿娘的笑容這笑容在周圍十餘里的梅家莊是不很常見年歲不好大家有的祇是皺眉皺眉的人自已難得笑更不願看别人笑臘梅阿娘心裏很明白村裏人的情形笑容也就收歛得很快望着猪獃獃地暗自盤算到年底這又是一注錢了償清梅大爺的債替小臘梅製件新衣餘賸的買個小猪明年又是這麽高大這麽肥這様一年年下去不難替死鬼臘梅爺爭口氣這些希望都在猪身上猪不會答話但繞着她的膝很親暱似乎並不會負她這番希望歡喜又佔據她的心笑的浪紋不期然地又在她瘦削的臉上蔓延開來</p>
<p>這様的表現是多的緊凑而有力作者對於鄉村婦人的心理所寫頗爲細膩這也是作者最特長的一點但是在現實的鄉村裏像臘梅阿娘這様的平靜地過去在事實上是不可能的了所以從這天之後所謂極形平靜的梅家莊空氣突然地緊張起來當然鄉村裏所遭共黨擾亂是無論如何不能避免的像這種慘無人道恐怖的事件當然使臘梅阿娘引起懼怕的心然而臘梅阿娘最擔心是她有那麽一頭猪是那麽肥那麽高大</p>
<p>終久據一般的傳說「那件事那件不很平常的事」又要降臨了臘梅阿娘是一個苦守的婦人還有一個僅僅十四歲的小臘聽到那件不很平常的事來到在她底内心當然是充滿着恐懼的波紋但是這鄰舍裏的鬍子阿伯却是一個忠實的農民他是時時刻刻照顧臘梅阿娘的因爲那事件一天天地迫近她靜悄地死守着一頭肥而高大的猪是不可能的了最後臘梅阿娘終於忍着痛跟着大家走了她祇「望着猪帶不上山只是哭」這種逃命的情景是値得深加刻畫的同時作者描寫鄉村裏的景况一字一句都是異常的精到更以最經濟的手腕加以極形緊凑的叙述但是我們讀了之後便能很透徹地明白這鄉村裏的情景了關於此如果對於藝術没有深刻修養的人是無論如何不能寫得這様的圓熟而獨到例如</p>
<p>陽光矖在背上包袱是那麽累贅她流着汗和前面的一行列在漸漸地離遠了</p>
<p>横在前面的是座嶺是高得嚇人有些人在嶺走有些人也在落後了他記起了這座嶺嶺上有個神廟那裏有個和尙和尙從前便是那麽老現在光景是不容冕再見了大家脚步都朝那方走這也許是往廟廟去這様緊凑的經濟的描寫差不多全篇都是文筆旣簡潔又老練這更使我們特别引爲注意之點同時作者描寫共黨的擾亂是以側面的但是在我們讀了之後便能明瞭實是慘無人道的一件事「大家明白了七分光景是那様事果然來了於是各自在黑黯中尋着了自已的人攙着走心裏慌脚下越不得快走出廟門梅家莊那邊是一片火光照着天是那様紅大家嚇得抖不敢放聲哭」這様毌須說是可以使我們看到當時殺人放火的共黨在那裏表演着慘無人道的事情不必一定要哧人似的在描寫着作者這種深刻的筆緻在國内創作界却可說是創見同時這様的筆緻更能表現得不平凡的生動深深地打動讀者的心坎的作者長於心理的分析尤其是屬於鄉村裏的人物這是讀了「變動」的人都可以知道至於對話的流利簡潔結構的緊凑圓熟更是作者所獨到之處在今日一般的農村正是這様的在變動着所以表現這一時代的矛盾的尖端作品是極形需要安底産生在民族主義文藝運動製作有力的創作中</p>
<p>這篇偉大的創作作者是已經深深地把握着這一時代的重心實可說牠是不易多得的力作</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Meeting of the Central Political Council</h3>
<p>Discussing Budget Proposals from Various Agencies</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council met on the morning of the 17th. Attendees included Hu Hanmin, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Song Ziwen, Wang Chonghui, Zhu Peide, Zhang Renjie, Lin Sen, Li Wenfan, He Yingqin, Shao Yuanchong, Wang Zhengting, Kong Xiangxi, Wu Tiecheng, and Wang Boqun, Chen Lifu, and others. Hu Hanmin presided. First, Song Ziwen of the Finance Ministry reported that the abolition of likin has been decided and will be implemented on New Year's Day next year without further delay. They are now discussing ways to compensate for the tax revenue loss. Next, they discussed the budget proposals for various agencies for the 19th year. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Arrears in expenses for overseas embassies and consulates have reached over 2.4 million. The Foreign Affairs Group of the Central Political Council held a meeting last week to discuss this issue and has submitted the results to the Central Political Council. It has now been resolved that the Ministry of Finance should promptly allocate funds to facilitate diplomacy. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Political, Economic, and Legal Groups of the Central Political Council held a joint meeting on the morning of the 17th to discuss the anti-smoking proposal resolved at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. The results have been finalized and will be reported to the Central Political Council. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Scope of the New Year's Day Amnesty</h3>
<p>Lawyers' Association Suggests to the National Government</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the scope of the amnesty, the Executive and Judicial Yuan have revised it in two meetings. However, the procedures for reducing the sentences of those to be pardoned are still considered necessary for further study by the two Yuan. They are still studying the issue these days and intend to make the process simple and quick so that those pardoned can be released early after the amnesty decree is issued. The case is expected to be finalized before the 19th and will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. As for the scope of the amnesty, it is said that, except for special provisions, all other political prisoners will generally be pardoned. The scope of those who cannot be pardoned includes: (1) Communists (based on Jiang's telegram); (2) Those who have engaged in treasonous acts, referring to the criminal law concerning crimes against foreign aggression; (3) Those who have betrayed the Party and the country, with the exception of the main culprits, the rest should be treated with leniency as a principle. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Lawyers Association has made suggestions to the National Government regarding the New Year's Day amnesty case: (1) There are two types of amnesty: general amnesty and special amnesty. A general amnesty can eliminate the effect of a criminal sentence, while a special amnesty can exempt the execution of all criminal penalties. If it is already specified that all Communists who are not heinous criminals or incorrigibly evil, as well as those who have engaged in treasonous acts, are included in the general amnesty, then all political prisoners included in the general amnesty, those who have been sentenced, should fundamentally have the effect of the criminal sentence eliminated, and those who have not been sentenced should be treated the same as those who have not committed a crime. How can there still be a reduction or exemption based on the severity of the crime? To reduce or exempt based on the severity of the crime is only a reduction of sentence, not a general amnesty or special amnesty. (2) Ordinary criminals with strong criminal tendencies, such as those who have committed murder or robbery, are undoubtedly guilty, but those who have fallen into crime due to objective political instability and are imprisoned are also pitiful. Now that the Party and the country have been rebuilt, it is time to embrace renewal together. Furthermore, those who have caused political disturbances due to errors in political views can still be treated with leniency. Therefore, it seems unbearable to exclude those who have unfortunately committed crimes due to the influence of the political environment from the scope of the amnesty. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Headquarters Sends Personnel to Review the Army</h3>
<p>Review Personnel Divided into Three Groups</p>
<p>Reorganization of Bandit Suppression Troops Postponed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the past, during the military period, the organization and number of personnel in each division varied greatly. Now that the suppression of rebellious military affairs has been settled, personnel should be sent to investigate as soon as possible in order to standardize them. It has been decided that for all divisions that create and receive military pay directly from the central government, personnel will be sent to review and investigate the exact number of personnel, weapons, ammunition, and academic subjects. They will be divided into three groups, each with one director and six members. The candidates for director have been determined to be Wu Qingzhi, Wang Baoai, Cai Peiyuan, Ying Xi, Fan Yuhuang, and Wang Qi, among others. Each group will be composed of two infantry officers, one military doctor, one quartermaster, and one artillery and engineering officer each. Candidates are still being sought. They are expected to depart from Nanjing in early January and complete their task within one and a half months. The troops to be reviewed will be those along the Jinpu, Longhai, Pinghan, and Jiaoji Railways, with the Longhai Railway extending to Tongguan. The bandit suppression troops and the armies of Shanxi, Gansu, and Shaanxi will be reviewed later. It was also decided that the General Staff Office will convene a meeting of the directors of each group on the morning of the 18th to discuss the review methods. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government has formulated a new table of organization for the divisions of various armies and ordered the divisions of various armies to follow the table to reduce their size.

The national military expenditure budget will be set at 12 million yuan per month, divided into three types of divisions (A, B, and C), and distributed accordingly. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>After the Headquarters is Dissolved, the Garrison Continues to Exist</h3>

The Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief is organized temporarily for the convenience of wartime command. Now that the military affairs have been completed, it should be dissolved. However, when the Chairman of the National Government leaves the capital to command military operations, he is the Commander-in-Chief. In the future, the headquarters and garrisons in various locations will continue to exist in the smallest possible organization to handle matters related to the Commander-in-Chief and to serve as the residence of the Commander-in-Chief when he goes on tour.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>World Affairs and Human Effort</h3>
<p>All things in the world are created by human effort. However, once they are created, they cannot be transformed by human effort in a short period of time. There is no reason why things created by human effort cannot be transformed by human effort. It is simply that the creation did not happen overnight, so the transformation will also not happen overnight. The human effort required for transformation must be equal to the human effort at the time of creation for the effect of the transformation to be seen. If the effort is not equal, even if human effort is used, the effect will not be immediately seen. People in the world do not observe this. When they encounter long-standing problems, they suddenly realize them and want to use the power of a few people to transform the problems in a short period of time. If there is no effect, they immediately say that the problems cannot be eradicated by human effort. Is it not that they initially overestimate their human effort and then underestimate it? In reality, human effort is still human effort. What took a certain amount of human effort to create will take a certain amount of human effort to transform. There is no room for luck or discouragement in between.</p>
<p>Let me give an example to prove what I am saying. Today, the value of gold in the world is rising, while the value of silver is falling, and it is becoming increasingly severe. Commerce is declining, and unemployment is increasing. Countries around the world are trying to save the price of silver, boost commerce, and provide relief to the unemployed. However, none of them have been effective. This is because the low price of silver, the decline in commerce, and unemployment are the result of the accumulation of various human efforts in the past. They cannot be successfully and effectively dealt with by the limited remedial efforts of today. If the remedial efforts continue to increase from now on, there will be a day when they will be effective.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Plan to Compensate for Abolishing Likin</h3>
<p>Must Await the Return of Investigation Commissioners to the Capital Before Decisions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The abolition of likin and various taxes similar to likin is less than half a month away. Regarding the new tax plan to compensate for the abolition of likin, the Special Tax Preparation Office of the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Reorganization Research Committee are currently meeting to discuss the issue. A decision will only be made after the commissioners investigating taxes in the eight provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Shandong, and Henan return to the ministry and report. According to the reports from the eight provinces, after the abolition of likin, there will still be a shortfall of more than 13 million yuan, even after special consumption taxes are used to compensate. The shortfall in compensation from regular customs duties, sub-port duties, re-import duties, railway freight surcharges, postal package taxes, and landing taxes is approximately 4 million yuan. The loss of income after the abolition is estimated to be approximately 17 to 18 million yuan. Whether there is actually such a large number still depends on the investigation report to have an accurate number. If there is indeed such a number and the compensation is insufficient, then the collection rate of new taxes such as factory output and sales will have to be increased. However, no matter what, it will definitely be insufficient to compensate. If it is absolutely necessary, the central government will temporarily provide subsidies from the increased amount of customs duties and other national taxes. At the same time, various old taxes will be reorganized in due course, and new taxes will be carefully planned so that there will be no major financial difficulties after the abolition of likin. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The diplomatic corps expressed satisfaction with Song Ziwen's telegram regarding the implementation of likin abolition on New Year's Day. However, two or three countries are concerned about whether all disguised forms of likin will be thoroughly eliminated after the abolition of likin. The British and American sides believe that the day of the implementation of likin abolition will be the time when foreign countries begin to invest in China. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui Postpones Departure to Return Home</h3>
<p>Recent Correspondence from Mo and Karakhan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Mo Dehui from Moscow on the 15th, stating that he had formally notified Karakhan on the 12th, saying that he intended to return home temporarily due to matters, and that he had appointed Liu Zhirong, a specialized commissioner, to temporarily act as the head of the delegation office.

<h3>Sun Ke Reports on the Situation of Military Troops Detaining Trains</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 16th, Sun Ke telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, saying, "I previously received instructions to investigate the detention of trains by various military troops in order to limit them and order their return. I immediately followed your instructions and reported. Now, according to a telegram from the Jinpu Railway Bureau, Chen Zongzhi has replied that the detained vehicles can only be returned after the bandit communists have been suppressed. However, Chen's troops have now dispatched vehicles to transport coal from the Lieshan Coal Mine. In addition, the vehicles detained by Han Fuju and Ma Hongkui's troops are also being used to control fees and transport commercial goods. Military troops detaining vehicles have been repeatedly ordered by you to return them within a limited time, but the various military troops have not fully complied. Now, Chen's troops are using the pretext of suppressing bandits to dispatch vehicles to transport coal, and Han Fuju and Ma Hongkui's troops are detaining vehicles to control them, collecting fees and transporting goods, which seems to indicate that they have no sincerity in returning the vehicles. The exact number of vehicles detained by various military troops that have not been returned has been verified. On the Pinghan Railway, 23 locomotives and approximately 300 passenger and freight cars have been detained by Shi Yousan's troops. 11 locomotives and 250 passenger and freight cars have been detained by Sun Lianzhong's troops. 2 locomotives and 18 passenger and freight cars have been detained by Chen Diaoyuan's troops. 4 locomotives and 80 passenger and freight cars have been detained by Wan Dianzun's troops. On the Jinpu Railway, 11 locomotives and 146 passenger and freight cars have been detained by Han Fuju's troops. 4 locomotives and 51 passenger and freight cars have been detained by Ma Hongkui's troops. 4 locomotives and 105 passenger and freight cars have been detained by Chen Diaoyuan's troops. On the Jiaoji Railway, 32 passenger and freight cars have been detained by Han Fuju's troops. 1 freight car has been detained by the 74th Division. 3 freight cars have been detained by the 77th Division. 1 freight car has been detained by the 20th Division. On the Longhai Railway, a total of 12 locomotives and 380 passenger and freight cars have been detained by various military troops. On the Daocheng Railway, 3 locomotives and 76 passenger and freight cars have been detained by various military troops. Such detention and failure to return is detrimental to transportation. It is proposed to telegram the various military troops again to order them to return the vehicles immediately in accordance with previous orders in order to maintain transportation and alleviate commercial difficulties."

<p>News from Moscow: The Soviet Russian authorities have recently decided to pay full attention to the armament of its people, and at least 21 million Soviet men and women citizens will receive full and organized military education. According to the report of the Russian Vosaviakhim (translated as Air Force and Chemical Warfare Defense Association), this goal is not difficult to achieve. Currently, the association has 3 million members and plans to increase to 21 million within three years. The purpose of the association is to enable all Soviet Russian men, women, old and young, to use rifles and gas masks to defend against the theoretical armed attacks of capitalism on socialism.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Mo Teh-hui Requests Leave to Return Home</h3>
<p>Mo Expected to Return to the Country by Year's End</p>
<p>Diplomatic Courier Discusses the Conference Situation</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch – Mo Teh-hui’s return to China has become a certainty. According to a telegram received by the Director's Office of the Chinese Eastern Railway from Mo, he will depart on December 16th and is expected to return to China before the Lunar New Year's Eve. He will first return to Harbin and then proceed to Beijing after the New Year. Regarding the four special commissioners newly appointed by the central government, he believes that the selection of personnel requires careful consideration, and their departure to Russia should be postponed until he returns to the country to discuss with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before making a decision. After Mo leaves Russia, the duties of the plenipotentiary representative will be temporarily handled by the chief commissioner Liu Zherong. The leave has been approved for one and a half months. However, Mo suffers from severe insomnia and needs to seek medical treatment, so one and a half months of leave may not be enough. It is reported that the sole reason for Mo's return to China this time is to request instructions regarding the policies of resuming transportation and trade, as the orders received when departing the country were limited to discussing matters within the scope of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Although the central government has issued telegram instructions regarding the resumption of transportation and trade, they are not detailed enough. After the continuation of the conference, the two special committees on transportation and trade have not yet begun discussions, one due to the absence of our special commissioners, and the other due to the relatively</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>significant impact. It is necessary to wait for Mo to return to the country, request instructions from the central government, and determine the policies before he can accompany the newly added special commissioners to Russia and begin discussions on these two matters. Currently, the three special committees are meeting, with only the Chinese Eastern Railway group meeting daily to sort out various cases related to the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau Director, the Board of Directors, the Chairman, the Directors and Supervisors, the Audit Bureau, and land matters. This time, the group meetings involve assigning various proposals to the appropriate committee for preliminary discussion based on their nature. After the committee makes a decision, the committee members sign the proposal, which is then submitted to the general meeting. After discussion, it is either passed or rejected. In reality, this is equivalent to a preparatory meeting. Today at 2:45 PM, Chuan Zhanwen, the diplomatic courier of our delegation, returned to Harbin. I interviewed him in the car and asked about the progress of the conference. According to him, the Sino-Russian conference did resume on the 4th of this month. Since it was a continuation of the previous conference, there was no opening ceremony. Since the start of the conference, it has been progressing smoothly. The Khabarovsk Protocol, which had been a source of contention for months, is no longer mentioned by the Russian side. The reason why this conference could continue to be convened is due to the exchange of letters between Mo and Jia. The expert committees are divided into three groups to discuss issues such as the resumption of diplomatic relations, the Chinese Eastern Railway, and trade. The groups for the resumption of diplomatic relations and trade have not yet started due to the insufficient number of our experts. The Chinese Eastern Railway group has been meeting daily since the 4th of this month, and the situation is progressing well. When I returned to China on the 4th of this month, the Plenipotentiary Mo had no intention of leaving. The return to China for a report was decided recently. The recent situation of the delegation is all good (12th).</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Calm in the Guangxi War</h3>
<p>Zhang and Gui's Attempt to Enter Yunnan Has Failed</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch – Previously, because the Cantonese army was preparing to use air squadrons to bomb Nanning in Guangxi Province, the Zhang and Gui armies in Nanning City moved their troops to the Zuoyou River, intending to take the opportunity to flee to Yunnan to forage for supplies. It is now reported that this action by the Zhang and Gui armies seems to have failed. When the Zhang and Gui armies initially planned to invade Yunnan, in addition to deploying two units of troops to directly attack Poai and Kunming, they also mobilized disgruntled military personnel in Yunnan Province, such as a Mr. Tang and a Mr. Wu, to respond in Yunnan. However, recently, Mr. Wu and others in Yunnan had no opportunity to act. The Zhang and Gui armies, realizing that internal support had failed, dared not launch a long-distance invasion into Yunnan. Furthermore, the Chairman of Yunnan, Long Yun, not only had sufficient military strength to suppress internal unrest, but also had surplus strength to assist the retreating Lu Han troops on the Yunnan border, continuously increasing troops on the Yunnan border and strictly preventing the Zhang and Gui armies from attempting to invade. It is reported that in addition to dispatching the Wang Brigade Supplementary Regiment some time ago, recently, the Zhang Fengchun unit has been fully deployed, rushing to Bose to join forces with the Lu Division, preparing to counterattack the enemy forces in Enlong. The Zhang and Gui armies, seeing that Yunnan Province had sufficient strength and had deployed troops on the border, hesitated and dared not move westward, and are now stationed in Bose and Longzhou. This is the reason why the situation on the Yunnan-Guangxi border has gradually calmed down. As for Nanning, the rear of the Zhang and Gui armies, the war is still calm. The reason for this is that the Zhang and Gui armies have largely withdrawn from Yong City and moved far away to the Zuoyou River. In addition, the 8th Route Army recently suppressed bandits on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border. For the sake of defense, the Cantonese army had to make appropriate adjustments to its forces in Guangxi and transfer troops back to Guangdong to consolidate its defenses on the North River. Currently, in addition to deploying the Yu Hanmou and Huang Renhuan units to defend the northwest of Nanning and the Yang Dingzhong and Chen Hanguang units to defend the southeast of Yong City to closely monitor the enemy, the Li Yangjing division stationed in Dahe has withdrawn the Tan Langxing regiment back to Guangdong, and the Yan Ying regiment will also return east. Therefore, the situation in the vicinity of Nanning has become more moderate. Judging from this situation, the recent situation in Guangxi has entered a state of truce again (December 11th).</p>
<h3>Cantonese Army Repulses Communist Bandits Spying on Nanxiong</h3>
<p>400 Captured Alive, Countless Killed, Remainder Flee to Dayu</p>
<p>Headquarters Continues to Send More Troops to Defend the North River</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch – Communist bandits on the Jiangxi border, after being pursued and suppressed step by step by the major armies of Jiangxi Province, have recently had a portion of dispersed bandits flee into Nanxiong on the Guangdong border. Huang Keng, Nanxiong, was ravaged by the bandits. The County Magistrate Wu Wentong, in addition to leading troops to retreat to the county seat and mobilizing the Chengkou militia to defend it, also urgently telegraphed the provincial authorities, requesting reinforcements to block and suppress the bandits. After receiving the emergency telegram from the county, the 8th Route Army Headquarters immediately dispatched the Tan Langxing regiment stationed in Shaozhou on the 9th to Nanxiong. Separately, the province dispatched the Wu Jianxiong unit of the 246th Regiment of the 62nd Division, which was concentrated in the Sibiaoying outside the northern suburbs on the morning of the 9th. The Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang and the 62nd Division Commander Xiang Hanping personally went to give a speech. After the speech, the regiment arrived at Huangsha Station at 7:00 AM and boarded eighteen Cantonese-Shaozhou vehicles, heading north at 9:00 AM. At about 7:00 PM that afternoon, the Wu regiment arrived in Shaozhou and continued north from Shaozhou on the morning of the 10th. In the afternoon of the 10th, a portion of the Wu regiment, after passing through Kaimada Shixing, were deployed separately. Currently, Nanxiong, Shaozhou, and Shixing are filled with troops from the Tan Langxing, Deng Hui, and Wu Jianxiong regiments. The Wang Dinghua regiment is deployed to the Xiaobei River, while the regimental headquarters is still stationed in Yingde, providing support. Because Lianyang, Yangshan, and Hanguang in Xiaobei River all have local communist bandits, the Wang regiment is solely responsible for the Xiaobei River defense. It is reported that two infantry battalions, one mortar platoon, and one machine gun platoon of the regiment set off for Yangshan on the 11th. Xiaobei River is far from Jiangxi, so the authorities only use the Wang regiment for defense. Nanxiong, Shixing, and Shaozhou are close to the Jiangxi border, so the main forces of the Tan and Wu regiments were sent to block and suppress the bandits. As for the Deng Hui regiment, because it was newly established, the entire regiment has been replacing new-style firearms since yesterday. In order to supply the various regiments with military supplies, the headquarters specially transported a large batch of bullets and entrenching tools, such as hoes and steel shovels, from the arsenal on the 11th and transported them to Shaozhou for distribution to the soldiers in the front. Today, the provincial security team, the 2nd regiment of Fan Zongchi, was also dispatched to Shaozhou. The 1st Battalion of He Jiarui, the 2nd Battalion of Wu Zhenyao, and the 3rd Battalion of Liang Junsheng, after receiving orders, set off from Huangpu Hudiegang this morning and came to the provincial capital to gather at Huangsha to await orders. Recently, the reduction in Nanxiong is related to the national tax revenue, which is no small matter. Therefore, the people in Nanxiong have contact with the communist bandits for food. It is claimed that the regiment arrived in Xiongcheng on the evening of the 9th, and the 1st and 2nd Battalions and machine gun and artillery platoons immediately rushed to Huangkeng to suppress the remaining bandits. The two sides fought each other, and the artillery fire was fierce. Later, thousands of local militias and armed groups flanked the bandits. The bandits were attacked from both sides and scattered after a while. Countless were killed, 400 were captured alive, and the rest fled to Dayu. They are still being pursued (December 12th).</p>
<h3>Mu Xiangyue Asks to Avoid a Government Position</h3>
<p>Writes to Kong Xiangxi, Asking Him Not to Honor Him With the Appointment</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry has been newly established, but the Vice-Minister has not yet been announced. Former Permanent Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Mu Ouchu yesterday sent a letter to Minister Kong, requesting that he not be honored with the appointment. The original letter is as follows: "Minister, I, Xiangyue, with my meager talents, have been wrongly entrusted with a heavy responsibility. I am grateful for your kind selection, and I am always mindful of the abyss. Since taking office, I have been diligently striving to manage affairs, hoping to achieve the effect of benefiting commerce and industry. I am ashamed that I have not lived up to your expectations. I believe that in industrial and commercial administration, expertise and experience are both valuable, but the most important thing is to be able to handle matters appropriately. Looking back on last year's inspection of policies, I was fortunate to see its success. However, the national plan could not be implemented due to a lack of funds. Since there was little external development, I attempted internal reorganization, resulting in the organization of statistics for various industries, which took six months, but the results were difficult to describe. This is not due to the incompetence of my colleagues, but rather to my own lack of intelligence. Moreover, since there were no statistics for various industries, the difficulty of starting from scratch is the same in ancient and modern times. This is something that the Minister is well aware of. I originally planned to retire this spring to make way for more talented individuals, but I was unwell, and the country faced many difficulties, so I had to reluctantly take on the difficult task and expose my shortcomings. However, I found that reviewing routine documents was already tedious, and I felt even more desolate when I retired from public life. I spent my days reviewing old documents and sadly contemplating my own reflection. Now that the overall situation is unified and politics are being reformed, and this Ministry has been ordered to reorganize into the Ministry of Industry, adding agriculture, forestry, mining, and other major industries in addition to the original industry and commerce, your plans for enriching the country are well-defined, and your expertise is commendable. I lack the talent to assist you, especially since agriculture and forestry are the foundation of all industries. For more than a decade, those who have studied these industries have not heard of them being organized using scientific methods. This is also a major reason for the decline of agriculture and forestry. Now that you are in charge, you will gradually implement reforms to achieve practical results. However, the task is difficult and there is a great need for talent. Just taking agriculture as an example, there are many branches, which can be roughly divided into twenty or thirty categories, such as agronomy, animal husbandry, soil science, entomology, sericulture, economics, and education, etc. Each category requires specialized expertise and is not easily replaced. Moreover, those with specialized expertise must also have the spirit of diligence and perseverance in order to have hope for development. In the industrial administration of various countries, specialized talents must be carefully selected from the beginning. Once they are appointed, they are not changed, which is why specialized expertise is valued. Although I claim to be familiar with agriculture, I have little understanding of it. If I were to take on a heavy burden, I fear that I would fail to live up to expectations. Using my past skills, I can only weave socks. To recruit talents for a while, you need thousands of banners. Moreover, after two years of playing the yu flute in the orchestra, I have not achieved anything. I have asked myself many times and feel very ashamed. I intend to take this opportunity to return to my old business. Instead of delaying the country and making meaningless sacrifices, it would be better to return to my business and repay the kindness of peace and prosperity. Therefore, I am pouring out my heart and conveying my sincere request to you, hoping that you will understand my foolish sincerity and not honor me with the appointment."</p>
<h3>People in Xuzhou Request to Change to Huai Salt</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch – The five counties of Tongshan, Xiaoxian, Fengxian, Pei, and Dang in Xuzhou have repeatedly submitted requests regarding the rejection of Lu salt and the change to Huai salt last year. This year, during the military period, traffic between Xuzhou and Shandong was blocked, Lu salt could not reach Xuzhou, and the people of the five counties felt the risk of eating bland food. The various public organizations in Tongshan submitted a request to the Xuzhou military camp to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to borrow Huai salt for three months to provide relief. Currently, the Lu coast is exhausted, and Lu salt still cannot reach Xuzhou. The public organizations of the five counties all feel that it is necessary to change to Huai salt. Recently, representatives were selected to establish a Five-County Salt Change Movement Committee, and the representative of Tongshan was elected as the Standing Committee member to carry out the change. The association submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "The five counties of Tongshan, Xiaoxian, Fengxian, Pei, and Dang in Xuzhou, in the middle of the Qianlong period, ate Huai salt. In the early years of Guangxu, the Huai Beach was submerged for fifteen years, and the merchant Liu Hongxu independently petitioned the Shandong Governor's Office to return to official management and began to sell Lu salt. Judging from the situation at the time, although Xuhai was not far apart, the postal roads were difficult to transport. Although Xulu was farther apart, the canal boats could reach it by water. Therefore, the people of the five counties felt that it was more convenient to change to Lu salt. After the establishment of the Jinpu and Longhai Railways after the founding of the Republic of China, both Lu salt and Huai salt were transported by train. The Lu coast was far and the Huai coast was near, and Lu transportation was difficult and Huai transportation was easy. Therefore, the price of Lu salt rose daily, and the amount of lead decreased daily. Once transportation was blocked, there was a shortage. Huai salt was cheap, sales were wide, transportation was convenient, and supply was endless. What was called eating Lu for convenience in the past is now still eating Huai for convenience. Therefore, since the founding of the Republic of China, the Lu coast has repeatedly been out of stock, and it has been temporarily replaced by the Huai coast. It is carefully investigated that in the first year of the Republic of China, the revolutionary army arrived in Xuzhou, and the traffic between Xulu was blocked. Chen Qian, the former Huai Army Commander, borrowed Huai salt to sell it in five counties. Until July of the same year, Zhou Ziqi, the former Governor of Shandong, assisted the Huai Army with 8,000 yuan of silver per month, and the Shandong transport envoy dispatched Zhang Jikang to Xuzhou to resume selling Lu salt. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the Allied Forces arrived in Xuzhou, and the traffic between Xulu was blocked again. Chen Yi, the former Commander of Xuzhou, ordered the Gongyu Company to transport and sell Huai salt for a year. Until March of the fifteenth year, the Lu army went south and insisted on restoring the shoreline. The Lu merchant Jinfagong Company sold Lu salt again. Until the sixteenth year, it stopped selling on its own due to excessive losses. The Huai merchants Jimin Company, Ji Company, and Fuhua Company continued to sell Huai salt. In March of the eighteenth year, the Lu merchant Luchang Company came to Xuzhou again to compete for the Lu coast. In February of this year, it closed all its distribution offices and anti-smuggling teams due to losses. In July, the Jin army entered Shandong, and the traffic between Xulu was blocked again. At that time, the Lu coast had been out of stock for a long time, and the people's food supply was in short supply. During the military period, public order was affected, and dangerous situations arose. The Xuzhou legal group submitted a request to the former Xuzhou camp director He Yaozu to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to borrow Huai for three months to provide relief, so that the people's food supply could be maintained without being exhausted. Now that the three-month period has expired, Lu salt has still not arrived in Xuzhou. The exhaustion of the Lu coast has now reached its extreme. According to statistics, in the past nineteen years, the Lu coast has been out of stock five times, three times due to military relations and traffic blockages, and twice due to its own losses and bankruptcies. Without the Huai salt supply, the people would have to eat bland food. Based on this, it is very clear that the five counties of Xuzhou should sell Huai salt instead of Lu salt under the current environment. Even in terms of tax revenue, both Lu coast and Huai coast belong to national tax revenue. Only with convenient transportation and sales can tax revenue be prosperous. The Lu coast has repeatedly been out of stock, and private vendors have taken the opportunity to fill the market. Not only can the people's food not be widely supplied, but the tax revenue is also beneficial to the country's tax revenue. We must unanimously call for the change of shoreline in order to reduce the burden and avoid the risk of eating bland food again. The representatives are entrusted by the people to make an earnest request. We humbly believe that the five counties of Xuzhou have never been a fixed shoreline for Lu salt in terms of history, and it is even more impossible to sell Huai salt in terms of reality. Therefore, we earnestly request that the Ministry of Finance quickly change the shoreline, stop Lu sales, and sell Huai to enable the people of the five counties to reduce their burden and avoid the risk of eating bland food. The national tax revenue can also be expected to be prosperous. We are eagerly awaiting orders."</p>
<h3>Japanese Build Barracks in Tieling</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch – The Japanese garrison is building barracks in Mapenggou, Tieling County, which is extremely important to our country's national defense sovereignty. The Liaoning National Knowledge Promotion Association recently sent personnel to Tieling to conduct an on-site investigation, which has now been completed and returned to Shenyang. According to their report,</p>
<p>Current situation of Japanese military construction: In the highlands north of Mapenggou, about a mile from the surface of the Liao River, the Japanese military has already built more than 20 new barracks, which have not yet been fully completed. In the future, there is definitely a trend of large-scale expansion. Iron wire fences have been erected around the area, covering an area of ​​tens of acres. On the east side of the fence, there are several houses built for the garrison soldiers. There is a signpost in front of the door, with the words "Japanese Army Fortress Headquarters Boundary" written on it.</p>
<p>Japanese wording before construction: Before the construction, the Japanese claimed that it was a place to store military ships. It can be seen that the Japanese policy towards our country has always been to nibble away at it. Today it is a warehouse, tomorrow it is a barracks, and the day after tomorrow it is a fortress. For example, the establishment of various barracks along the South Manchurian Railway and the completion of various fortresses along the Anfeng Line all started with a few warehouses. Moreover, the construction of Mapenggou is larger in scope than other places. Even if the Japanese claim that it is a place to store military ships, military ships are naval combat products and are also a manifestation of aggression.</p>
<p>Japanese tyranny after construction: In July last year, when the Japanese Navy conducted exercises in the Mapenggou area, the sound of artillery was deafening, and military ships drove horizontally, sinking and damaging countless civilian ships. The people were unable to complain and had to swallow their anger. However, the Japanese military's poison has not yet subsided, and they also want to use the highlands of Yangmabao, Ximuchang, Hongya, and Kangjiashan on the opposite side of Mapenggou as a training ground for their marines. They also plan to use the dozens of villages on the opposite bank as their permanent test war zone after the completion of the Mapenggou barracks.</p>
<p>Relationship between Mapenggou and the overall situation in Tieling: Tieling County has been surrounded by the Japanese military. In the southern part of the city, such as the villages of Balizhuang and Liuhegou, there are Japanese barracks, which are divided into two major camps, north and south, with more than 4,000 houses, which can station more than 5,000 troops. In the eastern part of the city, such as Mount Maofeng and Mount Longshou, the Japanese military randomly patrols and practices combat. The nearby residents have suffered countless depredations. In March last year, the Japanese also wanted to raise funds to build Longshou Mountain Road to seize the real power of Longshou Mountain. Fortunately, Huang Jushan, Yu Wenchuan, Hu Jinfan, Deng Zhijie and others worked hard to resist, and it was not successful. Currently, the Japanese ambition has not subsided, and they still want to build a fort on the right side of Longshou Mountain after the completion of the Mapenggou barracks, using the mountain peaks to implement their high-level equipment. It can be seen that this mountain faces Mapenggou from a distance. In the event of an emergency, it can protect its iron bridge in the north, and can control the Chai River. In the west, it can cover the barracks of Mapenggou and block the traffic of the Liao River. In the south, it can protect the Japanese military houses in Balizhuang and other areas. In the western part of the city, there is the Japanese South Manchurian Railway. High-voltage motors are installed along the road. In peacetime, it can manipulate our electrical and economic power. In wartime, this machine can be used to install power grids and electric mines, and even emit toxic gas, etc. The danger is indescribable. In short, Tieling County has fallen into the hands of the Japanese military. The only way out is the corner of Mapenggou. Mapenggou is located in the important passage of the Liao River, with convenient transportation. In the event of an emergency, it can go straight to Liaoyuan in the upper reaches and directly to Yingkou in the lower reaches. If this place is occupied by the Japanese military again, the waterway will be monopolized, the land route will be controlled, and the throat will be strangled and the arm will be touched. Liaoshen will also be threatened (11th).</p>
<h3>Binjiang Prison is Slandered in Negotiations</h3>
<p>Japanese Reporter Fabricates Facts</p>
<p>Contains Malicious Intent</p>
<p>Prison Has Filed Negotiations</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch – Japanese reporter Motohashi of the Domei News Agency published news falsely claiming that on the 30th of last month, a guard at the Binjiang No. 3 Prison brutally beat inmate Wang, causing 60 inmates to go on a hunger strike in solidarity. Shan Zuoshan, the warden of Binjiang No. 3 Prison, believes that the Japanese reporter fabricated facts, which greatly affects the recovery of China's legal rights. He specially invited personnel from the Japanese Consulate in Harbin and reporters from various newspapers to visit the prison today (10th) to prove the existence of the facts. Shan Zuoshan also negotiated with the Japanese Consulate personnel on the spot, making four requests. The Japanese Consulate staff agreed to report to the Consul and planned to reply on the 11th. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Process of slander: Reporter Motohashi of the Domei News Agency is a special correspondent stationed in Harbin by the agency. He specializes in fabricating news that defames Chinese government agencies. On the 5th of this month, he sent a telegram to his headquarters, which was then sent to various branch offices. As a result, many major newspapers around the world published it, because the news is closely related to the return of consular jurisdiction to various countries. The news roughly stated, "The Binjiang No. 3 Prison is cold indoors and has insufficient food. The inmates asked the warden to increase the food supply, which angered the authorities. The leading inmate, Wang, was beaten to death, causing public outrage among the inmates in the same cell. Sixty people have been on a hunger strike in solidarity for five days since the 30th of last month, and are still continuing the hunger strike," etc. After this news was published, Binjiang No. 3 Prison filed negotiations with Motohashi.</p>
<p>Motohashi's remarks: This morning (10th), Wang Jingshun, the section chief of the No. 3 Prison, visited Motohashi at Room 44 of the Barras Hotel in Daoli and asked where the news came from. Motohashi only said that he heard it from someone, and seemed to feel deeply that his fabrication of the news had been seen through, so he did not insist on it very much. He also said that if it was untrue, it could be corrected, but it had to be based on a statement from the prison requesting it before he could send a telegram. Section Chief Wang told him that correction was a matter of course, but it was a very important matter. The prison was now afraid that the outside world would misunderstand his report, so he specially invited him to visit and invited Chinese news reporters to go. Motohashi did not immediately agree. After Wang returned to prison, he sent a letter inviting Motohashi to go on the 10th, but Motohashi still hid and did not go.</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate staff went: Today (10th), dozens of Chinese reporters arrived. Because Motohashi did not go, the prison specially invited the Japanese Consulate to send someone to visit. The Japanese Consulate was initially unwilling, but after persistent invitations, they sent Secretary Kuraoto Hideaki to the prison. Warden Shan Zuoshan led him on a tour of the entire prison. All the inmates were quiet and there was no noise. The indoor temperature was also appropriate, and there was no sign of what was reported in Motohashi's telegram. After the tour, Shan Zuoshan negotiated with Kuraoto, saying that the Binjiang No. 3 Prison was directly under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Administration Yuan. The Japanese reporter deliberately spread rumors, directly insulting the prison, indirectly insulting China, and containing political motives, destroying our country's efforts to recover consular jurisdiction. The Japanese Consulate could not shirk its responsibility for this matter. It was best to settle it through local negotiations and not escalate it into a government diplomatic issue. Kuraoto said that based on what he saw today, there seemed to be no mistreatment of prisoners. He could not prove what had happened before. Motohashi's telegram did not inquire with the prison, and the news was not cautious. It was best to have considerable material to prove that it was definitely not the case, and he could order it to be corrected. Shan said that to prove whether there was anything before, he could randomly select a prisoner for your Secretary to question, or Motohashi could come in person and try to find out the truth. Kuraoto refused. Later, he tried to call Motohashi by phone, but Motohashi still refused to come. The prison made requests: After several hours of negotiations with no results, the prison made four requests: (1) The Japanese Consul in Harbin should formally apologize to the prison. (2) The Domei News Agency should immediately send a telegram to correct the error. (3) The Japanese Consulate must guarantee that there will be no such propaganda in the future. (4) Motohashi, the original sender of the telegram, should be deported. Kuraoto said that Articles 1, 3, and 4 were too far away and could not be discussed. For the correction of the telegram, the prison must find a fact to prove that it was not the case. In the end, Kuraoto agreed to return to the Consulate to report to Consul-General Yagi Motohati and find a reasonable way to discuss with Motohashi, so that the negotiations would not escalate. The Japanese side's opinion was that a reply could be given on the 11th. At about 5 o'clock, Kuraoto left. Recently, the prison, in addition to waiting for the Japanese reply, is also preparing to file a protest and report to the government for instructions on how to deal with it if there is no result (10th).</p>

They jointly submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan and the provincial government, appealing for exemption from the allocation to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<p>Continued Account of the Major Robbery in Jinshanwei: Jinshanwei is located on the coast, and the market town is desolate. The Tongxing Oil Company's business scope is relatively developed, making it a target for bandits. In the past, the Fourth Anti-Smuggling Brigade and the county police force provided strict defense, preventing robberies. This time, a large gang combined forces and stationed two patrol boats belonging to the Fourth Squad of the old Salt Transportation Canal. Caught off guard, the bandits struck first, killing one patrolman and seizing seven guns. After reporting to the brigade headquarters, Brigade Commander Pan, along with District Chief Xu Chuzhang of the Sixteenth District, went to the countryside to investigate and comfort the robbed families, promising to pursue the bandits. After receiving the report, the county court prosecutor, accompanied by court clerks and investigators, hired a boat and arrived in Jinshan on the seventeenth to investigate.</p>

Recently, the bandits in Tong'an Bridge dared to rob weapons, injure police, and kidnap a large number of hostages, fleeing to Zhejiang Province. They specially met in Suzhou the other day and decided that the two district chiefs, Mao and Shen, would jointly telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Water Police to implement a joint suppression to expand the bandit suppression plan, so as to avoid the problem of suppressing them here and having them flee there. The team leaders Li Jianzhu of the Seventh Team and Wang Wusheng of the Eighth Team of the Second District led their teams to Taihu Lake to search. District Chief Mao, because of the rampant bandits in the Yuko area of Binhu in Wujin, discussed a siege method with District Chief Zhang of the Fourth District and decided that the Second District would be responsible for sending teams to encircle and suppress the bandits. The Fourth District would send warships to assist.</p>
<p>Scheduled Levy of Banquet Donations: The County Education Bureau, in order to increase education funds, intends to organize banquet donations, drafting collection regulations and submitting them to the Education and Finance Departments for approval. Because the restaurant industry has been declining in recent years and business is sluggish, it has repeatedly appealed to the Provincial Department and the Executive Yuan to revoke the levy, but to no avail. Recently, Xu Shifa paid 2,000 yuan to contract with the Finance Bureau, first paying two months of contracted money, a total of 4,000 yuan, which has been approved by the Finance Bureau. Xu Shifa was appointed as the micro-collection director and is scheduled to start collecting on January 1st of next year.</p>
<p>County Prison Plans to Establish a Drug Rehabilitation Center for Criminals: Pan Zhongjia, the magistrate of the county, because there are many opium addicts detained in the county prison, is deeply concerned that if methods are not found to break their addiction, there will be no practical benefit.

The required funding is tentatively set at 200 yuan per month and will be used from the monthly opium case fines, reserved under the item of funds for prohibiting opium. Yesterday, he submitted a report to Lin, the president of the Higher Court, requesting instructions.</p>

After negotiations, the matter was settled for 500 yuan. It is requested that Pu A'gen be summoned for interrogation to maintain the opium prohibition and uphold the law. After receiving the letter, Wang Weizu immediately sent police officers to arrest him. They arrested the suspect, Pu A'gen, in Dongxia Village, Duqi Town, and brought him to the bureau for questioning. Pu's confession was cunning, and he firmly denied the circumstances of robbing red pills and mediating the distribution of stolen foreign goods.

Officer Liu, because of the limited police force, telegraphed the Third Police Station of the Dabeimen and the wood-clad team of the Public Security Bureau for assistance. When the police arrived near Zong's house, they fired warning shots. The bandits returned fire while collecting the loot and fleeing. Police teams and military police regiments from the city also rushed to the scene. When the bandits fled to the vicinity of the railway, they encountered team police from the Third Police Station. The two sides exchanged fire, lasting for more than twenty minutes. Because it was late at night, the police team did not dare to pursue them. Afterwards, the three families checked their losses, which totaled about 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Provincial Order to Raise Funds for the Canal: Within the originally set 300,000 yuan budget for the Wu County canal dredging project, 75,000 yuan was previously borrowed by the Provincial Government.

It is heard that there has been some progress and that at least 500,000 or more of short-term loans can be borrowed for embellishment. However, the details of the collateral have not yet been explored.</p>

<p>The Truth About the Mutiny in Hanzhou, Sichuan: In recent years, the political situation in Sichuan has failed to unify. The Communist Party has taken advantage of this opportunity to organize branches in various places and actively carry out activities, especially in the counties west of Sichuan. They usually lurk in the armies, secretly spreading sedition. Hanzhou is not far from the province, and its terrain is dangerous. The Communist Party considers it the most suitable area for activities. On October 25th, they supported one or two company and platoon leaders in the local army to launch an uprising. However, because the plan was not well-made, they fled in all directions on the second day after the uprising. The comedy performed by the Chinese Communist Party is nothing more than this. However, there is no disturbance in the local area. Fortunately, the garrison troops are very powerful in suppressing them, and they were able to avoid disaster. Now, the local order has returned to normal.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<h3>Letter from Lawyers Xu Shihao and Dai Jinghuai</h3>
<p>Regarding your esteemed newspaper's foreign news column on the 16th of this month, which reported on the Guo Daming divorce case appeal, much of the content therein is untrue. Upon investigation, Jiang Ruiying was originally a prostitute named Hua Kui in the Guiyu Troupe of Yong'anli, Heilongjiang. She admitted this herself during the first instance trial, as recorded in the transcript. Guo Daming had a relationship with her for many years, but there was no marriage. How could she attain the status of a wife? The claim of marriage at the Yongchunlou tavern in Heilongjiang is entirely fabricated. Last summer, both parties agreed to dissolve their relationship. By September 6th, a complete agreement was reached, witnessed by lawyer Qiu Fenling and others, and a contract was drawn up to sever the relationship. Unexpectedly, Jiang Ruiying had ulterior motives and forged a one-sided document, falsely claiming that the previously agreed-upon contract was not genuine. This document was not presented during the initial lawsuit but suddenly appeared during the third hearing as the trial was nearing conclusion. The second instance court has repeatedly authenticated the document and found it to be forged based on various investigations. A fair judgment will be rendered soon. As for the claim that Guo paid 50,000 yuan in alimony during the first instance as a condition of settlement, that is also completely unfounded. Therefore, based on the instructions of our client, Guo Daming, we have prepared this letter to request a correction. We hope you will publish it accordingly.</p>

<h3>The Second Day of the Jiangsu Experimental Elementary School Joint Conference</h3>
<p>Continued Report from the First Day</p>
<p>The Elementary School Curriculum Research Group reported that of the three schools responsible for elementary school curriculum research, in addition to the Tai Experimental Elementary School, which has already reported, there are also our school (Wuxi Experimental Elementary School) and Nanjing Experimental Elementary School. Our school's work in this group can be divided into three types: 1. Our school recently plans to engage in the trial compilation of the design and organization of the elementary school curriculum and is currently collecting various design materials. 2. The compilation of life-centered teaching materials throughout the year. Our school has already published a book entitled "Outline of Life-Centered Teaching Materials for Elementary Schools." 3. Party doctrine teaching materials and practical natural science teaching materials. Our school has compiled more than ten types, which are displayed at the meeting place for your guidance. Next, the Nanjing Experimental Elementary School reported that our school's research, compilation, and design of the elementary school curriculum includes the "Experimental Report on Lower-Grade Curriculum under Cooperative Education" and the "Kindergarten Curriculum Report under Cooperative Education," which are displayed at the meeting place. The life-centered materials for each month of the lower grades of elementary school have been included in the "Experimental Report on Lower-Grade Curriculum under Cooperative Education" and are currently on display at the meeting place. In terms of party doctrine, the Central Party Department's party doctrine curriculum standards will be promulgated soon, and this work will be based on that. It is not convenient to edit at will at present. In terms of natural science, our school's self-compiled discovery-style natural science teaching materials under empiricism have been displayed at the meeting place. The number of materials collected from various schools is very small, so it is easy to collect and study them. 9. Children's Life Guidance Group Report Class (The three schools responsible for this group, Tai Experimental Elementary School, Suzhou Women's Experimental Elementary School, and Nanjing Women's Experimental Elementary School, jointly recommended Nanjing Women's Experimental Elementary School to report (reported separately)) 10. Report of the Middle School and Elementary School Connection Research Group (The problem of connection between middle school and elementary school, according to various reports from various schools in the past, seems to be no connection, but the fact is still a problem, so we made a small statistic of the number of elementary school graduates in our province, the number of people applying for middle school, and the number of school places in each middle school. The result seems to be not a research problem, but an administrative problem. Unfortunately, there is too little help from various parties, or it is not very reliable.) 8. Discussed how to classify and discuss more than 100 proposals from various schools during the two-day conference period in order to save time. It was decided that the chairman would appoint nine schools as examiners to examine all proposals of the same nature and merge them for discussion.

<h3>The Underlying Causes of the Guanghua University Incident</h3>
<p>Talk by a Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>(National News Agency) The Guanghua University incident and the early vacation situation have been reported in various newspapers. A reporter from the National News Agency visited the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday to inquire about the truth, as the declaration of the school's faculty and staff, as previously reported, involved the Party Headquarters. The conversation at the time is recorded as follows (the following is the language of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters): "The Guanghua University incident has both immediate and underlying causes. The basketball game incident and the resulting fights are only immediate causes, stemming from the school authorities' mishandling of the situation. The underlying cause, however, is that the school is actually a concentrated bastion of reactionary elements. Liao Shicheng was originally a running dog of Guo Bingwen, a warlord from Southeast University. He flattered the warlord Sun Chuanfang. When the Premier was ill in Beiping, he shouted slogans at Southeast University to overthrow Party-led education and secretly reported to the warlord, falsely accusing Party comrades of being communists and killing them. When the revolutionary army was fighting hard in Hubei and Jiangxi, he called himself a nationalist and held an alliance in the school to support the Five-Color Flag, shouting for Sun Chuanfang. After serving as the president and vice president of Guanghua University, he recruited nationalist reactionary elements such as Luo Longji to serve as faculty, instigating the students. Luo Longji wrote articles in the Crescent Moon magazine, only to destroy the Party's ideology and policies, insult the Premier, and advocate the overthrow of the National Government, all of which are well-documented. He was previously arrested by the Public Security Bureau at China Public School, and Zhang Shouyong, the president of Guanghua University, asked someone to bail him out. However, Luo continued to gather students, promote individual freedom, hoping to instigate student unrest and eliminate the Party comrades among the school's students to achieve his goal of creating a complete reactionary reserve army. It has been found that the school has not held Premier's Memorial Week since last year, nor does it have party ideology courses. The school rules specifically state 'Unity of knowledge and action,' which is obviously deliberately contrary to the Premier's theory of 'Knowledge is easy, action is difficult.' All of this shows that their occupation of the territory and their reactionary activities are obvious to everyone. It is well known that the majority of the school's teachers must be well aware of the righteousness, but with a few scoundrels drumming up trouble, how can student unrest not occur? The president is also concurrently the Vice Minister of Finance and does not often inquire about school affairs, resulting in accumulated problems that are difficult to reverse and leading to this phenomenon. The Central Training Department had already issued instructions for this Association to correct it, but the school turned a deaf ear. It should be known that these professors are daily instilling students with the theory of individual freedom and natural human rights, leading to inappropriate or even reactionary actions, such as distributing reactionary leaflets of all kinds of nationalist and communist parties and posting slogans such as 'Down with the National Government' and 'Down with Chiang Kai-shek' in the school. In response to the incident of fighting over the basketball game, the school has been promoting individual freedom, and the reactionary faculty and staff, in a joint declaration, used the Executive Yuan's order as an excuse to forcibly expel Yang Yangchun, a Party comrade who had nothing to do with the anti-Liao movement. These people usually advocate student freedom, but once it involves themselves, they add the crime of students interfering in school affairs. May I ask, it is wrong to punish those who have not been taught, and if they are taught and punished, how can people be convinced? Now, the matter of whether it is appropriate to expel individuals from school is a small matter, but the fact that reactionary elements are entrenched in schools and instigating young people is a major matter. We must know that the Executive Yuan's order to rectify student unrest should be viewed from two aspects: on the one hand, students are not allowed to interfere in school administration; on the other hand, faculty and staff should be carefully screened to set an example. The government has already begun to rectify national and provincial schools, and the government is also paying close attention to private universities and will never allow reactionary elements to borrow political orders, misinterpret them out of context, and achieve their conspiracy to incite students to create a reactionary force. The presidents of all private schools should also bear the responsibility of screening faculty and staff for the government, society, and student parents. This is not limited to Guanghua University alone."</p>
<p>Jinan University School of Business</p>
<p>Farewell Banquet for Graduating Students During Winter Vacation</p>
<p>The Teachers Give Earnest Speeches</p>
<p>The graduating students of the 1931 class of the School of Business of National Jinan University held a public banquet at the Great East Restaurant yesterday afternoon to bid farewell to their teachers and friends and express their sincere reluctance to part. After taking their seats, Chairman Feng Yongqing delivered a speech expressing his gratitude to the teachers for their years of training, which led to today's achievements, and hoping for continued guidance in the future. Mr. Cai Zhengya spoke on behalf of Principal Zheng about the historical, political, and economic relations between China and Southeast Asia, hoping that after graduation, students would research whatever profession they entered, regardless of their position, and should view science as simple to apply, not as a profound explanation, which is nothing more than (1) collecting data, (2) systematically organizing, (3) objectively observing, and (4) analyzing conclusions. If you continue to study based on this, it will be of great benefit to individuals and of great contribution to the country, and will have a great relationship with Principal Zheng's advocacy of learning. Next, Dean Yang Rumei of the School said that the society's recognition of Jinan University began after the reorganization. It relied on Meng Jin internally, but also on the efforts of graduates externally, so he hoped that the students would (1) carry forward the spirit of Jinan University, (2) transform the excellent scientific life of the school into social life, (3) transform what they learned in textbooks from abstract to concrete, and build experience from theory, and (4) continue the spirit of mutual research between teachers and students. Next, Fan Youshan, the director of the secretariat, Ye Chunquan, the former director of the school, and professors and lecturers Shi Ziyu, Zhou Zhensheng, and Shi Bojie successively gave speeches, and the students also gave speeches. The banquet ended with cheers. The graduates this time were Feng Yongqing, Wang Yanhao, Ma Yongchi, Feng Ruiyun, Qin Yilai, Xu Fucang, Chen Peiyu, Zheng Rong, Yao Xuecheng, Zhang Quanlin, Guo Shengzun, Cai Shiying, and Xu Linshan, totaling thirteen people, all of whom have specialized knowledge, and various agencies have sent letters to recruit them.</p>
<h3>Record of the General Assembly of the Shanghai Journalism Society</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Journalism Society held a general membership meeting at the Dengtuomo Hotel last Sunday. Due to the development of the society's affairs, the original regulations could not include everything, so they have been added and revised.

<p>Because Football Stars Could Not Leave Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai team for the inter-port football match once had the idea of gathering local stars and good players from the army to go to Tianjin. The initial deadline was November 10, but the results were disappointing. Two weeks ago, another solicitation was made, and some progress was made. Seven local stars were obtained, and the selection committee selected six people. The rest were selected from the army. Travel procedures were all prepared. However, a sudden change occurred on Tuesday of this week. The six local players who were selected all resigned to the association. The association was in a dilemma. Considering the importance of friendship and loyalty, it could not send only players from the army as representatives, so it resolutely cancelled the trip to Tianjin.</p>

<h3>Soccer and Basketball Teams Off to the Philippines</h3>
<p>Departing on January 6th to Bring Glory to the Nation</p>
<p>Requesting Instructions from the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation</p>
<p>Filipino Overseas Students to Host a Dance Party for Welcome</p>
<p>The National Jinan University soccer team's trip to the Philippine Islands during the New Year has been met with widespread celebration. It is reported that Senior Zheng of the university telegraphed the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation to request instructions. The message stated: "Our university has received a formal invitation from the Philippine Athletic Association, representing the Philippine government, for our soccer team to participate in charity events and carnival competitions in the Philippines in January of the 20th year of the Republic. This marks the first time that a single university soccer team from our country has been formally invited to compete by a foreign government, which we consider a great honor. In addition to formally replying to the association with a letter of gratitude and acceptance from our university's Department of Physical Education, we have also scheduled the departure for the Philippines on January 6th next year. The team will be led by Mr. Chen Zhang'e, Director of the Department of Physical Education, and Mr. Wu Yanzhang, guiding student players Liang Guocai, Dai Linjing, Liang Guanlian, Feng Yunyou, Jiang Shanjing, Chen Zhenhe, Zhuang Shihong, Liang Shutang, Chen Jiaqiu, Fu Hexuan, Chen Bingxiang, Mei Hongbao, Lin Songfa, Luo Haiguang, Tong Rongwen, Xie Quanhe, and Yang Baoyan, totaling nineteen people including teachers and students. They will travel to the Philippines on the Japanese Empress steamer for the competition, which is an international athletic event and related to the honor of our nation. Therefore, we have specially copied the contract and urgent telegram sent by the association and formally request your federation's approval and instructions in accordance with the regulations, so that we may have guidance to follow and enhance the nation's reputation. Furthermore, Director Chen Zhang'e has been studying physical education in the Philippines for many years and is extremely familiar with the local conditions. We are confident that he will be able to perform his duties happily and successfully as the team leader. Respectfully submitted, Zheng Hongnian, President of National Jinan University." Furthermore, the university's basketball team will also be traveling at the same time. The Philippine Chinese Student Association of the university has resolved to hold a dance party at the Dahua Hotel dance hall on Gordon Road from 4:00 PM to 8:30 PM on the 22nd of this month (Monday) to bid farewell to the Jinan soccer and basketball teams heading to the Philippines. A panel committee has been organized, with Li Qinghua in charge of general affairs, Ye Weide in charge of accounting, Yang Wencheng in charge of documentation, Zhu Ziying in charge of public relations, and Chen Kangguo as an officer.

<h3>Referees Must Submit Referee Reports</h3>
<p>The honorary secretary of the Western Football Club declares that recently, referees have been delaying the submission of result reports by eight to ten days, or even failing to submit them at all. It should be known that these reports are the only evidence the club has to make an official model for the most recent team results. All referees must take this matter seriously to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<h3>A Smile from a Traveling Merchant</h3>
<p>Housewife (to servant): Here's a dollar. Go buy me thirty eggs. Be careful on the road. You'll have to pay if you break them.</p>
<p>Servant: I know, I know. I certainly won't break them. (Takes the money and leaves hurriedly.) Housewife (sees the servant return with a chicken half an hour later): What does this mean? I told you to buy eggs. Why did you buy a chicken?</p>
<p>Servant: Madam, the streets are very slippery today. If I bought eggs, I was afraid I'd fall and smash them. So it's safer to buy a chicken. Luckily, you want eggs. Let it lay them slowly.</p>
<p>Housewife: Bah! Damn it! You bought a rooster! It can't lay eggs!</p>
<p>A (sees his two friends fighting): Hey! You're old friends. Why be so impolite? Talk it out.</p>
<p>B (stops fighting): We're doing it all for you.</p>
<p>C: Yes, we're doing it all for you.</p>
<p>A: Huh? That's strange. You're fighting. How is it for me?</p>
<p>B: I said you're a first-class villain. He said "first-class" is too much. You can only say "second-class." We couldn't agree, so we started fighting.</p>
<p>Sheriff (to policeman): When you arrested this prisoner, how was his attitude towards you?</p>
<p>Policeman: Very impolite. He only took out a dollar. How could I accept that? So I arrested him and brought him here.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui Flies to Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Since the accident of the "Shanghai" airplane, with the injuries of the two important figures, Xiong and Yang, society has been talking about airplanes as if they were tigers. In fact, it is all unnecessary worry. Mr. Wu Zhihui, in view of this, specially took a plane to Jiangxi upon being summoned by Chairman Chiang, in order to break the unnecessary worries. On the eve of boarding the plane on the 12th, he said to his friend: "The "Shanghai" fell to the ground, a small accident, how can it be a concern? Compared with the great tragedy of the British plane some days ago, this is really not worth mentioning. I decided to fly to Jiangxi to advocate it. Two thousand miles from here, it can be reached in half a day. The Tang people's poem said that 'a thousand miles to Jiangling can be returned in a day,' compared to this, it is really a small witch seeing a big witch." His words were bold, and those who stopped eating because they choked should have no worries. Unexpectedly, after Wu boarded the plane in Shanghai at 8 o'clock on the 12th, he encountered fog shortly after the flight and descended. The next day, newspapers reported that it landed in the river near Zhenjiang. The English ship pulled it to Zhenjiang. Passengers and mail all landed and went away. The machine had to return to Shanghai after repair. Those who heard it were worried about Wu. According to visitors from Jiangyin yesterday, the machine actually landed on the Jiangyin North Gate outside of Huangtiangang River surface. Safely descended with the fog. Nothing was injured. At that time, the residents of the port gathered like a wall. After about half an hour, the machine still flapped its wings and flew west. The audience cheered and sent off. According to this, Wu's flight to Jiangxi was still safely went away. Those who care about Wu do not have to be surprised. And Wu's two thousand miles grand tour is still faster than a thousand miles to Jiangling return in a day.</p>
<h3>Welcoming Mr. Chu Minyi's Return to China, Recorded by Sheng Tangbihua</h3>
<p>Mr. Chu Minyi, the chief representative of the National Government to the Centennial Exposition in Belgium, returned to China on the afternoon of the 13th (the day before yesterday) at 6 o'clock on the Japanese mail ship "Chunyang Maru" with his secretary, Mr. Zhou Shida. The situation has been recorded in various newspapers. There were many things seen and heard that day. I will record it in detail as follows.</p>
<p>A month ago, Mr. Shao Ruxin and other fellow villagers of Huzhou in Shanghai received a telegram from Chu, saying that he would return to China on the 13th of this month, and learned that he had achieved outstanding results in Belgium, ranking among the best. Mr. Shao and others immediately opened a preparatory welcome meeting at the Atlantic Western Restaurant. I also participated in it. Everyone elected Mr. Shao as the director of the preparation. On the morning of the 13th.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Candy Exhibition by Modern Old Man</h3>
<p>On Sunday, I went to the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to visit the candy exhibition of Guanshengyuan. The guests were very crowded that day. The exhibits can be divided into two major parts. One shows the order of sugar making, and the other shows the use of sugar. The order of sugar making makes people want to drool. And the use of sugar is made into eight small stages. The scenery and characters are very realistic. The host with the face of good fortune, Xi Guansheng, cordially greets and squeezed around among the guests. The big guy feels quite inconvenient. There are many interesting words from the guests. Xu Zhuodai wrote the three words "Ding Guagua", which is the transliteration of Tan Pu Yuan, who was recommended by Tianlu. It is said that the number of visitors in two days reached more than 30,000.</p>
<p>I went to visit Shao Jun in the preparation meeting in Pingle Lane, Second Malu. Many people from all walks of life went to join the welcome. At 1:00 pm, I first took a colorfully decorated car with Mr. Wu Tianni and others to the Huangpu Wharf to take care of everything. When I arrived at the wharf, I saw the archways and lanterns, arranged in an orderly manner. They were made by the Star Film Company. It read "Welcome Mr. Chu Minyi's Return to China". Next to it was a couplet that said, "Bo Wang's reputation remains in the remote areas. Shen Gao's prosperity shakes the world." It was magnificent and very grand. There were also dozens of colorful silk flags hanging, embroidered with the words "Welcome Mr. Chu Minyi's Return to China as a Representative of the National Government". It felt particularly pleasing to the eye. Because it was still early, and the cold wind in the Huangpu River was piercing, there was no place to rest. So Mr. Wu initiated and accompanied the gentlemen to a tea shop for a drink. At about three o'clock, we arrived at the wharf. The welcomers had arrived one after another. About a thousand people were standing at the wharf, looking at the incoming ship.</p>
<p>Mr. Shao Ruxin was running around and greeting, and was very busy. He also distributed cakes to the guests, and called out to everyone to be careful of the incoming ship. At that time, a black giant ship came crashing through the waves. Shao immediately shouted "Here it comes..." Then the military music was melodious and the explosions were loud, and there were also applause. As the ship approached, we realized it was a misunderstanding. It turned out to be a company ship from Hong Kong. This was also an interesting anecdote during the welcome.</p>
<p>Mr. Chu's father, Mr. Xingtan, was already eighty years old, with a white beard and eyebrows, but he was very energetic. It was really rare. At about four o'clock, he also came to the wharf. His family helped him sit inside the railing. Someone asked him if he was too tired at such a young age. He replied, "I'm just here to see the excitement." He asked everyone he met, "Has the ship arrived yet?" He was leaning on the railing, looking forward. I don't know how happy he was in his heart to see this grand occasion.</p>
<p>The Star Film Company, in view of the grand occasion of Mr. Chu's return to China this time, specially sent Mr. Dong Tianya, Cheng Bugao, and Zheng Xiaoqiu with moving cameras and electric candles to take pictures. At that time, the dusk was dim and the light was dark. I approached Mr. Dong and Cheng and said, "Why not take advantage of this free time to make a film for Mr. Chu's father as a souvenir?" The two gentlemen agreed with me very much. So Mr. Shao Ruxin introduced it to Mr. Chu's father. The old gentleman nodded in agreement. So Xiaoqiu held the candle and Bugao directed. Mr. Chu's father smiled and a good picture was taken in the machine.</p>
<p>After the filming, everyone shouted, "Here it comes, here it comes!" People were crowded, looking forward. Some held telescopes, and some held cameras. But seeing the black smoke lingering, a giant ship gradually approached. Then the military music played in unison, and the meteors were released. The five colors were colorful. The firecrackers rose high, and the sound shook the Huangpu River. Mr. Chu stood on the wheel, waving the national flag to express his gratitude. I then initiated Mr. Shao to shout the slogans "Welcome Mr. Chu Minyi's Victory in Belgium," "Long Live the Republic of China," "Long Live Mr. Chu Minyi!" A certain gentleman led the way, and a hundred people echoed, took off their hats and waved their towels. The scene was very enthusiastic. Mr. Chu's daughter, who was only seven years old, also shouted "Uncle" in the midst of the crowd. When the wheel approached the wharf, it pushed ten representatives to board the wheel to welcome him. Later, because it was difficult for many people to get through the crowd and get on. I followed Mr. Wu Tianni, Liu Daofang, and others on the wheel and shook hands with Mr. Chu. Mr. Chu was wearing a white-grey suit, with a radiant look and a kind smile. When getting off the wheel, the star company filmed them one by one. Mr. Chu and his wife</p>
<h3>Travel Notes of Nanyang (103) Spirit Flower</h3>
<p>On the 14th, I returned from Na Mao to Burma’s capital (Mandalay). I got on the train at 7 am. The porters here, mostly Chinese, often smoke opium. If they are late, they will miss the train. Some say that they even collude with the inns to deliberately delay the guests from boarding the train, so that they can retain the guests for one more night. Near the station near Na Mao, there is a famous waterfall. Its English name is Manfalls. It is a pity that I could not get off the car to see it in detail. The scenery along the way in northern Burma is very good. There are many waterfalls, and this one is the largest. When I went north from Mandalay (that is, Burma’s capital), people generally told me that I should pay attention to getting sick when going north during the rainy season. I didn't think so at the time. But here, I had a sore throat and became hoarse. It took three days to recover in Mandalay. This is because of catching a cold. Many small towns are passed along the way. There are Chinese people everywhere. It is estimated that there are one or two hundred thousand Chinese in the whole of Burma, spread across various villages. Most of them marry Burmese women. Most of the overseas Chinese students are produced by Burmese mothers. I have an impression here. China claims to be a cultural nation, but it fails when it encounters Burmaization. There are two characteristics of Burmaization: one is Buddhism and the other is feminization. All Chinese people who marry Burmese women will have their language and culture Burmaized after one generation. However, Chinese people who marry Chinese women must have more than one or two thousand yuan of property. And marriage with Burmese people is free, which is more than that of Chinese people.</p>
<p>The shortcomings of the Chinese people are exposed everywhere. There is a lack of self-government. There are also many people who are engaged in improper industries. For example, the white pills made by Japan in Tianjin are popular in Shanxi. It contains morphine and is used instead of opium. Because the people of North China hate the Japanese very much, the British sold opium to us. I criticized the savagery of the British in textbooks and newspapers. However, the overseas Chinese in Burma who are engaged in the white medicine industry often do so. Baiyao is a kind of anesthetic. It is said that it was originally made in Australia, but the Chinese trafficked it. It is also a morphine-like substance. It is a harmful thing to the Burmese people. Also, the amount of opium imported from Yunnan to the south is not small. Someone on the way showed me that a certain gentleman was still penniless this spring. In the past few months, he has made a fortune. It is because of the trafficking of opium. This kind of person is also despised by society. But once the money is in hand, it will naturally have power and not be afraid of being despised.</p>
<p>And family members, etc., were all filmed to keep a record. Then they took their cars and dispersed. At that time, the bell was already ringing seven times.</p>
<h3>Mr. Yu Tiansui's Funeral Oration by Zheng Yimei</h3>
<p>It has been half a year since Mr. Yu Tiansui, a lyricist of the Southern Society, passed away. I went to the Gongdelin on Parker Road yesterday to pay my respects. Looking at the remaining image, Qingqi and Weizi made people recall the appearance of sitting knees in the apartment and discussing with the Yin Yin. It is like being in front of you, and you will be moved to tears. The elegiac couplets on the four walls are mostly from the hands of the Southern Society Tongwen, all mournful and timeless, and enduring to be sung. Such as Hu Jichen said, "Fusheng Ruomeng Jun Xianjiao, Shishi Ruoqi I Duguang." Hu Pu'an said, "His remarks were agitated, and he had a strange talent to ask the world. His poems were vast, and he ended his life in newspapers and schools." Ye Chuwei said, "In addition to gold, stone, calligraphy and painting, he is also proficient in Qihuang, but he cannot cure poverty and disease. In the midst of the words of war, he occasionally spent the day and night together, and then he finished his life." Liu Yazi said, "The world has changed and has been alarmed. I know that you are still looking at it after you die. The sound of the piano has become a silence. Alas, what can I bear to live again?" Zhu Shaoping said, "The white horse and the plain car worry about entering the dream. The blue sky and the blue sea regret the calling of the soul." There are many other joint ventures that cannot be fully recorded. Mr. Ping Sheng has many works, but he is a famous scholar and does not cherish it. He will give up whatever he makes. There is no manuscript. The main magazines and newspapers in Shanghai often take them and publish them on their behalf, which is even more scattered and uncollectible. Mr. Zhezi Yuan Genjun, recently studying at Chengzhong Middle School in Hongkou, is very worried about the loss of his father's articles. Discuss with Yu Yu to collect one. In order to print it into a collection, in addition to recording one-tenth of it, there are many missing things. Mr. has a wide range of friends, most of them in the shilin, and has been teaching for many years. Taoli is all over the world. If you have Mr.'s prefaces, miscellaneous works, and poems, please send them to Zheng Yimei, Shanghai Film Company, Tiantong'an Road, Zhabei, Shanghai. So that Mr.'s special collection can be published as soon as possible, then both survival and death are moved, and I am fortunate to be a student of Mr., and the responsibility lies in what I hope for.</p>
<p>Short News: The countries of civilized evolution are all beautiful. All colors, sounds, fragrances, and all kinds of literature and art, all seek their perfection. But looking at modern times, there are those who don't. Those who like beauty like to be charming, and those who like sound like Zheng Wei. I don't know that there is a proper color and a proper sound in the world. What is the proper color? The appearance of Guan Sui Youdiao. What is the proper sound? The right of five tones and six laws. Those who do not know the right color are not enough to be wise, and those who do not know the right sound are not enough to be smart. People all say that I am wise, but they cannot distinguish between positive sound and positive color. How can you be smart? Only the ancient qin can do all the five tones and six rhythms in Yiyue. The ancient qin is one of the highest arts. It is recognized by the ancient and modern world. Today, a semi-deaf layman has set up a society to study the ancient qin and preserve the national art. Anyone who likes elegant music should not miss this good opportunity. The club is located in Chongfa Temple, Guling Road. (Elaborately)</p>
<p>Know the news: Zhu Jingqing and Yin Yiqiu have recently created more than 100 steel wire aircraft, which will be distributed by the Chinese Toy Manufacturing Factory. It is named Wandong. Each aircraft is 24 inches long. The style is new and beautiful, and it is no different from a manned aircraft. And it is strong and durable. The power can fly tens of feet. It not only adds glory to the national goods industry, but also opens a new record in the toy industry of various countries. It is said that the ordering office is at Xinmin Fine Arts and Industrial Society, Menghua Street, Ximen.</p>
<h3>The Warmth in My Heart (3)(3)(7) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Diligently Asking for Words, Cui Xiu Meets the Teacher, Generously Talking About Soldiers, Green Tower Banquet Female Hero</p>
<p>Luyi has the temperament of a little girl. She installed a telephone for the first time, which was full of her curiosity. How could such a weird thing communicate with people so far away? And the telephone, although it was shared by four families in one house, was installed at the top of the escalator. Taking a step out of her pavilion room was as convenient as it could get. When she saw the telephone, she wanted to try calling it. However, there were not many telephones on the other side. There was only the telephone in Zuoshi Chenbao Hall. When she didn't have a telephone installed in her house, she had already memorized it when she borrowed telephones from other people's houses. A few Roman characters written in pencil on a small piece of white paper, folded and hidden in the small drawer of the dressing table. At this moment, she tried to make a phone call out of curiosity. There was no place to call, so she called Zuoshi Chen's newspaper office. The telephone in the editorial department of the newspaper office happened to be installed next to the table where Zuoshi Chen was sitting. In fact, Luyi's initial call was entirely out of curiosity. Since the phone was connected, she had to say a few words. Zuoshi Chen answered the phone and asked what was the matter. But he heard a giggle from the phone. After the laughter stopped, he said. Are you coming later? Zuoshi Chen said. Teach me to come. What's the matter? Luyi said. If you come, you will naturally know. Mom has something to tell you. You have to come. I'm hanging up. At that time, Zuoshi Chen thought that there was something really wrong. His mother really had something to say. He quickly finished the affairs in the newspaper office and went to Xiaohuayuan. Sometimes Luyi went out to sing in the hall. Her middle-aged mother, holding a water pipe, was leaning on the sofa chair in a daze. Seeing Zuoshi Chen going, she was naturally full of excuses, saying that Anan had gone to sing in the hall. She will be back soon. Why didn't you come yesterday, etc. She also said. If you don't come again, she said she would call you. Zuoshi Chen said. Huh, didn't she just call me? She taught me to come, and said you have something to tell me. Luyi's mother said. Oh, I haven't been out of the small house for more than a moment. Maybe she has something to say to your second young master. Maybe she didn't tell me. Zuoshi Chen smiled. Then she falsely preached the imperial decree. Her mother said. Maybe she has something to tell you, but she pushed it on me. Wait a moment and ask her when she comes back. After a while, Luyi came back. Zuoshi Chen said. You cheated me. You said your mother had something to say to me. Now ask her. She doesn't know anything. Luyi covered her mouth and smiled and said that if she didn't say that to you on the phone, you wouldn't come. To be honest, I'm just making a call to play. You ask me what's wrong. I just have to say teach you to come. What does mom have to say? That's to trick you. Zuoshi Chen said. So you are just having fun. I hurriedly finished my work. I hurried. Luyi's mother joined in the fun and said. Originally, she said several times that she wanted to call you and ask you to come.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial and Gold Market Rapidly Advancing</h3>
<p>Morning View Bullish</p>
<p>Gold Speculation Likely to Continue High</p>
<p>Continues to Show New Record of 58.8 Taels Yesterday's gold speculation trend was high and exuberant, again setting an unprecedented new record, almost reaching 659 taels. However, market conditions were extremely chaotic, changing rapidly, with fluctuations of several taels at every turn. The fierceness of the storms caused immense alarm. The morning session saw a price difference of seven taels, and buying and selling among various firms were chaotic and complex. Firms like Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yongheng, and Yongfeng generally saw demand exceeding supply, while Zhifengyong, Taikangrun, and Yuansheng were all sellers. As for the overseas silver market, it plummeted drastically. However, there were telegraphs from the United States supporting the market, so the gold price opened slightly higher and did not advance rapidly. Subsequently, because sellers seemed strong, it immediately depreciated by five taels, to between 50 and 51 taels. Afterward, foreign exchange quotes contracted by one and a half notches, and market conditions were rather tight. Thus, the gold price advanced rapidly, briefly exceeding 58 taels. However, people's minds were exceptionally uneasy, and the market price was permeated with an indescribable atmosphere. There was strong consolidation, and the later market also saw twists and turns of more than four taels. However, the volume of transactions was not large, and prices hovered between 55 taels and beyond 58 taels. At one point, a new high peak of 58 taels and eight mace was reached. However, since it was Wednesday and the foreign exchange market was closed, the main price in the morning may rise again. If it rises slightly, the gold market may not be moved, and may even have the ability to rise against the trend.</p>
<p>Abrupt Ups and Downs with Strong Consolidation The morning February gold speculation opened at 55 taels and five mace, an increase of three taels and two mace. (The gross price fluctuated from 57 taels to within 5 taels, then above 5 taels, and transactions were not frequent among firms.) The main price plummeted by three-quarters, and the silver price actually dropped by 1.25 points. Private telegraphs also dropped by 1.3125 points. However, the underlying support was stable, in fact because the decline had been too severe, and there was fear of changes. Subsequently, it continued to increase by several mace, to 6 taels and 1.12 mace. Zhifengyong, Bingxing, and others sold considerably, plunging wildly by five taels, suddenly to 50 taels and 0.09 mace. Suddenly, Fuchang, Yuanxiang, Yongheng, and others had strong buying intentions, and Sumitomo and Korea absorbed 15,375 March British gold, then 3125. Therefore, the wind rose, the clouds surged, and it soared by six taels. When the prime rate was announced, it was 57 taels and 4.45 mace, and the posted price contracted by 1.275, the US dollar by 0.75, and the Japanese gold increased by 0.3125, and it already jumped to 58 taels and 5 mace, and even the internal price was even tighter. Korea's January British gold was 1525, and Shanghai sold April gold for 1525. After that, Yuanmaoyong and Xieyu sold, and the market turned from good to weak, and in just 28 minutes, it suddenly dropped by more than six taels, reaching 52 taels around ten o'clock. Afterwards, it rose and fell abruptly, actually with consolidation of four to five taels, making it very difficult to cope with. Transactions among colleagues were divided and hesitant. Yongfeng and hedgers entered, while Zhenchangxiang and Yu Da exited. Until after eleven o'clock, it seemed to move upward. Mitsui absorbed 15,3125 January British gold, followed by Shanghai and Sumitomo buying 25, approximately Hongli exited and then re-entered, and by 11:20 it had risen to 58 taels. In a moment, sellers took over, and Bingxing and others sold off, a huge drop of six taels in half an hour, to 52 taels at noon. Subsequently, many parties pushed up the ledger, and Bingxing and others bought in pursuit, jumping up three taels in a rush, and the closing price was 5 taels and 2 mace. The announced price has been changed to 697 taels and 6 mace, because the Japanese gold price plummeted by 3.125 points. It was initially pressed down to around 40 taels, then to 44 to 45 taels, and at noon it was 43 taels.</p>
<p>Evening Market Relatively Stable, Continuing to Rise 5 Taels and 3 Mace The after-hours market opened at 56 taels (gross price 5 to 6 taels). Afterwards, the Indian exchange rate was reported at 9 to 14 annas, and goods and retail customers bought in, and it rose immediately, to 57 taels and a half. In an instant, the selling pressure was still strong, but there were no large entries or exits, only scattered amounts. The price retreated by one or two taels. At 3:30, it was heard that the Indian exchange rate had risen by three annas again, and people's hearts were shaken. Yuanmaoyong and Hanheng and others sold off, and it fell to 54 taels and 5 mace. Before long, Xieyu, Hengxingyuan, and goods all came to compete to enter, and the market suddenly showed a good situation, soaring by four taels. At 3:50, it was 58 taels and 8 mace. After four o'clock, there were advances and retreats of more than one tael each, 4:10 it was 6 taels and 9 mace, then it was 8 taels, and then it fell to 7 taels, which was really because people's minds were unsettled. At 4:30, the market closed at 57 taels and 6 mace, an increase of 5 taels and 3 mace compared to the previous day. The highest price of the day was 58 taels and 8 mace, and the lowest price was 50 taels and 0.09 mace, a fluctuation of 7 taels and 9 mace. The morning price of goods was 5 taels and a half, the noon closing was 5 taels, the afternoon price was 5 taels and 8 mace, and the closing price was 7 taels and 8 mace. The announced price was pressed down to 41 taels to 39 taels, and finally 40 taels. The ledger price was 52 taels to 55 taels, and the water supplement was 52 taels, and in the afternoon it was 55 taels.</p>
<p>Speculative Transactions Difficult to Handle Transactions among colleagues, Chenfengyong, Xinheng, Yongheng, Yongfeng, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Changshengyong, and Yuancheng Yong were all buyers. Wanxing, Shunli, Dadecheng, Yuantai, and Tongtaichang were all entering and exiting abruptly. Bingxing bought more than 300 units and sold more than 500 units. Zhifengyong, Taikangrun, Yuancheng, Yu Da, and Zhenchangxiang were all sellers. Yuanmaoyong sometimes had demand and supply, and the overall balance was even. Also, the prime rate hedgers all entered. In the afternoon, Shunli, Wanxing, Xieyu, Hengxingyuan, and Fuchang all entered. Yuanmaoyong, Yuancheng, Chunyuanyong, Hanheng, and retail customers were all sellers. Dalian merchants had a total of 3,000 transactions, generally leveled. The Guangdong merchants' buying and selling was dull.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Initially Brisk, Then Hesitant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets plummeted, but transactions were not active, and the market conditions were stable. Suddenly, there was news from the United States supporting the market, and the exchange rate dropped slightly. Kobe and Yokohama did not change. The HSBC posted exchange rate was reduced by one and a half notches, with British gold down 375, to one shilling and five pence, the US dollar down 75, to 34 yuan and 375, the Indian exchange rate down 2.25 yuan, to 95 rupees and 25, the French franc down 20 yuan, to 875 yuan, the Japanese-Western currency down 2 yuan, to 85 taels and 25, the German exchange rate down 3 yuan, to 144 marks and 5, the slope exchange rate up 3.5 taels, to 163 taels and 5, and the Hong Kong exchange rate down 75, to 78 taels and a half. The Japanese gold then soared by 0.3125 points, reaching 1 tael and 4 mace and 4.5 cents. Although the British gold price was reduced, there was no official market, and the domestic price initially increased, but then there was slight consolidation, because the gold market changed suddenly and was difficult to grasp. By noon, it seemed to turn mild. Compared with the day before, the British gold was still down 1.875, the US dollar was down 0.375, and the Japanese gold was up 1.75 points. The gold price saw a new era, reaching beyond 658 taels. In the afternoon, because it was Wednesday, the various exchanges had no market conditions. The Chinese gold industry again threw out British gold and hedged into gold speculation. However, the banks' appetite was still strong. Japanese banks such as Sumitomo, Korea, Mitsui, and Zhengjin had particularly strong buying interest. Also, Huabi and Shanghai and others took in some, approximately 200,000 pounds in total. Also, Shanghai Mitsui also sold some. It was heard that the Jewish merchant Qiaorifu was still hedging. The various firms mutually transacted tens of thousands of pounds, and did over 1-200,000 yuan of US dollars. As for the Japanese gold, there was little in or out. The main reason the silver price was reduced so greatly was the fear that it would rise again.</p>

<p>American Silver Triangular 1.625 Points</p>
<p>According to a telegraph from London yesterday, the main silver price saw another disastrous fall. The trend was even more violent than before, and it continued to rush into the 15 pence barrier, opening a new era that had never been reached before. Underlying support in China sold off slightly, but the supply from other parties was lacking, and the market was unstable. The buying price after the closing was increased by 0.0625 based on the posted price. The United States strongly maintained the market.

<h3>Interest Rate and Demolition Market Uniformly Dismal</h3>
<p>Market Overview The silver and money industry feels inconvenienced by the issue of settling accounts for the Gregorian calendar this year due to various procedures and customs. Since the time is pressing, everyone is watching and waiting, fearing that they will not be able to clear everything uniformly by then. Therefore, transactions in the market recently have been exceptionally sluggish, and people's minds are more indolent than ever, resulting in no major changes in various market prices.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Demolition Price (Foreign Interest Rate) The early market interest rate was 7 mace, 2 fen, 4 li, and 5 hao, 2 hao and 5 si weaker than the previous day's noon market. The noon market was slightly better by 1 hao and 2 hu and 5 si, at 7 mace, 2 fen, 4 li, 6 hao, and 2 hu and 5 si.

<h3>Securities and Bond Market Quiet and Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond futures market was even more deserted. The morning session saw transactions of only slightly over 1.6 million, and the afternoon session only had slightly over 2.7 million, totaling 4.43 million. There were still slightly over 1.3 million in the 19th Customs, and over 1 million in demobilization. Although various spot transactions were opened, transactions were still scarce.

<h3>Yarn, Flower and Yarn Market Has a Chance to Stabilize</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, but the world situation is still sluggish. Large traders are calm and have no intention of short covering. However, the underlying support is relatively weak, and non-industry players dare not sell, so the situation has a chance to stabilize.</p>
<p>Man-Made Yarn Has a Small Rebound In the early market for man-made yarn, the market atmosphere was flat. Retail customers bought in a few lots and then the closing price rose. Some sold out and the price fell back. As a result, each month rose and fell by 1.2 mace. The afternoon opening was flat, and buying interest was slightly stronger in a few lots. Each month then rose by 3.4.5 mace. The total number of transactions for the day was 19,100 bales. It was found that Yiyu sold 1,950 bales, Yuantai 1,000 bales, Xinhua 1,150 bales, Dafeng 700 bales, and the rest 3.4.500 bales. Tianchang bought 1,200 bales, Lichang 850 bales, Yichang 950 bales, Gengfeng 750 bales, and the rest 3.4.5.600 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Most of the Actual Demand is Inland Sales of current yarn are still flat. It was found that the various gangs bought a total of 1,255 bales for the day. Fellow traders entered 25 bales. Customer gangs entered 515 bales to the interior, Jiangxi entered 190 bales, Guangdong entered 290 bales, Yantai entered 50 bales, Sichuan entered 50 bales, Shantou entered 40 bales, Hankou entered 40 bales, and Miscellaneous gangs entered 80 bales.</p>
<h3>This Month's Cotton Presents a Short Squeeze</h3>
<p>Distant Months Drive a Rising Trend</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending firm due to the strange contraction of the exchange rate and the slight rise in US cotton. Retail customers buy in. As for the buyers, they are tightening in the current month, and the intention to squeeze shorts is strong. Therefore, the distant months are driven by it. However, transactions for current cotton are blocked, and factory demand is quiet. It was found that imports of Indian cotton have been quite active recently, so various factories in China and abroad have no intention of purchasing.</p>
<p>Han Standard Soars by Two Mace In the early market for the Han standard, due to the rebound in US cotton, changes in foreign exchange rates, and still tight sentiment, each rose by 1-2 mace. The market atmosphere was still high in the afternoon, and each month rose again by 0.5-1 mace. The total number of transactions for the day was 45,200 dan. It was found that Shenchang sold 4,600 dan, Yuanda 2,200 dan, and Xincheng 1,800 dan, and the rest 1-2,000 dan. Tianlong bought 4,600 dan, Shenji 3,600 dan, Lichang 3,300 dan, and the rest 1-2,000 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>There is Absolutely No Consumption of Current Cotton Transactions in current cotton have disappeared. The sources from various roads amount to 300 bales of Tonghua and 1,500 bales of Yaohua.</p>
<h3>US Cotton and Osaka 3-Product Cotton Follow Different Paths</h3>
<p>US Cotton Turns Upward Due to Short Covering Yesterday, US cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, then tired due to weak sentiment on Wall Street, and finally rose again due to short covering. The futures rose by 11-15 points, and the spot rose by 15 points. British cotton futures rose by 12 points, and the spot rose by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 15 points. Indian cotton was firm due to good news from Liverpool, and brokers bought in. The near and distant terms for Pingguoer rose by 1 rupee, Aomula near and far terms were unchanged, and Bai Luo Creek rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (16th Special).</p>

<h3>US Cotton Maintenance Fails</h3>
<p>Exchange Advises Government to Let Go</p>
<p>The New Orleans Cotton Exchange announced that it is concerned about the night cotton market, and advises the government to take a laissez-faire approach. This is because the policies implemented by the Department of Agriculture to stabilize the cotton market have all failed. Over the past fifteen months, each bale has fallen by $24.50, and the losses are commensurate with a $600 million reduction in yield.</p>
<h3>November Foreign Cotton Imports Increase</h3>
<p>November statistics on foreign raw cotton imports: US cotton 33,012 bales, an increase of 1,452 bales compared to October; Indian cotton 40,565 bales, a decrease of 25 bales compared to the previous month; Egyptian cotton 550 bales, an increase of 300 bales compared to October; Burmese cotton 6,600 bales, an increase of 6,400 bales compared to the previous month.</p>
<h3>Grain White Kernel Rice Stepping Up by Three Jiao</h3>
<p>Special Top Reaches 14 Yuan and 2 Jiao</p>
<p>Sen Rice Slightly Firm, White Yuan Flat</p>
<p>Zhabei Yesterday, the source of rice from the river downstream became scarce, with only about 20 vendors arriving. Sales were brisk due to the rain, and the atmosphere was clear. Special top grade japonica rice rose by as much as three jiao, opening high at 14 yuan and 2 jiao. The medium and sub-grade japonica rice all rose by two jiao. According to reports, the production market has been tight for several days, and the output is scarce. Therefore, the rice market is unlikely to fall in the future. The sales of thin rice are still good. The big price is slightly tighter. The market atmosphere is not as lively as the japonica market. Due to the rain, the sentiment for Yang Du Sen rice is very good, and high grades have seen some transactions. The prices are generally good for the 2 jiao range. The big price of the port Sen rice is following the 1,000 jiao. Currently, there is not much Sen rice in the river, and the underlying support is extremely firm. Bian Yuan and Yin Yuan have both thick arrivals, but the sales are sluggish and not easy to improve. The prices are mediocre. Currently, the total inventory of the entire market is slightly over 120. Except for half of the northern japonica rice, most of the remainder is white yuan.</p>
<p>Hunan Yesterday, ten vendors arrived from all roads. Sales in this street were active. The high grades of northern japonica rice all rose by 2-3 jiao. Sales to stores and stomachs are the best. Sales of Su rice are very smooth. The thin rice and early rice of the Southern Gang are slightly tight by a jiao or so. The Yang Sen rice is scarce and sales are strong, rising by 1 jiao and a half. The Du Sen rice arrivals are going away flat, turning slightly tight. The circulation of Bian Hua is dull and the big price is unchanged. Ordinary Bian Yuan is barely opening at 12 yuan and 5-6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour Market's Downtrend is Strong Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market faced a sharp decline in all months. The quotations for foreign wheat fell again by 2-3 to 5-6-7 jiao, causing panic among all people. Most speculative short traders were even more afraid due to the fact that the large manufacturers had a short position for the far term of about 200,000. The bullish traders also found it difficult to defend their positions due to the end of the year, so they also sold out, and the market's decline finally reappeared. However, after the third session in the afternoon, the market's atmosphere revived slightly due to short covering. As a result, the current month was down 1.25 fen from the previous day, the first month was down 2 fen, the second month was down 1.7 fen, the third month was down 2.4 fen, the fourth month was down 1.75 fen, and the fifth month was down 1.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market is Stable in the Near Term and Falling in the Far Term</h3>
<p>After yesterday's opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, each month was stable in the near term and falling in the far term. The current month is close to the expiration date, so short traders must buy in daily to prepare for delivery. If a general problem occurs, there may still be disputes. As for the distant months, the quotations for foreign wheat have recovered slightly, but people's minds are fatigued, and most short sellers have already failed to prevent it in the near term. All the remaining chips have been transferred to the far term, so the selling pressure is strong and the market is tired. As a result, the current month is up 1 fen from the previous day, the first month is down 4 fen, the second month is down 6 fen, and the third to fifth months are down 4 fen. The current wheat is still quiet due to the inactivity of manufacturers.</p>
<h3>Hunan Rice Arriving in Smaller Quantities Daily</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for "ke hsien" rice remained stagnant. However, inquiries continued on this street. The arrival of a small amount of Jiangxi Nanjing rice was sufficient to meet the demand on this street, resulting in a balance between supply and sales, and a stable market. Since Hunan rice was subject to tax reductions in that province, some shipments occurred. Recently, due to the year-end closing, vendors are mostly uninvolved. High-level merchants with surplus funds are hesitant due to shallow waters in the area and unrest among bandits and soldiers along the way. Consequently, daily arrivals have decreased. It is expected that after current shipments arrive, large quantities will not reach Shanghai until next spring. Yesterday, the overall market transactions included 380 bags of Jiangxi "ji wan" rice, priced at 11.3 to 10.85 yuan; 300 bags of "ji yuan" rice, priced at 12.5 to 12 yuan; 300 bags of Nanjing "ji" rice, priced at 10.15 to 10 yuan; 100 bags of brown rice, priced at 8.6 yuan; and 200 bags of "liu" rice, priced at 10.15 yuan. All were reportedly handled by businesses on this street.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated White Sugar Initially Stiff, Then Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market received telegrams from production areas stating that Cuban raw sugar had fallen slightly by 0.01875. New York futures sugar for December fell by 0.03, and for September next year, it fell by 0.04. Java futures and spot sugar remained largely unchanged. Initially, due to the sharp rise in exchange rates, the Coarse Granulated White Sugar market seemed strong, with high asking prices and few buyers. Later, as selling intentions increased, the transaction price remained at 8.45 taels, with limited trading. No. 20 Medium Granulated White Sugar was in short supply at 7.65 taels. Later, an asking price of 7.7 taels still attracted few inquiries. Japanese sugar YT mark was priced at 8.55 to 8.5 taels; YP mark at 9 taels; Meiji sugar at 9.05 taels; YR mark at 8.05 taels; and N mark at 8.8 taels. The market appeared stable. Taikoo O mark, for immediate shipment, continued to offer 1,000 bags at the same price of 5.45 taels. With the new tax increase, the firm Bingchang offered 1,000 bags of No. 8 Dutch Red sugar from existing stock at 7.2 taels, but demand was weak. Domestically produced Superior Ice White sugar opened higher at 11.1 taels, with a high asking price of 11.5 taels, but no transactions. The market was quite firm. Another shipment of 6,000 bags of New Green Sugar arrived, with the asking price remaining at the original 7.2 taels, but the goods were considered relatively high quality and the market was brisk. It is rumored that over 200 more bags will arrive tomorrow to meet market demand.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Anhui Cocoon Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>The Shanghai dried cocoon market remains quiet. Merchants holding surplus cocoons are mostly insisting on high prices. Manufacturers, due to low raw silk prices and significant losses, are not inclined to replenish their stocks. The market sentiment is one of holding firm. Yesterday, a manufacturer from Zhenjiang imported 380 packages (750 catties) of Anhui dried cocoons, with the reeling conversion price set at 76 taels. The cocoon cost was estimated at 560-570 taels, plus over 200 taels for cocoon processing, resulting in a silk cost of over 800 taels. According to current market silk prices, manufacturers would incur a loss of approximately 100 taels.</p>
<h3>Fine Hyson and Congou Teas Sold Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai foreign firm tea market, Zhenmei green teas from Lailu Estate were slightly purchased by firms such as Shih, Tianyu, and Dood. High-quality estates were offered at an opening price of 115 taels, while medium and low-quality estates were offered at prices ranging from 43 to 90 taels. Market prices showed no increase or decrease compared to previous levels. Low-quality Congou green teas were also being handled by firms such as Rucheng and Nianhaozhi from Baitou Estate, but market prices were extremely low. Although British firms continued to buy other items such as Zhenmei and Xiumei teas, their inventories were substantial, making it difficult to reverse the trend.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News:</p>
<p>Fifty cases of Huzhou silk and 300 boxes of silk fabrics are being shipped to the United States today.</p>
<p>Two thousand nine hundred and sixty-three boxes of tea are being shipped to New York today.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Decides on the Deadline for Settling Accounts This Year</h3>
<p>To be February 15th of the 20th year.</p>
<p>The Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Issues an Important Statement</p>
<p>The matter of year-end account settlement according to the Gregorian calendar has recently drawn attention from all sectors. The State Council has discussed and reached a relevant solution. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce specifically held a meeting yesterday to decide on the deadline for settling accounts after the Gregorian calendar year-end. The following is a record of news from various sources:</p>
<p>Telegram from Minister of Industry Kong: To the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Banking Association, and Money Exchange Association: The account settlement issue was brought before the State Council today. It was resolved that the account settlement date be set at the end of the Gregorian calendar year. Debt repayments and collections shall continue to be handled according to the original agreements. Those without agreements may settle payments at any time. Urgently wired. Please inform all industries. Kong Xiangxi [stamped].</p>
<p>Proposal by Mr. Wang Yansong: Wang Yansong, a standing committee member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, proposed a plan for the deadline for settling accounts at yesterday's joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce. The original text reads: "Having investigated the use of the Gregorian calendar, the government has issued repeated orders to enforce it. The former Chamber of Commerce Rectification Committee received an official letter from the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, requesting deliberation on a phased plan for account settlement according to the Gregorian calendar. It was then resolved that, starting from the 19th year, the end of the Gregorian calendar year would be the general closing date for the business community. This was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and announced for compliance. After the formal establishment of the Chamber of Commerce, it would publicize this in the newspapers before the end of May and September, which are the periods for account settlement, and close the office for one day on the settlement date to show promotion. Subsequently, as the year-end general closing approached, various industries, due to foreign account relations, were in the initial stages and needed to prepare in advance to avoid delays. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce publicized in advance to remind all industries to pay attention. The money exchange, coal, rice, and silk industries also successively announced, urging foreign merchants to prepare early. Shanghai is a financial circulation market, and Shanghai can only become the central hub if all regions uniformly comply with the Gregorian calendar for account settlement. However, the Chambers of Commerce of 39 counties, including Zhenjiang and Suzhou, collectively discussed in Zhenjiang province and considered that in the southern and northern regions of Jiangsu Province, most of the new grains were still in the hands of rural farmers and could not be easily converted into money to repay debts. Rural stores could not close their accounts, so how could city stores clear their accounts? It was requested that the measures for collecting grain in Jiangsu province be followed, with February 16th of the following year as the deadline. The resolution was submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for record. At the same time, the Chambers of Commerce in Hangzhou, Wuhu, and other places also requested an extension of one and a half months due to practical difficulties. The date was the same as the request from the Chambers of Commerce of the 39 counties in Jiangsu province. This Chamber of Commerce believes that it is difficult for the Gregorian calendar account settlement to be uniform across the country. If, by the end of the year, debts owed must be repaid on time, but debts owed to us cannot be recovered, it will inevitably lead to a lack of circulation and mutual collapse. What a terrible aftermath to imagine! On the one hand, we have received letters from various industry associations, stating the difficulties and requesting discussion of alternative measures. This Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly reviewed and decided to follow the former official letter from the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to the former Chamber of Commerce Rectification Committee, and to modify the request for a general closing date for the business community to be one day before the Beginning of Spring each year, according to the period before and after the solar term. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs believes that since the founding of the Republic, the late Premier had clearly defined the calendar, and the promotion of the Gregorian calendar still requires efforts today. The Chamber of Commerce, as a model for the business community, should work hard itself to supervise and guide, and that the requested modification is difficult to approve. After the notification was sent to the Chamber of Commerce, various industry associations successively published announcements, deciding to comply with the Gregorian calendar for year-end account settlement, indicating the Municipal Government's determination to promote the Gregorian calendar and move forward bravely. However, the request from various local chambers of commerce to extend it by one and a half months has not yet been officially approved by the local provincial government. At the same time, stores in this city who settle accounts with other regions often only receive a general notice from local industry associations to postpone payment. The northeastern and southwestern provinces are even more unaware of the so-called reform of account settlement. The overall situation cannot be unified, and although merchants in this city want to abandon old habits, they are already forced by the environment. In fact, it is impossible to implement a general closing at the end of the Gregorian calendar year, and instead, colleagues will use it as a tool for squeezing and oppressing each other. The commercial market is shaken, and dangerous situations arise. Seeing this situation, Yansong felt deeply that it was dangerous. Just as it was extremely difficult, the fourth meeting of the Executive Yuan of the Executive Yuan, according to the telegram from the Municipal Government, transferred to the Chamber of Commerce the request from the Shipping Association to follow the Gregorian calendar for account settlement, and still follow the original agreement for collecting funds. It was resolved, 'The account settlement date is set at the end of the Gregorian calendar year. Debt repayments and collections shall continue to be handled according to the original agreements. Those without agreements may settle payments at any time.' In the promotion of the Gregorian calendar, the intention is to take care of the difficulties of the business community. However, Yansong believes that for this year's collection and payment of funds, although there is a standard according to the original agreement date, the date should be converted according to the Gregorian calendar as a result of following the Gregorian calendar in order to determine the trend and avoid confusion. Therefore, based on the resolution of the Executive Yuan, the following measures are proposed: (1) Shanghai has close relations with Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and the most transactions occur. The situation is also roughly the same. The date of February 15th of the 20th year is already the date for public collection and payment of funds by merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Therefore, the collection and payment of funds in this city should also be limited to February 15th of the 20th year. (2) Store employees have access to funds. Now that the collection and payment of funds is limited to February 15th of the 20th year, the entry and exit of store employees should wait until the funds they have access to are collected and paid clearly. Please set the period from February 16th to 20th of the 20th year as the period for stores to enter and exit employees. (3) The current year's transaction books of money exchanges should be used until the date of the end of the collection and payment of funds. Starting from February 16th, new books for the 20th year should be opened. The above three measures are all problems that merchants must solve in fact. If they are decided, the Chamber of Commerce will publish them in the newspaper and submit them to the competent authorities of this city for record. Is it feasible? Please discuss and decide." Proposer: Wang Yansong.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Discussion: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce held the ninth executive committee meeting and the fifth supervisory committee joint meeting at 4 PM yesterday, and invited Yu Qiaqing and representatives from the banking and money exchange associations to attend. The Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee members Wang Xiaolai, Ye Huijun, Wang Yansong, Pei Yunqing, Gu Xinyi, Luo Qinghua, Wu Zhihao, Lu Fengzhu, Fang Jiaobo, Lu Qisheng, Wen Lanting, Ma Jiliang, Chen Songyuan, Cheng Xiechun, Xu Jili, Bank Association representative Lin Kanghou, Money Exchange Association representatives Qin Runqing, Hu Xisheng, etc., attended. Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting, and Secretary Yan E'sheng took notes. After the formalities were completed, the Secretary reported on the Ministry of Finance's telegram on tax adjustment and Minister Kong's telegram. Then, the Chairman reported on the handling of the Gregorian calendar account settlement case. Next, the discussion began. First, proposer Wang Yansong explained the reasons for the proposal in detail. Then, Yu Qiaqing reported on his personal trip to Beijing to petition. Subsequently, Wen Lanting, Qin Runqing, Xu Jili, Lin Kanghou, Hu Xisheng, Luo Qinghua, Chen Songyuan, and others expressed their opinions, explaining in detail. After two hours of discussion, it was resolved that: (1) The deadline for this year's total collection and settlement is February 15th of the 20th year. (2) The entry and exit of employees will be from February 16th to 20th of the 20th year. The announcement was drafted on the spot, passed, and disseminated before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Official Announcement Passed: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce announces the deadline for settling accounts after the closing of accounts: It was resolved at the State Council meeting on the 16th of this month that the account settlement date is set at the end of the Gregorian calendar year. Debt repayments and collections shall continue to be handled according to the original agreements. Those without agreements may settle payments at any time. Now, the ninth executive committee meeting and the fifth supervisory committee joint meeting of this Chamber of Commerce, and specially invited representatives from the two Banking Associations of this city to attend, resolved that the deadline for collecting and settling accounts this year is agreed to be February 15th of the 20th year. In addition to submitting it to the government for record, it is hereby announced in the newspaper for your information.</p>
<p>Important Remarks by Pan Gongzhan: A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specifically visited Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, yesterday regarding the Gregorian calendar account settlement case, and inquired about his opinions in detail. According to his reply, when the late Premier first took office as Provisional President in the founding of the Republic, he issued a clear decree defining the solar calendar as the national calendar. For more than ten years, the people followed it superficially but disobeyed it in reality. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it reiterated the announcement. The Central Party Headquarters ordered efforts to promote the Gregorian calendar, and the people's views gradually shifted. Last year was the year to start implementing it. The National Government clearly ordered that all contracts, documents, and vouchers using the lunar calendar date would not be legally effective. This city followed the central government's orders and worked hard to implement them. In consideration of the business situation, it notified the Chamber of Commerce Rectification Committee to decide on the annual account settlement date for the business community. After several discussions, the committee decided to settle accounts in three phases: the end of May, the end of September, and the end of the year, with the end of the Gregorian calendar year as the general closing. It was also considered that there was insufficient preparation for the year-end general settlement last year, so it requested a delay of no more than one month. This Bureau adopted it and submitted it to the Municipal Government for transmittal to the National Government for approval and record, and announced it for compliance throughout the country. Therefore, this issue is actually a national issue and a measure that was approved by the Central Government early last year. As for the local government of this city, it only knows to comply with national laws and regulations and has absolutely no prejudice. However, since there was insufficient preparation at the end of last year, there has been a year of time this year. Recently, there have been those who requested modification due to insufficient collection and settlement. The local government of this city believes that it is beyond its authority and cannot make its own decisions. Since the inland areas can approve modification earlier, but this city has not yet approved it, those outside do not understand and think that this is someone's opinion. In fact, those who know it will be able to tell for themselves who is complying with laws and regulations, who is violating laws and regulations, who is following the late Premier's teachings, and who is disregarding the teachings. Now that the State Council has resolved that accommodation is possible, although no official document has been received, according to reports, it should be a fact. For lower-level agencies, their responsibility is only to comply with laws and regulations, and they should not have any proposals. However, since I have been asked for my opinion, there are several points that I can tell you: (1) The account settlement date is still the end of the Gregorian calendar year and has not changed. It can be seen that the Central Government's purpose of promoting the Gregorian calendar has not changed slightly. All changes to private account books should still be closed at the end of the year if they are usually closed annually. (2) Repaying and collecting accounts should still be handled according to the original agreement. If private individuals or merchants have indeed made an original agreement and the contract stipulates the date for repaying in the Gregorian calendar, it will be valid (contracts made using the lunar calendar are invalid, as seen in the National Government's earlier announcement). The government has not interfered in this. If the business community uses current account agreements to stipulate year-end repayment, this year-end is of course the Gregorian calendar year-end. (3) Those without agreements can settle payments at any time. There seems to be room for research in this regard. Repaying and collecting accounts can theoretically be done at any time if there is no contract clearly stipulated, but due to our country's business customs, this type of account without a fixed contract should be paid in three installments, and the end of the year is particularly important. Failure to pay at the end of the year will affect credit. If only accounts are settled this year, but repaying and collecting can be done at any time, then there will be even more disputes in the future. Personally speaking, A and B can agree on one period, and C and D can agree on another period. Locally speaking, A can set one date, and B can set another date. If this kind of phenomenon occurs in the future, the chaos in society will be even worse than today. Therefore, the third measure set by the Central Government should actually be supplemented urgently, otherwise, the market chaos will be unthinkable. The supplementary measures are nothing more than two key points, namely (1) those who collect and pay at any time must have the consent of both parties, or (2) the Central Government clearly sets an extension date and announces it to all regions for uniform compliance, without any differences. This extension date must absolutely not be hidden on the lunar calendar New Year's Eve, such as February 16, so as to avoid the major error of accommodating the abandoned calendar, but there are not many days left, and I do not know if the Central Government will be able to understand this. Furthermore, the issue of merchants closing down at the end of the year and the beginning of the year, the issue of continuing business in the coming year, and the issue of entry and exit of store employees, etc., should still be handled according to the usual year, except for specific contracts. It has nothing to do with the collection and repayment of accounts at any time. Otherwise, accounts will be collected and paid at any time, and there will be no end, how can employees also enter and exit at any time? Since the closure is called the end of the year and the beginning of the year, it can be even more understood that it cannot be transferred due to the collection and repayment of accounts at any time. Finally, I personally can get a lesson from this matter, that is, in this society with deep-rooted and pervasive inertia, the result of wanting to comply with laws and regulations slightly may be less praiseworthy than those who violate laws and regulations and succumb to the environment. However, from the standpoint of those who try their best to transform society, it seems that efforts should still be made to promote the Gregorian calendar, and it is especially hoped that the Central Government will have unified orders.</p>

<h3>Telegraphic Request for General Amnesty on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Criminals are Driven by the Environment and Created by Politics</p>
<p>A General Amnesty Would Pardon Their Past and Allow Them to Renew Themselves</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, the owner of the Sanbei Company, upon reading reports that the amnesty decree only covered political prisoners and did not stipulate anything for ordinary prisoners, telegraphed the Chairman of the National Government and various ministries and courts yesterday, requesting that they also be granted a general amnesty. The original telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Heads of Various Courts: To the Presidents of the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and Judicial Yuan of the Nanjing National Government: It is reported that a general amnesty will be granted on New Year's Day next year. The new era begins with this grand event, which is very grand. However, it only pardons political prisoners and does not include ordinary prisoners, which must be a mistaken rumor. Moreover, a general amnesty should be universal, as is the case in the legal codes of various countries in the East and West, and not only is this the case in the precedents of our country's history. In general, human hearts are not good. In addition to major rectifications, it can be seen that the causes of crimes are all driven by the environment. In recent years, there have been frequent disturbances, people have lost their jobs, and survival is difficult. The cowardly lightly give up their lives and often commit suicide, while the strong take risks and commit crimes. This harsh environment is actually created by politics. Now, political prisoners are still invited to a lenient pardon, while ordinary prisoners lack a way to renew themselves. Judging from the situation and reasoning, can it be said to be fair? Moreover, government spending is extremely stretched. Once a general amnesty is granted, the funds used to support prisoners can be used to improve prisons, which is both passively and actively effective. I believe that except for those who have been sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment and life imprisonment, whose crimes are serious and should not be lightly pardoned, the remaining prisoners should be pardoned uniformly. Those who commit crimes again after the pardon should be punished more severely, pardoning their past and warning them of their future, which is a win-win situation. At this time, with the unification of the North and South and the renewal of the world, it is important to establish the grand model of the founding of the country and give the people a new beginning. The matter concerns a major event, and I hope that it will accord with reason. I respectfully submit this telegram and hope for your consideration. Yu Hede, Xiaozhen.</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Jiang: To Chairman Jiang of the National Government: It is reported that political prisoners will be granted a general amnesty on New Year's Day, but ordinary prisoners will not be included. If this is the case, it means that major criminals can be renewed, but ordinary people cannot be granted a lenient pardon. Putting the cart before the horse may go against public opinion. In addition to telegraphing the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Yuan in detail about my humble opinions, I beg your Excellency to preside over the general amnesty and give the people a new beginning. It would be a great blessing. The two telegrams were sent last night.</p>
<p>Employees of the pawnshop industry</p>
<h3>Decided to Strike Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Party Department's final mediation failed due to the absence of the capitalists.</p>
<p>The Trade Union convened an emergency meeting of representatives.</p>
<p>A declaration was issued to notify pawnbrokers and a letter to the citizens.</p>
<p>The city's pawnbroking industry trade union held an emergency meeting of representatives yesterday, attended by over two hundred representatives from the five districts (east, south, west, north, and central). It was resolved that a general strike would commence uniformly from today (the 18th). The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Details of Demands: There are a total of 109 pawnshops in the city, old and new, employing over 3,000 workers. In July of this year, the workers noted that the labor and capital treatment conditions agreed upon in the Republic of China Year 16 (1927) had largely not been implemented. Furthermore, the monthly salary was difficult to sustain in comparison with the current cost of living. Therefore, a request was submitted to the trade union to propose amendments to the conditions to the capitalists' association. The trade union submitted this suggestion to the Party Department for approval, before formally presenting it to the capitalists' association. However, the matter dragged on for months without resolution. On the 5th of this month, the city's pawnbroking industry workers held a representatives' meeting and resolved to stage a work slowdown as a petition. Zhang Yaoming, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, strongly advised against this, stating that the Municipal Party Department would work with the Social Affairs Bureau to conduct a final mediation. If this yielded no results, then the work slowdown could be implemented. Thus, the trade union issued a notice to all workers to temporarily postpone the work slowdown, and on the 11th of this month, sent representatives to the Municipal Party Department and Municipal Government to petition in person.</p>
<p>Party Department Mediation: In order to resolve the dispute, the Municipal Party Department convened representatives from both labor and capital on the afternoon of the 12th to conduct mediation. The capitalists stated that they needed to wait for a general meeting of all members on the 15th before a decision could be made. The Party Department then scheduled a final mediation for yesterday (the 17th) afternoon. Yesterday at 1 p.m., trade union representatives Wang Ganchen, Cheng Xingzhu, Li Fulin, and Shen Tianjue, among others, went to the Party Department on time to await mediation. Guo Yongxi, a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, also attended. Tao Baichuan from the Party Department's People's Training Committee met with them and stated that the capitalists' association representatives, Fang Minfu, Yu Shaoqing, Zhu Songfu, and Chen Rufu, had informed the Municipal Party Department and Social Affairs Bureau that they could not attend today's (17th) mediation at the Party Department. This was because the capitalists' association members' meeting on the 15th had not passed the first item of the workers' request to amend the treatment conditions, namely, "The pawn industry association</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>shall acknowledge that the pawnbroking industry trade union has full authority to represent all members." The remaining items had also not been discussed. Therefore, no mediation representatives had been dispatched. As a result, the capitalists' representatives were absent today, and the Party Department was unable to conduct mediation. Upon hearing this, the representatives became agitated and left.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting: Yesterday at 3 p.m., the four representatives, Wang Ganchen, Cheng Xingzhu, Li Fulin, and Shen Tianjue, returned to the trade union and reported the situation of their attendance at the Party Department to await mediation without results. The trade union immediately convened a temporary emergency meeting of worker representatives from the five districts (east, south, west, north, and central), attended by over two hundred people. Wang Ganchen was publicly elected as chairman. After reporting the significance of the meeting, Cheng Xingzhu reported on the process of the four representatives attending the Party Department to await mediation. A discussion of proposals then followed: (1) That all members of the conditions demand movement committee resign unanimously. Resolution: Passed unanimously. (2) That all pawnbroking industry workers in the city commence a general strike uniformly from the 18th. Resolution: Passed unanimously. (3) To establish a strike committee. Resolution: Thirteen committee members were elected. A general commander was also elected from among the strike committee members. The following was divided into five districts (east, south, west, north, and central), with one district captain in each district. Each district was further divided into several teams, and each team was further divided into several groups. Command was unified, and orders were consistent. In addition, there were various sections such as discipline, investigation, propaganda, and negotiation. (4) To submit the strike for record to various agencies such as the Municipal Party Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Public Security Bureau. (5) To issue a strike declaration and a letter to the citizens, and to urgently notify all workers and Party members in the city. Various slogans were also issued.</p>

<p>Notice to Workers: Notice Regarding the case of this trade union requesting amendments to the treatment conditions from the capitalists, serious negotiations have been conducted repeatedly, but all have been ineffective. Further requests were made to the Municipal Party Department to convene mediation, but the capitalists consistently refused to accept it. In light of this situation, this trade union, looking back at the workers, their future protection has become hopeless. Therefore, it was resolved at the representatives' meeting on the 17th of this month that a strike would be implemented from the 18th to make a final struggle to awaken the capitalists. All members of each team must comply with the order and implement the strike from the 18th, assembling in teams. This matter concerns personal interests and must not be disobeyed. This is an urgent notice. Strike Committee of the Shanghai Pawnbroking Industry Trade Union.</p>
<p>Strike Declaration: The Shanghai Pawnbroking Industry Trade Union, in view of the capitalists' failure to accept the conditions, issues a strike declaration stating: "Fellow workers, since the establishment of this trade union in the Republic of China Year 16 (1927), a labor-capital contract has been signed with the capitalists. It has been three years since then. During these past three years, although the capitalists have violated the contract from time to time, this trade union, for the sake of settling matters, has not dwelled on the reasons. The reason is that all our workers, although suppressed by the capitalists, still treat people with sincerity, hoping that the capitalists can change their ways and work together for mutual progress. However, in recent years, the cost of living has increased day by day, and the capitalists only care about their personal desires and disregard the suffering of all the workers. Therefore, the workers are in this predicament, and the rights they obtain for the obligations they fulfill each month simply cannot be sustained. Therefore, the original conditions were proposed for amendment in July of this year. The purpose and extent of the amendment were considered comprehensively. On the one hand, it would ensure that the capitalists' business would not be affected, and on the other hand, it would slightly compensate the workers' lives. The principle of equality was weighed, and after being passed at a general meeting, it was submitted to the Municipal Party Department for review. Subsequently, a request was made to the capitalists to amend it. After more than ten consultations over several months, the capitalists always responded with perfunctory excuses. In the midst of this trade union's urgent request, they verbally promised to dispatch responsible representatives for negotiations, but in reality, they still avoided meeting. Secret meetings to discuss undermining this trade union's conspiracy were often heard of. Tracing back to the members' meeting convened on October 26 of this year, the capitalists even used destructive methods, mobilizing the imperialist constabulary to arrest workers and forcibly prevent members from attending, fabricating rumors, and dissolving the unity of the workers. Countless conspiracies were recorded. However, this trade union was determined to endure the pain temporarily and seek peace in the future. The fundamental issue was still to seek a resolution to the conditions. Therefore, we were still unwilling to have a breakdown in relations with the capitalists. Now, the capitalists still do not understand the workers' hardship and are attacking step by step. This trade union, in this dangerous situation, after requesting all trade unions in the city to jointly petition the Party and government agencies, the Social Affairs Bureau once convened a hearing, earnestly advised, and both sides voluntarily resolved the issue peacefully. However, the capitalists still used their old tricks. Further requests were made to the government, but the government rejected them, stating that "the workers in this industry are not all workers and cannot be subject to the Labor Dispute Resolution Law. They should file a lawsuit in court." After pondering this, this trade union believes that labor organizations do not have the funds to file a petition in court. Therefore, the workers are in dire straits, their freedom is restricted, and the government's rejection of the amendment conditions means that hope is about to be lost. Therefore, another representatives' meeting was convened on the 5th of this month to take measures. At that time, the entire meeting advocated adopting a strike as a response. The Municipal Party Department representative strongly advised against it, and this trade union's representatives respected the Party Department's wishes and tentatively accepted it. It was also decided to hold a full-scale work slowdown on the 12th to petition the Party and government agencies in formation. At that time, it was close to the anniversary of the Communist Party's Guangzhou Uprising, and the military and police authorities were heavily guarded, fearing misunderstandings and giving the capitalists an excuse. Considering that if we implemented a work slowdown petition, on the one hand, the capitalists would suffer a day's loss, and on the other hand, social peace and the lives of citizens would also be affected for a day. Therefore, the decision to implement a work slowdown petition was abandoned and representatives were sent to petition the Party and government agencies instead. Subsequently, the Municipal Party Department saw that our turmoil was latent and sent personnel to earnestly advise us in advance. It also convened a reconciliation meeting between the two sides on the 12th of this month. However, the capitalists stubbornly spread rumors and mediation failed. The Party Department then scheduled another mediation for the 17th, but the capitalists not only habitually used deceptive tactics and refused to accept the conditions, but also defied the Party Department's orders, failed to send representatives to attend, and convened a general meeting to resolve not to recognize our legally organized group. In this situation, the capitalists really want to put us to death and deliberately create a labor dispute. The reason for the capitalists' attitude is that the committee members of the capitalists' association, such as Chuan Zuoheng, are in control. Looking around at this capitalist high-pressure situation, the request to amend the conditions has become hopeless. The workers are oppressed by their livelihoods and their lives are in danger, so they have to sacrifice everything and implement a strike to engage in a life-and-death struggle with the capitalists. Before this trade union implemented the strike movement, we never disregarded the livelihoods of the common people and social harmony. However, the capitalists are stubborn and arrogant, believing that workers can be deceived, and have always used cunning conspiracies to put us in a desperate situation. This trade union is a mass organization, and all words and actions are based on the wishes of the masses. The sole purpose of this action is to resolve the conditions and does not contain any colored illegal actions. We respectfully hope that fellow workers, standing on the same working class, embrace the determination to share the same boat and provide assistance in words and strength. This declaration is hereby issued. Printed and distributed by the Strike Committee of the Shanghai Pawnbroking Industry Trade Union.</p>
<p>Letter to Citizens: The Shanghai Pawnbroking Industry Trade Union's letter to the citizens of the city. Dear citizens of the city, we are on strike. The reasons for our strike have been clearly written in the news reports disclosed in various newspapers over the past few months and do not need to be repeated. However, this very important matter must be earnestly reported to the citizens of the city once again. That is, before the strike turmoil occurred, the pawnbroking industry capitalists repeatedly deceived the workers. Although we repeatedly requested and proceeded in a peaceful manner, they always ignored us. At the same time, we requested the government to intervene, but the government also refused to accept the case. Later, the Municipal Party Department saw the turmoil that we were undergoing and, on the one hand, sent personnel to advise us and, on the other hand, tried to convene mediation between the two sides. However, as a result of forcing two mediations, the capitalists not only refused to accept the amendment conditions, but also refused to recognize our workers' organization. In this dire situation, we always felt that a strike was the most unfortunate thing and also the thing that we least wanted to do, because a strike not only has a great impact and loss on both sides, but also has a close relationship with social finance and the lives of citizens. We originally did not dare to act rashly. Now, the capitalists are stubborn and deceive us workers, destroying our lives to the extreme. If we continue to use peaceful methods to request a satisfactory resolution, it would be like climbing a tree to catch fish. Therefore, we disregard everything, resolutely leave our dear citizens, and engage in a life self-defense movement. We hope that the citizens of the city will accept our earnest report and provide sympathetic assistance. Strike Committee of the Shanghai Pawnbroking Industry Trade Union. Notice to Pawners: The workers in this industry are forced to declare a strike because the capitalists refuse to accept the amendment conditions and there is no way to appeal. Please forgive all pawners. This is a notice. Initiated by the Strike Committee of the Shanghai Pawnbroking Industry Trade Union.</p>
<p>Submission for Record: The Pawnbroking Industry Trade Union decided to submit the case to the Municipal Party Department, Social Affairs Bureau, and Public Security Bureau today for record. The original text stated: "Submitted because the capitalists refuse to accept the conditions and deny the workers' legally organized group, which is extremely antagonistic and we have no choice but to declare a strike. We respectfully request your review and recording of the matter. This trade union has been requesting the capitalists to amend the conditions for several months, and more than ten consultations have been held. The capitalists have been perfunctory and evasive. The Municipal Party Department, in order to avoid turmoil, has repeatedly convened both sides with the Social Affairs Bureau to discuss reconciliation methods. The capitalists have refused to accept the conditions and deny the workers' legally organized group. Who can endure such destruction of workers? We will implement a strike from today to fight to the death. We respectfully request your review and recording of the case, and also request the Public Security Bureau to send police to provide constant protection every day to avoid the mixing of reactionary elements. The presentation is extremely urgent. Presented to the Municipal Party Department, Social Affairs Bureau, and Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Pawnbroking Workers' Strike Committee.</p>
<p>Unified Action: Respectfully informing you that since this trade union proposed the amendment conditions, the capitalists have ignored them. After several months of stalemate, this trade union can no longer endure it. We would rather be a broken jade than a whole tile. Therefore, the representatives' meeting decided on the 17th of this month to declare a strike and resolved to send a letter to the small number of workers who have not joined this trade union to take unified action, etc. In order to comply with the resolution of the General Assembly, a corresponding letter is hereby sent to notify you. We sincerely hope that the small number of workers who have not joined this trade union will suspend business during this strike period and cooperate together. It is gratefully appreciated. A letter is hereby sent for your kind attention. Initiated by the Strike Committee of the Shanghai Pawnbroking Industry Trade Union.</p>

<p>Once Committed a Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>There Were Six Other Robberies</p>
<p>Two Prostitute Households Also Suffered</p>
<p>Yesterday's Interrogation of the Two Prostitute Robbery Cases</p>
<p>Detectives Lu Liankui and Liu Shaokui, detective captains Feng Baishun, Wang Chengying, and Feng Zhiming, detectives Xie Futang and Shen Tianbao, etc., from the General Inspectorate of the General Patrol Office, have successively arrested thirty-one male and female bandits, including Dong Yushu, Wan Ansheng, Wang Fusheng, Shen Xingda, Shen Yonglin, Sun Chansheng, Xia Jintang, Zhang Rongfu, Zhu Xiangting, Qiang Kunpei, He Ahong, Shen Ayou, Chen Enwei, Rong Jiannan, Zhu Rongsheng, Li Dachu, Wang Zhongmei, Yu Jinlin, Shen Amao, Feng Shuncai, Qiang Fugou, Zhao Xinrong, Li Shi, and Zhang Jinshi, etc., since the 6th of last month. Five handguns, 357 bullets, and seven cartridge boxes were seized. After a long investigation, it has been ascertained that</p>
<p>One kidnapping case, which was on the evening of September 18th at 8:00 PM, was the kidnapping of Cai Fuyuan, the comprador of the British American Tobacco Company, outside No. 55 and a half on Hart Road. In addition, there were six cases of armed robbery, two of which involved</p>
<p>The victims were prostitutes. One case involved Jia Baoyu and Ye Feilong, who were robbed on the night of October 19th when the group pretended to be customers and called them to Room 441 of the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road, taking diamond rings, treasure rings, watches, and other ornaments worth a total of 175 yuan. Another case involved Xiang Fei and Miaofenglou, who were lured to Room 314 of the New World Hotel on the night of October 21st and robbed of jewelry and clothing worth a total of 131 yuan. The other four cases involved</p>
<p>Residential homes of residents. (1) Chuan Jincai's home at No. 114 Baike Road was robbed on October 13th of ornaments and currency worth 888 yuan.

(4) Cheng Baishun's home at No. 493 North Zhejiang Road was robbed of 116 yuan worth of property. The cases have been prosecuted in the Special District Court.</p>
<p>After repeated trials, the arrest of the accomplices was kept secret. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi held a hearing, first interrogating Jia Baoyu and Ye Feilong about the robbery. Only Dong Yushu and Zhang Rongfu were involved in this case, so only those two thieves were brought to court. The patrol's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the stolen goods from the victims had been recovered from a pawnshop on Alabaster Road. Subsequently,</p>
<p>The two prostitutes recounted the robbery situation. They said that they received a slip signed "Zhang" that evening at about 11:00 PM and went to the Oriental Hotel, where they did not recognize any of the three men in the room. They now recognized the two defendants as being among the three. Zhang Rongfu held a handgun, and the other two first robbed Jia Baoyu's ornaments and then Ye Feilong's ornaments. After the robbery, they ordered</p>
<p>The two prostitutes to sit together on the bed, lowered the curtains, locked the door from the outside, and left. After the description, Judge Wu interrogated the Dong thief, who gave evasive testimony, but the Zhang thief admitted that he and two accomplices committed the robbery. Due to time constraints, the other thieves could not be interrogated one by one and were ordered to be detained separately for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>A Thatched House Fire Burned Down Seven Households</h3>
<p>Two Deaths</p>
<p>Countless Injuries</p>
<p>The residents of the bungalow at No. 29 Yuanxing Lane, Shanghai Military Camp, South City, are all struggling to make a living. The sub-landlord of the house is Cao Ji, an old woman from Tongzhou, 59 years old, with a son named Denian, 31 years old, who is married to Zhuang, 25 years old. The loft of the house is rented to Li Changzhou from Yancheng, 68 years old, who makes a living as a vendor and has a smoking habit. His wife, Wang, is 55 years old. The room behind Cao's room is rented to Chen Jinshan from Tongzhou, 39 years old, with a son named Yuetao, 10 years old, and Ji Busheng from Yancheng, 50 years old, whose wife, Zhao, is the same age as Ji, with a son of 7 years and a daughter of 10 years, as well as fellow villagers Chen Lianyuan, 66 years old, Wan Xinpu, 43 years old, and an 80-year-old man, Mr. Jia, all living together in a narrow one-thatched bungalow, a total of seven households. The population is large, and the indoor beds are connected, barely enough space to kneel. At 11:40 PM the night before last, smoke suddenly meandered out of the house, and soon fierce flames soared, and the fire immediately broke through the roof. The Fire Joint Association was notified and immediately sounded the alarm, and fire associations from various districts rushed to the rescue in pump trucks. The fire was extinguished shortly after, only destroying one bungalow, without affecting the rest. When the fire broke out, all the old and young people in the household were sound asleep. When they felt the heat was excessive, they were awakened from their dreams and found that the room was full of fire, which was beyond control. Everyone desperately fled, but they were burned by the fire, with scorched heads and faces, cracked skin, and bleeding. The 21st guard post guard, Ma Zhuxuan, arrived at the scene and immediately sent the injured to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Among them, Li Changzhou, Cao Dechang, and Chen Jinshan suffered minor injuries, while Cao Ji, Cao Zhuang, Chen Lianyuan, Wan Xinpu, Ji Busheng, Ji Zhao, and their children were seriously injured, and their lives were in danger. Chen Yuetao and the 80-year-old man died shortly after due to severe injuries and burns all over their bodies. Afterwards, Police Officer Ma brought the sub-landlord of the house, Cao Dechang, and Li Changzhou back to the 1st District, 1st Precinct. During the preliminary interrogation by the precinct chief, Cao stated that Li had a smoking habit and only went to sleep late at night every night. The cause of the fire was likely caused by him. When questioned, Li Changzhou gave evasive testimony and refused to admit it. As the matter involved a fire and caused death, the precinct chief ordered the local land officer to report to the Shanghai District Court for an examination.</p>

<h3>Husband Joins the Army, Wife Has an Affair</h3>
<p>The Mother Interferes and Dares to Act Fiercely</p>
<p>Adulterer and Adulteress Both Taken to Court</p>
<p>Zhang, a 30-year-old woman from Hubei, daughter of Zhang Lu, an old woman residing at No. 186 Dalin Road, Xiaoximen, married Zhang Xiaoyun at the age of 18. Xiaoyun recently joined the army and has not yet returned home. Before his departure, he entrusted his wife to his mother-in-law to take care of. Unexpectedly, his daughter could not bear the loneliness. When the mother returned to her hometown in April of this year, no one was in charge at home, so she committed adultery with Peng Xingtai, a fellow villager. They were so bold that they acted shamelessly at home, looking like a real husband and wife. After Zhang Lu returned home, she witnessed the situation and feared that her son-in-law would cause trouble when he returned. She admonished her daughter, but she did not listen. Zhang Lu then evicted the guest yesterday, but her daughter protected her lover and beat her mother. Zhang Lu angrily called the police and arrested Peng and her daughter and brought them to the Second District Police Station, and then transferred them to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Ups and Downs of a Mute Lover</h3>
<p>The case of the mute lover, Wu Aizhen, has been widely publicized for a long time. In order to solve the problem of livelihood, they not only devoted themselves to film production and made a film, but also personally appeared on stage to tell their story. People in society generally believe that the incident is over and there are no more twists and turns. Unexpectedly, recently Wu's stepmother, Wu Yang, and her brother, Wu Baolun, filed a lawsuit in the District Court, saying that the content of the film depicts their mother and brother as abusive, which is not consistent with the facts. They have hired a lawyer to request the banning of the film, claiming that it is detrimental to the reputation of the family. Chief Prosecutor Liu Maochu believes that the situation of the mute lover is pitiful, and the law cannot accept this case. A transcript of his original approval is as follows: "The petition is noted. The criminal law is used to punish crimes, not to prevent them from happening. Simply banning the play is a matter of administrative scope. If the civilians must resort to law for damage to reputation, they should go to the competent court and request it according to law." It is said that Prosecutor Xie has been a professor at various universities in Beiping and Guangzhou for many years, and most of the current judges in the South are his students. He is rich in talent for judging cases. Those who do not understand the procedures are given guidance, and those who have been judged by him are convinced. The mute lover's life palace has many capricorns. Now her stepmother is presenting a petition to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that this film be banned. In the future, there will inevitably be some procedures in the Special District Court.</p>

<h3>Suspicious Men and Women in a Bungalow</h3>

<p>Together They Are Taken to the Police Station for Questioning</p>
<p>Gu Ar Er from Wuxi has been managing the cemetery for foreigners at the Lujiazui Cemetery Wharf in Pudong for many years, so there are two bungalows nearby, where Gu lives. However, recently, indecent men and women have been entering and leaving the residence, which has attracted the attention of others, but Gu is unaware of it. Recently, the police officers of the Fourth Squadron became suspicious and entered the house for investigation yesterday afternoon. They saw that in addition to Gu, there was another man and two women. When questioned, their words were inconsistent. They brought the two men and two women to the team together. After questioning by the captain, Gu confessed that one of the two women was his wife and there was nothing else. Another man confessed that his name was Xu Hailin, 35 years old, a local, living at No. 73 Hefeng Lane, Lujiazui, and was a friend of Gu. According to the two women, one was Wang Arlin, 23 years old, from Wuxi, and had been acquainted with Gu for many days, but had not yet formally married. The other was Chen Yuezhu, 25 years old, from Ningbo, living on Huishan Road in the British Concession, whose husband's name was Ding Acai, who runs a blacksmith shop in the Xi Hai Temple, and she and Wang Arlin were sisters and had come to Pu to play today. The captain pointed out that Gu claimed Wang Arlin was his wife, while Wang claimed she was his concubine, so the statements were obviously false. Seeing their behavior, it seemed that they were secretly involved in prostitution, and he ordered that the group be taken to the Third District for questioning.</p>

<h3>Murderous Robbers Convicted</h3>
<p>Cai Wencai Detained for Five Years and Deported</p>
<p>Ma Alai, a native of Shaoxing residing at No. 179 Guoqing Road, Zhabei, went to a place opened by a certain Xi Zuo on Pierson Road in the French Concession on August 24 this year to collect account funds. He then went to Chen Jifu, a friend on the overpass at No. 287 West Xinqiao Street (ie, Baliqiao Road), to smoke. As soon as he sat down, several robbers suddenly came to rob and failed. They opened fire and shot Ma in the waist, causing fatal death. The news has been reported earlier. Detectives Li Liansheng and Liu Kunbao, and detectives Zhang Wenliang, etc., from the French Concession patrol, learned of this, and arrested the robber Cai Wencai, suspects Ma Ada, Zhang Jingfang, and other three people, and brought them to the patrol. Yesterday, they were sent to the French Concession Court for investigation. First, the wife of the deceased, Ma Di, complained that her husband had been shot to death and requested justice. When questioned, Cai Wencai confessed that Wu Linlong, who was on the run, had instigated the crime and asked him to borrow a handgun from the car driver Gu Afu. He returned to the place to rob, and because the deceased refused to hand over the banknotes, Wu opened fire, injuring and killing the deceased. It is now unknown where Wu is on the run. Ma Ada and Zhang Jingfang also confessed that although they knew Cai Wencai, they did not dare to collude in the robbery. Chinese and Western officials sentenced Cai Wencai to be detained in the West Prison for five years and deported, and sent him to the mainland authorities for interrogation. Ma and Zhang were expelled from the concession forever.</p>
<h3>Two Stores Robbed Simultaneously</h3>
<p>At 5:30 PM last night, three or four robbers came to Xinfengsheng Cloth Shop, No. 1 Renshou Lane, South Wuxi Road, Public Concession. Two of them held handguns and first entered the store, ordering everyone to stand up. Seeing the person sitting at the counter, they ordered him to hand over the keys to the safe. Since the store did not have a safe, they searched everyone in the store one by one, totaling two wallets with dozens of yuan in them. They were still not satisfied and then entered the inner room, putting on a coat and a raincoat hung on each friend's hanger. At the same time, two or three people entered the Xintaiheng Cloth Shop across the street. Several customers were in the store, drinking and talking, unaware that the robbers had visited their door. They searched everyone present, taking dozens of yuan and a gold ring from two of the customers. Before leaving, they ordered no one to make a sound and left. By the time the patrol received the information and arrived, they were long gone.</p>
<h3>Robbery Case on Belles Road Solved</h3>
<p>The cigarette paper shop opened by Zhu Zhuming with the signboard "Skinny" at No. 1, Lane 340, Belles Road, French Concession, was suddenly visited by three robbers speaking with a Chongming accent at 8:45 PM the night before last. They jumped into the store on the pretext of buying cigarettes and threatened with a handgun, robbing dozens of yuan from the counter and fleeing with the loot. The victim reported to the patrol, requesting an arrest. Detective Inspector Jin Jiulin, detective captain Li Yaolong, deputy detective captains Qian Yumin, Mao Jingen, Wang Rusong, and detective Zhang Ziying from the special agency learned that the robbers had taken the loot to Room 30 of the Dongxin Hotel, No. 47 Baoyu Lane, to divide it.

<p>The detectives went to Shude Lane and confiscated two handguns, bringing them to the patrol. After questioning by the patrol leader, the bandits admitted to the robbery. It was also found that the bandits had committed robbery cases before and dared to commit them again this time, which was extremely illegal. Moreover, the robbery site was only a block away from the bandit's residence. He ordered them all to be detained and listened to the confession, and sent them to the court for interrogation. At the same time, he praised the detectives for solving the case quickly, which was commendable, and rewarded them in person. The detectives thanked them and left.</p>

<h3>Yangtze River Shipping News</h3>
<p>Sichuan Merchants Detain British Ship: The British-owned, shallow-draft river steamer "Jieding" of Jardine Matheson was attacked by bandits on the Yangtze River at Chenglingji. The ship ran aground while trying to avoid the bullets. The bandits forced the ship to hand over the cargo, and displayed eight red flags on the riverbank to demonstrate and warn the ship. (Hanging eight red flags is the most severe indication by the bandits, meaning the entire ship will be slaughtered.) The shipowner, seeing this, was terrified and ordered all the gauze on board to be thrown into the river, both to satisfy the bandits' demands and to lighten the ship. This matter was reported in this newspaper. Later, the Jieding was rescued by a Japanese warship, and the bandits retreated. The ship was towed out by the company's "Ji'an" and sailed to Chongqing, where it has now arrived. An inspection of the discarded gauze revealed a loss of over 100,000 yuan. Most of this cargo was shipped by various Sichuan merchant guilds in Shanghai, such as Dachuan East and Jardine Matheson Chongqing, and they have all reported the shipment. Now, due to the excessive loss of goods, the various Sichuan merchant guilds have suffered huge losses, and the relevant capital is requesting Jardine Matheson to compensate accordingly. The company has not yet acknowledged this claim, as a detailed report has not yet arrived. The Sichuan merchants believe that this case is of great importance and cannot be delayed. Yesterday, news reached Shanghai that the Jieding had been detained in Chongqing by the Sichuan merchants who suffered losses and was not allowed to sail until the compensation for the discarded cargo was fully paid to each client. Therefore, the ship is blocked in Chongqing and cannot sail.</p>
<p>British Ships Withdrawing Troops: Due to the large number of bandits on the Yangtze River, British ships in Shanghai had requested the British Navy in Hankou to station troops on each ship traveling between Xunyang and Hankou for protection. Recently, the British Far East Fleet has withdrawn the navy stationed on the ships because the Chinese Ministry of the Navy has deployed the "Cheng Sheng" and "Jiang Kun" to the upper reaches to suppress bandits and escort ships. However, the ships sailing upstream will still have twelve soldiers and four machine guns stationed on each ship to protect the Xunyang-Hankou section.</p>
<p>Two Shipping Organizations</p>
<h3>Discussing the Problem of Stewards on Various Ships</h3>
<p>Negotiating Employment Standards</p>
<p>The management of Ewo and Kung Ho Lun Steamships changed, and a dispute arose among the stewards on the ship. It was found that when the former comprador boarded the ship, he brought 25 stewards with him, agreeing that when he relinquished his duties, these 25 stewards would still leave the ship with the comprador, and the new comprador would appoint replacements. Unexpectedly, this time, when the comprador was replaced, these 25 people refused to leave their posts, leading to a dispute. In order to prevent similar incidents from happening again, the Seamen's Union found it very difficult to handle, so it notified various shipping companies the day before yesterday to send representatives to the Shipping Association to discuss the employment and dismissal methods of cabin stewards on Jianghai ships, so that there would be no more entanglements like those on the Kung Ho Lun. The Seamen's Union sent Lu Rongzhi and Tang Hesheng as representatives, and various shipping companies also sent responsible personnel. The Shipping Association nominated Yu Qiaqing and Chen Bogang, etc., to attend. First, Lu and others put forward opinions on how the stewards of various ships should be employed in the future, so that there would be a standard, so as to avoid problems during the transition between the old and the new, and even extreme conflicts, which have been seen many times. As a result of the discussion among the representatives, some advocated that the comprador should employ 30% of the stewards used on each ship, and the remaining 70% should be introduced by the association. There were also those who advocated that the comprador should employ 20%. After more than an hour of negotiation, no result was reached. It was only agreed that the Seamen's Union should first conduct a field survey of the current number of stewards on each ship and the number of people employed by the comprador on various Chinese ships (including Jianghai routes), and then submit it to the association for a compromise solution to determine the standard for hiring stewards and stipulate the number of stewards employed by the comprador.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhenhua Telegraphs the Red Cross Seeking Relief</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram yesterday from Supervisor Liu Zhenhua from Henan, requesting relief for the province. The original telegram stated: "The disaster in Henan is extremely serious, and the people are unable to live. I have telegraphed requesting a large sum of money to be sent for urgent relief. I hope you will consider that I, Zhenhua, have returned to Henan from Beijing and have personally visited the disaster area. Most of the people are displaced, and the villages have been reduced to ruins. The cries of the hungry are everywhere, and there are bodies on the roads. All these sights are heartbreaking. Now it is winter, and the ground is covered with snow. Those who survived the disaster are suffering from cold and hunger. If we do not provide urgent relief, they will all fill the ditches. I am making another appeal, hoping that you will raise a large sum of money as soon as possible and allocate it quickly. This is what the 20 million people of Henan are weeping for day and night. I respectfully request your kind attention, Liu Zhenhua bows in Yang."</p>

<h3>Jishenghui's Good Medicine Benefits the World</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jishenghui believes that Chinese women often do not express their worries, sadness, anger, and resentment, so they are prone to chest tightness, abdominal distension, menstrual disorders, and other symptoms, and their physical fitness gradually declines as a result. Moreover, due to the lack of prenatal education, the fetus is often affected. Women are the mothers of future citizens. The weakness of women affects the entire nation, and the relationship to the future of society is very important. In a few decades, the physical fitness of the nation may become weaker. The members of the association, seeing this, have specially made a kind of Jisheng Desheng Dan (Pill for Obtaining Life and Benefiting the World). Anyone who takes it can calm the liver, soothe the qi, nourish the blood, and regulate menstruation. It can be taken regardless of pre-pregnancy, postpartum, menopause, blood loss, or irregular periods. Since it was distributed, those who asked for it followed one after another. Poor women who have the above symptoms and cannot afford medical treatment can ask the association for it to take, without taking a penny, to relieve their suffering.</p>

More than half have already been submitted. Those who have not yet submitted them have been issued a notice by the association's Shanghai South Office, urging them to do so.

Yesterday, from morning to night, the office received the aforementioned treasury receipts from various roads in Shanghai and Zhoujiadu, Lan Nidu, Lujiazai, Yangjiazai, Dongjiadu, Tangqiao, Laobaidu, and Bailianjing in Pudong, requesting them to be collected on their behalf.

These companies also handed over their licenses to the office to collect the treasury receipts on their behalf. The office also sent a letter to the Jiangsu Second District Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office yesterday, because it had recently received reports from members: "Dear Sirs, recently, many members have reported to the association that when donating and receiving licenses in winter, an 8% tariff short-term treasury bill is levied. After your association negotiated with the tax office and obtained consent, the association will collect them on behalf of the association and exchange them for formal treasury bills. Our firms have already submitted the treasury receipts they have received to your association. However, recently, tax collectors from the tax office have come to the store and claimed that this treasury receipt can be returned to the tax office and fully offset when exchanging for a spring license. We are reporting this specifically and requesting that you return it for application upon expiration." According to this, after our association contacted your office and reached a compromise, the reports from the members are true. We are sending this letter for inquiry and hope that you will check and reply soon to dispel doubts and avoid misunderstandings."</p>

<p>Art World</p>
<h3>Recent Impressions of Hua Lin</h3>
<p>A Western philosopher has said, "Man is an artist, and his life is a work of art." A work of art is how each person uses various methods to express their own different world. To know the noblest condition of life is "effort." As I recently had the opportunity to come into contact with the art world in Shanghai, such as the exhibitions of Wang Yachen and Rong Junli, and the exhibition of the Shanghai Art College, it is sufficient to see the efforts of all of you. The day before yesterday, Sunday, in the afternoon, I went to the Shanghai Art College on Jiangwan Road to see their achievements. Downstairs were all the works of the students. Student life is originally naive, innocent, playful, and bold. In the future, it will naturally create capable, intelligent, striving, and brave young writers. Going upstairs, browsing the works of the teachers, such as Zhu Yingpeng's magnificence, Chen Baoyi's elegance, Wang Daoyuan's melancholy, and Ni Yide's interest, the one with the power of pursuit is Zhu Yingpeng, the enjoyer is Chen Baoyi, the tormented is Wang Daoyuan, and the casual one is Ni Yide. The exquisiteness of decorative painting, such as Chen Zhifo, is a person who follows the rules and regulations. It is sufficient to see that in a showroom, the worlds are different. For example, Chen Baoyi and Wang Daoyuan's portraits of two women, one is like a freshly blooming flower, in full bloom, the other is like a remnant of a flower after rain, still emitting a fragrant smile. Ni Yide's portrait of a woman is his lover, and it is appropriate that the weather is clear. Also, Wang Rong and his lover travel in Southern Europe, fully absorbing the scenery of Italy, and copying world-famous works in France, which is also quite enjoyable, unlike my pessimistic world-weariness, where "love and hate" create an unsolvable life.</p>
<h3>Two Genius Youths of Shanghai Art College: Meng Yun</h3>
<p>丨丨Mr. Zeng Zhiliang丨丨Mr. Yang Qiuren</p>
<p>After seeing the achievement exhibition of Shanghai Art College, it is like adding some grape juice and rose syrup to my dry mood.</p>
<p>What I envy most is that Shanghai Art College occupies a suitable school location. Hongkou Park in front, the Sixty-Three Garden on the side, and the green fields of the countryside behind, they are the first to receive the spring breeze, and they are the first to know when the autumn leaves fall. Other things such as the morning sun and evening glow are enough to induce their interest in painting everywhere. The achievement painting exhibition of the art college in recent days has made Jiangwan Road full of artistic atmosphere. Jiangwan Road 丨丨 is really our "Rose Road", and on this "Rose Road", there is a full of desolate, melancholic, gentle, and fresh mood. Painters and poets dominate in this environment, and there should be a revelation of genius and a discovery of emotion. Sure enough, the Art College does have two young painters full of genius. In recent days, newspapers have almost recorded the works of the professors of the school. Now I will introduce two genius painters who deserve our attention.</p>
<p>The first one is Mr. Zeng Zhiliang. His works are a bit similar to those of Mr. Ni Yide. Everywhere his brush touches, it makes us feel like we have taken a stimulant. That kind of strong and powerful appearance truly expresses the revolutionary spirit of our country's modern era. I know that this genius painter must be a "hot youth." This time, he only produced a few pieces. One of them is a "nude woman" lying on a sofa, and he also slightly changed his style. The richness of the color, the ingenuity of the composition, and the delicacy of the brushstrokes, show the gentle atmosphere of the room and the quiet mood of the girl. It is really a work that adds color to the painting exhibition. The second one is Mr. Yang Qiuren. He has more works than Mr. Zeng Zhiliang. It is a pity that most of them are small landscape paintings based on copied drafts, which do not express his personality, and copied paintings always lose the natural air of spatial art. However, he has a glossy color, which is enough for us to appreciate.</p>
<p>Therefore, in our lonely art world, we need these great Anson. I pray here, wishing them to continue their research with consistent efforts. At the same time, I would also like to congratulate Mr. Wang Daoyuan, Ni Yide, Chen Baoyi, and Zhu Yinglin, congratulating them on their effective teaching, which can create these two genius painters.</p>
<h3>Japanese Imperial Exhibition of Western Painting Tour: Japanese Correspondence by Xie Haiyan</h3>
<p>(Continued from the third part)</p>
<p>After saying so much in one breath, I still feel like I have so much to say, but due to time constraints, I have to quickly introduce all the works seen in this Imperial Exhibition that are worth discussing.</p>
<p>At the very beginning, there was Mr. Kita Renzo's "Magnolia." The first impression gave me an unpleasant feeling. The bowl-sized flowers and palm-sized leaves, in that kind of pretentious and dazzling technique, simply cannot extract any elements of painting beauty. Therefore, rather than saying that this is a painting, it is better to say that it is a piece of Xiang embroidery.</p>
<p>Next, there is Mr. Nakamura Kenichi's "Brothers and Sisters Gathering," a specially selected masterpiece that won this year's Imperial Art Academy Award. Indeed, in the venue, this painting can be called the queen of exceptional works. Just the huge canvas and the several dignified figures are enough to capture the admiring gaze of the general public. Although there is nothing to criticize in the composition of the painting and the coordination of colors, the sitting figures and the dancing figures in the upper right corner all face the same direction, like when taking a photo, everyone is looking at the camera at the same time, the scene of stillness. This shortcoming has added a lot of stains to this painting.</p>
<p>Again, there is Mr. Nakayama Masami's "Mother and Child Portrait," breaking the traditional literary model, erecting the bridge of self, and reaching the looking-glass ground of illusion. It is a pity that the concept of space is too shallow, and the colors are separated from the picture, giving a sense of incompatibility.</p>
<p>Mr. Suzuki Makoto's "Letre Grazje (Three Goddesses)" has many contradictions. The biggest problem is that the good tone of the lower part lacks uniformity and has no effect of returning to the source.</p>
<p>Mr. Nagaya Isamu's "Lakeside" depicts a large group of nude women resting by the lake. Similarly, it lacks the effect of returning to the source and organic combination, as if cutting and pasting nude women one by one from human body studies onto a large landscape painting.</p>
<p>Mr. Koyake Gentaro's "Late Spring Leisure" is extremely exquisite. I want to send him a plaque with the four characters "Ingenious Skill Exceeding Nature."</p>
<p>Ms. Watanabe Yuriko's "A Day in the Manor," abandoning the small and grasping the big, is the essence of landscape and figure painting. The author probably pays attention to this point.</p>
<p>Speaking of Mr. Minami Kaoru's "Morning," it is a still and clear waterscape. Several leaves of a water boat float on the lake bank on a refreshing and pleasant morning. 丨Here, we can glimpse the author's elegant attitude and poetic emotion. Mr. Minami is a member of the Japan Watercolor Painting Association, the Hakujitsukai, and the Imperial Art Committee. He has made outstanding contributions to the Japanese art world in its early stages. At that time, it was the rampant era of the fat school (different from the Togo school丨the founder of the Taiheiyo Painting Society) and the purple school (the Shirabakai school丨the predecessor of the Kofukai) confronting each other. Even the writers of the general official school were still holding on to the classical dogmas in their dreams, on the one hand, following the realist school, and on the other hand, imitating the chaotic era of the romantic school. After returning to China, Mr. Minami immediately devoted himself to reforming the joint movement, and with Mr. Arishima Ikuma (member of the Nikakai) and others, founded the art magazine "Shirakaba," infusing the new tide of thought from the West and smashing the copied photographic versions of the works of Cezanne, Ganguin, Gogh, and Matisse, giving the youth who were burning with new knowledge a great influence. At the same time, his soft works full of poetry were able to harden and lead the eyes of the public, who were accustomed to seeing the works of the Shirabakai and other schools, to another different realm.</p>
<p>What makes people regret is seeing Mr. Wada Sanzo's "Portrait of Grandma." Mr. Wada is a lucky genius in the Japanese art world. His famous work "South Wind" was exhibited at the first Bunten exhibition and shocked the entire Japanese art world, and he was praised as a maverick, so he was called the unicorn son. Later, the government specially sent him to France to study, but the result was disappointing. Since returning to China, in addition to occupying a seat in a corner of the Imperial Exhibition every year and hanging his perfunctory and meaningless small works of Academy, he has done nothing. Recently, I heard that he has gone to Shizuoka Prefecture to study dyeing crafts.</p>
<p>Mr. Kusaka Mitsunari's "Front Garden" is a charm that reveals a special kind of nerve, capturing a realm of poetic dreams, indicating to people a mysterious and sweet comfort.</p>
<p>Mr. Yanagiya Kunishiro, an old general in the Japanese art world, painted "Morning" with oil paints, or rather, it should be called an oil-painted decorative painting. Once this name is determined, the evaluation will not be without clues. The lead-colored curtain and the yellow human body reflect the color-coordinated scales, playing the pure rhyme of a misty and happy life. In the sweet and refreshing morning, recalling the sweet and refreshing dream, this old man almost does not need me to introduce him again. He is a famous mainstay of the old fat school. When he went to Europe for the second time more than twenty years ago, he was baptized by the Fauves, but he did not become a loyal successor to the Fauves. At present, due to the compromise of the environment, the ashes of the dead Academy's stench have been rekindled imperceptibly. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>Change, by Tang Zengyi</h3>
<p>By Li Zanhua</p>
<p>Avant-Garde Monthly, Issue 2</p>
<p>Since the launch of the Nationalist Literary Movement, after the demise of Proletarian Literature this year, the speed at which it has progressed is unimaginable to the general researcher of literature and art. Because this movement with great significance is based on historical determination, the needs of objective society, and the theory of correct central ideas, it has caused a sensation in the domestic and foreign literary circles in the shortest period of time. This is an undeniable fact. Among the publications issued in this great and profound movement, what makes us most concerned is of course the "Avant-Garde Monthly" that suddenly emerged after the sensational Avant-Garde Weekly. In China, it can be said to be the only large publication that focuses on theory. Its serious attitude, rich content, and precise material selection are unprecedented in the domestic magazine industry. In particular, it is extremely cautious about the selection of creations. In this way, it will not fall into the recent practice of major publications indiscriminately selecting creations. The editor's precise vision and strict attitude are worthy of our attention. Therefore, although the short creations published in the "Avant-Garde Monthly" are very few in terms of quantity, they grasp the highest peak of creation in terms of quality. This alone can determine a glimpse of its artistic value.</p>
<p>In this issue, there is only one creation, "Change" by Zanhua. This describes the changes in the Chinese countryside, with strong local colors. The contradictions expressed in this era are even more detailed and gratifying. The content of the story he wrote is like this:</p>
<p>The protagonist, Lamei Anniang, is a typical woman in the Chinese countryside. Her only hope in her life is the pig she raises in her family's pen. This history full of nationalism and local colors should be portrayed now. The author grasps this center of gravity and expands and describes it in an orderly manner from the most subtle points. At the beginning, the author brings the personality of the characters that should be expressed to life before our eyes. For example:</p>
<p>Lamei Anniang's pig is so fat and tall that it often provokes Lamei Anniang's smile. This smile is not very common in Meijiazhuang, which is more than ten miles around. When the years are bad, everyone only frowns. People who frown rarely laugh themselves, let alone want to see others laugh. Lamei Anniang understands the situation of the villagers very well, so she quickly restrains her smile and stares at the pig, calculating secretly that at the end of the year, this will be another sum of money to pay off the debt of Meidaye, make a new dress for Little Lamei, and buy a little pig with the surplus money. Next year, it will be so tall and so fat again. In this way, year after year, it will not be difficult to win a breath for the dead ghost Lamei Master. These hopes are all on the pig. The pig does not answer, but it is very affectionate around her knees. It seems that it will not fail her this hope. Joy occupies her heart again, and the waves of smile spread across her thin face involuntarily.</p>
<p>There are many such expressions that are tight and powerful. The author's writing about the psychology of rural women is quite delicate, which is also the author's most special point. However, it is impossible for Lamei Anniang to pass by peacefully like this in the real countryside. Therefore, after this day, the air in Meijiazhuang, which was said to be extremely peaceful, suddenly became tense. Of course, it is impossible to avoid the disturbances of the Communist Party in the countryside. Such inhuman and terrifying events of course caused Lamei Anniang to feel fear. However, what Lamei Anniang was most worried about was that she had such a pig, so fat and so tall.</p>
<p>Eventually, according to general rumors, "that thing, that very unusual thing" was about to come. Lamei Anniang is a hard-working woman, and there is also a Little Lamei who is only fourteen years old. Hearing that very unusual thing coming, her heart is naturally full of waves of fear. However, Uncle Huizi in the neighborhood is a loyal farmer. He takes care of Lamei Anniang at all times, because it is impossible for that incident to get closer day by day, and for her to quietly guard a fat and tall pig. In the end, Lamei Anniang finally endured the pain and followed everyone away. She only "looked at the pig and cried without being able to bring it up the mountain." This scene of fleeing is worth portraying in depth. At the same time, the author's description of the situation in the countryside is extraordinarily precise in every word and sentence, and it is even more concise and narrated with the most economical means. However, after reading it, we can very thoroughly understand the situation in this countryside. Regarding this, if a person does not have a deep understanding of art, it is impossible to write it so skillfully and uniquely. For example:</p>
<p>The sun shone on her back, and the package was so cumbersome. She was sweating and was gradually moving away from the row in front.</p>
<p>What lay in front was a ridge, so high that it was frightening. Some people were walking on the ridge, and some were falling behind. He remembered this ridge. There was a temple on the ridge, and there was a monk there. The monk used to be so old, and now the scenery does not allow Mian to see him again. Everyone's footsteps were heading in that direction. Maybe they were going to the temple. This tight and economical description is almost all over the article. The writing is both concise and experienced, which makes us pay special attention to it. At the same time, the author's description of the disturbance of the Communist Party is one-sided, but after reading it, we can understand that it is really an inhuman event. "Everyone understood seven points of the situation, so it really came. So, each of them found their own people in the darkness and helped them to walk. Their hearts were flustered and their feet could not be faster. Walking out of the temple gate, Meijiazhuang was a blaze of fire, shining on the sky so red. Everyone was so frightened that they dared not cry out loud." In this way, there is no need to say that it can make us see the inhuman things that the Communist Party was performing there by killing and setting fires. It is not necessary to describe it in a scary manner. The author's profound brushstrokes can be said to be a new idea in the domestic creation industry. At the same time, this kind of brushstroke can better express the extraordinary vividness and deeply touch the hearts of the readers. The author is good at psychological analysis, especially the characters in the countryside. This is what everyone who has read "Change" can know. As for the fluency and simplicity of the dialogue and the compactness and skillfulness of the structure, they are even more unique to the author. Today's general countryside is exactly like this, in a state of change, so works that express the sharp edge of the contradictions of this era are extremely necessary to produce a powerful creation in the Nationalist Literary Movement.</p>
<p>In this great creation, the author has deeply grasped the center of gravity of this era. It can be said that it is a rare and powerful work.</p>
