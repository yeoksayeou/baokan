<p>時評</p>
<h3>甘地非武力進行之困難</h3>
<p>甘地本宗敎捨已救人之誠心。作民族自决獨立之運動而又以百折不回之態度出之。誠爲爲人所不易爲。所慮者發生意外之障礙耳以今日情况觀之有兩端可慮。</p>
<p>一爲由於外部牽涉者。如路礦工潮迭起是也當甘地議决非武力抵抗之初首即嚴禁發生暴舉。謂暴舉最易破壤非武力運動然若遇强大外力之壓迫則羣衆奮鬭憤激之心。一時自難遏抑。故欲避免暴舉實非易事此次甘地之主張開始進行。義務員因與警察衝突。已有人受傷與被拘者甘地之子亦被捕去。此際最易激動民氣。况鐵路工潮未已。而金鑛工人又因與警察衝突有死傷五十人之説。雖此等工潮。起於另一問題。惟旣擴大之後難免不有所牽涉。惹起暴舉。致不能維持甘地之苦心。此則大爲可慮者也一爲由於内部糾紛者。如印回兩敎衝突是也。印度印回兩敎之不相容正與吾前論巴力斯坦回敎中猶回兩派之内訌相同。其不相容之原雖每雖每起於爭宗敎儀式細故。然其實亦含有政治性質。回敎徒因人數較印敎徒少懼將來在政治上被多數之印敎徒壓迫。印敎徒則虞被驅於大回敎主義以是兩敎積不相能。已非一日。近於議决進一步要求完全獨立之初即屢起擊毀敎堂之事。今十葉派敎徒。又發反對甘地主張。表同情於反革命黨而反革命黨又主張先鎭壓敎徒階級爭鬥。由是意見愈深。裂痕愈顯當此工作緊張之際而内部忽有此種情勢。則又爲可慮之一事也。</p>

<h3>蘇民廳呈復</h3>
<p>改組蘇州市政機關</p>
<p>江蘇省政府、於改組蘇州市政機關一案、</p>
<p>前經第二七五次委員會議决、交民政廳核議、現已由胡廳長備文呈復、茲錄原文如下、「案奉鈞府第一三六九號訓令内開、照省政府委員會第二七五次會議、議决、蘇州市政府原則上取消、縮小行政經費、擴大事業費、至接管之機關、與事業之繼續、交民政廳核議等因、合行錄案令仰該廳遵照辦理等因奉此、竊查接管卷内、</p>
<p>蘇州自呈奉建市以還、核其市政府十七年度行政經費、幾佔全市事業費三分之一、與市行政費佔事業費五分之一之原則、大相逕庭、雖疊經令飭緊縮、未見切實遵行、由是新興建設、進展濡滯、固有事業費、挹注維艱、日議羅掘苛細、致市民交相責難、此皆原有組織範圍市内與經濟實况兩不相副、有以使然、改弦更張、本已刻不容緩、最近立法院鑒於過去市制精神未符地方實際、另定原則草案、從事修正、其第四條設置乙種市之條件、（</p>
<p>一）人口在三十萬以上者、（二）在政治上經濟上或國防上有特殊情形者、（三）營業税。牌照費·土地税·每年之收入、占該市財政收入總額二分之一者、今核諸蘇市人口僅二十六萬有奇、民元省會移設、</p>
<p>於政治經濟·國防諸端、尤少特殊情形、</p>
<p>營業·土地·兩税尙未開辦、牌照費更不入該市主管、是蘇州市在新原則上、復失乙種市之條件、此次鈞府委員會議議决該市市政府原則上取消、洵屬至當、惟</p>
<p>蘇州之市政府應行取消、蘇州之市政、則不可一日或輟、謹按市組織原則草案、於甲乙兩種市外、本有丙種市之規定、丙種市設市公所、其下設局或科、市長荐任或委任、市公所内設市參事會、此項原則、</p>
<p>與鈞府令旨最相適合、職廳擬請於蘇州市逕改設蘇州市公所、接管原有市政府機關、組織務求簡當、行政經費務求縮小</p>
<p>、擴大事業經費、繼續辦理、以蘇州市地位而論、市長待遇、擬請荐任、並仍屬於省政府、以職廳爲主管機關、至市公所之内部組織、一俟本案核准後、再由職廳另案擬訂呈核、」</p>

<p>押解赴梧、交第八路軍支配、查三月份軍餉、至今尙欠三十五萬、至各機關二月份經費、延至本月初旬尙未清發、大約中旬乃能將二月份行政經費發清、日前財廳所發軍需庫劵、最近已銷出二百五十四萬元、尙餘一百四十六萬、刻正在推銷中、想一月後或能銷竣、此外税則委員會近又議决舉辦八項特税、以增庫收、查去年七月間、該會曾議决今年二月間將全省釐金完全裁去、同時舉辦植木牲畜紙類礦産黃豆棉花類皮毛類錫箔類等特種消費税、本月一日、該會開第三十九次會議、當即議决舉辦、下次會議再行討論調查辦法、俟調查清楚、然後討論税率、决定税率後即行擬訂徵收章程、將來開徵、</p>
<p>在政府方面預算收入、足以抵償裁去之釐金、至桂省財政、自省内戰事發生後、</p>
<p>財政陷入僵境、從前梧州一隅、爲全桂財富集中地、内地各屬俱贫瘠之區、兩年以來、兵戈不息、地方財政等於司農仰屋、</p>
<p>商務頽傾、收入夾源自然斷絕、而昔日所稱比較富庶之梧州、則刻下尙在軍事範圍、梧人所受桂紙幣損失、尤痛創巨深、</p>
<p>該項桂幣、前數年由桂政府發行、幾及千萬、迨黄紹雄等失敗後、政府塌臺、桂幣遂無保障、初則跌至三成、迄今更成廢</p>
<p>紙、現在梧州總商會封存此項桂紙幣、尙有三百二十餘萬、梧商與桂人遭此巨大損失、梧市商務遂一落千丈、倒閉者不可勝數、最近中央委派之梧州財政處長梁萼聯、爲維持該項廢幣計、經已擬定辦法、酌量施行、惟查南寗柳州方面、李黄</p>
<p>等仍源源濫發此項紙幣、難保不免混入梧州、若然則此方維持、彼方濫發、效果必等於零、故最近爲防止對方濫發之紙幣混入梧市起見、特由財政處通告梧市人民、將前存之紙幣、携赴商會登記轉存、以便着手設法維持焉、（四月四日）</p>

<h3>上海榮得全國足球錦標</h3>
<p>昨日以十比一大勝南京</p>
<p>寗先開紀錄全隊不聯絡</p>
<p>兩隊自參戰全國足球錦標以來、雙方自初賽而次賽、由次賽而復賽、攻無不克、戰無不勝、昨日二時起、雙方會師於足球塲、各以極精鋭之陣線出戰、上海健兒、智勇兼備、賴其傳遞如梭之前鋒、銅墻鐵壁之後衛、跑旣快、踼尤快、結果奪得錦標、南京健兒、始終如一、不屈不撓、作戰雖敗、實因實力不敵、非戰之罪也、望南京隊努力前途、勝負兵家常事耳、</p>
<p>兩隊球藝</p>
<p>上海隊前鋒、皆體格壯健、勇冠三軍、全隊優點、</p>
<p>在能打成一片出全力合作、不存私心、彼此善於聯絡、其傳球·頂球·盤球·截球·射擊、均有獨到之處、南京隊最大通病、爲全隊成一盤散沙、殊無抵愈能力、各個人祇知盤球、不明合作與傳遞、且全隊多用遠交、絕少短兵相接、想係因滬隊壓擊過甚之故、然勇往直前、不存畏縮之心、此實該隊之最優點、祇此一端、苟能與以長期之訓練、尙不難成一勁旅也、</p>
<p>個人技術</p>
<p>上海隊中堅孫恩敬把關截敵使人望而却走、穏若槃石、萬無一失、可謂全隊之砥柱、中鋒戴麟經勇敢敏捷轉身、使頭·用脚·傳遞·接濟·等術、</p>
<p>皆已登堂人室、内鋒陳賢添陳家球二君、足法迥異平常、有神妙之變化、且能審形度勢、利用環境知敵虚弱所在、一挑一撥、均含有藝術意味、</p>
<p>兩翼舉動敏捷、奔跑迅速、惜缺機變之力耳、守衛李寗與陳璞西面鐵門當前、所謂撼山易、撼岳家兵難、餘如莊世鴻等亦均見稱職、無疵可言、</p>
<p>總之上海之妙、妙在個個相似、以上所言、祇不過就昨日表演之成績立誇而已、至於南京隊方面、守門員譚仲章屢救險球、厥功至偉、守衛方法尙佳、時用五人聯時之法、在開賽三十分鐘内、使上海隊不得破門而入、實非易事、餘如顧元亮鍾冠明等、盤球已略窺門徑、惟尙缺機變之力耳、</p>
<p>攝影紀念</p>
<p>開賽前五分鐘、兩隊魚貫入塲、攝影家及各報攝影記者、在塲之中央、請上海隊攝一影、以留紀念、</p>
<p>羣英畢集開賽後、上海隊即取攻勢、前鋒踴躍奔衝、戴麟經陳虞添及陳家球三人、好似無　之馬、東奔西撞、拚命厮殺、無奈南京隊防守森嚴、未能奏效　　一鳴驚人</p>
<p>上海隊未得手、球反爲南京隊所得、一個遠交一左翼劉祖侃盤球直上、至適當地位、向門猛烈射來、球撞左木柱彈進、周賢言至此無法可施、惟有聽其人網、南京隊反先開紀錄、</p>
<p>後生可畏</p>
<p>上海隊旣負一球、五虎乃奪塞而進、南京隊門前、險象横生、戴麟經奚巧生俱有猛烈之射擊、幸守門員譚仲章處置置適當、勞苦功高首推譚君誠後起之秀也、</p>
<p>還敬一只</p>
<p>三十分鐘後、奚巧生在球門區域内得一射門機會、惟舉動過慢爲南京後衛擋出、但又爲莊世鴻所得、傳與陳家球、陳再交與戴、戴得而向門猛射、應聲中的、</p>
<p>十二碼球</p>
<p>此時南京内衛忽在球門區域内犯規、裁判員判罰十二碼、戴麟經一脚踋蹴進、南京隊遂負一球、</p>
<p>再加二個</p>
<p>上海隊自得兩球後氣勢更盛、把南京隊門前、圍得鐵桶相似、卒被戴麟經奚巧生先後射進兩球、</p>
<p>十二碼多</p>
<p>上半時將近、結朿時、戴麟經盤球前進、南京隊内衛出而擋駕、戴乘勢一挑、球觸内衛之手、又罰十二碼、由陳家球主踼未中、已而南京内衛又手觸球、再罰十二碼、又告中的、上半時終局、爲五與一、上海勝、</p>
<p>却斯登舞</p>
<p>下半塲開賽、最初五妥鐘、兩無所獲、俄而戴麟經得球傳與童榮文、童曲折盤上、衝過後衛、一脚踼進、當其進衝時、身體兩面亂搖、頗似却斯登舞、恣勢頗美、</p>
<p>撲地捉球</p>
<p>混戰中温宸茂失足、南京隊前鋒蜂擁過來、上海門前空虚、此時周賢言情急智生、撲地捉球、挽狂　於旣倒、觀衆爲之呌絕、</p>
<p>連中四元</p>
<p>自苻和　得第七球後、上海隊雖隨便應戰、然聲勢並不稍减、陳璞在半塲中得球向右方遠傳過來、奚巧生趕至、一脚命中、俄而奚巧生得球、盤過後衛、一脚傳中、戴麟經伺候門邊不費吹毛之力、頂進一球、最後陳璞在離門的三十碼處得球、遠蹴過來、門撞横木而回、陳家球苻和萓進踪　至、湧進一球、旣而裁判員鳴笛收兵、上海乃以十比一、獲得錦標、</p>
<p>最後佈望</p>
<p>遠東運動會、不久將在日本舉行、選手當不外以上海隊爲基本、望上海隊在最近一月内、努力練習、赴彼東灜、奪取錦標、爲國爭光、保存我國足球上數年來之名舉、記者有厚望焉、</p>

<h3>香港獲錦標</h3>
<p>昨以四比二勝天律龍虎相門之港津棒球决賽、昨日二時舉行、雙方均有精彩、其初港首開紀錄、繼津以二比一占勝、第八局港大轉機、反以四比二得勝、得大會棒球錦標、榮哉港地健兒、不負此行矣、裁判張國勲司壘吳邦偉馬巽、紀分黎賽駿、</p>
<p>雙打殺救險</p>
<p>首先擊球者香港、天津投手顯出球、曲折有力香港三人、乃相迫下塲、繼輪天津、第一鮑文沛、三球落伍、第二張景廉、先進一壘、繼之者林榮彬、</p>
<p>擊球未遠、被投手拾得、傳交二壘、先張到壘、又反傳與一壘、而林榮彬亦因此出塲、香港幸而有上雙打殺一舉、致挽回危局、</p>
<p>安打獲一分</p>
<p>香港陳倫英乘對方一壘之錯話、占據一壘、未幾偷占二壘、陳宇鈿加以臂助、擊開之球、平地向右流去、陳倫英得以奔越三壘、歸回本壘、香港遂首開紀錄、而陳宇鈿亦占在三壘之上矣、陳宇鈿不幸於偷壘之時、被人所殺、香港進展之機會爲之减少焉、</p>
<p>相持成均勢</p>
<p>第三局開始雙方意志鎭定、陣線嚴密、間有人占得一二壘者、終見其半途出塲、期收全功、此局結果、無有出入、</p>
<p>天津占優勢</p>
<p>第四局天津胡振聲一記安打、登一壘、香港投手失去表的、投擲不準、接　四球三次、天津遂得全軍入侵、滿占三壘、胡之首先歸壘、得力於羅　隆之安打、而顧得剛之歸、則不得不謝對方投手之四球、自此天津以二比一反勝香港矣、</p>
<p>香港又遇險</p>
<p>天津投手、表演甚佳、香港諸擊者、幾難越雷池半步、同時香港投手、未見盡職、在此第五局中、</p>
<p>又見四球三次、金剛鑽送上、滿見津地好手、分占各壘、形勢嚴重、空氣緊張、香港當此千鈞一髮之際、幸能處之得當化險爲夷、</p>
<p>勝負之關鍵</p>
<p>第六局平安剮去、無甚變化、第七局、香港陳倫英陳瓊仁各一安打、塲中三壘、均被香港所占雄心勃勃、大有轉機、不料又功虧一簣、良好機會、</p>
<p>頓成過眼烟雲、</p>
<p>香港忽轉機</p>
<p>第七局香港投手鄭瓊仁與二壘陳倫英、互相交替、頗有成効、此局各無所得、第八局香港忽而轉機、梁灼全一下安打、頓時各壘有人、展轉而回者三人、局勢反佳、第九局天津努力反攻、未有若何成績、香港遂以四比二獲得大會錦標、</p>

<p>銀笛聲起、兩隊開始接觸、互運用其五人聯防功夫、相持約一分鐘、卒由天津右鋒唐寳琨遠射中一球、鼓掌聲中首開紀錄、未幾中鋒劉建常又攻入一球、成四比零、天津勝、北平隊見敵人勢鋭、</p>
<p>即忙宣告休息、以避其鋒、但繼續作戰後、仍是天津佔優、五人合作如生龍活虎、確是眞實本領、北平隊雖亦不弱、但合作未盡佳妙、擲籃亦欠準確、且微現慌忙、所謂棋高一着、縛手縛脚、紀錄亦由四對零而成十對三、北平努力反攻、卒歸無効、上半時成績爲二十三對十四、天湋勝、</p>
<p>二次努力</p>
<p>休息後再戰、天津隊李清安登塲、易右鋒唐寳琨作戰、是時北平個個拚命、連績由中鋒王玉清内衛趙久選攻進二球、聲勢甚盛、天津遂宣告休息　　廣東排球隊</p>
<p>王開攝</p>
<p>、並以魏蓬雲代姚恩漢、唐寳琨代李清安、陣線佈置旣妥、開始以巧妙方法作戰、果然大見功效、北平復一蹶不振、其後天津隊柱石唐寳琨因犯規四次出塲、姚恩漢代戰、是時紀錄已成四十四對三十三、勝利已定、天津遂改攻爲守、故意延長時間、北平無法可施、最後天津又擲入一球、</p>
<p>下半時成績爲二十三對十九、天津總分爲四十六對三十三、天津戰敗北平、奪得今日之决賽權、男籃球錦標已有百分六十之希望、</p>

<p>雙方實力平均異常　力</p>
<p>昨日下午二時半、男子籃球繼天津與北平作戰者、爲上海隊與香港隊、香港前日克服神户、其活潑敏捷、已爲一般人所共賞、昨日之戰更能善爲運用、險將戎馬半生之上海隊打倒、前半時之成績、爲二十六對十九、香港大勝、後半時接觸開始、上海始恢復其平日固有實力、着力反攻、</p>
<p>港隊以迭次易人、精神渙散、益之擲籃命軍不佳、數次機會坐祝失去、同時滬隊陸鍾恩何通見情形緊急、亦大實力氣、紀錄由十九對二十六、</p>
<p>而二十一對二十六、二十三對二十六、二十五對二十六、港隊七分鐘無紀錄、陣線亦因之凌亂不堪、兩隧相差　一分、接戰益爲激烈、第八分鐘時、黄運利攻進一球、成二十七對二十六、追出香港一分、然港隊毫不氣　、反攻益力、最後五分鐘時、兩隊分數互有消長、觀衆興奮、亦逹於極點、至尙餘兩分鐘時、紀錄爲四十七對四十一、滬勝、至是滬改守勢、港隊傾國而來、時時進逼、在籃下機會至四五次之多、但均不幸偏向籃外、或在鐵圏邊上躍出、始終未得分數、否則上海殆矣、至最後數秒時、港始攻進一球、總分成四十七對四十五、上海勝、而比賽亦同時告終、</p>
<p>下半時成績二十八對十七、滬隊勝、獲得决賽權、將於今日與天津隊一决雌雄、爭奪錦標、就昨日滬隊球藝而言、對合作及擲籃準確功夫、較津隊似稍弱、非特别努力、希望殊少也、</p>

<p>各隊分數</p>
<p>香港十七分</p>
<p>遼寗十三分</p>
<p>廣東　二分</p>
<p>前日天雨、游泳複賽、亦延至昨日舉行、上午雖天雨、至飯後即放晴、故照秩序舉行、順利無阻、</p>
<p>觀者仍極擁擠、遼寗因希望頗大、故男女啦啦隊前來助威打氣、精神頗佳、池之四週、山上樹下、</p>
<p>俱見人頭攅動、盛極一時、</p>
<p>健兒不怕冷</p>
<p>昨日因天雨之故、池水較寒、初來時、因山上人數尙稀、頗覺冷靜、因之一見池水、似有畏縮之慨、然經數次試泳、精神頓振、絲毫無怕冷之態、</p>
<p>健兒不怕冷也、</p>
<p>遼寗啦啦隊</p>
<p>遼寗史興隆平地一聲雷、奪得一英里第一、四百四十碼又極有希望、（果得第一）故遼寗選手團特組男女啦啦隊、手持小旗、上綴遼寗二字、半黑半白、頗見心裁别出、女啦啦隊、衣服整齊、各衣外國紅色緣以藍邊之織繩衣、衣色一律、甚覺美麗、</p>
<p>入水眞好看</p>
<p>游泳節目中有人水比賽一項、原定預賽、後因人數過少、亦改决賽、此次不計分數、只備奬品、參加者共六人、香港四遼寗二、初試四種指定没水式、再試四種、自定方式、中以郭鳳宸之各式各樣没水式、爲最受觀者鼓掌讚美、有走而入水者、有接連翻身而没水者、各式不同、亦有奇形奇狀者、男女觀衆、笑不可抑、</p>
<h3>四百四十碼决賽</h3>

<p>第二香港陳其松</p>
<p>第三香港宋耀德</p>
<p>第四無</p>
<p>時間六分三十七秒</p>
<p>四人决賽</p>
<p>四百四十碼自由式决賽、共只四人决賽、故無論如何、每人皆可得分、惜百碼之後陳振興即力乏退出、殊爲可惜、故終賽者共只三人、第四名缺、</p>
<p>遼寗第一</p>
<p>四百四十碼决賽、果然不出觀衆所料、遼寗史興隆游過百碼、即一躍在前、過在三百碼、史興隆與第二名已相差四十碼、及至終店、史興隆遠在第一、</p>
<h3>百碼决賽</h3>

<p>第二遼寗史興賽</p>
<p>第三香港黄烈光</p>
<p>第四香港陳其松</p>
<p>成績　六十四秒五分三</p>
<p>百碼自由式因上海陳金培未出席、只祇五人、遂改决賽、香港隊五人居四、然遼寗史興隆亦因弱者、香港陳振興雖得第一、史興隆則列第二、亦可佩矣、史氏長短距離俱佳、誠爲可造之材、惟長距離、則勝於短距離、百碼游畢、陳振興適已力竭、而史則猶如吃美味、稍　而未大嚼、未曾暢快也、</p>

<p>已有二六八人</p>
<p>全國運動大會、閉幕在邇、近有一部份各省市選手、因競賽已畢、急於返里、自五日起、已先後紛紛離會、茲將五日起至八日止、已離會選手、群爲調查如后、</p>

<h3>花花絮絮</h3>
<p>傾城傾市、昨日除田徑賽塲外、各塲均舉行决賽、精采非凡、杭城全市小學、均放假蒞塲參觀、而士女如雲、塲内擠得水洩不通、歡聲鼎沸、蓋最後决戰數幕、關係甚重、無怪閧動全城市也、</p>
<p>今昔之感、前荗日田徑賽塲、人山人海、最爲閙熱、昨日該塲因無比賽、落寞沉寂、　焉無人、凡由該塲經過者、多不勝今昔之感、</p>
<p>清流濯足、孫桂雲小姐、此次南來露頭角、爲各方視線集中注意、孫小姐因連日大疲倦、昨偕其友王淵小姐等游湖、遍覧蔣莊劉莊三潭印月等名勝、在劉莊遇雨、竟失足隋水、意者豈以其善走·而愛湖水清潔、欲一濯其連日在會塲奔馳所積之　垢歟</p>
<p>拈花含笑、二百四十碼游泳第一大連人史興隆、昨日游泳事畢、觀衆散去、史獨殿後、</p>
<p>時本報記者迎面而來、見其手執鮮花一把、笑容可掬、若不勝其愉快者、其心意甜美、想可知已、</p>
<p>連中三元、昨日下午二時、上海對香港男籃球複賽、塲之東欄、有杭州某女學校學生數人、正引領而觀、精神貫注、詎香港隊之一球、</p>
<p>適墜於該女生頭上、全塲大　、未數分鐘、復運墜兩球、該女生等以頓時面紅耳赤、相率他避、</p>
<p>利市十倍、自大會開幕以來、四方健兒之來杭者、不下三千餘人、大會方面雖關有宿舍、以供健兒住宿、顧以屋少人多、飲食不佳、大都遷地爲良、移住旅館、故日來西子湖頭之大小旅館、莫不生涯鼎盛、利市十倍、然外鄉人素稱杭人善鑤王瓜兒、際此時會、旅館老班圖利起見、不得不向一般外鄉人、大敲其竹槓了、</p>
<p>幸與不幸、昨日下午、足球係南京與上海作最後之决賽觀者滿塲、爲從來所未有、最初上海隊球風不佳、及後轉勢、南京隊連吃兩個十二碼、但第一個十二碼、南京隊守球門者一交跌去、毫無效力、第二個十二碼、則一交跌去、兩脚一仆、兩手棒住、同是十二碼、竟有幸有不幸、</p>
<p>重重包圍、會塲以内上海對國貨機製工廠聯合會、每日在會塲分贈該會編印之機聯會刊、該刊文義淺近、趣味雋永、尤爲一般小學生所歡迎、每次在塲分送、持書之人輒被包圍、行行止止、解脱無從、且多爲活潑潑地之小朋友、又不能拒以詞色、於是進退維谷、行不得也弟弟矣、</p>
<h3>菲人對遠東會錦標之推測　錢一勤譯</h3>
<p>日本將得丨田徑游泳丨網球丨錦標</p>
<p>菲島將得丨籃球丨排球丨丨丨錦標</p>
<p>中國將得丨足球丨丨丨丨丨丨錦標</p>
<p>全能球爲該錦標之關鍵</p>
<p>丨國人聽之丨急宜奮勉丨</p>
<p>是篇爲菲律濱體育恊會名舉幹事伊可乃博七Ｄr·ＲrginoＲ·Ｙtanan所作、原名「吾人在遠東大會之命運」Our　Chances　inThe　Olympi　曾於今歲菲律濱「運動週刊」第三期上發表、其見解頗有獨到處、茲乘全國運動大會在杭舉行之際各方選手　集之秋、亟譯之、藉作他山石語、凡我健兒讀之、當如何努力、如何自勉、</p>
<p>自有遠東運動大會以來、直至一千九百二十一年、凡爲地主之國家每獲大會之錦標、如一九一三年大會在馬尼刺舉行、錦標爲菲所獲、一九一五年在上海舉行、爲中國所獲、一九一七年在大阪舉行、爲日所獲、皆明證也、迨至一九二一及一九二七年大會於上海舉行、先後爲菲日獲勝後、此種順序於是爲之一變、</p>
<p>吾人果欲知菲律濱在下届大會之機會若何、有數種重要之原素、須加以精詳之研究、試分拆之（一）日本之於各種運動之猛進是也、（二）中國國戰爭之延長是也、（三）印度將加入遠東大會是也先試就第一點言之、日本近數年來田徑賽及游泳均有長足之進步、觀其前次於荷蘭阿們司但城舉行之世界夏令比克大會之成績、及去年在東京及滿洲舉行之表演、殊足驚人、平心而論、下届夏令比克游泳一項、可與勁强之美國抗衡者、捨日本而外、恐無他國、網球亦然、其選手曾擊敗世界最良之名手、故今後日本於台維斯杯帶際比賽之實力、較往日爲尤佳、</p>
<p>茲就第二點而言之、每遇大會在他國舉行時、中國從未有全體之代表國出席、今國内戰事、方興未艾、恐不克派遣多數之代表參與、中國之實力悉在國體之競技、其中以足球·籃球·排球爲尤著、前次大會田徑賽及游泳、中國均無地位、就目前成績而論、下届大會中國恐無力分佔日本之分數、其常勝之運動、唯足球一項、至於籃球及排球、勢必與菲盡力角逐、</p>
<p>茲更論第三點、印度之加入大會、必使大會錦標起相當之變化、若印度今年果眞派遣代表前往東京、然其人數必不大、此可斷言、僅就經濟端言之、印度派遣選手赴日與赴　、兩者相較其費用之活大、實無差異、雖然倘印度果派全體代表出席、則對於中日爲有害、而對於菲則反有益、何者、蓋印度之於足球一項、頗爲精强、或能奪得中國之威權、起而代之、亦屬可能之事、其網球選手在國際上、亦有聲　、其長跑家、頗不乏人在、且每於夏令比克大會中奪去日本長距離之分數、</p>
<p>遠東大會總錦標之决定、係根據入項錦標中獲得第一最多者、其計分之方法、爲五·三·一制、</p>
<p>倘遇均等之時、則以分數之最高者爲得勝、按上届大會之結果、及中日菲運動員上季之成績、日本於下届大會又將獲勝田徑賽、網球及游泳、中國將勝足球、菲律濱將得籃球與排球、而棒球及全能運動、將爲决定大會錦標誰屬之最後關鍵、</p>

<h3>全國敎育會議全部方案　（三）</h3>
<p>丙、所需校舍及敎室中設備怎樣籌備、應受補習敎育者、爲二○二、四三五、二七七人、照乙項</p>
<p>加的失學靑年論、那末小學校舍敎室、已日夜人滿、不能再容、假定每敎室容五十人、兩班輪流使用、即每一百人需要一敎室霮敎室數量恰與敎員數十一萬二千四百七十相等、大概單級民衆補習學校、應用兩間空氣光線適度、高低大小適宜的房子、一大間作敎室、一小間作辦事地方、</p>
<p>這是無論如何不可少的、况且敎育部曾頒布　業推廣規程（註三）前大學院也曾通令各省市利用固有機關、團體、興辦民衆敎育（註四）將來勢必把成年補習敎育的校舍、成爲社會改革的中心、那麽、校舍一項、自然也是一個問題、</p>
<p>丁、所需經費怎樣籌措、據調查所得、養成個民衆學較畢業生、至少需費一元四角、（註五）</p>
<p>照此、二億零二百餘萬人所需的成年補習敎育經費要二億八千三百四十餘萬元、師資養成的經費還不在内、這樣鉅大數目、自屬籌措不易、</p>
<p>這是不能不另行設計的、</p>
<p>（四）失學成年人入學補習及　　培養師資辦法</p>
<p>甲、全國不識字而應受補習敎育的人數、估計爲二○二·四三五·二七七人、識字者爲八七·二一八·九九○人、已如上述、只須每人敎二人半就可以完全普及、所以對不識字者、應下强迫令、使他們學習、對於識字者、應下動員令、使他們敎人識字、他們敎人識字的義務、和當兵納税的義務、同一重要、但是要把這二億零二百餘萬個不識字的人、都貢成八千七百餘萬個識字人來平均分配去敎導、事實上是不可能的、所以本計劃是要用班級制的國民識字學校、和非班級制的的國民識字處、來互相調劑、</p>
<p>乙、國民識字學校、和國民識字處、是怎樣的區别呢、家庭·小店舖·及其他小規模組織的集團裹的分子、如有不識字者、可由家内·舖内·或本集團中之識字份子指導、不取班級上課形式、</p>
<p>呌做國民識字處、由附近小學校去考核、每處設處長一人、敎員若干人、就附近小學校校長加聘、國民識字學校·設在軍隊·工廠·監獄·及一切大機關、或有數十以上不識字者的地方、其餘不識字者、不入國民識字學校、便須組織國民識字處</p>
<p>丙、國民識字學校的師資、由縣立高級小學、</p>
<p>縣立師範、省立師範、高中師範科、軍官學校、及中等以上各校、附設班級、招收各本校全體學生、至少加以三星期的訓練、並且招收私塾敎師、加以二個月的訓練、勉可適用、這些師資來源、約計如下（註六）</p>
<p>（一）中等以上學校學生、二十二萬</p>
<p>（二）私塾敎師至少、二十萬</p>
<p>（三）高級小學生、五十八萬</p>
<p>上項、小學敎員不在内、理由見前第三節的乙項、其中、（一）（三）兩項每年有二分之一或三分之一畢業出校、故雖有八十萬人、實際每年祇有五十萬人可當成年補習的敎員、私塾敎師不能全用擇優秀者四分之一、約可得五萬人、兩共五十五萬人、約當前第三節乙項估計的敎員需要數十三萬五千的四倍、儘够輪替、更有下面丁項國民識字的辦法調劑補救、所以無論如何、總可敷用、</p>
<p>丁、國民識字處敎師、由自已家裹、店裹、　關裹的識字份子、充任可分兩種、</p>
<p>（一）小學生七○○○、○○○</p>
<p>（二）識字成人七三○○○、○○○（註七）</p>
<p>上數的合計是八千萬人、起定由這八千萬個敎師、各敎二人、四個月計可敎成一萬六千萬人、</p>
<p>識字處敎師、由小學及改良私塾去訓練、訓練期二個月、這樣辦法、識字者怎麽樣敎、應補習者便怎麽樣學、識字者彷彿與不識字者同受國民訓練、</p>
<p>戊、敎育部設中央國民識字指導員訓練所、拿首都國民識字運動作試騐及訓練中心、招收高中程度以上學生、每年分兩期招生、每次招收八十到一百名、每半年畢業一次、畢業後陸續派赴各省長期指導、並負考核成績的責任、這樣、每半年每省得平均增加專任成年補習敎育責任者三人、六年以後、每省可得三十餘人、將來第二步計劃進行時非常便利、</p>

<p>（五）增加校舍設備的辦法</p>
<p>實施國民識字訓練、所需的校舍、除國民識字處人數不多、較易籌畫牙、其國民識字學校、照第三節丙項估計、每校至少需用房屋二間、除小學校兼用者以外、全國一千九百十五縣、平均每縣要五十八九所、在城市當然可以利用公共機關、</p>
<p>慈善機關、中等以上學校、在鄉村及小鎭却不易設法、凉亭面積雖小、亦可利用、茶店雖有營業關係、亦可商借一二小時、萬不得已、廟塲、空地、在春秋晴天、可設法利用、這是暫時的、一方面儘先在鄉僻地方建築小學校舍、把原來借作校舍的家廟寺廟等讓出、作爲成年補習敎育的塲所、設備也借原有者、若是空房、學生應自帶坐具、此外並可獎勵私有捐助房屋、或捐資建築校舍、或由公家籌欵建築單簡的民衆敎育館、或農民敎育館、兼辦民衆識字敎育、</p>
<p>（六）經費預算及分配</p>
<p>第一經費的預算、上述實施成年補習敎育、所需經費、約爲二億八千三百四十餘萬元、這個數字、是從比例上　算得到的、究竟　　若干、不可不切實估計如左、</p>
<p>實施國民塾字訓練經費預算表</p>
<p>科目經費數</p>
<p>第一欵實施國民識字五六、五八七、四四○</p>
<p>訓練經費元</p>
<p>上列數目、是每年需要數、</p>
<p>第一項印刷費三、七○六、一○○</p>
<p>第一目千字課本一六八、七○</p>
<p>假定每二人合用一本、每本三期輪用二臆二百四十餘萬人、約共需三千三百七十四萬本、每本印費三分、共需一百零一萬二千二百元、分六年、每年約需如上數、</p>
<p>第二目、民衆週刊二、七○○、○○</p>
<p>假定每三十人合用一份、約共需六百七十五萬份、每份每期印費一分、每年四十期、計四角、共需如上數、</p>
<p>第三目、識字國民證書、三三七、四○○</p>
<p>每年訓練三千三百七十四萬人、每人一份、每份一分、合計如上數、</p>
<p>第四目、愛國獎狀、五○○、○○○</p>
<p>根據四節丁項公民識字處敎師可有八千萬人、</p>
<p>假定内中每期有五分之一給奬、應預備奬狀一千六百萬張、每年三期計四千八百萬張、照五千萬張計、每張印費一分、共需如上數、</p>
<p>第二項、文具費二、二五○、○○○</p>
<p>假定每份三班輪用、每年約需一千一百二十五萬、每份二角計、共約需如上數、</p>
<p>第三項、敎師薪水、三三、七四一、○○○</p>
<p>依第三節乙項國民識字學校敎員數、是十一萬二千四百七十人、平均每人每年俸額三百元、共需如上數、</p>
<p>第四項、中央國民識字指、一五、○○○</p>
<p>導員訓練費</p>
<p>第一目、經常費、一○、○○○</p>
<p>照四節戊項計靈辦理每年每生平均訓練費一百元、共需如上數、</p>
<p>第二目、開辦費、五、○○○</p>
<p>開辦費共需三萬元、六年内每年平均需如上數、</p>
<p>第五項、中央國民識字指導、六六○、○○○</p>
<p>員薪水旅費</p>
<p>第一半年無自第一年下半年起一百人、第二年起二百人、第三年下半年起三百人、照此遞加、</p>
<p>每人每月一百元、共計三百九十六萬元、六年、</p>
<p>每年平均如上數、</p>
<p>第六項、各縣市訓練識、一、一四九、○○○</p>
<p>字敎師經費</p>
<p>全國共有一千九百十五縣、以每縣每年六百元計、合需如上數、</p>
<p>第七項、校舍經費、五、六二三、五○○</p>
<p>借用不必開支、惟照義務敎育計畫修理及開辦設備費約每所五百元、桌椅借用或由學生自備、</p>
<p>可減少二百元、以三百元計、十一萬二千四百七十所、共需三三、七四一、○○○元、六年平均分籌每年需如上數、</p>
<p>第八項、維持費雜費、六、七四八、二○○</p>
<p>粉筆·燈火·茶水·辦公用文具等每校每月五元、</p>
<p>每年需如上數、</p>
<p>第九項、預備費、二、六九四、六四○</p>
<p>預備費照上列第一項至第八項總數百分之五計算需如上數、</p>
<p>第二、經費的分配、上項预預算、可算比較確實的數目、（每年每生約需一元六角五分、連師資訓練也在内、與前面第三節丁項估計的一元四角只出入百分之十六）就性質説、旣是充辦理地方國民識字訓練之用、似應由地方負担、不過按照現在地方財力情形、要完全担負此費、事實上絕對不可能、所以由中央及地方分担頂是適宜、</p>
<p>比照常第一章義務敎育例、擬定分担標準如左、</p>
<p>中央、担負全額百分之四十五</p>
<p>省地方、担負全額百分之十</p>
<p>縣地方、担負全額之四十五</p>
<p>依上述標準、得中央及地方所担負總額各如左、</p>
<p>中央、每年應担負、二五·四六四·三四八元</p>
<p>省地方、每年應担負、五·六五八·七四四元</p>
<p>縣地方、每年應担負、二五·四六四·三四八元</p>
<p>合計五六·五八七·四四○元</p>
<p>上項省地方應籌數、除、藏、及綏遠、熱河、察哈爾、寗夏、西康、靑海、等六省、具有特别情形、應另設計外、若由其餘的江蘇等二十二省分攤、計算、每省每年平均約担負二十五萬餘元、又上項縣地方應籌數、姑按全國現有縣市數二千（註八）分攤、每縣每年平均應各籌一萬二千五百餘元、但各縣人口財力環境等、各各不同、那裹能够一律、所以各縣担負數目、又可假定如左表、</p>
<p>一等縣、一萬五千元到二萬五千元</p>
<p>二等縣、五千元到一萬五千元</p>
<p>三等縣、五千元以下</p>
<p>（七）編輯國民識字敎材辦法</p>
<p>第一、敎育部在最短期内編成三民主義千字課一部、使常人能在四個月裹、每天一小時修畢、</p>
<p>第二、前條所編課本、用混合編制法、附注音字母、藉以推行國語、敎材除注重三民主義外、兼及常識、</p>

<h3>昨晚</h3>
<p>德實業團抵滬</p>
<p>數日内即將入京</p>
<p>德公使今日亦到</p>
<p>國民政府邀請來華視察之德國實業團八人、首在廣州視察一星期、即乘美最時洋行之德郵船特爾弗林格號、於十日自香港來滬、已於昨晚十時抵埠、船泊虹口公和祥碼頭、全體團員上岸後、下榻南京路外灘華懋飯店、我國各機關昨晚赴舟次歡迎者、有工商部代表徐善祥、農礦部代表楊公召、外交部代表張韻海、浙江省政府代表朱重光、上海物别市政府代表沈怡、徐佩璜、同濟大學代表胡庶華、及譚伯羽等人、上海特别市政府、定今午設宴、爲全體團員洗塵、並介紹雙主見面、</p>
<p>至正式公宴、須俟該團赴京返滬後、定期舉行、</p>
<p>來華使命、本報記者、昨晚訪該團於華懋飯店、由該團團長勒慈曼氏延見、</p>
<p>當告記者、以來華之使命、渠在華有二十餘年之外、七年前回德、今次舊地重游、實深愉快、德意志實業視察團、純係德國重要實業界代表所組成、其來華之動機、</p>
<p>起於二年前國民政府鐵道部長孫科游德之時、當時孫部長曾與德實業團接洽、歡迎德實業界來華投資、發展中國各項實業、藉謀中德兩國經濟界之合作、孫部長回國後、即代表國民政府來電、正式邀請德實業界、組織代表團來華、觀察中國南</p>
<p>北經濟及實業狀３况、然後擬訂開發計劃、</p>
<p>彼此協商、方行投資、渠意發展實業之唯一前提爲和平、</p>
<p>視察計劃、勒慈曼氏續稱、渠等於上月底抵香港、即赴廣州視察一星期、並蒙粤省政府當局熱忱招待、十分感謝、渠等在滬、擬勾留數日、視察滬地實業經濟狀况、然後正式入京、但入京期現尙未定、大約不出本星期或下星期初、在京拜訪政府當局後、再行來滬、至此後視察計劃、須由政府决定、惟渠等預定之視察行程、擬先往無鍚、渠與無鍚實業巨子榮氏頗諗、然後溯江而上、至大冶漢口長沙等處、再返滬北上、且預備至太原視察、惟不幸南北現正對峙、政府是否允彼等至太原、則未能决定、此外則擬至天津北平及東三省各地考察、然後回滬返國、</p>
<p>團體組織、該團成立於今年二月間、於二月二十八日在烏賽港、乘日郵船箱根丸、首途來華、三月三十日抵港、轉往廣州、於七日在香港、乘特爾林格德郵船來滬、昨晚抵埠、團員共八人如下、（一）</p>

<p>浙江第一批</p>
<h3>移民將來滬</h3>
<p>二十日到上海</p>
<p>即行轉往東北</p>
<p>去年浙東荒災、被害者、有四十餘縣、浙江省政府、爲辦理移民殖邊、曾派杭縣縣長潘更生、赴遼吉黑各省、實地調查、現在第一批災民、已據報到者、將於本月下旬出關、昨日浙江省政府、爲移送事宜、</p>
<p>特致函上海各輪公司、略謂現據各縣報到之墾民、已有四百户、約一千四五百名、擬由温台寗紹各地、於本月十五日、</p>
<p>派運送員、分頭帶領、乘搭商輪、准於二十日至滬、再在上海候船、運送到港口登陸、事關移送災民殖邊、不獨救濟窮黎、</p>
<p>且與國計民生、關係亦至鉅大、各輪公司、當樂爲贊助、所有前項災民移墾、乘輪出發之免費辦法、或撥輪專送、以利進行之處、除派員接洽外、特再知照、又接</p>
<p>市政府函告、謂該項移民、將於四月底資送來滬、候船出發、赴東北、特派委員周柏桐、與本埠申台綫内之舟山·平安·台州·逹興·及温州綫内之益利等輪公司、</p>
<p>磋商免費乘船辦法、經聯安航會議定、凡由浙境之海門·石浦·定海·穿山·等處乘船者、由舟山·大華·穿山·逹興·台州·</p>
<p>等輪公司船承運、由温州坎門出發者、由益利輪承轉之、船資照半價收取、小孩在七歲以下者、免費、七歲以上者、照額收取、至於移民上船、按照移民册點齊人數後、即由知照縣政府、當時付給現金、由公安局、通飭永嘉·臨海·象山·定海·鎭海·各縣政府照辦、至於湖杭綫、係由内河輪運送、目下所應决定者、爲寗紹區、</p>
<p>而滬甬綫、則與三北、招商、寗紹等三公司接洽、定今日議定後、便即實行輸送來申矣、來滬之後、將由招商等派輸運往營口也、</p>
<p>社會局</p>
<h3>維持民食文告</h3>
<p>責米商抑價十八元</p>
<p>復令米店减低售價</p>
<p>戊辰社云、昨日滬南到米、仍未間斷、銷路以蘇同白粳較暢、價又回落一角、松江薄稻因去胃衰弱、亦跌角許、其餘靑角薄稻常帮白粳、開價均較前日見小、如天晴到貸一湧、則米市可以站定、不致再生變代、惟洋米仍見堅漲、因内地購買甚殷、</p>
<p>寗波温台等地採辦尤急、閘北米市、已見活潑、昨做開三千餘石、價已回落半角之譜、特頂靑浦薄稻售十九元、惟報紙所登價格、並未標明等級及來源、故與南市比較、竟有相差一元數角之多、社會局深恐有人朦混抬價、昨已分令豆米業公會·滬北經售米糧公會·及嘉縠堂米業公所等團體、勸告同業、當此米市平落之際、不得再行扳價、并須設法平落、至特頂粳以</p>
<p>十八元爲最高價、又以麵粉爲補助食糧要品、昨亦訓令麫粉廠同業公會、昭告同業、不得又乘機抬價龍斷居奇情事、該局更據閘北經售米糧公會呈報、望亭運滬米船在蘇州被扣、亦經呈請市長轉函蘇省政府交涉、茲探得此項全文、及交涉扣米情形、分誌如左、</p>

<h3>爲取締民信局之呼籲</h3>
<p>新嘉坡各團體爲中外取締民信局事、函電紛馳、竭力呼籲、茲爲彚誌如次、</p>
<p>快郵代電、中央黨部、國民政府、僑務委員會、上海華僑聯合會、全國商聯會、商驚　會、僑務愶進會、全國各商會、各報館、各社團公鑒、上海申報二月念八日刊　、交通部郵局總辦、對國民社記者、發表南洋民業信局總包寄遞問題一節、欺侮華僑、瞞騙國人、閲悉之下、不勝痛心、謹將取締民信增加郵費請願經過、及其發端倩形、條	列駁述如下、（一）郵局總辦、謂十八年八月、英屬吉隆郵政來電聲稱、馬來各島及南洋各島政府、决定取消民局制度、並定十九年一月一日實行、九月二日來函、續申前請、要求取締云云、等語、似此所陳、一若取締民局、出自英屬、</p>
<p>而究其事實眞相、則大　不然、查民十五十月北京交部、曾有一次取締信包之令、後經新嘉坡中華總商會代表全僑、籲請中外當道、業蒙准予無限展期保留在案、嗣民十七北代統一、我國民政府成立、十一月、汕郵局忽頒新章、不准民信來往總包付郵、民十八二月念六日、總商會乃再據案力爭、旋於四月念三日、奉交部批字第六五號之批、内開、略謂民信局、旣不應永久存在總包辦法、亦無無限展期之必要等語、推翻成案、</p>
<p>僑憤激、爰於七月十三日、在總商會内、召開全僑大會、一致主張、繼續請願、文電交馳、籲爭至再、風聲所播、遂令當地政府、格外注意、華民政務司疊向商會會董探查消息、向使交部若無批示、不許民局存在、而加以取締之語、則全僑自無大會之召集、且亦不至引起此間政府之生心、彼吉隆郵政八九月之函電、何自而來、盡可想見、事實具在、有案可稽、謂非發自吾國、其誰信之、（二）即證之民十八十月十三日、「新嘉坡華僑請願保留民信局全體大會」之呈文、内有一節、謂「新嘉坡馬六甲等處郵局、索許民局領照營業者、現亦因此、於最近期滿、有停止續給之説、</p>
<p>而據向詢問情由、則藉口於我國郵政、業有取締廢止民局爲詞、且謂我國政府、若仍照與保留、在彼原無問題、定當如舊發給」、云云、然交部對此、全無批覆、亦無解釋、個中情形、益便僑民愈滋惶惑、直至代表謁見坡督、始知郵局總辦、業先自發其端、來函與吉隆郵政總監商請取締、而僑民亦遂恍然於交部之無批覆、與解釋之原因矣、（三）今歲代表面謁坡督、請願减費、吉隆郵政總監、同時列席、交出我國郵局總辦來函、内有（一）請吉隆總監、於一九三○年停止續給新嘉坡等　處民局之牌照、（二）謂經派委、着令汕厦各民局、寄回海外民信、遵例粘貼郵票一角、（三）謂對聯郵辦法、决能實際履行照其函意、大言侃侃、</p>
<p>直可適合國郵公約、然不解者、旣請吉隆郵政總監、於一九三○年停給民局牌照、而對記者談話偏又文飾其詞、謂其宗旨、無非使僑胞之通訉不致因英屬郵政之取締民局而感不便、語意矛盾、欺人自欺、蓋牌照停給、則民局歇業、僑胞通訉、於何取便、况聯郵辦法、欲照履行、對於郵務根本計劃、亦應着手實施、今閩粤兩省交通是否便利、户口是否編訂、鄉村僻野尙無郵局、　苻遍地盜匪如毛、若遇途刦、生機垂危、郵政總辦、曾亦於此而加注意否耶、若徒以增費爲能事、謂一方可免受不遵聯郵公約之責難、一方可使郵費歲收之增加、而僑民之擔畢如何痛苦、概不之知、僑民之籲請如何懇摰、均置不答、此果交通當局所謂愛護僑民、便利民衆爲職志者、所應具之態度歟、綜上三點、其情形固已昭然若揭、</p>
<p>而郵政總辦、竟謂「與事實適相背馳」果何所據而云然、如謂業經去電、向英屬當局質問、則英屬當局、定有覆電、應請將來往函電原文、全部發表、以明眞相、否則病國害民、難辭其咎、僑民處此、以家屬生命所寄、實覺痛切剝　、今旣呼籲無門、爰再披瀝倩由、涕泣電請我中央黨部、</p>
<p>國民政府、秉承總理遺訓、切實保護華僑、解除痛苦、尤望我國内各界同胞、憐念僑艱力爲一致抗爭、不勝迫切待命之至、新嘉坡各團體請願澸輕民信郵費僑民大會叩删代表團主席林金殿、</p>

<p>等語、吾僑聞訉、　　奔走、以海内外民業信局、</p>
<p>本係通連一氣、爲僑胞月寄銀信·　養家屬者所需要之一重大機關、若汕厦民局、勒令歇業、則海外民局、亦必同時停止、雖有郵局可資通訉、</p>
<p>而其缺乏利便、實與僑民以難堪、故有請願保留之舉、及蒙行政院飭交通部暫行緩辦後、方深慶　、而去歲郵局突又派委着汕厦民局·寄回海外民信·每封貼郵票一角之命令、同時居留政府、</p>
<p>亦起取締、每封應貼郵票一角二分、照平日民信寄費、國外每封三分、國内每總包四十封二角八分、今兩方政府、均着遵照郵例施行辦法、擔果太重、殊苦吾民、然據推舉代表、向當地政府請予減輕之際、則謂取締增加、出自吾國政府所主張、執政諸公、是何居心、僑民愚騃、莫之敢知、</p>
<p>而因居留政府實行加費、定期四月一日、迫不得已、乃有駁船業工會出而呼籲、同時參加者六十三團體、於前月二十三日、假座中華總商會、開全僑大會、到者擁擠、一致主張、繼續請願、即席</p>
<p>成立「新嘉坡各團體請願減輕民信郵費僑民大會」、一方向居留政府懇與四個月之展期、以爲磋商接洽餘地、一方公推中央僑務委員會呂委員渭生·爲請願代表、連日各會館各社團及馬六甲中華總商會　坡僑民大會等呈電五十餘通、</p>
<p>均置不理、在華僑平日愛國輸財、未敢讓人、事實俱在、應爲舉國同胞所共信、私心自問、亦甚希冀統一之後、凡百更始、而僑民前所感受之痛苦、或可解除於一且、胡今之日、苦上加苦、痛中增痛、適得其反、殊出料外、如謂取締民局、欲以求合於國際郵約、然根本要圖、則又當便利交通·編訂户口·　清盜匪·斯取於民者、而亦有以便於民耳、今不此之務、而海外僑民之銀　、尤仍須賴民局以爲傳遞·津貼工費、在所不免、兩重負　、所難堪者、何莫非我無量數胼手胝足役如牛　博得血汗微貲以資家人生活之勞　界者歟、今者力竭聲嘶、不得不遙望我國内外各報館各社團各界同胞、共起力爭、務使交部收回成命、照舊辦理、除奉删日代電外、相應具函奉　、</p>

<p>並稱、取締民局之議主自英國政府等情、敝等以爲本地政府·及中國政府間之行文、必係一種誤會之結果也、（八）敝等若能求得中國政府、直接</p>
<p>表白現時民局之不可廢、則想本地政府亦必不强將郵費增加、敝等以爲民信局一日存在、於代任郵局投遞之義務時期内、增抽郵費、殊無充分之理由、蓋敝等曾述總包之辦法、係以數千封作一包、今郵局欲於總包中之每封强加郵費、是不　强華僑工界、納此分派數千封及討回數千封回信之費用、與僅投遞作一總包之費用相同、敝等以爲政府待遇工界、實至不公耳、（九）敝等知民信局所算之匯水·常比市價爲高、如郵局能照市價代匯三數元、則增加郵費、不成問題、因匯水低廉、足以補償所失、今郵局增抽郵費、並無擔任投派之義務、而使華僑工界、每月寄二元三元者、納本地郵局一角二分、納中國郵局覆信費外、又須受民信局匯水之吃虧、敝等敢謂此種費用之總計、非貧苦之工界所能負擔也、敝等謹求、貴督將總包加抽郵費之命令、展期四個月、無任待命之至、新嘉坡各團體請願減輕民信郵費僑民大會代表團上、十九·三·四、</p>

<h3>滬西江橋鎭罷市經過</h3>
<p>滬西江橋鎭全鎭商店、於前日發生罷市風潮、其原因聞係前日下午五時許、有駐該鎭之水巡隊兵士一人、便衣携悈、出外採案、適爲保衛團員暼見、報告團部、立即召集團員二十餘人、一致武裝、出外巡防、以免發生意外、當時六區公安局第一分所江橋鎭第三派出所巡長李德奎、率領巡　警數人、亦正巡查其地、與武裝保衛團相遇、詢問武裝巡防原因、言語之間、微生衝突、忽於旁側發生槍聲一響、但此槍聲、究爲何人所發、雙方均未查明、水巡隊便衣兵士、亦不知去向、在警所方面、以開槍者係保衛團、責其不應亂發槍彈、而儣雙方之衝突愈烈、結果、保衛團團員錢某、由警察帶入該鎭派出所、以便查究槍聲之由來、昨日上午、全鎭商店、以警所不查便衣兵士之來歷、反將團員拘獲、遂全鎭罷市、公安局六區署長段温恭·與六區一所長王希祥聞訉、</p>

<p>特區地方法院</p>
<h3>開審外僑訟案</h3>
<p>昨爲第一次開審</p>
<p>係英美商行控案</p>
<p>秩序較以前更佳</p>
<p>新法院精神煥發</p>
<p>上海特區地方法院成立、而數十年來之領事陪審關度、從此消滅、往後該院審理各國僑民控告華人之刑民訟案、可無陪審之事發現、日本方面、對於撤消陪審、</p>
<p>前雖尙持異議、然近日亦經就範、該院楊院長以所受理各國商人控告之案、舊管新收、爲數甚多、應即陸續開審、以免積壓、業由民庭各推事、訂定審期、飭　分别通知各當事人、依期報案、聽候審理、</p>
<p>昨晨、爲該院成立後第一次開審外僑訟案之日、由民庭庭長應時·推事周逹仁·</p>
<p>及簡易庭推事龐樹蓉·駱崇泰·各開第七·八·九·十·等四庭、審理英·美·兩國商行所控追償貸欵等案數宗、英·美·等國領事、咸遵守新訂協定、抛棄陪審、而各案原告之律師、則皆係外籍者、各帶譯員出庭譯述、與承審推事毫無隔膜、秩序較以往有領事陪審時爲佳、緣今由推事單獨審問、無人從旁干涉、遂亦不發生無謂之事端、且旣無爭執、則一案之結束、自不致於拖延時日、故取消領事陪審制度、</p>
<p>在主觀上固爲收回我國旁落之法權、而在客觀上、對於旅滬各國僑民、亦有便利也、</p>
<p>吳淞商會請改良</p>
<h3>淞滬路蒸汽車設施</h3>
<p>滬支路、自改用蒸汽車行駛以來、乘客咸稱便利往來班次、時間亦甚正確、茲悉吳淞商會主席委員鄭樹珊、對於該車之設施、尙有數點、認爲必須改良者、（一）</p>
<p>該車行駛時、有極多之火星、自烟囟内冒出、因風遠颺、着於路旁之房屋、容易肇禍、且沿路經過之處、房屋櫛毘、如日前張華浜鐵路旁之草房、亦被蒸汽車内之火星飛出、而遭焚毀、亟宜設法改良、以免再有發生危險情事、（二）江灣張華浜之間、添設高景廟一站、殷行一帶之旅客、</p>
<p>果然便利不少、然該處頗形荒僻、行人稀少、恐遭匪類覬觎、入晚尤多危險、應由路局方面、酌派武裝巡警駐站、常川保護、以維旅客安寗、遂於昨日、由吳淞商會將上項情形、函請路局劉司長、設法改良、以臻完善云、</p>
<p>張市長</p>

<h3>寗波駁船被英輪撞壞</h3>
<p>公會正在交涉中</p>
<p>據四明運駁煤船業公會消息、本埠寗波船户鍾小靑駁船由老大陳小五駕駛、裝載石頭、于四月二日上午七點零五分、由浦西到浦東、行近陸家嘴水巡捕房面前、適値英商保和洋行Ｓunland輪由拖駁領帶、亦在該處航行、此時拖駁忽然讓出、致該輪船頭不能自主、乃直向水巡捕房前進、該駁船因　促間讓無可讓、致櫓前（左面）被該巨輪撞壤、損失甚鉅、但當時另有Ｕarilc輪、</p>
<p>在櫓後察過、略有徵損、鍾小靑當向四明運駁煤石船業公會報告、要求設法救濟、保和洋行即請泡立生台維公正人估計、並會同該公會派員互商賠償辦法、但該行祇認櫓後係伊撞懹、以致一時不能解决、查nc!j!e商輪船小、確在櫓後察過、懹船尙在、極易明瞭、惟當時情形爲何、自有别船可以證明、聞此事尙在交涉中、</p>

<h3>哀國殤</h3>
<p>— 鄭質庵</p>
<p>弔東北邊防陣亡將士</p>
<p>黑龍江上烟塵起。羽書一夕行千里。舉棋無日定中原。借箸有人籌北鄙。北鄙孤懸肅戍軍。一時意氣激風雲。人間豈有從軍苦。</p>
<p>塞外長留禦寇勲。深溝高壘安排早。眼中那恨同仇少。勇號初標落雁都、捷音已遞連雲堡。别有偏師水上來。江聲更比角聲哀。還憑一炬瓠中火。不放熿江鐵銷開。强虜不將凡眼覻。</p>
<p>豕突狼奔來又去。捉影相驚白雁飛。裹瘡誰念黃龍戍。入寇重來曳落河。力窮援絕待如何。豈知夜半量沙後。猶唱當年勅勒歌。舍生取義男兒事。銜鬚肯負平生志。</p>
<p>凄凉身後淺黃衫。慷慨懹中枯墨字。太息軍中有一韓。（謂旅長韓光第）只留故壘與人看。不知先軫元何在。賸有王琳血未寒。遼陽三月雲猶凍。何人痛定還思痛。</p>
<p>冷月招來國士魂。悲風吹斷春閨夢。七尺奇軀爲國捐。不須啄肉恨烏鳶。且將一勺黃封酒。遙　千秋碧葬磚。</p>
<h3>全運大會的食品統計</h3>
<p>— 嚴洗塵</p>
<p>此次全國運動大會。不但轟動全國。</p>
<p>抑亦頗爲外人所屬目。故外僑之從遠道蒞會參觀者。頗不乏人。如日本大阪新聞社日日新聞社。均於開會前一日特派記者到杭。參與大會。從事採訪。各項成績。已詳見各報。即大會花絮。各報亦靡不盡量刊載。第於大會之食品消耗。似尙未提及。實亦頗饒興味也。茲將向該會廚房調查所得。錄誌如下。</p>
<p>當大會開幕後之第一二三日。計運動員及裁判員等每餐須開三百卓。其他職員約一百卓。今則若干代表團已有回里者。故卓數亦隨之稍減。茲將每日消耗較多之各項食品列下。</p>
<p>品名每日消耗數品名每日消耗數</p>
<p>米十四石左右肉三百斤</p>
<p>鷄蛋五千枚魚六百斤</p>

<h3>續誌體育家魏旭東</h3>
<p>— 胥梵</p>
<p>本談前載體育家魏旭東。事實甚確。</p>
<p>惟余昔年肄業吳門。親聆魏先生敎澤者。數易寒暑。故知其歷史較詳。爰續誌一二。以資紀念。</p>
<p>魏先生諱廷喗。旭東其字也。滿清兩江督制魏光壽。乃其族祖。會改編新軍。</p>
<p>設將備學堂於白下。先生得由行伍選入。</p>
<p>學成測騐。術科冠曹。學科殿軍。終以技術精優。仍列前茅。先生落落大方。不以學弱諱言也。嗣陸春江巡撫江蘇。委先生擔任高等學堂體育一席。先生即設備鐵槓木馬天橋平台等器械運動之具。除日</p>
<h3>媒竹</h3>
<p>— 嵇覲</p>
<p>媒竹俗名雙合竹。産於廣州東北蓼溪口。兩本一體。</p>
<p>枝葉交加。外表無甚歧異。鋸而視之。中有兩孔。如呂字狀。據土人云。昔童男女二人。（年代姓氏不右考）在溪邊嬉戲。各持靑竹一端。擲諸中流。聲言兩竹相合。當爲夫婦。視之果然。</p>
<p>歸以告其父母。卒締婚約。而好事者即將此竹移植其上。日見繁茂。因名其潭日賭婦潭。潭在蓼溪口。兩旁媒竹成林。頗饒風致。茲友人李君自粤中歸。出一枝贈余。長約五尺許。其葉盡脱。惟根際略具莖鬚。云右復活。容當植諸園中。覆以坏土。但未識其果有一線生機否也。</p>
<p>授兵式操外。循循敎導器械運動。輒於夕陽西下。在操塲演習。任人參觀。如舉鼎鐵槓旋風車等。能有數十旋迴之勁力。輕身活潑。儼若電輪撲撲。人皆見之驚奇。</p>
<p>而先生之盛譽四溢矣。</p>
<p>維時吳門學校寥寥。敎育當局。對於運動會游藝會等並不督促。而先生爲提倡尙武精神計。首由高校組織運動會。旋東吳大學第二師範等校友。響應參加。先生輒於集會時。宣傳體育之有益人身。吳下弱習。因先生而競尙振武矣。嗣蘇州商團成立。亦聘先生爲司令。時先生已兼執東吳敎鞭。終日指導體育。不遺餘力。光緒未季又膺上海商團敎練之聘。每週分道蘇滬。輪日授課。從此執蘇滬學商體育之牛耳。</p>
<p>先生好馳馬。乘自由車。乘馬疾馳之際。故意墜帽於地。能於回馬加鞭。電掣飛過原處。突飛身拾帽而去。乘車則於輪急時。獨足立車槓而行。或獻舉鼎之身</p>
<p>手。或一躍下地。任車前進。先生尾追車後。復飛躍而上端坐踏駛矣。其神速時四十五標敎練某。亦善技術名。以標部書記官劉介玉之介紹。（即天台山農）嘗於運動會之餘。與先生賽。結果錦標卒爲先生得。而先生謙謙可風。亦樂與人同樂也。</p>
<p>惜今已歸道山。不復再瞻先生之技術矣。</p>
<h3>金閶觀櫻記</h3>
<p>— 孝侯</p>
<p>記者以江蘇全省報聯會改組事。有蘇州之行。抵蘇後。承蘇州明報主編仇崑厂。並記者陳士佩等。偕赴天平虎邱遊覽。並至鄧尉看梅。遊罷歸來。適金陵舊友吳韾山來訪。記者與談去秋東遊。以時令關係。未得一覽三島櫻花爲憾。因言蘇之盤門外靑陽地。現値櫻花盛開。不得於扶桑三島者。不妨於國内得之。時記者正整裝待發。擬附下午五時特快車赴鎭江。距開車不及三小時。吳君力促其行。</p>
<p>爰共駕車前往。一鞭殘照。得得蹄聲。約念分鐘即抵目的地。近觀櫻花排列成行。</p>
<p>瓣似桃梅。而色作粉紅。燦爛如錦。曲折蜿蜒。約一里許。入口處。置有停止車馬路牌。遊者抵此。即須下車步行。惟日警制服戎裝。乘自行車。巡視於櫻花隊裹。</p>
<p>木屐之　女。倘佯其問。悠然自得。據同遊吳君見告。斯地素爲日租界。日領事館居此。附設日警署。爲吾華治權所不及。近聞以市面寥落。有仿鎭江英租界。由我國收回之説。猶憶去春偕金陵新村陳紹君同志。侍母偕遊西湖。於滬杭道中。相約今春以遠東運動會事。提前赴日。賞覽櫻花。並有聯吟名云。鐵道龍蛇走大陸。</p>
<p>新村愛侶共　遊。遠看綠樹靑山影。盡在春雲眼底收。今者紹君以受環境激刺。侍母家居。遯跡不問世事。記者又江湖浪跡。尙無棲止。回憶前影事。不勝今昔之焉。</p>

<h3>八佾雅集彩排誌盛</h3>
<p>— 若</p>
<p>八佾雅集成立於二月二十三日。距今僅一月有餘耳。蓋社中諸子。多半爲票界先進。故對於戲劇祇須經敎師略説。加以短時期之練習即能登　演唱。本月六日。該社特假寗波同鄉會綵唱一畫夜。藉留紀念。茲將日塲所見。濡筆誌之。一時許開鑼。陳伯庸連演二齣。一爲黄金台。飾田單。一爲連環套。去黃天霸。此公本錢足。肚子寛。演唱時應付裕如。黃金台之倒板。唱嘎調。尤别賣力。駡殿以時間關係未演。改演寳君　臣之捉放。唱做頗具自然之致。路遙知馬力。因余在後台爲某君吊嗓。未及一聆。旋黃鶴樓登場。陳君伯庸之劉備。魏君莘蓀之周瑜。各擅勝場。魏君唱南梆子一段。婉轉柔媚。悦耳動聽。次爲王貫三與魏福蓀二君之别窰。王君飾平貴。身材適中·起霸姿勢邊式動看。首塲念扶保唐王立大功之功字。博得滿堂彩聲。魏君之王寳川。扮相秀麗。做表恪守繩墨·首場引子完畢。唱一大叚正二黃。字準腔圓。尤見功夫。至表演夫妻離别之情。亦恰到好處。</p>
<p>余每觀此劇表演至此。往往使人汗毛直竪。兩君演來並無此等弊病。足見其研討之深矣。此劇操絃一役·魏君囑余擔任。余勉强承乏。差幸無過耳。繼此爲張怡生之閙府。張君爲北平老票友。唱宗叔岩。富有韻味。問樵一塲。身叚純熟。絕類内家。眞非易易也。大軸爲趙醉秋之玉堂春。趙君扮相嫵媚絕倫。西皮慢板原板。唱幾乎有腔皆程。無句不新。而李氏昆仲之琴。襯托尤妙。斯劇王公子一職。爲名票友聶君少萱所飾。尤爲生色不少也。</p>
<h3>龍華桃花一看法</h3>
<p>— 研千</p>
<p>龍華桃花。如萬片紅霞。長亘數里。誠海上一大觀也。然以前吾人但知約侶駕車。或相將步行以往。從未知於穿林繞樹而外。尙有其他賞覽之法也。</p>
<p>作者前日由得勝港搭平滬班新閔馨船往上海。道經龍華嘴。遙見紅霞片片。若在被風推行。又若千萬紅衣女郎。成團作舞。印象之佳。勝於穿林繞樹多多也。</p>
<p>歸後與朋儕談及。咸謂此事實與發現新大陸同樣可喜。於是又相與計擬新看花法。共得三則。</p>
<p>最先發言者沈君。謂宜駕摩托船。頻淺渚而航。緩緩往來。以資深賞。船中可預置酒脯佳茗。以佐勝游。</p>
<p>次爲時君發言。謂宜與曾學泅水而善打槳者划小艇而游。則非特陸上桃花可盡情觀賞。即水邊艶影。亦可恣意撥弄矣　　末由梁君言。以爲宜坐西式小帆船乘微風蕩漾其處。帆影映紅。迺大可賞玩者也。</p>
<p>作者謂三君之意。實三而一者也。可總稱日龍華桃華一看法。吾將筆錄之。實自由談。以公之衆。三君同聲日善。乃書之。</p>
<h3>滑稽常識</h3>
<p>— 葉立民</p>
<p>如果黑襪後跟破了一個洞。</p>
<p>穿上鞋子露出一段肉。豈非很不雅觀。可笔墨來把肉塗一塗。</p>
<p>那末再不會給人看出了。</p>
<p>破壤的雨傘。切勿抛棄。可把傘骨子拆去。當司的克用。</p>
<p>襪子穿破了。把不段剪去。可當袖籠或脚套。</p>
<p>鐘買不起。祇要買一隻雞。可以報時刻。而且還得嘗肉味。豈非一舉二得麽。</p>
<p>買鞋子最好同樣買二雙。倘使穿壞一隻。便配上一隻。再穿壞一隻。再配上一隻。這亦是一個絕好的經濟法。</p>
<h3>心上温馨　（一六七）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十回　赤燄騰天勾欄欽孝女、紅毹貼地即席晤名伶</p>
<p>他們看了左詩晨等的票子。是二十五、二十六、二十七三張聯號。恰好是第三排的左面。那個劇塲裹觀衆坐位。是兩邊分開。中間讓出一條走路的地方。舖着一條長地毯。那時來觀劇的人。已經不少了。士女如雲。還是學界中人占多數。因爲這種新劇。不是知識階級中人是不要　看的。看了也莫明其妙。見不到他的好處。今天來的觀衆中。大一半是靑柳社的社員家屬。非親即友。可是人也不少。在七點十五分鐘的時候。人都已坐滿了。台前懸了一個油綠絲絨的幕。幕的下面。還有一排流蘇。近流蘇處。却有很美觀的花邊。沿台的周圍。是一排電燈。電燈外面。都有一個罩。使燈光不刺激觀衆的眼睛。未開幕之先。全劇場的電燈都開着。要是在開幕的當兒。須把全劇場的電光熄了。只剩台上燈光。那　可以使佈景分外的顯明。又可以使全劇場觀衆的眼光。都注意在劇台上。所以他們對於燈光是非注意的。外國劇場中。有專門管理燈光的人咧。在將開幕之前。却有一個人。從幕中走出來。向觀衆門報告一番。你道此人是誰。便是陸君扶了。他説的是靑柳社怎樣組織的歷史。及一切請指導的客氣話。隨後有謀得利的音樂隊奏着音樂。便即開幕了。以後便一幕一幕的做去。在台上演劇的時候。説也奇怪。許多觀衆都一點没有聲息。只聽得台上清清楚楚的講話。直要到那一幕下了。。方　許多人聲嘈雜起來。紛紛議論。要是在舊戲院子裹。戲台上在那裹唱戲説白。台下人聲紛擾。也在談别種話兒。却没有那種精神貫注了。演了兩三幕以後。左詩晨便問蕊雲道。你明白那齣戲的劇情嗎。蕊雲點點頭。説這很容易懂得。因爲都是白話。雖然他們説的是官話。</p>
<p>但是那種官話。也容易聽得出。左詩晨笑道。你帶了幾塊手絹兒來。蕊雲莫明其妙道。只有一塊呀。可是你要擦手嗎。説時。把小得和手心大小的一方澹紅絲織手巾。授於左詩晨。左詩晨搖頭笑道。不是我要擦手。以後兩幕。是很苦的。你看了一定要出眼涙。所以我敎你預備了手絹兒。蕊雲道。你説我要擦眼涙用嗎。不會不會。我的心腸是最硬的。碰着什麽悲苦的事。也不會流涙。况這不過做戲呀。並不是眞的事。</p>

<h3>糧食　河下米市復小</h3>
<p>閘北河斛已開···銷呆下游</p>
<p>南市到接去滯···再轉軟勢</p>
<p>閘北、昨日天陰來源凋零、綠運商得滬上嚴限之訉、在途觀望待機、但當局因十八元之限價、在事實上殊難執行、故已順從各方之請、准覆二十元之限盤、故晨間河存貨客一致出樣求售、賣氣因而興旺、奈北粳銷化奇呆、買客進意清淡、行情乃陡跌兩角左右、中次批降尤足、市况已轉不振、薄稻走銷亦滯、交易仍不開展、幸底貨尙不湧厚、價格故祇小角外、羊秈及杜客秈脚地較穏、且存一到不旺、大盤是以挺定、通變陰元有少數吊胃問津、市無榮辱、全日河斛計二千餘石、</p>
<p>滬南、河到雖不暢旺、然積貨仍有、而南路米來源亦接、本街買户初尙活動、旋得北市下游之訉、市交頓懈、常蘇各機粳遂轉大盤約疲角半、而同里貨宿次須降兩角之多、查邇來米價已逹高峯、故市勢一經暢呆、貨品之别價往往有一角之上落也、南帮重固靑角練塘等薄稻早稻、市胃沉寂、銷塲極微、寗帮亦覺觀望、行情因隨粳市見軟、羊埠各秈到貨不多、店胃微動、盤面平平、白元杜客均有抵埠、去化不爽、價呈站立、</p>
<h3>洋米步漲兩角</h3>
<p>期洋米漲錢許</p>
<p>昨日洋米新到不多、而去路特佳、有内地寗波温台江北本街各大帮爭辦、市價隨見跳漲、現米因各客競辦、竟又跳起二角有零、路貨相似、期米洋行看好、且産地報漲、致少抛售、價亦上漲錢外、統市開出現米一號西貢三千包、價十五元半、十五元三角七分、二號西貢五百包、價十四元八角半、小絞二千包、價十四元八角半至十四元七角、大絞二千包、價十四元五六角、路貸有大小絞敏黨等萬五千包、期貨三千噸之砠、</p>

<p>昨日期麥、各月份市面、呈近俏遠平之象、本月份因傳廠方仍有收貨之意思、兼之現麥因廠胃甚佳、高麥喊起幾分、因此人心極俏、交易亦大暢、而此中之主因、以前月收價到二錢半、今則不前一錢零、未免太與事實相左、買氣之陡增、殆即此故也、遠期交易、亦見盛暢、惟天色已佳、人心未能扳緊、結果本月份較前日好三分、</p>
<p>六月份不動、七月份小一分、八月份大一分、九月份同、現麥市况、昨日高貨喊價較大三四分、</p>
<p>因無鍚廠家、　於本　之麥價、　於内地、有在申採買、再運内地之風傳、因此各檔喊價、遂見　　也、開宿州麥五兩一錢七分、江西麥五兩零二分、四兩　錢、漢口麥四兩八錢八分、四兩七錢、共開六行餘包、　　新　廠辦去云、</p>
<h3>標粉似轉軟勢</h3>
<p>實銷因時局及價昂不旺</p>
<p>洋麥　價雖漲大心仍軟</p>
<p>昨日粉市各月份市面大致均轉　軟、因目下</p>
<p>之實銷帶以時局及市價太昂、未能合划、多數均觀望不前、照標　而言大約非低去幾分、終難引動辦胃、而多頭方面、彷彿業外佔多數、　於實銷之不前、市面之不能復昂、不免不漸漸回出、所以洋麥報價難見回振、人心則依然疲滯也、</p>
<p>到遠期各月份、因天氣轉佳、温和舒適、人心亦見軟弱、觀本月份如實銷呆擯、小廠家之抛貨未補、此種價格當可定住、遠期則爲時尙遙、須以天時爲轉　也、結果本月份較前月小七厘产半、五月份小五厘、六七八月份小七厘半、九月份小五厘云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　海外華絲需殷價漲</h3>
<p>紐約廠經漲八九分···里昂漲一二法郎　　邇來海外市塲、前因日絲價昂、相率觀望、而日政府撥資保障、絲價擴張、共同保管、日絲輸出頓减、歐美消費不弱、存絲漸薄、對於華絲需要益殷、上週中美法市塲粤絲購進頗巨、茲因滙率轉堅、廠經購胃益暢、價均激漲、紐約中身滬白廠經週一開價每磅計漲美金八九分、里昂優等與上等現廠經每基羅亦各漲起一二法郎、滬埠期現廠經昨市成交亦旺、計乾利進滬白廠經九十包、魯黃廠經三十包、灰經二十包、價均明堅暗漲云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　細布猛漲之由來</h3>
<p>客銷暢旺···存底空虚</p>
<p>本廠棉布、昨日細布復漲、大有登峯造極之勢、蓋因實銷暢逹、但存底空虚、廠家開貸已售至七月份、五六月份之貨、亦已售　、而號家抛於客帮者爲數甚夥、迄今未曾交齊、津帮已照現市結價、致市愈抬愈高、染色布去路依然暢逹、故形勢之緊俏、爲年來所罕有、細斜以藍雙魚較軟、陽鶴亦頗俏利、粗布津帮成交二百餘件、惟粗斜去路仍呆、</p>
<p>東西疋頭、市情轉穏、東貨漲風已息、實以客銷不動、故無繼漲能力、昨細　嘰、直貢呢·等均無變動、白縐布雖有加價之説、但手貨人狗·</p>
<p>銅盃·兩牌仍售三兩、行家開三兩一錢、一度見缺之點秋香元洋紗下週一將有到貨、開八兩四錢半、唐太宗仍八兩二錢半、淺色印花色汀本街頗有添辦、唐太宗售一錢九分半、壽老騎鹿二錢、冲素綢徐州周村等帮略有添辦、昨可愛美人札藍三兩九錢、洋藍三兩八錢、文明色汀有大批到滬、價自一錢七分至一錢七分七厘半、西貨漂布長江帮頗爲活動、和記管鮑開十兩、泰和糽鷄十一兩二錢半、均有售去云、</p>
<h3>油市　兎起鶻落之柏油市</h3>
<p>柏油銷塲近十年來製燭與製皂各得其半當此暮春之初、製燭淘家正在預配夏淘用場、而製皂廠家亦因皂銷將旺、不能不追備原料、惟滬上自被著名之兩大皂廠、於前年皂價廉售後、各規模較小之皂廠均受影響、無不縮小範圍、故銷塲亦隨之更變、惟前以零星銷塲爲多、近已變爲整數矣、蓋小皂廠多、則零銷旺、大皂廠營業推廣、則整數多、各柏油行銷雖不減、然零化爲整、則獲利不若前厚矣、因大皂廠辦货認眞、價亦枯刻、</p>
<p>不若小皂廠之可將就也、如製燭一端、因夏令用場必取高料、非若製皂之祇取價廉、不講貨品高下也、近來兩種用品、正在需求之時、銷塲亦絡繩不絕、市面因漢口半月前來源不旺、廠城柏油漲至十四兩八錢後、因到貨　集、即跌至十三兩四錢、重荊亦曾漲過十五兩、然春令湧到之時偶而缺貨見漲、祇壘花一現、不能持久也、據近日漢函所詳、麻　油來貨較多、市亦平平、朱洪重荊在十四兩、三恒十三兩入錢、雜重及枝江十三兩六七錢、平荊十三兩四五錢、津市十三兩二三錢、長江上游春水未發、來貨一時不能過湧、故市面尙未過廉也、</p>
<h3>五金　軍用金屬品交易獨旺</h3>
<p>近數日來、軍用金屬品談判之多、成交之旺、</p>
<p>爲各貨冠、統計分運漢口天津兩處、共有七八千担之鉅、如花園鉛絲·小馬口鐵、·十號·十二號·</p>
<p>十四號·新鉛絲等、各有一二千担之多、此外白鉛皮·黑鐵皮·三角鐵·點鍚·紫銅等、聞亦不少、</p>
<p>至於大路貨若平白鐵·法西釘·英鋼板·近來交易甚少、市况亦頗寂寞、</p>

<p>社會消息</p>
<h3>愛爾蘭的遲婚與獨身者</h3>
<p>富蘭·</p>
<p>新近愛爾蘭自由邦刊布的一九二六年人口調查第五卷、内中有一部是專門討論該邦人民的結婚年齡和生殖狀况、</p>
<p>頗能引起讀者濃厚的興味、據稱自由邦的男女國民、他們結婚都特别地來得遲、</p>
<p>甚至於終身不婚嫁的、也所在多有、就大概説、他們在二十五歲至三十歲之間、不結婚的男子、要占百分之八十、三十五歲至四十歲之間、不結婚的占百分之五、五十五歲至六十五歲之間、不結婚的占百分之二六、</p>
<p>這般的數字、在世界上眞可推爲獨一無二丁、就歐洲各國而論、比數最和愛爾蘭接近的、要算瑞典、他們在上面所舉的三種年齡之中、不結婚男子所占的百分數、爲六四·二五·及一二、次之像芬蘭北愛爾蘭·和愛司唐尼亞幾處、大致與瑞典相差不遠、至於意大利、不結婚的男子所占的百分數、在這三個年齡之中、分别爲五三一七、及九之比、蘇格蘭和丹麥與之相同、英格蘭和威爾斯爲四五·一六·</p>
<p>及一○之比、葡萄牙和德意志大致與英格蘭相同、</p>
<p>關於女子方面愛爾蘭自由邦也在在顯示她們是最遲嫁或最少嫁的一種婦女、茲將她們的年齡和未嫁女子所占的百分數、列表如左、</p>
<p>年齡　百分數</p>
<p>二五至三○　六二</p>
<p>三○至三五　四二</p>
<p>三五至四○　三二</p>
<p>五五至六五　二四</p>
<p>同時北愛爾蘭女子、在二五至三○歲之中、未出嫁的占百分之五二、三五至四十歲之中、未出嫁的占百分之三一、五五至六十歲之中、未出嫁的占百分之二六、瑞典·芬蘭·瑞士都表現出同樣的數字、不過她們在五五歲至六五歲未出嫁女子的百分數、都在二十以内、至於英格蘭和威爾斯、則爲四一·二○及一五之比、他如丹麥·意大利·及德意志未嫁女子的百分比、不論在那一個年齡之中、都要比較低些、</p>
<p>據自由邦統計主任的表示、以爲在二六州居民之中、自從一八四一年以來、</p>
<p>反抗結婚的人數、一年多似一年、當那年的時候、所有二五歲至三五歲的男子、未婚的只占百分的四三、到了一九二六年、竟有百分的七二未婚了、又如在一八六一年、五五歲至六五歲中間未婚的男子、</p>
<p>只占百分之一一、到一九二六年竟升至百分的二六了、</p>
<p>女子方面的情形、正是一般無二、當一八四一年的時候、所有二五歲至三五歲的女子、未嫁的只占百分的二八、到了一九二六年、竟高至百分的五三、又如在一八六一年、五五歲至六五歲的婦女當中、未嫁的只占百分的一三、到了一九二六年、這般年齡的老處女、竟多至百分之二四了、</p>
<p>若説是志在移居國外、便是反抗結婚趨勢增加的原因、恐怕這個理由不見得圓滿吧、因爲若是志在移居、只有趁早結婚的、據數字分析的結果、自由邦農村裹的男子、結婚要比城市的遲許多、而自由邦城市裹的男子、結婚比别國城市裹的男子也要遲得多、但女子尙不十分如此、若説這是受了窮苦的壓迫、也不是適切的説明、因爲目下愛爾蘭平均每人的財富、着實勝過在一八八○年、或是一八六○年、及一八四○年的當兒、但那時候男女的結婚年齡、要比現在早得許多、這又何説呢、</p>
<p>但是雖則自由邦男女結婚來得遲、</p>
<p>和來得少、而該邦婦女的生殖本領、却着實不小、大概五歲以下的兒童、和四十五歲以下的結婚女子的比率、竟要占到百分的一百三十一、不能不説是全歐最高的比率了、因爲挪威占百分的一百十八、</p>
<p>芬蘭占百分的一百十四、瑞典爲一○三、</p>
<p>加拿大爲九六、丹麥爲九三、紐西蘭爲八二、德意志爲七五、英格蘭及威爾斯爲七一、上面的百分數、愛爾蘭自一八六一年以來、始終保持着這個紀錄、獨有英格蘭和威爾斯、則已從一一六减至七一了、</p>
<p>因爲女子有這般高的生殖率、雖則結婚遲晏、結果還能使愛爾蘭的兒童得到相當的分配、不愁稀少、所以在該邦每一百位十五歲至六十五歲的人民當中、</p>
<p>平均當有十五歲以下的兒童四七人、若與别國比較起來、像葡萄牙與挪威同爲五三人、意大利及丹麥同爲五十人、英格蘭和威爾斯爲三七人、瑞典·芬蘭·及瑞士·同爲四三人、法蘭西最少、只有三二人、而自由邦竟不肯示弱如此、</p>
<p>自由邦女子的生活、没有像英格蘭女子的舒適、而在大部分未嫁的女子、尤其是處境因苦、但是他們男子的生活、却勝過英格蘭、甚而可坐全世界第一把交椅、這因爲該邦的農業情形、適合於男子的緣故、</p>
<h3>中國應設計吸引外國游客</h3>
<p>中國評週報云、上海爲遠東游客往來之孔道、而未成爲一游覽之中心、殊爲憾事、據各船公司統計、每年世界各國之游客經過上海者、近四萬名、而上海實乏可使外客流連游賞之勝景、就國家觀點及經濟觀點而言、此皆可惜游客旣抵上海、因無可留戀、至多勾留一二日即去、致本埠商業失一大好機會、假定四萬名之游客每日用欵一百墨元、即上海公衆每年可享四萬元之利、若能誘致此四萬人勾留至十日、即可得四千萬元之利矣、</p>
<p>瑞士·法·德·意·西班牙·日本等國、</p>
<p>咸以誘致游客博商業上利益、日本今年在美國以十萬元之廣告費招考游客、馬尼拉亦用種種招徠方法、如嘉年華會等、</p>
<p>吸引游客、今後來游遠東之外人將踵趾相接、上海亟應急起直追、造成東方游覽之要地、第一須爲游客謀利便、上海本地雖乏佳景、而與蘇杭無錫鎭江南京松江距離不遠、火車皆可直逹、杭州除西湖外、其附近各地有極好名勝、汽車路正在建築中、今宜趕築杭滬汽車路、於杭州造頭等新式大旅館、可容數百人、附以划船騎馬乘釣等設備、又上海與蘇錫鎭寗各埠間亦開築汽車路、附以各種運動便利、</p>
<p>若能於無錫沿太湖邊關一公園、必爲外人所樂游、</p>
<p>此種大計畫、需欵殆數百萬、然將來可吸收外欵數萬萬、乃値得化費者、中外游客既盛、當地商業將大發皇、上海住民於星期餘暇、亦有可以游賞陶寫之地、他省開關汽車路、大有進步、而上海獨倜乎在後、殊爲可異、據道路改良會報告、中國所有汽車路之哩程、已由民國十年之四千哩、增至民國十九年之八萬六千哩、</p>
<p>在十四年至十九年之間、增至一倍、在十八年一年内、獨增二萬三千哩、而上海汽車路仍甚缺乏、此事急宜由中央與蘇浙兩省當局合組委員會、積極規畫進行、不宜再緩、此舉成後、各方咸受其利、較之爲歡迎一外國太子、急來抱佛脚、將貧民草屋大拆特拆者、於國家有光輝多矣、</p>
<p>惟有必須注意者、開築汽車路、必須爲眞正之良好道路、勿如南京中山大道之徒有其名、尤望築路費力加撙節、勿如中山大道之徒耗巨欵、據吾人所知、内地官員有强佔人民地屋、劃入汽車路綫、而不給相當之賠償者、此以國家建設之名義行之、殊爲不當、深望今後築路時、勿復有此、吾人寗願上海喪失每年四千萬元、而不願見中國貧苦民衆受此暴壓、要之、丹麥太子及美國富豪是否得見中國「地上之天堂」（指蘇杭）、於吾人民無甚關係、而民間之私産應永爲民間之私産、</p>
<p>則甚重要也、</p>
<h3>海王星外之四新星球</h3>
<p>未必有人類棲息</p>
<p>羅馬訊、意國有名天文學者兼氣象學者邊堂弟敎授發現在海王星以外之新行星四個、現復對客談其研究、謂彼不信此等新行星上住有人類、「此華星球距離太陽絕遠、其物質情形發展甚微、故謂有人類棲息、乃屬　言、此等星球尙在胚胎狀態中、比地球落後數百萬年、其發展尙須數百萬年之多、余用一切天文學者所用之數理的方法發見此等新星球、如是證明太陽系之範圍遙大於所能想像者、</p>

<h3>Disagreement on Party Leadership Issue</h3>
<p>Yan's Draft Telegram Welcoming Wang Has Been Revised</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, Zou Lu, Xie Chi, Tao Zhu, Lu Weigan, Fu Rulin, Xu Bangjie, and others met at No. 30 Fengsheng Hutong to discuss the issue of party leadership. The Western Hills faction still insisted that the Second National Congress in Shanghai was the legitimate authority. They met again at the same location this afternoon, and it seems they are getting slightly closer to an agreement. The date for Zou and Xie to go to Taiyuan is still undecided. The Shanxi side has repeatedly urged the representatives to come, but they are still waiting for equal treatment. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kong Fanwei visited Lu Weigan today, requesting Zou and Xie to assist and yield to Chen and Wang, stating that during this military period, they should not create more disputes, lest the other side be given an opportunity for analysis and division. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Northern Military Plan</h3>
<p>To Advance in Two Routes</p>
<p>Yan and Feng Coordinate Everything</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is said that the general offensive order of the Northern Allied Forces will be issued on the 15th. The military plan has been decided by Northwestern Army generals such as Lu Zhonglin, Shi Jingting, and Sun Liangcheng at an important military conference in Zhengzhou. Sun Liangcheng will serve as the general commander of the Longhai Railway, commanding the troops between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, cooperating with the troops of Sun Dianying and Wan Xuancai to attack Xuzhou from both sides. Song Zheyuan and Shi Jingting will serve as the front-line commander and deputy commander of the Pinghan Railway, attacking Wuhan. At the same time, Feng will go to Zhengzhou and Yan will go to Shijiazhuang to coordinate everything. (9th Electric News Agency)</p>
<h3>Yan's Headquarters to Move to Beiping</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a key figure from Shanxi, Yan's headquarters will move from Taiyuan to Beiping soon. The location will be the former Kuomintang headquarters. At the same time, four new departments will be established: Army, Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Interior, forming a de facto northern government. The staff will consist of influential figures from all factions, hoping to approach all parties. (9th Electric News Agency)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Discord Between Yan and Feng</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Official Tianjin news states that Yan is deeply afraid that Feng's acquisition of Zhengzhou will be detrimental to him. He secretly ordered the five divisions of Yang Xiaoou, Li Fuying, Yang Yaofang, and Guan Fuan to nominally be under Feng's command but actually occupy Zhengzhou, secretly watching Feng's actions. Feng also knew his intentions. After arriving in Shaanxi, he immediately sent Lu Zhonglin to lead Sun Liangcheng's troops, along with Wan Xuancai, Sun Dianying, and others, totaling about six divisions, to seize Zhengzhou as a base and try to resist. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Beiping Yuanjia Electric: (1) Wang Faqin, Chen Gongbo, and others have disagreements due to Yan's trust in the Western Hills Conference faction regarding the reorganization of party affairs. Furthermore, the joint declaration advocated by Chen and Wang has been delayed, and the reorganization of the Beiping government is hesitant and indecisive.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Difficulties of Gandhi's Non-Violent Approach</h3>
<p>Gandhi possesses a genuine religious spirit of self-sacrifice and saving others. His movement for national self-determination and independence, coupled with his unwavering attitude, is truly difficult for ordinary people to achieve. What is worrisome are unexpected obstacles. Considering the current situation, there are two concerns.</p>
<p>One is external interference, such as frequent labor strikes in railways and mines. When Gandhi decided on non-violent resistance, he first strictly prohibited any violent acts, saying that violence would most easily destroy the non-violent movement. However, if faced with the pressure of a strong external force, the masses' fighting spirit and indignation would be difficult to suppress temporarily. Therefore, avoiding violence is not easy. As Gandhi's advocacy began, clashes between volunteers and the police have already resulted in injuries and detentions. Gandhi's son has also been arrested. This situation is most likely to agitate public sentiment. Moreover, the railway worker strike has not ended, and the gold miners' strike has reportedly resulted in 50 deaths and injuries in clashes with the police. Although these strikes originate from different issues, once they expand, they are bound to have some involvement and provoke violence, making it impossible to maintain Gandhi's painstaking efforts. This is a major concern. The other is internal conflicts, such as clashes between Indian and Muslim religions. The incompatibility between the Indian and Muslim religions in India is similar to the internal strife between Jewish and Muslim factions in Palestine, which we discussed earlier. Although the origin of the incompatibility often stems from minor disputes over religious rituals, it actually contains political undertones. Muslims fear that they will be oppressed politically by the majority of Indian Hindus in the future because they are fewer in number. Hindus, on the other hand, worry about being driven by pan-Islamism. As a result, the two religions have been incompatible for more than a day. Recently, as they were resolving to further demand complete independence, incidents of destroying churches occurred repeatedly. Now, Shiite Muslims have also voiced opposition to Gandhi's advocacy, expressing sympathy for the counter-revolutionary party, while the counter-revolutionary party advocates suppressing the struggle between religious classes first. As a result, opinions are increasingly divided and the rift is increasingly apparent. During this intense period, such a situation suddenly arises internally, which is another cause for concern.</p>

<h3>First Committee of the Sea Conference</h3>
<p>Discussion of Submarine Issues</p>
<p>Various Tonnages</p>
<p>Decision to Limit to Two Thousand Tons</p>
<p>Humanitarian Issues</p>
<p>Advocating a Joint Declaration by All Governments</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th - The First Committee of the Sea Conference convened today. The chairman, British Naval Minister Alexander, inquired whether the attending committee members could handle the issue of abolishing submarines. After the members expressed their opinions, the chairman stated that the British and American proposal to abolish submarines could not be agreed upon, which was regrettable. The assembly decided to report to the General Assembly that abolishing submarines was impossible.</p>
<p>The discussion then turned to the various tonnages of submarines. The general proposal advocated a maximum limit of two thousand tons. However, the French representative stated that France already had a submarine of larger tonnage launched and planned to build two more advanced submarines with a tonnage not exceeding two thousand eight hundred tons. The committee then decided to petition the General Assembly to limit the tonnage of submarines to two thousand tons, but with a clause allowing any country to have three submarines not exceeding two thousand eight hundred tons, and the tonnage of these three submarines must be included in the total tonnage of submarines. The French representative also wanted to increase the caliber of the guns of advanced submarines from five inches to six inches, as suggested by experts. The committee also agreed that advanced submarines should have six-inch guns, but other submarines should only have five-inch guns. After a lengthy discussion, the committee</p>
<p>decided to refer the matter of aircraft carriers to experts for explanation and to propose solutions as soon as possible. The committee also discussed the important issue of humanizing submarines in the expert committee's report. The report stated that the term "merchant ship" should not include ships participating in warfare in a way that could revoke their special rights. Experts advocated that all governments should issue declarations</p>
<p>recognizing that submarines must abide by the same rules as non-submarines. Unless a merchant ship refuses to stop or refuses inspection, a warship must not sink or destroy it without regard for the safety of passengers, crew, and ship's documents. Furthermore, merchant ship lifeboats should not be considered safe havens unless there is other safety from wind, waves, or weather. The above points should be declared by all governments as regulations of international law.</p>
<p>The First Committee passed this report and the proposed declaration</p>
<p>and will submit it to the Plenary Session of the Sea Conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th - French Foreign Minister Briand has returned to London. The Sea Conference reconvened today.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Paris, 8th - Briand departed for London this afternoon, hoping to make a final effort to establish understanding among the countries at the Sea Conference. An interim speaker said that the situation at the Sea Conference was not as pessimistic as most people thought.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, London, 8th - The Three-Power Plenipotentiary Conference convened at noon on the 8th. After reporting on the progress of the expert committee, opinions were exchanged on the issue of exchanging and building light cruisers and destroyers. As a result, it was decided through mutual concessions between Japan, Britain, and the United States. As for the submarine issue, it will be discussed again at 2:30 pm on the 9th. In addition, the First Committee decided that the regulations regarding submarines should be adopted in the form of a joint declaration, not a treaty. Countries outside the five powers will also be allowed to participate, as the matter is important and requires the approval of all countries.</p>
<p>Japan United News, Tokyo, 9th - Negotiations between the UK, US and Japan regarding the review of the reservation clause, with the exception of a portion of the remaining destroyer tonnage and submarine accommodation issues, have largely seen a consensus of opinion. The Japanese side's original proposal for the reservation matters is generally as follows: 1. "This treaty shall expire on December 31, 1936. During the next transitional period, Japan may demand the amount of reservation in a free standing position." The above section must be inserted into the text of this treaty. 1. Until the end of 1936, the total tonnage of Japanese cruiser construction that can be started is 49,042 tons. 1. The amount of Japanese destroyer construction is based on 33,070 tons. 1. The construction of four replacement ships for the Furutaka-class of 7,100 tons will be changed to 10,000 tons class. 1. As for the submarine tonnage, approve more accommodation from the existing 78,400 tons.</p>

<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th - The Zhongfang authorities, who have been criticized for the salary reduction issue, have rumors circulating that the implementation of the salary reduction will be postponed or eased,</p>
<p>the cancellation theory and the 10% bonus reduction theory. Some say that if the bonus reduction had been implemented first, there would not have been this turmoil. The situation is still chaotic. Former Zhongfang President Muto Sanzan said about this matter: "Due to the flaws in the current cabinet's financial and economic policies, Zhongfang has also fallen into difficulties, leading to today's events. At this time, the Proletarian Party's labor movement is a good deed, and I hope it can be resolved satisfactorily. However, why not go further and attack the financial and economic policies of Finance Minister Inoue, which have put merchants, industrialists, and laborers in the current state, and the erroneous policies that increase unemployment, are the real reason. I hope that all sectors will focus on this point. If Zhongfang reduces bonuses, it is clearly affected by the ill-timed lifting of the ban, which can be asserted. For workers, although salaries are reduced, they are not eliminated, but are still determined to be maintained. As for whether or not to reduce bonuses, it has not yet been decided. The bonus reduction plan will be submitted at the general meeting in May."</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Osaka, 9th - Due to the announcement of the salary reduction plan,</p>
<p>Zhongfang, which caused a nationwide uproar, visited the Hyogo Prefectural authorities yesterday in view of the labor world's efforts, and explained Zhongfang's position, saying that it was necessary to reduce the salaries of employees due to the surrounding circumstances, but when the opportunity arises, they will definitely talk about preferential treatment methods, and strongly stated that even if the problem's salary reduction plan is implemented,</p>
<p>the income of employees will definitely not be inferior to other companies. The prefectural authorities replied that if there is a risk of labor unrest, it will be considered separately, but if their opposition movement is legal,</p>
<p>then it cannot be interfered with, but only maintained a bystander attitude.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th - The Zhongfang issue is becoming more serious. The general movement against salary reductions has a tendency to spread throughout the country. The Proletarian Party's joint movement, which has been difficult to implement in the past,</p>
<p>will be realized this time. The Proletarian factions are determined to form a common front to fight the company. The Labor-Peasant Party has already started the war. Representatives of the party and other labor groups of the Social Democratic Party visited company representatives today and formally demanded the withdrawal of the salary reduction plan. Labor-Peasant Party cadres decided to issue a joint statement to the whole country in order to promote the anti-salary reduction movement and general unemployment relief, with the aim of realizing joint protests and joint speech meetings. It is doubtful whether Zhongfang, which has always used a warm-hearted approach to prevent labor unions from invading, will be able to prevent this.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Osaka, 9th - The Japan Cloth Manufacturing Co., Ltd. on the outskirts of Fushimi Town, Kyoto Prefecture, announced yesterday, following Zhongfang, that it would reduce employees' monthly salaries by 10% and daily wages by 8%. However, the Japan Textile Union and other companies have no intention of reducing salaries. Japanese Textile authorities answered the Labor Union's questions yesterday,</p>
<p>saying that even if Zhongfang's salary reduction is successful, this question will not be considered.</p>

<h3>Tariff Bill in the US Congress</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 8th - The Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Representatives for discussing the Tariff Bill had previously decided to publish each tariff rate after it was approved, but today, it retrieved the old rules of the Parliament prohibiting the publication of the proceedings of the Joint Committee, while Congressman Ghana insisted on the method of publication, saying that even if the Committee does not allow publication, he himself will meet with newspaper reporters every day to tell them everything that is going on in the meeting. The members of the Committee, in order to urgently test the public's psychology on the new tariff rules, expressed sympathy for Ghana's proposal. Although fifty items of revised tariff rates have been made so far,</p>
<p>the important parts are still awaiting research. The members of the Senate and House of Representatives are all taking public opinion as a prerequisite and are unwilling to act rashly.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Restricts Tea Planting</h3>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 8th - A dispatch from the Netherlands says that if tea planters in the Dutch East Indies do not undertake to reduce production by one-eleventh, tea planters in Ceylon and British India may not be able to fulfill their promise to restrict tea production. Therefore, the Dutch East Indies Tea Association is now making every effort to move all its members to persuade them to increase the reduction amount from 7.5 million pounds to 10 million pounds and has called meetings separately. Bondouin is scheduled to meet on Thursday, and Batavia is scheduled to meet on Friday.</p>
<h3>Large Swarms of Locusts Will Invade Egypt</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Cairo, 8th - The Egyptian authorities, facing large swarms of locusts that have never been seen before, are re-imposing the compulsory labor system that has not been used for many years, conscripting laborers, and allocating 50,000 pounds specifically for locust control expenses. Countless swarms of locusts are now heading towards Suez from Palestine and Transjordan. Even trains are sometimes blocked by them and cannot pass. Although the Transjordan authorities have conscripted 7,500 Arabs to kill locusts, as many as 15,000 tons, the swarms of locusts have not decreased.</p>

<h3>German Parliament Tends to Dissolve</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 8th - The signs that the German Parliament will be dissolved early are becoming more and more obvious. The Parliament's Criminal Law Amendment Committee</p>
<p>has requested the establishment of emergency laws so that its work can continue as before during the period of dissolving the old parliament and establishing a new parliament. The Parliament's Finance Committee rejected the tobacco and soft drink tax, dealing a major blow to the government's entire financial plan. Although the agricultural plan has the support of the National People's Party, opinions of the parties,</p>
<p>are now consistent. It is still uncertain whether other proposals that the National People's Party has never supported will still be supported by the party. However, it is heard that the Social Democratic Party is prepared to support the government's financial plan,</p>
<p>so the situation of this case is still chaotic. Only the sugar tax</p>
<p>has been passed by the Finance Committee today, and there has also been some progress on the gasoline tax.</p>

<h3>British Wool Industry Brewing Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th - British Yorkshire wool industry employers posted a notice of a one-eleventh wage cut based on a report from an official inquiry team that the wool industry needed to reduce wages. The relevant trade unions agreed to reduce it by half, but the employers insisted on reducing it by one-eleventh. Therefore, the general strike in the wool industry at the end of this week may be unavoidable.</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>A telegram from Kaifeng to all newspapers: Henan Province is unfortunate. Disasters have occurred for years. Since the beginning of spring, the disaster areas have been without food, and people have been fleeing one after another. Counties such as Shanluo, Zheng, Bian, Qin, Zhuan, Meng, etc., have set up places to accommodate them, totaling 100,000 people. In recent days, there has been an urgent appeal for donations. There is no food to feed them, and no money to bury them. The critical situation is precarious. In other areas plagued by soldiers and bandits, transportation is blocked, and there is no way to escape. Corpses fill the ditches, and humans and animals compete for food, which is unbearable to witness. At this time of spring plowing, there are no seeds, farm tools, or anything. If sowing is delayed, there will be another autumn famine. Disasters follow disasters,</p>
<p>and there will be no end. Now, with a large army pressing the border and bandits everywhere, the great Central Plains will become a battlefield again. On top of the devastation, there will be another disaster of war. The suffering people will not have a single survivor. Gentlemen, resolving national affairs and mobilizing the masses is not your wish, and all of you aim to relieve the suffering of the people as your duty. The support of the people is crucial to success or failure. I urge you to consider the disaster victims and have great compassion, so as to preserve a bit of vitality in the local area and leave a glimmer of hope for the starving people. The mourning of the people in the two rivers is endless and filled with gratitude and anticipation. Zhang Fang of the Henan Provincial Relief Council bows respectfully.</p>

<p>The Central Political Conference held its two hundred and twenty-second political meeting at 8:00 am this morning (9th). Attendees included Wang Chonghui,</p>
<p>Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Sun Ke, Chen Guofu, and Hu Hanmin.</p>
<p>Attendees included Li Wenfan, Chen Lifu, Kong Xiangxi, Wang Zhengting,</p>

<p>Soviet Party Rectification Conference</p>
<h3>Please Protest Japanese Warships Sailing to China</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Party Rectification Committee recently submitted a request to the Central Party Headquarters to seriously protest the sailing of Japanese warships to China. The submitted document is recorded as follows: "According to reports,</p>
<p>fifteen destroyers of the Japanese First Hydroelectric Squadron suddenly departed from the Sasebo Naval Port in that country to China, ostensibly to practice navigation routes. They went straight into various key ports of the Yangtze River in our country. When the news came, everyone was shocked and horrified. It is found that independent countries in the world not only do not allow others to invade their domestic navigation rights, but also do not allow others to intervene in their territorial waters. Since the Opium War, our country has been</p>
<p>bound by unequal treaties, and foreign merchant ships have been able to freely enter and exit inland rivers, encroaching on sovereignty and manipulating commerce. The economic losses suffered by our people are incalculable.</p>
<p>Now, Japanese imperialists are intensifying their efforts and directly regard our country as a non-independent country. They dare to order their large fleet, fully loaded with soldiers, to sail into the hinterland of our country. Only the Japanese naval attaché orally notified our naval department and the Beijing Municipal Government.</p>
<p>This is an unprecedented example in the international community, insulting our country and encroaching on our sovereignty. It is truly intolerable. Party departments and people at all levels in this province are all heartbroken and indignant, and are calling for action. They should ask the headquarters to protest sternly in order to calm public anger. As for the excuse of practicing navigation routes, the Yangtze River is our country's inland river. It is not comparable to the Rhine River in Germany today, which is managed by the powers. If the Japanese fleet wants to practice navigation, the vast Pacific Ocean is vast and unobstructed, and they can practice freely. Why must they take our country's Yangtze River as their destination for practice? It can be imagined that they are spying on our national defense and intending to create an excuse to start</p>
<p>a war. Recalling that when our party sent troops to the Northern Expedition, Japan took the violent action of sending troops to Shandong. Last year, Feng Yuxiang rebelled,</p>
<p>and there was an internal invasion by Red Russia. From the past, every time there was a disturbance in the country, there were imperialists who were secretly planning it. This time, the rebels Yan Xishan and others were in arms to create turmoil, and the Japanese destroyer fleet happened to come to China in a big way at this time. A glimpse of their intentions is infuriating. The members of the association feel the blood of the May 3rd tragedy has not yet dried, and they have witnessed the rampantness of Japanese warships. They are worried and disturbed, and it is difficult to remain silent. I respectfully express my stupid sincerity and humbly pray for your consideration. I am eagerly looking forward to it."</p>
<h3>Status of Nanchang-Xunyang Railway After Being Handled by the Ministry</h3>
<p>Operating Income Increases Year by Year</p>
<p>The Bureau Plans to Expand</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication, 8th - The Nanchang-Xunyang Railway is the throat of Jiangxi transportation. The entire line is more than 300 li long, with 10 locomotives and more than 100 passenger and freight cars. The Japanese debt it owes amounts to more than 10 million Japanese yen, and the situation is precarious and bankruptcy is imminent. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways took over the railway in January of the 18th year and appointed Long Xuesui as the director of the railway bureau to engage in rectification. When the railway was taken over by the Ministry, the monthly income was only more than 95,000 yuan, reaching more than 130,000 yuan in April, and averaging more than 120,000 yuan per month thereafter. Therefore, the income for the 18th year was quite considerable, with 749,500 yuan in passenger business, 696,700 yuan in freight business, and more than 12,500 yuan in other businesses, totaling more than 1,458,700 yuan. After deducting expenses, there was a surplus of more than 240,000 yuan, which was unprecedented (previously, expenses exceeded income). Yesterday,</p>
<p>I met with a certain staff member of the accounting department of the railway, who said that the operating income of the railway increased by more than 130,000 yuan in the 16th year compared with the 15th year,</p>
<p>increased by more than 230,000 yuan in the 17th year compared with the 16th year, and increased by more than 290,000 yuan in the 18th year compared with the 17th year.</p>
<p>If there were no rice exports this year, it could have increased by more than 300,000 yuan. It is heard that Director Long, in addition to personally crossing the East China Sea a few days ago to earnestly discuss with the creditor, the Japanese East Asia Industrial Co., Ltd., to reduce interest and schedule annual amortization, has also formulated the 19th-year expansion plan: (1) In terms of general affairs, strengthen the road protection team,</p>
<p>to prevent bandits and ensure the safety of traffic. (2) In terms of engineering, A. decide to revise the uneven parts of the road and those with too small a curvature to facilitate traffic and avoid danger; B. install water pipes and build water towers at the three stations of Nanchang Tujiapu and Dean; C.</p>
<p>rebuild the buildings of each station; D. clean up the land; E.</p>
<p>plant seedlings by the roadside to cultivate sleeper materials. (3) In terms of car operations, A. set up a pontoon boat on each bank of the Nanchang Zhangjiangmen ferry to facilitate communication; B. recruit merchants to open restaurants at the Niuxing Station to facilitate travelers. (4) In terms of machinery, A.</p>
<p>increase 2 locomotives, 8 passenger cars, and 40 freight cars;</p>
<p>B. build a new machine factory and purchase a 200-kilowatt generator to tow all the machines in the factory so that all types of locomotives can be repaired on schedule.</p>
<p>Nanyang Minxin Bureau Cancelled</p>
<h3>Re-establishment of Postal Agency</h3>
<p>Singapore and Xiamen postal agencies still oppose Xiamen communications. Many overseas Chinese from Southern Fujian and Chaozhou-Meixian who reside in Nanyang establish postal agencies to send letters and remittances for overseas Chinese. Initially, they sent it themselves, but after the ban by the British, Dutch, French, American governments in Nanyang and our country's post office,</p>
<p>they changed to general mail packing, that is, a number of letters are sent as a general package,</p>
<p>After arrival, the postal agency distributes them by themselves. However, this still does not comply with the Universal Postal Convention. After mutual consultation between our country and the Nanyang government, each postal agency is allowed to be changed to a special postal agency. However, each letter sent must have sufficient postage affixed. Last November, Lin Zhuowu, special commissioner of postal affairs of the Ministry of Communications, came to Xiamen to consult with various postal agencies in Xiamen. As a result, they agreed to postpone the implementation for four months. The British Nanyang Chinese Postal Agency also asked the local government to allow a four-month postponement. April 1 of this year is the date when our country and British Nanyang will implement it simultaneously. The Xiamen Post Office issued the regulations for special postal agencies on the 1st. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The Post Office establishes special postal agencies to unify the postal service and facilitate overseas Chinese communication. They are reorganized from private postal agencies that have been licensed for overseas business.</p>
<p>Article 2: When a private postal agency that has been licensed for overseas business is reorganized into a special postal agency, it shall first submit the original license for verification, fill out a petition in the format prepared by the Post Office, and request the competent Post Office to forward it to the Directorate General of Posts for approval and registration, and exchange it for a special postal agency license as a business certificate. If the aforementioned license is damaged or lost, the reason may be stated and a request for re-issuance may be made. However, the license shall not be transferred to others.</p>
<p>Article 3: Any private postal agency requesting reorganization into a special postal agency,</p>
<p>If there are branch offices that have been registered, they shall be clearly stated in the petition. After being approved and registered by the Directorate General of Posts, they may be reorganized into special postal agency branch offices, and the name and location of the branch office shall be recorded in the special postal agency license for reference.</p>
<p>Article 4: Each special postal agency and its branch offices shall be subject to the jurisdiction and supervision of the local post office and shall comply with all post office regulations.</p>
<p>Article 5: Special postal agencies are only allowed to receive and send return letters of foreign remittances, ordinary letters, and postcards. Each item shall be charged according to the national international postage rates.</p>
<p>Article 6: Special postal agencies shall comply with the postal regulations, affix international postage to each letter (i.e., return letter) sent abroad, and hand it over to the post office for delivery. Each envelope shall contain only one letter and shall not contain letters with different names from those written on the envelope. However, for the sake of convenience, they are allowed to be bundled and submitted to the post office for dispatch.</p>
<p>Article 7: When a special postal agency receives letters from abroad that have sufficient international postage affixed according to international rates, when forwarding them to the interior,</p>
<p>domestic postage is waived. Letters sent from the interior to foreign countries that need to be transferred through the exchange office are also allowed to affix sufficient international postage in the interior first, and there is no need to pay domestic postage again.</p>
<p>Article 8: The validity period of the license of a special postal agency is one year and shall be renewed every year. Each time, a handling fee of one yuan in national currency shall be paid per license. Each special postal agency shall submit a petition to the competent post office before December 1 of each year to forward it to the Directorate General of Posts for a new license. When issuing a new license, the Directorate General of Posts shall issue a license renewal permit to notify each special agency.</p>
<p>The old license shall be submitted to the competent post office for cancellation and a new license shall be obtained. Those who request re-issuance of a license in accordance with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 3 shall also pay a handling fee of one yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Article 9: When a private postal agency requesting reorganization into a special postal agency is approved by the Directorate General of Posts and a license is issued, the competent post office shall also issue a signboard with the words "Special Postal Agency", charging two yuan in national currency for each. The same applies to special postal agency branch offices.</p>
<p>Article 10: Any private postal agency that has been licensed for overseas business, if it wishes to be reorganized into a special postal agency, shall submit the original license of the private postal agency to the post office within one month after the implementation of these regulations to request approval for registration and exchange for a special postal agency license. If the deadline is exceeded, it will not be issued and the original license of the private postal agency will be canceled.</p>
<p>Article 11: These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications also sent Lin Zhuowu to Xiamen and Zhou Yundong to Shantou,</p>
<p>to explain to the private postal agencies. However, on the 2nd of this month, the local Postal Industry Association suddenly received a telegram from the Nanyang British Singapore Overseas Chinese Assembly,</p>
<p>saying, "Here, the reduction is six cents per letter, and the general package remains the same. It is implemented today. We have telegraphed the Ministry to request approval to keep it as it is, at most doubling it from before," and so on. On the 3rd, more than 70 representatives of the postal industry consulted with Lin Zhuowu to postpone the exchange of licenses and submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to reduce postage and retain the private postal agency and general package system.

<p>Important News 2</p>
<h3>Reply from the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department</h3>
<p>Reorganization of Suzhou Municipal Organs</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, regarding the reorganization of the Suzhou municipal organs,</p>
<p>Previously, it was resolved by the 275th Committee Meeting and handed over to the Department of Civil Affairs for review. Now, Director Hu has prepared a document to reply. The original text is recorded as follows: "According to the instructions in Order No. 1369 of your government, according to the resolution of the 275th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee, the Suzhou Municipal Government will be abolished in principle, administrative expenses will be reduced, and business expenses will be expanded. As for the takeover of organs and the continuation of business, it will be handed over to the Department of Civil Affairs for review, etc. Upon receiving this, I hereby record the case and order the department to comply and handle it, etc. I secretly investigated the takeover file,</p>
<p>Since Suzhou presented the establishment of the city, its municipal government's administrative expenses in the 17th year of the Republic accounted for almost one-third of the city's business expenses, which is very different from the principle that the city's administrative expenses account for one-fifth of the business expenses. Although repeated orders have been issued to tighten up, there has been no sincere compliance. Therefore, the progress of emerging construction is slow, and the infusion of existing business expenses is difficult. Daily discussions of digging and scraping are causing citizens to blame each other. All of this is due to the fact that the original organizational scope is not compatible with the economic reality of the city. Changing the course is already urgent. Recently, the Legislative Yuan, in view of the fact that the spirit of the past municipal system did not conform to local realities, has set another principle draft and is engaged in revision. The conditions for setting up a Class B city in Article 4 (</p>
<p>1) The population is over 300,000; (2) There are special circumstances in politics, economics, or national defense; (3) Business tax. The annual income of license fees and land tax accounts for one-half of the city's total fiscal revenue. Now, according to Suzhou's population, it is only 260,000 or so. The provincial capital of the Republic of China was moved,</p>
<p>There are few special circumstances in politics, economics, and national defense.</p>
<p>Business and land taxes have not yet been opened, and license fees are not under the jurisdiction of the city. Therefore, Suzhou City has lost the conditions for a Class B city under the new principles. The decision of the Committee Meeting of Your Government to abolish the municipal government of the city in principle is indeed very appropriate, but</p>
<p>The municipal government of Suzhou should be abolished, but the municipal administration of Suzhou should not be interrupted for a day. According to the draft municipal organization principles, in addition to Class A and Class B cities, there are provisions for Class C cities. Class C cities establish municipal offices, under which there are bureaus or sections. The mayor is recommended or appointed, and a municipal council is set up in the municipal office. This principle,</p>
<p>It is most suitable for the orders of your government. The Department of Civil Affairs intends to directly change the establishment of Suzhou Municipal Office in Suzhou, take over the original municipal government organs, simplify the organization as much as possible, reduce administrative expenses as much as possible,</p>
<p>Expand business expenses and continue to handle it. In terms of the status of Suzhou City, the mayor's treatment is proposed to be recommended and still belongs to the provincial government, with the Department of Civil Affairs as the competent authority. As for the internal organization of the municipal office, after this case is approved, the Department of Civil Affairs will formulate and submit it for approval in another case."</p>
<h3>Recent Financial Situation of Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces</h3>
<p>Guangdong's military expenditure requires 4.5 million per month. Guangxi Province has no tax revenue and paper money is scarce.</p>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence. Guangdong Province has recently used troops in Guangxi Province. It is reported that the military expenditure in March has increased to 4.5 million yuan. As of the 31st, 3.8 million yuan of military expenditure last month has been spent. On the 3rd of this month, the Department of Finance allocated another 350,000 yuan in cash.</p>
<p>Escorted to Wuzhou and handed over to the Eighth Route Army for distribution. It is found that 350,000 yuan of military expenditure in March is still owed. As for the expenses of various agencies in February, they were delayed until the beginning of this month and have not yet been cleared. It is estimated that the administrative expenses in February will be cleared in mid-month. The treasury bonds for military needs issued by the Department of Finance some time ago have recently sold 2.54 million yuan, and there are still 1.46 million yuan left, which are currently being promoted. It is expected that they will be sold out in a month. In addition, the Tariff Committee recently decided to hold eight special taxes to increase revenue. It is found that in July last year, the committee decided to completely cut off the Likin tax in the province in February this year. At the same time, special consumption taxes such as timber, livestock, paper, minerals, soybeans, cotton, fur, and tin foil were held. On the 1st of this month, the committee held the 39th meeting and immediately decided to hold it. The next meeting will discuss the investigation methods. After the investigation is clear, the tax rate will be discussed and the collection regulations will be drafted. In the future, when the tax is levied,</p>
<p>the government's estimated income will be enough to offset the Likin tax that has been cut off. As for the financial situation of Guangxi Province, since the outbreak of the civil war in the province,</p>
<p>the financial situation has fallen into a stalemate. In the past, Wuzhou was the concentration of wealth in Guangxi, and the interior areas were all barren areas. For the past two years, the war has been endless, and local finances are equal to the farmers looking up at the roof.</p>
<p>Business is declining, and the source of income is naturally cut off. The so-called relatively wealthy Wuzhou is still within the scope of military affairs. The loss of Guangxi banknotes suffered by the people of Wuzhou is particularly painful.</p>
<p>The Guangxi banknotes were issued by the Guangxi government in the past few years, almost tens of millions. After Huang Shaoxiong and others failed, the government collapsed, and the Guangxi banknotes were not guaranteed. At first, it fell to 30%, and now it has become waste</p>
<p>paper. Currently, the Wuzhou General Chamber of Commerce has sealed up more than 3.2 million Guangxi banknotes. The Wuzhou merchants and the people of Guangxi have suffered huge losses, and the business of Wuzhou City has plummeted, and countless people have gone bankrupt. Recently, Liang Elian, the Director of the Wuzhou Finance Office appointed by the Central Government, has formulated a method to maintain the waste currency and is implementing it with discretion. However, it is found that in Nanning and Liuzhou, Li Huang</p>
<p>and others are still wantonly issuing this paper money, which is difficult to guarantee not to be mixed into Wuzhou. If so, the maintenance here and the wanton issuance there will inevitably have zero effect. Therefore, recently, in order to prevent the paper money wantonly issued by the other party from being mixed into Wuzhou City, the Finance Office has specially notified the people of Wuzhou City to take the paper money they had previously stored to the Chamber of Commerce for registration and transfer for safekeeping in order to start trying to maintain it.

<h3>Harbin Strictly Prevents Communist Propaganda</h3>
<p>Inspect Mail and Telegraph, Investigate Household Registration</p>
<p>And Set Fundamental Prevention Plan</p>
<p>Harbin correspondence. In the past month, the Third International has been trying its best to promote propaganda in Harbin. Chinese youth who are willing to be raised by others and driven to do the most effective redification work, such as the Anti-Imperialist League, the People's Mutual Aid Association, etc., have been established one after another, and leaflets containing incitement to strikes and school strikes have been distributed. The authorities are afraid of affecting the overall situation and have repeatedly tolerated it, resulting in the Communist Party's activities being openly unscrupulous. Recently, the Northeast Political Committee received a report, sincerely fearing that Harbin City would suffer from communism</p>
<p>bloodshed, especially yesterday ordered the Special Zone Chief Executive Office,</p>
<p>to forward the order to all subordinates to prevent it together, and to implement inspection of mail and telegraph, and investigation of household registration. The order is recorded as follows: "According to reports, the Communist Party in Harbin is distributing leaflets, openly opposing the party and the country, and supporting the Soviet Union. Mad teachers and journalists are in contact with party members, specializing in inciting students and mobilizing workers. First, they want to use railway workers, and then they want to lure local workers. Although the police have repeatedly cracked down, the crackdown is a crackdown, and the progress is its own progress. The distributed leaflets are signed by the Harbin Youth Anti-Imperialist League, claiming to be the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and are sent by the post office in vernacular newspapers. After translating the meaning of each single report, it is purely the tone of the Soviet Union, propagating redification,</p>
<p>If we allow it to continue and do not take precautions, Harbin will soon become the Third International. For the sake of the security of the Northeast, for the sake of the East</p>
<p>For the sake of consolidating the road, there must be a fundamental plan for the administration of Harbin. First, party affairs must be handled slowly, and party newspapers must also be set up slowly,</p>
<p>to avoid excessive promotion and flowing into communist propaganda. Second, schools must be strictly rectified. On the one hand, bad teachers should be eliminated, and on the other hand, bad students should be screened. Do not tolerate perfunctorily and nurture disaster-causing elements. Third, railway workers must be managed by us with extremely strict and appropriate methods, so that workers' rights</p>
<p>can be guaranteed, and prevent and stop at any time, to avoid being infected by foreigners.</p>
<p>In addition, for the inspection of mail and the investigation of household registration, the police should seriously carry out the work, or they may be able to eliminate the disaster invisibly, etc. In view of this, in addition to separate orders, the said office is ordered to formulate practical methods within its respective duties, strictly prevent it, and supervise and order its subordinates to prevent it separately, so as not to spread it, and to report the implementation situation for reply, etc. In view of this, the party factions in Harbin are complex,</p>
<p>Workers and students are mixed, and personnel have been sent to investigate at any time. Then, according to the secret report from the said place, we have already taken separate actions to prevent it. Now, in view of the foregoing, as for the sections on slowing down the handling of party newspapers, inspecting mail and telegraph, and investigating household registration opened in the original order, which belong to the duties of the said office, they should immediately comply with the order and seriously handle them, and supervise and order their subordinates,</p>
<p>Investigate and prevent at any time to maintain security, and report the handling situation for verification. "It is found that the Harbin Republic of China Daily Party Newspaper,</p>
<p>was originally scheduled to be published on April 1, but the authorities have the aforementioned order,</p>
<p>So the publication was suspended. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Establishment of Diplomatic Commissioner's Office in Harbin</h3>
<p>Zhong Yu Takes Office in Harbin</p>
<p>Harbin correspondence. Zhong Yu, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Harbin, arrived in Harbin from Jilin on the afternoon of March 30. In the evening, he visited Mo Dehui, the director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and talked about the formalities for notifying the Russian side of the Sino-Russian meeting. At 10:00 am today, he formed the Commissioner's Office in the old Negotiation Office. At noon, he went to Daowai to take up the concurrent position of Director of the Binjiang Municipal Preparatory Office. Recently, I visited Mr. Zhong and asked when he would notify the Russian side of the date of Mo's plenipotentiary's departure and the date of convening the meeting. Zhong said that this matter was only decided when he met with Director Mo the night before. I will handle the notification. However, I have not yet sorted out the Sino-Russian negotiation files clearly. How to word the notification letter,</p>
<p>There are places that need to be considered, so when it will be delivered to the Russian Consulate is still undecided. Before the notification is issued, it is tentatively planned not to visit the Russian Consulate.</p>
<p>The reporter asked again whether he would go to Russia with Mo's plenipotentiary in the future. Zhong replied that the entourage of Mo's plenipotentiary, except for those designated by the central government, are all personnel from the Chinese Eastern Railway and have been confirmed. I have no need to go with them. When asked about the organization of the office, Zhong replied that in accordance with the orders issued by the central government, in addition to the special commissioner, there will be one director,</p>
<p>several secretaries and staff members. The departmental system is not adopted, and the detailed rules for handling affairs will be drafted by me and submitted to the central government for approval. A office is also set up in Jilin, and a director and several staff members are responsible.</p>
<p>Important matters should be reported at any time. Changchun and Yanji are still handled concurrently by the respective municipal preparatory offices, but they are of a entrusted nature and consult by letter at any time when things happen. In short, all foreign affairs in the province will be concentrated in Harbin from now on. The Commissioner's Office in Liaoning will take a departmental system due to different circumstances. As for Mo Dehui's luggage, it is being actively prepared. Li Chen, an external entourage member, arrived in Harbin on the evening of March 31. All entourage members are also rushing to prepare their luggage. Mo himself plans to go to France and Germany after the Moscow meeting and inspect the road administration along the way. (April 1st)</p>

<p>Zhejiang Province has been handling immigration and reclamation for a long time. The provincial government now has more than 1,300 disaster victims from Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Hangzhou and other places reporting. Yesterday, it telegraphed the Northeast authorities to first transfer 400 households, which will depart from Shanghai by boat on the 20th of this month and land at Yingkou. Because the people of Zhejiang are accustomed to planting rice, the telegram also asked them to be settled in rice-growing areas.</p>
<p>In the case of Haiyan Xucun Market's abolition of frying and changing to sun-drying, the Liangzhe Salt Transport Department has repeatedly received requests from various stove merchants and all frying workers in the market to gradually reduce the number of years in order to seek to change careers gradually, and the magistrate of the market has submitted a request to exempt the phased reduction and extend the period to the end of the 19th year, when all stoves will be stopped at the same time. The Salt Affairs Department has now approved the extension of the period to the end of December this year and implemented sun-drying. The order has been forwarded yesterday for compliance.</p>
<p>The price of rice in Hangzhou City has risen sharply, with top-quality rice at 16.2 yuan per stone and starting rice at 13.6 yuan. In the past two weeks, the source is still lacking, and the market has increased again. Rice merchants are deeply feeling the difficulty. This afternoon (9th), the Municipal and County Rice Price Council held the 55th regular meeting at the Municipal Government. It has been decided to increase the price of rice of the upper and middle grades by 40 cents, and the starting rice will remain at the original price. It was also discussed that before the opening of the plain rice in the city, the starting rice is related to the livelihood of the poor and will not be increased for the time being.</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Jiang Erchang's Trial Record. Jiang Erchang, the former executive member of this county, was arrested and imprisoned privately for Zhang Youshu's book. After the victim's nephew, Fang Qin, told the county government, he secretly ordered Yin Risheng, the captain of the second team of the police, to lead the team to the countryside and bring Jiang Erchang and the victim, Zhang Youshu, etc., together with the seized guns, ammunition, and discarded national flags, to the county government for interrogation. Last night (8th), late at night, Du Cheng, the interrogator, opened the court for interrogation and ordered that no one be allowed to listen. Now, I know that Jiang Erchang's statement roughly said that Zhang Youshu's nephew, Fang Qin, abducted and seduced his sister to escape with her belongings.

He ordered Youshu to hand over the person, but Youshu refused to admit it and was willing to come to my house as a hostage to clarify the truth. As for the guns, ammunition, and bayonets used by the guard regiment, they all have passports and are not privately hidden. The old five-color national flag was made when he was studying in the past. After being discarded, it was used for wrapping</p>
<p>and stored in a box. The examiner then ordered that the case be investigated and temporarily detained for verification,</p>

The county government has now submitted this to the province for approval, and a notice was specially issued yesterday, limiting the original managers to hand over the property deeds, income and expenses, and remaining funds to the district office for management within two weeks. Those who conceal or resist will be arrested and forced to hand over the items by the Public Security Bureau. It is said that the most such property is located along the eastern Tang area.</p>

<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Investigation of Road Dispute: There is an original road in Beishi of Anting Town, which is the only way for farmers in the northeast to go to the market. However, the land on both sides is owned by the Xiaoxing Church of the 教會. In the middle of last month, the church was constructing something and planned to build a bamboo fence, making it difficult for pedestrians to pass. The citizens tried to stop it without success, so they filed a public complaint with the county government requesting an order for its removal. After receiving the complaint, County Magistrate Chen sent Pan Zhixing, the section chief of the Second Section, to investigate the site yesterday (7th). It was confirmed that it has been a thoroughfare for many years. A map has been drawn and submitted with an accurate report.</p>
<p>Response to the Reorganization of the Provincial Education Fund Management Office: The County Education Bureau and the Education Association, in response to reports that the cities of Beijing and Shanghai are competing to collect slaughter tax funds, the three ministers of finance, education, and foreign affairs plan to reply to the National Government to reorganize the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office, adding the heads of the finance and education bureaus of Beijing and Shanghai as members, not canceling the independent funding of Jiangsu education, and transferring schools such as Shanghai Middle School to the management of the cities of Beijing and Shanghai. The expenses will still be paid by the management office, but the schools will be owned by the cities and the expenses will be the responsibility of Jiangsu, which will lead to inconsistent authority and many disputes. A telegram was sent to Chairman Chiang, President Tan, the Ministry of Education, the Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, and the Department of Education, requesting them to make every effort to reverse the decision and dismiss the previous proposal, and also requesting the educational circles of Jiangsu Province to strive together.</p>

A report has been made to the county for investigation.</p>
<p>Rampant Banditry in Fengjing District: Fengjing borders Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and is a breeding ground for lake bandits. The banditry is now rampant and has reached its peak. Kidnappings occur every day. Last night, bandits came to Shijing Alley in Dongxiang, continuously looting four families, including Gu Guifang, Lu Heming, Zhu Weiqing, and Yang Sihai, resulting in huge losses. Before leaving, they kidnapped Lu Zihong, a new Gu nephew, Xiao Di, the daughter Xingbao, Yang's wife Zhu, and the young son Diguan, demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan per person. Zhang Ajin of Shangjia滨 was also kidnapped, and it was rumored that 5,000 yuan was needed for redemption. Efforts are being made to rescue them. Bandits also came to Nanzhuang Township to specialize in looting rough rice, and they often set fires. Thirty bandit ships have arrived in Caoli, east of the county seat, and the police have rushed to pursue them.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Execution of Mutinous Soldiers Who Shot the Battalion Commander: Battalion Commander Huang of the Second Battalion of the Third Regiment of the Security Team stationed in Jiaxing was shot and killed by eleven guard soldiers, including Hu Jiliang, on the night of February 1 when he returned with salary money and stayed overnight at the garrison outside Shanqing Gate, north of the city. They also robbed over 1,000 yuan in salary money and fled with their weapons. The local officials in He reported this and requested a warrant for their arrest. The mutinous soldiers Hu Jiliang, Dai Feiyun, Xu Yongxiang, and Gong Dekang have been captured by the Security Team and escorted to the Security Office for interrogation. They confessed that they were the masterminds behind the shooting of Battalion Commander Huang. Therefore, in accordance with the military law of the army, navy, and air force, the four mutinous soldiers were sentenced to death. On the morning of the 9th, they were escorted from Hangzhou to He and tied up at Xujia坟 outside the North Gate for execution by shooting.</p>
<p>Buddhist Layman Zhu Shaozhang Passes Away: Zhu Shaozhang of Wangdian devoted himself to Buddhism, and his precepts were strict. He often traveled to famous mountains in various places, seeking out Buddhist sites. In recent years, his spiritual power was profound, and he could cure diseases with sincerity. Last year, he came to Shanghai, and the number of people seeking treatment was overwhelming. Zhu only treated those he considered to have karma, and the effects were often miraculous. Now he has returned to his hometown to rest and chants Amitabha Buddha every day, without ceasing for forty days. At 7:00 a.m. on the fourth day of this month, he passed away without illness. By 7:00 p.m., his body was cold everywhere, but the top of his head and hairline still had warm air rising. Those who heard this found it strange.</p>
<p>Scheduled Lottery for Pest Elimination Bonds: The Jiaxing County Pest Elimination Bonds were scheduled to hold a lottery for principal repayment on March 15. However, because the Pest Control Association has been reorganized by the county government, the lottery date has not yet been held.

<h3>Shanghai Men's Basketball Team</h3>
<p>Five People Expelled Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai basketball team almost failed yesterday in the fight for the finals against the Hong Kong team. Fortunately, they made a final effort and won the victory. Several players who have been fighting for days,</p>
<p>Should have been substituted for each other to rest. However, in yesterday's crucial moments, players such as Tan Da　, Wei Haiqing, Kong Guangyi, Chen Wenkui, and Xia Zeren were not all on the court. Those who were on the court were unusually panicked, and their performance declined. The head coach Jiang Xiangqing, general manager Chen Yuze, and coach Xu Zhendong jointly sent letters to Tan and the other five, expelling them from the team and giving them transportation expenses to return to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Wins National Football Championship</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Decisive 10-1 Victory Over Nanjing</p>
<p>Nanjing Scores First, Team Fails to Connect</p>
<p>Since both teams entered the National Football Championship, in the preliminary rounds, the second rounds, and the semi-finals, they have been invincible, achieving victory after victory. Yesterday, starting at 2:00 PM, the two teams met in the football field, each deploying their most elite lineups. The Shanghai players, possessing both intelligence and courage, relied on their forward line’s swift passing and their impregnable defense. Their running was fast, and their kicking even faster, resulting in their victory and the championship. The Nanjing players were consistent and indomitable throughout. Although they lost the battle, it was due to their inferior strength, not a failure to fight. It is hoped that the Nanjing team will strive for future success. Victory and defeat are common in military affairs.</p>
<p>The Soccer Skills of the Two Teams</p>
<p>The Shanghai team’s forwards were all physically strong and exceptionally courageous. The team’s strength lies in its ability to work together as a whole, exerting full effort, without selfishness, and with good communication between players. Their passing, heading, dribbling, intercepting, and shooting all have unique qualities. The Nanjing team’s biggest flaw was its lack of cohesion, its inability to put up effective resistance. Individual players focused solely on dribbling, neglecting teamwork and passing. The entire team frequently relied on long passes, rarely engaging in close combat. This was likely due to the excessive pressure from the Shanghai team. However, they charged forward without fear, which was the team’s greatest strength. With long-term training, they could become a formidable force.</p>
<p>Individual Techniques</p>
<p>Sun Enjing, Shanghai’s center-back, guarded and intercepted the enemy, causing them to retreat in awe. He was as steady as a rock, ensuring no mistakes, truly the pillar of the team. Dai Linjing, the center-forward, was brave, agile, and skilled in turning, using his head and feet, passing, and receiving.</p>
<p>The two inside forwards, Chen Xiantian and Chen Jiaqiu, had extraordinary footwork with miraculous variations. They were also able to assess the situation, understand the environment, and exploit the enemy’s weaknesses. Their feints and pushes contained artistic flair.</p>
<p>The wingers were quick and agile, running swiftly, but unfortunately lacked the ability to adapt. The defenders, Li Ning and Chen Pu, were like iron gates at the back. As the saying goes, “It is easier to move a mountain than to move Yue Fei’s army.” Others, like Zhuang Shihong, also performed their duties commendably, without flaws.</p>
<p>In short, Shanghai’s brilliance lies in the similarity of each player. The above comments are based solely on yesterday’s performance. As for the Nanjing team, goalkeeper Tan Zhongzhang repeatedly saved difficult shots, making a significant contribution. His defensive methods were good, using a five-man defensive formation that prevented Shanghai from scoring for the first thirty minutes of the game, which was no easy feat. Others, like Gu Yuanliang and Zhong Guanming, had grasped the basics of dribbling but lacked the ability to adapt.</p>
<p>Commemorative Photo</p>
<p>Five minutes before the game started, the two teams entered the field in an orderly fashion. Photographers and newspaper reporters at the center of the field asked the Shanghai team to pose for a commemorative photo.</p>
<p>Gathering of Heroes After the game began, the Shanghai team immediately launched an offensive. The forwards rushed forward enthusiastically. Dai Linjing, Chen Yutian, and Chen Jiaqiu were like unleashed horses, running and colliding, fighting desperately. Unfortunately, the Nanjing team’s defense was strong, and they were unable to score.</p>
<p>A Bolt from the Blue</p>
<p>Before the Shanghai team could score, the ball was intercepted by the Nanjing team. With a long pass, left-winger Liu Zukan dribbled straight up to an ideal position and shot fiercely at the goal. The ball hit the left post and bounced in. Zhou Xianyan had no way to stop it and could only watch it enter the net. The Nanjing team took the lead.</p>
<p>The Young are Formidable</p>
<p>After conceding a goal, the Shanghai team pressed forward relentlessly. The Nanjing team’s goal was under constant threat. Dai Linjing and Xi Qiaosheng both took fierce shots. Fortunately, goalkeeper Tan Zhongzhang handled the situation appropriately, his hard work was commendable, and he can be considered a rising star.</p>
<p>Returning the Favor</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, Xi Qiaosheng had a shooting opportunity in the goal area, but his movement was too slow and was blocked by the Nanjing defense. However, the ball was recovered by Zhuang Shihong, who passed it to Chen Jiaqiu, who passed it to Dai. Dai shot fiercely at the goal and scored.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick</p>
<p>At this time, a Nanjing defender suddenly committed a foul in the goal area. The referee awarded a penalty. Dai Linjing kicked the ball in. The Nanjing team fell behind by one goal.</p>
<p>Adding Two More</p>
<p>After scoring two goals, the Shanghai team’s momentum increased. They surrounded the Nanjing team’s goal like an iron barrel. Eventually, Dai Linjing and Xi Qiaosheng scored two more goals in succession.</p>
<p>More Penalty Kicks</p>
<p>Near the end of the first half, Dai Linjing dribbled forward when a Nanjing defender came out to block him. Dai seized the opportunity to lob the ball, which touched the defender’s hand. Another penalty was awarded. Chen Jiaqiu took the kick but missed. Soon after, a Nanjing defender touched the ball again with his hand. Another penalty was awarded, and this time it went in. The first half ended with a score of 5-1, with Shanghai leading.</p>
<p>Charleston Dance</p>
<p>The second half began, and for the first five minutes, nothing was achieved. Suddenly, Dai Linjing got the ball and passed it to Tong Rongwen. Tong dribbled in a winding path, rushed past the defenders, and kicked the ball in. As he charged forward, his body swayed from side to side, resembling a Charleston dance. The posture was quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Diving to Catch the Ball</p>
<p>In the chaos, Wen Chenmao lost his footing. The Nanjing team’s forwards swarmed forward, leaving the Shanghai goal unguarded. At this critical moment, Zhou Xianyan acted with intelligence and dived to catch the ball, saving the game from the brink of defeat. The audience cheered wildly.</p>
<p>Four Goals in a Row</p>
<p>After Fu Heyi scored the seventh goal, the Shanghai team played casually, but their momentum did not diminish. Chen Pu got the ball in the middle of the field and passed it far to the right. Xi Qiaosheng reached it, kicked it in. Soon after, Xi Qiaosheng got the ball, dribbled past the defenders, and passed it to the center. Dai Linjing, waiting by the goal, headed the ball in effortlessly. Finally, Chen Pu got the ball thirty yards from the goal and kicked it in from afar. The ball hit the crossbar and bounced back. Chen Jiaqiu and Fu Heyi followed up closely and kicked it in. Then, the referee blew the whistle to end the game. Shanghai won the championship with a score of 10-1.</p>
<p>Final Expectations</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Games will soon be held in Japan. The team will likely be based on the Shanghai team. It is hoped that the Shanghai team will practice hard in the coming month, travel to the East and win the championship, bringing honor to the country and preserving the reputation of our country’s football for many years. The reporter has high hopes.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Wins Championship</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a 4-2 Victory Over Tianjin Decides the Hong Kong-Tianjin Baseball Final. The final match between the dragon and tiger teams of Hong Kong and Tianjin took place at 2:00 PM yesterday, with both sides displaying impressive plays. Hong Kong scored first, but Tianjin took the lead with a score of 2-1. In the eighth inning, Hong Kong made a major comeback, winning with a score of 4-2 and securing the baseball championship. Congratulations to the athletes of Hong Kong! Your efforts have not been in vain. The umpires were Zhang Guoxun, Wu Bangwei, and Ma Xun. The scorer was Li Saijun.</p>
<p>Double Play Saves the Day</p>
<p>Hong Kong was the first to bat. The Tianjin pitcher showed off his curved and powerful pitches. Three Hong Kong players were quickly forced out. Tianjin then took their turn. First, Bao Wenpei struck out after three pitches. Second, Zhang Jinglian advanced to first base, followed by Lin Rongbin.</p>
<p>His hit was short and was fielded by the pitcher, who threw to second base. Zhang reached the base first, and then it was thrown to first base. Lin Rongbin was also out. Fortunately, Hong Kong executed a double play, averting a crisis.</p>
<p>A Single Earns a Run</p>
<p>Hong Kong’s Chen Lunying took advantage of an error by the opposing first baseman, occupying first base. Soon after, he stole second base. Chen Yutian aided him by hitting a ground ball to the right, allowing Chen Lunying to run past third base and return to home base. Hong Kong scored first, and Chen Yutian occupied third base. Unfortunately, Chen Yutian was tagged out while attempting to steal home, reducing Hong Kong’s chances of advancing.</p>
<p>A Stalemate Forms</p>
<p>At the start of the third inning, both sides were calm and focused, with tight formations. Occasionally, a player would reach first or second base, but ultimately, they were forced out before they could achieve their goals. There were no changes in the score this inning.</p>
<p>Tianjin Gains the Advantage</p>
<p>In the fourth inning, Tianjin’s Hu Zhensheng hit a single and reached first base. The Hong Kong pitcher lost control, throwing four balls three times. Tianjin was able to load the bases. Hu scored thanks to Luo Qinglong’s single, and Gu Degang’s score was due to the opposing pitcher’s four balls. Tianjin took the lead with a score of 2-1.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Faces Another Threat</p>
<p>The Tianjin pitcher performed exceptionally well. The Hong Kong batters could barely advance. At the same time, the Hong Kong pitcher did not perform his duties well. In this fifth inning,</p>
<p>he threw four balls three times again, sending the runners to first base. All bases were loaded. The situation was serious, and the atmosphere was tense. Fortunately, Hong Kong was able to handle the crisis and turn the danger into safety.</p>
<p>Key to Victory</p>
<p>The sixth inning passed uneventfully, without much change. In the seventh inning, Hong Kong’s Chen Lunying and Chen Qiongren each hit a single. The batters filled up the first three bases. Hong Kong had a great opportunity for a comeback, but unfortunately, it was all for naught. A good opportunity</p>
<p>vanished like smoke.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Suddenly Makes a Comeback</p>
<p>In the seventh inning, Hong Kong’s pitcher Zheng Qiongren and second baseman Chen Lunying switched positions, which was quite effective. Neither team scored in this inning. In the eighth inning, Hong Kong suddenly made a comeback. Liang Zhuoquan hit a single. Immediately, there were runners on each base. Three runners scored, reversing the situation. In the ninth inning, Tianjin tried hard to counterattack, but without success. Hong Kong won the championship with a score of 4-2.</p>

<h3>Shanghai and Tianjin Qualify for Finals</h3>
<p>Tianjin Defeats Beiping…46 to 33</p>
<p>The Tianjin Team Wins Consecutive Victories, Unstoppable</p>
<p>Yesterday at 1:00 PM, the Tianjin and Beiping men's basketball teams played their semi-final match. Since the start of the tournament, the Tianjin team had won many games and were sailing smoothly. In terms of strength, they are indeed impressive. The Beiping team had also been the leader of North China. The meeting of these two formidable opponents promised a fierce contest. The spectators crowded around the court, and the Tianjin and Beiping cheerleaders came out to support their teams, their cheers echoing throughout the arena. The details of the two teams' competition are described below.</p>
<p>First to Score</p>
<p>At the sound of the whistle, the two teams began to engage, both using their five-man defensive skills. After about a minute of stalemate, Tianjin's right forward, Tang Baokun, scored a long-range shot, opening the scoring amidst applause. Shortly after, center Liu Jianchang scored again, making it 4-0 to Tianjin. Seeing the strength of their opponents,</p>
<p>the Beiping team quickly called a timeout to regroup. However, after the game resumed, Tianjin still dominated. Their five-man team worked together like a vigorous dragon, showing their true abilities. Although the Beiping team was not weak, their teamwork was not as effective, and their shots were inaccurate, showing signs of panic. The score went from 4-0 to 10-3. Beiping tried hard to counterattack, but to no avail. The score at halftime was 23-14 to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Second Effort</p>
<p>After the break, the game resumed, with Tianjin's Li Qingan replacing right forward Tang Baokun. At this time, the Beiping players fought desperately, with center Wang Yuqing and inside defender Zhao Jiuxuan scoring two consecutive goals, creating great momentum. Tianjin called a timeout.</p>

<p>and replaced Yao Enhan with Wei Pengyun, and Li Qingan with Tang Baokun. With the lineup reorganized, they began to play with clever tactics, which proved very effective. Beiping suffered another setback. Later, Tianjin team mainstay Tang Baokun left the court after committing four fouls, and Yao Enhan replaced him. By this time, the score was 44-33, and the victory was certain. Tianjin changed from attack to defense, deliberately stalling for time. Beiping was helpless. Finally, Tianjin scored another goal.</p>
<p>The score in the second half was 23-19, and the total score was 46-33. Tianjin defeated Beiping, winning the right to play in today's final. They now have a 60 percent chance of winning the men's basketball championship.</p>

<p>Shanghai Defeats Hong Kong…47 to 43</p>
<p>The Strength of Both Sides is Exceptionally Even</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, the Shanghai team and Hong Kong team played after the Tianjin and Beiping match. Hong Kong defeated Kobe the day before, and their energy and agility had been admired by the general public. Their performance yesterday was even better. The score at halftime was 26-19 to Hong Kong. At the start of the second half, the Shanghai team finally regained their usual strength and launched a strong counterattack.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team, with its frequent substitutions, lost its focus. It was not adept at scoring. Several scoring opportunities were missed. At the same time, Shanghai's Lu Zhongen and He Tong, seeing the urgency of the situation, also exerted their strength. The score went from 19-26</p>
<p>to 21-26, 23-26, and 25-26. The Hong Kong team went seven minutes without scoring, and their formation became disorganized. The difference between the two teams was only one point, and the game became more intense. In the eighth minute, Huang Yunli scored a goal, making it 27-26, putting Shanghai one point ahead of Hong Kong. However, the Hong Kong team was not discouraged and counterattacked more forcefully. In the last five minutes, the scores fluctuated between the two teams. The audience was very excited. With only two minutes left, the score was 47-41 to Shanghai. At this point, Shanghai switched to a defensive strategy, and the Hong Kong team attacked with all their might, creating four or five scoring opportunities under the basket. However, they were unlucky. The ball either went outside the basket or bounced off the rim, failing to score. Otherwise, Shanghai would have been defeated. In the last few seconds, Hong Kong finally scored a goal, making the final score 47-45 to Shanghai. The game ended at the same time.</p>
<p>The score in the second half was 28-17, and the Shanghai team won. They will play the Tianjin team today to compete for the championship. Judging from the Shanghai team's performance yesterday, their teamwork and shooting accuracy seemed slightly weaker than the Tianjin team. Without special effort, there is little hope.</p>

<p>The situation of becoming equal with the ratio of five. Later, the opponent's offensive was extremely fierce and gradually became unsustainable. After Hong Kong changed sides with eleven to six, they served once.</p>
<p>Won ten points in a row, so they won. In the second game, the competition between the two sides was even more intense. They stalemate each other for a long time. In the end, Chen Xibing's spiking skills in Hong Kong were great.</p>
<p>There was no mistake. The spiking points were almost all taken care of by him alone. He made repeated contributions and the score must have increased sharply. As a result, the Hong Kong team won again with twenty-one to eight. Referee Li Feiyun, the lineup is listed on the left,</p>

<p>Although Jian had qualified for the semi-finals, compared with Guangdong, the gap was huge. Yesterday's game was dull and unremarkable.

<h3>Grand Competition Scene</h3>
<p>Team Scores</p>
<p>Hong Kong 17 points</p>
<p>Liaoning 13 points</p>
<p>Guangdong 2 points</p>
<p>The previous day's rain caused the swimming semi-finals to be postponed to yesterday. Although it rained in the morning, it cleared up after lunch, so the event proceeded smoothly according to schedule.</p>
<p>The spectators were still extremely crowded. Liaoning, with high hopes, had male and female cheerleading squads come to cheer and encourage, in high spirits. The four sides of the pool, as well as the trees on the mountain,</p>
<p>were all packed with people, making for a grand spectacle.</p>
<p>Athletes Not Afraid of the Cold</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the rain, the pool water was rather cold. Initially, when the number of people on the mountain was still sparse, it felt quite calm. As a result, upon seeing the pool water, there seemed to be a sense of reluctance. However, after several test swims, spirits were immediately lifted, and there was no fear of the cold whatsoever.</p>
<p>The athletes were indeed not afraid of the cold.</p>
<p>Liaoning Cheerleading Squad</p>
<p>Liaoning's Shi Xinglong made a name for himself by winning the one-mile race and showing great promise in the 440-yard race (and indeed, he won). Therefore, the Liaoning delegation specially formed male and female cheerleading squads, holding small flags with the characters "Liaoning" stitched on them, half black and half white, showing considerable ingenuity. The female cheerleaders wore neat uniforms, each with a foreign-style red-edged blue-trimmed woven rope garment, all in the same color, which looked very beautiful.</p>
<p>Beautiful to Watch in the Water</p>
<p>Among the swimming events was a diving competition. Originally scheduled as a preliminary round, it was changed to a final due to the small number of participants. This time, scores were not counted, only prizes were awarded. There were six participants in total, four from Hong Kong and two from Liaoning. They first attempted four specified diving styles, then four self-selected styles. Among them, Guo Fengzhen's various diving styles received the most applause and praise from the audience. Some walked into the water, others somersaulted continuously, each style different, some even bizarre. The male and female audience could not stop laughing.</p>
<h3>440-Yard Final</h3>
<p>First: Shi Xinglong (Liaoning)</p>
<p>Second: Chen Qisong (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Third: Song Yaode (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Fourth: None</p>
<p>Time: 6 minutes 37 seconds</p>
<p>Four-Person Final</p>
<p>The 440-yard freestyle final had only four participants, so everyone was guaranteed to score points. It was a pity that Chen Zhenxing ran out of steam after 100 yards and withdrew, which was a great shame. Therefore, only three people finished the race, and there was no fourth place.</p>
<p>Liaoning First</p>
<p>As expected by the audience, Shi Xinglong of Liaoning took the lead after swimming 100 yards in the 440-yard final. By 300 yards, Shi Xinglong was 40 yards ahead of the second-place finisher. By the end, Shi Xinglong was far in the lead.</p>
<h3>100-Yard Final</h3>
<p>First: Chen Zhenxing (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Second: Shi Xinglong (Liaoning)</p>
<p>Third: Huang Lieguang (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Fourth: Chen Qisong (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Time: 64 and 3/5 seconds</p>
<p>Because Chen Jinpei from Shanghai did not attend the 100-yard freestyle, there were only five participants, so it was changed to a final. Hong Kong occupied four of the five spots, but Shi Xinglong of Liaoning was not weak. Although Chen Zhenxing of Hong Kong won first place, Shi Xinglong was second, which is also commendable. Shi is good at both short and long distances and is truly a promising talent, but he is better at long distances than short distances. After swimming the 100 yards, Chen Zhenxing was already exhausted, while Shi seemed to be enjoying a delicious meal, only tasting it and not devouring it, not having fully enjoyed himself.</p>

<h3>Athletes Departing Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Already 268 People</p>
<p>As the National Games draws to a close, a portion of the athletes from various provinces and cities, having completed their competitions, are eager to return home.

<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>Crowded City: Yesterday, in addition to the track and field events, all the other venues held finals, which were exceptionally exciting. All elementary schools in Hangzhou were given a holiday to visit and watch the events, and the city was filled with people. The venues were packed, with deafening cheers. The final battles were of great importance, which is why the whole city was in an uproar.</p>
<p>Sense of Then and Now: The track and field venue was crowded with people the day before yesterday, which was very lively. Yesterday, because there were no competitions, the venue was deserted and silent, almost empty. Those who passed by the venue were filled with a sense of then and now.</p>
<p>Washing Feet in the Clear Stream: Miss Sun Guiyun, who came to the fore this time, has become the focus of attention from all sides. Miss Sun was very tired from the consecutive days of events, so yesterday she went to the lake with her friend Miss Wang Yuan and others to visit famous scenic spots such as Jiang Zhuang, Liu Zhuang, and Three Pools Mirroring the Moon. She encountered rain at Liu Zhuang and accidentally fell into the water. Could it be that because she is good at running and loves the cleanliness of the lake water, she wanted to wash away the dirt accumulated from running around at the venues for days?</p>
<p>Holding Flowers and Smiling: Shi Xinglong from Dalian, who won first place in the 240-yard swimming event, lingered behind after the swimming events were over and the audience had dispersed.</p>
<p>At that moment, the reporter from this newspaper came face to face with him and saw that he was holding a bouquet of fresh flowers and smiling happily, as if he couldn't contain his joy. One can imagine how sweet his heart was.</p>
<p>Triple Strike: Yesterday at 2 PM, during the men's basketball semi-final between Shanghai and Hong Kong, several female students from a certain school in Hangzhou were intently watching from the east side of the court. Unexpectedly, one of the balls from the Hong Kong team</p>
<p>fell on the head of one of the female students, causing a great uproar in the entire venue. Within minutes, two more balls fell in the same area, causing the female students to blush and quickly move away.</p>
<p>Tenfold Profit: Since the opening of the Games, more than 3,000 athletes from all over the country have come to Hangzhou. Although the organizing committee provided dormitories for the athletes to stay, due to the limited number of rooms and poor food, most of them chose to stay in hotels. Therefore, the large and small hotels around West Lake have been booming, making tenfold profits. However, outsiders often say that people from Hangzhou are good at ripping off others. At this time, the hotel owners, in order to make a profit, had to overcharge these outsiders.</p>
<p>Luck and Misfortune: Yesterday afternoon, the final football match between Nanjing and Shanghai was played, and the venue was filled with spectators as never before. Initially, the Shanghai team's performance was poor, but later they turned the tide, and the Nanjing team conceded two penalty kicks. However, during the first penalty kick, the goalkeeper of the Nanjing team slipped and fell, making no effect. During the second penalty kick, the goalkeeper slipped and fell face down, holding onto the ball with both hands. The same penalty kick, but there was luck and misfortune.</p>
<p>Heavily Surrounded: Within the venue, the Shanghai National Goods Machinery Factory Joint Association distributed the magazine "Machinery Association Journal," which was compiled and printed by the association, every day at the venue. The magazine's text was simple and interesting, and it was especially popular among elementary school students. Each time it was distributed, the person holding the magazine would be surrounded, unable to move forward or backward. Moreover, most of them were lively children, so it was impossible to refuse them with harsh words. Therefore, they were in a dilemma, unable to move forward.</p>
<h3>Philippine Man's Prediction of Far Eastern Games Titles Translated by Qian Yiqin</h3>
<p>Japan Will Win: Track and Field, Swimming, Tennis Titles</p>
<p>Philippines Will Win: Basketball, Volleyball Titles</p>
<p>China Will Win: Soccer Title</p>
<p>All-Around Ball is Key to the Title</p>
<p>People of Our Country, Urgently Need to Strive</p>
<p>This article was written by Dr. Regino R. Ylanan, a well-known executive of the Philippine Athletic Association, originally titled "Our Chances in The Olympi" and published in the third issue of the Philippine "Sports Weekly" this year. His views are unique. Taking advantage of the gathering of athletes from all over the country during the National Games in Hangzhou, I urgently translated it to serve as a stone from another mountain. When our athletes read it, they should consider how to work hard and encourage themselves.</p>
<p>Since the Far Eastern Games began until 1921, the host country has always won the Games title. For example, the Games in Manila in 1913 were won by the Philippines, the Games in Shanghai in 1915 were won by China, and the Games in Osaka in 1917 were won by Japan. These are all clear evidence. However, after the Games in Shanghai in 1921 and 1927 were won by the Philippines and Japan respectively, this sequence changed.</p>
<p>If we want to know the Philippines' chances in the next Games, there are several important factors that need to be studied in detail. Let's break them down: (1) Japan's rapid progress in various sports; (2) the prolongation of the Chinese civil war; (3) India's participation in the Far Eastern Games. Let's first talk about the first point. Japan has made great progress in track and field and swimming in recent years. Its performance in the World Summer Beak Games held in Amsterdam, Holland, and the performances held in Tokyo and Manchuria last year are amazing. To be fair, Japan is the only country that can compete with the strong United States in swimming at the next Summer Olympics. The same is true for tennis. Its players have defeated the world's best players. Therefore, Japan's strength in the Davis Cup will be even better than in the past.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the second point. Whenever the Games are held in another country, China has never had a full delegation attend. Now that the civil war is in full swing, it may not be possible to send many representatives to participate. China's strength lies in national sports, especially in soccer, basketball, and volleyball. In the previous Games, China had no position in track and field and swimming. Judging from the current results, China may not be able to share Japan's points in the next Games. The only sport in which it always wins is soccer. As for basketball and volleyball, it will inevitably compete with the Philippines as hard as possible.</p>
<p>Now let's discuss the third point. India's participation in the Games will cause considerable changes in the Games title. If India does send representatives to Tokyo this year, the number will not be large. This can be asserted. From an economic point of view alone, there is no difference in the cost of sending athletes to Japan and to the Philippines. However, if India does send a full delegation to attend, it will be harmful to China and Japan, but beneficial to the Philippines. This is because India is quite strong in soccer and may be able to seize China's authority and replace it. Its tennis players also have a reputation in the international arena. There are also many long-distance runners, and they often take away Japan's long-distance points in the Summer Olympics.</p>
<p>The decision of the Far Eastern Games overall title is based on the number of first places won in the events. The scoring method is a 5-3-1 system.</p>
<p>If there is a tie, the team with the highest score wins. According to the results of the previous Games and the performance of Chinese, Japanese, and Philippine athletes last season, Japan will win track and field, tennis, and swimming in the next Games, China will win soccer, and the Philippines will win basketball and volleyball. Baseball and all-around sports will be the final key to determining who wins the Games title.</p>

<h3>All-China Education Conference News</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th: There have been many requests to observe All-China Education Conference. The preparatory committee has determined to hold an executive meeting at 2 PM on the 10th to resolve the issue of observer tickets and the conference agenda. Zhang Boling, He Baoren, and Wu Leichuan have all sent letters to the Ministry of Education stating that they will not be able to attend the All-China Education Conference.</p>
<h3>Madam Huang Keqiang to Go Abroad Tomorrow</h3>
<p>To Inspect Education in Europe, America, and Southeast Asia</p>
<p>Madam Xu Zonghan, the wife of Huang Keqiang and the director of the Capital's First Education and Welfare Institute for Poor Children, has been commissioned by the Executive Yuan of the National Government to go to Europe, America, and Southeast Asia to inspect civilian education. She is scheduled to set sail tomorrow (11th) on the President Jefferson, accompanied by three staff members. In the future, Madam Xu's return to China will make a great contribution to our country's civilian education.</p>
<p>Madam Xu Zonghan, the wife of Huang Keqiang</p>
<h3>Complete Plan of the National Education Conference (III)</h3>
<p>C. How to prepare the necessary school buildings and equipment in classrooms, those who should receive supplementary education number 202,435,277 people, according to item B.</p>
<p>Adding the number of out-of-school youths, then primary school buildings and classrooms are already full day and night and cannot accommodate any more. Assuming each classroom holds fifty people, with two shifts taking turns to use it, that is, one classroom is needed for every one hundred people. The number of classrooms is exactly equal to the number of teachers, 112,470. Generally, a single-level public supplementary school should use two rooms with adequate air and light, suitable in height and size, one large room as a classroom and one small room as an office.</p>
<p>This is absolutely essential. Moreover, the Ministry of Education has promulgated the regulations for promoting industry (Note 3). The former University Council also issued a general order to all provinces and cities to use established institutions and organizations to establish public education (Note 4). In the future, the school buildings for adult supplementary education will inevitably become the center of social reform. Therefore, the school building is naturally also a problem.</p>
<p>D. How to raise the required funds. According to the survey, it costs at least one dollar and forty cents to train each graduate of a public school (Note 5).</p>
<p>Accordingly, the adult supplementary education funds required for more than 202 million people is 283.4 million yuan. The cost of teacher training is not included. Such a huge amount is naturally not easy to raise.</p>
<p>This must be designed separately.</p>
<p>(IV) Methods for Out-of-School Adults to Enter School for Supplementary Education and to Train Teachers</p>
<p>A. The number of illiterate people nationwide who should receive supplementary education is estimated to be 202,435,277, and the number of literate people is 87,218,990, as mentioned above. It is only necessary for each literate person to teach two and a half people to achieve complete universalization. Therefore, a mandatory order should be issued to illiterate people to make them learn, and a mobilization order should be issued to literate people to make them teach others to read. Their obligation to teach others to read is as important as the obligation to serve in the military and pay taxes. However, it is impossible to divide these 202 million illiterate people equally among the 87 million literate people to teach them. Therefore, this plan is to use a class-based national literacy school and a non-class-based national literacy center to complement each other.</p>
<p>B. What is the difference between a national literacy school and a national literacy center? If there are illiterate people in families, small shops, and other small-scale organizational groups, they can be guided by literate members of the family, shop, or group, without taking class-based lessons.</p>
<p>This is called a national literacy center, which is assessed by nearby primary schools. Each center has one director and several teachers, who are additionally hired by the principals of nearby primary schools. National literacy schools are established in the military, factories, prisons, and all large institutions, or places where there are dozens or more illiterate people. Other illiterate people who do not enter national literacy schools must organize national literacy centers.</p>
<p>C. The teachers of national literacy schools are drawn from county-level senior primary schools,</p>
<p>county-level normal schools, provincial normal schools, senior high school normal departments, military academies, and all secondary schools and above, which set up classes to recruit all students from their respective schools, giving them at least three weeks of training, and also recruit private school teachers and give them two months of training, which can barely be applied. The sources of these teachers are estimated as follows (Note 6):</p>
<p>(1) Students from secondary schools and above: 220,000</p>
<p>(2) Private school teachers: at least 200,000</p>
<p>(3) Senior primary school students: 580,000</p>
<p>The above does not include primary school teachers. The reason is given in item B of the previous section. Among them, half or one-third of items (1) and (3) graduate from school every year. Therefore, although there are 800,000 people, only 500,000 people can actually serve as adult supplementary education teachers each year. Private school teachers cannot be fully used; selecting one-quarter of the excellent ones can yield about 50,000 people. Together, there are 550,000 people, which is about four times the estimated number of teachers needed in item B of the previous section, 135,000, which is enough to rotate. Furthermore, there is the method of national literacy in item D below to adjust and remedy, so in any case, it can always be sufficient.</p>
<p>D. Teachers of national literacy centers are filled by literate members of their own families, shops, and institutions, and can be divided into two types:</p>
<p>(1) Primary school students: 7,000,000</p>
<p>(2) Literate adults: 73,000,000 (Note 7)</p>
<p>The total of the above numbers is 80 million people. It is estimated that if these 80 million teachers each teach two people, they can educate 160 million people in four months.</p>
<p>Literacy center teachers are trained by primary schools and improved private schools. The training period is two months. In this way, literate people teach and those who need supplementary education learn. Literate people seem to receive national training together with illiterate people.</p>
<p>E. The Ministry of Education establishes a central national literacy instructor training institute, taking the capital's national literacy movement as a pilot and training center, recruiting students with a senior high school education or above, enrolling students in two sessions each year, 80 to 100 people each time, graduating every six months, and sending them to various provinces in succession for long-term guidance and responsible for assessing results. In this way, each province will gain an average of three full-time adult supplementary education workers every six months. After six years, each province will have more than 30 people, which will be very convenient when the second phase of the plan is carried out in the future.</p>

<p>(V) Ways to Increase School Building Equipment</p>
<p>For the implementation of national literacy training, the school buildings required, in addition to the small number of people in national literacy centers and easier planning, the national literacy schools, estimated according to item C of the third section, each school needs at least two rooms. In addition to those shared with primary schools, the national 1,915 counties need an average of 589 schools per county. In cities, of course, public institutions can be used.</p>
<p>Charitable institutions, secondary schools and above, are not easy to find in rural areas and small towns. Although the area of ​​pavilions is small, they can also be used. Although tea shops have business relations, they can also be borrowed for one or two hours. As a last resort, temples, open spaces, can be used in spring and autumn on sunny days. This is temporary. On the one hand, primary school buildings should be built in remote rural areas as soon as possible, and the ancestral temples and temples originally borrowed as school buildings should be given up as places for adult supplementary education. The equipment can also be borrowed from the original ones. If it is an empty room, students should bring their own seats. In addition, private donations of houses can be encouraged, or funds can be donated to build school buildings, or the government can raise funds to build simple public education halls or farmer education halls to run public literacy education.</p>
<p>(VI) Budget and Allocation of Funds</p>
<p>First, the budget for funds. The funds required for the implementation of adult supplementary education mentioned above is about 283.4 million yuan. This number is obtained from proportional calculation. How much is the exact amount? It is necessary to make a practical estimate as follows:</p>
<p>Budget for National Literacy Training Expenses</p>
<p>Subject Expenditure</p>
<p>First item: Implementation of National Literacy 56,587,440</p>
<p>Training expenses in yuan</p>
<p>The numbers listed above are the annual requirements.</p>
<p>First sub-item: Printing fee 3,706,100</p>
<p>First entry: Thousand-Character Textbook 168,70</p>
<p>Assuming each book is shared by two people, each book is used in three terms, and there are more than 224 million people, about 33.74 million books are needed in total. The printing fee for each book is 3 cents, totaling 1,012,200 yuan. Divided into six years, the annual requirement is about the above number.</p>
<p>Second sub-item: Public Weekly 2,700,000</p>
<p>Assuming each copy is shared by 30 people, about 6.75 million copies are needed. The printing fee for each copy is 1 cent per issue, 40 issues per year, totaling 4 jiao. The total requirement is about the above number.</p>
<p>Third sub-item: Literacy National Certificate 337,400</p>
<p>33.74 million people are trained each year, one copy per person, one cent per copy, totaling the above number.</p>
<p>Fourth sub-item: Patriotic Award Certificate 500,000</p>
<p>According to item D of section 4, there may be 80 million teachers in the public literacy center.</p>
<p>Assuming one-fifth of them are awarded each term, 16 million certificates should be prepared, 48 million certificates each year in three terms. Based on 50 million certificates, the printing fee for each certificate is 1 cent, totaling the above number.</p>
<p>Second item: Stationery fee 2,250,000</p>
<p>Assuming each set is used in three shifts, about 11.25 million sets are needed each year. Each set is 2 jiao, totaling about the above number.</p>
<p>Third item: Teacher salaries 33,741,000</p>
<p>According to the number of teachers in the National Literacy School in item B of section 3, there are 112,470 people. The average annual salary for each person is 300 yuan, totaling the above number.</p>
<p>Fourth item: Central National Literacy Guide 15,000</p>
<p>Member Training Fee</p>
<p>First entry: Recurring expenses 10,000</p>
<p>According to item E of section 4, the average training fee for each student is 100 yuan per year, totaling the above number.</p>
<p>Second entry: Start-up fee 5,000</p>
<p>The start-up fee totals 30,000 yuan, with an annual average requirement of the above number in six years.</p>
<p>Fifth item: Central National Literacy Guidance 660,000</p>
<p>Member Salary and Travel Expenses</p>
<p>The first half year is free. From the second half of the first year, there are 100 people, from the second year, there are 200 people, and from the second half of the third year, there are 300 people. The number increases accordingly.</p>
<p>100 yuan per person per month, totaling 3.96 million yuan for six years.</p>
<p>The annual average is the above number.</p>
<p>Sixth item: County and city training knowledge 1,149,000</p>
<p>Character teacher expenses</p>
<p>There are a total of 1,915 counties in the country, with an annual calculation of 600 yuan per county, totaling the above number.</p>
<p>Seventh item: School building expenses 5,623,500</p>
<p>No expenses are incurred for borrowing. However, according to the compulsory education plan, the repair and opening equipment fee is about 500 yuan per school. Borrowing tables and chairs or students preparing their own can reduce 200 yuan. Calculated at 300 yuan, 112,470 schools need a total of 33,741,000 yuan. The annual average fundraising in six years needs the above number.</p>
<p>Eighth item: Maintenance fee and miscellaneous expenses 6,748,200</p>
<p>Chalk, lighting, tea, office stationery, etc., 5 yuan per school per month.</p>
<p>The annual requirement is the above number.</p>
<p>Ninth item: Reserve fee 2,694,640</p>
<p>The reserve fee is calculated at 5% of the total of the first to eighth items listed above, requiring the above number.</p>
<p>Second, allocation of funds. The above budget can be considered a relatively accurate number (about 1.65 yuan per student per year, including teacher training, which is only 16% different from the estimated 1.4 yuan in item D of the previous section). In terms of nature, it is used to carry out local national literacy training, and it seems that the local government should bear it. However, according to the current financial situation of the local government, it is absolutely impossible to bear this cost completely. Therefore, it is appropriate for the central and local governments to share the burden.</p>
<p>Referring to the compulsory education example in Chapter 1, the sharing standard is formulated as follows:</p>
<p>Central government: Bears 45% of the total amount</p>
<p>Provincial government: Bears 10% of the total amount</p>
<p>County government: Bears 45% of the total amount</p>
<p>According to the above standards, the total amount borne by the central and local governments is as follows:</p>
<p>Central government: Should bear 25,464,348 yuan annually</p>
<p>Provincial government: Should bear 5,658,744 yuan annually</p>
<p>County government: Should bear 25,464,348 yuan annually</p>
<p>Total: 56,587,440 yuan</p>
<p>The number that the provincial government should raise, except for Tibet, Suiyuan, Rehe, Chahar, Ningxia, Xikang, Qinghai, and other six provinces, which have special circumstances and should be designed separately, if shared by the remaining 22 provinces such as Jiangsu, calculated, each province bears an average of more than 250,000 yuan per year. Also, the number that the county government should raise is temporarily allocated according to the current number of counties and cities in the country, 2,000 (Note 8). Each county should raise an average of more than 12,500 yuan per year. However, the population, financial resources, and environment of each county are different, so how can they be the same? Therefore, the number of counties to bear can also be assumed as in the table below:</p>
<p>First-class counties: 15,000 yuan to 25,000 yuan</p>
<p>Second-class counties: 5,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan</p>
<p>Third-class counties: Below 5,000 yuan</p>
<p>(VII) Methods for Editing National Literacy Teaching Materials</p>
<p>First, the Ministry of Education should compile a Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Textbook in the shortest possible time, so that ordinary people can complete it in four months, one hour per day.</p>
<p>Second, the textbook compiled in the previous article should use a mixed compilation method, with phonetic symbols attached to promote Mandarin Chinese. In addition to focusing on the Three Principles of the People, the teaching materials should also cover common sense.</p>
<p>Third, the Ministry of Education should edit the Public Weekly based on the vocabulary of the first book of the Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Textbook and 20% new words, so that those who have completed the first book of the Thousand-Character Textbook can easily read it.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Ministry of Education should edit the Public Series of Books based on the vocabulary of the Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Textbook and 20% new words.</p>
<p>Fifth, the above publications are allowed to be reprinted by bookstores nationwide, and the price should be extremely low.</p>
<p>(VIII) Procedures for Implementing Universalization</p>
<p>First, organize specialized responsible agencies. Before implementing compulsory education, each county and city should first organize a National Literacy Training Committee and branches, as well as offices, etc., as specialized responsible agencies. The system is as follows:</p>
<p>County: Committee, District: Branch, Township or Town: Branch, Hamlet: Office, At least one office per hamlet.</p>
<p>The organization of each association and office, as well as the selection of committee members, are shown in the table below:</p>
<p>County Committee District Branch Township or Town Branch Hamlet Office</p>
<p>County Education Bureau Chief District Chief Township Chief or Town Chief Hamlet Chief</p>
<p>One representative of the County Chief One representative of the District Education Association One representative of the District Education Association Appointed by the Hamlet Chief</p>
<p>One representative of the County Education Bureau One representative of the District Party Department Representatives jointly recommended by each district branch in the district Two literate people from the hamlet</p>
<p>Appointed by the Education Bureau, one to three people who are enthusiastic about national literacy training Appointed by the District Chief, two people who are enthusiastic about national literacy training Appointed by the Township Chief or Town Chief, two people who are enthusiastic about national literacy training</p>
<p>A total of five to seven people A total of five people A total of five people A total of three people</p>
<p>The above associations and offices, except in special circumstances, should all be established before the scheduled implementation period in each locality and reported to the Provincial Department of Education for record. In places where the district, township, and town system has not yet been implemented, the city and township directors and village chiefs may be temporarily responsible.</p>
<p>Second, conduct surveys in stages. After the establishment of the above agencies, conduct implementation surveys. The targets of the survey are two:</p>
<p>A. The number and names of teachers in the district.</p>
<p>B. The names, addresses, and total number of illiterate people in the district.</p>
<p>The survey should be conducted in the following order:</p>
<p>(1) Survey starts from the hamlet, the hamlet chief should investigate and register two copies two and a half months before the local implementation period, one to be submitted to the township or town branch, and one to be kept in the hamlet.</p>
<p>(2) The township or town branch must compile the reports from each hamlet two months before the local implementation period and prepare a concise summary report in two copies, one to be submitted to the district branch and one to be kept in the township or town.</p>
<p>(3) The district branch must compile the reports from each subordinate township and town one and a half months before the local implementation period and prepare a concise summary report in two copies,</p>
<p>one to be submitted to the county committee and one to be kept in the district.</p>
<p>(4) The county committee must compile the reports from each subordinate district one month before the county implementation period and prepare a concise summary report in two copies, one to be submitted to the Provincial Department of Education and one to be kept in the committee.</p>
<p>Third, allocate teachers and students and notify them separately.</p>
<p>A. One month before the compulsory implementation period, all hamlets should mobilize simultaneously.</p>
<p>Except for places where the number of students is over fifty, which is enough to set up a school, a school should be set up immediately. For those who cannot set up a school, the names of teachers and students should be allocated one by one according to the standard of one teacher for every three students.</p>
<p>Issue a notice and announce it in the hamlet.</p>
<p>B. If there are not enough teachers, the upper-level branch may be requested to dispatch qualified teachers for assistance.</p>
<p>C. Those who have the obligation to teach may be exempted from their obligation if they have special circumstances and are certified by the head of the agency or the hamlet chief, but they must pay a donation of three yuan for teaching literacy to be deposited in the hamlet office as the cost of hiring someone to teach in their place.</p>
<p>D. If there is a surplus of teachers in the hamlet, the hamlet office should register the names and addresses of the surplus teachers and report them to the township and town branch for dispatch to other hamlets where there is a shortage of teachers.</p>
<p>E. Distribute the supplies separately.</p>
<p>9. Scheduled Compulsory Period and Post-Compulsory Assessment</p>
<p>First, an order was issued on July 1, 1919 of the Republic of China, announcing to the national public that the Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Textbook must be completed before the end of December of the 25th year. A second announcement was issued on September 1.</p>
<p>Second, compulsory implementation began in cities, towns, and villages on January 1, 1920 of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Third, compulsory implementation began in the provincial capitals, cities, towns, and villages of each province on January 1, 1921 of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Fourth, compulsory implementation began in the cities, towns, and villages of first-class and second-class counties on January 1, 1923 of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Fifth, compulsory implementation began in the cities, towns, and villages of third-class counties on January 1, 1925 of the Republic of China. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Last Night</h3>
<p>German Industrial Delegation Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Will Enter Beijing Within a Few Days</p>
<p>German Minister Also Arrives Today</p>
<p>The German industrial delegation of eight people, invited by the National Government to come to China for inspection, inspected Guangzhou for a week and then took the German mail ship Telflinger of Mei Zuishi Foreign Company from Hong Kong on the 10th to Shanghai. They arrived in port at 10 o'clock last night. The ship docked at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou. After all the members of the delegation landed, they stayed at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road. The Chinese agencies that went to the boat to welcome them last night included Xu Shanxiang, representative of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Yang Gongzhao, representative of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines, Zhang Yunhai, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhu Chongguang, representative of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Shen Yi, Xu Peihuang, representatives of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, Hu Shuhua, representative of Tongji University, and Tan Boyu. The Shanghai Special Municipal Government has scheduled a banquet this afternoon to welcome all the members of the delegation and introduce the two sides to meet.</p>
<p>The formal public banquet will be held after the delegation goes to Beijing and returns to Shanghai at a later date.</p>
<p>Mission to China, a reporter from this newspaper visited the delegation at the Hua Mao Hotel last night and was met by the head of the delegation, Mr. Le Ciman.</p>
<p>He told the reporter that his mission to China was that he had been in China for more than 20 years and returned to Germany seven years ago. He was very happy to revisit the old place. The German industrial inspection delegation is purely composed of representatives of important industrial circles in Germany. The motivation for their visit to China</p>
<p>originated when Sun Ke, Minister of Railways of the National Government, visited Germany two years ago. At that time, Minister Sun had contacted the German industrial delegation and welcomed the German industrial circles to invest in China to develop various industries in China, so as to seek cooperation between the economic circles of China and Germany. After Minister Sun returned to China, he sent a telegram on behalf of the National Government, formally inviting the German industrial circles to organize a delegation to China to observe the economic and industrial conditions in South China</p>
<p>and North China, and then formulate a development plan.</p>
<p>Consult with each other before investing. He believes that the only prerequisite for industrial development is peace.</p>

<p>The First Batch of Zhejiang</p>
<h3>Immigrants Will Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai on the 20th</p>
<p>Will Transfer to the Northeast Immediately</p>
<p>Last year, there was a famine in eastern Zhejiang, and more than 40 counties were affected. The Zhejiang Provincial Government sent Pan Gengsheng, the magistrate of Hangzhou County, to Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces to conduct on-site investigations for immigration and border colonization. The first batch of disaster victims who have been reported to have arrived will leave the customs in late this month. Yesterday, the Zhejiang Provincial Government sent a letter to various shipping companies in Shanghai for the transfer matters.</p>
<p>The letter stated that according to reports from various counties, there are already 400 households of reclaimed people, about 1,450 people. It is planned to send transportation staff from various places such as Wutai Ning Shao on the 15th of this month,</p>
<p>to lead them in separate groups, take commercial ships, and be allowed to arrive in Shanghai on the 20th, and then wait for ships in Shanghai to be transported to the port for landing. The matter of transferring disaster victims to colonize the border is not only to relieve the poor,</p>
<p>but also is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. All shipping companies should be happy to assist. All the aforementioned disaster victims' resettlement, the free method of taking ships for departure, or allocating ships for special delivery, to facilitate the progress, in addition to sending personnel to contact, another notice is issued. In addition,</p>
<p>the Municipal Government sent a letter saying that the immigrants will be sent to Shanghai at the end of April to wait for ships to depart for the Northeast. Commissioner Zhou Botong was specially appointed to contact Zhoushan, Ping An, Taizhou, Da Xing, and Yili shipping companies on the Shen Tai line in this port,</p>
<p>to discuss free boat rides. The Lian An Shipping Conference decided that those who take ships from Haimen, Shipu, Dinghai, Chuanshan, and other places in Zhejiang Province will be transported by Zhoushan, Dahua, Chuanshan, Da Xing, and Taizhou shipping companies, and those who depart from Kanmen in Wenzhou will be transferred by Yili shipping company. The fare will be charged at half price, and children under seven years old will be free, and those over seven years old will be charged according to the amount. As for the immigrants boarding the ship, after counting the number of people according to the immigrant register, the county government will be notified, and the cash will be paid at that time. The Public Security Bureau will issue a notice to Yongjia, Linhai, Xiangshan, Dinghai, Zhenhai, and other county governments to follow suit. As for the Hu Hang line, it is transported by inland river ships. What should be decided at present is the Ning Shao area,</p>
<p>and the Shanghai Ningbo line will contact Sanbei, China Merchants, and Ning Shao companies. It will be decided today and then implemented to transport them to Shen. After arriving in Shanghai, China Merchants and others will send them to Yingkou.</p>
<p>Social Bureau</p>
<h3>Proclamation to Maintain People's Food Supply</h3>
<p>Rice Merchants Ordered to Suppress Prices to Eighteen Yuan</p>
<p>Rice Shops Ordered to Reduce Selling Prices Again</p>
<p>According to a report from the Wuchen Society, rice arriving in southern Shanghai yesterday has not ceased. Sales of Jiangsu and Tongbai japonica rice are relatively smooth, with the price falling by one dime. Songjiang's thin rice paddy, due to its weakened digestion, also dropped by a dime. The asking prices of other Qingjiao thin rice paddy and Changbang japonica rice are lower than the previous day. If clear weather brings a rush of goods, the rice market can stabilize, preventing further changes. However, foreign rice is still rising strongly, as inland purchases are very active.</p>
<p>Procurement in Ningbo and Wenzhou is particularly urgent. The Zhabei rice market has become lively, with over 3,000 shi sold yesterday, and prices have fallen by half a dime. Top-grade Qingpu thin rice paddy is selling for nineteen yuan. However, the prices published in newspapers do not specify grades or sources, resulting in a difference of one or several yuan compared to the southern market. The Social Bureau is deeply concerned that some people are obscuring the situation and raising prices. Yesterday, it ordered the Bean and Rice Trade Association, the Shanghai Northern Rice Grain Sales Association, and the Jiagutang Rice Industry Association to advise their members not to raise prices again during this period of falling rice prices and to find ways to lower them further. The highest price for top-grade japonica rice is set at</p>
<p>eighteen yuan. Furthermore, as flour is an essential supplementary food, yesterday, the Flour Mill Association was instructed to inform its members not to take advantage of the situation by raising prices or monopolizing goods. The bureau also reported that the Zhabei Rice Grain Sales Association reported that rice boats transporting rice from Wangting to Shanghai were detained in Suzhou. A request was submitted to the mayor to forward a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to negotiate the matter. Details of the entire text and the negotiations regarding the detained rice are recorded below:</p>
<p>Order to the Bean and Rice Trade Association and the Sales Association, to be obeyed. According to today's newspaper, boat owner Ding Fugen of the Zhabei rice market is asking nineteen yuan for his thin rice paddy. In addition, the lowest price of the four households of Zhang, Tang, Xu, and Song is also eighteen yuan. Furthermore, boat owner Hua Zuozhou is asking nineteen yuan and forty-five cents for ordinary japonica rice, while the other two households of Ding and Pei are also asking above nineteen yuan and twenty-five cents. However, the highest price of japonica rice in the southern Shanghai rice market is seventeen yuan and eighty cents, and the highest price of thin rice paddy is seventeen yuan and seventy cents. Within the same region, on the same day, the northern and southern</p>
<p>rice markets are so disparate as to be alarming. Even if the quality of the rice is superior, a slightly higher price should be stated to avoid shaking the market.</p>
<p>Moreover, generalizing as "ordinary japonica rice" without distinguishing sources and grades is even more likely to breed misunderstandings and lead to the clandestine sale of top-grade japonica rice at high prices. Such a lack of distinction between high and low grades clearly has the drawback of undermining price limits and should be strictly admonished to serve as a warning. If there is no repentance, severe punishment will be given. You are to immediately inform all merchants and boat owners to comply.</p>
<p>As for top-grade japonica rice, the price limit of eighteen yuan should have been in effect from the eighth. However, representatives Ye Huijun and Jiang Shizhi from the association came to the bureau to explain their difficulties, which seemed genuine. A few more days will be granted.</p>
<p>You are still instructed to find ways to lower prices immediately. The highest price for top-grade japonica rice is eighteen yuan, and other rice types should not delay and wait,</p>
<p>intending to test the waters, which would be inconvenient. This is a strict order.</p>
<p>Order to the Jiagutang Public Office, to be obeyed. According to today's newspaper, members of the office are publicly discussing rice prices, with special japonica rice priced at twenty yuan, and the first and second grades of rice are all above nineteen yuan. Recent rice prices have gradually declined, and you, Ye, should lower prices accordingly based on the overall market. How can you still ask prices based on the rice market several days ago? This special order instructs the public office to fairly set prices for sale by referring to the current market to benefit the people's food supply and not to deliberately raise prices and hinder the livelihoods of ordinary people. You are also instructed to truthfully submit the prices of the special, first, second, and third grades of japonica rice for March for review. This order.</p>
<p>Order to the Flour Mill Association, to be obeyed. In recent times, rice prices have soared, causing panic among the people. This bureau is prepared to consider the commercial situation and people's livelihoods and provide proper maintenance. The rice market has recently stabilized, and people's hearts have been somewhat calmed. However, due to the thinness of grain production, people still feel difficulties with their food supply. As flour is an essential supplementary food, there is still fear that a few merchants, seeing the high price of rice, will take the opportunity to raise prices or monopolize goods, hoping to profit, which would hinder the people's food supply and endanger security. You are immediately ordered to inform your members to share the difficulties of the times, find ways to increase supply, and sell at fair prices, and not to engage in the aforementioned situations, which would lead to investigation. This order.</p>
<p>Negotiations on Detained Rice in Wangting: The Social Bureau reported that the Zhabei Rice Grain Sales Association reported that its member Long Hongji was transporting rice from Wangting to Shanghai and was detained by the Suzhou Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team. Similar situations have also been reported. It is said that Suzhou's detention of rice boats transporting rice to Shanghai is not a one-time occurrence. At this time of poor rice production, everyone feels that the people's food supply is insufficient. It depends on whether neighboring areas can communicate with each other, help each other in times of emergency, and overcome difficulties together. Now, the inland areas ignore the food supply of this city and treat it as an enemy country, repeatedly stopping rice sales. If the city is unable to make up for the shortage of inland rice supply and is forced to ban the export of foreign rice to ensure its own survival, what will be the panic of the inland people's food supply? These situations have been reported to Mayor Zhang, who has forwarded a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to pay attention, determine a mutually supportive and coexisting approach, and immediately</p>
<p>release the detained rice boats heading to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Baoshan County Organizes Rice Price Stabilization Sales</h3>
<p>Baoshan County Magistrate Wu Jia felt that rice prices were rising daily, making it difficult for poor people to make a living. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, he convened all district chiefs in the county for a special meeting at the county government. The attending district chiefs included Sun Qixian, Yang Weixiong, Lu Fengpu, Yan Guang'en, Wang Qingtao, etc.</p>
<p>Chaired by County Magistrate Wu, the results of the discussion and resolutions were as follows: (1) Simultaneous organization of price stabilization sales in all five districts of the county, (2) tentative budget of 25,000 yuan, (3) fixed start-up fee of 5,000 yuan per district, (4) more than 10,000 yuan of the original accumulated grain funds will be transferred to price stabilization sales, with any shortfall to be raised by each district, (5)</p>
<p>Preparation will begin immediately, and implementation will commence.</p>
<h3>National Goods Maintenance Association Sends Telegram Regarding People's Hardships</h3>
<p>Requesting Swift Stabilization of Rice Prices and Suppression of Local Bandits</p>
<p>Commerce, society, and people's livelihoods are suffering greatly. A special telegram is sent to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting concrete relief. The telegram reads, "To Minister Niu of the Ministry of Interior and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government Executive Yuan: Recently, rice prices in Shanghai have reached beyond twenty yuan. Although they have slightly decreased recently,</p>
<p>it is still difficult for them to fall significantly. How can the common people bear this? Social panic has reached its peak. In addition, bandits are rampant, and petty thieves</p>
<p>are rising up.</p>
<p>Travelers are hesitant, viewing it as a fearful path. Recent readings of various newspapers show that</p>
<p>robberies with guns and kidnapping are frequent in the poor and remote areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, poisoning residents and escalating more and more. Alas, it is not easy for our common people to make a living, and it is difficult to sleep soundly. Who created this terrible situation?</p>
<p>It has come to this. After each meeting we convene, we hear the statements of various factory representatives. Various hardships are reported, such as businesses declining, expenses increasing daily, and difficulty in maintaining operations. It is difficult to continue, but it is impossible to stop, with constant constraints and difficulties in advancing and retreating. There is much suffering.</p>
<p>It will not stop until both sides are defeated and perish together. Those who speak are heartbroken, and those who hear are saddened. The phenomenon is like this, and wanting to revitalize national goods</p>
<p>is truly going south by driving the chariot north. The suffering of the people's livelihood is like this, and the decline of industry is like that. Society is not peaceful. What day will disaster come? All these aspects have a very important and close relationship with security and the foundation of the country. Our association, seeing the situation worsening daily and the difficulties of businesses reaching their peak, boldly sends this telegram to request that Your Excellencies have pity on these children and provide relief, and request that it be forwarded to the National Government to swiftly formulate measures to stabilize rice prices and concretely implement them. The suppression of local bandits must be comprehensively considered and jointly suppressed to eradicate the roots. Do not treat neighbors as</p>
<p>enemies, leaving endless troubles. This will allow the people to have security and live and work in peace. This will not only make the people of the two provinces extremely grateful. This special telegram is submitted with utmost sincerity. We humbly request your examination and acceptance and immediate implementation.</p>
<p>We are deeply fearful and await your command. Wang Jie'an, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqiang, Standing Committee Members of the China National Goods Maintenance Association, bow in unison.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia</p>
<h3>An Appeal to Eliminate Private Postal Bureaus</h3>
<p>Various organizations in Singapore are sending letters and telegrams, exerting every effort to appeal for the elimination of private postal bureaus (Minxinju) by both Chinese and foreign authorities. A summary of these appeals is as follows:</p>
<p>Urgent Telegram on Behalf of Various Organizations, to the Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Shanghai Overseas Chinese United Association, National Federation of Commerce, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Overseas Chinese Advancement Association, National Chambers of Commerce, Newspaper Offices, and Community Organizations. Published in the Shanghai Shen Bao, February 28th. The Director-General of the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications, in a statement to a reporter from the Guomin News Agency, regarding the issue of private postal bureaus in Nanyang (Southeast Asia) handling general package delivery, is deceiving overseas Chinese and misleading the Chinese people. Upon reading this, we are deeply saddened. We hereby list the details of the petition to eliminate private postal bureaus and increase postal rates, along with the background, and refute the statement as follows: (1) The Director-General of the Postal Administration stated that in August of the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the postal administration of British Malaya in Kuala Lumpur sent a telegram stating that the governments of the Malay Peninsula and various islands in Nanyang had decided to abolish the private postal bureau system and would implement it on January 1st of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), and that a letter was sent on September 2nd reiterating the request for abolition, etc. As such, it seems that the abolition of private postal bureaus originated from the British territory.</p>
<p>However, the true facts are quite different. In October of the 15th year of the Republic (1926), the Ministry of Communications in Beijing had once issued an order to abolish private postal packages, but after the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, representing all overseas Chinese, appealed to the Chinese and foreign authorities, it was granted an indefinite extension. Subsequently, after the unification of the North in the 17th year of the Republic (1928) and the establishment of our National Government, in November, the Shantou Postal Bureau suddenly issued new regulations prohibiting private postal bureaus from sending or receiving general packages via mail. On February 26th of the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the Chamber of Commerce again strongly argued based on the previous case, and on April 23rd, they received Approval No. 65 from the Ministry of Communications, which stated, in brief, that private postal bureaus should not exist permanently, nor was an indefinite extension necessary, thus overturning the established case.</p>
<p>This aroused outrage among overseas Chinese. On July 13th, a general meeting of all overseas Chinese was convened in the Chamber of Commerce, unanimously advocating for continued petitions, with letters and telegrams being sent back and forth, repeatedly appealing the decision. The news spread, prompting local governments to pay extra attention. The Secretary for Chinese Affairs repeatedly inquired with the directors of the Chamber of Commerce. If the Ministry of Communications had not issued a directive stating that private postal bureaus should not exist and should be abolished, there would have been no general meeting of all overseas Chinese, nor would it have aroused the suspicion of the local government. Where did the telegrams and letters from the Kuala Lumpur Postal Administration in August and September originate? It is not hard to imagine. The facts are clear and documented. Who would believe that it did not originate from our own country? (2) This can also be proven by the petition presented by the "Singapore Overseas Chinese General Meeting for Petitioning to Retain Private Postal Bureaus" on October 13th of the 18th year of the Republic (1929), which stated, in part, that "Postal bureaus in Singapore, Malacca, and other places that require private postal bureaus to obtain licenses for operation have recently expired and are said to be ceasing to renew them,</p>
<p>and upon inquiring about the reasons, they cite the fact that our country's postal service has already abolished private postal bureaus as a reason, and state that if our government still agrees to retain them, there would be no problem on their end and licenses would definitely be issued as before." However, the Ministry of Communications has not provided any reply or explanation to this, further increasing the confusion among overseas Chinese. It was not until the representatives met with the Governor of Singapore that they learned that the Director-General of the Postal Administration had taken the initiative to correspond with the Postmaster General of Kuala Lumpur to discuss the abolition, and the overseas Chinese then realized the reason for the Ministry of Communications' lack of response and explanation. (3) This year, when representatives met with the Governor of Singapore to petition for a reduction in fees, the Postmaster General of Kuala Lumpur was also present and presented a letter from the Director-General of our country's Postal Administration, which included (1) requesting the Postmaster General of Kuala Lumpur to cease renewing licenses for private postal bureaus in Singapore and other places in 1930, (2) stating that a commissioner had been appointed to order private postal bureaus in Shantou and Xiamen to send overseas letters and affix postage stamps of one cent according to regulations, (3) stating that the joint postal system would definitely be able to be practically implemented. According to the letter, he spoke grandly,</p>
<p>directly claiming to be in compliance with the international postal convention. However, what is incomprehensible is that while he requested the Postmaster General of Kuala Lumpur to stop issuing licenses to private postal bureaus in 1930, he embellished his words when talking to reporters, saying that his goal was to ensure that the communication of overseas Chinese would not be inconvenienced by the abolition of private postal bureaus by the British postal service. This is contradictory and self-deceptive. If licenses are stopped, private postal bureaus will be closed, so how can communication be made convenient for overseas Chinese? Moreover, if the joint postal system is to be implemented, fundamental planning for postal services should also be initiated. Is transportation convenient in the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong? Has the population been registered? Are there post offices in remote rural areas? Are bandits rampant everywhere? Has the Director-General of the Postal Administration considered this? If he only focuses on increasing fees, claiming that this would both avoid criticism for not complying with the international postal convention and increase postal revenue, while ignoring the suffering of overseas Chinese and disregarding their earnest pleas, is this the attitude that a communications authority that claims to care for overseas Chinese and facilitate the public should have? Based on the above three points, the situation is already clear.</p>
<p>Yet the Director-General of the Postal Administration claims that it "runs counter to the facts." On what basis does he say this? If he claims to have sent a telegram to the British authorities to inquire, then the British authorities must have replied. He should present the original text of the correspondence to clarify the truth. Otherwise, he will be guilty of harming the country and the people. The overseas Chinese feel deeply pained as their families' lives depend on this. Now that there is no way to appeal, we are again presenting the details and tearfully requesting our Central Party Headquarters</p>
<p>and the National Government to uphold Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, earnestly protect overseas Chinese, and alleviate their suffering. We also hope that our compatriots in the country will sympathize with the difficulties of overseas Chinese and unite to protest, awaiting your urgent command.</p>
<p>Singapore Organizations Petitioning for the Reduction of Private Postal Fees, Overseas Chinese General Meeting, respectfully presented by Delegation Chairman Lin Jin Dian.</p>
<p>March 15th, Year 19 of the Republic.</p>
<p>An Open Letter to Compatriots at Home and Abroad,</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
<p>Last May, our Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce received a directive from the Ministry of Communications stating that private postal bureaus should not exist permanently and that there was no need for an indefinite extension.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Upon hearing this, our overseas Chinese were deeply troubled and rushed about. Overseas and domestic private postal bureaus are intrinsically linked, serving as a major institution needed by overseas Chinese to send money and letters to support their families. If private postal bureaus in Shantou and Xiamen are forced to close, overseas private postal bureaus will also have to close simultaneously. Although post offices can be used for communication,</p>
<p>the lack of convenience would be difficult for overseas Chinese to bear. Therefore, we petitioned for their retention. We were deeply grateful when the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Communications to temporarily suspend the measure. However, last year, the Postal Administration suddenly appointed officials to order private postal bureaus in Shantou and Xiamen to affix postage stamps of one cent to each letter sent overseas. At the same time, the local government</p>
<p>also began to abolish them, requiring each letter to have a postage stamp of one cent and two cents affixed. According to the usual rates for private postal letters, each letter sent abroad costs three cents, and each general package of forty letters sent domestically costs twenty-eight cents. Now, both governments are requiring adherence to the postal regulations, which is too heavy a burden and causes great suffering to our people. However, when elected representatives approached the local government to request a reduction, they were told that the abolition and increased fees were advocated by our government. What are the intentions of the ruling officials? We overseas Chinese are ignorant and dare not speculate.</p>
<p>Because the local government is implementing the fee increase, scheduled for April 1st, the lighterage industry association was compelled to appeal. Sixty-three organizations participated, holding a general meeting of overseas Chinese at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce on the 23rd of last month. The attendees were crowded, unanimously advocating for continued petitions, and immediately</p>
<p>established the "Singapore Organizations Petitioning for Reduction of Private Postal Fees, Overseas Chinese General Meeting." On one hand, we earnestly requested the local government for a four-month extension to allow for discussion and negotiation. On the other hand, we publicly nominated Mr. Lu Weisheng, a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central Government, as the petition representative. Over the past few days, over fifty telegrams have been sent from various clan associations, community organizations, the Malacca Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and the Singapore Overseas Chinese General Meeting,</p>
<p>but all have been ignored. Overseas Chinese have always loved their country and contributed funds, not wanting to be outdone by others. The facts are all there and should be trusted by compatriots throughout the country. We have secretly hoped that after unification, everything would be renewed, and the suffering previously experienced by overseas Chinese might be alleviated once and for all. But now, the suffering is compounded and the pain intensified, the opposite of what we expected, which is beyond our expectations. If the abolition of private postal bureaus is intended to comply with international postal conventions, then the fundamental task is to facilitate transportation, register the population, and eliminate bandits. Only then can what is taken from the people also benefit the people. Now, without attending to these tasks, the remittances of overseas Chinese still rely on private postal bureaus for delivery, and labor costs must inevitably be subsidized, resulting in a double burden. How can countless laborers, who toil like oxen and barely earn a meager sum of sweat and blood to support their families, endure this? Now, with exhausted strength and hoarse voices, we must remotely appeal to various newspapers, community organizations, and compatriots at home and abroad to unite and strive to have the Ministry of Communications withdraw its decision and handle matters as before. In addition to sending a telegram on this day, we are also submitting a letter</p>
<p>to request that you investigate and appeal on our behalf. We cannot express our sincere plea enough. With best wishes.</p>
<p>Singapore Organizations Petitioning for Reduction of Private Postal Fees, Overseas Chinese General Meeting,</p>
<p>Delegation Chairman Lin Jin Dian, March 15th, Year 19 of the Republic.</p>
<p>Petition from Various Organizations, To His Excellency Sir Clementi, Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Straits Settlements. The petitioners Lin Jin Dian, Li Jin Ci, Luo Cheng De, Wang Sheng Shi, Zhuang Du Ding, Tang Xiang Lin, Huang Qin Sheng, et al., respectfully submit the following: (1) Overseas Chinese in this locality who send money and letters to their families in rural areas of mainland China generally do so using the general package method. That is, the remitter hands over the money and letters to their families to the local private postal bureau. The private postal bureau assembles hundreds or thousands of similar letters into a general package. Each letter in the general package pays a postage fee of three cents, which the post office then forwards to its branch offices on the Chinese coast. After delivery, the branch office then distributes the money and letters to the recipients in various inland villages and towns, while collecting return letters or receipts, which are assembled into a general package and sent back to the local private postal bureau. (2) Last year, the Chinese government indicated its intention to abolish the private postal bureau system. Overseas Chinese in this locality,</p>
<p>held a general meeting at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and elected representatives to petition the National Government. As a result, the National Government agreed to allow private postal bureaus to continue operating as before.</p>
<p>(3) At the end of last year, the Secretary for Chinese Affairs of this locality notified us that the local government would increase the postage fee for general packages from three cents per letter to the standard fee of one cent and two cents per letter. (4) After receiving the notification, the committee immediately appointed four representatives to meet with the Acting Governor of Singapore on January 20, 1930. They learned that the local government would not allow the postage fee to remain the same. The delegation then explained in detail that the Chinese postal service was not yet sufficiently developed and could not replace the private postal bureaus in delivering money and letters in inland villages and towns. Therefore, private postal bureaus are currently the only affordable and convenient method for communication and money transfer for the working-class overseas Chinese community. The Acting Governor told the delegation that the local government's abolition of private postal bureaus,</p>
<p>was based on the request of the Chinese postal authorities. (5) On February 1, 1930, Report No. 277, carried by the local newspapers, reported that the postage fee for general packages would be one cent and two cents per letter, to be implemented after March 31, 1930. According to the report, in addition to the fee increase, the government has agreed to retain the private postal bureaus, which means that the local government has realized that there is no better method to replace private postal bureaus, so the existence of private postal bureaus at present is indispensable. (6) On February 25, 1930,</p>
<p>Sixty-three public organizations and associations in this locality held a joint meeting again at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. We were elected as committee members to petition Your Excellency to extend the order to increase the postage fee for general packages by four months from March 31, 1930. (7) The purpose of requesting an extension is to allow us sufficient time to send representatives to petition our National Government,</p>
<p>as we know that the current Chinese postal service cannot replace the private postal bureaus in delivering money and letters. We believe that the Chinese government has ordered the retention of private postal bureaus, and we have explained the difficulties to the British government,</p>
<p>and stated that the proposal to abolish private postal bureaus originated from the British government. We believe that the communications between the local government and the Chinese government must be the result of some misunderstanding. (8) If we can obtain a direct</p>
<p>statement from the Chinese government that private postal bureaus cannot be abolished at present, we believe that the local government will not forcibly increase the postage fee. We believe that as long as private postal bureaus exist, there is no sufficient reason to increase the postage fee during the period when they are obligated to perform the delivery duties on behalf of the postal service. We have stated that the general package method involves thousands of letters in one package. Now, the post office wants to forcibly increase the postage fee for each letter in the general package. Isn't this forcing the working-class overseas Chinese community to pay the same fee for distributing thousands of letters and collecting thousands of return letters as for simply delivering one general package? We believe that the government's treatment of the working-class community is extremely unfair. (9) We know that the remittance rate charged by private postal bureaus is often higher than the market rate. If the post office can remit a few dollars at the market rate, the increase in postage fee would not be a problem, as the lower remittance rate would compensate for the loss. Now, the post office is increasing the postage fee without undertaking the delivery duties, and making the working-class overseas Chinese, who send two or three dollars per month, pay one cent and two cents to the local post office, as well as the return letter fee to the Chinese post office, and also suffer the loss from the remittance rate charged by private postal bureaus. We dare say that the total amount of these expenses is unbearable for the impoverished working-class community. We respectfully request Your Excellency to extend the order to increase the postage fee for general packages by four months. We await your decision.</p>
<p>Singapore Organizations Petitioning for Reduction of Private Postal Fees, Delegation. March 4th, Year 19 of the Republic.</p>
<p>Telephone Service in the Concessions</p>
<h3>Contents of the Special Operating Conditions</h3>
<p>Revised Prices Must Be Agreed Upon</p>
<p>A Central Exchange to Be Established in the French Concession</p>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Daily, the special operating conditions for telephone service in the concessions were agreed upon by the Public Works Department and the Council of the French Concession last week and sent to the China and Foreign Telephone Company on Saturday. They have now been distributed to the Telephone Advisory Committee and various companies interested in acquiring the company for consideration. The special operating term is set for forty years in the first phase, starting from April 1st of this year, followed by a ten-year term thereafter. However, a notice must be given two years in advance for mutual consultation. The same applies if the municipal authorities want to acquire the company.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy aspect of the new conditions is the cancellation of Article 15 of the old conditions regarding the use of stock premium income for public reserve funds, which is replaced by a public utility tax. It stipulates that the telephone fee for municipal authorities be reduced by 20% for the first five years. From the sixth to the tenth year, the aforementioned discount is canceled, and the company will contribute 2.5% of the total revenue from users in both concessions</p>
<p>to the municipal authorities according to the revenue ratio of each concession. From the eleventh year onwards, the contribution should be increased to 5%. Regarding telephone fees, it is stipulated that the current prices will be maintained until the full implementation of automatic telephones. If prices are revised in the future, it should be agreed upon by both the company and the municipal authorities, and the pricing standard should be based on obtaining a certain percentage of net profit on the total invested capital. If the annual net profit exceeds the specified percentage, half of the excess will go to the company and half will be allocated to a provisional account for revised prices. If the net profit in a certain year is less than the specified percentage due to reasons beyond human control, funds will be allocated from the account to make up the difference. Each time prices are revised, the balance of this account should be used as a standard for increase or decrease. The current practice of reducing telephone fees by 20% for shareholders with four or more shares has also been canceled. It is also stipulated that a central exchange should be established in the French Concession by the end of March 1934, and more should be added as appropriate, so that the French Concession has an independent telephone network with first-class service and good connections with the Public Concession and Nanshi. There is also a limit to the number of telephone lines installed in the sky on the roads.

<p>The "Tunan" Vehicle Disappears. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Tunan" ship was ordered to sail to Yingkou. As the items on board had not yet been unloaded and the ship was waiting for a certain cargo shipment to Beijing, it had been in Yingkou for many days. Yesterday, the company received an urgent telegram from Yingkou stating that the marine engineer of the "Tunan" ship, A. P. Cranston, had suddenly disappeared. A thorough search was conducted, but he was nowhere to be found. All of his personal belongings on the ship had been taken away. His whereabouts were unknown. After receiving the telegram, the company immediately inquired with Mr. Warren, the Western chief of the engine department, asking if he had received a telegram from Mr. Cranston beforehand. According to Mr. Warren, he had not received any telegrams from Mr. Cranston after the "Tunan" arrived in Yingkou. The Shanghai office has replied to Mr. Huang Hongqian, the shipowner of the "Tunan," ordering him to quickly inquire about Mr. Cranston's whereabouts. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Yingkou branch manager, instructing him to assist the "Tunan" in searching for the engineer's whereabouts in the vicinity. According to reports, Mr. Cranston is a British national who has worked as a crew member for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for 25 years and has been the chief engineer (i.e., marine engineer) of the "Tunan" for 17 years. His current monthly salary is 536 yuan. He has no mental illness. The Shanghai office believes that Mr. Cranston's disappearance is likely due to him leaving the ship on his own and is definitely not a life-threatening disappearance.</p>
<p>"Jiang'an" Collides with "Chutai". The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiang'an" ship, which came to Shanghai from Hankou, collided with a pontoon at Zhenjiang at 12:00 midnight on the 7th. At that time, the wind was strong and the water was turbulent. The naval warship "Chutai" was also moored outside the pontoon. As the "Jiang'an" ship was docking, it was impacted by the wind and waves, causing the ship to collide with the stern of the "Chutai," breaking the "Chutai's" stern mast.</p>
<p>The lights and cables on the stern were also damaged, and the hull sustained minor damage. After the "Jiang'an" ship returned to Shanghai yesterday, the mast was first removed to compensate "Chutai." Mr. Huang was also sent to Zhenjiang to inspect the damage to "Chutai" and arrange for repairs.</p>
<p>"Huayang" Worker Injured in Fall. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Huayang" ship was unloading cargo at the Jinliyuan Wharf yesterday. After clearing the hold, a dockworker wanted to retrieve goods from the bottom of the hold. Accidentally, he fell from the deck into the bottom of the hold. The dockworker was seriously injured. The water police sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that his life is in danger.</p>

<h3>Proposal to Eliminate Odd-Numbered Weights and Sampling Practices in the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association, Silk Guild,</p>
<p>The following is the document issued on the 9th, as the association has resolved to regulate odd-numbered weights, eliminate the habit of wiping away fractions, and address the issue of foreign firms drawing excessive silk samples. It was sent to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau and the Foreign Silk Exporters' Association, requesting them to impartially correct these practices and inform all foreign firms to strictly comply. The original text of the two letters is recorded below.</p>
<p>Letter to the Commodity Inspection Bureau, Respectfully submitted, On the 5th of this month, Bao Tai and twelve other silk factories proposed to regulate the minimum unit of odd-numbered weights to maintain their interests. In the past, foreign firms would arbitrarily wipe out four or five tenths of a pound when weighing silk from factories, leading to disputes. Now that the Inspection Bureau is implementing public weighing, there is no need for foreign firms to weigh the silk. The Inspection Bureau should convert the public weight of pounds into catties to prevent foreign firms from arbitrarily wiping out fractions,</p>
<p>and to avoid the factories' past hidden losses. According to Japanese practice, fractions are wiped out in units of two and a half tenths. When calculating the portions, the Inspection Bureau should</p>
<p>convert the pounds into catties and notify the foreign firms, which will directly avoid unnecessary disputes and indirectly protect the interests of the factories. We request that you publicly decide on a method, etc. After public discussion, it was agreed that the proposal was indeed insightful and that fair trade should not be biased in any way. How can the public weight be arbitrarily wiped out? If this malpractice is not eliminated,</p>
<p>it will only lead to more disputes and excessive exploitation of the interests of silk merchants. The Bureau should take charge and approve the annotation of the pound and catty figures on the inspection certificate in the future, and notify all foreign firms that all habits of wiping out fractions</p>
<p>should follow the Japanese precedent, using four taels as a unit (i.e., two and a half tenths). Do not arbitrarily deduct them to resolve disputes and maintain fairness. In addition to the public resolution, this letter is hereby submitted to the Bureau, requesting that you investigate and handle the matter, and notify the buying foreign firms to comply. Please reply for our information.</p>
<p>Letter to the Foreign Silk Exporters' Association, Respectfully submitted, According to reports from our colleagues after the implementation of public weighing and inspection, the exporters have not implemented the seller's clauses agreed upon in your Association's letter of March 19th. After public discussion on April 5th,</p>
<p>the following resolutions were made: (A) Use canvas bags and immediately abolish all oil paper white lists. Each factory has the right to freely reform this. Exporters should no longer ask the seller to provide these abolished products or their value. Sellers already bear 23 taels and 3 mace for the packaging fee for every ten pieces of silk, so they should not make exceptions and demand them. If you believe that the previous oil paper white lists are necessary for the seller to supply, please provide a detailed breakdown of the packaging expenses. (B) Sample silks should be drawn according to the previous resolution, two strands for every five pieces. (C) The drawn strands should be given a receipt by the exporters, stating the number of strands and weight. When the strands are returned,</p>
<p>they should still be weighed and counted. (Weicheng Company was the first to implement this.</p>
<p>Recently, Junsheng, Fuxiang, Sheng and other factories delivered silk to Weicheng.</p>
<p>Weicheng signed a receipt for the drawn samples, stating the number of strands and weight). (D) For silk packages shipped on Saturdays, the silk payment should be made before noon on that day. (E) Please return all excessively taken samples of silk from April 1st. All of the above clauses are matters discussed in previous meetings. At the beginning of the reform, they have not been thoroughly implemented. Please impartially correct these practices and immediately investigate and implement them to prevent unexpected disputes. Please reply for our information.</p>
<h3>Recent Disaster Situation in Henan and Shaanxi Provinces</h3>
<p>Henan Disaster Victims Sitting and Waiting for Death</p>
<p>Shaanxi Disaster Victims Killing and Eating People</p>
<p>The unprecedented disaster in the Northwest, with its terrible situation and vast affected area, is truly unprecedented in history. The Relief Bureau has recently received urgent telegrams from Henan and Shaanxi provinces regarding the latest disaster situation, which are unbearable to read. Excerpts from the original telegrams are as follows: (A) Telegrams from the Henan Relief Bureau: (First Telegram) The disaster situation in Henan is intensifying.</p>
<p>In the western counties of Henan, hundreds of people are dying every day. In Shaanxi, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, and Kaifeng, over 50,000 people have already been taken in, and those being sent across the river for resettlement are still continuously arriving. Our bureau's relief funds are exhausted, and there is no way to raise more. Not to mention the starving people in the disaster areas who are waiting for death, even the 50,000 people we have taken in are on the verge of running out of food. Once they are dispersed, not only will transportation be disrupted, but there will also be no funds to send them away. It is estimated that there will be new wheat to eat in two months, but it will cost two yuan per person per month, about 200,000 yuan, to keep these 50,000 people alive. Although there are military operations now, they do not hinder the progress of relief. We earnestly request all groups to quickly provide assistance, in accordance with the principle of saving people thoroughly. (The rest is omitted.) (Second Telegram) Following the previous telegram, Henan Province is unfortunately caught in the war zone again. Transportation is blocked, and the lifeline is cut off. Shaanxi, Luoyang, Bianliang,</p>
<p>Zhengzhou, Qin, Bo, Meng, Xin, have taken in approximately 100,000 disaster victims, providing food based on headcount. There are no relief funds at all, and no resources to send them away. Sending them to the Wu River area would mean missing the planting season, and there are no seeds. Even if they are sent back, they will only end up filling ditches. If we do not quickly seek relief and maintain the current situation, I fear that the disaster victims will be completely wiped out. We earnestly request your utmost efforts to appeal and provide assistance quickly. (The rest is omitted.) (B) Telegrams from Shaanxi: (First Telegram) (The beginning is omitted.) I heard from the elderly that during the drought of the 26th year of Guangxu, there were frequent incidents of people eating people.</p>
<p>At first, I thought it was an exaggeration and not credible. Unexpectedly, this year, in the areas severely affected by the disaster, starving people often fill their stomachs with the buttocks and feet of dead people. It is a common sight and not considered strange. Recently, in the Zhongnan Mountains, there was a case of disaster victims eating people. There was a scrivener named Zhang, nicknamed Fatty Zhang, in Zhengxing County. Due to years of drought and famine, his business declined, so he started selling eyeglasses and went to Zhen'an County to trade. He was ambushed and killed by starving people in the Zhongnan Mountains, who divided and ate his flesh. It was extremely cruel. In recent years, countless tragedies have occurred in Shaanxi due to the disaster. (The rest is omitted.) (Second Telegram) (The beginning is omitted.) After three years of severe drought, in areas less affected by the disaster, 60-70% of the fields are barren. In areas severely affected by the disaster, all the fields are barren.</p>
<p>Now that spring is warm and the snow has melted, it is the time for sowing. This month, the Relief Society resolved to</p>
<p>issue a notice to all counties to investigate the barren land left uncultivated due to disaster-related flight, and to assign the responsibility of cultivating it to their clansmen, relatives, village chiefs, etc. Thirteen detailed rules for cultivating barren land were also established for compliance. However, most of the people in the counties have fled, and those who remain do not have the strength to buy plows, cattle, and seeds. Without substantial relief funds for assistance,</p>
<p>there is still no solution. We earnestly request that you find a way to provide relief. (The rest is omitted.) Looking at the above telegrams, the disaster situation in each province is urgent, and the need for relief is as urgent as a fire. We still hope that enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life will generously donate, regardless of the amount, and send it to the Renji Hall on Six Horse Road for receipt and collection, to be sent to the disaster areas. Saving these survivors is better than building a seven-story pagoda, as the saying goes.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Association Discusses Allocating Cars to Transport Relief to Shaanxi</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association recently received a joint telegram from Mr. Zhu Ziqiao and Mr. Zhou Jingfu, stating that the disaster situation in Qinzhong (Shaanxi) is worsening daily, with starving people lying everywhere. The spring planting season is approaching urgently, and seeds are urgently needed. However, due to road blockages and difficult transportation, there is no way to provide assistance. It has now been agreed with the Shaanxi provincial authorities to allocate a train to travel between Fengtai and Shanzhou (Shaanxi) to transport relief seeds. The telegram also requested that all charitable organizations provide assistance quickly. The association immediately telegraphed Mr. She Guisheng and Mr. Zhu Zila, the directors of the Tianjin Relief Office, to inquire about the nature of the allocated trains. If they can indeed transport grain, Mr. Zhang Xianqing from the association will bring many relief workers to Beiping (Beijing) next week to go to Shaanxi and find ways to transport seeds for relief. The disaster in Shaanxi is extremely severe. If the association can transport relief supplies by train during this urgent spring planting season, please have Mr. Zhang Xianqing go there to assess the situation and do his best to help alleviate this extraordinary disaster, even if it is only a small amount.</p>
<h3>The Course of the Strike in Jiangqiao Town, West of Shanghai</h3>
<p>The stores in Jiangqiao Town, west of Shanghai, went on strike the day before yesterday. It is reported that the cause was that at around 5 pm the day before yesterday, a soldier from the water patrol team stationed in the town, dressed in plain clothes and carrying a weapon, went out to investigate a case. He was spotted by a member of the security guard, who reported it to the headquarters. The headquarters immediately summoned more than 20 members, who all armed themselves and went out on patrol to prevent accidents. At the time, Li Dekui, the patrol chief of the Third Police Station of the Jiangqiao Town Branch of the First Precinct of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, was also patrolling the area with several police officers. They encountered the armed security guard and asked why they were patrolling with weapons. A slight conflict arose during the conversation. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard from the side. However, it was not clear who fired the shot. The plainclothes soldier from the water patrol team also disappeared. The police station believed that the security guard fired the shot and accused them of firing randomly, which intensified the conflict between the two sides. As a result, a member of the security guard, Mr. Qian, was taken to the town police station by the police for investigation of the gunshot. Yesterday morning, all the stores in the town went on strike because the police station did not investigate the identity of the plainclothes soldier but instead detained the security guard. Duan Wengong, the chief of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, and Wang Xixiang, the chief of the First Precinct of the Sixth District, heard the news and</p>
<p>immediately went to the town to inquire about the incident and summoned the town's merchants for earnest persuasion.</p>
<p>Therefore, all the stores resumed business as usual the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Expansion of the World Moral Society</h3>
<p>The World Moral Society at No. 90 Jing'an Temple Road established the Moral Hospital last month. Recently, the board of directors of the society decided to add a school to cultivate children's education and develop outstanding talents as the purpose. However, the society's existing premises are narrow and crowded, and the hospital is also busy with medical affairs. Therefore, it is necessary to move to a new location to expand the society's premises. It is heard that the general affairs office of the society has found suitable houses near the Aivenyi Road (Avenue Edward VII) police station. The buildings are tall and spacious, and the expansion is extraordinary. Once the chairman of the society, Mr. Xu Yabo, returns to Shanghai, the relocation will be officially carried out. In the future, the general office of the society and the hospital and school departments will all be located in the society's premises to serve the community at the same time.</p>

<p>At 7:15 yesterday morning, a robbery suddenly occurred at No. 1 Jingchunfang, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei.</p>
<p>The Second Precinct of the Fifth District and the Baoshan Road Fifth District Headquarters nearby simultaneously heard the alarm. The chiefs of each precinct led all the police officers to rush to surround and capture the thieves. Both sides fired dozens of shots, as if facing a major enemy. As a result, two thieves were wounded and captured. Three police officers were injured on the spot, and stray bullets wounded two women. Fortunately, none of the injuries were fatal. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Using a Question of Surname as a Pretense, Han Rongsheng, a local, used to work at the Asia Petroleum Company. He lived at No. 1 Jingchunfang, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, and had some savings, which attracted the attention of the robbers. At 7:15 yesterday morning, Han was out of bed, and the maid and other servants</p>
<p>were tidying up things in the kitchen downstairs. Suddenly, someone knocked loudly on the back door and asked loudly if Mr. Han was at home. The maid and others heard someone asking for the master and suspected it was an acquaintance, so they did not doubt it. They immediately opened the door slightly, and four people filed in. The maid shouted loudly to the master that there were guests. Han heard the sound and hurried downstairs. He looked closely at the four people and did not recognize any of them. Just as he was about to ask what was going on, the robbers had already pulled out their guns and forbade him to make a sound.</p>
<p>The Housewife Was Alert, Han Saw Uninvited Guests Showing Guns,</p>
<p>Knowing He Had Encountered Robbers, Han Pretended to Be Calm at the Time and Pretended to Ask the Robbers,</p>
<p>What They Wanted. The Robbers Said to Each Other, "Brothers Are in Trouble, Please Help Us." Han Agreed Generously and Led the Robbers Upstairs. The Robbers Searched the Upstairs and Took the Loot to Another Room. They Saw Many Suitcases and Ordered Han to Take the Keys to Open the Suitcases. Han Just Agreed and Turned Around</p>
<p>, Stepped Out of the Room, Suddenly Heard Someone Knocking Loudly on the Door. The Robbers Fled in Panic. It Turned Out That When the Robbers Entered the House, Han's Wife Had Heard the Alarm Upstairs. She Immediately Sneaked to the Drying Platform, Crossed the Neighbor's House, and Hurried to the Nearby Qiujiang Bridge Police Kiosk to Report the Crime. Then the Police Kiosk Telegraphed the Fifth District Headquarters. Chief You Heard the News and Immediately Led All the Police Officers, Fully Armed, to Surround and Capture the Thieves in Different Directions. The One Who Knocked Loudly on the Door at the Time Was the Thief Who Was Standing Guard at the Door.</p>
<p>Opening Fire to Resist Arrest, the Robbers Escaped from Jingchunfang, Crossed Hexingli to Qiujiang Road, and Then Turned into Yipinli. They Met Patrol Chief Gu Wentao of the Fifth District, Who Was Leading the Police to Rush to Meet Them. The Robber Immediately Opened Fire to Resist Arrest. Patrol Chief Gu Also Drew His Gun and Fired Back. Both Sides Fired More Than Ten Shots in Total. Police Officer Huan Wanhai Gave His Life to Step Forward and Hug the Robber. The Robber Continued to Fire Several Shots. Police Officer Huan Was Hit in the Right Leg by a Bullet.</p>
<p>At the Same Time, Patrol Chief Yuan Mingzhen, Police Officers Liu Fengtian, and Liu Desheng</p>
<p>Together Stepped Forward and Captured the Robber. Liu Desheng Fell and Injured His Wrist. Police Officer Yu Xiujiang's Police Uniform Was Shot Through Two Holes, Fortunately He Was Not Injured. The Original Loot Was Searched from the Robber's Side on the Spot, Including a Pair of Pearl Flowers, Thirty-Three Yuan in Silver Dollars, a Pair of Diamond Earrings, Two Gemstone Earrings, a Pair of Gold Earrings, a Gold Button, a Diamond "Fu" Character, and Five 10,000-Ruble Notes. The Robber Was Hit by a Bullet in the Right Thigh and the Lower Part of the Left Leg.</p>
<p>Climbing Over the Wall and Being Captured, After One Robber Was Captured, Patrol Chief Gu Ordered the Robber to Be Taken to the Headquarters First, and Then Led the Police Forward to Search. Unexpectedly, When They Reached the Thirteenth Alley of Yipinli, They Met Another Robber. The Robber Saw the Police Arriving and Immediately Drew His Gun and Fired Three Shots at Patrol Chief Gu in Succession, None of Which Hit. The Robber Fired and Fled. Patrol Chief Gu Drew His Gun and Fired Back While Chasing Closely. Chasing to the House at No. 280, Fifth Family, Twelfth Alley, the Robber Climbed Over the Wall and Escaped to the Neighboring Lianzhili. Unexpectedly, Patrol Chief Niu Kaiping Had Already Led the Police to Lie in Ambush There.</p>
<p>The Robber Fired Another Shot. At the Same Time, Patrol Chief Liu Dehe, Police Officers Yu Mingliang, and Zheng Xianyu All Drew Their Guns and Fired Back. The Robber Was Hit in the Right Calf by a Bullet and Collapsed to the Ground. Yu and Zheng Stepped Forward and Arrested Him. Patrol Chief Liu Took the Robber's Gun and Took Him to the Headquarters Together. Stray Bullets Injured People, Two Robbers Were Captured One After Another and Taken to the Headquarters Together.

<h3>Small Laborer Carried to Court</h3>
<p>Circumstances of Chen Shu's Accident</p>
<p>Compensation Demanded for Deceased</p>
<p>Judge Pronounces Verdict in Court</p>
<p>Total Fine of Six Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>At approximately 5:30 PM on the 6th of this month, two laborers from Jiangbei, Xie Zhitang and Zhu Yulin, were jointly carrying a large log, about thirty feet long and six feet wide. As they were walking on Yuyuan Road in Shanghai's western district, just as they were turning into a lane, a Suzhou native, Lu Quan'gen, driving car number 4898, sped towards them. The driver was unable to avoid them in time, causing the car to collide with the log. The massive log fell, injuring both Xie and Zhu. Upon investigation, the patrolmen arrested the car driver Lu Quan'gen and detained him at the Jing'an Temple police station. The two injured men were taken to Dehe Hospital.</p>
<p>Xie's injuries were so severe that he died the next day despite medical treatment. Zhu's injuries were minor, and he remained in the hospital for treatment. The hospital notified the police station, which sent officers to transport Xie's body to the coroner's office for examination. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Lu Quan'gen to the Special District Court. Representatives of the deceased's family hired a lawyer to appear in court, stating that the deceased, Xie Zhitang, worked in a factory, earning a monthly salary of approximately thirty yuan, upon which his entire family depended for their livelihood. Now, he has tragically been crushed to death.</p>
<p>Therefore, they filed a civil suit, demanding compensation for funeral expenses, calculated over a ten-year period, totaling three thousand yuan. As for Zhu Yulin, whose injuries were minor,</p>
<p>they also requested reimbursement for medical expenses amounting to fifty yuan. Subsequently, Mr. Ru Bao from the police station provided an account of the incident. Zhu Yulin, the injured party, was carried into court and testified that he and the deceased were carrying a large log together and were turning into the lane when the defendant drove</p>
<p>at high speed, knocking him down. However, he did not see the defendant's car beforehand, nor did he hear a horn. The accident was indeed caused by the defendant's excessive speed. When questioned, the defendant claimed that he was driving through Yuyuan Road at a moderate speed.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs were carrying the log from the opposite direction. As his car approached, the plaintiffs suddenly turned the log horizontally, intending to carry it into the lane. He immediately tried to swerve to avoid them, but the log was exceptionally long,</p>
<p>blocking the entire road. Even though he steered his car to the side of the road, there was no way to avoid the accident. Subsequently, Mr. Ru, the lawyer from the police station, and Mr. Jiang Yiping, the lawyer hired by the defendant, engaged in a debate, arguing extensively about</p>
<p>the circumstances and the issue of negligence. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the testimonies, declared the debate closed, and pronounced the verdict in court. The main text read: "The defendant, Lu Quan'gen, is found guilty of causing death through negligence and is fined five hundred yuan. For the crime of causing injury through negligence,</p>
<p>he is fined two hundred yuan. The total fine is six hundred yuan. For each two days of detention before the judgment is finalized, one yuan will be deducted from the fine. If the fine is not paid through enforcement, imprisonment will be substituted at a rate of two yuan per day. The attached civil suit will be transferred to the civil court for handling."</p>
<p>Special District Court</p>
<h3>Opening of Foreign Cases</h3>
<p>First Trial Yesterday</p>
<p>Brought by British and American Firms</p>
<p>Better Order Than Before</p>
<p>New Court Displays Vigor</p>
<p>With the establishment of the Shanghai Special District Court, the system of consular jury trials that had existed for decades has come to an end. In the future, the court will hear criminal and civil cases brought by foreign nationals against Chinese citizens without the need for juries. Although the Japanese initially objected to the abolition of juries,</p>
<p>they have recently complied. President Yang of the court believes that the number of cases accepted from merchants of various countries, both old and new, is very high, and trials should be conducted in succession to avoid backlog. Each civil court judge has set trial dates and instructed officials to notify the parties concerned separately to report on schedule and await trial.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning marked the first day of the opening of foreign cases after the establishment of the court. Judge Ying Shi, Head of the Civil Court, Judge Zhou Daren,</p>
<p>and Judges Pang Shurong and Luo Chongtai of the Summary Court each opened the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth courts respectively, to hear several cases brought by British and American firms to recover loans. Consuls from Britain, America, and other countries all complied with the newly signed agreements and abandoned jury trials. The lawyers for the plaintiffs in each case were all foreign nationals, who brought interpreters to the court to translate. The presiding judge experienced no communication barrier. The order was better than when there were consular juries in the past. Because the judge alone conducted the interrogation, without interference from others, no unnecessary incidents occurred. And since there were no disputes, the conclusion of a case was not delayed. Therefore, the abolition of the consular jury system,</p>
<p>while subjectively reclaiming our country's legal rights, objectively benefits foreign nationals living in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Wusong Chamber of Commerce requests improvements to the</p>
<h3>Steam Train Facilities on the Songhu Road</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai branch road was converted to steam train traffic, passengers have praised the convenience of travel and the accuracy of the timetable. It is now known that Zheng Shushan, Chairman of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, believes that there are several aspects of the facilities of the train that must be improved. (1)</p>
<p>When the train is running, many sparks fly out of the chimney. When the wind carries them far, they can land on the houses along the road, easily causing disaster. Furthermore, the houses are densely packed along the road, and the grass houses near the Zhanghuabang Railway were recently burned down when sparks from the steam train flew out. It is essential to find a way to improve this situation to prevent further danger. (2) Adding a Gaojingmiao station between Jiangwan and Zhanghuabang would be</p>
<p>very convenient for passengers in the Yinhang area. However, the area is quite desolate, with few pedestrians, and there is concern that it may be targeted by bandits, especially at night. The railway bureau should deploy armed police to patrol the station regularly to protect passenger safety. Yesterday, the Wusong Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Director Liu of the railway bureau, requesting improvements to achieve perfection.</p>

<h3>Visits the Shanghai Waterworks Company</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Mr. Bi Yaxun, Chief Engineer and Manager of the Shanghai Waterworks Company, invited Mayor Zhang and his wife to visit the Yangshupu Waterworks Plant. They were accompanied by Mr. Huang Boqiao, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Mr. Zou Enyong, Chief Technician. They toured the various water pools, pump rooms, boiler rooms, and laboratories. Mr. Bi Yaxun, along with Mr. Li Tu, Chairman of the company, and Mr. Walter, the secretary, led the tour and provided warm hospitality. Mayor Zhang and others felt that the plant's equipment was complete, the layout was organized, and the scale was quite grand, which they greatly praised. Mr. Bi Yaxun originally intended to invite the Mayor to visit the workers' residences and schools in the northern part of the plant, but Mayor Zhang had official duties and could not stay long, so he took his leave.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Barge Damaged by British Ship</h3>
<p>The Guild is Negotiating</p>
<p>According to sources from the Siming Transport Barge and Coal Ship Guild, the Ningbo boat owner Zhong Xiaoqing's barge, captained by Chen Xiaowu, was carrying stones when, at 7:05 AM on April 2nd, it was traveling from Puxi to Pudong. As it approached the Lujiazui Water Police Station, the British firm Bảo Ho Company's Sunland vessel, being towed by a tug, was also sailing in the area. At this time, the tug suddenly gave way, causing the ship's bow to lose control and proceed directly toward the Water Police Station. The barge had no room to maneuver in the</p>
<p>tight space, and its front (left side) was struck by the massive vessel, causing significant damage. However, another vessel, Uarilc,</p>
<p>was observing behind the barge and noted minor damage. Zhong Xiaoqing reported to the Siming Transport Barge and Coal Ship Guild, requesting assistance. Bao Ho Company requested Paulsen, David &amp; Co., surveyors, to conduct an assessment and jointly discuss compensation methods with representatives from the guild. However, the company only acknowledged that the damage to the rear of the barge was caused by them, leading to a temporary impasse. It is confirmed that the nc!j!e merchant vessel was small and was indeed observing behind the barge, and the damaged boat is still present, making it easy to understand the events. However, the circumstances at the time can be proven by other vessels. It is reported that this matter is still under negotiation.</p>
<p>Municipal Government</p>
<h3>Prohibiting the Dumping of Trash in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government recently discovered garbage barges arbitrarily dumping waste in the Huangpu River, which it considers detrimental to both hygiene and the river channel. It has specifically ordered the Sanitation and Public Safety Bureaus to strictly prohibit this and to implement the various measures for escorting garbage ships adopted by the bureau's meetings.</p>
<h3>Assassin of Opera Singer Arrested</h3>
<p>Xiao Yuehua, a Yangzhou opera singer at the Qingsheng Theater on Route Aoulléga, was assassinated in early December of the previous year, as previously reported. Although the military and police authorities have continued to investigate the case, the assassin has remained at large. However, on the night before last, detectives Xin Jingsheng, Chen Guangxiang, Xu Haishan, and Lu Tingshu from the Fifth District of Zhabei received a tip that the assassin, Zhang Yucai (also known as Dalianzi),</p>
<p>was watching a play at the Dingxin Stage near Hujia Wood Bridge. The detectives, carrying concealed weapons, proceeded to the location and arrested Zhang on the spot. He was taken to the station and questioned, but Zhang refused to confess. Yesterday, a document was prepared and submitted to the Judicial Section for punishment.</p>
<h3>Tragic Death from Falling Down Stairs</h3>
<p>Xu Yongjin, a Suzhou native, 33 years old, residing at No. 58 Songhe Lane, Route Vilmont, French Concession, worked as a tea server in a theater.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, after getting up and washing his face, he went upstairs and, for unknown reasons, suddenly fell on the stairs and rolled down, cracking his skull and dying instantly. His family reported to the police, who ordered detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuantang Verification Office to await an autopsy.</p>
<p>Maid Dies of Poisoning</p>
<h3>Master Charged with Neglect</h3>
<p>Delayed Sending to Hospital for Five Hours</p>
<p>Anhui elder Wang Xunzu, represented by a lawyer, filed a lawsuit at the French Court, claiming that his daughter-in-law, Wang Wangshi, was working as a maid at Wang Senchang's lumber yard when she was abused by Wang and his wife, leading to her death by poisoning. The case was heard again yesterday. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that there was a five-hour delay between the time the deceased took the poison and when the police were notified and she was sent to the hospital. The deceased was suffering from an acute condition. How could there be such a delay? This shows that the defendant had malicious intentions.</p>
<p>Moreover, after her death, the defendant did not contribute to her funeral expenses, which were covered by a charitable organization. The defendant showed no compassion. Such cruelty is evident. He requested an investigation and compensation for bereavement, etc. When questioned, Wang Senchang stated that the deceased had been working as a maid in his business for just seventeen days.</p>
<p>She often cried privately. When asked, she revealed that her husband had been sentenced to seven years in the Caohejing Prison for committing a crime. Her suicide was likely due to her resentment of her fate. However, he had treated her very well and there was no abuse. Please investigate. Judge Zhu Cheng stated that the case was important.</p>
<p>Further investigation would be conducted. A new date would be set for review.</p>

<h3>Reactionary Element Chen Moke Apprehended</h3>
<p>Hua Guo, a Chinese detective from the General Police Station, lived at No. 475 Mctaggart Hurst Road, Xuhui. Recently, Chen Moke (also known as Chen Zhonghao and Chen Bi Kuang), from Anhui, moved into the pavilion room of his house. The detective noticed that he was behaving suspiciously. After secretly investigating for several days, he learned that Chen was a reactionary element. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 1:10 PM, he reported to Detective Evans, the West Detective Chief of the Political Department, and with the assistance of Detective Gu Weiqing and the local Gordon Road Police Station detective Gao Zhen, went to the address and arrested Chen. Reactionary leaflets and books, as well as shredded leaflets, were found under the bed and on the desk. All were taken to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, he was transferred to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court.</p>
<p>Judge Song Yuan, along with Judges Du Fuyue and Ye Zaichou, and Chief Prosecutor Wang Zhennan, heard the case. Mr. Ru Bao, the police lawyer, stated the case and presented the various reactionary publications seized. Detectives Ding and Gao then reported the circumstances of the arrest.

These publications were brought by Mr. Li Junda on the evening of the 6th of this month to be temporarily stored.</p>
<p>There were two packages, large and small. He said he would pick them up the next day, but Mr. Li disappeared without a trace. He did not know that they contained reactionary documents. Judge Song reviewed the testimony and ordered Chen to be detained for another hearing on the morning of the 12th of this month.</p>
<h3>Mother's Brother's Heinous Act</h3>
<p>Trying to Sell Niece as a Prostitute</p>
<p>Dai A'ren, a woman from Jiaxing, 18 years old, lost both parents at a young age and lived with her stepmother. Last month, she was brought to Shanghai by her maternal uncle, Fang Zhicai, under the pretext of helping with household chores. He asked Yang Desheng to introduce her to Cao Wangshi, a woman from Yangzhou in the French Concession, as a prostitute. The asking price was 240 yuan, but the transaction had not been completed. Detective Ding Wensheng of the French Concession Police learned of this and arrested all the people involved. Yesterday, they were sent to the French Court for investigation. The police chief reported the details, stating that the defendant was found to be enticing a virtuous woman into prostitution, which constituted crimes under Articles 247, 257, and</p>
<p>358 of the criminal law. He requested a severe investigation. When questioned, Fang Zhicai,</p>
<p>admitted that he had indeed brought his niece to Shanghai to sell her into prostitution. Yang Desheng confessed that he knew Fang Zhicai and that Fang had asked him to introduce his niece to Mrs. Wang as a prostitute. When the woman, Dai A'ren, was questioned, she stated that her parents had died early and she was living with her stepmother in her hometown. This time, her uncle brought her to Shanghai, falsely claiming that he was taking her to Mrs. Wang's house to help with household chores, but he forced her to become a prostitute. However, she did not want to pursue this low profession. She requested to be released. Cao Wangshi stated that Dai A'ren had been brought by Yang Desheng for prostitution. The Chinese and foreign judges sentenced Fang Zhicai to six months in the Western Jail, and Yang Desheng and Cao Wangshi to four months each as a warning. Dai was sent to an institution to find a suitable match.</p>

<p>a roll of green thick tribute wool, a roll of black thick tribute wool, a piece of waterfall city cloth (50 bolts in total), four pieces of Da Xi silk, a piece of 克羅紗, and a piece of satinet. After loading was completed at about 8 PM, they rowed from Hongkou to the Longmao pier in Pudong to unload. When passing the surface of the river near the mouth of the Suzhou River, a double-oared boat suddenly approached the boat. Docking alongside, eight robbers with handguns jumped over the boat, first tying up the crew, including the helmsman, and throwing them into the rear hold. Then, they completely transferred the cargo to the rowing boat and escaped without a trace. After the cargo boat was robbed, the thieves rowed it to a berth near the Xin Zha Jiangyuan Alley in the Suzhou River, and the helmsman and crew were confined in the hold, unable to escape. Until 4 AM yesterday morning, the three customs brokers found that the boat and cargo were missing and sent people to search in all directions, and finally found the boat at the location and released the helmsman, etc., and found that all the cargo had been stolen,</p>
<p>resulting in great loss. They reported to the respective firms, and in the morning, they declared the losses and sent people to report to the Water Police Station for investigation. The police chief, upon receiving the report,</p>
<p>said that the robbers dared to commit robbery with weapons on the river surface, which seriously hindered water transportation. He specifically ordered all detectives and police to step up their pursuit,</p>
<p>and to arrest all the criminals and bring them to justice to quell the banditry.</p>
<h3>Kiln Collapse Crushes Boatman</h3>
<p>Ge Xiaofenzi, a Bloody Mess, Was Usually Engaged in Transporting Goods by Boat on the Suzhou River at Zhoujia Bridge, Xuhui. Ge Zhouyu, 50 years old, from Yancheng, had only one son named Ge Xiaofenzi, who was fifteen years old and cared for the boat with his father. He was very diligent and thrifty and was very loved by his father. At about 7 PM the day before yesterday, Ge's boat was carrying a load of 三合土 and sailed to the lime kiln area of Xiaoshadu to dock. Ge and his son went ashore to the kiln set up by Wu Zhao to load. However, the kiln had been damaged for many years. Not long after loading began, there was a sudden "bang" sound, and the high walls of the kiln collapsed. Ge's son, Xiaofenzi, was unable to escape and was buried in the dirt. Ge and others in the kiln immediately tried to rescue him, but he had suffered severe injuries, was a bloody mess, and had already died. Ge Zhouyu reported this to the local Sixth District Police Station. The police were immediately dispatched to the scene and summoned the kiln owner Wu Zhao and manager Wang Shaoqing for questioning. After separate interrogations by District Chief Duan, according to the plaintiff Ge Zhouyu, he was 50 years old, from Yancheng, and he requested an allowance because he only had one son. Wu Zhao claimed that he was 16 years old, from Yancheng, and that the kiln was set up by his older brother. Wang Shaoqing stated that he was 40 years old, from Ningbo,</p>
<p>and had been working as the manager of the kiln. After receiving the statements, District Chief Duan immediately ordered the police to summon Wu Zhao's brother. Today, a document will be prepared and submitted to the local court for investigation. Subsequently, the local保甲 Zhang Xietang reported to the local court, requesting to send personnel to verify the situation. Later, at about 4 PM, the court appointed Prosecutor Li Gongchen and Secretary Deng Zhenwei to bring with them to verify the scene. It was found that the boy had been crushed to death before his death due to severe injuries. He ordered the father of the corpse, Ge Zhouyu, to prepare a coffin first and then continue the investigation.</p>
<h3>Disappearance of Miss Tang</h3>
<p>Believed to Be Abducted by Xu Yangchun</p>
<p>Tang Libang, 48 years old, from Yancheng, residing at No. 109 Xitan, Xiaoshadu, Xuhui, runs a private school at home, teaching children for a living. He has a daughter named Guannan, eighteen years old, who is unmarried. She works at the Robison Road Xihe Yarn Factory, going in the morning and returning in the evening. Unexpectedly, on the 28th of last month, his daughter suddenly disappeared. Tang searched everywhere, but without success. Until recently, a fellow villager, Ge Xinglin, reported to Tang that earlier this month, he had seen Xu Yangchun from Baoying walking on the road with the daughter. Because he knew that Xu worked in the same factory as the daughter, he did not suspect anything else. Now that the daughter has been abducted and is missing, it must be that Xu has abducted her. Therefore, Tang, accompanied by witness Ge Xinglin, went to the Xiaoshadu Lime Kiln the other day and arrested Xu Yangchun, reporting to the Sixth District Police Station. After separate interrogations by District Chief Duan, because the case involved abduction, the case was submitted to the court for investigation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Robberies Noted</h3>
<p>Shandong Road. At 7:50 PM last night, three robbers broke into No. 397 Shandong Road, Public Concession, two of whom had handguns. They ordered the occupants not to make a sound and robbed them of 110 yuan in silver dollars. The robbers then burst out of the door. The victim has reported to the Fourth Horse Road General Police Station for investigation.</p>
<p>Guangdong Road. At 9:30 PM last night, a man, Mr. Jia, was walking in an alley on Guangdong Road when suddenly four thugs emerged from the darkness. They had no weapons, blocked his way, grabbed him, threw him to the ground, and robbed him of 25 yuan in silver dollars and a paper bill worth 450 taels. The robbers then fled in different directions.</p>
<h3>Police Station Seeks Owners of Stolen Bicycles</h3>
<p>The Hongkou Police Station has confiscated five bicycles from thieves. If the owners want to claim them, they can go to the Hongkou Police Station.</p>

<h3>Lament for the Fallen Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhian</p>
<p>Mourning the Soldiers Who Died Defending the Northeast Border</p>
<p>Smoke and dust rise on the Heilong River. Urgent dispatches travel thousands of miles in a single night. There is no day to settle the Central Plains. Someone borrows chopsticks to plan the northern frontier. The northern frontier is isolated, guarded by soldiers. For a time, passion stirred the winds and clouds. How could there be any hardship in being a soldier?</p>
<p>On the borderlands, everlasting are the merits of resisting the invaders. Deep trenches and high ramparts were arranged early. In their eyes, they only hated that there were too few who shared their hatred. The brave troops were first marked at Luoyan City; news of victories has already spread to Lianyun Fortress. A separate force comes on the water. The sound of the river is even more mournful than the sound of the horns. Still relying on a torch within the gourd, not letting the iron locks of the Yellow River be opened. The powerful enemy will not look with ordinary eyes.</p>
<p>Charging like boars, fleeing like wolves, they come and go. Startled by shadows, the white geese fly. Who remembers the Yellow Dragon garrisons, wounded? The invaders come again on the Yiluo River. How to wait when strength is exhausted and aid is cut off? Who knows that after measuring sand in the middle of the night, they still sing the ancient "Chil Le Song"? It is a man's duty to give up life for righteousness. Holding their beards, they will not betray their lifelong ambitions.</p>
<p>How desolate, after death, is the light yellow uniform. How generous, within their hearts, are the dried ink words. I sigh that there was a Han in the army (referring to Brigade Commander Han Guangdi), leaving only old fortifications for people to see. Who knows where Xian Zhen is now? Only Wang Lin's blood remains, not yet cold. In Liaoyang in the third month, the clouds are still frozen. Who, after the pain subsides, still thinks of the pain?</p>
<p>The cold moon summons the souls of the patriots. The mournful wind blows apart the dreams of women in their spring boudoirs. They sacrificed their seven-foot bodies for the country. No need to resent the crows and kites that peck at their flesh. Let us take a spoonful of yellow-sealed wine and toast from afar to the ancient green-bricked tomb.</p>
<h3>Food Statistics from the National Games</h3>
<p>— Yan Xichen</p>
<p>This National Games not only caused a sensation throughout the country,</p>
<p>but also attracted the attention of foreigners. Therefore, there were many foreigners who came from afar to attend and observe. For example, the Osaka News Agency and the Daily News Agency of Japan sent reporters to Hangzhou one day before the opening to participate in the Games and conduct interviews. The results of each event have been detailed in various newspapers. Even the anecdotes of the Games have been published as much as possible in various newspapers. However, the food consumption of the Games seems to have not yet been mentioned. This is also quite interesting. The results of the survey from the Games' kitchen are recorded below.</p>
<p>During the first, second, and third days after the opening of the Games, a total of 300 tables were needed per meal for athletes and referees, and about 100 tables for other staff. Now that some delegations have returned home, the number of tables has also decreased slightly. The following lists the items of food that were consumed more each day.</p>
<p>Item Name	Daily Consumption Amount	Item Name	Daily Consumption Amount</p>
<p>Rice	Around 14 shi	Meat	300 jin</p>
<p>Eggs	5,000	Fish	600 jin</p>
<p>Vegetables	800 jin	Steamed Buns	10,000</p>
<p>Pickled Vegetables	500 jin	Tofu Sheets	2,000 sheets</p>
<p>Mao Bamboo Shoots	500 jin	Tofu	30 boards</p>
<p>Spring Bamboo Shoots	500 jin	Fried Tofu Puffs	10,000</p>
<p>Peanuts	100 jin	Dried Tofu	7,000 pieces</p>
<p>Pickled Cucumber	90 jin	Southern Goods	60 yuan</p>
<p>Soy Sauce	200 jin	Vegetable Oil	100 jin</p>
<h3>Continued Biography of Physical Educationist Wei Xudong</h3>
<p>— Xu Fan</p>
<p>The facts about the physical educationist Wei Xudong mentioned in the previous article are very accurate.</p>
<p>However, I studied in Wumen in my early years, and I listened to Mr. Wei's teachings for several years. Therefore, I know his history in more detail. I will continue to record one or two things as a commemoration.</p>
<p>Mr. Wei's given name was Tinghui, and Xudong was his courtesy name. Wei Guangshou, the Viceroy of Liangjiang in the Manchu Qing Dynasty, was his ancestor. When the new army was reorganized,</p>
<p>a preparatory military academy was established in Baixia. Mr. Wei was selected from the ranks to enter.</p>
<p>After completing his studies, he was tested. He was the best in practical skills. He was at the bottom in academic subjects. In the end, because of his excellent technical skills, he was still ranked among the best. Mr. Wei was magnanimous and did not shy away from mentioning his academic weakness. Later, Lu Chunjian, the Governor of Jiangsu, appointed Mr. Wei to a physical education position at a higher school. Mr. Wei immediately equipped the school with exercise equipment such as horizontal bars, wooden horses, aerial ladders, and platforms. In addition to the daily</p>
<h3>Matchmaking Bamboo</h3>
<p>— Ji Jin</p>
<p>Matchmaking bamboo, commonly known as "Double Union Bamboo," is produced in Liaoxi Estuary, northeast of Guangzhou. Two plants are integrated as one.</p>
<p>The branches and leaves intertwine. The appearance is not very different. Saw it open and you can see two holes, shaped like the character "吕". According to the locals, in the past, a young boy and girl (their era and surnames are not verifiable) were playing by the stream. Each held one end of a green bamboo stick and threw it into the middle of the stream, declaring that if the two bamboo sticks joined together, they would become husband and wife. Looking at it, it was indeed so.</p>
<p>They returned to tell their parents, and eventually, they were engaged. Enthusiasts transplanted this bamboo to the area, and it grew luxuriantly. Therefore, the pool was named "Betrothal Pool." The pool is in Liaoxi Estuary, where matchmaking bamboo groves grow on both sides, full of charm. Now, my friend Mr. Li returned from Guangdong and gave me a branch. It is about five feet long. All the leaves have fallen off, but the base still has stems and whiskers. He said that it can be revived. I will plant it in the garden and cover it with soil. But I don't know if it has a chance to live.</p>
<p>Teaching military drills, he patiently taught apparatus exercises. He often practiced on the parade ground when the sun was setting, allowing people to watch. He was capable of feats such as lifting a tripod, spinning on the iron bar, and executing cartwheels with the energy of dozens of revolutions. He was light, agile, and as fast as an electric wheel, surprising everyone who saw him.</p>
<p>And Mr. Wei's great reputation spread far and wide.</p>
<p>At that time, there were few schools in Wumen. The education authorities did not supervise sports meets or recreational events. However, in order to promote the spirit of martial arts, Mr. Wei first organized a sports meet at the higher school. Soon, alumni from Soochow University and the Second Normal School responded and participated. Mr. Wei often took the opportunity at gatherings to promote the benefits of physical education for the human body. Because of Mr. Wei, the weak customs of Wuxia began to compete in advocating martial arts. Later, the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce was established, and Mr. Wei was also hired as the commander. At that time, Mr. Wei was also teaching at Soochow University, devoting all his energy to guiding physical education. In the last years of the Guangxu era, he was also hired as a coach by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, dividing his time between Suzhou and Shanghai, teaching on a rotating schedule. From then on, he held the reins of physical education for students and businessmen in Suzhou and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mr. Wei liked to ride horses and bicycles. When riding a horse at full speed, he would deliberately drop his hat on the ground and be able to whip his horse back, dash past the original spot, suddenly jump down, pick up the hat, and leave. When riding a bicycle, he would stand on one foot on the bike's handlebar while the wheels were spinning rapidly, or he would perform a feat of lifting a tripod, or he would jump off the ground and let the bike continue to move forward. Mr. Wei would chase after the bike, jump back on, and sit upright, pedaling. His speed was amazing. At that time, a certain coach of the 45th Regiment was also known for his skills. With the introduction of Liu Jieyu, the secretary of the regiment (that is, a farmer from Tiantai Mountain), he once competed with Mr. Wei after a sports meet. In the end, Mr. Wei won the championship. Mr. Wei was humble and approachable and also enjoyed having fun with others.</p>
<p>It is a pity that he has now passed away and we will never see Mr. Wei's skills again.</p>
<h3>Record of Cherry Blossom Viewing at Jinchang</h3>
<p>— Xiaohou</p>
<p>As a reporter, I traveled to Suzhou for the reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Newspaper Association. After arriving in Suzhou, I was accompanied by Qiu Kun, the chief editor of the Suzhou Ming Pao, and reporter Chen Shipei to visit Tianping and Tiger Hill, as well as Dengwei to see the plum blossoms. After the trip, my old friend Wu Xinshan from Jinling came to visit. I talked to him about my trip to the East last autumn and regretted not being able to see the cherry blossoms on the three islands due to the timing. He said that in Qingyang, outside the Panmen Gate of Suzhou, the cherry blossoms were now in full bloom, and what could not be obtained on the three islands of Fusang could be obtained domestically. At that time, I was packing my bags, planning to take the 5:00 PM express train to Zhenjiang. It was less than three hours before the train departed. Mr. Wu strongly urged me to go.</p>
<p>So we rode in a car together. With a whip and the setting sun, the sound of hooves pattered. We arrived at our destination in about ten minutes. Looking closely, the cherry blossoms were arranged in rows.</p>
<p>The petals resembled peaches and plums, but the color was pink, as bright as brocade, winding for about a mile. At the entrance, there was a sign that said "Stop Vehicles and Horses". Visitors must get out of their cars and walk from here. However, Japanese policemen in uniforms patrolled the cherry blossom ranks on bicycles.</p>
<p>Women in wooden sandals strolled around, leisurely and content. According to Mr. Wu, who traveled with me, this place has always been a Japanese concession. The Japanese consulate resides here, with an attached Japanese police station, which is beyond the control of our Chinese governance. Recently, I heard that because the market is deserted, there is talk of our country taking it back, imitating the British concession in Zhenjiang. I still remember last spring, when I traveled with my colleague Chen Shaojun from Jinling New Village, serving my mother on a trip to West Lake. On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, we agreed that this spring, we would go to Japan early for the Far Eastern Games to see the cherry blossoms. There was also a couplet that read: The railway dragon snakes travel across the continent,</p>
<p>Lovers from New Village travel together. Looking at the green trees and green mountains from afar, all are collected in the eyes of the spring clouds. Now, Shaojun is stimulated by the environment and stays at home with his mother, retreating and not asking about worldly affairs. I, as a reporter, am still wandering around, with no place to settle down. Recalling past events, I cannot help but feel the difference between now and then.</p>
<p>Red Rug</p>
<h3>Grand Rehearsal of the Bayi Yaji Society</h3>
<p>— Ruo</p>
<p>The Bayi Yaji Society was established on February 23rd, only a little more than a month ago. Most of the members of the society are experienced amateur opera performers, so with just a brief explanation from the teachers and a short period of practice, they can perform on stage. On the 6th of this month, the society specially rehearsed and sang at the Ningbo Tongxiang Association for one day and night as a memento. I will record what I saw during the day. The performance began at around 1 p.m. Chen Boyong performed two excerpts in a row, one being "Golden Stage," playing Tian Dan, and the other being "Chain Links," playing Huang Tianba. This man has sufficient capital and a broad voice. He handled the performance with ease. The upside-down board of "Golden Stage," singing the "ga" tune, was especially energetic. "Scolding the Palace" was not performed due to time constraints. Instead, they performed "Catching and Releasing Cao," which was quite natural in both singing and acting. As the saying goes, "It takes a long road to know a horse's strength." Because I was backstage tuning someone's voice, I didn't get to hear it. Then, "Yellow Crane Tower" took the stage, with Chen Boyong playing Liu Bei and Wei Xinsun playing Zhou Yu, each excelling in their own way. Mr. Wei sang a section of "Southern Bangzi," which was melodious and pleasant to the ear. Next was Wang Guansan and Wei Fusun's performance of "Farewell at the Kiln." Mr. Wang played Pinggui, with a moderate build. His posture in the "Qi Ba" was both neat and lively. At the beginning, he said, "Helping and protecting the Tang king establish great merit," which won him a full house of applause. Mr. Wei's Wang Baochuan had a beautiful appearance. Her acting strictly adhered to the rules. After the opening introduction, she sang a large passage of "Zheng Erhuang," with accurate notes and round tones, showing her skill. As for the performance of the emotions of a couple parting, it was also just right.</p>
<p>Whenever I watch this play being performed, it often makes my hair stand on end. The performances of these two gentlemen did not have these shortcomings, which shows the depth of their research. Mr. Wei asked me to play the role of the stringed instrument in this play. I reluctantly took on the role. Fortunately, there were no major mistakes. Following this was Zhang Yisheng's "Disturbing the Government Office." Mr. Zhang is an old amateur opera singer from Beiping, singing in the style of Uncle Yan. He is full of flavor. His posture in "Asking the Woodcutter" is skilled and refined, truly like an expert. It is not easy. The final act was Zhao Zuichiu's "Yutangchun." Mr. Zhao's appearance was exceptionally charming. In the "Xipi Slow Board" and "Original Board," almost every tune he sang was in the style of Cheng, and every sentence was new. The accompaniment of the Li brothers was also excellent. The role of Wang Gongzi in this play was played by the famous amateur opera singer Mr. Nie Shaoxuan, which added a lot of color to the performance.</p>
<h3>A New Way to See the Peach Blossoms at Longhua</h3>
<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>The peach blossoms at Longhua, like ten thousand pieces of red clouds, stretch for miles. It is truly a great sight on the sea. However, in the past, we only knew to invite friends to drive or walk there together, never knowing that there were other ways to appreciate them besides walking through the woods.</p>
<p>The author recently took the Xinminxin ship from Desheng Port to Shanghai. When passing Longhua Mouth, I saw patches of red clouds from afar, as if being pushed by the wind, or as if thousands of women in red were dancing in groups. The impression was better than walking through the woods by far.</p>
<p>After returning, I talked to my friends about it. They all said that this fact was as pleasing as discovering a new continent. So we discussed and planned new ways to see the flowers, and we came up with three ideas.</p>
<p>The first to speak was Mr. Shen, who said that it would be best to drive a motorboat, sail along the shallow shore, and go back and forth slowly for a deeper appreciation. We could prepare wine, dried meat, and fine tea on the boat to accompany the tour.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Shi said that it would be best to have those who have learned to swim and are good at paddling row small boats and tour, so that not only could the peach blossoms on land be appreciated to the fullest, but also the beautiful reflections on the water could be played with at will. Finally, Mr. Liang said that it would be best to sit on a Western-style small sailboat and let it drift on the gentle breeze, so that the reflection of the sail in the red flowers would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>The author said that the ideas of the three gentlemen were actually three in one. It could be generally called "A New Way to See the Peach Blossoms at Longhua". I will record it as a free talk and make it public to everyone. The three gentlemen agreed that it was good, so I wrote it down.</p>
<h3>Humorous Common Sense</h3>
<p>— Ye Limin</p>
<p>If there is a hole in the heel of a black sock,</p>
<p>and a piece of flesh is exposed when you put on your shoes, wouldn't it be very unsightly? You can use ink to paint the flesh,</p>
<p>so that people won't be able to see it anymore.</p>
<p>Do not discard a broken umbrella. You can remove the umbrella ribs and use it as a walking stick.</p>
<p>If a sock is torn, cut off the torn part. It can be used as a sleeve or a foot cover.</p>
<p>If you can't afford to buy a clock, just buy a chicken. It can tell the time, and you can also taste its meat. Wouldn't it be killing two birds with one stone?</p>
<p>It is best to buy two pairs of shoes at the same time. If one shoe is worn out, match it with one from the other pair. If another shoe is worn out, match it with another from the other pair. This is also an excellent economic method.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (167)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Red Flames Fill the Sky, the Courtyard Praises the Filial Daughter; The Red Carpet on the Ground, the Famous Actor is Met on the Spot</p>
<p>They looked at Zuo Shichen and others' tickets. There were three consecutive tickets for the 25th, 26th, and 27th. They happened to be on the left side of the third row. The audience seats in that theater were separated on both sides, with a walkway in the middle covered with a long carpet. At that time, there were already many people who had come to see the play. The place was full of men and women, mostly from academic circles. Because this kind of new play was not something that people in the intellectual class would not want to watch. Even if they watched it, they would not understand it and would not see its good points. Most of the audience who came today were family members and friends of the members of the Qingliu Society. But there were still quite a few people. By 7:15, the place was full. A dark green velvet curtain hung in front of the stage. Below the curtain, there was a row of tassels. Near the tassels, there was a very beautiful lace border. Around the perimeter of the stage, there was a row of electric lights. Outside the electric lights, there was a cover to prevent the light from irritating the eyes of the audience. Before the opening, all the lights in the entire theater were on. When the opening occurred, all the lights in the entire theater were turned off, leaving only the lights on the stage. That could make the scenery exceptionally clear and could make all the eyes of the audience in the entire theater focus on the stage. Therefore, they were paying attention to the lighting. In foreign theaters, there are people who specialize in managing the lighting. Before the opening, someone came out from the curtain to report something to the audience. Do you know who this person was? It was Lu Jun. He talked about the history of how the Qingliu Society was organized, as well as all the polite words asking for guidance. Afterwards, a profit-seeking music team played music, and the opening began immediately. Then, the play was performed act by act. It was strange that when the play was being performed on stage, many audience members did not make any noise. Only the clear words spoken on the stage could be heard. It was only when that act ended that many people started making a lot of noise, discussing the play. In the old theaters, when the actors were singing and speaking on the stage, the audience was noisy and talking about other things. There was no such concentration of attention. After two or three acts, Zuo Shichen asked Ruiyun, "Do you understand the plot of the play?" Ruiyun nodded. She said it was easy to understand because it was all in vernacular. Although they spoke Mandarin,</p>
<p>that kind of Mandarin was also easy to understand. Zuo Shichen smiled and said, "Did you bring several handkerchiefs?" Ruiyun was puzzled and said, "I only have one. Do you need to wipe your hands?" As she spoke, she handed Zuo Shichen a small, pale red silk handkerchief the size of the palm of her hand. Zuo Shichen shook his head and smiled, "It's not that I want to wipe my hands. The next two acts will be very sad. You will definitely cry when you see them. That's why I told you to prepare a handkerchief." Ruiyun said, "You mean I'm going to use it to wipe my tears? No, no. My heart is the hardest. I won't cry even if I encounter something sad. Besides, this is just a play. It's not real."</p>

<h3>Finance: The Gold Market Returns to Mediocrity</h3>
<p>The gold price outlook seems tired. Yesterday, the gold market was exceptionally calm. However, there was little room for maneuvering. The front and back markets differed by only one or two liang. Overseas markets were initially calm but later weakened. Speculators were quiet. Transactions among dealers were sparse. Buyers such as Shunli, Yuan Maoyong, etc. were relatively numerous. Yongfeng and Jin'an showed some selling. From the morning, large amounts were unmoved, seeming to trend lower. At noon, the situation became even softer, continuing to fall by one or two liang. Sellers were in the majority, and remittance drafts were turning scarce. Later in the day, the market was extremely peaceful, with only sporadic transactions, with prices moving a scant two or three qian. Also, it was Wednesday, with a lack of foreign exchange market, so the market closed early. As for the London silver bar, there were no increases or decreases in the US, etc. The market was stagnant.</p>
<p>The morning opened with an immediate drop of half a liang. The May premium gold opened at 501 liang and 7 qian, a decrease of 5 qian. The gross spread had a slight fluctuation of three to four qian. Remittance draft transactions were sluggish. The first listing was at 502 liang, the posted price was the same, and the internal position was stable. Mitsubishi sold distant-date rates of 11 pence 312 and slightly sold it off. The remittance drafts seemed to be loosening. The May advanced rate was sold by HSBC at 11 pence 25, then retreated by one liang. It was one liang and one qian after 10:30. At this time, banks purchased spot goods, so it returned to a slightly higher level, calculated at one liang and six or seven qian. However, sellers were active on the surface, so distant-date British gold bank dealings were at 11 pence 375. Distant-date Japanese gold could be settled at one liang 04 fen 375, and had already depreciated by seven or eight qian. At noon, it was 500 liang 009 qian. The closing rebounded by two or three qian, to one liang and two qian.</p>
<p>The noon close was calculated at eight qian small. The later market opened at 501 liang and 4 qian, then decreased by two qian small. The transactions in the later session were surprisingly quiet, and the price stood at one liang and two or three qian. At 2:30, there was a slight purchase, so it increased by two or three qian, to one liang and a half. Because it was Wednesday, the remittance draft market was closed as usual, and the head-of-hedges were also lonely. The market was announced closed at 2:45. The closing was 501 liang and 4 qian, a decrease of eight qian compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The listed price was suppressed by ten liang or so. The largest price for the day was 2 liang and 2 qian.</p>
<p>The smallest price was 0.9 qian, a fluctuation of one liang and three qian. The listed price was 511 liang and 8 qian, which was suppressed by a small ten liang or so. The record keeping and supplementary water were both at 501 liang. The opening price of goods was one liang and seven qian, and the closing price was one liang and two qian. The afternoon was one liang and two qian.</p>
<p>The closing price was one liang and a half.</p>
<p>Transactions were not very active. Among the dealers, Yuan Maoyong, Shunli,</p>
<p>Yu Da, etc. purchased slightly. Jin'an, Yongfeng, Yong Chengchang, Yuan Yu Yong,</p>
<p>Yuansheng, etc. all sold. Yuantai, Wanxing, Zhifeng Yong, Dade Cheng,</p>
<p>Yichang, Kunhe, etc. bought and sold differently, but the numbers were limited. Most companies were watching in the afternoon. Transactions were less than a hundred. Head-of-hedge aspects were also scarce. The Dalian gang purchased a total of 1200 to 1300 contracts in both the front and back markets, and sold 400 to 500. The Guangdong gang waited for the opportunity to move.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: Initially Calm, Later Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC foreign exchange posted prices were unchanged. Large silver contracts also had no honor or disgrace. The market was extremely stagnant. Overseas telegrams from Yokohama and Kobe were also unmoved. The local exchange in this port was initially calm, then weakened. The premium gold trended slightly lower, but was extremely calm. Therefore, Chinese merchants and speculators were watching. Only a small number traded. Only tens of thousands of pounds were in and out. Banks such as Mitsui sold, and Zhengjin purchased. Also, the banks traded two or three thousands of pounds among themselves. Ten million yuan of US dollars were settled, Mitsui sold, and the Japanese exchange was even more deserted. Head-of-hedge transactions were also lonely. Since it was Wednesday in the afternoon, the market was closed as usual, and this situation,</p>
<p>had not been seen in a long time. By noon, the market closed, compared to the 8th, the prime rate was higher by 0.0625, the US exchange was higher by 0.125, and the Japanese exchange was reduced by 0.375. The market atmosphere was like a hovering situation.</p>
<p>British Exchange: The internal rate fluctuated by only 0.0625, and transactions were sparse. This morning, the price for April was one shilling and eleven pence 125, and the buying price was 1875.

<h3>Grains: Hexia Rice Market Recovers Slightly</h3>
<p>Zhabei Hehu has opened...Sales sluggish downstream</p>
<p>Nanshi arrivals connect, turnover stagnant...Turning soft again</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday the sky was overcast and the source was desolate. Green transport merchants received news of strict restrictions from Shanghai, and waited and watched on the way, but the authorities, because of the 18 yuan price limit, were difficult to implement in fact, so they have complied with requests from all parties and approved the reply of the 20 yuan limit. Therefore, in the morning, He Cunhuo customers unanimously took out samples for sale, and the selling atmosphere was prosperous. However, the sales of northern japonica rice were surprisingly sluggish, and buyers were indifferent, so the market price suddenly fell by about two jiao, and the middle and secondary batches fell even more. The market situation has turned depressed, and the sales of thin rice are also stagnant, and transactions are still not developing. Fortunately, the bottom goods are not thick and rushed, so the price is only a small angle, Yangxian and Dukexian feet are more stable, and the existence is not prosperous, so the overall market is stable. There are a small number of Yin Yuan's appetites, and the market is neither glorious nor humiliating. The total number of Hehu for the whole day is more than 2,000 stones.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Although the arrival of the river is not smooth, there are still accumulated goods, and the source of Nalu rice is also connected. The buying accounts in this street were still active at first, and then they received news from the downstream of the North City, and the market exchange was suddenly slack. Changsu various japonica rice then turned to a large market and were about half a jiao tired, and the price of goods in the same village had to be reduced by more than two jiao. It can be seen that the price of rice has reached its peak recently, so once the market becomes stagnant, the price difference of goods is often more than one jiao. Nanbang Chonggu Qingjiao Liantang and other thin rice and early rice, the market appetite is silent, and the sales place is extremely small. Ningbang also feels like waiting and watching, and the market price softens with the japonica rice market. There are not many arrivals of Yangbu various indica rice, the store's appetite is slightly moving, and the market surface is flat. Baiyuan and Dukexian have arrived, the turnover is not happy, and the price is standing.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Steps Up by Two Jiao</h3>
<p>The price of foreign rice futures is expected to rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, not much new foreign rice arrived, and the turnover was particularly good. There were major gangs from inland Ningbo, Wenzhou, Taiwan, Jiangbei and the local street competing for it. The market price rose accordingly. The spot rice jumped up again by two jiao due to the competition among customers. The road goods were similar. The foreign rice in the futures market is optimistic, and the producing area reported an increase, so there are few sales, and the price is also rising outside the coin. The unified market opened: No. 1 Saigon rice 3,000 bags, price 15 yuan half, 15 yuan 3.7 jiao, No. 2 Saigon 500 bags, price 14 yuan 8.5 jiao, small twisted 2,000 bags, price 14 yuan 8.5 jiao to 14 yuan 7 jiao, large twisted 2,000 bags, price 14 yuan 5 or 6 jiao, road loan includes large and small twisted Min Dang and other 15,000 bags, futures 3,000 tons of ,</p>
<p>Return is the majority.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Wheat Futures are Firm, Distant-Term is Flat</h3>
<p>Manufacturers are rumored to receive goods this month...Transactions are suddenly active...Spot Wuxi manufacturers purchase in Shanghai...Opening price is therefore clever</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, the market of each month, showed a near-term firm and distant-term flat phenomenon. This month, it is rumored that the manufacturer still intends to receive goods, and because the current wheat market has a very good appetite, Gao Mai shouted a few points, so people's hearts are very firm, and transactions are also very smooth. And the main reason for this is that the previous month's collection price reached two and a half qian, but now it is not one qian, which is inevitably too contrary to the facts. The sudden increase in buying interest is probably the reason for this. Distant-term transactions were also booming, but the weather has improved, and people's hearts have not been tightened. As a result, this month is three fen better than the previous day.</p>
<p>June is unchanged, July is one fen smaller, August is one fen larger, September is the same. Spot wheat market, yesterday the asking price of high-quality goods was three or four fen higher.</p>
<p>Because Wuxi manufacturers' wheat prices in this area are higher than in the inland, there is a rumor that they will purchase in Shanghai and then transport them to the inland. Therefore, the asking prices of each stall have become visible. Open the price of Suzhou wheat at 5 taels 1 qian 7 fen, Jiangxi wheat at 5 taels 02 fen, 4 taels qian, Hankou wheat at 4 taels 8 qian 8 fen, 4 taels 7 qian, a total of 6 trips and more bags, newly opened factory bought it.</p>
<h3>Standard Flour Seems to Turn Soft</h3>
<p>Actual sales are not prosperous due to the situation and high prices</p>
<p>Although the price of foreign wheat has risen, the heart is still soft</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for each month of the flour market generally turned soft. Because the current actual sales are brought with the situation and the market price is too high, it is not cost-effective, and most people are waiting and watching. According to the standard , it is roughly that it is difficult to attract appetite unless it is a few points lower. And the long side, it seems that the industry is mostly occupied, in the actual sales of no forward, the market can not be restored, it can not help but gradually return out, so the quotation of foreign wheat is difficult to see a rebound, the hearts of the people are still tired.</p>
<p>Each month to distant-term, because the weather turns better, warm and comfortable, people's hearts are also weak. Looking at this month, if the actual sales are stagnant and the small manufacturers' sales are not made up, this kind of price can be fixed. The distant-term is still far away, and it needs to be turned around by the weather. As a result, this month is seven li and a half less than the previous month, May is five li less, June, July and August are seven li and a half less, and September is five li less.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Demand for Chinese Silk is High and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>New York factory increased by 89 cents...Lyon increased by 12 francs Recently, in the overseas market, because the price of Japanese silk was high, they waited and watched, and the Japanese government allocated funds to protect the silk price expansion and joint custody. Japanese silk exports have decreased sharply, European and American consumption is not weak, and the stock of silk is gradually thinning. The demand for Chinese silk has increased. Last week, the Chinese, American and French markets purchased a large amount of Cantonese silk. Now that the exchange rate has strengthened, the factory's purchasing appetite has become more smooth, and the prices have risen sharply. New York Zhongshen Shanghai White Factory's opening price on Monday rose by 89 US cents per pound. The superior and superior current factory of Lyon also increased by 12 francs per kilo. The yesterday's market turnover of Shanghai's current and current factories was also strong. Ganli entered 90 bags of Shanghai White Factory, Luhuang Factory 30 bags, and Gray Factory 20 bags. The prices are clearly firm and secretly rising.</p>
<h3>Textiles: The Origin of the Sharp Rise in Fine Cloth</h3>
<p>Customer sales are booming...The stock bottom is empty</p>
<p>Yesterday, the fine cloth of this factory's cotton cloth rebounded, with a great tendency to reach the peak. This is because the actual sales are smooth, but the stock bottom is empty. The factory's opening loan has been sold to July, and the goods in May and June have also been sold. And the number of dealers who sell to the customer gang is very large, and they have not yet been delivered. The Tianjin gang has settled the price according to the current market, which makes the market higher and higher. The turnover of dyed cloth is still smooth, so the tight situation is rare in recent years. Fine twill is softer with blue double fish, and Yanghe is also quite clever. Crude cloth Tianjin gang traded more than 200 pieces, but the crude twill turnover is still sluggish.</p>
<p>The market situation of East-West textiles has turned stable, and the rising wind of East goods has subsided. The actual sales are not moving, so there is no ability to continue to rise. Yesterday, fine, Zhigong Ni, etc. were unchanged. Although there is a saying that white crepe cloth has increased in price, but the hand goods are still sold at three taels. The dealer opened at three taels and one qian. Dian Qiuxiang Yuanyang yarn, which was once in short supply, will arrive next Monday, and the opening price is eight taels and four qian half. Tang Taizong is still eight taels and two qian half. Light-colored printed colors are added in this street. Tang Taizong sells one qian nine fen half, Shou Lao riding a deer two qian, Chongsu silk Xuzhou Zhoucun and other gangs slightly added, yesterday cute beauty Zha blue three taels nine qian, foreign blue three taels eight qian, civilization style has arrived in Shanghai in large quantities, the price is from one qian seven fen to one qian seven fen seven li and a half, Western goods bleached cloth Yangtze River Gang is quite active, Heji Guan Bao opened ten taels, Taihe Chicken eleven taels two qian half, all have been sold.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: The Rising and Falling of the Asphalt Market</h3>
<p>Asphalt sales have been divided equally between candle making and soap making for nearly ten years. At the beginning of this late spring, candle makers are preparing for the summer season, and soap factories are also preparing raw materials because soap sales are about to boom. However, since the two famous soap factories in Shanghai sold soap at a low price two years ago, all smaller soap factories have been affected and have reduced their scope, so sales have also changed accordingly. In the past, retail sales were more common, but now they have become integer. The more small soap factories there are, the more retail sales are booming, and the more large soap factories promote their business, the more integer there are. Although the sales of each asphalt line have not decreased, the conversion from retail to integer is not as profitable as before. Because large soap factories are serious about purchasing goods, the price is also harsh,</p>
<p>unlike small soap factories that can settle for cheaper prices without paying attention to the quality of the goods. As for the candle making end, because the summer season must take high-quality materials, unlike soap making, which only takes cheap prices and does not talk about the quality of the goods. Recently, both kinds of supplies are in demand, and sales are endless. Because the source of Hankou's market was not prosperous half a month ago, the price of the factory's asphalt rose to fourteen taels and eight qian, and then fell to thirteen taels and four qian due to the arrival of goods. Chongjing also rose to fifteen taels. However, the occasional shortage of goods during the spring season will see a rise, only the pyramid flower will appear and cannot last. According to the recent details of the Hankou letter, there are more incoming goods of hemp oil, and the market is also flat. Zhu Hong Chongjing is at fourteen taels, Sanheng is at thirteen taels and enters money, Zazhong and Zhijiang are at thirteen taels six or seven qian, Pingjing is at thirteen taels four or five qian, and Tianjin is at thirteen taels two or three qian. The spring flood in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has not yet started, and the incoming goods cannot rush in for a while, so the market is not too cheap.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Military Metal Products Trading Alone is Booming</h3>
<p>In recent days, the number of military metal products negotiations and the prosperity of the transactions are the crown of each cargo. According to statistics, the total amount is 7,800 dan, which is distributed to Hankou and Tianjin. Such as garden lead wire, small tinplate, No. 10, No. 12</p>
<p>No. 14, new lead wire, etc., each have one or two thousand dan. In addition, white lead skin, black iron skin, angle iron, tin, and copper are also said to be many.</p>
<p>As for the main road goods such as plain white iron, French West nails, and English steel plates, there have been very few transactions recently, and the market is quite lonely.</p>

<h3>Late Marriage and Celibacy in Ireland</h3>
<p>By Fran.</p>
<p>The recently published Volume 5 of the 1926 census of the Irish Free State, a portion of which is specifically devoted to discussing the marriage age and reproductive status of the people of that nation,</p>
<p>is capable of arousing a strong interest in readers. It is claimed that the male and female citizens of the Free State marry particularly late,</p>
<p>and even those who remain unmarried for life are quite numerous. Generally speaking, among men between the ages of twenty-five and thirty, those who are unmarried account for 80 percent; between thirty-five and forty, the unmarried account for 5 percent; and between fifty-five and sixty-five, the unmarried account for 26 percent.</p>
<p>Such figures can truly be considered unique in the world. Among European countries, the closest comparison to Ireland is Sweden, where the percentages of unmarried men in the three age groups mentioned above are 64, 25, and 12. Next are places like Finland, Northern Ireland, and Estonia, which are roughly similar to Sweden. As for Italy, the percentages of unmarried men in these three age groups are 53, 17, and 9 respectively. Scotland and Denmark are similar. England and Wales have figures of 45, 16,</p>
<p>and 10. Portugal and Germany are roughly similar to England.</p>
<p>Regarding women, the Irish Free State also consistently shows that they are among the women who marry the latest or the least. The following is a table listing their ages and the percentage of unmarried women:</p>
<p>Age　Percentage</p>
<p>25 to 30　62</p>
<p>30 to 35　42</p>
<p>35 to 40　32</p>
<p>55 to 65　24</p>
<p>At the same time, in Northern Ireland, unmarried women account for 52 percent of those between 25 and 30 years old, 31 percent of those between 35 and 40 years old, and 26 percent of those between 55 and 60 years old. Sweden, Finland, and Switzerland show similar figures, but the percentage of unmarried women between 55 and 65 years old is all below 20. As for England and Wales, the figures are 41, 20, and 15. The percentages of unmarried women in other countries such as Denmark, Italy, and Germany are lower in every age group.</p>
<p>According to the Director of Statistics of the Free State, the number of people resisting marriage among the residents of the 26 counties has increased year by year since 1841.</p>
<p>In that year, only 43 percent of all men between 25 and 35 years old were unmarried, but by 1926, this had risen to 72 percent. Furthermore, in 1861, unmarried men between 55 and 65 years old</p>
<p>accounted for only 11 percent, but by 1926, this had risen to 26 percent.</p>
<p>The situation for women is generally the same. In 1841, unmarried women accounted for only 28 percent of all women between 25 and 35 years old, but by 1926, this had risen to as high as 53 percent. Furthermore, in 1861, unmarried women accounted for only 13 percent of women between 55 and 65 years old, but by 1926, the number of old maids in this age group had increased to as high as 24 percent.</p>
<p>If one were to say that the desire to emigrate is the reason for the increasing trend of resisting marriage, I am afraid that this reason would not be satisfactory. This is because if one intends to emigrate, one should marry as early as possible. According to the analysis of figures, men in the rural areas of the Free State marry much later than those in the cities, and men in the cities of the Free State marry much later than those in the cities of other countries. However, this is not so true for women. If one were to say that this is due to the oppression of poverty, this would not be an appropriate explanation either, because the average wealth per person in Ireland is indeed greater than in 1880, 1860, and 1840, but the marriage ages of men and women were much earlier at that time. How can this be explained?</p>
<p>However, although men and women in the Free State marry later</p>
<p>and less often, the reproductive capacity of women in that country is indeed not small. Generally speaking, the ratio of children under the age of five to married women under the age of forty-five is as high as 131 percent, which must be said to be the highest ratio in all of Europe, because Norway accounts for 118 percent,</p>
<p>Finland accounts for 114 percent, Sweden accounts for 103 percent,</p>
<p>Canada accounts for 96 percent, Denmark accounts for 93 percent, New Zealand accounts for 82 percent, Germany accounts for 75 percent, and England and Wales account for 71 percent. Ireland has consistently maintained this record since 1861, while only England and Wales have decreased from 116 to 71.</p>
<p>Because women have such a high fertility rate, even if they marry late, the result is that Irish children can still receive a fair distribution, and there is no fear of scarcity. Therefore, among every hundred people aged fifteen to sixty-five in that country,</p>
<p>there are an average of 47 children under the age of fifteen. Compared with other countries, Portugal and Norway both have 53, Italy and Denmark both have 50, England and Wales have 37, Sweden, Finland, and Switzerland all have 43, and France has the fewest, with only 32, while the Free State is unwilling to show weakness in this regard.</p>
<p>The lives of women in the Free State are not as comfortable as those of women in England, and the situation of most unmarried women is particularly difficult, but the lives of their men are better than those of England, and can even be ranked first in the world. This is because the agricultural situation in that country is suitable for men.</p>
<h3>China Should Design to Attract Foreign Tourists</h3>
<p>The China Review states that Shanghai is a thoroughfare for tourists coming and going in the Far East, but it has not become a tourist center, which is a great pity. According to the statistics of various shipping companies, nearly 40,000 tourists from various countries in the world pass through Shanghai every year, but Shanghai actually lacks scenic spots that can make foreign guests linger and enjoy themselves. From a national and economic point of view, this is all a pity. Since tourists arrive in Shanghai, they have nothing to miss, and at most stay for one or two days before leaving, which causes the local commercial sector to lose a great opportunity. Assuming that 40,000 tourists spend 100 Mexican dollars a day, the Shanghai public can enjoy a profit of 4 million dollars a year. If these 40,000 people can be induced to stay for ten days, a profit of 40 million dollars can be obtained.</p>
<p>Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, and other countries</p>
<p>all attract tourists to reap commercial benefits. This year, Japan is spending 100,000 dollars in advertising expenses in the United States to recruit tourists. Manila is also using various methods to attract tourists, such as carnivals.</p>
<p>Attracting tourists, foreigners coming to the Far East in the future will follow one after another. Shanghai should quickly catch up and create an important tourist destination in the East. The first thing to do is to seek convenience for tourists. Although Shanghai lacks good scenery, it is not far from Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Songjiang. Trains can reach these places directly. In addition to West Lake, Hangzhou has extremely good scenic spots in its vicinity. The automobile road is under construction. Now it is appropriate to rush to build the Hangzhou-Shanghai automobile road and build a first-class modern hotel in Hangzhou that can accommodate hundreds of people, with equipment for boating, horse riding, fishing, etc. In addition, automobile roads should also be opened between Shanghai and Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing, with various sports facilities attached.</p>
<p>If a park can be built along the edge of Lake Tai in Wuxi, it will surely be a popular destination for foreigners.</p>
<p>This kind of major project requires an investment of several million dollars, but in the future, it can absorb hundreds of millions of foreign dollars, which is worth spending. When Chinese and foreign tourists are prosperous, local commerce will flourish greatly, and Shanghai residents will also have a place to visit and relax on weekends and holidays. Other provinces have made great progress in opening automobile roads, but Shanghai alone is lagging behind, which is very strange. According to the report of the Road Improvement Association, the mileage of all automobile roads in China has increased from 4,000 miles in the tenth year of the Republic of China to 86,000 miles in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Between the fourteenth and nineteenth years, it doubled. In the single year of the eighteenth year, it increased by 23,000 miles, but Shanghai's automobile roads are still very lacking. This matter should be urgently planned and implemented by a committee jointly formed by the central government and the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and should not be delayed any longer. After this move is completed, all parties will benefit from it, which is much more glorious for the country than welcoming a foreign prince and embracing Buddha's feet at the last minute, demolishing the thatched huts of the poor on a large scale.</p>
<p>However, it must be noted that the construction of automobile roads must be a truly good road, and should not be like Nanjing's Zhongshan Avenue, which is only in name. It is especially hoped that the cost of road construction will be reduced as much as possible, and should not be like Zhongshan Avenue, which wastes huge amounts of money. As far as we know, some officials in the interior have forcibly occupied people's land and houses and included them in the automobile road route without giving adequate compensation. This is done in the name of national construction, which is very inappropriate. It is deeply hoped that this will not happen again when building roads in the future. We would rather Shanghai lose 40 million dollars a year than see the poor people of China suffer this tyranny. In short, whether the Danish prince and American rich can see China's "paradise on earth" (referring to Suzhou and Hangzhou) has little to do with our people, but that private property of the people should forever be private property of the people</p>
<p>is very important.</p>
<h3>Four New Planets Beyond Neptune</h3>
<p>Probably No Human Habitation</p>
<p>Rome Dispatch:  Professor Bian Tangdi, a famous Italian astronomer and meteorologist, discovered four new planets beyond Neptune.  He is now discussing his research with guests, saying that he does not believe that humans live on these new planets.  "These planets are extremely far from the sun, and their material conditions are very underdeveloped.  Therefore, to say that humans live there is nonsense.  These planets are still in an embryonic state and are millions of years behind Earth.  Their development will take millions of years more.  I used all the mathematical methods used by astronomers to discover these new planets.  As such, it proves that the scope of the solar system is much larger than imagined,</p>
<p>in fact, about fifty times larger than currently imagined," he said.</p>
<h3>British Farmers Decide to Try Planting Artificial Cotton</h3>
<p>Another New Industry</p>
<p>London Dispatch:  More than two hundred farmers near Shipley, England, held a meeting and decided to try planting a kind of grass that can replace cotton.  In the future, this grass will be used instead of cotton.  If it is successful, it will be cheaper than real cotton.  It is expected that Shipley will become the center of this new industry.</p>
<h3>The Human Body is Worth Only Two and a Half Dollars Chemically</h3>
<p>Determined by the British Health Insurance Association</p>
<p>According to the research results of the medical department of the British National Health Insurance Commission, the chemical value of the human body is, on average, only about two and a half Chinese silver dollars per person. The chemical substances in the body are as follows:</p>
<p>Enough fat to make seven bars of soap,</p>
<p>Enough iron to make one medium-sized nail,</p>
<p>Enough lime to fill a small sugar bowl,</p>
<p>Enough lime to whitewash a chicken coop,</p>
<p>Enough phosphorus to make 2,200 matches,</p>
<p>Enough salt to make a pinch of salt,</p>
<p>Enough potassium to explode a toy firecracker,</p>
<p>Enough sulfur to remove fleas from a dog's body.</p>
