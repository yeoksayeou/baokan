<h3>日內閣對華之新時代外交</h3>
<p>日內閣於選舉勝利後。濱口幣原表示對華外交方針。力主一反田中內閣不合時勢之逆轉政策。而代以穏固堅實之新時代的外交。日本各報之評論。多表贊助而加以督促。東京朝日謂爲刷新外交之好機會。報知新聞謂對華外交。勿效前閣急功好利。用心之外更須用心。商業新報謂現內閣宜善用此機。努力開一新生面時事新報則謂。幣原外交旣立基礎。可一掃從前之不安。更望加以努力。是日本之輿論。亦一致贊助當局刷新政策之成功。但若徒刷新面目。而不刷新根本主張。恐仍無補於事實也。</p>
<p>此次政友會選舉之失敗。固由於國民嫌惡田中武斷政策之結果。田中之武斷政策。不僅使其國內政治日趨腐敗。綱紀日漸廢弛。經濟日陷枯窘。且其對華侵略之心。日益急進。所有種種行動。徒招致我國人民之憤激。影響及於中日貿易。故在日本國民亦甚表示不滿。此誠爲政友失敗之眞因今日內閣旣覺悟及此。則應力除前內閣之根本誤點。放棄在中國以非法手段。所取得種種爲世界譏枰之權利。而代以平等互助開誠相與之精神政策。始能謂之刷新外交。始合於所謂新時代外交之方式也。若僅僅放棄前內閣之武力侵略政策。而代以柔軟手段。一方面仍堅持其傳統一貫之政策。一方面欲在手段上講求所以刷新之法。恐終爲不可能之事也。不然幣原之外交政策。曰改善中日國際關係。曰中日共存共榮。曰努力增進中日邦交之親善。亦旣屢屢宣示矣。何以中國人民。對於此等表示。漠然不動於中。而反疑幣原之外交爲虛僞。爲空泛。此則日內閣應平心靜思。有以示我民以新時代外交之實者也。</p>

<h3>銀價跌後之哈埠商業</h3>
<p>▲俄亂後尙未復原</p>
<p>▲陡又加一重創鉅</p>
<p>二十一日哈爾濱通訊、金潮發生銀價跌落後、使俄亂甫定、將次復原之哈市商業、又因而跌入於呆滯不振之中、迄一月來、各業均呈凋敝之象、前途恢復、一時無望、沿途各市鎭如不早恢復原狀、金價仍然跌落、則哈商業殆陷於絕境矣、茲分述各業狀况如後、</p>
<p>▲雜貨商　雜貨商廢曆年中結賑時、因虧賠不克支持倒閉者、經道裏外兩商會調查、計共四百二十一二家、因營業不振、收縮營業者、三百○四家、鉅商如同發隆·大羅新·公和利·恒順昌等、均僅足支持、未致賠錢而已、倒閉商號、多爲三四等資本約在三二十萬元左右者、其原因一由於俄亂後沿江沿鐵各市鎭商業未復、輸出之路壅閉、哈市行銷、双難與鉅商爭衡、金潮發生、平日購貨需三錢者、刻須加價、哈洋同時毛荒不振、貨物一經批躉、金價盤旋不定、賣入哈洋雖已加利有益、但向滬歸欵時、則爾時金價又不知漲至如何程度、前途旣無希望、益以哈市蕭索、貨積難銷、遂不得不宣告停業、</p>
<p>▲糧石商　糧石商業、爲哈埠主要商業之一、向恃屯積大豆小麥以對貿易供給歐亞原料者、不下數百家、銀價未跌前、新糧上市、適値中俄戰事方殷、歐亞交通中斷、歐商不來購批、銷路絕斷、直無營業可信、交通恢復後、金價飛騰、歐商來購以往昔一斗之値、可購去二斗糧商屯糧、多在金在價平穏之時、此時忍痛賣出、則關係血本、否則積壓資金、欵項不靈、於是又不得不稍稍賣出、雖賠錢無如何也、故本年廢歷元旦後、縮小範圍、或改業其他者、以此類商號最多、</p>
<p>▲麵粉與油業　麵粉廠與油坊、與糧石商同佔哈商重要地位、去歲俄亂、當局禁麵粉出口、各麵粉廠不得不减少磨力、幷暫時停製、但因麵禁關係、遂令南滿一帶之銷路、爲美國麵粉所侵佔、戰事平定、金潮澎湃、美麵挾其經濟威勢、减價出售、哈麵以原價過昂貶價競爭、力所不能、乃致坐令銷路縮短、又油坊油餅、往時可銷行赴歐、刻亦以銀跌原因、歐去賠錢不能外運、</p>
<p>▲金票與哈洋　金銀價格在哈、向爲八三與一七之比、每兩赤金兌哈洋八十三元、每兩規銀兌哈洋十七元、自金貴後、赤金已漲至每兩十一元一角、規銀則跌至一元二角四分、津滬洋每元兌哈票祗一元二角三分上下、向來哈市現洋流行、爲鳳毛麟角、頃亦散見於市、日本金票價格、雖似稍提、第較金價來勢緩和、故前與滬地往來商號、今則均轉向大連·大阪、無形中金票爲銀跌後哈市之主幣、而哈市亦爲日本一商業尾閭、哈票兌銀價格雖稍見好、顧對金票之屈服、較前更甚、在此銀跌中银行方面、猶濫發不兌現紙幣、使市面經濟益加恐慌、特區長官公署、日前布告謂哈票未經蓋監理官印者秒得行駛市面、然票經蓋戳矣、其數目仍未减少、間接於金漲中、仍予商業經濟民生物質以大影響茲調查各號發行哈票數目如下、（一）東三省官銀號、十元券一千一百萬元、五元券二百萬元、一元券一百萬元、共一千四百萬元、（二）邊業银行、十元券五百萬元、五元券三百五十萬元、一元券二十萬元、共計八百七十萬元、（三）中國銀行、十元券二百萬元、五元券一百萬元、一元券五十萬元、共計三百五十萬元、（四）廣信公司、十元券一百萬元五元券一百萬元、一元券十萬元、共二百十萬元、（五）交通銀行、十元券六百萬元五元券二百五十萬元、一元券五十萬元、共計九百萬元、以上五家行號、統共發行三千七百三十萬元、角票猶不在內、金潮起後、哈商旣受銀跌之餘、俄亂之害、復益以哈票之害、一蹶不振、爲害正不悉伊於胡底也、</p>

<h3>台災記慘</h3>
<p>— 姸千</p>
<p>友人朱五蜨。去冬襄辦台災急賑。頃爲述災况綦詳。傾聽之下。頗用不安。因撮誌慘狀。藉自由談以告痌瘝在抱之同胞。</p>
<p>▲食糧三種　台災之烈。當已爲讀者所</p>
<p>熟知矣。則今茲所謂食糧三種。其粗惡蓋可想見。一、最上等之食糧爲糠。食時一如餵猪飼牛。水略煑而已。故食糠者脹死甚多。二、中等之食糧爲野茡薺。此物自然生於田中。平時農家以其碍稻之生長。甚惡之。不期乃於荒年被視爲無上珍品。頗有恨不多生之慨也。食法。先將荸薺連皮切碎。然後磨細煮之。因連皮。故色紫。此物甚似荸薺而小。至大不過如大拇指粗也。三、下等之食糧爲莠草之根。亦磨成粉。煑爲麫糊狀而食之。味略帶苦云。</p>
<p>▲簔衣作被　災民大多以簔衣作被。初以爲彼處貧户習之如是。後經探詢。始知因災後無以果腹。於典當俱空之時。已以之質入長生庫易錢延命。故以禦雨之具。代抗寒之物焉。</p>
<p>▲賣女慘聞　災民之有少妻弱女者。輒於無以爲計之時。挈妻女往他鄕出賣。有東洋下半莊一災民。因妻懷孕將產。保產育兒之費分文無着。惟有女已長大。不得已乃與妻商决。挈女赴甬賣之。以濟急需。無如時乖運蹇。一留月餘。方得脫售。雖獲銀一百二十餘元。然淸償房飯金後。已所留無幾。迨抵家。腰間僅剩兩元幾角。夫妻相見之下。大哭竟日。直欲覓死。�</p>
<p>幸爲人苦勸而止。</p>
<h3>記滬紳公祭明覺法師</h3>
<p>— 聽冰生</p>
<p>十九年春二月。海上士紳。假英租界�</p>
<p>報本堂設座。公祭普陀山明覺方丈到塲奠祭者二百餘人。其盛况已載各報。而佛堂素壁。遍張輓聯。佳作如林。足供參閱。歴數五千年來。死後哀榮。僧界惟此一人耳。王一亭輓云。「先了夙世緣。六旬乃栽祇樹。」「今證此生果。一笑而拈曇花。」殊爲簡當。于右任輓云。「吳江月映浮提樹。」「洛水雲歸摩頂松。」則寫作俱佳。又諦閑一聯云。「從儒入釋。即妄融眞。祇望永作普渡慈航。誰料兩岸不居歸常寂。」「冲遽幽奇。舉文難述。唯希長爲名山領袖。那知六通自在證蓮邦。」雖對仗不能盡工。而與方丈身前之事業。繊無　格之處。亦殊可嘉。又普濟寺退居蓮曦�</p>
<p>輓云。「君竟歸乎。凈土蓮邦儘堪託足。」</p>
<p>吾亦老矣。名山佛地誰負仔肩。」則又不免流於感歎自悼之辭矣。是日僕曾參與祭儀。微聞方丈之俗家子相國慶君。客臘奔喪到山。風塵滿頰。不勝哀思。而能承父志。捐資行善。普陀山一帶居民。咸食其德。相君又言。先父明覺。歸依佛山。十年於茲。而建功樹德。豈堪勝舉。如普陀山之創修如意寮。設立念佛堂。彌不苦心經營。盡力募化。需時經年。費資盈萬。而先父不自稍煩其勞。又因常年經費之不足醫藥費之無着。及其易簀。猶顧左右而言曰。願我佛門子弟。竭盡心力。創業以濟貧窶無告者。則我心安矣。是故棘人爲仰體親心。願捐助三千五百元。歸寺庫保存。作爲病者藥費。以冀維持永久。而繼先人之志云云。其言亦足深思焉。</p>
<h3>誌世界大城</h3>
<p>— 方愼盫</p>
<p>華僑劉君。於兩年前倐病中風。曾至巴黎倫敦等處就醫。迄無效愈。去秋歸國。就診於余。數日後言語即淸。甚有興致。每至敝寓就針後。暢談西貢風土。有聞所未聞者。書之以當異聞。</p>
<p>西貢之鄰名髙棉者。爲法蘭西屬地。其地距西貢四百五十幾羅米。（每千碼爲一幾羅米）由西貢乘電車。兩日可到。中有二古城。一名吳哥鬱。一名吳哥逑（讀屯）兩城相離甚近。二城之週圍有數十里。高有數十丈。全用丈餘見方之巨石砌成。石上均鐫有古衣冠之人物。怪樣之鳥獸。奇異之花草。鐫刻之工。絕非出於凡手。據花旗某工程師計算。需二十萬人。費時二百年。方可造成。金錢則無法預計也。尙有多處工程。云非機器人工所能造成者。城中土人衣均黃色。深信佛敎。多誦經咒。此城之始於何時。已失稽考。吳哥𨑾成後。城中小塔甚多。城牆之鐫刻極爲工細。吳哥鬱城工亦甚細。惟城中有一大塔。在工將完時天已大明。城牆尙缺一洞。至今如故。法人以水門汀補之。轉瞬即脫。城由法人營二大旅舍爲遊人棲宿之所。華人亦有在城中作小本營生者。現保護此城古蹟之權。係屬法人。據世界遊歷家言。此城眞爲全世界第一云。</p>
<h3>續記諸曁西鄉之虎</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>吾邑（諸曁）西鄕十三都黃家湖村王姓獵户日前獵獲一巨虎。運至杭垣銷售。事已詳見各報及本刋。茲余姪新自里來滬。昨過庽劇談。謂親見該巨虎由多人舁入城內。當時並聞獵户等所述獵獲情形。報載逈異。且其事頗趣。爰續記之。王姓兄弟甲乙丙三人。平日除耕種外。兼事行獵。廢曆正月初九日晚十時許。諸人已入睡鄕。甲婦獨臥樓下一室。房門未閑婦忽覺床榻掀動。醒而大駭。疑爲穿窬者匿伏床下。亟披衣下床。奪門而出。不敢逕自登樓。先入隣家求援。謂有贼在室。並喚諸人起。乃踰牆而下。自窗外窺之。則蹲於床上者。赫然一巨虎也。衆遂登樓穴樓板。用槍下射。中虎腰。虎負痛大吼一聲。屋瓦爲震。衆咸股慄。、繼見其寂然無聲息。始相將入室。權之重八百餘斤。雙目未闔。尙虎虎有生氣。旋運之杭。售諸胡慶餘堂。據老於行獵者言。該虎年齡當有七十五歲。是眞可謂老虎矣。按虎聞入人家。何不覓人而噬。旣見婦下床。何以並不加害。迨婦已去。乃又箕踞登床。抑亦異已。</p>
<p>余姪又謂曁之北鄕。一都地方。去臘大雪時。曾獵得猩猩一頭。大如十五六歲童子。當時獵者四人。見猩猩困雪中。擬向之開槍。猩猩亟搖手。作乞憐狀。遂束手就縳。錮於室中。復剪去其爪甲。敲去其門牙數個。現擬得善價而沽云。</p>
<h3>香煙趣屑</h3>
<p>— 颜也</p>
<p>香烟一物。幾成爲國人普遍之嗜好矣。余亦好此。十年如一日。日且二十支。所幸喜吸國貨。金錢尙未外溢也。年來耳聞目擊。關於香烟之趣事頗多。爰錄一二。以告讀者。</p>
<p>杭州有周姓家。於日前來一鄕親。捧茗敬烟。應接如儀。閑談移時。午膳矣。主人捧盤出。有酒有食。佈置旣竟。肅客入座。時客適香烟在手。吸未及半。視桌上無可置放。又以棄之可惜。即去灰燼。納諸嚢中而就座。主人亦未之覺也。迨食將半。忽一縷淸烟。由客衣襟間婢嬝出。客固未覺。主人亦不以爲意。無何。烟益濃。客以佳餚當前。祗知狼呑虎讌。仍未知星星之火之起於肘腋間也。主人呼之始覺。急解衣。則果香烟之死灰復燃。餘燼猶未盡。衣洞已宛然。詎知解衣生風。皮袍之毛忽熊熊大燃。客措手不及駭而狂躍。主人亦呼。瞥見几上有水盈盆。即持之傾其身。客經冷水灌頂。躍始停。而火亦滅。然白毛已有大塊若紫羔矣。後由主人出衣令易。始入席就飲焉。</p>
<p>海上有某大敎授。嗜香烟甚除在敎室講學外。幾無時不一捲在乎也。去歲雙十節後。彼忽擯棄不吸。知者異之。嗣詢其故。則喟然曰。余幾以此致巨禍也。一日在校。上課之鈴已噹噹響。適接家書。事急。須即復。立伏案揮毫。而烟瘾又至。急忙中將燃餘火柴向後一擲。仍速作書。詎料余書未就。身後已熊熊起火。蓋牀帳委地。火柴適擲其上。遂致延燒而上。急擲筆施救。倉卒中祇知兩手狂撲。不知呼援。然隻手胡濟。故頃刻間帳焚及半。被亦延及。濃烟向窗外奔突。室外人狂呼。路警亦狂吹其警笛矣。校工擔水至。凡四桶。火遽止。迨夫烟消旣竟。余始如夢醒悟。而視兩手。則均焦黑。頓覺奇痛。急入醫院。計十日始愈。自經斯役。乃惡烟如蠍。誓不再吸矣。</p>
<h3>常識拾零</h3>
<p>— 湯筆花</p>
<p>初交朋友。要知道他的性情。只要同他全叉一塲麻雀。那麽就可以知道他的脾氣。可交與否。一目瞭然。</p>
<p>馬路上分送的五色傳單。如果是共產黨發的反動標語。切勿要拿。恐怕給探　捕瞧見了。要疑惑你是共產份子尤其是在華界。更要注意。</p>
<p>初到上海的朋友。走在路上。遇到巡捕抄靶子的時候。切勿驚惶。須要態度鎭靜。把兩臂提高。任他搜查。切勿逃避。要防巡捕誤會你是匪類。說不定開起槍來。性命攸關。</p>
<p>居家不幸遇盜。時難以報警。如果裝有電燈的。可將電燈泡除下。向地下一擲。砰然一聲。盜必驚走。最好從樓上擲下。其聲更宏。此法已經有人試過。很有效騐。但切勿狂呼捉盜。恐有性命之虞。</p>

<h3>紗花　標紗仍在賣方壓制中</h3>
<p>紗市始漲繼疲　良以時局多謠、底貨增厚、故多數心理觀低、逢高賣風即熾、因之市盤仍難立定、目前被賣方壓制甚烈、但一般穏健者對於五十一兩外之價、皆不敢貿然做空、照大勢情形、如無十分惡劣環境、或有一度盤旋也、</p>

<h3>棉花漲勢銳厲</h3>
<p>棉市轉堅、且漲勢甚銳、蓋以外棉轉漲、外滙狂縮、本棉各路來源缺乏、漢帮關緊不售、及在標準市塲上大批吸收、棉市前途、殊難預測也、　　▲漢標激漲半兩外　期棉前市開盤、以美棉連漲兩日、散户扒空、漢帮拉緊不放、形勢更挺、各月漲三四錢、午後市氣仍硬、各月又漲一·二錢全日成交三萬六千六百担漢標收盤價列左、漢標　收盤漲跌　　　　存賬數　　　收盤　　　　漲跌　　存賬數</p>

<h3>外棉漲多跌少</h3>

<h3>糧食　河下米市呆靜</h3>
<p>▲閘北　昨日適値月杪、雙方結賬關係、交易寥寥、裹路來源約三十號左右、常帮白粳高貨仍少、而中次等粳、本街大多觀望、故產訊雖告緊、盤面仍轉萎疲、緣前兩市提升後、銷胃减稀、形勢欠佳、交易沉靜、薄稻有少數客户動辦、惟到頭續旺、價尙平靜、羊杜客秈來源旣少、洋米又因金市狂漲增價、故秈米貨主大有非漲不售之槪、幸買胃不爽、大盤祗帶堅而已、白元在本埠不易向上、而裏路金壇、溧陽·江北等處近忽步昂、據聞有特别客帮暢辦、故陡漲不已、因此申市由疲而堅矣、</p>
<p>▲滬南　河下來船甚接、此間存貨頗厚、常錫高機粳街銷不寂、蘇同機粳賣户因急售而不扳售、買客仍揀高而動、故粳市高定次疲、南路泗涇·靑角等薄稻早稻、銷化不爽、主顧極鮮、祗有零碎交易、行情批别甚足、羊杜秈到源異常凋零、客帮動辦、吃價較寛、但店胃購買挑撰嚴而盤面平、一日之中、不免有角外差次、通變陰元吊飯兩胃轉淡、市况又呆、價格勉守原盤、全日情勢、似乎沉靜、斛脚亦少耳、</p>
<h3>洋米期現均漲</h3>
<p>▲現米漲近角　▲期米漲五六分</p>
<p>昨日洋米雖有到船　然均應解抛貨、市上流通者甚少、而內地鄕莊本街胃口特濃、市面隨見起色、漲起五六分至角許不等、計開出西貢一號一千包、價十四元七角半、又二號一千包、價十三元八角二分、小絞七千包、價十三元三角六分至三角、期米因現貨轉漲、人心愈好、繼因洋行擯不抛售、市形更俏、統市祇有回籠期貨千餘噸、價均上漲五六分云、</p>
<h3>江西機晚新到售開</h3>
<p>江西米因荒歉禁運、久無到貨、市上除江西機元外、亦久未見市、前日始有一批到埠、以機晚爲主、數亦不多、前日到埠時曾約價十五元、昨市始見正式市面、計十四元八角、共祇一百包云</p>
<h3>二月份麫粉交割情形</h3>
<p>▲棧單交進二千包</p>
<p>昨爲二月份交割日、交割額仍極稀少、以阜豐及福新廠、曾有二萬包爲經紀人自行軋去、故交易所正式交割者、聞祗二千包之回籠紅藍車、其餘或廠家收回、或客帮抽去、故遂寂寞如是也、惟昨日洋麥報價又回漲一元左右、恐本月份之標準市面、當又須重人嚴重之境矣、茲將二月份內各月份期貨成交列下、（單位千包）</p>
<p>二月份　　六二六　　四月份一、四二九　六月份　三六一</p>

<p>社會消息</p>
<h3>理想的未來都市</h3>
<p>— 梁雄萬</p>
<p>將來的都市是怎麽樣的、這句話確是很難回答、最近、法國工程師高百歲（M.Le　Corbusies)著了一本書、名叫「理想的未來都市、」那是一本最有價値、直得我們注意的書、書裏對於房屋之建築問題、市民的住宿問題、健康問題等、都有詳細的考慮和計畫、</p>
<p>未來的都市、照高百歲的話說、祗要住三百萬市民就夠了、市的中部是商業區域的中心點、那裏建有許多很高的凌霄房屋、這種建築是非常的新穎、特别的敎人奇異、不論是水飛機·是陸飛機·是體積很大的飛艇·都可以在那房屋的屋頂、隨便停下來、沒有一點障碍和不方便、並且在商業區域的中心點內、建有偉大的飛機總站、裏面可以停着幾十架飛機和飛艇、總站是在馬路的上面、有升降機替他們連絡着、馬路底下、就是火車鐵道　　如今的城市太不行了、你看、差不多百分之六十的地方完全給房屋所佔據、空氣旣是不新鮮、不潔凈、樹木又是寥寥無幾、每座公園的隔離也是極遠得很｜也許亦有離開不遠的、總而言之、以如許多的市民、享受如許少的樹木、照衛生方面講起來、總是於理未合的、所以、高工程師感覺得市內樹木的需要、就建議他理想的凌霄房屋、這樣房子所佔的地方、不過爲全市百分之五、其餘百分之九十五的地方、是用來種樹木花草、開築池塘、是的、我們雖則住在都市中、很需要新鮮潔凈的空氣、正如深在地底下的礦工們一樣的需要、來洗滌我們的胸襟、振作我們疲倦的精神、</p>
<p>他所建議的凌霄房屋是十字形的、這麽一來、一方面可以經濟地方、一方面又可使房子來得更加堅固、屋是平頂的可供飛機及飛艇的停着、屋的正面是鋸（美國女子吕熙忒在巴黎大戲院登臺表演「鐵蹄紅舞」扯中之红舞）</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>形式、像是縱的石級一樣、這樣一來、屋內光線沒有不充足的道理、那十字形的凌霄閣、預定每邊各長四百六十英尺、髙爲七百英尺、可容三萬人、屋的底層爲汽車間、電梯間、再有、馬路的轉角是圓形式的、汽車轉灣的時候、雖是開得很快、却沒有甚麽危險啊、</p>
<h3>紐約消防將以飛機救火</h3>
<p>美國紐約救火會某消防專家、最近宣稱、會中將採用飛機、藉以增强救火能力、最顯著之佳點、乃機身之推進器不在前面而在顶部、故飛起降落時、直上直下、無地狹之苦、非常便利、機中裝有皮帶及抽水機、以及其他應用物件如斧頭·雲梯·化學消防機等物、此外尙可容救火員六七人、或更裝以水上飛機之浮船、則又可停泊水面矣、世界文化日益進步、𤍠閙�</p>
<p>城市、逐漸增多、數十層高之大建築物、街道行人之擁擠、皆使救火汽車不復適用於現代之預防、例如在支加哥·鈕約設有火警發生汽車經𤍠閙之街道而趕往肇事處、旣慢而多危險、且對數十層之高樓、施救更屬困難之事、若有飛機、時間及經濟均可節省、旣抵目的地、只須停於鄰近大樓之屋頂上、即能施救、如屋頂水之供給、爲空氣壓力所不能逹、則可取用機中所備之抽水機、一機之値並不甚昂、而市民之生命財產則安全多矣、（良英）</p>

<h3>三保太監在南洋　　ＹＳ</h3>
<p>（（六）舢板跳和鞋底魚）</p>
<p>這是夜半的時候了、銀色的月亮很幽和地倒影在浩渺的太平洋裏、晚風很温柔地撫摩着太平洋裏互相擁抱的波濤、這時的太平洋是可愛極了的、　　一艘粗大而笨重的「大眼雞」（船名）、領引着六十一艘同樣大小的航船、在浩渺的海洋裏、向着飄渺的南方的島國蕩進、這六十二艘的航船、總共載着二萬七千八百多漢族的兵民、首領是大明的太監鄭和、副首領是王景宏、他們之所以要到南方的島國去、據說是爲了要替大明發揚威風而去的、</p>
<p>一次、正是在這樣的一個月夜、這六十二艘航船上的糧食、快要逹到絕糧的地步了、而南方的島國、依舊和無涯的大海一般地在渺茫裏、於是他們開始發急了、過後不久、他們終於要挨飢忍餓地支持着下去、可是走得和螞蟻一般蠕動的航船、漸漸地遲緩得更利害起來了、後來、終於停泊在浩渺的海洋裏待救了、</p>
<p>這時、三保太監對於他的部下、因爲沒有糧食、又怎能奈他們何呢、他們是爲了忍受不住饑火的冲動、才停頓了進行的、他們幷不是故意和三保太監爲難、這在聰明的三保太監、自然也知道他們的苦衷而能給予原諒的、</p>
<p>這晚的午夜更深、那六十二艘航船裏的飢餓的人們、個個差不多都睡熟了、這時只剩下三保太監和三四個兵民不曾安睡、於是三保太監囑咐他那三四個兵民、預備點奠祭的東西給他祈禱天帝、</p>
<p>「天帝啊、假如是給大明賜福的话、那末這二萬多的大明的兵民、願你不致給他盡行餓死了啊、在這浩渺的海洋裏、我們將能夠得到些什麽食物呢、除了海鮮之外、但這些海鮮、我們那裏能夠捕捉得到呢、因爲這是海洋啊、如果天帝賜福、那末我們便不致於餓死了、海鮮、我們是希望能夠得到當作糧食用的、在不得已的時候、在海洋中、我祈求仁慈的天帝給我們賜下些須來啊」、三保太監這麽祈禱完了之後、在迷離恍惚中、竟不知不覺地沉酣於睡夢中了、</p>
<p>第二天的清晨、三保太監獨自一個人先起來、他看見有不少的魚、從海裏直挑向甲板來、有些在甲板上、還不住地跳躍着、等到他呌醒衆人時、甲板上竟跳滿了魚了、於是他们便不致於絕食了、</p>
<p>「這些魚、爲什麽竟會跳向船上來的呢」、一個兵卒覺得奇異似的這樣說、</p>
<p>「這種是什麽魚呢」、另一個兵卒、向地上拾起一條魚在掌上、呈給三保太監時這樣問、</p>
<p>「我不知道啊、這些是什麽魚」三保太監一面把魚抓住、一面這樣說、</p>
<p>「這種不知名的魚是跳上船來的、我想我們就呌它做舢板跳罷、我們以後如果再遇到這種魚、就這樣呌吧」、三保太監繼續把話說完後、隨即把魚放回地上、誰知這條魚的身上、竟留印着三保太監的指痕五隻、那魚一躍一跳地、却仍舊跳回海裏去了、後來、他們一直就沒有遇到過這種魚了、雖然直到他們到了南國、</p>
<p>然而、這些留印着三保太監的五隻指痕的魚、後人便稱爲五指魚了、（或稱舢板跳）到了現在、漢人是不會買來吃的、至於馬來人是很喜歡吃這種魚的、因爲他們說三保太監會保護他們的</p>
<p>至於鞋底魚呢、却是三保太監弄假成眞的游戲、因爲有一天、他在南國裏逢到了天雨、他穿着一雙粗大的鞋子、泥濘是沾滿了他的雙脚、而他踏進回敎徒跪拜的聖地去、於是聖地被弄汚了、有人對他說</p>
<p>「三保太爺、你看看你的足跡吧、」三保太監回過頭來、看見了自己的足跡、把地方弄汚了、很是不好意思似的、但他爲了自己的面子關係、於是他很乖巧的說、「哈哈、我的脚跡、簡直像一條魚一般的、」他說完後、走了、</p>
<p>第二天、那些泥濘的足跡、竟變成了魚了、當時的那些魚、便是現在南洋華僑所說的鞋底魚了、</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Jin army on the Jinpu Railway, due to Chen Diaoyuan's support for the central government, has decided to concentrate its main force in Dezhou to put pressure on Chen's troops, and has begun to move large units from the Pingjin and Pinghan Railway areas. (28th Electric Communication Society Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yan and Feng Arrive in Taiyuan Together</h3>
<p>(To Proceed to Beiping Soon)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Official sources announced that Yan and Feng arrived in Taiyuan together this morning. Feng is residing at the Fu Gong Ancestral Hall.  Fu, Yan, and Feng will arrive in Beiping before March 10th. Representatives in Taiyuan have repeatedly requested Yan and Feng to immediately come to Beiping to oversee the situation, but Yan has made no firm commitment. (28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fudan News Agency, Taiyuan dispatch: Yan and Feng and their wives arrived in Taiyuan at 12:30 PM on the 28th.

Feng is staying at the Fu Gong Ancestral Hall. Yan hosted a banquet for Feng and his wife at 1 PM. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Headquarters released a Beiping dispatch of the 28th: (1) A certain division commander of the Jin army came to Beiping from Taiyuan and is staying at the Six Nations Hotel. A reporter visited him last night to inquire about the current situation. He said that after the telegram from Bai Chuan to Zheng was sent, representatives from all parties gathered in Taiyuan, all willing to serve. Bai then ordered mobilization and issued over 5 million yuan in military expenses to the Northwest Army and various other miscellaneous armies in Henan. However, there has been no effect in the past half month. Apart from a portion of the Jin army mobilizing, the rest remain inactive. Bai's intentions are unlikely to materialize. (2) Northeastern generals are very dissatisfied with Yan's use of force. All believe that China has suffered from years of internal war, endlessly cycling, leaving the people impoverished and resources depleted, with widespread suffering. Military force should not be used again, and with strong neighbors to the east and west constantly applying pressure, it is even more unacceptable to engage in internal strife. It is said that they plan to send a telegram to the Jin side to correct them. (3) Yan's close associates are full of feudal ideas and there is talk of uniting with the Anfu clique to urge Yan to quickly form a government in Beiping. (4) The two factions of the Western Hills Reorganization group are exploiting each other, and the political situation in the Jin region is in a state of chaos. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ye Kaixin's Troops Under Command of the Second Route Army</h3>

(28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shen Yinmo advocates that the Huabei Ribao should continue to be published, but with less coverage of current affairs news. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Generals from Various Sides Telegram Jiang, Denying Listing on the Yang Telegram</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Generals from various sides have been sending telegrams to Jiang in recent days, declaring that their names were falsely listed on Yan's Yang Telegram. He Jian's telegram stated, "Received your instructions and am shocked beyond words. I have dedicated myself to the Party and the nation, and only know to protect the central government, consolidate unity, achieve genuine peace, and complete the revolutionary mission. With clear right and wrong and disregard for personal gain, I believe you understand my humble heart. How could I possibly co-sign such a telegram? Although I have not yet received the telegram in question, I have already sent a telegram to severely question it and another to deny it." Liu Zhennian's telegram stated, "Received your instructions regarding the Yang Telegram from the Jin side, which includes my name, and am shocked and terrified after reading it. I am deeply grateful for the central government's trust and your special understanding. I only regret that I have not repaid your kindness and deeply ashamed of myself. How could I possibly blindly agree and bring blame upon myself? This is clearly the work of malicious people trying to sow discord. In addition to sending a telegram to Jin to inquire about the matter, I respectfully submit this." Yang Hucheng's telegram stated, "I have always regarded Yan as cunning and have not dared to casually exchange documents or telegrams with him. Last year, during the campaign against Tang, I replied once due to his joint telegram with Commander Zhang from Fengtian, supporting the central government. Unexpectedly, he specially dispatched his staff officer, Yan Zhiyuan, to the Zhumaidian on the 13th. I received a report from the front and immediately sternly refused to let him come to Wancheng and asked him to go north. I kept a copy of the secret telegram he brought with him, as well as a draft of a telegram that Yan intended to send. I summarized the key points and reported them in a separate telegram. Now, at 10 PM, I received two telegrams from Sun Chu in Zhengzhou, whose wording is disjointed and even more astonishing. I have transcribed the original text below. The first one reads, 'Commander Yang Hucheng, best wishes. City secret, I have received your telegram. The headquarters opened the telegram in which you are speaking of; Yang Hucheng's troops should immediately move to the east of the railway and report on a daily basis. In the future, they will be the reserve army for the Longhai front. As for the Northwest Army, since our goals are the same, we will take full responsibility here and have no worries. Please convey this to reassure him, my brother, Sun Chu.' The second telegram reads, 'Commander Yang Hucheng, best wishes. City secret, the Northwest Army will join us in launching an expedition and fighting together. Let me reiterate that the army will only pass through the east and will not be stationed in Henan. Our goals are the same and we are all friendly forces. Please dispel any doubts. When should we mobilize? Please reply, my brother, Sun Chu.' These are extremely treacherous words designed to provoke and sow discord. I replied to the telegram and informed the governor." (28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Wenhui and Jin Shuren both sent telegrams denying that they were listed on Yan's and others' Yang Telegram. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Advances to Nanjing from Hankou</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Chen Cheng flew to Nanjing from Hankou on the morning of the 28th to report important matters to Jiang. Deputy Division Commander Luo Zhuoying will also go to Nanjing within days. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ma Fuxiang Resigns from Anhui Governorship</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Fuxiang, due to his ongoing illness, has submitted his resignation from the governorship of Anhui Province. It is said that the central government has decided to issue an official order to persuade him to stay. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nepalese Crown Prince Leads Troops to Invade Tibet</h3>
<p>(Dalai Lama Telegrams Nanjing Requesting Troops to Defend the Border)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to sources from the Panchen Lama's Office in Nanjing, the King of Nepal, instigated by the ruler of Gorkha, has dispatched over 60,000 troops led by Crown Prince Babu Semto, stationed in areas such as Yasha, Gyirong, Kulung, Yanglong, and Wulongdun, advancing towards Tibet from Enkeli. The Dalai Lama has telegraphed Nanjing requesting three divisions of troops to defend the border. The Panchen Lama, with Tibet being directly affected, also requests the central government to provide military assistance to cope with the situation. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Domestic Important Telegrams II</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The New Era Diplomacy of the Japanese Cabinet Towards China</h3>
<p>After winning the election, the Ri Nei Cabinet, through Hamaguchi and Shidehara, has expressed a diplomatic policy towards China, advocating a reversal of the out-of-date and reactionary policies of the Tanaka Cabinet, and replacing them with a stable and solid new era of diplomacy. The comments in the Japanese newspapers are mostly supportive and urging. The Tokyo Asahi said it was a good opportunity to refresh diplomacy. The Hochi Shimbun said that diplomacy towards China should not emulate the previous cabinet's haste for quick results, and should require extra care. The Commercial News said that the current cabinet should make good use of this opportunity and strive to open a new page. The Jiji Shinpo said that since the basis of Shidehara's diplomacy has been established, the previous unease can be swept away, and it is hoped that it will be further strengthened. That is, Japanese public opinion is also unanimously supporting the success of the authorities in refreshing the policy. But if only the appearance is refreshed, without refreshing the fundamental advocacy, I am afraid that it will still be of no use to the facts.</p>
<p>The failure of the Seiyukai in this election was indeed due to the fact that the people disliked Tanaka's arbitrary policy. Tanaka's arbitrary policy not only made domestic politics increasingly corrupt, principles and disciplines gradually slackened, and the economy fell into poverty, but also his ambition for aggression against China became increasingly urgent. All kinds of actions only provoked the anger of our people, affecting Sino-Japanese trade, so the Japanese people are also very dissatisfied. This is indeed the true cause of Seiyukai's failure. Today, since the cabinet has realized this, it should vigorously remove the fundamental errors of the previous cabinet, abandon the various rights acquired by illegal means in China that are criticized by the world, and replace them with a spirit of equal mutual assistance and sincere policy. This can be called refreshing diplomacy, which is in line with the so-called method of new era diplomacy. If we merely abandon the previous cabinet's policy of military aggression and replace it with soft methods, while on the one hand still adhering to its traditional and consistent policies, on the other hand trying to find a way to refresh in terms of methods, I am afraid that it will eventually be impossible. Otherwise, Shidehara's diplomatic policy, which states that it will improve Sino-Japanese international relations, that China and Japan will coexist and prosper together, and that it will strive to enhance the friendship between China and Japan, has already been repeatedly stated. Why are the Chinese people indifferent to these expressions and instead suspect that Shidehara's diplomacy is hypocritical and empty? This is what the Ri Nei Cabinet should calmly and quietly consider, so as to show our people the reality of new era diplomacy.</p>

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Decides to Convene the Imperial Diet</h3>
<p>(To be convened in Tokyo on April 21st)</p>
<p>(Edict to be promulgated in the Official Gazette after Imperial sanction)</p>
<p>▲ Rengo News Agency Tokyo, 28th - Today's regular cabinet meeting formally decided to convene the 58th Imperial Diet on April 21st, for a term of three weeks. It was immediately submitted for Imperial sanction and will be promulgated in the Official Gazette on March 1st.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency Tokyo, 28th - The convening of a special session of the Diet was formally decided at today's regular cabinet meeting. After the Emperor returns, his sanction will be obtained, and the edict will be promulgated in the Official Gazette on the 1st. There will be two edicts: (1) "I, in accordance with Article 7 and Article 45 of the Imperial Constitution, convene the Imperial Diet in Tokyo on April 21st of this year."

The government and the party declared that this was the nation's trust in the current government and that there would be absolutely no suppression or interference. However, according to reports from various quarters, the government used extremely clever means to interfere, which was extremely obvious. A portion of the House of Peers, greatly dissatisfied, and its Koyu Club, which rushed to the front, held a general meeting during the election, dispatching Hanai Takuzo, Kawamura Takeji, Minami Hiroshi, and others to various places to conduct detailed investigations. They drafted a detailed report on the results and submitted it to the general meeting on March 1st, then mailed it to various locations to arouse public opinion and to list the facts of interference in the special Diet to attack the government.</p>
<h3>Spain - Political Turmoil Has Not Yet Subsided</h3>
<p>(Dr. Gurla's Speech Causes Disturbance)</p>
<p>(Crowds Chant "Down with the Empire" During Marches)</p>
<p>▲ Reuters Madrid, 27th - Dr. Gurla, formerly affiliated with the Conservative Party and a former Prime Minister, gave a speech at a large theater here today, strongly attacking King Alfonso XIII of Spain. He said, "The King is no longer trusted by the people. I am not a Republican, but I recognize that if the people want a democratic country, they should have it." Dr. Gurla severely criticized former General Duke de Rivera, saying that Rivera was the King's puppet and that the responsibility of each person must be investigated by legal means. The atmosphere at the meeting was very intense. Attendees paid a fee for their seats, approximately one pound sterling. While Dr. Gurla was speaking at the meeting, crowds outside the door scrambled to enter, shouting "Down with the King." The situation became dire, and the police used knives to disperse the crowds, while some cavalry also engaged in pursuit. In the confusion, many people were seriously injured. The people all believe that the King is truly guilty of the unfortunate war in Morocco in previous years and of General Rivera's wielding of dictatorial power thereafter. At present, the general sentiment is very inclined towards republicanism. However, whether the Republicans have sufficient organization today to take concerted action to overthrow the empire is still a question.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters Madrid, 28th - Last night, after Dr. Gurla's speech, 30,000 people, mostly students, carrying flags, marched in formation through the streets, shouting "Long live the Republic!" and "Down with the Empire!" The police tried to seize the crowds' flags, leading to clashes. Several teams of women from the Catholic League distributed leaflets in the crowd praising the King and the Cabinet. During the disturbances, many shops closed their doors to prevent accidents, but the whole city returned to calm by night.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency Madrid, 27th - In the Vix region near Barcelona, a large number of rioters attempted to break into the Rivera branch of the Patriotic Party of Half-Pints. The police tried to prevent them but were ignored, so they opened fire on the crowd, killing two people and injuring many more. Although this matter is small, it shows that after the situation in Spain had calmed down slightly, the reorganization of municipal governments in various regions and the granting of opportunities to Republicans in the countryside to promote the overthrow of the monarchy have once again made the national situation increasingly tense.</p>
<h3>Naval Conference Situation Chaotic</h3>
<p>(Japan-U.S. Negotiations Make No Progress)</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency London, 27th - The U.S. delegation held a plenary meeting at the Ritz Hotel this morning to discuss the Japan-U.S. negotiation issues. Subsequently, U.S. delegate Li Da went to the Japanese Embassy at 11:30 a.m. to visit delegate Matsudaira, and the meeting lasted about 40 minutes. It involved the presentation of some numerical corrections to ease the differences of opinion between Japan and the U.S. Delegate Matsudaira questioned two or three points of doubt, and the content was not a new proposal. After meeting with Mr. Li, Delegate Matsudaira visited Delegates Wakatsuki and Zaibu at 1 p.m. to report on the content of the meeting and to discuss countermeasures. Delegates Wakatsuki and Zaibu said to people about this matter, "This kind of meeting is not rare, and there is no new development to speak of." Regarding the content, they kept silent. It is reported that the proposal from the U.S. side today has not yet reached the level of satisfying Japan and is only a slight revision of the original U.S. plan, which is a proposal to guide compromise. However, general observation is that the Japan-U.S. negotiations have entered the second stage from now on, so it is regarded as very important. Delegate Wakatsuki stated clearly during the first negotiation that if 70% of Japan's requirements are not met, no matter what proposal is made, it will not be agreed to. Therefore, it is feared that it is impossible to ease the opinions of the two parties by merely seeking harmony in numbers. However, Japan does not oppose considering alternative proposals at the appropriate time within the scope of not exceeding the scope of requirements.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters London, 27th - Labor Party's Mandell asked the government in the House of Commons today whether the government's policy was to dismantle battleships to the greatest possible extent under the international naval agreement. The British Prime Minister replied that the British policy was already contained in the memorandum issued on February 7th and did not need to be repeated. Labor Party's Gan Weishi asked whether the words in the memorandum, hoping that battleships would be eliminated in the future, were the policy of the British delegation to the naval conference. The Prime Minister replied that this was the policy of the British government and that this was the goal that must be achieved through international agreements. The number of reductions in Britain depends on how other countries reduce them. Even reducing one pound more is not possible. The government sincerely hopes to conclude an international agreement to reduce the navy.</p>
<p>[Domingo's Situation is Bleak]</p>

Rumors spread for a time, saying that if President Vasquez did not resign again, the revolutionary army would bombard the presidential palace.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency Washington, 27th - The American, Cotes, stationed in Domingo, telegraphed the State Department today, stating that the Domingo government side had signed a truce with the leader of the revolutionary army occupying the capital in order to avoid bloodshed, so that both sides could negotiate peacefully to resolve the situation.

If Mr. Tedeschi resigns, it is expected that the French President will persuade Poincaré to take the helm again.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates Coal Mining Bill</h3>
<p>(The Liberal Party's Amendment is Defeated)</p>
<p>▲ Reuters London, 27th - The House of Commons debated the Coal Mining Bill today, and members of each party attended in full force at the call of their party leaders. The debate focused on the amendment proposed by the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party wanted to leave only the sales plan in the first part of the bill and delete the issue of production. In other words, it would obliterate the government's proposal to restrict production, which it considered the most important part of the bill. The result of the vote was that the Liberal Party's amendment was defeated by 280 votes to 271 votes. Several Liberal Party members who opposed party leader George did not vote. The government was able to preserve it. After the results of the party vote were announced, Labor Party members stood up and cheered. Those who voted for the government were 270 from the Labor Party, 4 from the Liberal Party, 4 from the independent faction, and 2 from the Irish Nationalist Party. Those who opposed it were 228 from the Conservative Party, 42 from the Liberal Party, and 1 from the independent faction. After the event, Cook, secretary of the Miners' Federation, spoke on behalf of the miners, saying that if Liberal Party leader George defeated the government, work in the country's coal mining areas would be completely halted. The Miners' Federation now knows that the Liberal Party's so-called sympathy for the miners is all a deceptive claim. George's actions tonight will cause the Miners' Federation and the Labor Party to use all their strength to oppose liberalism.</p>
<h3>Taft's Illness Shows No Improvement</h3>

<h3>New Endeavors in the British Shipbuilding Industry</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters London, 27th - In order to eliminate obsolete shipyards, concentrate shipbuilding operations, and seek economic savings, the British shipbuilding industry has now organized a company and applied for registration. Its name is National Shipyard Security Co., Ltd., with a capital of £10,000, but with the ability to borrow up to £3 million. The purpose of the new company is to buy up surplus or obsolete shipyards, dispose of their machinery, and resell their sites for other business purposes. This company is sponsored by most of the famous British shipyards, but it is not a merger. According to the declaration of the new company, the position of the British shipbuilding industry has gradually become stable in the past two years and can cope with foreign competition. Half of the world's tonnage is now contracted by Britain. However, the difficulties of reducing the shipbuilding industry due to the reduction of warships are likely to increase year by year. Although many shipyards have closed down in recent years, there are still too many shipyards. The elimination of surplus shipyards will not only not increase unemployment but also increase employment, because the existing shipyards are more able to engage in world competition.</p>

<h3>Indian Government Plans to Levy New Taxes</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters New Delhi, 26th - Sir Hirsted, the Finance Member of the Indian government, submitted a very important budget proposal in Parliament today, proposing to levy new taxes so that the Indian government can fund large-scale reforms in various provinces. The new taxes include an increase in the cotton fabric tax from 11% to 15%, and a protection tax of 5% on non-British cotton goods for a period of three years. In addition, a tax of four pence per ounce is levied on silver bullion, but the tax levied can be fully refunded for exported silver. In total, various new taxes can make the budget surplus 7 million rupees, and it is expected that 230 million rupees will still need to be raised in India, of which 74 million will be new currency.</p>
<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>● Telegram from Nanjing - For the attention of all newspapers: We have just learned that Yan Xishan and others' telegrams include the name of our province's chairman, Mao Guangxiang, which is extremely surprising. It has been found that our province has always adhered to the central government as its duty and has never wavered. It has had no relationship with Yan and others at all. Since Yan and others sent out the telegram, our province's chairman has also repeatedly telegraphed Chairman Chiang, expressing his determination and obedience to the central government. Yan and others' telegrams are purely misappropriation of names and contain the intention of sowing discord. In addition to telegraphing our chairman to deny it immediately, we hereby send a telegram to clarify matters in advance to avoid confusing the public. We respectfully request your investigation. Qian Representatives Xiong Yibin and Tan Xingge respectfully inquire and stamp.</p>
<p>● Telegram from the Nanjing Central News Agency - For the attention of all newspapers: Our agency's Peiping branch has recently been destroyed by reactionary forces and has lost its freedom. Hereafter, all news items sent by that branch, which are fabricated by reactionary forces, should not be used. The Central News Agency respectfully inquires.</p>

<h3>Case of Overseas Chinese Obtaining Return Permits to the United States</h3>
<p>▲ Has been resolved through negotiations by Ambassador Wu stationed in the United States</p>
<p>Since the U.S. government promulgated the new immigration law in 1924, the Immigration Bureau has refused to grant return permits to foreigners who came to the U.S. with merchant status after July 1st of that year when they returned to their home countries due to business. Although this is a general practice to restrict foreigners from entering, other foreigners can naturalize as U.S. citizens, while overseas Chinese cannot. Overseas Chinese are the most affected by this law. Moreover, because they cannot come and go freely, they do not dare to invest as much as possible. For several years, there has not been much development in the business of overseas Chinese in the U.S., which is also one of the reasons. After Dr. Wu Chaoshu was sent to the U.S. as an envoy last year, he followed the demands of the overseas Chinese, cited public reason, and officially negotiated with the U.S. Department of State. More than half a year passed until October 31st, when the U.S. Department of State approved a reply stating that according to the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Industry on September 20th of this year, any Chinese merchant who has obtained the qualifications to enter the U.S. in accordance with Article 3, Section 6 of the 1924 Immigration Law may submit a petition when leaving the U.S. to obtain the qualifications to return to the U.S., and request the competent official to certify it. Before returning to the U.S., they should send it to the nearest U.S. resident official for visa, and then they can re-enter the U.S. Therefore, this case has a satisfactory result. Ambassador Wu has now notified all consuls to inform various overseas Chinese organizations and has telegraphed the Department of State to report the situation of the negotiations.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Health Promotes Domestic Medicinal Materials</h3>
<p>▲ Seeking Land to Plant Castor Seeds</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health is sparing no effort to promote domestic pharmaceuticals. Recently, among Western medicines, castor oil, which is the most widely used and has obvious effects, was originally produced in our country, but because we do not know how to refine it precisely, it is not suitable for medicinal use. It is now planned to purchase land in Xiaozhuang and plant it ourselves, and then refine it scientifically for medicinal use. It has already been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The memorandum is recorded as follows: "We believe that our country's domestic medicinal materials have a wide variety, but they are only mired in the Materia Medica and do not conduct research. So far, they still maintain their natural and primitive state. In recent years, countries such as Germany, the United States, Britain, and Japan have devoted themselves to the research of Chinese medicine. The raw materials taken are made into new drugs using scientific methods, such as "Emetine" and "Iodoform," which are mostly invented from ephedra and angelica. Our country's profit rights are lost to foreign countries, and the losses are incalculable. We should pay special attention to medical research and the future of domestic products. Now, in order to find ways to promote and recover profit rights, we plan to select castor seeds, which are the most widely used and have obvious effects, and first select 80 mu of land near Xiaozhuang outside the capital for planting and trial planting. It is estimated that the cost of opening and planting will be about 5,304 yuan in total. At the beginning of the establishment of the Ministry, the affairs were relatively simple, and the number of staff was also small. All expenditures were made to seek frugality as much as possible, and the remaining funds were immediately stored in special accounts. A considerable amount has now been accumulated. It is proposed to allocate this amount of money for the trial planting of castor seeds from the remaining funds without submitting a separate request for money. All the silver allocated will be reported on a special case basis at the end of the year to show the verification and value public funds. Is this appropriate? We should prepare a budget, submit a document, and request your review and instruction for implementation." (Daily News)</p>
<h3>Hunanese Residents in Beijing Gather to Raise Disaster Relief Funds</h3>
<p>▲ Disaster Relief Funds Have Been Exhausted, but the Calamity Has Not Abated</p>
<p>▲ Spring Famine is Urgent, and Relief is Especially Desired</p>
<p>The severity of the disaster in Hunan has been reported repeatedly in previous newspapers. Since the province established a provincial disaster relief association in May last year, it has distributed approximately 1.2 million yuan in disaster relief funds. In addition to receiving 350,000 yuan in central disaster relief bonds, which were converted into more than 250,000 yuan, the rest was raised within the province. At the moment, the province has exhausted its resources, the calamity has not abated, and the ice and snow disasters it suffered last winter were very serious, making the spring famine extremely urgent. Therefore, Shu Jingxiang was sent to Beijing and Shanghai to seek disaster relief and raise donations. He arrived in Beijing the other day, and Ma Linyi and Shu Guangbao, representatives of the provincial disaster relief association stationed in Beijing, held a banquet for fellow Hunanese residents in Beijing at Taoyedu Lao Baoxin to discuss ways to proceed. First, Representatives Ma and Shu delivered speeches, followed by Commissioner Shu, who described the disaster situation and the progress of disaster relief. Subsequently, Qiu Ao, Peng Guojun, Ye Kaixin, Chen Yu, and others proposed to publicly elect Ye Kaixin, Qiu Ao, Chen Yu, Ma Linyi, Shu Guangbao, and Shu Jingxiang to first visit President Tan to discuss and finalize a plan, and then schedule visits to President Chiang and various courts, ministries, commissions, and departments to raise disaster relief funds. Later, Tang Shoulin proposed holding a charity performance, saying that he had obtained the consent of Ouyang Yuqian and others, and that both Beijing and Shanghai would provide support.</p>

<h3>He Jian Reports: Communist Party's Sabotage Plan for Changde and Li County</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, after discovering the Communist Party's plan to disrupt the Xiangxi (Western Hunan), Changde and Li County areas, in addition to ordering Dai Douyuan, Chen Hanzhang, Chen Quzhen and other troops currently stationed in Xiangxi to take strict precautions, has also instructed them to thoroughly eliminate the Communist bandits He Long, Zhou Chaowu, etc., as soon as possible, in order to remove the Communist Party's reliance. On the other hand, yesterday, he convened people from all walks of life in the party, government, and military at the Zhongshan Hall to publicly report on the Communist Party's conspiracy, stating that the Communist Party is currently trying to carry out sabotage in the Changde and Li County area of Xiangxi. Their method consists of nine points. They infiltrate various local Kuomintang or mass organizations with a gray attitude to carry out Communist work. The Communist Party, having established the above sabotage strategy, gloats and begins in Xiangxi's Changde and Li County. The Communist Party also clearly told the Xiangxi Communist Party that the central government has revealed four conditions for the location where the riot should be held: (1) Important transportation routes (such as waterways, railways, and cities), (2) Non-red areas, (3) Places where the ruling class is increasingly shaken, and (4) Places where mass struggles have a foundation. Now that the rule in Hunan is shaken, according to this principle, you should undoubtedly develop towards Changde and Li County on the one hand, and contact the Red Army in western Hubei to develop towards the lower reaches of the Yangtze River on the other hand, and never take the past approach of retreating to Shihe, Sangzhi. From this observation, it can be seen that the Communist Party's future work must be in places with convenient transportation and where banditry has not been quelled. Comrades, we must all pay special attention to peace and order, especially the defense of Changde and Li County must be extraordinarily meticulous. Recently, bandit alarms have been heard from time to time in counties bordering Hubei and Jiangxi provinces in Hunan, which is the Communist Party implementing its sabotage plan and wantonly rioting. Therefore, today, I am taking this opportunity to report the Communist Party's sabotage plan in summary so that everyone knows and rises up together to defend against it and eliminate it. In short, as long as the comrades responsible for the security of Hunan in the party, government, and military can work together to clear and suppress bandits, the local area of Hunan will surely be consolidated. If Hunan is consolidated, then the two lakes will be stable. If the two lakes are stable, then the central government will get a great guarantee. After finishing the speech, the meeting dispersed.

<h3>Hebei Provincial Government's Plan to Repair the Luan River</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence, 24th: The Luan River has flooded and caused disasters for many years, and the losses are immeasurable. Wen Shouquan, Director of the Hebei Construction Department, recently, at the request of the North China Water Conservancy Commission, specifically presented a concrete plan for repairing the Luan River for discussion at the provincial government's routine meeting. It was resolved "to order the county to raise funds for implementation." The details of the plan are recorded below:</p>
<p>"The Luan River comes from the Rehe province area, passes through a long mountain gorge, and converges various springs and streams. It only emerges from the mountains into the plains at Pianliangting in Luan County. The Beining Railway Bridge is built here. The river channel suddenly widens. Every time during the flood season, the water勢勢溢濫滥, destroying villages and collapsing banks, and often causing huge disasters. It is estimated that there have been six major floods from the ninth year of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty to last summer. Thousands of villages have been affected, especially the east bank of Luan County is the most dangerous. According to the investigation, the river used to be more than five miles east of Luan County, but it has shifted westward several times, destroying Shenzhuangzi, Mengguanying, Gangshangzi, Liuzhazi, Zhuzhuangzi, Liuzhuangzi and other villages, as well as Dongguan and Nanchang, one after another. All of them have been reduced to rubble. Now it is approaching the city walls, only about 150 meters away, and the shape of the river bank curves inward like the back of a bow. After another major flood, the bank will gradually collapse, and Luan County will also be in imminent danger. Protection works should be implemented as soon as possible and brook no delay. Three preliminary plans are proposed as follows: (1) Bank Protection Plan: Build a stone revetment along the right bank from the Beining Railway Bridge to the southern end of Luan City County, a total length of 3 kilometers and 650 meters, estimated to cost 96,000 yuan. (2) Bank Protection and Embankment Plan: From the Beining Railway Bridge to the southern end of Luan County, in addition to building the stone revetment of the first plan, build an earthen embankment along the same slope, about 2.5 meters high, and pave the water-facing slope with rubble to form the same slope as the bank protection, for a total length of 3 kilometers and 650 meters. In addition, extend an earthen embankment southward from the end of this embankment and connect it to the foot of Yanshan Mountain, about 2 kilometers long, estimated to cost 135,000 yuan. (3) Restore the Old Channel of the River: Excavate a diversion channel along the old channel of the Luan River, with a bottom width of 35 meters and a length of about 4 kilometers, and build a stone dam bank and a weir dam on the right bank under the railway bridge, estimated to cost 165,500 yuan. The above three plans were submitted by the Chief of Technology to the Seventh Committee, which resolved to refer to the first and third plans, reduce the width of the diversion channel, build three low stone dams, and the Dongguan bank protection project, and formulate a plan to be implemented in two phases. The first phase of the project is divided into three parts: (A) Excavation of the diversion channel, (B) Construction of stone dam bank and stone weir dam, (C) Construction of stone dam bank and stone revetment. (A) Excavation of the diversion channel: According to the investigation, the Luan River channel downstream of the railway bridge has shifted westward since the ninth year of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty and is now approaching the county seat. If the flood in the river continues to flow along the right bank, it is not a fundamental solution, and the cost of annual repairs may be considerable. It is now proposed to excavate a diversion channel along the old channel of the river, starting from the center of the Luan River channel downstream of the railway bridge, about 6 kilometers long. The downstream end is connected to the current river channel. The slope of the river channel is 1/4000. The width of the river bottom is 30 meters. When the water depth at low water level is 1 meter, the flow velocity is 6 decimeters per second, and the flow rate is about 22 cubic meters per second. If the water level continues to rise, when the water surface reaches the top of the first weir dam (the top of the first weir dam is 23 meters above the Dagukou Datum), the water depth is 2.75 meters, the flow velocity is about 1 meter per second, and the flow rate is about 100 cubic meters per second. The main purpose of this plan is to guide the river into the new channel during low water levels and small floods, and to gradually expand the new channel by the scouring force of the water, so that the middle flood during large floods will have a tendency to restore the old channel. Judging from the shape of the new diversion channel, the momentum is very smooth when pouring down, which is the function of this diversion channel. (B) Constructing stone embankment and stacking stone weir坝坝, the current river channel is closer to the right bank, as mentioned above, then to manage this section of the river channel to gradually return to the old channel, in addition to excavating a new diversion channel, a weir坝坝 must be built to guide the water into the new river, so that the river channel along the right bank is blocked by the weir坝坝, gradually silted up, so as to achieve the purpose of restoring the old channel. The planned first stone dam bank and the first weir坝坝 are located on the right bank about 150 meters below the railway bridge, and a stone revetment is built there to connect with the stone paving of the wings of the railway bridge. The height of the stone dam bridge is the same as the bank, the stone weir坝坝 is 580 meters long, and forms a 26-degree angle with the right bank line. The top of the坝坝 is about 1.7 meters above the low water level (the height of the坝坝 is 23 meters), and the top of the坝坝 is 5 meters wide. (C) Build Dongguan stone embankment and pave stone revetment: Dongguan in the county town is only more than 100 meters away from the river bank, and the river bank curves inward. Every time there is a flood, it collapses inward, gradually approaching the city wall. The protection of this section of the river bank is particularly important. It is planned to build a stone embankment and pave stone revetment for about 1 kilometer and 400 meters. The main purpose of this project is to take into account the intention of protecting the embankment while restoring the old channel. The second project is divided into two parts: (A) The second stone dam bank is stacked with石堰坝,(B) the third堰坝. (A) The second stone dam bank, planned to be built on the right bank about 1.3 kilometers downstream of the railway bridge, the orientation of the堰坝forms a 45-degree angle with the right bank, the height of the dam is 22.5 meters, the length of the dam is 200 meters, and its top width and upstream and downstream slopes are the same as the first堰坝. (B) The third坝坝, that is, the third stone坝坝is continuously built to form a 45-degree angle with the river bank line, the length is 250 meters, the height of the dam top is 22.3 meters, and its top width and upstream and downstream slopes are the same as the first and second坝坝. The purpose of the second phase of the project is to slow down the river along the right bank to gradually accumulate silt. In the future, when the silt becomes thicker, the堰坝can be increased year by year, so that the river bank outside Dongguan will gradually move eastward. This is the main idea of the protection project."</p>
<h3>Military Ranch in Northeast China</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The world's finest horse breeds are only the Arabian and Italian breeds. Secondly, the Mongolian horse is able to endure hardship and is good at galloping, and is also one of the world's famous products. Mongolian horses are roughly divided into three types: Wu Zhu, Mu Qin, and Darhan, with those produced by Wu Zhu Mu Qin being the most famous. Not only are they in good physical condition, strong and healthy, but they are also rich in endurance and resistance to epidemics. It is regrettable that the Chinese people have never paid attention to eugenics, allowing the wrong species to spread, and after several generations, they gradually degenerate. The trunk and strength of the horse have the disadvantages of being short and weak. Zhang Xueliang attached great importance to the improvement of horse breeds and animal husbandry. When Wu Junsheng, the current military governor of Heilongjiang, died of illness, he left a Liaoyuan ranch with about a thousand good horses. Zhang bought them at a high price. In the winter of the 17th year of the Republic of China, he commissioned Jin Jingqing, the former artillery brigade commander, as the general manager of the military ranch. The office was initially established in the Shengyuan Industrial Zone, and then moved to Liaoyuan. In the autumn of the 18th year, 47 purebred Orlov horses were purchased for breeding and improvement purposes. The initial plan was to improve military horses, and then extend it to civilian horses throughout the province. Later, due to the insufficient application of the ranch, the office was moved to Taonan County in September of the 18th year, and the horses were moved to Ge Gengen for grazing. The investigation of the situation of the ranch is as follows: (1) Affiliation: The ranch is directly under the Northeast Border Defense Commander-in-Chief's Office and is temporarily under the guidance of the Xing'an District Reclamation Supervisory Office. (2) Organization: Below the general manager, there is one field affairs director, two sections for general affairs and animal husbandry, each with one section chief, five section members, eight clerks, and one department head and two technicians in the technical department. (3) Expenses: Regular expenses are 5,000 yuan per month, and start-up expenses are about 100,000 yuan, all of which are allocated by the Border Defense Office. (4) Types and number of horses: 1. More than 550 Chinese horses, worth more than 60,000 yuan, are produced in various places in Mongolia, East and West Wu Zhu Mu Qin. 2. Foreign horses, in August of the 18th year, 47 Aloroff breeding horses were purchased from the Hailar Russian Wolun Cuofu brothers ranch for 50,000 yuan. (5) Breeding situation in the first year: Chinese horses gave birth to more than 300 new foals. When foreign horses were purchased, they were already past the breeding period, so they were not mated. (6) Grazing method: The Xing'an area is vast, and wild grass is lush in summer and autumn, which is most suitable for wild grazing. At this time, pure grazing is the main method. The horses of the whole ranch are divided into six groups and grazed separately. They drink clear spring water every day. In winter and spring, when frost falls and grass withers, it is not suitable for grazing. At this time, pure feeding is the best. The horses of the whole ranch are fed together. All the feed is cut in the autumn by recruiting workers to prepare for winter and spring. The usual feed is fixed in quantity, but the breeding horses and the mares with foals are given extra feed and washed and exercised daily to develop their bodies. (7) Construction of horse stables: In September of the 18th year, more than 70 rooms were built outside the west gate of Taonan City, specially for the needs of foreign horse breeds. It was also approved to build horse stables near Gongzhuling for the needs of Chinese horses. It will be completed this year. (8) Types and prevention of diseases: Horses are prone to horse ticks due to grazing. There is a very effective medicine for treatment, so there is no hindrance. When the young foals are first born, they are easily affected by damp and cold because there is no protection from the horse stable, which can easily lead to dysentery and low back pain. Mares who give birth to foals are also often affected by this disease. Once treated, it is not very serious. This year, when the horse stable is built, vomiting can be avoided. For other diseases, the method of isolation is mostly used to prevent infection. (9) Suitability of the ranch: The Gongzhuling area is about ten miles wide between the two hills and about thirty miles long. The pasture is fertile, the drinking water is clean, the transportation is convenient, the location is high and cool, and the terrain is generally flat. There is no flood damage in summer, and there is a natural boundary with civilian ranches, but it is slightly narrow. If animal husbandry develops gradually and is not enough to use, a suitable location will be selected for relocation in the future. (10) Subsidiary animal husbandry business: In addition to horses, the ranch also has cattle, sheep and camels in small numbers, which are also prepared for breeding and improvement purposes.</p>
<h3>The Liaoning Provincial Department of Civil Affairs Plans to Expand the General Refugee Relief Office</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: In recent years, domestic wars have been frequent, and natural disasters have occurred one after another. In several provinces of the Central Plains, the fields are desolate for thousands of miles, and the people cannot make a living. Millions have come to the three northeastern provinces to reclaim wasteland and seek food. To facilitate these struggling compatriots from the east, Liaoning has established a General Refugee Relief Office of Zhili and Shandong, providing assistance at any time. Initially, most of those arriving were from Zhili and Shandong, but recently, refugees from Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Shanxi, and Zhejiang provinces have also followed one after another. As the number of people has increased, the office's affairs have become increasingly complex, and it is struggling to cope. Previously, an application was submitted to the Liaoning Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to expand the organization and change its name. The Department of Civil Affairs forwarded the request to the provincial government, which sent personnel to investigate the situation of the office. The provincial chairman then submitted it to the 77th Provincial Committee meeting, which was handed over to the Department of Civil Affairs to formulate a proper plan. The plan was approved. The five measures formulated by the Department of Civil Affairs, in accordance with the order reported to the provincial government, for the refugee relief office are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Change of Name: The General Office previously only provided relief to refugees from Zhili and Shandong, hence the use of the names of these two provinces. Last year, when refugees from Henan Province came east, they were also provided with relief. The name is no longer appropriate. Recently, it has been heard that disasters have occurred frequently in various provinces of the interior. Those arriving this spring may not be limited to these provinces. It is proposed to change the name to the Liaoning General Refugee Relief Office to be more inclusive.</p>
<p>(2) Change of Organization: The office was previously jointly organized by four legal entities: the Provincial Assembly, the General Chamber of Commerce, the Education Association, and the Agricultural Association. Various agencies, including the Diplomatic Office, the Police Department, the Police Bureau, the Commercial Port Police Bureau, the Municipal Government, the Tongshantang, and the Shenyang County, assisted in handling affairs. Now that the Provincial Assembly has been abolished and the Agricultural Association has been reorganized but not yet established, and the General Chamber of Commerce has been changed to the General Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Provincial Assembly and the Agricultural Association should be removed. The General Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Education Association, and the Liaoning branch of the International Red Cross Society should be added, still forming a joint organization of four legal entities. As for the assisting agencies, it is proposed to add the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance, along with the originally designated agencies, to facilitate implementation.</p>
<p>(3) Expansion of Address: The general office is attached to the General Chamber of Commerce, with only one room. When representatives from other provinces come for negotiations, it is not enough for reception. It is proposed that the Chamber of Commerce allocate several rooms for office use.</p>
<p>(4) Establishment of Branch Offices: Interior refugees entering customs to seek food come by land through areas such as Shanhaiguan, Suizhong, and Jinzhou. Those coming by water disembark at ports such as Dalian and Yingkou. Although it was previously stipulated that branch offices should be established wherever they pass by land and water, most counties have not implemented this. Only branch offices have been established in Hunhebao, Shilihe, Dawa, Qingshuitai, and Dahushan, providing temporary food and lodging, which is still considered insufficient. It is heard that incoming refugees still suffer the hardship of begging along the way, which is far from the original purpose of relief. It is proposed to order the office to add branch offices in Dahushan, Yingkou, and Dalian, and make thorough preparations. Other counties along the way should also be ordered to establish them uniformly to facilitate communication. However, the branch offices in the counties passed through by water can be closed during the winter season when the rivers freeze to save expenses.</p>
<p>(5) Pre-planning of Expenses: The previous expenses of the General Office were raised by various sectors of society and subsidized by allocations from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, without a fixed fund. If there was a shortfall, loans were borrowed from Shenyang County, making it difficult to balance income and expenditure. This spring, the number of refugees leaving customs has already reached 250,000 from Shandong and Henan provinces, not including Zhili Province. Future expenses will be far greater than before. It is necessary to plan ahead to avoid digging wells only when thirsty. The office should be ordered to find ways to pre-plan and widely solicit donations from various sectors of society to avoid exhaustion. (February 23)</p>
<h3>The Harbin Commerce After the Silver Price Fall</h3>
<p>▲ Still not recovered after the Russian turmoil</p>
<p>▲ A sudden and heavy blow added</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch, 21st: After the gold rush and the fall of the silver price, the commerce of Harbin, which had just settled down after the Russian turmoil and was about to recover, fell into a state of stagnation again. For a month, all industries have been showing signs of decline. The prospects for recovery are hopeless for the time being. If the towns along the way do not recover to their original state as soon as possible and the gold price continues to fall, Harbin commerce will almost fall into a dead end. The situation of each industry is described below:</p>
<p>▲ General Merchandise Merchants: When general merchandise merchants settled accounts at the end of the old calendar year, according to the survey of the two Chambers of Commerce inside and outside Daoli, a total of 4212 companies closed down because they could not support the losses. 304 companies reduced their operations due to poor business. Major merchants such as Tong Fa Long, Da Luo Xin, Gong He Li, and Heng Shun Chang were only able to maintain themselves and did not lose money. Most of the closed companies were third- and fourth-class companies with capital of about 300,000 to 200,000 yuan. The reason is that the commerce of the cities and towns along the river and railway has not recovered after the Russian turmoil, the export route is blocked, and Harbin's sales are difficult to compete with major merchants. During the gold rush, goods that used to cost three qian now require a price increase. The Harbin silver dollar is also in poor condition. Once the goods are wholesale, the gold price fluctuates. Although selling in Harbin silver dollars is profitable, when remitting to Shanghai, the gold price is unknown how high it will rise. With no hope for the future and Harbin in decline, it is difficult to sell goods, so they have to declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>▲ Grain Merchants: Grain commerce is one of the main commerce in Harbin. There are hundreds of merchants who rely on storing soybeans and wheat to supply raw materials to Europe and Asia. Before the silver price fell, new grain was on the market, coinciding with the height of the Sino-Russian war, and traffic between Europe and Asia was interrupted. European merchants did not come to purchase, and the sales route was cut off. There was no business to be believed. After the resumption of traffic, the gold price soared. European merchants came to purchase, and the value of one dou in the past could buy two dou of grain. Grain merchants stored grain mostly when the gold price was stable. At this time, selling at a loss would affect the principal, otherwise the funds would be tied up. Therefore, they had to sell a little, even at a loss. Therefore, after the New Year's Day of the old calendar this year, the largest number of merchants reduced their scope or changed to other industries.</p>
<p>▲ Flour and Oil Industry: Flour mills and oil workshops, like grain merchants, occupy an important position in Harbin commerce. Last year, during the Russian turmoil, the authorities banned the export of flour. Flour mills had to reduce their milling capacity and temporarily stop production. However, due to the flour ban, the sales in South Manchuria were occupied by American flour. After the war was settled, the gold rush was surging. American flour, with its economic power, reduced prices for sale. Harbin flour competed at too high a price and reduced prices, but it was beyond its power, which led to a shortened sales route. In the past, oil workshops and oil cakes could be sold to Europe, but now, due to the fall in silver, Europe cannot be shipped out at a loss.</p>
<p>▲ Gold Notes and Harbin Dollars: The price of gold and silver in Harbin has always been in a ratio of 83 to 17. Every tael of red gold is exchanged for 83 Harbin dollars, and every tael of standard silver is exchanged for 17 Harbin dollars. Since the gold price rose, red gold has risen to 11.1 yuan per tael, while standard silver has fallen to 1.24 yuan. Every yuan of Tianjin and Shanghai silver dollars can only be exchanged for about 1.23 Harbin dollars. In the past, silver dollars were rare in Harbin. Now, they are occasionally seen in the market. Although the price of Japanese gold notes seems to have risen slightly, it is more moderate compared to the gold price. Therefore, the merchants who used to deal with Shanghai now all turn to Dalian and Osaka. Invisibly, gold notes are the main currency of Harbin after the silver price fall, and Harbin is also a commercial tail of Japan. Although the price of Harbin dollars against silver has improved slightly, its subjugation to gold notes is even greater than before. During this silver price fall, banks still issued excessive amounts of irredeemable paper money, which made the market economy even more panicked. The Special Zone Chief Executive's Office recently announced that Harbin dollars that have not been stamped by the supervisor may not be circulated in the market. However, even after the tickets have been stamped, their number has not decreased. Indirectly, the gold price rise still has a great impact on the commercial economy and people's livelihood materials. The survey of the number of Harbin dollars issued by each bank is as follows: (1) The Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces: 11 million yuan in ten-yuan notes, 2 million yuan in five-yuan notes, and 1 million yuan in one-yuan notes, for a total of 14 million yuan. (2) The Border Industry Bank: 5 million yuan in ten-yuan notes, 3.5 million yuan in five-yuan notes, and 200,000 yuan in one-yuan notes, for a total of 8.7 million yuan. (3) The Bank of China: 2 million yuan in ten-yuan notes, 1 million yuan in five-yuan notes, and 500,000 yuan in one-yuan notes, for a total of 3.5 million yuan. (4) The Guangxin Company: 1 million yuan in ten-yuan notes, 1 million yuan in five-yuan notes, and 100,000 yuan in one-yuan notes, for a total of 2.1 million yuan. (5) The Bank of Communications: 6 million yuan in ten-yuan notes, 2.5 million yuan in five-yuan notes, and 500,000 yuan in one-yuan notes, for a total of 9 million yuan. The total amount issued by the above five banks is 37.3 million yuan, not including fractional notes. After the gold rush, Harbin merchants have suffered from the silver price fall, the Russian turmoil, and now the harm of Harbin dollars. They have been devastated and cannot recover. The harm is simply indescribable.</p>

<h3>Local Communications</h3>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Robbing a widow, destroying property, and kidnapping people: Ling Fengshi, a young widow in Zhangze Township, Songjiang County, is somewhat attractive. She voluntarily remarried Gu Asheng, who runs a tea house, as his wife. Unexpectedly, her younger brother-in-law, Ling Shilai, wanted to marry her and planned to set a date for worshiping Buddha and entering the bridal chamber. Ling Fengshi, fearing being forced, secretly went to Gu's place to get married to prevent her younger brother-in-law from coveting her. Ling Shilai, upon hearing this, was consumed by jealousy. He went to Gu Asheng's tea house with his mother, Ling Chen, to question him. He also invited many people to destroy all the tables, benches, doors, and windows. The police substation of the town, upon receiving a report, summoned Gu Asheng, Ling Fengshi, and others to the case. Unexpectedly, Ling Shilai, instigated by others, impatiently joined forces with Shouquanfu and Xu Are to go to the substation and rob Ling Fengshi, forcing her to marry him.

Magistrate Huang of Wuxian County specifically inspected the Yingshan and other places of the section on the 27th. As the road terrain is slightly lower, it needs to be raised slightly, so it will take a little longer before it can be opened to traffic. In addition, the Sumu Road has also been half-finished. After the Li Shu to Su section is completed, it will also be open to traffic soon.</p>
<p>The Headquarters Cancels the Wanted Order for Ma Yuren: Colonel Xu of the 31st Garrison Regiment received an order yesterday (28th) from Xiong Shihui, commander of the Songhu Garrison, to cancel the wanted order for Ma Yuren.

Considering his statement, it is quite sincere. In addition to approving the order, I will ask the National Government to issue a clear order to announce it and specifically inquire about it, exempting it from arrest, and immediately transfer the order to all subordinates to be aware of the reasons, etc." In addition to the separate orders, it is imperative to obey and order all subordinates to obey this order.</p>

<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Two Cases of Arresting Gambling and Assaulting Police: Chen Jiaochao's family in Tianfu'an Town, the third district of the county, held a banquet for guests on the 25th. After the dinner, relatives and friends were gambling for entertainment. A patrol leader of the third substation of the fourth branch of the Public Security Bureau (stationed in the town's Land Temple) heard about it and led the police to raid. The gamblers, seeing this, panicked and turned off the lights, causing the gambling silver on the table to be lost. The villagers, suspecting that bandits had broken into their homes at night with weapons, tied up the police officers with ropes and injured two of them. The town chief, Lu Ziwang, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and asked about the situation. He first released the police officers and comforted them as much as possible. The patrol leader, seeing the crowd of villagers at the time of the incident, feared misfortune and secretly reported to the substation for assistance. Upon receiving the report, Patrol Officer Lu Shoumao went to inspect the scene the next morning. He first sent the injured police officers to Kunshan for treatment and then reported to Director Zou Wusan for investigation and arrest of the perpetrators. It is unknown how it will end. In addition, Chen A'quan's family in Youxiang Village in the district also held a banquet for his daughter-in-law on the 27th of last month and gathered to play mahjong. The third substation of the fourth branch of the Public Security Bureau, upon receiving a report, sent Patrol Leader Wang with the police. They seized a mahjong set and more than ten silver dollars on the spot. The gamblers were all relatives of Chen. Chen pleaded with Patrol Leader Wang to exempt them from arrest and guaranteed to pay the fine. Wang insisted on taking them back for handling, which offended the public and gathered the crowd with gongs, regarding them as bandits. Wang and others were surrounded halfway and suffered minor injuries. They had to break through and escape by swimming. After returning to the station, they sent the village chief Lu to hand over the murderers. Lu said that he was not at the scene at the time and could not identify them, so he was detained. It has now been reported to Director Zou Wusan for investigation and strict handling.</p>
<p>Fengxian</p>
<p>The Warden of the Detention Center is promoted to Prison Official: Wang Nian'e, the warden of the West Office Detention Center of this county, has been promoted to the Wuxi Prison Officer by the High Court. He has already received the appointment letter, but the county government has not yet received the order, so Warden Wang's handover cannot be scheduled for the time being.</p>
<p>The Branch of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association is Established: The Traditional Chinese Medicine Association previously resolved to delineate areas and organize branch associations and sent personnel to prepare for it. They have reported and established them one after another. A total of eleven branch associations have been established in the county, but the seventh, eighth, and ninth branch associations still need to be reorganized. Qu Gongxia, Yuan Guangming, and Tang Xibo have been commissioned to be responsible for carrying out the work.</p>
<p>Continuation of the Zhang Brothers' False Accusation of Theft: The villagers Zhang Er and Zhang Si in Fang Twenty Tu were falsely accused of theft. It is now learned that the case was originally confessed by Zhou Youyu, a robbery offender from Tinglin Township. However, upon interrogation, he suddenly claimed that he did not know about it, but was told by the escaped accomplice Qi Amao. The Song County Government, seeing that it was not entirely true, and finding that Zhou Theft and Zhang had a fight and old grudges, specifically sent the police to investigate the truth.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Zhu, the Chief of the Bao Wei, Captured Bandits: Zhu Meiji, the chief of the Bao Wei of Huai Xia City, captured a bandit named Jin Azhang (i.e., Chen Azhang) in the village the day before yesterday, leading the Tuan Ding. A pawn ticket of a certain pawn shop in Anzhen was found on the body of the offender. After the team interrogated him, he confessed that he was an accomplice in the robbery of the Yangjian boat and the Wu family in Hongshan, and three other cases. According to the confession, Zhu immediately sent members of the team to the pawnshop to recover the stolen goods and notified the Wu family to come to identify the stolen goods, which were indeed his own. He then sent the offender to the county yesterday for interrogation.</p>
<p>The Police Released the Key Communist Criminal by Bribery: Liu Zhijun, the chief of the 13th Branch of the Public Security Bureau in Yanqiao Town, Tiangshang City, reported the day before yesterday that there were gambling gatherings in a certain teahouse in Chengtang, and immediately sent many police officers to the address to investigate. More than ten gamblers were arrested on the spot and taken to the bureau. Unexpectedly, one of them, Cao Hequan, was a follower of Wang Jun, the famous Communist leader in the city. He did all kinds of evil in the village, and everyone was afraid of him. After Cao Hequan was arrested, he asked the police officers to release him with a heavy sum of money. The police officers, after receiving the bribe, secretly opened the handcuffs of the offender. When they arrived near Baoli Bridge halfway, the offender jumped into the river and fled.</p>
<p>The Xicheng Highway is About to be Completed: The south section of the Xicheng Highway in this county has been under construction since last year. The earthwork has been completed long ago. The bridge construction project can also be completed in a short period of time. Only the road surface paving project has not yet started. Yao Dixin, the Director of the Construction Bureau, specifically drafted a plan for the road surface paving project and submitted it to the Department for approval. He advertised for bidding, which was scheduled to be held in public at the bureau today. It is estimated that the entire project will be fully completed by mid-April and will be opened to traffic in early May of this year.</p>
<p>Constructing the Scenery Around the Lake: Sun Daoshi, the director of the Wuxi Municipal Preparation Office, stated that the scenery around the lake in the county is natural. As the Eight County and City Local Products Exhibition is approaching, he urged local people to actively organize, engage in renovation, and refresh. Since yesterday, a lake embankment has been built from the lakeside to Xiaojishan, about two miles long. The embankment surface is three feet wide and can accommodate three cars side by side. Red and white lotus flowers are planned to be planted on both sides of the embankment. Famous Suzhou florists have been hired to plant them in Wuxi. A swimming pool has been opened in front of Xiaojishan. Construction has begun. Several Spanish-style houses are planned to be built on the mountain for lake tours and summer retreats. In addition, the Xianlidun Bridge, which is the main road from the urban area to Wuli Lake, has also been raised by Director Sun to raise 25,000 yuan, which is scheduled to be hired to build it within days.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Hua Du Bridge Experienced a Series of Robberies: At 10 o'clock last night, more than ten bandits suddenly came to Xie Wengen's house in Fuhua Township, Hua Du Bridge, Wu County, armed with pistols, flashlights, and single knives. They broke into the house and searched wantonly, lasting three hours before leaving. Then they went to the neighboring round office to rob, hitting the official Wang Baosheng in a vital part with a bullet, and robbing cash, clothes, and other items. Afterwards, Wang Qingtong, the district chief of the eighth district, reported the case to the county on the 27th, and the injured were taken to Wuxi Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Meetings of Various Industries of the County Chamber of Commerce: The Wu County Chamber of Commerce convened meetings of various industries at 3 pm on the 27th to discuss various cases. (1) The winter defense of the urban area increased the number of patrol teams by 20. The original plan was to handle it for three months, which has now expired. It was publicly decided to continue to run it for three months. (2) The County Government urged the collection of compilation and dispatch treasury bonds. It was publicly decided to find out the subscription of each industry and collect and remit it immediately if the treasury bonds were not paid or were insufficient for each subscription.

Those who have not written should be persuaded to subscribe by the Chamber of Commerce and the town chief together.</p>
<p>Qingpu</p>
<p>The Graves Within the County Road Line Were Ordered to be Moved: Since the construction of the Qinghu County Road began, the project has been progressing smoothly. However, there are many obstacles to the graves of civilians on the route, which should be urged to move to avoid obstacles. The cost of moving the graves was submitted by the Construction Bureau to the Provincial Construction Department for instructions. Brick graves cost three yuan per coffin, and earthen graves cost two yuan per coffin. Each district along the line will set a deadline to move the graves as soon as possible and clear them all within one month.</p>
<p>Staff Members Went to the Provincial Government for Examination and Inquiry: The County Government of this county received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs stating that the quality of county government facilities is ultimately determined by whether the county magistrate can work hard, and the staff members in charge of administration are very important for their supporting role. In order to promote political training and assess the county magistrate's ability to lead, all section chiefs and secretaries who have not been directly appointed by the Department should take turns going to the Provincial Department for individual examination and inquiry before the examination for administrative staff is held. After receiving the order, the county government ordered the section chiefs and secretaries to go to the provincial government for examination and inquiry.</p>

<p>Commencement of Construction on the Northern Section of Chengxi Highway: The northern section of the Chengxi Highway is now commencing construction, starting with the Qingyang to Yueqiao section.

<p>Conference to Dredge the Dongheng River: The Dongheng River is one of the four major rivers in Jiangyin. Due to years without dredging, it has become severely silted. Previously, a district heads' conference discussed dredging. On the 26th, the county government convened another meeting, deciding that due to the shortage of water conservancy funds, the previous method of "industry feeds tenancy" would be used for a dredging operation. To serve as a model river, the Construction Bureau, in conjunction with relevant districts, will establish a dedicated office to hire workers to dredge and excavate. All expenses for dams, piles, etc., will be reported by the county government and the Construction Bureau to the Construction Department, requesting the use of water conservancy funds. Simultaneously, the Construction Bureau will prepare a budget. The meeting adjourned after discussions.</p>

This has been approved by the Provincial Government Committee. As the spring plowing season is approaching, the department urgently needs to provide the loans to benefit poor farmers. However, the exact number of poor farming households in each county has not been thoroughly investigated, lacking a basis. Therefore, a detailed list of poor farming households has been formulated, and agricultural investigators have been assigned to conduct detailed investigations in each district. Within seven days, they are to submit the names of poor farming households in each township, according to the list, to the district office for compilation, and then forwarded to the respective county governments by March 15 for safekeeping, in preparation for loan disbursement.</p>

However, the location is still undecided, with three options: the county party headquarters, the Jie Xiao Temple, and the former site of Asia. Once preparations are complete, 43 Chinese goods factories in Shanghai will pack and ship their goods by special train to the province for display.</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Department Examines County Section Chiefs and Secretaries: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs considers the section chiefs and secretaries of each county government, who assist the county magistrates in all matters, to be in very important positions. Therefore, a special examination form has been drafted and distributed to each county, requiring them to fill in their resumes, native places, recent administrative plans, policy guidelines, specialized skills, publications, party membership status, and any difficulties encountered, in order to investigate and reorganize them.</p>

Subsequently, the police team affiliated with the Second Squadron apprehended Zhou Jingwang, Zhou Fuzhi, and An Youwei. On the 24th, they were presented to the Dashui Headquarters and transferred to the county government for legal action.</p>
<p>Collapse of Over Sixty Zhang of Sanhe Dam: The old Sanhe Dam, located at the intersection of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, was a large project. In the past, salt merchants in the West Dam donated large sums of money annually for repairs to facilitate water storage and navigation. In recent years, the salt industry has not been very prosperous, making it difficult to raise funds. They reluctantly started construction last autumn, adding earth and sweeping to provide support. Unexpectedly, this spring, before repairs could begin, over sixty zhang of the earthwork was washed away by a storm on the night of the 23rd, and the front of the dam is also quite dangerous. Upon receiving this news, the dam merchants convened a meeting of merchants from both the shipping and shore sides to discuss preparations for remedial measures to prevent the scope from expanding.</p>
<p>Changes in Bureau Director and Team Leader: Yang Tie, the Director of the Huaiyin Public Security Bureau, has now been dismissed by order of the Jiangsu Department of Civil Affairs. The vacancy has been provisionally filled by the team leader of the local police brigade. The position of police brigade leader has been filled by the county magistrate of this county, by order of the department. Today (the 25th), County Magistrate Xu has ordered Brigade Leader Zhao Zhenhua to expedite the handover.

He was then sent to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the county government for legal action.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Scattered Interest Income Should Belong to the Province: Jiang Zhicheng, the county magistrate of Jiaxing, stated that the provincial taxes and local funds received by the county government daily have already been allocated without any remaining. However, since County Magistrate Jiang took office on July 11 of the 18th year, until December 20 of the same year, the scattered savings under the county government's administrative expenses amounted to 94 yuan in interest income. County Magistrate Jiang believes that this interest income should belong to the public, but there are no clear regulations as to whether it should belong to the province or be considered local public funds. Therefore, he recently submitted a request to the province for instructions. It is now learned that the Department of Finance, after receiving the report, considers that the scattered savings are mostly provincial taxes, and therefore the interest income should belong to the province and be deposited in a special account in the county treasury.</p>
<p>This County's Land Will Undergo Actual Survey: The land reports submitted by various villages and neighborhoods in Jiaxing are now largely clear. They are currently rushing to create summary registers and allocate plot maps for closing the reports. According to news circulating in political circles, the province intends to conduct an actual survey of Jiaxing and Pinghu counties first after the land report closure in this county to clarify the actual acreage of land. Once preparations are complete, surveyors will be recruited and implementation will begin on schedule.</p>

<p>Department Orders Counties to Eradicate Poppy Seedlings: The Zhejiang Department of Civil Affairs, considering that the spring weather has arrived and the poppy seedlings are about to sprout, specially issued an order to all county magistrates yesterday to personally inspect each area and ensure that they are eradicated completely. If poppy seedlings are found again in the county in the future, severe punishment will be imposed.</p>
<p>Inspection of Dahua Flying Boat Operation: Sun Yunxiang, Director of the Zhejiang Maritime Affairs Bureau, has learned that the Dahua Company's flying boat is operating between Hangzhou and Lanxi. He will personally ride it on the second (tomorrow) for an on-site inspection to serve as a reference for the maritime administration of shallow rivers throughout the province.</p>
<p>Shangyu</p>
<p>Xuan Xiasheng Kidnapped and Shot Dead: Xuan Xiasheng, a wealthy household in Shifei Village, Nanxiang, had been kidnapped and extorted for large sums of money several times by bandits. As a result, he moved to a villa in the city for years. At the end of last year, believing the area was peaceful, he returned to his old house for the New Year. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 25th of this month, he was visited by bandits again. At the time, Xiasheng had already gone to sleep. First, two bandits in short clothes and armed with weapons broke down the front door and dragged Xiasheng out of bed. A shot was fired, and five more accomplices immediately jumped in and escorted Xiasheng away with handguns. Neighbors heard the alarm and sounded gongs. The Xiaguan Security Team and the Chenxikou Defense Corps, located five li from the village, received the information and pursued them. As they approached the Huangmang Bridge, the bandits, seeing the situation was not good, pulled out their guns and shot Xiasheng dead, leaving his body on the ground and fleeing in different directions. Xiasheng's son, Baren, heard the news in the city and rushed to the scene on the morning of the 26th to report to the county and request an arrest.</p>
<p>Two Major Theft Cases in Three Days: The Jinlongshou family on Xixiao Street in the city had thieves break in on the night of the 23rd and steal several items of jewelry, clothing, etc., resulting in a loss of over 400 yuan. Also, on the evening of the 25th, the home of Hu A'zeng, a clerk at the Tianzhitang Pharmacy in the city, was broken into by thieves, who stole gold, silver, jewelry, clothing, etc., resulting in a loss of over 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Election of Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Self-Government Encouragement Association: The preparation for the local self-government encouragement association in this county has been underway for several months. Yesterday morning, the association held a meeting at the county merchants' meeting hall to elect the executive and supervisory committees. The election results were: Yu Jingli, Liu Jie'an, Zhu Yuntai, Guan Yangzhi, Huang Zhun, Qian Youlan, and Bei Zairan were elected as executive committee members; Xiang Jingsun, Zhu Qiqiao, and Li Qishan were elected as supervisory committee members.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>Riot by Villagers in Lishan Township: The residents of Lishan in northern Yuyao are mostly farmers. The county party headquarters believes that it is necessary to organize a farmers' association. Therefore, Zhou Zifang and others were dispatched some time ago as organizers for the farmers' association in that area and have been working on preparations, which are now complete. The inaugural meeting was scheduled for 1:00 PM yesterday. Xie Xianzeng and others, the standing committee members of the county party headquarters, went to provide guidance. Because there was no suitable location for the meeting at the time, the Lucheng Temple near Lishan was borrowed as the venue. Just as the meeting was about to begin, with over sixty farmer representatives from various villages in attendance, the temple manager came out to stop it. Then, under the instigation of the village chief, Lu Ruiyuan, over a thousand villagers, each holding knives and clubs, swarmed into the venue, driving and beating people, and setting fire to the portrait of the Prime Minister, the party-state flag, and various documents. At that time, Xie Xianzeng and other representatives, seeing that the situation was not good, immediately escaped through the back door. Two or three hundred rioters chased after them, stopping near Zhouxiang. Zhou Zifang, one of the organizers, was unable to escape and was stabbed in the head and body in three places. He was severely injured and was taken to the county court for examination of injuries and then sent to the hospital for treatment. After escaping danger, the county party representative entered the city at night and urgently requested the troops stationed in the city to send troops to suppress the riot. The outcome is unknown.</p>
<p>Resignations of Department Heads in the Municipal Government: Chen Ruxin, Head of the Social Affairs Department of the Ningbo Municipal Government, Wang Huanbo, Head of the Education Department, Wang Chengzhi, Head of the Health Department, and Chen Zhongci, Head of the Land Registration Office, have all resigned because Mayor Luo has resigned.</p>
<p>Assassins Separately Sentenced: Chen Zengyun and his family of four in Pingwang Temple Village, Zhouxiang, Yuyao, were assassinated in July of last year, with no survivors. Subsequently, the county government offered a reward for the arrest of the murderers. Chen Chunquan, Chen Fenglin, and Cao Gongchuan were arrested one after another. Although the county government interrogated them repeatedly, no judgment was made until now. The county court was established, and yesterday the president of the court, Wang Gao, tried the case and delivered the following judgment: Chen Chunquan was sentenced to death, Cao Gongchuan was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Chen Fenglin was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, with deprivation of public rights for life. It is said that Chen and others refused to accept the judgment and are preparing to appeal.</p>
<p>Dinghai Radio Station Can Now Transmit Electricity: The Ministry of Communications, in order to facilitate communication and prevent piracy, has built a radio station in Dinghai. It is now learned that the station has been completed, and the internal electrical current has also been completely arranged. It was handed over to personnel from the Ministry for acceptance on the 20th, and officially started transmitting electricity yesterday.</p>
<p>Self-Government Students Assigned to Work in Ningbo: The second class of students from the Provincial Self-Government Training School has now graduated. Yesterday, the Department of Civil Affairs assigned 21 students to work in various counties in the Ningbo area: He Xizhao, Li Shijie, Li Tang, Chen Rongchang, and Dong Kaizi in Yin County; Wang Huaming and Zhu Yizhang in Cixi; Zheng Shousong, Lü Jiyuan, and Xu Huimin in Zhenhai; Jiang Shen and Liu Shici in Dinghai; Shen Shouqian and Wang Chunqing in Xiangshan; Cai Huailiu in Nantian; Huang Weizhen, Huang Gongjue, Jiang Bocheng, Fan Yiwo, Tong Quanru, Xu Taifa, and Lu Tanran in Yuyao.</p>
<p>Shaoxing</p>
<p>Establishment of the National Goods Promotion Association: The Shaoxing National Goods Promotion Association is now ready for establishment. On the afternoon of the 27th, the inaugural meeting was held in the auditorium of the County Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Villages and Towns Along the Xiaochang Road: Personnel have now been dispatched to measure and acquire land along the Xiaochang Road passing through various villages and towns in Shaoxing and Xiao counties, including: Jianshan, Tangxiadu, Zhujiadun, Guandimiao, Sunjiadu, Jiangshiqiao, Wuguishan, Shijiatou, Tujialong, Zoumaqiao, Tangjia, Sunlangqiao, Xiayan, Yangjianong, Linpu, and Luozhuang.</p>
<p>Resolutions of the Construction Committee Meeting: The Shaoxing Construction Committee held its third standing meeting yesterday, resolving: (1) In response to the department's order to set up water gauge stations, rain gauge stations, and buoy stations in the Xia Cha Lake, Huitou, Sunduan, Longchishan, and Canal areas, Committees Song and Sun were designated to review the cases before further discussion.

<p>Compilation of District, Township, and Town Regulations: The Shaoxing County Government has been ordered to prepare regulations for districts, townships, and towns and is now proceeding accordingly. The compilation method is based on five households forming a neighborhood, twenty-five households forming a lane, a village of one hundred households forming a township, a market town of one hundred households forming a town, and twenty to forty townships and towns forming a district.</p>
<p>Dangtu</p>
<p>Xuezhen Self-Defense Corps Plundered: The Xuezhen Self-Defense Corps detachment in Dangtu Eastern Township has been quite effective in defending the entire town on weekdays. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 24th, over ten bandits carrying firearms attacked the self-defense corps, looting all the guns in the corps. Team Leader Wang was shot dead because he was still in bed. Fortunately, no shops in the town were looted. After receiving the report, the county government immediately sent people to investigate everything.</p>

<p>▲ Report on Party Affairs: The Municipal Executive Committee's report on Party affairs states: "Since the Fifth Citywide Delegates' Congress on February 10, 1929, the Municipal Executive and Supervisory Committees have been successively organized and established, beginning their work on March 1, for a period of one year. During this year, the Municipal Party affairs have been vast and complex. In essence, the purpose is to adhere to the resolutions of the Third National Congress's report on Party affairs and the proposals of the Fifth Citywide Delegates' Congress's report on Party affairs, and under the guidance of the Central Government, strive to strengthen the Party's organization, enrich the Party's propaganda, popularize Party training, and train the people, so that their thoughts and actions are guided by the Three Principles of the People. However, considering the achievements of the work, the strength of about five thousand comrades in the city has been gathered, and the results obtained are very meager, and the distance from the goal is still far away. This is something that cannot but be regretted when reporting on the classifications. The work report of the Municipal Executive Committee for the past year has been described in detail in special articles by various departments and committees. For the convenience of comrades' inspection, a summary of the main points of each part of the work is respectfully presented to the comrades of the Citywide Delegates' Congress: (1) From the perspective of the Party's organization, Comrade Wu Kaixian is responsible for the Organization Department. Its work can be divided into three parts: first, to strictly organize the Municipal Organization Department itself; second, to reorganize the District Party Headquarters; and third, to improve the District Sub-Branches. Regarding the first point, there are departmental meetings to determine work plans, section meetings to determine implementation methods, and municipal organization meetings to discuss organizational work issues throughout the city. However, due to various reasons, the improvement of organizational work is still trapped in a situation of having plans but no solutions. In addition, the Municipal Organization Department's knowledge of the quality and quantity of lower-level Party Headquarters is limited to a general understanding due to the incompleteness of various reports. The so-called guidance is also limited to the order of various technical tasks. Regarding the second point, healthy District Party Headquarters only handle routine affairs, while unhealthy ones neglect even this formal work. Regarding the third point, various meetings of District Sub-Branches, except for Party member congresses, which are mostly held on schedule due to the supervision of higher levels, other meetings such as discussion groups and lectures are rarely paid attention to. In summary, the extent of the healthiness of the city's organization, from the city to the district to the District Sub-Branch, does vary, but its lack of strictness and flexibility is undeniable. Therefore, although the number of District Sub-Branches has increased from one hundred and eighty-six to two hundred and one, it cannot be said that the Party's organization has made progress. Even in terms of recruiting probationary Party members, although the Municipal Organization Department has stipulated the quality and quantity of recruitment for each district and branch, and the method of allocating deadlines, the recruitment time has exceeded one-third, and some branches have not even started. Its lack of healthiness can be imagined. As for the number of Party members in the city, it has decreased from more than five thousand to less than five thousand. Although a small number have died, been expelled, or moved out of the city, most have unclear addresses after relocation. This further shows the weakness of Party members' relationship with the Party, which deserves the deep attention of our comrades in order to correct it in the future. (2) From the perspective of the Party's propaganda, Comrade Chen Dezheng is responsible for the Propaganda Department. Its work can also be divided into three parts: first, based on the Party's theories, program, and the Founding Father's teachings, the Municipal Department compiles propaganda publications; second, it guides lower-level Party Headquarters and cultural organizations to unify propaganda; and third, it bans the circulation of all reactionary publications. Regarding the first point, the publications edited by the Municipal Propaganda Department, in addition to the regular Shanghai Party Voice Weekly and Times Bi-Monthly, include numerous series, commemorative special issues, and commemorative booklets. Regarding the second point, it has formulated and issued eighty-three propaganda guidelines and outlines, held twenty-eight commemorative meetings of various kinds, and provided full guidance to propaganda meetings, lecture meetings, and speech contests in various districts. Regarding the third point, during this period of revolutionary progress, in order to unify revolutionary will, all publications that violated the Central Government's orders and were deemed ideologically reactionary by the Municipal Propaganda Department were banned. The handling of newspaper registration, inspection of news mail, and review of dramas and films was all based on whether they violated the Party's principles. Summarizing the achievements of past work, although it cannot be said that the department has not done its part in clarifying the principles, suppressing rebellion, opposing Red Russia, supporting the Reorganization Conference, abolishing consular jurisdiction, and implementing the Seven Movements, it has not been able to fully elaborate on the Party's spirit of revolution or provide a concrete plan for how to implement the Party's principles. As a result, the publications of this committee, on the one hand, cannot fully arouse the public's interest in reading, and on the other hand, cannot form the central publications for comrades throughout the city to discuss Party affairs. At the same time, reactionary publications continue to spread under the protection of the concessions. This is something that all our comrades should reflect on and work hard to improve. (3) From the perspective of the Party's training, Comrade Tong Xingbai is responsible for the Training Department. Its work can be divided into three parts: Party affairs education, Party member training, and Party affairs education and testing. Regarding the first point, the Municipal Training Department has paid great attention to the training of staff at all levels of the Party Headquarters, such as urging the study of Party principles, examining work diligence, and arranging appropriate educational environments. However, the Municipal Training Conference is not held frequently, and the District Training Conferences are often not convened on schedule, so the training results are inevitably affected. Regarding the second point, although there are many ways to use District Sub-Branches to train Party members, only discussion groups have been somewhat effective. Even in terms of discussion groups, only 21% of District Sub-Branches can hold them on schedule, while 20% have never held them. Those that convene meetings do not show full enthusiasm, let alone others. Regarding the third point, the Municipal Training Department has jointly held the third examination of Party principles teachers with the Municipal Education Bureau, promulgated examination regulations, and compiled guidance outlines. It has also sent personnel to inspect and test the implementation of Party principles education in various schools. It has held Party principles tests for staff of political, military, and police agencies in stages to fulfill its supervisory and examination responsibilities. However, based on the results achieved, the future of Party governance does not seem to be fully optimistic. In short, training work is one of the most important tasks in the Party's entire process, but in the past year, the training work of this committee has still not been free from the defect of not being universal, which is undeniable. (4) From the perspective of public training, it was initially the responsibility of the seven comrades Shi Gongmeng, Wu Kaixian, Chen Dezheng, Tong Xingbai, Deng Tongwei, Hou Dachun, and Tang Demin, and then Comrade Tao Baichuan was promoted to fill the vacancy after Comrade Tang changed to a standing committee member, and Shi Tongmin was the standing committee member of the Public Training Committee. Its work in the past year has been devoted to passive coping due to the complexity of the social situation in the city, the arrogance of reactionary elements, and the failure to eliminate erroneous concepts of past mass movements, and there has been no active and spontaneous undertaking to train the people. In terms of mass organizations, this committee has promulgated standards for the organization of trade unions, outlines of trade union constitutions, outlines of the preparatory committee for the General Federation of Trade Unions, and regulations for the organizational committee of student groups in order to have a basis. It has also examined trade union secretaries to assist in the health of trade union organizations. However, with the successive promulgation of central laws and regulations, the regulations promulgated by this committee will inevitably have to be revised later, and mass organizations will inevitably change slightly as a result. The Public Training Committee has handled 587 cases related to the organization of workers, peasants, youth, and women's groups in the past year, 537 cases related to disputes, and only 175 cases related to other matters. It can be seen that organizational matters actually account for all the processed work.</p>
<p>45%. In other words, the past public training work has been mainly focused on organization, and the reorganization of worker organizations accounts for more than half of the reorganization. As a result of the reorganization, there are still no fully healthy mass groups, the concept of respecting the Party and abiding by the law cannot be popularized among the leaders of mass groups, and there is no time for other positive movements to improve people's livelihoods. This is a major regret of public training work, and it is something that our comrades should not ignore. (5) In terms of the Secretariat, which handles routine affairs, the three comrades Fan Zhengbo, Pan Gongzhan, and Niu Changfu were responsible for it. After Comrade Niu passed away, Comrade Tang Demin was promoted to fill the vacancy. In terms of documentation and examination, from March 1929 to January 1930, the entire Party Headquarters received a total of 592,300 documents and sent out a total of 87,855 documents. In terms of affairs, the total income for eleven months was 318,673.439 yuan, the expenditure was 296,567.950 yuan, and the balance was 33,105.534 yuan. The average monthly expenditure for Party affairs in the city reached a huge sum of 26,960 yuan. With such a large expenditure on Party affairs in the city, how can the Party Headquarters not make considerable achievements and contributions to the Party and the country and the citizens? What guilt will our comrades bear? In short, the Party affairs in the past year were during the period of the rebellious party members' movement. Since the Gui clique warlords rebelled, Zhang Fakui, Wang Jingwei, Feng Yuxiang, and Tang Shengzhi rebelled against the Party and caused chaos in the country, one after another. Recently, they have joined forces with the Reorganization Faction and the National Socialist Faction of the Shanxi Conference, as well as the frustrated warlords and politicians of the Beiyang clique, to support Yan Xishan in an attempt to recreate internal strife, and Yan is also willing to be used by them. In this period of struggle between revolutionary forces and reactionary groups, the peaceful reunification policy decided by the Central Government cannot be realized, and we have no choice but to resort to military warfare. All construction has come to a standstill as a result. The comrades of this committee, in Shanghai, the stronghold of reactionary forces in the rear, can recognize the Party's principles, system, and policies, support the Central Government, and carry through to the end, and stand with the reactionary forces. Although the achievements in active work are very small, the firmness of will is something to be comforted by. I sincerely hope that the Central Government representatives and the comrades of the Congress will provide guidance and supervision. Thank you very much.</p>
<h3>Continuously Increasing Premium</h3>
<p>▲ The Future is Very Worrying</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the renewed decline in silver prices in London and New York, although the exchange rate remained unchanged from the previous day, the premium rose again to a new high of 505.2 taels. The closing price in the afternoon was 501.1 taels, which was the lowest price in the afternoon. According to a San Francisco telegram, the Indian silver market has fallen to an unprecedented low, and many Indian merchants have gone bankrupt as a result. With the continuous decline in silver prices, it is not known where it will end. The future is bleak and very worrying.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Left Mawei Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Yang Shuzhuang Did Not Accompany Him to Shanghai ▲ Expected to Arrive Tonight or Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>Shanghai Special Municipality Mayor Zhang Qun was previously ordered by the Central Government to go to Fujian to investigate. Some days ago, Zhang telegraphed the Municipal Government, saying that Fujian had prepared considerable measures and would return to Shanghai to report to the central government in the coming days. Yesterday, the local Naval Reorganization Office received a telegram from Fujian stating that Mayor Zhang left Mawei at 9:30 AM today (28th) on the Pu'an warship to Shanghai, leaving Secretary Guo Shihui in Fujian to handle everything. Chairman Yang also did not come with him. It is reported that the Pu'an warship is expected to arrive in Shanghai tonight or early tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren and Song Ziwen Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>Yu Youren and Song Ziwen both took the night express train from Shanghai to Beijing at 11:00 PM last night.</p>
<h3>National Goods Association Opposes Sino-Japanese Agreement</h3>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association recently sent a telegram to the National Government and ministries regarding the Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Agreement, stating, "According to news reports, the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement includes using their manufactured goods and our raw materials as the scope of reciprocity. After reading this, we are extremely shocked. Most of our country's exports are raw materials, while most of Japan's goods to China are manufactured goods, which have always benefited from low taxes. If we ship manufactured goods to Japan, they will be immediately rejected by heavy taxes. If we agree to a reciprocal low tax rate for our raw materials and Japanese manufactured goods, our country's manufactured goods will still not be able to obtain the benefit of low taxes. This is tantamount to encouraging our country's raw materials to be exported, prohibiting our country's manufactured goods from being exported, and encouraging Japanese manufactured goods to be shipped to China to invade our economy and oppress our national goods. We earnestly request that the National Government and ministries consider the overall situation of national tariffs and the people's livelihood, adhere to tariff autonomy, and absolutely not allow foreign interference. A reciprocal agreement is not yet the time. One wrong move will cause permanent harm. We also request that the full text of the new Sino-Japanese treaty be copied and sent to our association first, so that our national goods colleagues can study it in detail, offer opinions, and be prepared to be adopted. We urgently submit this telegram and respectfully request instructions to be followed. This will be very convenient for the Party."</p>
<h3>Naming of Newly Purchased Naval Aircraft</h3>
<p>The Gaochangmiao Naval Aircraft Office previously purchased three Mies seaplanes from the United Kingdom. After repeated test flights, the results were excellent.

The captain is First-Class Pilot Fujimoto, and there are three other staff members.</p>
<h3>Anti-Opium Society Requests Implementation of Opium Ban and Promotion of Anti-Drug Campaign</h3>
<p>The Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is scheduled to be held in Beijing today. The China National Anti-Opium Society has specially requested the Congress to:</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Instruct the National Government to strictly ban opium and promote anti-drug campaigns, in order to eliminate the scourge of opium and strengthen the country's foundation. The original request is excerpted as follows: "Regarding the implementation of opium bans and the promotion of anti-drug campaigns to eliminate the scourge of opium and strengthen the country's foundation, we are deeply concerned that the opium scourge has plagued China for a century. Bans have been implemented and relaxed, and the poison has not yet been completely eliminated. The National Government, in accordance with the Founding Father's teachings and responding to the people's demands, has adopted a complete ban and established the Opium Prohibition Committee to specialize in this task. In the past two years, the opium ban has shown some signs of progress. However, according to reports from various sources, provinces such as Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou are still planting opium seedlings, and there are cases of forced planting with taxation. The Special Tax Offices in Hunan and Hubei have increased their monthly tax revenue to more than 2 million yuan. Opium from Sichuan and Guizhou is collected in Hankou for taxation, poisoning the provinces in the Yangtze River basin. Guangxi and Guangdong have established opium monopoly bureaus, still implementing the opium monopoly system, violating the National Government's clear orders, contravening the opium ban administration, and causing international embarrassment. These are the most serious cases. As for the investigation of public officials, the central government and various provinces are often hindered by emotions and do not implement it quickly. Various provinces are even more ineffective in banning opium, acting against orders in secret, which is evident everywhere. The various situations are no less serious than in the past. The upper levels cannot understand the National Government's determination to ban opium, and the lower levels cannot meet the people's long-standing expectations. In addition, narcotic drugs are rampant in the northeastern and southeastern provinces. Illegal drugs are imported from overseas in a steady stream. The concessions in various places are even protecting manufacturing and transportation. This is also the biggest obstacle to the opium ban. The late Founding Father said, 'The war against opium must never be compromised. If a responsible government agency lowers the flag and ceases fighting against opium for its own private convenience, it is an act of treason, no matter how long or short it lasts.' He also said, 'Anti-drug organizations should fight tirelessly.' The Founding Father had a thorough position on opium bans and left great teachings on anti-drug campaigns. The Kuomintang Party regulations also stipulate the cleansing of the opium scourge. In the current situation where various provinces are ostensibly banning opium but secretly relaxing, on the one hand, the government should strictly crack down and severely punish, and on the other hand, anti-drug campaigns should be expanded throughout the country to implement the Founding Father's teachings and awaken the people to work together. On the occasion of the opening of the Congress, this society, based on its observations, respectfully presents its humble suggestions: (1) All civil and military officials and military personnel who violate the Central Government's opium ban laws shall be severely punished in accordance with the opium ban law. (2) The Special Tax Offices in Hunan and Hubei and the opium monopoly bureaus in Guangxi and Guangdong shall be abolished as soon as possible, and the authorities in Hunan and Hubei shall be severely punished for the crime of violating the Central Government's orders, and there shall be no more illegal acts of taxing opium in the future. (3) Public officials shall be thoroughly investigated. (4) Officials who are ineffective in banning opium or who engage in corruption shall be severely punished. (5) The actual situation of the scourge of narcotic drugs throughout the country shall be thoroughly investigated, and international negotiations shall be initiated. (6) Local Party and government agencies shall be instructed to promote anti-drug campaigns, with cooperation between officials and the people. The above six items are respectfully requested to be approved by the Congress and submitted to the Central Party Headquarters to instruct the National Government to implement them effectively. Whether or not this is appropriate, we respectfully request your approval and decision, and we are filled with trepidation. We respectfully submit this to the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. Respectfully submitted by the China National Anti-Opium Society."</p>
<h3>Chen Shiguang Visits British Consul General</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Chen Shiguang, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, accompanied by Section Chief Liu Yunfang, went to the British Consulate to visit the newly appointed British Consul General, Mr. Billeyna.

<h3>Yunnan Province Telegraphs Request for Sanctions Against Yan Xishan</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Weihan, concurrently Commissioner of the Yunnan Provincial Committee and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, told a Xin Shanghai reporter yesterday that he heard that Yan Xishan recently sent a telegram listing names arbitrarily, and even generals from Guizhou and Qianxi have had their names stolen. If this is true, it shows his hard work in falsifying. The Yunnan Provincial Government and all the generals have always adhered to Party principles, sincerely supported the Central Government, and remained unwavering. The provincial chairman, Long Yun, recently telegraphed him, expressing his deep indignation at Yan's outrageous remarks and stating that he would send a telegram to refute his fallacies, requesting that the Central Government severely punish him.</p>

<p>The Chinese Seamen's Industrial United General Union held its tenth-anniversary celebration on February 28th. Director Zhao Zhizhi presided over the event, and various staff members were assigned to make arrangements. A large number of attendees participated. In the auditorium, a large portrait of Sun Yat-sen was hung, surrounded by fresh flowers. Slogans were plastered around the room. A colorful archway was erected at the entrance, featuring models of ships and sailors made of flowers. Couplets were posted on both sides, reading "Leading the Workers" and "Pioneering for the Nation." The inscription on the archway read "Merit in the Party and the Nation." The full text of the couplets is too long to record. The inside and outside of the venue were decorated with lanterns and streamers, creating a magnificent atmosphere. The meeting began at 9:00 AM. Director Zhao delivered an opening speech, and Committee Member Liang Degong reported on the establishment of the union, stating that the union was established ten years ago under the secret orders of Sun Yat-sen after the Hong Kong strike returned to China and achieved victory. Sun Yat-sen named the union and sent Comrade Wu Fujun, a former member of parliament, as a representative to Hong Kong to lead the establishment. Many other guests also gave speeches. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM, marking a grand event.</p>
<h3>一百八十餘　工會呈中央文</h3>
<p>▲呈請准予成立上海總工會</p>
<p>More Than 180 Unions Submit a Document to the Central Government</p>
<p>Requesting Approval to Establish the Shanghai General Labor Union</p>
<p>A document from the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and more than 180 other unions to the Central Executive Committee (excerpt): We feel guilty that our organization is not strong and that the external environment is deteriorating. Therefore, after painful reflection, we requested the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the General Labor Union. In mid-September of the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929], the Shanghai Party Department approved the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the General Labor Union. All workers in Shanghai were overjoyed. Since May, the preparatory work has been completed step by step. We are fortunate that the official General Labor Union can be established soon, so that the labor movement in Shanghai can gradually move towards a bright future. But recently, rumors have spread that your department is unwilling to officially establish the Shanghai General Labor Union. We are all panicked and doubtful. We are filing this report in hope that you will address this. Although there is no explicit provision for a general labor union in the Labor Union Law, the actual need for it is undeniable. Moreover, according to the resolution of the Third National Congress of the Party, the Civil Training Committee of the Party Department at all levels should be abolished. However, considering the special circumstances of each special municipality, the central government, in consideration of party affairs, made expedient arrangements, and the Party Department of each special municipality can still establish the Civil Training Committee. There are now many unions in Shanghai, and their organization is scattered. Workers are under siege by corrupt forces. Under the current special and dangerous situation, we can follow the precedent of the establishment of the Civil Training Committee of the Party Department and approve the establishment of the General Labor Union. This is one reason. According to the newly promulgated Chamber of Commerce Law by the Legislative Yuan, there are provisions for organizing a National Federation of Commerce and Industry, and the existing National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce Restructuring Committee, etc. Based on the principle of equal status between industry, commerce, agriculture, and academia, the establishment of the Shanghai General Labor Union is unnecessary to prove. This is a second reason. Shanghai is a nest of reactionary forces. Seeing that they cannot succeed, the reactionary elements specialize in inciting workers to riot as their only strategy. If there is no general workers' organization, the workers will lose their leadership, and the reactionary elements will take the opportunity to incite them. The consequences are unimaginable and have no small impact on local security and the future of the Party and the country. This is the third reason. The training of the exercise of the four powers is an important policy during the period of political tutelage. There are hundreds of unions in Shanghai, and there are hundreds of thousands of workers. There must be a jurisdictional organization that specializes in the labor movement, taking a high-level lead and expanding training and instilling doctrine, so that the combination of the Party and the masses will become more solid. Its invisible support for the progress of the revolution, the elimination of reactionary clamor, and the benefit to the Party and the country are not trivial. This is the fourth reason. We have carefully considered this for the Party and the country, and we have sent Lu Jingshi, Zhang Yaoming, Gu Yongquan, Xu Shaochuan, and Ye Gonglun as representatives to explain in person. We respectfully request that you consider the situation and approve the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality General Labor Union. We eagerly await your orders. Respectfully presented to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<h3>工部局　候選董事之政見</h3>
<p>▲安諾德·雷思理·白朗·馬賽·德克等</p>
<p>Views of Candidates for the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>Arnold, Leslie, White, Maze, Dirk, etc.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times yesterday (27th) published several statements of political views by candidates for the Shanghai Municipal Council. Arnold, the former Chairman, is also one of the candidates, stating that the administrative policy of the Municipal Council should continue to seek efficiency and economy in its work and maintain its inherent power. He had proceeded in this direction during the past year, therefore he organized a Salary Committee, which is now investigating the reorganization of council members, and hired police officers from India to reorganize the police force. The education system for Westerners and Chinese is also currently under investigation and reorganization. The Municipal Council often seeks closer cooperation and better understanding between Chinese and foreign taxpayers, because only through cooperation and friendship between the two sides can the Municipal Council steadily navigate the stormy waters of today. There are many difficulties at present, and he hopes that Mr. Fei Tang can find a solution. The Municipal Council pays close attention to the telephone problem, so it hired experts from the British Post Office to come to Shanghai to investigate, and now hopes that it can be resolved satisfactorily soon. Leslie, a newly recommended British candidate, said that if elected, he would do his best to assist all programs that maintain law and order in the settlement, so that the legitimate interests of all citizens can be fully guaranteed, and to promote friendly cooperation with the surrounding areas. All events that affect the settlement must be made public, because this is as important a responsibility of the Municipal Council as maintaining security and efficiency and economy. White, a newly recommended British candidate, said that if elected, he would do his best to eliminate anything that might hinder Mr. Fei Tang's work in dealing with municipal affairs. In short, no matter what the election results are, he hopes that when Mr. Fei Tang is engaged in his arduous work, he will do his best to ensure that he does not encounter any unexpected accidents. Maze, a former director of British nationality, said that last year he hired Fei Tang, hoping to produce a permanent charter that would satisfy both Chinese and foreigners in the settlement. It is the most constructive undertaking. Although there are no major problems in the settlement at this time, there will still be major problems in the future. The recent reorganization of the police force and the increase in police force will surely greatly reduce crime. There should be long-term plans for municipal engineering, such as widening thoroughfares and expanding ditches. Now that the financial resources have been slightly improved, it should be carried out immediately. The most important task now is to dispose of garbage using scientific methods. Since the telephone is handled by a private company, the Municipal Council should do its best to satisfy users. The Municipal Council should employ more Chinese and gradually reduce the number of foreign employees in order to save expenses. Dirk, a new American candidate, said that if elected, he would do his best to maintain the laws and special rights of the settlement to the fullest extent possible and resist any attempts to deprive them. Secondly, he would focus on matters relating to traffic on the roads. There are too many important issues that are occurring. This matter has been neglected, but it should not be ignored. As for other matters, he must wait until he takes office to understand the internal affairs of the bureau and do his best. He will increase the interests of residents in the boundary regardless of nationality or race.</p>
<h3>陜西災况愈演愈烈</h3>
<p>▲餓斃仆地即被割食</p>
<p>▲木板蘆蓆時爲一空</p>
<p>The Disaster in Shaanxi is Escalating</p>
<p>Those Who Starve to Death and Fall Are Immediately Cut Up and Eaten</p>
<p>Wooden Boards and Reed Mats Are Empty in an Instant</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Relief Committee yesterday received a letter from the representative of the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Committee, stating that it had been continuously overcast in Shaanxi for the past two months, the accumulated snow had not melted, and birds could not find food and were starving to death everywhere. The disaster victims were suffering from both cold and hunger, and no one could bear it. In addition to the police and security forces setting up shelters, the committee has gradually increased the number of shelters to nine, accommodating nearly ten thousand people. The counties outside the province have all been ordered to rush to set up porridge factories, and more than 20 of the most severely affected counties have been subsidized with relief funds ranging from two to three thousand yuan. However, the disaster is escalating, those who can save themselves do so, and those who die are left to die. Wooden boards and reed mats are emptied in an instant. In addition, the situation has changed repeatedly, and transportation has not yet been restored. The remittance of funds and the transportation of food have been suspended for a long time. However, the dead are already gone, and the living are suffering. Urgent appeals are flooding in, and relief representatives are constantly coming to the door. The funds in the association have already been distributed. They are distraught in the middle of the night and can only desperately appeal and make special arrangements to quickly raise a large sum of relief funds to save the remaining lives. They are anxiously awaiting relief. They also received a telegram from the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association in Ping, stating that the recent disaster situation in Shaanxi is extremely tragic. The famine victims in the province are gathering like bees and ants, grabbing food on the streets at will. All the counties are now exhausted, every household is closed, and few people walk on the roads. The atmosphere is gloomy, like approaching a tomb. Each pound of steamed buns costs 18,000 cash, and two liters of sorghum costs more than one yuan. Young women are begging for food, only seeking to be full, and then they can go home. Chickens and cats have already been eaten, and even sparrows and mice have disappeared. Those who starve to death on the road are immediately cut up by people, with blood and flesh everywhere, a sight that cannot be borne. Even digging up graves and corpses, cutting them up and cooking them, is especially tragic. At present, there are still more than three feet of accumulated snow, and it is extremely cold. Without clothes or food, the number of disaster victims freezing and starving to death is estimated to be about five or six hundred people per county per day. They are tearfully begging for extraordinary compassion and quickly providing assistance. They are crying out in blood and eagerly awaiting blessings. The disaster situation is too tragic to read. It is heard that Director Wang of the association, in addition to asking the Beijing association to find ways to provide relief as soon as possible, hopes that kind-hearted people from all walks of life will generously donate, no matter how much or how little, and send it to the nearest Renji Hall on Sixth Malu, which will be collected and remitted to the disaster area to save the remaining lives. The merit is immeasurable.</p>

<p>A Case of Snatching a Widow and Forcing Marriage in Pudong</p>
<p>Zhang Sanjiu Plans to Deceive a Widow</p>
<p>The New Room is Brand New</p>
<p>The Candles and Incense on the Stage are Messy</p>
<p>A Fool's Delight, Many Obstacles to a Good Deed</p>
<p>A case of forcibly taking a bride occurred in Yangjiazhai Tuditang, Pudong, the day before yesterday evening. The victim was a middle-aged woman whose husband had passed away. As a result, both parties were arrested by the authorities. The details are quite amusing. The complete story is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲邂逅一少女 A chance encounter with a young girl. Sun Qiheng, a native of Zhenjiang, is nearly seventy years old and proficient in writing. He was a scholar in the late Qing Dynasty. He married and had children in his hometown, and now his son has grown up and has been married for many days. However, Sun has always been fond of women and considers himself a romantic talent. Although his family is not wealthy, he still thinks of emulating the Qi people's happiness of having one wife and one concubine to enjoy his old age. Therefore, for more than ten years, he has often been looking for beautiful women to achieve his goal. Soon, his wish came true. He met a young girl named Tao, who was only seventeen years old at the time. She had small feet and a beautiful appearance. Sun regarded it as an affair, and his heart was indescribably happy.</p>
<p>▲不容於大婦 Not tolerated by the first wife. After Sun got to know Tao, he developed a relationship with her through friends. Although the girl was young, she did not dislike Sun for being two decades older than her. They were in love with each other. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, Sun took a further step and with the consent of the girl's family, married her as a concubine. However, the first wife saw that her husband was already old and was taking a new mistress, so she was jealous and caused a great domestic disturbance. Sun could not live in peace at home, so he sold half of his family property and led Tao to Shanghai to temporarily avoid her anger, living in the Lanni Du area of Pudong to earn a living.</p>
<p>▲患色癆而死 Died of sexual exhaustion. Unfortunately, Sun's luck was not good. For more than a year, he had no decent job, and his economy gradually became stretched, so that he could not afford food and clothing. He had no choice but to set up a private school to enroll students and make a living by teaching. At the same time, he entrusted someone to recommend his concubine Tao to work in the Longmao Zhan picking flower clothes to supplement his income. For more than ten years, Tao, who is now twenty-nine years old, has still been living with Sun. Recently, Sun was introduced to work as an accountant in the Shenping Garden Teahouse in Huayuan Shiqiao, Pudong. However, Sun loved women as much as his life. He spent his days with young women, so his health deteriorated day by day and he eventually developed tuberculosis. He suddenly became seriously ill and died a few days ago.</p>
<p>▲搶親之怪劇 A bizarre drama of snatching a bride. Sun sacrificed his life due to sexual exhaustion, but his funeral was bleak. Tao cried loudly and was grief-stricken. Sun's friends, seeing this, were moved to pity and raised money to buy a coffin and hastily completed the funeral. And a funny scene of snatching a bride began. However, how the other party who snatched the bride knew Tao's situation and made this move, even when asked his neighbors, he was dumbfounded and could not answer.</p>
<p>▲擁入新房中 Crowded into the new room. There was a Zhang Sanjiu, 34 years old, also a native of Zhenjiang, who runs a hardware store and rents a house in the home of Madam Lei Zhu, the landlady of No. 9 Shisanjian Tou in Yangjiazhai Tuditang, Pudong. He has no wife. Because he loved Tao's beauty and saw that her husband had died, he wanted to marry her as his wife to form a family. So he bought new bedding and set up an incense table in advance. At about 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, he designed to have a woman pretend to be Wang Wenbin, a friend of Sun Qiheng, and call Tao to his house. Tao had just returned from work and believed the words, so she went with the woman. When she arrived at Zhang Sanjiu's door, Zhang forcefully took her into the room. In Zhang's mind, he thought that he had already arranged a spectacular ceremony, forcibly performed the marriage ceremony, and asked a friend to set off firecrackers outside the door. Then he embraced Tao into the new room and let her sit down.</p>
<p>▲好事總難成 Good things are always hard to achieve. As soon as Tao entered the room, she roared loudly, then ran out and overturned the incense table in the hall. Candles and other things were scattered all over the ground. She then entered the room and tried to tear down the wedding curtains. Seeing that Tao was unwilling to comply, Zhang was desperate and locked Tao in the room to prevent her from taking a step beyond the thunder pool, and sent someone to sit in the room to guard her, hoping that Tao could change her mind. Unexpectedly, good things are hard to achieve, and before long, the news spread far and wide. Tao's brother, Tao Huairui, a worker at the Rihua Yarn Factory living at No. 7 Tuditang, was enraged and filed a lawsuit with the Third District Public Security Bureau. The district chief approved the lawsuit and ordered the police to take Zhang Sanjiu, the landlady Lei Zhu, and Tao, who was locked in the room, to the Third District that night. According to Tao's testimony, she was forcibly taken and married. Zhang Sanjiu confessed that he had a relationship with Tao and that she had promised to marry him as his wife after her husband's death, but now the time had come and she had suddenly broken her promise. After verifying the confession, the district chief instructed that Lei Zhu be released because she was not involved, and then transferred them to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>「不怕死」影片　不得在任何國演映</h3>
<p>▲市政府函復市宣傳部</p>
<p>"Undying" Film Not Allowed to Be Shown in Any Country</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Replied to the Municipal Propaganda Department</p>
<p>The sound film "Undying," starring the American actress Roc, which is being shown at the Da Guangming and Guanglu theaters in this city, is set in Chinatown in the United States. It completely depicts Chinese people as thieves, kidnappers, opium traffickers, and other kinds of vile, barbaric, and evil behaviors, insulting Chinese people in every possible way. It has a great impact on our nation's honor and international status. The Municipal Propaganda Department, according to the report of Professor Hong Shen of Fudan University on several ways to ban the film, immediately consulted the Municipal Government for approval. It is now known that the Municipal Government believes that the film clearly insults the Chinese nation and has consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the American ambassador to prohibit the film from being shown in any country. It has also consulted the Ministries of Education and Internal Affairs to order all provinces and cities in the country to investigate and ban the film. The Municipal Government's reply to the Municipal Propaganda Department is recorded as follows: Sirs, we have just received a letter stating that according to Hong Shen's report, the film "Undying" being shown at the Da Guangming Theater has insulted the Chinese nation, and you have proposed five ways to deal with it. After investigating this case, the government previously submitted the same information to the Film Censorship Committee, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already been consulted to negotiate with the American ambassador to prohibit the film from being shown in any country. The Ministries of Education and Internal Affairs have also been consulted to seriously ban the film and order all film censorship agencies in all provinces and cities in the country to investigate and ban it. As for the examination of foreign films shown in the concessions, personnel have also been assigned to negotiate and handle it. In view of the above reasons, we hereby reply to you for your information. Sincerely, to the Propaganda Department of the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<h3>Important News from the Aviation World</h3>
<p>▲ New Transportation Currency Arrived in Tianjin Yesterday The Shanghai Transportation Bank, in order to prevent the alteration of banknotes in the market, specially commissioned the printing of ten million yuan in new paper currency in the United States, divided into three denominations: one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan. Several batches have already arrived. Now, two more batches of new ten-yuan paper currency with a five-color revised version featuring Tianjin place names, totaling 300,000 notes and worth 3 million silver dollars, have arrived in Shanghai. Because these notes need to be transferred to the Tianjin branch for issuance, they were declared for export yesterday and are scheduled to be shipped out tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲ Increased Insurance Premiums for Merchant Ships Transporting Troops Various insurance companies in Shanghai have sent a letter to the Shipping Association, stating that the degree of danger for merchant ships transporting troops is much greater than that of operating regular commercial routes carrying goods and passengers. The companies propose increasing insurance premiums as a way to sustain their business. It is reported that the companies have held multiple meetings and decided to increase the insurance premium by 2.5 mace per hundred taels during the period of troop transport. The Shipping Association has notified all relevant companies to discuss and deliberate on this matter.</p>
<p>▲ Resolution of Ningbo Freight Dispute The various "bangs" (guilds) of Ningbo strongly opposed the increase in cargo handling fees by four companies in Shanghai. With the mediation of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, it is now known that the four companies have negotiated a compromise with the Ningbo merchant guilds, reducing the increase to 20% across the board (originally set at an increase of about 40% from silver to dollars). The Ningbo merchants have expressed their agreement, and the protracted dispute between the two sides has come to an end.</p>
<h3>Da Da Company Continues to Appeal Regarding Waterfront Rights</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Da Da Steamboat Company has repeatedly submitted petitions to the Municipal Government and the Land and Port Bureaus regarding the reorganization of the wharf, requesting the maintenance of the lease contract signed between the former Shanghai City and Township Engineering Bureau and the company. The Municipal Government responded by stating that the case was related to the overall plan for reorganizing the Nanshi wharf line and therefore the request could not be granted. The company, believing that the matter concerned the private rights of the people, has again submitted a petition to the Municipal Government, still requesting the maintenance of the original contract to protect private rights. The original petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition for Maintaining the Waterfront Lease Contract, Requesting Impartial Investigation and Handling to Protect Private Rights. I, the petitioner, hereby submit this petition after receiving your government's instruction No. 631, which stated: "The petition is noted. The company's previous petition did not affix a stamp and this government will not accept it according to law. Regarding the continued petition submitted previously, this case is related to this government's overall plan for reorganizing the Nanshi wharf waterfront line, and the company cannot be treated differently. The request to maintain the original case is difficult to approve." After reading this instruction, I am extremely alarmed.</p>
<p>According to the principle that a contract, once signed, is a right of the people endowed by law, if such private rights are infringed upon without legal procedures, the infringed party may request its removal. Regarding the reasons why the contract should not be changed, I have already explained them clearly in my previous petition. Your government, as the organ for protecting the rights of the people, and even more so as a party to the waterfront lease contract, should absolutely abide by the original case according to law. Now, suddenly, under the pretext of reorganizing the wharf, the valid contract that was legally signed with the petitioner is fundamentally canceled, which seems inappropriate in both law and reason.</p>
<p>I have previously submitted the details of this case to the National Government and received a handwritten instruction from the Chairman: "The submitted document should be handed over to Mayor Zhang for fair investigation and handling." This shows the Chairman's emphasis on the rights of the people. I have presented the original document to the Mayor for the record. Now, based on the previous instruction, for the sake of your government and the sake of private rights, I must reiterate the petitioner's grievances to your government.</p>
<p>The Da Da Steamboat Company, since signing the contract in the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, has filled in mud and built wharves on barren beaches. It only began operations in the first year of the Xuantong reign, after four years of engineering work. The hardships of management are difficult to describe fully. The company suffered losses year after year after opening, and neither company nor official profits have been realized. Only in the past five or six years has the business seemed to have developed slightly, but the profits are still minimal. However, the petitioner has spared no effort in donations for the revolutionary cause and local public welfare. For example, during the Wuchang Uprising and other municipal expenses, the petitioner has made many donations and loans, which can be verified. I hope this will be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>The petitioner has been working diligently for more than 20 years and has only achieved some success today. It is difficult to accept that the contract is being terminated because of the reorganization of the waterfront line. Therefore, I dare to continue this petition, hoping for your review and approval. I hope you will understand the Chairman's intention to advocate for fair investigation and handling, and to emphasize private rights, and approve the maintenance of the original case, and instruct the Land and Port Bureaus to comply, so as to protect private rights. Then the future of public utilities operated by private enterprises will truly depend on this.</p>
<p>I respectfully submit this petition and await your command. Respectfully presented to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government by Wu Zhen, representative of the Shanghai Da Da Steamboat Company, February 27, 1920.</p>
<h3>Use of Autumn Cocoon and Silk Tax in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>▲ Improving Sericulture in Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>The General Association of Silk and Cocoon of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces is currently continuing to strive for the exemption of taxes on autumn cocoons and silk in the inland areas. However, the autumn cocoons produced in Wuxi and other places last year, excluding those transported to treaty ports, were still subject to normal taxation by various tax offices when the autumn cocoon silk reeled in the inland areas was transported out. This tax revenue is substantial. As the improvement of sericulture requires considerable funds, if the cocoon tax collected in Jiangsu Province is used to improve sericulture in Jiangsu, it would be consistent with the facts. Inland silk and cocoon merchants have sincerely petitioned the Jiangsu Department of Agriculture and Mines to forward it to the government for implementation. It is now known that Director He has submitted it to the Central Government and forwarded it to the Political Affairs Conference for resolution, consulting with the Ministry of Finance to allocate all of the inland autumn cocoon and silk tax collected last autumn to the Jiangsu Province for improvement expenses. An order has been issued to the special commissioner of finance of Jiangsu Province to allocate the funds accordingly.</p>

<h3>National Federation of Commerce and Industry Asks to Protect Commercial Operations</h3>
<p>The Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China recently received telegrams from the Linhai and Sheng County Chambers of Commerce in Zhejiang Province, both of which were illegally interfered with by the local government and party headquarters. The Federation telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Headquarters yesterday, asking them to find ways to stop it. The two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Please Stop the County Government from Setting Up Another Preparatory Office for Reorganization Hangzhou, Zhejiang Provincial Government, Construction Department, Linhai County Government, Linhai County Chamber of Commerce, all informed: Recently, the Linhai County Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram stating that the Chamber is reorganizing regularly in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law, but was illegally prevented by the County Government from approving it, and another preparatory committee for reorganization was set up, which was manipulated by a few treacherous merchants who monopolized the election and committed fraud. Please telegraph the Provincial Government to order the dissolution, etc. According to Article 19 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Chamber of Commerce Law, when the Chamber of Commerce should be reorganized or re-elected according to law, the current staff should be responsible for handling it. The reorganization of the Linhai County Chamber of Commerce in accordance with the law is inherently unobjectionable, and the County Government should not prevent it. It is even more illegal to set up another preparatory committee for reorganization and handle it by a few merchants. The Provincial Government and the Construction Department should order the County Government to dissolve the Preparatory Office for the Reorganization of the Chamber of Commerce and be responsible for handling the reorganization by the current staff of the County Chamber of Commerce in accordance with Article 19 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Chamber of Commerce Law. If the County Chamber of Commerce handles the reorganization illegally, the County Government should supervise and guide it to comply with laws and regulations and maintain commercial operations. I still hope for a telegram reply. I am very grateful. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, etc. are grateful and printed.</p>
<p>▲ Please Stop Illegal Interference with the Sheng County Chamber of Commerce Zhejiang Provincial Government, Provincial Party Headquarters, and Construction Department are informed. The All-Province Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Sheng County Government, and the County Chamber of Commerce are informed. Recently, the Sheng County Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram stating that according to the newly promulgated Chamber of Commerce Law and its detailed rules for implementation, the establishment and reorganization of the Chamber of Commerce only need to be reported to the主管官署 (competent authority). Our Chamber was ordered to reorganize and submitted it to the County Party Executive Committee to guide the scene. However, after the reorganization, the County Party Headquarters put forward serious conditions, such as the Chamber of Commerce cannot hold meetings without the participation of party members, all resolutions must be sent to the Party Headquarters for review, and the work must be reported weekly in accordance with its guidance plan, etc. Judging from its intention, if the Chamber of Commerce is within the scope stipulated by the Chamber of Commerce Law, it cannot be free at all. The Chamber of Commerce is subject to this restriction and cannot exert its entire will, which is not the original intention of the legislation. Please quickly telegraph the province to stop it for compliance. Sincerely, the Sheng County Chamber of Commerce, with seal, etc. Although the Chamber of Commerce should be guided by the Party Headquarters, the power of supervision lies entirely with the主管官署 (competent authority). The Chamber of Commerce Law has clearly stipulated that, even in accordance with the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Third Executive Committee of the Central Government, only non-regular meetings should be reported to the Party Headquarters in advance. If, as stipulated by the Sheng County Party Headquarters, party members must participate in all Chamber of Commerce meetings, resolutions must be sent to the Party Headquarters for review, and work must be reported weekly in accordance with its guidance plan, it is outside the law and the power of the party. The Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Headquarters should immediately issue a clear order to stop it, and the County Government should handle it in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law and its detailed rules for implementation. Illegal interference will never be accepted, and the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce should immediately send a telegram to all chambers of commerce in the province for reference to maintain the rule of law and strengthen commercial operations. A thousand prayers.</p>
<h3>Provisional Measures for Suppressing Company Fundraising</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has received instructions from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, No. 商字8561, stating that my country has never had definite suppression measures for merchants to initiate and organize limited liability companies to raise funds, which has led to occasional situations in which people falsely use fundraising as a name to set up bureaus to deceive, etc. It should be strictly suppressed to prevent loopholes. Now, the Ministry has formulated eight provisional measures for suppressing the fundraising of limited liability companies. In the future, all merchants who initiate and organize limited liability companies should abide by these measures. In addition to publishing a notice in the newspaper, the Bureau will also inform the Chamber of Commerce to instruct merchants in all industries to comply. A copy of the provisional measures for company fundraising will be reprinted so that those who establish companies can request it. The provisional measures for company fundraising are recorded below:</p>
<p>Article 1: When establishing a limited liability company, a business plan, the names and resumes of the initiators, and the number of shares subscribed should be prepared first, together with the prospectus. The initiators should sign their names and submit it to the competent authority for record before starting fundraising.</p>
<p>Article 2: When presenting the establishment of a limited liability company, the name "Preparatory Office of a Certain Company" should be used externally before the company is formally established.</p>
<p>Article 3: When the local competent authority approves the fundraising, the fundraising period should be appropriately limited. If the amount is insufficient after the deadline, it will be invalid, but if there are special circumstances, the reasons may be stated and submitted for extension.</p>
<p>Article 4: The funds received for shares or subscription deposits may not be withdrawn by the initiators before the company is formally established.</p>
<p>Article 5: When the company's share capital is fully raised and an inaugural meeting is held, the local competent authority should send personnel to supervise the scene. The record of the inaugural meeting should also be signed and certified by the supervising personnel.</p>
<p>Article 6: After a company is approved to raise funds, if it stops fundraising for any reason, it must be concluded within ten days, reported to the competent authority for record, and the received funds must be returned in full. All preparatory expenses shall be borne jointly and severally by the initiators.</p>
<p>Article 7: When establishing a company, each initiator must subscribe for at least one-fifth of the total share capital, and each initiator must subscribe for at least three percent of the total share capital.</p>
<p>Article 8: Before the establishment of the company, all expenses required for the establishment shall be paid in advance by the initiators and submitted to the inaugural meeting for resolution and borne by the company.</p>

<h3>Tools for Implementing Mongolian and Tibetan Education</h3>
<p>▲The Beiping Library has submitted duplicate copies of Mongolian books.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to implement Mongolian and Tibetan education, previously solicited Mongolian and Tibetan books for reference. Now, Yuan Tongli, Deputy Director of the Beiping Library, has submitted a document to the Ministry of Education stating: "Regarding the submission of duplicate copies of Mongolian books and book lists, as per Instruction No. 23 dated January 13th, the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Department of this Ministry has just been established and urgently needs various books and records for reference. Beiping is the cultural center of our country, with extremely rich collections of books. This library is the only repository encompassing ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign books. You are hereby ordered to examine all duplicate Mongolian and Tibetan books in the library and send them to the Ministry for application. Those without duplicates may also list the titles, prices, and places of publication in detail for purchase." In compliance with this instruction, we have examined all duplicate Mongolian and Tibetan books in the library and purchased several others, compiling a list for your inspection and receipt. Separate lists have also been compiled for those without duplicates and those not yet purchased based on investigations, which are also submitted for your review. All reasons for submitting duplicate Mongolian and Tibetan books and book lists in compliance with the order are respectfully submitted for your consideration. Attached books include: "San Min Zhuyi in Mongolian and Chinese," "New Novel," "Mongolian and Chinese Five-Directional Original Sounds," "Mongolian and Chinese Dictionary," "Mongolian Classified Dictionary," "Biography of Genghis Khan," "Conversations of Genghis Khan," "Mongolian Dictionary," "Imperially Ordered Rhyme System of Shared Scripts," "Expanded Rewards of the Three Harmonies Sacred Edict," "Essentials of Governance of the Three Harmonies," "Four-Script Harmony," "Three Harmonies Handbook," and fourteen other types. Also, a list of Mongolian and Tibetan books currently held by the library is enclosed, which contains various valuable books on Mongolian and Tibetan history and biographies."</p>
<h3>The Capital's Mongolian and Tibetan School Funding Has Been Determined</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission jointly submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to establish remedial schools to accommodate Mongolian and Tibetan students, and requested approval to allocate a monthly subsidy of 1,484 yuan with an attached budget, requesting approval and an order for allocation. On the 27th, the Ministry of Education received an instruction from the Executive Yuan stating: "The submitted report and budget have been fully noted. This case has been submitted to the 59th meeting of this Yuan and resolved according to the proposal, ordering the Ministry of Finance to allocate the funds accordingly. You are hereby instructed to take note and forward this to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for their information. These orders and budget reports are stored and forwarded separately." It is heard that the capital is urgently establishing a Mongolian and Tibetan remedial school because Tibet is divided into the Front Tibet and the Rear Tibet (the Front Tibet is called the Dalai, the Rear Tibet is called the Panchen). The residents of the Rear Tibet are oppressed and have few opportunities to study, and they are forced to go to India to study English, which is not free and does not allow them to receive Chinese culture. The Mongolian and Tibetan remedial school is established behind the Zhengjue Temple on Lilang Street in Nanjing (serving as a reception and accommodation center, so its expenses are higher than ordinary day schools). There are currently more than 20 students, the youngest being 11 years old and the oldest being 20 years old. It is also heard that there are 60 oppressed people from the Rear Tibet who are already on their way to the capital. The school will soon have 80 students.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education is Preparing a Pilot Zone for Free Education in the Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>▲Qin Fengxiang and Ruan Zhidao are in charge of preparations</p>
<p>Chen Mengzhao, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, has recently been working hard to promote compulsory education. In addition to hiring Wu Zhihui, Zhu Jingnong, and others to serve as members of the Free Education Committee to plan the direction of free education throughout the province, and ordering all counties to continue collecting the general education mu tax within the limited amount of land price at the original tax rate, he has also recently decided to establish a pilot zone for free education in Zhenjiang, the political center of Jiangsu Province. The number of school-age children is increasing daily, and the Ministry of Education has set a plan to establish 3,000 pilot zones for compulsory education nationwide within five years. Jiangsu, as a province leading in education, should actively prepare to set an example for other provinces. The department has already appointed Qin Fengxiang and Ruan Zhidao, officials of the department, as preparatory members for the pilot zone. Yang Naikang, Director of the Second Division, is also working hard on everything. Qin has served in Jiangsu's educational administration for many years, and his footprints have covered all counties. He previously served as a specialist inspector of the former Department of Education and a commissioner for compulsory education in the Central University District. He has unique insights into local education, and Qin contributed greatly to the implementation of the general education mu tax in Jiangsu. Ruan is steadfast and hardworking, having studied in England for many years. He previously served as the director of the Fengxian Education Bureau, and both are gaining recognition. The two are now in the vicinity of the Zhenjiang County Education Bureau, establishing a preparatory office, and asking Director Han, Supervisor Li, and Commissioner Zhao of the bureau to assist in the process. Other staff members will be temporarily assigned by the Department of Education. Once the budget is established, a formal organization will be established. Currently, preparations are underway to delineate the district boundaries, investigate school children, and prepare the existing primary schools for a comprehensive implementation, without simplifying or hastily proceeding due to limitations.</p>
<h3>The Department of Education Orders Monthly Reporting of Accounting Books</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an order to all schools and social education institutions: "In compliance with the matter, it has been found that the format of the accounting statements submitted by various institutions in the past is not uniform, and the timing of submission varies. Furthermore, because the budget had not been established previously, the budget columns in the books were not filled in with numbers. This long-term divergence is not only a violation of the Audit Council's regulations, but also makes it difficult for this department to comprehensively review and verify. The Audit Council has now issued new formats for various accounting books and statements, and sample copies have been printed and distributed for compliance. Furthermore, the estimated total amount of operating expenses for various institutions for this year has also been approved and notified. It is urgently notified that everyone must take note. Starting from the beginning of the year, which is this July, the accounting books and statements that should be submitted monthly must be prepared in accordance with the newly issued formats, and after being reviewed by the audit committee along with the voucher storage books, they should be submitted to the department for verification. There must be no delays or mistakes. This is of utmost importance." This order.</p>

<h3>Far East Games Baseball Match: Overseas Chinese Return to Assist in Battle</h3>
<p>▲ Japan Sports Association Declares</p>
<p>▲ Only Seven Have Agreed to Return</p>
<p>Japan has long been dominant in East Asia when it comes to baseball tactics. At each Far East Games, our country has repeatedly lost to Japan in baseball matches. Therefore, our country is no match for the Japanese. The reason the Japanese are skilled at baseball is because they emphasize baseball practice and have a fondness for it. Moreover, the Japanese love baseball like the Chinese love soccer. For this upcoming Games, our country deeply regrets not having suitable athletes to participate. Many are pessimistic about the upcoming baseball competition. According to the Japan Sports Association, the honorary chairman of the Far East Games, Mr. Wang Zhengting, recognizing that there are no baseball players skilled in baseball within China, has specially sent invitations to the Honolulu Overseas Chinese Baseball Team, inviting them to return to the country to assist in the battle. The team has a total of fifteen strong players, whose record has surpassed that of the entire United States. However, eight of them have indicated that they cannot return to the country, with only seven feeling sympathy for the motherland. This matter is currently under negotiation. As for their travel expenses and other costs for returning to the country, Honorary Chairman Wang has already undertaken to bear them, deeply hoping that all the strong players can return to assist in the battle, to increase the glory of the motherland.</p>
<h3>National Games</h3>

<p>▲ Chairman's Report: The chairman first delivered an opening speech, stating that Vice Director Zhou was in Shanghai on official business, so he would be acting as chairman on his behalf. The association's period is only one month, and from March 16th to 18th, the Zhejiang Provincial Games will be held, requiring the use of the association's venue. Therefore, our work seems even more urgent. Here is a brief report on the progress of the previous week's resolutions: (1) The candidates for the various committees organized in the previous resolution are still under consideration and will be announced after a decision is made. (2) Matters related to promotion have been assigned to the General Affairs Section and are already in progress. (3) The emblem, badges, tickets, etc., have been submitted by Vice Director Zhou to Vice President Zhang for a decision. (4) In terms of transportation, Wang Yuandao and Mr. Wu Liang are in contact with the Railway Bureau and China Travel Service. (5) In terms of competition, the rules and methods have been drafted and decided. (6) In terms of construction, progress is quite rapid, and completion is expected soon. As for matters that urgently need to be carried out currently, such as editing the Games Handbook, planning the athletes' and staff's dormitories and meals, venue layout, on-site vendors, photography, and guest reception, etc., how to decide on these matters requires our joint discussion. ▲ Reports from Various Sections: (1) Yu Shifan, Chief Engineer of the Construction Section, reported on behalf of the section that the A and B grandstands were originally scheduled to be completed by February 28th, but due to heavy snow last year, there would be a delay of a few days. The macadam road can be completed in one week. The athletic track was originally scheduled to be completed on February 10th but will also be delayed by a few days due to rain and snow. The new surrounding wall and gate were originally scheduled to be completed on February 25th and will now be delayed until March 10th. The repair of the old surrounding wall has been completed. Five tennis courts are scheduled to be completed on March 13th, with two of them completed by March 10th. The movable flooring is scheduled to be completed before March 9th. Bathrooms are scheduled to be completed on March 13th. Ticket booths, bamboo fences, and toilets are all scheduled to be completed on March 13th. The leveling of the athletic field and soccer field can be completed within one week. The baseball field and other fields can be completed within one week. (2) Mr. Wu, Clerk of the General Affairs Section, reported: 1. The emblem will be decided by Director Zhu upon his return to Hangzhou. 2. Vendors and snack shops will be built by the association according to the prescribed format, and it will be convenient to invite merchants to contract. 3. Catering will be contracted out to someone, and negotiations are currently underway. 4. Due to insufficient rooms in the association, separate housing should be found for female athletes. 5. If merchants are contracted for packaging, dismantling, and installation of electric lights, each lamp will cost 65 to 70 cents, totaling about 100 yuan. 6. The style of discount certificates for train and boat rides has been drafted, using triplicate forms, with one copy for the association's record, one copy for the athletes to keep, and one copy for exchanging tickets at the Railway Bureau or Shipping Bureau. 7. The ticket matter has been submitted to Vice President Zhang and has not yet been returned. 8. Regarding promotion, the Games Handbook is being edited by Mr. Wu Jianying, and preparations are being made to solicit advertisements. It is planned to be printed before March 10th and published on the 20th. To facilitate printing and proofreading, it is advisable to print it in Hangzhou. The Italian Printing Bureau previously contacted in Shanghai should be sent a letter of rejection. In addition to some advertisements that can be published in the Handbook, the rest will be published in the Games Daily. Regarding news promotion, a separate promotion team has been organized to handle it, promoting the association's news in Hangzhou widely every day. The promotion team also plans to set up editing, advertising, news recording, translation, and photography sections to handle their respective tasks. (3) Mr. Wu, Clerk of the Competition Section, reported on the section's past progress, stating that all previously drafted competition items, methods, etc., have been printed and distributed to various provinces. Most of the competition rules are based on the latest rules of the Far East Games. In women's track and field, only the javelin throwing rule is not available in the Far East Games, so it has been drafted independently and will be submitted to the Regulations Committee for review and addition. There are also many additions and revisions to other competition rules to adapt to the needs of this Games. They have now been printed and sent to the members of the Regulations Committee for review. He added that there has been considerable contact with the sports circles of various provinces and cities, but there is no news from overseas Chinese groups. According to indirectly obtained information, the overseas Chinese in Singapore plan to send athletes to the Games. The association has sent a telegram to inform them and enclosed the competition items and methods. As for matters to be carried out hereafter, the candidates for various committees are being considered, and they will be announced and appointed separately as soon as Vice Director Zhou makes a decision. The list of referees is also under consideration, with 70 to 80 people already in mind. He asked everyone to suggest more. However, how to stipulate the referees' accommodation (such as travel and meals) is still pending for public decision. (4) Mr. Yu Jimin, Security Officer, reported that the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau can send 80 police officers daily to maintain order at the venue in shifts in the morning and afternoon.</p>
<p>▲ Discussion Items: (1) It is proposed to hire Lai Gang, Commander of the Third Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Security Corps, as a consultant for the association.

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Wife (to Chinese Cook): Have</p>
<p>you seen my new hat? I forgot it in the kitchen when I came back just now to pay the driver. Chinese Cook: Madam, I haven't seen it. Foreign Wife: What? I put it on the half-table near the back door. The hat has many green leaves on it.</p>
<p>Chinese Cook: Oh dear. I thought it was some kind of vegetable that madam bought back and put in the pot to cook. ▲ Female A: Why do you, a rich family lady with a good life, need to marry?</p>
<p>Female B: I'm afraid of thieves at night and very timid sleeping in bed alone.</p>
<p>▲ Doctor: Should I take an X-ray of your husband to see his lungs?</p>
<p>Woman: No need. I've been married to him for twenty years. I already know his lungs and liver.</p>
<p>▲ A: The thing I cherish most in my life is a gold watch left by my late father.</p>

<h3>A Tragic Account of the Taiwan Disaster</h3>
<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>My friend Zhu Wu Die went to Taiwan last winter to help with disaster relief. He recently recounted the details of the disaster, which left me deeply uneasy. I have summarized the tragic situation to inform my compatriots who share my concern.</p>
<p>▲ Three Types of Food: The severity of the Taiwan disaster is</p>
<p>already well-known to readers. The coarseness and inferiority of the so-called three types of food can be imagined. 1. The highest-grade food is bran. When eating it, it is like feeding pigs and cattle, simply boiled in water. Therefore, many people die from bloating after eating bran. 2. The middle-grade food is wild water chestnuts. This grows naturally in the fields. Normally, farmers hate it because it hinders the growth of rice. Unexpectedly, in a famine year, it is regarded as the ultimate delicacy. People regret that it doesn't grow more. The method of eating it is to first chop the water chestnuts with the peel, then grind them finely and boil them. Because it's with the peel, the color is purple. This thing is very similar to water chestnuts but smaller, no bigger than the thickness of a thumb. 3. The lowest-grade food is the root of foxtail grass. It is also ground into powder and cooked into a糊-like paste to eat. It tastes slightly bitter.</p>
<p>▲ Straw Raincoats as Blankets: Most disaster victims use straw raincoats as blankets. At first, I thought it was the custom of the poor people there. After inquiring, I learned that because they had nothing to eat after the disaster, they had already pawned everything in the pawnshop to exchange for money to prolong their lives. Therefore, they used tools for rain protection as substitutes for items to resist the cold.</p>
<p>▲ Tragic News of Selling Daughters: Disaster victims with young wives and daughters often take their wives and daughters to other places to sell when they have no other choice. A disaster victim in Dongyang Xia Ban Zhuang, because his wife was pregnant and about to give birth, had no money for delivery and raising children. Since his only daughter was already grown up, he had to discuss it with his wife and take his daughter to Ningbo to sell her to meet urgent needs. Unfortunately, the times were unlucky, and he was only able to sell her after staying for more than a month. Although he obtained more than 120 silver dollars, after paying off the room and board fees, there was little left. When he arrived home, he only had a few dollars and cents left. The husband and wife met and cried for the whole day, wanting to seek death.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they were dissuaded by others.</p>
<h3>Recording the Public Memorial Service for Master Mingjue by Shanghai Gentlemen</h3>
<p>— Ting Bing Sheng</p>
<p>In February of the nineteenth year of the Republic, Shanghai gentry and merchants gathered</p>
<p>at the Baoben Hall in the British Concession to set up a memorial service, with over two hundred people attending the memorial service for Abbot Mingjue of Mount Putuo. The grand occasion has been reported in various newspapers, and the plain walls of the Buddhist hall were covered with elegiac couplets, with many excellent works for reference. Throughout the past five thousand years, this is the only monk who has received such posthumous honor and glory in the Buddhist community. Wang Yiting's elegiac couplet says, "First fulfilled the karmic ties of the previous life, planting the Bodhi tree at sixty," "Now attesting to the fruit of this life, smiling and plucking the Udumbara flower," which is particularly concise and appropriate. Yu Youren's elegiac couplet says, "The moon in Wujiang reflects the Bodhi tree," "The clouds of Luoshui return to the head-touching pine," which are both excellent writings. Furthermore, Dihuan's couplet says, "Entering Buddhism from Confucianism, merging the false with the true, hoping to forever be a compassionate ferry for all, who would have expected that both shores would not be inhabited and return to eternal silence," "The suddenness is secluded and strange, difficult to describe in words, only hoping to be a leader of famous mountains for a long time, who would have known that the six perfections would freely attest to the lotus land," although the antithesis is not entirely perfect, it is closely related to the Abbot's previous career and deserves praise. Moreover, Lianxi, the retired Abbot of Puji Temple,</p>
<p>'s elegiac couplet says, "Has your Holiness finally returned? The Pure Land of the Lotus Land is worthy of entrusting your feet,"</p>
<p>"I am also old, who will shoulder the responsibility of famous mountains and Buddhist lands?" which inevitably flows into words of lamentation and self-pity. That day, I participated in the memorial service and vaguely heard that the Abbot's secular son, Xiang Guoging, rushed to the mountain to attend the funeral last year, his face full of dust, unable to bear the sorrow, and able to carry on his father's will, donating funds for charity. The residents of the Mount Putuo area all benefited from his virtue. Mr. Xiang also said that his late father, Mingjue, had converted to Buddhism for ten years, and his achievements in building and cultivating virtue were too numerous to mention. For example, the creation and renovation of the Ruyi Lodge on Mount Putuo and the establishment of the Amitabha Hall were all done with painstaking effort, fully mobilizing donations, taking years and costing tens of thousands, and his late father did not spare himself the slightest effort. Furthermore, due to the lack of annual expenses and medical expenses, even at the time of his death, he still looked around and said, "I wish my Buddhist disciples to exhaust their efforts, creating a career to help the poor and the helpless, then my heart will be at ease." Therefore, I, as a thorny person, to embody the heart of my parents, am willing to donate 3,500 yuan, to be preserved in the temple treasury, as medicine expenses for the sick, in order to maintain it permanently and continue the aspirations of my predecessors. His words are also worthy of deep thought.</p>
<h3>A Record of a World City</h3>
<p>— Fang Shenan</p>
<p>Mr. Liu, an overseas Chinese, suffered a stroke two years ago. He went to Paris, London, and other places for medical treatment but to no avail. He returned to China last autumn and consulted me. After a few days, his speech became clear, and he was very interested. Every time he came to my residence for acupuncture, he spoke freely about the customs of Saigon, with things I had never heard of. I write it down as a strange story.</p>
<p>The neighbor of Saigon, named Khmer, is a French colony. It is more than 450 kilometers from Saigon. (Every 1,000 yards is one kilometer.) It takes two days to reach by tram from Saigon. There are two ancient cities in the middle, one named Angkor Wat and the other named Angkor Thom (pronounced Tun). The two cities are very close to each other. The circumference of the two cities is dozens of miles, and the height is dozens of feet. They are all built with huge stones of more than ten feet square. The stones are engraved with figures in ancient costumes, strange-looking birds and beasts, and exotic flowers and plants. The workmanship of the engravings is by no means the work of ordinary hands. According to an engineer from Flower Flag, it would take 200,000 people 200 years to build them. The money cannot be estimated. There are also many projects that cannot be built by machines and humans. The natives in the city wear yellow clothes and deeply believe in Buddhism, chanting scriptures and incantations. When this city began has been lost to research. After Angkor Wat was completed, there were many small pagodas in the city. The engravings on the city walls are extremely meticulous. The workmanship of Angkor Thom is also very meticulous. However, there is a large pagoda in the city. When the work was about to be completed, the sky was already bright. There is still a hole missing in the city wall, which remains as it is today. The French used cement to fill it, but it came off in an instant. The city has two large hostels built by the French for tourists to stay in. There are also Chinese who run small businesses in the city. The rights to protect the relics of this city now belong to the French. According to world travelers, this city is truly the first in the world.</p>
<h3>Continuing the Record of the Tiger in Xixiang, Zhuji</h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>A Wang surname hunter from Huangjiahu Village, Shisandu, Xixiang, my county (Zhuji), recently hunted a giant tiger and transported it to Hangzhou for sale. This matter has been detailed in various newspapers and this publication. Now, my nephew has just returned from the village to Shanghai. Yesterday, he visited my humble home and talked vividly, saying that he personally saw the giant tiger being carried into the city by many people. At that time, he also heard the hunters describe the hunting situation. The report was quite different, and the matter was quite interesting. Therefore, I continue to record it. The Wang surname brothers, A, B, and C, usually engage in hunting in addition to farming. On the evening of the ninth day of the first lunar month, around 10 PM, everyone had already fallen asleep. Mrs. A was sleeping alone in a room downstairs. The door of the room was not closed. Mrs. A suddenly felt the bed shaking. She woke up in great shock, suspecting that a burglar was hiding under the bed. She quickly put on her clothes and got out of bed, rushing out the door. She did not dare to go upstairs by herself, so she first went to a neighbor's house for help, saying that there was a thief in the room and calling everyone to get up. Then, she climbed over the wall and looked in from the outside through the window. What was squatting on the bed was actually a giant tiger. Everyone then climbed upstairs and poked holes in the floorboards, shooting down with guns. The tiger was shot in the waist. The tiger roared in pain, and the roof tiles shook. Everyone was trembling. Then, they saw it was silent. They then went into the room together. It weighed more than 800 catties. Its eyes were not closed, and it still had the energy of a tiger. It was then transported to Hangzhou and sold to Hu Qing Yu Tang. According to those experienced in hunting, the tiger must be 75 years old. It can truly be called an old tiger. According to the tiger's entry into the people's house, why not look for people to devour? Since seeing the woman get out of bed, why not harm her? After the woman left, why did she then sit on the bed? It is also very strange.</p>
<p>My nephew also said that in Beixiang, Yidu, Zhuji, during the heavy snow last year, a gorilla was hunted. It was as big as a fifteen- or sixteen-year-old child. There were four hunters at the time. Seeing the gorilla trapped in the snow, they planned to shoot it. The gorilla quickly shook its hands, making a pleading gesture, so it surrendered and was bound. It was imprisoned in a room, and its claws were cut off, and several of its incisors were knocked out. It is now planned to sell it for a good price.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes About Cigarettes</h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>Cigarettes have almost become a universal habit among our countrymen. I too am fond of them, smoking about twenty a day, day in and day out, for ten years. Fortunately, I prefer domestic brands, so the money hasn't flowed out of the country. Over the years, I've heard and seen quite a few amusing stories about cigarettes, so I'm recording a couple to tell the readers.</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, there was a Zhou family. One day, a fellow villager came to visit. They offered tea and cigarettes, proper etiquette observed. They chatted for a while, and then it was time for lunch. The host brought out the dishes, with wine and food, all arranged perfectly. He invited the guest to sit down. At that moment, the guest had a cigarette in hand, not yet half-smoked. Seeing no place to put it on the table, and feeling it a pity to throw it away, he removed the ashes and put it in his pocket before taking his seat. The host didn't notice. When the meal was half over, a wisp of clear smoke began to emerge from the guest's collar. The guest, of course, didn't realize it. The host didn't think much of it either. Before long, the smoke grew thicker. The guest, with the delicious food before him, only knew to wolf down his meal and didn't realize the spark that was igniting right under his nose. The host called out to him, and then he finally realized it. He quickly took off his coat, and indeed, the embers of the cigarette had reignited, and the remaining ash was still smoldering. A hole was already clearly visible in the coat. Who knew that taking off the coat would create a breeze, and the fur lining of his leather robe suddenly burst into flames. The guest was caught off guard, horrified, and began to jump around wildly. The host also shouted and, spotting a basin of water on a nearby table, grabbed it and poured it on the guest. The guest stopped jumping after the cold water was poured over his head, and the fire was extinguished. However, a large patch of white fur now resembled purple lamb. Later, the host provided clothes for the guest to change into before he could rejoin the table and continue eating.</p>
<p>There was also a certain professor in Shanghai who was very fond of cigarettes. Except when he was lecturing in the classroom, he almost always had one lit. After the Double Tenth Festival last year, he suddenly stopped smoking. Those who knew him were puzzled. When asked the reason, he sighed and said, "I almost caused a disaster because of it. One day, I was at school, and the bell for class had already rung. I happened to receive a letter from home, about an urgent matter that needed an immediate reply. I quickly leaned over my desk to write, and my cigarette craving came on. In my haste, I tossed the burning match behind me and quickly went back to writing. Who knew that before I finished my letter, a fire had already started behind me. The bedding had fallen to the floor, and the match had landed on it, causing it to catch fire. I quickly threw down my pen and tried to put it out. In my panic, I only knew to frantically beat at the fire with my hands, not thinking to call for help. But what could one pair of hands do? In a short time, half of the bedding had burned, and the fire spread to the blanket. Dense smoke billowed out of the window. People outside shouted, and the police blew their whistles. School workers brought four buckets of water, and the fire was finally stopped. When the smoke cleared, I woke up as if from a dream and saw that both my hands were charred black. I felt an intense pain and rushed to the hospital, where it took ten days to heal. Since that incident, I've hated cigarettes like scorpions and vowed never to smoke again."</p>
<h3>Tidbits of Common Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Tang Bihua</p>
<p>When first making friends, you need to know their temperament. Just play a round of mahjong with them, and you can immediately understand their temper. Whether they are worth befriending will become clear at a glance.</p>
<p>Do not take the five-colored leaflets being handed out on the streets if they are reactionary slogans distributed by the Communist Party. You might be seen by a detective and suspected of being a Communist, especially in the Chinese areas. Be even more careful.</p>
<p>Friends who are new to Shanghai, when walking on the street and encountering police officers conducting searches, do not panic. Maintain a calm demeanor, raise both arms, and allow them to search you. Do not try to escape, or the police might misunderstand you as a criminal and start shooting, which could be fatal.</p>
<p>If you unfortunately encounter a burglary at home and it is difficult to call the police, if you have electric lights, you can remove a light bulb and throw it on the ground. The loud crash will scare the burglar away. It is best to throw it from upstairs, as the sound will be even louder. This method has already been tried and proven very effective. However, do not shout loudly for help, as that could be life-threatening.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (138)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Famous Gentlemen Clamor and Play Hide-and-Seek, A Charming Maiden Supports with Affection</p>
<p>She lives that kind of monotonous life every day. She really wants to find a way to steal some free time to go out and play for an evening. But unfortunately, her nominal mother, who is actually the great aunt who owns her, watches over her and doesn't allow her any time to go out and play. She has also learned to play mahjong and is eager to try, but no one pays attention to her. Zuo Shichen saw people playing cards and felt bored, so he called Ruiyun over. Ruiyun saw people playing cards and asked Shichen, "Why aren't you playing cards?" Shichen said, "I don't like playing cards, and I'm not very good at it either." Ruiyun said, "Next time, let me join in for a round. If you don't like playing, you can sing for customers, and I'll play for you. I've been playing mahjong pretty well lately." Shichen saw that she looked very happy, so he said, "Okay, next time, let me join in for a round, and I'll call you to help me go out." Sure enough, there were one or two times when there were small wins and losses, and Shichen sat down. At the same time, he wrote a ticket to call her over. When she saw Shichen playing cards, she jumped up with joy and said, "Let's go, let's go, let me play!" Shichen immediately stood up, but she grabbed him and said, "You sit next to me and watch me play, but you're not allowed to say anything, you're not allowed to interfere with me." Shichen obediently sat next to her. Sometimes, as soon as she sat down, she would win several hands in a row. Her joyous and triumphant expression was truly flamboyant and arrogant. It's a pity that she hadn't even played three hands when tickets began to fly in like snowflakes. The servant standing at the doorway stretched his throat and shouted, "Little Miss, someone is asking for a singing performance from Zhang's family, Wang's family, Zhao's family, Li's family..." She was focused on the cards and didn't pay attention to him. In less than ten minutes, the servant came to urge her again. She scolded, "Damn singing performances, you have to let me win a hand before I leave. Ah Jin persuaded, "Miss, if you delay your singing performance, the Great Aunt will scold even me. Let's go and come back later." Zuo Shichen also said, "If you like to play cards, I'll come to your business tomorrow and play small mahjong with you, for copper coins. Either during the day, or at night, after you've finished your singing performances." She was happy again and said, "Really? Let's go today!" Zuo Shichen said, "Isn't it too late today?" Ruiyun said, "It's not too late, it's not too late, we must go today!" Ah Jin, who also liked to play mahjong, said, "Young Master, you probably have things to do during the day. It would be best if you come at night." Ruiyun said, "Let's go do the singing performances and come back. If he doesn't go, we'll drag him along!" Sure enough, after she went everywhere to do her singing performances, she didn't call her back again. She hopped and skipped over again, dragging Zuo Shichen away as if he were an escort. As soon as she arrived home, she started yelling and jumping, like a little sparrow, opening the table and scattering the tiles, proudly saying to Zuo Shichen, "Today, I must win ten dollars from you!" At this time, the Great Aunt didn't really approve either. Her idea was that it would be best if Zuo Shichen invited a few friends to come and play big mahjong, where one hand could win twelve dollars. What's the point of small mahjong?</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Silver Dollar Trading Heavy at Month End</p>
<p>▲ Market Overview: Yesterday was the last day of February in the Western calendar. The silver dollar transactions and settlements in the financial world seemed busier than usual. However, the supply and demand in the premium market were balanced, and the prices did not change much. Money was surprisingly loose, remaining as before. Therefore, although transactions and settlements were both booming, there was no hope for a turnaround in the market sentiment. The situation of subsidiary currency was also unchanged.</p>
<p>▲ Premium and Discount Prices: The "foreign premium" opened at 7 qian 2 fen 0 hao 1 hu 2.5 si in the morning, appearing to fall 3 hao 7 hu 5 si compared to the opening price of the previous day. However, the afternoon market slightly recovered 1 hao 2 hu 5 si, reaching 7 qian 2 fen 0 hao 2.5 si. The situation fluctuated and lacked significant movement. Both the morning and afternoon interbank lending rates for "silver discounts" were generally borrowed at par, and the same was true for transactions in small associations. The looseness of the silver market can be imagined.</p>
<p>▲ Subsidiary Currency Market Conditions: Jiangnan small silver dollars opened at 6 qian 1 fen in the morning, slightly higher by 1 li compared to the previous day, with 4,000 jiao traded. The afternoon market declined again to 6 qian 0 fen 8 li 5 hao, falling 1 li 5 hao compared to the morning market, with 2,500 jiao traded. Guangdong small silver dollars were at 5 qian 9 fen 4 li 1 hao 2.5 si in the morning and 5 qian 9 fen 4 li 3 hao 7.5 si in the afternoon, with a difference of 2.5 hao between the two markets. Transactions: 155,000 jiao in the morning and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins remained at 400 qian, plus 4,000 cash.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Inflows and Outflows: Yesterday, due to the end-of-month settlement, various settlements seemed busier. Chinese merchants had settlement tickets worth 2.3 to 2.4 million yuan, foreign merchants had more than 1.3 million yuan, and various goods, exchange taxes, electric mortgages, and other items had settlements of around 9 million yuan. In addition, Chinese merchants had final settlements worth more than 2 million yuan, foreign merchants had 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan, 600,000 yuan entered the warehouse, and 500,000 yuan left the warehouse. Japanese banks had settlements of 2.5 to 2.6 million yuan for various items, 600,000 yuan left the warehouse. Money shops and silver firms had settlements worth more than 36 million yuan, settlements for overdrafts were more than 4.4 million yuan, settlements for remittances from various sources were more than 1.3 million yuan, and cash receipts were several hundred thousand yuan. Yesterday's market settlements were the first prosperous ones this year.</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Currency Inflows and Outflows: Remittance and transfer tickets amounted to 1.35 million yuan in the morning market and 480,000 yuan in the afternoon market. Banknotes amounted to 64,000 in the morning and 10,000 in the afternoon. Off-exchange banknotes amounted to 123,000 in the morning and 83,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions amounted to 750,000 in the morning and 500,000 in the afternoon. Transactions between foreign accounts in various banks amounted to more than 1.5 million yuan, banknote inflows and outflows amounted to more than 2 million yuan, money shops' foreign public settlements amounted to more than 4.22 million yuan, settlements for foreign overdrafts were more than 1.8 million yuan, foreign currency loans amounted to more than 900,000 yuan, and transactions in small money shops amounted to more than 400,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Money Shops' Call Loans Now Uniformly One Day</h3>
<p>After the money shops finalize their interbank call loan transactions in the market every day, morning and afternoon, they generally have a term of two days, called "two conveniences." This year, at the annual meeting held in the Inner Garden on the eleventh of this month, it was resolved that all call loan transactions made by the same trade, and all transactions made in small associations, would be unified. All finalized call loans would have a term of only one day (for example, money borrowed one day would previously have to be returned on the third day, but now must be returned on the second day). Although it may seem slightly busier in terms of procedures, it is ultimately much more peaceful for the overall situation, so it has already been implemented.</p>
<h3>Stroke-like Gold Premium Surge</h3>
<p>▲ A New High Price of 507 Taels</p>
<p>▲ An Increase of 5 Taels and 4 Qian Compared to Yesterday's Close</p>
<p>▲ Unprecedented Prices Appear as It Steadily Climbs: The surge in the gold premium yesterday, the 28th, became more and more intense, and unprecedented prices appeared. Buying and selling among the trade was very brisk, but supply and demand differed. Both official and unofficial exchange rates were high. There were more speculators and gold dealers involved. In the market, Shengda, Yu Da, Yuancheng Yong, Yuantai, Yichang, and others were mainly selling, while Yuanmao Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Wanxing, Shunli, and others were buying. The price difference before the market was about four taels. Since the big bar silver rate declined repeatedly in the morning market, the market opened high. However, there were ups and downs afterward. At noon, due to a surge in buyers and especially tight exchange rates, it jumped sharply by more than four taels. Later, it was said that overseas exchange markets were firm, and Wanxing, Shunli, Hengxing, and others were all competing to buy, while Yuanmao Yong, Shengda, Taixing, and others had already sold. Exchange rates improved further, and the price quickly jumped to a new high of 507 taels. Foreign exchange rates also showed a decline, and there was a fluctuation of two or three taels afterward. As a result, all exchange rates closed high outside of 506 taels. The forward rate for British gold was calculated to be 1 shilling 11 pence 0.625, and the spot rate was 11 pence. The market sentiment was extraordinarily sharp. Yesterday, London silver bars also declined by 1/16, and American silver declined by 1/4. Exchange rates suddenly rose by 1/16.</p>
<p>▲ Opening Only Increased by 7 Qian in the Morning: The April gold premium initially opened at 501 taels 8 qian, an increase of 7 qian. However, since there seemed to be more sellers, it immediately returned to 500 taels 0 qian 7 qian. But exchange rates were still tight, so it rose again by more than one tael. When the shilling was announced, it was around 502 taels, and the posted rate did not move. Only the Japanese gold rate increased by 125, so it increased from 1 tael 7 qian to 3 taels 2 qian, and the internal market was stable. Banks were trading July British gold at 11 pence 3125, and industry and commerce were offering forward Japanese gold at 1 tael 04 fen 625. Later, Sumitomo offered British gold at 11 pence 25, so around 10:30, it was lowered to 1 tael 4 or 5 qian. Afterward, Hua Bi absorbed April at 11 pence 1875, Zhengjin bought June at 11 pence 25, and Heng Wan, Yuanxing Yong, and others in the market also bought. Moreover, the Guangdong gang were speculating on Japanese gold, so the gold price jumped dramatically, rising by 4 taels. After 11 o'clock, it reached 505 taels 2 qian, and then fell back by 1 tael, staying around 4 taels. Although sellers poured in at noon, the demand did not diminish, so the closing price was 505 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Banks Absorbed Cash, Closing at 06 Taels and a Half: The market opened at 506 taels, which was the continuation of the afternoon's momentum. Then, because buyers were active and exchange rates were also firm, the forward rate for Japanese gold rose to 1 tael 05 fen 5. Chinese banks sold June British gold at 11 pence 0625, and Marcaglia offered US dollars at 46 yuan 75, and the price actually rose to 507 taels. Afterward, the selling side moved slightly, and because the posted rate for British gold only declined by 125, US dollars declined by 25, and Japanese gold increased by 0.5 fen, the market sentiment turned downward. It fell by more than two taels to 504 taels 1 qian at 2:45. Later, it turned upward again. It was heard that banks had a very strong appetite for cash, which boosted market sentiment, so at 3:30, it was 6 taels 12 qian. Then, because retail investors were divesting, it decreased to 5 taels 34 qian at 4 o'clock. Finally, outside firms came to buy, and because the exchange market was still tight, the price immediately increased by 1 tael. The closing price at 4:30 was 506 taels and a half, an increase of 5 taels and 4 qian compared to the day before.</p>
<p>▲ February Settled at 510 Taels 06 Qian: The highest price of the day was 507 taels, and the lowest price was 500 taels 00 qian 7 qian, a difference of 6 taels 3 qian. The revealed price had been changed to 510 taels 06 qian. Because the Japanese gold rate had increased greatly by 125, there was an initial decline of 9 taels, and at noon, it was more than 5 taels. The registered prices were from 504 to 505 taels. February had already reached its expiration date, so it settled at 510 taels 06 qian. The make-up was 504 taels, and the afternoon make-up was 506 taels. The revealed price had been changed to 513 taels. Because the Japanese rate had greatly changed by 0.5 fen, it was calculated to be 6 to 7 taels. The initial opening price for goods was 1 tael 4 qian, the noon close was 4 taels 6 qian, the afternoon was 5 taels and a half, and the closing price was 7 taels. Gold jewelry in jewelry stores had increased to 72 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Dalian Gang Made Up More Than 5,000 Bars: The transactions of various firms showed that Fuchang, Yuanxing Yong, and Taixing sold and then bought back, while Shengda, Yichang, Yu Da, and Yuantai all sold. Dadecheng, Yuanmao Yong, Wanxing, and Shunli all bought. The inflows and outflows of the other firms were irregular. The Dalian gang made up more than 2,000 bars, and also sold more than 1,000 bars. In the afternoon interbank transactions, Wanxing, Shunli, Yu Da, Hengxing, Dadecheng, Bingxing, and Yuantai all bought, while Yuanmao Yong, Shengda, Yichang, and Taixing sold. The Dalian gang continued to buy in 2,000 bars, and also sold more than 1,000 bars.</p>
<p>▲ Gold Exchange to Suspend One Hour of Trading on Sundays: The matter of the Gold Exchange suspending business on Sundays has now been resolved. It is approved that starting from March 2nd, trading will be temporarily suspended for one hour. If Sunday falls on a settlement date, it will be held one day in advance. All brokers were notified yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Adding a Special Margin of 5 Taels Per Bar: Also, because the gold price has been fluctuating too much recently, the board of directors has resolved that a special margin of 5 taels will be added per bar, for a total of 15 taels including the original 10 taels. This was also announced yesterday.</p>

<h3>Government Bonds Revert to Weakness</h3>
<p>▲ Market Conditions Slightly Quiet, Transactions Totaling More Than 3.7 Million Yuan: Yesterday, spot trading in government bonds only totaled 14,000 yuan. Apart from the Sixth Consolidated, Continued Three-Five, and Rehabilitation bonds, none of the others were traded. The futures market was also quiet.

Customs duties were the most active, estimated at 1.26 million yuan. Rehabilitation and Continued bonds averaged only 800,000 yuan. The Sixth Consolidated and Continued Second bonds each totaled about 400,000 yuan. The Seventh Year 96 bond was very quiet, and financial bonds were not traded. As for the changes in the various bonds, because the market sentiment was weak, the selling pressure was quite dominant. The afternoon buying sentiment was very cold, and market prices continued to weaken. However, the trend remained peaceful throughout, indicating that there was still little significant difference between supply and demand. As a result, compared to previous sessions, futures contracts for Customs Duties, Continued Bonds, and Rehabilitation Bonds all fell by half a yuan. Others also generally fell slightly.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: The Price of Yarn is Still Being Suppressed by Sellers</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then weakened, mainly due to numerous rumors regarding the current situation and a thick layer of inventory. This led to a predominantly bearish sentiment, with sellers eager to capitalize on any price increase. Consequently, the market struggled to stabilize and is currently under intense pressure from sellers. However, most prudent individuals are hesitant to short sell beyond 51 taels, considering the overall trend. Barring significantly adverse circumstances, the market may likely experience a period of fluctuation.</p>
<p>▲ Man Brand Slightly Recovers Before Softening: Man Brand started strong, benefiting from two consecutive days of gains in American cotton and improved spot sales. This initially led to a bullish opening.</p>
<p>Prices for each month rose by five to six qian. During the second and third sessions, rumors suddenly emerged, triggering a surge in selling. Prices for each month fell by more than one tael. Consequently, prices for each month dropped by five, six, or eight qian. In the afternoon, some profit-takers covered their shorts, briefly strengthening market sentiment. Prices for each month rose by five or six qian before falling back down by two qian at the close. The total daily trading volume was 17,200 bales. The closing prices for Man Brand are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Man Brand Closing Price, Change, and Open Interest: May 15.16…28, 8003 bales; June 15.14, down 3, 20100 bales; April 15.19, 6, 44,800 bales; July 15.14, 3, 1,800 bales.</p>
<p>▲ Spot Sales Slightly Active and Slightly Firm: Spot yarn sales were relatively active. According to the daily statistics, various merchants bought 1,200 bales, with fellow traders purchasing 1,200 bales. The market was slightly firm. Among the buying merchants, the Guangdong group was the most significant, accounting for 480 bales. In addition, Luzhou bought 165 bales, Shantou 45 bales, Yantai 50 bales, Xiamen 15 bales, the inland region 70 bales, Xuzhou 25 bales, Hankou 25 bales, Anqing 70 bales, Jiangxi 35 bales, Sichuan 105 bales, and miscellaneous groups 50 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>The cotton market has turned firm, with a sharp rise in prices. This is due to rising international cotton prices, a sharp decline in foreign exchange rates, a lack of domestic cotton sources, tight control over sales by the Hankou merchants, and large-scale purchases in the standard market. The future of the cotton market is difficult to predict. ▲ Hankou Brand Rises Sharply by More Than Half a Tael: Cotton futures started strong, benefiting from two consecutive days of gains in American cotton and short covering by retail investors. Hankou merchants maintained tight control, further strengthening the market. Prices for each month rose by three or four qian. In the afternoon, market sentiment remained firm, with prices for each month rising another one or two qian. The total daily trading volume was 36,600 dan. The closing prices for Hankou Brand are listed on the left. Hankou Brand Closing Price, Change, Open Interest:</p>
<p>March 34.85, up .55, 62,900 bales; June 3.30, up .50, 61,600 bales; April 34.45, .55, 72,800 bales; July 34.35, .50, 46,300 bales; May 34.25, .50, 76,700 bales.</p>
<p>▲ Spot Cotton Mills Quiet: Spot cotton business remains sluggish. Mills have turned cautious due to the sharp rise in market prices, with virtually no transactions taking place. 250 bales of Yao cotton arrived at the docks and 100 bales of Shaanxi cotton were sold for 35 taels. Fellow traders purchased through spot cargo warehouses.</p>
<h3>International Cotton Prices Rise More Than Fall</h3>
<p>▲ American Cotton Initially Weak, Then Continues to Rise: Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to selling pressure but then firmed due to buying from New Orleans and short covering. Futures rose by 14 to 21 points, and spot prices rose by 20 points. British cotton futures rose by 1 to 6 points, and spot prices fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. The Indian cotton market was firm and stable, with Pingguole for near and distant futures rising by one rupee, Aomula rising by one rupee, distant futures rising by one to two rupees, Bailuoxi rising by two rupees, and distant futures rising by three rupees. The original telegram records are listed on the left (dated the 27th).</p>

<h3>Grain: The Downriver Rice Market is Stagnant</h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday was the end of the month, resulting in few transactions due to account settlements. Approximately 30 boats arrived. High-quality Changbang white japonica rice remained scarce, and most merchants in the street were taking a wait-and-see approach regarding mid- to low-grade japonica rice. As a result, despite tight supply reports, the market turned weak. This was because sales had declined after the price increases in the previous two sessions, leading to a poor outlook and quiet trading. There were a few buyers for thin rice, but as supply continued to be strong, prices remained stable. With scarce supplies of Yangdu indica rice and rising prices of foreign rice due to the surge in the gold market, indica rice sellers were largely unwilling to sell unless prices increased. Fortunately, buying interest was not high, and the overall market only showed limited firmness. White yuan rice was difficult to increase in Shanghai, but the prices in Jin Tan, Liyang, and northern Jiangsu have recently risen sharply. It is rumored that there were special merchant groups aggressively buying, leading to a rapid price increase. As a result, the Shanghai market turned from weak to firm.</p>
<p>▲ South Shanghai: Many boats arrived from downriver, resulting in thick inventories. Sales of Changshu and Wuxi high-quality machine-milled japonica rice in the street were not inactive. Sellers of Suzhou and Tongxiang machine-milled japonica rice were eager to sell and were unwilling to raise prices. Buyers were still selective and only buying high-quality rice, resulting in the japonica rice market being firm for high-quality rice and weak for lower-quality rice. Sales of thin and early rice from Nanlu, Sijing, Qingpu, and other places were slow, and there were very few buyers, with only sporadic transactions. Price differentials were very large. Arrivals of Yangdu indica rice were extremely scarce. Merchants buying were willing to pay higher prices, but stores were selective in their purchases, resulting in a flat market. During the day, there were inevitably some differences in prices. Transactions in Tongbian, Yinyuan, and Diaofan rice turned weak, and the market was stagnant. Prices were barely maintained at the original levels. Overall, the day seemed quiet, with few illegal markups.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Futures and Spot Prices Both Rise</h3>
<p>▲ Spot Rice Rises Nearly One Jiao ▲ Futures Rice Rises Five to Six Fen</p>
<p>Although foreign rice arrived yesterday, it was mainly to fulfill previously agreed-upon contracts, with very little circulating in the market. Demand from the interior villages and merchants in the street was particularly strong, and the market showed signs of improvement, rising by five to six fen, or even one jiao. 1,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 were offered at 14 yuan and 7.5 jiao, 1,000 bags of No. 2 at 13 yuan and 8.2 jiao, and 7,000 bags of Xiaojiao at 13 yuan and 3 jiao to 3.6 jiao. Foreign rice futures rose due to the increase in spot prices, which boosted sentiment. Furthermore, due to foreign firms refusing to sell, the market became even more bullish. The total market saw the recalling of a little over one thousand tons of futures, with prices rising by five to six fen on average.</p>
<h3>Newly Arrived Jiangxi Machine-Milled Late Rice Sold</h3>
<p>Due to famine and transport restrictions in Jiangxi, no rice had arrived for a long time. In addition to Jiangxi machine-milled Yuan rice, other rice from Jiangxi had not been seen in the market for some time. A new batch of rice, mainly machine-milled late rice, had just arrived the day before yesterday. The quantity was not large. The price was about 15 yuan when it arrived the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the market saw formal trading, with prices at 14 yuan and 8 jiao for a total of only 100 bags.</p>
<h3>Flour Delivery Situation for February</h3>
<p>▲ Warehouse Receipts for 2,000 Bags Delivered</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for February, but the delivery volume was still very low. It is said that brokers had privately cancelled 20,000 bags from Fufeng and Fuxin factories, so the official exchange delivery was only about 2,000 bags of recalled red and blue car flour. The rest was either taken back by the factories or withdrawn by merchants, making the market very quiet. However, the price of foreign wheat rebounded by about one yuan yesterday, so the standard market this month may face a severe situation again. The futures transactions for each month in February are listed below (in thousands of bags):</p>
<p>February 626 April 1,429 June 361</p>
<p>March 1,30 May 378 July 274</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Eastern Goods Driven Higher by the Gold Market</h3>
<p>The piece goods market has softened recently due to the unrest in the current situation. The currently sought-after fine cloth has gradually seen increased inventories. Yesterday, the opening prices all dropped by 2.5 fen. Trumpet Boy opened at 6 taels, 7 qian, and 2.5 fen, and Blue Double Fish and Rainbow Ball both opened at 6 taels and 7 qian. Hankou merchants bought 150 pieces, but demand in the street was weak. Yanghe fine twill was scarce, but merchants from Guangdong and Shantou were actively seeking it. Yihua bleached cloth saw active purchasing in the street as the sales season approached. Jinshanta opened at 7 taels and 7.5 qian, and Yunwai Piaoxiang opened at 7 taels and 9.5 qian. Coarse cloth and coarse twill were consistently falling. The trend of Eastern and Western piece goods was chaotic. Eastern goods were slightly firm due to the rising gold market and the urgent need for cash at the end of the month, which led to more goods being sold. Fine cloth rose by about 5 fen yesterday, with Signal Corps opening at 8 taels and 6 qian, Yueyan at 8 taels and 5.5 qian, and Shile Bird at 7 taels and 5.5 qian. Flower cloth and satin remained weak.</p>
<p>Gongni and crepe de Chine saw very little activity. The timing was not right for Mingxingni, and it was not as popular as before. Sales to Sichuan and Hankou merchants showed some signs of activity. Yongbang merchants were actively seeking bleached cloth. Guo Ziyi opened at 9 taels and 2.5 qian, and Double President opened at 9 taels and 2 qian. Sales of Western goods, such as patterned foreign yarn, corduroy, and poplin, were gradually becoming more active, but prices were difficult to increase.</p>
<h3>Metals: 20 Tons of Pure Antimony Shipped to the United States</h3>
<p>Hunan pure antimony is a special product of China, so countries such as Europe, America, and Japan all depend on China for it. In recent years, foreign firms have been inactive, so the local market has been quiet for a long time, and the selling price has been difficult to increase. The opening price was 250 taels per ton. Yesterday, an American firm purchased 20 tons of spot goods at a price 2.5 taels lower than the general market, at 247 taels and 5 qian. They will be shipped to the United States next Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Horse Brand Cement Prices Increased by 1.5 Qian</h3>
<p>Horse Brand Water-Gate-Clay is produced by the Qixin Company. Due to high costs, the company has agreed to increase the price by 1.5 qian starting yesterday, bringing the price to 3 taels and 5.5 qian per barrel. It is said that people in the same industry did not know this beforehand, so they sold a lot of futures, resulting in considerable losses for many people.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Wufu Ice Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wufu white ice sugar has been delayed this spring due to a later start and cloudy weather, resulting in very little supply. The first batch of goods was reportedly transported by the Taikoo Company's Niuzhuang ship yesterday, totaling over a hundred boxes. There were also only over 40 boxes of high-grade sugar. With scarce supplies, demand continues to exceed supply, so there is hope that prices will rise by about two or three qian.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai White Factory Silk Prices Plunge by Over 100 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign silk market remained flat and weak. The Shanghai White Factory silk market had seen rapid progress since the new year, but recent declines in foreign exchange rates have caused the price of factory silk to plummet. Yesterday, Taihe purchased ten bales of medium-grade B silk, with prices falling by over 100 taels. Sixteen bales of Samsung and other yellow and white coarse silk were also weak.</p>

<h3>Theater News</h3>

Among German films that aim for romance and eroticism, this film is considered the best. When it was publicly screened in a certain cinema last time, the authorities banned children from watching it, which shows that the film's depiction of love between men and women has surprising advantages, which cannot be fully expressed by just kissing and hugging.</p>
<p>▲ Star Film Company's New Film "The Golden Road" Scheduled to Premiere: Star Film Company announces that its new film "The Golden Road," directed by Cheng Bugao, a romantic and cautionary erotic film, has been completely completed in recent days and is currently being actively edited and modified.

<h3>The Ideal Future City</h3>
<p>— Liang Xiongwan</p>
<p>What will the future city be like? This question is indeed difficult to answer. Recently, the French engineer Le Corbusier wrote a book called "The Ideal Future City." It is a very valuable book and worthy of our attention. The book contains detailed considerations and plans for the construction of houses, the accommodation of citizens, and health issues.</p>
<p>The future city, according to Le Corbusier, only needs to accommodate 3 million citizens. The center of the city is the commercial area, where many tall skyscrapers are built. This type of architecture is very novel and particularly strange and wondrous. Whether it is a seaplane, a land plane, or a very large airship, they can all land casually on the roof of the building without any obstacles or inconvenience. In the center of the commercial area, there is also a grand air terminal where dozens of planes and airships can be parked. The terminal is above the road, with elevators connecting them. Under the road are the train tracks. The current cities are just not good enough. Look, almost 60% of the area is completely occupied by houses. The air is neither fresh nor clean, and there are very few trees. Each park is very far apart. Perhaps there are some that are not far away, but in short, with so many citizens enjoying so few trees, it is not reasonable from a hygiene point of view. Therefore, engineer Gao feels the need for trees in the city and suggests that his ideal skyscraper should only occupy 5% of the city's area, while the remaining 95% should be used to plant trees and flowers and build ponds. Yes, even though we live in the city, we need fresh, clean air, just like miners deep underground need to cleanse our minds and invigorate our tired spirits.</p>
<p>The skyscraper he suggested is cross-shaped. In this way, it can save space on the one hand and make the building stronger on the other hand. The roof is flat and can be used for airplanes and airships to park. The front of the roof is in the form of a sawtooth (American woman Ruth, who performed the "Red Dance of Iron Heels" at the Paris Opera House), like vertical stone steps. In this way, there is no reason why the light inside the house is not sufficient. Each side of the cross-shaped skyscraper is planned to be 460 feet long and 700 feet high, and can accommodate 30,000 people. The bottom floor of the building is a garage and an elevator room. Furthermore, the corners of the road are rounded. When cars turn, even if they are driving very fast, there is no danger.</p>
<h3>New York Fire Department Will Use Airplanes to Fight Fires</h3>
<p>A fire expert from the New York Fire Department in the United States recently announced that the department will use airplanes to enhance its firefighting capabilities. The most obvious advantage is that the aircraft's thruster is not in the front but at the top, so when taking off and landing, it can move up and down without the need for a large area, which is very convenient. The aircraft is equipped with belts, pumps, and other useful items such as axes, ladders, and chemical fire extinguishers. In addition, it can accommodate six or seven firefighters or be equipped with seaplane floats, which can also be docked on the water. The world's culture is progressing, and bustling</p>
<p>cities are gradually increasing. High buildings with dozens of floors and crowded streets are making fire trucks no longer applicable to modern prevention. For example, in Chicago and New York, when a fire alarm occurs, it takes a long time and is dangerous for fire trucks to travel through the bustling streets to the scene. It is even more difficult to fight fires in high-rise buildings with dozens of floors. If there are airplanes, time and money can be saved. Once the destination is reached, it can simply be parked on the roof of a nearby building to fight the fire. If the water supply on the roof cannot be reached by air pressure, the pump in the aircraft can be used. The value of an airplane is not very high, but the lives and property of citizens are much safer. (Liang Ying)</p>

<h3>Eunuch Sanbao in the Southern Seas YS</h3>
<p>((6) Mudskipper and Sole Fish)</p>
<p>It was midnight, the silvery moon reflected serenely in the vast Pacific Ocean, and the evening breeze gently caressed the embracing waves. The Pacific Ocean at this moment was exceptionally lovely. A large and clumsy "Big-eyed Chicken" (ship name), led sixty-one ships of the same size, sailing through the vast ocean towards the misty island countries of the south. These sixty-two ships carried a total of 27,800 Han Chinese soldiers and civilians, led by the Ming Dynasty eunuch Zheng He, and his deputy Wang Jinghong. They were said to be going to the southern island countries to promote the prestige of the Great Ming.</p>
<p>Once, during such a moonlit night, the food on these sixty-two ships was almost exhausted, and the southern island countries were still as distant as the boundless sea. So they began to worry. Before long, they had to endure hunger and thirst to keep going. However, the ships, moving as slowly as ants, gradually became even slower. Eventually, they anchored in the vast ocean, waiting for rescue.</p>
<p>At this time, what could Eunuch Sanbao do about his men, who were without food? They had stopped moving because they couldn't bear the urge of hunger. They were not deliberately making things difficult for Eunuch Sanbao. The clever Eunuch Sanbao naturally understood their plight and could forgive them.</p>
<p>Late that night, almost all the hungry people on the sixty-two ships were asleep. Only Eunuch Sanbao and three or four soldiers and civilians were still awake. Eunuch Sanbao instructed those three or four soldiers and civilians to prepare some offerings for him to pray to the Heavenly Emperor.</p>
<p>"Heavenly Emperor, if it is to bestow blessings upon the Great Ming, then may you not let these twenty thousand soldiers and civilians of the Great Ming starve to death. In this vast ocean, what food can we obtain? Besides seafood, but how can we catch these seafoods? Because this is the ocean! If the Heavenly Emperor bestows blessings, then we will not starve to death. Seafood, we hope to be able to obtain it as food. In desperation, in the ocean, I pray that the merciful Heavenly Emperor will grant us some!" After Eunuch Sanbao finished praying, he unconsciously fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning, Eunuch Sanbao got up alone first. He saw many fish leaping from the sea onto the deck, some still jumping on the deck. By the time he woke everyone up, the deck was full of jumping fish, and they were saved from starvation.</p>
<p>"Why are these fish jumping onto the ship?" one soldier said, feeling strange.</p>
<p>"What kind of fish are these?" another soldier asked, picking up a fish from the ground and presenting it to Eunuch Sanbao.</p>
<p>"I don't know, what kind of fish are these?" Eunuch Sanbao said, grabbing the fish.</p>
<p>"These unknown fish jumped onto the ship. I think we should call them mudskippers. If we encounter this kind of fish again in the future, let's call them that," Eunuch Sanbao continued. He then released the fish back onto the ground. Unexpectedly, five fingerprints of Eunuch Sanbao were imprinted on the fish's body. The fish leaped and jumped, but still jumped back into the sea. Later, they never encountered this kind of fish again, even when they arrived in the Southern Seas.</p>
<p>However, the fish with the five fingerprints of Eunuch Sanbao were later called five-finger fish (or mudskippers). To this day, the Han Chinese do not buy them to eat, while the Malays love to eat this fish, because they say that Eunuch Sanbao will protect them.</p>
<p>As for the sole fish, it was a game played by Eunuch Sanbao that became a reality. One day, he encountered rain in the Southern Seas. He was wearing a pair of large shoes, and mud was all over his feet. He stepped into the holy land where the Muslims were kneeling and worshiping, and the holy land was soiled. Someone said to him, "Eunuch Sanbao, look at your footprints!" Eunuch Sanbao turned around, saw his footprints, and felt very embarrassed that he had soiled the place. However, for the sake of his face, he cleverly said, "Haha, my footprints look exactly like a fish!" After he said that, he left.</p>
<p>The next day, those muddy footprints had turned into fish. Those fish at that time are the sole fish that overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia talk about today.</p>
