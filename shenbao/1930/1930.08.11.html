<p>時評</p>
<h3>各國漸趨重農</h3>
<p>美國近注意於救濟農民之方針减輕農産物稅率以挽回農民之反感英當局亦宣布整理農業方法設立大規模之訓練農塲以謀農業之發展今日本農省亦注重獎勵農品輸出以挽救農業界之不振使不景氣得漸减輕觀此數者是今日工業化之各大國皆有漸趨於重農之現象矣</p>
<p>本來重農之各國自歐戰後突向工業方面進展競以銷行商品獲重大利益以刷新其國運而置農業之整理爲緩圖獎勵則先工業而後農業救濟亦先工人而後農人農業方面之倡導維護者少於是乃日見期退步又時加以大水久旱之災農業遂愈陷於不振故今日重工之國其農業無一不現蕭條之象其農民之弱小者無一不愁苦怨懟而亟待援助者也在其時之當局方以全力向工業猛進對於農業則祇求足敷國内之供給即有不足亦寗以巳國所出之商品易鄰邦之農産真能注意於整理農業者實少今則非其時矣工之所出旣無銷納之途失業之人又無安插之地欲求工商業之復興茫然未知何日則惟有轉其目光於農業使工之所餘者以發展於農亦自然之趨勢也</p>
<p>惟我中國工業旣無進步而農業之不振亦復如是使各國整理農業而後皆如日本之鼓勵輸出競以農産物壓迫於中國之巿塲則中國之農又將受若何影響耶國人應早有所覺悟矣</p>

<p>限制樹膠生産</p>
<p>膠價慘跌中之悲痛呼聲</p>
<p>英荷能否合作尚屬疑問</p>
<p>南洋通訊自樹膠生産與銷費失却平匀樹膠存量日見增多價格亦日趨跌落經營該業者旣不免惶恐顧慮而社會人士亦爲駭懼不安爰爲詳述於次以告留心世界經濟現狀者並促國人注意南洋僑胞在膠價慘跌中之苦鬥而知予以援助</p>
<h3>膠價慘跌現狀</h3>
<p>樹膠價格旣趨狂跌樹膠成本究爲何若據著名膠商所述每磅樹膠其平常之生産經費約在叻幣一角九占生左右至土人膠園生産費較低者每磅亦須一角六占但此爲極少數樹膠之成本若此樹膠價格又何如乎當六月中旬每磅售價二角華人小本膠園尚勉力維持以逐微末之利而由膠園停割之失業工人滿街塞巷至七月中旬之膠價突然跌至一角七占成本若彼貨價若此悲號痛哭之呼聲烏得不遍佈南島哉</p>
<h3>限制産膠計畫</h3>
<p>限制樹膠生産之呼聲因五月停割毫無獲益轉而益倡益高今且進而討論永久限制之政策矣七月十九日亞洲人種植會在吉隆坡開會員特别大會檳榔嶼·新嘉坡·柔佛·吉礁·各地均有代表列席此會結果認清限制産膠必經政府立定法例方爲有效五月停割失敗可爲殷鑒且必須與荷屬錫蘭各地合作因前年施行「士蒂芬遜政策」（一九二二年施行一九二八年撤銷乃限制出口而不限制生産辦法）不能獲益故必有大規範之永遠限制方法當經議决（甲）請政府頒行限制律（一）請求政府通過法例限制樹膠出産規定某某時期爲停割時期或再行引用舊時之限制計劃（即士蒂芬遜計畫）而略加鬆弛之但此種法例須待荷屬東印度及錫蘭兩政府頒行同樣效力之法例後方可實行（二）請求政府與荷屬東印度錫蘭及其他有樹膠出産之英屬政府一齊進行在若干年間不許發給土地爲種植樹膠之用（乙）停割日期每月停割十日使减少三分之一生産但應徵求樹膠生産總會之意見然後可使歐亞合作計畫實現</p>
<h3>英政府之態度</h3>
<p>英政府理藩部大臣對挽救樹膠尚無何種計畫至馬來亞政府有借出現金二百五十萬元爲發展樹膠之用惟應如何處置政府决召集著名膠商集會討論亞人種植會巳推陳禎祿爲出席代表如何進行尚屬有待</p>
<h3>坡督將赴荷屬</h3>
<p>亞洲人種植會决議請求當地政府制定限制樹膠出産之法例苟不得荷屬錫蘭等地政府之合作依然不能成爲事實依然無補於事現當地政府對此事正在考慮新嘉坡總督金文泰巳定八月二十七日乘飛機遠游荷屬東印度或與此事有關</p>
<h3>華僑所受痛苦</h3>
<p>華僑在南洋所處地位日見没落小資本膠園大都巳陷欲罷不能欲幹不得之苦前日各樹膠園主擬行减低園工價銀蓋目前膠業慘敗園主遭重大損失苟照目前所行之工資率營業更加虧累故擬請求馬來聯邦政府勞工廳長將工資减低至男子每人每日四角女子每人每日三角但至今尚未實施華人膠園旣無宏大資本復乏國家援助若不停割維持現狀巳捉衿見肘苟欲停割能否渡過難關實爲疑問故南洋經濟苟見潰敗我國華僑首先蒙其慘禍瞻念前途慄慄危懼（七月二十五日小灰）</p>

<h3>林寳華鄭兆佳獲公開雙打錦標</h3>
<p>三對二…戰勝邱飛海江道章</p>
<p>丨連勝最後三盤丨後來居上丨</p>
<p>轟動一時之上海公開雙打網球錦標賽自戰幕揭起羣雄登場相互逐鹿戰至昨日而獲顯身於最後决賽一幕者乃林寳華鄭兆佳對邱飛海江道章林邱江三人因係我國網球界國手即鄭亦以英俊有爲而見許者名將好漢最後相逢不僅雙方名實相符亦覺彼此如願以償也大戰之中邱江不幸於垂成之偉業轉遭慘敗之奇禍而林鄭正慮失敗之將臨怱來意外之成功一悲一喜可想而知比賽結果三對二林鄭勝裁判員沈嗣良</p>
<h3>千載一時難相逢</h3>
<p>雙方技藝超衆英名素著彼此心目之中均有相當之認識同時復互有敬愛之表示惟平素旣難逢比較之機遇遂不易强分其高下自投身參加以來固早知有昨日之會面千載一時在賽者四人不知來年是日能否重見於疆塲機會難逢彼千餘觀衆亦安能再享眼福盡窺天下英雄如昨日之大顯身手也總之昨日之戰在中國網球史上可謂空前盛舉</p>
<p>第一盤…八比一○</p>
<h3>起伏相應</h3>
<p>名將登塲八面威風高壓低抽各有專長林寳華首先發球勁力可畏鄭兆佳相機協助厥功偉大未幾第一局垂手而得輪及江道章發球猛沉無比加以反抽得法遂勝第二局第三局歸林鄭第四局屬邱江總之發球之一組不輪林鄭與邱江莫不得利嗣後起伏相應如一比一·二比二·三比三·四比四·五比五·成爲不易之定例惟林鄭以先發球之關係而占先著也</p>
<h3>中計失敗</h3>
<p>五五之後遽有變動時由鄭發球邱江連施巧計窺敵不備挑球後方鄭因是失敗起伏之勢巳破邱江反以六比五領前誰知邱亦因發球軟弱轉輾失利又成六六比數林寳華發球逞威以直落四勝得一局重行占先江道章如餓虎撲羊勇不可當又成七比七之平局邱飛海抽擊佳妙江道章正反占勢林鄭疲於奔命中計失敗（郎江八比七占前）乃隨後一局邱江處之失當又被林鄭奪去（八八平數）第十七局郎具神化不測之技藝打得對方朿手無策其時值林發球竟乏術挽救第十八局邱江以優越之勢頻向鄭處射擊遂得以十比八第一盤比數如左</p>
<p>第二盤…四比六</p>
<h3>一鼓作氣</h3>
<p>林双以發球占勢鄭之壓球頗具功夫由是二人相得益彰第一局遂攫爲巳有第二局中球外往返飛躍互相在空中射擊目不停視手不停撣誠屬奇觀林鄭較爲迅速乃占上風一鼓作氣連勝二局遥望前途無量樂觀</p>
<h3>再度受挫</h3>
<p>林鄭當勢高氣盛之際突遭對方打擊江之反抽及高壓沉而有勁隨手擊去極有可觀而百忙中憑網欄球又精彩百出加以邱老成自重好整以暇不久二二平數聞於場中然自後彼此又工力適敵難分雌雄者又四局而成四四同數邱江努力加鞭氣燄猝盛林鄭乃再度受挫以四比六失敗比數如左</p>
<p>第三盤…六比二</p>
<h3>先下强手</h3>
<p>邱江連勝二盤聲勢喧嚇不難併吞四荒席捲乾坤而冠軍榮銜亦有捨我其誰之概第三盤旣起邱江又先下强手連賴抽擊高壓之得勢奪來第一第二兩局觀衆信仰邱江勝利之心理因是愈堅</p>
<p>獲得上海公開雙打網球錦標</p>
<p>（右）林寳華（左）鄭兆佳（王開攝）</p>
<h3>逆去順來</h3>
<p>第三局之後邱江軍心懈散手法疏忽以爲天命歸我似不必拒人於千里之外不料林鄭背水力戰志在恢復天酬其志連告成功故後之六局林鄭逆去順來無往不利結果以六比二得勝比數如左</p>
<p>决賽情形（五攝）</p>
<p>第四盤…六比四</p>
<h3>另一景象</h3>
<p>林鄭奪回一盤精神方面得不少之安慰而進攻退守之間亦覺虎然有生色矣最先二局林鄭一再告捷至時邱江振作精神以期早收全功免致功虧一簣故一閃眼又成二二對數此後局面十分緊張初林鄭以三比二占先忽邱江以四比三居前</p>
<h3>千古之恨</h3>
<p>邱江旣得居先之優越地正宜乘勢進完成勛績乃稍一躊躇竟成千古之恨蓋林鄭有聲有色手到功成連下三局即以六比四勝第四盤</p>
<p>第五盤…六比一</p>
<h3>反敗爲勝</h3>
<p>彼此勝負相等錦標誰屬即在此最後一幕而分高下矣林寳華生龍活虎聲色俱厲隨手揮拍都成妙著鄭兆佳謹慎從事活潑可嘉江道章手法混亂邱飛海長力不濟彼此形勢自其來往抽擊之際巳漸分高下林鄭愈戰愈佳而邱江則頽唐不堪最後林鄭以六比一得勝頗覺容易也比數如左</p>
<h3>給獎品大戰閉幕</h3>
<p>大戰告終行給獎禮由委員長胡憲生致詞請胡筠籟君給獎林鄭二君於萬衆歡呼聲中趨前領獎鼓掌四起賀其成功</p>
<h3>論英雄各有千秋</h3>
<p>昨日出場之四傑各有專長林寳華發球最見有勁高居四人之冠其攔網頗多變化其初二盤成績平平最後三盤方見其英雄本色也邱飛海之擅長在乎善於處置不論正反咸能得心應手惟發球無力爲其生平弱點江道章在前之二盤精彩百出可謂其得意之作惜乎其後錯誤累見致遭慘敗功不敵過良用感慨鄭兆佳在昨日表演中巳足證明渠之網球天才之優越而爲將來可造之英雄也其人技藝堪稱上乘而久戰長力亦頗可畏</p>

<h3>書胡子靖</h3>
<p>— 方二</p>
<p>此次長沙爲共軍所佔敎育界人士有黨政關係者類皆脫逃獨湖南大學校長胡子靖未能脫身以遇難聞</p>
<p>胡先生名元倓字子靖湘潭人嘗中鄉試有清末季創辦明德學校於長沙黄克强譚組菴王正廷諸氏皆嘗先後任職該校該校設立近三十年爲湖南私校中最先成立而最有名者尤以胡之善於募欵奔走南北馳名海内</p>
<p>胡之爲人好爲豪語亦有能名年且六十鬚髮皆白湘中敎育界皆尊之爲胡九先生猶長沙紳界之尊俞九先生也俞九先生名誥慶字秩華與葉德輝同以劣紳名被殺於湖南國共未分時今胡又死於非命京中諸友皆謂胡先生年來在湘敎育界極佔勢力旣取大學校長而代之又欲爲省府委員且居恒自誇爲何芸樵主席之老師或因此而中敵者之忌歟未可知也</p>
<p>連日由湘來京請願救難者甚衆皆云胡子靖先生被殺明德學校被焚并殃及隔街之周南女校從此長沙最有名之一男校一女校俱成灰燼可慨也夫旅京多暇爲書其事於此</p>
<h3>華東大學夏令會詳紀</h3>
<p>— 小孟</p>
<p>所謂華東大學者蓋指江南各私立大學南京金陵東吳之江約翰滬江六大學而言歷年有組織夏令會之舉會員除將來之學士外尚有青年會職員及博士碩士家庭博士等等共五十八人</p>
<p>日期　開會日期由七月二十一日起至八月三日止二十一日至二十六日在滬江叙會先是巳約日本勞働家賀川豐彦博士至普陀演講顧賀川君無暇往因即在滬江舉行當時聽者之踴躍實足驚人蓋如賀川豐彦之爲人即覩其丰采亦巳足矣二十六日赴普陀作更深之討論三號回申</p>
<p>旅况　此次旅行可謂實行平民主義男女學生以及敎員博士均居統艙中同舟者咸指而目之曰是爲高等平民之團體晚間或有用帆布床者或有席地而睡者中有一人竟帶鐵床一架高臥於甲板上可謂特别矣翌晨舟中不備早餐於是分羣而共食者滿艙皆是各出其麵包水果罐頭等等以果腹一時約有五隊之多荒島之難民亦不過如是耳</p>
<p>叙會　叙會地點在法雨寺亦稱後寺在佛寺中舉行耶敎徒之叙會可怪矣更可怪者每逢開會時各僧人無不聽之忘倦或謂此乃方丈之博大爲懷也</p>
<p>演講　此次演講領袖中頗多知名之士如敎育局之江鴻起博士工商部駐滬辦事處之壽毅成博士光華大學之羅隆基博士及其夫人英國留學生老前輩潘紹棠先生勞大敎授鄭若谷先生等各領袖均循循善誘學生中無不願加入討論者其中尤以政治領袖羅先生爲最博歡迎學生之加入其討論會者爲最多并有英國式之公開辯論會一次題爲「今日中國應採用民主政治」辯畢有律師某博士謂「諸君須明白今日二字在今日晚十二時之前無論如何不能採用民主政治」聞者轟然大笑蓋此律師乃根本主張今日之中國不能採用民主政治也塲中又有一新自美回國之學生蓋生長美國者此次乃第一次回國不諳國語叙會時受苦不淺遇長時間之演講恒以睡眠爲自適之計云</p>

<h3>窮話</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>文人多窮此昌黎老人所以有送窮文之作也予亦窮措大之一備領窮愁况味因草窮話若干則如左</p>
<p>典質爲窮人所難免個中人遂有「有當有贖上等之人有當無贖中等之人無當無贖下等之人」之語蓋聊以解嘲也</p>
<p>某名人有避債詩一絶云門前索債亂如麻柴米油鹽醬醋茶我也管他娘不得後門走出看梅花」又新年云「東鄰設宴送除夕西舍開筵賀歲朝只有老夫忘肉味一盤豆腐到元宵」是窮中之風趣者</p>
<p>前人詠窮佳什如「太窮常恐人防賊久病都疑犬亦仙」又「可憐最是牽衣女哭說鄰家午飯香」語絶沈痛</p>
<p>諺有「命裏窮終是窮拾着黄金會變銅命裏富終是富拾着紙兒會變布」隱寓人無妄求之意的是勸世良言</p>
<p>「吃在肚裏着在身上」此亦諺語也或有反其說者曰「着在肚裏吃在身上」則窮之歷程尤進一層蓋籍篋服物早巳化爲烏有賸有身上之衣尚待付質易米也</p>
<p>時彦句「門無車馬方爲雅客有琴書不算窮」窮而偏不說窮何等雋妙何等襟懷</p>
<p>曩日報端載有一窮士常糊舊報紙數十百重爲一厚被汚垢輒撕去一重隨撕隨薄則歲序巳由冬而夏矣謂適與氣候衛生相合頗自詡其計之得云</p>
<h3>習舞須知（上）</h3>
<p>— 不舞之鶴</p>
<p>俄人凱爾氏精於跳舞藝術者也記者昨相值於霞飛路Tchachunko花園加非館縱談及此因近日習舞者衆爰記其大概如下氏謂跳舞之爲藝自古流傳可表現個人之情感可顯示人類之意緒故美術家每以舞之姿勢作臨摹之範本昔希臘著名之披法哥羅哲學院且藉舞姿以解釋精神學音樂亦能藉舞踏以表現樂曲之精神於是可見舞藝意義之重大矣心理學家曾云「聽其人之言論即可知其人所受之敎育」於舞亦然觀其舞姿即可知其人之風格也</p>
<p>舞藝可分爲（一）民族舞及土風舞（二）舞臺舞及藝塲舞（三）交際舞三大類交際舞即社交界所用之跳舞夫人類生活上之娱樂爲人生極端重要之事蓋可藉此休養腦力陶冶性情雖爲樂不一要以跳舞爲最美妙者猶學校之有體操運動也舞蹈之功用甚大不特可以造成適宜之體格及優美之姿勢且可以怡悅性情使動作臻於美化精神進於健康故精舞藝者多身體强健長壽而不易老因他種運動咸不若舞蹈之自然適當耳</p>
<p>吾人時以爲舞蹈爲輕而易舉之事致姿勢惡劣動作卑瑣影響於人之品格殊大故於初學時須就敎於專門從事或精諳舞藝者作根本之練習單簡步法熟諳日久自能神而化之然後入交際塲自能得心應手受人歡迎令人欽敬也</p>
<p>申報劉碩甫君對於舞蹈研究頗早承見告關於舞蹈應知之禮儀如下</p>
<p>（一）凡向女賓請求伴舞者首次宜擇與自巳交誼較密者次乃及於全座所尊之女客再次乃及於其他女士因請求伴舞本爲表示敬意先請親密女友以示親愛免致發生他種誤會次及尊客乃爲示敬此外則無關惟須注意如男賓各有其密侣似亦不宜多次請舞更須知男賓少於女賓時不可令一二女賓向隅最末次之舞各女賓多願留伴情人亦宜識趣勿作强求蓋多數女士每藉此末次之舞與其愛人解决下次相約之一切事件也（一）請舞宜俟樂起後一二對伴侣巳經離席然後再默測座中女賓擇其有意欲舞而尚無人請求者先以誠懇而和緩之態度詢其體力覺倦否可否請與同舞經其許可然後起立離座趨至其前代爲移開座椅（舞畢送其歸座亦如之）相隨步入舞場從容起舞態度安詳而大方舉動宜高尚而活潑切忌忸怩作態（一）如必欲請求一定女賓伴舞者不妨預約措辭略如「可否請與我伴舞下次之…狐步或勃羅斯華爾滋」云云</p>

<h3>過去與未來之棉巿</h3>
<p>本年上半年棉巿稍見穩定此以滙率之激變及來源缺乏存底枯薄然實際情形仍屬沉悶蓋印棉價廉而需要者有巨量吸收復以各廠應社會之需要改訪較細紗支而採用品質較優之美棉也兹將過去半年間期棉之變遷與去年同期列表比較如下</p>

<p>就上表觀本年巿價較去年爲高此純爲匯巿所激動蓋支配世界棉巿之美棉再去年爲低印棉亦然外棉雖跌但合價仍高故與外棉成反比例之進退也兹將美印棉巿價比較如下</p>

<p>過去半年間之棉巿巳如上述今後之趨勞固不敢妄測然就記者管見尚少樂觀請略言之美棉以銷費减少滾存增加巿價步跌而至一角三分以下新棉田據政府第一次估計爲四五八一五○○○畝廢田數字尚包含在内如以最近十年間廢田平均率百分之三·六爲比例則實收數將爲四千四百餘萬英畝而以最近十年間平均收量每畝一百五十八磅計則將來收成約一千四百萬包之譜即以一千四百萬包之生産而在目前世界棉業頽敗情形之下推測供求狀况似巳失其平衡若世界棉業長此萎靡而無轉機之象將來滾存有益增之慮則美棉巿之困頓似以不易解除至若印棉以國内革命空氣濃厚棉廠工作時作時輟致存數激增而新棉進行雖辛特有水災之報告然大部份仍屬良好如無激烈之變化欲求巿價之迅速發展似屬不可能之事國内新棉狀况除豫陜等省消息隔閡外其他各省大皆良好如氣候相宜可不失中稔上半年底本埠各廠原棉存底據調查所得約八十三萬四千担兹將半年間供求狀况如下　　半年間消費六月末存底</p>

<p>就上列存數足供下半年二個半月之消費但天氣炎熱各廠工作效率莫不低减更以營業關係而停工或减少工作者時聞則此存數供給當不止二個半月况外棉尚未裝到爲數亦巨觀乎日來巿上現棉交易之清淡與新棉成交之稀少可見一般棉巿之環境如此前途之趨向可略得其梗槪矣惟匯率之變化與紗巿之趨勢要亦有相當之能力也（八·三日農）</p>

<h3>世界文學的故事（一八六）</h3>
<p>— 美國約翰瑪西著胡仲持譯</p>
<p>第四十八章　文亞美利加的論文和歷史</p>
<p>亞美利加的專門的歷史家成就了優秀的工作我是指那些在記錄底歷史上幹着極好的工作的歷史家而言的華盛頓歐文在他那亞美利加及西班牙的歷史的研究優於創造了李迫及匿克巴克爹爹的温和的諧謔家他對於曾經開始研究寫作墨西哥史爲了盲目而受妨礙的青年普勒斯珂特以非常的禮讓拜服過那墨西哥史使普勒斯珂特成名了他進而從事於「秘魯的征服」的研究繼則從事於「腓立普二世」的歷史我從後代的歷史家知道他的作品有許多作爲歷史巳經被廢棄了然而他在那事實以事實能夠獲得爲限却没有弄錯他的書至今還是可讀的丨丨我不是給與歷史家的證言乃是給與文學者的證言的</p>
<p>馬可脫温當製作他所珍重的書籍的論文和歷史</p>
<p>表時說道「帕克曼的一千卷如果他寫了那麽樣多」帕克曼對於亞美利加的西北且對於亞美利加共和國開始以前英吉利人和法蘭西人的鬭爭懷着興味較之「拉薩拉」及「蒙忒卡謨和華爾夫」更其淵博的歷史是有的罷而嚴密地科學底的歷史家也會將帕克曼當作羅曼主義者而加以頗兇的駁擊的罷然而他年處理的主材本質上是羅曼底他的書雖非至最後的叙述爲止始終精確總也至最後的文章爲止始終有蠱惑力的</p>
<p>第四十九章　亞美利加的詩</p>
<p>我聽得亞美利加的所歌　有變化的合唱我聽得</p>
<p>—惠特曼</p>
<p>凡有文學的形式之中凡在大西洋的西北岸所寫的種種形式的標本之中亞美利加的詩具有内容和色彩和作詩所在的那大陸的特異的活力最少除了許多讀者並不看作亞美利加精神的代表者惠特曼之外又除了用地方底或種族底方言所寫的兩三篇詩叙述了特是屬於這國度的風景和主材的數篇詩之外亞美利加的詩大都可以說是由英吉利的小詩人所寫的罷</p>
<p>亞美利加詩所具有的轉假底從屬底第二義底的性質不一定是亞美利加詩人的屈從性的證據却是證明着英吉利詩的壓倒底力的東西之一我們在散文可以亞美利加風地想然而我們却非英吉利風地歌唱不可亞美利加詩人往往没有如法蘭西人德意志人英吉利人感到本國似的感到自巳所住的國或國的一部在這里愛國主義的問題毫不存在繆斯的神除了能從愛國主義製作音樂的時候之外輕蔑愛國主義者而詩人之爲亞美利加人終究是較之詩人之爲詩人更不重要的</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>時代青年創刊號</h3>
<p>— 光美</p>
<p>大光書店代售</p>
<p>提起「青年」二字腦筋裏便立刻會想象到活潑强壯充滿着朝氣一般健兒們青年時代是人生最足寳貴的一個階段青年被一般人的期望異常深切大家都知道青年是國家的元氣同時也是國家和民族生命的寄托一個民族的興盛衰頽視青年界的情况如何以爲斷青年所負的責任是何重大可是青年在學校裏求學時期有許多優秀的學子未嘗不願本着他的志願對於所學希圖登峰造極爲社會爲國家服務但事實上並不如何簡單畢業之後往往不能達其目的我們試單觀察以往以至於現在的中國有專門學識的人尤其是專於農工商業方面的有幾許人是如願以償的被政府所引用像各國政府以財力供給某一個人終身去研究某種科學的那更屬幻夢即有許多人是被政府所引用的又大都所用非所學而這班所學非所用先生們一旦身居要職個人的一切都不生問題了未嘗不有心顧及到爲國家振興一切的初衷和計劃但在政治舞台上方知事實上有許多地方不能依照着理想而進行旣不能遂其初衷不消說也只有起了混合作用久而久之與一班舊人物還有什麽兩樣在這種情形之下青年於是便産出下列兩個感想其一政府太不注重專門人才因之也不願去專心研究其二青年學子也跟着妥恊因此青年的出路便成了一個大問題青年對於出路的失望當然是不得不灰心這樣一來好了頽廢派浪漫派墮落派厭世派腐化惡化各色各樣應有盡有的會層出不窮青年的情態旣如此再加以固有的靜止的保守的民族性於是我數青年便自然地形成了這萎靡的不健全的現象影響於民族前途甚大這種現象在今日是不容我們忽視了</p>
<p>我嘗這樣講從中等以上學校起無論任何學校若將他裏面的幾百或千數學生的個性·思想·行爲一一分析起來真是無所不有推其原因就是因爲没有一致的中心思想不但學生本身如此所讀的書籍也很有關係中國的書籍旣缺乏一貫的中心思想而且又是個事事落後的國家因之有許多智識不得不借助於外國一般醉心舶來品的先生們只要是外來的貨物就是糟粕也當珍錯加之敎師也無所謂一貫的中心意識顧到中華民族的前途他們只是各行其是甚至連危害民族的思想與學說也會介紹過來隨着這種錯誤的觀念便造成目前整個青年界思想棼亂的狀態</p>
<p>我們敢相信青年因了没有一致的中心意識對現實就起了不滿有不滿於現實而又不知改革者有欲改造而無門徑者當然精神上是要感覺痛苦不過不滿於現實並非不良現象否則社會倒没有進化了今後關於青年思想善導問題應該非把那些各種不同思想不同路道的青年行到一道正軌上來建樹一個中心思想不可歷史詔示我們要救濟中華民族的危亡唯有喚起民族意識爲中心但出版物中這一類的著作委實不多自從讀過了中國民族主義文藝運動者六月一日發表的民族主義文藝運動宣言後繼着就有前鋒週報的出版這當然是可欣幸的事最近我又發見一種青年刋物「時代青年」不得不再向我們青年同志鄭重介紹一下</p>
<p>昨晚至西門大光書店買書一進門首先印入眼簾的不是那些富有藝術化的小說封面而是單張報紙式的「時代青年」這是該刋的創刋號要目除發刋辭外有湯增敭的「現代中國青年病態的解剖」鐵僧的「世界弱小民族反帝運的鳥瞰及中國民族求自由平等的出路」霞軒的「寫在時代青年的前面」朱劍白的「今後我們對文藝的認識」徐則驤的「爲民族而邁進」一德的「時代青年」</p>
<p>每篇文章的内容恕我不及一一抄錄劉待讀者自巳去把玩吧我們只須看着李錚君在發刋的一段話便可得知該刋的態度和宗旨了「……目前整個青年界凌亂的狀態我們要如何建樹一個中心的思想這便是本刋首先的要求我們所要求的就是希望全國的青年大家共同努力在這一個風狂雨暴的海洋之中建築一個指示青年航行者的燈塔其次我們覺得青年界力量的渙散總是國家和民族的危機這一張小小的刋物要點在一盤散沙的青年界由共鳴而到共信……又次我們觀察青年界除了凌亂的不良現象以外又見到更不好的一種頽唐氣象……也許對於墮落的青年有忠誠的慰勸此外是關於青年運動理論方面的想在這刋物上有多少的貢獻但這是一個重大的問題我們要希望全國青年對此有熱烈的討論此外如政治經濟的研究社會問題的討論都是青年求知必需的方法也就是另一個使命……」由上述的意義看來可知該刋對於青年界的貢獻了所以我鄭重介紹一下希望我們青年人手一編</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Countries are Gradually Emphasizing Agriculture</h3>
<p>The United States has recently focused on the policy of rescuing farmers, reducing agricultural tax rates to win back farmers' resentment. The British authorities have also announced the reorganization of agricultural methods, establishing large-scale agricultural training farms to seek agricultural development. Today, Japan's Ministry of Agriculture also emphasizes encouraging the export of agricultural products to rescue the agricultural sector's slump and gradually reduce the economic downturn. Observing these examples, major industrialized countries today are gradually moving towards emphasizing agriculture.</p>
<p>Originally, countries that emphasized agriculture suddenly progressed towards industry after the European War, competing to sell goods and gain significant profits to revitalize their national fortunes, while putting the reorganization of agriculture as a secondary goal. Rewards were given to industry before agriculture, and relief was given to workers before farmers. There were few advocates and defenders of agriculture, so it gradually declined. Adding disasters such as major floods and prolonged droughts, agriculture fell deeper into decline. Therefore, today's industrial countries all show signs of decline in their agriculture. None of the small farmers are not worried, resentful, and urgently awaiting assistance. At that time, the authorities were focusing all their efforts on industry, seeking only to provide sufficient domestic supplies for agriculture. Even if there was a shortage, they would rather exchange their own products for agricultural products from neighboring countries. Few were truly concerned with reorganizing agriculture. Now, it is no longer the time for that. Since there is no way to sell industrial products, and there is no place to settle unemployed people, seeking the revival of industry and commerce is unclear when it will happen. Therefore, the only option is to turn their attention to agriculture, so that what remains of industry can develop in agriculture, which is also a natural trend.</p>
<p>However, China's industry has not made progress, and its agriculture is also declining. If all countries reorganize agriculture and then, like Japan, encourage exports and compete to oppress China's market with agricultural products, what impact will Chinese agriculture have? The people of the country should be aware of this early on.</p>

Most of the enemy troops are young adults, clearly lured by traitors here who tell them that various tribes will respond and that there are opportunities to plunder. Otherwise, why would the Afridi tribe risk traveling such a long distance in such hot weather? The North Xia Hua army and air force are still strong enough to resist any fierce attack. In addition to the garrison, the authorities are currently only using four battalions, of which only one battalion and one squadron are purely British troops. No matter what, the enemy troops number no more than 3,000, and the Afridi tribesmen scattered in the villages southeast of North Xia Hua number only a few hundred. The border heat is almost unbearable, but the air force continues to attack and disperse the enemy troops despite the difficulties. Since Wednesday, six teams of airplanes have been constantly dropping bombs, dropping 6,000 bombs in one day.</p>

<p>Restricting Rubber Production</p>
<p>A Tragic Cry Amidst the Plunge in Rubber Prices</p>
<p>It is Still Uncertain Whether Britain and the Netherlands Can Cooperate</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Correspondence: Since the balance between rubber production and sales has been lost, rubber inventories have been increasing day by day, and prices have been declining. Those engaged in the industry cannot help but be alarmed and worried, and members of society are also shocked and disturbed. Therefore, I will elaborate in detail below to inform those who are concerned about the world economic situation and urge the people of the country to pay attention to the hard struggles of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang amidst the plunge in rubber prices and to know how to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation of Plunging Rubber Prices</h3>
<p>Since rubber prices have been declining wildly, what is the cost of rubber production? According to well-known rubber merchants, the normal production cost of rubber per pound is about 19 cents in local currency. The production cost of rubber plantations by local people is lower, at about 16 cents per pound, but this is only for a very small number of rubber costs. What is the price of this rubber? In mid-June, the selling price was 20 cents per pound. Small Chinese rubber plantations could still barely maintain themselves to pursue a small profit, and unemployed workers from rubber plantations that had stopped tapping filled the streets and alleys. By mid-July, the price of rubber suddenly fell to 17 cents. If the cost is so high and the price is so low, how can the cries of grief and pain not be spread throughout the South Seas?</p>
<h3>Plans to Restrict Rubber Production</h3>
<p>The call to restrict rubber production has grown stronger due to the failure of the May shutdown to yield any benefits. Now, the policy of permanent restrictions is being discussed. On July 19th, the Asian Rubber Planters' Association held a special members' meeting in Kuala Lumpur. Representatives from Penang, Singapore, Johor, and Kedah attended. The meeting concluded that restricting rubber production effectively requires government legislation. The failure of the May shutdown serves as a warning. Cooperation with Dutch-owned lands and Ceylon is also essential. The "Stevenson Plan" implemented in previous years (implemented in 1922 and revoked in 1928, which restricted exports but not production) did not succeed. Therefore, a large-scale, permanent restriction method is necessary. The following resolutions were passed: (A) Request the government to enact a restriction law. (1) Request the government to pass legislation restricting rubber production, stipulating a certain period as a shutdown period, or to reintroduce the old restriction plan (i.e., the Stevenson Plan) with slight relaxation. However, such legislation must only be implemented after the governments of Dutch East Indies and Ceylon have enacted similar laws with the same effect. (2) Request the government to collaborate with the Dutch East Indies, Ceylon, and other British-owned governments with rubber production to prohibit issuing land for rubber cultivation for a certain number of years. (B) Shutdown for ten days each month to reduce one-third of production, but the opinion of the Rubber Producers' Association should be sought first so that the European-Asian cooperation plan can be realized.</p>
<h3>The Attitude of the British Government</h3>
<p>The British Colonial Secretary has no plans to save rubber. However, the Malayan government is considering lending 2.5 million yuan to develop rubber. The government will convene a meeting of prominent rubber merchants to discuss how to handle it. The Asian Rubber Planters' Association has nominated Chen Zhenlu as its representative. How things will proceed remains to be seen.</p>
<h3>Singapore Governor to Visit Dutch Territory</h3>
<p>The Asian Rubber Planters' Association resolved to request the local government to formulate laws to restrict rubber production. If the cooperation of the Dutch territories and Ceylon cannot be obtained, it will still not be possible to achieve results and will not help the situation. The local government is currently considering this matter. The Governor of Singapore, Sir Cecil Clementi, is scheduled to travel by plane to the Dutch East Indies on August 27th, possibly in connection with this matter.</p>
<h3>Suffering of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>The status of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia is declining daily. Small-capital rubber plantations are mostly trapped in a dilemma: they cannot stop, but they cannot continue. The other day, the rubber plantation owners planned to reduce the wages of plantation workers, because the rubber industry is currently suffering a disastrous defeat, and the plantation owners are suffering heavy losses. If the current wage rate is maintained, business will suffer even more losses. Therefore, it is planned to request the Chief of the Labor Bureau of the Federated Malay States to reduce wages to four corners per day for men and three corners per day for women, but this has not yet been implemented. Chinese rubber plantations lack large capital and national assistance. Maintaining the status quo without stopping production is already a struggle. If they want to stop production, it is doubtful whether they can overcome the difficulties. Therefore, if the Southeast Asian economy collapses, overseas Chinese will be the first to suffer. Looking ahead, they are filled with fear and trepidation. (July 25, Little Gray)</p>

<p>Japanese Ministry of Agriculture Encourages Exports</p>
<p>Seeking to Restore the Decline of Rural Areas</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Exports are Gradually Becoming Stronger</p>
<p>Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is seeking to restore the decline of rural areas and establish fundamental policies for rural revitalization. It plans to realize these within the scope of the budget permitted from this year onwards. To establish future revitalization policies for rural areas, it has ordered the Agriculture, Sericulture, Forestry, Livestock, and Fisheries Bureaus to separately study response strategies based on this principle. Among them, for specific policies to maintain agricultural product prices and increase farmers' income, the ministry has decided that the following matters should be implemented in the future: (1) To prevent the import of agricultural products, encourage exports, and encourage the production and increase of various agricultural products. The types are as follows: (A) Prevent imports of wheat, rapeseed, ramie, sesame seeds, starch, vegetable oil, and oil cake. (Wheat, rapeseed, and ramie are currently being encouraged to increase production under established plans.) (B) Encourage exports of peas, lily bulbs, mandarin oranges, mint, pyrethrum, rapeseed oil, green tea, etc. (2) Plan for the regulation and consolidation of agricultural product joint production and sales organizations. At the same time, enable agricultural associations and other organizations to investigate and report on the national supply and demand relationship of agricultural products to achieve smoothness, prevent improper price drops, and maintain fair agricultural product prices. (3) To increase farmers' income and prevent price drops due to overproduction of agricultural products, popularize and encourage joint processing facilities for agricultural products. (5) Encourage appropriate side businesses to increase farmers' income. (World)</p>

<p>Japan Supplements National Defense Budget</p>
<p>Striving for Thrift, Requiring Approximately 300 Million Yuan</p>
<h3>Dentsu, Tokyo, 10th</h3>
<p>The Naval Affairs Headquarters is currently urgently preparing a supplementary national defense plan budget based on the proposal of the Naval General Staff. The core of this plan is the expansion of the air force. It plans to designate ten teams out of the current seventeen teams as training teams and establish fifteen new teams, for a total of thirty-three teams. In addition, the plan will also consider (1) building a new 12,000-ton aircraft carrier, (2) building four 8,600-ton cruisers when replacing six-inch gun cruisers, (3) building more small ships when replacing submarines, (4) upgrading capital ships, (5) increasing combat skills training expenses, and (6) establishing new research institutes. Therefore, the required funding is quite large. If the original proposal of the Naval General Staff is adopted, it will require nearly 300 million yuan, so it is planned to strive for savings to around 300 million yuan. Approximately 40 million yuan will be needed next year.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Sino-Russian Conference Still Stalled</h3>
<p>The Russian side insists on expanding the scope of the meeting</p>
<p>Mo Dehui Sent a Secretary Back Home for Instructions</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The preliminary meeting of the Sino-Russian Conference has been stalled for many days since the expansion of the scope caused disagreement between the two sides. In addition to repeatedly telegraphing the central government for instructions, Mo Dehui sent his secretary Wang Huanwen back to Harbin on the 24th of last month, carrying a report to be forwarded to Liaoning, reporting on the progress of formal meetings in the past month and requesting Liaoning to convey the central government's instructions to mediate the stalemate. Wang took the documents of Liaoning's instructions and the official seal of the Sino-Russian Conference Delegation issued by the central government back to Moscow at 3:30 pm yesterday. Diplomatic messenger Fu Zhanwen, who was waiting for the central government's instructions, was transferred to Harbin after receiving Mo Dehui's order and sent to Russia. Mo has been abroad for three months since he left the country on May 1st, and the originally fixed expenses of the central government were 45,000 yuan per month, totaling 135,000 yuan for three months, plus 50,000 yuan for dressing expenses and travel expenses, and 25,000 yuan for temporary entertainment expenses, totaling 210,000 yuan. A batch (200,000 yuan) had been remitted before leaving the country, and now the meeting has not concluded, so it has been extended for another three months, and the 120,000 yuan from the Guan Yin Hao in Liaoning and the three eastern provinces was remitted to the Far East Bank on the 3rd of this month to Moscow. According to Wang Huanwen's report to the country on the meeting issue, the Russian side demanded that the scope be expanded based on the record of the Boli meeting, and that the Chinese government issue a declaration acknowledging the validity of the Boli agreement, and then China and Russia would conduct an expanded formal meeting based on this declaration to resolve everything. Mo Dehui was afraid that the telegram would be brief, and the central government might not fully understand the Soviet Union's requirements, so he specially sent Wang Huanwen to bring the documents back to the country, and asked Liao Fang to forward the matter to the central government. It was heard that the central government's intention was that issuing a declaration at this time would contradict the previous and later diplomatic policies toward Russia, so it was decided to give Mo a brief outline of the scope of negotiations. Fearing that the telegram would leak the news, the forwarding to Liaoning was still sent by the foreign messenger. At present, Mo Dehui and Karakhan have stopped negotiations and are waiting for the central government's instructions to arrive before opening this stagnant situation. It is rumored that the official meeting was held on August 1st. According to Moscow news obtained here, there is no such thing. In addition to the office dormitory in the Austrian business agent office and the former Minte Hotel, the delegation eats three meals a day in the special train where the delegation takes at the Moscow Central Station. The delegation brought several cooks, so there is no difficulty in food and drink. (August 5)</p>
<h3>Central Army Crosses Wenkou and Advances North</h3>
<p>The Right Wing Besieges the East City of Taian</p>
<p>The Left Wing Extends to the Feicheng Line</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: News from the Jinpu Front. After the Central Army defeated the Jin Army at Nanyi, Ningyang, and Gongli, it advanced north separately. The Jin Army has a heavy defense line in Dakou, setting up power grids, mines, trenches, and obstacles in the area 25 miles south of the Wenhe River. The defenders are the Huo and Duan marshals of Li Shengda's troops. At this point, they have felt overwhelmed and have been attacked by Chen Cheng's troops from the right wing and Xia Douyin's troops from the front, and Ma Tengjiao's troops from the left flank. The Jin Army collapsed across the line and fled north. Therefore, the Central Army crossed Wenkou and advanced north in large numbers. The advanced troops have now arrived at Northeast Fort. The troops of Cai Tingkai on the right wing had already advanced into Taian and were besieging the east city of Taian. Ma Tengwen's troops even reached Jieshou from the left side of the road, cutting off the road. The Jin Army in Taian has no way to return. A part of them has collapsed north from the west gate of Taian. At present, the Central Army has merged the troops on the front with a part of the troops on the right wing, pressing on Taian and attacking Jinan. Another part is actively expanding north from the Laiwu area to contact the troops of Han, Liu, and Li on the Jiaoji Line. The troops on the left wing are divided into the Feicheng, Wenshang, Dongping, and Dong'e lines and are developing separately. Now Liu Zhi has gone to the front to command. Qian Zongze previously led a train of materials north to supervise the repair of the tracks and returned to Xuzhou yesterday. According to Qian's words to the reporter, the tracks north and south of Nanyi were severely damaged when the Jin Army retreated. It has been rushed to repair, and there are more bridges in the northern section. It is expected that one bridge can be repaired every day, and military vehicles can reach Nanyi within days. According to military information, the Central Army intercepted a telegram from Fu Zuoyi to Lu Zhonglin on the Jinpu Line, saying that the failure on the Jinpu Line prompted a counterattack on the Longhai Line in order to contain military strength.

<h3>Bandit Disaster in Northern and Western Jiangxi</h3>
<p>The Tragic Situation of Zhu and Mao Attacking Anyi</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, 8th: When Zhu and Mao's communist bandits retreated from Gao'an to Fengxin a few days ago, they kidnapped very few hostages in Fengxin and demanded thousands of yuan from Zhang Xun's housekeeper, otherwise they would burn the house (it is rumored that it has been burned down). Later, on the 5th, they invaded Anyi and captured the county seat on the 6th. Prisoners in the prison were released, and the county office's files were all burned. The houses of Xiong Shihui, commander of the Fifth Division, were also burned, and as many as fifty to sixty hostages were kidnapped. Xiong Jiaju, the county magistrate of the county, was unable to resist and led hundreds of Jingwei troops and thousands of refugees to Ma Lukou, twenty miles away from the Tujiapu station on the Nanxun Road, to defend the place, while asking the 52nd Brigade and the 150th Brigade stationed in Tujiapu and De'an for help. At the same time, Lu and Zhang were telegraphed from Tu for a quick dispatch of troops to relieve the disaster. It is said that Lu and Zhang have ordered Dai and Luo's brigades to advance along the Nanxun Road at any time. Zhu and Mao's move is to peek at the Nanxun Road. According to Xiao Wenduo, the chief of staff of the Provincial Bandit Suppression Headquarters, "The strength of the communist bandits was originally very small, but now it has increased a lot. The recent deployments are divided into three routes. The first route is led by Zhu De, the commander of the pseudo-First Corps, and the pseudo-Third Army, Huang Gonglue, the Fourth Army, Lin Biao, and the Twelfth Army, Wu Zhonghao, are responsible for attacking Nanchang. The second route is Peng Dehuai attacking Changsha. In addition, there is a route attacking Wuxue. This is his first step in the plan. The second step is to riot in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. If we do not take precautions, the impact on public security will be greater in the future. Zhu and Mao attacked Zhangshu and Gao'an a few days ago, why not attack Nanchang? Because the trenches and power grids near Nanchang are very solid and meticulous, and the 18th Division has been completely concentrated, so Zhu and Mao did not dare to send themselves to death, so they changed their plan to attack Nanxun Road. Now they have gone from Fengxin to Anyi. There are Dai Yue, Luo Shouyi, and two brigades above on Nanxun Road, and the fortifications in Jiujiang are also very strong, so it is difficult to succeed. However, Zhu's task is to capture Nanchang, and Peng's capture of Changsha is showing off his power. It is inevitable that he will be eclipsed by comparison, so we predict that Zhu De will never stop here." When Zhu and Mao attacked Nanchang a few days ago, all sectors of the city telegraphed to Chairman Jiang and Director He to send troops to rescue them, and they all received replies from the province. (1) "The Provincial Business Federation and the Nanchang General Chamber of Commerce are informed that the communist bandits are rampant and are ready to act. They are not only pressing the provincial capital, but also peeking at Nanxun. We are preparing to deploy a large army and are asking the commander-in-chief to determine the policy of suppressing the remnants of violence and settling the people, in order to live up to the wishes of the gentlemen. He Yingqin respectfully replies." (2) "Jiangdian knows that a brigade of the Tan Division and a regiment of anti-smuggling troops have been sent to Xun to rescue the victims. We respectfully reply to the General Staff Department by order of the Commander-in-Chief."</p>
<p>The Ji'an area is very important to the western half of Jiangxi. Since Zhu and Mao sneaked into northern Jiangxi, the communist bandit pseudo-20th Army, led by Duan Qifeng, has repeatedly besieged Ji'an. They were all defeated by Deng Ying of the New 13th Division. The Duan bandits are now retreating to the Donggu area. In addition to sending troops to protect farmers' harvests (the communist bandits do not allow farmers to cut rice in order to cut off food in the city) and maintain the Jiaohe waterway, Deng is also preparing to join forces with the Ma Brigade of the 12th Division in Ganzhou to suppress the Donggu bandits. Commander-in-Chief Jiang sent a telegram to Deng praising his efforts in bandit suppression to encourage him. The City Security Promotion Association also raised 10,000 yuan to buy tens of thousands of towels, tens of thousands of bottles of medicinal water, and canned goods, etc., and sent them to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters for distribution to various departments to comfort them.</p>
<h3>Rioters in Wuhan Sniper at Lecturers</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Wuhan military police have shot many communists in recent days to suppress the reaction, to show a clear warning, but they are still active in secret, unafraid of death. Among the crowd watching the killing, there are always young people shouting reactionary slogans, and reactionary slogans are secretly pasted on the walls of streets and alleys. When lecturing on the crimes of the Communist Party in popular education halls and public libraries, a small number of listeners shout slogans and disrupt the order of the audience. However, the party members have many plans and are closely planned. When the military police realize it, they are often escaped, and very few of those arrested are caught. At about 3:00 pm yesterday, Wan Zhengdao (age 25, from Xiaogan County, Hubei Province), a librarian at the Provincial Fourth Popular Library in Liangdaojie, Wuchang, was giving a lecture on stage. There were dozens of listeners sitting in front of the podium. When Wan spoke of the Communist Party's crimes of murder and arson, a person in a silk shirt suddenly pulled out a pistol and shot Wan. Seeing that the situation was bad, Wan quickly stepped down and fled backwards. The rioter chased after him and fired two more shots, hitting Wan's head and left ribs. Wan fell to the ground immediately and died. The murderer escaped in the meantime. The librarian reported the case to the nearby police and transferred it to the Public Security Bureau to strictly investigate the murderer. At the same time, he reported to the court to send someone to examine the body. At about 2:00 am that night, the Sixth Regiment of the Third Training Division stationed in Wuchang and the Public Security Bureau captured many male and female students at Zhang Chuzhong School on the side of the radio station inside the Dadongmen of Wuchang. They were immediately escorted to the Wuchang Public Security Bureau and are now being interrogated strictly, which may be related to this case. (August 9)</p>
<h3>The Fujian Authorities Deal with Chen Guohui's Troops</h3>
<p>Order Fang Shengtao to Transfer Chen's Troops to Quanzhou</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After Chen Guohui's troops captured the Huyang District of Yongchun, they besieged Xiumei Fort and other places under the jurisdiction of the county. The battle was extremely fierce. The local party department and the people had previously telegraphed to all parties, describing Chen's troops trampling on Huyang. Chen also telegraphed to the military commissioner Fang Shengtao afterwards, saying that he was ordered to concentrate his troops to discuss the fact that Luhu Yang was a necessary place, and that the local militias had been misused, causing misunderstandings, etc. Yesterday, Lin Zupei, the magistrate of Yongchun County, and Xu Qingrui, the county commissioner, came to the province to petition, and Magistrate Dai of Xianyou County was afraid that the war would spread to Xianyou. He also submitted a request to the provincial government for instructions on whether to send a team to intercept the troops, and asked the provincial government to send a telegram to Lin Shouguo's brigade of the Marine Corps to send troops to the county to fill in the defense. The provincial government sent a telegram to Fang Shengtao to quickly transfer Chen Guohui back to Quanzhou for proper handling, and separately telegraphed Chen Jiliang to order Lin Shouguo of the Second Marine Brigade and the two counties of Putian to find ways to rescue the victims of Huyang. The following is the telegram Chen Jiliang sent to Lin Shouguo: "I have recently been informed by Lin Zupei, the magistrate of Yongchun County, and Xu Qingrui, the instructor of the county, that Chen Guohui attacked Huyang on July 11th, and the entire lake was lost on the 14th. As of the 18th, more than a thousand people were massacred, eight or nine hundred houses were burned, countless people were looted, and more than 20,000 refugees were displaced in Xiande. The refugees who escaped to De were also kidnapped by Xu Fei's Feilong by hundreds of people. The extreme injustice is the worst that Yongchun has ever seen. Please send a team to severely suppress the bandits and order the Putian County Government to assist in raising relief funds to save the victims. According to this investigation, Chen or Hui attacked Huyang, even if he had old grudges with the local militias, it was wrong to cause a war for no reason. What is the guilt of the people who have suffered this tragedy? I hope that the brigade commander will quickly discuss with Special Commissioner Fang to order Chen Guohui to quickly withdraw his troops from Huyang so that the brigade commander can find a way to escort the victims back to Hu'an to live. At the same time, the counties of Putian, Xian, and Hui will cooperate with various charities to quickly raise funds to care for the refugees and hope to report the handling situation.

<h3>The Han River Flood Almost Caused a Major Disaster</h3>
<p>Many sections of the Shantou River Dike Collapsed</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: There have been hurricanes passing through Chaoshan for several days, followed by heavy rain. The water level of the Han River rose sharply by 16 feet in one day. According to the standard of the embankment, the water level was more than one foot above the ground. The Dongmen Bamboo Wood Gate and the Shuimen of Chao'an City were sealed with waterproof wooden boards to twelve pieces, and the city gates were blocked with mat-wrapped sand and soil to prevent water from flooding into the city. The Beiti of Chao'an is the barrier of the three counties of Chao, Cheng, and Jie. There were also four leaks in the dike, which were extremely dangerous. The Ji'an Chengye and Xingdeng Jiyi Baode Halls in the city urgently sent people to rescue the dike, which was safe. The Dongjiang District of Chao'an is located in the center of the lower reaches of the Han River and the east and west rivers, and is surrounded by high dikes to prevent water. On the afternoon of the 2nd, the Pengdong, Longkou, Jingmei, and Shuitou dikes in the district were washed away by the flood one after another. The Shecuozhou dike was also washed away by dozens of feet of water. The water rushed in from the gaps like thousands of horses, and the fields, houses, livestock, vegetables, and fruits were all swept away by the huge waves. The victims climbed on the roofs or high trees to survive. The wails of the victims were unbearable to hear. The North Ti of the Beiguan District leaked in four holes, and the Ciqian of the Longjin District also collapsed for dozens of feet. They are now trying to rescue the embankment. The Han River splits into two tributaries below Chao'an, one to Shantou and one to Baojiang District. There is an old dike in Yuepu, halfway between Shantou and Yanbu on the Chao-Shan Railway. On the 3rd, it was washed away by more than 500 feet of water. The Longwei Dike was washed away by 50 to 60 feet. The dike protection road along the dike was washed away by 700 to 800 feet. The flood broke the dike and rushed straight to the Chi Zhangjia Cuo and Da Jiaodai, and was covered by a vast expanse of water below the Yanbu Station. Fortunately, the early paddy fields have been harvested, and what is submerged are peanuts, soybeans, millet, sugarcane, vegetables, melons, and fruits. Otherwise, the loss would be even greater. Due to the collapse of the Longwei Dike, the light railway between Shantou and Chenghai was submerged, and the water flooded the railway tracks near Ouding and Fulong by more than two feet. It has been impossible to pass for three days. The electric boat from Shantou to Chenghai Donglong also dared not travel due to the rapid current. Fortunately, the water has now receded slightly, and various places may not suffer significant losses. (August 5)</p>
<h3>Liaoning's Anti-Communist Alert is Tight</h3>
<p>Military and Police Hold Joint Defense Conference</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Since the alarming news of the Communist army's capture of Changsha spread, the whole country has been astonished. Although Liaoning is far away, it is located on the frontier. There is deep fear that such elements may secretly send their partisans to infiltrate the hinterland and take the opportunity to cause disturbances. Moreover, the August 1st anniversary is approaching, and there is particular fear that lawless elements will take advantage of this to stir up trouble. Therefore, the Liaoning authorities have specially ordered the military and police organs in the province to rectify their defenses and strictly implement security measures to prevent accidents. In addition, the Northeast Gendarmerie Headquarters, the Liaoning Provincial Police Department, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau Detective Division, and the Shenyang County Public Security Bureau held a meeting at the Gendarmerie Headquarters on the first of this month. All important military and police personnel were present to discuss joint security measures. It was resolved that the temporary security of the provincial capital will be carried out by the Northeast Army's First Brigade Garrison, the Gendarmerie Headquarters, and the Public Security Bureau, which will send teams to distribute defenses, starting from August 1st. The temporary security will be limited to ten days for the time being, and martial law will be declared when necessary. As for the temporary security period, day and night defense methods are divided. 5:00 AM to 7:00 PM is daytime defense time, and 8:00 PM to 4:00 AM is nighttime defense time. During daytime defense, in addition to setting up checkpoints at key locations, patrols will also be conducted in the streets and markets, all with live ammunition and strict vigilance. During nighttime defense, in addition to the military and police on duty at checkpoints still wearing uniforms and fully armed, the military and police performing other duties will wear plain clothes and secretly contact each other in case of emergencies, in order to respond quickly. In addition, the Gendarmerie Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau will assign 30 military police, 10 security team members, and 20 police officers to form temporary patrol teams, divided into day and night groups, to patrol various locations, with ten shifts rotating without interruption.

<h3>Zhejiang Province Increases Provincial Public Debt Fund</h3>
<p>Designates Overdue Land Tax Fines as Second Guarantee</p>
<p>Previously, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to handle post-war military affairs and consolidate old debts, had issued two public debts for post-war consolidation and reorganization, both designating the increased price of Liangzhe salt catty as the principal repayment fund. In the seventeenth year, another 6 million yuan of public debt was issued to repay old debts, which would continue to designate the original salt catty price increase income of more than 1.3 million yuan per year as the principal and interest repayment fund after the maturity of the principal repayment of the two post-war consolidation and reorganization public debts. Over the years, the principal and interest have been repaid on schedule, and the credit has been outstanding. However, since last year, salt taxes in various places have been drastically reduced due to bandit disturbances or the rampant smuggling. The price increase of salt in Wenzhou and Chu has also been reduced by half, resulting in a significant reduction in the salt catty price increase designated as the fund for the three public debts of post-war consolidation and debt repayment in this province. The Department of Finance believes that if no other compensation measures are found for this fund, it will be difficult to allocate the principal and interest on time, which will not only damage the government's credit but also hinder the progress of new debts, with a great impact on finance. It is urgent to find ways to maintain it to avoid delays. It was found that the item of overdue fines for land tax compensation has no fixed amount in previous years and has not been included in the budget. The average calculation is about more than 100,000 yuan per year. Yesterday, a proposal was specially submitted to the Provincial Government meeting to use all of this fine income as the second guarantee for public debt to compensate. The proposal was approved by the Provincial Government meeting. Local Dispatch</p>

The resolution was passed and submitted to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Re-election of County Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The terms of office of the officials of the local County Chamber of Commerce have expired and should be re-elected in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law promulgated by the National Government. On the afternoon of the tenth, the votes were counted in public, and the fifteen elected executive committee members were Cai Guangyao, Shu Bao Shan, Zhou Tingzhen, Zhang Fucun, Pan Guoping, Zhang Ruoshui, Yang Zhimin, Ding Zhouzhi, Xie Jingshan, Wu Shengyong, Yang Wenhua, Tang Zhimin, Wu Zai Su, Shen Si Nan, and Wang Zuoting. The supervisory committee members were Du Yingchang, Feng Shouhu, Wang Xianglin, Hong Songqiao, Fang Zhongqiao, and Wang Liangqing.</p>
<p>Fengxian</p>
<h3>County Magistrate's Illegal Handling of Escaped Prisoners</h3>
<p>The Fengxian prisoners' escape was recorded in this newspaper's major events. Later, County Magistrate Shen executed two recaptured escaped prisoners, Wang A Bao and Zhang A Da, in the name of the County Government. The Executive Committee of the First District Party Department of the county stated that since County Magistrate Shen took office, he has neither improved the local area nor competed to destroy it, and the people's resentment is very deep. This time, the execution of the two prisoners did not announce the charges, nor did it request approval from the Provincial Government. It was indeed a dictatorial execution, which was a private and playful act. Murderer. A special request was made to the County Executive Committee to investigate the matter thoroughly. The text roughly said: According to the investigation, as of July 17th, a total of 58 people had escaped. 26 of them were killed on the spot or drowned, 14 were recaptured (including two who have been executed). 18 are at large. Another one, A Mei, who sold cakes, was mistakenly killed. However, on the morning of July 22nd, the recaptured escaped prisoner Wang A Bao was escorted to the left side of the Sanguantang Temple and executed by shooting in the name of the County Government. According to outside rumors, Wang was the chief culprit. On the afternoon of the 22nd, another escaped prisoner, Zhang A Da, who had been shot and wounded, was captured and interrogated. On the morning of the 23rd, he was also carried on a palm mat to the back of the First Water Patrol Team and executed by shooting by order of the County Government. According to outside rumors, Zhang was also the chief culprit. This time, the County Government resolutely acted according to military law, or because the two prisoners' crimes were serious and the law was unforgivable. However, as of the 27th, the charges against the two prisoners have not been announced, which has raised doubts about the legal principles: (1) If County Magistrate Shen concurrently serves as a military judge, why have the charges not been announced for many days after the recaptured escaped prisoners were executed? (2) The County Government has no power to execute prisoners dictatorially. If it is believed that the prisoners should be sentenced to death, it must also telegraph the Provincial Government for instructions. Then, its unauthorized killing of prisoners is inevitably a private act and a play on the law. In his mind, he disregards the decrees of the National Government and the orders of the Provincial Government. His absurd behavior is not what an official under the Qingbai banner should do.</p>
<h3>Busiest Are Running Around Requesting Joint Issuance</h3>
<p>The time for the issuance of busy silver vouchers above the village level in this county coincides with the fifth and sixth months of the year, when there are widespread famines. Most businesses are unable to respond due to livelihood constraints. Some even owe until the winter grain shipment before settling. However, the supervisors in charge of collecting taxes have set deadlines that cannot be delayed, causing the micro-economic villages to be in a difficult position. Therefore, the village leaders, represented by Jiang Sanjing of Fang 13, submitted a statement of the previous situation, requesting that the busy silver vouchers above the village level be issued jointly with the busy opening of the village below. However, it is understood that the county government believes that there are indeed many valid reasons stated in this case, but because the case has been opened, it is not convenient to change it. Therefore, yesterday, it was approved to continue to follow the previous example and pay according to the deadline.</p>

<h3>More Bandits Arriving at Qianjiawei</h3>
<p>Qianjiawei was originally a place where bandits hid. Suddenly, on the evening of the seventh, more than a hundred bandits arrived, spreading all over the streets. They were all armed and were said to have come from Luwan Temple in Zhejiang Province because the bandits had received advance notice that the Xincang Provincial Security Team was coming to suppress them. It was also heard that the anti-smuggling team discovered many bandits in the southeast of Liujia Yanqiao the other day. The two sides opened fire for a short time, and the bandits all fled. When the fire broke out, an old woman surnamed Mou, who was drying sauce on the scene, was hit in the abdomen by a stray bullet and has now died.</p>

<h3>Petition to Change the Method of Collecting Busy Grain</h3>
<p>The Department of Finance of Wu County approved the collection of various donations with the busy grain for the 19th year, including a local subsidy fee of 45 cents per tael of busy silver, a county road construction mu tax of 50 cents, a Jun Song fee of 20 cents per tael of less busy silver, a county public security fee of 35 cents, a county road construction mu tax of 50 cents, and the following with each stone of grain, a local subsidy fee of 1 yuan, a county public security fee of 70 cents, a security group fee of 50 cents, an education mu tax of 1.3 yuan, an agricultural improvement mu tax of 24 cents, and a local subsidy mu tax of 1.115 yuan. The total is 3.92225 yuan per tael of provincial and county taxes for busy silver, 3.19225 yuan per tael of less busy silver, and 10.115 yuan per stone of grain. However, the collection date has always been the busy silver first, and then the less busy grain is collected at a fixed date. Now the Finance Bureau plans to change the plan to collect the less busy grain at the same time and has submitted a request to the department for instructions.</p>
<h3>Telegram to Qidong Bandit Police</h3>

First, they completely released more than 100 prisoners held in two prisons. Then, they set fire to the two prisons. The county police team fought with the bandits in the streets, killing one bandit and three escaped prisoners and capturing more than 20 escaped prisoners. The bandits were defeated and fled. The High Court has sent Wu Cheng, a trial officer from Chongming County, to investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Zheng Wenxuan Requests to Establish a Cleaning Donation</h3>
<p>When the Suzhou land covering industry had a labor dispute, it took three months to resolve. Now that the dispute has been resolved, Zheng Wenxuan and others have submitted a petition to the county party, arguing that the industry is not a commercial transaction and requesting the official office to set up a bureau to manage the collection of cleaning donations (approximately more than 10,000 yuan per year) to subsidize education construction funds. Now the county party has forwarded it to the county government to be reviewed by the General Chamber of Commerce, and Zheng and others submitted another petition to the provincial office yesterday, requesting the county to follow suit.</p>

<h3>Banditry in Shizhuang Town, Many Deaths from Robbery of Weapons</h3>
<p>Shizhuang Town in Taohua Township, west of the county, is located at the junction of Cheng and Wu and has long been a place for bandits to come and go. After County Magistrate Li led a team to the countryside to suppress them the other day, the bandits harbored resentment. At about 1:00 AM on the 9th, they gathered more than 200 bandits, armed with guns, first went to Ma Kou Li Village and searched the home of Jin Shanghang, the former director of the township administration, and shot Jin Shanghang in the buttocks, injuring his urethra and endangering his life. His aunt, niece, and nephew, Jin Bangjun, were all shot. Jin Chengqing and Jin Yuanlin, wealthy households in the village, were shot and killed, and an old woman also died. Then they went to Shizhuang Street to rob the Public Security Sixth Branch Police Station, losing two guns and killing a police officer named Wang Hengxing. Baofeng Rice Shop, Xiangji Hotel, and Jin Yuelai Longyuan Tea Shops were all robbed. After the bandits robbed, they went to Guanzhuang to burn it down. At that time, the police team in the city had been ordered to go to the countryside and came from Huangtan and other places. They encountered the bandits and the two sides fought fiercely. The police team was outnumbered and retreated to Ligang. In the afternoon, they hurried to the city to report to the county government. In the evening, County Magistrate Li led a team to the countryside himself to suppress the bandits and to survey the scene where Jin Shanghang and others were injured. Five people were sent to the Eastern Outer Gospel Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Security Team Detains Robbers</h3>
<p>Jin Jiarui, the head of the first squad of the East Outer District Security Team, reported that the robbers Zhu Yuanlang and Zhao Laosi, etc., who were involved in the robbery case of Zhou Xiaogao's house in Fangjia Pond, were hiding in Wangfu. He led a team to arrest them and escorted them to the First District Regiment Headquarters. Because it is now a time of martial law, they are under the jurisdiction of Commander Yang of the Fortress for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Commander Yang Issues a Proclamation to Maintain Order</h3>
<p>Commander Yang of the Fortress issued a proclamation yesterday, saying: "For the purpose of the proclamation, I received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Jiang of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and I understand the two telegrams from Kai Zhi and Hao Shen. The wounded soldiers in the Twenty-fifth Rear Hospital are causing trouble, and their behavior in the area is illegal. If they are not strictly cracked down on, there will be concerns about the local security. Now, all the garrisoned military police in Cheng County are under the command of Commander Yang to guard the hospital and maintain order. The commander shall plan and allocate accordingly. If the wounded soldiers continue to cause trouble arbitrarily and refuse to obey orders, the commander shall be allowed to handle them at his own discretion. In addition to sending telegrams separately, a special telegram is sent for compliance." Upon receiving this order, I checked that it is the duty of soldiers to fight against rebellion, sacrifice for the party and the country, and it is their duty. Now that they are injured and recuperating in the hospital, they should abide by military discipline and maintain their reputation. However, some ignorant wounded soldiers are acting recklessly in groups of three or five, causing trouble in the area, and even using guns to rob guns and become thugs. Such actions are indeed abominable. After this proclamation, if any wounded soldiers do not abide by military discipline and act lawlessly, they will be severely punished once they are caught, and even punished by military law. This commander's words are the law, do not say that I did not warn you! Obey and do not violate, be sure to be sure.</p>

<h3>Perpetrator in Boat With Four Deaths Case Executed by Shooting</h3>
<p>Xu Jianshan, a villager in Xuxiang, Kaihua Township, Xi County, hired Shao Qiaosheng's boat in the spring of this year to transport money, rice, and sundries to Dongshan, Dongting, Taihu Lake. On the way, he was robbed and Xu Jianshan and the boatman Shao Qiaosheng's father and son were killed, a boat with four lives. Later, Ni Gusheng, the captain of the Second Water Police District Detective Team, purchased an informant named Qian Genbao and assisted the police officers in arresting the main perpetrators in this case, Zhao Shansheng, Chen Jisheng, Qin Da Wang, and others in the Shuibei area of Guangfu, Su County, as well as two suspects, Qian Guanbao and Wang Qiaosheng, and three stolen boats. There were several women and children on the boat. After repeated trials, Zhao Shansheng and others confessed that on April 22 of this year, in the Jiaozui area of Taihu Lake, they and Chen Changsheng, Chen Jinsheng, Liu Fucai, and others, who were at large, drove two fishing boats to chase and rob Xu Jianshan's boat. The boatman Shao Qiaosheng fought back with the helm handle and fell into the lake because he used too much force. Zhao used a pole to stab Shao into a hole and sink him to his death. Then, Chen Jinsheng and Liu Fucai, who were at large, used poles to poke holes in Xu Jianshan and Shao Qiaosheng's sons, Guoqing and Qiqing, and sink them to their deaths. County Magistrate Sun reported the situation to the provincial government, and on the afternoon of the other day (9th), he received a telegram from the provincial government approving the execution of the bandit Zhao Shansheng, Yang Jisheng, and Qin Da Wang. County Magistrate Sun immediately signed the order to bring the bandits to verify their identities and tie them to the South School Field for execution by shooting.</p>
<h3>Director of Finance Bureau Resigns</h3>
<p>Chen Liangdong, Director of the Finance Bureau, resigned because the autumn harvest in Xi County was poor last year, and the spring and summer cocoons and wheat were poor this year, resulting in an unusually low tax revenue. Compared with previous years, there was a large shortage. It was difficult to pay the provincial funds, and the county funds were also heavily burdened. Yesterday, he submitted a special report to the department in person to explain the difficulties and request to resign. At the same time, Chen Zhanru, the chairman of the County Fund Management Office, also submitted a resignation to the county government, saying that the local expenses were in huge deficit and on the verge of bankruptcy, while the funds to be paid were still coming in, making it difficult to cope. He also requested that Director Hua Shaochun temporarily maintain the office affairs.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Guild Refuses to Give Subsidy</h3>
<p>The County General Labor Union Consolidation Committee previously stated that the local Rickshaw Association had promised to subsidize the union's regular expenses by 100 yuan per month, which had not been paid for two years. Now, the union is experiencing financial difficulties and has submitted a request to the county government to recover the funds. County Magistrate Sun immediately sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce to inform the union. Now, the Chamber of Commerce has received a reply from the rickshaw stating that the Rickshaw Association has been reorganized and the guild has decided that all unreasonable distributions cannot be recognized. The health and medical expenses of the rickshaw pullers have also been specially contracted with Tongren Hospital to be responsible for treating all rickshaw pullers who go to the hospital free of charge. Now that commerce is declining, there are no surplus funds to subsidize any external organizations. The Chamber of Commerce has reported the situation to the county government.</p>

<h3>Kidnapping Case Occurs in Yahe Town</h3>
<p>More than a dozen bandits arrived in Yahe Town, west of Wu County, at about 11:00 PM on the 8th. They were wearing short white cloth shirts and black Xiangyun gauze pants, all holding box guns and pistols. First, they robbed the Wudan Tax Branch Office of all tax funds, more than 670 yuan, and more than a hundred pieces of soft clothes and accessories from each staff member. Then, they went to the homes of Chen Baosheng, a tax office servant, and Wang Kunsheng of Yuyuan Heng Cloth Shop to rob, causing huge losses. Because Wang Kunsheng's family did not get a large amount of property, they also stripped his child, Zhang Bao, naked and took him away. The city police brigade headquarters heard the news and Captain Chen Daxix immediately sent Wang, the deputy captain, and Liu, the special affairs officer, to lead the team to encircle and arrest them. At about 4:00 AM on the morning of the 9th, they discovered a suspicious person while encircling and searching. After arresting him, he claimed to be Wang Dajiang. He was taken to Zheng Xiqi, a Liaoning native in Yahe, who greeted Wang Da, and he was also arrested. Then, Liu Laoer, a person who looked at wood rafts along the canal, was also arrested and taken to Yahe. The victim of the robbery identified Wang Da as the perpetrator who had bound the staff and kidnapped Wang Kunsheng's child that night. The team escorted the arrested criminals to the city by wheel at about 6:00 AM and are currently being interrogated.</p>
<h3>The Massacre in Makou Village, Cheng County and Shizhuang</h3>
<p>Makou Village in Jiangyin County is very close to the boundary of Wujin County. On the 2nd of this month, Jin Shanghang, the former director of the Taohua Township Administration, led many people to Guanzhuang and other places to arrest bandits. Therefore, the bandits harbored resentment. In addition, Li Leng, the county magistrate of the county, and Li Zonggang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, had led a team to Guanzhuang to arrest the bandit leader Liu Hongxi in the Xia Gang robbery case. Therefore, the bandits hated the people of Makou Village even more for guiding the capture. At dawn on the 9th, more than 100 bandits, each wearing white short shirts and pants, led a military horn to Makou Village and opened fire to demonstrate. Then, they wantonly shot and killed people and did the same in nearby Shizhuang. However, they did not rob property. Then, the Xishiqiao Merchant Group and the Public Security Bureau rushed to suppress them. They encountered the bandits on the way and the two sides opened fire. The bandits ran out of ammunition and began to disperse. Two bandits were killed by the police. In Makou Village and Shizhuang, there were many deaths and injuries. According to investigations, the deceased were Yang Dinggui's wife, Jin Ronglin, Jin Ronghai, Jin Qisheng, Jin Chengqing, Jin Qianqing, Jin Yuqing, and others. The injured are being sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Telephone Dispute Between the Two Sides Has Reached Extremes</h3>
<p>Recently, telephone users have repeatedly held meetings and contacted each user to stamp the documents in order to submit them to the company and request the removal of their machines because the telephone company canceled preferential treatment starting on July 1. On the 8th, the company also held a board meeting, and as a result, Manager Wu Yaochen went to the county government to reply. Now, the users are still actively holding meetings and stamping the documents, and it seems that they have no intention of accepting mediation. The major shareholders of the company, such as Yu, Shen, and Bu, have all left Chang County, so the discussions at the meeting have not been satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<h3>Interrogation of Sea Bandit Forced Occupancy of Women Case</h3>
<p>The county sent personnel to Haimen to welcome and bring back the sea bandit Liu Anbang the other day. At 11:00 AM on the morning of the other day, the victim Shen Xu came to the government to report the case. Cen, the trial officer, interrogated her. The woman stated that she was 25 years old and lived in Hupu. Her husband's name was Yunsheng and he supported a boat in Shanghai. She had a daughter named Xiao Erzi, who was seven years old. In the autumn of last year, Liu Anbang and others came to her house to rob her and raped her. Then, she was kidnapped to the boat for three months. In the spring of this year, she was rescued after the police arrested Liu Anquan, who had been shot to death. On May 28, Liu Anbang came to rob her again. She opened the door and escaped, and Liu went into the room and snatched her daughter. Now that the case has been solved, she is asking for her daughter to be returned to her. Then, Xiao Erzi, who was seven years old, was interrogated. The official ordered Xiao Erzi to identify what Shen Xu called her. Xiao Erzi replied that she called her "Mom." Then, Liu Anbang was interrogated and said that he was 46 years old and from Yancheng. He asked his wife Shen Xu to request the court to investigate the matter clearly so that he could die in peace. The official ordered Shen Xu to testify and still stated that she was not Liu's wife and was indeed forced to occupy her. Then, Shen Han was interrogated and said that her son's name was Yunsheng and he married a daughter-in-law named Qian. The official ordered Shen Han to make a statement to prove that Xiao Erzi would be handed over to Shen Xu to take back. Liu Anbang was taken back for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Problem of Adding Rickshaws for Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>The local Rickshaw Pullers' Union submitted a proposal to add rickshaws last month and was approved by the County Party Department to send a letter to the county. The county government submitted it to the County Government Meeting, which resolved and approved it by the Construction Department, allowing 60 rickshaws to be added first. The rickshaw capitalist group Tai Zhang and six other companies, seeing that the rickshaw pullers were adding rickshaws themselves and wanted to get involved, repeatedly contacted the workers, but were rejected. It is heard that the company plans to send a telegram to the Provincial Department to request that it be prevented.</p>

<h3>Police Officer Robs Pig Buyer</h3>
<p>On the 7th, Tai Xingzhu, a pig buyer, Ding Shaolan, was carrying 283 yuan when he returned to his hometown from Shenyang. He landed at Xingang and walked home. When he reached the Shengjia Wei of Henan, Jijiashi, two people resembling soldiers came face to face and held a box cannon, ordering him to stop. They grabbed all the money Ding was carrying. Afterwards, Ding went to Captain Wang of the County Police Detachment stationed in Jijiashi to report the incident and said that the two people looked very much like the police officers of your team. Upon receiving the report, Captain Wang immediately gathered all the team members to let him identify them. Ding pointed out that Zhu Guangyou, a second-class police officer of the Second Detachment, was indeed one of the perpetrators. Captain Wang searched him and found 144 yuan of silver, which he confessed to conspiring with Xue Rongquan, a second-class police officer of the same team, to commit the robbery. Xue had already divided the money and fled. Captain Wang believed that the police officers were soldiers and were responsible for protecting the safety of the people. They dared to commit such illegal acts, which was a heinous crime. He escorted Zhu Guangyou to the city and sent Sun Zhonglin, a special affairs officer of the Third Detachment, overnight with Chen, a special affairs officer of the Second Detachment, to strictly investigate and arrest the fleeing police officer Xue Rongquan. Last night, he caught Xue at the Xinshunxing Hotel. Xue was entertaining prostitutes and found 131 yuan of stolen silver. He was immediately escorted to the county. After being interrogated by Investigator Yin, he was handcuffed and imprisoned to await legal action.</p>

<h3>Ferry Manager Accused</h3>
<p>The Second Sub-branch of the Third District Party Department in Guazhou Town of this county stated that the Pujin Ferry is jointly operated by Jiangdu, Yizheng, and Zhenjiang counties, with Zhenjiang as the main entity. It operates daily between Shierxu, Guazhou, Liuxu, and Zhenjiang, with only one ferry. Whenever repairs are needed, it is replaced with a red boat. However, this time, due to the collapse of the riverbank in Liuxu, the damage to the ferry has not been promptly repaired, nor has it been replaced with a red boat, causing great inconvenience to passengers. Furthermore, when the ferry was affected by the riverbank collapse in Liuxu, passengers fell into the water and drowned. The recovered bodies were not photographed or claimed. The manager of the ferry company, Lu Jinquan, disregarded this. Therefore, the District Party Department requested the County Party Department to consult the County Court for legal action.</p>

<p>Xiba is located in the third district of Huaiyin, on the south bank of the Yan River and the north bank of the Yellow River, stretching about four miles from east to west and one mile from north to south. There are eighteen or nineteen salt depots, serving as a storage and transit point for salt from northern Jiangsu. The salt authorities have always stationed a battalion or large brigade of anti-smuggling troops in the town to prevent salt smuggling. Currently, the First Brigade of the Huaihai Anti-Smuggling Water Police is stationed in the town, with its bases not in one place. One part of it is stationed near the Qianfu Salt Depot. Yesterday (the 7th) at 7 PM, this part of the water police suddenly mutinied. The local merchants and residents were immediately startled by the sound of gunfire and were terrified. In addition to the First Brigade of the Water Police, there were also patrol teams and salt escort teams stationed in the town. The Third Sub-bureau of the Huaiyin Public Security Bureau was also located in the town below Yangjia Wharf. Upon hearing the news, the Third Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, the patrol team, and the escort team also temporarily gathered to devise ways to defend and suppress the mutiny. Sub-bureau Chief Wu Yinchuan sent someone to report to the County Bureau in the county town and to the headquarters of the 266th Regiment of the 133rd Brigade of the garrison troops. Immediately, the police brigade of the Public Security Bureau and the Third Battalion of the 266th Regiment dispatched teams overnight to suppress the mutiny. The mutineers dared to resist and opened fire, and the two sides fought for about half an hour. One mutineer was killed and three were injured. The mutineers were defeated and fled to the north bank of the Yan River and the south bank of the Yellow River. Government troops pursued and suppressed them in separate directions. According to someone who came to the city this morning (the 8th) from Langshi Town on the north bank of the Yan River, about forty mutineering water police officers had been overtaken by government troops in Langshi, and the situation was serious as they were being rounded up. There was no news of other government troops pursuing the defeated mutineers arriving in the city. Public Security Bureau Chief Zhao Zhenhua and Police Brigade Chief Zhu Lianfang had also not yet arrived in the county town. As for the cause of the water police mutiny, there were many rumors. Some said that dozens of plainclothes ruffians came to rob, and the water police were accomplices. Others said that the water police had gone down the Yan River a few days ago to suppress bandits and disobeyed their superiors, and the superiors reported this to prepare for punishment, so they launched the mutiny first. The latter explanation was more widely accepted, and it was not without reason. Fortunately, when the mutiny began, all parties took early precautions, and the area did not suffer widespread destruction.</p>

<h3>Negotiation on Hangzhou-Shanghai Long-Distance Telephone</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou-Shanghai long-distance telephone line was disconnected due to complex internal disagreements between the Zhejiang Long-Distance Telephone Management Office of the Ministry of Communications and the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau. This has been going on for nearly a month. It is reported that the Ministry's Telephone Office said that if the provincial authorities do not fully pay according to the original terms, the line will not be restored. This problem will be delayed indefinitely.</p>
<h3>Trouble Caused by Wounded Soldiers Buying Goods in Jianqiao</h3>
<p>At about 10 AM today (the 10th), several wounded soldiers from the rear army general hospital of the Jianqiao general headquarters went to the Yushengyong grocery store in Jianqiao town to buy perfume essence. Because they used the new double-horn coin of the 90th year of the Republic, the store refused to accept it, and the two sides argued. The local police were trying to resolve the situation, but they were dissatisfied, causing a major conflict. More and more wounded soldiers gathered, and some even snatched the police's weapons. The police fired a warning shot to defend themselves, but it accidentally injured five soldiers (it is said that one of them was seriously injured and may die). All the shops in the town closed their doors. The police station was also completely destroyed by the wounded soldiers, with losses of more than 2,000 yuan. Deputy Director Cai of the hospital was present to suppress the situation but was ineffective. He telegraphed the provincial government and the provincial capital's public security bureau. Chief Zhu of the Security Division and Director Yan of the Public Security Bureau dispatched a company of instructors and a team of joint military and police inspectors, led by Qi Xiaofeng and Wu Ding, to Jianqiao by car to suppress the situation and investigate the truth of the incident.</p>
<p>Pinghu</p>
<h3>Scheduled Start of Construction of North Temple Twin Pagodas</h3>
<p>The twin pagodas in Pinghu North Temple (i.e., Dezang Temple) were in disrepair for many years and were on the verge of collapse. The Property Association and other agencies had proposed demolition, while local elders advocated repair, leading to many disputes. Last month, the Civil Affairs Department sent Zhang Tinghua to Pinghu to conduct a detailed investigation and to establish a repair agreement with those who advocated repair. Mo Mengkao and others were responsible for raising funds. It is now known that the funds have been secured and construction is scheduled to begin at the end of the month. The design has been finalized, and the foundation will be built with cement, surrounded by iron chains.</p>
<h3>Reconstruction of Pinghu City Streets</h3>
<p>The styles of the streets inside and outside Pinghu City are old and narrow. The county government has drafted a reconstruction plan and submitted it to the Construction Committee for revision and approval, divided into four grades: first-class main lines 28 feet wide, second-class 18 feet wide, third-class branch lines 16 feet wide, and fourth-class alleys 10 feet wide.</p>
<h3>Former County Chief Escorted to Jin Province</h3>
<p>After the new County Chief Fang Zhuangyou entered the government office, he asked the former County Chief Fang Li to handle the handover. After the new County Chief took office, he planned to follow the Department's order and escort the former County Chief to the province at 1 PM. The new secretary, Zhu Wenbo, requested permission for the former County Chief to go to Hangzhou on his own within three days to report to the Civil Affairs Department. The new County Chief then telegraphed the Department to request instructions. The Department replied by telegram, ordering that he be escorted to the province immediately to await further instructions. The new County Chief followed the order and yesterday (the 8th) sent Pan Zhen, the Section Chief of the Second Section, to accompany the former County Chief Fang to Jin Province to await disposal.</p>
<h3>Another Kidnapping and Ransom Case in Xincang</h3>
<p>Gu Xinrong's family in Beifanggang Village, Xincang, received a letter from bandits the day before yesterday, demanding a loan of 1,500 silver dollars. Gu ignored it because he could not afford it. The next day, seven or eight armed bandits kidnapped Xinrong's son and fled northeast. There has been no news of him so far.</p>
<p>Huzhou</p>
<h3>Bandits Who Enter Softly and Leave Forcefully</h3>
<p>In Yejiabang, near Mayao Town in Huzhou, Ye Jing'an, a wealthy man, was robbed by seven or eight thieves around 2 AM on the night of the 31st of last month. They dug a hole in the western wall and entered, holding knives and sticks, with cloths covering their faces and speaking with local accents. They dragged Ye Jing'an out of bed, held a knife to his neck, and threatened him to hand over silver dollars. Ye repeatedly begged in vain. The bandits searched the rooms at will, looting clothes, jewelry, silk, and more, as well as over 400 silver dollars in cash, taking over an hour. Ye's family suffered losses of over 2,000 yuan this time.</p>
<h3>Wuxing Wins Three Awards at the West Lake Exposition</h3>
<p>When the West Lake Exposition opened last year, a special commissioner was sent to Huzhou to solicit exhibits. The Wuxing County Chamber of Commerce collected various local products, totaling seventy or eighty kinds. Tan Cheng's ink paintings were also requested by the commissioner to be displayed. After the closing of the exposition, all the items were returned, but only three kinds won excellent awards and medals. One was Tan's painting. It is said that Hu Wenrui and Fei Lianqing's pens and Mei Hengyu Silk Factory's silk from Nanxun each won a colorful gold medal. A letter has been sent to the County Chamber of Commerce in this city urging the exhibitors to claim them.</p>
<p>Kaihua</p>
<h3>Delineation of Boundaries Between Kaihua and Xiuning</h3>
<p>The boundary dispute between Kaihua in Zhejiang Province and Xiuning in Anhui Province has been repeatedly surveyed but has not been resolved. When the Ministry of Interior sent a commission for surveying last year, Zhejiang Province stated that the unclear boundary had implications for all administrative matters, and it was originally intended to use the natural watershed of Majin Ridge as the boundary. The Ministry Commission also expressed approval. However, the issue was not finalized because the boundary survey regulations had not been promulgated, and the original situation was maintained. Now, another survey is about to take place. Upon hearing this, the people of Kaihua learned that one or two local bullies in Xiuning, disregarding the natural terrain and administrative convenience, were plotting to seize Kaihua's inherent territory to satisfy their desire for money. Public sentiment was aroused. It is reported that various people's organizations and legal groups are gathering and will make major representations. It is also reported that they have telegraphed the Ministry of Interior and the Provincial Government, vowing to fight to the death.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Plans to Use Land Tax as Self-Generated Funds</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Municipal Government believes that the land survey in this city is about to be completed, and a land tax should be implemented as soon as possible to issue public bonds for water supply. Since the Land Law has been passed and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, it is proposed to proceed quickly and use this as the funding for the water supply public bonds.</p>
<h3>Explosion of Steam Cylinder in Electric Light Company</h3>
<p>At about 9 PM last night (the 8th), the Yongyao Electric Light Company outside the North Gate of Ningbo suddenly had an explosion of the steam cylinder, and all the lights in the city went out completely, creating a scene of darkness. The citizens were all panicked. The Public Security Bureau, to prevent petty thieves from taking advantage of the opportunity to cause trouble, ordered all stations to send out more police officers to maintain order. The company is now sending workers to repair it. It is said that the lights will be restored as usual tonight.</p>
<h3>Farmhouse Robbed</h3>
<p>He Xiangxian, a farmer in Fengyang Village, Lingyan District, Zhenhai, is known for his diligence and has some savings. Around midnight the night before last, nine robbers suddenly came, holding wooden shell guns and pikes, and broke into the house, looting a large amount of cash, totaling 45 silver dollars, 54 yuan in cash, and valuable jewelry worth over 300 yuan.</p>

Currently, Xiaoshan, Linpu, Jianshan, and Xinjiangkou are directly connected to the General Bureau. Two bridges from Xixing to Zhuji, namely the Jianshan River Bridge and the Zhuqiao River Bridge, began construction on the 23rd of last month and are scheduled to be completed in one month. The first section of earthwork will be completed by the end of August.</p>

In addition to 40,000 yuan each assigned to the southern and eastern townships, 20,000 yuan each was assigned to the northwest townships, and 40,000 yuan was assigned to the urban area.

The higher authorities are urging payment. Yesterday, the County Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to each subscriber, requiring them to pay within ten days.</p>
<p>Tianchang</p>
<h3>County Party Department Ordered to Cease Activities</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Tianchang County Party Department in Anhui Province, Chu Zhaorui, Zhu Song, and others, was deemed to have been established rashly without completing the legal procedures at the 44th meeting of the Provincial Executive Committee. Now, the Provincial Party Department has ordered the county magistrate to stop giving party fees and cease activities, stating that Chu Zhaorui, Zhu Song, and others of the County Party Department were illegally selected after the 20th item of the 44th meeting of the Provincial Executive Committee and should be invalid according to law. Moreover, Chu and Zhu opposed the Third National Congress and were removed from party membership. The Executive Committee of the county has been abolished and is awaiting processing. Upon receiving the telegram, it is necessary to stop the party fees.</p>

<h3>Recent Situation of Fundraising by the Yun Jian Native Place Association in Beijing</h3>

The first batch of reports on the fundraising performance includes eight teams with a total of 3,075 silver dollars. The other teams are still actively working on it. The total amount will be considerable. The association originally planned to purchase land to build a clubhouse, but because there are two existing large buildings that are quite suitable and located in the busy area of Zhongshan Road in the new capital, covering a large area, it is more cost-effective than building on their own. Therefore, the association has changed its original plan and is considering purchasing one. The first batch of donation amounts is recorded on the left:</p>

<h3>Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia Win Open Doubles Championship</h3>
<p>Three to Two... Defeat Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang</p>
<p>丨 Consecutive Wins in the Last Three Sets 丨 Come From Behind 丨</p>
<p>The sensational Shanghai Open Doubles Tennis Championship has been in full swing since the start of the battle. The heroes took to the stage and competed with each other. Those who stood out in the final scene yesterday were Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia against Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang. The three, Qiu, Jiang, and Lin, are national players in the Chinese tennis world, and Zheng is also known for being handsome and promising. The final meeting of famous generals and heroes is not only consistent with the reputations of both sides, but also feels like a mutual wish fulfillment. In the midst of the battle, Qiu and Jiang unfortunately suffered a tragic defeat in the great cause that was about to be completed, while Lin and Zheng, who were worried about the impending failure, suddenly came up with unexpected success. One sorrow and one joy can be imagined. The result of the game was three to two, Lin and Zheng won. Referee: Shen Siliang.</p>
<h3>A Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity</h3>
<p>Both sides have outstanding skills and famous names. They have a considerable understanding of each other and mutual respect. However, because there is rarely a chance to compare, it is not easy to strongly distinguish their strengths. Since participating, they knew that there would be yesterday's meeting. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The four players do not know whether they can meet again in the arena on this day next year. The opportunity is rare. How can the thousands of spectators enjoy the visual feast again and see the heroes of the world show their skills as they did yesterday? In short, yesterday's battle can be described as an unprecedented event in the history of Chinese tennis.</p>
<p>First Set... Eight to Ten</p>
<h3>Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>The famous generals stepped onto the stage with great power. High-pressure and low-pressure shots each have their own strengths. Lin Baohua served first, with formidable power. Zheng Zhaojia assisted as needed, with great success. Before long, the first game was easily obtained. When it came to Jiang Daozhang's serve, it was fierce and powerful, coupled with a good backhand, he won the second game. The third game belonged to Lin and Zheng, and the fourth game belonged to Qiu and Jiang. In short, the serving group, whether it was Lin and Zheng or Qiu and Jiang, benefited. Afterwards, ups and downs corresponded, such as one to one, two to two, three to three, four to four, five to five, becoming an unchanging rule. However, Lin and Zheng took the lead because of the first serve.</p>
<h3>Failure to Fall into the Trap</h3>
<p>After five-five, there was a sudden change. When Zheng served, Qiu and Jiang used tricks to take advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness and lobbed the ball to the rear. Zheng failed because of this, and the momentum of ups and downs was broken. Qiu and Jiang took the lead with six to five. Who knew that Qiu also lost because of a weak serve and became a six-six tie again. Lin Baohua showed his power with his serve and won a game with four straight wins, retaking the lead. Jiang Daozhang pounced on the sheep like a hungry tiger, and it was irresistible, becoming a seven-seven tie again. Qiu Feihai's smashes were excellent, and Jiang Daozhang's forehand and backhand dominated. Lin and Zheng were exhausted from running around and fell into the trap (Qiu and Jiang took the lead with eight to seven). However, in the subsequent game, Qiu and Jiang did not handle it properly and were taken away by Lin and Zheng again (eight-eight tie). In the seventeenth game, Lang used supernatural and unpredictable skills to beat the opponent and leave them at a loss. At that time, Lin's serve was unable to save the situation. In the eighteenth game, Qiu and Jiang frequently shot at Zheng with their superior momentum, so they were able to win the first set with a score of ten to eight, as shown on the left.</p>
<p>Second Set... Four to Six</p>
<h3>One Breath</h3>
<p>Lin and Zheng took advantage of the serve, and Zheng's pressure shot was quite skillful. Therefore, the two complemented each other, and the first game was taken for their own. In the second game, the ball flew back and forth in the middle of the field, and the mutual shooting in the air was a spectacle. Lin and Zheng were faster and took the upper hand. They won two games in one breath, and the future looked promising and optimistic.</p>
<h3>Defeated Again</h3>
<p>When Lin and Zheng were in high spirits, they were suddenly attacked by the opponent. Jiang's backhand and high-pressure shot were strong and powerful. The random shots were very impressive, and the net shots in a busy life were also wonderful. Coupled with Qiu's composure, before long, the two-two tie was heard in the arena. However, since then, the two sides have been equally matched in their skills, and it has been difficult to distinguish the male from the female. After another four games, they became four-four ties. Qiu and Jiang worked harder and their aura suddenly became stronger. Lin and Zheng were defeated again, failing with four to six. The score is shown on the left.</p>
<p>Third Set... Six to Two</p>
<h3>Defeat the Strong First</h3>
<p>Qiu and Jiang won two consecutive sets, and their momentum was so overwhelming that it was not difficult to swallow the four wastelands and sweep the universe, and the championship title also had a sense of who else could get it other than me. When the third set started, Qiu and Jiang took the lead again. Relying on the power of the smash and high pressure, they won the first and second games. The audience's belief in Qiu and Jiang's victory was strengthened.</p>

<h3>Reverse Goes Smoothly</h3>
<p>After the third game, Qiu and Jiang's military morale was slack and their techniques were careless. They thought that fate belonged to them and seemed that they did not need to reject people thousands of miles away. Unexpectedly, Lin and Zheng fought hard against the water and were determined to restore their fate. Heaven rewarded their ambition and they succeeded in succession. Therefore, in the six games after that, Lin and Zheng turned the reverse smoothly and were invincible. As a result, they won with six to two. The score is shown on the left.</p>
<p>Finals (Five Shots)</p>
<p>Fourth Set... Six to Four</p>
<h3>Another Scene</h3>
<p>Lin and Zheng regained a set, and their morale was greatly comforted. Between offense and defense, they felt like they had come to life. In the first two games, Lin and Zheng repeatedly won. At that time, Qiu and Jiang cheered up, hoping to complete the task as soon as possible to avoid failure. Therefore, in a flash, it became a two-two tie again. After that, the situation was very tense. At first, Lin and Zheng took the lead with three to two, but suddenly Qiu and Jiang took the lead with four to three.</p>
<h3>Eternal Regret</h3>
<p>Qiu and Jiang had already gained the advantage of taking the lead, and it was appropriate to take advantage of the situation to complete the success. However, after a little hesitation, they became an eternal regret. Lin and Zheng were full of color and skill, and they succeeded in succession in three consecutive games, that is, they won the fourth set with six to four.</p>
<p>Fifth Set... Six to One</p>
<h3>Turn Defeat into Victory</h3>
<p>Both sides had equal wins and losses, and the championship belonged to whoever had the upper hand in this final scene. Lin Baohua was as lively as a dragon and tiger, and his shots were all wonderful. Zheng Zhaojia was careful and lively. Jiang Daozhang's techniques were chaotic, and Qiu Feihai's long-term strength was insufficient. The situation of each other gradually became clear during the exchange of shots. Lin and Zheng became better and better in the battle, while Qiu and Jiang were too decadent to bear. In the end, Lin and Zheng won with six to one, which felt quite easy. The score is shown on the left.</p>
<h3>Awards Ceremony and End of the War</h3>
<p>The war came to an end and the awards ceremony was held. Chairman Hu Xiansheng gave a speech and invited Mr. Hu Yunlai to give the awards. Lin and Zheng stepped forward to receive the awards amidst the cheers of the crowd, and applause broke out to congratulate them on their success.</p>
<h3>Heroes Each Have Their Own Strengths</h3>
<p>The four heroes who played yesterday each had their own strengths. Lin Baohua's serve was the most powerful, ranking first among the four. His net was quite varied. His performance in the first two sets was mediocre, and he only showed his heroic qualities in the last three sets. Qiu Feihai's strength lies in his ability to handle the situation well. He can do it well regardless of the forehand or backhand, but his weak serve is his lifelong weakness. Jiang Daozhang's performance in the first two sets was wonderful and can be described as his proud work. It is a pity that his subsequent mistakes were repeated, resulting in a tragic defeat. His merits were not enough to make up for his mistakes, which is regrettable. Zheng Zhaojia's performance yesterday has fully demonstrated his tennis talent and will be a promising hero in the future. His skills can be called top-notch, and his long-term strength is also quite formidable.</p>
<h3>Japan Sets New Record in Backstroke</h3>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Explains the Qualifications for University Admission</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an instruction to the Private Jinling University to explain the qualifications for university admission, stating that the qualifications for university admission must be graduation from a public or registered private senior high school. The so-called registered school refers to those that have been registered with the educational administrative authorities of each province and city and submitted to the Ministry for approval. The names of all private schools approved by the Ministry have been detailed in the appendix to the Ministry's Gazette, Volume 2, Issue 22. All private schools that have not been listed in the appendix, regardless of whether they have been registered with the education departments of each province and city, are not eligible to take the entrance examination for national, provincial, or registered private universities. Because many private schools in various places have been registered with the education departments of each province and city and submitted to the Ministry for filing, but have been returned for re-processing due to incomplete procedures, and have not been included in the appendix to the Gazette, in order to help the graduates of these schools to enter higher education, the universities are still allowed to refer to the previously issued list of public and registered private high schools in each province and city when enrolling students for the first semester of the 19th year, but this is limited to the first semester of the 19th year. Please comply with it.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains Procedures for Registering Overseas Chinese Schools</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to explain the procedures for registering overseas Chinese schools, instructed the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education, stating that after reviewing the submitted report, it was found that overseas Chinese schools are different in nature from ordinary private schools within the country. The registration procedures should be handled in accordance with the revised regulations of the Ministry for registering overseas Chinese schools. Article 1 of these regulations states: "Any citizen of the Republic of China residing in another country who establishes a school in that location must submit a report and two copies of accompanying documents from the founder or their representative to the local consulate for forwarding to the Ministry of Education for approval and registration." According to this article, there is no requirement for an overseas Chinese school to first organize a board of directors when applying for registration. If a board of directors is established, it can be reported in the Ministry-issued board of directors information form at the time the school applies for registration, and there is no need to follow the procedures stipulated in the regulations for private schools. A copy of the regulations is enclosed for your information and compliance.</p>

<p>Learned people should not be arrogant towards the uneducated, because learning is not innate. If you had not had the money to study when you were young, wouldn't you be just as ignorant as them?</p>
<p>Money, if used well, can bring benefits; if used poorly, it can bring harm. The same is true of love between men and women.</p>
<p>Half of the prostitutes in the world are indeed forced by food and clothing, and the other half are misled by vanity.</p>
<p>Negative people often lament that the world is full of thorns and has no room for them, while optimistic people often stride forward with their heads held high, feeling at ease everywhere.</p>
<p>Don't bully him because you are stronger than him, beware of those who are stronger than you bullying you.</p>
<p>Relieving epidemics is not as good as preventing them, preventing them is not as good as hygiene, and hygiene is not as good as reading, because without reading, there is no way to talk about hygiene.</p>
<p>Managing price controls to benefit the poor is a temporary solution to an urgent problem. Improving agricultural affairs to increase production is a fundamental solution and a way to enrich the country.</p>
<p>Don't always take advantage of others. You must know that if there are no benefits to be gained, people will not let you take advantage of them.</p>
<h3>On Hu Zijing</h3>
<p>— Fang Er</p>
<p>During the recent occupation of Changsha by the Communist army, those in the educational circles with connections to the party and government all escaped, except for Hu Zijing, the president of Hunan University, who was unable to escape and reportedly died.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu, named Yuan Tan, courtesy name Zijing, was from Xiangtan. He once passed the provincial examination. In the late Qing Dynasty, he founded Mingde School in Changsha. Huang Kecheng, Tan Zuan, Wang Zhengting, and others all served in the school at one time or another. The school was established nearly thirty years ago and is the earliest and most famous private school in Hunan, especially known for Hu's ability to raise funds and travel to the north and south.</p>
<p>Hu was known for his grand words and also had a reputation for competence. He was nearly sixty years old with white hair and beard. The educational circles in central Hunan all respected him as "Mr. Hu Jiu," just as the gentry circles in Changsha respected "Mr. Yu Jiu." Mr. Yu Jiu, named Yu Gaoqing, courtesy name Zhihua, was killed along with Ye Dehui as a notorious local tyrant before the split between the Kuomintang and the Communists in Hunan. Now Hu has also died in an unnatural death. Friends in Beijing all said that Mr. Hu had been very influential in the educational circles in Hunan in recent years. After taking over as president of the university, he also wanted to be a member of the provincial government and often boasted of being a teacher of Chairman He Yunqiao. Perhaps this is why he was resented by the enemy, but it is not certain.</p>
<p>In recent days, many people have come to Beijing from Hunan to petition for rescue and relief, all saying that Mr. Hu Zijing was killed, Mingde School was burned down, and the neighboring Zhou Nan Girls' School was also affected. From then on, one of the most famous boys' schools and one of the most famous girls' schools in Changsha were reduced to ashes. It is regrettable. I have some free time in Beijing, so I write about it here.</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of the East China University Summer Conference</h3>
<p>— Xiao Meng</p>
<p>The so-called East China University refers to the six private universities in the Jiangnan region: Nanjing, Jinling, Soochow, Zhijiang, St. John's, and Shanghai. Over the years, they have organized summer conferences. Members include prospective bachelors, YMCA staff, and Ph.D.s, masters, and families with doctorates, totaling 58 people.</p>
<p>Dates: The conference was held from July 21st to August 3rd. From the 21st to the 26th, the meeting was held at Shanghai University. Initially, Dr. Toyohiko Kagawa, a Japanese labor activist, was invited to give a speech in Putuo, but Mr. Kagawa was unable to attend, so it was held at Shanghai University instead. At the time, the enthusiasm of the listeners was truly amazing. Just seeing the demeanor of a person like Toyohiko Kagawa was enough. On the 26th, they went to Putuo for a deeper discussion and returned to Shanghai on the 3rd.</p>
<p>Travel: This trip can be said to have implemented democracy. Both male and female students, as well as teachers and doctors, all stayed in the same cabin. Those on the same boat pointed and said, "This is a group of high-level civilians." In the evening, some used canvas beds, some slept on the floor. One person even brought an iron bed frame and slept high on the deck, which can be said to be special. The next morning, the boat did not provide breakfast, so groups shared food, filling the cabin. Each took out their bread, fruit, canned goods, etc. to satisfy their hunger for a while. There were about five teams, no different from the refugees on a desert island.</p>
<p>Conference: The conference venue was in Fayu Temple, also known as the Back Temple. It is strange that a Christian conference was held in a Buddhist temple. What is even stranger is that every time the meeting was held, all the monks listened without getting tired. Some say that this is because the abbot is broad-minded.</p>
<p>Lectures: Many well-known figures led the lectures this time, such as Dr. Jiang Hongqi from the Education Bureau, Dr. Shou Yicheng from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Dr. Luo Longji from Guanghua University and his wife, Mr. Pan Shaotang, a senior student who studied in England, Professor Zheng Ruogu from Labor University, and others. Each leader patiently taught, and all the students were willing to join the discussion. Among them, Mr. Luo, the political leader, was the most popular, and the most students joined his discussion group. There was also a British-style public debate on the topic of "Should China Adopt Democracy Today?" After the debate, a certain lawyer with a doctorate said, "Everyone must understand that the word 'today' means that democracy cannot be adopted in any way before 12:00 tonight." The audience burst into laughter, because this lawyer fundamentally argued that China could not adopt democracy today. There was also a new student who had just returned from the United States. Having grown up in the United States, this was his first time back in China. He did not understand the national language and suffered a lot at the conference. Whenever there was a long lecture, he always slept to enjoy himself.</p>
<h3>Effective Proven Remedies for Summer Heatstroke</h3>
<p>— Huang Weiyan</p>
<p>My kinsman, the venerable Mr. Shi Runyuan, is in his sixties and has been a vegetarian for decades. He runs a business in Xitang, Zhejiang, and is usually in good health. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the night the other day, he suddenly had severe abdominal pain. My aunt, who is known for her virtue, saw this and immediately asked Chinese and Western doctors to find a way to treat him, but to no avail. By nine o'clock the next morning, he had cramps in both feet and became unconscious. The situation was very critical. Later, he got a method from a friend. He burned brandy in a large bowl with a basin underneath, grabbed the fire with his hand and patted the cramping area to let the heat penetrate. The cramps stopped immediately, and he was able to turn danger into safety. If there are any of the above-mentioned heatstroke symptoms during this summer and autumn season, please treat them according to this method, which is indeed very effective.</p>
<h3>Prosperous Literary Riddles at the Tongle Amusement Park</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>Since the Tongle Amusement Park staged The Flying Dragon Biography, business has been booming. However, the book stalls in the ancient and modern parks were drowned out by the gongs and drums, and few people listened. Recently, fan exhibitions, literary riddle societies, and other activities have been set up to entertain guests. The lantern riddles displayed on the first evening were all excellent. Guessers such as Shao Cigong, Dong Hanyi, and Xia Chifeng were all well-known scholars who jostled to stand in front of the stage, sometimes scratching their ears and cheeks, sometimes beaming with joy. The riddles that were guessed that evening are listed below: Dismissed from the capital, yet poor (food, two characters) - Swallow's Nest and Silver Fungus (written by Xue Ni); A red flag spreads good news, occupying the Milky Way (modern person's name) - Yin Ke; Melting coins to create images (modern person's name) - (Qian Huofo) (written by Yanzi); Sailing for the first time, scissors in the wind (modern person's name) - Zhang Chuanfan; Claiming to be the reincarnation of Lu Buwei (modern person's name) - Yu Daxiong; Descendants of Liu Ruan also farm the land (modern person's name) - Tiantaishan Nong (written by Zhegen); Illustrated Compendium of a Hundred Images (new book title) - All Living Beings; One of the Four Knows (city sign) - Heaven Knows; Striking the City God (Shanghai slang) - Tipping over the Old Man; Eating the Flesh (film title) - One Piece of Meat; Ginkgo Tree Spirit Appears (new medicine name) - Bai Guojing (written by Yun Chang). Each was given a complimentary ticket. As a result, more and more people came to guess. On Saturday night, famous scholars such as Shushisheng joined the session, creating an even more lively scene.</p>
<h3>Poor Talk</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Many literati are poor, hence Han Yu's work "Essay on Sending Away Poverty." I am also one of the poor scholars, experiencing the taste of poverty. Therefore, I have written some "Poor Talk" as follows:</p>
<p>Pawning is unavoidable for the poor. Among them, some people have the saying "To pawn and redeem is for the upper class, to pawn without redeeming is for the middle class, and to not pawn or redeem is for the lower class," as a way to make light of their situation.</p>
<p>A certain celebrity had a poem to avoid debt, saying, "Debts at the door are as chaotic as hemp, firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, tea. I can't manage them either, so I walk out the back door to see the plum blossoms." Another New Year poem says, "The east neighbor sets up a feast to see out the old year, the west house opens a banquet to celebrate the new year. Only this old man forgets the taste of meat, a plate of tofu until the Lantern Festival." This is humor in poverty.</p>
<p>Good verses about poverty from the ancients, such as "Too poor, always afraid of people guarding against thieves, long illness, all suspecting that the dog is also a fairy," and "Pitiful, most of all, the girl pulling at her clothes, crying that the neighbor's lunch smells good," are extremely poignant.</p>
<p>There is a proverb, "If you are destined to be poor, you will always be poor, picking up gold will turn into copper. If you are destined to be rich, you will always be rich, picking up paper will turn into cloth," implicitly implying that people should not seek vainly. It is truly good advice.</p>
<p>"Eating in the stomach, wearing on the body" is also a proverb. Some people reverse it, saying, "Wearing in the stomach, eating on the body," which is an even deeper level of poverty. The original clothing has long been turned into ashes, and the remaining clothes on the body are still waiting to be pawned for rice.</p>
<p>A modern saying, "No carriages or horses at the door is elegance, having qin and books is not poverty." Poor but refusing to say poor, how elegant, how broad-minded.</p>
<p>The newspaper once carried a story about a poor scholar who often pasted dozens or hundreds of layers of old newspapers to make a thick quilt. When it became dirty, he would tear off a layer. As he tore it off, it became thinner and thinner, and the seasons had already changed from winter to summer. He claimed that it was in line with the climate and hygiene and boasted of the success of his plan.</p>
<h3>What You Need to Know About Dancing (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— The Crane That Doesn't Dance</p>
<p>Mr. Kael, a Russian who is proficient in the art of dancing, was met by a reporter yesterday at the Tchachunko Garden Cafe on Avenue Joffre. They talked at length about this topic, and since there are many people learning to dance these days, I have recorded the general outline of what he said below. He said that the art of dancing has been passed down since ancient times and can express personal emotions and human thoughts. Therefore, artists often use dance postures as models for copying. In the past, the famous Greek Pythagorean Academy used dance postures to explain psychology. Music can also use dance steps to express the spirit of the music. From this, we can see the great significance of the art of dancing. Psychologists have said, "You can know a person's education by listening to their words." The same is true of dance. You can know a person's style by looking at their dance posture.</p>
<p>The art of dance can be divided into three categories: (1) folk dance and traditional dance, (2) stage dance and arena dance, and (3) social dance. Social dance is the dance used in social circles. Entertainment in human life is an extremely important thing in life. It can be used to rest the brain and cultivate temperament. Although there are many forms of entertainment, dancing is the most beautiful, just as schools have gymnastics and sports. The function of dance is very great. Not only can it create a suitable physique and a beautiful posture, but it can also please the temperament and make the movements beautiful and the spirit healthy. Therefore, those who are proficient in dancing are often physically strong, long-lived, and not easy to age, because other sports are not as natural and appropriate as dancing.</p>
<p>We often think that dancing is an easy thing, resulting in poor posture and vulgar movements, which greatly affect a person's character. Therefore, when learning for the first time, you must consult a specialist or someone who is proficient in dancing to do basic exercises. Familiar with simple steps, you will be able to master them naturally over time. Then, when you enter the social arena, you will be able to handle them easily, be welcomed, and be admired.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Shuofu of Shen Bao has been researching dance for a long time and has told me the following etiquette that should be known about dancing:</p>
<p>(1) When asking a female guest to dance, the first time it is appropriate to choose someone who is closer to you, the next time you should ask the female guests who are respected in the entire room, and then other ladies. Because asking to dance is to show respect, first asking a close female friend shows love and avoids other misunderstandings. Next, asking respected guests shows respect. Other than that, it doesn't matter, but you must pay attention. If the male guests each have their own close partners, it seems inappropriate to ask them to dance many times. You must also know that when there are fewer male guests than female guests, you must not let one or two female guests be disappointed. Most female guests want to leave the last dance to their lovers, so you should be aware of the situation and not insist on it, because most ladies use this last dance to resolve all the matters of the next appointment with their lovers. (2) It is appropriate to ask to dance after the music starts and one or two couples have already left their seats. Then, silently assess the female guests in the room and choose those who seem to want to dance but have not yet been asked by anyone. First, ask with a sincere and gentle attitude whether they are tired and whether they can dance with you. After their permission, stand up, leave your seat, walk to them, and move the chair for them (as you do when sending them back to their seat after the dance). Walk into the dance floor with them calmly and start dancing calmly and generously. Your attitude should be noble and lively, and you should avoid being coy. (3) If you must ask a certain female guest to dance, you may as well make an appointment in advance, wording it something like, "May I have the next foxtrot or Boston waltz with you?" and so on.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (251)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Who Unintentionally Sows Good Fortune and Gets a Diamond Ring, Only This Fate Has the Heart to Sing the Golden Thread</p>
<p>After a few more weeks, their fundraising tickets with paintings, calligraphy, and antiques as prizes were finally issued. Although many family treasures were unwilling to be donated as prizes, for the sake of relieving the disaster victims, everyone had to part with a little. In order to encourage people to buy tickets, they had to give people something good. Therefore, the top prize included something like a masterpiece of the Four Wangs. Fortunately, those who bought that kind of ticket were all elegant and fond of antiques. Moreover, in order to encourage ticket buyers, there were many small prizes. Those small prizes were all gifts of recent paintings and calligraphy, and some were very exquisite. Approximately one out of every five tickets had a small prize. As a result, many people bought them. Zuo Shichen also bought a dozen tickets. He did not get the big prize, but he got several small prizes. On the other hand, Shi Guanping's Shen Gao's Collection of Famous Paintings was also published volume by volume. Because he himself was proficient in Zheng Qian's three perfections, so-called poetry, calligraphy, and painting were all good, and he was also a connoisseur, the printed products were naturally extraordinary. Sometimes, he even went to the factory himself to supervise the two Japanese technicians. If he encountered a poorly printed one, he would immediately reject it. Originally, printing those collotype editions was not the same as ordinary printed products. Ordinary printed products are printed by machines, only caring about speed, like using a rotary press to print newspapers. A small book can be printed in tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of copies. The collotype edition only seeks perfection and does not seek speed. It is half-manual and seeks to be exactly like the original version. Copperplate printing cannot do this, so Shi Guanping rejected any that were slightly distorted in order to avoid damaging the true traces. Since the publication of this collection of famous paintings, not only could beginners learn from models and increase their knowledge, but those connoisseurs and collectors did not necessarily have to see his true works. At least they could get a rough idea from the collotype print. Therefore, after the publication of this collection of famous paintings, it became popular at home and abroad. All domestic artists had one copy. Later, not only was it popular domestically, but Japan, which has always admired Chinese painting, also searched for our ancient paintings for a year and bought them at high prices. They did not know how much they bought. As long as people were willing to sell, they spared no effort to collect them. Now that they saw the printed collection of Chinese famous paintings, they all came to buy them. Therefore, every collection of famous paintings was immediately reprinted in three editions. The sales were really good. Since the success of the collection of famous paintings, Shi Guanping has also printed various inscriptions on stone tablets on the calligraphy side, using good paper, good ink, and the same as the original version. All kinds of fonts are all chosen by himself. If he likes to write in that style, he chooses that one to copy. Not only are they sold in private schools, but they are also sold in schools. Therefore, their career in this bureau is also thriving.</p>

<p>Financial Gold Market Extremely Mediocre Last Week</p>
<h3>Multilateral Constraints Cause Fluctuations and Peace</h3>
<p>The gold market situation last week was very peaceful, the wind was calm and the waves were quiet, but the latent weakness had broken the eighty-two mark. From the beginning of the week to the end of the week, only twelve or thirteen taels were exchanged. Looking back, people still seem to be confused and there is no consensus in the industry. At the beginning of the week, the daily fluctuations were still eight or nine taels, but later they only fluctuated by three or four taels. However, recently, the multilateral forces have been mutually constrained and the trends have been opposed. As for the silver bars and silver prices, they were quite mediocre. The European market was stagnant, and even drafts and other advance orders have not moved for ten days. Therefore, the gold market has not changed much. The general circling situation since Wednesday was caused by the sale of Yuansheng Dai Luo et al. which once suddenly fell to seventy-two taels and two cents. On Friday, Hengxing Fuchang and other bulls pulled up sharply, and it rose sharply to eighty-four taels and nine cents. Until the weekend, it showed fatigue again. As a result, it was seventy-seven taels and a half, which was three taels and one cent lower than the previous Saturday. According to the daily exchange rate increase, it was sixty taels less. However, the current route was because the customs investigation was strict, so there was no corresponding receiving owner, and the price was five or six taels to seven or eight taels more than the period. The general situation of these five days from Tuesday, April 5th to 9th (Saturday) (August 4th, Monday, was also closed for one day due to the bank holiday) is described in detail below.</p>
<h3>Latent Weakness Drops Three Taels and One Cent</h3>
<p>On the 5th (Tuesday), there was no British silver market, but the telegraph of the previous day had already shown a decline. However, the draft did not move. The bank's internal market was firm first and then weak, which led to the initial opening of the September gold bid to rise two taels to eighty-two taels and seven cents, followed by eighty-four taels and a half. Afterwards, the selling households were active, and it was about to plummet by ten taels. In the afternoon, it was flat and closed at seventy-seven taels and one cent, which was three taels and a half lower than the previous weekend. The next day, the large silver bar returned to length, and the advance order did not change. The internal market was flat and then strong, while the gold price was soft in the morning and firm in the afternoon. The market once broke through the eighty-tael mark and closed back to seventy-nine taels, still rising about two taels. However, the total fluctuation for the day was nine taels. On Wednesday, the market situation was peaceful and there was only a fluctuation of three taels. The entry and exit of each firm were different, but the silver market and advance orders did not change. The internal market seemed tight, and the closing was seventy-nine taels and three cents. The next day, the silver market still did not change, and the draft was firm in the morning and flat later, which was contrary to the gold market. The gold bid hovered around eighty taels. From the initial flatness to strength in the morning, Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yongyuanheng, Fuchang and others pursued purchases, so in the afternoon it reached eighty-four taels and nine cents. Afterwards, each firm tended to sell, and the trend reversed sharply, breaking the eighty-tael mark, and the height was also six taels. On Saturday, the large silver bar and advance order did not shrink, and the gold market only fluctuated by three taels. In the early market, it was seventy-nine taels, and then Hengxing and others competed to buy it, and it once broke out of eighty taels. However, the seller was quick and Qin Kangrun still sold. As a result, it closed at seventy-seven taels and a half, which was three taels and one cent lower than the previous Saturday. The difference in one week was only twelve taels and seven cents, which was not the huge change of the previous week. The high and low prices of the British, American, Indian silver markets and gold bids are listed below.</p>

According to a New York telegram, the American silver price has also increased by .25, with the spot price being $.3475. British against American increased by .003125, American against British increased by .000625, both being $4.87125. The Japanese dollar decreased by .000625, totaling $49.375. British dollar remained at 2 shillings .0375. British Shanghai advance order did not change, remaining at 1 shilling and 6 pence .875. No telegram from Mumbai.</p>
<h3>The Lixi Market on Sunday is Increasingly Slack</h3>
<p>Yesterday was a bank holiday. Only a few small Chinese banks and money shops had some transactions, and the situation was very lax. The opening and closing prices were the same for both the morning and afternoon markets, at 7 mace 2 fen 9 li, and were also the same as the previous afternoon. The opening and closing prices for silver dismantling were also the same for both the morning and afternoon markets, at 2 fen. The morning market for exchange bills was 560,000 yuan, and the afternoon market was 255,000 yuan. The morning market for banknotes was 5,000 yuan, and the afternoon market was 10,000 yuan. The off-market morning market for banknotes was 82,000 yuan, and the afternoon market was 30,000 yuan. The money shops' silver public single delivery was slightly more frequent than usual, with silver public single delivery totaling more than 45 million yuan, foreign public single delivery totaling 5.89 million yuan, and remittances from all routes totaling more than 300,000 yuan. Small money shops' purchases and sales totaled more than 300,000 yuan. The Jiangnan small silver dollar was still 6 mace 4 fen 4 li in the morning market and 6 mace 4 fen 2 li in the afternoon market, with transactions totaling 3,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small silver dollar was 6 mace 1 fen 5 li and a half in the morning market and 6 mace 1 fen 5 li and seven and a half in the afternoon market, with transactions totaling 100,500 jiao in the morning market and 60,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by 1,000 again, totaling 391,000 wen.</p>
<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Rebound Significantly Last Week</h3>
<p>Customs, Reorganization, Disbandment Each Up Four to Five Yuan</p>
<p>Market Conditions Improve, Turnover Reaches Over 50 Million</p>
<p>Last week, the local bond market's futures turned bullish, and market sentiment was lively. Except for the first two days of the week, which were quiet with daily turnover of only 5 million yuan, the turnover on Wednesday and Thursday each reached 8 million yuan. The market was even better on the weekend, with daily turnover reaching 12 million yuan. The total turnover for the entire week was 50,011,500 yuan, exceeding the previous week's 26,670,000 yuan. Customs and Reorganization bonds were both buoyant, and Disbandment and Rehabilitation bonds also performed better than before. In addition, spot transactions for the entire week amounted to 87,700 yuan. The changes in bond prices were quite significant, unlike the sluggishness and lack of change in previous weeks. On Monday, market sentiment was still weak, and the trend continued to decline. However, except for the September Disbandment bonds, which fell by 1.5 yuan, there were no other major fluctuations. On Tuesday, although there was a slight recovery, only the September Disbandment bonds rebounded by 1.5 yuan, with no other changes. From Wednesday onwards, the market situation suddenly changed. Due to optimistic political situation, the Hunan affairs gradually settled, and there were some positive turns in the military situation in Shandong and Henan. Market sentiment improved, and investment purchases became smoother. The bond market phenomenon changed accordingly, and bond prices rose step by step. On Wednesday, each bond rose by 60-70 cents to 1.7-1.8 yuan. On Thursday, Reorganization and Customs bonds rose by about 1 yuan, and other bonds rose by about 50 cents. On Friday, the upward trend was the strongest. Customs and Disbandment futures jumped by more than 3 yuan, and Reorganization continued to rise by more than 2 yuan, also up about 1 yuan. On the weekend, the market was initially strong, but later, due to the eagerness of those settling accounts in the market, it began to ease. As a result, there were no major changes, and it was generally up 1 to 4-5 yuan compared to the previous week. Only the demand for 96 Financial bonds in the market was very low, and the price continued to be slightly weak. The following is a statistical table of the high and low bond prices and fluctuations (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Yarn Sales Exceptionally Enthusiastic Last Week</h3>
<p>Guangdong Merchants' Purchasing Power Strongest... Standard Nearly as High as Distant Delivery</p>
<p>The actual sales of cotton yarn were exceptionally brisk last week. Guangdong merchants were particularly eager to search the market, and all 10-count coarse yarns were purchased by them. Fortunately, the bottom stocks of 16-count and 20-count yarns were still available, and various factories were very willing to sell them according to the market trend, so the rising trend did not intensify. However, after the large-scale absorption of Japanese 20-count "Ri Chang" (立馬), "Lan Feng" (藍鳳), and "Hong Xi" (鴻禧) yarns by Guangdong merchants, there was a shortage of goods and the market became tight. Considering the development of autumn sales and the strong purchasing power of Guangdong merchants, colleagues opened up to Japanese factories. All Japanese yarn futures for January, February, and March of next year were sold out, mostly in the hands of colleagues and customers. The yarn market is currently in the autumn sales season, and this huge amount of actual sales provides a solid foundation. However, the cotton industry in various countries around the world is still in decline, and a large increase is feared to be difficult to achieve. According to statistics, various merchants bought a total of 26,225 bales throughout the week, of which one-third or two were futures. It is said that most of the purchases by Guangdong merchants were transferred to warehouses for storage and contained speculative elements. In terms of prices, 10-count native yarn rose, 16-count and 20-count yarn rose slightly, and 20-count Japanese yarn tended to rise. The buying power for standard yarn became stronger, and most people predicted that the Gengtian rice harvest would be abundant this year, and autumn sales would be prosperous. There were quite a few buyers, and each month exceeded 160 taels. On the weekend, due to the U.S. cotton government's estimates favoring short positions, 3-grade yarn plummeted by 6-7 yuan, and market sentiment softened slightly. Prices for each month fell back by 1-2 taels. As a result, the price for the near month was the same as last week, and the price for the distant month rose by about 1 tael. The total turnover for the entire week was 98,350 bales. The following is a record of the purchase amount of each merchant:</p>
<p>Merchant　Bales　Amount　Merchant　Bales　Amount　Merchant　Bales Amount</p>
<p>Guangdong　12910　Yunnan　1750　Hankou　155</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Suffers Setback Last Week</h3>
<p>Demand for Spot Cotton Extremely Weak</p>
<p>The cotton market was very weak at the beginning of the week. The weather was favorable, and the new cotton production was good. Later, there was a report of drought in U.S. cotton, but the telegraph prices were still flat. However, local sentiment was unanimously bullish, and the bulls heavily increased their positions. The Ningbo merchants were particularly strong. Rui Da, who was originally a short, covered all of his 20,000 dan short positions on Wednesday and Thursday and turned into a 20,000 dan long position. The market price was greatly shaken, breaking through the 5 tael mark. However, the sales of spot cotton were completely stagnant, and most factories absorbed enough cotton due to the low price of Indian cotton. There were few inquiries, and even Japanese factories occasionally purchased only a small number of bales. Before the report, the bulls vigorously raised prices because U.S. cotton production was within 14 million bales, and many even expected it to be around 13.5 million bales. Unexpectedly, the government estimates were beyond everyone's expectations. U.S. cotton fell by more than 60 pounds, and the Shanghai market plummeted by 60 cents. Rui Da closed out 14,000 dan of its long position on Saturday. The market price will have to follow the fluctuations of U.S. cotton. The Shanghai Exchange's standard rose first and then fell, resulting in a drop of 1-2 cents compared to the previous week. The total turnover for the entire week was 300,000 dan. Japanese merchants entered futures contracts for 23,980 dan. Yao cotton arrived at 1,520 bales, and firms entered 1,680 bales. The following is a record of the purchase amount of manufacturers and firms: Manufacturer Purchases Highest Price Lowest Price Turnover Deadline</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 36.25 ... 760 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<p>Huoji Cotton 34.75 ... 800 Bales Immediate Delivery to Packing Factory</p>
<p>Yuyao Cotton 34.40 34.20 600 Bales Spot Delivery to Warehouse</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Rebounds, British and Egyptian Cotton Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially strengthened due to good news from Liverpool, but then weakened due to Wall Street sell-offs. Finally, it rose again due to purchases by colleagues. Futures rose by 5-6 pounds, and spot rose by 5 pounds. British cotton futures fell by 1-2 points, and spot fell by 29 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 40 points. Indian cotton market closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (9th dispatch):</p>

<h3>Past and Future of the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market was slightly stable in the first half of this year due to the sharp changes in exchange rates and the lack of sources and thin inventories. However, the actual situation was still dull because Indian cotton was cheap and there was a large demand for it. Furthermore, factories, in response to social needs, changed to producing finer count yarns and adopted higher quality American cotton. The following is a list comparing the changes in cotton futures in the past six months with the same period last year:</p>
<p>First Half of This Year　Same Period Last Year</p>
<p>Highest　Lowest　Highest　Lowest</p>
<p>January　36.55　34.45　33.50　32.45</p>
<p>February　36.00　34.80　33.75　32.90</p>
<p>March　35.70　34.35　34.45　33.05</p>
<p>April　35.65　34.95　33.30　30.10</p>
<p>May　35.65　34.65　33.25　30.55</p>
<p>June　37.40　35.20　32.25　30.55</p>
<p>Half Year　37.40　35.95　35.30　30.55</p>
<p>Judging from the above table, the market price this year is higher than last year, which is purely due to the stimulation of the exchange rate market. American cotton, which dominates the world cotton market, was low last year, as was Indian cotton. Although foreign cotton fell, the combined price was still high, so it advanced and retreated in inverse proportion to foreign cotton. The following is a comparison of U.S. and Indian cotton market prices:</p>
<p>New York U.S. Cotton Spot　Mumbai Broach</p>
<p>This Year　Previous Period　Last Year　Same Period　This Year　Previous Period　Last Year　Same Period</p>
<p>Highest　Lowest　Highest　Lowest　Highest　Lowest　Highest　Lowest</p>
<p>January　17.55　16.25　20.55　19.95　309　287　363　315</p>
<p>February　16.90　14.90　20.80　19.85　282　252　363　352</p>
<p>March　16.45　14.00　21.65　20.70　270　243　382　369</p>
<p>April　16.80　15.85　20.75　19.40　272　249　369　326</p>
<p>May　16.70　16.20　19.90　18.10　265　247　353　325</p>
<p>June　16.15　13.25　19.05　18.30　248　201　348　335</p>
<p>Half Year　17.55　13.25　21.65　18.10　309　201　382　325</p>
<p>The cotton market in the past six months has been as described above. I dare not rashly predict future trends, but in my opinion, there is little optimism. Let me briefly explain. U.S. cotton's sales have decreased and inventory has increased, causing the market price to gradually fall below 13 cents. According to the government's first estimate, there are 45,815,000 acres of new cotton fields, and the number of abandoned fields is still included. If we take the average rate of abandoned fields in the past ten years, 3.6%, as a ratio, then the actual harvested area will be more than 44 million acres. Based on the average yield of 158 pounds per acre in the past ten years, the future harvest will be approximately 14 million bales. With a production of 14 million bales and the current state of the world's cotton industry being in decline, it seems that the supply and demand situation is out of balance. If the world cotton industry continues to be sluggish without any signs of recovery, and the worry of increasing inventories remains, then the predicament of the U.S. cotton market seems difficult to resolve. As for Indian cotton, the domestic revolutionary atmosphere is strong, and cotton mills work intermittently, leading to a sharp increase in inventories. Although there are reports of floods affecting the progress of the new cotton crop, most of it is still good. Without drastic changes, it seems impossible to quickly develop the market price. The situation of domestic new cotton is generally good in various provinces, except for the remote provinces of Henan and Shaanxi. If the climate is suitable, a medium harvest can be expected. According to a survey, the inventory of raw cotton in various factories in the local area at the end of the first half of the year was approximately 834,000 dan. The following is the supply and demand situation during the six months: Consumption in the First Half of the Year Inventory at the End of June</p>
<p>Chinese Cotton 123,0820 319,390</p>
<p>U.S. Cotton 510,150 177,460</p>
<p>Indian Cotton 619,500 348,730</p>
<p>Other 15,520 8,360</p>
<p>Total 2,375,990 853,940</p>
<p>Judging from the above inventory, it is enough to supply two and a half months of consumption in the second half of the year. However, the weather is hot, and the work efficiency of various factories has decreased. Moreover, due to business reasons, there are frequent reports of factories suspending work or reducing work. Therefore, this inventory supply should last for more than two and a half months. Moreover, foreign cotton has not yet arrived, and the amount is also huge. Looking at the sluggish transaction of spot cotton and the sparse transaction of new cotton in the market in recent days, we can see the general environment of the cotton market. The future trend can be roughly understood. However, changes in exchange rates and trends in the yarn market also have considerable influence (August 3rd Agricultural Report).</p>
<p>Grain: Downriver Rice Market's Falling Trend Slightly Calmed</p>
<h3>Zhabei</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the number of rice boats arriving in Shanghai at various docks was less than ten, and market sales were slightly active. Therefore, the falling trend of Northern Non-glutinous rice stabilized slightly. High-quality goods maintained their original prices, while medium and lower-quality goods were slightly weaker by half a cent because all buyers focused on high-quality Northern Non-glutinous rice, and no one inquired about goods below the middle level. The trend was stable. Although the arrival of Dongxin Non-glutinous rice was not smooth, the overall market price fell by half a yuan again, opening at only 19.5 yuan. The Thin Rice market was quiet, with only a few ships occasionally arriving at the port, but the sales were not good, and the price was still stable. The price of new top-grade rice on the Luli Road suddenly tightened, so there was no significant impact on the local market. However, according to reliable sources, several ships will arrive within a few days. The Baiyuan market was uneventful, transactions were not active.</p>
<h3>South Shanghai</h3>
<p>The number of ships arriving from downriver has decreased. Although the factories and warehouses here are eager to sell machine-milled Non-glutinous rice, there is a tendency to sell in batches. Therefore, the situation of Changbang machine-milled Non-glutinous rice has gradually stabilized. The situation of Sutong Non-glutinous rice is inconsistent because there are inquiries about high-quality goods in small quantities, while no one inquires about medium and lower-quality goods. Therefore, the overall market price fluctuates by one cent. This type of goods has been very scarce recently, and the situation is quiet. As for the association's evaluation, it has little effect during this period of weak goods. Transactions can still be made, but the source is not large, and the market is stable.</p>

<p>Rice Market</p>
<h3>South Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, only four or five ships arrived from the west road, and the trading between urban and rural areas was not good. The price of new Pudong Non-glutinous rice fell by half a yuan per day. The prices of thin rice and thick Non-glutinous rice were the same as the original price due to the scarcity of arrivals and weak demand. The old and new top-grade glutinous rice were short in supply. Merchants in rural areas were slightly purchasing rice, so the price was raised by about one cent.

<h3>New Rice from Zhoupu on the Market</h3>
<p>Harvest is Considered Bountiful</p>
<p>People's Hearts are Greatly Settled Because of This</p>
<p>New rice (named "Dong Xin") produced in the Zhoupu area of Pudong has been on the market for several days. The quantity arriving each day is only thirty or forty shi, but it is all unpolished rice, milled white by rice mills such as Xinchang and Shenli. The initial opening price was twenty-one yuan per shi, and yesterday it opened at twenty yuan. Rice shops in the northern and southern markets purchased wholesale in an endless stream, and it is sold at retail in the southern market to meet the market demand. Since the new rice from Pudong has been on the market, the rice industry in Shanghai has been sending letters one after another to inquire about the situation of the harvest, with the intention of investigating the harvest. Yesterday, the rice industry received a letter from the rice industry in Zhoupu reporting that most of the new rice in the four rural areas has been harvested this year, and the harvest is considered bountiful and the quality is good. However, the fields near the river and in low-lying areas have not yet been harvested, and it is observed that the harvest will not be reduced. This time, the typhoon did not damage the fields. Harvesting in the Minhang area will take another ten days. The rice industry received this news, and people's hearts are settled because of this. The new rice produced in areas such as Suzhou, Songjiang, Changzhou, and Wuxi (named "Xi Xin") is the largest in quantity. The harvest of their new rice is expected to be around the Double Ninth Festival, when it may be seen on the market.</p>
<p>Many are Asking to Maintain the Affairs of the China Merchants Bureau</p>
<p>Some are Asking the Acting Director-General Cai to Return to His Post Immediately</p>
<p>Some are Asking Chairman Li to Come Forward and Maintain the Critical Situation</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Union of Employees of the Head Office</h3>
<p>Supervisor Wang of the China Merchants Bureau Employees' Union Bitterly Pleads for Cai's Acting Director-General's Return to His Post. The National Government Specially Appointed the Committee for the Reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau to Exercise Its Powers, and Supervisor Wang Xunjian. The Commercial Bureau Unfortunately Suffered a Sudden Major Change, and Former Director-General Zhao Suddenly Died. All Employees of the Bureau are Deeply Saddened and Mournful. Immediately Upon Receiving Your Order, They Were Instructed to Continue to Work as Usual and Not to Abandon the Bureau's Affairs. The Day Before Yesterday, They Received an Order from Your Ministry to Forward the Chairman's Order, Especially to Continue Actively Reorganizing and Proclaiming to All Staff to Comply. We Deeply Admire Your and the Chairman's Profound Care for the Commercial Bureau and Empathy for the Employees. Everyone Was Inspired Upon Hearing the Order. However, the Recent Situation Within the Bureau Has Been Worsening Since Acting Director-General Cai Hastily Returned to Beijing. The Average Daily Expenditure, Such as Steamer Coal, Ship Berths, Salaries, and Office Expenses, is at Least Ten Thousand Taels or More. Debt Interest is Not Included. If There is a Shortage of One or Two Operations, They Will Have to be Suspended, and Affairs Will Be Difficult to Maintain. However, the Daily Income That Can Be Relied Upon is at Most Three or Four Thousand Taels, a Huge Difference, Which is Becoming Increasingly Difficult. In Addition, the Bureau Has No Officially Responsible Person, and Its External Credit is Weak. If This Situation Continues, the Salaries of the Crew Will Be Cut Off, and the Supply of Coal Will Be Cut Off, Then the Suspension of Navigation and Work Stoppage Will Be Inevitable. All Employees Have Repeatedly Thought and Unanimously Believe that at This Time of Heavy Military Transportation, in Order to Uphold Your Excellency's Purpose of Protecting Navigation, in Addition to Urgently Hoping That Acting Director-General Cai Will Return to His Post Immediately and Officially Take Office, There Should Be a Responsible Person to Maintain the Situation During This Transition Period. The Only Perfect Plan is to Appeal to Your Excellency to Order the General Management Office and the Board of Directors to Bear Joint Responsibility and Vigorously Maintain Operations and Facilitate Military Transportation Before the Government Appoints a Candidate, So That the Pressure of External Debt Can Be Eased, the Urgent Needs of Internal Daily Use Can Be Raised, Military Transportation Will Not Be Suspended, and Then the Government's Successor Can Also Calmly Find a Candidate. Moreover, in Terms of the Bureau's Finances, the New Appointee Will Hopefully Have All Parties Working Together Harmoniously to Help Support the Overall Planning, Relieve Future Difficulties, and Start a New Opportunity for Reorganization. In Short, the Government Has Its Own Authority in Hiring and Administrating Personnel, and What Dare the Employees Say? Only the Employees Are in the Bureau and Have a Deeper Sense That the Bureau's Affairs Cannot Be Without a Master for a Day, and Operations Cannot Be Interrupted for a Moment. Therefore, They Offer Their Thoughts and Contribute Their Humble Opinions. Whether They Are Appropriate or Not, We Hope That You Will Consider and Issue an Immediate Order. Respectfully, the Union of Employees of the China Merchants Bureau of the Special Municipality of Shanghai Bows Respectfully.</p>
<p>Letter to the General Management Office (Board of Directors) Requesting to Maintain the Bureau's Difficulties and Urging the Payment of Back Wages. Respectfully, Since the Unfortunate Murder of Former Director-General Zhao, We Have Read Your Office's Announcement, Your Association's Letter, the Supervisor's Telegram, and the Ministry of Transportation's Order to Forward the Chairman's Order, All of Which Instructed All Employees to Continue Working as Usual and Continue to Work Hard. Our Association Members Obeyed the Order and Strove to Maintain the Bureau's Affairs and Protect the Current State of Operations. However, Upon Quietly Observing the Recent Situation, We Gradually Felt that Hidden Dangers Were Arising. Although Acting Director-General Cai Hastily Returned to Beijing, Secretary-General Wang Was Appointed to Temporarily Represent the Bureau's Affairs to Avoid Abandoning Them, But in Reality, Difficulties Are Indeed Unavoidable. The Daily Income is Only Several Thousand, but the Expenditure Exceeds Tens of Thousands. Coal and Ship Salaries Are in Urgent Need. Any Mistake Will Hinder Operations. If Acting Director-General Cai Cannot Return to the Bureau Within Days, or Even if He Returns, There Is Still No Remedy for Funds. Then Not Only Will the Bureau's Dockworkers' Salaries Be Unsettled, and Life Will Be Alarming, but Also It Is Feared That Daily Quotations Will Be Announced and Coal Will Not Be Supplied, and Operations Will Be Suspended. The Precarious Danger Cannot Be Denied. Our Association Deeply Understands the Central Government's Sincere Concern for Navigation and Takes Into Account the Importance of Transportation. We All Believe That the Employees of the Weekend are in a Position to Advise and Save the Urgent and Maintain the Danger. The Telegrams Have Been Urging and Supervising. In Addition to One-Sidedly Telephoning the Supervisor to Urge Acting Director-General Cai to Return to the Bureau as Soon as Possible to Take Charge, We Believe That During This Transition Period, Your Office (Your Association) Should Jointly Maintain, Raise Daily Use, Preserve Operations, and Pay Off Back Wages Together with the Board of Directors and the General Management Office, So That the Difficulties Can Be Overcome and Reorganization Can Be Hoped For. We Believe That Your Office (Your Association) Must Share the Same Concerns About the Safety of This Bureau and Console the Employees' Expectations and Live Up to the Government's Past Protection of Navigation. In Addition to Separately Writing to the Board of Directors (General Management Office), We Specifically Send This Letter to You, Hoping for a Reply. Respectfully, the Union of Employees of the China Merchants Bureau of the Special Municipality of Shanghai. August 9.</p>
<h3>Appeal Telegram from the Nine Shipping Associations</h3>
<p>The Nine Shipping Associations Telegraphically Submitted to the National Government in Nanjing, Chairman Jiang of the National Government, President Tan of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Wang of the Ministry of Transportation. We Humbly Report That Since the Assassination and Death of Director-General Zhao of the China Merchants Bureau, All Affairs of the Bureau Have Become More Chaotic. Former Minister Wang of the Ministry of Transportation Appointed Cai Pei as the Acting Director-General, but It Is Said That He Has Also Resigned Now. Therefore, There is a Lack of People in Charge, and the People's Hearts Are Even More Alarmed. The Bureau's Affairs Will Inevitably Be More Disruptive. If There is No One Who is Usually Trusted to Come Forward and Maintain the Critical Situation, Then the China Merchants Bureau Will Inevitably Go Bankrupt. Needless to Say, China's Shipping Industry Has Always Relied on the China Merchants Bureau as the Only One. If It Goes Bankrupt One Day, Then China's Shipping Industry Will Be Greatly Affected. Ten Thousand of Our Colleagues Will Also Lose Their Jobs, and What Can We Imagine for the Future? The China Merchants Bureau Originally Had a Board of Directors. Now, at This Critical Moment, How Can We Let It Be Free and Carefree and Not Make Efforts to Maintain the Critical Situation? Moreover, Chairman Li Has Been in the Bureau for Many Years, and He is More Careful About the Bureau's Affairs and is Respected Both Internally and Externally. If He Can Come Forward and Maintain the Critical Situation, Then He Will Be Able to Succeed Easily and Achieve Twice the Result with Half the Effort. Our Association and Other Colleagues, For the Sake of the Country's Shipping Industry and For the Sake of Our Colleagues' Livelihoods, Dare to Telegraphically Submit to Your Majesty to Quickly Order Chairman Li to Make the Effort to Maintain the Critical Situation in Order to Emphasize the Shipping Industry and Follow Public Opinion. This is Truly a Blessing. We Humbly Present This Urgent Order and Await Your Instructions. Respectfully, the Joint Office of the Nine Shipping Associations in Shanghai, the Maritime Federation Association, the Shipping Association, the Yan Ying General Association, the Nan Jun An Association, the Bei Jun An Association, the Yan Ying General Association, the Joint Association of Drivers, the Shan Zheng Industry Association, and Others Bow Respectfully.</p>
<h3>Quezon's Mission to the United States</h3>
<p>He Passed Through Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday and Set Sail Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily Reported That Quezon, President of the Philippine Senate, is Going to the United States While Ill to Resolve the Tense Situation. Yesterday (the 9th), He Passed Through Shanghai on the Japanese Empress Ship. Due to Illness, He Stayed in the Ship at Wusongkou and Did Not Land. Quezon Left Manila on the McKinley President Ship on the 2nd of This Month and Transferred to the Japanese Empress Ship After Arriving in Hong Kong. According to His Words, He is Determined to Go to the United States This Time. He Will Not Return Home Until the Tense Situation Between the United States and the Philippines is Finally Resolved. After He Arrives in the United States, He Will Meet with President Hoover to Discuss Everything. The Current Tension Between the United States and the Philippines Has Been Unseen for Many Years. He Especially Opposes President Hoover's Appointment of Roosevelt Nicholas as the Deputy Governor of the Philippine Islands Because Roosevelt is Known for Opposing Philippine Independence, and His Measures Will Inevitably Fail to Live Up to the Expectations of the Filipino People. Quezon Was Quite Ill When He Left the Philippines This Time, So He Took His Whole Family and a Doctor With Him. However, After Being Cared for by the Sea Breeze, His Illness Has Greatly Improved. According to the Japanese Empress Ship, She Set Sail for the United States Yesterday Morning.</p>

<p>The Transportation Offices of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Sent Letters to Various Transportation Companies Yesterday, Saying, "The Case Investigates the Method of Affixing Stamp Duty to Books and Vouchers at Various Stations. It Was Notified in This Office's Notice on July 2 of This Year. Yesterday, We Received a Letter From the Finance Department of the Ministry of Railways on July 11, Saying, 'Respectfully, We Have Recently Read Your Office's Notice Regarding the Method of Affixing Stamp Duty to Books and Vouchers at Various Stations. Except for the Regulations in Items Two, Three, and Four, There is Nothing Inappropriate. Item Five, the Freight Bill, is Only a Voucher for Picking Up Goods and is Not a Receipt for Money. Item Six, the Package Ticket, Belongs to Cargo Transportation According to the Case and is Not Within the Scope of the Regulations. Neither the Railway Bureau Nor the Merchants Need to Affix It. We Should Correspond and Ask You to Check and Correct It and Hope to Order It to Be Notified Accordingly.' In Addition, We Received a Letter on July 26, Briefly Saying, 'Approved by the Office's Vehicle Character No. 1388, Regarding Whether or Not Items of Freight Bills and Package Tickets Should Be Notified and Deleted, the Ministry Will Discuss With the Tax Bureau for Approval Before Another Method Will Be Implemented, Etc.' The Case Involving Whether or Not Stamp Duty Should Be Affixed to Items of Freight Bills and Package Tickets Has Been Approved by This Ministry and Approved by the Ministry of Finance to Temporarily Exempt It From Affixing. It Was Ordered in the Order of the Ministry of Finance No. 3829 on March 28 of This Year. Various Kinds of Books and Vouchers, Whether They Were Previously Affixed With Stamp Duty or Not, That Are Not Within the Scope of These Regulations Should Be Allowed to Stop Completely. In Addition to Informing the Ministry of Finance to Order Various Stamp Tax Bureaus to Comply With the Order, It Is a Special Joint Order to Comply With the Case. The Affixing of Stamp Duty to the Two Items of Issuing Bills and Package Tickets Should Be Immediately Handled by Your Office to Issue a Notice for Deletion Without the Need to Discuss With the Tax Bureau for Approval. The Previous Letter Was Sent in Response, Hoping That You Will Check and Order It to Be Notified Accordingly, Etc.

<h3>Initiating the Organization of a Flat-Price Rent Promotion Association</h3>
<p>The Inaugural Meeting Was Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Thirty-One Members of the Preparatory Committee Were Elected</p>
<p>Citizens Zhang Yichen, Yu Hualong, Etc. of This City Initiated the Organization of a Rent Dispute Mediation Committee. Details Have Been Recorded in Yesterday's Newspaper. It is Now Known That the Association Held an Inaugural Meeting in the Auditorium of the Shuji Elementary School Near the Tianhou Palace Bridge Yesterday. More Than 150 Representatives of Various Groups Attended. Hu Shouqi, Yu Hualong, and Gu Wensheng Were Publicly Elected as the Presidium. After Performing the Ritual, the Chairman Reported the Purpose of the Meeting. Then, Representative Jin Chuxiang, Etc. Gave Speeches, and the Discussion Began Immediately.

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks for Exemption From Pen and Ink Tax</h3>
<p>Document Submitted to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submitted a Document to the Ministry of Finance, Saying, "The Pen and Ink Trade Association Continues to Ask for Pen and Ink to Be Exempt From Tax. We Respectfully Submit the Circumstances and Ask for Your Review and Approval. The Case Investigates the Previous Request From the Shangzheng Association to Exempt Pen and Ink From Tax. On July 1, We Received a Reply From Your Ministry, Which Said That the Pen and Ink Paper Is Not Only Limited to Education and Documents, Which is Different From Purely Educational Supplies. Now That Various Kinds of Paper Are Subject to Customs Duty, Pen and Ink Are Treated the Same Way, So It Is Not Appropriate to Exempt Them Alone. However, It Is Said That Each Hundred Jin of Huizhou Ink Only Sells for Forty-Four Taels of Silver. If This is True, Then the Current Export Tariff of Imposing Four Taels of Customs Silver Per Hundred Jin Is Too Heavy. In Addition to Copying and Sending It to the National Tariff Commission When Revising the Export Tariff in the Future to Investigate and Revise It to Achieve Proper Compliance, It Is Appropriate to Notify You. After the Association Received It, the Association Sent a Letter to Forward It. Now, on the 7th of This Month, We Received Another Letter From the Pen and Ink Trade Association, Which Said That We Humbly Read the Ministry of Finance's Reply That Pen and Ink Paper Is Not Only Limited to Education and Documents, Which is Different From Purely Educational Supplies. We Thought That Although Schools Also Lecture on Western Learning, They Never Fail to Learn Chinese First. Since We Learn Chinese First, All Citizens' Reading and Writing Must Grasp a Pen to Research. Then, Pen and Ink's Assistance to Education is Parallel and Not Contrary. Moreover, the Government Advocates Education Without Leaving Any Efforts. Books Are Exempt From Their Customs Duties, and All It Wants is for Books to Circulate Throughout the Country. The Depository of Books Is in Writing, and the Silent Writing of Words Is in Pen and Ink. Now That We Advocate Domestic Goods, Pen and Ink Are Naturally in the Example of Advocating. The Association Thought Again and Again That the Raw Materials of Books Are in Paper. If Paper Is Not Made Into Books, Then It Will Be Subject to Half the Tax, and If It Is Made Into Books, Then It Will Be Completely Exempt From Tax. And the Raw Materials Required for Pen and Ink (Such As Wool, Bamboo Sticks, Yellow Wolf, Rabbit Skin, Printing Materials, Smoke Gum Tablets, and Musk) Are Collected From Remote Provinces and Foreign Countries. In the Mainland, They Pay Local Tax Levies, and at Customs, They Pay Import Taxes. Before and After, It Has Exceeded 20%. However, the Book Tax Is Only on Its Raw Materials and Does Not Tax the Books. Pen and Ink's Assistance to Books for Education Is Proposed to Be Similar to the Request for Documents. It Seems That There is Nothing Inappropriate. Moreover, the Material Taxes Have Been Repeated to the Extreme. That Is to Say, the Statistics of Pen and Ink Sales Are Only 500,000 Yuan Per Year. If We Calculate 10% of the Annual Sales Amount for Tax, It Will Be as Much as 50,000 Yuan. If We Calculate With Customs Silver, It Will Probably Be Only 30,000 Taels. The Request to Refer to the Example of Documents to Exempt Tax Is Only Like Reducing a Grain of Rice in a Warehouse. It Seems That It Does Not Hinder the Public's Financial Support. We Should Report the Circumstances and Ask the Ministry of Finance to Approve the Exemption From Tax According to the Example to Relieve Merchants' Difficulties and Benefit the Students, Etc.' After the Association Received the Pen and Ink, Although It is a Semi-Educational Supply, According to Its Nature, It Seems That It is Also Different From the Paper That is Only a Raw Material for Educational Supplies. Since Imported Goods Have Been Imported, the Effect of Domestically Produced Pen and Ink Has Gradually Decreased, and Sales Have Shrink. With Products of 50 Million Yuan, the Workers Who Rely on It for Their Livelihoods Still Reach More Than 3,000 People, and the Relationship is Not Insignificant. Even If We Only Talk About Supporting Domestic Goods and Maintaining Manual Livelihoods, the Tax Exemption Situation Is Similar to That of Artificial Hand-Woven Native Cloth. Moreover, According to the Production Amount for Tax Calculation, the Public Tax Revenue Donated by Tax Exemption is Minimal, Which Does Not Hinder Financial Support. Since the Association Has Sent a Letter to Ask, It is Inconvenient to Block It From Above. We Should Prepare a Document Again to Ask Your Ministry to Review and Approve It According to the Example to Help Maintain It. We Are So Grateful. Sincerely."</p>
<p>Report on the French-Funded Water and Electricity Strike Yesterday</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting</h3>

<h3>Organization of the Committee</h3>
<p>Representatives of Twenty-One Trade Unions Organized a Committee That Has Scheduled a Meeting and Issued a Notice as Follows: "Respectfully, At the General Assembly of Representatives of Various Trade Unions in the City on the 6th of This Month to Discuss Assistance to the French-Funded Water and Electricity Strike, the 'Shanghai Labor Community 721 Massacre Support Association' Was Established at That Time to Deal With Imperialism and Awaken Sympathy From All Walks of Life to Reasonably Fight for the Protection of National Rights and People's Lives. Twenty-One Trade Union Representatives Were Elected on the Spot to Organize the Committee. You Were Also Elected as One of Them. It Is Now Scheduled to Convene the First Meeting at 2:00 PM on the 12th of This Month (That Is, Tuesday) to Discuss the Allocation of Duties. At That Time, We Hope That You Will Come and Express Your High Views and Discuss the Progress Together. Thank You."</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Congress of Representatives</h3>
<p>The Congress of Representatives of Various Trade Unions to Assist the French-Funded Water and Electricity Workers Now Issues the Following Declaration: "French-Funded Water and Electricity Workers Made Demands to Capitalists Due to the Oppression of Life. These Were Originally Ordinary Events. Unexpectedly, the French Imperialist Capitalists Were Violent and Willful. First, They Refused Mediation and Regarded Our Country's Government Offices as Nothing. Then, They Hired White Russian and New Workers to Persist in Their Goal of Destroying the Workers. Finally, They Showed Their Teeth and Claws, Arrested the Workers, and Eventually Evolved Into the Massacre of Workers on July 21. The Means Are Getting More and More Brutal, and the Plans Are Getting More and More Ruthless. The So-Called Conditions Show No Sincerity and Are Deliberately Delayed Day After Day. Since This Is the Case, It Is Impossible to Conceal Anything. Our China Has Not Yet Reached the Time of Extinction. The Concessions Are Just a Kind of Leased Land. They Have Been So Cruel and Poisonous in Dealing With Us Chinese. If We Do Not All Rise Up to Make a Strong Representation to the French Imperialists, I am Afraid That the Failure of the French-Funded Water and Electricity Workers Will Be Enough to Promote Our National Subjugation. Everyone Should Know That This Incident of the French-Funded Water and Electricity Workers Occurred Entirely Because the French Imperialists Despised Our Nation, Which Caused It. In Other Words, the Problem of French-Funded Water and Electricity Workers Is Not a Local Problem. It Can Be Said That It Is the Entire Problem of Our Chinese Nation. A Small Number of French-Funded Water and Electricity Workers Can Be Their Sacrificial Lambs. Why Can't the Compatriots of the Whole Country Be the Sacrificial Lambs of the French Imperialists? We Are Now Helping the French-Funded Water and Electricity Workers to Seek Survival for the Entire Nation and Also to Avenge the Humiliation of the Whole Nation. If the French-Funded Water and Electricity Workers Do Not Achieve Their Final Goal, Our Responsibility Cannot Be Discharged for a Day. Our Responsibilities Are (1) to Seriously Warn the French Imperialists and Urge Them to Wake Up as Soon as Possible. (2) To Use Economic Power to Help the French-Funded Water and Electricity Workers Fight to the End Without Yielding. (3) To Awaken the Compatriots of the Whole Country to Take a Unified Stance and Launch a General Attack Order Against the French Imperialists to Make Them Afraid to Despise Our Nation. We Hereby Declare and Pray for Your Public Appraisal." The Congress of Representatives of Various Trade Unions in Shanghai to Assist the French-Funded Water and Electricity Workers Declaration.</p>
<h3>Donations Are Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>In Addition to the Solicitation by the South Goods Industry Workers' Union, the Support Association's Fundraising Has Been Ongoing for Days.

<h3>Legal French Water and Electricity Workers' Warning to Senior Management</h3>
<p>The French Water and Electricity Workers' Union yesterday planned to issue a written warning to senior manager Monsieur, as previously reported. We understand that the union's warning letter has been drafted and was sent out yesterday afternoon. We have obtained the original text, which is as follows: Warning Regarding: It is known that this time, the workers of our union, due to unbearable pressure on their livelihoods, had no choice but to propose demands. These demands were peaceful and moderate, and none exceeded normal limits. Your Senior Management, however, issued three notices, sternly rejecting them, which inevitably led to a strike and disappointed the workers. This is the first point for which we must issue a warning. Before the strike occurred and after it had already started, our government authorities convened mediations twice. Your Senior Management disregarded these, and your stubborn attitude is already appalling. This is the second point for which we must issue a warning. Furthermore, on July 8th and 11th, our union workers accepted Mr. Du Yuesheng's mediation within a possible range and immediately returned to work. However, Your Senior Management suddenly changed its mind, reneging on its previous commitment. First, it closed the iron gates to prevent entry, and then it refused to have the new workers withdraw. This resulted in the failure of our workers' return to work. This shows that Your Senior Management lacks sincerity in negotiations, allowing the strike to gradually escalate and the situation to become tense, leading to the tragic incident of July 21st. This is the third point for which we must issue a warning. Recently, the central government has shown concern for the labor movement and has separately engaged Mr. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, and the City Party Headquarters to make every effort to mediate so that the strike can be resolved in a good way. However, the various conditions accepted by Your Senior Management not only failed to provide the workers with satisfaction and had many defects, but also created additional problems beyond the original subject of the conditions, wanting to dismiss a large number of workers (reduced from 150 to 40). This kind of additional problem is not only ridiculous but also absurd. Not only is it difficult for our union workers to accept, but all 800,000 workers in the city will also deny that Your Senior Management is deliberately prolonging the strike, with a dangerous and unreasonable intention. This is the fourth point for which we must issue a warning. In summary, regarding these four points, Your Senior Management cannot evade its responsibility for this strike and must bear a major responsibility. Our union hopes that Your Senior Management will realize this as soon as possible and prevent the strike from escalating and prolonging, leading to further unexpected events. We have no choice but to issue a serious warning to Your Senior Management.</p>
<h3>Relief for the Cotton Textile Industry</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government, based on a report from the Social Affairs Bureau, forwarded to:</p>
<p>The State Council for investigation and action, as ordered by the National Government</p>
<p>The National Government issued an instruction to the Executive Yuan on the 7th, regarding the Shanghai Mercerized Cotton Textile Industry Association's request for the allocation of subsidies for relief: "Instruct the handling of this matter. The Shanghai Municipal Government reported that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce stated that the Shanghai Mercerized Cotton Textile Industry Association wrote, 'Our industry peers all believe that the cotton textile industry is declining day by day and is difficult to maintain. Since last winter, nearly half of the factories have closed down, and the remaining factories are mostly precarious. We have formulated six proposed solutions: (1) Revise labor-management conditions in the shortest possible time. (2) Reduce and exempt harsh taxes and levies. (3) Request the National Goods Bank and the Municipal Bank to provide interest-free loans. (4) Request the government to allocate subsidies. (5) Request the government to order all government agencies to use domestic goods. (6) Request Zhejiang Province to abolish harsh taxes on yarn and cloth. All have been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for separate relief. Except for the third proposal, which has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to be handled by the National Goods Bank, and the fifth proposal, which has already been addressed by the Municipal Government, we implore your association to forward the remaining proposals separately.' It was found that the industry's request for relief, except for the third item regarding the exemption of heavy levies by the Zhejiang Provincial Tax Bureau, which was expedited due to the time limit, has already been telegraphed by our association directly to the Ministry of Finance and Zhejiang Province. There are still the first item, which is under the jurisdiction of your bureau, and the fourth item, which should be submitted by the bureau to the Municipal Government and then to the National Government. Therefore, this bureau has submitted a plan to the cotton textile industry for relief to your government, which has been forwarded to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult separately with the Ministry of Finance to reduce taxes and order the National Goods Bank to discuss and implement various proposals. Now, according to the association's report, the cotton textile industry's proposed relief plan still has the first and fourth items, requesting your approval. Regarding the fourth item, requesting the government to allocate subsidies, citing the precedent of the National Government's relief for the shipping industry by allocating public bonds, we request the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to allocate 2 million yuan of reorganization or demobilization bonds to be distributed by the Cotton Textile Industry Association according to the amount of inventory in each factory for relief. This matter concerns the national treasury and should be submitted with a document to your director for review and forwarding for approval and implementation. Therefore, this city's mercerized cotton textile industry is indeed declining day by day and is difficult to maintain, which is a real situation. The request for the allocation of subsidies for relief concerns the national treasury. In addition to instructing the waiting for submission for review and approval, it is appropriate to report the situation and request your prompt instruction to comply, which is for public convenience. Therefore, in addition to instructing knowledge of the notification to be handled by the Executive Yuan, it is hereby ordered that the Yuan examine and handle this matter, which is hereby ordered."</p>
<h3>Suggestions on the Scope of Rejecting Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>Proposed by Xu Chunrong</p>
<p>Consisting of Eleven Categories</p>
<p>Quarterly member Xu Chunrong of the China National Goods Maintenance Association, in view of the crisis of gold being expensive and silver being cheap, with China facing the risk of bankruptcy, believes that the fundamental solution lies in unifying and reforming the currency system and promoting local industry. The immediate solution should be a nationwide rejection of foreign goods to reduce leakage and maintain the lifeblood of the nation. Therefore, he specifically proposed to the association a scope of rejecting foreign goods, consisting of eleven categories, all of which have Chinese substitutes, and requested that it be forwarded to the Party and government authorities for adoption and supervision of public groups to implement. The original text of his proposal is recorded as follows: "Regarding the proposal, this association was established more than twenty years ago as a pioneering group in promoting national goods. From the beginning of our comrades' union, we deeply knew that the result of the free sale of foreign goods is that money flows abroad, and the people's livelihood is cut off in society. The country has no way to stand, and the people have no way to live. Unfortunately, in the past twenty years, the free sale of foreign goods is like a dyke collapsing, which cannot be resisted. The people's livelihood is declining like a river, going down a thousand miles. Although the voice of promoting national goods continues to appear in metropolitan centers, few respond to the high-sounding tune. Or some take promoting and improving national goods, developing overseas trade, and resisting imports as a prerequisite, which is indeed a fundamental talk. Evidenced by the current situation in our country, the knowledge of the technical community is backward, the financial power has been manipulated by foreigners, the shipping power has also been controlled by foreigners, and the knowledge of merchants in international trade is naive. Moreover, the policies of various countries to protect their own domestic industry and commerce are becoming more and more sophisticated. It is easy to talk about seeking a place in the commercial war by competing with them with our backward cause, that is, chasing a hundred steps with one step. It is necessary to know that gold is expensive and silver is cheap. Our China, which uses silver, should take the increase in the cost of foreign goods and the decrease in the cost of exports of national goods as a good opportunity for China to revitalize its industry. However, the failure of national goods to sell as usual and the decline of the export business are even worse than before. Although the import of foreign goods has temporarily shown a slight pause, the report stated that Japan's goods shipped to China in the past month have returned to their original position. One country is like this, and other countries can be known. The so-called new national goods in China all draw materials from foreign raw materials, so the cost of national goods cannot escape the value of the source of foreign goods. The Chinese people's use of foreign goods has become an unbreakable habit. If it is not foreign goods, it seems that it is not suitable for the needs of life. The so-called promotion of national goods has become an impossible environment to realize its goals. Today's flooding of foreign goods in China is like a collapsed dyke. If the breach is not urgently blocked, there will be nothing left for the fish. The method of blocking the breach is to choose the most needed, most popular foreign goods, and the original Chinese goods can be used instead, refusing to use them regardless of their invasive nature. Hold on to the purpose of foreign goods and make compatriots across the country refuse to use them. Then the violent leakage can be blocked immediately, and the operation of national goods can be developed immediately. There is no failure to obtain the final success. Think about the industrial and commercial policies of various countries, promoting them abroad by invading, and blocking them at home. The Chinese industrial and commercial policies are promoted abroad. Customs cannot exempt export taxes, and merchants have no long-term vision and ability. That is, there is no way to promote foreign goods. Foreign goods are imported into China. Customs cannot protect taxes by force, and the people are addicted to foreign goods. This is a way to resist the import of foreign goods. Even with foreign goods and textiles, the Chinese population is 500 million. Each person buys 2 yuan of foreign textiles every year, then the money flowing out of the country should be 100 million. Only this kind of leakage is enough to be shocking. There are still endless consumption of foreign goods. The great leakage can be known. If we Chinese people can work diligently in this regard, in a blink of an eye, imports will definitely turn into exports. What is the benefit to the country? Now, taking it as a self-determination method to awaken the people to uniformly refuse to use foreign goods, this high-minded and reasonable work will definitely have a quick effect. Now, the major foreign goods that can be rejected and used with original substitutes are listed as follows: 1. Foreign goods' textiles 2. Foreign goods' cotton yarn 3. Foreign goods' rayon 4. Foreign goods' cigarettes and foreign wines 5. Foreign goods' kerosene 6. Foreign goods' soap 7. Foreign goods' aquatic products 8. Foreign goods' sugar 9. Foreign goods' cosmetics 10. Foreign goods' porcelain 11. Foreign goods' coal The above eleven items are the scope of propaganda to reject foreign goods. Products manufactured by foreign businessmen in factories established in China are regarded as foreign goods and rejected as an example. The propaganda method to reject them should be determined that this association is the China National Goods Maintenance Association, which unifies the power and actively proceeds to report to the Central Party Department for approval and dispatch personnel to guide, and report to the Central Party Department to order party departments at all levels across the country to cooperate with local agencies to guide the agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic groups to organize Chinese national goods maintenance sub-associations within seven days after the document arrives and widely promote. Each week, there will be at least two publicity events. Regardless of the poor villages, there must be lectures on the advantages and disadvantages of promoting national goods and rejecting foreign goods wherever there are people. Each month, there will be at least one door-to-door promotion. Party and government personnel bear the heavy responsibility of leadership, and they must set an example. Party departments at all levels are responsible by standing committee members to supervise the staff and party members under their jurisdiction. After receiving three publicity events, they are not allowed to use the above-mentioned foreign goods again. If violations are found or supervision is weak or condoning offenses, the supervisory committee will discuss the punishment. Government agencies are responsible by the chief officer to supervise the various agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic groups under their jurisdiction. The standing committee members are responsible for supervising the schools under their jurisdiction. The principals of the schools are responsible for supervising them. The managers of companies, businesses, and factories are responsible for supervising them. If violations are found or supervision is weak or condoning offenses, the local party department will investigate and discuss the punishment. If supervision is effective and actual results are found, the local party department or public group will provide proof and submit it to the central government for generous rewards to encourage and punish. As for the fundamental method of promoting national goods, this association will properly draft opinions and submit them for implementation. Is it feasible? I respectfully ask for a public decision. This is to the China National Goods Maintenance Association, proposer Xu Chunrong."</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Rayon Special Tax Bureau Solicits Donations for 19th Year Cigarette Treasury Bonds</h3>
<p>Reply from the Mercerized Cotton Textile Industry Association</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Rayon Special Tax Bureau, because the Jiangsu Finance Commissioner recently assigned the bureau to solicit 15,000 yuan of 19th-year cigarette treasury bonds, specifically sent a letter to the Mercerized Cotton Textile Industry Association, requesting it to widely solicit donations from various cotton textile factories. The Mercerized Cotton Textile Industry Association, feeling that the industry has been oppressed by foreign goods in recent years and the internal affairs are unstable, is unable to solicit donations. Therefore, it has replied to the bureau, expressing its inability to fulfill the mission. The exchange of letters between the two parties is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Letter to the Mercerized Cotton Textile Industry Association</h3>
<p>I am writing to inform you that we have received an order from the Jiangsu Finance Commissioner to solicit 15,000 yuan of 19th-year cigarette treasury bonds. The enemy's military pay is urgently needed and must be delivered as quickly as possible. However, the solicitation of bonds depends on the assistance of others, so it is hoped that we can raise the funds as soon as possible. Currently, in addition to the bureau finding ways to advance a portion of the funds, the remaining amount is still large. Your association is the leader of the cotton textile factory industry and is usually closer to various machine factories. There are many people in the factory who understand the righteousness and are enthusiastic about patriotism. It is hoped that your association will widely publicize the benefits of this issuance of treasury bonds, which uses the unified cigarette tax as the foundation, pays interest on time, can be repaid in 36 months, has high interest, a short period, and stable guarantees. Please persuade and assist in the success of the cause.</p>
<h3>Reply to the Jiangsu Provincial Rayon Special Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>I am writing to inform you that we have received your letter of August 8th regarding the solicitation of 19th-year cigarette treasury bonds. Our association's patriotic enthusiasm is not lagging behind, and we should do our best to broadly persuade in the face of righteousness. However, it is found that our industry peers have been oppressed by foreign goods and the internal affairs have been unstable since last year, and they have reached a dead end. Although we have repeatedly submitted requests to the government for relief, we have been waiting in vain. We are afraid that we will be unable to fulfill the mission. Therefore, we have sent a special letter in reply.</p>

<h3>Is It A Ghost Claiming A Life?</h3>
<p>Neither Scriptures Nor Money Is Wanted</p>
<p>A Xiao's Deep Affection After Death</p>
<p>Rong Ling Indeed Died On Time</p>
<p>Nothing Is Too Strange In This World</p>
<p>The Suzhou woman You Xue, residing at No. 3 Jinfu Lane, Vegetable Market Street, French Concession, used to work as a helper in a Shanghai brothel. Now she has opened her own brothel and accumulated a lot of ill-gotten gains. She has a daughter named Rong Ling. Since childhood, she has been betrothed to A Xiao, the son of a farmer surnamed Lu from the same hometown. She was brought to the Lu family as a child bride at the age of seven. This year, she is already sixteen years old. Seeing that Rong Ling is reaching the age of sixteen and is quite beautiful, she is just right to be a money-making tree. So, she took the excuse of wanting to take her daughter and son-in-law to Shanghai to study, which Qianzhai refused. She then proposed to break off the engagement and was willing to return the betrothal gifts and the expenses of marrying another wife, amounting to hundreds of silver dollars. Otherwise, she would take legal action in the official court. The Lu family relies on farming to support themselves and are intimidated by her financial power and dare not compete with her. So, the young couple divorced. The You Xue then took Rong Ling to Shanghai and lived in a small house in Jinfu Lane. She hired a teacher to teach her singing and dancing, preparing to hang up a sign and solicit customers in a year. However, Rong Ling's fiancé, A Xiao, although a farmer's son, had been close to Rong Ling since childhood. After the divorce was agreed upon last March and they were separated, A Xiao became ill due to anger and lay in bed for more than two months before dying. At the end of last month, Rong Ling suddenly suffered from typhoid fever, which came on fiercely. She sought medical treatment without any effect. So, she sought divine intervention and divination, and everyone said that her fiancé had found her. The You Xue then hired monks and Taoists to chant scriptures and burn paper money to help him pass into the afterlife. But Rong Ling's fiancé suddenly possessed Rong Ling's body the day before yesterday and said, "I don't want scriptures or money. I just want Rong Ling. I will come to take her tomorrow morning at 5 o'clock." After saying this, Rong Ling fell into a coma. She died at 5 o'clock yesterday morning. Her mother was in great grief. In the afternoon, she prepared a coffin and collected her remains.</p>
<h3>Detective's Illegal Acts Reach the Extreme</h3>
<p>Illegal Beating During Detention of a Thief</p>
<p>False Accusations of Upright Citizens to Defraud Money</p>
<p>A Jiangbei man named Ji Zhongtang, working as a detective in the fifth district, arrested a thief named Wang Jiaxin and subjected him to torture. He then ordered Wang to falsely accuse Zhang Fengxiang of defrauding him of twenty dollars. He also falsely accused Pan Fa Ji Silk Factory on Da Tong Road of buying stolen goods, intending to extort money. The Public Security Bureau discovered this, rebuked and dismissed him, and transferred him to the local court for investigation. He has now been publicly prosecuted for crimes of false accusation, fraud, dereliction of duty, and assault. Yesterday, Judge Qian opened the court for trial. The victim, Zhang Chenshi, testified that Ji Zhongtang arrested her husband, Zhang Fengxiang, and took him to the Third Sub-station of the Fifth District, and later to the Fifth District Headquarters. Ji Zhongtang told them that paying one hundred dollars would resolve the matter. After pleading, the amount was reduced to thirty-five dollars. Twenty dollars was paid, with fifteen dollars still owed, and the money was handed over to another detective. Furthermore, the victim, Pan Chenshi, testified that she runs the Pan Fa Ji Silk Factory at No. 45 and 46 Chongyu Lane on Da Tong Road, and her husband's name is Pan Qifa. Ji Zhongtang first came to her factory with a pair of handcuffs, saying that thieves had been there and demanded money to settle the matter, but they ignored him. The second time, he brought a thief to falsely accuse them. At this point, Ji Zhongtang testified that he went with detectives Chen Keqing, Xu Haishan, and patrol officers from the fourth district only once and did not ask for money beforehand. When asked what the patrol officers were called, he replied that he did not know. As for the twenty dollars from Zhang Chenshi, he did not ask her for it and did not speak to her. Then, Wang Jiaxin testified that Ji Zhongtang arrested and beat him. The method of beating involved using ropes on rings, like tightening a boat awning, suspending him high up and beating him. He was also laid on his back on a bench and pepper water was poured into his nose, forcing him to implicate Zhang Fengxiang. However, he did not steal anything. He was asked by Yang Xiao Wuzi to sell two bolts of old cloth for a total of six dollars. Yang Xiao Wuzi works on the Blue Funnel Line steamer, and his background is currently unknown. The questioning officer then questioned Ji Zhongtang, who claimed he was falsely accused, and that everything could be verified by their foreman, Xin Jingsheng, and that such things never happened. The judge then stated that his actions were clear and ordered Xin Jingsheng to be summoned to court for questioning. He then ordered the defendant to be detained and the trial adjourned to another date.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Collects Autumn Property Tax</h3>

<h3>Wooden Vessel Aground Outside Wusong Mouth</h3>
<p>Ship and Cargo Loss Estimated at Over 20,000 Gold Dollars</p>
<p>The large fishing boat Jin Heli, loaded with a large quantity of timber from Fujian, was en route to the Yangtze River for sale. Around 3 PM the day before yesterday, while passing through the Niuhonggang sea area outside Wusong Mouth, the vessel suddenly ran aground on a sandbar. The hull was damaged, and water filled the hold. The timber drifted and scattered, swept away by the wind. The loss of ship and cargo is estimated at over 20,000 gold dollars. After the incident, the shipowner immediately sent a letter to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to ask the Wusong maritime and land authorities to investigate. If any nearby vessels recover any of the timber, the shipowner will give separate rewards for its return in order to recoup the principal.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Introduces Domestic Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter in reply to the Association of Practitioners of Footwear, stating, "With regard to your letter of the 6th of this month, requesting a detailed reply on whether domestic factories produce woolen fabrics or serge, etc., we have investigated and found that the Kaiyuan Woolen Factory, located outside Xuanwumen in Beijing's Lanman Hutong, produces woolen fabrics, woolen yarn, carpets, and other items. We previously wrote to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to introduce local shops to promote their sales. The Chamber then introduced Yong'an, Xinxin, Lihua, Huaxin, Qihua, and the Zhonghua Department Store, etc., six companies in total, and replied to the factory on June 30th, requesting them to send samples to our showroom for display. They replied that the samples were being prepared and would be sent soon, and we would notify you when they arrive. As for factories producing serge, there is the Tianjin Tonghui National Goods Weaving Factory. This factory weaves various colors of serge, and the quality is excellent, comparable to imported products. The factory now has a distribution office at Yiji on Avenue Messimy in the French Concession. The director of the distribution office is Mr. Li Jingshe. You may contact him for business."</p>
<h3>Yangjing Town, Pudong Requests Flat-Price Rice Sales</h3>
<p>The Tu Dong (local representatives) of Yangjing Town, Pudong, Cheng Fuqing, Huang Zhihui, and others, jointly submitted a document to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating, "Regarding the soaring rice prices, we request flat-price rice sales as an example, to benefit the people and maintain their livelihood. The issue of food is closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Our area of Pudong has always been unable to meet the demand for rice and grain. Furthermore, due to consecutive years of poor harvests and the impact of soaring rice prices, the people's livelihood is in dire straits. The authorities have long been aware of this. Flat-price associations have been established along the Pudong area to sell rice at flat prices, but Yangjing is still lacking such arrangements. The Tu Dong, etc., cannot remain indifferent as if they were Qin people viewing the Yue. Therefore, we jointly submit this request to the authorities, requesting a prompt order for the Flat-Price Committee to come to the town for flat-price sales. We, the Tu Dong, will follow closely to assist, in order to support the authorities' benevolent policy of nourishing the people." After receiving the submission, the Bureau approved it yesterday.</p>

Yesterday, the captains sent letters to the major businesses and managers within their defense areas, urging partners to enthusiastically join to benefit and protect the local area.</p>
<h3>Judgment of the Case of Mutual Accusations Between Hu Huilin and His Wife</h3>
<p>Jockey Hu Huilin, when young, was married by his parents to Ms. Wenxian, the sister of Yong business Fang Jiaobai. They have been married for sixteen years and have seven children together, demonstrating their mutual affection. However, in the winter of the sixteenth year (of the Republic), the magician Lang Deshan brought his daughter Mina to Shanghai to perform. Hu was seduced by her beauty and began to resent his wife. Initially, they merely shared the same bed but had different dreams, then they drifted apart, and eventually they ended up in court. Hu claimed that Ms. Fang had taken medicine to induce an abortion and requested a divorce. Fang denied all of the plaintiff's claims and countersued, accusing Hu of abandonment and requesting that Hu pay her property worth 60,000 gold dollars for her living expenses and the education of their children. After repeated hearings, Hu, although far away overseas and represented by a lawyer, was ultimately ruled by Judge Yang that both parties' claims were without merit and were dismissed. Each party was to bear their own litigation costs. The reasoning of the judgment is recorded below: The plaintiff requests a divorce on the grounds that there is no affection between the two parties and that the defendant took medicine to induce an abortion. Marital discord is not comparable to a breakdown of affection. The plaintiff and defendant have lived together for more than ten years and have six or seven children. If there were no affection between them, how could they have stayed together until now? Therefore, his claim is clearly untrue. Regarding the claim that the defendant took medicine to induce an abortion, whether or not it happened, it is not sufficient reason to immediately request a divorce. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had an affair and intended to divorce and remarry, which is not without cause. Regarding the defendant's countersuit for alimony, the plaintiff left 2,000 dollars for household expenses when he went abroad to do business, and the defendant also took 3,500 dollars, which cannot be considered abandonment. As for his threatening to not return to the country, it was a moment of overreaction and cannot be used as evidence. Furthermore, temporary discord between husband and wife does not necessarily mean that they cannot reconcile. In order to maintain family harmony, the defendant should not demand 60,000 dollars in alimony simply because the plaintiff requested a divorce. Based on the above arguments, in accordance with Article 98 of the Civil Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>
<h3>Woman Freed from Illegal Confinement in Shackles, Case Transferred to Court</h3>
<p>Zhang Xushi (also known as Xu Xiuling), the wife of Zhang Genlin, a villager from Shenjiaxiang, Huatingtou, in the northeastern countryside of this county, was to be sold by her husband, but when he failed to do so, he locked her in a room with huge shackles on her feet, denying her food and drink. The local police station discovered this and rescued the victim, Zhang Xushi. As Zhang Genlin had fled, his father, Zhang Songbao, was detained along with Zhang Xushi and taken to the First Sub-station of the Seventh District for investigation. The details have been reported previously. It is now known that the case was further investigated by Section Chief Zhang Jiguang the day before yesterday. It was determined that the woman's father-in-law, Zhang Songbao, had helped his son, Zhang Genlin, to illegally use private punishment, which could not be tolerated. In addition to ordering the police to arrest Zhang Genlin and punish him, a document was first prepared to send Zhang Songbao and the victim, Zhang Xushi (with her shackles still on), to the Third Section of the Zhabei Branch Bureau. The staff member proposed the case and, after questioning, was instructed to photograph Zhang Xushi to preserve the truth of the shackles. After the photography was completed, the woman and Zhang Songbao were transferred to the Third Section of the Southern City Public Security Bureau. After questioning by the section chief, the woman's shackles were finally removed. It was ordered that the case be transferred to the court for investigation according to the law. Zhang Xushi had previously sued her husband for abuse in court, and the prosecutor had ordered her husband to take her back and not abuse her again. Unexpectedly, not long after, she was again beaten by her husband. She went to court twice to request an examination of her injuries, but the prosecutor again ordered her husband to take her back, believing that the couple should not harbor such animosity. If her husband were arrested, the animosity would only deepen, making it more difficult for the woman. Therefore, both parties were advised and released. Unexpectedly, after Zhang Genlin took her back, he harbored resentment because she had repeatedly sued him. He became furious and used corporal punishment, with his father not only not stopping him but also helping him. The daily suffering was indescribable. Fortunately, the police station rescued her this time, otherwise her life would have been in danger. After the case occurred, the local party branch, believing that such inhumanity should not be allowed to exist under the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun, sent a letter to the police station, requesting the arrest of Zhang Genlin and his legal punishment, as a warning to the cruel. It also sent a letter to the Women's Association, requesting them to send personnel to conduct an on-site investigation and provide assistance.</p>

Just as they were about to take them to the police station, they also arrested the woman's lover, Zhu Hongxiang, on the way, and immediately called the police and arrested them together at the Sixth District Police Station. After questioning by Director Ren, the defendant Zhu Hongxiang confessed that he was 23 years old, from Funing, and lived on the north bank. His mistress, Yangshi, enticed Jin'er, but he really didn't know about it. He was not arrested at his home today, but was arrested on the way, etc. Chen Yangshi confessed that she was 18 years old, from Funing, and used to work in a silk factory. She and Jin'er were sisters in the same factory. Today she came to my place to play, and the clothes were also stored with me, not enticed. However, she has been having an affair with Zhu Hongxiang for more than a year, and now because she does not want to follow him, she has been appointed to Yu Yonglin's house and plans to escape to other places to break away from Zhu, which is true, etc. After obtaining the confession, Director Ren determined that the defendant Chen Yangshi had enticed a young girl to take clothes and planned to abscond together, which was undeniable, so he sentenced her to wait for a document to be transferred to the local court for trial today.</p>
<h3>Adulterer Scares Away Husband</h3>
<p>Sock Factory Partner Destroys Property</p>
<p>Continental Hotel Files Claim for Compensation</p>
<p>Dong Boqing, manager of the Continental Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, recently arrested Guan Xiongshu, a lodger, and sued him at the French Police Station, claiming that the defendant came with three or four young men to open room 326. Before long, Guan suddenly destroyed the dressing mirror, teapot, and other items in the room without any reason. Therefore, he was arrested and requested to be held accountable for the loss. The police chief approved the request and ordered Guan to be detained. The case was sent to the French Court for investigation the morning before yesterday. First, the plaintiff filed a complaint about the previous situation, and then Detective Ni Xiafei reported that he was dispatched by the police chief to investigate the whole story. The investigation revealed that the defendant, Guan Xiongshu, was a partner in a sock factory, earning more than ten dollars a month. Only four days after entering the factory, he had an affair with a female worker. The female worker's husband found out and caught them both. At that time, the defendant invited the female worker's husband and others to the plaintiff's Continental Hotel to open a room for mediation. When they arrived at the hotel, the defendant knew that the reconciliation was hopeless and unfavorable to him, so he became desperate and resorted to evil methods. He deliberately broke the dressing mirror and other items in the room, intending to scare them away. Sure enough, the husband was scared away, but the hotel refused to let it go because the defendant had destroyed the property for no reason and arrested him. Guan Xiongshu confessed to the above-mentioned circumstances, but stated that he only had more than 20 dollars and requested a grace period to compensate. Judge Zhu sentenced Guan to ten days in prison, suspended for two years, and ordered him to provide a guarantee and pay off the remaining losses within one month. The money paid shall first be given to the plaintiff to collect.</p>
<h3>After a Prostitute Becomes Respectable, Her Romantic, Inferior Nature Remains</h3>
<p>Wu Zhisun's Concubine, Namely Qian Huiqing</p>
<p>Moving Mahogany Furniture to Escape</p>
<p>Wu Zhisun from Tianjin is engaged in military uniform business in Shanghai and makes considerable progress. Because of this, he often indulges in prostitution. Last summer, he met a prostitute, Shihua, and they were deeply in love, pledging their love. The prostitute, named Fang, was from Xishan and was only 21 years old. Soon after, she withdrew her name from the prostitute register and returned to her original name of Qian Huiqing. Wu rented No. 840 Mengnala Road to hide her, spending more than a thousand dollars to buy a complete set of mahogany furniture and all necessary items. In addition, they agreed on monthly expenses of 200 dollars. At the beginning of her respectability, they were able to live in harmony, but after several months, her romantic and inferior nature gradually revealed itself. She often thought of leaving. On the 22nd of last month, while Wu was at his main wife's residence, Qian took the opportunity to move all the mahogany furniture away. When Wu returned home, the phoenix had already left the tower. After investigation, it was learned that Qian was hiding somewhere, so lawyer Zhan Jifeng was hired to sue the defendant in the Special District Local Court. The day before yesterday, the defendant was summoned to court and confessed that she had moved the mahogany furniture as accused by the plaintiff, but said that the furniture was purchased with her own funds and is now pledged by her. The plaintiff has nothing to do with it, and the plaintiff still owes her more than 2,000 dollars, etc. Judge Yang questioned the plaintiff, who completely denied the defendant's confession. The plaintiff's lawyer, Zhan Jifeng, then requested that the owner or manager of the store selling the furniture be summoned to court to prove who purchased the furniture. Judge Yang agreed and adjourned the case, ordering the parties to prepare evidence for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Concubine Sues for Division of Estate</h3>
<p>Wife Expresses Unwillingness</p>
<p>After the death of a man named Jiang from Tongzhou, his successor wife, Gui, is now sixty years old and has two grown sons. Jiang also has a concubine, Lou, all living in their self-purchased home at No. 25 Tongzhou Road. However, Lou has no children, and the mother and sons of Gui treat her distantly, making it difficult to live together for a long time. On May 26th of this year, Lou quietly left. Gui not only did not try to persuade her to return, but widely published advertisements. Lou felt that this was too difficult to endure, so she filed a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court to divide the estate. She claimed that her husband's estate included a residence, 400 mu of fertile land in Kunshan, 20 rooms in Tongzhou, and 800 yuan in shares of the Yuanji Company on Fada Road in this port. She requested a division. The day before yesterday, the defendant, Jiang Gui, was summoned to court and testified that there were only 22 mu of land in Kunshan, only 46 mu and three bungalows in Tongzhou, and only 100 yuan left in the Yuanji stock. The family is large and it is impossible to divide the estate. Her eldest son also came to court and testified that he wished the plaintiff to return home to live and cook together, and they would support her until old age. He did not want to divide the estate. Judge Zhou questioned Lou, who confessed that it was truly unbearable and she did not want to return. The court asked her if the defendant denied having so much property, and since she was suing, she should present evidence to prove each item or state the exact location of the property so that it could be investigated. This cannot be accomplished with empty words. The plaintiff replied that the amount of property was what her late husband had said, but she did not know the locations and lacked evidence. After the lawyers of both parties argued, Judge Zhou ordered that the judgment be announced on the morning of the 13th of this month.</p>

<p>In the Caonitang of Yangjiadu, Pudong, Shen Deyi from Dongtai has a surplus house, which he rents to a person with the surname Mou. The day before yesterday, Mou's old mother died, but Jiangbei people are deeply superstitious, believing that a Yang residence is unlucky, so they threw the deceased person's pillow over the roof, saying that this could remove the evil spirits and bring good fortune. However, Shen did not allow it. An elderly neighbor, Qian Kaiwen, spoke out, saying that since the house was rented to others, they should be allowed their freedom and there was no need to interfere. Shen, believing that he was deliberately sticking his nose in, had a major conflict with him. Qian's sons and sons-in-law were numerous and dragged Shen to a tea house to reason with him, but the conflict broke out again.

Fortunately, Lu was strong and grabbed the young man, shouting "Robbery!"

He also said that at the beginning of the launch, it was originally planned to test the operation for one month to see how the results were before deciding whether to continue. From the observation of the past month, the operating results of the factories are still not bad. Although there are few losses in the management office, the center is very pleased because the united front of domestic goods has built a foundation here. It is intended that in the future, the matter will be developed and promoted, but this matter is a major matter, relying on everyone's efforts. Therefore, the leaders of the manufacturers were specially invited to discuss and seek suggestions to achieve perfection. Next, Cao Zhigong, Director of General Affairs, reported on the budget and implementation plan for the second month. Wang Yansong, Wu Zhihao, Pan Dechun, and others then successively expressed their opinions. It was finally decided that the department store would continue to operate.

On one side, collect enthusiastic domestic goods comrades to stipulate the plan of the permanent mall to express the united spirit of the domestic goods sector.

<h3>Tianchan Stage Will Perform a Charity Show</h3>
<p>To Raise Funds for Various Good Deeds of the Pushan Villa</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Stage in this city, recently considered that the Pushan Villa in Zhabei has been handling practical good deeds such as burying the exposed corpses and providing medical treatment and medicine in the hospital. Every summer, it also sets up temporary epidemic prevention stations, which are beneficial to local hygiene and the suffering of the poor. However, the area of operation is vast and the expenses are increasing day by day, making the funds quite difficult. He specially made a good wish to invite all the actors to perform their best plays for one day when the weather is slightly cooler next month. All the ticket money obtained will be allocated to the hospital's good deeds. The stage owner is so enthusiastic about public welfare and maintaining good deeds, which is admirable. It is thought that at that time, philanthropists and gentlemen from all walks of life will go to watch together, which will not only be a great pleasure for the senses, but also a joint effort to promote good deeds, which is truly a win-win situation and will surely be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Organs Urge the Court to Severely Punish Local Tyrants</h3>
<p>The Zhang Jinfeng Case Should Be Reviewed Immediately</p>
<p>According to the Kuomintang News Agency, the Seventh District Party Department of this city yesterday submitted a report to the Municipal Executive Committee, stating that the court's announcement of the investigation results of the Zhang case was unexpected and aroused public indignation. It is requested that the court be directed to handle the case impartially to demonstrate the party's spirit of the rule of law. It is found that Zhang Jinfeng, a local tyrant in Jiangwan, falsely encircled land and transferred it to foreign merchants. Since the municipal government ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest him and transfer him to the Shanghai Local Court for punishment according to law, it has been a year, but there is no news of the outcome. Zhang Jinfeng was released on bail with a price of 50,000 yuan and is at large, proud of himself. Local people are worried that this case will not have good results, and rumors are rife. However, the colleagues of the department all believe that the court under the rule of the party is far from the era of warlords. Such a major case has extremely sufficient evidence, and the rumors on the road are definitely not credible. Now, the Secretariat of the Ministry of the Army has forwarded the correspondence between the Municipal Government and the Local Court, and it is learned that the case has been investigated by the Procuratorate of the Court and it is considered that a decision of non-prosecution should be made, which is unexpected. It is found that the errors in the disposition document have been severely refuted in the Municipal Government's application for reconsideration, and it is no different from being completely destroyed. Originally, there was no need to repeat it, but it is believed that the law should be fair and the government should respect public opinion. Zhang Jinfeng, in the name of encircling land, oppresses the villagers, and then changes the use of the land to mortgage foreign merchants. His crimes are obvious and cannot be concealed. He has been fortunate enough to escape the law under the rule of warlords for many years because of his money and power. Now, fortunately, the Municipal Government has clearly investigated and arrested Zhang and sent him to the court for punishment. Then, the gentlemen of the court should be fair and punish him according to the law to extend the law and make the people happy. Who knows that the investigation results only end with the five words of non-prosecution, how can it convince the people and show the party's spirit of the rule of law? Now, the rumors are spreading and public opinion is boiling, and public indignation is aroused. It is believed that the Party Department has the responsibility to supervise the government. At the time of the Municipal Government's application for reconsideration, this document is submitted to the committee for prompt transfer to the Local Court. It is requested that the gentlemen of the law enforcement should handle the case with a good conscience and not let the local tyrants steal the net, which is not only the good fortune of the villagers, but also the good fortune of the party's rule. Respectfully presented to the Municipal Executive Committee for hearing. The Municipal Executive Committee has transferred it to the Local Court after receiving the report.</p>
<p>In another news, Zhong Renjie, the Municipal Government Commissioner of Gaoqiao District, yesterday submitted to the Municipal Government the evidence of Zhang Jinfeng's forced enclosure of people's fields, such as the summons of Shen Yueqing, a householder of Baoshan County, and the reports of the tax collection officials. It is said that the Municipal Government will transfer it to the court.</p>
<h3>Roberston Road Robbery Yesterday</h3>
<p>At about 9:00 a.m. yesterday, two robbers suddenly came to the Chen family at No. 54 Renshou Lane, Roberson Road, West Shanghai, at the intersection of Jisi Feier Road, on the pretext of visiting Mr. Chen. One robber was wearing a Xiangyunsha short shirt and trousers, and the other was wearing cloth clothes. They went straight into the Chen family's room. At that time, there was only a woman and a child at home. They were so frightened that they kept silent and listened to the robbers rummaging through boxes and cabinets. They were robbed of 20 yuan in cash, 50 yuan in banknotes, and two small gold rings before escaping. The victim then opened a list and reported to the Sixth District Police Station, requesting investigation and arrest of the stolen goods.</p>

<h3>Paint Industry</h3>
<p>Due to the reorganization issue, the Shanghai Municipal Paint Industry Association's Steering Committee, the woodworking group industry, invited the reorganization committee members from all walks of life in the Chinese Concession to hold a preparatory meeting at Hongyunlou, Fadama Road, at 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. Those who attended included Zhang Fukang, Ling Youqiao, Ma Zhigang, Zhou Shanqing, Huang Shouchun, Xu Guoqing, and more than 20 others. Zhang Fukang was publicly elected as the chairman, and reported to the public the purpose of the meeting and narrated the past procedures. Min Xingchu, the document representative, made a statement, stating that since this association was ordered to reorganize, it has spared no effort in publicizing and guiding the fellow industries for half a year. It has only been achieved now that the association members have filled out the membership certificates and registered with the association. Although those who are clear-headed and enthusiastic about public welfare account for 80% of the people, there are still those who are located in the Chinese boundary and have a high reputation, and were members of the former public office era, the board of directors era, and who have turned a deaf ear to this reorganization matter, which is really incomprehensible. It is found that the reorganization procedures of this association will be completed soon, and the National Government requires that the industrial and commercial association law must be completed uniformly before August 16th, so the deadline has been chased, and the member list of each group will be sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request a certificate of approval so that it can be reported to the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for approval and the date for the establishment meeting can be set. However, on the 6th of this month, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce continued to send a letter saying that according to the law, it is still necessary to investigate the capital amount of the members' stores in various industries as the standard for the Chamber of Commerce to collect membership fees from the industry associations. If the capital investigation report is missing or omitted when reporting the establishment, it is considered that the procedures are incomplete and the certificate will be issued slowly. However, it is found that the number of fellow industries in this association is large and scattered in all walks of life in the Chinese and French Concessions. It is impossible to complete it without asking the leaders of each road to bear the duty of investigation. It is inevitable that the law will be enforced and the hands will be insufficient, and the deadline will be exceeded and subject to illegal punishment. It has already been reported to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce according to the facts and has not yet received a substantive reply. However, if the investigation of the capital amount is concentrated in Dongjie and Xiaonanmen, etc. in the city, which are the areas where woodworking stores are concentrated, the leaders of each family have repeatedly sent letters to invite them to visit and advise them, but they have turned a deaf ear, causing the rest of the fellow industries to follow the example of the major stores and hesitate to move forward and shirk each other. The superiors strictly ordered and urged them, and the subordinates deliberately delayed, which really made the people of this association unable to handle it and failed to achieve success. Therefore, it is requested that the gentlemen who attended the meeting plan to remedy it in order to facilitate the progress. After public discussion, it was decided to elect another representative to go to advise and avoid delaying the progress. Next, the reorganization committee Zhou Shanqing, Ling Youqiao, the guest Lin Zhizhou lawyer Huang Hanxiang, etc. all gave speeches, and the reorganization and establishment of the paint association was detailed and clarified, and everyone was moved. Then, it was publicly agreed that the major issues such as the investigation of the capital amount to be handled before the establishment should be borne by the people who came to the meeting separately to fulfill their duties, and everyone agreed. After the discussion, a banquet was held until the stars shifted before everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<h3>Wuzhou Soap and Medicine Factory Replies to the Domestic Goods Labor Union Federation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Domestic Goods Factory Federation received a letter from Wuzhou Guben Soap and Medicine Factory, willing to display goods in Singapore, which stated that it had received a letter stating that it wished to participate in the Singapore Domestic Goods Mobile Exhibition and hoped to register with the association immediately. Since this move is related to promoting overseas trade, the factory expressed its support. However, the factory's personnel all have fixed positions and lack people who can be sent to trade for a while. If they can participate as a display, the factory will carefully select products and follow the display procedures and ask your association to transport them for exhibition. The expenses required, such as your association has a charter, please show it to us for compliance.</p>

<h3>The Story of World Literature (186)</h3>
<p>— Written by John Macy of the United States, translated by Hu Zhongchi</p>
<p>Chapter 48: Essays and History of Literary America</p>
<p>America's specialized historians have achieved excellent work. I am referring to those historians who are doing excellent work in the history of recording. Washington Irving's research on American and Spanish history is superior to creating the mild and humorous figure of Rip and Nickbacker's father. He paid homage to the young Prescott, who had begun to study and write the history of Mexico, with great courtesy, because he was blind and hindered. The history of Mexico made Prescott famous, and he went on to engage in the study of "The Conquest of Peru," followed by the history of "Philip II." I know from later historians that much of his work has been abandoned as history. However, he did not make any mistakes in the facts as far as the facts could be obtained. His books are still readable today. I am not giving testimony to historians, but to literary figures.</p>
<p>Mark Twain said when making essays and history of the books he treasured, "Parkman's thousand volumes if he wrote that much." Parkman had a greater interest in the northwest of America and the struggle between the English and French before the founding of the American Republic than "La Salle" and "Montcalm and Wolfe." Strict scientific historians may have attacked Parkman as a romantic. However, the subject matter he dealt with for years was essentially romantic, and although his book was not accurate until the last narrative, it was always persuasive until the last article.</p>
<p>Chapter 49: American Poetry</p>
<p>I hear the song of America, a changing chorus, I hear</p>
<p>— Whitman</p>
<p>Among all the forms of literature, among the specimens of all the forms written on the northwest coast of the Atlantic, American poetry has the least of the content and color and the unique vitality of the continent where the poetry is written. Apart from Whitman, who many readers do not regard as a representative of the American spirit, and apart from two or three poems written in local or ethnic dialects that describe several poems of scenery and subject matter that are especially peculiar to this country, most of American poetry can be said to have been written by English minor poets.</p>
<p>The derivative, subordinate, and secondary nature of American poetry is not necessarily evidence of the subservience of American poets, but is one of the things that proves the overwhelming power of English poetry. We can think in American style in prose, but we must sing in English style. American poets often do not feel like the French, Germans, and English do about their own country or a part of the country they live in. The issue of patriotism is not at all present here. The muse despises patriots unless she can make music from patriotism, and a poet's being an American is ultimately less important than a poet's being a poet.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Introduction</p>
<h3>Inaugural Issue of "Era Youth"</h3>
<p>— Guangmei</p>
<p>Sold on behalf of Da Guang Bookstore</p>
<p>The moment the words "youth" are mentioned, one immediately imagines lively, strong, and energetic young men. Youth is the most precious stage of life. The expectations for youth are exceptionally profound. Everyone knows that youth is the vitality of the nation and the hope for the life of the country and its people. The rise and fall of a nation depends on the state of its youth. The responsibility borne by youth is indeed significant. However, during their schooling, many outstanding students are unwilling to devote their aspirations to mastering what they learn, aiming to reach the pinnacle and serve society and the nation. But the reality is not so simple. After graduation, they often fail to achieve their goals. If we simply observe China in the past and even now, how many people with specialized knowledge, especially in agriculture, industry, and commerce, have their wishes fulfilled and are employed by the government? The idea of the government providing financial support for someone to study a certain science for life is even more of a fantasy. Even those who are employed by the government are often not using what they studied. Once these "learned-but-not-used" gentlemen take up important positions, their personal concerns are no longer an issue. They may still have the initial intention and plan to revitalize the country, but only on the political stage do they realize that many things cannot be carried out according to their ideals. Unable to fulfill their initial aspirations, it goes without saying that they become assimilated over time, becoming no different from the old guard. Under these circumstances, youth then generate the following two thoughts: firstly, the government does not pay enough attention to specialized talents and is therefore unwilling to focus on research; secondly, young students also compromise. As a result, the future prospects of youth become a major problem. Disappointment in their prospects inevitably leads to discouragement. In this way, all kinds of "isms"—defeatism, romanticism, decadence, pessimism, corruption, and deterioration—emerge endlessly. With the state of youth being such, coupled with the inherent static, conservative national character, we, the youth, naturally form this weak and unhealthy phenomenon, which has a great impact on the future of the nation. This phenomenon cannot be ignored today.</p>
<p>I have often said that from secondary schools upwards, no matter what school, if you analyze the personality, thoughts, and behavior of the hundreds or thousands of students within, you will find everything imaginable. The reason for this is the lack of a unified central ideology. Not only is this the case for the students themselves, but it is also related to the books they read. Chinese books lack a consistent central ideology, and China is a country that lags behind in everything. Therefore, much knowledge must be borrowed from foreign countries. Those gentlemen who are obsessed with foreign goods consider even the dregs of foreign goods to be precious. Furthermore, teachers also lack a consistent central consciousness regarding the future of the Chinese nation. They simply go their own way, even introducing ideologies and theories that harm the nation. This erroneous view creates the current state of ideological confusion in the entire youth sector.</p>
<p>We dare to believe that because youth lack a unified central ideology, they are dissatisfied with reality. Some are dissatisfied with reality but do not know how to reform it; others want to transform it but have no way to do so. Naturally, they feel pain in their minds. However, dissatisfaction with reality is not a bad phenomenon; otherwise, society would not evolve. In the future, the issue of guiding youth's thinking should be to bring youth with various different thoughts and paths onto the right track and establish a central ideology. History tells us that the only way to save the Chinese nation from danger is to awaken national consciousness as the center. However, there are very few publications of this kind. Since reading the "Manifesto of the Nationalist Literary Movement" published by the Chinese Nationalist Literary Movement on June 1st, followed by the publication of "Avant-Garde Weekly," this is certainly a cause for rejoicing. Recently, I discovered another youth publication, "Era Youth," and must once again solemnly introduce it to our young comrades.</p>
<p>Last night, I went to Da Guang Bookstore in Ximen to buy books. Upon entering, the first thing that caught my eye was not the artistic novel covers, but the newspaper-like "Era Youth." This is the inaugural issue of the publication. In addition to the inaugural editorial, there are Tang Zenghongyang's "Anatomy of the Morbid State of Modern Chinese Youth," Tie Seng's "A Bird's-Eye View of the Anti-Imperialist Movement of the World's Weak and Small Nations and the Way Out for the Chinese Nation to Seek Freedom and Equality," Xia Xuan's "Written Before the Era Youth," Zhu Jianbai's "Our Future Understanding of Literature and Art," Xu Zexiang's "Marching Forward for the Nation," and Yi De's "Era Youth."</p>
<p>I cannot copy the content of each article in detail. Let the readers enjoy them themselves. We only need to look at Li Zhengjun's words in the inaugural editorial to understand the attitude and purpose of the publication: "...The current chaotic state of the entire youth sector, how can we establish a central ideology? This is the primary requirement of this publication. What we ask is that the youth of the whole country work together to build a lighthouse in this stormy sea to guide youth. Secondly, we feel that the dispersal of the power of the youth sector is always a crisis for the country and the nation. This small publication focuses on gathering the scattered youth through resonance and consensus... Furthermore, we observe that in addition to the chaotic and negative phenomena in the youth sector, we also see a worse kind of decline... Perhaps there will be sincere comfort for the decadent youth. In addition, there are theoretical aspects of the youth movement that we want to contribute to this publication, but this is a major issue. We hope that the youth of the whole country will have a heated discussion on this. In addition, research on politics and economics and discussions on social issues are necessary methods for youth to seek knowledge, which is another mission..." From the above meaning, we can know the contribution of this publication to the youth sector. Therefore, I solemnly introduce it, hoping that our young people will have a copy in hand.</p>
<p>Franklin's Writings</p>
<p>Franklin's writings were recently compiled by Henry Srmytbe Jr., entitled "The Amazing Benjamin Franklin," and will be published by the Pennsylvania Branch of the Society of the Descendants of the American Revolution, printed by Franklin Printing Company, which Franklin founded in 1728. The book contains praise from contemporary celebrities, the most well-known of whom include US Treasury Secretary Mellon, Labor Secretary Davis, British Ambassador to the US Howard, and former French President Millerand.</p>
<p>Chaucer's Writings</p>
<p>Chaucer is the father of English literature. His "Canterbury Tales" is an immortal work. In the recent months, three editions are to be printed. One is included in the Modern Library series, one is a combined edition of the original text (Old English) and modern translation with twenty-four full-page illustrations, and another is published exclusively in modern English. The publication period is probably in April, which is most appropriate according to his prologue.</p>
<p>Wells' "Outline of World History"</p>
<p>Wells' "Outline of World History" was originally quite expensive. Recently, the American Garden City Publishing Company has included it in the One Dollar Collection. The plates used are no different from the Five Dollar version.</p>
<p>Complete Collection of Shakespeare's Poems</p>
<p>The American Morrow Company recently hired Yale University professor Brooke to compile Shakespeare's Complete Collection of Poems. The motivation was that a lady wanted to search for a complete collection in London last year but could not find one. It is said that the first edition has luxurious binding and is limited to only five hundred copies, which has already been completely sold out. The second edition has a smaller format and an unlimited number of copies.</p>
