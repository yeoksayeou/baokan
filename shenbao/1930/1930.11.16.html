<h3 id="c9">今後日本之處境 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>日濱口首相被刺。推測其原因。不外三種。一關於政黨競爭之結果。二關於靑年思想之激進。三關於經濟潮流之壓迫。此三者之狀態。非日本所獨有。而亦世界各國所同具者也。世界各國之具此狀態者。無一不影響於政局。無一不爲反對政府者攻擊之工具。今日各國政局之動搖不安。即受此三者之影響也。惟此三者之中。尤以經濟潮流所感之苦痛。最爲普遍·靑年被此潮流。而思想愈趨激進。政黨遇此潮流。而反對政府愈益加力。故惟經濟不振之國。愈足以牽動他種反感。而使政局愈陷於不安狀態。在此狀態下之政府。能用其緩和手段。因勢利導。順機疏解。其暴發也緩。若用嚴厲手段。壓抑逼迫。以使其平。則其暴發也驟。其所分别。不過如此而已。</p>
<p>日本兩黨之競爭。本甚劇烈。靑年激進思想之藴蓄。日見增進。而此次所被經濟潮流。致影響於其國民生計。亦甚鉅大。故其處境。雖與各國大略相同。而實則較各國更爲困難。濱口首相遇刺而後。其所以應付此種互相牽動之潮流。恐將愈爲不易。而幣原外相。乃起而當其衝矣。</p>

<p>▲第四盤江李常處險惡之境、不見起色、當四比二局後（史卜居勝）、江李忽見巧妙之作、博得采聲不少、但第七局仍歸失敗、殊爲可惜、反而形勢益趨危險、欲挽狂瀾、已不可能、史卜乃以六比三造成各二之盤數、</p>
<p>▲第五盤錦標關鍵、在此最後一盤、雙方再接再厲、决殊死戰、江李二人以聯絡之緊凑、作戰之穩靜、屢佔上風、史卜雖努力追至各三、但以下三局江李連勝、以六比四再勝、乃得錦標、與前日林邱之得草地雙打錦標、同爲華人網球界生色不少、</p>

<p>不可一世之西捕、昨被眞茹以二對零擊敗、大出意料、蓋該隊自在甲組賽中、出馬以來、二勝一和、隱然抱奪標之志、難料昨以零比二失敗於眞茹之手、錦標前途、可謂危乎殆哉、其失敗之致命傷、緣於守門被逐出場、而左翼衛金生左前衛赫雷之受傷離職、致恢復之希望遂絶、眞茹固以勇敢善戰者、惟失之過野、實非所宜、裁判員葛萊漢巡邊員吳炎章克立沙、</p>

<p>會塲門口。高懸白布紅字横額。文曰「上海各界慶祝總理誕辰第六十五週年紀念大會」。當國旗成交叉形。予九時前。往。門口已觀者如堵。入塲得上海市執行委員會宣傳部與三區六分部出版之總理誕辰紀念特刋各一册。一則刋有楊淸源等著作。以總理誕生。比世界警鐘。謂鐘聲所波及。不止中國一隅。東亞一處。全球均有關係。一則除刋王曉籟等文字外。并有總理幼時讀書處照片一幀。曰「翠亨廟塾及其附近」照上有一大樹。枝幹屈曲。頗有畫意。是日因來賓到者甚多。坐位均被佔據。故準時開會。正在唱黨歌。主席楊淸源穿藍綢袍。報告開會宗旨時。除述總理誕生於廣東香山縣翠亨村後生平事實外。并於一生事業中提出兩點。（一）發明三民主義。以救埀亡之中國。（二）革命精神四十年如一日。百折不回。奮鬥到底。希望到會者繼續總理偉大精神。奉行三民主義。以完成總理遺志。正在報告時。忽有一人年約三十餘。穿中山裝。手持書籍數册。排衆至臺前行三鞠躬禮。觀衆咸莫明其妙。旋悉渠因有事遲到。開會行禮時。未及參加。故特補行敬禮。則其信仰總理之深。於此可以槪見。市黨部代表吳伯匡君亦穿藍袍。演說時。謂總理有健康精神。故能不畏難。而與環境奮鬥。希望各同志鍜鍊身體。努力從事。市政府代表陳克成君穿西裝。演說時頗客氣。謂今日參加盛會未預備演說。現承主席之命不敢不從。拉雜意見向諸君報告。不是對諸君演說。計分三點（一）培養人格。（二）充實智能。（三）努力建設。分别說明。語甚詳盡。旋僑務恊進會代表許冀公演說。詳述三十餘年前。渠在台灣。與總理初次會晤時談及革命之經過情形。是日出席代表年在三十以内者佔三分之二許君所說。均係渠等未出世前之事。宛似學校内學生聽講故事然。咸昻首靜聽。津津有味。繼許君演說者。係新被荷政府逼迫回國之某華僑。詳述荷帝國主義之征收華僑入境稅。驅逐華敎員回國。反對國民黨。禁讀三民主義。不准舉行紀念週。以及入境時關閉多時。藉口檢騐身體等種種虐待情形。甚至聲淚俱下。不忍卒聞。全塲聽衆。有怒目咬牙表示不平者。當場提出議案。對於南洋荷屬政府無理壓迫我僑胞。主電請外交部嚴重抗議。中荷條約業已期滿。主電請外交部迅即宣布廢除。通過此項提案時。非特全體一致舉手。且大呼通過通過。一種激昻慷慨狀態。爲會塲所不經見。足徵人心不死國尙有爲。歸而紀此。以誌不忘。</p>

<p>閱上月二十九日本報。載有二十一歲男子。忽變而爲女子一則。爲之驚奇不止。男子者誰。諸曁沈天放也。自十六歲始。每月必腹痛便血。經各醫診治舉謂花柳病。獨王吉人斷爲女性假性半陰陽。施剖割後。行人工造膣。竟變爲女性。噫。洵異聞已。余夙嗜博好奇。凡怪異之事。靡不盡力鉤索。以資參證。似此男變女之事。姓氏籍貫。犂然分明。詎委巷流傳無從依據者所可同日而語。爰就古籍所載之類此者。臚舉如下。</p>
<p>漢書五行志云。建平中。豫章有男子化爲女子。嫁爲人婦。生一子。後漢書五行志云。建安七年。越雋有男化爲女子。時周羣上言。哀帝時亦有此異。江南野史云。南唐後主時。廬陵歐陽子將娶婦忽化爲女。後嫁人生子。明史五行志云。隆慶二年十二月。靜樂男子李良雨。化爲婦人。情史類略云。洛中二行賈最友善。忽一年少者。腹痛不可忍。其友爲醫治。幸不死。旬餘而化爲女。事聞撫按。具奏於朝。適二賈皆未婚。奉旨配爲夫婦。萬歷丙戍年事。南陽府志云。天啓三年。唐縣有男化爲女。</p>
<p>上述六則。俱詳注出處異於無微不信者。惟江南野史載廬陵歐陽子化女與十國春秋所載爲曾某稍異。明史李良雨事爲隆慶二年十二月。乃二申草錄。則謂戊辰五月。本草綱目。又謂李良雨於隆慶元年正月。腹痛時作時止。二年二月初九日大痛不止。至四月内腎囊不覺退縮入腹。變爲女人陰戶。次月經水亦行。始換女裝。同一李事。月已不止兩歧何也。竊意此等考據。但取詼奇。無關弘旨。著述之例。兩說並存可耳。</p>
<h3 id="c188">胃病小言 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>

<p>拙著胃病大意一書發行後。蒙國人不棄。初版三千册。未及兼旬。已索去大半。於以知國人病胃者之衆多。而其求治之心殷。醫者當如何細心研究。體察病情。而療治之乎。</p>
<p>據各地醫院醫師報告。患胃病者以智識階級爲多。大抵敎育界銀行界報館書館中人最易病胃。此乃由於平時缺乏運動。勞心過甚而無休息所致。故平日之勞息。應有定時。每日一定之運動。至不可少。即輕微之散步。亦足以休養精神。助長體力。昔德國大哲康德。每日恒散步一次。得享高年。是其徵也。</p>
<p>胃病初起。僅須少食靜息。不必服藥。即能自愈。斯即自然治療之理。若一方注意飲食。一方再施藥石。病愈更易。否則僅恃藥力而不注意飲食。則自不易愈。不幸而轉入慢性。則療治更難矣。</p>
<p>新聞記者易患胃病。此乃因職務關係。飲食起居不能有定所致。而宴會繁忙。亦其大原。宴飲之後。伏案握管。最是傷胃。故新聞記者於宴飲後可略事休息時。則不妨多食。否則寗以少爲貴。而宴會主人對於記者。亦當另眼相看。切不可相强。須知强人多食。是促其致病也。</p>
<p>胃病治療之後。胃口必大增進。此時當特别注意飲食之衛生。零星小食。更宜切戒。斯乃復原時之必然現象。患胃病者不可不愼也。</p>
<p>胃臟之衛生及預防胃病之方法。千言萬語。不外兩個定字。即一定之時間。一定之食量。胃病起因大都由於多食過飽而來。故未病時能守此定例。胃必不病。旣病後能守此定例。病愈自易。</p>

<p>滇緬交界處。尙有許多種窑粟之地。故鴉片於此出產。而消售各國。此物遂難禁止。價太昂。一切人嗜利。大利所在。不可遏抑。又從滇出發向各國山地並無嚴查。故私人往來旱道。未嘗不自由。又無須護照。甚難禁止也。緬北華人。不論小工。面一望而帶烟色。亦可憐也。因之加一種迷信云凡在礦山工作者。不吃鴉片。不能避瘴氣。余日。此一定出於吸烟謠言。或迷信也。昔余鄉死土匪甚多。或恨之而吃其心。遂沿成吃人心之俗。且迷信云。可以治病。每個四千五百文。比亦製造迷信之一種。尤可笑者。十五六年出發韶關時。余由韶關。到南雄。由南雄到江西大庚一帶。其抬轎夫必吃大烟。黑瘦如鬼。余憐而問之。日汝等何以吃大烟乎。其答乃匪夷所思。曰余等不吃大烟。如何能抬轎。余腹大笑而無法向彼說明之。彼始終不悟抬轎乃吃大烟之結果。而彼乃倒因爲果。以爲非吃大烟。則抬不動轎。天下可笑之事。往往如此。今北緬人製造此種謠言。亦類也。</p>
<p>八日始有南渡Namtu火車到拿描。乃上車。價二盾。其散蓬車價半盾。車中逢諸印度人。問以甘地事。答已被英人送入邦卑獄。問吾等應以如何稱呼甘地。可否稱先生。彼答吾印人均稱之爲靡訶大末。蓋即大雄之意。問君等信聖雄甘地。可救汝而得自由乎。曰然。甘地信回敎否。曰否。是佛敎否。曰近之。然乃印度敎也。曰吾常有大疑。何以吾東方皆信佛。而汝本國不信而信印度敎。果何故。答各有其優點。問汝信甘地。較吾國孫中山何如。答中山遠不如甘地也。余曰。甘地是從哲學宗敎上顯得高遠。而中山在革命事業上偉大。又我國革命現已十之七八成功。而印度尙早也。答云。我無器械耳。余曰。誠然。仍須努力。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　四廂彈淚惆悵紅情　一座傾心低徊綠意</p>
<p>林蕃滋道。奇了。龍先生向來呌局。不取泛濫主義。可以稱之爲一個忠實的客人。怎麽也跳起槽來了呢。龍紫耘道。並沒有跳什麽槽。這個綠意。也是鮑家的人。我昨天已呌過鮑媚雲的堂唱。知道伊這兩天受了點感胃。發寒熱不能出來。是一個小阿囡來代的。那個小阿囡。却另外有一塊牌子。名字就喚做綠意。也是他們包下來的。面孔倒不差。人也極文靜的。横豎都阿素來跟的。寫媚雲。寫綠意。也終歸一樣。原來那個普慶里鮑家。稱之爲鮑氏五雲。他們有鮑素雲。鮑雅雲。鮑媚雲等等。一共有五個雲。譬如嫁了一個鮑素雲以後。再補入一個。也仍舊呌鮑素雲。一個客人。在兩節以前。呌過鮑素雲的。忽然出門去了半年。回到上海。再去呌鮑素雲。鮑素雲果然來了。但是已換了一人。令人有名是人非之感。他們也常在那裏推陳出新。一代代的傳下去。所以翻出騰倒。常常用這幾個名字。以資號召。惟有爲之主者。却是屹然不動。他們稱之爲本家。本家也有女兒。有的仍舊敎伊操賣笑生涯。克紹箕裘之業。有的說是不再敎伊吃這碗斷命堂子飯的了。或者送到三馬路女堂去讀書。或者敎伊在小房子裏。不讓伊到生意上來。起初說說。倒也很好。他們也知道開堂子是作孽的事體。破了許多好人家女子的貞操。壞了許多好人家子弟的品行。以爲略有了幾個錢以後。便將洗手不做了。可是他們的環境使然他。他的女兒。終究還是走到娼門這條路上去。所謂「龍養龍。鳳養鳳。賊養兒子掘壁洞」。讀書人家稱之爲書香了弟。開堂子的只可稱之爲賣笑世家那末這種本家的女兒媳婦之類。往往稱之爲小本家。小本家很有出色當行的。因爲他們所包來買來的小姐。時時更換變遷。惟有小本家。是守住那個大本營。在那裏主任一切的。現在龍紫耘口中所說的阿素。伊是鮑家開堂子的女兒。就是一個小本家的身分。今年也不過十九歲。是個長身玉立。媚視烟行。最甜俏的一個跟局阿姐。第一。就是伊的應酬工夫好。對於那一等客人。說一那等話。而且是詼諧雜作。談笑風生。眞是一個聰明伶俐人。倘然世界上眞有交際一科的考試。在不分性别時代。伊一定可以考到一個交際女博士。</p>

<h3 id="e8">Summary of Various Proposals: Proposal to Convene the National Assembly <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The original text of the presidium's proposal to convene the National Assembly is as follows:</p>
<p>"The current war to suppress the rebellion is the foundation for the nation's lasting peace and true unification. It is imperative to determine the date for convening the National Assembly as the military campaign ends, to meet the expectations of the people nationwide. Our party adheres to the teachings of the late premier and bears the heavy responsibility of building the nation. The political power that the people of the Republic of China should exercise is exercised on their behalf by our party, in order to protect the healthy development of the Republic of China from the poison of autocratic remnants. At the beginning of the period of political tutelage, all fundamental national construction issues should be agreed upon with the people, in order to unify the will and concentrate the strength of the people nationwide to establish the foundation of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and to clarify the responsibilities of our party during its rule. This is why the National Assembly should be convened urgently. The reason why the decision to convene the National Assembly was not made immediately when the capital was established and the five-yuan system was established in the capital two years ago was that unification had just been achieved, and the bad habits of warlord separatism had not been completely broken. It was deeply feared that at the time of convening the National Assembly, there would inevitably be those who rely on military force, hijacking elections, buying politicians, and falsifying public opinion, which would lead to disputes and hinder construction. Therefore, we first engaged in the disbandment conference to eliminate warlords in practice and reduce the burden on the people. Unexpectedly, this aroused the rebellion of false revolutionaries and true warlords, and the central government was also forced to send troops to suppress the rebellion. However, after this war, the warlords have been completely eliminated, and all political hacks, corrupt officials, and degenerates have nothing to rely on as tools to harm the party and disrupt the country. Discipline has been revitalized, customs have been renewed, there is hope for ideological unity, and society has a chance to stabilize. Therefore, the National Assembly has the possibility and necessity of being convened. Moreover, in this war, the rebel army gathered the strength of all reactionary forces in the country, but ultimately could not avoid destruction. Therefore, in the future, no warlords will dare to undermine unification and betray the party and the country. All reactionary elements have lost their reliance in terms of strength and have no way to cause trouble again. Therefore, our party can now follow the late premier's will, convene the National Assembly, gather the will and strength of the people nationwide, and build our Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People. The date of promulgation of the constitution has been stipulated in the Outline of Political Tutelage, and it is appropriate to submit it to the National Assembly for formal resolution. We hereby propose that the National Assembly be convened on May 5th, 1931. The method of convening should be quickly formulated by the Standing Committee and promulgated by the National Government. We respectfully submit this proposal for your deliberation and decision. The entire presidium: Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Ding Weifen."</p>
<h3 id="e9">Proposal to Complete the Longhai Railway <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhi proposed to complete the Longhai Railway and extend it to Qinghai and Xinjiang to facilitate transportation and strengthen the border defense. He said, "I believe that transportation in the western frontier of China is blocked, culture is backward, and all industrial and commercial transportation businesses cannot be developed. As a result, the people's livelihood is declining, and all affairs are萧条. Coupled with荒旱 military disasters, there is no time to rescue the dead and heal the wounded. Although the central government has been planning relief efforts from time to time, it is a drop in the bucket and ultimately has no great effect. Moreover, strong neighbors are watching, and it has not been a day or two. If this荒芜 situation is not treated, not only will the people in the western frontier become more and more poor, but also the border fence will be completely removed. Now, if we want to strengthen the western frontier and benefit the people's livelihood, we must start with transportation first. The proposed method is as follows: It is found that the western route of the current Longhai Line only extends to Lingbao. It is proposed that the central government borrow large amounts of foreign capital under the principle of equal and mutually beneficial treaties to use labor instead of relief to complete the Longhai Line and extend it to Qinghai and Xinjiang. Taking advantage of this flourishing construction, we can also recruit poor people from all over the country to participate in the work to achieve the effect of immigration and colonization. The rich resources of the northwest will also be gradually developed, transportation will be convenient, news will be communicated, and the border situation will be stabilized. And the livelihood of countless poor people in the northwest will be solved easily, without saying more. Is there anything appropriate? Respectfully await your deliberation and decision."</p>
<h3 id="e10">Proposal to Reorganize National Land <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Liu Jiwen proposed the establishment of a special central land administration organ to reorganize the national land. "Land is one of the essential elements of the establishment of a country, and the major source of food and clothing for the people. Regardless of whether it is an agricultural or industrial country, capital and labor must be based on land that produces natural goods before they can be used. As for the country's usage of land, although there are differences between national tax revenue and local tax revenue, the major end is actually only land tax and customs duties. Land tax is taken from漕糧渔盐, and customs duties are taken from transported goods. The source of their production is all in the land. Therefore, the land issue is a major issue for social economy and the nation's foundation. The resolution of this major issue should start with the reorganization of national land. Our country's land, in mountains, forests, rivers, and swamps, has never had a detailed investigation, resulting in the quantity of production and the actual amount of collection being difficult to accurately budget. There is cultivable land that is left荒芜, and there are areas that can be used that are left废置. Settlement is concentrated in areas that are already繁盛, causing supply and demand to fail to correspond, and disputes arise. Those who荒芜 置任任貨棄於地, and no one is willing to work hard, and both the country and the people suffer from poverty. Even in terms of tax revenue, because the land has never had a detailed and 核的 investigation, there is no way to know the quantity of production, and it is even more difficult to determine the actual amount of collection, causing胥吏 to take advantage of the situation to do evil, and侵蠧隐蚀, harming the people, while the country's usage is still bitterly insufficient. Therefore, the reorganization of land is really urgent today. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood emphasizes equal land rights, which is a way for both the country and the people to benefit. The details of the land are not carefully审, and the people are allowed to occupy it themselves. Although the official government occasionally has fish scale old books, they were not精详 in the past, and it is even more difficult to rely on them as信 because of distant generations. If we only rely on this and do not actually reorganize, fraud will be generated, the powerful will伸, and the weak will be困. It will be多所窒碍 to the implementation of equal land rights. In order to avoid窒碍, it is appropriate to reorganize the national land, and investigation and measurement are all 切要图. Once the investigation and measurement are clear, the division of mountains, forests, rivers, and swamps, and the distinction between use and荒芜, will be known in detail. How to start improving those who have used it, and how to plan and use those who have been荒芜, whether it will be 放垦 or租佃 or变卖 in the future, it will be easy to implement, and the implementation of equal land rights and the collection of land tax will not be 多所杆格. It is necessary to solve the land problem properly, so that the country has no曠土, the people have no游民, and农工物产咸有羡余, which can be推销于海外. There is an expectation of突进 in both land tax and customs duties, and the hope that finance can be unified, the national treasury can be充实, construction can be發皇, the people's livelihood can be策进, land rights can be 平均, capital can be 节制, and the country will日进于富强. Many provinces have already started to reorganize, but the majority have not yet进行. It is not enough to收整理 land, which requires the cooperation of the whole country. In addition, in the places where the communists in Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces have been to, it is heard that they have burned all the local people's houses and land deeds. It is especially necessary to set up methods to 清厘 as soon as possible to avoid disputes. Based on the above reasons, it seems appropriate to establish a special central land administration organ as soon as possible in accordance with the Land Law, so that the Land Law can be implemented ahead of time, and after implementation, the land administration organ can be supervised to carry out everything, so as to unify the affairs and收整理实效. Is there anything appropriate? Respectfully await your deliberation and decision."</p>
<h3 id="e11">Proposal to Determine Expenditure for Ambassadors and Consuls <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting proposed to determine the expenditure for ambassadors and consuls, designating funds to benefit diplomacy. He said, "After investigation,驻外使领 were originally the representatives of the country, and the responsibilities of diplomatic officials are extremely important. Therefore, all countries in the East and West have quite优渥 treatment for diplomatic officials, and the country's strength is exerted because of this. Our country's budget for ambassador and consular expenditure was set in the former Qing Dynasty and has been followed for decades without being revised. The usage is多费少, and it has long been unsustainable. Since the European War, the living standards of various countries have increased sharply, and it is difficult for the驻外各馆 to maintain the status quo. Borrowing foreign debts has caused the country to lose its信 completely. Since the completion of unification, the international status has gradually increased, unequal treaties have been amended, and concessions in various places have been 收,回 in order. The foreign weather has been completely renewed. However, due to frequent civil wars and huge military expenditures, the ambassador and consular expenditure has been欠拨 very much. Now, the salaries and other expenses owed to various embassies have been more than three months, causing various embassies to电纷驰 and call for assistance several times a day. There are also requests to resign and return to the country and find other livelihoods. The difficult situation described is based on the facts and are all compelled to 请. It is found that the annual diplomatic expenditures listed by various European and American countries are more than US$16 million for Germany, about US$11 million for the United States, about US$16 million for the United Kingdom, about US$9 million for France, and about US$6.8 million for Italy. Recently, Japan also has about 10 million日金. And telegraphic communication and temporary special expenses are actually paid and reported at any time. This is not included. Our country's核定 budget for ambassador and consular expenditure is 国币 4,428,752 yuan per year. Including all other diplomatic expenses, it is about 6 million yuan. However, the actual amount issued is 国币 less than 3 million yuan. Converted into US dollars at the current market price, it is only US$900,000 per year. Compared with the diplomatic expenditures of various countries, the difference is more than 倍蓰. Living in a country with high living costs, when the exchange is樽俎交, the inferiority is自不待言. This year, the gold is貴 and the silver is賤. The expenditure issued is无形折半. There was a request to change to金元 with reference to the previous example of customs duties. Although the State Council議决 passed it, it has not been issued yet. Now, according to the telegrams received from various embassies, the requests to increase salaries and expenses have been迫切. If this expenditure is not increased or determined, it will be必至驻外人员进退失据,使已去者为之寒心,未去者闻之裏足,不独对外政策难期贯澈,且恐各馆现状无法维持. Now that the military affairs have ended and construction is the first priority, if we want to seek the active progress of diplomacy and the full development of national strength, determining the expenditure for ambassadors and consuls and designating special funds is a fundamental plan. Otherwise, the spirit of refreshing foreign affairs will not be able to be expressed. (Methods) Please designate this expenditure. Before it has been allocated, it will still be paid in full each month according to the核定 budget amount and remitted on time to benefit the progress and facilitate the整理. Or it may be approved in accordance with the request of Wu Chaoshu, the Minister to the United States, to劃定 5 million yuan in customs duties each year and re-specify the salary rules. That is, 劃拨 and存儲 under the increased income number from customs autonomy each year as the ambassador's expenditure funds and paid on time without挪移. Moreover, this amount is still ordered by the Ministry of Finance to 饬逐月拨存 bank. At the end of each month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue a receipt to the bank in accordance with the核定 budget amount. It seems that there is no hindrance to financial unification. Is there anything appropriate? Respectfully await your deliberation and decision."</p>
<h3 id="e12">Capital Construction Fund Proposal <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, and Liu Jiwen proposed to designate one-third of the未經確定用途 Russian Geng indemnity and one-third of the Italian Geng indemnity as the capital construction bond fund to promote the realization of capital construction. The original text is as follows: I believe that capital construction establishes a national model,友邦瞻视, to accomplish this grand plan, raising funds is the first priority. Previously, the Third Plenary Session had議决原则通过 the plan to raise capital construction funds, and the principal and interest funds for the issuance of bonds were planned to be guaranteed by customs surplus. Appropriately, because of military affairs, the progress was blocked. Now, fortunately, the war has ended and unification has been achieved. The construction of the 京畿 cannot be delayed. However, the national treasury is not充, because after the war it requires費用 and it is difficult. In view of the difficulties of the times, it seems appropriate to兼筹并顾 and strive to not hinder the current national budget and enable the capital construction bonds to be promoted as尽利可能. It is found that the Gengzi indemnities returned by various countries have mostly been allocated for use. Those that have not been allocated still include one-third of the Geng indemnity returned by Russia, estimated at about 40 million yuan, and one-third of the Gengzi indemnity returned by Italy, estimated at about 20 million yuan. According to the resolutions of the central government, the Gengzi indemnities returned by various countries have been used for construction and cultural undertakings. Capital construction is of great importance. In order to establish a national宏规 and promote the national culture, it is essential among various construction and cultural undertakings. It is proposed to determine that one-third of the Geng indemnities returned by Russia and Italy, totaling 60 million yuan, will be used as the principal and interest repayment fund for the issuance of capital construction bonds. This will have no effect on the current financial situation, and will be consistent with the principle of use. It is a sure-win-win situation. The cases and proposals are based on the tube view. Is there anything appropriate? Respectfully await your deliberation and decision."</p>

<p>Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi was assassinated. Speculation about the reasons does not extend beyond three possibilities. First, it was a result of the competition between political parties. Second, it was due to the radicalism of young people's thoughts. Third, it was due to the pressure of economic trends. These three conditions are not unique to Japan, but are shared by countries around the world. None of the countries around the world that share these conditions are unaffected by the political situation, and none are spared from being used as tools by opponents of the government. Today's turmoil and unrest in the political situations of various countries are influenced by these three factors. However, among these three factors, the pain felt by economic trends is the most widespread. Young people are affected by this trend, and their thoughts become more and more radical. Political parties encounter this trend, and their opposition to the government intensifies. Therefore, the country with a poor economy is more likely to drive other kinds of resentment and make the political situation more unstable. The government in this state is able to use its easing measures, taking advantage of the situation and疏解 as the opportunity arises, and the爆发 will be slow. If strict measures are used to suppress and逼迫 it to平, then the爆发 will be sudden. The only difference is that.</p>
<p>The competition between the two parties in Japan has been quite fierce. The accumulation of young people's radical thoughts is increasing day by day. And this economic trend has had a great impact on the livelihood of its people. Therefore, its situation is roughly the same as other countries, but in reality, it is more difficult than other countries. After the assassination of Prime Minister Hamaguchi, it will be more difficult to deal with this kind of mutually牵动 trend, and Foreign Minister Shidehara Kijūrō has risen to bear the brunt.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Comprehensive Plan for Transportation and Water Conservancy <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Submitted by Zhu Jiahua, on a comprehensive plan for national transportation and water conservancy, weighing priorities to realize the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session. The full text is as follows: As noted in the political resolutions of the Third National Congress of our Party, the Congress believes that the economic construction that should be prioritized in the future is transportation and water conservancy. These two are the basic conditions for the development of agriculture and industry. If the country can achieve significant success in these areas, society will be able to release other significant new productive forces. This can be asserted with certainty. The root cause of China's current chaos and poverty lies precisely in this. To save the country from danger, one must start with economic construction. Although the country is riddled with problems, all needing attention, it is necessary to weigh the urgency of different issues and determine priorities. These two areas are truly crucial and cannot be delayed. Unfortunately, soon after the opening of the Third Plenary Session, Feng's rebellion caused military tension, affecting all aspects of governance, and the people's livelihood became increasingly impoverished. Consequently, these two aspects of economic construction were also affected, and progress was delayed. Now, fortunately, the great crisis has been quelled, the military situation has ended, and national unification has finally been achieved. Material construction should be pursued urgently to improve the people's livelihood, enrich their civil rights, and guarantee national independence. Jiahua respectfully presents his humble opinions on promoting the development of transportation and water conservancy as follows. Whether they are appropriate or not is respectfully submitted for public decision.</p>
<p>(1) Transportation Undertakings: Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Teachings. In a conversation with reporters from the "Min Li Bao" on railway planning, he said, "Transportation is the mother of industry, and railways are the mother of transportation. The wealth or poverty of a country can be determined by the number of railways it has, and the happiness or suffering of a locality can be measured by the distance to the nearest railway." This shows the great importance of railways. The adjustment of production to supply consumption, and the pivotal role of manufactured goods in exchange and distribution, all rely on convenient transportation. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen devoted his life to this endeavor, creating a national railway network plan with all his talent and energy. The grand blueprint is what our Party should strive to realize most earnestly. Now, the relationship between railways and the current national situation is further listed below for reference: (1) The issue of political unification: In the past, warlords occupied territories, forming a situation of separatist rule. Their greatest reliance was on the inconvenience of domestic transportation, which often prevented the central government from exerting its authority effectively. They were able to become powerful figures in remote areas because of transportation barriers, which prevented the central government from suppressing them. If railways are built, the central government can dispatch military forces to arrive quickly, and the warlords will lose their dependence. The implementation of government orders will naturally be unhindered. (2) Border defense issues: Russia's designs on Mongolia, France's intentions towards Guangxi and Yunnan, and Britain's plans for Kangding and Tibet have been brewing for a long time and are becoming increasingly urgent. Recently, with the completion of Russia's Central Asian Railway, Xinjiang and Mongolia are surrounded, almost engulfed. Looking back at our country's borders, doors are wide open everywhere, and we even allow others to build roads in the border areas between Tibet, Yunnan, and Vietnam, letting wolves into the house. The dangerous situation is truly unbearable to speak of. For the present, on the passive side, we must seriously stop the construction of roads across our borders and find ways to recover those already built (such as in Yunnan, Vietnam, the Middle East, and South Manchuria). On the active side, we should build our own roads to facilitate immigration and secure the borders, preventing others from plotting against us. Consolidating the border defense is undoubtedly the most important responsibility of railways. (3) Resolving the food problem: Currently, the domestic population is too large and concentrated in the southeast, where land resources are easily depleted, and the population is growing daily. The deep hidden dangers are already beginning to surface. The northwest, on the other hand, has vast fertile land, sparsely populated, which invites the ambitions of imperialists. To take both into account, immigration to secure the borders and promote land reclamation is the best strategy. To achieve this goal, the establishment of numerous railways is essential. Other benefits, such as cultural education relying on transportation for dissemination to achieve universal access, and people's customs being exchanged to make up for deficiencies and assimilate strengths, leading to improved national character, are secondary matters that need not be elaborated upon. The Second Plenary Session passed a resolution for the Ministry of Railways to prepare a railway construction plan using the Gengzi Indemnity and Customs surplus, and the newly added Xin-Long-Sui Line. Although surveying and construction have been carried out in order, the progress has been somewhat slow due to funding constraints. Moreover, the selection of routes is often biased towards the southeast, a densely populated area, which can only aid economic development. Except for the Guangdong-Guangxi and Hunan-Guangxi lines, national defense has not been taken into account. In the deployment of dense and sparse lines, some are forced by environmental factors, such as the Cangshi Line in the first group, which was added at the suggestion of Yan Xishan. Although the route is not unimportant, it was added only because Yan Xishan proposed it for his own convenience at the time. Moreover, He Chengjun later signed the Cangshi Railway loan agreement with Japanese imperialists, which damaged national sovereignty, which is even more hateful. Therefore, Jiahua believes that in addition to the four groups of routes currently planned by the Ministry of Railways, several border defense lines should be added. For example, the Chengdu-Lhasa and Lhasa-Lajiahui lines should be built to consolidate the Tibetan border; the extension of the Dihua-Yining line and the Dihua-Hotan line should be connected to the Xin-Gan-Sui line to protect Xinjiang; and the Zhangjiakou-Kulun line should be quickly completed and extended to Kyakhta, Tannu Uriankhai, and Khovd to prevent Russia from succeeding in its attempts to sow discord in Mongolia. These are all urgent plans. As for funding, the Ministry of Railways' original plan to use the Gengzi Indemnity and Customs surplus for railway construction is a fundamental national plan and should be given priority. If railways are not built quickly, the country will not be able to achieve prosperity and stability, and all other endeavors will be in vain. Once the railways are completed, the generated profits can be used for other purposes, which is a more balanced approach. However, the national railway network is extensive, and although the Gengzi Indemnity and Customs surplus are the foundation, the amount is limited. If we wait for it to accumulate, the process will be lengthy and time will be lost. The railway undertakings of other powers are progressing rapidly, so how can we afford to wait? Furthermore, the Ministry of Railways' original plan was to use these funds only to build the four groups of routes it had planned, which was barely sufficient. If the routes are extended, the funds will naturally be insufficient. After studying Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China," and the article "How to Develop China's Industry," we know that borrowing foreign capital and using foreign talent, while using our own plans to develop China's industry, is originally a beneficial endeavor. To expedite railway construction so that the national economy and people's livelihood can improve daily, it is necessary to absorb foreign capital as much as possible, which should be easily accomplished. As for national defense railways, the economic benefits may not be immediately apparent, and foreigners may be unwilling to invest. Therefore, a long-term strategy must be devised. In short, border affairs are becoming increasingly urgent and cannot be delayed. To secure the borders, the construction of border defense railways must be expedited. The people's livelihood is becoming increasingly impoverished, and to remedy this, the economic lines related to the southeast, southwest, and northwest must be completed quickly. As for fundraising methods, foreign capital must be absorbed for economic railways, and construction should proceed according to our own plans. For national defense railways that are not easily built with foreign capital, other effective strategies must be devised. The important thing is to take action immediately and not hesitate.</p>
<p>(2) Water Conservancy: Today, the severity of floods in China is almost as great as that of war. The provinces in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in North China suffer from floods, while the provinces in the upper reaches suffer from droughts. The areas around the Yangtze and Huai Rivers are also plagued by disasters every year. The provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Anhui invariably report floods annually. Therefore, both proactive and reactive water conservancy measures must be planned quickly. According to the three items of transportation development in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China," a comprehensive plan for domestic waterways is truly magnificent, but it cannot be achieved overnight. As for the waterways that are most urgent and in need of management, the five rivers in North China, the Huai River in Jiangsu and Anhui, the lakes in Hunan and Hubei, and the floods in the West River and North River in Lingnan are particularly pressing. Plans for dredging and guiding water flow cannot be delayed. Attention has been paid to this for more than a day, but little success has been achieved because the water management agencies are fragmented, with numerous branches, making it difficult to achieve results. Although the nature of water varies from place to place and cannot be governed by a single method, it is essential to have a comprehensive plan that considers the overall situation and details the circumstances, so as to gradually implement it effectively. If local authorities act independently, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, it will only become more chaotic. The result is that one wrong move can hinder the entire plan, undo all previous efforts, and, even worse, cause harm to our people. This is a great concern. Therefore, for the present, it is necessary to unify the administrative system and establish a supreme agency at the central level to control all national water conservancy affairs. All superfluous branches should be abolished to centralize authority and reduce waste. Then, leading foreign water conservancy experts should be hired as the backbone, assisted by domestic professionals. An investigation team should be organized, utilizing the existing experience of others to assist our country's talent. This team should be made responsible for conducting thorough and detailed investigations within a certain period of time on the most severely affected river systems in the country, regarding their geological, hydrological, climatic, and forest conditions. An accurate and precise plan should be formulated, weighing the urgency and importance, and separating the steps of addressing symptoms and addressing root causes. The plan should be gradually completed with full effort. As for water management funds, they are always extremely scarce. For example, according to the report of the North China Water Conservancy Commission, there was an original comprehensive plan, but the lack of funds forced them to retreat to treating the symptoms. In fact, the cost of treating the symptoms for ten years would have been sufficient to address the root causes, with something left over. However, due to the talk of treating the symptoms, superfluous branches emerged, public funds were wasted, and no progress was made. The expenditure was in vain, even to the point where everyone insisted on their own opinion and acted independently, making the situation increasingly chaotic. If superfluous branches are cut back and a unified system is planned, not only can much of the existing administrative expenses be saved, but also the national situation of financial surpluses and deficits can be assessed as a whole. A well-considered and balanced allocation will naturally be easier and avoid wasteful spending. Moreover, with precise investigation, the design will be complete and meticulous, saving funds. Talent will be concentrated, and opportunities can be assessed for timely deployment without the problem of idleness in one place and busyness in another. Surpluses and deficits can be balanced, saving resources and achieving success. Now that national unification has been successfully celebrated, these wealth-generating undertakings can absorb foreign capital under unified management to advance progress. The path may seem distant, but the results will be near. Careful consideration should be given to seeking long-term stability, which is the responsibility that our Party must bear in leading our people.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Proposal for Developing Agriculture <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Submitted to the Fourth Plenary Session by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, a proposal for developing agriculture by implementing military and industrial model farming and land reclamation, with 450,000 mu of reclaimable wasteland in the Northeast, including Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, the northwest, and Rehe, and 1,242,000 mu of reclaimable wasteland in the Northwest, including Chahar, Rehe, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. Ten thousand soldiers should be selected from the demobilized soldiers and sent to the Northeast and Northwest to carry out land reclamation as a model. After one year, civilian reclamation should be carried out in parallel. The method is to establish two land reclamation bureaus in the Northeast and Northwest, each with five sections: administrative affairs, investigation, engineering, immigration, and agricultural affairs. The land reclamation area should be delineated, with each district accommodating 50,000 people in the first phase. Each soldier will occupy 50 mu of land. The estimated cost is over 30,048,000 yuan, and 30 million yuan should be allocated from the demobilization expenses in three installments, to be received successively by the National Bank of China. It was also proposed to allocate funds for geological surveys to complete the initial construction plan for agriculture and mining.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Proposal for Rectifying Officialdom <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Submitted by He Chengjun, the proposal for rectifying officialdom is as follows: "I believe that human existence is essential for governance to thrive, and mere laws cannot implement themselves. Governance by people and governance by law cannot be neglected. Recently, the military affairs have come to an end, and the era of political tutelage has begun. Various constructions have intricate plans. If we want to achieve a bright and clear political system, it cannot be done by the effort of one hand and one foot. Therefore, rectifying officialdom is currently a crucial plan. I respectfully list my humble opinions below: (1) Punish corrupt officials severely. Currently, there are many public officials who are honest and self-disciplined, but there are also many corrupt individuals everywhere. Some collude with criminals and manipulate things from top to bottom, while others oppress the good and weak, extorting in various ways, or embezzle public funds to fill their private pockets. Their actions are unscrupulous, and the prevailing atmosphere is destroying the national principles. Compared to the late Qing dynasty and the warlord era, it is even worse. The failure of a country is due to corrupt officials, and the loss of virtue by officials is due to bribery. In the future, once corrupt officials are reported, personnel should be dispatched to conduct a serious investigation. If there is solid evidence, they should be severely punished, and the giver and receiver should be treated equally. If the personnel dispatched to investigate support or conceal the truth, their crimes should be the same. A heavy penalty should be used to govern a chaotic country, as this is the only way to show deterrence and purify the officialdom. (2) Determine the qualifications of public officials. The competence of public officials is related to the quality of officialdom. Therefore, the appointment of public officials must strictly examine their qualifications to prevent mediocrity. Currently, the Ministry of Personnel of the Examination Yuan has established regulations for examining the qualifications of public officials, and the National Government should order their strict implementation. Those who are not currently public officials but have the qualifications of public officials should also be screened and recorded first, pending appointment. Preparations should also be made to conduct various examinations to ensure that no talented people are left out. The appointment of public officials should be limited to those with qualifications, so that those who have not obtained these qualifications can avoid undue aspirations and eliminate the bad habit of competition. (3) Prohibit military officers from interfering in administration. Previously, during the military period, or wherever the military went, administrative officials were appointed, which was a temporary expedient. Or, matters related to administration were handled by military agencies beyond their authority, or administrative agencies occasionally received letters of recommendation from military officers, all of which were unavoidable due to the circumstances. This not only disrupted the administrative system but also made it difficult for military personnel, who were not familiar with administrative affairs, to achieve success. Now that we are working hard on political tutelage, we should select specialized talents for various constructions and use their strengths to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Military officers should not interfere in any way, lest they become an obstacle to the reform of politics. (4)</p>
<p>Promulgate safeguard regulations. Political tutelage and construction depend on collective efforts and striving for success, which cannot be achieved in the short term. Safeguard regulations should be clearly defined for officials at all levels, and those who can fulfill their duties should be allowed to stay in their positions for a long time and should not be easily replaced, so as to encourage progress. Once their positions are secure, the habits of pursuing personal gain and corruption can be eliminated. (5) Promulgate reward and punishment regulations. Reward and punishment regulations should be clearly defined for officials at all levels, and their performance should be evaluated regularly. Those who have made contributions should be rewarded, and those who have made mistakes should be punished, so that those who are diligent, cautious, and honest will be encouraged, and those who are negligent, derelict, and corrupt will be deterred. Once rewards and punishments are clear, everyone will strive to improve themselves, and everything will be accomplished. (6) Stipulate promotion procedures. The selection of officials at all levels should be based on strict examination of qualifications, and their promotion should be based on performance and follow the proper order. Except for those with special talents who should be promoted exceptionally, all others should not be promoted beyond their grade, so as to eliminate the bad habit of seeking advancement through luck. (7) Pay officials generous salaries. Since the rise of the revolutionary army, the central and local governments have called for the construction of a clean government, but some officials at all levels are still corrupt. This is due to bad habits, disregard for laws and regulations, unfair selection, and lax evaluation, but meager salaries are also a factor. Rewarding scholars generously is an ancient teaching. It seems appropriate to revise the salary standards and pay generous salaries to help cultivate integrity. The above seven points are all key points for rectifying officialdom, and for fundamentally addressing the issue, it is important to have the right leadership. The National Government should be instructed to carefully select high-ranking officials to set an example. Whether this is appropriate or not is respectfully submitted for public decision."</p>
<h3 id="e18">Proposal for Prospering Beiping <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Submitted by He Chengjun, the proposal for prospering Beiping to strengthen national defense, the original text says: "I have observed that Beiping controls the northern passes, connects to the Central Plains in the south, has a majestic terrain, and has been known as an important town since the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties and the early Republic of China, when it was successively established as the capital. Over hundreds of years of management and construction, all aspects of culture and material have gradually become magnificent. In recent years, due to the success of our Party's revolution and the relocation of the capital to the south, the area has suddenly declined. Chengjun, as the former head of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, witnessed the desolate scene and carefully observed it during his spare time, thinking about ways to prosper it. I believe that in terms of terrain, products, and transportation, it is possible to find a way to prosper the area. In terms of national defense, people's livelihood, and culture, it is even more necessary to find a way to prosper the area. Now, based on what I have observed, I propose the following plan:</p>
<p>(1) Promote it as the center of northern industry. According to modern major industries, the most important are the copper and iron industries and the fiber industry. The Beiping area has the Longyan Iron Mine and the Kailuan Liugou, Dongxizhaidang, and other major coal mines. All the elements for ironmaking and steelmaking are available. It is also a rich cotton-producing area in the interior and controls the transportation hub of Manchuria and Mongolia to the exterior. It is suitable for operating cotton weaving factories and easily collects raw materials for woolen fabrics. Moreover, there are numerous universities and a concentration of talent, which facilitates research and improvement. Railways intersect, and merchants converge, making transportation convenient. The price of land and labor are also low, making it a natural center for northern industry. The government should allocate large funds to restore the Longyan Iron Mine, so that the Shijingshan Steel Plant in western Beiping can smelt steel, accommodate the unemployed workers in the Beiping area, and supply the backbone for various constructions (each road purchases about 20,000 to 30,000 tons of train wheels from foreign countries every year). On the other hand, large-scale wool and leather factories and textile factories should be established, using the Ping-Sui and Bei-Ning railways to collect wool and leather from Chahar, Suiyuan, Gansu, Ningxia, and the three northeastern provinces, and using the Ping-Han, Ping-Pu, Zheng-Tai, and Cang-Shi railways, as well as the extensive automobile roads, to collect cotton from Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Hebei, and other places. Imitate the production of felt, woolen cloth, yarn, cloth, and leather products for civilian use to reduce trade deficit. If these two areas are fully developed and operated for many years, the key points will be established, and entrepreneurship will flourish. No land will be wasted, and no one will be unemployed. What is now seen as a desolate and abandoned capital will soon become a prosperous market again. (2) Maintain it as the cultural center of the country. Beiping has been the capital for hundreds of years, and its cultural undertakings have always been the best in the country. In modern times, it has become even more complete. In terms of education, there are the National Peking University, Normal University, Peking University's agricultural, engineering, medical, and art colleges, as well as the Palace Museum and the History Museum, which provide resources for scholars' research. In terms of art, there are magnificent palaces, temples, and mausoleums, which can be viewed by society, and the historical sites are the best in the world. Almost every grass and tree can represent our country's thousands of years of culture. In recent years, with the relocation of the capital to the south, all facilities have gradually declined. The government should recognize the area as the cultural center of the country and allocate funds specifically for the development of culture on a monthly basis, to maintain its existing facilities, further improve and expand them, and become an academic center and a gathering place for arts. Scholars will gather, tourists will yearn, and music will be revived, making it easy to restore the old appearance. (3) Designate Beiping as a military training area. Our country's national defense focuses on the Northeast and Northwest, and peacetime military training and defense should focus on these two areas. Beiping has a magnificent terrain, connecting to Liaodong to the east and controlling Mongolia and Xinjiang to the north. It is the general hub of border defense. Now that the military center has moved south with the capital, the ambitions of Japan and Russia are even more urgent than in the past. The government should designate Beiping as a military training area and relocate the most important military training institutions to the area. Heavy troops should be stationed in the various gardens, utilizing the heroic spirit of Yan and Zhao and training the brave men of Qi and Lu. In the event of a border crisis, it will be convenient to quickly mobilize troops. Even in peacetime, the use of its huge military expenditure and the large consumption of food can increase the vitality of the Beiping market. As for the past prosperity of Beiping, it was due to the gathering of citizens from all over the country. Since the government moved south and all deployments were withdrawn, the situation has plummeted. Now, if it is designated as a military training area, the establishment of various agencies directly and indirectly related to military training, as well as the residence of military officers and their families, will lead to a sharp increase in population and vitality. Although it may not immediately reach the prosperity of the past, it is also a way to gradually prosper. The above three items are very mediocre, but because Beiping is located in an important area and should not be allowed to decline, and because industry, culture, and military training are related to the foundation of the country, I have specifically planned them. Whether they are appropriate or not is respectfully submitted for public decision."</p>

<p>HamaGuchi's Condition is Good, Maruyama, the Police Chief, Takes Responsibility and Resigns</p>
<p>The Young Assassin's Actions Stemmed from Patriotic Beliefs</p>
<p>▲United Press of Japan, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch: Today's special cabinet meeting decided, in accordance with Article 8 of the Cabinet Organizational Law, to have Foreign Minister Shidehara concurrently serve as Acting Prime Minister.</p>
<p>▲United Press of Japan, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch: At 2:00 pm on the 15th, Dr. Shiota reported Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition as follows: From yesterday to this morning, 1,000 grams of Ringer's solution has been injected to maintain his strength, so Hamaguchi's vitality is still strong. According to the current situation, there is no danger of developing peritonitis. If he can hold on until tomorrow, it can be determined that there is absolutely no chance of developing peritonitis. Tonight, after fully adjusting the intestinal junction, he may need to drink tea. A sleeping pill will be injected tonight to help him sleep. No gas has leaked.</p>
<p>▲United Press of Japan, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch: At 3:30 pm on the 15th, Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition was as follows: temperature 37.4 degrees, pulse 92, respiration 15, no abdominal pain, progress is good. Also, at 6:00 pm, the condition was: temperature 37.8 degrees, pulse 106, respiration 19, the fever is slightly higher than in the morning, and the pulse has also increased. When stroking the abdominal wet cloth, the abdominal wall felt soft, but there was no pain, only a slight discomfort in the stomach.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch: Dr. Shiota visited Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition at 7:00 pm and told reporters that the Prime Minister's condition was not much different from noon. When asked if he had abdominal pain, he replied that it was not very painful. He also said that Hara Takashi (former Prime Minister) and I were both assassinated, and the Tokyo station chief must feel troubled. Thirty hours have passed since the injury, and peritonitis should not occur again, but at this moment it is still difficult to say that it will not occur. If there are no changes tonight, there should be no worries tomorrow, he said.</p>
<p>▲United Press of Japan, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch: Dr. Shiota performed the surgery on Prime Minister Hamaguchi's wound at 0:15 pm on the 14th. The Prime Minister was lying on the operating table, and because local anesthesia was used, he was conscious and his face showed signs of pain from time to time. Dr. Shiota, wearing a pure white surgical gown, began the operation at 0:37 pm. The doctor immediately discovered the marks where the bullet had penetrated, cut off part of the intestine, and examined it in detail. Dr. Shiota continued to operate and found the bullet in the hip joint, but it could not be removed at present and it was decided to leave it in place for the time being. At 2:00 pm, the wound was sutured and the surgery was completed.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch: At 2:00 pm today, Police Chief Maruyama visited Interior Minister Adachi at his official residence and formally submitted his resignation, taking responsibility for the Prime Minister's assassination. Adachi tried to persuade him to stay, but Maruyama was determined to leave.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch: Police authorities still do not want to disclose any information about the interrogation of the assassin who attacked Prime Minister Hamaguchi. However, the main reason for the assassination, the opposition to the London Naval Treaty, has gradually become clear. The assassin is similar to the one who assassinated Prime Minister Hara Takashi nine years ago, a frivolous youth who believes that assassinating the Prime Minister is a patriotic act. Japanese public opinion, including the Prime Minister's political enemies, is indignant about this. Major newspapers are wringing their hands, saying that this is a common occurrence in Japan, calling it a disgrace to a constitutional country, regardless of its purpose.</p>

<p>German Representative's Proposal for Direct Restrictions Was Vetoed, China's Representative Abstained</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Geneva, 14th Dispatch: Germany's motion to include provisions for directly restricting army war materiel in the Disarmament Convention was vetoed in the Disarmament Preparatory Committee today by a vote of nine to nine. The United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, the Soviet Union, Italy, Turkey, and Venezuela all supported the motion. France, Belgium, Japan, Finland, Poland, Persia, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia all opposed it. China, Britain, Bulgaria, Spain, Ireland, and Norway all abstained from voting. Similar motions proposed by the Soviet Union and Italy suffered the same fate. Therefore, the principle of direct restriction has been definitely shelved. As for Britain's motion for indirect restrictions within the budget, it was passed with 16 votes in favor, with only Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union against it. The remaining six representatives abstained from voting. Later, Chairman Loudon announced the news of the assassination of Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi and conveyed his condolences and wishes to Japanese representative Sato, expressing hope for the Prime Minister's recovery.

<p>Difference Between Gold and Silver Currency is 15 Percent</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 14th Dispatch: News from Mexico City, the Mexican currency has plummeted, and the banking and business circles there are quite anxious. They are currently consulting with government officials in order to prevent a crisis. The silver Mexican peso is 15 percent lower than the gold Mexican peso. Usually, the difference between the two currencies is only 3 percent. The US dollar value of both Mexican gold and silver coins has fallen. Today, 259 silver Mexican pesos or 224 gold Mexican pesos are equivalent to 100 US dollars. Many commercial firms are now reducing their business operations to wait for the development of the silver market. The Mexican government has recently withdrawn 10 million silver pesos in order to increase the exchange rate of silver against gold, but this and other equally positive methods have had no significant effect.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Polish Parliamentary Re-election <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Government and Opposition Parties' Situations: Roughly Speaking, the Central Left Wing Alliance Announces its Political Program</p>
<p>Pilsudski Will Continue to Hold Power</p>
<p>▲ Warsaw Dispatch: Poland's fourth parliamentary general election since its restoration has been set for November 16th. A total of 444 members of the lower house will be directly and secretly elected on that day, with equal voting rights for men and women without discrimination. As for the 111 members of the upper house, they will be elected on the 23rd of the month. In reality, this so-called general election is merely a test of the Polish people's trust in or distrust of their dictator, General Pilsudski. It is expected that after the election, Poland's major policies will still be controlled by Pilsudski. Even if the election is lost, he is determined not to give up the power he has gained. His intention is that if Poland wants to become a strong country, it must reform its constitution so as to create a strong and permanent new government that is not affected by the changing trends of the parliament. In this election, Pilsudski himself is also one of the candidates, with his name listed in both the upper and lower houses. As a result, the ruling party has greatly increased its power. Pilsudski has now organized a "non-party union" to cooperate with the government, which includes representatives from all three levels, upper, middle and lower, who do not belong to any political party, ranging from large landlords and industrialists to farmers and merchants. It is able to provide a lot of help to the government. As for the anti-government parties, they occupied a majority in the last parliament, but since being dissolved by Pilsudski, they have not been very united. The largest opposition force is the so-called "Union for the Protection of People's Rights and Freedoms," formed by the Polish Socialist Party, the National Labor Party, and three other peasant parties. Originally, the union consisted of five parties, but the Christian Democratic Party recently withdrew, leaving only four parties, referred to as the Central Left Wing Alliance. Many of its important leaders have been arrested and imprisoned by Pilsudski, but its power is still expected to be considerable in this election. In addition, the far-right National Democratic Party is also strongly opposed to the government. The party's policies fundamentally conflict with those of Pilsudski. Since the revolution of 1926, its power has greatly decreased, but recently there have been signs of revival. When the last parliament was dissolved, there were a total of 16 political parties, but in this election, the number of parties has decreased by about one-third due to the merger of various parties. The Central Left Wing Alliance recently issued a declaration, announcing its political program, which mainly includes relief for unemployment, support for economic recovery, improvement of the tax system, reduction of national expenditures, and at the same time, the organization of a sound government based on the people's faith and support, eliminating the dictatorial system. As the election day approaches, Pilsudski's high-handed measures are becoming more and more severe. Many of Pilsudski's current political enemies were once his close friends. According to general observers, in the future new parliament, the various opposition parties may jointly propose a motion of no confidence in the government, but even if it is proposed, the national situation may not change, because Pilsudski's power does not come from the parliament, but from the result of the three days and nights of fighting in Warsaw. As for the future of the election, it is also very chaotic. A certain famous conservative newspaper predicts that this election is like a blind man seeking the way, because very few Polish people are educated, especially in the former Russian territory, where residents lack knowledge and are incited by the Soviet Union, and the public sentiment is gradually becoming radical, which has a greater impact on the poor people without property. Therefore, the election result is still unpredictable, but one point to note is that Germany has recently been making great efforts to revise the border movement. If it becomes a reality, it will endanger Poland's security, causing the Polish people to be very nervous. The whole country is unanimously inclined to resist Germany. Therefore, at least on this point, the parliament and the government may have a kind of understanding, in order to seek diplomatic success. (World)</p>

<p>Preferential Treatment Continued for Three Years, No Results from Economic Events Discussions</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 14th: The report of the Imperial Conference states that overseas representatives have made the same agreement because Britain has undertaken to continue the existing preferential treatment for three years, but it must be subject to the sanctions of the parliament's own budget-making power, and within three years, it must not reduce the preferential treatment given to Britain, in order to show its response to the committee's report in favor of British flour mills, part of the wheat used must be produced in the Empire, and undertake to give it careful consideration. As for constitutional issues, the Governor-General will be appointed by the Emperor in accordance with the advice of the relevant autonomous territory's cabinet members, and the communication channel between the Emperor and the autonomous territory will be purely a matter between the Emperor and the government of the autonomous territory. The Imperial Conference approved the imperial broadcasting of radio services. Regarding this matter, the conference has asked the British Broadcasting Corporation whether the Imperial Broadcasting Corporation is willing to fund this expense. The Imperial Conference acknowledged the current economic difficulties and did not allow British immigrants to flock to the autonomous territories, but is confident that immigrants will be accommodated in the future. The Imperial Conference proposed to pass the petition drafted by the Legislative Committee of the Autonomous Territories last year, one of which advocated that any changes to the law on the succession to the throne or the title of the Emperor must be approved by the Parliament of the Autonomous Territories. The Imperial Conference also approved the establishment of an Imperial Court to resolve any disputes between the autonomous territories within the Empire, but the dispute must be automatically submitted to the court by the parties concerned.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 14th: At the last plenary session of the Imperial Conference, the Prime Ministers of the autonomous territories all gave speeches, stating that although there were no results in the economic aspect, there was no need to be disappointed, because they knew that the governments must adopt the principle of giving priority to their own people, and they knew before the meeting that the British government held special views on tax rates, because it had to consider the interests of the British people. Australian Prime Minister Scullin and Canadian Prime Minister Bennett both advocated the allocation of wheat import quotas as a substitute for tax rates. Indian representative Shafique said that India hoped to obtain the full status of overseas autonomous territory soon, and said that the whole of India, including the princes and the people, was paying attention to the day when it could send representatives to participate in the Imperial Conference like other autonomous territories. The Imperial Conference has a lot of work to do, and it seems that it should be held frequently, instead of waiting for four years.</p>

The representatives reported on the tragic situation of various places being ravaged by the Communist bandits, with tears in their eyes. The atmosphere in the whole room was gloomy. Then, Liu Zhi explained that the Central Government did not look down on the bandit situation in Jiangxi Province. The representatives were satisfied. After the banquet, a joint meeting was held. Each group elected one chairman to form a presidium, which included Fu Dingsheng (Beijing), Hu Jiesan (Wuhan), Zeng Yuchen (Shanghai), Ma Anbang (Yangzhou), and Li Yue (Hunan). They also divided into three sections: general affairs, publicity, and documents, and set up a joint office. It was decided to host important Jiangxi figures and newspaper reporters in Beijing at the Central Hotel at noon on the 16th. Next Monday, they will jointly launch a large-scale petition. The petition to the National Government from the Yangzhou representative is recorded below:</p>
<p>"We believe that the disaster of the Communist bandits in Jiangxi has been going on for a long time, and its poison is greater than ever. Ji'an, the center of the Gan River, has been lost, and Qingjiang, the intersection of the Yuan River, has been heard to have fallen many times. Famous cities have fallen one after another, and the provincial capital has been shaken. Where will our elders flee to their death? Looking around the West River, how much clean land is left? We, the people of the association, are staying outside, and we can steal our lives for a while, but where can we go home? In the past, when the state of Chu fell, Bao Xu still cried for the Qin army. Now, we are all under the same banner, how can Zhang and Gong be abandoned? Therefore, we, with our remnant bodies, make a heartfelt appeal. On the 9th of this month, we held a general meeting of Jiangxi compatriots in Yangzhou at the Jiangxi Guild Hall, and unanimously decided to list ten items and publicly elect representatives to rush to your government and present them to you one by one. (1) Please quickly send a large army to recover the lost land as soon as possible. Ji'an is the center of culture, transportation, industry, and commerce on the Gan River. After bandit alarms were discovered in western and southern Jiangxi, refugees from various counties and townships gathered in the county town, and the population became more numerous and the wealth increased. Since it was captured by the Communist bandits on October 4, the high-rise buildings were burned to the ground, and outstanding members were brutally killed. Merchants with some property were tied up as hostages, and farmers and workers who were ignorant were incorporated into the Red Army. They were still imprisoned women and raped at will, and condoned peasant bandits to kill at will. For more than a month, we have heard of hundreds of people being killed and hundreds of households being looted every day. The suffering and duration of the disaster have reached such an extent. Whose fault is this? Although it is not necessary to say, the authorities quickly send a large army one day, they can save the lives of the people for one more day. Recovering one inch of lost land one day earlier can save one place from ruins. This is the first thing that we are eager to petition for. (2) Please send a special commissioner to the front line to take charge of the command. Ji'an is located in the middle reaches of the Gan River, and it is the hub of Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, and Guangdong. Now it has been occupied by the Communist bandits as their base camp. To the east, they can enter Fujian, to the west, they can go out to Hunan, to the south, they can invade Guangdong, and to the north, they can plan the Yangtze River. It is not only a major disaster for Jiangxi, but also a deep concern for those who plan the country. If it is not regarded as the same as the overall situation, and the provinces were allowed to make their own plans in the past, it has caused the bandits to grow stronger, and trampled on Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi to such an extreme. If it continues to spread, what a terrible disaster it will be? The people pay taxes to support the army, and the state trains the army to defend the people. It is excusable if the military strength is insufficient, but the National Revolutionary Army has won hundreds of battles and destroyed hundreds of thousands of enemy troops with one blow, let alone tens of thousands of bandits. This is all because there is no special commander, and those who hold concurrent posts do not regard the importance of the overall situation, which has led to this situation. Can you specially appoint Liu Zhi, a victorious general from Jiangxi, to the front line to take charge of the command? This is the second thing that we are eagerly waiting to petition for. (3) Please thoroughly eliminate the Communist bandits within a time limit and do not leave any future troubles.</p>
<p>The Communist bandits had no real strength at first, but they lurked in the mountains and took advantage of opportunities to think. If the local military police had known to cut off their roots early, how could a spark have started a prairie fire? And after they became a large force, it was clear that they were like wild boars and long snakes, and they were only clowns jumping around, or they concealed their illness, or they flaunted their merits, or they only cherished their strength, or they used neighboring provinces as ditches. They nurtured the tumor and became a problem to this day. Now, to learn from the past and be careful in the future, we should not divide provincial boundaries and eliminate them within a time limit. And the elimination must be thorough, and there must be no guns left, and no bandits disturbing, so that we can say that we have exhausted the responsibility of suppressing bandits. Otherwise, the previous lessons can be learned, and future troubles are worthy of worry. This is the third thing that we are eager to petition for. (4) Please issue strict orders to reward those who have made contributions and punish those who are cowardly. The troops stationed have the responsibility to defend the territory, and the people rely on them to entrust their lives. They are free to advance and retreat, placing the people in water and fire, which is a crime that cannot be escaped. Even if they are ordered to suppress bandits, the armies are the cadres of the country and have the sacred duty to defend the people. Compared to those who oppose the rebellion, there is no difference. If, as before, they abandon the city and lose the land, without condemning anyone, how can we calm the anger of the refugees and achieve the success of the suppression? Now, we should issue strict orders, reward merits and punish crimes, and carry them out vigorously, so that we can be successful. This is the fourth thing that we are eager to petition for. (5) Please raise enough military expenses and avoid increasing the local burden. Jiangxi Province has been disturbed by bandits for several years, agriculture has been abandoned in the fields, commerce has been suspended in the markets, production has been cut off, and the storage has been empty for a long time. In terms of essence, it can be said that it has been lost. Now, in addition to tens of thousands of Communist bandits, the places they pass through are ruins. Even if there are remnants, they only have skin and bones. At this time, when the army is passing through, the supply of food will inevitably be difficult. Please raise enough military expenses, so as not to delay the military opportunity, and to avoid increasing the local burden. This is the fifth thing that we are eager to petition for. (6) Please strictly prohibit the army from burning houses in the disaster area. Before the 15th year of the Republic of China, Jiangxi Province had a family that was well-fed and clothed, and we had never heard of bandits. Later, because the Communist bandits invaded the people and advocated the theory of robbing property and inciting robbery and murder, the officials did not ask, and the military police did not save. Therefore, it became more and more intense. The wise people abandoned their homes and avoided places to avoid disaster, and the kind and cowardly people joined the gang to steal their lives. They are called bandit dens, but they are actually disaster areas. In the past, when the bandit suppression troops saw houses that had been stationed by bandits, they were all set on fire. The Communist bandits already knew this point and deliberately set up false opportunities in the homes of the people who were escaping outside, in order to use the burning by the National Army as a propaganda mouth. The local people know this evil plan the most, so they dare to sincerely present it. Even if it is indeed a Communist bandit house, why can't it be confiscated according to law to show punishment? At this time, when material resources are difficult and construction is not easy, we hope that strict orders will be issued to not burn people's houses. This is the sixth thing that we are eager to petition for. (7) Please strengthen the people's self-defense forces and strictly implement the Qingxiang. The people of Jiangxi are accustomed to a peaceful life and lack self-defense ability. Therefore, once they are robbed by the Communist bandits, it is easy to coerce them and difficult to extricate themselves. Now, the plan is to rely on the government to strengthen its self-defense forces in one place, and send personnel to clear the countryside, guide legal organizations, and distribute the guns and weapons seized from the Communist bandits to the people's militia. Because at this time of desolation, there is no financial resources to buy guns, and the Communist bandits' guns were mostly seized from the people's militia, so we dare to make this request, so as to make up for the inadequacy of the army. This is the seventh thing that we are eager to petition for. (8) Please strictly assess the responsibility of the Jiangxi Provincial authorities and quickly seek good aftercare. The state sets up officials and divides responsibilities, each with its own special duties. Defending the territory and protecting the people is their unshirkable responsibility. The bandit disaster in Jiangxi Province did not come suddenly or unexpectedly. Why did Ji'an, the center of the Gan River, abandon the city in a panic once it heard the alarm, and did not inform the local personnel who had cooperated in handling the Qingxiang self-defense on weekdays, and allowed the bandits to slaughter them without looking back? What crime did our people commit? This is what the people of Jiangxi hear the most and feel the most heartbroken. The past is over, so what more can be said? In the future, all rescue of the dead and wounded, and the peaceful gathering of the people, are hoped to be strictly assessed for the responsibility of the Jiangxi Provincial authorities, in order to save the remnants. This is the eighth thing that we are eager to petition for. (9) Please issue a clear order to exempt all taxes and miscellaneous donations in the bandit-affected areas. The places destroyed by the Communist bandits were during the autumn harvest. There is no production, so where do the taxes come from? After the recovery, we should first recruit the refugees and stabilize the villages. Issuing a clear order to exempt all taxes and miscellaneous donations is the most urgent task to win people's hearts. This is the ninth thing that we are eager to petition for. (10) Please send personnel to distribute emergency relief with the army to rescue the disaster-stricken refugees. The areas in Jiangxi that were attacked by the bandits were burned and looted extensively. They searched and extorted everything, so naturally there were empty houses and no one was not hungry. In addition, it is the end of the year and the weather is cold, and transportation is blocked. Orphans and widows are everywhere. The army is everywhere, although it can get out of the water and fire, it cannot treat the freezing and hunger. Please have mercy on the heavy disaster situation of the survivors after the robbery. With the great power of the government, send fair special personnel to distribute emergency relief with the army, so as not to die from killing, but from hunger and cold. And our central government diligently cares for the people, and has issued emergency relief in the war zone, and has also approved 100,000 yuan for Hunan. What about the hidden dangers in Jiangxi Province for several years, which have been discovered in a situation that cannot be cleaned up at once? This is the tenth thing that we are looking up and crying for. The above ten points are all the personal requirements of the Jiangxi people and the good policies that the country should take. Therefore, we dare not avoid the trouble and go to Beijing to petition. We hope that your government will have the intention of being hungry and drowning, and will show great benevolence and justice, and quickly examine and implement it. Then the 30 million elders in Jiangxi will be grateful for your virtue more than the nine tripods. We are extremely frightened and wait for your orders."</p>
<h3 id="e83">Hunanese People Urgently Request Chiang to Personally Suppress the Communist Bandits <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>▲The Communist bandits are more severe than Yan and Feng in three aspects▲There are four major drawbacks to the bandit suppression troops</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: The communist bandits in Hunan province have become increasingly rampant. After He Long, Kuang Jixun, and others invaded Nanhua in western Hunan, they also attacked Jin and Li counties. Kong Hechong, Li Shixing, Huang Gonglue, and others in eastern Hunan have entrenched themselves in Pingjiang, occasionally advancing towards Changsha. In recent days, they have been fighting with Tao Guang's 31st Division and Hou Pengqi's Brigade of the 15th Division in the areas of Shasha'ao and Genggutai. In Liuyang, Zhang Jingwu's gang has spread to the northern, southern, and eastern parts of the county, attacking the city from time to time. Chaling has already been captured by Chen Shao's bandit gang. Anren was just recovered by Duan Heng, the Southern Hunan Garrison Commander, on the 7th. Youxian is also under siege by communist bandits, and He Jian is mobilizing a large army to provide assistance. Furthermore, intelligence indicates that Peng and Huang's large force is about to return to their old nests in Pingjiang and Liuyang, and that part of Zhu and Mao's forces may also enter Chaling and Youxian, bypass southern Hunan, and go to western Hunan to liaise with He, Kuang, and other bandits. Therefore, the people of Hunan province are extremely panicked and urgently hope that Commander-in-Chief Chiang will dispatch a large army to personally oversee the suppression. The Hunan Post-Disaster Relief Committee recently appointed Huang Zhenyuan as its representative, along with representatives from various public legal organizations, Zhou Jiezhi, to jointly go to Nanjing to petition the Fourth Plenary Session and Commander-in-Chief Chiang for a swift suppression of the bandits. The letter presented to Commander-in-Chief Chiang is extremely earnest and is transcribed as follows: "We believe that the founding of the Party and the country has been fraught with difficulties and dangers. The Gui rebellion had barely been quelled when Yan and Feng rebelled in succession, and the communist bandits took the opportunity to stir up trouble in the southeast. Fortunately, Your Excellency personally led the punitive expedition against Yan, Feng, and other rebels, and victory has been declared. Logically speaking, these communist bandits alone should not be difficult to subdue. However, these bandits are under the command of the Third International. Since joining our Party in the thirteenth year of the Republic, they initially pretended to use the name of our Kuomintang to instill their communist ideology. Later, they openly plotted to seize the Party's leadership and attempted to turn our entire country red. Their hideous faces have been clearly exposed. Our central government had no choice but to take measures to eliminate the communists. However, the more they were eliminated, the more they grew in number, and today they have become a widespread and difficult-to-eradicate force. Compared to Yan, Feng, and other rebels, they are truly incomparable. We respectfully submit this to Your Excellency. Yan and Feng destroyed unity and willingly became leaders of the rebellious forces, still using the guise of propriety to scheme for a time. The communist bandits, on the other hand, spread their heresies throughout the country, poisoning young students and enticing ignorant farmers and workers. Even in remote and poor villages, they are brewing uprisings. Occasionally, when they are captured and dealt with according to national law, they still shout slogans at the time of execution. The depth of their venom is much greater than that of Yan and Feng. Yan and Feng occupied the northwest provinces, imposing exorbitant taxes and levies, and disregarding the hardships of the people, which was still the normal behavior of warlords. The communist bandits, on the other hand, are extremely fierce and cruel, and have no humanity. In recent years, the massacres in Guangzhou, Hailufeng, Changsha in Jiangxi, and parts of Hubei, Anhui, Fujian, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Henan, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces have been ravaged by them. Most of the cities have been reduced to ashes, and the villages have become ruins. The division of fields and burning of contracts in Hunan and Jiangxi, the conscription of men and confiscation of property, the seizure of wives for mixed marriages, and the establishment of schools to promote communism are even more shocking to hear. The intensity of their harm is also much greater than that of Yan and Feng. Although Yan and Feng had hundreds of thousands of soldiers, their momentum was greater than that of ordinary enemies. However, when confronting and fighting, they still did not lose the norms of military action. Therefore, once defeated, they would immediately disintegrate. The communist bandits, on the other hand, avoid the strong and attack the weak, and their movements are erratic. Wherever they go, local ruffians follow suit, and honest farmers are coerced. Like weeds in the spring breeze, they spring up everywhere. Therefore, each force, such as the Red Army, the Red Guards, and the Black Killing Squad, claims to have tens of thousands of men. According to various investigations, the communist bandits currently have more than 70,000 rifles, more than 600 machine guns, more than 6,000 pistols, and no fewer than 100 artillery pieces and mortars. The bandits' schemes are very cunning, and the bandits' strength is increasing. The difficulty of suppressing them is even greater than that of Yan and Feng. Since they are so deeply venomous, so intensely harmful, and so difficult to suppress, and considering the bandit suppression troops from all sides, there are several major drawbacks. Whenever bandit alarms are heard, temporary dispatches are made, each with its own circumstances, and must be carefully discussed. By the time the troops are mobilized, the bandits have already heard the news and fled far away, delaying the opportunity. This is the first drawback. The bandits' nests are mostly located in border areas. If they win, they loot everywhere. If they lose, they retreat with their loot. Our troops, even if they track and pursue them, will eventually return to their own province as soon as they cross the border, and the other province has no troops to attack in coordination. The boundaries are distinct, and the problem is allowed to fester. This is the second drawback. The troops from various routes do not cooperate with each other. Although one person is responsible for command, due to the distinction between host and guest, every order still needs to be approved. The army lacks discipline and is not conducive to military operations. This is the third drawback. The punitive expeditions against rebels are rewarded and punished by the state. If there are losses, they can be replenished at any time. The suppression of communist bandits is the sole responsibility of the local authorities. If they win, there is nothing special. If they lose, they can cover it up. Even if the losses are too great, they will disappear without a trace. Without a way to encourage and deter, who would be willing to sacrifice themselves? This is the fourth drawback. In short, the communist bandits are regarded as insignificant, so it is said that they are easy to annihilate. They do not know that the Yellow Turbans caused chaos in the Han Dynasty, and the roving bandits eventually led to the fall of the Ming Dynasty. Disaster lies in secrecy, and failure lies in negligence. Moreover, the communist bandits have become a force, and now take Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi as their central region. Their goal is to connect with the bandits in eastern Sichuan, southern Henan, northern Guangdong, southern Fujian, western Zhejiang, and northern Anhui to turn the Yangtze River basin red. In this regard, the trouble with Yan and Feng is just a minor ailment, while the communist bandits are a worry in the heart. Now that the minor ailment has been removed, but the worry in the heart remains. Even if there are plans for encirclement and suppression, there is no hope of realization. If it comes to the point where there is no other choice but to try to save the situation, it is known that with many troops and generals, there is no need to worry about defeat. However, military success takes time and will first demand many innocent lives. Hunan will become a bandit's haven, and there will be no survivors. We humbly believe that Your Excellency has received the heavy entrustment of the late Premier and is dedicating yourself to the Party and the country. Both at home and abroad, you are respected. Regarding Yan, Feng, and other rebels who shook the foundation of the country, you resolutely launched a punitive expedition and finally won the victory of the Three Principles of the People. You should not tolerate these communist bandits who openly sell out their country and are enemies of the Kuomintang. Therefore, we earnestly implore you to make a decisive decision, personally lead the victorious army of the punitive expedition, and implement the order to encircle and suppress them, so that the chief culprits and arch-criminals can be wiped out as soon as possible, so that the southeastern provinces can celebrate their revival, and the foundation of the country can be consolidated. In addition to sending representatives Huang Zhenyuan to come and pay respects and personally present everything, is there anything appropriate in the reasons for urgently requesting a personal expedition to the communist bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces? We respectfully request that you examine and approve it for implementation." (November 9)</p>

<p>The Case of Han Jinshi's Unclear Death Takes an Unexpected Turn: The case of Han Jinshi, the wife of Han Youjiu of the Gejia Lane in the Lvmen neighborhood, whose death was unclear, was reported to the Wudi Court by her nephews, Han Guoduo and Han Guolin, who alleged that it was conspired by the evil servant Shi Junqing and Chen Li, Han Youjiu's aunt. However, the autopsy revealed no fatal injuries. The Han brothers were detained and counter-charged with the crime. The initial judgment was three years of imprisonment for each of them. After appealing to the High Court, the sentence was reduced to one year and eight months of imprisonment. The Han brothers, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Supreme Court and filed a petition with the National Government, accusing Lai Gan, the prosecutor of the Wuxian District Court, and the lawyer Hu Shikai of colluding to engage in corruption and shielding criminals and framing good people. Chairman Chiang, upon receiving the petition, immediately forwarded it to the Civil Service Department for consultation with the Judicial Yuan and ordered the Ministry of Justice to investigate. After reviewing and verifying the matter, Acting Minister Zhu issued an order yesterday (the 15th) to Wang Simao, the Chief Prosecutor of the High Court, to thoroughly investigate and handle the case.</p>
<p>Crab Boat Robbed by Bandits: Lu Hongfu, a villager from Beida Village, Taozhuang Town, Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province, and his wife and five others caught more than 600 catties of crabs in Zhujiajiao, Qingpu, and loaded them into 31 baskets. They were sailing to Suzhou to sell them when, at 6:00 PM, they passed Dushuhu Lake outside Fengmen Gate. Suddenly, they encountered a bandit boat with four bandits armed with pistols and single-edged knives. They intercepted Lu's boat and robbed 26 baskets of crabs, weighing 586 catties, as well as clothes, silver dollars, and other items, worth more than 300 yuan in total. After the bandits fled, Lu Hongfu sailed to Suzhou that night and reported the robbery to the Third District of the Water Police, requesting a manhunt.</p>
<p>Huai'an Assessor Accused: Guo Weiran, an assessor of the Huai'an County Government, was recently accused by Gao Shaomen and other citizens of the county in a petition to the High Court, accusing him of bending the law for personal gain, being corrupt, smoking opium, visiting prostitutes, accepting bribes publicly, and having a notorious reputation. They requested that investigators be sent to thoroughly investigate and punish him. After receiving the petition, the High Court ordered the county magistrate to thoroughly investigate and report back for verification yesterday (the 15th).</p>
<p>Tianye Conference Sets Rent Grain Price: The Tianye Public Association investigated the market price of rough japonica rice in various rice shops in the city this year and determined that the highest price was around nine yuan and five jiao. Therefore, it convened a meeting of various warehouse owners yesterday to discuss the price conversion. It was decided that each stone would be limited to nine yuan, and a reduction of 25% would be granted in accordance with the order, and no excess was allowed.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Jinshan <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>A Wave of Banditry Sweeping Jinshan: The bandit atmosphere in the southern part of Jinshan County has become increasingly rampant recently. Liujia Yanqiao is where TaiBao AShu established his gang, so many bandits gather there. Other small towns such as Qianjia Xu, Qingdui An, Wanchun Qiao, Li Jialangxia, Nanlu, Dianxia Qiao, and Gaojia Qiao are also frequently visited by these people because they are very close to Liujia Yanqiao. From then on, a piece of pure land was completely transformed into a bandit world. Recently, it was heard that more than 30 bandits from Situan, Pudong, carrying four mobile machine guns and dozens of long and short guns, arrived at Liujia Yanqiao a few days ago to negotiate with Taibao Ashu, willing to join the gang. Tang Meisheng, the patrol chief of the Qianjiaxu Public Security Bureau, and the police officer Jin Qisheng (the younger brother of the notorious bandit Jin Fei) have been in contact with the bandits, so they did not resist when the bandits came to rob them, and later joined the gang. Even more unemployed vagrants have joined, so the gang's power has grown, and they are becoming more blatant and tyrannical. The recent cases are listed below: (1) Several bandits came to He Haoyong's house northwest of Jieli An at dusk the other day, rushed in and robbed them. Haoyong's wife tried to escape through the back window but was shot and killed by the guarding bandit. (2) After robbing He Haoyong's house, the bandits went to Shen Xiaomao's house southwest of Jiaolili An to demand bandit funds. It is said that they had previously received a letter from the bandits asking to borrow 2,000 yuan of silver. Xiaomao was unable to pay and had repeatedly broken his promise, angering the bandits, so they set fire to his house, which spread to the Zhou family next door, destroying more than a dozen houses and killing a Zhou family's ox. (3) Several bandits came to Ye Yunxiang's house in Qitu, southwest of Gan An, on the 8th of this month to demand bandit funds. Yunxiang was also unable to pay and had already escaped. Unexpectedly, Yunxiang's younger brother did not have time to escape and was immediately shot and killed by the bandits. (4) A Shen surnamed man south of Liujia Yanqiao was killed by bandits on the 10th of this month because he had a feud with them. In addition, Jin Quan jing's house in Fangtangjing, Shen Chuangen's house north of Qianjiaxu, and the Zhang family in Mapengtou have also been robbed one after another, suffering heavy losses. It is also said that the bandits held a meeting a few days ago and decided that all township chiefs in each township must pay 1,000 yuan in bandit funds. Those within the bandit's territory have now received a notice from the bandits. As for sending letters to various families to extort loans, it is heard everywhere and is difficult to describe in detail. With the approaching winter, the bandit disaster continues, and people from all walks of life are worried. Therefore, the southern township must have bandit suppression troops stationed there.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Jiading <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Settling the Account of Former County Magistrate Qian: Qian Baohe, the former county magistrate, suddenly left Jiading after the revolutionary army arrived. Two subsequent county magistrates, Chen and Ma, have not yet settled the account. Now, upon the strict urging of the provincial government, Qian sent Bao Yunyu as a representative to Jiading a few days ago. On the 14th, the Finance Bureau invited the Real Estate Department, the Education Bureau, and other departments to discuss the matter. Because the account books were not yet ready, it was necessary to schedule another meeting to calculate the land tax reduction of 14%. This year's cotton harvest is only 20% to 50% of the normal year. The disaster is even more serious in the eastern townships, where cotton accounts for 80% and rice accounts for 20%. Previously, the Provincial Department commissioned an investigation and determined that the entire county should be reduced by 78% and reported it to the province. Later, the provincial order did not approve it. The county government then proposed an 81% reduction to the province. Now, upon instruction, it has been decided to reduce the first district by 6%, the second district by 15%, the third district by 21%, the fourth district by 4%, the fifth district by 31%, the eighth district by 5%, and the sixth and seventh districts will not be reduced. The entire county will be reduced by 14%.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Wuxi <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>A Bizarre Murder Case in the Western Suburbs: The Rong family behind the Xinchun Tea Garden in the western suburbs of this county lives with Chen Shenshi, a 45-year-old woman from Jiangyin. Her husband, Chen, passed away 25 years ago, leaving behind a son named Jiabao, 25 years old, who is currently working on a drainage machine boat in Jiangyin's countryside. After her husband passed away, Chen Shenshi remarried Zhou Baoda, also from her hometown. Zhou works in a yarn factory in Jiangyin, but he does not come to Wuxi often, so Chen Shenshi, feeling lonely, became acquainted with Mao Ajin, a 25-year-old bathhouse attendant from Danyang. To avoid gossip, Chen Shenshi and Mao Ajin called each other "adopted mother" and "adopted son." This relationship had been going on for several years. The other night, Mao Ajin again stayed at Chen Shenshi's place. However, at 5:00 AM the next day (the 15th), Mao Ajin suddenly put on his clothes and hurriedly left. The landlord, the Rong family, saw this and became suspicious. They went upstairs to Chen Shenshi's bedroom to ask what was going on. Unexpectedly, Chen Shenshi was lying stiff on the bed, unresponsive. She had already died. The Rong family was shocked and immediately sent someone to Dongxin Road outside Guangfu Gate to report to the deceased's younger sister, Gu Shenshi. Upon hearing the news, she immediately rushed to her sister's house and mourned over the body. At the same time, she sent a telegram to Jiangyin to notify the deceased's husband, Zhou Baoda, and her son, Chen Jiabao, to come to Wuxi to handle the funeral. She also sent people to search for Mao Ajin, but his whereabouts were unknown. At noon, the ward head, Chen Zizhao, reported the matter to the county government and requested an autopsy. It is heard that the family plans to request the county government to waive the autopsy. The Culprit of the Bloodshed Incident at Beizhhaikou is Arrested: Zeng Haishan, a guest resident in No. 12 of the Junzi Workshop in Beizhhaikou, was suddenly attacked by thugs armed with knives at 1:30 AM on the 7th. Zeng's head and other parts of his body were slashed more than 20 times. The thugs immediately fled. Afterwards, Zeng Haishan was admitted to the Brothers Hospital for treatment, and his injuries are improving. However, Zeng's concubine, Yao Laoer (from Jiangyin), is suspected of knowing something about Zeng's murder. She has been detained by the Public Security Bureau and sent to the county government for questioning. At the same time, the police are closely investigating the thugs. Recently, Tan Baorong (working as a tea attendant at the Qitai Inn), a friend of Zeng Haishan, learned that the culprit in this case was indeed Sun Kundao, Yao Laoer's lover, who is now hiding in the Jiangnan Inn in Jiangyin. Therefore, yesterday (the 15th), he took a boat to Cheng and reported to the Jiangyin County Public Security Bureau, requesting an arrest.

<p>Inspection Measures for Transporting Rice Out of the Province: The Shanghai Municipal Government petitioned the Executive Yuan to order the Zhejiang Province to abolish the ban on the export of rice, in order to promote mutual circulation. The Zhejiang Provincial Government ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to discuss and respond. Yesterday, Director Cheng of the Department of Civil Affairs responded, stating that the province has not promulgated a ban on the export of rice but has clearly allowed people to transport it freely.

Therefore, it is proposed that merchants and people transporting rice out of the province for sale must first submit the quantity and location, and attach a guarantee that they will be responsible for transporting rice in case of shortage. The local government will then issue a passport. Merchants and people from outside who purchase from Zhejiang Province must have their local government consult with the government of the purchasing location to verify and issue a permit.

<p>▲ Continued Release of Merchant Ships: After the end of military operations, the central government continued to rent more than ten merchant ships to Pukou for transporting bandit suppression troops into Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan provinces, and then distributed the various divisions to the ports of Xunhan. Recently, the transport will be completed. In order to restore the river and sea shipping industry, various shipping companies have sent representatives to Beijing to request the Ministry of Communications to release the ships. Yesterday, this port received a telegram from Beijing stating that all of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River ships, except for the Jiangtian, have been released. Now, the Fair Winds and Prosperous Voyages and other sea ships have also been released and will arrive in Shanghai today. The Changxing of the Sanbei Company has also been ordered to be released and should be fully returned to Shanghai in about a week. Jianghai Hualun can be fully restored to service in the near future.</p>
<p>▲ Changsha Navigation: The Changsha route of the Chinese merchant ships has been suspended for a long time. This time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company appointed Li Yunliang to Wuhan to reorganize the Yangtze River shipping industry. Li has reported to Shanghai that the navigation rights in Hunan and Hubei have long been occupied by foreign merchants. A plan to recover and restore the route has now been drawn up. Starting in mid-November, the Changsha route will be restored, with five or six voyages per month, with one ship departing every five days. The Liyuan and Liji ships have been assigned to operate the route. Due to the shortage of ships, six large tugs have been chartered to operate as substitutes.</p>
<p>▲ Special Goods Can Be Loaded: The case of special goods from Sichuan being transported to Hunan and Hubei under official transport was negotiated by Li Muqing, the director of the Special Tax Bureau, with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which agreed to use the Kuailli ship to transport them. The first shipment was transported from Sichuan on the 6th of this month. When passing through Yichang, it was detained by the Yichang Customs, which considered it to be smuggled local products and refused to allow it to be transported to Wuhan. The ship was also detained. Later, Li Muqing went to Yichang to explain the situation to the customs officials and tax commissioners before they allowed it to be transported to Hankou. The matter has now been resolved, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will begin transporting the goods later this month.</p>
<p>▲ Flying Tiger Difficult to Salvage: The Sanbei Company's Flying Tiger ship, after being sunk by a navy warship in the Yangtze River near Hankou on February 23 of this year, was entrusted to the Rongchangcheng Salvage Company in Shanghai for salvage. After many attempts, it was found that the ship was submerged in the riverbed and could not be salvaged. The ship had reported an insurance claim of 80,000 taels of water insurance. It is now reported that the insurance company believes that this case is an accident caused by military transport and does not meet the repair rules for ordinary claims and may refuse to pay the claim. The matter is currently being negotiated, but there is no hope for salvage.</p>

We have also received letters from Committee Member Chen Kunxian, along with Defeng, Shunda, Hongda, and other members from Nine Acres, stating that after paying the annual license fees for tobacco products, the collection office did not issue formal licenses but only issued temporary receipts for the license fees. The receipts were stamped with a blue 'After investigating the business tax amount and finding it to be consistent, the formal license will be exchanged.' As a result, on the 9th, a stamp inspector mistakenly believed that these receipts were licenses that had not been deliberately stamped and detained them. The license tax was implemented during the warlord era and was a type of exaction. Stamps were not affixed. Previously, it was levied on locally produced water and drought tobacco. Our industry has long ceased to sell locally produced products and has stopped selling them for a long time. The cigarettes currently sold have already been subject to factory output tax and unified tax. Locally produced tobacco and alcohol have also been subject to public sale, landing, and license taxes. There are many types of taxes. Under the Qing Tian Bai Ri Party's rule, while abolishing exactions and miscellaneous taxes and relieving the people's suffering, the license tax should be exempted. At this moment, not only cannot the license tax be exempted, but stamps must also be affixed. For the temporary receipts for the license fees, stamps must also be affixed and then stamps must be affixed when the formal license is exchanged. This is truly taxing again and again, taxing on tax. Even if stamps must be affixed, they should be treated like invoices and receipts issued by customers to stores for purchases, so that the treatment is fair. All our tobacco, sundries, and grocery stores are small businesses, seeking meager profits and barely maintaining a living. At this time of rising prices and hardship, how can we bear this heavy burden? Therefore, we dare to state the facts and seek assistance, appealing to the authorities that, for the license stamps, during the period when the persuasion to affix is just beginning, it should be uniformly exempted, and all temporary receipts for the license fees that have been paid should be returned quickly so that they can be exchanged for formal licenses to ensure business and show compassion, etc., etc. We have received the letter and are copying it for your information, hoping that you will investigate and handle it."</p>

<p>▲ 2:00 PM on the 19th</p>
<p>The Commodity Exhibition Hall of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to convene a joint meeting of all Shanghai manufacturers and representatives of various industry associations on the 19th of this month to discuss the inspection of the commercial situation in India in order to develop overseas trade. The selection of personnel will involve recommending one or two people who are proficient in English and familiar with the commercial situation in China and India to serve in this position. A notice has been distributed yesterday, inviting them to gather in the standing committee room on the third floor of the association at 2:00 PM that afternoon for a meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Party and Government Agencies' Measures for Silk Workers <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Previously, all silk factories in Shanghai closed down due to the exhaustion of capital losses. Subsequently, the Shanghai Silk Factory Association convened a general meeting, where Chairman Shen earnestly persuaded them to prioritize the livelihood of the workers. At that time, he promised to make efforts to resume work, etc. This has been reported in this newspaper several times. The Shanghai Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and other agencies have paid close attention to this matter. After receiving separate reports from labor and management, they sent personnel to various silk factories in the Hongkou District yesterday to conduct on-site investigations of workers. They learned that although the Workers' Union had convened a general meeting beforehand, the workers did not approve the proposal not to work. However, Chen Zongxiang temporarily forced the mechanics of nine silk factories to sign, prohibiting them from starting fires and not providing power, making it impossible for the factories to start work. Also, many well-behaved workers were suffering from the long-term work stoppage and had a good understanding of the factory's difficulties in sluggish sales and losses. They were willing to temporarily reduce wages and cooperate sincerely, hoping to restore the original situation once the silk market improved. After receiving the reports from the investigators, the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus immediately invited Chairman Shen of the Industry Association and Standing Committee Member Zhu Jing'an to the bureau for detailed inquiries in the afternoon. The situation of chaos at the time and the current situation of the majority of workers were consistent with the investigation reports. An order was immediately issued to severely punish the ringleaders who were detained. At the same time, the nine silk factories were ordered to start work immediately and increase the protection of the police. If anyone caused further trouble, they would be arrested by name.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Japanese and American Banks Affected by the Silk Industry <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The sluggishness of the silk market in this port's foreign firms has attracted much attention from Chinese and foreign silk merchants. It is now learned that European firms have received telegrams from France and Japan stating that the East Asian Bank and another bank in Yokohama, which had the most mortgages on Japanese silk, have been stranded due to the sluggish silk market. One of the largest banks in Lyon has also collapsed, and the silk sales have been suspended due to the flood. This is why the overseas silk telegrams have not been forwarded recently, and the market atmosphere has become increasingly sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Inspection of Accounts for the May 30th Massacre Relief Funds Begins <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>▲ Distribution of Relief Funds Completed ▲ Books and Records Sent for Inspection Yesterday</p>
<p>The Relatives Association of Martyrs of the May 30th Massacre previously received 150,000 yuan in relief funds for the dead and wounded from the Public Concession through directors such as Yu Qiaqing. The funds were deposited by Director Yu in a bank for safekeeping. The distribution of relief funds was handled by Chen Fucai and Hu Changsheng, two representatives of the Relatives Association. Because the relatives of the dead and wounded were scattered in various places, it was not easy to investigate them at once. Therefore, the relief funds were not fully distributed until the 14th of this month, and all procedures were completed. The directors of the association, Yu Qiaqing and Cheng Xiechun, believed that the case involved Chinese and foreign attention, and the income and expenditure accounts must be publicly reported to gain credibility. They specially hired Chiang Hsin-chao, a CPA from the Xinzhao Auditing Bureau, as the accounting advisor to the association to inspect all the accounts. Yesterday, Chen Fucai and Hu Changsheng, the representatives of the association, sent five account books, along with receipts and invoices, to Chiang's accounting firm. Accountant Chiang personally counted them, kept them in custody, and began to verify all the 150,000 yuan in relief funds. In addition to the distributed funds and the remaining expenses, 13,000 yuan remained in the bank and was kept in custody by the directors Yu Qiaqing and others. It is planned to use it as a fund for the May 30th Martyrs Cemetery in the future. It is expected that the accounts will be inspected and a report will be prepared and submitted to various agencies for record and publicly reported in the newspapers within a short period of time. This case can also be brought to a conclusion.</p>

<h3 id="e112">National Products Association Receives Reply Telegram from the Ministry of Finance Regarding the Problem of Rubber Being Re-Taxed Upon Landing <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Products Maintenance Association previously reported that the products of the member Dasheng Rubber Factory were being re-taxed upon landing when transported to Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces, hindering sales. They telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to order that the tax be waived according to the case. Yesterday, they received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, stating: "(Omitted title) The association's telegram stating that the products of the Dasheng Rubber Manufacturing Factory were being re-taxed upon landing in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces, requesting that the tax be waived according to the case, has been separately ordered by the Ministry to the finance departments of Hunan and Hubei provinces and the Jiangxi Finance Special Commissioner to investigate and forward orders to stop the practice and handle the matter according to regulations. A telegram was also sent to inform you. The Jiangxi Finance Special Commissioner, Liu Hao, reported that since Jiangxi Province abolished the unified tax and implemented the special consumption tax, the names of landing tax, etc., have long been abolished. If it is a machine-made imitation of foreign goods, which has been approved by the Ministry, the first customs bureau or the transit customs bureau will verify that the goods match the bill and exempt them from tax. The telegram from the Chinese National Products Maintenance Association stated that Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces were collecting landing tax, but Jiangxi Province did not have this item. It was also found that the factory had received an order from the Ministry on August 5 of this year regarding the factory name and trademark, which was forwarded to the Inland Consumption Tax Bureau for tax exemption according to regulations. Besides re-ordering the investigation, the Ministry should first submit a written report. The Secretary of the Association has transcribed the order for the Dasheng Factory to check."</p>
<h3 id="e113">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphes Request to Study Egg Yolk Acidity <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Nanjing: "The American limit for the acidity of imported machine-made egg yolk from our country is five degrees. The Egg Factory Association telegraphed for relief. The association has submitted it to the Ministry for forwarding to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the United States. According to the association's report, many machine-made egg yolks have arrived in the United States but are not allowed to be shipped because they do not meet the limit. In order to avoid delaying the date, the association has directly telegraphed Minister Wu in the United States for nearby negotiation. However, the association found that the Ministry had previously instructed the association to improve the matter. According to the association, the egg yolk is below the limit when it is first made, but the egg factories cannot sell it immediately due to market price relations. The longer the time, the higher the acidity. This is unavoidable. Therefore, the association has requested a wider limit. However, this matter is related to international trade in our country and involves national health in the United States. Is the acidity of five degrees currently used in the United States fair? And how far should the limit be widened so that there is no obstruction on both sides? All of this must be studied from a scientific point of view. It should not be argued with empty words. The Ministry should order the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to study it first to find a suitable method to prepare for negotiation. This is what we are eagerly hoping for. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>▲County Side Nominates Five Appraisal Committee Members</p>
<p>The previous resolution on the allocation of stored grain between Shanghai City and County, with a ratio of 63 to 37, has been submitted to the Provincial Government for approval.

Therefore, the Finance Bureau has been instructed to inform the County Government for review and compliance with the resolution. The city and county sides will each nominate five committee members to form a stored grain appraisal committee. The county side has already nominated its members, including Yu Tingfen from the County Government, Lu Dingxin from the Finance Bureau, Shi She from the Education Bureau, Shen Zhou from the Property Bureau, and Wang Chengyao from the Property Supervision Committee. These five individuals were officially reported to the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday in order to schedule a meeting and implement the allocation.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Reply Regarding Responsibility for Business Collateral <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Chaozhou Sugar and Sundries Trade Association yesterday in response to inquiries regarding the responsibility for business collateral, stating: "In response to your letter of the 4th of this month, based on the request from member Jucheng Firm, seeking clarification on two points of doubt regarding the responsibility for business collateral, we promptly instructed the Commerce Department to dispatch personnel to investigate. The Commerce Department reported back stating, 'Regarding the case of investigating the customs of commodity collateral, we have now clarified the matter with all parties and recorded it as follows: (1) In the case where Party A uses white-made goods to obtain a loan from Party B, if the goods are not transferred to Party B, and the goods are lost or destroyed before redemption, who should be responsible? In principle, Party A should be responsible. (2) If Party A transfers the collateral to Party B, who should be responsible if the goods are lost or destroyed? In principle, Party B should be responsible. (3) Reasoning: The circulation of goods is inseparable from the creation, extinction, and transfer of the right to dispose of them and the responsibility for them. The responsibility for goods is determined based on the transfer of the above-mentioned rights. For example, when goods are used as collateral, the lender lends money to the owner of the goods, and the ownership of the goods should be transferred to the lender as security for the debt. The expression of this transfer is the transfer of the goods. If Party A is the owner of the goods and Party B is the lender, and Party A has a debt relationship with Party B but has not yet transferred the ownership of the goods (i.e., Party A's goods have not been transferred to Party B), then although Party B has obtained the claim, it has not obtained the ownership of the goods. Therefore, the responsibility for these collateral goods should naturally be borne by Party A. Conversely, if the goods have been transferred to Party B, then Party B has not only obtained the claim but also the ownership of the collateral. Since the ownership of the goods has been obtained, the responsibility for the goods should naturally be borne by Party B.' The above-mentioned investigation process is hereby reported, requesting your review and transfer to the relevant parties." Accordingly, a letter was drafted and sent in response, hoping that you will investigate, acknowledge, and inform the relevant parties accordingly. This is addressed to the Chaozhou Sugar and Sundries Trade Association in this city.</p>

<p>Following the news that Zhu Shaoliang has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Fujian and Jiangxi, Party headquarters, mass organizations, and Chairman Yang Shuzhuang in Fujian have all sent telegrams expressing their welcome and requesting Mr. Zhu to come to Fujian as soon as possible to eliminate the banditry, demonstrating the eagerness of the people of Fujian for stability. It is now reported that the Joint Federation of Fujian Associations in Beijing and Shanghai, the Joint Federation of Southern Fujian Associations in Shanghai, the Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association in Beijing, the Western Fujian Relief Association, and the Joint Federation of Overseas Chinese Associations in Penang, recognizing the frequent disasters and banditry in Fujian in recent years, which have caused immense suffering to the people, have taken advantage of the end of the Northwestern war to launch a campaign to save Fujian. Their goal is to request the central government to promptly dispatch Zhu Shaoliang to lead troops to Fujian to pacify the people and thoroughly reform the provincial government and implement political tutelage to achieve good governance. It is reported that they sent four representatives to Beijing on the 10th of this month to jointly petition the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee and the National Government with the Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association in Beijing. Furthermore, the Jin Hui Association sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman Yang Youjing, Division Commander Zhang Gan, and the Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association in Nanjing, as well as separate telegrams to Acting Chairman Chen of the Fujian Provincial Government and Brigade Commander Lin Shouguo of Putian, stating: "We have just received a telegram from the Xiamen Huian Association stating that Gao Weiguo's troops captured Dongyuan District in Huian County on the Gengri day, burning dozens of houses and killing and plundering countless people. The atrocities are still continuing, and the people are suffering immensely. Please find a way to provide relief." It has been verified that the burning, killing, and plundering of Dongyuan District by Gao's troops this time were extremely inhumane. Fellow provincials in Shanghai are extremely indignant and urgently request that a strict telegram be sent to stop the atrocities and order capable troops to suppress the bandits nearby to save the dying and exhausted people.</p>

<p>The Yangtse River Pilot Training Institute sent a letter to various shipping companies, including China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and San Peh Steamship Company, as well as various pilot associations, stating: "Regarding the case where the pilot trainees of this institute have completed their six-month training period, the Ministry of the Navy has dispatched personnel to examine them, and those who pass will be issued nautical training certificates.

All pilot trainees who have completed their training this year and those who were issued licenses between March 1926 and 1927 must come to this institute within the specified period to be examined at any time upon arrival. This examination is of utmost importance. All those who do not have formal nautical training certificates must come for the examination so that those who pass can obtain certificates and be eligible for the pilot examination of the Examination Yuan. Those who do not have formal nautical training certificates will not be eligible to take the examination. Please pay attention to this point. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby send this letter for your review and request that you inform all pilot trainees to comply accordingly."</p>
<h3 id="e123">Yesterday's Re-election of the National Pharmaceutical Association <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>▲National Government Representative Hu Hongji Speaks ▲Hoping for Unity and Improvement in the Medical and Pharmaceutical Industry</p>
<p>The National Federation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Associations is a joint organization formed by medical and pharmaceutical groups across the country. It was established on March 17th of last year. According to the regulations, the term of office for committee members is one year, which has long expired. Previously, due to the unfinished military affairs and inconvenient transportation, it was decided to hold a postal re-election, and the first meeting of the second session of committee members was authorized to exercise the powers of the representative assembly in order to revise the association's constitution. These ballots have been sent out for more than two months, and the ballot counting was held yesterday. The National Government telegraphed Mayor Zhang of Shanghai to attend the meeting nearby as a representative for supervision. On that day, the mayor went to Beijing for the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, so he changed the assignment to Hu Hongji, Director of the Health Bureau, to attend the meeting. Xu Shijin was sent by the Municipal Government to attend the meeting. The ballot counting ceremony was held at 2:00 PM. Eight members of the re-election preparatory committee attended, including Xie Qiheng, Jiang Wenfang, Xue Wenyuan, Zhang Xiongsheng, Zhang Meian, Fu Yongyan, Huang Baozhong, and Cheng Diren, which was more than half the number. There were also dozens of representatives from various medical and pharmaceutical groups. Zhang Meian was elected chairman by public acclamation. After the formalities, the chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by a speech by Director Hu, the National Government representative, who said, in essence, that if traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese medicine can be improved with scientific methods, it will be a sight to behold. It is undeniable that the traditional Chinese medical community has made little progress. I sincerely hope that the entire traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese medicine community will realize this themselves, unite as one, and strive for rapid progress. The so-called preservation must first seek improvement. Only by improving the track can preservation be possible. The National Federation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Associations should urgently gather medical and pharmaceutical groups from across the country, unite together, and carry out this great mission. We deeply hope to be realistic and pragmatic." Next, Gao Jianqing, a representative of the Sha City medicine merchant, proposed that the regulations on the management of medicine merchants promulgated by the Ministry have many clauses that are difficult to implement, and medicine merchants in various places have suffered from not being able to comply. The General Assembly has repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry for relief but has not been adopted, and the Health Bureau is eager to implement them due to strict orders from the Ministry. Since Director Hu is present, can we ask him to convey the suffering of the medicine merchants, grant relief, and alleviate the merchants' difficulties? Director Hu, the Director of Health, replied that the bureau was unable to provide assistance in this case due to the Ministry's orders. Now that the medicine merchants have requested a compromise, we will report the situation to the Ministry and extend the deadline for implementation slightly. Within the possible scope, I can also help the medicine merchants a little." Subsequently, Gao Jianqing and others were elected to accompany the supervisors to open the ballot box, and Zhu Hegao, Chen Chuxiang, and others were elected to call out the votes, and Yan Cangshan, Cen Binghuang, and others were elected to record the votes. The number of votes found during the ballot counting totaled 298. Due to the complicated procedures, the ballot counting was not completed until 11:00 PM. It was also heard that after the ballot counting, there must be a consultation to confirm whether the elected candidates are willing to take office, and then they will be reported for appointment in order to work together to promote the association's affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Various Reports on the Xiao Case Yesterday <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>▲Dutch Minister Requests Prevention of Boycott of Dutch Ships ▲Ministry of Foreign Affairs Replies That It Must Be Handled Fairly</p>
<p>▲Ministry of Foreign Affairs Negotiates with Dutch Minister Yesterday, according to a Nanjing special dispatch in this newspaper, the incident of Ms. Xiao Xin'an being insulted has aroused public outrage everywhere. Recently, the Dutch Minister to China has repeatedly telegraphed the ministry requesting that measures be taken to prevent the boycott of Dutch ships, as there are boycott actions against Dutch ships in various places. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to the minister that if the Xiao case can be handled fairly, this indignation can be quelled and telegraphed the relevant parties in Java to handle the matter seriously in order to calm public anger.</p>
<p>▲Support Association Issues Public Telegram Yesterday The Yixing Fellow-Provincials in Shanghai Xiao Case Support Association issued a public telegram yesterday, stating: "To the newspapers, all national agencies, organizations, and brothers and sisters, Ms. Xiao Xin'an of our hometown, Yixing, was hired as a teacher in another place and was insulted by the second mate and chief mate on a Java Shipping Company ship on the way. The details have been reported in the newspapers in recent days, so there is no need to repeat them. However, we believe that this matter is small in relation to Ms. Xiao's personal affairs and great in relation to our entire Chinese nation. Ms. Xiao, a weak and isolated individual, was traveling at sea and was brutally trampled on and lacked the strength to resist. She suffered this extraordinary humiliation in her personality. If we tolerate alien beasts indulging in their desires and acting recklessly without punishing them, how can we face other races without being ashamed to death? If we retreat and speak of individuals, who has no wife and daughter? Who has no sister? If one day the alien beasts become more aggressive and cause trouble, can we imagine it? Moreover, foreigners are watching the strength of our nation's self-defense, using it as a diplomatic compass for them. If we continue to endure humiliation or are even shameless, what will be the impact on our international status? The saying that 'Chinese people are a sheet of loose sand' has long been the established opinion of alien races about us. If we stand by and watch the Xiao case, what difference is there between casting an ironclad proof? How can we seek international equality? Therefore, we dare to weep and express our words, imploring the national fathers to rise up and fight for justice, demanding that the criminals be brought to justice and that the national honor be restored. Although our fellow provincials are few and weak, our enthusiasm remains. We dare to be the vanguard of the Chinese people and are willing to be the government's support, vowing to achieve our goals and then stop. Sincerely, the Yixing Fellow-Provincials in Shanghai Xiao Case Support Association." ▲Doubts Regarding the Chamber of Commerce's Telegram The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Batavia Chamber of Commerce, advocating for a legal solution to the case of Ms. Xiao Xin'an being brutally raped by the Dutch second mate and chief mate. This is slightly inconsistent with the enthusiastic boycott of Java ships by all sectors of the country. According to Mr. Lin Youren, a standing committee member of the Overseas Chinese Federation, Batavia is the location of the highest military and political organs in the Dutch East Indies, and the pressure exerted by the Dutch side is also the highest there. The members of the Batavia Chamber of Commerce are known for their love of their race and country, and their indignation at the Xiao case must be no less than that of people in the country. The reason for this unexpected telegram is that the Java General Company requested the local government to use violence to suppress it, or the Java Company simply imitated the despicable tricks of our warlords who "fabricated group names to send telegrams to cheer themselves on," drafting and sending a telegram on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce. We can only intensify our anti-Dutch work and fight for the freedom of speech of our compatriots in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Bloodshed in Changan Lane, Annakin Road <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>▲A Woman Died Horribly</p>
<p>▲Her Neck Was More Than Half Severed</p>
<p>▲There Was a Prostitute License Photo in Her Bag</p>
<p>▲The Deceased Appeared to Be a Prostitute</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, in front of house number 2, Changan Lane, 56 Annakin Road, French Concession, next to the north side of the Weiyang Grand Theater, a woman was found murdered with a knife. The deceased looked like a prostitute, and the circumstances were extremely bizarre. The detailed investigation is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Second Landlord Xie Zidan Xie Zidan, a native of Zhenjiang, is 63 years old. He used to work in a cloth shop, but has been unemployed for more than ten years. He married a widowed woman, Chen Linshi, who is now 62 years old. Linshi has a son named Chen Dengyuan, who is 43 years old and works as an assistant in the kitchen of the Puyi Yarn Factory wholesale office on Nanjing Road. Dengyuan is married to a Yuan woman, who is 43 years old. The whole family lives at house number 3, Changan Lane, Annakin Road. In addition to living in house number 3, Xie Zidan's family also rented a single-family Shikumen house at number 2 in the same lane seven years ago, serving as a second landlord. However, the entire house at number 2 was sublet to three tenants, except for a Yangzhou maid, Wu Wangshi (44 years old), who lived in the loft and looked after the house. The front building of the house was rented to a He family who performed operas, the back building was rented to a chef, and the downstairs hall was rented to the Chen and Jin families. Another pavilion room was newly rented to a Zhang family from Pudong on the 6th of this month.</p>
<p>▲New Tenant Zhang A'er On the 1st of this month, a middle-aged couple, looking like husband and wife, came to rent the pavilion room at number 2, agreeing on a monthly rent of six yuan and paying a deposit of one yuan in advance. They moved in on the 6th. The Zhang family claimed to be named A'er and worked as a carpenter at the Huajie Waterworks Company. Their luggage was very simple, with only a bed, a table, and two chairs. After moving in, the woman asked Xie's maid, Wu Wangshi, to wash the chamber pot for them, agreeing to pay a small tip of five jiao per month. Wangshi did as she was told and washed it for them daily.</p>
<p>▲One Person Laying Face Up in Bed Yesterday at dawn, Wu Wangshi finished emptying Zhang's chamber pot and placed it on the left side of the pavilion room's door. At around 12:00 noon, Wangshi went upstairs for something and glimpsed the chamber pot, which was still outside the door. So she knocked on the door and called out repeatedly, but there was no response. However, when she exerted a little force, the door suddenly opened slightly, and the door was already locked. At first, she suspected that the couple had gone out together. When she peeked in carefully, she saw a person lying face up in bed, with both feet hanging down and the upper body covered by a curtain. She called out several more times, but there was still no response.</p>
<p>▲A Horrifying Decapitated Female Corpse When Wangshi saw that calling out did not elicit a response, she became suspicious. She ran to tell Xie's daughter-in-law, Yuan, and they went back together. They called out again, but still there was no response. So Xie ran to report to the Songshan Road Police Station. The chief of police heard the news and immediately ordered patrol officers to rush there. They unlocked the door and entered, and there was a horrifying decapitated female corpse lying across the bed. The deceased's head had been more than half severed, with only a piece of skin connecting the back of the head. The bloodstains were blurred, and the scene was unbearable to witness. The upper body was wearing a red striped cloth short shirt, and the lower body was naked. The hair had been cut off, and the feet were natural and barefoot.</p>
<p>▲What Was Seen at the Beef Shop A blood-stained pair of trousers was also found next to the bed. It seemed that the murderer had smeared the blood from the weapon on the trousers. Two beef noodle bowls and a porcelain basin were still on the table. The patrol officers went to the Yang Shunxing beef shop next door to inquire. According to the shop, a man came there around 1:00 AM and ordered two bowls of beef noodles. At around 2:00 AM, the man came again and ordered twenty beef pot stickers. The first time the noodles were delivered, the woman was seen supporting her chin with her hand, looking sad. The second time, the woman was lying across the bed, but she was still speaking as usual. It is estimated that the murderer committed the crime sometime after 3:00 AM.</p>
<p>▲The Deceased Appeared to Be a Prostitute After the patrol officers finished inspecting the scene, they notified the Tongren Fuyuan Hall mortuary and ordered a coffin bearer to go there and take the body to the mortuary to await autopsy. At the time, a prostitute license photo was found in the deceased's pocket. The face was the same as the deceased's. The photo was signed Li Shuangfeng, 25 years old, and was issued on October 9th of this year. The Pingkang Tongshan Association has sent people to investigate the truth. As for the details of how she died, it remains to be confirmed.</p>

<p>▲Kidnapped by Bandits at the Train Station ▲Numerous Attempts to Find Him Have Been Unsuccessful</p>
<p>▲The Bandits Have Not Sent a Ransom Demand</p>
<p>Gu Zhenxiang, a native of Jiashan, Zhejiang, is 44 years old. He used to be a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly. In recent years, he has been engaged in the silk cocoon business. His financial situation is not affluent, but he is very generous and charitable. He has always had friendly relations with his friends and has never had any conflicts. He has a wife and children who depend on him for their livelihood. However, on the 27th day of the twelfth month of the lunar calendar last year, Gu left his hometown in the morning to catch the Shanghai-Hangzhou train due to business matters. He arrived in Shanghai at 12:00 noon. He immediately got off the train and walked out of the station, intending to hire a car to ride in. Unexpectedly, as soon as he left the iron gate, a car suddenly blocked his path, and three or four bandits jumped out, grabbed Gu, and shoved him into the car, which immediately sped away. At the time, a fellow villager of Gu's who was familiar with him saw this happen while traveling to Shanghai on the same train. After the fellow villager reported this to Gu's family, Gu's family came to Shanghai to find ways to investigate and reported the incident to various agencies, requesting their assistance in the investigation. Later, because there was no news, they published advertisements in various newspapers offering a reward for information. It is now learned that since Gu was kidnapped, his wife has been crying and his children have been weeping day and night, unable to stop. They are worried and anxious, and their situation is unbearably tragic. They thought that since he was kidnapped, there would be a ransom demand. Therefore, they stretched their necks and waited, day after day, but there was no news. It has been ten months, and there is still no news. Gu's family is still in a state of doubt, as they do not know whether Gu is alive or dead, and his wife is as anxious as ever. They sent someone to Shanghai again a few days ago, intending to find a way to investigate his whereabouts. However, after staying for several days, they could not find any information and had no way to start. That person took the train back to his hometown early yesterday morning.</p>

<p>▲Ten Rescued People Have Been Sent Back to Their Hometowns ▲Six Kidnapped People, Ransom Demanded: 150,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Industrial Special Police Team stationed at the mouth of the Wusong River outside of the Hai Fu Town intercepted a bandit ship at the port on the morning of the day before yesterday at approximately 8:00 AM. The bandits had already escaped in advance. The police rescued ten hostages from the ship's cabin, including Zhang Xiafeng and Cai Xuewei, both male and female. They had all been kidnapped from places such as Yangzhou and were being held for a large ransom. They had been held for more than twenty days. Fortunately, they were rescued this time. The hostages were overjoyed. The hostages were then escorted back to their respective hometowns. However, at approximately 3:00 PM that afternoon, a large group of sea bandits suddenly arrived in the Lu Hongzha area of Haimen and kidnapped the owners of a certain wood shop and pig shop, totaling six people. The bandit ship is currently anchored in the Xiasha port of Haimen County. The bandits are demanding a total ransom of 150,000 yuan and have openly sent bandits to negotiate with the families.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Attempted Extortion, Falsely Accused as a Communist Party Member <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>▲Yu Renbiao Had Evil Intentions ▲Jiang Chunkai Nearly Suffered Because of Him</p>
<p>Jiang Chunkai, a native of Tongzhou, lives in Shanghai and makes a living as a road worker. He resides at 36 Huade Road. A few days ago, his fellow villager Yu Renbiao and a Yu man named Ma Wenlin suddenly came to Jiang's house, claiming to be detectives in the police station. They accused Jiang of being a communist party member and of committing two cases of murder and robbery in Tongzhou and said they were here to arrest him. If he wanted to avoid arrest, he would have to pay 800 yuan, otherwise, they would not let him go. Jiang knew that Yu was known for extortion and was not moved at all, so they started arguing. Jiang's sister-in-law Zhao Sunshi came out to help Jiang, but they even wanted to beat her. They left in anger. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Ma Wenlin passed by Qiwupu Road and saw a Japanese detective from number 131 on patrol. He suddenly had an evil thought and reported to the detective that Jiang was a communist party member and asked him to arrest Jiang. The Japanese detective did not know the details and reported to the chief of police, who sent Chinese detectives Zhang Degong and others to arrest Jiang at his address. Jiang had not returned from work, and by the time Jiang returned, Yu Renbiao was following behind Jiang. The detectives arrested Jiang and Yu together and took them to the Yangshupu Police Station. After the chief of police inquired in detail, he realized that Jiang had been framed by Yu and Ma. Therefore, Jiang was released, and Yu was detained. The police were also ordered to arrest Ma. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Special Zone Local Court. Judge Feng Shide questioned them. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station, stated that Ma Wenlin used to be a patrol officer at the Yangshupu Police Station with number 760, but he was dismissed for dereliction of duty. However, he did not repent and continued to recruit disciples. Yu Renbiao is one of his disciples and specializes in extortion. He has committed many crimes, and the police have wanted to arrest him for a long time. However, since he has committed many crimes, they still need to investigate them one by one, so he requested a postponement. Then, Jiang Chunkai accused Yu of asking to borrow two yuan from him, but he refused, so he invited his teacher to make up stories and frame him. Zhao Sunshi also stated that she was beaten and injured in the head and waist and had not fully recovered. When Yu was questioned, he only admitted to borrowing money from Jiang, but he denied everything else. Ma Wenlin said that Jiang was a communist party member and had committed crimes in his hometown. Everything was said by Yu's friend. He knew the Japanese detective because he was a patrol officer and knew the Japanese detective at number 131, so he reported to the Japanese detective. After the Japanese detective recounted the incident, Judge Feng ordered Yu and Ma to be detained and postponed the hearing to investigate the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Trafficking a Large Quantity of Heroin on the Italian Ship "Illo" <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The American Evening Post reports that customs officials continued to inspect cargo from Shanghai carried by the Italian ship "Illo" from Krakow today. They discovered over 300 pounds of pure heroin. Based on the current price of 20 US dollars per ounce, it is worth more than 336,000 Mexican dollars. The ship's cargo has not yet been fully inspected, and further discoveries are expected. Today's seized items consist of 220 tins and 40 bags, all concealed within dried fruit and other goods. The weight of each tin varies slightly, while each bag weighs one kilogram, approximately 2.5 pounds. The quantity of heroin seized in recent days is so large that it is feared to be unprecedented in the 70-year history of the Jianghai Customs. Customs officials are now planning to thoroughly inspect all incoming ships for any suspicion of carrying narcotics.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Trial of the Zhao Assassination Case Underway <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>▲Xia Admits to Being One of Those Who Conspired to Kill Zhao</p>
<p>Shen Jinghua, the head of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, personally went to Hefei in Anhui Province and apprehended Xia Shaoen, a suspect in the assassination of Zhao Tieqiao, a commissioner of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. After several days of interrogation by the bureau, a confession has been obtained. Xia has admitted to being one of the conspirators in the Zhao assassination and to being present at the Bund. Whether he personally killed Zhao is still under investigation. It is reported that once the interrogation is complete, the case will be reported to the county and submitted to the province for review. Yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent personnel to retrieve Xia, but the transfer was not made as the interrogation is still ongoing.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Thorough Investigation of the Incident of a Japanese Guard Firing at Villagers at the Mitsui Coal Depot in Pudong <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>▲Having a Gun Doesn't Justify It ▲Luckily No One Was Hurt</p>
<p>The Mitsui Coal Depot in Yangjing, Pudong, built over 40 workshops during the May Thirtieth Movement to accommodate its workers. The workshops are separated from Caijiazhai village by only a Maqiao Stream. The villagers, numbering over 300 households, rely entirely on the water in this stream for drinking. Since the construction of the workshops, the workers have dug a trench next to the buildings, directly connecting to the stream, and all the dirty and unclean water is discharged into the stream through the ditch. The coal dust from the loading and unloading of coal at the depot is also discharged into the river, causing the clear water in the Maqiao Stream to become polluted. This not only hinders hygiene but also threatens the drinking water supply of the entire village. On the evening of the 8th, around 7 p.m., during a heavy rain, workers were again pouring polluted water into the river. Villagers from Caijiazhai came out to advise the workers to focus on hygiene, but the workers, relying on the power of the Japanese, refused to heed the advice, leading to a conflict. The Japanese guard of the Mitsui Coal Depot suddenly fired four shots at the villagers with a pistol. Fortunately, no one was injured. Cai Youxiang, the platoon leader of the 4th Platoon of the Caijiazhai Defense Corps, upon hearing the shots, immediately led the defense corps to investigate. It was then that he learned of the conflict between the villagers and the workers and that the Japanese guard had fired his pistol without authorization. Together with villager Huang Jiafu and others, they seized two of the unruly workers, one surnamed Zhang from Chongming and one surnamed He from Jiangbei, and took them to the Second Precinct of the Third District of the Public Security Bureau. Director Tang dispatched Patrol Officer Li to conduct an on-site investigation, and after understanding the situation, he met with Ishitaka, the Japanese manager of the coal depot. Ishitaka denied that the guard had fired the gun, claiming instead that the four shots were fired by the defense corps. He also issued a written statement to that effect. Director Tang has transferred the two workers and the Japanese manager's letter to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Upon learning of this incident, the Japanese Consulate sent personnel to the Public Security Bureau, initially attempting to deny the incident, claiming that the coal depot guard did not carry a gun. However, after the Public Security Bureau produced a letter from Ishitaka admitting that the guard had a gun but did not fire it, the Japanese had no further argument. It is reported that the Japanese Consulate has requested the Public Security Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation of the case. If it is confirmed that the guard fired the gun, the case can be handed over for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Two Barrels of Tung Oil Were Actually Opium Paste <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, around 8 a.m., Zhang Yushu, a patrol officer from the Second Squad of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol, was patrolling the Suzhou Creek near the Ponton Lane Bridge in the northern part of the city when he spotted a Xin Yong'an steamboat anchored there. He boarded the ship to conduct an inspection and found two asphalt barrels on deck, marked with the words "asphalt". As there was no one guarding them, he made inquiries but no one claimed ownership. He then inserted an iron skewer into the barrels and pulled it out, and suddenly smelled the scent of opium. Wondering why asphalt barrels would smell of opium, he became suspicious. He then devised a way to pry open the lids of the two barrels and carefully inspected the contents. They contained pure opium paste, estimated to be over 1,200 taels. He immediately took the evidence back to his squad and transferred it to the Nanshi Headquarters. After Director Xu inspected the items, he immediately prepared a document reporting the seizure of the two barrels of opium paste to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau released suicide statistics for September, stating that the number of suicide cases this month was 9 fewer than last month, totaling 173 cases. Among those who committed suicide due to marriage problems were aviator Wu Dehu and actress Mao Jianpei, both of whom took their own lives due to lack of freedom in marriage, which has attracted much social attention. Zhu Ruchao, representing the Zhejiang Provincial Bank, was robbed when he came to Shanghai last month to deliver funds, causing severe mental distress. He attempted suicide repeatedly, first by jumping into the Huangpu River, where he was rescued, and later by slitting his throat, a truly tragic situation.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Sandboat Robbed on the Qingkou Sea <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>▲Silver Dollars and Salted Pork Stolen ▲Many Crew Members Injured</p>
<p>The Beikou sandboat Jinde Yu sails to various ports in Dalian, Shandong, and specializes in carrying passengers and cargo back and forth. Last month, the ship left Shanghai and sailed to Dalian, carrying local cloth and other goods. After unloading the cargo in Dalian, it planned to carry soybean oil back to Shanghai. Because it had to wait for a specific date to load the cargo, the shipowner, Mr. Ling, thought that Shandong salted pork was being sold on the market and needed to be transported by boat, so he sailed to Qingkou, Shandong. He was hired by a merchant to load more than 800 salted pigs for transport to Shanghai. The ship departed from Qingkou, but when it sailed on the Qingkou sea, it suddenly encountered two pirate ships, with a large group of bandits driving them up and ordering the boat to stop. When the crew saw this, they wanted to turn the rudder and sail back to avoid danger, but they were spotted by the pirates, who opened fire on the Golden Ship. Two dockworkers and crew members were wounded by the bullets, and there were also more than a dozen holes in the bow. At this point, all the crew members were panic-stricken and had to run and hide in the cabin. At this time, two pirate ships had quickly sailed over, surrounded the boat from the left and right, and swarmed onto the ship, driving the people on board to the stern and watching them with guns. The pirates searched everywhere and found only a little more than two hundred dollars in a small leather suitcase, as well as more than ten account books, and cargo invoices and donation tickets from the merchants. The pirates were very angry that such a large ship only had such a small amount of money, and threw the leather suitcase and account books into the sea. Then they searched the crew's beds and took all the silver dollars they could find. Still not satisfied, they opened the cargo hold and forced the crew to start loading the salted pigs and move them to the pirate ships. When two crew members refused to move the goods, they were beaten in the face until they bled. All the salted pigs in the middle cabin were moved and stolen. As the pirate ships were leaving, they dragged two helmsmen to the pirate ships, intending to kidnap them and take them away. The two men begged on the ground, and were finally released. The two pirate ships then sailed east. The Gold Ship is now sailing to Liuhe to dock, and the injured crew members have been sent to the hospital, where one of the crew members is in critical condition. Yesterday, the shipowner came to Shanghai to report the information to the newspaper and various cargo numbers, but the ship needs to be repaired before it can sail, and the losses are very heavy.</p>

<p>▲Laundry Maid Injured</p>
<p>The Baohua Laundry, located at No. 20 Pishou Nalu in the French Concession, is owned by Zhou Abaob, a native of Ningbo. Yesterday at 11:30 PM, three robbers, all armed with handguns, arrived and threatened the owner, ransacking the place at will. However, the laundry had no valuables, only a dozen sets of customers' laundry, none of which were of much value. Frustrated, they demanded money from Zhou's wife, Liu, who replied that she had none. Enraged, the robbers fired a shot, hitting Liu in the right foot. The bullet exited, causing profuse bleeding. The gang fled in a panic. Police officers No. 356 from the Songshan Road police station arrived and took Liu to Renji Hospital. After treatment by the doctor, the police took her back to the police station to report the incident and investigate the suspects.</p>

<p>▲Over One Hundred Yuan Stolen on Avenue Edward VII</p>
<p>When the Xin Ning-Shao steamer of the Ning-Shao Company departs from Shanghai, the company sends a ticket seller to the ship. Each day, the ticket revenue is delivered to the company's accounting department after the ship departs. On the afternoon of the 14th of this month at 5:30 PM, after the Xin Ning-Shao steamer left port, more than one thousand yuan in ticket revenue, collected by staff member Xie Jinsheng, was divided into two leather bags. One bag contained over nine hundred yuan, and the other contained 184.8 yuan. Xie hired a rickshaw to go from the South City to Jiangxi Road. One bag was placed under him, concealed by his long coat, while the other bag was placed at his feet. When they arrived in front of the International Savings Society on Avenue Edward VII, two men suddenly appeared, brandishing handguns and warning Xie not to make a sound. One robber snatched a bag and fled. Fortunately, the stolen bag contained only the smaller sum of 180+ yuan; the bag with over nine hundred yuan was not taken. The company reported the incident to the police yesterday for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Police Request Withdrawal of Lawsuit Against Wang the Monk <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>▲Other Than the Same Name ▲Cannot Prove He Was a Kidnapper</p>
<p>Chen Qiwu, the son of Chen Bingqian, a comprador at Jardine Matheson, was kidnapped on April 4th last year. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of 100,000 yuan. He later escaped after one of the kidnappers went to check the ransom note and let him go. The police successively arrested several kidnappers, who were tried and convicted by the court. However, after being arrested, the kidnappers confessed that the handguns they used were supplied by Wang the Monk. The court issued an arrest warrant and ordered the police to arrest him and bring him to justice. A year has passed, and recently, the Huishi police station arrested Wang the Monk, a native of Ningbo, and sent him to the Special District Court. However, Wang the Monk absolutely denied any involvement in the kidnapping. The court then presented the case to the imprisoned kidnappers for verification, but they claimed that the handguns were handed over by A Feng, A Rong, and others. The judge ordered Wang to be detained pending the arrival of witnesses for further questioning. The police investigation revealed that A Rong and others had previously lived on Youheng Road, but fled without a trace at the end of last year due to unpaid rent. Furthermore, there was no evidence to prove that Wang the Monk was indeed a kidnapper. Yesterday morning, Wang was escorted to the Special Court, where the investigation results were reported. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that besides the defendant's name being the same as the wanted kidnapper, there was no other evidence against him. It is now proposed to withdraw the lawsuit. Judge Wu ordered that the case, which had been tried several times, be opened for debate immediately, and the verdict would be announced later. After the lawyers on both sides debated, the court ordered Wang the Monk to be detained pending sentencing on the morning of the 19th.</p>

<p>To the Editor, In the "Union News" column on the 14th, Proposal No. 1 in the 15th joint meeting minutes of our union reported that management's Wu Axiang hadn't fully paid Yao Xinzhu's cabin pay. Our union sent an investigator to verify, and it was confirmed that Wu Axiang had already fully paid the workers' wages. The previous case was a misunderstanding. This matter concerns the welfare of labor and management, and we ask your newspaper to publish this in the "Letters" column for correction. Thank you for your service. Sincerely, Shanghai Sand and Gravel Barging Union, November 15th.</p>
<p>To the Editor, After reading the article "Disputes in the Silk Factory Opening" in your newspaper, the description of Chen Zhongxiang's disruptions seems inaccurate. On the 14th, our union received a letter from the Yuanfeng branch requesting guidance for a temporary meeting of the branch. Our union appointed Chen Zhongxiang as the representative. However, the factory manager, Zhu Jing'an, disagreed with Chen's tone and pulled out a gun, ordering him not to speak. He also telegraphed the police station, and the police arrested Chen. All the employees of the factory witnessed this. They reported to the union in this way. Therefore, we request that you accurately report the details of this situation so that justice may be served. Sincerely, Shanghai Silk Factory Workers Union, East District Silk Factory, November 15th.</p>
<p>To the Editor, Please note that the "Road Construction Levy Regulations" have been published in various newspapers, but there is an error in Article 17. We are making the following corrections: "Article 17: If the tax is overdue for more than three years and is still not paid, the competent bureau of the municipal government may notify the landowner in writing 30 days in advance of a scheduled auction of all or part of the fixed property on the land to the extent necessary to offset the amount owed. Any remaining funds will be returned to the original delinquent taxpayer." We hope your newspaper will publish this correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Government Fifth Section.</p>

<p>▲Liyang and Jiangning Finance Bureau Chiefs Neglect Duties and Embezzle Funds ▲A Letter Requesting the Provincial Government to Punish</p>
<p>A letter from the Jiangsu Education Fee Management Office to the Provincial Government stated: "We are writing to inform you that the current educational funding situation in this province is extremely difficult. We have repeatedly ordered that the divided-up Mang Cao and Ya taxes from each county be used exclusively for educational purposes and not be diverted in the slightest. However, Pan Bin, the former director of the Liyang Finance Bureau, had a total outstanding balance of 27,924.285 yuan in silver from the collected and over-collected Mang Cao and Ya taxes as of August. Despite repeated reminders, he has not remitted the funds. For the September designated allocation of 1,486.88 yuan in silver, the director underreported the amount and falsely claimed that it was deposited in another account, failing to comply with the regulations. Gu Dingming, the resident supervisor, has reported the facts in detail. It is clear that the director is under arrest in the province for another case of corruption. If these outstanding educational funds are not thoroughly investigated and pursued, how can we deter others and ensure protection? In addition to sending separate letters, we are hereby requesting that Your Excellency investigate and instruct the Finance Department to handle this case together, imposing strict punishment and ordering the full payment of the outstanding special provincial education funds to protect public funds, without any leniency. Your public service will be greatly appreciated. Please reply to this letter. Jiangsu Provincial Government, Niu Yongjian."</p>
<p>Another letter to the Provincial Government stated: "We are writing to inform you that Huang Shoushan, the director of the Jiangning County Finance Bureau, has not paid attention to the allocation of funds from the land tax for provincial educational expenses since taking office. The former Cao rice and provincial taxes were special funds for education, but he did not remit a single cent. After the implementation of the new regulations, he arbitrarily shelved the orders and instructions from the departments and commissions, without reporting them. After repeated urgent telegrams, he began to report the collected amounts intermittently. As of August, the figures were checked and found to be discrepant and erroneous, and he also failed to report the amount collected from the first season of the year. It was only after our office instructed him to investigate in detail that he supplemented the report. According to the report from Supervisor Fang Jie, the names of the items delivered to the county granary have never been clear. Although we ordered a thorough investigation, we did not receive a clear reply, which, combined with the failure to report the amount of Cao rice collected, raises suspicions. Educational funding is urgently needed and has reached a critical point. The reported collection of special funds is overdue and has not been remitted despite repeated reminders. Such negligence of duty is inexcusable and has caused delays. He should be punished according to the law to maintain the essential needs. We are hereby requesting that Your Excellency investigate, and we earnestly hope that you will be mindful of the extreme difficulty of educational funding, provide strong support and protection, and promptly refer Director Huang Shoushan for disciplinary action and impose punishment to deter others. At the same time, please order a serious rectification in accordance with the regulations, and monthly clear remittances. The future of education is at stake. In addition to sending a letter to the Finance Department, we are writing to Jiangsu Provincial Government, Niu Yongjian."</p>

<h3 id="e162">Eighth District Party Headquarters' Second Public Telegram Regarding the Chung Kung School Disturbance <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>(Kuomintang News Agency) The Eighth District Party Headquarters of this city issued a second public telegram regarding the Chung Kung School disturbance, which reads as follows: Urgent, please forward this from Shanghai newspaper offices to all levels of Party Headquarters, organizations, groups, and schools nationwide for their attention. Ma Junwu, the former president of Wusong China Public School, shielded reactionaries and suppressed Party members. Our headquarters has listed the facts and issued the first public telegram on October 25th. It received responses from Party Headquarters in various locations. Knowing that he could not withstand public anger, Ma Junwu used a pretext to leave the school and resigned from the school board. The school board approved the resignation and appointed Yu Youren as his successor. Considering that Mr. Yu is a Central Committee member of our Party, a founder of the school with the longest history and closest ties, our headquarters issued a telegram on the 9th of this month to welcome him. However, the reactionary elements in the school have become even more rampant, forming illegal delegations, establishing armed pickets, coercing student will, and using the name of the whole body to express their oath to support Ma Junwu and forcefully reject Mr. Yu Youren's arrival. They tore down the banners of welcome to Mr. Yu from the First Branch of the Eighth District and the students of the school, violently beat Wang Guoping, a standing committee member of the First Branch of the Eighth District, and students Long Yingjie and Li Fanchou, and forcibly locked down the auditorium and classrooms, forcing students to boycott classes. Such illegal acts are extremely reactionary. Upon careful investigation, the reason why the reactionary elements in the school dare to act so rampantly is due to a few teachers in the school acting as accomplices. When Hu Shih was the principal of the school, he cultivated reactionary forces among the students for his own use and founded the New Moon magazine to publish reactionary opinions, which eventually led to his dismissal from society. Still ambitious, he strongly recommended Ma Junwu, whose political views were the same as his, as the principal. Since Ma Junwu arrived at the school, his various violations of the Party were not only following the old ways, but also intensified, leading to the increasingly rampant reactionary atmosphere. After Ma Junwu's departure, Hu Shih was greatly angered upon hearing the news after returning to Shanghai from the north, where he was unaware of the events. He immediately incited the reactionary students he had long nurtured to launch a movement to support Ma. Hu believes that with Ma gone and Yu coming, the reactionary forces he has painstakingly cultivated over the years will be wiped out, so he has no choice but to make a final struggle. On the 12th of this month, he dared to personally take over the duties of the chairman of the student union and incite students to expand the unrest. Hu Shih also told people that he did not cherish Mr. Ma, but because he had always opposed Kuomintang members coming to lead Chung Kung, he had to carry out his claim this time. Hu Shih is a down-and-out villain and a bored politician. Although he has been severely warned by the Central Government, he still does not know how to restrain himself. If he is not given due punishment, how can he deter reactionaries and prevent others from following suit. Furthermore, it has been found that Luo Longji, the head of the Department of Political Economy of the school, is an important member of the Statist faction. He and Zhang Yaoxian, the person in charge of the faction in Chung Kung, have been arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Later, Luo was bailed out by a powerful person and escaped the law. However, Luo still dares to hide near the school and direct various activities of the reactionaries. He should also be severely punished to punish the ringleaders. Furthermore, it has been found that Wang Hongshi, the chief of general affairs of the school, is Ma's personal friend and has been working very hard for this disturbance. All the actions of the delegation are presided over by Wang Hongshi. He personally attends and guides every meeting, uses school administration as protection for his rule, misappropriates student union fees for economic assistance, and personally hands over the keys to the delegation to lock down the classrooms and force students to boycott classes. We request the higher Party headquarters to severely punish all these reactionary leaders and reactionary elements in the school. Our headquarters, witnessing the chaos, cannot bear to sit idly by. In addition to submitting a request to the higher Party headquarters to severely punish the reactionary leaders and reactionary elements of the school, we also hope that all sectors will share the same hatred and jointly condemn them. We are infinitely hopeful and pray. This is our public telegram. Respectfully, the Executive Committee of the Eighth District of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Kuomintang, bowing respectfully.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Ninth Academic Lecture of the Vocational Education Society <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The academic lecture series of the China Vocational Education Society was held for the ninth time yesterday. Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and a standing committee member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, was invited as the lecturer. A very large number of people went to listen to the lecture from 4:00 PM onwards. Chairman Dang Weiyu introduced Pan's lecture, titled "The Most Modern Political Thought and the Three Principles of the People." His words were clear and concise, and he was well received by the audience.</p>
<h3 id="e164">China Vocational School Pays Attention to Leisure Education <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>▲Wang Yunwu Will Give a Lecture Tomorrow</p>
<p>China Vocational School recently has more than 800 students in the industrial and commercial departments. In addition to various specialized subjects, they usually pay special attention to leisure education. A leisure education committee has been organized to organize various extracurricular activities according to students' interests, such as sports, Kunqu opera, martial arts, magic, advertising, national music, Western music, speeches, harmonica, chess, photography, Peking opera, new drama, and touring groups. Experts from inside and outside the school are invited to provide guidance. Therefore, students spend their Sunday mornings engaged in extracurricular activities and do not have time to go out. In addition, experts and celebrities are invited to give lectures at the school. It is reported that at 8:00 AM on the 17th, Wang Yunwu will be invited to talk about scientific management methods. In addition to the students of the school, all young people registered or introduced by the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center are welcome to attend the lecture for general benefit.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Reply Letter from Li Liangong, Head of the Department and Professor of the Agricultural College of Labor University (Continued) <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>That Mr. Chen is opposed by the students of the Horticulture Department certainly has a complicated background. Otherwise, it would not have erupted so suddenly at this time. The coincidence is as such. As for the reason why the students of the Chemistry Department oppose Mr. Fang and Mr. Wu, it is because Mr. Chen made public to the students his private letters disagreeing with Mr. Tie Ming's coming to the school. The invitation of Mr. Tie is another matter. Mr. Chen has repeatedly expressed the same opposition to Mr. Fang and Mr. Wu. However, Mr. Chen is very scheming and has been plotting to harm his colleagues for more than a day. He used a lightning-fast method to publish private letters from a month ago at this time. Mr. Chen's maliciousness is truly questionable. From that day on, Mr. Fang, Mr. Wu, and Mr. Chen could not come to the school. And the magic tricks performed by Mr. Chen became more and more bizarre. In addition to openly spreading rumors to the students, such as "Greater Hunanism" and "Fang and Wu are giving up the deanship of the College of Science," there were also detectives and spies all over the college. Every move of the colleagues was monitored. The solemn and splendid university became a ghost realm of miasma and black smoke. Colleagues have been forced to be unable to exercise their professorial duties for three weeks now. Mr. Chen initially glossed over the situation, saying that the professors' suspension of classes was a leave of absence and that the news in the newspapers was a rumor created by the secretariat. Then, he adopted a strategy of breaking them down one by one, entrusting someone to mediate with Mr. Chen Guorong, but Fang and Wu believed that they had to leave. Mr. Fang's class has asked Mr. Jiang to replace him, and Mr. Wu's class has asked Mr. Tie to replace him. For the education community to have this kind of behavior cannot but be said to be a major stain on Mr. Chen's character. The above is about the content and process of the students' opposition to Mr. Chen, Mr. Fang, and Mr. Wu. (2) The letter states that the letter from colleagues to the students of the Agricultural College is full of slanders, but Mr. Chen did not list the facts or argue the key points of the slanders. For example, regarding the item of Principal Tie Ying, when the Ministry of Education issued an order last year to recruit students, the issue of the president of Labor University was not shaken. Mr. Chen said that the colleagues of Labor University unanimously wanted him to take the position of president and had entrusted someone to telegraph Chairman Chiang, but that person did not allow it. Mr. Chen also said that the colleagues planned to ask a certain mayor to serve as the president and that he himself would serve as the vice president and still ask that person to introduce him and introduce Mr. Chen to talk. Later, that person talked to that mayor about the Labor University issue and said that Mr. Wu Zhihui had come forward to mediate and that there was no shakeup in the matter of changing the president. Only then did that person realize that Mr. Chen's request was completely fabricated and laughed silently. Not long after, Mr. Chen wanted to support a certain gentleman as president and himself as vice president. All the colleagues of Labor University knew about it, and there should be more than hundreds of people who can prove it. (The names of a certain person, a certain mayor, and a certain gentleman are temporarily hidden because they involve too many people. If necessary, they can all testify.) Are these true facts also said by Mr. Chen to be rumors? At a time when the entire school unanimously did not accept the strange punishment of the Ministry of Education, Mr. Chen uniquely had a different heart and secretly campaigned to overthrow the highest administrative head of the school, with himself as the president or vice president. Is this not a conspiracy for power and harm to the school? As for the words of colluding with the Ministry of Education, it is a statement by the gentleman himself. The Ministry of Education is the highest educational administrative organ. How can there be "collusion"? Can Mr. Chen also point out where the basis for this kind of rumor comes from? Since Mr. Chen denies the organization of the school protection group, can Mr. Chen also point out the evidence that this kind of leaflet was fabricated by the opposition party? The smoke incident occurred at your residence on October 31. It was not until November 2 that some colleagues learned from Zhang's aunt that Mr. Chen said it was a frame-up and false accusation by colleagues. Then, the smoke incident that Mr. Chen committed when he served as a standing committee member and secretary of the preparatory committee of the 46th Army Special Party Department in August 1928, was also falsely accused by whom? And since there is a neighborhood number that can be pointed out, the name of the accuser can be easily inquired. The Public Security Bureau is a government agency and certainly will not make groundless claims. It is hoped that Mr. Chen will clearly answer this matter. As for Mr. Chen's sending anonymous threatening letters, saying that they were done by colleagues to falsely accuse colleagues, this is truly wishful thinking. Mr. Chen is truly smart! You must know that the opposition of colleagues to Mr. Chen is in a clear attitude and a proper method. On the one hand, we must take into account the dignity of the promotion of education. At the same time, we must maintain the personality of university professors. How can we follow Mr. Chen's example, use all base means to exclude dissidents. As for who is framing, falsely accusing, and anonymously threatening, since the Public Security Bureau has a case to investigate, Mr. Chen must clearly point it out to dispel doubts.

<p>▲Yesterday, they lost to Shi Guiya and Bode 3-2.</p>
<p>▲Today, Jiang Daozhang will decide the singles match against Taoshi.</p>
<p>The final of the French Chamber of Commerce's men's doubles championship on hard court tennis was held at 2:00 PM yesterday between the team of Li Huitang and Jiang Daozhang and the team of Shi Guiya and Bode. The two sides were evenly matched and difficult to distinguish. Therefore, the situation was quite tense. After five fierce sets, the winner was finally decided. As a result, the Jiang and Li team won the championship, defeating the Shi and Bu team with scores of 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, 3-6, and 6-4. The situation is described below:</p>
<p>▲In the first set, Shi and Bu won the first two games, and Jiang and Li won one game, then it became 3-1. Jiang and Li carefully fought back. After a long battle in the next game, Jiang and Li won back one game. After winning this game, Jiang and Li's momentum suddenly increased, adding two more games and taking the lead. It looked very easy, but Shi and Bu were not to be outdone, working hard to take three consecutive games, winning Jiang and Li with 6-4.</p>
<p>▲In the second set, Jiang and Li initially led 3-1, which looked very smooth, but the next three games were lost in succession, falling behind 3-4. Jiang and Li cautiously made their moves, often using high balls to return from the rear. When there was an opportunity, they would launch a strong attack. As expected, they succeeded, winning three consecutive games as they wished, also winning 6-4.</p>
<p>▲The situation in the third set was very tense, with each side following each other closely, without letting up. It was also the highlight, with each side giving a good performance. But Shi and Bu took the lead, and Jiang and Li followed closely behind. After 5-5, Jiang and Li jumped ahead, finishing in one go, winning two consecutive games, winning 7-5, and becoming a score of 2-1, with Jiang and Li taking the lead.</p>
<p>▲Jiang and Li were often in a dangerous situation in the fourth set and did not improve. After the score was 4-2 (Shi and Bu winning), Jiang and Li suddenly made a clever move, winning a lot of cheers. But the seventh game was still lost, which was a pity. Instead, the situation became more dangerous. It was impossible to turn the tide. Shi and Bu won with 6-3, making the score 2-2.</p>
<p>▲The key to the fifth set was in this final set. The two sides continued their efforts to fight to the death. Jiang and Li's close coordination and steady combat repeatedly took the upper hand. Although Shi and Bu tried hard to chase to 3-3, Jiang and Li won three consecutive games in the following games, winning again with 6-4, and winning the championship. Together with Lin and Qiu's winning the grass court doubles championship the day before, it added a lot of glory to the Chinese tennis world.</p>
<p>Also, at 2:00 PM today, Jiang Daozhang will play against Taoshi to decide the hard court singles tennis championship.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Jiangda Football Match, Guanghua Wins Against Zhonggong <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>▲A score of three to two.</p>
<p>The Jiangda Sports Association's football championship began yesterday. There were originally two groups. Because Zhenru from Jinan played against Western Sports yesterday, it was agreed to reschedule the game with Fudan. The game between Guanghua and Zhonggong was held at 3:00 PM yesterday at China Public School in Wusong. The competition between the two teams was extremely fierce. Each team scored two goals in the first half. Guanghua only scored one goal in the first half. As a result, Guanghua won with a score of 3-2.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Zhenru Overwhelms Western Sports <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The result was 2-0. The Western Sports goalkeeper was ejected.</p>
<p>The invincible Western Sports team was defeated by Zhenru with a score of 2-0 yesterday, which was unexpected. Since the team came out in the A group competition, it has won two games and drawn one game, and it implicitly holds the ambition to win the championship. It was unexpected that it would lose to Zhenru with a score of 0-2 yesterday. The future of the championship can be said to be in danger. The fatal injury of its defeat was due to the goalkeeper being ejected, and the injury and departure of the left back Wei Jinsheng and the left midfielder He Lei, which cut off the hope of recovery. Zhenru is indeed brave and good at fighting, but it is too wild, which is not appropriate. The referee was Graham, and the linesmen were Wu Yanzhang and Kelisha.</p>
<h3 id="e172">▲Zhenru Team Lineup <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>

<p>Not long after the start of the game, Zhenru took advantage of a free kick to attack the goal directly. Shi Gaotuo headed it out. Wei Jinsheng and Tou Na joined forces to advance and were blocked. Chen Jiaqiu attacked again, but it was still ineffective. The right winger Yake Lai suddenly had a very good cross. The left back Wei Jinsheng jumped up and headed the ball, falling to the ground and getting injured. After the ball crossed the goal line, Western Sports was repeatedly besieged by the enemy, and at ten minutes, Chen Bingxiang lost an excellent opportunity in front of the goal, unattended. In short, the Western Sports forwards were stronger, but the internal defense was not as good, so they were besieged by Zhenru for a while and could not extricate themselves, with danger everywhere, and finally the goalkeeper fell to the ground and hugged the ball, hoping to keep the goal, but Chen Bingxiang flew over and kicked his head, injuring the goalkeeper, who punched Zhuang Shihong, and was ejected by the referee. Afterwards, the actions of both sides were mostly crude, and penalties were repeatedly seen. Left inner Tou Na was transferred to inner guard, and inner guard Bo Shi was transferred to goalkeeper.</p>
<h3 id="e175">▲Shooting Towards the Clouds at an Empty Goal <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Zhenru, with eleven players against ten, still found it difficult to take full advantage. Western Sports worked hard on defense, making it difficult for anyone to cross the line. But later, the left back Wei Jinsheng was injured and left the field, and the attacking power was weak. Then the situation gradually became serious. At that time, Zhenru was carefree about the internal affairs and devoted all its efforts to attacking. Fortunately, the goalkeeper Bo Shi was quick and able to avert disaster. In the last five minutes, when the two sides were fighting each other in front of the Western Sports goal, Chen Bingxiang, in a free state and in a superior position, shot towards the clouds instead of attacking the empty goal. In the first half, there were no records.</p>
<h3 id="e176">▲Many Enemies, Few People, Scoring Two Goals in a Row <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Western Sports' strong forces pressed the border, repeatedly penetrating, and the barriers were broken one by one. Daweier advanced with the ball, and Liang Guanlian desperately resisted. Daweier missed the shot and flew over the goal. At that time, the audience was in suspense, fearing the disaster of losing the city. Unexpectedly, the result was like this, and the sigh was thunderous, rising in the east and responding in the west, and the joy was evident. Zhenru's fighting spirit was even more inspired. Chen Jiaqiu attacked in the middle, and Tou Na rose up to stop him. In the midst of the contest, the ball went to the left. Chen Bingxiang saw an opportunity and kicked it in, succeeding. Western Sports, with nine players against eleven, naturally could not take care of everything. Before long, Fu Heyi relied on his lively body to move freely in the enemy's formation and kicked the ball in, just in front of the goal. Chen Jiaqiu added a push, and it went into the net. Zhenru scored two goals in a row, less than ten minutes after the restart.</p>
<h3 id="e177">▲Losing Their True Colors, Improper Actions <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Western Sports was exhausted from running and struggling to fight back. Fortunately, they were physically strong and could barely cope. However, the athletes on both sides were mostly young people with vigorous energy and valued winning and losing. Therefore, they lost their true colors and often took actions that did not conform to the rules. Famous generals and heroes were either injured or ejected, and the spirit of competition was lost. At ten minutes, Western Sports' Yake Lai shot from the right, and the goalkeeper missed the ball. The ball touched the goal post. When it landed, Chen Zhenhe happened to be next to it and kicked it out, and it was safe. At that time, Zhenru was repeatedly unlucky. When Yang Baosen was attacking the goal and gaining momentum, he was suddenly knocked down and injured and left the field, and it took ten minutes to recover. At the same time, Mei Hongbao fouled and left the field, and Zhenru was fighting with ten people, and the situation gradually calmed down. At twenty-five minutes, Western Sports, like a trapped beast, broke in twice and almost scored. In the last five minutes, Western Sports seized the opportunity to break out of the encirclement and launched a major counterattack. Unfortunately, Tou Na was not flexible in turning and failed again. As a result, Zhenru defeated Western Sports with a score of 2-0.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Chinese Football Association Results Yesterday, Three One Wins Against Youth <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>▲A result of five to two.</p>
<p>▲Hua Ling defeated Dong Ya by a score of three to one.</p>
<p>The Three One team has a good reputation in the Chinese character group. The Youth team is still making its debut. Many of the players are Jiangwan athletes, but they were unable to field their entire army yesterday, which led to a reduction in strength. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the two teams clashed at the Chinese Baseball Stadium. The Youth team fought with nine players, but it was difficult to win against the enemy. However, the fighting spirit was not discouraged by the fragmentation of the lineup. After the exchange of fire, the Youth team took a deep breath and rushed straight to the enemy's goal, unstoppable. At ten minutes, center Zheng Liankun took the lead and made the first contribution. The Three One team, suffering this small setback, immediately sent a punitive force and stormed into the enemy's formation. Zhao Xuan made a brave contribution, creating a 1-1 tie. After that, near the end of the first half, Youth's Pan Hongzao scored another goal. Youth won the first half with a score of 2-1. When the second battle started, Youth finally suffered from a scattered lineup and a lack of support. Later, the Three One team scored four goals in a row. As a result, the Three One team won with a score of 5-2. Referee Jiang Xiangqing. Also, in the Chinese character group, Hua Ling and Dong Ya competed at the Chinese Baseball Stadium. The game started at 1:00 PM. Dong Ya scored a goal first, and Hua Ling then had two opportunities to score a penalty kick, but they failed to hit the target, which was a pity. However, they worked hard in the second half, and finally defeated Dong Ya with a score of 3-1.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Third Western Youth Basketball Championship <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>▲Starting tomorrow night at 7:00 PM</p>
<p>▲There are three games.</p>
<p>The third Western Youth Basketball Tournament will begin tomorrow night. There are fourteen teams in Group A and sixteen teams in Group B, many of which are returning teams from the previous tournament. There are also many newly added teams.</p>
<p>Among the new teams, the East China team has the greatest reputation. Many of the players are famous players from universities in the past, and Fudan University is one of the most outstanding. The Western Youth team has a large number of talents and is divided into Aipi and Erpi teams, with Shi Kuischi and Ta Fola serving as captains respectively. The above-mentioned newly organized teams are all worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Visitors enter from Baike Road. The price for the first night is five cents and three cents. The referees in this tournament will be convened by the director of the association's sports department, Toping, at 5:30 PM tomorrow for a meeting in his office. Ordinary games will be presided over by one referee. Important games will be assisted by one inspector. The program for the first night is as follows:</p>

<p>▲Two friendly matches last night▲Western Youth wins Qingguang▲43 to 26</p>
<p>Huzhong wins Huadong▲25 to 20</p>
<p>The Western Youth Association Basketball Tournament will begin tomorrow night. The heroes will compete for victory, and it will be another lively event. Last night, four teams had two friendly matches, all of which were outstanding, and the competition was quite fierce. It is worth recording as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e181">▲Western Youth Wins Qingguang <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>▲The Process of Winning</p>
<p>Western Youth's prestige last year is still in the minds of people. Those who played last night were still the old generals, only replacing Sullivan with Pi Lei. Therefore, the victory or defeat was already expected. After a few minutes of competition, Shi Guiya used his agility and lively arms to open the scoring. He is indeed a strong player in this field. Afterwards, the scores increased alternately. Western Youth was in the lead. After several ties, Qingguang resisted fiercely, but Western Youth still won the first half with a score of 24 to 17. After the change of sides, Smith, who was not noticed, suddenly rose up and scored again and again. Tan Daqi only threw in a few from a distance. Western Youth then won with a score of 43 to 26. The referee was the Westerner Feng Han.</p>
<p>▲The Reasons for Success and Failure</p>
<p>Shi Guiya, Smith, Ayer, and others in Western Youth are as good as they were last year, and their ball skills have long been established. What is even more admirable is that they prevented the enemy from having the chance to throw the ball. Pi Lei can defend and attack and is not inferior to Sullivan in the slightest. The Qingguang lineup was scattered, and there were sighs of nowhere to pass the basketball from time to time. It was difficult for Tan Daqi to support the mansion alone, and the defender seemed even weaker.</p>
<h3 id="e182">▲Shanghai Team Wins Against Huadong <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>▲Competition Description: The competition started with a change in tactics, becoming less intense than the previous game. Although Huadong had previously won against the High School Affiliated to Shanghai University, their star player Liang Guoquan was absent last night and replaced by Li Baojun. Consequently, the older team had to concede defeat to the younger one. Although Fu Wuqiao scored first for Huadong, Sun Baoqing, Dai Linzhen, and Qian Jingyong each scored a goal for Shanghai University, immediately taking the lead. Continuing their efforts, Shanghai University won the first half with a score of twelve to ten. In the second half, Shanghai University substituted Feng Nianhua, who scored a goal upon entering the field, demonstrating great energy. Huadong could not make any progress, and the final score was twenty-five to twenty, with the High School Affiliated to Shanghai University winning. The referee was Mr. Hui Tuomo.</p>
<p>▲Overall Assessment: The High School Affiliated to Shanghai University's team has a bright future. Forwards Dai Linzhen and Qian Jingyong have excellent coordination and are agile. Their ball skills are impressive. The other players also have many commendable qualities. It is no accident that they have won against their university team three times. In the future, the Shanghai University team will be formidable. Huadong, on the other hand, is mature and steady, and should not be considered weak.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the President visited Yangshu to watch a game between Huadong and the High School Affiliated to Shanghai University. Huadong won with a score of fifty-five to forty-six. In the first half, the High School Affiliated to Shanghai University scored twenty-four points, and Huadong scored nineteen points. Additionally, on Friday at 7 PM, they competed against the Qingguang Team, and the High School Affiliated to Shanghai University lost by a difference of five points, with a score of thirty to twenty-five. As a high school team competing against a first-class team in Shanghai, this achievement is commendable.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Trivial Records of the Anniversary of the Premier's Birth <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The twelfth of the month was the sixty-fifth anniversary of the birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Premier of the Chinese Nationalist Party. Various circles in this city held a commemorative meeting at the Republican Cinema on Minguo Road in the South City. The general situation has already been recorded in this newspaper. The following is a supplementary record of the trivial matters seen and heard on that day.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the meeting place, a white cloth banner with red characters was hung high, which read: "Shanghai Circles Celebrate the Sixty-Fifth Anniversary of the Birth of Premier Sun Yat-sen." The national flags were arranged in a crossed shape. I went before nine o'clock. The entrance was already crowded with viewers. Upon entering, I received a copy of the Premier's Birthday Commemorative Special Edition published by the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee and the Sixth Branch of the Third District. One section contains the works of Yang Qingyuan and others, comparing the birth of the Premier to a global alarm bell, saying that the sound of the bell affected not only one corner of China, or one place in East Asia, but the entire world. In addition to the texts of Wang Xiaolai and others, the other section also contained a photo of the Premier's childhood study place, titled "Cuiheng Temple School and Its Vicinity". There was a large tree in the photo, with curved branches, which was quite artistic. On that day, because there were so many guests who arrived, all the seats were occupied, so the meeting started on time. They were singing the Party song. Chairman Yang Qingyuan, wearing a blue silk robe, stated the purpose of the meeting, in addition to describing the Premier's birth in Cuiheng Village, Xiangshan County, Guangdong Province, he also raised two points in his life's work. (1) He invented the Three Principles of the People to save the dying China. (2) The revolutionary spirit was like a day for forty years, never giving up and fighting to the end. He hoped that those attending the meeting would continue the Premier's great spirit, follow the Three Principles of the People, and complete the Premier's legacy. While he was reporting, suddenly a person, about thirty years old, wearing a Zhongshan suit, holding several books, pushed through the crowd to the stage and bowed three times. The audience was puzzled. They later learned that he was late due to something, and he had not participated in the ceremony when the meeting started, so he made a special trip to pay his respects, which showed the depth of his belief in the Premier. Wu Bokang, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, also wore a blue robe. During his speech, he said that the Premier had a healthy spirit, so he was able to not be afraid of difficulties and fight with the environment. He hoped that all comrades would exercise their bodies and work hard. Chen Kecheng, a representative of the municipal government, wore a suit. He was very polite in his speech, saying that he had not prepared a speech for today's grand event, and he did not dare to disobey the chairman's order. He reported his scattered opinions to you, not a speech to you. Divided into three points (1) Cultivate personality. (2) Enrich intelligence. (3) Work hard on construction. A detailed explanation was given. Then Xu Ji, a representative of the Overseas Chinese Coordination Association, gave a speech. He described in detail that more than 30 years ago, when he was in Taiwan, he talked about the revolutionary process when he first met with the Premier. All the representatives present on that day were under the age of 30. What Xu Jun said was about things before they were born. It was as if the students in the school were listening to stories. They all listened attentively with great interest. The one who followed Xu Jun's speech was a certain overseas Chinese who had been forced to return to China by the Dutch government. He described in detail the various forms of abuse by the Dutch imperialism in collecting entry taxes from overseas Chinese, expelling Chinese teachers back to the country, opposing the Kuomintang, prohibiting the reading of the Three Principles of the People, and not allowing memorial weeks to be held, as well as closing the border for a long time during entry, and using body examinations as an excuse. He was even moved to tears. The entire audience had angry eyes and gritted teeth to express their indignation. A proposal was put forward on the spot to strongly protest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs against the unreasonable oppression of our overseas Chinese by the Dutch government in the Nanyang region. The Sino-Dutch treaty has expired, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be asked to immediately announce its abolition. When this proposal was passed, not only did everyone raise their hands unanimously, but they also shouted "Pass, pass!" A kind of passionate state was unprecedented in the meeting. It is enough to show that the people's hearts are not dead, and the country still has a future. I am returning and recording this to never forget.</p>

<p>— Mei</p>
<p>Ms. Shi Xi'en, head nurse of the Nanjing medical community, found 100 yuan in cash on Friday evening (November 7) in Jiaozhuangyuan Alley. On Tuesday (this month, 11th), she discovered that it had been left by Hang Hai, a specialist of the Ministry of Railways, and was official funds in his possession. After the owner stated the location of the loss, it was confirmed to be correct, and Hu Xuanming, director of the Health Department of the Ministry of Railways, issued a certificate. Li Handuo, a pastor of the Methodist Church, also issued a guarantee. Ms. Shi returned the money without taking any of it. This matter is worthy of being praised by the world, and it is especially rare for it to come from a woman. Therefore, it is recorded. (Rejecting a reward)</p>
<h3 id="e188">Examination of Male to Female Transformation <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Xiu Jun</p>
<p>I read in the newspaper of the 29th of last month about a 21-year-old man who suddenly transformed into a woman. I was surprised to no end. Who is this man? It is Shen Tianfang of Zhuji. Since the age of sixteen, he had abdominal pain and bloody stools every month. Doctors diagnosed him with venereal disease. Only Wang Jiren diagnosed him as a female pseudohermaphrodite. After performing a dissection and artificial vaginoplasty, he actually transformed into a woman. Alas, this is truly a strange story. I have always loved to be curious and have tried my best to collect information about strange events for reference. The details of this male-to-female transformation, including the surname, name, and origin, are clear and distinct. It cannot be compared to rumors that are passed down from the neighborhood and have no basis. Therefore, I have listed the following similar cases recorded in ancient books.</p>
<p>The Book of Han, Five Elements Records, says: "During the Jianping era, there was a man in Yuzhang who turned into a woman, married someone, and gave birth to a son." The Book of Later Han, Five Elements Records, says: "In the seventh year of Jian'an, there was a man in Yuejun who turned into a woman." At that time, Zhou Qun reported, "There was also this anomaly during the reign of Emperor Ai." Jiangnan History says: "During the time of the Later Lord of the Southern Tang Dynasty, Ouyang Zi of Luling was about to marry a woman when he suddenly turned into a woman. Later, she married and had children." The History of Ming, Five Elements Records, says: "In December of the second year of Longqing, Li Liangyu, a man from Jinglu, turned into a woman." The Outline of Love Stories says: "Two merchants in Luoyang were best friends. Suddenly, one of the younger ones had unbearable abdominal pain. His friend treated him, and fortunately, he did not die. After more than ten days, he transformed into a woman. The matter was reported to the officials. They reported it to the court. The two merchants were both unmarried, so they were ordered to be married as husband and wife. This happened in the Bingxu year of the Wanli era." The Nanyang Prefecture Records says: "In the third year of Tianqi, there was a man from Tang County who turned into a woman."</p>
<p>The above six items all clearly indicate the source, which is different from those who do not believe without evidence. However, the Jiangnan History records that Ouyang Zi of Luling transformed into a woman, which is slightly different from the one recorded in the Spring and Autumn of the Ten Kingdoms, which was Zeng. The History of Ming says that Li Liangyu's incident was in December of the second year of Longqing, while the Second Shen Manuscript says it was in May of the Wuchen year. The Compendium of Materia Medica also says that Li Liangyu had abdominal pain from time to time in January of the first year of Longqing, and the pain did not stop on February 9 of the second year. By April, the testicles had unknowingly shrunk into the abdomen and transformed into a woman's vagina. Menstruation also began the following month, and she began to change into women's clothing. The same Li incident, the month is not only two ways, why? I secretly think that these kinds of textual research are only for humor and strangeness, and have nothing to do with the main purpose. According to the example of writing, it is enough to have two theories coexisting.</p>
<h3 id="e189">A Few Words on Stomach Problems <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Yinliang</p>
<p>After the publication of my book "General Ideas on Stomach Problems", I was honored by the people of the country. The first edition of 3,000 copies had been sold out by more than half in less than ten days. From this, it can be seen that there are many people in the country who suffer from stomach problems, and their desire to seek treatment is sincere. How should doctors carefully study, understand the condition, and treat it?</p>
<p>According to reports from doctors in hospitals across the country, people with stomach problems are mostly from the intellectual class. Generally, those in the education, banking, and newspaper industries are most prone to stomach problems. This is due to the lack of exercise and excessive mental labor without rest. Therefore, the daily work and rest should be on time, and a certain amount of daily exercise is essential. Even a slight walk is enough to recuperate the spirit and boost physical strength. In the past, the great German philosopher Kant always took a walk once a day and enjoyed a high age. This is his proof.</p>
<p>When stomach problems first occur, you only need to eat less and rest quietly, and you can recover on your own without taking medicine. This is the principle of natural treatment. If you pay attention to your diet on the one hand and use medicine on the other, the disease will be easier to cure. Otherwise, if you only rely on the power of medicine without paying attention to your diet, it will not be easy to cure. If you are unfortunate enough to turn into a chronic disease, then treatment will be even more difficult.</p>
<p>Journalists are prone to stomach problems. This is because their duties mean that they cannot have a fixed place to eat and live. Busy banquets are also a major cause. After banquets, sitting at a desk and holding a pen is most harmful to the stomach. Therefore, journalists should rest a little after banquets, and it is better to eat less. And the host of the banquet should also treat reporters differently and never force them to eat. You must know that forcing people to eat more is to promote their illness.</p>
<p>After the treatment of stomach problems, the appetite will inevitably increase greatly. At this time, you should pay special attention to the hygiene of your diet. You should also strictly avoid small snacks. This is a natural phenomenon during recovery. Those who suffer from stomach problems must be careful.</p>
<p>The hygiene of the stomach and the methods of preventing stomach diseases, in thousands of words, are nothing more than two fixed words, namely, a fixed time and a fixed amount of food. Stomach problems are mostly caused by eating too much and being too full. Therefore, if you can follow this rule before you get sick, your stomach will not get sick. If you can follow this rule after you get sick, the disease will be easier to cure.</p>
<p>(Attached announcement: There are not many books left in the General Ideas on Stomach Problems. Please send a letter to my clinic at No. 589, Datong Road, Baik Road to request it. Please do so as soon as possible, or you may be too late.</p>

<p>There are still many places along the Burma-Yunnan border that grow poppies, so opium is produced here and sold to various countries. This item is difficult to prohibit. The price is too high. Everyone loves profit. The area where there are big profits, you cannot suppress them. Also, starting from Yunnan, there is no strict inspection of mountainous areas of various countries. Therefore, private exchanges and land routes have never been free. Also, there is no need for a passport. It is very difficult to prohibit it. Chinese people in Northern Burma, whether they are laborers or not, have a smoky complexion at a glance. It is also pitiful. As a result, another kind of superstition has been added, saying that those who work in mines cannot avoid miasma if they do not eat opium. I said, this must be a smoking rumor. Or superstition. In the past, many local bandits died in my hometown. Some people hated them and ate their hearts. As a result, the custom of eating human hearts has been formed. And they superstitiously believe that it can cure diseases. Each one costs four thousand five hundred. It is also a kind of superstition. What is even more ridiculous is that when I left Shaoguan fifteen or sixteen years ago, I went from Shaoguan to Nanxiong, and from Nanxiong to Dagan in Jiangxi. The sedan chair carriers had to eat opium. They were as black and thin as ghosts. I felt sorry for them and asked them, "Why do you eat opium?" Their answer was unbelievable. They said, "How can we carry the sedan chair if we don't eat opium?" I laughed heartily and could not explain it to them. They never understood that carrying the sedan chair was the result of eating opium. Instead, they mistook the cause for the effect, thinking that they could not carry the sedan chair without eating opium. Ridiculous things in the world are often like this. Now, people in Northern Burma are creating this kind of rumor, which is similar.</p>
<p>On the eighth, there was a Namtu train to Nabiao. I got on the train. The price was two shields. The price of the open-top car was half a shield. I met some Indians in the car and asked about Gandhi. They replied that he had been sent to the Bombay Prison by the British. I asked what we should call Gandhi. Can we call him Mr.? They replied that we Indians all call him Mahatma. That is, the meaning of the great hero. I asked, "Do you believe that Mahatma Gandhi can save you and get freedom?" They said, "Yes." I asked, "Does Gandhi believe in Islam?" They said, "No." I asked, "Is it Buddhism?" They said, "Close to it. But it is Hinduism." I said, "I always have a big doubt. Why do we in the East all believe in Buddhism, but your country does not believe in it and believes in Hinduism? What is the reason?" They replied, "Each has its advantages." I asked, "Do you believe in Gandhi more than our Sun Yat-sen?" They replied, "Sun Yat-sen is far inferior to Gandhi." I said, "Gandhi is lofty in philosophy and religion, while Sun Yat-sen is great in revolutionary work. Also, our revolution has now been 70 to 80% successful, while India is still early." They replied, "We don't have weapons." I said, "Indeed. We still need to work hard."</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Shedding Tears on All Sides, Sadness in Red Love, Wholeheartedness in Low Green Intent</p>
<p>Lin Fanzi said, "That's strange. Mr. Long has always asked for a play, but he doesn't take a promiscuous attitude. He can be called a loyal customer. Why did he also jump ship?" Long Ziyun said, "There is no ship jumping. This Green Intent is also a member of the Bao family. Yesterday, I had already asked for Bao Meiyun's concert. I knew that she had caught a cold recently. She had a fever and couldn't come out. A little girl came in her place. That little girl has another sign. Her name is Green Intent. They also took her down. Her face is not bad. She is also very quiet. Anyway, A-su always follows. Writing Meiyun, writing Green Intent, is the same in the end." It turned out that the Bao family in Puqing Lane was called the Bao Family Five Clouds. They have Bao Suyun, Bao Yayun, Bao Meiyun, etc. There are five Clouds in total. For example, after marrying a Bao Suyun, and then adding one, it is still called Bao Suyun. A guest, two festivals ago, asked for Bao Suyun. Suddenly he went out for half a year. When he returned to Shanghai and went to call for Bao Suyun again, Bao Suyun actually came, but it was already another person. It gives people the feeling that the name is there, but the person is not. They often innovate in this way. They pass it down from generation to generation. Therefore, they often use these names to promote and attract customers. Only the host remains unmoved. They call her the main family. The main family also has daughters. Some still teach them to sell their smiles and carry on their family business. Some say that they will no longer teach them to eat this bowl of food that breaks lives. Either they are sent to a girls' school on Sanma Road to study, or they are taught in a small room, not allowing them to come out to do business. At first, they say it is very good. They also know that opening a house is a sinful thing. It breaks the chastity of many good women and spoils the character of many good children. They think that after they have a little money, they will wash their hands and not do it anymore. But their environment makes them do it. His daughter will still eventually go down this road of prostitution. As the saying goes, "A dragon raises a dragon, a phoenix raises a phoenix, and a thief raises a son who digs holes in the wall." Scholars call it a scholar's family. Those who open a brothel can only be called a family that sells smiles. Therefore, the daughters and daughters-in-law of this kind of main family are often called small main families. Small main families are very good at their job. Because the ladies they take in and buy are always changing, only the small main family guards the main camp. They are in charge of everything there. The A-su that Long Ziyun is talking about is the daughter of the Bao family who opens the house. She is a small main family. She is only nineteen years old this year. She is tall and slender, with charming eyes and a smoky gait. She is the sweetest and most beautiful sister who accompanies the game. First of all, she is good at socializing. She speaks one kind of words to that kind of guest. Moreover, she is humorous and talks and laughs lively. She is truly a smart and clever person. If there is really an exam for a major in social studies in the world, in an era where there is no gender distinction, she would definitely be able to get a doctorate in social studies.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Financial and Gold Market Continue Declining Trend <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>▲Early Forward Settlement Bulls Adding Losses, Yesterday's Fifteenth Fixing Price Continued to Decline. Due to Saturday, the Gold Exchange Opened for Forward Settlements. Since the 16th fell on a Sunday and the market was closed, the forward settlement was held one day early. Business began at 8:30 AM. The December settling in January continued to see bulls adding losses, but transactions occurred before 8:00 AM. The initial loss was seven taels. Big bull operators like Yu Feng Yong added losses, totaling about thirty to forty bars. Afterwards, bears were unwilling to add more, and the price suddenly dropped to around four taels. At the 8:30 AM listing, it was five taels, then it further declined to three taels. It was observed that most fellow traders had already settled. For example, the Dalian gang bulls only had a little over one thousand bars. Yu Feng Yong, Cheng Feng Yong, Fu Chang, Zhen Chang Xiang, Yuan Cheng, and others were all bulls, while Da De Cheng, Heng Xing, Yuan Cheng Yong, and Tai Kang Run were bears. However, each firm still had a portion that had not been settled. The December session had no transactions as usual, and generally switched to the January session. From the early opening at 585 taels and eight mace, the noon closing was eighty taels and nine qian, a further drop of six taels and four qian compared to the previous day. All prices were transferred based on the January listing. In the afternoon, the listing was canceled as usual, but since it was the weekend, the market was closed.</p>
<p>▲Forward Settlement Completed, Inclined to Short Selling. Yesterday, the January session entered the market. Most fellow traders, bulls, and speculators believed that the forward settlement was completed and took the opportunity to increase supply promptly. As a result, the market continued to decline, and it briefly fell below eighty taels. However, trading was still acceptable. Heng Xing, Jiu Tai, Yuan Mao Yong, and others all had sell-offs, while the buyers were Shun Li, Yu Da, Wan Xing, and retail investors. By midday, there were five taels of fluctuations. The foreign exchange rate suddenly increased by half a notch, but there were no major changes, which was unexpected. From the morning, the gold price had two taels of rises and falls, hovering around eighty taels. By midday, the price only moved by two taels. The exchange rate was relatively stable, which was different from the gold price trend. The English gold available at the bank for the January session could absorb 174,375. With the gold price calculated at less than seventy-eight taels, there was a potential for future fluctuations, and the bears still had a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>▲Decline of the January Session. The January session opened at 8:30 AM at 580 taels and eight qian, with no changes in the major bars. Afterwards, there were slight buying interests, and the price rose to 81 taels and two qian. However, Zhi Feng Yong, Jiu Tai, Tong Tai Chang, and others had already sold off, resulting in a drop of two taels, to only 78 taels and eight qian. Subsequently, because the Dalian gang sold to Mitsui at 1.26 taels per tael for spot Dalian, and 1.25875 taels per tael for spot Toyo, and was also bought by arbitrageurs, the price quickly returned to the eighty tael level, at 80 taels and two qian. Afterwards, Heng Xing Sheng took the stage to sell, and the price suddenly plummeted by more than three taels, to 76 taels and 67 qian, which could settle the English gold at 174,375 for the January session. The price then rose by a few qian, to 7 taels and 34 qian. The initial offering was already long by 125, the US dollar was long by 2.5 jiao, and the Japanese yen fell by 75, causing the price to drop to 6 taels and a half. Yu Da, Bing Xing, and Heng Xing sold off. After a while, arbitrageurs and Da De Cheng and others entered the market, so the price rebounded by two taels, while the English gold was stable. Hua Bi Anda and Dong Ya Zheng Jin mutually traded 174,375 for the January session. At 9:45, the price was 78 taels and seven qian. The price then dropped by another tael, and after 10:00, it rose by another tael, hovering around 78 taels. The supply and demand on the surface were different. Later, the selling pressure was strong, and Anda also offered near-term English gold at 174,375. Hua Bank matched the March session at 17.5. At 10:30, the price was 7 taels and 23 qian. Afterwards, Tai Kang Run and retail investors bought in, immediately pulling the price up by one and a half taels, to 78 taels and 67 qian. Only a few minutes later, due to sell-offs by Yong Cheng Chang and others, the price at 11:00 was 6 taels and 56 qian. Yuan Heng and retail investors chased after it, and at 11:30, the price was 8 taels and 23 qian. However, Heng Xing, Chun Yuan, Yong Xu Chang, and speculators rushed to sell, and in ten minutes, the price suddenly depreciated. At 11:45, it fell to 76 taels and two qian, which was the lowest price of the day. Fortunately, the English gold was still stable. The bank bought the January session at 174,375. Liang Tian and other arbitrageurs came in, and the price surged by more than one tael. By the noon closing, the price was 577 taels and nine qian. Afterwards, there were continuous fluctuations of three to four qian, around 7 taels and a half. The maximum price for the half-day was 81 taels and two qian, and the minimum price was 76 taels and two qian, with a fluctuation of five taels.

<p>The cotton market was strong due to the large purchases of the current month. The distant months were also affected. The Ningbo gang and Shanghai gang made huge purchases, but the Japanese merchants and Han gang sold on the rise, also quite a lot. The spot cotton business in the market was deserted, and the factories were all closed. The selling price of Indian cotton was also low again. It was heard that the Japanese factories had made a large purchase.</p>
<p>▲Strong Buying Sentiment in Han Standard. The Han Standard opened in the early market, and the market atmosphere became tense due to the slight rise in US cotton. The squeeze rumors for the current month were also tight, and each month rose by one to two qian.

<p>The yarn market rose slightly. The overseas yarn market was still flat. The rise in raw cotton caused the yarn market to rise.

<p>▲People's Standard Good by Seven or Eight Qian. The People's Standard opened in the early market, and the market atmosphere rose slightly.

<h3 id="e201">US Cotton Slightly Improved Last Week <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The New York telegram reported on the cotton market for the week: The low government cotton production estimates for last Saturday caused the short covering to begin, and the market improved. However, due to the poor stock and grain market, the selling trend resumed. Afterwards, the industry bought stocks, which also improved slightly, and the shorts covered their positions again, so the overall trend stabilized. There was not much selling in the South. The cooperative association has a more stable statistical position for standard cotton fabric in January based on the spot goods produced by the (New York) generation, so the cotton factory's outlook is also bright. Generally, it is believed that the lowest peak of the market price has already been seen in the middle of last month, so everyone has the intention to stick to it. However, whether the price can stand firm after the rise depends on the development of transactions. The weekend statistics are attached below (unit: thousands of bales).</p>

<p>▲Zhabei. Yesterday, the arrival of goods from various gangs was scarce, and sales were active. The new special grade glutinous rice was slightly reduced, and the large plate saw an increase of about two jiao, opening high at 15 yuan and two or three jiao. The thin rice trend was set, and the price was the same as the previous day, still opening at 14 yuan and five or six jiao. The Yangxian Dujian market has been consistent and parallel, the arrival of goods is declining, the buying is smooth, and there are also guest sales inquiries, so they all rose by half a jiao. Special grade needs 13 yuan and one jiao. Because there are very few top goods in Duzi recently, the market is high and fashionable. The port tip trend is stable, retail is normal, and the appetite for Baiyuan hanging sales is still acceptable. The top change yuan opened at 15 yuan and three jiao, and the situation was not very good or bad.</p>
<p>▲Shanghai South. Yesterday, there were few arrivals at the river below, but there was still a bottom stock. The sales of various gangs were sluggish, and the Changbang top glutinous rice saw a fixed price, and the transaction did not start. The middle gate was particularly quiet, opening high at 14 yuan and six jiao. Su Tong Bai glutinous rice was also lacking in ups and downs, the sales appetite in urban and rural areas was limited, and the arrival of goods felt slightly reduced. The thin rice on the south road has a slight inflow and outflow. Although the surface has been set, the seller's shouts are tight, and the buyer's evaluation is different, so it turns into a fluctuating path. The top opened at 13 yuan and five jiao. There are still not many Yangxian goods, the sales are not lonely, and the price is often firm. There are relatively thick shipments of Dujian, so although there are retail stores inquiring, the market has always been only around 12 yuan. The transformation element is still in a dull pattern here, and the Yin Yuan transaction is very small. The</p>
<h3 id="e203">Flour Market Continues to Decline <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, all months showed a downward trend. The price of foreign wheat in Chicago fell by another four, five, or six cents, and in Canada by another one or twelve cents. As a result, most people's minds were unsettled. With food prices falling so dramatically, it seemed that the whole world was suffering the same pain. Although the situation in China was different, given the overall environment, it was beyond the ability of any one entity to prop up the market. Therefore, although manufacturers' sales were not very smooth, the market finally declined slightly. However, Fufeng Mill, because Australian wheat had been quoted as low as 4.345 taels, although it sold off a significant number of standards, after careful observation, a turnaround was still unlikely. In conclusion, the current month fell by 1 cent compared to the previous day, December, January, and March fell by 1.25 cents, February and April each fell by 1.5 cents, and May fell by 1.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Wheat Market Weakens Further <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market generally showed a weakening trend. Although foreign wheat prices continued to fall sharply, the bulls in the current month, with very little high-quality domestic wheat available, still wanted to hold on. The long-term bears were eager to try, but they were held back by the current month, so the decline was limited. However, the environment was still unfavorable. If there is a surplus of actual goods in the future, people's confidence may collapse. As a result, the current month fell by 1 cent compared to the previous day, December fell by 2 cents, January fell by 2 cents, February fell by 3 cents, March fell by 2 cents, and April fell by 1 cent. The spot market was completely stagnant because foreign wheat was gradually being imported by various factories, reducing the need. There were no transactions reported throughout the city.</p>
<h3 id="e205">North-South Goods Black Dates Market Trends Stable <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Recently, not many black dates have arrived. It is estimated that there are about 5,000 packages in stock on the market. Currently, sales are brisk for mid- and low-grade dates, while high-grade dates are not very active. However, land prices are trending stably. The Shanghai market has also stabilized. Yesterday's market prices were as follows: top-grade date heads, 18 taels; top Gao Zhuang, 13 taels; second Gao Zhuang, 11 taels; Gao Tong Shou, 10 taels; Zhong Tong Shou, 9 taels; and second-grade dates, 7.5 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Silk and Tea, Gongxi Tea Russian Sales Continue Briskly <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign merchant tea market, Russian Aid Society purchases of Gongxi green tea from Lailu Zhuang were still small. The city-wide transaction was over 1,500 boxes. Market prices did not rise or fall compared to the previous day. Judging from the current situation, there is hope that the Russian market will also open for top and middle-grade Zhenmei tea, as tea prices have fallen to the extreme, gradually meeting the needs of that market. In addition, needle-like eyebrow tea and pearl tea were also slightly purchased by British and French merchants. As for black tea, it remained sluggish, and it was feared that the inventory would be difficult to clear.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Hardware, English Steel Plate List Price Plummets <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The listed price of English steel plates was still relatively stable, but actual transactions were sluggish, so those holding the goods occasionally showed signs of anxiety. In recent days, overseas list prices have plummeted by three or four yuan, causing local standards to also trend downward. In addition, imports are increasing daily, and inventories are becoming more abundant, making it even harder to maintain standards. Currently, 2.5 li is only selling for 9.25 taels, half li for 6.75 taels, 7.5 li for 6.35 taels, 1 fen for 6 taels, and above 1.5 fen, because the arrivals are relatively fresh, can still be maintained at 6.25 taels. Although business in the Yangtze River and Tianjin areas is gradually developing, people's morale is low, and the market atmosphere is weak, resulting in a general sense of fatigue and listlessness in the trend.</p>
