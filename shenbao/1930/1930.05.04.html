<h3>演講注音符號</h3>
<p>創造注音者之歷史</p>
<p>以草鞋王媽作妙喻</p>
<p>與西文日字相比較</p>
<p>推行後之旣便且利</p>
<p>吳稚暉氏於五月一日在鎭江蘇省敎育廳演講注音符號原本始末妙語横生茲錄其演詞如左</p>
<p>注音字母符號本來没有什麽價値在智識階級的人看起來更是可笑不値一廢比之鞋履不過是一雙草鞋這草鞋不是在座大家穿的是要我們分配給人穿的此次全國敎育會議開得很好可算給了做大學生一項方帽子給了中學生一副象牙細磁的碗筷使他們都有飯可吃我們現在　要念及其餘二百兆人没有草鞋穿也得每人给他一雙草鞋一這草鞋就時注音符號</p>
<p>注音符號不是今天才有的在我們做小孩子的時候五六十年前外人在中國内地傳敎就有人用羅馬字母拼各地土話後來有王炳耀者在香港著中國式的注音符號推行數年未能普及在三十年前福建錫勇也做了一種符號他的兒子蔡璋就用他來做連寫之用同時有盧戇章亦用此法推行嗣蘇州人沈學在梁啟超時務報上發表一種十八筆的符號庚子後王照又以漢字偏旁爲字母如日本之片假名一樣用北京音來注字音推行得很廣後勞乃宣氏又加以修改籍端方力量傳播南方民國元年敎育部開國音統一會勞氏雖未參加議决字母大半相從而來無所謂創造無所謂發明當時會中接到外間送會字母外人有六七個中國人有二百餘個歸納起來也不過是半斤與八兩雖然是有分有合形式各有不同音理原則總是一樣的當時有人主張用羅馬字母者這是改造漢字了要知注音符號他的用處是帮智識低的人　字不是要廢去漢字另外來造一種新字假如照外國拼音别意那就高深了就是皮鞋了不是草鞋了再拿日本字母來談他那片假名更外粗淺不成個西他那個「Ｐ」是取阿字一半「不」是取伊字一半但陳字也從「Ｐ」伍字也從「　」陵伍絶對不能與阿伊同音不如我們中國用現成的「勺」「文」字的原體爲的當「勹」是「包」字「文」是「扑」字無論用到什麽地方都是讀「包扑」所以注音符號是以中國原料造中國草鞋不是新造或仿造一種新文字再推廣一句説就是這符號誰也不願出之誰人之手如同國歌一樣本來算不了一件難事但是把他看過重了就不容易成功什麽卿雲歌啦大道之行歌啦都未能確定弄得全國不能通行這就如同一個土地廟本來祇要二角錢就可以修理成功但是各鄉村　不肯讓一個村子去修甚而比於打官司閙個不開交末了老爺判斷大家不誰修派個地保費了二角錢立刻修成功了綢緞鞋子大英皮鞋是貴重的脚穿的他的鞋子在屋子裹有地毯保護他出去有汽車替他代勞其價値雖貴但那　抵得上草鞋能普通應用呢這不是孟子説的「道在邇而求諸遠」事在易而求諸難麽彷彿革命成功祇要實行三民主義有什麽過不去有什麽不共戴天説高興就要打仗不知道要打到什麽時候爲止這與土地廟祇要地保二角修理而鄉裹人偏要閙個不休豈不相同麽（未完）</p>

<h3>市敎育局</h3>
<p>注意收回租界敎育權</p>
<p>本五四運動精神</p>
<p>喚起全民衆努力</p>
<p>上海特别市敎育局長陳德徵氏感於敎育權不能統一其影響於民族生命甚大特决定自五月四日起努力於收回租界敎育權運動陳訓令本市各敎育機關敎育團體大中小各級學校一體遵照外特發宣言通告本市中外人士茲覓錄訓令與宣言如次其令文云爲令遂事本年五四紀念現又届期迴憶民八學生悲壯熟力之　國運動誠堪紀念迄今時逾十年一切建設因有障碍未能進行者即如本市租界敎育以事權尙未統一整理困難促進非易自十六年以來本局有收回租界敎育權之運動積極進行以期統一本市各校敎職員學生對於本市之租界敎育問題自必同在感念際此五四紀念甚望本市各級學校師生繼續十年前偉大精神專致力於統一本市敎育權運動使租界敎育早得收回整理而於抵制文化侵略工作上得一絶大效果爲此檢發宣言一紙令仰該校轉致敎職員學生一體遵照此令云云</p>
<h3>宣言全文</h3>
<p>凡中國人民無論爲本國過往的光榮爲民族生存的福利消極的必須打倒國際帝國主義而第一步即須取消不平等條約積極的關於百年大計的敎育更須反對文化侵略而第一步就是收回敎育權上海特别市租界敎育權之應由上海特别市敎育局主持管理此乃事實並非理論蓋所謂租界不過是允許外人居住營商的方地根本不是殖民地更不是割讓地上海的治　原未損失則上海的敎育權當然統屬於上海市敎育局必如是統一　劃則市内正當的敎育機關得已發展以敎育爲名的欺詐營利塲所得以取締學齡兒童和失學成年方各得受敎育的機會此爲上海華人所澈底認識迫切要求而以中外福利爲懐之居留外人或亦不能否認者也</p>
<p>所惜者因爲過往國人之欠注意上海自開埠以來租界内的敎育就聽從外人辦理馴至今日租界内數十萬市民竟陷於無敎育的不良環境中號稱全國最繁盛最開明的上海在國民政府治下的今日而有此污點而有此畸形現象這是何等痛心的事更是何等重大的問題上海特别市敎育局爲掌理全市敎育機關受市民付託之重負實施普及敎育之責特向國人及市民與租界當局爲懇切的表白與鄭重的警告</p>
<p>十六年秋本局爲公共租界華人敎育問題即會發表宣言當時實地調查除法租界無統計外公共租界公共學校只有四所就學兒童僅一一九一人敎育經費只占全市百分之一强而用於西童學校的年費銀三五二七五○兩華童學校只一五○四一○兩少一倍有奇和西人消耗於音樂隊之費相差無幾又查十九年工部局新預算西童學校四所經費三五七·九七○兩西人經辦之華童學校五所經費一七六·二四兩華人經辦的學校三所連行政經費三二·三五○兩以租界區域之大華童之衆·收科入取給於華人之多其敎育經費之分配之不平如此姑不論其實際辦得好壞如何單從敎育經費觀已足見租界當局對於納税華人之敎育之漠不關心</p>
<p>尤可痛者除此極少數學校外旣絶無社會敎育的可言而反多妨害社會的壞事除爲西人自已建立跑馬塲圖書館音樂會俱樂部等外對於華人非但積極的不予以敎育消極的連一切塲風敗俗的事也不加禁阻不良的刊物任其發行污濁的場所任其設立妓女乞丐任其存在以營利爲目的私立學校任其開辦一若非使居住租界内之數十萬老幼男女不瀹沉於罪惡之淵不止此是何等事而租界内僅有的幾校又都是敷衍門面其非將陷我華人於長此愚黯無能者即　行異族的文化侵略使華人永無認識我國固有道德與文化之機緣查遍不平等條約也無外人可以經營或管理租界内華人敎育之規定在國民政府治下我革命高潮的今日自更不容許其非法存在</p>
<p>我們深願租界當局立刻醒悟其過往的處置之不當自動的將租界内華人敎育權整個的歸還上海特别市敎育局由上海特别市敎育局秉承中國政府之意旨根據租界華人的需興辦市立學校管理私立學校籌設社會敎育使在租界的未會收回之前而租界華人之敎育能和市區同樣發展良好的風俗能同樣的養成</p>

<h3>日本棒球籃球之猛進</h3>
<p>棒球代表尙在劇烈竸爭軍</p>
<p>日本棒球準備委員原定目下竸賽中之春季六大學棒球聨會優勝隊代表出席遠東大會繼因戒　中菲實力之不弱且鑒於棒球之勝敗爲把握總錦標之最後關鍵故亟圖安全計議决准優勝隊監督（即敎練）有權選用老巧能手及參加聨會中之他校健將以期編成最善最强之全日本代表隊努力防戰積極保持棒球之錦標</p>
<p>東京六大學聨會參加者爲早稻田慶應明治法政立敎及帝國大學六隊每年春秋二次角逐錦標比賽用雙循環制今年春季賽於四月十二日開始上届遠東代表慶應軍不幸首遇勁敵明治大學初賽以十對九勝次賽以二對四受挫其决賽因秩序關係擬延至五月念日始克舉行惟昨秋聨會冠軍之早稻田隊則旗開順利連勝帝大及法政現在成績高居首位倘能打破圖覇心堅之明治則其錦標運命全賴最後與慶應之一戰有以定奪之早慶兩校具多年對抗之歷史其比賽也爲迷醉棒球者所齊注視人氣沸騰全國兩隊相逢則將實力强绵弱之念頭消却每以鬥志之盛衰及球運之佳拙而牛耳其勝敗結果不容預卜放據目下情勢敢謂早慶明將鼎足而立蓋其實力伯仲難分軒輊假使任何一隊奪得聨會冠軍選擇委員亦不忍輕視其他二隊之優秀選手致使良材有埋没不遇之怨茲探得斯界有力者之意見亦以爲混合三隊之能手編組成軍代表出席遠東較爲穩善之上策若如是斯誠爲我中菲之大不幸也</p>
<p>雖然上述三隊經過月餘之惡戰苦鬥則其隊員難免身體精神有疲倦弛緩之不利蓋聨會賽最踵開幕以數日之短促時間休養日隊員能否恢復元氣盡量發揮其本領實爲日本識者所杞憂而與我中菲可乘之機倘能團結合作運用策略毅然奮起與日軍决死一戰則未知鹿死誰手據日方情報本届菲列濱代表實力强勁非似前次學生隊之幼稚脆弱其基本隊之關税局選手均資格老練當具驚人之表演惟我國代表之檀香山華僑隊與近年日本各大學勁旅渡美途次邀戰時多失利此次不辭跋涉之勞復馳參爲祖國效力深望該隊員注意棒球隊合作之重要切勿陷溺個人之炫耀前届覆轍之戒尙在惟來者猶可追願我中華棒球代表共勉旃</p>
<h3>籃球代表業已訓練成軍</h3>
<p>日本出席遠東大會籃球隊自二月杪宣佈候補選手十八名後三月中旬會舉行合宿練習半月從事基本技能之訓練第二期合宿練習已於日昨開始每晚在東京第一中學球塲積極練習記者曾多次前往觀察茲就管見所及略記一二供我國選手之參考焉</p>
<p>據敎練某氏云此次日隊當選者要皆全國一流健將個人技能習已豋峯造極惟旣由各方選拔成軍則各選手從前所受之訓練難免門户各異故同宿練習時對於全隊合作技能之訓練均以基本敎練爲起點按步就班前進務使各隊員完全抛棄從前所習不同之技術而成一聲氣相同的新隊云</p>
<p>記者觀察所得日隊練習所對於新之五人攻守法最法意其爲主要戰法無疑退守時多用五人區域守衛制ＺＯＮＥＭＥＴＨＯＤＯＦＦＩＮＥＭＡＮＤEIENSEFTEE進攻時每以二衛留後任三鋒在</p>
<p>敵區内活動後衛二互相傳球以待進攻機會惟日人徧重於已獲得之球的保持非至前鋒有特優攻勢時决不任球離後衛手使敵人多奮球之可能此種戰法釀成徧於守而不進攻之弊又其前鋒進攻多利用敵區（指用五人退守法者五不管的自由射球線TOTYOWLINE一帶爲起點而少由兩旁前進其習用之進攻方式即由後衛在本隊前鋒占特别優勢時將球傳給在上項地域之一鋒該鋒遞傳給已進至籃下之另一鋒然後由其射籃換言之即由中央進攻兩傳而達籃也</p>
<p>日隊另一弱點爲由守而取攻勢或由攻而退守改變陣線之際多失於遲緩而行動紊亂吾隊如能注重此點在此煞那間用迅雷不及掩耳之技術長驅直入的進攻或勇猛的搜捕已入敵手之球可奏奇功</p>
<p>日隊不少長於遠射之隊員但非至空氣緊張萬分勝負難分之勝（多在下半時）不輕於試技遠射地點多在中線發球圈至旁線之中問而少在正中發球圈者</p>
<p>日隊候補選手黑澤威夫及川口正二氏日昨宣言因事離隊日人均認爲莫大之損失尤以黑澤之去爲最該氏係早稻田大學多年健將曾出席遠東大會抛籃之準確進攻之勇猛動作之活潑確爲日本第一流前鋒去</p>
<p>奮心苦練之日本遠東籃球代表於四月念七日下午在神田靑年會健身房邀約早稻田大學及立敎大學比賽初試身手大顯神威以迅速佳妙之傳遞幻變無窮之攻防陣形加以一致合作投射準確故兩賽連勝足示實力之不弱也比賽成績如左</p>
<p>雙方隊名上半下半共計</p>
<p>遠東代表二十一分三十五分五十六分早稻田大學十一分十三分二十四分遠東代表十分二十一分三十一分立敎大學七分十二分十九分</p>

<h3>中國籃球隊昨大勝匹剌堡</h3>
<p>結果六十六比十五</p>
<p>出席遠東運動會之吾籃球隊在滬訓練深見熱心　君守義不遺餘力以近來訓練之情形及技術之猛進不已本届遠東錦標深具把握最近屢約滬上西人隊作友誼比賽俾得正式之訓練而謀整個的工夫麥令司首先交鋒大敗而休昨晚原定美星隊比賽但美隊員因籃球季已過不願出馬乃由匹剌堡代替僅加入西靑指導史密斯一人且匹隊人員亦非超等角色然戰力尙稱不弱結果匹隊抱頭角　狼狽而回成績爲六十六比十五</p>
<p>昨晚之戰門票雖售洋一元然觀者並不以價昻而裹足待下午六時左右已見勞神父路上車馬絡繹人影相接爭先購票人塲待戰端觸發籃球房内人山人海充滿熱烈空氣當健兒進塲時掌聲陣陣而起表示仰慕藝術和崇拜英雄之意出席遠東會之吾國各項選手亦均蒞塲觀光最使人注者厥爲方於昨日下午抵滬之香港足球選手及女網球花李蘭女士千餘觀衆均離座而觀瞻仰風采此外如劉長春及哈爾濱女選手亦深爲觀者屬目不置榮哉運動員之到處受人歡迎也</p>
<p>中國隊於六點三十分鐘即出塲試身手見其身手之活潑與投籃球之神妙觀衆熱烈之采聲頻頻而起對於個個球員均表示熱烈之贊美當匹剌堡上塲時亦表示同樣之歡迎惟先前言明由美星隊出塲而今祗見黑衣白帽之水手匹剌堡對抗觀衆猶不無稍稍失望幸有史密斯加入聊能安慰</p>
<p>果然戰端觸發中國健兒互顯絶技猛力進撲如餓虎搶食聲勢可畏打得碧眼軍怒火衝冠大起抵敵頓時形勢緊張中國軍雖稱勇猛竟難越雷池敵壘難下相持多時紀錄不見加增中國隊由罰中兩分後由劉建常打中一球對方史密斯奮勇招架憑其個人力量盤球深入至籃下投入一球自此中國隊進至二十分時匹隊白克雪司加上三分雙方表演登峯造極匹隊雖非勁旅然毫不示弱戰力殊見充足中國隊表演之迅速與傳遞之神妙實可謂歎爲觀止矣上半時爲二十四對五</p>
<p>上半時中國隊用理想中之最佳陣線出塲下半時起除小唐以外餘四人均形調動形勢確並不稍减惟無上塲之緊凑耳努力交鋒中國隊分數徐徐上進而匹隊亦忽見稱手屢有建樹至餘八九分鐘時中國隊仍用理想中之陣線上陣聲勢大振加以助威之氣更激動健兒奮門之心祇見分數節節遞加靑雲直上小唐矯小玲　精悍善戰更爲全塲所稱贊　戰結果中國隊以六十六比十五勝裁判員張國勛檢察員舒鴻</p>
<p>中國隊之陣線當以唐堃·姚恩漢·劉建常王錫良·李國琛五人爲最佳動作之敏捷與傳遞之美妙眞使觀者目爲之花神爲之往此外如陸鍾恩·陳盛魁·王玉振·劉冠軍等亦有驚人之表演小唐更爲全國最出色者如老鼠一只出没無踪得分亦最多共計二十六分爲昨戰中之各個最高紀錄</p>

<h3>峨嵋輪擱淺與助救</h3>
<p>陽邏擱淺招商局之川江輪峨嵋號在滬大修以後至上星期二從上海載得棉紗一千五百八十八包運往重慶恢復川河營業該輪沿法西上在二號晨五時經過九江時尙發電報來滬謂途中平順即行離潯赴漢距至昨日下午一時該局又接得漢口來電言峨嵋輪於三號上午四時三十分船行至九江以上陽邏以下之五英里江面已擱入淺灘船身爲江底沙泥陷住不能行動矣</p>
<p>派輪拖救滬局得峨嵋擱淺電訊後立即由船務科拍發急電與漢口分局局長汪浩以該輪重儎擱淺自身已失行動能力速由漢口就近派利濟小輪帶工人一批至失事地助救如能拖出最佳否則即令載往工人將峨嵋各艙之貨卸上駁船先使船身浮起後再拖則較爲穩妥　　請艦保護峨嵋失事之地係屬土匪出没之區現當上游不靖而船内之貨價甚巨昨午滬局船務科長龍霞舉已發電至漢口海軍辦事處請王處長撥派軍艦一艘開往陽邏保護峨嵋及工作之拖救輪利濟等船以防盜刦矣</p>
<p>損傷情形在昨午二時許招商局又接到漢口二次發來之無綫電謂峨嵋擱淺以後業經船上機關長詳細檢視其船底如何刻下尙未得知而船内之汽管一根已經破裂特請滬局速向江南船塢記置後作速裝運前往以供需要云</p>
<h3>新豐輪在途撞損</h3>
<p>招商局之北洋班輪新豐號此次由天津南下在二號開離塘沽擬赴烟臺昨日午後五時許該輪發有無線電來滬謂船自津沽駛出至海河内發生與駁船互撞之事新豐之船頭部已受損傷現已開回自修云云來電甚簡駁船之損壞詳情並未提及故今次新豐來滬期又將阻遲若干時不能如期至申矣</p>
<h3>北洋日輪漲價</h3>
<p>日商大連汽船會社藉口金價日漲茲又議定從本月八日起將上海至天津一路船票價增漲計上海至天津頭等室原定七十元者今漲至八十元三等室原定十五元者今漲至十八元又上海至靑島頭等室原定三十八元者今漲至四十五元三等室原定十元者今漲至十二元云</p>

<p>卸職巡長</p>
<h3>六十萬圓大騙案</h3>
<p>厚息吸收鉅額存欵</p>
<p>稱貸者則重利盤剥</p>
<p>四年中得六十四萬</p>
<p>心懷水良僞稱被綁</p>
<p>避匿天津復又回滬</p>
<p>存户忍無可忍起訴</p>
<p>設兩公司天津人楊樹林前充閘北四區一分所巡長於民國十四年辭職後是年八月十五日在閘北共和路創設合興公司旋又就公共租界長沙路四千零八十九號續開文記公司該兩公司之營業範圍表面爲專做押欵及吸收存欵　　重利盤剥對於存欵者則誘以重利於是一般善權子母惟利是圖之輩多入其彀陸續以現金存入該兩公司而其貸出之欵遂亦重利盤剥月取息金多至五六分少須三四分不等向之稱貸者明知飲酖止渴因其對於貸户條件較正當金融機關寛鬆故雖納重利而不計</p>
<p>期票貼現除此兩類營業外兼營期票貼現之事如未到期支票持向該兩公司兑現彼可立給現欵惟取貼現之費甚鉅兑欵人以得現金週轉耗費稍多亦所不吝</p>
<p>六十四萬楊本此營業宗旨迄已四載有餘積至本年一月間吸收之存欵竟達六十四萬之巨存户不下數百人其手腕之靈動誠堪驚人</p>
<p>紛紛儲欵各存户中有名曹幼珊者爲瑞中旅館主曹之司賬某昔曾與楊共事楊乃利用某之交誼使向居停宣傳存欵利息之優厚曹惑於利除將本人之欵陸續存儲該兩公司外並勸親戚亦將欵存入共已積成三萬元</p>
<p>僞稱被綁本年一月十六日曹復徇楊之請又存入一千五百元楊乃一卸職巡長四五年間徒手而得六十餘萬遂起惡意突於一月十七日致函其所設之文記公司略謂渠遇綁票匪致遭綁票經與匪抵抗爲匪所傷幸得脱險已入某醫院治療云云</p>
<p>津沽來函該公司職員以爲楊眞個被綁受傷互相傳説事爲各存户所聞初亦無所表示迨隔許久大東旅館楊之友人忽接楊自津沽郵到一信展閲之下始悉前之所傳係楊故弄狡猾蓋楊於發出被綁受傷入院調治之函後即潛回原籍天津而匿居津地之三星公司矣</p>
<p>仍圖潛逃各存户旋亦得知乃推派代表赴津交涉着楊回滬理淸存欵楊祇得偕返與各存户磋商並同至葉茀康律師事務所會議其時各存户祇要求取還存欵而楊亦允償還故未决裂豈知楊所謂還欵完全係一種虚僞手段拖延時日伺有間隙仍再潛逃是以至今數百存户無一得其分毫</p>
<p>扭控跑街就中之曹幼珊存數較多對楊行動分外注意因悉彼日内將重行逃逸故於前日在北浙法路先將楊所雇之跑街江北人何其淸扭入匯司捕房經捕頭詰問一過轉送該管新閘捕房　　旅舍逮捕由何供出楊樹林現匿居虹口武昌路嶺南旅館二十一號房間當派華探目梁寳生·華探高晏融·及西探集克氏馳往將楊逮捕</p>
<p>旁聽者多昨晨解楊·何·兩人至特區地方法院由孫原推事升座第二法庭審理昨所起訴者尙祗曹幼珊一户曹由葉茀康律師代表控楊等狠侵占之罪何則延范　律師辯護其餘存户凡知楊被逮捕之人昨均到庭旁聽計有八九十人之多其不知此案已經發覺之存户當屬不少昨亦未到</p>
<p>改期再訊先經葉律師陳述此案經過情形後孫推事訊據楊樹林供公司係與謝姓合開資本爲兩萬元而文記當民國七年間即經開設始在五馬路嗣遷長沙路等語何其淸供我係十五年十月初六日受合興公司雇充跑街月薪初爲二十元後增至三十元等語孫推事即諭兩被告收押改期再訊</p>
<p>一大騙案滬埠近年來所發生之以商業機關欺騙之案首推三年前德人海龍道夫虚設海龍洋行騙取中外各銀行押匯欵項數逾百萬爲最鉅而本案被騙之數在六十萬以一允可謂海龍案後之第一大騙案矣</p>

<h3>好學不倦之女明星浪花</h3>
<p>國產影片在最近的二年内可算是極　　　沉悶的時代然而在這沉悶時代中產生了幾個富有藝術天才的女明星王飛娟女士也是其中之一伊在求學的時候對於電景很有濃厚的興趣在去年的秋天竟抛棄伊的母校考入錫藩影片公司爲基本演員伊的動作和表演頗得該公司導演胡宗理陳拙民兩君之重視伊第一次就扮演一個浪漫女子伊非但能用面部表演風騒同時能用内心表演這是最難能可貴的所以電影界中人都呌伊東方克萊拉寳目今武俠影片風行國内外伊又學習武術居然不到二個月</p>
<h3>南洋游記（二十三）</h3>
<p>一以人生命爲中心故不用國家主義滅國（愛國運動只三十年來事）二以全人類爲中心故不用一種滅他種四萬萬人種同化</p>
<p>三以活人爲中心故爲鬼神而戰爭的蠢事决不起（中國的神只是文人詩料女人遺悶耳）</p>
<p>四以肉體靈明人身爲中心故爲無情物質而犧牲之蠢事不起</p>
<p>五親親仁民而後愛物故埃及人拜牛拜貓印人拜蟲之俗不盛行</p>
<p>六以人同情良心爲中心故不重視覇道之法津</p>
<p>七以忠恕同此心同此理爲中心故不講平等而相去自不遠</p>
<p>再分析其由來中國古以堯舜爲敎後以三敎爲敎三敎儒釋道佛之觀音慈悲道家淸凈長生西人均評之爲無政府主義而孔之爲政以德無爲而治也是一半無政府主義故自古甚少暴虐之君此民族文化者欲行專制之共產必成爲沙灘上築七寳塔不問自然倒下彼威爾遜之十四條震動世界尙不出吾之興滅國繼絶世家常話有何奇者至堯舜讓即是佛之布施克氏之避爭乃大同公例也</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Naval Reduction Conference and Internal Affairs in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Although the London Naval Conference has achieved partial success, there is much opposition in various countries. Japan, because of its concessions to the United States and Britain, faces parliamentary questioning and criticism from certain military personnel, making it a weapon of attack against the government. In Britain, there is also opposition, believing that it is a mere sacrifice without any gain. Although opponents use national defense as a pretext for political maneuvering, it is clear that world public opinion has not yet fully agreed on military reduction. Among the three countries agreeing (Britain, America, Japan), two have been dissatisfied by their own people. Adding to this the failure of the European continental agreement and Italy's sudden surge in shipbuilding, a phenomenon outside the three countries, the effects of the three-country agreement can only be limited. From the perspective of the world's economic trends, military reduction is the most urgent task today. However, from the perspective of world public opinion and the current circumstances, it is extremely difficult to achieve practical results in military reduction. Human affairs have always been in this contradiction, struggling to prolong the years. The issue of military reduction and preparation for war cannot be an exception.</p>

<h3>The Political Friendship Association Raises a Ruckus in the Japanese Diet</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, dated the 3rd, states that yesterday in the budget committee, Yamazaki Tatsunosuke of the Seiyukai (Political Friendship Association) questioned Minister of the Army Ugaki regarding his management of affairs, demanding a written response from the Minister. This was seen as striking at a vulnerable point of the government, and attention was focused on how the Army would handle the situation, as there was a concern that it might escalate significantly. However, the Army remained opposed to the oversight. The Minister of the Army, who is currently recuperating, is worried about the situation in the Diet and plans to be discharged from the hospital within the next day or two. He will then rest quietly at his official residence and observe the proceedings of the Diet, or perhaps attend the sessions.</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, dated the 3rd, states that yesterday, during the budget committee meeting, after Yamazaki Tatsunosuke of the Seiyukai questioned the handling of Army affairs, Mr. Yamazaki further elaborated on the issue of civilian Ministers of the Army and Navy, engaging in a lengthy debate with Prime Minister Hamaguchi. Subsequently, Nagakawa Kanjishi of the Seiyukai took the floor to request that the government publicly announce the details of the investigation into Wakatsuki Reijiro. He argued that concealing the matter would only deepen public suspicion, thus pressuring Minister of Justice Watanabe. The Minister of Justice parried his questions. Then, Minister of the Interior Adachi rose to respond. As soon as the Interior Minister uttered the phrase "candidate with full powers," the opposition party erupted in anger, with everyone standing and shouting for Adachi to retract his statement, causing immediate chaos and a physical altercation. Order was only restored after the Interior Minister retracted his statement.</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, dated the 3rd, states that the House of Representatives' committee on increased compulsory education expenses convened yesterday at 10:00 AM. The government maintained a patient and conciliatory stance throughout the opposition's questioning, which continued for over a dozen hours, from 10:00 AM until 11:35 PM, when the session finally adjourned.</p>
<h3>The Malta Political-Religious Conflict</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London, dated the 2nd, states that discord arose last year between the government of Malta and the Church. The Catholic leader of Malta transferred a British priest to Sicily. Governor of Malta Strickland did not approve of this transfer because such transfers contain political implications. In April of this year, Irishman Robinson was ordered to investigate the difficulties by the Church, but that was not solved either. The Malta Catholics approached the Pope and then released an article saying that anyone who voted to support Governor Strickland and those who vote to elect the Constitutional Party would be committing unforgivable sins. As a result, the Constitutional Party, in view of the attitude of the Church, canceled all kinds of election meetings. The Nationalist Party is very active; the leader of the Nationalist Party is Mitze, who is against the Church. He advocates seceding from the British Empire and merging with Italy, and was subjected to military trial for this proposition during the European War. The Malta government has now reported the beginning and end of the matter to the British government, stating that Malta is a major outpost of the British Empire. If administrative staffing is under the command of the Church, then this outpost will not be safe.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Malta, dated the 3rd, states that important documents related to the political-religious conflict have been disclosed by newspapers. According to these documents, the British government was willing to negotiate a reconciliation with the Holy See, but the Holy See insisted on the dismissal of Governor Strickland, otherwise any proposal would not be accepted by the Holy See. The Holy See's attitude is resolute.</p>

<p>[H Third Page (Ten)</p>
<p>As a result, negotiations stalled. It should be noted that Strickland himself is a Catholic.</p>
<p>New York Police Chief Announces</p>
<h3>Third International Secret Documents</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the National News Agency, New York, dated the 2nd, states that New York Police Chief Whalen today released several secret documents of the Moscow Third International, detailing methods for American workers to engage in riots and strikes. According to Whalen, these documents were secretly smuggled into the United States from Soviet Russia. Several of them were written in code and secretly sent by the Soviet Embassy in Europe to the Third International's representative in the United States. Most of these documents were delivered secretly by a diplomatic courier to avoid customs inspection. It is argued that the Third International has no connection with Soviet Russia and should not enjoy the privilege of diplomatic correspondence; this act constitutes an abuse of diplomatic privileges. In addition, several seditious documents were addressed to a staff member of the Soviet government's Amtorg Trading Corporation in New York, containing instructions for a large-scale May Day demonstration and designating Amtorg's Seattle branch as the base for the May Day demonstration. These circulars also included an editorial from the Moscow Rava Gazette, written by American Communist leader Foster.</p>
<p>A dispatch from the National News Agency, Washington, dated the 2nd, states that Mr. Chicovsky, the director-general of the Soviet Information Bureau here, declared today that the secret seditious documents released by New York Police Chief Whalen were entirely fabricated by Russian royalist exiles to undermine the diplomatic relations between the Soviet government and various countries. He hopes that the U.S. government will conduct a thorough investigation into this matter. The Soviet government is open and selfless and will not fear the investigation. Once thoroughly investigated, it will be discovered that a group of Russian royalist exiles are forcibly conflating the Soviet government with the Third International in a conspiracy to incite the American public.</p>

Finance Minister Moldenhauer attended the meeting to explain several fundraising measures to make up for the budget deficit of 360 million marks and to schedule tax cuts for next year to compensate for this year's tax increases.</p>
<h3>Former British Sea Minister Criticizes the Treaty</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London, dated the 2nd, states that former First Lord of the Admiralty, Bridgeman, said in a speech in Weymouth today that the London Naval Conference had achieved very little in economic terms. Britain had given up an important part of its navy without receiving any compensation, he said in distress. The government had made great sacrifices against the advice of naval experts in the country. If this was necessary for economic benefit, then the government should have obtained compensation from some other country equal to the sacrifices made by the British.</p>
<h3>American Warship Construction Delayed</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the National News Agency, Washington, dated the 2nd, states that, according to today's news, the construction of three 10,000-ton cruisers in the United States is planned to be temporarily delayed to await the completion of new drawings. These new drawings are expected to take several months to complete.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Washington, dated the 2nd, states that according to the latest naval program, the United States should build the first batch of five cruisers, each of 10,000 tons and equipped with eight 8-inch guns. Two of these are already under construction, and President Hoover ordered the suspension of construction of the remaining three during the initial negotiations of the Naval Conference. According to the White House, the start of construction of these three large cruisers will be postponed further. This is not a result of the London Naval Conference, but because the design of the cruisers needs to be changed. It is said that based on the experience gained from testing the large cruisers, the authorities feel that the hull still needs to be improved.</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Criticize Italy's Warship Construction</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London, dated the 2nd, states that the news that Italy plans to build 42,000 tons of new warships this year has drawn criticism from the British press, which says that Italy's move is tantamount to asking France to increase its naval program and that a new round of naval arms race may begin.</p>
<h3>Typhoon in Northern Japan</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo, dated the 3rd, states that a typhoon struck Southern Sakhalin and northern Hokkaido last night, with about a hundred fishermen missing and feared drowned. Property damage is estimated to total 5 million yen. The dispatch continues, stating that 94 bodies of typhoon victims in Sakhalin have been recovered as of 3:00 PM today, and the whereabouts of another hundred people are unknown.</p>
<h3>NYK Line Reduces Dividends</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Osaka, dated the 3rd, states that the board of directors of Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) has decided to reduce the dividend to be paid from 8% to 5% due to a decline in business. This proposal will be voted on at the shareholders' meeting on May 30. Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK Lines) and other shipping companies will also reduce dividends.</p>
<h3>Rubber Production Restriction Plan</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Batavia, dated the 3rd, states that the Dutch Rubber Planters Association reports that a total of 111 Dutch, 313 British, 30 continental, and 58 Dutch East Indies rubber companies have joined the production restriction plan in the Dutch East Indies and elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Trusteeship of Territory Sovereignty Issues</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the National News Agency, Geneva, dated the 2nd, states that the International League of Nations Mandates Commission has again discussed the issue of sovereignty over the territory under the mandate of the South African Federation in Southwest Africa. The committee has always maintained that such sovereignty should belong to the International League of Nations, so this time it believes that if the South African Federation attempts to usurp sovereignty over the former German Southwest Africa, it would be violating this principle. It is now reported that the South African authorities have expressed their willingness to abide by the committee's decision.</p>
<h3>New Developments in the Zhongfang Labor Strike</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, dated the 3rd, states that, according to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, the details of the memorandum resolving the Zhongfang (Kanebo) Hyogo factory dispute are entirely in favor of the employees. Regarding the disposition of wartime allowances, 30% of the 70% will be incorporated into the base salary, and 70% of the remaining 40% will be paid by the Kanebo Welfare Enhancement Fund for a considerable period of time with equal allowances for male and female workers, and it is recognized that employees may elect a number of representatives to participate in the Welfare Enhancement Fund Management Committee. The company expressed regret for the dismissals and allowed them to be reinstated after an apology to the company. The company would also pay the dismissal allowance either in a lump sum or in monthly installments and would provide a separate loan equivalent to the allowance when they were allowed to return to work. In addition, the company would pay a certain amount of the expenses during the dispute. It can be said that the demands of the strikers have been largely accommodated. However, according to another source, there are insincere behaviors on the part of the company, such as forcibly sending female workers back to their hometowns, so there is an unstable atmosphere. The Kobe Federation of the Proletarian Labor Union, which assisted in the dispute, organized a surveillance team of ten people as a group, and forcibly regained the female workers who had been forced to return to their hometowns by the company, housing them in the house of Moriwaki Jinichi, a city councilor, and established a second front to continue negotiations in order to obtain the final victory. 1,500 hard-line female workers are entrenched in the factory. The union has secretly warned the female workers that no matter how the company uses violence, they must not return to their hometowns. The situation shows signs of reversal.</p>

<p>The Capital Holds</p>
<h3>May Third Tragedy Memorial</h3>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial service for the second anniversary of the Jinan Massacre at 6:00 AM on May 3rd in the Great Auditorium. Above the venue was a plaque that read "In Memory of the Unspeakable National Humiliation of the Jinan Massacre," with slogans on both sides reading "In Memory of the Massacre, We Must Vigorously Eliminate Traitors, Promote Political Tutelage, and Resist Foreign Insults. The Jinan Massacre Was an Act of Violence by Japanese Imperialism to Undermine Our National Revolution." Central Committee members Tan Yankai, Hu Hanmin, Gu Yingfen, Chen Guofu, Shao Yuanchong, Jiao Yitang, Chen Lifu, Enkebahtu, Keshinge, and representatives from various government agencies, totaling about 400 people, were in attendance. Chairman Tan Yankai presided. After the music played and salutations were made, the chairman delivered an opening speech, stating that on this day two years ago, Japanese soldiers committed various acts of brutality in Jinan, causing great humiliation to the Chinese nation. At that time, all armed comrades at the front were indignant. However, because the Northern Expedition was in full swing, they did not want to divert their forces and hinder the completion of the revolution, thus falling into the trap of Japanese imperialism. After careful consideration by comrades of the party, they would rather endure the pain temporarily to avoid unexpected sacrifices. Now that the massacre has passed, the traces of humiliation have not yet been erased. Today's commemoration of the massacre is not only about reporting the historical facts and issuing empty theories, nor is it about passively expressing revenge verbally. We must recall the pain suffered by our compatriots in Jinan two years ago, the difficulties faced by the generals at the front, and the impact on the country's status. We must all strive to strengthen the country and the nation to achieve the goals of independence and freedom, and fulfill the will of the Premier. Then the Jinan Massacre will not only deeply stimulate our nation and thus boost our spirit to cleanse the country of all humiliation. In the future, the commemoration can get full hope. Next, Hu Hanmin delivered a speech, stating that the Jinan Massacre was an act of violence perpetrated by Japanese imperialists against our compatriots using means that are most intolerable by international law and humanity. This is not just about the pain of a small number of people, but the common shame of the entire nation. When the author was in Paris, upon hearing Japan's deployment of troops to Shandong, he had told the press that this was the first step of the Japanese helping the Chinese warlords to block the success of the National Revolution and tried to bring about major negotiations to bring Shandong into its sphere of military force, at a minimum, to extend all its forces in China. It was by no means a matter of simply protecting its overseas Chinese. Furthermore, when Zhang Zongchang was entrenched in Shandong, Japan made no mention of protecting its overseas Chinese. However, when the National Revolutionary Army approached Shandong, it unexpectedly deployed troops to China. If this is not provocation, what is it? At that time, reporters from British and French newspapers still regarded it as protecting overseas Chinese, but reporters from German and American newspapers learned of the truth and cabled their home newspapers, saying that the Chinese revolutionary army was very civilized and that Japan's dispatch of troops to China was for other purposes. International public opinion has received a public fairness. In order to actively deploy troops at that time, the Tanaka Cabinet was a huge military official who wanted to replace the Wakatsuki Cabinet and prevent Foreign Minister Shidehara from overthrowing the Seiyukai. Therefore, it used its policy toward China as its slogan to interfere in China by force to maintain its position and because Fukuda was a disciple of the Japanese military official, who used to take the lead in his arrogance, so he was given the power to let him come to China to implement his conspiracy. Sure enough, on the afternoon of today two years ago, the Japanese sent a message reporting that the Japanese army and the Chinese army had clashed in Jinan. When I heard the news, I telegraphed the National Government to inquire about the truth, but because the telephone lines in various places were destroyed by them, the reply did not reach me until several days later, and I learned about the atrocities of the Japanese army, which was much more detailed than the Japanese telegram that concealed the facts and fabricated rumors. Although a report was made to the international community, British and French newspapers had already disclosed the news spread by the Japanese in front of them and were unwilling to republish the counter-evidence message. German and American newspapers all followed suit to prove that the previous news was not true. It can be seen from this that our country's propaganda power is weak. The Japanese embassies in various countries use non-factual information to spread it to newspapers in various places to confuse international vision. The impact on our country is not small. Therefore, I have repeatedly telegraphed the central government to discuss the observation of the Japanese in China that if the national revolution goes a step further, imperialism and warlords will have to take a step back. Its main purpose is to hinder the progress of the Northern Expedition so that the national revolution cannot succeed so as to extend the opportunity for imperialism and warlords to collude and use it. Be patient for a while to avoid harming the party and the country for a long time. However, the brutality of imperialists is actually mediated by warlords. To fundamentally resolve the issue, we must thoroughly eliminate the reactionary warlords. The issue of the Middle East Road is very important, and we should unanimously resist foreign insults, but Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan took advantage of this period to betray the central government and destroy unity, fearing that China would not be in chaos and willing to be a tool for the enemy. If the evil nature of this kind of warlords is not eliminated, there will never be peace in the country. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all compatriots in the country will make their greatest efforts to remove the obstacles to the revolution so that the traces of humiliation will be eliminated from now on and that the unique and unmatched consular jurisdiction will be abolished as soon as possible in order to consolidate the country's legal rights. All unequal treaties will not have a single word left in them, which is the fundamental way to avenge our humiliation. The ceremony ended and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Continued Important News</p>
<p>The Nanjing Special City Party Headquarters held a grand meeting at the headquarters hall at 9:00 am on May 3 to commemorate the second anniversary of the May 3rd Massacre, with representatives from various institutions and groups attending at four or five hundred people. The meeting was chaired by Shi Jishan, Executive Committee of the City Party Headquarters. After paying their respects, the chairman delivered an opening speech, stating that the May 3rd Massacre was caused by Japanese imperialists in order to preserve their illegitimate interests in China. Therefore, in commemorating the May 3rd, we should not forget this shame and strive to avenge it. On the one hand, we should work hard to strengthen the country internally and eliminate domestic reactionary forces, and on the other hand, we should continue economic sanctions against Japan and promote domestic goods. Only then can the humiliation be washed away, he said. Subsequently, Lai Lian, a member of the City Executive Committee, delivered a speech, stating that in order to wash away the humiliation of May 3rd, we must (1) concentrate under the guidance of the party and strive to complete the national revolution, and (2) unite and carry forward the Premier's spirit of love and sincerity and be determined to overthrow imperialism. Then, Zhou Wei, a representative from outside the party, delivered a speech, stating that when the May 3rd Massacre occurred, there were only a few thousand Japanese troops in Jinan. If we had resisted them with our army, we could have won, but because the internal traitors had not been eliminated, we had to endure it. Therefore, in commemorating May 3rd today, we should first overthrow the reactionary forces so that the imperialists will not dare to publicly insult us, he said. After the speech, they shouted slogans and dispersed.</p>
<p>In addition to the Central Party Headquarters and the Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters, which held memorial meetings on the morning of May 3, all government agencies and shops in the city flew flags at half-mast to express their condolences.</p>

<h3>Chen Jitang Returns to Guangdong from Wuzhou</h3>
<p>Negotiating Financial Issues with Rear Authorities for Days</p>
<p>Reports on Military Expenses Needed in Guangxi during Memorial Week</p>
<p>A Guangzhou dispatch reports that Chen Jitang went from Wuzhou to the front to meet with Zhu Shaoliang, and then immediately returned to Wuzhou. Yesterday, the 25th, he returned to Guangzhou with Chen Ce. It is said that this trip was to discuss and resolve issues with the rear authorities regarding the military expenses of the Eighth Route Army and special expenditures. He has been consulting and coordinating with Chen Mingshu at Tuisien Garden for days. On the 28th, he attended the joint Party, military, and political memorial week at the Provincial Party Headquarters, where he reported on Party affairs, public security, and the situation in the north. The following is a summary of his report on the allocation of military expenses during the Guangxi campaign: All units of the Eighth Route Army are determined by the Central Government and follow the Central organization, and cannot be increased or decreased. The Revolutionary Army is not like the army of the warlord era, where military expenses can be arbitrarily allocated. Before the implementation of disarmament last year, the Eighth Route Army's military expenses were fixed at 4.3 million yuan. After I took command of the Eighth Route Army, after the Baini battle, the troops were reduced, and the military expenses for June, July, and August were reduced from 4 million yuan to 3 million yuan. It was also decided to reduce it further to 2.5 million yuan starting in September, hoping to use the reduced funds for construction. Unexpectedly, as soon as September arrived, when I was about to spend 2.5 million yuan in military expenses, the Zhu-Mao communists suddenly disturbed Chaozhou and Meizhou, Zhang Fakui rebelled in Shashi, and Yu and Li of Guangxi province jointly plotted against Guangdong. The Eighth Route Army was divided into various directions for the sake of suppression, resulting in the fact that the originally planned 2.5 million yuan of military pay was not enough to be allocated. Subsequently, a telegram was sent to the Central Government requesting an increase of 300,000 yuan per month from September, bringing the total to 2.8 million yuan. October, November, and December were paid according to this amount. This year, the battlefield moved to Guangxi Province, and the war zone was wider than before. The original troops were not enough to be deployed, so an additional four training regiments were ordered to be added, with an additional 200,000 yuan per month for temporary expenses and 100,000 yuan for marching expenses. In February, because the enemy was still resisting stubbornly, it was ordered to change the original Class C organization of each division to Class B, with two regiments added to each division, including the original training regiments. The previously approved additional temporary expenses of 200,000 yuan were changed to 281,000 yuan. This is the actual situation of the Eighth Route Army's increase in troops and additional military expenses after the start of the war. As for the marching expenses during the war, 1 million yuan was received in October last year, 1.2 million yuan in November, and 1.4 million yuan per month from December to April of this year. Because the revolutionary army adheres to military discipline, all expenses such as hiring coolies, hiring boats, and purchasing defensive equipment are required, so marching expenses are mostly spent on this. Because the troops' operations have penetrated deep into the Xun Gui front line, the front line has been extended, and the market towns passed through have little supply. Even grass sandals must be purchased from the rear, and the total value of round-trip transportation is as much as double. Also, soldiers need a lot of straw for marching in winter, and recently the price of straw has risen to 1.2 yuan per 100 catties. Although this is a small matter, the amount of marching expenses required can be imagined. Now, marching expenses are increasing with the advancement of the troops, and it is feared that it will be difficult for the financial authorities to raise funds. Therefore, we have to transfer the rice subsidy in the army and clean it up after the war is over. As for the military equipment and clothing of the Eighth Route Army, they are purchased by themselves, and the cost is higher than that of other armies. In addition to the five divisions, the Eighth Route Army headquarters also has directly subordinate units such as the Air Force, Navy, military agencies at all levels, the Huangpu Military Academy, weapons manufacturing plants, the Army General Hospital, reserve hospitals, the Army Survey Bureau, the Army Survey School, the Guangnan Shipyard, the Wireless Electricity Administration, the Radio Station, the Radio Station, the Fortress Command, and the garrison commands in Chaozhou, Meizhou, Nanlu, Beilu, Huizhou, and other places responsible for the rear. The amount of various temporary expenses required above is not small. In addition, the cost of hiring ships, fuel, and coolies for the Xijiang campaign is also a major expenditure. Outsiders suddenly see such huge amounts of military pay and marching expenses, but in reality, every expenditure feels stretched. Those who have not experienced it do not know the hardship. After the report, Chen Mingshu gave a speech, saying that we express our deep sympathy for what Commander-in-Chief Chen has reported just now. Commander-in-Chief Chen is leading the troops to suppress the rebellion in Guangxi, and the monthly military expenses require more than 4 million yuan. Everyone can understand where this money is being used. Special expenditures during marching are absolutely necessary. We not only fully understand, but also will continue to actively help.

<h3>Yue Tongxing Ferry Sunk by Bandits</h3>
<p>Ambushed by Bandits with Water Mines on the Baihua Head River</p>
<p>A Tragic Incident of 130 Passengers Drowning</p>
<p>A Guangzhou dispatch reports that pirates in Guangdong province have been rampant recently, and travelers in various parts of the province are always wary. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 24th of this month, the local ferry traveling between Guangzhou and Zhongshan was bombed by bandits. It is said that hundreds of passengers either died in the water or were kidnapped and robbed. The Tongxing Ferry, which travels between Guangzhou and Zhongshan, belongs to the Shunli Company. It is usually heavily guarded, with many self-defense firearms and all kinds of anti-theft measures. Therefore, it has been quiet and uneventful. However, bandits have harbored resentment and are determined to rob the ferry. In recent days, the ferry has received dozens of extortion letters from the Chicken Hong Party and other gangs, all extorting money from the ferry and threatening it. The ferry, with its strong self-defense capabilities, ignored them. On the evening of the 24th of this month, at around 11 p.m., the ferry departed from Shiqi, Zhongshan, for Guangzhou. On this evening, there were approximately 320 passengers and crew members, and the goods carried were worth approximately ten thousand taels of gold. When it reached the Baihua Head River outside the port at 12:20 a.m., the helmsman steered the ship to break the waves. Because the riverbed was narrow and the two banks were only dozens of feet apart, and the reeds were as tall as people, the pirates were lurking here and placed water mines in the water. The ferry crew did not realize that the mines were placed under the ship, and they detonated the fuse to bomb the ferry. After a while, there was a loud explosion, and water splashed dozens of feet high. The Tongxing Ferry was immediately blown through with a large hole about four feet wide, and river water poured in. All the passengers were panicked and lost their color, and they scrambled to escape. Then the ship tilted and sank shortly after. Cries shook the sky. At this time, the Changshan tug, which towed the local ferry, urgently cut the cable and turned back, piercing the bottom of the ferry, allowing the trapped passengers to escape through the hole. A total of seventy or eighty passengers were rescued. At the same time, the bandit ships took advantage of the chaos and sent ships to rob the passengers. At this critical moment of life and death, thinking they were coming to rescue them, eighty or ninety passengers boarded the bandit ships. Little did they know that these unfortunate passengers who had escaped death by drowning were now to become hostages. At this time, there were no less than twenty bandit ships and small boats, fully loaded with hostages and property, which quickly disappeared into the distance. The rescued passengers then realized that their fellow passengers were all thieves, and they had to follow the thieves' orders and wait for ransom. On this night, the seventy or eighty people rescued by the Changshan tug were sent back to Shiqi, Zhongshan, and a telegram was sent to the province requesting that the Benevolent Society bring coffins to the scene of the incident to retrieve the corpses. According to statistics, no less than 120 to 130 passengers drowned in this incident, and 15 people were missing from the ship. The Convenient Hospital here reported that on the 26th, it prepared 150 coffins and dispatched dozens of staff and mechanics with two tugboats, which were towed by the Changshan tug to the scene of the accident to retrieve the corpses, sent them to Shiqi, numbered and photographed them for the identification of the deceased's relatives. (April 26, evening)</p>
<h3>Bandit Troubles in the Northwest District of Fuzhou</h3>
<p>No Less Than Forty Gangs, Large and Small</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The northwest districts of Minhou County, which is under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province, and Yongtai, Gutian, Minqing, Luoyuan, and Lianjiang counties are adjacent to each other, with overlapping mountains and ridges. It has always been known as a place with many bandits, especially this year. According to the investigation report of the Minhou County Security Corps Joint Association, there are no less than forty gangs of bandits in the northwest districts, ranging from more than one hundred to more than ten people each. The most fierce are the troops led by He Enniu, Zhang Benshou, Wu Daang, and Su Cun. The Western District is based in the Muyuan and Guanyuan areas, and the Northern District is based in the Dabe and Xiaobe areas. Wherever they go, they burn, rob, and kill, which is unbearable to witness. All the houses in Shaxi Township in the Northern District and Dahan Township in the Western District were burned without leaving a single beam. People fled and the fields were abandoned, with no hope of recovery. When Liu Heding's division arrived in the provincial capital at the end of last month, and the troop movements were not yet determined, each gang of bandits took advantage of the defensive emptiness and advanced to the Maan and Fengchi townships, several miles away from the city in the northwest, to extort money and kidnap people. People fled into the city in droves and dared not return home. After negotiations between the provincial government and Liu's division and two marine corps, it was decided that Liu's division would send teams to defend the northern district, and the marine corps would send teams to defend the western district, so that the bandit atmosphere near the city could be slightly calmed down. However, Dabe, Xiaobe, Muyuan, and Guanyuan are still in turmoil. Because the four districts are far from the province, the area is wide, and the mountains and forests are dense, it is useless to send troops to station in each important pass and serve as mutual support, and it is feared that they will be attacked. Therefore, there is no good solution. At this time of year, the people are afraid that the bandits will rob them of their grain, so they sell it all off cheaply. They are also afraid that the bandits will kidnap them, so they dare not go down to the fields to cultivate, and there is no hope of harvest. It has been found that these four districts have always been rice-producing areas, and the provincial capital relies on their supply for almost one-third of its annual food. Now, the people in the area will have no rice to eat in the summer, and the bandits are still levying military rations and robbing livestock. The provincial and county governments have recently received reports from farmers in each township that if they delay in planning for suppression, in another month or so, they will not only have no seeds to plant, but also no cattle to plow, and they will only be able to wait for death. The Minhou County Government has established a rural reform bureau, with County Chief Ouyang Ying as the director and Lin Baoteng, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, as the deputy director. He ordered the security corps of Dabe, Xiaobe, Muyuan, and Guanyuan districts to organize guerrilla teams and requested that Liu's division and the marine corps each designate a company of troops to be assigned to the rural reform bureau to cooperate with the guerrilla teams in combat, first to disperse the small gangs of bandits and then to deal with the large gangs of bandits. If this can be handled proactively, the farmers may still have a glimmer of hope. (April 28)</p>
<h3>Lu Diping Returns to Ganzhou from Hankou</h3>
<p>Communication from Nanchang on the 30th: Lu Diping, Chairman of the Ganzhou Provincial Government, went to Hankou a few days ago to pay respects to Chairman Chiang. The matter has been completed. On the 29th, he took the Chuyou warship from Hankou back to Ganzhou. He arrived in Xun that evening. On the morning of the 30th, he took a special train from Jiujiang on the Nanxun Railway to the province. At around 12:00 noon, the special train arrived at Niuhang Station, and he crossed the river by car and returned to the Provincial Government. The commissioners of the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government, as well as Staff Officer Lin of the Eighteenth Route Army, all went to the Provincial Government to pay their respects. The reporter also drove to pay his respects. Lu issued a statement saying that he had asked Chairman Chiang to send more troops to Ganzhou to suppress the bandits. Chiang said that the Central Government was currently suppressing Yan and Feng and could not send more troops to Ganzhou for the time being. Regarding the suppression of bandits, he had discussed joint operations with Chairman He Jian of Hunan Province, and a plan had been set. He also initiated a joint defense of the five provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Hubei. As for the finances of this province, the Central Government could not provide subsidies at this time, and the Provincial Government could not increase taxes. It could only economize on the one hand and reorganize existing income on the other.</p>
<p>Also, the communist bandits Zhu and Mao have withdrawn from Xinfeng along the Guangdong-Jiangxi border and fled east due to the joint suppression by Guangdong and Jiangxi. On the 15th of this month, they fled into Huichang County. The Jingwei Corps and the Merchants Corps of the First District of the county, numbering about several hundred, immediately went to Nanshan Ridge Banshan Temple, dozens of miles away from the city, to block them. On the 17th, the Zhu bandits led a part of their troops in three routes to attack the team. They engaged in a fierce battle for an hour. Because the disparity in strength was too great, they collapsed one after another. The bandits then captured the county seat of Huicheng that evening. Because of the massacre in Xinfeng, all the important people had fled to Ganzhou in advance, so they did not suffer. Recently, military sources said that most of the Zhu bandits had left Huichang and advanced to the Fujian-Guangdong border.</p>
<h3>Meeting on the Chinese Eastern Railway's Telecommunications Rights to Be Held</h3>
<p>Meeting Scheduled for May 2 with the Communications Commission</p>
<p>General Outline for Resolution Passed by the Board of Directors on the 26th</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch, 26th: This afternoon, the Board of Directors of the Chinese Eastern Railway discussed the issue of telecommunications rights and passed a general outline of eight items on the spot, which are as follows: (1) Before a new contract related to the Chinese Eastern Railway's telecommunications rights is formally signed, the telecommunications rights contract signed on November 22, 1922, shall be temporarily referred to for handling all matters. The Chinese and Russian telecommunications authorities must strictly abide by this contract. (2) After the new contract is established, the Chinese Eastern Railway Telegraph Bureau shall not accept or send commercial telegrams and all private telegrams at all Chinese telegraph offices in the Chinese Eastern Railway and along the line. (3) The Chinese telecommunications authorities may also provide long-distance telephones at stations along the Chinese Eastern Railway line for private use if they deem it necessary. (4) Telegrams sent from Dong Province to Russia or from Russia to Dong Province shall be sent and received in both Chinese and Russian. (5) If telegrams received and sent by the Chinese Telegraph Bureau need to be transferred through the Chinese Eastern Railway Telegraph Office, a handling fee may be charged at the lowest value stipulated in the contract. (6) Telegrams sent from Dong Province to Russia shall continue to be charged at the current price, that is, 22 gold kopecks per word for ordinary telegrams and 66 gold kopecks per word for express telegrams. (7) The Chinese Eastern Railway authorities shall supervise the implementation of the provisions in the contract related to the receipt and dispatch of commercial telegrams. (8) The telegram handling fee shall be settled once every three months. When the Board of Directors passed this case today, it also consulted the Railway Bureau and appointed Deputy Director Jiannisov, Director of the Telecommunications Department Merzlov, Deputy Director Shi Xuan, Engineer Kubakov, and Deputy Director of the General Accounting Office Gao Entao as members, and appointed Jiannisov as the chief representative to hold a meeting with the Communications Commission. The meeting date has been set for May 2, which will be convened in Harbin. The Communications Commission also appointed Li Deyan, Li Jinsong, Jiang Yi, Tan Xianqing, and Huang Junke as members, with Li Deyan as the chief member. The reason why this matter was brought to an end was that Li Deyan had returned to Liaoning a few days ago and reported in detail to the Northeast Communications Commission that if the matter was not resolved quickly before Mo left the country, it would be more harmful than beneficial if it was discussed at the Sino-Russian conference. It would be better to resolve it locally. All connection fees could be compensated for when the meeting was held to determine the details of increasing telegram rates and inspecting telecommunications. The Communications Commission allowed Li to return to Harbin on the 25th and inform Mo Dehui that evening. The meeting was then passed today. As for the electric properties along the Chinese Eastern Railway, such as long-distance telephones, according to Li Deyan, the Chinese side has no prejudice against this. If the Chinese Eastern Railway is willing to give way, China will pay for it. Otherwise, China is fully prepared and can vigorously build its own.</p>
<h3>Rice Crisis in Wan City Gradually Subsides</h3>
<p>All Rice Shops in the City Reopen</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Anqing, the rice crisis in Wan City has become more and more serious recently. All the rice shops in the city were forced to close on the 25th of last month due to forced purchases or robberies by citizens, which led to an invisible shutdown. Therefore, the People's Food Maintenance Association unloaded and intercepted more than 1,000 shi of rice exported from Congyang and sold it at a flat price in various districts, which was extremely crowded. A few days ago, the association decided to distribute 4 shi to each rice shop for sale after the eighth deliberation meeting, with a price of 1 jiao of silver dollars per sheng and 5 sheng per person, because it only had 800 shi of rice in storage. It also received a handwritten order from Cheng, the acting chairman of the provincial government, stating that all rice merchants in the city should open their doors and resume business, and the People's Food Maintenance Association would temporarily supply them. The military and police agencies are responsible for maintaining order. The association immediately followed this order, so all the rice shops in the city were receiving and selling rice on the morning of the 30th. There were police officers stationed in front of each rice shop to maintain order and returned to the bureau after the rice was sold out. According to the resolution of the tenth regular meeting of the People's Food Maintenance Association, the supervising staff ordered the rice shops to sprinkle water on the rice and hand it over to the customers after the rice was brushed to prevent hoarding and resale. Also, the provincial government convened a meeting of various agencies and groups due to the rice panic and decided to allocate 20,000 yuan from the provincial disaster relief association to raise 40,000 to 50,000 yuan together with the rice merchants to purchase a large amount of Siamese rice to Anhui for relief. They sold and transported it at the same time, and sent teams to protect the rice merchants. They first transported the rice that had been transported and not yet transported in the Gaobeibu area by car to the province for sale, and then continuously distributed the rice in the Wanyi Granary to the rice mills for milling and continued to sell it at a flat price. The provincial government has sent Jin Sheng and others with Ma Yi of the General Chamber of Commerce to Shanghai with money to purchase and transport rice. It seems that the rice shortage problem can be solved.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Quick News</h3>
<p>At 9:00 a.m. today, representatives from various agencies and groups held a May 1st Labor Day commemoration meeting at the Song and Dance Theater on Zhongshan Road, with a total of more than 300 people attending.

<p>When the military situation was urgent, the Anhui Provincial Government added a 5-cent military post-war donation to the export of rice in Wuhu, but it has not stopped so far. Yesterday, the General Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting and decided to telegraph the provincial government to request the immediate cancellation of the 5-cent rice surcharge in order to relieve the merchants' difficulties, because the Wuhu rice market was extremely depressed and the rice market was related to all industries.</p>
<p>In order to raise funds to purchase 10,000 shi of foreign rice due to the rice shortage, four flat-price rice bureaus were established. It was resolved to add 2 cents to the import and export of rice to compensate for the expenses. However, due to the opposition of the rice industry, the General Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting of various gangs again yesterday to discuss this matter and decided to add 2 cents to the rice, one cent for each of the buyer and seller, and the Jiang Guang rice industry persuaded the seller to pay, and the Guang Chao Yan Ning rice industry persuaded the buyer to pay.</p>
<p>A large gang of bandits in Guangde was suppressed by the Third Battalion sent by the Wuhu Garrison Regiment, and the bandits were surrounded by Zhejiang troops between Changxing on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui.

<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<h3>Groundbreaking Ceremony for Zhongshan Road in the Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>Since the capital of Jiangsu Province moved to Zhenjiang, all construction projects have been delayed due to the uncertainty of the competent authorities and the reorganization of the provincial government. The Department of Construction is now in charge of the construction of the provincial capital, and a construction office has been set up with Tang Ying as the director. The Zhongshan Road planned by the office, from the train station to Xiangshan, and the Zhongzheng Road, from the South Gate to the riverside, are about 20 li in total. Today, the groundbreaking ceremony was held at the Dashikou intersection of the two roads. Those who attended the meeting were Chairman Ye, members of the Provincial Party Department Zhang Yuanyang, He Yushu, Li Mingyang, and the two members of the Chamber of Commerce Hu Yu and others, and representatives of various agencies, 30 to 40 people. First, Zhang Zhu, secretary of the Department of Construction, delivered a speech on behalf of Director Sun, saying that the construction of Zhenjiang is needed not only more than that of foreign metropolises, but also more urgently than that of Jinan and Hangzhou. The construction must be accelerated. Tang Ying then reported that the road is 13 li long in total, and today's groundbreaking is for the third section. It will be started at the same time as Zhongzheng Road and can be completed in September. The road is 4 zhang wide for the carriageway and 1 zhang for the sidewalk. In addition, there is also a riverside road under planning, which will be built in advance to promote the business district. Ye Chucang then gave a speech. Someone said that the provincial government is building roads for officials to drive cars, but the road construction fee is currently 300,000 yuan for the first phase. The provincial government agencies are all dilapidated houses that have been converted. If everyone wants to live in good houses, they can use the road construction fee to build houses. This shows that we are not building roads for ourselves. In the past, when Guangdong first built roads, people were unwilling to demolish houses and petitioned the government not to demolish them. Three years after the roads were built, people saw the benefits, and places without roads instead asked the government to build roads. The government did not approve it because it had no money, so the citizens built the roads themselves. Today, the people of our provincial capital are not opposed to demolishing houses, but they are also unwilling. I hope that three years later, the citizens will not be able to ask for roads to be built and will build the roads themselves. He Yushu then spoke about the need for people to demolish houses from a broad perspective. Hu Jianchun hoped that officials and people would cooperate to open up the riverside road to promote the city and open up the suburban roads to connect the scenery, and hoped that those who benefit from demolishing houses would subsidize those who suffer too much from demolishing houses with conscience. Shi Liang'an asked the provincial government to sympathize with those who have no home to go to because of the demolition of houses. After speaking, he held a groundbreaking ceremony at the crossroads, took pictures, and dispersed.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Measures to Punish Smuggling of Grain. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, considering the daily increase in rice prices and the inevitable attempt by unscrupulous merchants to smuggle rice, specially proposed a conference to cancel the rice circulation passport within the province on the one hand and formulate measures to punish and reward the smuggling of rice out of the province. Any person in the border areas of Jiangsu Province and neighboring provinces and along the Yangtze River and coastal ports is permitted to report the interception of Jiangsu rice being smuggled out of the province or leaked into the sea to the local police and customs tax cards. If caught, all rice under fifty stones will be rewarded, and for fifty stones or more, five-tenths will be rewarded and five-tenths will be allocated to public welfare funds. For hundreds of stones, or thousands of stones, in addition to allocating one-quarter as a reward, the remainder will be allocated to local poverty alleviation or local public welfare projects. County naval and land police and tax cards that fail to handle the matter will be punished, in addition to the removal of the responsible officials, all other staff will be severely punished. If any transshipment company or rice merchant colludes with unscrupulous merchants to smuggle rice, once verified, they should be ordered to suspend operations immediately.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Borrow Money to Purchase Rice for Famine Relief. Last year's autumn harvest in the county was disappointing, and this year's wheat season was affected by continuous rain, causing rice prices to rise daily and making people's lives difficult. Local officials and gentry have repeatedly gathered to discuss borrowing money to purchase rice for relief, but no progress has been made for a long time. Yesterday (the 1st), County Magistrate Chen sent a letter to local gentry Wang Jingtong and Li Zhenqing, asking them to find a way to avoid famine and affect the market. It is said that Wang Jingtong is relying on convening various business meetings and is currently purchasing 10,000 stones of Saigon rice in Shanghai, and has prepaid 20,000 taels of ocean silver with the salt affairs and ordinary commercial firms to send staff to purchase and transport to Yangzhou to relieve the rice famine.</p>
<p>Financial Crisis Gradually Subsides. Since the Yongji Heng Salt Company went bankrupt, the financial community in Yangzhou has been affected, and three more money shops, Yufeng, Yuanhua, and Hualong, have successively closed down, almost shaking the entire county's money industry. Subsequently, the Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly maintained it, and Lu Xiaobo, chairman of the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, has consulted with Wang Jingtong, chairman of the Yangzhou Chamber of Commerce, in Zhenjiang. It is now heard that all the overdue debts owed to the various Zhenjiang shops will not be collected now, and Lu is seeking 200,000 yuan of working capital in Zhenjiang to stabilize the Yangzhou market. Therefore, in addition to the three companies that have already closed, the rest will not collapse again.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>

<p>Deadline for Temple Shai Payment. The issue of shai collection from the abolished Dongyue Temple. Fang Yintou, Qi Meibingkui, Chen Ruiting, Zhang Zhaolin, Zhong Manting, Du Xilin, and other temple chiefs, had a lawsuit with the directors of Tongming Elementary School. After years of litigation, it was resolved in the autumn of last year. Subsequently, representatives of various legal groups and members of the standing committee of the Educational Endowment Association, with Guan Zhixun representing, stated that the Dongyue Temple was an abolished temple and that its property belonged to the entire county. Based on the Regulations on the Supervision of Temples, they applied to have it transferred to the County Public Funds and Public Property Committee for management. The county government approved the request and ordered the temple chiefs to submit the Shai collection books and send a copy to the Endowment Committee. The committee determined that the Shai collection methods and timing were inconsistent with the old rules and, on the 20th, resolved that all temple property of Dongyue Temple (estimated at over one hundred mu) should pay Shai according to the 17th year's price of over seven yuan per mu and set a deadline for payment to the committee by the end of April.

<h3>Explanation of Methods for Prioritizing and Supplementing Geng Funds</h3>
<p>The Supervisor's Office for Students Studying in Japan requested an explanation of the difficult points in prioritizing and supplementing Geng funds. The Ministry of Education has issued instructions as follows: (1) Female undergraduate students and male undergraduate students should not be prioritized based on differences in name and admission examination methods when supplementing funds. (2) The question of whether research students admitted to undergraduate programs can continue to receive funding has been telegraphed separately. (3) For newly established provinces, in addition to Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, which have already been allocated three spots from the central Geng funds, Ningxia and Xikang provinces can each be given one spot when the central Geng funds become vacant in the future. Provinces with their own Geng funds cannot borrow from the vacant spots in other provinces.</p>

<h3>Pronunciation Symbols Lecture</h3>
<p>History of the Creators of Pronunciation</p>
<p>A Wonderful Analogy Using Straw Sandals and Mother Wang</p>
<p>Comparison with Western and Japanese Characters</p>
<p>Convenience and Benefits After Implementation</p>
<p>On May 1st, Mr. Wu Zhihui gave a lecture at the Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education on the origin and end of pronunciation symbols, with witty remarks. The following is a record of his speech:</p>
<p>Pronunciation alphabet symbols originally have no value. To people in the intellectual class, they seem laughable and worthless. Compared to footwear, they are nothing more than a pair of straw sandals. These straw sandals are not for everyone present to wear, but for us to distribute to others. This National Education Conference is well held, and can be considered to have given university students a square hat and middle school students a pair of ivory fine porcelain bowls and chopsticks, so that they all have food to eat. We now have to think about the remaining 200 million people who don't have straw sandals to wear and have to give each of them a pair of straw sandals. These straw sandals are the pronunciation symbols.</p>
<p>Pronunciation symbols are not new today. When we were children, fifty or sixty years ago, foreigners who preached in the Chinese mainland used Roman letters to spell local dialects. Later, Wang Bingyao wrote Chinese-style pronunciation symbols in Hong Kong and promoted them for several years, but they failed to become popular. Thirty years ago, Xi Yong in Fujian also made a kind of symbol, and his son Cai Zhang used it for cursive writing. At the same time, Lu Zhang also used this method to promote it. Later, Shen Xue, a native of Suzhou, published a kind of eighteen-stroke symbol in Liang Qichao's Shiwu Bao. After the Gengzi year, Wang Zhao used the radicals of Chinese characters as letters, like Japanese katakana, to annotate the pronunciation of words in Beijing dialect, which was widely promoted. Later, Mr. Lao Naixuan modified it and spread it to the south with the power of Duanfang. In the first year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education held a national phonetic unification conference. Although Mr. Lao did not participate, most of the letters decided came from him. There was no so-called creation or invention. At that time, the meeting received letters sent from outside. There were six or seven foreigners and more than two hundred Chinese. In summary, they were only half a catty and eight taels. Although there were divisions and combinations, and the forms were different, the phonetic principles were always the same. At that time, some people advocated using Roman letters. This was transforming Chinese characters. It must be known that the use of pronunciation symbols is to help people with low intelligence recognize characters, not to abolish Chinese characters and create a new kind of characters. If we follow foreign phonetic spelling, it would be profound. It would be leather shoes, not straw sandals. Let's talk about Japanese letters. Their katakana is even more superficial and incomplete. Their "P" is taken from half of the character "A", and "Bu" is taken from half of the character "I". However, the character "Chen" also comes from "P", and the character "Wu" also comes from "". Ling Wu absolutely cannot have the same sound as A and I. It is better for us Chinese to use the original form of the existing characters "Shao" and "Wen". The "勹" is the character "Bao", and "Wen" is the character "Pu". No matter where it is used, it is read "Bao Pu". Therefore, pronunciation symbols are made of Chinese raw materials to make Chinese straw sandals, not newly created or imitated as a new kind of writing. To put it more broadly, it means that no one wants to produce these symbols from their own hands, just like the national anthem. It was originally not a difficult thing, but if you take it too seriously, it will not be easy to succeed. The Qingyun Song and the Dadao Zhixing Song have not been determined, making it impossible for the whole country to pass it. This is like a land temple that can be repaired successfully for only two jiao, but the villages are unwilling to let one village repair it, even to the point of fighting a lawsuit. In the end, the master judged that everyone would not repair it and sent a local security officer to spend two jiao to repair it successfully immediately. Silk shoes and British leather shoes are valuable footwear. His shoes are protected by carpets in the house, and he has a car to take care of him when he goes out. Although the value is expensive, can that be compared to the ability of straw sandals to be commonly used? Isn't this what Mencius said, "The Way is near, but men seek it afar; the thing is in what is easy, but men seek it in what is difficult?" It seems that the revolution will succeed as long as the Three Principles of the People are implemented. What can't be overcome? What can't be shared under the same sky? Saying that you are happy, you want to fight, but you don't know when you will fight until. This is the same as the land temple only needing the local security officer to spend two jiao to repair it, but the villagers insist on making trouble. Isn't it the same? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education</h3>
<p>Pay Attention to Recovering Educational Rights in Concessions</p>
<p>This is the Spirit of the May Fourth Movement</p>
<p>Awaken the Efforts of All the People</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Dezheng, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Education, feeling that the failure to unify educational rights has a great impact on the life of the nation, has decided to strive to recover the educational rights in the concessions starting from May 4th. Chen ordered all educational institutions and educational groups, large, medium and small schools in the city to comply with this order and issued a declaration to notify Chinese and foreign people in the city. The instruction and declaration are copied as follows: The instruction is to order the matter to be accomplished. The anniversary of the May Fourth Movement is now approaching again. Recalling the heroic efforts of the students in the eighth year of the Republic of China in the Patriotic Movement is truly worthy of commemoration. More than ten years have passed since then, and all constructions have been hindered. The difficulty in sorting out the educational rights in the concessions in the city, for example, is not easy to promote. Since the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the bureau has been actively carrying out the movement to recover the educational rights in the concessions in order to unify the schools in the city. All faculty, staff and students of the schools must be aware of the problems of education in the concessions in the city. On the occasion of the May Fourth anniversary, it is hoped that teachers and students of all levels of schools in the city will continue the great spirit of ten years ago and devote themselves to the movement to unify the educational rights in the city, so that education in the concessions can be recovered and sorted out as soon as possible, and a great effect can be achieved in the work of resisting cultural aggression. To this end, a declaration is issued to order the school to pass it on to the faculty, staff and students for compliance.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Declaration</h3>
<p>All Chinese people, whether for the past glory of the country or for the welfare of the nation's survival, must negatively overthrow international imperialism, and the first step is to abolish unequal treaties. Positively, education, which is a century-old plan, must oppose cultural aggression, and the first step is to recover educational rights. The fact that the educational rights of the concessions in Shanghai Special Municipality should be managed by the Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Education is a fact, not a theory. The so-called concession is nothing more than a place where foreigners are allowed to live and do business. It is not a colony or a cession of land. The governance of Shanghai has not been lost, so the educational rights of Shanghai naturally belong to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education. Only in this way can the proper educational institutions in the city be developed, the fraudulent profit-making places in the name of education can be banned, and all school-age children and out-of-school adults can receive education. This is what the Chinese people in Shanghai thoroughly understand and urgently demand, and the foreign residents who cherish the welfare of China and foreign countries may not deny it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because of the inattention of the Chinese people in the past, education in the concessions in Shanghai has been left to foreigners since the opening of the port. Today, hundreds of thousands of citizens in the concessions are trapped in a bad environment without education. Shanghai, which is known as the most prosperous and enlightened city in the country, has such a stain and such an abnormal phenomenon under the rule of the National Government. This is a painful and important issue. The Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Education, which is in charge of all educational institutions in the city and bears the heavy burden entrusted by the citizens, is responsible for implementing universal education, and hereby makes an earnest expression and a solemn warning to the people of the country, the citizens, and the concession authorities.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the 16th year of the Republic, the bureau issued a declaration on the issue of Chinese education in the Public Concession. At that time, a field survey showed that, excluding the French Concession, which had no statistics, there were only four public schools in the Public Concession with only 1,191 children enrolled. Education funds only accounted for a little more than 1% of the city's total, while the annual fee for Western schools was silver 352,750 taels, and for Chinese schools, it was only 150,410 taels, which was more than half less. It was almost the same as the cost of the Western band. It was also found that the new budget of the Public Works Bureau in the 19th year of the Republic was 357,970 taels for four Western schools, and 176,240 taels for five Chinese schools run by Westerners, and 32,350 taels for three schools run by Chinese, including administrative expenses. Given the large area of the concession, the large number of Chinese children, and the large number of taxes collected from the Chinese, the unequal distribution of education funds is evident. Without considering whether the actual performance is good or bad, the education funds alone are enough to show the indifference of the concession authorities to the education of the tax-paying Chinese.</p>
<p>What is even more painful is that, in addition to these very few schools, there is absolutely no social education to speak of, but there are many bad things that harm society. In addition to establishing racecourses, libraries, concerts, clubs, etc. for Westerners themselves, not only do they not actively provide education to the Chinese, but they do not even prohibit anything that damages customs and morals. Bad publications are allowed to be published, dirty places are allowed to be established, and prostitutes and beggars are allowed to exist. Private schools that aim at profit are allowed to be opened, as if they will not let the hundreds of thousands of old and young men and women living in the concessions sink into the abyss of sin. Isn't this the matter? The few schools in the concessions are all perfunctory, and they will not only trap us Chinese in long-term ignorance and incompetence, but also carry out cultural aggression by foreign tribes, so that the Chinese will never have the opportunity to recognize our country's inherent morals and culture. After searching all unequal treaties, there is no provision that foreigners can operate or manage Chinese education in the concessions. Under the rule of the National Government, in the high tide of our revolution, it is even more unacceptable for it to exist illegally.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that the concession authorities will immediately realize the impropriety of their past actions and automatically return the educational rights of the Chinese in the concessions to the Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Education. The Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Education will uphold the will of the Chinese government and establish municipal schools, manage private schools, and set up social education according to the needs of the Chinese in the concessions, so that the education of the Chinese in the concessions can develop as well as the urban areas and good customs can be cultivated in the same way before the concessions are recovered.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>It is hoped that the foreigners living in Shanghai and the concession authorities will express their approval of the legitimate claims of the Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Education and handle the promulgation immediately. It is hoped that the Chinese and foreign people and citizens will pay attention to and assist. (Chen Dezheng, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Education)</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education</h3>
<p>A Letter to All Students in the City</p>
<p>Young students, this glorious May Fourth Festival has come to us again. Recalling today ten years ago, this bright, upright, tragic, and enthusiastic revolutionary movement really makes us feel respected and grateful for a long time. Because students are the foundation of the life of the nation and the driving force of the National Revolution, this patriotic movement broke the silent stagnation of the education sector in the past, making the entire education sector join the revolutionary front and strive for the work of the National Revolution. Today, our young students can still continue this great spirit and know how to encourage themselves and gather under the banner of the Three Principles of the People to shoulder the mission of liberating the Chinese nation. But dear students, you try to see how dangerous the environment of today's National Revolution is. The remaining warlords who have betrayed have revealed their hideous faces to destroy the situation of China's unification. The Communist Party members have accepted the conspiracy of Soviet Russia to do the dirty work of betraying the country and seeking glory. All corrupt and deteriorating forces have continued to grow under the violent shouts of the reactionaries. Therefore, all the construction plans of our revolutionary National Government have been greatly affected. The people have also suffered from the oppression and massacre of the reactionaries. Young students, you must have felt the instability of social life. This is what the betrayal of the reactionary warlords and the disruption of the Communist Party members have bestowed upon us. We must know that the purpose of the Chinese National Revolution is the freedom and equality of all China, and the path of the Chinese National Revolution is to believe in the Three Principles of the People of the Prime Minister and move forward. This road will never go wrong. Young students, of course, we cannot allow the warlords of the eighth year of the Republic of China to do the business of betraying the country, and we cannot allow the Communist Party members, who are more punishable than those traitors, to do the business of betraying the country. Therefore, we must commemorate the May Fourth Movement and continue the great spirit of the May Fourth Movement to fight against those reactionary warlords and Communist Party members who betray the country. Now the Communist Party members' means of selling short and buying long are increasingly exposed. They want to dedicate our entire China to Soviet Russia without any cost. Their hearts are more dangerous than the traitors of the May Eighth era. On the one hand, they destroy the National Revolution, and on the other hand, they wave the banner of revolution to lure young students with unstable will. Their plan is more vicious than the traitors of the May Eighth era. Our young students certainly do not want to tear up the glorious May Fourth Movement, which is deeply engraved in history, to the evil Communist Party members one day. We should understand that the purpose of the Kuomintang is to save the country, and the purpose of the Communist Party is to destroy the country. Thinking of the spirit of the May Fourth Movement ten years ago, we have to teach us to unanimously support our National Government, concentrate on the Three Principles of the People, and save our nation-state from the dangerous situation, and we have to teach us to unanimously overthrow the Communist Party members who betray the country, so as not to let them shake our Three Principles of the People revolutionary front. Today, we are recalling the great spirit of ten years ago and praying for the successors to carry forward the glory. On the one hand, we are also thinking about the rampant reactionary forces today and hoping that our classmates will recognize our path and our colleagues. You devote yourself to your studies and prepare for the great contributions in the future. On the one hand, you pay attention to your environment and carefully guard against the deathly temptation of reaction. The spirit of the May Fourth Movement has always been with us, and we cannot let this great commemoration be destroyed in the hands of the new traitors. We stand up and swear an oath: From now on, we will use the Twenty-Seven of the Three Principles of the People to instill in us. We shout the slogan [All power belongs to the Kuomintang] and continue the spirit of the May Fourth Movement under the guidance of the Kuomintang to eliminate all enemies who betray the party.</p>

<h3>The Rapid Advance of Japanese Baseball and Basketball</h3>
<p>Baseball Representatives Still in Fierce Competition</p>
<p>The Japanese Baseball Preparation Committee originally intended to have the winning team of the Spring University Baseball League, which is currently in competition, represent Japan at the Far Eastern Games. However, due to the undeniable strength of China and the Philippines and recognizing that the victory or defeat of baseball is the ultimate key to securing the overall championship, they are urgently seeking a safe plan. They decided to allow the winning team's coach to select experienced and skilled players and outstanding players from other schools participating in the league in order to form the best and strongest all-Japan representative team, striving to defend and actively maintain the baseball championship.</p>
<p>The six teams participating in the Tokyo University League are Waseda, Keio, Meiji, Hosei, Rikkyo, and the Imperial University. They compete twice a year in a double round-robin system for the championship. This year's spring competition began on April 12. Keio, the previous Far Eastern representative, was unfortunately defeated by strong rival Meiji University in the first match 10-9 and in the second match 2-4. The final match is scheduled to be held on May 20 due to scheduling issues. However, Waseda, the champion of last autumn's league, got off to a smooth start, defeating the Imperial University and Hosei in succession. They are currently ranked at the top. If they can defeat Meiji, which has a strong determination to dominate, their championship fate will depend entirely on the final battle with Keio. The two schools of Waseda and Keio have a long history of confrontation, and their games are watched by baseball enthusiasts, with popularity boiling across the country. When the two teams meet, they put aside the idea of strong and weak and rely on the rise and fall of fighting spirit and the good and bad of ball luck to determine the outcome. It is impossible to predict. Judging from the current situation, it can be said that Waseda, Keio, and Meiji will stand on three legs, and it is difficult to distinguish their strengths and weaknesses. Even if any one team wins the league championship, the selection committee will not bear to lightly regard the excellent players of the other two teams, so that good materials have the resentment of being buried and not meeting. It has been discovered that the opinion of powerful people in this field is also that it is a more stable and better strategy to form an army by mixing the capable players of the three teams to represent and attend the Far Eastern Games. If so, it would really be a great misfortune for China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Although the above three teams have gone through more than a month of fierce battles, their players will inevitably suffer from the disadvantage of physical and mental fatigue and relaxation. Since the league games are most often opened with a short period of several days of rest, Japanese experts are concerned about whether the players can recover their vitality and give full play to their abilities. This is an opportunity for China and the Philippines to take advantage of. If they can unite, cooperate, use strategies, and resolutely rise up and fight to the death with the Japanese army, then who knows who will win? According to Japanese information, the strength of the Philippine representative in this competition is strong, unlike the previous student team, which was naive and weak. The players of their basic team, the Customs Bureau, are all experienced and should have amazing performances. However, the Chinese team from Honolulu, the overseas Chinese team, has lost many times when they challenged strong Japanese university teams in recent years on their way to the United States. This time, they are not afraid of the hard work of traveling and come to serve their motherland. It is deeply hoped that the team members will pay attention to the importance of baseball teamwork and not fall into personal displays of glory. The warning of the previous mistakes is still there, but those who come can still catch up. May our Chinese baseball representatives encourage each other.</p>
<h3>Basketball Representatives Have Already Been Trained</h3>
<p>After announcing the 18 candidate players at the end of February, the Japanese basketball team that will attend the Far Eastern Games held a training camp in mid-March for half a month to train basic skills. The second phase of the training camp began yesterday, and they are actively practicing at the Tokyo First Middle School field every night. I have visited many times to observe, and I will briefly record what I have seen and heard for the reference of our country's players.</p>
<p>According to coach so-and-so, the players selected for the Japanese team this time are all top national players, and their individual skills have already reached their peak. However, since they were selected from all sides to form a team, the training received by each player in the past will inevitably be different. Therefore, during the training camp, the training of the team's cooperative skills will start with basic coaching step by step, so that all the players can completely abandon the different techniques they have learned in the past and become a new team with the same voice.</p>
<p>According to the reporter's observations, the Japanese team's practice focuses on the new five-man offense and defense method. There is no doubt that this is their main tactic. When retreating, they mostly use the five-man zone defense system ZONE METHOD OF FINEMAN DElENSEFTEE. When attacking, they always leave two guards in the back and let the three forwards move in the enemy area. The two guards pass the ball to each other to wait for the opportunity to attack. However, the Japanese focus on maintaining the ball they have already obtained. Unless the forward has a particularly good offensive, they will never let the ball leave the guard's hand, so that the enemy has more chances to snatch the ball. This tactic results in the disadvantage of being biased towards defense rather than offense. Also, their forward attacks mostly use the enemy area (referring to the area around the free throw line of the five-man defense method TOTYOW LINE as the starting point, and rarely advance from both sides. Their usual offensive method is that when the forward in our team has a special advantage, the guard passes the ball to a forward in the above area, and the forward passes it to another forward who has reached under the basket, and then he shoots the basket. In other words, it is to reach the basket by attacking from the center through two passes.</p>
<p>Another weakness of the Japanese team is that they are often slow and disorganized in changing formations from defense to offense or from offense to defense. If our team can pay attention to this point, we can use the technique of lightning-fast attack or the fierce search of the ball that has entered the enemy's hand at this moment to achieve amazing results.</p>
<p>Many members of the Japanese team are good at long-range shooting, but they do not easily try their skills unless the atmosphere is very tense and the outcome is difficult to determine (mostly in the second half). The long-range shooting location is mostly between the center line and the side line, and rarely in the center of the jump circle.</p>
<p>Japanese team candidates Kurosawa Takeo and Kawaguchi Shoji declared yesterday that they were leaving the team due to personal matters. The Japanese all regard it as a great loss, especially the departure of Kurosawa. He is a veteran player of Waseda University for many years and has attended the Far Eastern Games. His accurate throwing, fierce attack, and lively movements are indeed the first-class forwards in Japan.</p>
<p>The Japanese Far Eastern Basketball Team, which has been working hard in training, invited Waseda University and Rikkyo University to compete at the Kanda Youth Association Gymnasium on the afternoon of April 27 to show their skills and show their power. Because of their fast and wonderful passing, ever-changing offensive and defensive formations, and consistent and accurate shooting, they won both games, indicating that their strength is not weak. The results of the competition are as follows:</p>
<p>Team Names, First Half, Second Half, Total</p>
<p>Far Eastern Representatives, 21 points, 35 points, 56 points</p>
<p>Waseda University, 11 points, 13 points, 24 points</p>
<p>Far Eastern Representatives, 10 points, 21 points, 31 points</p>
<p>Rikkyo University, 7 points, 12 points, 19 points</p>

<h3>China's Basketball Team Achieves a Resounding Victory Over the Pittsburgh Team Yesterday</h3>
<p>Score: 66 to 15</p>
<p>Our basketball team, set to participate in the Far Eastern Games, is undergoing enthusiastic training in Shanghai. Mr. Jun Shouyi is sparing no effort, and recent training shows significant progress in skills. There is great confidence in winning the Far Eastern Championship. Recently, friendly matches have been frequently arranged with Western teams in Shanghai to gain formal training and work on overall skills. The first match was against the Macklin team, which was decisively defeated. Last night, a match was originally scheduled against the American Stars team, but the American players, feeling that the basketball season was over, were unwilling to participate. Therefore, the Pittsburgh team substituted, with only Smith, a YMCA instructor, joining them. Moreover, the Pittsburgh team members were not top-tier players, but their fighting strength was still considered decent. As a result, the Pittsburgh team was utterly defeated, with a score of 66 to 15.</p>
<p>Although tickets for last night's game were priced at one dollar, the audience was not deterred by the high price. Around 6 PM, the road leading to the Labor Father's Hall was filled with traffic and people vying to purchase tickets. The basketball hall was packed, filled with a lively atmosphere. As the athletes entered the arena, applause erupted, expressing admiration for their art and reverence for heroes. Various athletes from our country who will be attending the Far Eastern Games were also present to watch. Most notable were the Hong Kong football players and Ms. Li Lan, the female tennis star, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. Over a thousand spectators stood up to admire their grace. In addition, Liu Changchun and the female athletes from Harbin also drew considerable attention from the audience. It is indeed glorious for athletes to be welcomed everywhere.</p>
<p>The Chinese team appeared on the court at 6:30 PM to warm up, showcasing their agility and miraculous shooting skills. The audience erupted in enthusiastic cheers, expressing warm praise for each player. When the Pittsburgh team entered, they were also greeted with the same welcome. However, the audience was somewhat disappointed that instead of the American Stars team, they saw sailors from the Pittsburgh team in black shirts and white caps. Fortunately, Smith's inclusion provided some consolation.</p>
<p>As expected, the match began, and the Chinese athletes displayed their unique skills, fiercely attacking like hungry tigers seizing food. Their formidable momentum caused the blue-eyed team to become enraged and resist, leading to a tense situation. Although the Chinese team was brave, they found it difficult to overcome the defense, and the score remained unchanged for a long time. After the Chinese team scored two points from free throws, Liu Jianchang scored a basket. Smith of the opposing team bravely resisted, dribbling the ball deep under the basket and scoring a basket with his individual strength. When the Chinese team reached twenty points, Backhouse of the Pittsburgh team added three points. Both sides' performances reached their peak. Although the Pittsburgh team was not a strong team, they showed no weakness, and their fighting strength was quite substantial. The speed and passing skills of the Chinese team's performance were truly amazing. The score at halftime was 24 to 5.</p>
<p>In the first half, the Chinese team used their ideal lineup. Starting from the second half, except for Xiao Tang, the other four players were rotated. The momentum was not significantly reduced, but the tightness of the attack was slightly lessened. Working hard, the Chinese team's score gradually increased, while the Pittsburgh team also occasionally found opportunities to score. With eight or nine minutes remaining, the Chinese team reverted to their ideal lineup, and their momentum increased greatly. Coupled with the cheering, the athletes' determination was further ignited. The score steadily increased, reaching new heights. Xiao Tang, small, agile, and skilled in combat, was especially praised by the entire audience. As a result, the Chinese team won with a score of 66 to 15. The referee was Zhang Guoxun, and the inspector was Shu Hong.</p>
<p>The best lineup for the Chinese team was Tang Kun, Yao Enhan, Liu Jianchang, Wang Xiliang, and Li Guochen. Their agility and beautiful passing were truly dazzling. In addition, Lu Zhongen, Chen Shengkui, Wang Yuzhen, and Liu Guanjun also delivered amazing performances. Xiao Tang was the most outstanding player in the country, appearing and disappearing like a mouse, scoring the most points, a total of twenty-six points, the highest individual score in yesterday's game.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<h3>Public Letter from the Headquarters of the Chinese Boy Scouts</h3>
<p>To the Editor: The Headquarters convened the first general review and jamboree of boy scouts nationwide in the capital. The closing ceremony was held on the 22nd. After the ceremony, most of the troops immediately left Beijing in formation. Several hundred people were also successively awaiting departure. Unexpectedly, at 6 PM, the Jinan Boy Scouts and the Hubei Boy Scouts had a misunderstanding due to a language barrier during the previous day's negotiation regarding the camp raid, resulting in a conflict between the two sides. The staff of the office did their best to stop it. Eight injured Hubei Boy Scouts were treated by the health section of the office, and the Jinan Boy Scouts who caused the incident were detained and requested by the headquarters to be disciplined according to the Boy Scout discipline. The matter was originally very simple. Unexpectedly, the Japan News Alliance reported inaccurately on April 23, sending a telegram from Nanjing stating that the Jinan team and the Hubei team who participated in the national boy scout review a day ago quarreled over the distribution of awards, resulting in a mutual fight in which more than ten people were seriously injured and more than twenty people were slightly injured, and three people died from their injuries. The garrison headquarters also dispatched military police to suppress them, firing shots into the air for two minutes before dispersing, and there were also fears that communists were inciting them from within. The report was a complete fabrication, causing a sensation. The office informed the Central News Agency reporter of the situation, and the full text was published in the Central Daily News on the 25th and the News Report on the 25th and 26th. At the same time, Director Shi of the concurrent office sent a letter to the Japanese Consulate in Nanjing, pointing out the errors in the report. First, the cause of the conflict was inaccurate. Second, although there were eight people who fell and were injured due to the rain and muddy ground and were injured by punches, kicks, and sticks, no one died from their injuries. Third, although someone reported the initial conflict to the garrison headquarters by phone, the person in charge feared that misunderstandings would arise, so they immediately told them not to come, and no military police came to suppress them, and there was no firing shots into the air for three minutes before dispersing. As for the claim that communists were inciting them, it was even more absurd. Fourth, the Jinan School in Shanghai was mistaken for the Jinan School in Shandong, which was even more laughable. Subsequently, Uemura Shinichi, the Japanese consul in Nanjing, replied that he had summoned Sasaki Kenji, the resident Beijing representative of the Allied News Agency, to the consulate and instructed him to correct the errors in an appropriate manner. The consulate had sent a telegram to correct the errors and instructed the agency to be cautious in visiting news in the future. He was deeply concerned that the errors would be transmitted far away, so he issued this statement. This is addressed to the Shen Bao Newspaper. Commander He Yingqin, April, Republic of China, Year 19.</p>

<h3>Student Movement Commemoration</h3>
<p>A Commemoration Meeting will be held at Penglai Grand Theater at 9:00 AM. Today is the Student Movement Commemoration Day. The preparatory committee for the May Revolution Memorial Day in the Japanese Municipality has scheduled a memorial meeting at Penglai Grand Theater on Penglai Road at 9:00 AM this morning. Each school must send four representatives to participate in the grand event. Each group and organization must also send members to participate. In addition, the committee believes that the youth will be the mainstays of the country in the future. Because they are often tempted by others and go astray, this is a great danger to the future of the nation. Therefore, they have specially requested Yang Xingfo, Zheng Hongnian, and He Bingsong to come to the meeting to give speeches as a guide for the youth. The Municipal Executive Committee will also issue a letter to the youth and a letter to comrades (lengthy, omitted).</p>
<h3>The Recognition and Efforts That Should Be Made in Commemoration of the May Fourth Movement</h3>
<p>(1) The May Fourth Movement was a national self-determination and liberation movement produced in an environment where the youth of the country were externally subjected to the aggression and coercion of imperialism and internally suppressed and exploited by the warlord government. Domestic affairs were lost and the country was humiliated, internal politics were chaotic, corruption was rampant, and the people were struggling to survive, leading to drastic changes in thought. It was also a movement to save the people and the country promoted by the revolutionary ideas planted in society by our party for decades.</p>
<p>(2) The May Fourth Movement promoted political innovation and awakened society from its fascination with the new culture movement, which was no small feat. However, a group of young people failed to establish a central belief, lacked a sound organization and leadership, and were often used by others, heading down the path of non-revolution and anti-national interests without realizing it. Now, when we commemorate the May Fourth Movement, we must recognize that the Three Principles of the People are sufficient to lead the people of the country to strive for national revolution.</p>
<p>(3) When we commemorate the May Fourth Movement, we should invigorate the revolutionary spirit and patriotic enthusiasm of the May Fourth Movement to eliminate national traitors and foolish people, eradicate the anti-revolutionary groups of Yan Feng and others, cultivate physical and mental health, and aspire to become a constructive talent. We should unite under the leadership of our party and work together for the cause of national or local tutelage construction.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Commemoration</p>
<h3>Jinan Massacre Conference</h3>
<p>Held at the Penglai Grand Theater</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 3rd) was the memorial day of the May 3rd Jinan Massacre. It was a painful commemoration of the Japanese imperialists' slaughter of our country's diplomats, officials, and innocent civilians. The Preparatory Committee for the May Revolution Memorial Day in the Japanese Municipality had actively prepared for various matters in advance, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Shanghai community Jinan Massacre Memorial Conference was held at the Penglai Grand Theater. More than a thousand representatives from various party departments, government agencies, and organizations attended. Chen Dezheng presided over the meeting. Representatives from the Municipal Party Department, Bai Chuan, and representatives from the Preparatory Committee of the General Labor Union, Gu Yongquan and Li Yongxiang, gave speeches in succession, with painful and passionate language. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Conference Order (1) Opening (2) Stand at attention (3) Play music (4) Sing (5) Pay the highest respect to the party and national flag, the portrait of the Prime Minister, and the portraits of the soldiers and civilians killed in the May 3rd Massacre (6) The Chairman respectfully reads the Prime Minister's Last Will (7) Silence (8) The Chairman reports (9) The representative of the Municipal Party Department delivers a speech (10) Speeches (11) Shout slogans (12) Play music (13) Adjournment</p>
<p>Chairman's Report Chairman Chen Dezheng delivered the opening remarks, saying: "Distinguished representatives, comrades, we take this opportunity to commemorate the many compatriots and martyrs who were ravaged and harmed by imperialism in Jinan on May 3rd two years ago. I believe that all the representatives present will deeply imprint the tragedy that took place in Jinan two years ago in your minds when observing a moment of silence for the martyred heroes. The Jinan Massacre is a recent event and is the last cruel manifestation of imperialism heading towards the grave. The situation surrounding the occurrence of the massacre and the course of events need not be reported much because it is a recent event. I believe that everyone knows about it very well, not only knows about it, but also deeply grieves and sorrows over this matter. We are here to commemorate the May 3rd martyrs and the dead compatriots not as a routine matter, but with profound significance. We want to take this opportunity to talk about the significance of this massacre and make it a guideline for our future efforts. We know that although the May 3rd Massacre occurred in Jinan, the greatest goal of this massacre was not only in the Jinan area, but in the entire Republic of China. We must not think that because the place where we live is far from the location of the massacre, we have no personal pain and are indifferent. We must know that this massacre certainly happened in Jinan, and if compatriots across the country are unwilling to work hard and are unwilling to struggle, this kind of massacre can happen everywhere in China and can happen at any time. Because we see this point, we are aware that to prevent this kind of tragic event from ever happening again in China, there is no other plan but to rely on the Chinese people to be ambitious and work hard. There are always people who have a hollow hope of wanting other countries to speak justice and help China. This is an empty dream. To prevent the massacre from happening again in China, it depends on the Chinese people themselves and the efforts of the Chinese people. This is the first meaning of today's memorial meeting. The second point is to say that in China in this dangerous international environment, there can be no mutual assistance between countries, only mutual struggle. In this dangerous international environment, we understand that a small and weak nation is surrounded by enemies who want to besiege this nation. Although there is only one imperialist executioner like the one in the May 3rd Massacre, there must be more than one imperialist who wants to create this kind of massacre. We must know that all around us are wolves and tigers who want to annex our country, and absolutely no one is sincerely helping us. We must see clearly that those who use empty sweet words to deceive us are our enemies. Therefore, the only thing we can do is rise up from the dangerous environment and overthrow imperialism. This is the second meaning. We must know that all the past humiliations like the May 3rd Massacre have happened more than once. Before May 3rd, everyone knew about the May 30th Shanghai Nanjing Road Massacre, the June 23rd Shakertown Massacre, the September 5th Wanxian Incident, and the Hankou Incident. These many massacres have emerged endlessly in China. On the one hand, it certainly shows the fierce wolf face of imperialism, and on the other hand, it also shows that the Chinese people are too lacking in ambition. Therefore, at this memorial meeting, we should have a great realization that we must not be ambitious and work hard. There are still many massacres that will follow the May 3rd Massacre. We must work hard to be ambitious, and there is only one way: follow the Three Principles of the People that the Prime Minister instructed us and work hard and struggle. People must wash away the shame of the nation only by making the compatriots across the country believe in the Three Principles of the People and follow the Three Principles of the People. Conversely, if there are those who violate the Three Principles of the People, who outwardly obey the Three Principles of the People but secretly distance themselves from them, they are the enemies of the nation and the enemies who create national shame like the May 3rd Massacre. We must examine whether compatriots across the country believe in the Three Principles of the People, and we must examine whether those who already believe in the Three Principles of the People are truly and sincerely following them, and we must examine whether the whole country can strive for national ambitions. We believe that only the Three Principles of the People can wash away the extraordinary shame and humiliation of the nation and can wash away the pain of the May 3rd Massacre. What we cannot forget is that we must use the Three Principles of the People to wash away the shame of the May 3rd humiliation. At today's memorial meeting, everyone remembers the grievances of the May 3rd martyred heroes who have not been avenged, and the shame that the country left behind because of the May 3rd Massacre has not been eliminated. We must be very sad. In the end, there is only one sentence. I hope that everyone will not become passive because of grief, but actively strive for ambition, work hard, and go to the people to do training, publicity, and promote the work of the Three Principles of the People. That is all.</p>

<h3>Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association Sends Telegram Requesting Assistance for Fujian</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association sent an urgent telegram to the central government in Nanjing: "Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government in Nanjing, since the suspension of provincial administration in Fujian, all affairs have been in a dangerous state. For several months, we have not heard of any solution from the central government, which has only made the people of Fujian suffer deeply. Recently, the defeated troops of Gan and Jin have changed sides. Zhu and Mao have already passed the Yunmen Pass and joined forces with the bandits of Longyan, intending to seize the Zhangxia seaport, which affects the entire Fujian Province. Saving the Fujian border is the way to save the overall situation. We urgently hope that you will quickly determine practical measures to quell the banditry as soon as possible to prevent the spread of bandit disasters. We urgently submit this report and await your orders. The Shanghai Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association bows, Jiang."</p>
<h3>The Course of Events in the Suppression of Bandits in Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>From April 2nd to April 19th</p>
<p>The 13th Brigade and other units of the 5th Division under Xiong Shi were ordered to proceed to Taihu Lake to suppress bandits. In mid-March, Hu Zuyu, Brigade Commander of the 13th Brigade and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in Taihu Lake, led them to garrison in various lakeside counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Upon arriving in Jiangsu, Hu immediately began investigating bandit activities and planning the suppression. It was discovered that the lake bandits could be roughly divided into three major groups: the Haizhou gang, the Henan gang, and the Pudong gang. Mao Zilong, Zhang Zhaohua, Tian Kuaizi, Zheng Taida, and Taibao A Xu were identified as the main bandit leaders of these gangs, with a total of no fewer than four to five thousand bandits. They were also equipped with about half that number in firearms. These gangs had secret agencies in the Shanghai concessions, with the Haizhou gang being the most formidable.</p>
<p>Beginning on April 2nd, a series of fierce suppressions were carried out in places such as Chenmu Town, Da Yao Village, Jin Port in Jiangsu province, and Zhi Shan Temple and Tianping Bridge in Zhejiang province. As of April 19th, the Haizhou gang leader Zhang Zhaohua and the Henan gang leader Tian Kuaizi were captured alive, along with over 130 minor bandit leaders and scattered bandits. Over 400 bandits, including a fake regimental commander, regimental adjunct, and battalion commander, were killed. Our forces seized approximately 100 long and short firearms, countless broadswords, and intercepted 25 bandit boats and over 50 kidnapped men and women. The 5th Division suffered one officer and 28 soldiers wounded, and seven soldiers killed in action. One cook from the 3rd District of the Jiangsu Water Police was also killed. All captured bandits are currently undergoing strict interrogation. A detailed account of the bandit suppression operations carried out by the unit from April 2nd to April 19th is recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) On March 30th, it was reported that there were thirty to forty bandit boats with three to four hundred bandits in Yangcheng Lake, using Yang San Tai Temple as their stronghold. The 1st Battalion of the 28th Infantry Regiment, in coordination with the 12th Team of the 3rd District of the Jiangsu Water Police, was immediately dispatched to search. At approximately 2:00 PM, near Yangcheng Village in Yangcheng Lake, Wuxian County, several triangular white flags and hundreds of bandits were spotted near the lakeside. An immediate attack was launched.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Relying on the terrain and their numbers, the bandits resisted for several hours before fleeing southwestward under the cover of dusk. Several bandits were killed in this engagement, and one bandit boat was captured. One cook from the 12th Team of our Water Police was killed in action. The bandit stronghold at Yang San Tai Temple was subsequently burned down.</p>
<p>(1) On April 4th, Chen Yunxin, the company commander of the 1st Company of the 1st Battalion of the 28th Infantry Regiment, while patrolling the Dianshan Lake area, learned that there were twenty to thirty bandit boats with two to three hundred bandits near Chenmu Town, on the border of Kunshan and Wu counties. An immediate attack was launched. The bandits put up a stubborn resistance, and the battle lasted about two hours before they fled toward Dianshan Lake. More than ten bandits were killed in this engagement, three bandit boats were destroyed, and three kidnapped victims were rescued. One of our soldiers was wounded. It was discovered that this group of bandits belonged to the Pudong gang, led by Taibao A Xu.</p>
<p>(1) On the afternoon of April 6th, the 15th Team of the Jiangsu Water Police and the 2nd Detachment of the Guerrilla Force pursued and recovered three abandoned bandit boats and five rusty rifles in the Shengjia Bang area near Yuandang Lake. Over ten other bandit boats fled southward.</p>
<p>(1) On April 6th, Zhang Ting, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 25th Infantry Regiment, led the 7th Company and part of the 8th Company of his battalion on patrol near Chefang. He learned that there were thirty to forty bandit boats with three to four hundred bandits gathered at the Jinshan Temple in Da Yao Village, along the shore of Cheng Lake. An immediate attack was launched. Upon reaching the village at 2:00 PM, the bandits occupied the Jinshan Temple and put up a stubborn resistance. Seeing that our forces were outnumbered, they dared to repeatedly charge our troops. Our forces first used firepower to suppress them, then launched a bayonet charge, killing over ten bandits. The bandits then scrambled to seize boats and flee toward Cheng Lake under the cover of night. In this engagement, thirty to forty bandits were killed, five bandit boats and a large amount of loot were captured, and nine kidnapped men and children were rescued. Five rifles and one Mauser pistol were seized. One of our platoon leaders was seriously wounded, and three soldiers were killed in action. All the seized loot was claimed by its rightful owners. It was discovered that this group of bandits was the most ferocious of the lake bandits, the Haizhou gang, led by Mao Zilong and Zhang Zhaohua, with a force of five to six hundred men. They possessed several handheld machine guns, about a hundred rifles, and dozens of Mauser and other pistols. They called themselves the 3rd Division of the First Army of Jiangnan.</p>
<p>(1) On the morning of April 7th, Zhong Huan, the commander of the Western District and regimental commander of the 30th Infantry Regiment, led the 1st and 2nd Battalions of his unit to search westward from Changxing County. At 3:00 PM, it was reported that six to seven hundred members of the Broadsword Society were hiding at the Zhi Shan Temple, seven li from Huaihua Kan (reported yesterday). An immediate attack was launched. Contact was made with the bandits at about 4:00 PM. The bandits stubbornly resisted for three or four hours before fleeing into the deep mountains under the cover of night. In this engagement, over twenty bandits were killed and eighteen were captured. A large number of firearms, ammunition, flags, and other items were seized. One of our soldiers was killed in action, and four were wounded. It was discovered that this group of bandits consisted of about a thousand Broadsword Society members, carrying both broadswords and Mauser pistols. According to captured bandits, the bandit leader was surnamed Xu, and Mr. Wang and Mr. Zhang of Changxing County were also leaders.</p>
<p>(1) On April 10th, a patrol team from the 3rd District of the Zhejiang Water Police encountered a bandit boat in Dingjia Shan, Jiashan County. They immediately opened fire, captured one bandit boat, captured four bandits, killed two, seized two firearms, and rescued one kidnap victim.</p>
<p>(1) On April 11th, the 10th Team of the Jiangsu Water Police shot down three bandit boats, rescued six kidnapped victims, and seized several firearms in the Weijing Tang area of Yangcheng Lake. Later that evening, it was reported that the remnants of the Haizhou gang were hiding in Yangcheng Lake. On the morning of the 12th, Kuang Kunyu, the battalion commander of the 1st Battalion of the 28th Regiment, led the 2nd and 3rd Companies of his unit, along with a machine gun platoon and eight patrol boats from the 12th Team of the 3rd District of the Water Police, to launch a divided attack. At 11:00 AM, contact was made with the bandits at Li Jin Port in Yangcheng Lake. After a fierce battle that lasted until 3:00 PM, the gang of bandits was completely annihilated. In this engagement, twelve bandit boats were captured. All thirty-five kidnapped men and women were rescued. Thirty bandit rifles, seven Mauser pistols, and two other pistols were seized. Many more firearms were thrown into the lake by the bandits. A roll containing the names of the bandit members was also recovered. Two minor bandit leaders and six scattered bandits were captured. Over sixty bandits were killed, and many drowned while trying to escape into the water. The 1st Battalion suffered three soldiers wounded and three killed. Afterwards, various units of the army and the water and land police successively apprehended eight or nine escaped bandits. According to the bandits, only one bandit boat managed to escape at the time. It was said that the bandit leader Mao Zilong had already been killed in action on the 6th in the Da Yao engagement, but there was also a claim that he had landed at Taiping Bridge on the night of the 11th and escaped. This has not yet been confirmed. Zhang Zhaohua, the false chief of staff and brigade commander, fled alone after being dispersed in this battle. He was shot and captured in Sujiabang by Wang Jiamu, the chief of the 9th Sub-bureau of the Wuxing Public Security Bureau, leading his unit together with the local defense merchant corps and the Jiangsu Water Police guerrilla force.</p>
<p>(1) In the Western District, around Changxing, approximately two thousand bandits, consisting of the lake bandit Zheng Gong, the Broadsword Society bandit Xu, and Zhang Minggao, the head of the local defense corps of that county, were mixed together under the instigation of the rebel Zhou Fengqi. On the morning of the 15th, they attacked Si'an Town. Due to the disparity in numbers, the 2nd Regiment of the Zhejiang Security Forces stationed in the town, under Commander Wang, suffered dozens of soldier casualties and was forced to retreat to the Tianping Bridge area. Upon receiving the report, Zhong Huan, the commander of the Western District, immediately dispatched Feng E, the commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 30th Regiment, leading the 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 7th Companies of his unit, to advance to Lincheng Bridge that evening. Deputy Commander Hang Yi also personally led the 3rd Company of his unit to join them. At 1:00 AM on the morning of the 16th, they advanced on Si'an in two routes from Lincheng Bridge.</p>
<p>Contact was made with the bandits near Tianping Bridge, and the attack began. The bandits put up a stubborn resistance near Kongshan Mountain. After a fierce battle lasting several hours, the bandits finally collapsed and fled into the mountains. Si'an Town was retaken at the hour of Yi on the 16th. In this engagement, the fake bandit regimental commander Wang Zibin, the fake lieutenant colonel regimental adjunct Li Guangyin, the fake battalion commander and former local defense corps trainer Yu, and over three hundred scattered bandits were killed. Over one hundred were captured. Commander Feng's battalion seized over twenty Mauser pistols, rifles, and many broadswords. Commander Feng's battalion suffered several soldier casualties. The remaining bandits are currently being pursued.</p>
<p>(1) On the 18th, according to a secret report, Tian Kuaizi, a notorious bandit leader of the Henan gang of lake bandits, secretly went to Shanghai to privately purchase military equipment to supply the bandit leader Zheng Gongda. Reliable sources were secretly dispatched to Shanghai, and on the morning of the 19th, the bandit Tian was apprehended in the French Concession.</p>

<p>Public Concession</p>
<h3>News of the Tram Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>Negotiations Break Down</p>
<p>Hu Ziyu, the compradore of the Public Concession Tram Company, went to Room 205 of the Central Hotel from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM yesterday to begin talks with the representatives sent by the Strike Committee and twenty or so participating workers. Hu Ziyu stated that the company was quite anxious about the strike and was willing to quickly resolve the issue. The rice subsidy of three yuan was not a problem, and wages could also be increased by three yuan. Wages during the strike period could not be paid, the wages of coppersmiths could not be increased, and other conditions could not be discussed. The representatives and workers were quite indignant upon hearing this and immediately replied to the compradore that the conditions offered were too far from the thirteen demands proposed by the workers and were intended to divide the workers' solidarity. The representatives were only responsible for talking with the compradore and did not have the mission to resolve the issue. As for how to resolve it, it would have to wait for the order of the Strike Committee and the consent of all the workers. Thus, a negotiation was declared a breakdown. After receiving the report from the representatives and workers, the Strike Committee held an emergency meeting and unanimously decided: (1) To insist on the conditions and not resume work until complete victory is achieved; (2) All workers driving trams, selling tickets, coppersmiths, repairing tracks, and pulling street lights will act in unison and will never fall for the capitalists' tricks of division and separation; (3) To convene a mass meeting of the new station and old station (4th) this morning to report on the negotiations with the compradore. Coppersmiths will also convene a plenary meeting to report and discuss how to respond; (4) To warn a certain . thief; (5) To issue leaflets to the workers; (6) To intensify various preparations to engage in a protracted war with the capitalists.</p>

The company has trained a total of over forty Russian drivers, of whom thirty have already obtained licenses. As for the strike situation, there is still no change, and it is feared that it will not be easily resolved in a short time. It is heard that the company does not want to negotiate with the workers until they elect worker representatives.</p>

<h3>Notifying Date of National Calendar Accounting</h3>
<p>Regarding the date of accounting after the business community's adoption of the National Calendar, the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee yesterday replied to the Inland River Steamboat Bureau Trade Association, stating, "We received your letter of the 28th of this month asking whether the collection of accounts in three installments will still be handled according to the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and New Year's Festival of the National Calendar. The method of changing to the National Calendar for accounting, which was approved and announced last year, was also notified to various industries for reference in a separate letter. The method is to collect accounts in three installments on the last days of May, September, and December of the National Calendar. Those who previously used the end of the large and small months will also change to the end of the large and small months of the National Calendar. All of these methods were submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to the Executive Yuan, which then submitted them to the National Government for a unified national implementation. It is not limited to this port. The statement in your letter that it must be consistent with the overall situation to proceed is somewhat misunderstood.

<p>National Pharmaceutical Federation</p>
<h3>Please Ask the Education Department to Explain the Chinese Medicine Society</h3>
<p>The local National Pharmaceutical Organizations Federation recently petitioned the National Government through the Ministry of Education to rename Chinese medicine schools to Chinese Medicine Societies. Pharmaceutical organizations in various places were quite uneasy and requested the Federation to preside over the matter. The Federation has submitted a petition to the Ministry of Education for explanation. The original petition is copied below: We read in the newspaper on March 23rd that the Ministry of Education reported that the name of Chinese medicine schools would be changed, and petitioned the Executive Yuan to forward it to the National Government. The original text roughly stated that Chinese medicine talks about metaphysics or relies on experience. The establishment of schools has always been based on science. If specialized schools above the undergraduate level are established for Chinese medicine, all high school graduates may not be suitable. If secondary schools are established, they may not recruit students with elementary school graduation and scientific knowledge. In addition to rescinding Proclamation No. 8, for the sake of improving Chinese medicine, Chinese medicine should move towards scientific and free research during this transitional period. The organization of places for researching Chinese medicine should be called Chinese Medicine Societies so that they become academic organizations. It seems unnecessary to be eager to establish schools at present. Investigating whether Chinese medicine does not conform to scientific justice is a matter in the hearts of the people. It should not be exaggerated by those who are biased, nor should it be污 by those who oppose it. The National Government has the clear instruction to maintain it, as seen in the previous decrees, and the Ministry of Education has replied that it does not want to eliminate Chinese medicine, as seen in the later documents. From this point of view, the government has no intention of eliminating Chinese medicine, which is clear. Chinese medicine is indeed an academic subject, but it is also a profession. Therefore, on the one hand, academic research should be conducted, and on the other hand, occupational security must still be sought. At present, although the central Chinese medicine regulations have not been promulgated, single-line methods have been implemented in many places. All of these single-line methods take graduation from Chinese medicine schools as the qualification for Chinese medicine practitioners to register without examination. Although the Ministry of Education hopes that Chinese medicine will be studied in societies and that schools need not be established eagerly, the entire text also certainly does not hope that the mechanism for producing Chinese medicine talents will be interrupted. However, a society is a type of organization. In terms of its name, it is the same as calling the affiliated association a Chinese Medicine Society, which is an academic organization. It is not known whether these Chinese Medicine Societies can enroll students. After graduation, can they be registered without examination in the single-line methods for managing Chinese medicine in various places and in the Chinese medicine regulations to be promulgated by the central government in the future, allowing them to practice medicine? Has the planning of its training methods, performance test standards, and review of results been planned? It should be submitted for explanation, one point. Respectfully reading the original petition of the Ministry of Education to change all Chinese medicine schools to Chinese Medicine Societies shows that the intention of our people is nothing more than to avoid the restrictions on academic qualifications for Chinese medicine schools and to hope that Chinese medicine will move towards scientific research. Although Chinese medicine has not been promoted by the government before, our Chinese medicine community has not dared to abandon its responsibility. We have raised funds to establish academic organizations for academic research and to establish Chinese medicine schools to cultivate talents for nearly twenty years. Are the teaching materials of all current Chinese medicine schools all metaphysical? Are their enrollments all unqualified? Does the Ministry of Education have确切 evidence and statistics on this? Are Chinese medicine schools that do not talk about metaphysics and enroll qualified students still allowed to be established? Or are they all not allowed? This should be explained, two points. We dare to prepare this document and respectfully request your department to review it and promptly issue instructions to dispel public doubts.</p>

<h3>The Emei Steamer Stranding and Rescue Efforts</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Yangtze River steamer Emei, which ran aground at Yangluo, underwent extensive repairs in Shanghai. Last Tuesday, it departed from Shanghai with 1,588 bales of cotton yarn destined for Chongqing to resume operations on the Sichuan River. The steamer proceeded upstream along the French Concession. On the 2nd, at 5 a.m., it sent a telegram to Shanghai stating that the journey was smooth and that it would soon depart from Xunyang for Hankou. However, yesterday at 1 p.m., the Bureau received a telegram from Hankou stating that on the 3rd, at 4:30 a.m., the Emei steamer ran aground on a shoal five miles above Jiujiang and below Yangluo. The ship's hull was stuck in the sand and mud at the bottom of the river, rendering it unable to move.</p>
<p>Dispatching a Steamer for Rescue: Upon receiving the news of the Emei's grounding, the Shanghai Bureau immediately dispatched an urgent telegram from the Shipping Department to Wang Hao, the director of the Hankou branch. The telegram instructed Wang to promptly dispatch the Lijii tugboat, along with a group of workers, to the site of the incident from Hankou to provide assistance, given that the heavily loaded Emei was unable to move on its own. The telegram suggested that the Lijii attempt to tow the Emei. If that proved impossible, the workers should unload the cargo from the Emei's holds onto barges to lighten the ship, making it easier to tow. The telegram emphasized that this would be a safer approach. Requesting Naval Protection: The site where the Emei ran aground is known to be frequented by bandits, and the value of the cargo on board is considerable. Given the unrest in the upper reaches of the river, Long Xiaju, the head of the Shanghai Bureau's Shipping Department, telegraphed the Naval Office in Hankou yesterday afternoon, requesting that Director Wang dispatch a warship to Yangluo to protect the Emei and the Lijii tugboat during the rescue operation, in order to prevent theft.</p>
<p>Extent of Damage: At approximately 2 p.m. yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau received a second wireless message from Hankou stating that the ship's engineer had conducted a thorough inspection of the Emei since it ran aground, but the condition of the ship's hull was still unknown. However, one of the ship's steam pipes had ruptured. The message requested that the Shanghai Bureau promptly contact the Jiangnan Shipyard to arrange for a replacement to be shipped as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3>The Xinfeng Steamer Damaged En Route</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Northern Seas steamer Xinfeng, which was traveling south from Tianjin, departed from Tanggu on the 2nd, intending to proceed to Yantai. At approximately 5 p.m. yesterday, the steamer sent a wireless message to Shanghai stating that it had collided with a barge within the Hai River after departing from Tianjin and Tanggu. The message indicated that the Xinfeng's bow had been damaged and that it had returned for repairs. The message was brief and did not provide details about the extent of the damage to the barge. As a result, the Xinfeng's arrival in Shanghai will be delayed for an indefinite period.</p>
<h3>Price Increase for Northern Seas Japanese Steamships</h3>
<p>The Japanese-owned Dalian Steamship Company, citing the daily increase in the price of gold, has decided to increase ticket prices for the Shanghai-Tianjin route starting from the 8th of this month. First-class tickets from Shanghai to Tianjin, originally priced at 70 yuan, will now cost 80 yuan. Third-class tickets, originally priced at 15 yuan, will now cost 18 yuan. First-class tickets from Shanghai to Qingdao, originally priced at 38 yuan, will now cost 45 yuan. Third-class tickets, originally priced at 10 yuan, will now cost 12 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warship Kasuga Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The training warship Kasuga, dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of the Navy, arrived from Keelung, Taiwan, at 6:30 a.m. yesterday and is currently docked in the Huangpu River at Berth No. 7. The students and officers have all disembarked to tour the city. The ship will remain in Shanghai for three days before returning to the Sasebo Naval Base.</p>

<p>Resigned Patrol Officer</p>
<h3>Six Hundred Thousand Yuan Swindle</h3>
<p>Attracting Large Deposits with High Interest Rates</p>
<p>Then Fleecing Borrowers with Exorbitant Interest</p>
<p>Obtained Six Hundred and Forty Thousand in Four Years</p>
<p>Falsely Claiming Kidnapping to Conceal</p>
<p>Fled to Tianjin, then Returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>Depositors, Unable to Endure, File Lawsuit</p>
<p>Yang Shulin, a native of Tianjin, who previously served as a patrol officer in the First Precinct of the Fourth District of Zhabei, resigned in 1925. On August 15 of the same year, he established the Hexing Company on Gonghe Road in Zhabei. Subsequently, he opened the Wenji Company at 4089 Changsha Road in the Public Concession. The stated business scope of these two companies was pawnbroking and accepting deposits. Exorbitant Interest Rates: He lured depositors with high interest rates, and many greedy individuals fell into his trap, depositing cash into the two companies. The loans he issued were also subject to exorbitant interest rates, ranging from 5 to 6 percent per month, with a minimum of 3 to 4 percent. Borrowers, aware they were drinking poison to quench their thirst, did not hesitate to borrow despite the high interest rates because the loan terms were more lenient than those offered by legitimate financial institutions.</p>
<p>Bill Discounting: In addition to these two types of business, he also engaged in bill discounting. He would provide cash for unexpired checks, charging a significant discount fee. Individuals needing cash for circulation were willing to pay the extra cost.</p>
<p>Six Hundred and Forty Thousand: Yang had been operating this business for four years, accumulating deposits of 640,000 yuan by January of this year. The number of depositors was in the hundreds. His agility and cunning were truly astonishing.</p>
<p>Deposits Pouring In: Among the depositors was Cao Youshan, the owner of the Ruizhong Hotel. Cao's accountant had previously worked with Yang, who used their acquaintance to promote the benefits of depositing with his company, highlighting the high interest rates. Enticed by the profits, Cao not only deposited his own funds but also encouraged his relatives to deposit, accumulating a total of 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Falsely Claiming Kidnapping: On January 16 of this year, Cao, again at Yang's request, deposited another 1,500 yuan. Yang, who had amassed over 600,000 yuan within four to five years of resigning as a patrol officer, harbored malicious intent. On January 17, he sent a letter to his Wenji Company, claiming that he had been kidnapped and had resisted the kidnappers, resulting in injuries. He claimed to be receiving treatment at a certain hospital.</p>
<p>Letter from Tianjin: The company's employees, believing Yang had truly been kidnapped and injured, spread the news among the depositors. Initially, they did not react. However, after some time, Yang's friend at the Datong Hotel received a letter from Yang postmarked in Tianjin. Upon reading it, they realized that the earlier reports were a hoax orchestrated by Yang. After sending the letter claiming kidnapping and hospitalization, Yang had secretly returned to his hometown of Tianjin and was hiding at the Samsung Company in Tianjin.</p>
<p>Still Plotting Escape: The depositors soon discovered the truth and sent representatives to Tianjin to negotiate, demanding that Yang return to Shanghai to settle the deposits. Yang had no choice but to return and discuss the matter with the depositors at the law firm of Ye Fukan. At that time, the depositors only demanded the return of their deposits, and Yang agreed to repay them, so no rupture occurred. However, Yang's promise to repay was merely a ruse to buy time and plot another escape. To this day, none of the hundreds of depositors have received a single penny.</p>
<p>Arresting the Messenger: Cao Youshan, who had deposited a large sum, paid close attention to Yang's movements. Learning that he was planning to flee again soon, Cao had Yang's messenger, a man from Jiangbei named He Qiqing, arrested on Beizhefa Road and taken to the Huishi police station. After questioning by the detective, he was transferred to the Xinzha police station. Arrest at the Inn: He confessed that Yang Shulin was hiding in Room 21 of the Lingnan Hotel on Wuchang Road in Hongkou. Detective Liang Baosheng, detective Gao Yanrong, and Western detective Ji Keshi were dispatched to arrest Yang.</p>
<p>Many Spectators: Yesterday morning, Yang and He were brought to the Special District Court, where Judge Sun Yuan presided over the second courtroom. The only plaintiff was Cao Youshan, who, represented by lawyer Ye Fukan, accused Yang and others of embezzlement. He's lawyer was Fan. The other depositors who knew of Yang's arrest also attended the hearing, numbering about eighty or ninety. Many other depositors who were unaware of the case did not attend.</p>
<p>Adjourned for Retrial: After lawyer Ye presented the case, Judge Sun interrogated Yang Shulin, who stated that the company was co-founded with a Xie, with a capital of 20,000 yuan, and that Wenji had been established in 1918, initially on Wuma Road and later moved to Changsha Road. He Qiqing testified that he had been employed by the Hexing Company as a messenger since October 6, 1926, with an initial monthly salary of 20 yuan, later increased to 30 yuan. Judge Sun ordered both defendants to be detained and adjourned the trial for another date.</p>
<p>A Major Swindle: Among the cases of commercial fraud that have occurred in Shanghai in recent years, the most significant was the case of the German Heilongdaofu, who fraudulently obtained over one million yuan in foreign exchange loans from Chinese and foreign banks by falsely establishing the Heilong Trading Company. The amount defrauded in this case, at 600,000 yuan, can be said to be the largest since the Heilong case.</p>

<h3>Songjiang Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Haggling Over Price with Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>Girl Points Out Boy as Kidnapper</p>
<p>Three More Kidnappers Arrested on a Dung Boat</p>
<p>A Total of Seven Kidnapped, Three Already Taken Elsewhere</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, the Second District Police Station of the Nanshi area cracked a major kidnapping case from Songjiang, near the Wai Rihui Port and Luban Road Bridge. Four male and female child hostages were rescued on the spot, and four male and female kidnappers were arrested. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arguing with Rickshaw Pullers: Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, Police Officer Zhang Guobi, number 47 of the Liyuan Road station of the Second District Police Station, Nanshi, was standing guard at the Luban Road Bridge when he noticed several poorly dressed men and women standing at the corner of the road, haggling over the price with two rickshaw pullers. A young man looked angry and was about to attack the rickshaw pullers. Seeing this, the police officer, fearing trouble, quickly stepped forward to mediate.</p>
<p>Girl Points Out Kidnapper: The police officer approached the group and asked what was happening. A young, short-haired girl pointed to an angry young man and said that he was a kidnapper and that they were all hostages, pleading for rescue. Before she could finish speaking, the young man turned and fled towards the French Concession. The police officer, concerned for the hostages, did not give chase but instead apprehended a female kidnapper on the spot. She was brought to the Liyuan Road police station along with two female hostages and one child hostage, accompanied by the rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>Leading Police to Gang Boat: The police officer reported the incident to Patrol Chief Wang Shengsan, who questioned everyone in detail. According to the two female hostages, there were more hostages being held on a dung boat in an unfamiliar harbor, and they requested that police be dispatched to rescue them immediately. Patrol Chief Wang, upon hearing this, immediately led patrol leaders Shen Chuanxian and police officers Xie Chaochen and Sun Jimin, all armed with guns, and took the female kidnapper in the original rickshaws to the Wai Rihui Bridge. The female kidnapper pointed out a boat as the location where the hostages were being held.</p>
<p>Three Kidnappers and One Hostage: After the female kidnapper identified the boat, Patrol Chief Wang and the police approached the harbor and saw three men in short clothes standing on the boat. They raised their guns to warn them. Knowing that they could not resist, the three kidnappers surrendered and came ashore. Patrol Leader Shen Chuanxian was the first to jump onto the boat, but before he could steady himself, a person suddenly rushed out of the cabin. Suspecting that this person was a kidnapper, Patrol Leader Shen fired three shots into the air and dragged the person out of the cabin. However, this person was not a kidnapper but a hostage who had been forcibly confined.</p>
<p>Water Police Assist in Arrest: While Patrol Chief Wang and others were searching the boat, Water Police Captain Xu Jizhen, having heard the news, arrived with Police Officer Zhao and detectives Cao Junda from the Second District Police Station to assist in the search. They found three rifles and three bullets. Patrol Chief Wang took all the kidnappers and hostages, as well as the two rickshaw pullers and rickshaws with city numbers 3336 and 4128, to the Second District Police Station. The boat was temporarily impounded by the Water Police. District Chief Wang immediately reported the matter to the police chief by telephone and questioned each of the kidnappers and hostages in detail. Kidnapped Family of Six: According to female hostage Chen Shen, 45 years old, who lived in Songxie Town, Eighteen Miles, Dongxiang, Songjiang, her family farmed and owned 80 mu of good land. On the night of the 1st of this month, around 9:00 PM, more than ten short-clothed kidnappers suddenly came and surrounded the house, kidnapping the entire family of six and taking them to a dung boat in a nearby river. Chen's husband, Chen Younian (44 years old), and son, Chen Xizu (20 years old), were not at home and thus were not kidnapped. However, three of the six kidnapped family members were taken elsewhere on another boat last night (the night before last).</p>
<p>Half Taken Elsewhere: Chen's daughter-in-law, Gu, 24 years old, and her husband, Chen Xizu, were kidnapped together with Chen's aunt, and only Gu, the aunt, and Chen's 9-year-old grandson, Xudong, escaped. The 60-year-old great-aunt, Chen Jin, as well as the uncle, Xingsheng (38 years old), and a tailor from the same village, Xia Jinshan (18 years old), were taken to an unknown harbor on another small boat with guns and weapons around 6:00 PM last night (the day before yesterday).</p>
<p>Demanding 250,000 Yuan: The male hostage, Wu Gui, 43 years old, a neighbor of Chen Shen from the same village, owned more than 30 mu of land and had a family of eight, with a wife, Jin, three sons, and three daughters. He was kidnapped at the same time as Chen Shen on the 1st of this month. The kidnappers demanded 250,000 yuan from the two families. They were mistreated and confined to the cabin, bound hand and foot, for a day and night. The boat passed through Hengjing and arrived in Shanghai this afternoon, where they were rescued.</p>
<p>Kidnappers' Confessions: After questioning each of the hostages, District Chief Wang questioned the female kidnapper, Yang Yin, 33 years old, from Suzhou, who lived in the French Concession in Shanghai. She stated that the boat had arrived in Shanghai and that they were planning to hide the hostages ashore while waiting for the ransom. One kidnapper, Zhuang Wansheng, 32 years old, from Fengjing, admitted to gathering 18 accomplices to kidnap the Chen family. Another kidnapper, Meng Atang, 40 years old, from Fengjing, and Ye Chishan, 26 years old, from Anhui, denied being kidnappers, claiming that they were boatmen and were forced by the kidnappers to transport them. After questioning, District Chief Wang ordered the kidnappers and hostages to be separated and detained for further interrogation before being sent to the police headquarters for review.</p>
<h3>House Collapse on Penglai Road Causes Disaster</h3>
<p>One Dead, One Injured</p>
<p>At 390 Penglai Road, across from the Penglai Market, a Zhu family residence was undergoing renovation of the eastern side, with Wang Xueji as the contractor. Yesterday at 10:30 AM, while workers were excavating the foundation to lay a foundation of cement and sand, they inadvertently disturbed the adjacent tenement building at 377 Shu Jiuzu, causing it to collapse suddenly. A young apprentice, Zhang Ada, 13 years old, from Beicai, Pudong, was killed instantly. A worker, Shen Junsheng, 21 years old, from Pudong, was injured, suffering a waist injury. The West District Fire Brigade, located nearby, received the news quickly. Director Xia Guoliang immediately dispatched an ambulance and supervised the staff to the scene. The body of the crushed child was immediately retrieved, revealing a fractured skull. Director Xia, together with Section Chief Meng of the Second Precinct of the Second District and the police, helped the injured Shen Junsheng into the ambulance and sent him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. The injuries to his waist and limbs were found to be minor. The collapsed house was found to be the property of the Education Bureau, with two tenement buildings connected to each other. The contractor, Wang Xueji, failed to support the adjacent wall when excavating the foundation, causing it to collapse under the weight, resulting in this tragedy. Wang Xueji's negligence is unforgivable. Afterwards, Jin Qiren, the local land manager of the 22nd shop, reported the incident to the local court for investigation.</p>

<p>Huaxin Company</p>
<h3>Manager and Salesman Mutually Accuse</h3>
<p>Salesman Accuses Manager of Illegal Detention</p>
<p>Manager Accuses Salesman of Huge Embezzlement</p>
<p>Yu Jiahao Released on Bail of 130,000 Taels</p>
<p>Yu Jiahao hired a lawyer to sue Huang Zhendong, the manager of Huaxin Company, in the French Concession court for illegal detention. Huang Zhendong also hired a lawyer to countersue Yu Jiahao for huge embezzlement. The court summoned both parties yesterday, and Judge Zhu presided over the criminal trial. Huang Zhendong stated that Huaxin Company had previously employed Yu Jiahao as a salesman, who then resigned without reason the following year. Subsequently, the company received a notice from the Jianghai Customs stating that the company had evaded customs duties seven times. After investigation, it was found that Yu Jiahao was solely responsible for these customs evasions, totaling over 136,000 yuan. Therefore, they located Yu in a certain sugar store and invited him to a certain hotel to inquire about the embezzlement. At that time, Yu Jiahao repeatedly pleaded with the businessmen to preserve his reputation and was willing to have his father come to Shanghai to negotiate a settlement. The businessmen were very lenient and allowed him to stay in their home, going out to drink and bathe every day. Later, his father came to Shanghai to discuss a settlement with the businessmen, agreeing to send someone to negotiate, and then left. Unexpectedly, not long after, a full squad of French police officers arrived with guns, claiming to have received a report that there was a kidnapping at the businessman's home. They took Yu Jiahao into custody, but the businessmen were only discussing the embezzlement with Yu Jiahao and had no intention of kidnapping him. They were falsely accused and requested a thorough investigation. The lawyer representing Huang Zhendong stated that his client retained Yu Jiahao at home to negotiate a solution in order to preserve Yu Jiahao's reputation. Unexpectedly, Yu Jiahao acted maliciously and falsely reported a kidnapping, falsely accusing Huang Zhendong of illegal detention. Yu Jiahao's intent to turn against his accuser is evident, and he requested permission to countersue. Yu Jiahao stated that the businessman's home was located inside the Xiaodongmen in the Chinese area. Huang Zhendong came to invite the businessman to a certain hotel in the jurisdiction to talk. Upon arriving at the hotel, two strangers showed pistols and threatened me to write a statement. They also illegally detained me in his home for five days until the police arrived and released me. However, the businessman was unaware of the tax evasion. Previously, when the businessman was working at the company, Huang secretly discussed a matter with a certain person and gave the businessman 500 yuan. This is true. The lawyer representing Yu Jiahao stated that Huaxin Company's customs office was located on Renji Road in the Public Concession, while Yu Jiahao lived inside the Xiaodongmen in the Chinese area. The embezzlement case alleged by Huang Zhendong is not under the jurisdiction of the court and should be dismissed. Huang Zhendong should not have illegally detained Yu Jiahao at No. 568 Avenue Joffre and threatened him with a pistol, which is a criminal offense and should be investigated. The judge ordered Yu Jiahao to post 130,000 taels of silver as bail and to await a decision on whether the case will be accepted by this court.</p>
<p>Beautiful Young Lady</p>
<h3>Unwilling to Marry Ugly Husband</h3>
<p>Requests Termination of Engagement</p>
<p>The Young Lady is Charming</p>
<p>The Fiance is Too Ugly</p>
<p>The Judge Hopes for Reconciliation</p>
<p>The beautiful young lady, Shen Xiaomei, has a fair face and a slender figure. She is a gem of a girl from a modest family. Her home is located six li north of Zhenru, at No. 30, Lane 10, Jiangqiao. Xiaomei is eighteen years old this year. When she was eleven years old, her mother, Shen Zhangshi, arranged an engagement through a matchmaker to marry Liu Aliu, from the Liu family's residence in Lane 9 nearby. Aliu is sixteen years old this year, but his body is undeveloped and he is unusually short. Therefore, Xiaomei is quite dissatisfied and has repeatedly argued with her mother to terminate the engagement. However, both parties' marriage certificates have been lost, and there is no one to convey her wishes. Now, Shen Xiaomei has hired lawyer Gong Yingxuan to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court to terminate the engagement on the grounds that the defendant (her fiancé) Liu Aliu is foolish and suffers from a nervous disorder. For the sake of her lifelong happiness, she requests permission to terminate the engagement. Furthermore, due to taking medicine for infantile convulsions when she was young, his movements are clumsy and his stature is short and useless. Moreover, the engagement was made without my consent, so it is naturally invalid. The defendant hired lawyer Yao Xichen to present a defense. Judge Tong presided over the hearing yesterday morning. Both parties arrived in court with their lawyers. The plaintiff Shen Xiaomei stated that she was deceived by the matchmaker when the engagement was made, and her mother, unaware of the situation, rashly agreed to the engagement. Her family only provided a small Bazi (eight characters of birth) post, and they sent a pair of gold wire bracelets and 24 yuan as gifts. (Question) Why don't you want to marry him? (Answer) Last year, his (referring to Aliu) sister-in-law was working in the field and told my mother that he had taken too much medicine for infantile convulsions when he was four years old, which damaged his brain. Now I don't like him and I don't want to marry him. (Note: Shen Xiaomei was wearing a yuan-colored silk ge qipao, a yuan-colored padded jacket. Her hair was not yet cut. She was tall and graceful, quite charming. Compared to Liu Aliu, who was wearing a blue cloth long gown, blue cloth pants, cloth shoes, and a melon-skin hat, standing no more than three feet tall, his short stature made him look like a ten-year-old from behind. The difference in height between the man and woman standing in the courtroom was vast. No wonder Xiaomei was unwilling.) The judge asked the defendant Liu Aliu his age, and the judge noted that due to the age difference between the plaintiff and defendant, a legal representative was required. (Question) Who else is in the plaintiff's family? (Answer) Mother, Shen Zhangshi. (Question) Who else is in the defendant's family? (Answer) Older brother, Liu Lansheng. The judge ordered Shen Zhangshi and Liu Lansheng to appear in court. The judge asked Shen Zhangshi, "Did your daughter file a lawsuit, do you agree?" (Answer) "Yes, I agree." Thus, Shen Zhangshi was listed as the plaintiff, and Liu Lansheng was listed as the defendant. The judge ordered the lawyers for both parties to amend the lawsuit. Then, Shen Zhangshi, aged sixty-one, stated that she lived in Dazhai. "Xiaomei is my daughter." (Question) "Do you know about the lawsuit?" (Answer) "Yes, I know." (Question) "Who was the matchmaker?" (Answer) "The matchmaker is dead." (Question) "How much dowry?" (Answer) "Twenty-four yuan and a pair of gold wire bracelets. Now my daughter doesn't like the son-in-law, who is said to be mentally dull and damaged by infantile convulsions." Liu Lansheng, aged twenty-four, stated that he was now working as a driver. His father was dead and he had an elderly mother at home. The judge said, "Why is your brother so short?" (Answer) "My four brothers developed late, and my brother Aliu, although sixteen years old, was born on the twenty-second day of the twelfth month, so he is still young and somewhat short." The judge said, "The plaintiff requests to terminate the engagement, what are your intentions?" (Answer) "My family doesn't want to terminate the engagement." The judge then asked the plaintiff Shen Xiaomei, "What is your reason for requesting to terminate the engagement? Do you dislike his looks, or do you dislike his illness and find him unattractive?" Xiaomei answered straightforwardly, "I don't like his character. I don't want him. He is sixteen years old now, doesn't do business, and doesn't farm. How will we live in the future?" The judge asked Liu Lansheng, "With your brother's physique, how can he farm?" (Answer) "He doesn't farm. He plans to learn lacquerware in Nanxiang." The judge asked Shen Zhangshi, "Since the matchmaker is dead, who else is there?" (Answer) "There is Shen Haiquan, the son of the male matchmaker. There are no children of the female matchmaker." Then the judge ordered the debate to begin. The lawyers for both parties stood up and debated with each other. The judge ordered both parties to reconcile outside the court. If they could not reconcile, the court would need to summon witnesses again for further hearings. The judge adjourned the court.</p>
<p>Catholic Priests Travel to Sheshan Together</p>
<p>Three hundred female Catholic missionaries from the United States, residing in Shanghai, were scheduled to travel to the Sheshan Catholic Church in Songjiang this morning (the 4th) to pay their respects.

<p>Jing'an Temple's Incense Fair Set Up for Six Days</p>
<p>According to custom, the Shanghai West Jing'an Temple holds a festival on the eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar to celebrate the birth of Sakyamuni Buddha. Many ladies and gentlemen travel to visit, and the number of hawkers and stalls gathered around the temple is quite large. This year, the local police station only allowed the stalls to be set up for two days, causing great panic among the hawkers, who believed that after traveling from afar to do business, such a restriction would inevitably affect their livelihoods. They collectively requested the local Businessmen's Association and the abbot of the temple, Zhifa, to extend the date. Gong Yifei of the Businessmen's Association and Zhifa of the temple personally visited the police chief in charge and negotiated for the hawkers to set up stalls for six days. Therefore, since yesterday, the vendors setting up stalls in the area have been numerous.</p>
<p>Petition to Prohibit Slaughtering on Sakyamuni's Birthday</p>
<p>Wang Yiting and others from the Shanghai World Buddhist Lay Association received a telegram from the Central Engraving Sutra Academy in Peiping, requesting that Chairman Chiang of the National Government issue a nationwide order to prohibit slaughtering in all provinces and cities on May 6th this year, the birthday of Sakyamuni Buddha, as a memorial and to invoke divine harmony. Wang and other lay Buddhists, including Huang Hanzhi and Qu Wenliu, all agreed with the Engraving Sutra Academy's proposal and sent telegrams to the government and the Ministry of Interior requesting approval to do so. The incoming and outgoing telegrams are recorded below. (Incoming telegram) "To Wang Yiting, Ding Fubao, and all fellow members and Buddhist organizations of the World Buddhist Lay Association: We are writing to you regarding the matter of requesting a prohibition on slaughtering for the birthday of Sakyamuni Buddha. Song, Xiong Xiling, Wang Zhixiang, Wan Jun, and others have jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang, the text of which is as follows: 'To Chairman Chiang: Confucius extended benevolence to the people and loved all things equally. Sakyamuni considered all sentient beings to have Buddha-nature equally. Knowing bitterness and joy, Confucianism and Buddhism both possess compassion and mercy, regardless of people or animals. Since the European War, countries around the world have been horrified by the tragedy of killing and have practiced non-violence in hopes of peace. Remembering the sages, Buddhism has become respected throughout the country. Scholars and doctors in East and West have begun to study its philosophy, also because it emphasizes non-killing and benevolence to animals. This year, May 6th is the birthday of Sakyamuni Buddha. Following the tradition of requesting authorities to issue prohibitions on slaughtering, we propose that a telegram be sent to all provinces and cities before the date to prohibit the slaughter of livestock on this day as a memorial to the Buddha, in order to invoke divine harmony above and fulfill the people's wishes below. The sound of benevolence will spread far and wide. We cannot bear to await your command. Relying on your great power and compassionate heart, we hope you will work together to promote its implementation. We have already sent separate telegrams to Jin and Liao Zhang. Central Engraving Sutra Academy, Trap.' (Separate telegrams to the government and the Ministry of Interior) To Chairman Chiang of the Executive Yuan and the Minister of Interior: We believe that misfortune and fortune have no doors, only people invite them themselves. Good and evil feelings and retribution follow like shadows. In recent years, disasters have been reported everywhere, and people have been displaced and died in countless numbers. It is painful to hear and heartbreaking to speak of. The sutras say that people who kill too much cause disasters and calamities, and the anger causes disaster. It is only right to repair the disaster. This month, the 6th is the birthday of Sakyamuni Buddha. Zhu Qinglan, Xiong Xiling, Wang Zhixiang, Wan Jun, and others in Peiping have already telegraphed Chairman Chiang to telegraph all provinces to prohibit slaughtering uniformly on this day. I hope you will consider this and express your sincerity again. I implore your seat to take to heart the virtues of heaven and pity the suffering of the refugees and telegram the whole country to approve the application to prohibit all slaughtering on May 6, the birthday of Sakyamuni Buddha, so that we can rely on benevolence to eliminate disasters and welcome happiness. All beings with feelings are deeply grateful. Jiang, Wang Zhen, Qu Yingguang, Huang Qinglan, Li Yunshu, Guan Tong jointly bow."</p>

<h3>Please Release Rickshaw Licenses, Ministry Approves</h3>
<p>Still Follow the Municipal Government's Instructions</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce previously received a petition from Zheng Limin and others, claiming to be representatives of rickshaw laborers in Shanghai, requesting that the Ministry consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the British Consul in Shanghai to order the Municipal Council to reissue the rickshaw licenses revoked in 1924, because they did not comply with the Municipal Government's instructions. The Ministry has approved the request and ordered that the Municipal Government's instructions be followed. The submittal and six photos are returned herewith. The text of the Ministry's approval, Labor No. 1311, is as follows: "The submittal and attachments have been received. This case was previously submitted by the petitioner, and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government was consulted for investigation and handling. Subsequently, we received a reply stating that the Municipal Council, considering the inconvenience of traffic congestion in the concession, had already decided through a special committee to gradually reduce the number of rickshaws in operation and that there was no possibility of increasing them. Even if there is hope that the Public Concession will return the previously revoked licenses, it should be claimed by the rickshaw merchants who were previously revoked, and not by outsiders. This request can only be formally requested from the Municipal Council by the Huayang Rickshaw Merchants Association and the Rickshaw Workers Mutual Aid Association. The Ministry will not directly negotiate. Therefore, the previous instructions have been issued. Now that the petitioner has submitted again, the representative delegation is instructed to follow the instructions of the Municipal Government. The attachments are returned herewith."</p>

<p>Shi Pinzhi, who ran a clothing store in Yixing, died a few years ago. His wife, Shi Gushi (now thirty-eight years old), had an affair with Dai Hubao, a store employee.

However, Gushi became restless and secretly fled to Shanghai last November, where she became acquainted with Hu Youting and lived with him on Kulun Road, Zhabei, as husband and wife. After Gushi disappeared, Dai came to Shanghai to search for her for several months.

Dai called the police and took her to the First Precinct of the Fourth District. Chief Yao, after learning the details, stated that since the case involved a marriage dispute, he instructed them to prepare a written explanation and submit it to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>University Students Substituted for Catching Adulterers</h3>
<p>Entrusted by Others, Loyal to the Matter</p>
<p>Cao Guangen, a man from Jiangyin, is nearly thirty years old and makes a living by farming in his hometown. Last autumn, he married the daughter of Yuan Xiaolaoguan. However, barely a month into their marriage, their opinions clashed, and they frequently quarreled. Subsequently, Madam Yuan secretly became acquainted with Jiang Longkui, who works in the eyewear business, and eloped to Shanghai to live together. She then wrote to Cao, seeking to end their marital relationship. Cao, feeling aggrieved that he had spent a considerable sum, only for his wife to disappear and leave him with nothing, was filled with anger. He intended to sue his father-in-law at the local government office, but he also didn't know Yuan's whereabouts. He had been searching for months without any news. Unexpectedly, he was recently informed by a friend that Yuan was hiding in Shanghai. He then hired Sun Yinren, a neighbor, to investigate. Sun, a student at Labor University on Jiangwan Road in Shanghai, took on the task and paid attention to the investigation. The other day, he learned that Yuan was residing at 30 Nantao Lane, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei. He then invited his classmate Chen Chuzhao (seventeen years old) to secretly go there that evening. When they arrived, Yuan and her lover Jiang Longkui were just enjoying their time together. Sun, without hesitation, barged in and shouted, "Catch the adulterers!" Yuan was startled by the sound, jumped out of bed, and fled in a frenzy while pulling up her pants, but she managed to escape. They then seized Yuan and handed her over to the police, who took her to the relevant Fourth District Headquarters for questioning. According to Yuan's confession, she was twenty-six years old and had an affair with Jiang because her husband could not support her, which was true. The chief believed that Yuan's abandonment of her husband for an affair was extremely shameless and should be reported to the bureau for verification. He also ordered the arrest of the adulterer Jiang Longkui for interrogation.</p>

Invitations were sent in advance to various sectors of politics, business, academia, and shipping for a tour. Hundreds of guests attended and were received by the company's general manager, assistant manager, and various staff members. The tour included the upper and lower sections, which were richly decorated and of novel design.

<p>Junsheng, whose given name is Junshun, is from Huai'an County, Jiangsu Province. He was a student under the Qing Dynasty. In the first year of the Xuantong reign, the Ministry of Education sent him to study in Japan.

<h3>Presenting a Lawsuit Against China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Claiming Over 5,000 Yuan in Foreign Currency</p>
<p>No One from China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Appeared in Court</p>
<p>A Russian named Koransyivich was hired by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on January 31, 1920. He was assigned to the Jiang'an Steamer as a third-class machinist and worked diligently. He was later promoted to second-class machinist with a monthly salary of 350 yuan. On December 20th last year, when the Russian returned to the Jiang'an ship, he suddenly received a notice from Hua Lansi of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, instructing him to stop working immediately, with his salary paid up to the date of termination, totaling 350 yuan for one month. The Russian, dissatisfied with being dismissed, hired lawyer Wei to file a lawsuit against China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. He argued that China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also followed the contract signed between Taikoo, Jardine and their employees. The contract stipulated that employees who had worked for five years should receive six months of vacation. Therefore, the plaintiff should also receive six months' salary, totaling 2,100 yuan. Additionally, there were four travel tickets, each worth 83 British pounds, with each pound calculated at 19.76 yuan, totaling 3,552 yuan in foreign currency. Therefore, he requested that the defendant be ordered to pay 5,652 yuan and bear the litigation costs. Furthermore, according to regulations, employees must be notified of dismissal at least six months in advance. However, the defendant failed to provide reasonable notice and abruptly dismissed the plaintiff, greatly affecting his reputation and future prospects. The plaintiff has not been able to find another position and cannot find out the reason for his dismissal. Therefore, he requested legal relief and that the defendant compensate for all losses. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang of the Special District Court opened the court and summoned the defendant China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, but no one appeared. After the plaintiff's lawyer and the plaintiff made their statements, Judge Yang stated that the points mentioned in the original statement still needed to be investigated and ordered the hearing to be adjourned to another date.</p>
<p>In the Case of Illegal Sale of Steamer</p>
<h3>Another Joint Fraud Case</h3>
<p>An Tong Company Sues Heng Ping Shareholders</p>
<p>Heng Ping Shipping Company shareholders Tao Tingxuan and Yixing Qianzhuang's Xia Guifang previously hired lawyer E Sen to sue Zheng Liangbin for illegally selling the Da Zhen Steamer, which has been reported in the news after being summoned by the Special District Court. The case is still ongoing, and now another lawsuit related to the case has arisen. The plaintiff is An Tong Company, and the defendants are Heng Ping shareholders Tao Tingxuan, Zheng Liangbin, Chen Zaifeng, Huang Kelian, etc. The plaintiff requests that the defendants be prosecuted for joint fraud and also seeks civil remedies, demanding that the defendants fulfill the contract, deliver the ship, and compensate for losses. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Sun Yuan opened the court for questioning. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, Tao Tingxuan, representing Heng Ping Company, signed a contract with Shao Ying, representing An Tong Company, on February 25th of this year to sell Heng Ping's Da Zhen Steamer for a price of 115,000 taels of silver. Shao paid a deposit of 11,500 taels, with the remaining payment due upon delivery of the ship. All Heng Ping shareholders were present at the signing of the contract, and Zheng Liangbin and Huang Kelian acted as witnesses on the contract. The deposit was collected jointly by Tao Tingxuan and Chen Zaifeng. It was agreed that April 4th would be the delivery date. However, when the date arrived, a dispute suddenly arose among the Heng Ping shareholders, and the Da Zhen Steamer could not be delivered as scheduled. However, the ship price that the plaintiff should find had already been deposited, so letters were repeatedly sent to Tao Tingxuan and Zheng Liangbin urging them to fulfill the contract, but no satisfactory response was received. The plaintiff has suffered losses due to the delay in business, and the defendants are obviously guilty of joint fraud, violating Article 363 of the Criminal Law, etc. All defendants except Zheng Liangbin appeared in court and retained lawyer E Sen for defense. According to Tao's statement, the ship sale contract was signed with An Tong by me as a representative elected by the shareholders. Unexpectedly, when the delivery date arrived, An Tong did not send anyone, so the ship could not be delivered. Chen Zaifeng's statement was the same as Tao's. Tao is the manager, and Heng Ping was established last April with a capital of 40,000 taels. The Da Zhen Steamer was originally purchased for 100,000 taels and then mortgaged to Yixing Qianzhuang, etc. Judge Sun ordered Tao and Chen to each pay a deposit of 10,000 taels and released Huang to be re-examined at a later date.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping a Girl and Meeting Her Uncle on the Way</h3>
<p>The Kidnapper Was Caught on the Spot</p>
<p>Cantonese woman Wang Xiuzhen, aged twenty-six, kidnapped Cao Alian, the twelve-year-old niece of her fellow villager Cao Sen, at 3 PM on the 28th of last month inside Yongji Lane,   Hill Road. She hid her in a house at 133 Shangyu Lane, East Youheng Road. Yesterday, she took Cao to Ren Zhi Lane, North Sichuan Road, intending to sell her. Coincidentally, the girl's uncle, Cao Sen, met her on the way and seized Wang Xiuzhen. He handed her and the girl Alian over to detective Zheng Zhicheng, who detained them at the Hongkou Police Station. The head of the police station ordered them to be escorted to the Special District Court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Young Woman Attempts Suicide After Argument</p>
<p>Zhou Hua, a twenty-nine-year-old young woman from Suzhou, lives at 78 North Wuxi Road. Recently, she often argued with her maternal grandmother because her husband, Zhou Hongsheng, made little money. Although he works at the First Book Market, his income is not enough to cover expenses, so Hua sighed about her unfortunate fate every day. Yesterday afternoon, around 4 PM, she argued with her maternal grandmother again for an unknown reason. She then secretly swallowed a large number of match heads. When her family noticed that her complexion had changed, they reported it to the Zhabei Police Station, and a police car sent her to the hospital for treatment. It is said that if there are no changes within the day, her life can be saved.</p>
<p>Corpse Found at Zhongdao Bridgehead</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 11 AM, Liu Wenli, a patrolman from the Third Police Station of the First District of Nanshi, was patrolling the Zhongdao Bridge area outside Dananmen when he found a man, about thirty years old, wearing clothes and pants given by a charity, resembling a beggar, lying dead there. He immediately returned to the station to report to Section Chief Jin, who, considering it a case of death, immediately ordered the local headman to report to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy. Around 4 PM, Commissioner Li and other inspectors arrived at the scene for an autopsy. It was determined that the nameless male corpse died of illness before his death. Since there were no family members, the local headman was ordered to report to the charity to collect the coffin for burial.</p>

<h3>The Jade Chicken of Mr. Yan Zheng Yimei</h3>
<p>Mr. Yan's actions have been reported in the newspapers. Mr. Li Wenru, a professor at a certain university, once participated in his military plans but disagreed and left in anger. Yesterday, Mr. Li came to chat and mentioned that Mr. Yan studied in a private school when he was young. There was a student who was fierce and strong, and Mr. Yan was often bullied by him. He was very unwilling and wanted to retaliate. One day, he saw the student coming to school with books, wearing a long white cloth shirt. After placing his book box, he took off his long shirt and hung it on a hook. It was still very early, and the teacher had not yet arrived. Taking advantage of the student's unpreparedness, Mr. Yan secretly took his long shirt and put it on. He suddenly grabbed the student on purpose. The student was angry and raised his sleeves to punch him. Mr. Yan immediately lay on the ground. The student then realized that his long shirt had been taken and dirtied by Mr. Yan. He didn't know whether to cry or laugh and soothed him with good words and helped him up. Mr. Yan still smiled and said to him, "Although I am a chicken rib, I am willing to accept your punches. Why stop so quickly?" The student apologized again and again before standing up, but the long shirt was already stained with mud and wrinkled. Mr. Yan secretly rejoiced in his cunning. He has a penchant for dogs, horses, jade, and silk. The year before last, a military officer under him presented a white jade chicken, exquisitely carved with wings spread and eyes glaring, lifelike, with a crimson turban that was a natural color, which was especially lovely. It was said that the object came from the inner palace, was accidentally obtained in the Red Leaf Imperial Moat, and was taken through connections. Mr. Yan treasured it as much as a city and hid it in a box, secretly not showing it to others. One day, it suddenly disappeared. He suspected that it had been stolen by a maid and sentenced her to death. Later, his wife checked the flower rack, and the jade chicken was clearly in sight. In fact, his wife had been playing with it a few days ago, and the object had not been returned to its original place, resulting in this error. At that time, Mr. Yan regretted the maid's rashness, but the person could not be brought back to life, and it was too late.</p>
<h3>A Record of Ms. Zhu Naigeng's Clubbing of Mei</h3>
<p>In recent years, many famous ladies in the North and South like to practice singing and often show their beauty on the red carpet. However, seeking someone with truly profound artistic attainments and excellent acting and singing skills is almost exclusively Ms. Naigeng. Anyone who has ever heard her performance has praised her. Yesterday, Ji Changshi of knowledge</p>
<p>While on the road, if you want to make a phone call, you can confidently walk into banks and other large stores and dial the phone. If you smile respectfully and say to the clerks of the bank and other large stores, "Excuse me, sir, may I borrow the phone?" they will definitely refuse and suffer their cold stares.</p>
<p>When taking a bus or tram for a long distance, you should run to the back of the car and not stand at the entrance so that it will not be crowded.</p>
<p>When buying things at pharmacies and bookstores, you should write down the names of the items on paper to avoid misunderstandings due to different dialects, which can cause a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>In places where many people gather on the road</p>
<p>Be sure not to go to see the excitement to avoid unnecessary disasters.</p>
<p>When walking on the road, you must keep your mouth closed to prevent dust and infectious germs from entering. If you can keep your tongue against your teeth and breathe through your nose, you can greatly strengthen yourself and prevent disease. Secret of Zou Bing</p>
<p>The Chengping People's Hospital held a charity performance of the first stage play, which was a grand success. She was invited to perform the entire play of Clubbing of the Fool. Ms. Naigeng played Jin Yunü with a beautiful appearance and graceful demeanor, like a pitiful little girl from a humble family. When she first saw Mo Ji, she was shy and led him home to feed him, her eyebrows showing pity. Her father agreed to the marriage, and she was surprised and delighted. It can be said that there was sound and color everywhere. During the clubbing scene, she sat silently on the edge of the bed, her quiet and dignified demeanor was no longer that of a little girl. At this time, she has boundless tenderness and a heart of complaint but not anger. The words "heartless man" come out of her mouth, making people feel sad and heartbroken. Her Beijing dialect is clear and fluent, and her expressions are delicate and thoughtful, just like writing the Yellow Court Classic for the first time, perfectly capturing the essence. This play is not easy to perform. Jin Yunü is a girl from a humble family but is quite dignified. If the expressions are too excessive, she will inevitably lose her charm. If they are not enough, she will be too stiff. The actress Yan Qilan performed this the best. On this day, Wu Fengchun, played by Ms. Naigeng, and Wu Yuehua, played by Jin Song, were both excellent.</p>
<h3>The Oddity of Fish and Birds in Burial Chambers</h3>
<p>A guest came from Jiangdu and described that in a large household named Gu outside the South Gate of Yangzhou, four coffins of parents, elder brother, and sister-in-law had not been buried. They were bewitched by the words of feng shui masters and had not been able to find a burial site for more than ten years. The old cemetery was not small, but four people died in succession within three years, so it was considered unlucky. They waited for a good location, and even the coffins of the great-grandparents and grandparents who had been buried for a long time had to be relocated. It was heard that they finally found a burial site in the winter of the year before last. In February of this spring, they held a grand burial ceremony. According to the words of the feng shui master, they opened the main cave to a depth of one zhang and two chi as prescribed. Before they reached one zhang, a pair of small birds, similar to quails, flew upwards and soared straight into the clouds. All who saw it were shocked. After opening it less than a chi, clear springs gurgled, and two red carp, about five or six inches long, swam in it. The owner of the Gu family ordered them to be taken out and kept in the family pond. The pond was large, with an area not much smaller than a backyard planted with lotuses. Recently, people often went to watch the two red carp. Sometimes they hid below, and sometimes they swam on the surface of the pond. The ignorant villagers fell into pure superstition and judged good and bad fortune by whether they could see them or not. Later, the Gu family, unable to bear the disturbance, declined visitors, saying that the red carp had also disappeared. On that day, the feng shui master fell ill and ordered his son to inspect the site on his behalf. The discovery of fish and birds was debated by many, who said that the qi had been leaked and that it was a pity. I said that this was still superstition and not worth mentioning. However, the fact that there were fish and birds in the ground, deeply hidden and closed off, how could they survive and where did they come from? All of these are oddities. Therefore, I narrated it in the hope that science could study it.</p>
<h3>The Studious Female Star, Langhua</h3>
<p>Domestic films in the past two years can be described as extremely dull. However, several female stars with artistic talent have emerged in this dull era, and Ms. Wang Feijuan is one of them. When she was studying, she had a strong interest in film. In the autumn of last year, she abandoned her alma mater and entered Xifan Film Company as a basic actress. Her movements and performances have been highly valued by the company's directors Hu Zongli and Chen Zhuomin. Her first role was a romantic woman. She can not only use her face to perform flirtatiously but also use her heart to perform, which is the most commendable. Therefore, people in the film industry call her the "Oriental Clara Bao." Now that martial arts films are popular at home and abroad, she has also learned martial arts and, surprisingly, has become very proficient in less than two months.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes in Southeast Asia (23)</h3>
<p>1.  With human life as the center, therefore not using nationalism to destroy countries (patriotic movements are only a matter of the last thirty years).</p>
<p>2.  With all humanity as the center, therefore not using one to destroy another. Assimilation of 400 million races.</p>
<p>3.  With living people as the center, therefore, the foolishness of war for ghosts and gods will never arise (Chinese gods are just literary materials for scholars and unreleased worries for women).</p>
<p>4.  With the body and spirit as the center, therefore, the foolishness of sacrificing for emotionless material things will not arise.</p>
<p>5.  Loving one's relatives and then loving the people, and then loving things. Therefore, the customs of Egyptians worshiping cows and cats and Indians worshiping insects are not prevalent.</p>
<p>6.  With human compassion and conscience as the center, therefore, not emphasizing the hegemonic method of laws.</p>
<p>7.  With loyalty and tolerance, this heart and this principle as the center, therefore, not emphasizing equality, and the distance is naturally not far.</p>
<p>Analyzing its origin, ancient China used Yao and Shun as teachings, and later used the three religions as teachings. The three religions of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism's Guanyin compassion and Taoist purity and longevity are all evaluated by Westerners as anarchism. Confucius' governance is based on virtue and non-action, which is also half anarchism. Therefore, there have been very few tyrannical rulers since ancient times. This national culture, if it wants to implement authoritarian communism, will become a pagoda built on the sand and will collapse naturally regardless. Wilson's Fourteen Points, which shook the world, are not more than the usual talk of reviving extinct countries and continuing the lineage of severed families. What is so strange? As for Yao and Shun's abdication, it is the Buddha's giving. President Klíve's avoidance of struggle is the common rule of Datong.</p>
<p>From the above complete comparison, the world does its best in one direction and acts for oneself and acts as a person. The center of morality and peace in the twentieth century is not to save a country, but to save all countries. This is the treasure raft to Datong. My five thousand years of ancestors left a great treasure for their descendants. Do you young people know it? If you know it, can you also promote it? If you act, can you continue to work hard? Wang Yangming's poem, "Abandoning one's own inexhaustible treasure, going from door to door begging, like a poor child, alas!" Although empty words are of no use, what is the scientific method in this scientific age? You can try to talk about it. There is no need to talk too much. Read the Outline and Principles of Shenhua Datong Federation to use the latest invention of physiological electrical science to complete the road to Datong. This is the true value of the culture of my Yellow Emperor's descendants and the Great Chinese, the heaven's vocation of my quarter of the world's people, the Chinese people, especially the youth. Do not fail.</p>
<p>Long live the new Chinese culture!</p>
<p>Long live the realization of global Datong!</p>
<p>She is already very skilled. She often says to people that the camera is her lover. She wants to embrace celibacy and live this lovely silver screen life forever. In her spare time, she still studies with her former classmates until 12 o'clock every night. Who can despise a woman who makes movies like this?</p>
<h3>Flea Kills Jun Mei</h3>
<p>Fleas are extremely small things that were not originally able to kill people. However, fleas are often the medium for plague and malaria. If the fleas recorded here kill people, it is a different story.</p>
<p>Zhang, who lives next door, is no longer confused. He has the habits of a celebrity, and his clothes, shoes, and socks have not changed for years. When asked, he will answer with the two sentences: "Making garbage is like making a Bodhisattva." His bedroom is especially dirty, and books and newspapers are piled up like mountains. The bedclothes and sheets are as black as paint, and there are many fleas. Zhang is not bothered by it. Whenever he gets something, he immediately puts it in his mouth. Now, he suddenly gets sick and feels itchy all day long, and sometimes it hurts. At first, he didn't know that his life was at stake. However, his face was yellow and thin, his spirit was declining, his flesh was bloodless, and he hated eating. Then, a large tumor appeared on his throat, shaped like a small ball, and it grew larger day and night, and his whole body was unbearably painful. Friends or persuaded him to cut it off, but Zhang stubbornly held his own opinion and was deceived by Confucius's false theory that "the body and hair are received from parents and cannot be destroyed." Those who advised him were rejected, and finally the tumor became as big as a bowl, and he could not eat and died. The curious asked his family to break the bag and look at it, and they found that there were faint, thin fleas in the blood. Then they knew that Zhang had caught fleas in his mouth or that they had entered his abdomen and brewed this strange disease.</p>
<p>Those who catch fleas often put them in their mouths because they are not easy to escape. How can they know that the harm is so great that it is unexpected? Zhang can be a lesson.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (1)(8)(3) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter Ten: Crimson Flames Soar, The Pavilion Praises Filial Daughters, Red Carpet Spreads, Meeting Famous Performers</p>
<p>At that time, a friend in the banking circle, who was a valiant member of the Mei Lanfang support group when he was in Beijing, and strongly advocated for Mei Lanfang, bravely said, "Let's go try it out. Fortunately, we're hosting a private performance, not a public sale, so there's no conflict with their theaters. It's just inviting guests for the day to see Mei Lanfang's superb talent. When their official opening comes, many people will book seats in advance. This will not only not harm them but also benefit them!" Liu Yinbo was naturally very happy that there would be a private performance by Mei Lanfang that day. He said, "If I discuss it with the theater boss, I have a relative who knows him. Please ask him to give up one day, or we'll just pay him a little money. I'll take care of this matter." That friend in the financial world thought it wasn't necessary to go to such lengths. The play was to be sung by Mei Lanfang, and it would be better to talk directly to Mei Lanfang. This was his first time coming to Shanghai, and he naturally wanted to show off and make connections with some famous people in Shanghai to support him. If we talk to him, he won't refuse. He was originally afraid to come to Shanghai. His reputation in Beijing was already excellent, but Shanghai was different. He wasn't sure how Shanghai people would react. He's a timid and cautious person. If he came to Shanghai and hit a snag, it would be a bit boring for him to go back. That's why he hesitated when the theater went to pick him up. It was us who gave him courage, saying, 'Don't worry, we've got you covered. You definitely won't fail. Things in Shanghai are easier to handle than in Beijing. Firstly, there are fewer people in Shanghai who understand opera, but they like novelty and excitement. Shanghai people have a so-called 'herd mentality.' As long as a few people say it's good, everyone echoes and says it's good, but they can't explain exactly where it's good. We just need to influence a few wealthy families in Shanghai, and they will naturally come to join in the fun, especially the wives, young ladies, and concubines. They have nothing to do in the evenings, and watching opera is the best and most economical pastime. Otherwise, they would just while away the time at home playing mahjong, or even going out to gamble. I heard that there's some kind of women's club in Shanghai that's exclusively for women to gamble in, and the stakes are very high. So, rather than losing thousands in women's gambling dens, it's better to watch opera every night. So, if they rent a box, they'll rent it for several weeks in a row. Shanghai people have plenty of money and don't care about the cost. However, they like novelty, so you need to have a few new plays and change the repertoire often, don't always perform those old plays that they're tired of watching."</p>

<h3>No Major Changes in Gold Standard</h3>
<p>The gold market in the city fluctuated slightly yesterday, with the psychological state of those in the industry appearing weak, preventing prices from continuing to reach new peaks. Prices hovered around 506 taels, with a fluctuation of only about two taels. The exchange rate remained stable, with banks absorbing some of the supply. Buyers and sellers in the market were largely balanced. Traders such as the Dalian gang, Zhi Feng, Yong Yuan Mao, Yong Xiang Yu, and others were buying and selling intermittently. Speculative traders were not very active. The morning market opened slightly higher, likely due to continued shrinkage of large ingots. As the number of sellers increased, the market immediately weakened. There was a fluctuation of a tael or so, with each firm engaging in tentative buying and selling. The final price was 505 taels and 67 cents, not far from yesterday's closing price. The market was closed in the afternoon due to the customary Saturday closure.</p>
<p>The highest price reached 6 taels and 7 cents at 11:00. Both London silver bars and silver prices fell again by one-eighth. The initial opening price for the June gold standard was 506 taels and 3 cents, a gross increase of 6 cents, gradually decreasing by 1 tael and 45 cents. Subsequently, due to the normal exchange rate, Mitsui bought forward Japanese gold at 1 tael and 5 cents, and the British gold price of 11 pence and 1875 shillings was quoted at 504 taels and 8 cents. The quoted price remained unchanged, with the internal rate remaining stable. However, Mitsui absorbed near-term British gold at 11 pence and 625 cents, and the Dalian gang slightly increased its buying, raising the price to 5 taels and 56 cents. Shortly after, the price dropped by 5 or 6 cents. After 10:00, the price seemed to rise again. Mitsui bought forward Japanese gold at 1 tael and 5 cents, and Zhejiang bought May British gold at 11 pence and 625 cents. Furthermore, Japanese banks aggressively purchased ingots, and short sellers covered their positions, causing the price to exceed 6 taels. However, general scalpers took the opportunity to sell, and long positions also sold. The price of Japanese gold seemed to weaken, leading to a drop of more than one tael in a short period. By 11:30, the price was only 4 taels and 9 cents. It then rebounded slightly by 7 or 8 cents. The exchange rate stabilized. The closing price for near-term Japanese gold was 1 tael and 6125 cents, and the forward price was 5125 cents. The May British gold price was 11 pence. The closing price at noon was 505 taels and 6 cents, a decrease of only 1 cent compared to the 2nd.</p>
<p>The pressing price was about 10 taels lower. The highest price in the half-day was 506 taels and 7 cents, and the lowest price was 504 taels and 8 cents, a difference of 1 tael and 9 cents. The quoted price remained at 515 taels and 4 cents, requiring a reduction of about 10 taels. The registered prices were 08 taels for May, 06 taels for June, and 08 taels for water replenishment. The opening price for physical goods was 6 taels and 1 cent, and the closing price was 5 taels and a half.</p>
<p>The Dalian gang's activity was unpredictable. Among the industry buyers and sellers, Yuan Xing Yong, Sen Chang Yong, Yong Cheng Chang, Yuan Kang Xiang, Wan Xing, and others were all sellers. Fu Chang, Yuan Yu Yong, Shun Li, Yuan Cheng, Chun Fa Yong, Fu Yu, Yuan Cheng Yong, and others were all buyers. Heng Xing, Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Xiang Yu, Yuan Tai, and others had fluctuating activity. The Dalian gang bought over 2,000 ingots and sold 1,300 to 1,400 ingots. The Guangdong gang waited for the right time to act, and only a few head-to-head ingots were bought and sold.</p>
<p>Only Half-Day Trading During Spring Race Period This month, the 5th, 6th, and 7th (next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) will be the Western merchants' spring racing period. Banks usually work half-days. Therefore, the Gold Exchange will open at 8:30 AM and close at 11:30 AM on these three days. There will be no business in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Dull Foreign Exchange Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Saturday, the foreign exchange market was only open for half a day as usual. The silver markets in England, America, India, and other countries continued to shrink. The market was calm. The Yokohama market showed a slight increase, while Kobe remained stagnant. There were no good or bad news from the morning and noon telegrams. The HSBC list prices for all exchanges were no different from the previous day. Bank trading was not as active as the day before, with only a few trades. The market was quite peaceful. Although there was a fluctuation of more than one tael in the gold standard, the exchange rate changes were minimal. Chinese speculators did not take action. It was estimated that 40,000 to 50,000 pounds of British gold were sold by gold dealers. Mitsui and Zhejiang Industrial had some appetite, but there were very few closing transactions. Banks did a few tens of thousands of pounds against each other, and tens of thousands of dollars of Citibank were also traded. Chinese merchants sold more than 100,000 yuan, which was absorbed by Sumitomo Mitsui. Only a few hundred thousand yuan of Japanese gold were traded, with only Mitsui buying. The Dalian gang sold a little to hedge gold. By the time the market closed at noon, the exchange rates were similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>British and American Silver Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegram, the price of large silver ingots continued to fall, with the near-term price decreasing by 125 to 19 pence and 375 (equivalent to 1 shilling and 10 pence and 9375 cents). The forward price also decreased by 125 to 19 pence and 3125. China sold off, and buyers watched, stabilizing the market. A telegram from New York reported that the price of American silver spot again fell by 125 to 4 and 2125 cents. The exchange rate of British to American dollars decreased by 09375 to 4 dollars and 8609375 cents. The exchange rate of American to British pounds fell by 125 to 4 dollars and 860625 cents. The rate of Japanese to American dollars remained at 49 dollars and 375 cents. The British to English rate remained at 2 shillings and 040625 cents. The Shanghai to London rate decreased by 0625 to 1 shilling and 11 pence and 1875 cents. The Bombay rate decreased by 1 rupee to 55 rupees. At 11:45 am, Reuters telegrams all showed increases. The rate of Japanese to American dollars increased by 0625 to 49 dollars and 375 cents. The rate of British to English rate increased by 03125 to 2 shillings and 0375 cents.

<p>The interest rate dropped by 1.5%.</p>
<p>Over 1 cent interest on overnight loans.</p>
<p>General Market Situation: The financial market atmosphere always cools down after a major payment period. The current situation of the previous days has followed the old pattern, resulting in sluggishness. The interest rate in the market suddenly dropped by 1.625% for every 100. The overnight loan rate exceeded 1 cent, likely due to the busy use of funds during the silkworm season. The market conditions for other auxiliary coins were generally similar to the previous few days.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices (Foreign Interest Rate): The early market was 7 cents, 2 points, 08 hao, 7 hu, half, a decrease of 7 hao and a half compared to the previous day's early market. The noon market further decreased by 875 to 7 cents and 2 points. This situation is likely caused by the crowding of incoming goods. (Silver Interest Rate): The overnight transfer rate suddenly exceeded 1 cent and 2 points, an increase of 3 points compared to the previous day. The noon silver interest rate was 1 cent, with no increase throughout the day.</p>
<p>Circulating Coin Market: The early and noon prices for Jiangsu small foreign coins were both 6 cents, 2 points, and 9 li. 3,000 angles were traded in the early market, and 2,000 angles were traded in the noon market.

Copper coins increased again by 1,500 yuan to 396,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Government Bonds: Sharper Downturn</h3>
<p>More Than 7.6 Million in Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the local securities market, trading of various bonds was minimal. Only 15,000 yuan of spot goods were traded. The futures market was quite active in the morning, with transactions reaching over 4.8 million yuan. The market gradually quieted down in the afternoon, with only over 2.8 million yuan traded. Customs duty bonds were the most active, accounting for over 2.6 million yuan, far exceeding the previous 1.6 million yuan. Rehabilitation bonds also accounted for 1.5 million yuan, and Reorganization bonds accounted for about 900,000 yuan. Other bonds were relatively calm. Due to the tense political situation and the unavoidable war in the Central Plains, the market was weak and supply exceeded demand. Prices fell across the board, with Regular Six bonds falling the most, about 2 yuan. Customs duty and Reorganization bonds also fell by about 1 yuan. Other bonds only fell by about 5 to 6 jiao, an insignificant amount. The bond market situation has changed compared to before.</p>

<h3>Yarn, Flower, and Silk Markets: Listless and Spiritless</h3>
<p>The yarn market is listless due to many rumors regarding the political situation and sluggish actual sales. People's minds are trending towards lower prices, and sellers are pressing to sell. However, a certain factory's long position remains unchanged. In short, actual sales are weak, and the production period is at its peak. It is difficult for prices to rise during the order period. Therefore, small investors are unanimously shorting the market. No one is sure about the future.</p>
<p>Both Near and Far Term Yarn Fell. US Cotton Prices Fell in Advance. The market opened, and US cotton prices fell again. Dafenghao sold 250 bales each month for the next three months, causing a sudden drop of 5 to 6 qian. The situation was extremely weak for a time. Then, small investors covered their short positions, and the market rebounded by 2 to 3 qian. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, and the far month fell by 2 to 3 qian. The market was even more sluggish in the afternoon, and the market atmosphere was scattered. Rixin Yangxing purchased the current month and sold the far month. As a result, the current month fell by 3 to 4 qian, and the far month fell by 1 to 25 qian. Total trading volume for the day was 7,600 bales. However, a telegram regarding the closing price of third-grade yarn showed that the price had rebounded by 2 to 3 yuan. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>| Brand | Closing Price | Change | Balance |</p>

<p>Spot Yarn Sales: Flat. Total purchases by various gangs were 1,230 bales. 175 bales were traded among peers. The market was flat. Guangdong purchased the most, 570 bales. Other purchases included 150 bales by Sichuan, 55 bales by Niuzhuang, 288 bales by Yunnan, 30 bales by Tianjin, 30 bales by Wuhu, 50 bales by Xiamen, and 70 bales by Miscellaneous Gangs.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market: Increasingly Bleak</h3>
<p>Downstream Foreign Markets...Actual Demand Stopped.</p>
<p>The cotton market suddenly weakened, with a slight increase in the price decline, mainly due to the decline in US cotton prices. The practice of shorting Dong cotton and longing the far month was quite unusual. Therefore, most small investors sold the current month and purchased the far month, similar to Japanese merchants. However, the attitude of the Han gang remained firm. Since the spot cotton business was stagnant, it was difficult to predict the market. The Japanese merchants entered the near month and exited the far month. Before the Han Standard market opened, foreign cotton prices declined slightly, weakening confidence, and prices in each month fell by 5 cents to 2 qian. The situation was calm in the afternoon. The near month was relatively weak, while the far month remained strong. The total transaction volume for the day was 16,800 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>| Brand | Closing Price | Change | Balance |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>

<h3>Fluctuations in Overseas Yarn and Cotton Markets</h3>
<p>The prices of American cotton are increasingly diverging between old and new crops. Initially, US cotton prices weakened due to favorable weather and unfavorable news from Liverpool. Later, prices rebounded due to some short covering. The futures price fell by 8 to 11 pounds, and the spot price fell by 10 pounds. The British cotton futures price fell by 12 to 16 points, and the spot price fell by 13 points. The Egyptian cotton spot price fell by 15 points. Indian cotton prices initially fell slightly following US cotton prices, but later rebounded slightly due to purchases by Japanese merchants. The near and far terms of Pingguoer fell by one rupee, Aomula fell by two rupees, the far term fell by three rupees, Bairoxi fell by two rupees, and the far term fell by three rupees.

<h3>The US Cotton Market Rebounded Last Week</h3>
<p>The Carryover of Old Cotton Increased by One Million Bales This Season</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 2nd reported on the cotton market during the week: "The cotton market experienced a sharp rebound last week. The announcement for May revealed that it would continue to absorb the goods delivered to the Cotton Exchange. The total amount delivered in New York as of the closing date the day before yesterday was nearly 260,000 bales. Since the cooperative's announcement to stop, the short covering by the industry followed. Currently, the price difference between new and old cotton is increasing, as the states of Western Texas and Oklahoma have both received rain, and the worries about the start of new cotton can be put behind us. Private reports indicate that cotton exports have decreased by about 42%. The industry's opinion is that the global consumption of US cotton will decrease to about 1.38 million bales. It is expected that the carryover of old cotton at the end of this season will increase by one million bales." The weekend statistics are attached below (in thousands of bales).</p>

<h3>Stagnation in Silk and Tea Markets Both at Home and Abroad</h3>
<p>The local foreign bank silk market is facing a crisis. European and American markets have ample supplies of silk, and silk sales are sluggish. Japanese silk stocks also amount to 70,000 to 80,000 bales, and silk prices are falling daily. Overseas silk reports are not being forwarded. Although Chinese silk merchants are willing to sell at low prices, there are no buyers. The silk markets at home and abroad are both trending towards stagnation. As new silkworm cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang are about to enter the market, manufacturers are unable to maintain operations and are announcing closures one after another. The silk industry's crisis lacks a solution.</p>
<h3>The Shaoxing Cocoon Market May Be Difficult to Improve</h3>
<p>Poor Weather Affects the Zou Cocoon Crop. Sluggish Silk Sales. Silk Merchants Remain Watchful. Farmers in various counties under the jurisdiction of the old Shaoxing prefecture, such as Zhuji and Xiaoshan, have all engaged in silkworm incubation this year. However, the weather has been unstable after the flower harvest, and the weather has remained unfavorable until the most important period for the big sleep of silkworm ants. Continuous overcast and rainy weather has made the climate cold, and the silkworms have been eating wet leaves and developing diseases. In addition, their growth is uneven. Currently, the early silkworms are ready, and the late ones are only in the big sleep. It is difficult to expect a bountiful cocoon harvest in the future. Due to the unrest caused by bandits, few cocoon businesses have been rented out in various districts. Now, because the silk sales in Europe and America are sluggish, the silk mills' new cocoon futures are being sold off, and silk merchants are watching the purchase of new cocoons with a wait-and-see attitude. It is only natural that the cocoon market is difficult to improve.</p>
<h3>New Developments in the Wuyuan Tea Market</h3>
<p>Tunchi Tea Company Ordered Pre-Grain Rain Tea. New Prices Opened at 80 Yuan Per Dan. Five New Companies Added.</p>
<p>Quick News from Wuyuan, April 27: The green tea in the northeast township of Wuyuan is of high quality and has always been valued by foreign merchants. In recent years, sales have been smooth and prices have been high. There is very little old tea left in Shanghai, so Road Tea companies have turned to the Wuyuan tea market. Although Russian companies stopped operations midway last year, Wuyuan tea, except for Gongxi, has not been affected in any way. This year, all the tea companies in the county are still opening as usual. In addition to the Beixiang Shantai, Gaoan, and Xintian Chengji companies near Wuyuan City, the new Huangni Cen in Kaoshui Beixiang has added three new companies and is preparing to enter the market. In addition, the tea companies have recently received telegrams from Shanghai stating that the Russian companies are starting to handle Gongxi tea and have already ordered it by telegram, which has given the market a boost. However, the tea companies' need for tea money has resulted in a shortage of supplies from Leping, Jingzhen, and Tunxi, and they are all buying from merchants and shops here. Yesterday, the ticket price had already surged to over 1,350 yuan. It is rumored that Tunchi tea companies have sent personnel to the area north of Wuyuan to order new tea harvested and produced before Grain Rain due to the poor tea production in Huizhou. The price opened at 80 yuan, and the mountain households are all keeping their goods. The Wuyuan tea companies have no choice but to follow the market and raise prices. It is expected that there will be a stalemate between the opening price and the actual harvest price of the new tea.</p>
<h3>The Grain and Rice Markets Are Stagnant and Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday, over ten boats from various gangs arrived in Zhabei. Sales were sluggish in the morning and only slightly improved at noon. The market was stagnant. The price of high-grade Beigeng rice was lowered. However, the transactions of newly arrived Zhongguan rice were good, and the market price was stable. No one cared about the long-shelved Ergeng rice, and the prices were still low. The price of Bo Rice was flat due to</p>
<h3>Powder Market Rebounds Slightly in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening price for this month's powder market was as low as 2.4375 taels, but it has since stabilized slightly. Therefore, not only do those shorting the market have to rush to cover their positions, but also the spot sales group believes the price is reasonable, so everyone is buying. Moreover, the inventory in Tianjin is dwindling day by day. If it falls further, the demand may turn from stagnant to prosperous. It is inappropriate for speculators to disregard everything and frequently dump goods before the market reaches that point. By the afternoon opening, due to the heavy rain, the inland buyers became more stable-minded, and those covering short positions for both near and distant delivery dates were also eager. Therefore, the opening price was better than the morning by one cent. After that, each board showed a hovering trend. Observing the situation next week, if customer sales remain good, this market may actually stabilize. As a result, this month's price was up 7.5 li compared to the previous day, June was up 2.5 li, July and August were up 5 li, September was unchanged, and October was up 5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Entirely Depends on the Weather for Change</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening price of the wheat futures market in the morning saw a decline. June was as low as 4.45 taels, July was 4.35 taels, August was 4.39 taels, and September was 4.47 taels, down two to three cents from the previous day's closing price. However, at the afternoon opening, it was still stable at first, but then it continued to rain, and the flour also rose slightly, causing people's hearts to revive. Each futures month rebounded. Observing the situation from now on, because most of the wheat is currently in the flowering stage, it is not suitable for prolonged rain. If it can turn sunny, the market can turn to a stable state. As a result, June was up one cent from the previous day, while July and September were down one cent. August and October were unchanged. Currently, the wheat market's factory appetite is still good, and the price remains stable. Hunan wheat opened at 4.5 to 4.7 cents, Shashi wheat at 4.5 to 4.9 cents, Shaoxing wheat at 4.77 cents, Hankou wheat at 4.4 to 4.29 cents, and Qingjiang wheat at 4.92 to 4.99 cents. A total of 14,000 bags were opened, purchased by Fuxin, Shenda, and other factories.</p>
<h3>Hardware English Steel Plate Exclusively Sells at 7.5 Li</h3>
<p>The 7.5 li English steel plate, which has been out of stock for a long time, has recently begun to arrive in succession from various ports in Bell City, England, causing colleagues who have been waiting for this item to collect and purchase it. The amount of transactions is the highest among all goods. The opening price is 6.5 taels per picul, up 1.5 cents from the previous day. In addition, 2.5 li and 0.5 li are also popular, but there are fewer buyers. As for 1 li and above, in addition to a slight embellishment by the factory, there are few customers who take action.</p>

<h3>Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>The World Book Company proclaims that in recent years, the World Book Company in Shanghai has been the most planned, systematic, and well-organized publisher. Therefore, the books published by our company are popular nationwide and enduring. Recently, our company has also published a series of books on life, which is especially systematic. The editors and authors are all first-class celebrities, such as Xue Deyu, Zhu Zhaocui, Hu Jichen, Qiu Jingni, Sha Yuyan, and dozens of others, who are either professors or principals. The series is organized into several sections: (1) The lives of Chinese and foreign celebrities; (2) The lives of animals and plants and daily scientific life; (3) The lives of various countries, etc. The editing method focuses on interest. For example, the biographies of characters adopt the biography literary style that is most popular in the West, vividly narrating events and overflowing with interest. Compared with reading novels, it is not only beneficial but also more interesting. Moreover, the writers are selected from those who love and study the subjects on weekdays, so each book is not a forced creation but a creation of the writers. For example, Principal Xue of Zhenjiang Middle School, who compiled "The By-products of Life: Urine, Farts, and Poop," claimed that the book could be dedicated to parents, which is evident. Recently, the National Education Conference has decided to award and encourage the publication of popular science books. The series contains many books on the lives of animals and plants and daily scientific life, which can be said to be in line with the trend of the times. At a time when everyone feels that life is dry and tasteless, the publication of the series of books on life is truly meaningful and will undoubtedly be loved not only by students but also by the general public.</p>

<p>The Dan Gui No. 1 Stage Troupe is presenting a new four-act opera, "Heaven-Shaking and Earth-Shattering," with the following synopsis: The Bodhisattva of the South Sea, seeing that the Purple Star’s sixteen years of hardship are over and Emperor Xuan’s reign is waning, instructs Wei Tuo to bestow a flower basket and golden bowl as a marriage token for Zheng Jinlian in the West Palace. The Immortal Maiden Li, because Li Wenlong plotted to harm Su Jindin using the suppressing town map, feels that the grievances are complete. Fearing heavenly retribution if she does not retrieve the map, she enters the palace, retrieves the map, and burns it. The ten bewitching妖 women successively leave the palace. Emperor Xuan, having been bewitched by these women, spends his days in a daze. Xin, the Consort Miao, harms loyal officials and is insatiably greedy, leading to a serious illness. Only Zhang Guiying, the princess of the East Palace, tends to her day and night, brewing medicine. Consort Miao, seeing Emperor Xuan’s grave illness and her close relationship with Li Wenlong, is persuaded by the wicked servant Diao Yuan to plot to seize the throne while Xuan is dying and peacefully ascend the throne to rule from behind the curtain. Who knew that after Emperor Xuan was sick, his spirit recovered and he was able to personally handle state affairs and not listen to Consort Miao's advice. Tiger Jingwen tried to save his mother but was almost captured by Miao Kuan. Fortunately, he was saved by a deity and escaped to the wilderness. Wei Tuo enlightened a woodcutter and bestowed a flower basket and golden bowl as a marriage token for Zheng Xiangfu. A group of beggar children saw the dragon jade and phoenix flying away in the wind, and fearing disaster, they fled to Xianyang together, where they encountered Tiger Jingwen, fellow sufferers in distress, and continued to be diners under the eaves. Miao Kuan chased back Su Jindin and Miao Jun. Miao Jun, moved by righteousness, bitterly scolded Miao Kuan for his inhumane actions. Miao Kuan, seeing his grandson favoring outsiders, drew his sword and was about to kill him when he imprisoned Su Jindin in a prison cart to be escorted to the capital to harm Zhang Guiying. He also ordered his nephew Miao Weiyi and his wife to return to the capital to be dismissed from their posts and serve the emperor in order to increase the power of the Miao family. Zheng Jinlian dreamed of a divine being who pointed out that Prince Liu Wener, i.e., Tiger Jingwen, was destined to marry her and later achieve high rank and enter the West Palace. Zheng Feiran then requested to retire to the countryside. One day, the Grand Preceptor hosted a birthday banquet for Zheng, inviting guests and setting up a feast to celebrate. The beggar children and the prince sang and offered birthday wishes, and the prince greatly pleased Zheng Feiran, who rewarded him with wine, meat, gold, and silver. The prince, drunk, mistakenly entered the Zheng mansion's garden and fell asleep drunk in the shade of a tree. Zheng Jinlian, recalling the words of the divine being, believed it to be true and ordered the maid Qiu Sha to go to the garden to burn incense and pray. She saw a golden dragon appearing in the shade of the tree and was greatly frightened. After calming down and taking a closer look, she saw a transformed man sleeping drunk under the tree and then asked the madam to inquire. She then knew that he was the prince in distress, and secretly kept him in the mansion and ordered him to study. Su Sheng and Su Xing, following the orders of Wan Lin and Wan Feng, went to inquire about the court's return to the mountains and happened to meet Miao Kuan escorting Su Jindin to the capital. Passing by Tai Mang Mountain, Su Sheng and Su Xing flew on horseback to report to the mountain stronghold. Wan Lin and Wan Feng killed Miao Kuan and hijacked the cart. The siblings met and shared their hardships. Miao Kuan captured Su Jindin, hoping to escort her to the capital to harm Zhang Guiying in revenge for being slapped in the face years ago. Who knew that he would meet his enemies along the way and have the cart hijacked. Fortunately, he escaped with his life, and then led Miao Weiyi and his wife in a fit of anger to the capital to file a report. Emperor Xuan ordered the suppression of Tai Mang Mountain. One day, Emperor Xuan ascended the palace and conferred titles on his ministers. Suddenly, he thought of the State Duke Su and asked his ministers, who all said that the entire Su family had been sentenced to death by the Emperor’s decree more than ten years ago. Emperor Xuan asked about the crime for which they were to be executed. Lin Ying replied that Princess Zhang of the East Palace knew the details. Emperor Xuan asked Zhang Guiying of the East Palace in detail, but she still did not dare to tell the truth, but said that Lady Su wanted to harm the emperor’s life with the suppressing town map, and then she produced the prince, who died upon landing. The emperor strangled her three times and killed her. Only because of Lady Su's crime did the entire Su family suffer a tragic death. Emperor Xuan thought that the Su family had been loyal for generations and should not be implicated for one person's crime. He regretted that he did not investigate carefully and mistakenly killed loyal officials. At that time, Miao Kuan entered the palace to ask for an imperial decree, saying that Wan Lin and Wan Feng had become bandits on Tai Mang Mountain and asked the emperor to send troops to suppress them. At this time, Emperor Xuan intended to pardon Wan Lin and Wan Feng and summon them back to the court to grant them official positions in order to comfort the loyal souls. He hated Miao Kuan for meddling again and scolded him severely. Zhang Guiying saw an opportunity to advise Emperor Xuan to order the execution of Miao Kuan. The Xuan Emperor could not bear to expel Miao Kuan from the palace. Consort Miao saw that Emperor Xuan did not listen to her advice and did not go to the West Palace, but summoned Li Wenlong into the palace to continue his pleasure. Consort Miao saw that Emperor Xuan intended to pardon Wan Lin and Wan Feng, fearing that it would be unfavorable to her, and hurriedly went to the West Palace, where she happened to meet Consort Miao and Li WuLong talking secretly. She hurriedly explained the matter to Consort Miao. The crowd discussed secretly training troops to prevent unfavorable situations. Tiger Jingwen’s hardships had been completed. Although he had a belly full of knowledge, he still could not develop it. Zheng Jinlian advised him to go to the capital to take the imperial examination. If he could be successful, he could see Emperor Xuan on the one hand and inquire about the whereabouts of the State Mother Su on the other. The prince attached great importance to her words. Then Zheng will write a letter for the prince to hold to Zhang Zhong, who will surely be able to keep him, and ask the prince to be promoted to the West Palace. Emperor Xuan regretted his upside-down deeds and fell asleep, seeing a god leading the Xuan Emperor to a deserted mountain. Looking back, there was no one, and suddenly many fierce beasts appeared and pounced on Emperor Xuan. In a moment of crisis, he saw a golden dragon carrying the fierce beasts away. Emperor Xuan was terrified and dreamed a Nam Ke dream. Emperor Xuan ordered Lin Ying to explain the good and bad omens. Lin said it was an auspicious omen. A prodigy must come out in this imperial examination. Emperor Xuan was overjoyed and ordered Lin Ying’s son, Lin Yurui, to be the chief examiner. Lin Ying instructed him to produce a true life in this imperial examination and seal the examination hall only after the third watch. Zhang Zhong was disheartened with state affairs after the Su family was harmed, and because he was old and ill, he asked for leave to recuperate. Suddenly, it was reported that Prime Minister Zheng had sent someone to send a letter. He thought to himself that although Prime Minister Zheng was a courtier, he had not communicated with each other since he returned to the forest. When he opened the letter, there was no signature, only four lines of hidden words. After careful interpretation, he knew that the prince was coming and questioned the prince. He actually told the truth and hurried into the palace to report to Zhang Guiying. Lin Yurui took the imperial decree to start the imperial examination, called the names, issued the papers, and ordered the room officials to inspect the papers. The examination hall could only be sealed after the third watch. Tiger Jingwen had no intention of fame. On this day, he drank too much and was unwilling to enter the examination hall. The bookboy pleaded bitterly and entered the examination hall only after the second watch. After entering the examination hall, he was drowsy and confused, making many jokes, and only fell asleep in the examination room. After the third watch, the examination hall was sealed, and it was reported that there was revenge for grievances and revenge for hatred. At this time, ghosts appeared and gods appeared, and grievances and complaints were intertwined. The prince was unconscious, and the Kui Xing and Wen Chang were busy. Emperor Xuan personally selected the top three, and the prince won the first name. Emperor Xuan saw that Jingwen had an extraordinary appearance and accepted him as his adopted son, Prince Qian. He entered the palace to meet the State Mother Zhang, and after seeing Consort Miao and Miao Kuan heard that Emperor Xuan had adopted Prince Qian and entered the palace to congratulate him, and when they saw Jingwen, they were enemies, but they did not dare to venture to report. They hurriedly returned to the mansion to discuss with Li Wenlong and others and explained the situation to Consort Miao, asking her to carefully investigate. Zhang Guiying and Tiger Jingwen told each other in the Imperial Garden about the grievances of the State Mother Su, which was secretly overheard by Consort Miao. She returned to the palace and discussed with Miao Kuan and others to plot against the prince to eliminate future troubles. Li Wenlong asked the swordsman Hu Lun to impersonate the prince, assassinate the king, and harm the prince and Zhang Guiying. Li Wenlong had a sister named Yuhuan who was proficient in classics and history. She eavesdropped on her brother’s plot to destroy the family and tried to prevent him, bitterly scolding Hu Lun. Wenlong wanted to kill his sister with a sword, but suddenly a divine wind blew and he was saved by the South Sea and sent to the CaiXia Saint Mother to study the law.</p>
