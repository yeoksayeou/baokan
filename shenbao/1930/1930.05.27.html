<h3>日美之軍約問題</h3>
<p>日美兩國因海軍公約引起之内部糾紛形勢愈趨重大兩國當局皆感無法轉圜之苦而此海軍公約能否不致根本動摇今尙難言也</p>
<p>日本軍界因不滿於公約而起統帥權之爭因爭統帥權而致當國防用兵重任之加藤軍司令部長突然辭職在輿論方面不贊同軍界之强硬態度謂今日當以救濟民生爲急務若政府爲軍界所挾持重國防而不顧民生則人民將起而反對政府在軍部一派則以爲海會如斯結果不獨無以謀國防之安全且干犯統帥權之尊嚴如政府不設法維持則反對政府者皆將起而攻擊政府此問題之形勢已極緊張日政府雖力言軍部之辭職與大局無關樞府亦不至爲難然果使此問題無法挽回則兩方意見愈深難保不另生枝節而於公約之命運前途亦大有影響也</p>
<p>美國海軍派之反對公約運動否决目前仍在進行胡佛總統雖聲言本屆議會如不批准將召集特别會議以解决之但雙方之意見相去旣遠即使召集特别會議亦未必遽有多數之把握蓋議會中反對公約之議員以與會各國皆無實行公約之誠意益不欲首先批准以自陷於無術迴旋之境地故多主張延宕今日華盛頓電謂胡佛召集特别會議之言已顯獲效果外委主席波拉氏與反對派領袖約翰森之會商已有進步恐亦徒作樂觀語耳事實上未必如是轉圖之易也</p>

<p>遠東大會三國總代表現均對大會發表抱負意見分錄中菲日三國代表之談話如次</p>
<p>（一）中華張伯苓</p>
<p>（大會戰爭未解决前勝負不敢武斷然我軍以足排籃三球技誠可自信日本之棒球隊現專待中華而較雌雄將來中日比賽後我軍之實力與程度即可知矣余之希望爲中日菲印四國表青年代表選手均傾全力而作愉快之競技使得有圓滿之進行將來遠東大會一進而擴大爲汎太平洋大會中華當然贊成我國之競技實力雖難與諸先進國家伴較但必十分努力使此懸案實現）</p>
<p>（二）菲律濱胡加司</p>
<p>菲島總代表胡加司氏於東京帝國飯店對新聞記者作以下之談話</p>
<p>（本届菲利濱之代表選手確較出場前數屆大會之選手優秀斯無他故不外我國之撰拔選手</p>
<p>中華女選手在日練習排球</p>
<p>最近俱借鏡於日本之結果也勝敗雖難預想但無論何種競技我國皆有相當之實力全體選手在未渡日前盡行合宿練習棒球與田徑雖在陰雨時亦不懈怠終日苦心操演自信本届可雪前恥總之本届必運用全力而作此一戰）</p>
<h3>（三）日本山本興忠（大會總務委員）</h3>
<p>（中菲印三國青年賓客現均聚於我國新緑之帝都過去每届大會属發生裁判不公之苦惱問題今决十分努力而洗淨此種難關預期作成模範之競技此堪爲慶賀之事本大會第一給我國運動界一大動源今日之競技種目分爲八類較前適宜非常並爲大會開拓以來留一頁青史第二運動爲人類爭鬥之本能爲無上之道德合理行情一方可展開相親之友情及流露純高之社交今回之最精彩者即印度遠來參加一對吾東方人士表示親和之好意運動除球技外我國均有十二分之强力俱可凌駕於三國之上吾國對於東方親善之眞義確負有長兄之責六月一二兩日定在大阪甲子園舉行一國田徑賽藉使我國派往國際之選手得有練習並可解神阪等處國人之渴望最後告東方之青年爲君之祖國光榮而奮鬥速到此自由天地公平無私之戰場祝福我等之東方前途將來定可無約束的而飛躍於世界上）</p>
<p>花花絮絮</p>
<p>日管理認不清楚中華選手</p>
<p>中華選手食量嚇煞東洋人</p>
<p>張伯苓限止男女選手交際</p>
<p>三種文字日本青年館之大門側立一木牌大書遠東運動會印度中華民國菲列賓日本選手御宿所雖含有日文口氣但國人亦不難一目了解所苦者爲印度及菲列賓耳大門之上繪有四國國旗屋頂亦懸四國國旗隨風飄　極爲美觀大門旁貼有大紙條書除選手外不得進門然印菲兩國友人來望者因不識文字仍出進如故辦事人員深感困難因急改書中日英三國文字故凡一種佈告均須用三種文字入青年館到處變成花花緑緑之紙張焉</p>
<h3>面貌錯認</h3>
<p>我國健兒全部居第一層及第二層菲列賓第三層日本第四層印度亦在第四層有粤人馬君者而黑如漆日本管理員誤爲印度選手當彼上樓時用日本式英語止之曰You　India　don't　go　this　Place馬君甚怒用流暢英語曰我爲中國代表非印人也日管理員對英語僅略解一二至是瞠目不知所云反因馬君之英語熟練而信其爲印選手之心益堅攔阻之亦愈力雙方纏擾不清幸有某君來急以日語解釋一場風波始告平息</p>
<h3>竭誠招待</h3>
<p>日本體育協會因各國選手赴日特設招待委員會負一切招等責任當我國男女選手抵日時該會全部出發招待我國女選手寓日本女青年會日本招待員奔波往返不辭其勞可謂的確竭誠招待往女青年會者每日輪流有四招待員前往招料往女青年會者每爭得此星招待部長Ｎ君大爲作難記者曾詢委員會中人以理由有費盡氣力而未被派遣之Ａ君用笨寫（窈窕涉女君子好逑）四字並云中國女選手向我說話我萬分的順意極懇切的答覆菲國女子究竟比不上中國云云</p>
<h3>吃飯問題</h3>
<p>日本人本以肚子小著名於世中國留學生之在日者恒被日人目爲飯桶（吃飯太多之謂非無用的解說）蓋國人之食量普通較大約大一倍也記者晤招待委員會諸君詢招待中國選手感想有Ｋ君說中國男選手食量太大曾見足球選手某君一氣吃了二十四個大饅頭實屬可驚倘中國人都像他我想中國一定要發生絕糧的恐慌了日人小見多怪大都類是倘我國北方勞動者的食量給日人看見豈不要嚇個半死記者因往某君處調查實况某君曰日本人做的饅頭太小一嘴不吃兩個總覺得口中不痛快我那天不過吃十二口而已兩君所言相距千里可稱絕倒</p>
<h3>十五分鐘</h3>
<p>此次我國選手團職員對於管理方面異常認眞凡選手出外均須問總敎練馬約翰君告假籃球健將姚恩漢君適有客來約往晚餐因往請假馬君堅不允許姚急得無法雙手高舉額際行雙鞠躬禮並云祗十五分鐘僅此一遭下不爲例始得如願翌晨記者詢姚究竟是否十五分鐘答謂二小時有餘也</p>
<h3>博士發愁</h3>
<p>我國男選手因人地生疏無處消遣多私乘汽車往日本女子青年會訪女選手談話同時女選手因到場練習同往青年館會唔男選手交際頗繁明治神宫外苑一帶時見男女選手散步林際總代表張伯苓博士與總幹事郝伯陽君恐彼等因此荒廢練習迭開會議商議應付策略張謂他們小孩子們太豈有此理你應該不客氣的禁止他們才對郝曰男女交際本應絕對自由但不守範圍萬一發生錯誤我姓郝的那能担當得起還連累了你老先生商議結果决定無論如何人非有特别理由禁止出外命令下後男女選手大呼掃興不少</p>
<h3>中菲女選手聨歡（曾衍華東京通訉）</h3>
<p>中菲兩國女選手同是寄宿於神田駿河臺之東京女子青年會十八日旅裝甫解作答異鄕十九日上午九時各由敎練領率至神宫競技塲及排球塲從事練習至午後三時許始返宿舍因舟車長途旅行後未無疲勞之苦是夜適天雨故晚飯後三五成羣圍坐笑語或有與到訪之知友傾談或有購日本風景明信片作書寄歸祖國或有頻詢日本女子招待委員熱心學習必要菲選手練習游泳</p>
<p>这會話有頃女子青年會提議開放健身房忽見菲列濱某女士手挾烏克利利樂器高歌彈唱片刻間羣相附和有彈鋼琴者有彈其他樂器以和之即時組成爵士班互相照邀輕快跳舞我國李氏姊妹亦嬌聲唱南洋佳調歌舞交　至九時半始罷於此愉快秤和的零圍氣裏打破一切吳越同舟之念頭亦可謂遠東會前之美談也</p>

<h3>康腦脫路大賭窟案開審</h3>
<p>七十二人被控</p>
<p>僅廿六人到案</p>
<p>供詞奇奇怪怪</p>
<p>聞者足以噴飯</p>
<p>滬西康腦脫路二百三十號門牌破獲之輪盤大賭窟鈔出大批賭具及手槍子彈烟具等物業由上海地方法院檢察官除將該賭窟經理張金寳即王壽寳收押外其餘概准交保計本案被告爲一百二十五名偵查結果</p>
<h3>提起公訴</h3>
<p>者計七十二名昨日下午由刑庭公開審判餘由律師代理當由錢承鈞推事與劉屏藩檢察官開第一法庭審理張金寳供年四十二歲本地人住新記浜路諉稱爲該</p>
<h3>賭窟竹匠</h3>
<p>官問其抄出之手槍兩支及烟具多付何處而來亦答不知嗣經推事訊據何生及吳·賀·兩人在公安局時查得爲樓上樓下之賬房但在法庭上祇認睹容不認職員惟對於張金寳則稱</p>
<h3>實是經理</h3>
<p>等語又公安局查得之開輪盤之王秀東·李信五·王壽峰·王桂元等則在法庭上均供爲</p>
<h3>菜館夥友</h3>
<p>係去白相最後則稱是賭手均非的實之供其餘則一羣賭犯或稱因其招牌爲俱樂部誤走入内或稱尋人有一人竟稱因可到賭窟内</p>
<h3>吃慣白食</h3>
<p>所以時常去吃白食大菜並不是賭手的均是奇奇怪怪令人噴飯約訊至下午五時方始問畢乃由劉檢察官論告意見謂本案在分安局是很鄭重但一到法院則照刑法上是</p>
<h3>簡易案件</h3>
<p>很輕微的而刑事訴訟條例請求交保法官尤不能不許惟張金寳是應受徒刑的故在押但本案各被告俱係在深晚提到雖狡賴亦無用至於手槍二支子彈八顆現無人承認當然是</p>
<h3>賭塲自衛</h3>
<p>應命張金寳負刑事責任至於烟槍等亦無人承認但並非烟館看來或許備於賭客中</p>
<h3>有烟癮者</h3>
<p>受用亦當由張金寳負責而上海此種賭塲在租界上很多亦無從追究對於此種案件旣不憑公安局而嚴峻處治又不能依租界上之處罰</p>
<h3>應依法律</h3>
<p>判决本案起訴者共七十二人今日有不到者可以援引刑事訴訟法三百十一條缺席判决還有一個王小　子查得年僅十一歲應請宣告無罪至此由律師九人辯論至六時後始告竣事審判官諭令辯論終結張金寳還押餘者交原保聽候宣判</p>

<h3>投函嚇詐</h3>
<p>嗣後該匪等又書寫恐嚇信遞交陶伯泉勒索洋六七千元當由事主報告捕房</p>
<h3>先後獲匪</h3>
<p>由特别機關偵探督察員金九林正探目李耀龍副探目毛金根·錢裕民·包探周步廣·張子楹·等假扮事主接洽之人前往約定地點先後將該匪等一併拘獲並抄出手槍三支嗣又續獲關係人劉德裕·施文奎·劉廣才·等帶入捕房</p>

<h3>分得三元</h3>
<p>施文奎供前由陶伯泉託民人與匪接洽但事前並未與匪等串通請求查察劉德裕供向拉黄包車前由在逃之王三將手槍兩去託民人放在車箱内帶至行刼地點事後分用洋三元是實劉廣才供民人雖與王三相識不知行刧之事求察</p>
<h3>律師申辯</h3>
<p>又據施文奎所延費席珍律師代辯稱被告施文奎前由原告託代與匪方接洽實無通匪行爲請求開釋原告陶伯泉由逖百克律師代表聲稱原告接得匪方信函後由施文奎自己到來情願担負與匪接洽如此情形顯見亦有串通行爲請求重辦</p>

<h3>讀四大學國語演說競賽之花花絮絮以後不平</h3>
<p>本月十九日本刋裏有一篇四大學國語演說競賽一文署名三九最後一節標題是（美人計失敗）内容爲某大學去年參加國語演說競賽係用美人計奪得錦標今年復用故智可惜結果失敗云讀了之後不但覺得可笑反而痛恨中國的敎育破產了不然何以受過高等敎育的人（此文作者必是堂堂大學生）腦筋還這樣箪單呢現在爲節省篇幅和經濟時間起見分列幾點來糾正那位作者的錯誤</p>
<p>（一）四大學旣是男女同學爲什麽女同學不能參加競賽規程上規定了只許男生參加比賽嗎</p>
<p>（二）得錦標該由男生包辦嗎女生得了是美人計男生得了是什麽計倒要請敎那位作者</p>
<p>（三）美人計三個字固然可以作爲侮辱女子人格的工具可是根據了第一點理由那末該作者簡直是暴露他本身思想的腐敗和不道德他雖然是二十世紀的人物這種種言論實在是一個食古不化不能適應環境的十八世紀的魯男子呢唉敎育人格簡直破產了二十二日報載二十一日四大學英語競賽的結果又是某校的女生得了第一第三次的美人計又出現了將來也許越過多吧請這位糊塗作者以後把胸襟放一點現在的女子决不是七八年前的女子被你們一譏笑就會嚇退也許環境愈是不好伊們奮鬭的勇氣也愈要增加呢</p>

<h3>極樂鳥</h3>
<p>極樂鳥是南洋巴布亞食人島的特產也是世界聞名的珍貴的鳥類極樂鳥和摩鹿加的（香料）同是引誘歐洲人東航最有力量的東西在十六世紀時葡萄牙人發現摩鹿加羣島的（香料）後於是西班牙人荷蘭人紛紛東航都向摩鹿加羣島爭取香料所以至今摩鹿加羣島又呌做（香料羣島）極樂鳥被歐洲人所知乃在一五二一年麥哲侖東航的時候自此之後凡來採取香料的船必要帶幾羽極樂鳥回到歐洲去作爲一種高貴的貢品同時也是一種珍貴的商品那時一羽就值數百金</p>
<p>現在新嘉坡博物館陳列有四十餘種的極樂鳥其形並不大最大的和喜鵲差不多羽毛美艶有如琥珀珊瑚之色羽尖如長鋭之針能振開若孔雀的尾兩翼濃生柔細的純白毛此毛爲最名貴之物歐洲人多用來裝飾帽子極樂鳥喜追風翔舞空中故土人呼爲神鳥（Bolan　dinata)以爲由極樂之天國降於地上</p>
<p>極樂鳥每至交尾期即有十數羽雄鳥圍住雌鳥在樹梢飛翔各振開其艶麗的翼毛以眩雌鳥向其求歡土人往往利比時期潛伏樹下用不以鳥血污及羽</p>
<p>毛的小心吹矢射之雄鳥因急於向雌鳥求愛往往不注意土人的陰謀所以土人常從容不迫將所有雄鳥一一射殺至今巴布亞島上雄鳥大减羣雌粥粥便是因這緣故</p>
<p>做極樂鳥生意的大抵是華僑華僑在十六七世紀時已有人漂流到食人島的巴布亞現在該島做極樂鳥商者都是數代相傳至今但華僑並不直接入山去捕因巴布亞全島大部還是未聞發的原始森林土人也仍過着野蠻的原始生活而且食人的風甚盛瘴癘之氣毒蛇猛獸遍地都是華橋雖勇於冒險也不敢深入腹地只在沿海邊地與半開化之土人交易半開化的士人將所得的極樂鳥都抵將士人所喜的金銀首飾花布食鹽藝術家唐越石先生去世迄今倐已四閱寒暑現由其夫人賀儀昭女士購定吳家巷中國公墓内基一穴一切管葬手續均已辦理完竣已於國曆五月十五日申時安葬上圖爲唐君遺象</p>
<p>小刀等物與其交易華橋得鳥後即轉售給歐洲人近來每羽最低的價格亦值五</p>

<p>活的極樂鳥除土人外在世上恐没有幾人看過而且生擒的極少所以也不容易飼養探險的人在巴布亞原始叢莽中時常聽到奇異的鳥鳴此即極樂鳥的鳴聲但一般人總以爲像那樣美艶的鳥牠的鳴聲一定是很好聽的所以無論什麽人都不會注意到他</p>
<p>土人將極樂鳥捕獲後即將其脚割去故現所見的極樂鳥幾乎是没有脚的土人也不把極樂鳥的產地告訴人如問他他就撤謊說（極樂鳥常高飛空中非到疲勞時决不下降但其疲勞時即以羽端的細長的銳針懸於樹梢休憩所以没有脚從生下即不知有地吸天露爲生故稱極樂鳥）</p>
<p>又馬來人和華僑又稱極樂鳥爲（死鳥）相傳該鳥在空高翔時有一種芳香的氣味由天而降如有人擊之無不即死所以馬來人與華僑至今仍不敢去捕極樂鳥其實極樂鳥生後四年的雄鳥每年在五月至九月交尾期捕之其羽毛最爲艶麗價值也最高（毛月文）</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications has sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding telephone rights in the Shanghai concessions, requesting negotiations with the concession authorities to take back the rights for a price to be managed by the Ministry to restore national rights. The concession authorities have solicited bids from foreigners to purchase the rights, and the International Telegraph and Telephone Company has won the bid and has unilaterally granted the company a 40-year patent, which infringes on sovereignty and will harm the interests of the majority of Chinese in the concession and the original Chinese shareholders of the company, and may easily cause disputes after the concession is taken back. It has been decided to ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to actively negotiate again to achieve the goal of taking back the rights. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Japan-U.S. Naval Treaty Issue</h3>
<p>The internal dispute between Japan and the United States over the naval treaty is becoming increasingly serious. Both countries' authorities feel that there is no way to resolve the situation, and it is still difficult to say whether this naval treaty will not be fundamentally shaken.</p>
<p>The Japanese military is dissatisfied with the treaty and has started a struggle for the right of command. Because of the struggle for the right of command, Kato, the commander-in-chief of the army, who is in charge of the important task of national defense and military operations, suddenly resigned. In terms of public opinion, they do not agree with the military's tough attitude, saying that today's priority should be to relieve people's livelihood. If the government is held hostage by the military and values ​​national defense over people's livelihood, then the people will rise up and oppose the government. The military believes that if the outcome of the meeting is like this, it will not only fail to seek national defense security but also offend the dignity of the right of command. If the government does not find a way to maintain it, those who oppose the government will attack the government. The situation of this problem has become extremely tense. Although the Japanese government has repeatedly stated that the military's resignation has nothing to do with the overall situation, the hub government will not be embarrassed. However, if this problem cannot be recovered, the opinions of both sides will become deeper. It is difficult to guarantee that no other problems will arise, which will also have a great impact on the fate and future of the treaty.</p>
<p>The American navy's anti-treaty movement to reject the current treaty is still in progress. Although President Hoover has stated that if the current Congress does not approve it, he will convene a special meeting to resolve it, but the opinions of both sides are so far apart that even if a special meeting is convened, it may not be possible to quickly have a majority of the votes. Because the members of Congress who oppose the treaty believe that the participating countries have no sincerity in implementing the treaty and do not want to be the first to approve it and put themselves in a situation where there is no way to maneuver. Therefore, many people advocate delaying it. Today, a Washington telegram said that Hoover's call for a special meeting has obviously had an effect. The meeting between Bora, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Johnson, the leader of the opposition, has made progress. I am afraid that it is just an optimistic statement. The fact may not be so easy to change.</p>

<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>A certain party's news that Zhang Gui's army abandoned Guizhou and fled to Hunan was due to the repeated pressure from the Central Army. Another plan was to take the road to Hengzhou and transfer to Pingxiang, hoping to join forces with Jin Handing's rebel army to echo Yan and Feng. However, since the defeat of the rebel army on the Longhai Line, the Central Army has made progress day by day, and its rebellious plot has completely failed. It was learned that Zhang Gui's rebel army entered Hunan from Guilin in two routes, one east to Ningyuan and one northeast to the area between Dong'an and Qiyang, forming a corner. However, the Fourth Route Army in Hunan Province, in addition to the 19th Division stationed in Hengzhou that has set out to block them, all the troops that entered Guizhou have also been transferred back to the area between Hengzhou and Lingling. The military strength is extremely strong. The outposts of the 17th and 18th between Hengbao and Ningyuan have been in contact, but there have been no battles in recent days. Zhang Gui entrenched in the overlapping mountains of Guizhou Province, making it difficult to eliminate the bandits. This time, he moved his nest to the east in an attempt to succeed, which just gave the Central Army the opportunity to attack on both sides. (26th)</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Supreme Command in Japan; Chief of Naval General Staff Resolutely Resigns</h3>
<p>Rumored to Have Submitted Resignation</p>
<p>Government Seeking Resolution</p>
<p>Dentsu Tokyo, 26th—The government's insistence on the military's position has become tense due to the return of the Minister of Finance and the Navy. The Chief of the Naval General Staff, who is responsible for national defense and military operations, although somewhat clearer about the facts after the explanations of the Minister of Finance and the Navy and Lieutenant General Sakonji, is extremely dissatisfied with the military's long-standing assertion that less than 70% of the U.S. strength not only cannot ensure national defense but also violates the government's authority over supreme command. It is rumored that Chief of the Naval General Staff Kato submitted his resignation to the Minister of Finance and the Navy on the 21st. The government and the military are currently maintaining strict secrecy and are working to find a satisfactory solution. Depending on how the situation develops, it may trigger a question of responsibility for the Minister of the Navy.</p>
<p>Dentsu Tokyo, 26th—It has been a week since the Minister of the Navy returned to the country, and he is still in daily negotiations with the military. However, Chief Kato's attitude remains firm and he has not yet understood the situation. It is generally believed that he will inevitably resign. Within the government, it is believed that even if the Minister resigns, the majority of the people understand the government's measures and it is not related to the overall situation. Even the Privy Council will not be difficult. However, the members of the Upper House who come from the military still attach importance to the issue of supreme command and are looking for an opportunity to confront the government's urgency. The general opinion within the Navy is more stable. Kato and Zaibu are cooperating to find a way to supplement the shortcomings.</p>
<p>Dentsu Tokyo, 26th—Since Chief of the Naval General Staff Kato expressed his intention to resign, the issue of supreme command has become increasingly serious. Regarding this matter, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun and Jiji Shinpo commented in their editorials this morning as follows: The Asahi Shimbun said that the government seems to be fussing over the issue of supreme command, but from the people's point of view, reducing the people's burden is more important. If the government is constrained by the navy on this issue and forgets to reduce the people's burden, it is feared that it will arouse public opinion to change from the current calm attitude toward supreme command to attacking the government. Jiji Shinpo said that merely reducing the financial resources of the navy is not enough to actively reduce the burden on the people. The government should also decisively reduce the army, streamline administration, and fulfill its covenant with the people.</p>
<h3>U.S. Plans to Revise Immigration Law</h3>
<p>Intended to Eliminate Ill Feelings Between Japan and the U.S.</p>
<p>United Press Washington, 25th—Since Representative Johnson, Chairman of the House Immigration Committee, announced a plan to revise the immigration law so that Japan could also have an immigration quota into the U.S., many researchers believe that this move is merely to express goodwill toward Japan. In reality, Japanese people still do not have the qualifications to obtain U.S. citizenship. However, Johnson himself believes that the bad feelings of the Japanese towards the U.S. are mostly due to the discriminatory feelings caused by the lack of a Japanese quota in the immigration law. Otherwise, since the Gentleman's Agreement was concluded, it has already prevented a large number of Japanese from becoming citizens of the U.S. His plan is sufficient to show an equal treatment for the Japanese.</p>

<h3>Central Party Headquarters and National Government's Memorial Week</h3>
<p>At 9:00 a.m. on the 26th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 61st Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters. About 500 people attended, including members of the Central Committee, staff from various departments and offices, and guests. After Chairman Sun Ke performed the ceremony, Ye Chucang reported, saying: Since I was appointed as the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, I have not been able to work at the Central Government every day, and therefore I have made less progress. Although local areas have their own work, the situation is different from the Central Government, and I cannot often receive the instruction of the Central Committee members, so I feel that I have regressed in the past two months. Because the Central Government entrusted me with reporting on this Memorial Week, I would like to contribute my research on the current situation to all comrades. Recently, the Northern Expedition's military affairs have been very successful, and the main force of the rebel army will soon be defeated. The date of its complete elimination is not far away. Before the rebellious traces of Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan were obvious, they had already used the reorganization faction to operate in the north, colluding secretly to create the weakness of our party in the north. On the one hand, they fabricated reactionary rhetoric and boasted of the superiority of their policies, wantonly slandering the Central Government in every way to deceive the people in the north, so that the Central Government and the north could not avoid being separated, and the people in the north could not avoid doubting the Central Government. At the same time, Yan Xishan used the name of the Central Government to collect money from local areas and used the name of local areas to demand money from the Central Government. All the money obtained was used to satisfy his own pockets. Because the people's ability to judge was not sufficient, they almost fell into a five-mile fog. Now, the various factions of people who are colluding with Feng and Yan and receiving the flattery of Feng and Yan have been in the north for a long time. What they are doing is nothing more than competing for positions of dominance between this faction and that faction, making endless demands on the people, causing the financial situation to become increasingly chaotic. The facts that are evident are completely contrary to what they usually advocate. The masks have been completely exposed. The people have suddenly realized through substantial comparison that these people can only create trouble and cannot create fortune, and their belief in the Central Government has become increasingly firm. The rebellion of Feng and Yan is tantamount to knocking themselves down and promoting the foundation of our party in the local areas to become more and more solid. On a national scale, since the military affairs occurred, all local areas have been very calm. The rebellious elements have never stopped thinking about creating rumors and making trouble in the south, hoping to undermine the strength of the Central Government, but the provinces have consistently supported the Central Government and will never be shaken. Feng and Yan also never stopped wanting to collude with imperialists to undermine diplomacy, but the Central Government has completely followed a fixed policy in diplomacy, which has been deeply understood by the international community and is very smooth, without any impact. This good phenomenon is due to the legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and also the effort of our comrades. After the foundation of our party is consolidated, we should continue to struggle and maintain the foundation built on the Three Principles of the People forever and develop it more and more. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>At 10:00 a.m. on the same morning, the National Government held the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Enkebatu, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruiheng, Chen Yi, Zhou Yawei, Chen Shaokuan, Zhang Nanxian, Zhang Wohua, Chen Yu, Zhu Jingnong, Li Jinlun, Li Zhonggong, and staff from the Civil Affairs and Military Affairs departments, totaling more than 300 people, attended. After Chairman Tan Yankai performed the ceremony, Secretary Qian Changzhao gave a political report as follows: (The military affairs in the front are very victorious, and Xuchang and Kaifeng can be taken at any moment. The rebellion of Yan and Feng will soon be quelled, but this time the people have suffered great losses directly and indirectly. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is very concerned about this point in the front, and in addition to sending personnel to console the people in the disaster areas and provide relief, he has also telegraphed the Central Government to plan for compensation for the losses. Last week, the State Council resolved to order the Executive Yuan to supervise the Disaster Relief Committee to properly handle the matter. The holding of the Mongolian Conference is based on the resolutions of the Third National Congress, Second Plenary Session. It was originally scheduled to be convened in November last year, but because the procedures for sending representatives were complicated and the official documents were delivered with difficulty, it was postponed to February of this year. Later, because the transportation in Mongolia was inconvenient and the representatives could not arrive in Beijing as scheduled, it was postponed again to April. In fact, the representatives only arrived in succession in the middle of this month, and the opening ceremony was held on the 21st. Last week, the preparatory meeting has been held four times, and the formal conference will be held soon. At the time of the rebellion of Yan and Feng, the representatives did not</p>

<p>The representatives disregarded the hardships and came together from afar, which is a very good phenomenon. Their spirit is very admirable, and their task is very important. As for the necessity of developing Mongolia, I have spoken about it several times during the Memorial Week. Unfortunately, the general people of our country are too ignorant of the situation in Mongolia. There are certainly not many people who have personally gone to Mongolia to investigate, and there are also very few books published about Mongolia. As a result, the Japanese and Russians know more about it than we do. This is so shameful. Now that the Mongolian Conference is being held, it can make up for everything. Speaking of developing Mongolia, there are countless things that should be done, among which education, transportation, and sanitation are the three most important. In 1925, I also traveled in Inner Mongolia for a few months. At that time, the most profound impression I had was the lack of education, the inconvenience of transportation, and the lack of attention to sanitation. In terms of education, in a few places, there are only three or four elementary schools and one or two higher elementary schools in one banner. Educational resources are scarce, and there are very few opportunities for children to go to school. Under these circumstances, culture cannot of course progress. Education is like this, and the difficulty of transportation is even more needless to say. Wherever you go, you feel that it is not easy to travel, and the transportation of goods is very slow. In short, if transportation is not paid attention to, other economic development is really out of the question. Furthermore, in terms of sanitation, the general people of Mongolia, because of the climate and habits, do not pay much attention to cleanliness in their diet and clothing. Except for the former residences of princes and the Lama temples, most of the dwellings are simple houses or tents, the so-called Mongolian yurts, and some are cave dwellings. This point should be gradually improved, and its impact on the national spirit is very great. I believe that this conference should pay special attention to the above three items. If the manpower and financial resources are limited for the time being, then do as much as possible within the possible scope. The Central Government will certainly do its best to help. At the same time, I hope that aspiring young people will all go to Mongolia in groups. You must know that there are many opportunities for development in the area north of 40 degrees latitude in our country, but if you can start a new era in Mongolia, its success will be much more magnificent).</p>
<h3>News from the Henan-Shandong Military Situation</h3>
<p>Central Army Encircles Lanfeng City</p>
<p>He Yaozu Arrives in Xuzhou to Discuss Shandong War</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Central Army has passed through Lanfeng, but Lanfeng City is still under siege. According to a telegram from the Second Army Group Headquarters on the 23rd at noon from Minquan County, when the enemy army retreated to Lanfeng on the afternoon of the 22nd, a part of them still occupied positions in Zhuzhai and Wangzhai near Lanfeng to cover the retreat. After the Central Army combined its forces to defeat them, more than 3,000 prisoners were captured and more than 2,000 rifles were seized. On the morning of the 23rd, the Central Army began to pass through Lanfeng. However, Lanfeng City is located on a plateau, about three miles north of the main railway line. The city can be seen very clearly from the station. The Central Army immediately used a part of its force to encircle and attack the city, and a part of its force advanced forward. At the same time, the troops on both wings also attacked Kaifeng, etc. This morning (24th), the engineering personnel of the Longhai Railway telegraphed from Yejigang to Xuzhou, saying that the vanguard of the Central Army had crossed Luowang, and Lanfeng City was under attack today. The telegraph along the western road can be connected to Luowang. Liu Zhi stationed in Yejigang last night to supervise the army. The military train can now reach Yejigang. However, a 30-meter-long iron bridge in the 133-meter section between Yejigang and Neihuang was severely damaged by the enemy army when they retreated. The Xuzhou station has rushed to transport materials to the west to repair it together.</p>
<p>He Yaozu was ordered to be stationed in Jinan before the war. He had previously gone to western Shandong to inspect. This morning (24th) at 8:00 a.m., He took a special train with Zhang Yue, Chief of Staff of the First Army Group Headquarters, Wang Xiangrong, Chief of Logistics of the Third Route Army, and other personnel from Jinan to Xuzhou. He brought his family members and was temporarily lodged in the Telecommunications Bureau dormitory by Kuang Jingyou, Director of the Telecommunications Bureau. The reporter interviewed He and Zhang at the station at that time. According to He, when inspecting western Shandong, he had gone to Yuncheng and Heze. The enemy troops had already been defeated. Most of the enemies there were the troops of Shi Yousan and Liu Chunrong. There were very few Jin troops. At the moment, Chen Tiaoyuan is still commanding in Heze. Northern Shandong is very calm and there has been no contact of any kind. He also said that Shi Yousan's will is uncertain. Although he says he has become aware on the surface, it is unlikely that he will. Zhang said that Commander-in-Chief Han had recently gone to Yuncheng and Heze to inspect and returned to Jinan yesterday. He was ordered by Han to come to Xuzhou to report everything. He also said that a few days ago, Shi Yousan had repeatedly telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Han to express his awareness. Recently, there have been fewer telegrams. Shi may have become aware after Han's telegrams of persuasion. As for Shi's troops, most of them have retreated to the north and south banks of the Yellow River. (24th)</p>
<p>Continued News: The Central Army's attack on the enemy troops in the Lanfeng area is described in great detail by He Yaozu, Zhang Yue, Wang Xiangrong, and others after returning to Xuzhou from Neihuang. The reason is that He and others went west at 10:00 a.m. yesterday and arrived in Guide by car in the afternoon and went to the front to inspect. They arrived in Neihuang at 8:00 p.m. and returned to Xuzhou at 12:00 p.m. today (25th). According to He, when inspecting Neihuang yesterday, our army is now in the Lanfeng area. Lanfeng still has Jin troops stationed there. Most of Sun Liangcheng's troops are on the Longhai Line. Wang Xiangrong also said that the situation after the war was good along the way. The iron bridge between Neihuang and Yejigang has been repaired. The military train goes directly to Neihuang. The station west of Neihuang is Lanfeng, so the front line is about 30 miles west of Neihuang. However, our side's flanking troops have already bypassed Lanfeng. He and others went north to Jinan after lunch. It is said that after He arrives in Jinan and meets Han, he will return to Beijing. (25th)</p>
<h3>Han Fuju Goes to Yucheng to Inspect</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuju, Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group, took the armored train "Beiping" with Chief of Staff Li Zongbi at 10:00 p.m. tonight to Yucheng to inspect. Because he was in a hurry, only Commander of the Garrison Shi Zhongcheng and the chiefs of various departments of the First Army Group were at the station to see him off.</p>
<p>As for the situation in northern Shandong, Li Shengda's troops of the Jin Army in Dezhou had only one regiment before. In recent days, two new regiments have been added, totaling three regiments. Li Shengda himself is also in Dezhou. The foremost outpost is a small village north of Zhangzhuang Station, which looks like it is invading south. Han Fuju attaches great importance to this and sent Sun Tongxuan to check. Sun has already gone to Yucheng with Tang Kexun to investigate this morning (23rd).</p>
<p>Jinan Continued News: Han Fuju, Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group, took the armored train "Beiping" from Jinan to the north on the evening of the 23rd to inspect along the way. After arriving in Yucheng, he discussed military affairs in the north with Sun Tongxuan and others. This morning (24th) at 10:30 a.m., he returned to Jinan in the original train. After Han got off the train, he told reporters that there had been a small conflict between our army and the Jin army cavalry north of Yucheng on the afternoon of the 23rd, but there was no major battle. He then took a car back to the General Command Headquarters and discussed the military affairs in northern Shandong with Jiang Bocheng, Chief Counselor of the Military Headquarters, for a long time. At 3:30 p.m., he still took the armored train "Beiping" to Yucheng to inspect. According to Jiang Bocheng, although Li Shengda's troops of the Jin Army in northern Shandong are called a division, their strength is only a brigade because they were originally a brigade that was expanded. This small conflict was to contain our army and cover the retreat, and they would never dare to invade south.</p>

<h3>Temporary Maintenance of the Status Quo for Jiangsu Public Organizations</h3>
<p>Funding Will Continue to be Allocated as Usual</p>
<p>Since the central government promulgated the newly established People's Organization Law, public organizations in Jiangsu Province have been in a state of suspension. The Provincial Party Headquarters specially requested instructions from the central government as to whether the abolition could be temporarily delayed. Subsequently, the Central Secretariat replied in a letter approving the request from the Central Training Department. It stated that the funding would continue to be allocated by the government as usual. The original letter from the Central Secretariat is recorded below: (Previously, the Standing Committee forwarded your association's report on whether the various levels of existing vertical organizations of public groups in the province could be temporarily delayed in their abolition to meet special needs, and whether the funding for maintaining the status quo of the various public groups should also be specially requested from the government to be allocated by the government as usual. The matter was approved and forwarded to the Central Training Department. Now, a reply has been received stating: "The Ministry is currently reviewing the reorganization methods for people's organizations. After submitting it to the Standing Committee for approval, it will be promulgated immediately. All levels of people's organizations in Jiangsu Province should wait for the central government to promulgate the reorganization methods for people's organizations before reorganizing accordingly. Before the reorganization is completed, the necessary funding should be temporarily requested from the provincial government to be allocated as usual for maintenance. Please forward this for review and reply, etc." After review and approval, it was instructed to be handled and informed to the Jiangsu Provincial Government by the National Government, and a special letter was sent to the National Government and replied, to be checked and taken into consideration.</p>
<h3>Liu Yaodong Acquitted and Released</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Liu Yaodong, commander of the temporarily compiled First Brigade under the command of Ren Yingqi of the 49th Division, stationed in the Dezhou area of northern Shandong province around September of last year. Liu's troops were stationed in Gaotang and Qihe for a short time, after which the division was ordered by the central government to be transferred to Haizhou. Liu's brigade was ordered by the division headquarters to remain in its original defense and engage in training. However, after the division headquarters departed, the brigade's supplies were not available, so it petitioned the provincial government for temporary permission to raise funds locally. This led to conflicts with the local area, resulting in the indictment by the director of the Gaotang Education Bureau, Liu Heqing, and the director of the Finance Bureau, Tian Shiyu, etc. Chen Tiaoyuan ordered the commander of the 164th Brigade, Li Songshan, to reorganize Liu's brigade and detain Liu Yaodong in the military law office. Subsequently, the military law office sent him to the High Court, which forwarded him to the local court prosecutor's office to be prosecuted for disturbing the peace. After repeated trials by Jin Zhaopeng, a judge in the criminal division of the local court, Liu Yaodong presented rebuttal evidence stating that the mobilization of troops was indeed ordered and there were telegrams and instructions from the provincial government that could be checked. The local court investigated and confirmed this, and on the 21st of this month, Liu Yaodong was acquitted and released. The judgment was delivered today (the 24th). The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Jinan Local Court Criminal Judgment (No. 356)) Defendant Liu Yaodong, male, 39 years old, from Gaomi, residing in Sanlizhuang, Attorney Zhang Fangyi chosen as defense counsel. The above-named defendant was prosecuted by the prosecutor for the case of disturbing the peace. After trial by this court, the judgment is as follows: Main text: Liu Yaodong is acquitted. Facts: The prosecutor's office of this court received an order from the Shandong High Court, approving the sending of a letter from the General Headquarters of the punitive expeditionary army, sending the case of Liu Yaodong, the former commander of the temporarily compiled First Brigade, for wreaking havoc on the people and looting property, ordering the investigation and handling of the case, etc. After the case was proposed and inquired, the Gaotang County Court was requested to inform the plaintiffs, Liu Heqing, Director of the Education Bureau, and Tian Shiyu, Director of the Finance Bureau, etc., to come to court for questioning. Subsequently, a reply was received and a statement from Liu Heqing, etc., was obtained. After further interrogation on the circumstances listed in the original statement, it was considered that there was insufficient suspicion of crime and a decision was made not to prosecute. However, the defendant admitted that he had recruited defeated soldiers to form a temporarily compiled brigade. He also claimed that it was a matter of strategic relations to collect miscellaneous troops. As for the defendant's claim that he had central orders, there was no substantial evidence. His actions were found to be in violation of Article 164 of the Criminal Law, and he was prosecuted in court. Reasoning: The defendant in this case admitted that he had recruited miscellaneous troops to form a brigade. However, whether or not a crime has been committed depends on whether the recruitment of such troops has been approved by the central government and whether there is sufficient evidence as a prerequisite to resolve this case. According to the defendant's defense evidence, there is a telegram from Chairman Chen of Shandong dated September 11 of last year, which says, "Commander Liu of Gaotang, Yaodong, etc." There is also a written instruction from the provincial government, No. 1451, dated November 27, stating, "Received the report. The Liu Yaodong Brigade is directly subordinate to the 49th Division of the Central Government, etc." The Shandong High Court was requested to investigate the case and verify the truth. Now, the Shandong Provincial Government's official letter, forwarded by the High Court's instruction, states: "There is a record of instruction No. 1451, which is consistent with the original file. The Zhen telegram was issued by the General Headquarters of the Punitive Expeditionary Reserve Team, which can be verified, etc." It is found that the General Headquarters' Zhen telegram and the provincial government's instructions regarding the brigade established by the defendant Liu Yaodong have been approved and explicitly stated that it is directly subordinate to the 49th Division of the Central Government. Therefore, the recruitment and command of the brigade have not been disallowed and there is clear evidence. Based on the above discussion, the actions of the defendant Liu Yaodong should not constitute a crime. Therefore, in accordance with Article 316 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. Xu Qufei, the prosecutor, attended the court to perform his duties in this case.)</p>
<h3>Tears of Blood from All Chinese Merchants in Mongolia (Continued)</h3>
<p>Implementing Red Education: All school textbooks are mainly in Russian, with Mongolian attached. Publications, such as speeches, publications, writings, and propaganda, are all Soviet Russian red doctrines. Mongolian youth, other than Soviet Russia, do not know that there are other countries in the world, and other than Marx and Lenin, they do not know that there are other great academics and great politicians. The Mongolian-Russian Joint Agricultural and Commercial Bank was established and issued banknotes. The name is Mongolian-Russian joint venture, but the actual power is controlled by the Russians. Mongolians only listen to their orders. Silver coins used in all places, such as the Russian ruble, weigh about five qian per yuan, while Chinese silver coins, which weigh seven qian and two fen, are only worth eighty or ninety percent of the ruble. The conspiracy to exclude the Chinese is self-evident. The printing of coins and banknotes is all supervised by Russia, and Mongolian cash is absorbed under the guise of minting. Exchange rates are handled by the Soviet Russian Far East Bank, which monopolizes the market. Chinese merchants' money cannot be freely transferred. After the Sino-Eastern Railway issue occurred, the bank suspended operations, and Chinese merchants' remittances were completely cut off.</p>
<p>Instigated by Red Russia, Mongolian officials forced people to invest in the Xihe Company, which has a head office in Kulun and branch offices in various Mongolian banners. Russians are invited to be managers. Mongolians are only there to be instructed. However, due to embezzlement by the Russians, the Xihe Company repeatedly suffered losses. In order to maintain the company's business and exclude Chinese trade, Mongolian officials ordered all Mongolians to trade with the company, otherwise they would be punished. Wherever the company's trading organizations reach, they use coercion to intimidate Mongolians to exclude Chinese merchants and prohibit Chinese merchants from establishing branches in order to achieve economic monopoly. The Russians are in a position of turning from guests to masters, regarding the Chinese as thorns in their eyes and flesh, wishing to drive them out of the country immediately. Therefore, they secretly entice Mongolian officials to inform the people that they are not allowed to return Chinese debts. This non-legal method has caused Chinese merchants to lose no less than tens of millions of yuan, resulting in bankruptcies and closures everywhere.</p>
<p>Investigations reveal that Outer Mongolia has the richest mineral deposits in various places, such as the gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, crystal, and coal mines in the Khan Mountains, Tangnu Mountains, Khentii Mountains, Altai Mountains, and Sayan Mountains. The plains have many salt flats and alkaline ponds. The Kusu-Chamyr Pond in the Uriankhai area produces a large amount of gold sand. Most of the Russian residents and Koreans who have fled there rely on this pond for their livelihoods. The mountains and forests have animals such as bears, leopards, foxes, deer, jackals, lynx, and squirrels. The grasslands produce marmots and antelope horns, astragalus membranaceus, and all kinds of valuable medicinal materials, as well as mushrooms and other items. All kinds of natural resources can be called a world-class gold mine. However, the rulers of Outer Mongolia are all lured and bribed by the Russians, arbitrarily searching and freely exploiting them. Various products obtained from each place are transported to Russia by car for enjoyment. Regarding the livestock privately owned by Mongolians, heavy taxes are collected according to the number. For example, for camels, as much as six yuan is collected per head each year. The rest can be imagined. If the report does not match, and they are unable to pay the tax, the livestock will be confiscated. Last winter, an order was issued to implement communism. The Mongolians, who were known to be wealthy, were only allowed to keep a limited number of livestock and necessary equipment. The rest was all confiscated by the government. The Mongolian people all hated it, but they all dared to be angry but dared not speak out. When Chinese merchants purchased marmot skins, it was not prohibited beforehand. After the purchase was completed, because Russian merchants sold a large amount of otter skins produced in Outer Mongolia to other foreign merchants and signed a contract, there were no goods to deliver. They then encouraged the Mongolian authorities to order the various banners to use severe means to confiscate all the otter skins owned by Chinese merchants. Last year, Chinese merchants lost no less than 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Eastern Incident, the furs and other goods stored by Chinese merchants in various places in Outer Mongolia have been sealed off and prohibited from leaving the country. The head office of the Chinese-Mongolian business in the interior felt the cut off of remittance sources and suffered from the difficulty of sealing off goods. It had no surplus to ship goods to Outer Mongolia. The Mongolian-Russian Xihe Company was afraid that our government would inevitably detain the company's goods from being exported because it did not release Chinese merchants' goods and money out of the country. Therefore, it secretly used a certain foreigner to purchase goods in the name of a certain foreign company, about 10,000 dan. It was found that the goods purchased and transported by a certain foreign company were changed to the name of the Xihe Company as soon as they arrived in Ude and sent to Outer Mongolia, on the one hand, to meet the needs of the Mongolians, and on the other hand, to resist Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>It is found that Outer Mongolia levies extremely heavy taxes on Chinese merchants and arbitrarily makes things difficult for them. This is an unprecedented act of tyranny. For example, a business with a capital of 10,000 yuan has to pay no less than six or seven hundred yuan in various taxes every month. All goods transported to Kulun have to go through three military checkpoints in Ude and other places, where they are made difficult in every possible way. When they arrive at the Kulun Tax Bureau, the goods are unloaded at the bureau and reported to various agencies for inspection, and then a Russian-Mongolian three-part form is purchased to fill in the color and quantity of the goods and report them to the tax bureau for valuation and taxation. Each of these tax forms costs 1 yuan and 5 fen and can only be filled in with 13 types of goods. Each time a business ships various goods, there must be hundreds or thousands of types. The cost of the tax form alone reaches dozens or hundreds of yuan. The valuation method is still not fixed, and the tax bureau staff opens their mouths and changes their minds according to their happiness and anger. Often the amount of tax exceeds several times the value of the goods. After the tax is declared, it takes at least half a month or 20 days to complete the inspection, and some are even held up for two months and cannot be inspected. During the tax payment period in the tax bureau, in addition to the assessed tax, there are also weighing fees, guarding fees, tax bureau entrance fees, unpacking fees, transportation fees for the transportation bureau, and so on. Chinese merchants who do not occupy a door cabinet can stay in official shops and pay 1 yuan and 5 jiao per person per day for meals. For Chinese people entering Outer Mongolia, they must first send three photos of themselves to Kulun. The photos are stamped with a watermark by three businesses and submitted to the chamber of commerce for transfer to the internal defense office to apply for a passport. After several months, the passport can be obtained and sent back to the mainland. The person holding the passport enters the country and is stripped naked and inspected all over the body at each checkpoint along the way, regardless of winter or summer. If anyone is found to be carrying notes or receipts, they will be detained immediately in a dark dungeon without food or drink. Friends and relatives must send food, and they will be humiliated and tortured by the jailers. Unless they find a way to entrust someone to the chamber of commerce to guarantee and beg for release. All Chinese people in Outer Mongolia must have a passport, and they must renew it according to the regulations when it expires. If the deadline is exceeded by a few days, they will be heavily fined, otherwise they will be deported and their property will be confiscated. If poor farmers and workers without a passport are caught, they will be expelled from the country if they are slightly guilty, or they will be treated as bandits if they are heavily guilty. People leaving the country must obtain a one-month road pass in addition to their passport before they can travel. Each person is only allowed to carry 20 yuan for travel expenses and is not allowed to carry too much luggage. If they carry slightly new clothes, they will be heavily taxed, otherwise they will be bought at the lowest price. The above is the general situation of making things difficult for the Chinese. As for the various acts of trampling that are unbearable, they are too numerous to mention.</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>The Defense of Northern Jiangxi is Becoming More Consolidated</h3>
<p>He Yingqin Agreed to Send Troops to Jiangxi</p>
<p>Peng's Bandits Fled to Jiugong Mountain in Xiushui</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since the Tang Yunshan Brigade was transferred to Anqing, the defense vacancy has been filled by the 18th Division. The provincial government, considering the importance of northern Jiangxi, specially appointed Jiang Ji, a member of the provincial government and director of the Education Department, to go to Wuhan at the provincial affairs meeting to request the dispatch of troops to increase the defense. After Jiang arrived in Jiangxi, he reported to He Yingqin, the chief of the camp, on the defense of the province and the disturbances caused by bandits and communists in various counties, requesting that capable troops be added to Jiangxi to assist in the suppression. He agreed to send troops to Jiangxi to assist in the suppression.</p>
<p>Peng Dehuai's bandits previously captured Xiushui. After the 18th Division's Zhu Yaohua Brigade led two regiments, Yi and Yu, to suppress them, Peng's bandits were defeated and retreated to Jiugong Mountain on the border of Hunan and Hubei. Commander Zhu sent a detailed telegram yesterday reporting on the bandit situation. The original text is as follows: (1) At dawn on Qiao Day, Yi and Yu's two regiments under my command launched a fierce attack on Peng and Li's bandits in Xiucheng. The bandits resisted stubbornly. After three hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and fled in disarray to the northeast. It is estimated that three bandit company commanders and more than 200 bandits were killed, and many guns and spears were seized. (2) According to County Magistrate Tan, the capture of Xiu was indeed carried out by the troops under Peng and Li, with 4,000 guns and more than 10,000 peasant bandits who attacked the city from all sides early in the morning. Battalion Commander Qian, stationed in Xiu, led the crowd to fight bravely, but due to the disparity in numbers, they were captured by noon, and personnel from various agencies had to hide. (3) Thousands of peasant and worker bandits all carried shoulder poles and ropes specifically to rob rice, grain, salt, and goods. There was considerable damage in the city. (4) According to Li, the camp commander of the Yi Regiment, police officers who were captured and escaped claimed that Peng's 5th Column had about 4,000 guns and 8 machine guns, and departed yesterday morning at noon in Sidu, fleeing to Jiugong Mountain on the border of Hunan and Hubei in a very embarrassed state. (5) I have ordered Yi and Yu's two regiments to quickly scout and confirm the bandits' traces and pursue them thoroughly, striving to annihilate them. (6) The brigade headquarters is stationed in Xiushui.</p>
<p>In addition, Chairman Lu received a telegram yesterday from Jin Handing, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the three provinces, from Ganzhou, stating that Ding arrived in Ganzhou today. It was reported that Zhu's bandits had fled to Pingyuan and seemed to have plans to enter Guangdong. It is planned to wait until the deployment here is slightly settled before cooperating in the suppression according to the original plan to achieve the effect of encirclement and annihilation (23rd).</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province's Policy to Save the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>The silk industry in Zhejiang Province has been in sharp decline recently, to the point of being unsustainable. Factories have been closing down from time to time. The silk industry has repeatedly telegraphed for a reduction in taxes as the only requirement. Zhang Jingjiang, chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, considers the silk industry to be the lifeblood of Zhejiang's industry and commerce. If no measures are taken to save it, the future will be unimaginable. Heavy taxes in the interior are indeed one of the difficulties. For example, each bolt of silk in Zhejiang Province costs two or three yuan more than in Shanghai and more than one yuan more than in Suzhou. Since the cost has advantages and disadvantages, the selling price will naturally be high and low. The failure of the commercial market is inevitable. In order to save the emergency, it is specially proposed to reduce the tax rate on silk fabrics by one-quarter, and in order to promote electric weaving, if people can use the latest European and American electric weaving machines to set up factories and submit them to the Construction Department for verification and approval, they will be exempt from all taxes. All have been discussed and approved and ordered to be implemented by the Finance and Construction Departments. The Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee has also formulated relief policies and prepared them for discussion at the provincial representative conference. The following is a record: A. Relief Policies (1) Regarding the improvement of production and management: 1. Improve the method of using capital in factories. 2. Improve the method of factory management. 3. Improve workers' knowledge to strive to increase production and improve skills. (4) Strive to adjust the interests of labor and capital. 5. Promote production cooperation to support the development of small-scale machine households. (2) Regarding production technology: 1. Improve sericulture. 2. Improve silk reeling. 3. Improve weaving. 4. Improve machinery. 5. Intensify worker technical training. (3) Regarding the expansion of domestic and foreign markets: 1. Gradually reduce silk export taxes. 2. Strive to expand the British and American markets. 3. Increase silk import taxes. 4. Develop the manufacture of inexpensive silk fabrics to meet the needs of our country's customers with weak purchasing power. (4) Regarding government protection, awards, and guidance: 1. Strictly implement protection tariffs, such as increasing the export tax on silkworm cocoons and reducing the export tax on silk. 2. Award the manufacture of new silk fabrics and subsidize the establishment of silk weaving factories. 3. Create production guidance agencies and formulate the most effective guidance methods. B. Methods to Implement Relief Policies: Within two months after the approval of this case, the Zhejiang Provincial Government will hire experts to organize the Zhejiang Silk Industry Relief Program Compilation Committee. Under the guidance and supervision of both the party and the government, the entire program will be drafted within four months based on the principles of this case. The provincial government will then convene the Zhejiang Silk Industry Relief Conference to discuss the program. This conference will be organized by representatives from the party and government of the province, representatives from the party departments and construction agencies of relevant counties, representatives from sericulture and silk academic institutions, sericulture and silk experts, and representatives from the sericulture and silk industry.</p>

<p>Methods for Collecting Scripture Recitation Donations: The local public organizations of this county have no funds to support their regular expenses. Previously, the second administrative meeting of this county decided to collect scripture recitation donations to offset the regular expenses of the public organizations. The county submitted it to the province for approval. The collection methods and the amount to be collected were drafted by the Finance Bureau. Yesterday (26th), the county convened representatives from local agencies and monks and Taoists to discuss it. It is reported that the draft regulations drafted by the Finance Bureau have been revised and approved. The amount of donations to be collected is as follows: Whether monks and Taoists are invited to homes or go to temples to recite scriptures, the donation is 1 yuan for one day, 2 yuan for five days, 4 yuan for seven days, 8 yuan for nine days, 20 yuan for collecting scriptures, and 50 yuan for water and land Taoist temples. The aforementioned donations are collected by the undertaking temples, monks, and Taoists from the guests and hosts, and the Finance Bureau's collection personnel in each district are informed three days in advance to submit the donations and issue receipts, which are transferred to the hosts for collection. The donations are collected monthly by the Finance Bureau and delivered to the public funds and public property management office for safekeeping and disbursement upon notice. The implementation date is not far off.</p>
<p>Suspected Theft Case Found to be Unrelated: The Wang family, a villager in the Tianma Mountain area, was robbed of money and rice and stabbed in mid-March. After investigation, the detective team arrested Yang A and Hua Jingyun and found the stolen goods, which were sent to the county government for interrogation. During the preliminary trial, Liu confessed that Wang Xiaodi, a local, was also involved. The bailiff arrested Wang and sent him to the county jail. However, the victim Wang Ziqin had previously identified Liu in court as the perpetrator without error. The county government again summoned the victim yesterday (26th) to identify the suspect. The result was still the same as the previous confession. Regarding the Wang Xiaodi who was implicated, he said that he had not seen him at the scene. After the interrogation, he was ordered to be returned to custody for review.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Rabid Dog Bites a Large Number of People and Animals: Zhang Yunquan, a farmer in the Maotang Village, Xiwaigang Township, west of the county, owns a foreign dog. The dog was extremely docile. Yesterday (25th), it suddenly became abnormal and its eyes turned red. It bit people whenever it saw them. In one day, it injured six members of Zhang's family, three children from the Zhu family next door, and one cow and one sheep from the Ye family. The dog was then killed by the villagers. The injured people went to Wolf Mountain in groups to ask Dr. Yin, who specializes in treating rabies, for diagnosis.</p>
<p>Attempted Suicide After Quarrel Rescued: Wang Ruilin, son of Wang Gengchou of Mubiaobang, east of Anting Town, works as a clerk in a store in Shanghai. He married a woman surnamed Huang five years ago and they were still on good terms. Yesterday, Ruilin returned home for no reason. His father scolded him for loitering and then vented his anger on his wife, slapping her painfully. Huang fell to the ground and had no outlet for her frustration. She happened to find rabies medicine in the room and swallowed a cup. Soon her complexion changed drastically. Her in-laws noticed and accompanied her to the town's sanatorium for treatment. She vomited and recovered.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Continued Rice Stabilization Efforts: The second phase of the warehouse management committee recently stated that the price of rice continued to rise. Although the first phase has already been launched, it is a drop in the bucket. Moreover, at this time of year, when farmers are in need of capital for planting, it is also necessary to provide relief. Therefore, it was specially proposed and passed by the county administrative meeting to continue the efforts. However, the budgeted funds in the harvest field rent item only have a remaining balance of more than 4,400 yuan, plus a negligible amount of more than 2,770 yuan in the cabinet. There are no other funds. Whether to use the warehouse funds or raise donations from gentry and wealthy people is a matter that needs to be discussed urgently. It is planned to request the county to convene a local meeting to resolve it.</p>
<p>Police Team Assists in Neighboring County's Theft Case: After the Shengzimiao robbery case in Songjiang County, a neighboring area, occurred, Ding Zhiyan, the captain of the county police brigade, went to investigate the next morning together with Li Zhibin, the director of the county public security bureau. According to Yang Xiaosheng, the squad leader of the police substation stationed in the village, he reported that he heard the alarm at 10:00 p.m. that night and immediately led the police team to rush to intercept. One team also took three routes to surround them, including Daijiaqiao, Yanduntou, and Zhangjiatang. However, at that time, there was no support and they were limited by their strength. They dared not pursue them in the dark. After investigating the bandits' trail, according to the villagers who witnessed them, they said that they landed from the northwest Yexie along the Huangpu River and ran to the town along a shortcut that connects the Zhangtang Township between Songjiang and Fengxian counties. The town is only separated from Fengxian by a river, so the robbers had already guarded the bridge in front of the town to prevent an attack from Fengxian. By the time the team arrived, the robbers had already fled in separate directions in the district of Songjiang, Fengxian, and Nanhui counties. County Magistrate Shen Qingchen believes that although this case occurred in Songjiang, the area is adjacent to each other and is inevitably affected. Moreover, in order to comply with the joint defense, he specially announced a temporary curfew yesterday in the towns bordering each other. He also ordered Captain Ding to be responsible for assisting in the pursuit. At the same time, Chen, the district chief of the First River Police District, also ordered Wang Jinchuan, the captain of the Third Sub-Team stationed in Fengxian, to conduct a thorough search in order to solve the case.</p>
<h3>Jinshan</h3>
<p>Taibao A-shu is Active Again: Taibao A-shu and his gang of bandits were defeated by the military police before and fled back to Liujia Yanqiao, hiding in the countryside. They had already dispersed, but unexpectedly they have gathered again. There are a total of 300 people, falsely claiming to be the Songhu Guerrilla Team. They are equipped with fast guns, box cannons, mobile machine guns, and various other weapons. These people can be found in Wan Chunqiao, Lijia Langxia, Qianjia Wei, Tangjia Qiao, and Kongjia Que. They make a living by robbing and extorting. All well-to-do families have received threatening letters from these people. The residents are disturbed by this and are relocating one after another. It is also heard that Yan Shusheng, Zhu A-mei, Dai Kechang, Xu A-jin, Xi Daoming, Zhu Guitang, and A-ye are all small leaders under Taibao A-shu.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Director of Education Sued: Yang Lucun, director of the Education Bureau of this county, was sued by Guo, a student from Qingpu at Shanghai Great China University. Previously, the student applied to the Education Bureau for a loan, but it was not accepted. He repeatedly requested an explanation of the doubts, but no reply was given. Guo and others believed that the education authorities had violated the loan regulations and listed the places where the Education Bureau did not comply with the regulations. They requested the county government to investigate and verify the matter in order to comply with the purpose of the loan, so that poor students would not be disappointed. Shen Xiaoxian's Family in Pingqiao Robbed: At about 8:00 p.m. on the day before yesterday, more than ten robbers suddenly came to the home of Shen Xiaoxian, a farmer in Pingqiao Township, Qingpu County. Two robbers with guns guarded the door, three robbers stood on the north bank to watch, and the remaining robbers broke into the house. Shen knew something was wrong and jumped out of the back window, crossed the river, and fled. After searching, the robbers took the loot and left. The Baihejiang Security Corps heard the news and sent a team to rush there, but the robbers had already fled far away.</p>
<p>Jealousy Leads to a Brawl: Dong Baisheng, the owner of a barbershop on Matou Street in this county, and his wife, A-qiao, had an affair with a Sheng, a coppersmith at Hu Wanchang's coppersmith shop, for several years. A-qiao, seeing that her husband was easy to deceive, also had an affair with Zhu, a barber, which led to the two adulterers fighting over jealousy and being unable to stand each other. At about 8:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, they first had a talk at the Tongle Teahouse, and then the police stopped them and dispersed them invisibly. Unexpectedly, Sheng passed by the barbershop the next night, and A-qiao suddenly grabbed Sheng and slapped him in the face. The street chief came out to mediate and they dispersed. Not long after, Sheng invited more than ten ruffians to rush into the shop and start a brawl. The police heard the sound and came to arrest them all and sent them to the bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Two armed bandits were apprehended: Yesterday (the 26th) at around 8:00 AM, Wang Anren, patrol leader of the Water Patrol Team of the County Police, along with patrol officers Wang Kai, Han Fuzhen, and Peng Guojun, were inspecting passing boats near the Zao Shi Street outside Xumen. They saw a shabby boat with two suspicious-looking people on board. Patrol Leader Wang immediately ordered the boat to dock. The people on the boat looked flustered and continued to sail forward. Patrol Leader Wang pursued and found a gray bullet belt with thirty-four bullets in the stern cabin. They then found a 79 rifle in the bottom of the boat and immediately detained the two men. They identified themselves as Fang Dezhao from Xinyang, Henan, and Zhang Hongyou from Luoshan, Henan, stating that they intended to sail to Hengtang in Wujiang. Patrol Leader Wang, finding the two men highly suspicious, took them back to the team headquarters and prepared a document to send them to the Water Patrol Office for further investigation.</p>
<p>Daytime Robbery by Bandits at Pawnshop: A robbery occurred in broad daylight at the Dashun Pawnshop in Tieping Alley, inside Xumen, owned by local gentry Wu Zishen. Yesterday (the 26th) at approximately 10:45 AM, while the pawnshop was busy with transactions, a bandit wearing a black cloth jacket and pants, wielding a Mauser pistol, and speaking with a Hakka accent, entered the premises. The bandit jumped over the counter, startling the staff inside. The bandit told the shopkeeper, Wang Renlu, that he wanted ten thousand yuan. Wang replied that if he wanted money, he should go inside to the relief room to get it. The bandit, fearing it would be disadvantageous to enter alone, searched the relief counter and robbed the pawnshop of two hundred and forty yuan in Central Bank of China and Industrial Bank of China banknotes and over fifty yuan in silver dollars. He also stole a civilized nine-cheng gold bracelet weighing three qian three fen, and three gold rings, one weighing two qian one fen, one weighing one qian nine fen, and one weighing two qian four fen. The total value of the pawned items was thirty-six yuan. After stealing the gold jewelry, banknotes, and silver dollars, the bandit fled. Wu, the police officer, reported the incident to the West District Office and the security detective teams, who dispatched officers to apprehend the bandit, but he had already escaped. Neighbors near the pawnshop and across the street reported that they had seen three men enter the premises beforehand, with two acting as lookouts. Around 12:00 PM, a police officer from the 5th Sub-bureau of the Regiment Area arrested a suspect named Zhu Laosi in Sanliuwan. The manager of the pawnshop, Wang Xingchu, was called to identify the suspect, but he confirmed that Zhu Laosi was not the person who committed the robbery. Zhu Laosi was then transferred to the office for investigation. Around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the pawnshop staff found a Mauser pistol abandoned by the bandit in the alleyway inside the pawnshop. They immediately sent it to the West Third Sub-station for record-keeping.</p>
<p>Overall Plan of the County Public Safety Bureau: After the merger of the county and city Public Safety Bureaus, Director Xiao of the Public Safety Bureau has already finalized the overall plan for the Public Safety Bureau. In addition to merging the original five district offices in the urban area (East, South, West, North, and Central) into three sub-bureaus, the rural areas will be reorganized as follows: Huguan will become the Fourth Sub-bureau, Mudu the Fifth Sub-bureau, Hengjing the Sixth Sub-bureau, Dongqianshan the Seventh Sub-bureau, Danzhi the Eighth Sub-bureau, Huangdai the Ninth Sub-bureau, Xiangcheng the Tenth Sub-bureau, Weiting the Eleventh Sub-bureau, Chefang the Twelfth Sub-bureau, Guangfu the Thirteenth Sub-bureau, Xishan the Fourteenth Sub-bureau, and Chenmu the Fifteenth Sub-bureau. The original Lumu Sixth Sub-bureau of Wuxian County is now renamed the First Directly Subordinate Station. The original Lishu Fourteenth Sub-bureau of Wuxian County is now renamed the Second Directly Subordinate Station. The original Fengqiao Fourth Police Station of Wuxian County is now under the Second Sub-bureau, Third Subordinate Station. In addition to the two directly subordinate stations, there will be a total of twenty-nine subordinate stations.</p>
<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhizhong Inspects Troops in Jiang: Zhang Zhizhong, the Dean of Education of the Central Military Academy, arrived in Jiang on the 25th at 7:00 AM to inspect the entire battalion of soldiers and delivered a speech. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, he returned to Suzhou by boat.</p>
<p>Jinlun Cocoon Factory Completely Destroyed by Fire: The Nan Ku Jinlun Cocoon Factory suddenly caught fire on the morning of the 25th at 2:00 AM. The entire factory was burned down. It is reported that the loss, excluding the factory's assets, is estimated at around thirty thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Third Day of Cocoon Market Opening: The cocoon market in Wuxi has been open for three days. The amount of goods arriving on the market is more abundant than before, and the quality of the cocoons is also better. Cocoon prices are looking higher, with foreign varieties now priced at eighty yuan per dan. In Dongting Town, Lunhe, Gongtai, and Xiangxing are competing to purchase improved varieties, driving up the price from seventy-three yuan five jiao to eighty yuan. In Lishe, Yuqi, Xinqiao, Qianzhou, and other places, Yuankang, Yuanhe, Hecheng, Yongfeng, Changxin, and Lun are pricing improved varieties at seventy-five to eighty yuan per dan, and local varieties at fifty-five to sixty yuan. In Taixiang, Gansheng, and other shops, cocoon prices range from fifty-three yuan five jiao to sixty-three yuan five jiao, with improved varieties expected to reach seventy-five yuan. Cocoon prices in the Chenjiaqiao area are similar to the above. Zhangjingqiao, Hengyu, Tonghe, Hengfeng, and other shops are pricing improved varieties at around seventy yuan per dan and local varieties at fifty-four yuan five jiao. Yongtailong and Yuchang in the urban area are pricing cocoons at fifty to fifty-five yuan, and improved varieties at seventy-three yuan five jiao. Furthermore, the cocoon shops in Liyang, Meizhuang, Huili, Shangpeibu, Huimin, Shangxingbu, and Hongchang are all opened by the local Taifu Silk Factory. Since the opening on the 20th, due to the wait-and-see attitude of cocoon farmers, they have not been able to purchase smoothly. Each shop has only been receiving fifty to seventy dan of cocoons per day. On the 22nd, the arrival of goods surged. Local varieties were priced at fifty-eight yuan per dan, and improved varieties at sixty-one to sixty-two yuan. In recent days, the number of cocoons received by each shop has increased, with an estimated three hundred to five hundred dan of fresh cocoons being received per shop each day.</p>
<p>Further Report on the Shooting Case in Front of Bin's Residence: Song Shaolun, the guard of the former Civil Affairs Director Bin's residence, who was shot in the lungs by thugs on the night of the 24th, has been receiving treatment in the hospital. It has now been forty hours, and although he is still not out of danger, his condition has improved. If there are no further changes within three days, his life should be saved. According to Officer Song, in addition to the two assailants, there seemed to be two other people involved, one at Zhihe Bridge and one in Xidaoyuan Alley. One of the two assailants, wearing a short blue cloth shirt and pants, suddenly came to the door of Xu Linbao's house next door and asked how to get to the train station. He then asked when the city gates would be closed. I (Officer Song referring to himself) told him everything. He then inquired about the person's ethnicity. The person replied that he was from Xuzhou and had just come from Taihu Lake. He then asked if there were any vacancies in the Public Security Bureau and pointed to Miao's residence, asking whose house it was. I suspected his suspicious behavior and knew he was not a good person. I was about to draw my gun when the thug fired a shot. The first shot missed, but the second shot hit me in the body. I fired two shots, the first shot missed, and the thug fled. Bin recognized Officer Song's bravery and specially gave him fifty yuan for medical expenses and entrusted Dean Li Kele of Puren Hospital to take special care of him. Since the incident, in addition to ordering the water and land police to strictly apprehend the perpetrators and strengthen prevention, the County Government, considering the importance of the South Gate, has specially provided Mauser pistols to the guards there to enhance their defense.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Construction Department Inspects Xichang Road: The Jiangsu Construction Department specially dispatched Yu Tongfu, the chief engineer of the Provincial Highway Bureau, to Wuxi to inspect the Yichang Provincial Highway and the Xichang Road route. He, along with Director Yao Dixin of the Construction Bureau, Section Chief Huang Dechun, and Jiang Housheng, the director of the re-measurement committee, first thoroughly inspected the Tonghui Road, Guangqin Road, and Huishan Avenue connecting to Kaiyuan Road. They believed that it could be connected to the Yichang Provincial Highway in the future as a provincial highway. However, since long-distance buses will be operating in the future, sidewalks five feet wide must be built on both sides. The height and width will be determined after precise measurements. After the inspection, they went to Dongting Town to inspect the new and old routes from Dongting to Yacheng Bridge. Villagers from Xiaozhuyuan Bridge, where the new and old routes intersect, also sent representatives to submit maps of the new and old routes for review. Engineer Yu and others conducted a detailed survey. They found that the bridges built over the rivers and ponds in the new line were about twenty zhang wide, making the project too large and incompatible with the Construction Department's plans. Furthermore, it had to pass through Xinzhonghe River, Beihe River, Qianren Pit, Luodun River, Liujiabang Canal, and other low-lying areas, which would hinder water conservancy. The old line was more direct. However, the old line also needed to be precisely re-measured before a decision could be made. After discussion, it was decided to measure the old line. After both lines are determined, they will return to the city.</p>
<p>Misfortune of Prisoners in the County Prison: The county prison and detention center are unusually narrow, and the overcrowding of prisoners makes the air foul. Recently, prisoners in the detention center have been dying one after another. Yesterday, two prisoners, Lin Wensun, accused of unfilial conduct, and Huang Baolin, accused of opium offenses, died of starvation in prison. Judicial Director Wu Hou went to examine the bodies and arranged for coffins for burial. Five opium offenders in the same facility, the monk Xue Shuliang, Jiang, Gu Tingfan, and Gu Laowu, are also seriously ill. One of the monks died of starvation in prison last month. Jiang was granted bail for medical treatment but died within two days. Gu Tingfan was granted bail by the county government yesterday to seek medical treatment outside.</p>
<p>White-Haired Old Man Hangs Himself: Gong Renqing, 67 years old, a resident of No. 24 Jiyuli Lane near Dahechi outside the North Gate of the county, worked as a private school teacher. The day before yesterday, he went to Shanghai to discuss the house problem with his son, Fuchun, and then returned to Wuxi. Yesterday (the 26th) at around 9:00 AM, for some unknown reason, Renqing hanged himself in the room. His wife discovered him, but he was already dead. The scene was tragic. His wife immediately sent a letter to Shanghai to notify his son, Fuchun, to return home to handle the funeral arrangements. It is also said that the deceased's older brother, Gong, also hanged himself many years ago, which is considered strange.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Discovery of Bandits in Gaozi Township: In the southern part of Gaozi Township, several bandits, numbering over sixty, have been discovered in recent days. They hide during the day and come out at night, and cases of kidnapping have been reported from time to time, even burning down village houses. The residents there are quite panicked because they are being disturbed at the time of wheat harvest. In addition to reorganizing the defense corps to strengthen prevention, the village directors have also telegraphed the province to dispatch troops to protect them.</p>
<p>Carelessness at Dingfengyong Silk Factory: At around 4:00 PM on the 25th, a fire broke out in the cocoon drying room of the Dingfengyong Silk Factory. Dozens of stones of dry cocoons and twelve houses were burned down. The fire was extinguished by various fire brigades. The two individuals responsible for the fire, Cai Guangyu and Zhang Bingkun, have been sent to the Seventh Branch Office by the factory. It is reported that the factory's loss is approximately twenty thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Opening of the Zhenjiang County Representative Assembly: The third Zhenjiang County Representative Assembly was held yesterday at 2:00 PM. Thirty county representatives selected by various district branches attended the opening ceremony. Gu Ren, specially dispatched by the Provincial Party Headquarters, attended the meeting for guidance. Liu Jianqiu, Yu Wu, and Xiangshan served as the presidium. After the opening of the meeting, Liu Jianqiu reported on the purpose of the meeting, followed by a speech by the instructor from the Provincial Party Headquarters. Representatives from various agencies and organizations then spoke one after another. After the speeches, slogans were shouted and the meeting adjourned. It is scheduled to hold a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week this morning at 9:00 AM, followed by a discussion of proposals.</p>
<p>Provincial Public Safety Bureau Levies Sanitation Fee: The Provincial Public Safety Bureau believes that Zhenjiang, as the provincial capital, is densely populated and has thriving commerce. Public health services should be provided as much as possible to achieve perfection. However, since economics is the mother of reality, it is necessary to raise funds in advance to facilitate progress. A set of regulations and plans has been drafted, following the precedent of the capital, to implement a sanitation fee. It has been submitted to the Department of Civil Affairs and forwarded to the Provincial Government for approval. It is scheduled to start collecting fees on June 1st.

Hundreds of thousands of people are in danger of running out of rice. All public organizations in Hefei have telegraphed the Luyang Apartment in Shanghai to ask fellow villagers to find ways to purchase foreign rice and transport it to Hefei for relief, with half of the purchase price being shared by Hefei and Shanghai. The purchase and transportation are underway, which is good news for the disaster victims.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Competition Situation</p>
<h3>Men's Volleyball Championship</h3>
<p>Chinese Volleyball Team Wins Against Japan 2-1</p>
<p>First Set: 20-22</p>
<p>Second Set: 21-8</p>
<p>Third Set: 21-8</p>
<p>Unfair Refereeing, Chinese Skills Superior</p>
<p>Our newspaper's Tokyo, 26th dispatch - The first Sino-Japanese volleyball match began at 3:00 PM today amidst thunderous applause. A large cheering squad of Chinese students studying abroad came to the venue to cheer, and China won against Japan 2-1.</p>
<h3>Referee's Bias Causes China to Lose</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the first set, the Chinese players were inevitably shaken by the unfair decisions of the referee, as violations such as stepping on the line, touching the net, and crossing the net were repeatedly attributed to the Chinese players, resulting in a decrease in their performance. Japan took an early lead of 11-6. After switching sides, the Chinese team's Chen Xibing, Qiu Guangxie, and Cao Tingzan put on a magical performance, and soon took the lead with 15-11. At this time, the situation for both sides was tense, and the battle was fierce, with the scores tied multiple times. At this critical moment, another unfavorable decision was made against us, causing protests from the players and spectators. As a result, China lost 20-22.</p>
<h3>Defeating the Enemy and Achieving Victory is as Easy as Turning One's Hand</h3>
<p>After a short break, the competition resumed, and the Chinese team's momentum was smooth and advantageous. Japan fought hard, only managing to tie the score at 8-8. The Chinese team changed its tactics, and Li Yunying's left arm was accurate and powerful, beyond human remedy. The victory in the second set can be said to be as easy as turning one's hand. The score was 21-8.</p>
<h3>High Skills, Chinese Victory</h3>
<p>In the third set, both sides acted cautiously, valuing victory and defeat. Initially, the scores were tied at 3-3. Then, Chen, Li, and Cao launched a fierce attack, and the score suddenly increased. When all the balls were being supplied, they took a significant lead of 11-4. Japan was flustered, and the situation deteriorated greatly. Cao Tingzan's serves were successful, and the score soared to 18 points. After Japan added two points, Cao, Qiu, and Chen displayed their prowess, smashing the ball like a dense rain towards the gaps in the enemy's formation. The Japanese were caught off guard and overwhelmed, unable to attend to both ends. After 20-8, there was another round of competition between China and Japan. Finally, Qiu Guangxie's serve reached the end point, and China won again with 21-8. In summary, the Chinese players were fortunately calm and did not despair due to the unfair refereeing, ultimately achieving victory. There is no doubt that their skills are far superior to those of the Japanese. During the three sets, the Chinese cheering squad frequently shouted displeasure at the referee, and the players repeatedly protested the unfair decisions. During the third set, the referee specifically stopped the competition for a moment and declared that such actions by China should not occur during the competition, so as not to disrupt order and harm the overall situation.</p>

The Philippines remained determined and continued to work hard, tying the score at 13-13. Japan then declared a timeout to discuss strategy. In the renewed battle, both sides maintained a stalemate, each scoring 13 points in the first half.</p>
<h3>The Strong Ultimately Prevails</h3>
<p>After switching sides, the Philippines gained the upper hand, with the score becoming 19-13. Before long, the Philippines' momentum grew stronger, and the distance widened, reaching 29-19, as if the game was one-sided. The Japanese fought like cornered beasts, trying to recover, but the Philippines' defense was tight and attacking was difficult. Later, Japan's Uchiwe scored repeatedly with long shots, but time had already run out in the second half, and Japan lost 13-20.</p>

<h3>Osaka Track and Field Competition</h3>
<p>Japan's Wishful Thinking to Hold</p>
<p>China Has Never Allowed It</p>
<p>Japan Electric News, Tokyo, 26th: The athletes from China, Japan, the Philippines, and India participating in the Far Eastern Games were originally scheduled to hold a track and field competition in Osaka on June 1st and 2nd after the Games. Recently, the Chinese athletes have declared to the Coordination League that they will not participate due to events. After the end of the Games, the Chinese athletes will travel to Nikko and other scenic spots before returning home. The League has relied on various institutions to provide all kinds of conveniences.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) The four countries holding track and field competitions in Osaka after the Games is Japan's wishful thinking. China has never allowed it. How can it be said that "China has suspended its participation"?</p>
<p>Japan's Ambition to Increase Championships</p>
<p>Wishful Thinking to Divide Field and Track Events into Two Championships</p>
<p>Swimming Added Five Individual Events and Women's Championship</p>
<p>Want to Use World Rules for Track and Field and Soccer</p>
<p>Our Country's Ma John Has Already Opposed It</p>
<p>Hope the Representatives Insist to the End</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 26th: The Far Eastern Games Constitutional Committee is scheduled to meet at 10:00 AM this morning in the special committee room of the Meiji Jingu Art Gallery. The representatives of each country participating in the meeting are as follows: China - Hao Boyang, Ma John; Japan - Yamamoto Tadaoki and related committee members; Philippines - Chawaga, Iranan, etc. The various rules of the competition will be negotiated and decided. Photo of Japanese track and field and women's volleyball athletes practicing.</p>
<p>The following will be submitted to the national representatives' committee for formal decision. The issues raised by the Japanese committee on this day are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) From the next Games onwards, world rules will be used for track and field events, but the Far Eastern rules will still be used for the shot put event in the next Games.</p>
<p>(2) The track and field event will be divided into three types of championships: field events, track events, and all-around events.</p>
<p>(3) From the next Games onwards, world rules will also be applied to swimming events, and because of the 1,500-meter freestyle event, a 50-meter long swimming pool should be used.</p>
<p>(4) In addition to the previous individual championships, five individual championships will be added, and women's swimming will also be a championship event: (1) 200-meter backstroke (2) 100-meter backstroke (3) 800-meter relay (4) springboard diving (5)</p>
<p>Water polo (women's swimming) (1) 50-meter freestyle (2) 100-meter freestyle (3) 400-meter freestyle (4) 200-meter relay (5) 100-meter backstroke (6) 200-meter backstroke (7) springboard diving</p>
<p>(5) The progress of baseball and the development of tactics require the use of pinch hitters and designated runners. Therefore, the traditional limit of 17 players will be changed to 20 players.</p>
<p>(6) The Davis Cup rules will be used for the tennis competition. (7) The world rules will be used for the soccer rules.</p>
<p>Before attending the Far Eastern Games Constitutional Committee, Ma Yugan, the chief leader of the Chinese delegation, told reporters: "You already know the current situation of the Chinese team, so our opinion is that we hope to maintain the status quo. This Games already has a large region, and the scope of sports is not yet complete. If we intentionally advance into new areas, the foundation of our country's sports world may fall into chaos. Therefore, we hope that we will wait until our country has made progress in the future before changing the rules."</p>
<h3>Talks by the Chief Representatives of the Three Countries</h3>
<p>(Ruan Weicai, Tokyo Correspondence)</p>
<p>The chief representatives of the three Far Eastern Games countries are now expressing their aspirations for the Games. The talks of the representatives of China, the Philippines, and Japan are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Boling of China</p>
<p>(I dare not make dogmatic pronouncements regarding the outcomes of this competition before the war is resolved, but I am confident that our team's skills in soccer, volleyball, and basketball are true. The Japanese baseball team is now specifically waiting for a showdown with China to determine who is the best. In the future, after the Sino-Japanese competition, our team's strength and level will be known. My hope is that the youth representatives from the four countries of China, Japan, the Philippines, and India will all do their best and engage in enjoyable competition, so that there can be a satisfactory conclusion. In the future, the Far Eastern Games will be further expanded into a Pan-Pacific Games, and China will certainly support it. Although the athletic strength of our country is difficult to compare with that of the advanced countries, we will definitely make every effort to make this pending case a reality.)</p>
<p>(2) Hugas of the Philippines</p>
<p>Philippine Chief Representative Hugas made the following remarks to reporters at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo:</p>
<p>(The Philippine representatives in this Games are indeed more outstanding than the athletes in the past Games. There is no other reason for this other than that our country's selection of athletes</p>
<p>Chinese female athletes practicing volleyball in Japan</p>
<p>Recently, we have all borrowed from the results of Japan. Although victory or defeat is difficult to predict, our country has considerable strength in all kinds of competitions. All the athletes practiced in a group camp before crossing the ocean. They practiced diligently all day long, even when it was rainy, and I am confident that they can avenge themselves in this Games. In short, we will use all our strength to fight this battle.)</p>
<h3>(3) Xingzhong Yamamoto (General Affairs Committee Member of the Games)</h3>
<p>(Young guests from China, the Philippines, and India are now gathered in our country's newly green capital. In the past, every Games suffered from the problem of unfair refereeing. Now, we are determined to make every effort to wash away this kind of difficulty and expect to create a model competition. This is a congratulatory matter. This Games first provides a great driving force for our country's sports world. Today's sports items are divided into eight categories, which is more appropriate than before, and it is also the first time in the history of the Games that a page of history has been left. Second, sports are the instinct of human struggle and the supreme morality. Reasonable travel can open up the friendship of mutual love and reveal pure and high social interaction. The most wonderful thing about this time is that India has come from afar to participate, expressing a good intention of affinity for our oriental people. In addition to ball skills, our country has 12 points of strength in all other sports, which can surpass the three countries. Our country is truly responsible as the elder brother for the true meaning of oriental friendship. On June 1st and 2nd, the national track and field competition will be held at Koshien in Osaka, so that the athletes sent by our country to the international arena can practice and relieve the longing of the people in Shin-Osaka. Finally, I tell the youth of the East to fight for the glory of your motherland and quickly come to this free world, a fair and impartial battlefield, and bless our future of the East, which will surely be able to leap into the world without restrictions.)</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>Japanese Management Does Not Recognize Chinese Athletes</p>
<p>Chinese Athletes' Appetites Scare the Japanese</p>
<p>Zhang Boling Limits the Interaction Between Male and Female Athletes</p>
<p>The doorside of the Japanese Youth Hall is marked with three scripts. On a wooden plaque it is written: "Far Eastern Games, lodging for athletes of India, Republic of China, Philippines, and Japan." Although it has a Japanese tone, it is not difficult for Chinese people to understand at a glance. The problem lies with India and the Philippines. Above the gate are painted the national flags of the four countries, and the national flags of the four countries are also hung on the roof, fluttering in the wind, which is very beautiful. Next to the gate is a large piece of paper on which is written: "No entry except for athletes." However, visitors from India and the Philippines still enter and exit freely because they do not understand the text. The staff feels very difficult, so they urgently changed the writing to Chinese, English, and Japanese, so all kinds of announcements must be written in three languages, and the Youth Hall has become a colorful place.</p>
<h3>Mistaken Identity</h3>
<p>Our country's athletes all live on the first and second floors, the Philippines on the third floor, Japan on the fourth floor, and India also on the fourth floor. There is a Mr. Ma from Guangdong who is as black as lacquer. The Japanese administrator mistook him for an Indian athlete. When he went upstairs, he stopped him in Japanese-style English and said: "You India don't go this place." Mr. Ma was very angry and said in fluent English: "I am a representative of China, not an Indian." The Japanese administrator only slightly understood one or two sentences of English. At this point, he was stunned and did not know what to say. On the contrary, because Mr. Ma's English was proficient, he was more convinced that he was an Indian athlete and stopped him even more forcefully. The two sides were entangled in a mess. Fortunately, someone came urgently and explained in Japanese, and the storm was calmed.</p>
<h3>Sincere Hospitality</h3>
<p>The Japan Sports Association specially set up a reception committee for athletes from all countries to Japan to be responsible for all recruitment responsibilities. When our country's male and female athletes arrived, the entire committee went to receive them. Our country's female athletes stayed at the Japan YWCA, and the Japanese receptionists rushed back and forth, not shirking their hard work, which can be said to be truly sincere hospitality. Those who went to the YWCA competed for the opportunity to be sent, making the head of the reception department, Mr. N, very troubled. A reporter once asked someone in the committee for the reason. Mr. A, who had spent all his energy but had not been dispatched, wrote the four words (窈窕淑女君子好逑) and said: "When the Chinese female athletes speak to me, I am very happy and reply very earnestly. After all, the Philippine women are not as good as the Chinese."</p>
<h3>Eating Problems</h3>
<p>The Japanese are known worldwide for their small appetites. Chinese students in Japan are often called "rice buckets" by the Japanese (meaning they eat too much, not that they are useless). Generally, Chinese people eat about twice as much as Japanese people. When I interviewed members of the reception committee about their impressions of the Chinese athletes, Mr. K said that the Chinese male athletes ate too much. He saw a certain soccer player eat twenty-four large steamed buns in one go, which was astonishing. If all Chinese people were like him, he thought China would definitely face a food shortage. The Japanese tend to be surprised by small things. If the Japanese saw the amount of food that laborers in northern China eat, wouldn't they be scared to death? So I went to that athlete to investigate the truth. The athlete said that the steamed buns made by the Japanese were too small. If he didn't eat two in one bite, he didn't feel satisfied. That day he only ate twelve bites. The words of the two gentlemen are so far apart that it's truly ridiculous.</p>
<h3>Fifteen Minutes</h3>
<p>This time, the staff of our national athletic delegation were extremely serious about management. Whenever an athlete went out, they had to ask the head coach, Mr. John Ma, for leave. Yao Enhan, a basketball star, happened to have a guest coming and wanted to go to dinner with him, so he asked for leave. Mr. Ma firmly refused. Yao was so anxious that he raised his hands high above his forehead and bowed deeply, saying, "Only fifteen minutes, just this once, and I won't do it again." Only then did he get his wish. The next morning, I asked Yao if it really was fifteen minutes. He replied that it was more than two hours.</p>
<h3>Doctor Worries</h3>
<p>Because our male athletes are unfamiliar with the place and have nowhere to go for recreation, they often secretly take cars to the Japanese Women's Christian Association to visit the female athletes and talk. At the same time, the female athletes go to the youth center for practice and meet with the male athletes. Socializing is frequent. Around the Meiji Jingu Outer Garden, male and female athletes can often be seen strolling among the trees. Chief Representative Dr. Zhang Boling and General Secretary Hao Boyang worried that they would neglect their training because of this. They held repeated meetings to discuss countermeasures. Zhang said, "Those kids are too much! You should be impolite and forbid them!" Hao said, "Male and female interaction should be absolutely free, but if they don't stay within limits and something goes wrong, I, surnamed Hao, won't be able to take responsibility, and it will implicate you, old sir." After discussing the matter, they decided to forbid anyone from going out without a special reason. After the order was issued, the male and female athletes shouted that it was a disappointment.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Philippine Female Athletes Unite in Joy (Zeng Yanhua, Tokyo Correspondence)</h3>
<p>The female athletes from China and the Philippines are both staying at the Tokyo Women's Christian Association in Kanda Surugadai. On the 18th, they had just unpacked their luggage and were answering questions about this foreign land. On the morning of the 19th, at 9:00 AM, they were led by their coaches to the Jingu Athletic Field and the volleyball court for practice. They didn't return to the dormitory until about 3:00 PM. Due to the long journey by boat and car, they were all tired. That night, it happened to be raining, so they gathered in groups of three or five after dinner, chatting and laughing. Some were talking with visiting friends, some were buying Japanese scenic postcards to write and send back to their home countries, and some were frequently asking the enthusiastic Japanese female reception committee members about what they needed to learn. The Philippine athletes practiced swimming.</p>
<p>For a while, the Women's Christian Association suggested opening the gymnasium. Suddenly, a Philippine lady was seen holding a ukulele, singing and playing. In an instant, everyone joined in. Some played the piano, others played other instruments to harmonize. They immediately formed a jazz band and invited each other to dance lightly. The Chinese Li sisters also sang sweet Nanyang tunes. Dancing and singing mingled until 9:30 PM. In this happy and harmonious atmosphere, all thoughts of being from different lands were broken down. It can be called a beautiful prelude to the Far Eastern Games.</p>

<h3>City Education Director Chen Dezheng's Proposal to Reclaim Educational Rights in the Shanghai Concessions</h3>
<p>Chen Dezheng, the director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, has been working hard to reclaim educational rights in the concessions. Here is his proposal to reclaim educational rights in the Shanghai concessions: (Reasons) The right to education is a national right. Reclaiming the right to education is reclaiming national rights. There are two purposes: one is to stop foreign cultural aggression, and the other is to promote our country's inherent culture. The nation and the state have a close relationship. The Shanghai concession area is relatively large, with 300,000 school-age children. There are only a few public schools, less than five or six, with only about 2,000 students, and they are poorly run. Most private schools are decadent and difficult to manage. As for social education, there is not only no provision, but also many things that hinder society, such as publications that teach lewdness and thievery, dramas that trap the nation, prostitutes who sell their smiles at the door, and gambling that leads people to depravity, all of which are everywhere. Therefore, the reclamation of educational rights in the Shanghai concession should not be delayed for a moment. (Methods) It is proposed that representatives from the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the municipal government, the municipal party department, the municipal education bureau, and the Chinese directors of the concessions form a committee to reclaim educational rights in the Shanghai concessions to carry out all matters. The methods are divided into the first year as the reception period, engaging in publicity, negotiation, and reception; the second year as the organization period, engaging in investigation, statistics, and consultation on educational expenses; and the third year as the expansion period, with the plan based on the proposals of the Second National Education Conference. Proposer: Chen Dezheng</p>

<h3>Preparatory Committee Members</h3>
<p>Nie Lusheng, Chen Riping, Cai Shengbai, Shen Huachen, Chen Yiting, Pan Gongzhan, Dai Gengxin, Tong Jitong, Qian Chengxu, Liu Hongsheng, Rong Zongjing, Yang Xingfo, Mu Ouchu, Liu Zhanen, Xia Xiaofang, Chen Zongcheng, Lu Fei Bohong, Hu Shuhua, Wang Boqi, Pan Xulun, Sun Ruihuang, Xu Peikun, Xu Jiqing, Li Quanshi, Shou Yicheng, Dai Ailu, Xu Yongzuo, Chen Wanyun, Chen Jun, etc. (29 in total) were appointed as preparatory committee members.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>I am deeply pleased that all of you comrades have come to the preparatory meeting of the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association today. The underdevelopment of China's industry and the backwardness of production are due to the lack of appropriate management methods, the shortage of technical personnel, the unsoundness of enterprise organizations, and the lack of research on personnel administration. To seek improvement, we should take the cultivation of technical personnel and the implementation of scientific management as a common goal to strive for. Scientific management of industrial and commercial enterprises originated in the United States and spread to various countries. In the United States, this management method was first created by Mr. F.W. Taylor, an efficiency expert in the US industry. Therefore, it is also called Taylorism. His method was recognized by general industrial leaders after thirty-five years of research and advocacy by Taylor. Its main points can be summarized into four aspects: (1) Discover scientific laws based on practical experience so that each part or individual in the factory has appropriate work, and special attention should be paid to the research of time and action and the elimination of waste of materials. (2) Apply scientific methods to select, guide, and train workers, with the main purpose of choosing jobs for workers rather than allowing workers to choose their own jobs. (3) Management personnel should share weal and woe with workers and be sincere with each other, so that all work is carried out according to the principles of scientific industrial efficiency. (4) Management and labor should both bear considerable responsibility for their occupations. All work that workers can do should be done by workers. Otherwise, it should be done by the management in order to achieve the practical effect of division of labor and cooperation. In 1921, when US Secretary of Commerce Hoover (the current US President) took office, he also organized a Committee on the Elimination of Waste. The scope of its investigation was very broad, and it sought to fundamentally eliminate all kinds of waste in raw materials, transportation, management, and sales. Therefore, it can be said to be a large-scale scientific management movement, or a rationalization movement of economic undertakings in a broad sense. This is a summary of the recent development history of the scientific management movement in the United States. Internationally, the International Scientific Management Conference, which was initially temporary in nature, was followed by the establishment of the International Industrial and Commercial Management Association. The International Scientific Management Conference was held in Brussels in 1925, but because important industrial countries did not send representatives to attend, it did not achieve any significant results. The second meeting (1926) was held in Paris and became a fully international scientific management organization. The third meeting was held in Rome, with more than 1,300 representatives and 176 reports, which were extremely informative and marked a new era in the international movement for scientific management. The fourth meeting was held in Paris, with participants from 35 countries and more than 1,500 representatives. The President of France and the Ministers of Labor and Internal Affairs all attended, and Mrs. Taylor, the wife of Mr. Taylor, the founder of scientific management in the United States, also personally participated. The discussion content was divided into six categories: (1) Industry (2) Agriculture (3) Commerce (4) Administration (5) Family Economics (6) Education and General Issues. All of these are temporary gatherings. As for the establishment of a permanent international scientific management research institution, it began with the establishment of the International Scientific Management Association in Geneva in 1927. The association was jointly organized by the International Labor Bureau, the US Twentieth Century Economic Research Foundation, and the European Scientific Management Association. For more than three years, the governments of various countries and important industrial groups have successively joined, totaling 29 countries and 345 institutions. The purposes are: (1) to improve the organization of industrial and commercial enterprises; (2) to improve the efficiency of industrial and commercial production; (3) to collect data on scientific management research; (4) to facilitate the exchange of opinions among entrepreneurs and industrialists. This is a brief history of the international scientific management movement. The importance of scientific management is something that all researchers of industrial and commercial administration can talk about. In this industrial era, advocacy and implementation cannot be delayed. The administrative outline of the Ministry has long been included, and it is being prepared to convene industrial leaders and industrial and commercial experts to jointly plan for implementation. It has just received a letter from the International Scientific Management Association in Geneva, requesting that we initiate the organization of a China Industrial and Commercial Management Association in order to join it as a member and seek full cooperation and common development. The matter concerns the future of industry and commerce and relies on gathering ideas and benefiting from each other. I hope that all of you gentlemen will express your opinions and actively prepare to achieve success on schedule. This will be a blessing for the Ministry and for all sectors of industry and commerce. Minister Kong went to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Rescue Team to Depart</h3>

<h3>Consolidated Records of Weekly Memorial Services at Various Institutions</h3>
<p>The City Executive Committee held its sixth Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Weekly Service yesterday at 9:30 AM, attended by over 200 staff members and guests. Chairman Fan Zhengbo and Cai Hongtian reported on the Party affairs and political situation of the past week. The service then concluded.</p>
<p>The Garrison Headquarters held Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Weekly Service for all officers at 9:00 AM yesterday in the main auditorium. Commander Xiong presided and led the ceremony. The Commander spoke on the personality of revolutionaries, stating that in a country, there is a division of labor, and in the military, there is a hierarchy. This leads to differences in compensation and status. On the surface, this may seem unequal, but in reality, it is entirely due to differences in individual abilities and knowledge. It cannot be said to be unequal. Therefore, a country or army must have a proper division of labor to be a well-organized entity and exert great power. Furthermore, regardless of the amount of compensation or the height of one's status, everyone is equal in terms of personality. A division commander and a soldier must both have the personality of a revolutionary, and they must especially dedicate themselves to cultivating their personalities to be worthy of being revolutionary soldiers.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Offers Free Wireless Telegraph Service</h3>

<h3>Commercial Reorganization Committee Requests Punishment for Unauthorized Arrest Case</h3>
<p>Separate Letters to Party, Government, and Military Agencies</p>
<p>The Commercial Reorganization Committee, based on the resolution of the 13th Plenary Committee, sent separate letters to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, requesting punishment for the unauthorized arrest of pharmacy workers. The original letter stated: "The Shanghai Pharmacy Workers' Union has privately arrested Feng Jinpu, manager of Feng Cunde Pharmacy, and Song Fuchen, deputy manager of Tong Hanchun Pharmacy. On the 19th of this month, we combined the case and sent a letter to your department to investigate, stop, and punish them. Now, at the 13th Plenary Committee meeting of our committee on the 23rd of this month, this case was brought up in detail. They do not have the right to arrest people at the same level. Now, instead of resolving the dispute through the competent authorities according to the law, they hastily labeled the store's legal petition as reactionary and abused their power to detain them, hoping to expand their power and make the store dare not exercise its legal right to petition. The arrogance of the working class has reached this point is unprecedented. If they are not punished according to law, what is the bottom line for the store's suffering? Therefore, it was unanimously decided to request the party and government agencies to punish the Pharmacy Workers' Union for the two unauthorized arrests of the pharmacy manager according to law in the case. We have recorded the case and submitted a letter for your review and approval in order to maintain human rights."</p>
<h3>Workers at Anderson Electric Material Factory Went on Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>More Than 800 Workers Did Not Arrive at the Factory Yesterday</p>
<p>Workers' Demands Have Been Submitted</p>
<p>Starting at 7:00 AM yesterday, all workers at the Anderson Electric Material Factory on Labour Road went on strike. More than 800 male and female workers did not arrive at the factory for work. A labor dispute also occurred at the factory on January 11th of this spring. Four workers were injured by bullets in the confusion during the meeting, causing a major uproar. The dispute was only resolved after the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau worked hard to mediate. However, the factory did not recognize the "Anderson Electric Material Factory Union" organized by the workers. On the 8th of this month, the union submitted 15 demands for improved treatment. The factory stated that the matter was of great importance and required further consideration, and did not immediately respond. However, the factory announced 17 work regulations that the entire factory workers must abide by. The two standing committee members of the union, Huang Yinda and Ji Guizhen, were dismissed for some reason. Seeing this situation, the workers felt dissatisfied and immediately organized a strike committee. The entire strike began in the early morning. Ren Liping, the chief of the Caojiadu Sixth District Public Security Bureau in charge of the area, rushed to inspect the strike situation upon hearing the news. After arriving at the gate, he saw several Chinese and foreign police officers from the concession standing guard and felt very strange. After meeting with the factory manager, Pan Qi, he immediately informed him that Labour Road belonged to the Chinese territory and that the Anderson Electric Material Factory should be protected by the Public Security Bureau. There was no need for the concession police to overstep their authority and guard the gate. The Chinese and foreign police officers guarding the gate should be withdrawn immediately to respect Chinese police power. Manager Pan Qi immediately informed the police officers to withdraw, and the armed police officers from the Sixth District Public Security Bureau were sent to protect the order of the workers. The order was very good and there was no transgression. In addition to submitting the demands to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau for negotiation with the factory, they are waiting for a solution. The factory hopes that the workers will resume work in the shortest possible time to maintain the good relationship between labor and management over the years.</p>
<h3>Documents for Applying for Change of Nationality Must Include the Original Foreign Name</h3>
<p>Do Not Only List the Chinese Translation of Foreign Names</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior investigated that the various agencies that previously handled nationality matters only listed the Chinese translations of foreign names and place names in the various documents submitted for approval to change nationality, without listing the original foreign names. The listed Chinese translations also had different characters with the same sound, resulting in different meanings before and after, making it impossible to verify. Therefore, it has consulted this Municipal Government to instruct the agencies handling nationality matters to order them to note the original foreign names under the Chinese translations when accepting various documents for applying for change of nationality. After verification, the documents should be forwarded to avoid ambiguity and facilitate investigation. After approving the consultation, the Municipal Government immediately instructed the Public Security Bureau to instruct the Foreign Affairs Section to comply with the instructions.</p>

<h3>The National Defence Corps Will Implement Political Training</h3>
<p>The Training Plan Has Been Approved by the Executive Committee</p>
<p>And Forwarded to the Municipal Government to Order All Corps to Comply</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Special City National Defence Corps has assisted the police in maintaining law and order. It made great contributions to the recapture of Shanghai by the Party Army in 1925. Therefore, local people attach great importance to it. Recently, the Legislative Yuan passed the National Defence Corps Law, stipulating that in addition to military training, political training must also be implemented. The Central Government convened a national training conference and also decided that people's armed groups should be trained by the Party Headquarters. It can be seen that political training is essential for the National Defence Corps. The Municipal Party Headquarters started planning last month and formulated an implementation plan with detailed measures. It has been approved by the Standing Committee of the Municipal Executive Committee and forwarded to the Municipal Government to notify all corps to comply. The original text of the plan is recorded below:</p>
<p>A Brief Explanation of the Shanghai Special City National Defence Corps' Political Training Implementation Plan</p>
<p>The current status of the National Defence Corps members is stipulated in the Military Service Law as training for quasi-reserve military service or reserve military service. The principle is to implement universal military service to help the conscription system. Their service is to assist the police in maintaining law and order and eliminating reactionaries in peacetime, and to assist the army in resisting foreign aggression and quell crises in wartime. Their training is based on familiarity with military affairs, understanding politics, and understanding party principles as regular cultivation work, and to develop a people's armed force with academic and principled knowledge. In addition to receiving military training, it is even more important for National Defence Corps members to implement political training and instill party principles. According to the County National Defence Corps Law passed by the Legislative Yuan, military training and political training are each given equal importance with the establishment of specialists. Its significance is profound and obvious. The ability of the National Revolution to unify the country in a short period of time is due to the equal importance of military training and political training. At that time, the warlord troops were ten times more numerous, but they were ultimately eliminated because their success or failure depended on having principles or not. At this time when the great powers are surrounding us and the national shame is waiting to be washed away, the supreme principle of building the country with the Party is to lay the foundation of China on a solid rock, and it is impossible not to cultivate a people's armed force that is revolutionary in the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, this Ministry has formulated an implementation training plan based on the resolution passed by the Central Training Department at this year's National Training Conference that "people's armed groups shall be guided and trained by the local highest Party Headquarters" in order to achieve the aforementioned goals. (A) General Outline (1) The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters Training Department formulates the implementation plan for the political training of the National Defence Corps in this city based on the resolution passed by the National Training Conference that "people's armed groups shall be guided and trained by the local senior Party Headquarters". (2) The National Defence Corps in this city shall establish one political training officer for each corps in accordance with the County National Defence Corps Law passed by the Legislative Yuan. (3) The qualifications of political training officers must be those who have political knowledge, understand the Three Principles of the People, and have been qualified by this Ministry. (4) Based on this plan, the Shanghai Special City Government is consulted to order all National Defence Corps to comply. (B) Training Objectives (1) Popularize political knowledge and instill the Three Principles of the People. (2) Increase the power of principles in addition to the power of military force. (3) Develop a legitimate people's armed force to eliminate all reactionary forces in society. (C) Training Preparation (1) Investigate the number of people and service situation of each National Defence Corps resident in the city. (2) Convene a meeting of the persons in charge of each National Defence Corps to discuss the equipment for the implementation of training. (3) Prepare training materials. (D) Training Materials (1) The Three Principles of the People (2) The Outline of National Reconstruction (3) The Strategies of National Reconstruction (4) The Spiritual Education of Soldiers (5) The History of Imperialist Aggression (6) Other analyses and methods for eliminating reactionary forces. (E) Training Implementation (1) After the political training officers of each National Defence Corps have been examined and appointed, the headquarters will convene a meeting to guide the implementation. (2) The training time and location shall be stipulated by each political training officer according to the circumstances of their respective corps. (3) Stipulate the training courses, with a minimum of two hours of instruction per week. (4) During the training period, this headquarters will send personnel to inspect each corps at any time. (F) Training Performance Evaluation (1) Conduct an examination once every three months. (2) The headquarters will conduct a general assessment once a year and reward or punish them separately. (3) Conduct a grand review when necessary. (4) The examination methods and reward and punishment standards will be determined separately.</p>

<h3>Hunan National Products Exhibition Hall Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Collect Items</h3>
<p>The Hunan Provincial Government has established a special office to prepare for the National Products Exhibition Hall and sent special item collection commissioners Deng Luyun and Chen Jizhuang to Shanghai yesterday. The letter was sent to the Commercial Reorganization Committee and the Commodity Exhibition Hall for a visit. Lin Zimao, the director of the Commodity Exhibition Hall, sincerely received them and requested that they provide as much assistance as possible in the item collection matters. He also mentioned that the Hunan National Products Exhibition Hall is located in the prosperous center of Changsha City, covering more than 20 acres. More than 200,000 yuan in funding has been arranged and an eight-story building is being built, which is very grand in scale. In addition to setting up various exhibition departments, it is also planned to add a national products mall and amusement park. It is heard that the Commercial Reorganization Committee has agreed to provide considerable support. The letter is recorded as follows: "Sir, displaying national products is the only way to encourage industry and recover rights, and it is deeply and greatly related to the development of China's industry and commerce. Our office is responsible for the mission of displaying national products. Regarding the collection of items, we are now actively conducting it. In addition to submitting requests to our Provincial Government to separately consult the Party Headquarters, county and municipal governments, and chambers of commerce at all levels inside and outside the province, we have also directly sent personnel to widely solicit from major factories, companies, shops, and schools in the country. We have always admired your association's great promotion of national products and express our deep sympathy. Therefore, we have specially sent collection personnel Deng Luyun and Chen Jizhuang to come here and hope that you will give them assistance to strengthen their forces and broaden the search. This will be a great public service. Sincerely yours, Shanghai Special City Commercial Reorganization Committee."</p>
<h3>Recent Tax Revenue of the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Public Concession announced that the total revenue from general taxation from January to April of this year totaled 3.3 million taels, of which the real estate tax was the largest.</p>
<p>There is still news from this city on the following page.</p>

<h3>The Special District Court Hears the May 30th Compensation Case</h3>
<p>The Plaintiff Sues for Embezzlement</p>
<p>The Purpose Is Only to Recover the Funds</p>
<p>The Hearing Will Continue After All Witnesses Are Detained</p>
<p>Luo Wenlang's younger brother, Luo Wenzhao, died in the May 30th incident. In January of this year, the May 30th Martyrs' Family Association paid compensation from the Public Works Department. Luo actually only received</p>
<h3>Two Hundred and Forty Yuan</h3>
<p>Later, he saw in the newspaper that each deceased person could receive a compensation of two thousand yuan. Luo then hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit in the Special District District Court against Hu Changsheng, Chen Fucai, Wang Daohua, and Li Changsheng, the persons in charge of the May 30th Massacre Martyrs' Family Association, and Li Zhijian, the guarantor when the compensation was fraudulently claimed, etc., for</p>
<h3>Embezzling His Compensation</h3>
<p>of one thousand seven hundred and sixty yuan, requesting investigation, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Zhitan opened the Fifth Tribunal for hearing and Prosecutor Guo Huaipu attended to perform his prosecutorial duties. The plaintiff, Luo Wenlang, testified that on December 28th of the lunar calendar last year, a person claiming to be Hu Changsheng, along with Wang Daohua and Li Changsheng, sent 240 yuan and asked me to write</p>
<h3>A Receipt for Five Hundred Yuan</h3>
<p>on a piece of paper, and Wang and Li signed it. They gave me another receipt for 260 yuan. But the Hu Changsheng at that time was not the Hu Changsheng who came to court this time. Later, I saw in the newspaper that</p>
<h3>The Amount of Compensation Was Incorrect</h3>
<p>and realized that one thousand seven hundred and sixty yuan had been embezzled. Judge Ge repeatedly asked what claims he had against the Hu Changsheng who came to court, and whether he requested that he be held criminally responsible. Luo said that he</p>
<h3>Only Wanted to Recover the Funds</h3>
<p>and did not want to convict him.</p>
<p>Of the defendants, Wang and Li were in hiding and did not appear in court. Xu also only hired a lawyer to represent him. However, the lawyers of Hu and Chen filed a counterclaim against Luo Wenlang, requesting that he be</p>
<h3>Prosecuted for False Accusation</h3>
<p>Then, the court heard the testimony of the defendant Hu Changsheng, who stated that the family association decided to distribute the compensation of two thousand yuan for each deceased person and</p>
<h3>Five Hundred Yuan for Each Injured Person</h3>
<p>On May 14th of last year, Wang Daohua and Li Changsheng came to the association as representatives of the family in this case to register. At the end of the year, the compensation was paid after</p>
<h3>Requiring a Surety to Be Found</h3>
<p>and then the association investigated and confirmed that the compensation was paid only after the facts were verified. At first, I did not know about the fraudulent claim. It was not until March that Luo Wenlang came to the association and said that the compensation he received was different from the amount reported in the newspaper. Luo then reported to the Municipal Party Headquarters to investigate Wang and Li, who were not working in the Family Association, etc. Chen Fucai also testified that he was unaware of the fraudulent claim of compensation. Finally, Prosecutor Guo expressed his opinion that</p>
<h3>The Case Was Important</h3>
<p>and the facts were not yet fully clear. The remaining people should be summoned to court to thoroughly investigate. Judge Ge then ordered that the hearing be postponed until all witnesses were detained.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Handed Over the Municipal Hall and Vegetable Market to the Municipal Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hartung Will Take Over at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the Municipal Hall and Vegetable Market on the side of Nanjing Road, after the agreement was reached on November 26 of the previous year to sell it to Hartung for 1.3 million taels, will be handed over today (the 26th). The reporter recently learned from Hartung that he has not yet decided what to do with the property he purchased. Several people have come to negotiate rentals, but no negotiations have been conducted. He intends to demolish the property in the future and rebuild it into a three-story building in the same style as the nearby alleys for opening shops and signs, etc. He also said that although the property belongs to him from today onwards, it will not be actually taken over until the end of the month due to various reasons.</p>
<h3>Those Who Seek to Extort Stall Fees in the New Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>Implicated Public Works Department Employees</p>
<p>Forty-Seven People Were Scammed</p>
<p>The Court Heard the Case Yesterday</p>
<p>The Defendant Was Released on Bail of 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The land for the small vegetable market next to the Nanjing Road Municipal Hall was sold by the Public Works Department, and a small vegetable market has been built on the corner of Zhejiang Road and Fuzhou Road. Now it has been completed, and the vendors have moved into the new vegetable market to do business. However, because of the quality of the stall location, some people have been collecting money from it. A few days ago, the Public Works Department received a report on this matter, which referred to fish vendors Li Zhaosheng and Yang Ada extorting money from other fish vendors in this incident, ranging from 20 yuan to 10 yuan. If the money is not paid, they will not have a good location. The letter also involved three employees of the Public Works Department's Health Department. The incident was investigated by Chinese and foreign detectives from the Old Gate Patrol Room as soon as it occurred. It has now been found that there are as many as 47 people who have been scammed, including fish vendor Wu Ating and others. Li and Yang were arrested a few days ago, and the details have been recorded in this newspaper. This morning, they were escorted to the Special District District Court, where Judge Sun conducted the hearing. Patrol Room lawyer Gan Jingxian stated that the defendant's behavior was prosecuted in accordance with Article 370 of the criminal law, and the defrauded people also hired lawyers Ye Fakang. The defendant hired lawyer Fan Gang. After arguing, the court ordered each defendant to be released on bail of 10,000 yuan pending trial.</p>
<h3>Trial of the Gambling Den Case on Connaught Road</h3>
<p>Seventy-Two People Accused</p>
<p>Only Twenty-Six Appear in Court</p>
<p>Strange and Bizarre Testimony</p>
<p>Enough to Make Listeners Burst into Laughter</p>
<p>A large number of gambling implements, as well as handguns, bullets, and smoking paraphernalia were seized from the roulette gambling den located at No. 230 Connaught Road, Shanghai. The Shanghai District Court Prosecutor, in addition to detaining the gambling den manager, Zhang Jinbao, also known as Wang Shoubao, allowed the remaining defendants to be released on bail. The total number of defendants in this case is 125. The result of the investigation:</p>
<h3>Prosecution Initiated</h3>
<p>Seventy-two people were prosecuted. Yesterday afternoon, the Criminal Court held a public trial. The rest were represented by lawyers. Judge Qian Chengjun and Prosecutor Liu Pingfan opened the first court session. Zhang Jinbao confessed to being 42 years old, a local, and living on Xinji Bang Road, claiming to be a</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Carpenter</h3>
<p>When the officials asked where the two handguns and numerous smoking implements that were confiscated came from, he also replied that he did not know. Subsequently, after the judge questioned He Sheng and Wu and He, the two men testified that they had been identified as the upstairs and downstairs bookkeepers at the Public Security Bureau, but in court, they only admitted to gambling and did not acknowledge being employees. However, regarding Zhang Jinbao, they stated:</p>
<h3>He is Indeed the Manager</h3>
<p>Furthermore, Wang Xiudong, Li Xinwu, Wang Shoufeng, and Wang Guiyuan, who were identified by the Public Security Bureau as those who operated the roulette, all testified in court that they were</p>
<h3>Restaurant Employees</h3>
<p>And were just there for entertainment, and finally claimed to be gamblers. All of their statements were inconsistent with the truth. The remaining group of gamblers either claimed they mistakenly entered because the sign said "Club," or that they were looking for someone. One person even claimed that he often went to the gambling den because he could</p>
<h3>Get Free Food</h3>
<p>So he often went to eat free meals, and wasn't a gambler. All of their statements were strange and bizarre, enough to make people burst into laughter. The questioning lasted until 5:00 PM, at which point Prosecutor Liu gave his opinion, stating that the case was very serious in the Public Security Bureau, but in court, according to criminal law, it is a</p>
<h3>Summary Case</h3>
<p>Very minor. According to the Criminal Procedure Law, the judge cannot refuse bail. Only Zhang Jinbao should be sentenced to imprisonment, and is therefore detained. However, all the defendants in this case were brought up late at night. Although they are evasive, it is useless. As for the two handguns and eight bullets, since no one claims them, they are naturally for</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Self-Defense</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinbao should bear criminal responsibility for this. As for the opium pipes and other items, no one admits to owning them, but it doesn't look like an opium den. Perhaps they were prepared for gamblers who</p>
<h3>Have an Opium Addiction</h3>
<p>And should also be Zhang Jinbao's responsibility. Such gambling dens are numerous in the Shanghai concessions, and there is no way to investigate them all. Since such cases are not strictly handled by the Public Security Bureau, nor can they be punished according to the concession's regulations,</p>
<h3>The Law Should Be Followed</h3>
<p>In sentencing the case. A total of 72 people were prosecuted in this case. Those who did not appear today can be judged in absentia according to Article 311 of the Criminal Procedure Law. There is also one Wang Xiaoshun, who is found to be only 11 years old, and should be declared not guilty. At this point, nine lawyers debated until 6:00 PM before it was concluded. The judge ordered the end of the debate, Zhang Jinbao was remanded in custody, and the others were released on their original bail to await sentencing.</p>
<h3>Six Robbers Sentenced to Death in Kidnapping Case of Machine Factory Owner's Child</h3>
<p>Remaining Robbers Imprisoned Separately</p>
<p>The robbers Jia Kuizhi and others, on the evening of March 25th at 9:00 PM, used weapons to break into the home of Wang Shunjin, a Ningbo native and owner of the Tongshunxing Machine Factory at No. 533, Gongping Road, and robbed valuables. They also kidnapped Wang's three-year-old son, Xia Sheng. The Hongkou Police Station cracked the case, and further investigation revealed that Jia and others had committed two other robbery cases. They were transferred to the Special District Court, which repeatedly investigated and concluded the case. Yesterday morning, the defendants were escorted to the Third Court for sentencing. Judge Feng Shide ascended the bench and briefly questioned the defendants about their ages and origins before announcing the verdict: Jia Kuizhi, Li Taozhen, Zhou Shouqing, Wang Maoyi, Zhang Yudong, and Liu Guilin were each sentenced to death. Shao Hongqing was sentenced to nine years in prison. Chi Futian was sentenced to eight years in prison. Chen Lilan was sentenced to seven years in prison. Xia Xiaosheng was sentenced to two years in prison. Two handguns and fifty bullets were confiscated. Zhang Jinfa was found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Record of the French Concession's Trial of Vicious Robbers</h3>
<p>Robbery, Kidnapping, Extortion</p>
<p>The Robbers Spared Nothing</p>
<p>Jiangbei's notorious robbers Lu Bucheng, Chen Bigao, Chen Dekuan, and Jiang Guisheng, together with Chen Xiaoliuzi, Lü Asan, Wang San, and others who are still at large, successively colluded and used weapons to rob the Beef Shop opened by Chen Zhiyi at No. 461 Caishi Road, the home of Shen Qicai at No. 955 Beile Road, the home of Qu Zhenhua at No. 787 Tong Road, the home of Wang Shengchang at No. 86 Xujiahui Road, the home of Wei Buji at No. 7 Tongchunli Road, the home of Yang Changren at No. 186 Rue du Pere Froc, and the home of Tao Boquan at No. 187 Avenue Alber, a total of seven households.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping a Child</h3>
<p>When robbing the Tao family, because they did not get much loot, they kidnapped Tao's seven-year-old son and fled. While en route, because the victim was chasing after them and shouting along the way, they threw the child by the roadside and fired three shots before escaping.</p>
<h3>Sending Extortion Letters</h3>
<p>Afterwards, the robbers wrote threatening letters and delivered them to Tao Boquan, demanding 6,000 to 7,000 yuan in foreign currency. The victim reported the matter to the police station.</p>
<h3>Robbers Captured One After Another</h3>
<p>The special investigation agency's Inspector Jin Jiulin, Chief Detective Li Yaolong, Deputy Detective Mao Jingen, Qian Yumin, Bao Detective Zhou Buguang, Zhang Ziying, and others disguised themselves as people contacting the victim and went to the agreed location, where they arrested the robbers one by one. Three handguns were confiscated. Subsequently, related individuals Liu Deyu, Shi Wenkui, Liu Guangcai, and others were brought to the police station.</p>
<h3>Victim's Statement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, they were escorted to the French Court for investigation. Judge Zhu, together with French Consul Du, presided over the criminal court for investigation. First, the Western Detective Chief reported the previous situation and presented the handguns as evidence. Then, each victim complained about the robbery.</p>
<h3>Three Robbers' Confessions</h3>
<p>When questioned, Lu Bucheng, Chen Bigao, and Chen Dekuan confessed to successively colluding with their gang to rob the plaintiffs' homes and kidnap the plaintiff Tao Boquan's child. After failing, Jiang Guisheng suggested writing threatening letters to extort money, which was true.</p>
<h3>Jiang the Robber's Suggestion</h3>
<p>Jiang Guisheng confessed that he used to be in the beef selling business. Chen Xiaoliuzi, who is still at large, invited him to a hotel to discuss the robbery. He said that Qianjiatang's leader, Tao Boquan, was quite wealthy because his relative Shi Wenkui was acquainted with the Tao family, so he knew about it. Afterwards, Chen and others went to rob them. Because they did not get much loot, they ordered him to come up with another plan, so he suggested writing threatening letters and sending them to Tao Boquan. Tao then sent Shi Wenkui to contact them, which led to the detectives designing and arresting them, which was true.</p>
<h3>Divided Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Shi Wenkui confessed that Tao Boquan entrusted him to contact the robbers, but he did not collude with the robbers beforehand and requested an investigation. Liu Deyu confessed that he used to drive a rickshaw. Wang San, who is still at large, entrusted him to put two handguns in the rickshaw and take them to the robbery location. Afterwards, he was given three yuan, which was true. Liu Guangcai confessed that although he knew Wang San, he did not know about the robbery and asked for an investigation.</p>
<h3>Lawyer's Defense</h3>
<p>Lawyer Fei Xizhen, hired by Shi Wenkui, argued that the defendant Shi Wenkui was entrusted by the plaintiff to contact the robbers and did not collude with the robbers. He requested acquittal. Lawyer Di Pike, representing the plaintiff Tao Boquan, stated that after the plaintiff received the robber's letter, Shi Wenkui came forward and volunteered to contact the robbers. This showed that he was also colluding and requested a severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Separate Sentences</h3>
<p>Chinese and French officials jointly sentenced Chen Bucheng, Chen Bigao, Chen Dekuan, and Jiang Guisheng to five years in the Western Jail, deportation, and transfer to the inland court for further investigation. Liu Deyu was sentenced to two years in the Western Jail and expulsion from the concession upon completion of his sentence. Liu Guangcai was released. Shi Wenkui's involvement will be investigated further. The confiscated handguns were confiscated.</p>
<h3>A Woman Dying for Her Husband is a Rare Occurrence</h3>
<p>The Deaths of These Two People Were Worthless</p>
<p>The Power of Passion and Love is Such</p>
<p>A Changzhou man, Zhang Tingfa, age 26, committed suicide out of fear of his wife. He had been in the rice business in his hometown and lived outside the East Gate, in front of Tianning Temple. Zhang's wife was extremely fierce, and Zhang was weak, so he was intimidated by her and obeyed her every command. A few days ago, he was abused by his fierce wife again, so he secretly came to Shanghai. He initially stayed with his aunt, Feng Zhang, and then moved to Room 30 of the Lao Ding Sheng Hotel on Fuzhou Road. The hotel was desolate, and he became increasingly depressed. He thought that living in the world like this was a disservice to his masculinity, and he could not clear his name. He decided to commit suicide rather than live under his wife's thumb. So he decided to commit suicide. He bought opium the day before yesterday and took it. After the poison took effect, the Old Gate Police Station reported the case and sent a car to the hospital. However, he died just as he arrived at the hospital entrance. The body was then taken to the Coroner's Office on Faelon Road. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Guo to the office to determine the cause of death. He learned the reason for the poisoning and ordered his aunt, Feng Zhang, to claim the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Sacrificing for a Courtesan</h3>
<p>Jiang Zhixiang had previously met a prostitute named Wang Yanmei. The two were deeply in love and lived together at No. 1123 Longmen Road. Jiang's expenses were huge because he still had a wife at home, so his monthly income was not enough to cover them. One night recently, at 12:00 AM, he took Lysol while Wang was fast asleep and committed suicide. Before his death, he wrote "My dear Yanmei, I am slitting my throat for you. I love you. I am willing to suffer all kinds of things," and other similar words. After the Old Gate Police Station learned of this, they ordered Detective Huang Fusen to send the deceased to the Coroner's Office on Faelon Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo of the Special Court came to the office to identify the body. Jiang Zhiyao, the deceased's brother, stated that his brother was married, and he did not know Wang Yanmei, but he assumed she was his brother's mistress. Wang stated that she had been selling laughter and met the deceased only a few months ago. Mr. Guo ordered that the body of the deceased, Jiang Zhixiang, be handed over to his brother, Jiang Zhiyao, after he signed a statement for burial.</p>
<h3>After the Divorce Hearing, the Child Called for Father as He Pulled on His Mother</h3>
<p>The Mother Tore Off Her Sleeve and Left</p>
<p>The Official Hoped for Reconciliation</p>
<p>Hu Anqing, a runner at the Hongchangxiang Customs Brokerage, and his wife, Hu Yu, had been married for seven years and had a son and a daughter. Their relationship was generally harmonious, but later, for some unknown reason, they had differences of opinion. The wife hired a lawyer to file a divorce petition in the District Court, and Hu Anqing also hired a lawyer to request cohabitation. Yesterday morning, Judge Tang opened the hearing. When the two parties arrived in court, Hu Youqing brought his five-year-old son, Ah Shi. Hu Yu confessed that she was 26 years old, a Ningbo native, and lived at No. 128 Wangjia Lane, Xiaonanmen. She married Hu Anqing when she was 19 years old because he gambled and made a mess of his business, so he did not support her starting last November. Her parents did not care about her life. The wooden furniture outside the couple's home was taken away by the creditor, Sun Yuankang. If Hu Anqing wants to live with her, he only needs to have a house to live in, move the furniture back, and pay her 30 yuan per month, and she will not divorce. Hu Anqing confessed that he was 26 years old, a Ningbo native, and lived at No. 128 Qingjili, Xiangyanqiao. He was a customs brokerage businessman and did not want a divorce, requesting cohabitation. He did not gamble and did not neglect his wife. Because this year his wife gave away their two-year-old daughter, and after being free, she came home late at night. He advised her that now men and women are equal. If she wants to be in charge, she should get a divorce. He also agreed to move back to his parents' home because of high expenses. On March 10, he went home with her, and on March 11, she said she was going to get clothes but never returned. On the 15th, his father went to Wangjia Lane to get his furniture, which had been taken away by Sun Yuankang, saying it was for safekeeping, because Sun was a relative of his wife and she had instructed him to do so. His monthly salary was only 30 yuan. If he rented a house outside and his wife wanted another 30 yuan, not only would he have nothing to eat, but he would not be able to pay the rent, etc. The official said that he would not hold a debate today and ordered the two parties to reconcile outside first and adjourned the court. After the adjournment, their five-year-old son hugged his mother and called for his father, which was very pitiful. The wife tore off her sleeve and left, and Hu hugged his child and returned in tears.</p>
<h3>The Doctor's Two Crimes Exposed</h3>
<p>Plotting to Harm the Second Landlord</p>
<p>Raping and Occupying a Young Girl</p>
<p>Wang Shengzhi, a resident of No. 1 Bao'an Lane, Qinglian Street, Jiomudi, within the city, was secretly poisoned by his tenant, Dr. Ye Zhicheng, last Saturday due to an argument, in an attempt to harm him. The Second District Police Station dispatched police to arrest Ye's wife, Chen, and transfer her to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. It is now known that the doctor fled for fear of punishment, and now he is also jointly charged with abduction and rape. Yesterday, the two parties worked together to arrest Ye on Bai Li Nan Road in Western Shanghai. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Abducting a Young Girl and Cohabitating</h3>
<p>Dr. Ye Zhicheng (also known as Pei Chun) is 25 years old and from Shaoxing. He has some medical knowledge. He originally practiced medicine in his hometown, but few consulted him. Last year, he fell in love with Chen Feiqing, the sister of Chen Guitang, who was also from his hometown. The girl was only 16 years old and had a weak will. Ye repeatedly seduced her and abducted her to Shanghai last July. He rented a house behind Wang Shengzhi's kitchen and lived there as husband and wife, hanging up a sign to practice medicine and make a living.</p>
<h3>Apprehension and Panic Reveals the Truth</h3>
<p>The second landlord, Wang Shengzhi, was still unhappy that Ye Zhicheng had escaped without a trace. A friend, He Mengzong, had previously interacted with Ye, so he asked He to find Ye's whereabouts. After Chen was arrested, He also went to inquire at the police station. Chen falsely claimed that since her husband had escaped and she had been arrested, if they wanted to investigate where her husband was hiding, she must know. She could ask He to help arrest him, and she would be released. She might as well tell him. Chen was in a panic and said that she had an elder brother, Chen Guitang, who ran the Lao Shun Tai Dyeing Shop in Caojiadu, Western Shanghai. Please inform him quickly to come and help. As for where Ye was hiding, it might be in the Silk Workshop on Bai Li Nan Road in Western Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Missing Younger Sister is Finally Found</h3>
<p>Chen Guitang, 26 years old and from Shaoxing, has been running the Lao Shun Tai Dyeing Shop in Caojiadu, Western Shanghai for many years. His family is all in his hometown. Last July, after learning that his younger sister, Feiqing (nicknamed Chacha), was missing, he searched everywhere in Shanghai without success. He was still asking people for information when He Mengzong came to the shop yesterday morning to report. Only then did he learn that she had been abducted and raped by Ye Zhicheng. Ye had committed a crime and was arrested, but Ye was still at large, which made him extremely angry.</p>
<h3>Wang Shengzhi Charged with Two Crimes</h3>
<p>Since Chen learned that Ye was still hiding on Bai Li Nan Road, he went to the Sixth District Police Station with He Mengzong at about 4:00 PM yesterday to report the case. The police were immediately dispatched to the Silk King's home to arrest Ye Zhicheng and bring him back to the police station. After District Chief Ren interrogated them separately, Ye Zhicheng was charged with two crimes and immediately prepared a document to send to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Agricultural and Industrial Bank Relocated to a New Building Yesterday</h3>
<p>The head office of the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank is located in Beijing, with branches in Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing. The Shanghai branch manager is Qi Zhimin, the former Chargé d'Affaires of the French Embassy. The bank was originally on Beijing Road and relocated to a new building on Jiujiang Road yesterday. People from all walks of life came to congratulate them one after another. Chairman Li Shizeng personally went to the bank to thank the guests. According to Manager Qi, the bank has been established for more than ten years and was originally named Wanping Agricultural and Industrial Bank, founded by Wang Dazhen, Wu Zhenxiu, Wu Junyong, and Lü Hanyun. Later, it expanded internally and was renamed. Last year, it was reorganized, adding Tan Danya, Qian Xinzhi, Zhou Zuomin, Li Shizeng, Feng Youwei, and others as directors in addition to the founders. Chairman Li Shizeng and General Manager Chang Yaokui have a fixed capital of 10 million yuan, with 50% already paid up. Deposits have reached more than 10 million yuan. In terms of business, the Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing branches are more developed than Tianjin and Beijing. This is because the political situation in the north is unstable and commerce is depressed. The bank's purpose is to assist the development of agriculture and industry. China is based on agriculture, and it is appropriate to first improve agriculture so that agricultural production can increase and industrial raw materials can be sufficient, and the lives of farmers and workers can be improved. However, it is difficult to talk about this when the country is in political turmoil. But the bank is determined to serve the ultimate interests of farmers and workers. The new building is a five-story cubic yellow Western-style building that is very unique. The design was designed by a French-trained engineer.</p>
<h3>Roulette Gambling Den Busted on Avenue Edward VII</h3>
<p>Zhou Fa Fined 2,500 Yuan</p>
<p>Gambling Implements and Cash Confiscated</p>
<p>French Police Inspector Li Daiyi, Western Detective Peng Shitian, Chinese Detective Chief Shen Defu, Inspector Chen Sanlin, Detective Lu Jinchen, Lu Jinbao, and others discovered that a Cantonese man named Zhou Fa had recently set up a private roulette gambling den at No. 277 Avenue Edward VII, enticing people to gamble and profiting from commissions, in violation of the prohibition. The night before last, they raided the place and confiscated a roulette wheel, a set of dominoes, more than 5,000 yuan in cash, and arrested 42 gamblers along with the owner. After questioning by the police chief, the gamblers were each fined 10 yuan and released. Zhou was released on bail. Yesterday, he was summoned to the Public Concession for investigation. First, the police chief reported the previous situation and presented the gambling implements as evidence. When questioned, Zhou admitted that he was running a private gambling den without denying. The Chinese and French officials sentenced Zhou to a fine of 2,500 yuan to be confiscated. The confiscated gambling implements and cash were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Group Insurance Should Be Handled by Domestic Companies</h3>
<p>Ministry of Railways Orders Subordinate Agencies to Comply</p>
<p>Yesterday, various agencies directly under the Ministry of Railways in Shanghai received instructions from the Ministry of Railways: "In order to implement the order, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's document Shangzi No. 9899 is approved as follows: In order to implement the order, the Hua'an Hequn Life Insurance Company submitted a report stating that the life insurance business is still in its infancy and is entirely manipulated and suppressed by foreign-funded commercial companies. The outflow of rights and interests every year is very large. It has recently been heard that government-affiliated agencies are conducting group insurance, and foreign insurance companies are seeking to solicit it. If this is successful, it will directly cause state agencies to leak money for another year and indirectly cause my country's life insurance companies to suffer a major blow. I believe that your department is in charge of the national industrial and commercial business and spares no effort to protect and promote it. When various agencies conduct group insurance, they should also advocate that it be undertaken by life insurance companies run by Chinese people. For example, our company's group insurance for employees of the Commercial Press and the Xinwen Daily has achieved remarkable results and is not inferior to foreigners. I humbly request that, as requested, when various agencies conduct group insurance, they should give priority to entrusting it to life insurance companies run by Chinese people in order to block the outflow of funds and encourage them. According to this, it is found that group insurance is also called joint insurance. It is very popular in Eastern and Western countries, and it has also been developing in my country in recent years. However, there are many insurance companies in China run by various countries. I am afraid that if this group insurance develops in the future, they will all insure with foreign companies. It is urgent to plan in advance to avoid the loss of rights and interests. The various sections stated by the company are still factual. In addition to sending them separately, they should be consulted by your department for verification and transferred to your subordinates that, in the event of conducting group insurance, they should all give priority to entrusting it to companies run by Chinese people in order to save rights and interests and promote the development of the insurance industry. It is really a public convenience. As ordered, this order is hereby transferred to you for information and compliance. If you encounter group insurance events, you should refer to the matters stated in the document and give priority to entrusting them to life insurance companies run by Chinese people. This is an important order."</p>
<h3>Extension of Business Licenses for the Tianchan and Dangui Theaters</h3>
<p>Until the End of This Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent letters to the Tianchan Theater and the Dangui First Stage Theater yesterday: "Regarding the extension of your theater's business license, the approval from the Public Works Department in the letters of May 5th and 13th has been received. Now, the board of directors has decided that the business licenses of the Tianchan Theater and the Dangui First Stage Theater will be extended until the end of this year. After this, it will be the final revocation. This approval is hereby notified to you for your information."</p>
<h3>The Case of a Traveler Losing Property at the East Asia Hotel: A Letter from Tang Tenghan</h3>
<p>Stating the Time of the Loss</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM on the 22nd</p>
<p>On May 24th, this newspaper reported that Mr. Tang Tenghan, an overseas Chinese, had lost a thousand dollars' worth of property while staying at the East Asia Hotel. Yesterday, Mr. Tang sent a letter to this newspaper from the Xiling Hotel in Hangzhou, stating the details of the loss in great detail. The letter stated, "Having read in your newspaper's local news column about my theft in Room 403 of the East Asia Hotel, there are some inconsistencies with the facts. Here are the facts briefly stated. On the evening of the 21st of this month, my wife and I came to Shanghai from Beijing and stayed in Room 403 on the fourth floor of the East Asia Hotel. On the morning of the 22nd, I went out to buy things. In the afternoon, I visited friends at the Yonghe Industrial Company. In the evening, I returned to the hotel to pack my things in preparation for a trip to Hangzhou on the morning of the 23rd. When I finished packing at about 8:00 PM, I went out with my wife for dinner. When I returned to the hotel after dinner, it was already 9:15 PM. When I left, I asked the bellboy to close the door (because the guest does not have a lock to lock the door when leaving, he must ask the bellboy to close the door). When I returned, the bellboy also opened the door, and there was nothing unusual in the room. Because I wanted to go to bed early on the 23rd, I closed the door and went to bed. At 6:00 AM on the 23rd, when I wanted to change clothes, I opened the closet and saw that the two women's cheongsams, a Western suit, and a raincoat hanging in the closet were all gone. I also saw that the small suitcase placed in the closet had been opened. When I checked my belongings, I lost a gold bracelet, diamond ring, earrings, etc. When I checked the large suitcase under the bed, there was also a small iron box missing. The box contained a small alarm clock and a pair of binoculars. Looking closely, the windows and doors were still closed and there were no changes. As for the clothes that my wife and I wore on the evening of the 22nd, the wallets in the pockets of the clothes placed on the chairs were not moved at all. Therefore, the time of the theft can be said to be between 8:00 PM and 9:15 PM on the 22nd. Furthermore, a night bellboy stated that he saw the door of Room 403 open at about 8:30 PM on the evening of the 22nd and that there was no one inside. He went inside to check the number of my luggage and then opened the closet to see that the small suitcase was still there, but the clothes in the closet were gone. He said that the number of luggage was correct, so he closed the door and left. This is another ironclad proof that the theft occurred between 8:00 PM and 9:15 PM on the evening of the 22nd. On the morning of the 23rd, after knowing about the theft, I reported it to the Old Gate Police Station and the manager in charge of the East Asia Hotel. The police station sent Chinese and Western detectives to Room 403 to carefully inspect the room. They determined that the thief entered through the door and not through the window. There is still no clue to this case. However, the East Asia Hotel is known as a place where upper-class people come and go. Now that such an unfortunate event has occurred, the people in charge of the East Asia Hotel should be able to investigate seriously and have appropriate measures. Sincerely, Tang Tenghan, Xiling, West Lake, May 25."</p>
<h3>Pan Chengfu Selling Property for a Friend</h3>
<p>Youli Deputy Comprador is Guaranteed by Pan</p>
<p>Comprador Flees and Pan is Responsible for Compensation</p>
<p>The case of Zhu Ruanxing, the deputy comprador of Youli Bank, fleeing with 150,000 taels, which was sued by the head comprador Ling Pengji to the Special District Court, has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the bank's comprador was guaranteed by Pan Chengfu. Now that the deputy comprador, Zhu Ruanxing, has fled with the money, the guarantor, Pan Chengfu, is willing to take responsibility for compensation. It is also heard that although Pan has some assets, he does not have much cash. He is now very struggling to raise this money and plans to sell the property in the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Catching and Selling Field Frogs</h3>
<p>Yuan Liang, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Public Security Bureau, issued Proclamation Fa No. 7 yesterday: "For the purpose of the proclamation, it is found that the protection of grain by field frogs is well known to women and children and is of great benefit to farmers. It is by no means superficial. Therefore, the catching, killing, selling, and buying of field frogs has been strictly prohibited in the past. However, ignorant people only know how to profit, and eaters only enjoy themselves. They regard the laws and regulations as trifling matters and disregard interests and harms. It is intended to reiterate the prohibition order to avoid repeated mistakes. Now, according to the report from the Third District, Wang Xianglin, Xu Linsheng, Zhang Zhaocai, and Yang Quanlin, who were caught by the Gang police for selling skinned field frogs, and four loads of skinned field frogs, have been brought to the court for handling. In addition to ordering the preliminary trial and strictly handling them according to law, the field frogs were confiscated and buried, and all subordinates were ordered to strictly investigate and prohibit them. It is hereby announced to the public that after this re-prohibition, there must be no more catching and selling of field frogs. If they still follow suit and deliberately violate the prohibition order, they will be severely punished once they are caught. Let each abide by it and do not violate this proclamation."</p>
<h3>Banning Summer Foods and Drinks</h3>
<p>Unclean, Uncooked Ice Water and Other Items</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Public Security Bureau issued an order to all districts and offices yesterday: "The Health Bureau's letter is approved as follows: It has recently been found that peddlers in the city often sell colored sugar water filled in glass tubes. The water filled in is mostly raw water, and the pigments contain toxic substances. Children are ignorant and buy and eat them arbitrarily, which is very dangerous. Every summer, there are many vendors in the city selling raw water, natural water-made Holland water, ice shavings, sour plum soup, cold jelly, and other foods and drinks, as well as cutting and selling watermelons, sorghum, etc. The aforementioned foods and drinks are either made of raw water and unclean ice, or are exposed on the roadside and easily contaminated, which is a medium for causing disease. In addition to issuing a notice to prohibit all sales, our bureau specially requests your bureau to instruct the district offices to instruct the patrol police to pay attention to investigating and prohibiting them in order to emphasize hygiene. Except for sending it separately, it is urgent to order you to comply and investigate and prohibit them in order to emphasize hygiene. This is an important order."</p>
<h3>Mrs. Ye Yinguan of Ningbo Files for Divorce</h3>
<p>Husband Allegedly Involved with Sister-in-Law</p>
<p>Abandoned and Neglected, Only Divorce Remains</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye Yinguan, a woman from Ningbo, filed a lawsuit in the Special District Court through her lawyer, alleging that her husband, Zhang Xuefu, had failed to provide for her. The Civil Division Chief, Ying Shi, held a hearing yesterday morning. The defendant, Zhang Xuefu, was absent, but his lawyer represented him. The plaintiff stated that since marrying the defendant, their relationship had been poor. During their cohabitation, they had few children. She accused the defendant of having a certain relationship with his sister-in-law and being inseparable from her. Last year, she filed a lawsuit in the Provisional Court seeking alimony. After the judgment, the defendant did not comply. Since November of last year, she has not received a single penny. Abandoned and neglected in this way, she only requests permission to divorce. After the lawyers from both sides debated, Judge Ying requested the Prosecutor Guo, who was present, to express his opinion. Prosecutor Guo argued for granting the plaintiff's request. The judge then declared the debate concluded and scheduled the judgment for the morning of the 29th of this month.</p>

<p>Saito Takeo, manager of the Shanghai branch of Nippon Yusen Kaisha, received an order to be transferred to the London branch. He has been preparing everything. He plans to leave Shanghai on the first of next month after Kinoshita, the incoming branch manager, arrives at the port on the 31st to hand over company affairs. He will first return to his country and then travel with his wife to the United States, France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, and Denmark before going to London to take up his post.</p>
<p>Mr. Saito is the chairman of the Shanghai Sino-Japanese Friendship Association. Members of the association held a farewell banquet in the assembly hall of the United General Association. More than forty Chinese and Japanese celebrities attended the banquet. Saito gave a speech, saying that since he came to Shanghai to work in 1904, it has been more than twenty years. Except for the periods when he was transferred to important positions in Tokyo, Yokohama, London, and Singapore, he has actually spent seventeen years in China. This time, he was transferred away from Shanghai to a distant country, which is no different from abandoning his hometown well to adapt to a foreign country. He feels especially reluctant to part with so many good friends.</p>
<h3>Japanese Director Okamoto Returns to Shanghai to Join the Board</h3>

<h3>Method of Transferring and Inspecting Housing Tax Receipts</h3>
<p>Exclusively for Registered Households</p>
<p>District Offices Should Not Misunderstand</p>
<p>Last year, because landlords often used the relocation of tenants as an excuse to evade paying the housing tax, the Finance Bureau specifically sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordering all district and precinct household registration offices to require tenants to hand over their housing tax receipts for the current quarter before allowing them to relocate. However, the precinct chiefs and police officers misunderstood that tenants in the third room also had to present housing tax receipts, which caused great inconvenience to residents. The Municipal Party Department sent a letter to the Municipal Government, ordering the Municipal Public Security Bureau to correct this. Director Yuan issued a notice to the district offices under his jurisdiction yesterday, stating that the investigation of residents reporting relocation and the inspection of current season donation certificates to prevent tax evasion was a measure formulated by the Finance Bureau last year and sent to this bureau for assistance, and was not stipulated in the household registration regulations. The payment of housing tax is borne half by the second landlord and half by the owner, and does not involve tenants in the third room. In other words, this method of investigating donation reports is only applicable to general registered households, and there is no need to inspect housing tax receipts for subordinate households reporting relocation. If each district office can follow this procedure, no difficulties will arise. In addition to reporting the case to the Municipal Government and distributing it to each district office, this order is hereby issued, ordering each district office chief to abide by it. In the future, the procedure of inspecting housing tax receipts for citizens reporting relocation shall not be applied to subordinate households to avoid disputes and prevent criticism. This order is important.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Emergency Relief: Save a Life with Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Report from the Jiji Sheng Hui</p>
<p>The Chinese Jiji Sheng Hui recently received a report from Zhang Junxian, the director of Shaanxi Relief, after a thorough investigation, that over three million people have died in the Shaanxi disaster, and over two million are left starving and awaiting death. Transporting grain is too slow to be effective. Shaanxi millet costs three yuan per dou, enough for one person to eat for one month. Wheat harvest will be available one month later, and grain will also arrive. However, the disaster victims are awaiting death now. If they wait for the grain to arrive, most of them will starve to death. The only option is to review the current funds and promote emergency relief to save a life with three yuan. The Dagong Bao and Yong Bao newspapers in Tianjin have been promoting this for several days, and donations of forty to fifty thousand yuan have already been collected. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao immediately remitted the funds to Xi'an to buy millet and distribute it. Please, this association, also find ways to initiate emergency relief to save a life with three yuan in Shaanxi, and strongly urge reputable newspapers in Shanghai to widely promote this. Considering there are over two million disaster victims, saving a life with three yuan requires six to seven million yuan to save all of them. The need for funds is so high in just one month, how can it be done? The only thing to do is to save one life at a time to do what we can. The association received the above report and, because its relief efforts in seven provinces are stretched to the limit, reaching an extreme point of difficulty, it could not help but try even harder after hearing of this tragic situation. In addition to the previous remittance of relief funds from Tianjin Feng Hou, it had no choice but to borrow 30,000 yuan from a certain bank yesterday and remit it to Shaanxi through the Shanghai Jin Li Yuan Wharf and Xie Xin Cheng Zhan Nei Zi Li Tai Hao to Zhang Junxian Qing for emergency use. This is just a drop in the bucket, how can it help? Compassionate and kind people at home and abroad, at this critical moment of life and death for the disaster victims, if you can donate three yuan at this time, you can save a life. If you miss this opportunity, the disaster victims cannot wait long in hunger, and even if you increase the relief tenfold, it will be useless. Alas, the surviving children have no tears to shed, and they call to the heavens in vain. Save people, lend a helping hand, and look to my compatriots!</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Talks on Local Products - Held by Buddha</p>
<h3>Delicacies of Zhejiang</h3>
<p>A friend, recently returned from a trip to Kuaiji (Shaoxing), having visited the Orchid Pavilion and Yu's Mausoleum, spoke of the many famous scenic spots along Mirror Lake and Mount Kuaiji. He also noted that the local customs emphasized the art of cuisine, which was quite unique. Therefore, I wielded my pen to record it.</p>
<p>The area of Yue (Zhejiang) is a water town. Most of the houses in the towns and countryside are built along rivers. Water chestnuts, lotus roots, gorgon fruits, and other products are abundant. Every day as the sun begins to set, fishermen enter the market along the river, selling fish and shrimp from their small boats, all lively and fresh. These ingredients are often used for sashimi and soups, adding a unique flavor. However, the local customs of Yue and the preferences of the people of Yue are not limited to these.</p>
<p>There is a famous dish called "Xi Eggs." Between spring and summer, they are displayed on streets, filling baskets and stacked in boxes, with many buyers. Upon inquiry, it was discovered that they are chicken eggs that have been incubated and are in the process of hatching, with the chick already formed but about to emerge from the shell. There are "whole Xi" and "half Xi" variations, with "whole Xi" being more prized and "half Xi" being secondary. The method involves baking the eggs over a low flame, without the use of a mother hen for incubation. The so-called "whole Xi" is when the chick inside the egg has its head and wings complete and is considered a delicacy. It is seasoned with five flavors, enhanced with scallions and pepper, offering a fresh, crispy, and fragrant taste. It is especially suitable to be served with fine wine, greatly enhancing the drinking pleasure. Some people even present them to relatives and friends in porcelain pots, claiming that they capture a complete, primal energy that is not exposed to wind or sun. Its nourishing properties far surpass ginseng and astragalus. If the world knows that chicken eggs are nourishing, then Xi eggs must be similarly beneficial.</p>
<p>There is also a dish called "Lamb Fetus," which is also considered very precious. Butchers in the streets and shops occasionally obtain a fully formed small lamb from the womb of a ewe. They will sell it at a good price. The method of cooking does not involve iron utensils; it must be cooked in a porcelain pot and cut with a bamboo knife to preserve its delicious flavor and nourishing properties. The nature of lamb is to benefit qi and blood, so the claim of nourishment is undoubtedly true. Its crisp and tender texture is also a given.</p>
<h3>Special Products of Qizhou</h3>
<p>Qizhou is a mountainous county in Hubei Province. Men value simplicity, and women are mostly beautiful, like the women of Luoluo Village in Yue. There are local products of the area that are considered special products of Qizhou and are praised by the world. During rainy window leisure, let's chat about two items to pass the time.</p>
<p>Qizhou has many mountains and valleys, with towering peaks blocking the sun. Ancient trees and heavy clouds gather, and miasma accumulates. Poisonous snakes lurk there. There is a snake called the "Qi Snake," which is five or six feet long, with a black body and white markings. Its scales grow densely, and it has a dragon's head, a tiger's mouth, and two horns. Those bitten by it have no cure. However, when combined with other medicines, it can cure scrofula, leprosy, and relieve paralysis. Those who catch it use iron tongs to capture it and store it in bamboo baskets. They treat it as a rare treasure and are unwilling to sell it unless they get a good price.</p>
<p>Moreover, under the high mountains, streams and rivers meander, with duckweed and fragrant herbs, and clear springs ripple. A spirit turtle is produced in these springs, commonly known as the "Green Hair Turtle." It is no larger than an inch, with a jade-like back shell, resembling ivory carvings. Green hair grows on it, as tender and green as moss. It is said that this turtle can prevent fire disasters, treat throat diseases, and ward off fire. Although preventing fire may not be entirely true, treating throat diseases often yields miraculous results. The people of Qi treasure it.</p>
<h3>After Reading the Unevenness of the National Language Speech Contest of the Four Universities - Rambling Thoughts</h3>
<p>In a piece published in this newspaper on the 19th of this month, titled "National Language Speech Contest of the Four Universities," signed "39," the last section, titled "Beauty Trap Fails," stated that a certain university used a beauty trap to win the championship in the National Language Speech Contest last year, and unfortunately, the same trick failed this year. After reading it, I not only found it laughable but also felt resentful towards the bankruptcy of Chinese education. Otherwise, how could someone who has received higher education (the author of this article must be a respectable university student) have such a simple mind?</p>
<p>Now, to save space and time, I will list a few points to correct the author's mistakes:</p>
<p>(1) Since the four universities have both male and female students, why can't female students participate in the competition? Does the competition regulation stipulate that only male students are allowed to participate?</p>
<p>(2) Should the championship be monopolized by male students? If female students win, it's a beauty trap; what is it if male students win? I would like to ask the author.</p>
<p>(3) The phrase "beauty trap" can certainly be used as a tool to insult a woman's personality. However, based on the first point, the author is simply exposing the corruption and immorality of his own thinking. Although he is a figure of the 20th century, these remarks are truly those of an unyielding and unadaptable 18th-century man. Alas, education and personality are simply bankrupt. The newspaper on the 22nd reported that a female student from a certain school won first place in the English competition of the four universities on the 21st. The beauty trap has appeared for the third time, and there may be more in the future. Please, this confused author, broaden your mind. Today's women are definitely not the women of seven or eight years ago who would be scared off by a joke. Perhaps the worse the environment, the more courage they will have to fight.</p>
<h3>Silkworm Talk - Jing Mengdie</h3>
<p>The silkworm is a tiny insect, yet silk production is a major source of profit, upon which people's livelihood and the national economy depend. As summer begins and new cocoons enter the market, a lonely person in a traveler's window creates "Silkworm Talk." Although this creature is small, it can be used to symbolize bigger things.</p>
<p>The silkworm is a wise insect, but also a foolish one. A little bit of cleverness is innate. Myriad silken threads are entwined to the death. I once composed three quatrains, loving its wisdom and pitying its foolishness.</p>
<p>The poem says: "Full of wisdom, it spits out writing, with intelligence comparable to a wise maiden. Exhausting talent to create beautiful brocade, it weaves a wedding dress for others. Myriad threads form a cocoon, an exquisite scheme, an utterly foolish plan. The roots of affection are never severed until death, and in the next life, it transforms into a moth. The ending is as unfair as yours, and it goes into boiling water and fire. The same fate as the bow and the dog throughout the ages, the great general is cooked after success."</p>
<p>"After gathering hundreds of flowers to make honey, for whom do they toil, for whom do they sweeten?" This is a poem by an ancient person about bees. The silkworm's spinning silk and the bee's making honey are the same; when cleverness is exhausted, it becomes great foolishness. Human worries all come from wisdom, so Lao Tzu has the saying, "Great skill appears clumsy, and great wisdom appears foolish." It is a famous saying that awakens the world.</p>
<p>Sometimes, silkworms form cocoons together in the same chamber, because they love each other and remain inseparable until death, like flowers blooming side by side and trees growing intertwined branches. However, silk merchants do not take them. Is it because their love is concentrated and they do not know their limits?</p>
<p>I recall that years ago, my friend Deng Duntie (also known as Fenweng) sent me a poem expressing his concern, saying, "My talent is praised by the party as Jingzi, and my literary talent is always outstanding. In the moonlit night with sandalwood clappers and golden cups, the silken threads entangle me in bitter groans." The last seven characters are clearly used to describe me as a silkworm trapped in its own cocoon. My talent is ridiculed as being like a wooden goose, and my skills are misused like carving worms. My heart's blood dries up, and my temples turn gray early, merely because I am so attached to my habits that I exhaust my youth. My good friend loves me and implies a subtle regret in his words.</p>
<h3>Dragon Silkworm - Ji Qin</h3>
<p>The largest of silkworms is called the Dragon Silkworm. It is about seven or eight inches long, slightly black, with horns on its head and scales all over its body. The amount of leaves it eats is very different from ordinary silkworms. The villagers specially set aside a room to feed it. When it makes its cocoon, it does not need to be put on a frame or kept warm. Each cocoon is as large as a goose egg, thick in texture and white in color. Each cocoon can yield a handful of silk. However, the species is not passed on, as it is said to be the incarnation of the Silkworm God. Those who obtain it treat it as a treasure.</p>
<p>The Li family in my hometown of Huxi has been raising silkworms for a hundred years and has obtained Dragon Silkworms twice. The news spread far and wide, and everyone knows about it. People still enjoy talking about it to this day. According to the "Supplement to Records," "There are Ice Silkworms on Yuanjiao Mountain. They are seven inches long, black, with horns and scales. They are covered with frost and snow before making a cocoon that is one foot long and has five colors. The brocade woven from it does not get wet in water and does not burn in fire. In the time of Emperor Yao of Tang, a seaman offered it to Yao, who used it to make royal garments." I believe that this so-called Dragon Silkworm is probably similar to the Ice Silkworm and is nothing strange. Ignorant villagers often use superstitious sayings to fabricate and embellish it. It is indeed too much. I record it for verification.</p>
<h3>A Little Common Sense - Yang Gao</h3>
<p>When stamps stick together, do not tear them apart with a knife. Simply immerse them in water for a moment, and the glue will dissolve and separate them.</p>
<p>When the coal fire is about to go out, quickly place a small spoonful of salt on it, and it will reignite.</p>
<p>For all colors of leather shoes except black, any oil stains or dirt can be removed by rubbing them with banana peel.</p>
<p>In case of a fire, if reporting by telephone, in the Public Concession, call 10150. For the French Concession West District, call 30079. For the Central District, call 10079.</p>
<p>Smokers often feel that the yellowing of their fingers is unsightly. Soak cuttlebone in water and rub it on the fingers, and the yellowing will disappear quickly.</p>
<p>When purchasing a watch, you should open the mainspring yourself to see how the hairspring moves and how it moves slowly. If it moves as before without speeding up or slowing down after being fully wound, then there will be no stopping problem.</p>
<p>When you hear gunfire on the road, remain calm and do not panic. Stand next to a telephone pole to avoid stray bullets. A headache can be relieved by sniffing a little fine salt into the nostrils. When a streetcar is about to stop, you should lean backward, hold the copper bar tightly with your right hand, step down with your left foot first, and then let go to avoid falling.</p>

<h3>Warmth in the Heart ( ) 201</h3>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Emerald Garland and Pearl Pin, Beauty Returns, Talented Scholar's Green Chamber and Red Canopy, Famous Courtesan Marries into a Prominent Family</p>
<p>Liu Xingzhu laughed and said, "Needless to say, she naturally adheres to the precepts of the boudoir, but it mostly comes from her own will. Buying smiles with gold was originally a matter of melancholy and boredom, like a person who lacks feminine warmth and is overly dry. Now, that's no longer necessary. However, I do miss Zuo Shichen often calling for Ruiyun. He says she is a lively and lovely little girl, a delicate and pitiful girl. Have you been calling for her lately?"</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen said, "I recently received news that Ruiyun will be marrying after this holiday."</p>
<p>Liu Xingzhu said, "Ah, is this news certain? This is a thunderbolt out of the blue for you!"</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen said, "There's nothing surprising. Who in the courtesan houses doesn't get married?"</p>
<p>Liu Xingzhu said, "I think your words are deliberately pretending to be calm, a kind of insincere statement. So, would you say this news is bad news or good news?"</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen said, "As you said just now, when a person is melancholy and bored, it's like needing feminine warmth. But even among women, there must be an opportunity and a match. It's hard to meet someone with a bit of opportunity and a bit of a match, like something you love being snatched away out of thin air. One can't help but feel a little annoyed. So, of course, it's bad news. However, if you think about it the other way, what's the fun in their lives in those fire pits? Courtesans have no autonomy of their own. Unless you have the power to rescue them from the dust, there's no need to talk about it. If you don't have the power and hate that others have the power to rescue them, do you want them to spend their whole lives in the brothels? Since you have a bit of love for them, you shouldn't think like that. In this way, I think it's good news."</p>
<p>Liu Xingzhu laughed and said, "Ah, this is your philosophy of frequenting courtesan houses, or rather, the moral code of frequenting courtesan houses. But I want to ask you, where did you get this news? When famous courtesans get married, it's always kept as secret as possible, especially from their regular customers. First, they're afraid of breaking or leaking the news. When people take concubines, they often hide it from their families, and it won't succeed if they quarrel. Second, they're afraid that they won't be able to collect enough contributions during the holidays. They're doing this for the future of the girl, and there's endless hope. Now that they know she's going to get married, the hope for the future is gone. The dissolute customers will just visit once and be done with it, so the courtesan house will suffer a great loss. Therefore, they always keep the news of marriage a secret. Ding Yang (a reliable person) has also accepted you. Ask them, and they will still deny it. Is your news really not confirmed?"</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen said, "It's very certain. Although my friends told me first, it was gradually confirmed later. In the end, even she herself told me. Is it still not certain?"</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Guangdong Merchants Engage in Emptying Tactics, Resulting in Numerous Short Squeezes</p>
<p>Three Grades of Spun Yarn Rebound, Drastically Changing Sentiment</p>
<p>The trend in the yarn market remains robust. After being heavily acquired by Guangdong merchants, the majority of participants are experiencing heightened excitement. New sellers are rare, and many small-scale investors are covering their short positions in response to improving market conditions. Eastern Three-Grade Yarn has experienced a significant decline in recent days, leading yarn factories to consider reducing working hours and limiting production to stabilize the market. Consequently, prices have rebounded by three to four yuan, causing a sudden shift in market sentiment and increased buying pressure. However, actual sales remain lackluster, with development limited to Guangdong merchants, while other groups show no progress. This situation makes it difficult for the yarn market to decline. Buyers are adopting an increasingly assertive stance, demonstrating a stronger determination to acquire goods than before. If sales continue, there may be expectations for higher prices in the market.</p>
<p>Futures Yarn Continues to Rise; Floor Traders Speculate</p>
<p>The market opened with a flat sentiment in the morning, as U.S. cotton prices declined again, reducing buying enthusiasm. Prices fell by two to three qian. Subsequently, news of production cuts in Eastern Three-Grade Yarn led to a rebound of over three yuan, tightening the market and causing prices to rise by three to four qian. As a result, prices for all months increased by one to three qian. In the afternoon, market sentiment remained bullish with strong buying interest, especially in the second session. However, some profit-taking occurred towards the close, causing a slight dip. Overall, prices still increased by one, two, or three qian. Total trading volume for the day reached 13,300 bales. The closing prices are recorded below, along with gains, losses, and outstanding accounts.</p>
<p>May 153.8 Increased by 4 21,700</p>
<p>August 155.2 Increased by 3 23,800</p>
<p>June 154.5 22,925</p>
<p>September 155.9 11,485</p>
<p>July 154.7 12,480</p>
<p>October 156.0 1,050</p>
<p>Spot Sales Decrease</p>
<p>Daily sales of spot yarn across various groups totaled 1,305 bales, with 550 bales taken in by fellow traders. Market conditions remained stable. Guangdong merchants accounted for the largest share of purchases from out-of-town groups, with 520 bales. In addition, Sichuan merchants purchased 100 bales, Tianjin 55 bales, Andong 40 bales, Xuzhou 45 bales, inland merchants 200 bales, Shantou 160 bales, Changsha 150 bales, and other miscellaneous groups 35 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Increasingly Stable</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very strong and the situation is sharp, but the US cotton situation is weakening. However, because the local market is being tightened by the Han group's long positions, the decline in foreign cotton has little effect for the time being. There is a huge amount of speculation in the distant months, and the market is tight due to a lack of sellers. Moreover, there are expectations that the actual sales of yarn may develop, and the buyer's mood is becoming more and more determined. However, some of the Han group is taking profits.</p>
<p>Speculative Shorts by Retail Investors, Exchange, Han Standard</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the Exchange Han Standard, the market fell by one qian following the decline of foreign cotton. In the second and third sessions, the market rebounded due to speculative shorts by retail investors, and was then boosted by the yarn market, with each month rising by five fen to one qian. In the afternoon, market sentiment remained high, but the Han group sold several thousand loads, resulting in each month rising again by five fen. Total trading volume for the day was 27,900 loads. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>
<p>Han Standard Closing Prices, Gains, Losses, and Account Balances</p>
<p>73.580 Increased by 1 63,100</p>
<p>53.490 Increased by 1 48,200</p>
<p>83.585 55,660</p>
<p>63.550 70,900</p>
<p>93.520 29,200</p>
<p>Actual Demand Relatively Active</p>
<p>The spot cotton market is very strong, and factory demand may become active, so the market is tightening. Sources include 100 bales of Yao Flower and 230 bales of Tong Flower. Sales records are as follows:</p>
<p>Shaanxi Flower 36.10, Yong'an Factory entered 500 pieces for delivery to the factory</p>
<p>Again 37.00, Another 500 pieces Again</p>
<p>American Variety Flower 45.75, Another 200 pieces Again</p>

<h3>British Indian Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>Bombay's business last week was very slow due to political relations, and the Far East had no need for it due to the sharp drop in Japanese yarn prices. China was also inactive. European manufacturers had slight transactions, and Indian manufacturers continued to purchase various standard cotton due to the smooth sales of gray cloth. The statistical appendix for the last week is as follows (unit: thousand packages):</p>
<p>Previous Week Last Week</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts since September 1 3,067 3,12</p>
<p>Current inventory at the end of the week 1,275 1,273</p>
<p>Cumulative exports since September 1 1,937 1,974</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe 650 659</p>
<p>Shipped to China 319 220</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan 921 947</p>
<p>Other regions 47 48</p>
<p>Liverpool's spot demand has not improved this past week. Professional demand for futures is stalled, and speculators are waiting and watching. Price fluctuations are entirely dependent on the weather reports from the American cotton-producing regions. The market situation was very bleak at the end of the week, and the demand for Egyptian cotton remains poor.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Starts Firm, Ends Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply from various groups in Zhabei was scarce, and sales on the street were sluggish. In the early morning, the Changjiang group showed a tendency to inquire in the market, but because it was refreshing, a small number of cargo customers sold, causing the appetite of customers to weaken. The high-quality Northern Japonica managed to remain stable, while the medium-quality continued to decline. Therefore, the price of Japonica rice fluctuated slightly throughout the day. The digestion of light Indica rice was still sluggish, and the buying interest was not refreshing. The high-set quotation was followed by weakness. Yangjian rice sales were stagnant and not prosperous. Transactions above 18 yuan were rare, and variable yuan slightly shifted the steady trend. The sales floor seemed slightly active, but the incoming goods were still connected and prices were difficult to prosper. High-quality goods on the market were still quoted at around 18.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Around the 10th, ships from various groups in the South Shanghai River arrived, and market sales were still not smooth. Changbang polished Japonica rice sales are still active, but only transactions of crushed rice. The sales of machine-polished Japonica rice from the Jiangsu and Tongbang groups are sluggish, and the market is particularly dull. The price is flat and weak. It is feared that it will not be easy for the daily Japonica rice market to pass small and large trends, and the situation may become a long-term stalemate. Nanbang light early-season rice arrives and is sold vigorously. Customer groups need particularly high-quality goods to slightly enter the market, and the market situation is quite poor. There are still some who have short steps in the quotation. Both Yangdu and Jian arrive and are sold sparsely. The prosperity and disgrace of the city will all change. Variable yuan river inventories are seen as thick, and the appetites of the two are watching, intending to gradually decrease, but the cargo households are unwilling to repair the market. Therefore, the transaction is clear and weak, and the path is smooth, and the price is unchanged. High-quality goods continue to be quoted at 17.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Vermicelli Market in a Sideways Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the vermicelli market opened in the morning and afternoon, and the market for each month was generally sideways. In the early morning, due to the heavy rain seen again last night, although the human heart was once firm, it was slightly soft again when it was clear again. Looking at the situation in the future, the 60 qian mark for this month can be safely passed. The situation of each month in the long-term is currently subject to the weather, although the rain is still not hindering the wheat harvest, but the human heart will inevitably be driven by the weather. The seedlings in each place are very good in the land of Shanghai, Ningbo, and Jiangbei, which is better than in previous years. What is hoped for is the gate of harvest. As a result, there was no up or down in May and June, 2.5 li per penny in July, no up or down in August, and 7.5 li per penny in September and October.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Nears Stability and Fars Fatigue</h3>
<p>New Wheat Harvest Seems Good, Immortal Earth Short Positions Close</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of wheat in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a trend of stability in the near term and fatigue in the far term. Although June is the season for new wheat, the first half of the month is still the old goods stall. The future spot wheat will naturally be quoted higher than the standard. Therefore, the hearts of the standard sparrows have not changed. As for July, it is entirely new wheat. Although it rained heavily last night, it has cleared up yesterday, and people inside and outside the industry believe that the wheat seedlings everywhere are better than in previous years. Therefore, the long positions of the inland gang have gradually closed, and the market has also shown signs of fatigue. As a result, the closing price of June was 1 fen higher than the previous week, 1 fen less in July, and 2 fen less in August to October. The spot wheat market is still trending towards stability, as the arrival and sales are both quiet and the new goods are about to be connected, so it is in a state of stagnation. Qingjiangpu wheat, Nansuzhou wheat, and Bengbu wheat were opened at 5 taels, 1 qian, and 5 fen, totaling 2,000 packages, which were handled by Fuxin and Fufeng.</p>
<h3>Yellow Soybean Spot Sales Smooth</h3>
<p>About 10,000 Packages of All Kinds of Truck Wheels Sold</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot soybean market was stable. There were not many goods arriving from the north road, but the western road, the source of the Yangtze River, was extremely well connected. Due to the relatively high price of the Linlian soybeans, the customer group was not greatly interested. Due to the relatively cheap price of the Han-Xun soybeans, they were still able to be shipped, so the intention to enter was more enthusiastic. The prices of each stall did not increase or decrease, but the transaction was extremely prosperous. It is estimated that 2,000 packages of Dalian Yuan soybeans, 500 packages of Shahe Jinyuan, and 3,500 packages of Hankou late soybeans, 3,000 packages of Chehuang, 500 packages of foreign flower soybeans, and 250 packages of Jiujiang late soybeans were opened. 500 packages of winter soybeans and more were priced at 5 taels, 1 qian, and 8 fen to 5 taels in total. More than 10,000 packages were sold throughout the day, and both the local Chefang and customer groups have all taken action. The futures market has no glory or disgrace, and the entry and exit is very rare. The opening price for this month was 5 taels, 4 qian, and 6 fen, which was slightly better than the previous weekend by 1 fen.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea American Merchant Continued to Run Shanghai Factory</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in this port continued to trend strongly and smoothly. It was found that American merchants were very enthusiastic about Shanghai White Factory operations. The American exchange rate rose secretly, and American sales continued to be smooth. Blue Lebig and others entered 120 packages of Shanghai White Factory operations (new and old combined in June), and the price became more and more firm.</p>
<h3>Changzhou New Cocoon Continues to Rise Due to Rain</h3>
<p>Harvest Only Reaches Four Parts, Cocoon Prices Expected to Rise by Five Yuan</p>
<p>This year's silkworm season in the various cities and villages of Changzhou is not good. The harvest of new cocoons is better in the eastern villages. The total extraction is only 40%. The cocoon shops in the northwest villages have been open for four days, while the eastern villages have only been open for three days. The goods arriving on the market are scarce, and the price of the local variety of cocoons was only 50 yuan at the initial opening (northwest villages). It has since risen to 53 to 54 yuan. The price of foreign variety cocoons is 60 to 65 yuan. The initial opening of the local variety in the eastern villages was 53 to 54 yuan, and it has since risen to 56 yuan. The price of foreign variety cocoons is 65 to 68 yuan. The continuous rain in the past two days has caused the price of foreign cocoon merchants to rise by 5 yuan. Henglin opened at 72 yuan yesterday afternoon. Only 48 cocoon shops are open in the whole county.</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea Transactions Are Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in this port saw strong purchases of Qimen high-quality black tea from British merchants, Ewo, Jardine Matheson, Kamlung, Tinyu, and other firms. Total transactions throughout the city exceeded 2,800 boxes, with top-tier prices reaching 230 taels. The market was quite firm. However, sales of goods with poor leaf bottoms were difficult to see as smooth. The opening price of He Kou black tea was 55 taels, which was lower than last year by 4 to 5 taels. The green tea market remained sluggish. The goods from Tunxi, Shexian, and Suian had not yet opened yesterday. Only two firms, Tongfu and Baochang, and Baitou Zhuang had a slight appetite for the Wenzhou varieties of green tea. The rest are all watching.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University to Establish College of Science</h3>
<p>Jiaotong University in this port has more than 30 years of achievement, and the graduates of the school are employed by the Ministry of Railways, with no idlers. Therefore, students from far and near come to study. Currently, the Shanghai headquarters of the school has the College of Transportation Management and the three engineering colleges of Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. The Tangshan branch has a Civil Engineering branch, and the Beiping branch has a Transportation Management branch. The total number of students reaches more than 1,000. However, according to the Ministry of Education's regulations for a complete university, the school is now nominally established as four engineering schools and two management colleges, but in fact, it only has engineering and management colleges. The Ministry of Railways has noted that there is still a lack of talent for materials and chemical testing on various roads under the Ministry, so the Ministry of Railways is eager to establish a College of Science to cultivate talent and store it for the country. After receiving the order, the school held repeated meetings and decided to start running the college next semester, using the current South Campus (the site borrowed by the private Nanyang Model Primary and Secondary School) as the college site. The college plans to temporarily divide into departments such as Chemistry and Physics. The number of students is planned to be absolutely limited. Because there are few people in need of this talent in various agencies of the Ministry of Railways other than the Railway Bureau, it is necessary to limit it in order to ensure the graduates have a way out. After the establishment of the college, the school's recurring expenses will be greatly increased in order to fully equip and have excellent teachers to cultivate true talent. As for the position of dean, some say that it will be held by Dr. Xu Mingcai, the current head of the Department of Chemistry at the school, or Master Qiu Weiyu, the head of the Department of Physics, while others say that it will be filled by a relevant figure sent by the Ministry of Railways. There is much discussion, and it is not known who is who. In short, the issue of the dean has not yet been revealed. (Huahua)</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University's Enrollment Plan for This Year</h3>
<p>Jiaotong University enrolls freshmen into the first year of undergraduate studies and the first year of preparatory studies in each session, with a total of more than 100 students. Since the Ministry of Education issued an order to abolish preparatory studies at universities, Jiaotong University intends not to enroll new preparatory students this year in order to implement the Ministry of Education's order. Only 125 new students will be enrolled in the first year of undergraduate studies. The enrollment plan for this year is listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Although preparatory studies will not be enrolled, graduates of the Nanyang Model Primary and Secondary School will still be allowed to advance to the first year of preparatory studies in accordance with the contract, limited to 30 students. Therefore, there will only be one class of preparatory students in the next semester.</p>
<p>(2) The enrollment address in previous sessions was limited to Shanghai, so that students who were eager to study from afar would travel long distances to apply. Those who were economically disadvantaged and eager to study might not be able to fulfill their wishes due to the high cost of travel. In order to eliminate this disadvantage and select true talent from various places, this year, enrollment will be divided into six locations: (1) Shanghai, (2) Beiping, (3) Wuchang or Hankou, (4) Guangzhou, (5) Tianjin, (6) Tangshan. However, Tianjin and Tangshan have not been fully determined, as the two locations are quite close to Beiping.</p>
<p>(3) An enrollment committee will be organized, with the deans and directors of the various colleges at the Shanghai headquarters, the deans of the Beiping and Tangshan branches, the president and vice president, the director of student affairs, the director of general affairs, and Secretary Hu as members, with a total of 15 members. The allocation method is that Shanghai will retain five enrollment committee members to handle enrollment matters. The remaining locations will have either two or three members each. The chairman of the enrollment committee in each location will be appointed by the president.</p>
<p>(4) The registration deadline and examination date in each location will be the same to avoid malpractice. As for the examination level, in addition to physics, chemistry, and mathematics for engineering materials, economics, bookkeeping, and management will also be added to the management department, and mathematics and physics will be tested in the same way as engineering courses. The mathematics will be shallower, but history and geography will be added to the examination compared to engineering courses.</p>
<p>The above is a general description. As for the detailed situation and the past examination questions, the Anhui Fellow Association of the school published the Jiaotong University Application Guide, and the Cooperative Society published the Application Jinliang, which will explain various situations in detail. (Huahua)</p>
<h3>Youth Corner Manuscript Guidelines</h3>
<p>(1) The text should be related to youth issues, including discussions, news about domestic and foreign schools or students, essays, and descriptions of school life. The style is not limited.</p>
<p>(2) The paintings should be limited to those related to youth issues.</p>
<p>(3) Photos of youth life (such as sports, travel, excursions, theater, lectures, gatherings, exhibitions, various competitions, etc.), school news, and photography of youth movements are acceptable. Both individuals and groups are welcome.</p>

<h3>Bird of Paradise</h3>
<p>The bird of paradise is a specialty of the cannibal island of Papua in the South Seas, and is also a world-renowned precious bird. The bird of paradise and the (spices) of the Moluccas were the most powerful things that lured Europeans to sail east. In the sixteenth century, after the Portuguese discovered the (spices) of the Moluccas, the Spanish and Dutch followed suit and sailed east, all vying for spices in the Moluccas. Therefore, the Moluccas are still called the (Spice Islands). The bird of paradise became known to Europeans during Magellan's eastward voyage in 1521. Since then, every ship that came to collect spices had to bring a few birds of paradise back to Europe as a noble tribute and also as a precious commodity, worth hundreds of gold coins at the time.</p>
<p>Now, the Singapore Museum displays more than forty kinds of birds of paradise. Their shape is not very large, the largest being about the size of a magpie. Their feathers are beautiful and as colorful as amber and coral. The tips of their feathers are like long, sharp needles that can be spread open like a peacock's tail. The two wings are densely covered with soft, pure white hairs, which are the most valuable. Europeans mostly use them to decorate hats. Birds of paradise like to chase the wind and dance in the air, so the natives call them the divine bird (Bolan dinata), believing that they descended from the heavenly kingdom of paradise to earth.</p>
<p>Every time it is mating season for the birds of paradise, dozens of male birds surround the female bird and fly in the treetops, each spreading open their gorgeous wings to dazzle the female bird and ask for her favor. The natives often take advantage of this period, hiding under the trees and shooting them with carefully blown darts that do not stain the feathers with bird blood. The male birds, eager to woo the female birds, often do not pay attention to the natives' schemes, so the natives often calmly shoot all the male birds one by one. As a result, the number of male birds on Papua Island has greatly decreased, and the females are left wailing.</p>
<p>Most of those who trade in birds of paradise are overseas Chinese. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, some overseas Chinese had already drifted to the cannibal island of Papua. Now, those who trade in birds of paradise on the island are all passed down through generations. However, the overseas Chinese do not directly enter the mountains to hunt because most of Papua Island is still unexplored virgin forest, and the natives still live a barbaric and primitive life. Moreover, cannibalism is rampant, and miasmic air, poisonous snakes, and ferocious beasts are everywhere. Although the overseas Chinese are brave enough to take risks, they do not dare to go deep into the interior, but only trade with the semi-civilized natives on the coastal areas. The semi-civilized scholars exchange the birds of paradise they get for gold and silver jewelry, floral cloth, salt, and works of art that the scholars like. Mr. Tang Yueshi, an artist, passed away, and four years have passed. Now, his wife, Ms. He Yizhao, has purchased a grave site in the Chinese Cemetery in Wujia Lane. All burial procedures have been completed, and the burial took place on May 15th. The image above is the posthumous portrait of Mr. Tang.</p>
<p>Knives, etc. The overseas Chinese then resell the birds to Europeans. Recently, the lowest price for each bird is worth fifty to sixty shields, and about eight thousand birds are exported each year, worth four hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<p>This month, on the 24th, Mr. Shen Liang, the owner of the Jingjing Optical Company on Jing'an Temple Road, and Ms. Zhaoqi, the daughter of Mr. Hu Fangyong, a Shanghai businessman, held their wedding ceremony in the auditorium of the New Hotel on Jiujiang Road. All the guests were famous figures gathered together. Mr. Shen is young and handsome, with both talent and learning, and has considerable experience in the study of ophthalmology. Ms. Hu is beautiful and virtuous, and is also good at writing. The image below is their newlywed portrait. (Yuzhai)</p>
<p>Apart from the natives, probably few people in the world have seen live birds of paradise, and very few have been captured alive, so they are not easy to raise. Explorers in the primitive jungles of Papua often hear strange bird calls, which are the calls of birds of paradise. However, most people always think that the singing of such a beautiful bird must be very pleasant, so no one pays attention to it.</p>
<p>After the natives capture the bird of paradise, they cut off its feet. Therefore, almost all the birds of paradise seen now have no feet. The natives also do not tell people the origin of the bird of paradise. If asked, they lie and say (birds of paradise often fly high in the air and never descend until they are exhausted, but when they are exhausted, they use the slender, sharp needles at the ends of their feathers to hang on the treetops to rest, so they have no feet and do not know that there is land from birth, but live by absorbing heavenly dew, so they are called birds of paradise).</p>
<p>Malays and overseas Chinese also call birds of paradise (dead birds). It is said that when the bird soars high in the sky, a fragrant smell descends from the sky, and if someone strikes it, it will die immediately. Therefore, Malays and overseas Chinese still do not dare to catch birds of paradise. In fact, the feathers of male birds aged four years are the most beautiful and valuable when they are caught during the mating season from May to September. (Mao Yuewen)</p>
