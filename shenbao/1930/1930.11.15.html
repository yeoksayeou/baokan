<p>時評</p>
<h3>濱口首相被刺</h3>
<p>日本内閣首相之被刺。前有政。友會總裁之原敬今有民政·黨總裁之濱口原。敬以一新聞記者。出任首相。當時稱第一任平民内閣。然其施政。則以專斷手段。壓迫民衆。藐視輿論。頗爲多數日人所難。卒於大正十年十一月四日。被一少年名中岡艮一者暗殺於東京驛。日本國民對之甚冷淡。蓋因表同情於原内閣少也。今濱口内閣被刺。有無生命憂。尙未可測。而其被刺原因。亦未判明。惟吾人觀於日本政局之多故。則深爲濱口不幸。旣因倫敦海約統帥權問題。引起海軍界之齟齬。又因世界經濟墮落之潮流。而其唯一主張之實施緊縮與金解禁兩政策。益爲政爭之反對派所藉口。其實緊縮政策。雖足以引起下層社會失業之增加。但値田中内閣積極政策引起財界不安之後。引種消極辦法。實亦適合於一般民衆之心理。金解禁本爲民政政友兩黨共揭之政策。田中任内。已有布置。濱口加以縝密籌備而實行之。在當時亦並未發生若何不幸之風潮。第爲經濟潮流所迫。社會上發生。種種不良影響。遂盡舉以歸罪於此二者。而責難濱口者益多。實則平心論之。此種不良影響。旣非一端所能造成。亦非一手所能挽救。今據兇手佐鄉屋留雄供稱。爲謀恢復不景氣之故使其謀刺眞相。果眞如是。則誠爲濱口不幸矣。此事關係於日政局前途甚大。將來發生若何變動非可逆料使濱口之傷而果能轉危爲安者。則誠爲日人之幸也</p>

<p>▲贖價遞减匪見顏固無力贖身、而旅館中藏匿已五日、所費亦不貲、又恐事洩、乃由三百元之贖價、降至二百元而一百元、但顏仍不能允、至是匪等雖憤怒塡膺、自認晦氣、猶不願安然輕放、遂詢顏滬地有何親戚、顏答表親陳家和、傅照連、或能代予設法、</p>

<h3>公共租界取締賽狗之原因</h3>

<h3>讀書運動之後兩日</h3>
<p>— 妍千</p>
<p>讀書運動之第一日。已有胡先生與讀書運動一文載在本談。茲再將後兩日演講者陳鐘凡王雲五二先生之演詞大要。示讀者。俾窺全豹。</p>
<p>▲倒轉來延長一點　照靑年會預定程序。第二日之演講者應爲王雲五。但因王先生在首都參加工商會議。被推爲宣言起草員。不及趕回。迺臨時請陳鐘凡先生將演講提前一日。迨次日三時。作者赴會。見大門首一臨時布告。謂王先生演講須展至六時。向事務處問其原因。謂王先生由京抵滬。大約須在三點後。或竟五點後。六點鐘。王先生果至。謂一下車。即被會中人拉來。雖曾一入家門。然僅費三十秒鐘。夜飯亦未入肚。蓋王先生知一堂坐待之千餘靑年。固在枵腹候敎也。講者與聽者並皆餓肚從事。亦學界之美談已。</p>
<p>▲陳先生讀什麽書　陳鐘凡先生之講題爲「讀什麽書。」將本國所有汗牛充棟之書籍。分歷史的。哲學的。文藝的之大類。源源本本。暢述無遺。其中獨到之處甚多。如哲學的一類。有王夫之曾提倡民族主義。王宗義曾提倡民權主義。顧炎武曾提倡民生主義之說。又謂本國向無種種專史。如敎育史。藝術史之類。所以初欲研究專門學問之人。往往有無從下手之嘆。然所有載籍。含專史材料極多。如能按類尋去。兩三月功夫。便可得極好專史材料矣。先生且諄諄謂人。讀書須將基本科學基礎打好。尤於研究學術必須有數學幾何學等等根抵三致意焉。先生講時。面現笑容。藹然學者氣象。已足使後生感動。聽衆中有圓面微髭者。倚立台旁。類頻旋轉其頭。爲折服之有力表示。亦足見先生演講動人之深已。</p>
<p>▲王先生怎樣書　王先生講怎樣讀書。先述讀書三動機。曰被强迫的。爲應用的。有興趣的。並謂有興趣的讀書之成功爲最大。次述讀書之樂。謂讀書實爲與著書者唔談。非但遠在歐美各國之大學問家可與相對一室。即若干年代前之古聖賢人亦可相見於案頭。其樂蓋靡有窮盡。又謂讀書有兩難關。一爲時間問題。一爲金錢問題。然皆不難解决。我人每日工作八小時。睡眠八小時。尙有八小時。即可讀書。假使折半。亦日有四小時書可讀。關於金錢問題。則頗有以現在生活程度高。衣食且時虞不給爲難者。其實應知讀書當與衣食並重腹中須食。腦中亦須食。肚飢無力工作。腦空亦無力工作也。故當節衣縮食以買書讀。月省三元。約計之足買百頁之書三册。字數當在四十八萬以上。年可讀六百萬字矣。繼述讀書四要。曰多讀。多做、多看。多想。又將想一方面。闡發綦詳。大意爲想不怕有幻想。蓋有幻想。始有正確思想出也。但要有正確思想。務須懂得數學幾何學。本國人之馬馬虎虎。大槪。差不多。即爲無數學頭腦之明證。今後必須打倒馬馬虎虎。大槪。差不多。方可談學術。末謂讀書須先認定目標。究竟欲學何種專門學問。然後將與此學問有關係之書籍搜羅。按一定程序研讀、切不可漫無目的。但求其博。結果必博者未能。變成四不像也。先生講時。妙語環生。掌聲不絶。</p>
<h3>觀「爵士歌王」試映後</h3>
<p>— 金開煦</p>
<p>有名安特生者。亦舞台生活中之健者。近竟謂有聲影片出。舞台之生涯。將隨之而銷歇。此不獨小城市中舞台爲然。即紐約之舞台。亦無不受其影響也。夫自無聲影片行於世。社會中多一平民娛樂之媒介。戲劇已受一致命之打擊。然舞台上之歌舞。目能覩而耳不能聞。其興趣亦等於半。故舞台亦終不能取物而代之。乃自有聲影片出。使啞者能言。靜者能聲。闃然者變而爲活潑。收聲容並茂之妙。於是人不必觀舞台上之眞人動作。但須置身銀幕之前。一歌一舞。是聲是色。皆可醉人矣。抑有聲影片之偉大。猶有逈非舞台所能望其項背者。夫舞台限於地位。必不能建築可與攝影塲倫比之舞台。又限於資本。必不能羅集數十百明星於一堂或數百千演員於一地。惟影片能之。明乎此。則知紐約以歌舞負盛名之集格飛及保羅懷滿。皆須賴有聲片。始可悉陳其技之故矣。保羅懷滿爲歌舞中之健者。人或尊之爲王。此爵士歌王之所以名也。「爵士歌王」日前於南京大戲院試映。記者被邀一觀。覺其偉大。非惟舞台上所未能表演。抑亦衆多歌舞影片中之難與競爭者。全部五彩。富麗處可謂已臻絶境。而歌舞之茂盛。尤以末後Melting　Pot　of　Music爲最。幾融音樂之精華於一爐。而成爲現代黃金百鍊之享受品。其歌曲之著者如It　Happeeed　in　Monterey如Song　ofthe　Dawn　I　Like　to　do　Things　for　you等等。皆風行一時之結構也。</p>
<h3>藝壇珍聞錄</h3>
<p>▲楊度書畫展覧　十丈紅塵。俗不可耐。星期日得一日淸閑。欲求一洗耳滌目之地。不可得。不意得之於繫華中心之南京路中。誠出於意料之外。其地維何。即藝乘書畫會是。會爲錢化佛君所主辦。邇來正開楊度書畫展覧會。不佞與金君壽椿偕往。由雲南路拾級豋樓。其時正萬少石居士講經之期。一座二十餘人。肅然靜聽。講題爲禪密密宗要義。惜予不解禪理。乃仰觀楊君之書畫。大半爲條幅。鐵劃銀鈎。高古無倫。而其畫尤别具風格。在淸湘八大之外。非有天資本能。難乎造此妙境。又題化佛所畫惜陰圖。刹那千刦四字。尤令人意遠。嘆觀止矣。（道存）</p>
<p>▲俞語霜遺墨展覧　歸安名畫家俞語霜先生。自歸道山後。名愈震。得其寸縑尺幅者。咸視同拱璧。古歷九月十五日。爲語霜冥誕。知友商笙伯陳文甫馬企周熊松泉錢瘦鐵任堇叔呂十千孫雪泥唐吉生等。假牯嶺路崇法寺。設壇超荐。更附以遺墨展覧會。四壁掛俞先生名畫數十幅。花卉人物仕女山水俱佳。供台兩傍。懸賀天健所撰聯。語極超脫雄渾。而由錢瘦鐵所書者。聯語云。何須賦大招。看滿室畫圖。彷彿靈旗挾雨至。聊以紀生日。痛百年情意。薈凉鄰笛逼人來。見者咸擊節嘆賞。入晚畫家雲集。主僧備素餐欵客。索繪書畫。瘦鐵天健各繪羅漢。松泉繪雙獅。企周書雙鶴。笙伯畫花卉。雪泥畫山水。均由堇叔題詩其上。共合作八幀。主僧歡喜無量。合十頂禮。比及客散。已魚更四躍矣。（燕子）</p>
<p>▲杏花樓預展紀寵　予槖筆海上。倐已三年。涉足蓻林。忝附驥尾。操觚弄翰。積習難除。惜駑駘之材。終非千里之任。惟鍥而不舍。寸聚銖積。漸有進境。一得之愚。未敢自是。遂舉行個人展覧會。以期就正有道。會前特在杏花樓預展蒙諸友好前輩惠然蒞臨。錫以箴規。並荷先訂購。出品爲之一空。高情厚誼。銘感無地。賓虹先生題日眞力彌滿。行氣如虹。包羅萬象。得其寰中。大千居士題曰元氣淋漓幛猶濕。善孖先生與應鵬先生俱題曰琳瑯滿目。山田謙吉先生題曰藝術精華。陶民先生題曰萬山薈翠。弱叟丈題日自成一家。瘦鵑先生題日氣象萬千。堅甫先生題日有巖巖氣象。靑山農先生題日諸相具足。徵白先生題日古茂。公振先生題日墨妙筆精。祖貽先生題日我不能畫而喜讀畫。尤喜讀俞君之畫。逸民先生題日墨趣横生。甘園先生題日烟雲過眼。瘦鐵先生題日縱横古今。紅藢居士題日虚妙。曼靑先生題日一丘一壑自驚人。午昌先生題日與造物者游。寵飾過當。不勝赧顏。用當書紳銘座。以資鞭策。展覧會期爲十五十六十七三天。假西藏路寗波同鄉會四樓舉行。甚盼各界明達有以敎之也。（俞劍華）</p>

<p>余問主人。此地有虎否。主人將烟槍一擱。現不悅之色。日勿如此言。你們要出門。不可如此說。余曰。如何。答曰。只可言大物件而已。余在此十餘年。不聞如此說。余知其含神秘意也。又云。尙有小物件。即豹子也。余又問。有蛇否。曰亦可名老刷。勿言蛇。余問害人否。答無有。不過主人意帶神秘。余不便細問也。</p>
<p>余所不解者。印度人之鬍子也。極長而汚穢。彼不知剃去。云自幼留之。蓋雄性用以壯威耳。余常言女性以美爲美。雄性以能殺爲美。即以大醜爲美也。觀於印人之鬚。殆此意與。</p>
<p>緬人一方面有無常之人生觀。一方面有取樂之人生觀。觀其嗜戱可證也。緬人戲園有自夜達旦之俗。男女嗜戱者。則共眠于園中。漫遊鈞天之樂。有一次。因僧人要求聽戱與政府警察刺殺事。蓋起于緬名花旦普新也。Posing普新旦者。今老矣。緬人之梅蘭芳也。其演票每人四五盾。今有數十萬矣。英政府派侍衛二人守之。普新反對和尙看戱。要求必不賣和尙票乃演。蓋緬戱園中間有和尙優待座。余觀之。自爲二排。且半價也。如我軍人矣。僧人不能反對普新。乃對政府保護普新之警察。竟結隊與警察血戰。結果下令禁止僧人兩人同行。兩僧須距離五十步外方可。經若干日方了。此以知緬人之嗜戱。及僧人之横行也。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（三一五）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　四廂彈涙惆悵紅情　一座傾心低徊綠意</p>
<p>凌趾祥這五六房太太當中。不僅是中國太太。而且還有外國太太有。兩位震驚於歐洲女權發達的朋友。以爲外國太太不知怎樣的難伺候。問他如何融合中西於一爐。不但是内政修明。還是個外交能手。據他說。外國太太也容易伺候。外國的婦女。有外國婦女的脾氣。你要能摸着了他們的脾氣。也沒有什麽了不得。他們也是好面子的。你給還了他們的面子。也就過去了。他們也是講愛情的。伊肯跟了你以後。愛情爲重。當然什麽事都可以商量。倒不比中國女人。有許多非常執拗。有一種特特别别的脾氣。硬功也弗服。軟功也弗受。那眞難弄咧。外國的女子。在外國討來的更不必說。帶伊到中國來。伊一切都莫名其妙。就是生長在上海的女子。伊一向所交往的也都是外國人。中國的情形。也不大明白。中國女人的惡習慣。壞脾氣。他們一點也不曾沾着。外國女人的惡習慣。壞脾氣。旣然嫁了中國人。可以把中國的禮法來裁制伊。所以討外國女人。只要處置得當。也並不是難於對付的。不過最好是外國太太。還是讓伊住在外國太太式的家庭裏。不要和中國太太住在一塊。倘然外國太太做了一個内地雜居。和中國太太同化了以後。那就難辦得多了。所有中國女人的惡習慣。壞脾氣。伊都可以學會了。再加以外國女人固有的惡習慣。壞脾氣。那就永遠弄不好了。凌趾祥這一番話。也有許多人偑服他的。不過討外國太太的人。在中國現在還是少數。在凌趾祥不能不算有獨到之處。要是别一個討外國太太的。不知又有什麽手段咧。總之凌趾祥取的是隔離主義。所以他的呌局。也分出個先後來。不敎他們碰頭。至於那一張局票。在凌字之下。加一個大字。也有一種講究。因爲他們有兩個姓凌的客人。有一個姓凌的。好像是小滑頭模樣。他們不願意出他的局。但又恐怕是凌趾祥呌的。不去却又不好。所以敎凌趾祥在凌字之下。註了一個大字。他目然是大凌。那個沒有註大字的。當然是小凌。這是在局票上做了一種標幟。可以分出個軒輊來。斟酌去與不去。林蕃滋把各人的局票寫下去。到了龍紫耘那裏。便道你是呌鮑媚雲的。我給你寫下去吧。龍紫耘道。不。我寫一個綠意吧。</p>

<h3>釐拆堅靱如故</h3>
<p>▲市場槪况目前金融界氣象蕭條、交易淸淡、對於營業方面、類率因時事不佳、年關爲期匪遙、槪不敢任意擴充、而反從事收縮者、故各項需求、未能有所發展、市氣遂告寂寞、至於厘拆兩種市價、大致平穩、輔幣市况、亦在平靖之中、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市略呈挺狀</h3>

<h3>棉市有軋空聲浪</h3>
<p>棉市趨堅、美棉轉跌、惟本埠人心較堅、買方態度較强、軋空聲勢甚健、故外棉雖跌、多數依然購進、於是檯面較緊、惟有一部份漢帮乘機大批賣出、約有一萬擔、但現棉各廠需要仍滯、且印棉乘機潛入、前途若何、仍依美棉爲轉移也、</p>

<h3>糧食米市堅疲不一</h3>
<p>▲閘北昨日各帮到源二十號左右、本街走消不同、新粳高貨仍開十五元、中關以下均疲兩角、趨勢因去化呆木而欠佳、薄稻銷路益弱、回跌三角、特頂祗開十四元八角、羊秈杜秈高貨挺定、普通因有客胃落手、見好一兩角、市形殊堅、埠尖好起一角、高闰十二元一角半、情况因貨稀而緊俏、變元步短兩角、交易寥寥、頂開十五元二角、陰元一落千丈、按今歲晚帮陰化出品甚劣、是以買方不貪、行情節節下游、刻下特頂祗開十二元零矣、全日各檔市勢大異、粳元均疲、惟秈米獨堅也、</p>
<p>▲滬南昨日河下到源甚旺、計三十餘號、銷塲仍不開展、常頂白粳又短兩三角、且特别粳竟屬寥寥、刻下市高祗開十四元五六角、蘇同白粳亦逐步而下、城鄉走消觀望、價乃續跌、計頂貨勉開十三元、大市十二元半、南帮薄稻呈一蹶不振之象、到源旣接、消塲又滯、於是底貨漸充、買客因之批削、此間特高開十三元半、羊秈來源帶稀、杜尖零拆帶殷、但市况均爲定中帶軟、價格微降角左、陰化又告猛跌、普通大盤已開進十二元關内耳、</p>
<h3>北洋帮暢辦客機元</h3>
<p>▲湘秈略有新到</p>
<p>昨日客秈因厦門等帮擯守不動、本街亦無暢胃、市面更形疲滯、昨日到頭雖以搬運不划而减少、但以去路呆木過甚、形勢終難望好、昨日統市有零戶及鄉户等辦去南京機米一千包、價十元Ｏ一角、十元、次至九元七角半、又新到湖南機油米五十包、價十二元、湘秈因成本太高、久無來源、此次試辦之機油五十包、仍難占利也、惟客元尙爲本客歡迎、昨日新到之湖南機元八百十包、均被北洋帮辦去、但貨多中次、開十四元三角、十三元四角半、次至十三元云、</p>
<h3>粉市大跌小回</h3>
<p>昨日粉市開市後、各月份紛紛下跌、本月份因有中小廠家之洋麥抵埠、買方恐其再有鉅額之售抛、開盤後即爭先回出、行情立見慘落、遠期各月份亦多跟小但祇有一分上落、本月份則狂小二分以上、下午各盤有空頭抵進、本月份回好分許遠期亦均跟起數厘、收市本月份仍小一分二五十二月份小五厘、正月份小二厘半、二月份大二厘半、三·四月份各跌二厘半云、</p>
<h3>麥市疲憊無神</h3>
<p>昨日麥市開市後、上下兩市均見疲軟不堪、實因前日新到兩船洋麥後、人心早均搖動、再有廠家亟亟抛售、市面乃無轉機之望矣、下午收市本月份小三分、下月份小一分、正月份小二分、二月份小一分、三月不動、四月份小一分、現貨各廠進胃均呆、統市祗以回籠麥三百包、價四兩一錢半、亦比前市見疲五分云、</p>

<p>(8) Resolution: The deadline for submitting motions is 6:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>Spirits High at the Meeting</h3>
<p>The atmosphere at the General Assembly this morning was excellent. The spirit of discussion among the committee members was also extremely sincere. It was more satisfactory than the previous sessions. When discussing Chairman Chiang's proposal to revitalize politics, because there were many clauses and the matter was of great importance, there were many speakers, and the research and discussion were very precise. This one case alone took one or two hours, which shows the carefulness of the committees. Also, when discussing Wu Chaochu's proposal to reduce the size of provinces and Chen Mingshu's proposal to revise the principles of provincial administrative divisions, there were many speakers and the discussion was very detailed.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Speaks Four Times</h3>
<p>When the Fourth Plenary Session opened this morning, Zhang Xueliang still arrived on time to attend as an observer. He stood up and spoke four times. (1) When discussing the clause on pardoning political prisoners, Zhang argued that those who have committed acts of treason should not be included in the amnesty. (2) When discussing the clause on eradicating opium addiction within a time limit, Zhang said that the ban on opium should pay attention to customs, and hoped that this would be taken into account when formulating measures in the future. The third and fourth speeches were during the discussion of the Central Supervisory Committee's accusation of members of the expanded meeting. He reported on the behavior of Zhao Daiwen and Shang Zhen during Yan Feng's rebellion. He claimed that because he was in the north, he had more direct knowledge and knew that Zhao not only had no intention of joining the rebellion when it was launched, but also tried to salvage the situation. Later, as the situation changed, he was unable to extricate himself. As for Shang, he was always under pressure from Yan, and the circumstances were even more excusable. He made a brief statement for the Central Committee's reference. Each time he spoke, his attitude was extremely humble and sincere.</p>
<h3>Joint Review Meeting of Each Group</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 14th, the Party Affairs and Political Affairs Groups of the Fourth Plenary Session held a review meeting to continue reviewing the unfinished cases from yesterday. At 2:30 PM, the Economic Group also held a review meeting. At 4:00 PM, the committee members of the General Assembly Presidium and the chairmen of each group held a joint review meeting to review the first, second and third cases discussed at the General Assembly in the morning. The committee members considered these three cases to be very important to the central political system, and the review was extremely careful. It did not break up until after 6:00 PM. It is reported that the committee members, based on the original reasons of the proposers, the initial review opinions, and the opinions of the committee members of the General Assembly today, considered the gains and losses, and conducted a detailed study. Considerable results have been achieved and will be submitted to the third General Assembly for discussion tomorrow.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Hamaguchi Assassinated</h3>
<p>The assassination of the Prime Minister of the Japanese Cabinet. Previously there was Hara Takashi, the president of the Seiyukai, and now there is Hamaguchi, the president of the Minseitō. Hara Takashi, a newspaper reporter, became Prime Minister, and it was called the first civilian cabinet. However, his administration used autocratic methods to oppress the people and despise public opinion, which was difficult for most Japanese to accept. He was assassinated at Tokyo Station on November 4, Taisho 10, by a young man named Nakao Genichi. The Japanese people were very indifferent to it, probably because they sympathized with the Hara cabinet less. Now the Hamaguchi cabinet has been assassinated, and whether his life is in danger is still uncertain. The reason for his assassination is also unclear. However, we see that the Japanese political situation is fraught with difficulties, and we deeply regret Hamaguchi's misfortune. The London Naval Treaty's issue of supreme command had already caused friction in the naval community. Moreover, due to the global economic downturn, his only proposition to implement austerity and gold standard policies was used as an excuse by the opposition in the political struggle. In fact, although austerity measures can lead to increased unemployment in the lower classes, after the Tanaka cabinet's aggressive policies caused financial unease, introducing a passive approach was actually in line with the psychology of the general public. The gold standard was a policy jointly advocated by the Minsei Party and the Seiyukai. It had been arranged during Tanaka's tenure, and Hamaguchi carried it out with meticulous preparation. At that time, it did not cause any unfortunate trends. However, due to the economic trend, various adverse effects occurred in the society, and they were all attributed to these two policies. There were more and more criticisms of Hamaguchi. In fact, to be fair, this kind of adverse effect was not caused by one end, nor could it be saved by one hand. According to the assassin, Sagooya Tomeo, his motive was to restore the economy. If the truth of the assassination is really like this, then it is really Hamaguchi's misfortune. This matter is very important to the future of the Japanese political situation. What kind of changes will occur in the future is unpredictable. If Hamaguchi's injury can turn from danger to safety, it will be fortunate for the Japanese people.</p>
<h3>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>(16) Suggestions regarding the current handling of the military issue in Shanxi, and the aftermath issue in the near future; (17) Abolish the special taxes in Hunan and Hubei within a time limit; (18) Replace the Consul General in the Philippines and appoint someone who understands Party doctrine to fill the position; (19) Strictly order the troops stationed in Fujian to prohibit opium and gambling.</p>

<h3>Summary of Proposals from the Education Group</h3>
<p>The Education Group has a total of five proposals. In addition to Cai Yuanpei's proposal, which was reported in yesterday's newspaper, here are the remaining four, with the general meaning as follows: (A) Zhu Jiahua's proposal: Improve people's entertainment methods so as to impart educational spirit. It is said that the people of our country lack entertainment channels and have poor methods, which hinder their physical and mental health and slow down their work. Looking at the people of other countries, there are many entertainment methods, most of which do not hinder physical and mental development and can also help improve work. Therefore, the strength of a nation can be seen in its entertainment. To passively prohibit bad entertainment, it is necessary to actively promote good entertainment, so as to bring the people into conformity with the norms. It is proposed to use the Party's strength to promote good entertainment and popularize it throughout the country. The methods are: (1) Establish public sports grounds in villages and neighborhoods; (2) Plant trees on vacant land and equip it with sports equipment; (3) Establish popular libraries and agricultural, industrial and commercial product showrooms; (4) Hold various exhibitions regularly in various places; (5) Produce and show films related to work; (6) Compile and print books on the study of implements; (7) Each county should have popular lecturers who go to the countryside to give lectures; (8)</p>
<p>Tidy up scenic spots, facilitate transportation, provide accommodation, and issue travel guides; (9) Establish radio stations in key areas, and establish wireless radios in villages and towns to receive wireless lectures, music, and operas. (B) Zhu Jiahua's proposal: Popularize education and reward academics to build the foundation of the country. It is said that the educational purpose and implementation plan passed by the Third National Congress of our Party, and the educational proposals repeatedly resolved by the Central Executive Committee, have not been implemented due to frequent military uprisings. Now that the country is unified, our Party should establish an educational foundation in the shortest possible time and gradually implement the original plan to complete the mission of political tutelage. Regarding the popularization of education: (1) The regulations on compulsory education in various countries are limited to primary schools. With the progress of civilization, the years of compulsory education are emulated. Initially, it was limited to 14 years old, and then it was increased. Some states in the United States have increased it to 22 years old, and there are hundreds of types of classifications. The progress of agriculture, industry, and commerce in Europe and the United States depends on inventions. Still, it is easy to promote if those who implement it have knowledge. The low level of the people in our country is still the same today, resulting in the bankruptcy of agriculture, industry, and commerce, and the people's livelihood is becoming more difficult. Bandits take the opportunity to incite, and the danger of demise is not abroad but in our own country. Now, in addition to making every effort to popularize education so that there are no out-of-school children, we must also strive to run supplementary education. All men and women under the age of 50 who are illiterate should be ordered to enroll in school in stages. (2) The curriculum should be scheduled for twice a week, two hours each time. The curriculum is set for Party doctrine, civic common sense, and Chinese language, and the rest is arithmetic. (3) The budget, excluding the elderly and young, half of the population, with 50 people per class, is about 4 million classes, 200,000 classrooms, and 400,000 teachers, about 60 million yuan per year. The number of people who can work in the country is 300 million, with each person bearing 20 cents per year. (4) Teachers are selected from rural school teachers and illiterate unemployed people, and given short-term training. Large counties should set up a school and small counties should set up teacher discussion classes. The above methods are to be determined by the Chinese University's guidelines, ordering local authorities in each province to implement them within a time limit. Those who fail to do so within the time limit will be severely punished. The central and provincial educational administrative organs will send personnel to inspect at any time. Regarding rewarding academics: (1) Rewards for writing: 500,000 awards are designated annually for authors. (2) Academic research: It is proposed to designate special funds of 200,000 to 1 million yuan to subsidize academic research and award bonuses, which will be approved by the Central Political Council. Schools in various countries provide special subsidies for academic research outside the budget to encourage them. The effect will be great after ten years. (3) Sending students abroad: It is proposed to select talents who have already achieved research results according to the needs of various places and send them abroad to study every year. The co-signer of this case is Chen Lifu. (C) Zhu Jiahua's proposal, co-signed by Chen Lifu: Please establish a special translation office to translate academic books from various countries, so as to popularize new knowledge to the people and communicate with various countries academically. It is said that academic books in various countries are numerous, while China's are rare. It is urgent to establish a translation office to promote academic research. The methods are: 1. The central government should set up a translation office with a library, equipped with famous works from various countries. 2. In addition to being translated by this office, the books to be translated should also be assigned to university professors to assist in translation. 3. Private translations should be purchased at a premium after being reviewed by this office. 4. Order all provinces to set up libraries and purchase books published by this office for public reading. 5. The books published by this office only charge for printing costs. 6. This office will review and determine the translated names to facilitate unified translation.</p>
<h3>Refreshing Central Politics Proposal</h3>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek, Tai Chuan-hsien, Hu Hanmin, and Wang Chonghui proposed a "Refreshing Central Politics, Improving Systems, Rectifying Discipline, and Establishing a Policy Center within the Shortest Possible Time to Improve Administrative Efficiency" proposal. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>"As the military campaign against the rebels is nearing its end, the great cause of the revolution is increasingly ingrained in the hearts of the people. Our party is responsible for national construction, and our future responsibilities are even more arduous. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the comrades in the central government have spared no effort to govern diligently. However, administrative efficiency is rarely seen, and the neglect of national affairs remains the same. If we continue in this way and refuse to heed the advice of doctors, it will be tantamount to declaring that our party has no ability to execute politics. Even without the instigation of reactionary forces, it would be enough to plunge the people into confusion and hasten the collapse of the country. As the saying goes, changing the strings of an instrument, those who do not have the courage to thoroughly examine themselves are not qualified to talk about revolution; those who do not have the determination to correct mistakes are not qualified to talk about revolution. This is true for individuals, let alone our party, which is a group for revolutionary national salvation and holds the key to rise, fall, survival, and demise. Kai-shek believes that since the revolution, countless comrades and soldiers have sacrificed their lives, and the fields and properties of many people have been sacrificed, but political reform has not seen practical results, and the people's well-being remains a hollow promise. Criticisms are rampant, and sighs fill the streets. We cannot attribute all the blame to the numerous obstacles of rebellion and the people's incomplete understanding of the revolution. This plenary session is held today when the military campaign has ended and unification has been firmly established. There should be clear and significant reforms to open up a new path for future efforts and to comfort the nation's hope for a new beginning. In addition to the party affairs section, the congress should be asked to analyze the reasons for its shortcomings, identify the root causes of its problems, and discuss detailed plans for improvement. As for the political part, Kai-shek believes that (1) there are systems and organizations that should be enriched and improved, (2) there are customs that should be corrected and malpractices that should be eliminated, and (3) a policy center and policy guidelines should be established to prioritize matters. I will first analyze the crux of the problem and then list the solutions.</p>
<p>(1) Systems and Organizations of the Central Government that Should Be Enriched and Improved: The Central Executive Committee of our party is the highest organ for initiating politics, and the central government delegates this power and responsibility to the Central Political Council. The Political Council decides on major national policies and plans, and the National Government implements them. The lines of authority are connected, and the levels are well-defined. During the period when constitutional government is not yet implemented, in order to implement politics in accordance with the policies and strategies of our party, the Political Council must be the central hub. Therefore, the power of the central cadres must be concentrated here. Some members of the Central Political Council cannot always be in the capital, and some are responsible for local affairs. The effect of gathering ideas from all sides is rarely seen, and the idea of division of labor and collective action is gradually lost. This is the first point to be noted. The resolutions of the Political Council are implemented by the National Government through various departments. However, what is the actual state of implementation of the various departments, and whether the various cases that are scheduled to be implemented are implemented on time? The various departments do not directly report to the Political Council, nor does the Political Council directly inspect and supervise them. As a result, the general situation of government affairs is often not fully understood by the Political Council, and it is difficult to base decisions on anything. If there is no connection between the two, the original intention of the creation will gradually be lost, and the wonderful coordination between the body and limbs will be lacking, and the flexibility of guidance and application will be lost. This is the second point to be noted. The current regulations of the Political Council stipulate the establishment of special secretaries in groups, but due to the complexity of party and government affairs, it is not easy to find talent, and so far, it has not been fully established. The heads of the political staff of a country lack specialized talent to assist them. When there are major problems, sufficient materials are not collected in advance, and after specialized and detailed research, they can only be discussed temporarily by the committee members of each group, which is often hasty and prone to omissions. Moreover, even those specialized talents who are good at academics are often not connected with practical administration, and their research and contributions are often unable to be implemented effectively. This is the third point to be noted. Ninety percent of a country's politics are administrative issues. If the administrative organs can be sound and enriched, then all government affairs will be carried out. Under the current National Government Organization Law, the ministers of the various departments of the Executive Yuan cannot attend the State Council meetings, so the implementation of various important government affairs cannot be directly responsible to the National Government. At each session of the Executive Yuan meeting, only formal votes are taken on the proposals of the various departments. Most of the discussions are about the cases of appointing officials and positions. They do not have time to conduct a comprehensive study of the overall administration. As a result, the spirit of the various departments is scattered, the powers and responsibilities are unclear, and they gradually lose their sense of position and responsibility. The various measures taken may inevitably differ from the spirit of the resolutions of the State Council, and the administrative efficiency is declining day by day. This is the fourth point to be noted. The establishment of institutions must be commensurate with the complexity of actual government affairs, and must also be in line with the political and economic situation of a country. Only then can people have no redundant leisure and affairs have no delays. Now that the economy and the people's livelihood are both in decline, on the one hand, everything is waiting to be revived, and the strength of the country cannot be done at the same time. This cannot be compared with countries where the social economy has reached a considerable development and government affairs need detailed division of labor. If too many administrative organs are established, not only will government spending swell and the national treasury will be burdened, but also the functions and powers will be difficult to distribute. Under the current system, the various ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan have overlapping functions and powers between each other, and the facilities cannot be unified. Some affairs are relatively simple and there is no need to set up a special department. If they are not considered for consolidation, it will not be easy to comprehensively verify the reality. This is the fifth point to be noted.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Correction of Political Customs and the Improvement of Facilities: The disadvantages of today's politics are inherent in the system and organization, and the failure to eliminate old habits and the failure to achieve perfection in facilities are also important main reasons. To cite the most obvious ones, there are about several points. First, the division of powers and responsibilities is not clear enough. Today's various departments mostly govern themselves and forget that they are an integral part of the entire government. In implementing government affairs, they not only lack the spirit of cooperation, but also often infringe on the powers of other agencies. Disputes and grabs never end. In reality, they only compete for authority without fulfilling their responsibilities. The matters in charge encompass everything, but in actual implementation, there is not even one in ten. This is because the chief officials in charge of the various departments do not understand their position and responsibilities, and the petty officials do not know the overall situation. They first have a mind of boundaries and only plan to decorate the facade, resulting in duplication, conflict, and mutual abandonment of government facilities. Government orders are confusing and the system is chaotic. On the one hand, the entire administrative body is cut into several unconnected longitudinal sections. At the same time, several longitudinal sections often grind against each other. This is the first. Second, the criteria for appointment are not strict. In the past, due to the lack of an established examination system and the various laws and regulations on selection and assessment were not complete, and it was also the beginning of the establishment of revolutionary power, the political candidates were naturally strictly defined, which was not enough to guarantee the implementation of our party's policies. However, technical specialists and administrative officials have never been restricted in any way. However, those in charge of the administration of various departments often fail to understand this meaning and use them properly, resulting in a narrow scope on the one hand, showing the world that it is not broad enough, and the various departments only ask about relationships and not about virtue. Inferior horses are shameless in their good fortune, and those with great insight are content with staying in place. There is a sigh of difficulty in finding talent at all levels of politics. Now that the warlords have been eliminated and the vision and hearing are unified, there is no need to worry that real talent will not serve the party and the country. I only worry that we will not be able to make good use of the talents in the country. But if the leadership is proper, it will inspire the atmosphere, accommodate the strengths of all, and make them adhere to the doctrine and work together, which is not difficult. Therefore, in the future, the standard for employing people should be talent and personality. The responsible officials at all levels should be given the power to employ people, and their assessment should be strict. If there is improper employment, the person in charge must be held accountable. Only in this way can the virtuous and capable rise to advancement and the political path be fulfilled. Otherwise, the party and the country will only be criticized for their small scale, and politics will still be plagued by mediocrity. This is the second. Third, there is no respect for the system. Today, the various agencies mostly fail to implement the government orders of the higher levels. For example, the work reports of the daily administration often have delays in submission, and even the government orders and resolutions of the higher levels are ignored and there is not a single report. Even those who submit on time often fill in the reported matters incompletely and inaccurately. After a long time, it gradually becomes a mere formality, and the so-called supervision and assessment will only exist in form. For example, although the central government has promulgated the trial budget regulations, the various departments have not yet uniformly established a budget. The actual organization of the various departments, the exact number of employed personnel, and the actual situation of income and expenditure have never been submitted to the National Government for detailed reporting. Not only the funds of the organs are like this, but even the income of their responsible departments is not regarded as part of the national income, but as the income of their department. They are often kept separately and arbitrarily distributed, reducing the national revenue and obstructing the unification of accounting. Regardless of how the actual spending is, this spirit of fragmentation is not appropriate for a country under the rule of law. This is the third. Fourth, laxity and lack of responsibility. The central government affairs are extremely complicated, and the period of political tutelage has a fixed limit. Working hard from morning to night, I am still afraid that it will not be enough. But today, the various departments are not only redundant in personnel and improperly distributed, but also signing in and sitting idle are everywhere. Even directors and above often travel between Beijing and Shanghai, regarding it as a weekly routine. They often leave the capital on Friday evening and cannot return to the department until Monday. During a week, those who are on duty and perform their duties do not exceed five days, while wandering on the sea often takes two or three days. Stealing time to this extent, how is this different from the Beijing government of the past? They have become accustomed to it and are not surprised by it. The slackness of discipline can be seen from this. This is the fourth. Fifth, the wind of corruption has not been completely eliminated. Many of the officials in the various departments are old officials from Beijing. At the beginning of the establishment of the government, did they not all warn each other and dare not try their luck under the revolutionary government? But as time passed, the discipline was not established, and the old corrupt customs were transplanted to the new capital one by one. Today's various agencies, not only the lower officials in the last office cannot eliminate the malpractice of the public treasury, but it is also heard that even the government officials in charge of political affairs above the director personally sign contracts and openly collect commissions when purchasing materials from China and abroad, and this is especially true for foreign goods. Other bribery and speculation, using national public office as a tool for trading, or slanders are flying in the streets, or rumors are spreading throughout foreign countries. Isn't it true that people are talking about it? If the chief officials in charge do not knowingly indulge them and divide the spoils, they are muddleheaded and abandon their power and responsibility of supervision. For example, administrative officials are not allowed to engage in commerce. In the imperial era, it was known to be a strict prohibition. It is true that officials should serve the public and should cut themselves off from the pursuit of wealth, in order to prevent the abuse of power and convenience. Today, there are central government officials who also hold positions in commercial institutions, and there are even officials in office who engage in speculation for profit, tarnishing the officialdom, affecting politics, and causing a lot of slander. Is this accidental? This is the fifth. Sixth, they do not understand the essentials of politics and are close to triviality, competing with the people for profit. All enterprises with monopolistic characteristics and those that private individuals cannot operate are operated by state capital. This is clearly stipulated in our party's political program. However, at a time when the economy is not yet developed and construction is just beginning, state-owned enterprises have no concrete scale. It is appropriate to encourage private industries and provide appropriate protection. However, in the government, there are often misunderstandings of the essence of the political program, failing to distinguish the importance of relationships, and disregarding public sentiment, and often considering the recovery of private enterprises as a good idea. What is especially criticized by the general public is the recovery of small private electric power enterprises and the confiscation of private mines that have just sprouted. The news has spread, making the people fearful and suspicious that the government is using power to compete with the people for profit. For industrial and commercial enterprises, they all warn each other and dare not invest. Such driving capital out of the industry not only makes the national economy increasingly depleted, but also drives fish into the abyss, helping the international economic invasion. This is the sixth. Seventh, inertia and hesitation, following emotions and not being able to bear resentment. As mentioned above, the politics of today are full of flaws and evils, and the measures taken are also inappropriate. However, I have not heard of a special agency specially investigating and prosecuting a person who abuses the law for personal gain, nor have I heard of a chief official in charge punishing a person who exceeds the law and disrupts the discipline. They are mostly constrained by emotions, observing the situation, knowing what they mean but afraid to act. They have become accustomed to it and are afraid to be the first. They tolerate each other and forgive each other, only forgetting the responsibilities assigned by the party and the country, and selling favors. There has never been a person who stands up to break all restrictions and bear the responsibility of rectifying discipline for the country. How can we seek to clarify politics in this way? Therefore, the lack of vigor in today's laws and disciplines is not only due to the lack of implementation of the supervisory system, but also because the atmosphere of hating evil as if it were an enemy is disappearing day by day. This is the seventh.</p>
<p>(3) Reasons for Establishing a Policy Center and Policy Guidelines in the Shortest Possible Time: The improvement of the system and the rectification of discipline are as described above. If we want to improve administrative efficiency and make the people benefit from politics, we must weigh the importance and urgency, and determine a concise and practical plan to select one or two of the most urgent cases and concentrate all efforts to achieve them. As the ancient saying goes, knowing what to do first is the great principle of governing. The most harsh criticism of our party's politics is "everything</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>is done, but nothing is accomplished." Although this is the criticism of the streets, it is enough for our self-reflection. After a major change in the country, the national strength and the people's strength are both exhausted. Those who are in charge of administration, if they do not understand the limitations of the facts and only have the mentality of seeking quick success, make plans that are detailed and comprehensive. No matter how beautiful the plan is, it will inevitably fall into the predicament of being unable to advance or retreat due to the country's financial resources. As a result, agencies are established everywhere, businesses are suspended, and talents and national resources are not economical. Moreover, today, when the military is roughly settled and the bandits and communists are rampant, it is especially appropriate to prioritize what should be prioritized and postpone what should be postponed. Therefore, the central government should determine the policy center of the country and the policy guidelines of the local government within the shortest period of one year, and devote the spiritual and material strength of the whole country to ensure that it is implemented. On the negative side, we should remove the worst and most harmful things, focus all our efforts on removing the most harmful and most criticized things to the nation. On the positive side, we should also concentrate our efforts on rectifying the most important and urgent prerequisites for the stability and progress of all government affairs. Local administration should also determine its most important work guidelines under the two major conditions of stabilizing the people's livelihood and cultivating the people's strength, so that they are consistent with the central government's policy center and do not conflict with each other. Once the goals are simple and the strength is concentrated, then the general principles will be clear and the specific details will be clear. If it is implemented for a year, it will be effective. Based on the above reasons, I respectfully propose the following items:</p>
<p>A. Regarding the Reform of the Central System and Organization (A) Enforce that over two-thirds of the members of the Central Political Council permanently reside in the Central Government. (B) Strengthen the organization of the Secretariat of the Central Political Council; All special secretaries of various groups such as diplomacy, military affairs, finance, economics, education, law, and local autonomy must be fully established. (C) The political vice ministers of the various departments of the Executive Yuan shall be filled by the special secretaries of the related groups of the Political Council, and all official documents of the various departments, whether internal or external, must be countersigned by the political vice minister in order to be valid. (D) Revise the regulations concerning the State Council and the Executive Yuan Council in the Organic Law of the National Government.

(2) The Ministry of Health should be merged into the Ministry of Interior.

The model projects that have been tried should continue to be implemented, but no new projects should be created, so as to design well and focus on urging the development of private enterprises. (4) The organization of other ministries and commissions should be reduced as much as possible, and the number of personnel should be strictly determined and decided by the Central Political Council.</p>
<p>B. Regarding the Program for Rectifying Discipline and Refreshing Politics (A) The National Government shall issue a general amnesty on New Year's Day of the Republic of China in 1920, except for the heinous criminals who betrayed the Party and the country and the communists, other political prisoners should be pardoned to show leniency. The Judicial Yuan shall discuss the scope, hand it over to the Legislative Yuan for discussion, and submit it to the National Government for execution.

(C) The Supervisory Yuan shall be established within a time limit to implement the supervisory powers, and the regulations on the punishment of supervisory personnel for dereliction of duty and misconduct shall be formulated. (D) The powers and responsibilities of the various ministries and commissions shall be clearly defined.

The scope of powers and responsibilities shall be clearly defined, especially regarding the management and operation of state-owned enterprises, so that private enterprises can be guaranteed. (E) Various laws and regulations for implementing examinations at all levels and implementing qualifications and selections shall be implemented within a time limit, and each agency shall be required to send a detailed table of personnel advances and retreats and the number of personnel and salaries every three months to the superior agency. If the qualification of the personnel is concealed or the personnel is employed beyond the quota, the chief official in charge shall be punished. (F) Implement the reduction of government, cut and merge redundant agencies, and abolish them. The Central Political Council shall decide on the principles and hand them over to the National Government for implementation at each level. (G) The Accounting Office shall be established within a time limit and be directly under the National Government. All central agencies shall be limited to the end of December this year, and local governments shall be limited to March of 1920, to prepare the agency budget for the fiscal year and the budget within its scope of responsibility, and submit it to the National Government for approval. Thereafter, the revenue and expenditure statements and supporting documents of each agency must be sent in accordance with the law for review and approval. Those who violate the law shall be admonished or punished, and the chief official in charge shall be punished. If the audit finds expenditures that do not comply with legal procedures or evidence of fraud, the audit agency shall submit it to the Supervisory Yuan for handling. (H) The Legislative Yuan shall formulate regulations for punishing corruption and embezzlement.

(J) According to the central government's resolution, the Accounting Bureau shall be established within a time limit to implement the unification of accounting. Hereafter, the various ministries and commissions shall no longer be allowed to directly allocate the funds within their scope of responsibility in the name of special accounting. All national income and Geng funds, regardless of their nature, must be deposited in the Central Bank and the National Bank acting as the national treasury, and the establishment of various banks by the various ministries and commissions is strictly prohibited in order to achieve the effect of unification.</p>
<p>C. Policy Center and Policy Guidelines within the Shortest Possible Time (A) The goal of politics within the next year should be to stabilize order and cultivate the people's strength, concentrate efforts to eliminate the greatest evils, and meet the country's most urgent needs. (B) The policy center of the Central Government: (1) On the negative side, focus on the work of eliminating communism, suppressing bandits, banning opium, and abolishing likin. (2) On the positive side, focus on military rehabilitation and financial consolidation. Secondly, if there is any spare energy, then develop transportation and water conservancy. (C) The policy guidelines of the local government should focus on (1) eliminating bandits, (2) investigating household registration, (3) establishing Baojia system, (4) encouraging agricultural production, (5) popularizing education, and rectifying the academic atmosphere, and finally on the promotion of local autonomy and the completion of the autonomous organization. (D) Regarding the elimination of communism and the suppression of bandits, the central government should regard it as the most important and urgent task, and the party, government, army, and people should cooperate with all their strength and earnestly cooperate, and strive to complete it within three to six months. In necessary areas, temporary overall command organs may be established, and the measures shall be decided by the Central Political Council. (E) Starting from January 1 of 1920, a three-year limit shall be set for completing the opium ban. One-third shall be reduced each year, and the ban shall be completely eliminated by the end of the third year. The Special Tax Agency and the Opium Prohibition Committee shall jointly handle it. After the central government promulgates the measures, if anyone privately transports drugs and is found, the National Government may impose additional punishments in accordance with extraordinary procedures. (F) It is decided to implement the abolition of likin on January 1 of 1920, and the provinces shall not request an extension for any reason. (G) Commend those who have worked hard for the revolution and have made contributions to the country and society, and the state shall grant them annuities. (H) The following are the guidelines for military rehabilitation: (1) Military rehabilitation includes the following tasks, which shall be completed within six months to one year: 1. Determination of the establishment and enrichment of the troop strength, 2. Clearance of arrears of pay, 3. Elimination and resettlement of the old and weak, 4. Placement and accommodation of officers and soldiers outside the quota, 5. Rehabilitation of wounded and sick soldiers, and compensation for deceased officers and soldiers, 6. Formulation of preliminary national defense plans, 7. Regulations on the military regions other than the bandit suppression troops, 8. Closure of wartime agencies and clearance of the anti-rebel military expenses, 9. Reorganization and replenishment of clothing and military supplies. (2) The expenses for military rehabilitation shall be raised separately and shall not hinder the budget for normal government and military expenses. However, the construction of other positive aspects within this one-year period should be appropriately reduced or postponed. No department shall issue public bonds for matters under its jurisdiction, and those that have been issued but have not been fully raised shall be postponed. (3) The special funds raised for military rehabilitation shall be managed by the Central Military and Political Organs together with the financial industry and related groups to organize a Special Fund Management Committee for Military Rehabilitation. All revenue and expenditure shall be reported publicly. (I) Regarding local autonomy, it shall be urged to proceed in accordance with the original procedures, and attention shall be paid to the organization and selection of personnel in the district, township, and town offices, so that the outstanding elements of the local middle-level society and the honest and reliable people of the countryside can live peacefully in their hometown, follow the doctrine of our party, and participate in the work of local autonomy as much as possible. The measures shall be formulated by the Central Training Department and the Ministry of Interior. (J) Regarding the consolidation of finance, the clearance of internal and external debts, and the establishment of a financial foundation, the Ministry of Finance shall formulate a plan within a time limit and submit it for approval.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, without improving the central system and organization, there is no way to expect the agile implementation of government affairs. Without vigorously rectifying discipline, there is no way to improve administrative efficiency. In particular, without establishing a political work center in the shortest possible time, there is no way to concentrate efforts and achieve practical results. Therefore, based on what I have seen, I propose the above. Whether it is appropriate or not, please decide."</p>
<h3>Proposal to Eliminate Communist Bandits within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting proposed a proposal to eliminate communist bandits in various places within a time limit. The original text said: Since the Yan-Feng rebellion, communist bandits in various places have taken the opportunity to be rampant, burning, killing, looting, and raping, which is unbearable to hear. Among them, the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Shaanxi have suffered the most. Now that the rebellion has been quelled, the most important government policy is construction. However, if the communist bandits in various places are not eliminated for one day, then no matter whether it is agriculture, industry, or commerce, people cannot live and work in peace. Even if there is a good plan, it cannot be implemented. Moreover, the methods adopted by the communist bandits are the most cruel. They not only inflict cruelty on the people of our country, but also capture and loot foreigners in various places. Their intention is nothing more than to provoke diplomacy in order to achieve the purpose of destruction. In recent months, looking around the areas with bandits, transportation is blocked, people's livelihood is deteriorating, and all kinds of businesses have gone bankrupt. Under these circumstances, even if the government has a very precise construction plan, I am afraid that it will be a case of drawing a cake to satisfy hunger. I hereby propose that the government mobilize capable troops and strive to eliminate the communist bandits in the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Henan and other places within three months in order to secure the people's livelihood and benefit construction. Whether it is appropriate or not, please decide.</p>
<h3>Proposal Regarding Matters Under the Jurisdiction of Construction</h3>
<p>Sun Ke proposed that for new construction projects, the government departments in charge should be directly responsible for handling them, and it is not appropriate to establish separate agencies at any time to avoid redundancy and save public funds. The original text reads: "In my humble opinion, the government establishes various departments to manage various undertakings throughout the country. In terms of their duties, they are not only administrative and supervisory bodies, but also responsible for planning and operating various construction projects under their jurisdiction. Moreover, according to the organizational law, each department establishes official positions and employs talented individuals. If the work within the departments is not substantial and the staff are idle, it would be a great loss to the original intention of the government in establishing these departments. However, recently, when the government plans various new construction projects, it often establishes a separate and independent agency for each new project, either because the scale is considered too large, or the progress is too urgent, or even due to personal considerations. Although there may be various reasons for the central government's decision at the time, the resulting malpractices are that various departments cannot interfere with the undertakings under their jurisdiction, lose their duties, and become idle. At the same time, the newly established agencies are large in scale, with numerous staff, and consume tens of thousands of public funds each month. Both talent and finances are uneconomical, and conflicts of authority often occur, which is not a good plan. Now that the great calamity has been quelled and military affairs have ended, the number of new undertakings to be launched will inevitably increase day by day. I believe that all construction projects that should be planned in the future should be handled directly by the relevant departments in charge, in accordance with the provisions of the organizational law of the various departments promulgated by the government, so that redundant agencies will not be established too often, the administrative system will not be disrupted, and the annual savings of public funds will also be considerable. Whether this is appropriate, I respectfully await your public decision."</p>
<h3>Proposal on Strictly Prohibiting the Enlistment of Bandits</h3>
<p>Liu Zhi proposed strictly prohibiting military division and brigade commanders from enlisting bandits and promoting party-based education to awaken those who have mistakenly joined the Communist Party. The general idea is that since the rise of the revolutionary army, wars have frequently occurred throughout the country, with almost no peaceful year, leading to widespread suffering and mountains full of bandits. During the warlord era, the enlistment of bandits was used to expand personal power, resulting in a cycle of soldiers and bandits, with the quality of soldiers deteriorating and the banditry becoming more rampant. The Communist Party took advantage of this, and the situation became increasingly uncontrollable. Fortunately, the military campaign to suppress the rebellion is about to end, and both Heaven and people desire unification. It is proposed that the conference instruct the National Government to issue an order to all military commanders, prohibiting the enlistment of bandits to curb the source of chaos. As for the Communist Party's thugs who specialize in murder and arson, they should be promptly suppressed by force to prevent them from becoming a prairie fire. A portion of young people, due to their unstable minds, are lured by the Communist Party's heresies and mistakenly embark on the wrong path. Party-based education should be promoted, the essence of the Three People's Principles should be elucidated, and the propaganda power of our party should be expanded, penetrating the inner layers of the people to win their hearts, so that these young people can be awakened, thereby reducing national losses and achieving long-term stability.</p>
<h3>Four Proposals for Rectifying Party Affairs</h3>
<p>He Chengjun has four proposals on party affairs. The main points are extracted below: (A) Proposal on stipulating the work of party members. The training of party members is one of the most important tasks of our party. The recognition of party doctrine, the observance of party regulations, the cultivation of party morality, and the implementation of resolutions by all party members must be carefully examined and perfected in order to engage in training, and it must be universal and correct in order to be effective. At present, the party departments in various districts are becoming increasingly decadent, and the training work is simply at a standstill. The malpractices have almost led to party members breaking away from the party departments. Those who run the party should earnestly rectify this phenomenon. Party members should also intensify their training. From now on, the provincial party departments should instruct the training departments of the city, county, and district party departments to stipulate the monthly and quarterly work methods for formal and probationary party members, which can be divided into two aspects. First, the scope of work for each formal party member each quarter should be based on the central government's predetermined principles for party member training. The scope of work each month should be determined according to the environment. The completion of the work must be reported in writing, and the party department will use it as a basis for continuous assessment to determine the quality of the performance. Second, the scope of work for probationary party members is the same as above, but during the probationary period, they must cultivate the idea of ​​loyalty to the doctrine and enhance their revolutionary enthusiasm. If their performance is excellent, the directly subordinate party department may submit it to the higher-level party department for approval to be promoted to formal party members. (B) Proposal to reduce the number of county party department units. The general idea is that most of the party departments below the county level cannot connect with the higher-level party departments. To remedy this, the only way is to reduce the number of county party department units in order to engage in the rectification of discipline. The methods are: 1. County divisions with a small number of party members who are ignorant of the people's wisdom will not temporarily establish county party departments. The established district party departments and sub-district party departments will be affiliated to the county party departments and district party departments of their neighboring counties. 2. Those with fewer than 500 party members or fewer than three district party departments will not temporarily establish county party departments, but they may establish directly subordinate district party departments. 3. County divisions that are connected enough to form three or more directly subordinate district party departments may jointly form a county party department. (C) Proposal to train cadres and talents for party departments. Our party is a revolutionary political party, and the Three People's Principles are the guide for our party's efforts. All personnel in charge of party department work must have their personality established and their morality cultivated. They must have a firm understanding of the party's doctrine and hold it permanently, with life and death as their goal and unswerving. Only then can they shoulder the revolutionary task and complete the revolutionary mission. However, a look at the current staff of party departments at all levels is not only insufficient to meet this expectation, but also disappointing. In order to remedy this situation, the most important thing is the training of cadres and talents for party departments. The method should be to establish a party affairs cadre school by the Central Training Department, and implement both examination and selection methods when collecting students. Only in this way can revolutionary talents be selected and practical training results be achieved. As for future service in various places, two points should be noted: 1. The central government must stipulate its work standards and phased plans, and conduct assessments at any time. 2. The treatment should be improved and the living expenses should be increased so as to restrain their greed and cultivate their integrity. (D) Proposal that party affairs inspectors should be concurrently held by Central Committee members and Provincial Committee members. The methods are roughly as follows: (1) During the adjournment of the plenary session of the Central Executive Committee, in addition to the Standing Committee members, the remaining executive and supervisory committee members may concurrently serve as party affairs inspectors and go to various provinces for inspection. (2) The provincial party departments in various provinces, in addition to retaining one of the standing committee members to perform daily affairs, the remaining executive and supervisory committee members may concurrently serve as party affairs inspectors and go to various counties, cities, and districts for inspection. (3) If the central inspector discovers the decadence of party affairs, the errors of work, and the negligence of the provincial committee of the party department of each province during the inspection period, he may submit it to the Central Standing Committee at any time for rectification or punishment. (4) If the provincial inspector discovers the decadence of party affairs, the errors of work, and the negligence of the committee members at all levels of the city, county, and district party departments during the inspection period, he may submit it to the Provincial Standing Committee at any time for rectification or punishment. (5) The central inspectors must submit the entire report to the Central Standing Committee after the inspection results in various provinces, and the Central Standing Committee will then submit it to the plenary session of the Central Executive Committee, so that the direction of promoting party affairs across the country can be determined. (6) The provincial inspectors must submit the entire report to the Standing Committee after the inspection results in various cities, counties, and districts, so that they can clearly understand the actual situation of the lower-level party departments and plan and develop strategies at any time.</p>
<h3>Proposal on Conducting Local Self-Government</h3>
<p>Chen Zhaoying proposed that in conducting local self-government, we should first pay attention to training personnel, and take into account economic talents, and proceed in an orderly manner. The methods are: (1) In conducting local self-government in each province, the leading county in the old prefectural jurisdiction should be the first to conduct it, and the county magistrates of other counties in the same prefectural jurisdiction should select a number of people who have considerable faith in the local area and gather them in the leading county for training together. (2) The training personnel should be filled by members of the provincial government who do not serve as heads of departments, and other personnel with higher positions and more idle duties, who will go to the leading county for on-site training. (3) The training period shall be set at three months. (4) During the training period, the trainees selected by the counties must be attached to the leading county to conduct local self-government as on-site practice. (5) After the training period expires, the trainees selected by the counties will be sent back to their original counties, and the county magistrate will select those with better performance and report them to the provincial government to be appointed as district chiefs to conduct local self-government in the county.</p>
<h3>Proposal on Guaranteeing People's Freedom</h3>
<p>Chen Mingshu's proposal to guarantee people's freedom is as follows: "The freedoms of people's person, property, speech, publication, assembly, and association were originally listed in our party's political program, and have also been demonstrated in the declarations and orders issued by the National Government since its establishment. However, during the military administration period, the government had to impose considerable restrictions on various freedoms of the people in order to eliminate obstacles to the revolution. During the political tutelage period, it was also due to the military actions of suppressing the rebellion. Now, although there are various proclamations and laws to protect freedom, they cannot be effectively implemented due to the necessity of facts. In addition, due to the incompleteness of the law, the executors have no basis, and the entry and exit are light or heavy, losing their balance. The people feel the pain of freedom being arbitrarily restricted, and increasingly doubt the law on which the restrictors are based. The harms are as follows: (1) The people's freedom is not effectively guaranteed, and on the one hand, it is the government officials who have no clear responsibility, and the unscrupulous can use the cause as a pretext for wrongdoing. (2) Without effective protection of property, investors will stop and not move forward, and there will be no way for industry and commerce to develop. (3) Without the freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association explicitly granted by law, public opinion cannot be expressed, and the power of the government will become empty. Reactionaries can use the suspicious psychology of the general public to take advantage of and spread rumors and incite. The above harms must be remedied in the following ways:</p>
<p>(1) Those who have set up methods to protect the freedom of the people in law should implement them effectively. There is more than one aspect of the law to protect freedom. The Civil Law, the Criminal Law, the Litigation Law, and all administrative laws and regulations were originally aimed at protecting freedom. Most of these laws have been promulgated and implemented. There are five concrete ways to promote implementation: A. The Central Party Department should issue orders to all subordinate party departments and party members to strictly prohibit actions that violate freedom without legal basis. At the same time, the National Government should issue orders to all administrative and judicial organs in the country that no people shall be arrested without following the procedures of the Police Law and the Criminal Procedure Law, and no freedom of property shall be infringed without following administrative laws and regulations (such as the Land Expropriation Law, etc.). If there are those who are instructed by party department party members, individuals, or mass organizations to illegally infringe on the freedom of person or property, the official in charge shall bear the responsibility himself. In addition to constituting a crime under ordinary criminal law, special criminal law shall be used to stipulate the method of punishment. B. The government should issue orders to mass organizations that, whether for their members or the people outside the organization, they shall not take actions that infringe on freedom without legal basis, and must absolutely comply with the sanctions of the law. C. Military organs, except during martial law, if there are actions to arrest people or harm the freedom of property, other laws shall be used to stipulate or amend the current laws and regulations to allow judicial organs to exercise their power of trial, and the government shall use effective methods to protect the judicial organs in exercising these powers. D. The National Government shall determine the judicial funding of the central and provincial governments, and shall stipulate laws to increase the powers of judicial organs, and shall formulate a law on court appearances to make the court responsible for effectively protecting the freedom of the people. E. The Administrative Litigation Law and the Organizational Law of the Administrative Court shall be formulated as soon as possible, and the Administrative Court shall be established immediately. The organization shall be based on the principle of facilitating the people to exercise administrative litigation.</p>
<p>(2) For those who have not formulated laws, the National Government must formulate them as soon as possible. There are several important parts concerning the freedom of the people that have not been formulated into laws: A. Publication, B. Association, C. Assembly. The above three laws shall be determined by the Political Conference to determine its principles, and handed over to the Legislative Yuan to formulate it within a time limit. Other administrative laws and regulations must also be sorted out strictly within a time limit. Combining the above effective implementation of the protection methods in the established law, the people's freedom can be fully protected. Is it appropriate? I respectfully await your public decision. Proposer: Chen Mingshu, co-signers: Liu Wendao, Zhu Jiahua, Wu Jingheng, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wang Boling, Yang Shuzhuang, Li Shizeng.</p>
<h3>Proposal on Unified Management of Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Fang Juehui proposed a method for unifying the dispatch and management of students studying abroad, saying that the Ministry of Education and various provinces have set up public-funded quotas for studying abroad. Recently, the Central Party Department and the various departments and committees of the National Government have dispatched students to study abroad, and military commanders in the country have also privately sent students to study abroad. If this continues, if the central government does not thoroughly rectify the problem of studying abroad and unify the power to dispatch and manage it in the Central Party Department, the accumulated malpractices of studying abroad will become more and more serious, and the academic future will be unimaginable. Therefore, the following methods are proposed: (1) The central government shall establish a committee for the examination and management of studying abroad to be in charge of matters such as the examination and management of studying abroad. (2) All students who pass the entrance examination for studying abroad must be trained by the committee for three months to assess their interests and abilities. (3) The committee shall investigate the number of students to be sent abroad in the future, the funding, and the subjects to be entered. (4) Students to be sent abroad shall be subject to preliminary examination by the original dispatching agency and re-examination by the committee. The qualifications for the examination shall be determined separately, but revolutionary youths who have served in the party for more than six years may be assisted by other methods if their qualifications and level do not meet the requirements. (5) All national universities, in order to train specialized teachers, can be exempted from re-examination for sending professors at their own expense, but they only need to report to the committee for record. (6) The funding for studying abroad shall be borne by the original dispatching agency, and the committee shall review the amount and hand it over to the committee for remittance, so as to avoid delays and differences in treatment.</p>
<h3>Proposal on the Central Government Recruiting Talents</h3>
<p>Liu Zhi proposed to concentrate talents and enrich the central cadres to promote construction. Our party is responsible for building the country with the party, saving the country with the party, and governing the country with the party. When the Premier was in Japan, heroes from all directions followed the scenery, but it is still insufficient to build the country. In recent years, party cadres have sacrificed for the revolution. In addition, due to drastic changes in the situation, party cadres have been divided many times, and talents are becoming increasingly scarce. Now that the military campaign to suppress the rebellion is coming to an end, it is time to start anew with the people. We should do our best to recruit specialized talents from all over the country to enrich the various departments and offices of the central government to promote construction and shoulder difficult tasks.</p>
<h3>Proposal on Establishing Special Administrative Regions</h3>
<p>Lu Diping proposed the establishment of special administrative regions, saying, "In order to propose, I have investigated that the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian have been repeatedly disturbed by bandits and Communists, and have suffered from burning, killing, and looting for a long time. The red atmosphere is pervasive, and the poison is deep. The bandit areas where bandits and Communists have occupied for the longest time, such as Liuyang and Pingjiang in eastern Hunan, Dayong and Sangzhi in western Hunan, Lianhua, Ninggang, and Yongxin in western Jiangxi, Donggu and Mobanshan in eastern Jiangxi, and Honghu in Hubei, have been mired in bandit lairs for a long time, and the people have also been deeply poisoned. The army's suppression can only eliminate a limited number of bandit troops. For these ignorant and coerced masses, it is too cruel to kill them, and it is endless to condone them. In order to prevent the embers from burning again and to eliminate the roots of bandits and Communists, the only way is to divide the areas that have suffered the longest and been the most deeply poisoned into special administrative regions, and strictly establish political organizations to fulfill the responsibility of supervision and management, and strengthen party affairs work to achieve the effect of training and transformation. After a considerable period of time, it can be restored to its original state. The outline for the establishment of special administrative regions is as follows:</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<h3>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>Left, (1) All areas that have been disturbed by bandits and Communists for more than one year shall be designated as special administrative regions. (2) The regulations and revocation of special administrative regions shall be ordered by the provincial governments of each province. (3) A special administrative region management committee shall be established as the highest administrative organ of the special administrative region, directly under the provincial government. (4) The number of members of the special administrative region management committee shall be determined by the provincial governments of each province on a temporary basis, taking into account the local conditions. However, in order to carefully organize this power organ, two-thirds of the members shall be proposed by the provincial government, one-third shall be proposed by the provincial party department, and one person shall be proposed by the higher court of each province and appointed by the provincial government. (5) All residents of the special administrative region shall have their civil rights suspended, except as otherwise ordered, but may be restored at any time with the permission of the special administrative region management committee. (6) All administration of the special administrative region shall not be subject to the constraints of ordinary laws, but shall be reported to the provincial government for approval and implementation at any time. Whether the above is appropriate,</p>
<p>I respectfully await your public decision.</p>
<h3>Proposal to Revise the Provincial Administrative Regions</h3>
<p>Commissioner Chen Mingshu proposed a proposal to revise the principles of provincial administrative regions (co-signed by ten commissioners including Hu Hanmin). The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Our country has a vast territory, and governance is difficult. The Republic of China was founded, and all undertakings were renewed, but the division of administrative regions still followed the old provincial system since the Yuan Dynasty. The malpractices are that the upper level cannot be governed by the central government, and the lower level cannot be solely responsible for the local government, and the situation of warlords occupying territory has become a desire to remedy its evils, mostly based on the view of inheritance, and advocated the theory of the joint provincial autonomy, which is to make the occupation of territory a theoretical basis, and to give the warlords institutional protection. Only the Premier saw through its crux, and advocated raising the status of the county, and the province was only established between the central government and the county, to collect its contact effect. The essence of the Premier's entire nation-building program, on the exercise of governance, lies in this. If we base on the Premier's遗教 and make practical facilities, then the provincial area must be re-revised. The current provincial area of our country, the size of one province is almost the same as one country, with the protection of the army, and the power to manipulate finance, it has become the foundation for the generation of warlords. If the provincial area is reduced, and the provincial power is reduced, then even if the warlords have the heart to occupy, there is no place to occupy. Also, if the provincial area is too large, the supervision of the county's self-government by the governor is not easy to be meticulous, the status of the county is too low, and the local administration is inconvenient due to multiple twists and turns, local administration cannot be measured and used in the construction of the county's self-government, if the provincial area is reduced, and the provincial power is reduced, then the self-government is easier to complete. The size of one province is almost the same as one country, then the talent to govern the province must be the talent to govern the country, the talent is concentrated in the central government and there is more than enough, and scattered to the provinces is not enough, so the central government and the provinces all feel the pain of the difficulty of talent, and the talent to govern the province is not enough, and used to govern the county, or there is more than enough, the provincial area is reduced, and the provincial power is reduced, then the talent who is superior to governing the province is concentrated in the central government, and the talent who is not enough to govern the province is scattered to the counties, and the talent is enough. As for the method of revising the provincial area, it is based on the old Dao area as the standard, the division of the old Dao area is mostly based on historical habits, the shape of mountains and rivers, and the size is moderate and convenient to adopt, but there are special circumstances such as the convenience of economic development, the adjustment of poor and rich areas, etc., which will be determined by the central government separately. As for the provincial use of the provincial governor system and the duties of the provincial governor, the Outline for Nation Building has a general provision, and the division of central finance and local finance is especially cautious. In this way, the government can avoid the disadvantages of a huge organization and stacking beds on the roof. At this time of suppressing the rebellion and achieving unification, the rapid completion of self-government, and the prevention of the re-emergence of warlords, the only important task is to earnestly implement the legacy shown by the Premier's Outline for Nation Building. I have listed the principles as far as I can see, and if they are adopted, please ask the Central Political Conference to detail the methods, and hand it over to the Legislative Yuan to formulate the New Provincial Law for implementation. Is it appropriate? Please make a public decision.</p>
<p>Principles (1) Revise the current provincial area, and use the old Dao area as the provincial area, but if there are special circumstances, it shall be determined separately by the central government. (2) A governor shall be established in the province, appointed by the central government, and at the beginning of the constitutional government period, the governor shall be elected by the National Assembly in accordance with the Outline for Nation Building. (3) Abolish the current Organizational Law of the Provincial Government, and separately formulate the Organizational Regulations of the Provincial Governor's Office. (4) The administrative expenses of the Provincial Governor's Office shall be paid by the central government. (5) The duties of the governor are to supervise the local self-government of the counties within the province, and the national administration within the province shall be subject to the command of the central government. (6) After the provincial system is formulated according to the above principles, the central and county tax revenue shall all follow the division of Article 11 of the Outline for Nation Building, and the county's burden on the central government shall be verified according to the circumstances of each county.</p>
<h3>Proposal to Amend the Regulations of the Political Conference</h3>
<p>Sun Ke proposed to amend the regulations of the Central Political Conference. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>(Reason) The Central Political Conference is the highest guiding organ for implementing political tutelage throughout the country. The matters stipulated to be discussed and resolved are the Outline for Nation Building, legislative principles, administrative policy, military grand strategy, financial plan, and the selection of various political officials, although it does not directly issue orders and handle political affairs, but it is actually the central hub of the national political movement, and it is precious to use it flexibly and command quickly, and then the political affairs can be promoted, and the effect of the body using the arm and the arm using the finger can be achieved. However, after observing the past years, there are important grand strategies concerning the administration of various departments that should be decided by the central government, but the Political Conference has not yet been involved. There are also major plans of various departments that have been submitted to the Political Conference through the Executive Yuan, but because the heads of the various departments are not central members, they cannot attend the meeting, so the various members cannot deeply understand the case, so they hastily decide or directly hand it over to the various groups to put it aside for a long time. After the case has been handed over to the group for review, the original proposing organ has no one to attend the explanation, and temporary invitations are often inconvenient, so even after review, it cannot be properly resolved, and it often happens. All of these have lost the original intention of the central government to use the Political Conference to promote politics, and must be remedied urgently. (Method) The way to remedy it is that the heads of all central departments and committees in the future, even if they are not central members, should also be allowed to attend the Political Conference, limited to the ministers and vice ministers of the various departments and the chairmen and vice chairmen of the various committees. In this way, the various barriers between the central government and the heads of the various departments and committees can be eliminated, and it will be easier to get a clue and quickly resolve the various matters under discussion. As for the various groups established under the Political Conference, the ministers of the various departments and the chairmen of the various committees can be made to participate in them, so as to jointly undertake the work of review and design of various items. The vice ministers or vice chairmen of the various departments can be made to concurrently serve as special secretaries of the various groups, and they must be more familiar with the ins and outs of the various cases than others, and it is convenient to handle them, easy to consult, and ask. This method is of great help to the politics of party transformation. The responsibility of our party is to use the power of the party to promote politics, which is certainly necessary. If you agree to the public decision, please submit the current regulations of the Central Political Conference for amendment, so as to facilitate movement and benefit progress. The party and the country are fortunate. Whether all the reasons and methods for amending the regulations of the Central Political Conference are feasible, I respectfully await your public decision.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek and his wife hosted a gathering at the Reinvigoration Society on the 14th evening. They invited all Central Committee members, ministers of various ministries, military officers, and foreign envoys and charges d'affaires and their wives, totaling over six hundred people. The event was bustling and very grand for a time.

<h3>Yang Hucheng Recommends Candidates for the Shaanxi Provincial Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) For the candidates of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee, Yang Hucheng recommended several people, including Hu Yimin and Li Zhigang, and requested the government to appoint them. He requested that the remaining positions be appointed by the National Government. Hu Yimin was originally recommended to concurrently serve as Provincial Committee member and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, but since Hu is Yang Hucheng's important representative in Beijing and needs to handle various matters, it is difficult for him to leave Beijing for the time being. In the future, Yang himself may concurrently hold the position. Li Zhigang will concurrently serve as Director of the Department of Finance. It is said that this will soon be submitted to the State Council. As for the three divisions under Yang's command – those of Ma Qingyuan, Feng Qinzai, and Sun Weiru – the Central Government currently allocates 250,000 yuan per month for military expenses. Once Shaanxi's financial situation recovers, the Shaanxi Provincial Government will guarantee the payments. The remnants of the Northwest Army within Shaanxi have been suppressed, but there are still small groups of bandits being cleared. (14th Dispatch)</p>

The remaining troops are still stationed in Xinxiang on the Daokou-Qinghua Railway. The organizational structure of the troops is still the old system, currently divided into four mixed brigades and two mixed cavalry brigades. They are waiting to receive the Central Government's organizational chart before reorganizing, and they will also request the Central Government to send personnel to inspect. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi Suddenly Attacked</h3>
<p>Bullet Hits Lower Abdomen, Not Yet Fatal</p>
<p>Assailant Sagoya Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>Condition Good After Surgery</p>
<p>Rumors of Binhara Assuming Temporary Regency</p>
<p>Motive for Assassination Allegedly Due to Economic Recession</p>
<p>▲Japanese Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th: Prime Minister Hamaguchi was shot in the abdomen by a strong man at Tokyo Station at 8:50 AM this morning while on his way to inspect the Okayama Army Grand Maneuvers. The assailant was arrested on the spot.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th: The assassination attempt on Prime Minister Hamaguchi occurred precisely when the special express train bound for the west was departing at 9:00 AM. There were many people seeing him off at the station. The newly appointed Ambassador to Moscow, Hirota, was also on the same train as the Prime Minister, so the station was very crowded. The sound of the gunshot was indistinguishable from the sound of cameras taking pictures, and even those nearby did not notice. Only when the Prime Minister fell to the ground did people realize what had happened and panic. The perpetrator, Sagoya Tomeo, was wearing a plain white cotton kimono, a dark blue pleated skirt, and wooden clogs. He approached the Prime Minister from the crowd of well-wishers and took out a concealed handgun to shoot him, causing great chaos at Tokyo Station.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th: After being shot, Hamaguchi immediately fainted. He was carried to the stationmaster's office and given emergency treatment. The bullet hit his thigh, but did not pass through completely. It stopped between his thigh and lower abdomen. The peritoneum and intestines were severely injured, and the Prime Minister seemed to be in considerable pain. Fortunately, he was still conscious and able to speak with Secretary Nakajima. Later, the bleeding increased, and he could not be moved. It is currently impossible to say whether his life is in danger. The assailant is being interrogated by Inspector Nakamura of the Hibiya Police Station. According to his confession, he is Sagoya Tomeo, 23 years old, from Nagasaki Prefecture, and is lodging at the home of Yoshikatsu Matsumoto. He wanted to assassinate the Prime Minister to restore the economic situation and had no accomplices. His motive for the crime and whether he has any connections are currently unknown.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu: Regarding Sagoya's military service status, the Nagasaki Prefecture Military Affairs Section announced that Sagoya underwent a conscription examination in Akasaka Ward, Tokyo, in the 3rd year of Showa (1928). Although he was a graduate of an ordinary elementary school, he was considered to have completed two years of middle school at the time of the examination. From this point of view, he seems to have studied hard to some extent. He is 5 feet 1.9 inches tall, weighs 59 kilograms, and was deemed fit for Category C service. According to the family register, the perpetrator is an illegitimate child from Oshima Village, Kitamatsuura County, Nagasaki Prefecture, born on December 1, Meiji 41 (1908). Because he could not enter his mother's family, he established his own family and registered on December 7 of that year. His mother, Isoko, became pregnant with Tomeo when she was a geisha in Sonogi Village in the 40th year of Meiji (1907), through an affair with a certain Mr. Tsuchikata. Tsuchikata later disappeared, and Tomeo was born.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Associated Press, the assailant who shot Prime Minister Hamaguchi, Sagoya Tomeo, was born in Gyeongseong (Seoul), Korea. His father runs a woodworking business in Sogane-cho, Gyeongseong, and has some wealth. Tomeo graduated from an elementary school in Gyeongseong and has always had a violent temperament and strong class consciousness. At the age of seventeen, he worked under Cheongi (bandit chieftain) in Manchuria. He returned to mainland Japan once in the 10th year of Taisho (1921) and then immediately returned to Manchuria to work as a bandit between Tanigawa and Cheongi. At the age of twenty, he returned to mainland Japan to Tokyo, and often frequented political and educational societies and national language societies. He became a member of the Patriotic Society this June. Although he does not drink alcohol, his nature is violent. He was charged with affray and assault on January 3rd of last year and August 15th of this year, and is currently still serving a three-month suspended sentence.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th: Party leaders and others rushed to Tokyo Station after receiving news of the Prime Minister's assassination. Because his condition was dangerous, all visits were prohibited. Afterwards, Dr. Hayashi, Dr. Shioda, and Dr. Kondo jointly consulted on the Prime Minister's wound and determined that he needed absolute rest and should be injected with Ringer's solution. At the same time, about 190 grams of blood were injected from the Prime Minister's second son, Iwane, which slightly restored his energy. After Dr. Shioda performed surgery at 1:15 PM, Dr. Shioda announced the procedure as follows: The bullet entered the abdomen 3 cm below the navel, passed through six places in the upper part of the jejunum, and after the mesentery of the descending colon, it entered the left buttocks from the abdominal wall. During the surgery, 50 cm of the jejunum was cut off, the blood that had overflowed into the abdominal cavity was removed, the peritoneum was cleaned, and an eggplant-induced method was performed. The surgery ended at 2:00 PM. During the surgery, the pulse was good, and the spirit was clear. He talked to people from time to time. Based on experience during the European War, patients with this type of injury can survive if they can last for more than ten hours.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu: Regarding the Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition and progress, either a temporary cabinet meeting will be held, or a temporary prime minister will be appointed. At that time, Foreign Minister Shidehara may concurrently serve as temporary prime minister.</p>

The authorities have declared martial law in several places. British and American expatriates are flocking here for refuge. There have been reports of violent armed clashes in some places, with at least twelve workers killed and twenty seriously injured. An American engineer was beheaded. It is also reported that another person was a worker, and several others were beheaded.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 14th: According to news from Havana, Cuba, six people have died and seventy-two have been injured in riots in the past seventy-two hours. Martial law has been declared in the city. Soldiers patrol the streets, and residents do not go out. All newspapers except the government gazette have suspended publication to protest censorship. In early October, the Senate approved President Machado's request to suspend constitutional guarantees in Havana and its four surrounding districts until the general election on November 1. Constitutional guarantees are the various freedoms of speech and assembly enjoyed by the people. Suspending this right is tantamount to declaring a disguised form of martial law.</p>

<h3>Latest Developments in the Longjing Village Case</h3>
<p>▲Reports of Japanese Police Retreating from Yanbian</p>
<p>Jilin News Agency: After the unfortunate incident in Longjing Village, Yanbian, on the 6th of last month due to Japanese police provocation, the Japanese side immediately seized the opportunity to deploy 106 armed Japanese police officers from the Korean border to Longbu, harassing various parts of Yanbian and doing whatever they pleased. The people of Yanbian repeatedly appealed to all parties and held a citizens' meeting to urge the Japanese side to realize their wrongdoing. The Jilin Provincial Government, considering the matter to be related to international relations, reported to Liaoning, which telegraphed the central government to protest to the Japanese ambassador. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also engaged in serious negotiations with Acting Ambassador Shigemitsu, but received no reply, and the situation in Yanbian became increasingly serious. Therefore, it ordered local officials to negotiate on the spot. Subsequently, Zhang Shuhan, the head of the Yanji Municipal Preparatory Office and in charge of negotiations, and Okada, the Japanese Consul-General of Jiandao, held several rounds of talks. The Japanese side was initially very tough, and at the same time made representations to Chairman Zhang in Liaoning, demanding compensation, punishment of the perpetrators, apology, and guarantees. After our side replied that the Japanese police must first be withdrawn before considering accommodating them within a possible scope, the Japanese side also showed some concession. Therefore, on the morning of the 5th of this month, all the above-mentioned Japanese police officers were withdrawn to Korea, and negotiations continued with us in order to reach a quick resolution. Currently, it is in progress. It is reported that the Japanese side initially proposed 40,000 yuan for the pensions of the two Japanese police officers killed and some medical expenses for the injured Japanese police officer, but it has now been reduced to 10,000 yuan. Both sides have also made concessions on other conditions, but the details are kept secret by the authorities and will probably only be announced after everything is completed. (November 8th)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Jiangxi Province Collapsing and Retreating in Different Directions</h3>
<p>▲Fang and Shao's Gang Flee to the Anhui Border ▲Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang Flee to Eastern Jiangxi</p>
<p>▲Anhui Province to Join the Suppression ▲Jiangxi Army Pursues Towards Fuzhou</p>
<p>Nanchang News Agency: The three provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei have already launched a large-scale campaign to suppress the Communist bandits. Recently, Anhui has also joined, changing it to a four-province joint suppression, which is still commanded by He Chengjun as the Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression of Bandits in the Four Provinces. The reason is that the Communist gangs of Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping have been harassing the northeast of Jiangxi and the border areas of Anhui and Hubei, such as Wuyuan and Susong, so Anhui Province has joined the suppression in order to eliminate them. According to reports, the Communist leader Fang Zhimin in eastern Jiangxi recently attempted to purchase firearms from a foreign merchant ship on Pengze Lake in northern Jiangxi, but was defeated by the naval fleet at Hukou and retreated to eastern Jiangxi. Currently, most of Fang's bandits are still entrenched in the towns of Dexing, Jingzhen, Leping, and the countryside of Raozhou and Duchang, propagating communism. The people of each village have fled, and the county magistrates and representatives of each county in eastern Jiangxi, such as Jiang Bozhang, have separately requested Chairman Lu in Nanxun and Hu Zuyu to send troops to suppress them. In addition to telegraphing the Chairman of Anhui to send Yue Shengxuan's troops to the Jiangxi border as soon as possible, Lu also ordered Hu Zuyu to advance from northern Jiangxi to eastern Jiangxi to implement a joint suppression. It is reported that Yue's troops have already set out from Wuyuan to the Dexing area, and Hu's troops have also ordered the 28th and 29th Regiments to advance from Pengze Lake to Jingzhen and Duchang.</p>
<p>As for the gangs of Peng, Huang, Zhu, and Mao, their main force, the so-called 1st, 3rd, 5th, 8th, 12th, and 20th Pseudo-Armies, originally gathered in Xinyu, Fenyi, Qingjiang south of the Yuan River, and Anfu, Xiajiang, Jishui, Ji'an, and Xingan west of the Gan River. They claimed to have 100,000 men, but only had 20,000 to 30,000 rifles. Each rifle had less than two rows of bullets. The rest were a rabble of peasant bandits, either unarmed or with spears. Lu Dipin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Nine Route Armies, had already ordered the 18th, 50th, 20th, New 13th, and 77th Divisions to advance fiercely towards Qingjiang and Xinyu. As soon as the general offensive order was issued, the four counties of Qingjiang, Xingan, Xinyu, and Fenyi were recovered. Most of Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang crossed the Gan River from Xiajiang, passed through Yongfeng and Le'an, and fled to Fuzhou. According to news from Fuzhou, Chongren has already fallen, and Linchuan is also very critical. On the 10th, the city gates were tightly closed and a special curfew was imposed. The boats gathered west of the Fu River were all hoisted to the eastern bank of Xijingdu to cut off traffic. Many people have fled to the province from Fuzhou in the past two days, and there are rumors that Fuzhou is difficult to defend. However, since the day before yesterday, the 1st and 5th Aviation Squadrons have been departing for Chongren in the rain to bomb the bandits. According to report No. 53 of Kesa, Communist bandits were discovered near Chong City on the 11th, and six 120-pound bombs were dropped, all of which exploded, killing many bandits. Recently, Mao Bingwen's troops, which had been concentrated in the provincial capital, also advanced towards Fuzhou at full speed. At the same time, the Zhang and Tan troops in Fengcheng and Qingjiang are closely pursuing the bandits from the east of the Gan River towards Chongren and Le'an, and will join forces with Deng Ying's division in Fuzhou to attack them from both sides. Therefore, the Communist bandits will likely flee from Guangchang to the Fujian border.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Lu immediately issued a commendation order to the Zhang and Luo divisions for recapturing the four counties of Xinyu, etc., and also telegraphed the commanders of each column to advance at full speed. The situation of Luo's division recapturing Fenyi has been reported to the province, with the text saying, "This morning, our Yi Brigade led its troops from Fengyang Bridge to suppress the Communist bandits occupying Jieqiao and Fenyi. The bandits in Jieqiao immediately fled to the southeast. The main force in Fenyi did not know that our army was advancing rapidly. When our main force arrived at the city, they began to resist. After about two hours of street fighting, our Hu Brigade joined in from the right wing, and the bandit troops could not resist, and fled in panic to the south bank of the Yuan River. In this battle, about 200 bandits were killed, and more than 400 bandits were captured alive, including a commander, Wei. Two puppet regimental commanders, Li Shucai and Li Jufeng, and the Chairman of the Soviet, Qiu Weidao, were drowned. We captured more than 200 rifles, spears, flags, and baggage, and Pseudo-Army Commander Huang Gonglue and Pseudo-Division Commander Long Zidao are on the run. More than ten members of our troops were injured. Details will be reported later. Sincerely, Luo Lin." (November 12th)</p>
<h3>Han Fuju Summoned to Beijing</h3>
<p>Jinan News Agency: Provincial Chairman Han Fuju received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang this morning (12th) ordering him to go to Beijing. Han immediately ordered the adjutant's office to prepare a car and set off for Beijing at 3:00 PM today. At 11:00 AM, Han convened a meeting of the heads of various departments in the provincial government to discuss military and political affairs in the province and decided that Li Zongbi, the chief of staff of the First Army Corps, would handle military affairs on his behalf, and Li Shuchun, the head of the Department of Civil Affairs, would handle political affairs on his behalf. In case of important matters, he would still telegraph for instructions at any time. After the arrangements were completed, Han left the provincial government for the station at 2:40 PM. Those who came to the station to see him off included Cao Fulin, the commander of the 14th Army, Xu Wenyao, the deputy commander, and the heads of various departments. At 2:50 PM, the train departed south. The entourage included Zhang Yue, a member of the Provincial Committee, and more than ten others. Li Jinglin, the director of the Central Guoshu (martial arts) Academy, also went to Beijing on the same train. It is reported that Han's mission is related to the aftermath of the Northwest Army and the defense area of Sun Lianzhong's troops. Chairman Chiang summoned him to Beijing because Han is a veteran of the Northwest Army and is more familiar with the situation, and wanted to consult him. He will return to Shandong within three to five days. (November 12th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Re-discussion of Winter Rent Quality and Reduction: The quality of this year's rent collection has been previously agreed upon by various public groups at 85%. Now, the county political meeting considers that the autumn harvest this year is the best in decades, with a maximum yield of three dan of rice per mu. When the supply of new grain ran out this year, the price of rice was 20 yuan per dan, which was also the highest in decades. It is considered excessive to collect three dan of rice per mu as a standard. In order to determine a moderate method, it has been decided that the rent collection quality for 1919 will be uniformly 81%, that is, 1.9 dou of rice will be exempted for every one dan of regular rent. The county government will reply to the county party headquarters in a letter, seek consent, and then announce its implementation. It is reported that the San Shan Tang rent collection office will also automatically reduce the rent and is said to be collecting at 80%.</p>

Yesterday (13th) at around 9:00 AM, Dai's other mistress, Ms. Zhou, came to Suzhou from Shanghai to shop in Guanqian, intending to return to her mother's home in Changshu. Unexpectedly, after arriving at Guanqian, she met Dai and Ms. Bian. Dai immediately spoke with Ms. Zhou, but Ms. Bian became jealous and made things difficult for Ms. Zhou, leading to a clash.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Service is Suspended: The southern section of the Xicheng Highway within the territory of this county has been open to traffic since August. However, due to poor construction and soft ground, the car tire tracks are deeply embedded by more than a foot, making it difficult for rickshaws to operate near Yanqiao, and there is a risk of the car overturning. Recently, Director of the Construction Bureau Yao Dixun saw this situation and borrowed a road roller from the Changshu Construction Bureau to compact the road firmly. Therefore, the long-distance bus service on this section will be suspended for two weeks to carry out repairs.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Overseas Chinese Schools in Southeast Asia to Use Domestic Textbooks and Teaching Materials</h3>
<p>▲Investigating Restrictions by Local Governments</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education instructed consuls in British and Dutch territories in Southeast Asia to investigate the restrictions imposed by local governments on the use of books in overseas Chinese schools. The original order stated, "The colonial governments of British and Dutch territories in Southeast Asia often impose unreasonable restrictions on textbooks and teaching materials used in overseas Chinese schools. Recently, it has been heard that these governments are even compiling, printing, and distributing textbooks themselves, and forcing overseas Chinese schools to adopt them. Their intention is nothing more than to anesthetize and weaken our youth and our overseas Chinese so that they can be driven and humiliated and become obedient subjects of imperialism without realizing it. Their intentions are extremely insidious. However, the methods used by these governments to restrict textbooks and the contents of the textbooks they compile should be collected and studied to serve as a basis for negotiations. Please collect this information from nearby locations and send it to the Ministry quickly for verification. Also, please inform the overseas Chinese schools under your jurisdiction to freely adopt the textbooks and teaching materials approved by the Ministry and reject the textbooks compiled and printed by these governments. This is extremely important." This order.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Liaoning Province to Investigate Manchurian Textbooks</h3>

Their compilation methods are also different from the textbooks commonly used in Japan. The Ministry now intends to collect these textbooks in order to study them in detail, prevent the Japanese conspiracy of aggression, and provide reference for compiling Southeast Asian readers. The Education Department should find ways to obtain a complete set of these textbooks as easily as possible and send them to the Ministry quickly.</p>

<h3>Municipal Propaganda Meeting's Declaration on the Issue of the President of China Public School</h3>
<p>▲ Admonishing Hu Shi Not to Become a Public Enemy ▲ Urging Mr. Yu to Assume His Post at the School Soon ▲ Encouraging Students to Cultivate Their Talents for the Nation</p>
<p>(National News Agency) The Municipal Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Committee convened a municipal propaganda meeting, which extensively discussed the student unrest at Wusong China Public School. Unwilling to see a matter nearing resolution repeatedly embroiled in disputes, the committee issued a serious declaration to advise all parties involved. The original text of the declaration is as follows: Our country has suffered the bullying and oppression of international capitalist imperialism for over a hundred years, and the infighting and mutual destruction of domestic feudal warlords for over a decade. The people are impoverished, and the nation is weakened. Everyone knows this, and there is no need to elaborate. Our Party's founder, Sun Yat-sen, recognizing the urgency of the domestic and international situation, raised his arms and called for revolution. With the help of virtuous and ambitious individuals, and the support of the masses, the tyrannical Qing dynasty was overthrown, and the brilliant Republic of China was established. However, as the light of dawn had just appeared, the flames of rebellion reignited. The civil wars of the Republic of China for more than a decade have unfortunately reappeared on the political stage in China. What have our people done to deserve such hardship? The national father, who was troubled by this throughout his life, eventually died, exhausted, in Beiping, departing from the Republic of China he had founded. But the national father has passed away, what will become of our people? Comrades of our Party, mourning the unfulfilled aspirations of the Premier and the plight of the people, are striving in accordance with the Premier's last wishes, sacrificing their blood and lives. In less than two years, the country was pacified. However, the misfortunes of the Republic of China have not ended, and rebellious warlords have risen again. A group of frustrated politicians and literary demons have also taken advantage of the opportunity to stir up trouble. Thus, the battlefields are filled with counter-revolutionary troops, and the hallowed halls of academia have become platforms for reactionary rhetoric. The heinous gang of Yan, Feng, and Wang has been completely eliminated, thanks to the spirit of the Premier in heaven and the courageous efforts of the soldiers at the front. However, the arrogance of the reactionary literary demons continues unabated, as can be seen in the student unrest at China Public School. The establishment of China Public School has a long history, and the student body is substantial. The painstaking efforts of the founders are recognized by people both in China and abroad. Since Hu Shi, who had fallen into decline, took over the school, driven by his unfulfilled ambition, he edited the "New Crescent" magazine, making outrageous statements, slandering the Premier, criticizing doctrines, and vilifying the central government. He spared no effort in using words that incite people's hearts and theories that harm the Party and the nation. However, not everyone in the world can be fooled. Hu Shi was eventually rejected by society and dismissed from his position. However, the reactionary faction's toxic intent to use universities to numb the youth has not diminished. Therefore, Ma Junwu succeeded him as the president of the school. Ma Junwu is a well-known eccentric scholar. This time, in order to consolidate his position, he did not hesitate to collude with communists, nationalists, and others to act as his cheerleaders, and even attempted to use a small number of students to control the organization of the entire student body and manipulate the will of all the students. Thus, the strange drama of beating Li occurred. Therefore, it is considered shocking by some that Ma Junwu's reactionary actions and oppression of his colleagues, but for Ma himself, it was a necessary course of action. However, justice still prevails and people rose up to correct this. Therefore, Ma Junwu has also followed in Hu Shi's footsteps and will be rejected by society. It is reported that the school board has approved his resignation. The school board is deeply concerned about China Public School and saddened by the repeated student unrest. Therefore, they urged Yu Youren, a senior member of the Party and the nation, to take on this difficult task. Anyone with a conscience should sincerely repent and welcome him. However, Hu Shi, whose cunning scheme has not been successful and whose ambition has not been realized, took advantage of Mr. Yu's attendance at the Fourth Plenary Session to unscrupulously sabotage the resolution of the school board. He repeatedly incited a small number of students to re-ignite the pro-Ma wave, personally went to the school, and tried every means to clarify the path to victory in the student unrest. He then established a disciplinary squad to coerce the organization and forcibly rape the will of the entire student body. His intentions are insidious, and his actions are ruthless. Anyone with a little bit of passion and love for the Party and the nation would want to bring Hu Shi to justice. However, the past is gone, and the future can be pursued. For the present, in addition to sincerely advising Hu Shi not to become a public enemy and leave his motherland with no place to call home, we also hope that Mr. Yu will assume his post as soon as possible and preside over everything. The pure youths will be further inspired by Mr. Yu, and the youths who have been numbed will also be guided by Mr. Yu and turn back. At this time when military operations have ended, and political tutelage has begun, the construction of the nation depends on the many students of our country's highest institutions of learning. All of our youths should know that at this time of national crisis, there is a great need for talented people. They should bury themselves in their studies and cultivate their talents for the nation. This is not only the earnest hope of this meeting. This declaration is hereby made.</p>

<h3>Municipal Training Department Prepares for Middle and Elementary School Party Principles Essay and Speech Competition</h3>
<p>(National News Agency) The Municipal Training Department of the City Party Committee is preparing to hold a city-wide essay and speech competition on Party principles for middle and elementary school students, as briefly reported yesterday. It is now known that the regulations have been sent to various schools. According to the regulations, only municipal and registered private schools are eligible to participate. Middle schools are limited to the essay competition, while elementary schools will participate in the speech competition. It is reported that this restriction is to prevent too many schools from participating, which would make it difficult to hold the competition. It may also be for the purpose of phasing the competition. As the elementary school speech competition is based on schools as units, the winning schools will receive group awards in addition to individual awards.</p>
<h3>Chairman and Professors of the Agricultural College of Labor University Reply to Li Lianggong</h3>
<p>A letter from the Chairman and Professors of the Agricultural College of Labor University to President Li Lianggong reads: "President Lianggong, Greetings. In recent days, newspapers have been filled with students' 'declarations' and 'warnings,' lengthy articles that specifically attack Mr. Fang Cheng, Mr. Wu Shuge, and Mr. Chen Guorong. This tactic of divide and conquer has been your sole weapon in dealing with your colleagues for the past month. We know that your intention is to expand the student unrest in order to overthrow the school affairs committee, hoping to become acting president, and then to change from acting to official president to achieve your grand goal. Yesterday, we read your letter to the faculty and staff of the Agricultural College. Everything that was in the students' declaration was also present in your letter, as if you were confessing that you were the mastermind behind this student unrest. You revealed the truth yourself, and now the truth is clear to the world. In the past, we did not hesitate to advance or retreat for personal reasons, and we did not dare to speak frankly in order to seek social judgment. However, at a time when our school is in turmoil, it cannot withstand further damage. Therefore, we have tried our best to tolerate and avoid disputes with students. We also know that once the academic atmosphere of the school is destroyed by careerists, it will be difficult for those who come later to clean up. Therefore, we are especially unwilling to use our pens to create a situation of multiple litigations, which would give you an opportunity to take advantage of. Now that you have bothered to fill the paper with slander, how can we not refute it? (1) You said that there are three major points of contention at this school. The first is that the entire student body opposes the school affairs committee and tricked Mr. Peng Xiang and Mr. Cheng Ganyun into leaving. The second is that the students of the Chemistry Department oppose Mr. Fang Cheng and Mr. Wu Shuge. The third is that the students of the Horticulture Department oppose Mr. Chen Guorong. Regarding the first point, we will leave it to the colleagues of the school affairs committee and Mr. Peng and Mr. Cheng to answer, and we will not waste words. However, the school affairs committee was originally something you wanted to control and manipulate. Now that you want to overthrow it, isn't that strange? Before the third meeting of the school affairs committee, you sent a telegram to prevent all the professor representatives from the Agricultural College from attending, hoping to cause a quorum to fail. Before the fourth meeting of the school affairs committee, at midnight, you knocked on Mr. Fang Cheng's door and told him, 'Tomorrow, we will propose a motion to impeach the temporary administrative committee and a motion to approve the appointment of the president. Our Agricultural College representatives have nine votes. Combined with Xiong Zirong and Zhang Ba's votes, we only have eleven votes. If we can sway three people to remain neutral, we can win.' On the day of the meeting, Mr. Fang Cheng was unable to attend due to other business. You then brazenly appointed Mr. Zhu Tongjiu to serve as a representative. All of these are facts of your conspiracy to manipulate the school affairs committee. Even if you are as good at disguise as you are, you may not have a word to say. After the remote meeting was opened, the Agricultural College representatives were deeply disgusted by your base methods, completely treating the professor representatives as personal tools. Furthermore, because this meeting was very important to the future of the school, the majority opposed your proposal. From then on, you regarded the school affairs committee as a thorn in your side, and you had to remove it before you could be happy. You immediately changed your battle plan and actively incited student unrest. Furthermore, because of the failure at this meeting, due to the refusal of the Agricultural College representatives to agree with your personal plans, the Horticulture Department students suddenly attacked Mr. Chen the day after the meeting, and the Chemistry Department students suddenly attacked Mr. Fang and Mr. Wu. Mr. Chen, Mr. Fang, and Mr. Wu are not present as representatives of the school, and you believe that in order to shoot someone, you must shoot the horse first. (To be continued)"</p>

The event lasted from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, and the judges calculated the scores and presented the awards. The atmosphere was joyous. The details are recorded as follows: ▲ Group Gymnastics Yesterday's group gymnastics performance consisted of thirty-eight sections. Among them, the folk dances of Wuben and Shangwen, the national martial arts of Tonghui, the short-range boxing of Shihua, and the peace dance of the Qunxuehui Kindergarten students were the most outstanding. The national martial arts performance of 200-300 students from Yangzheng School was particularly commendable for its coordinated movements and energetic spirit.</p>
<p>▲ Track and Field The rules of this competition were based on the rules of the previous Far Eastern Games. As the rules of the current Far Eastern Games were published recently, the elementary school students were not yet familiar with them. Therefore, the judging panel decided to adopt the previous rules. In the track and field events, similar results were not re-evaluated. The results are listed as follows:</p>

<p>After the scores were calculated at 4:30 PM, the awards ceremony was held immediately. The Party song was sung, and the ceremony was performed. After respectfully reading the will, Chairman Xu (Director of the Education Bureau) delivered the closing speech. Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government, representing the Mayor, delivered a speech, and then Mrs. Yu presented the awards separately. The winning children were filled with joy, and the onlookers applauded and cheered. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>▲ Director Xu's Closing Speech</h3>
<p>Director Xu said, "Today is the closing day of the third joint sports meet of municipal elementary schools. I hope that the sports performance of each elementary school will be better year after year, and the physical condition will be better year after year, as I said at the opening ceremony. Now, the results have been compiled, and most of the records are higher than last year. This is not only an honor for the schools, but also closely related to the municipal government, this bureau, and the entire society of Shanghai. If various results are declining instead of improving, what is the effect of the year's physical training of the city's elementary schools? How regrettable! Therefore, my first hope is that the physical education of municipal elementary schools will progress every year, breaking the records of the second time in the third time, and breaking the records of the third time in the fourth time, forever progressing. My second hope is that all of you children will get the foundation of physical training in your childhood, and continue to do so. As you grow older, your sports performance will also improve. The physical education of Japan is because they pay attention to it step by step from childhood, so they can dominate the Far East and occupy a considerable position in the world sports games. The result of our country's representatives in the Far Eastern Games is like this. If we participate in the World Sports Games, we can imagine what will happen. This is truly a great shame. Shanghai is a culturally developed area, and it should show something in sports. I hope that the current elementary school students will train hard and compete in the Far Eastern Games and the World Sports Games in a few years to come, and bring glory to the Republic of China. Finally, I would like to thank all sectors of society for their numerous awards, and I am deeply grateful for their sincerity in promoting sports. I would also like to sincerely thank the judges, the Boy Scout band, and the ambulance team for their hard work for three consecutive days to achieve this successful result."</p>
<h3>▲ Mayor's Representative's Speech</h3>
<p>Secretary-General Yu said, "Today is the closing of the Municipal Elementary School Joint Sports Meet, and I am deeply honored to participate in the awards ceremony on behalf of the Mayor. In recent days, my colleagues in the Municipal Government have paid close attention to the Municipal Elementary School Joint Sports Meet. Seeing the excellent results reported in the newspapers, we are deeply pleased. This is a testament to the efforts of the principals and teachers in their daily training. Today's awards to the children are proof of their attention to exercise and their excellent results. I hope that those who win the awards will continue to practice and strive for perfection, and that those who do not win the awards will also be guided by the principles of peace and struggle, work harder, and strive for victory in the future."</p>

<h3>British Aviatrix Miss [Sheila] Scott Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Flew from Xiamen to Shanghai in Eight Hours ▲Will Continue to Japan Tomorrow</p>
<p>The first female long-distance pilot to arrive in Shanghai, British aviator Miss [Sheila] Scott, flew her single-engine plane, undertaking the long-distance flight from London to Tokyo, and arrived safely at Hongqiao Airport yesterday at 2 PM. If the weather is favorable, she plans to fly to Hiroshima, Japan, tomorrow morning, before continuing to Tokyo. Miss [Sheila] Scott is currently staying at the residence of the British Consul-General, [John] Brenan.</p>
<p>▲Grand Welcome. Miss [Sheila] Scott flew from Hong Kong to Xiamen this past Wednesday. Yesterday morning at 6 AM, she flew from Xiamen to Shanghai. The foreign community in Shanghai prepared a welcome, expecting Miss [Sheila] Scott to arrive at noon. The British Consul-General's representative, [G.] Brander, the Shanghai Women's Association, and representatives of the Royal Aero Club of Great Britain, numbering about a hundred people, gathered at Hongqiao Airport, waiting until 1 PM, but Miss [Sheila] Scott's plane had not yet appeared. There were reports that Miss [Sheila] Scott had landed in Hangzhou. The British Consul-General's representative, [G.] Brander, discussed with the airplane factory director, Shen Dexie, who then personally flew a red military aircraft to scout the sky and welcome her from the direction of Hangzhou.</p>
<p>▲Sudden Arrival. Just as the welcoming ladies were eagerly anticipating her arrival, Miss [Sheila] Scott's small silver-gray plane suddenly appeared in the sky at 1:58 PM. The welcoming ladies, upon seeing it, rushed into the airport. Miss [Sheila] Scott flew around once in the air, then landed safely at 2 PM amidst applause and cheers. The crowd immediately surrounded her and dozens of cameras competed to take photographs. Miss [Sheila] Scott, of petite stature, wearing a flight suit, shook hands and spoke with the welcomers, her face beaming with smiles.</p>
<h3>Miss [Sheila] Scott Arrives in Shanghai for Photography</h3>
<p>Although she looked slightly weary from the eight-hour flight in the air yesterday, her spirits were still quite lively. The entire plane was covered with well wishes from people from the places she had traveled through. After a while, the plane that had gone to greet her returned. British Consul [G.] Brander then introduced Miss [Sheila] Scott to factory director Shen and expressed his gratitude for the welcome. Consul [G.] Brander then escorted Miss [Sheila] Scott to the British Consulate. After Miss [Sheila] Scott landed, Public Security Bureau representative Qu Xunyi and airplane factory representative Zhu Jiaren, in addition to expressing their welcome, originally intended to inspect Miss [Sheila] Scott's plane according to regulations, but considering Miss [Sheila] Scott's fatigue, they postponed it.</p>
<p>▲Flying East Tomorrow. Miss [Sheila] Scott departed from London alone on September 25, originally planning to fly to Tokyo in fifteen days. However, after flying through Europe, she encountered difficulties and had to make an emergency landing in the Persian Gulf, where she was held captive by Arabs. Miss [Sheila] Scott entertained the Arabs with song and dance to avoid danger. After flying to Hong Kong, she fell from a horse with the Governor of Hong Kong and was injured. Flying from Hong Kong to Xiamen, she had another close call when a leak developed in her plane's fuel tank. Fortunately, she landed safely in Xiamen. The wing was slightly damaged and, after minor repairs, she flew to Shanghai yesterday morning at 6 AM. The nearly two thousand-mile flight from Xiamen to Shanghai was one of the most difficult legs of her entire journey. After eight hours of flight, she finally arrived safely in Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, Miss [Sheila] Scott told this newspaper's reporter that the weather was clear when she departed from Xiamen, but she soon encountered headwinds and dense fog, making it impossible to discern her direction. She was forced to fly along the coast, causing her to arrive in Shanghai later than expected. She now plans to leave Shanghai on Sunday morning and fly east, first to Hiroshima, then to Tokyo. If the route proves too difficult, she will first fly to Korea before proceeding to Tokyo.</p>
<h3>Internal and External Debt Consolidation Conference Opens in Beijing Today</h3>
<p>▲Dutch and Italian Consuls Arrive in Beijing Last Night</p>
<p>Rumors that the Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee would meet in Shanghai on the 14th are completely inaccurate. According to reliable sources, most of the representatives and committee members of the Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee are in Beijing attending the Fourth Plenary Session, so the conference is scheduled to open in Beijing today. The first step will be to discuss consolidation methods, and then representatives of the creditor nations will be invited to attend and discuss everything in detail within the scope of the established methods. It is also reported that Dutch Consul Gronman and Italian Consul Ciano, along with the manager of the Sino-Italian Bank, Tavernier, arrived in Beijing last night at 11 PM and will represent the Dutch and Italian governments at the Internal and External Debt Consolidation Conference.</p>
<h3>Various Customs Inspection Vessels</h3>
<p>▲Recapture of the Right to Appoint Ship Inspectors ▲Increase in Inspection Vessel Fees</p>
<p>The Shanghai shipping industry's request to recapture the right to appoint ship inspectors for the Jianghai Customs has been underway. Now, the Customs has announced an increase in inspection vessel fees. The various rumors heard are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Expiration of the Englishman's Contract. The ship inspector for the Jianghai Customs is an Englishman named McNy, whose contract is for thirty-five years. There are also four English assistants. All Chinese and foreign merchant ships must be inspected by them once a year. The seaworthiness of the ship is stated in the inspector's certificate. After a ship has been inspected, the shipowner's responsibility in terms of navigation is greatly reduced. In the event of an accident, it can be attributed to circumstances beyond human control, so that the insurance company does not resist payment. Now, the Englishman's thirty-five-year contract will expire next spring. The Shanghai shipping industry is therefore striving to have a Chinese person appointed as his successor.</p>
<p>▲Ministry of Communications Has Agreed to Issue Certificates. There are quite a few Chinese who have experience in ship inspection and are capable of holding this position. At present, the Shanghai shipping industry has nominated six people, but there are still some discrepancies in the procedures regarding the certificates. The Shanghai shipping industry has submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to draft and issue regulations for the issuance and registration of ship inspector certificates so that Chinese people can apply for them and serve in this capacity in various customs offices. The Ministry of Communications has approved the request of the Shanghai shipping industry to draft these regulations, which will be submitted to the National Government for promulgation after the draft is completed. This should be implemented soon. ▲Customs Increases Inspection Vessel Fees. The Shanghai Jianghai Customs has announced an increase in inspection vessel fees and has notified the shipping companies to comply. The new and old rates are listed below (the table uses Customs registered tonnage as the unit of measure, the new price is the original rate plus the increase, and the unit is taels):</p>
<p>Tonnage / New Price / Original Rate / Increase</p>
<p>Within 50 tons / 30 / 20 / 10</p>
<p>50 to 75 tons / 40 / 30 / 10</p>
<p>76 to 100 tons / 60 / 40 / 20</p>
<p>101 to 150 tons / 75 / 50 / 25</p>
<p>151 to 250 tons / 100 / 75 / 25</p>
<p>251 to 500 tons / 125 / 100 / 25</p>
<p>501 to 1000 tons / 150 / 125 / 25</p>
<p>1001 to 200 tons / 200 / 125 / 75</p>
<p>201 to 2000 tons / 250 / 125 / 125</p>
<p>Over 2000 tons / 300 / 125 / 175</p>
<h3>The Prerequisite for Regulating People's Food Supply</h3>
<p>▲Planning and Building Perfect Rice Warehouses</p>
<p>The 20th regular meeting of the Municipal Food Committee was held today at the Social Affairs Bureau. Feng Liutang, chairman of the committee, proposed that the construction of rice warehouses should be the first step in regulating the people's food supply and restoring warehousing. The original text reads: "The system of famine relief is found in the Zhou Dynasty's 'Ever-Normal Granary' theory, which originated in the Warring States period. From the Han Dynasty through the Sui Dynasty to the Song Dynasty, the three-warehouse system was fully established, but it was constantly rising and falling. By the Qing Dynasty, money was accumulated instead of grain, so when famine suddenly occurred, there was no preparation. The original intention of accumulating money must have been to learn from the drawbacks of accumulating grain or to consider other uses (such as the Green Sprouts Policy). In fact, the system of accumulating grain is not bad, but it is due to the badness of people and the badness of politics. If people are bad and politics are bad, even if there is a good system, it cannot be implemented. For example, the social granaries were good when Zhu Xi implemented them, but later generations saw their drawbacks. This is what should be emphasized in both governing people and governing laws. Now, after years of frequent famine, everyone knows the necessity of restoring warehousing. The municipal warehousing fund is already being planned and raised. How the fundraising will succeed cannot be predicted, but it will definitely be able to raise some money. Its use should be waited for after the funds are in place, but what can be said is that accumulating grain is better than accumulating money, because accumulating grain can achieve an ever-normal granary, can achieve price stabilization, and can also provide disaster relief. The local situation can be considered (such as the difference between Shanghai and the interior, and even within Shanghai, the necessity of handling the urban area and the rural area separately), as well as the degree of famine. If money is accumulated, it must be raised at the time of the event, which easily misses the opportunity, and the handling is cumbersome, and the losses are more extensive. This can be verified by recent events. Whether it is accumulating grain or accumulating money, warehouses are needed. In the past, the construction of rice warehouses in our country can be seen in Zhang Zhaorui's 'Fixed Granary Foundation Style'. The planning was never not thorough, but it still could not be completed. Birds eat and insects bore because the architecture is not modern and complete. For example, Shanghai rice merchants have not stockpiled as much rice in recent years as in the past, which is certainly due to the high cost of warehouse rent and land prices. However, the construction of warehouses was originally intended for the storage of general commercial goods, and it is not suitable to store rice in them. Moreover, there are no suitable warehouses that can be used for storing rice. In the event of continuous rainy days, the rice will not be sufficient, and the rice price will immediately rise. The citizens of Shanghai have lived in this unstable life for a long time. If there were perfect rice warehouses, how could it be to this extent? Recently, it has been seen that the old coarse rice imported from Japan is oily and shiny, just like new rice. If our country's rice is stored for one year, it will be covered with insects and ash. After two or three years, it will turn into dust. Therefore, without the construction of perfect rice warehouses, there is no grain to store, and storage will cause a lot of loss. It can be seen from this that regulating grain and maintaining the people's food supply depends on having storage, and storage requires the construction of perfect rice warehouses. Now, when this city is preparing to restore warehousing, I propose that rice warehouses be built first when the fundraising for the fund is successful, and the following methods are attached: (1) Collect drawings of perfect rice warehouses, or send personnel to foreign countries to conduct on-site investigations of the architectural style of rice warehouses and their management methods. (2) Allocate several tens of thousands of yuan from the warehousing fund to serve as a construction fund (the amount must be determined by construction engineers). (3) Request the Municipal Government to allocate public land on the Pujiang coast, and the location should be selected where large ships can berth. If there is no public land, then encircle and purchase private land. (4) When building rice warehouses, the wharves and their lifting and unloading equipment must be built together. (5) Rice warehouses should be divided into several parts, so that when the public sector has surplus storage, it can be transferred to merchants for storage. Is the above method feasible? I hope for a public decision."</p>

<h3>Taxpayers Association Actively Inspects the Water Company's Accounts</h3>
<p>▲Yu Xiji and Others Continued Their Inspection Yesterday</p>
<p>The issue of the water price increase in the Public Concession has not been completely resolved, but the water company suddenly adopted a tough stance and distributed notices ordering payment, causing great resentment among the citizens. However, the Chinese Taxpayers Association still adheres to its original position that a price increase cannot be unreasonably imposed until the accounts have been inspected and the business situation is thoroughly understood. Therefore, it has notified all citizens to pay attention and has asked the accounting committee to actively conduct the audit in order to end it as soon as possible. Yesterday afternoon, audit committee member Yu Xiji came to Shanghai from Beijing and, together with committee member He Dequi and others, continued to go to the company to audit the accounts. In the evening, they returned to the association to sort out everything.</p>
<h3>Japanese Official Negotiates Telecommunications Case</h3>
<p>Due to the satisfactory negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese members of the Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations, a draft agreement on the Shanghai-Nagasaki line will be signed soon. In order to convey his intentions, the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Treaty Bureau official, Hanawa Yoshitaka, was specially dispatched to Shanghai to convey his opinions. Mr. Hanawa arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the Changchun Maru and is currently staying in Shanghai waiting for the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires to handle everything.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Federation Revokes Ministry of Foreign Affairs Passport Law</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from overseas Chinese groups denouncing the various abuses of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' privately enacted Provisional Passport Law. Yesterday, Feng Hanyue and Qi Gongheng were publicly elected as representatives to go to Beijing to petition the Fourth Plenary Session to revoke the law and remove Foreign Minister Wang, who privately enacted the law, in order to demonstrate the party and the country's grand intentions and comfort the hopes of all overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of All Trade Unions in the City</h3>
<p>▲Support the Permanent Organization of Trade Unions ▲Resolved to Jointly Send a Telegram Requesting the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>▲Declaration Issued by the Delegation Petitioning in Beijing</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, all two hundred trade unions in the city held a joint meeting in support of the permanent organization of trade unions. Those present included representatives from the British American Tobacco Factory Trade Union, Huacheng Tobacco Factory Trade Union, Shanghai Mercerizing Industry Trade Union, Postal Workers Union, Huashang Electric Trade Union, Commercial Press Trade Union, Press Trade Union, Silk and Satin Dyeing Trade Union, Western Furniture Trade Union, Lianglu Catering Trade Union, and various other trade unions in the city, totaling more than one hundred organizations and more than two hundred representatives. Yang Youren, chairman of the Commercial Press Trade Union, was elected to chair the meeting. After the formalities, the chairman first reported that since the Ministry of Industry and Commerce promulgated Article 10 of the Implementation Law of Trade Associations, which restricts trade union members to elect one representative to join the trade association for every fifteen or more people, all the trade unions in the city were panicked. A joint meeting was convened and representatives were sent to Beijing to petition the Fourth Plenary Session. The results are still unknown. However, the various trade unions in the city have not yet made a substantial statement of mutual concern as workers, so today a joint meeting of all trade unions in the city is held to support the existence of trade unions. I hope that all representatives present will express their opinions as much as possible to seek ways to help. The agenda was then discussed: (1) Each trade union will jointly submit a petition to the Fourth Plenary Session requesting the promulgation of separate laws and regulations for trade unions. (2) All economic problems will be temporarily covered by each trade union. (3) The Postal Workers Union and the Commercial Press Trade Union will be responsible for drafting the written communication. (4) The signing of the petition will be divided into six major areas, with each area responsible for signing by two trade unions: South Shanghai, Zhabei, Pudong, West Shanghai, East Shanghai, and Central Shanghai. (5) The written communication will be sent by telegram tomorrow (the 15th) and the petition will be sent on the 17th. (6) The telegram from the trade union representatives petitioning in Beijing will be published in various newspapers. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM. The declaration is copied below: "Since the various trade unions in Shanghai heard that the central government had a message to abolish the staff unions and merge them into the trade associations, the various trade unions publicly elected representatives to go to Beijing on the 25th of last month to petition the central government and various organs. Although the central government took into consideration the hidden feelings of the staff members and allowed the abolition to be temporarily delayed, which showed consideration for public opinion and accommodation of public opinion, the word 'temporary' still belongs to a swallow's nest on the curtain, which is not safe for long. Therefore, hundreds of thousands of staff members in the city are panicked and worried. Therefore, after internal and external troubles, the various trade unions in the city have no choice but to elect Hu Shouqi of the Calligraphy and Painting Fan Trade Union, Zhao Zhenhui of the Pharmaceutical Trade Union, Zhu Xiaoyun of the Silk and Cloth Dyeing Trade Union, Yu Yaoqiu of the Taikang Food Trade Union, Weng Ruifu of the Sauce Trade Union, Cai Xiaohe of the Tea Trade Union, and Sang Yutang of the Pharmaceutical Trade Union as representatives to go to Beijing with a petition to make a final petition to the Fourth Plenary Session. I secretly thought that the Fourth Plenary Session is a meeting to reform politics and strive for construction. For events that should be promoted and reformed in the country, it can especially be based on the intention of a single word to revitalize the country. Whether the organization of our staff unions is determined is not only related to the hopes of the people, but also to the country. It is impossible to make a part of the people feel frustrated. I think the advanced parties and countries in the Fourth Plenary Session will be able to consider the situation and consider the feelings of the people. The organization of trade unions should be promulgated as soon as possible, and the separate laws and regulations for staff members should be determined as soon as possible. The people who were oppressed by warlords in the past were revived by the Fourth Plenary Session of the revolutionary government, which was watered by a sprig of Yang Zhi. How can their songs of praise and virtue only let Yao Tian Shunri be beautiful in the past? I dare to reveal my feelings in the hope that the authorities will adopt them. This is a declaration, and I beg you to judge it."</p>
<h3>The Directorate General of Posts Cables to Negotiate the Return of Russian-Detained Mail</h3>
<p>During the conflict between China and Russia, the mail sent from this port to various places, all those passing through the Soviet Russian region, were detained by the Russian side, totaling more than one hundred bags. Since the end of the Sino-Russian conflict, although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly negotiated with the Soviet Russian authorities for its return, there has been no reply from the other side so far. The Directorate General of Posts believes that most of the detained mail is registered and express mail. If it is lost due to detention, it will inevitably be blamed by most senders. Therefore, it yesterday sent a telegram to the Ministry of Communications, asking it to quickly consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and actively negotiate to ensure that all the detained mail of more than one hundred bags is returned.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Opening Dispute</h3>
<p>The Shanghai silk industry is suffering losses, leading to factory closures. The livelihoods of over ten thousand workers are at stake. As a result of negotiations, thirty-two factories are reopening with reduced burdens. This has been reported in our newspaper. On the 11th, thirty silk factories in various districts convened representatives of male and female workers, informing them of the factories' difficulties and the efforts being made to resume operations to support the workers' livelihoods. The factories stated that they would lose at least two hundred taels of silver for each bale of silk purchased and would incur more losses for each day of operation. At the time, the female workers' representatives expressed agreement, only requesting that wages be increased once the price of silk in foreign markets improved and exceeded one thousand taels. The factories agreed to this. Workers in other districts also understood and accepted the situation. However, a small number of workers in the Hongkou district raised objections, demanding that all factories reopen simultaneously instead of just a few initially. On the evening of the 12th, they secretly forced mechanics and firemen in the nine silk factories scheduled to reopen in the Hongkou district to sign documents prohibiting them from lighting the furnaces or providing power. Later, Zhu Jing'an, a standing committee member of the industry association, offered earnest advice, and the workers eventually complied. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning (the 14th), more than ten factories in the Zhabei, Xin Zha, and Hudong districts that were preparing to reopen resumed work as usual. However, in the Hongkou district, as the nine factories scheduled to reopen were lighting their furnaces and starting their machines, a man named Chen Zhongxiang (an employee of the Yichang Silk Factory) led a group of people to each factory to prevent them from starting their furnaces. Later, at the Yuanfeng Silk Factory on Dixiwei Road, they forced all factory employees to sign documents prohibiting the resumption of work and threatened the factory manager, Wang Zaisheng, saying that if the factory reopened, there would be bloodshed. The factory owner arrived and tried to persuade Chen and his group, but Chen was disrespectful and made many threatening remarks. The police detectives stationed at the factory witnessed the situation and considered Chen Zhongxiang's actions to be unlawful, as he was openly preventing the factories from reopening and obstructing the workers' livelihoods. Furthermore, they discovered that Chen Zhongxiang was a subversive element who was already wanted by the garrison headquarters. Now, he was inciting the public to coerce a strike and intimidating the factory owners, which could not be tolerated. They planned to arrest him, but Chen attempted to escape to avoid punishment. The police pursued and apprehended him, taking him to the third precinct of the fifth district. After a short time, he was transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for further investigation. In the afternoon, dozens of employees who sympathized with Chen Zhongxiang gathered at the third precinct of the fifth district, surrounding it on all sides and demanding Chen Zhongxiang's release. The precinct chief, Zhang, explained that Chen had already been handed over to the police bureau. The employees then went to the Silk Industry Association, demanding that Chen Zhongxiang be released before any negotiations on reopening the factories could take place. The standing committee members of the association refused, stating that the authority to release Chen lay with the government and that they had no power to intervene. The employees, unable to achieve their objective, left in frustration. After receiving reports of the disturbances from various factories, the Industry Association, in addition to submitting reports to higher authorities requesting protection, also sent Chairman Shen and others to the municipal party headquarters, the municipal government, the social bureau, and the public security bureau to personally explain the situation.</p>
<h3>Startling Imports of Japanese Artificial Silk</h3>
<p>▲One of the Reasons for the Silk Industry's Decline ▲Potentially Exceeding 30 Million Yuan This Year</p>
<p>According to a recent investigation, the Chinese silk industry has declined sharply in recent years, while imports of artificial silk from various countries have increased dramatically. This indicates the wide distribution of artificial silk in the country. Considering Japan alone, from January to September of this year, the total export of artificial silk nationwide exceeded 23 million yuan. It is estimated that by the end of the year, this figure could increase to over 35 million yuan. Among these, 1,805 bales were imported to Shanghai, with a value of 988,000 yuan, and 3,781 bales were imported through Hong Kong, with a value of 1.443 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Guarantee Required for Obtaining Passports for Overseas Travel</h3>
<p>▲To Avoid Being Repatriated</p>
<p>The municipal government approved a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that in recent years, there have been cases of Chinese citizens being repatriated after obtaining passports for overseas travel. The Ministry, aware of this issue, has stipulated in Article 9 of the Provisional Regulations for Passports that a firm guarantee is required before a passport can be issued to prevent such incidents from happening again. Therefore, going forward, the regulations will be strictly enforced to rectify this problem. The municipal government instructed the Public Security Bureau to comply with these instructions yesterday.</p>

<h3>British Merchant Ship Turns Around, Causing Major Disaster</h3>
<p>▲Two Pier Sections Collapse into the River ▲More Than Ten Civilian Boats Capsized</p>
<p>▲Cook's Apprentice Wu Fulin Dies Tragically ▲Losses on All Sides are Substantial</p>
<p>The merchant ship *City of Johannesburg*, belonging to the British trading firm Jardine Matheson, was loading cargo in Shanghai yesterday for export to England and Germany. While turning around in the Huangpu River, it struck and damaged the Mitsubishi wharf where Nisshin Kisen's ships are docked, and also caused multiple cargo boats to sink, drowning one boatman. The details of this incident are reported as follows:</p>
<p>▲British Ship Strikes Pier</p>
<p>At 8:35 AM yesterday, the British ship *City of Johannesburg* departed from the Jardine Matheson wharf, being towed by a Wheelock &amp; Co. tugboat. To turn the ship around, it was towed in front of the Sanyang Wharf of the Nisshin Kisen Company (also known as the Mitsubishi Wharf, where ships to Luoyang, Yueyang, and Nanyang are docked). Although the river is wide at that point, the current is the strongest, and accidents are not uncommon. As the *City of Johannesburg* was turning in front of the wharf, the tugboat had already turned its head, but the bow of the large ship, affected by the tide, lost its direction and crashed into the southern pier of the Nisshin Kisen Wharf. Due to the massive impact, the pier suddenly shifted north, and two pier sections collapsed into the river due to the loss of support. This area is lined with cargo ships loading goods for the Japan Mail Line and fishing boats. The collapse of the pier and the impact of the ship caused a major disaster.</p>
<p>▲Cargo Barges and Fishing Boats Capsize</p>
<p>The area where the pier sections collapsed was on the inner side of the wharf, where six salvage boats were docked. These six boats were destroyed by the pressure of the collapse. On the eastern side, civilian boats carrying export cargo for the Japan Mail Line ship *Asama Maru* were docked. As the pier collapsed into the water and the southern pier was pushed north by the British ship by several zhang, four cargo boats belonging to Wu Minggen, Shen Rongfa, and others, which were carrying rapeseed and cotton yarn, were crushed or sunk outside the *Asama Maru*. The cargo of sesame and cotton yarn was lost in the water, causing huge losses. The hulls of the boats were also severely damaged. Wu Fulin, a boatman from Wu Minggen's boat, fell into the water and drowned before he could be rescued.</p>
<p>▲Losses Estimated to Be Significant</p>
<p>A total of ten cargo barges and fishing boats inside and outside the pier were struck, damaged, or capsized by the British ship. Fortunately, there were many boats nearby that came to the rescue, and the boatmen who fell into the water were rescued first. The cargo that fell into the water was also salvaged urgently. Fifty bales of cotton yarn, loaded by the Japan Cotton Yarn Co., were all recovered, and about two hundred bags of sesame were also partially recovered. In total, the damaged boats on the inner side of the pier included six fishing boats belonging to Zhao Jiayu and others, as well as one Jiangbei boat belonging to Liu Bucheng. In the middle of the two piers, three wharf boats belonging to Shen Xinhua, Wu Minggen, and Qian Afu were damaged. According to the loss reports submitted by the various boat owners, (1) Wu Minggen's boat suffered losses of 2,500 yuan, (2) Shen Rongfa's and Shen Shenshi's boats suffered combined losses of over 1,900 yuan, (3) Shen Zhongfu suffered losses of 850 yuan, (5) Liu Bucheng suffered losses of 259 yuan, (6) Shen Rufa suffered losses of 73 yuan. The loss amounts from Shen Hualin and others have not yet been reported.</p>
<p>▲Drowned Boatman Sent for Autopsy</p>
<p>Wu Fulin, son of Wu Minggen, was only seventeen years old. He worked on the boat and fell into the river when the boat was struck and overturned. After being retrieved by the water patrol captain and the police with the help of his father, he had already drowned due to ingesting too much water. The water patrol captain sent the body to the Rescue Bureau for an autopsy and then returned it to the family for burial.</p>
<p>▲Water Police Assist in Rescue</p>
<p>After the incident, the First Squad of the Water Patrol received the news and immediately dispatched patrolmen Song Kuiyuan, Ren Jianming, and others to assist in the rescue. Afterwards, a reporter met with Liu Qimin, an officer of the Water Patrol Headquarters, who provided an account of the incident and a report on the actions taken by the team.</p>
<p>At 9:45 AM on the 14th of this month, a sailor named Jin Qianlong reported that a British merchant ship belonging to Jardine Matheson had damaged the Mitsubishi Wharf while turning around for export, and also damaged multiple cargo boats and fishing boats carrying foreign yarn. Police officers Sun Deqi and others were already assisting in the rescue and salvage efforts. Patrol officers Song Kuiyuan, Ren Jianming, Hou Buyun, Cheng Xuyuan, Lu Songxin, and others were immediately dispatched to assist in the rescue and salvage efforts. Hired laborers were used to salvage the cargo. A total of 50 bales of foreign yarn and 100+ bags of sesame were recovered. The sesame boat owner, Wu Minggen, was brought in for questioning. He stated that his boat had loaded 220 bags of sesame at Laogang yesterday and was docked between the north and south piers of the Mitsubishi Wharf this morning, intending to unload it onto the Japanese ship *Asama Maru*. However, at 8:35 AM, a British ship belonging to Jardine Matheson suddenly struck the southern pier while turning around for export. The pier was pushed northward by several zhang, damaging the civilian boat and causing approximately 200 bags of sesame to fall into the water. At the same time, Wu Minggen's 17-year-old son, Wu Fulin, was knocked into the water and drowned. After being retrieved, he was already dead. The officer personally went to the wharf to conduct a detailed inspection. It was found that the north and south wooden piers were approximately four zhang apart. Wu Minggen and others' boats were docked south of the northern pier. After being struck, the southern pier was pushed northward by more than three zhang and westward by about one zhang. The damage included six fishing boats belonging to Zhao Jiabao and others inside the pier, one Jiangbei boat belonging to Liu Bucheng, and three wharf boats belonging to Shen Xinhua, Wu Minggen, and Qian Afu between the two piers. Instructions were given to the respective boat owners to submit a list of losses, and a separate report was to be submitted. The body of Wu Fulin was to be sent to the Rescue Bureau for an autopsy. A report was duly submitted.</p>
<p>▲British Ship Immediately Leaves Port</p>
<p>After the incident, the British ship immediately left the port, as only a small portion of its bow was damaged. The affected boatmen are negotiating compensation with Jardine Matheson through official channels, as well as requesting funeral expenses for the deceased. The Nisshin Kisen Wharf, which was severely damaged by the ship, is assessing the damage and will also negotiate compensation with Jardine Matheson while making repairs.</p>
<h3>Water Police Suppress Pirates</h3>
<p>▲Hundreds of Pirate Ships ▲Residents Flee Empty-Handed ▲Infighting Among Pirate Leaders</p>
<p>On the 8th, in the waters outside Wusongkou, such as Fengli, Juegang, and Changsha, a large number of pirate ships, estimated at over one hundred, suddenly appeared from the north and south. The total number of pirates was estimated to be over two thousand. After the pirate ships concentrated in those waters, bugle calls and gunfire were frequently heard for several days. Although no one has landed to cause trouble, they have not yet left. Residents living along the coast in those areas are terrified. Families with even a small amount of wealth are afraid that the pirates will land and loot their homes, so they are fleeing to other places en masse, leaving many homes empty. The water and land police stationed in those areas are too weak to suppress them, so they have sent urgent telegrams to the Fourth District Seventeenth Squad of the Wusong Water Police and various counties such as Rugao and Haimen, warning them of the situation. They have also dug ditches of several zhang along the village roads, pedestrian paths, and crossroads at various ports to obstruct traffic, concentrating their forces at key points to maintain strict vigilance day and night to prevent any eventuality. However, according to news from the Water Police yesterday, the pirates have not yet landed to loot. It is said that a dispute over the distribution of spoils occurred between the two major pirate leaders, Shen Guanxi and Pan Kaiwu. As a result, another group of pirates has invited both parties to meet in those waters to mediate. If the negotiations fail, a fierce battle will ensue. Captain Gong of the Seventeenth Squad of the Water Police has dispatched a patrol ship to take advantage of the situation and suppress the pirates.</p>
<h3>News of the Support Xiao Rally</h3>
<p>▲Enthusiastic Participation in Joining the Organizers ▲Overseas Chinese Federation Decides to Wait Several More Days</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation sent a letter to various organizations requesting them to initiate and convene an all-sector rally to discuss methods for "Supporting Xiao, Eradicating Shame, and Resolving the Suffering of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies." The news has been reported in this newspaper. It has been learned that the federation has received replies from organizations such as the Chinese Overseas Chinese Affairs Advancement Association, the China Vocational Education Society, the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center, the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Joint General Association, the Taiwan Chinese General Association, the Shanghai Law School, the Yixing Fellow-Townsmen Association, the Xiao Case Support Association of Yixing Sojourners in Shanghai, and the Shanghai National Goods Factory Association, agreeing to join in to uphold national rights and redress public grievances. However, due to the short notice, some organizations have not had time to convene meetings to discuss the matter and have requested an extension so that they can participate unanimously after making a decision. The Overseas Chinese Federation has decided to wait several more days and then jointly send a letter to convene a rally to actively boycott the Java Company, hoping to achieve a final victory.</p>

<h3>Silver Turns into Platinum</h3>
<p>▲Value of Over 54,000 Gold Yuan ▲Russian Con Man's High Skill ▲Also Involved are Lawyer Luo Xi and Others</p>
<p>A Russian con man named Yixia Ning, residing at No. 381 Maierxi Ai Road in the French Concession, makes a living by fraud. Last month, he was carrying a bundle containing several hundred taels of fake platinum, loitering around the Aiduya Road area. He was spotted by Detective Juli Naici (transliteration) of the gambling squad of the French Police. The detective questioned him, but Yixia gave evasive answers. He was immediately taken to the police station. The bundle was opened, and after examination, it was sent to the Public Works Department for chemical analysis. It was discovered that the platinum was fake, made entirely of Chinese silver plated by the defendant. After being questioned by Detective Chief Xi, Yixia confessed that his accomplice made the fake platinum, and he intended to sell it to the Aidinggong Xierte Company in London, England. The platinum weighed 146 taels for No. 21, 144 taels for No. 22, and 143 taels each for Nos. 23 and 24, with a value of 54,625 gold yuan. The British consul had already signed the documents, and the United Import and Export Company on Bowuguan Road was arranging to send it by post or ship. The fake platinum had been insured for over 16,000 taels with an insurance company. If the fraud was discovered in London, they could claim that it had been swapped en route and collect the insurance compensation. They could also borrow a large sum from a bank in Shanghai by mortgaging the platinum. He claimed that the accomplices in the scheme included several people, including a foreign lawyer named Duoxi. The detective chief summoned the lawyer for questioning and then released him pending further instructions. Other accomplices were also ordered to be arrested, but they all fled. Yesterday, the police transferred Xia and Lawyer Du to the French court for investigation. Detective Chief Sacaier first presented the facts of the case, followed by questions from the Chinese and Western officials to the defendants. They were ordered to be detained and held for a future hearing.</p>
<h3>Tan Meiying Files for Divorce</h3>
<p>▲Zhao Guangzu Remains Unenlightened</p>
<p>Zhao Guangzu, who was previously infatuated with the prostitute Mei Fei, even went so far as to sign a deed of renunciation. He was also swindled out of money by the prostitute and Hu San (Yongquan), who spent it lavishly. He remains unenlightened. His wife, Tan Meiying, found out about it and hired Lawyer Lu Qi to sue the prostitute and others. Hu fled to avoid punishment, and Mei Fei was sentenced to two months in prison, suspended for two years. However, the prostitute is not satisfied with the verdict and is currently appealing. Zhao Guangzu is not grateful to his wife for protecting the family assets. Instead, he resents her and constantly picks quarrels with her, even resorting to violence. Ms. Tan feels that she can no longer live with him and has hired a lawyer to sue Zhao in the Special District Court for divorce. The main reasons are: 1. Zhao has physically assaulted her, causing injuries. 2. Zhao is willfully dissipated and neglects his family. 3.

<p>▲ Many Westerners Testify ▲ Eleven Families Join as Plaintiffs</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday's Debate Concluded ▲ Judgment Set for Next Tuesday</p>
<p>The New Sassoon firm lease broker Xing Dingcheng, who stirred up a sensation in Shanghai, led more than two hundred White Russian desperados, riding in seven or eight freight trucks, at ten o'clock in the morning on September 10th, to Qingyun Lane, Chongming Road, North Sichuan Road, for the illegal demolition of houses, injuring people, and robbery of property. After four hearings by the Shanghai Special District Court, yesterday was the fifth court hearing. The audience of tenants was as crowded as before, and representatives from all walks of life were also present in court to observe. At half past two in the afternoon, Judge Cheng took the bench and began the case. First, he asked the fireman's resume requested by the defendant's lawyer, Ding Rong. He replied that he was Russian and had been the deputy officer of the fire brigade for three years and nine months. His name was Ji Ni Kefu. He was asked, "Did you witness the demolition of houses in Qingyun Lane?" He replied, "I was strolling on that day and happened to pass by that place twice. The first time I saw few people. After I reported to the fire brigade, they immediately sent me with a fire truck. The second time I arrived, I saw many White Russians demolishing houses on the roof, and the order was extremely chaotic." He was asked, "There was no fire, why did you report to the brigade to send a fire truck?" He replied, "I was afraid of a fire, so I borrowed a phone from an electric company at the intersection to report to the brigade. When I arrived at the scene with the truck and saw no fire, I immediately drove back."</p>
<p>At that time, the chaos was even worse. A police patrol car also arrived, led by a Western patrol chief with more than thirty Chinese and Western police officers to suppress the scene. As for whether the defendant Xing Dingcheng was at the scene, he did not pay attention because there were many Chinese, and so on. Then,</p>
<p>the Western Division Chief of the Police Department testified. He was asked, "What is your name and what is your position?" He replied, "My name is Otu, and I am the district chief of the General Police Department." He was asked, "Did you see the demolition of houses in Qingyun Lane?" He replied, "Yes, Qingyun Lane is under the direct jurisdiction of the Hongkou Police Department, but the General Police Department also has jurisdiction. At ten o'clock that morning, I was in the office when someone reported that a fight had occurred on Chongming Road. I immediately led Chinese and Western police officers to the scene to suppress it. After arriving, I learned that</p>
<p>it was White Russians demolishing houses. I ordered the White Russians to stop working. I told them that the houses could not be demolished, and I ordered the White Russians to disperse quickly. I reported to the General Police Department that day, but only in general terms, and the scope was very small. As for the defendant Xing Dingcheng, I did not see him, nor did I pay attention to him," and so on. Then, the clerk of the Kung Ho Foreign Firm testified, giving his name as Qi Ni Kefen, a British citizen, working as a clerk at Kung Ho Foreign Firm. He was asked, "Are you really a clerk or an engineer?" He replied, "Working as a clerk is true." He was asked, "How did you know about the demolition of the houses that day?" He replied, "That day I was in the office, and someone called me and asked me to go. After measuring, I think it was the New Sassoon Foreign Firm that called,</p>
<p>asking me to demolish the houses, but I did not pay attention to whether the defendant Xing Dingcheng joined or not." Then, the plaintiff's witness Yang Quan testified. He was asked, "What is your name, position, and where do you live?" He replied, "My name is Yang Quan, from Jiangsu, and I operate</p>
<p>a Lu Gao Jian meat shop at the mouth of Renzhi Lane on North Sichuan Road, across from Qingyun Lane. I live in the upper floor of the shop." He was asked, "Did you see the demolition of houses in Qingyun Lane?" He replied, "Around ten o'clock on the morning of September 10th, I was reading a newspaper in the shop when suddenly three or four private cars arrived. One stopped at the door of my shop, and the rest stopped across the street, along the mouth of Qingyun Lane. Two Chinese and six or seven Westerners sitting inside jumped out hurriedly and ran into the lane. After a while, a large group of White Russians drove in, carrying long bamboo ladders and rushing into the lane,</p>
<p>then climbing onto the roof to carry out the demolition work. The situation was extremely chaotic. I then learned that a house demolition was taking place. About thirty minutes later, a large team of police officers arrived and the situation calmed down. As for whether the defendant was at the scene, I cannot specify, but I saw two Chinese emerging from the car, one wearing a Western suit and the other wearing Chinese clothes. Judging by their backs, they were slim and small in stature. I did not see their faces clearly, so I cannot identify them as to who they were. What I have said is all the true situation on that day, and I have nothing else to say." The interrogation reached this point.</p>
<p>Eleven shops joined as plaintiffs, including Guangyu Store on North Sichuan Road, Zhang Jiamo, Zhou Sanji, Zhou Ganchen, Shengfa Barber Shop, Zhu Qipeng, Qiantai Xing Store, Yin Zhixian, Tao San Restaurant, Li Shiqiao, Guangtai Rice Store, Ge Peiyuan, Xingfa Store, Tang Huilian, Qifa Store, Gao Jieyuan, Jiangnanchun Western Restaurant, Liangfa Store, and Huiran Hospital, among eleven businesses, participated as plaintiffs, demanding compensation for losses and requesting an injunction against the demolition of houses. Judge Cheng interrogated them one by one, which lasted for two hours before it was completed. Among them, the testimonies of Tang Huilian and Li Shiqiao</p>
<p>were the most indignant and described the attitude of the police on that day. Judge Cheng then announced the start of the debate, conducted by the plaintiffs' lawyers Wang Zuxun and Xue Jiaqi, and the defendants' defense lawyers Ding Rong, Wang Fusang, and Chen Zhongyin. After a round of eloquent arguments on both sides, Judge Cheng announced, "The debate is concluded. Next Tuesday at two o'clock in the afternoon, the verdict will be heard in the Second Criminal Court." The defendant Xing Dingcheng will remain released on bail. As for the protest of lawyer Wang Zuxun that the defendant's agent, lawyer Ding, was suspected of colluding with witnesses in violation of Article 176 of the Criminal Code, the article is not repeated.</p>
<h3>Confrontation of Key Criminals in the Kidnapping Case of Qu Chengqing</h3>
<p>▲ Convicted Criminals Brought to Court Yesterday ▲ All Said that Bao Lao Er Was the Leader</p>
<p>▲ Bao Claimed It Was a False Accusation Due to Grievances ▲ Result: All Were Detained for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Qu Chengqing, an employee of Tianxiang Foreign Firm, was kidnapped by bandits on Hai'ning Road on the night of January 11th of this year. He was later rescued by the police, and fourteen kidnappers were successively arrested and sentenced. At that time, several bandits confessed that the case was led by Bao Lao Er, Shi, and A Rong, accomplices of a certain detective. However, Shi fled far away upon hearing the news and has not been found. Bao had already been captured by the police and handed over to the Special District Court for further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court for further hearing. The police specially brought four bandits involved in this case, who were imprisoned in the Western prison, to court for questioning. First, the Zhang-surnamed criminal confessed that Shi A Lao, also known as Bai Tou Mao Rong Sheng, was the assistant of a certain detective and my master. Bao Lao Er was also an accomplice of a certain detective. Before kidnapping Qu, they called me to go with them. They said it was to arrest someone, so at first, I did not know it was a kidnapping. I did not get any money. Now I have been sentenced to death and am waiting for execution in prison, and so on. Two Wang-surnamed bandits also confessed that they were called by Shi and Bao to kidnap Qu, and the ransom note was hidden in Bao's house. They were not allowed to leave. If they disobeyed, they would be threatened with guns. Later, they took advantage of the opportunity to sneak out and were arrested. They have now been sentenced, one to death and one to life imprisonment, etc. Finally, He Qingsi (a former detective, sentenced to life imprisonment for this case) confessed that he had met Bao and Shi once at the Yingbin Hotel, and the topic discussed was purely the purchase of a car. Judge Wu then interrogated the defendant Bao Lao Er, who admitted to working as a detective, but confessed that after Qu Chengqing was kidnapped, I learned about the kidnappers' whereabouts and reported it to the detectives, so the case was solved. The bandits have been harboring resentment ever since, so they falsely accused me of being the leader. If I were indeed at the scene, the kidnapped person would naturally recognize me. Please summon Qu for questioning, and the truth will be clear, and so on. The court ordered the defendant to be taken back into custody, and the criminals remained imprisoned in the Western prison, to be interrogated again at a later date.</p>

<h3>Soviet Russian Trade Agency Suddenly Receives a Bomb</h3>
<p>▲ Extortion Letter in English but Signed with a Russian Name ▲ Li Wen Claims It's Against the Agency, Not Him Personally</p>
<p>The "Da Mei Evening News" reported that a bomb was found outside the office of the Soviet Russian Trade Agency at No. 2 Beijing Road on Tuesday evening. An attached threatening letter was found. Fearing further acts of violence by the bandits, the agency personnel have requested special protection from the police. The bomb was placed in a wooden box by a teenager dressed in rags who spoke broken English. He first asked the landlord of the property to deliver it to the Soviet Russian Trade Agency, but the landlord refused. The person then went upstairs to deliver it himself. An elevator operator saw him heading in the direction indicated by the landlord. A few minutes later, a coolie discovered the box and handed it over to Li Wen, the Shanghai manager of the Soviet Russian Trade Agency, the next morning. A letter was attached to the box, addressed to Mr. Li Wen for his receipt. It said, "Mr. Li Wen, a second real gift will be presented. Please wait a moment," and was signed with the letters B. R. P. The letter was in English, but the signature was in Russian. Li Wen reported to the police. Today, the police stated that the bomb was not dangerous, but Mr. Li suspects that someone secretly wants to destroy the agency. He personally has no enemies, but the agency, because it is established by the Soviet Russians, must be hated by the White Russians. In addition, a telegram from the Soviet Russian News Agency stated that after receiving this news, the Russian newspapers, especially the Moscow newspapers, are now criticizing the Chinese government for its inadequate protection of Soviet Russian people and institutions.</p>
<h3>Youth Drowns in Raging Waves</h3>
<p>▲ No Way to Rescue Him</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's fast Dahao class ferry, yesterday afternoon at three o'clock, carrying passengers from the company's Huatong Wharf in Lan Ni Du, Pudong, was returning to the Xiyangjingbang Wharf when suddenly, near a Japanese warship buoy outside the Xin Kai He, an unnamed youth, taking advantage of people's unpreparedness, suddenly jumped into the raging waves to commit suicide. The captain, Zhao Shengsheng, immediately stopped the ferry and, together with a nearby sampan, tried to rescue him. However, the youth's body was not seen for a long time, so it was impossible to rescue him. It is reported that the deceased was wearing a blue cloth gown, a black mandarin jacket, and a small hat, and was about twenty years old. Because he did not utter a word or leave a suicide note, his name, place of origin, and reason for suicide are completely unknown.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Owner Kidnapped by Bandits for Ransom</h3>
<p>▲ Ransom Reduced to Seventy-one Yuan ▲ Still Unable to Pay in Full Despite Scrimping and Saving</p>
<p>▲ Reported to Police Out of Discontent, Two Arrested</p>
<p>Yan Luxiang, a 46-year-old from Funing, resides at No. 76 Caojiadu, West Shanghai, and makes a living by renting out rickshaws. He is married to Madam Chen, and the couple has a close relationship. Unexpectedly, Yan, despite his modest economic circumstances, has also become the target of bandits' greed, and the details of the situation, as well as the small sum of money extorted, are indeed rare among kidnapping cases.</p>
<p>▲ Kidnapped in the Early Morning Yan Luxiang has been in the rickshaw business for sixteen years. He is usually frugal and diligent in his work, getting up at dawn to take care of his renters, which has become his routine. Around four o'clock in the morning on the 3rd of this month, just as he was getting out of bed, three bandits suddenly arrived, one dressed in military uniform, looking like a soldier, one wearing a black robe, and another with a pockmarked face. Claiming to be the adjutant of the army, the one in military uniform and the one with the pockmarked face each pulled out a pistol, aimed it at Yan's chest, and said, "Be sensible and come with me." Yan was panicked and didn't know what to do, so he had no choice but to obey. His wife, Madam Chen, witnessed her husband being robbed but had no way to call for help and feared being harmed, so she could only lament her helplessness.</p>
<p>▲ Torture Repeated After the bandits kidnapped Yan, they first took him to a teahouse in the Sampan Factory New Bridge area, where they sat for a while, and then hid him in room No. 26 of the Changzhou Hotel on North Zhejiang Road, threatening him in every way and repeatedly torturing him. However, Yan valued money as his life, and he was always poor, so no matter how they coerced him, he only listened to fate.</p>
<p>▲ Ransom Reduced Gradually The bandits saw that Yan was unable to redeem himself, and they had been hiding in the hotel for five days, which had cost them a lot of money, and they were also afraid of exposure. Therefore, they reduced the ransom from 300 yuan to 200 yuan and then to 100 yuan, but Yan still could not agree. At this point, although the bandits were filled with anger and considered themselves unlucky, they were still unwilling to let him go easily. So they asked Yan if he had any relatives in Shanghai. Yan replied that his cousins Chen Jiahe and Fu Zhaolian might be able to find a way to help him.</p>
<p>▲ Ransom Payment at the Teahouse At eight o'clock in the morning, a bandit named Yan Chongsan released Yan, led him to a certain teahouse on Touji Bridge, summoned Chen, Fu, Yan's wife Madam Chen, and his younger brother Luxian. After negotiations, the ransom was set at 71 yuan. Chen Jiahe first paid 16 yuan, Yan Bei paid 25 yuan, and finally, Yan's wife collected 7 yuan, totaling 48 yuan. There was still a shortage of 23 yuan, which they could not pay at that time, so they agreed to pay the remaining amount at the Tianbao Teahouse on Yaojia Stone Bridge in Zhabei at three o'clock in the afternoon on the day before yesterday (the 13th). Yan Chongshan put the money into his pocket. Before leaving, he said that if the money was not paid by the deadline, he would take drastic measures and told them his address before leaving.</p>
<p>▲ Reported to the Police for Arrest Although Yan Luxiang suffered a small loss after escaping from captivity, he was very unwilling, so he reported to Squad Leader He Xiong of the Investigation Team of the Fourth District of Zhabei the day before yesterday. He immediately led detectives Li Guiqing, Li Zongnian, Jiao Yunshan, Zhou Guicai, Zhang Bingqing, etc., to No. 44 Xingde Lane, Guangzhao Road, and arrested Yan Ziyu and Yan Hongsheng (also known as Yan Ziru) and brought them to the station.</p>
<p>▲ People in the Military According to Yan Ziyu's confession, he was a batman in the Headquarters of the Newly Compiled Third Brigade of the Anti-Rebel Army and had been serving at the front. He denied kidnapping Yan Luxiang and presented a passport to the case. According to Yan Hongsheng's confession, he was also a soldier of the Newly Compiled Third Brigade, and his confession was evasive. According to Yan Luxiang's confession, he firmly stated that Yan and others were assistants in the kidnapping case, and the principal offender, Gu Chongsan, had escaped. He also presented Gu's card, which read "National Revolutionary Army Anti-Rebel Army Army Newly Compiled Third Brigade Headquarters Major Adjutant". After reviewing the confession, the Director determined that the case involved kidnapping for ransom. In addition to arresting Gu Chongsan, he ordered Yan and others to be sent to the bureau for questioning first.</p>
<h3>Tianjin-Pukou Railway Changes Train Schedule</h3>

<h3>Reasons for the Public Concession's Ban on Dog Racing</h3>
<p>▲ Same Impact as Jai Alai Courts</p>
<p>The Da Mei Wan Bao (North China Daily News) reported that, according to reliable sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council's decision to close the dog racing track was a direct result of someone requesting a license to establish a jai alai court. Within the concession, there are no specific laws against gambling; it relies entirely on the cooperation of the consuls. The Municipal Council usually manages gambling by issuing licenses, so it generally does not issue licenses for gambling places. In the past, some gambling dens relied on certain consuls as protective charms and did not obtain licenses. Now, the Municipal Council naturally cannot grant a license for a jai alai court under any circumstances. However, dog racing tracks and jai alai courts are similar in nature, so it is inconvenient to treat them differently, hence the discussion to ban dog racing.</p>
<h3>Liang Shuxian's Embezzlement Case: Court Announcement of Judgment</h3>
<p>▲ Liang Should Repay 140,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Liang Shuxian, the head of the Revenue and Expenditure Section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, had been in his position for sixteen years since his appointment on the first day of the Republic, and was known as an "unshakeable figure." No matter which director took office, he was never transferred. Unexpectedly, Liang absconded without a trace on April 8th of this year. At the same time, his cashier, Yin Peimin, also abandoned his post and fled. Director Liu Weizhi investigated his accounts and found that he had embezzled 160,000 yuan when he fled this year. Later, because the guarantor only had a guarantee worth 20,000 yuan, there was still a shortage of 140,000 yuan. An arrest warrant was issued, but he has not been caught. Now, Director Liu has hired a lawyer to request a public announcement of the judgment in the Civil Court of the District Court. A judgment has been made that Liang Shuxian should repay 140,000 yuan. As for Yin Peimin, because of his low position and minor role, he is not held responsible. The announcement has now been posted.</p>
<h3>Yang Chenqing Has Given Birth to a Son</h3>
<p>▲ Accusation of Abandonment Against Lu Shijun ▲ Another Problem in the Future</p>
<p>Yang Chenqing, a former female employee of the Mei Di Bookstore, and her male colleague, Lu Shijun from Wuxi, fell in love and got engaged. However, both parties were impatient and cohabited. When Yang became pregnant, Lu abandoned her. Yang hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint with the Special District Court. The court has held two hearings, but Lu has failed to appear. Yang's pregnancy has now reached full term, and she went to the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital and gave birth to a son. It is said that after Yang became pregnant, Lu asked Yang that if she gave birth to a son, he should be raised by him. Now that they are involved in litigation, Yang will naturally not agree. Therefore, this piece of flesh will still be subject to disputes in the future.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Postal District Offers Small Remittance Drafts</h3>

<h3>The New Building in the Russian Incident Is Not the Academia Sinica</h3>
<p>Previously, this newspaper reported that a Russian on Route Ghisi (now West Yan'an Road) in Shanghai refused to pay wages and used a gun to injure people, mistakenly stating that the new building there belonged to the Academia Sinica. Yesterday, President Cai of the Academia Sinica sent a telegram from Nanjing to this newspaper to correct the record. The original telegram is as follows: To Shen Bao Newspaper Office: The November 13th report in your local news about a Russian using a gun to injure people involving the Academia Sinica is inconsistent with the facts. The building of our academy on Route Ghisi in Shanghai is a steel testing ground, which has long been completed and contracted by Zhu Senji Construction Company. As for the Russian who caused the incident, it is said that he is a worker at a nearby bakery set up by Westerners and has nothing to do with our academy. Please correct this. Cai Yuanpei.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Wharf Completion Ceremony Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Industry Association submitted a request to the authorities to allocate the section from Xuejia浜 to Santai Wharf for the construction of a rice industry wharf. Construction has now been completed, and the completion ceremony will be held on the 15th of this month (today), and rice boats will begin to dock. Yesterday, letters were sent to the rice merchants, informing all rice boats. However, the bean and rice businesses are mostly located in the Doushi Street area. With the completion of the rice boat wharf, rice boats will gather in one place after arriving in Shanghai. Therefore, all businesses dealing in rice and grain agreed the other day to move to the area south of the South Guild Hall to Xuejia浜 to facilitate operations. Empty houses in the Xuejia浜 area have been rented out in recent days, and rice shops have been opened. Recently, rice shops in Doushi Street have been moving there one after another, and the market in that area has suddenly become lively.</p>
<h3>A Bundle of Telegrams from the Directorate General of Telegraphs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Fuzhou telegraph line had been disrupted for half a year due to military operations by Lu Xingbang, resulting in a lack of communication. Telegrams to and from Guangzhou were transmitted by submarine cable, costing two jiao (cents) per word, which is twice as expensive as land lines, causing considerable inconvenience to the business community. Recently, the military situation has been resolved, and direct telegraphic communication between Shanghai and Fuzhou was restored yesterday morning. The Directorate General of Telegraphs in Shanghai is now processing telegrams to Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, Shantou, Guangdong, and other provinces in Fujian and Guangdong as usual. The direct Shanghai-Qingdao landline was also repaired yesterday morning. Reports can be sent directly without needing to be relayed through Yantai, which is exceptionally fast.</p>
<p>It is said that the Hankou-Chongqing telegraph line has been damaged for several years due to repeated internal turmoil and has recently been repaired in stages. Telegrams to Chongqing, Chengdu, and Sichuan can now arrive on the same day.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Ye Fikang Receives Reprimand</h3>
<p>▲ The Resolution Has Been Delivered Yesterday</p>
<p>Ye Fikang, a member of the Shanghai Bar Association, was appointed as the defense lawyer for the counter-revolutionary criminal Yan Xiaochu on October 27th of last year. At that time, a contract was established, stipulating that the total public fee for the three-trial conclusion was 5,600 yuan. Later, because Yan Xiaochu was shot, his family members asked Lawyer Ye to return the public fee, but Ye did not allow it. His family members then presented a request to the prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court, asking him to recover the money. The prosecutor believed that the counter-revolutionary case only had two trials, and Lawyer Ye clearly had illegal intentions. Therefore, the prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court requested the Chief Prosecutor of the High Court to submit it to the Jiangsu Lawyers Disciplinary Committee attached to the High Court for disciplinary action. On the 5th of this month, the chairman of the committee, Lin Biao, Fei Wen, Shen Yuan, Li Mian, Zheng Chi, and other members held a meeting and decided that Lawyer Ye Fikang should be reprimanded. The resolution has now been delivered yesterday (the 13th). The following is a copy:</p>
<p>Jiangsu Lawyers Disciplinary Committee Resolution No. 19 Law Character No. 2: Regarding Lawyer Ye Fikang, the lawyer who was subject to disciplinary action due to violating laws and regulations was submitted for disciplinary action by the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court. The decision of this committee is as follows: "Main text" Lawyer Ye Fikang shall be subject to a reprimand. "Facts" Lawyer Ye Fikang was appointed on October 18th as the defense lawyer for Yan Xiaochu, who was sued for a revolutionary case, agreeing that 600 yuan would be paid first until the third trial judgment, and after the release, a public fee of 5,000 yuan would be paid, and the public fee contract was attached to the file. Shi Yin Yan Xiaochu was shot on the same day after the contract was signed, and the lawsuit did not proceed. His family members asked for the unpaid public fee of 300 yuan, but it was not allowed. Therefore, the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court submitted a request to the Chief Prosecutor of the High Court to submit it for disciplinary action on the grounds that the lawyer received public fees and had fraudulent conduct towards the client. "Reasons" According to the Shanghai Bar Association's Provisional Regulations, Article 31, paragraph 1, item B, item 2, the total amount of public fees charged by lawyers for handling criminal cases must be specified separately according to the trial level. In this case, the disciplined lawyer Ye Fikang and the client entered into a public fee contract, and it was agreed that it would be until the third trial judgment. Regardless of whether the contract stated that the client committed a counter-revolutionary incident, the trial level was only two trials, and there was no third trial, and the amount of public fees agreed upon was a general package, and it was not divided according to the trial area in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations. It is a breach of good faith and violates the provisions of Article 18 of the Lawyers' Regulations. This committee believes that a reprimand should be imposed in accordance with Article 37, paragraph 1 of the same regulations, and a decision is made as follows. November 5, 19th year of the Republic of China, Jiangsu Lawyers Disciplinary Committee Chairman Lin Biao, Fei Wen, Shen Yuan, Li Mian, Zheng Chi.</p>
<h3>Russian Woman Commits Suicide Under Train</h3>
<p>At around 8 AM yesterday morning, a train from the Wusong Zhanghuabang Railway Factory to Shanghai, while passing near the Tiantong'an Station, suddenly a young Western woman rushed across the road and threw herself onto the tracks to commit suicide. The driver of the train was caught off guard and could not stop in time, so the woman's legs were crushed and her waist was broken, so she was divided into several sections, and the blood and flesh were a mess, which was unbearable to look at. After the accident, the train stopped immediately, and then the body was taken out and placed on the side of the road. It was found that the deceased was about twenty years old, was Russian, and was wearing a cyan gray woolen coat, a white silk shirt, colorful dance stockings, and leather shoes, and her attire was quite fashionable. The local police reported the incident to the Fifth District Police Station. At this time, the deceased's husband had already heard the news and rushed to the scene. It is said that the deceased woman's name was Anre, she was thirty-three years old, and because she had been sick for many years, she did not want to live, so she committed suicide. The deceased's husband's name is Eamerink, and he currently lives on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, requesting to be exempted from examination and to collect the body himself.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, Yesterday I read your newspaper's local news column about Zhenhua Garden owner Li Guohua's accusation against Wu Rongchang for failing to deliver the ordered goods. The content of the report does not match the facts. I will now briefly describe the course of events below, hoping that you will correct it as a prayer. In March of this year, a street vendor from our company indirectly introduced Mr. Li, who brought a package of rubber samples and claimed that they were German products, and entrusted Xinji Foreign Company to order 10 tons, with a limited price of 98 yuan and 405 taels per ton. Because we had never traded with Mr. Li before, we collected a deposit of 400 yuan. After the sample arrived in Germany, it was said that the goods were not produced there. When the German rubber sample was sent back, Mr. Li said that it did not match. At that time, we verbally cancelled the order, but Mr. Li said that he still had a bag of previous goods, so we could find out the place of origin. Therefore, we did not get the deposit back. When we saw the words "BOWBAY" printed on the bag, we found that it was Indian goods. Mr. Li then entrusted Xinji to order from that country, but there was no news yet. Mr. Li went to Xinji and said that he had found out that the goods were actually produced in Little Luzon. Xinji was entrusted to send a letter, but it was not a product of that place, and the deposit was returned. Mr. Li seemed to be honest and did not say anything unexpected. He was instigated by an intermediary, which led to this unexpected move, which is also Mr. Li's misfortune. Xinji Limited Company, a British company, November 14th.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>▲ A (Giving a cloud cigar to B) - How is the flavor of this cigar that I gave you?</p>
<p>B (Lights it up, takes a puff) - Ugh. The flavor is terrible. Why do you smoke such a low-grade cigar?</p>
<p>A - You should ask yourself. Because this cigar is exactly the one you gave me the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Wife (Wakes up in the middle of the night from the bed, pushes her husband violently) - Dear, wake up quickly! Wake up quickly! The alarm has been ringing for a while. The sky is full of red light. I'm afraid the whole city is on fire!</p>
<p>Husband (Yawns and gets up, slowly gets out of bed, feels the four walls, and then goes back to bed and lies down) - Don't make such a fuss. The four walls are still cold. Besides, our accounts are not on fire either.</p>
<p>▲ Judge (To the criminal) - You have admitted that you sneaked into that house through the back door at half past twelve last night. What did you sneak in for?</p>
<p>Criminal - I thought that house was my own house.</p>
<p>Judge - If so, when the mistress of the house heard the noise and came to check, why did you hide under the bed in the attic?</p>
<p>Criminal - I thought my wife was coming. Because I have always been afraid of her shrewishness. It's always like this.</p>
<p>▲ Woman - My love, you must come to my house tonight. I'm waiting for you.</p>
<p>Man - But I'm most afraid of that old man in your garden. He's staring at me with his eyes wide open.</p>
<p>Woman - Don't pay attention to him. He's just my father.</p>
<h3>Two Days After the Reading Movement</h3>
<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>On the first day of the reading movement, Mr. Hu already had an article on the reading movement published in this talk. Now, I will show the reader the main points of the speeches of Mr. Chen Zhongfan and Mr. Wang Yunwu, the two speakers in the following two days, so that he can get a glimpse of the whole picture.</p>
<p>▲ Extend it a little in reverse According to the program scheduled by the Youth Association, the speaker on the second day should have been Wang Yunwu. However, because Mr. Wang was attending the Industrial and Commercial Conference in the capital, he was elected as the drafter of the declaration and could not rush back. So, Chen Zhongfan was temporarily asked to advance his speech by one day. When the author went to the meeting at three o'clock the next day, he saw a temporary notice at the door saying that Mr. Wang's speech had to be postponed to six o'clock. He asked the administrative office for the reason. They said that Mr. Wang would arrive in Shanghai from the capital, probably after three o'clock, or even after five o'clock. Mr. Wang did arrive at six o'clock and said that as soon as he got off the car, he was pulled over by people from the meeting. Although he had entered his home, it only took thirty seconds and he had not even had dinner. It is because Mr. Wang knows that more than a thousand young people are waiting in the hall for teaching while hungry. Speakers and listeners are all engaged in hunger, which is also a good story in the academic world.</p>
<p>▲ What books does Mr. Chen read Mr. Chen Zhongfan's topic was "What books to read." He divided all the books in the country into large categories of historical, philosophical, and literary, and discussed them in detail. There were many unique insights, such as the saying that Wang Fuzhi once advocated nationalism, Wang Zongyi once advocated democracy, and Gu Yanwu once advocated the people's livelihood. He also said that there is no special history in this country, such as the history of education and the history of art. Therefore, people who initially want to study a specialized subject often have a sigh that they have nowhere to start. However, all records contain a lot of special historical materials. If you can find them by category, you can get very good special historical materials in two or three months. Mr. also earnestly told people that reading must lay a good foundation in basic science, especially the study of academic must have a mathematical geometry and other foundations. When Mr. spoke, his face showed a smile, and the gentle scholar atmosphere was enough to move the younger generation. Among the audience, there was a person with a round face and a slight beard, leaning against the platform, frequently turning his head, as a powerful expression of being convinced. It is also enough to see the depth of Mr. 's speech.</p>
<p>▲ How does Mr. Wang read Wang spoke about how to read books. First, he described three motivations for reading: being forced, for application, and being interested. He also said that the success of reading with interest is the greatest. Secondly, he described the joy of reading, saying that reading is actually chatting with the author. Not only can university scholars far away in Europe and the United States be in the same room, but also ancient sages thousands of years ago can be seen at the desk. The joy is endless. He also said that there are two difficulties in reading: one is the problem of time, and the other is the problem of money. However, both are not difficult to solve. We work eight hours a day and sleep eight hours, and there are still eight hours left, which can be used for reading. If it is halved, there are still four hours a day that can be used for reading. Regarding the issue of money, it is difficult for many people to live at a high level now, and even food and clothing are sometimes in short supply. In fact, we should know that reading should be as important as food and clothing. The stomach must be fed, and the brain must be fed. Hunger in the stomach makes it impossible to work, and an empty brain also makes it impossible to work. Therefore, we should economize on food and clothing to buy books to read. Saving three yuan a month is enough to buy about three hundred-page books. The number of words should be more than 480,000, and 6 million words can be read in a year. Then he described the four essentials of reading: reading more, doing more, seeing more, and thinking more. He also elaborated on the thinking aspect in detail. The main idea is that thinking is not afraid of having fantasies. It is because of fantasies that correct ideas can emerge. However, to have correct ideas, you must understand mathematics and geometry. The Chinese people's so-so, probably, and almost are clear evidence of the lack of mathematical minds. In the future, we must overthrow the so-so, probably, and almost before we can talk about academics. Finally, he said that reading must first identify the goal, what kind of specialized subject you want to learn, and then search for books related to this subject and study them according to a certain procedure, and never be aimless, but only seek to be broad. As a result, those who seek to be broad will not be able to do it, and will become neither fish nor fowl. When Mr. spoke, witty remarks were made frequently, and applause was constant.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Jazz Singer" After a Test Screening</h3>
<p>— Jin Kaixu</p>
<p>A man named Anderson, who is also a prominent figure in the stage life, recently said that with the advent of sound films, the stage's career will gradually diminish. This is not only the case for stages in small cities, but even the stages in New York will be affected. Since silent films became popular, the society has gained another medium of entertainment for the common people, and drama has already suffered a fatal blow. However, the songs and dances on the stage can be seen but not heard, and the interest is only half as good. Therefore, the stage can never be completely replaced. But now, with the advent of sound films, the mute can speak, the silent can make a sound, and the quiet becomes lively, achieving the wonderful effect of both sound and appearance. Thus, people do not need to watch real-life performances on the stage, but only need to place themselves in front of the silver screen. Every song and dance, every sound and color, can be intoxicating. Moreover, the greatness of sound films is far beyond the reach of the stage. The stage is limited by its location and cannot build a stage comparable to a photography studio. It is also limited by capital and cannot gather dozens or hundreds of stars in one place, or hundreds or thousands of actors in one location. Only films can do this. Understanding this, we can know that the reason why Ziegfeld and Paul Whiteman, who are famous for their songs and dances in New York, must rely on sound films is to fully display their skills. Paul Whiteman is a prominent figure in song and dance, and people even respect him as a king. That is why he is named "The Jazz Singer." "The Jazz Singer" was test-screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater a few days ago. The reporter was invited to watch it and felt its greatness. Not only could it not be performed on the stage, but it was also difficult to compete with among many song and dance films. The whole film is in full color, and the magnificence can be said to have reached the extreme. The abundance of songs and dances is especially evident in the final "Melting Pot of Music," which almost melts the essence of music into one furnace and becomes a modern golden refinement for enjoyment. The famous songs, such as "It Happened in Monterey," "Song of the Dawn," and "I Like to do Things for You," are all structures that were popular for a time.</p>
<h3>Rare and Interesting News from the Art World</h3>
<p>▲ Yang Du's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition: The mundane world is unbearably vulgar. On Sunday, I finally had a day of leisure and wanted to find a place to cleanse my ears and eyes, but I couldn't find one. Unexpectedly, I found it in the Nanjing Road in the heart of Xihua, which was truly beyond my expectations. What place is it? It is the Yicheng Calligraphy and Painting Society. The society is hosted by Mr. Qian Huafu. Recently, it is holding the Yang Du Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition. I went there with Mr. Jin Shouchun. We climbed the stairs from Yunnan Road. At that time, it was the time when layman Wan Shaoshi was lecturing on the scriptures. More than twenty people sat solemnly and listened quietly. The topic was the essence of Zen Esoteric Buddhism. Unfortunately, I didn't understand Zen principles, so I looked up at Mr. Yang's calligraphy and paintings. Most of them were vertical scrolls, with iron-like strokes and silver hooks, ancient and unparalleled. His paintings, in particular, had a unique style, beyond Qingxiang Bada. Without natural talent, it would be difficult to create such a wonderful realm. The inscription on the "Cherishing Yin Picture" painted by Huafu, "A moment, thousands of eons," is especially thought-provoking. I sighed in admiration. (Dao Cun)</p>
<p>▲ Yu Yushuang's Posthumous Works Exhibition: Mr. Yu Yushuang, a famous painter from Guian, has become more famous since he passed away. Those who obtain even a small piece of his silk or paper regard it as a treasure. On the fifteenth day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar, it was Yu Yushuang's birthday in the afterlife. Friends Shang Shengbo, Chen Wenfu, Ma Qizhou, Xiong Songquan, Qian Shoutie, Ren Jinshu, Lü Shiqian, Sun Xueni, and Tang Jisheng, etc., set up an altar at Chongfa Temple on Guling Road to offer prayers for his soul. They also held a posthumous works exhibition. Dozens of Mr. Yu's famous paintings were hung on the four walls, including flowers, figures, ladies, and landscapes, all of which were excellent. On both sides of the altar, couplets written by He Tianjian were hung, with extremely detached and powerful words. The couplet written by Qian Shoutie said: "Why bother to write a grand summons? Look at the paintings filling the room, as if the spirit banner is carrying rain. Just to commemorate the birthday, grieving for a hundred years of friendship, the cold flute of the neighborhood presses close, causing people to sigh and admire." In the evening, painters gathered. The host monk prepared a vegetarian meal to entertain the guests and asked for paintings and calligraphy. Shoutie and Tianjian each painted a Luohan, Songquan painted a pair of lions, Qizhou wrote a pair of cranes, Shengbo painted flowers, and Xueni painted landscapes. Jinshu inscribed poems on each of them. A total of eight collaborative works were created. The host monk was overjoyed and bowed with his palms together in worship. By the time the guests dispersed, it was already past midnight. (Yan Zi)</p>
<p>▲ Xing Hua Lou's Pre-exhibition of Ji Chong: I have been writing in Shanghai for three years. Stepping into the art world, I have humbly followed in the footsteps of others. Holding a pen and writing, the ingrained habits are hard to change. Unfortunately, my talent is limited and I am not capable of traveling a thousand miles. However, by persevering and accumulating little by little, I have gradually made progress. Not daring to be complacent with my meager achievements, I held a personal exhibition to seek correction from those who are knowledgeable. Before the exhibition, I held a pre-exhibition at Xing Hua Lou, and I was honored by the gracious presence of many friends and seniors, who gave me advice and encouragement. I was also fortunate to have them order my works in advance, so that all the exhibits were sold out. I am deeply grateful for their kindness and friendship. Mr. Binhong inscribed "True Strength Fills, Energy Flows Like a Rainbow, Encompassing All Things, Obtaining the World." Layman Daqian inscribed "Primordial Energy Drips, the Hanging Still Wet." Mr. Shanzi and Mr. Ying Peng both inscribed "A Dazzling Array." Mr. Yamada Kenkichi inscribed "Artistic Essence." Mr. Tao Min inscribed "Ten Thousand Mountains Gather Verdure." Elder Ruosou inscribed "Forming One's Own School." Mr. Shujuan inscribed "A Myriad of Phenomena." Mr. Jianfu inscribed "A Majestic Atmosphere." Mr. Qingshan Nong inscribed "All Aspects Complete." Mr. Zheng Bai inscribed "Ancient and Lush." Mr. Gong Zhen inscribed "Wonderful Ink and Refined Brush." Mr. Zuyi inscribed "I Cannot Paint, But I Like to Read Paintings, Especially Mr. Yu's Paintings." Mr. Yimin inscribed "Ink Interest Abounds." Mr. Ganyuan inscribed "Clouds and Smoke Pass Before the Eyes." Mr. Shoutie inscribed "Spanning Ancient and Modern." Layman Hongli inscribed "Ethereal and Mysterious." Mr. Manqing inscribed "A Hill and a Ravine Startle People." Mr. Wuchang inscribed "Wandering with the Creator." The praise is excessive, and I cannot help but blush. I should write it on my belt and inscribe it on my seat as a means of encouragement. The exhibition will be held for three days, on the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth, at the Ningbo Fellow Association on the fourth floor of Xizang Road. I sincerely hope that enlightened people from all walks of life will come to teach me. (Yu Jianhua)</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Nanyang (72)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>I asked the host if there were tigers in this place. The host put down his opium pipe and looked displeased. "Don't say that," he said. "You shouldn't say that when you are going out." I asked, "Why not?" He replied, "You can only say 'big object'." I've been here for over ten years and I've never heard anyone say that." I knew that he held a mystical meaning. He also said, "There are also 'small objects', which are leopards." I asked if there were snakes. He said, "You can also call them 'old brushes'. Don't say 'snakes'." I asked if they were harmful. He answered no. However, the host's tone was mystical, so I didn't inquire further.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is the beard of the Indian people. It is extremely long and dirty. They don't know to shave it off. They say that they have kept it since they were young, believing that it is a male attribute used to strengthen their power. I often say that women consider beauty as beauty, while men consider the ability to kill as beauty. That is, they consider great ugliness as beauty. Looking at the beard of the Indian people, it seems to be this meaning.</p>
<p>The Burmese people have a view of life that is both impermanent and pleasure-seeking. This can be proven by their love of theater. The Burmese have the custom of going to the theater from night until dawn. Men and women who love theater sleep together in the theater, indulging in the joys of entertainment. Once, there was an incident in which monks requested to listen to the opera and were stabbed to death by government police. This was caused by the famous Burmese actress Pu Xin. Posing Pu Xin Dan is old now. She is the Mei Lanfang of Burma. Her performance tickets cost four or five shields per person. Now she has hundreds of thousands of dollars. The British government sent two guards to protect her. Pu Xin opposed monks watching the opera and demanded that tickets not be sold to monks. In the middle of the Burmese theater, there are preferential seats for monks. I observed that there were two rows reserved for them, and the tickets were half price. It was like our military. The monks could not oppose Pu Xin, so they confronted the police who were protecting Pu Xin. They even formed a team and fought the police in a bloody battle. As a result, an order was issued prohibiting monks from traveling in groups of two. Two monks had to be fifty steps apart. This lasted for several days. From this, we can see the Burmese people's love of theater and the monks' recklessness.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (315)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Tears Fall in All Directions, Red Emotions in Sadness; A Hall is Captivated, Green Intentions Linger</p>
<p>Among Ling Zhixiang's five or six wives, there are not only Chinese wives but also foreign wives. Two friends who were shocked by the development of women's rights in Europe wondered how difficult the foreign wives were to serve. They asked him how he integrated the East and West into one, not only with a well-managed domestic affairs but also as a diplomatic expert. According to him, foreign wives are also easy to serve. Foreign women have the temperaments of foreign women. If you can grasp their temperaments, there is nothing to fear. They also value face. If you give them face, it will be fine. They also value love. Once they follow you, they prioritize love. Of course, everything can be discussed. Unlike Chinese women, they can be very stubborn and have a special kind of temperament. Neither hard tactics nor soft tactics work. That is really difficult. Foreign women, especially those married from foreign countries, are even more so. When they come to China, they are completely clueless about everything. Even women who grow up in Shanghai mostly associate with foreigners. They don't understand much about the situation in China. They haven't picked up any of the bad habits or bad tempers of Chinese women. As for the bad habits and bad tempers of foreign women, once they marry a Chinese man, Chinese etiquette can be used to restrain them. Therefore, marrying a foreign woman is not difficult to deal with, as long as you handle it properly. However, it is best for foreign wives to live in foreign-style homes and not live with Chinese wives. If a foreign wife lives in the interior and assimilates with Chinese wives, it will be much more difficult. She will learn all the bad habits and bad tempers of Chinese women, plus the inherent bad habits and bad tempers of foreign women, and it will never be good. Many people admire Ling Zhixiang's words. However, there are still few people in China who marry foreign wives. Ling Zhixiang can be considered to have a unique perspective. If another person marries a foreign wife, I wonder what other methods they would use. In short, Ling Zhixiang takes an isolationist approach, so his invitations are also distinguished by order of priority. He doesn't let them meet. As for the invitation card, a large character is added under the character "Ling," which also has a special meaning. Because there are two guests with the surname Ling. One of them, who is also named Ling, seems to be a bit of a rogue. They don't want to invite him, but they are afraid that Ling Zhixiang invited him. It would be bad not to go. So they asked Ling Zhixiang to write a large character under the character "Ling." He is obviously the "Big Ling." The one without the large character is of course the "Little Ling." This is a mark on the invitation card to distinguish between the two. You can then decide whether to go or not. Lin Fanzi wrote down the invitation cards for each person. When he got to Long Ziyun, he said, "You are inviting Bao Meiyun. Let me write it down for you." Long Ziyun said, "No, I'll write 'Green Intentions'."</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Sudden Turmoil in the Financial and Gold Markets</h3>
<p>▲ Hamaguchi Assassination Disrupts Market: Yesterday, the gold market continued its downward trend, with violent fluctuations that were difficult to predict. The day saw a total of more than seven taels of twists and turns, with sudden drops and jumps, creating extreme confusion. The momentum was unstoppable. Transactions among peers were divided, with some selling first and then buying later. Yuan Maoyong, Taixing, Bingxing, and Taihengyuan, among others, bought in, while Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yu Da, Zhifengyong, and the Dalian gang sold out. The market initially opened low due to rising silver prices overseas. Later, foreign exchange rates also rose by almost half a point, and the domestic market seemed weak. Bank withdrawals were uneven. The gold price was suppressed to eighty-six or eighty-seven taels when news broke of the assassination of Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi. As the news spread, the market lost confidence. Major players tended to sell, causing a sudden turmoil and a sharp drop of four or five taels. The situation then eased slightly, but a second telegram reporting the severe nature of his injuries caused another sharp drop of four taels, almost like a river flowing downhill. The price plummeted to slightly above eighty-one taels. Later, the Dalian gang and others resumed buying, while retail investors sold, likely because the swap period had arrived and it was not advisable to sell. In particular, various firms were even mutually swapping in advance, with the bullish side advancing, initially at four or five taels, and later soaring to around seven taels. As a result, the market price rebounded sharply, quickly reaching above eighty-seven taels. However, the situation was vague. Amidst the swap orders, a sudden and unexpected change occurred.</p>
<p>▲ Fierce Winds and Rains, Dangerous Signs Everywhere: The December opening in the morning immediately dropped by seven cents, to 587.88 taels, likely because of the recovery of the London silver price by one-eighth and the silver price by one-quarter. Then, due to buying by another firm, it rose by seven or eight cents, totaling 688.6 taels. Later, due to selling by Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Chengyong, and Yongkang, and also because HSBC sold British gold worth 173,125 and Sumitomo sold US dollars worth 39,125, it immediately plunged by more than two taels, totaling 686.23 taels. When the first announcement was made, it added one tael, to 687.23 taels. Yongfeng then bought, but the listed British gold rate increased by 0.125, Citibank by 0.25, and the Japanese gold rate fell by one cent, immediately dropping to 686.4 taels. Afterward, it remained flat, standing around 686 taels. Shortly after hearing the news of Hamaguchi's assassination, the market atmosphere suddenly became fatigued. In an instant, it plummeted by three taels. Zhifengyong, Fuchang, Yuanheng, and others sold off one after another. The foreign exchange market also suffered. One-month British gold could be settled at 174.375, and Xingye and Huabi mutually traded US dollars at 39.5 yuan. Zhongfu and Shanghai did British gold at 17.5. Therefore, at 10:00, it only totaled 683.45 taels. Later, the Zhengjin Bank bought one-month British gold at 174.375, and Yuan Maoyong, Yongfeng, Taihengyuan, Tongtaichang, and others took advantage of the drop to buy in, pulling it up by more than two taels. At 10:30, it was 685.89 taels. After that, there was a slight fluctuation of a few cents. Around 11:00, news continued to come from Japan that Hamaguchi was in critical condition. As a result, various firms felt psychologically unstable, and the situation worsened to the point of despair. Zhifengyong, Shunli, Wanxing, and others bravely sold off, causing a violent storm. In half an hour, it plummeted by more than four taels. One-month British gold was still settled at 174.375. By 11:30, it suddenly dropped to 681.2 taels. After that, there was a fluctuation of one or two taels. HSBC once ate one-month British gold at 174.375, and it had already risen to 682.56 taels. However, the sellers did not relent. At noon closing, it only totaled 681.4 taels. It was then made to 682.5 taels again, and then dropped to 682 taels, causing utter chaos. The announced price had been changed to 618.6 taels. Because the Japanese gold rate was a small one cent down, it was initially suppressed to 31.2 taels, and later to 37 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Highs and Lows Overlapping, Still a Drop of Two Taels: The after-market opened at 82.8 taels (with a profit margin of two to three taels). Later, as the Indian exchange rate rose, it dropped to 82.2 taels. Afterward, news came that Hamaguchi was not dead, and the market seemed to calm down. In reality, it was due to the swap relationship. Sellers were restrained and dared not sell lightly, fearing that the short sellers would lose heavily. As a result, Yu Da, Fuchang, Yuan Chengyong, and others bought in. Sumitomo also bought one tael and 0.2525 of Dalian gold in December, and HSBC bought one-month British gold at 174.375, so it had been raised by more than three taels, to 856,700 at 3:00. Afterward, retail investors sold off, reaching 848,900 at 3:30. Subsequently, there was another peak, because the various firms had already started doing swaps. Initially, it was four or five taels, and then it rose to six or seven taels. In a short time, the wind rose and the clouds surged, and it was estimated to have risen by two taels and several cents. After 4:00, it even reached 87.6 taels. By the closing at 4:30, it was 87.3 taels, a drop of one tael and two cents compared to the previous day. The highest price of the day was 88.6 taels, and the lowest price was 81.2 taels, a fluctuation of 7.4 taels. The announced price was suppressed from 36 taels to more than 31 taels on the ledger. The morning and afternoon markets had double-closing prices, from 90 taels to 81 taels in the morning, and from 95 taels to 86 taels in the afternoon. The water replenishment was nine taels, the goods were eight taels in the morning market, two taels at noon closing, three taels in the afternoon, and 2.2 taels at the closing.</p>
<p>▲ Complex Ins and Outs, Lacking a Target: Among the peer transactions, Yuan Maoyong, Bingxing, Hengxing, Taixing, Dadecheng, and Taihengyuan all bought in. Yongfeng, Taikangrun, Tongtaichang, and Wanxing had mixed ins and outs. Zhifengyong, Shunli, Yu Da, Yuan Chengyong, Xieyu, and Fuyu all sold out. In the afternoon, Fuchang, Yuan Chengyong, Yu Da, Shunli, Wanxing, and Taihengyuan all bought in, while the sellers were retail investors. The Dalian gang initially sold 2,000 bars, then bought 700 bars. In the after-market, they bought 1,000 bars and sold 300-400 bars. The Guang gang bought in a small amount, it is said.</p>
<h3>Continued Slack in Foreign Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silver prices all rebounded, while British and American exchange rates fell. The Kobe market was unchanged. HSBC's listed exchange rates have all increased by half a point.

German exchange increased by one yuan, totaling 162 marks 5. Hong Kong was still counted as 82 taels. Japanese gold then listed a drop of one cent, totaling 12.825825 yuan. As for the internal market of banks, it initially appeared to be short of funds, and later there were slight changes. It then fell again at noon, and was peaceful in the afternoon. However, the price of gold was stormy, and there were ups and downs of more than seven taels throughout the day, which was really due to the assassination of Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi. As a result, the market atmosphere was extremely confusing. In the end, it was still low. It is estimated that the closing prices of various exchange rates increased by 0.0625 for British gold, increased by 0.25 for US dollars, and decreased by 1.25 for Japanese gold compared to the previous day. There were various transactions among Chinese merchants, with both inflows and outflows. It is estimated that more than 200,000 pounds of British gold were traded. Banks such as McGarrett, Mitsui, and HSBC all sold, but the Zhengjin Bank had a very strong buying appetite. Anda Taiwan and HSBC also absorbed some. Various banks also traded 100,000 pounds with each other. British and American tobacco companies also settled their accounts. As for US dollars, various banks traded more than 200,000 yuan with each other, and Chinese merchants also bought 100,000 yuan. Sumitomo also sold.

<h3>Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market Showing Slight Strength</h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly firmer, with actual sales being more active. Demand from Sichuan merchants is relatively strong, but as the season gradually enters a lull, it is difficult to expect yarn sales to be robust, so most people have a bearish outlook. The Chaozhou short sellers are mostly adopting a wait-and-see attitude. According to some, the Sichuan merchants still have several thousand bales to trade, as three ships are scheduled to depart for Yichang, Chongqing, and other places soon.</p>
<p>The benchmark yarn rose by 45 cash. The opening price of the benchmark yarn in the morning session fell by 56 cash due to the downward trend of American cotton and sluggish market sentiment. In the second and third sessions, the price of raw cotton rose, market sentiment was shaken, and the market suddenly strengthened. As a result, the price of each month rose by 3, 4, 5, and 7 cash. In the afternoon, the market situation was slightly calmer, with each month falling by 12 cash. The total transaction volume for the day was 9,600 bales. It was found that the number of bales sold by Gongtai was 550, Yuantai 450, Yudai 450, Senkang 500, Heshen 400, and the remaining 2300 bales. The number of bales bought by Dafeng was 1,250, Changfeng 450, and the remaining 3500 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Has a Short Squeeze Trend</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending upward. Although American cotton has turned downward, the local market sentiment is firmer, and buyers are more aggressive. The momentum for a short squeeze is quite strong, so even though foreign cotton has fallen, most people are still buying, resulting in a tighter market. However, some merchants from Hubei are taking the opportunity to sell in large quantities, about 10,000 dan. However, the current demand for cotton from various factories is still sluggish, and Indian cotton is taking the opportunity to sneak in. The future direction still depends on the changes in American cotton.</p>
<p>▲ Hubei Benchmark Market Dry The opening price of the Hubei benchmark market in the morning session fell by 1.5 cash due to the downward trend of American cotton and flat market sentiment. In the second and third sessions, the buying interest was strong, and the bulls increased their bets, and the price of each month rose by 12 cash again. In the afternoon, the Hubei merchants dumped their holdings, and although the market was tight, the prices were flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 59,200 dan. It was found that Shenchang sold 9,000 dan, Minghua 3,200 dan, Tongchang 2,400 dan, Jinfeng 2,400 dan, Yuanda 2,000 dan, and the remaining 1,5600 dan. Rongxing bought 6,000 dan, Dafu 3,800 dan, Hengyi 3,900 dan, Gongtai 4,100 dan, Yuchang 4,000 dan, and the remaining 1,3800 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left.

<h3>World Cotton Yarn Market Weak, More Soft Than Firm</h3>
<p>▲ US cotton Southern selling weakens. Yesterday, US cotton was initially weak due to bad news from Liverpool, then rebounded strongly due to strong support from Wall Street, and finally weakened again due to Southern selling.

British cotton futures rose by 12 points, spot prices rose by 9 points, Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points, and the Indian cotton market was weak.

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Mixed, Some Firm and Some Weak</h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei Yesterday, the goods from various merchants arrived around the 20th. Sales on this street vary. High-quality new japonica rice still opens at 15 yuan, while medium-quality and lower-quality rice are both weak by 2 jiao. The trend is unfavorable due to the disposal of stagnant inventory. Sales of thin rice are increasingly weak, falling back by 3 jiao. Top-quality rice only opens at 14 yuan and 8 jiao. High-quality Yangxian and Duxian rice are firm and stable. Ordinary rice is seeing good demand from customers, rising by 12 jiao. The market is particularly strong. The tip of the port is good, rising by 1 jiao. High profit is 12 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 fen. The situation is tight due to scarce goods. Bianyuan is short by 2 jiao. Transactions are few. The top price opens at 15 yuan and 2 jiao. Yinyuan is falling sharply. According to this year's late merchants, the quality of Yinhua products is very poor, so buyers are not greedy, and the market is falling step by step. Currently, top-quality rice only opens at 12 yuan. The market situation for each stall throughout the day is very different. Japonica rice is weak, while indica rice is uniquely strong.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai South Yesterday, the river had a lot of goods arriving, with more than 30 merchants. The sales floor is still not expanding. Top-quality white japonica rice is again short by 23 jiao, and special japonica rice is very scarce. Currently, the highest price opens at 14 yuan and 56 jiao. Sutong white japonica rice is also gradually falling. Urban and rural sales are watching, and prices are continuing to fall. The top quality is barely opening at 13 yuan, and the general market is 12 yuan and 5 jiao. The southern merchants' thin rice is showing signs of collapse. As the goods arrive, the sales floor is stagnant, so the bottom goods are gradually filled, and buyers are cutting prices. The special high price here opens at 13 yuan and 5 jiao. Yangxian rice is scarce in supply, and the zero sales of Dujian rice are eager, but the market is stable to soft, and prices are slightly down by about 1 jiao. Yinhua has again fallen sharply, and the ordinary bulk price has already opened at 12 yuan inside the customs.</p>
<h3>Beiyang Merchants Smoothly Handle Passenger Rice</h3>
<p>▲ Xiangxian rice has a slight new arrival</p>
<p>Yesterday, passenger Xian rice was unable to move due to the rejection of merchants in Xiamen and other places. The street was also not selling well, and the market was even more sluggish. Although the arrival of goods yesterday was reduced due to the unprofitability of transportation, it is difficult to expect a good situation due to excessive stagnation in sales. Yesterday, the Tongshi market had some households and rural households handling 1,000 bags of Nanjing machine rice at a price of 10 yuan and 1 jiao, 10 yuan, and down to 9 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen. In addition, 50 bags of Hunan machine oil rice arrived, priced at 12 yuan. Xiangxian rice has no source for a long time due to the high cost. The 50 bags of machine oil tested this time are still difficult to make a profit. However, passenger Yuan is still welcomed by local passengers. The 810 bags of Hunan machine Yuan newly arrived yesterday were all handled by Beiyang merchants, but most of the goods were of medium quality, opening at 14 yuan and 3 jiao, 13 yuan and 4 jiao and 5 fen, and down to 13 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Falls Sharply and Recovers Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened, the prices of each month fell one after another. In this month, due to the arrival of foreign wheat from small and medium-sized factories, buyers were afraid that there would be a huge amount of sales and dumping, so they rushed to sell as soon as the market opened, and the market immediately saw a tragic fall. The prices of distant months also mostly followed suit, but there was only a change of 1 fen. This month, however, fell madly by more than 2 fen. In the afternoon, some shorts entered the market, and this month recovered by a few fen. Distant months also followed suit by a few li. At the close, this month was still down by 1 fen and 25 li, December was down by 5 li, January was down by 2.5 li, and February was down by 2.5 li. March and April each fell by 2.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Tired and Lifeless</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat market opened, both the upper and lower markets were sluggish and unbearable. In fact, after the arrival of two ships of foreign wheat the day before, the market sentiment had already been shaken, and some factories were eager to sell, so there was no hope of a turnaround in the market. At the close in the afternoon, this month was down by 3 fen, next month was down by 1 fen, January was down by 2 fen, February was down by 1 fen, March was unchanged, and April was down by 1 fen. The intake of goods from various factories on the spot was sluggish, and the Tongshi market only recovered 300 bags of wheat at a price of 4 taels and 1 qian and 5 fen, which was also 5 fen weaker than the previous market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Raw Sugar and White Sugar Sold 2,000 Bags</h3>
<p>▲ Tomorrow will arrive ··· Price up to 7 taels, 6 qian, and 2.5 fen</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegram showed that the price of Cuban current sugar was still 1.46875. The price of New York sugar for December was 1.40, down 2 fen from the previous telegram. The price for March next year was 1.53, May was 1.61, and September was 1.73, with only May rising by 1 fen from the previous month, and the remaining months unchanged. The price of Java current sugar and sugar for November and December was 7.9375, and the price for January next year was 8.00, which was still unchanged from the previous month. The association's trading was sparse. There was a surge in the demand for Dutch sugar and 24-grade raw white sugar, but the buying interest was very low. Although a small number of transactions were made, the price was 7 taels and 7 qian, and the market was sluggish. Fine white sugar was 7 taels and 8 qian, and 20-grade medium white sugar was 6 taels and 8 qian, but the demand was also rare. The import and export of Japanese sugar was sparse. The price of N mark was still 7 taels and 7 qian, J mark was 8 taels, YT mark was 7 taels and 6 qian and 5 fen, YRO mark was 7 taels and 2 qian, and then to 7 taels and 1 qian and 7.5 fen, and TM mark was 7 taels and 2 qian. The market was also weak. Huaxin Company sold 2,000 bags of raw white sugar arriving tomorrow at a price of 7 taels, 6 qian, and 2.5 fen. The market was also very depressed.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods, New Sea Vermicelli Has Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ The cost is more expensive than before</p>
<p>There are not many new sea vermicelli this year. According to the letter, there are only 560 mentions in total. Several mentions have been shipped to Shanghai the day before, which are the top-quality Yuanmei brand, and are sold by Jiaodalai Company. The samples have been seen yesterday, and the color is fresh and green, but the cost is more expensive than before, so it is planned to increase the price. However, the market has been flat recently, and customers are only offering the original price. The price in the market rose by 5 qian yesterday, and only a few transactions were made.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Foreign Firms, Silk Sales Are Lonely and Lifeless</h3>
<p>Since the major changes in the French financial sector, the silk market of foreign firms in Shanghai has stagnated, and actual sales have suddenly stopped. Although American firms have intakes of white factories, the overseas prices are surprisingly small, and the difference between the firm and the silk is more than 200 taels, making it difficult to sell. The telegrams of Sichuan dried second warp are also rare, and the market is lonely and lifeless. Yesterday, only Samsung entered 20 bales of HK brand head 234 Mianyang yellow coarse silk at a price of 415 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Cocoon Price is Falling</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai silk factories all suspended business, the Shanghai silk factory cocoon market has suddenly risen sharply. Production has stopped, and the owners are hoarding goods. The market price has risen by 34 taels. The market price of high-quality goods has opened at 26 taels, and the sellers are still unwilling to sell easily. Recently, as the silk factories have resumed work one after another, customers are watching, and the silk factory cocoon market has gradually become weak. The market price of high-quality goods yesterday only opened at 24 taels, and no one has purchased it. The market price is still trending downward.</p>
<h3>Gongxi Green Tea's Russian Sales Turn Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Russian firms of Gongxi green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi and other places were assisting the association and the intake was getting stronger, and the total turnover of the city was more than 2,000 boxes, and the selling price was unchanged from the previous one. It was found that the current inventory of Gongxi is only more than 10,000 boxes, and the teas from Japan and India have all increased costs due to the high price of gold, and it is impossible to sell to Russia. Therefore, the sales of Gongxi green tea and Qining black tea, which are sold to Russian firms, are still unlimited in the future. Unfortunately, the market is manipulated by its sole proprietor, and tea merchants are still inevitably losing money.</p>
<h3>Broadcloth, Cotton Flannel Trend is Unique</h3>
<p>The broadcloth market was still depressed yesterday, and the prices of most goods fell. Only cotton flannel rose suddenly due to the lack of spot goods. Fuhua bright red sold for 1 qian, 9 fen and 2.5 li, Tori Beauty bright red for 1 qian and 9 fen, and Fuhua concubine color was sold out at 1 qian and 8 fen and 5 fen. Yesterday, Tori Beauty also needed 1 qian and 8 fen and 5 fen, Fuhua foreign blue for 2 qian and 1 fen, and Lovely Beauty chic green for 2 qian and 1 fen and 5 fen. In addition to this street, Tianjin also has a search for goods. After inspection, there may be a temporary stall. The rise of colorful striped flannel is also fierce. The reason is that the sales of Japanese street store have been greatly excited, and the stock is in short supply. The Osaka order must arrive in January next year, so the market sentiment is unusually strong. Yesterday, it was sold to 6 taels and 89 qian. Except for this, it can be said that it is completely depressed. Fine serge, moon flower velvet, straight tribute satin, gray light oblique, are still trending downward. Checkered tribute, new flower straight tribute wool, and printed flannel are even more depressed.</p>
<h3>Oil Market, White Tung Oil Regains Depressed Trend</h3>
<p>The West Tung market is trending down again. The market price in the production area is 23 yuan and 6 jiao, paid in Jiangxi. The selling price in this city is 27 yuan. The external market in Wuhan is slightly weaker due to the rumors that a large batch of Xiang Tung will arrive, and it is slightly declining again. The external market is opening at 16 taels and 4 qian. It is found that foreign sales are still difficult to develop, and Chen You cannot be dredged, and the tung trees in the production area have reported a bumper harvest, and the price of the seeds has fallen, with each burden pulling the price of 8 yuan. The spot goods from the oil mills in various provinces are being sold one after another, resulting in an increase in oil stocks in Hanzhao, Hangzhou, Shanghai and other places. Looking at the overall trend, the oil market is still difficult to develop.</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>

They commonly use ordinary straw paper, which is rough and inferior, not only extremely uncomfortable but also harmful to hygiene, leading to various diseases over time. There have been few reforms, allowing imported products to take the opportunity to enter the market. Although upper-class women mostly use them, their prices are very high and not affordable for the general public. Now, our company has newly manufactured a kind of Women's Sanitary Paper. The paper is fine, soft, clean, and very easy to absorb moisture. It is also sterilized and formulated to benefit hygiene. The price is also extremely low, and it is suitable for ordinary women.
