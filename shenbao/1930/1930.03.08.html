<p>監視後、即晚函請市長崔廷獻援救、崔於次晨覆函稱、傅司令向以忠厚待人、此次奉命辦理、迫於不得已而爲之、請放寛心、决無危險、魯接函後、又函請崔設法恢復自由、靜候澈查、是日下午遂能接見來賓、自是市黨部人員、走避一空、僅宣傳部組織部訓練部民訓會秘書處、各留不負責任之雇員一二人看守文件而已、公安局長曾延毅於下午四時赴市黨部召集留守人員談話、略稱魯部長被扣、是個人問題、不是黨務問題、也不是社會局問題、請大家安心服務、照舊負責、現在雖有人來接洽接收市黨部、但非有確實之根據、不能交出、然縱有確實之根據、而無閻總司令之命令、則無論何人前來接收、一槪拒絶制止、隨諭令五區三所對市黨部門禁特别加嚴、來賓一律禁止入内、即内部人員、亦須有徽章方准出入、晚間第八區黨部散放傳單、痛詆組織部長陳石泉把持選舉、當時謠傳、陳在車站被捕、嗣經調查不確、</p>
<p>市長崔廷獻、二十七晚下手諭委市政府秘書長馮司直代理社會局局長、又提升技正劉晋暄爲秘書處帮辦、馮於二十八日下午三時赴社會局視事、並召集各科人員訓話、略稱本人係代理性質、望大家安心照舊服務、</p>

<h3>魯省整委劉漣漪被刺</h3>
<p>四日下午五點、魚省整委會員兼組織部長劉漣漪、在趵突泉東國立靑島大學籌備處内被刺、緣省整委會此次調各縣黨部人員來省訓話、到一百餘人、即假靑島大學籌備處上班、是日劉氏在該班上班、五點下班外出、甫出訓練班敎室東南角小門、見小門外操塲内、學員正在打球、不料門外先有兩人、一人作暸望勢、一人即向劉猛擊兩槍、中劉腰部、當即倒地</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>、斯時操塲内學生驚慌大喊、兇手乘勢從容逸去、劉之隨從、即打電話到各處報告、該管城外一區公安分局長閔警先至、省政府省整委會市黨部等、各黨政機關要人、均往看視、一面令公安局與警備司令部速緝兇手、一面用汽車送劉往濟南醫院醫治、七點鐘時、捕獲該訓練班學員翟毓淸、翻出手槍一枝、認有重大嫌疑、當送往總指揮部嚴訊、翟係陽穀縣人、至劉到濟南醫院後、即在外科施用手術、據組織部秘書劉鍾明談、劉部長腰部中兩槍、自後向前、槍彈係勃郎寗式、而翟毓淸之槍、則非勃郎寗、又云劉之傷勢頗重、危險期尙未過、槍彈由後面穿腰部而出、落於衣内、</p>
<h3>福州錢莊兌現問題</h3>
<p>錢莊公帮議定救濟辦法</p>
<p>市塲重要時期穏健渡過</p>
<p>福州通訊、本市錢莊所發行之大洋票、前因省政府令其直接兌現、缺少準備現金、恐生擠兌風潮、擬將大洋　　通額逐漸減少、另發一種虚本位、　　票或商銀票、以爲舖家間轉賑之用、社會以其紊亂幣制、妨害金融、羣起反對、現此項虚本位之銀兩票、已經省政府圜法委員會、下令禁止、並着錢莊、（一）此後發行之鈔票、仍應以大洋爲本位、（二）此項大洋票、應一律直接兌現、（三）以鈔票兌換現洋、不得要求貼水及申水、錢莊鑒於社會形勢之激昂、與官廳態度之嚴厲、不得遵照辦理、取銷銀兩票之提議、照舊發行小洋票、並於三月一日起、實行直接兌現、大洋價格、每元本較大洋票高四五十文、故以票換洋、向須貼水、現亦逐漸降落、與鈔票同價、惟以各家錢莊所有準備現金、不足供給商塲需要鈔票鉅額之用、若均發行大洋票、則同時兌現問題、又難解决、特由錢莊公帮議定兩種救濟辦法、（一）大洋票僅出一元二元三元五元十元五種、以爲流通市面之用、其舖家向錢莊拔票以爲轉賑之用者、則另發一種整數百元起碼之大洋白條、仍行歸枰兌現、（即持票人不能直接向本店兌現、惟商家欠錢莊票欵者、可以此項白條抵還、由各家錢莊自行兌換）（三）請官廳此後徴收捐稅、與給發新餉、槪用現洋、本國中央中國兩銀行、外國匯豐台灣兩銀行、所有營業上出入、當用現洋、各錢莊買賣港滬匯票、亦用現洋、一律不得收受大洋票、藉减流通、現圜法委員會對此兩議、正在核議中、此外尙有一事與金融大有關係者、即本市小洋價格、每枚向値八十文以上、自省政府在馬江銀元局、開鑄雙毫輔幣後、小洋價格、即隨之日落、現每枚僅値七十五文、且不能立住、小民生計大受影響、據云係成色低劣所致、昨圜法委員會已議决、呈請省政府將該輔幣公開化騐、以昭大信、</p>
<p>至本市商塲狀况、則因自舊臘底各途行棧、以兌現風潮、銀根吃緊、週轉不靈、相繼倒閉、總數約達二百萬元左右、其中以錢商放欵、損失最鉅、本届廢歷二月初二日、又爲商塲始業倒業重要過渡之時期、各貨棧商東鑒於市面蕭條、預防各店舖該期或有猛烈搖動風潮、先期特令各途仲人、分赴各舖户、切實磋商、無論如何、總以極力維持現狀爲第一要着、不可輕易放棄、出此店閉人逃之下策、如果到期乏欵、各行棧願减收賑額、俟過此初二期後、再圖陸續彌補、庶不致血本全歸鳥有、店方亦不致基礎倒坍、並以該期過後、錢商方面、舊欠得有着落、新摺可以再發、千鈞一髮、全繫於此、各途店商亦以行商旣肯通融、生機藉免中斷、故是日本市商况、遂得穏健渡過也、（三月三日）</p>

<h3>工部局選出外董後所聞</h3>
<p>英美籍讓　問題</p>
<p>安諾德辭職原因</p>
<p>某日人發表意見</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、自本届工部局外董選舉揭曉英籍占六名　美籍僅占一名後、外間即有英籍新董將辭去一人以便美籍次多數遞補之說但昨據深知工部局情形者言、此事在英董方面苟能有益於公衆、至少將有一人願自動辭職以讓美人、惟就目下情形而論究能成爲事實與否、正猶難言、且聞尙未提出董事會　加以正式討論云、又據美橋某要人表示、此議在英人方面　固屬運動家風度、讓德可風、若在美人、則接受此議、未免斷然失去運動家風度、至美籍此次僅有一人當選之故、實因候選者有三人、票數旣分、遂致兩人落選、又據工部局某君言、在本年之内、或者有一英董因故辭職　則斯時大約將以美人補缺云、</p>
<p>英人安諾德辭去總董後　昨致函各西報發表落選及辭職原因、略謂、渠以身在總董　對於日人要求之大增日捕、及其他事件、未能全允、因此在選舉前數日間即預知渠在六百日籍選民中、僅能獲得二百票　設選舉結果誠若所料、則西人投渠之票、當有五百十餘張、渠聞日籍選民有百分之九十前往投票英籍則不過百分之五十、若英僑長此放棄選舉權則外董選舉自將爲日僑所左右、但此次旣有多數新人物営選後　或者市民將能較前注意於市政也、渠在任内、改良市辦醫院及護士制、改善中西捕生活狀况、澈底改粗華人敎育處　在工部局聯員中開始汰除老朽、擢用英後、設法逐漸增雇華員　並組織薪水委員會考慮薪水問題、此外組織局員恊會　以期恊調董事會與局員間之關係　改良全部敎育</p>
<p>制度、使中外子弟獲有均等機會　力主聘請專家、調查電話、並堅拒華洋德律風公司接受美資本團合同之請、囑其公開投標　又如融洽中外感情　及派費信悙赴西京出席太平洋會議與聘費唐顧問等　皆一年來犖犖大端、今選民旣不贊成此種政策、渠若再於今後數星期中傾導製定本年度新政策、將不無令董事會感有爲難之處、故此先期引退云云、</p>
<p>文匯報訪員會謁見本埠有聲望之日籍納稅人某氏、談及安睰德在各西報所發表之函該日員否認日僑曾於選舉之前派定票數之說、又謂安氏政見　旣不爲日僑所滿意、何以又予以二百票乎　且日人斷無若是之愚、以欲排斥其所不滿之人預示其人况增加日捕、乃屬細事　若謂因此血影響於選舉　豈非笑談　聞增加日捕之提議、並非出於日籍議董　議增之日捕　已照原議由日運來矣、該日員並對於一部分報紙運動英籍議董讓出一席　俾落選之美籍某氏得以遞補一節有所指摘、謂此舉足以引起悲感云、</p>

<h3>浦東洋棧警權一律收回</h3>
<p>太古大來等已次第收回</p>
<p>英美議定分期收回辦法</p>
<p>市公安局第三區長張鳴欽、前以浦東沿浦一帶各外商廠棧、雇用巡丁或印捕、殊屬妨碍警權、且去年某棧發生工潮時、看門印捕竟任意槍傷工人、故一再呈請袁局長嚴重交涉、務期將各廠棧警權一律收回、以資劃一系統、除重要之太古·大來·大阪·安利·隆茂·亞細亞·等各洋棧警權、已次第收回外、茲悉陸家嘴英美烟公司當局、亦已尊重我國命令、議妥分期收回辦法、先後將原有巡丁、調換請願警察、駐廠保護、茲將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>交涉經過情形</p>
<p>英美烟公司計有兩廠及一堆棧、範圍廣大、共雇華人巡丁六十四名之　、其數爲沿浦各廠棧冠、分駐棧内守護、並聘請前淞滬第三區警察署署長解恩挂主特管理之職、不受當地警局指揮、經三區張區長查核情形、詳報總局、一面親自與該公司總大班　蘭脫（譯音）迭次交涉、並經英美工會從中援助、因别有波瀾、延未解决、張區長以收回警權、事關重要、不能聽憑外人拒絶、故於上月二十八日復進廠交涉、並將巡丁應行調換請願警之意義、反覆解釋、磋商良久、該大班始允將警權交還於我國、議妥分期收回辦法、次第實行、該公司因不允我國收回警權、致醞釀許久、至今方告一段落、</p>
<h3>分期收回辦法</h3>
<p>張區長與該公司</p>
<p>當局議妥收回警權之辦法、共分三期、第一期爲本月十六日、先將堆棧内之巡丁、一律調歸區内、另抽該區得力長警、前往駐棧保護、第二期爲四月一日、將老廠巡丁調換警察、第三期爲四月十六日、調換新廠巡丁爲警察、該三處巡丁調換警察完畢後、即將所派警察、一律按照市公安局請願警暫行章程辦理、至於原有巡丁本兩人一崗、則加派一人爲三警一崗、而時間本爲站崗六時、休息六時、亦改爲站崗三時、休息六時、並將警察分爲三班、假定甲班値崗、則乙班休息、兩班訓練、以此循環而均勞逸、</p>
<h3>長官已經委定</h3>
<p>該公司原有巡丁主任解恩桂、張區長以其曾充地方警察長官多年、警務頗爲熟悉、故呈由公安局加委爲三區請願警區員、仍駐廠服務、按照市公安局官員薪餉發給、復添巡官一員、專司内外勤及一切敎育事宜、現公安局已委定該區户籍巡官崔鑄調充之、聞該巡官係北平高等警官學校畢業、歷任公安分局長等要職、對於警務學識、頗有經騐、</p>
<h3>商妥後之餘聞</h3>
<p>該項分期收回警</p>
<p>權辦法、旣經商妥、現公司方面對於請願警第一批之服裝費、亦已繳呈三區、轉呈市公安局存候趕辦制服、而原有巡丁、本爲六十四名、現張區長以該公司規模較大、已計劃照數改換警察後、並增多二十名、共爲八十四名、以厚實力、至於調回區内之原有巡丁、由市公安局派員考騐分别去留後、將及格者一律穿着警察制服、改編爲警察、派赴各地站崗、藉資訓練、而該區將多數警察派赴英美公司後、除以巡丁抵補缺額外、不足由市公安局敎練所補充之、</p>

<h3>張殷控訴問題</h3>
<p>又傳屍弟蘇耀亭到案詰問曰、汝前遞一狀、除控訴本案四被告外、尙加控張文卿之妹夫殷榮源·及妹張文培·二人、但並無證據提出、將來恐無良好結果、現汝究竟控告否、蘇答一定控告、捕房汝律師即起立聲明、捕房已經控告四被告、而對於張文培·殷榮源·二人、因無證據、故不起訴、現屍屬旣自行具狀起訴、則對於本案進行及是否併案訊理、應請先行裁决、羅君核供、以屍屬旣已起訴、當然不能强行制止、但對於本案進行及併案各節、係另一問題、惟本推事很希望屍屬方面對於張文培·殷榮源、兩人撤回告訴、而原告律師即聲明該訴狀、係根據當事人之意思投遞、至於證據方面、則不明瞭、容退庭後再與當事人商議後、究竟有無充分證據、再行定核、</p>
<h3>衣服甚爲華麗</h3>
<p>又由張文卿之代理律師王　裳向陳恒才詰問云、你曾否耳聞死者欲謀害張文卿、陳答當時聞大小姐張文卿云、若訟案勝訴、則我性命難保、又問、死者每一星期在家數天、答祗一二天在家、平日死者出外衣服頗爲華麗、穿粉紅綢旗袍等詞、該律師並向張文卿詢問死者平日品行如何、張答頗不規矩、輙數日不歸、訊至此、羅推事以此案尙有改期之必要、遂諭四被告仍分别還押、改期本月十七號下午再訊、</p>

<p>滬江固以籃球名於一時、自何通受傷、中鋒乏人、軍心不無憂急、且遠道傳聞、彼金陵本届實力雄壯、不可一世、故在開戰之初、何通依然入場、奮勇作戰、迨至上半時告終、滬江已勝利在握、乃改調副將、自行退出、何之表演自難及往昔之神化　然張本軍之威風、奪敵人之氣魄、其一身出入關係甚巨也、梁國權靈巧活潑、爲全塲冠、至其得分之多、接濟之佳、固無人能出其右、歐陽永源邇來漸露頭角、士别三日、刮目相視、歐陽足當此語矣、汪鵬之内衛、妙在剛柔並用、攻守兼顧、孫澤民之投擲自創一格、確有獨到之處、其餘諸人尙能盡其厥職、而全隊合作之佳妙、尤令人呌絶、總之、滬江獲勝之故有三一個人盡職、二合作佳妙、三塲地熟、勁敵相逢、三者有其一二、已足制敵取勝、况全有其三乎、金陵球員、身魄魁梧、精神飽滿、當其卓立塲中英姿颯爽、大有暗鳴叱咤不可一世之雄慨、惜乎個人之實力有餘、全隊之合作欠佳、遂至相形見拙、失利而退、前鋒凌惠揚出没全塲、能攻能守、全隊中之柱石也、中鋒凃鐘前後兼顧、擲傳得當、亦一危險人物、其餘諸人、瑜瑕互見、其最大病根由於動作緩慢也、然資質均佳、假以時日、予以訓練、不日當可橫掃千軍也、</p>
<h3>談球戰高下懸殊</h3>
<p>宣戰之令已下、雙方開始行動、金陵猛力進撲、聲勢極壯、滬江軍心恐惶、頗有侷促之勢爲首破二隊之紀錄者乃金陵惠揚、繼中者滬江汪今鵬、旋何通歐陽各罰中一分、未幾成七比五局面、其時滬江　占先者、但全軍進退、未見精彩立時休戰、男籌良計、再度聲中、果有成效、從此全軍手臂相連、縱橫一時、金陵努力加鞭、無濟於事、上半時二十六比十、滬江占先、下半時中、滬江戰將屢換、球勢仍盛、金陵屈於威力之下、反身不易、有一時凃鐘琦連獲三球、形勢轉佳、但强駑之末、爲力有限、故不久又墮落不起矣、比賽結果五十二比十八、滬江大勝　裁判員徐振東、</p>

<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>醫生—你的病已全愈了。所需要的便是運動。每天你得步行一二里路。并且要有目的。病人—醫士。我一定照你的話做去。每天一定步行一二十里。我的目的。就是一家家上親戚故舊的門。借了錢來付你那筆偌大的醫費。</p>
<p>男—吾愛你這般嬌怯。一見了狗就害怕。那麽你見了牛也害怕麽。女（漲紅了臉）—我倒没有這種經騐。因爲我的父親是牛奶房老閭。我見了牛。就好像見了戀人一様。</p>
<p>甲主筆—你這篇文章還須做得淸楚些。怕那些没有智識的人看了不懂。乙主筆—你且指給我看。那一節你看了不懂。</p>
<p>甲—你能借給我一百塊錢麽。只須一禮拜就可奉還。</p>
<p>乙—這幾天我手頭也不便。只有五十塊錢。</p>
<p>甲—那麽就借給我五十塊錢。不過須延至兩禮拜奉還了。這是你自己不好。</p>
<h3>美人口中之甘地</h3>
<p>— 志政</p>
<p>美國著名社會學家培琪氏來華。先後在靑年會演講、頗得一般人士之歡迎。一昨交通大學亦延氏蒞校。所講爲印度聖人甘地氏事。對甘地備極贊揚爰就所憶。略記如次。</p>
<p>甘地之狀貌。培琪云。甘地氏身裁矮小。體重不滿一百磅。衣服極不講究。貌亦平常。每日不啖食及蔬菜。所食者。水菓數件而已。</p>
<p>蓋世偉人氏云。甘地早歲求學於英。歸國後執行律師業務。某日。代表當事人出庭辯護。詎知發言時竟一再呑吐。終至面紅耳赤而下台。其當時被窘可知。經此刺激。乃益潛心向學。甘地氏者。以其一生之事業論。實爲一大政治家。一社會改革家。一聖人。兼此三者。可不謂爲蓋世之偉人耶。</p>
<p>印度小寡婦　印度人民。早婚成俗。子女四五歲即令結婚。丈夫死後。不論妻子之年齡若何。不得再嫁。職是之故。印度女子。四五歲之爲小寡婦者。頗不乏人。摧殘女子之幸福。至於此極。甘地大聲疾呼。喚起人民對此事之注意。迄今此風已稍殺云。</p>
<p>非武力抵抗之勢力　非武力抵抗。爲甘地所獨創。某年英政府令印人繳騐指印。甘地令衆勿往。被逮者數千人。牢獄人滿。當局大恐。衆印人釋放後。仍不往繳。英人卒無可如何也。甘地主張之對英消極抵抗。尤着重經濟絶交。故英人在印之勢力。頗受甘地氏之打擊。今則甘地竟以哀的美敦書致印督。實行其非武力抵抗。其聲勢蓋可知矣。</p>
<p>他山之石　氏演說畢。衆報以熱烈之掌聲。夫甘地以一亡國之民。領導羣衆。以不合作主義而實行經濟絶交。卒使英屈服。陷於次殖民地之我國人聞之。又烏得無動於中耶。培琪氏之講此。殆寓有深意焉。</p>
<h3>記賣解的女盜</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>老僕亞賜。自湖州來。見余謂湖行大不易。蓋時至今日。盗匪遍地。由滬至湖。向有直達輪船。乃一月之前。遭刦數次。膽怯者視爲畏途。改乘滬杭車至嘉興、復乘輪抵湖。計程較捷。不意此嘉興班。亦於前旬被掠。損失頗重、荆棘滿途。言之心驚。亞賜鄉居。密邇太湖、言及太湖女盜二人。凶悍絶倫。所鎭或可信也。</p>
<p>太湖港渠交錯　非熟於路徑者不辦。歷年多有盜匪嘯聚其間。大都爲湖南帮江北帮。茅舍掩映。漁舟隠没。此中最易混跡。不過綠林之雄，均屬壯漢。縱有壓寨夫人。向未出頭露面。迨去年烏靑二鎭。先後受匪蹂躏始見有女匪二人。手提盒子砲。東西指揮。於是居民注目。均謂太湖有女强盜出現矣。據湖濱居民談。女盜年事一約三十餘。一則未滿三十。短裝縛脚。截髮戴帽。長者凶殘可畏。少者面目尙好。昔爲賣解女子。遊行浙蘇交壤。藉滾缸走索。以得纒頭。潯震鄉民。尙有隠約能識者。未知果何由而流爲匪也。女匪趫捷。行走甚速。口操山東音。間亦在太湖中駕舟出没。湖濱漁民。逢之者每指點以爲談助。自浙省當道　嚴密搜剿。該匪踪跡。近已稍歛矣。</p>
<h3>滅鼠新談</h3>
<p>— 嵇覲</p>
<p>前日泰晤士報載有本埠北四川路泰恒里某宅。母孩二人。均爲鼠類嚙傷。嗣經報告衛生局設法搜捕止獲小鼠兩三頭。而大者仍被逃脫。恐爲後患云云。余謂衆之爲患。何地蔑有。從未聞嚙人致重傷者。茲與友人討論滅鼠之術。略誌如下。以告讀者。</p>
<p>考西人滅鼠方法。類不勝舉　大凡商店住户以及往來船舶。每閱三月。須噴射毒瓦斯一次。以免發生核子瘟、金錢癬、鼠瘧、鼠疫種種疾病。固屬盡善。不知鼠性多狡。倐來倐往。不可捉摸。甚至登輪以渡重洋者有之。乘車以適異國者亦有之。最近美國某處飛行機中。常發見小鼠多頭。咄咄怪事。盡人皆知。且其繁殖甚速。一頭雌鼠。每年生育可六次。一次約五六頭。合全世界統計之報告。大小鼠類。目下已有九千餘兆之多。滅不勝滅。將如之何。</p>
<p>據最近西方某雜誌云。英國倫敦、發起一全市滅鼠大會。預定某月某日同時舉行。並用機械噴射一種滅鼠藥水。此種藥水。含有過烈之刺戟性。使鼠聞之。頓時全體發熱。欲死不得。相率紛紛離穴。覓取陰凉。迨至一遇冷氣。其毒即發。立能抽縮而死。斷不至歸穴腐爛。釀成鼠疫。此藥名爲考奇司脫斯Ｃogesters水。係皇家醫院醫生考奇司脫斯氏所發明。故以己名名之。聞試騐有效。行將銷售各國。以使鼠類有滅種之慘云。</p>
<h3>新聯語</h3>
<p>— 來</p>
<p>黎前總統吳夫人日前棄世。前黎之國務總理李根源氏。近正避居蘇之穹窿山中。特製聯寄輓云。「目中誰得似夫人。曾記國事多艱。翟服笄珈勤戒旦。天上若還逢主座。爲道山居無恙。靑燈風雨長相思。」欵署大總統吳夫人靈幃。李根源敬輓云。</p>
<h3>續誌張飛頭</h3>
<p>— 陳叔平</p>
<p>前本刊曾載蜀廟之張飛頭一節。頗爲讀者所注目。咸欲詳悉其眞相。藥商張君永祥。爲人飽經世故。博識誠慤。恂恂有儒者風。全正由蜀來滬。昨宵邂逅席間。不才即以此事就詢。據云。確知傳述。該廟於大殿中央置一巨缸。滿儲生油。所謂張飛之頭。即浸沉其中。髮端綴一細鏈。貫梁間之轆轤而下垂。客欲觀者。先須納香金若干。然後由僧人援鏈出首。但見油紙圍裹一圓形物。大如西瓜。紙上累累者爲官廳之封條。下端微露黑色之戟髯。據髯推想。其狀貌之可怖。自在意料中。僧云。該首昔本公開展覧。俟以環眼燕頷。虎虎若生，孩童見者。輒驚悸成疾。或竟致死。地方長官遂禁止以色相示人。諭令包封。免再肇禍。夫三將軍非世俗奉爲神明者耶。乃其遺體之最要部份。不埋入黃土。而沉浮油中。是褻瀆歟。抑尊敬歟。殊屬一疑問矣。若謂係仿泰西博物院保存辦法。其理由實難成立蓋一則我國習俗。逈異於泰西。素尙入土爲安之見解除明正典刑外。决無高懸其首以示敬仰者。且一世紀前。人民尙乏此種新思想。况又爲交通不便風氣閉塞之川省乎。或曰。此係僧人歛錢之故技。殊無研究之價值。未知然否。深望該地同志能以科學方法。經詳細考察後。作一確切之報告。諒亦讀者所樂聞也。</p>
<p>平按該首級發現已久。其確實年期。雖不可考。然至少時期　當逾百載。故有一世紀前云云。係指該廟供人展覧之日而言。惟何由而爲僧人所得。斯誠一大疑問也。</p>
<h3>製箋漫話</h3>
<p>— 張枕綠</p>
<p>年來從事製箋事業。良晨箋三字。幸能普遍入於人心。相率採用。去歲曾以製箋所得。作製箋漫話。發表本報。日者客來淸譚。製箋是道。午夜引去。驟感岑寂片假記存。以當鴻爪。</p>
<p>工欲善其事。必先利其器。製箋。一微事耳。其字與畫。以免於粗俗爲最低條件。製版無論鋅銅。淸晰爲貴。設用活版排線格。必取亲材、然新鉛線有因緣鋒過銳。輕印不着痕跡。重印或碎薄紙。當以銅線較勝。且復耐用版圍或排書邊。新書邊且有澆製不足而起沙眼者。印出後似露針孔。舊材遑論。或排花邊。或因身坯大小與預算之版幅。過與不及。未能恰如分際。或因對花未能確準。則巧工運其腦思。以求吻合似天衣之無縫。費時遂不資。有線版而拼特製版者。如鋅銅版有木托底。每較版面爲大。版面字畫。印出時遠離線格。又不中式。則巧工又須運其腦思。或銼木底之邊。或剪鉛線之底。或將鉛料縱橫亘列以維繫之。或襯薄紙厚紙以鎭定之。費時遂又不資。版旣矣。印機之良窳。又爲製箋之重要關鍵。墨膠之軟硬漲縮。油墨之厚薄光黯　在在足爲印刷方面之妨礙。又版底高低。機面平線。爲印刷工人之事。印事備矣。紙料之精粗。其能適於此版否。其能適於此墨否。亦須加以考量。紙緣均度。更足以毁全箋之美觀而無餘。故工欲善事。利器必先。器雖利矣。還須工善。製箋。一微事耳。其難如此。百業何莫不然。朱拍廬有言。一絲一縷。恒念物力維艱。誠可念也。</p>
<h3>南豐橘</h3>
<p>— 志政</p>
<p>贛省南豐縣。爲古文家曾子固故鄕。世稱曾曰南豐先生者。亦猶今之段合肥張南通也。南豐</p>
<p>地不繁盛。然「南豐橘」一種。則爲其特産。其形絶微。較之市上所售者僅及其五之一。狀若荷錢。望之生愛。去皮而食。味極甘芳。愈小則味愈妙。以故一食輒盡數十枚。而購此南豐橘之擇其巨者。必反爲識者所笑。該地農民多種此。惟因需求者廣。故南昌以上。即不復可得。遑論潯滬矣。吾友譚君贊華。新歲自贛來申。携有南豐橘一筐。約數百枚。分餉朋儕。喜其别饒風味。因偶話之。</p>

<h3>錢業互軋情勢稍緩</h3>
<p>市場槪况　日前以錢業同行、受拆票多缺懸殊之影響　發現許多危機、昨日形勢　比較前日略緩、然總未能安謐如恒、而市上拆票交易、依舊能通融　好在昨日各莊缺銀者、類率由股東大家現銀墊出維持、始得履險如夷、而交易狀况受此激刺、宜其無正式用途也</p>
<p>厘拆價格　「洋厘」早市爲七錢二分○半厘、午市爲七錢二分○七毫半、趨勢較前優異　而交易亦較上數日略旺「銀拆」始終白借内容因拆票不做進出、市塲中無價可開、惟銀行劃頭、因收欵較多、故有七八分加水、爲今年中唯一之昂價</p>

<h3>紗花時局開展紗市陡昂</h3>
<p>紗市轉堅、漲風較銳、但海外錦市、仍趨下游、良以時局消息良好、致新抛户滅少、而獲利賣方乘機扒空、故市面激昂、形勢較緊、客帮有一部份較爲活動、津帮辦戰驟健、實銷如能接踵而來、尙有二兩之漲風也、</p>

<h3>棉市轉趨穏象</h3>
<p>棉市趨勢尙緊、因買方拉緊不放、逢跌購進加碼、而美棉一味趨向下游、現銷依然岺寂各廠以印棉市價較廉、辦意甚澹、多數均抱觀望態度、棉市情形殊鮮把握也、</p>

<h3>三品取引所最近槪况</h3>
<p>公斷與特殊審定紗花品質</p>
<p>均藉科學化儀器確切解决</p>
<p>大阪三品取引所、以棉紗花期貨之買賣爲主要營業三品者乃三種物品之謂、蓋發起者原擬在此取引所中經營棉花紗棉棉布三種物品之交易也　後來僅有棉紗交易、但在兩年前原棉買賣已復作矣、原棉買賣以八分之七吋　　　　　及標準嚴格矣、特林級ＳuictMidlio四之一担爲基礎、而其單位爲美棉十包（即三十六担）棉紗之標準爲東洋棉廠之二十支金魚牌、乃一九二七年由取引所理事會議定者、每月原由審定委員會審定各廠棉紗之標準品質一次　而决定標準上或標準下之差金加减焉、又如棉花或棉紗標準之决定、意見參差、則取引所置有照科學原理測騐品質之儀器以判定之、若遇公斷時亦用此儀器　該所規則規定棉花或棉紗之期貨買賣得用競賣方法行之、惟特别規定者或認爲必要時可用交割手續、在競賣塲中經紀人須報明價格及所欲買或賣之數量、凡此買賣數量輒暫登人市塲交易册中雙方議價繼續不已、至全部之買賣平均時乃决定成交價格、但同一經紀人所作之買進與賣出、如不特别聲明、則須認爲互相抵銷云、</p>
<h3>糧食米市粳疲秈堅</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日河下來船陸續、北粳走銷甚滯、晨初買氣尙可、旋即趨靜、大盤高定次疲、薄稻在陰雨中交易不多、賣客因防買方勒價、亦不主急售、羊杜秈緣洋米向榮、銷化活絡、兼近到甚稀、同趨堅挺、客埠秈亦然、各價均提升角外之譜、白元平而無神、暫無榮辱、</p>
<p>滬南　河下來船甚接、本街進意不一、常錫蘇同等由粳主顧甚爲客寥寥、約須批降角半左右、市勢極疲、南帮薄早稻市况更弱、連日雖已告短、然不能引起銷塲、價格續疲、羊杜秈亦隨西貢小絞而上、買氣甚佳、行情喊緊角許、通變陰化客路稍有抵埠、市銷淸淡、價呈平庸、</p>
<h3>麵粉盤旋中略帶穏象</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上下午開盤後、各月份大致盤旋、本月份雖實銷未見暢動、惟北方局勢、頗有和平希望、以往例推測、銷塲或可漸漸轉佳、故盤旋之中、略覺穏住、四五月份以人心穏、亦略帶高、至六月份初盤會到過二兩三錢、下午則以天色</p>
<p>轉晴、人心稍軟、至七八月份同屬新粉、難分軒輊、故七月份買氣比較略佳、價亦略挺、觀後步如金融無意外之變端、遠期各月份、在目前當買多于賣也、結果本月份較前日好五厘、四月份不動、五月份好五厘、六月份好五厘、七月份好五厘、八月份未動云、</p>
<h3>標準麥又見步挺</h3>
<p>現貨做開一萬一千包</p>
<p>昨日期麥上下午開盤後、近遠期又見步挺、因洋麥報價雖時有上落、但實際訂購者、究屬寂無所聞、而三四月份究在靑黃時節、雖本埠積存之貨　約在十萬担左右、惟合于交易所之標準者、不及十之二三、因此標準行情、步步見佳、結果本月份及三四月份、較前日收價各好二分、六月份好一分、七月份不動、八月份好一分、現麥高次各檔、仍然趨穏、大小廠家辦胃、日形殷切、開明光麥五兩一錢七分、淸江浦麥五兩一錢六分、安慶麥五兩一錢二分、高郵麥五兩零七分至零五分、邊江麥四兩九錢二分、沙市麥四兩九錢五分、陽州麥五兩一錢至零八分、漢口麥四兩九錢八分至三四分、江西麥五兩零七八分、無錫麥四兩九錢二分、共開一萬一千包、由福新阜豐申大信大等廠辦去云、</p>
<h3>小絞米獨漲二角半</h3>
<p>漢口寗波内地辦胃均活</p>
<p>西貢大絞跟大角外</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况　愈見起色因除内地本街暢辦外　新有漢口與寗紹·温台各帮過問　人心更爲看好　小絞米需要尤殷、價乃激漲至二角半之鉅　其他各米跟好角外、統市開出小絞米近萬包　價十三元七角至三角半、大絞一千五百包、價十三元一角西貢一號一千五百包、價十四元七角半、又二號五百包、價十三元七角、期米去化亦旺、除回籠外、有日新·三井·福嘉等抛出、但行情亦好一二分至五六分不等云、</p>
<h3>五金黑鐵皮廠銷狂猛</h3>
<p>五金交易　邇因市上閙銀根暗緊關係、實際買賣大爲遜色、客帮廠家除切需品有添配外、太宗交易甚爲淸淡、惟獨黑鐵皮交易、昨因廠家（搪瓷廠打包廠）胃口强健　辦胃十分猛烈、緣是市貨被搜告竭、標準漲風甚熾二尺六尺十八張能開至九兩三錢、比上日又高漲一錢半惟市貨則因僧多粥少、供不敷銷、異常堅挺、三尺六尺貨因二尺六尺貨趨勢良佳、亦帶高不少、其間尤以十三張最爲買主所歡迎、價開尤兩二錢半　其餘售九兩交易昨有六七百扎云、</p>
<h3>雜訊</h3>
<p>龍口線粉干近以到貨不多、滬存單薄、目下如福建·内地本街均有採辦、呌盤已達二十二兩半、</p>
<p>日絲銳跌、海外電轉價仍小、華絲商虧本不願賤售、昨祇愼餘進滬白廠經十包、信孚進魯黃廠經二十包、遠昌進白大經五包、</p>
<p>本埠洋行家消息、謂摩洛哥茶市疲滯、</p>
<p>綠茶存底甚豐、去年洋茶商所定珍眉等茶、因價格太高、多遭虧折云、</p>
<p>漳刁靑糖昨到二百餘包、號方様單已出、但尙未開售、</p>
<p>糖業自金融界發生風潮、昨劃盤交易、愈形淸淡、現貨亦未聞做開、</p>
<p>大連黃荳、來電頻小、本埠各帮進胃均呆、昨三月期貨　開跌錢許、</p>

<p>藝術界</p>
<h3>藝術家與羣衆</h3>
<p>— 包羅多</p>
<p>羣衆裏面每一個人一生所要求於人堆裏面的生活、是甚爲客氣的——只不過是生存下去的權利、如果在生存下去的權利上面、發生了阻礙他們的一切、那末他們就非起來造反一次不可、羣衆起來造反實在是一件很正當的行動、因此在我們歷史上面、從古以來所有一次次的大亂、都應該被祝爲大多數人對於生存下去的權利有所要求了、關於這一層、就是以前士大夫裏面專門在那裏壓制着羣衆運動的聖賢之徒、也看得明明白白、爲冶國平天下起見、於是在中國士大夫之間就自然而然發生了一種以節險爲中心生活的傾向——結果是、排斥了一切富麗堂皇的裝飾、對於以藝術思想爲中心的文化、一槪加以極度的輕視、爲了這一層、每一個藝術家在中國傳統思想之下一向是受着意外的虐待、只要是以節險爲中心生活的人、上自帝皇、（最著名的大約是漢文帝吧）下至小民、無不受到贊揚、就是近來這十幾年裏面、儘管中國以前的任何思想都根本的受着搖動、而以節險爲中心生活的人、還是受到贊揚、以藝術思想爲中心生活的享受、在人堆裏面大家都不敢把它叫喊了出來、因此在我們中國、生活的形式至少有兩種、一種是可以告人的、還有一種是不可以告人的、而且在中國傳統思想之下也是不必的、每一個藝術家的生活當然都與羣衆裏面每一個人的不同、那末每一個藝術家的生活都是不必告人的一種了、至於大多數人所要求着的生活、總是甚爲客氣的——只不過是生存下去的要求、每一様都是可以告人的、在别人聽了之後、也决不會因之而表示着不滿、總而言之、在藝術崇拜之國、人人所樂道的藝術家生活、在我們中國都是屬於不必告人的一種、否則就要受到相當的侮辱、迫得他非自己出來登報否認不可、在這様的傳統思想之下、中國每一個有志於深造的藝術家、還是一個個都被强迫着去接受那以節儉爲中心生活的一切、他們在享受上是刻苦的、在生活上是單調的、最後、他們裏面每一個人都没有那在藝術崇拜之國、人人所樂道的藝術家生活、</p>
<p>每一個藝術家的生活、决不會與羣衆裏面每一個人的生活有所衝突、</p>
<p>大多數人天一亮就起來之後、在動作方面當然有許許多多都是同着别人一致的、不妨舉出幾條最爲動要的寫在下面吧——穿衣·吃飯、是不用去說的了、此外每天一定還有刻板的工作、（當然洗臉之類是並不包括在内的）、這様一天天生活下去、久而久之、每一個人到了將要死去的時候、一定會感覺到人生的太無趣味了、每一個藝術家都應該對於生活的享受加以極度的重視、人生的所以有着趣味、全靠藝術家去把它叫喊了出來、然而每天的穿衣·洗臉·吃飯、以及其他一定的刻板的工作、反而都是可以告人的生活、</p>
<p>說幾句不客氣的話吧、「一個人的浪費或者是一種罪惡、至於一個　　的浪費、就無論如何應該是一種文化的享受了、」</p>
<p>最後我還要說「只要是一個優秀的民族、在生活的享受上面、没有不浪費的、没有不暴殄天物的、不過這一種情形、大約不至於會在中國發生的吧、」</p>
<h3>作家和他的報酬</h3>
<p>— 茉莉</p>
<p>誰都知道現在文稿最貴的、要算美國前總統柯立芝、和總督司密斯了、出版家出了一元一字的報酬、請他們把個人在政治上、和社會上所經騐的種種軼聞趣事、寫出來、於是柯立芝辛苦了六個月的文字生涯、他所得的進欵、竟超過他做總統時的年俸、（英國的報紙是這們說的）</p>
<p>一元一字的稿費、固然是可觀的了、然而不能說是破天荒、在外國、實在還有許多先例、幾年前、美國印第安省的士</p>
<p>人、呌里蓮WhitcombRiley的、寫了一首詩、呌「我的舊情人」、Ａn　old　Sweetheart　ofMine這首詩最初所得到的報酬、是極其菲薄、在他當時的進欵裏面、不過是滄海之一粟、但一年復一年、讀他詩的人、漸漸地增加起來、於是詩裏面所描寫的情景、也倩了極出名的畫家、畫了許多美麗動人的圖畫、這様、他那首我的舊情人、幾乎變成人人必讀的一首詩了、在他没有逝世以前、他從那首詩所得到的報酬、差不多每一個字要達五百元、這是怎様一個驚人的數目呀、</p>
<p>這可以算是文字上最高的報酬了、然而還有許多先例、可以證明詩也可以得到報酬的、阿力山大波蒲Ａlexander　Pope譯荷馬的史詩「伊力埃得」、Ｉliad他得到五萬元、司各脫SirWalterScott在他的小說没有成名以前、他早就以「詩人」在當時的文壇馳騁了、他那首燴炙人口的長詩「湖上夫人」、Ｌady　of　The　Lake所得的報酬、是一萬五千元、又英國出版家司密斯爵士、出了二萬五千元、請但尼孫Ｔennyson寫一首和「國王的牧歌」一様長的詩、但比較起來、米爾敦Ｍilton的「失樂園、」總共祇得到五十元、這個數目可也就相差太遠了、</p>
<p>上面所講的、大多數是作家的幸運、然而在另一方面起來、却也有許多偃蹇的、愛倫坡Ｅdgar　Allan　Poe做了一部短篇小說、得到十大元、也就心滿意足、卡萊爾ThomasCarktke生平最得意那一年、他從文學上所收獲的、還不滿一千元、哈雷登Ｂeatrice　Harraden做了一篇小說「晚上經過的船」、Ｓhips　that　Pssin　the　Night馬上賣了一百元、那曉得出版之後、銷路大暢、平空替書賈造就一個發財的機會、</p>
<p>但是到了現在、這種不公平的待遇、似乎已經取消、我們很高興地知道、做福爾摩斯偵探小說的科南道耳、Ｃonan　Doyle他是怎様的由困苦而豐裕、福爾摩斯最初出現的那一年、也就是科南道耳第一次做偵探小說的那一年、是一八八七年、那本小說呌「紅色的研究」、Ａstudy　in　Scarlet共長二萬五千字、那時候的作者、還是一個和環境奮鬥的醫藥社的練習生、未出版的時候、遇到許多困苦、幾使他把自己的稿子毁去、直等到稿子有人受買了、他才得到一百二十五元的報酬、然而這個數目、比他以前任人家隨意給的已經高得許多了、在他從事筆墨生涯的最初八九年中、常常筆不停揮地、寫到深夜、然而没有一年得到八九百元的、到了現在、情形就和從前不同了、「尼格耳爵士」Ｓir　Nigel的版權、賣到兩萬五千元、以後福爾摩斯的著作、平均總有兩元一個字、二十年前、有人把科南道耳的著作的收入、作了一個統計、總數是四十萬元、</p>
<p>四十年前年輕的吉百林、Ｋipling和年輕的科南道耳也是一様、那時候如果有人肯出一二百元請他們做東西、比接　　　們一二萬元還要高興、而且那時候的一二百元、還可以援助他們少受一些兒物質上的痛苦、當吉百林懷着兩篇得意的稿子、「許多新發明」「我們自己的人」、從倫敦到紐約的時候、他對着出版家說、這裏面有無數印度的故事、無數有趣味的印度故事、他幾乎要和上海的商店一様、掛起一面大减價的旗幟來、說我要大賤賣了、當眞的、那時吉百林眞是急於「出貨」、他那篇祇要求五十元、然而一般出版家都微笑着對他搖頭說、我們對於印度故事、並不發生興趣呀、吉百林是絶望了、但在這絶望之中、又生出一線新希望來、原出有一位編輯、聽見他這種苦苦哀求的聲音、很慷慨地出了五十元、買了他一部、等到拿回來仔細一看、却又後悔起來、「這是什麽東西」、那位編輯一面說、一面把這篇稿子望抽斗裏一塞、從此就把它放壞了、</p>
<p>幾年以後、吉百林的小說「一個不知道那裏來的人」Ａ　Man　trom　Nowhere出世了、那時候正是他聲名洋溢的當兒、銷數眞是一日千里、著作家和編輯正相聚一堂、在那裏互相慶賀、那位編輯先生看見吉百林、忽然想起一樁心事、他道、「這是怎麽一回事呢、哎呀、閣下不就是Ｍr·Kipling嗎、不好了、那篇小說還擱在我的抽斗裏呢」、他說着這話、酒也不喝了、連忙趕到辦公室裏、把吉百林的小說、從許多棄稿堆裏尋出來、馬上催着排字房裏去排印、</p>
<p>話是越說越遠了、幾乎從「著作家和他的報酬」、說到著作家的軼事上去、且讓我再說兩個人、把這篇收束了吧、關於司各脫、上文我已經說過了、現在又還有幾句話、來得補充一下、在他文名正盛的時候、他每一篇小說總要四萬元、但不幸的很、從一八二六到一八二八年、這三年中、司各脫經營出版事業、却大虧其本、這幾年中、他從文稿上所得的報酬、已達二十萬元、而這二十萬元、他差不多全數拿去付還他的債權人、在一八五一年、他死後第十九年、阿台姆勃來克Ａdan　Black出了二萬七千金鎊、買了他許多小說的再版權、再過兩年、羅脫來雞Ｒoutledge又以十萬元把他的大部份小說購來、用很便宜的紙張翻印、以便售價低廉、可以使一般讀者都有能力購買、</p>
<p>愛爾蘭詩人、托麥斯穆耳、ＴhomasMoore欠了一萬五千元的債、正在無力償還的時候、給拜倫知道了、立刻寫了一本小說送給他、這並不是秀才人情紙半張、因爲有那位浪孟先生、Ｍr·Loueman出</p>
<p>了一萬五千元、把版權買去、而且知道穆耳窮苦、另外還送了他八千元、拜倫重俠好義、也就可見一斑了、</p>

<p>婦女生活</p>
<h3>曁大女同學舉行三八婦女節紀念　王瑛</h3>
<p>曁南大學女同學本日舉行三八婦女節紀念大會、邀請名人演講、以誌昨報、茲將該校女同學王瑛、交來「三八節與中國婦女」一文、刊載如下、</p>
<p>三月八日是國際婦妇節紀念日、也便是女界智識分子團結同志、共謀婦女切實解放的好機會、</p>
<p>國際婦女、因爲忍受不住那壓迫的痛苦、纔有一九零九年三月八日、丹麥京城柯伯何更代表大會的産生、結果决定了三月八日這一天爲婦女節、其目的在求麵包與和平、及保護女工、至一九一零年、德奥各國婦女也曾招集了二萬餘婦女、在維也納地方、舉行了一個大規模的示威運動、後來各國響應、每逢「三八」這一天、便由婦女們招集大會、一方面表示紀念、一方面更提出婦女們自身要求的事項、編入口號中、以喚起社會上各界女男的注意、并爲實施解放的方針、</p>
<p>國際婦女所以能有現在的地位、—逃脫壓迫的痛苦、女男經濟地位的平等、女男職業地位的平等、實皆關係於婦女運動的效果、試看我們中國的婦女、現在仍然不能盡脫壓迫的痛苦、女男經濟地位、仍然不能盡達平等、女男職業地位、也還有許多不能平等、近年以來、雖然有少數的幸運兒、得受敎育的機會、但仍有極多數的可憐蟲、在呑聲忍氣中、受社會上重重又重重的壓迫、過渡那非人的生活、而不敢稍加一些兒的爭扎與反抗、好像在那裏靜候着、智識界中的女救星、和覺悟者、爲可憐蟲的她們、設法救出火炕、</p>
<p>中國婦女的痛苦很多、一時不能詳述、更限於篇幅、僅就最痛苦的略述如下、（一）妓女的痛苦、妓女生活最苦、送舊迎新、心不歡必强笑、酒不勝必强飮、身不快必强陪、喉不爽必强歌、遇性情惡劣的客人、稍不合意、便辱駡相加、否則徹夜蹂躏、不堪其擾、唉、她們的生活、實猪犬之不如了、再看上海地方每晚馬路旁拉客的野鷄、其可憐狀實在勝過了乞丐、（二）農工婦女的痛苦、終日工作如牛馬、所得報酬極微細、遇家人性情惡劣的、更打駡相加、予以非人的待遇、（三）舊禮敎家庭中婦女之痛苦、男尊女卑之奴隷生活、婚姻不自主、婦女永無讀書的機會、</p>
<p>總之、中國婦女的痛苦一言難盡、現在的三八節便是我們中國婦女惟一的救命節、所以我們要擴大宣傳、招集各界婦女、並要請各界熱心婦運的男同志、舉行紀念會、并共同討論、婦女切身問題和要求、我們要努力奮鬥着向光明途中進攻、不達目的不止、我們的口號是、一、保護被壓迫而逃婚的婦女、二、速辦農工婦女學校、三、速立兒童寄託所、四、廢除娼妓、五、速辦婦女工藝所以謀經濟獨立、六、根據同工同酬保護母性原則制定婦女勞動法、七、反對童養媳、八、反對蓄婢、九、保護童工、十、打破奴隷婦女性的禮敎、</p>
<h3>馬來的舞女　時鐸</h3>
<p>在馬來民間裏、我們雖然不能看見那寛敞華麗的跳舞塲、但我們却能從綠蔭深處聽到嬌嫩酣膩的歌聲、這個歌聲、便是從馬來舞女的口腔裏發出來的心曲、她們有的以跳舞賣唱爲生涯、有的却當作一部分的職業、要在農作舒閒時纔出來的、這一輩舞女、有的是中年婦女、有的是年華二八的少女、除了少數的少女外、她們多是有夫之婦的、大槪在一帮舞班中、除了一兩個舞女外、還有幾個鼓手、一兩個丑脚、一行七八人、隨處歌唱、大槪此埠唱得生意冷淡了、便轉到他埠去、她們的行踪是飄忽不定的、</p>
<p>傍晚的時分、她們便盛裝出來開始舞唱了、在綠蔭樹下、用四枝木頭架起一個草棚、地上舖着草蓆、她們就在草蓆上面跳起舞來、一邊跳、一邊唱、中間還雜着丑脚的怪聲、一悠一剛、聽了眞要敎人捧腹、待顧客若要光顧時、便用手巾或其他輕便的東西向場中投去、不一會、丑脚便領了舞女走向顧主來、舞女的脚跟上原聲有銅鈴、此時走起路來、便「錚炸錚炸」的響着、追着這音響的、自然是一羣大大小小的觀衆了、</p>
<p>舞女走到顧客的跟前、自得有一番交際的手續、接着纔潤起她們的喉嚨、唱一曲令人沉醉的淸歌、唱畢、顧客便給予代價、在滿面笑容中、仍舊走回塲裏來、再等着第二個顧客的光臨、如是往返、到午夜時分、她們纔收場返家休息、再準備着第二天的工作、如是的生活、是多麽舒閑恬靜的啊、</p>
<h3>她的禁烟令　珂</h3>
<p>風和日暖、大地上底一切一切、都佈滿了春意、校園裏枯楊衰草、也在發芽抽條、飽含着欣欣向榮的姿態、校門口更是熱閙得有趣、黃包車拉、馬車拉、汽車拉、一輛一輛不斷的往來着、眞所謂車水馬龍、煞是好看、她或他、身邊都帶了箱子·舖蓋·網籃·手提篋、臉上一個個堆滿了笑容、問訊拉、握手拉、在在表示出他們小别重聚、一種熱烈的快樂、寒假不曾歸去、久處寂寞的她、好容易巴得要開課了、看了這一番熱閙的景象、忍不住東跑跑、西逛逛、祇見敎室裏、走廊上、或是一間不大注意、和不常到的房子裏、都可以看得他見和她、一對對底喁喁情話、比平時更有一種形容不出的親熱、她抱着冷肅</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>的　　的態度、價多的　去、</p>
<p>「莫、你一個人去那里、我們的好友密司周密司易都來了、我和你看她們去」茜說着挽了她的手走、轉過一道走廊、就聽見密司周密司易和幾個同學的談笑聲、由一間休息室裏傳出來、她和茜走了進去、大家都含笑的招呼、室裏共坐了五個人、周和易外、一個是周的戀人程君、一個是易的戀人王君、還有一個姓陳的男同學、</p>
<p>「茜、你有紙烟嗎、王竉得很厲害、你做做好事、給他一根吸吧、」程一邊說、一邊向着易笑、</p>
<p>「我是不吸烟的、你轉和别人討吧、」茜話未說究、陳搶着說、我有我有、還在衣袋裏掏出一個烟匣子、遞給王、接了抽出一根來、自己却不吸、轉送與程說、「我曉得你、今天早上偷偷地吸了烟　現在癮又發了、不敢說、却來借着我發揮、我是聞着烟味都有點頭晕了」、程把他的烟接過來、往地下一丢、拿脚亂踏、笑着說、　　「你這小鬼頭、眞會說　、等我來收拾你、」跑過來把王的頭按得差不多要和他接吻、王笑得喘不過氣來、斷續地嚷着　　「你饒了我吧、密司易講個情呀、」她</p>
<p>見他們一根紙烟閙得恁地起勁、忍不住</p>
<p>詫異問茜說、</p>
<p>「程和王平常都很愛吸烟的、爲什麽現在見了烟、却像仇　一般、」</p>
<p>「咦、你還不知過嗎、因爲易和周不喜歡吸紙烟、就下了一個戒烟令、所以他兩人、現在都不吸了、但是各個自己又不好表白、祗得一打一挑的來向她倆請焋」</p>
<p>「啊、照茜這様說、什麽政府的禁烟令、團體的戒烟運動、都比不上這様的奉命維護、收效迅速啊、若還我們全中國底他的她、都和易同周一様、對她的　下個禁烟令、那倒中國戒烟前途、很可以樂觀、更不勞那此官様文章了、」陳笑着說、王和程被他們說破了、倒覺得有點難爲情、周和易却媽然的微笑、表示出伊心裏無限底愉快、</p>

<h3>Yan and Feng Decide to Go Abroad</h3>
<p>Feng Orders Jian Youwen to Purchase Ship Tickets</p>
<p>Representatives from All Sides Continuously Leave Bing</p>
<p>(Beijing) Yan telegraphed Lu Zhonglin, Han Fuju, and Shi Yousan, and showed Fang Hanzhang the telegram. He advocated for peace, stating that it could not only repay the present world but also influence the future. He expressed his utmost admiration. He stated that his weak and ill body had already decided to step down and go abroad to rest. Xishan supports this. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng told the Guangxi representatives that his decision to go abroad was final. He had already summoned Jian Youwen to Bing to prepare to purchase ship tickets. If Yan attempted to persuade him to stay, he planned to leave first. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Daiwen has returned to Bing and is optimistic about the current situation, saying that the Third Group Reorganization and Disbandment will continue to be handled. Representatives met with Zhao, but Zhao did not speak about the current situation. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Pinghan Railway Bureau received a telegram from Zhengzhou stating that the slogans here have been changed to "Support the Central Government, Down with Speculative Political Parties," posted by Shi Yousan's troops. It is rumored here that the Central Government has sent Zhang, followed by Li Shizeng and Wu Zhihui, to Bing to discuss post-departure arrangements with Yan. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jian Youwen, the former Director of the Diplomatic Department of the Second Group, went to Bing yesterday to welcome Feng's departure abroad. Jian said before leaving that Yan arrived at Jian'an Village, Wutai on the 25th to meet with Feng and invited Feng to Bing. Feng immediately said that he did not want to participate in the affairs of the old Northwest troops and would let them decide their own fate. He was determined to go abroad, saying that the future is long and there will be time to serve the country. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Starting yesterday, slogans everywhere have been painted over. The Provincial Party Headquarters has removed the slogans "Down with Provocative Politicians and Frustrated Military Men" and put up new ones. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The envoy has proven that Han and Shi support the Central Government, saying that the military crisis has passed. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Taiyuan states that representatives from all sides have been successively raising funds to leave Bing. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a certain important person, Yan Xishan's resignation and departure abroad with Feng Yuxiang was motivated six months ago. Now that the overall situation is like this, in order to implement peaceful unification, his departure abroad with Feng can likely become a reality. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The municipal government received a telegram from Yang Zhaotai on the 7th stating that his illness has gradually healed and he is currently resting quietly in a mental hospital in Bing. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Garrison Headquarters announced a telegram from Beiping regarding Yan: (1) According to news from Bingyuan, after Yan's Yangdian declaration, a total of seven divisions and eight brigades under his command were mobilized to move south, distributing a large amount of military pay and weapons to the troops in Shaanxi and Henan, using them as a vanguard, spending no less than ten million in military expenses. All the generals were worried about dealing with him and immediately divided after receiving their pay and weapons. Yan was therefore extremely panicked and ordered all parts of the Jin army to withdraw to Hebei on the 5th. (2) Zou Lu, a representative of the Xishan faction, was refused a meeting with Yan at noon on the 5th. Yan told people that he had governed Jin for many years and had never been deceived. Since the founding of the Republic, he had handled the situation quite successfully. This time, he was fooled by politicians, which was not worth it. His previous declaration of stepping down will be put into practice. (3) Yan heard that various parties were preparing to attack and that the Northwest Army also intended to invade Jin. Secret meetings were held in Bing for several days. It is rumored in Beiping that this is unlikely to happen. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Cao and Zheng's Jin Army Completely Withdraws</h3>
<p>Sun Chu's Army Will Be Transferred to Daming</p>
<p>Han and Shi's Troops Advance Towards Hebei</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Military News: After Yan telegraphed his resignation, the Jin armies in Caozhou and Zhengzhou simultaneously withdrew. Han and Shi's troops are advancing from Henan to Hebei. The Jin army troops on the Jinpu Railway are currently gathered in the northern section awaiting orders, but there are also signs of withdrawal. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Railway News: Sun Chu's Jin army stationed in Zhengzhou has withdrawn completely to Hebei. Han Fuju has ordered Shi Yousan's troops to start filling the defense from Guide to Zhengzhou starting on the 6th. The Longhai Railway will resume traffic between Xuzhou and Zhengzhou on the 8th. Qian Zongze returned to Xuzhou from Nanjing on the evening of the 6th and will go to Zhengzhou to take over the Longhai Railway Bureau after the Xuzhou-Zhengzhou line is open. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Jin Yuan Zhaochang returned to Jinan from Yanzhou with a company of artillery. According to reports, the Jin army in Heze and Dingtao retreated on the 4th, and there are currently no Jin troops in the entire territory of Caozhou. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) It is reported that Zuo Yiyi telegraphed Chen Tiaoyuan, requesting him to quickly order the Jinpu Railway to repair the Yellow River Ya Railway Bridge to restore north-south traffic. Two steel beams of the bridge were destroyed and must be purchased from Germany. Traffic can only be temporarily restored by jacking up the bridge with sleepers. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pinghan News: Shi Yousan moved his defense to Zhengzhou under Chiang's order. Sun Chu's troops began to withdraw north of the Yellow River within days. Cao Fulin's and Liu Chunrong's troops will move south under the Central Government's order. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shi Yousan's troops have arrived in Zhengzhou. Wan Xuancai declared that his troops have always obeyed the Central Government and were not listed in the public telegram. After Sun Chu's troops withdraw to Shunde, they plan to move to Daming. (7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from the Jin side, Sun Chu's 33rd Division has moved from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang Zhangde and will be transferred to the Daming area to strengthen the military strength against western Shandong. (7th Electric News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The General Headquarters reported on the 7th that Shangguan Yunxiang, the commander of the 47th Division, stated: 1. The Northwest Army has changed its army to divisions due to battle losses. 2. The Jin army has built fortifications south of Zhengzhou. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Telegrams Between Ma and Zhao</h3>
<p>Ma Asks Zhao to Mediate for Peace</p>
<p>Zhao Says Yan Has Decided to Go Abroad</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Fuxiang sent a telegram to Zhao Daiwen saying that since Yan Gong's Yangdian declaration, all the other generals except those from the Northwest and Guangxi have been sending telegrams for days, denying and even slandering it, to an extent beyond description. Since Han and Shi telegraphed their advocacy for peace, the situation has changed again. People's hearts are different, each as their own face. The situation has reached a critical point. Chiang has no prejudice against Yan, and even in the telegrams between the two, there are still lingering intentions and have not reached a complete break. It is a pity that Xiang and Jie, the three brothers, are plagued by illness and cannot run around, and you, sir, have not been able to come south, so that the feelings between the two sides have been instigated and alienated, and are about to move from estrangement to misunderstanding. Every time I think about the humble advice I have given to you and Yan Gong in the past, I am deeply ashamed that my unfortunate predictions have come true. If Yan Gong does not seize this opportunity to change course, then the history of the revolution will be at risk of falling into the hands of reactionaries. Xiang, for the sake of the country and his friends, cannot remain silent and, at a time when there are no tears to shed, offers another foolish suggestion that is worth considering. Please, sir, earnestly persuade Yan Gong to end with justice and peace, then he will understand the divine opportunity and there is no other way to remedy the situation. With sincere words, I still rely on your miraculous use to achieve the goal of peace. I eagerly await and pray. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on the World Unemployment Problem</h3>
<p>The more developed a country's industry, the more important the unemployment problem becomes once the industry declines. For example, the recent unemployment demonstrations are particularly severe in the United States, Britain, and Germany compared to other countries, which is the reason. Countries with developed industries, in addition to their domestic needs, seek overseas markets. Overseas markets are limited, but industrial progress is infinite. The result will inevitably lead to excessive goods. Excessive goods lead to low prices. Low prices inevitably lead to factory failures and closures, or contraction and reduced work. Thus, unemployment must increase as a result. This is the inevitable trend of industrial development and is unavoidable. The necessary needs of mankind are only a few items. The rest are mostly luxury and pleasure items, which can all be saved. Among these essential needs, food and housing are the most important. Food is produced from the land, requiring very little industry. Housing cannot be moved to other countries as goods. Therefore, the only commodities that everyone needs and become markets are clothing. However, if people have no money, they can temporarily keep their old clothes. Therefore, in the simplest terms of human needs, although it cannot be said that all the world's goods are useless, most are not essential for everyone. Therefore, in today's situation where industrial development is excessive and has entered a path of decline, it is impossible to return to the previous prosperity. Therefore, if one wants to solve the world unemployment problem without seeking other paths, and still wants to use the previous industrial competition method to try to survive, it will definitely not be effective. When things reach an extreme, they must reverse. Is this fate? Important Domestic Telegrams Two</p>

<h3>International Unemployment Day Labor Demonstrations</h3>
<p>Twenty Thousand Unemployed Gather and March in New York</p>
<p>Unemployed Workers Clash with Police in Various Places</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 6th – According to this morning's investigation, regarding the unemployment demonstration situation in major American cities and towns, unemployed workers gathered all night to commemorate International Unemployment Day. However, local municipal authorities decided not to use oppressive measures for the time being to observe the situation. Therefore, the fear of violent clashes has almost subsided. The ill feelings between the authorities and workers in New York and Chicago are deep, which is concerning. It is said that most of the organizers of the commemorative activities are Communist Party members. Over a thousand unemployed workers in New York gathered in Union Square this morning at sunrise, but there were no riots by noon. Similar gatherings were reported in other cities and towns. San Francisco authorities decided to dispatch police officers to accompany and protect the workers' march, and the mayor greeted unemployed workers at City Hall. Other places generally adopted an armed neutrality, neither enforcing nor expressing sympathy.</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 6th – Today, 20,000 unemployed people, under the guidance of former Communist presidential candidate Foster, gathered in Union Square. After the meeting, they intended to march in formation. When the police's attempts to dissuade them failed, detectives brandished nightsticks, and police cars rushed back and forth through the crowd of workers, arresting several leaders. The crowd then quietly dispersed.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Detroit, 6th – Today, unemployed workers attempted to form a marching line here but were dispersed by the police, and several people were detained.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 6th – The result of the unemployment march in Washington, D.C., was a chaotic fight. Onlookers dragged speakers off the podium, and many people carrying American flags attempted to rush into City Hall but were stopped by the police, who arrested four people.</p>
<p>(National News Agency, New York, 6th – According to news from European capitals, there were several clashes today for International Unemployment Day. There were marches in Paris and Berlin. As a result, unemployed people in Berlin clashed with the police, and one person died.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 6th – Today, unemployed workers demonstrated in front of the White House. Police were forced to use tear gas, injuring several Communists and arresting 20 people. In New York's Union Square, 75,000 people participated in the demonstration. After the police prevented the crowd from marching to City Hall, conflicts arose, injuring several police officers and Communists. The leaders were all arrested. In Detroit, 100,000 demonstrators were dispersed by the police, with 12 injured and 17 arrested. Dozens were arrested in Quinterberg for demonstrating. Chicago police authorities did not allow unemployed workers to demonstrate but allowed their leaders to meet with the mayor to express their grievances.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th – Communists wanted to incite demonstrations around the world today, the so-called International Unemployment Demonstration Day, but their plan has completely failed. There were minor conflicts between demonstrators and police in London's East End, Shoreditch, Manchester, Glasgow, and other places, and several people were arrested. According to news from continental Europe, the police were heavily guarded. Although many people were arrested, there were few major disturbances. However, in Berlin in the evening, the police were forced to use batons and pistols to resist the Communist demonstrators. It is reported that 73 people were arrested, and one demonstrator shot himself to death. Eleven civilians and five police officers were injured.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 6th – Paris Communists celebrated International Labor Day today, causing disturbances, resulting in the arrest of 52 people, including six foreigners, who will be deported.</p>
<h3>Gandhi to Begin Non-Violent Resistance</h3>
<p>Scheduled for March 12th</p>
<p>The Viceroy Has Been Notified by Letter</p>
<p>Shan Ke Ali Opposes This Move</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 7th – Gandhi sent a letter to the Viceroy, announcing his intention to begin non-violent resistance on March 12th. The Viceroy replied through his secretary, stating that he had received the letter and expressing regret regarding Gandhi's proposed actions, as this move would inevitably involve violating the law and disturbing public order.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ahmedabad, 6th – Nationalist leader Gandhi has decided to start a movement of non-violent resistance from March 12th. The location for starting the movement has been selected as Jalalpur in the Surat district. At that time, the first batch of volunteers under Gandhi's command will start activities. It is said that they plan to walk 10 miles each day. Gandhi received a telegram today from the Bombay Province Nationalist Congress Committee, requesting the dispatch of Bajpai to Bombay to prepare for the start of the non-violent resistance movement. Bajpai is one of Gandhi's assistants.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 6th – Shan Ke Ali, one of the prominent figures in Bombay's Ali brothers, who previously supported Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, disagreed with the non-violent resistance movement at a Muslim gathering today, saying that he expected this move would lead to bloodshed. He hoped that Indians with love and common sense would unite to find a way to prevent the immediate danger.</p>
<h3>Expert Committee Continues Discussion on Submarine Issues</h3>
<p>The First Committee is Postponed</p>
<p>The French Delegation Arrives in London</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th – The naval expert committee continued its discussion on submarine issues today. Britain, the United States, and Italy are all prepared to accept a maximum displacement of 1,800 tons as the basis for discussion. Japan wants to set the maximum at 2,000 tons. France is prepared to recognize a maximum of 2,000 tons, but requires permission for France to build several submarines not exceeding 3,000 tons. Although Britain and the United States would prefer to set the maximum at 1,800 tons, they may also recognize 2,000 tons as a concession, but it must be stipulated that there is only one type of submarine below 2,000 tons. Italy is eager to have only one type of submarine and is willing to support a tonnage that everyone can use.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th – The French delegation to the Five-Power Naval Conference, except for Premier and Representative Tardieu, arrived in London tonight.</p>
<p>Trans-Ocean News Service, London, 6th – On the afternoon of the 6th, the expert committee began to examine the issue of limiting submarine types. Japan insisted on its previous proposal of 2,000 tons to counter the British and American proposal of 1,700 tons. France generally supported Japan's proposal. The existing and under construction large submarines over 2,000 tons for each country were: six for Britain and the United States, four for Japan, three for Italy, and two for France. Japan intends to recognize its holdings, citing the precedent of acknowledging the construction of the auxiliary cruiser Akashi-class. After discussion, the British and American proposal of a single 1,800-ton submarine failed. All countries agreed to Japan's proposed alternative of 2,000 tons.</p>
<p>Trans-Ocean News Service, London, 6th – The first committee, which was scheduled to meet at 10:00 AM on the 6th to review important proposals such as the type of ships and warships decided by the expert committee, was postponed to 2:00 PM on the 7th because the printed materials on special warships were not yet ready.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 6th – Acting Secretary of State Cotton explained today the preliminary conditions agreed upon by Stimson and the British side, saying that the 200,000-ton reduction in tonnage seemingly included battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. However, the tonnage of cruisers would remain the same, and even a separate method could be devised to increase the tonnage of cruisers. Cotton was also optimistic about the reduction methods for other types of ships.</p>
<h3>The Floodwaters in France Are Gradually Receding</h3>
<p>The President Will Personally Go to the Disaster Area to Investigate</p>
<p>Another 100 Million Francs Allocated for Relief Funds</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 6th – The death toll from the floods in southern France has now reached 400 and is gradually increasing. The floodwaters are gradually receding, and destroyed houses are being inspected. There are 10,000 homeless people. The main road from Bordeaux to Sète will take two months to repair, while the reconstruction of towns will take several years. The British King and the British government have sent telegrams of condolence. French Premier Tardieu has postponed his trip to London because President Doumergue has decided to personally go to the disaster area to investigate, and Tardieu will accompany him. Reuters, Paris, 7th – The Chamber of Deputies today resolved to allocate 100 million francs for disaster relief. The first batch of 30 million francs allocated by the government was like a drop in the bucket. The current allocation is still insufficient in light of the disaster situation. Therefore, a private fundraising campaign has been launched.</p>
<h3>Two Prominent Americans Oppose Shipping Grain to China</h3>
<p>Believing it Cannot Be Implemented</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 6th – Senator McMaster proposed that the Federal Agricultural Bureau allocate 25 million yuan to purchase grain to be shipped to China for disaster relief and requested that the Chinese government guarantee repayment within ten years. Today, two important figures presented opposing views to the Senate Agriculture Committee. One was former Minister to China, Rockhill, who viewed this plan as impossible to implement. The other was the president of the American Red Cross, Payne, who said that China already has several thousand shi of grain for relief, but it cannot be transported to the disaster areas due to a lack of trains, causing it to rot on the way. According to Mr. Payne, this statement is based on recent news from Beijing, which reports that a large amount of relief grain is piled up near Beijing, but military personnel are commandeering the trains, making it impossible to transport it, resulting in the spoilage of the grain while millions of disaster victims starve to death in the ditches.</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Health Committee Studies Chinese Proposals</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 6th – The League of Nations Health Committee continues to study the proposals from the Chinese government. The Chinese government has requested the League to provide assistance in the form of practical advice for certain health undertakings in China's construction plan, especially for the Ministry of Health's reorganization of ship quarantine matters. The plan proposed by China includes the immediate establishment of a national hospital in Zhejiang Province as a model for other provinces and the reform of medical training. The Chinese government also proposes that the Singapore Infectious Disease Bureau work with the Chinese Ministry of Health to eradicate smallpox and cholera. It is estimated that the implementation of China's proposals will require 1 million Chinese currency. China has assumed an obligation of 200,000 yuan. At today's meeting, Dr. Miyajima of Japan spoke of Japan's great attention to the Health Committee's work in the Far East and opened up on the importance of China's proposals. He believed that from an international perspective, the most important issue was the reorganization of China's ship quarantine. He also said that the Japanese medical community was willing to work with the Chinese authorities under the introduction of the League of Nations. Dr. Yan, Director of the Medical Administration Department of the Chinese Ministry of Health, spoke to thank Dr. Miyajima and said that the Chinese health authorities were willing to cooperate with Japanese and other nationals in the proposed plan. Participants in the discussion included Sir Buchanan, the representative of the British government, and others.</p>
<h3>The King of Spain is Unwilling to Abdicate</h3>
<p>Both Republican and Royalist Parties Strive to the Utmost</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 7th – The Republican and Royalist parties are now actively campaigning, one to overthrow the monarchy and implement a republic, and the other to do its utmost to preserve the throne.

<h3>The Pope Provokes the Italian Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Denounces Fascists</p>
<p>Reuters, Vatican City, 7th – The Pope today provoked Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, denouncing the Italian Fascists. He also attacked the sale of books unsuitable for children in bookstores in front of the Vatican clergy and said that the Fascists' attitude towards the church and education was disappointing.</p>
<h3>English Churches Will Pray for the Russians</h3>
<p>Government Instructs Not to Allow Soldiers to Participate</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th – The British government has instructed the army, navy, and air force not to force soldiers to line up to participate in church gatherings on March 16th to pray for the Russians. A Labour MP also raised questions in the House of Commons today, and a factual statement was made in the House of Lords. Air Minister Thomson said in the House of Lords that no matter how euphemistically this prayer meeting is explained, it is ultimately no different from rebuking the Russian government. Since Britain has restored diplomatic relations with Russia, it is inappropriate to allow soldiers to formally participate, as the Russian government would say that the British government is using religion to incite the military's hatred of Russia. The Archbishop of Canterbury took the stage to read the original draft of the prayer, saying that there was no political meaning in it.</p>

<h3>Student Strike Wave in the Philippines</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Manila, 7th – Although the students on strike here have been earnestly advised by Quezon, the President of the Philippine Senate, to return to class and to discuss their grievances through responsible personnel, the students are still refusing to resume classes. It is said that the students will soon elect a committee from among the parents of the students and student organizations to negotiate with the authorities. The students' actions are generally within bounds, with only occasional passionate speeches. There is definitely no truth to the so-called incitement by the Communist Party. The education authorities all want to protect their reputation, which is why this matter is difficult to resolve immediately.</p>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 6th – Students ignored the advice of Governor Davis and Senate President Quezon and continued to strike, and students from two more schools have joined in. Today, a girl was waiting for her parents to escort her home and was humiliated by the crowd in the plaza of a certain high school, and her clothes were almost torn off. Fortunately, she was rescued by the police. Today, the police did not arrest anyone, nor were there any injuries.</p>
<h3>Heoka Kazubumi's Home Searched</h3>
<p>Trans-Ocean News Service, Tokyo, 7th – The home of Heoka Kazubumi, the head of the Social Cooperative Party and former Diet member, who lives in Kameido outside Tokyo, was suddenly searched yesterday. Numerous documents exchanged between Heoka and certain Soviet Russian quarters were seized. At the time of the general election, Heoka ran in the sixth district of Tokyo and was said to have received 200,000 yuan in Chinese paper money to use as election campaign funds. The party's secretary-general, election campaigner, and anarchist, Hirose Kurō, was also suspected of vote-buying and was investigated after the general election, revealing that Heoka had received large sums of money from the Soviet Russian side. That is why his home was searched. Heoka's behavior has been ambiguous since he attended the International Parliamentary Conference last July and has been noted by the authorities. Later, he went to China with Tokonami and also had contact with certain Chinese quarters.</p>

<h3>Northeast Prepares to Commemorate the Martyrs</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: In the recent Sino-Russian war, our side suffered a great number of casualties. In order to commemorate the loyal and righteous and to comfort the heroic souls, the provincial and municipal legal entities are preparing a large-scale memorial service. A preparatory meeting was held at the General Chamber of Commerce at 6:00 PM on the 25th. Representatives from the General Chamber of Commerce, the Foreign Affairs Association, the Youth Association, the Education Association, the Agricultural Association, the National Common Sense Promotion Association, the Lawyers Association, the Morality Association, and various schools and newspapers, totaling over 40 people, attended. Jin Zhezhen, the president of the General Chamber of Commerce, reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that this memorial service was to commemorate the soldiers who died in the defense against Russia. The Sino-Russian war was an international war, and the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country were of great value and unprecedented in the past 30 years. The fallen leaders included Brigade Commander Han Guangdi, Deputy Brigade Commander Wei of Liang Zhongjia's brigade, and the two regimental commanders, Lin and Zhang. There were also thousands of lower-ranking officers and soldiers. The association began organizing in December of the 18th year. When the Northeastern authorities held a military conference earlier, this matter was discussed. Chairman Wan of Heilongjiang Province scheduled a memorial service for April 5th at the Martyrs' Shrine in Longsha Park, Jiang Province, and has telegraphed the entire country to solicit eulogies and has established a preparatory committee, appointing Du Hongnian, the counselor of the National Defense Preparatory Office, as the director of the preparatory office, Section Chief Li of the Staff Office as the accountant, Section Chief E of the National Defense Office as the person in charge of soliciting contributions, and Section Chief Zhang of the Adjutant Office as the person in charge of general affairs. The duties of literary style are jointly undertaken by Secretary He and Section Chief Meng of the National Defense Office. In addition, there are several adjutants and staff members assisting in the handling. The province is now also planning to hold the memorial service simultaneously on April 5th. When Superintendent Mo Liuzhen went south recently, he mentioned this matter to various dignitaries of the National Government. The National Government then realized the truth and planned to honor the fallen Brigade Commander Han and cast a bronze statue of Han in the Central Park in Nanjing. Commander Zhang has now collected Han's articles and works and sent them to the Northeast University Factory to print 10,000 copies to be distributed to various legal entities and organizations as a permanent commemoration. The address of the memorial service is planned to be held at Xiaoheyan. After the establishment of this preparatory committee, it will telegraph the National Government and the party headquarters of various provinces and cities to solicit elegiac couplets. The content of the preparatory committee has been decided by public discussion to be divided into eight departments: publicity, general affairs, lectures, discipline, investigation, supervision, reception, and ceremonies. Nineteen committee members were elected: Jin Zhezhen, Lu Naigeng, Yan Yuheng, Bian Zongmeng, Wang Jingxuan, Guo Daofu, Zhang Youqi, Wang Zhuchen, Yu Zhishu, Guan Sijiu, Li Hanwu, Mei Foguang, Song Xugang, Wang Zihua, Li Mengxing, Wang Xiushan, Chen Xianyi, Yan Weitang, and Ji Jinsheng. After the election, it was decided that the entire city would lower flags to half-mast on the day of the memorial service, observe five minutes of silence, and cease all work activities, and send letters to various counties to hold the memorial service simultaneously.

<h3>Continued Exchange Measures for Shanxi Currency Not Announced</h3>
<p>Those Exchanging Cash Are Still Very Crowded</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since the Shanxi currency was suspended again, the exchange rate has continued to rise, increasing from 8 yuan to 22 yuan in just a few days. If it continues to rise, it will return to the original state of 26 yuan last year. As for soaring prices, one can imagine. The people have been in a state of panic in recent days, and public discussions have regarded the exchange as a major social issue. The authorities have held many meetings recently and had previously planned to allow arbitrary exchange for those under 50 yuan and to require a 40% deduction for financial bonds for those over 50 yuan. This plan is still under review and has not been announced to the public. Yesterday, Meng Yuanwen of the Financial Public Bond Committee, under the order of the Provincial Government, convened Qiu Yangjun, the Director of Civil Affairs, Li Shangren, the Director of Industry and Commerce, Yuan Hongji, the Director of Public Security, Wang Zhaotai, the President of the General Chamber of Commerce, and others to hold a meeting to discuss and decide on eight measures to crack down on unscrupulous merchants who undermine the exchange of provincial currency, which are recorded as follows: (1) The number of banknotes issued by the Provincial Bank must be accurately determined and the issuance of additional banknotes shall be temporarily suspended thereafter; (2) The banknotes exchanged shall be reported to the Provincial Government on a daily basis and temporarily sealed by the Provincial Bank; (3) A separate address shall be found for the exchange and registration shall be made one day in advance, and the exchange shall be carried out in order the following day; (4) The daily exchange shall be limited to 400 numbers; (5) Each number shall not exchange more than 200 yuan; (6) Exchange shall be carried out by matching the issuance of financial public bonds; (7) Discounting of banknotes is prohibited; (8) Raising the exchange rate is strictly prohibited. It is also reported that the authorities have stated that during the previous period of exchange of provincial currency, it was crowded every day, and the staff of the Provincial Bank were unable to handle it. Moreover, those holding currency for exchange have inevitably been turned away in recent days, and these people holding currency for exchange are not only merchants and residents of the provincial capital, but also a majority of those coming to the province from various counties holding currency. In order to unify the measures, once all the procedures for the continued exchange of this provincial currency are in place, it is planned to order the branches and outposts of the Provincial Bank in the outer counties to handle it in the same way as in the province. This is currently being planned. (February 28th)</p>
<h3>Provisional Measures for Anhui Northern Militia</h3>

<h3>The Process of Monitoring Lu Dangping</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Lu Dangping, member of the Tianjin Municipal Party Reorganization Committee and concurrently Minister of Propaganda, has been working diligently since taking office. He has issued various slogans with sharp language. Lu is also dissatisfied with the actions of the Shanxi faction and often expresses his views. On February 24, the military and political authorities suddenly received a telegram from Yan Xishan, instructing them to pay attention to the Party headquarters' activities. On the afternoon of February 26, at 6 p.m., Lu was suddenly placed under surveillance by armed police from the Second Special District. At the time, it was only said that there were rumors of actions detrimental to Lu, so police were dispatched for protection. Lu's freedom of movement was restricted, and he could not meet with guests. Other members of the Reorganization Committee, Liu Butong and Chen Shiquan, were shocked upon hearing the news and immediately fled to the French Concession that night. After Lu was placed under surveillance, he immediately sent a letter to Mayor Cui Tingxian requesting assistance. Cui replied the next morning, saying that Commander Fu had always treated people with sincerity and kindness, and that he was compelled to act by orders and asked Lu to relax and assured him that there was no danger. After receiving the letter, Lu sent another letter to Cui asking him to find a way to restore his freedom and await a thorough investigation. That afternoon, he was able to meet with guests. Since then, the staff of the Municipal Party Headquarters have fled, leaving only one or two irresponsible employees in the Propaganda Department, Organization Department, Training Department, Civil Training Committee, and Secretariat to guard the documents. Public Security Bureau Chief Zeng Yanxi went to the Municipal Party Headquarters at 4 p.m. to talk to the staff who remained, saying that the detention of Minister Lu was a personal matter, not a Party matter, nor a Social Affairs Bureau matter. He asked everyone to work with peace of mind and continue to be responsible. Although someone has come to negotiate the takeover of the Municipal Party Headquarters, it cannot be handed over without a solid basis or an order from Commander-in-Chief Yan. He ordered the five districts and three precincts to tighten the restrictions on the Municipal Party Headquarters, forbidding all guests from entering. Even internal personnel were required to have badges to enter and exit. In the evening, the Eighth District Party Headquarters distributed leaflets criticizing Chen Shiquan, Minister of Organization, for manipulating the election. At the time, rumors circulated that Chen had been arrested at the station, but investigations later proved this to be false.</p>
<p>Mayor Cui Tingxian issued a handwritten order on the evening of the 27th, appointing Feng Sizhi, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, as acting Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and promoted Liu Jinxuan, a technician, to Assistant in the Secretariat. Feng went to the Social Affairs Bureau on the afternoon of the 28th to assume his duties and summoned the staff of each section to give a speech, saying that he was acting in this position and hoped that everyone would continue to serve with peace of mind.</p>
<p>After Lu Dangping was placed under surveillance, the Garrison Command, in order to dispel external misunderstandings, released the telegram from Taiyuan regarding the handling of Lu's case at midnight. It is recorded as follows: "To Commander Fu of Tianjin, Highly Confidential: We have intercepted a telegram from Lu Dangping of Tianjin to Chen Lifu in Nanjing, stating, 'Please present to the Chairman for his consideration, today Shi secretly copied the full text of the telegram from Li, Huang, Zhang, and Bai to Yan, telegram to Commander-in-Chief Yan Xishan of Taiyuan for his consideration, having read the telegram urging Chiang to step down to apologize to the people of the country, I am pleased to share the same sentiments, I am deeply grateful, but Chiang is selfish and self-serving, and obstinately refuses to repent, I hope to use force to pursue his withdrawal, the initial intention of peace can be ensured, the Southern Righteous Army should follow in your footsteps, I dare to declare my innermost feelings, I cannot express my remote aspirations, Li Zongren, Huang Shaoxiong, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Fakui, etc. kowtow to request deletion.' After investigating, Yan is insidious and has repeatedly caused chaos, all with their background, if it is not clearly ordered to be denounced, the disaster is endless, if the Central Government transports troops by sea and blocks Tianjin and Tanggu, then they have no way, speed is of the essence, delay will be difficult to plan, also, Pingdeng's work, I feel very difficult in the environment, the staff of the telegraph bureau have secretly subsidized 100 yuan, Shi is the one who investigates the other party's news, monthly salary of 80 yuan, the party's activity funds are too small, can the Chair send a certain amount of temporary fees to facilitate inquiring about all the news, in case of emergency, prepare to move to the concession to work, and please the Central Government to send people to install a radio station in Tianjin to avoid the telegram being seized, etc. Especially reach, hope to investigate for important matters, Yan Xing reply."</p>
<h3>Liu Lianyi, Member of the Shandong Provincial Reorganization Committee, Assassinated</h3>
<p>At 5:00 p.m. on the 4th, Liu Lianyi, a member of the Shandong Provincial Reorganization Committee and concurrently Minister of Organization, was assassinated inside the Preparatory Office of the National Qingdao University in Baotu Spring. The Shandong Provincial Reorganization Committee had summoned personnel from Party headquarters in various counties to the province for training, totaling more than 100 people, who were working at the Preparatory Office of Qingdao University. On that day, Liu was working in the class and left work at 5:00 p.m. As soon as he exited the small door in the southeast corner of the training class classroom, he saw students playing ball in the courtyard outside the door. Unexpectedly, there were two people outside the door, one acting as a lookout, and the other immediately shot Liu twice, hitting him in the waist. He immediately fell to the ground. At that time, the students in the courtyard shouted in panic, and the assassin calmly escaped. Liu's entourage immediately called various places to report. Min, the director of the public security sub-bureau in charge of the outer city district, was the first to arrive, and important figures from the Provincial Government, the Provincial Reorganization Committee, and the Municipal Party Headquarters all went to visit. On one hand, they ordered the Public Security Bureau and the Garrison Command to quickly arrest the assassin, and on the other hand, they sent Liu to the Jinan Hospital for treatment by car. At 7:00, Zhai Yuqing, a student from the training class, was arrested, and a pistol was found in his possession, making him a prime suspect. He was sent to the General Headquarters for strict interrogation. Zhai is from Yanggu County. After Liu arrived at Jinan Hospital, surgery was performed in the surgical department. According to Liu Zhongming, secretary of the Organization Department, Minister Liu was shot twice in the waist, from back to front. The bullets were Browning type, while Zhai Yuqing's gun was not a Browning. It was also said that Liu's injuries were quite serious and the danger period had not yet passed. The bullets passed through his waist from behind and fell into his clothes.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Money Shop Redemption Problem</h3>
<p>Money Shop Public Association Agrees on Relief Measures</p>
<p>Market Overcomes Important Period Steadily</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The banknotes issued by the Fuzhou money shops previously, because the Provincial Government ordered them to be directly redeemed, lacked prepared cash, fearing a run on the banks. It was proposed to gradually reduce the amount of大洋 in circulation and issue a kind of "virtual standard" banknotes or commercial bank notes for use in transferring funds between shops. Society opposed this, seeing it as disrupting the currency system and harming finance. Now, this "virtual standard" silver note has been banned by order of the Provincial Government's Currency Law Committee, and the money shops are instructed to: (1) All banknotes issued in the future should still be based on the大洋. (2) This大洋 note should be directly redeemed. (3) For the exchange of banknotes for silver dollars, no premium or surcharge may be requested. The money shops, seeing the agitation of society and the severity of the official attitude, had no choice but to comply and abolish the proposal for silver notes, continuing to issue small silver notes. Starting from March 1, direct redemption was implemented. The price of大洋 was forty or fifty文 higher per dollar than the banknotes, so a premium was required for exchanging notes for silver dollars. This is now gradually falling, becoming the same price as banknotes. However, the ready cash of each money shop is insufficient to supply the large amount of banknotes needed by the market. If all大洋 notes are issued, the problem of simultaneous redemption would be difficult to resolve. Therefore, the Money Shop Public Association has agreed on two relief measures: (1) Only five kinds of大洋 notes will be issued: one dollar, two dollars, three dollars, five dollars, and ten dollars for circulation in the market. (2) For shops who draw notes from the money shops for use in transferring funds, another kind of大洋 white slip starting from a minimum of one hundred dollars in whole numbers will be issued, which will still be redeemed归枰 (meaning the note holder cannot directly redeem from the issuing bank, but shops owing money to the money shop can use this slip to pay off the debt, and each money shop can redeem it themselves.) (3) The government is requested to use silver dollars for the collection of donations and taxes and the issuance of new salaries. The operations of the two national banks, the Central Bank and the Bank of China, and the two foreign banks, HSBC and the Bank of Taiwan, should all use silver dollars. All money shops should use silver dollars for buying and selling Hong Kong and Shanghai drafts. All should not accept大洋 notes, so as to reduce circulation. The Currency Law Committee is currently considering these two proposals. In addition, there is one other matter that is closely related to finance, namely, the price of small silver coins in the city. Each coin was previously worth more than 80文. Since the Provincial Government started minting 20-cent subsidiary coins at the Majiang Silver Dollar Bureau, the price of small silver coins has fallen accordingly, and each coin is now worth only 75文 and cannot be maintained. The livelihood of the common people has been greatly affected, reportedly due to the low quality of the coins. Yesterday, the Currency Law Committee decided to submit a request to the Provincial Government to make the auxiliary coins publicly assayed to show good faith.</p>
<p>As for the market situation in the city, due to the redemption crisis at the end of the lunar year, credit was tight, and turnover was slow. Various merchants went bankrupt one after another, totaling about two million dollars, of which the money merchants suffered the greatest losses from their loans. The second day of the second lunar month, the beginning of the business year, was an important transition period for the market. Merchants, seeing the market depression, anticipated that the shops might have a severe shake-up during that period, and in advance, they specially instructed various brokers to go to each shop to earnestly negotiate that, no matter what, the most important thing was to try their best to maintain the status quo and not to lightly abandon the situation and resort to the inferior tactic of closing shop and fleeing. If they were short of funds by the due date, the merchants were willing to reduce the amount of interest due and wait until after this second day of the lunar month to gradually make up for it, so as not to lose all their capital. The shop would also not collapse. In addition, after that period, the money merchants' old debts could be settled, and new discounts could be issued again. The matter hung by a thread, all depending on this. The shopkeepers also felt that since the merchants were willing to be accommodating, the opportunity for recovery could be avoided. Therefore, the market conditions in the city were able to overcome the difficult period steadily. (March 3)</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Suggestion from the Jiangsu Provincial Party Reorganization Committee to the Central Government to Establish a Foundation for National Direct Trade with National Power</p>
<p>Upon investigation, our country's foreign trade is almost entirely controlled by foreigners. Therefore, our country's goods often cannot freely compete with foreign goods in the world market. Within the country, the procurement and collection of goods are mostly done by foreigners employing our compatriots to do the work for them, and the manipulation and monopoly in between often cause producers or small merchants to suffer. When goods leave the country, they pass through the hands of many parties, and all the profits go to foreigners. Even the name of the place of origin does not belong to our country, which is truly distressing. This is caused by the failure of national policy and the morality of former merchants, as well as various reasons for economic inadequacy. This situation is a great loss to the country's economy and a major obstacle to promoting national products. If we cannot obtain an international commercial position, the so-called promotion of national products will be limited to within the country. Foreign industrial and commercial circles can still plan their opportunities for aggression and oppression at any time. How can this passive approach be sustainable? It is necessary for our country's goods to first obtain an international position, and then proceed to promote them to the outside world, so that the use of patching up leaks will be greatly effective. As for the great plan of establishing a nation, it is even more indispensable. Examining Japan, its situation in the past was the same as our country's today. The adoption of direct trade methods was not long ago, but today it is active all over the world. The adoption of this method is closely related to the adequacy of the economy, so it cannot be established without national power.</p>
<p>Suggestion from the Jiangsu Provincial Party Reorganization Committee to Thoroughly Reorganize the National Tax System and Collection Methods within a Time Limit, Eliminate All Malpractices, and Use National or Local Banks as Tax Collection Agencies to Establish the Independence of the Treasury</p>
<p>Upon investigation, our country's finances, since the Republic of China, have been chaotic layer by layer, almost beyond repair. Fortunately, our Party has overcome everything with its ideology, put down rebellions, and settled military affairs, which is a good opportunity to reorganize finances. In the past, the investigation of the chaos of finances, its main cause is still in the system and the order. If the system is not good, loopholes are everywhere and become the origin of many malpractices in a bad social environment. If the order is not strict, then everything is chaotic, and there is no way to check. Those who cheat can do things calmly. Taking land tax as an example, the鱼鳞 archives are often incomplete, or based on strings of numbers, or relying on cabinet books, and the debts of the people and the losses of the officials cannot be investigated. As for tax collection, it is either contracted or collected, without a fixed method. Ticket books and inspections are even more muddled, so that outsiders cannot understand clearly, nor can they get an inkling of what is underneath. What is even more harmful to merchants and the people is the likin customs checkpoints, where malpractices abound, and they can do their utmost to extort and demand. If there is a good system, and strict audit and investigation are carried out, and if we can do our best to turn private into public, then the income of the nation and local areas will surely increase greatly. This can be said with certainty. Also, examining the biggest malpractice in finance, the collection, expenditure, and safekeeping are all managed by one agency, and the intermingling and misappropriation therein can further encourage corruption. Therefore, we specially suggest formulating a system, eliminating malpractices, and stipulating that national or local banks should be used as tax collection agencies to establish the independence of the treasury. This is the key strategy for reorganizing finances.</p>
<p>Suggestion by Committee Members Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, and Liu Jiwen to Define Increasing Work Efficiency, Developing Industrial Production, Enlightening Workers' Knowledge, Maintaining Workers' Health, and Connecting Workers' Friendship as the Work Standards for Labor Organizations during the Period of Political Tutelage</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal: I believe that at the beginning of political tutelage, construction is in full swing. All of our countrymen should strive to build a foundation for the country. Laborers should also shoulder the responsibility of major construction work. What is the work? Strive to create production to enrich the country's economy. This construction work should be actively sought by labor organizations to benefit themselves and others, but also depends on the consistent supervision and guidance of the central Party and government agencies. Therefore, when the National Government settled the whole country, it strived to reorganize labor organizations to improve their organization and should especially provide guidance according to the times, so that they can engage in construction and devote themselves to the development of production to build a solid foundation for the national economy. Examining various European and American countries, due to the abnormal development of capitalism, laborers are exploited by it, and the government lacks good ways to eliminate and remedy the situation, resulting in laborers having a reaction to seek their own interests through organizations. However, our Party builds the country with the Three Principles of the People and implements a policy for all people. All people from all walks of life with occupations should be protected and cared for without discrimination, so that all people have a spirit of cooperation, and labor and capital have no hidden worries of division. Moreover, our country's production is backward, industry and commerce are declining, and there are frequent disasters, and all industries have been abandoned. We should unite the spirit of the entire nation, help each other, cooperate, and strive together to fight to the death against foreign enemies with aggressive economic policies, and should not divide ourselves into classes, disperse our forces, and create unnecessary disturbances to cut off our own chances of survival. Previously, during the military government period, domestic obstacles had not been removed. Generally, comrades in the labor world, driven by patriotic enthusiasm, in order to gather revolutionary forces, initiated demonstrations of strikes and slowdowns, giving a serious blow to the warlord government, with the aim of promoting national unity and helping the success of the revolution. Their intentions were very good, and the results were significant. Now, times have changed, and the situation is very different. Those who held negative ideas in the past should now change and hold a positive attitude, and those who used destructive methods in the past should now change and engage in construction work. The so-called construction work, in detail, is how to increase work efficiency, how to develop industrial production, how to enlighten workers' knowledge, how to maintain workers' health, and how to connect workers' friendship. All of these are important issues for the workers themselves. They should use a peaceful, quiet, persevering, and resilient spirit, holding the purpose of self-governance, self-improvement, achieving themselves, and achieving others, and seek continuous progress in workers and industry. They should also unite with industrial and commercial enterprises across the country to jointly plan progress and compete in the world market. If they do not know what they are doing, mistakenly take the standard, and want to divide the remaining benefits from the so-called capitalists in the country who are dying to improve their lives and raise their positions, not only is it like climbing a tree to catch fish and will never be possible, but it will also see that domestic production is even more backward, and the wealth of the entire nation will be even more depleted. The direction is completely different from the desired goal. In the past, Germany implemented an eight-hour workday before the European War. After the defeat in the war, the national economy was on the verge of collapse. Workers were concerned about the difficulties of the time and tried to save the situation. The working hours were automatically increased to twelve hours. The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every citizen. Efforts to produce, to strengthen the foundation of the country, the German people's good deeds, is the model of our country, to draw from the party's ideology, is to work for the freedom and equality, mutual aid throughout China, so as to achieve the purpose, so that those who live in it, lives can be improved, the position can be enhanced, otherwise foreign aggression occurs frequently, internal trouble will rise again, and want to seek the benefits of a class at this time, the so-called皮之不存、毛将焉附, not only violates the party's ideology, but also has no way to complete alone. Xiangxi believes that the standard of labor movement in the future is extremely important, it must be "striving to build the cause, as the work standard of labor organizations" can avoid going astray, can notify political party agencies, based on this standard, actively promote and guide, strive to carry out, so that the future of political tutelage, production cause, smooth operation, the happiness of all the people, the blessing of the party and the country, is there any due, respectfully waiting for public resolution,</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Liu Jiwen Three Committee Members Submit the Proposal to Raise Capital Construction Funds</p>
<p>The establishment of the capital and the initiation of construction, setting a model for the whole country and enhancing the views of friendly countries, are of great importance and need not be said. However, the initial operation depends on funding. The capital is jointly owned by the people of the whole country, and its funding should be borne by the people of the whole country. The capital construction committee has now drafted an outline for the construction plan. Once the funds are raised, they can be implemented. Funds should be raised immediately to start construction. It is estimated that the minimum construction funding should be 50 million yuan, based on the national average burden, taking into account the economic situation of various provinces and regions, separately raising 30 million yuan in public debt and allocating 20 million yuan from various provinces and regions, and raising the full amount in the shortest possible time so that capital construction can be completed as soon as possible. A proposal for raising and allocating funds is hereby prepared as follows. Is there anything appropriate, respectfully waiting for public resolution. (Methods) (1) Issuance of Public Debt: The Ministry of Finance will issue 30 million yuan in capital construction public debt, issued in two phases. The first phase is 10 million yuan, and the second phase is 20 million yuan. The principal and interest fund are guaranteed by the customs surplus. (2) Allocation to Various Provinces and Regions: Based on the amount of land tax in each province and the size of the region, they are divided into five grades for allocation, bearing a total of 20 million yuan, to be paid off in three years. The amount allocated to each province and region is listed separately below.</p>

<p>Implementation of County Organization Law in Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>Strict Deadline for Completion by the End of June This Year</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, after careful consideration of the implementation of the county organization law, considering that the local conditions of the counties in the province are different, should review the case of the Zhejiang County Organization Law Modification Handling with the affiliated bureaus and offices, and then the Provincial Government will review and resolve the issue in a meeting. The first phase of the reorganization of the county government is allowed to be implemented in stages and will first reorganize and establish the eighteen counties of Hangzhou, Haining, Wuxing, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, Changxing, Xiaoshan, Yuyao, Pinghu, Haiyan, Jiashan, Shangyu, Cixi, Yin County, Zhenhai, Deqing, Chongde, and Tongxiang. The remaining fifty-seven counties will be given additional funding as appropriate. The second phase of delimiting county districts will also be handled separately by the Civil Affairs Department in accordance with the implementation deadline decided by the National Government, and the seventy-five county magistrates will be notified to comply, and the department will send personnel to conduct a survey and approve the record. However, the district offices have not been fully organized because the township organizations have not been carried out at the same time, and the third step of preparing for district and township affairs for the implementation of the county organization law will also be delayed. It is now learned that the Provincial Government has received a telegram from the National Government, requiring the province to implement the county organization law and must complete it by the end of June of the 19th year in accordance with the approved extension. It has specially instructed the Civil Affairs Department to inform and strictly urge the county magistrates. It is also heard that a disciplinary measure has been formulated for the county magistrates who are slow to progress in the future to promote supervision.</p>

<p>Attempted Suicide Foiled and Rescued. A young man named Guo Maolin, 19 years old, lived at No. 1 Caijia Garden, Erlang Temple, Nanjing. He was an upper-level clerk in the Secretariat of the Ministry of Military Affairs. On the 28th of last month, he took leave to travel to Hangzhou. One day, he met a woman on the train from Hangzhou to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, they stayed in a hotel together. Unexpectedly, the woman took Guo's luggage, a camera, and more than 60 yuan in cash, and left. Guo, feeling ashamed to face anyone, attempted suicide by jumping into the river at the Bund in the French Concession. He was rescued and accompanied to the North Station on the 5th, where he was given a ticket and ordered to return to his hometown by train. Who knew that after Guo's train arrived at Suzhou Station, he got off the train and checked into Room No. 9 of the Suzhou Hotel for the night. The next afternoon, Guo went out alone and wandered around on the road for a long time. When he reached the New Yanmenwai South New Bridge, he saw a toilet and went to the toilet. He used hemp rope to hang himself from the beam. He was rescued and lowered by someone. He had not died. After passers-by inquired about his background, he claimed to be staying at the Suzhou Hotel. So he was escorted to the hotel. Xue Yunlong, the manager of the hotel, saw that Guo's clothes were wet from the rain and noticed that his attitude had changed. He inquired with the person who came with him and learned that he had attempted suicide. Fearing that Guo would still have an accident, he reported it to the Fifth Precinct. Patrol Officer Gu Haoru took the police to the scene and took Guo, a bamboo basket, and a hemp rope to the police station. Zhang, the clerk, interrogated him.

The Municipal Preparatory Office specially resolved at the previous office meeting to notify citizens and inform the First District Office to notify the township and town chiefs and deputies to automatically initiate fundraising and provide subsidies, so that the work can be repaired. Citizens Sun Xiying, Wu Tingmei, and others believe that the rickshaw donations collected by the Municipal Office were originally intended for road repairs. Therefore, in the past, the Municipal Office would immediately send workers to repair any damaged streets reported by citizens without requiring citizens to pay any additional fees. Now, the rickshaw donations are as high as more than 1,600 yuan per month, but the streets in the city have not been repaired for a long time. The Municipal Office should quickly repair them and should no longer ask the people to donate money. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Road Widening Committee requesting Director Sun to handle the matter immediately to alleviate the people's difficulties and improve the city's appearance.</p>

It also clarified the contract tax rate and various surtaxes that were approved to be collected, clarified the types and amounts, made wooden signs, and hung them up for public knowledge. County Magistrate Zhu believed that the donations for education, public welfare, and fire protection were based on old cases, and that if they were canceled all at once before relief measures were devised, the impact would be significant. In addition to explaining the reasons why they could not be canceled in a telegram to the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Education Departments that night, he also went to the province by car on the morning of the 7th to personally explain everything to the departments and request instructions.</p>
<p>Meeting on Regulating People's Food Supply. The Wu County Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of the rice industry at 2 p.m. on the 6th to discuss ways to regulate the people's food supply due to the rising rice prices. More than a dozen rice industry representatives and chamber of commerce members attended. After discussion, it was concluded that the local autumn harvest last year was poor, and there was not much rice in storage. The price of rice from other places was high, and the supply was scarce. The only way to regulate the supply at present is to purchase small-sized rice in bulk to provide relief so that the market price does not rise again.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Strict Urging of Industrial Special Police Brigade to Move to Defense. The Department of Civil Affairs previously ordered the First Brigade of the Nantong-Taizhou-Hai'an Industrial Special Police Brigade to be stationed in Nantong, the Second Brigade to be stationed in Haimen, and the Third Brigade to be stationed in Dongtai. Now, Director Miao believes that the brigade commanders have not complied with the order for two months and has strictly urged them to move to their defense posts as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Police and Militia Jointly Suppress Bandits. Bandits are causing serious disturbances in the Yudong, Sanyi, and Yuxi districts of Nantong, causing great harm. The county government has now dispatched a machine gun team to join the police and militia to encircle and suppress the bandits from the Sibaba in different directions. The bandits retreated after two hours of fierce fighting. County Magistrate Chen believes that the bandits are in contact with pirates from the outer seas and has telegraphed the province to send shallow-water warships to block the pirate ships in ports such as Huanben.</p>

It has ordered the issuance of group defense measures and ordered immediate discussion, reply, and verification for implementation. County Magistrate Chen has discussed and replied to each district separately for submission and verification.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Director of Education Dismissed Due to the Education Tide, Offers Three Points in Defense. Lin Youming, Director of the Education Bureau, was dismissed due to the education tide. Lin was unwilling to accept the dismissal and submitted three points to the county government for transfer to the provincial government for defense: (1) Unfair expenditure. The expenses of the county's public schools were borrowed in the name of the school principals, and the surtaxes under the Mangcao item were deducted and repaid. This was done in accordance with the order, and the footing was stable. There was no intention of favoring one over the other. Youming came from a foreign land and was impartial, without villains or relatives. If it is considered that the measures were inappropriate, then there is nothing to be done. (2) Detaining the principals. On December 6, 70 or 80 people came to the bureau, claiming to demand the arrears. They demanded, roared, and threatened until late at night. At that time, they received instructions from the Department of Education to strictly investigate the reactionary circumstances of teachers and staff. Jiangyin was also under special martial law. The principals and others were unreasonably making trouble, which may have had other effects. In short, this case has another hidden effect. There are traces and evidence to be found. (3) Not in accordance with the circumstances. It is not known where the so-called circumstances are. Since the salary demands occurred, one dog barked at a shadow, and a hundred dogs barked at the sound. Flyers and declarations were flying like snowflakes. If Lin Youming's crimes were heinous and irreconcilable, in fact, only three or four people from the Three Division faction initiated it.</p>
<p>The Peach Blossom Township Robbery Case is Solved and Escorted for Interrogation. The home of Qi You, a farmer in Taohuaxiang, Sixth District, was robbed on January 26, with a loss of about 200 or 300 yuan. On the 29th, the victim met the bandit child Zhang Ruilin at the Hefeng Pawnshop in Xushu, Wujin, who was pawning clothes. He was immediately arrested and escorted to the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau for detention. Unexpectedly, he escaped the next day. He was recaptured by the Licheng Security Regiment. Five thieves, Zhang Peisheng, Zhang Peilin, Zhang Chenglin, Xia Gouda, He Jiming, and others, were escorted to the bureau for the case. To search for the original loot and for certain relationships, the suspects and 33 pieces of men's and women's clothing were not escorted to the headquarters until yesterday (5th). According to Zhang Peisheng, Zhang Ruilin is his son. Zhang Peilin ordered him to pawn the items. He did not know about stealing from Qi's home. Peilin initiated the idea. Zhang Chenglin said that he did not know about it beforehand. Xia Gouda and He Jiming both said that they went to Qi's home with Peilin to steal things, and they each used two yuan in silver at the time. After the interrogation, a document will be prepared and transferred to the county for handling.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Establishment of Military-Political Security Office. Due to winter defense, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs established a joint military-political office in the provincial capital last year. It has been in operation for several months and has achieved considerable results. Now that the winter defense period has passed, reactionary elements are still inciting chaos. Therefore, the Department of Civil Affairs convened a joint military-political security meeting of the provincial capital at 2 p.m. yesterday, chaired by Zhang Zhongli, the chief of the Third Section of the Department of Civil Affairs. It was proposed that a joint security office must be established to determine the name of the agency. It was decided to name it the Joint Military-Political Security Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Capital. Then, security measures were proposed. It was resolved that the Fifth District of the Water Public Security Brigade would be responsible for reconnaissance and defense in the Jiangbei area, from Shierxu and Guazhou in the north, to Zhongli, Liuxu, Huojiaqiao, Simali, and Gangkou, and to Jiangyin in the south. Several patrol ships were dispatched to patrol back and forth. The Provincial Police Headquarters was responsible for reconnaissance and defense near the provincial capital for dozens of miles inside and outside, from Danyang in the south and its main roads. The Military Police Regiment was responsible for reconnaissance and defense from Gaozhi in the west, to Jurong in the southwest, and its main roads. The County Police Brigade was responsible for reconnaissance and defense from Dantu Town in the east and its main roads. Every day, military and police units were rotated to prepare for emergencies and were dispatched to designated locations for alert. The remaining units were all increased. The Provincial Public Security Bureau was responsible for maintaining order in the provincial capital and for paying close attention and conducting strict patrols. Students from the police school and police instructor school were ordered to assist in everything to ensure the security of the provincial capital.</p>
<p>Requesting the Revocation of the Order to Abolish the Chamber of Commerce Association. The Jiangsu Provincial Five-Committee Committee for Farmers, Industry, Commerce, Women, and Youth believes that the Standing Committee of the Central Committee resolved that the new Chamber of Commerce Law and the Industrial and Commercial Guild Law have been promulgated by the government after being formulated by the Legislative Yuan. From now on, the organization of merchant groups should comply with the newly promulgated laws and regulations. There is no need for the existence of the Merchant and Civilian Association, which was established to meet the needs of the times. After careful discussion, it was felt that there were inconveniences in following the facts of the old Chamber of Commerce and the current situation of merchants and civilians.

Battalion Commander Li, who purchased a ticket to board the ferry, negotiated with the sailors about the cabin. The tea boy did not understand the local dialect, and there was a misunderstanding between them, resulting in a conflict. The ferry is still being detained, and it is not known how it will be resolved.</p>

On the other hand, it telegraphed the province to request the dispatch of large troops to suppress the bandits. After receiving the telegram, the province immediately dispatched the Second Company of the Provincial Security Brigade, led by Battalion Commander Wang. They arrived in Pinghu at about 8 p.m. the day before yesterday and stayed overnight in the Dongmen Cocoon Factory and Yimiao Temple. At 8 a.m. yesterday, Battalion Commander Wang led all the soldiers, accompanied by the county magistrate and the water police, hired a small steamer to go to Newcang to suppress the bandits.

In order to supplement the province's construction expenses, the Zhejiang Department of Finance is negotiating with the chambers of commerce and money shops in the five counties of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing to mortgage construction bonds worth 2.4 million yuan. In addition to directly borrowing 300,000 yuan from the Bank of China, the funds allocated to the various counties for special temporary subsidies and the principal and interest of various loans due are estimated to total about 5 million yuan. It is difficult to raise funds. The department has ordered the sections to investigate and draft a plan for submission to the provincial government meeting for discussion on relief measures.</p>

The Zhejiang Department of Civil Affairs has notified all counties of the transportation methods and assembly points for immigration and cultivation in the Northeast.

<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Seizure of Guo Huizhen's Private Property. Guo Huizhen, the former magistrate of Xiaoshan County, absconded with funds when the National Army entered Zhejiang. The provincial civil and financial departments ordered an investigation into the deficit, which totaled 61,000 yuan. Guo's ancestral home is Houguan, Fujian. The two departments, believing that the handover was not clear and the deficit was huge, published a notice limiting the payment. They dared to ignore it and were extremely bold. They specially requested the Executive Yuan to transfer the request to the National Government for an explicit arrest and pursuit. They also ordered the local officials in the ancestral home to seize the private property of the magistrate in advance for compensation. Fire in Zhujiatan Village. A fire broke out accidentally in the mansions of the Zhu, Yan, and Chen families in Zhujiatan Village outside the East Gate of Xiaoshan at about 9 p.m. on the 3rd and lasted for two hours.

The disaster victims escaped in single clothes and were injured in falls and burns, which was very tragic.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>

The Shaoxing County Government received an order from the province yesterday to encourage the public to migrate to the Northeast for cultivation in order to provide relief. County Magistrate Tang ordered the village and neighborhood associations to widely encourage the public. All residents who are willing to immigrate should report their names, ages, and number of people to the county through the associations before March 25 for transfer.</p>
<p>Levying Educational Surcharge on Land Tax. The Shaoxing Education Bureau stated that the educational funds for the 18th year were affected by the land rent, and there was a shortfall of approximately 27,000 yuan compared with the budget.

<h3>Sino-Japanese Tariff Negotiations Hold Formal Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting and Finance Minister Song Ziwen Both Attended</p>
<p>Both Sides' Opinions Gradually Approaching</p>
<p>To Continue Discussions in Shanghai Within Days</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese tariff issue, after repeated negotiations between Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, together with Finance Minister Song Ziwen, and Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu Mamoru, has shown some progress. Yesterday morning at 10:30, another meeting was held at the Foreign Affairs Discussion Society. The Chinese attendees were Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, Finance Minister Song Ziwen, and Xu Mo, Director of the European and American Affairs Department. The Japanese side was represented by Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu Mamoru and Shigemitsu's secretary. The meeting adjourned at 1:30 PM.</p>
<p>The detailed proceedings are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Meeting Content</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:45, Foreign Minister Wang arrived at the Foreign Affairs Discussion Society first and immediately telegraphed Shigemitsu to come for discussion quickly. Shigemitsu and others arrived at 10:00, and Song Ziwen also arrived at 10:30, whereupon the formal meeting began. First, the various articles that had been agreed upon in previous discussions were sorted out. Then, the issue of reciprocal tariff rates and the types of reciprocal goods were discussed, with much debate. Regarding the effective period of the agreement, the Japanese side strongly advocated setting it at five years, while the Chinese side strongly advocated shortening it. However, in general, the opinions of both sides were very close.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting States</h3>
<p>After the meeting adjourned, Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting told this newspaper's reporter, "Today's meeting was to discuss the Sino-Japanese tariff issue. The opinions of both sides have gradually approached, but formal signing will still require several more meetings. It is feared that it will be difficult to accomplish this in the shortest period of time. Before I return to Beijing, I may need to convene another meeting in Shanghai. The date has not yet been determined."</p>
<h3>Xu Mo's Remarks</h3>
<p>This newspaper's reporter visited Mr. Xu Mo at his residence last night and inquired about the meeting's results. According to him, "I am not a designated commissioner for the meeting. My coming to Shanghai this time was a coincidence. Minister Wang invited me to participate, so I am not very clear about the content. The various articles discussed today are roughly the same as the tariff agreements signed with various countries. It is expected that the future Sino-Japanese tariff agreement will not have any special points. As for reciprocal tariff rates, they are very common internationally, and each country has its special goods, so it is impossible to invoke the example of Country B to make demands. As for the types of reciprocal goods, they were not mentioned in the meeting, as this is a matter for specialized commissioners and cannot be resolved hastily. Judging from the situation of today's meeting, it proceeded very smoothly, but formal signing may still require another meeting in Shanghai within days."</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Welcoming the Danish Crown Prince</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, accompanied by Xu Mo, Director of the European and American Affairs Department, arrived in Shanghai by night train from Beijing at 7:00 yesterday morning. At 9:45 yesterday morning, Foreign Minister Wang went to the office of the Foreign Affairs Discussion Society on Avenue Joffre. The Sino-Japanese tariff meeting was held at 10:30 (see the above article). He also instructed Chen Shiguang, the director of the office, to purchase a pair of antique vases and several pieces of embroidery as special gifts for the Danish Crown Prince and royal family who are visiting China this time. Foreign Minister Wang also plans to personally greet them at the New Customs Wharf on the morning of the 9th and is scheduled to return to Beijing by train on Monday night next week.</p>
<h3>Danish Crown Prince Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>Landing at the New Customs Wharf</p>
<p>The Danish Crown Prince and royal family's visit to China arrived in Shanghai on the Fenella ship from Hong Kong on the 6th. They are expected to arrive at Wusongkou at 7:00 tomorrow morning. At that time, the Naval Reorganization Office will dispatch a small steamer to greet them and take them directly to the New Customs Wharf to land. The Foreign Affairs Office sent a letter to the Garrison Headquarters yesterday, requesting that a military band be sent to the wharf to welcome them.</p>
<h3>Negotiations to Recover the French Concession Police Headquarters</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is Only Making Preliminary Contact</p>
<p>This newspaper's reporter interviewed an important figure in diplomatic circles yesterday, inquiring about the recent progress in recovering the French Concession Police Headquarters. According to the reply, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been preparing to recover the French Concession Police Headquarters for a long time, but recently it is still in the stage of preliminary contact. Formal discussions are still far away. When asked whether there has been any recent development in the Sino-French treaty revision negotiations, the reply was that the French side is using the new tax in Guangxi Province as an excuse to delay negotiations. In reality, the signing of the Sino-French commercial treaty is of no benefit to the French side, so they are resorting to all kinds of difficulties and delaying tactics.</p>
<h3>Cancellation of the Sino-American Aviation Contract</h3>
<p>Direct Negotiations by Wang Boqun</p>
<p>The Results are Quite Good and Can Be Resolved Soon</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of canceling the Sino-American aviation contract, according to reliable sources in diplomatic circles yesterday, it has recently been directly negotiated in Beijing by Wang Boqun, Chairman of the China National Aviation Corporation, and the American Flying Transport Company. The results are quite good and should be resolved in the short term. Because the Flying Transport Company is not operated by the American government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is only playing a participating role in the negotiations.</p>

If it fails to abolish and disband within the time limit, the final steps will be taken to deal with it, etc., therefore, a declaration was specially issued yesterday, requesting the central government to seriously negotiate and party departments in various places to oppose it in unison.</p>
<h3>Traces of Contemporary Figures</h3>

<h3>Johnson's Speech on the Shanghai Concession Problem</h3>
<p>The United Nations Association held a public banquet for Mr. Johnson, the American Minister to China, at its clubhouse on Beijing Road at noon yesterday. More than a hundred Chinese and foreign people attended. Mr. Cunningham, the American Consul General in Shanghai, presided over the meeting and delivered a welcome speech. Minister Johnson gave a reply speech on the topic of the Shanghai Concession Problem, which was the first public speech given by Mr. Johnson since he became Minister to China. The full text of his speech is translated below:</p>
<p>Minister Johnson said, "About eighty years ago, a number of foreign merchants brought goods from their home countries to the Bund to trade with the Chinese. They obtained permission to purchase land and establish businesses. Soon, from residences to offices, from offices to warehouses, and from warehouses to ships, they realized the need for streets, patrolling streets, directing traffic, and providing lighting. From their demands arose the need to cooperate with the local Chinese, because they were the masters of the commercial port. The result of the cooperation between Chinese and foreign merchants was the creation of the most prosperous market in the East. The Shanghai International Settlement stands proudly today, a magnificent memorial arch built through the goodwill cooperation of various nationalities to achieve a common goal. The result of international cooperation is something that both Chinese and foreigners can be proud of, and they feel that it can greatly demonstrate the achievements of business groups working together without the help of the government. It is impossible to limit its importance. It can be said that any enthusiastic person who comes to this place will shout wildly, 'Oh, I never imagined that here, I could witness the supreme grace of internationalism!' Since the cooperation between Chinese and foreigners has created such a monument, in the future, Chinese and foreigners must cooperate to protect and maintain this city. Everyone feels that it is extremely important. Shanghai accounts for a large part of Eastern commerce. People from various countries collect certain taxes in this commerce for transportation costs, water freight, interest, port fees, or tariffs, etc. Once cooperation is stopped, countless people will be overturned. Since merchants gather here, the branches and tributaries will spread widely, and the homes of workers and the mansions of wealthy merchants can be said to be everywhere. And what cannot be ignored most is the impact on the government's tax revenue from the huge commerce passing through this port. The so-called monument to international effort, Shanghai, will succeed with continued cooperation and be destroyed with the cessation of cooperation."</p>
<h3>League of Nations Far East Opium Investigation Team Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>No Investigation in Shanghai</p>
<p>To Go to Dalian Next Week</p>
<p>The three members of the International League of Nations Far East Opium Investigation Committee, Holck-Larsen, Jurad, and Havlásek, departed from Geneva, passed through India, Annam, the South Seas Islands, and Hong Kong, and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. They will go to Dalian next week. It is heard that these three are passing through Shanghai by chance and have no investigation task.</p>
<h3>Organization and Mission</h3>
<p>The chief member of the delegation, Holck-Larsen, told this newspaper's reporter yesterday that the delegation was commissioned by the League of Nations and composed of three countries that have no vested interest in the opium issue. He is Swedish, one of the others is Belgian, and one is Czech. Their mission is to go to the invited countries to investigate the situation of opium smoking and trafficking, and report the investigation results to the League of Nations. The League of Nations originally scheduled to hold a ban on opium conference last year, but it has been decided to postpone it to next year to wait for their report. As for how the League of Nations will handle it later, he cannot say on its behalf. They have already passed through India, Annam, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, the South Seas Islands, French Indochina, the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, and Macau. Because they were not invited in Shanghai, they will not investigate. They are scheduled to go to Dalian, Shenyang, and other places next week.</p>
<h3>Anti-Drug Association Does Not Recognize the Visiting Far East Opium Investigation Team</h3>
<p>The Opium Advisory Committee of the League of Nations sent personnel to organize the Far East Opium Investigation Team, refusing Chinese representatives to join the investigation, and the scope of the investigation is limited to the Far East, which is greatly unfair in terms of legal principles. The Chinese representative Wang Jingqi, Minister to the Hague, raised objections. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association is even more dissatisfied with the organization of the delegation and has repeatedly opposed it and is planning response methods. The delegation has arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday, they specially went to the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association to inquire about the association's views on the delegation's visit to China. The following is a verbatim record of it. The association had previously issued a declaration stating that the scourge of opium and narcotic drugs is spread all over the world. Imperialist countries, such as Britain, Japan, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Germany, have taken it as a tool for economic aggression and the vanguard of military aggression. Because guns and warships can only be used for combat, opium poisons can be used anytime and anywhere by taking advantage of unequal treaties and consular jurisdiction. As a result, not only economic benefits are obtained, but also the country can be destroyed and the people annihilated. It is the most ruthless policy and the most profound crime in the international community. Anyone with a little conscience is heartbroken and eager to find a way to eliminate it and seek a glimmer of life for world humanity. Previously, various countries have repeatedly convened ban conferences, and they have signed conventions and mutually believed in adherence, but in the end, countries that produce opium and narcotics have no sincerity and deceive each other with diplomatic means, causing the scourge of opium to spread and increase day by day. And our country, which has always been contested by the great powers, has become the world's largest market for drugs. The disaster is vast and cannot be cleaned up. Thinking of this, the pain is extreme. In 1924, the League of Nations convened a ban on opium conference, hoping that the sincerity of all countries would be combined to jointly eliminate opium and narcotics. Our people, because of the promotion of the anti-drug movement, thought that there would be international support, but the representatives of Britain, Japan, and other countries only sought the interests of their own opium merchants, disregarded humanity, and were blinded by profit, which resulted in our country's proposal to restrict the manufacture of narcotics not being passed, and blamed our country for producing too much opium, causing it to be the culprit for destroying the world's ban on opium, which caused the meeting to end without results. Recently, the Opium Advisory Committee, based on the suggestion of the British representative, organized the Far East Opium Investigation Team and sent commissioners to our country and various countries in the Far East to investigate the opium situation. Although it has been unanimously opposed by our country from top to bottom, the delegation is still actively coming. Examining its intentions, it is nothing more than seeking evidence of our country's lax opium ban in order to provide a basis for interfering in our country's internal affairs, and to expose our country's inferiority to the world so that our country will become the target of public criticism at next year's international ban on opium conference. Therefore, the area of ​​investigation is limited to the Far East, the scope of investigation is limited to opium, the selection of investigators excludes our country's representatives, and the cost of investigation comes from the League's public funds. What could be more unfair than this? Our association is concerned about national affairs and hates the scourge of drugs. It believes that this investigation is inappropriate. If the League of Nations sincerely intends to eliminate the world's drug scourge, it should adopt fair and stable methods, accommodate our country's opinions, expand the area of ​​investigation to countries all over the world, not just limited to the Far East, the scope of investigation should include narcotics, not just limited to opium, and the organization of the delegation should have our country's representatives join, so that it can be fair. The delegation is still actively coming to China despite our country's opposition. It can be seen that its intentions are ill-conceived and its actions are illegal. In addition to publishing the unfair points of the delegation to the world and exposing the reality of foreign drugs entering China, we deeply hope that compatriots across the country will, on the one hand, urge the government to strictly enforce the opium ban to avoid providing an excuse for foreigners, and on the other hand, resist foreign drugs, expose their policy of harming China and seek world public opinion. The association absolutely does not recognize the delegation's visit to China.</p>
<h3>International Exchange Conference Does Not Send Representatives</h3>
<p>The International Conference on Uniform Laws for Bills of Exchange, Promissory Notes, and Checks is scheduled to hold a general meeting at the League of Nations in Geneva on May 12 this year. Zhao Jinqing, the Economic Commissioner of the Economic Committee of the conference in China, received a letter from the International Conference requesting that representatives be sent. After the conference sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting that representatives be appointed to attend the meeting, it received a reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which stated that this conference is extremely important, but it concerns economics and should be appointed by the Ministry of Finance. However, the Ministry of Finance replied that it is not necessary to send representatives this year and that it will handle it at the next meeting. After receiving the letter, Commissioner Zhao has already sent a letter to the League of Nations for verification.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Commissioners Set Sail Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cheng Zhenjun, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and Director of the Construction Department (it was mistakenly reported in yesterday's newspaper as Director of the Civil Affairs Department), and Liu Yiyan, a specialist member of the National Government's Construction Committee and Deputy Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau, were dispatched by the Zhejiang Provincial Government to visit various European and American countries to investigate construction administration and other important construction matters. They set off on the President Madison of the Dollar Steamship Company on the 7th to Japan. It is heard that they will investigate in Japan for two weeks and then go to the United States, where they will stay for about six weeks, and then transfer from Britain to Belgium, Germany, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, and other countries. In addition to investigating construction administration, such as organizational systems, material selection, and personnel recruitment, they will also do their best to investigate and study power generation, farmland irrigation, artificial silk, railway factories, and other undertakings. For this trip abroad, Cheng and Liu have been assisted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Zhejiang Provincial Government by sending telegrams to the envoys of various countries, and there have also been considerable contacts with consuls and foreign firms in various countries. Although the investigation period is only five months, the two gentlemen are very familiar with the situation in Europe and America. After returning to China after this investigation, they will definitely make great contributions to the construction undertaking.</p>
<p>Cheng Zhenjun and Liu Yiyan</p>
<h3>New General Manager of Commercial Press, Mr. Wang Yunwu, Goes Abroad for Investigation</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Yunwu has served as the Director of the Compilation and Translation Department of the Commercial Press for a long time. His rich knowledge has long been known to the Chinese people. His greatest contributions in recent years are one, inventing the Four-Corner Code Indexing Method, which has been adopted by no less than one million people at home and abroad within two years, and two, creating and compiling the Complete Library, which has led to the establishment of thousands of new small libraries in various parts of the country within a few months. Mr. Wang resigned from the position of Director of the Compilation and Translation Department of the Commercial Press due to overwork last summer and was appointed Director of the Legal System Group of the Social Science Research Institute of the National Central Research Institute. He is currently engaged in large-scale and thorough research on the issue of crime in our country. Last winter, due to the death of Mr. Bao Xianchang, the General Manager of the Commercial Press, the company's board of directors elected Mr. Wang to succeed him. For several months, Mr. Wang firmly declined, but he agreed to temporarily assume the title and first go to Europe, America, and Japan to investigate everything for about half a year before returning to China to take up the position of General Manager of the Commercial Press. Mr. Wang set off on the President Madison of the Dollar Steamship Company yesterday (the 7th).</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yunwu</p>
<h3>Honors of Wu Jingxiong in the United States</h3>
<p>Dr. Wu Jingxiong, Dean of the Soochow Law School on Kunshan Road in this port, went to the United States on December 28 last year at the invitation of Northwestern and Harvard Universities. The school received a letter from Dr. Wigmore, Dean of Northwestern University, stating that Mr. Wu arrived in Seattle on January 13 and in St. Paul on the 17th. The Bar Association of the city immediately invited him to give a lecture on the 22nd because of his reputation. He transferred to Chicago. All the Chinese students of the University of Chicago Law School and representatives of the school's Education Department came to the station to welcome him. On the 24th, he gave a lecture at the Department of Political Science of the University of Chicago. On the 25th, the Dean of Northwestern University and the President of the Student Union hosted a public banquet for Mr. Wu and, at the request of Mr. Rosenthal's son, visited the Commercial and Other Courts of Chicago. When the court was hearing a case of international public law, Mr. Wu was present. All the magistrates stood up to pay their respects. After being introduced by the President of the court, Mr. Wu was specially invited to sit with them and observe the trial and consult on everything. This is the first honor that a Chinese person has received in the American judiciary. On the 26th, at the invitation of the Consular Corps of Chicago, he gave a lecture at the Ji Hui Hall of Northwestern University on the topic of Consular Jurisdiction and China. There were representatives from seventeen countries, but the Chinese Consul was the only one absent, which Mr. Wu deeply regretted. On the 27th and 28th, he gave lectures at the Northwestern University Law School. There were more than 600 professors, magistrates, and students in attendance. Mr. Wu's topics were one, Ancient Chinese Jurisprudence, and two, a Comparison of the Old and New Legal Systems of China. Mr. Wu criticized Chinese and foreign legal systems with a philosophical perspective and summarized the evolution of law in China for thousands of years into a coherent chapter, which he instilled in the minds of tens of thousands of people in two hours. Mr. Wei called it a model speech and the same success as Professor Howeiss's lecture at the school three years ago. Mr. Wu's remarks are regarded as treasures by the American press. His speeches are published in local newspapers and benefit tens of thousands of people. If he can give more lectures at various American societies, it will surely increase American goodwill towards China. Finally, he said that the Northwestern University Library intends to compile a book on the History of Chinese Legal System and asked Dr. Sheng Zhenwei to collect materials on his behalf and expressed his gratitude. According to the Northwestern University Law School's Rosenthal Foundation Lecture Series, it was donated by the great industrialist Rosenthal and is specially used to invite world legal scholars to give lectures. Mr. Wu was selected for this, which is the only glory for our East Asia.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>To Fly Back to Fukuoka Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The Shanghai news of the Japanese News Alliance on the 7th, the Sino-Japanese liaison test flight by the Japan Air Transport Company from Fukuoka to Shanghai, was extended by two days due to the hurricane. Today, it was finally held. Although the weather was not good, the first test flight has been completed. The pilot Fujimoto and five staff members took a Dornier seaplane (which can seat twelve people) and departed from Fukuoka Meijima Airport at 7:49 AM (Shanghai time) and flew over Tomie, Goto at 9:13 AM. They landed on the Yangshupu water surface at 12:38 PM. The flight distance was 950 kilometers, the speed per hour was 107 knots, and the flight time was 4 hours and 51 minutes. This time it was a test flight and there were no passengers. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 8:00 AM on the 9th and fly back to Fukuoka. The pilot Fujimoto said, "This morning at 6:00, we received weather reports from Jeju Island and Tomie saying that there were clouds but no rain in the Shanghai area, so we flew. When we passed Tomie, we encountered heavy rain, followed by headwinds of 10 to 15 meters. Because the dense clouds were too low, the plane could only fly 200 meters above the sea surface. If there was no wind, the flight time should be 5 and a half hours. Because we were flying with the wind, we were able to shorten the time by one and a half hours. We saw three ships along the way.

<h3>Municipal Government Orders the Social Affairs Bureau to Crack Down on Profiteering Merchants Hoarding Grain</h3>
<p>Instructing the Public Safety Bureau to Order Strict Enforcement</p>
<p>The Municipal Government, in order to comply with orders to crack down on profiteering merchants hoarding grain and to maintain the people's food supply, has specifically instructed the Social Affairs Bureau as follows: "For the matter of issuing instructions, a document No. 177 from the Ministry of Interior Affairs has been approved, stating that it is a matter for requesting instructions. A directive No. 311 from the Executive Yuan was received, which stated, 'A document No. 473 from the Secretariat of the National Government was approved, stating that a letter from the Central Political Council concerning the Executive Yuan's report on the food problem and the proposed measures by various departments has been received. The meeting of this council has resolved to approve the measures proposed by the Ministry of Interior Affairs regarding the crackdown on profiteering merchants. Please forward this for compliance and a response.' An edict was received instructing the Executive Yuan to forward this for compliance. In addition to replying to the letter, a copy of the original document is enclosed to be forwarded for your information and action.' This has been approved. Apart from replying to the letter for submission and issuing separate orders to the Ministry of Finance, the original documents and attachments are hereby copied and issued, instructing the relevant departments to comply and report separately." This has been received. Upon investigation, this case was previously submitted to the Executive Yuan for deliberation, and it was determined that to crack down on profiteering merchants smuggling grain for export, the Ministry of Finance should first issue a general order to customs to strictly prohibit it. Regarding the crackdown on profiteering merchants hoarding grain and the prevention of improper grain consumption, it was proposed that this department instruct the provinces and halls to strictly crack down based on local conditions, and a request for review was submitted. Now, in accordance with the aforementioned reasons, in addition to replying and issuing separate instructions, a document is hereby sent to your government for review and instruction to your subordinates to strictly crack down to maintain the people's food supply, and to report the crackdown measures for reference." This has been approved. It is hereby ordered that the bureau, in conjunction with the Public Safety Bureau, instruct its subordinates to strictly crack down and report the crackdown measures for verification and onward transmission. This order.</p>
<h3>Agreed Measures for County Public Safety Expenses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County public safety expenses have been in a state of limbo for a long time, with no solution. Therefore, the county government convened a meeting of the heads of various bureaus and districts under the county yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the county government conference hall to discuss raising regular expenses for the county Public Safety Bureau. Over a dozen people, including County Head Leng, attended. Leng Jun chaired the meeting, and Hu Gongshou served as the recorder. The meeting proceeded according to protocol. After the chairman's report, discussion began. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The details of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendees: County Head Leng Jun, Secretary Fan Shuhan, Section Chief Xu Xiaochu of the First Section, Section Chief Qian Tingbi of the Second Section, Public Safety Shen Jinghua, Finance Li Zuyong, Zhang Pengfei, Jiang Lichuan of the Property Office, Yang Fulin of the Second District, Bi Huan of the Fourth District, Ren Yongkang of the Fifth District, and eleven others.</p>
<p>Report Items: After the meeting proceeded according to protocol, the chairman gave a report, stating, "The county's public safety expenses have been in a state of limbo for a long time, and the difficulties are indescribable. Today's meeting is convened to ask everyone to jointly discuss measures to fundamentally solve this most urgent problem." After the chairman's report, Public Safety Bureau Chief Shen Jinghua reported, stating, "The establishment of the police is to maintain the local area. Expenses should also be allocated on time. Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners mix, and the population is diverse. The issue of defense is extremely important. Our bureau and its subordinate branches have only about 200 officers and police in total. It is already difficult to maintain the county's security with this number. Moreover, the monthly salary of the officers and police is only half that of the Municipal Bureau. Life is particularly difficult. Recently, there has been no funding at all, and we are on the verge of starvation. The monthly regular expenses for the county and the four branch bureaus total more than 3,920 yuan. In the past, the municipal government allocated funds from the city's property tax revenue each month according to the amount. Since June of last year, the allocation has been stopped, and the public safety expenses have suddenly become unavailable. County Head Leng has repeatedly transferred funds from other sources to provide some relief. Recently, all resources have been exhausted and there is no way to continue. Only half of the salary for January of this year has been paid, and the salary for February is overdue. If measures are not taken urgently, it will be impossible to support it. In total, the annual regular expenses for our bureau and the four branch bureaus are about 47,000 yuan. The cost of clothing and temporary expenses is about 7,300 yuan. The annual total is 54,300 yuan. Jinghua has not been in office for long and is unfamiliar with the people and the place. To seek remedies, I rely on everyone's efforts. What measures should be taken to first raise the arrears and then pay the salaries on a monthly basis to eliminate this problem?"</p>
<p>Resolutions: Resolutions on measures to raise regular expenses for the Public Safety Bureau: (1) In accordance with the resolutions of the first and second administrative meetings, property tax should be reorganized. The county government should immediately send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation of the actual rents, verify the tax amount, together with the district chiefs and public safety branch chiefs. (2) The county head and the Public Safety Bureau chief should submit a report to the provincial government and the municipal government to liquidate the accounts and consult with the municipal government to continue the allocation as before. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Defense After the End of the Winter Defense Period</h3>
<p>Instructions from the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command recently issued instructions to its military and police agencies, stating that although the winter defense period has ended, the situation is still unstable, rumors are rampant, and Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners mix and there are many bandits. The defense should not be relaxed. The instructions stated: "For the matter of issuing instructions, given the current unstable situation and the lurking of bandits, although the winter defense period has ended, in order to ensure thorough security, all military and police should continue to maintain strict vigilance in accordance with the plans and procedures stipulated in the winter defense plan. They should also pay attention to reconnaissance of bandit and reactionary activities in various places, prevent and suppress them at any time, and report on the handling of these matters for verification and instruction. This is imperative."</p>
<h3>Japan's Trade Statistics with China for February</h3>
<p>Excess of Exports of 16 Million Yuan</p>
<p>2 Million Yuan Less Than Last Year</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Embassy's Commercial Affairs Office, Japan's total trade with China in February of this year was 33 million yuan, with an excess of exports of 16 million yuan. The accumulated total for this year is 17 million yuan, which is 2 million yuan less than the same period last year. This statistic shows that the import of Japanese goods is declining day by day.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Radio Station of Shanghai-Hankou Aviation Line Completed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hankou-Chengdu Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications, in order to plan the progress of the air route to Hankou within this month, has built three radio stations in Nanjing, Shanghai and Hankou to connect messages. The Shanghai radio station has been in preparation for more than a month since the Ministry commissioned Lu Jiahua to Shanghai to be in charge. The Administration, according to a letter from Station Master Zeng in Hankou, after the airport was surveyed, specially requested Lu Jun to work day and night to rush the construction, which was completed yesterday. The address of the radio station is located at the Administration on Route Lafayette.</p>
<h3>Change of Minhang Branch Bureau Chief</h3>
<p>County Public Safety Bureau Chief Shen Attended the Handover</p>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs appointed Shen Guilin, the chief of the First Branch of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, to Shanghai. After the chief of the County Public Security Bureau, Shen Jinghua, reported to the county head, he carried the salary for the second half of December of the 18th year and the first half of January of the 19th year of the branch bureau and went to Minhang in person on March 5 to supervise the handover. The former branch chief, Cheng Lin, handed over everything, and the salary was received and distributed. Shen Guilin took office immediately. Public Security Bureau Chief Shen summoned the officers and police to give a speech, saying that the police serve the party and the country and protect the local area, and they must work hard and be loyal to their duties. At present, the county's public security funds are not available, so the salary for the second half of January and the salary for the entire month of February cannot be received and released on time, which is an extremely difficult issue. The county is currently inviting local people to a meeting, and it is hoped that all officers and police will work hard to achieve results. If there are good results, they may be able to obtain local support and provide concrete measures. He then inspected the internal situation of the branch bureau and praised it highly, and gave the officers and police wine and meat as a reward.</p>
<h3>Baoshan County徵工築路</h3>
<p>Huang Xuemen, the director of the Baoshan County Construction Bureau, previously received instructions from the provincial authorities to carry out the 徵工築路 for the entire county. After receiving the order, Director Huang inspected the conditions of the cities and villages in the entire county, including the city, Luodian, Liuhang, Guangfu, Yanghang, Dachang, Yuepu, and Shengqiao. He also verified and compiled the lists of 徵工代金 and other items, and submitted them to County Head Wu Jianong for review. The engineering funds have now been calculated and construction has begun. At the same time, the situation is being reported to the provincial authorities for review.</p>
<h3>Dispute over the 加佣案 of the Yuye Dunhe Gongsuo</h3>
<p>Fish Merchants Object...Social Affairs Bureau Orders the Gongsuo to Respond</p>
<p>The practice of the Shanghai Fish Market to sell goods on behalf of customers has been to take a commission of seven cents per yuan, plus dock labor and other fees. After adding a commission of one cent in the 15th year of the Republic of China, the company this February requested the Social Affairs Bureau to add another one-cent commission to make up for the losses of previous years. The Social Affairs Bureau retrieved the expenditure accounts of the company to investigate the matter. It was later found that the company had lost about 20,000 yuan in the 18th year, so it was approved. It was also ordered to withdraw two li from the increased commission and deposit it in a special account for the construction of docks and cold storage, and to pay for the public welfare and charitable undertakings of the fishermen. Recently, it was heard that the fish merchants were unable to bear the burden and filed a petition with the Social Affairs Bureau, asking for the cancellation of the commission increase and requesting an investigation of the Dunhe Gongsuo's accounts over the years. The Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the Gongsuo to provide a clear response within a time limit for further verification.</p>
<h3>What We Heard After the Election of Foreign Directors of the 工部局</h3>
<p>British and American Concessions – The Question</p>
<p>The Reason for Arnold's Resignation</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Person Expresses Their Opinion</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported: "Since the results of this year's election of foreign directors of the 工部局 were announced, the British have taken six seats, while the Americans have only taken one. It has been said that one of the newly elected British directors will resign to allow the next-highest American to fill the seat. However, according to someone who knows the 工部局 well, this matter, if it can benefit the public on the British side, at least one person will be willing to resign voluntarily to give way to the American. However, whether this can become a reality is still difficult to say. It is also said that it has not yet been formally discussed at the board meeting." A certain important American figure stated that this proposal is indeed in the spirit of sportsmanship on the British side, and it is admirable to give way. However, for the Americans, accepting this proposal would inevitably mean losing the spirit of sportsmanship. The reason why only one American was elected this time is because there were three candidates, and the votes were split, resulting in two people not being elected. According to a certain gentleman of the 工部局, within this year, perhaps one of the British directors will resign for some reason, and at that time, an American will likely fill the vacancy.</p>
<p>After the British Arnold resigned as Director-General, he sent a letter to various Western newspapers yesterday, stating the reasons for his defeat and resignation, stating: "As Director-General, he was unable to fully agree to the Japanese's increased requests for Japanese police and other matters. Therefore, in the days before the election, he knew that he could only get 200 votes out of the 600 Japanese voters. If the election results were as expected, the Westerners would have cast more than 510 votes for him. He heard that 90% of the Japanese voters went to the polls, while only 50% of the British did. If the British expatriates continue to abandon their right to vote, the election of foreign directors will be dominated by the Japanese expatriates. However, since many new figures have been elected this time, perhaps the citizens will pay more attention to municipal affairs than before. During his tenure, he improved the municipal hospital and nursing system, improved the living conditions of Chinese and Western police, thoroughly reformed the Chinese Education Department, began to eliminate the old and promote the younger members of the 工部局 staff, gradually increased the employment of Chinese staff, and organized a salary committee to consider salary issues. In addition, he organized a bureau member association to coordinate the relationship between the board of directors and the bureau members, and improved the entire education system to give Chinese and foreign children equal opportunities. He strongly advocated hiring experts to investigate telephones and firmly rejected the request of the China &amp; Foreign Telephone Company to accept the contract of the American capital group, asking them to openly bid. In addition, such matters as harmonizing Chinese-foreign relations, sending Fei Xin悙 to Nanjing to attend the Pacific Conference, and hiring Gu Fei Tang as a consultant are all major achievements of the past year. Since the voters do not approve of this policy, it will be difficult for the board of directors if he continues to guide the formulation of the new policy for this year in the coming weeks. Therefore, he is resigning early."</p>
<p>A Wenhui Bao reporter met with a certain respected Japanese taxpayer in this port and asked about Arnold's letter published in various Western newspapers. The Japanese person denied the claim that the Japanese expatriates had assigned votes before the election and said, "Since Mr. Arnold's political views were not satisfactory to the Japanese expatriates, why would they give him 200 votes? Moreover, the Japanese would never be so foolish as to foreshadow his rejection of someone he was dissatisfied with. Moreover, the increase of Japanese police is a trivial matter. If it is said that this affected the election, isn't that a joke? It is heard that the proposal to increase Japanese police did not come from the Japanese directors. The increased Japanese police have already been transported from Japan as originally planned." The Japanese person also criticized some newspapers for advocating that a British director give up a seat so that a certain American who was not elected could fill the vacancy, saying that this move was enough to cause sadness.</p>
<h3>The Chairman of the Already-Closed Minsheng Factory Workers' Committee Absconds with Union Funds and Seals</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Sends a Letter to the Public Safety Bureau for Strict Arrest</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau is quite serious about handling union registration and issuing licenses and seals. If a factory affiliated with a union closes down, the union must be dissolved at the same time, and its license and seal must be revoked to prevent abuses. It is now heard that the bureau has learned that Xiang Shouyin, the chairman of the Minsheng Paper Mill Workers' Union, which has already been closed down, has refused to hand over the license and seal and has absconded with union funds. It has sent a letter to the Public Safety Bureau for strict arrest and has issued a notice to the industrial and commercial sectors to pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>The Pharmaceutical Industry Association Discusses a Letter from the Union</h3>
<p>The preparatory committee of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association received a letter from the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union of this city yesterday, stating: "To Whom It May Concern: The problem of unemployment placement has been discussed repeatedly at the union. Everyone believes that your association cannot take definite responsibility, which has been delayed until today. The level agencies have repeatedly convened meetings between labor and management, but your association has been absent, which is not our fault. Now, according to the resolution of the members' congress, the unemployment suffering is extremely great, and the placement cannot be delayed any longer. We hereby set a deadline of three days (before the 9th) for your association to give a definite reply. Otherwise, your members will be fully responsible for any matters that may arise in the future. This is a preliminary statement," etc. The association stated that the unemployment problem in the pharmaceutical industry had previously been approved by the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, and the Social Affairs Bureau separately, and the association was instructed to transfer to the pharmaceutical capital to prioritize the employment of the unemployed workers when hiring new workers to resolve the issue. The association had also transferred the order to the capital to comply. It could have been peaceful, but suddenly this letter from the union was received, so a meeting was convened immediately to submit the union's letter to the party and government agencies for handling.</p>
<h3>Qinglan Dyeing Industry Opens Cloth Issue</h3>
<p>Approving the Cloth Industry's Request to Postpone the Opening</p>
<p>For the 青藍 cloth pieces dyed by various cloth shops in this city, some cloth shops ask the dyeing factory workers to open the original package of cloth on their behalf. As a result, the dyeing workers do not return to the factory until late for dinner every day. After discussion at the meeting of representatives of the industry's union, it was announced to the cloth shops that from this festival onwards, all dyeing workers will no longer represent the cloth shops in "opening the market," "nailing the surface," and "printing." The Cloth Industry Association held a meeting on this matter. Everyone agreed that the time was tight and there was not enough time to prepare. A public letter was sent to the 青藍工會, requesting a compromise. The union convened a meeting yesterday morning to make a public decision. Considering the past relationship between the dyeing workers and the cloth shops, the case of not opening the cloth on behalf of the cloth shops was approved to be postponed until March 12th in the Gregorian calendar. A reply was immediately sent to the Cloth Industry Association, and notices were sent to various cloth shops to inform the workers to check.</p>

<h3>Police Rights in 洋棧 of Pudong Are All Recovered</h3>
<p>Taigu, Dalai, etc. Have Been Recovered in Order</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Agreed on a Phased Recovery Method</p>
<p>Zhang Mingqin, the third district chief of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, previously reported to Director Yuan that the foreign merchants and factories in the Pudong Yanpu area hired patrolmen or Indian police, which hindered police rights. Moreover, when a labor dispute occurred in a certain factory last year, the doorman Indian police arbitrarily shot and injured a worker. Therefore, he repeatedly requested Director Yuan to seriously negotiate and strive to recover the police rights of all factories and stacks in order to unify the system. In addition to the police rights of the important Taigu, Dalai, Osaka, Anli, Longmao, Asia, and other foreign stacks, which have been recovered in order, it is now learned that the authorities of the British-American Tobacco Company in Lujiazui have also respected our country's orders and agreed on a phased recovery method, successively transferring the original patrolmen and replacing them with petition police to protect the factory. The details are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Details of the Negotiation Process</p>
<p>The British-American Tobacco Company has two factories and one stack, covering a wide area. It employs a total of 64 Chinese patrolmen, which is the largest number of patrolmen employed in the Yanpu area. They are stationed in the stack to guard it, and they have also hired Jie Enjie, the former director of the third police station of Songhu, as the chief manager, who is not under the command of the local police station. After District Chief Zhang of the third district verified the situation, he reported it to the headquarters and personally negotiated with Landuo (transliteration), the general manager of the company, and the British-American Trade Union provided assistance. Due to other waves, it was delayed and not resolved. District Chief Zhang believed that the recovery of police rights was an important matter and could not be allowed to be rejected by foreigners. Therefore, on the 28th of last month, he re-entered the factory to negotiate and repeatedly explained the significance of transferring patrolmen to petition police. After long negotiations, the manager finally agreed to return the police rights to our country and agreed on a phased recovery method to implement it in order. The company refused to allow our country to recover police rights, which has been brewing for a long time, and has only now come to an end.</p>
<h3>Phased Recovery Method</h3>
<p>District Chief Zhang and the Company</p>
<p>The authorities agreed on a phased recovery method for police rights, which is divided into three phases: the first phase is on the 16th of this month, first transferring all patrolmen in the stack to the district and assigning strong officers and police from the district to protect the stack; the second phase is on April 1st, transferring the patrolmen of the old factory and replacing them with police; the third phase is on April 16th, transferring the patrolmen of the new factory and replacing them with police. After the patrolmen of these three places are replaced by police, the police assigned will be handled in accordance with the temporary regulations for petition police of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. As for the original patrolmen, there were two people in one post. Now, one person will be added to make three police officers in one post. The time was originally six hours on duty and six hours off. It is also changed to three hours on duty and six hours off. The police will be divided into three shifts. If Class A is on duty, Class B will rest, and both shifts will be trained. This will be cycled to balance work and rest.</p>
<h3>The Chief Officer Has Been Appointed</h3>
<p>The company's original patrolman director, Jie Enjie, was appointed by the Public Security Bureau as the district officer of the Third District Petition Police by Zhang, the district chief, because he had served as the local police chief for many years and was familiar with police affairs. He continued to serve in the factory and was paid according to the salary of the officials of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. An additional patrol officer was added to be responsible for internal and external affairs and all education matters. The Public Security Bureau has now appointed Cui Zhu, the household patrol officer of the district, to fill the position. It is heard that the patrol officer is a graduate of the Beiping Advanced Police Academy and has served in important positions such as the chief of the public security branch. He has considerable experience in police affairs.</p>
<h3>Additional Information After the Agreement</h3>
<p>The phased recovery of police</p>
<p>After the right method has been agreed, the company has now submitted the clothing fee for the first batch of petition police to the third district, which will be forwarded to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for storage and expedited production of uniforms. The original patrolmen were 64 in number. Now, District Chief Zhang has planned to change all of them to police according to the size of the company and increase the number by 20, for a total of 84, to strengthen the strength. As for the original patrolmen transferred back to the district, the Municipal Public Security Bureau will send personnel to test and separate them. Those who pass will be dressed in police uniforms and reorganized into police, and sent to various places to stand guard to provide training. After the district sends a large number of police to the British-American Company, in addition to using patrolmen to fill the vacancies, the shortage will be supplemented by the training institute of the Municipal Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Pay Attention to the Case of Stringing Together to Kill One's Step-Mother</h3>
<p>Continued Hearing of Zhang Wenqing's Case of Stringing Together to Kill Her Step-Mother</p>
<p>Even More Crowded Attendance at the Hearing Than Before</p>
<p>Bai Wangshi Only Knows the Slang of the Lunar Calendar</p>
<p>The Four Defendants Are Remanded for Another Hearing on the 17th</p>
<h3>Almost No Space in the Courtroom</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenqing, the eldest daughter of the late Qing official Zhang Fusheng of Huzhou, is 24 years old and unmarried. Due to a dispute over inheritance, she colluded with Chen Hengcai, Yao Yonggui, and Gao Jintang to stab her stepmother Zhang Su to death with a knife at her residence at No. 762 Carter Road at about 6 pm on January 25th of this year. At 2 pm yesterday, Judge Luo Renji, accompanied by American Observer Meng Hate, came to the First Criminal Court of the Temporary Court to continue the hearing. The men and women attending the hearing were even more crowded than before, and there was almost no space in the courtroom.</p>
<h3>Both Witnesses Arrived in Court</h3>
<p>At around 2 pm, Zhang Wenqing was brought out from the women's prison by an official matchmaker and sat next to the defendant's box, slightly lowering her head. The two lawyers representing the plaintiffs' side, the lawyers Wang Shang and Jiang Baolian representing the defendant Zhang Wenqing, and the lawyer Ru Bao representing the police all arrived on time. First, the police lawyer Ru said that the court had ordered the witnesses Bai Wangshi and Wang Qianshi to be summoned, and the police had now brought the two witnesses to court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Wang Qianshi's Testimony</h3>
<p>Wang Qianshi then testified, stating that she was from Jiangxi, 27 years old, her husband worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and she lived at No. 757 Qing'anli, Avenue Edward VII. She had been neighbors with the Zhang family for seven or eight years. Although they were acquainted on weekdays, they had no contact. At 5:30 pm on January 25th, when Zhang Su was stabbed, she did not know. It was not until around 6 pm that she heard a noise outside. She went out to investigate and saw the deceased sitting on the floor in the living room, bleeding from the head, unable to speak. Her elder wife and eldest daughter (i.e., Wenqing) were standing next to her. Later, the eldest daughter asked me to send her to the hospital. Since there was only the Red Cross Hospital on Carter Road, she and the eldest daughter went to the hospital to contact them, and then came back. The eldest daughter then sent the injured to the hospital in a car. At that time, she did not go with them. At 8 pm, she went to the hospital to visit the injured. At that time, Zhang Wenqing was not there, and the wound had been bandaged by the doctor. She only heard the injured say, "Two children." The injured's sister and her two children were also there. At this point, Judge Luo ordered the four defendants to be taken to the waiting room and ordered the deceased's brother, Su Yaoting, to leave the courtroom for separate questioning. Judge Luo asked Wang Qianshi, "Did the deceased and the elder wife have disagreements on weekdays?" She replied that she did not know. He also asked whether Zhang Wenqing had any unpleasantness with the deceased, and she replied that she did not know. He asked whether Chen Hengcai's mother, who worked for the Zhang family, was fired by the deceased. She replied that she did not know, but after the Zhang family's lawsuit was settled, she was invited to lunch. Some year before, the elder wife told her after she was sick that she had handed over the housework to the mother of the younger Mao Tou (i.e., the deceased) because she was often sick. The deceased also told her that the elder wife had twice wanted to hand over the management rights to her, etc.</p>
<h3>The Audience Laughed Loudly</h3>
<p>Witness Bai Wangshi testified that she was from Jiangbei, 20 years old, lived in Zhenjiang, and her mother's family lived in Zhabei. The deceased was her maternal aunt and she did not visit often. In November of last year, she went to the Zhang family with the deceased's aunt. Judge Luo asked, "What month did you say, November, lunar or solar?" She replied, "We Jiangbei people only know the lunar calendar and do not know the solar calendar." Those who were listening in the court suddenly laughed loudly. Judge Luo angrily announced, "There are rules for listening in the court. You cannot laugh at will. If you do so again, you will be dealt with according to the law."</p>
<h3>Denying the Phrase "Conspiracy to Murder"</h3>
<p>He then continued to question Bai Wangshi and testified that it was her first visit in November and that she went again around the 15th of December. Judge Luo asked her, "Zhang Wenqing previously testified that you went to the Zhang family in November and told her that her aunt and her aunt's brother wanted to murder Zhang. Is this true?" She replied, "This is not true." Judge Luo then ordered Zhang Wenqing to be brought to the court for confrontation. Zhang strongly stated that this was true, but Bai Wangshi firmly denied it.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Zhang Yin's Accusation</h3>
<p>Su Yaoting, the brother of the deceased, was also summoned to the court for questioning. Judge Luo asked, "In your previous statement, in addition to accusing the four defendants in this case, you also accused Zhang Wenqing's brother-in-law, Yin Rongyuan, and sister, Zhang Wenpei, but you have not provided any evidence. In the future, I am afraid that there will be no good results. Do you still accuse them?" Su replied that he would definitely accuse them. The police lawyer Ru immediately stood up and stated that the police had already accused the four defendants. Because there was no evidence against Zhang Wenpei and Yin Rongyuan, they would not be prosecuted. Now that the family of the deceased has filed a lawsuit on their own, a decision should be made first on the progress of this case and whether it should be tried together. Judge Luo reviewed the testimony and said that the family of the deceased had already filed a lawsuit and could not be forcibly stopped. However, the progress of this case and the joint trial are another matter. He hoped that the family of the deceased would withdraw the charges against Zhang Wenpei and Yin Rongyuan, and the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the lawsuit was filed according to the wishes of the parties. As for the evidence, it was unclear. They would discuss it with the parties after the adjournment to determine whether there was sufficient evidence and then make a decision.</p>
<h3>Exceedingly Elegant Clothing</h3>
<p>Furthermore, Wang Shang, the attorney representing Zhang Wenqing, interrogated Chen Hengcai, asking, "Did you ever hear the deceased plotting to harm Zhang Wenqing?" Chen replied, "At the time, I heard Miss Zhang Wenqing say that if she won the lawsuit, my life would be in danger." He was also asked, "How many days a week was the deceased at home?" He answered, "Only one or two days. The deceased's clothing when going out on weekdays was quite elegant, wearing pink silk cheongsams, etc." The lawyer also asked Zhang Wenqing about the deceased's daily conduct. Zhang replied, "Quite undisciplined, often not returning for several days." At this point in the interrogation, Judge Luo decided that the case still needed to be postponed and instructed the four defendants to be remanded in custody separately, with the retrial scheduled for the afternoon of the 17th of this month.</p>
<h3>The Dalun Company Real Estate Lawsuit Was Tried Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chinese and foreign real estate industries are paying close attention to this case.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce and the Taxpayers' Association have both sent replies.</p>
<p>The Dalun side presented a great deal of evidence.</p>
<p>The debate was declared closed and a date was set for the verdict.</p>
<p>The Dalun Real Estate Company's lawsuit, due to the refusal of tenants such as the Laoda Fang on Nanjing Road to vacate their premises, has been appealed by Laoda Fang and others, who disagree with the judgment of the Provisional Court in the first instance. They raised three "customs" regarding (1) tenants owing three months' rent, (2) landlords taking back the property for their own use, and (3) old buildings being eligible for reconstruction. The Court of Appeal requested the Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee to investigate the existence of these customs to verify the matter. The Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee has now replied to the court. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the retrial of the case. After 2:00 PM, the lawyers and parties of both sides arrived in court successively. The secretary of Mr. Feitang, the consultant to the Public Works Department, and Bo Liang, the lawyer for the police, as well as Chinese and foreign individuals involved in the real estate business, were mostly present in court to observe, given that this case has a significant impact on the future of the real estate industry. Subsequently, Chief Judge Hu, along with Judges Zhong and Zhu, ascended to the bench and had the reply from the Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee distributed to the lawyers of both sides for review. The lawyer for the tenants stood up and stated that the reply contained the phrase "in reality, there is no fixed custom," which shows that the custom is not nonexistent. Moreover, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association and the joint chambers of commerce of various roads have also sent letters proving the existence of this custom. The staff of the Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee are selected by the Chamber of Commerce Joint Association. Now, the reply from the Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee uses ambiguous wording, hastily claiming there is no fixed custom, in hopes of avoiding offending either side. The lawyer also cited a judgment in another rental case, saying that within that judgment, there was also the statement that "even if the property is not taken back for own use, the original tenant still has the right to rent." Renting from Chinese landlords is different from renting from Westerners. When renting from Westerners, there is no need for excavation fees or small rents, while renting from Chinese landlords requires such fees, and so on. Following this, Shi Ying, the lawyer representing Dalun, elaborated in detail on the necessary conditions for the establishment of a custom, listing five points and presenting a great deal of evidence, all of which were procedures used by landlords in the concession for notifying old tenants to vacate when reconstructing new buildings for rent. These were proven by letters from the respective landlords, totaling no fewer than twenty or so, stating that the reasons for those landlords to ask their tenants to move out were mostly similar to the present case, such as the houses not being taken back for own use, nor being old and reconstructed, and there being no so-called right of the old tenants to have priority in renting the new building, etc., and those tenants did not make claims like the tenants in this case. Even the construction of the Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun department stores in the past limited tenants to vacating within one month, and the tenants had no objections. Also, Shanghai Bank recently rented land from the Guangzhao Guild Hall to build a house, and its old tenants were all required to vacate within two months. This court was reorganized from the former public office, and the former public office judged a great many rental disputes, but there was no precedent for this custom. Recently, the Yan Maoyuan Hotel was also involved in a property lawsuit, and the result was also a judgment that the tenant vacate, with the judgment containing the statement that "according to a lease contract without a fixed term, the parties can request to terminate the contract at any time." It can be seen that if the tenant does not vacate, there should be a contract, and empty claims cannot be made. Lawyer Qin Liankui, also representing Dalun, argued that what is being disputed now is the issue of custom, and as a result of the investigation by the Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee, it was said that there is no fixed custom. No fixed custom naturally means that there is no such custom, and it is definitely not an ambiguous statement. Recently, the appellant's lawyer said that the staff of the Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee were appointed by the Chamber of Commerce Joint Association, which is also a misunderstanding. The current Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee is appointed by government order to engage in the reorganization of merchant organizations, equivalent to the General Chamber of Commerce of the past, and its position has nothing to do with the Chamber of Commerce Joint Association or the Taxpayers' Association. The reply from the Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee says that there is no such custom, and the only custom claimed by the appellant has no concrete proof, so there is no need for much debate. Another lawyer for the appellant elaborated on the theoretical aspect of the establishment of a custom, then criticized the ambiguity of the reply from the Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee, and then claimed to have investigated and obtained evidence regarding rental disputes from the local court and the municipal government, one being a letter from the county chamber of commerce replying to the local court, and the other being rental rules set by the municipal government, and immediately presented the two items of evidence. The lawyer for Dalun immediately stated that the rules set by the municipal government have not been approved by the central government, so they have not yet taken effect, and attention should be paid to this. After a long debate between the two sides, Chief Judge Hu declared the debate in this case closed and set the date for the verdict at 3:00 PM on the [day missing from original].</p>
<h3>Sixty Thousand Dollars in Brand-New Silver Dollars Suddenly Lost in Two Bundles</h3>
<p>The dismissed porter displays great skill.</p>
<p>He pried open the silver box and stole two bundles.</p>
<p>He lost two hundred silver dollars gambling in four rounds.</p>
<p>Easy come, easy go.</p>
<p>The Su Hengmao Automobile Freight Company at 214 Boundary Road has been in operation for many years, acting as an agent for various banks, including the Chinese, Communications, and Central Banks in Shanghai, transporting silver for more than ten years. In particular, it has transported newly minted national currency for the Central Bank between Shanghai and Hangzhou in large quantities. Every morning, silver bars are transported from Shanghai to the Hangzhou Mint to be minted into dollars, and in the afternoon, silver dollars are transported back to Shanghai and sent to the Central Bank, which is a common practice. At 12:40 PM yesterday, when the Hangzhou express train arrived in Shanghai, it was also loaded with 60,000 silver dollars, divided into twelve boxes, each containing 5,000 dollars. Each box was sealed on the outside, and the silver dollars inside were further divided into fifty bundles, each containing 100 dollars. After arriving at the station, they were unloaded from the train and temporarily stacked on the platform, then transported out of the station using handcarts, with six boxes per batch. When the porters returned to the platform after loading the first batch of six boxes onto the truck, they suddenly saw that the seal on the top box was broken and the box lid was open, which greatly shocked them. They immediately reported to the company owner, Su Jind, who arrived at the scene. After inspecting the situation, it was discovered that two bundles of silver dollars, totaling 200 dollars, were missing. They immediately inquired whether there were any idlers mixed in while transporting the silver boxes. After some thought, the porters recalled that Xu Yuanshan, a Jiangbei native nicknamed "Little Jiangbei," who had previously worked for the company but had since been dismissed, had been present at the scene. Because they were mostly familiar with him, they did not pay much attention at the time. But when they recalled his lingering near the boxes, it seemed suspicious. Therefore, they reported the information to the Public Concession's Haining Road Police Station and requested them to apprehend him. At the same time, Su Jind hired a car and rushed to Xu Yuanshuang's cake shop at 69 Huaji Road, which was opened by Xu Yuanshan's brother, to investigate. Both Xu's were there. The two brothers were celebrating their windfall, which they could use to gamble for good luck this year. The arrival of the detectives was like a sudden disaster. After the joy, they felt frustrated. According to Xu Yuanshan's confession, he exchanged all of the original 200 dollars for banknotes because he thought it was too heavy to carry. Of those, four dollars had already been lost gambling in a mahjong game on Zhongxing Road. Therefore, the actual amount remaining was 196 silver dollars. Xu Yuanshan and Xu Yuanshuang were both escorted to the police station. The fifth district of the Zhabei Public Security Bureau sent</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>police to bring them back. The defendant confessed to the theft without denying it. Xu Yuanshan confessed that he was 29 years old, from Yangzhou, and had previously worked as a porter at the Su Hengmao Freight Company, but was dismissed for improper behavior and became unemployed. When he pried open the box and committed the theft, it only took five or six minutes. Two hundred brand-new silver dollars were easily obtained, which could be said to be the work of an expert. However, from the time he exchanged the money, lost it gambling, was discovered, and was arrested, it was also only five or six hours, which was also very fast.</p>
<h3>A Farmer's Wife Pregnant for Four Months Gives Birth to a Fleshly Egg</h3>
<p>The egg contained only a bag of fresh blood.</p>
<p>The family considered it an ominous sign.</p>
<p>Zhang Dada, a resident of the Chongbao Sand area on the border of Baoshan and Chongming counties outside Wusongkou, and his wife, Zhou, who is 34 years old, have been married for over a decade but have not had any children. Zhou is quite virtuous and has repeatedly encouraged her husband to take a concubine to continue the family line, but Zhang has refused because Zhou is not yet old. Unexpectedly, around November of last year, Zhou's menstrual cycle suddenly stopped, which greatly pleased the entire family. Zhou's abdomen grew larger day by day, growing unusually quickly. By the end of last month, only four months had passed, but her abdomen was bulging as if she were ten months pregnant. The family was suspicious and thought that Zhou must be suffering from bloating, so they consulted many doctors for treatment. However, after being diagnosed by general practitioners, they all said that Zhou was indeed pregnant and not ill. Zhang's whole family began to feel at ease, but they were still half-believing and half-doubting. Then, at around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, Zhou suddenly felt abdominal pain and told her family. Everyone thought that she was only four months pregnant and had not yet reached the time of delivery, so they paid no attention. But at around 2:00 PM, Zhou's abdominal pain became more severe, and in a few minutes, she gave birth to a purple fleshy egg about a foot in diameter, shaped like a soccer ball. The whole family was shocked and the news quickly spread far and wide, with everyone rushing to see it and calling it a strange event. Later, someone claimed that it was probably a wrapped birth, and that if the outer skin of the fleshy egg were cut open, the baby inside could survive. Zhang was afraid of this saying, so he carefully dissected the fleshy egg with a kitchen knife, only to find that the egg contained only a bag of fresh blood and a white, protein-like mucous. In addition to their disappointment, Zhang's family thought it was an ominous sign and immediately threw it into the cesspool. Zhou's spirits were still good after giving birth. This matter is quite unusual and is truly worthy of physiological research.</p>
<h3>Children Are Unaware of the Dangers of the Urban Tiger</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Reiterates the Prohibition</p>
<p>Instruction: The Municipal Public Security Bureau issued an instruction to all district offices yesterday, stating, "For the purpose of issuing an order, we recently received a letter from Councilor Tang of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government stating that he has witnessed ignorant children playing in the roads every day on his way to Zhabei, rushing back and forth, and even deliberately blocking the way of oncoming cars. If the drivers are not careful, or if the stop is a little late, it can easily cause accidents. If these naughty children are not curbed, it is feared that the number of vehicle-related injuries will inevitably increase day by day. He instructed us to draft measures to curb this phenomenon in order to remedy the situation, etc. In view of this, it has been found that children rushing back and forth on the road can easily cause accidents with passing vehicles if drivers are not careful. A strict prohibition was announced in June of last year, and in December, an order was issued to all district offices to thoroughly investigate and prohibit such behavior. Now, in view of the aforementioned reasons, such incidents still occur in the Zhabei area, and the remaining district offices are likely to be no exception. Although this is due to the people neglecting the prohibition over time, it is also due to the failure of the relevant district offices to implement it effectively. The police have the responsibility of managing traffic and preventing harm, and they should urgently reiterate the previous order and strictly curb such behavior. Subsequently, the heads of the respective district offices should supervise the police officers at all times during their duty or patrols and pay special attention. If they encounter young children deliberately playing and rushing onto the road when cars are approaching, they should still follow the previous order, immediately detain them, summon their parents, order them to discipline their children, and issue a warning. If they re-offend, they will be punished according to the provisions of Article 8, Section 2, Article 42, Section 9 of the Regulations on Punishment of Violations of Police Regulations, and after the immediate decision, the reasons for the punishment will be posted in a concise notice in the area to inform the public and serve as a warning to others. In addition to attaching the announcement prohibiting the behavior and distributing it, the district office director is hereby ordered to promptly comply with and handle this matter, and to post the announcement in appropriate thoroughfares. The locations of the postings should be reported for record. This order."</p>
<p>Announcement: The Municipal Public Security Bureau announces that, considering the heavy traffic and the fast speed of cars, which makes it difficult to stop suddenly, ignorant children often play in the road, and even rush directly at oncoming cars, or even deliberately block the way, which is extremely dangerous. A strict prohibition has already been announced, but people inevitably neglect it over time. Therefore, this is a reiteration of the warning, and the responsibility for discipline lies with the fathers and brothers. If anyone dares to violate the prohibition, they will be punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Public Bus Longhua Line</h3>
<p>Adding special buses is pre-announced.</p>
<p>It is customary in this city that during the spring season, merchants and ladies often make appointments to visit Longhua together. The second route of the Shanghai South Public Bus Company's business is at its best during this time of year. The company is now planning to add four to six special buses, converted from the third route circular line buses and designated reserve vehicles that are ready for use, as the existing eight buses are insufficient to meet the demand. These special buses will run from Laoximen, through Xieqiao and Xieshi Road, directly to Longhua, and the fare will be 45 copper coins, which is slightly higher than the regular ticket price, in order to limit ordinary passengers. After the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities submitted the report, it considered that this transfer of buses was aimed at meeting transportation needs and was feasible. However, it instructed that the words "Longhua Special Bus, no stops along the way except for Xieqiao" must be displayed on the outside of the bus and at each stop to avoid disputes caused by short-distance passengers misunderstanding. Also, if the third route circular line is approved for operation, then those buses will still be transferred back to the third route. It is said that the period of operation for these special buses is one month, but the company has not yet set the start and end dates, so the Bureau of Public Utilities has instructed it to submit a supplementary report for record.</p>
<h3>Provisional Court Judge Will Inspect the "Fearless" Film</h3>
<p>After the screening of the "Fearless" talkie starring Locke at the Da Guangming Cinema, it aroused indignation among the Chinese people, who expressed their opinions and requested the municipal party headquarters to ban it, as has been reported in the newspapers repeatedly. Now, Mr. Hong Shen has formally filed a lawsuit against the Cantonese manager of the cinema, and the Provisional Court, which is handling the case, believes that it is necessary to inspect the "Fearless" film that caused the dispute. It is said that the judge in charge plans to go to the Da Guangming Cinema next Sunday to have the film screened in order to see the whole picture and understand the content. Therefore, Hong Shen's lawsuit must wait until the film has been inspected by the judge before a date for the trial can be set.</p>
<h3>Xinzhuang Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Will Install Electric Lights</h3>
<p>Xinzhuang Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is a transportation hub for major towns such as Sijing, so the passenger traffic on each train is extremely crowded. When passengers get on and off the night express train, the platform is dark due to the lack of electric lights, and many people have fallen into the tracks as a result. There have been complaints from the public. The stationmasters of the station, Huang Xun and Fang Yangzhi, aware of this situation, submitted a request to the traffic department to install electric lights, which has been approved, and workers will be dispatched to install them soon.</p>
<h3>Continued Report on Ding Runxiang Being Beaten by a Russian</h3>
<p>The Medical Examiner's Certificate of Injury</p>
<p>Ding Files a Complaint with the Court</p>
<p>The incident in which Ding Runxiang, the owner of the Paris Cinema on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, was beaten and injured by Keremiruf, a Russian civil servant sent by the Procuratorate of the French Concession Mixed Court, on February 27th of last month (February), has already been reported in this newspaper on the 3rd of this month. Now there is a medical examiner's certificate of injury and the original text of Ding Runxiang's complaint to the French Court, which are recorded below.</p>
<p>Translation of the Certificate of Injury: I, Lang Pei, Medical Officer and Doctor of Medicine from the University of Paris, hereby certify that I examined Mr. Ding Runxiang on February 27, 1930, and found the following injuries: (1) The left eye and lower eyelid are abnormally swollen, with two wounds, one about two centimeters long and the other a straight line, penetrating deep inside the corner of the eye. The two wounds were caused by excessive bleeding and were sewn up by ophthalmologist Yakes. However, according to Yakes' diagnosis, after this eye injury, it is feared that its original function cannot be guaranteed. (2) There is a wound on the lower lip, with a lot of bleeding, and the upper teeth are also injured and swollen. (3) There are many injuries all over the body, especially on the right flank, right elbow, and chest. (4) The injured person vomited blood after being injured, which was very dangerous. Under examination of the lungs, old wounds were clearly seen to have recurred as a result. The above-mentioned injuries were all caused by being assaulted. Signed, Police Officer Ming Pei'an, February 27, 1930.</p>
<p>Original Text of the Complaint: Complainant: Ding Runxiang; Defendant: Keremiruf; Subject: Drunk Assault Causing Injury, Requesting Legal Action and Reserving the Right to Claim Damages. The complainant, Ding Runxiang, was injured in an unprovoked drunk assault by Keremiruf, a bailiff of the French Court, on the 27th of this month. The circumstances of the incident at the time are described as follows: At 11:30 AM that morning, the defendant went to the Paris Cinema to deliver a pre-trial attachment order to the manager, Han Binyi, in a case where Baukes accused the complainant of damage compensation. At that time, Han Binyi was not in the cinema, so the cinema staff led the defendant to a nearby shop to meet Han Binyi. Han received and read the ruling, and said that he had never known about the content of the case, so he wanted to ask Ding Runxiang. He and the defendant Keremiruf returned to the cinema to the room where the complainant lived on the roof garden, told Keremiruf to wait outside, and knocked on the door, preparing to enter the room alone. Unexpectedly, Keremiruf followed him in. At that time, the complainant had not yet gotten out of bed. When he saw Han and others, he got up in his underwear to meet them. Keremiruf explained his purpose, and the complainant asked him to contact his agent, Lawyer Tickbeck. Unexpectedly, Keremiruf raised his fist and punched him. In order to defend himself, the complainant had no choice but to resist. However, Keremiruf was strong and fierce, and dragged the complainant to the cement floor on the roof, where he punched and kicked him. The complainant was covered in injuries, and his right eye was particularly badly injured. Han Binyi was on the scene at the time and wanted to step forward to mediate, but he was also pushed away by Keremiruf. Unable to do anything else, he tried his best to call for help. Fortunately, the cinema staff heard the noise and gathered together, and finally rescued the complainant, while Keremiruf still intended to escape. The three Chinese police officers who arrived at the scene held him down and investigated everything. At first, they planned to arrest Keremiruf, but the Western police officers who arrived at the scene recognized him as a bailiff of the court, so they allowed him to turn himself in to the police station. The complainant's left eye had been injured and was bulging outwards. His family sent him to Pushi Road Hospital, where he was examined by Dr. Lang Pei'an and ophthalmologist Wukesen, but they could not guarantee that the original function of his left eye would be restored. The defendant's intentional injury, regardless of his status, is not permitted by law and should be held criminally responsible without a doubt. Therefore, I hereby file a complaint, requesting that the defendant be ordered to appear in court and be punished for the crime he deserves, and that the plaintiff be allowed to bring a private prosecution, ordering Keremiruf to compensate for all damages caused by the injury, the amount of which will be determined after an assessment. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai French Concession Mixed Court.</p>
<h3>The Manager of Guangrentang Pharmacy Turns Himself In and Admits to Arson</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Seven Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>The Guangrentang Pharmacy at No. 2025 Avenue Haig (Avenue d'Eivry) suddenly caught fire at 7:00 PM on December 30th of last year. After the fire brigade extinguished the fire, the police in charge discovered that the pharmacy was involved in insurance fraud. While investigating, Zheng Zhaoxiang, a 60</p>
<p>one-year-old Anhui native, turned himself in to the police, admitting that he was the manager of the pharmacy. Zheng was then sent to the Provisional Court, where he was interrogated repeatedly. He was found to have committed arson. Yesterday morning, Judge Luo opened the court and pronounced the verdict, sentencing Zheng Zhaoxiang to seven years of imprisonment. The number of days spent in detention before the verdict was allowed to be counted as two days for one day.</p>
<h3>The Heavenly Incense Ceremony at Longhua</h3>
<p>Writing petitions from door to door amounts to thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>A tall wooden frame is built to burn the petitions.</p>
<p>The police bureau bans it as it involves superstition.</p>
<p>Li Bingzhi, 45 years old, from Xiangxiang, Hunan, established the Hua Moral Society and the Haohua Cunchantang in a house at No. 2371 Maogong Bridge, Longhua Road, two years ago. He colluded with the local blind man Cheng Chongguang as a partner and conspired with local ruffians such as Tang to solicit petitions from door to door, amounting to thousands of dollars. Recently, he came up with a bizarre idea. The day before yesterday, he hired workers to build a wooden frame 36 feet tall on an open space in Jijiawan, poured it with kerosene, placed a pot of sandalwood on top, and piled up tree branches and ignition materials below. Then, he burned a paper with the names of the donors on the sandalwood. The fire burned from top to bottom for a Heavenly Incense Ceremony. At the time, smoke filled the sky and flames soared. It was said that it could eliminate disasters and bring blessings, and bring peace to the whole area. Hundreds of ignorant villagers went to worship, and passersby flocked to Longhua Road to watch. The incident was learned by Zheng Pengfei, a patrolman from the Longhua Town Public Security Bureau's branch office, who considered that this kind of action was a form of superstition, and was deeply afraid that it would spread to houses, and that the large number of people would cause chaos and affect public safety. So, he personally led several police officers to disperse the crowd, and made every effort to extinguish the fire and demolish the wooden frame. Li Bingzhi, Dan Shichang, and two other people, who were the ringleaders, were taken back to the station. After a brief interrogation, he thought that these people were spreading rumors to confuse the public and using it as a pretext to collect money, so he immediately prepared a document and sent them to the Sixth District, Third Precinct for handling.</p>
<h3>Huashang and Zhabei Two Electrical Companies</h3>
<p>Change the Electricity Supply Areas of Fahua and Pusong</p>
<p>The three districts of Fahua, Caoging, and Pusong in this city were not originally within the operating area of any electrical company. In order to implement the policy of universal electricity supply, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities had submitted requests to the Municipal Government in May and June of the 18th year and obtained approval to temporarily assign the entire territory of the three districts to the Huashang and Zhabei two electrical companies for electricity supply, respectively. After the plan was finalized, the area around Xujiahui Catholic Church, which had been supplied with electricity by the French Concession, was officially taken back and supplied by the Huashang Electrical Company. The electricity use in Fahua Town is also being planned for distribution by the company. As for the Pusong district, the Beixinjing Town was also electrified by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company at the end of January of this year. In the future, the electricity supply in the three districts will meet the needs and will expand more and more widely. It can be said with certainty that, in terms of location, Caoging District is located in the southeast, close to the operating area of the Huashang Electrical Company, so it is appropriate to assign it to Huashang. However, Fahua and Pusong districts, one in the east and one in the west, at that time, the bureau aimed to make the operating area consistent with the administrative area for easy supervision, so it assigned Fahua to Huashang and Pusong to Zhabei. This division method can be called the east-west division method. However, according to the inherent operating areas of the Huashang and Zhabei companies, one is in the south and one is in the north, and the Fahua and Pusong districts are located in between. The southern part is close to Huashang, and the northern part along the south bank of the Suzhou River is close to Zhabei. If we do not adhere to the administrative area, but consider the convenience of connecting wires and supplying electricity, then it is appropriate to assign the northern part of the two districts to Zhabei and the southern part to Huashang. Moreover, within the two districts, the roads built by the Public Concession across the border are crisscrossed. If Huashang wants to pass through these roads to supply electricity to the northern part of Fahua District, and Zhabei wants to pass through these roads to supply electricity to the southern part of Pusong District, in fact, there will be many disputes, and the equipment will not be economical. In view of this, the bureau also found that there is Daxilu in Fahua District and Hongqiao Road in Pusong District, both of which run from east to west, right in the middle of the north and south. Therefore, it suggested to the Municipal Government to change to the north-south division method, using Daxilu and Hongqiao Road as the boundary, dividing the Fahua and Pusong districts into northern and southern parts. The southern part is assigned to Huashang, and the northern part is assigned to Zhabei. In this way, the operating scope of both parties will not be greatly affected, and the connection and electricity supply will be much more convenient. It will also have no impact on the current electricity supply situation of the two companies in the two districts. It is said that the Municipal Government considers this method of changing the electricity supply area feasible and has instructed that it be approved.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Foreign Silver Import Tax Is Undecided</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of soaring gold prices and plummeting silver prices, the National Government authorities have had various plans, among which the two most prevalent are the prohibition of foreign silver imports and the imposition of heavy taxes on foreign silver imports. In recent days, various markets have been rumored that the National Government will implement a plan to impose heavy taxes on foreign silver imports, and that it will be implemented starting next week. According to investigations from various sources, the National Government has not yet decided on a solution to the above plan. It is currently being jointly reviewed by Minister Kong of Industry and Commerce and Minister Song of Finance. How it will be expressed, there is no decision yet. External rumors are all speculations by speculators, and the National Government will have a formal order announced.</p>
<h3>Customs Brokerage Industry Requests Reduced Water Freight Charges Again</h3>
<p>The Shanghai North and South City Customs Brokerage Association sent letters yesterday to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Taikoo Dockyard, Ning Shao Steamship Company, and Sanpei Shipping Company, stating: "We are writing to you because we received a letter from the Ningbo Anlan Association, and we were also informed by dozens of North and South Goods and Sugar businesses that the cost of some of these goods is relatively low, and they cannot afford to increase the water freight charges. Otherwise, they will be forced to use other transportation routes. Therefore, they entrusted our association to negotiate with your four companies to modify the water freight charges so that both parties can benefit."</p>
<p>"We commissioned Committee Member Zhou Jingzhai to investigate whether this was true. Now, according to Committee Member Zhou's reply, there are fifty or sixty types of sugar, North and South goods, all of which are food products and cannot be compared to luxury goods. For those with higher costs, the stipulated water freight charges are still manageable. However, there are eight types of goods with very low costs: rock sugar, melon seeds, jujubes, bean starch noodles, peanuts, walnuts, raw kernels, and sesame seeds. Each load only costs between ten and eight taels of silver, and it is difficult to sustain with the increased water freight charges. It will inevitably lead to the cessation of transportation by steamships and a switch to sailboats. This will result in losses for both the transportation company and the North and South goods businesses."</p>
<p>"This matter concerns the interests of all three parties. We urge your company to consider improvements so that business can be sustained for a long time. We hope you will carefully consider this matter. We are writing to inform you accordingly, and we hope you will investigate and take appropriate action."</p>
<h3>Meeting Report of the Chinese Child Welfare Association</h3>
<p>The Children's Research Department Actively Implements the Original Plan: The Shanghai Chinese Child Welfare Association has drafted a child protection law. However, it is necessary to further study how to protect children. Therefore, the Children's Research Department Committee of the association convened a meeting at the association's headquarters the other day.

<h3>Divorce Case Settled in Court</h3>
<p>Mrs. Xu Gu, 26 years old, a native of Shanghai, residing in Lujiawan, married Xu Sifu, a carpenter from Nan Shoumu Bridge in Yinxianggang, at the age of 20. After the marriage, the couple was not harmonious and she was not favored by her mother-in-law. Therefore, she had to live temporarily at her mother's house, while Xu went to other places to do business. This situation has lasted for seven years. At the end of last year in the lunar calendar, the case was once involved in a police station dispute. Now, Mrs. Xu Gu has hired a lawyer to file a divorce lawsuit with the District Court, stating briefly: "The plaintiff used to work in a yarn factory and married the defendant on March 24th of the Republic of China's 13th year. At that time, I only knew that the defendant was a carpenter who could support himself. But after the marriage, the defendant did not engage in production, and his mother was especially violent. Every time the factory paid wages, she would ask the plaintiff for her wages. If she was not satisfied, the mother and son would unite and either beat or scold her. The plaintiff could not bear the suffering and had to live temporarily at her mother's house, while the defendant would come to harass her from time to time. He even injured the plaintiff's mother. Later, the plaintiff was persuaded to return to the defendant's house, but the defendant and his mother continued to mistreat her, even detaining the plaintiff's clothes. The plaintiff had to return to her mother's house. These events all happened in the 13th year. In June of last year, the plaintiff's mother passed away. In August, the plaintiff's second sister, Zhou Gu, came and claimed that the defendant was demanding a divorce from the plaintiff, asking for 200 yuan in compensation. The plaintiff refused his request. On December 28th, the second sister came with detectives and claimed that the defendant had accused the plaintiff of embezzlement at the 2nd District Branch. She was ordered to be arrested and taken to the branch, then transferred to the 2nd District for detention. Her eldest sister, Sun Gu, bailed her out. On February 13th of the solar calendar, detectives suddenly came again and arrested the eldest sister, Sun Gu, for detention, but she was later released. The plaintiff only seeks to escape the entanglement and does not want to create further complications. Therefore, she requests unconditional divorce."</p>
<p>The defendant also hired lawyer Hu Yuanjun to file a defense and counterclaim, requesting cohabitation, briefly stating: "After marrying the plaintiff, the relationship was initially harmonious. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff was unfaithful and incited by her sister, Sun Gu. On December 23rd of the 13th year, she fled without a trace and could not be found after repeated searches. It was not until last year that her address was discovered, and the police were informed to arrest her. Soon after, her sister bailed her out, stating that Gu would return home. On January 9th, she went to the station to inquire, and the district informed her of the bail situation, so Sun Gu was again detained. Now, Xu Gu, deceived by Sun Gu, has filed a lawsuit requesting divorce. The defendant strongly opposes it and requests cohabitation."</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang opened the court for trial. Both parties arrived in court with their lawyers and successively stated the previous events. The plaintiff insisted on divorce, while the defendant requested cohabitation. The judge repeatedly advised the plaintiff and instructed the defendant not to mistreat her. The plaintiff said, "They want to chain me up." The judge said, "If they chain you, you are allowed to come and report it." Thus, a settlement was reached. The plaintiff voluntarily agreed to wait two more days, and the defendant would go to pick her up and reunite. Both parties signed the agreement and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Guard Against a Wife</h3>
<p>Enticed Away by a Fellow Villager in Hankou</p>
<p>Intercepted by Detectives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Ms. Xu Xinbao, 21 years old, from Zhoupu, Pudong, was betrothed to Yao Yuping, a fellow villager. Yao, 24 years old this year, works in Wu Guisheng's leather suitcase shop on Houchang Road in Hankou. After Yao returned to his hometown to marry her the year before last, the newlyweds only enjoyed ten days before he was forced to leave his hometown due to livelihood concerns. Fearing that his young and beautiful wife would be alone and vulnerable to improper incidents, he disregarded the high cost of living in the city and brought his beloved wife to Hankou to live together so that they could see each other day and night and be easily supervised. However, things did not go as planned. In December of last year, Qian Ruixiang, 25 years old, also from Pudong, worked as a carpenter for foreigners in Hankou. He knew both Yao and Xinbao. Meeting a fellow villager in a foreign land, their relationship was unusually warm, and they often visited each other, which led to bringing a wolf into the house. Qian and Xinbao fell in love, and the matter gradually leaked out. Xinbao was blamed by her husband, and they could no longer coexist. Qian and Xinbao packed up their belongings and fled to Shanghai on the Ruiyang steamboat. Because they were not formally married, their actions appeared awkward, which was noticed by the accountant, who investigated and questioned them, leading to exposure. Therefore, yesterday, when the ship arrived at the port, a phone call was made to the Relief Society, and investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang boarded the ship to inquire, leading to a full confession. They were arrested and taken to the Water Police Station. Detective Cheng Yongnian was immediately dispatched to take Qian and Xinbao to the District Court. After an interrogation by the prosecutor, Qian was ordered to be detained, and Xu Xinbao was sent to the Relief Society for custody, awaiting her husband's arrival for further verification. However, when the prosecutor questioned Xu Xinbao about her age, because those under 20 years old are considered victims of abduction, he asked her when her birthday was. Surprisingly, Xinbao did not even know her own birthday, which is also a strange occurrence.</p>
<h3>Gamblers Arrested from Inside a Coffin</h3>
<p>Every night, people gathered to gamble at the Shun Da Wood Company on Wusong Outer Ma Road. This was discovered by the 7th District Public Security Bureau. The other night, at around 11 o'clock, Inspector Dai Guosheng led more than ten policemen to secretly make arrests. Upon arriving at the destination, they found that the fence gate around the company was already tightly closed, making it impossible to enter. They climbed over the fence and entered. When the gamblers saw the arrest, they all fled from the back. The inspector ordered the policemen to guard the gate and search everywhere. Soon, in the coffin storeroom, which also served as a workshop, they shone a flashlight and suddenly saw a coffin lid moving automatically. The policemen were surprised and suspicious, so they stepped forward and opened the coffin lid. To their surprise, the gamblers jumped out of the coffin one after another. They were immediately arrested one by one and taken back to the station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Drunk Man Falls into the River While Crossing and Drowns</h3>
<p>Jiang Ziyuan, from Xinzhuang, worked as a partner at the Zhenli Fujian Firm in Nanshi. Yesterday, he borrowed 15 yuan from the firm and went out, telling his colleagues that he was going to a relative's house in Zhoujiadu to participate in a hui (rotating credit association). Unexpectedly, Jiang suddenly met a friend at the South Wharf, and they went to a restaurant to drink together. Heavily drunk, his friend could not dissuade him. Jiang, fearing that he would miss the hui date, hired a boat to cross the river to Pudong. Upon arriving at the Pudong Wharf, he somehow fell into the water. The boatman could not rescue him. Later, a coal boat found his body at the Ri Hui Port. The firm learned of this and went to identify the body, confirming that it was him. They prepared a coffin and took it away, and also informed Jiang's family in Xinzhuang. The coffin was transported back. It is said that Jiang was 24 years old and had an old mother, a wife, two sons, and one daughter.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Hangs Himself on the Upper Floor</h3>
<p>Ruan Fugen, 14 years old this year, the second grandson of Ruan Heshan (74 years old) from Gaojiagang, Pudong, was an apprentice in the pawnshop opened by his relative Gu Hongqing (No. 106 Zhengjia Muqiao Street). The child was cheerful and kind and never had any disputes with anyone in the shop. It is unknown why Fugen suddenly had a pessimistic idea. The other day, at 2 p.m., he went upstairs, took an old horse bellyband, and hanged himself at the stairwell. It was not until the senior apprentice Qu Decheng went upstairs to check packages that he caught a glimpse of him. Greatly alarmed, he ran downstairs and told the shop owner, who went upstairs to check. Ruan's face was pale, and it was too late to save him. He had already died. The shop owner reported it to the French Police Station, which ordered detectives to go. They transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall morgue for examination. Meanwhile, Gu sent someone to the countryside to urge the deceased's grandfather to come to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, Zhu, the judge of the Criminal Division of the French Court, arrived at the scene and confirmed that the deceased had indeed died by hanging himself. He ordered the family of the deceased to prepare a coffin and take it away with the shop owner.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhihan Granted Transfer</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Accuses Him of Being Involved in a Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>A detective from the Shanghai Special Municipality Public Security Bureau previously accused Ma Zhihan in the French Court of being involved in the kidnapping case of Chen Tianxi and requested permission to extradite him for interrogation. The defendant's lawyer defended everything and was ordered to review the case. Yesterday, he was questioned again. The defendant's lawyer stated first that the defendant had nothing to do with the plaintiff's accusation. Now, my client is petitioning to go for questioning. The Chinese and Western judges allowed the defendant to be handed over to the officers to be taken for questioning.</p>
<h3>The Septic Tank in the Xue Family Garden Has Not Yet Been Renovated</h3>
<p>Sentenced to a Fine of 25 Yuan</p>
<p>The French Municipal Council previously accused Xue Baorun, a wealthy businessman from Xiafei Road, in the French Court of not demolishing the septic tank in his garden, which was detrimental to sanitation. He was ordered to renovate the septic tank into a Western-style toilet. Yesterday, he was summoned again. An official from the Municipal Council stated first that the defendant had ignored the order and obviously intended to defy the court's order. He requested an investigation. The defendant was notified, and someone named A substituted him and gave evasive testimony. The Chinese and Western judges ruled that the defendant should not have defied the court's order and fined him 25 yuan to be confiscated. The Public Works Bureau will still supervise the renovation.</p>

<h3>Order Abolishing University Preparatory Courses</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to all universities that they should no longer recruit preparatory students from the 19th academic year onwards. If necessary, they may run affiliated senior high schools separately. The order was published in this newspaper on the 6th of this month. The text of the order is recorded below. The establishment of preparatory courses in universities was originally an expedient measure, but universities that have not managed well often have the name of a university, but in reality, preparatory students account for the majority, and the drawbacks are too numerous to mention. According to the University Organization Law, universities are also not allowed to set up preparatory courses. All national, provincial, and private universities shall no longer recruit preparatory students from the 19th academic year onwards. The existing preparatory courses in each school should continue until the students currently enrolled in the preparatory courses have completed their studies. If there are indeed practical difficulties, the universities may be temporarily allowed to run affiliated senior high schools according to local conditions. If there are students who have graduated from the old system of middle schools and intend to take the entrance examination, they should be admitted to the school through the affiliated senior high school and assigned to the appropriate grade according to their level, in order to provide relief. In addition to distributing this order, the universities are hereby ordered to comply. This order.</p>

As for the men's division, there were originally two matches, the Jewish-Portuguese and the International-Korean, but because the Portuguese team has a number of players who will be competing in the Group A Championship match against the Vosces football team today, if they were to play two intense matches on the same day, their strength would be insufficient, therefore, they declared that the match against the Jews today would be postponed to next Thursday.

<h3>Shanghai University Defeats Jinling in Four Universities Basketball Tournament</h3>
<p>Result: 52 to 18</p>
<p>Jinling vs. Soochow Today at 3:00 PM</p>
<p>As the whistle blew, a roar of applause erupted, and the curtain rose on the Four Universities Basketball Championship. Athletic Jinling athletes and skilled Shanghai University players met in the Shanghai University gym. After a fierce battle of 40 minutes and hundreds of rounds of play, Shanghai University defeated Jinling with a score of 52 to 18. Referee: Xu Zhendong. This took place yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the first day of the championship. Today at 3:00 PM, Jinling will play against Soochow. Referee: Zhang Guoxun. The battleground remains the same.</p>
<h3>Watching the Basketball Game Causes a Sensation Throughout the School</h3>
<p>As the battle between Jinling and Shanghai University was about to begin, the atmosphere throughout Shanghai University suddenly became tense. Male and female students told each other that Jinling had outstanding talent, and this time they were confident of winning and would defeat all the heroes and take the championship trophy. They were afraid that Shanghai University would not be able to retain the honor of last year's championship. Others said that Shanghai University's basketball skills were well-known for their powerful attacks, and although Jinling was strong, they were no match for us. Even if they were not, we, along with our classmates, would come to watch the game in person, cheer together, inspire morale, and boost military morale. At that time, our army's momentum would double its power, and it would not be difficult to destroy the enemy and win. People's opinions differed, but their aspirations were the same, all were related to honor and disgrace, and the great cause was at stake. Therefore, there was a scramble for tickets to the battlefield, and people sat crowded together. The male students sat high up, with a panoramic view, and the female students sat around, with the entire field of vision, the situation of the two teams' battles was fully revealed before the eyes of these enthusiastic and caring students. Only at the beginning did they see their teeth smiling and their expressions calm, because the Shanghai University athletes lived up to expectations and had already exhausted their talents and skills, gaining a superior position. At the same time, the number of people who traveled from afar to watch was also large, and the long-desolate gym suddenly became a hot spot.</p>
<h3>Talent Varies in Each Person</h3>
<p>Shanghai University has been famous for its basketball for a while. Since He Tong was injured, the center was lacking, and the morale of the army was inevitably worried. It was also rumored from afar that Jinling's strength was strong this year and could not be surpassed, so at the beginning of the war, He Tong still entered the field and fought bravely. By the time the first half ended, Shanghai University had already secured the victory, so they changed their tactics and withdrew themselves. He's performance was difficult to match the magic of the past, but the prestige of Zhang Benjun and the capture of the enemy's spirit were greatly related to his personal performance. Liang Guoquan was smart and lively, leading the entire field. As for his many points and excellent assists, no one can match him. Ouyang Yongyuan has gradually emerged recently. Ouyang is worthy of the saying "One should look at a scholar with new eyes after he has been away three days." Wang Peng's inside guard is wonderful in its combination of rigidity and flexibility, and its balance of offense and defense. Sun Zemin's throwing has created its own style, which is indeed unique. The others can still do their jobs, and the excellent cooperation of the whole team is even more admirable. In short, Shanghai University's victory has three reasons: one is that everyone does their job, two is that the cooperation is excellent, and three is that the field is familiar. When strong enemies meet, having one or two of these is enough to defeat the enemy and win, let alone having all three. The Jinling players are tall and strong, full of spirit. When they stand in the field with heroic posture, they have the ambition that they cannot be surpassed, but unfortunately, the individual's strength is more than enough, and the cooperation of the whole team is not good enough, so they are at a disadvantage and withdraw in defeat. Forward Ling Huiyang appears all over the field, able to attack and defend, and is the pillar of the entire team. Center Tu Zhong takes care of both the front and back, and his throwing and passing are appropriate, and he is also a dangerous person. The rest of the people have both strengths and weaknesses, and their biggest problem is their slow movement. However, the qualifications are all good. Given time and training, they will soon be able to sweep across the battlefield.</p>
<h3>Talking About the Great Difference in the Strength of the Battle</h3>
<p>The order to declare war was issued, and both sides began to act. Jinling rushed forward fiercely, with great momentum. The morale of the Shanghai University army was terrified and somewhat cramped. The first to break the record of the two teams was Jinling Huiyang, followed by Shanghai University Wang Jinping. Then He Tong and Ouyang each scored one point on a penalty, and soon the situation became seven to five. At that time, Shanghai University occupied the lead, but the entire army's advance and retreat was not wonderful, so they immediately rested, the men devised a good plan, and the sound rang again, and it was effective. From then on, the entire army's arms were connected, and they swept across the field. Jinling tried hard to accelerate, but to no avail. In the first half, Shanghai University took the lead 26 to 10. In the second half, Shanghai University's generals were replaced frequently, and the ball was still strong. Jinling succumbed to the power, and it was difficult to turn around. At one point, Tu Zhongqi even scored three goals, and the situation improved, but the strength of the crossbow at the end was limited, so it soon fell again and could not get up. The result of the match was 52 to 18, a great victory for Shanghai University. Referee: Xu Zhendong.</p>

<h3>Gandhi in the Mouth of an American</h3>
<p>— Zhi Zheng</p>
<p>The famous American sociologist, Mr. Page, has come to China and has given speeches at the YMCA, which have been well-received by the general public. Yesterday, he was also invited to Jiaotong University to speak about the Indian sage Gandhi. He spoke highly of Gandhi, and here's what I remember.</p>
<p>Gandhi's appearance, Mr. Page said, Gandhi was short and weighed less than one hundred pounds. His clothes were very simple, and his appearance was ordinary. He did not eat rice or vegetables every day, he only ate a few pieces of fruit.</p>
<p>A world-class great man, he said, Gandhi studied in England in his early years. After returning to his country, he practiced law. One day, he represented a client in court, but he stuttered repeatedly during his speech and eventually left the stage red-faced. His embarrassment at the time can be imagined. After this stimulus, he devoted himself to learning even more. Gandhi, based on his life's work, was truly a great politician, a social reformer, and a saint. To be all three at once, can he not be called a world-class great man?</p>
<p>India's young widows. Early marriage is a custom in India. Children are married off at the age of four or five. After the husband dies, regardless of the wife's age, she cannot remarry. Therefore, there are quite a few Indian women who are young widows at the age of four or five. The destruction of women's happiness has reached this extreme. Gandhi shouted loudly, arousing people's attention to this matter. To this day, this trend has been slightly curbed, it is said.</p>
<p>The power of non-violent resistance. Non-violent resistance was created by Gandhi. One year, the British government ordered the Indians to submit fingerprints. Gandhi ordered the people not to go. Thousands of people were arrested. The prisons were full. The authorities were terrified. After the Indian people were released, they still refused to submit. The British were eventually helpless. Gandhi's advocacy of passive resistance against the British particularly emphasized economic severance. Therefore, the British forces in India were greatly hit by Gandhi. Today, Gandhi even sent a letter of protest to the Indian Governor, implementing his non-violent resistance. Its momentum can be known.</p>
<p>A stone from another mountain. After Mr. Page finished his speech, the audience responded with enthusiastic applause. Gandhi, as a citizen of a subjugated country, led the masses, implemented economic severance with non-cooperation, and eventually made the British submit. People in our country, who are also in a semi-colonial situation, hear this and cannot remain unmoved. The lecture of Mr. Page probably contains a deep meaning.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Female Bandit Who Sold Entertainment</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>The old servant Ya Ci came from Huzhou. He told me that it was very difficult to travel to Huzhou. Because today, bandits are everywhere. There are direct steamships from Shanghai to Huzhou. But a month ago, they were robbed several times. Timid people regard it as a dangerous road. They changed to take the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Jiaxing, and then take a boat to Huzhou. The mileage is faster. Unexpectedly, this Jiaxing bus was also looted in the previous ten days. The losses were quite heavy, and the journey was full of thorns. He said with fear. Ya Ci lives in the countryside, close to Taihu Lake. He mentioned two female bandits in Taihu Lake, who are extremely fierce. What he said is credible.</p>
<p>Taihu Lake has crisscrossing harbors and channels, which are not navigable by those unfamiliar with the routes. Over the years, many bandits have gathered in between. Most of them are from the Hunan gang and the Jiangbei gang. Thatched houses are hidden, and fishing boats are hidden. This is the easiest place to hide. However, the heroes of the green forest are all strong men. Even if there is a "wife in the stronghold," she has never shown her face. It was not until last year when Wucheng and Erzhen were ravaged by bandits that two female bandits were seen. They held box cannons and directed things. So the residents paid attention. It is said that there are female bandits in Taihu Lake. According to residents of Taihu Lake, one of the female bandits is about thirty years old, and the other is less than thirty. They wear short clothes and foot bindings, cut their hair short, and wear hats. The older one is fierce and terrifying. The younger one has a decent face. She used to be a female entertainer, traveling through the border between Zhejiang and Jiangsu, earning money by performing acrobatics. The villagers in Xunzhen still have vague memories of her. It is unknown how she became a bandit. The female bandits are agile and walk very fast. They speak with a Shandong accent. They also drive boats in Taihu Lake from time to time. The fishermen in Taihu Lake point them out whenever they meet them. Since the Zhejiang provincial authorities have been searching and suppressing them strictly, the bandits have recently subsided slightly.</p>
<h3>New Discussion on Rat Extermination</h3>
<p>— Ji Jin</p>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reported the other day that in a house in Taiheng Lane, North Sichuan Road, in this city, a mother and child were both bitten by rats. It was later reported to the Bureau of Health, which tried to search and arrest them, but only caught two or three small rats. The larger ones escaped, fearing future troubles. I say that the harm caused by rats exists everywhere. I have never heard of anyone being seriously injured by a rat bite. Now I will discuss the art of rat extermination with my friends, and briefly record it below to inform the readers.</p>
<p>Western methods of rat extermination are countless. Generally, stores, households, and ships must spray toxic gas once every three months to avoid the occurrence of nuclear plague, ringworm, rat malaria, rat plague, and various diseases. This is of course perfect. I do not know that rats are very cunning, coming and going suddenly, and unpredictable. There are even those who board ships to cross the ocean, and those who take cars to go to foreign countries. Recently, small mice have been found in airplanes in some places in the United States. What a strange thing. Everyone knows that their reproduction is very fast. One female rat can give birth about six times a year, about five or six at a time. According to the world's statistical report, there are currently more than nine thousand trillion rats. Extermination is endless, what to do?</p>
<p>According to a recent Western magazine, London, England, initiated a city-wide rat extermination conference. It is scheduled to be held simultaneously on a certain day of a certain month, and a rat extermination liquid will be sprayed by machine. This liquid contains an excessively strong irritant, which makes the rats feel feverish all over when they smell it. They want to die but cannot. They leave their burrows and seek shade. When they encounter cold air, the poison is released and they die immediately. It will never rot in the burrow and cause a rat plague. This medicine is called Cogesters water. It was invented by Dr. Cogesters of the Royal Hospital, so it is named after him. It is said that the test is effective and will be sold to various countries so that rats will be exterminated.</p>
<h3>New Couplet</h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>Madame Wu, the former president of Lebanon, passed away a few days ago. Mr. Li Genyuan, the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, is currently living in seclusion in the Qionglong Mountains of Suzhou. He specially made a couplet to mourn her, which he sent. "Who in the eyes is like Madame? I still remember the country's many difficulties. In Zhai clothing and hairpin, she diligently warned at dawn. If you meet the President in heaven, tell her that I am safe and sound in the mountains, and I miss her for a long time in the wind and rain of the green lamp." Signed as "The Spiritual Banner of Madame Wu, the Great President." Respectfully mourned by Li Genyuan.</p>
<h3>Continued Record of Zhang Fei's Head</h3>
<p>— Chen Shuping</p>
<p>Previously, this publication published a section about Zhang Fei's head in the Shu Temple, which attracted the attention of readers. Everyone wants to know the truth in detail. Pharmacist Zhang Jun Yongxiang is a man who is well-versed in the world, knowledgeable, and sincere. He has the air of a Confucian scholar. He came to Shanghai from Sichuan. Last night, I met him at the banquet and immediately asked him about this matter. According to his confirmed account, the temple placed a huge vat in the center of the main hall, filled with cooking oil. The so-called head of Zhang Fei is immersed in it. A thin chain is attached to the end of the hair, which hangs down from the pulley in the beam. Visitors who want to see it must first pay a certain amount of incense money, and then the monk will use the chain to bring out the head. Only a round object wrapped in oiled paper can be seen, as big as a watermelon. There are many official seals on the paper. A black halberd beard is slightly exposed at the lower end. Judging from the beard, the horror of its appearance can be imagined. The monk said that the head was once publicly exhibited, waiting with round eyes and a swallow's jaw, as fierce as alive. Children who saw it were often frightened and became ill, or even died. The local officials then prohibited it from being shown to people. An edict was issued to wrap it up to avoid causing trouble again. Is the Third General not worshipped as a god by the world? However, the most important part of his remains is not buried in the yellow earth, but floats in oil. Is it blasphemy or respect? This is a question. If it is said that it is imitating the preservation methods of the Western museums, the reason is difficult to establish. One is that our country's customs are very different from those of the West. We have always valued the view of being buried in the earth. Except for the Ming Dynasty's punishment of death, there is no precedent for hanging one's head high to show respect. Moreover, a century ago, people still lacked this new idea, especially in the closed province of Sichuan where transportation was inconvenient. Or, it is said that this is a trick by the monks to collect money, and there is no value in research. I don't know if it is true. I hope that the comrades in that place can conduct a detailed investigation using scientific methods and make an accurate report. I believe it is also what the readers would like to hear.</p>
<p>Ping notes that the head has been discovered for a long time. Although the exact date cannot be verified, it must be at least over a hundred years old. Therefore, "a century ago" refers to the day when the temple was exhibited to the public. However, how the monks obtained it is a big question.</p>
<h3>Random Talk on Making Letter Paper</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenlü</p>
<p>In recent years, I have been engaged in the business of making letter paper. Fortunately, the three words "Liang Chen Jian" have been widely accepted by the people. Adopted by each other. Last year, I wrote "Random Talk on Making Letter Paper" based on what I learned from making letter paper and published it in this newspaper. The other day, a guest came to Qingtan. Making letter paper is the way. He left in the middle of the night. I suddenly felt lonely and recorded a note to serve as my footprint.</p>
<p>If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools. Making letter paper is a trivial matter. The words and paintings must be free from vulgarity as the minimum condition. Whether the printing plate is made of zinc or copper, clarity is the most important. If you use movable type to arrange lines and grids, you must use good materials. However, new lead lines have edges that are too sharp due to the edge. Light printing does not leave traces. Heavy printing may break thin paper. Copper wire is better because it is more durable. The printing plate may be the edge of a book. New book edges may have defects in the casting process that cause sand holes. The print looks like pinholes. Old materials are out of the question. Or arrange flower borders, or because the size of the body is too big or too small compared to the planned size of the printing plate. It is too much or too little, and cannot be exactly right. Or because the alignment of the patterns is not accurate, the skilled worker uses his brain to seek a seamless match. The time spent is immeasurable. There are wired printing plates and special printing plates. Zinc and copper printing plates have wooden supports, which are larger than the printing surface. When the characters and paintings on the printing surface are printed, they are far away from the lines and grids, and are not in the Chinese style. Then the skilled worker must use his brain again, or file the edge of the wooden bottom, or cut the bottom of the lead wire, or arrange the lead material vertically and horizontally to maintain it, or line it with thin paper or thick paper to stabilize it. The time spent is immeasurable again. Once the printing plate is ready, the quality of the printing press is another important key to making letter paper. The softness, hardness, expansion, and contraction of the ink glue, the thickness, thinness, and gloss of the ink are all obstacles to printing. The height of the bottom of the printing plate and the flatness of the machine surface are matters for the printing workers. The printing matters are ready. The quality of the paper material, whether it is suitable for this printing plate or not, whether it is suitable for this ink or not, must also be considered. The uniformity of the paper edge is enough to ruin the beauty of the entire letter paper. Therefore, if a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools. Although the tools are sharp, the craftsman must also be skilled. Making letter paper is a trivial matter. The difficulty is like this. How can hundreds of industries not be like this? Zhu Bailu has said, "Every thread and every strand, we must always remember that material resources are hard-won." It is indeed worth remembering.</p>
<h3>Nanfeng Orange</h3>
<p>— Zhi Zheng</p>
<p>Nanfeng County in Jiangxi Province is the hometown of the ancient prose writer Zeng Zigou. The world calls Zeng Nanfeng Mr. Zeng, just like today's Duan Hefei and Zhang Nantong. Nanfeng is not a prosperous place, but the "Nanfeng Orange" is its specialty. Its shape is extremely small, only about one-fifth of the size of those sold on the market. It looks like a lotus coin and is pleasing to the eye. When the skin is removed and eaten, it tastes extremely sweet. The smaller it is, the better it tastes. Therefore, one can easily eat dozens of them at a time. To choose the large ones when buying Nanfeng oranges will surely be laughed at by those in the know. Many farmers in the area grow this. However, because the demand is wide, it is no longer available above Nanchang, let alone Xunhu. My friend Tan Jun Zanhua came to Shanghai from Jiangxi in the new year, bringing a basket of Nanfeng oranges, about hundreds of them. He shared them with his friends, who liked their unique flavor. Therefore, I occasionally talked about it.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (143)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Celebrated Figures Hilariously Play Hide-and-Seek; A Charming Lady Voluntarily Provides Protection</p>
<p>Speaking of hide-and-seek. Ruiyun was also very enthusiastic. Speaking of hide-and-seek...we must think of the time at the Mingjing Club. That time can be regarded as a large-scale game of hide-and-seek. Among the men...there were Xiong Pingshan, Yi Hu'an, Zhang Junheng, Shi Guanping, Yan Yichen, Zheng Yanxiu, Zuo Shichen, Zhen Cuixia, etc. Among the women...there were Zhao Yuxiang, Yiqing Xian Guan, Shi Yunlai, Hong Sibao, Su Jun, Chen Jiangyun, Hua Ruiyun, etc. It can also be regarded as extremely lively. Among this group of people...later, there were those who became Prime Ministers, those who became Ministers of Departments, and those who became Presidents of Banks. Among the women, most of them were probably girls from the brothel, or mostly concubines of others. But after twenty years, looking back...everyone who attended that night of hide-and-seek is still alive. However, among the men...the young have become middle-aged, and the middle-aged have become old. Those with bare chins have grown beards. Among the women, they have naturally gradually changed from slim young ladies to aging courtesans. But the laughter, the tinkling of pearls, and the chaos of hairpins at that time are worth remembering. At that time, among this group of girls, the most active were Yiqing and Yunlai. Ruiyun was also very active at home...but when she came outside...she was not very good at making noise. After all, she was too young...she did not have the sophistication of Yiqing and Yunlai. The game of hide-and-seek...was also initiated by Yiqing and others. She said, "When I was a child, I was the naughtiest, and I was the best at kicking shuttlecocks and jumping rope. At first, my mother wanted to bind my feet...she bound them tightly during the day...and I didn't feel anything. But at night...when I got hot, my bound feet hurt even more. I didn't care, and I tore off the foot bindings in the quilt. When my mother saw that I didn't cry in pain...she was a little suspicious...she ran over and lifted the quilt to take a look...a quilt full of foot bindings...like a new batch of beltfish arriving from Ningbo...a pair of feet were exposed outside...she was so angry that she wanted to beat me with a chicken feather duster. Fortunately, my father said...in the middle of the night...hitting a child...disturbing the neighbors...what are you doing? Now many young ladies in mansions don't bind their feet...and there are Tianzu Associations everywhere...so just let it be. My mother said...young ladies in mansions don't have to bind their feet...but we small families cannot do without foot binding." She scolded my father...but in the end, she let it go. Once my feet were not bound...it was much more comfortable. When playing hide-and-seek...no one can catch me. Yan Yichen laughed and said...such an old person...still like a child...only talking about hide-and-seek. Yiqing said...what's so strange about that? We played this game with a few younger sisters the night before last. Yunlai echoed her and said...hide-and-seek depends on being physically active...so that you are not caught by others. If you are dull...it won't work. Shi Guanping was also a person who liked excitement...he said...are you playing hide-and-seek? You can play it here.</p>

<h3>Exchange Rates Change from Tight to Loose</h3>

As for the local foreign exchange market, the domestic market went from tight to loose, rising and falling alternately, actually reflecting the trend of the gold standard moving from high to low. The market was very confused, with constant changes, causing people to feel uncertain. Chinese merchants and speculators, as well as those in the gold industry, still mostly sold off. It is estimated that about 200,000 pounds sterling were sold in total. Although the banks' appetite was not thin, it was not very strong either. Banks such as HSBC, Jardine Matheson, Banque Franco-Chinoise, Banque Industrielle de Chine, Andes, Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Shanghai all made purchases. Shanghai only sold a small amount.

Banks such as Mitsui sold Dalian futures, while the Bank of East Asia, Banque Industrielle de Chine, and Bank of Taiwan purchased June futures, probably because the hedging did not match.

<h3>Interbank Lending Situation Eases Slightly</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Previously, interbank lending was affected by the large discrepancy in the amount of promissory notes being discounted, leading to many crises. Yesterday, the situation was slightly better than the day before, but it was still not as stable as usual. Trading in discounted notes in the market could still be accommodated. Fortunately, the silver shortage among various firms yesterday was mainly maintained by shareholders contributing cash, allowing them to navigate the risks. The trading situation was stimulated by this, so it should not be used for formal purposes.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rates: The "foreign interest rate" was 7 qian 2 fen 0 and a half li in the early market, and 7 qian 2 fen 0 and 7 hao and a half li in the afternoon market, a more favorable trend than before. Trading was also slightly more active than in the previous few days. The "silver interest rate" consistently involved borrowing in kind because discounted notes were not being used. There were no prices available in the market. However, bank transfers had higher rates due to more receipts, with 7 or 8 fen added, the only high price this year.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small silver coins were 6 qian 1 fen 1 li and a half in the early market and 6 qian 1 fen 3 li in the afternoon market. The trading volume was 6,000 jiao in the early market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins were 5 qian 9 fen 8 li and a half in the early market and 5 qian 9 fen 9 li and 2 hao and a half in the afternoon market. The trading volume was 115,000 jiao in the early market and 90,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins decreased by another 2,000 wen to 394,000 wen, with a trading volume of over 25,000 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver funds" received by banks yesterday included over 2 million from Chinese merchants and 1.4 to 1.5 million from foreign merchants. Various cargo exchange taxes and miscellaneous funds received amounted to about 7 million, with special receipts of 2 to 3 million, and 1.8 million entering the warehouse. Japanese banks received over 2.8 million from various funds and 700,000 entered the warehouse. The amounts received by Chinese banks and silver public associations could not be estimated due to various reasons. Transfers received amounted to over 7 million, and cash disbursements amounted to several million. Exchange funds received from various routes amounted to over 600,000. "Foreign funds" exchange transfers amounted to 1.04 million in the early market and 1.015 million in the afternoon market. Only 15,000 banknotes were traded in the afternoon market. Off-exchange banknotes amounted to only 63,000 in the afternoon market. Bank trading amounted to 400,000 in the early market and 500,000 in the afternoon market. More than 1.1 million in foreign accounts were received and disbursed between various banks. Banknote inflow and outflow amounted to 1.5 to 1.6 million. Chinese banks and foreign public associations received 4.7 to 4.8 million. Foreign transfers received amounted to 1.4 to 1.5 million. Foreign currency lending amounted to over 700,000. Trading between small Chinese banks amounted to 400,000 to 500,000.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flower Market Situation Unfolds, Yarn Market Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned firm, with a relatively sharp upward trend, but the overseas brocade market still trended downward. This was because the news regarding the situation was good, leading to a decrease in new sellers, and profit-taking sellers took the opportunity to cover their short positions, causing the market to rise sharply and the situation to tighten. Some customer groups were more active, and Tianjin businesses were suddenly strong in their purchases. If actual sales can follow, there is still a potential for a two-tael increase.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Rose One or Two Tael: In the previous market, although foreign cotton fell, the market sentiment was firm. As the situation turned positive, many buyers came to the market, and the market sentiment tightened steadily. All months rose by 2, 6, 7, and 8 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that Tianjin businesses had strong demand for spot yarn, and market sentiment became firmer, with more people covering their short positions. All months rose again by 3, 5, 6, and 8 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 18,250 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Turns to Stability</h3>
<p>The cotton market trend is still tight, as buyers are holding tight and buying more when prices fall. However, American cotton continues to trend downwards, and spot sales remain quiet. Factories are less interested in purchasing Indian cotton due to its lower market price, and most are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The cotton market situation is particularly uncertain.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Rebounded by More Than 1 Qian: In the morning session, although American cotton fell, the lack of new sellers caused the market sentiment to rebound. All months rose by 5 fen to 1 qian. The market situation remained firm in the afternoon, with near-term rising by 5 fen and far-term rising by 1 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 23,100 dan. The closing prices of Hankou Standard are recorded on the left:</p>

<h3>Overseas Telegrams: Yarn Rises, Cotton Falls</h3>
<p>American Cotton is Being Dumped in the South: Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to long positions being liquidated and the South selling off, but later it firmed up due to some short positions being covered. Futures fell by 5 to 20 points, and spot fell by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 20 points, and spot fell by 14 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 25 points. Indian cotton initially fell slightly following American cotton, but later it rebounded due to purchases by Japanese merchants. Pingle rose by 1 rupee, and far-term rose and fell by 1 rupee. Omar fell by 1 rupee, and far-term fell by 1 to 2 rupees. White Luo Creek remained unchanged for near and far terms. The original telegram is recorded on the left: (6th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Recent Overview of the Sanpin Exchange</h3>
<p>Arbitration and Special Appraisal of Yarn and Flower Quality</p>
<p>Are Both Solved Accurately with Scientific Instruments</p>
<p>The Osaka Sanpin Exchange, which primarily deals in cotton yarn and cotton futures, gets its name "Sanpin" from the three commodities it was originally intended to trade: cotton, yarn, and cotton cloth. Later, only yarn transactions remained, but two years ago, raw cotton trading resumed. Raw cotton trading is based on 7/8-inch Strict Middling and the standard is strict. SuictMidlio of a quarter of a dan is the basis, and the unit is 10 bales of American cotton (i.e., 36 dan). The standard for cotton yarn is Toyo Cotton Factory's 20-count Goldfish brand, which was decided by the Exchange's Board of Directors in 1927. Each month, the Standards Committee appraises the standard quality of each factory's cotton yarn once, and determines the differential amount to be added or subtracted above or below the standard. Furthermore, if there are differences of opinion regarding the determination of cotton or cotton yarn standards, the Exchange has instruments that measure quality based on scientific principles to make a determination. These instruments are also used in cases of arbitration. The Exchange's rules stipulate that futures trading in cotton or cotton yarn must be conducted using auction methods. However, delivery procedures can be used when specially specified or deemed necessary. In the auction market, brokers must report the price and the quantity they wish to buy or sell. All such trading quantities are temporarily recorded in the market transaction register, and the two parties continue to negotiate prices until the average price of all trades is determined. However, purchases and sales made by the same broker are deemed to offset each other unless specifically stated.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market: Indica Rice Is Firm While Japonica Is Soft</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, boats continued to arrive from the river. Sales of northern japonica rice were very sluggish. The buying interest was still acceptable in the early morning, but it quickly turned quiet. The overall market was high at the start but then weakened. There was little trading in thin rice due to the rainy weather. Sellers, fearing that buyers would force prices down, were also not eager to sell quickly. Yangdu indica rice was thriving due to the success of foreign rice. Sales were active, and arrivals were very rare. Prices tended to be firm. The same was true for indica rice from customer ports. All prices were raised by a corner. White yuan rice was average and unremarkable, with no gains or losses for the time being.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Boats arrived frequently from the river. Businesses in this street had mixed intentions. Customers for Changshu, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Tongzhou japonica rice were few. Prices had to be lowered by about half a corner. The market situation was extremely weak. The market situation for early indica rice from the southern groups was even weaker. Although it had been in short supply for days, it could not stimulate sales. Prices continued to weaken. Yangdu indica rice also followed the Saigon Small Refined and rose. The buying interest was very good, and the market price was called tight by a corner. General variation was sluggish, and customer routes were somewhat established in ports. Sales were quiet, and prices were average.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Hovers, Slightly on the Stable Side</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning and afternoon, the various months generally hovered. Although actual sales in this month were not active, there was hope for peace in the northern situation. Based on past examples, sales could gradually improve, so in the midst of hovering, there was a slight sense of stability. April and May were slightly higher due to stable sentiment. June initially reached 2 taels 3 qian, but in the afternoon, the weather</p>
<p>turned sunny, and sentiment softened slightly. July and August were both new flour, and it was difficult to distinguish between them, so the buying interest in July was relatively better, and the price was slightly firmer. Looking ahead, if there are no unexpected changes in the financial situation, the far-term months should see more buying than selling at present. As a result, this month was better by 5 li compared to the previous day, April was unchanged, May was better by 5 li, June was better by 5 li, July was better by 5 li, and August was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Standard Wheat Showed Another Uptick</h3>
<p>Spot Volume Opened at 11,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the futures wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, near and far terms showed another uptick. Although quoted prices for foreign wheat fluctuated from time to time, there were no actual orders. March and April are in the period between harvests. Although the amount of goods accumulated in this port is about 100,000 dan, less than 20-30% meet the exchange's standards. Therefore, the standard market is getting better step by step. As a result, the closing prices for this month and March-April were better by 2 fen each compared to the previous day, June was better by 1 fen, July was unchanged, and August was better by 1 fen. Spot wheat of various grades remained stable. Large and small factories were very eager to purchase. Kaiming Guang wheat was at 5 taels 1 qian 7 fen, Qingjiangpu wheat was at 5 taels 1 qian 6 fen, Anqing wheat was at 5 taels 1 qian 2 fen, Gaoyou wheat was at 5 taels 0 qian 7 fen to 0 qian 5 fen, Bianjiang wheat was at 4 taels 9 qian 2 fen, Shashi wheat was at 4 taels 9 qian 5 fen, Yangzhou wheat was at 5 taels 1 qian to 0 qian 8 fen, Hankou wheat was at 4 taels 9 qian 8 fen to 3 qian 4 fen, Jiangxi wheat was at 5 taels 0 qian 7-8 fen, and Wuxi wheat was at 4 taels 9 qian 2 fen. A total of 11,000 bags were opened, and were purchased by factories such as Fuxin, Fufeng, Shenda, and Xinda.</p>
<h3>Small Refined Rice Rose Uniquely by 2 Jiao and a Half</h3>
<p>Hankou, Ningbo, and Mainland Purchases Were Active</p>
<p>Saigon Large Refined Rice Followed Up by a Corner</p>
<p>Yesterday's Foreign Rice Market Situation: The situation continued to improve. In addition to brisk purchases in the mainland and this street, new inquiries came from Hankou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Wenzhou groups. Sentiment became even more optimistic. Demand for Small Refined Rice was particularly strong, and the price rose sharply by as much as 2 jiao and a half. Other types of rice followed, rising by a corner. A total of nearly 10,000 bags of Small Refined Rice were opened, with prices ranging from 13 yuan 7 jiao to 3 jiao and a half. 1,500 bags of Large Refined Rice were opened, with a price of 13 yuan 1 jiao. 1,500 bags of Saigon No. 1 were opened, with a price of 14 yuan 7 jiao and a half. 500 bags of No. 2 were opened, with a price of 13 yuan 7 jiao. Futures rice sales were also strong. In addition to repurchases, Rixin, Mitsui, Fuji, and other firms sold off, but the market price was also better by 1-2 fen to 5-6 fen.</p>
<h3>Hardware and Black Iron Sheets Sell Like Crazy</h3>
<p>Hardware Transactions: Actual sales have been greatly reduced due to the tight silver situation in the market recently. Customer groups and factories only replenished essential items, and most transactions were very quiet. However, black iron sheet transactions were very active yesterday due to strong appetites from factories (enamel factories, packaging factories). The market goods were almost exhausted, and the standard upward trend was very strong. 2-foot 6-inch 18-sheet could open up to 9 taels 3 qian, another increase of 1 qian and a half compared to the previous day. However, the market goods were very tight due to the limited supply, and it was extremely firm. The 3-foot 6-inch goods also rose a lot due to the good trend of the 2-foot 6-inch goods. Among them, the 13-sheet was the most popular among buyers, with a price of 9 taels 2 qian and a half. The remaining 9 taels were sold and transactions were made in 600-700 bundles yesterday.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>Longkou Vermicelli has been in short supply recently, and the inventory in Shanghai is thin. Currently, Fujian and the mainland have been purchasing, and the asking price has reached 22 taels and a half.</p>
<p>Raw silk fell sharply. Overseas telegrams indicated that prices remained small. Chinese silk merchants were unwilling to sell cheaply at a loss. Yesterday, only Shen Yu advanced 10 bundles of Shanghai White Factory warp, Xinfu advanced 20 bundles of Lu Yellow Factory warp, and Yuanchang advanced 5 bundles of White Da warp.</p>
<p>According to news from foreign firms in this port, the Moroccan tea market is sluggish.</p>

<p>About 200 bundles of Zhangzhou Turquoise sugar arrived yesterday. Samples have been issued, but sales have not yet started.</p>
<p>Since the financial turmoil, trading in the sugar industry has become increasingly quiet. Spot goods have also not been heard to be traded.</p>

<h3>Artists and the Masses</h3>
<p>— Baoluo Duo</p>
<p>Every individual within the masses asks for very little from life within the crowd—merely the right to survive. If anything obstructs their right to survive, they have no choice but to revolt. The revolt of the masses is, in fact, a very justified action. Therefore, in our history, all major disturbances since ancient times should be celebrated as the majority's demand for the right to survive. Regarding this point, even the sage-like figures among the scholar-officials who specialized in suppressing mass movements understood it clearly. For the sake of governing the country and bringing peace to the world, a tendency towards a frugal and simple life naturally arose among Chinese scholar-officials. As a result, all magnificent and ornate decorations were rejected, and culture centered on artistic thought was extremely despised. Because of this, every artist under traditional Chinese thought has always been subjected to unexpected maltreatment. As long as one lived a frugal and simple life, from the emperor (the most famous being Emperor Wen of Han) to the common people, they were all praised. Even in the past ten years or so, despite the fundamental shaking of all previous Chinese thought, those who live a frugal and simple life are still praised. The enjoyment of life centered on artistic thought is something that people in the crowd dare not openly proclaim. Therefore, in our China, there are at least two kinds of life forms: one that can be told to others, and another that cannot. Moreover, under traditional Chinese thought, the latter is unnecessary. Since the life of every artist is naturally different from that of every individual in the masses, then the life of every artist is one that does not need to be told to others. As for the life that the majority demands, it is always very modest—merely the desire to survive. Everything is something that can be told to others, and after others hear it, they will never express dissatisfaction because of it. In short, in a country that worships art, the life of an artist that everyone praises is one that does not need to be told to others in China. Otherwise, they will be subjected to considerable insults, forcing them to come out and deny it in the newspaper. Under such traditional thought, every artist in China who aspires to further their development is still forced to accept everything centered on a frugal and simple life. They are frugal in their enjoyment and monotonous in their lives. In the end, none of them has the life of an artist that everyone praises in a country that worships art.</p>
<p>The life of every artist will never conflict with the life of every individual in the masses.</p>
<p>After most people wake up at dawn, many of their actions are naturally the same as others. Let's list a few of the most important ones below—dressing and eating go without saying. In addition, there is definitely a fixed job every day (of course, washing the face and the like are not included). Living like this day after day, over time, everyone will feel that life is too boring when they are about to die. Every artist should attach great importance to the enjoyment of life. The reason why life is interesting is all because artists shout it out. However, the daily dressing, washing the face, eating, and other fixed jobs are all lives that can be told to others.</p>
<p>Let me say a few blunt words, "One person's waste may be a sin, but a nation's waste should be a cultural enjoyment."</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say, "As long as it is an excellent nation, there is no lack of waste and squandering in the enjoyment of life. However, this situation is unlikely to happen in China."</p>
<h3>Writers and Their Remuneration</h3>
<p>— Moli</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the most expensive manuscripts now belong to former US President Coolidge and Governor Smith. Publishers offered a reward of one yuan per word, asking them to write about their personal experiences in politics and society. As a result, Coolidge's six-month writing career earned him more than his annual salary as president (according to British newspapers).</p>
<p>A fee of one yuan per word is indeed considerable, but it cannot be said to be unprecedented. In foreign countries, there are actually many precedents. Several years ago, a scholar from Indiana in the United States, named Whitcomb Riley, wrote a poem called "An Old Sweetheart of Mine." The initial reward for this poem was extremely meager, just a drop in the bucket of his income at the time. But year after year, the number of people reading his poem gradually increased. So, the scenes described in the poem were also painted by very famous artists, creating many beautiful and moving pictures. In this way, his poem "An Old Sweetheart of Mine" almost became a poem that everyone must read. Before his death, the reward he received from that poem was almost five hundred yuan per word. What an astonishing number!</p>
<p>This can be regarded as the highest reward in writing. However, there are many other precedents that prove that poetry can also be rewarded. Alexander Pope translated Homer's epic "Iliad" and received 50,000 yuan. Before Sir Walter Scott became famous for his novels, he was already a "poet" who galloped in the literary world at that time. His popular long poem "Lady of the Lake" received a reward of 15,000 yuan. Also, the British publisher Sir Smith paid 25,000 yuan to have Tennyson write a poem as long as "Idylls of the King". But compared to that, Milton's "Paradise Lost" received a total of only fifty yuan. This amount is too far apart.</p>
<p>The above is mostly the luck of writers. However, on the other hand, there are also many frustrated ones. Edgar Allan Poe was satisfied with getting ten yuan for a short story. Thomas Carlyle's most proud year in his life, his literary earnings were less than a thousand yuan. Beatrice Harraden wrote a novel "Ships That Pass in the Night" and immediately sold it for a hundred yuan. Who knew that after it was published, sales were booming, creating an opportunity for booksellers to make a fortune out of thin air.</p>
<p>But now, this unfair treatment seems to have been eliminated. We are very happy to know how Conan Doyle, who wrote the Sherlock Holmes detective novels, went from poverty to wealth. The year Sherlock Holmes first appeared, which was also the year Conan Doyle first wrote detective novels, was 1887. That novel was called "A Study in Scarlet," and it was 25,000 words long. At that time, the author was still a medical student struggling with his environment. Before it was published, he encountered many difficulties, almost causing him to destroy his manuscript. It was not until someone bought the manuscript that he received a reward of 125 yuan. However, this amount was already much higher than what he used to get from people's random donations. In the first eight or nine years of his writing career, he often wrote late into the night without stopping, but he did not earn eight or nine hundred yuan in any year. Now, the situation is different from before. The copyright for "Sir Nigel" sold for 25,000 yuan. Since then, Sherlock Holmes's works have averaged two yuan per word. Twenty years ago, someone made a statistic of Conan Doyle's writing income, and the total was 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Forty years ago, the young Kipling, like the young Conan Doyle, would have been happier to receive one or two hundred yuan for their work than to receive ten or twenty thousand yuan. Moreover, the one or two hundred yuan at that time could help them suffer less material hardship. When Kipling went from London to New York with two proud manuscripts, "Many Inventions" and "The Story of the Gadsbys," he said to the publisher, "There are countless Indian stories in here, countless interesting Indian stories." He almost wanted to hang up a big discount banner like the Shanghai stores, saying, "I'm having a big sale!" Indeed, Kipling was eager to "ship goods" at that time. He only asked for fifty yuan for that manuscript. However, most publishers smiled and shook their heads at him, saying, "We are not interested in Indian stories." Kipling was desperate, but in this despair, a glimmer of new hope arose. An editor heard his bitter pleas and generously offered fifty yuan to buy one of his manuscripts. But when he brought it back and looked at it carefully, he regretted it. "What is this?" the editor said as he stuffed the manuscript into a drawer and left it to rot.</p>
<p>A few years later, Kipling's novel "A Man from Nowhere" was published. At that time, he was at the height of his fame, and sales were booming. The author and editor were gathered together, congratulating each other. When the editor saw Kipling, he suddenly remembered something. He said, "What's going on? Oh, aren't you Mr. Kipling? Oh no, that novel is still in my drawer!" As he said this, he stopped drinking and hurried to the office to find Kipling's novel from a pile of discarded manuscripts. He immediately urged the typesetting room to print it.</p>
<p>The story is getting further and further away, almost from "writers and their remuneration" to anecdotes about writers. Let me talk about two more people and bring this to a close. I have already talked about Scott above, but now I have a few more words to add. When his literary fame was at its peak, he received 40,000 yuan for each of his novels. Unfortunately, from 1826 to 1828, Scott's publishing business suffered heavy losses. In these years, his income from manuscripts reached 200,000 yuan, and he used almost all of this 200,000 yuan to pay back his creditors. In 1851, nineteen years after his death, Adam Black paid 27,000 gold pounds to buy the reprinting rights to many of his novels. Two years later, Routledge bought most of his novels for 100,000 yuan and reprinted them on cheap paper so that the selling price would be low enough for the general readers to afford.</p>
<p>The Irish poet Thomas Moore owed 15,000 yuan and was unable to repay it. Byron knew about it and immediately wrote a novel and gave it to him. This was not a mere empty gesture of friendship, because Mr. Loueman paid 15,000 yuan to buy the copyright, and knowing that Moore was poor, he also gave him 8,000 yuan. Byron's emphasis on chivalry and righteousness is also evident.</p>

<h3>Jinan University Female Students Hold March 8th Women's Day Commemoration: Wang Ying</h3>
<p>Jinan University female students held a March 8th Women's Day commemoration meeting today, inviting celebrities to give speeches, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, the article "March 8th and Chinese Women" submitted by Wang Ying, a female student of the school, is published below.</p>
<p>March 8th is the International Women's Day anniversary, and it is also a good opportunity for female intellectuals to unite comrades and seek practical emancipation for women.</p>
<p>International women, because they could not endure the pain of oppression, there was the production of the Copenhagen Congress in Denmark on March 8, 1909. As a result, it was decided that March 8th would be Women's Day. Its purpose is to seek bread and peace, and to protect female workers. In 1910, women from Germany and Austria also gathered more than 20,000 women in Vienna to hold a large-scale demonstration. Later, countries responded, and every "March 8th," women would gather to hold a conference, on the one hand to express commemoration, and on the other hand to put forward the items that women themselves require, compile them into slogans, so as to arouse the attention of women and men from all walks of life in the society, and to implement the policy of emancipation.</p>
<p>The reason why international women can have their current status—escaping the pain of oppression, the equality of economic status between women and men, and the equality of professional status between women and men—is all related to the effect of the women's movement. Look at the women in our China. Even now, they still cannot completely escape the pain of oppression. The economic status of women and men still cannot be fully equal. The professional status of women and men also has many inequalities. In recent years, although there have been a few lucky ones who have had the opportunity to receive education, there are still a very large number of pitiful insects who are swallowing their voices and enduring, suffering from the heavy oppression in the society, living that inhuman life, and not daring to struggle and resist a little bit, as if waiting there, the female savior and the enlightened in the intellectual world, to find ways to rescue them from the fiery pit for the pitiful insects.</p>
<p>Chinese women have many sufferings, which cannot be described in detail for a while, and are limited by the length of the article. Only the most painful ones are briefly described as follows: (1) The suffering of prostitutes. The life of prostitutes is the most bitter. They must force a smile when they are not happy, force themselves to drink when they cannot win, force themselves to accompany when they are not happy, and force themselves to sing when they are not feeling well. If they encounter guests with bad tempers, they will be insulted and scolded if they do not agree with them, otherwise they will be trampled all night, which is unbearable. Alas, their lives are really not as good as pigs and dogs. Look at the wild chickens soliciting customers by the roadside in Shanghai every night. Their pitiful state is really better than beggars. (2) The suffering of peasant and worker women. They work like cattle and horses all day long, and the rewards they get are extremely small. If they encounter family members with bad tempers, they will be beaten and scolded even more, giving them inhuman treatment. (3) The suffering of women in old etiquette families. The slave life of male supremacy and female inferiority, marriage is not autonomous, and women will never have the opportunity to study.</p>
<p>In short, the suffering of Chinese women is difficult to describe in a word. The current March 8th is the only life-saving festival for our Chinese women. Therefore, we must expand publicity, gather women from all walks of life, and invite male comrades from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about the women's movement to hold a commemorative meeting, and jointly discuss the vital issues and demands of women. We must work hard and strive to attack towards the bright road, and we will not stop until we reach our goal. Our slogans are: 1. Protect oppressed women who escape marriage. 2. Speed up the establishment of agricultural and industrial women's schools. 3. Speed up the establishment of children's foster homes. 4. Abolish prostitution. 5. Speed up the establishment of women's crafts so that they can seek economic independence. 6. Formulate women's labor laws based on the principle of equal pay for equal work and protection of motherhood. 7. Oppose child brides. 8. Oppose the keeping of maids. 9. Protect child labor. 10. Break the etiquette of the slave nature of women.</p>
<h3>The Malay Dancer by Shi Duo</h3>
<p>Although we cannot see spacious and splendid dance halls in Malay folk life, we can hear delicate and sweet singing from deep within the green shade. This singing is the heartfelt melody that comes from the mouths of Malay dancers. Some of them make dancing and singing their livelihood, while others treat it as a part-time job, only coming out when they have free time from farming. These dancers are sometimes middle-aged women, sometimes girls of sixteen. Except for a few young girls, most of them are married women. Generally, in a dance troupe, besides one or two dancers, there are also several drummers and one or two clowns, a group of seven or eight people, singing everywhere. When business becomes slow in this city, they move to another city. Their whereabouts are uncertain.</p>
<p>In the evening, they come out in full dress and begin to dance and sing. Under the green trees, they set up a grass shed with four wooden poles, and spread straw mats on the ground. They dance on the straw mats, singing and interspersing with the strange noises of the clowns. Sometimes gentle, sometimes strong, it really makes people burst into laughter. When a customer wants to patronize them, they throw a handkerchief or other light object into the performance area. Soon, the clown leads the dancer to the customer. The dancer's feet originally have copper bells, so when she walks, they make a "jing zha jing zha" sound. Naturally, a crowd of viewers, big and small, follows this sound.</p>
<p>When the dancer reaches the customer, she naturally has a set of social etiquette. Then, she clears her throat and sings a captivating clear song. After singing, the customer gives payment, and with a smile, she returns to the performance area, waiting for the second customer to patronize her. Going back and forth like this, they finish their performance and return home to rest at midnight, preparing for the next day's work. Such a life is so leisurely and peaceful.</p>
<h3>Her Anti-Smoking Edict by Ke</h3>
<p>The wind is gentle and the sun is warm, and everything on the earth is filled with the spirit of spring. The withered poplars and grasses in the schoolyard are also sprouting and growing, full of a thriving attitude. The school gate is even more lively and interesting. Rickshaws, carriages, and cars are constantly coming and going, a veritable stream of carriages and horses, a beautiful sight to behold. He or she, each carrying boxes, bedding, baskets, and briefcases, their faces filled with smiles. Greetings and handshakes all express their intense happiness at reuniting after a brief separation. She, who had not returned home for the winter vacation and had long been lonely, finally looked forward to the start of school. Seeing this lively scene, she couldn't help but run around and wander about. In the classrooms, in the corridors, or in a house that was not often noticed or visited, she could see him and her, whispering sweet nothings to each other, even more intimate than usual. She held a cold and stern</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>attitude, and went to places where the price was high.</p>
<p>"Mo, where are you going alone? Our good friends Miss Zhou and Miss Yi have come. Let's go see them," Qian said, taking her hand and walking away. Turning a corner in the corridor, they heard the laughter of Miss Zhou, Miss Yi, and several other classmates coming from a lounge. She and Qian walked in, and everyone greeted them with smiles. There were five people sitting in the room: Zhou and Yi, Zhou's lover Mr. Cheng, Yi's lover Mr. Wang, and a male classmate named Chen.</p>
<p>"Qian, do you have cigarettes? Wang is craving them badly. Do a good deed and give him one to smoke," Cheng said, smiling at Yi.</p>
<p>"I don't smoke. Ask someone else," Qian hadn't finished speaking when Chen interrupted, "I have them, I have them!" He rummaged in his pocket and took out a cigarette case, handed it to Wang, who took one out, but Chen didn't smoke it himself, instead offering it to Cheng, saying, "I know you secretly smoked a cigarette this morning. Now your addiction is acting up again, but you don't dare say it, so you're using me as an excuse. I get dizzy just smelling cigarette smoke!" Cheng took the cigarette, threw it on the ground, stomped on it, and said with a laugh, "You little rascal, you're really good at talking! Wait till I take care of you!" He ran over and pressed Wang's head down until they were almost kissing, and Wang laughed so hard he couldn't breathe, stammering, "Please spare me! Miss Yi, please say something!" She</p>
<p>saw them making such a fuss over a cigarette, and couldn't help but</p>
<p>ask Qian in surprise,</p>
<p>"Cheng and Wang usually love to smoke. Why do they seem to hate cigarettes now?"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't you know? Because Yi and Zhou don't like cigarette smoking, they issued a smoking ban, so the two of them don't smoke now. But they each don't want to admit it themselves, so they have to tease and provoke each other to ask for it."</p>
<p>"Ah, according to Qian, any government smoking bans or group anti-smoking campaigns are not as effective as such obedience to orders! If every 'he' and 'she' in all of China were like Yi and Zhou, and issued a smoking ban to 'her,' then the future of smoking cessation in China would be very optimistic, and we wouldn't need those official platitudes," Chen said with a laugh. Wang and Cheng felt a little embarrassed to be exposed, while Zhou and Yi smiled serenely, expressing the infinite joy in their hearts.</p>
