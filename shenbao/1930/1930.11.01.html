<p>時評</p>
<h3>英保守黨大會</h3>
<p>大抵與人競爭而内部不能一致或現分裂之象者其結果必敗大而言之如歐洲大戰時其所以失敗之國大抵爲其國内之革命小而言之無論若何團體其團體中有内訌者終必爲其他團體所屈服世界之有識者類能知之故欲與人競爭必先自檢其内部是否一致即不一致是否信從之人屬諸多數苟多數也然後放手爲之苟不多數也母寗先自放棄何也在競爭之中而内部或生内訌者决無倖勝故也</p>
<p>此次英國保守黨之開秘密大會以定黨魁之去留即此意也此定黨魁去留之大會即保守黨黨魁包爾温自召集之其召集之者非欲謀黨魁之蟬聯也亦非爲黨魁之恐人推翻而爲是測　也蓋名雖爲黨魁而一經與他黨競爭而黨人不滿意者多至生携○也及至開會之後雖不能全會一致而以全數六百人中以四百六十人對一百十六人之多數而仍爲黨魁則亦未始不可謂包爾温之成功也</p>

<h3>華東四大學排球賽第一日</h3>
<p>華東體育會本由金陵東吳滬江之江四大學組織年於春秋兩季必舉行各種錦標比賽本季排球比赛輪在蘇州東吳大學舉行昨爲比賽之第一日經過詳情爰記如次</p>
<h3>排球錦標之過去</h3>
<p>四大歷次比赛之江以一度停頓故絶少如入歷次排球錦標更無染指機會滬江於全能籃球雄霸華東排球則歷爲東吳金陵所爭據上届錦標則仍屬東吳緣有東吳長子鐵閂陳福瑜之努力也現陳巳卒業離校新生李永錫周百嘉雖在校成績卓然卒以未合華東規則不能加入故本届錦標以金陵陳綫整齊較有奪標之望</p>
<h3>之江勝東吳</h3>
<p>四大排球賽取淘汰制秩序排定爲東吳對之江滬江對金陵第二日則由二組之勝者决賽之昨日（卅一）下午一時半起賽第一場對壘者爲東吳與之江裁判員徐紹武起賽之前東吳隊員及觀衆皆爲之江危緣之江旣少練習頭角未露而東吳則爲上届錦標隊也庸之交鋒之初東吳發球即爲閂門未能越過反之即得二分東吳至此大爲奮發然上一局竟以十九對二十一受挫第二局開始之江殺敵更烈東吳方面每多因夏楚章接球呆遲而失球者是役又以十九對二十一失敗</p>
<h3>金陵滬江未終場</h3>
<p>第二局由許氏輝爲裁判係金陵對滬江開始時巳細雨迷濛繼竟滂沱大雨時觀衆因球員並不停攻而興趣益濃第一局結果金陵以二十一對十五勝滬江第二局正擬開始滬江表示反對未曾　局觀衆遂因此大殺風景也</p>
<h3>之江犯規滬江棄權</h3>
<p>至此東吳指導員許民輝等即舉行指導會議結果滬江因今日（一日）上海尚有足球賽棄權之江於初賽中雖勝東吳因有中學生雜入於該會章程不合故之江對東吳改友誼賽因此錦標隊之决賽僅由東吳金陵兩隊取决而尤以金陵爲有希望惟今日（一日）如何大雨則將改期云</p>

<p>申報會國工商會議特刋第一號</p>
<h3>工商會議今日開幕</h3>
<p>八時會員謁靈丨十時在京勵志社行禮</p>
<p>提案四百餘件丨昨晚會員巳到百餘人</p>
<p>國民政府工商部召集之全國工商會議籌備業巳三月茲於今日在京勵志社行開幕禮會期八日集全國政府工商及領袖與專家共同討論國盛舉茲錄昨日情形錄下</p>
<h3>引言崇淦</h3>
<p>現在軍事即將結束努力建設事業履行民生主義實不容稍緩工商部爲厲行工商政策促進生產事業發展對外貿易增益國民經濟起見召集全國工商會議誠爲今日緊要之圖集二百餘政工商領袖及專家會於一堂討論國計民生問題爲空前之盛舉我安得不爲國家前途賀但記者於大會開幕之日有不能巳於言者略述於下</p>
<p>一開大會接到議案己有四百餘件之多對於工商問題無不重要但大會宜擇現在最重要而能實行者先加討論研究辦法當知目下中國工商之不發達有各種障碍並不祗在工商業之本身且討論之時對於二十類提案須有全部之觀察俾知互相關係之處於議决案件後亦應討論各案施行步驟使政府易於採納</p>
<p>二此次會員參加會議責任頗大全國期望亦甚殷應以全力討論提案宜少參加宴會日前會員在滬開談話會曾有人提議會員當少應酬而多討論意至善也實緣參與會議者每以酬酢爲苦而對於各機關招待之盛意又不可負耳</p>
<p>三工商部召集會議全國無不欣喜深望政府對於大會議决案儘量採納施行發展工商而利民生幸勿祗有空言而無實惠也</p>
<h3>對於工商會議之希望潘序倫</h3>
<p>此次國民政府爲振興實業解决民生起見特由工商部召開工商會議集全國工商行政長官工商界領袖及工商專家於一堂集思廣益收效必宏凡屬國人當無不希望斯會爲國民生計問題謀一澈底解决辦法序倫不才忝預議席對於斯會希望尤切因就國民普通心理爲工商會議進一言焉</p>
<p>我國承改革之餘二十年來迄無寗歲工商事業不僅未能按程發展反日呈萎頽不振之象此無可諱言者茲値軍事吿終建設伊始政府方面對於工商應如何提倡保護人民方面對於工商應如何努力進行方足以使全國實業日漸欣榮國民生計日臻富裕此中應行舉辦之事眞所謂萬緒千頭不遑枚舉故此次會議各項提案多至四百餘件細加察閲實無一非今日救濟提倡必要之圖凡我國人誰不祝望其一一通過一一實行雖然希望之趨身向無垠而事實之境域有限　如光線進行可無止境而輙爲四周實物所阻至不能出於一室故吾人在此次會議之中第一須認清目前政府及人民之能力不爲好高務遠之談一切討論須先以事實上爲可以達到目的之希望者爲主否則徒事空論何裨實益第二須認清目前救濟國内實業最切要之點將各項議案　繁就簡　領提綱併成數項主要議案以備政府採擇切實施行不可瑣細雜陳以致失去重心致無結果蓋全國工商會議之責任即在决定今後政府對於工商建設之主要方針其他枝葉案件亦可隨同解决</p>
<p>以序倫愚見所及此次數百提案如用歸納方法爲之區分大概不出三類即提倡國貨生產問題减免苛捐重税問題解决勞資糾紛問題是也惟再加歸納則减免苛捐重税解决勞資糾紛即係提倡國貨生產之唯一途徑故此次會議其主要議案可謂僅此二件茲再分析言之</p>
<p>我國捐税之重從工商業之擔負能力上論之可謂甲於天下近來工商業之不能發達多因遭受捐税摧殘之故减免之舉誠不可緩然反視政府財政狀况竭　如斯舉債且不遑焉能將應收歲入大爲减削故減免税捐諸案在原則上會中通過自無問題惟恐未必能於最短期内希望政府一一切實施行以前財政部歷次召集經濟會議財政會議裁厘會議成效若何足資證明此非序倫在工商會議開幕之先而故作此倒興之談誠因事實如此無可諱言者耳</p>
<p>然則吾人對於此次工商會議之唯一主要希望祗有解决勞資糾紛一案數年以來全國工商業在繼續不斷之勞資糾紛之下日益衰落可知糾紛繼續進行即足以斷絶國民生計倘不加以解决工商各業實無生存之可能但解决勞資糾紛在政府能力上爲可以實行之舉祇望工商會議對於增進工作效率防止勞資兩方過分要求以及提倡勞資分配盈利各點細加討論請求政府切實施行則不僅現存工商各業不致日漸　折停息中外資主亦將業於投資而工人資主兩方經濟亦將日漸寛裕深願同會諸公對此問題特别努力以期有所解决則此會之集爲不虚矣</p>

<h3>上海機聯會提案理由書</h3>
<p>上海機製國貨工廠聯合會於此次工商部召集工商會議提議機製洋式貨物豁免一切税厘並發　原料税以維國貨一案巳見二十三日本報茲補具理由書一份遞京如下</p>
<p>（一）機械管理人工造成大量生產比較　劣之理由　　近世工業均主大量產以維持事業開歐美工廠利用機械減少人工職是故耳最近國際勞工團體與企業家盛倡實業合理化以救濟現代勞工怒潮不亦促進實業維持社會安寗之良策乎美國如亨利福特製造廠不但其工廠消費小而效益大其唯一驚人之工作即爲機器管理人工不是人工管理機械全世界出貨最多人工最省成本最廉之汽車公司首推亨利福特爲第一其他工業亦漸採此制以與世界過剩之生產竸爭美國人民生活富庶每一事業創設均厚集資本著手營業一經公佈社會則股欵朝募而夕齊矣由前之説則工廠設立較易巳成之工廠亦改進較易矣反觀吾國機械不精人力浪費資金薄弱改進諸多困難者不可同日而語此應請豁免一切税厘以維吾國生產事業者理由一</p>
<p>（二）廢除税厘造成分工合作以與世界工業竸爭之理由東方之日本爲步武歐美厲行工商保護政策採用新政巳收良效之新興國家自明治維新以來日本出業出口日見增多舶來物品因受税則限制漸見减少國家對於生產事業奬勵保護之不暇故日本人民生活雖未能若歐美人之富庶但因豁免一切税厘之故彼國人民在國仙可以自由製造自由銷售工業界鑒於世界潮流均以大量生產占工業上優越地位遂利甲政府保護政策提倡分工合作俾得技術精而浪費少藉减低其成本形成連鎖式之大量生產以與世界角逐試觀歐戰時各國因應付戰事工業停頓鼓吹文化宣傳戰事用之紙張均由日本供給足徵連鎖式之大量生產不唯能救濟世界市場之恐慌亦能抵抗大量生產之侵略以促成其工業立國之基我國情形正與日本相似欲挽巳失之利權冀角逐於世界市場非政府保護政策之力不爲功應請豁免一切税厘以維吾國生產事業者其理由二</p>
<p>（三）廢除不良税制並不影響於政費之理由説者謂如若豁免一切税厘則政費無所出矣今試舉列强中之英國爲例然英國係不毛之地也旣乏農產又乏工業製造品其商業可無論矣詎知適得其反英政府努於商業之發展厘訂商業法規以免除紛爭以立商業上之信用豁免一切税厘以開拓其商業不論國内或國外之殖民地均闢爲自由港埠短期間内均有長足之進步世界各國實無與倫比故直接國家雖無棁收可徵間接徵得之税國家亦不在少數兩相比較實有過之而無不及然未聞英國因豁免一切税厘而絀於政費也由此以觀豁免一切税厘實於國家税收未損毫未而實有利於吾國民者也此應請豁免一切税厘以維吾國生產事業者其理由三</p>
<p>（四）陜棉税重洋棉税輕致陜棉阻滯應廢除税厘之理由民國以還戰亂頻仍省自爲政横征暴歛時有所聞以致商旅喪足商貨阻滯商民蹙額相吿曰捐税之繁重實較遜清變本加厲凡有血氣誰不義憤塡胸思有以救濟之首今也戰事吿終和平在望統一可期工商會議適於此時開幕畸形之税制或於此會有以解决否則長此因循不數十年中國不蹈於淪亡者幾希今試舉一例以證之陜西棉採用洋棉種栽成其織維之長拉力之强不亞於美棉價格亦與次等美棉相　今因捐税之重國人舍陜棉而用洋棉不亦痛哉茲將全國紗廠聯合會紡織時報調查所得陜棉每担所負之税銀自陜西至鄭州巳有九元之巨由鄭而漢而滬尚不計及按之需棉實况該棉之用途當以滬埠爲大宗若重重納税節節抽厘則陜棉之價格較之印棉與美棉相去其遠故滬廠寗使採用美棉而不用陜棉茲錄其税銀每担之分析如下「陜西厘金」每擔一元「陜州棉税」每擔七角「陜西敎育捐」每擔八角「陜州厘金」每擔八角「潼關棉税」每擔一元「陜州保衛捐」每擔一元「潼關常關税」每擔八角「陜州軍事附捐」每擔八角「潼關商税」每擔三角「陜州特别費」每擔一元五角「潼關警捐」每擔三角合計每擔銀元九元正</p>
<p>由此以觀欲求農產品之流通市　工業品之到處發展國貨商市之振興舍免除捐税其首未由此應請豁免一切税厘以維吾國生產事業以謀國貨之進展也</p>

<p>法醫往騐尸所檢騐　辦理至今巳歷數月不無成效故宣氏遺骸仍由某法醫偕徐檢察官蒞所依法檢騐徐君是日於該法醫在檢騐室着手剖騐時先傳人證至案訊問乃審訊將及終結而該法醫之檢騐報吿猶未送案經飭役往詢始具一報吿書路謂騐得死者頸部有手扼痕膚現血色腹内之心肝胃俱有紫血塊當係被人先將死者推於床上用布勒其頸部使</p>
<p>不能透氣窒塞而死　云云徐檢察官據該法醫報吿後遂諭令尸屬具結領尸棺殮而工部局則根據該報吿對錢阿才提起控訴援刑法二百八十四條請治被吿以豫謀殺人罪應處死刑此案由刑庭推事馮世德審理經馮推事迭次開庭傅集人證提到被吿研訊並由雙方律師辯論終結祇候宣判嗣馮推事因詳核</p>
<p>全案情節覺有可疑　之點認爲尚須調查證據再開辯論在此時問詎原辦之某法醫突又以一紙檢騐報吿書進該報吿之内容與其前具之報吿措詞完全不同大致謂騐得死者腹内之心肝胃並無紫血亦無積食惟檢查心腸胃有嗎啡百分之二十五而雅片成分極大</p>
<p>致死原因當係服毒　云云尤可異者此報吿書乃工部局化騐西醫華格爾氏所簽署馮推事得此報吿後大爲注意亟定期通知兩造律師傅集人證重開辯論及至言詞辯論終結馮推事始當庭將第二次之檢騐報吿書發交起訴人捕房代理律師張天蔭閲看並詢張律師在工部局曾否見此報吿蓋向例工部局西醫每檢騐一尸骸</p>
<p>須備具報吿書兩紙　一呈法院存悉一送工部局之承辦捕房保存以便稽查當時張律師見詢因此報吿初未寓目故請將案展期俾回捕房調查馮君即准所請延期至十月廿九日開庭續審而第二次之報吿亦經張律師查明緣是日退庭後張回至工部局法律組及承辦該案之匯山捕房查詢皆以未見該報吿對旋赴簽署報吿之華格爾醫生處詳詢一切經華氏吿以渠之檢騐該尸係受法院某法醫之囑託故於檢騐竣事應特繕具報吿給於某法醫因非工部局囑渠檢騐渠不須再給報吿於工部局也於是</p>
<p>始恍然於檢騐之日　某法醫檢騐良久未能斷定致死原因而其報吿原欲俟華氏騐明始具但華氏則以化騐需時某法醫迫不及待遂以彼之檢騐所得具一報吿以資塞責致有此誤馮推事旣將案情審查明白即於廿九日宣吿判决</p>
<p>錢阿才無罪應釋放　至某法醫復於重開辯論由捕房律師請求展期之時間内特行補正手續再作第三次之檢騐報吿書一紙論死者確係服毒但於服毒之後跌仆床上胸脯觸於床沿以致氣窒身死云</p>

<h3>醫學界反對飛機</h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>自飛機發明後人類交通日益便捷科學貢獻於人類之偉大殊爲世界萬民所共同欽佩者矣然而據最近西方之名人對於飛機反對甚烈殊足異矣</p>
<p>醫學界中人以爲飛機事業之發展關於傳染病預防之方法即將破壞無餘譬如東方这瘟疫與虎烈拉西方各國向無之近代因世界交通之便捷此病遂傳染於全世界矣各國海岸爲預防計常有在進口船隻中加以嚴重之檢查者拒病者之登岸冀以抵制此種病症施行以來頗具成效良以人之得有上述兩種病菌之一者由東方上船以至歐美途中勾留之日旣多病象遂顯然可見决不能逃檢查者之目然而至今飛機事業日益發達將來世界交通均仰仗於飛機東西交通數日之間即可到達身得病菌者不及發長即可遠至他處以傳染於他人檢騐旅客雖嚴雖無功今後之疾病預防恐將完全破產殊足悲矣</p>
<p>又尚有身帶病菌之蚊蠅向爲歐美所無者今後飛機交通實行之後蚊蠅即可緣機以推廣其勢力範圍人類身體之安全益覺有不可設想者矣</p>
<p>基於上述理由故歐美醫學界中頗有竭力反對飛機之應用者然飛機爲今後交通唯一之利器醫學家此種論調其亦不免有因噎廢食之誚歟</p>

<h3>十底之特殊銀洋忙狀</h3>
<p>市場概况　昨値十月底金融界唯一之大比期其各種收解之繁忙狀態每年除四底及年底而外無出其在銀行方面更有大宗結欵自覺格外加忙查此届長期歸束數額據業中人估量不下一萬餘萬爲上届所不及蓋從前轉賬者多此次轉賬者少宜其有此現象也</p>
<p>厘拆價格（洋厘）早市爲七錢二分六厘二毫半午市爲七錢二分六厘半結果較前日午市改小八毫七怱半緣前日公債交割餘額甚多致頭襯充斥市價遂趨下游也（銀拆）早市五分午市四分較前日又跌三四分劃頭仍爲白劃銀行掛牌無市</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋早市爲六錢四分較前日又跌一厘因此項交易現在甚爲簡單故市氣甚疲做出交易僅早市三千五百角廣東小洋亦趨下勢早市爲六錢三分六厘午市爲六錢三分五厘七毫半結果較前日午市跌去一厘半做出交易早市十二萬五千角午市六萬五千角銅元爲三百九十千文</p>
<p>銀洋進出（銀欵）昨日銀錢業各種由解數額孔多一時疏理較遲屬稿時方在整理中故確數無從採訪據業中人推測銀行方面一應收解不下數千萬而僅就結欵一項計有一千餘萬云（洋欵）匯劃票欵早市做出一百四十四萬五千午市做出八十二萬鈔票祗午市三萬五千塲外鈔票早市二十一萬五千午市十一萬五千銀行交易早市互市三十七萬午市五十萬各銀行及錢莊收解各種洋欵均從略</p>
<h3>長期息價内盤巳開出</h3>
<p>錢莊對存欵長期之息價向例有内盤行情之名稱須由各同業共同討論查今届拆息方面雖較平直而内容銀根頗有嫌多嫌少大相懸殊之苦故存欵長期之息價照理勢而論應須較上届（即四月底）稍小但存户方面似嫌不滿現巳</p>
<p>議决准較上届改昂二錢半爲五兩二錢半聞存額達四千餘萬云</p>
<h3>上月份之存息底盤</h3>
<p>（十月份）銀拆上錢之日甚少故全月統計不過二兩三錢六分平均每天扯價不過七分八厘餘其中有一日及十日兩天休業如是能扯到二兩半存息之底盤故預料明日常會提議存息案總在二兩五錢九五扣云</p>

<h3>外江人與廣東人</h3>
<p>— 訓</p>
<p>在任何一個學校裏常可以聽到「廣東人」及和「外江人」的二個名詞尤其在我們學校裏「他是廣東人」或「他是外江人」的聲調很容易進你的耳朶裏只要你能在我們學校裏宿舍内運動塲中走兩個圈的話</p>
<p>「廣東人」就是指廣東的人這是不必解釋的「外江人」是指我們國裏浩浩蕩蕩的揚子江左近或以北的幾省的人在上海這號爲黃金地的地方商業繁盛人口衆多因之學校也多到算個不清爲什麽特别的把這二個名詞常是在學校裏互唱着呢這個道理也很簡單就是這二種民性太不相同的緣故罷了</p>
<p>廣東人之富有反抗性冒險性堅勇性的話這是太多數人都成認的了只要把沿海七省爲什麽跑到南洋羣島去經商的都只有廣東福建兩省的人的問題一想便明白的就因其富有以上的性格把「廣東人」這個名詞與幾省相連如成的「外江人」的名詞相對着這相對着的名詞便常充滿在學校的空氣裏</p>
<p>兹舉幾點較爲大的不同點說說</p>
<p>在衛生方面說來就洗澡一件事情在廣東人寒冷的天氣裏一禮拜至少也有三四次至澡室裏去洗澡在天熱的時候那一天一次的洗澡當不必說而一天二三次的也多着然而外江人呢在天氣冷時他們簡直不知道有洗澡的一回事而在炎熱的暑假中也許有洗一二次罷（也許有的是例外然總在少數是無疑的）這裏有一段有趣的話是二位外江同學親口對我說的很有以表現着外江人的特性第一次在天寒冷天氣的時候我與一位本地同學同房因此我們時常關於開窗洗澡的事都是討論的在使那位同學也能和我們一様的多洗澡多喜歡開窗然所得到的結果他只有說說「你們（指我們廣東人）這様喜歡開窗洗澡的緣故是因爲廣東臨海與外國人往來密切所以廣東人都像外國人一様了」還有一次也在冬天的時候我在勸一位四川的同學去洗澡但他答覆我說「廣東人身上帶一種臭氣故喜歡洗澡我們是没有臭氣所以不必」唉像這様的話竟由所謂受着高等敎育的學生口裏端裝嚴正的說出口來正是要對中國敎育發生一個大疑問</p>
<p>其餘像穿着棉袍長衫棉袍套褲打球總還算開通一點的知道了運動二個字然而竟有對於運動爲可恥的有看見唱歌跳舞爲奇事的有緊閉着窗戶在房内吐霧吞雲吸香烟的把整個斗室似的房内弄得咫尺不見事物有在洗面間的公共水池中用着底黏痰穢的面盆去握水的有隨地吐痰而還以爲得計的有毫無事體而忽聽到一句廣東口語說的「打」便面青鼻黃俯頭縮腦的怕起來逃的種種情形實不能一言而盡換言之現代民族潮浪激放的時候如一般外江人也者仍是欲學左手摇白扇右手掀鬍鬚的清談起來成日以課本書錄拿着咬文嚼字的爛誦對於一切潮流浪痕全若在雲霧圈道裏像這様能夠把中國民族激發起來麽像這様能夠希望中國也能在國際舞台上做個出色的主演者是可能的麽唉外江人乎我們跟上潮流去罷不要再做清夢了</p>

<h3>Making Business Everyone's Responsibility (Natural)</h3>
<p>When Mr. Wang Yunwu lectured on industrial and commercial management, he said that a business deal is done directly by three people, and the profit seems to be the result of the efforts of these three. However, one should not forget the person who greets the guests and manages miscellaneous affairs. Because of the success of this business deal, he also accounts for a quarter of the strength. If he did not greet guests and manage miscellaneous affairs, or if he was not responsible and neglected the guests, how could these three people succeed? Mr. Zhang Gongquan put it well: When we enter the bank, we are learning business; when we are in the bank, we are doing business. Those who receive deposits and remit money are doing business, and those who manage cashiers and accountants are also doing business. Even those who manage investigation and research are doing business. Why? Because the person who receives deposits can pay attention to the situation of deposits and withdrawals. If others want to withdraw money to remit money, they should guide them on how to remit money. If others want to invest, they can tell them how the bank can invest for them. Those who pay remittances, if they know that the remittance is for monthly household expenses, can guide them to save money. If the cashier can handle receipts and payments quickly and kindly, he can indirectly attract more depositors. The accountant, when recording accounts, can pay attention to the origin and destination of each item. If he thinks that new business can be generated, he should tell the personnel in charge of business and let them pay attention to investigation and research. It goes without saying that new business arises from investigation and research is of great importance to customers and business. Even managing general affairs, if he can organize and clean up the industry property to increase customers' favor, and manage the conduct of business effectively to save expenses for the industry, he is also doing business for the industry. In short, no one in the bank can be separated from the word "business". Everyone should treat it as doing business. Everyone should understand that doing business is everyone's responsibility.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>British Conservative Party Congress</h3>
<p>Generally, those who compete with others but cannot be internally united or show signs of division are bound to fail in the end. On a large scale, the countries that failed during the European War were mostly due to internal revolutions. On a small scale, no matter what kind of group, if there is internal strife in the group, it will eventually be subdued by other groups. Those who are knowledgeable in the world can know this. Therefore, if you want to compete with others, you must first examine whether your internal affairs are consistent. If they are not consistent, whether the people who believe and follow belong to the majority. If it is the majority, then let go and do it. If it is not the majority, then it is better to give up first. Why? Because there is no chance of winning if there is internal strife during the competition.</p>
<p>The British Conservative Party's secret congress to decide whether to keep or remove the party leader is for this reason. This congress to decide whether to keep or remove the party leader was convened by the Conservative Party leader, Baldwin, himself. He convened it not to seek the re-election of the party leader, nor to fear that others would overthrow the party leader, but to test public opinion. Although he is nominally the party leader, if the party members are dissatisfied after competing with other parties, many will become dissidents. After the meeting, although it was not unanimous, with a majority of 460 people out of the total number of 600 people against 116 people, he is still the party leader, so it cannot be said that Baldwin's success.</p>

<h3>Xie and Zou Leave Taiyuan for Tianjin</h3>

<p>Women Commit Suicide to Eliminate Concerns about the Future</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo, 31st - According to news from Taipei, the aborigines only attack the Japanese and do not harm the Taiwanese, so the police suspect that the Taiwanese are secretly instigating the aborigines to rebel. Several suspects have now been arrested. The Japanese government has ordered the Governor-General of Taiwan to investigate the cause of the rebellion and report it as soon as possible. Japanese infantry will attack the aborigines this morning with the help of machine guns and airplanes. The aborigines know that they are in a desperate situation and plan to fight to the death. It is said that many women commit suicide to eliminate the concerns of the men who go to war.

<p>Four Dead and Two Injured</p>
<p>Reuters Polozhe, 30th - The British Imperial Airways airplane, Washington City, crashed here at 2:30 pm today on its return flight from India and was completely destroyed. Workers in the field rushed to the rescue and dragged out five people, all of whom were seriously injured. They were immediately sent to the hospital. Before long, four people died from their injuries. The sixth person in the airplane, named Tompkin, had a serious leg injury and still walked to the roadside to call for help from the villagers. Another telegram said that the airplane crash was due to engine damage. The driver, named Flynn, intended to find a suitable landing place near the coast, but there was fog. According to witnesses, the airplane was blown by strong winds at a height of 100 　 and touched the mountainside, and the airplane was completely destroyed, but it did not catch fire. The two mechanics were killed. One of the passengers was a beauty named Sterly, who also died. There were two other passengers, both British, one named Bosworth and one named Tompkin, both of whom were injured. Tompkin's leg had been amputated after being admitted to the hospital.</p>

<h3>Detailed Account of the British Airship R-101 Disaster in France</h3>
<p>On the night of October 4th, at 2:00 AM, a shocking tragedy occurred near the village of Allonne, four kilometers south of Beauvais, France, causing a worldwide sensation. The event that deserves special mention in the history of human evolution and the advancement of aeronautics is the crash and burning of the British airship R-101.</p>
<p>The R-101 airship departed from the Cardington Aerodrome at 6:30 PM on the afternoon of the 4th, presumably heading to India via the French Mediterranean and North Africa. Unexpectedly, it crashed and was destroyed upon reaching French territory. Out of the total of fifty-eight passengers and crew members, only six survived. The rest were burned beyond recognition, reduced to charred remains. British Air Minister Thomson and Civil Aviation Director-General Brancker both perished in the disaster. A detailed account of the ship's structure and the circumstances before and after the accident is provided below.</p>
<p>(1) Structure of the R-101</p>
<p>The R-101 airship was constructed with British government funding, involving several years of work and enormous expenses. It was finally completed on October 12th of last year. The total volume of the ship was 141,500 cubic meters, with a total length of 223 meters and a main rib length of 40 meters. Inside the ship, the passenger area included a lounge of 18 meters long and 9 meters wide, a dining room capable of accommodating 50 people, a smoking room, and over twenty bedrooms equipped with two beds each. Corridors lined with green glass panels to allow light in ran along both sides of the ship, allowing passengers to enjoy the outside scenery. The interior of the airship was no different from the interior of the most modern seagoing vessel. The lounge was furnished with comfortable chairs, coffee tables, and writing desks. The height of the rooms was very suitable, allowing people to move around without feeling cramped. The dining room also had green glass panel walls to let in light. The kitchen was located below the dining room, with a small elevator for waiters to bring food up and down. The smoking room, kitchen, and radio room were all located at the top of the ship and were completely isolated from other rooms using the latest ventilation methods. All cooking was done electrically. All kinds of utensils in the ship were made of the lightest metal because the load capacity of the airship was limited, so everything had to be carefully calculated. The ship's facilities for passengers were extremely thorough. When it was cold, there were hot water pipes for heating; when it was hot, there were ventilators for ventilation. Passengers could adjust the room temperature at will. The ship's engine did not use ordinary gasoline, but Mazont (a combustible material distilled from gasoline). Unfortunately, the original minimum weight estimate could not be achieved. As a result, the weight of the fuel carried by the ship increased by eight and a half tons, and the other useful items that were planned to be loaded were reduced by eight and a half tons. Moreover, the engine only had 586 to 650 horsepower, far short of the 750 horsepower hoped for this year, greatly affecting the ship's maneuverability. In addition, one of the five engines had to be placed at the rear for steering, so only four engines were dedicated to propelling the airship. The main ribs of the R-101 were all made of steel, which was the first time that steel was used so extensively in aviation manufacturing. These steel bones were all made into tubular shapes with extremely strong bending resistance. The airship was very heavy, but when it floated in the air, it could be brought close to the mooring mast with the strength of twelve people. However, when it was pushed out of the storage yard, it took the strength of four hundred people. The R-101's test flight on October 12th of last year was excellent. It took only one and a half hours to push it out of the storage yard, take off into the air, and bring it close to the mooring mast again, without any accidents. The first time it stayed in the air for 48 hours. At 11:20 AM on the 14th of the same month, the R-101 initially carried 52 passengers on a five-hour voyage in the London area, averaging 58 miles per hour. At that time, only three engines were used, and the ship's maneuverability was only 500 horsepower. The results of the trial voyage never made people expect this accident to happen.

<h3>Secret Meeting of the British Conservative Party</h3>
<p>Baldwin States Financial Policy</p>
<p>Receives Unanimous Support from the Audience</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th – The Conservative Party held a secret meeting today, convened by party leader Baldwin, with the aim of obtaining support from party members for his policies. Attendees included 600 Conservative members of both the House of Lords and the House of Commons. After Baldwin stated his policies, all attendees except for Beaverbrook raised their hands in agreement. Baldwin stated that without levying tariffs on foreign goods, it would be impossible to cope with the current state of British industry. He stated that when he regains power, he will immediately introduce a tariff. Regarding the Imperial Conference, he advocated for preferential tariffs proposed by the prime ministers of the self-governing dominions and expressed his willingness to have a free hand in dealing with other countries. He believed that no Conservative leader could change this approach. His financial policy can be regarded as a policy of a free hand. When someone urged him to resign as party leader, he happily agreed to step down and no longer participate in politics, but if the party still wanted him as leader, he wished to receive more loyal support than in the past few months. After Baldwin finished speaking, he left the meeting amidst applause from the crowd. The crowd later passed a motion of 460 votes to 116 to retain Baldwin as party leader. At the adjournment, a motion of confidence in Baldwin was unanimously passed.</p>

<h3>Preparatory Committee for Limiting the Manufacture of Narcotics</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th – A preparatory meeting was held today prior to the convening of the conference of narcotics manufacturing countries to limit the manufacture of narcotics.

<h3>German Metalworkers' Strike Successfully Resolved</h3>
<p>People's Hearts Are Greatly Relieved</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 31st – The head count vote of 132,000 German metalworkers on the reinstatement conditions accepted by the leaders of the metal merchants' association has been announced. Among them, 7,500 people advocated for resuming work immediately according to the conditions stipulated. Communist personnel claimed that the result of this vote was produced by improper procedures and planned to organize a new Red Metalworkers' Union to confront it, and predicted that all workers would enthusiastically contribute to joining this new union. Today, several factories have already resumed work, and the remaining factories can also start work uniformly before Monday. Several factories have partially resumed work, and the large-scale Siemens factory began work uniformly yesterday. After this ending, the people's hearts across the country were greatly relieved, believing that a new wage settlement method could be negotiated without strikes in the future. However, if the standard of living (including indirect and direct taxes) cannot be reduced to average with the wage reduction, then it is still not optimistic.</p>

<h3>National Government Approves Hebei Provincial Government to Move to Tianjin</h3>
<p>The National Government instructed the Executive Yuan on the 29th, stating that according to the report from Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the original establishment of the Hebei Provincial Government in Beiping and the placement of the provincial capital in the ancient capital was intended to be excellent. However, Tianjin is located at the intersection of the Beining and Jinpu Railways and is the confluence of various streams of the Baihe River, and is closer to the capital auxiliary area than Beiping. Historically, it has also been the area of the provincial capital. At a time when the current situation has not yet been settled, it seems appropriate to determine it as the center of governance for a province to facilitate control. It is proposed to consider the situation and approve the temporary relocation of the Hebei Provincial Government to Tianjin, and then re-approve it after the overall situation is completely settled. Regarding the Beiping area, there are the Municipal Government and the Pingjin Garrison Command governing the area, so there will be no impact on administrative security issues. This is reported for approval. In response, it should be approved and handled, and the Provincial Government should be ordered to comply and report.</p>
<h3>Architectural Layout of the Central Political District</h3>
<p>The Capital Construction Committee Actively Plans</p>
<p>Since the Capital Construction Committee was ordered by the National Government in February of this year to designate the Ming Palace as the central political district, it has been actively engaged in planning the architectural layout plans for the central government agencies. Furthermore, since the central government agencies have recently felt that their offices are narrow due to the development of affairs, and they have been planning to build houses. On the one hand, they are restricted by the National Government's order that they cannot build offices outside the political district. On the other hand, the committee has not yet made a decision plan, so they have high hopes for the completion of the architectural plan of the central political district. The committee also regards this as the primary task and is currently working hard on it. Successively, Consultant Schubaed of the Sun Committee drew detailed diagrams, which were submitted to the first plenary meeting of the committee in April, which resolved to hand them over to the Engineering Construction Group for joint research. The 26th Standing Committee Meeting decided on four principles: (1) Preserve all historical sites. (2) Build 40-meter-wide roads around the political district to match Zhongshan Road. (3) The main roads should be straight to achieve grandeur and solemnity. (4) The area of each section in the district is limited to 40 mu. The Engineering Group was ordered to comply. Subsequently, the group submitted a layout plan of the buildings in the central political district and proposed it to the 30th Standing Committee Meeting, which resolved to "compile and print the information on the progress of this case and all the diagrams and send them to the various yuan, ministries, and commissions to solicit opinions and request a written reply within two weeks." The Secretariat of the Committee then compiled and printed "The Progress of Planning the Architectural Plan of the Central Political District," with various diagrams attached, and sent them to various agencies for review and reply. Recently, it has been reported that various yuan, ministries, and commissions in the capital have sent their opinions to the committee, including the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Audit Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Examination Yuan, the Supreme Court, the Academia Sinica, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Personnel, the Ministry of the Navy, the Ministry of Health, the Training Directorate General, the General Staff Headquarters, the Huai River Regulation Committee, the Construction Committee, the Relief Committee, and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. In addition to compiling and classifying the various opinions and incorporating them into the agenda of the next Standing Committee Meeting, the committee has also sent letters urging the agencies that have not yet replied to send their opinions to the committee as soon as possible so that they can be submitted to the meeting for joint discussion. In the future, the original plan may be adopted, revised, or further refined according to the opinions of the various agencies, or experts in ancient Chinese architecture may be hired to plan the plan to make it perfect.</p>
<h3>Jinan Telephone Company's Japanese Debt Case</h3>
<p>The Court Actually Allows the Japanese to Enforce Provisional Attachment</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: The Jinan District Court ordered the Jinan Telephone Company to repay the loan of more than 600,000 Japanese yen owed by Ma Guanhe, the former general manager of the company, to the Japanese-owned Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha, and issued an order for provisional execution. At 9:00 AM early (29th), Li, the court clerk of the District Court, and Feng, the court bailiff, led three representatives of the company, Japanese nationals Yoshida Shin, Takahashi, and Fujimoto, to the telephone bureau to enforce the provisional attachment. They first inspected all the locations for a week and then asked the company for the general ledger. The company replied that the general ledger had been taken to Beiping by the chief accountant. The Japanese nationals then left the telephone bureau. The telephone bureau has appointed lawyer Song Heqing to first file a lawsuit with the court to revoke the provisional execution in order to avoid harming the company's business, and then appeal to the High Court. The loan should be the responsibility of Ma Guanhe personally, because although Ma was the general manager of the company at the time, he mortgaged the company's property to borrow the money, but the contract clearly stipulated that the debtor was Ma Guanhe, not the telephone company. Moreover, Ma had sent a letter to the board of directors of the telephone company stating that the company did not use the money and that he was solely responsible for it (the original letter stated: "Respectfully replying to the item recorded in today's board meeting resolution, the Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha mortgage loan. This matter was handled by me personally at that time. The company did not use the money and has nothing to do with the company and the directors. In the future, I will be solely responsible for the Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha litigation and settlement. I hereby reply to you for your information. Sincerely, Ma Guanhe, Jinan Telephone Company"). The telephone company has photocopied several copies of this letter and attached it to the pleadings and submitted it to various government offices. However, the court did not mention a word about this letter in its judgment. The most noteworthy thing is that all the workers of the company are shareholders and have invested their blood and sweat. Once the company belongs to the Japanese, all the workers will go bankrupt, so they are extremely angry about this matter. Han Fuju, the chairman of the provincial government, also paid great attention to this matter because it concerns national interests and the transportation of the entire city. He has sent a letter to the court to handle the case carefully. The key to this case is Ma Guanhe alone. Although Ma dares not appear in court because of the wanted warrant, it is said that Ma will never risk losing national interests and will publish an announcement in the newspapers in Pingjin within a few days stating that the money was borrowed by him personally and has nothing to do with the company. The following is a copy of the company's letter to the provincial and municipal governments and the Department of Agriculture and Mining: "Report for the unfair trial by the court and the destruction of the transportation business, requesting relief and protection. Since the company solicited shares in the fourth year of the Republic of China and was contracted by the former general manager Ma Guanhe, i.e., Ma Huijie, the debt managed for ten years reached 1.2 million yuan. In the spring of the fourteenth year, the company's board of directors resolved to dismiss him and hired accountant Xie Lin to investigate the various accounts. In addition to the machine price owed to the German-owned Siemens, the rest were loans from banks and stores in Jinan and Pingjin, and there were no interest-bearing loans from Japanese merchants. Unexpectedly, this year, the Japanese-owned Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha accused Ma Guanhe of borrowing 420,000 Japanese yen from the company during the management period, with interest totaling more than 600,000 Japanese yen, equivalent to more than 1 million Chinese yuan. The Jinan District Court ordered the company to repay it and announced a provisional execution. It was found that private electrical businesses cannot borrow foreign debts without government permission. The Regulations on the Prohibition of Electrical Businesses promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce long ago stipulated that Ma Guanhe's loan was not only without government permission, but the company's shareholders and directors were also unaware of it. After this case occurred, the company's directors questioned Ma Guanhe, and he personally wrote a letter stating that the money was used by him personally and would be repaid by him personally, which had nothing to do with the company. This time, the court did not summon Ma Guanhe and the old directors to inquire about the truth, but only relied on the one-sided statement of the Japanese to forcefully order the company to repay this debt. Although the company has stated its appeal, the court ignored it and carried out the provisional execution, which is illegal, arbitrary, and intentionally destroying the company. The transportation in Jinan City will inevitably stop, not only affecting the entire city, but also the company's property will be taken away by the Japanese. The debt tickets issued before will inevitably be unable to be repaid, which is not in line with the principle of fairness. Moreover, Ma Guanhe used to be the director of the Shandong Provincial Bank, the general manager of the Zhili Provincial Bank, and the director of the Zhili Finance Department, and was not without resources. He can be ordered to repay the debt. Why should he deliberately impose the disaster on the debt-ridden company? It is really confusing whether there are other effects in this. Forced to do nothing, we have to lay out the petitions and earnestly ask your government to review and transfer the letter to the court to revoke the provisional execution, and order Ma Guanhe to come to the case for cleaning up in order to maintain business and emphasize transportation. It is virtue and convenience."</p>
<p>Appendix: Original Judgment of Jinan District Court: Plaintiff: Masakazu Kagawa (General Manager of Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha), Right Agent: Takashi Yoshida (Japanese), Deputy Agent: Mou Shaozhou (Qingdao Lawyer), Defendant: Ma Guanhe (Former Manager of Jinan Telephone Company), Special Agent: Sun Er　(Lawyer), Defendant: Jinan Telephone Company, Right Agent: Song Zanying (Lawyer). The right party concerned filed a lawsuit due to debt litigation. The court ruled as follows: Main Text: The defendant is ordered to jointly repay the plaintiff's Japanese gold of 420,000 yuan, of which the interest on 20,000 Japanese gold is calculated at an annual interest rate of 17% from March 11th of the 13th year of the Republic of China until the end of the execution, and the interest on 220,000 Japanese gold is calculated at an annual interest rate of 12% from February 9th of the 13th year of the Republic of China until August 8th of the 15th year, and the annual interest rate is calculated at 14% from August 9th of the same year until the end of the execution, and the interest on 80,000 Japanese gold is calculated at an annual interest rate of 12% from April 11th of the 13th year of the Republic of China until October 10th of the 15th year (should deduct the paid interest of 7 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 fen), and the annual interest rate is calculated at 14% from October 11th of the same year until the end of the execution, of which the interest on 100,000 Japanese gold is calculated at an annual interest rate of 12% from November 4th of the 12th year of the Republic of China until November 3rd of the 15th year (should deduct the paid interest of 4,020 yuan, 7 jiao, and 2 fen), and the annual interest rate is calculated at 14% from November 4th of the same year until the end of the execution. The litigation costs of this provisional execution shall be borne by the defendant. According to the plaintiff's claim, the defendant Ma Guanhe, who was the manager of Jinan Telephone Company, borrowed 40,000 Japanese gold from the Qingdao branch of the plaintiff on March 23rd of the 10th year of the Republic of China for electric industry funds and land management funds. The annual interest rate is 15%, and March 10th and September 10th each year are the interest payment dates. If there is any delay in repaying the principal and interest on March 10th of the 11th year of the Republic of China, an additional interest of 2% will be added. There is a loan agreement stipulating the terms and conditions, and the Jinan Telephone Company is jointly responsible for the guarantee. At that time, it was registered in the Japanese Consulate in Jinan, and the defendant Ma Guanhe only repaid 20,000 Japanese gold successively on March 14th, November 30th of the 11th year, and March 10th of the 12th year after borrowing the money. On March 10th of the 13th year, only the interest was paid, and the remaining 20,000 yuan and the subsequent interest were not paid. It is also said that the defendant Ma Guanhe borrowed 400,000 Japanese gold from the Qingdao branch of the plaintiff on July 26th of the 10th year of the Republic of China due to the expansion of the Jinan Telephone Company's business and the purchase of machinery, etc., mortgaging land and machinery, etc. It was agreed that the loan would be borrowed in installments within three years, and the interest would be calculated from the date of each loan at an annual interest rate of 12%, and the interest would be paid once every six months. If there is any delay, an additional delay damage fee of 2% will be added from the next day of the delay until the date of repayment. At that time, there was a loan agreement stipulating the terms and conditions, and the Jinan Telephone Company was jointly responsible for it. The company's entire board of directors signed and sealed the agreement, and it was registered in the Japanese Consulate in Jinan. Later, 220,000 Japanese gold was delivered to the defendant on August 9th of the 10th year of the Republic of China, and the defendant only cleared the interest up to February 8th of the 13th year. After that, the remaining principal and interest were not paid. Also, 80,000 Japanese gold was delivered to the defendant on October 11th of the 10th year of the Republic of China, and the defendant only cleared the interest up to April 10th of the 13th year. After that, the remaining principal and interest were not paid. Also, 100,000 Japanese gold was delivered to the defendant on November 4th of the 10th year of the Republic of China, and the defendant only cleared the interest up to November 3rd of the 12th year. After that, the remaining principal and interest were not paid. Request to order the defendant Ma Guanhe and Jinan Telephone Company to jointly repay the principal and interest and request provisional execution. The court summoned the plaintiff's agent to testify to the various statements and submitted loan certificates and guarantee object certificates, recognition certificates, and other documents as evidence. The defendant Ma Guanhe's address is unknown, and it was served by public announcement. A special agent was selected to appear in court and replied that the plaintiff is a Japanese company. According to Chinese laws, it is registered but has not obtained legal person status, and has no litigation ability. It should be dismissed. It is also said that the defendant Ma Guanhe had direct behavior for the 40,000 yuan loan in the case, but for the other 400,000 yuan loan, it was borrowed for the telephone company's expansion of business and purchase of machinery. In fact, it was used by the telephone company. Although Ma Guanhe was the general manager at the time, he could only be responsible for cleaning up and could not be responsible for repayment. The defendant Jinan Telephone Company's agent appeared in court and replied that foreign merchants must register with the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce of China to obtain legal person status. The plaintiff has not registered and naturally cannot have legal person status or litigation ability. Furthermore, in terms of facts, when Ma Guanhe handed over the position of general manager of the telephone company, there was no above-mentioned loan. The loan certificates were all issued in the name of Ma Guanhe. According to commercial customs, the loan of a business must be issued in the name of the business, and there is no reason for the general manager to issue it in his personal name. His personal behavior cannot be the behavior of the business. The debt was borrowed in the name of Ma Guanhe, which is clearly a private loan and has nothing to do with the company. Although there are directors listed in the loan agreement, Ma Guanhe impersonated the signature, and the company was not aware of it. Since the company is not acting as a guarantor in the name of the company, the company cannot be responsible. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Robbery of the Wuhu-Datong Steamer Shenglong</h3>
<p>Wuhu Communication: The small steamers on the Wuhu-Datong route have been robbed several times in recent years. The military and police authorities have strictly pursued the case, but no progress has been made. Unexpectedly, on the 29th, the Shenglong small steamer of the Heji Company, which departed from Wuhu to Datong, suddenly discovered several bandits disguised as passengers on the Jiangmian of Bianxingzhou, more than 60 li away from Wuhu. They pulled out their pistols and fired a shot, forcing the captain to stop the ship. At that time, several bandit ships had already arrived at the Shenglong small steamer, and the bandits swarmed into the ship and searched the passengers, taking away 5,000 to 6,000 yuan in cash and all the passengers' valuables, and then escaped to the north bank of the river. After a little inventory, the Shenglong steamer still sailed to Datong. After hearing the report, the Wuhu Shipping Association specially presented a letter to the military and police authorities today, requesting that they be ordered to strictly pursue and handle the case in order to reassure the travelers.

<h3>Continued News on the Case of a Japanese National Beating a Passenger to Death</h3>
<p>Wuhu correspondence: On the 26th, the Ri Qing Company's Xiangyang Maru steamer, sailing from Hankou downstream, experienced a case of passenger Ding Changming being beaten to death. All circles here are extremely indignant at the barbarity and unreasonableness of the Japanese, and have petitioned the Party Headquarters for assistance. Zhao Jingshi, the Chief of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, also repeatedly negotiated with the Wuhu Japanese Consulate regarding the case involving human life. However, the Japanese side insisted that Ding Changming's death was due to a blockage of phlegm, and consistently refused to admit the beating. This further angered the masses. On the 30th, the Wuhu County Party Affairs Rectification Committee specially convened an emergency meeting of all circles, resolving to first send a letter to the local court requesting it to dispatch personnel to reopen the coffin for a second autopsy, with representatives from various agencies and organizations being dispatched to the scene to monitor and ensure thoroughness. At the same time, Zhang Bangchen, Ding Changming's nephew, was summoned to the Party Headquarters to inquire about everything, so as to strictly negotiate with the Japanese Consulate based on the facts, and to not stop until the goal of compensating the killer and the family is achieved. The murderer, Liu Decai, is still being held in the local court pending legal resolution. (30th)</p>

<h3>Zhu Jiahua Completes Handover Procedures</h3>
<p>Former Zhejiang Civil Affairs Director Zhu Jiahua served for three years, focusing on rectifying officialdom. A month ago, he submitted his resignation to take up the post of President of Zhongshan University in Guangzhou, which was approved. He ordered all departments to expedite the handover, which has now been completed. All economic revenues and expenditures during his tenure have been printed into a general register, totaling 13,835 yuan in silver from previous management items, and a total of seven new revenue items totaling 1,539,466 yuan in silver. There were a total of nine expenditure items, totaling 1,531,588 yuan in silver. After offsetting revenues and expenditures, the actual balance was 21,713 yuan in silver, of which 5,600 yuan was kept for land reporting by officials and subsidies for Sichuan travelers in Tianjin, and relief bonds with a face value of 6,000 yuan and tap water bonds with a face value of 1,348 yuan and 9 jiao were separately stored. The accounts attached to the general register are very clear.</p>
<h3>Extension of the Qingxiang Campaign in Jiangsu Province for Three Months</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, based on a report from the Department of Civil Affairs requesting an extension of the original deadline for the Qingxiang campaign due to insufficient time for completion, approved the request in a meeting. The original report from the Department of Civil Affairs is recorded below: Upon investigation, the counties ordered to carry out the Qingxiang campaign this time were limited to Taihu Lake, the lakeside and nearby counties. According to the provisions of Article 3 of the promulgated Qingxiang Regulations, the third section of the department added a unit to handle the matter specifically. The scope was limited to eleven counties, including Wujiang, Wuxian, Wuxi, Wujin, Yixing, Qingpu, Kunshan, Changshu, Songjiang, Jinshan, and Liyang. In accordance with the resolutions of the Provincial Affairs Conference, the campaign should start in July and last for three months, at which point a report should be submitted. However, the counties submitted their establishment reports at different times due to unsolved bandit problems or pending funding. Recently, nine counties, including Jurong, Jiangning, Lishui, Jintan, Gaochun, Danyang, Zhenjiang, Jiangpu, and Liuhe, and Tongru, Taijing, and the guard area Yangzhong, Yizheng, and Jiangdu, were subsequently ordered to carry out the Qingxiang campaign. These areas were outside the original Taihu Lake plan and began at later dates. For example, Danyang County did not submit its establishment report until mid-September. The number of counties increased, and the starting times varied. Considering the situation, it is difficult to complete the campaign within the limited time. Furthermore, the procedures for printing and distributing the household survey forms have been changed repeatedly, and the method has only now been finalized, with the department being responsible for printing the forms and the counties for imitation printing. To date, the forms have not yet been issued, which is also a major obstacle to the progress of the Qingxiang campaign. Now that the three-month deadline has expired, and the Qingxiang campaign is still in progress in various counties, it is necessary to request an extension in order to complete the campaign. In addition to strictly ordering the counties to expedite the campaign, it is proposed to approve an extension of three months so that the Qingxiang campaign in all counties can be completed uniformly. The required funds will be drawn from the surplus funds of the previous Qingxiang unit. If there is a shortfall, the department will allocate additional funds by reducing expenses. The proposal is submitted for consideration and approval.</p>

After a search and arrest by the land and water military police, many bandits were captured and handed over to Jinshan County for interrogation. Previously, the Shanghai water police detective Gu Chungen captured Zhou Amao, a major bandit who robbed Lüxiang. He was escorted through Songjiang today and transferred to the Jinshan County Government for trial according to law.</p>

<p>Rascals Make Excuses to Defraud Villagers: There are rascals outside Fengmen, in the Yishan to Baodaiqiao area, wearing tattered uniforms and using the excuse of sealing ships and recruiting soldiers to arbitrarily intimidate and defraud. They are especially vicious towards female passengers on passing ships. Therefore, the farmers in the area, fearing the possibility of unexpected disasters when traveling between the city and the countryside during the period of opening warehouses to pay rent, jointly reported to the responsible Public Security Sub-bureau, which forwarded the report to the Public Security Bureau requesting the police team to send a team to patrol the area and maintain local security.</p>
<p>General Levy of Commutation Money for Labor to Build Roads: The Sucheng section of the Provincial Highway Fuhe Road will soon begin construction. More than ten li of the road within the urban area requires compulsory labor, which merchants cannot provide. The county construction chiefs, therefore, followed the rules for levying commutation money for compulsory labor to build roads and made a general levy of commutation money yesterday (31st).</p>
<p>They specifically submitted a joint request to the Department of Construction for review and approval.</p>
<p>Banning Plate Head Approval Denied: Qian Agen and other members of the Credit Cooperative in the Nanxun District inside Fengmen stated that the plate head of the six bureaus often coerced the parties involved in marriage matters and arbitrarily demanded prices. Under the clear sky and bright sun, they should be banned. Therefore, they submitted a request to the County Government yesterday (31st). The request to ban the plate head was not approved. All marriage matters will be handled by the cooperative on a trial basis, with fixed prices set for cooperative marriage ceremonies. A summary of the regulations was also enclosed for review. County Chief Huang stated in the report that the six bureaus of the plate head are also a business and difficult to ban. Coercion and extortion should be strictly banned. Therefore, the ban was not approved.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Wood Fraudulent Scheme Exposed and Arrested: The Xintai Timber Company outside the North Gate of Xiyi, under the Wuqiao Bridge, is a branch of Baoxingchang near Pujiqiao. It has strong capital and is doing well in business. On the afternoon of the 28th of last month, two people from Yancheng, Jiang Deyuan and Liu Wencai, went to the company and falsely claimed, "We are now building large houses in Dongting Town, so we have come to buy wood." Jiang Deyuan also claimed that they had four rice transport barges. The company believed them and sent shop employee Yu to greet them. Yu selected eight pieces of wide wood (worth 88 yuan) and 220 pieces of Longnan wood (worth 575 yuan) from the wood piles on the riverbank at the door, totaling 723 yuan including a commission of 59 yuan. Jiang and Liu ordered the company to tie the selected wood with ropes and issue an invoice. The next day (29th) morning, Jiang and Liu went to the timber company again to select five pieces of Yang pine (worth 22 yuan) and 500 pieces of market top wood (worth 57 yuan), totaling 80 yuan and 9 jiao including commission. The company issued another invoice. Jiang and Liu then claimed that they would pay for and pick up the wood at 9:00 AM the next day (30th) and that they were currently staying at Room 23 of the Jiaotong Hostel under the Gongyun Bridge. However, on the 30th, when Jiang and others did not come to pay for the goods, shop employee Yu went to Room 23 of the Jiaotong Hostel to inquire. Jiang and the others had already left the hostel and could not be found. The company then realized they had been deceived and could only complain. In total, the company was defrauded of three yuan and six jiao in cash by Jiang and Liu, and suffered a loss of about fifteen or sixteen yuan for two lunches and the reorganization and tying of the disordered wood piles on the river. Unexpectedly, Jiang and Liu were flaunting their fraudulent scheme near the West Gate at about 4:00 PM when they were discovered by the squad soldiers of the county's water patrol team, who immediately stepped forward and arrested Jiang and Liu together and escorted them to the team headquarters. Captain Qian Tianxiong interrogated them strictly, ordered them to be guarded, and waited for them to be sent to the county for legal action.</p>
<p>Wuxi-Liyang Evening Steamers Collect Merchants' Anti-Theft Methods: Recently, the China Merchants, Zhonghua, New Merchants, and Yonggu four steamer companies stated that the waterways their ships travel are very remote and have many ambushes in places such as north of Beixin Bridge, Ruomao Lake, west of Guantang Bridge, Beiyang Lake, west of Yuncun, and Xiaoniangtang and Wudongqiao. The size of the Fanhe and the river and lake areas in the Yili section is vast, and the harbor and Han are varied, and have always been areas where lake bandits appear. Ships are particularly afraid of them. Recently, the Jiulihe Yuncun Zhuzhuang Qiaohang has been robbed twice in less than half a month. With winter approaching, there are increasing suspicious items between Wuxi and Liyang. It is urgent to prepare preventive measures. Yesterday, they jointly sent a letter to the Wuxi Shipping Association to forward to the Wuxi, Wujin, Yixing, and Liyang County Chamber of Commerce chairmen, setting a date to invite the responsible persons of the banking and financial industries of each county to come to Wuxi to jointly discuss anti-theft methods for steamers to protect the safety of travelers.</p>
<p>Continued News of the Liyang County Bureau Chief Being Sent to the Province: The case of Liyang County Chief Zheng Chengyuan and Finance Bureau Chief Pan Bin colluding to embezzle and manipulate old strings is being investigated, and the relevant personnel have been arrested and held in custody by the provincial government. On the evening of the 29th, Qian Jiaxiang, a section chief of the provincial government, and Wang Jigang, a clerk, interrogated them together. Chairman Ye personally questioned them and was very angry at Pan and others' private embezzlement. On the afternoon of the 20th, Ren Shuchun, the director of the Liyang Education Bureau, and Di Zhenxuan, the chief of the General Affairs Section, were also interrogated and ordered to be imprisoned. After the interrogation, Ren wrote a name card to Yang of the Liyang Education Bureau, stating that someone had accused Director Di, and he himself was only a witness, asking him to be at ease. It is also reported that Wang Xing'an, a revenue collector from the Liyang Finance Bureau, went to the provincial government to surrender and said that he had the original statement of the case, so the true facts of the case will not be difficult to clarify.</p>
<p>Requesting Permission to Mine Taihu Mountain Stone: He Yushu of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining previously received a report from inspectors that stone merchants were mining mountain stone, which was damaging the scenery of Taihu Lake, and ordered County Chief Pan to strictly prohibit villagers from mining. Yesterday, Zhang Guangdi, the chief of the district (third district), directly filed a complaint with the provincial government requesting a change to the original case and requesting the county government to temporarily postpone implementation.</p>

In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the five representatives from Zhejiang and Shanghai who went to Beijing to petition, Wang Xiaolai, Gu Jinchen, Shen Huachen, Huang Jinfan, and Zhu Jing'an, came to Wuxi by car from Shanghai. In the evening, they boarded the express train to Beijing with the two representatives from this county, Cheng Bingruo and Qian Fenghao, to petition the National Government.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Store Employee Beating a Person to Death Sentenced to Imprisonment: Fan Youren, an employee of Ye Qiyuan's hotel outside Daximen in this county, had an argument with customer A Zhou last month, resulting in a mutual fight between the two. A Zhou was no match and died from his injuries. Fan fled immediately. The county government sent detectives to strictly arrest him, and Fan was arrested in Baimao, Changshu County. After several interrogations by Hearing Officer Chen, he was sentenced to five years of imprisonment yesterday and immediately sent to prison for execution.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Kidnapping and Ransom Case Occurs in the Fifth District: At about 9:00 PM on the 29th, more than 20 bandits suddenly came to the home of Yu Kunyuan in Hanyu Village, Jiufeng North Township, Fifth District of Wuyi, and first used a giant stone to break open the gate, then climbed over the wall and dragged Yu's younger brother Kunrong out of bed, tightly tied his eyes with blue cloth, and tried to carry him out the door. Kunyuan stepped forward and knelt to beg. The bandits said that after his brother was taken away, he would definitely not suffer any pain, and that they were limited to quickly raise 1,000 yuan in cash within three days to contact and hand over the money at a certain place in Xiaohu, Beixiang. After saying that, they carried Kunrong away.</p>
<p>Important Cases in the County Government Meeting: The Wuyi County Government held its 24th county government meeting on the morning of the 30th. The important resolutions were: (1) The Finance Bureau reported that the expenses for the wounded soldiers' residence should be temporarily paid by the local government. Please negotiate the return of the funds previously paid by the bureau to comply with the law. How should this matter be handled? The decision was that the expenses should be temporarily paid by the asset office, and after the end of the expenses, the county bureau will report and request a return of the funds. (2) The Construction Bureau proposed to allow the County Party Headquarters Standing Committee Xu Wenjun, etc., to first build the Wuyi Road and then the Zhenhu Road Wujin section. Is this feasible? It is hoped that the resolution will be approved to build the Wuyi Road first and then the Zhenhu Road Wujin section. The county bureau will report to the Construction Department for review and approval.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Meicheng District Suffers Another Robbery: Ji Shanzeng and Xue Rentai, who jointly opened the Hemaoxing Flower Shop in Yaotun, Wencun Town, Meitang District, in this county, have been quite successful in their business for two years and have accumulated quite a lot of savings. However, three bandits came in the middle of the night the day before yesterday, each carrying a pistol. They first tied up the owner with gauze ropes and prohibited him from making a sound, then arbitrarily searched and robbed the place. As a result, a total of 93 yuan in cash, 45,000 copper coins, a gold ring, a mandarin jacket, a lined jacket, a lined robe, and a gold watch were robbed. The owner reported to the Public Security Sub-bureau the next day and requested that the perpetrators be arrested.</p>
<p>Bank President Smoking in Court: In mid-September, Xu Junda, a resident of Nanmen, reported that he had captured Hao Shebo, the president of the Bank of China, for smoking in his house. The county government scheduled the trial for October 30. Yesterday (30th) at 2:00 PM, only the defendant Hao Shebo arrived on the side of the party concerned, while the plaintiff Xu Junda, the defendant Wang Tianyi, and the witnesses did not report. According to the interrogation of Hearing Officer Shi, Hao Shebo, the current president of the Changshu branch of the Bank of China, does not smoke. On the night of September 10, he was sick at home, and the smoking paraphernalia found was Wang Tianyi's. Wang had returned after not having succeeded in doing something. For the sake of his own reputation, he went to the Nanjing headquarters to request an investigation, which had already proved that he was not addicted. All the medical reports had been submitted to the court in a written statement the day before yesterday, and then he adjourned.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>County Government Handles the Disposal of Military Land: The Nantong County Government, ordered by the Ministry of Military Affairs, ordered the Tonghai Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company on the 30th to send a responsible person to the county within 20 days to make up for the price of the Su Lang military land that was encroached upon. If they are unwilling to fulfill the order, they will submit a request to the Ministry of Military Affairs to send a committee to jointly mark the fee.</p>
<p>County Court Explains the Reasons for Releasing Yang and Wu: The Nantong community is paying close attention to the county court's prosecutor's office's release of Yang Jinyun and Wu Qinmin, the perpetrators of the Pingchao bandit case. The prosecutor's office stated that the Pingchao District Office recognized Yang and Wu as bandits, but those who actually arrested them were based on the report of Wu Sheng, a Taoist priest, and Chen Dejian. However, the date of detention of the defendants was August 19, and the date of the report was August 11. There is no doubt that the arrest was first and the report was later, which is obviously a supplementary document made after the fact. Moreover, the direct victims of the bandit disaster were Wang Xia and Si Zhenyuan, and had absolutely no relationship with Wu Sheng, a Taoist priest, and Chen Dejian. There are no victims who do not report, and those who report are unrelated people. Yang Jinyun and others claimed that the district chief Zhang Kui had a feud with them and wanted to frame them, so they colluded with Wu Sheng, a Taoist priest, and others to make this false report, which is credible. Moreover, Yang Jin's family was robbed by bandits once on August 9 of this year, and Wu Qinmin's family was robbed by bandits once on July 10 of this year, both of which were reported to the District Office and forwarded to the court for investigation. It is impossible for them to be bandits themselves and suffer from bandit disasters. Based on the above reasons, the defendants' suspicion of committing a crime is very insufficient.</p>
<p>Ma Yuren Did Not Flee to Lüsi: Ma Yuren, who was causing trouble in the Yancheng-Funing area, was defeated by the Provincial Security Regiment. It was rumored that Ma had fled to Lüsi. After an investigation by the official government, it was found to be untrue.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Defeated Bandits from the Niuyutao Area Gather in Feihuaxu: Some days ago, many bandits engaged in a fierce battle with the investigation team in the Niuyutao Daba area, injuring three people, including detective leader Ma Shiliang. It has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now reported that the bandits have fled to Feihuaxu in recent days. Now, each household in the area houses three or four people, and the villagers are ordered to provide three meals a day. The villagers cannot bear the suffering of going at night and coming in the day. Any young women have fled elsewhere to avoid being defiled. Last night, village elders held a secret meeting to prepare representatives to come to the province and ask the province to suppress the bandits to appease the people.</p>
<p>Lianzhuang Society Arbitrarily Detains Good People in Wei Gang Village: The chief of the 24th township of the second district of Zhenjiang, Jie Jingyun, and the people's representative, Wang Xianming, said that the chairman of the Jurong Chen Wuzhuang Lianzhuang Society, Zhao Deben, and Chen Jizeng, took advantage of the bandit-suppression army's visit to the township to arbitrarily detain good people from Wei Gang Village, Tu Qiju, Wang Youxing, Tang Xinglin, and others without releasing them. Now they are demanding huge amounts of money, and the people are suffering endlessly. Yesterday, they submitted a request to District Chief Wu in the area to forward it to the Chen County Government and the Department of Civil Affairs, and directly to the Security Office for rescue.</p>
<p>Provincial Rectification Committee Requests Thorough Investigation of the Zhongda Storm: The Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Rectification Committee stated that the Central University is the highest institution of learning in the country, and the promotion and demotion of the school's president and the measures of the Minister of Education have a significant impact on national education. Their words and actions should be particularly cautious in order to set an example. However, since the student unrest at the school occurred, the school and the education authorities have not followed proper methods to handle the matter, but have only published talks and letters in the newspapers. The content of these articles is especially lacking in discipline, and the newspapers have reprinted them, making the incident a laughingstock at home and abroad. This is not a phenomenon that should occur under party rule. Now the school is in a state of turmoil and uneasiness. If it is not resolved immediately, it will be easier for opponents to create opportunities over time. Therefore, a telegram was sent to the central government urging the National Government to quickly investigate the truth.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Provincial Inspector Investigates the Chengwu Bandit Suppression Dispute: The day before yesterday (3rd), a special service company from the fortress and the 4th Company of the Changzhou Military Police killed Peng Quanlin and showed his head to the public in Baizhang, Wujin. Wujin claimed that Peng Quanlin was the younger brother of the town chief and filed a complaint with the province accusing Liu Zai, the district chief of the 6th district, of killing people across the border. Before this case was settled, the Department of Civil Affairs sent an inspector, Zhang , to investigate the two counties of Chengwu. Zhang first went to Baizhang for investigation. On the 28th, he went to Houmei Xishiqiao and reported the situation to the special service company stationed there, as well as the conversation with District Chief Liu. Zhang expressed his opinion that this matter was caused by the usual disagreement between the two counties. It is true that Peng Quanlin is a good person. The procedures were lacking because they were not notified in advance during the suppression. The participants replied that since the Huang Zhuquan bandit suppression case in the 17th year, Wujin has regarded it as a hateful enemy. It is true that the so-called usual disagreement exists. The gun that Peng Quanlin injured the special service company's bugler seems suspicious. If the bandit suppression is notified in advance, the secret may be leaked. It is difficult to hope that Zhang will deliberate and review the matter. On the 29th, Zhang went to the city to meet with County Chief Li to inquire about everything. Today (30th), he returned to the province to report.</p>
<p>Large Batch of Military Supplies Escorted to the District Department: Ding Guangqi, Patrol Officer No. 5 of the 20th Brigade, 1st Detachment, 5th District of the Waterborne Public Security Corps, successively seized a large number of guns and ammunition smuggled by Jiangbei Xuanxuan ships in Huangtiangang. The shipowner of six people has been logged in this newspaper. The day before yesterday, Captain Shen has escorted 97 wooden shell rifles, 18 horses, 10 box guns, 259 parts, and the shipowners Sun Zehai and others to the Guazhou District Department for handling.</p>
<p>Autopsy of Unnamed Male Corpse: A nameless male corpse was discovered the day before yesterday by a cattle-herding boy in Cunyi Township, Sanrenqiao North, outside Shuangpai Bridge in the eastern suburbs. The corpse's face had rotted, and there were rope marks on its neck. It was about 20 years old, naked on the upper body and wearing only trousers. After the Township Office reported to the county, County Chief Li of the Public Security Bureau went to the township to perform an autopsy and had the corpse collected by the local bailiff.</p>
<p>Director of Sericulture Farm Changes: Zhang Pei, director of the county sericulture farm, resigned from the Department of Agriculture and Mining due to thorny issues. Inspector Shen Huaiyuan has now been appointed to replace him.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>A Case Filed Against the Xuan Shaolun Steamer: The Yongxin Company's Xuan Shaolun small steamer was robbed in Qiushuge before the robbery. Zhou Zigeng, the chief of Laijia Township near the area, the township deputy Gao Yongpan, Gao Yongxing, and Li led more than 100 villagers to Qiushuge and ordered the ship to stop. The driver, Lao Da, saw the fierce situation and had to stop the ship. Zhou shouted to set fire to it. At this time, gunshots suddenly rang out, scattering Zhou and others. Seeing this, more than 20 bandits took the opportunity to rob the ship. Wang Huting, the manager of the shipping company, said that Zhou and others were highly suspected of being involved in the robbery and has now filed a criminal lawsuit in the Yangzhou court.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Case of Bandits Injuring People in the Qishumiao Temple: Hua Fei, a wealthy family in Qishumiao Temple, Shaobo, recently had a child turning one year old. Friends and relatives gathered. The next day, six or seventy bandits came and claimed to be offering supplementary congratulations (it was heard that the bandit leader Hua Fei had treated Hua's family diligently, hoping to avoid disaster). However, as soon as they saw Hua's face, they opened fire and shot him in the abdomen, killing him on the spot. They also robbed the Taixiang and Zhang Yuanlong oil shops in the town, each losing 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>They also demanded 5,000 yuan from each merchant as the price for eliminating evil and pacifying the people, and designated Chenjiazhuang in Luyang Lake as the place to receive the money. They left the town at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Jailer Changes: Sun Chuanfu, the jailer of this county's prison, was ordered by the High Court to be transferred to Jinshan County to replace Cheng Fushang, the jailer. After receiving the order, Sun went to Suzhou yesterday (29th) to meet with the president of the High Court and personally report on all prison affairs. Before the new jailer arrives, Ding Maotian, the director, will temporarily take charge.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Execution by Firing Squad of Robbers from Taozhuang: The Jiahu Bandit Suppression Command and the Second District Water Police Department previously apprehended three bandits and one suspect during bandit suppression operations in the Gaolu area. After interrogation by Commander Xu, the District Head of Hangzhou, two bandits were executed by firing squad on the spot in Taozhuang Township. The bandit Zhang Xiaodi and the suspect Sun Yingde were brought back for further investigation by the Command. The suspect Sun Yingde has since been released on bail by the Jiashan Security Corps. Bandit Zhang Xiaodi confessed to robberies in Taozhuang and other places, and was sentenced to death by the Command. The sentence was approved by the provincial government, and on the 30th, the prisoner was identified and escorted to the scene of the crime in Taozhuang Township for execution by firing squad.</p>
<p>Request for Bereavement Allowance for Deceased Water Police: On January 14th of this year, officers and police of the Third Squad of the Second District Patrol Team of the Jiaxing Water Police were ordered to suppress bandits in the Shenjia Road area in front of the Jiangsu Temple. Seventeen personnel, including the deceased Ma Zongliang, have already been approved for bereavement allowances to be issued to their families. The Ministry also ordered that the bereavement allowances should be issued by the relevant provinces and counties. Therefore, the squad leader, Wang Deqing, found that the families of the deceased ship captain Shen Shoupeng's widow, Shen Li, and water patrol Zhang Xiuxing's widow, Zhang Cai, were originally from Jiaxing. He has prepared a document requesting the local county authorities to investigate and allocate the bereavement allowances.</p>

The brigade headquarters will be established in Wufu. Personnel from the First Branch Office and the Third Detachment of the New Recruit Training Center, originally stationed in Wufu Camp, totaling 500 to 600 men, arrived in Yong yesterday morning by special train and stayed overnight at various inns on the north bank of the Jiang River. They plan to travel to Beijing on the Tangshan Wheel steamer today.</p>
<p>The Army Repulses a Large Band of Local Bandits: In the Yujiakeng and Chen Dakeng areas near Yuyao, more than a hundred bandits recently gathered, forming a gang and running rampant in the countryside. The bandit leader, surnamed Ying, claimed to be the "Commander-in-Chief" and wore an armed belt. They had more than 120 firearms. The local people suffered greatly. The Sixth Regiment of the Security Corps learned of this and, in addition to stationing heavy troops at Beizhuang, Donglin, and Ting to prevent them from fleeing, ordered the Eleventh Company of the Third Battalion of the Security Corps stationed in Tangxi to rush to the area to attack. The soldiers of the company encountered the bandits at Damailing and other places and fought fiercely for an hour before the bandits were scattered. Many bandits were killed in the battle, and one was captured alive and sent to the Yuyao Battalion Headquarters for transfer to the Baigong Regiment Headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>Important Educational News</p>
<h3>Jiang Menglin and Zhang Naiyan Accuse Each Other</h3>
<p>Jiang Says: He is deeply saddened by the criticism he has received for maintaining Zhongda in every way.</p>
<p>Zhang Says: What is meant by making a big deal out of a small one? The statements are inconsistent.</p>
<p>(1) Jiang Menglin Reiterates His Defense</p>
<p>Zhongda President Zhang Naiyan sent a letter to all teachers and students of the school, clarifying the situation of this disturbance. Since it involved Education Minister Jiang Menglin, the reporter recorded Jiang's four points of conversation regarding Zhang Naiyan's letter a few days ago and published it in this newspaper. Now it is known that Jiang Menglin again spoke with a reporter about this matter. His remarks are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Zhongda is the highest institution of learning in the capital, and the central government has high expectations for it. I, as the Education Minister, have always hoped that Zhongda can become a better university in the country. Therefore, I have tried my best to help the school in every way, such as increasing the school's funding and determining the source of funding, subsidizing students' study expenses, etc. The facts are there. I recently read in the newspaper that President Zhang...</p>
<p>...behind the school's turmoil, there is me. As for the cause of the school's turmoil, whether it is as President Zhang said, we can only verify the facts. Now, I will briefly state the facts that are clearly inconsistent. (1) Regarding the university's funding, the Ministry first proposed a payment method and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Executive Yuan, according to the submission, instructed the Ministry on August 31st of the 18th year that the actual expenditure of the university's funding was 1.32 million yuan, which would be permanently provided by the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office. The shortfall for the 18th year would be subsidized by the Ministry of Finance at 50,000 yuan per month. The Ministry immediately instructed the university to inform them, and also informed the students who had repeatedly sent representatives to the Ministry to petition for this matter, instructing them to rest assured in their studies. The official document of the instruction was issued on September 3rd of the same year. How can it be said that the Ministry only sent a letter to the students and the school only learned about it then? (2) This summer, the students of the College of Education of the school had an organization to visit the Northeast Education, and they sent several letters to the Ministry requesting subsidies. At first, it was not approved because the students directly requested it. Later, Dean Wei of the college repeatedly explained the importance of the visit, and colleagues in the Ministry also believed that the detailed situation of all educational facilities in the Northeast provinces, which are located between the two major powers of Japan and Russia, should be clearly understood, and the students' ambition was also commendable. Therefore, it was agreed to subsidize 800 yuan. This amount was sent by the Ministry to the Central University for forwarding to the students. On August 14th, President Zhang submitted a report to the Ministry to continue requesting a subsidy of 700 yuan. Although the Ministry's funds were tight at the time, because President Zhang submitted a report based on the facts, another 300 yuan was continued to be subsidized. This was the actual process at the time. Now, President Zhang said in his letter that "Because this school has always subsidized 20 yuan per person, Minister Jiang specially subsidized thousands of yuan, so this school is relatively embarrassed." It seems that he forgot that he had submitted a document requesting funds. It is very strange. In short, since I returned to China, I have been in the education sector. I have been a professor, a university president, a director of education, and a minister of education. I have never been separated from the education career for a day, and I have always done things with my conscience. Those who know me can testify. This time, the school turmoil at Central University, I, with my responsibilities, hope to make it smaller and smaller, and to make it disappear. Unexpectedly, President Zhang's letter contains many allusions, or it may be due to unclear hearing. I think that I have maintained Zhongda in every way, but I have been criticized, and I feel very sad. Moreover, the things he cited to criticize me are not consistent with the facts, so I specially cite this to inform you. After the talk, Jiang also produced the original text of Zhongda's request to the Ministry of Education for subsidies for the study tour, and published it to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Appendix: Central University's Request to the Ministry of Education for Additional Subsidies for Travel Expenses for the Northeast Study Tour of the College of Education</p>
<p>The case is based on a letter from the Ministry: "Dear Sir, the Ministry originally planned to send students studying education to the Northeast to study education. Now that your school has organized a Northeast Education Study Tour, I am very pleased. I have specially subsidized the tour fee of 800 yuan. A check for one paper is attached to the letter. Please check and forward it to Fan Diji, the affairs officer of the tour group, and obtain a receipt and send it to the Ministry for future reference." In addition, according to Dong Dejian and other members of the Northeast Education Study Tour of the College of Education of the school, the students of the College of Education are now planning to go to the Northeast to study education. In addition to the 800 yuan subsidized by the Ministry of Education, the budget is still insufficient. It is planned to ask the school to subsidize them. According to the regulations of the school for student visits, each person is limited to 20 yuan. Recently, the funds have been extremely exhausted. The 50,000 yuan allocated by the Ministry of Finance each month has not been issued for five, six, or seven months. The Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office has accumulated arrears for one and a half months. The current situation is very difficult to maintain. The subsidy for the Northeast Study Tour of the College of Education this time should be subsidized by 20 yuan per person according to the graduation visit precedent. According to the budget of the tour group, there is still a shortage of 700 yuan. Under the current financial difficulties of the school, it is really impossible to allocate funds. And once a precedent is broken, there will be no huge amount of money to cope with the future requests for precedents. According to the Ministry, the Ministry originally planned to send students studying education to the Northeast to study education, and there must be a certain plan. The number of educational deficiencies is still requested to be completed from the beginning to the end, and the subsidies should be continued to be allocated in full so that it can be completed. In addition to the check receipt, it will be sent after it is obtained. The letter is hereby prepared and respectfully requested to be allocated as soon as possible for public convenience. This is a letter to the Ministry of Education, Zhang Naiyan, President of the National Central University.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education instructed to allocate 300 yuan in the text: "I know that the Ministry's funds are also in difficulty. The requested continuation of the subsidy should be approved for another 300 yuan, and the order is attached for immediate check and transfer to Fan Diji, the affairs officer of the tour group, and obtain a receipt and send it to the Ministry for future reference." This order.</p>
<p>(2) Zhang Naiyan's Letter to Jiang Menglin</p>
<p>Mr. Menglin, I read in the newspaper today about Mr. Jiang's four reasons for the debate. Whether the reasons are sufficient to eliminate... bright-eyed people will know it. For example, in the fourth item, Mr. Jiang said that he never informed Jiang about the existence of a wrestling field. President Chiang has determined to rectify the school spirit, so how does Mr. Jiang know about the wrestling field? What President Chiang knows, Mr. Jiang does not know. Besides, in the past two years, Mr. Jiang has not informed me as much as I have not informed the Ministry. But why is it that today's small school turmoil is reported to Feng Hua by telegram every day? (Long live the President, small school turmoil must be reported by telegram for thousands of miles every day, and it seems to be reported to the President to decide, so that the Ministry of Education can be exempted from being a grand setting?) Mr. Jiang's words are inconsistent and different before and after, which is something that the unlearned cannot predict. I am ignorant and only narrate what I think. Mr. Jiang said that what is meant by making a big deal out of a small one is referring to the Minister? School turmoil is small, and the Minister's matter is big, so I know the sin. Please be safe, Zhang Naiyan respectfully opened on October 30th, 19th year (Xin She)</p>
<p>(3) Important Announcement by Tu Juyao and Others</p>
<p>Reactions to Zhang Naiyan's Letter</p>
<p>Solemn Explanation and No Background</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Tu Juyao and others, who proposed improving school affairs at Zhongda, issued an important announcement today because Principal Zhang Naiyan issued a letter to all faculty, staff, and students, saying that "there are many people who can tell the background of the school's repeated turmoils." The wording is ambiguous and thought-provoking. Juyao and others are the initiators of this improvement of school affairs, and they cannot but speak out here, that is, Juyao and others' request for improvement is purely based on the sincerity of loving the school. Because of the hope for the school's authorities to improve all school affairs, they have to widely seek public opinion and observe public sentiment. Therefore, the publication of the letter to all faculty, staff, and students takes legal steps and raises legitimate demands. All measures have never exceeded the norm, and the principal's order on the 16th said, "This kind of action is not what the students should have," and then said, "Don't interfere in school affairs." It has gone far from the facts. However, Juyao and others still endure without saying a word, sincerely wanting to improve school affairs so as not to hinder its progress due to the resistance of the top and bottom. Therefore, since submitting the proposal to the principal, they have always maintained a peaceful attitude and quietly waited for the authorities to decide. And in order to avoid the expansion of the incident and to prevent opportunists from creating opportunities, all responses and movements that are different from Juyao and others' improvement proposals are not related to them. This intention is obvious and clear, and it is not difficult for my classmates to see through. If the authorities have the sincerity to attract students' suggestions, they should not delay any longer. But things are greatly mistaken. The principal, after leaving school and standing in Shanghai, was actually confused by the floating words of the left and right. Recently, in the letter to the faculty, staff, and students, he actually mentioned that "there are many people who can tell the background of the school's repeated turmoils." The more the saying comes out, the more strange it is. It is really impossible for people to understand it a hundred times. Here, what Juyao and others should solemnly declare is that the motive of Juyao and others' request for improvement this time is to be dissatisfied with the school's current situation. The purpose of thinking about improvement is to seek an ideal school in order to live up to the expectations of the Chinese people. The background is the conscience, but if it is the technique of flattering and flattery, it is not a specialty. There are many unjust things in the world, so I use them. I hope that the public will understand.</p>
<p>(4) Huang Pu huan Please Principal Zhang to Return to School</p>
<p>Groundless Insults are Not Worthy of Pity</p>
<p>Please Return to School Quickly to Preside Over Everything</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Huang Puhuan, the chief of general affairs of Central University, was forced to leave the school by the students after holding the memorial week of Dr. Sun Yat-sen a few days ago. Huang sent a letter to President Zhang Naiyan the day before (28th) to explain the reasons and asked Zhang to return to school to preside over everything. The original letter is recorded as follows: President Junmou, this change in the administrative organization of the school was originally initiated by Zhang Junzuoshi and promoted by Lü Junmiannan, and it was you who announced and implemented it. I have never approved or disapproved of this proposal, and I have no intention of it in the slightest. This is something that you know well and the whole school should forgive. After the proposal to merge the three places into one place became a fact, you mistakenly entrusted me to be the chief of general affairs. I should take on this heavy responsibility with my talent and fear that I would fail. I repeatedly pleaded to resign to make way for the capable, but you told me the great meaning and did not approve it. I had to agree to temporarily take on its lack. Later, I suddenly read the letter you published in Shanghai to President Chiang to resign, and I planned to follow you and retire to be in line with your intention. At the right time, I was shown the obligation to maintain order in the school during the transition period between the old and the new, and I was not afraid to go. Unexpectedly, people inside and outside the school did not observe my foolish sincerity, but said that Puhuan was the initiator of this administrative organization change. The complaints gathered on one person, and one or two students took advantage of you to leave Beijing for Shanghai and then agitated, which led to the turmoil during the memorial week of Dr. Sun Yat-sen a few days ago. They even insulted me for no reason. Thinking of this, I am extremely heartbroken. I am not worthy of pity, but what about the future of this school? As I have been unable to carry out your orders, I have temporarily maintained school affairs. Please immediately return to school to preside over everything, and I hope to announce the process immediately to clarify right and wrong and to purify the school spirit. I am extremely panicked and waiting for orders. I am respectfully waiting for Daoan. Huang Puhuan respectfully inscribed on October 28th.</p>

<h3>Management Issues of the Beiping Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Center</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan Ordered the Two Ministries to Discuss and Decide</p>
<p>Appropriate Allocations of the Boxer Indemnity Funds to Expand</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan of the National Government, according to a telegram from the Beiping Autonomous Region Offices, requested that the Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Center be clearly transferred to the Beiping Autonomous Organ and the Museum of Handcrafts be reorganized for management, and that the Boxer Indemnity Funds be appropriately allocated to expand it. The Executive Yuan ordered the two ministries of Education and Interior to deliberate and reply. The telegram from Beiping and the order from the Executive Yuan are recorded below: (1) The telegram from the Beiping City Autonomous Region Offices stated that the Beiping Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Center was established in the early years of the Republic of China, originally intended to develop the city and prosper. The method was not complete and the effect was not good. It is found that every major city in the East and West has a municipal museum, which gathers the elites of the world to make people's research respectful. Please clearly transfer the Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Center to the Beiping City Autonomous Organ and reorganize the museum. Among the citizens, regardless of Chinese or foreign, select people with knowledge and credit to organize a management committee, which is still supervised by the Ministry of Interior and the Mayor of Beiping. Please also state that the Boxer Indemnity Funds returned by the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan are used for literature</p>
<p>for cultural and preservation of ancient relics, appropriate allocation of funds to expand and improve to avoid political changes, and collect the effects of broadening thinking, the Palace Museum is nationally owned and the municipal museum is municipally owned, the nature is distinct and the functions are different, which will benefit the future of cultural municipal administration, etc. (1) The Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Education, stating that the memorandum from the Civil Service Office was approved by the Chairman to send down a telegram from the Beiping City Autonomous Region Offices requesting that the Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Center be clearly transferred to the Beiping City Autonomous Organ and the Museum of Handcrafts be reorganized for management, and that the Boxer Indemnity Funds be appropriately allocated to expand it. The order was given to the Executive Yuan, etc. accordingly, and the original documents were copied and sent to the Department for reference. In addition to replying to and separately ordering, the original telegram was copied and sent, ordering the Department to discuss and reply jointly with the Ministry of Interior.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Banned "Modern Middle School Students"</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education approved the Central Propaganda Department's letter requesting the transfer of the order to the provincial and municipal offices to transfer it to the middle schools to ban the book "Modern Middle School Students" (because it promotes class struggle).

<h3>Anhui Province University Will Build a New School Building</h3>
<p>Construction Costs 120,000</p>
<p>Already Deposited in the Anqing Treasury</p>
<p>Anhui University originally had a school building rented from foreign churches, so the school's budget for the 18th year was provisionally set at 300,000 yuan for construction and equipment fees. However, due to the provincial treasury's difficulties, no money was received. Of the 145,969 yuan in the school's remaining funds, 120,000 yuan was deposited in the treasury for the construction of school buildings in accordance with the previous order of the provincial government. The Ministry of Finance will allocate 120,000 yuan of the arrears to the Anqing Treasury for storage and send the receipt for the payment to the school, so the construction costs have a clue. However, the school had previously organized a committee for the construction of school buildings to plan the construction. The committee members were elected by the provincial government party department and the school together, and nine people were organized (the provincial government: Director of the Education Hall Cheng Tianfang, Director of the Construction Hall Li Fanyi, Committee Member Jin Weifan; the provincial party department: Minister of Training Wu Qiyun, Minister of Organization Wang Jianjin, Minister of Propaganda Xiong Xu; the school: President Yang Lianggong, President Ding Xuxian, Chief of General Affairs Cheng Yangzhi). The original provincial government committee members Jin Weifan and Li Fanyi were also dismissed during the reorganization of the provincial government. The school again submitted a request to the provincial government to re-appoint two committee members. The provincial government decided at the 142nd meeting to appoint Yuan Jiapu, Director of the Ministry of Finance, and Chen Shu, Director of the Construction Hall, as members of the school building construction committee. It will be able to convene a meeting soon to plan everything. All teachers and students of the school believe that the construction of the school building is the key to the school's survival, and they all hope that it will be realized as soon as possible. President Yang is also planning to proceed. The school now has the three colleges of literature, law, and science. The College of Literature has three departments: Chinese Literature, Philosophy, Education, and Foreign Literature. The College of Law has three departments: Political Science, Economics, and Law. The College of Science has three departments: Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. It is also planned to add a Biology Department in the future, which is currently being prepared. There are more than 500 students in the school. The deans and department heads of the colleges hired this semester have arrived at the school one after another before and after the start of school. The dean of the College of Science is currently hired by Ding Xuxian, director of the Department of Chemistry at Peking University. Zhang Weici, dean of the College of Law, has been reassigned as the school's librarian. The dean of the College of Law will be held by Liu Yingshi. Cheng Yansheng, dean of the College of Literature, was delayed in Shanghai due to business and has only recently arrived at the school.

<h3>First Day of the East China Four Universities Volleyball Tournament</h3>
<p>The East China Athletic Association, organized by four universities—Jinling, Soochow, Shanghai, and Zhejiang—holds various championship competitions in the spring and autumn seasons annually. This season's volleyball competition is being held at Soochow University in Suzhou. The details of yesterday, the first day of the competition, are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>The Past of the Volleyball Championship</h3>
<p>Zhejiang University has had little chance to participate in previous volleyball championships, let alone win, due to a period of suspension in the four universities' competitions. Shanghai University has dominated East China in all-around basketball, while volleyball has traditionally been contested between Soochow and Jinling. The previous championship belonged to Soochow, thanks to the efforts of Chen Fuyu, a strong player. Now that Chen has graduated and left the school, although new players Li Yongxi and Zhou Baijia have outstanding achievements in school, they cannot join because they do not meet the East China rules. Therefore, Jinling, with its well-organized lineup, has a better chance of winning this year's championship.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Defeats Soochow</h3>
<p>The four universities' volleyball tournament adopts a knockout system. The order is set as Soochow vs. Zhejiang, and Shanghai vs. Jinling. On the second day, the winners of the two groups will compete in the final. Yesterday (31st), the first match, Soochow vs. Zhejiang, started at 1:30 PM. The referee was Xu Shaowu. Before the start of the match, both the Soochow team members and the audience were concerned about Zhejiang because Zhejiang had little practice and had not shown its potential, while Soochow was the reigning champion. At the beginning of the match, Soochow's serve was blocked and failed to cross the net, while Zhejiang immediately scored two points. Soochow was greatly encouraged by this, but lost the first game 19 to 21. At the beginning of the second game, Zhejiang attacked even more fiercely. Soochow often lost points because Xia Chuzhang was slow to receive the ball. This game also ended in a 19 to 21 defeat.</p>
<h3>Jinling and Shanghai Universities Did Not Finish the Game</h3>
<p>The second game, refereed by Mr. Xu, was between Jinling and Shanghai University. It started in a light rain, which then turned into a heavy downpour. The audience's interest grew because the players did not stop attacking. Jinling won the first game 21 to 15 against Shanghai University. Just as the second game was about to begin, Shanghai University protested, stating that the game had not been properly started, which greatly disappointed the audience.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Committed a Foul, Shanghai University Forfeited</h3>
<p>At this point, Soochow's instructor, Xu Minhui, etc., held a coaching meeting. As a result, Shanghai University forfeited because Shanghai still had a soccer game today (1st). Although Zhejiang won against Soochow in the preliminary round, middle school students were mixed in, which did not comply with the association's regulations. Therefore, the Zhejiang vs. Soochow game was changed to a friendly match. Thus, the final of the championship team will only be decided by Soochow and Jinling, with Jinling being the more promising. However, if there is heavy rain today (1st), it will be postponed.</p>

<h3>Industry and Commerce Conference Opens Today</h3>
<p>8:00 AM Members Pay Respects at the Mausoleum; 10:00 AM Ceremony Held at the Capital's Lizhi Society</p>
<p>Over 400 Proposals; Over 100 Members Arrived Last Night</p>
<p>The National Industry and Commerce Conference, convened by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, has been in preparation for three months. Today, the opening ceremony will be held at the Lizhi Society in the capital. The conference will last for eight days, bringing together government officials, industry and commerce leaders, and experts from across the country to discuss national development. The details of yesterday's events are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Introduction by Chong Gan</h3>
<p>Now that the military operations are nearing completion, efforts to develop the country and implement the Principle of People's Livelihood cannot be delayed. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in order to implement industrial and commercial policies, promote production, develop foreign trade, and increase the national economy, has convened the National Industry and Commerce Conference, which is a crucial plan for today. Gathering over two hundred industry and commerce leaders and experts to discuss national economy and the people's livelihood is an unprecedented event. How can I not congratulate the country's future? However, as a reporter, I cannot help but express my thoughts on the opening day of the conference:</p>
<p>1. Since the conference has received more than four hundred proposals, all of which are important to industrial and commercial issues, the conference should select the most important and feasible ones to discuss and study first. It should be understood that the underdevelopment of China's industry and commerce is due to various obstacles, not just in the industrial and commercial sectors themselves. Also, when discussing the twenty categories of proposals, a comprehensive observation should be made to understand the interrelationships. After deciding on a case, the steps for implementing each case should also be discussed so that the government can easily adopt them.</p>
<p>2. The members' responsibility in participating in this conference is quite large, and the country has high expectations. They should discuss the proposals with all their strength and participate in fewer banquets. Someone suggested at the Shanghai meeting a few days ago that members should engage in less socializing and more discussion, which is an excellent idea. It is because participants often find socializing burdensome, but cannot disappoint the generous invitations from various organizations.</p>
<p>3. The whole country is delighted that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has convened the conference, and deeply hopes that the government will adopt and implement the resolutions of the conference as much as possible to develop industry and commerce and benefit the people's livelihood. It should not be just empty words without real benefits.</p>
<h3>Expectations for the Industry and Commerce Conference by Pan Xulun</h3>
<p>In order to revitalize industry and commerce and solve the people's livelihood, the National Government has convened the Industry and Commerce Conference through the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, gathering industrial and commercial administrative officials, industry and commerce leaders, and industry and commerce experts from across the country to brainstorm ideas and achieve great results. All Chinese people should hope that this conference will seek a thorough solution to the national livelihood issues. I, Xulun, am not talented but have been appointed to the session, and I have particularly high hopes for this conference. Therefore, I would like to say a word to the Industry and Commerce Conference based on the common psychology of the people:</p>
<p>Since the reform, China has not had a peaceful year for the past twenty years. Not only has the industrial and commercial sector failed to develop as scheduled, but it has also shown a trend of decline. This is undeniable. Now that the military operations have ended and construction has begun, how should the government promote and protect industry and commerce, and how should the people work hard to ensure that the national industry gradually prospers and the people's livelihood becomes richer? The things that should be done are so numerous that they cannot be counted. Therefore, the conference has as many as four hundred proposals. After careful examination, there is not one that is not necessary for today's relief and promotion plan. All of us Chinese people hope that they will be passed and implemented one by one. Although the trend of hope is boundless, the realm of facts is limited, just as the progress of light can be endless but is often blocked by surrounding objects to the point that it cannot leave a room. Therefore, in this conference, we must first recognize the current capabilities of the government and the people and not engage in overly ambitious discussions. All discussions must be based on the hope that the goals can be achieved in fact. Otherwise, empty talk will be of no benefit. Second, we must recognize the most critical point for rescuing the domestic industry and simplify the various proposals into several main proposals for the government to adopt and implement effectively. They should not be detailed and cluttered, so as not to lose focus and lead to no results. The responsibility of the National Industry and Commerce Conference is to determine the main direction of the government's industrial and commercial construction in the future. Other minor cases can also be solved along with it.</p>
<p>As far as my humble opinion is concerned, the hundreds of proposals at this time can be divided into three categories by means of inductive methods: the issue of promoting domestic goods production, the issue of reducing excessive taxes and levies, and the issue of resolving labor-management disputes. However, if we summarize further, reducing excessive taxes and levies and resolving labor-management disputes are the only ways to promote domestic goods production. Therefore, the main proposals of this conference can be said to be only these two. Let's analyze further:</p>
<p>The heavy tax burden in our country, from the perspective of the ability of industry and commerce to bear it, can be said to be the highest in the world. The inability of industry and commerce to develop in recent years is mostly due to the destruction caused by taxes and levies. Reducing them is indeed urgent. However, looking back at the government's financial situation, it has exhausted its resources to the point that it is borrowing money and cannot greatly reduce the tax revenue that should be collected. Therefore, there will be no problem in principle for the conference to pass the tax reduction proposals, but I am afraid that it may not be possible to hope that the government will fully implement them in the shortest possible time. What was the effect of the various economic conferences, financial conferences, and tax reduction conferences convened by the Ministry of Finance in the past? This is enough to prove it. This is not me, Xulun, deliberately making such discouraging remarks before the opening of the Industry and Commerce Conference. It is because the facts are like this and cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Therefore, our only main hope for this Industry and Commerce Conference is to resolve the labor-management disputes. For several years, the national industry and commerce has been declining under the continuous labor-management disputes, which shows that the continuous disputes are enough to cut off the people's livelihood. If they are not resolved, there is no possibility for the survival of the industrial and commercial sectors. However, resolving labor-management disputes is something that can be implemented in terms of the government's ability. I only hope that the Industry and Commerce Conference will discuss in detail how to improve work efficiency, prevent excessive demands from both labor and management, and promote profit sharing between labor and management, and request the government to implement them effectively. Then, not only will the existing industrial and commercial sectors not decline day by day, but also foreign and Chinese investors will also be willing to invest, and the economy of both workers and investors will gradually become more prosperous. I sincerely hope that all the members of the conference will make special efforts to solve this problem so that the gathering of this conference will not be in vain.</p>
<h3>Preparations</h3>
<p>Budget of 9,920 Yuan</p>
<p>In order to implement industrial and commercial policies, promote production, develop foreign trade, and increase the national economy, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has specifically scheduled the convocation of the Industry and Commerce Conference to gather industry and commerce people from across the country to study the implementation plan. The conference is scheduled to open at 10:00 AM today. A summary of the preparations is given as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Approved - The Ministry's Sixth Year of Political Tutelage Work Plan originally scheduled to convene the National Industry and Commerce Conference in the third year. In May of this year, considering the recent situation of domestic industry and the national economy, it was felt that it was necessary to convene the National Industry and Commerce Conference in advance. The reasons for this were prepared and submitted to the Executive Yuan, along with the proposed regulations and budget for approval. The Executive Yuan then proposed the regulations for approval at its 72nd meeting, and the budget was transferred to the Ministry of Finance for allocation.</p>
<p>(2) Promulgation of Regulations - After the convocation of the National Industry and Commerce Conference was approved by the Executive Yuan, the conference regulations and the Secretariat's regulations were drafted and promulgated by ministerial order.</p>
<p>(3) Expenses - The total budget for expenses was 9,920 yuan, including 520 yuan for salaries, 7,690 yuan for hospitality expenses, and 1,710 yuan for office expenses.</p>
<p>(4) Convening - On July 19th, telegrams were sent to the provincial governments and the municipal governments subordinate to the Executive Yuan, and notices were sent to the relevant ministries and commissions, requesting them to send representatives to attend on time.</p>
<p>(5) Appointment of Preparatory Personnel - Secretaries Zeng Kezhuan and Xu Lusheng, Technical Officers Xiong Chuanfei and Cai Xiang, Section Chiefs Wang Shinai, Chen Zhongsheng, Zhang Fengwu, Wang Zhong, Li Chongdian, and Fu Ganghou, and Clerks Shen Shiji and Wan Bang were appointed as preparatory personnel.</p>
<p>(6) Postponement - The original conference period was from September 16th to the 23rd of the same month. Later, after the telegrams were sent out, as of late August, the anti-rebellion military operations were in full swing, and transportation was disrupted. After checking the situation, it was found that it was difficult to hold the conference on time. Therefore, it was decided to postpone the conference from November 1st to the 8th of the same month. It was expected that two months later, the military operations would end, transportation would be restored, and representatives from all places would be able to attend on time. The reasons for the postponement were submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and approval, and documents were sent to the provinces and cities and the relevant ministries and commissions for reference, requesting them to send representatives and prepare proposals as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(7) Invitation of Domestic and Overseas Chinese Industrial and Commercial Leaders and Expert Members</p>
<p>Article 3 of the regulations originally stipulated that 20 to 30 domestic and overseas Chinese industrial and commercial leaders with prestige and 10 to 20 expert members should be selected and invited. As this conference is mainly focused on developing national industry and commerce, and relies heavily on the contributions of industrial and commercial leaders and professional scholars, the originally set number of people was too small. Therefore, the regulations were revised to indicate that the number of people in these two categories could be increased or decreased as appropriate according to the circumstances. Letters were immediately drafted to invite domestic and overseas Chinese industrial and commercial leaders and expert members. A total of 158 people in the two categories have been appointed.</p>
<p>(8) Establishment of the Secretariat - On October 6th, Zhang Yizhou, Director of the Ministry's Department of Commerce, was appointed as the Director of the Secretariat, and Section Chiefs Wang Shinai, Zhang Fengwu, Fu Ganghou, and Wang Zhong were appointed as Secretaries. The Secretariat was established on the same day and began to handle all daily affairs.</p>

<h3>Hu Wenhu's Opinion</h3>
<p>Letter to Minister Kong</p>
<p>| Please protect the interests of overseas Chinese |</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Committee Member Hu Wenhu was unable to attend the Industry and Commerce Conference due to his urgent return to Singapore. However, he had previously proposed two cases to promote transportation convenience between China and Southeast Asia and to send commercial commissioners. The letter he wrote to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Minister Yongzhi,</p>
<p>I recently received your instruction to invite me to be an overseas Chinese committee member of the Industry and Commerce Conference. I am very grateful and ashamed. Yesterday, I respectfully visited you and earnestly advised the overseas Chinese to cooperate with the domestic industrial and commercial circles. I was deeply impressed by your vision. However, I am deeply sorry that I will not be able to make some contributions with the domestic industrial and commercial leaders because I am about to return to Singapore. I have long been abroad and have seen that the domestic political situation is unstable and that all parties cannot truly cooperate. This is a cause for deep concern. I am also very saddened that overseas Chinese merchants inevitably have this kind of [Blank] bad phenomenon. I hope that all people in the country can engage in construction as directed by your Excellency, and then the final success of the national revolution can be expected. I will do my best to develop foreign trade, promote transportation convenience, and protect the interests of overseas Chinese. I hope that you will give me instructions in time. I hereby send my thanks and ask for your well-being. Respectfully,</p>
<p>Hu Wenhu, Committee Member of the Industry and Commerce Conference, October 24th</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Proposals</h3>
<p>Proposals from Ren Sida of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Proposals from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce: (1) "Proposal to concentrate national strength to develop overseas direct trade"; (2) "Proposal for domestic industrial and commercial cooperation"; (3) "Proposal to encourage the establishment of basic industries"; (4) "Proposal to realize labor-management cooperation"; (5) "Proposal to stipulate uniform standards for industrial products." In addition, economic expert Liu Huang [Blank] requested the government to implement a government-run banknote exchange method. Ren Sida also proposed a proposal to request the government to promote the organization of large-scale trading companies to revitalize foreign trade.</p>
<h3>Rationale for the Shanghai Machinery Association's Proposal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factories United Association has proposed at this Industrial and Commercial Conference convened by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that machine-made foreign-style goods be exempt from all tax levies and that raw material taxes be issued to maintain national goods. This has already been reported in the 23rd issue of this newspaper. Now, we submit a written rationale to Beijing as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Reasons why machine management and mass production are superior to manual labor:</p>
<p>In modern times, industry emphasizes mass production to sustain business. European and American factories utilize machinery to reduce manual labor. Recently, international labor organizations and entrepreneurs have been strongly advocating for the rationalization of industries as a good strategy to alleviate the current surge of labor unrest, promote industry, and maintain social stability. In the United States, factories like Henry Ford's not only have low operating costs but also high efficiency. Their most impressive achievement is machine management, not human management. Henry Ford's is the world's leading automobile company with the highest output, the lowest labor costs, and the cheapest prices. Other industries are gradually adopting this system to compete with global overproduction. The people of the United States are affluent, and every business venture starts with a large accumulation of capital. Once a company is announced to the public, the stocks are subscribed for in the morning and completed by the evening. From the above, it is easier to establish factories, and it is also easier to improve existing factories. On the other hand, in our country, machinery is not sophisticated, labor is wasted, and capital is weak, making improvements very difficult. Therefore, it is proposed to exempt all tax levies to maintain our country's production business. This is reason one.</p>
<p>(2) Reasons for abolishing tax levies to create division of labor and cooperation to compete with global industry:</p>
<p>Japan in the East is following the footsteps of Europe and America, implementing industrial and commercial protection policies, and adopting new policies, which has achieved good results. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan's exports have been increasing daily, and imported goods have been gradually decreasing due to tariff restrictions. The country has been tirelessly promoting and protecting production businesses. Therefore, although the lives of the Japanese people may not be as affluent as those of Europeans and Americans, due to the exemption of all tax levies, the people of that country can freely manufacture and sell goods. The industrial sector, aware of the global trend of mass production dominating the industrial landscape, leverages the government's protection policies to promote division of labor and cooperation, enabling precise techniques and minimal waste, thereby reducing costs and forming a chain-like mass production system to compete with the world. During the European War, countries suspended industrial activities to cope with the war. Propaganda leaflets and war materials were all supplied by Japan, indicating that chain-like mass production can not only alleviate the panic in the world market but also resist the invasion of mass production, promoting the foundation of its industrial nation. Our country's situation is similar to Japan's. To recover lost rights and compete in the world market, the government's protection policies are indispensable. It is proposed to exempt all tax levies to maintain our country's production business. This is reason two.</p>
<p>(3) Reasons why abolishing the flawed tax system will not affect government finances:</p>
<p>Some say that if all tax levies are exempted, there will be no source of government revenue. Now, let's take Britain, a major power, as an example. Britain is a barren land, lacking both agricultural products and manufactured goods. Its commerce is irrelevant. However, the British government strives for commercial development, drafting commercial regulations to eliminate disputes and establish commercial credit, and exempting all tax levies to develop its commerce. Whether domestic or in its overseas colonies, all are developed as free ports, achieving significant progress in a short period, unparalleled by any other country in the world. Although the national government does not have direct tax revenue to collect, the indirect taxes collected are not few. In comparison, they are even greater. Yet, it has not been heard that Britain has been deficient in government finances due to the exemption of all tax levies. From this, it can be seen that exempting all tax levies does not harm national tax revenue in the slightest but benefits our people. Therefore, it is proposed to exempt all tax levies to maintain our country's production business. This is reason three.</p>
<p>(4) Reasons why the heavy tax on Shaanxi cotton and the light tax on foreign cotton are hindering Shaanxi cotton and why tax levies should be abolished:</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, wars have been frequent, and provinces have governed themselves, with frequent arbitrary taxes and levies, causing merchants to lose their livelihoods, goods to be hindered, and merchants to complain. They say that the heavy burden of taxes and levies is even worse than the Qing Dynasty. Anyone with blood in their veins is filled with righteous indignation and thinks of ways to alleviate the situation. Now that the war is over, peace is in sight, and unification is expected, it is hoped that this Industrial and Commercial Conference will solve the deformed tax system. Otherwise, if things continue like this for decades, China will not be spared from ruin. Now, let's take an example to illustrate this. Shaanxi cotton, which uses foreign cotton seeds, produces fibers that are as long and strong as American cotton, and the price is comparable to lower-grade American cotton. However, due to the heavy tax burden, people abandon Shaanxi cotton and use foreign cotton. Isn't this a tragedy? According to the survey conducted by the National Yarn Factories United Association's Textile Times, the tax burden on each picul of Shaanxi cotton from Shaanxi to Zhengzhou is as high as nine yuan, not including the taxes from Zhengzhou to Hankou to Shanghai. According to the actual situation of cotton demand, the cotton is mostly used in Shanghai. If taxes are levied repeatedly at every step, the price of Shaanxi cotton will be much higher than that of Indian cotton and American cotton. Therefore, Shanghai factories would rather use American cotton than Shaanxi cotton. Here is an analysis of the tax burden per picul: "Shaanxi Likin" one yuan per picul, "Shaanzhou Cotton Tax" seven dimes per picul, "Shaanxi Education Surcharge" eight dimes per picul, "Shaanzhou Likin" eight dimes per picul, "Tongguan Cotton Tax" one yuan per picul, "Shaanzhou Defense Surcharge" one yuan per picul, "Tongguan Regular Customs Tax" eight dimes per picul, "Shaanzhou Military Surcharge" eight dimes per picul, "Tongguan Commercial Tax" three dimes per picul, "Shaanzhou Special Fee" one yuan and five dimes per picul, "Tongguan Police Surcharge" three dimes per picul, totaling nine yuan per picul.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that to achieve the circulation of agricultural products, the development of industrial products everywhere, and the revitalization of the national goods market, the first step is to abolish tax levies. Therefore, it is proposed to exempt all tax levies to maintain our country's production business and promote the development of national goods.</p>

<h3>Discussion on Entertainment Plans for the National Calendar New Year</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Convened a Discussion</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating that Article 1 of the central government's regulations on promoting the National Calendar stipulates that the dates for shifting the New Year holiday and various ceremonies, decorations, and entertainment from the abolished lunar calendar to the National Calendar New Year should be actively implemented by party and government organs. As the end of the year is approaching and the people's accumulated habits are still deep-rooted, if reforms are not made early, it is feared that they may not be fully implemented, hindering the implementation of the National Calendar. A request has been submitted to the Municipal Government to send personnel to convene a meeting with all parties to preside over the matter. It has been ordered that this Bureau take charge of the matter and prepare accordingly. Therefore, a meeting will be held at this Bureau at 3:00 PM on November 3 to discuss the implementation plan. Please send two responsible representatives to attend on time. It is heard that the Chamber of Commerce has assigned Chief Secretary Zheng Chengqing to attend and participate in the discussion.</p>
<h3>The Overseas Chinese Federation Requests the Municipal Party Headquarters to Convene a General Assembly of All Sectors Again</h3>
<p>To Discuss Measures to Resist the Java Company</p>
<p>To Organize a Diplomatic Support Association for the Netherlands</p>
<p>Lists Seven Reasons and Detailed Facts</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Association of the Overseas Chinese Federation sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, in our previous letter, we requested that your department convene all party departments, organizations, newspapers, and schools to organize a Diplomatic Support Association for the Netherlands to resolve the case of Ms. Xiao Xin'an being sexually assaulted by the second and first officers of the Java Shipping Company's ship 'Zibaad', as well as the Dutch government's abuse of Overseas Chinese, imposing heavy taxes, prohibiting the reading of the Three Principles of the People, prohibiting the holding of Memorial Week for the Premier, arbitrarily expelling party members and teachers, and massacring merchants, workers, and laborers. We trust that you have considered it. Now, the 'Zibaad' ship is about to arrive in Shanghai, and the animalistic second and first officers are still on board, waiting for Chinese women to be sexually assaulted for the second time. If a general assembly is not convened promptly to decide on countermeasures, the two hundred million female compatriots will inevitably fall into the trap again. The animalistic second and first officers will increasingly indulge their animalistic desires and play with and defile the national honor, bringing shame to humanity. If we do not fight against this, what face do we have? Therefore, the Association suggests organizing a Diplomatic Support Association for the Netherlands, and we respectfully present the reasons to your department for your consideration: (1) Article 109 of the regulations in the Dutch territories stipulates that Chinese people assimilated into 'Sipans' are not equal to Japanese and other Europeans. The Dutch regard 'Sipans' as slaves and livestock, and 'Sipan' women are treated as maids or temporary sex objects. Those with better looks are often abducted by the scum of the Dutch. The animalistic second and first officers regarded Ms. Xiao as a 'Sipan' woman and dared to repeatedly force themselves on her. Therefore, while thoroughly assisting the Xiao case, we must also request the government to seriously negotiate with the Dutch government to amend Article 109 of the Dutch territories' regulations, recognizing that Chinese people are equal to Japanese and Europeans; otherwise, our country will also regard Dutch envoys, consuls, and their overseas Chinese as inferior people who cannot receive most-favored-nation treatment, and the boycott of the Java Shipping Company will not stop. (2) The Netherlands has a population of only over five million and is not worthy of being an imperialist power, but its government's abuse of Overseas Chinese is even more severe than that of other imperialist powers, such as prohibiting the reading of the Three Principles of the People textbooks and prohibiting the holding of Memorial Week for the Premier. Its insult to our Premier and our party and country is unbearable for those who love the party and the country. Therefore, taking advantage of the momentum of assisting the Xiao case, we should request the government to seriously negotiate with the Dutch government to abolish the aforementioned prohibitions; otherwise, our country should also restrict the freedom of thought and belief of Dutch overseas Chinese in China, and the boycott of the Java Shipping Company</p>
<p>will not stop. (3) The Dutch East Indies once submitted to our country. Overseas Chinese have been migrating there for over a thousand years, with a population of over three million. When Chinese people first migrated to the Dutch territories, there was no entry tax. The entry tax was first levied in the first year of the Republic of China, at 25 guilders per person. Later, it was increased to 50 guilders due to successful collection, and still no protests were made. Then, it was increased to 100 guilders. It is estimated that Overseas Chinese have paid about one million yuan in this tax since it was first levied. Last year, the Dutch Colonial Council resolved to increase it again to 150 guilders starting from July 1992. Lin Youren and other citizens residing in Beijing petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest, which was delayed. In June of this year, the Colonial Council resubmitted the old proposal and resolved to implement the increase in the entry tax to 150 guilders per person starting from 1931. If this continues to increase, the losses of Overseas Chinese will be enormous. We should simultaneously request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to telegraph the relevant envoys and consuls to jointly protest with the envoys and consuls of Japan and other friendly countries with deeper relations with the Dutch territories. On the one hand, we should contact the local Overseas Chinese to ask the Overseas Chinese members of the council to find ways to salvage the situation and persuade other members to express their sympathy. Furthermore, we should detail the reasons why it is absolutely impossible to increase again and again to the Dutch Governor, publish them in Chinese, English, Dutch, and Malay newspapers, and persuade Overseas Chinese organizations to petition the Dutch government together, and declare in the notification to the Dutch government, the Dutch territories government, and the Dutch envoy in China, "If this resolution is not revoked, then China, in order to seek equality, will also levy the same amount of entry tax on Dutch people coming to China." The public will also not stop boycotting the Java Shipping Company. (4) Countless Overseas Chinese in the Dutch territories have been brutally massacred. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, over ten thousand people were killed in Bapa for resisting the poll tax. The river water was dyed red with the blood of Overseas Chinese, hence the Red River of Batavia. Since the founding of the Republic of China, in various ports such as 'Lasen', 'Jambi', 'Sewah', 'Ventungan', 'Kampung Melayu', 'Kudus', 'Singkawang', 'Mendiri', and 'Sambas' (there are many others that have not been investigated in detail), Overseas Chinese have been either harmed by natives or slaughtered by Dutch soldiers. Life is cheaper than ants, and property is plundered at will. We should simultaneously request the government to earnestly negotiate to achieve the purpose of punishing the murderers and compensating for the lives lost; otherwise, Dutch overseas Chinese in China cannot hold us accountable for protecting the people. The boycott of the Java Shipping Company will not stop. (5) The Dutch government vigorously implements a policy of fooling the people, regarding Chinese schools as thorns and Chinese newspapers as enemies. Educators, journalists, and members of the Party's Executive and Supervisory Committees are arbitrarily persecuted, imprisoned, and even government officials of our country are subjected to their arrest and humiliation, which can be described as extremely unreasonable. We hereby list what we know as follows. There may be omissions: Tian Tong, Xiong Li, Jun Lu, Zhu Youguang, Zhao Hai, Xie Zuomin, Zhong Gongren, Wu Gongfu, Wu Xinhui, Wei Tianyu, Chen Meian, Chen Xiexun, Qin Huanzheng, Zhang Zhaohong, Yu Junxian, Zhong Zuoheng, Chen Zhiming, Xiao Xianjiao, Cen Julin, Zheng Qianhuai, Yan Xiangqing, Zhong Yingqiu, Jing Yanru, Jing Duohui, Lin Hongwan, Xi Qibaogong, Liao Peizhi, Wang Benshan, Guo Hengjie, Lin Ming. If we want to truly implement the Overseas Chinese policy, we must raise the negotiation. In the future, no one should be imprisoned or expelled without evidence of a crime and after a lawful trial. If the Dutch are still unreasonable, our country should treat Dutch overseas Chinese in the same way that the Dutch treat Chinese overseas Chinese, and the boycott of the Java Shipping Company will not stop. (6) The traitor Lu Zhengxiang, who signed the Twenty-One Demands, signed an unequal Sino-Dutch consular treaty with the Netherlands in the third year of the Xuantong era, stipulating that our consuls are commercial affairs officials who protect the commerce of their own people. Therefore, the education, journalism, agriculture, and labor sectors cannot receive consular protection. It is also stipulated that our consuls have no diplomatic nature, so they sit idly by as overseas Chinese are abused and killed, and they dare not negotiate. What is even more absurd is that a separate exchange of notes is attached to the consular treaty, acknowledging that any ambiguities arising from the words 'Dutch citizens' and 'Chinese citizens' in the treaty can be resolved in accordance with the current laws in the territory of the Dutch territories, selling the hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese who were born in the Dutch territories to the Dutch and turning them into Dutch colonial subjects, and forfeiting all their hundreds of millions of assets. This is truly the intention of the Dutch overseas Chinese to notify the Dutch envoy and declare that the old treaty should be renewed when it expires, and to order all levels of party departments to hold a 'Week for the Abolition of the Dutch Treaty'. Because the Dutch government has no sincerity, the new treaty has not been agreed upon. We should urgently request the government to formally announce the abolition of the consular treaty and set a deadline for renegotiation, stipulating that Chinese consuls are the protectors of their own nationals within their jurisdiction and may handle all negotiations concerning overseas Chinese at any time, and adding the clause 'Children born to Chinese overseas Chinese in the Dutch territories will always be recognized as Chinese citizens'. If the Dutch government delays in revising it, our people will not stop boycotting the Java Shipping Company. (7) Dutch officials deliberately abuse overseas Chinese, imposing arbitrary taxes and penalties on those who have already entered the country, and detaining those who have just arrived at the detention center first, not allowing old customers to legally guarantee relatives and friends at any time, not allowing meetings, not allowing food to be sent, and letting them go without food all day and without sleep all night. Since the language cannot be communicated, defecation is also free. Many weak women and children become ill and die as a result. The treatment is more cruel than that of prisoners. The inspection is so strict that women are turned away. Japanese or Europeans arriving on the same ship are treated with ease and without hindrance. How can this be tolerated by comparing them? We should urgently request the government to negotiate for improvement; otherwise, our country should also abuse Dutch overseas Chinese who enter the country in the same way. The public will also not stop the boycott of Java Shipping Company. The above-mentioned are the reasons for the Association to suggest organizing a diplomatic support association for the Netherlands, which is also a method to expand the Xiao case to save overseas Chinese and avenge grievances. Whether or not it is appropriate depends entirely on your judgment. However, the beast ship Gebad is about to arrive in Shanghai, and the people are indignant at the beast ship and the Java Company to which it belongs, and the enthusiasm for the boycott is high. Can the shortest period of time be convened by your department to preside over a public meeting of all party departments, organizations, newspapers, and schools in the city to resolve everything, and also inform the Association representatives Xu Jigong and Lin Youren, so that they can reply in advance to all Overseas Chinese groups who are concerned about the Xiao case overseas, which is especially fortunate. This is the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation Representative Chairman Xu Jigong respectfully.</p>
<h3>Historical Basis for the Nationalization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Talks by Li Zhonggong</p>
<p>The nature of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has now been nationalized by the government. The official order was issued yesterday. It is generally known that this is an inevitable measure taken by the government based on its political program. However, it is not known that the company has actually been operated by the government in history. Mr. Li Zhonggong, the director of the company, specially issued a historical basis for the nationalization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday, analyzing this point in detail. The narration is as follows:</p>
<h3>The Establishment of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Was Originally Funded by the Government</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Treaty Ports, foreign sailing ships have prevailed. The nation's own sandboats can't compete with the steamships that have taken over more and more territory. The old-style shipping merchants completely failed. Wealthy merchants, in full view of the steamships' wide and steady speed with their capacity for profits, there were those who bought steamships and sailed between ports to transport and trade goods. However, because foreign merchants had superior wealth and power, they all attached themselves to them. All national shipping generally flew foreign flags. At that time, Li Hongzhang, the governor-general of Zhili, realized this and, in September of the eleventh year of Tongzhi, received the approval of the Qing court to establish a commercial bureau to receive the steamships of various merchants into the official bureau. He was also approved to borrow 200,000 strings of cash from the Ministry of Revenue, following the regulations for levying funds to train troops and from the pawnshops of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, to be used as official capital for the establishment. On the fifth day of the tenth month of the same year, the governor-general of Zhili and the governor of Jiangsu also received approval to allocate 200,000 shi of grain for transport by the commercial bureau. As a result, with both official capital and grain transport, the foundation for establishment was stabilized. Li Hongzhang then sent Zhu Qiong back to Shanghai to establish the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. It was established on the nineteenth day of the twelfth month of that year. That day happened to be the date of the Lunar New Year holiday, so the opening date was backdated to the sixteenth day to transport tribute rice in the spring. The circumstances of the establishment of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the true meaning of its name are clearly those of a bureau established by the government.</p>
<h3>The China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company's Sustenance and Development Entirely Due to Official Funds and Government Support</h3>
<p>At that time, although the China Merchants' Bureau was established, most merchants who owned steamships were hesitant to move forward. Only the bureau itself purchased three steamships named Yidun, Yongqing, and Fuxing. Therefore, in May of the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign (1873), Li Hongzhang appointed Tang Tingshu to the bureau to revise the regulations and widely solicit shares. In June, he also issued a decree appointing him as the General Manager. Not long after, he successively appointed Sheng Xuanhuai to assist Xu Run in jointly managing the work, including soliciting shares, building wharves, and soliciting cargo. Zhu Qiong was responsible for managing the grain transport affairs. The division of labor and cooperation gradually formed an image of the government being the main body and the merchants being the auxiliary. However, the commercial shares solicited at that time only amounted to 476,000 taels of capital by the end of June of the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign. Then, it was proposed to solicit new shares at 100 taels per share.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>However, by the end of June of the third year of the Guangxu reign (1877), only 730,200 taels of capital had been collected. After five years, the results of the share solicitation were still so meager. It was already difficult to maintain operations with this financial strength, let alone develop. However, during these five years, the situation and business of the bureau developed vigorously, and the equipment advanced rapidly. By the second year of the Guangxu reign (1876), the bureau had already reached eleven steamships. In the winter of that year, it acquired the American-owned Russell &amp; Co. steamship company, adding sixteen steamships, thus opening the road to the future development of the bureau. The price of the acquisition of Russell &amp; Co. was 2 million taels. Considering that the commercial shares were only a meager 600,000 taels, the difference was vast, and it was ultimately necessary for the government to raise funds to assist. The various undertakings of the bureau during this period, which were successful due to the support of official funds and government power, can be described as follows: (A) The substantial profits from the exclusive transport of grain tribute and official goods. The bureau, with its meager capital, was able to obtain substantial profits in addition to maintaining expenses, which was used to add ships, build wharves, and compete. This was truly due to the profitable source of grain transport water freight. A budget proposal submitted by Xu Run, the co-manager, is sufficient to illustrate this point: "…Currently, based on a capital of 500,000 taels, we are conducting trial operations. Each ship's monthly expenses are 5,000 taels, and the monthly expenses for four ships are 20,000 taels. The water freight obtained is 5 qian and 1 fen of silver per stone of grain tribute. After deducting 95% for the grain tribute and 95% for the bureau's expenses, the actual profit is 132,500 taels of silver. Each time, additional passengers and goods can earn at least 1,500 taels. Calculated over three months, the net profit can be 108,000 taels of silver…" This proposal was submitted in the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign and only calculated for 300,000 stones of grain tribute. In three months, a net profit of 108,000 taels could already be obtained. Later, the grain transport increased several times, and the profit also increased accordingly. Moreover, in the third year of the Guangxu reign, the bureau's ships increased due to the acquisition of Russell &amp; Co. Li Hongzhang feared that the grain transport alone would not be sufficient to supply, so he also奏明 that official goods from various provinces should be entrusted to the bureau for transport. Since then, the bureau's freight transport has never lacked cargo, and the benefits have been even greater than the grain transport. Therefore, although Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire lowered prices and competed for five years, the bureau, relying on government support, did not reduce prices for grain tribute, tea, or other goods. Customs inspections were facilitated, and business was not slightly damaged. Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire finally compromised and agreed to a uniform price agreement. This is one example of the China Merchants' Bureau relying on government support. (B) In the early days of the bureau, there was a lack of steamships. In December of the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign, Zhejiang Province allocated one Fubo steamship for grain transport. In the thirteenth year, the Fujian Shipyard allocated one Haijing steamship. In October of the first year of the Guangxu reign, the Jiangsu Treasury allocated 100,000 taels of silver to build two steamships, Jiangkuan and Jiangyong. In the second year, it received one Hanguang steamship for Qingbei River defense. The bureau directly obtained a total of five ships from the state. In the early days of the bureau, the entire bureau had only eleven ships, and the state accounted for nearly half. This is two example of the China Merchants' Bureau relying on government support. (C) Although the initial capital of the bureau was small, the scale was grand. Therefore, although business profits increased with government assistance and expanded day and night, the turnover was strained. Therefore, the only way to meet urgent needs was to rely on official funds. In the second year of the Guangxu reign, foreign merchants competed, and passenger and cargo traffic decreased slightly. Li Hongzhang, fearing that it would not be able to support itself, allocated 500,000 taels of official funds as a deposit in the bureau to maintain operations. In the seventh year of the Guangxu reign, Sheng Xuanhuai expelled Xu Run from office, and various households in the bureau successively withdrew funds. Li Hongzhang again allocated 360,000 taels of official funds from his position as the Governor-General of Zhili to support the critical situation. This is three example of the China Merchants' Bureau relying entirely on official funds to maintain operations in times of crisis. (D) The acquisition of Russell &amp; Co. was the biggest key to the development of the China Merchants' Bureau. All the expansion of ships and the superiority of today's wharves and real estate are based on this move. In the second year of the Guangxu reign, when the agreement to acquire the company was negotiated, the price was set at 2 million taels, while the total capital of the China Merchants' Bureau, both official and commercial, was only over 1 million. Fortunately, Li Hongzhang and Shen Baozhen, the Governor-General of Liangjiang,奏明 that the Ningbo Customs should allocate 100,000 taels, the Jiang'an Customs and the Jianghai Customs should each allocate 200,000 taels, Zhejiang and Jiangxi should each allocate 200,000 taels, and Hubei should allocate 100,000 taels, totaling 1 million. The acquisition of Russell &amp; Co. was thus realized, becoming the largest shipping company in the country. At that time, it even surpassed Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire. (At that time, Jardine Matheson only had eight ships, Butterfield &amp; Swire only had six ships, and the China Merchants' Bureau had a total of twenty-six ships, both new and old. It was truly the leader in the shipping industry for a time.) This is four example of the China Merchants' Bureau relying entirely on official funds to develop. (E) The total amount of official funds received by the China Merchants' Bureau before and after was more than 2.15 million taels. If such a large amount of official funds, several times the capital, had to be repaid annually with principal and interest, its financial strength would definitely not be able to bear it. Therefore, Li Hongzhang devised a method to delay repayment. Initially, foreign loans were repaid first, and official loans were repaid later. Later, official loans were exempted from interest and only the principal was repaid. The official funds were used as capital to obtain business profits, and then the surplus was used to repay the official capital. Therefore, although the official funds had been repaid by the twentieth year of the Guangxu reign (1894), the public reserve fund in the bureau had already exceeded 2 million. However, the fact that 2 million was withdrawn from the public reserve in the twenty-third year (1897) to fill up the stocks can be taken as solid evidence. All the profits were obtained by borrowing official capital. This is five example of the China Merchants' Bureau relying on government support to obtain official profits to repay official capital. In summary, the following points regarding the relationship between the China Merchants' Bureau and the Qing government can be obtained: (1) The establishment relied entirely on the government's allocation of 200,000 strings of silver from the training salaries and minting money. (2) The business relied entirely on the exclusive transport of grain tribute, official goods, hats, and tea as the foundation. (3) The turnover relied entirely on official funds for emergency maintenance. (4) The expansion relied entirely on the government's allocation of 1 million to assist in the acquisition of Russell &amp; Co. (5) Half of the total number of steamships were purchased with official funds. (6) The repayment of water freight was gradually repaid with the profits obtained from official funds. Therefore, based on the facts of the bureau's operations at that time, it was purely based on official capital as the main body and commercial shares as the auxiliary. The meaning of the name "China Merchants" was obviously fortunate. Because the newly emerging business was profitable, those powerful people borrowed the name of commercial management to seize profits. If unfortunately, there was a loss, the official capital would be lost, and no one would admit to commercial management and repay it. However, in recent years, there have been selfish people who have been talking about the source being commercial management. Looking at this inside story, one should be aware of it. I still remember that Li Guojie, the former chairman of the board of directors, said in a report to the Ministry of Communications in the eleventh year (1885): "Looking back at the beginning of the bureau's establishment, although it was managed by merchants who raised shares, everything relied on the Northern Ocean's allocation of grain tribute to供 提借 official funds to資 turnover. When dealing with foreign merchants and local affairs, it would maintain impartiality and主 to achieve victory." In January of the seventeenth year (1891), a secret report to Supervisor Wang stated: "In the past, my late father, Wen Zhonggong (i.e., Li Hongzhang), founded the China Merchants...毅然 by the Northern and Southern Oceans successively allocated and borrowed more than 2 million in official funds to help the China Merchants' Bureau succeed. At that time, commercial shares were not enthusiastic, and official shares accounted for the majority." This is a precise论 on the relationship between officials and the China Merchants' Bureau.</p>
<p>From the time the China Merchants' Bureau was established until the Xuantong reign (1909-1911), it was managed by government officials. After Li Hongzhang appointed Zhu Qiong to create the bureau, the general managers or directors who took office successively were all appointed by the Governor-General of Beiyang, including Tang Tingshu, Xu Run, Sheng Xuanhuai, etc., who were all appointed by Li. In the twenty-ninth year of the Guangxu reign (1903), Yuan Shikai succeeded as the Governor-General of Beiyang and continued the old practice, first appointing Yang Shiqi as the general manager and Xu Run as the director. In the first year of the Xuantong reign (1909), Sheng Xuanhuai served as the Minister of Posts and Communications and transferred the bureau to the management of the ministry. In that year, the ministry appointed Zhong Wenyao as the director and Wang Cunshan as the director. The successive appointments are clearly documented and sufficient to prove that it was managed by officials.</p>
<p>The transformation of the China Merchants' Bureau from official management to commercial management was the result of powerful people seeking personal gain. Sheng Xuanhuai was a person managed by the Northern Ocean. In the seventh year of the Guangxu reign (1881), he expelled Xu Run from the bureau, causing the stock price to fall. He then took the opportunity to buy up a large number of shares, which is how he started. Later, he transferred the public reserve fund, which was obtained by relying on official capital, to issue stocks and gradually repay the official capital. Thus, the commercial shares increased from 1 million to 4.4 million. In the first year of the Xuantong reign (1909), Sheng relied on his power as the Minister of Posts and Communications to request that the regulations for the commercial management of the China Merchants' Bureau be promulgated and implemented. Therefore, the transformation of the China Merchants' Bureau from official management to commercial management was entirely created by Sheng alone, and the Sheng family accounted for one-third of all the shares. He secretly manipulated the situation, and the words "commercial management" were only used to deceive the Qing court. In reality, it was completely for personal gain.</p>
<p>The true situation of the China Merchants' Bureau's prosperity under official management and decline under commercial management: (A) At the beginning of the establishment, the use of personnel and administration were entirely managed by officials. Tang Tingshu and Xu Run were appointed by the Northern Ocean and loyally built the bureau. In terms of construction, they added ships, built warehouses and docks, and made progress every year. In four years, they built more than ten ships themselves, and docks and warehouses were located in various ports along the Yangtze River and the sea. In the fourth year, they acquired Russell &amp; Co., and the foundation was stabilized. In terms of shipping, they successively opened the Yangtze River line, the Shanghai-Ningbo line, the Northern and Southern Ocean lines, and expanded to Korea, Japan, Singapore, Penang, Java, the Western 海防, and Honolulu. The farthest even reached England and San Francisco in the United States for a time. At that time, the atmosphere was prosperous, and it seemed that there was a tendency to advance a thousand miles in one day, breaking the monopoly of foreign steamships in the shipping industry. The people and industries of the whole country benefited from it. Compared with the later period of commercial management, when the ships were 敝, the shipping lines were short, and foreign steamships were increasingly oppressive, the feeling of prosperity and decline cannot be compared on the same day. (B) After Sheng Xuanhuai entered the bureau for the second time, he planned to change it to commercial management and private ownership. He擅挪 more than 2 million from the public reserve for other purposes and did not increase ships or open new lines. The momentum of the shipping industry gradually declined. In the first year of the Xuantong reign (1909), commercial management was realized. In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), the board of directors was established, and the affairs of the Commercial Bureau were completely controlled by a few shareholder businessmen. 一任 profit was削 and无 one could 加过 ask. The Bureau's affairs declined in disaster. There was an annual折 and years of debt. What is even more heartbreaking is that, during the European War, many foreign ships returned to their countries to listen to the deployment, and the price per ton increased dramatically. The Bureau was able to dominate the country, and it was possible to seize this great opportunity to vigorously develop, and it was not difficult to push over foreign ships. However, Japanese shipping has leaped forward at that time, from 1.7 million tons to 4 million tons. The board of directors of the Bureau only want to embezzle and were unwilling to expand, and even transfer the Bureau's ships to others for business, earning余聊 to enjoy themselves. Therefore, although the board of directors has won several bonuses in these years, the business equipment has not increased by a single point, and the debt burden in the Bureau has not been减. Therefore, the commercial board of directors at that time was 百喙 difficult to justify. This kind of success in official management and failure in commercial management is obvious and must not be饰者. In the past history of the China Merchants Bureau, from the creation, maintenance, expansion, and development, it was得力于 the support of the government. At this time, the statement that the nationalization is to return it to its original form. Therefore, this time, the national government decided to return to national ownership. On the one hand, it is based on the doctrine of the political program, and on the other hand, it is in line with the development of the China Merchants Bureau in the past and the needs of future facts.

<h3>A Woman's Sudden Death Almost Becomes a Miscarriage of Justice</h3>
<p>Two Autopsy Reports</p>
<p>With Completely Different Wordings</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Judge Investigated and Clarified</p>
<p>Qian Acai Acquitted</p>
<p>Qian Acai, a resident of No. 776 Yangshupu Road from Ningbo, married Xuan Axiang, who was nineteen years old. The couple were known to be harmonious. On the evening of September 18th of this year, they suddenly had an argument over a minor matter. Qian, in anger, repeatedly slapped Xuan's face. It was already past midnight. After being humiliated by her husband, Xuan went out of the bedroom and sat alone at a large table in the parlor, where she fell asleep. The next morning, Qian saw that his wife was still not awake. He called out to her but received no response. He shook her body, but she suddenly collapsed to the ground, appearing to be in a faint. He intended to send her to the hospital for treatment, but she had already passed away. The matter was reported to the Huishan Police Station in charge, who sent detectives to take Xuan's body to the autopsy room on Faelun Road. At the same time, they reported to the Special District Court for an autopsy. Before the establishment of the Special District Court, autopsies in the concession were usually handled by Western doctors from the Municipal Council Hospital. Since the establishment of the Special Court and the establishment of a forensic autopsy department, all autopsy matters have been handled by the forensic doctor hired by the Special Court, instead of Western doctors from the Municipal Council Hospital. This has been the practice for several months and has been effective. Therefore, Xuan's remains were still examined by a forensic doctor along with Prosecutor Xu at the autopsy room according to the law. That day, when the forensic doctor began the autopsy in the autopsy room, Prosecutor Xu first summoned witnesses for questioning. As the questioning was about to conclude, the forensic doctor's autopsy report had not yet been submitted. An order was given to an official to inquire, and a report was finally submitted. The report stated that the deceased's neck had strangulation marks with subcutaneous hemorrhage. The heart, liver, and stomach in the abdomen all had purplish blood clots. It was presumed that the deceased was first pushed onto the bed and then strangled with a cloth, causing her to suffocate to death. Prosecutor Xu, based on the forensic doctor's report, ordered the family of the deceased to make a statement and collect the body for burial. The Municipal Council, based on the report, filed a lawsuit against Qian Acai, citing Article 284 of the Criminal Law, requesting that the defendant be punished with the death penalty for premeditated murder. This case was heard by Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Court. After Judge Feng repeatedly held hearings, summoned witnesses, brought in the defendant for interrogation, and heard arguments from both sides' lawyers, the case was ready for sentencing. However, Judge Feng, after carefully reviewing the entire case, felt there were suspicious points and believed that further investigation of evidence and another round of debate were necessary. At this time, the original forensic doctor suddenly submitted another autopsy report. The content of this report was completely different from the previous report. It stated that the deceased's heart, liver, and stomach in the abdomen had no purplish blood or undigested food. However, examination of the intestines and stomach revealed 25% morphine and a very high percentage of opium. The cause of death was likely poisoning. What was even more strange was that this report was signed by Dr. Wagner, a chemical autopsy doctor from the Municipal Council. Judge Feng paid great attention to this report and promptly scheduled a notice to both lawyers, summoned witnesses, and reopened the debate. When the verbal debate concluded, Judge Feng presented the second autopsy report to the prosecuting lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, the representative of the police station, and asked if Mr. Zhang had seen this report at the Municipal Council. It was customary for the Municipal Council's Western doctors to prepare two copies of the report for each autopsy: one to be submitted to the court for record and one to be sent to the Municipal Council's handling police station for preservation and investigation. At that time, lawyer Zhang said he had not seen the report. He requested a postponement of the case to investigate at the police station. Judge Feng granted the request and postponed the hearing to October 29th. The second report was also investigated and clarified by lawyer Zhang. After adjourning that day, Zhang returned to the Municipal Council's legal department and the Huishan Police Station in charge of the case to inquire, but both claimed they had not seen the report. Then he went to Dr. Wagner, who signed the report, to inquire about everything. Dr. Wagner told him that his autopsy of the body was at the request of a forensic doctor from the court. After the autopsy was completed, he should prepare a report specifically for the forensic doctor. Because it was not the Municipal Council that requested his autopsy, he did not need to give another report to the Municipal Council. It was then that he realized that the forensic doctor had examined the body for a long time but could not determine the cause of death. The forensic doctor originally wanted to wait for Dr. Wagner's report to be clear before submitting his own. However, Dr. Wagner's chemical autopsy took time, and the forensic doctor, impatient, submitted a report based on his own findings to fulfill his responsibility, leading to this error. After Judge Feng had investigated the case thoroughly, he announced the verdict on the 29th:</p>
<p>Qian Acai is not guilty and should be released. Furthermore, during the time between the reopening of the debate and the lawyer's request for a postponement, the forensic doctor specially made a correction and prepared a third autopsy report, stating that the deceased did indeed die of poisoning, but after taking the poison, she fell onto the bed, and her chest hit the edge of the bed, causing her to suffocate to death.</p>
<h3>Is Hu Fuzhang Really Mentally Ill?</h3>
<p>Conflicting Autopsy Reports</p>
<p>Police Station Requests Proof</p>
<p>The autopsy report prepared by a forensic doctor from the Special District Ye's Court on the body of Qian Xuan was completely contradictory to the autopsy report of the Municipal Council Western doctor Wagner. After this case, another case of contradictory reports from Chinese and Western doctors occurred yesterday. It is truly a rare and unprecedented event. The case that occurred yesterday involved Hu Fuzhang, the son of Hu Aji, a Chinese detective and third-in-charge of the Hongkou Police Station. Hu Fuzhang suddenly attempted to kill his biological mother, Hu Ma, on September 30th, and was arrested by the police and sent to the Special District Court. During the second hearing, Hu Aji and his younger brother were present in court and stated that Hu Fuzhang had a history of mental illness. Judge Wu Tingqi ruled that the case should be reviewed after an autopsy. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu opened the hearing again. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the defendant Hu Fuzhang had been sent to the Municipal Council Hospital and examined by a Western doctor, who found no signs of mental illness. Furthermore, he stayed in the hospital for several days without any unusual behavior. Therefore, it can be concluded that he has no mental illness. At that time, Judge Wu handed the forensic report from Special Court to the police lawyer for review. The report was written by a forensic doctor and contained lengthy and detailed information about Hu Fuzhang's childhood illnesses. According to the report, Hu fell in school when he was young and later contracted syphilis and became addicted to opium. Recently, he suffered from mental illness. After reading the report, the police lawyer pointed out that the forensic doctor handled this case in the same way as the Qian Xuan case. What was most strange was how the forensic doctor knew about Hu Fuzhang's childhood. He requested that the court postpone the case and order the forensic doctor to appear in court at the next hearing to prove the points mentioned in the report. Judge Wu then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Kong Wusheng Transferred to the Higher Branch Court</h3>
<p>Yuan Liang, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, suspected that Kong Wusheng, a Zhejiang native with the address of No. 100 Carter Road, Public Concession, was a communist. Therefore, he sent detectives to cooperate with the Chinese and Western detectives of the Xinzha Police Station to arrest Kong and send him to the Special District Court. After two preliminary trials, the judge ordered Kong to be detained while evidence was collected from the Public Security Bureau for further review. As reported in this newspaper yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi of the Special Court took the stand to continue the trial in the Second Criminal Court. The issue of jurisdiction arose. Judge Wu first informed the defendant Kong Wusheng that the Public Security Bureau had submitted a detailed document regarding meetings, etc. The defendant replied that he had not attended any meetings or distributed leaflets. The police lawyer, Wei Yin and Wang Yaotang, stood up and requested that the document be released for review. Judge Wu approved. After reviewing the document, lawyer Wei stated that the location and date of the meeting were not clear in the Public Security Bureau's document. Moreover, the first paragraph only stated that the defendant was a communist. Therefore, the evidence was still insufficient. If the meeting place belonged to the concession, then this court had the right to jurisdiction. The court should accept the case. Judge Wu then declared that this case was initiated by the Public Security Bureau requesting assistance in arresting the defendant. According to Article 6 of the agreement, cases involving assistance should be investigated by the court and then transferred to a court outside the concession for trial. Lawyer Wang further stated that the location of the crime was in the concession. Thus it was not necessary to transfer the case. Article 6 of the agreement states, "If someone commits a crime in the mainland and flees to the concession, and the Public Security Bureau or the Garrison Command requests the concession to assist in the arrest," then they should be transferred. The current case is the opposite. According to the Public Security Bureau's document, the location of the crime was in Kunshan Garden. Kunshan Garden belongs to the concession. Therefore, there is no need to transfer the case. Moreover, the police station still needs to investigate the evidence provided by the Public Security Bureau. If it is true, then the defendant should be transferred to the Higher Branch Court, and the police station will file a lawsuit. There is a similar case in the Higher Branch Court, another defendant, Shen Zongyong, was also accused of being a communist, and the mainland authorities requested his transfer, but the issue has not been resolved. The police station has submitted a written request to the Higher Branch Court to forward to the Supreme Court for interpretation. The reply has not yet been received. The Higher Branch Court has ordered the defendant Shen Zongyong to be released on bail pending further instructions. Judge Wu reviewed the report and ruled that the police lawyer's request to transfer Kong Wusheng, who is suspected of being a reactionary, to the Higher Branch Court for formal prosecution should be approved. Kong should be remanded in custody temporarily.</p>
<h3>Yuan Shunwu Struggles with Kidnappers</h3>
<p>All Kidnappers Fail</p>
<p>Treated Very Well in the Den</p>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly reported on the details of Yuan Shunwu, a student from Hubei at Datong University, who was kidnapped and escaped danger. Yesterday, this reporter happened to meet an official handling the case on the road and inquired about the process of solving the case. According to him, the details have already been fully reported in this newspaper, but there are still interesting things to report. Yuan originally studied at a school in Hubei. Later, Yuan came south to participate in the National Games held in Hangzhou this year. Initially, he planned to enter Datong University, but after learning that Datong's school rules were very strict, he entered Datong University. Yuan is very good at sports and loves sports. During his detention in the den, the four kidnappers guarding him asked him to show off his skills. Yuan happily agreed and had the kidnappers remove their guns. He wrestled with them one by one and defeated them all. The kidnappers admired him and treated Yuan exceptionally well, buying him many novels and often providing him with a large amount of fruit to relieve his boredom. Therefore, Yuan did not suffer any pain from entering the den to his escape.</p>
<h3>Escorting a Nantong Bandit Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Sea on a Steamer</h3>
<p>Land Detective Neglects Guard Duty</p>
<p>Sent to Local Court for Handling</p>
<p>Zhang Jingtang, a detective from the Fourth District Detective Team of the Wusong Water Police, arrested a sea bandit named He Langai on Huiwen Road in Zhabei at around 8:00 AM the day before yesterday. He immediately brought him back to the Wusong District for interrogation. The person claimed to be He Lanying and did not admit to being a bandit. However, it was found that the suspect He Langai had committed communist acts in Nantong and was wanted by the local Security Regiment with a reward. However, whether He Lanying was the alias of the suspect should be determined through interrogation. The district department sent three detectives, Lin Yunzhi, Pan Jianqing, and Lu Zhigao, to escort the suspect to Shanghai. They boarded the Daqing merchant steamer at the Dada Wharf in Nanshi to escort him to Nantong. When the ship passed the Hupu Sea, the suspect claimed he wanted to relieve himself. The on-duty detective, Lu Zhigao, accompanied the suspect to the deck railing. Unexpectedly, the suspect took advantage of the detective's inattention and suddenly jumped into the sea. The detective rushed forward to grab him, but it was too late. He immediately reported to the captain to stop the ship and rescue him. However, the wind was strong, the tide was rapid, and the bandit had already drifted away with the waves and must have drowned. After the incident, the three detectives rushed back to the Wusong District Headquarters yesterday morning to report to the district chief that the suspect had committed suicide by jumping into the sea, apparently out of fear of being punished. However, the detective Lu Zhigao was negligent in his guard duty and was to blame. He ordered that the detective Lu be sent to the Shanghai District Court for punishment. The two detectives, Lin Yunzhi and Pan Jianqing, were ordered to hand over the investigation to Zhu Shaoting, the director of the detective department, to investigate whether there was any connection between the situation and the incident, and then review the matter.</p>
<h3>A Newspaper Vendor Robbed</h3>
<p>In Addition to Selling Newspapers, He Exchanges Currency</p>
<p>Robbed of a Large Sum of Money Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Cried "Catch the Thief" and Was Shot</p>
<p>Jin Mingsheng, 36 years old from Pudong, is a robust man who works as a newspaper vendor for the Continental Newspaper in this city and exchanges currency on various ships. He has lived at No. 71, Zhuangyuan Dafu New Lane, Xihua Road, for eight years. After years of business, he has accumulated some savings and was targeted by bandits, resulting in a robbery and assault case. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Newspaper Vendor and Silver Dollar Exchange Jin Mingsheng is the head of the newspaper vendors at the Continental Newspaper, and he employs several assistants. Every morning, he distributes newspapers to each household as usual. When he has time, he exchanges silver dollars at various ports. When foreign warships and merchant ships arrive in port, he carries local cash and banknotes on board to solicit currency exchange.</p>
<p>Bag Filled with Huge Sum of Money Yesterday morning at 5:30 AM, Jin and his assistant, a fellow villager named Lu Fuyuan, 26 years old, walked out of his house, each carrying a newspaper bag. Jin's bag contained a small silver box with more than 2,000 yuan in cash, 150 US dollars, and more than 100 dimes. Lu's bag contained 200-300 yuan in cash. They planned to go to the pier to wait for a certain company's ship to arrive and perform his secondary currency exchange business.</p>
<p>Bandits Ambush Midway Unexpectedly, at the entrance of Xihua Road, three bandits in blue cloth shirts and pants were lying in ambush. One of them took out a pistol to threaten and intimidate, claiming to be inspecting contraband. Jin immediately refused sternly and demanded to see the police officer's credentials. The bandit holding the gun did not respond, showing a look of panic. Another bandit standing nearby said to the gun holder, "This person is quite cunning, shoot him quickly."</p>
<p>Ran Forward, Flying Jin, hearing these words, threw down the newspaper bag and ran forward, shouting "Thief!" His assistant, Lu Fuyuan, followed behind. The bandits picked up the bag and, seeing bundles of banknotes and US dollars, fled with the stolen goods. After running a little distance, Jin looked back and saw the bandits fleeing. Jin, unwilling to lose this large sum of money, turned back, his shouts of "Robbers!" echoing in the air.</p>
<p>A Bullet Through the Lower Abdomen At that time, the bandits, fearing the arrival of detectives and police, fired three shots. One bullet hit Jin's right lower abdomen and exited from the back of his buttocks. Jin immediately fell to the ground. His assistant, Fuyuan, was filled with fear. He saw the bandits leave and rushed back home to inform his wife. He hired a car to take him to the Tongren Hospital.</p>
<p>Life Is Not in Great Danger After the doctor dressed his wound and applied medicine, Jin's mind was still clear in the evening, and his pulse was good. He was able to describe the robbery. His life was not in great danger. The hospital reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station, who ordered Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and arrest the robbers.</p>
<h3>Good Results from the Japanese Concession's Ban on Gambling</h3>
<p>After the Japanese Consulate in this city strictly enforced the ban on gambling among Japanese residents, good results have occurred. Recently, the number of Japanese residents going to the three greyhound racing tracks has greatly decreased. According to the Japanese police investigation, only 50 men and one woman went to Yiyuan on the 26th of this month. The night before, only 145 men and six women went to Mingyuan. On the 29th, the number going to Shenyuan was even smaller, only 34 men and two women. In contrast, before the ban on gambling, about 1,000 Japanese people would go to Mingyuan for each race, and 500-600 people would often go to the Jiangwan Racecourse.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Fire Brigade Personnel Come to Shanghai to Visit</h3>
<p>Zhang Xianjia, the organization minister of the Suzhou Fire Brigade Union, and Cao Wanbiaoqing, a member of the training department, believe that since the Suzhou government is planning to build a water plant and establish fire stations in each district, fire prevention should be actively improved. They organized a fire prevention inspection tour. The group had 18 members in total. Zhang and Cao led the group to Shanghai to visit the fire prevention of the North and South cities and the fire brigades in the Public Concession. Yesterday (31st) morning at 10:00 AM, they visited the fire brigades of Sections 1, 2, and 3 in Zhabei. Yao Xiangsheng, the director of Section 1, Yu Tingkai of Section 2, and Liu Rongtai of Section 3, along with Jin Shiru of the Union, welcomed them separately and provided tea and refreshments. After the visit, they went to Zhabei Charity Group Square to take a photo and dispersed.</p>
<h3>The Tsinghua Alumni Association Clubhouse Will Be Established Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tsinghua Alumni Association Clubhouse is located on the fourth floor of the China Trust Company (formerly the Industrial and Commercial Bank) at No. 50 Beijing Road. It is scheduled to hold its establishment meeting at 6:00 PM tomorrow (2nd). There are no fewer than 300 alumni in Shanghai. A banquet will be held to celebrate. It is said that the establishment of the clubhouse is due to the efforts of former president Zhou Jimei. The donation initiated last year has received 10,000 yuan, and another 30,000 yuan has been pledged but not yet received. If the remaining 30,000 yuan is collected, the association will purchase or build a new clubhouse, which will mirror the clubhouse in Peiping. Although the current clubhouse is not as large as the clubhouse in Peiping, it has seven large dormitory rooms for alumni in Shanghai or those passing through. In addition, there are elegant dining rooms, meeting rooms, entertainment rooms, reading rooms, bars, bathrooms, etc. Experienced staff are hired to manage and provide lunch and dinner to facilitate those lodging here and those who do not return home for lunch in various industries. The clubhouse is located in the commercial center, which is convenient and comfortable. It is no less elegant than other places and more tranquil. It is suitable for banquets, meeting friends, lodging, and reading, making it especially valuable. All construction, layout, and decoration of the clubhouse are carefully detailed by the president of the association, Shi Jiyuan, the manager of the Four Lines Savings Association, Mai Zuoheng, the manager of the China Trust Company, and the famous architect Zhuang Jun. The equipment in the clubhouse has not yet been completed. It is said that at the meeting, it is also planned to solicit donations from students for all useful decorations and equipment so that the Shanghai Tsinghua Alumni Association will be a unique alumni association in the country.</p>
<h3>Special District Court Burns Opium Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Special District Court, it has been stipulated that all confiscated opium, morphine, and other narcotics must be burned every three months. Opium has been burned once before. Now that another three months have passed, the second opium burning was held yesterday afternoon. At that time, Director Yang ordered the judicial police to move the confiscated narcotics to the pre-dug pit in the Tongren Baoantang Yizhong next to the court. Representatives from various agencies and groups were sent to the scene to supervise. The representatives present included Xu Mei from the Prosecutor's Office of the Special District Court, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the County Party Headquarters, the National Anti-Drug Association, and the Higher Branch Court, and the Prosecutor's Office of the Higher Branch Court. The judicial police first used sharp blades to break open the narcotics to show their authenticity and then weighed them on a scale. Then they lit a fire and burned them. The narcotics were mixed with salt to eliminate their irritating effect. Before long, the fire blazed up. Hundreds of pounds of narcotics were turned to ashes.</p>
<h3>Slaughter Statistics for July, August, and September</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau handles livestock inspections, dividing them into pre-slaughter and post-slaughter inspections. The statistics for May and June have been reported in the previous newspaper. Now it is learned that the bureau has also prepared the statistics for July, August, and September, which are listed separately below. In July, 37,767 pigs, 1,217 sheep, and 4,577 cows were inspected before slaughter. 21,700 pigs, 1,650 sheep, and 1,608 cows were inspected after slaughter.

<h3>The Electric Power Company Erects Electric Poles Beyond the Border</h3>
<p>Police Station Sends Police to Arrest</p>
<p>Workers Flee</p>
<p>Merchants and residents in the Xinjing Town area of ​​northwestern Shanghai were very inconvenienced by the lack of electric lights at night. Later, the citizens of the entire town repeatedly asked the electric power company of the Concession to install and connect them but failed to achieve their goal. They then asked the Shanghai Zhabei Chinese Electric Power Company for assistance. After repeated consideration by the company, it was decided that it was a cross-border road, and regardless of the loss, poles should be erected to connect the electricity. Thus, preparations were made, and the installation was finally carried out in the spring of this year, greatly lighting up the area. However, there were occasional foreign residences or gardens on the cross-border roads near the town, all of which had electric lights connected by the Concession. Since the town was connected to electricity by the Chinese side, the electric power company of the Concession has expressed dissatisfaction from time to time. In the middle of last month, people were sent to Luo Biegen Road in the town to investigate the route and location, seemingly preparing to erect poles and connect lines. When Wang, the director of the First Branch of the Sixth District, learned of this, he ordered all police officers to pay attention. If the Concession sent workers to erect poles, they must report at any time to take countermeasures. Unexpectedly, the electric power company of the Public Concession sent more than a dozen workers to the intersection of Luo Biegen Road, the market of the town, to erect three electric poles and was preparing to install lines to connect the original poles and lines. A patrol policeman saw this and immediately returned to the station to report. Director Wang, believing that the company was deliberately erecting poles beyond the border and disturbing the peace, sent police to arrest them. Unexpectedly, the workers had already heard the news and fled in all directions. To this day, the wooden poles are still standing, and no workers have come to install them. Director Wang has already reported the situation to the Director of the Public Security Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>Python Discovered While Digging a Stone Outline</h3>
<p>Head with Two Horns, Over Thirty Feet Long</p>
<p>Countless Snakes Disappeared</p>
<p>The rear of the residence of Ao Amao, a farmer in Ao's Residence (said to be descendants of King Ao) on the boundary of Shanghai West Upper Song, faces a graveyard of about twenty acres, surrounded by rivers on three sides, forming a magnificent landscape. Weeds are full of the ground, and thorns grow densely, making it impossible to cultivate. Usually, no one sets foot there. However, there are many stone caves in the park (according to the elders, the tomb of King Ao is inside, so there are many people with the surname Ao, which may not be baseless). I do not know what era it was built or whose tombs they are. It is difficult to study them after so many years. Those who are familiar with history may know it. Recently, the Ao family was impoverished. Ao Amao initiated a proposal to dismantle the stone outline and sell it and open up the twenty acres of barren land for cultivation as a public vegetable garden for the Ao family. Therefore, when they were excavating it the other day, a giant snake with horns on its head was discovered in the stone outline. The head was like a dustpan, its eyes were shining, and there were countless small snakes. In a short while, they dispersed and disappeared. Only dragonflies were flying in the air, and it was unusually dark at the time. Everyone was shocked and ran home. The story became a myth for a while.</p>
<h3>Record of a Runaway Wife</h3>
<p>Husband Seeks Wife, Knives and Rulers Fly</p>
<p>Tailor Suffers, Head Bleeds</p>
<p>Xu Meisheng, 28 years old from Wuxi, lives at No. 1102, Xinping Lane, Longmen Road, Baxianqiao, French Concession. He hired a Zhu woman from the same village as his wife through a matchmaker. Ms. Zhu was the same age as Xu, but her nature was very lewd. After entering the family, she saw that Xu had neither property nor savings, and the family was quite poor. Therefore, she was restless in the house and ran away privately in May of this year. Xu had searched everywhere but could not find her. Recently, his aunt, Zhang Xu, informed him that Ms. Zhu was now hiding in a clothing store opened by Tao Lu, a Jiangyin woman, at No. 16, Meiji Lane, Xuejiabang, Nanshi. After learning this, Xu followed</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>her tracks yesterday at around 9:00 AM to investigate. He saw Ms. Zhu inside and grabbed her to bring her home, but she refused, resulting in a big conflict. Both sides grabbed scissors, rulers, chalk bags, etc. from the clothing table and threw them wildly. Unexpectedly, the scissors flew and hit Li Liangbao, a tailor from Suzhou who was sitting next to him, on the head, causing him to bleed profusely. The police officer Haien, who was watching at Post No. 25, heard the commotion and rushed to the scene. He brought the men and women, including the injured person, to the First Branch Station. The director of the station conducted a preliminary trial of the case and, because it involved injury, ordered that a document be prepared and sent to the Shanghai District Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>A Kidnapped Child Found in the Chunjiang Hotel</h3>
<p>Xin Erguan from Songjiang</p>
<p>Xin Zhangsheng's thirteen-year-old son, Erguan, a farmer from near Xinzhuang in Songjiang County, was kidnapped by bandits who demanded a huge ransom. Xin reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau of the county, requesting an arrest. The military police inspection office learned that the kidnappers and the kidnapped child were hiding in the Chunjiang Hotel behind the Great World on Caishi Street in the French Concession. They immediately prepared a document and sent Shen to Shanghai to report to the French police station to cooperate with Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the hotel to ambush. Only the kidnapped child, Xin Erguan, was rescued. The kidnappers had already heard the news and escaped. Yesterday, the police took the kidnapped child back to the Songjiang County Public Security Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>County Government Discusses Labor Conscription for Road Construction Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai County Government convened a meeting at 1 p.m. to discuss matters related to the labor conscription and road construction for Tangbei Road. The meeting was attended by Wu Wenhua, the director of the County Construction Bureau, as well as Peng Zhaotang and Yang Fulin, the chiefs of the Second and Third Districts, respectively. Ye Dezhen, the secretary of the County Government, presided over the meeting, and Hu Gongshou served as the recorder. The four proposals put forward by the County Construction Bureau were resolved as follows: (1) Regarding the Tangbei Road route, which has already been surveyed and demarcated, the lists of labor conscription and commutation payments for the ten-li area on both sides of the road should be submitted by the Second and Third Districts within a specified time limit for implementation. It was decided that the work should begin on Monday of next week (i.e., November 3rd) and be completed within two weeks. (2) The Second and Third Districts should promptly report to the Bureau the villages and towns within the ten-li area along the route for the Bureau to allocate and carry out publicity work. It was decided that the Second and Third Districts should comply as soon as possible. (3) Regarding how to allocate the work for Tangbei Road, it was decided that the area east of Hujia Creek would be the responsibility of the Second District, and the area west of Hujia Creek would be the responsibility of the Third District. (4) Regarding the proposal to request the County Government to appoint section chiefs, it was decided to appoint the district chiefs as section chiefs, and the district chiefs would nominate and appoint the sub-section chiefs.</p>
<h3>Zhang Sixu Regains Freedom</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Sixu, a reporter for the Guomin News Agency, was previously detained by the garrison headquarters under suspicion due to the ongoing North-South war. Although various parties made efforts to rescue him, Commander Xiong eventually declared that Zhang would be given special preferential treatment and released once the military situation concluded. The Journalists' Association and other rescue organizations then realized that there was no other recourse. Mr. Zhang was released by Commander Xiong the day before yesterday. Mr. Zhang's relatives and friends visited his residence to express their regards.</p>
<h3>Opposing Xu Jiqing's Proposals</h3>
<p>Declaration by the Four Unions of the Commercial Press</p>
<p>The Trade Union of the Publishing Department of the Commercial Press, the Trade Union of the Sales Department, the Trade Union of the General Affairs Department, and the Trade Union of the Translation Department issued a declaration opposing the proposals made by Xu Jiqing of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at the National Industry and Commerce Conference, stating: The National Industry and Commerce Conference is about to open, and we hope that the outcome of this conference will contribute to the improvement of national industry and commerce, so as not to betray the original intention of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in convening the conference. Unexpectedly, it was recently reported that Xu Jiqing of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce proposed a motion to "establish the employer's right to increase wages for employees," intending to hand over all our job opportunities and remuneration to the employers, seeking rights for a minority of capitalists while disregarding the life and death of the majority of workers. For the sake of our own interests, we must urgently rise up to oppose this. Workers working in factories should naturally have definite guarantees for their own positions in order to work with peace of mind and produce results. If employers can hire or fire workers at will, workers will feel that they are in danger of losing their jobs at any time, and their work efficiency will naturally decrease. Wages are not only the employer's compensation for workers, but also the means for society to provide for the livelihoods of workers. While employers can determine the amount of wages based on the level of work performance, they should also provide us with the minimum cost of living to maintain the workers' livelihoods. Now that prices continue to rise, it is becoming increasingly difficult for workers' families to maintain their basic needs for food and clothing. If workers are hungry and cold, and their children are crying, even if they force themselves to work in the factory, what results can they achieve? From this perspective, even if we were to speak from the employers' point of view, we could not completely entrust the power to hire and fire workers and increase wages to a small number of people. Xu Jiqing, a prominent figure in the industrial and commercial circles of this city, wants to take advantage of this opportunity to increase the power of employers, and even wants to place the lives and wages of the majority of workers in the hands of a small number of capitalists, undermining Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood and acting perversely. This is truly absurd. For the sake of our own interests, we must, on the one hand, request the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the representatives of the National Industry and Commerce Conference to reject this proposal, and on the other hand, we must awaken workers across the country to rise up and oppose it.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Approves the Organization of a Nanyang Inspection Group by the National Products Industry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factories Association received a dispatch from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, No. Shangzi 13110, stating: We received a telegram regarding the convening of representatives from various factories to organize an inspection group to the Nanyang Islands, carrying samples to negotiate all matters and drafting simple regulations, requesting that consuls in various ports and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce be informed for reference. We have learned all the details from the telegram and the simple regulations. The association intends to gather representatives from various factories to organize an inspection group to the Nanyang Islands to promote overseas trade, carrying samples to negotiate all matters with overseas Chinese merchants in various ports. This is highly commendable. The eight articles of the simple regulations submitted are generally appropriate and should be approved for filing. In addition to instructing the consulates in Singapore, Penang, and Java, as well as the Chinese General Chambers of Commerce in Singapore, Penang, Batavia, Surabaya, Sambas, Jambi, Palembang, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cochinchina, and Manila, to handle the matter properly and sending separate letters of introduction, you should comply with this approval.</p>
<h3>Ms. Guo Jingluan Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>Report on the Establishment of Gongshi Middle School</p>
<p>Since her husband, Cai Gongshi, died a martyr in the Jinan Incident, Ms. Guo Jingluan, Cai Gongshi's widow, has been raising funds in various ports of Nanyang to establish a Gongshi Middle School to commemorate the late martyr's legacy. After more than a year, she traveled to various ports of Nanyang and received the support of overseas Chinese. The project was successfully established at the intersection of Haige Road and Fukaissen Road in this city. Ms. Guo hosted a banquet for the press at the Dongya Restaurant the night before, where she reported on everything. The event ended happily at around 9 p.m.</p>
<h3>Anti-Opium Society Pays Attention to the Opium Case in Xiamen</h3>
<p>British Government Obtains Confirmation</p>
<p>Anti-Smoking Society Investigates the Main Culprit</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society recently received information from Geneva stating that the British government, in its 1929 opium report to the League of Nations, stated that Xiamen, Fujian, is a drug trafficking center and that Zhang Yongshun is the main culprit in this activity, repeatedly trafficking opium to Nanyang, Burma, and other places. This matter is of great importance to our country's reputation and the future of opium prohibition. The Society has reported the facts in a letter to the Central Anti-Opium Committee and the Fujian Anti-Opium Committee, requesting strict investigation and handling. The Fujian Anti-Opium Committee dispatched personnel to Xiamen to work with the Public Security Bureau to arrest Zhang Yongshun. Zhang had already heard the news and fled, and only Zhang's eldest son was arrested and released on bail pending Zhang Yongshun's arrest and investigation. Zhang has considerable influence in Xiamen and is currently using money to send his henchmen to Nanjing, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places to lobby in various ways to evade the law. The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society believes that this case is related to international reputation and is no less important than the Gao Ying case. Therefore, it has sent a letter to all sectors of society, urging them to jointly condemn and urge the authorities to investigate and handle the case according to the law. The original letter is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: Xiamen has always been a major base for foreign opium and narcotics trafficking. Cases such as the Shenzhou Pharmacy Huang Qingan case, the Lin Changcai case, and the strange ship transporting opium case publicized by the League of Nations are all activities of Xiamen merchants and opium traffickers. The Society has repeatedly received reports from anti-opium comrades in Xiamen stating that Dr. Zhang Yongshun is of poor character, greedy, and is the main criminal involved in the smuggling of opium and narcotics. He has been engaged in this ugly business for more than 20 years. He usually relies on the money he has made from his crimes to engage in social activities, and he participates in almost all groups and businesses in Xiamen, while at the same time bribing detectives and police officers, and employing thugs to engage in activities for his own selfish purposes. Zhang himself not only traffics opium but is also addicted to smoking. The Huang Qingan case and other cases are all related to Zhang. The authorities did not strictly investigate and handle this case, so Zhang remained at large, committing crimes with impunity. It is truly appalling. Recently, we received information from Geneva, and according to a report published in the Shanghai Dalu News on August 17 of this year, the British government stated in its 1929 opium report to the League of Nations that Xiamen is a center for the purchase and sale of narcotics, and that Zhang Yongshun is the main criminal involved in this activity, repeatedly smuggling large quantities of narcotics which have been seized. The report stated that in September 1928, ten cans of heroin labeled as produced in Germany were seized in British Burma. The German authorities proved that part of this narcotic was commissioned by Zhang Yongshun, a doctor from Xiamen, China, to purchase it on his behalf, and a passport was presented as evidence. The rest was shipped to a merchant in London for transshipment elsewhere. According to the merchant, this heroin was shipped by the parent company to Shanghai and then transported to Xiamen for Dr. Zhang Yongshun to use. In October of the same year, 32 ounces of morphine, 500 ounces of heroin, and 28 pounds of Persian opium were seized in Rangoon. The heroin in this shipment was also produced in Germany, and the circumstances were the same as in the previous case. This batch of narcotics was also purchased by Dr. Zhang Yongshun of Xiamen. Among the above-mentioned narcotics, not only was there heroin from Germany, but there was also a large amount of morphine with trademarks (the prohibition stamp was printed in the Far East), and the purpose was to be sold in a British merchant's shop, but it failed because the trademark was fake. There were also 100 ounces of heroin manufactured in Tokyo, Japan, which were seized at the same time along with 225 ounces of heroin with the trademark of the mysterious Fujitsuru Pharmaceutical Company. The truth of the above two cases has not yet been ascertained, but from this, it can be seen that Xiamen, China, is the center for smuggling narcotics to India and other places. We have investigated and found that Zhang, as a doctor, has no need for such a large amount of narcotics. It is clear that he is smuggling for profit. The evidence is conclusive. We have already sent a letter to the authorities, urging them to arrest the criminal Zhang Yonggu and investigate and handle him strictly according to the law in order to demonstrate our country's spirit of judicial independence and the government's determination to prohibit opium, and to avoid international criticism that would damage the country's reputation. Since the British government has reported the crime to the League of Nations, the evidence is clear and there is no way to escape punishment. If we do not investigate and handle the case strictly, how can we expect the prohibition of opium to succeed? The international status will only decline further. The Society is deeply concerned about the scourge of opium and cares about the country's reputation. Therefore, we have listed the facts and reported them to you. We have always admired your enthusiasm for opium prohibition and your sympathy for our cause. We dare to ask you to jointly condemn and urge the authorities to strictly investigate and handle the case according to the law in order to warn the major criminals and eliminate the scourge of opium. If you have any evidence related to Zhang's crimes, please submit it to the Society in writing so that we can forward it to the authorities.</p>

<h3>Child Welfare Society Implements Protection of Children in Other Places</h3>

In order to implement measures to protect children in other places, the Association recently received reports from a member in Nantong regarding cases of abuse of daughters-in-law: (1) A daughter-in-law in Chong, outside the West Gate of Nantong, was abused by her adoptive family. The Association requested that the Women's Association investigate in order to handle the matter. (2) A daughter-in-law of the Tai family on West Street, Nantong, was beaten by her mother-in-law with a stick. The Association requested that measures be taken to handle the matter.

The Association requested that the First District and Third Branch of the County Party Department discuss and handle the matter. After receiving these reports, the Association immediately sent a letter to the Nantong County Government, requesting that they investigate and handle the matter in detail in accordance with the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Order No. 518 prohibiting the abuse of daughters-in-law. The extension of this practice is truly the happiness of abused children throughout the country.</p>
<h3>News from Various Native Place Associations</h3>
<p>Hebei: The Hebei Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association, in view of the repeated natural and man-made disasters in Hebei Province and the massing of large armies this summer, which has resulted in heavy taxes and corvée labor, making it impossible for the people to make a living, has specially petitioned the National Government to issue a clear order to abolish them. The original telegram is recorded below: To the National Government of the Capital: Hebei was unfortunately hit by a severe flood last year. The people who were in the path of the flood were swept away by the waves. Even those who were fortunate enough to survive were left with no harvest for the year, and their food was insufficient, undermining their vitality. At a time of suffering and displacement, we hoped for a bumper harvest in the coming year. Who would have expected that the warlords would take the opportunity to create chaos, conscripting soldiers and seizing food from the people to feed the large armies, imposing heavy taxes and corvée labor, which has exhausted the people's resources? The military defeat led to mutinies, and the soldiers turned into bandits lurking in the fields, resulting in repeated natural and man-made disasters. Fortunately, Vice Commander Zhang supported the Central Army, which was invincible wherever it went. Now that the country is at peace, we hope that our government will take pity on the suffering of the people and issue a clear order to abolish the arbitrary taxes and miscellaneous levies imposed during the warlord era in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. The Association, in its capacity as a representative of the people, feels obliged to speak out. We have specially listed the grievances and humbly request your consideration. The Hebei Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association kowtows.</p>

<p>Western Paint Industry: The Western Paint Industry Association issued a declaration yesterday regarding the fact that the paint industry association affiliated with the Shanghai Foreign Goods Nine Industries Association has violated party orders and refused to join the association. The declaration stated that the Western paint industry is part of international trade and is also a necessary supplementary industry for the dyeing of silk and cotton textiles in our country. Its business promotes the production of Chinese silk and cotton and other cultural undertakings, and has become a necessary core of social industry. All Western paint industry operators have never had a group to unite and lead them, and they have been unprotected, facing increasing dangers and falling into decline. They had no choice but to rise up and accept the guidance of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang to organize this association. The purpose of the association is to alleviate the aforementioned suffering, correct harmful practices, and maintain the common interests of the industry. It is surprising that there are still some capitalist industry operators who initiated a small organization in the era of warlords and affiliated it with the Shanghai Foreign Goods Nine Industries Association. Since the establishment of the association's headquarters, this association, while acknowledging that those industry operators are not legitimate organizations, believes that their purpose of promoting the interests of the industry is the same, but recognizes that this is a kind of illegally narrow organization. According to Article 5 of the Industry and Commerce Association Law, it is necessary to merge them in accordance with the law. Before the general meeting was convened, the association had sent a letter requesting them to join and complete the integration in order to promote the common welfare of the industry. The comrades serving in the general meeting are all loyal members of the industry who have sacrificed their personal interests and have no rights whatsoever. However, those industry operators not only showed no concern for their own interests, but also remained stubbornly unenlightened, and refused to join the association. The messenger sent by the association was scolded and told to "get out." The general meeting, upholding the principle of public welfare, tolerated the unreasonable attitude and, in a spirit of generosity, went a step further to make a final appeal, urging them to come to their senses. However, they continued to make excuses and refused to listen, showing a stubbornness that cannot be moved by reason. In order to implement the law, this association cannot tolerate this and has submitted the matter to the relevant higher-level authorities for review. The Municipal Party Department ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to consult with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to determine the fate of industry organizations that have been jointly organized by more than one industry. As a result, the paint industry members affiliated with the Foreign Goods Nine Industries Association were ordered to merge with the Western Paint Industry Association. This association ordered them to comply. Unexpectedly, those industry operators adopted a strong attitude, disregarding the party's orders and refusing to join the association. They even claimed that the Foreign Goods Nine Industries Association had been dissolved and that the original headquarters had been changed to the Revitalization Club, i.e., the Gathering Club, etc. (omitted). Now, the general headquarters of the illegally organized Nine Industries Association has been overthrown by the association with the spirit of the party. All our loyal comrades have upheld the spirit of dauntlessness, worked hard, and persevered to complete the mission and achieve a unified organization. We hereby declare.</p>

<h3>### Chairman Chiang's Return Home</h3>
<p>— A Nan</p>
<p>Since the defeat of Yan and Feng, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government returned triumphantly to Nanjing to attend the National Day celebrations. On the 24th of the month, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, took the "Xin Ning Shao" steamer to Ningbo. Those accompanying him were Secretary Rong Zongli, Chief of Guard Wang Shihe, Chief of Special Affairs Zhang Menghe, and more than a dozen plainclothes guards. At about 4 pm, the ship entered the Zhenhai estuary. The Zhenhai fort and the Haijing and other warships in the river all raised flags and fired a 21-gun salute. At 5:30, they arrived in Ningbo. After briefly greeting the welcomers, he disembarked. To the accompaniment of Western music, he boarded a private car, crossed the Xinjiang Bridge, passed through the southern suburbs, turned onto the Yin-Feng Road, and went straight to the Chiang residence in Xikou, Fenghua. The guards also rode in seven cars behind. At 7:40, the car arrived at the Wuling Farm in Xikou. All the teachers and students of Wuling Elementary School and people from all walks of life, about 500 people, were standing in front of the farm to greet them. Chairman Chiang and his wife got out of the car and walked into Wuling Farm and Wuling Elementary School for an inspection. He returned to the private residence, the Wenchang Pavilion. At about 10 pm, he took a car to Rushan Pavilion to visit the tomb of his mother, Madam Yu Lin Chiang. The Wuling Farm is located at the foot of Wuling Mountain, with a total area of about 44 mu, divided into an orchard area of 11.6 mu, a livestock area of 4.6 mu, an early crop area of 6.8 mu, a paddy field area of 7.5 mu, a grazing area of 4.5 mu, a bamboo garden of 2 mu, 130 plum trees, 27 juniper trees, 33 poplar trees, and more than 4,000 other plants such as holly, fragrant Daphne, camellias, peach blossoms, azaleas, weeping willows, and winter jasmine. In terms of animal husbandry, there are turkeys, French carrier pigeons, foreign white pigs, French sheep, rabbits, pigeons, bees, etc. Chairman Chiang and his wife were very pleased after the visit. Wuling Elementary School is located at the south gate of Wuling Park, modeled after the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, so Chairman Chiang stood there for a while. To the west of the school is the kindergarten, the hospital, the two playgrounds, and the kindergarten sports field. The chairman also praised the perfection of the plan after the inspection. I remember that 20 years ago, I traveled to Xuedou Mountain and saw the spiritual beauty of Yintan, Miaogaotai, and Qianzhangyan. I had the idea that a place of outstanding people and land. Passing through Xikou and seeing the Mao's Elementary School, I also deeply admired the perfection of education. Time flies like water. On the road to Xuedou, there are clouds of officials. The gathering of spiritual beauty produces outstanding people. It is reminiscent of the old tour 20 years ago.</p>
<h3>### A Record of Donation of Salaries to Build a School in Songjiang County</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>The Songjiang County Middle School has been established for more than three years. Last summer, when Shen Jun Lianbi came to head this school, the number of students increased sharply, and the school building was felt to be increasingly lacking. Therefore, Shen Jun borrowed a large sum of money from a certain bank to build five buildings, and deducted 5% of the salaries of teachers and staff as a guarantee, with a period of eight years to repay the principal and interest. This is enough to show Shen Jun's enthusiasm for education, and it is also rare that the teachers and staff can encourage this in a state of high prices and low salaries. After the matter was completed, Zhang Jun Zhuocheng was asked to write a record, and Jinshan Gao Jun Shishi was asked to write it. This is also a small, hard and enthusiastic memorial in the education sector of Songjiang. The text says that the analogy of righteousness and profit is the reason for the distinction between gentlemen and villains. For thirty years, the theory of innovation and spending money to promote learning has been noisy and intense. However, some people profit from their fame or profit from their interests, pretending to be righteous and acting habitually. There is no mention of the use of righteousness. It is only from the county middle school in our hometown that the school was founded. For more than three years, it has been lacking in expense, and the place for students to study and rest is incomplete. Last summer, Shen Jun Lianbi came to head this school, and the number of students increased sharply. The dormitory building was increasingly lacking, and the teachers had to live in guest houses. Shen Jun regretted it and vowed to add buildings. He repeatedly asked for permission, but was not allowed. Therefore, he resolutely told his colleagues: "Today, is borrowing money to build and repaying the savings a way to solve the problem by ourselves?" The crowd thought it was so, so they planned to borrow 6,000 gold from the Songjiang Bank to build five buildings, and deduct 5% of the salaries of teachers and staff for eight years to repay the principal and interest. The Education Bureau guarantees it. It was decided to build it on the west side of the old Weisi old school building. The completion date was set. The degree was accurate. The four buildings on the east side of the school building were prepared for the old and new to be connected in the future. In this matter, I admire Shen Jun's ability to understand righteousness, and all colleagues can respond and seek each other. Since the beginning and end have been recorded in detail, it is further explained that the chapter on the analogy of the Analects of Confucius means that righteousness is what is appropriate for heaven, and profit is what is desired by human feelings. It is the duty of teachers to enjoy obtaining talents. However, calculating the time and taking the value to support the family is also a common thing for human feelings. Suppressing people to extend the sky is not too much for the so-called virtuous gentlemen of ancient times. Shen Jun is ashamed to be a gentleman alone and plans with his colleagues. His colleagues support this righteous act to benefit future generations. Is he also a gentleman? I hope that those who study here will gradually and deeply understand that in the future, they will definitely be men of righteousness, so that those who pretend to be righteous will no longer be able to take the opportunity to steal fame and profit. I hope that I will not betray the sincerity of the gentlemen who built it. Zhang, a fellow villager, recorded it on September 1, the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. Gao Xie of Jinshan wrote it.</p>
<h3>### A Record of the Meeting of Parent and Son Through the Shadow of a Stick</h3>
<p>— Gu Wubian</p>
<p>Mr. Shen of Zhenzhong is over 50 years old. His family is well-off. He is engaged in farming for a living. His wife died early. He is a widower. He has a son and a daughter. The daughter is married. The son's name is Tao. He works in a local teahouse. He is quite brave and likes to fight fiercely. However, he is very filial to his father. In that year, the area suddenly suffered a bandit robbery, and nine out of ten houses were empty. Tao also took his father's money to go to a neighboring province to avoid it temporarily. Unexpectedly, he was dispersed by bandits on the road. Tao searched for three or four days without finding him. He was lost on the road and didn't know where to go. Then he met a friend. The friend was a sailor and could barely make a living. Therefore, he followed his friend's advice and went to the Shanghai Bund. After arriving in Shanghai, he had nothing to do at first. He inquired about his father's whereabouts, but there was no sign of him. Before long, he was introduced and became a police officer. He was frugal and careful, and was appreciated by his superiors. In this way, he had some savings for more than a year. However, his violent nature did not change. Whenever he encountered rickshaw pullers on the street obstructing traffic or violating regulations, he would raise the short stick in his hand and beat them arbitrarily. Again and again, he didn't care. Those who were beaten were either seriously injured, or lost their jobs, or damaged their vehicles. No one dared to speak out against him. Tao didn't know and didn't change. One day, Tao was performing his duties as usual. There were cars and horses coming and going like water and dragons. Suddenly, a rickshaw puller hunched his back, swayed his body, spoke in a whining voice, staggered his steps, and pulled his rickshaw across the road. When Tao saw it, he couldn't help but split his eyes, rushed forward, scolded loudly, and beat his back with a stick. The rickshaw puller was attacked and looked back in pain. It was just this one look that the miserable suffering turned into a look of surprise. At the same time, Tao was also surprised. After looking at it again and again, it was actually his own father pulling the rickshaw, and his son holding the stick. At this time, the father and son were both surprised, happy, and painful. Even if all the famous calligraphers and novelists in the country were gathered together, it would be difficult to describe it. Tao's father, since he was separated, wandered to Shanghai, was poor and had nowhere to go, so he pulled a rickshaw to make a living. Because of the wind and frost and hard work, his appearance became more and more haggard. He unexpectedly met here and received a stick, and reunited with his family. It is said that since then, Tao has not beaten rickshaw pullers who violate regulations again.</p>
<h3>### The Medical Community Opposes Airplanes</h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>Since the invention of airplanes, human transportation has become more and more convenient. The great contribution of science to mankind is admired by all people in the world. However, according to recent Western celebrities, the opposition to airplanes is very strong, which is quite strange.</p>
<p>People in the medical community believe that the development of the airplane industry will completely destroy the methods of preventing infectious diseases. For example, the plague and cholera in the East were not found in Western countries in the past. In modern times, due to the convenience of world transportation, this disease has spread to the world. For prevention purposes, the coasts of various countries often carry out serious inspections of imported ships, refusing to allow the sick to land in order to resist this disease. This has been quite effective since its implementation, because people who have one of the above two germs have been on the ship from the East to Europe and the United States for many days, and the symptoms are obvious, and they will never be able to escape the eyes of the inspectors. However, nowadays, the airplane industry is becoming more and more developed, and in the future, world transportation will rely on airplanes. The traffic between the East and the West can be reached in a few days. Those who get the germs can travel far away to other places to infect others before they grow. Although the inspection of passengers is strict, it is useless. The prevention of diseases in the future may be completely bankrupt, which is very sad.</p>
<p>In addition, mosquitoes and flies that carry germs and are not found in Europe and the United States will be able to expand their sphere of influence by taking advantage of the opportunity after the implementation of airplane traffic. The safety of human bodies is even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the European and American medical communities are doing their best to oppose the application of airplanes. However, airplanes are the only tool for future transportation. This kind of argument by medical scientists cannot avoid the accusation of giving up eating because of choking.</p>
<h3>### Travel Notes in Southeast Asia (69)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>At about 2 pm, we passed the Xinben Station. North of the station is the Tiansheng Bridge. This bridge is located between two large mountains. There is a deep ravine below that can be traversed for about half a mile by an iron bridge. Looking down at the bottom of the ravine, there are thousands of trees. One can only see the treetops of the car as if traveling through the treetops. There is a waterfall flowing nearby. It is a truly magical scene. The poem says:</p>
<p>Tiansheng Bridge is north of Xinben, with a hundred articles hanging on the cliff, not proud at all. Iron pillars support the sky for half a mile, and flying waves roar through the clouds.</p>
<p>The wind is born under the armpits, and the Queen Mother drives; the feet tread on clouds, the grandson's boat. A white python travels horizontally in the mountains (also the waterfall). The train flies through the treetops.</p>
<p>I have a big plan in this life. Looking at Burma and Wacheng, the population is sparse north of it. It is still in the era of nomadic forestry. It is estimated that from Wacheng to Lashio, it is about 450 miles (the train takes about 10 hours). It is the end of the North Burma Railway, and from here to the Yunnan border, it still takes seven days of walking, about 500 miles. Burma's north-south diameter is exactly 2,000 miles. North of Wacheng, it is very desolate. According to statistics, Burma has a population of only 7 million. Its land area is about that of my Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. The jade mines are the best in the world, the silver mines are extremely rich, and the forest is infinitely profitable. It is almost the best in the world. Moreover, Northern Burma and Central Burma are not only close to Yunnan, but also the old Tusi lands of our country. It is easy to immigrate 20 million people. The land in the country is worth every inch of gold, but Southeast Asia is desolate for thousands of miles. There are only animal footprints and bird tracks. It is laughable that no one knows how to manage it. I have not yet been to Malaya. I heard that there are few people on the Malay Peninsula. Roughly the same is true of the Dutch colonies. The same is true of Borneo. It is estimated that a total of 200 million people can be immigrated to Southeast Asia and the southwestern regions of Sichuan and Yunnan. If the planting industry is established, there is no need to worry about the land. If we jointly operate it with Japan and the United States, even if we have not yet formed a global Kunhua Pang, we will first form an American-Asian Federation or an Asian Federation. As long as 200 million people can be immigrated, Japanese imperialism will be completely useless. The three islands are only 50 million people. It is worrying that there is no food to eat, and many conspiracies are used to plot the three northeastern provinces? White people's management can only use economic means to absorb commercial ready-made profits, and cannot endure hard work to use farmers and workers to develop natural profits. Therefore, in name, they manage all the places east of India, but in fact, it is only a superficial commercial layer. The internal agricultural, industrial, and colonial activities are completely unable to operate. The missionary career has completely failed when it encounters the advanced Buddhist methods of India, Japan, Burma, and Java. Only the Christian missionary career has achieved a small success in China, because Chinese Buddhists have weak faith, are selfish and self-interested, and have almost lost their qualifications to protect the Dharma. There is no enthusiasm for development. Therefore, the meaning of Chinese Buddhism is good, but the cowardice and lack of enthusiasm of Buddhists is far inferior to that of other countries. In the future, if we know our shame and issue bonds to strive for management and plan the development of Southeast Asia, compared with the domestic warlords sacrificing tens of millions of people to occupy several counties, what is the gain and loss? It is a pity.</p>
<h3>### Warmth in the Heart (305)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Episode 15: Four Walls Shed Tears of Sadness for Red Love; One Seat is Enchanted by Lingering Green Intent</p>
<p>Cui Yun instructed the prompter to sing, saying that the singer had turned around. On the one hand, he smiled and said that it was just a simple sentence that the young master had nailed down. After Madam Yin knew about this secret institution, she made a big scene again. This time, Hong Lianxiang even received two slaps. She thought that life had come to this point, what was the fun of life? It would be better to die. Three cents of opium cut off her beautiful but short life. On the day she was beaten, Master Yin tried his best to comfort her, but she didn't say anything. Instead, she knelt down and kowtowed to Master Yin, saying that Master had treated me so well that I would never be able to repay your kindness in my life. It's a pity that I don't have the blessing, so I can only become a dog or a horse in the next life to repay your kindness. Master Yin thought that she was in pain and would naturally say such things. Who knew that after Master Yin turned his back, she had already prepared opium and eaten it with burning wine. By the next morning, she had already died. It was pitiful that Hong Lianxiang's mother was an honest old woman who couldn't say a word to people. Her brother was young, but the neighbors were speaking up for her, saying that Lianxiang had been too good to people on weekdays, and the neighbors all liked her. At this time, everyone quarreled, saying that such a young and beautiful person was actually ruined by others. They only had a few stinking coins and they bullied the poor girls so heartlessly. That tigress was outrageous. We won't let them go through the door. Those neighbors were all women. They didn't report to the police station. They were going to carry the dead person to the Yin family and put it in their hall, and then drag Madam Yin out and lock her on the dead person's feet. This time, they were going to pluck all the fur of the tigress. They also criticized Master Yin for being a man in vain, being so afraid of his wife that he couldn't protect a weak woman. They wanted to teach Master Yin to wear mourning clothes and act as a filial son. When this information came out, the tigress was so scared that she didn't have any tiger power and fled to her mother's house at night to hide. Master Yin was really sad at that time, and he was also willing to wear mourning clothes and act as a filial son. But after all, a master has the system of a master, and he was a little embarrassed, so he also ran away in a puff of smoke and sent a bookkeeper to negotiate and talk to a group of people. Everyone was just angry for a while. Lianxiang was already dead. Even if the tigress was beaten to death, Lianxiang couldn't be resurrected. It was better to give her a rich coffin and burial. It was said that a coffin was bought for hundreds of dollars, and everything inside was the best. The young master of the Yin family was the source of the trouble and had already run away. When the second young master came, he wore a white coat. This matter was finally over. The life of a poor person costs a few dollars to a rich person. This matter was finally over. I didn't expect there to be a little ripple.</p>
<p>The above ten kinds are sold at half price from October 22 to November 22, plus 10% for postage outside the port.</p>

<h3>### Financial Gold Market Changes Are Strong</h3>
<p>The market atmosphere is erratic. Yesterday, the 31st, the gold standard seemed to have risen slightly, but the state was erratic and unpredictable. It was difficult to grasp the movement of three or four taels. The purchase of Fuchang Yuanheng and the initial sale of Tai Kangrun Yuanmao Yong were followed by the city, but Shunli Yongcheng, etc., saw the sale, but there was no large amount of supply and demand, and the exchange restriction ticket was slightly loose, and the listing was lengthened by half a grade, and the bank bought in. As for the gold price, the large strips did not move, that is, the opening was high, and the industry center was still stable. It once reached 85 taels and zero. Afterwards, the seller Kong Yin plummeted by four taels and resumed. Fuchang Yuanheng, etc., bought in the exchange bill, so it has risen by three or four taels. At noon, it was flat. After that, the wind and waves suddenly rose, and it was rumored that the news of the US loan was that Datiao Yin was afraid of lengthening. The market atmosphere was chaotic and unbearable. The seller exceeded it, but there was almost a slump. It plummeted by four taels and suddenly saw it within 81 taels. In an instant, the exchange bill was still stable, and the bank had eaten in. Yuanxing Yongzhifeng Yong and others took this opportunity to scramble to buy, and immediately turned sharply upwards and jumped four taels. Finally, it stood at 84 taels and zero.</p>
<p>The trace is extremely difficult to figure out. Since the opening of the December market, a total of 584 taels and three cents were calculated, plus nine cents (four taels before and after the gross plate). The silver price of Datiao has not changed and has increased by one-eighth. Yuan Maoyong bought in and rose to 85 taels and two cents. Then, Yuanheng Fuchang Chunyuan Yongyu Da and other items sold out, so it fell by three taels. The British gold bank did one month 17375, but the listing may have been lengthened, so it has been reduced to 82 taels and two or three cents. The time of the first order was 2 taels and 67 cents. The listing was indeed longer by 125 US dollars. The 25th gold was reduced by 75, but the gold price had already been suppressed, so it did not drop again. It was only a few cents from 83 taels to 2 taels and 3 cents. At 9:30, Fuxing Yongjin Dayongchang and others tended to sell, and the British gold seemed to be loose. The Chinese Belgian bought 174375 in January, but the gold price plummeted by 2 taels around 10 o'clock, only counting 81 taels. Gradually going up after entering, it is because Fuchang Yuanheng and others did not pursue it after the British gold was sold. Afterwards, the January US dollar China was absorbed by 39 yuan and 25, and the bank did the January British gold 17375 slightly. It was softened by 0625, so the gold price returned by 2 taels. At 11 o'clock, all the numbers had a conclusion, and the price had been raised by 2 taels, and it was heard that Mai Jia Li bought the recent British gold 3125. At 11:30, it reached 84 taels and a half after entering. It was still flat and no longer declined, so those who entered before sold out and suppressed 89 cents at noon for 3 taels and 67 cents. It was almost noon when the market closed and the price was raised by 4 taels and 1 cent by the bull side. Then it was suppressed by a few cents and calculated as 3 taels and 67 cents. The announced price has been changed to 619 taels and 8 cents. The Japanese gold is listed at 75, first pressed at 37 taels, then 38 taels to 36 taels.</p>
<p>Wind and waves occur from time to time. The post-market opened at 83 taels and 7 cents, then increased to 4 taels and 1 cent. Hengxing and others bought in and sold out by Yuan Chengyong and retail investors. At 2:45, it was suppressed to 3 taels, 1 or 2 cents. The exchange bill was still flat, and the bank mutually did 173125 in December and 375 in January. Then, Yuanxing Yongtai Kangrun and hedging dealers all pursued the purchase, so it was dragged up by 1 tael and several cents. After 3:15, it was calculated as 4 taels, 8 or 9 cents. After a while, it was suddenly heard that there was a US loan, and people's hearts suddenly became empty to prevent Datiao from rising, so Yong Chengchang Fuyu Fushun Xuchang Yuan Chengyong and the shopkeepers sold out, and Korean gold appeared at 1 tael, 2 cents, 7 cents, 125, so a big wave occurred, and it plummeted by 4 taels to 80 taels and 8 cents at 3:30. But in an instant, it turned upwards again, because there was a profit to sell to Mai Xing in January. The British gold 17375 Yuntong absorbed the November Citibank 39 yuan and 1875. People's hearts suddenly became firm. Yuanxing Yongcheng Fengyong and various numbers of numbers rushed in and the price soared by 4 taels, restoring the previous state. After 4 o'clock, 85 taels in general, people's hearts were flustered and at a loss. After entering, there was a twist of one or two taels, once retreating to 3 taels, 7 or 8 cents, and then潜至4 taels and a half. At 4:30, the market closed at 4 taels and 2 cents, adding 8 cents compared to the daily number. After the market, several more transactions were made at 4 taels and a half. Check the largest 85 taels and 2 cents in one day and the smallest 80 taels and 8 cents. There is a difference of 4 taels and 4 cents. The announced price is suppressed by 35 or 6 taels. The early market for goods is 4 taels and 3 cents, the noon collection is 3 taels and 6 cents, and the afternoon is 3 taels and 8 cents. The market closes at 4 taels and a half.</p>
<p>Transactions are various. Among the peers, Tai Kangrun, Yuan Maoyong, Lian Yu Fa Yong, etc. paid in. Yuda, Fuxing Yong, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Dadecheng, Zhifeng Yong, etc. entered and exited without fixed numbers. Yuan Chengyong first exited and then entered. Shunli, Yongcheng Chang, Chunyuan Yong, Richang, and Jin Feng all exited. Wanxing exited less and entered more. Goods entered and exited at first sight. In the afternoon, Zhifeng Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Tai Kangrun, and Hengxing all entered. Yuan Chengyong, Wanxing, Xie Yu, Xuchang, Yongcheng Chang, Fushun, and Yuancheng all exited. The goods entered at first and then exited. The Dalian gang jointly exited more than 1,000 bars, which is quasi 7800 bars. The Guangdong gang pursued and entered a small number.</p>
<h3>### Exchange Rate Listing Lengthens by Half a Grade</h3>
<p>Near Loose and Far Flat in the Inner Plate</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Mostly Dumped</p>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market was mediocre and slightly rose. Only the British-Japanese exchange rate was reduced, and the British-American exchange rate rose slightly. Yokohama and Kobe had no honor or disgrace. The HSBC listing rates of all exchanges have been lengthened by half a grade. The British gold has been lengthened by 125, and the listing has been changed to one shilling and seven pence, 125 US dollars plus 25, a total of 38 yuan and 75 Indian exchange rates plus half a yuan, a total of 107 rupees, 25 French rates plus one yuan, a total of 162 marks, half of the Dutch guilder plus half a yuan, a total of 96 French francs plus six yuan, a total of 986 yuan, the slope exchange rate is reduced by one or two or five, a total of 145 taels and five Hong Kong is unchanged, a total of 82 taels and a half.

The gold industry dumped 200,000 yuan, which was absorbed by Huabiyuntong and others. The Japanese gold was sold slightly by the Dalian gang, and Mitsui bought in. A total of tens of thousands of yuan were concluded. The situation was observed that the exchange market still needs to make a circling bureau before the prohibition of standard gold and the exchange date is dropped. Mitsui made a December Japanese-American exchange rate of 49 yuan and 6875 yuan in the morning.</p>
<p>British Exchange The inner plate only rose and fell by 0635. In the morning, the November quotation was one shilling and seven pence, 25 January 3125. The purchase price was increased by 0625.

<h3>The Special Silver Dollar Market is Busy at the End of October</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday was the only major settlement period at the end of October for the financial community. The busy state of various settlements is unmatched each year except for the end of April and the end of the year. On the banking side, there is even more rush due to large settlements. According to industry insiders, the total amount of long-term settlements this time is estimated to be no less than 10 million taels, which is more than the previous settlement. This is because there were more transfers in the past, and fewer transfers this time, hence this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate (Silver/Cash): The opening price was 7 taels, 2 fen, 6 li, 2 hao, 5 si. The afternoon price was 7 taels, 2 fen, 6 li, 5 si. As a result, it was 8 hao and 7 hu less than the afternoon price of the previous day. This is because there was a large surplus of public debt delivery the previous day, which led to a glut of funds and a downward trend in market prices. (Silver/Silver Dollar) The opening price was 5 fen, and the afternoon price was 4 fen, which was 3 to 4 fen lower than the previous day. Spot transactions were still white. There was no market for bank postings.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Jiangnan small silver dollars opened at 6 qian 4 fen, which was 1 li lower than the previous day. As this transaction is now very simple, the market is very sluggish. Only 3,500 jiao were traded in the morning. Guangdong small silver dollars also tended downward. The opening price was 6 qian 3 fen 6 li, and the afternoon price was 6 qian 3 fen 5 li 7 hao 5 si. As a result, it fell by 1.5 li compared to the afternoon price of the previous day. 125,000 jiao were traded in the morning, and 65,000 jiao were traded in the afternoon. Copper coins were at 390,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver): Yesterday, the number of various settlements in the silver and money industry was very large. The sorting was delayed for a time, and the exact number could not be obtained at the time of writing. According to industry insiders, it is estimated that the banks' various settlements were no less than tens of millions, and just the settlement item alone was more than 10 million. (Silver Dollars) The exchange draft amount made in the morning was 1,445,000, and the amount made in the afternoon was 820,000. Only 35,000 banknotes were made in the afternoon. 215,000 banknotes were made outside the market in the morning, and 115,000 were made in the afternoon. The morning interbank transaction was 370,000, and the afternoon transaction was 500,000. The various silver dollar receipts and payments of various banks and money shops are omitted.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Interest Rates Have Been Announced on the Domestic Market</h3>
<p>The long-term interest rates for deposits at money shops have traditionally had a domestic market quotation, which must be discussed jointly by various peers. Although the interbank lending rate this time is relatively flat, there is a large discrepancy in the amount of silver available among the various money shops. Therefore, logically speaking, the long-term interest rate for deposits should be slightly lower than the previous settlement (i.e., the end of April). However, depositors seem dissatisfied. It has now been decided to raise the interest rate by 2 qian and 5 fen compared to the previous settlement, to 5 taels and 2 qian and 5 fen. It is reported that the amount of deposits has reached more than 40 million taels.</p>
<h3>The Lowest Interest Rate for Deposits Last Month</h3>
<p>(October) The number of days when the silver exchange rate was above the money rate was very few. Therefore, the total for the whole month was only 2 taels, 3 qian, and 6 fen. The average daily exchange rate was only 7 fen and 8 li. There were two holidays on the 1st and 10th. If the bottom line of 2 and a half taels of deposit interest can be reached, it is expected that a deposit interest proposal will be made tomorrow at a total of 2 taels, 5 qian, 9 fen, and 5 kou.</p>
<p>Securities and Public Debt Transactions Exceed 9.5 Million</p>
<p>96 Demobilization and 19 Customs Increase by More Than One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's bond market saw scarce spot transactions, but the futures market was more active than before the settlement. Bond prices rose uniformly. The demand for 96 bonds suddenly increased, and the price rose sharply between the two morning sessions, reaching a maximum of 18 yuan and several jiao. The market slightly contracted in the later sessions, but both near and far terms rose by 1 yuan and 3 jiao compared to the previous week. The 19th-year customs tax and demobilization issues also performed well. Various parties invested and received actively, and the price rose steadily in each session due to the relationship between supply and demand. As a result, the price rose by more than 1 yuan compared to before the settlement. Although other bonds also rose slightly across the board, the amount was only about 2 or 3 jiao. The total value of spot transactions for the whole day was only 19,000 yuan, and the value of futures transactions was 4.4 million in the morning and 5.1 million in the afternoon, totaling more than 9.5 million yuan. Among them, the 19th-year customs tax accounted for the largest share, followed by demobilization, and then 96 bonds, which accounted for more than 1.7 million. Troop reduction was next, and others were minor.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Markets Decline Following Overseas Cotton</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending downward, and the bearish sentiment is getting worse. This is due to sluggish actual sales and the impact of the decline in overseas cotton. Furthermore, the inventory of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn is quite large, and the sellers' momentum is stronger. However, some manufacturers are buying and holding onto far-term contracts, so the exchange market can still stand at around 50 taels. However, the future outlook depends on the current demand.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Suddenly Drops by Two Taels: The opening price of the Renbiao forward market fell as American cotton fell for two consecutive days. The market sentiment was relatively loose, and there were many sellers. Each month fell by 1 tael 1 qian to 5 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that some retail investors were covering short positions and rose slightly by 1 or 2 qian. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 13,100 bales. Among them, Zhengda sold 500 bales, and Tianlong sold 700 bales. The remaining 400 to 500 bales. Yiyu bought 2,250 bales, Tianchang bought 700 bales, Tianlong bought 600 bales, and Gongtai bought 1,200 bales. The remaining 500 to 600 bales. The closing prices of Renbiao are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>March 1502 2200 50</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Performs Well: Spot yarn sales are still strong. According to statistics, the total number of bales purchased by various groups throughout the day was 1,565. Peers imported 200 bales, Yunnan customers imported 215 bales, Jiangxi imported 40 bales, Guangdong imported 325 bales, Sichuan imported 600 bales, Xuzhou imported 35 bales, mainland China imported 140 bales, and miscellaneous groups imported 110 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Creates a Tragic Situation</h3>
<p>Long Positions Soften Amid Frequent Declines in American Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton market plummeted because American cotton, which had risen for nine consecutive days, suddenly fell for two consecutive days, causing floating long positions to shake, resulting in a tragic drop. The Ningbo group sold 20,000 to 30,000 dan, and the Han group also sold 5,000 to 6,000 dan. However, the Dongmian foreign firm purchased more than 10,000 dan. From a fundamental point of view, the cotton market did not have an active rising trend. The global supply of raw materials is sufficient. However, everyone previously expected the American cotton price to be 1 jiao per bale. Unexpectedly, the government's support was strong, and it suddenly rebounded by 150 pounds. Most retail investors eagerly covered short positions, which led to this sharp rise. Yesterday and today, it went back 40 pounds, and the cotton price is now trending downwards.</p>
<p>Hanbiao Drops Sharply by Seven Qian: The opening price of the Hanbiao forward market showed a weak trend, falling by 6 to 7 qian across the board. The market sentiment stabilized slightly in the afternoon, and each rose by 5 fen. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 81,800 dan. Among them, Maoji sold 2,300 dan, Shenchang sold 5,500 dan, Tongxing sold 5,300 dan, Hengyi sold 3,800 dan, and Yongfeng sold 2,400 dan. The remaining 1,500 to 1,600 dan. Yuanda bought 5,300 dan, Gongtai bought 3,200 dan, Hengyi bought 2,900 dan, and Yiyu bought 4,700 dan. The remaining 1,900 to 3,000 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Continues to Fall by Twenty Pounds</h3>

<h3>The Grain and River Rice Market is Firm</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the sources of various groups were more than 20 shops, and market sales were active. The sales of the latest top-grade goods were not smooth. The opening price was 14 yuan 7 or 8 jiao. Ordinary Zhongguan had a particularly large number of special sales transactions. Although there was a month-end settlement relationship, the buying interest was still not quiet, and the trend was tight. The big market looked good, and 13 yuan 8 or 9 jiao were offered. The opening price of thin rice was high at 13 yuan 5 jiao, similar to the previous day. Yangxian rice slightly had customer demand and rose nearly a jiao. The top-grade village rice was slightly firm, and the mid- and low-grades were fully raised by 1 to 2 jiao. The opening price of the best goods was 12 yuan 1 jiao. The arrival of branch-port pointed rice was very light, and the buying interest was strong. Retail sales were also active, so the price was raised by another jiao. The top opening price was 11 yuan 5 jiao. Due to the high cost of Ningbo, Wuhu, and Bengbu rice, the number of arriving cars was limited. Special top-grade rice was required at 11 yuan. New goods gradually arrived, and the trend was good. Various batches unanimously competed to enter, and the price increased by 2 jiao.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the river arrived with about 20 shops. The sales in this street were smooth. Changshu and Xigao were selling well in Nongchu due to the residual wind of the Zhabei market. The freight customers were also quite actively selling. According to the news from Lili Road, it was difficult for the Shanghai market to relax again, and the top-grade goods were required at 14 yuan 1 or 2 jiao. Sutongbai was very dull, and although the price was stable, the selection was very picky. The highest grade also required about 13 yuan. The price of South Road Qingjiao and Sijing rice remained unchanged. The arrival of various types of six-row rice was rare, and sales were flat. The opening price of the top-grade rice in Zhongguan was 13 yuan 3 jiao, which was raised by about 1 jiao. The source of Yangdujian rice was due to the inability of Tiangong to clear, and the prices of retail sales and customer demand were linked, with good prices and half a jiao. The opening price of special high-grade Yangxian rice was 11 yuan 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of This Month's Flour Delivery</h3>
<p>The Current Stock is 100,000 Bags... China Recovers More Than 60,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was no market for futures due to delivery. There were still customers for spot #2 flour, but #3 and #4 flour and bran were very sluggish. The market price of bran fell, and the spot price was only 2 li and 1 qian, which was 1 li 7 or 8 qian less than the beginning of spring. #4 flour from Shansi also saw a decline and lacked sales. The current stock of this month totals 100,000 bags, all of which were re-released from the holdings of a certain large long position at the end of last month. Among them, China recovered more than 60,000 bags. In addition, customers received 10,000 bags, and the remaining were taken in by groups of sellers. China accounted for 77,000 bags, 9 accounted for 10,000, and Xinda accounted for 13,000. The futures trading was still good, totaling 9,086,000 bags (unit: 1,000 bags).</p>

<h3>Pongee and Eastern Pongee Decline in Reaction</h3>
<p>Changing to the Gregorian Calendar for Settlement... Smaller Account Trading</p>
<p>Large Batches of Flannel Arrive in Shanghai... The Downward Trend Cannot Be Halted</p>
<p>Pongee Market: The market has been quite sluggish and shows a sharp downward trend. The reason for this is that the previous rising trend was too strong, and there should have been a reaction. However, the year-end settlement of the Gregorian calendar also has a great impact. In previous years, this was the peak of the autumn sales season, and wholesale companies maximized their account extensions. All department stores needed as much goods as possible, hence the saying "Three Springs are exhausted in one Winter." Now, the National Government has issued the Gregorian calendar, and the money industry has announced its implementation. Therefore, everyone is afraid. The reason is that the accounts extended at this time must be settled at the latest in December of the Gregorian calendar. After going to Shanghai, they are too late to be delivered. Therefore, local customers have uniformly reduced their accounts, resulting in a sharp decline in demand. In addition, flannel has arrived in large quantities, so the downward trend is great. Yesterday, Zhonghua and Yuehua flannel were already 2 qian. Guannan Kui was only sold at 1 qian 9 and a half fen, and Fuhua Jiufen 7.5 li was also willing to sell. Shuang Shui Lang flannel suddenly decreased to 2 qian 2 fen 2.5 li. Black flower flannel has already been sold at 1 qian 9 fen 7 li, which is 5 li less than Monday. Zhigong satin is also soft. Shuangyi and Shima and other Zhigong satins are 2 qian 7 fen. Zhigong ni and thin fabrics have not changed because the spot price is still falling. Bleached cloth shows a tendency to hoard. Fushou Samsung 9 liang 7 qian and Queqiao Hui 11 liang spot goods are still scarce. Western goods have started to be ordered and traded in recent days, with about 40 to 50 pieces of cloth such as linen yarn, poplin, etc.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dali Sugar Opens at 30,000 Bags and is Very Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's district telegram stated that the price of Cuban spot sugar was 1.375, which was 0.3125 lower than the previous telegram. The price of New York futures sugar for December was 1.39, which was 5 points lower. The price for March next year was 1.49, and the price for May was 1.55, both of which were unchanged. The price for June was 1.67, which was also 1 point lower. The price of Javanese spot sugar was 8.375, and the prices of futures sugar for November and December were both 8 shields, which were also lacking upward movement compared to the previous day. The Guild's coarse sand white sugar was quite firm, and the transaction price was 7 taels and 9 qian, slightly higher to 7 taels and 9 qian and a half. The market for finely ground sand white sugar at 7 taels and 9 qian and a half was also quite popular. The market for #20 medium sand white sugar at 6 taels and 8 qian and a half was relatively flat. The market for #8 Dutch red sugar at 6 taels and 4 qian was also in demand. Spot price for bowl blue sugar was 6 taels and 7 qian and a half. The market was also popular. Japanese sugar J mark was quoted at 8 taels and 1 qian and a half but there were few buyers. YT mark was 7 taels and 6 qian and a half, YRO mark was 7 taels and 3 qian and a half, and YP mark was 7 taels and 9 qian. The market was also uneven. Dali sugar was on sale for 30,000 bags at the factory price of 4 yuan 7 jiao and a half in Japanese gold. The corrected delivery date was February, with new tax regulations. The market atmosphere was very strong. Xin Hua sold 200 tons of coarse sand white sugar for delivery next month for 6 yuan and 2 and a half fen in Dutch currency, and sold 50 tons of bowl blue for spot delivery for 6 taels and 6 qian. The market was generally good. Shuihua Qing's board opened with dozens of bags at 7 taels and 4 qian and a half per yuan, followed by 7 taels and 1 qian, which was also quite average.</p>
<h3>Southern and Northern Goods: Xiamen Tangerine Cakes Are About to Run Out</h3>
<p>Xiamen tangerine cakes have been out of stock for a long time, and the Shanghai market goods industry has already made a report. The industry has also checked that the hand stock is limited and will soon run out. Yesterday, the market was selling for 17 taels. It was heard that the number of stocks in Zhangzhou was small, and the prices were firm. The transfer to Shanghai was also not smooth, so it is feared that there will be no continued arrival for the time being. Currently, the needs of all parties are temporarily being met by the cakes from this factory.</p>
<h3>Seafood and Agar-Agar Sales are Dull, Mushroom Market is Stable</h3>
<p>"Agar-Agar": The customer sales period has already passed, and due to the peak in prices, transactions have become even more sluggish. Yesterday, the board opening price for Tianxue brand was 276 taels and 8 qian, Jinhe brand was 271 taels and 5 qian, Yujie brand was 262 taels, and Baiyu brand was 263 taels and 8 qian. Each stall price was 3, 5, or 6 or 7 taels lower than the previous board, but the companies had little intention of purchasing. It was heard that there were a total of 45 pieces of goods arriving, and the number of pieces sold yesterday was less than half.</p>
<p>"Mushrooms": In recent days, the sales of both local and inland groups have been healthy, so the market has turned positive. Yesterday, the wholesale price for whole large slices was 168 taels, even slices were 146 taels, and mixed goods were 140 taels, which was about 10 taels higher than the market price ten days ago.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Premium Mei and Pearl Tea Sales to England Continue to be Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the road merchants and local merchants, as well as the Yingzhuang Xiehe, Yihua, Tongfu, and Tianxiang shops continued to buy Premium Mei and Pearl teas. Transactions were still active, but the selling opening price was still not high and there was a tendency to decline. The Russian silk and tea merchants of Gongxi were still buying goods of good quality. However, the selection of mid- to low-grade goods was very strict. However, most of the existing goods in the market were mid- to low-grade tea. It was extremely difficult to clear the existing stock in the midst of this rising and falling.</p>
<h3>Hardware English Galvanized Iron Increases by 2 Qian 5 Fen</h3>
<p>Regardless of the color, the source of English galvanized iron is drying up and the sales channels are smooth, so the market is very good. Yesterday, the market rose by another 2 qian 5 fen, such as 48 sheets at 16 taels for 5 dengs, 38 sheets at 15 taels 2 qian 5 fen, 33 sheets at 14 taels 5 qian, 25 sheets at 12 taels 5 qian, and 21 sheets at 13 taels. It was heard that 48 sheets and 33 sheets were the most popular because the spot goods were very short. Various groups were buying to meet their needs. Recently, the stock of English galvanized iron was only more than 4,000 dan, which may not be enough for one month's sales. Therefore, the market outlook is bound to be very optimistic.</p>

<h3>Foreign Province People and Cantonese People</h3>
<p>— A Lesson</p>
<p>In any school, one can often hear the terms "Cantonese people" and "Foreign Province people". Especially in our school, the tone of "He is Cantonese" or "He is from another province" easily reaches your ears as long as you can walk around the dormitory or sports field twice in our school.</p>
<p>"Cantonese people" refers to people from Guangdong, which does not need explanation. "Foreign Province people" refers to people from the vast Yangtze River region or from several provinces north of it in our country. Shanghai, as a golden area, has thriving commerce and a large population, resulting in a countless number of schools. Why are these two terms particularly sung to each other in schools? The reason is simple: the two kinds of people have very different characteristics.</p>
<p>It is widely acknowledged that Cantonese people are rich in rebelliousness, adventurousness, and courage. Just consider why only people from Guangdong and Fujian provinces travel to the South Seas to do business among the seven coastal provinces, and the reason becomes clear. Because of their above-mentioned characteristics, the term "Cantonese people" is contrasted with the term "Foreign Province people", which is associated with several provinces. These contrasting terms often fill the air in schools.</p>
<p>Now, let me list a few major differences.</p>
<p>In terms of hygiene, just take bathing as an example. In cold weather, Cantonese people go to the bathhouse at least three or four times a week. In hot weather, bathing once a day is a given, and even two or three times a day is common. However, Foreign Province people, in cold weather, they simply don't know about bathing. During the hot summer vacation, they might bathe once or twice (perhaps there are exceptions, but they are undoubtedly in the minority). Here is an interesting anecdote that two Foreign Province classmates told me personally, which vividly demonstrates the characteristics of Foreign Province people. The first time, in cold weather, I shared a room with a local classmate. Therefore, we often discussed opening windows and bathing. I tried to persuade that classmate to bathe more often and like opening windows like us, but the only result I got was him saying, "The reason why you (referring to us Cantonese people) like opening windows and bathing so much is because Guangdong is near the sea and has close contact with foreigners, so Cantonese people are like foreigners." Another time, also in winter, I was persuading a Sichuan classmate to take a bath, but he replied to me, "Cantonese people have a kind of body odor, so they like to bathe. We don't have body odor, so we don't need to." Alas, to hear such words spoken in a solemn and dignified manner from the mouths of so-called students receiving higher education truly raises a big question about Chinese education.</p>
<p>Other things, like wearing cotton robes, long gowns, and cotton robe trousers to play ball, can still be considered somewhat open-minded and know the word "exercise". However, there are even those who consider exercise shameful, those who see singing and dancing as strange, those who tightly close their windows and spit fog and swallow clouds, smoking cigarettes in the room, making the entire room so filled with smoke that things cannot be seen from a short distance, those who use washbasins with phlegm at the bottom to hold water in the public water basin in the washroom, those who spit phlegm everywhere and think they have succeeded, and those who suddenly hear a Cantonese word "fight" and turn pale and shrink their heads in fear and run away. The various situations are truly too numerous to mention. In other words, at a time when the modern national tide is surging, most Foreign Province people still want to learn to fan themselves with a white fan in their left hand and stroke their beards with their right hand, engaging in idle talk, holding textbooks and reciting rotten phrases all day long. They are completely oblivious to all the trends and waves, as if they are in a cloud. Can this kind of people inspire the Chinese nation? Is it possible to hope that China can also be an outstanding leading actor on the international stage with this kind of people? Alas, Foreign Province people, let's keep up with the trend and stop dreaming.</p>
