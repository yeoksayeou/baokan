<p>原夫國家之常則。自應各國之人民自用其本國自有之貨物或因特産之貨。非本國之所有者。乃不得已而購之於他國。故世界之所謂通商。原其初意。不過各國以殊特之貨。互相交易。以通有無而已。至於人生日用所需。各國旣各有其土地。自必各有所生産。即有精粗美惡之不同。苟但爲生活計。當無一國不可以自給。無取乎外來。自世人尙新奇。好炫異。而推廣貨物之國家。又百計以誘人購買。於是一新貨出貨市塲。而舊者皆爲之排斥。工業落後之國。乃至物物皆爲他國侵略。此近年以來情狀也。夫此情狀。非但毎年購買他國貨物。金錢之流出無窮。苟一旦外貨不至。本國舊有之工業。旣被淘汰而廢棄。則日用所需。亦將束手而不能自給。此其危險爲何如乎。今日世界之人。漸漸有感及此。故各國均有主張自用國貨者。據記載所及。中國已頒布國貨使用命令。英國發起購買國貨獎勵。德國鼓吹國貨實用之誡。法國强制購用國貨小麥。竟國制定國貨使用法。凡此諸國。皆彰彰在人耳目者。苟能實力進行。不數年後將見各國國民自作自用之常態。而所謂商業過分競爭。因而轉至受衰落之恐慌者。可以稍减矣。</p>

<p>一男客（在一個一二百人的大宴會中。向一不甚相識的女客搭話。）—今天的宴會大極了。男女賓客。彼此不相識的很多。我連主人都不認識。</p>
<p>一女客—那麽先生怎麽來的。</p>
<p>一男客—我是被一個朋友拉來的。可是來了之後很覺懊悔。你瞧那主人眞是一個天字第一號的吝嗇鬼。這樣惡劣的菜。怎能請客。夫人。你也認識那主人麽。</p>
<p>一女客—對不起得很。他恰恰是我的丈夫。</p>
<p>男—吾愛。昨夜我做了一個夢。夢中在向你求婚。這不知是何徵兆。</p>

<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>余友劉君曉光。于三閲月前隨前江蘇民政廳長繆丕成氏赴日考察。日昨公畢返國。吾社同人。設筵爲之洗塵。席間述三島風情。見聞隨感。頗多足紀者。爰爲述之</p>
<p>東京地震後之復興　東京地震。爲日本有史以來。最重大之損失爲値幾逹數百萬萬然今游其地。則崇樓傑閣。燦然悅目。市政上一切建設、若馬路公園之類。較地震前尤進步多多。欲求地震時之敗瓦頽垣遺跡。直不可得且日人鑒于地震爲禍之烈。故復興時代之建築。異常堅固。未雨綢繆日人之毅力可欽矣。</p>
<p>棒球之狂熱　日人對於棒球。有不可思議之狂熱。某日爲全國中等學校比賽大會。售票前一日之夜。球塲前已滿佈蓬帳。蓋觀者恐無票可購。故不惜冒風霜以坐待也。觀者旣衆其鵠立稍後者。苦不能窺全豹。于是臨時有出洋售油箱者。代價數元。使觀者可以高立。一時生涯鼎盛搶購一空。曾有一人。因被擠足部受傷匆匆出塲去。在醫院略一包裹急又趕來。其熱烈狀况。眞爲世所罕見。</p>
<p>主婦之勤儉　日人對於婦女之主持家政不外務者。極爲重視。而若輩之儉樸尤爲難能劉君謂嘗見一富家。財産不下數十萬。然其主婦躬操井臼。不假手于一僕。惟對花木則又有獨嗜。其花園中。松樹甚多。特聘名匠整理毎日工資五角。歷時三月。始告完成。所費則又不下數百元。</p>
<p>公用傘　日人崇尙誠實。其效力蓋可于細微處覘之公共處所。常有公用傘可借値天雨。行人之未備雨具者。可任取其一。用畢仍歸原處。其久借不歸者。未之前聞。</p>
<p>廢有趣味之國家　日本對于科學固竭力研求。而同時對于固有舊道德。亦未嘗輕。故在外人視之。其矛盾之點甚多。然日人獨能融新舊思想于一爐有如水乳。事亦難能。故西人多稱之爲有趣味之國家云。</p>
<p>不景氣之一斑　報章所載日本之不景氣抵日後更顯見之。日本大都市。其百貨大公司如先施永安者。不下數十。然一入其中。則顧客寥寥。門庭異常冷落。失業恐慌。隨處可見政府救濟之法。不外借貸資本。俾得謀生或發放賑品。免民凍餒。然成效殊微。最趣者。即失業者常以一大木架上書人履歷。置于通衢。人立架後。以待招聘。亦云苦矣。</p>
<p>天皇之崇拜狂　日人對于天皇。虔敬萬分奉之有如神明。成人無論矣。即一般小學生。亦皆如此。劉君參觀一小學校。時適散學。諸生過天皇像下。一一致最敬禮。肅穆莊嚴。令人可佩。啓迪之得。從可知矣。</p>
<p>傷心處不禁下涙　劉君考察所得。覺日本之淬勵精進。發揚蹈厲。以數十年之時間。蔚爲世界富强文明之邦。其間人民之訓練。政治之設置。與我國相較。直令人置身無地。偶與人談天。至傷心之處。不禁泣下。國人聞之。宜知所勉矣。</p>

<p>— 陳俊三</p>
<p>日前報載持志學院劉君。因返家午膳。穿過校前鐵軌適機車自淞疾馳而來。　避不及。受傷慘死。</p>
<p>劉君吾夜友也。性和藹。長文學。擅交際。尤與某女士等交最善。噩耗傳來。不勝驚悼。然使君不與某女士（歷任皇后）有深厚之感情。曷至自法政轉學遠東。遠東停辦。仍回法政。后聞某女士入持志。今春又轉持志。三遷其校。竟罹斯禍。天乎痛哉。</p>

<p>— 孑予</p>
<p>日本野人食生物。嘗一席人公開表演於大世界。頃紹友何君來申。爲談東浦捕蛇阿寳之怪性。與日本野人較。有過之。無不及焉。爰亟爲錄刋。以餉閲者。</p>
<p>阿寳。陳姓。幼時。學業錢肆。辨認銀洋。無需目覩。遥聆其聲。即識　鼎及長。乖戾暴恣。揮霍無度。家産盡被傾蕩。聲名遂致狼藉。而又知過不悛。終日浮浪。殊不措意於謀生。妻早亡。遺一女。已嫁鰥居斗室。未嘗言貧。但眼光甚銳。黑夜能辨纖屑。村人遂凂之守更。央求再四。勉爲充任焉。東浦以産酒名。富室皆自造。自寳任更夫徹宵逹旦。柝韻不絶。酒具露置。亦不慮損失。不慣謀生徧能盡職。爲人已足奇已。</p>
<p>年六十餘。面黧睛亦。傴僂猙獰。猶晝伏夜出矍鑠將事。生平最喜食毒物。蛇蛙·蜘蛛·蜈蚣·壁虎·　蚰·及其他齷齪昆蟲。一遭其手。無一倖免。且整體活呑。不洗亦不嚼。即不然。微沾齒頰。及死下咽。費時亦指顧間耳。</p>
<p>至其食蛇。先咬去頭。對頸吮血。然後帶骨和皮。齗齗咀嚼津津然也。蛇身之大者須與高梁酒共食。否則半條足以果腹。過多將嫌太飽矣。人有知其性者。恒持酒嬲之。　則探囊捉蛇。即爲表演。蓋非惟藉此鳴奇。抑亦心之所喜也。</p>
<p>某年有西醫某。曾出五百金購其身體。將終其天年而解剖之。大世界主人。亦嘗聞其奇。出包銀聘請來滬。均經寳拒絶。不果。又當炎熱蒸悶之天。傍其身而過。惡臭奇腥。令人不耐。其膚肉之特異。於此可見。</p>
<p>誌謝與介紹　本埠海寗路渭安坊安全行近製成羊牌機片兩用油一種。定價毎瓶六角。此油用以滴入唱機。能使機器不發生轉動遲滯。快慢不匀以及大小發條爆斷輪齒損壞等弊。兼可揩抺唱片。昨承惠贈二瓶。特此誌謝。兼爲介紹。</p>

<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>（一）伐諦康Ｖaticana即現在敎皇宮傍之美術館。範圍之廣。可推世界第一。巴黎羅佛。尙不能比擬。據領導者言。陳列室共有八百餘間。不僅建築之大。即歷史上著名之美術品。亦甚爲豐富。文藝復興三大藝傑之作品。都在其中。其餘凡世界稀有之古雕刻及工藝。品亦不計其數。余連觀二日。茲將幾張重要之名畫。記述於後。</p>
<p>樓上有拉飛爾壁畫四大間。題材皆宗敎。當時有其生徒所助繪惟其中有二幅。是拉飛爾之親筆。（拉氏手洪上面已説過。）尙有拉飛爾走廊。長一里餘。從前是羅馬敎皇之住宅。拉飛爾畫此走廊。頗得敎皇之寵。現在爲紀念拉氏。故以此名之。出走廊向左進内。有大陳列室六間都。近代意大利人之宗敎畫。手法傾向寫實。色彩鮮麗。仍不失古代繪畫之傳統。</p>
<p>（一）西司帝儂Sistina殿堂　此堂聞名於世界。内有米葛朗極羅的天井畫及名作「最後之審判」。那幅天井畫。是一千五百○八年動手。至一千五百二十二年完成。爲米氏絶世的大作。天井中央皆描寫創造世紀中的事件。其重要畫題。是「伊甸的樂園」。「樂園追放」。「及人類創造」分布三面。其次描寫「洪水」。表出人類的絶望。恐怖。戰慄。激怒。暴勇。悲哀等等極端的感情。再看其中所描的神。爲無限的自然力的具體化。逹於最上嚴峻。此畫成功後。隔開二十年。再畫正中之大壁畫。第二次驚人的傑作。就是「最後之審判」。原作高十餘丈。闊六丈餘。同時看米氏兩大傑作。其作風不同。天井畫富裝飾。「最後之審判」一圖。重緊張力。處處以人力的緊張。表出神化。第二次傑作。米氏共畫七年。其畫中央是基督。左爲瑪利亞。右爲使徒及殉敎者。各負刑具。對基督訴寃。右邊上方。有天使擁十字架飛來。又有七個天使。大吹喇叭。使墓中的死耆復蘇。大家來受最後之審判。有的得永刼的幸福。有的送人常　的地獄。畫中各部。都有生氣。這兩張大畫。實爲文藝復興期藝術的精髓。米氏有那種偉大藝術的創造。後人常稱其爲英雄模範的藝術家。試不虚也</p>
<p>當米氏描寫「最後之審判」。受但丁文學的影響甚大。該畫下面一部分。畫船中乘客將要傾翻的光景。那種緊張的表現。都由但丁的詩意上表的。</p>
<p>殿堂中二大傑作之外。尙有文藝復興初期的名作十餘點因所懸地位甚高。不復詳細參觀。</p>
<p>羅馬古物之多。不是短文中可以記述。上面所寫。僅依余個人參觀後的一些印象。其重要的。還是在關於藝術方面。其他名勝及歷史等。恕不多述。</p>

<p>第十五回　四廂彈涙惆悵紅情　一座傾心低徊綠意</p>
<p>殷大少爺暗暗想。這番根生是中了我的計了。但是走下馬車來一看。心裏有點駭然。原來這一條衖堂。便是自已的産業。早知如此。自已跑來就是了。何必遠兜轉的要根生領來。不想爺藏嬌金屋。却就是息已的寳産裏。可笑我們都瞞在鼓當中咧。依着根生的吩咐。走進了衖堂裏第五家。却見門上貼了一張條子。是寫着某某地産公司事務所。他想這可不對了。怎麽是個地産公司呢。不要是根生滑頭。指東話西。上了他的當嗎。他看了房子的坐落。和門牌的號頭。便回到馬車裏來。説道。根生。不對呀。那是一家地産公司。你不要記差了。不是第五家吧。根生笑道。那得會記差。一天也要來幾趟。地産公司就是小公館。小公館就是地産公司。到底大少爺聰明。他是看過偵探書的。一會兒便悟過來了。他説原來那個地産公司是虚設的嗎。不過掩人耳目而已。根生道。那也不見得。聽説余舅老爺們。本來是要設立一個地産公司。和我們老爺商量了。就設在那裏。姨太太一個人住在那裏。要不了這許多房子。所以姨太太是住了一個樓面。樓下就算是地産公司。好在地産公司裏。一個人也没得。連他們開會也向别處開去。總算有一張寫字樓。有一架信箱。變隻椅子。也都是老爺呌本衖堂的經租帳房潘先生去辦的。橫竪是自已房子。不出錢的。樓下也不便租給别人家了。所以設立了個地産公司。其實樓下是一個人也没有的。不是你瞧大門都緊閉着了嗎。要眞是一個公司。出出進進的人很多。大門那裏關得住呢。大少爺想。爺爺設什麽地産公司。他是置買一項活動的地産嗎。因問這是的確老爺的小公館嗎。根生道。自然是的。那得會差。本來我是不能領你們來看的。旣然老爺自已説穿了。自然也不關我事了。大少爺道。我怕你把第幾家弄差了。回頭我來接姨太太時。跑到别人家屋子裏去。不是要鬧出笑話來嗎。旣然不差的。那就是了。大少爺居然這一天。把爺爺的小公館也都認淸了。總算對於母親。不爲無功。覺得這兩百塊也不是白拿的。欽命查辦事件。到明天便可以覆命了。他也再三叮囑了根生。老爺回來了。切不可以説起。根生自然不關他他。也不肯説起咧。</p>

<p>袁順武呼救無從</p>
<p>車夫咳嗽吃耳光</p>
<p>中山路大夏大學商科二年級學生袁順武、昨日下午六時半、由校門對面之祿中會西菜室晚餐完畢回校、經過中山路、突被綁匪多人架上事前預備之汽車、向北開去、因該地係六區所轄、當由該校學生會派時照沅赴六區總署報告袁順武被綁情形、請求緝拿、任區長得報後、立時下令全班武裝及各派出所、分頭偵察、直至晚間十一時許、尙無眉目、茲將被綁經過情形、分别詳紀如下、</p>
<p>綁匪租車昨日下午五時十五分、有一穿白灰色及黑色長衫者兩人、年約三十左右、口操北音、向西藏路汕路口友寗汽車公司租車應用、自稱劉姓、當由賬房簽定華界照會四四一七租界照會一八零五五號雪佛蘭轎車、由車夫朱興棠開出、穿黑衫者坐前面、白衫者坐後面、車夫問往何處、匪云到閘北去、當車開過新閘橋北堍時、匪命停車、坐後面者下車、又命開往共和新路、較爲冷落之處、有一似爲會館房屋之旁停下、又有三人上車、兩人着長衫、一係黑色、一係白灰色、另一係黑色短裝、三人上車後、又命由中山路開往曹家渡、中途或命停車、回時又突來兩人、一係白灰色長衫、一係短裝、並出手槍對車夫云、「你下來、對不起、車子借用用、」車夫下車後、即被兩匪拉往路旁墳山草地内看守、車由餘匪向南開去、　　車夫被摑車夫被兩匪拉入草地内、命其坐下、並禁止聲張、車夫因氣急咳嗽一聲、即被一匪力捆一下、並云「不好嚮的、你知道嗎、」在草地内靜坐約一小時之譜、適天下微雨、匪始云、「你現在好回去了、」兩匪即朝北揚長而去、車夫乃沿中山路南行、走約廿餘分鐘、始到大夏校旁、詢人此地警局在何處、並述此事經過、始悉借車匪衆即來綁大夏學生、當有人代僱黃包車、赴六區總署報告、</p>
<p>綁架情形袁順武由餐室走出時、與同宿舍之同學（宿舍係羣力齋、二百三十七號、）虞德元·陳憲和·兩人並肩而出、談笑自若、詎知走過中山路時、忽見有一汽車由南向北掉頭、機門並不關閉、同時有一持電筒者向三人面部一照、當有一持手槍之匪向前將袁順武架上汽車、向北極速開去、當袁順武架上汽車時、陳·虞·兩人亦無法營救、只聞得袁順武有喊救之聲、但似即被匪衆閉住其口、遂未聞有繼續聲晌、</p>
<p>袁家境况據袁順武同鄉同學葉謜云、袁君係湖北武昌人、今年十九歲、家住漢口、其父在漢開設袁瑞泰營造廠、表面似屬甚好、内容實屬不佳、袁君所讀係商科、本學期已到二年級、滬上並無家屬、此次被綁、或係誤認、因袁君實際並無被綁之資格也、又袁君近似患有神經衰弱症、昨日下午四時許、曾同葉謜乘本校公用汽車至大統路請某醫生診斷、</p>
<p>警署嚴緝此事發生後、當由大夏學生會派學生時照沅携帶袁君最近照片投報六區總署、報告經過、請求嚴緝、同時汽車夫朱興棠亦到區報告綁匪租車之經過、任署長得報後、以事出本轄境内、職員攸關、立即親自飭令徐巡官率領巡邏班及偵緝隊全體人員、全副武裝、四出兜緝、同時飭令各派出所一體注意、並通知四區總署、請其飭令所屬會同偵察、當記者至六區總署時、任署長徐巡官已回總署、正在研究偵緝方法及佈置計劃、</p>

<p>西人以業餘外出旅游爲樂事、國人則以出門爲不得已之舉、蓋舟車上下、有如拚命逃生、跼躅一隅、亦無異監獄中之生涯也、記者因南旋、搭乘津浦車、距離不過千里、而費時則一晝夜、困頓之餘、筋骨皆痛、休養一夕、猶未復原、聞濟浦間旅客有因睡車頂過鐵橋而摔至橋下、骨肉紛碎者、不禁毛髮悚然、幸喜尙未至登車頂之地步也津濟間通車已旬日而售二等車票則僅二日、聞係津局王端庭處長去濟交涉之結果、但車雖有二等、而實際上僅有包房五間、津局朱侶雲副局長已佔其一、餘則悉爲裕中利順德飯店洋人及中國貴賓預定、記者臨時欲購一張二等車票、頗遭售票生之白眼、謂須先一日定購包房、不售臨時單身票也、記者憤而欲購三等票、但實際上車票早已過車輛所容之額、即欲購票、亦須循序排至百餘鄉愿之後、計算離開車時間僅半小時、恐結果將遭屏棄、乃忍氣呑聲、向站長交涉通融、幸蒙援助得在二等車包房臥室外、覓一席地、出二等車票、而蹲在臥室門外、旣不敢長臥、亦不得危襟坐、屈腰盤腿、有如蝸牛、眞奇遇也、</p>
<p>開車原定上午七時三十分、但機車往返轉動之際、則已將近八時矣、鄉民之已購得票者、均爭上頂、後排之一字長隊、見售票房閉小窗、猶不肯散、大抵即將如次排列、候至翌晨矣、車過良王莊、記者爲好奇以所驅使、乃在人堆中攀出、前往三等車中參觀、自窗外向内逼視、但見人頭摇動、亦不識究有若干、小孩因被擠、多啼哭不休、婦女則喂乳亦難轉身、而車頂上高踞者、尙自鳴得意、以爲居然趕上車、而忘晚間寒風剌骨、雨水澆淋之苦矣、</p>
<p>車過滄州、停甚久、信步站台出口氣、見「精神革命」之標語、猶依然現於車站邊牆、念此站當去年蔣北上之際晋軍將領傅作義李生逹及前市長崔廷獻、伴同何成𤀹乘專車在此等候、爲期不過一載�、乃因叛變而作寓公、名將聲威、亦如費河濁流逝去、不禁嘆世事之滄桑矣、</p>

<h3 id="e2">Sino-Russian Conference Not Completely Suspended <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Wu Zesheng Denies Mo’s Return to China</p>
<p>The Point of Contention Lies in the Boli Record</p>
<p>(Harbin) Wu Zesheng, the secretary of our delegation at the Sino-Russian Conference, returned to Harbin on the 24th. At noon, he visited various parties to report on the conference situation. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) A reporter interviewed Wu Zesheng on the afternoon of the 24th, who spoke freely, saying that the Sino-Russian Conference had not been completely suspended. The point of contention was the issue of recognizing the Boli Record. Plenipotentiary Mo had telegraphed the central government for instructions. After the reply arrives, the conference will continue. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already instructed the diplomatic team to discuss this matter, and a decision is expected soon. He himself will return to Russia with the newly appointed four special commissioners after their announcement. The newly appointed four special commissioners are Zhang Shouyi, the negotiator of Heihe, recommended by the Northeast, and Wang Mingzhi, the secretary of the Border Defense Command. The rumor that Mo Dehui is returning to China is not accurate. He still meets with Karakhan once a week, but they do not discuss the conference. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources say that the Sino-Russian Conference has indeed become impossible to continue. Our representative Mo has decided to return home for instructions. When the conference decided to be held in Russia, our side was initially unwilling to go. Later, feeling constrained by certain regulations, we had no choice but to go, hoping that after the conference started, the Russian side would not make excessive demands, and a solution could be reached. However, after our representative Mo arrived in Russia, he was monitored by the Russians everywhere. Mo's residence was also designated by the Russians, and the servants were all Russians. The instructions sent by China were also detained by the Russians. Recently, the Russian side has also demanded that our side recognize the Boli Record and has not fully withdrawn its troops from the border, showing no sincerity in the negotiations. Under these circumstances, Representative Mo had no choice but to return home temporarily. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Foreign sources say that the rumor spread by Japanese telegrams that Mo Dehui is returning to China due to the breakdown of the Sino-Russian Conference is not accurate. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Post-War Northwest Issues <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the overall plan for the surrender of the Northwest Army, Zhang Zhijiang and Li Mingzhong are currently in Shanghai negotiating with Chiang Kai-shek. Li Xin, the representative of Lu Zhonglin, and others have also gone to Shanghai to await instructions. It is said that the central government may give the Northwest Army an opportunity to devote themselves to border defense, rural pacification, and other matters regarding reorganization and stationing, which should be handled by the central government. As for those who still insist on their own ideas and so-called conditional obedience, it would be difficult to accommodate them. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Political sources say that the post-war affairs of the Northwest are complex and numerous. In the future, there may be the establishment of a Northwest Political Affairs Commission, with Ma Fuxiang being the most likely candidate for the position of chairman. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ji Hongchang left Beijing on the morning of the 24th to return to his defense area, actively reorganizing his troops.

<p>(Nanjing) Liang Guanying's representative, Zeng Xiaoyuan, said that Liang had a deep historical relationship with Ma Fuxiang, Li Mingzhong, and Zhang Zhijiang. This time, he is grateful for the attention of Ma, Li, and Zhang, and is extremely moved. His troops are currently in Guide, intensifying reorganization and training, and are willing to be the vanguard in suppressing bandits. Liang plans to enter Beijing to personally request instructions from Chairman Chiang after he returns to Beijing. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhenhua, along with his entourage Fan Runfang and others, crossed the river on the evening of the 24th and took a special train north to visit his relatives in Tianjin. Before leaving, Liu told people that this trip was entirely a private matter. He would stay in Tianjin for about three to five days and then go south to Henan to handle the post-war affairs of the Northwest in accordance with the central government's wishes. Liu also sent a long letter to Sun Lianzhong on the 24th, which was forwarded by his representative Li Hanhui, hoping that he would return soon and obey the central government. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Xin, the representative of Lu Zhonglin, and others are scheduled to return to Beijing from Shanghai on the 25th because the Northwest Army is anxiously awaiting news. They will return to Jiaozuo to report the results of this trip to Lu, so that a resolution can be reached as soon as possible. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Personnel of the Pingxi Army are sending letters to Zhang Zhijiang and Li Mingzhong, expressing their willingness to serve. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Guanjun, a division commander of the Feng Faction, sent a telegram to disarm and return to his hometown, saying that his 6,000 troops had only received 3,000 yuan in several months, and that the local supply in Liaocheng was more than 20,000 yuan, making it difficult to provide supplies. He is returning to Tianjin to recuperate. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">The National Goods Movement in the World <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Originally, the normal principle of a country is that the people of each country should use goods produced in their own country, or goods that are special products. If goods are not produced domestically, then it is unavoidable to purchase them from other countries. Therefore, the original intention of so-called international trade is nothing more than countries trading unique goods to exchange what they have for what they lack. As for the necessities of daily life, each country has its own land and will naturally have its own production. Even if there are differences in refinement, quality, and appearance, as long as it is for the sake of life, there should be no country that cannot be self-sufficient, and there is no need for foreign goods. However, people value novelty and like to show off different things, and countries that promote goods go to great lengths to induce people to buy. As a result, when a new product enters the market, the old ones are rejected. Countries with backward industries are even invaded by other countries in every aspect. This is the situation in recent years. This situation not only results in the endless outflow of money to purchase foreign goods every year, but also, if foreign goods do not arrive, the country's original industries, which have been eliminated and abandoned, will not be able to supply daily necessities. How dangerous is this? Today, people around the world are gradually becoming aware of this, so countries are advocating the use of domestic goods. According to records, China has promulgated orders for the use of domestic goods, Britain has launched a campaign to encourage the purchase of domestic goods, Germany is promoting the necessity of using domestic goods, France is forcing the purchase of domestic wheat, and Czechoslovakia has enacted a law on the use of domestic goods. All these countries are clearly visible to everyone. If they can carry out their plans with strength, in a few years, we will see the normal state of people in each country producing and using their own goods. The fear of excessive commercial competition leading to decline can be alleviated somewhat.</p>

<h3 id="e59">The Worldwide Movement to Promote the Use of National Products <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>China:: Promulgates Orders on the Use of National Products</p>
<p>England:: Launches "Buy National Products Week"</p>
<p>Germany:: Promotes the Practical Application of National Products through Admonitions</p>
<p>France:: Mandates the Use of Domestic Wheat</p>
<p>Italy:: Establishes a National Products Usage Law</p>
<p>The World Society states that due to general economic downturns, countries around the world are striving to protect their industries. Externally, they are discounting goods and raising tariffs against each other. Internally, they are launching movements to promote the use of national products, which has already become a global trend. The following is an investigation into the situation of the national product promotion movement in various countries:</p>
<p>China's promotion of national products is gradually taking on a sustained economic character, establishing national product exhibition halls, national product department stores, and national product sales outlets. It has also issued orders on the purchase and use of national products. Furthermore, it is considering establishing national product research institutes and national product banks to reward national products and reduce tariffs and transportation costs.</p>
<p>England, in order to break through the postwar difficulties, has launched a "Buy National Products Week" by the Patriotic Women's League. During this period, efforts are made to encourage the purchase of goods with the slogan "These items are all national products." In addition, it has launched a national product purchase incentive movement, domestic cotton fabric weeks, and so on.</p>
<p>Germany, whose propaganda for promoting the use of national products is the most outstanding, has ten commandments for vigorously promoting the use of national products: 1. Do not display foreign food on your table. 2. German-made paper must be written on with German-made pens and ink, and German-made blotting paper must be used. 3. Only German-made flour, fruits, and wine can truly imbue you with German energy. 4. If you do not like German-made coffee, drink coffee from German colonies. 5. Your clothes should be made of German cotton fabric, and your head should be crowned with a German-made hat.</p>
<p>France recently mandated that foreign canned goods must clearly indicate the country of origin. For bread making, it mandates the use of domestic wheat flour.</p>
<p>Italy enacted a law in 1926 stating that "when national administrative agencies, local autonomous bodies, and legal entities under national protection and supervision purchase goods, priority shall be given to national products at a premium." Officials and members of the board of directors and presidents of legal entities in charge of government offices subject to this law who violate this law shall be deemed to have seriously violated service regulations. The law stipulates the dissolution of the board of directors of the legal entity, and each director is prohibited from being re-elected for three years.</p>
<p>Belgium, in order to uphold the price of the franc, established "Belgian Franc Day." The slogan of the Franc Support League states, "Your motherland is Belgium. You must prosper with your motherland and perish with your motherland. You must economize, do not waste, and must love and use national products."</p>
<p>Switzerland established the Swiss Week Association and the Jewelry Sample City Association. Government offices strive to promote the use of national products.</p>
<p>Denmark designates every Friday as Danish Day, striving to promote the use of national products and affixing foreign product identification labels to thoroughfares.</p>
<p>Poland has set up mobile national product exhibition offices, organized national product incentive associations, and also has organizations such as the Polish Industrial Protection Association and the Industrial Assistance Association, which are dedicated to promoting the love and use of national products.</p>
<p>Norway encourages government offices to use national products and prohibits the posting of foreign product advertisements in public places.</p>
<p>Turkey's capital, Ankara, has established the headquarters of the Thrift and Savings Association, which is promoting the love and use of national products.</p>
<p>In addition, Japan, South American countries, Canada, the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, Australia, and other countries are also making efforts to promote the love and use of national products.</p>
<h3 id="e60">The German Unemployment Problem is Severe <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Metalworkers' Strike Deadlocked</p>
<p>Government Mediation Ineffective</p>
<p>A Berlin dispatch on the 23rd reports that the German economic situation is becoming increasingly serious. In the first two weeks of this month, the number of unemployed people increased by another 100,000, more than double the increase of only 46,000 in the previous two weeks. The total number of unemployed has now reached 3,184,000, of which only 1,980,000 are able to receive relief funds, while the rest have no income. Moreover, this phenomenon does not seem to be something that can be contained in a short period of time. Furthermore, the government's vigorous implementation of a salary reduction policy has reduced people's purchasing power, and there are fears that the situation will continue to deteriorate. It is unknown what kind of situation will develop this winter. As for the metalworkers on strike, there are still 132,000 people. After Chancellor Brüning consulted with the employers, he will consult with the workers' representatives today to discuss mediation methods. The arbitration committee will reconvene today, but the workers' attitude is tough, claiming that the salary reduction will greatly reduce their living standards, so they cannot accept it under any circumstances. Left-wing parties have jointly formed feeding stations to provide relief to the families of strikers. However, so far the workers have been able to strictly maintain order and not be used by the Communists as a tool for political struggle.</p>
<p>A Berlin dispatch on the 24th reports that the metalworkers' strike has become more intense. The mediation and negotiation led by the Ministry of Labor has yielded no results. Both capitalists and the Commercial Federation firmly refuse to yield. The capitalists insist that the official arbitrator's assessment of an 8% wage reduction is a fair and reasonable compromise to maintain productivity and cannot be conceded. The Commercial Federation claims that the current wages are already at the lowest rate, and any further reduction will make it impossible for workers to survive. Newspapers are expressing concern about this matter, fearing that once it spreads, it will be out of control, and advocating that the government find a way to reverse this tide.</p>

<p>Pacific on the 23rd, Geneva: In 1927, Persia and Afghanistan concluded a Treaty of Friendship and Security. The Persian government has now submitted it to the secretariat of the League of Nations for registration and publication. Its contents involve resolving disputes through peaceful means. If various disputes cannot be resolved through diplomatic means, each contracting state shall select a politician and entrust them to handle the matter jointly. If their opinions cannot be unified, the contracting states shall select a politician from a third country and request their ruling. The term of validity of the treaty is set at six years, but it may be extended.</p>

<p>No Change in the Revolutionary Army Front</p>
<p>A Berlin dispatch on the 23rd reports that banks in Brazil that had suspended operations due to the revolution have now resumed operations. Although the United States has issued a ban on the shipment of military supplies to Brazil, there are no restrictions on the weapons and ammunition purchased by the Brazilian government. The US government has ordered private aircraft manufacturers to postpone national orders so that they can produce four military aircraft per week for delivery to the Brazilian government. This demonstrates the United States' intentions towards Brazil.</p>
<p>Pacific on the 23rd, Josekyong, Japan: According to official sources, the revolutionary party attempted to break through the government army front on the border between the provinces of São Paulo and Paraná, but failed.

<p>A Madrid dispatch on the 23rd reports that the Spanish cabinet has decided to postpone the general election from December to early February of next year due to insufficient preparation.

<p>Abolishing the Laying of Wreaths at War Memorials</p>
<p>Reuters on the 24th, London: As Armistice Day approaches, the British Foreign Office has suggested to foreign governments that the practice of laying wreaths at war memorials and tombs of unknown soldiers during official visits to the capitals of various countries should be abolished, in order to eliminate the memory of the Great War. Feelings among Londoners are mixed about this suggestion, but it is generally recognized that the act of laying wreaths at war memorials is sometimes seen as a way to attract advertising.</p>

<p>Arabs Consider it a Great Victory</p>
<p>Reuters on the 24th, Jerusalem: The Falastin newspaper, run by Arabs here, calls the British government's declaration on Palestine policy a great victory for the Arabs, saying that Balfour's declaration is now a thing of the past, and Jews will no longer flock to Palestine or purchase land. The newspaper also urges Arabs to cooperate (roughly with the British government) to achieve independence.</p>
<p>Pacific on the 23rd, London: After the Palestinian policy aroused the dissatisfaction of Jews all over the world, the British government explained that the declaration issued by Balfour was considered a promise to the Jews to freely establish a settlement, and that it only gave the Jews the convenience of settling in the Holy Land, which was obviously a misunderstanding. The British government has recently issued a declaration intended to clarify the facts in order to reassure the Arabs and let them know that all [their property] will not be seized.</p>

<p>British Imperial Conference Discusses Overseas Immigration Matters</p>
<p>Reuters on the 22nd, London: British Prime Minister MacDonald is currently taking advantage of the fact that the representatives of the Imperial Conference have returned to their respective autonomous territories before the next meeting to hold talks to discuss the work of the conference. The committee meeting today discussed overseas immigration matters. It is reported that the number of British overseas citizens subsidized under the Imperial Immigration Act was 48,000 in 1920 and 72,000 in 1929, of which 37,000 overseas citizens immigrated to Canada with a subsidy of ten pounds. In 1928, the number of British people who emigrated to various places was 10,900, and in 1929 it was 10,700. In the first half of this year, 21,983 people went to Canada, including 1,900 who received subsidies. Of these 1,900 people, 1,400 received a ten-pound subsidy to go to Canada. In addition, a total of 4,228 people immigrated to Australia, including 1,506 who received national subsidies, and a total of 1,505 people immigrated to New Zealand, including 585 who received national subsidies.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 24th: The success of the British Imperial Conference may still be in doubt. According to today's important commentary in the Labour Party newspaper Daily News, it is strongly advocated that Great Britain should not arbitrarily make claims about the financial policies of its affiliated countries, and that the affiliated countries should certainly not stipulate Great Britain's financial policies. It is intended that this argument has foreshadowed the British government's rejection of the new system of royal rules.</p>

<p>National Provincial Bank Wins Lawsuit</p>
<p>Reuters on the 23rd, London: An Englishman, Holland, sued the National Provincial Bank, claiming that the bank hired him to smuggle arms from Northern Ireland to China for a client, but has now failed to fulfill the employment contract, so he is demanding compensation for losses or remuneration. The assistant manager of the National Provincial Bank's Cardiff branch testified that there was no employment contract. In February 1928, the bank received a remittance letter from a Chinese bank for over 92,000 pounds, instructing it to pay this amount to a company in Cardiff against the shipping documents for 10,000 rifles and 10 million rounds of ammunition. The bank had no other connection with the matter other than receiving this letter. In March of the same year, the bank replied to the Chinese bank, informing it that what it needed was not within the scope of the bank's business, so the remittance letter had to be returned. The jury believed that Holland had failed to prove the existence of the employment contract, so the court ruled that the National Provincial Bank had won the lawsuit. Questions were raised in the Northern Ireland House of Commons about this arms issue. The Northern Ireland Home Secretary replied that the claim that someone had purchased arms in Belfast to be sent to China was false. Before considering the proposal to purchase surplus arms held by the police and constabulary, a very detailed investigation was conducted. The disposal of all surplus arms was carried out in accordance with very strict regulations, so the arms deal mentioned in the court case did not occur and could not have occurred.</p>

<p>He Chengjun, Lu Dipin, and He Jian Will All Attend</p>
<p>A Hankou dispatch reports that the pacification conference of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi was previously convened by He Yingqin, the director of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters. All plans for bandit suppression, joint defense methods, troop deployments, and fundraising have been discussed and implemented. At that time, the communist bandits led by Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, and others were still in Hunan Province, and the military situation at the front was intense. Only the original troops were stationed in various places to encircle and suppress them. After more than a month, they were not completely wiped out. Now that the military situation at the front has ended, He Chengjun, the commander-in-chief of the Third Army Group, has been ordered to return to Hubei and concurrently serve as the director of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, presiding over pacification affairs in the three provinces. At the same time, the troops at the front, such as Xia Douyin's 13th Division, Chen Cheng's 11th Division, Xu Yuanquan's 48th Division, Xiao Zhichu's 44th Division, Jiang Guangnai's 60th Division, Cai Tingkai's 61st Division, and Rong Jingfang's Garrison Brigade, have all been ordered to return to Hankou to undertake pacification in the three provinces. With strong military strength, the situation is no longer the same as before. He Chengjun believes that it is necessary to convene another pacification conference, so he sent telegrams to Lu Dipin, the chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and He Jian, the chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, asking them to come to Hankou immediately for further discussions. Lu arrived in Hankou by plane from Nanjing on the 21st. On the 22nd, the Garrison Headquarters specially dispatched the Kessel plane to Hunan to welcome He Jian. He arrived on the 23rd by plane. A talk was held at noon, chaired by He Chengjun. Lu Dipin and He Jian immediately reported on the recent bandit situation in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. The methods of encirclement and suppression and the garrison locations of the victorious troops were generally decided. In the afternoon, He Chengjun hosted a banquet. Lu Dipin, because the bandit disaster in Jiangxi Province was more severe, returned to Nanchang by plane that afternoon. He Jian stayed at the Fourth Route Army's office in Hankou and was scheduled to return to Hunan on the 24th. It is heard that He Chengjun plans to go to Nanjing with Zhang Guanshi, the director of the Hubei Department of Finance, in early November to personally report everything to Chairman Jiang. (October 23rd)</p>

<p>A Hankou dispatch reports that He Jian, the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army and the chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, came to Hankou at the invitation of He Chengjun to attend the pacification conference of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and sent the Kessel plane to welcome him. He arrived at 8:00 AM on the 23rd and arrived at 10:00 AM. Those who came to the scene to welcome him included Wen Susong, a senior staff officer of the Garrison Headquarters, Bin Zhenyuan, the deputy adjutant of the Third Army Group Headquarters, Liu Wendao, the mayor of Hankou, Yang Duo, the representative of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, Li Shiyang, the director of the Hunan-Hubei Railway Bureau, and Hu Xie, the director of the Fourth Route Army's office in Hankou. After He got off the plane, he took a car to the Third Army Group Headquarters to meet with He Chengjun, report on the recent bandit suppression and administrative situation in Hunan Province, and participate in the talk at the pacification conference of the three provinces. He stayed at the Fourth Route Army's office in Hankou that evening. I visited him and He said the following: "After the bandit troops led by Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, and others failed to invade Changsha, they fled to Lianhua, Paizai, Ji'an, and Jishui in Jiangxi Province. The Fourth Route Army and the Luo Ling and Gong Bingfan divisions under the central government are simultaneously wiping out the remaining bandits near Changsha and pursuing them into Jiangxi. There are now no traces of bandits near Changsha, and the provincial government is carrying out land clearing work. Pingliu and other places, which were occupied by bandits for the longest time and suffered the most devastation, have been specially ordered to be stationed there by Tao Guang's division to be responsible for wiping out the scattered bandits. The troops entering Jiangxi, in addition to Gong Bingfan's division, which has been transferred from Hubei to Jiangxi, the remaining 77th Division of Luo Ling and the 19th Division of Li Jue are all chasing after them. Luo's division has reached Yuanzhou, and Li's division has reached Pingli. They will meet with the Jiangxi provincial army at a specified time to encircle and suppress the bandits. I have come here at the invitation of Deputy Director He to attend the pacification conference of the three provinces and report on the bandit situation in Hunan Province. I will have to return to Hunan tomorrow. The anti-rebel troops are returning victoriously one after another. Jiang and Cai's divisions have taken over the defense of southern Hubei to maintain traffic on the Wuhan-Changsha Road. The remaining troops will be stationed in the three provinces to suppress the bandits. In the shortest possible time, the bandit gangs can be completely wiped out. (October 23rd)</p>

<p>Song Runtian's Troops Transferred to Anqing</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: After the conclusion of military operations, the various units were demobilized and transferred to different defenses. Ye Kaixin's 52nd Division was ordered to gather in Xuzhou for training and take responsibility for the defense of Xuzhou. Song Runtian's Xuzhou Garrison Command, originally the 169th Brigade of Yue Shengxuan's 57th Division, was ordered to be transferred to Anqing. It is reported that the 52nd Division troops have been arriving in Xuzhou from Zhengzhou in succession since the 17th. The troops left behind in Haozhou are still waiting to depart. The division consists of two brigades and two supplementary regiments. Deputy Division Commander Han Deqin led Zhang Zhongfu's 154th Brigade, the 123rd Regiment, and Sun Changjun's 155th Brigade, the 5th Regiment, and departed from Haozhou for combat. Ye Kaixin remained in Haozhou, and defended Haozhou with the 4th and 6th Regiments. Currently, Deputy Division Commander Han arrived in Xuzhou from Zhengzhou on the 19th. Various departments of the division headquarters arrived one after another and were stationed at the old site of the Xuzhou Headquarters. Since the 20th, Han's troops have taken over the defense of Xuzhou. When the reporter visited Mr. Han yesterday afternoon, he said that his troops had fought from Haozhou, passing through between Pixian and Suixian, to reach Chenliu, along the south of the Longhai Line to Zhongmou, copied to the north of the Longhai Line, and advanced to Zhengzhou. After the war ended, they were ordered to be stationed in Xuzhou for training. Division Commander Ye was the commander of the 8th Army during the war and is currently stationed in Haozhou, and will also lead the troops in Haozhou to Xuzhou.

<p>The Process of Recapturing Luoyang</p>
<p>The Current Status of Transportation on All Routes</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: After inspecting Zhengzhou for two days, the Xuzhou reporters planned to go to Luoyang, but were prevented by rain. However, they learned about the recent situation in western Luoyang in Zhengzhou, and continued to inspect the trenches in Zhengzhou. They left Zhengzhou at noon on the 18th and returned to Xuzhou. The sequel is as follows:</p>
<p>Luoyang Situation: Luoyang is 240 li west of Zhengzhou. Feng's army has a garrison commander stationed in Luoyang. Yang Hucheng's troops occupied Luoyang Station on the 10th. Garrison Commander Zhao Shouyu still guarded the city and closed the city for several days. Yang's troops and Xu Yuanquan's troops jointly surrounded it. Yang's forward troops had already passed through Luoyang and advanced westward. The Zhengzhou-west ticket train reached Luoyang East Station directly on the 14th. Zhao Shouyu's troops in the city, hearing the sound of the train whistle at the station, fired at the station. Finally, with no way to retreat, they negotiated surrender. The city gate was opened on the 16th. Xu Yuanquan is handling the aftermath in Luoyang, and will disarm and reorganize Zhao's troops. Yang Hucheng himself is also stationed at Luoyang Station, commanding his troops to advance westward. As of when the reporter left Zhengzhou, the ticket train could already reach Jinguyuan, the west station of Luoyang, but most of them were damaged factory cars. In addition, Luoyang City has just been captured, the disarmament has not been completed, and peace has not yet been fully achieved.</p>
<p>Military News from Western Luoyang: Feng's troops, including Song Zheyuan and Ge Yunlong's troops, retreated from western Luoyang. There was no resistance along the way, so there were no fierce battles. Song's troops initially went west along the railway line, and Yang Hucheng's troops pursued from behind. On the 17th, military news from western Luoyang was obtained, and Song's troops crossed the Yellow River north after passing through Shanzhou, heading towards Fenglingdu. Therefore, since the 17th, the telephone line on the Longhai Road has been connected to Tongguan. Yang Hucheng's pursuit troops, considering Tongguan's importance and the fact that Song's troops had already crossed the river, sent teams to defend the south bank of the Yellow River on the one hand, and continued to advance rapidly towards Tongguan on the other. Military news on the 18th stated that the forward troops had passed Hangu and reached Lingbao, and would arrive in Tongguan within a day. Military transport vehicles can already travel westward across Shanzhou. The Transportation Command has appointed Zhang Jiechao as the director of the Luoyang Office and Xu Lanting as the director of the Shanzhou Office. Zhang went west to Luoyang on the 15th, and Xu went west to Tongguan on the 18th, and established offices separately to handle military transportation at the front. As of the 18th, there were no Feng's troops east of Tongguan.</p>
<p>Zheng Suburb Battle Trenches: Before leaving Zhengzhou on the 18th, the reporter went to inspect the gathering point battle trenches of Feng's army three li east of Zheng Station. These trenches were built by Feng's army one month before retreating from Zhengzhou. Initially, Feng's army did not build defensive fortifications in Zhengzhou. After the successive defeats on the Longping lines at the front, they temporarily dug them to specifically protect Zhengzhou City Station. This type of battle trench is built in a special way, all around the village. A circular ditch is dug around the village, with a depth and width of about four to five feet. Behind the ditch is a small bunker, about three feet above the ground. On top of the bunker, there are concealing earth blocks, arranged on the bunker like sawtooths. The houses and trees in the village are used as natural concealment. Each village has the same effort. Between the village and the ditch, there are oblique and winding traffic trenches to connect them, which can be used for people to walk. Because the ditches are clustered around the village as densely as stars, the soldiers call them gathering point ditches. The construction of these ditches employed 10,000 civilians and took about two weeks.</p>
<p>Transportation Overview: The four roads of Zhengbu are open, and the Pinghan southbound ticket train is unobstructed. The northbound ticket train can already reach Rongze, and military vehicles can directly reach the south bank of the Yellow River. There is a small damage to the Yellow River Railway Bridge. The damage is at the southern end and has been repaired. Along the Longhai Road, willow trees are seen replacing sleepers along the way. The train travels very slowly, and the ticket trains are extremely crowded. The reporters left Zhengzhou at 3:30 pm on the 18th and arrived in Xuzhou at 12:00 pm on the 19th. The train cars were dark at night. They borrowed a horse lamp from the train guard to guard their luggage. Along the way, there was wind and rain, and the cold wind penetrated the empty windows without boards, making people want to stay silent. The rainfall along the way was sufficient. The drought in the sandy land of Henan Province was alleviated by this rain, which should benefit agriculture a lot. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Shandong Provincial Government Prepares to Redeem the Jiaoji Railway <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Li Dufang, a standing committee member of the Economic and Financial Reorganization Committee of the Shandong Provincial Government, proposed to the Provincial Government to establish a Preparatory Committee for Redeeming the Jiaoji Railway to prepare for the redemption of the Jiaoji Railway. This proposal was passed by the standing committee of the committee today (22nd). It is heard that Han Fuqu, chairman of the provincial government, also strongly agrees with this matter. This case will be submitted for discussion at the provincial government standing committee this Friday (24th). The original case is recorded as follows: "For the proposal to prepare for the redemption of the Jiaoji Railway to develop Shandong's economy and finance, it is found that the Jiaoji Railway was decided by the Beijing government to be returned to China by the Japanese. Later, after negotiations between the Shandong Case Aftermath Committee and the Japanese envoy, it was valued at 40 million Japanese yen, and after receiving it, interest was paid for seven years, and the principal was repaid in eight years, to be redeemed in fifteen years. Counting from February 1, 1923, when it was formally received, the interest payment period expired on February 1 of this year, and the method of redemption should have been planned long ago. However, since the reception, wars have been frequent, and the political situation has changed repeatedly, and there has been no time to discuss redemption. In addition, at that time, the road had a board of directors that seized power and held it, abused private individuals, and shared the benefits. It is estimated that the annual income of the road over the years was more than 12 million yuan, of which more than 9 million yuan was used for interest on debt notes, salaries of employees, and regular bureau expenses, and more than 2 million yuan was used for purchasing materials. The annual surplus was only several hundred thousand yuan. The huge waste was unprecedented in the country. The board of directors was not happy to discuss redemption, and the central government and the Shandong government had no time to discuss redemption, allowing such a large property to be held by foreigners, which is very regrettable. It is found that the Jiaoji Railway line is more than 900 li long, running across the east and west, all in Shandong Province. It connects Qingdao, the tail of Asia, in the east, and Jinan, the capital of the province, in the west. It borrows Jinpu to the south and has the south goods of Longhai. It connects Cangshi to the north and gathers the transportation of Yan and Jin, all of which are exported to Qingdao through this road. It is truly the general hub of the economy and finance of Qi and Lu, and the lifeline of 37 million people. Moreover, when the road rights are in the hands of foreigners, they hold the interests of Shandong and control the fate of China. For example, the troops entered in May 3rd, causing strange changes at home and abroad, secretly assisting warlords, resulting in the remnants of Jiaodong, and privately transporting military fire and extensively selling drugs, manipulating bandits, and ravaging the interior. The economy of the people of the province is being destroyed and exploited day by day. How can it not be the case that the road rights are in the hands of foreigners? If we do not quickly redeem them, the people of Lu will never have peace, and the economy and finance of this province will not be able to develop. In the past, at the beginning of the reception of Jiaozhou, some people proposed that this road should be owned by the people, and the government also clearly ordered Gu Zhongxiu to be the supervisor of road redemption. Internal and external agencies and staff also deducted salaries as road redemption funds. However, it ended up failing. The only achievement was that the Jiaoji Road spent several more yuan to pay the salary of the supervisor, and the salary deducted by the staff also flowed to the reimbursement of the agency. As for the past governors and warlords of the province, they only cared about abusing the people to their heart's content. The previous provincial government could have done something at the time of the revolutionary unification, but it did not have time for this, nor could it mention this. Now, fortunately, our chairman is ordered to govern Lu, and he is greatly refreshing, consolidating the military and economy, working hard to govern, and looking forward to starting anew with the people of Lu. It is also the day of success in the anti-rebellion, and the Jiaoji Road should be redeemed. This is truly the only good fortune for Shandong, and it is also the only important task for our chairman to save Lu and save the people. If our chairman resolutely decides to prepare the foundation for road redemption, gradually formulate funds, lead the people, redeem it as scheduled, and do not hesitate to restore national sovereignty once, the people of Lu will be blessed for generations, and it will also be the glory of the whole country and the immortal great achievement that will shock the world. However, this matter is of great importance, and the investigation should be detailed, the consideration should be meticulous, and the planning should be careful. It cannot be hastily or recklessly planned, nor can it be fully explained in a few words. To summarize it, the main points can be roughly stated, such as determining whether the road rights are owned by the province or the country, abolishing the board of directors of the road, reorganizing the road administration income, formulating road redemption funds, and organizing a fund management committee. There are many items, which cannot be enumerated. At the beginning of the launch, the most important thing is to submit a request to the provincial government by this committee, submit it for discussion, and establish a road redemption preparatory committee. However, at the beginning of the preparation, do not expand the matter. It seems that it can be attached to this committee, the expenses can be slightly increased, and the staff does not need to be added. First, the members of this committee will be the members of the road redemption preparation. Those who are good at road administration or familiar with the Jiaoji Road situation, which are necessary for the preparation, will be rehired. After the preparation is slightly rudimentary and gradually successful, submit a case to the central government and set up another agency to implement the road redemption. It is not too late. This is a humble opinion of a committee member to initiate the redemption of the road in order to establish the fundamental outline of Shandong's economy and finance. Is it appropriate? I beg for public decision. Proposer: Standing Committee Member Li Dufang."</p>
<h3 id="e79">Guangdong Province Resumes Cashing Central Bank Notes <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>First Cash the Ten-Yuan and Five-Yuan Notes Issued by Huang Longsheng</p>
<p>Announces Suspension of Accepting Uncashed Banknote Deposits and Paying Interest</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province's finances have recently improved as the local war has ended and several million yuan worth of financial treasury bonds have been sold over the past few months. The Central Bank's fund is becoming more and more abundant. Recently, the funds for recognized and sold bonds from various parties have been fully deposited in the Central Bank. The authorities also believe that the value of the uncashed five-yuan and ten-yuan notes on the market is increasing due to the treasury bond sales. Recently, it has risen to 94% or 95% of its face value, which is not much different from the full price. Therefore, at the regular provincial affairs meeting on the 17th, a talk was held (because Chen Mingshu, Lin Yunxi, Sun Xiwen, Deng Yanhua, etc. have gone north and the quorum is not met), and the proposal to restore uncashed banknotes was raised. After a long discussion, it was decided to first unconditionally cash the five-yuan and ten-yuan notes signed in English by Huang Longsheng (former president of the Central Bank) and Zhou Siming (former vice president). It was decided to implement it on the 20th of this month, and the rest will be cashed successively at the beginning of next month. After receiving the order, the Central Bank has actively prepared. It is found that there are only 3 million Central Bank notes circulating outside. The bank has prepared considerable cash, and it will be easy to cope with it. As for the Beihai and Meilu branches in the South Road, the head office also telegraphed them to resume business immediately. Huang Shiguang, the head of the Beihai branch, and his staff have transported the cash of the branch by the warship Hairui. As for Huang Yufang, the head of the Meilu branch, he escorted the cash to Meilu on the 17th. Once he arrives, he can resume business. As the uncashed banknotes on the market have been scheduled to be cashed, the Central Bank announced on the 16th that it would stop accepting uncashed banknote deposits and pay interest to end the previous absorption method. The bank has issued the following notice: "It is found that this bank has submitted a request to the Guangdong Provincial Government for approval to accept uncashed banknotes, and to fix the term and pay interest on deposits. The starting period is from August 1st of this year to the end of October. It has been notified to the public. Now it is found that the period is about to expire, and the market needs more and more various banknotes of this bank. There are very few merchants and people who come to the bank to deposit. This deposit should be stopped from the 16th of this month, and the interest on the demand deposit that has not been withdrawn will also be stopped from this day to end it. As for the time deposit, interest will still be calculated until the full three months. In addition to reporting, this is a special notice." (October 18th)</p>
<p>Guangzhou Continued News: The Central Bank opened to cash five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes yesterday (20th). First, the acting president Fan Qiwu was ordered by the provincial government to open the five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes with English signatures of Huang Longsheng and Zhou Siming on the 20th. Since the 19th was a Sunday holiday, he ordered the staff on the 18th to prepare all the matters for the opening of the exchange to avoid temporary troubles. At the same time, the business section was ordered to allocate the prepared funds to the head office, the Xidi branch, and the Yonghan exchange office to prepare for citizens to come to cash. At 9:00 am yesterday morning, the Central Head Office, the Xidi Branch, and the Yonghan Office started cashing at the same time. At about 8:00, the president and vice president Fan Qiwu and Shen Zaihe arrived at the head office by car to direct the handling of everything. It was found that the cashing method on that day was in accordance with the provincial government's order. Only the five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes with English signatures of Huang Longsheng and Zhou Siming were cashed. The rest of the five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes with Chinese signatures were not exchanged. Therefore, those who did not understand the procedure and held the above-mentioned Chinese banknotes to cash were politely explained by the staff, and they were asked to wait for the order to open the exchange before bringing them to cash again. On that day, the cashing order was extremely small due to the few people who came to cash, and there were special police officers protecting and maintaining it in front of the door, so there was no disorder. As for the Xidi Branch and the Yonghan Exchange, after receiving the funds allocated by the head office, they also started cashing five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes at the same time. The number of people who came to cash was even smaller. According to statistics, the head office cashed only more than 10,000 yuan in the morning, and only about 30,000 yuan in the afternoon. The total amount cashed by the Xidi Branch and the Yonghan Exchange was about 50,000 yuan for the whole day. According to the investigation of the Central Bank, the total amount of this banknote circulating on the market is about 3 million yuan, of which more than 1 million yuan are five-yuan notes and more than 1 million yuan are ten-yuan notes. The total fund owned by Zhonghe is more than 10 million yuan. In addition to the cashing reserve for one-yuan and one-hundred-yuan banknotes accounting for more than 6 million yuan, the rest is enough to cope with the cashing of five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes with English signatures and there is a surplus. The general merchants and people therefore have this banknote, which is fully circulated on the market, and the Central Bank has sufficient funds and stable credit, so most of them do not go to cash it to save procedures. Most of those who come to cash are partners of various silver houses, all of whom are cashing small amounts of two or three hundred yuan. (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e80">A Terrible Fire in Wuzhou <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>A fire broke out on a raft in the Fuyi River in Wuzhou on the afternoon of the 17th, killing and injuring dozens of men and women, and causing property losses of more than 300,000 yuan. At about 3:30 pm, near the Jinling Restaurant staircase, a stove was set up close to the wooden walls of the house. The partners placed too much firewood, causing the wooden walls to catch fire. The fire spread quickly. The facade and staircase of the Jinling Restaurant were first ignited, and then spread to the large and small boats parked near the raft. The fire became more intense and spread to the Lingnan Restaurant, Xinfa, Fu'anfa, Tianhefa, Anxingfa, etc. All nearby flower boats were burned. The bamboo and wooden houses on the riverbank from the iron pillar pier to the Shixiang mouth were also affected. The windows and doors of the Guangtaiyu and Liang stores on Jiufang Road were also ignited, but fortunately, the rescue was effective and it did not spread. Otherwise, the stores along Jiufang Road would have been unimaginable. When the fire spread, the nearby rafts could not escape, and the wooden rafts and boats that were farther away drove out of the river to avoid the fire. Two rafts, Yongcheng and others, hired fire boats and towed them to the river surface of the iron pillar pier. The rest of the large and small boats also rushed to open, or drove to the Huoshan River to park. The river surface from the Fuyi River mouth to Helongzhou was full of large and small boats and wooden rafts, flowing down with the water, rushing to escape. The situation was extremely panicked. The prostitutes Nantongmei and the boat girls of the raft rushed ashore, in a state of disarray. The fire alarm tower of the fire brigade in Dongmen immediately rang the bell to warn, and all water carts and water dragons arrived to put out the fire. The fire engines of the fire brigade of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the two fire boats of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce drove to the center of the Fuyi River, spraying water towards the fire on the rafts. The water carts of the Chengxiang Fire Service Branch, the Xinglongfang water carts, and the Wutongfang water carts were stationed at Wuxian Pier, Tiezhuzi Pier, and Shixiang Mouth to put out the fire. At 4:50, the fire gradually slowed down, and the stores along Jiufang Road were able to be preserved. At 5:30, the fire was completely extinguished. The fire brigade of the Municipal Public Security Bureau still watered the remaining embers one by one to avoid re-ignition. The Sixth Third Division Supplementary Regiment of the Headquarters, the Security Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the police stations in various districts all sent teams to suppress the situation at Jiufang Road, Tiezhuzi Pier, Wuxian Pier, and Shixiang Mouth. The headquarters also sent Browning pistol teams and military police to the west gate to strictly guard against accidents. The Water Police Department also used ships to carry armed police to patrol the river. Therefore, the order at that time was extremely peaceful. The teams did not return to their units until 6:00. Although the deaths and injuries caused by this fire could not be accurately investigated for a while, they were generally more than 30 or 40 people. Most of them were killed by drowning. Seven wooden rafts and dozens of flower boats and other large and small boats were burned. All the flower wine wooden rafts and boats were burned. A total of more than 40 bamboo and wooden houses on the riverbank were burned. The total loss was no less than 300,000 yuan, which is a rare disaster in recent years.</p>

<p>Negotiations After the Closure of the Silk Weaving Factory: The Wuxi Silk Weaving Factory in Mianhua Lane outside the Ximen Gate of this county was opened by eight people including Rong Jianming and Li Yuren with a total share of 8,200 yuan, and a distribution office was set up at the Shuyuan Lane entrance in the city. However, due to the poor quality of the factory's products and sluggish sales, all the above-mentioned shares were completely lost. Shareholder Li Yuren became ill due to anxiety and passed away. Subsequently, after a meeting of shareholders, a solution was maintained. It was decided that Li's wife, Ms. Yang, would borrow 1,000 yuan from a certain money house, and certain shareholders would guarantee 4,000 yuan, so that the goods could continue to be shipped. Recently, the factory was unable to turn around and announced its closure. Ms. Li Yang's垫欵, with 20 pieces of woven silk as 800 yuan, and 200 yuan of capital, and 120 yuan of interest, was guaranteed by the manager Rong Jianming, and returned in full after the distribution office was sold. Yesterday, the lady learned that the distribution office had been sold and received 490 yuan. She immediately demanded payment from Rong Jianming, but Rong shirked in every possible way and did not fulfill the previous agreement. He was immediately arrested by the first branch of the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Inspector Qin opened a preliminary trial, and the testimonies of both parties were different. He ordered the prisoner to be escorted to the General Administration for transfer to the county government for review. Another Dispute Arises in Ruifeng Silk Factory: The three silk factories of Xiyi Defeng, Ruichang, and Qianfeng have recently experienced strikes one after another. Fortunately, the mediation was appropriate, and nothing happened. However, a dispute suddenly broke out in Ruifeng Silk Factory under Yinglong Bridge outside the West Gate. The reason was that the factory's assistant managers Wang Huitang and Wang Jiqing suddenly announced the suspension of work yesterday, intending to rely on two days of bonus work (according to the labor-capital agreement, two days of bonus work is relied on for every ten days of work). They claimed that raw materials would not be received until November 2nd. The workers were extremely angry when they heard the news. After the county party rectification committee and the people's training committee received the news, they sent Lu Zhenwen to mediate. Lu 君 consulted with the female workers' heads and Wang Huitang and Wang Jiqing, and they agreed to start the car on the 28th of this month. If it is not implemented, the bonus work must also be paid. The female workers thought that verbal agreement was not enough, and asked the labor and capital to sign an agreement to keep the letter. However, Tu Huitang and others insisted on not agreeing. The female workers were very angry and started yelling. After Lu Zhenwen persuaded them again and again, Wang Huitang sent the chief Che Shiqing to sign the agreement as a representative first. The female workers were satisfied and dispersed.</p>
<p>Suspected Thieves Escorted to the County for Investigation: The detective team of the Public Security Bureau of Xiyi County captured eight suspected thieves, including Gu Yanjiang, outside the West Gate the day before yesterday. It is reported that yesterday afternoon, the Public Security Bureau prepared documents to escort them to the county together. After being tried by trial officer Yu in court, except for Gu Yanjiang, who stuttered in his confession and was slightly suspicious, he ordered the temporary detention of the others. The other seven people, including Zhao Rongxi and Ma Da, were all innocent, and the reporter Zhao Xingpei could not point out the facts of the case, or there was a suspicion of framing with a grudge, so he ordered them to be released on bail together and await summons for verification and investigation.</p>

<p>Petition to Increase Prison Capacity: The original prisoner quota for Zhenjiang County Prison was 130, but there are currently over 300 male and female convicts who have been sentenced. In addition, the Jiangsu Provincial Security Department has sent over 120 prisoners for detention. There are only 20 large and small prison cells, housing over 400 prisoners, which is extremely crowded and difficult to accommodate more. Meanwhile, the number of convicts sentenced by the local court for execution and prisoners sent by the Security Department for detention continues to increase. It is rumored that the County Government plans to build additional prison cells in the open space in front of the prison and has petitioned the High Court and the Security Department to allocate funds for construction.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Government Sets Deadline for Completion of Zhongzheng Road: Construction on Zhongzheng Road in the Jiangsu Provincial capital began half a year ago. Recently, it has been reported that the Provincial Government is concerned about the slow progress, which is hindering traffic, and has ordered the Provincial Capital Construction Engineering Office to complete the project by November without further delay. It is reported that Tang Ying, the director of the Provincial Capital Construction Engineering Office, has instructed his subordinates to step up supervision of the work to ensure its completion on schedule. Furthermore, the section of road from the end of the main road to the New West Gate has many curves due to the presence of houses. This has resulted in frequent collisions and injuries to pedestrians. In view of this, the Construction Engineering Office is currently planning to demolish the houses in the curved sections and convert the road into a straight one. The houses on both sides of the narrow sections have also been marked for demolition to facilitate traffic.</p>
<p>Arrest of Muyang Counter-Revolutionary Fugitive in Xian: Wang Fuzhi, a fugitive counter-revolutionary from Muyang, was previously prosecuted by the County Party Committee for supporting the corrupt former County Magistrate Dong Shenghan in leading a crowd to destroy the Third Branch of the Xiguan District. He was sentenced to imprisonment by the County Government. Fearing the law, Wang fled and secretly came to Zhenjiang, staying at Jiang Yulong Inn by the river. He secretly associated with Song Huiting, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce who had previously aided the rebels in the province by extorting donations, with the intention of engaging in other activities. Recently, the Public Security Bureau detected this and arrested him yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM. He is currently detained in the bureau, and it is said that he will be escorted back to Muyang for prosecution as soon as the request for his extradition arrives.</p>
<p>Agricultural Department Explains Use of Agricultural Bank Funds: The Jiangsu Province farmers’ bank funds collected from each county were originally converted from the two-cent per mu donation during the Sun Chuanfang era. In the northern Jiangsu counties, because the rebel army was in the area, funds were urgently needed, and most of the collection was carried out in the 15th and 16th years of the Republic. Moreover, because separate receipts were printed, the collection was not included in the Ding Pu levy, resulting in lower receipts than the Ding Pu levy and a significant shortfall. People misunderstood that this fund would also be canceled because taxes before the 15th year had been exempted, making collection difficult. Yesterday, the Agricultural Department issued a sincere notice to the 35 northern Jiangsu counties, stating that the Farmers’ Bank was established to support the development of the rural economy. Although the current funds collected were converted from the previous mu donation, their use is now implemented for agriculture, which is very different from the previous allocation for military needs. It urged everyone to actively contribute and not misunderstand.</p>

Currently, for loans to yarn factories, it can join the debt group to recover them in sequence. Salt reclamation debt tickets and loans for various reclamation lands are to be used to demarcate land for interest collection or sold for realization.</p>

<p>Bandit Gangster Arrested for Adultery: Zhu A Gen, a wanted criminal in the case of the robbery of Xincang Town, contracted syphilis from prostitution after getting the loot. He also had an affair with the wife of someone. Recently, he has been hiding at the home of a Zhang family in the enclosure. The wife's brother-in-law, taking advantage of his wealth, allowed him to hide without any restrictions. After a long time, he was discovered and arrested. He confessed to being a robber and looting without hesitation. He also claimed that he had a severe opium addiction and could not bear the torture, so he asked for a quick death sentence. This bandit can be said to be full of evil and has thrown himself into the net.</p>

<p>Preparing to Organize Audit Office: The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that many of its affiliated agencies, such as the Financial Review Committee, the Provincial Design Committee, the Provincial Final Accounts Committee, the Regulations Review Committee, and the Economic Committee, have similar functions and could be merged. It has now decided to first abolish the Financial Review Committee and the Final Accounts Committee, and merge all the original responsibilities of the two committees into a newly established Zhejiang Provincial Government Audit Office to manage them. It is currently actively preparing for this. As for the selection of the director of the Audit Office, there are rumors of Ma Yinchu, Jiang Yuanxin, and Wei Songtang.</p>

<p>Tenant Forced to Hang Himself: Yao Ruihe, the owner of Yaoyuantai Tinware Store on Yushi Tianning Temple Main Street, has been running his tinware store for over fifty years. The store is rented from Lin Yougen, with an annual rent of 40 yuan. Recently, a small vegetable market is being built near the Xiaojiaochang near the store. The landlord, Lin, thought he could make a profit and used this as an excuse to increase the rent fourfold, requiring a full year's rent of 160 yuan in advance. Yao Ruihe agreed to increase the rent by 60 yuan, but Lin still refused and forced him to leave the house. Yao Ruihe became depressed and hanged himself upstairs at around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. Yao's son, Yunhe, believes that his father's death was caused by the landlord's forcing him to raise the rent. He is very unwilling and has reportedly filed a lawsuit with the court yesterday.</p>
<p>Two Robbery Cases: At the home of Chen Da Wen in the Ancestral Hall Village of Simen Township, Yuyao, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived the night before last, wielding firearms and flashlights. They broke down the door and looted. The bandits, seeing that there were not many boxes, cages, or valuables, and unable to satisfy their desires, kidnapped Chen Dawen's two-year-old grandson. Chen's wife, seeing her grandson being taken away, pleaded with the bandit leader. As a result, she paid the bandits 800 yuan, and the bandits left the child. Furthermore, the Fucheng Nunnery in Baishudi, more than ten li outside of Wusheng Gate in the north of Yuyao City, is located in a remote area with no neighbors. Only an elderly woman named Yu lives in the nunnery. The night before last, five or six bandits suddenly arrived, seized the elderly woman, and demanded silver. As a result, the elderly woman had no silver to give. The bandits then robbed her cotton quilt, clothes, and over ten yuan in cash before leaving.</p>

<p>(3) School Affairs Meeting to Be Reorganized: Zhang Naiyan expressed great sympathy for the students' demands to reorganize the School Affairs Meeting with the principle of professors running the school and for the independent expenses of each college.

<p>Before the Promulgation of the Degree Awarding Law</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently presented a document to the Executive Yuan proposing that public and private universities should not be allowed to award honorary degrees without authorization before the Degree Awarding Law is enacted. The document stated that the establishment of degrees is for the purpose of honoring academics and encouraging future generations. The granting of degrees in European, American, and Japanese countries is extremely solemn, because titles cannot be given lightly. If they are abused slightly, they will damage their dignity. The Degree Awarding Law in our country is being carefully drafted by the Legislative Yuan. Before it is enacted and promulgated, it is proposed that public and private universities should not be allowed to award honorary degrees without authorization in order to emphasize the importance of titles and prevent abuse.</p>

<p>Chen Bulei, the Commissioner of Education for Zhejiang Province, repeatedly requested to resign from his post and personally went to the front lines to meet Chairman Chiang, but was persuaded to stay on both occasions. He has returned to his duties at the office. In a recent report during the weekly memorial service, he stated that he had twice resigned due to illness and weakness, but the Central Government repeatedly urged him to remain. Public servants should not simply leave when they wish, but should align their will with that of the Central Government. Since the Central Government has repeatedly urged him to withdraw his resignation, he will, from now on, exert himself in public service despite his illness.</p>

<p>In recent years, the Economic Society of China has been making rapid progress. In addition to the main society, branches have been established in major ports. The Hangzhou branch, since its establishment last year, has achieved considerable results. Its organization is quite simple, consisting of a president, vice-president, and secretary-cum-accountant, unlike the main society which has a board of directors. Both the president, Jin Runquan, and the vice-president, Jiang Zuomin, are very responsible and dedicated. The branch's expenses are raised independently, without relying on the main society. The branch's office has been temporarily borrowed from the Financial Personnel Training Institute, for which Vice-President Jiang Zuomin is responsible for the construction. The two Baoshan Western-style houses allocated by the provincial government earlier can only be moved into after the municipal government repairs the Baochu Pagoda. The members hold a monthly dinner, which is well attended. Members take turns hosting, and before the meal, a meeting is held to discuss matters or economic issues. All members are free to express their opinions.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Institute in Wuxi, for the purpose of trialing urban mass education implementation methods this year, has specifically established an experimental Mass Education Center at the South Gate of Wuxi.

It has become necessary to find ways to expand the school. Therefore, it is planned to collaborate with local individuals to open a specially contracted Mass School, with the aim of achieving widespread education. A brief proposal has been drafted to solicit enthusiastic comrades to actively participate in the establishment. It is reported that the school board of Gengdu Qiao Private Limin Elementary School and others have already expressed their support and will open the school soon.</p>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School and its affiliated elementary school were founded by Wu Huaijiu in the 26th year of the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, and have now been in existence for 29 years. Initially, it was a private school, then it was changed to a county school, and then in March of the 17th year of the Republic of China, it was changed to a municipal school of Shanghai. The school held a memorial meeting yesterday (the 24th). Xu Jinfu, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Guo Shihui, representative of the Mayor, Director Xu of the Education Bureau, and guests such as Ni Wenya, attended. At 9:00 AM, after the flag-raising ceremony, the memorial meeting was opened. After the ceremony was performed, Principal Wang Xiaoying reported on the brief history of the school and future new plans. Xu Yefu, representative of the Municipal Party Department, gave a speech, stating that your school is the oldest girls' school in Shanghai, and the significance of the anniversary is to celebrate the past and pray for the future. It is hoped that after 29 years, it will be more advanced than the 29th anniversary of the Wuben Girls' School (photo taken by this newspaper).</p>
<p>In the past nineteen years, there has been more progress, and in the future, it will be of great benefit to women's education in China. Guo Shihui, representative of the Mayor, gave a speech, stating that it is not easy for a school to have a history of 29 years. It is hoped that Principal Wang, all teachers and staff, and all students will continue to work hard so that the 30th anniversary next year will be even more successful. Director Xu of the Education Bureau gave a speech, stating that there are two points to pay attention to: (I) Wuben has a history of 29 years, and it is rare to have such a complete scale in Shanghai. You are fortunate to have the opportunity to study here, and it is hoped that you will pay close attention to your studies and discipline, so as not to disappoint your parents' expectations and the hard work of the municipal authorities in running the school. (II) The founder, Mr. Wu Huaijiu, was so enthusiastic about education two or three decades ago, which is admirable. Now the municipal education expenditure accounts for about a quarter of the total expenditure, and the municipal authorities have more desire to allocate funds to promote women's education, but in fact, it is no longer allowed. It is hoped that there will be more enthusiastic people like Mr. Wu, so that Wuben can be more complete. Then, Ni Wenya gave a speech, stating that it is rare to see Chinese schools with more than 30 years of history, especially girls' schools. Your school has been established for 29 years and is worth commemorating, and it is really worthy. Then, the alumni representative gave a reply, and finally, Principal Wang gave a thank-you speech and the meeting adjourned. From 2:00 PM onwards, there was a recreational performance to celebrate, which was very grand for a time.</p>

<p>Sends Letter to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council recently established an education department and began investigating the situation of various schools within the concession. It is reported that the Ningbo Shanghai Association convened a temporary meeting of the school board a few days ago and unanimously passed a circular to all schools established by the association, expressing their opposition. It is also reported that members of the association, Tong Youxiang and others, specifically sent a joint letter to the association authorities yesterday, forwarding it to Chairman Chiang of the National Government, and put forward four measures, requesting their adoption and implementation. The original letter reads: Chairman Qiaqing of the Ningbo Shanghai Association, Director Zhang Shenzhi, urgently forward to President Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government. According to reports, the eighth elementary school's physical education staff and faculty have sent a letter exposing the Municipal Council's establishment of an education department and the conspiracy to harm our education. It is even more evident that the imperialists' ambitions of aggression are endless. The imperialists are accustomed to cunning tricks, first luring people into their trap, and then heavily oppressing them, making them fall into a deep and fiery pit, unable to escape. This time, the Municipal Council's establishment of this kind of organization, its ambition lies in taking further measures to occupy the concession for a long time, not only to manipulate education within the concession. If we allow it to proceed, the concession will be subject to another layer of restriction. How can our late Premier's policy of taking back the concession and abolishing unequal treaties be realized? At the thought of this, I hate it so much. We Ningbo people, living in Shanghai, account for the largest number of residents in the city. Our association is also the only organization for Ningbo people living in Shanghai. We should unite with various public organizations and strive to fight for: (I) Please the government to lodge a serious protest and immediately abolish the pseudo-education department. (II) Warn the Chinese who are hired by the bureau to handle education to urge them to resign voluntarily. (III) The schools previously run by the Municipal Council should be immediately handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Government to take over. (IV) The Municipal Council should annually allocate a certain amount of education funding from the taxes collected in the concession, which should be used by the Shanghai Municipal Government to run education in the concession. According to the above-mentioned articles, actively carry out the above, so that our late Premier's policy can be realized. If they stubbornly refuse, we Chinese living in the concession should immediately stop paying taxes as a backing. This matter concerns the foundation of the country. I hope you will adopt and implement it. I cannot help but look forward to it.</p>

<p>At the China Baseball Field</p>
<p>Former teammates face off today</p>
<p>The Zhenru and Lehua football teams were originally old partners, but now they face off in the Foreigner's Football Association, adding a lot of color to the football world. The two teams will meet at 3:00 PM this afternoon at the China Baseball Field on Laoshenfu Road, which is one of the most important matches in today's Sino-Western competitions, and it is also the most colorful battle in this year's football tournament. Zhenru's lineup is even more solid than the last time they fought Huashi, and they have a great tendency to overcome Lehua, and Lehua's defender pillar, Li Ning, has returned to Shanghai a few days ago, which is equivalent to adding a new force to Lehua, but Zhang Xulong, the central defender who played in the last game against Huase Division, has left Shanghai to go to Singapore, so Lehua's central defense line is still not improving, and An Yuansheng will serve in an important position, and the forward line has not changed much, only Sun Xingdang of Guanghua will transfer Wang Jiwei to the right inside forward, and Yu Qiaosheng will serve as the right winger. The lineup is relatively neat. In today's battle, I don't know who will win. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>(Zhenru) Jiang Zongxin Feng Yunyou Chen Zhenhe Chen Bingxiang</p>
<p>Zhuang Shihong Tong Rongwen Fu Hexuan</p>

<p>— Haike</p>
<p>A male guest (at a banquet of one or two hundred people, speaking to a female guest he doesn't know very well)—Tonight’s banquet is huge. There are a lot of men and women who don’t know each other. I don’t even know the host.</p>
<p>A female guest—Then how did you come, sir?</p>
<p>A male guest—I was dragged here by a friend. But after coming, I felt very regretful. Look at that host. He is a miser of the first rank. How can he entertain guests with such terrible food? Madam, do you know the host?</p>
<p>A female guest—I’m very sorry to say that he is my husband.</p>
<p>Man—My love, I had a dream last night. In the dream, I was proposing to you. I wonder what this foreshadows.</p>
<p>Woman—This is sufficient proof that you are more conscious when you are asleep than when you are awake.</p>
<p>A—I heard you recently moved. What is your new landlord like? Is he a good acquaintance?</p>
<p>B—There’s nothing else wrong with him. It’s a pity that he is too curious. In less than a month, he has already been asking when I will pay the rent. And I happen to be most afraid of this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Father (bursting into the room, seeing his daughter sitting on a young man’s lap)—Oh! This is outrageous! In the past, when I and your mother were in love, we corresponded with each other.</p>
<p>Daughter—Times have changed. Everything is about economy now. Like this, we can save postage on the one hand, and save time writing letters on the other.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Travel Musings in Japan <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Liu Xiaoguang, accompanied Mr. Miao Picheng, the former Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, to Japan for an inspection three months ago. He returned to China yesterday upon completion of his duties. Colleagues from our newspaper hosted a banquet to welcome him back. During the meal, he described the customs of the Japanese islands and shared his observations and feelings, many of which are worth recording. I am thus relaying them here.</p>
<p>The Restoration of Tokyo After the Earthquake: The Tokyo earthquake was the most significant loss in Japanese history, amounting to hundreds of millions. However, visiting the area now, one sees towering buildings and splendid architecture, pleasing to the eye. All aspects of urban construction, such as roads and parks, are even more advanced than before the earthquake. Trying to find remnants of broken tiles and collapsed walls from the earthquake is simply impossible. Moreover, the Japanese, having witnessed the devastation of the earthquake, have built exceptionally sturdy structures in the reconstruction era. Their foresight and perseverance are admirable.</p>
<p>The Passion for Baseball: The Japanese have an unbelievable passion for baseball. One day, during the National Middle School Baseball Tournament, the night before tickets went on sale, the area in front of the stadium was already filled with tents. Spectators, fearing they wouldn't be able to buy tickets, were willing to brave the wind and frost to wait. With so many spectators, those standing further back struggled to see the whole field. As a result, temporary oil drum vendors emerged, charging several yuan to allow spectators to stand on them for a better view. Their business boomed instantly, and they sold out completely. One person, injured in the foot due to the crowd, rushed out of the stadium. After a quick bandage at the hospital, he hurried back. Such fervent enthusiasm is truly rare in the world.</p>
<p>The Diligence and Thrift of Housewives: The Japanese highly value women who manage household affairs and do not engage in external matters. Their frugality is especially commendable. Mr. Liu mentioned seeing a wealthy family with assets of no less than several hundred thousand. Yet, the housewife personally handled the tasks of drawing water and pounding rice, without relying on a single servant. However, she had a unique fondness for flowers and plants. In her garden, there were many pine trees, and she specially hired a renowned craftsman to tend to them, paying him five jiao per day. It took three months to complete the task, costing no less than several hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Public Umbrellas: The Japanese value honesty. Its effectiveness can be seen in the smallest details. In public places, there are often public umbrellas available for loan. When it rains, those without rain gear can take one. After use, they are returned to the original place. It is unheard of for someone to borrow one and not return it.</p>
<p>A Nation Full of Interesting Contradictions: Japan strives to study science but also values its inherent old morals. Therefore, foreigners often see many contradictions. Yet, the Japanese uniquely blend new and old ideas seamlessly, like water and milk. This is truly remarkable. Hence, Westerners often call it an interesting nation.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Economic Downturn: The economic downturn in Japan, as reported in newspapers, became even more apparent after arriving there. Major Japanese cities have dozens of department stores, such as Sincere and Wing On. However, upon entering them, one finds few customers and an exceptionally deserted atmosphere. Fear of unemployment is visible everywhere. The government's relief measures consist of lending capital to enable people to make a living or distributing relief goods to prevent people from freezing and starving. However, the effects are minimal. Most amusingly, the unemployed often place a large wooden frame inscribed with their resumes on the main thoroughfare, standing behind the frame, waiting to be hired. This is indeed a pitiful sight.</p>
<p>The Fanatical Worship of the Emperor: The Japanese have immense reverence for the Emperor, treating him as a deity. This is true not only for adults but also for ordinary elementary school students. Mr. Liu visited an elementary school during dismissal time. The students, passing under the Emperor's portrait, all gave the highest salute, solemnly and respectfully. This is truly admirable. One can see the effectiveness of their education.</p>
<p>Tears Flow Uncontrollably at the Sad Reality: Mr. Liu's observations led him to realize that Japan, through diligent effort and vigorous advancement over several decades, has become a wealthy and powerful civilized nation in the world. The training of its people and the establishment of its political system, when compared to our country, make one feel utterly ashamed. During a conversation with someone, he couldn't help but shed tears at the sad reality. The people of our country should know what to strive for!</p>
<h3 id="e126">A Unique Case of Lovers' Suicide <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Junshan</p>
<p>The newspaper recently reported that Mr. Liu of Chih Chih College died tragically after being struck by a speeding train while crossing the tracks in front of the school during his lunch break.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu was my close friend. He was gentle, excelled in literature, and was good at socializing. He was particularly close to a certain lady. The shocking news has left me stunned and grief-stricken. Had Mr. Liu not had a deep affection for that lady (who has served as empress), why would he have transferred from the Faculty of Political Science to Far Eastern University? When Far Eastern University closed, he returned to the Faculty of Political Science. Later, upon hearing that the lady had enrolled at Chih Chih College, he transferred to Chih Chih this spring. Three times he moved schools, only to meet this unfortunate end. Alas, what a tragedy!</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Chinese Who Delight in Eating Raw Things <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Jiyuyi</p>
<p>The Japanese savage eats raw things. Once, a troupe performed publicly at the Great World entertainment center. Recently, my friend Mr. He came to Shanghai and spoke of the eccentric nature of Snake-catching A-bao from Dongpu, who surpasses even the Japanese savage. I am thus hurrying to record and publish this to entertain the readers.</p>
<p>A-bao, surnamed Chen, learned accounting in his youth. He could identify silver dollars without looking, recognizing them by sound alone. As he grew up, he became rebellious and violent, squandering money without restraint, and eventually dissipating all the family property. As a result, his reputation was ruined, yet he refused to correct his ways and roamed about aimlessly, showing no concern for making a living. His wife died early, leaving behind a daughter, who married and lived alone in a small room. She never spoke of poverty, but her eyesight was sharp, able to discern the finest details in the dark. Therefore, the villagers urged him to work as a night watchman, and after repeated requests, he reluctantly agreed. Dongpu is known for producing wine, and wealthy families all brewed their own. From the moment A-bao became the night watchman, he stayed up all night, the sound of his clapper never ceasing. The wine-making equipment was left out in the open, and he never worried about any loss. Unaccustomed to making a living, he was able to fulfill his duties. This alone is remarkable.</p>
<p>In his sixties, with a dark complexion and squinting eyes, hunched over and fierce-looking, he was still vigorous and active, lurking during the day and coming out at night. He had a lifelong fondness for eating poisonous creatures. Snakes, frogs, spiders, centipedes, geckos, millipedes, and other filthy insects – none escaped his grasp. He would swallow them whole and alive, without washing or chewing. If not, he would barely touch them with his lips and swallow them whole before they died. It only took an instant.</p>
<p>When eating snakes, he would first bite off the head, suck the blood from the neck, and then chew the bones and skin with relish. Larger snakes had to be eaten with sorghum wine, otherwise, half a snake would be enough to fill his stomach. Any more would be too much. People who knew his nature would often tease him with wine, and he would catch snakes from his pocket and perform. This was not just to show off his unique abilities but also because it pleased him.</p>
<p>One year, a Western doctor offered 500 gold coins to buy his body, intending to let him live out his days and then dissect him. The owner of the Great World also heard of his uniqueness and offered a generous sum to hire him to Shanghai, but A-bao refused both times, and it never happened. Moreover, passing by him on a hot, humid day, the foul and strange odor was unbearable. This shows the distinctiveness of his flesh.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Roman Art Observation Notes (V) <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>(1) The Vatican Museum, located next to the current papal palace, is the largest in the world. The Louvre in Paris cannot compare. According to the guide, there are a total of 800 exhibition rooms. Not only is the building vast, but it also houses a wealth of historically renowned artworks. The works of the three great masters of the Renaissance are all found here. Furthermore, there are countless rare ancient sculptures and crafts from around the world. I spent two consecutive days viewing them. Here are my notes on a few important famous paintings.</p>
<p>Upstairs, there are four large Raphael fresco rooms, all with religious themes. Some were painted with the help of his students, but two of them are Raphael's own works. (I've already mentioned Raphael's work above.) There is also the Raphael Gallery, over half a kilometer long, which used to be the residence of the Roman Pope. Raphael gained the Pope's favor by painting this gallery, and it is now named in his memory. Leaving the gallery and going left, there are six large exhibition rooms, all containing modern Italian religious paintings. The techniques lean towards realism, and the colors are bright and vibrant, yet they still maintain the traditions of ancient painting.</p>
<p>(2) The Sistine Chapel: This chapel is famous throughout the world and contains Michelangelo's ceiling paintings and the masterpiece "The Last Judgment." The ceiling painting was started in 1508 and completed in 1522, representing Michelangelo's unparalleled masterpiece. The center of the ceiling depicts events from the creation of the world. The important themes are "The Garden of Eden," "The Expulsion from Paradise," and "The Creation of Mankind," distributed across three sides. Next, it depicts "The Flood," expressing humanity's despair, terror, trembling, anger, violence, sorrow, and other extreme emotions. Furthermore, the depicted God is the embodiment of unlimited natural power, reaching the highest level of sternness. Twenty years after the completion of this painting, he painted the large fresco in the center, another astonishing masterpiece, "The Last Judgment." The original is over ten zhang high and over six zhang wide. Seeing Michelangelo's two great masterpieces together, one can see the difference in style. The ceiling painting is rich in decoration, while "The Last Judgment" emphasizes tension. Everywhere, human tension is used to express divinity. Michelangelo spent seven years on his second masterpiece. The center of the painting is Christ, with Mary on his left and the apostles and martyrs on his right, each carrying instruments of torture and pleading their grievances to Christ. In the upper right, angels come flying in, carrying the cross, and seven angels blow trumpets, resurrecting the dead from their graves, so that everyone can receive the Last Judgment. Some attain eternal happiness, while others are sent to eternal hell. Each part of the painting is full of life. These two large paintings are truly the essence of Renaissance art. Michelangelo had such a great artistic creation that later generations often called him a heroic model of an artist. This is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>When Michelangelo painted "The Last Judgment," he was greatly influenced by Dante's literature. The lower part of the painting depicts the scene of passengers in a boat about to capsize. The tense expression is all derived from the poetic imagery of Dante.</p>
<p>In addition to the two great masterpieces in the chapel, there are also over ten famous works from the early Renaissance, but due to their high placement, I did not examine them in detail.</p>
<p>The abundance of Roman antiquities cannot be described in a short article. What I have written above is just some of my personal impressions after my visit. The important thing is the focus on art. I will spare further details about other scenic spots and historical aspects.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Tears Fall All Around, Mourning Crimson Love; A Heart Sways, Lingering Green Intent</p>
<p>Young Master Yin thought secretly, "This time, Gengsheng has fallen into my trap." But when he stepped out of the carriage and looked around, he was a little alarmed. It turned out that this alley was his own property. "Had I known this earlier, I would have come myself. Why bother having Gengsheng lead me here after such a roundabout route? I never imagined that the golden house where Grandpa hides his beauty is actually within my own treasure. It's laughable that we've all been kept in the dark." Following Gengsheng's instructions, he walked into the fifth house in the alley. He saw a sign posted on the door, which read "So-and-so Real Estate Company Office." He thought, "This can't be right. Why is it a real estate company? Could Gengsheng be playing tricks, pointing east while talking west, and fooling me?" He looked at the location of the house and the number on the doorplate and returned to the carriage, saying, "Gengsheng, this isn't right. It's a real estate company. Are you sure you didn't misremember? Isn't it the fifth house?" Gengsheng laughed, "How could I misremember? I come here several times a day. The real estate company is the same as the small mansion, and the small mansion is the same as the real estate company." After all, the young master is clever. He has read detective novels and quickly realized what was going on. He said, "So that real estate company is just a front?" Gengsheng said, "That's not necessarily true. I heard that Uncle Yu and the others originally wanted to establish a real estate company and discussed it with our master. So it was set up there. The concubine lives there alone, and she doesn't need so much space. So the concubine lives on one floor, and the downstairs is used as the real estate company. Fortunately, there's no one in the real estate company. Even when they have meetings, they go elsewhere. All there is is a desk, a mailbox, and a chair, and Master had Mr. Pan, the rent collector from this alley, take care of it. Anyway, it's his own property, so it doesn't cost any money. And it's not convenient to rent the downstairs to someone else, so he set up a real estate company. But in reality, there's no one downstairs. Haven't you noticed that the main door is always closed? If it were a real company, there would be lots of people coming and going. How could the main door stay closed?" The young master thought, "What kind of real estate company is Grandpa running? Is he buying some sort of mobile real estate?" So he asked, "Is this definitely Grandpa's small mansion?" Gengsheng said, "Of course it is. How could I be wrong? I wasn't supposed to bring you to see it. But since Master has already let the cat out of the bag, it's none of my business." The young master said, "I'm afraid you mixed up the house number. When I come back to pick up the concubine, I don't want to end up at the wrong house and cause a scene." "Since it's definitely the right one, then that's settled." So on this day, the young master finally recognized his grandfather's small mansion. At least he accomplished something for his mother. He felt that the two hundred yuan wasn't spent in vain. The mission to investigate was something he could report back on tomorrow. He also repeatedly instructed Gengsheng not to mention it when Master returned. Gengsheng naturally didn't care and wouldn't mention it.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Financial and Gold Market Variations Abound <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Market Sentiment: Suddenly Softening Yesterday, the gold market on the 24th was unusually chaotic, rising and falling unpredictably, leaving people feeling lost and uncertain. Ultimately, it trended downwards, with fluctuations of three to four taels at a time. The total fluctuation for the day was five taels. Foreign exchange rates varied slightly with a slight turn, finally becoming loose and tight. Banks were unwilling to sell. Transactions seemed to be mostly hedging, and market buying and selling were uneven. Industry psychology appeared to soften but was inconsistent, with traders drifting around, unsure of what to do. Chenfeng, Yongyi, Fengyongzhi, Fengyong, etc., were buyers, while Hengxing, Yuanmaoyong, Yuancheng, etc., were sellers. Fuchang, Yuancheng, Yongtai, and Kangrun occasionally sought supply. Although the overseas silver market was low, it did not move as it was only a slight contraction. Therefore, the gold price initially opened low, then turned from weakness to sharpness, once breaking through 85 taels due to rumors that Datong was continuing to absorb cash and foreign exchange rates appeared to be firm. Traders rushed to buy, but as hedgers had already sold, it failed to sustain, and suddenly plummeted four to five taels. Later, Dalienbang and Fuxingyong, etc., all sold off, while Zhifengyong bought in. Others were unsure. As the price dropped slightly, it suddenly fell to the 80-tael mark, and exchange rates also loosened, finally leveling off outside of 81 taels. In short, after a large increase, a small correction is expected, and the silver market may turn upwards today, it is said.</p>
<p>Early Trading Slightly Down, Afternoon Closing Greatly Down This morning, the opening price for December gold was slightly down by 7 qian, at 584 taels and 3 qian (gross, with a fluctuation of about one tael before and after four taels). Shunli and Wanxing were already selling. The bulk orders had initially shrunk the day before but only accounted for one-eighth, and the silver price was also down by one-quarter, causing market sentiment to soften. Soon after, Chunyuanyong, Dadecheng, Taikangrun, etc., all sold off, continuing to fall by over three taels. Dalien initially issued 1 tael 2 qian 9 fen 25 from Datong, after which Zhengjin only issued 1 tael 2 qian 9 fen. Furthermore, the British gold price for this month was 17125 from Datong, but when the first order was posted, it was lowered to 81 taels 56 qian, a posted price of 1 tael 1 qian 2 qian. After a short period, there was a fluctuation of a few qian, fluctuating within one tael. Subsequently, adding one and a half taels, then retreating one tael three or four qian, after 10 o'clock, Dadecheng, Fuchangyuan, Hengyuancheng, and Yongdeng all competed to buy. In addition, the British gold price improved, and Datong absorbed 1725 for December. There were also rumors that Zhejiang and Mitsubishi were doing January US dollar deals at 38 yuan 875, and Sumitomo issued November Japanese gold at 1 tael 2 qian 9 fen, and especially rumors that Datong was bringing in cash, so market sentiment suddenly rose, with a tendency to leap thousands of feet. It soared four taels and several qian, and at just over 10:20 AM, it reached 85 and a half taels. However, hedgers had already sold off, and Yuancheng Yongyu Dayuancheng, Jin'an Tong, Taichang, Hengxing, etc., followed suit, selling off one after another, and in an instant, it was almost like a river flowing downwards, falling five taels. The foreign exchange market weakened. This month, the US dollar was trading at 38 yuan 75, and Yuanheng sold to Sumitomo at 39 yuan for January. By 11:15 AM, it was only 80 taels and 7 qian, suddenly jumping up two or three taels, calculated as three taels four or five qian. However, buyers were again sensitive, but market sentiment was unstable and still in a state of weakness. Yu Da and others tended to sell. After 11:45 AM, it suddenly became 80 taels and 5 qian. Yuancheng Taiheng Yuanlai entered, and in just a few minutes, it pulled up again by two taels, zero at noon. It was two taels and eight qian, and then at the close, it returned to two taels and one qian, again fluctuating by a few qian from two and a half taels to two taels. The market was truly chaotic and difficult to fathom. The posted price was 628 taels and 2 qian, with a discount of 46 to 47 taels, dropping to 43 taels at noon and 46 taels.</p>
<p>Evening Market Mediocre, Ending Weak After the opening, the market was at 82 taels, then 81 taels and 78 qian, with little trading. Soon after, Taikangrun Taihengyuan Laijin added over one tael, calculated as 82 taels and 3 qian. After 2:15 PM, it gradually went downstream due to hearing that Indian exchange rates were increasing by one anna, and it retreated to over 81 taels. The foreign exchange market also loosened. Anda and Sumitomo traded January US dollars at 39 yuan, and Sumitomo issued January Japanese gold at 1 tael 2 qian 8 fen 0625. After entering the market, Yu Da, Zhifengyong, Fuxingyong, etc., tended to sell off, and by 3:30 PM, it had broken through the 80-tael mark, finally at 79 taels and 8 qian. Afterwards, Zhifengyong re-entered, and the items for hedging were also purchased, so at 3:30 PM, it was 81 taels 34 qian. After 4 o'clock, because the December British gold price was sold at 173125, it was again suppressed to 80 taels 034 qian. As it approached the closing time, Zhifengyong and others eagerly sought to enter, and in an instant, it raised by over one tael. At the 4:30 PM closing, it was calculated as 81 taels and 8 qian, a decline of 3 taels and 2 qian compared to the previous day. It was again made to 1 tael 56 qian. The highest price before and after the market was 85 and a half taels, and the lowest price was 79 taels and 8 qian, a difference of 5 taels and 7 qian. The posted price was calculated as a discount of over 46 taels. The ledger showed 95 taels for this month, 91 taels for next month, and 82 taels for December. The make-up water was the same at 95 taels. The opening price for goods was 4 taels and 4 qian, the afternoon closing was 2 taels and a half, and the afternoon closing was 1 tael and a half.</p>
<p>The Confused State of Transactions Among the Exchanges The transactions among the various firms were divergent. Yifengyong, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Chunyuanyong, Chenfengyong, and small-scale short sellers all entered. Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yuancheng Yongshunli, Wanxing, Taikangrun, Yu Da, etc., came and went, chaotic and uncertain. Yuancheng, Yongheng, Hengxing, Taixing, and Yuanmaoyong all sold off. In the afternoon, Yu Da and Taikangrun, and Zhifengyong fluctuated. Wanxing and Shunli had more supply than demand. Dadecheng bought goods, while Taixing and Yuxingyong all sold. There were also differences in the cashiers of various firms, but there were no large sums. Dalienbang bought 1,000-odd bars and sold over 2,000 to hedge exchange rates. Guangbang sold 1,000 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Exchange Rates Show Signs of Loosening <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silver markets continued to decline, and British and American exchange rates also fell. However, Japanese and American exchange rates still rose. The exchange rate posted by HSBC was no different from the post-modification exchange rate of the previous day. However, the internal market of banks seemed to have a turnaround. Initially, it was still flat, but later, the gold market trended downwards, and exchange rates followed, loosening. Finally, it showed profit because those covering were very eager, and the gold price had broken through 85 taels. Almost at noon, it turned looser, and after noon, it was peaceful, and finally, it weakened, but the gold price also softened slightly. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British gold price rose by 1875, the US dollar price rose by 25, and the Japanese gold price fell by 75. This was the reaction after repeated tightening. Chinese merchants in the gold industry and Dalienbang still had coverings to sell off gold, but not as much as the previous day. The British gold transaction was over 100,000 pounds. Banks such as Shanghai, Datong, and Guangdong all sold off, while Zhengjin, Mitsui, Zhejiang, and Datong bought in. Furthermore, various banks traded tens of thousands of pounds, and traded 200 to 300,000 US dollars. Chinese merchants bought and sold 100,000-odd yuan. As for Dalienbang and Tong Taichang, they entered 2 million-odd yuan of Dalien bills and Japanese exchange rates. Banks such as Datong, Korean Zhengjin, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo all sold off.

Later, the buying side's purchases became slightly active, and the selling side did not have large sales, so the price gradually recovered. Other trends remained peaceful. As a result, compared to the previous day, consolidation futures and 1929 Customs bonds for the eleventh period each rebounded by 6-7 jiao. Other bonds only saw a few jiao in price fluctuations.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Yarn and Cotton: Initial Rise and Subsequent Stability in the Marked Yarn Market <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then stabilized. However, the overseas cotton yarn market tended to rise, slightly exciting the local market. The failure to rise significantly was due to the sluggish sales of current yarn and the lack of activity in various firms, leading to a dispersed atmosphere. With a sufficient supply of goods this month, the market price remained weak. If demand for current yarn can improve, the market may rise.</p>
<p>The Marked Yarn Market is Weak in the Near Term and Strong in the Distant Term. The opening of the marked yarn market was stronger due to the rise in American cotton, with each month rising by 8-9 qian. The market suddenly fell in the second and third sessions due to poor actual sales. As a result, the current month fell by 5 qian, and the distant months rose by 2-4-5-7 qian. The afternoon market was flat, with each month falling by 1-2 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 21,400 bales. Among the sellers, Da Ji sold 1,250 bales, Yi Cheng sold 1,300 bales, Li Chang sold 1,000 bales, Han Feng sold 1,250 bales, Rong Xing sold 900 bales, and the rest sold 300-400-600-700 bales. Among the buyers, Tian Cheng bought 1,550 bales, Yi Yu bought 2,300 bales, Shen Ji bought 700 bales, Xie Sheng bought 700 bales, and the rest bought 300-500 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Closing Prices - Change - Inventory - Closing Prices - Change - Inventory - Account Numbers</p>
<p>October 1474 - Down 6 - 15600 - January 1485 - Up 23 - 9500</p>
<p>November 1483 - Up 1 - 3500 - February 1487 - Up 3 - 32100</p>

<p>Sluggish Current Sales: Current yarn sales were sluggish. Statistics show that various firms bought a total of 666 bales throughout the day. Counterparts bought 250 bales, with prices falling by 2.5 qian. Among the customer firms, 95 bales were shipped to the interior, 36 bales to Yunnan, 175 bales to Sichuan, 115 bales to Shantou, 60 bales to Guangdong, 40 bales to Jiangxi, 30 bales to Xiamen, 35 bales to Changsha, and 80 bales to miscellaneous firms, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Strong Cotton Market Rebound <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market suddenly rose sharply and reacted violently. The main reason was that the long-sluggish American cotton suddenly rose by 20-30 points, greatly improving market sentiment. Moreover, the fire-damaged cotton standard had to be lowered by 5 qian, further tightening the situation. Smallholders sold off in large quantities, with prices rising by 4-5 qian. However, the Han firms sold off slightly. If American cotton can stabilize, the cotton market may rise again.</p>
<p>The Han Standard Rebounded by 5 Qian. The opening of the Han standard market was tense due to the sudden rise in American cotton, and buyers poured in. Each month rose by 3-4 qian, but no one bought the current month, so it was flat. In the afternoon, there were still many buyers, and the market situation was still good. Each month rose by 5 fen to 1 qian. The current month fell by 1.5 qian. Statistics show that Li Chang sold 4,900 dan, Yuan Da sold 3,300 dan, Shen Chang sold 4,100 dan, Geng Feng sold 2,100 dan, and the rest sold 1,100-200-300 dan. Among the buyers, Xin Cheng bought 9,500 dan, Tong Xing bought 3,100 dan, Gong Tai bought 4,600 dan, and the rest bought 1,000-2,000 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>American cotton buying power was very strong. Yesterday, American cotton's current market was smooth, and Wall Street strongly bought in, causing the market to rise firmly. Futures rose by 24-22 points, and the current market rose by 30 points. English cotton futures rose by 18 points, and the current market rose by 5 points. Egyptian cotton current market rose by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was weak, with Pingguoer and Bairuoxi falling by 2 rupees and Aomla falling by 1 rupee.

<p>In Zhabei yesterday, the source of goods from various firms exceeded thirty. Due to the sunny weather, sales slowed down. New early rice and high-quality early rice were still similar to the previous day, opening at 15 yuan, while medium-grade and below were slightly lower by 2-3 jiao. The market was extremely flat and weak. Late rice arrivals were scarce and sales were stagnant, with no ups or downs. The source of Yangjian rice was depleted, and prices could not be reduced. The general price still opened at 11 yuan and 5-6 jiao. The buying sentiment for Dujian rice was sluggish, and the situation was slightly soft, down 1 jiao. The top price opened at 12 yuan. The stock of customer goods was low, and most of the goods were lost in transit, so the shipments to Shanghai were greatly reduced. Therefore, the market was uniquely firm. The top price for 2 jiao pier rice opened at 11 yuan and 2 jiao. The market for old Baiyuan rice was more active, and high-quality goods were quite tight, opening at 15 yuan and 5 jiao. The buying of Yinyuan standing on consignment was also brisk, and the quoted price was neither high nor low.</p>
<p>In South Shanghai yesterday, over twenty boats arrived at the river, and local sales were flat and normal. The new early rice from regular firms showed a stable state, opening high at 14 yuan and 7 jiao. The digestion of Su Tong Bai rice was sluggish and flat, with only a few scattered inquiries. There were no ups or downs in the market. The stomach for the new thin rice from Nanbang Qingding was slightly active, and store sales were also active. The market price for high-quality goods had to be at 14 yuan. The price of Yang Dujian rice was generally stable, opening high at 10 yuan and 5 jiao. The market for early and late rice here was extremely sluggish and stable. If the sky could be sunny, it would have to be reduced. The range was around 14 yuan and 5 jiao, with no hope of going too low for the time being. The overall trend was quite flat and normal. Yinyuan was similar to the North Shanghai market, with the top price opening at 14 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Continued Procurement of Hakka Rice from Fuzhou <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the arrival of Hakka rice was small, sales were also weak, and the market remained flat. Local and rural areas had no intention of inquiring due to the arrival of goods from the interior and the arrival of rice transported by train. However, the procurement intention of the Fuzhou firms was still good, and the North Ocean firms also inquired. The market remained firm, and high-quality rice showed a strong trend. It is estimated that over 1,000 bags of early Jiangxi machine rice were traded at prices ranging from 10 yuan and 6 jiao to 10 yuan. The North firms only took 200-300 bags, and the rest were taken by the South route, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Marked Vermicelli Plummets with the Tianjin Market <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially showed stability and then fell. Initially, the quotation of foreign wheat fluctuated very little, and market sentiment was still stable. Later, the Tianjin spot flour market suddenly fell by a huge 8 fen (currently opening at 3 yuan, 3 jiao, and 8 fen) due to reports of sluggish sales and accumulated inventory, as well as the sale of foreign flour by Japanese merchants. This dealt a blow to the initially positive market sentiment. The poor Tianjin market was no different from the excessive rise in Shanghai flour. Later, due to the sharp fall in the current month's standard, insiders and outsiders were inevitably bearish again, and large bulls successively withdrew their positions. Therefore, each month showed an extremely weak and sluggish state. Observing the subsequent steps, if sales do not improve and there are no special changes in foreign wheat, it is feared that the market will fall again. As a result, the current month fell by 1 fen and 7.5 li compared to the previous day, November fell by 1.5 fen, December fell by 1 fen and 7.5 li, January fell by 1.5 fen, and February and March each fell by 1 fen and 7.5 li, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Near-Term Wheat Plummets by 1.2 Qian <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the current month's opening price of wheat futures was similar to the previous day. Subsequently, the bulls' thoughts on taking delivery suddenly changed because the market price of the current month differed from November by approximately 2 qian, making it not very worthwhile to take delivery. Moreover, with the slackening of flour sales, flour mills had no appetite. Therefore, almost all positions were returned yesterday, and the stabilized market also immediately shook. The market plummeted, falling by 1.2 qian compared to the previous day's closing price. The large fluctuations were quite alarming. The distant months also slightly weakened, but buying interest was still strong, and the difference in prices was very small. As a result, the current month fell by 1.2 qian compared to the previous day, November fell by 2 fen, December fell by 4 fen, January fell by 3 fen, and February fell by 1 fen. There were no changes in March. The current wheat market showed weakness again. With the sharp fall in the standard, market sentiment softened. Two thousand bags of wheat from Tongsheng, Kaidaoren Bridge, Jiujiang, Suqian, and Zhumadian were on offer. Flour mills took a small portion, and the rest were still in the hands of brokers, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Grain Exchange Reviews and Approves Foreign Wheat, <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Grade Increase Method is a Fatal Blow to Local Wheat</p>
<p>The Grain Exchange, in view of the fact that the quantity of foreign wheat ordered by various factories and firms this year has reached over 100,000 tons, deemed it necessary to review and approve the standard in advance to avoid future confusion. Yesterday, the Wheat Group of the exchange convened all committee members and inspectors to conduct research. However, the issue of upgrading foreign wheat involved significant interests for both bulls and bears, and a heated debate ensued. Those who had contracted foreign wheat naturally argued for an increase in market value, while those who had not contracted were concerned about the source of local wheat and would not allow foreign wheat to overshadow it. It was pointed out on the spot that the weight of the arriving Australian No. 2 wheat was only 144 catties per bag, which was much lower than in previous years. Therefore, a compromise was reached, and it was agreed that Australian large-bag No. 2 wheat would be upgraded by 2.5 qian compared to the standard, small-bag would be upgraded by 2 qian, Canadian No. 3 wheat would be upgraded by 2 qian, and No. 4 wheat would be upgraded by 1 qian. With the agreement of the public, future foreign wheat deliveries will be handled accordingly, which will naturally avoid problems. However, from a factual standpoint, this upgrade poses a great danger to the future of local wheat. The consideration for upgrading foreign wheat is based on the high quality of its goods and its own heavy weight. However, this year, the quality of Shandong Bai wheat is higher than that of foreign wheat, with each stone weighing 150 catties. However, when delivered to the exchange, its due rights are only to increase by 2 grades according to regulations, totaling 6 fen, and after deducting 3 catties of soil, at most 1.6 qian will be upgraded according to the standard. Since the quality and weight are both higher than foreign wheat, the upgrade is less than that of foreign goods, which seems unfair in practice. In addition, as foreign goods sell more and more each day, the main agricultural products are also being suppressed in price for no reason, which is not a blessing for the entire society, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Dried Goods and Nuts: Walnut Sales Still Good Among Various Firms, <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Market Situation is Flat</p>
<p>The arrival of walnuts has been scarce recently, and customer goods continue to be offered for sale. The prices of medium- and low-grade goods are 11 taels and 2 qian to 12 taels, followed by 10 taels to 9 taels and 5 qian. It is estimated that the total inventory on the market is approximately 2,000 bags. The trend is flat. The current market sales are mostly for local mainlanders for high-grade goods, and the middle- and low-grade goods are more active in Jiangning, Bowen, and Taizhou. The peach firms initially sold at 11 taels and 5 qian to 12 taels and 5 qian, Ji Tao at 10 taels and 5 qian, and Dong Tao at 10 taels. Top-grade peaches such as Tianjin goods sold at 15 taels to 16 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firms' silk market became even more lonely because the European and American markets were experiencing changes in the economic sector, and the silk sales of various silk factories suddenly became sluggish. Silk prices fell sharply, and the market atmosphere was silent due to the lack of telegraphic orders. Yesterday, only Zhonghe entered 10 bales of white dry silk, and Xiangji entered 8 bales of coarse yellow silk. Prices were generally flat and weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Russian Assistance Association began to inspect Tunxi Zhenmei tea, and there was actually a motivation to start operations. Many English firms also heard the news and became interested. The long-depressed Tunxi Zhenmei tea market showed a glimmer of hope. However, the market price has fallen to a very low level. Even if it can be sold at the market price, the sales of black tea are still sluggish.</p>

<p>The hardware market trend has been improving since after the holiday. Although progress has been seen, the Beilu war has ended, but business has not recovered, so there are not many purchases. Therefore, the transaction volume of various goods in Shanghai is not large. Due to oversupply, the standard has been declining. Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign exchange rate successively increased, invisibly raising the cost of various goods. Therefore, Shanghai colleagues are discussing price increases due to capital concerns. Currently, the market is like bamboo joints. For example, 96-7 taels and 2 li and a half for section iron, 9 taels and 5 qian and a half for English copper plates, 7 taels, 5 qian and 7 li and a half, 6 taels and 7 qian and a half, 1 fen, 6 taels and 5 qian. In ordinary iron, American goods such as 48 sheets are sold for 17 taels and 2 qian and a half, 28 for 18 taels and 3 qian, 26 for 17 taels and 2 qian and a half, and 24 for 15 taels and 2 qian and a half. English goods such as 50 sheets of Red Bird brand are sold for 16 taels and 5 qian, 28 for 15 taels, 26 for 14 taels, and 24 for 12 taels and 3 qian and a half. 200-pound Huesis iron is 22 taels, 1-6 inch yuan nails are 7 taels and 2 qian and a half, 28-gauge tile iron is 14 taels and 2 qian and a half, 26-gauge is 12 taels and 5 qian, and 24-gauge is 11 taels and 7 qian and a half. Green lead is 14 taels and 5 qian, Dutch tin is 106 taels, and smoked leather iron is 11 taels and 5 qian. Other items such as red copper, new silver coins, angle iron, and new road leather are all gradually increasing in price.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Chairman Chiang and Wife Returned to Native Place Yesterday <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Madam Soong Went East to Recuperate</p>
<p>Chiang and Others Personally Saw Her Off at the Wharf</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang of the National Government, accompanied by his wife, Madam Soong Mei-ling, and more than ten guards, took the Ning Shao Company's Xin Ning Shao ship to Yongbo around 5 p.m. yesterday, transferring to Fenghua, their ancestral home. Prior to this, the military and police authorities, upon Chairman Chiang's instructions, were not permitted to put on a show. Therefore, only a few dozen policemen dispatched by the Public Security Bureau maintained order around the Ning Shao wharf at the 16th Pier temporarily. There were no troops or military bands etc. to add to the spectacle.</p>
<p>Those who went to the wharf yesterday afternoon to see them off included Xiong Shihui, Kong Xiangxi, Yu Qiaqing, Chen Xizeng, Yuan Ludeng, and others. The Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Tea Room Workers' Union also hung a banner on the port side of the Xin Ning Shao ship, reading "Welcome Chairman Chiang, who has worked hard and made great contributions, to triumphantly return to his hometown." The Ning Shao Company specially opened up a large first-class cabin for Mr. and Mrs. Chiang, arranging it to be extremely clean. Mr. and Mrs. Chiang arrived at the wharf at 4:40 p.m. yesterday. Madam Soong Mei-ling, together with her elder sister, Ai-ling, first stepped aboard the ship, followed by Chairman Chiang and Minister Kong. Thousands of people swarmed around, vying to catch a glimpse of the Chairman's demeanor. At 5:06 p.m., with a whistle sound, the paddlewheel left the shore.</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang and Minister Kong Xiangxi and his wife accompanied Madam Soong to the east, taking several cars around 7 a.m. yesterday to escort Madam Soong to the east to Japan to recuperate. After arriving at the Xinguang Wharf, they switched to the Customs Huali small boat and transferred to the Grande President ship of the Da Lai Company. It was not until after 9 a.m. that Chiang and others shook hands with Madam Soong to bid farewell. Those who went to Japan on the same ship to serve her included Soong Zi-an and Minister Kong's youngest daughter, and others. It is said that Madam Soong, following the doctor's instructions, plans to reside in Kobe for recuperation and is scheduled to return home in a month.</p>
<p>After Chairman Chiang and his wife sent Madam Soong to the east, they visited Chen Tiaoyuan, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, at Quan Jisifei Road around 10 a.m. yesterday, talked for more than ten minutes, and then left. Then they went to Gordon Road to visit Central Committee Member Yu Youren, and returned to the Soong residence at 11 a.m. Those who came to pay respects included Zhang Jingjiang, Chen Mingshu, Chen Tiaoyuan, Huang Yingbai, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Qun, Chen Guangfu, and others. At noon, Chiang invited Chen Mingshu, Kong Xiangxi, Ye Zhuotang, Chen Xizeng, and others to lunch at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. Around 2 p.m., they returned to their residence on Jiaerye Ai Road, and at 4 p.m., they visited Li Shizeng at the Sino-Western Sanatorium on Pushi Road, and then went to the wharf.</p>

<p>Mo Dehui Remains in Russia to Observe the Situation</p>
<p>The German Envoy's Visit Yesterday Had No Mission</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting met with the German Envoy Büel in the Foreign Affairs Discussion Association on Xiafei Road at ten o'clock yesterday morning, and the German Counselor Belac, the host and guests had a pleasant conversation. After the reporter interviewed the Danish Consul General Long En and others after they resigned, Wang gave an audience and asked about various recent diplomatic issues.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Right: The German Envoy, Center: Foreign Minister Wang (Photographed by This Newspaper) <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Sino-Russian Negotiations Regarding the Sino-Russian negotiation incident, there is a rumor that Mo Dehui has been recalled to China. Wang replied that although Sino-Russian negotiations have recently stalled, Mo Dehui is still staying in Russia to observe the situation and plan for a response. As for the Boli Conference Record, our side will definitely not recognize it. If Russia insists on using this as a basis, the future is particularly bleak.</p>
<p>Extraterritoriality Regarding the negotiations on the abolition of extraterritoriality, Wang stated that British Envoy Lampson will come to Beijing early next month to continue negotiations. As for the Japanese side, he has repeatedly urged the Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi. According to him, he is currently waiting for instructions from the Japanese government and will be able to open discussions once he arrives. Wang also said that French Envoy Weirton will also come south at the beginning of the month to present his credentials and conduct various outstanding cases between China and France.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Entertainment The reporter then asked if the German Envoy's visit this morning had any mission. Wang said that this was an ordinary diplomatic entertainment and had no mission. He was also asked about the issue of Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Nagai's slip of the tongue. Wang made no comment. Foreign Minister Wang hosted a banquet for Belgian Envoy Valoss and his wife at his private residence on Guba Road at eight o'clock last night.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Oppose Japanese Military Drill Attacking Changchun <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Authorities Should Protest Seriously</p>
<p>The People Must Rise Up Together to Oppose</p>
<p>｜｜Joint Telegram Issued by Four Branches｜｜</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Japanese army stationed in the Northeast had the outrageous act of openly practicing attacking Changchun on the 19th of this month. This is truly a great shame to our country and rarely heard in the world. The Japanese imperialists' ambition to invade our country has been completely exposed here. The Ninth, Eighteenth, Twentieth, and Thirtieth Branches of the Third District of this city specially jointly telegraphed the whole country yesterday, requesting the authorities to protest seriously and the people to be aware. The telegram said, "The Japanese imperialists, at a time when the revolutionary atmosphere is permeating the whole country and the domestic warlords are being eliminated one after another, suddenly dared to recklessly practice attacking Changchun, digging trenches and building fortresses, with booming cannons, for three or four hours in the middle of this month in the Northeast of our territory under the pretext of autumn exercises. Their contempt for our sovereignty and insult to our national system have reached their extreme here, and their aggressive ambitions can be further proven here. This kind of strange shame and great humiliation is truly rare in the world and sympathized by the whole country. After the pain and hatred, our branches are determined to deal with it with hot blood. In addition to presenting a serious protest to the diplomatic authorities, we hereby loudly appeal and solemnly declare, hoping that the people of the whole country will unite to oppose it and wash away this strange shame and great humiliation. The party and the country are fortunate. This is a telegram, respectfully printed by the Ninth Branch, the Eighteenth Branch, the Twentieth Branch, and the Thirtieth Branch of the Third District of the Shanghai Special City of the Chinese Kuomintang."</p>

<p>Attending the Fourth Plenary Session in Nanjing</p>
<p>This reporter interviewed Chen Mingshu, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, yesterday and asked about his future whereabouts and whether he would attend the Fourth Plenary Session. He replied that he would stay in Shanghai for a few days and then return to Nanjing temporarily without returning to Guangdong. He would definitely attend the Fourth Plenary Session. He met with Chairman Chiang this morning and discussed matters related to Guangdong.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Yuejun, accompanied by Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, was invited into the living room and warmly received. It is said that Mr. Wang Hout will take over the duties of leading the consulate as the U.S. Consul General Keginhan returns home.

<h3 id="e180">Jiangsu Province Pre-Borrows Winter Grain to Slow Repayment <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Finance Department has recently received reports from the financial bureau chiefs of 14 counties in Shanghai, including Wujin, Wuxian, Wuxi, and Songjiang, stating that the pre-borrowed winter grain still owes four yuan and five jiao per stone. According to Junling's repayment method, nine jiao of foreign money is allocated for each stone starting from the winter grain in the 19th year until the 23rd year, and all will be returned. Now that the winter grain is about to be collected, they should submit a report for review and follow the instructions, etc. After Chen presented the report, the finance minister said that the budget for this year is still insufficient. If repayments are made, it would be difficult in reality. The Provincial Government Committee decided that the pre-borrowed winter grain should be approved for delayed repayment. The Shanghai County Finance Bureau has been ordered by the Finance Department to comply yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Request the Government to Promulgate the Patent Law as Soon as Possible <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Pan Xulun's Proposal at the Industrial and Commercial Conference</p>
<p>Member of the Industrial and Commercial Conference, Accountant Pan Xulun, recently submitted a proposal to the Industrial and Commercial Conference for requesting the government to promulgate the patent law as soon as possible to promote the domestic industry. Those who first invent or specially improve industrial products and manufacturing methods should have the right to patent to encourage them. This is the general practice of various countries. The National Government of our country also promulgated 21 articles of the Provisional Regulations on Encouraging Industrial Products on June 18th of the 17th year, which properly stipulated the procedures for applying for and approving patent rights. Since the implementation of these regulations, many domestic industrialists have followed the regulations to apply and invite approval. This is really the most important step to promote the improvement of industry. However, on July 31st of the 18th year, the National Government issued 7 articles of the Special Industrial Incentive Law and repealed the previously promulgated Provisional Regulations on Encouraging Industrial Products by an edict on April 28th of the 19th year. The government's intention may be that the special manufacturing rights in the Special Industrial Incentive Law can replace the patent rights, but in reality, the special manufacturing rights in the Special Industrial Incentive Law have limited areas, and the term is at most five years. It must be that the industry run by the Chinese people is within the scope listed in the law and has achieved results before it can be applied for. Ordinary patent rights, regardless of Chinese and foreign people, regardless of any industry, can be applied for at the beginning of the invention or improvement to protect and encourage them. Their nature is fundamentally different. Therefore, since the abolition of the Provisional Regulations on Encouraging Industrial Products, according to the experience of Xu Lun personally, there have been many inventors or improvers in the industry who want to apply for patents for their products or methods, but they also suffer from the lack of legal basis and cannot proceed. In the midst of this advocacy of domestic products, the legislative aspect does not seem to be a retrogression. It is proposed that the National Government orders the Legislative Yuan to quickly formulate a special law for the patent rights item to achieve perfection, immediately announce and implement it as an incentive for industrial inventions and improvements. Is it appropriate? I hope the public will decide.</p>

<p>Shanghai Women's Association and China Overseas Chinese Association Public Revelation: Revealing, The Dutch deputy second mate of the Zhazhua Company's Zhibade ship insulted Ms. Xiao Xin'an, a teacher at the Anbu Island China Peide School. When the Chinese people heard about it, they were deeply angry. This matter not only insulted Ms. Xiao personally, but is also related to the survival of our national system and nation. All circles in our country should rise up and jointly organize the Xiao Case Support Association to seek practical assistance and be the backing of diplomacy. Our association has jointly issued a declaration and announced it in the newspaper. It is scheduled to meet on the 25th of this month at 2 p.m. at 17 Chuangu Road, North Sichuan Road.

<h3 id="e185">Three Groups Declare for the Xin Case <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Sixth District Party Department, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association, and the Commercial Press Trade Union, and other three groups, declared for the Xin Dingxiang case: (Title omitted) Our nation, which is lighter than a dragonfly and cheaper than grass, has sacrificed an unknown number under the iron hooves of the imperialists. This is a hate blood chapter of the strong bullying the weak. After we have healed the pain, we don't know where to start. Unexpectedly, in today's humanitarianism, the French sailors who kill people like life dared to shoot and kill our innocent people, Mr. Xin Dingxiang, on the Huangpu Beach in front of everyone's eyes. We only know the French imperialists with hideous faces have long ignored China by virtue of the power of unequal treaties, so the freely acting French sailors dared to use the evil means of trampling on the Chinese nation. We know from the stimulation and understanding of this case that the barbaric actions of the French sailors are by no means any personal problem, but a cannon policy of France, first demonstrating to our nation. At the same time, we know that the lives of our nation have long been in the slave contract of unequal treaties, so the tragic death of Xin Dingxiang is by no means just the misfortune of one Xin, but a slaughter of our entire nation and a barometer, and also a whetstone for the imperialists to destroy our country. Now, if we want to seek liberation from slaves and heaven from hell, we can only rush to the banner of Qingbai to open up a wide road for us to abolish unequal constraints. At the same time, we put forward the following minimum requirements for the French imperialists who arbitrarily harm us. First, we should formally apologize to our government and ensure that similar incidents never happen again. Second, severely punish the original murderers and the patrolmen who privately release the murderers. Third, in addition to paying for the deceased's funeral expenses, we should give the deceased's family alimony in accordance with the precedent of our country compensating foreigners. In addition to the above items, we also have four fundamental requirements, hoping that our country will work together to achieve the purpose of achieving them in the shortest possible time: (1) Revoke the consular jurisdiction; (2) Recover the concessions; (3) Withdraw foreign troops stationed in China; (4) Abolish unequal treaties. If these four cannot be achieved, I am afraid that our 400 million future descendants will eventually be subjected to the imperialists' aggressive knives and saws. Containing blood, the anger is overwhelming.

<h3 id="e186">The Case of Foreign Ship Sailors Getting Pay Increases Has Not Been Decided <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>It Will Not Break Down</p>
<p>A Solution Is Not Far Off</p>
<p>Regarding the case of foreign ship sailors demanding a pay increase, Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Chen Bogang previously acted as mediators on behalf of Taikoo and agreed to add four yuan starting in September and one yuan starting in March next year, which was agreed by the trade union. However, they further requested that the one yuan added next year be given at the same time in September. Mr. Yu must inform Taikoo of this point and reply after agreeing. On Tuesday, the Seamen's Union received a letter from Taikoo, requesting that personnel be sent to the company at 11 a.m. on Thursday to discuss the situation, etc., which has been recorded in the previous report. Yesterday, the reporter met Mr. Wang Yongsheng at the Nanshi Branch. According to him, after receiving the letter from Taikoo, the general union sent Liu Yuzhou, Tan Baojing, and Yu, (Wang claimed himself) to the company yesterday morning. Locke, a Westerner, and Xu, a Chinese comprador, received them. After discussion, they still only agreed to add three yuan starting in September and said that the sailors should be forgiven because business has declined in recent years. They did not mention the one yuan added next year, which is far from what Yu and Chen had agreed, so they dispersed without results and returned to report to the trade union. The trade union saw that Taikoo still had no sincerity, so it sent Wang Yongsheng to meet Yu Qiaqing yesterday afternoon to inform him of the discussion situation in Taikoo the day before and asked whether Taikoo was sincere in resolving the case. Otherwise, it would be dealt with by the second step procedure. Yu said that the case was not difficult to solve. After meeting with the big class in Taikoo tomorrow (that is, today), there will be a definite reply. According to Mr. Wang, the case will definitely not break down with Yu Chen as the mediator, but it is only a matter of time. However, the solution will not be far off.</p>

The presentation to the Executive Yuan stated, "(has been seen in the previous report,) "(omitted,)" etc. The industry rules are related to the survival of the association, and also to the prosperity and decline of an industry. The use of industry rules is to maintain and promote the common interests of the industry, and on the other hand, to correct the abuses of business. There is no abuse of monopoly and manipulation as referred to in various ministries, and it also fits the purpose of the Industry and Commerce Trade Association Law Article 2, which clearly shows the purpose of the trade association. If the association does not have industry rules to maintain it, it will inevitably exist in form only, and if the business does not have industry rules to restrain it, it will inevitably encroach on each other. Our association has seen this, so we initiated and invited various trade associations to send representatives to discuss together. It is scheduled to meet at the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce at the afternoon of the 27th of this month (that is, Monday), except for separate letters, we should write to your association, recommend two to four representatives to attend the meeting at that time, it is related to personal interests, please do not ignore it, to the fullest extent possible.

<p>The Shanghai County Farmers' Education Center, in order to increase agricultural yields and improve the lives of farmers, has established twenty-four special contract farms. Yesterday, it convened a meeting of farmers and decided on seventeen articles of methods. The crop being tested this year is wheat. Seeds were purchased by the Agricultural Education Center from famous farms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Staff from the center will provide monthly guidance. The methods are recorded as follows (Special Contract Farming Methods of the Shanghai County Farmers' Education Center): ㈠ This farm will be selected by the center from the relatively nearby farmland of experienced farmers for special testing and will be named the Shanghai County Farmers' Education Center's Number X Special Contract Farm. ㈡ The purpose of this farm is to test and improve crops.

<h3 id="e193">Opinions of the Domestic Silk and Satin Industry on the Issue of Account Settlement <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xingyi, a standing committee member of the Chinese National Products Preservation Association, recently because the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce regarding the issue of settling accounts using the national calendar, specially recommended five committee members including Wang Yansong to conduct specialized research and properly plan measures, etc. The opinions of the silk and satin industry's business community are now sent to the five committee members in a letter, stating: Respectfully, our association has repeatedly received statements from various industry merchants, factories, and members, claiming that the issue of year-end account settlement, following the national calendar, is extremely important to commercial circulation and should be carefully studied to ensure smooth implementation. Everyone agrees that China is an agricultural country, and the earliness or lateness of store account settlements should be based on agricultural matters. As evidenced by the discussions reported in the newspapers these days regarding the bean and rice industry, the pharmaceutical industry, and the rice milling industry, in the case of the domestic silk and satin industry, there is no problem with when to collect payments for local retail sales. However, for those who specialize in selling to merchant guilds in various provinces, settling accounts at the end of the national calendar year will inevitably create various difficulties. The goods handled by these merchant guilds in Shanghai are transported to those areas and resold, with the majority sold to farmers. They must wait for the harvest of agricultural products before they can exchange them for money to repay the accounts. Now, if we abolish thousands of years of trading habits and issue strict orders at once, it will be difficult to ensure that store accounts are paid off by the end of the national calendar year. Currently, during this period of expensive gold and cheap silver, all commercial sectors are showing signs of decline. This presents an opportunity to develop the domestic goods business. In past years, during the "golden September and silver October" period, it was the peak season for the sales of general merchandise. Unexpectedly, this year's reform of account settlement has led to a sudden change in people's attitudes, with everyone taking a wait-and-see approach. Consequently, the merchant guilds have also become panicked and are sending letters to suspend their business. It is observed that most commercial sectors place emphasis on the winter season. Taking the domestic silk and satin industry as an example, the months of winter and the twelfth lunar month are the peak seasons for the merchant guilds to handle goods for the new year. Therefore, there is a saying that "three seasons are not as good as one winter." If the county magistrate reforms this, it will inevitably cause the loss of the timeliness of handling goods. Not only will businesses have no basis to rely on and suffer extra pain, but the public will also feel that compliance is difficult and be at a loss. The domestic silk and satin industry, at this time of struggling to survive, cannot bear to receive unexpected blows, which would be adding insult to injury. Furthermore, the silver industry associations in the inland counties of Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Danyang, and Wujin have initiated petitions to the provincial government to postpone the account settlement period to the middle of the second month of the next national calendar year. This is truly a good method for understanding the difficulties of businesses and considering the overall business. We believe that merchants and the public are very willing to follow the national calendar, but the issue of commercial account settlement is actually a separate matter that requires careful implementation. Reading the newspapers, we are pleased to learn that you have been commissioned to study the issue of account settlement. We dare not presume to be disrespectful and offer our opinions. We earnestly request that you, based on the opinions of merchants and the public in various regions, and considering all aspects, conduct detailed research and publish your findings as soon as possible to reassure businesses and comply with the situation. We are overwhelmed with public gratitude and await your instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Assistance with Sugar Industry Creditor's Rights <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Datong General Chamber of Commerce, stating: Respectfully, on the 22nd of this month, we received a letter from the Municipal Sugar Industry Association, stating that according to letters from members Yu Daheng and water carrier Zhou Yutang, the Datong Wanhe Nanhua (Southern Goods) Store was opened in [blank] month of this year. In April of this year, the store's manager, Yu Shoutian, absconded with the funds privately, causing the store to close immediately. It was found that the store owed our members over eight thousand four hundred taels of silver for goods, and also owed Zhou Yutang over three thousand taels for goods handled on commission. The Datong side does not owe a single penny. The store's shareholders, including Hong Buqing, are all wealthy locals. Not only do they not settle the debts owed, but they even moved and sold the store's inventory. Fortunately, our members rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and managed to intercept the goods midway, selling them to colleagues there for over two thousand yuan. They also collected several hundred taels from Wanhe's accounts, totaling over three thousand yuan in total. Currently, the amount is being held at the Datong Chamber of Commerce. The remaining debt is being pursued from the store's shareholders, but they have been ignoring the matter for months. Recently, it was heard that all of Wanhe's assets have been divided among the shareholders, with the intention of evading our members' payment for goods. Therefore, in a state of urgency, we are sending this letter to your chamber, requesting that you forward it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which will then forward it to the Datong General Chamber of Commerce, urging the shareholders to repay the full amount as soon as possible. If the shareholders continue to ignore the matter, then our members will seek assistance from the court when filing a lawsuit. After the association received this information, it was determined that the Wanhe Nanhua Store has already suspended operations due to the incident. The debts to both Datong and Shanghai should be handled equally. It is also claimed that the Datong side does not owe a single penny, but they are not taking responsibility for the Shanghai side's creditor's rights, and instead are privately moving the inventory and dividing the assets among the shareholders. This kind of arrangement clearly disregards the debts and severely damages the reputation of merchants. Based on the aforementioned information, we are hereby requesting your chamber to assist us in urging the shareholders of Wanhe Store to repay the debts owed to Yu Daheng and water carrier Zhou Yutang as soon as possible, in order to protect the merchants' capital. We truly appreciate your public spirit and hope to receive your reply. This letter is addressed to the Datong General Chamber of Commerce.</p>

The Guild telegraphed the Hanyang and Yichang garrison commanders to intercede, and also telegraphed the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce for assistance. Later, a telegram was received from the Wuhan Garrison Command, stating that it had already telegraphed your chamber in response. On the 23rd of this month, another communication was received from the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Upon receiving your telegram, which forwarded the Guangyi Bookstore's claims, our chamber presented them to the Wuhan Garrison Command for investigation and handling. A letter was received from the Staff Office of the Wuhan Garrison Command, respectfully replying that upon receiving a document submitted by your chamber, which forwarded a telegram from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce stating that the Yichang Guangyi Bookstore refused the consignment from the Shanghai Huatong Bookstore and immediately returned the original copies of reactionary books to Shanghai, which were intercepted in Hankou. The original sealed package of books returned via Hankou can serve as proof. We respectfully request permission to unseal the bookstore and release the people. We have already ordered the Postal Inspection Office to investigate whether the intercepted books were sent from Shanghai to Yichang or returned from Yichang, and to report back for further review. We are hereby informing you of this matter for your information." In response to this, we are hereby forwarding this letter to you and requesting that you forward it to the relevant parties.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Request for Improvement of Ash and Soot from the Flour Mill <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Over a hundred merchants and businesses in Caojiadu Town, including Yong Shengxin Hao, Fengtai Southern Goods Store, Dehe Silver Shop, Xieyu Kerosene Store, Hefeng Kerosene Company, Yifeng Pawnshop, Xiehexiang Foreign Goods Store, Fuchang, Shenda, and two Cigarette Paper Shops, have jointly submitted a petition. The petition states that the town center is a prosperous area, but the Xinji Flour Mill's machinery is running, creating a sound like thunder day and night. Coal ash flies everywhere, making the area extremely dirty. The merchants' goods are soiled, and the residents' health is greatly affected. Furthermore, the townspeople and employees cannot sleep peacefully at night. If this continues, it will not only harm public health but also disturb the peace of the residents. Yesterday, they jointly signed and sealed a petition to the Municipal Government, the Public Security Bureau, and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that the mill be ordered to make improvements as soon as possible to maintain the peace of the residents and emphasize hygiene. The text of the petition is recorded below: Petition for the noise and ash of the flour mill to be improved to avoid disturbance to the citizens' peace and health, etc. The Xinji Flour Mill is located in the center of the bustling Caojiadu area. Previously, when the mill was named Lida Flour Mill, it burned bituminous coal, and the ash was discharged from the basement. The machinery's noise was very low. Now, the mill has been renamed Xinji and reopened. The machinery uses diesel fuel, and when the engine starts, the sound is like thunder, and the houses shake. The noise can be heard far and wide. In addition, the ash and soot are not discharged from the basement but are emitted directly into the sky, flying everywhere. The surrounding residents and businesses are enveloped in smoke and smog, day and night. Hundreds of households and shops nearby cannot keep their homes clean during the day and cannot sleep peacefully at night. The laborers and residents are suffering unimaginable hardships. This matter involves public nuisance. Reluctantly, we have presented the true situation and jointly signed and sealed this petition. We earnestly request that you investigate and verify this matter and order the mill to make improvements to maintain the peace of the residents and emphasize public health. We await your instructions with utmost respect.</p>

<p>Encountered Bandits on the Way Back from a Funeral</p>
<p>Coachman Bleeding from a Head Wound</p>
<p>Everyone Forced Out of Ten Vehicles</p>
<p>Yang's Wife Immediately Abducted</p>
<p>At 9:45 last night, four bandits kidnapped Mrs. Ren, the wife of Yang Shuding, the manager of the first office of Jiaotong Bank, on the south side of Nanchengdu Road and Weihaiwei Road. They used guns to force Yang's daughter, a maid, a tutor, a coachman, and others out of the car, and then drove off in Yang's own automobile, license number 8995. The results of the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yang's Wife Attended Funeral of Eldest Brother</p>
<p>Yang Shuding of Jiaotong Bank lives at No. 30 Nikelu Road. His wife, Ren, is from Suzhou and is 32 years old. Yesterday was the 21st day after her husband's older brother's death. Ren, out of consideration for her husband's brother, personally took her eldest daughter, a maid, and a tutor, and ordered the coachman Ah Chun to drive her husband's own automobile, license number 995, to Yang's residence on Nanchengdu Road to attend the funeral.</p>
<p>Encountered Bandits on the Way Home</p>
<p>At 9:45 last night, Yang Ren, because the funeral ceremony at her elder brother's house had ended, ordered the coachman to prepare after dinner. She ordered her daughter, maid, and tutor to board the car, intending to go home to sleep. Unexpectedly, when the car reached the south side of Nanchengdu Road and Weihaiwei Road, four bandits suddenly appeared. Two of the bandits, armed with handguns, approached Yang Ren's car, ordered the coachman to stop the engine, and threatened him with guns.</p>
<p>Tutor's Soul Flew Out of His Body</p>
<p>At that time, Yang Ren, her daughter, and the maid sitting in the car were all women. They trembled with fear at the sight of the situation. The tutor, Mr. Someone, an old scholar, was also panicked by the situation. The coachman, Ah Chun, was still trying to turn on the engine and drive away. The bandits, without mercy, struck through the window with a gun butt. The glass shattered and flew everywhere, and the coachman's face was covered in blood as a result.</p>
<p>Four Bandits Kidnapped People and Took the Car</p>
<p>Seeing that the coachman could no longer resist, the bandits immediately opened the car door. Two bandits dragged out Yang's daughter and the maid. Two bandits used guns to order the coachman and the tutor to get out of the car. Everyone was faced with a dangerous situation. It was also drizzling lightly, the street lights were dim, and there was no way to call for help. They had no choice but to let the bandits do what they wanted. Seeing that their purpose had been achieved, the four bandits boarded the car. One of the bandits started the engine and drove the people and the car north.</p>
<p>Police Station Found No Trace</p>
<p>Yang's coachman and others saw their mistress being kidnapped and were unable to rescue her. They hired a streetcar and went to the Xinzha police station to report the incident. Upon hearing the news, the head of the police questioned the coachman about the situation and ordered the detectives to rush to the scene to investigate. He also informed all the police stations to assist in the search. The police stations in the Chinese and French Concessions were notified to pay attention to car number 8995. At the time of the reporter's writing, the car had not yet been found.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Da Xia Student Yuan Shunwu Abducted <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yuan Shunwu's cries for help were futile</p>
<p>A coughing rickshaw puller gets slapped</p>
<p>Yuan Shunwu, a sophomore majoring in commerce at Da Xia University on Zhongshan Road, finished his dinner at the Lu Zhong Western Restaurant opposite the school gate at around 6:30 PM yesterday. As he was walking back to school along Zhongshan Road, he was suddenly forced into a pre-arranged car by a group of kidnappers and driven north. Because the area falls under the jurisdiction of the Sixth District, the student union dispatched Shi Zhaoyuan to report Yuan Shunwu's abduction to the Sixth District General Office and request an investigation. Upon receiving the report, District Chief Ren immediately ordered all armed personnel and police stations to conduct separate investigations. As of 11 PM, there were still no leads. The details of the abduction are as follows:</p>
<p>The kidnappers hired a car. At 5:15 PM yesterday, two men, one wearing a white-gray long gown and the other a black long gown, both around 30 years old and speaking with a northern accent, rented a car from You Ning Car Company at the intersection of Xizang Road and Shantou Road. They identified themselves as surnamed Liu. The accountant signed a Chinese settlement certificate numbered 4417 and a concession certificate numbered 18055 for a Chevrolet sedan. The chauffeur, Zhu Xingtang, drove the car. The man in the black gown sat in the front, and the man in the white gown sat in the back. When the chauffeur asked where they were going, the kidnappers said they were going to Zhabei. As the car passed the northern end of the Xin Zha Bridge, the kidnappers ordered the car to stop. The man in the back got out of the car and ordered the chauffeur to drive to a quieter place on Gonghe Xin Road, where they stopped next to what appeared to be a guild hall. Three more men got into the car. Two were wearing long gowns, one black and one white-gray, and the other was wearing a black short outfit. After the three men got in, they ordered the car to drive to Caojiadu via Zhongshan Road. They ordered the car to stop intermittently. On the way back, two more men suddenly appeared, one in a white-gray long gown and the other in a short outfit. They pointed a pistol at the chauffeur and said, "Get out. Sorry, we need to borrow the car." After the chauffeur got out of the car, he was dragged by the two kidnappers to a grassy area in a nearby cemetery and guarded. The remaining kidnappers drove the car south.</p>
<p>The chauffeur was slapped. The chauffeur was dragged into the grassy area by the two kidnappers, who ordered him to sit down and forbade him from making any noise. The chauffeur coughed once because he was out of breath. One of the kidnappers immediately slapped him forcefully and said, "Don't you dare make a sound, understand?" After sitting quietly in the grassy area for about an hour, it started to drizzle. The kidnappers finally said, "You can go back now." The two kidnappers then strode off to the north. The chauffeur walked south along Zhongshan Road for about 20 minutes before reaching Da Xia University. He asked someone where the police station was and recounted what had happened. Only then did he learn that the men who borrowed the car had come to kidnap a Da Xia student. Someone hired a rickshaw to take him to the Sixth District General Office to report the incident.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Abduction: Yuan Shunwu walked out of the restaurant with two roommates (from Qunli Zhai, No. 237), Yu Deyuan and Chen Xianhe, side by side, chatting and laughing. Unexpectedly, as they walked along Zhongshan Road, they suddenly saw a car making a U-turn from south to north. The door was not closed. At the same time, someone holding a flashlight shone it in the faces of the three men. A kidnapper holding a pistol stepped forward and forced Yuan Shunwu into the car, which sped off to the north. When Yuan Shunwu was forced into the car, Chen and Yu were unable to rescue him. They only heard Yuan Shunwu shouting for help, but he seemed to have been gagged by the kidnappers, so they heard no further sound.</p>
<p>Yuan's Family Situation: According to Yuan Shunwu's fellow villager and classmate, Ye Yuan, Mr. Yuan is from Wuchang, Hubei. He is 19 years old this year and lives in Hankou. His father runs the Yuan Ruitai Construction Factory in Hankou. On the surface, it seems to be doing well, but in reality, it is not. Mr. Yuan is studying commerce and is currently in his second year. He has no family in Shanghai. This abduction may be a case of mistaken identity because Mr. Yuan is not actually qualified to be kidnapped. Furthermore, Mr. Yuan seems to suffer from neurasthenia. Yesterday afternoon, around 4 PM, he and Ye Yuan took the school's public car to Datong Road to consult a doctor.</p>
<p>Police Station's Vigorous Pursuit: After this incident occurred, the Da Xia Student Union dispatched student Shi Zhaoyuan, carrying a recent photo of Mr. Yuan, to report the incident to the Sixth District General Office and request a thorough investigation. At the same time, chauffeur Zhu Xingtang also went to the district to report the kidnappers' car rental. Upon receiving the report, Director Ren, considering the incident occurred within his jurisdiction and involved a staff member, immediately personally ordered Inspector Xu to lead the patrol squad and the entire detective team, fully armed, to search everywhere. He also ordered all police stations to pay attention and notified the Fourth District General Office, requesting them to order their subordinates to cooperate in the investigation. When the reporter arrived at the Sixth District General Office, Director Ren and Inspector Xu had already returned to the General Office and were studying investigation methods and deployment plans.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Water Patrol Captain Shelters Opium Traffickers Discovered <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Both People and Goods Seized</p>
<p>Escorted to the Local Court for Interrogation</p>
<p>Xu Yan, the acting captain of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Water Patrol Team, recently apprehended two opium traffickers, Shen and Zhou, as well as a boat owner named Zhou Fucheng, totaling 3,816 taels of opium, divided into five bundles. Xu Yan colluded with patrol police Jiang Shihe, detectives Ma Zhiyun, Zhang Longfa, and others to accept a bribe of 1,300 yuan, released the opium traffickers, and embezzled all the opium, hiding it under the deck of the Water Patrol Team's boat, intending to sell it for profit. Unexpectedly, someone informed on them. Director Yuan, greatly angered, cited the National Government's law that officials who embezzle more than 1,000 yuan are to be sentenced to death according to the law. Yet they dared to try this and even dared to embezzle opium, which is contrary to the anti-smoking law. Therefore, he immediately dispatched an inspector to arrest boat owner Zhou Fucheng. After questioning him and learning the truth and the location of the opium, the inspector rushed to the Water Patrol Team, searched out the stolen opium, and detained Xu Yan and Jiang Shihe. Ma Zhiyun and Zhang Longfa had already fled. Immediately, both people and goods were escorted to the bureau. Director Yuan interrogated them, and they all confessed. Yesterday, Director Yuan prepared official letters and sent police to escort Xu Yan, Jiang Shihe, and Zhou Fucheng to the local court at 4 PM, requesting a severe punishment. After the preliminary examination by the prosecutor, they were ordered to be detained pending further proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Thief Escapes While Handcuffed <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Xie Aofu cuts open the handcuffs for him</p>
<p>Caught in the act by a detective, punished</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, Wang Zitang, a native of Anhui, stole a small clock in the Chinese area of Zhabei. A police officer saw this and detained Wang in the Fourth District General Office of the Public Security Bureau. After interrogation, he was ordered to be sent to the Beggar Education Institute for training. The bailiff handcuffed Wang's hands and hired two rickshaws. Wang was in front, and the police were behind. While passing Gonghe Xin Road, Wang seized the opportunity to jump out of the rickshaw and run away. He disappeared immediately. The police officer could not catch up and had to return to the station to report and conduct a strict search. At 8:30 PM that evening, Wang entered North Shansi Road in the Public Concession and was seen by Xie Aofu, a native of Changzhou. Because his hands were handcuffed, he was questioned. Wang confessed the truth. Xie then borrowed a file from the Dexing Copper Shop, opened by Lin Xinyao, a Ningbo native, at No. 183 in a nearby alley, and used the file to cut off one of Wang's handcuffs at the back door of the shop. While he was cutting the second handcuff, he was seen by a colleague of Shang Wu, a Chinese detective of the Huishi Patrol Room. He reported to Detective Shang and went with a Western detective to arrest Wang Zitang and Xie Aofu. Together with the owner of the Dexing Copper Shop, Lin Xinyao, the handcuffs, and the file, they were taken to the patrol room for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court. Wang Yaotang, the patrol room's lawyer, stood up and presented the case, stating that Wang Zitang should be transferred to the Branch Security Bureau for interrogation. For Xie and Lin, the patrol room accused them of assisting in the escape and requested that they be punished according to the law. Detective Xu also testified that he witnessed the defendant Xie Aoxuan cutting off Wang's handcuffs with a file. However, the shop owner Lin Xinyao did not see it. Wang Zitang also confessed to how he escaped and Xie cut off his handcuffs. When Xie and Lin were questioned, their statements were evasive. After verifying the confession, Judge Wu Tingqi sentenced Xie to six months in prison, found Lin not guilty, and transferred Wang Zitang to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Municipal Bureau of Public Works Addresses Dangerous Old Houses <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>There are dilapidated and leaning houses everywhere in this city, especially in the Chinese area. Most of these old houses have rotten pillars and leaning walls, and danger can occur at any time. In recent years, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has repeatedly selected the most dangerous ones for rectification. Therefore, the dilapidated houses that used to catch our eyes in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas have now been gradually rebuilt, appearing cleaner. After the roads have been widened, traffic is also more convenient. However, generally, people do not believe the danger until the house collapses. When it really collapses, they complain. Therefore, enforcing rectification is not easy. It is said that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has always been cautious in addressing dangerous houses. Whether the report comes from citizens or the bureau's surveyors, they will send personnel to re-inspect and verify in detail before deciding on rectification. A photo is taken to record the situation before deciding on rectification, and then the owner is notified to dismantle the house based on the dangerous situation, to fulfill the responsibility of advising. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works recently submitted a list of dangerous old houses to the municipal government for demolition within a time limit (omitted).</p>
<h3 id="e211">Municipal Bureau of Public Works Prevents Impersonation of Surveying Engineers <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works recently issued a notice to citizens to pay attention to the discovery of unscrupulous individuals in the city who impersonate surveying engineers to swindle and deceive. In the future, if such incidents occur, they should report to the bureau at any time for thorough investigation. The original text of the announcement is as follows: It is hereby announced that recently, it has been heard that unscrupulous individuals have repeatedly impersonated surveying engineers of this bureau to swindle and extort money. Not only are citizens disturbed by them, but also the reputation of this bureau is affected, which is regrettable. All staff members of this bureau have been issued staff cards, which they carry with them. A photo of the staff member is affixed to the card, making it easy to identify. As for surveying engineers, because they are in charge of fieldwork, a shield-shaped survey card is issued in addition to the staff card to show solemnity and for identification. Citizens, if they encounter these surveying personnel, may check their credentials at any time. If they find that they are not wearing a survey card or have no staff card, or if they have a card but the person and photo do not match, they must be impersonating and can be arrested and prosecuted. Those who did not notice it beforehand and were deceived should also report the facts to this bureau afterward for investigation and punishment. However, most citizens are aware that they are willing to be fooled at the beginning when they encounter such incidents. When they discover that they have been deceived, they are afraid of causing trouble and are unwilling to come forward to report it, so that this bureau cannot see everything and remove this pest from society. This is regrettable. It should be known that the government and the citizens are one body. Without a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, the government, despite having the heart to eliminate evil, will be difficult to thoroughly clean up the mess. This announcement is made for everyone to know. In the future, when dealing with this bureau, be sure to come to the bureau in person and do not entrust it to others. If any deception still occurs, you must report the facts to the bureau at any time for thorough investigation. This bureau has high hopes for this.</p>

It is reported that the Water and Land Bureau has prepared to go together to suppress them.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Russian Rafalov Commits Suicide <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that at 1 PM yesterday, a Russian named Rafalov committed suicide with a gun inside Hexuecui Da Xia. Mr. Rafalov came to China three years ago, initially as a journalist. He was once associated with two White Russian newspapers in Shanghai. Later, he went to Harbin as a reporter for the news agency and editor of the Tianjin Russian Weekly. In May this year, he returned to Shanghai and left the journalistic profession. At about 1 PM yesterday afternoon, his wife entered the room and was shocked to see Mr. Rafalov lying stiffly in a pool of blood with a bullet hole in his forehead. Another Browning pistol was abandoned beside him. Before shooting himself, he had apparently taken poison first. His body was immediately taken to the American Funeral Home and will be buried today (24th). It is said that Mr. Rafalov belonged to the Trotsky faction of the Communist Party. Three years ago, when Trotsky fell out of favor and was forced to leave the country, his real name was Bobushkin. He has a sister, who is the wife of Rykov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union. Therefore, he was well-known among Russian expatriates. According to the Ta Mei Evening News, Mr. Rafalov committed suicide because he lost a lot of money in gambling.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Private Arms Trafficking Case Awaiting Further Interrogation <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, Chen Qingyuan, a native of Shantou, hid a large number of arms in the interlayer of kerosene tanks and the bottom of shoe baskets. He hired a small car to transport them to the Yihua Wharf on Yuanfang Road in Hongkou, intending to transport them to Shantou by boat for profit. Detective Ding Yugao and Western detective of the Hongkou Patrol Room learned of this and went to the wharf, arrested Chen, and took Zhou Zicheng, two kerosene tanks, and a shoe basket to the patrol room. Four pistols were found in the bottom of the shoe basket. The kerosene tanks were opened, filled with sesame oil, with interlayers on both sides. Six Mauser pistols, one pistol, 475 bullets, five bullet boxes, and a spring were found. According to Chen's confession, the arms were purchased from a certain Japanese at No. 121 Peng Road and Lin Xinrui, a Ningbo native at No. 912 Broadway Road. The detectives went to arrest the Japanese and Lin one after another, and also brought Wang Yun, a native of Haizhou, and Yu Shixian, a native of Qingkou, to the patrol room. The Japanese was transferred to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation. Chen and the other five people were detained separately pending escort to the Special District Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Further Interrogation of the Absurd Case of the Young Owner of Niupihao <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Zhu and Zhang Remanded Pending Sentencing</p>
<p>Xu Zide, the young owner of Shunxing Niupihao at No. 229 Diswei Road, was invited by Zhu Shunjin, a fellow trade native of Anhui, to visit the Wing On Company in June this year and fell in love with Zhang Naizhen, a local hostess. He successively used 1,968 yuan from the business. The case was reported by his father, Xu Yuhe, to the Hongkou Patrol Room, and detectives Chen Baozhong arrested Zhu and Ms. Zhang and escorted them to the Special District Court. Xu Zide was ordered to provide a shop guarantee that he would be available at any time, Zhang Naizhen was ordered to provide a 1,000 yuan shop guarantee, and Zhu Shunjin was remanded. The Wing On Company hostesses Afang and Aifeng were summoned to court to verify the situation, which has been reported in this newspaper. Ms. Zhang was detained in the women's prison without bail. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Attorney Li Zhishan of the patrol room stated that the change of date was in progress. The patrol room sent detectives to the Wing On Company playground to investigate the two hostesses Afang and Aifeng. According to the staff of the department, the two women had not been in service successively between the 12th and 16th of this month. Their home addresses are unknown. Now there are two hotel teahouse servants who came to court to testify, please inquire. Lin Shude, a teahouse servant at the New World Hotel, said that the defendant Xu Zide came in June, opened a room, a total of four times. Zhu Shunjin and a woman, Zhang Naizhen, arrived one after another each time. The second time, Xu, Zhu, Ms. Zhang, and another woman gathered in the room to play mahjong. Later, Xu and Ms. Zhang slept in the same room, and Zhu only stayed one night. As to the relationship between Xu and Ms. Zhang, I did not know because it was inconvenient to ask. However, all accommodation costs were paid by Xu, etc. Hu Huasheng, a teahouse servant at the Far East Hotel, also said that Xu Zide and Ms. Zhang came to open a room from the 2nd to the 15th of this month, a total of three times. Zhu was also there in the evening. Ms. Zhang and Xu stayed together for two nights. When questioned, Xu Zide confessed that I went to the Wing On Company and fell in love with Ms. Zhang. Zhu invited me to introduce her. The funds that were lost in the business were also instigated by Zhu. He successively gave Ms. Zhang money to buy clothes and lent Zhu 60 yuan. I and Ms. Zhang did go to the New World Hotel, the Far East Hotel, and the Central Hotel and slept together for several nights. Patrol Attorney Li then stood up and asked Xu, why did you not confess the words you confessed just now during the last court hearing? Xu said that when I was detained in the patrol room, Zhu threatened me and did not allow me to speak frankly, otherwise he would put me to death in the future, so I did not speak frankly. Zhu Shunjin firmly stated that Xu went to Wing On to play and opened rooms in various hotels, etc. were all done by Xu himself, not instigated by me. However, I borrowed 60 yuan from Xu, but I also used more than 200 yuan for traveling with Xu for several months, etc. When Zhang Naizhen was questioned, she said that Xu Zide came to the company to play tea three times, and gave me a gold watch. Later, she became close to hostess No. 3, Afang. What he said in court today deliberately framed me, etc. Judge Feng verified the confession, ordered the lawyers on both sides to debate, and then ordered Xu to return the original guarantee, and Zhu Shunjin and Zhang Naizhen were remanded to wait for a scheduled sentence.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Gu Aqings Implication Case Heard Yesterday <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Gu Aqing, also known as Gu Ziqing/Gu Cheng, was previously suspected of kidnapping and was detained by Chief Inspector Xie Shuiquan, Detective Ma Xiaozhi, and Detective Jin Guanya of the General Patrol Room and escorted to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. It is reported that the patrol room, in order to comply with the order of the court last time, should submit any evidence that is beneficial to the defendant within the period of change of date for nuclear debate at any time, so Gu was escorted to the First Criminal Court of Shi Te yesterday morning. Judge Sun Yuan and Prosecutor Xu Mei sat in the seat for questioning. Patrol Attorney Ru Baozhen said that during the period of change of date, evidence that was beneficial to Gu was found, but there are still suspicions. For the sake of fairness, the patrol room brought the defendant to court and ordered him to pay bail, but the minimum amount of bail is 10,000 yuan. If the court thinks it is still light, the bail can be increased again. There is one more point that should be noted, that is, the defendant previously claimed to be a shareholder of Daming Glasses Company. Now the patrol room has received a formal letter from Daming, denying that there is a Mr. Gu among the shareholders of the company. The patrol room has verified that the defendant opened the Shanghai Glasses Company in Dalian, which caused this misunderstanding. Yuan Yang'an, the defendant's lawyer, stated that the defendant really has nothing to do with this case and is a legitimate businessman who has invested a lot in the industrial sector. Shenzhou Hotel also has capital of 25,000 yuan. This time, he was really wronged and requested to be released. Even if he is suspected, please allow him to provide a common guarantee that he will be available at any time, because the defendant has a lot of assets and will never abscond. Attorney Ru replied that this is a serious kidnapping case, not a trivial case that can be compared to. If a common guarantee can be provided for a kidnapping case, then no guarantee will be required for other cases. After Judge Sun Yuan slightly questioned the defendant, he announced that the date of the trial is near, and if the defendant provides bail and goes out, it will hinder the patrol room's investigation. Therefore, the request for bail cannot be approved. The defendant was remanded.</p>

The prosecutor instructed that the two bodies should be collected and buried by Liu Yingzhou's father, but as of yesterday, they had not yet been buried. Therefore, Zhou Qifeng, the brother of the deceased, reported to the court again. The court ordered the local head to find Liu's father to arrange the burial, or else he would be prosecuted.</p>

<p>Sun Yuanlan, a 47-year-old man from Ningbo, works as a mechanic at the Yangshupu Tram Depot. Together with Wang Shifa (30 years old), a coppersmith from the same factory, he went to the home of a widowed woman surnamed Wu at No. 1, West Lane, Weixingli, Taopeng Road, to solicit prostitution the night before last. Two others were with them, one nicknamed "Gaoliang Bottle" and the other named Debiao, both unemployed vagrants. As the tenth round was about to end, Debiao had lost some money. Just as Sun dealt a card with two sixes and one, he called out "yao ding." Debiao then said "yao ding wants to eat," and a conflict arose between them in their speech, leading to a fight. They were separated by others, and agreed to meet at a tea house on Pingliang Road yesterday afternoon to talk things over. When the time came, Sun and Wang, not willing to be outdone, went on time. During the argument, Debiao insisted that Sun pay him twenty yuan to settle the matter, but Sun retorted. Debiao then gathered a crowd to attack Yuanlan with knives, cutting his right leg, causing profuse bleeding. They also used an iron ruler to injure Wang's back. When patrol officers No. 2430 arrived after hearing the news, the assailants had already disappeared. The two injured men were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The patrol officers reported to the head officer to apprehend the criminals for severe punishment.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Public Transit Company shipped seven pieces of hair from Hangzhou the day before yesterday. The freight car arrived at the South Station for unloading. Because the goods could not be stored in the warehouse, they could only be piled outside the station. That night, one piece, weighing more than fifty pounds, was stolen. The company reported to the guild, and a letter was sent to the railway police department, requesting them to send detectives to investigate and strictly apprehend the culprits.</p>

<p>Due to a love triangle dispute</p>
<p>The perpetrator has fled without a trace</p>
<p>Qian Fulian, a chauffeur from Wuxi, working for Deng Peizeng at No. 16, Dachongli, No. 246 Tongfu Road, is 27 years old. He usually arrives early and leaves late, and has been working for only a month. Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, chauffeur Fulin was having breakfast when suddenly a woman and a man came to Deng's back door looking for Fulin. At that time, the maid, Peng, happened to open the back door and, seeing that they were looking for Fulin, she turned around to inform him. Fulin, hearing the news, stopped eating and went outside. Unexpectedly, the visitors spoke to him in a harsh tone. First, there was a verbal argument, and then the man punched Fulin in the chest. Fulin immediately fought back, and the two began to fight. The man then pulled out a knife from his pocket and stabbed Fulin in the leg, penetrating deeply, causing a gush of blood. The woman, seeing this, became very alarmed and scolded the man for doing so, saying she would rather be stabbed to death instead. After speaking, she threw the knife into Yonglifang in the next alley, and tried to comfort Fulin. At that time, there was a lot of noise in Dachongli, and blood was everywhere. The assailant, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled without a trace in the confusion. Later, a patrol officer arrived and took the injured man to Baolong Hospital for treatment, and took the woman to the police station, where she will be interrogated today. According to a reporter's investigation, the woman who came with the assailant was Fulin's mistress. This time, because Fulin had rejected her, she had become acquainted with another man. Yesterday's visit was nothing more than an attempt to negotiate with Fulin, but unexpectedly it turned into this violent act.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Woman Petitions for Division of Inheritance <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Guibao, a local woman, is 29 years old. Her father, Zhu Yatou, passed away when she was only five years old, and her sister was still an infant. Her father left behind a considerable amount of property, such as the land where the Tiandechi Bathhouse is located on Rue Cardinal Fesch in the French Concession, and the land behind the Tiandechi old house, along with the houses and two adjacent plots of old house land, and fifteen Japanese-style houses on the land. Also, the Hongqiao Cemetery on Route Paul Beau, totaling more than ten mu of land and houses, is of considerable value, all of which has been occupied by her cousins Zhu Shengquan, Zhu Jinhua, and Zhu Kunhua. Although she has repeatedly asked Shengquan and others for a division, they have ignored her. Zhu Yatou, the father of Guibao, and Zhu Siyuan, the father of Zhu Shengquan, were brothers. All the property was jointly owned by the three siblings. Since the promulgation of the women's inheritance law by the National Government, Guibao has also asked relatives to ask Shengquan for a fair division (all the property is managed by Shengquan), but he has refused to reason. Therefore, Guibao had no choice but to hire lawyer Jin Yu to file a complaint with the court, arguing for the retroactive application of the women's inheritance law, demanding an equal division, in accordance with the law. The court has accepted the case and issued a summons.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Investigating Beef and Mutton Restaurants <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Preparing for Inspection and Crackdown</p>
<p>The beef, mutton, and pork sold by the meat shops in this city must be inspected by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's official doctors beforehand. The cattle, sheep, and pigs must be healthy before they can be sent to the public slaughterhouse for slaughter and stamping, and then sent to the meat shops for retail sale. The crackdown is quite strict. Now, the Health Bureau has found that the mutton sold by the religious halls (i.e., Muslim halls) and mutton restaurants in the city is not sent for inspection beforehand, nor is it slaughtered and stamped in the designated public slaughterhouse. Whether the quality of the meat sold is clean or not is a matter of hygiene. A letter has been sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordering each district to investigate the number of religious halls and mutton restaurants within its jurisdiction, to copy the names and addresses of the owners, and to reply to the bureau, so that personnel can be sent to inspect and strictly crack down on them, in order to emphasize hygiene.</p>

<p>Fei Qiu, a woman residing in a small room at No. 146 Caishi Street in the French Concession, reported to the French police the other day that her husband's younger sisters, namely the woman's nieces Fei Guirong, 18, and Fei Xiaomao, 17, had been living with the woman. Unexpectedly, the other day, Bao Jianrong, who lived on the third floor of the same building, and his wife, Zhu, colluded to entice the two young women to hide in the Dalu Restaurant in Sanmaoge Bridge, with improper intentions. She requested that the case be investigated. The police chief approved the request and immediately ordered detective Hang Guangfu to bring Bao and his wife, together with the two women, to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the French court for questioning. First, the plaintiff, Fei Qiu, complained about the circumstances of the abduction. Then, Fei Guirong and Fei Xiaomao both stated that the defendants had enticed the women to the hotel and held them in confinement, saying that the women had no way out living with their sister-in-law, and that they should follow them to Shanghai to work in a "swallow's nest" (brothel). If they were not good at it, they could go to other cities to work, where they could earn at least sixty or seventy yuan a month. Bao Jianrong and his wife both claimed that they were in the foreign goods business, but because business was slow, they had accumulated a lot of debt. So, with the help of friends, they opened a room in the Dalu Restaurant to gamble and skim profits, hoping to pay off their debts. As for the Guirong and Xiaomao sisters, they voluntarily went to the hotel to play with them, and their sister-in-law had agreed to it beforehand. They dared not engage in any illegal activities, and requested a clear investigation. Judge Zhu Cheng ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody, pending the police investigation to determine whether the plaintiff knew about it beforehand, before making a final decision.</p>

<p>Chen Zhaorong Arrested for Snatching Crabs</p>
<p>Shi Xueyi, a native of Tongzhou, residing at No. 15 Hubei Alley, Old Baidu, Pudong, is 35 years old and has always made a living by farming. A few days ago, Shi returned to his hometown on business. Yesterday, he took a boat back to Shanghai. As it was the season for fresh crabs, he bought a basket of large crabs, about eighty in total, in Tongzhou. At about 1:00 PM, the boat arrived at the wharf and docked at Wangjia Wharf in Nanshi. Shi carried the crab basket ashore and was about to hire a sampan to return to Pudong when Chen Zhaorong, a rickshaw puller from Nanjing, saw that Shi was a gullible country bumpkin. Because the crabs he was carrying were slightly larger than usual, he gathered several companions, stopped Shi, cut open the bamboo basket with a knife, reached in and took five or six large crabs, and turned to leave. Shi was angry that they had taken his crabs without asking, and stepped forward to scold them. Chen glared at him and said, "What's the big deal about me taking four or five of your crabs? You should know that you have to pay taxes for carrying crabs here. If you know what's good for you, give me forty cents, or else you can forget about going home to eat crabs." Then, Chen snatched the crab basket and had his companions take it away. Shi was anxious and immediately grabbed Chen and reported to Qian Dianjia, the guard at Post No. 15, who brought him to the First Precinct of the First District. He was ordered to stay temporarily, pending preliminary review and handling by the chief of the precinct.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Letters to the Editor <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read in the October 24th edition of your paper that in the case of Tang Yueqing enticing Luo Yuying, Luo Yuying had first gone to the Zhongfa Watch Shop upstairs on West Xinqiao Street in the French Concession to meet with a friend of Tang's. We have checked and the entire building above our shop is not subleased to others, and none of our employees know anyone named Tang Yueqing. As this concerns the reputation of our shop, we hope you will correct this matter.</p>
<p>Zhongfa Watch Shop, October 24th</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>The content of the news regarding the death of Yang Heshang and Mo Bu, published in your newspaper on October 23rd, involves me and is not in accordance with the facts. I am writing to request a correction to avoid confusion. My adopted son, Zhifu, was two months old when he was sent to my care by his biological father, Yang Heshang, and is now nineteen years old. In these nineteen years, I have paid for his upbringing, education, and engagement, at great expense. The Yang family has not paid a single cent. Since this year, the Yang family has intended to take Zhifu back to their family to continue their lineage. On September 14th, Yang Heshang and his wife, along with his brother Ruihua and his mother-in-law, Fan, invited me to discuss taking him back. The Yang family voluntarily offered 500 yuan as compensation for the expenses of raising, educating, and engaging him. The adopted son, Zhifu, was taken back by Yang Heshang and his wife, his brother, and Fan, that same evening at 7:00 PM. As for the compensation, not a single cent has been paid to date. I have never coerced or demanded payment. I am writing to briefly state the above, and I request that it be published in the Letters to the Editor column to make a correction. I rely on your public spirit.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Kang Jinbao, October 24th, to the editor of Shen Bao.</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai, staff members of the May 30th Family Association, and Xu Zhijian, a small businessman, and Luo Wenlang, a relative of a victim, had filed lawsuits against each other in the Special District Court for embezzlement, slander, and other charges. After several court hearings, it was discovered that the embezzler was someone else, and had no relationship to the parties involved in the mutual accusations. The three parties separately requested that the case be dismissed in court. Luo Wenlang's losses were compensated by Hu Changsheng, Xu Zhijian, and others from the Family Association. During the previous lawsuit, your newspaper and other newspapers published various details, which affected the reputation of Hu and Chen of the Family Association. Now that a settlement has been reached, Luo Wenlang and Xu Zhijian both feel apologetic towards Hu and Chen. I, the undersigned lawyer, am writing on behalf of Xu Zhijian to declare the previous situation to your newspaper, and I respectfully request that it be published in the Letters to the Editor column, in order to reveal the truth.</p>
<p>Sincerely, lawyer Li Shirui, October 24, year 19, to the reporters of the Shen Bao.</p>

<p>Puyi Real Estate Company announced that the October Real Estate Monthly compiled by the company has been published. In addition to reporting transactions in September, there is also an article entitled "Overseas Futures," which expresses the feelings of foreigners returning to this place from their home country, which is quite exciting. If you would like to read it, please ask for it from the company at No. 50 Nanjing Road, and it will be given to you immediately.</p>
<p>The Xinyue Silk and Satin Bureau on Shilu Road announced that since the opening of the bureau last month, business has been exceptionally prosperous. Because the bureau selects goods carefully, collects them richly, has novel patterns, and low prices, it has won the praise of ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life. Since the new opening, a month has passed in an instant, and there has not been a day when customers are not full, making it difficult to meet demand. In order to thank customers for their elegant intentions and to avoid regrets for those who have not yet had a chance to come, the autumn sale will continue for two weeks from today. The bureau has just received many new and strange patterns sent by special correspondents from Paris, the capital of France, and has already imitated them. They use the strengths of national silk and absorb the essence of European and Western material civilization, making them more tough and beautiful. These products will also be sold during the sale.</p>
<p>Daguanghang, No. 9 Hankou Road, announced that the self-reproducing copier recently invented by Mr. Song Zijiang, manager of this firm, is easy to use, the printing is clear, the decoration is beautiful, and the price is low. Now there are three sizes, small ones are only sold for four yuan each, and a bottle of exquisite ink is included. It is sold by the Commercial and Datong Bookstores.</p>
<p>Hefeng Leather Factory at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Rue Chapsal announced that the factory spared no expense to rehire superior technicians to finely craft new styles of leather suitcases and stylish handbags, which have long been popular in various ports, as well as in overseas Chinese areas in the North and South Seas. Although they have been working overnight to rush production recently, there is still a situation where they cannot meet demand. The owner of the factory, in view of the patriotic enthusiasm of the Chinese people, has specially sold the goods at cost price, only seeking to revitalize industry, regardless of the cost. They have also opened a separate door for sales, for people to visit and enjoy shopping, so business has been extremely prosperous in recent days.</p>
<p>Huatong Food Company on Weier Meng Road, Baxianqiao, announced that the company was the first to invent machine-made noodles in the early years of the Republic of China, which are divided into meat and vegetarian types. It can be called an old brand in Shanghai and the originator in the food industry. In recent years, they have rehired technicians with rich drug experience to develop almond lotus root powder, which quenches thirst and resolves phlegm, clears the heart and calms the liver, and its effect is miraculous. The lotus root powder from West Lake has been expanded in the workshop in Lujiawan and refined with great care, so it is popular in various ports. Compared with other companies, business is more prosperous. Due to the demands of various stores, new stoves have been built and motors have been installed to produce Chinese and Western biscuits. Special art painters have been invited to draw various trademarks, so although the production is strong, there is still a situation where the supply is insufficient.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Dance Hall News <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>The Rotary Club of Shanghai announced that the club held a dance party at the Great China Hotel last night to raise funds for the construction of a Russian children's school. There were more than 500 people seated, and gentlemen and merchants from various countries attended. During the opening, the national flags of more than ten countries including China, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan were successively hung up, indicating that this was an international goodwill. As for the lottery prizes, there were as many as 218 items, which shows that people in this city are happy to do good deeds.</p>
<p>The Yamato Dance Hall on North Sichuan Road announced that the costume dance held last Saturday was crowded with traffic and was extremely popular for a time. In order to make up for any negligence in the rush to entertain, everyone will be given a serving of Hot Dot, a unique delicacy in Shanghai, tonight to thank you for your kindness.</p>

<p>— Moye</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence</p>
<p>Westerners enjoy traveling for leisure, while Chinese people consider going out as a last resort. Getting on and off boats and cars is like desperately escaping for one's life, and being confined to a corner is no different from a prison life. The reporter, on a southward journey, took the Tianjin-Pukou train. The distance was only a thousand li, but it took a whole day and night. After being exhausted, my muscles and bones ached. Even after resting for a night, I still had not recovered. I heard that a passenger between Jinan and Pukou fell off the top of a train while crossing a steel bridge, resulting in shattered bones. I couldn't help but feel horrified. Fortunately, I haven't reached the point of having to climb on the top of the train. It has been ten days since the Jinan-Pukou line reopened, but second-class tickets have only been sold for two days. It is said that this is the result of Director Wang Duanting of the Tianjin Bureau's negotiations in Jinan. However, although there are second-class cars, there are actually only five private rooms. Deputy Director Zhu Lvyun of the Tianjin Bureau has already occupied one of them, and the rest are reserved for foreigners from the Yuzhong Lishunde Hotel and Chinese VIPs. The reporter wanted to buy a second-class ticket on a temporary basis, but was given a blank stare by the ticket seller, who said that he had to book a private room a day in advance and did not sell temporary single tickets. The reporter was angry and wanted to buy a third-class ticket, but in fact, the number of tickets had already exceeded the capacity of the car. Even if he wanted to buy a ticket, he would have to queue up behind more than a hundred hypocrites. Calculating that there were only half an hour left before the departure time, I was afraid that I would be rejected. So, I swallowed my anger and negotiated with the stationmaster. Fortunately, I was helped to find a seat outside the second-class car's bedroom, bought a second-class ticket, and squatted outside the bedroom door. I dared not lie down for long, nor could I sit upright. I bent over and crossed my legs, like a snail. It was truly an adventure.</p>
<p>The departure was originally scheduled for 7:30 AM, but the engine moved back and forth, and it was almost 8:00 AM. The villagers who had already bought tickets were all scrambling to the top. The long line of people behind, seeing that the ticket booth's small window was closed, were still unwilling to disperse, probably waiting to line up like this until the next morning. When the train passed Liangwangzhuang, driven by curiosity, the reporter climbed out of the crowd and went to visit the third-class car. Looking inside from outside the window, I could only see heads shaking. I couldn't tell how many there were. Many children were crying because they were squeezed, and it was difficult for women to even turn around while breastfeeding. The people sitting on top of the car were proudly congratulating themselves for catching the train, forgetting the bitter cold winds and rain in the evening.</p>
<p>The train stopped for a long time after passing Cangzhou. I took a stroll on the platform to get some fresh air. I saw the slogan "Spiritual Revolution" still visible on the wall of the station. I remembered that last year, when Jiang went north, the Jin army generals Fu Zuoyi, Li Shengda, and the former mayor Cui Tingxian accompanied He Chengjun on a special train to wait here. It has only been a year, and they have become public figures due to the rebellion. The prestige of famous generals has also disappeared like the turbid waters of the Fei River. I couldn't help but sigh at the vicissitudes of the world.</p>

<p>The train arrived in Dezhou, where ten thousand homes were lit up, and a strange scene of changing trains between the North and South was also being performed at this moment. It is necessary to record its inside story. Since the Jin army withdrew, the Jinpu Railway Bureau has been planning to restore traffic. The Southern Bureau first sent Deputy Director Zhu Lüyun to Tianjin to discuss the reception method. After understanding from all parties, the seal was received on the 3rd, and it was planned to restore the office. However, the next day, Qu Yucheng, the deputy director of the Tianjin Bureau, suddenly received an order from the Northeast authorities to be appointed as the director. As a result, the Southern Bureau's planned traffic plan was suspended. However, traffic is not only a necessity for the people, but also related to the income of the Railway Bureau itself. Therefore, the Northern Bureau sent Wang Duanting, the head of the vehicle affairs department, to Jinan to discuss the exchange of locomotives. Seeing the trains running in opposite directions, the income was settled separately by region. The detailed content is unknown. The general conditions are as follows: The No. 9 passenger and freight train from Tainan opened to Dezhou, and the original locomotive No. 107 returned to Tianjin as the No. 10 train locomotive. The No. 10 train locomotive then towed the No. 9 train back to Jinan. If the No. 9 train did not see the No. 10 train coming, it would stop in Dezhou and proceed after it had passed. The same was true if the No. 10 train arrived first. If the number of vehicles coming from the other side was less than the number of vehicles leaving, several vehicles to be leaving would be detached, ensuring that the number on both sides was equal. The Northern Bureau did not have second-class cars. For the convenience of passengers and public officials, the Southern Bureau lent one car. The income from tickets and freight was calculated and accounted for by both parties with Sangyuan on the border of Hebei Province as the boundary. The above are the main conditions for the Tianjin-Jinan line to be able to reach directly. When the reporter accompanied the train through Dezhou, he personally saw both parties clearly explain before they drove off in opposite directions. The only hardship was that the time when the trains from both sides met in Dezhou varied greatly, so the reporter's train stopped in Dezhou for as long as two hours. What was even more difficult was that the incoming train was short of three ticket cars. The stationmaster calculated that the numbers were incorrect, so he ordered the train the reporter was riding to detach three vehicles. As a result, the general public who were ignorant of the world and the ants in the car were in trouble. After those in the car got off, they could no longer enjoy the blessing of being crowded. They had to compete to "get on top". Those who were originally on top still got on top after getting off. Between getting on and off, moving luggage was frequent, and it was inconvenient to chase them away in the dark. So, with a sound, the train started. However, there were still many people left on the station. The station staff was still scolding, "Damn it, hurry up!" The train drove far away, and the sound of "leave, leave" could still be heard. The feeling of unhappiness was as painful as being stabbed in the heart with a knife. I had to curl up in the daze, hearing the sound of water dripping from the roof of the car. The waiter scolded loudly, but there was no way to stop it. According to the workers of the Railway Bureau, the Jinpu Railway Bureau has been unlucky since the Lincheng robbery. The directors in the middle have been changed several times, and Han Wenyu and Sun Ziven are the most guilty. Han created the precedent of deducting wages and owing salaries, and Sun used the evil habit of buying vacancies with money and falsely filling them. However, at that time, there were still five trains a day, two express trains directly to Pukou, and three distance trains. If calculated in opposite directions, there were ten trains on the way every day, not including the fifty blue steel cars. Now, the steel cars are stored in the Northeast and Shi Yousan's place, and the remaining trains are not enough for three. With these three trains, the whole line reaches directly, and it is still worried that it is not enough, let alone divided into two bureaus in the North and South, each acting on its own. The easiest business in the world to make money is the train, but in China, it has been losing money year after year, and foreign debts are difficult to repay. Although his words were painful, they were also true. This train should have arrived in Jinan at 8:00 pm that night, but as a result of "stopping at every station and stopping for a long time", it arrived at 4:00 am the next morning. In the daze, I was kicked awake by the waiter who was carrying luggage, and I felt sore all over. At the same time, I felt that my legs were no longer mine. I reluctantly stumbled off the train, as if in a dream. I heard someone from Kaifeng say that the Longhai Line from Xuzhou to Shanghai takes two nights and one day to reach, and stops at each station for one hour. The wheels of the train run like a mule cart. After listening to the words, I felt as if my brain had been poked with a small awl. (17th)</p>
