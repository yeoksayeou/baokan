<h3>中産階級</h3>
<p>法報述德國經濟狀况謂目下德國人民中有五分之四毫無分文資本。即受大學敎育者。亦有一百萬人收入借能維持其生活。如非重返中古時代貧困無依者由公家瞻養之制。則其將來。必僅剩三數銀行家與實業家爲富人。其餘悉成無産階級。此雖僅爲德國而言。然此種趨勢有進無已竊恐産業過量發展之國。皆將有此中産階級消滅之現象也。世界各國。除資本階級與無産階級外。以中産階級爲多。中産階級之人。賴經營中等之職業。藉各種中等之收入。以維持其生活。而社會亦即恃此多數中級之人調劑其盈虚。貫通其消息。互相依賴以均平發展然自此世界經濟衰落以後物價陡增。生活程度逐日提高。中等階級之人。當然先受其影響而所謂資本階級者。或以合理化等之方法。盡力擴充其大規模之工廠。或以龔斷操緃之手段。盡力經營其大規模之商業凡中等階級之營謀者。無不被其包羅中等階級之財力手段。旣不能與之相抗而各種支出銷費爲支持門面計。又不能稍减。入不敷出。勢必至於無從立足故今日之中産階級。處境最難。失業最多。此最可危之現象也。蓋世界斷無僅以資本無産兩阰階級立國者。若中産階級而至不能立足。則少數之資本階級恐亦不能巍然獨居於無産階級之上。如法報所謂將來僅剩三數銀行與實業家之富人。其餘悉成無産階級。决無是理也世之謀挽救經濟狀况者。當於中産階級注意之矣。</p>

<p>律師｜是的。請你即日將公費賜下。以資結束。</p>
<p>當事人｜大約一共要多少錢。</p>
<p>律師｜連談話費書信費出庭費等。一并在内。在約在一千兩左右。我和你的父親是老朋友决不多要你的。　　當事人｜呀。那是我的不幸。你怎麽不和我家先祖也是是老朋友呢。</p>

<p>酒徒｜不。這瓶酒是和我的朋友合買的。一人喝一半。</p>

<h3>馬君武金玉之言　晚·成·</h3>
<p>德國工學博士著名學者馬君武氏。本月下旬。在大夏大學紀念週演講「日本對於學術研究之精神。」蓋博士此次由日本游歷歸來。感懷頗深。金玉之言。不可以不記。（以下摘記片斷）</p>
<p>日人用最新方法生産。用最舊方法消費而華人則用十六世紀之生産舊方法。而用二十世紀之消費新方法。安得不民貧國弱哉。其唯一出路。國家對於學術研究上之設備。應努力求其擴充及獎勵。同時希望國人到圖書館實騐室去。</p>
<p>中國敎育。是文憑交易所。問學生何以要文憑。答吃飯娶老婆也。日本學生。大學畢業。尙多留校繼續研究。誠有求學之眞精神。此點君武將諄諄敎導中國學生。并有以挽救中國商業化之敎育也。</p>
<p>中國學生以西裝革履爲風頭。日本學生以樸實整潔爲光榮。前嘗有中國學生某在東京帝大留學。一日渾身芬郁。令人欲醉。進實騐室。被日本學生驅逐。對曰。「汝類游蕩子。不配研究學術。」一時傅爲笑柄是亦靑年棒喝也。蓋日本學生研究學術。孜孜兀兀。且有幾忘飲食者。中國學生。應以爲楷模焉。</p>
<h3>油製攝影一夕談　劍·泉·</h3>
<p>予素喜攝影。惟一知半解。苦無研究</p>
<p>機會。刻在華社四屆展覧會。見有油製之照片數幀。覺其光線色調等。敻異尋常。有非楮墨所可形容者。急欲一剖其疑。予因曩年客居北平。常見胡伯翔氏所作國畫山水走獸等大幅。筆墨高超。雄勁而有奇氣。逈非時流所可及。比來滬上。得友人之介。曾與胡氏有一面緣。爰往訪之。當蒙接見。時胡氏正就燈前作國畫猛虎圖。而朱壽仁氏亦適在座不。不禁喜出望外。蓋二氏在此次展覧會中。皆有油製照片出品。當蒙詳示頗未。因誌之如下。以供同好。（下爲二氏所言。）油製二字不甚妥貼。當謂之漠紙油色法。凡尋常之放大照片。皆可爲之。先以之放入漂白藥液中。將影像漂白。然後再定影冲晾乾。即可施納油之手續。納油之前。先浸入溫度約華氏七十度左右之淸水中。浸時之久暫。當視所用放大紙面膠質之軟硬而定。離水後平攤在潮濕之吸墨水紙上。用潔凈之濕手帕。吸去紙面之水分。即可以特製之筆。蘸油色於筆端以塗之。如須减去油色可另用一筆。輕輕跳擊以提去之。此種手術上之事。祇須勇於嘗試。任何人皆優爲之。其難能可貴之點。即對於景物能與以相當之增删。然其危險亦在此。作者如乏審美觀念。則其結果反致差悞百出。轉不如直接放大之爲愈也。攝影猶作書繪畫。非一用名紙名筆。即爲佳作。故攝影最要之基礎。仍在發揚美感。表現個性。其結構色調等。亦爲要點。若斤斤於一部份手續或在材料上着想。則雖登峯造極。亦僅照片工作中一尋常技師而已。方今攝影藝術。在國際上已甚普遍。各國展覧會。名家作品。多有用納油色法製成。法·意·等國。則更爲流行。國内同好。據吾等所知。有張珍侯。王世廉。郎靜山。高眉。沈誥。王大佛。郭錫麒。徐俊三。及舍弟伯洲等。對於此道。皆有深切之研研。此乃國内攝影界興趣日漸濃厚之明徵也。</p>
<h3>川中雜記　胡·天·農·寄·自·四·川</h3>
<p>自譚延闓氏逝世後。川中軍政界皆有熱烈之哀弔久伏川中之吳佩孚。亦慨然書一聯寄往中央。上欵爲組庵老弟千古。下欵則赫然如兄吳佩孚也。聨曰「蜀道艱難。巫峽啼猿數行涙。長沙痛哭。衡陽歸雁幾封書。」情見乎詞。吳殆今之傷心人歟。</p>
<p>又此間楊森軍長。兵駐渠縣爲狀亦極消極。無聯時偶爾詠詩。亦頗哀感。詩曰。風雨催秋早。戎裘感歲華。我軍窮到骨。久駐恐成家出塞思飛雁。揮毫類老鴉。偶然樓上立。且看幕烟斜。</p>
<h3>梅花歌舞記　政·</h3>
<p>梅花少女歌舞圑。前由圑長魏縈波之領導。赴長江上游各埠。一試新聲。所至聲譽之隆。得未曾有。近在南京路市政廳開演。賣座甚盛。一昨稍暇。得以一飽眼福。擇記一二。以爲讀者告。</p>
<p>柔若無骨。優秀舞「將死之鵝。」表情極難。該圑中之張綺女士。獨擅勝塲。最難能者。即婀娜中得矯健。俯仰左右。柔若無骨。能以一足舉與首齋。又能以首後俯及地。凡此種種。均臻化境矣。</p>
<p>花圑錦簇此舞參加者凡十二人。爲純粹之西洋作風。由西人克拉林氏指導。一舉一動。皆極美艶之能事。就中尤以錢。鍾秀爲最特色。其舞姿之美。堪稱獨步。論者咸謂花圑錦簇一舞。爲該圑最大之成功。</p>
<p>長記得長記得爲一　歌。而中含哀怨之意。歌曲不難。傳情則大非易事。昔日明暉之得名。即基於此。是日該曲由張仙琳淸唱。不雜舞蹈。反饒靜趣。其聲調激越處如壯士出征。雷霆奮發。悲哀處如午夜鵑啼。感人至深。洵傑才也。</p>
<p>小小畫家小小畫家。爲近來舞壇名劇。該圑由龔秋霞飾畫家。天眞未鑿之狀態。發揮靡遺。敎師中之蔡問津楊震彪尤爲滑稽。終塲彩聲不絶。</p>
<p>慶祝新年此次開演於市政廳。迄已旬日。聞自二十至二十七日共售七八千元。上座不弱。會期本止於二十九號。二十四日。諸重要職員。乃决議續演五天。至二十年三日爲止。臨時排定節目。自廿九至年終。演「月明之夜」「春天的快樂」以及新歌舞十種。元旦至三日則以各界之請求。復演「七情。」蕪湖明星戲院。自元旦起亦聘梅花圑登台。不得已。乃抽最近招致於歌舞稍具根柢之圑員。輔以老圑員三數人。以允蕪湖之約。是以所表演者。祗能在「小三蝴蝶」等劇範圍之内一面滬上仍演「七情」「　李艶桃」等大歌舞劇。聞共和影戲院自十日起。亦由梅圑假座表演「七情」等節目。以應南市愛觀歌舞者之請求。「七情」魔力。竟至如是。吾知是戲編者縈波女士及蔡問津君。當爲之欣慰不置矣</p>
<p>短訉郭君效靑李君道熙倪君秋萍皆爲海上胡琴名手。造詣宏博。一時有四大金剛之譽。近者三君有中華國音社之設。特聘北平製琴專家專製名種樂器。以供同好。而李君對於選擇琴料。及配合之道。尤爲精細。一若平中之楊寳忠。刻聞已定於下月初旬開幕。欲得精美樂器者幸希注意。社址設在英租界四馬路跑馬廳中央。在菜社樓下。（琴迷）</p>
<h3>心上温韾（三四六）　包天笑</h3>
<p>第十六回殷勤問字翠袖謁先生慷慨談兵靑樓宴女傑</p>
<p>誰知那請客的人回來以後。便在樓下喊道。請客就來。旣然説到請客就來。伊自然是肯來的了。一時座客皆正襟危坐。心待這位中德女豪傑的光臨。隔不到十五分鐘。只聽得樓梯上一陣皮鞋　　之聲。便走上一個人來。便問綠漪的房間在那裏。房間裏的人連忙喊道。在此地。在此地。那位客人便大踏步而入。却見伊身上穿了一件寳藍色鐵機緞的男式袍子。雖然時下漸漸流行了一種女子所穿的旗袍。那種旗袍。在下幅是不開叉的。還有時髦的人。把旗袍做的很短。不過剛過膝三四寸的。只是有許多人。却反對穿旗袍。爲的是辛亥革命。反對了滿淸政府。把他推翻了。多少帶着一點兒種族革命。以異族入主中夏。漢族的人心不平。抑鬱已久。這一次要發洩一下了。因此要把滿洲制度。盡行推翻。但是在女人所穿的旗袍。豈不還是滿洲制度嗎。那末我們堂堂漢族。何必要學他呢。所以那時候穿旗袍還没有盛行。女人們都是短束裙。可是像今天的那位任佩眞。伊是不肯自命尋常女子。伊要和男子一樣。伊也穿了男子的長袍。外面却也不加上什麽馬褂之類。這時候。女子穿男子衣服。倒也很爲時髦。就像綠漪也是常常穿男子衣服的。伊身體本來還嬌小。穿了男子的長袍。外面還罩了一件背心。四周鑲嵌了什麽如意頭。頭上戴了一頂西式的便帽。倒也見得丰致翩翩。也不但是綠漪。有許多堂子的倌人。都這様的打</p>
<p>扮。但是任佩眞雖然穿了男子的長袍。却没戴那種西式的但帽。還是梳了一個髻。就伊這個髮髻上看來。確也有些兒特異之點。原來在辛亥革命的當見。一般有志婦女。也有一些兒革命精神。那個革命精神。便先髮髻。梳在頭頸在前淸之季。婦女的那種髮髻。的確有點兒不像樣子。有一種髮髻。梳在頭頸裏。他們以爲有媚態。像古時節的所謂堕馬髻一般。有人説那種髮髻。有些兒妖形怪狀。還有那種稱之爲風凉髻。散心髻。義取簡便。不過一挽了事。可是稍不留心。頭髮便披了下來。那年革命時代。婦女們便流行了一種朝前髻。把頭髮梳在額角。也有的把頭髮梳在頭頂心上。當時有人又稱爲相打髻。意思便是説。憑你給人家相打。頭髮也不會散下來。</p>
<h3>南洋游記　（一一六）　·花·</h3>
<p>印緬人多食酸辛。如葱　之類。而檳榔尤普及。</p>
<p>緬人大部分生計。彙米之出口。但今英人限制出口。云維持貧民生計。華人或日。非也。此乃絶緬人之財源。恐其富面活動。不利於英也。米出口之。一切財源滯而不鑿。亦商業不振之一因。又因金貴成本厚。米出口價昻而難售。土人因之受虧。中人在緬營機器碾米者多。名曰米較云。其貲本數十萬百萬不等。</p>
<p>南洋各島。因地而氣候不同。各不相知。以緬甸論。蓋有三季。以古歷計。由四月至九月爲雨季頗宜衛生。由十月至十二月爲冬季。無雨而温。微寒。爲最適宜之工作時代。一切工商業皆盛於此時。正月至三月極熱。又無雨。爲夏季。乃最不適之季也。緬甸三季略如此。至平常稱雨季者但指有雨無雨言之耳</p>
<p>余主國際開放合作。以異種通婚爲中心。因一切問題。生理爲第一。生理血統同化。餘事自異昔南海康氏招贅婿爲一貧士。曰此亦共産之調制法也。由此可推之矣。友人因告余。君主國際通婚。以和萬國。今各僑在南洋者。閩粤人因語言關係。通婚尙少。然則爲閩粤調和計。亦應多提倡閩粤互婚。乃結合大圑體之一法也</p>
<p>南洋爲雜色種人所生。此處雜色種之意。乃是表歡迎之意。與中土常用以爲詬病者正相反。余見多有緬女與西人結婚而生之子女。英語甚嫻。貧者亦不少。殆父死而流落者與。緬女智而優美。故各國人往往娶之。緬女之態度。殆較日本女子爲優。緬人俗愛美。即鄉下勞動男工人。亦着紅衫。滿於稻田中。無襤縷汚穢。若我淮河以北人者。文秀過之遠矣。各人門上。多置花盆。殊雅潔。意坤化母化大行時。人皆知愛美。而雄性暴戾之氣。可日銷减乎。吾將以緬俗卜之也。若緬甸者殆可稱花國。而我中華何反不如。淮以南尙可。而北方何其退化耶。</p>

<p>晨間已開高盤晨六月份開盤六百六十四兩六錢計加一兩一錢（毛盤在六十五兩前後、交易尙屬不怠）大條無市銀價不更、惟私電（二十八日）已小去十六分之一、匯率不更、繼因散户等售出、大連帮亦稍脫手、即回至六十三兩五錢未幾大德成·志豐永·協裕等來進已回高三兩惟有一兩之上落迨先令揭佈、掛牌勿動時爲六十六兩七八錢、内盤見挺、中行朝鮮互做英金一五二五、華比吸現大連一兩四錢一分八七五、且太康潤等買進、當又漲爲八兩四錢、元亨·志豐永等前來脫售回去一兩餘、九點五十分時七兩、三月花旗由掮客售出三十四元八七五、旣而華義·三井出三十四元八一二五、市况轉緊、並由太康潤·協裕·物品等追進、英金一五二五難結、故十點一刻高至六十八兩七錢往後同泰昌·福昌·元亨及套頭等俱有售出乃價漸入衰弱之境、然時有一兩餘盤旋、直至十一點一刻、僅計六十四兩六錢、場内買者不爽、人心似低、倐忽又向上升乃住友吸四月英金一五二五、又現大連以一兩四錢一分七五可賣、兼之志豐永·元茂永等皆已購進、故十一點五十餘分爲六十七兩四錢、午刻收市復退至六兩四錢、因元亨並散户售出、實緣市况飄泊未定、一賣即低也、揭價仍計六百九十一兩二錢、計二十四兩餘、至二十三兩午後二十五兩左右、</p>
<p>後市益覺鋒俏後市開盤六十六兩七錢、（毛盤六兩三四錢至七兩光景）、旋因印滙電訉已小去四安那、故漲爲六十七二錢、往後互有一兩軒輊、二點半後零户售出、且三月英金可結一五二五、逐已遜去一兩、至三點二十餘分計六十六兩一錢、嗣後突呈高象三井等吸現大連一兩四錢一分八七五、又三月英金有利吸一五二五、良田大德成·物品并恒豐上場拖進、乃市面頓見鋒利三點五十餘分爲六十八兩二錢、此時元亨等售出當抑去一兩、四點後復見良好氣象、三月英金僅結一五一八七五、銀行心思頗堅恒興繼續購進、一跳二兩、迨四點三十分收市爲六十八兩九錢、比較上週六計漲五兩四錢、誠小跌大回、入後再行　高二兩、竟然超出七十兩大關、物品買進不少、純屬套頭性質也、曾到過七十一兩、誠出意外焉、查一日間最大六十八兩九錢、最小六十三兩五、計有五兩四錢上落、（係照掛牌）凡六十九兩二錢以上之價、交易所不收塲賬、祗得各號自理、物品早市四兩半、午收六兩三錢、下午六兩八錢、收市七十一兩、揭價計抑小二十四兩餘至二十三兩内、登賬六十三兩、至六十六兩、補水六十三兩、下午六十六兩、</p>
<p>交易仍無鉅量同行交易、計太康潤·永亨·永豐·元茂永·協裕均進、大德成·志豐永·源太萬興·順利出入不等、元亨·裕豐永·福昌均出物品進而復出、下午裕豐永·元亨·餘大·元茂永均出、大德成·恒興·物品·萬興均進、志豐永·順利時有出入、永亨·永豐則稍購進、但各號都無大批交易、實因新年將屆、大致軋平、大連帮共出七八百條、買進亦然七八百條廣帮共買四五百條云、</p>
<h3>外匯晨平午緊</h3>
<p>昨英美印銀市無電匯豐掛牌各滙均無變動、惟内盤初平後鋒、午後尤緊、殆金市復呈高象、已漲上五六兩竟知重見七十兩以上之高價於是市氣頓開進展之象、迨午後收市比較上週六計英金縮零六二五、美金縮一八七五、日金漲七五、華商金業中似欲扒結、然銀行不肯輕售曾成交英金十萬鎊、住友三井等俱有出納、又各行互做數萬鎊又美金扒進五六十萬元、銀行如三井華義大通及盤根等咸有售出、而日金茲由大連帮抛出一百餘萬元、現大連因市價比較大連埠爲高、殆三井華比住友朝鮮等均有吃進、又下午朝鮮曾做出一月份日美滙兌計四十九元六</p>
<p>二五</p>
<p>英滙内盤計有零六二五高低、上午近遠期出價一先令五便士二五、買進三一二五、午收平定、下午收市也價一八七五、買價五五、</p>
<p>美匯内盤計有一二五升降、上午近遠期出價三十四元九三七五、買價三十五元○六二五、收市出價三十四元八一二五買價九三七五　　美滙内盤終日計有七五差次、早市一月份出價一兩四錢一分八七五、三月一分七五買價减三七五至半分、午收出價一兩四錢二分二五、三月二分一二五、下午收市正月出價一兩四錢二分半、三月二分三七五、買價約减半分、</p>
<h3>開關日銀錢業收解浩繁</h3>
<p>更値年底格外加多</p>
<p>準欵證劵交割亦繁</p>
<p>市場概况昨爲星期一以前數天封關各釐手續均須昨日疏理、故情形特殊、奉今年年關結賬還欵分兩期舉行、否則更爲難堪、且每月常例之證劵交割亦須於昨日舉行、因而銀洋兩種收解及交易爲從來未有之忙碌、職是之故、轉致所有消息、以未便調查及時間關係、反不能如願詳細報告爲可憾耳</p>
<p>厘拆價格（洋厘）早市厘價爲七錢二分四厘八毫七忽半、午市忽然改昻六毫二忽半、爲七錢二分五厘半、結果較前日午市如漲半厘、（銀拆）早市八分、午市相同、較前日似好二三分劃頭仍無加水而做白劃、</p>
<p>輔幣市情江南小洋早市做出六錢五分七厘午市同價做出交易早市三千角、午市無交易、廣東小洋早市爲六錢五分八厘七毫半、午市爲六錢五分九厘、較前日似小半厘之譜做出</p>
<p>交易早市十二萬五千角、午市五萬五千角、銅元回縮二千文、爲三百六十八千文、</p>
<p>銀洋進了出昨市銀洋收解、無論銀行錢莊</p>
<p>各種常例手續、以事務過多、時間上必須延長、故屬稿時都半未曾核計未能詳細報告、據業中推測之估量、其銀公單收解至少在五千萬以上、洋公單收解亦在一二千萬間、而銀行之結欵收解更繁、大約在六七百萬以上、惟聞各路匯欵收解八十餘萬云、市場中做開匯劃票欵早市有四百○一萬五千、午市亦有二百七十六萬九千、兩市交易竟有六百七八十萬之巨、亦特殊繁多之事、實緣昨日値證劵交易本月份交割之期、此次交割額、確較平時加多一倍以上、故而有此現象、鈔票場内均無交易、場外早市二十二萬四千、午市十一萬、銀行交易、早市互市一百三十萬、午市互市八十五萬、各銀行洋户往來概須歸束、收解當然寥落、然旣未能全部份收解額詳細調查而此種附帶收解、自亦不能查考矣、</p>
<h3>證劵　昨日公債交割情形</h3>

<h3>紗花　本月紗交割情况</h3>
<p>及其全部市程的過去</p>
<p>十二月份標鈔在月初形勢頗呈不穩、蓋大勢情形衰弱、現紗銷路岑寂底貨日增、市盤日趨下游、而某廠商手中呆貨七八千包因力量不足、勢難支持大有摇動狀態、後以空頭悉數購進在市套出一時市氣驟虚、賣風較熾、各月發現新低價、由一百四十二三兩跌至一百三十五兩五錢、未幾年終結賬問題、可以轉緩一個半月於是實銷漸有生氣、價格轉硬再以出廠税事甚　　上、商場上議論紛紜、市况日見緊張嗣以出廠税一月一日實行、客帮遂有大批交易發展形勢汹湧且各帮均催逼現貨、趕速裝運、在一號以前逹至地頭可免去税餉銀六七兩之巨、因</p>
<p>此生意異常踴躍、人心激動、買氣旺盛、且錢莊帮購進套利、一般羣爭做多、因此漲風愈趨愈烈、最高曾到一百四十五兩一錢結果交割價一百四十三兩交割數共計八千八百包自行交割四千一百包實行交割四千七百包計二十支五福一千四百五十包牧羊一千七百五十包、十支地球六百包十支三羊三百包、收貨散户爲多數、茲將收交兩方牌名及包額錄左、</p>

<h3>本月花交割始末</h3>
<p>交價三十三兩半：：數量三萬六千一百担</p>
<p>收貨者多頭公司：：交方漢帮及一般散户</p>
<p>十二月份標花在月初情勢平疲、蓋以世界棉業狀况仍在衰弱中、買户缺乏、現棉交易岑寂各廠印棉吸飽、需要完全停頓、多數心理抛空、然買方因標準今定頂高、市上存貨尖貨較缺、漢帮亦似多頭、來源不旺、查賣空散户爲多數因此買方轉空、意態堅决、且月宋幾日適値封關貨品不及檢查、軋勢愈激、月初在三十一兩七八錢、最低三十一兩三錢半、最高曾到三十五兩、超過市上現貨價三兩以外、此種情形、爲所罕見、故一月份上日標準發生風潮、要求所中重行審查、標準相持二三小時始開拍、結果交割價爲三十三兩五錢交割數共計三萬六千一百担、貨品陜西火機、收貨多頭公司、交貨漢帮及散户、茲將收交兩方經紀牌號分誌於後、</p>

<h3>現紗消費力强</h3>
<p>純然是爲了免税關係</p>
<p>紗銷數一七零零包標紗因月底辦理交割事宜、停止集會一日、但商場上人氣依然堅挺、現紗銷路仍暢客帮辦意仍濃、故人心穩固、多數帮口均催裝現紗、趕速運往地頭、可免税餉、如出廠税能緩期、現貨尙有大批發展希望、如反</p>
<p>之暫時或定、總之市面一時難以看跌、查全日各帮買去統計一千七百包、午後亦有五六百包交易、尚未記載、客帮中四川進三百二十五包、寗波帮進四十五包、汕頭進一百五十包、廣東帮進一百七十五包蘆州進五十五包、徐州進七十包、内地進四百二十包、漢口進二百五十五包、蕪湖進五十包雜帮進一百三十包、行情與上日相仿云、</p>
<p>棉去胃難破呆滯局期棉因月末交割停市</p>

<h3>糧食　米市轉呈平定</h3>
<p>閘北昨日各帮到源二十號之譜市銷不一、白粳買氣轉淡、高貨殊鮮上落、中次稍有出入、大勢因來源仍未疏通不易下游、故市價一致平定也、薄稻到銷兩淡、價守原盤、羊杜秈高貨因稀見俏、中關銷呆沉寂大盤氣甚上落、埠尖市懈勉平、變元缺高吊胃不爽、價告萎弱、陰元高貨平穩、普通呆而少交、特别白元當在十三元三四角也、</p>
<p>滬南昨日河下到船仍稀本街走銷不甚</p>
<p>爽快白粳晨間因承上日之餘風而步緊、繼接北訊告平而趨定故常錫兩帮見穩蘇同粳零銷欠佳市略下降、南路薄稻早稻到銷兩懈、存底充厚、市價站定、羊杜兩尖到接去平行情微堅高貨在十二元開左、變陰元吊坊又見活動、但價則不易喊高也</p>
<h3>日米允准在滬出售説</h3>
<p>客秈到銷兩振</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况形居定勢、到頭不多、本街續</p>
<p>有去化雖客帮停頓已久、而市上存到兩少、祗敷本街一路問津、故市面乃得立定也、昨日仍由本街辦去江西機早一千包、價十元零六角半至十元零三角、湖南機油二百包、價十一元三角半至十三元三角又　紅米五百包、價九元四角七分、又機靖米二百包價十一元一角半、行情均與前市相近云、</p>
<p>月前到申之日本米因他種關係、迄今未有售脫、昨據某方消息、該米今明即可在市出售、因市當局已奉南京命令、准予在滬出售、故今明日</p>
<p>必可見市也、</p>
<h3>閘北貨黑瓜子閩銷暢旺</h3>
<p>黑瓜子自市價回振以來、閩銷　常活潑、前後</p>
<p>已辦去萬餘包、價自十兩零至十一兩不一、因此</p>
<p>市勢繼續趨漲、如碭山子前盤開過十兩零半者、現號家喊十一兩、大連子地價升至十一元三四</p>
<p>角、劃申不合、來源乏到、昨市行盤上檔如濟中子呌售十二兩七八錢、徐魁子十兩半、碭山子十一兩、以次自十兩至九兩半、市象穩秀</p>
<h3>海味堆翅産歉價昻</h3>
<p>甬小翅價貴銷呆</p>
<p>堆翅産地原料缺乏、致出貨銳减、市價暴漲、且遇客帮需要、時有斷貨供市之虞、輪由港運到各檔十三箱、昨號盤開售三福印龍鬚堆價七百十五兩、雙福印六百六十八兩、金山頂堆四百六十六兩大堆三百八十四兩、中堆三百二十兩、比較上旬市盤、各檔又漲二三十兩、况行方進胃甚濃、後盤或有再升之勢、</p>
<p>小魚翅日本貨因滙水高漲、成本划大、故久少到貨、國産寗波翅、今庚收獲頗豐、惟市價高昻客銷不免轉滯、刻售全尾原干翅一百三十五兩、全副翅九十二兩、至八十五兩、惟漢帮去化尙稱健旺、</p>
<h3>絲茶英莊動辦廠經</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、英銷漸趨發動、緣怡和上週三談判之中身白廠經交易、因耶節休假、始於</p>
<p>昨日上午談成、共計成交中身貨一百六十包、價祗扯八百兩各廠商因價小不願宣佈絲牌、信孚進上身灰經三十包、價亦不振云、</p>
<h3>俄莊開辦紅綠茶</h3>
<p>旅滬俄國協助會洋行昨日對於祁門紅茶、及貢熙綠茶、又復開始搜辦、惟是上項紅綠茶、存底不過一二萬箱、在此金價高昻之秋、各國茶價太貴、華茶市價獨廉、俄人多駇購華茶、認爲得策、但昨市俄莊對於祁茶、認盤不過三十兩左右、較華商願望、相差不下十餘兩、談判尙未能接近、貢熙綠茶、今日亦可進行談價、惟紅綠茶商、深悉俄莊銷胃之浩大、一致堅决表示、不願讓價求售云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　各貨走銷奇暢</h3>
<p>本廠市昨一致上漲且來勢甚猛、實以出　廠税實行在即、兼之陽歷年關須休息數天、一時</p>
<p>間不能出貨、故本客需要奇暢、細布昨復成交四五百件、價又漲五分至一錢、陽鶴爲六兩八錢半、彩球六兩八錢、藍雙魚六兩八錢二分半、藍鷄亦已六兩六錢半、細斜·陽鶴又須七兩、藍雙魚六兩八錢半、粗布除本街墊進外、軍需去路甚暢、十三磅雙馬·馬狗、一致斷檔、祗雙英已開六兩、十一磅三兎·三鹿·三猫均四兩七錢半、粗斜亦挺、十六磅五元寳爲七兩六錢二分半、十四磅人塔無貨、三魚售五兩二錢二分半云、</p>
<p>東西疋各市莫不猛漲、本客需要之殷、爲今庚所僅見、良以進口税已定於一月一日增加、兼之金市漲風未已、嗣後貨價定必飛漲、故走銷奇暢、東貨存底、大有一空之勢、本街同業、每家俱有一二百件出貨、客帮方面、四川·漢口·靑</p>
<p>島·開封等帮、採辦亦　續不絶、致價飛漲、昨直貢呢漲五厘、獵雁　　　三錢四分七厘半、莫干山三錢四分一品富貴三錢二分半、長板橋仍無現貨、月華絨所到之湖心亭一百件、龍虎二百件、至昨已完全售罄、細嗶嘰亦頻漲不已、各牌</p>
<p>俱高二厘半至五厘、西貨亦挺、漂布漲二錢至三錢、元羽綢漲五錢左右云、</p>
<h3>開水美雨布突漲一錢</h3>
<p>單面開水美雨衣布、昨日市銷復暢、買方需要又殷、售盤因之繼續突漲一錢、蓋申地存貨缺乏今經再行搜羅、更覺軋缺、昨躉批毎碼須售四兩一錢半門莊裁縫零剪計洋六元二角、欲售元色灰色者、雖再加角許亦難覓得、實因存貨漸已售罄之故、查下月份雖有到貨、但開價必更貴、蓋洋行定出逹六先令四便士之鉅爲同業所共曉、若以匯禁票結算、其成本尙不敷也</p>
<h3>五金白鉛皮行情漸佳</h3>
<p>白鉛皮邇因貨少、各帮點綴甚夥、因此布勢亦有漸入佳境、如二號估二十六兩、三號二十五兩五錢、四號一十四兩七錢半、五號二十三兩五錢、六號二十二兩五錢、七號八號二十二兩、九號二十三兩、十號在二兩、但近來外滙奇小、人心高低不一、故標準高低亦有五錢至一兩不等、聞昨日開出二十餘桶、購去者爲茶棧帮云、</p>
<h3>小分釘價漲二錢半</h3>
<p>小分釘近因到少交旺、致市上存貨、有供不敷求、兼之外匯暴跌、人心更固是以行情又漲二錢半、計三分售十二兩五錢、四五分十一兩、六分九兩二錢半、聞昨日開出有一百六七十桶之多云、</p>
<h3>雜訉湖絲四百二十件今日運英</h3>

<h3>司法院解釋租賃關係</h3>
<p>關於改造房屋問題</p>
<p>近年以來、關於本市租賃問題、房東與房客間、時起糾紛、往往發生壓迫勒遷情事、房東方面、則以産權所在、不容退讓、結果、則往往成爲社會的法律問題、茲據新聲社京訊、最近司法院、於十九年十二月二十三日、以院字第一一七七號、指令江蘇高等法院、呈請解釋租賃房屋自行出資翻造、因未設定期間、能否令其隨時遷讓一案、對於本市租賃房屋、頗有關係、茲擇錄該項假設及指令如下、</p>
<p>假設甲租賃之房屋、開設一規模宏大之商店、因原屋建築簡陋、目已朽敗、於是徵得乙之同意、自行出資、在該地翻造西式房屋多幢、計建築費約五萬餘元、又小費一萬八千餘元、仍歸甲繼續承租、惟契約上並未訂定且賃期限、僅及數年忽比鄰同房主之某商號内、因翻蓋原屋、乃出鉅額挖費、聳乙迫令甲遷讓後、密</p>
<p>商乙附股若干於乙之營業内、由乙假自用名義、挖令甲遷移、查處置房産、本爲業主之主權、自不能任房客永遠佔居、惟房主强令遷移、亦須顧及事實前民律債權編第二三○條第五節、關於賃貸借欵規定　詳、而於賃借主之權利保護尤爲周　、即新頒民法債編第四五○條云、「未定時限者、各當時得隨時終止契約、但有利於承租人之習慣者、從習慣」亦爲顧念承租人之利益而有此但書、今甲旣費鉅額金錢翻蓋新屋、工竣後不過數年、即令其遷出、其全部營業及建屋之　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　、</p>
<p>鉅費、將完全犠牲、此非特違反慣例（按上海一埠有房客自行出資建屋、十年内房主不得勒令遷移之習慣）抑且在背情理、而自用亦必須有必要之情形、僅附股於他人已開之商店此名合資營業、實與自用逈異、若懸爲成例、將使承租者全部事業、無所保障、貽害社會、殆非漢鮮、權衡祛律事實、如何適從之處、伏乞鈞院迅予平準之解釋、是民至辛</p>
<p>院令呈悉、業經發交最高法院擬具解答案、呈核前來、内開、承租人出資將租賃房屋改造、出租人知其情事而不爲反對之表示、如租賃契約未定期限、出租人自可隨時終止契約、但其改造費用、苟無特約、出租人於租賃關係終止時、應依該房屋現存之增作額償還、（參照民法債編第四三一條）至租債契約未定期限者·依民法債編第四五○條第二項之規定、若當習慣、於承租人之解約、有所限制、而有利於承租人者、應從其習慣等語、本院長審核無異、合行令仰知照、此令、</p>

<h3>胡蝶控鈴報案審訊紀</h3>
<p>雙方律師之雄辯</p>
<p>判决罰金三百元</p>
<p>盧溢芳不服上訴</p>
<p>明星電影公司女演員胡蝶、與未婚夫林雪懷發生解除婚約問題盧溢芳主編之三日刋鈴報、因登載胡林離婚記一文、謂胡曾入風塵、及依人爲小星、胡以該報有意譭謗名譽、延詹紀鳳律師致函更正、乃鈴報於更正文後、復附註「有聞必錄」之語、並於次期鈴報刋登明星公司男演員朱飛之照片、旁書「雪蝶離婚中之要角」數字、胡更認其故意破壞名譽、向特區地方法院提起刑事自訴、業經傳審、諭被告盧溢芳交五百元保傳證到案再訊各情、已詳前報、昨日午後、爲此案續審之期、二時許、</p>
<p>旁聽者已絡繹而至特院之第三法庭、頃刻座滿、後至諸人、無不鵠立、擠軋不堪、旋由馮世德推事升座、先訊一西人毆傷華人案、三時半審畢、始訊及胡蝶訴盧溢芳案、當由盧聲明</p>
<p>證人謝鹤羣已邀到馮推事訊據謝供稱、現以投稿爲業、上月二十六日、由無錫來申、因與盧溢芳爲友、次日午後、赴鈴報館訪盧、彼以欲回無錫、託我暫代其編輯職務、二十八日受事、盧當時相囑、謂外界有稿投到、每期將所投之稿編排已足、如係關於</p>
<p>時局之稿則須鄭重我共代編四期、所登胡林一稿亦係他人所投、原稿措詞、多爲肯定語、我删改後付刋、惟底稿由校對保管、存在與否、我實不知、至本月七日盧返、我遂交卸代理任務、故以後之事、俱不知矣、質之盧溢芳供、我回無錫期内、所豲稿、無人保管、皆已遺失、但我當時係對謝言自撰稿件、如不足始採登來稿、並須審查、實未囑其對來稿概予登載等語、又據</p>
<p>鈴報校對徐小倩供稱、胡林一稿、已經遺失、至八十二期鈴報所登朱飛之照片、係我於排版時、因稿件不敷、適印刷所中有此銅版、遂取而刋之、以補空白、旁書雪蝶離婚中之要角一語、亦係我所爲、編輯不知、亦無任何用意云云、旋開始辯論、先由原告律師詹紀鳫聲稱、本案因胡林發生解除婚約事件後、</p>
<p>各報咸登此項新聞被告盧溢芳、兩度往原告家、與原告之父相晤、初次亦係採訪新聞、第二次表示願爲原告援助攻擊林某、索津貼二三百元、胡蝶之父拒絶、被告遂在報上盡量是破壞原告名譽、此即詐財不遂之結果、其譭謗最重大者、有指原告</p>
<p>曾爲妓女又爲小星旣誣與人有關係等之一點、不特使原告身敗名裂、害及職務、抑且不能置身社會、生計名譽、當然受極大之影響、故函該報、要求更正、乃其八十期並不更正、而於八十一期、則作不忠實更正、無殊證明其七十九期所記爲實在、詎於八十三期、又登朱飛照片、指爲離婚中要角、</p>
<p>含血噴人予人難堪而被告則强辯彼於其時已赴無錫、職務託人代理、然其所供日期、殊多自相矛盾、故原告之自訴理由充分、乃被告自知罪有應得、無可逭免、竟挑撥其</p>
<p>同業對本律師示威僞造十五家小報署名之信函、前來詰問、但現已有數家、聲明被其假昌、本律師前次所言、專對被告而發、不涉其他、總之被告純因索詐不遂、任意譭謗、應請依照刑法三二五條從重懲辦、附帶民訴、請求移付民庭訊理云云、被告盧溢芳、延黃覺·張恂子·兩律師辯護、先由黃律師辯稱、當時被告不在上海、此層已經證明、鈴報對胡林婚變、從未有只字披露、</p>
<p>實已尊重原告人格今原告所控詐欺取財一點、自係裝點之詞、不足置信、嗣盧赴錫、職務託之於謝、而謝秦無編小報經騐、見外間投到關於胡林稿件、彼因社會甚注意此事、遂將該稿付刋、毫無用意、</p>
<p>依律無故意之行爲不負刑事責任、而故失亦不負刑事責任、請求宣告被告無罪、繼由張律師辯稱、原告所控索詐一節、被告認爲奇恥在辱、須請求澈究、至所登稿件、原告認爲譭謗者、僅風塵小星四字、按之典籍、唐有風塵三俠、</p>
<p>風塵二字豈譭謗耶至小星二</p>
<p>字、也於詩經、嚖彼小星、三五在東、乃古人詠作官者書夜勤勞之意、非譭謗之語、照出版法、所登如不實、一經更正、即不負責任、此爲特别法、凡例有特别法者、當、當依據特别法、不需普通刑法、今被告</p>
<p>已爲更正請判無罪云云、詹律師復駁之曰、誠如張律師所言、則報紙儘可任意造謡、一經他人函詰、即予更正、而以出版法爲護符、推翻刑法矣、雙方辯畢、馮推事當即判决盧溢芳毁損他人名譽、罰金三百元、如易科監禁、以二元折抵一日</p>

<h3>錦標　　歏</h3>
<p>噹噹的鐘聲打破了整個學校的靜寂空氣、敎室的門一開、學生好似潮水一般的擁了出來、有的因爲要免去擁擠、就在窗口裏跳了出來、各人臉上都表現出一種欣歡的神色、大概是因爲今天校内有重要的錦標比賽、他們又可以一飽眼福了、</p>
<p>我正在宿舍裏安放書籍、房門呀的一聲被人推門了、最頑皮的震走了進來、</p>
<p>「啊、你們不要用功了、考試還有二個星期哩、今天我們和六年級的足球比賽、是有錦標關係的、你們快一同去相帮助威呀、」</p>
<p>我對他一看、不竟笑了起來、他反穿了一件羊皮的袍子、頭上戴了一頂紙糊的帽子、手裏還拿着一面白布的旗、寫着「五年級啦啦隊」六個大字、</p>
<p>「震、你是啦啦隊的隊長嗎、」我這様問、</p>
<p>「嘸、是他們推舉我做的呀、你們不要躭擱時間了、快和我一同去罷、」</p>
<p>「你先去罷、我還有二問算題、做好了就來、」</p>
<p>「：：：：：坐在我對面的勤、正在出神地看書、好像没有聽見震的請求、　　「勤是用功學生、不肯同我們一起胡閙的、欣、你不要失約、做好了算題就來、」震這様説了、就回身出去了、</p>
<p>「這様大的人、還是這般胡閙、」勤忽然抬起頭來這様對我説、</p>
<p>「嘸：：：：：：」我一時想不出一個適當的回答、祇得含糊應了一聲、</p>
<p>本來預備做好算題就去看賽球的、但是給勤這様一説、却有些不好意思了、就在書架上拿了一本學生雜誌、隨便翻閲、</p>
<p>「啦啦啦：：：五年級勝利、：：：啦啦啦：：：：六年級勝利：：：：：」</p>
<p>一陣巨大而嘈雜的聲音、傅佈到我的耳膜上、心房裏起了一陣强烈的震動、看書也没有心思了、</p>
<p>「我意不能克制自已、受了這種聲音的聳恿、也要去加入胡閙了、」我很慚愧地對勤説、</p>
<p>「這是各人的歡喜、不能勉强、」勤很和藹似的回答、</p>
<p>走出了宿舍、已經看見操塲的四週站滿了人、裏面的情形一些也看不見、</p>
<p>「欣、你爲何到這時候纔來、操塲上人都站滿了、快些到這裏來、這裏還可以勉强軋一個人、我們現在已經勝了一球、健美　冰攝</p>
<p>今天錦標有希望了、」震在那邊看見了我、就一面向我招手、一面這様的對我説、</p>
<p>我擠進了人堆裏、第一件觸目的東西、就是擺在球門後面檯子上那個銀色燦爛的錦標、外面還套了一隻精緻的綠綢匣子、因爲受了夕陽的照耀、一閃一閃地放出那眩目的光芒、好像在那裏矜誇它的威𢹸、它使得這許多同學荒棄了他們的功課、來這裏歡迎它、擁護它、使得二級的球員、犠牲了他們精神力氣、去做它的奴隸、它的魔力多麽偉大呀、</p>
<p>「欣、你看老王多少敏捷、已經盤到了他們的腹地、又要打進隻了、」震用手指着老王對我説、打斷了我的亂想、</p>
<p>「老王的球藝比前進步了、」</p>
<p>「進步許多了、」</p>
<p>「Ｇoal」四週的同學、忽然起了一個如雷地呼聲、</p>
<p>「老王眞可愛、又打進了一隻、我們快來啦幾聲助助威、」震走到我們面前、對一班載紙糊帽子的啦啦隊這様地説、</p>
<p>啦啦隊的呼聲、轉移了四週同學的視線、他們看見震反穿的皮袍子、和一班啦啦隊的紙糊帽子、都張開了嘴笑個不停、</p>
<p>又開球了、仍是我們佔得優越的形勢、球堂在他們的地界上滚來滚去、震和一班啦啦隊、都是拼命的呐喊、鼓勵他們的勇氣、喊得喉嚨都啞了、還不肯停止、</p>
<p>「噓：：：：：」時間到了、裁判員在那裏吹他的笛子了、</p>
<p>震和一班啦啦隊、都跑進了塲内、把老王舉了起來、坐在他們的肩上、口裏還在唱他們的得勝歌、老王也很得意地的和他的朋友點頭、</p>
<p>那輝煌壯麗的錦標、早已被我們的隊長小莊拿在手裏了、在同學的擁護和歡呼聲中、走進了宿舍、曾經擠滿了同學的操塲上、祗剩了些呐喊歡呼的餘音、</p>
<h3>中公風潮中的軼事　健·堂</h3>
<p>關於中公這次風潮的事情、海上各報都已大載特載過了、惟尙有一二様瑣事、似乎需要我這個無名記者來記的、所以我現在不顧𫍾陋、也拿起秃筆來胡寫亂畫了、</p>
<p>小孩子對老頭子</p>
<p>那次于右任先生來校宣佈維持意思時、曾在運動塲上（因大禮堂過小）向千多同學作一度很誠懇的勸告、内有「：：：你們不好好讀書、祇是一味胡鬧、等到日後和我一様長的鬍子時、那才知道不得了了、「眞是小孩子、小孩子、」等語、頗引起一般同學注意、後來有某君赴滬、於火車中見有二三代表圑要人在一塊兒大聲談笑、頗有忘形之概、於是某君肅容以聽、原來是這様説、</p>
<p>「他少年時都知道革命、我們做這事、也是革命的表現呢、」</p>
<p>「他駡我們是小孩子、小孩子、我們也可以駡他做老頭子、老頭子、哈哈哈、：：：」</p>
<p>某君聽到這裏、也不禁嗤然大笑、後來回語各同學、亦盡爲之鬧堂、並且有人要做詩大贊特贊他們的天才云、</p>
<p>埀涎三尺</p>
<p>在于右任先生蒞校的前一天、校長佈告處曾貼有于先生親筆所寫的字兩張、一是宣佈明日下午幾點鐘到校維持的佈告、一是致全體同學書、都是用宣紙寫的、並且蓋了章的、於是一班同學聚論紛紛、有的説、</p>
<p>「啊、好一筆字啊、我可惜不能得到牠、」</p>
<p>又有的説、「呀、你看他是用宣紙寫的、並且蓋了章的、這明明是他老人家讓我們好拿去裱的意思、不過、我不知有没有得到牠的福氣、：：：」</p>
<p>「是啊、你可有那福氣、」</p>
<p>「：：我們中誰有那様的福氣、」</p>
<p>「：：：：：：」</p>
<p>「：：：：：：」</p>
<p>這様一陣暄鬧過後、那偉大的夜幕就漸漸地展開了、忙碌的人兒也都慢慢的入了睡鄉的深處了、這時有個雄赳赳的糾察隊、持着一根龐大的木棍、飛一般的跑到校長佈告處去想做得着那張墨寳那張字早已「不翼而飛」了、第二日早晨、綠色的玻璃鏡匡底下、還絡續地來了不少的靑年男子、妙齡女人、在那里現着一種驚奇的情形、徘徊不忍去、</p>

<h3>最後的一晚　·問·鵑</h3>
<p>下午六點鐘到九點、是我們寄宿舍中的黃金時代、七八個同學們圍住火爐看著書、或是打打絨線東西、假使還有一堆花生米和幾只橘子的話、那就是擁有全世界亦不過如此了、</p>
<p>她們手裏一上一下的動著、紅的綠的名種各様的顔色、在電燈下顯得格外美麗、而她們談話的聲音、也如手中的絨女子兵式操　冰攝</p>
<p>線圑一様的抽之不盡、其餘的各人也有一心鑽進書裏邊、什麽事都不聞不見的她們側著頭像是十分有趣味的様子、或者時而在雜記簿上寫點什麽、至於眼光移到别人的身上、那不過是偶然的一瞬罷了、</p>
<p>獨有Ｓ一個人靜靜地坐在一角、旣臉上會紅起來、又白下去的、或者忽然咬著嘴唇微微地一笑、她的這種心理上所表現出來的意味、完全不與眼前的環境相關連、這是很顯然的、</p>
<p>和Ｓ坐得最算近的茜、本來在抄寫什麽的、也常常因爲她的鄰居的緣故而抛下手中的筆、并且面上　著愁悶的神氣、如其在燈光不是被她的書遮住的時候、還可以看見她的眼睛裏滿含著淚水、</p>
<p>最喜歡多説話的蕙、渾名快嘴姑娘的她就唱起來道、</p>
<p>「悲莫悲兮别離、樂莫樂兮新婚、絲姊、你離關舊侶去建立新家庭、也不想、你的茜是怎様的形單影隻的與凄零、」</p>
<p>她的歌聲一止、　座的神情都改變了、有的是停針不語、或者用依戀似的跟光望著正在修剪指甲的絲、看書的也抛下了她們的書、心思離開了書中的天國而走回現實的境界裏來了、室中的空氣擲鐵餅　冰攝</p>
<p>頓時緊張起來、人人都像有什麽話要説、但都説不出一句、</p>
<p>「怎麽了、你們、」絲含羞地問、聲音低得像蚊子呌一様、</p>
<p>「你和我們在一塊兒座祗有這一晚了、三年同學、一旦分離、不要説茜、就是我們也覺得怪難過的、」多悉易感的痕、説著話、忽然用手絹去揩她的眼睛、</p>
<p>「我就會回來的、」絲依然低了地説、　　「是啊、學業是要緊的、」痕接口道、　　茜的頭埋進書裏、只見她的肩背微微地抽動、</p>
<p>「爲什麽人們都喜歡在冬天結婚、難道别的時候就結不得婚嗎、」快嘴姑娘又來發議論了、</p>
<p>「我不相信絲的未來「板凳一也是迷信舊俗的人、恐怕因爲要到東三省去服務所以想帶了新夫人一同走、更加顯得風頭一點吧、」這個聲音發自火爐後邊、是樂觀派的懷、</p>
<p>「有什麽好呢、肥頭胖臉的傢伙、我見他像蒼蠅粘住蜜似的貼在絲身邊走的時候、我就有氣、下星期不呌我去送親便罷、要叫我去送親、我就打他一頓出出氣、」快嘴姑娘説著、眞的在揑她的拳頭、</p>
<p>絲的面孔轉紅白、手裏的剪刀跌下去、她也不曾覺得、</p>
<p>「她在煩惱吧、還是喜樂呢、「一個女人的出嫁、就像又投一次人身、」這句雖然是俗語、但是雅到即使不吃人問烟火食的女人們、又那能例外呢祗要一嫁人她的全部生活就通統變了、她們的行爲舉止變、性情變了、簡直另換一個人了、從前的舊式婚姻不用説、就是現在的戀愛結婚又何嘗不如此、我雖不是男子、更不是賈寳玉式的男子、然而每回遇到同學們的出嫁、總是感到極端的心痛、常常暗歏道、唉、吾輩中又少一人了、少女的最可寳貴的粉紅色的路程業已走盡、就是戀愛的時詩様的愛境怕也要從此消滅了、瑣碎的家務、兒女的拖累、都是磨减女人們花様的靑春的利器、不但是生理上容易早衰、就是以前的皎潔的振作的心靈、恐怕也要蒙上一重烟霧了、雖然是世界上不少美滿的結婚生活、可是我的偏見、總看不出内中的樂趣、我總以爲這是一具腐臭的骸屍、蒙上一層錦幛：：：：」我正默想到此、面上被擲來一様東西、喲好燙、我喊起來、一看是只煨山芋、便問、</p>
<p>「這時候還有煨山芋賣、多快九點了、」</p>
<p>「哈哈、這裏還有、你要不買、」懷笑著、原來她不知從什麽時候拿了生山芋來、一人悄悄地鑽在火爐後邊煨的、</p>
<p>「煨得好、可惜有點生、」快嘴又在放炮了、</p>
<p>「給你吃了還不好、」懷也不肯示弱、</p>
<p>方才愁悶的空氣、［突然被煨山芋衝破了一部分、但不久就恢復原狀、痕把椅子移近絲、兩人噥噥唧唧地説個不了、茜的眼睛永遠不曾乾燥過、</p>
<p>寢鐘打過了、但是没有人理會這個、這裏是我們的世界、指導員就是來、也奈保我們不得、反正我們没有吵鬧、怕她什麽、這種共同的心理支配著各人的動作、所以大家支撑、不肯説睡覺這句話、平常時候一到九點半、大概總是表面上安寢的了、今晚因爲絲的惜别、人人便覺得這一夜的光陰過於短促、恨不得不睡才好、還有、誰肯第一個離開此地呢、</p>
<p>「明天星期六功課輕、管他的、再坐一回、」懷説、她已完畢了煨山芋的任務、</p>
<p>「我不到東三省去、我寒假以前一定再回来、」絲和痕的談話落下了這様的一句、</p>
<p>「哼、看你吧、再來是不希望的了、只求你有了新知、不要把舊好一齊忘却、就感謝你的多情了、」痕的嗓子提高、眼圈兒也紅了、</p>
<p>「我替你留着你的床位、我保存你給我們的許多印象、只是每一次望到你空着的位置時、我又怎能夠不流眼淚呢、你是我們班裏的太陽、你去了、我覺得全世界都變成黑暗了、」樂觀的懷也在訴苦了、</p>
<p>絲的喜悅的面孔上、也罩上一層薄薄的愁霧、她的神氣又想哭似乎又想笑、末了、哭的情緖占了優勢、她的眼淚從那雙好看的眼睛裏一滴一滴的滴在衣襟上</p>
<p>屋子裏靜悄悄地、只有爐中的炭塊爆裂的響聲、格格地衝破這空閒的岑寂、</p>
<p>「我明天去告訴那只板凳、呌他要滚自已滚、我們的絲不嫁人了、豈不就完了嗎、你們這些人都是飯桶想不出法子來的、」快嘴的説話、引得衆人都大笑起來、</p>
<p>茜和痕·絲的眼淚掛在眼睛上、也笑得前仰後合的、</p>
<p>「當郎、當郎、」外面的鈴聲又響了、</p>
<p>「爲什麽、」我問、</p>
<p>「大概因爲我們不睡的緣故、」茜這一晚就開了這一聲口、顯然她是十分疲倦、只想快些跌在床上去大哭去了、</p>
<p>絲得了救星似的也站起來、拾起地上的剪刀、挽了茜的臂膊首先預備走、</p>
<p>「慢點、這是最後一晚了、不要那様無情、也不和你的許多老朋友們道一聲别、就能算了嗎、哼、吉期還早咧、」快嘴忿忿地説、</p>
<p>「不要性急、地球總要慢慢地轉的、」懷附和着、</p>
<p>「只要你説一句話、就許你走、你平心説一聲、究竟是同學們的愛情深、還是板凳的愛情深、」快嘴説着攔住了門、</p>
<p>「同｜｜同學的深、」絲無可奈何地低低説、</p>
<p>「哈哈、放她走吧、」大家笑着、</p>
<p>十點鐘敲過、隔壁的絲早睡着了、不知她曾夢見些什麽、或者是未來的幸福吧、</p>

<h3>Destruction of Railway Tracks and Robbery of Trains by Bandits on the Jin-Chao Branch Line of the Beining Railway</h3>
<p>Train Derails and Overturns</p>
<p>Boiler Explosion Causes Carelessness</p>
<p>Extremely High Number of Deaths and Injuries Under Investigation</p>
<p>Passengers' Property and Mail Robbed</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Gao Jiyi, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, telegraphed the Ministry of Railways and the Northeast Communications Committee on the evening of the 28th, stating that the No. 501 passenger train on the Jin-Chao branch line of the railway derailed on the evening of the 29th at 6:10 PM after leaving Nanling Station and passing in front of the No. 30 road guard station, about 15 li from Koubeiyingzi Station. Bandits had dismantled a section of the railway tracks, causing Locomotive No. 172 and three third-class passenger cars, one first- and second-class car, one baggage car, one postal car, and one material car to derail. Except for the first- and second-class car, which remained on the roadbed, the rest fell below the roadbed. The three foremost third-class cars, the baggage car, the postal car, and the material car were burned by the locomotive's fire, causing numerous deaths and injuries to passengers and railway workers. Passengers' property and mail were looted by the bandits. Upon receiving the telegram, the director immediately telegraphed Rong Lu, Director of the Military Affairs Office of the Northeast Border Defense, and Brigade Commander Zhang of the Yixian garrison, instructing the garrison to rush to the scene for rescue and requesting the Beipiao Mining Hospital to provide medical assistance to the injured passengers. The director also dispatched the Beining Railway's Jinzhou security team and a rescue train with engineering personnel from Jinzhou to assist in the rescue and repair. Director Xu of the General Affairs Department, Deputy Director Wang of the Transportation Department, and the section chiefs of the police, health, engineering, operation, mechanical, and business departments were sent to investigate and handle the aftermath. Further details will be reported later. According to investigations by reporters in the transportation sector, the accident site was a downhill slope, and the railway tracks were 85 feet above the ground. The dismantling of the railway tracks occurred at a turning point. The locomotive derailed with tremendous force, and the driver, with quick reflexes, jumped down and escaped safely. Two stokers died. The three third-class passenger cars fell from a height of over 80 feet, causing deaths and injuries to the passengers. The material car, which was behind the locomotive and contained matches and kerosene, likely exploded due to boiler negligence, engulfing the passengers in the three third-class cars in flames, with no survivors, numbering over 100. It was an unprecedented tragedy. Two clerks in the material car also died. The first- and second-class cars did not fall because they were lying on the roadbed, so there were no deaths, only 12 serious injuries and over 20 minor injuries, who were sent to the Beipiao and Jinzhou hospitals for treatment. The railway bureau is responsible for the medical expenses and meals. Director Gao stated that a large group of bandits was disturbing the area, which was beyond the railway's capabilities to resist. However, due to negligence in prevention, both the railway and the garrison should be held responsible. He expressed deep regret for the unfortunate incident and has sent Director Xu to express condolences to the injured. The damaged railway tracks were repaired on the evening of the 28th, and traffic can resume on the 29th. The overturned vehicles can only be put back on the tracks with a crane from an engineering train. The exact number of losses and casualties will be reported in detail within the day. As for the aftermath, the Ministry of Railways and Deputy Commander Zhang will be telegraphed for instructions. (Special telegram from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the night of the 27th, bandits robbed a train on the Jin-Chao section of the Beining Railway, resulting in 11 deaths and injuries among the train's staff and over 30 deaths and injuries among the passengers. Because it was late at night, by the time the military police arrived, the bandits had already looted all the valuables on the train. Upon receiving the report, Zang Jiyi urgently telegraphed the Northeast Border Defense to send a large army to pursue and suppress the bandits, and also sent Xu Wenguo, Director of the General Affairs Department, and five Chinese and foreign staff members, including Gu Lier, to investigate in detail. It is rumored that the case has international implications, as a certain country has been trying to undermine the development of railways in the Eastern Provinces. (Special telegram from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Beining Railway Bureau received a telegram from Beipiao Station on the evening of the 29th, stating that the exact number of casualties and losses from the Nanling Station train robbery is still under investigation, but it is known that there were many deaths. When the bandits left, they also abducted over 90 local merchants and residents, releasing over 70 of them on the way after learning that they had no wealth at home. (Special telegram from the 29th)</p>
<h3>Chen Qicai, Director of the Accounting Office Preparatory Committee, Assumed Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Qicai, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the National Government Accounting Office, held a declaration of office ceremony after the National Government Premier's Memorial Week on the 29th. Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Dai Chuanxian, Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Song Ziwen, Gu Yingfen, Wang Zhengting, Ma Fuxiang, Wang Boqun, Niu Yongjian, Liu Jiwen, Fang Juehui, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Shao Yuanchong, Wei Daoming, Chen Bulei, Li Shuhua, Zhang Wenhua, Lin Xiang, Wang Jiazhen, Liu Ruiheng, He Yaotu, Chen Yi, Jiao Yitang, and others attended. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek saluted, the seal-granting ceremony was held first. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek granted the seal, and Chen Qicai accepted the seal. Next was the swearing-in ceremony, which was supervised by Central Committee member Dai Chuanxian. After the swearing-in, the supervisor gave a speech, followed by a speech by the Chairman. Chen Qicai then gave a reply, and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>Dai Chuanxian's speech briefly stated that although the accounting system is a brand new system, it is actually the oldest good law in Chinese history and politics. The implementation of this system now is based on ancient ideas and incorporates the latest scientific methods from various countries, so that all financial accounting matters will have a definite plan and order and will not be as chaotic as before. At the same time, it will provide the government and the people with accurate records, making the past, present, and future clear. He expressed his confidence that after assuming office, Comrade Chen will use his precise mind, adopt the world's latest technical methods, and follow Premier Sun's teachings to strive to implement this system. He also hoped that from today onwards, the preparations would be completed in the shortest possible time, opening a new era for the government. Chairman Chiang's speech briefly stated that the accounting system is the most urgent and important aspect of politics. The government's selection of Comrade Chen to serve as Director of the Accounting Office Preparatory Committee is a great expectation that Comrade Chen will expedite preparations after assuming office, establish a solid foundation, enable the government to audit all expenditures, and serve as a national model with impartiality and strictness. Finally, Chen Qicai replied, stating that he, Chen Qicai, was ordered to serve as Director of the Accounting Office Preparatory Committee. Today, he swore an oath and was honored by the supervisor's and Chairman's instructions. He will faithfully abide by them. However, the accounting undertaking concerns the national financial policy, and he, Chen Qicai, is unlearned and lacks academic knowledge and experience. He originally did not dare to take on this responsibility rashly, but since he has been ordered, he will abide by Premier Sun's teachings, follow in the footsteps of the government's predecessors, and strive to implement the system with a faithful and sincere attitude. He hoped that the predecessors would give him more guidance so that he could follow it. After the reply, the ceremony ended with music. (Special telegram from the 29th)</p>
<h3>Northern Military Aftermath</h3>
<p>Zhang and Various Generals Meet for Several Days to Discuss</p>
<p>The Principle is to Reduce the National Burden</p>
<p>The Northwest Army is Reorganized by Song Zheyuan</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Su Quanbin, Director of the Northeast Military Supplies, Zhang Xueliang has been convening Northern generals in the Xingyuan for several days to discuss the military aftermath, with the principle of reducing the national burden. Efforts are being made to reduce the size of the Northwest Army and the Jin Army. The organization and salary system will be the same as those of the Northeast Army. The original Northeast Army will also find ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure in order to strive for construction. Zhang will convene Northern financial authorities in Tianjin in the near future to hold a meeting to reorganize finances. The issue of abolishing likin and increasing taxes will also be discussed. It is expected that after this meeting, the Northern political situation will be on track. (Special telegram from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sun Dianying hosted Zhang Xueliang for dinner on the evening of the 28th. After the meal, Zhang summoned Yang Aiyuan and Pang Bingxun for talks. He promised Pang and Sun that they would each be reorganized into an independent Class A division. The Zhili Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office will send personnel to inspect and verify the completion of the reorganization and then determine the garrison location. The Northeast will be responsible for the salaries. Sun Liangcheng will hand over his troops to Song Zheyuan for reorganization and will be hired as a military advisor to the Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office. Gao Guizi sent a representative, Chuan Mengxi, to Tianjin. Zhang promised to reorganize an independent brigade. (Special telegram from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Jingwu will arrive in Beiping from Tianjin within days to discuss the issue of abolishing likin in the North. According to sources, the result of his visit to Zhang was satisfactory. (Special telegram from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Commissioner Xu has been receiving telegrams from Shanxi for several days, stating that military bandits are openly looting and raping in more than 20 counties, including Jingle and Gaoping. Afterwards, they either flee or return to their units, making it impossible to suppress them. As a result, none of the robbery cases in the area have been solved, and the robbery trend is intensifying. If effective measures are not taken quickly, the entire Shanxi province will be ruined. Commissioner Xu and others are anxious and eager to return. The military aftermath has been agreed upon in Tianjin and is only awaiting the Central Government's new appointments for the Shanxi generals and the financial measures. Commissioner Xu, Song, and others will leave Tianjin as soon as the Central Government's reply arrives. Zhang received Qiu Yantian, Pang Bingxun, and Yang Aiyuan again yesterday and said that the Central Government's reply should arrive on the 29th. (Special telegram from the 29th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Middle Class</h3>
<p>A French newspaper described the economic situation in Germany, stating that four-fifths of the German people currently possess no capital whatsoever. Even those who have received a university education have incomes that barely sustain their lives. If they do not revert to the medieval system of public support for the poor and destitute, then in the future, there will likely only remain a few bankers and industrialists as the wealthy, with the rest becoming the proletariat. Although this only pertains to Germany, it is feared that this trend will inevitably lead to the disappearance of the middle class in countries with excessive industrial development. In most countries around the world, the middle class is larger than the capitalist and proletarian classes. The people of the middle class rely on operating medium-sized businesses and receiving various medium-level incomes to sustain their lives. Society relies on this large number of middle-class individuals to regulate surpluses and deficits, disseminate information, and mutually depend on each other for balanced development. However, since the global economic decline, prices have soared, and the cost of living has increased daily. People of the middle class are naturally the first to be affected. Those of the so-called capitalist class are either expanding their large-scale factories by methods such as rationalization or engaging in large-scale commercial activities through monopolistic manipulation. All middle-class entrepreneurs are encompassed by them. The financial resources and means of the middle class are unable to compete with them, and various expenditures cannot be reduced to maintain appearances. With income not covering expenses, they will inevitably reach a point where they cannot survive. Therefore, the middle class today faces the most difficult situation, with the highest unemployment. This is a most dangerous phenomenon. After all, no country in the world can stand solely on the foundation of the capitalist and proletarian classes. If the middle class cannot survive, then the small number of capitalists will likely not be able to stand tall above the proletariat. As the French newspaper stated, there is no way that the future will only consist of a few wealthy bankers and industrialists, with the rest becoming the proletariat. Those who seek to salvage the economic situation in the world should pay attention to the middle class.</p>

<h3>Early Revolution in Turkey</h3>
<p>Plotting to Restore the Religious System of Government</p>
<p>Nearly a Thousand Reactionaries Arrested</p>
<p>Ankara, 29th (National News Agency) Yesterday's special cabinet meeting, chaired by Mr. Kasi, decided to use strict measures to quell the initial revolutionary riots in Simna and Menisa. The governors of the two provinces have been replaced, and all affairs have been placed in the hands of military officers. The entire province has now been placed under martial law.

Four battalions of Antonin Lin's army, suspected of defecting, have been disarmed.</p>

The authorities believe that this rebellion is definitely not limited to one corner and must be a prelude to a major movement aimed at overthrowing the Kemal government. The government held an important meeting yesterday, attended by key figures such as Chairman Kemal, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Interior, and the Chief of Staff, which lasted for eight hours.

<h3>Discovery of Large Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province</h3>
<p>Location near Hegang Mine</p>
<p>Estimated Area of Over One Hundred Square Li</p>
<p>Sufficient for Six Hundred Years of Mining</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Hegang coalfield in Heilongjiang Province has long been known for its richness. However, this was based on geological speculation. The actual discovered coal reserves were only a few square li. After Wan Guobin was appointed by Heilongjiang Province to take over the mine, the good upper coal seams were gradually exhausted. Observers stated that the Hegang coal mine must actively excavate large shafts to extract the lower coal seams. However, the cost of excavating coal shafts requires millions of dollars, which is impossible when the mine lacks capital. Recently, the mine hired geologist Ding Zaijun and mining expert Chen Jiasan to inspect the mine and dispatched personnel to explore and test it. After three months of work near the Hegang coal mine, three coal seams were discovered, forming a large coal mine of over one hundred square li. The total reserves are estimated at 226.55 million tons. If more than one thousand tons are mined daily, it can supply mining for six hundred years. Among them, the portion available for mining in Mingshan has as much as 28.5 million tons. If one thousand tons are extracted daily, it can supply mining for eighty years. Exploration is currently ongoing, and future discoveries are immeasurable. The Heilongjiang Provincial authorities plan to raise a large amount of capital to expand the mining operations at the Hegang coal mine after all exploration is completed. (23rd)</p>
<h3>Commencement of Surveying for the Qi-Hei Railway</h3>
<p>The Heilongjiang Provincial Government has decided to construct it.</p>
<p>Construction will begin after the spring thaw next year.</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Qi-Hei Railway, a trunk line traversing over 800 li from Qiqihar to Daheihe in the northeastern half of Heilongjiang Province, was originally proposed in the first year of the Republic of China. At that time, the Russo-Asiatic Bank, entrusted by the Chinese Eastern Railway, requested China to sign an agreement for it to undertake the construction as a Sino-Russian joint venture. Surveyors were dispatched, and line maps were drawn, ready to commence work. However, the European War broke out, followed by the Russian Revolution. Zhu Qinglan, the former General of Heilongjiang, announced the abolition of the original agreement, and China recovered the right to build it independently. Because the line map passed through many mountains, ridges, rivers, and canals, the construction of culverts and bridges would require too much money, causing a delay of more than ten years with no one proposing it. It was not until the era of Chang Yin-huai, who headed Heilongjiang, that the matter was re-deliberated, partly to establish his own power and partly in view of the enthusiastic immigration and increasing number of reclaimers. In recent years, the Heilongjiang Provincial authorities have deeply understood that the construction of railways not only facilitates transportation but also has great benefits for the national economy and people's livelihood. Moreover, the Hu-Hai, Tao-Ang, Qi-Ke and other roads built in recent years have achieved remarkable results, so they decided to build this road. After discussions by the Heilongjiang Provincial Government Committee, a budget was prepared, and a concrete plan was formulated. All matters concerning the proposed construction funding and material procurement have been discussed and resolved. In mid-October of this year, Chief Technician Wu of the Qi-Ke Road and fourteen other scholars were assigned to form a survey team. They departed from the provincial capital towards Heihe in early November. Starting from Moergen, they reached Heihe on November 26. They plan to pass through Qionghui, Qike, and Longzhen, returning to Moergen. The round trip is on two lines, and they will conduct detailed surveys separately to prepare for submission to the provincial government for selection of construction. It is estimated that surveying will be completed in another month, and construction will begin after the thaw next year. This line passes through areas rich in forests and minerals. After the opening of traffic, it will add a major source of wealth to the Northeast. (23rd)</p>

<p>Local Dispatches</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Two Robbery Cases: The home of Gu Fengchun, a farmer in Du Lai Village, was suddenly attacked by a bandit boat with several bandits on board the other night. They rummaged through boxes and chests, searching and looting at will, but there were no valuables, and only a hundred or so yuan were robbed. In Du Jia Village, sixteen bandits speaking with a northern accent and holding sharp blades suddenly arrived in the middle of the night. They searched the Yin-owned fishing boat first parked in the river, then went to the Chen Xingyu's house, broke down the door and entered, and plundered at will. Because the victim shouted for help, several men and women were wounded by blades. They left at about 3 a.m. the next morning. The total loss was several hundred yuan. The case has been reported to the county government for investigation. New Education Bureau Director Takes Office: Since the former director of the County Education Bureau, Yang Lucun, resigned, the Education Department immediately appointed Yuan Weiwen to take over. However, Yuan has not taken office for four or five months, causing the county's education to be almost at a standstill for half a year. It is understood that Yuan arrived at the bureau the other day, and will take over matters first, and will be sworn in on another date.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Water Police Captain Rescues Hostage: Ding Ziren, the manager of the No. 2 Factory of the Shanghai New Flour Mill, was kidnapped by bandits in front of the factory on the 19th of this month, and a large ransom was demanded, but there has been no news of him. Gong Guozhen of the 3rd Squad of the 1st Water Police Team, after receiving a report from an informant, personally led Inspector Yuan Changbiao to search a firewood boat moored at Zhongdu Bridge. The bandits, seeing the police, immediately went ashore to escape. The water police opened fire to pursue them, killing a young girl on the boat. The bandits all fled. Ding Ziren, who had been held in the boat for several days, was finally rescued.</p>
<p>Sun Xiangyun Kidnapping Case Opens: The case of Sun Xiangyun's kidnapping near Zhu Jia Hang in Xinzhuang has been pending for many months. After repeated investigations by the water and land police, suspects Liu A Si, Yu Fu Gen, Huang Miao Gen, Yang Jin Lin, Lu Jin Sheng, Sun Shou Mei and others were apprehended. The prosecutor's office concluded the investigation and filed a lawsuit in the county court. Judge Huang appointed lawyer Wu Lvping for Liu A Si and Yu Fu Gen for mandatory defense, and Sun Shou Mei also hired Chen Qiushi as his defense. Plaintiff Sun Xu Shi and Sun Bao Yun commissioned lawyer Yuan Xihao to appear in court. At 10 am on the 29th, Judge Li ascended to the criminal court and summoned the suspects for questioning, but the confessions varied. Lawyer Wu raised various points and requested the court to reinvestigate. The plaintiff argued that the defendants had already confessed, requesting sentencing in accordance with the criminal provisions of the indictment. After a lengthy debate, it was heard that the judge had approved a reinvestigation and adjourned the sentencing.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Dashu Town Robbed by Bandits: Dashu Town in Changpu Township of this county is located on the shore of Dianshan Lake and has always been an area where lake bandits appear. At 8 pm on the 26th, two bandit boats arrived, carrying thirty to forty lake bandits ashore. They first cut off the telephone line, then robbed door to door, and dozens of shops in the town were spared. They did not stop until 10 pm, then lined up to get on the boat, and kidnapped two people, heading towards Dianshan Lake. Wei Renzheng, the director of the Zhangpu Public Security Bureau, rushed armed police officers to pursue after receiving the report, but the bandits had already gone far away.</p>

<p>The Story of Han Zhuang's Martyr: Chen Xingxian, a resident living at No. 2, Xinglong Bridge, Beili Chengjiao, Xiyi, has been making a living by running Han Zhuang. The Zhuang flower, named Hua Li Shi, is a 27-year-old from Suzhou, with a cunning face. Young men were enchanted by her charm. Recently, a guest, Du A Er, 29 years old, lived in Qian Cai County and worked as a partner in a tobacco shop. Du saw Hua Li Shi's charming appearance, and a thought of sensual pleasures arose. They hooked up with each other, and gradually became lovers. They stayed in the village for eight nights in a row. Until the night before, Du A Er was exhausted, and his body became as soft as cotton, on the verge of death. Seeing this, Hua Li Shi quickly got up, put on clothes, and reported to the Zhuang owner, asking for help. At dawn, the Zhuang owner Chen Xingxian immediately sent someone to notify Du A Er's family. Du's wife, Zhang, requested Du A Er's friend, Gui Mi A Si, to go to Han Zhuang and carry Du A Er back home. The life was prolonged until yesterday morning, and Du died. Du told his wife before he died that there was a wallet with 107 yuan in it, which was left in Chen Xingxian's home. Seeing that her husband was dead, Du Zhang had to prepare the coffin by herself. She went to Chen Xingxian's home to ask for the relics. Chen Xingxian returned the wallet and flashlight. Du Zhang inspected the wallet, found it empty, and asked Chen Xingxian to hand over the money. Chen Xingxian refused to admit that she had hidden the money, so the two sides quarreled. They reported it to the police. The patrolman took the household Zhu You Shi, Chen Xingxian, Hua Li Shi, and others, to the first branch of the Public Security Bureau. Inspector Qin opened the court and put Song You Shi on trial for allowing prostitution, and sentenced her to 15 days of detention. Chen Xingxian was sentenced to 10 days of detention for being a matchmaker, injuring customs. Hua Li Shi was sentenced to 15 days of detention for adultery with a guest, and her actions were not inspected.</p>

<p>Police Officer, Doctor, and Editor Conspire to Defraud Money Case: Zhang Guoxian, a native of Dongcang Street outside Xiaodongmen in this county, is eighteen years old and addicted to opium. In early June, someone reported to the Third Police Station of the Public Security Bureau, and Police Officer Xu Jinjian sent police to arrest Zhang and others. Then, Xie Sheng San, the editor of the Ta Kung Pao, interceded and asked Zhang to pay 540 yuan to leave the country, which Zhang agreed to, and wrote a promissory note for 300 yuan as Xie's reward. It is said that Police Officer Xu wanted Zhang to be handed over to the county judiciary due to procedural relationship. Xie Sheng San forged a certificate from Zhang Chongxi, the director of Haiyu Hospital, certifying that Zhang Guoxian had quit smoking in the hospital and had been successfully detoxified, so as to confuse the judge during the trial. Shen Cheng, the trial officer, determined that the director of Haiyu Hospital was not an official doctor, and issued a letter to Jishan Hospital for verification. It was found that Zhang was still addicted to opium, and Zhang was sentenced to two months in prison and a fine of 260 yuan. Xie Sheng San again demanded the money from Zhang based on the promissory note, and Zhao Shaogu (a teacher in the county), Zhang's maternal uncle, discovered that he was defrauding money and sued the county judiciary. Xie Sheng San was arrested first. The county government summoned the plaintiffs and defendants, and Police Officer Xu Jinjian, Doctor Zhang Chongxi, and Police Chief Hu Derong and other ten people for investigation on the afternoon of the 27th. According to the plaintiff Zhang Guoxian, the police came to catch opium at the third police station on the 18th of this month. Xie Sheng San, the editor of the Ta Kung Pao, came to mediate, saying that he knew the county magistrate and the trial officer, so it didn't matter. As long as money was used, Xie Sheng San said that 540 yuan was handed over to Police Officer Xu Jinjian, and he only received two promissory notes for 300 yuan. Police Officer Jin said that he knew nothing. Dr. Zhang Chongxi said that Zhang Guoxian had come to him to quit smoking, and Xie Sheng San introduced him. However, when Zhang Guoxian was questioned, he did not go to quit smoking, and the certificate was obtained by Xie Sheng San. Therefore, the judge determined that the three had conspired to defraud money and arrested Zhang Chongxi, the director of Haiyu Hospital, Xu Jinjian, the police officer of the Third Police Station, and Xie Sheng San, the editor of the Ta Kung Pao. The next day, the General Bureau of Public Security dismissed Hu Derong, the police chief of the Third Police Station, and others.</p>

Chen, Shuhu's wife, saw that the situation was not good and wanted to go to the attic, but was shot and killed by the bandits with two bullets in a row. The robbers fled north after the incident. The district office reported the case to the county government and the county court on the 28th and requested the arrest.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Robbery Cases Abound at the End of the Year: The bandit forces in the western countryside are becoming more and more rampant, and robberies and kidnappings occur frequently. On the 26th, the home of Chen Youlin in Daijiadian, Shengang, was robbed and looted, and his six-year-old son was kidnapped and demanded to pay 1,000 yuan in three days. In Hui Di of Chou Zhuangxi, the clan hall of the Min family in Houmei Minjiadai, where the clan chief Min Jinyi received 200 yuan in rent, was robbed by bandits the other night. Chen Qinshu's home in Lanmensha was robbed the other night. His son crossed the river and asked for help from the nearby salt patrol. The bandits heard the gunfire and fled. Sun Cailang's home in Zhangjiagang, the second district, received a threatening letter on the 23rd, requiring a loan of 1,000 yuan to be paid within five days. On the night before last, more than ten bandits broke in and robbed, losing 1,000 yuan. Xue Zijing's home in Daxu, Sansheng Town, was also robbed by bandits the other night, losing more than 1,000 yuan. Before leaving, they demanded 300 yuan to be paid within a week and went to Wushan. Cao Daqiao, a native of Jingjiang, visited his brother in Hengshan Bridge, Wujin yesterday (26th). He encountered a bandit on the way through Yejimiao in Xiagang. He was captured by the local security team. After questioning, it was found that he was a bandit named Tai Rongda, who was wanted by the former county magistrate Ren during his tenure. He was sent to the county yesterday for trial and detention.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Military and Police Search Tonghui Gong Yarn Factory: The Xiaoshan County Government Public Security Bureau received a secret report stating that there were many Sheng bandits in the remaining 45 rooms and 43 rooms of the Tonghui Gong Yarn Factory outside Dongmen, and there were many wooden shells. Please order the team to search and arrest them to ensure local security. After receiving the report, Director Gao immediately telegraphed the People's Hall and sent a large platoon of security teams, and telegraphed the Ren County Public Security Bureau to send a platoon of security teams, and four patrol police teams and four police teams of the bureau. Director Gao and Team Leader Zheng, Inspector Chen and Police Officer Chen led the team to rush to the area on the evening of the 25th to search house by house. It is a pity that the bandits had already fled upon hearing the news, so nothing was found.</p>
<p>Request to Rebuild the Dangerous Xiao-Shao Causeway: The Xiao-Shao Causeway has always been built by raising funds locally. Later, due to the danger of the causeway project and the lack of funds, the causeway lottery was issued. It was merged into the Qiantang River Engineering Bureau in the sixteenth year, and then merged into the Water Conservancy Bureau last year. Due to limited funding, repairs were neglected. Engineer Dong of Shao-Xiao Gate has reported that the causeway body of 314 and a half zhang from Sunjia Ferry to Lao Shi Causeway has many cracks and is very dangerous. He has formulated a repair plan and approved a budget of more than 85,000 yuan for the causeway project. He requested the Department of Construction to forward it to the provincial government for approval, so as to raise funds and start construction.</p>

<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Xu Wenfu Escapes from Bandits: Xu Wenfu, who was abducted in the robbery case in Xian Da Village, is the head of the village's security team and village chief. He usually has a self-important behavior, so he has many complaints. Since being kidnapped, his family has entrusted people to inquire everywhere, but there has been no news. Now the bandits have found that Xu is not wealthy, but just a small well-off family, and have voluntarily lowered the price for his release. He has escaped from the bandits the other day and released to return home.</p>
<p>Zhang Yan's Regular Ship Robbed: Zhang Yan's regular ship left the town yesterday. When passing through Xinmiao Town in the eastern territory of Yaqian, it was suddenly encountered by bandits who boarded the ship and searched, taking away 4,000 to 5,000 yuan in cash that the town's shops had sent to the money shop in the city.</p>
<p>Anecdotes of Robbing Xinpu Town: One or two days before the town was robbed, many people disguised as hawkers, selling spiced dried tofu, or pickled mustard greens, dried radishes, etc., and broke into wealthy homes everywhere, claiming to be selling, secretly surveying the route, and staying overnight in the hotel opened by Jia Lao Si at night. Therefore, this time, the Bei Shi and Zhong Shi were robbed house by house, and none were spared. The Nan Bei Pawnshops, Changhao Rice Shop, Soybean Cake Shop, and Tianlun Cloth Shop were all robbed, only Nanshi suffered less damage because more than a dozen anti-smuggling patrol boats were moored, firing shots to show their power, such as Taiji Wood Shop and others did not suffer.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Hostage Peng Zhengfa Shot to Death: Peng Zhengfa, a resident of Fangjia Yang near Shizuka, a village in the southern district of Huzhou, was robbed by bandits and abducted last month. It is heard that Peng's family has entrusted people to negotiate everywhere, but it has been a long time and there has been no clue. A few days ago, Peng's family suddenly received a letter from a villager in Changshu, saying that a hostage named Peng Zhengfa who had been kidnapped by bandits had been shot to death on the way. Peng's wife immediately asked her relative Yu to go to Changshu to inquire. According to the villagers, a group of bandits were attacked by the police a few days ago, and each bandit fled elsewhere. The hostage Peng Zhengfa was accidentally hit by a bullet and was seriously injured. The bandits abandoned Peng here. After Peng was shot, he could still speak, and told the circumstances of the kidnapping and the address of his hometown, and asked to send a letter to notify his family to come and claim him. He died at dusk. According to Yu, after returning to the village and contacting Peng's wife, he prepared the necessary items and went to Changshu to collect the coffin and return home on the other day.</p>
<p>The Head of the Changxing Detective Team is Suspected of Colluding with Bandits: Since Team Leader Wang Ziqi took over the Second Security Team of this city, he has spared no effort in suppressing bandits. It is heard that Team Leader Wang went to the western village for inspection a few days ago. When he went to a place belonging to Changxing County, he heard that Wang Jinrong, the head of the Detective Team of the County Public Security Bureau, and Xu Junyou, the detective, and Song Waizui and Xiao Pangzi, the detectives, were suspected of colluding with bandits. Therefore, yesterday he personally escorted the gang to Huzhou and planned to investigate in detail before handling the case.</p>

<h3>The Protracted Tsinghua University President Issue</h3>
<p>Students Request Chairman Chiang to Appoint a President Quickly</p>
<p>| Nominating Zhou Yichun, Zhao Yuanren, and Hu Shih |</p>
<p>Since the issue of the Tsinghua University president arose, it has been over half a year. Although the students have expressed their opinions on the selection of a successor, the true state of affairs internally and the reasons why the Ministry of Education has not yet made a statement remain largely unknown to the outside world. Some speculate that Tsinghua's abundant funding and beautiful environment have attracted many aspirants, which, although conjecture, is not entirely without basis. We have obtained a collection of telegrams and documents sent by the university's student union to the Ministry of Education this semester, disclosed as follows: Telegram of October 19th, "To Minister Chiang of the Ministry of Education in Nanjing: Our university's students firmly oppose Luo Jialun's return to the university. Please approve his resignation quickly. Tsinghua University Student Union, Hao." Telegram of November 15th, "To Minister Chiang of the Ministry of Education in Nanjing: The entire student body has resolved in a general assembly to request that you promptly approve Luo Jialun's resignation and appoint one of the three gentlemen, Zhou Yichun, Zhao Yuanren, or Hu Shih, as his successor. Tsinghua University Student Union, Xian." Letter of November 18th, "Regarding the request for the prompt approval of Luo Jialun's resignation and the selection of a worthy successor to maintain the university's operations and benefit education: The issue of our university's president has been in dispute for a long time. Since the departure of former President Luo Jialun, the university's affairs have been left in a state of uncertainty for several months. The students earnestly hope that you will have a fair solution. We have repeatedly telegraphed our request for the early approval of Mr. Luo's resignation, hoping to gain your understanding. However, a few months ago, we read your telegram to the university's council, which did not heed the students' public request but insisted on retaining Mr. Luo and temporarily assigning someone as an agent. We were greatly shocked. An investigation revealed that Mr. Luo's departure was partly due to the reasonable demands of the entire student body and partly due to his own recognition of the difficulties and withdrawal. With feelings as opposed as ice and charcoal, there is no possibility of his return. The country is full of capable individuals, and there is theoretically no need for his return. The students only hope that the successor will be a capable person who can ensure that they can study in peace. Why would you insist on retaining Mr. Luo, creating more disputes? The students know that the authority to decide on the president's appointment and removal rests with you, but the key to education lies in finding the right person. The president is the master of a university and is related to the future of the nation. His knowledge and character should be admired by the students internally and praised by society externally, so that he can lead with a gentle breeze and nurture future generations. Mr. Luo served as president of our university for two years, but there was no actual progress in the university's affairs, and incidents regarding his departure have occurred several times. This shows that he is not suitable for our university. If there is disagreement, he should leave. Mr. Luo himself has seen this, but you insist on retaining him, which we, the students, cannot understand after much contemplation. Holding our books, we are deeply worried and restless. Therefore, on November 5th, the entire student body unanimously passed a resolution to request again that you promptly approve Mr. Luo's resignation and appoint one of the three gentlemen, Zhou Yichun, Zhao Yuanren, or Hu Shih, as his successor. These three gentlemen are fully qualified to shoulder heavy responsibilities and have a character that can win people's respect. Their knowledge and experience are in line with the high expectations. We believe you are already familiar with them. We have already telegraphed everything on the 15th and reiterate our previous request, sincerely asking you to appoint talented people for the sake of the country and grant our request to maintain the university's operations and benefit education. All matters concerning the request for the prompt approval of Luo Jialun's resignation as president of our university and the selection of one of the three gentlemen, Zhou Yichun, Zhao Yuanren, or Hu Shih, as his successor, are respectfully submitted in writing for your consideration. We would be eternally grateful. Respectfully presented to Minister Chiang of the Ministry of Education." Letter of December 24th to Chairman Chiang, "Regarding the request for the swift appointment of a president to benefit the university's operations: Unfortunately, the issue of the president of our university has been ongoing for over half a year. Although the university council has maintained operations and prevented the interruption of studies, a group without a leader will inevitably stir up trouble. A university without a president may lead to malicious schemes. We have previously telegraphed the Ministry of Education repeatedly, requesting a swift resolution, hoping to gain your understanding. Our university's opposition to Luo Jialun is purely out of sincere love for the university and is the unanimous demand of the entire student body. Judging from the resolutions of the student body's general assemblies, almost no one sympathizes with Mr. Luo. The situation can be easily imagined. Furthermore, what is Mr. Luo's character, knowledge, qualifications, and abilities? You have surely seen everything clearly and know it well. We fear that rumors from afar may be inaccurate and that malicious individuals may exaggerate, attempting to unjustly tarnish our university's reputation. Therefore, we must present the facts again. Now, the selection of presidents for various national universities has been announced and they have assumed their positions. Only our Tsinghua University has not yet found a suitable solution. Although this is due to the Ministry's cautious selection, we fear that unforeseen events may occur, making it difficult to deal with. Good intentions may lead to bad results, which is not your original intention in promoting education. Regarding the selection of a president, the student body's general assembly previously unanimously passed the following conditions: (1) Rich in educational experience, (2) Profound knowledge, (3) Well-established reputation, (4) Noble character, (5) Non-partisan, (6) Truly capable of developing Tsinghua. Based on these conditions, we recommend selecting one of the three gentlemen, Zhou Yichun, Zhao Yuanren, or Hu Shih. We have always believed that you are enthusiastic about education and concerned about the future of our university. Therefore, we dare to express our opinions and sincerely request that you grant our request and appoint a president as soon as possible. It would be fortunate for the party and the country, and fortunate for our university. As for the details, we believe Mr. Qian Changzhao has already conveyed them. All matters concerning the request for the swift selection and appointment of a suitable president to benefit the university's operations are respectfully submitted in writing for your consideration. We await your instructions. Respectfully presented to Chiang, Chairman of the National Government and concurrently in charge of the Ministry of Education."</p>
<h3>The Director of the Zhejiang Education Department Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chen Bulei sent a telegram from Nanjing to the Zhejiang Education Department on the 27th, stating that the newly appointed Director, Zhang Daofan, would arrive in Zhejiang on the 28th.

After receiving the telegram, the Education Department, although previously observing Japanese holidays, remained open as usual to handle the handover matters. Director Zhang Daofan arrived in Hangzhou around 1:00 PM on the 28th and stayed at the West Lake Hotel.

<h3>Peng Xiang Resigns from Labour University</h3>
<p>Since the new president of Labour University of this city was announced and someone is in charge, all staff and students of the university are grateful to former President Yi and have high hopes for the future of the university. Peng Xiang, the former chairman of the university council, secretary-general, and acting dean of the School of Social Sciences, announced his resignation and departure from the university yesterday due to exhaustion from his efforts in university affairs over the past two years. He also issued a notice to all faculty and students, stating that he had limited knowledge and felt ashamed for not accomplishing anything during his year at the university. He originally intended to retire during the summer vacation to avoid blame, but the university faced many difficulties and the president resigned. Seeing that the arduous efforts of the past three years were about to be destroyed, he had to temporarily maintain the university's operations. Fortunately, the university's foundation has been stabilized, and the new president has arrived and taken office. The rumors of "takeover," "shutdown," and "no president appointed" have not materialized. Therefore, the purpose of his previous tolerance and remaining at the university has been fully achieved, and it is time for him to fulfill his original intention, resign from his position, and leave the university. In addition to handing over university affairs to the new president, this announcement is hereby made. Peng Xiang, December 29, 1920.</p>

<h3>Liao Maoru's Statement Regarding the Guanghua University Incident</h3>
<p>Liao Maoru's statement regarding the Guanghua University incident is as follows:</p>
<p>Many discussions and declarations from various parties regarding the recent Guanghua University incident have involved me. My ambition has always been to study education. For the past ten years, I have never been involved in political issues other than education, nor have I published any articles. My friends and teachers know this well, so there is no need for me to argue. Even in terms of my dedication to education, I prefer teaching to administration. However, I have often been forced to do things against my will due to circumstances. I recall that when I first joined Guanghua in 1927, I reluctantly took the position of director of the affiliated high school. A year later, President Zhang Yongniang forced me to concurrently serve as vice president, and I repeatedly refused. Subsequently, I repeatedly requested to resign, but the president firmly retained me. During that time, I received invitations from Tsinghua University in Beiping, Zhongshan University in Guangdong, Central University in Nanjing, and the China-America Educational and Cultural Foundation, but I did not accept any of them. Last year, the position of director of the Chinese Education Department of the工部局 was already agreed upon, but it was stopped due to the president's insistence on retaining me. The following is a copy of my resignation letter from last semester:</p>
<p>"To President: I love Guanghua, and I also love myself. For the past three years, I have been working for Guanghua without considering everything. However, my health is weak. I have not left administrative life for a single day in the past ten years since returning to China. Recently, I have been taking care of both the university and middle school departments, and I feel even more exhausted and irritable. After participating in the National Education Conference in the spring, I suffered from coughing. At that time, I planned to ask the president to relieve me of some administrative duties, but the school was preparing for the fifth anniversary, so I did not want to speak up. Now that the academic year is coming to an end, the university and middle school departments have taken shape, and development is not difficult. However, my spirit has become increasingly exhausted. If I continue to force myself to support, it will not only not help the school, but also harm myself. Therefore, I sincerely request that the president approve my request for a one-year leave to rest at home or allow me to teach a few hours at Guanghua until my strength recovers, and then I will repay the school. During this semester, I have declined all invitations from various parties (Chen Bulei, director of Zhejiang Province, Central University, and Wuxi Public Education College have all sent letters). I have refused them all because I cannot betray Guanghua." June 8th</p>
<p>The president replied, "I received your letter from Jiading and learned everything. Guanghua's success today is all thanks to you. I value your friendship and believe you are the most sincere. Considering our daily interactions, I cannot bear to be indifferent. From now on, I will be responsible for all financial responsibilities and major difficulties, while the school's management and academic affairs will still rely on you. I sincerely hope that you will not give up. I will say more in person." June 11th</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, I thought that all private universities in Shanghai that have been registered are operating diligently and engaged in construction. Guanghua has a five-year history and a considerable reputation, so I should try to follow suit. Therefore, I overestimated myself and thought of staying for another year or two to work for Guanghua. I became more motivated and did not avoid hard work. After the incident, because it involved me, I decided to listen to the president's solution and left the school immediately. On the 13th, I formally resigned from the school. Regarding the list of expelled students published in the newspaper on the 16th, it was decided by a "six-person committee" organized by the president, and I did not participate in it at all. On the 15th, I received a reply from the president as follows:</p>
<p>"I received your letter and understood everything. The current dispute in the school is nothing more than a temporary emotional impulse of a few students, involving reports of facts. How can we not uphold justice and slander others? You have been working hard and bearing grievances for three years, and everyone knows this. You have repeatedly requested to resign, but I have firmly retained you. This is not the time to protect yourself. Please continue to serve in both the university and middle school departments. In addition to reporting the retention situation to the board of directors, I sincerely ask you to understand everything."</p>
<p>On the 16th, the school sent a letter of retention from the board of directors and a resolution of the board of directors as follows:</p>
<p>"Resolution of the Board of Directors of Guanghua University, 1:00 PM, December 16, 1920, at 10 Moore Road. Directors present: Wang Shengsan, Xu Xinliu, Yu Rizhang, Zhao Jinqing, Zhu Yinjiang, Yu Qiaqing, Wu Yunzhai, Shi Shengzhi, Lin (representing Lin Kanghou), Xin Zhi, Zhang Yongniang. Chairman: Zhang Yongniang. Recorder: Wang Yi. Report Matters: (1) The president reported on the recent dispute involving a few students. (2) The president reported on Vice President Liao's resignation letter and the retention situation. Resolution Matters: (1) Unanimously retained Vice President Liao and encouraged him to overcome difficulties. (2) All other matters concerning the aftermath of the school will be resolved by President Zhang."</p>
<p>On the 17th, I firmly resigned from the school again. This is the entire process of my involvement with Guanghua from beginning to end. All departments of the university and middle school have hired certified Kuomintang instructors. "The memorial week does not adhere to the prescribed time. The school motto can be improved. It was stipulated when Guanghua was first established that if it needs to be changed, it must be proposed by the president. In short, my personal departure is not a problem, and my reputation is not important. But right and wrong must be clear, and justice must be preserved. Therefore, I have briefly recounted the facts for the gentlemen of the country."</p>
<h3>The Dunhua Elementary School Founded by the Islamic School Has Been Completed</h3>
<p>Construction and Land Purchase Cost Over 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Stipulating that Free Students Account for Half of the Enrollment</p>
<p>The China Islamic Association purchased a plot of land on Qinglian Street and built the Dunhua Elementary School. After more than half a year of operation, the school building has now been completed. Classes will begin in early February next year, starting with the first four grades and gradually expanding to accommodate five or six hundred students. The cost of land, construction, and operation totals over 100,000 yuan, which was raised by the Islamic community itself. The school's annual expenses have a fixed income of approximately 4,000 yuan. The school pays attention to the education of poor children, so it stipulates that free students account for half of the enrollment. Although the school is run by Islamic individuals, students are not limited to Muslims and there are no religious courses, which is the same as ordinary elementary schools. The founders are well-known Islamic figures Ma Fuxiang, Ma Linyi, Ha Shaofu, Sha Shanyu, and others.</p>

<h3>Regulations of the Shanghai No. 1 Industrial and Commercial Football Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai No. 1 Public Stadium is organizing the Third Industrial and Commercial Amateur Football Tournament, which was previously reported.

<p>(15) The team may not protest on the spot during the competition or stop the game on any pretext.

However, the committee's decision is the final judgment, and the protesting team may not object again.</p>
<p>(16) These regulations are valid from the date of commencement of registration to the date of termination. If there are any omissions, the committee may propose amendments.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter   Hai Ke</h3>
<p>Plaintiff (to his lawyer): Thank you. You have handled my case well.</p>
<p>Lawyer: Yes. Please give me the legal fees as soon as possible to settle the matter.</p>
<p>Plaintiff: About how much will it cost in total?</p>
<p>Lawyer: Including conversation fees, correspondence fees, court appearance fees, etc., all included, it will be about one thousand taels. Your father and I are old friends, so I won’t overcharge you.</p>
<p>Plaintiff: Alas, that is my misfortune. Why weren't you old friends with my ancestors as well?</p>
<p>Old Pastor (asking a drunkard holding a bottle of brandy): Are you planning to finish this bottle of wine by yourself?</p>
<p>Drunkard: No. This bottle of wine was bought jointly with my friend. We each drink half.</p>
<p>Old Pastor: Drinking alcohol is very harmful. It is best for young people not to drink. Can you show that you have the courage to reform and pour your half of the bottle into the gutter by the side of the street?</p>
<p>Drunkard: That won't work. Because my half is in the bottom half of the bottle.</p>
<p>Carpenter: (Working on repairs on the roof of the asylum): Alright, alright. It's almost done.</p>
<p>Madman (sneaking out of his room and climbing onto the roof, suddenly grabbing the carpenter's collar): Hehe. Let's jump down to the street together, shall we?</p>
<p>Carpenter (terrified): Everyone can jump. That's nothing special. How about we go down to the street and jump up to the roof together?</p>
<h3>Words of Wisdom from Ma Junwu  Wan Cheng</h3>
<p>Dr. Ma Junwu, a renowned scholar with a doctorate in engineering from Germany, gave a speech on "The Spirit of Academic Research in Japan" at the Da Xia University Commemoration Week in late May. Having recently returned from his travels in Japan, Dr. Ma felt deeply and his words of wisdom should be recorded. (Excerpts below)</p>
<p>The Japanese use the newest methods of production and the oldest methods of consumption, while the Chinese use the old methods of production from the 16th century and the new methods of consumption from the 20th century. How can the people not be poor and the nation not be weak? The only way out is for the nation to strive to expand and reward investment in academic research. At the same time, it is hoped that the Chinese people will go to libraries and laboratories.</p>
<p>Chinese education is a diploma exchange. Ask students why they want diplomas, and they answer to eat and get a wife. Japanese students often stay in school after graduating from university to continue their studies, demonstrating a true spirit of learning. Dr. Ma Junwu will earnestly teach Chinese students this point and help save China's commercialized education.</p>
<p>Chinese students consider wearing Western suits and leather shoes fashionable, while Japanese students consider being simple and clean an honor. It was once said that a Chinese student studying at Tokyo Imperial University reeked of perfume one day, making people feel drunk. When he entered the laboratory, he was driven out by a Japanese student, who said, "You are like a vagabond, unworthy of academic research." This became a laughing stock for a time. This is also a wake-up call for young people. Japanese students study diligently, often forgetting to eat and drink. Chinese students should take this as a model.</p>
<h3>An Evening Chat About Oil-Based Photography   Jian Quan</h3>
<p>I have always liked photography, but I only know a little about it and have no opportunity to study it in depth. At the current fourth Hua She Exhibition, I saw several oil-based photographs. I felt that their light and color were very different from the ordinary and could not be described by ink and paper. I was eager to dispel my doubts. I used to live in Peiping and often saw large-scale Chinese paintings of landscapes and animals by Mr. Hu Boxiang. His brushwork was superb, powerful and extraordinary, far beyond what contemporary artists could achieve. Recently, I came to Shanghai, and through the introduction of a friend, I had a chance to meet Mr. Hu. So I went to visit him and was received. At that time, Mr. Hu was working on a painting of a fierce tiger under the lamp, and Mr. Zhu Shuren was also present. I was overjoyed because both of them had oil-based photographs on display in this exhibition. I was given a detailed explanation and recorded it as follows for the benefit of fellow enthusiasts. (What the two gentlemen said below.) The term "oil-based" is not very appropriate. It should be called the Mo paper oil color method. Any ordinary enlarged photograph can be used for this. First, put it in bleaching solution to bleach the image, then fix it and dry it. Then you can apply the oil application procedure. Before applying the oil, soak it in clean water at a temperature of about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The length of soaking time depends on the softness and hardness of the gelatin on the surface of the enlargement paper. After removing it from the water, lay it flat on damp blotting paper and use a clean, damp handkerchief to absorb the moisture from the surface of the paper. Then you can use a special brush to dip the oil color on the tip of the brush and apply it. If you need to reduce the oil color, you can use another brush and lightly tap it to remove it. This kind of surgery is something that anyone can do well as long as they are brave enough to try. The most valuable point is that you can add or delete things from the scenery. However, the danger is also here. If the author lacks aesthetic sense, the result will be a hundred mistakes, and it is better to enlarge directly. Photography is like writing and painting. It is not a masterpiece just because you use famous paper and famous pens. Therefore, the most important foundation of photography is still to promote aesthetics and express individuality. Its structure, color, etc. are also important points. If you focus on a part of the procedure or think about the materials, even if you reach the peak, you are only an ordinary technician in the photography industry. Today, photographic art is very popular internationally. In exhibitions in various countries, many famous works are made using the oil application method. It is even more popular in France and Italy. According to what we know, there are Zhang Zhenhou, Wang Shilian, Lang Jingshan, Gao Mei, Shen Gao, Wang Dafo, Guo Xilin, Xu Junshan, and my younger brother Bozhou who have a deep understanding of this art. This is a clear sign that interest in the domestic photography community is growing.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes from Sichuan   Hu Tiannong, Sent from Sichuan</h3>
<p>After the death of Tan Yankai, the military and political circles in Sichuan all mourned him passionately. Wu Peifu, who had been hiding in Sichuan for a long time, also wrote a couplet and sent it to the central government. The upper part was inscribed "Brother Zu'an, may you rest in peace." The lower part was boldly inscribed "Your brother, Wu Peifu." The couplet reads: "The road to Shu is difficult, the apes in the Wu Gorge cry tears. In Changsha, I mourn bitterly, the wild geese returning to Hengyang bring several letters." The feelings are evident in the words. Wu is probably the saddest person today.</p>
<p>Also, General Yang Sen, stationed in Qu County, is also extremely passive. He occasionally composes poems, which are quite sad. The poem reads: "The wind and rain hasten the early autumn, the military uniform reminds me of the passing years. My army is poor to the bone, staying here for a long time, I am afraid I will make a home. Thinking of flying geese, I wave my pen like an old crow. Occasionally, I stand upstairs and watch the slanting smoke."</p>
<h3>A Record of the Plum Blossom Song and Dance Troupe   Zheng</h3>
<p>The Plum Blossom Girls' Song and Dance Troupe, led by troupe leader Wei Yingbo, went to various ports on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to try out new sounds. Wherever they went, their reputation was unprecedented. Recently, they performed at the Municipal Hall on Nanjing Road, and the performances were very popular. Yesterday, I had a little free time and was able to feast my eyes. I will record a few things for the readers.</p>
<p>Flexible like boneless. The excellent dance "The Dying Swan" is extremely difficult to express. Ms. Zhang Qi of the troupe is the best at it. The most commendable thing is that she is graceful and agile. She can raise one foot to her head, and she can also bend her head back to the ground. All of these have reached the realm of perfection.</p>
<p>Flower troupe clusters. This dance involves 12 participants and is purely Western in style. It is directed by Mr. Klarin, a Westerner. Every move is extremely beautiful. Among them, Qian and Zhong Xiu are the most distinctive. Their dance posture is the most unique. Commentators say that the Flower Troupe Clusters dance is the greatest success of the troupe.</p>
<p>"Long Remember" is a song that contains a sense of sadness. The song is not difficult, but it is not easy to convey emotions. Minghui's reputation in the past was based on this. On this day, Zhang Xianlin sang the song clearly, without dance, which added to the quietness. Her voice was as exciting as a warrior going to war, thunderous, and as sad as a cuckoo crying in the middle of the night, deeply touching people. She is indeed a talented woman.</p>
<p>Little Painter. Little Painter is a famous play in the dance world recently. In this troupe, Gong Qiuxia plays the painter, and her performance of the innocent state is perfect. Cai Wenjin and Yang Zhenbiao, the teachers, are especially funny. The applause never stopped at the end.</p>
<p>Celebrate the New Year. This performance at the City Hall has been going on for ten days. It is said that 7,000 to 8,000 yuan have been sold from the 20th to the 27th. The attendance is not weak. The meeting was originally scheduled to end on the 29th. On the 24th, the important officials decided to continue the performance for five days, until the 3rd of the 20th year. A temporary program was arranged. From the 29th to the end of the year, they will perform "Moonlit Night", "Spring Happiness" and ten new songs and dances. From New Year's Day to the 3rd, at the request of all walks of life, they will re-perform "Seven Emotions". The Wuhu Star Theater also hired the Plum Blossom Troupe to perform on stage from New Year's Day. They had no choice but to draw members who had recently been recruited into the troupe with a little foundation in singing and dancing, supplemented by a few old troupe members, to fulfill the contract with Wuhu. Therefore, the performances were limited to plays such as "Little Three Butterflies". In Shanghai, "Seven Emotions", "Li Yantao" and other large song and dance dramas are still being performed. It is said that the Republican Theater will also be performing "Seven Emotions" and other programs on the stage of the Plum Troupe from the 10th to meet the requests of those in Nanshi who love to watch singing and dancing. The magic power of "Seven Emotions" is so great. I know that Ms. Yingbo and Mr. Cai Wenjin, the authors of the play, must be very happy about this.</p>
<p>Short message. Guo Xiaoping, Li Daoxi, and Ni Qiuping are all famous erhu players in Shanghai. Their achievements are vast and broad, and they are known as the Four King Kongs of the time. Recently, the three gentlemen established the China National Phonetic Society and specially hired experts from Peiping to manufacture famous musical instruments for the benefit of fellow enthusiasts. Mr. Li is especially meticulous in the selection of piano materials and the method of matching them. It is as if Yang Baozhong is in the middle of the peace. It is now heard that the opening is scheduled for early next month. Those who want exquisite musical instruments should pay attention. The address of the society is located in the center of the racecourse on Fourth Road in the British Concession, downstairs in the vegetable society. (Piano fans)</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (346)  Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Cui Xiu Visits Mr. with Diligence to Ask for Words, Qinglou Banquets Female Heroes with Generous Talk of Soldiers</p>
<p>Who knew that after the person who invited the guests returned, he shouted downstairs, "The guest is coming." Since he said that the guest was coming, she would naturally come. All the guests sat upright, waiting for the arrival of this Chinese-German female hero. In less than fifteen minutes, there was a sound of leather shoes on the stairs, and a person walked up and asked where Luyi's room was. The people in the room quickly shouted, "Here, here." The guest strode in, but she was wearing a sapphire blue iron-patterned men's robe. Although the cheongsam worn by women has gradually become popular now, that kind of cheongsam does not have slits at the bottom. There are also fashionable people who make the cheongsam very short, only three or four inches past the knee. However, many people oppose wearing cheongsams because the Xinhai Revolution opposed and overthrew the Manchu Qing government. It has a bit of racial revolution. The Han people were uneasy and depressed for a long time because foreigners entered the Central Plains. This time, they wanted to vent their anger. Therefore, they wanted to overthrow the Manchu system. But isn't the cheongsam worn by women still a Manchu system? Then why should our dignified Han people learn from it? So at that time, wearing cheongsams was not yet popular. Women all wore short skirts. However, like Ren Peizhen today, she refused to claim to be an ordinary woman. She wanted to be like a man. She also wore a man's robe, but she didn't add a jacket or anything like that on the outside. At this time, it was also very fashionable for women to wear men's clothes. Just like Luyi, she often wore men's clothes. Her body was originally petite, and she wore a men's robe. She also wore a vest on the outside, with inlaid ruyi heads around it. She wore a Western-style casual hat on her head, which was also very charming. Not only Luyi, but also many hall waiters were dressed like this.</p>
<p>However, although Ren Peizhen wore a man's robe, she did not wear that kind of Western-style hat. She still had a bun. Looking at her bun, it was indeed a bit unique. It turned out that during the Xinhai Revolution, some aspiring women also had some revolutionary spirit. That revolutionary spirit started with the bun. The bun was combed on the head and neck. In the Qing Dynasty, the buns of women were indeed a bit unsightly. There was a kind of bun combed on the neck. They thought it was charming, like the so-called falling horse bun in ancient times. Some people said that kind of bun was a bit demonic. There was also the kind called the cool bun. The idea was to be simple, but if you were not careful, your hair would fall down. In that year of the revolution, women became popular with a forward bun. They combed their hair on the corners of their foreheads. Some also combed their hair on the top of their heads. At that time, some people also called it the fighting bun, which meant that no matter how much you fought with others, your hair would not fall down.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Nanyang (116)   Hua</h3>
<p>People in India and Burma eat a lot of sour and spicy foods, such as onions and garlic, and betel nuts are especially popular.</p>
<p>Most of the livelihoods of the Burmese people depend on the export of rice, but now the British limit exports, saying that they want to maintain the livelihoods of the poor. The Chinese people say, "No, this is cutting off the financial resources of the Burmese people, fearing that their wealth will be active and unfavorable to the British." If rice exports are cut off, all financial resources will be stagnant and undeveloped, which is also one of the reasons for the decline of commerce. Also, because gold is expensive and the cost is high, the export price of rice is high and difficult to sell. The locals suffer losses as a result. Many Chinese people in Burma run machine rice mills, called rice grinders. Their capital ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions.</p>
<p>The climates of the various islands in Nanyang are different due to the different locations. They do not know each other. Taking Burma as an example, there are three seasons. According to the ancient calendar, from April to September is the rainy season, which is very suitable for hygiene. From October to December is the winter season, which is rainless and warm, with a slight chill, making it the most suitable time for work. All industries and commerce are booming at this time. From January to March, it is extremely hot and rainless, making it the least suitable season. The three seasons in Burma are roughly like this. As for what is usually called the rainy season, it only refers to whether it rains or not.</p>
<p>I advocate international openness and cooperation, with intermarriage as the center. Because all problems, physiology is the first. When physiology and bloodlines are assimilated, everything else will be different. In the past, Mr. Kang of the South China Sea recruited a poor scholar as his son-in-law, saying that this was also a method of communist regulation. This can be inferred from this. A friend told me that you advocate international intermarriage to harmonize all nations. Now, the Min and Cantonese people in Nanyang intermarry less because of language. However, in order to harmonize the Min and Cantonese people, we should also promote intermarriage between Min and Cantonese people, which is one way to combine the large group.</p>
<p>Nanyang is born of mixed races. The meaning of mixed races here is to express welcome, which is the opposite of what is often used in China to criticize. I have seen many children born to Burmese women and Westerners. They are very proficient in English. There are also many poor people, probably because their fathers died and they were displaced. Burmese women are intelligent and beautiful, so people from all countries often marry them. The attitude of Burmese women is probably better than that of Japanese women. Burmese people love beauty. Even the rural male laborers wear red shirts, full of rice fields, without raggedness and filth. Compared to the people north of the Huai River, they are far more elegant. Most people put flower pots on their doors, which is very elegant and clean. When female empowerment is popular, everyone will know how to love beauty, and the violent air of masculinity can be reduced day by day. I will use Burmese customs to predict it. Burma can be called a flower country, but why is China not as good? It is still possible south of the Huai River, but why is the north so degenerate?</p>

<h3>Gold Speculation Reaches New Highs</h3>
<p>Breaking through the 70 tael mark. Yesterday, gold speculation rebounded to a new high, almost breaking through the 670 tael mark again. However, the market situation was hesitant and complex, with hidden fluctuations of two or three taels from time to time. The front and back markets had a total difference of five taels. Looking back, the foreign exchange market was particularly weak, but the listed price did not change. Although the transactions of various firms in the market were active, there was not much volume. Firms such as Taikangrun, Yongheng, and Yuanmaoyong generally had more demand than supply, while sellers such as Yuanheng, Fuchang, and Yufengyong were also present. The overseas silver market was quiet, but the gold price had opened high, and the trend was upward. However, the sudden rise and fall were caused by the increase or decrease in buying and selling, and the state of uncertainty was confusing. The later market was generally flat, with strong buying interest from the Guangdong group and those hedging goods. Yuanheng, Yufengyong, and retail investors sold slightly. The foreign exchange market was tight and difficult to obtain, and the market sentiment was strong. The market seemed to be advancing thousands of miles, and finally, 71 taels were suddenly found, which was a new high again. It is said that large bars may see lower prices this morning.</p>
<p>The market had already opened high in the morning. The opening price for June was 664 taels and 6 qian, an increase of 1 tael and 1 qian (the gross price was around 65 taels, and trading was still active). There was no market for large bars, and the silver price did not change. However, private telegrams (28th) had already gone down by a small 1/16th. The exchange rate did not change. Then, because of sales from retail investors, and the Dalian group also slightly divested, it returned to 63 taels and 5 qian. Before long, Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, and Xiyu came in and returned to a high of three taels. Only a little over one tael fluctuated. When the first order was posted, the listed price did not change, and it was 66 taels and 7 or 8 qian. The domestic market was strong. The Bank of China and Korea mutually made British gold 1525. Huabi absorbed Dalian's spot at 1 tael, 4 qian, 1 fen, 875 li, and Taikangrun and others bought in, and it rose again to 8 taels and 4 qian. Yuanheng and Zhifengyong came to sell and went back a little over one tael, 7 taels at 9:50, and Citi sold 34 yuan and 875 li for the March contract through a broker. Then Huayi and Mitsui offered 34 yuan and 8125 li. The market situation turned tight, and Taikangrun, Xiyu, and others chased in, and it was difficult to settle British gold at 1525. Therefore, at 10:15, it rose to 68 taels and 7 qian. Afterwards, Tongtaichang, Fuchang, Yuanheng, and those hedging all sold, and the price gradually declined. However, it fluctuated by a little over one tael from time to time. Until 11:15, it was only 64 taels and 6 qian. The buyers in the market were unhappy, and the sentiment seemed low. Suddenly, it rose again. Sumitomo absorbed British gold 1525 for April, and Dalian offered to sell at 1 tael, 4 qian, 1 fen, 75 li. In addition, Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, and others had all bought in, so it was 67 taels and 4 qian at 11:50. At noon, the market closed and retreated to 6 taels and 4 qian, because Yuanheng and retail investors sold out. The market situation was volatile, and the price fell as soon as it was sold. The listed price was still 691 taels and 2 qian, a difference of over 24 taels, to about 25 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The later market felt more acute. The afternoon market opened at 66 taels and 7 qian (the gross price was about 6 taels, 3 or 4 qian to 7 taels). Then, because the telegram for Indian exchange had gone down by 4 anna, it rose to 67 taels and 2 qian. Afterwards, there was a difference of one tael between the two. After 2:30, retail investors sold, and the March British gold contract could be settled at 1525, so it had fallen by one tael. At 3:20, it was 66 taels and 1 qian. Afterwards, a high figure suddenly appeared. Mitsui and others absorbed Dalian's spot at 1 tael, 4 qian, 1 fen, 875 li. Also, the March British gold contract had a favorable absorption of 1525. Liangtian, Dadecheng, Wupin, and Hengfeng came on the market to drag in, and the market suddenly became acute. At 3:50, it was 68 taels and 2 qian. At this time, Yuanheng and others sold, suppressing it by one tael. After 4:00, the situation was good again. The March British gold contract was only settled at 151875. The banks' intentions were very strong, and Hengxing continued to buy in, jumping two taels. At 4:30, the market closed at 68 taels and 9 qian, an increase of 5 taels and 4 qian compared to last Saturday, a small fall and a big rebound. After entering, it went high again by two taels, and actually exceeded the 70 tael mark. Wupin bought a lot, purely of a hedging nature. It had been to 71 taels, which was unexpected. The maximum during the day was 68 taels and 9 qian, and the minimum was 63 taels and 5 qian, a difference of 5 taels and 4 qian (according to the listed price). For prices above 69 taels and 2 qian, the exchange did not collect the closing accounts, so the firms had to handle it themselves. Wupin was 4 taels and a half in the early market, 6 taels and 3 qian at noon, 6 taels and 8 qian in the afternoon, and 71 taels at the close. The listed price was suppressed by a little over 24 taels to within 23 taels. The accounts were registered at 63 taels to 66 taels, and the water was replenished at 63 taels in the afternoon at 66 taels.</p>
<p>There was still no large trading volume. Among the trading firms, Taikangrun, Yongheng, Yongfeng, Yuanmaoyong, and Xiyu all bought in. Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, Yuantai Wanxing, and Shunli had fluctuating ins and outs. Yuanheng, Yufengyong, and Fuchang all sold out. Wupin bought in and sold out again. In the afternoon, Yufengyong, Yuanheng, Yu Da, and Yuanmaoyong all sold out. Dadecheng, Hengxing, Wupin, and Wanxing all bought in. Zhifengyong and Shunli had occasional ins and outs. Yongheng and Yongfeng bought in slightly. However, none of the firms had large transactions. The Dalian group sold a total of 700 to 800 bars, and the same was true for buying in. The Guangdong group bought a total of 400 to 500 bars.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Flat in the Morning, Tight in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no telegraphic transfers in the British, American, and Indian silver markets. The HSBC listed prices for all exchange rates did not change. However, the domestic market was flat at first and then sharp, especially tight in the afternoon. The gold market rebounded to a high of five or six taels, and it was known that it had seen a high price of over 70 taels again. Therefore, the market sentiment suddenly opened up and progressed. By the afternoon close, compared to last Saturday, the British gold contract had shrunk by .0625, the American gold contract had shrunk by .1875, and the Japanese gold contract had risen by .75. The Chinese gold industry seemed to want to settle, but the banks were unwilling to sell lightly. 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded. Sumitomo, Mitsui, and others all had ins and outs. The banks mutually traded tens of thousands of pounds. 500,000 to 600,000 yuan of American gold were bought in. Banks such as Mitsui, Huayi, Chase, and Pangen all sold out. The Dalian group sold over 1 million yuan of Japanese gold because the market price was higher than in Dalian. Mitsui, Huabi, Sumitomo, Korea, and others all bought in. In the afternoon, Korea once made a one-month Japanese-American exchange rate of 49 yuan and 625 li.</p>
<p>The British exchange domestic market had .0625 highs and lows. In the morning, the prices for near and far terms were 1 shilling and 5 pence and 25,000, and buying was 3125. The noon close was flat. The afternoon close was also priced at 1875, and the buying price was 55.</p>
<p>The American exchange domestic market had .125 ups and downs. In the morning, the prices for near and far terms were 34 yuan and 9375 li, and the buying price was 35 yuan and 0625 li. The closing price was 34 yuan and 8125 li, and the buying price was 9375 li. The American exchange domestic market had 75 differences all day long. In the early market, the one-month price was 1 tael, 4 qian, 1 fen, 875 li, and the March price was 1 fen and 75 li. The buying price was reduced by 375 li to half a fen. The noon close price was 1 tael, 4 qian, 2 fen, 25 li, and the March price was 2 fen and 125 li. The afternoon close price was 1 tael, 4 qian, 2 and a half fen for January, and 2 fen and 375 li for March. The buying price was reduced by about half a fen.</p>
<h3>Overwhelmed Collection and Settlement of Silver and Money Industries During the Closing Days</h3>
<p>Even More So Towards the End of the Year</p>
<p>Accurate Securities Delivery and Settlement Also Complex</p>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday was Monday, and since the customs had been closed for several days prior, all procedures had to be sorted out yesterday. Therefore, the situation was unique. It was decided that the year-end settlement of accounts and repayment of loans would be carried out in two phases this year; otherwise, it would be even more difficult. Moreover, the monthly routine securities delivery and settlement also had to be carried out yesterday. As a result, the collection and settlement of both silver and foreign currencies, as well as transactions, were busier than ever before. Due to this reason, all news could not be investigated and reported in detail as desired due to the inconvenience and time constraints, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates (Foreign Currency): The early morning exchange rate was 7.24875 cents. In the afternoon, it suddenly increased by 0.625 cents to 7.255 cents, resulting in an increase of 0.5 cents compared to the previous day's afternoon rate. (Silver Exchange): The early morning rate was 8 cents, the same in the afternoon, seemingly better by 0.2 or 0.3 cents compared to the previous day. However, there was still no added water and the transactions were done with "white strokes."</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Market Conditions: The early morning transaction price for small Jiangnan silver coins was 6.57 cents, the same price in the afternoon. The early morning transaction volume was 3,000 *jiao*, with no transactions in the afternoon. The early morning price for small Guangdong silver coins was 6.5875 cents, and the afternoon price was 6.59 cents, seemingly up by a small 0.5 cents.</p>
<p>The early morning transaction volume was 125,000 *jiao*, and the afternoon volume was 55,000 *jiao*. Copper coins contracted by 2,000 strings, to 368,000 strings.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Currency Inflows and Outflows: Yesterday's silver and foreign currency collection and settlement, regardless of banks or money houses,</p>
<p>Various routine procedures had to be extended in time due to the excessive amount of work. Therefore, the report was drafted when it was only halfway calculated and could not be reported in detail. According to industry estimations, the silver public bills collection and settlement was at least over 50 million, and the foreign currency public bills collection and settlement was between 10 and 20 million. The bank's account settlement and collection was even more complex, estimated to be over 6 or 7 million. It was reported that the collection and settlement of remittances from various routes exceeded 800,000. The market trade for opened remittance drafts was 4,015,000 in the morning and 2,769,000 in the afternoon. The trading volume in both markets was as high as 6,780,000, which was also a particularly busy event. This was mainly because yesterday was the date for the current month's securities delivery and settlement, and the settlement amount this time was indeed more than double the usual amount, hence this phenomenon. There were no transactions in the banknote market. The off-market transactions were 224,000 in the morning and 110,000 in the afternoon. The bank's interbank transactions were 1.3 million in the morning and 850,000 in the afternoon. Since all banks and foreign accounts had to be settled and collected, the collection and settlement was naturally scarce. However, since the total settlement amount could not be fully investigated, this kind of incidental collection and settlement could not be investigated either.</p>
<h3>Securities: Yesterday's Public Debt Delivery and Settlement Situation</h3>
<p>The amount totaled 29.38 million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange handled the public debt futures delivery and settlement for December. Market trading was suspended. The total amount of debt delivery reached 29.38 million yuan, an unprecedentedly large amount. On Friday of last week, 19.265 million yuan had already been cleared. The amount actually delivered yesterday was still 10.115 million yuan. Among them, 6.8 million yuan was for the "19" issue, about 5 million yuan for demobilization and troop reduction, and also about 3 million yuan for the "19 Good" customs tax. The delivery and settlement went smoothly. The delivery and clearing amounts of each debt are listed in the following table (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>Debt Type  Clearing Amount  Delivery Amount Total Delivery</p>
<p>Entire Six  745,000 365,000 1,110,000</p>
<p>Year Seven 150,000 95,000 245,000</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The December Yarn Delivery Situation</h3>
<p>And the past of its entire market course</p>
<p>The mark prices in December were quite unstable at the beginning of the month. The overall situation was weak, the sales of yarn were sluggish, the stock was increasing daily, and the market was trending downwards. A certain manufacturer had 7,000 to 8,000 bales of stagnant stock in hand, and due to insufficient strength, it was difficult to maintain and was in a state of shaking. Later, all the short sellers bought in and hedged in the market, and the market atmosphere suddenly became weak. The selling trend was relatively strong, and new low prices were found in each month, falling from 142 to 143 taels to 135 taels and 5 *qian*. Not long after, the year-end settlement problem could be delayed by one and a half months, so actual sales gradually became active, and prices turned hard. Furthermore, the matter of the factory tax was very... above, and there was much discussion in the business community, and the market situation became increasingly tense. Later, the factory tax was implemented on January 1st, and the customer gangs made a large number of transactions, and the development of the situation was surging. All gangs urged the spot goods to be shipped quickly, before the 1st, to reach the destination to avoid tax silver of 6 or 7 taels. Therefore, the business was exceptionally prosperous, people's hearts were excited, and the buying atmosphere was strong. Money house gangs bought in to arbitrage, and the general public competed to go long. Therefore, the rising wind became more and more fierce, and the highest ever reached 145 taels and 1 *qian*. The resulting delivery price was 143 taels. The total delivery volume was 8,800 bales, with 4,100 bales of self-delivery and 4,700 bales of actual delivery, including 1,450 bales of 20-count Five Blessings, 1,750 bales of Shepherd, 600 bales of 10-count Earth, and 300 bales of 10-count Three Sheep. The recipients were mostly small retailers. The brand names and bale amounts of the delivering and receiving parties are recorded on the left:</p>

<h3>The Whole Story of This Month's Cotton Delivery</h3>
<p>Delivery price 33 and a half taels :: Quantity 36,100 *dan*</p>
<p>Recipients Long Companies :: Deliverers Han Gang and General Retailers</p>
<p>The situation of the marked cotton in December was sluggish at the beginning of the month. The world cotton industry was still in decline, buyers were scarce, the spot cotton trade was sluggish, the factories were saturated with printed cotton, and the need was completely stagnant. The majority were psychologically shorting, but the buyers were determined to go long as the standard was set high and there was a shortage of high-quality goods on the market, the Han Gang also seemed to go long, and the source was not prosperous. The short-selling retailers were in the majority, so the buyers turned short and their attitude was firm. In addition, the goods could not be inspected for several days at the end of the month due to customs closure, and the squeeze became more intense. The price at the beginning of the month was 31 taels and 7 or 8 *qian*, the lowest being 31 taels and 3 *qian* and a half, and the highest reaching 35 taels, exceeding the spot price on the market by more than 3 taels. This kind of situation was rare. Therefore, there was a storm on the upper day standard in January, and a request was made to the market to re-examine the standard. The standard remained in stalemate for two or three hours before the auction began. The resulting delivery price was 33 taels and 5 *qian*. The total delivery volume was 36,100 *dan*. The goods were Shaanxi fire machine, the recipients were long companies, and the deliverers were the Han Gang and retailers.

<h3>The Consumption Power of Spot Yarn is Strong</h3>
<p>Purely because of the tax exemption relationship</p>
<p>Yarn sales of 1,700 bales The mark yarn was closed for one day due to the end-of-month delivery matters, but the market atmosphere was still firm, the sales of spot yarn were still smooth, and the customer gangs were still interested, so people's hearts were stable. Most gangs were urging the loading of spot yarn and transporting it to the destination as soon as possible to avoid tax. If the factory tax can be postponed, there is still a large hope for the development of spot goods. If it is the opposite, temporary or fixed, in short, it is difficult to see the market falling for a while. According to statistics, the total number of bales bought by various gangs throughout the day was 1,700 bales, and there were also 500 to 600 bales of transactions in the afternoon, which have not yet been recorded. Among the customer gangs, Sichuan entered 325 bales, Ningbo Gang entered 45 bales, Shantou entered 150 bales, Guangdong Gang entered 175 bales, Luzhou entered 55 bales, Xuzhou entered 70 bales, inland entered 420 bales, Hankou entered 255 bales, Wuhu entered 50 bales, and miscellaneous gangs entered 130 bales. The market conditions were similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>It is difficult to break the stagnant situation of cotton to remove the stomach. The future cotton market was closed due to the end-of-month delivery</p>
<p>One day, the spot cotton trade was still sluggish.</p>
<p>Shaanxi cotton 33.00 Hengfeng Factory entered 1,400 pieces of spot goods and sent them to the factory</p>

<h3>Grain: The Rice Market Turns Stable</h3>
<p>In Zhabei, each gang arrived with about twenty number of sources yesterday, and the sales were uneven. The buying atmosphere for white *geng* turned weak, and high-quality goods were particularly rare, with slight fluctuations. Medium and lower quality goods had some differences. The overall trend was not easy to decline because the source was still not cleared, so the market price was uniformly stable. The arrival and sales of *bao dao* were both sluggish, and the price remained at the original level. The *yang du xian* high-quality goods were rare and popular, while the medium-quality goods were sluggish and the overall atmosphere fluctuated greatly. The port tips were weak and barely level, and the *bian yuan* lacked high prices and the stomach was not happy, and the price was weak. The *yin yuan* high-quality goods were stable, and ordinary goods were sluggish and few transactions, especially the *bai yuan* should be at 13 yuan 34 *jiao*.</p>
<p>The number of ships arriving in Shanghai South yesterday was still scarce, and the street sales were not very</p>
<p>Refreshing. White *geng* was tight in the morning due to the remaining wind from the previous day. Following the news from the north that the price was flat and tending to stabilize, the Changzhou and Wuxi gangs saw that it was stable, and the retail sales of Suzhou and Tongxiang *geng* were poor, and the market dropped slightly. The arrival and sales of *bao dao* and early rice in the south were both sluggish, and the stock was abundant, and the market price was stable. The *yang du* tips that arrived were going smooth and the market was slightly firm. The high-quality goods were at about 12 yuan. The *bian yin yuan diao fang* saw activity again, but the price was not easy to shout high.</p>
<h3>Allowing Japanese Rice to be Sold in Shanghai Said</h3>
<p>Guest *xian* arrival and sales both vibrated</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of guest *xian* was stable, and not many arrived. The street continued</p>
<p>There were sales. Although the guest gangs have been suspended for a long time, there are few arrivals and stocks on the market, which are only enough for the street to inquire. Therefore, the market was able to stand firm. Yesterday, the street still handled 1,000 bags of Jiangxi machine early rice, priced from 10 yuan 6 *jiao* and a half to 10 yuan 3 *jiao*. 200 bags of Hunan machine oil rice, priced from 11 yuan 3 *jiao* and a half to 13 yuan 3 *jiao*, and 500 bags of red rice, priced at 9 yuan 4 *jiao* 7 *fen*, and 200 bags of Ji Jing rice, priced at 11 yuan 1 *jiao* and a half, all similar to the previous market prices.</p>
<p>The Japanese rice that arrived in Shanghai a month ago has not been sold due to other reasons. According to news from a certain source yesterday, the rice can be sold on the market today or tomorrow, because the market authorities have received orders from Nanjing to allow it to be sold in Shanghai. Therefore, it</p>
<p>It will definitely be seen in the market today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Black Melon Seeds in Zhabei are Selling Well in Fujian</h3>
<p>Since the market price of black melon seeds has rebounded, the sales in Fujian have been active.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 bags have been handled before and after, with prices ranging from 10 taels to 11 taels. Therefore,</p>
<p>The market trend continues to rise. For example, the *dangshan zi*, which was opened at 10 taels and a half in the previous market, is now quoted at 11 taels by the number house, and the price of Dalian seeds has risen to 11 yuan 3 or 4</p>
<p>*jiao*, which does not match Shanghai, and the source is lacking. Yesterday, the market quotation was as high as 12 taels 7 or 8 *qian* for Jizhong seeds, 10 taels and a half for Xukui seeds, and 11 taels for *dangshan zi*, followed by 10 taels to 9 taels and a half. The market is stable and elegant.</p>
<h3>Sea Food Accumulation of Fin Production Reduced and Prices Increased</h3>
<p>Ningbo Small Fin Price Expensive and Sales Sluggish</p>
<p>Accumulated fin production areas are lacking raw materials, resulting in a sharp reduction in shipments and soaring market prices. In addition, there is demand from customer gangs, and there is a risk of running out of stock in the market from time to time. Thirteen boxes were shipped by the port to various stalls. Yesterday, the selling price was 715 taels for Sanfu Indian dragon beard accumulated fin, 668 taels for Shuangfu Indian fin, 466 taels for Jinshan top fin, 384 taels for large fin, and 320 taels for medium fin. Compared with the market in early last ten-day period, each stall has increased by 20 to 30 taels. Moreover, the bank is very interested in entering the market, and the back market may rise again.</p>
<p>Small shark fins from Japan have been scarce for a long time due to the high exchange rate and high costs. The domestic Ningbo fins have been harvested quite abundantly this year, but the high market prices inevitably make customer sales sluggish. The current selling price is 135 taels for whole-tail raw dried fins and 92 taels to 85 taels for whole-piece fins. However, sales to the Han gangs are still strong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea British Firms Actively Run Factories</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British sales of silk in the foreign firms of this port gradually started. Yihua silk firm, last week's negotiation on the transaction of Central Chinese body white factory silk was successfully concluded</p>
<p>Yesterday morning after the Christmas holiday. A total of 160 bales of Central Chinese body silk were traded, and the price was only 800 taels. Each manufacturer was unwilling to announce the silk brand because the price was too low. Xinfu entered 30 bales of upper body gray silk, and the price was also not strong.</p>
<h3>Russian Firms Open Red and Green Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Russian Aid Society in Shanghai resumed searching for Qimen black tea and Gongxi green tea. However, the stock of the above-mentioned black and green tea is only 10,000 to 20,000 boxes. In this autumn of high gold prices, tea prices in various countries are too expensive, and the market price of Chinese tea is uniquely low. Many Russians purchase Chinese tea, considering it a good strategy. However, yesterday, the Russian firms quoted only about 30 taels for Qimen tea, which was more than 10 taels lower than the wishes of Chinese merchants. Negotiations have not been able to approach. The price of Gongxi green tea can also be negotiated today. However, black and green tea merchants are well aware of the large sales volume of Russian firms and are unanimously determined not to lower prices for sales.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Each Goods Sells Surprisingly Smooth</h3>
<p>The market of the local factory rose consistently yesterday and the momentum was very strong. It is actually due to the fact that the factory tax is about to be implemented and the Gregorian New Year will require a few days of rest,</p>
<p>There cannot be shipments for a while. Therefore, the needs of local customers are surprisingly smooth. Fine cloth sold another four to five hundred pieces yesterday, and the price rose another five *fen* to one *qian*. *Yanghe* was six taels eight *qian* and a half, *caiqiu* was six taels eight *qian*, *lan shuangyu* was six taels eight *qian* two and a half *fen*, and *lanji* has also reached six taels six *qian* and a half. Fine twill *yanghe* also requires seven taels, *lan shuangyu* six taels eight *qian* and a half. In addition to the street padding in, the rough cloth has a very smooth military demand route. The thirteen-pound *shuangma*, *magou* are consistently out of stock, only *shuangying* has opened six taels. Eleven-pound *santou*, *sanlu*, *sanmao* are all four taels seven *qian* and a half. Rough twill is also firm, sixteen-pound *wuyuanbao* is seven taels six *qian* two and a half *fen*, fourteen-pound *renta* is out of stock, and *sanyu* sells for five taels two *qian* two and a half *fen*.</p>
<p>Each market of East-West piece goods has risen sharply. The customer's need is the most seen in this year. The import tax has been set to increase on January 1, and the gold market has not stopped rising. The price of goods will definitely skyrocket in the future, so the sales are surprisingly smooth. The inventory of East goods is about to be empty. Each peer on the street has one to two hundred pieces of goods shipped out. The Sichuan, Hankou, Qingdao, Kaifeng and other gangs on the customer side continue to purchase continuously, resulting in soaring prices. Yesterday, *zhigong ni* rose five *li*, *lieyan* three *qian* four *fen* seven and a half *li*, Moganshan three *qian* four *fen*, Yipin Fugui three *qian* two and a half *fen*. There is still no stock of Changbanqiao. The 100 pieces of Huxinting and 200 pieces of Longhu of Yuehua velvet that arrived have been completely sold out as of yesterday. Fine serge has also been rising frequently, and each brand has increased by two and a half *li* to five *li*. West goods are also firm, bleached cloth rose two *qian* to three *qian*, and Yuan Yuchou rose about five *qian*.</p>
<h3>Boiled Water American Rain Cloth Suddenly Rises One *qian*</h3>
<p>Single-sided boiled water American raincoat cloth, the sales in the market were smooth again yesterday, and the buyer's needs are strong again, so the selling price continued to rise by one *qian*. The stock of Shen cloth is lacking, and after searching again, it feels even more squeezed. Yesterday, the wholesale price had to be sold for 4 taels 1 *qian* and a half per yard. The tailor shops in the door shop calculated 6 yuan and 2 *jiao* in foreign currency. It is difficult to find those who want to sell Yuan color and gray, even if they add another *jiao*. It is actually because the stock has gradually been sold out. Although there will be arrivals next month, the opening price will definitely be more expensive. The foreign firm has set a huge amount of 6 shillings and 4 pence, which is known to the industry. If calculated with the exchange ban ticket, the cost is still not enough.</p>
<h3>Non-Ferrous White Lead Skin Market Gradually Improves</h3>
<p>Because there are few white lead skins near the sea, various gangs are very embellished, so the trend has gradually improved. For example, No. 2 is estimated at 26 taels, No. 3 is 25 taels and 5 *qian*, No. 4 is 24 taels and 7 *qian* and a half, No. 5 is 23 taels and 5 *qian*, No. 6 is 22 taels and 5 *qian*, No. 7 and 8 are 22 taels, No. 9 is 23 taels, and No. 10 is 2 taels. However, the recent foreign exchange is very small, and people's hearts are uneven, so the standard is also 5 *qian* to 1 tael different. It is heard that more than 20 barrels were opened yesterday, and the buyers were tea shops and gangs.</p>
<h3>Small Divided Nail Price Rises 2.5 *qian*</h3>
<p>Recently, the small divided nails have been arriving less and the trade is prosperous, resulting in a shortage of supply on the market. In addition, the foreign exchange has plummeted, and people's hearts are more solid, so the market has risen by another 2.5 *qian*. It is estimated that 3 points are sold for 12 taels and 5 *qian*, 4 and 5 points are 11 taels, and 6 points are 9 taels 2 *qian* and a half. It is heard that there were more than 160 or 70 barrels opened yesterday.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Forgives China National Aviation Corporation</h3>
<p>No Further Investigation into the Unauthorized Flight Incident</p>
<p>British Newspapers Recorded Falsehoods and Agreed to Correct Them</p>
<p>Before Chairman Chiang of the National Government left Wuhan to return to Nanjing, he had previously booked an aircraft from China National Aviation Corporation, intending to take the aircraft from Wuhan to Nanjing. On the morning of Chiang's departure from Wuhan, the aircraft flew away an hour earlier without authorization, resulting in a temporary change to take a warship. This matter was detailed in the Hankou telegrams a few days ago. When Chairman Chiang came to Shanghai, he saw that the local English-language *Great Evening News* reported that Chiang had arrested Mr. Kirk, an employee of China National Aviation Corporation, for this matter, and stated that the company's branch office in Wuhan had been closed. This was obviously inconsistent with the facts. Song Ziwen was ordered to negotiate. Yesterday morning, Song entrusted Liu Yunfang of the Foreign Affairs Office to report the denial to the *Great Evening News* and ordered a correction. The newspaper agreed to comply. It is heard that Chairman Chiang was magnanimous and did not investigate the unauthorized departure of the aircraft. However, he expressed dissatisfaction with the company's negligence. Yesterday morning, Liu personally went to China National Aviation Corporation at No. 3 Guangdong Road and invited Mr. Hamilton, the company's Western manager, to Song's office to accept questioning. Song met at the Guohuo Bank on Hankou Road, inquired about the process, and ordered the company to formally apologize in writing.</p>
<h3>The Three-Province Bandit Suppression Headquarters</h3>
<p>Was Completed Yesterday</p>
<p>The Files Will Be Shipped to Nanjing Today</p>
<p>The Three-Province Bandit Suppression Headquarters of Jiangsu, Anhui and Zhejiang received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, ordering its abolition. The headquarters was originally attached to the Songhu Garrison Command. Since receiving the order, personnel from various departments have rushed to complete the winding-up. Yesterday, various official documents and files were categorized in one place and the winding-up was completed. It was decided to send personnel to the Nanjing General Headquarters to clear the procedures. Most of the staff are part-time, so there is no need to dismiss them.</p>
<h3>Port Authority Handover Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Port Authority, by order of the Executive Yuan, has temporarily suspended its establishment and, according to the order of the Municipal Government, will be closed by the end of this year. All its functions will be taken over by the Bureau of Public Utilities, the Bureau of Land Affairs, and the Bureau of Public Works. Details have been previously reported. Yesterday, the Port Authority completed its closure, and the Municipal Government, together with the three bureaus, went to take over. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Takeover Situation: Yesterday at 10:00 AM, personnel from the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Land Affairs, the Bureau of Public Works, and the Bureau of Public Utilities went to take over. The Municipal Government was represented by Qi Xuan, the head of the First Section, who, along with staff members, took over the files and equipment of the Port Authority's First Section. The head of the Port Authority's First Section and others handed over the items one by one. The Bureau of Land Affairs sent staff members such as Sheng Kai to take over matters related to the management of the shoreline, which were handed over by the Port Authority's Second Section. The Bureau of Public Utilities, led by Secretary Xu Yuanfang, along with staff members, took over the wharf management office and the sand dredging boat registration office. The director of the management office, Xu Shipu, accompanied them to the Bund to hand over the operations. The Bureau of Public Works was represented by Tan Wenqing, the head of the First Section, who led staff members to take over the dyke works office and the dredging of waterways, which were handed over by the Port Authority's Second Section.</p>
<p>However, the sand dredging boat registration office is located far away in Wusong, and the dyke works office is also in Gaoqiao. The Bureau of Public Utilities and the Bureau of Public Works were unable to reach these locations yesterday, so the takeover is scheduled for today.</p>
<p>Renaming of Two Offices: The Wusong sand dredging boat registration office and the Nanshi wharf management office, which will be taken over by the Bureau of Public Utilities, will be renamed the Shanghai Wharf and Warehouse Management Office and the Wusong Shipping Office after the takeover. The office locations will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Staff Placement: Now that the Port Authority has completed its closure, the salaries for the staff this month were distributed by Director Xi Dingmo yesterday morning. Regarding the placement of staff members, personnel from the sand dredging boat registration office, the dyke works office, and the Nanshi wharf management office will remain in their positions as usual. Other staff members within the Port Authority will be assigned to various bureaus for employment, depending on the circumstances. Director Xi Dingmo has already been appointed as a Municipal Government Advisor. It is reported that those who cannot be placed will have their severance pay requested from the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Naval Department Sends Personnel to Take Over the Naval Reorganization Office</h3>

Apart from Ren Guangyu being appointed as an advisor, Wang Jun, He Boxiong, and Zhang Zanjian as staff members, and Chen Maoxian as an adjutant, there are no other placement arrangements yet.</p>
<h3>Removal of Chen Dezheng from the Municipal Executive Committee</h3>
<p>Vacancy to be filled by Huang Xuchu</p>
<p>| The Municipal Executive Committee notified all districts yesterday |</p>
<p>Chen Dezheng, an executive member of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, has been detained in connection with a case and has been officially removed from his position by the Central Government. The vacancy of the executive member was resolved at the 76th Standing Committee meeting of the Municipal Executive Committee yesterday, using a lottery method to determine that alternate executive member Huang Xuchu would fill the vacancy. It is reported that reports have been submitted and notifications sent. The notification document from the committee to the district party departments is as follows: This order is to inform you that Chen Dezheng, an executive member of this committee, has been officially removed from his position by the Central Government. The vacancy of the executive member position is because the votes for Hou Dachun and Huang Xuchu were the same when they were elected. After submitting to the Central Government for instructions, it was decided that a lottery method should be used to determine the winner. In accordance with this, a lottery method was used at the 76th meeting of this committee, and it was decided that Comrade Huang Xuchu would fill the vacancy as an executive member of this committee. In addition to submitting a report to the Central Government for record and distribution, this order is to inform the district party department immediately. This is the order.</p>
<h3>Judicial Yuan Interpretation of Tenancy Relationship</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of renovating houses</p>
<p>In recent years, disputes between landlords and tenants have arisen frequently in this city regarding tenancy issues. Cases of coercion and eviction often occur. Landlords, on the other hand, argue that their property rights should not be compromised. As a result, these issues often become social legal problems. According to a report from the Xin Sheng News Agency in Beijing, the Judicial Yuan recently issued instruction No. 1177 on December 23, 1920, to the Jiangsu Higher Court, requesting an interpretation of a case where a tenant renovated a rented house at their own expense without setting a specific term. The question was whether the tenant could be ordered to move out at any time. This has significant implications for rented houses in this city. The hypothetical scenario and instructions are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Hypothetical scenario: Party A rents a house to open a large-scale store. Because the original building was simple and dilapidated, Party A obtained Party B's consent and invested their own funds to renovate several Western-style houses on the land, totaling approximately 50,000 yuan in construction costs and 18,000 yuan in miscellaneous expenses. Party A continued to rent the property. However, the contract did not specify a lease term. After only a few years, a business in the same neighborhood, whose landlord was also Party B, offered a large amount of money to induce Party B to force Party A to move out. They secretly agreed that the business would invest a certain amount in Party B's business. Party B used the pretext of self-use to force Party A to move out. The handling of real estate is the owner's right, and tenants cannot be allowed to occupy it forever. However, landlords who forcibly evict tenants must also consider the facts and the regulations in Section 5 of Article 230 of the old Civil Code on obligations regarding lease agreements. Protection of the rights of the tenant is particularly thorough. Article 450 of the newly promulgated Civil Code states, "If no time limit is set, either party may terminate the contract at any time, but if there is a custom that favors the tenant, the custom shall prevail." This also takes into account the interests of the tenant. Party A has already spent a large sum of money to renovate the new house. After only a few years of completion, they are being asked to move out, and the cost of their entire business and house construction will be completely sacrificed. This not only violates custom (in Shanghai, there is a custom that landlords cannot force tenants to move out within ten years if the tenant has invested their own funds to build the house) but also goes against reason. Self-use must also have necessary circumstances. Merely investing in someone else's existing store is a joint venture, which is different from self-use. If this becomes a precedent, the tenant's entire business will not be protected, and it will harm society. Weighing the law and the facts, we request the court to provide a fair interpretation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Judicial Yuan's response: Having received the case, we have forwarded it to the Supreme Court to prepare a proposed interpretation and submit it for review. It states that if a tenant invests in renovating a rented house and the landlord is aware of the situation but does not express any objection, and if the lease contract does not specify a term, the landlord may terminate the contract at any time. However, if there is no special agreement regarding the renovation costs, the landlord shall compensate the tenant for the existing increased value of the house when the lease relationship ends (refer to Article 431 of the Civil Code). If the lease contract does not specify a term, according to Article 450, paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, if there is a local custom regarding the termination of the contract that restricts the landlord and favors the tenant, the custom shall prevail. Having carefully reviewed this, we find no discrepancies. This order is hereby issued for your information.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy Went to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Case between China and Japan is expected to be resolved immediately</p>
<p>Japanese Acting Minister Shigemitsu Aoi was originally scheduled to go to Beijing tonight to participate in the New Year's Day military parade in the capital. However, due to other important matters requiring prior negotiation in Beijing, he specially sent Counselor Hayashi Ide and Chen Shiguang, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, to negotiate. He temporarily changed his trip to Beijing to 11:00 PM last night. It is reported that regarding the Ningbo case between China and Japan, he had previously met with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting in Shanghai and reached an agreement. He requested instructions from the Japanese government and received a reply yesterday. He urgently needs to go to Beijing to negotiate with Foreign Minister Wang.</p>
<h3>British Envoy Arrived in Shanghai the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Going to Hong Kong by ship today</p>
<p>British Minister Lampson arrived in Shanghai late on the 28th, heading south from Ping. Accompanying him were his daughter and the couple Mr. and Mrs. Fibers, who were temporarily residing in the British Consul-General Brenan's residence. It is reported that he will take the British Company's Lanxi steamer to Hong Kong on the 30th and continue his travels to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Naval Department Orders Ship Owners to Add Gun Emplacements to Ships</h3>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Adds Four Seas Liners</p>
<p>Made in the country to show promotion</p>
<p>The local shipping companies received a dispatch from the Ministry of Communications forwarded from the Naval Department, stating that merchant ships can be used as auxiliary naval vessels in times of war, which is a common practice in various countries. When constructing these ships, it is necessary to prepare for the installation of artillery, so the hull must be strong and the speed must be increased to be applicable. Although the construction is convenient for navigation, the cost of shipbuilding will inevitably increase. Traditionally, the government provides subsidies according to the price, so that rights and obligations are equally divided. Recently, state-owned merchant ships have been used to meet the temporary needs of the navy, such as the Queen's Wheel of England and the Presidential Wheel of the United States. This demonstrates the intention of your ministry to revitalize navigation and prepare to reclaim navigation rights. At present, various countries have signed international conventions on maritime safety, stipulating that old ships must be modified and new ships must meet construction procedures. As the trend of the times, all countries believe that it is more convenient to build new ships than to modify old ones. China's shipping industry is just emerging, and it is very important for your ministry to add new ships at this time, which is enough to make a new impression. It seems that we should not buy what others discard. The two shipyards, Jiangnan and Mawei, under the jurisdiction of our ministry, built many ships of more than 10,000 tons for the US government during the European War. Now we have ordered the factories to prepare the shipbuilding procedures in detail. Domestic shipbuilding can be labor-saving and inexpensive, and can compete internationally. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's north-south routes need to put in place four new ships of 3,000 tons each. This type of coastal ship is most suitable for 3,000 tons. Although the bureau is state-owned, it is a commercial enterprise. For temporary military purposes, the Ministry will discuss subsidy methods for all increased construction costs. If agreed, the Ministry will order the departments to design, draw, and estimate prices, and prepare a plan, which will be discussed by the two ministries, aiming to proceed in a timely manner, so that the military and business can benefit.</p>
<h3>British Police Arrest Indian Trespassers</h3>
<p>Indian Youth League Protests</p>
<p>Da Wan Bao reported that an Indian named Xin Nanxin escaped from the isolation ward of the police station yesterday (28th) and fled to Zhabei. He was arrested by the Chinese police. As of this afternoon (29th), he is still detained at the Zhabei Police Station. According to personnel from the Public Concession Police Station, they will ask the Public Security Bureau to extradite him for interrogation today. Xin had previously been arrested with another Indian, Ka Taixin, on the 3rd of this month for distributing leaflets at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road. On the 5th, he was sent to the British Police Court for trial. Ka pleaded not guilty in court and stated the justice of the Indian people's call for independence. Xin remained silent. At that time, Xin was charged with three counts: drunkenness and disturbing public order, privately possessing a pistol, and distributing inflammatory writings. In addition to the first two counts, which were sentenced to imprisonment, the third count was still pending transfer to the Office of the Provincial Judge for trial. Recently, Xin became ill in prison and was transferred to an isolation hospital for treatment. He took the opportunity to go to the bathroom at 6:00 AM on the 28th and escaped through the window. He fled to Zhabei and took refuge in an Indian church. When detectives from the Public Concession, accompanied by officers from the Public Security Bureau, went to arrest him, the people in the church were agitated and difficult to offend. Later, the Chinese police arrested him near Zhenru. The Indian Youth League has written to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest against the five British police officers and two Indian informants from the Public Concession, who, without Chinese police officers, armed themselves and entered the league's office at 241 Baoxing Road, drawing weapons. They then went to the Indian church to arrest Xin Nanxin. It is claimed that they used guns to threaten Xin Nanxin with handcuffs and then tried to handcuff those who were campaigning to restore Xin's freedom. The Indian comrades closed the church door and locked the five people indoors, forcing them to release the illegally arrested comrades before letting them go. At that time, two British men outside the door ordered the five people inside to shoot and kill the comrades. Not long after, three Chinese policemen went to arrest Xin Nanxin, who was immediately arrested without resistance, because we live in the Chinese district and of course recognize Chinese law. The letter also requested that Xin not be extradited to the Concession Police Station.</p>

<h3>Foreign Affairs Discussion Meeting to Discuss Water Price Increase</h3>
<p>Invite Experts to Participate in Discussion</p>
<p>The issue of the Public Concession's water price increase caused a great storm previously due to the company's tough attitude and sudden cut-off of the water source. Later, the Municipal Council agreed to invite experts and consultants to discuss the matter in detail with the Public Utilities Committee next year before making a final decision. Therefore, a temporary conclusion was reached. It is now reported that the Foreign Affairs Discussion Committee believes that this issue is of great importance to the rights and interests of the concession residents, and that the Chinese side should conduct a detailed study before the meeting of the Municipal Council, so as not to dig a well when one is thirsty. Therefore, it has been decided to propose a discussion at the 33rd Standing Committee meeting on January 9th next year, and specially invite the secretary of the Taxpayers Association, He Dekui, the specialized committee member of the association, Tao Leqin, and the municipal expert Dong Xiujia, to attend.</p>
<h3>Completion of the May 30th Massacre Family Association</h3>
<p>And Report on Income and Expenditure Accounts</p>
<p>The May 30th Massacre Victims' Family Association previously requested the Municipal Council, through directors Yu Qiaqing and others, to allocate all the 150,000 yuan of compensation funds to the board of directors, together with the Family Association, to distribute to the families of the victims of the May 30th Massacre.

<h3>The Government Silk Industry Requests Attention to the Raw Material Wild Silk Tax Rate</h3>
<p>The Fu Silk Guild sent a telegram to Zhang, the Director of the Customs Department of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating that the Fu silk produced in Shandong, Andong, and Henan is woven purely with wild silk and is sold exclusively to foreign countries. It is one of the exported native products. Recently, the wild silk material produced in Liaoning and Ning has been absorbed by the eastern neighbor, accounting for six or seven tenths of the total amount. They rely on their low export tax from South Manchuria to compete with our country in sales to Europe and the United States, and have already been almost completely taken away. It is requested that the Ministry carefully consider the tax rate, reduce the tax rate on raw material wild silk domestically, and appropriately increase the export tax. It is also requested that the export of Fu silk be exempted from tax, according to the tea leaf precedent. In addition to sending a special letter of request, this telegram is sent. The Shanghai Shandong Henan Silk Industry Office respectfully states.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Requests Strict Prevention of Kidnapping Cases</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent letters to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the two Concession authorities, requesting strict prevention of kidnapping cases within the boundaries. The letter stated: "To whom it may concern, it has been found that cases of kidnappers abducting people for ransom in this city have occurred frequently in recent years. Although the authorities have made great efforts to investigate and apprehend them, this trend has not been curbed slightly. Recently, several cases have occurred in a single sentence, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries, which is shocking and appalling. The rampant forces of bandits are unprecedented. The prosperity of this city depends entirely on commerce. In such a situation where travelers are wary and people cannot sleep peacefully, not only is personal safety and property not guaranteed, but the future of commerce in this city will also be indirectly undermined. This was brought up for discussion at the 26th Standing Committee meeting of our association, and it was resolved that the authorities of this city should be requested to make every effort to prevent and strictly investigate such cases in order to protect public security. We hereby record the case and send this letter to your bureau for verification and immediate implementation, in the spirit of public friendship."</p>
<h3>Yang Fengnian Telegram to Shanghai Seeking Relief</h3>
<p>Zhen Bing Arrives in Longyan to Preside Over Relief Efforts</p>
<p>The Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai yesterday received a telegram from Zhang Zhen, Brigade Commander and Commander of the Anti-Communist Frontline, Yang Fengnian, as follows: "To the Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, all newspaper offices, all levels of party departments, all societies, all chambers of commerce, and all charitable organizations: Western Fujian and more than ten counties have been brutally ravaged by the Communist bandits. Social economy has been completely destroyed. There have been many deaths, and the survivors are haggard and helpless. The survivors are destitute and have nowhere to go, with lamentations heard everywhere. Even Zheng Xia's painting of refugees cannot fully depict the tragedy. Fengnian was ordered to suppress the Communists and returned to Longyan. Wherever the troops went, the scenes were shocking and alarming. In between military affairs, he asked about the suffering of the people, but unexpectedly found that the people were so haggard. Appeasement and consolation are not enough to help without funds. He has invited Mr. Gong Dingming to come to Longyan to preside over all charitable undertakings, so that leadership is in place and implementation is easier. Fengnian will soon advance his troops to Tinghang and knows well that the situation in various places suffering from the Communist disaster is no different from that in Longyan. The tragic situation is self-evident. The disaster area is vast, and the need for funds is huge. In this severe and cold winter, the disaster victims, supporting the old and leading the young, stand helplessly in the fierce wind and rain, suffering from hunger and cold, and living like years. We hope that the authorities, fellow countrymen, and gentlemen will raise large sums of money and allocate them for distribution. A drop in need is like sweet rain. Trembling with fear upon sending this telegram, I respectfully request your consideration. Army 49th Division Anti-Communist Frontline Commander Yang Fengnian bows deeply."</p>
<h3>Disputes Involving China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Vessels All Concluded</h3>
<p>Tonghua Incident Resolved</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tonghua vessel had seamen beaten by workers and crew members arrested in Qingkou, and dockworkers went on strike. These incidents were reported in this newspaper. Now, it is learned that the company telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting the Ganyu County Magistrate to release the arrested crew members to maintain operations and facilitate transportation. After two telegrams urging action, Haizhou has now replied, stating that the Ganyu County has concluded the investigation of this conflict. Both the seamen and the workers were injured. The county has ordered the Tonghua vessel to pay a fine of 300 yuan to be used as medical expenses for the eight injured workers. At the same time, the labor union was ordered to resume work as usual from today. Both parties agreed, and the Tonghua case has come to a temporary conclusion. The arrested crew members and the headmen of the stokers and watermen were released yesterday and returned to the ship.</p>
<p>Haiyan Case Adjudicated</p>
<p>On April 25 of this year, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyan vessel sank three wheat barges and drowned a boatman at the Jinliyuan Wharf. The victims filed a lawsuit in court, and the owner of the Haiyan vessel specially hired lawyer Wang Naimu as defense counsel. The case has now been concluded. The charge of manslaughter brought by the victims was dismissed, but a fine of 500 yuan was imposed for negligence in business operations. The judgment has been delivered, and it is reported that an appeal is planned to argue for the cancellation of the fine.</p>
<p>Replacement of Crew Members</p>
<p>In order to rectify the qualifications of crew members, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company believes that all members on various vessels who do not have certificates from the Ministry of Communications are unqualified. After investigation by the shipping department, it was found that one member in the navigation department and eight members in the engine department did not have certificates from the ministry. They have been ordered to resign, and the company has appointed members with certificates from the ministry to fill their positions from among the reserve navigators and engineers. It was heard yesterday that the nine members who were dismissed have registered with the Ministry of Communications and applied for certificates for commercial vessel personnel.</p>
<h3>Lide Oil Factory Reopens Yesterday</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Suspends Labor Union Activities</p>
<p>In November, short-term workers at the Lide Oil Factory in Tanzhiwan, Zhabei, demanded a wage increase without success, resulting in a labor dispute. The factory director, Liu Changyin, decided to temporarily close the factory due to excessive losses caused by the workers' slowdown. Fortunately, the Social Affairs Bureau mediated and decided to increase the wages of each short-term worker by one yuan, and then work continued. Before a month had passed, long-term workers went on strike together with those aware of the issue because of the rice subsidy issue. The factory could not withstand the losses and announced a shutdown again on the 18th, while applying to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for fair mediation. It is reported that the Bureau has approved the factory to dismiss the seven workers who initiated the labor unrest as a punishment, and ordered them to start work again soon. Furthermore, because the factory's labor union had not been re-elected for three years, it was deemed necessary to thoroughly reorganize it. Therefore, the labor union was ordered to hand in its seal and license and temporarily suspend activities, pending reorganization. It is also said that since receiving the approval from the Social Affairs Bureau, the factory reopened yesterday, but the remaining long-term and short-term workers have not yet returned to work.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Pays Attention to the Mixed Sale of Diseased Livestock Meat in Concessions</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau has assigned qualified veterinarians to inspect livestock and the sale of livestock meat in the city. Any diseased or dead livestock or diseased meat found will be detained and sent to rendering plants to be rendered into oil for industrial use, in order to prevent harm to the health of citizens. Subsidies will also be issued to the owners of the items, so as to express condolences. However, if there is private slaughtering or private sale of diseased or dead livestock meat, once discovered, the Public Security Bureau will be requested to impose severe penalties to deter others from following suit. Because the Health Department of the Public Concession has already followed the urging and carried out post-slaughter inspection, but nothing has been heard about how to dispose of diseased or dead livestock and diseased meat, the Bureau has specifically written to the Health Department of the Public Works Department of the Concession to inquire about disposal methods, and informed them that if there is no proper disposal method, the diseased or dead livestock from the racetrack dairy farm or slaughterhouse can be ordered to be sent to the oil rendering plant in the south of the city for rendering, and subsidies will be issued to prevent mixed slaughter and sale, and to emphasize the safety of meat products consumed by citizens within the boundaries. The Municipal Council of the Public Concession then replied, stating that it was deeply appreciative of the suggestions of the Municipal Health Bureau, and that the Municipal Council was also well aware that the current disposal of dead livestock was not entirely appropriate, and that it was currently carefully considering ways to improve it as soon as possible. However, in the shortest possible time, the current disposal methods could not be changed. The Municipal Health Bureau believed that the current improper disposal methods had already been reported in the past, and that it was said that there were no changes that could be made, allowing the sale of diseased and dead meat to be sold openly, abandoning the responsibility of maintaining public health. A further letter was sent urging that improvements be made as soon as possible, and that there should be no collusion with unscrupulous meat merchants to allow them to privately transport diseased meat into the jurisdiction of this city for mixed sale, so as to fulfill their responsibilities and emphasize the health of citizens.</p>

<h3>The Trial of Hu Die's Lawsuit Against the Ling Bao Newspaper</h3>
<p>The Eloquent Arguments of Both Lawyers</p>
<p>The Verdict: A Fine of Three Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Lu Yifang Appeals</p>
<p>Hu Die, a female actor in the Mingxing Film Company, had a dispute with her fiancé, Lin Xuehuai, over the cancellation of their engagement. Lu Yifang, the editor of the three-day Ling Bao newspaper, published an article entitled "Hu Lin Divorce Record," which stated that Hu had been a prostitute and relied on others to become a small star. Hu believed that the newspaper intentionally defamed her reputation and instructed lawyer Zhan Jifeng to send a letter requesting a correction. However, the Ling Bao newspaper attached the phrase "Everything Heard is Recorded" to the correction and published a photo of Zhu Fei, a male actor in the Mingxing Film Company, in the next issue, with the words "A Key Figure in the Xue Die Divorce." Hu further believed that this was a deliberate attempt to damage her reputation and filed a criminal self-accusation with the Special District Court. It had been summoned and the defendant Lu Yifang was ordered to pay a bail of five hundred yuan to guarantee his appearance for further interrogation. This was detailed in the previous report. Yesterday afternoon, the trial resumed. Around two o'clock,</p>
<p>The audience members arrived one after another The Third Tribunal of the Special Court, was filled to the brim. Those who arrived later were all standing, crowded and unbearable. Then, Judge Feng Shide took the seat and first interrogated a case of a Westerner beating a Chinese person, after three and a half hours, he began the interrogation of the Hu Die lawsuit against Lu Yifang. Lu declared that</p>
<p>Witness Xie Hequn had been invited Feng Judge interrogated according to Xie's statement, currently working as a freelance writer, came to Shanghai from Wuxi on the 26th of last month, because Lu Yifang was a friend, the next afternoon, went to the Ling Bao newspaper to visit Lu, Lu wanted to return to Wuxi, entrusting me to temporarily take his editorial position, took over the job on the 28th, Lu at the time told me that if there were manuscripts submitted from the outside, each issue will have enough submitted manuscripts, if it is about</p>
<p>Manuscripts on the current situation must be taken seriously. I co-edited four issues. The Hu Lin manuscript was also submitted by others. The original manuscript was mostly in an affirmative tone. I deleted and revised it before publishing it, but the original manuscript was kept by the proofreader, whether it exists or not, I really don't know, until Lu returned on the 7th of this month, I then handed over the agency task, so I don't know anything about what happened after that. According to Lu Yifang's statement, the manuscripts during my return to Wuxi were not kept by anyone and have all been lost, but I told Xie at the time that I would write my own稿件, such as insufficient to adopt the submitted稿件, and must be reviewed, and did not tell him to publish all the submitted稿件. According to</p>
<p>Ling Bao proofreader Xu Xiaoqian stated that the Hu Lin manuscript has been lost. As for the photo of Zhu Fei published in the eighty-second issue of Ling Bao, I took it when laying out the edition because there were not enough manuscripts. It happened that the printing house had this copperplate, so I took it and published it to fill the blank. The words "Key Figure in the Xue Die Divorce" were also written by me, the editor did not know, and there was no intention whatsoever. Then the debate began, first by the plaintiff lawyer Zhan Ji鳫 stated that this case was because the Hu Lin incident occurred after the termination of the engagement,</p>
<p>All the newspapers published this news Defendant Lu Yifang, twice went to the plaintiff's home, and met with the plaintiff's father, the first time was also to interview news, the second time expressed his willingness to assist the plaintiff to attack Lin, and asked for subsidies of two or three hundred yuan, Hu Die's father refused, the defendant then tried his best to damage the plaintiff's reputation in the newspaper, this is the result of failed extortion, his defamation is the most serious, including pointing out the plaintiff</p>
<p>Once was a prostitute and also a small star, both falsely accused of having a relationship with people, etc., not only makes the plaintiff discredited, hurts the job, but also cannot be placed in society, livelihood reputation, of course, will be greatly affected, so the newspaper was sent a letter, requesting correction, but the eighty issue did not correct, but in the eighty-first issue, made a disloyal correction, no different from proving that the seventy-ninth issue was true, unexpectedly in the eighty-third issue, again published Zhu Fei's photo, pointing out as a key figure in the divorce,</p>
<p>Spitting blood to make people difficult And the defendant strongly argued that he was not in Shanghai at that time, this layer has been proven, Ling Bao has never disclosed a word about the Hu Lin marriage change,</p>
<p>Actually respecting the plaintiff's personality Now the plaintiff accused of defrauding property, is self-decoration, not credible, and Lu went to Xi, the duty entrusted to Xie, and Xie Qin had no small newspaper editorial experience, saw the outside submitted about the Hu Lin manuscript, he because society is very concerned about this matter, then the manuscript was published, without any intention,</p>
<p>According to the law, there is no intentional behavior without criminal responsibility, and negligent loss is not subject to criminal responsibility, requested to declare the defendant innocent, followed by Zhang lawyer辩称, the plaintiff accused of extortion, the defendant considers奇耻 in disgrace, must request thorough investigation, as to the published manuscript, the plaintiff considers诽谤者, only风尘小星 four words, according to the classics, Tang has 风尘 three heroes,</p>
<p>The two words风尘 are not slanderous As for 小星 two</p>
<p>Words, also in the Book of Songs, 嚖彼小星, three five in the East, it is the ancients chanted the meaning of officials working hard day and night, not slanderous words, according to the publication law, the published if untrue, once corrected, is not responsible, this is a special law, there are special laws in the regulations, should be based on special laws, do not need ordinary criminal law, today the defendant</p>
<p>Has made a correction Please judge innocent Lawyer Zhan refuted it again, As Lawyer Zhang said, then the newspaper can arbitrarily fabricate謠, once others send a letter to inquire, then give correction, and use the publication law as a protection, to overthrow criminal law, the双方辩毕, Feng Judge immediately判决Lu Yifang毁损 other people's reputation,罚金 three hundred yuan, such as易科监禁, to two yuan to offset one day</p>
<p>Lu heard the判决after declaring dissatisfied提起上诉, Feng Judge then命 him to pay five hundred yuan铺保,</p>

<h3>Three Ships Run Aground on the Yangtze River in One Day</h3>
<p>Water Level Drops:: Navigation Difficult</p>
<p>The Xing Shi Wheel of the Xing Shi Sanbei Company was leased by the Transportation Department for service. Last month, its engine was damaged in Pukou. The company sent technicians to Beijing to repair it. This time, the ship was sailing to Hankou. Due to the large drop in the river water, the Xing Shi Wheel ran aground on a shoal six Hua Li downstream of Bujia Town due to the receding tide. At that time, it was impossible to leave the shoal. Both the Shanghai and Hankou bureaus have been urgently telegraphed to send a wheel to tow.</p>
<p>The Bei Fu, of the Northern Shipping Company, which usually sails along the coast line, was carrying salt from Haizhou to Hankou this time. Unexpectedly, the ship ran aground near the Xiaogushan lighthouse ship. This area has hidden reefs and shallow sands, making it the most difficult for wheels to navigate. The Bei Fu ship mistakenly sailed onto the shoal, and the ship also ran aground. It is not yet possible to leave the area and a ship must be sent to tow it. It is not yet known whether the bottom of the ship has been damaged.</p>
<p>The Da Zhong wheel of the Heng'an Company in this port had a telegram from Shanghai yesterday, saying that the ship ran aground about six miles downstream of Anqing at a place called Yaojiawan. It was found that the river surface in this area was newly measured. The Da Zhong wheel ran aground because it was not clear about the river channel. The Shanghai Bureau is now trying to send a ship to rescue it. Whether there is any damage will only be clear after it is out of danger. Recently, the Yangtze River waterway has been shrinking day by day, so sailing is very difficult. Three ships were wrecked in one day, which is indeed unfortunate news for the Yangtze River.</p>

Recently, the Japanese fishing boat Takekyu No. 1 came to the waters outside the mouth of the Yangtze River in our country to fish. At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, when the boat was working near Huaniaoshan Island, Chen Jingcai, a Chinese helper on the boat, was operating the motor winch. The wire attached to the winch suddenly became tangled. Chen kicked it with his foot, but inadvertently his foot became entangled in the wire, which wrapped around it four times. By the time others stopped the winch, Chen's leg bones had already been broken. He immediately fell and died. The boat owner, Tamachito, ordered the boat to sail into Shanghai at 10:00 AM today, temporarily docking at the Xiang Sheng Iron Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong. He also sent someone to report to the Water Police Station. The police chief ordered detective Cheng Yongnian to rush to the scene and bring the body back to the police station. In the afternoon, it was transferred to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall Rescue Bureau, pending an autopsy by the local court. It is reported that the deceased was 26 years old and from Rongcheng County, Dengzhou Prefecture, Shandong Province. His body will be collected by his friend Bao Wenyi.</p>
<h3>Verdict on the Case of the Russian Dancer's Leg Injury</h3>
<p>Petri Pays 800 Yuan in Compensation</p>
<p>A Russian man, Petri (transliteration), injured the leg of a Russian woman, Yasutoro Huai, with a gunshot on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession last month due to emotional distress. The police arrived and arrested Petri, sending him to the French Court for questioning. Both parties retained lawyers to argue their cases. The court announced the end of the debate and that a verdict would be issued. Yesterday, the police station summoned both parties. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced the defendant Petri to two years in Western prison, suspended for three years, permanent expulsion from the Concession, and compensation to the plaintiff for losses amounting to 800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Police Chief Dismissed for Car Accident</h3>
<p>Westerner Hits Chinese Woman</p>
<p>Police Chief Fails to Detain</p>
<p>Ineffective in Duties</p>
<p>Zhao Laiying, a 16-year-old woman from Jiangbei, was suddenly hit and knocked to the ground by a car with license number 4704 driven by Ai Wusheng Wusheng (transliteration), a Westerner residing at No. 360 Haig Road, in front of the Citibank building on Great Western Road in Hongkou at around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. The foreigner, seeing that he had caused an accident, gave the injured woman's sister five yuan and then attempted to escape. Zhang Mingyang, the police chief of the Great Western Road police station, a branch of the second division of the sixth district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, learned of this, rushed to stop him, and sent Zhao to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. Fortunately, her injuries were minor, and she was discharged after being bandaged. The foreigner Ai Wusheng Wusheng signed a statement and drove away. Zhang reported the above situation to the station chief, Liu. Chief Liu was furious upon hearing the report, as the road was built beyond the border and all exercise of authority should be given special attention. Now the foreigner had injured a Chinese woman, treating human life like a game, and even attempted to escape, disregarding the law. Yet, the police chief Zhang Mingyang only relied on a signed statement, failing to detain the foreigner and instead releasing him privately. Fortunately, the woman's injuries were minor. Otherwise, who would be responsible if he fled to the Concession after signing a statement? Yesterday, Chief Liu submitted a report to Director Yuan, dismissing the police chief Zhang Mingyang as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Tragedy as Grandfather Takes Grandson to the Theater</h3>
<p>Grandson Run Over and Killed by Car</p>
<p>Chen Kaihe, a man from Taizhou approaching the age of knowing his destiny, rented a house at No. 66 Dongxing Road, Dithaway Road, and made a living pulling rickshaws for the Feixing Company on Jiaxing Road, accumulating some wealth. Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, Chen took his grandson A'bao to the Ning Stage on Auka Road to watch Yangzhou opera. Around 5:00 PM, after the play ended, A'bao suddenly went missing at the entrance of the theater. Chen, filled with love for his grandson, searched everywhere but could not find him, becoming extremely anxious. Because A'bao was exceptionally lively and the distance to home was not far, he suspected that he might have returned home first. So Chen walked home slowly. Upon reaching the intersection of Jiaxing Road and Auka Road, he saw a crowd of people, blocking traffic. He craned his neck to see what was happening. Who knew that the person lying on the ground was his beloved grandson A'bao! He saw that both his legs were broken and he was unconscious. The accident was caused by a No. 2 public bus, registration number 15-111. A Japanese policeman, number 101, was called to the scene, recorded the car number, and the body was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died within an hour.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Dies</h3>
<p>Autopsy Reveals Death from Heart Disease</p>
<p>At around 6:10 PM last night, at the corner of Tang'en Road, Shenjiaxun, Hongkou, a rickshaw puller, Mr. Jia, about thirty years old, pulling a rickshaw with concession license number 7822, suddenly fell to the ground and died while passing through the area. Street police number 1802 from the Hongkou Police Station arrived and arranged for the body to be sent to Tongren Hospital. After examination by the doctor, it was determined that the deceased died from heart disease. The body was then transferred to the autopsy room for examination.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Teng Ze, Who Privately Housed Weapons</h3>
<p>Detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau reported to the French Police that they recently arrested Dai Bingzhang, who privately housed weapons. Dai confessed that he had jointly purchased a dozen pistols with Teng Ze, who resided under their jurisdiction, for 300 yuan. They requested assistance in arresting Teng Ze for investigation. The police chief approved the request and immediately ordered the detectives to arrest Teng and bring him to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the French Court for questioning. The police chief first reported that the Public Security Bureau detectives had found more than twenty long guns at Dai Bingzhang's house, and Dai confessed that the defendant was an accomplice, requesting an investigation. When questioned, Teng stammered in his confession. The Chinese and Western judges approved the transfer of the defendant to inland officials for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: We recently read a news item in your newspaper's "Local News" column on the 26th regarding the Ministry of Finance's abolishment of the Jiangsu Bureau of Official Property for Land Reclamation, which stated that the case was presented to the provincial government by the people of Changshu and Jiangyin counties, who requested amendments and reforms to the bureau's various tax policies that harmed the country and the people, and that the provincial government approved this and forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for review. The Jiangsu Official Property for Land Reclamation has been in operation for more than ten years and is at the end of its rope. The Ministry of Finance's explicit order to handle the results is purely to reduce the scope and save expenses, initiated by the Ministry itself. The later statements are inconsistent with the facts. We hereby send this letter to request a correction to avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, Jiangsu Bureau of Official Property for Land Reclamation.</p>

<h3>Championship - Sigh</h3>
<p>The clanging bell broke the silence of the entire school. The classroom doors opened, and students poured out like a tide. Some jumped out of the windows to avoid the crowding. Everyone's face showed a look of joy, probably because there was an important championship competition in the school today, and they could enjoy a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>I was arranging books in the dormitory when the door was pushed open with a "ya" sound. The most mischievous Zhen walked in.</p>
<p>"Ah, don't study anymore! There are still two weeks until the exam. Today we have a football match with the sixth grade for the championship. Come and help us cheer!"</p>
<p>I looked at him and couldn't help but laugh. He was wearing a sheepskin robe inside out, a paper hat on his head, and a white cloth flag in his hand with the words "Fifth Grade Cheerleading Squad" written on it.</p>
<p>"Zhen, are you the captain of the cheerleading squad?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, they elected me to do it. Don't waste time. Come with me!"</p>
<p>"You go first. I still have two math problems to solve. I'll come when I'm done."</p>
<p>":::::: Sitting across from me, Qin, was absentmindedly reading a book, seemingly not hearing Zhen's request. "Qin is a hardworking student. He won't join our foolishness. Xin, don't break your promise. Come when you're done with the math problems," Zhen said and turned to leave.</p>
<p>"Such a grown-up person, still so foolish," Qin suddenly looked up and said to me.</p>
<p>"Um:::::" I couldn't think of a suitable answer for a moment and had to respond vaguely.</p>
<p>I originally planned to watch the soccer game after finishing the math problems, but after Qin said that, I felt a little embarrassed. I took a student magazine from the bookshelf and flipped through it casually.</p>
<p>"La la la::::: Fifth grade wins::::: la la la::::: Sixth grade wins:::::"</p>
<p>A loud and noisy sound spread to my eardrums, causing a strong vibration in my heart. I couldn't concentrate on reading anymore.</p>
<p>"I can't restrain myself. Incited by this sound, I also want to join the foolishness," I said to Qin with shame.</p>
<p>"This is everyone's joy. You can't force it," Qin replied kindly.</p>
<p>Walking out of the dormitory, I already saw the surroundings of the playground filled with people. I couldn't see anything inside.</p>
<p>"Xin, why are you coming now? The playground is full of people. Hurry up and come here. You can barely squeeze in one person here. We have already won a goal. Jianmei Bing She.</p>
<p>There is hope for the championship today," Zhen saw me over there, waved to me, and said to me like this.</p>
<p>I squeezed into the crowd. The first thing that caught my eye was the shiny silver championship trophy on the table behind the goal. It was also covered with an exquisite green silk box. Because it was illuminated by the setting sun, it flashed and emitted dazzling light, as if showing off its power. It made so many students abandon their studies to come here to welcome it, support it, and made the players of the two grades sacrifice their energy to be its slaves. Its magic is so great.</p>
<p>"Xin, look how agile Old Wang is. He has already advanced to their territory and is about to score again," Zhen pointed to Old Wang and said to me, interrupting my random thoughts.</p>
<p>"Old Wang's ball skills have improved compared to before."</p>
<p>"Improved a lot."</p>
<p>"Goal!" The surrounding students suddenly shouted like thunder.</p>
<p>"Old Wang is so cute. He scored another one. Let's cheer a few times to boost his morale," Zhen walked up to us and said to a group of people wearing paper hats.</p>
<p>The cheers of the cheerleading squad shifted the attention of the surrounding students. They saw Zhen's inside-out leather robe and the paper hats of the cheerleading squad, and they all opened their mouths and laughed non-stop.</p>
<p>The game started again, and we still had the upper hand. The ball rolled around in their territory. Zhen and the cheerleading squad were shouting and encouraging their courage desperately, shouting until their throats were hoarse, but they still didn't want to stop.</p>
<p>"Shh:::::" Time was up. The referee was blowing his whistle there.</p>
<p>Zhen and the cheerleading squad all ran into the field and picked up Old Wang, sitting him on their shoulders. They were still singing their victory song. Old Wang nodded to his friends with great pride.</p>
<p>The glorious championship trophy had already been taken into the hands of our captain, Xiao Zhuang. In the support and cheers of the students, he walked into the dormitory. The playground, which was once crowded with students, was only left with the lingering sound of shouts and cheers.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Zhonggong Uproar Jian Tang</h3>
<p>The various newspapers at sea have already reported extensively on the Zhonggong incident. However, there are still one or two trivial matters that seem to need to be recorded by this nameless reporter, so I am now taking up my bare pen and scribbling randomly.</p>
<p>Little Kid to Old Man</p>
<p>When Mr. Yu Youren came to the school to announce his intention to maintain order, he gave a sincere exhortation to more than a thousand students in the sports field (because the auditorium was too small). He said, "...You don't study hard, you just mess around. When you grow a beard as long as mine in the future, you will realize how terrible it is. You are just kids, kids," which attracted the attention of many students. Later, a certain gentleman went to Shanghai and saw two or three representatives of the delegation laughing and talking loudly in the train, seemingly forgetting themselves. So, the gentleman listened respectfully and found them saying,</p>
<p>"He knew about the revolution when he was young. We are doing this, which is also a manifestation of revolution."</p>
<p>"He scolded us for being kids, kids. We can also scold him for being an old man, old man, hahaha..."</p>
<p>The gentleman couldn't help but laugh when he heard this. Later, he told the students, who also made a fuss, and some even wanted to write poetry to praise their genius.</p>
<p>Drooling Three Feet</p>
<p>The day before Mr. Yu Youren arrived at the school, the principal's notice board had two pieces of calligraphy written by Mr. Yu himself, one announcing that he would come to the school to maintain order at a certain time in the afternoon the next day, and one addressed to all the students, both written on Xuan paper and stamped. The students gathered to discuss, some saying,</p>
<p>"Ah, what a beautiful piece of calligraphy! It's a pity I can't get it."</p>
<p>Others said, "Oh, look, it's written on Xuan paper and stamped. This is obviously his way of letting us take it to frame it. However, I don't know if I have the blessing to get it..."</p>
<p>"Yes, do you have that blessing?"</p>
<p>"....Which of us has that kind of blessing?"</p>
<p>"........"</p>
<p>"........"</p>
<p>After such a commotion, the great curtain of night gradually unfolded, and the busy people slowly entered the depths of sleep. At this time, a majestic disciplinary squad, holding a huge wooden stick, ran to the principal's notice board as fast as lightning, hoping to get that precious piece of calligraphy. However, the calligraphy had already "disappeared without a trace." The next morning, many young men and women continued to come to the green glass mirror frame, showing a look of surprise, lingering and reluctant to leave.</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>
<p>The Huili Company at No. 12 Niuzhuang Road declared that its oil business department has recently invented various kinds of raw materials for daily use, such as raw oil and soybean oil, which are inexpensive and of good quality, and the oil color is smooth and bright. The price ranges from one corner and seven points to seven yuan. Those who try it all praise it and welcome it very much.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Gramophone Company at No. 15 Zhifu Road declared that it specializes in wholesale distribution of major domestic and foreign brands, with very prosperous sales and a long-standing reputation. It manufactures various artistic gramophones and manages records of famous singers from various companies. New-style clocks and watches have been shipped from Europe and the United States, and the inventory is piled up like a mountain. Every year-end, to reward retail customers, all goods are sold at a loss. A special discount department is set up, with each gramophone sold for only eleven yuan. The repair department charges low fees and guarantees accuracy. Therefore, the door is crowded with customers every day, and the staff is overwhelmed. All circles who want to buy, please don't miss this opportunity.</p>
<p>The Yuanyuan Hat Shop declared that its Yuanyuan hat made of sea tiger velvet was invented in the 12th year of the Republic of China. The style and manufacturing method have been modified several times before reaching perfection, resulting in considerable losses. It was initially popular among opera fans, and then promoted to literary and art circles. It has been sold in Taicang, Sichuan, Hubei and other places for a long time. Last year, political and business circles in this city also liked to buy and wear it, and business progressed rapidly, with supply falling short of demand, causing many latecomers to regret it. I am sincerely sorry. Now, more products have been added to meet the demand. However, there are shameless people who specialize in imitating and selling goods with imperfect styles and manufacturing methods, filling the market. There have even been cases of counterfeit brands in other cities. Buyers who are unaware are easily deceived. Therefore, we solemnly declare that the Yuanyuan hat has a silk woven yellow background and black letter brand inside. The style is a long cone shape. Those without a brand and with a round surface are counterfeit goods. Please be aware.</p>

<h3>The Last Night · Question · Cuckoo</h3>
<p>From six to nine in the afternoon is the golden age of our dormitory. Seven or eight classmates surround the stove, reading books or knitting things with yarn. If there were also a pile of peanuts and a few oranges, that would be like possessing the whole world.</p>
<p>Their hands move up and down, with red, green, and various other colors of yarn appearing particularly beautiful under the electric light. The sound of their conversations is as endless as the yarn in their hands. The rest of the people also bury themselves in their books, seemingly oblivious to everything around them. They tilt their heads, appearing very interested, or occasionally jot something down in their notebooks. As for glancing at others, that's just a fleeting moment.</p>
<p>Only S sits quietly in a corner, her face turning red and then white, or suddenly biting her lip and smiling slightly. The meaning expressed by her psychological state is completely unrelated to the environment before her eyes, which is very obvious.</p>
<p>Qian, who sits closest to S, was originally copying something, but often puts down her pen because of her neighbor. She also has a worried look on her face. If the light were not blocked by her book, one could see that her eyes were full of tears.</p>
<p>Hui, who loves to talk the most and is nicknamed "Chatterbox Girl," starts singing:</p>
<p>"Sad is parting, joyful is a new marriage. Silk sister, you are leaving your old friends to establish a new family. Don't you think about how lonely and desolate your Qian will be?"</p>
<p>As her singing stops, the expressions of everyone in the room change. Some stop knitting and say nothing, or gaze at Silk, who is trimming her nails, with a look of affection. Those reading books also put them down, their minds leaving the paradise in the books and returning to the realm of reality.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the room suddenly becomes tense. Everyone seems to have something to say, but no one can utter a word.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with you all?" Silk asks shyly, her voice as low as a mosquito's hum.</p>
<p>"This is the only night we have to sit together with you. After three years of being classmates, once we separate, not to mention Qian, even we feel very sad." Hen, who is easily moved, suddenly uses her handkerchief to wipe her eyes as she speaks.</p>
<p>"I will come back," Silk says softly. "Yes, studies are important," Hen interjects. Qian buries her head in her book, only her shoulders can be seen shaking slightly.</p>
<p>"Why do people like to get married in winter? Can't they get married at other times?" Chatterbox Girl starts another discussion.</p>
<p>"I don't believe Silk's future 'stool' will also be a person who superstitiously follows old customs. I'm afraid that because he's going to work in the three northeastern provinces, he wants to bring his new wife along to show off even more," this voice comes from behind the stove, it's Huai, the optimist.</p>
<p>"What's so good about it? That fat-headed, big-faced fellow. I get angry when I see him sticking to Silk like a fly to honey. If they don't ask me to see her off next week, fine, but if they ask me to see her off, I'll beat him up to vent my anger," Chatterbox Girl says, actually clenching her fist.</p>
<p>Silk's face turns from white to red, and the scissors in her hand fall, but she doesn't even notice.</p>
<p>"Is she worried or happy? 'A woman's marriage is like being born again.' This is just a proverb, but how can women who don't eat human food and don't know the taste of smoke be an exception? As soon as a woman gets married, her entire life changes. Her behavior and demeanor change, her temperament changes, she simply becomes a different person. Needless to say about old-fashioned marriages, even modern love marriages are no exception. Although I am not a man, let alone a Jia Baoyu-like man, every time I encounter the marriage of my classmates, I always feel extremely heartbroken, and I often sigh secretly, 'Alas, we have lost one more of our kind.' The most precious pink journey of a young girl has come to an end, and even the poetic realm of love will probably disappear from now on. Trivial household chores and the burden of children are all sharp weapons that wear down the flowery youth of women. Not only are they prone to premature aging physically, but even their former bright and vigorous minds will probably be covered with a layer of smoke. Although there are many happy marriages in the world, my prejudice just can't see the joy in them. I always think this is a decaying corpse covered with a brocade canopy: : : :" I was silently thinking about this when something was thrown at my face. Ouch, it's hot, I shouted. I looked and saw that it was a baked sweet potato, so I asked,</p>
<p>"Are there still baked sweet potatoes for sale at this time? It's almost nine o'clock."</p>
<p>"Haha, there are more here. Do you want to buy some?" Huai smiled. It turned out that she had taken some raw sweet potatoes from somewhere and was quietly baking them behind the stove.</p>
<p>"Well-baked, but a bit raw," Chatterbox said.</p>
<p>"You should be happy you even got one to eat," Huai replied.</p>
<p>The depressing atmosphere just now was suddenly broken by the baked sweet potatoes for a while, but it soon returned to its original state. Hen moved her chair closer to Silk, and the two chattered endlessly. Qian's eyes never dried.</p>
<p>The dormitory bell rang, but no one paid attention to it. This is our world. Even if the instructor comes, she can't do anything to us. Anyway, we are not making noise, what are we afraid of her? This shared mentality dominates everyone's actions, so everyone holds on and refuses to say the word "sleep." Usually, by half-past nine, everyone is ostensibly asleep. Tonight, because of the farewell to Silk, everyone feels that the time is too short and wishes they didn't have to sleep. Also, who is willing to be the first to leave this place?</p>
<p>"Tomorrow is Saturday, the workload is light, who cares? Let's sit for a while longer," Huai said, she had finished her task of baking sweet potatoes.</p>
<p>"I won't go to the three northeastern provinces, I will definitely come back before the winter vacation," Silk and Hen's conversation ended with this sentence.</p>
<p>"Hmph, we'll see about that. We don't hope you'll come again, we only ask that when you have new knowledge, you don't forget your old friends altogether, and we'll be grateful for your affection," Hen's voice rose, and her eyes also turned red.</p>
<p>"I'm keeping your bed for you, and I'm preserving the many impressions you gave us. But every time I look at your empty space, how can I not shed tears? You are the sun in our class. After you leave, I feel that the whole world has become dark," the optimistic Huai also complained.</p>
<p>A thin layer of melancholy also covered Silk's joyous face. Her expression seemed like she wanted to cry and also wanted to laugh. In the end, the crying emotion prevailed, and her tears dripped one by one from those beautiful eyes onto her clothes.</p>
<p>The room was quiet, only the cracking sound of the charcoal in the stove broke the silence.</p>
<p>"I'll go tell that stool tomorrow and tell him to roll away himself. Wouldn't it be over if our Silk doesn't get married? You people are all useless, you can't think of a solution," Chatterbox's words made everyone laugh.</p>
<p>Qian and Hen·Silk's tears hung in their eyes, and they also laughed so hard that they leaned back and forth.</p>
<p>"Dang lang, dang lang," the bell outside rang again.</p>
<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Probably because we're not sleeping," Qian finally spoke for the first time this evening, and she was obviously very tired and just wanted to fall on the bed and cry loudly.</p>
<p>Silk stood up as if she had found a savior, picked up the scissors on the ground, and took Qian's arm, preparing to leave first.</p>
<p>"Slow down, this is the last night. Don't be so heartless. Can you just leave without saying goodbye to your many old friends? Hmph, the auspicious day is still early," Chatterbox said indignantly.</p>
<p>"Don't be impatient, the earth will always turn slowly," Huai echoed.</p>
<p>"As long as you say one sentence, I'll let you go. Speak from your heart, is the love of your classmates deeper, or the love of a stool deeper?" Chatterbox said, blocking the door.</p>
<p>"Cla｜｜Classmates' love is deeper," Silk said helplessly in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Haha, let her go," everyone laughed.</p>
<p>Ten o'clock struck, and Silk next door was already asleep. I don't know what she dreamed of, perhaps future happiness.</p>
