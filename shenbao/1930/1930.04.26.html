<p>時評</p>
<h3>英埃談判停頓訊</h3>
<p>埃及獨立後英埃間所留遺之懸案。經迭次屢瀕於危之會議而未解决者。今則兩方皆抱有速决之願望。故於此次埃代表赴英時。埃人民竭誠歡送。而英人民亦竭誠歡迎。乃不意談判之結果。仍以蘇丹問題爲最大之阻力。今日外電謂埃内閣澈夜會議後。發表宣言。政府决不變更管理蘇丹之要求。而英方亦絕無可以讓步之表示。則此次之英埃談判。恐又將無望矣。</p>
<p>夫蘇丹之所以成爲無法解决之問題者。以英埃兩方皆有切身之關係故。蘇丹在埃及之南。地極富饒。早即爲埃及所統治。自一八八二年蘇丹發生變亂。埃及藉英助力以敉平之。遂有英埃共管之情勢。糾紛亦即由斯而起。惟在埃及方面。則以爲就歷史論。旣與埃及有關係。而就地理論。蘇丹在尼羅河上游。當然屬埃。且爲埃及水源所在。埃人當言。埃及對於尼羅河水之供给。不是便利問題而爲生命問題蘇。丹統治權。若握於他人。則隨時有感受壓迫之虞。故埃及始終不肯稍示放棄。而在英方。則以爲英人投資於蘇丹旣鉅。且於佔領後力謀蘇丹產業發展。修水堤。開運河。並　築鐵道。苦心經營。意蓋以爲保有蘇丹。旣可控制紅海至印度之航權。又可控制好望角至開羅之路線。大與英國國本有益。故亦不肯放手而不爭。蘇丹問題關於英埃兩方切身之利害旣如此。故自埃及獨立以至最近商訂條約。雖經談判多次。兩方從未稍有遷就之表示。且皆視爲合法之爭其間縱多調停之主張。有謂宜將此問題交國際聯盟解决者又有謂宜將蘇丹劃分爲二。以分隸於英埃者。然皆爲英埃所拒。非各貫澈其主張不可。故就情勢論。此問題實無解决之善法。然而長此相持。愈增惡感。且蘇丹内部。亦頗不靜。反英運動。難保不再發現。糾紛愈多。解决愈難。邦交不更可慮耶。</p>

<h3>歐洲經濟危機</h3>
<p>與英德政局</p>
<p>（特約通信化魯）</p>
<p>生產膨脹與失業增加</p>
<p>經濟危機影響於政局</p>
<p>德國右傾内閣之登台</p>
<p>英國工黨内閣之現狀</p>
<p>歐洲之產業界、因大戰而造成之變態現象、幾已完全消失、各國工商金融、皆已回復戰前之常軌、而同時劇烈之產業競爭、亦繼之而起、且較戰前尤過之、由此產業競爭、產出兩種不能避免之惡果、即工業生產之過度膨脹、與工人失業之繼續增加、此二者爲歐洲目前最迫切之問題、一切政局之變化、社會之騷動、皆與此二問題有密切之關係、</p>
<p>現在歐洲各大工業國之工業生產、均遠較大戰前爲增加、雖各國國内人民之購買力、亦同時增加、但决不足以消納此過度之生產、工業品之大部分、則全賴世界市塲、以供其排洩、但大戰以後、美國工商業勃興、佔世界市場之重要部分、日本工商發展、又佔有遠東市塲之大部分、同時俄國及東歐、戰後購買力大爲减退、因此歐洲各大工業國之生產品、無不呈供過於求之勢、各國爲保護其工商業起見、則繼續增加輸入關稅率、以抵制外貨、但關稅增高、雖可保護其國内市塲、而他國爲報復起見、亦不免高築稅壁、以相抵制、例如近年美國繼續增高關稅以排斥歐貨、而歐洲各國、亦以其人之道、還治其人之身、各自增加稅率、以免美貨之侵襲、同時歐洲各國相互間、亦有同樣之關稅戰爭、此種關稅戰爭之結果、使工業品之銷路、愈見窒塞、上月國際聯盟召集歐洲各國關稅會議、締結歐洲各國間之短期的關稅休戰、但因各國利害衝突、所得結果、殊無關出入、即使各國均放棄保護政策、在自由競爭之局面下、日前世界銷費市塲、仍無法容納此日進月增之大規模的工業生產、因此目前歐戰各大工業國、不免呈現經濟之危機、許多工業因缺乏銷路、不能支持、同時因厲行合理化之結果、工業組織之較幼稚落後者、更難立足、結果所至、則失業工人、日益增加、經濟之危機、遂促成社會之危機、</p>
<p>目前各大工業國、能免於失業恐慌者、惟法國而已、蓋法國人口增加較緩、農業尚未崩潰、而戰後工業發展甚速、故暫時無失業問題、此外各國、則無不感失業之困難、美國戰後繁榮、甲於天下、而今年失業工人增至五百萬、歐洲各國則尤甚、此種飢寒之失業羣衆、不但成爲最迫切之社會危機、且影響於各國政局、各國政治之阢隍不安、内閣之席不暇暖、大多由於此經濟的社會的危機所促成、最近英德兩國之内政變化、實其最顯著之例也、德國慕婁之混合内閣、於最近顚覆、由天主敎黨之卜魯寗改組右側之混合内閣、慕婁内閣係由社會黨民主黨·天主敎黨·人民黨·聯合而成、其色彩多少爲左傾的、對外主和平、對内主勞資妥協、然因閣員意見之紛歧、久有解體之勢、反對派之國民黨在國會及輿論機關、攻擊政府、尤不遺餘力、但揚格計畫與德波商約、卒在國會通過、此次閣潮、則完全因財政問題而起、蓋一九三零年度德國預算、收入不敷支出達四五萬萬馬克、内閣中代表大工商業主之人民黨閣員、主張削减失業勞動者之補助金、增加消費物品之稅率以謀預算之平衡、社會黨加以反對、兩方意見、不能融洽、於是内閣遂提出辭職、興登堡總統、乃命天主敎黨首領卜魯寗組閣、卜魯寗内閣於三月終告成、其阁員乃就前内閣之民主黨·人民黨·天主敎黨閣員、再加國會中之中右側各黨聯合而成、蓋純粹右側之内閣也、卜魯寗内閣成立後、極端右傾之德意志國民黨、守善意之中立態度、惟社會黨及共產黨、處於反對態度、新閣以著名之史昔爾爲糧食總長、謀得農民之擁護、同時準備提出財政案、减少直接稅、增加間接稅、總之新内閣爲傾向資產階級之内閣、於企業家之利益、將力加保護、就目前德國之工業情形、失業工人、總數達三百餘萬、社會黨雖失去政權、必竭力與政府爭圖、新内閣則主張於必要時解散國會重行選舉、可見德國之政潮、方興未艾、而經濟的社會的危機、實爲促成德國内政糾紛之主因也</p>
<p>英國亦有與德國相同之情形、英工黨雖較德國社會黨更强有力、但在國會中、則全賴自由黨之妥協合作、方能維持其工黨政府之生命、麥唐納内閣執政以來、將及十月、在外交方面、如英美妥協、對俄復交等、雖獲得相當之成功、然於内政方面、則爲經濟難局所阨、尚未尋得出路、失業問題、本爲工黨政府最關切之點、工黨於去年選舉中能獲得勝利、亦以大多數選民盼望減少失業人數之故、但自工黨上臺以後、一切救濟方法、均無效果、失業工人、反日見增加、至今年三月、英國失業人數達一百六十餘萬、爲八年以來所未有、蓋工黨在國會中、未能佔有過半席次、不能提出比較急進之社會主義政策、徒從事於枝枝節節之解决、故不免勞而無功、其對内政策之困難、固無可諱言、其賴以維持生存者、蓋唯外交政策、然麥唐納史汀生所倡導之倫敦海軍會議、開會三月、聚訟紛紜、結果甚鮮、就目前形勢、法意兩國無妥協餘地、海軍會議、縱免破裂、至多亦不過成就英美日三國之短期的協定而已、近來工黨政府、在國會提案、屢遭多數否决、幸賴自由黨之妥協、得以維持、而經濟危機之解决方策、實爲决定此後英國政局方向最重要之一點、因當前之產業危機、使社會鬭爭、日益劇烈、又因此社會鬭爭而影響於政治、致使政局日陷於阢隍不安、此則英德兩國所共有之現象也、（四月五日寄自巴黎）</p>

<h3>租界特别戒備</h3>
<p>公共租界總巡捕房、以日來租界區域、時有重大案件發生、捕房方面、爲維持地面安全計、除隨時督飭中西探捕、沿途暗察外、於今晨五時起、宣佈特别戒備、并簽發正式命令、通知全租界十二捕房、對於落差華捕、一律留駐捕房、聽候隨時調遣、以便必要時、動員出發云、</p>
<h3>公共租界　電車昨日罷工</h3>
<p>電車工人提出要求九項</p>
<p>自公共租界公共汽車罷工笔後、未及一星期、英美電車公司司機賣票等工人、亦於昨午全體罷工、致行駛各馬路之有軌無軌電車完全停頓、據公司方面宣稱當罷工之前、並未接有工人何項警告云云、但據工人方面消息、要求條件、已於兩日前向公司提出、但無答復、故於昨日實行罷工云云、聞此次罷工原因、係電車於上星期日起加價後、每日收入較前劇增、至一千四百元之鉅電車工人、以現在米珠薪桂、即起而爲增資運動、另一原因、聞爲公共汽車公司工人罷工後、該公司對工人要求、未能容納、且另僱俄人、充開車賣票之役、電車工人以同一公用事業、遂以罷工援助、是亦一部分原因、茲將昨聞種種、彙誌如次、</p>
<p>罷工經過電車工人罷工徵象、前日已略見端倪、該日電車工人、向公司方面曾有增加每日米貼七分之要求、該公司當時聞即答允、因是該日遂平安過去、不謂昨晨六時、電車開始行駛時間已到、該公司提籃橋老廠開車賣票工人、約七百人、仍不見報到、始知一部分電車工人、已開始罷工、因是東區電車、如六路七路八路九路有軌電車、十七路十八路無軌電車、遂即於昨日侵晨起、首告停頓、延至昨午、罷工風潮、擴展至西區赫德路新廠、一二等路電車工人、遂開車回廠、繼起罷工、昨日下午二時起、公共租界全部電事、遂告陷於完全停頓狀態、</p>
<p>罷工範圍　法租界電車及公共汽車、除行駛公共租界路綫者、稍受影響外、餘仍照常行駛、法商五路電車、其路線爲往來北火車站與西門一帶、十八·十七兩路無軌電車、因須經過公共租界、故自英美電車實現罷工後、該路電車、遂縮短路綫、僅往來於英法租界交界處爲止、而不駛入公共租界範圍矣、至南市電車、公共汽車、及閘北公共汽車則亦行駛如常、</p>
<p>罷工條件　電車工人提出罷工要求九項如下、（一）每人每月一律增加工資八元、（二）每人每月一律給米貼三元、（三）承認俱樂部有代表全體工人之權、每月由資方津貼辦公費用三百元、（四）星期節假休息、工資照給、工作者雙倍、（五）因病請假、工資照給、（六）罷工期内工資照給（七）不得開除工人、反對雇用白俄、（八）釋放被捕工人、以後不得逮捕工人（九）各處計時亭、設立茶缸、</p>
<p>罷工紀律　（一）絕對服從罷工委員會命令、（二）積極參加罷工工作、（三）凡有下列各種破壞罷工行爲者、即是工賊走狗、嚴厲對付、一未接到罷工委員會復工命令、私自上工者、二、作種種破壞罷工的宣傳者、三·勾結資本家及壓迫工人的走狗機關、向敵人告密者、上海英界電車公司罷工委員會佈、四月廿五日、</p>
<p>公司態度　大晚報云、電車罷工後、記者往見該公司總經理鮑奇斯、鮑稱、此次突然罷工、即在渠亦出意外、當晨間悉提籃橋一帶電車停駛後、公司中人莫不甚爲驚異、現雖有種種表示、似可作爲罷工之理由、但究竟如何、工方迄無表示、廠中未接加薪之正式要求、渠料此事亦非爲加薪而起、現鮑氏方靜待工方正式通知其罷工之動機云、</p>
<h3>納稅會駁辯</h3>
<p>麥克唐納謬論</p>
<p>華人向麥氏掛號甚多造成其地位</p>
<p>麥氏演說思想陳腐破壞中外合作</p>
<p>違英政府對華外交政策</p>
<p>使英政府宣言等於廢紙</p>
<p>上海租界納稅華人會、對於本月十六日、麥克唐納在納稅西人會席上之演說、昨特發表中英兩文之駁斥書、茲錄其中文者如下、</p>
<p>上海公共租界工部局對於本年增加華董兩席之議案、於本年四月十六日在納稅外人會討論、經納稅外人麥克唐納氏（係葛福萊律師公館之律師）作長時間之演說、在塲納稅外人、被其狂言鼓動、盲從否决、中外人士、同深惋惜、均認歷年中外合作精神、爲之破壞、麥克唐納氏固應負其責任、而在塲少數納稅外人、不加深察、遽予通過、亦爲其一大原因、</p>
<p>本會對於麥克唐納之演說、以其組織混亂、思想陳腐、架造事實、缺乏根據、毫無價值、且即因此演說而促成之結果、於法當然無效、本無駁辯之必要、惟愛護歷年中外合作之精神、不忍一旦爲之破壞、或致發生不幸之事、實不得不有一言、以爲中外市民告、惟本會於駁辯麥克唐納氏演說之前、應將本會之宣言抄錄如下、以明本會之立塲、（本會確認上海公共租界納稅外人無權討論或决定關於公共租界納稅華人應有之市民權利、根據此項原則、對於本年四月十六日納稅外人會否决增加工部局華董兩席一案、當然無效特此鄭重宣言、）</p>
<p>查麥克唐納氏之演說、其性質爲情感者、而非理智者、其作用爲破壞者、而非建設者、其結果爲使外人困難而招華人反感者、至其思想則陳腐不堪、更屬違反時代精神、麥克唐納氏更自忘其爲英人、因而破壞英政府近來對華之外交政策於不顧、該項演說、如在長時間會議中、除認爲無採納之價值、不能成立外、本難發生任何之効力、無如公共租界之納稅外人會、其性質類乎一時集合之市民大會、且在塲納稅外人、對於該案可稱極大多數無深切之研究、經其一番夜郎自大·自無中國主權·目無中華民族·之演說、幾皆忘其身處中國領土上之議事廳内、會外有絕對大多數之中國市民、遂如羣兒之被催眠、發生羣衆心理上必不易免之盲從行爲、此實會議制度之不善、否則何以外人輿論、對於該案之結果、均加以嚴重之批評而主張補救者也、</p>
<p>本會以爲麥克唐納所促成之舉動、不但使公共租界全體市民、判爲中外兩撅、且使英政府近來恢復華人好感之意旨、受一打擊、誠爲界内外人之不幸、亦爲英政府之不幸也、</p>
<p>麥克唐納之演說、其攻訐工部局董事之處、與謂提案之由壓迫而來、及其理由之不充分、本會無置辯之責任、至謂華董之謀華人利益、是否贊助上海各路商界聯合會之宣言等等、則本會以爲各路商界聯合會之宣言、如係公道之主張、則任何華人、靡不贊助、否則雖欲贊助而爲正義所不許、五卅慘案、係由當日工部局主持人濫用職權所致、華董爲求合作精神之貫澈、從中斡旋、解决卹金一部份、屬爲英人解圍、五卅烈士公墓五卅烈士家屬、自願捐撥卹金二萬元、其餘建築費用、由華人捐助而來、此係紀念當日烈士、爲正義人道而犧牲、於情於理、皆自有故、五卅烈士公墓之建設、華人尚嫌規模太小、而賠償問題、今尚懸而未决、不無遺憾、再排外運動之有無、全視外人是否有非理壓迫華人之處、然華人爲有理智之民族、觀華人經麥克唐納氏侮辱演說之結果、而仍和平鎭靜忍辱負重、以俟公道正義之判斷、足證排外運動之說、全係麥克唐納氏之讕言、且工部局之華董、自係謀華人利益、正如外董之謀外人利益、否則工部局之董事、即應由全體市民、不分國籍混合選舉、不必事實上規定中國幾席、英幾席、美幾席、日本幾席、然華重是否專利華人利益、外人是否不專謀外人利益、請一觀工部局之預算、用於外人所享者多乎、用於華人所享者多乎、例如敎育經費、外人佔多乎、華人佔多乎、電氣處之出售、華人均反對、華董爲華人所推舉、自亦以華人之意旨爲意旨、就本會所知、麥克唐納氏爲英人葛福萊律師公館之律師、該律師公館華人向之掛號者甚多、恐其得有出席納稅外人會之資格、或由華人所造成、今彼得華人之惠而反噬華人、對於華人之利益、恣情破壞、實出於情理之外、本會所深爲慨嘆者也、</p>
<p>麥克唐納氏之演說中、謂華董是否能代表華人、其選舉方法如何、其政見如何、立塲如何、納稅華人、其數若干、均未知悉云云、以此數語觀之、本會殊爲麥克唐納氏可憐萬分、蓋本會之選舉方法及納稅人數目與選舉情形、均披露於報紙、凡識中國字者、靡不知之、麥克唐納氏或以入其國而不知其文字、以致有此言論、夫批評一社會事、須自行留意日常之事實、今麥克唐納氏對於報紙上本會之消息、一槪不知、其言論自多成爲造架事實、雖居中國八九十年、亦屬毫無認識、遑論八九年哉、</p>
<p>麥克唐納氏又於其演說中、侈陳政府在印度殖民政策之歷史、以鼓動在場納稅外人自大之心理、益證其頭腦之陳腐、將英政府近來之外交政策、置之度外、且慫恿納稅英人背叛英政府、本會殊爲英政府及其旅滬人民危、蓋麥克唐納氏之言、足使其專謀職業絕無侵略野心之英政府宣言、等於廢紙、同時在國外專謀職業、絕無侵略野心之英國人民、其職業地位、有發生動搖基礎之虞、本會殊覺代爲寒心也、</p>
<p>麥克唐納氏引一七九三年亡清乾隆帝致英皇之國書、於其演說中、更顯露其排華之思想、並欲籍以運動在塲納稅外人一致爲排華之運動、凡具有侵略野心之外人、每遇華人爲華人求公道正義之主張、抵抗此種外人之壓迫時、報誣爲排外運動、外人如此、排華運動與排外運動、均爲與正義公道所不許者、應有以糾正麥克唐納氏之謬妄、抑尤有進者、乾隆時代爲閉關時代、其思想且爲封建時代之專制思想不足以代表現在之華人、且此僅爲一種言論、較以近五年五卅·萬縣·沙基·三大慘案實施者之殘暴行爲、恐猶是以小巫見大巫也、本會不念舊惡者、實欲據此慘案以促如麥克唐納氏之外人自行反省耳、（未完）</p>
<h3>日人</h3>
<p>積極援助增加華董案</p>
<p>起草援助具體辦法</p>
<p>定下星期三日開會</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>旅滬日僑、前日下午、召集納稅日人討論特别納稅人會、全體出席、一致贊成增加華董人數案、後因是日所到納稅日人、僅有三十餘人、福島·齋藤·兩董事恐邀集未能普及、意見難期一致、故散會後、曾與日僑聯合會會長林雄吉商定積極援助辦法、當由福島·齋藤·兩人担任起草積極援助之具體方法草案、分發各納稅日人鄭重研究、定下星期三再召集會議一次、最後决定辦法、預定五月二日特别納稅人會全體納稅日人一致出席、全體投票贊成華董增加二人、據福島君語人云、董事由三人增加至五人、與將來租界行政發展、有重大關係、就界内華市民人數而論、亦有多寡不均之感、此種現象、實於租界行政不利、是以本人絕對主張日本市民應積極援助、使增加華董人數案、能早日通過成立云、</p>

<h3>浙移民今日出關</h3>
<p>第一批祇四百餘人</p>
<p>浙江移民赴遼、開墾荒地、由上海取齊出發、已屢誌本報、茲因温屬災民、昨晚可到上海、今日准可由華陽輪載送出發、記者昨遇運送委何正榮君、承告此次運民出關、及墾荒等情、亟爲分誌如下、</p>
<p>災民昨夜到齊　今回出關之移民、初定一千四百名、繼改八百人、其中以温州之樂清·平陽兩處、因去年被災最重、故所定名額亦最多、其餘如台州·諸曁·瑞昌·等處、各僅三十餘名、第一次從滬杭車送來上海者、三百餘人、昨日已一律上華陽輪、其餘温台兩屬、本定五百人、乘招商局之海晏輪來滬者、昨據領導委員高姚二人電告、言該處移民、因家鄉觀念太深、不能如額招集、現據報到出發者、祇七十名左右、已乘海晏輪、准定二十五日夜中八時可抵滬、即晚在金利源碼頭上華陽輪、故第一批、祗有四百餘名送去也、各災民昨晚登輪者、由各委員支配艙位、分集管理之、</p>
<p>今晨離滬出關　浙江省政府特派運送主鄭喻、委員何正榮、胡儒引等、沿途押送、隨輪同往、准定今日上午九時離滬赴營口、在東北方面、已先派海鹽縣長李光宇駐遼、任移民到瀋後之食宿照料、及與遼民廳接洽、分送墾區諸事、昨日已發電通知矣、今次移民之經費、自杭州方面送出者、歸省府担任、由温台各屬送出者歸縣署担負、</p>
<p>出關墾荒計劃　據何正榮委員言、浙江每一平方英里内現在人口、平均約有七十餘名、幾等於日本、而東省地多人少、每一平方里中、僅有十二三人、此次浙省移民出關、的確爲貧民謀出路之最好辦法、不特有益民生、有裨國計、而近年日本人、高麗人之在東北墾植者、日見增加、大好利源、爲外人侵占、抑且與我國之邊防關係、尤爲重大也、今回浙災民到遼以後、擬分兩種辦法、其無資之貧戸、先充該地之之雇工、而有資者、則領田自墾、而將來之發展更大、</p>
<p>東北創墾水田　浙省調查委員、上次到遼、與東北當局、曾磋商多次、以該處現時墾種之田、多數爲高梁荳粟、擬乘此浙江移民前往、開墾水田、使可植禾產米、且東北地土、有四尺深可資種植、較江浙土質尤肥、引開水田後、可以兩年免下肥料、收豐而本輕、農戸之富、較東南更快、何君又言、本人今回到遼實地視察後、决計親赴浙省各縣鄉、極力宣傳、勸農民勿囿于鄉土觀念、速赴東北去開寳藏、</p>
<p>送回病人八名　先來上海之移民三百餘人中、忽有八人患病、勢不能再往遼寗、乃由委員主任鄭喻等議决、將此八人停止移送、昨日已經先行遣送回本鄉矣、</p>

<p>主與僕同遭屠殺　六歳孩命該不絕</p>
<h3>事主郭椿森臥病醫院幸免於難</h3>
<p>兇器一斧一刀····逃逸一僕一婢</p>
<p>鮮血凝結錦衾····滿室屍横枕籍</p>
<p>兄妹學校趕回····觸景呼天搶地</p>
<p>四鄰恐怖萬狀····捕房嚴重注意</p>
<p>昨晨二時許、滬西愛文義路至德里一一六九號居戸郭椿森家、突然發生兇殺全家七口巨案、除郭本人因病　居寶隆醫院、其子女兩人在復旦大學住讀及六歲長孫外、全家男女僕役七口、無一倖免、兇手遺下兇器利斧及廚刀各一柄、逃逸無蹤、至晨間七時、始經鄰人發覺、誠爲滬上空前未有之慘劇、爰就本報記者調查所得、分述於下</p>
<p>曾充任和議代表　郭椿森、現年五十歲、號松年、廣西桂林人、曾充第一届參議院議員、民國七年、南北政府分立、北政府派王揖唐爲南北議和代表、南政府係軍政府七總裁制、岑春暄爲主席、郭及曾彥、均被派爲議和代表、其後莫榮新任廣東督軍時、郭充督署參謀長、民九莫去職後、郭即離粤來滬、優游海上、寓居公共租界愛文義路至德里一弄末家一一六九號、</p>
<p>家庭狀况之一斑郭之長子伯起、年廿三歲、與其未出閣之胞妹偕讀於復旦大學爲住讀生、伯起於十七歲時、娶厦門輪船巨商劉某之女雁秋爲室、翌年即舉一雄、取名蘇生現年六歲、數年中復生二子、一名達生、年四歲、一名梅生、年三歲、此外尚有男僕一名、廚子一名、婢女三名、及郭妻黎氏、現年四十四歲、全家共十二人、除長子伯起及其胞妹在校住讀外、住家中者共十人、</p>
<p>郭椿森養疴醫院　郭椿森早年服務政界、近因年力就衰、身體虚弱、時患疾病、二月前患横痃、醫治罔效、後投寳隆醫院診治、未年半月即痊可出院、然至本月十四日後、因左腿患有熱瘡、重投寳隆醫院施診、住一○七號房間、每日所費、約在五元之譜、平日探望之人、除一僕役外、别無他人</p>
<p>深夜中慘痛呼聲愛文義路至德里一帶地方、處公共租界西區、入晚即少行人、昨晨二時許、至德里居戸均在黑甜鄉中、然郭椿森家中此時正大演慘劇、貼隣某姓家、在此萬籟俱寂之時、突聞郭家啊唷之慘痛呼聲連作、聲浪雖其明晰、但以他家之事、與己無關、况海上陋規、各人不肯預聞外事、且弄中比隣、均皆不知姓名、斯時郭家啊唷之聲、或爲主人訓斥奴婢、遂亦處之泰然、實不知郭家正演空前未有之大變也、</p>
<p>小孩大哭告慘刧　郭之長孫蘇生、年方六歲、至昨日清早七時許、由後門出外、隣人一見、知爲郭家小主、何以清早獨身出外、遂即阻其去路、不意蘇生立時大哭、謂我家之人都死、隣右聞而色變、人則愈聚愈衆、斯時適對隣至德里房東何宅保鑣一聞郭孫之言、立偕隣右數人同往、被則首先領導、振衣入室、</p>
<p>後天井血流成渠　當隣人至郭家時、見後天井中血流成渠、腥臭不堪、其下面後廂房中、本爲男僕郭崧安、廚子郭朝龍同臥、此時見郭朝龍頭部已被砍腐、頭頸只有薄皮相連、鮮血淋漓、異常悽慘、帳被衣服、皆染赤色、地上遺有劈柴刀一把、而男僕郭崧安、不見隻影、隣人頓民起疑竇、一方使人投報捕房餘人復往樓上視察、見此慘况、恐怖萬狀、</p>
<p>一家人同遭吹斃　該管靜安寺路捕房得訊後、立飭中西探員前往查勘、至時見郭媳劉雁秋女士臥室在客堂樓上、頭頸亦被砍斷、現年二十三歲、三子梅生、年方三歲、尚與其母劉氏同床、亦被吹殺、亭子間中本爲使女從貴·春蓮·及長子蘇生·次子達生·所住、除從貴在逃外、餘均頭頸砍斷、而樓上西廂房爲郭妻黎氏之臥室、年已四十有四、與幼婢秋蓮同居、兩人頸部、亦被砍斷、床畔遺有切菜刀一柄、血跡殷然、</p>
<p>遭大故扶病回家　捕房中西探員以此案情節重大、立禀捕頭、親往踏勘捕房爲將來偵查計、用電光照攝取眞相、一面知照住居寳隆醫院之郭椿森、郭聞訊之下、以家遭大故、不得不扶病返家、一見慘狀、痛不欲生、繼又召其子女回來、只言其母患病而亡、長子伯起與女正在復旦大學上課、聞此警耗、遂亦僱車疾馳而來、其侄郭蒼、在曁南大學讀書、亦得郭家電召同歸、</p>
<p>兩兄妹搶地呼天　郭伯起兄妹兩人、旣抵家中、見慈母嬌妻愛子、均遭慘殺、呼天搶地、痛不欲生、繼而檢點首飾衣服與值錢之物、早已不翼而飛、約計損失、亦在數千元之上、至男僕郭崧安·使婢從貴、携取貴重物品捲逃、至此已無容疑義、對此一家七口慘死、當蒙重大嫌疑、據其家人述、此次慘殺、實出意外、因男僕郭崧安現年念三、平日爲人、亦頗誠篤、不過二月之前、郭與婢從貴、常有曖昩行爲、主婦黎氏、時加訓斥</p>
<p>劉雁秋錦被血凝　當記者至郭宅訪問時、見衖口人山人海、爭看熱閙、捕房探員、持槍守門、記者抵郭家時、見事主郭椿森、危坐一隅、狀若痴癲、後由其侄郭蒼接見、言時不勝唏嘘、該宅爲二間一廂、屋内陳設、亦不十分富麗、後至樓上視察、見之不勝悲感、郭家少婦劉雁秋床上、錦被繡褥、均被鮮血沾染、淡綠印花綢被、半曳外面、流下之血、且已凝結、箱籠錦盒、雜亂不堪、床上帳頂、亦濺血跡、當係砍殺時、用力過重所致、繼復察視各室、均係滿地血污、慘不忍覩、聞其長孫蘇生、此次慘變中、得以幸免者、因其平日爲婢女從貴挈領、而從貴出走時、蘇生尚在安睡、</p>
<p>各捕房嚴重注意　公共租界各捕房以滬西發生如此重案、且情節離奇、事尤慘酷、實爲租界罕有之慘事、故各捕房中西探長探目、均先後馳往察勘、并在附近一帶照相館、帶領事主查看各種照相底片、以便嚴緝兇手到案、其郭家七屍、昨晨車舁斐倫路騐屍所、以時晏不及檢騐、定今晨報請特區法院蒞塲檢騐、</p>

<p>龍華燒香　匪等留待衖口之汽車、係自愛多亞路南京大戲院西首愛多汽車公司租來、其時間約早晨七時四十分左右、愛多汽車公司、來一身穿長服之中年男子、聲稱欲租車一輛、送往龍華燒香、客操本地口音、從容而談、並自稱爲僱車之老主顧、賬房不疑有他、即令車夫常州人薛阿根、開出一二五三八號（市五零九）之紫紅色别克轎車應客汽車開出、車行後、向西而出、車中人謂車夫先開至長沙路、尚有香客在彼等候、然後再往龍華不遲、車夫唯命是聽、即轉首向北且放長沙路而去、至青島路中、客即令車停止、等於衖口、</p>
<p>不堪回首　汽車停止路畔、爲時有二十分鐘之久、初無來者、車夫或以言詞向客剌探、客謂少待何妨、且言並有小孩、隨往龍華觀光、必因梳洗裝飾、多費時光矣、言次、搔首故作蹙額狀、似嫌守待無聊者、車夫信以爲眞、亦弗多言、孰知正在支頤枯坐時、忽覺有兩男子突如其來、躍上駕駛府、車夫薛阿根不禁大諤、方欲啓口相問、手槍已現於兩腰、知大事已去、即不敢聲張、兩匪登坐後、一取薛座而代之、一則坐於其左、並將車窗上可以返矚後面之迴光鏡、拔轉向内、俾車夫無回顧之憂、俄而突聞車門啓閉之聲、似甚迫促者、朱一安即於此時被匪挾上汽車、兩匪以手槍左右對車夫之腰、偶一動彈、掌頰立至、故雖聞其聲、而不堪回首一視也、</p>
<p>偵騎四出　朱一安被綁、汽車遭刦、兩事併發後、租界警務當局即四出偵查其下落、愛多汽車行並自放汽車往四鄉尋覓一二五三八號汽車、實則匪等將朱綁上汽車後、取道北京路外灘、至百老匯路、駛抵兆豐路口附近、匪煞車啓門、推令車夫薛阿根下車、然後駛去、瞬即無踪、一二五三八號汽車、直至下午三時許、始由虹口汽車行車夫報告愛多汽車行謂此車已在江灣路持志大學附近煤屑路上發現、乃會同新閘捕房探員、將車拖回、據虹口汽車行車夫言、上午十時許、行經江灣路、即見一二五三八號汽車停於路畔、當時忽忽而過、以爲機件損壞、而停止彼處者、因亦未加涼意、至下午三時許、重經其地、而汽車尚在原處、深以爲奇、乃用電話通知愛多車行云、</p>

<h3>特區法院審訊</h3>
<p>殺兄案兇犯</p>
<p>捕房經確實調查</p>
<p>孫世寳實殺其兄</p>
<p>拘捕時家人力阻</p>
<p>以妨害公務控訴</p>
<p>三人同被控向　皖人孫世寳·及孫夏氏·孫朱氏、因被控告殺人、昨晨、由特區地方法院吳推事開庭提審、據捕房律師汝保彝稱、被告孫世寳、於本年二月十二日上午五時三刻、將胞兄孫世林用斧殺死、查孫夏氏有兩子長世林、次世寳、朱氏係次媳、而長媳爲王氏、均住勞勃生路英華里一千七百五十三號、</p>
<p>疑兄與妻有染世寳業木匠、世林充德和輪船茶房、本年一月二十六日、世林回家、至二月九日旁晚、世林命弟媳孫朱氏將燈上樓、該氏旋在樓上尋物、稍久始與世林下樓、是時世寳歸家、見妻與兄同行、頓起疑竇、當晚與妻爭吵、</p>
<p>樓上之救命聲至十一日夜、世寳夫婦又口角、世寳對朱氏云、你們幹得好事、將來當將你們殺死、以洩急恨、語爲世林之妻所聞、次日十二晨、孫夏氏突聞世林在樓上呼救命之聲、當偕王氏登樓、見世林頭被斧傷、奄奄一息、遂報普陀路捕房、派探往查、世林尚能言語、未幾氣絕、</p>
<p>斧上猶有血痕　事後捕房以案頗離奇、着手調查得世林被害時、其家祇有孫夏氏·及孫世寳孫王氏·孫裴氏之夫孫春清數人、捕房將該四人帶至捕房、詢問之下並在該屋之灶間獲兇斧一柄、斧猶有血、故疑此案當係自己人所爲、然以未得證據、當將該四人暫釋、</p>
<p>咬破包探手指　世寳自經釋出、忽即失踪、是見彼係兇犯、乃請鈞院出票查緝、直至昨晚、偵悉世寳已歸、因往拿獲當探員至其家時、孫夏氏·孫朱氏·出而阻止、且將包探姚昌敏之手指咬破、故對該兩氏係控其妨害公務、</p>
<p>兇手確是世寳　據捕房查得被害人與其妻失睦已有五年、未曾同居、並與家人亦多不和、故孫夏氏當時竟不實述、且因一家恃世寳爲生、恐世寳被拘生計斷絕、惟被告今尚否認名世寳、自稱伊名夏少增、而稱孫夏氏爲姑母、於是孫夏氏亦不認其爲子、孫朱氏且不認其爲夫、但捕房確可證明被告係名孫世寳、毫無疑義也、</p>
<p>世寳力爲否認　旋將在孫家抄出世寳之照片呈案質之被告、果稱伊非孫世寳、實名夏少增、我與世寳世林係表兄弟等語、孫朱氏供伊夫世寳已死、吳推事復向孫夏氏略訊一過、諭被告分别還押、改期再訊、</p>

<h3>付之一笑海客·</h3>
<p>甲丨我生平最怕聽汽車上的喇叭聲。一聽得了就要膽戰心驚。</p>
<p>乙丨爲甚麽緣故。</p>
<p>甲丨因爲我的汽車夫盜了我的汽車。連帶將我那位雌虎似的夫人也盜去了。一年以來。如釋重負。但是一聽得喇叭聲。就怕他仍把伊送回來。所以禁不住膽戰心驚了。</p>
<p>甲丨我曾得過一頭極好的警犬。他見了紳士表示歡迎。一見歹人主會亂咬。</p>
<p>乙丨現在這頭狗在那裏。可能給我看看。</p>
<p>甲丨我已送了人了。因爲他時時咬我。</p>
<p>甲丨我公司中的男職員。差不多有一半人都愛上了我的女書記。</p>

<h3>蔣主席與童子軍　萬淵·</h3>
<p>此次全國童子軍總檢閱及大露營。蔣主席對之。以其可以表現黨治下新青年之精神。故提倡不遺餘力。赴漢之行。亦因之一再遷延此數日中。招待讌會。幾無虚日。自十八日總檢閱後。蔣主席即手諭軍校敎育長張治中。及勵志社。令竭誠招待。謂可使童子軍對革命。有認識與興感也。是日夜半二時。適值大雨。蔣乃於翌晨親赴營地慰問。臨時行。童子軍高呼蔣主席萬歲不已。是夜。蔣招待全體童子軍於勵志社。觀世界大戰影片。蔣偕夫人亦蒞塲。二十日蔣復用勵志社長名義。宴男童子軍約四百人。同時並由蔣夫人名義。宴女童子軍三百餘人。及哈爾濱男女選手數十人。蔣講勵志社與童子軍之關係。謂同負深潛内心的使命云。是日頻向各童子軍慰問勞苦。狀至愉快。二十一日復在軍官學校招待男女童子軍代表約五百人。並出席致訓。夜間復請童子軍往勵志社觀電影。二十二日童子軍行閉幕禮。蔣主席本定是晨啓節赴漢。因出席向全體男女童子軍訓話。延至十一時半始直赴碼頭登艦啓椗。臨别時。塲内四千童子軍齊鼓掌以送之。聲如雷震。蔣行久後。掌聲猶不絕。可謂盛矣。聞日昨蔣主席偶在途中。見幼年童子軍。嘗兩次下車殷殷慰問。笑容滿面。藹然可親。是以全體童子軍對蔣主席。無不感有絕大之印像也。</p>
<h3>說蕈　冰心·</h3>
<p>蕈一名菌。種類甚繁。多生沙土間。别有木生者曰檽。其名稱更因形似而名之曰馗廚連珠釘頭鵝掌等。昔人已有蕈譜載之綦詳。茲不復以抄胥手段。妄佔篇幅。姑說關於蕈之近事二則。爲衛生癖嗜兩家言之。冰心有舊僕任氏居蘇州。事母極孝。娶妻薛氏。二泉亭畔農家女也。亦能盡婦道。母嗜蕈。每當春日。薛氏必製蕈油數罐。以供甘旨。小姑阿玉年僅十二。與嫂亦素無忤。最近婦家有洗腆之慶。薛氏歸寗。母亦挈小女往祝。順道游惠山。及事畢回蘇。甫下車。母即嘔吐狼藉。扶掖歸家。隣右動問。母呻吟曰。今晨在惠山浜飯店食蕈一盤。色紅而黯。我固疑之。而婦言無碍。不知是否此物作祟。隣人羣聲和之。謂蕈之紅者。固含毒質。醫來。又人云亦云。且有危詞。任氏子責婦不愼。薛氏面無人色。無可置辯。幸阿玉雖幼。能排衆議。謂我亦食之甚多。何以不中毒。衆喙稍息。母亦經一晝夜。發壯熱得汗而解。蓋春寒停滯所致。然於宵分阿玉大聲疾呼。衆驚視之婦已投鐶。甫入圈套。又幸阿玉以母病移就嫂室睡。夜起更衣。見而得救。冰心按無錫產蕈多種。而猪血蕈味尤美無毒。曾就山麓酒家。自司烹飪。與酒友大嚼。並無所苦。而僕婦乃幾以身殉焉。此一事也。僕又言。母病方劇時。隣婦鈕氏云。去年春間蘇鄉有相城鎭。一老翁以鮮筍鮮蕈煑麵下酒。午而醉飽。夜而下世。死後左顴青黑色。家人痛之。以食餘筍蕈。傾而飼犬。犬無恙。又予丐。丐亦無恙。然翁素健無病。一睡而瞑。更無病狀。不歸獄於蕈。又將安歸。此又一事也。冰心願家居無化騐之學術者。寗垂三尺涎。母冒十分險。何如。</p>
<h3>體育家魏旭東猶健在彭積書·</h3>
<p>閱貴報自由談鄭逸梅胥梵兩君。所誌體育家魏旭東先生二段。兩君以靈活天矯之筆。寫魏先生絕世驚人之技。使天下未曾覩先生絕技者。如目見先生飛躍跳盪。顯好身手。可謂相得益彰。祇惜噩耗訛傳。使愛慕先生者。無端震悼先生。帮不可不予以更正。使知先生猶健在也先生世居湖南邵陽隆中鎭之金灘村。與予同里閇。兼屬姻親。故於先生少年事。知之較詳。至今父老道其故事。莫不昨舌驚奇。先生家於金灘村之獅子山下。與象嘴山隔河遥望。有長橋通焉。橋爲石砌。高一丈餘。一日先生游於橋上。羣童環繞。堅請一試身才。有鬻李者向前言曰。（君能從橋上一縱而下。再跳而上者。當盡舉所有李以餉君。）先生笑頷之。徐攬衣襟。縱身直下。立於沙洲。旣而騰脚飛起。已立橋沿。氣不喘。面不少赤。身軀輕捷。直如猿猱。羣兒掌聲雷動。爭以李啖先生。先生笑謂之曰。（吾豈貪李者耶。盡舉以還之可也。但須切記。從此勿輕視天下士耳。）又嘗居高樓。時因事外出。不待門啓。而先生已高臥樓上。於是鄉人益奇之。先生以清光緒末年。立功軍營。慕虎阜靈巖之勝。留吳中執掌敎鞭。越二十年未嘗一返里巷。雖耳熟先生大名。而實無緣一見也。</p>
<p>十六年冬余游鄂渚。適先生攫重病。挈眷來漢。始獲一面。越日先生返里。余亦有事東游。彼此遂怱怱别去。後有自鄉來者。詢悉先生因事鬱鬱於胸。居恒不樂。呻吟床榻之間。而不能起坐者。一載有餘。方爲天下惜之。近以事來游京都。寓花牌樓科巷湖南蔭餘善堂曾宅。適先生亦來訪友。乍見之餘。驚喜備至。細察先生面目。潔晳豐腴。了無病狀。與先生朝夕暢談。口滔滔若懸可。詢以逸梅胥梵兩君所云。不禁啞然狂笑。爰再誌之。以告兩君。兼以慰海内之愛先生者。使知先生猶健在也。</p>
<h3>記李吉瑞之宏碧緣　大·荒·</h3>
<p>宏碧緣一戲。爲李吉瑞所排演。後由吕月樵剽竊來滬。試演於大舞台。成績居然不弱。於是續排至十六本。即婦人孺子。亦無不知駱宏勛與花碧蘭之一段姻緣矣。然其精華所萃。全在頭本。而李吉瑞原本結搆之縝密。與夫詞句之雅潔。尤非吕月樵改頭換面之頭本所可比擬。此番李伶來滬。因恐原本之失傳。特重演於上海舞台。余以此戲原本之不可不觀。而且李氏年已六旬。又有不復再登舞台之意。重來之無日也。爰偷半日之暇。前往一觀。至則池中座無隙地。幸曾在第三排留得一席。否則殆無座可得矣。其時宏碧緣適上塲。李氏之駱宏勛。雖扮相似嫌年老覺遜書中人一籌。但其雍容華貴之態度。黄鐘大吕之噪子。則一一能將駱宏勛所具之個性。發揮無餘。做派邊式。唱句乾凈。打武敏捷。猶其餘事。固非一般野狐禪之駱宏勛。所可望其項背也。心有所感。因爲之記。</p>
<h3>參觀華隆中醫院　王·天·恨·</h3>
<p>海上西醫院不知凡幾。中醫院幾付闕如。而默察病家心理。信任中醫者實多於信任西醫。此固無庸諱言也。惟海上中醫雖夥。而具有眞學術。深入岐黄堂奥者。又寥寥可數。診例則勿論優劣。皆較内地爲昻。藥值亦然。幾超過内地數倍。職是之故。市民不能患病。貧苦賤役無論矣。即中人之家。一日醫藥。恒非四五金至十金不辦。向所患除風寒微恙外。又非一兩日間。所可霍然。進益之薪資旣絕。安有此巨大之存儲。得徐徐療治者。丁濟萬君。名醫丁甘仁先生後。家學淵源。杏林望重。近乃有鑒於斯。創華隆中醫院。頃承不棄。邀往參觀。院設於法租界華格臬路。地非鬧市空氣清新。闢病房若干室。設備如西醫院。有過無不及。而治療則純用中法。應診之醫士。爲程門雪劉佐彤馬壽民童少伯秦漢民趙百渝張劍秋。皆海上著名醫家。濟萬特其一耳。其最大特色。則爲優待寒素。（實則該院即爲寒素而設）。凡病者求診。祗納資小洋二角。手續極簡。赤貧者且施藥不計值焉。夫上述諸醫家。其診例固皆不廉。一般寒素。幾有望門却步。不敢問津之勢。今則薈萃一堂。備二角之微資。即可求診。市民有此。不啻於衛生問題得一安全保障。其嘉惠爲何如哉。據濟萬語愚。諸醫家皆敦聘而來。純盡義務。診金兩角。實不足抵開銷於什一。創辦之初。即慮不能持久。故於頭二等病房。稍昻其值。以資挹注云。</p>
<p>來函　頃閱自由談有捕鼠妙藥一則。此法係從戲法大全書上抄來。原名（白日聚鼠。）今謂乘夜深人靜之候。點火燃之。且須緊閉窗牗。庶香氣弗致外溢。方能奏效如神云云。查（閙楊花）乃麻醉性之毒藥。吾恐睡臥之人。嗅得些微之氣。早已人事不省。待至天明。人鼠均安睡而不醒矣。因末後有（居家者盍一試之）一語。或恐不明其藥性。貿然試之。受害不淺。務希將此函刋登報端。藉正其誤。樂農謹啟。</p>
<h3>鳥葬盛·</h3>
<p>烏葬之俗。不知起於何時。惟南史扶南國傳。有云。國俗死者有四葬。水葬則投之江流。火葬則焚爲灰燼。土葬則瘞埋之。鳥葬則棄之中野。按扶南國。即今之暹邏。然則鳥葬之俗。殆僅海外有之耶。不謂關外呼倫貝爾布哈特等處。訖今猶有鳥葬之遺習。</p>
<p>不佞有友。居東北幾五年。來信偶及呼倫貝爾布哈特鳥葬事。亟爲擷要如次。呼倫貝爾布哈特地方。人死主張鳥葬。厥法以屍身繫於野中樹枝上。一任鳥類之爭啄。其狀雖等於凌遲。但並不以爲慘酷。謂不如是。則人死後之靈魂。末由升天云。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（一）（七）（九）包·天·笑·</h3>
<p>第十回　赤燄騰天勾欄欽孝女　紅毹貼地即席晤名伶</p>
<p>柳星叔所訂的這位未婚夫人。却是吳興方家的大小姐。那吳興的方家。是一家大族。他們有好幾房。都正在興盛時代。上一輩的人。有在外國當公使的人。有在國内當顯宦的人。有在北京當闊差使的人。有在漢口當總辦的人。便是下一輩的子姪。也是出洋留學的出洋留學。大學生的大學生。銀行要職的銀行要職。高門大族。子姓繁多。中國人又一向相信大家庭制度。譬如有五房弟兄。偶然老太爺老太太在堂。他們照例不能分開。如其這五房也每房生五個兒子。便是二十五個孫子。再一娶孫媳婦兒。那也可以算一家人很多了。中國古時以五世同居爲美談。都是提倡大家庭制度的。那吳興方宅。也是一個大家庭的模範。我今且說柳星叔那一天很高興的和左詩晨說。我的姻事。大槪可以成就了。不想一個老同學。現在却做我的丈人峰。詩晨道。這是怎麽說。星叔道。我現在的未婚夫人。伊的父親方湘青。却是我在美國的老同學咧。不過他是學法律的。我是學經濟的。他比我早回國兩年。論起年紀來。他也比我大五六歲。我們在美國開玩笑的慣的。同學之中。也有知道他有一位美慧的女兒。大家還給伊說笑。如今却眞的做了我的岳父了。不免倒有些窘起來了。左詩晨道。現在的時代。滿不在乎。况且他是你的同學。究竟比你先兩年回國。還不是你的老前輩嗎。以老前輩爲丈人峰。正是恰到好處。想來你的未婚夫人。一定是個秀外慧中的人物了。你見過了没有呢。星叔道。談起來。我們和方家。也關着一點兒老親。他的這位小姐。是在中西女學校裏讀書的。說人是很聰明。什麽英文音樂都不差。人也是很漂亮的。我們在美國時。就知道他有這一位小姐。及至回國以後。我也見過幾回。不過就門閥而言。我覺得齊大非耦。他們方家是吳興的巨閥。我們是個寒士家風。吾父親是一個老秀才。雖然後來改營商業。然而終不脫書生本色。不比上海那班專以投機爲事的商家。至於我呢。剛在社會上做事。而且所用非所學。我自己毫没有一點兒積蓄。也不能因爲自己的姻事。煩勞吾們老人家。况且他已經說没有多大的力量。答應補助我一千塊錢咧。</p>

<h3>洋鈔銷胃日臻暢達</h3>
<p>市塲槪况目前現洋鈔票用途、以有數方面殷求、如茶繭·雜糧·軍需等、莫不盈數十萬之巨額、是故銷胃大暢、市氣奇旺、兼之月底伊邇、證券交割爲期匪遥、宜其趨勢格外優勝、不過現在籌碼、除現洋外、尚有鈔票佔大部份、故始終無慮不敷儘可如願供給、籌碼旣充則厘價當然無狂抬之必要耳、銀根方面、總有長期閙象、爲之點綴市景、無如收多放少、結果轉覺充斥市面、遂使銀拆、永無翱翔餘地矣、</p>
<p>厘拆價格（洋厘）早南仍爲七錢二分二　與前日相埒、人心大部安謐、午市忽然俏利、結果收盤價改昻二毫半、而爲七錢二分二厘二毫半（銀拆）銀根氣象之鬆繇來己久、目前在長期進出擁擠之候、以出欵多轉而下游、故銀拆終無轉機、昨日早午市仍爲四分、劃頭則爲二分</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋自前日忽有人吸收、以致價格狂抬後午市曾一度平復、迨至昨日、則甚爲冷淡交易僅早市一千五百角午市一千角而市價又至原狀爲六錢二分七厘半、早午輒同、廣東小洋、早市爲五錢九分九厘二毫半午市爲五錢九分九厘半、做出交易、早市十二萬角、午市七萬五千角銅元突又暴縮五千文、爲三百八十八千文、其縮風原因未詳、</p>

<h3>甬莊餘額改放繭墊欵</h3>
<p>寗波莊家夙在滬埠放出之長期額、總計不下二千萬、今年因市面不佳、己將一小部份收回、改做收繭墊欵、凡滬埠各大絲廠、均有承銷、即内地各絲廠亦有大批吸進、昨日放出約有二百餘萬、息價與銀行所放者大致相彷、並聞今明日尚須賡續進行、查其放額、據說有五六百萬之鉅云、</p>

<h3>棉市遭流言打擊</h3>
<p>散戸抛賣結果···造成懈怠局面</p>
<p>棉市平靜、形勢略爲鬆懈、但外棉近月仍漲、而本埠人心軟化、是乃環境不佳、紗廠流言孔多故散戸賣出以作未雨綢繆之計、但漢帮態度堅硬不欲放手云、</p>

<h3>糧食　河下米市轉定</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日裏路到船趨稀銷化平淡、北帮白粳、買氣極靜、店方須揀巧而進、零拆亦不興旺、惟大盤已轉定勢、故宿次等粳、較前日爲和緩、雖仍有見削者、然紙數分而已、總之後首來源恐稀、河下存船固有一百五十餘號、但斯項貨價成本均重、是以不肯甩售、刻下平米即將發賣、故粳市亦屬難好、全部情勢己呈久呆久擯之槪、况漲跌均不易也、薄稻晨銷活絡、午間陰雨帶靜、行情高挺次定、羊杜尖市上寥寥無幾、而銷塲亦因貨稀而沉寂、價格堅穏、白元到貨略接、去路仍以高者爲主、盤面無若何之升降、</p>
<p>滬南　到源寥寥、各帮銷場亦極平懈、蘇同帮機粳走銷不爽、價無上落、常錫帮機粳反有少數特銷、市氣趨堅、此間情况己與閘方並行矣、南帮練則等薄稻客胃呆木、到船凋零、行情平穏、羊杜秈由堅轉定、緣洋米步鬆、銷塲滯懈也、通變到銷兩敵、因無榮辱、陰元則酒坊胃暢、市見俏俐、高開十七元半左右、</p>
<h3>洋米初堅後跌</h3>
<p>跌後銷化又活</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、上午開價仍堅、惟進戸嫌大、多數觀望、市面隨見反動、各小近角、行情小後、銷化轉好、小絞開出五千包、價十五元二角半至十五元一角半、大絞三千包、價十五元一角半至十五元零七分、一號西貢一千包、價十六元至十五元九角半敏黨米五百包價十五元一角二三分、又糙米四千包價十四元八角六七分、茄拉地糙米一千包價十四元九角半、路貨有大絞三千、價十五元一角三分、小絞二千、價十五元一角八分、期貨開五月份小絞糙米五百噸、價六兩八錢云、</p>
<h3>遠期粉因雨趨堅</h3>
<p>内地帮繼續收買</p>
<p>昨日粉市呈近疲遠堅之象、本月份因交割伊　、浮多回出、且聞津帮曾開進現貨十七萬包、由福新抛出、在天津交貨、開申元二兩六錢三分、故對本月份標準、遂寂寞如常也、至遠期各月份、因天時又轉不佳、微雨止、内地帮依然逐步收買雖某廠曾有少數抛出、而買多於賣、市價終趨好面觀後步局面、本月份己將過去、當無問題可言、遠期因人心看好、一時未易轉平、或者因雨之故、再升一點、亦未可知也、結果本月份最低到二兩五錢三分、較前日小七釐半、五月份小二釐半、六月份至九月份各好起五釐云、</p>
<h3>期麥近遠俱俏</h3>
<p>現貨續開六千包</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、均又轉俏、本月份因收貨方面、如泰康一家、預備收五十車左右、不願交貨者祇得抵進故形勢比較見緊六月份以次、因天又降雨、雖洋麥報價小去二三角、人心依然堅勁、觀此後局面、因内地帮終以米價未平、始終扳緊、故後步尚看穏定也、結果本月份較前日好二分、六月份好二分、七月份未動、八月份好一分、九月份較小一分、現麥市况、仍然平定、福新阜豐兩廠、去胃尚殷、餘則未開、宿州麥·徐州麥·蚌埠麥·清江浦麥五兩零五分、漢口麥四兩五錢半、湖南麥四兩八錢至六錢三分、共開六千包云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　瓶窰蠶已三眠開葉</h3>
<p>天氣乍寒乍熱稍受影響</p>
<p>杭屬瓶窰長樂橋一帶、今歲因官廳加發改良蠶種、擴充飼額、蟻飼育不弱、催青時雖天氣寒冷、而用火力補温、尚無影響、現下早帮已三眠開葉多日、奈近數日陰雨連綿、加以氣候乍寒乍熱、以致蠶眠不起、間有下洩黑水、因蠶濕葉之故、葉價現開兩元八角</p>
<h3>期現絲均寂寞無神</h3>
<p>新繭廠經無甚問訊···現絲歐電亦仍不轉</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、期現各貨、類均寂寞無神、新繭廠經、往歲在新繭上市前、必已抛成數千包、今歲除美莊抛進中身貨數百包外、餘均觀望不前、現絲海外去電亦鮮見轉、市氣沈靜、價趨疲勢、昨市期現貨均無成交云、</p>
<h3>浙省新茶消息</h3>

<p>湖州茶市大熱鬧本埠土莊茶廠、年來經營湖州茶者、均頗順手、因之本年土莊茶商、對於湖州茶、大爲注意、前以泗安一帶、匪勢猖獗、茶商不敢前往、現下該處形勢和緩、各茶廠均紛紛派員携欵進山採辦、各路茶販、又多雲集其間、市面甚形熱鬧、山戸方面、自二十二日起均已開摘、惟因買方人氣濃厚、將來開秤、行情難望低廉云、</p>
<h3>糖市　泰源冰貨缺轉俏</h3>

<h3>疋頭　開水美雨布續漲二錢</h3>
<p>雨衣布以暮春時候爲最暢銷、今春開盤後、頻見上升、每碼己達四五錢之鉅、最近因單而貨同業中所存無多、售盤又漲二錢、如欲購辦原箱者尚不易得、頗有斷檔之虞、昨各牌一律售三兩八錢、回顧去臘二兩八九錢之價、相差已近一兩矣、</p>
<h3>五金　粗鉛絲猛漲不已</h3>
<p>十二號·十四號鉛絲、近來軍界收辦甚多以致到源鮮少之市貨、遂有供不敷求之勢、標準因青黄不接、步步高升、雖同業紛紛向海外收辦、但終因貨少市高一時尚難運到、是以本埠同業心思愈挺、而售價則猛漲不已、刻如十二號每担售九兩、十四號九兩五錢、均比前市好起三四錢不等、</p>

<p>社會消息</p>
<h3>婆羅洲土人的風俗</h3>
<p>在波濤掠岸的婆羅洲鳧上、住着好幾種野蠻民族這些民簇、直到現在依然滯留在原始狀態中、日與深山野獸爲伍、幾與現世相隔絕、他們住的是構造很簡單的篷寮、每年隨着農塲的更換而遷徒不定、穿的也很少用布料僅用一塊丈多長的樹皮緊裏着下身、不過女子却比較穿得豐厚些至若吃的、除了獵來的山禽野獸和魚肉外便是常年長着的樹葉、因爲該地土產很豐富、他們的慾望又不高、所以每日睡着都可過活、簡直一點也用不着愁慮、這大慨便是他們不長進的緣故吧、說到他們的風俗、更蒙上很澧厚的原始色彩種種不世上不易見聞的在他們的民間裏都還保存着、現正我且將比較有趣的幾種、一述於後、以窺見他們底風俗的一般、</p>
<p>聽鳥聲</p>
<p>在當地土人的民間裏流行着一種很奇怪的聽鳥聲的風俗只要他們一出門、無論在陸路上也好、水路上也好、都非常注意着鳥聲、從宛囀的呌聲裏他們可以分辯出此行的吉兇、這種迷信、極深刻的在他們的心靈上感應着、所以在中途要是聽到不利的鳥聲、他們寗可全工盡廢的、掉過頭來回到家裏、從這個現象我們可以想到他們對於鳥類底崇拜了、</p>
<p>但是他們所聽的鳥聲、並非不拘音節的也不是隨便亂聽的、如鳥呌的方向的時候、和呌聲的高低、這些都有關係的、若把這個詳細的說起來、眞是有趣只可惜我不太熟悉、所以在這裏只好暫付缺如了、</p>
<p>因爲他們崇拜烏類、所以懷有對鳥類不敢傷害的心思、如果有一個時候、在屋前或屋後的樹梢頭、飛來一隻爲他們所崇拜的鳥在整日徹夜的呌着於是他們就會不安起來、忙着拿了些餅菓走到那樹下去供獻、作着祈禱、他們自以爲這樣做了不但可以避去災難的降臨而且可以得福了、</p>
<p>他們的這種聽鳥聲的風俗、想來要不外由於那種崇拜自然的心所由引起的吧、</p>
<p>毒魚會</p>
<p>每年一到六七月、天氣就很乾燥、河裏的水也漸漸的退去了、這時候、他們就有毒魚盛會的舉行、在舉行之前、就由附近居民分担採取魚籐、所謂魚籐、係一種藤類植物、含有毒分、柞取其汁、能使魚類吃了暈迷若死浮到水面上來、任人刦取、待這種魚籐採到相當的限度、而且河水又退得很淺了、便共同訂下一個日子來、日子定奪了、大家都有幾乎歡忭、只希冀那日快點降臨、在這歡欣的氛圍裏、他們還得忙着備製各種長槍、講究點的、還把槍竿的尾部塗上各種顏色、或者繫上幾只小鈴、使在脫手投去時鈴鈴的響着、此外他們又得花費數天的工夫在河裏水較淺的部分用木橺圍起來、中間安置着一個大籠、這是防禦魚吃了魚籐水下竄時用的、</p>
<p>到了舉行那天、無論距離多遠的人家、都駛着中分大的船、一行三四人、向着舉行的地點駛來、通常遠道的在前一天就趕到這裏來、這一侂就在沙壩上過宿、到了第二天、晨光熹微的時候、大家便整裝待發、你笑我語、一種忘形的喜悅、激發了各個人的心腔等得出發的號令一下、大家便一齊將魚籐水抛向河水裏、接着便追蹤地順流而下、這時每個人都右手執着標槍伺候着魚浮到水面上來、所以說到獲魚的多寡、一半固要靠機會一半也要靠投擲的手法、他們這樣伺捕着、一直到暮色蒼茫、各人才對着用槍剌來的幾尾魚微微着、返到家裏來、</p>
<p>藏古甕</p>
<p>他們天生着一副愛好古甕的心腸、所以一有了積蓄、便企圖購買古甕、一只古甕的價值、賤的約十幾元、貴的却高至數千元的也有、自來保藏古甕的人家都是有錢有勢的、譬如村落裏的首領就要這輩人來充當了、</p>
<p>這般藏有古甕的人家、似乎都有舖張門面的虚榮、如每值有什麽宴會舉行時、便把所寳藏的古甕用紅布裝飾着、擺到宴會的地方來給客人鑒賞、這在主人方面、自然感到希有的嬌矜、而在客人方面、也自然難免在喞喞積羨了、</p>

<p>邇來各國海運界不振、相繼停船、而號稱海運國之英國、最受深刻之打擊、茲據某方面消息、英本國（今愛爾蘭）主要商埠之停船數如下、</p>
<p>合計　千噸以上英船</p>
<p>一九二九年一月一日　三·九、七一　二七九　三二六</p>
<p>十月十一日　三八五　九九七　二四六、二四</p>
<p>一九三○年一月一日　三五二、六九九　三二七、三八七</p>
<p>即本年一月一日、較去年一月一日增二二、八八八噸（百分之六·九四）、較去年十月一日增八六·六二二噸（百分之三二·五八）、而於一千噸以上之船舶、尤爲顯著、計較去年十月一日約增八一·一○○噸（約百分之三三）、又較去年一月一日增四八、（○六一噸（百分之一七·二一）、其原因於大宗貨物小麥之本期收穫、世界主要產地均大减、輸出餘力低下、而需要地歐洲之耕種尚不惡、致出貨漸減、又阿根廷等之玉蜀黍未至出貨期、加之各國經濟界由一二年之盛况轉入反動的衰微狀態、由海運市塲不振、運費低落、船主捨斷行停船外、别無他策云、</p>
<h3>馬來底戲劇ＹＳ</h3>
<p>（馬來戲比中國戲好得多）、任誰也不會相信一點文化都没有的愚蠢的馬來民族的戲劇會得到觀衆如此的稱讚、假如你没有到過南洋看過馬來戲的話、</p>
<p>馬來民族的音樂和歌舞的天才、可以說是天哥賦予的、他們的戲劇、據說是起源於印度、但能把印度的戲劇、容化爲己有、另創出一種馬來的戲劇來、這是很值得令人們欽敬的事、</p>
<p>馬來戲劇的材料、也多採自印度的民間傳說與故事等、哀艶的劇情、則比較佔多數我們也很可以說馬來的戲劇、十有九是（哀艶劇的）這種（哀艶劇）、對於時代的潮流、自然是不甚適宜的了、然而、我們却很可當作一篇文學作品欣賞呢、加之劇情的編製、多編插入動人的情歌、而音樂則純係採取歐美的樂器、其歌聲之蜿囀動人、眞是難得、因此、我們一方面又很可以看出了馬來的人善於利用的手腕和改良的精神來了呢、</p>
<p>馬來戲的演員、男女皆有、男的去男角、女的去女角、並不像我國的男的可去女角、而女的又可以去男角似的、表情與做作之賣力、均是很可令人滿意、至於劇塲的佈景、則力求逼眞、雖一花一草、都要維肖維妙方能放過、我國的戲劇界、不知對於他們這種精神有什麽感想、</p>
<p>最後、我還希望我國的戲劇努力、使南洋華僑的觀衆、把（馬來戲比中國戲好得多）這句話取消了吧、</p>
<h3>馬來人的降頭　時·鐸·</h3>
<p>降頭一語、爲吾僑胞所習用、其意義爲秘藥、說起馬來人的秘藥、其利害眞難以想見、往往能於不知不覺之間、使你的四肢或身體的某部分、成爲殘廢甚至把你的生命送掉、且於施行此種秘藥時、竟神乎其技、難以捉摸使人無從防備、所以一般與他們來往的僑胞們、都很怕有什麽地方悔辱了他們、怕他們玩弄降頭的把戲、因爲馬來人是尚未脫除野蠻狀態的民族氣量很狹小、雪恨的心思、很容易在他們的胸腔裏鼓動起、所以一旦你如悔辱了他們、他們就懷恨在心、伺機執仇、</p>
<p>他們不但用此降頭來雪恨、且有用以求愛或是維護菓樹的、如他們看中了某少女、但以因爲種種的關係不能得到她的歡心、於是他們就使用降頭或者用油抹到她的肉上、或者畫符使她跨過、少女中了降頭、就會如痴如醉的熱愛起這個男子來、不復有先前的拒避的態度了、說來這是多麽神秘而又奇異的呵、至於用來維護菓樹、說來更是有趣、譬如有一座菓林、滿樹都結了實、怕人家偷採、於是他們便將此秘藥藏到菓樹跟上、使偷者接觸到了樹跟、便不能遠離一步、或是回到家裏不能有好的結果、</p>
<p>因爲降頭的用處有好多方面、所以說到其種類、自亦有好多種、而製造此種毒物的原料、也各因其種類不同而異如山林中的毒草毒木、果實的槳汁、動物的骨髓、都是配製降頭的材料、聽說其毒物的最著而酷烈的、莫如毒樹之汁、名叫Ｉplb　Batang、取時鑿穴於樹、用竹管裝其所流下來的汁然後雜以某種草根的漿汁而合煮之、使蒸化其水、而結成固體、便可以使用了、</p>

<h3>油畫之研究前言</h3>
<p>陳·抱·一·</p>
<p>我數月前看見（油畫之研究）一書這本書是日本美術雜誌ＡIRLIER社從幾年來所徵求而登載過的名家論文之中、選集二十五家所述的四十講題而編成的、我看完之後、覺得這本書頗足供研究洋畫的表年的參考因爲這幾十篇短文俱是記述着關於研究上及製作上的要點、有的是述及製作上的經騐、有的是說明材料上的使用方法、有的能使我們在研究進程上感受一種新的暗示、尤其在東方人研究油畫的立塲上考慮之點足使我們悟得應取的進路、所以我覺得這本書、給我們東方人的研究者、是一種很適當的南針、因此我覺得很值得介紹於我們的青年同志、我便於工作餘暇從事譯寫現在將近譯完我想幾時或有機會可以綴成一書</p>
<p>原文的作者多爲近時日本洋畫壇的健將、例如山本鼎梅原龍三郎中川紀元、萬鐵五郎（已物故）、奥村博中川一政林倭篃鍋井克之（餘從略）等等每篇均含着作者即畫家自具的特色所以我譯時覺得如其爲了習慣的讀法起見而任意將原作者的辭色改譯、致不能夠使閱者感得原文的神氣、則反違背譯者的心願而且是對不起原作者的所以我一面雖感到自己的疎拙而仍要努力試將原文傳出、因此或許其中有些語句在閱者看來覺得難解一些、然而我覺得依據上述的原因似乎是不得已的故特請閱者原諒</p>
<p>也像原書序中所謂（至於將從本書裏發見何種金言去怎樣的應用、這是閱者諸君研究的範圍了、）還有、原文中有種種專門術語及比較難明之點譯者都加以註釋、趁現在的機會、我先選譯稿中的數篇在這里發表、又、這本書的姊妹篇（素描之研究）我也預定順次發表、</p>

<h3>巴比尼曼·如·</h3>
<p>現代意大利文學家</p>
<p>以（基督傳）（Ｓtoria　id　Cristo）轟動歐美的意大利作家巴比尼（Giovanni　Papini）如今又因突然出版了一部（聖奥格斯丁）（Ｓand　Agostino）而重新引起世人底注意、趁現在這時候、來約略地介紹介紹這位爲我們所不太熟悉的意大利文豪似乎是還合宜的吧、</p>
<p>在一九○六年、巴比尼以他的短篇小說集Ｔragico　Quotidiano和評論集ＩＩＣrepuscolo　die　Filosofi開始了他的著作生涯、约主年是很重要的一年、舊的卡都昔安的Ｏttocentismo是分裂起來了、批評肻的克羅且（Ｃrcce）已經上了台、而馬里奈特（Ｍarinetti）和未來派是正在地平線邊、在哲學上呢、實騐主義已經遭受了顯著的潰敗外國新學說的介紹、大生影響、威廉及姆司（Ｗilliam　James）底實用主義就是其中之一、但是柏格森（Ｂergson）底哲學在這半島上却没有多大的進展、這種現象可以說是表現了今日西歐南部和北部思想上的顯著的差别、實際上是、詹姆司底學說是和現代意大利底如詩的·英雄的特性溶合了、產生了一種十九世紀新理想主義、我們這位自視爲一創造主）（Ｄewiurge）的巴比尼、在這時候登場、眞是適逢其會了、</p>
<p>不過、如果說巴比尼底文學事業是當他的作品在一九○六年初次出版時開始的、却又不很正確、因爲、確切地說起來、他的文學事業是開始於三年前、當他創辦而且主持那個愛爭辯的、抱實用主義的IILeonardo期刋時、這是二十世紀初年佛羅倫蕯文藝復興的特色之一、這個刋物是典型的忒斯堪（Ｔuscan）言論機關、但從一九○三到一九○七年、辦了五</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>年光景就停頓了、到了一九○八年、ＬaVoce創辦了、巴比尼後來做過這個刋物的編輯人、在這兩種刋物裏、批評家的巴比尼逐漸進化着、這是一位（自我批判）的批評家、藝術作品及其短處的評斷者、他的猛烈的氣勢使他的風格有一種不優雅的情態和個性表現、至於他的風格、那時是顯著地具有故意的粗卑和蠻野、以及新浪漫派和未來派底曖昧辭句、然而從這亂雜的風格之中、將來却是要產生一位用（誠懇的修辭）來說話、用驕昻的謙卑來遮掩他的誠懇的、批評家後來、大約在一九一○年的時候、一場的崩壞發生了、巴比尼經過了心靈上的太危機、那時似乎思想生活藝術都使他大失望了、他以前的理想主義已破碎無餘、他的悲劇是一個意志堅强的人底悲劇、他已經測探出意志底最大的可能性、他已經發現此外是只有（死亡·瘋狂·或寺院）、他的頭一個本能的舉動就是遁逃、他想創造出一個外在的價值、在自我以外的價值、結果我們看到了他的Ｌaltra　Meta、在這本書裏、他試去建立一種否定和矛盾的哲學、但並没有得到什麽成功、這在他於同一年所發表的自傳Ｕn　UomoFnito裏就明白地可以看到、</p>
<p>這一個時期繼續了一些時候、大戰前的幾年是巴比尼最感受痛苦的幾年、老Ｖoce、那個文學政治哲學的言論機關、執筆者包含許多文學家哲學家的、在一九一年、大戰的前夜、就此死去了、在同一年、巴比尼和蘇菲且（Ｓolfici）雖然創辦了Ｌrcerbe、但這個刋物也在一九一五年被大戰奪去了生命不過、這兩個刋物雖然都已逝去、巴比尼在它們的篇幅中、却立下了不可磨滅的功績、他打出了民族文化的根基、瀰佈了新的智識的氛圍氣、他打倒了舊的觀念、煽起了新的思想、可是、厭恨的情調毫不因此而减少、始終是他文章裏的主要情調、</p>
<p>從這一切之中、浮現出一個更好的詩人來、他在大風暴過去以後、才發現他和那些英雄氣槪·亂殺亂斫的青年人有許多相同的地方、這也許是戰爭的緣故吧、但在戰後一切破敗之中、巴比尼仍然是個巴比尼、他的個性一點也没有消失、還是以前那樣的性格、</p>
<p>戰後的巴比尼是以傳記作品馳譽世界的、對於巴比尼、傳記的意義就是詩他以前說過傳記的題材該是一種（智的東西）、這話現在看來是頗可懷疑的了、其實是、他所注意的是（那活而完全的現實、就是個性）、他自己是個個性最强烈的人、所以他把個性看這最重要的東西、他是從自傳來看歷史的、是從個人底性格來看取社會底全般色相的、他告訴我們說、過去時代的偉大人物都是一些歷史的片斷、從這些片斷我們可以找到我們自己、它們又是一些屍體、對於這些屍體、我們要灌入我們的生命的呼吸、</p>
<p>這話、在看了他的（奥格斯丁）之後、我們相信是不錯的、從聖奥格斯丁、那個（歷史的片斷、）巴比尼不是找到了他自己嗎、對於聖奥格斯丁、那個過去時代的（屍體）、巴比尼不是灌入了他的生命的呼吸、使他成爲一個有靈的活人嗎、巴比尼傳記作品之成功、多半就在那兩句話上吧、</p>
<h3>湯麥斯曼底中篇名著</h3>
<p>過早的悲哀　曼·如·</p>
<p>戰後德國之幻滅情態的表現</p>
<p>凡是湯麥斯曼所寫的東西、在德國總是得到恭而敬之的熱烈歡迎、所以這部長的（短篇小說）、三年前發表出來時、雖然不及他的中篇傑作（威尼斯之死）（Ｄer　Tod　in　Venedig）、但是仍然得到非常的歡迎、不過、外國人看起這部小說來、恐怕不會橡德國人那樣的親切有味吧、爲它含蓄着一種特殊的感傷情緒、表現着戰後德國底普遍的幻滅心理、它凄凉地寫出大戰以來幾年之内、破落窮困的德國職業階級與智識階級底家庭生活和日常情緒這種情况寫是寫得逼眞的、在現在聽起來都還覺得眞實、但那瀰佈書中的苦悶悲鬱的心理和氛圍氣、却非自身有過這種經騐的不能體會到、所以外國的讀者、是不會從這部小說得到濃烈的興趣的、但是我們如果要知道戰後德國的一般心理和普通生活那這部小說却是一部極適當的書、（英譯本名ＥarlySorrow倫敦Ｍartin　Seckea出版、價五先令）</p>
<p>這部小說底結構很單薄、其中所發生的事件很微小、大略是這樣的、有一位歷史敎授高乃列司、有兩個兒子、伯脫和英格列特、這兩個青年在家裏舉行了一個宴會、招待他們的朋友、他們都是落拓不覊、幻滅得厲害的青年、感覺非常地敏銳、但情緒却又非常地冷酷、他倔底性格都是被大戰所造成而且被大戰磨練硬了的、他們都有人生短促青春杳逝的感覺、他們都抱着及時行樂的念頭、他們的這種心情是和大多數的青年相同、譬如在他們的滿座高朋之中、一大半就是和他們存着同樣心思的、且說其中有一個、一個很平常的青年、和他們的小妹妹、敎授底愛女、愛列、跳舞了幾次、他和她尋尋開心、談談戀愛、引逗了她一下、在他不過是逢塲作戲、所以不久就忘掉了這個小女孩、忘掉了這件事、然而那個小女孩却似乎早熟得很、大受挑動、因此對於他後來的冷淡覺得很傷心、就哭了起來、大人們看見這小孩子忽然哭起來、不知這是爲了什麽、當然就用了對付小孩子的老辦法、送她去睡覺了、但是她仍舊哭着、任怎樣安慰也安慰不好、尤其是她父親底撫慰、使她各外傷心、這老敎授覺得莫明其妙、對於他愛女底古怪的悲哀、弄得無法可想、到後來、那個闖禍的少年、知道了這件事、猜到其中的緣故就到愛列底臥室裏去、吻她、安慰她、在床邊陪她、一直陪到她睡着、這是愛列第一次嘗到人生底悲哀、但是、嘗得太早了、</p>
<p>故事底主體大槪如是、情節當然是很簡單的、不過書中充滿着深廣的思想、所以决不是一部淺薄空虚的作品、在這部小說裏、我們看到那代表父代的老敎授底心理、雖然不和子代的青年們底心理相衝突、却是始終不一致的、他一面爲他的子女預備宴會的佈置、一面却思索到這個宴會對於他、一位歷史敎授、有什麽意義呢、他的心是屬於那個（有條理有紀律的歷史的過去）的、眼前的這種放弛過度的現在對於他是不和諧的、他覺得丨丨</p>
<p>過去是不朽了的、這就是說、過去是死了、而死就是一切的神聖、一切的持久的意義底根源、</p>
<p>過去的一切是過去了、而現在的一切却又和過去的大異、青年人底心理和老年人底心理相差得是很遠很遠的、但老年人對於（現在）却不必抗拒、（現在）是青年們底疆域、（過去）的世界才是老年人的、雖則已經過去了、然而、（過去是不朽了的、）這就是老人們底心理、</p>

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Goes to Yancheng to Inspect Defenses</h3>

If this unrest is not quelled, the Party and the nation will be uneasy.

<h3>Yan Orders Troops to Advance South</h3>
<p>Xu Yongchang and Yang Aiyuan Go to Taiyuan</p>

A majority of Party members are now being convened in Taiyuan, and a joint declaration will be issued soon. As for finance, Yan Xishan said that income and expenditure are balanced. He now receives funds directly from Yan Xishan. Although there are 700,000 troops, the actual monthly expenditure is only two to three million yuan. Recently, Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan can collect more than one million yuan per month, and it does not feel insufficient. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

On the surface, it seems to have been completely settled, but in reality, they are sleeping in the same bed with different dreams.

(2) The Shanxi army has built strong trenches more than sixty li west of Shijiazhuang, specifically to prevent Feng Yuxiang from attacking. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Report on the Stalled British-Egyptian Negotiations</h3>
<p>The outstanding issues between Britain and Egypt following Egyptian independence, which have remained unresolved despite repeated meetings that have frequently teetered on the brink of crisis, are now being addressed. Both sides are eager to reach a swift resolution, which is why the Egyptian people wholeheartedly welcomed the Egyptian delegation upon their departure for Britain, and the British people extended a sincere welcome as well. Unexpectedly, the negotiations have been stymied by the Sudan issue, which has proven to be the greatest obstacle. According to foreign news reports today, the Egyptian cabinet, following an all-night meeting, issued a declaration stating that the government would not alter its demands regarding the administration of Sudan, and the British side has shown no indication of making concessions. Therefore, these British-Egyptian negotiations are likely to be unsuccessful once again.</p>
<p>The reason why Sudan has become an intractable problem is that it has a direct bearing on both Britain and Egypt. Sudan lies to the south of Egypt and is extremely fertile. It had long been ruled by Egypt. Since the rebellion in Sudan in 1882, Egypt, with British assistance, quelled the unrest, leading to a situation of joint British-Egyptian administration. The dispute arose from this situation. However, Egypt believes that both historically, Sudan has a relationship with Egypt, and geographically, Sudan is located in the upper reaches of the Nile River and naturally belongs to Egypt. Moreover, it is the source of Egypt's water supply. Egyptians often say that Egypt's supply of Nile water is not a matter of convenience but a matter of life. If the right to govern Sudan is in the hands of others, there is a risk of being oppressed at any time. Therefore, Egypt has consistently refused to relinquish its claim. On the British side, they believe that the British have invested heavily in Sudan and have worked hard to promote Sudan's industrial development after its occupation, repairing dikes, opening canals, and building railways. They believe that retaining Sudan is beneficial to controlling navigation rights from the Red Sea to India and from the Cape of Good Hope to Cairo, which is greatly beneficial to Britain's foundation. Therefore, they are also unwilling to let go without a fight. The vested interests of both Britain and Egypt in the Sudan issue are such that since Egypt's independence until the most recent agreement negotiations, both sides have never shown any signs of compromise and have regarded it as a legitimate dispute. Although there have been many proposals for mediation, some suggesting that the issue be resolved by the League of Nations, and others suggesting that Sudan be divided into two, with each part being under the jurisdiction of Britain and Egypt, both have been rejected by Britain and Egypt, insisting on adhering to their own demands. Therefore, in terms of the situation, there is no good solution to this problem. However, prolonged confrontation will only increase animosity. Moreover, the internal situation in Sudan is also quite unstable. Anti-British movements are likely to reappear. The more disputes there are, the harder it will be to resolve them. Is it not more worrying for diplomatic relations?</p>

<h3>Shidehara's Diplomatic Speech</h3>
<p>Referring to the London Naval Treaty</p>
<p>Opposition Party Shouts "Traitor"</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo dispatch, 25th: Foreign Minister Shidehara delivered a diplomatic speech today in both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives. The main points are as follows: Regarding Sino-Japanese relations, the tariff agreement has already been signed. The main points are the recognition of China's tariff autonomy and the implementation of reciprocal tariff rates on certain traded goods. China's tariff autonomy has been fully recognized by all related countries. This is because the countries deeply believe that China will never use its new position to abuse changes in tariff rates that persecute or destroy foreign trade. In addition, China and Japan have agreed to maintain certain tariff rates for certain traded goods for a certain period of time, which does not conflict with tariff autonomy. This is merely the normal exercise of national sovereignty. Recently, due to unrest in China's domestic political situation, there have been rumors that Japan has some kind of relationship or plan in this matter. These are rumors and not to be believed. Japan has always maintained an absolutely fair attitude, which is well known at home and abroad and need not be said further. Japan has always sought to conclude new treaties with countries with whom it has not yet signed commercial treaties. Japan and Egypt signed a provisional commercial agreement on March 19. Similarly, we also want to establish similar treaty relationships with other markets. The London Naval Conference was signed on the 22nd of this month to seek international peace and friendship, and we sincerely welcome it. During its period of validity, the London Treaty will prevent all naval construction competition, not only reducing the burden on the people, but also having an extremely positive impact on the spirit of international relations, without a doubt. The London Treaty regulates the situation until the end of 1936. Future matters must be decided at a conference in 1935. Because the world situation is constantly changing, at the 1935 conference, Japan has the need to reserve the freedom to assert its demands according to the situation at that time. This point has been clearly acknowledged by the treaty. In the regulations of this London Treaty, there is nothing that the Japanese side must contend for even if it means rupture. Therefore, it is imperative to coordinate with the nations to seek the success of the conference. The world says that Japan's coordination is being oppressed by other countries, which is a complete misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo dispatch, 25th: This afternoon, when Foreign Minister Shidehara was stating the London Naval Treaty in the House of Representatives, opposition party members all shouted "Traitor" to obstruct him. However, the Foreign Minister eventually finished reading his speech amid the cheers of his party and the angry rebukes of the opposition party. Seiyukai leader Inukai Tsuyoshi then began the opposition party's attack on the cabinet, saying that the cabinet accepted the terms of the naval treaty, disregarding its previous promises to emphasize national defense. The Prime Minister replied in firm words that the cabinet was willing to bear the responsibility for the security of the country.</p>
<h3>Spain Expresses Opposition to Naval Reduction</h3>
<p>Guomin News, Madrid dispatch, 24th: Spanish Naval Chief of Staff Garcia declared today that although the results of the London Conference are sufficient to encourage disarmament, Spain must have appropriate self-defense capabilities in its navy to protect the Peñon de Vélez de la Gomera and the Canary Islands. He also stated that the Spanish Navy will soon hold maneuvers. From these words, we can see that Spain will continue its naval construction program.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Municipal Electric Railway Labor Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>Tamaki Mint Factory Announces Another Strike</p>
<p>Nichiren News Agency, Tokyo dispatch, 25th: The leaders of the Tokyo Municipal Electric Railway dispute group, Shinoda, Kumamoto, Ono, and Yamashita, met with Tokyo Mayor Horikiri at 11:40 AM on the 25th and announced the cessation of the strike movement. The turmoil that had lasted for six days was thus resolved. The strike group immediately issued a statement saying that the failure of this strike group was due to internal disunity within the union. One hundred and twenty-five people were sacrificed due to the defection of the right wing, and they will never be able to return to work. In the future, internal disputes within the union will be inevitable, and the division between the left and right wings will also be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo dispatch, 25th: Workers at the Masugane factory in Kawaguchi Town, Saitama Prefecture, demanded a pay increase and improved treatment from the factory owner, which was rejected. They continued their siege strike inside the factory. Yesterday afternoon, the police station suddenly dispatched a police inspector and more than twenty police officers to surround the factory. They drew their swords and ordered the workers to leave the factory. The workers were angered and resisted, resulting in more than ten people on both sides suffering serious and minor injuries, who were immediately sent to nearby hospitals for treatment. On the workers' side, a representative of the proletariat party accompanied them to Tokyo to give a detailed account to Interior Minister Adachi and lodge a protest. They even accused the Saitama Prefecture police chief and related police officers of violating human rights. The locals also believe that the police's handling was inappropriate and held a meeting to oppose it.</p>
<h3>Course of French Infantry Mutiny</h3>

<p>Continuing Resistance for Three Days</p>
<p>Paris Dispatch: On March 20 of this year, a mutiny occurred at the infantry training station on the island of Oléron off the coast of Rochefort, France. At the time, the government prohibited newspapers from publishing this news. This news has only recently been published in the official gazette. It is said that the mutinous soldiers gathered in a barracks, closed the doors, destroyed items, sang military songs, and insulted the officers. To avoid bloodshed, the officers surrounded the barracks and ordered the mutinous soldiers to surrender. A portion of them obeyed and surrendered, while several leaders refused and resisted for three days. Among the leaders was someone who had been a naval officer and was involved in the Garve mutiny. The official gazette denies that the mutiny was due to a lack of food or excessive operations. (World)</p>

<h3>European Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>And British and German Political Situations</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent Hua Lu)</p>
<p>Production Expansion and Increased Unemployment</p>
<p>Economic Crisis Affects Political Situation</p>
<p>Ascension of German Right-Leaning Cabinet</p>
<p>Current Situation of British Labour Party Cabinet</p>
<p>The abnormal phenomena caused by the war in the European industrial sector have almost completely disappeared. The industry, commerce, and finance of various countries have all returned to the pre-war normal, and at the same time, fierce industrial competition has also followed, even more so than before the war. This industrial competition produces two inevitable bad results, namely the excessive expansion of industrial production and the continued increase in worker unemployment. These two are the most pressing issues in Europe today. All political changes and social disturbances are closely related to these two issues.</p>
<p>Currently, the industrial production of major European industrial countries has increased far more than before the war. Although the purchasing power of the people in various countries has also increased at the same time, it is by no means enough to consume this excessive production. The majority of industrial products rely entirely on the world market to supply their discharge. However, after the war, American industry and commerce flourished, occupying an important part of the world market. The development of Japanese industry and commerce also occupies a large part of the Far Eastern market. At the same time, the purchasing power of Russia and Eastern Europe has greatly declined after the war. Therefore, the products of major European industrial countries are inevitably in a state of oversupply. In order to protect their industry and commerce, various countries continue to increase import tariffs to resist foreign goods. However, although raising tariffs can protect the domestic market, other countries, in retaliation, inevitably build high tariff barriers to counter this. For example, in recent years, the United States has continued to increase tariffs to exclude European goods, and European countries have returned the favor by increasing their own tariff rates to avoid the encroachment of American goods. At the same time, there are also similar tariff wars between European countries. The result of this tariff war is that the sales of industrial products are becoming increasingly stagnant. Last month, the League of Nations convened a tariff conference of European countries to conclude a short-term tariff truce between European countries, but due to conflicting interests among the countries, the results were insignificant. Even if all countries abandon their protectionist policies in a free competition situation, the current world consumer market still cannot accommodate this large-scale industrial production that is increasing day by day. Therefore, major European industrial countries are currently experiencing an economic crisis. Many industries cannot survive due to a lack of sales. At the same time, as a result of the strict implementation of rationalization, industrial organizations that are more primitive and backward find it even more difficult to stand firm. The result is that the number of unemployed workers is increasing day by day. The economic crisis thus promotes a social crisis.</p>
<p>Currently, the only major industrial country that can avoid unemployment panic is France. France has a slower population increase, agriculture has not collapsed, and industrial development has been very rapid after the war, so there is no unemployment problem for the time being. In addition, all other countries are experiencing the difficulties of unemployment. America's prosperity after the war was the greatest in the world, but this year the number of unemployed workers has increased to five million. The situation is even worse in European countries. This starving and freezing unemployed masses not only become the most pressing social crisis, but also affect the political situation in various countries. The political instability of various countries and the lack of time for cabinets to warm their seats are mostly promoted by this economic and social crisis. The recent internal political changes in Britain and Germany are the most obvious examples. The Mühl mixed cabinet in Germany recently collapsed, and Bruning of the Catholic Centre Party reorganized a right-wing mixed cabinet. The Müller cabinet was formed by the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, the Catholic Centre Party, the People's Party, and the Union. Its color was somewhat left-leaning, advocating peace externally and labor-capital compromise internally. However, due to differences of opinion among cabinet members, it had long been on the verge of dissolution. The opposition Nationalist Party attacked the government in the parliament and in the media, sparing no effort. However, the Young Plan and the German-Polish trade agreement were eventually passed in the parliament. This cabinet change was entirely due to financial problems. The 1930 German budget's income fell short of expenditure by 450 million marks. People's Party cabinet members representing large industrial and commercial owners advocated reducing subsidies for unemployed workers and increasing taxes on consumer goods in order to balance the budget. The Social Democratic Party opposed this. The two sides' opinions could not be reconciled, so the cabinet resigned. President Hindenburg then ordered Bruning, leader of the Catholic Centre Party, to form a cabinet. The Bruning cabinet was completed at the end of March. Its members were composed of the Democratic Party, People's Party, and Catholic Centre Party members from the previous cabinet, plus the central and right-wing parties in the parliament. It was a purely right-wing cabinet. After the Bruning cabinet was formed, the extremely right-leaning German National People's Party maintained a good-will neutral attitude, while the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party were in opposition. The new cabinet appointed the famous Schiele as the Minister of Food, seeking to win the support of the farmers, and at the same time prepared to propose a financial plan to reduce direct taxes and increase indirect taxes. In short, the new cabinet is a cabinet that leans towards the bourgeoisie and will vigorously protect the interests of entrepreneurs. Based on the current industrial situation in Germany, the total number of unemployed workers has reached more than three million. Although the Social Democratic Party has lost power, it will make every effort to compete with the government. The new cabinet advocates dissolving the parliament and holding new elections when necessary. It can be seen that the political changes in Germany are just beginning, and the economic and social crisis is the main reason for promoting the internal political disputes in Germany.</p>
<p>Britain also has a similar situation to Germany. Although the British Labour Party is stronger than the German Social Democratic Party, in the parliament, it relies entirely on the compromise and cooperation of the Liberal Party to maintain the life of its Labour government. Since the MacDonald cabinet took office, it has been nearly ten months. In terms of foreign affairs, such as the Anglo-American compromise and the restoration of relations with Russia, it has achieved considerable success. However, in terms of domestic affairs, it has been thwarted by the economic difficulties and has not yet found a way out. The unemployment problem is the point of greatest concern for the Labour government. The Labour Party was able to win in last year's election because the majority of voters hoped to reduce the number of unemployed people. However, since the Labour Party came to power, all relief methods have been ineffective. The number of unemployed workers has increased day by day. As of March of this year, the number of unemployed people in Britain reached more than 1.6 million, which is the highest in eight years. The Labour Party has not been able to occupy more than half of the seats in the parliament and cannot propose more radical socialist policies, engaging only in piecemeal solutions, so it is inevitable that its efforts are in vain. Its domestic policy difficulties cannot be denied. Its survival depends solely on foreign policy. However, the London Naval Conference, advocated by MacDonald and Stimson, has been in session for three months, with numerous disputes. The results have been minimal. Based on the current situation, there is no room for compromise between France and Italy. Even if the naval conference avoids rupture, it will at most achieve a short-term agreement between Britain, the United States, and Japan. Recently, the Labour government's proposals in the parliament have been repeatedly rejected by a majority. Fortunately, it can be maintained by the compromise of the Liberal Party. The solution to the economic crisis is the most important point in determining the direction of British politics in the future. Because the current industrial crisis has intensified social struggle. Because of this social struggle, it has affected politics, causing the political situation to fall into instability day by day. This is a phenomenon shared by both Britain and Germany.

<h3>Commander-in-Chief Chiang Arrives in Hankou</h3>

<p>Preparations for the Welcome: Upon hearing the news of Commander-in-Chief Chiang's arrival in Hankou, all sectors of Wuhan immediately established a Preparatory Committee for the Welcome. They decided on welcome methods, notified all agencies, groups, and schools to gather at the Sanbei Company pier to welcome him, and notified all shops to hang flags and all warships to fire salutes. At the same time, they arranged the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters in Yang Sen's Garden and the venue in Zhongshan Park. Arches were erected at the Sanbei Company pier, Jianghanguan pier, Yiyuan, and the entrance to Yang Sen's Garden. Paper and cloth banners were hung on all major thoroughfares, and more than one hundred thousand copies of declarations and open letters to comrades and compatriots were printed and distributed.</p>
<p>Security Along the Route: The Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, fearing that the welcoming crowd would disrupt order, stipulated the welcome methods a day in advance. The adjutant's office notified all agencies to investigate and comply. A security line was drawn, with the area from the Sanbei Company pier to the east of Wilson Road and west of Huangpi Road within the line. The entire 49th Regiment of the 9th Division strengthened the sentry posts along the Sanbei Company pier to Yang Sen's Garden. The 3rd Battalion of the 77th Regiment of the 13th Division was responsible for the area along the riverbank and around Yang Sen's Garden. The inspection team, military police regiment, and security team were equipped outside the security line. The temporary general and deputy commanders were separately appointed by the 3rd Army Corps and the Garrison Headquarters.</p>
<p>The Arrival: Upon receiving a telegram from the Wuhan Headquarters that Commander-in-Chief Chiang had departed, it immediately telegraphed the public security bureaus and telegraph offices of Jiujiang, Wuxue, Huangshigang, and Huangzhou to urgently report when the Yong Sui warship passed through so that they could be welcomed. At 7:00 PM on the 23rd, a telegram arrived from Jiujiang stating that it had passed Xunyang at 3:20 PM. At 10:00 PM that evening, another telegram arrived from Huangshigang stating that the Yong Sui had arrived at the port and dropped anchor. It was not until the 24th that telegrams arrived from Huangzhou along the way, reporting the itinerary. Thereupon, the welcoming crowds all went to the riverbank to wait. Military and political figures who arrived included He Yingqin, the chief of the headquarters; He Guoguang, the chief of staff; He Chengjun, the commander-in-chief of the 3rd Army Corps; Jiang Dingwen, the commander of the 2nd Army; Xia Douyin, the commander of the 13th Army; Yin Zusheng, the commander of the fortress; Wu Xingya, the director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government; Zhang Guanshi, the director of the Finance Department; Huang Changgu, the director of the Construction Department; Chen Zulie and Yang Zaichun, members of the Provincial Party Headquarters; Chen Xiping and Wang Yunpu, members of the Hankou Municipal Party Headquarters; and Liu Wendao, the mayor of Hankou. At 1:00 PM, the Yong Sui warship and the Jianguo ship arrived at the port. Military music played loudly, and cannons boomed. Commander-in-Chief Chiang disembarked amidst the cheers of the crowd.</p>
<p>Straight to the Headquarters: After disembarking, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, along with Chen Shaokuan, the Deputy Minister of the Navy, Shao Lizi, a member of the Central Committee, Cao Haosen, the Director of the Army Department, and He Yingqin, He Chengjun, and others, took cars directly to the headquarters (Yang Sen's Garden). He had a long discussion with He Yingqin and He Chengjun. It is reported that Chiang is scheduled to go to the Pinghan Railway with He Chengjun to inspect it and will return to Hankou in two or three days. The Wuhan welcome meeting will be held after Chiang returns to Hankou. (April 24)</p>

<h3>Qingdao Naval and Army Forces Suppress Jiaozhou Bandits</h3>
<p>Qingdao dispatch: A large group of bandits was recently discovered in the area of the Greater and Lesser Zhushan Mountains west of Jiaozhou Bay. The Qingdao Public Security Bureau dispatched police along with the Yongxiang warship of the navy to suppress them. The bandits fled upon hearing the news. When the military police departed and returned to Qingdao, they reappeared and harassed Xuejiadao and other places. The Qingdao authorities, believing that the bandits were so rampant that they could not pacify the maritime frontier without severely suppressing them, dispatched Fang Lianbi, the captain of the Security Brigade, with two security teams and two mortars from the municipal government on the 21st. The Northeast Navy dispatched two companies of naval infantry, as well as the Zhenhai and Yongxiang warships, and also dispatched two aircraft to fly to Jiaozhou Bay to scout and assist. At noon that day, the naval and army police arrived at Xuejiadao on the Feijing ship and camped at Lingshanwei that evening. Upon hearing the news, the bandits fled into the Panlong Temple in the Lesser Zhushan Mountains to observe the situation. The military police immediately tracked them forward and notified the Jiaoxian County government to dispatch a team to suppress them. At the same time, they contacted the local militia and ordered them to guide them forward. Yesterday, the Naval Headquarters received a telegram from the captain of the Yongxiang warship stating that the bandits intended to enter the sea from Chejialing and escape. It requested that the Haihe warship be sent to Huangdao to intercept them. The navy has now dispatched a warship to go there. (April 23)</p>
<h3>Recent News of Communist Bandits Wreaking Havoc in Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: The Communist bandits in northern Guangdong, after withdrawing from Nanxiong and Shixing, regrouped in southern Jiangxi and recaptured Xinfeng. The Guangdong army, based on reports that a force led by Zhu and Peng was still lingering in the Yu Ling Mountains, fearing that they would re-enter the Guangdong border from Yu Ling, has recently been conducting anti-bandit operations in northern Guangdong with unusual caution. At present, no fewer than 8,000 troops are gathered between Shaozhou and Shixing. The 3rd Battalion of Wu Wenxian's regiment, led by He Ding, is stationed in Mashi, Shixing. Chen Hanguang's regiment is stationed at the Hedong and Haba train stations opposite Shaoguan. Liang Gongfu's battalion of Zeng Youren's regiment is stationed in Shixing County. Two battalions are stationed in Zhou Tian, Renhua. The remaining teams, totaling about 7,000 people, are preparing to enter Nanxiong and join Zhang Huizan's division in Ganzhou to suppress the Xinfeng force. At the same time, troops are dispatched diagonally to the northeast to guard Longnan, preventing the Communist bandits from disturbing Lianping and Xingning in northeastern Guangdong after abandoning Xinfeng. The various armies in northern Guangdong are currently under the command of Wu Wenxian. At the same time, the provincial government has repeatedly received reports that the hidden Communist bandits in eastern Guangdong are planning to make trouble again, intending to collude with the Zhu and Peng force on the Jiangxi border to attack Lianping and Xingning. It has urgently telegraphed Dai Ji's 8th Brigade of the Eastern Guangdong Defense Army to quickly dispatch large detachments to defend Lianping, Heping, and Xinfeng and to coordinate with Wu Wenxian's troops in northern Guangdong to strictly prevent the Communist bandits from suddenly invading. At the same time, it ordered the county magistrates of various counties to quickly reorganize the militia to assist the military police in assuming responsibility for local security. As for the organization of the security team, it is currently urgently recruiting strong men. If the number of people in the four major teams cannot be fully recruited, two major teams will be established first. As for Guangxi, because the war is still undecided, both sides are stationed with heavy troops in Guiping and Guixian, and they are currently in a stalemate. Therefore, the military strength in the interior of Guangxi Province is extremely empty. Previously, Longzhou was raided by a large group of Communist bandits led by Yu Zuoyu and others. After Yu was severely suppressed by Yang Tenghui's troops of the Guangxi army, Yu began to flee east. According to a businessman who returned to Guangdong from Guangxi, the Communist bandits Yu Zuoyu and Wei Baqun once spied on Baise in the middle of this month but were repelled by Yang Tenghui's troops and fled back to the Fengshan Donglan area. After a brief stay, they learned that the defense forces of Liuzhou Qianjiang Binyang had all been transferred to Xun Gui for combat. Qingyuan and Liuzhou were empty. Yu and Wei then invaded Qing Liu from Donglan, inciting two or three thousand local bandits along the way, declaring that they would occupy Qing Liu as a base. Wherever they passed, houses were burned, and gentlemen and wealthy people were slaughtered. Recently, Yishan, Nandan, and Hechi counties have been devastated, and Liuzhou has been shaken. Li Zongren and Huang Shaoxiong were unable to return to suppress the rebellion because the team had set out to Dahe. They are still transferring Yang Tenghui's troops from Nanning via Qianjiang to Liuzhou to suppress them. (April 21)</p>

<h3>Liang Zhongjia's Coffin Arrives in Harbin</h3>

A large detachment of military police arrived, and many monks and Taoists also arrived. More than 60 monks from the Jile Temple automatically participated in chanting scriptures. At 10:05 AM, the hearse entered the station, with a combined passenger and freight car. When the door of the hearse opened, mourning music played loudly. Zhang Jinghui led all sectors to set up a memorial service on the platform and read the eulogy. At around 11:00 AM, the coffin was carried out of the station. The coffin was made of fir wood and covered with red silk. The outer coffin was purchased and donated by Wan Fulin, the chairman of the Black Province. After being placed on a dragon-head and phoenix-tail sedan chair, it was carried by sixty-four people. The ceremonial guard in front stretched for several miles, passing through the station street, turning into Lama Terrace, turning into Dazhi Street, and heading to Jile Temple. A large detachment of military police was assigned to escort the coffin, and many dignitaries also walked there. Along the streets, crowds stood to watch. Everyone took off their hats to pay their respects as the coffin passed. Zhang Xueliang sent Deputy Officer Chen as his representative to set up a shrine on Dazhi Street and greet the coffin. At 12:30 PM, the coffin arrived at Jile Temple and was placed in the mourning hall. The escorts lit incense, offered wine, paid their respects, and dispersed. From the 19th to the 21st, Zhang Jinghui funded the construction of a shed in the mourning hall to chant scriptures for three days and decided to lead his subordinates and all sectors of society in a public memorial service on the 20th. When the coffin was transported from Hailar, it was delayed for two days due to the people welcoming and mourning along the way before it arrived in Harbin. The citizens of Hailar organized a memorial meeting and divided it into propaganda, documents, and other departments to handle affairs. Many slogans were posted on the hearse, and declarations were issued at the stations along the way, describing Liang's integrity and achievements. Wang Erzhan, the chief of staff of the Hulunbuir Garrison Command, Liu Bin, the chief of staff of the 15th Brigade, and Zhao Zhongren, the director of the Hulunbuir Municipal Preparatory Office, accompanied the coffin. The Heilongjiang Provincial Government sent Dou Lianfang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and Kang Du, two councilors, to Harbin in advance to handle the transportation procedures. It is reported that Liang's coffin was originally intended to be buried in Hailun, Donghai, Heilongjiang, but is currently temporarily placed in the mourning hall of Jile Temple in Harbin.</p>
<h3>Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>The Case of Using Chinese and Russian Languages Concurrently for Telegraph Rights</p>
<p>The Russian Side Submits a Memorandum on Telegraph Rights</p>
<p>Director Hua Opposes the Establishment of a Translation Office</p>
<p>Harbin dispatch, 19th: Yesterday afternoon, the Chinese Eastern Railway Council convened a meeting. Chinese and Russian directors attended the meeting as scheduled. Seventeen ordinary proposals were completely passed. The telegraph rights item was discussed for a long time. The Russian side submitted a memorandum, the content of which roughly stated (before a new contract related to the Chinese Eastern Railway's telegraph rights is officially signed, the telegraph rights contract signed on November 22, 1922, shall be temporarily cited to handle all matters. The Chinese and Russian telegraph authorities must absolutely abide by this contract. After the new contract is established, the Chinese Eastern Railway telegraph office will not accept commercial telegrams and all private telegrams at all places along the Chinese Eastern Railway where there are Chinese telegraph bureaus. When the Chinese telegraph authority deems it necessary, long-distance telephones at all stations along the Chinese Eastern Railway can also be provided for private use. Telegrams sent from the Eastern Province to Russia or from Russia to the Eastern Province shall be sent and received in both Chinese and Russian languages. If the Chinese telegraph bureau needs to transfer lines through the Chinese Eastern Railway telegraph office, it can charge a handling fee according to the lowest value stipulated in the contract. Telegrams sent from the Eastern Province to Russia will still be charged at the current price, that is, 22 gold kopecks (copper coins) for each ordinary telegram sentence and 66 gold kopecks for urgent telegrams. The Chinese Eastern Railway authority shall implement the regulations in the contract regarding the receiving and dispatching of commercial telegrams. The exchange of telegraph handling fees shall be settled every three months). This is very different from the opinions of the Communications Committee and the eight compromise measures proposed by Mo Dehui. Therefore, the original proposal was retained and moved to next week's meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding the case of using Chinese and Russian languages concurrently in the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Council ordered the Road Bureau to organize a committee to review it, but it has not yet replied. On the 17th of this month, the Russian Bureau Director Rudyi suddenly issued a bureau order to establish a translation office, which is divided into four departments. The translation department formerly attached to the General Affairs Office was merged into it. All translation staff in various departments will also serve in the translation office. However, the bureau order only stated that all Chinese documents would be translated into Russian and did not mention the translation of Russian into Chinese. The Chinese department heads believed that if Chinese was translated into Russian, then the files of each department would be in Russian in the future, which would be very inconvenient for inspection. After the translations of each department were consolidated, the Chinese department heads, many of whom did not know Russian, would have even more difficulties when they obtained Russian documents. Yesterday, the Chinese department heads jointly met with Mo Dehui, the director-general, to express their opinions and oppose this method. The Legal Department of the Road Bureau even sent an official letter to the General Affairs Office, stating the advantages and disadvantages of the matter. The original letter is as follows (replying directly: I have received your letter and respectfully learned that our department's opinion on the establishment of the translation office is as follows: (1) The interpretation of using Chinese and Russian languages concurrently refers to having the same effect. For example, when two countries conclude a treaty and prepare the original in foreign language and Chinese, this is the meaning of concurrent use. The fundamental problem lies in the official document format. If there is a Russian document, a Chinese document must be attached in conjunction, so that it can be called concurrent use. It does not matter whether the translation office exists or not, and it is not a problem. Our department believes that the problem of concurrent use should have another abstract solution. Each department head should provide a written opinion for public discussion in preparation. The dispute cannot be resolved by the existence or non-existence of the translation office. (2) The Chinese Eastern Railway is a joint venture between two countries, and equal employment is an immutable principle. There are many benefits to the concurrent use of languages. For example, when writing to the court, Russian alone cannot be used, and Chinese and Russian must be used concurrently. This can prove that the concurrent use of Chinese and Russian is beneficial to the people. It is not a proper way to use Russian exclusively in the department's official documents. Changing to the concurrent use of Chinese and Russian will benefit both Chinese and foreigners. If the thorough reform is not carried out, the goal of friendship between the two countries will be difficult to achieve. Moreover, each department has its own habits. If Chinese and Russian are used concurrently, it should be discussed in detail with each department. Setting up a translation office will inevitably be arbitrary and all-inclusive, which will not only be useless but will also hinder the process of using Chinese and Russian languages concurrently. Moreover, the Road Bureau has an old translation office and a Chinese-Russian secretariat. If another translation office is set up, there will be organizational conflicts and the suspicion of adding redundant agencies. Tracing back to the meaning of the Council's advocacy of the concurrent use of Chinese and Russian languages, it lies in the concurrent use of spirit and form. For example, the use of Chinese and Russian languages in both internal and external affairs, regardless of the territory, is the form of concurrent use. Being able to combine this form and use public documents consistently in each department is the spirit of concurrent use. The so-called equal effect of languages is nothing more than this. If you plan to set up redundant agencies to manipulate, it is a policy of non-sincere concurrent use of Chinese and Russian languages. Based on the opinions on the right, please advocate the cancellation of the organization of the translation office to avoid affecting the process of using Chinese and Russian documents.) The Council will also discuss this matter at a meeting next week.</p>

<p>Rice Merchant Encountered Bandits but Escaped Robbery: Zhang Chunxiang, a rice merchant from Pudong, has been buying and selling grain at various rice shops in Anting Huangdu for a long time.

<p>Financial Bureau Rectifies Tax Deeds: She Yingduo, the director of the County Finance Bureau, previously visited Songjiang with an inspector from the Finance Department.

Now, Director She has formulated various reporting forms and sent them to the district offices for distribution to townships and police stations for compliance. The rectification measures are as follows: (1) When people pawn or sell real estate, the land guard must be present to certify the deed. Therefore, the land guard is most aware of field and house transactions. Now, the bureau has formulated a reporting form and distributed it to the land guards, instructing them to fill in the transaction information of real estate within the map at any time and report it to the bureau at the end of the month for tax collection. If there is any concealment or collusion in underreporting the property value, a fine equal to that of the property owner will be imposed, and serious offenders will be investigated. (2) An order is issued to all compilers that they must rely on the push-and-collect certificate for transfer. A reporting form is formulated and distributed to each compiler, who must fill in each item during the transfer and compare it with the previous register when submitting the busy canal actual collection register. If there is any change in between that has not been included, it is considered concealment by the compiler, who shall be fined the same amount as the property owner. At the same time, an order is given to investigate the area under their jurisdiction at any time. If there is any private deed filling or underreporting of property value, they may report it to the bureau for punishment, and half of the fine will be awarded as a reward. (3) Substitute tax deed collection offices are set up in the four branch offices of Tinglin, Fengjing, Tianmashan, and Qibao. The deed tax silver will be turned over to the bureau once every five days. After the bureau fills in the deed, it will be returned to the respective branch offices for redistribution to the property owners for collection. At the same time, one-third of the handling fee charged by the branch office will be provided as a subsidy to the branch office.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Civil Affairs and Construction Implements Austerity Policies: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs used to have six sections internally, with two additional secretarial and police departments. The total annual expenditure was about 345,000 yuan, or 34,000 yuan per month. The new budget is about 445,000 yuan per year, or 37,000 yuan per month. Now, due to the exhaustion of the provincial treasury, Minister Hu has implemented austerity policies, and very few personnel have been announced for various sections. It is planned to carefully identify and determine who will leave and stay. In addition, with the establishment of the Provincial Security Office, it is planned to transfer the original Third Section in charge of public security and the Fourth Section in charge of water police to the office to save expenses. In addition, the Construction Department originally had five sections in charge of construction, water conservancy, industry and commerce, finance, accounting, and general affairs. Now, Minister Sun believes that the department's expenses have been resolved by the provincial government meeting, reducing 1,000 yuan per month, so the internal contraction should be carried out to balance revenue and expenditure. Therefore, it is planned to merge the original five sections into four sections, that is, the Third Section in charge of industry and commerce will be merged into the Second Section, which will be implemented soon.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Asks to Exempt Tax on the Transportation of Foreign Rice: The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce stated that the province of Jiangsu suffered a famine last year, especially in northern Jiangsu. At this time when the green and yellow are not connected, there is no source, and rice prices are gradually rising. The counties have to raise funds and purchase foreign rice from outside ports to help the people. However, there are still several months before the autumn harvest, and it is necessary to purchase and handle them continuously to be able to provide continuous assistance. The price of rice is high, and the people's livelihood is difficult. It is not enough to maintain the people's food without facilitating transportation and reducing the burden. In view of the difficulties of the people, and in order to appeal on their behalf, the Ministry of Finance was telegraphed yesterday, hoping that the disaster-stricken areas of Jiangsu Province would be considered wide, and the people's food would be difficult. When this foreign rice passes through various customs stations, it will be temporarily exempted from tax for three months, and all customs stations will be notified to comply with it to benefit the disaster victims.</p>

<p>Supervisor Arrests Kidnapping Bandits and Hostages: Li Zheng, the Supervisor of the Public Security Bureau, led the police to Niuzhuang, Ganquan Mountain the day before yesterday and arrested the female Xiao Ganzi, who was kidnapped, and two bandits, Zhou Fusheng and Bao Lianke. Yesterday (the 23rd), they were escorted to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>The Case of False Accusation of the Director Has Been Clarified: The Transportation Department ordered Zeng Chong, the former company commander of the Huainan Anti-Smuggling Camp, to accuse Tang Ken, the Director of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau. The department secretly investigated and dispatched Hu Xianrui, the second section chief of the department, to investigate and reply to each allegation. It has now been clarified that Lü Rong was suspected of colluding with bandits and left his post on his own. Later, he sought a career with Tang but failed. This time's accusation is purely fabricated. Yesterday (the 23rd), Hu truthfully presented the case to the department through the company.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Party Affairs Inspector Arrives in He: Yang Yun, the Party Affairs Inspector of the Jiaxing region, arrived in He yesterday from Hang. He immediately went to the County Party Headquarters for inspection and then went to the district party headquarters and district branches for inspection. It is reported that Yang will go to Pinghu for inspection after completing the inspection in He.</p>
<p>Telegraph to Request Protection of the Cocoon Factory: The sericulture affairs in Jiaxing's four townships are about to be completed in a blink of an eye. Each cocoon factory is raising funds and taking posts in order to collect cocoons at the time. However, due to the influx of local bandits in recent times, robberies are frequent, and cocoon merchants dare not raise funds to collect cocoons, resulting in the contracts signed with the factory owners being cancelled one after another. The original cocoon trade has not even been renewed by two-tenths. Now, the Six County Cocoon Industry Association of Jiasu telegraphed the province yesterday, requesting maintenance measures.</p>
<p>Selling the Old Xie Office Building is Not Allowed: The old Xie Office in Jiaxing City is currently occupied by the Second District Department of the Water Police. Recently, District Chief Zhao Tingyu moved the district department to the Lanxi Guild Hall in Dongmen and sold the old Xie Office building to raise funds for the relocation. The district department sent a letter to the county to report to the province for approval. It is now learned that after the Civil Finance and Construction Department received the report, the old Xie Office was originally borrowed by the Water Police District Department and was not allocated for use. This building must be reserved for future public use. The requested sale is difficult to approve.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Alarm of Lake Bandits in Dongwang Village: At noon on the 24th, a large gang of lake bandits (rumored to be a merger of Taibao Ashu, who was defeated and retreated, and a small gang), 97 boats, were moored in the Dongwang Village area of ​​Zhao Xiong, three miles away from Dingzha, on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Rumors spread that they were planning to rob a certain large town nearby. After receiving the report, the local authorities immediately telegraphed District Chief Zhao of Jiaxing, who personally led the Yiwu and Gonghe warships and twenty teacher ships to encircle and suppress them from the south. The seventh team was ordered to take the north road, and Taozhuang, Luxu, and Jinze were to be encircled and suppressed. The eighth team's patrol team took the middle road, and the Zhiguo warship Shangwu Ningxing two rounds towed more than 30 teacher ships from Xitang out of Xiangfu Dang to attack Dingzha head-on. At dusk, there were gunshots, which seemed to be contact between the two sides, but the details are unknown.</p>
<p>Refugees Harass the Area: More than two hundred refugees from Xiangtan are now in the southeastern countryside of Xitang in this county, forcibly robbing and extorting, even kidnapping people for ransom and forcing extortion. The villagers in more than twenty villages nearby dare not live at home and fled to the city to take temporary shelter. On the afternoon of the 24th, they advanced towards Xitang and rested in the Dongyue Temple, a few miles away from the town. It is said that many of the refugees have firearms. The townspeople are panicked, and the competent authorities dare not suppress them. It is rumored that this group of refugees is under the eyes of bandits, so they have such a momentum.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>The Appeal Case Has Been Adjudicated: Zhao Xinwen (ie Zhao Jiakui) outside the East Gate of this city was arrested in January of this year for a tobacco case. The county government sentenced him to two months in prison and fined him 300 yuan. Zhao refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Hangzhou Higher Court. It is now learned that the High Court revoked the original verdict regarding the sentencing part and changed the sentence to two months in prison and a fine of 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Sends Team to Zhuji to Suppress Bandits: According to a long-distance telephone report from County Magistrates Xu of Zhuji and Qi, more than 2,000 agricultural troops were in contact with bandits, looting Sandu Town, and the bandits in the southeast rose up in response. The Provincial Government specially dispatched Battalion Commander Chen Zhifan of the Sixth Regiment to lead a team to suppress and defend yesterday.</p>
<p>After the Robbery, Ninety Percent of Sian is Empty: Sian, in the province of Zhejiang and Huzhou, has been harassed by bandits from Anhui for more than twenty hours. Although the reinforcements arrived quickly, the loss was not great, but the residents were already frightened birds, and they moved to other places, resulting in ninety percent of the houses being empty and desolate. Yesterday, someone from Changxing talked about the fact that the business market in Sian had no one cent of transaction all day long.</p>
<p>Two Ministries Meeting to Rescue Silk: The Provincial Government of Zhejiang Province, based on the joint request from twelve factories including Tain Zhang of Hang Silk Industry Association for the award of specially improved weaving industry, approved the exemption of tax for ten years, which is related to the province's income. Yesterday, it ordered the Ministries of Finance and Construction to jointly review and report the seizure.</p>
<p>New and Old Police Chiefs of Hang City: Li Zizai, the police chief of Hang, was dismissed and investigated for the case. He has now been transferred to the court for questioning for three hours. The content is complicated, and many people are involved. It is necessary to continue to study and question. The points of unauthorized fines and encroachment on legal rights have been confirmed. Yan Youfu, the new police chief, took office yesterday after being commissioned and will take an oath on a scheduled date after asking the Ministry of Civil Affairs.</p>
<h3>Zhuji</h3>
<p>The Entire Town of Sandu Was Robbed: After the giant bandit Wu Guifa was wiped out in Zhuji, Zhejiang, the territory was relatively peaceful in recent years. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 22nd of this month, a large number of bandits suddenly appeared in Sandu, the county, with an estimated total of more than 3,000 people. They moved in groups, raged to the town, first robbed the police station of firearms, and then looted all the stores, leaving the town empty. County Magistrate Xu of the county heard the alarm and immediately telegraphed the Department of Civil Affairs to dispatch troops to encircle and suppress them on the 23rd. It is reported that the Department of Civil Affairs has consulted the Security Department to quickly prevent and suppress them.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>The Shaoshan Automobile Accident Caused Damage: At 8 am on the 24th, the Shaoshan Provincial Highway automobile overturned into the mud when it was heading from Jiangqian to Xiaoshan and passing the Xixing Station because the driver was careless. At that time, an old woman surnamed Mo in the urban area was crushed to death, and six passengers were seriously injured. The rescue vehicle immediately sent all the injured to Xiaocheng Jimin Hospital for treatment. It is not known whether the two seriously injured can avoid the sorrow of life.</p>
<p>The Money Industry Agreed on Long-Term Interest Rates: In addition to the current flow, the money industry in Shaoshan has a long-term item, with a term of six months. It is released at the end of every March and September. After the implementation of the national calendar, it was changed to the end of April. Now that the release period for this long-term item has arrived, all interest rates have been agreed. Fellow trades pay 9 yuan and 25 cents per thousand per month, totaling 55 yuan and 50 cents. Foreign trades pay 9 yuan and 50 cents per thousand per month, totaling 57 yuan.</p>
<p>The Difficulty of Collecting Autonomous Donations: The Xiaoshan County Government previously ordered each village association to collect autonomous donations and set the donation rate for cultivated land and business rent interest income into four grades of A, B, C, and D, and collect them from each household. However, the countryside has been hit by disasters for years, and in handling land declarations, all business households with a little property have been ransacked. Now that we are collecting autonomous donations again, most households are embarrassed. Also, the village chiefs are not well-behaved, and they specialize in extortion, which is especially undesirable by the local people. Therefore, it is quite difficult to handle this donation.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>It is Not Allowed to Collect Additional Donations Under the Cocoon Donation Item: The Finance Bureau received a provincial order yesterday, stating that it is not allowed to collect local additional donations under the cocoon donation item without authorization from the county. Now that the cocoon collection period is approaching, the bureau has notified all agencies to comply with it.</p>
<p>Send Personnel to Investigate the Disaster Situation in Xixiang: Due to the severe disaster situation in Xixiang, Xialv Bridge, and other places, He Keyuan was sent by County Magistrate Tang yesterday to investigate and find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>The Deadline for Borrowing Construction Public Bonds to Be Submitted: Shaoxing has recognized a loan of 400,000 yuan for construction public bonds. Except for the first phase of 100,000 yuan in March, which has already been submitted, the second phase in April is approaching. County Magistrate Tang has set a deadline for the 27th to pay the full amount.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Hubei and Jinan</h3>
<p>Resolution of Scout Conflict</p>
<p>The Hubei team has returned to Hubei. The Jinan University President gave a lecture and dealt with the scouts involved.</p>
<p>Details of the Conflict</p>
<p>Although this National Boy Scout General Inspection encountered various inconveniences due to weather and location, the organizing office made every effort to ensure the participating Boy Scouts endured hardship and persevered. From the inspection on the 18th to the opening and closing ceremonies on the 22nd, everything proceeded smoothly. The objectives of the general inspection, grand encampment, and performances were fully achieved and were quite impressive. After the closing ceremony, at 6 PM on the 22nd, as the scout troops were preparing to return to their respective places, unfortunately, a misunderstanding arose between the Jinan Scouts and the Hubei Scouts, initially due to language barriers, leading to verbal disputes and a conflict. This caused aftershocks from the closing ceremony. Various newspapers in Nanjing have already reported on this matter, but the accounts were inaccurate and contained errors. An important official from the organizing office discussed the actual events, which are recorded as follows: The Jinan Scouts had attempted to steal from the camp. On the evening of the 22nd, the Hubei Scouts were packing, preparing to leave the camp that night by boat to the west. They sent someone to the Jinan Scout troop to retrieve leather shoes and other items. The person sent had a Hubei accent. Most of the Jinan Scouts were children of overseas Chinese. Due to the language barrier, a misunderstanding arose, leading to a dispute. Initially, it was only a verbal argument, but then more and more scouts from both sides gathered, deepening the misunderstanding, which led to physical fighting. At that time, an important official from the organizing office was away on other important business, and the officials present tried to dissuade them, but due to the large and noisy crowd, they were unable to resolve the misunderstanding. Several of the younger Hubei Scouts fell in the mud or were hit by fists, feet, or sticks and were injured. During the chaos, someone from the Jinan side brought a shotgun used for camping and fired two shots into the air to intimidate, further disrupting order. Fortunately, the important official from the organizing office heard the news and rushed back, immediately stopping the situation and ordering all the scouts to return to their tents to restore order. By then, it was already dark, and all the boys and girls were terrified by the disturbance. The organizing office then requested the officers of the army unit stationed there to be on alert and sent personnel to explain the situation to each troop, so everyone could sleep peacefully. The injured were immediately given appropriate medical treatment by the hygiene department, and the Jinan Scout troop leader, a Mr. Chen, and a student团 who unauthorized fired the shotgun were detained to be disciplined by the Scout Headquarters according to Scout regulations. The remaining Jinan Scouts returned to Shanghai that night. The Hubei Scouts, due to the injured requiring medical treatment, delayed their departure from Nanjing. It is reported that the injured have been examined by the hygiene department, and none have life-threatening injuries. They have been sent to the Central Treatment Room and the Central Hospital for quiet recuperation. Therefore, the majority of the Hubei Scouts departed for Xiaguan today (the 24th) to await a boat back to Hubei. It is also reported that after the incident that night, Jinan University President Zheng Hongnian rushed to the organizing office upon hearing the news and severely reprimanded the leader of the school's scout troop. He also went to the Hubei Scout camp to express his sympathy to the Hubei Scouts. Everyone was very calm, and all misunderstandings had been cleared up. It is also reported that the Scout Headquarters has decided on appropriate punishments for the troop leader who caused the trouble and the member who fired the gun. The members of the troops involved in the incident were all young students in the lower grades of Jinan University.</p>
<h3>(1) President Zheng Hongnian's Address</h3>
<p>Yesterday (April 25th) at 9:00 AM, Jinan University in this city held a meeting in the school auditorium to commend the athletes who participated in the National Games in Hangzhou and to address the scouts who participated in the General Inspection in Nanjing. First, President Zheng Hongnian of the school delivered a speech and address, stating: "This time, our students went to Hangzhou to participate in the National Games. This can be said to be the first time since the establishment of the National Government. The Shanghai team performed excellently this time, and our school is also part of the Shanghai team. I am extremely pleased with this achievement, so I am holding this meeting to commend and reward you. Our school has had a very good reputation in sports for the past three years and is recognized nationwide. In previous years, there was always an incident at the event. Once, our school students went to Hangzhou to arrange accommodation in advance. That day happened to be the wedding of Mr. Cai Yuanpei's son. I went to congratulate him and asked Mr. Cai to write a letter to Mr. Jiang Menglin to take care of our students. Two friends who were present frowned and said, 'Your school students often hit people. It's a bit scary.' I said that wouldn't happen. I guaranteed it. Another time, students from Central University behaved disrespectfully towards our students. Our students were able to endure it. They ran to my house that night. I was very pleased with their forbearance. However, I was a little dissatisfied because some things were published in the newspapers afterward. I don't think this kind of behavior is right. We should advocate the education of gentlemen, which means to forgive and not to bear grudges. Winning is certainly a virtue of progress, but there should be proper respect between groups. In the past three years, our school students have not only had a good position in sports but also made great progress in self-cultivation. I am always very pleased with this. This commendation meeting should have been held last week, but because I had to</p>
<h3>A Review of the Second National Education Conference (2)</h3>
<p>II. Preliminary Plan for Implementing Compulsory Education</p>
<p>(I) General Principles</p>
<p>(A) Objectives</p>
<p>(1) To ensure that all 40 million school-age children across the country who are not in school receive four years of compulsory education.</p>
<p>(2) For children who cannot continue in school for four years, to flexibly adjust the schooling period through supplementary education or self-study systems to make up for the compulsory education they should receive.</p>
<p>(B) Timeframe</p>
<p>(1) Within five years, complete the establishment of national teacher training institutions and simultaneously open 1,500 pilot areas for compulsory education in cities and rural areas.</p>
<p>(2) Gradually expand thereafter, and within 20 years, implement four years of compulsory education nationwide.</p>
<h3>(II) Cultivating Teachers and Methods for Phased Enrollment of Children</h3>
<p>(1) Approximately 200,000 teachers are needed for urban primary schools. Existing secondary teacher training institutions in cities are responsible for training them. Approximately 1.2 million teachers are needed for rural primary schools. Each county nationwide should establish 1,500 rural normal schools within five years, responsible for training them, with an average of 800 graduates per school. From the sixth year onwards, each school should have an average of 53 graduates per year.</p>
<p>(2) Teachers for urban normal schools are to be trained by existing normal universities or education colleges of various universities.</p>
<p>(3) A total of 21,000 teachers are needed for county-level rural normal schools nationwide. The provinces are to establish 27 rural normal colleges and normal departments of normal colleges, responsible for training them. From the second year to the fourth year, each province and each institution must train 180 teachers.</p>
<p>(4) 540 teachers are needed for provincial rural normal colleges and specialized departments. The National Compulsory Education College is responsible for training them in two years, cultivating 270 people each year. Thereafter, continue to train 200 people each year to fill vacancies.</p>
<p>(5) The National Compulsory Education College and pilot areas should establish two pilot areas in the first year, one in a city and one in a rural area, for student experimentation and to serve as a foundation for promoting compulsory education nationwide.</p>
<p>(6) Provincial normal colleges, specialized departments, and provincial compulsory education pilot areas should also be established in the second year, with urban and rural pilot areas also.</p>
<p>(7) County normal schools should be established in three phases, one-third in the third year, the fourth year, and the fifth year, respectively. From the third year to the fifth year, 500 county normal schools should be added each year nationwide, along with 500 urban and rural pilot areas.</p>
<p>(8) From the sixth year onwards, a net increase of 75,500 teachers per year can increase 75,000 primary schools, educating 3 million children. By the 18th year, primary schools will be universally established nationwide, and compulsory education will be fully implemented in the 20th year.</p>
<p>(9) In addition to teacher training, the following matters should also be handled:</p>
<p>(A) Register all normal school graduates in the province.</p>
<p>(B) Strictly enforce the service regulations for normal school graduates, requiring them to serve for two to five years.</p>
<p>(C) Assess primary school teachers who are not formal normal school graduates.</p>
<p>(D) Train unqualified teachers for one or two years.</p>
<p>(E) Examine teachers in private schools. Those who pass are allowed to be primary school teachers; those who fail are required to attend county normal school for two years of supplementary study.</p>
<p>(III) Methods for Increasing Classrooms</p>
<p>(1) Utilize ancestral temples nationwide.</p>
<p>(2) Utilize academies and public venues.</p>
<p>(3) Utilize all temples and monasteries.</p>
<p>(4) Reward private individuals for donating houses or funds to build school buildings.</p>
<p>(5) Publicly construct school buildings that are economical and durable.</p>
<p>attend the National Education Conference in Nanjing and could not return, so I specifically changed it to this week to personally commend you. On the day of the General Inspection in Nanjing, I walked through the entire venue, carefully comparing the scout troops from various places. I saw that our school's scout troop was very well-organized, spirited, and disciplined. Their actions were also very agile and lively, so I was very happy. After returning, I wrote a letter back to the school, wanting to commend all the scouts who participated in the General Inspection in Nanjing together. That night, someone invited me to dinner. I didn't know about the incident until later. When I returned home, several students were waiting for me and reported the situation. I immediately ran to the organizing office and to the Hubei troop. The students were very polite and gentle when they saw me arrive. I asked them about the reason for the conflict and said I was very sorry that their students were injured. The next morning, I ran to the Hubei troop again to express my sympathy. There were several minor injuries and three serious injuries, which would probably heal completely in ten days or eight days. Later, because some students from our school went to Zhenjiang to visit the Department of Education, someone said they were plainclothes members of our school going to retaliate, so they had a misunderstanding and detained Troop Leader Chen and Scout Zhou Yancan. After I explained to them, they were released. Now the Hubei troop has returned by ship from Xiaguan. Troop Leader Chen and Zhou Yancan can also be released and returned today. This incident with the scouts is very dishonorable no matter what, so today I am canceling the commendation for the scouts who participated in the General Inspection in Nanjing and will ask for a list of those who were violent that day. The lightest punishment will be a major demerit to serve as a warning in the future, especially for the junior high school students. You must pay special attention to cultivate a peaceful and loving attitude. Scouts should focus on cultivating the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage. Knowing shame is courage. Cultivation is required to have courage. An ordinary person cannot have his will taken away, which is also courage. I hope that all students will work harder in the future to make up for this shortcoming." Next, the scout representative of the school responded, stating: "The occurrence of this incident was actually because our school's scouts were practicing stealing camps from the Hubei troop and stole the Hubei troop's flag. The Hubei scouts did not understand these rules and said that our school's scouts were stealing and, in front of Mr. Dai Jitao, a member of the Central Committee, called our school's scouts bandits. Our school's students were humiliated by this dishonorable accusation, and Mr. Dai did not investigate clearly, which was quite infuriating. We were about to explain to Mr. Dai when the Hubei troop had a misunderstanding and surrounded our school's scouts with more than 200 people. Our school's scouts only had 40 people, so we had to fight back bravely. However, we are deeply ashamed and remorseful for this incident and are willing to accept the strictest punishment." It is heard that the school authorities have severely punished the scouts who caused the trouble to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>The Jinan Scouts Have Been Dealt With Separately</h3>

<h3>The Library Undertakings of Liaoning Province</h3>
<p>A Conversation with Mr. Bian Zongmeng, Director of the Provincial Library</p>
<p>Recently, the Liaoning Education Delegation went south to visit the educational achievements of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In addition to the principals of various primary and secondary schools, Mr. Bian Zongmeng, the director of the Liaoning Provincial Library, also accompanied the delegation. The reporter spoke to him yesterday and inquired about the library undertakings in the Northeast. Mr. Bian's remarks were quite detailed and are summarized below:</p>
<p>In recent years, education in Liaoning has made considerable progress, and no effort has been spared to expand and develop social education. Taking libraries as an example, although there is only one provincial library (as Bian referred to his own), efforts have been made to increase funding in the 18th annual budget last year to strengthen it. I also arrived at the library at that time and greatly improved the library's operations, such as reorganizing old collections, increasing the purchase of new books, and adding children's reading rooms and popular lectures. Over the past few months, the results have been visible. The current collection includes more than 35,000 types of books, totaling over 102,000 volumes. Chinese books account for about two-thirds of the collection, with both old and new Chinese books in equal measure. Important old books, such as the Complete Collection of Illustrations and Books, are mostly available. The average daily number of readers reaches over 80, mostly students. In addition to our library, most counties have county libraries, currently totaling over 40. Although many are being reorganized, they are all expected to develop in the future. The provincial and county libraries are jointly organizing a library association, which is currently being planned and is expected to be realized this year. As for school libraries, all primary and secondary schools have libraries. However, the Northeast University has the most books. The university's new library building is under construction and is quite large in scale. The university's books were previously stored separately in various departments and were not managed systematically. In the future, when the new building is completed, there will definitely be a new reorganization. The old collection of the Siku Quanshu in the Wen Yuan Pavilion in the provincial capital has been completely copied and supplemented, but it is still stored and not open to the public. In the future, it may be organized and made public. In addition, what is most noteworthy is that the Japanese have established many libraries in the Northeast and pay great attention to collecting literature about the Northeast (adding a so-called "Manchuria-Mongolia" category in addition to the usual ten categories). Most of the libraries are located along the South Manchurian Railway, totaling 37. There are seven libraries in Dalian alone, and two in Shenyang. In addition, all major stations have them. Those without libraries have mobile libraries to ensure that all places with Japanese residents have libraries for their convenience. Looking back at our country, we are truly ashamed. Last year, I visited many of the libraries established by the Japanese and drafted a report to inform our countrymen, hoping that they would pay close attention to it. I have visited 16 libraries in Jiangsu and Zhejiang on this trip, each with its own strengths and merits. I will make many suggestions for the improvement of our provincial library after returning, which should not be in vain, he said.</p>

<h3>China Public School Opens Sports Meet Today</h3>
<p>Wusong China Public School has been vigorously promoting sports recently. It is heard that they are scheduled to hold a spring sports meet in the afternoons of the 26th and 27th of this month.</p>
<h3>Day One Record</h3>
<p>Jinan University Sports Meet</p>
<p>Undiminished by Rain</p>
<p>And Able to Set New Records</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the National Jinan University Spring Sports Meet. Although the weather was uncooperative, with wind and rain, the spirit was undiminished, and indeed felt even more courageous. It is truly because the athletes of this school possess outstanding talent, learning from each other to promote progress, and encouraging each other through competition. This time, the number of male and female students participating in sports exceeded one hundred, surpassing the number of previous sessions. The school suspended classes for two days. The law department, located in Shanghai, also returned to Zhenru yesterday to participate. Furthermore, local men and women, long admiring the reputation of Jinan University's sports meet, flocked to watch, with many carrying cameras to take photographs, an endless stream. The parking lot in front of the school was almost completely full. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Overview of the Venue</p>
<p>The venue is in the school's newly opened sports area. Although the Tai Chi room and gymnasium within the area have not yet been completed, the grounds have been leveled and arranged in an orderly manner. Located in the eastern part of the school, Zhiyuan Hall stands majestically in the northwest. The southeast borders the suburbs, with lush trees and beautiful scenery. The surroundings of the field are covered in green grass, adding to the natural beauty. The command platform is located in the north of the center of the field, using the soccer goalposts, with party and national flags hanging from the corners, fluttering in the wind, their colors appearing even fresher and more vibrant due to the rain. A portrait of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen hangs in the middle, with a stage about half a丈 high set below. To the west of the field, the trees are used as a barrier, with bamboo separating the spectators' standing area. Further west, in an open space, three or four Boy Scout tents are set up for the athletes to rest.</p>
<p>Competition Results</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the rain, the field was slippery because it was a newly developed area and the soil had not yet solidified. However, new records were still set in the Group A 100-meter race and high jump. If the weather had been clear, the results would have been even more amazing.</p>

<h3>Umeya Shokichi Continues to Make</h3>
<p>Sun Yat-sen Statue to be Shipped to China</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai on May 2nd</p>
<p>A letter from Japanese citizen Umeya Shokichi to this newspaper states: "To the esteemed editor, I am writing to inform you that I previously donated two bronze statues of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which were erected in the capitals of China and Japan. I am deeply grateful for the warm welcome they received. To further my aspirations, I have commissioned the creation of five additional bronze statues of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in my country. These statues will be erected in important cities throughout your nation, including Beijing, Wuchang, Guangdong, and Zhongshan County, as a testament to my admiration. The statue intended for Guangdong (Whampoa Military Academy) has already been completed and will be transported to Shanghai on the Japanese ship Taiyo Maru at the end of April (arriving on May 2nd). From there, the military academy will dispatch a warship to escort it to Guangzhou. In addition to sending letters to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government and the Guangdong authorities, I have also consulted with Mayor Zhang Qun. I will dispatch representatives to Shanghai to welcome the statue upon its arrival. This special letter is sent to inform you and request that you publish it in your newspaper for public awareness. Sincerely, Umeya Shokichi, April 24th, Republic of China Year 19."</p>
<h3>Special Alert in the Concession</h3>
<p>Due to the recent occurrence of major cases in the concession area, the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) of the International Settlement, in order to maintain public safety, in addition to constantly supervising Chinese and Western detectives patrolling the streets in plain clothes, announced a special alert starting at 5:00 AM this morning. An official order was also issued, notifying all twelve police stations in the International Settlement that all Chinese police officers are to remain stationed at their police stations, awaiting dispatch at any time, in order to mobilize when necessary.</p>
<h3>Public Tram Strike in the International Settlement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tram Workers Present Nine Demands</p>
<p>Less than a week after the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) bus strike, drivers and ticket sellers of the British and American tram company also went on strike yesterday afternoon, causing all trams and trolleybuses running on various roads to come to a complete halt. According to the company, they did not receive any warning from the workers before the strike. However, according to worker sources, the demands had been submitted to the company two days prior but received no response, hence the strike was implemented yesterday. It is said that the reason for the strike is that after the tram fares were increased starting last Sunday, the daily revenue increased dramatically, reaching 1,400 yuan. The tram workers, feeling the pressure of rising prices and the cost of living, initiated a wage increase movement. Another reason is said to be that after the bus company workers went on strike, the company failed to accommodate the workers' demands and instead hired Russians to drive and sell tickets. The tram workers, feeling that this concerned the same public utility, went on strike in support. These rumors are compiled and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Strike Process: Signs of a tram worker strike were already apparent the day before yesterday. On that day, the tram workers made a request to the company for an increase of seven cents per day for rice allowance. The company reportedly agreed at the time, and thus the day passed peacefully. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, the time when the trams usually start running, about 700 drivers and ticket sellers at the old depot in Tilanqiao failed to report for duty. It was then that it became known that some tram workers had begun a strike. As a result, eastern district trams, such as Routes 6, 7, 8, and 9 trams, and Routes 17 and 18 trolleybuses, were immediately suspended starting early yesterday morning. By yesterday afternoon, the strike had spread to the new depot in Hart Road in the western district. Tram workers on Routes 1 and 2 drove their trams back to the depot and began striking. By 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the entire Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) tram service had completely shut down.</p>
<p>Scope of the Strike: Trams and buses in the French Concession, except for those running on Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) routes, were slightly affected. Otherwise, they continued to run as usual. Route 5 trams, operated by the French company, which run between the North Railway Station and the Ximen area, and Routes 17 and 18 trolleybuses, which must pass through the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), shortened their routes to run only between the borders of the French and International Settlements, not entering the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) area. Trams and buses in Nanshi and buses in Zhabei continued to run as usual.</p>
<p>Strike Conditions: The tram workers presented the following nine demands for the strike: (1) A uniform wage increase of eight yuan per month for each person. (2) A uniform rice allowance of three yuan per month for each person. (3) Recognition of the club's right to represent all workers, with the management subsidizing office expenses of 300 yuan per month. (4) Wages to be paid as usual during weekly holidays and festival holidays, with double pay for those who work. (5) Wages to be paid as usual for sick leave. (6) Wages to be paid as usual during the strike. (7) No workers to be dismissed and oppose the hiring of White Russians. (8) Release of arrested workers and no further arrests of workers. (9) Tea containers to be set up at all timekeeping stations.</p>
<p>Strike Discipline: (1) Absolutely obey the orders of the strike committee. (2) Actively participate in strike work. (3) Anyone who engages in the following disruptive behavior will be treated as a traitorous worker and rigorously dealt with: 1. Those who return to work privately without receiving a resumption of work order from the strike committee. 2. Those who engage in various propaganda to sabotage the strike. 3. Those who collude with capitalists and organs of worker oppression and inform the enemy. Shanghai International Settlement Tram Company Strike Committee, April 25th.</p>
<p>Company Attitude: According to the Ta Wan Pao, after the tram strike, reporters visited the company's general manager, Mr. Boggis. Mr. Boggis stated that the sudden strike was unexpected. When the company learned that trams in the Tilanqiao area had stopped running that morning, everyone in the company was surprised. Although there are various indications that could serve as reasons for the strike, the workers have not yet made any indication. The factory has not received any formal request for a salary increase. He believes that the matter is not for a salary increase. Mr. Boggis is currently waiting for the workers to formally notify him of the motives for the strike.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Refutes</h3>
<p>Macdonald's Fallacies</p>
<p>Chinese Support of Macdonald Registered Significantly, Creating His Position</p>
<p>Macdonald's Speech Presents Obsolete Ideas, Undermining Sino-Foreign Cooperation</p>
<p>Violating British Government's China Policy</p>
<p>Rendering British Government Declarations Worthless</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association issued a Sino-English rebuttal yesterday to Mr. Macdonald's speech on the 16th of this month at the Ratepayers' Westerner Meeting. The Chinese version is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors by two this year was discussed at the Foreign Ratepayers' Meeting on April 16th of this year. Mr. Macdonald (a lawyer at the Godefroy law firm) gave a lengthy speech that incited the foreign ratepayers in attendance with his fanaticism, who blindly rejected the proposal. Chinese and foreigners alike deeply regretted this, recognizing that the spirit of Sino-foreign cooperation that had been built up over the years had been undermined. Mr. Macdonald should bear the responsibility for this, but the small number of foreign ratepayers in attendance who did not carefully consider the matter and hastily passed the rejection are also a major cause.</p>
<p>This association believes that Macdonald's speech, with its confused organization, obsolete ideas, fabricated facts, lack of evidence, and utter worthlessness, and the results it led to, are naturally invalid and do not warrant a rebuttal. However, out of love for the spirit of Sino-foreign cooperation that has been built up over the years, we cannot bear to see it destroyed in a single day, lest unfortunate events occur. We must say a word to the citizens of China and foreign nations. However, before rebutting Mr. Macdonald's speech, this association should transcribe its declaration below to clarify its position (This association affirms that foreign ratepayers in the Shanghai International Settlement have no right to discuss or decide on the civil rights that Chinese ratepayers in the International Settlement should have. Based on this principle, the rejection of the proposal to increase the number of Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese directors by two at the Foreign Ratepayers' Meeting on April 16th is naturally invalid. This is solemnly declared.)</p>
<p>Upon investigation, Mr. Macdonald's speech was emotional rather than rational, destructive rather than constructive, and resulted in difficulties for foreigners and resentment from Chinese. His ideas were obsolete and violated the spirit of the times. Mr. Macdonald even forgot that he was British, thus disregarding the British government's recent diplomatic policy towards China. The speech, in a long meeting, could not have had any effect except to be deemed unworthy of adoption and unable to be established. The foreign ratepayers' meeting in the International Settlement is similar in nature to a temporary gathering of citizens, and the vast majority of the ratepayers in attendance did not have a deep understanding of the matter. After his arrogant speech, ignoring Chinese sovereignty and disregarding the Chinese nation, they almost all forgot that they were in a meeting hall located on Chinese territory, with an absolute majority of Chinese citizens outside the meeting. They acted like a group of children being hypnotized, resulting in the inevitable blind obedience of mass psychology. This is truly due to the deficiencies of the meeting system. Otherwise, why would foreign public opinion have severely criticized the outcome of the case and advocated for remedies?</p>
<p>This association believes that Mr. Macdonald's actions have not only split all the citizens of the International Settlement into two opposing sides, but have also dealt a blow to the British government's recent efforts to restore the goodwill of the Chinese people. This is truly unfortunate for the people inside and outside the settlement, and also unfortunate for the British government.</p>
<p>This association has no responsibility to refute Mr. Macdonald's attacks on the Shanghai Municipal Council directors, his claims that the proposal was made under pressure, and the lack of sufficient reasons. As for whether Chinese directors support the declaration of the Shanghai Businessmen's Federation, this association believes that if the declaration of the Shanghai Businessmen's Federation is a fair proposition, then any Chinese person would support it. Otherwise, even if they wanted to support it, justice would not allow it. The May 30th Massacre was caused by the abuse of power by the Shanghai Municipal Council director at the time. In order to ensure the implementation of the spirit of cooperation, the Chinese directors mediated and resolved part of the compensation, thus helping the British people out of a predicament. The May 30th Martyrs' Cemetery and the families of the May 30th Martyrs voluntarily donated 20,000 yuan for compensation, and the remaining construction costs were donated by Chinese people. This commemorates the martyrs who sacrificed for justice and humanity on that day, and there are reasons for it in both reason and emotion. The Chinese people still think that the construction of the May 30th Martyrs' Cemetery is too small, and the compensation issue is still pending, which is regrettable. The existence or non-existence of an anti-foreign movement depends entirely on whether foreigners have unreasonably oppressed the Chinese people. However, the Chinese people are a rational nation. Seeing that the Chinese people have remained peaceful, calm, enduring, and bearing the burden of injustice after Mr. Macdonald's insulting speech, awaiting a judgment of fairness and justice, is sufficient proof that the talk of an anti-foreign movement is entirely Mr. Macdonald's fabrication. The Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese directors are naturally seeking the interests of the Chinese people, just as foreign directors are seeking the interests of the foreign people. Otherwise, the Shanghai Municipal Council directors should be elected by all citizens, regardless of nationality, in a mixed election, without the need to stipulate in fact how many seats for Chinese, how many for British, how many for American, and how many for Japanese. But do Chinese only seek the interests of Chinese people, and do foreigners not only seek the interests of foreign people? Please look at the Shanghai Municipal Council budget. Is more used for the benefit of foreigners, or is more used for the benefit of Chinese? For example, in educational expenses, do foreigners account for more, or do Chinese account for more? All of the Chinese people oppose the sale of the electricity department. The Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese directors are elected by the Chinese people, and naturally take the intentions of the Chinese people as their intentions. As far as this association knows, Mr. Macdonald is a lawyer at the British Godefroy law firm, and many Chinese people register with that law firm. Perhaps he obtained the qualification to attend the Foreign Ratepayers' Meeting because of the support of the Chinese people. Now, he benefits from the Chinese people but turns around and bites them, wantonly undermining the interests of the Chinese people, which is truly beyond reason and emotion. This association deeply sighs.</p>
<p>In his speech, Mr. Macdonald stated that it is not known whether the Chinese directors can represent the Chinese people, how they are elected, what their political views are, what their position is, and how many Chinese taxpayers there are. From these few words, this association feels extremely sorry for Mr. Macdonald. The election methods and number of taxpayers of this association and the election situation are all disclosed in the newspapers. Anyone who can read Chinese characters knows this. Perhaps Mr. Macdonald has this argument because he entered the country without knowing its writing. To criticize a social event, one must pay attention to daily facts. Mr. Macdonald knows nothing about the news of this association in the newspapers, and his remarks naturally mostly become fabricated facts. Even though he has lived in China for eighty or ninety years, he is still completely ignorant, let alone eight or nine years.</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonald also extensively cited the history of the government's colonial policy in India in his speech to incite the psychology of self-importance among the foreign ratepayers in attendance, further proving the obsolescence of his mind, setting aside the British government's recent diplomatic policy, and encouraging British ratepayers to betray the British government. This association is greatly worried for the British government and its people traveling to Shanghai. Mr. Macdonald's words are sufficient to render the declarations of the British government, which is focused on professional pursuits and has no ambition for aggression, as worthless paper. At the same time, British people who are dedicated to professional pursuits and have no ambition for aggression while abroad risk seeing their professional standing shaken. This association feels particularly chilled on their behalf.</p>
<p>Mr. Macdonald quoted the imperial edict of the Qing Dynasty's Qianlong Emperor to the British Emperor in 1793 in his speech, further revealing his anti-Chinese ideology and attempting to use it to mobilize the foreign ratepayers in attendance to unite in an anti-Chinese movement. Whenever foreigners with aggressive ambitions encounter Chinese people seeking justice and resisting this kind of foreign oppression, they falsely accuse them of engaging in an anti-foreign movement. Like this kind of foreigner, both anti-Chinese and anti-foreign movements are not permitted by justice and fairness and should be corrected. Furthermore, the Qianlong era was a closed era, and its thinking was feudal and autocratic, which is not sufficient to represent the Chinese people of today. Moreover, this is just a kind of statement, which is less than the cruel behavior of the implementers of the three major massacres of May 30th, Wanhsien, and Shakee in the past five years. This association, which does not dwell on old grudges, wants to use these massacres to prompt foreigners like Mr. Macdonald to reflect on their own actions. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Actively Assist in the Proposal to Increase Chinese Directors</h3>
<p>Drafting Concrete Measures for Assistance</p>
<p>Meeting Set for Next Wednesday</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the Japanese community in Shanghai convened a meeting of Japanese taxpayers to discuss the special taxpayers' meeting. All attendees unanimously supported the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors. However, because only about thirty Japanese taxpayers were present that day, Directors Fukushima and Saito were concerned that the invitation was not comprehensive enough and that a consensus could not be reached. Therefore, after the meeting, they consulted with Mr. Hayashi Yūkichi, the president of the Japanese Residents Association, to determine concrete measures for active assistance. Mr. Fukushima and Mr. Saito were assigned to draft concrete measures for active assistance and distribute them to all Japanese taxpayers for careful study. A second meeting will be convened next Wednesday to finalize the measures. It is planned that all Japanese taxpayers will attend the special taxpayers' meeting on May 2nd and unanimously vote in favor of increasing the number of Chinese directors by two. According to Mr. Fukushima, increasing the number of directors from three to five is of great significance to the future administrative development of the settlement. From the perspective of the number of Chinese citizens within the settlement, there is also a sense of imbalance in the number of seats. This phenomenon is truly detrimental to the administration of the settlement. Therefore, he absolutely believes that Japanese citizens should actively assist in ensuring that the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors can be passed and established as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Liu Jiwen Sworn into Office Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday Appointed Heads of Nine Sub-Customs Stations</p>
<p>The newly appointed Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, Liu Jiwen, arrived in Shanghai on the 21st of this month. He first went to the Superintendent's Office to take over affairs. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the swearing-in ceremony was formally held in the main hall of the office. Zhang Qun, sent by the Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan of the National Government, and Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, attended to oversee the oath. The grand occasion of yesterday is recorded below in detail:</p>
<p>Guests in Attendance: Those who went to the Customs Superintendent's Office yesterday morning to attend the ceremony, besides Mayor Zhang Qun and his wife and Customs Administration Director Zhang Fuyun, included Xiong Shihui, Commander of the Songhu Garrison; Tao Baichuan, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters; Wu Zhennan, Director of the Coast Guard; Guo Chengen, Director of the Shanghai Arsenal; Guo Biao, Director of the Central Mint; Xu Weizhen, President of the Special District High Court Branch; Zhao Tieqiao, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; Chen Shiguang, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Leng Jun, Magistrate of Shanghai County; Zhu Yan, Director of the Land Bureau; Sun Jianhou, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau; Zhao Zhihao, representative of the Public Safety Bureau; Zhou Chucai, Lin Kanghou, Zou Bingwen, Chen Bingqian, representatives of the National Anti-Opium Association, and over two hundred others.</p>
<p>Ceremony Proceedings: (1) Overseeing officials take their seats; (2) Guests take their seats; (3) Superintendent takes his seat; (4) Stand at attention; (5) Sing the Party song; (6) Bow three times to the Party flag, the national flag, and the portrait of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen; (7) Chairman (Zhang Qun) respectfully reads Premier Sun Yat-sen's last will; (8) Superintendent takes the oath; (9) Overseeing officials Zhang Qun and Zhang Fuyun deliver speeches; (10) Guests (Xiong Shihui and Tao Baichuan) deliver speeches; (11) Superintendent replies; (12) Photograph; (13) Refreshments; (14) Ceremony concludes.</p>
<p>Superintendent's Oath: I, [Name], solemnly swear to sincerely follow the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's will, implement the Three Principles of the People, uphold national laws, and strive to be loyal to my duty. I resolve never to employ useless personnel, never to engage in self-enrichment or corruption, and never to accept bribes. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun's Speech: (Abridged) Today, Superintendent Liu takes office. I am here to attend the ceremony by order of the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan of the National Government. I deeply congratulate the nation on obtaining a talent. Mr. Liu has rich experience in municipal administration and finance in Japan and the United States. He followed the late Premier for more than ten years, directly receiving the Premier's teachings and showing excellent results in his work. In 1925, when the Northern Expedition began, I worked with Mr. Liu at the headquarters. At that time, Mr. Liu managed military provisions and made considerable contributions. After the establishment of the National Government, Mr. Liu was appointed mayor. Mr. Liu, during this initial period, did not fear difficulties, did not compromise, and did not avoid criticism in order to seek progress and success in his work. It can be said that he is the most loyal and diligent comrade of our party. Recently, due to accumulated overwork and heavy responsibilities, he intended to retire to study academics and investigate politics, but the National Government still entrusted him with the arduous task of Superintendent of the most important Jianghai Customs in the country. Mr. Liu has a long record of research on finance and is certain to be competent and contribute to national finance. Therefore, I dare to congratulate the nation on obtaining a talent. Recently, in Mr. Liu's office, I saw a slip of paper with the words "Integrity can be sold, but honor cannot be bought," which he kept on his desk to encourage himself and his colleagues. We can deeply believe that during Mr. Liu's tenure, he will be able to eliminate the accumulated bad habits of financial institutions and dispel people's doubts about financial institutions. I congratulate the nation, and I also congratulate Superintendent Liu personally.</p>
<p>Zhang Fuyun's Speech: (Abridged) In addition to managing regular customs revenue, the Customs handles matters between the Customs and the local people, which are reported by the Customs Superintendent or submitted to the government for decision. The Customs occupies an important position in the country. With Mr. Liu's past spirit of courage in undertaking responsibilities, he will certainly be competent and happy.</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui's Speech: (Abridged) Personal reflections: The Jianghai Customs is a Chinese customs. Why is it necessary for foreigners to manage tax revenue and set up a supervisory agency? When this system was first implemented, it was felt that British management of tax revenue was superior to that of our own people, resulting in the loss of major power and its inclusion in treaties. This is what we find most distressing. Shanghai is the world's largest commercial center, like Nantong compared to Dalian, the Pearl River basin compared to Guangzhou and Hong Kong, and Shanghai controls the Yangtze River basin. The Jianghai Customs is extremely important. Here, I have two hopes: (1) I hope the new Superintendent will fulfill his duties and reorganize the customs affairs; (2) Prepare to abolish foreign management of customs duties, so that Chinese management of tax revenue is truly superior to foreign management. During the Meiji Restoration in Japan, all navigation rights and postal services were entrusted to foreigners, with Japanese supervisors appointed. These supervisors constantly reorganized navigation rights and postal services until they were recovered. Looking at the roads in the former concessions of Hankou, Jiujiang, and Zhenjiang after their recovery, they are not as smooth as they used to be, indicating a lack of preparation. Superintendent Liu has had excellent results in the revolutionary process, so I deeply hope that after taking office, he will not only be able to rectify tax revenue but also further prepare to recover the self-management of tax revenue, in order to truly abolish unequal treaties.</p>
<p>Liu Jiwen's Reply: (Abridged) Today, I, Jiwen, am sworn into office. I am deeply honored by the attendance of representatives from the Central Government and various agencies. I have been an official for more than ten years, but I only know that I am a revolutionary party member and do not know what an official is. I followed the late Premier for more than ten years. In the future, I will act according to the spirit of the late Premier to thank the many guests present today.</p>
<p>Appointment of Heads of Sub-Customs Stations: Yesterday, the Superintendent's Office appointed the heads of various sub-customs stations as follows: Qian [Name] as Head of Tongru Sub-Customs Station; Deng Gang as Head of Chongqi Sub-Customs Station; Xu Jihua as Head of Haimen Sub-Customs Station; Xu Xichen as Head of Huangjia Jingjiang Sub-Customs Station; Yu Xijiu as Head of Mengfu Sub-Customs Station.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Immigrants Depart Today</h3>
<p>The First Batch Consists of Only Over Four Hundred People</p>
<p>The Zhejiang immigrants going to Liaoning to reclaim wasteland, departing from Shanghai, have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Because the disaster victims from Wenzhou can arrive in Shanghai last night, they are approved to be transported by the Huayang ship today. Yesterday, the reporter met the transportation commissioner, Mr. He Zhengrong, and was told about the transportation of immigrants and the wasteland reclamation, which is recorded below in detail:</p>
<p>Disaster Victims Arrived Last Night: The immigrants departing this time were initially set at 1,400, then changed to 800. Among them, Yueqing and Pingyang in Wenzhou suffered the most severe disasters last year, so the quota was also the largest. The rest, such as Taizhou, Zhuji, and Ruichang, each had only over thirty people. The first batch of more than three hundred people sent to Shanghai by the Shanghai-Hangzhou train had already boarded the Huayang ship yesterday. The remaining five hundred people from Wenzhou and Taizhou, who were supposed to come to Shanghai on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyan ship, were reported by the leading committee members Gao and Yao in a telegram that immigrants there could not be gathered as planned due to deep-rooted local sentiments. Currently, only about seventy people have reported and departed and are on the Haiyan ship, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 PM on the 25th. They will board the Huayang ship at the Jinliyuan Wharf that night. Therefore, only over four hundred people will be sent in the first batch. The disaster victims who boarded the ship last night were assigned cabins and managed by the committee members.</p>
<p>Departing Shanghai This Morning: The Zhejiang Provincial Government specially sent transportation chief Zheng Yu and commissioners He Zhengrong and Hu Ruyin to escort the immigrants along the way and accompany them on the ship. They are scheduled to leave Shanghai for Yingkou at 9:00 AM today. In the Northeast, Li Guangyu, Magistrate of Haiyan County, has been sent to Liaoning to take care of the immigrants' food and lodging after arriving in Shenyang and to liaise with the Liaoning Civil Affairs Department to distribute them to reclamation areas. A telegram has been sent to notify him. The expenses for this immigration are borne by the provincial government for those sent from Hangzhou and by the county governments for those sent from Wenzhou and Taizhou.</p>
<p>Wasteland Reclamation Plan: According to Commissioner He Zhengrong, the current population density in Zhejiang is about seventy people per square mile, almost the same as in Japan, while the eastern provinces have more land and fewer people, with only twelve or thirteen people per square mile. This time, the Zhejiang immigration to the Northeast is indeed the best way to seek a way out for the poor. It is not only beneficial to the people's livelihood and the national economy, but also the number of Japanese and Koreans reclaiming land in the Northeast has been increasing in recent years. A great source of profit is being occupied by foreigners, and it is also of great importance to our country's border defense. After the Zhejiang disaster victims arrive in Liaoning, they will be divided into two groups: the poor households with no assets will first be employed as laborers, while those with assets will claim land for self-cultivation, and the future development will be even greater.</p>
<p>Creating Irrigated Rice Fields in the Northeast: The Zhejiang investigation committee went to Liaoning last time and consulted with the Northeast authorities many times. Most of the currently cultivated land there is for sorghum, soybeans, and millet. It is planned to take advantage of this Zhejiang immigration to develop irrigated rice fields so that rice can be planted. The soil in the Northeast is four feet deep and suitable for planting, even more fertile than the soil in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After opening up irrigated rice fields, fertilizer can be exempted for two years, with abundant harvests and low costs. The farmers will become richer faster than in the Southeast. Mr. He also said that after personally inspecting the situation in Liaoning this time, he is determined to go to various counties and villages in Zhejiang to vigorously promote and persuade farmers not to be bound by local sentiments and to go to the Northeast to exploit the treasures.</p>
<p>Eight Sick People Sent Back: Among the more than three hundred immigrants who came to Shanghai earlier, eight suddenly fell ill and could no longer go to Liaoning. The committee director Zheng Yu and others decided to stop their transfer, and they have already been sent back to their hometown yesterday.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau</h3>
<p>Fifth Health Sports Meet</p>
<p>Scheduled to be Held on May 14th and 15th</p>
<p>The Health Sports Meet is held twice a year according to central regulations. It is an important policy of health administration to instill health knowledge in the public. If people can understand the importance of health, they will surely support it wholeheartedly. Even if they do not support public health, they will use appropriate methods to protect their own health. The Municipal Health Sports Meet was first created in this city. The first time was on a larger scale and attracted the most attention. Later, to save expenses, only small-scale propaganda was done. The Municipal Health Bureau has repeatedly received orders from the Ministry of Health that health propaganda is related to enlightening people's health knowledge and should be carried out seriously and not regarded as a formality. This year's (fifth) Health Sports Meet is planned to be held jointly with the Municipal Party Headquarters and various bureaus of the Municipal Government on May 14th and 15th. A plan and other documents have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. Preparation will begin once instructions are received.</p>
<h3>Traditional Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>Standards for Establishing Hospitals and Clinics</p>
<p>Approved by the Central Government</p>
<p>The Sixth District Party Headquarters of this city received a public letter No. 158 from the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday, which said: "To the point, the Secretariat of the Central Government replied to a letter from your association, submitted by the Sixth District Party Headquarters, that the Municipal Health Bureau intends to change the name of traditional Chinese medicine hospitals to clinics, which is obviously a contempt for traditional Chinese medicine. It is suggested that all Chinese and Western hospitals, whether public or private, should be called hospitals or clinics, and be prefixed with the words 'Chinese' or 'Western' to show the difference, etc., and forwarded for review. After approval, it was decided that it is not appropriate to call Western medicine 'hospitals' and traditional Chinese medicine 'clinics' uniformly. However, it is also inappropriate to call public ones 'hospitals' and private ones 'clinics,' as suggested in the letter. The name of 'hospital' or 'clinic' should be based on the scale and completeness of the facilities. It is handed over to the Ministry of Health for proper review. This letter is recorded for reference." Afterwards, a reply was received in letter No. 366 (meeting character 5935), which briefly stated, "Regarding the issue of hospital names, the Ministry has carefully reviewed it and believes that the letter's statement that the name of 'hospital' or 'clinic' should be based on the scale and completeness of the facilities is appropriate and should be promoted. Now, traditional Chinese medicine hospitals in various places that have considerable scale and equipment can also be allowed to have the name of traditional Chinese medicine hospital, and other measures should be formulated to manage them. Please check and forward this." etc. In accordance with the regulations, this is specially recorded and sent for reference. (Omission below)</p>
<h3>National Government Investigation</h3>
<p>Zhong Yanqing, Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau</p>
<p>Order the Executive Yuan to Handle the Matter to Accord with Public Opinion</p>
<p>The National Government, considering that the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau has achieved nothing and only disturbs the people, approved the issuance of an order to abolish it and ordered the Executive Yuan to investigate. The original order stated: "To issue an order, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau has been repeatedly requested to be abolished by various fishermen and merchants since its establishment. The government has previously issued an order to abolish the bureau because it has been operating for years without any achievements and ordered the Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to properly handle the matter and report back. Subsequently, the Yuan and the Ministry presented reports one after another, stating the case and listing various measures, and proposing to wait until the Fisheries Association Law is implemented before allowing fishermen and merchants to handle the matter according to law. The instructions were given separately and the abolition was temporarily postponed. Now, Huang Long, a fisherman and merchant, Yang Duxun, and Zhou Gaowei, an ice-fresh fisherman and merchant, have continued to file complaints about various malpractices of the bureau director Zhong Yanqing. After review by the government, the bureau director has numerous accusations and is indeed poorly managed, disturbing the people. An order should be issued to investigate to accord with public opinion. A copy of the original telegrams and supplementary presentations of the fishermen and merchants are hereby copied and sent to the Yuan, which will issue an order to the Ministry to comply and report back. This order."</p>
<h3>Current People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting, Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai by express train from Nanjing at 12:30 PM yesterday and arrived at the North Station at about 9:00 PM last night. Those traveling with him were Xu Mo, Director of the European and American Affairs Department, and Diao Minqian, Director of the Intelligence Department.</p>
<p>Sun Ke, Minister of Railways, and Yang Xingfo, Vice President of the Academia Sinica, both arrived in Shanghai by night train from Nanjing last night and arrived this morning.</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Fang Jue departed from Shanghai by night train for Nanjing last night.</p>
<h3>Gu Ziyan Resigns as Special Finance Commissioner for Fujian</h3>
<p>Approved by Minister Song</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Ziyan, the newly appointed acting Special Finance Commissioner for Fujian by the Ministry of Finance, originally intended to go to Fujian by boat to take over his duties. However, after investigating the financial situation in Fujian, it was found to be in a state of disarray. Moreover, the festival season is approaching, and Mr. Gu felt that he could not handle the task. Therefore, he went to Nanjing a few days ago to resign to Minister Song of Finance, which was approved.</p>
<h3>Commodity Inspection Bureau Requests Strict Prohibition of Farmers Mixing Inferior Cocoons</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau believes that the silkworm season is approaching and silk cocoons will soon be on the market. Farmers are selling cocoons with good and bad ones mixed together, which damages the quality of the cocoons and affects the factories. Therefore, Director Zou submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting that the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines be consulted to order the provinces, cities, and counties to strictly prohibit this. The original request stated: "Regarding the matter of submitting a request, in recent years, silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have reduced silk production, and supply cannot meet demand. Every year at the end of the year, or before the new cocoons are on the market, they stop work to wait, which reduces the amount of silk produced. The waste of time and the stagnation of capital are deeply related to the future of the silk industry. In addition, the suspension of work by laborers and unemployment have a greater impact on people's livelihoods. The fundamental solution depends on improvement. The reason why the supply of raw silk is insufficient is due to the inability to expand the silkworm area and the poor breed of silkworms and poor feeding. However, farmers raise silkworms, and it does not matter whether the cocoons are good or bad when selling them. Therefore, they do not pay attention to the method of picking cocoons, and the number of double cocoons and rotten cocoons is increasing day by day, and the amount of silk cocoon material is gradually decreasing, which is also a major reason. On the other hand, in Japan, when silkworm farmers sell cocoons, all double cocoons, thin-skinned rotten cocoons are eliminated and not allowed to be mixed with high-quality raw cocoons. The price of the cocoons is also determined by the quality. Therefore, the cocoon farmers obtain high profits, and the factories also avoid intangible losses. In addition, with proper feeding and silkworm breeding, the production of good cocoons has increased sharply, and the number of inferior cocoons has naturally decreased. Later, it has surpassed us and taken away the first place in silk production in our country. If our country wants to save the situation, it must quickly catch up and quickly eliminate the various shortcomings mentioned above. The silkworm farmers mix inferior cocoons, which damages the factories. Shen Huachen, the former chairman of the Shanghai Silk Factory Association, once drafted a prohibition method and submitted it to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines for approval and issued an order. However, the farmers have been ignoring it for a long time and continuing to mix inferior ones as before, which has become a habitual practice and is a major obstacle to the progress of the silk industry. In order to improve the quality of raw silk, the bureau should prepare a document stating the reasons and respectfully request your ministry to review it and consult the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines to reiterate the ban on mixing inferior cocoons when selling cocoons, and also consult the Nanjing and Shanghai special municipalities and the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provincial governments to order the municipal and county governments to notify the silkworm farmers that when selling fresh cocoons, they must not mix double cocoons, thin-skinned rotten cocoons, etc., so that the quality is clearly distinguished. At the same time, order the cocoon industry associations and silk factory guilds in various cities and counties to specifically inform the cocoon businesses and silk factories to strictly set the grades when purchasing fresh cocoons, and increase the value of pure cocoons, and slightly increase the price of mixed cocoons, so that the general cocoon farmers will naturally tend to sell fresh cocoons and do not want to mix them. In addition, order the silkworm mulberry test fields in various counties to be responsible for sending personnel to promote and guide the farmers, inform them of the advantages and disadvantages, so that the quality of raw silk can be gradually improved, and foreign trade can also develop day by day."</p>
<h3>Citizens' Association Actively Proceeding as Ordered</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Hold Inauguration Ceremony</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Special District Citizens' Association was actively prepared by the preparatory members and conveners appointed by the Municipal Party Headquarters. Several meetings were held and preparations were made. However, because the Chamber of Commerce continued to exist as usual, it could not be handed over as ordered, which led to the failure to formally establish it until now. Because the Central Government strictly ordered the Chamber of Commerce to stop its activities and the Municipal Party Headquarters instructed the preparatory committee of the Special District Citizens' Association to prepare as soon as possible, the preparatory committee members contacted each other yesterday. First, the Citizens' Training Association scheduled a meeting to invite the conveners to hold a meeting to decide the date of convening a meeting of all preparatory members. After the Municipal Party Headquarters appoints and announces the number of new preparatory members, it will then submit a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters to approve the date of inauguration and hold an inauguration ceremony for all members.</p>
<h3>Representatives of National Products Returning to Shanghai from Hangzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation went to Hangzhou on the 3rd of this month to participate in the First National Products Mobile Exhibition. After the closing ceremony on the 22nd, the remaining goods were shipped to Shanghai. Sun Choucheng, Director of General Affairs, Wang Shouyi, Transportation Committee Member, Mou Yueqiu, Zhang Baoshan, Executive Committee Members, Xu Qingwen, Clerk, and more than eighty people from various factory representatives and partners who stayed in Hangzhou, took the early express train to Shanghai yesterday. Lu Xingzhuang, Zhang Bingsen, Shen Mengshi, Ma Jisheng, Standing Committee Members, Chen Tianren, Secretary, and other manufacturers' representatives went to the station to welcome them, took cars to the meeting, and reported everything. They dispersed after a happy time after three o'clock.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Submitting Smoking Paraphernalia</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Orders Public Safety Bureau to Collect and Burn</p>
<p>The Municipal Government yesterday approved a consultation from the Anti-Smoking Committee, stating that Article 19 of the Implementing Rules for the Anti-Smoking Law stipulates that all instruments specifically used for smoking opium are not allowed to be collected and should be submitted to the local government for verification and collection for incineration, and violations will be punished according to law. Please instruct the subordinates to announce it to the public and set a deadline for submitting it for collection and incineration. It is reported that the Municipal Government has instructed the Public Safety Bureau to comply.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Issues a Notice to Bureau Members</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company issued a notice to bureau members, stating, "Regarding the fact that various newspapers have recently published reorganization plans of this bureau or the reorganization situation of a certain person, after reading them carefully, many of them do not conform to the facts. It is difficult to investigate whether the source of this news is a mistake made by the interviewer or an unintentional talk by colleagues of this bureau. All of our colleagues should know that we should work hard and emphasize practicality. Empty talk and exaggeration will only lead to ridicule. Although various reorganization plans have been set, they should not be published without authorization before they are actually finalized and submitted to the government for approval, so as not to confuse the audience and disrupt the system. If such a situation occurs again in the future, once the person who leaked the information is found out, they will be given demerits and warnings. Please ask each section chief to earnestly instruct colleagues to comply, this notice."</p>
<h3>Japanese Tourist Groups Arriving in Shanghai in Succession</h3>
<p>Recently, the scenery of Suzhou and Hangzhou is beautiful, and tourist groups organized by various Japanese groups are arriving in Shanghai in succession, which is very enthusiastic. Today, the Shanghai Maru arrived in Shanghai with more than ten city councilors from Gifu City to visit the scenery and inspect the municipal administration of Shanghai and Nanjing. On the 5th of next month, a visiting group organized by thirty members of the Kumamoto Chamber of Commerce will come to Shanghai. In addition, every time a connecting postal ship arrives in Shanghai, there will be one or two tourist groups coming to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Master and Servant are Slain Together - The Life of a Six-Year-Old Child Should not have been Cut Short</p>
<h3>Guo Chunsen Bedridden in Hospital, Narrowly Escaping Calamity</h3>

<p>Blood Congealed on Brocade Quilt ··· Corpses Strewn Throughout the Room</p>
<p>Siblings Rushed Back from School ··· Crying to Heaven at the Scene</p>
<p>Neighbors Filled with Dread ··· Police Paid Serious Attention</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around two o'clock, a massive case of family homicide involving seven people occurred suddenly at the residence of Guo Chunsen at No. 1169, Zhidelilong, Edwin Street, West Shanghai. Except for Guo himself, who was hospitalized due to illness at Baolong Hospital, and his two children who resided while studying at Fudan University, and his six-year-old eldest grandson, the entire household of seven, including male and female servants, were spared. The perpetrator(s) left behind two murder weapons, an axe and a kitchen knife, and fled without a trace. It was not until seven o'clock in the morning that the incident was discovered by neighbors, truly an unprecedented tragedy in Shanghai. The following is a detailed account based on the investigation conducted by our newspaper's reporter.</p>
<p>Once Served as Peace Negotiator Guo Chunsen, currently fifty years old, courtesy name Songnian, is from Guilin, Guangxi. He served as a member of the First National Assembly. In the seventh year of the Republic (1918), when the Northern and Southern governments were divided, the Northern government appointed Wang Yitang as the peace negotiator for the North-South negotiations. The Southern government had a seven-chief executive system of military government, with Cen Chunxuan as the chairman. Guo and Zeng Yan were both appointed as peace negotiators. Later, when Mo Rongxin served as the military governor of Guangdong, Guo served as the chief of staff of the governor's office. After Mo's departure in the ninth year of the Republic (1920), Guo left Guangdong and came to Shanghai, leisurely residing on the sea, living at No. 1169, the end of the first lane of Zhidelilong, Edwin Street, in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Family Situation Guo's eldest son, Boqi, twenty-three years old, and his unmarried younger sister are studying at Fudan University as boarding students. Boqi married Liu Yanqiu, the daughter of Liu, a giant ship merchant from Xiamen, at the age of seventeen. The following year, she gave birth to a son named Susheng, who is currently six years old. In the following years, two more sons were born, one named Dasheng, four years old, and one named Meisheng, three years old. In addition, there is a male servant, a cook, three maids, and Guo's wife, née Li, currently forty-four years old, making a total of twelve people in the family. Except for the eldest son Boqi and his younger sister who reside at school, there are a total of ten people living at home.</p>
<p>Guo Chunsen Recuperating in Hospital Guo Chunsen served in politics in his early years. Recently, due to declining health, he suffered from various illnesses. Two months ago, he suffered from bubonic plague, and medical treatment was ineffective. Later, he sought treatment at Baolong Hospital, and he recovered and was discharged after about half a month. However, after the fourteenth of this month, he was hospitalized again at Baolong Hospital due to a leg ulcer, staying in room 107, costing about five yuan per day. Aside from one servant, no one else visited him regularly.</p>
<p>Tragic Cries in the Deep Night The area around Zhidelilong, Edwin Street, is located in the western district of the Public Concession. Few people walk around at night. Around two o'clock yesterday morning, the residents of Zhidelilong were all sound asleep. However, a tragedy was unfolding in Guo Chunsen's home at this time. The neighboring family of a certain surname suddenly heard continuous, tragic cries of "Ah yo!" from the Guo family. Although the sound was clear, they regarded it as someone else's business and unrelated to themselves. Moreover, according to Shanghai's customs, people are unwilling to interfere in external affairs, and neighbors in the lane do not even know each other's names. At that time, the Guo family's cries were thought to be the master scolding the servants, so they remained unconcerned, unaware that a great unprecedented tragedy was unfolding in the Guo family.</p>
<p>Child's Cries Reported the Massacre Guo's eldest grandson, Susheng, only six years old, went out the back door around seven o'clock yesterday morning. When a neighbor saw him, they recognized him as the young master of the Guo family. Wondering why he was out alone so early, they stopped him from leaving. Unexpectedly, Susheng immediately burst into tears, saying that everyone in his family was dead. The neighbor's face changed color upon hearing this, and more and more people gathered. At that moment, a bodyguard from the He residence, the landlord of Zhidelilong opposite, heard Guo's grandson's words and immediately went with several neighbors. The bodyguard took the lead and entered the house.</p>
<p>Blood Flowing Like a River in the Back Courtyard When the neighbors arrived at the Guo family's home, they saw blood flowing like a river in the back courtyard, with an unbearable stench. In the back room below, where the male servant Guo Song'an and the cook Guo Chaolong usually slept together, Guo Chaolong's head was seen to have been hacked open, with only a thin layer of skin connecting the head and neck. The blood was dripping, an extremely gruesome sight. The bedding and clothes were all stained red. A wood-splitting knife was left on the ground. The male servant Guo Song'an was nowhere to be seen. The neighbors immediately became suspicious, and one side sent someone to report to the police while the remaining people went upstairs to investigate, seeing a scene of horror.</p>
<p>Entire Family Wiped Out After receiving the news, the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station immediately ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to go to investigate. They found that Ms. Liu Yanqiu, Guo's daughter-in-law, was lying in the bedroom above the parlor, her head also having been chopped off. She was twenty-three years old. The third son, Meisheng, only three years old, was still in the same bed with his mother Liu, and was also killed. The attic was where the maids Conggui and Chunlian, as well as the eldest grandson Susheng and the second son Dasheng, lived. Except for Conggui, who had fled, the rest had their heads chopped off. The bedroom on the west side of the upper floor was Guo's wife Li's bedroom, and she was forty-four years old. She lived with the youngest maid, Qiulian. Both of their necks had also been chopped off. A kitchen knife was left beside the bed, stained with blood.</p>
<p>Returning Home Sick After Suffering a Great Calamity The Chinese and foreign detectives at the police station, seeing that the case was of great importance, immediately reported to the head of the police station, who personally went to investigate. For the sake of future investigation, the police station used electric light to take photographs and obtain the truth. At the same time, they notified Guo Chunsen, who was staying at Baolong Hospital. Upon hearing the news, Guo, with his family suffering a great calamity, had no choice but to return home sick. Seeing the tragic scene, he was overwhelmed with grief. Then he summoned his children back, only telling them that their mother had died of illness. The eldest son Boqi and his daughter, who were attending class at Fudan University, rushed over in a hired car upon hearing the alarming news. His nephew Guo Cang, who was studying at Jinan University, was also summoned home by Guo's family.</p>
<p>Siblings Crying to Heaven Upon arriving home, Guo Boqi and his sister saw that their loving mother, beloved wife, and beloved son had all been brutally murdered. They cried to heaven, overwhelmed with grief. Then they inspected the jewelry, clothing, and valuables, which had all disappeared. The estimated loss was over several thousand yuan. The male servant Guo Song'an and the maid Conggui took the valuable items and fled, which was beyond doubt. They were now under strong suspicion for the tragic deaths of the seven members of the family. According to their family members, this massacre was unexpected. The male servant Guo Song'an was twenty-three years old and was usually quite honest. However, two months ago, Guo and the maid Conggui often had a close relationship, which the mistress Li often scolded.</p>
<p>Liu Yanqiu's Brocade Quilt Covered in Blood When reporters arrived at Guo's residence, they saw a sea of people at the entrance of the alley, all trying to see the excitement. Police detectives guarded the door with guns. When reporters arrived at Guo's home, they saw the victim Guo Chunsen sitting in a corner, looking dazed. Later, his nephew Guo Cang received the reporters, who spoke with great sighs. The residence was two rooms and one wing. The interior furnishings were not very luxurious. After inspecting the upper floor, they felt nothing but sadness. The brocade quilts and embroidered rugs on the bed of Guo's young wife, Liu Yanqiu, were all stained with blood. Half of the light green printed silk quilt was dragging outside, and the blood that had flowed down had already congealed. The boxes and brocade boxes were messy. The top of the bed canopy was also splattered with blood, which was likely due to excessive force during the chopping. After inspecting the other rooms, the entire floor was covered with blood stains, a tragic sight. It was heard that his eldest grandson Susheng was able to escape this tragedy because the maid Conggui usually took care of him, and Susheng was still sound asleep when Conggui left.</p>
<p>Serious Attention from Various Police Stations The public concession police stations believed that such a serious case had occurred in West Shanghai, with bizarre circumstances and particularly cruel events. It was a rare tragedy in the concession. Therefore, Chinese and foreign detectives and inspectors from various police stations rushed to investigate. They also took the victim to nearby photo studios to view various photographic negatives in order to strictly arrest the perpetrators. The seven corpses of the Guo family were transported by car to the Ferren Road morgue yesterday morning. Due to the late hour, the examination was delayed. It was decided to request the Special District Court to come to the scene for examination this morning.</p>
<h3>Bandit Robbery of a Car</h3>
<p>Kidnapping of Bank Employee</p>
<p>Anhui Native Zhu Yian Kidnapped by Bandits</p>
<p>Bandits Rented a Car from Aidu Automobile Company</p>
<p>Drove the Chauffeur Off the Car Midway After Kidnapping Zhu</p>
<p>The Original Car Was Found on Jiangwan Road</p>
<p>Anhui merchant Zhu Lvsong, who started his business with yarn and also ran a pawnshop, lived at No. 250, Yongdingli, Shanhai Pass Road, Public Concession. His eldest son Yian, a young man, worked at the China Industrial Bank. He was kidnapped by bandits on his way to work at around 8:45 yesterday morning on Qingdao Road. There were a total of four bandits, three of whom had handguns. They had previously rented a car, No. 12538, from the Aidu Automobile Company on Aidu Road, instructing the chauffeur to drive to the scene of the incident. Waiting by the roadside, the bandits helped Zhu out of his private car, forced him into the rented car, and drove him away. Car No. 12538 was found on Jiangwan Road at around 3 p.m. The whereabouts of the hostage are unknown.</p>
<p>Luring the Prey Zhu Yian, twenty-one years old, works in the issuing department of the China Industrial Bank on Tianjin Road. His monthly income is very meager. He goes to work at nine o'clock every morning and hires a private car for transportation. Chauffeur Liu San has been working for many years, picking him up and dropping him off every morning. Zhu usually takes Xinza Road to go to work, but recently, due to road repairs, traffic was inconvenient, so he changed to Qingdao Road. Who knew he would fall into the hands of bandits because of this? Yesterday morning around 8:40, Zhu went out as usual. While traveling on Qingdao Road, two men suddenly flashed out halfway, approaching the chauffeur Liu San. They showed their colors, instructing him not to make a sound, and pressed a gun against Liu's back, coercing him to drag his young master into the alley. The chauffeur had no choice but to drag the car into the alley under the guidance of the gun. Seeing that there was no one around, the bandits dragged Zhu out of his seat and onto the car at the alley entrance and drove away. When Zhu was dragged out of his private car by the bandits, he was forced by the bandits' power and could not look back to see what his master was doing before he left, so he could not recount it in detail.</p>
<p>Burning Incense at Longhua The car left waiting at the alley entrance by the bandits was rented from the Aidu Automobile Company west of the Nanjing Grand Theater on Aidu Road. The time was around 7:40 in the morning. A middle-aged man in a long robe came to the Aidu Automobile Company, claiming that he wanted to rent a car to go to Longhua to burn incense. The customer spoke in a local accent, speaking calmly, and claiming to be a regular customer who hired cars. The accountant did not suspect anything else and immediately ordered chauffeur Xue A'gen from Changzhou to drive out a purple-red Buick sedan, No. 12538 (City 509), to respond to the customer. After the car drove out, it headed west. The person in the car told the chauffeur to drive to Changsha Road first, as there were incense guests waiting for them there, and then it would not be too late to go to Longhua. The chauffeur obeyed and immediately turned north and released Changsha Road. When they reached the middle of Qingdao Road, the customer ordered the car to stop, equal to the alley entrance.</p>
<p>Unbearable to Look Back The car stopped by the roadside for about twenty minutes. At first, no one came. The chauffeur probed the customer with words, and the customer said that waiting a little while would not hurt and said that there were also children going to Longhua for sightseeing. It must be because they were taking time to wash and dress. While speaking, he scratched his head and pretended to frown, as if he disliked waiting. The chauffeur believed it to be true and did not say much. Who knew that while he was sitting there bored, he suddenly felt two men suddenly come and jump onto the driving government? The chauffeur Xue A'gen couldn't help but be shocked. Just as he was about to open his mouth to ask, the gun had already appeared on both waists. Knowing that the situation was dire, he didn't dare to make a sound. After the two bandits got in, one took Xue's seat and replaced him, and the other sat on his left, and turned the mirror on the car window that could reflect the rear inward, so that the chauffeur would not have to worry about looking back. Suddenly, he heard the sound of the car door opening and closing, which seemed very urgent. Zhu Yian was hijacked into the car by the bandits at this time. The two bandits pointed their guns at the chauffeur's waist on both sides, and if he moved even slightly, a slap in the face would come. Therefore, although he heard the sound, it was unbearable to look back.</p>
<p>Scouts Everywhere After Zhu Yian was kidnapped and the car was robbed, the concession police authorities sent scouts everywhere to investigate his whereabouts. The Aidu Automobile Company also sent out cars to search for car No. 12538 in the countryside. In fact, after the bandits kidnapped Zhu into the car, they took the Beijing Road Bund to Broadway Road and drove to the vicinity of the Zhaofeng Road intersection. The bandits braked, opened the door, and ordered the chauffeur Xue A'gen to get out of the car, and then drove away, disappearing in an instant. Car No. 12538 was not reported to the Aidu Automobile Company by the chauffeur of the Hongkou Automobile Company until 3:00 p.m. that this car had been found on the cinder road near the Chizhi University on Jiangwan Road, and then the detective from the Xinzha Police Station was asked to come and drag the car back. According to the chauffeur of the Hongkou Automobile Company, he passed Jiangwan Road at about 10:00 a.m. and saw car No. 12538 parked on the roadside. At that time, he passed by in a hurry, thinking that the machinery was damaged and stopped there, so he did not feel cold. It was not until 3:00 p.m. that he passed through the area again, and the car was still in the same place, which he found very strange, so he notified the Aidu Automobile Company by phone.</p>
<h3>Robbery of a Police Detective by Armed Robbers</h3>
<p>Cao Xirong's Home Robbed</p>
<p>Guns Drawn, Exchanging Fire, Wounded</p>
<p>Suspicious Patient Arrived at Tongren Hospital</p>
<p>Suspected to Be Related to the Case</p>
<p>At 8:10 last night, Cao Xirong's home at No. 288, Qingyunli, Shaqin Road, East Jiaxing Road Bridge, Hongkou, who served as a police detective at the Tilanqiao Police Station, was suddenly robbed. The robbers opened fire to resist arrest, and both sides fought fiercely. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Six Robbers Arrive Cao Xirong from Shandong, is currently serving as Police Detective No. 147 at the Tilanqiao Police Station in the Public Concession. His home is at No. 288, Qingyunli, Shaqin Road, East Jiaxing Road Bridge, Hongkou. At about 8:00 last night, six robbers suddenly came, using questioning as a reason to crowd in, drawing their guns to scare them into silence. First, they drove all the people in the house into one room, and then divided up to search. Two robbers kept watch downstairs, and four robbers went upstairs together.</p>
<p>Departure Home When the robbers were searching the house, Detective Cao was returning home from the police station. As soon as he entered the gate downstairs, the two robbers on watch knew that something was wrong and quickly looked up to warn the four robbers upstairs. The robbers then drew their guns and rushed downstairs, firing and fleeing. Detective Cao also drew his gun and returned fire. Both sides fired more than ten shots. The mixed number lasted about a few minutes. As a result, Detective Cao was shot in the head and twice in the right shoulder, immediately falling to the ground in pain. The robbers also took the opportunity to escape. Then, nearby detectives and arrests arrived after hearing the police and took Cao to the police station, and then transferred to the Shenjiawan Patrol Hospital. It was heard that the injuries were quite serious.</p>
<p>Pretending to Be the Victim About half an hour after the incident (8:45), a middle-aged woman suddenly accompanied a gunshot-wounded man to Tongren Hospital in Hongqiao for treatment. After the doctor examined him, he counted one bullet in the abdomen and one bullet in the left hip. He claimed to be Wen Zhuzheng, 37 years old, living next to the Laohuzao at the Datong Pier in the Sixteenth Barracks, a docker. Because he had thirty silver dollars with him, two robbers suddenly jumped out from the roadside when he passed the Jiaxing Road Bridge, showing their handguns. Because he resisted the robbers, he was shot, etc.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Police After the doctor asked in detail, he confirmed that it was a gunshot wound and immediately reported to the police station in charge by telephone. The head immediately ordered detectives to investigate. The language was unusually ambiguous and sent detectives to the supplied location to investigate the nearby detectives and the surrounding residents, who had not heard any police. And the estimated time and place of the incident coincided with the Cao Detective family robbery case. He immediately detained the woman and the injured person together and took them to the police station to investigate the truth and verify.</p>
<h3>Problem of Dredging the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Construction Requires About Six Years</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Authorities Inspect</p>
<p>Regarding the dredging of the Wusong River (i.e., Suzhou Creek), since Director Song Ziliang of the Dredging Bureau has been keen to dredge, and because of construction issues, the Construction Committee has repeatedly met on dredging methods. It is heard that the Construction Committee has decided to organize a dredging committee for the Wusong River, together with the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to supervise the Dredging Bureau to carry out the work. However, this matter is of great importance. It is estimated that the dredging and revetment pier projects will be carried out in sections, requiring about six years. Director Song recently invited the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and Mr. Kangding, a director of the Public Concession Public Works Department, to take the Lijicha Lun from the Waibaidu Bridge to the Vanhuangdu, inspecting it section by section, following the map, and making detailed plans. Once decided, the relocation of ships along the river and the dismantling of the pier will be announced to facilitate construction. However, it is heard that although the dredging of Suzhou Creek this time is to facilitate transportation and develop commerce, the first to benefit are the public concessions. The matter of how to request the Public Works Department to subsidize the river dredging funds is currently being studied in detail.</p>
<h3>Xu Kangfu's Concubine</h3>
<p>Children Sue for Inheritance</p>
<p>Three Children as Plaintiffs</p>
<p>Concubine as Legal Representative</p>
<p>Claiming an Inheritance of 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Requesting Distribution According to Six Shares</p>
<p>After the death of Xu Kangfu, the former accountant of the General Chamber of Commerce, who died of illness the year before last, he left behind one wife and one concubine, and four children, who came to live separately. Now Xu Chen, Xu's concubine, with her six-year-old son Xu Yongnian, and fifteen-year-old daughter Xu Baolin, eleven-year-old daughter Xu Fulin, etc., as plaintiffs, the woman herself holding the position of legal representative, hired lawyer Yu Zhongluo to file a complaint with the Shanghai District Court, accusing the defendants Xu Shen (i.e., Xu Kangfu's first wife), Xu Yongchun, and mother and son of seizing the inheritance, requesting analysis according to six shares, etc. The terms are roughly: The plaintiff currently lives at No. 616, Jingxingli, North Henan Road. The agent is forty years old this year. Her husband Xu Kangfu served as the accountant of the General Chamber of Commerce for many years during his lifetime. After his death the year before last, the inheritance was very large and was taken away by the defendants. After mediation and negotiation by relatives and friends, the defendants were given a living allowance of 60 yuan per month, but after October of last year, the defendants stopped paying. All the inheritance, such as more than 9,000 yuan of shares in the Great World, more than 7,000 yuan of savings in the Lao Jiuzhang Silk Shop, more than 3,000 yuan of shares in the Commercial Press, and 600 yuan of savings in the Siming Bank, totaling more than 20,000 yuan, are requested to be distributed according to six shares, etc. The defendants Xu Shen and Xu Yongchun also hired lawyer Zhao Zuwei to file a defense, stating that the husband had taken Xu Chen as a concubine, living separately and cooking separately. The late husband lived in the concubine's residence for more than ten years. In the summer of the year before last, the husband died in the concubine's house, so the defenders transported the husband's remains back home to bury him and mourn him. Although there is a small amount of inheritance, it is not worth three or four thousand gold. The defenders repeatedly asked the agent to live together so that they could save money, but the agent refused all along, not knowing what the intention was, and should be refuted, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Du opened a court hearing. Both parties arrived in court with lawyers. First, the plaintiff's agent Xu Chen pleaded the previous situation and requested analysis according to shares. The defendant Xu Chen said that she was 51 years old and from Shanghai. Xu Yongchun said that he was 22 years old and lived at No. 51, Shengshunli, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, and recounted the past. The questioner considered that the case was a family dispute and instructed the lawyers of both parties to reconcile it outside, with a deadline of three weeks. If there is no possibility of reconciliation, then a collective trial will be scheduled, and then the court will be adjourned.</p>
<h3>Married Woman Uses</h3>
<p>Criminal Litigation to Fight for Inheritance</p>
<p>Old Mother Is Already Seventy-Nine Years Old</p>
<p>Comes to Court with Daughter-In-Law and Grandchildren to Defend</p>
<p>Plaintiff's Purpose Is to Fight for Property</p>
<p>And Withdraws the Criminal Suit in Court</p>
<p>Recently, a woman Chen Wang and her mother Wang Lu, sister-in-law Wang Zeng, nieces Wang Fuzhen, Fuhua, Fumin, Fuying, Fuyong, etc., were involved in a lawsuit in the Special District Court for the inheritance of her late father Wang Yongchang. At the first trial yesterday, the entire family appeared in court. According to the plaintiff Chen Wang's complaint, after her father Yongchang passed away, the inheritance was managed by her mother Wang Lu and her brother Wang Baoshan. Her brother also died last year. He saw the content of the announcement published in the newspaper by Junyuan, which said that Wang Zeng had entrusted a lawyer to request Junyuan to grant her the right to manage her brother Baoshan's inheritance. She and Baoshan were children born to her late father. According to the current party program and the laws and regulations of the National Government, men and women are absolutely equal. Regardless of whether a woman is married or not, she has equal inheritance rights. She actually enjoys the same rights to the inheritance. How was the share book held by Wang Zeng drawn up, she never heard of it. However, she was arbitrarily disposing of the property that she should have obtained, which clearly constituted a crime under Article 356 of the Criminal Law, and requested that it be ordered to be re-analyzed on an average basis, etc. According to the defendant Wang Lu and others, in the defense complaint, Yongchang was a bookkeeper in the wooden line during his lifetime. The family was poor. He passed away on May 22, 23rd year of Guangxu (1897). His son Baoshan, first as a laborer, accumulated more than 20 years of hard work, with a little surplus of resources. Unfortunately, he died on October 19, 14th year of the Republic (1925), leaving behind only his wife Zeng (45 years old) and daughters Fuzhen (38 years old), Fuhua (26 years old), Fumin (24 years old), Fuying (23 years old), Fuyong (20 years old), etc. Later, because Fuzhen and others had grown up, each sought analysis. Although there was a dispute, they soon reconciled. Fuzhen and others then inherited their father's property, but the informant left the cabinet because of</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>She was addicted to smoking and gambling, which led to the decline of her family. Her son Baoshan also provided financial assistance during his lifetime, and Fuzhen and others often provided relief. The informant was greedy and listened to rumors, misunderstanding the law that married women inherited property, intending to blackmail, and knowing that there was no reason to win, to avoid litigation costs and to harm others, so she filed a criminal prosecution. And this family property was entirely accumulated by Baoshan. How can the informant enjoy it? Her late husband Yongchang passed away in the 23rd year of Guangxu. Baoshan began to inherit at that time. At that time, unmarried women did not have the right to inherit property, let alone married women. (The interpretation of the Judicial Yuan on the 19th of November in the 18th year of the Republic (1929) on the law of inheritance rights of women's property, omitted.) And Baoshan died on October 19, 14th year of the Republic (1925). The original claim referred to last year, which was obviously false. Therefore, this petition requests to refute the plaintiff's lawsuit, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Zhitan opened a court. Except for Fuhua, Fumin, and Fuying, the remaining defendants arrived in court, among whom Wang Lu was 79 years old, with white hair fluttering. Three generations of grandparents and grandchildren came to court together, which was also a misfortune for the family. First, the plaintiff Chen Wang stated that her late father had an inheritance worth more than 300,000 yuan, which was first managed by her brother Baoshan. Her brother died in the 14th year of the Republic (1925). Her nieces Fuzhen and others had come to discuss the matter of analysis. At that time, she was promised a share, but later she was not allowed to know and was arbitrarily analyzed into eight shares. Her mother, sister-in-law, and Fuzhen's five sisters each got one share, and the remaining share was given to Fuzhen's son, and she got nothing, so she filed a lawsuit, etc. Judge Ge asked her whether she wanted to prosecute the defendants for criminal offenses because she had filed a criminal complaint. The woman replied, "My purpose is to seek a share of the property, and I do not hope that the defendants will be subject to criminal penalties." Judge Ge then briefly questioned the defendants who arrived in court and said to the plaintiffs and defendants, "This case is a lawsuit for analysis of inheritance. The plaintiff also stated in court that she did not want the defendants to be subject to criminal penalties. This case is completely a civil lawsuit and does not involve criminal matters." He also asked the plaintiff whether she could automatically request to withdraw from the case. At that time, Chen Wang also knew that she should not have filed a criminal prosecution. After hearing the order, she immediately declared that she was willing to withdraw the lawsuit. The court approved it. Thus, this three-generation property dispute criminal case came to an end.</p>
<h3>Special District Court Trial</h3>
<p>Brother-Killing Case Criminal</p>
<p>Police Investigation Confirmed</p>
<p>Sun Shibao Actually Killed His Brother</p>
<p>Family Forcibly Resisted During Arrest</p>
<p>Three People Charged with Obstructing Official Duties</p>
<p>Anhui native Sun Shibao, Sun Xia, and Sun Zhu were accused of murder. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu of the Special District Court held a trial. According to the police lawyer Ru Bao-yi, the defendant Sun Shibao killed his elder brother Sun Shilin with an axe on February 12th of this year at 5:45 AM. Sun Xia had two sons, Shilin (the elder) and Shibao (the younger). Zhu was the younger daughter-in-law, while the elder daughter-in-law was Wang. They all lived at No. 1753 Yinghua Lane, Robert Road.</p>
<p>Suspected Brother Had an Affair with Wife, Shibao was a carpenter, and Shilin was a steward on the Dehe Steamboat. Shilin returned home on January 26th of this year. On the evening of February 9th, Shilin asked his younger brother's wife, Sun Zhu, to bring the lamp upstairs. She looked for something upstairs for a while before coming downstairs with Shilin. At this time, Shibao returned home and saw his wife walking with his brother, immediately becoming suspicious. He argued with his wife that night.</p>
<p>Cries for Help Heard Upstairs On the night of the 11th, Shibao and his wife argued again. Shibao said to Zhu, "You've done a fine thing. I'll kill you both in the future to vent my anger." Shilin's wife overheard this. The next morning, the 12th, Sun Xia suddenly heard Shilin calling for help upstairs. She went upstairs with Wang and saw Shilin's head injured by an axe and on the verge of death. They reported to the Putuo Road Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. Shilin was still able to speak but soon died.</p>
<p>Axe Still Had Blood Stains Afterwards, the police found the case quite bizarre and launched an investigation. When Shilin was murdered, only Sun Xia, Sun Shibao, Sun Wang, and Sun Pei's husband, Sun Chunqing, were at home. The police took these four to the police station for questioning and found a bloody axe in the stove room of the house. Therefore, they suspected that the crime was committed by someone in the family. However, due to lack of evidence, the four were temporarily released.</p>
<p>Bit Off Detective's Finger Shibao disappeared immediately after being released, which indicated that he was the murderer. The court issued a warrant for his arrest. Last night, they learned that Shibao had returned home and went to arrest him. When the detectives arrived at his home, Sun Xia and Sun Zhu came out to stop them and even bit the finger of detective Yao Changmin. Therefore, the two women were charged with obstructing official duties.</p>
<p>The Murderer Was Indeed Shibao According to the police investigation, the deceased and his wife had been estranged for five years and had not lived together. He also had many disagreements with his family. Therefore, Sun Xia deliberately concealed the truth. Because the family relied on Shibao for a living, they were afraid that their livelihood would be cut off if Shibao was arrested. However, the defendant still denied being Sun Shibao, claiming that his name was Xia Shaozeng and that Sun Xia was his aunt. Therefore, Sun Xia also denied that he was her son, and Sun Zhu even denied that he was her husband. But the police were certain that the defendant's name was Sun Shibao without any doubt.</p>
<p>Shibao Vigorously Denied A photo of Shibao found in Sun's house was presented as evidence to the defendant. He claimed that he was not Sun Shibao but Xia Shaozeng and that he, Shibao, and Shilin were cousins. Sun Zhu testified that her husband Shibao was dead. Judge Wu questioned Sun Xia briefly and ordered the defendants to be detained separately for another hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>6,000 Yuan Worth of Cloth</h3>
<p>Robbed in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The Incident Occurred on the 8th of this Month</p>
<p>The Case Was Only Solved the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Thieves and Those Who Sold the Stolen Goods Were Arrested Together</p>
<p>The Original Stolen Goods Were Allowed to Be Returned to the Plaintiff First</p>
<p>New Prosperity, Yongfengli, and Yishunheng, three customs brokerage firms, hired a dock boat belonging to Fan Xiaohai and Song Changfa on the evening of the 8th of this month at 7:30 PM. They loaded nine boxes and one package of Zhigong wool, silk, and other fabrics, worth 6,000 yuan, at the Mitsubishi Company dock. They intended to transport them to the Longmao Warehouse dock in Pudong for transshipment onto the Zhaoxing Company's Lianxing Steamboat, preparing to transport them to other ports. When Fan's boat sailed through the Suzhou Creek estuary and returned to the center, a small boat sped over. Eight robbers were hidden in the boat. When they approached Fan's boat, the robbers jumped aboard. Two robbers took out handguns and tied up the two crew members, locking them in the cabin. Three robbers steered the boat to the Wuzhen Road Bridge on the Suzhou Creek and unloaded the nine boxes and one package of rejected goods, loading them onto a cargo truck and driving north. After the robbers left, the two tied-up crew members managed to loosen the ropes and go ashore, reporting the incident to the customs brokerage firms, who reported it to the Weituoma Road Water Police Station, requesting an investigation. The three customs brokerage firms offered a reward of 1,000 yuan to apprehend the robbers. Until the day before yesterday (the 23rd), at approximately 1:00 PM, the Water Police Station detectives Sun Agui, Wang Haiquan, Cheng Yongnian, Huang Zhenlin, etc., arrested the robbers Jiangbei native Ji Chunbao (also known as Ji Chunbao) and Pudong native Wan Jinbao on Aiduya Road and Ailaige Road in the French Concession, bringing them back to the police station. Wan confessed that the stolen goods were sold to Ruirong Silk Cocoon Store at No. 194 Wenge Situo Road in the Public Concession. The detectives reported this to Western Police Chief Kailiqiao, who, the next day, jointly with Huisi Police Station detective Xie Wanfang and Western detective from No. 118, searched the Ruirong Store and found three boxes of stolen goods, totaling 146 pieces. They arrested the store owner Gu Peiqing, a native of Shaoxing. Gu said that the pieces were introduced by Wan Zhongliang from Huzhou, who brought a person surnamed Zhao to store them. The detectives went to No. 171 Yuanda Store nearby and apprehended Wan, while Zhao escaped. Wan further confessed that Zhigong wool was mortgaged by him at Xu Bingji Silk Spinning Store at No. 362 Sheng'an Lane, Ningbo Road. The detectives went to the store, confiscated nine pieces of stolen Zhigong wool, and brought the store owner Xu Bingquan, a native of Shaoxing, to the Huisi Police Station for detention. Until yesterday morning, the Water Police and Huisi Police Stations sent the arrested Ji and Wan, the two robbers, and Gu, Wan, and Xu, the three who received the stolen goods, to the Special District Court, Second Criminal Court. Judge Wu Tingqi, along with Prosecutor Xu Meisheng, sat for the trial. The plaintiffs, New Prosperity Chang and the other two customs brokerage firms, hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to appear in court. Police lawyer Ru Bao-yi stated the case and requested a postponement to investigate and recover the remaining stolen goods. The Chinese and Western detectives reported the details of the case and presented the stolen goods as evidence. When questioned, the defendants Ji Chunbao and Wan Jinbao confessed that they were hired by Chen Changfa, who was still at large, to row the boat. Ji received a reward of 20 yuan, and Wan received 17 yuan. They did not know anything else. However, when the goods were unloaded, a person surnamed Zhao loaded the pieces onto a truck and transported them to the Ruirong Store. Wan Zhongliang had seen Changfa and others at the Asia Hotel. When questioned, Wan Zhongliang confessed that he lived with the person surnamed Zhao and introduced him to Xu Bingquan to mortgage the pieces because Zhao wanted to borrow 2,000 yuan. Xu Bingquan hired lawyer Liu Shichao to defend him, saying that Xu knew nothing about this matter. Gu Peiqing testified that he also knew nothing about it and that Wan had stored the goods secretly. Finally, plaintiff lawyer Jiang Yiping stated that all the confiscated stolen goods were currently in the police station's courtyard and that the weather was uncertain, fearing that the goods would be damaged by water. Therefore, he requested permission to return them first. After Judge Wu verified the confessions, he ordered Ji Chunbao, Wan Jinbao, and Wan Zhongliang to be taken back to the police station for detention. Xu Bingquan and Gu Peiqing each posted a bail of 2,000 yuan to await another hearing at a later date. All recovered stolen goods were allowed to be claimed by the plaintiff first.</p>

<p>Preventing Meningitis Epidemic</p>
<p>Injecting Workers with Preventive Vaccines</p>
<p>The Health Bureau, in view of the occurrence of cerebrospinal meningitis in neighboring areas, has provided assistance to prevent the disease and implemented various preventive methods in the city. Every day, personnel are sent to factories to inject workers with free cerebrospinal meningitis preventive vaccines. Since the implementation of free injections until April 15th, a total of 77 factories and organizations have been visited in one month, with 44,660 people receiving injections. The injections are intended to protect the health of workers and prevent the spread of cerebrospinal meningitis. However, the level of education of workers in various factories is uneven, and the number of people willing to be injected depends entirely on whether the factory supervisors are enthusiastic in persuading them. The number of factory supervisors who care about the health of workers and enthusiastically persuade them is still small. Therefore, the injections have not been popularized among workers. Some have never been injected, and some have only been injected once and not a second time. It can be seen that most factory supervisors have not been able to pay close attention to the protection of the health of workers. It is necessary for the administrative authorities to plan and supervise the methods further. The bureau plans to expand the scope of cholera preventive vaccine injections in the future and discuss joint promotions with the Municipal Party Committee, Social Bureau, and Public Security Bureau. Cerebrospinal meningitis in this city was originally only sporadic and not an epidemic. The bureau is now reporting that the number of cases in various hospitals has declined, so the free injections of cerebrospinal meningitis preventive vaccines will end at the end of April.</p>
<h3>Appeal After the Banning of Superstitious Items</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of the Interior recently issued an order banning superstitious items such as tin foil, firecrackers, paper effigies, and funerary objects, the tin foil industry, the firecracker industry, and the paper effigy industry in this city are terrified of losing their livelihoods. The day before yesterday, they specially sent representatives Zhang Zhenfan, Wu Jian'an, and Wu Gengyun to request assistance from the Candle Industry to jointly make a broader appeal. The industry convened a meeting of the Smoke and Exchange Industry Association to discuss countermeasures. Mr. He Yinsheng expressed his opinion that Zhu Min, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, is planning to submit a request to the National Government to order the ministry to modify the handling of the banning of superstitious items. It is hoped that the government will take into account the difficulties of the people and be able to obtain such modifications. As for the candle and incense industries, the association has separately submitted requests for clarification, stating that they are daily necessities, and it has been noted on record. Now that the tin foil industry, etc., has requested cooperation, the industry will, when necessary, make a legitimate appeal based on the principle of people's livelihood. It is said that the smoke and exchange industry attaches great importance to this matter. Because of the reorganization, an announcement will be made as soon as it is completed.</p>
<h3>Former Provisional Court Documents</h3>
<p>Permission to Exchange for Ministry-Issued Documents</p>
<p>Deadline is the End of April</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Special District High and District Courts, the deadline for the use of various documents sold by the former Provisional Court and the Court of Appeal was limited to April 10th. An announcement had been made. However, the lawyers in this city had purchased and stored many of these documents. If those that had not been used by April 10th were to be discarded, it would be too uneconomical. Xu Weizhen, President of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, and Wang Zhennan, Chief Prosecutor, specially telegraphed the Ministry of Judicial Administration, requesting a modification of the measures. An order has been issued approving an extension until the 30th of this month. Xu and Wang jointly announced yesterday, announcing the permission to exchange for Ministry-issued documents. The Ministry of Judicial Administration's telegram states, "The office is aware of your telegram. Lawyers and litigants who have purchased and stored various temporary documents sold by the former Shanghai Public Concession Provisional Court and the Court of Appeal will be allowed to have the Shanghai Lawyers Association exchange them for Ministry-issued documents from your branch court before April 30th of this year. They will be void after the deadline. Immediately announce this to the public. The exchange of the documents from the former Provisional Court should be reported for special reimbursement and must be observed." Therefore, we hereby announce this to the public.</p>
<h3>Westerner Shoots Japanese Thief</h3>
<p>A Thief in Western Suit Trespassed the Wall to Steal</p>
<p>The Japanese Man Cursed Unceasingly</p>
<p>At approximately 3:00 AM yesterday morning, at the home of a Westerner at No. 153 Bei Shanzhong Road in the French Concession, a thief dressed in a Western suit was about to climb over the wall to steal when he was spotted by the Westerner. Without making a sound, the Westerner took out his self-defense pistol and fired three shots at the thief. One bullet hit the thief's ankle, causing him to fall to the ground immediately. He was then apprehended. Upon closer inspection, he was a Japanese man. The Westerner immediately reported the incident to the Shanzhong Road Police Station, which sent detectives to take the injured thief to Guangci Hospital. It is said that when the police detectives went to the hospital to question him, the thief was still cursing arbitrarily.</p>
<h3>A Hooligan Was "Planted with Lotus Flowers"</h3>
<p>Yong native Ding Amao, 25 years old, lived at No. 9 Chengda Lane, Old Garbage Bridge. He used to be in the steamboat business but has now become a hooligan, making a living by extortion. Yesterday evening, he was summoned to Suzhou Road Bridge on South Sichuan Road to mediate a dispute. Soon, four people from the other side arrived. After meeting, they disagreed and dragged Ding to the ground, tied his limbs with hemp rope, and threw him into the Huangpu River ("planting lotus flowers" in slang). Fortunately, Chinese police officer No. 1433 from the Central Police Station saw this and immediately tried to rescue Ding. He hired a car to send him to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, the perpetrators had already fled.</p>

<h3>195 Cases of Explosives</h3>
<p>Detained for Lack of Passport</p>
<p>Qian Zuomin, patrol captain of the Wusong Fourth Detachment of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol, inspected two suspicious wharf boats near Donggou, Pudong, the day before yesterday. They found as many as 195 cases of explosives in the cabin. Zhu Hesheng, an Anhui native who was escorting the explosives, was arrested. The seized evidence was taken to the detachment. After a brief interrogation by the patrol officer, it was transferred to the South City Brigade. During the preliminary trial by Captain Xu, Zhu, 21 years old, confessed that the explosives, totaling 195 cases, were hired by the wharf to load two boats and ordered him to escort them to Pingqiao, Hangzhou, to be used for blasting mountains. The captain believed that since he was transporting a large number of explosives without a passport, he was undoubtedly a smuggler. He ordered a report to be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Interesting Incident in a Divorce Case</h3>
<p>Old Sisters Quarrel Violently</p>
<p>A Bag of Feces as a Prank</p>
<p>Guan Zhao, a 55-year-old woman from Yancheng, lived in Qingyan Zuo Alley in the South City. She had a daughter named Lin Di, 25 years old this year, who was fairly attractive. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), she was betrothed through a matchmaker to Yin Quan, the son of Shen He'gao, the brother-in-law of Zhao, who lived at No. 21 Shide Lane, Youche Wharf. They had been married for three years. However, after Lin Di married into the family, she was always displeased because her husband was deaf and lacked a proper business. Therefore, there were constant quarrels between the couple, and the sound of criticism reached outside the house. Fearing that they would not be able to grow old together in this situation, she filed a complaint with the Shanghai District Court a few days ago, requesting a divorce. Yesterday, after the court ordered the defendant Shen He'gao and others to appear, Zhao, Shen's wife, received the summons. She assumed that her sister Guan Zhao had instigated the action. Filled with anger, she immediately resorted to a prank. She secretly prepared a bag of feces and rushed to her sister's house at 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon. At first, she made a serious protest, but when they disagreed, a conflict broke out. Guan Zhao was weak and unable to resist, falling to the ground. Shen Zhao immediately poured the feces she had prepared into her mouth, causing Guan Zhao's face, neck, and other parts of her body to be covered in filth, with an unbearable stench. Guan Zhao, at this point, was also filled with uncontrollable anger. She used all her strength to prop herself up and managed to grab her sister Shen Zhao, going to the first sub-station of the first district to file a complaint for investigation. The director ordered them to be detained temporarily for preliminary review.</p>
<h3>Why Commit Suicide Because of Illness?</h3>
<p>Zhou Qintao Rescued After Jumping into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The Longmao Steamboat Company's ferryboat, running between Wuma Road in Puxi and Longmao Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong, was returning to Pudong from Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday. Just as it arrived in the center of the river, near the bow of a British warship, a young passenger jumped into the Huangpu River to commit suicide. Fortunately, he was rescued by British sailors on the warship's small motorboat. Xia Abao, the steamboat's captain, sent him to the Water Police Station. According to the young man's confession, his name was Zhou Qintao, 21 years old, from Guangdong. Because he suffered from headaches and the treatment was ineffective, he became tired of life and jumped into the river to end his life. He had a friend in Shanghai named Zhou Fugen, who was a tea server at the Zhonghua Fengji Flour Company at No. 50 Tianzhutang Street. According to the confession, the police chief advised him, "It is common for an illness to not heal immediately. Why are you so short-sighted and seek death because of illness? The best course of action now is to go home and seek medical treatment." After finishing his admonishment, he ordered the detectives to summon his friend to take him away.</p>

<h3>Recent News on the Meiya Silk Factory Strike</h3>
<p>The Second Factory Has Resumed Work</p>
<p>The Meiya Silk Factory workers, on the grounds that the management did not fulfill the agreed-upon conditions, jointly went on strike with the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth branches. The details have already been reported in various newspapers. It is now reported that the Municipal Social Bureau, together with the Municipal Party Committee's People's Training Committee, issued a notice ordering a return to work. The Second Factory complied with the order and resumed work on the morning of April 22nd. The remaining factories have delayed their return to work and are said to be handled separately. Detailed explanations and instructions have been given regarding the workers' requests, and they should be followed. The following is an excerpt from the original text: (A) Regarding the factory's violation of the conditions agreed upon by labor and management, (1) Regarding the refusal of standing committee members of the labor union, the factory must not refuse representatives of the labor union that has been approved and registered by the government. (2) Regarding the extension of working hours and the signing of temporary worker contracts, if the factory needs all workers to extend their working hours beyond 10.5 hours, it must first obtain the consent of the labor union and then post a notice. If the factory posts a notice unilaterally without the consent of the labor union, workers who do not come to the factory to work will not be considered absent. The contract format for temporary workers must first be submitted to the bureau for approval. When necessary, it can be signed temporarily by the factory and the temporary workers. (3) Regarding the failure of miscellaneous apprentices to increase their wages after six months of work, the factory should provide a daily allowance of four yuan. (4) Regarding the failure to issue merit and demerit bonuses as in 1927, the rules for merit and demerit should be submitted by both labor and management, stating the reasons, and submitted to the bureau for approval. (5) Regarding national holidays promulgated by the National Government, where no rest or wages are given, the orders of the National Government should be followed. (6) Regarding workers injured at the factory due to work or suffering a sudden illness during work hours, the factory is not responsible for medical expenses or wages, the factory should follow the provisions of Article 7 of the labor-management agreement. (7) Regarding the failure of the gatekeepers to promptly notify workers when their relatives and friends come to the factory to visit for important matters, the labor side should follow the provisions of Article 15 of the factory rules and regulations, but the gatekeepers must not deliberately make things difficult. (B) Regarding the conditions imposed by the factory, 1. Regarding apprentices and miscellaneous apprentices who are promoted to formal workers upon completion of their apprenticeship, and the issuance of fixed-term employment contracts to old workers, old workers may be exempted from signing employment contracts. Apprentices promoted to formal workers upon completion of their apprenticeship and newly hired workers must sign employment contracts. 2. Regarding workers' savings, which cannot be withdrawn for urgent matters, the factory should submit the savings regulations to the bureau for approval before proceeding. 3. Regarding workers who accidentally damage raw materials or finished products due to mechanical failure, the factory should force compensation, both labor and management should follow the provisions of Article 19 of the factory rules and regulations. 4. Regarding the factory's practice of providing uniforms to workers who arrive at the factory on time at the start of work, which is now abolished, if the factory has this practice, it should continue to follow the practice. (C) Regarding the request for the factory to fulfill the agreed-upon conditions, 1. Regarding the request for the factory to abide by the conditions agreed upon by both parties in 1927, both labor and management should abide by these conditions. 2. Regarding the request for the factory to immediately abolish the harsh conditions, each condition has been explained. 3. Regarding the change from jacquard looms to plain looms, if a weaver resigns, the loom must still be assigned to a jacquard loom apprentice and not to an apprentice from another department, this request conflicts with the factory's administrative power and workers must not interfere. 4. Regarding the working hours for miscellaneous workers during each holiday, if the leave is less than one-quarter of a day, it should not be considered leave and the wage increase should not be deducted, this request conflicts with Article 5 of the labor-management agreement for the industry (workers who do not stop working within half a month will receive a wage increase for one day) and should not be discussed. The above explanations have also been instructed to the factory for compliance. The disputes may be resolved soon.</p>
<h3>Yet Another Who Sells Property to Aid Relief</h3>
<p>Previously, the benevolent recluse Bai Kong居士 generously donated a large amount of property to aid relief, which was already reported in this newspaper. Now, another person claiming to be a "Netherworld Servant" 淨土侍者, recognizing that Zhang Junxian 張君賢 of the Jishi Society 濟生會, at this time of local unrest with brigands everywhere, when the old crops are gone and the new ones have not yet come in, and there is a lack of seeds, is braving hardship and selflessly vowing to travel thousands of miles by sea to Tianjin, then around Ping and into Shaanxi, to distribute spring relief and seed relief. He departed on the 21st of the fourth month. This so-called Servant, with an unbearable heart and intent on thoroughly rescuing people, will sell his primary business property and donate the proceeds, amounting to 5,000 yuan, to the Society's relief fund. With this opportunity, the Society's relief efforts can grow daily. The Society has heard of donations of property for relief over the years, but now, with Bai Kong居士 leading the way and this Servant following, it is all because of the scale of the disaster in the provinces and the courage of the Society's Zhang Junxian 張君's vow, which has moved people's hearts. If such good deeds continue to grow, and philanthropists across the country constantly make great vows, then the disaster victims hanging by a thread may be spared from filling ditches, thereby possibly averting a great calamity.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang and the Boy Scouts - Wan Yuan 萬淵</h3>
<p>For this National Boy Scout General Review and Great Jamboree. Chairman Chiang to it. Because it can show the spirit of new youth under party rule. Therefore, promoting it does not spare any effort. To go to Hankou. Is also because of repeatedly postponing it these few days. The welcoming banquet. There is hardly a day.

<h3>Talking About Mushrooms - Bing Xin 冰心</h3>
<p>The mushroom is also known as the fungus. There are many types. Mostly grow in sandy soil. There are also those that grow on trees, called 檽. Its names are even more named according to its shape, such as 馗廚, rosary beads, nail heads, goose palms, etc. People in the past have already had mushroom catalogs that are very detailed. I will not repeat the means of copying and occupy space. Let me talk about two recent events about mushrooms. Speak for both sanitation habit families. Bing Xin 冰心 had an old servant surnamed Ren 任, who lived in Suzhou. He was very filial to his mother. Married a wife surnamed Xue 薛. A peasant girl from near the Erquan Pavilion 二泉亭. She can also fulfill the way of a woman. Mother loves mushrooms. Every spring. Xue 薛 will make several cans of mushroom oil. In order to supply the sweet. The little sister-in-law, A-Yu 阿玉, is only twelve years old. There is also no quarrel with the sister-in-law. Recently, the woman's family had a celebration. Xue 薛 returned to her home. The mother also took her little daughter to congratulate her. Take the Huishan 惠山 tour along the way. And when the event is over and returned to Suzhou. Just got off the bus. Mother vomited a lot. Helped her back home. Neighbors asked. Mother groaned and said. I ate a plate of mushrooms at the Huishanbang 惠山浜 Hotel this morning. The color is red and dark. I was suspicious of it. But the woman said it was okay. I don't know if this thing is causing trouble. The neighbors echoed in unison. It is said that the red mushrooms. Contains toxic quality. Doctors came. And people said the same thing. And there are also dangerous words. The son of Ren 任 blamed the woman for being careless. Xue 薛 had no color on her face. No defense. Fortunately, A-Yu 阿玉, although young. Able to eliminate public opinion. I also said that I also eat a lot. Why not poisoned. The crowds quieted down a bit. The mother also had a strong fever and sweat for a day and night and was relieved. It was caused by the stagnation of spring cold. However, in the middle of the night, A-Yu 阿玉 shouted loudly. Everyone was surprised to see that the woman had already invested in Huans. Just entered the set. Fortunately, A-Yu 阿玉 moved to the sister-in-law's room to sleep because her mother was sick. Got up in the night to change clothes. See and save. Bing Xin 按 按 Wuxi produces many kinds of mushrooms. And the taste of pig blood mushrooms is especially beautiful and non-toxic. I once went to the restaurant at the foot of the mountain. From the division of cooking. Eat with wine friends. There is no suffering. And the servant's wife is almost martyred. This is one thing. The servant also said. When the mother was seriously ill. The neighbor woman, Niu 鈕, said. Last spring, there was a Xiangcheng 鎭 in the Suzhou countryside. An old man used fresh bamboo shoots and fresh mushrooms to cook noodles for drinking. Noon is drunk and full. Died at night. After death, the left cheek was blue and black. The family grieved. Pour the remaining bamboo shoots and mushrooms into the dog. The dog is okay. Also give it to the beggar. The beggar is also okay. However, the old man was healthy and had no illness. Slept and died. There is no disease. Don't return to prison on mushrooms. Where else will you return. This is another thing.

<p>I read two paragraphs of the "Free Talk" in your newspaper by Zheng Yimei 鄭逸梅 and Xu Fan 胥梵, both gentleman. Recorded about the sportsman Mr. Wei Xudong 魏旭東. The two gentlemen used a flexible and heavenly pen. To write about Mr. Wei's peerless and amazing skills. So that those who have never seen Mr. Wei's unique skills in the world. As if seeing Mr. leap, jump and show a good skill. It can be said that they complement each other. It is a pity that the bad news was falsely transmitted. Make those who love Mr. suddenly mourn Mr. The gang must be corrected. Let him know that Mr. is still alive. Mr. Shi lived in Jintan Village 金灘村, Longzhong Town 隆中鎭, Shaoyang, Hunan. The same village closed with Yu. And belong to the in-laws. Therefore, Mr. knows more about the boy. Until now, the old people talked about his story. Nothing but tongue surprise. Mr. Jia is under the Lion Mountain 獅子山 in Jintan Village 金灘村. Facing the Elephant Mouth Mountain across the river. There is a long bridge that connects it. The bridge is made of stone. More than ten feet high. One day Mr. You was on the bridge. The children surrounded him. Firmly request to try his talent. A seller of plum approached and said. (If you can jump down from the bridge. Jump up again. You should hold all the Li to Xiang Jun.) Mr. laughed. Slowly tie up the skirt. Jumped down. Standing on the sandbar. After that, he flew up. Has been on the bridge edge. Not panting. Not a few red faces. The body is light and agile. As straight as apes and monkeys. The children cheered. Fight to taste Mr. Mr. laughed and said to them. (Am I greedy for Li? Just return all of them. But remember. From now on, don't despise the scholars of the world.) He has also lived in a high-rise building. From time to time, I went out for things. Without waiting for the door to open. And Mr. has been lying on the building. So the villagers are even more surprised. Mr. Li made meritorious service in the late Qing Guangxu years. Admiring the Tiger Hill Lingyan 勝 victory. Stayed in Wuzhong to take charge of teaching. For more than 20 years, he has never returned to the village. Although familiar with Mr.'s great name. But there is no chance to see him.</p>
<p>In the winter of the sixteenth year, Yu Yizhu. Mr. Accidental Illness. Bring your family to Han. I got to see you one day. The next day, Mr. returned to his hometown. Yu also has something to do with the East Tour. So I said goodbye in a hurry. There is a village who came from his hometown later. Asked about Mr. for things sullen in the chest. Juheng is not happy. Groaning between the couches. But those who can't get up and sit down. It has been more than a year since the world cherished it. Recently, I came to visit Kyoto for things. Staying at the Zeng House of the Hunan Yinyu Shantang in the Huapai Building and Kexiang. Mr. also came to visit friends. After seeing it at first sight, I was full of surprise and joy. Observe Mr.'s face carefully. Clean and plump. No disease at all. Talk to Mr. Chao every day. The mouth is eloquent. Inquired about what Mr. Xu Fan Xu said. Can't help but laugh wildly. I would like to record it again. To tell the two gentlemen. And to comfort those in the world who love Mr. Let him know that Mr. is still alive.</p>
<h3>A Record of Li Jirui's Grand Bi Fate - Da. Huang.</h3>
<p>The play "Hong Bi Yuan" (Grand Bi Fate) was arranged by Li Jirui 李吉瑞. Later, it was plagiarized by Lv Yueqiao 呂月樵 to Shanghai. It was performed on the Grand Stage. The results were not weak. Therefore, it was continued to sixteen copies. Even women and children do not know the story of Luo Hongxun 駱宏勛 and Hua Bilan 花碧蘭. However, its essence is concentrated in the first book. And the tightness of Li Jirui's original structure. And the elegance of the words. It is not comparable to the first book of Lv Yueqiao 改呂 Yueqiao's facelift. This time Li Ling came to Shanghai. For fear of the loss of the original book. Especially replay it on the Shanghai stage. Yu (I) thought that the original book of this play must be watched. And Li is already sixty years old. There is also no intention to step on the stage again. There is no day to come again. Then steal half a day's free time. Go to a view. When I arrived, there was no space in the pool. Fortunately, I had a seat in the third row. Otherwise, there is almost no seat to get. At that time, Hong Bi Yuan happened to be in the stadium. Li's Luo Hongxun 駱宏勛. Although the dress is similar, he is old and inferior to the people in the book. But its dignified and luxurious attitude. The Huangzhong Dalu Huangzhong Dalu's noise. Then one by one can bring the personality of Luo Hongxun 駱宏勛. Give full play without redundancy. The style is stylish. The singing is clean. Da Wu is agile. It is also its remaining affairs. It is not comparable to the general wild fox Zen's Luo Hongxun 駱宏勛. There is a feeling in my heart. Because of the record.</p>
<h3>Visiting Hualong Chinese Medicine Hospital - Wang. Tian. Hen.</h3>
<p>There are countless Western hospitals in Shanghai. There are very few Chinese medicine hospitals. And silently observe the patient's psychology. There are more people who trust Chinese medicine than those who trust Western medicine. This is undeniable. However, although there are many Chinese medicine practitioners in Shanghai. And those who have true academics. Those who have gone deep into Qihuang Tang 奥 are few and far between. For diagnosis, no matter whether it is good or bad. All are more expensive than in the Mainland. The drug value is also the same. Almost several times more than in the Mainland. Therefore, citizens cannot get sick. Poor and lowly servants, let alone. That is, in the home of Zhongren. One day of medicine. Always not four or five gold to ten gold. Apart from the usual wind and cold, there is also a slight illness. It is not possible to be Horan in one or two days. As soon as the salary is gone. How can there be such a huge storage. Those who are slowly treated. Mr. Ding Jiwan 丁濟萬. The descendant of the famous doctor Mr. Ding Ganren 丁甘仁. Family learning is a source. The Xinglin Xinglin looks heavy. Recently, I have learned from this. Founded Hualong Chinese Medicine Hospital. I was invited to visit a short time ago. The hospital is located on Huagenio Road 華格臬路 in the French Concession. The location is not a noisy city with fresh air. Opened several wards. The equipment is like a Western hospital. There is too much. And the treatment is purely Chinese. The doctors who respond to the diagnosis. Wei Cheng Menxue 程門雪, Liu Zuotong 劉佐彤, Ma Shoumin 馬壽民, Tong Shaobo 童少伯, Qin Hanmin 秦漢民, Zhao Baiyu 趙百渝, Zhang Jianqiu 張劍秋. All are famous doctors in Shanghai. Jiwan is one of them. Its biggest feature. It is to treat Hansu preferentially. (In fact, the hospital is designed for Hansu). All patients seek medical treatment. Only pay a small ocean of two corners. The procedure is extremely simple. The red poor and those who give medicine do not count the value. The above-mentioned doctors. Their diagnosis is indeed not cheap. Ordinary Hansu. There is almost a retreat at Wangmen. Those who dare not ask Jin. Now it is gathered in one hall. Prepare the two corners of the micro-funds. You can ask for medical treatment. The citizens have this. It is not as good as getting a safety guarantee on hygiene issues. What is its Jiahui. According to Jiwan's words. All the doctors are Dunpin and come. Purely exhaust the obligation. The diagnosis fee is two corners. It is not enough to offset the cost of Shiyi. At the beginning of the founding. That is, consider that it cannot last for a long time. Therefore, the value of the first and second class wards is slightly increased. In order to contribute to the injection cloud.</p>
<p>Letter: Recently, I read a wonderful rat-catching drug in "Free Talk". This method is copied from the magic book. Originally named (White Day Gathering Rats.) Now it is said to take advantage of the quiet night. Light the fire and burn it. And be sure to close the windows tightly. Shu Xiangqi does not leak outside. To be able to work wonders. Check (Nao Yanghua 閙楊花) is a narcotic poisonous drug. I am afraid of people who sleep and lie down. I smelled a little bit of the air. I have already been unaware of personnel. Wait until dawn. People and rats are sleeping peacefully and not awake. Because in the end there is (home dwellers may try it), one or two words. Or afraid of not knowing its medicinal properties. Rashly try it. The harm is not shallow. I hope to publish this letter in the newspaper. Borrowing to correct its mistakes. Le Nong respectfully opens.</p>
<h3>Bird Burial Sheng</h3>
<p>I don't know when the custom of bird burial started. Only Nan Shi Funan Guochuan Nan Shi 扶南國傳 said. The national custom of the dead has four funerals. Water burial is to throw it into the river. Cremation is to burn it to ashes. Earth burial is to bury it. Bird burial is to discard it in the middle of the field. According to Funan Kingdom. That is today's Siam. However, the custom of bird burial. Is it only available overseas? I don't think the Hulunbuir Buhate Hulunbuir 布哈特 etc. outside the Guanwai Guanwai. Until now, there is still the legacy of bird burial.</p>
<p>I have a friend. Living in the Northeast for almost five years. Occasional letters and Hulunbuir Buhate bird burials. I will take the essentials as follows. Hulunbuir Buhate places. People died advocating bird burial. The law is to tie the corpse to a tree branch in the field. Let the birds compete for it. Although its shape is equal to Lingchi. But it is not considered cruel. Saying it is not as good as it. Then the soul after death. There is no way to ascend to heaven.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (1) (7) (9) Bao. Tian. Xiao.</h3>
<p>Episode 10 Chiyan Tengtian Gulanzixiao Nu Hong Chuxu Tie Di Ji Xi Wu Mingling</p>
<p>The fiancée appointed by Liu Xingshu 柳星叔 is the eldest lady of the Fang family in Wuxing 吳興. That Fang family in Wuxing 吳興 is a large family. They have several houses. They are all in the prosperous era. The previous generation of people. There are those who are abroad as ministers. There are those who are domestic as high-ranking officials. There are those who are broad servants in Beijing. There are those who are general managers in Hankou. That is, the children of the next generation. There are also those who go abroad to study abroad. University students are university students. Bank key positions are bank key positions. High gate family. There are many children. Chinese people have always believed in the big family system. For example, if there are five brothers. Occasionally, the old grandfather and the old lady are in the hall. They cannot be separated as usual. If these five houses also have five sons per house. It is twenty-five grandchildren. Marrying a granddaughter-in-law again. That can also be regarded as a lot of people in a family. In ancient China, it was a good talk to live together in five generations. They are all promoting the big family system. That Wuxing Fang House 吳興方宅 is also a model of a big family. I am now very happy to say to Zuo Shichen 柳星叔 that day. My marriage. It can probably be achieved. I didn't want an old classmate. Now I am doing my father-in-law. Shichen said. How do you say that. Xingshu said. My fiancée now. Yi's father, Fang Xiangqing 方湘青, is my old classmate in the United States. However, he studied law. I am studying economics. He returned to China two years earlier than me. In terms of age, he is also five or six years older than me. We are used to joking in the United States. Among the classmates, there are also those who know that he has a beautiful daughter. Everyone also laughs at him. Now it's really done to my father-in-law. I can't help but feel embarrassed. Zuo Shichen said. In the current era, it doesn't matter at all. Moreover, he is your classmate. After all, he returned to China two years earlier than you. Isn't it your old senior. It is just right to use the old senior as the father-in-law. I think your fiancée must be a show outside of the wise. Have you seen it? Xingshu said. Speaking of which, we and the Fang family. It also closes a little bit of old relatives. His lady. She studies in the Chinese and Western Girls' School 中西女學校. It is said that people are very smart. Everything English music is not bad. People are also very beautiful. We were in the United States. Just know he has this lady. When I returned to China, I saw it a few times. But in terms of the family. I think it's a big mistake. Their Fang family is the giant valve of Wuxing 吳興. We are a cold scholar family. My father is an old scholar. Although later changed to business. However, in the end, he did not get rid of the bookish nature. It's not like the Shanghai class who specialize in speculation. As for me. Just doing things in society. And what is used is not what is learned. I don't have any savings myself. Nor can I bother our old man because of my own marriage. Moreover, he has already said that he does not have much strength. Promised to subsidize me one thousand yuan.</p>

<h3>Finance Gold Price After a Brief Rebound</h3>
<p>Returned to a Weak Market</p>
<p>Unpredictable Fluctuations: Yesterday, the gold market situation showed a slight decline, with occasional ups and downs. The morning session saw a fluctuation of only one or two taels and five qian. The afternoon session hovered around 500 taels, fluctuating by about two taels. Foreign exchange seemed to weaken, and dealers were confused. Companies like Yu Da Yuan Mao Yong were mostly buying, while Zhi Feng Yong Wan Xing Shun Li were mostly selling. The market price, based on the Dong Hui settlement price, had already been reduced by more than eleven taels. The morning session showed a slight upward trend because of the reduction in large silver bars, which later led to higher prices. In the afternoon, various firms bought and sold intermittently. Initially, the market was stable, but after rumors of a factory strike in Japan, everyone rushed to sell, revealing a sign of weakness. The 500-tael mark was suddenly broken because exchange rates were trending lower. Forward Japanese gold could be sold for only 1.04 taels. The final buyers rallied slightly, pushing the price back up to 1 tael, and it again exceeded the 500-tael mark. The recent spot price of silver bars in London has decreased by 0.1875, and the forward price by 0.25, reducing the silver price by 0.375.</p>
<p>The opening high for June gold was 501 taels and 8 qian, an increase of 8 qian and 1 mao, with mutual fluctuations of 8 or 9 qian, ranging from 500 taels and 0.06 qian to 1 tael and 3.4 qian, because of differing buying and selling activities and a non-tight foreign exchange market. July gold was quoted at 11 pence and 0.3125, with transactions possible at both prices. As soon as the announcement was made, it fell to 501 taels, with no price movement. Subsequently, there were fluctuations of 4 or 5 qian, ranging from 500 taels and 0.05 qian to 1 tael. The internal market seemed weak. Various banks were doing deals on July Citibank at $47.25, and China banks were selling June English gold at 11 pence and 0.25. On the floor, Shun Li Wan Xing and others were actively selling, causing a decline of 6 or 7 qian to 500 taels and 0.02 qian by 10:30 am. Then, short sellers took advantage of the situation to advance, but with little buying and selling of various exchange rates, the gold price steadily rose, exceeding 1 tael after 11 am, and jumping to 1 tael and 8 qian after 11:30 am. Later, it slightly decreased by 3 or 4 qian. At noon, the closing price was 501 taels and 6 qian.</p>
<p>Rumors Suppressed: The afternoon session opened at 501 taels and 3 qian. Suddenly, news of a factory strike was heard, and people's confidence faltered, causing the market to fluctuate suddenly. Everyone was selling, and the 500-tael mark was abruptly broken, falling from 501 taels and a half to 499 taels and 3 qian. Exchange rates also weakened, and some firms were selling. Sumitomo bought August Japanese gold at 1.04 taels. HSBC and Guangdong were doing deals on May American gold at $47.0625. After 2:15 pm, buyers increased, and the market stabilized, rising by more than 1 tael, with only a few qian of fluctuation. Around 4 pm, it rose to 500 taels and 0.07 qian. Banks were doing deals on May English gold at 11 pence and 0.1875. Retail sales then pushed the price back down to 500 taels. At the 4:30 pm closing, it was 500 taels and 0.02 qian, a decrease of 8 qian compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Supply Seems to Exceed Demand: The highest price for the day was 501 taels and 8 qian, and the lowest price was 499 taels and 3 qian, a difference of 2 taels and a half. The quoted price was still 511 taels and 8 qian, a decrease of 11 taels to 10 taels. The afternoon price was still reduced by 11 to 12 taels. The registered prices were 505 taels for May, 502 taels for June, a water supplement of 0.05 taels in the afternoon and 0.03 taels. The commodity prices were the same in the morning and afternoon at 1 tael and 6 qian, and the closing price was 0.02 qian. Trading firms included Yu Quan Fu Xing Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Heng Xing, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Tai, etc., which were buying, and Shun Li, Wan Xing, Zhi Feng Yong, Chun Yuan Yong, Tai Heng Yuan, etc., which were selling. In the afternoon, Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Chang, Wan Xing, Shun Li, Zhi Feng Yong, etc., were entering and exiting intermittently. Heng Xing, Sen Chang Yong, Yuan Tai, and retailers were selling. The Dalian group had a supply exceeding demand, issuing more than 3,000 bars and taking in more than 1,000 bars. Currently, the bulls and bears are balanced. The Guangdong group seemed to be engaged in scalping, entering and exiting frequently.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Weakens Domestically</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, and Indian silver markets all trended lower. Yokohama Japanese and American rates remained unchanged. British and Japanese rates declined. The Kobe exchange rate remained unchanged. HSBC's listed exchange rates were no different from those after the changes of the previous day. As for the domestic rates of British, American, and Japanese currencies, they were all normal, but seemed to show a weakening trend. The gold market also showed signs of softening, hovering around 500 taels. Chinese speculators and gold firms were selling slightly. Japanese exchange was being purchased slightly. Although banks were taking in British and American exchange, their appetite was not strong. About 30,000 to 40,000 pounds of British gold were sold by Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank, while Chase Bank made slight purchases. Banks were also mutually dealing 30,000 to 40,000 pounds, and also $200,000 of American gold. Chinese firms settled $100,000, and Yokohama Specie Bank sold it. Several hundred thousand dollars of Japanese gold were sold off, and Mitsui, Taiwan, and Sumitomo absorbed it, with very few settlements. The Dalian group sold several hundred thousand dollars of Dalian drafts to collect bars, which Mitsui bought. The afternoon result was that the premium was 0.0625 higher than the previous day's, and the American dollar was 0.125 higher, but the forward rate was break-even. There were also some increases and decreases in Japanese gold, and the market atmosphere was flat.</p>
<h3>British and American Silver Prices Decline Sharply</h3>
<p>According to London dispatches yesterday, silver bars have all fallen back. The spot price fell by 0.1875 to 19 pence 0.625 (equivalent to 1 shilling and 11 pence and 0.1875 English gold).

<h3>Foreign Banknote Circulation Continues to Be Smooth</h3>
<p>Current Market Overview: The uses of foreign banknotes currently involve several aspects of strong demand, such as tea cocoons, miscellaneous grains, and military supplies, all involving enormous sums of several hundred thousand. Therefore, circulation is smooth and the market atmosphere is exceptionally prosperous. Moreover, with the end of the month approaching, securities settlements are not far off, so the trend is especially favorable. However, currently, besides silver dollars, banknotes still account for a large portion, so there is no need to worry about insufficient supply, and the price will naturally not need to be raised wildly. The money market generally has a long-term shortage appearance, which embellishes the market situation. However, with more inflows than outflows, the result is a surfeit in the market, so the silver discount has no chance to soar.</p>
<p>Discount Prices (Foreign Cents): The morning discount remained at 7 qian and 2 fen and 2, matching the previous day. People's minds were mostly calm. The afternoon market suddenly became brisk, and the closing price was raised by 2 hao and a half to 7 qian and 2 fen and 2 li and a half. (Silver Discounts) The relaxation of the money market has been long-standing. Currently, during the long-term period of congested inflows and outflows, outflows are numerous, so the silver discount has no chance to turn around. Yesterday, the morning and afternoon rates remained at 4 fen, and the break was 2 fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Situation: Since someone suddenly absorbed Jiangnan small coins the day before yesterday, causing prices to rise wildly, the afternoon market once leveled off. Yesterday, it was very quiet, with only 1,500 jiao traded in the morning and 1,000 jiao in the afternoon, and the market price returned to its original state of 6 qian and 2 fen and 7 li and a half, the same in the morning and afternoon. Guangdong small coins were 5 qian and 9 fen and 9 li and 2 hao and a half in the morning, and 5 qian and 9 fen and 9 li and a half in the afternoon. Transactions were 120,000 jiao in the morning and 75,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins suddenly fell sharply by 5,000 wen to 388,000 wen. The reason for the decline is unknown.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflows and Outflows (Silver Funds): Yesterday, banks' inflows and outflows were generally more frequent, only related to the comparative period. The money shops' inflows and outflows were especially busy. The silver public sheet inflows and outflows reached 4,600,000 to 4,700,000, the head of the sheet inflows and outflows totaled more than 5,000,000, and interbank remittance totaled more than 800,000.

Japanese banks' inflows and outflows totaled more than 4,000,000, and warehouse inflows totaled 500,000. (Foreign Funds) Remittances and drafts totaled 980,000 in the morning and 995,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes totaled 5,000 in the morning and 10,000 in the afternoon. Outside the market, banknotes totaled 155,000 in the morning and 135,000 in the afternoon. Silver dollars totaled 270,000 in the morning and 165,000 in the afternoon. New currency totaled 105,000 in both markets. Bank transactions totaled 750,000 in the morning and 950,000 in the afternoon. Foreign banks' current account collections and disbursements totaled more than 1,200,000, and banknote inflows and outflows totaled more than 2,000,000. Money shops' foreign public sheet collections and disbursements were numerous due to the comparative period, totaling more than 8,000,000. Foreign head of sheet collections and disbursements totaled 3,100,000, and borrowing and lending of foreign funds totaled 1,800,000. Small money shop transactions totaled 700,000 to 800,000.

<p>The long-term amount released by Ningbo banks in Shanghai totaled no less than 20,000,000. This year, because the market is not good, they have taken back a small portion and switched to collecting cocoons. All major silk factories in Shanghai have undertaken sales, and inland silk factories have also absorbed a large batch. Yesterday, about 2,000,000 was released, and the interest rate was roughly the same as that released by banks. It is also reported that it will continue today and tomorrow. It is said that the release amount is as high as 5,000,000 to 6,000,000.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Prices Rebounded in Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram reported that Sanpin yarn had fallen by 23 yuan. The local yarn market was in a state of unease due to the tram strike and rumors in the business community. The market was firm, but the major buyers and sellers remained calm and took no action. The sales of current yarn were relatively smooth. The yarn market remains in a chaotic state.</p>
<p>Futures Yarn Fell in the Morning, Rose in the Afternoon: The opening situation in the morning market was flat, and there was a lack of trading. The delivery volume in the current month was sufficient, so the market was very weak, falling by 4 qian, while the distant month only fell by 1 qian. In the afternoon, the tram strike intensified and rumors continued to spread. At the same time, sales by the Sichuan group were good, and buying interest in the market was strong. All months rose by 2, 3, 4, and 5 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,450 bales. The closing prices for the market are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The Sichuan group has the strongest appetite for current sales, and yarn sales are still good. Yesterday, various groups bought 2,360 bales, and companies in the same industry bought 1,210 bales. Market conditions were slightly firmer. Customers in Sichuan bought the most, with 1,350 bales. In addition, 125 bales were bought inland, 305 bales in Jiangxi, 75 bales in Shantou, 50 bales in Nanyang, 80 bales in Guangdong, 120 bales in Jinan, 200 bales in Niuzhuang, 25 bales in Qingdao, 30 bales in Fujian, and 500 to 600 bales were opened by factories.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Hit by Rumors</h3>
<p>Retail Sales Result in a Slack Situation</p>
<p>The cotton market is calm, and the situation is slightly relaxed. However, foreign cotton prices are still rising in the near month, while local sentiment is softening. This is because the environment is not good and there are many rumors about yarn factories, so retailers are selling to prepare for a rainy day. However, the Han group has a firm attitude and does not want to let go.</p>
<p>Distant Han Standard Trend to Soften: The Han standard opened in the morning market, and prices rose with the firmness of American cotton. The current month rose by 1.5 qian, and the distant month was flat. In the afternoon, the current month rose by another 5 fen, while the distant month fell by 1 or 2 qian due to the influence of rumors. The total transaction volume for the day was 49,600 dan. The closing prices for the Han standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Raw Cotton Atmosphere Remains Depressed: The current cotton business is still deserted. The factories' buying interest is very weak. The source is about 200 bales of Tonghua cotton. The sales records are listed on the left. Shaanxi Cotton 36.75 Pu Yi Factory bought 200 pieces. Spot goods delivered to the factory. Shaanxi Cotton 36.75 Yong Yu Factory bought 200 pieces. Spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>
<h3>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Fall More Than Rise</h3>
<p>American Cotton Old Rose, New Fall: Yesterday, American cotton was firm at first because spot traders were buying and short sellers were covering. Later, it weakened because some longs had to close out positions. Old cotton rose by 11 to 20 points, and new cotton rose and fell by 1 to 4 points. Spot goods rose by 20 points. English cotton futures rose by 16 to 18 points, and spot goods rose by 22 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 10 points. Indian cotton was firm due to the rise in American cotton and the market's inclination to buy. The near and distant months of Ping Gu Er and Ao Mu La both rose by 4 rupees, Bai Luo Xi rose by 5 rupees, and the distant month rose by 6 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left.

<h3>Grains He Xia Rice Market Turns Stable</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, ships arriving from inland were scarce, and sales were flat. The buying interest in North Bang white japonica rice was extremely quiet. The stores needed to pick and choose carefully. Retail sales were also not prosperous. However, the overall market has turned stable, so the inferior grades of japonica rice from previous seasons were more moderate than the previous day. Although there were still some reductions, they were only a few pennies. Overall, the source from the rear is feared to be scarce. There are indeed 150 or so ships stored in He Xia, but the cost of these goods is high, so they are unwilling to sell them off. Currently, common rice is about to be sold, so the japonica rice market is also difficult to improve. The entire situation has presented a picture of long-term stagnation, and it is not easy to rise or fall. Sales of thin rice were brisk in the morning, but the overcast and rainy weather brought quiet in the afternoon. Prices were high and stable. There was very little Yang Du pointed rice on the market, and sales were also quiet due to the scarcity of goods. Prices were firm and stable. White Yuan arrivals were slightly increased, and the outgoing route was still mainly high-priced goods. There was no significant rise or fall in the market.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Arrivals were scarce, and sales in various groups were also very flat. Su Tong Bang machine japonica rice sales were smooth, and prices did not rise or fall. Chang Xi Bang machine japonica rice had a few special sales, and the market atmosphere tended to be firm. The situation here is now in line with the Zhabei side. South Bang Lian Ze and other thin rice customers were dull and unresponsive, and ship arrivals were dismal. The market was stable. Yang Du Xian rice turned from firm to stable because foreign rice prices were loosening and sales were sluggish. Arrivals and sales of Tong Bian were evenly matched, so there was no profit or loss. Yin Yuan rice was selling well to wineries, and the market looked brisk, opening at a high of around 17 and a half yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Initially Firm, Then Fell</h3>
<p>Sales Became Active After the Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation: The opening price in the morning was still firm, but buyers felt it was too high and mostly watched and waited. The market then showed a reaction, and the prices of the small corners declined slightly. Sales improved. The small bags opened at 5,000 bags, priced at 15 yuan, 2 jiao, and a half to 15 yuan, 1 jiao, and a half. The large bags opened at 3,000 bags, priced at 15 yuan, 1 jiao, and a half to 15 yuan, 0 jiao, and 7 fen. No. 1 Saigon opened at 1,000 bags, priced at 16 yuan to 15 yuan, 9 jiao and a half. Min Dang rice opened at 500 bags, priced at 15 yuan, 1 jiao, 2 fen, and 3. Rough rice opened at 4,000 bags, priced at 14 yuan, 8 jiao, 6 fen, and 7. Kalati rough rice opened at 1,000 bags, priced at 14 yuan, 9 jiao, and a half. Road goods had 3,000 large bags, priced at 15 yuan, 1 jiao, and 3, and 2,000 small bags, priced at 15 yuan, 1 jiao, and 8. Futures opened at 500 tons of small bag rough rice for May delivery, priced at 6 taels and 8 qian.</p>
<h3>Distant Futures Powder Tends to be Firm Due to Rain</h3>
<p>Inland Groups Continue to Buy</p>
<p>Yesterday's powder market showed a trend of near weakness and distant firmness. The current month, due to the approach of settlement, many longs were returning and selling. It was also heard that Tianjin groups had opened and shipped 170,000 bags of spot goods, which were sold by Fu Xin for delivery in Tianjin, opening at 2 taels, 6 qian, and 3 fen in Shanghai yuan. Therefore, the standard for the current month was as lonely as usual. As for the distant months, the weather turned bad again, and there was a slight rain. Inland groups continued to gradually buy. Although a certain factory had a few sales, there were more buyers than sellers, and the market price finally tended to look good. The current month is about to pass, and there is no problem to speak of. Distant futures are expected to be good, and it will not be easy to turn flat for a while. Perhaps due to the rain, it is possible to rise another point. As a result, the current month reached a low of 2 taels and 5 qian and 3 fen, down 7 li and a half from the previous day, 5 li and a half for May, and 5 li for each month from June to September.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Near and Distant Both Brisk</h3>
<p>Spot Goods Continue to Open 6,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market turned brisk again. In the current month, because of the receiving side, such as Tai Kang alone, preparing to receive about 50 cars, those unwilling to deliver had to cover, so the situation was relatively tight. From June onwards, because it was raining again, although foreign wheat quotations declined slightly by 2 jiao or 3, sentiment remained firm. Looking at the situation after this, because the inland groups ultimately thought that the rice price was not flat, they kept tightening up, so the outlook is still stable. As a result, the current month was up 2 fen from the previous day, June was up 2 fen, July was unchanged, August was up 1 fen, and September was down 1 fen. The spot wheat market situation is still flat. The two factories, Fu Xin and Fu Feng, were still eager to sell, and the rest had not opened. Suzhou wheat, Xuzhou wheat, Bengbu wheat, and Qingjiangpu wheat were 5 taels and 5 fen, Hankou wheat was 4 taels and 5 qian and a half, and Hunan wheat was 4 taels and 8 qian to 6 qian and 3 fen, totaling 6,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea Pingyao Silkworms Have Already Started Three Sleep Leaf Opening</h3>
<p>Weather Suddenly Cold Suddenly Hot Slightly Affected</p>
<p>In the Pingyao Chang Le Bridge area of Hangzhou, this year, due to the government's additional distribution of improved silkworm seeds and expansion of feeding, the silkworm rearing is not weak. Although the weather was cold during the incubation period, temperature was supplemented with fire, and there was no impact. Currently, the early batches have already started opening leaves after three sleeps for many days. However, in recent days, there have been continuous overcast and rainy days, coupled with the sudden cold and hot weather, which has caused the silkworms to not wake up from their sleep. There are occasional cases of diarrhea and black water due to the silkworms wetting the leaves. The price of leaves is currently opening at 2 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<h3>Both Futures and Spot Silk Markets Lack Vitality</h3>
<p>New Cocoon Factories See Little Inquiry ··· European Telegrams for Spot Silk Still Unresponsive</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign silk market, both futures and spot goods lacked vitality. New cocoon factories, in past years before the new cocoons entered the market, would have sold several thousand bales. This year, besides American firms selling a few hundred bales of medium-grade goods, the rest are observing cautiously. Telegrams from overseas for spot silk are also rarely seen turning the market around. The market atmosphere is calm, and prices tend towards weakness. Yesterday, no transactions were made in either futures or spot goods.</p>
<h3>News of New Tea from Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Wenzhou Green Flower Tea Already Weighed and Priced　In Wenzhou, tea farmers have recently begun picking tea leaves. Many tea factories have already started weighing and pricing. According to news from Wenzhou yesterday, the first batches have been released, selling for thirty-four yuan per dan. Tea of lesser quality is also selling for twenty-eight or twenty-nine yuan per dan. There is little difference compared to last year, but this year's harvest is poor and buyers' demand is strong, so tea prices are expected to rise.</p>
<p>The Huzhou Tea Market is Very Lively　Local tea firms that have been dealing in Huzhou tea in recent years have been quite successful. Therefore, local tea merchants are paying great attention to Huzhou tea this year. Previously, due to the rampant banditry in the Si'an area, tea merchants dared not go there. Now that the situation there has eased, various tea factories have sent personnel with funds to the mountains to purchase tea. Various tea vendors are also gathering there, making the market very lively. Mountain farmers have started picking since the 22nd, but because of the strong demand from buyers, the market price is not expected to be low when weighing and pricing begins.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market　Thai Yuan Rock Sugar Scarce and Popular</h3>
<p>Coarse Granulated White Sugar Gradually Declines</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received telegrams from producing areas. The price of Cuban spot sugar was 1.625, a decrease of 0.03125 compared to the previous telegram. New York sugar futures for May were 1.59, up one point; September was 1.69, down two points; December was 1.78, down three points; and March of next year was 1.87, also down one point. The prices of Javanese sugar futures and spot sugar remained unchanged. The market for coarse granulated white sugar from the guild was very weak, with sluggish buying interest. The asking price was 7 liang, 2 qian, 2 fen, and 5 li, with few inquiries. Later, a small amount was traded at 7 liang, 2 qian, but the market remained weak. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was 7 liang and 2 fen and 5 li, also rarely sought after. Transactions for Japanese sugar were also scarce. N mark was 7 liang and 7 qian, and YT mark was 7 liang, 5 qian, and 7 fen and 5 li. The market was also flat and weak. Stocks of domestic Thai Yuan rock sugar continue to be released, and supplies are already depleted. The market atmosphere has turned lively, and asking prices have already been seen to increase. However, the market for unified rock sugar has substantial stocks, and the market is relatively flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods　Kai Shui Mei Raincoat Fabric Continues to Rise by Two Qian</h3>
<p>Raincoat fabric sells best in late spring. After the market opened this spring, prices have risen frequently, already reaching 4 or 5 qian per yard. Recently, due to the small amount of goods remaining in stock among dealers, the selling price has increased by another 2 qian. It is not easy to purchase original cases, and there is a risk of stockouts. Yesterday, all brands were selling for 3 liang and 8 qian, compared to the price of 2 liang and 8 or 9 qian last December, a difference of almost 1 liang.</p>
<h3>Hardware　Coarse Lead Wire Rises Sharply and Unceasingly</h3>
<p>Recently, the military has been purchasing a large quantity of No. 12 and No. 14 lead wire, resulting in a shortage of market goods. Supply cannot meet demand, and the standard price is rising steadily. Although dealers are actively purchasing from overseas, it is difficult to transport goods in time due to the small quantity and high market prices. Therefore, local dealers are increasingly bullish, and selling prices are rising sharply. Currently, No. 12 is selling for 9 liang per dan, and No. 14 is 9 liang and 5 qian, both higher than the previous market by 3 or 4 qian.</p>

<h3>Customs of the Indigenous People of Borneo</h3>
<p>On the wave-swept shores of Borneo live several savage tribes. These tribes, even now, remain in a primitive state, living with wild beasts in the deep mountains, almost isolated from the modern world. They live in simple shelters, moving every year with the changing farms. They wear very little, using only a piece of bark more than a丈 long to wrap tightly around their lower bodies. However, the women wear a little more. As for food, besides hunted mountain birds and beasts and fish, they eat leaves that grow year-round. Because the land is very rich and their desires are not high, they can live every day without worry. This is probably the reason why they do not progress. Speaking of their customs, they are even more covered with a very rich primitive color. All kinds of things not easily seen and heard in the world are still preserved in their folklore. Now I will describe a few of the more interesting ones to get a glimpse of the general nature of their customs.</p>
<p>Listening to Bird Sounds</p>
<p>Among the local indigenous people, there is a very strange custom of listening to bird sounds. Whenever they go out, whether on land or water, they pay very close attention to the sounds of birds. From the melodious chirping, they can distinguish the good or bad fortune of the trip. This superstition has a very deep impact on their minds. Therefore, if they hear unfavorable bird sounds on the way, they would rather abandon all their efforts and turn back home. From this phenomenon, we can think of their worship of birds.</p>
<p>However, the bird sounds they listen to are not indiscriminate, nor are they listened to randomly. For example, the direction of the bird's call, the pitch of the call, all of these are related. If I were to explain this in detail, it would be very interesting, but unfortunately, I am not very familiar with it, so I will have to leave it out for now.</p>
<p>Because they worship birds, they have a feeling of not daring to harm birds. If, at any time, a bird they worship flies to the treetops in front of or behind their house and chirps all day and night, they become uneasy and rush to take some cakes and fruits to the tree to offer and pray. They believe that by doing this, they can not only avoid the arrival of disaster but also gain good fortune.</p>
<p>Their custom of listening to bird sounds, I think, is nothing more than that caused by the kind of heart that worships nature.</p>
<p>Poison Fish Festival</p>
<p>Every year in June and July, the weather is very dry, and the water in the river gradually recedes. At this time, they have the Poison Fish Festival. Before the festival, the nearby residents share the responsibility of collecting fish vines. The so-called fish vine is a kind of vine plant that contains poison. Extracting its juice can make fish dizzy and float to the surface as if dead, allowing people to seize them. When this kind of fish vine is collected to a considerable extent, and the river water has receded very shallowly, they jointly decide on a date. Once the date is set, everyone is almost joyful, hoping that day will come soon. In this atmosphere of joy, they must also busy themselves preparing various spears. Those who are more particular will paint the ends of the spear shafts with various colors, or tie a few small bells, so that they ring when thrown. In addition, they have to spend several days working to fence off the shallower parts of the river with wooden stakes, with a large cage placed in the middle. This is to prevent the fish from swimming underwater after eating the fish vine.</p>
<p>On the day of the festival, no matter how far away people live, they row medium-sized boats with three or four people in each boat towards the place where the festival is held. Usually, people from far away arrive the day before and spend the night on the sandbar. The next day, when the morning light is faint, everyone prepares to set off, laughing and talking, a kind of ecstasy inspiring everyone's hearts. Once the order to set off is given, everyone throws the fish vine water into the river together and then traces downstream. At this time, everyone holds a spear in their right hand, waiting for the fish to float to the surface. Therefore, speaking of how many fish are caught, half depends on chance and half depends on the technique of throwing. They hunt like this until dusk, and then they return home, slightly satisfied with the few fish they have speared.</p>
<p>Collecting Ancient Jars</p>
<p>They are born with a fondness for ancient jars, so once they have savings, they try to buy ancient jars. The value of an ancient jar is about ten yuan for cheap ones, but as high as several thousand yuan for expensive ones. People who collect ancient jars are always wealthy and powerful, such as the village leaders.</p>
<p>These people who collect ancient jars seem to have the vanity of flaunting their status. For example, whenever there is a banquet, they decorate the ancient jars they treasure with red cloth and display them at the banquet for guests to appreciate. On the part of the host, they naturally feel a rare sense of pride, and on the part of the guests, they naturally cannot avoid admiring and envying them.</p>
<h3>Economic Circles of Various Countries Transitioning from Prosperity to Decline</h3>
<p>Increased Ship Layups in Britain Hit Particularly Hard</p>
<p>Recently, the shipping industry in various countries has been sluggish, with ships being laid up one after another. Britain, known as a maritime nation, has been hit the hardest. According to news from a certain source, the number of ships laid up in the main commercial ports of mainland Britain (now Ireland) is as follows:</p>
<p>Total　British Ships over 1,000 Tons</p>
<p>January 1, 1929　3.971　279　326</p>
<p>October 11　385　997　246.24</p>
<p>January 1, 1930　352,699　327,387</p>
<p>That is, on January 1 of this year, there was an increase of 22,888 tons (6.94%) compared to January 1 of last year, and an increase of 86,622 tons (32.58%) compared to October 1 of last year. This is particularly evident for ships over 1,000 tons, with an increase of approximately 81,100 tons (approximately 33%) compared to October 1 of last year, and an increase of 48,061 tons (17.21%) compared to January 1 of last year. The reason is that the harvest of wheat, a major commodity, has been greatly reduced in the world's major producing areas this period, and the surplus capacity for export is low. At the same time, the cultivation in Europe, a region in need, is still not bad, leading to a gradual decrease in shipments. In addition, corn from Argentina and other countries has not yet reached the shipping season. Moreover, the economic circles of various countries have transitioned from the prosperity of one or two years ago to a reactive state of decline. Due to the sluggish shipping market and low freight rates, shipowners have no choice but to lay up ships.</p>
<h3>Malay Drama YS</h3>
<p>(Malay Drama is Much Better Than Chinese Drama) No one would believe that the drama of the foolish Malay people, who have no culture at all, would receive such praise from the audience, unless you have been to Southeast Asia and seen Malay drama.</p>
<p>The Malay people's talent for music and dance can be said to be a gift from heaven. It is said that their drama originated in India, but they were able to assimilate Indian drama and create a Malay drama, which is very admirable.</p>
<p>The material for Malay drama is also mostly taken from Indian folk tales and stories. Tragic plots are more common. We can also say that nine out of ten Malay dramas are (tragic dramas). This kind of (tragic drama) is naturally not very suitable for the trend of the times. However, we can appreciate it as a literary work. In addition, the plot is often interspersed with moving love songs, and the music is purely taken from Western instruments. The melodious and moving singing is truly rare. Therefore, we can also see the Malay people's skill in using and improving things.</p>
<p>The actors in Malay drama include both men and women. Men play male roles, and women play female roles, unlike our country, where men can play female roles, and women can play male roles. The effort put into expressions and acting is very satisfactory. As for the stage setting, they strive for realism. Even a flower or a blade of grass must be lifelike before they are let go. I wonder what the Chinese drama circles think of this spirit of theirs.</p>
<p>Finally, I also hope that the Chinese drama circles will work hard so that the audience of overseas Chinese will cancel the phrase "(Malay drama is much better than Chinese drama)."</p>
<h3>Malay Sorcery by Shi. Duo.</h3>
<p>The word "sorcery" is commonly used by our compatriots and means "secret medicine." Speaking of Malay secret medicine, its harm is truly unimaginable. Often, without realizing it, it can make your limbs or a certain part of your body crippled or even take your life. Moreover, when performing this kind of secret medicine, it is so mysterious and skillful that it is difficult to catch and prevent, so the compatriots who interact with them are very afraid of offending them in any way, fearing that they will play the trick of sorcery. Because the Malay people are a nation that has not yet shed its savage state, their minds are very narrow, and the thought of revenge is easily stirred up in their chests. So once you have offended them, they will bear a grudge and seek revenge when the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>They not only use this sorcery to seek revenge, but also use it to seek love or protect fruit trees. For example, if they are attracted to a certain girl but cannot win her favor due to various reasons, they use sorcery, either smearing oil on her flesh or drawing symbols for her to step over. Once the girl is affected by the sorcery, she will become infatuated with the man, no longer having the previous attitude of refusal. How mysterious and strange this is! As for using it to protect fruit trees, it is even more interesting. For example, if there is an orchard full of fruit and they are afraid that people will steal it, they hide this secret medicine at the base of the fruit trees, so that anyone who touches the base of the tree cannot move away or will not have good results when they return home.</p>
<p>Because sorcery has many uses, speaking of its types, there are also many kinds, and the raw materials for making this poison also vary depending on the type. For example, poisonous grasses and trees in the mountains, the pulp of fruits, and the marrow of animals are all materials for preparing sorcery. It is said that the most famous and fierce of the poisons is the juice of a poisonous tree called Iplb Batang. To extract it, they dig a hole in the tree, use a bamboo tube to collect the juice that flows out, and then mix it with the pulp of a certain grass root and boil it together. This evaporates the water and forms a solid, which can then be used.</p>

<p>The Buddha Statue Circulation Society announces that it has published more than 40 kinds of Buddhist statues and books, totaling hundreds of thousands of copies, which have been circulated as far as countries in the East and West. However, in order to promote Buddhism and art, the prices are lower than the cost to spread the circulation, so it has relied on donations of calligraphy and paintings from lay Buddhists over the years to supplement the shortage of printing funds from the sales. Qian Huafo, a lay Buddhist, has donated the most. Currently, due to the urgent need to raise funds, 30 of Qian's paintings are being sold at a special discount, divided into three types, A, B, and C, with the lowest price set at only ten yuan. They will be displayed in the society at No. 2 Lane, Qingyu Lane, New Chongqing Road, starting today.</p>

<h3>Introduction to the Study of Oil Painting</h3>
<p>Chen Baoyi</p>
<p>A few months ago, I saw the book (The Study of Oil Painting). This book is a collection of 40 lectures by 25 famous artists, selected from the articles solicited and published by the Japanese art magazine AIRLIER over the years. After reading it, I felt that this book is quite suitable for young people studying Western painting to refer to, because these dozens of short articles all describe the key points of research and production. Some describe the experience of production, some explain the methods of using materials, and some can give us a new hint in the research process. Especially considering the position of Easterners studying oil painting, it is enough to make us realize the path we should take. Therefore, I think this book is a very appropriate compass for our Eastern researchers. I then engaged in translation and writing in my spare time and am now nearing completion. I think I may have the opportunity to compile it into a book sometime.</p>
<p>Most of the original authors are contemporary leaders in the Japanese Western painting world, such as Yamamoto Kanae, Umehara Ryuzaburo, Nakagawa Kigen, Yorozu Tetsugoro (deceased), Okumura Hiroshi, Nakagawa Kazumasa, Hayashi Yoshie, Nabei Katsuyuki (and others omitted). Each article contains the unique characteristics of the author, that is, the painter. Therefore, when I translated, I felt that if I arbitrarily changed the words and expressions of the original author for the sake of habitual reading, so that the reader could not feel the spirit of the original text, it would be contrary to the translator's wishes and would be unfair to the original author. Therefore, although I feel my own clumsiness, I still try to convey the original text. Therefore, perhaps some sentences in it will seem difficult to understand to the reader. However, I feel that it seems unavoidable due to the reasons mentioned above, so I especially ask the reader for forgiveness.</p>
<p>It is also like what the preface of the original book said (as for what kind of golden words will be discovered from this book and how to apply them, this is the scope of research for the readers). Also, the translator has added annotations to various specialized terms and more difficult points in the original text. Taking advantage of the current opportunity, I will first select and publish a few of the translated drafts here. Also, I plan to publish the sister book (The Study of Sketching) in sequence.</p>

<h3>Babini Man Ru</h3>
<p>Modern Italian Writer</p>
<p>Giovanni Papini, the Italian writer whose (Storio id Cristo) caused a sensation in Europe and America, has once again attracted the world's attention with the sudden publication of his (Sand Agostino). Taking advantage of this opportunity, it seems appropriate to briefly introduce this Italian literary giant, who is not very familiar to us.</p>
<p>In 1906, Papini began his writing career with his collection of short stories Tragico Quotidiano and his collection of essays II Crepuscolo die Filosofi. 1906 was a very important year. The old Carducci Ottocentismo had split. Croce had come to the fore, and Marinetti and Futurism were on the horizon. In philosophy, empiricism had suffered a significant defeat, and the introduction of new foreign theories had a great influence. William James' pragmatism was one of them, but Bergson's philosophy did not make much progress in this peninsula. This phenomenon can be said to represent the significant difference between southern and northern Europe in thought today. In fact, James's theory was merged with the poetic and heroic characteristics of modern Italy, producing a new idealism of the nineteenth century. Our man Papini, who sees himself as a "creator" (Dewiurge), made his debut at this time, which was truly opportune.</p>
<p>However, it would not be entirely correct to say that Papini's literary career began when his works were first published in 1906. Accurately speaking, his literary career began three years earlier, when he founded and presided over the argumentative, pragmatic journal II Leonardo. This was one of the characteristics of the Florentine Renaissance in the early 20th century. This publication was a typical Tuscan mouthpiece, but it ran for five years from 1903 to 1907.</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>In 1908, La Voce was founded, and Papini later became the editor of this publication. In these two publications, Papini the critic gradually evolved. This was a (self-critical) critic, a judge of works of art and their shortcomings. His fierce momentum gave his style an inelegant state and personality expression. As for his style, it was then markedly deliberately crude and barbaric, as well as ambiguous phrases of the Neo-Romantics and Futurists. However, from this chaotic style, there would later emerge a critic who spoke with (sincere rhetoric) and concealed his sincerity with arrogant humility. Later, around 1910, a collapse occurred. Papini went through a mental crisis, at which time thought, life, and art all seemed to disappoint him greatly. His previous idealism had been completely shattered. His tragedy was the tragedy of a strong-willed man. He had explored the greatest possibilities of the will. He had discovered that besides this, there was only "death, madness, or the monastery." His first instinctive move was to escape. He wanted to create an external value, a value outside of the self. As a result, we saw his L'altra Meta. In this book, he tried to establish a philosophy of negation and contradiction, but he did not succeed much. This can be clearly seen in his autobiography Un Uomo Finito, published in the same year.</p>
<p>This period continued for some time. The years before the war were Papini's most painful years. The old Voce, the mouthpiece of literary, political, and philosophical thought, whose writers included many writers and philosophers, died in 1914, on the eve of the war. In the same year, although Papini and Soffici founded L'acerbe, this publication was also taken away by the war in 1915. However, although these two publications have passed away, Papini has made indelible contributions in their pages. He laid the foundation for national culture, spread a new intellectual atmosphere, overthrew old ideas, and ignited new thoughts. However, the sentiment of hatred did not diminish because of this, and remained the main sentiment in his articles.</p>
<p>From all of this, a better poet emerged. After the great storm passed, he discovered that he had many things in common with those heroic, reckless young people. Perhaps this was because of the war, but in the midst of all the devastation after the war, Papini was still Papini. His personality did not disappear at all, and he was still the same character as before.</p>
<p>After the war, Papini became famous throughout the world for his biographical works. For Papini, the meaning of biography is poetry. He used to say that the subject matter of biography should be a kind of ("intellectual thing"). This statement now seems quite doubtful. In fact, what he is concerned about is ("that living and complete reality, that is, individuality"). He himself is a person with the strongest individuality, so he regards individuality as the most important thing. He looks at history from the perspective of autobiography, and looks at the whole picture of society from the perspective of individual character. He tells us that the great figures of the past are all fragments of history. From these fragments, we can find ourselves. They are also corpses. We must breathe the breath of our lives into these corpses.</p>
<p>After reading his (Augustine), we believe that this is true. From Saint Augustine, that ("fragment of history"), did Papini not find himself? To Saint Augustine, that ("corpse") of the past, did Papini not breathe the breath of his life into him, making him a living person with a soul? The success of Papini's biographical works is mostly due to those two sentences.</p>
<h3>Thomas Mann's Novella Masterpiece</h3>
<p>Premature Grief Man Ru</p>
<p>A Representation of the Disillusioned State of Germany After the War</p>
<p>Everything Thomas Mann writes always receives a respectful and enthusiastic welcome in Germany. Therefore, when this long (short story) was published three years ago, although it was not as good as his novella masterpiece (Death in Venice) (Der Tod in Venedig), it was still very well received. However, foreigners who read this novel may not find it as intimate and interesting as Germans, because it contains a special kind of sentimental emotion, expressing the general disillusioned psychology of Germany after the war. It sadly writes about the family life and daily emotions of the dilapidated and impoverished German professional class and intellectual class in the years since the Great War. This situation is written very realistically, and still feels real when we hear it now, but the depressed and melancholic psychology and atmosphere that permeates the book cannot be appreciated unless one has had this kind of experience oneself. Therefore, foreign readers will not get a strong interest from this novel. However, if we want to know the general psychology and ordinary life of Germany after the war, then this novel is a very appropriate book. (English translation titled Early Sorrow, published by Martin Secker, London, priced at five shillings)</p>
<p>The structure of this novel is very thin, and the events that occur in it are very small. Roughly, it is like this: There is a history professor, Cornelius, who has two sons, Bertolt and Ingrid. These two young men hold a party at home to entertain their friends. They are all uninhibited and extremely disillusioned young people. They feel very sensitive, but their emotions are very cold. His stubborn character was created and hardened by the Great War. They all have a sense of the shortness of life and the disappearance of youth. They all hold the idea of seizing the day. Their mood is the same as that of most young people. For example, among their full house of friends, a large part of them have the same thoughts. Suppose that one of them, a very ordinary young man, danced several times with their little sister, the professor's beloved daughter, Erna. He had fun with her, talked about love, and teased her. For him, it was just acting on the spur of the moment, so he soon forgot about this little girl and forgot about this matter. However, that little girl seemed very precocious and was greatly provoked. Therefore, she felt very sad about his later indifference and cried. The adults saw that this little child suddenly cried, and did not know why. Of course, they used the old method of dealing with children and sent her to bed. But she was still crying, and no matter how they comforted her, they could not comfort her, especially her father's comfort made her feel especially sad. The old professor felt inexplicable and could not figure out the reason for his beloved daughter's strange sorrow. Later, the young man who caused the trouble knew about this matter, guessed the reason, and went to Erna's bedroom to kiss her, comfort her, and stay with her by the bed until she fell asleep. This was the first time Erna tasted the sorrow of life, but she tasted it too early.</p>
<p>The main body of the story is roughly like this. The plot is certainly very simple, but the book is full of profound thoughts, so it is definitely not a superficial and empty work. In this novel, we see the psychology of the old professor, who represents the father's generation, although it does not conflict with the psychology of the young people of the son's generation, it is always inconsistent. On the one hand, he prepares the arrangements for his children's party, but on the other hand, he thinks about what meaning this party has for him, a history professor. His heart belongs to that ("orderly and disciplined historical past"). The current excessive indulgence is not harmonious for him. He feels</p>
<p>that the past is immortal, that is to say, the past is dead, and death is the root of all sacredness and all lasting meaning.</p>
<p>Everything in the past is past, but everything in the present is very different from the past. The psychology of young people and the psychology of old people are very far apart, but old people do not have to resist the ("present"). ("The present") is the territory of young people, and the world of ("the past") is the world of old people, although it has passed, however, ("the past is immortal,") this is the psychology of old people.</p>
<p>Literary Anecdotes</p>
<h3>New Winner of the Goncourt Literary Prize</h3>
<p>The Goncourt Literary Prize, which is considered the most important of the various prizes in France, was awarded last year to the novelist Arland (Marcel Arland) for his novel (Order) (L'ordre). Arland is only thirty years old this year. His first work (Foreign Lands) (Terres Etrangeres) was published in 1923, followed by several novels in succession. (Order) was published last year and consists of three large volumes. It is a study of post-war France. (Ming)</p>
<h3>Barbusse as Editor-in-Chief</h3>
<p>Barbusse (Henry Barbusse), the author of (Under Fire) and (Clarity), is now the editor-in-chief of a newspaper in Paris. There are some great celebrities in his editorial department. Dr. A. Einstein, the inventor of the theory of relativity, is also one of them. (Ming)</p>
<h3>New Works by German Historical Novelists</h3>
<p>Walter Von Molo, who has gained a lofty status in Germany for several historical novels, has recently published a modern romance novel entitled Dis Scheidung. This novel examines the issue of marriage and divorce from a man's point of view. It interestingly describes a modern marriage and the reactionary conflicts of the main characters, etc. (Ming)</p>
<h3>O'Flaherty Has Another New Book</h3>
<p>O'Flaherty (Liam O Flaberty), the most important young novelist in Ireland, produces a lot and quickly. It is said that he will publish another novel this spring. This novel is based on his experiences at the front during the European War and is strangely titled (The Return of the Brute). O'Flaherty served as a foot soldier in the Irish Guards and was wounded in Belgium in 1917. (Ming)</p>
<h3>New Book Club in Spain</h3>
<p>There are now many ("new book clubs") in the United States, with members ranging from 40,000 to 100,000. The so-called ("new book club") is that each month the editorial department of the club selects the best of the newly published books and distributes them to each member (of course, they have to pay). This kind of group has a lot of authority in the United States. Now there is also one in the UK, but it is not very developed, because the British are more old-fashioned and there are many people who do not agree with this method. Recently, I heard that there is also a ("Spanish New Book Club") in Madrid, and the method is the same as that of the UK and the US. The most recently selected book is a translated novel called Pobre Blanco, which translated into English is Poor White. It was originally an old work by Sherwood Anderson. Now, in order to return the favor, Viping Press, the American publisher that publishes the original book, has also translated and printed a Spanish masterpiece, Zamacois's (Roots) (Roots). (Ming)</p>
