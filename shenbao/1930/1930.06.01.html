<h3>歐羅巴之病床</h3>
<p>法國普恩賚發表一文評論白里安所倡歐洲聨邦計劃爲歐羅巴之病床謂　但可安慰而無救於其病也以歐洲爲競爭最烈之地獨立自由最甚之地又爲相猜相忌最甚之地相仇相恨最深之地而欲合之成一聨邦其難無可言喻雖云各種政治仍任各國之自由而欲消去一切之競爭一地之猜忌仇恨其何能成苟其能成則歐洲早爲和平調洽之歐洲亦無需乎聨邦之組織矣</p>
<p>是不特歐洲一切爲然處今日而有和平調洽之計劃者皆病床之夢也人人有競爭之心懷猜忌之念存仇恨之見不遇事機勉强相安無事一旦風雲突起類皆乘機而求一逞海軍三大國之協約雖成而其國中不平之聲隨時隨地有所流露此亦可知可暫而不可久也</p>
<p>又不特國際間政治爲然以世界經濟而論受歐戰殘敝之後製造之力日增售買之力日减商業日衰失業日多雖各國之人用盡方法以事捕救而大抵多爲一時一地之計不久不但如故而益加甚此亦多數病床之夢徒安慰一時而無補於眞病者也</p>

<p>本報三十日東京電</p>
<p>歷世對頭之中菲排球隊本届又各以勝三敗一相等之比數互爭錦標最後决賽一幕風浪迭起極盡變化之能事結果中華出以九牛二虎之力以二對一獲勝奪得本屆錦標查大會錦標共八項除足球尙待下届解决外其餘咸落人手們國碩果僅存者惟此排球錦標耳</p>
<h3>唯一希望</h3>
<p>各項錦標已歸他人惟足球錦標據理而論中華不難再攫冠軍乃日人爲實現其數年來宿望起見寗遠反通行法規不顧與論批評毅然加以撓阻中華長保之錦標爲之不翼而飛唯一希望僅在排球一項矣</p>
<h3>皆大歡喜</h3>
<p>華橋愛國心熱連日奔波各場從旁助威大聲疾呼始終如一然每每結果所得徒使彼輩長嘆一聲失望而去今也中菲排球决賽之期已屆四團錦標空氣中之呼聲尤高於是携侣挾友相與俱來歡呼聲浪隨時可聞旣而劇戰畢大功成載奔載舞皆大歡喜</p>
<h3>虎視眈眈</h3>
<p>一時裁判高橋豐島蒞場中菲二國選手先後自萬衆鼓掌聲浪中魚貫入塲互相作輕便練習以舒筋骨磨拳擦掌蓄勢待發方虎視眈眈似有不世之仇以待一朝解决之狀態也</p>
<h3>心膽俱裂</h3>
<p>大戰開幕菲人供球有力擋攔敏捷又加以凈潔之推送悶猛之劈擊紀録旣開源源而來分數牌上逐漸增加未幾即以九比零占先觀衆至此心膽俱裂遥望前途不勝悵悵中華初戰不利由於求勝過切不免處置過分後努力追隨卒見曹廷贊奪回二分惟敵方中排步驟恰當先以十一對二比數調換陣線</p>
<h3>三雄稱强</h3>
<p>我軍聨合一致攻守有方大勢已轉生色漸起曹廷贊·徐亨·丘廣夑·三人劈擊有力不絕猛攻分數逐近惟以對方第一排甚佳因此收效不多然而雙方各以推陳出新之方法互相對付表演精彩爲全幕冠羣衆深爲嘉許稱大觀矣久而久之中菲二方各獲十六成相等局勢</p>
<h3>一氣呵成</h3>
<p>平手之後菲人大爲吃驚改變策略專向第三排進攻中華防綫稍鬆隙漏屢見菲乃得一氣呵成以二十一對十六勝第一局</p>
<h3>名將風采</h3>
<p>第二局起形勢不同我軍又顯其神勇名將風采畢竟不同流利合作中累有驚人之劈殺連楹朱祖成表演尤佳又因丘廣變供球得利開塲以四比零占先菲人幾度努力又成五五平數雙方攻守有方堪稱勁敵曹廷贊陳錫烟壓劈占勢不久即以十一比七調換戰地</p>
<h3>急轉直下</h3>
<p>嗣後雙方戰士精神激昻球往來飛舞摸捉不定我軍乘勝餘之威所向披靡陳錫炳數記殺手大局乃急轉直下頃刻以二十一對十六勝第二局成各一局勢之比</p>
<h3>再度遇險</h3>
<p>勝負各一局勢相等解决錦標端在此最後之第三局空氣緊張形勢嚴重雙方劇戰之下中華初以四比二占先繼而連次觸網挽救失策菲得勢如破竹以十一比七之差交換戰區</p>
<h3>三變轉機</h3>
<p>唯一之錦標希望至時漸有疑慮蓋已懸垂空中不知攫之者誰耶幸桂榮代徐亨出塲中華得此一枝生力軍實力大强各選手咸盡其所能努力猛進擬在此勝負樞紐之上獲得一綫生機果然以七比十一之差一變而成十一比十四再變而成十五比十七三變而成十七和數</p>
<h3>大功告成</h3>
<p>三變之後生氣勃然丘廣變曹廷贊陳錫炳擘出之球力猛如虎菲人不支攻守均感艱難迨至中華二十菲律濱十七時菲律濱尙作困獸猶鬥冀有萬一希望何奈我軍大勢已成逹到勝利目的似有反掌之易未幾以二十一對十七勝第三局總計二對一獲排球錦標</p>
<h3>升旂慶祝</h3>
<p>我國唯一之排球錦標已得如願以償大會場中之巨柱頓見中華國旗高張其上臨風招展氣象萬千全塲觀象起立致敬各國人士互送慶祝得勝選手被人包圍幾不得脫身而去誠盛事也</p>
<h3>英雄本色</h3>
<p>中菲排球比賽後記者晤菲敎練員爾蒙特據稱彼隊之結合不遜於中華第以殺球無力致不能多得分數就三國實力比較日本最弱中菲似相等但中國有三殺手其擊球皆有得手應心而黎連楹左手殺手之迅捷奇異又有非人力所可致者此次菲隊當自認失敗因處處已盡展其才能云按菲人此項宣言不失英雄本色</p>

<h3>菲律濱大施神威</h3>
<p>當時優勝之一隊其表演成績似非錦標隊所宜有遂予菲律濱莫大之機會第三局開其端獲中一分第七局再得一分第八局又加三出而以五零占前</p>
<h3>日人努力奪錦標</h3>
<p>日人屈於惡劣環境之下依然努力作戰冀圖恢復藉保全勝之名第八局之下半幕日人如睡獅初醒耀武揚威不可一世菲日防綫全破當時即開始獲得一分第九局大舉入攻回壘者絡續不已後來居上其時共得七分結果八對五日人獲勝綜觀雙方戰績菲雖敗挫成績較好計菲日各得安打九下而錯誤一項日有三次而菲僅有二次也</p>
<p>非僅選手五人已加裁判二人而彎變成七人矣吾人心目中惟中華爲我人勁敵日人不足道也中華有極完美之運動員的道德足令吾人歌佩而與以同情者也中華之敗因其不能如我人之有勇氣與對敵人對戰外尙須與裁判員周旋也</p>

<h3>四國爭雄回顧（道勝）</h3>
<p>轟轟烈烈之第九屆遠東運動會業於昨晚閉幕結果日本獲大會總錦標中華亞軍菲律濱第三印度殿軍</p>
<h3>中華失敗由來</h3>
<p>全國人民一致熱望之中華隊表演平庸出人意外雖得亞軍因其成績較上屆爲遜仍不得不自認失敗也然其最大原因有二（一）我國所擅長者球類其中尤以足球排球籃球三項最有希望乃消息傳來多因個人自私自利缺少合作工夫功虧一簣名落深山籃球之全軍覆没職是故耳（二）日人裁判員每爲情緒所感之忘其超然之地位歷屆皆然惟今尤甚致令大會完美之空氣中含有不歡之成分我國上進階級一旦爲其撓阻雖力爭公平終歸無效惟有宣告失敗之一途耳日人處置足球之不法是其明證以此例彼其餘慨可想見矣</p>
<h3>日本美中不足</h3>
<p>日之成績優美獲得勝利早在意中過於重視有是竟不惜抛棄正大光明之態度與手段致使與會之中菲代表爲之扼腕暵息美中不足至爲憾事也</p>
<h3>菲人幾乎全敗</h3>
<p>菲之人才平均可觀彼之目標並不在冠軍而在乎與中華互奪亞軍之一席耳然而竟告失敗退居第三最後幸自日人手中奪來籃球錦標免致全軍覆没是亦不幸中之大幸也</p>
<h3>印度雖敗猶榮</h3>
<p>印人以偉大之勇氣毅然赴日參加實行其會員之職務勝負利鈍置之腦後其民族精神之表演至足動各國之視綫爭旗一事尤具氣節千秋之下猶有餘榮也</p>

<p>會塲瑣紀（瞿自東京寄）</p>
<h3>大會並不守時間</h3>
<p>大會定二十四日正午開幕及至午砲響時鐘長針已過五分壇上除留聲機片鏘鏘聲外别無聲息座中一中國女士帶譏諷之聲曰（日人也不守時間）本來大會之中事務紛紜布置不易遲幾分鐘不必過事吹求惟日人對於火車輪船等素以嚴守時刻相誇詡而於此燦爛莊嚴之大會開會典禮獨露此破綻無怪難免濟議也</p>
<h3>不聽話之留聲機</h3>
<p>開會前爲慰觀衆寂寞起見於正壇上聲音放大機前特奏留聲機片及至貴賓大員將就席時司令處大呼停止留聲機而司機生竟忙中失措愈撥而機聲愈響惹得全塲騰笑</p>
<h3>華選手之聲色</h3>
<p>選手整隊入塲時中華隊居先以逯明李國琛二君執旗左右爲陳氏兩姊妹花極爲出色選手宣誓時我國由張麟佳君代表張君體格魁梧聲音宏亮與壇上又高又胖之張伯苓博士相映成趣他菲印日本等國選手代表非其貌不揚即語音低闇皆不如我國之先聲奪人</p>
<h3>棒球一戰勝菲</h3>
<p>大會第一日下午二時半中菲棒球舉行第一次大戰至第四塲時我軍已得三點菲軍尙屬空空其投手屢次失着將捕手急得汗留浹背怱嫌手套不適取下調整旋又將頭盔摘下一時無處放置遂夾胯間其又心又急情形殊堪發噱棒球戰第七場時我軍馮玉和張榮安二君曾兩次盜壘敏捷非常至第八塲時菲軍佔滿壘竟被我軍投手鄭發君絕處逢生連投六個Stnik將敵軍完全覆滅卒以九對六勝菲我軍選手博得全塲喝采</p>
<h3>印度二重國旗</h3>
<p>印度爲本届新加入者選手僅三人物以少爲貴此少數之選手大得觀衆青睞開會辭及祝辭等皆千篇一律以歡迎印度之新參加爲言惟開會前發生國旗問旗先是有人以印度係英屬地尙未獨立且對駐日暎國公使館有所顧忌故宜用英國旗或以爲甘地正從事領導全印人民爲抗英運動甘地之白緑紅三色扇形旗始是代表印度之眞正國旗結果仍用英旗亡命日本之印度革命志士爲此曾發宣言否認該三選手爲印度代表今日（二十四日）開會印度隊採取折衷辦法持英國旗及甘地旗各一面入塲居然呈二重國旗之奇觀</p>

<h3>一得之言秋水</h3>
<p>戀愛是心的激剌品腦的麻醉藥常識的催眠丸</p>
<p>說謊在孩子們是一種過失在求愛者是一種藝術在未婚者是一種成功而在已婚的男女却是他們的第二天性</p>
<p>在原則上講男子們决不肯對女子們講實話雖然他自知不說謊對於他更有利益</p>
<p>差不多每個男子可以使一個女子相信黑的是白不過要使伊把黑色認爲玫瑰之紅那末自非有藝術的技巧之男子不可</p>
<p>在事業上或在賭博塲裏一個男子有很强的自制力和很精密的計劃可是在戀愛的戰塲上每個男子都好像一輛汽車從高山上下來一般的難以自制</p>
<p>要使一個女人愛你有一個技巧就是把你的眼力把你的心靈把你的精神同時集中於一個女人</p>
<p>年青的女子喜歡男子們見伊而眩目年老的婦人却喜歡男子們見伊而鼓舞</p>
<p>有許多男子有着空餘的心靈去愛兩個女子可是有這般腦力能同時愛上兩個女子的却在少數</p>
<p>有許多愛人和已婚的男女决不自覺其相處的快樂除非等到他們離開之後感着悽寂了的時候</p>
<p>有許多男女是爲了便利而結婚並不是爲了變愛純粹的爲了戀愛而結婚的男女他們决不會離異</p>

<h3>屠牲塲參觀記程志政</h3>
<p>月之二十六日本埠交通大學三年級市政班同學由唐敎授之領導往虹口參觀屠牲塲耳聞目擊有足述者爰舉以實本談</p>
<p>血腥觸鼻二時許入門血腥之氣中人欲嘔同時水門汀上積血成渠蓋全滬所有之肉食供給大都皆仰給於此也工人往來頗形栗六予儕咸掩鼻而過之</p>
<p>西人招待未幾一西人出而招待頗和譪可親爲予等詳述各種情形謂此處日屠牛五十餘頭猪百餘頭羊數十頭各種肉類一一加以化騐完好無缺者列頭等稍羸或略有疾病者列二等其有疾病者則擯棄之所有製好肉品即於屠後入市銷售</p>
<p>各項工作概况由該西人之領導逐部加以說明先至皮革部即剥自牛身者由工人將肉刮去然後摺皮成長方形出售於皮革廠每磅約二角七分繼入一巨室内懸已屠之牛甚多一一加印步行其間若入肉林其猪羊等亦皆如法泡製剖腹後打氣入膚使肉澎漲而工作完成</p>
<p>殺牛之手續殺牛時先以鐵錘擊牛腦牛暈而後始殺之蓋亦减少其痛苦者也惟一辦事室中藏手槍多種係用以射牛首者在英國屠牲此項手續爲法律所規定今爲避免麻煩計改彈射爲錘擊然而牛苦矣牛被殺後即加以支解片刻即將各項工作完了以不用機器之故效率當然不能與支加哥之屠牲塲相比擬也（按支加哥屠牲塲前已由志政記於本刋）</p>
<p>牛之檢毒法肉食首重衛生故檢毒實爲最重要之工作西人以一有肺疾之牛肺見示則斑點纍纍令人心悸設人食之尙堪設想耶後又至牛塲參觀相距約數十武即逹所儲之牛甚多皆準備第二日行刑者據云該項牛羊大抵來自丹陽常州一帶每頭價格不一自數十元至百元不等然大都瘦削可憐孟子所謂聞其聲不忍食其肉又云吾不忍見其觳觫吾儕雖以學術之研討來此參觀然他日回念此景恐亦不免投箸廢食也西人又云檢騐牛之有毒與否可先握其角無病者角必凉反之必熱又常牛耳必直竪病牛多下垂至毛亦有關係此種常識之鑒别初無須乎剖騐而後知也</p>
<p>休息一天凡牲口之裝運來滬者當日暫留飼此塲因舟車勞頓非翌日不宜屠也又屠前一日不能飼以食料必令枵腹就刑此亦衛生之道然背乎仁人之心遠矣</p>
<p>狗監牢除牛場外尙有狗牢一所多爲洋種獵犬詢何以至此則曰此蓋曾嚙人者也拘留此處十日以騐其有無神經病如無十日有期徒刑後即釋放是管理之周密又不能不令人欽敬至四時許始别指導者而散</p>
<h3>布穀鳥談清</h3>
<p>布穀鳥候鳥也每至春末夏初其聲若呼（割麥挿禾）而吾鄕老農者流則諧其音變若（家家種花）蓋不挿秧於時棉種亦須下故此鳥亦名（催耕鳥）具有深意顧世無公冶長其人固無能辦此鳥語也</p>
<p>考之爾雅一名（鳲鳩）又名（鵠　）謂即布穀也其他如月令曰「搏榖」本草曰「撥榖」方言曰「擊榖」亦書曰「步姑」或以爲皆布穀之轉音其說非是而江以東謂之（穫穀）郭注以爲喚雨之鳩則又誤爲（卜姑）而視與斑鳩同類矣不知其聲絕異昔德清俞氏以鳩不能爲巢不指爲鳩鵒而以班鳩當之與章太炎以布穀爲鵓鴣其失正同余誦放翁初夏詩首曰（紛紛紅紫已成塵布穀聲中夏令新）乃覺是鳥之聲聒耳而阡陌之間麥隴黄雲轉瞬彌望青碧而秧針如髮已是鳥形如（杜鵑）而其體較大色灰黑頷下微白有綫紋横𠄣胸腹間其飛甚緩時作鳴聲所異者嘗孤棲無偶過此春耕夏耘之際即不見蹤影或謂之（神鳥）疑莫能信余友李君石鯨謂西人某博物家曾考是鳥能生卵而不能孵育就他鳥之巢見有已生之卵者往往乘隙亦產卵其間恐他鳥以數之增多而見疑也必以爪剔去其固有之卵以掩其目俟其雛出他鳥知非我族類而靳不與食乃是鳥雖幼即狡伍於衆雛中能奮其肥嫩之肉翮以掀他雛離其巢穴推堕而下彼乃得飽食以成長一至羽毛豐滿遂飛去獨自生活並謂攝有影片是鳥之離奇變幻有非其他禽類所能擬議者觀此亦足以供學者之研究惜其出處未能明指猶爲憾事余故述之世之治生物學者儻亦有以語我乎</p>

<h3>五月份銀拆較上數月爲昻</h3>
<p>本年已經過去之四個月中銀根因大勢鬆疲銀拆卒難轉昻故每月扯計總不足法定二兩之額獨上月份因金融界時有同業中互相傾軋行爲彼此競持息價以致每見一二錢之昻價結果全月統計共有四兩○五分以三十天扯計每日折成一錢三分五厘蓋上月有三十一天若以三十一天扯計則每天僅佔一錢三分○六毫四五間如是本月份議開存息底碼大約總在四兩九五扣之譜姑誌以覘其騐</p>
<h3>開銀拆時間提早</h3>
<p>定爲八時開做</p>
<p>現值晝長夜短錢業市場銀拆開羅時間前因日短則爲上午八時半集會開做市面近日八時半則各商業早市貿易多時未見太晏於是有提早之必要昨經市塲委員揭示報告對於六月二日起（本六月一日起因一日夏節休業故二日起）盤會開盤時間提早半小時定爲八時開銀拆以應市上之需要而利各業之貿易云</p>

<p>現代丹麥文學（續）</p>
<h3>趙景深在復旦大學演講</h3>
<p>陳燮檉</p>
<p>湯增敭筆記</p>
<p>非（約特蘭派）的人我們首先要說的便是奈克蘇</p>
<p>奈克蘇（Martin　andersen　Vexo　1864)他的出現代表丹麥另一部分的思想因爲他的思想完全和（約特蘭派）不相容他生於哥乎哈德過着極貧困的生活九歲時便和父母移居Bornholm石島上這島也就是他父親從前的誕生處奈克蘇堅受禮後即爲牧童也曾做過了鞋匠的學徒但因不喜歡悶在房裏後來又做了泥水匠的助手和運送磚瓦的事後入Askov鄕間中學他很喜歡讀書得了一些智識便開始寫作這時快要三十歲了一八九八年作短篇小說集（影）寫意大利與西班牙的風土人情一九○一年作The　Frank　Family一九○二年作（細雨）描寫黑暗而且悲觀的是自然主義的手法但這些都不是他的代表作他的巨作者（勝者辟爾）(Pelle　the　ConquerorI-IV1906-1910)全書共四本第一本寫糼年時在Bornholm石屋中的回憶生活第二本寫學徒時的工做第三本寫反抗的思想作者創造了一個主人翁依照着作者自己所說他不僅很忠心和氣的表揚窮人的傳統的德人且能描寫他們能保守諧談的意義和快樂元量及生活的優美作者爲了（勝者辟爾）曾受國際的聲譽同時能領導工人向光明的路上走奈克蘇此外還有一部重要的著作爲（狄戴人的女兒）作者在這書中寫的是女性的辟爾狄戴的故事比辟爾的故事更其黑暗她是一個可憐的女僕從摇籃到墳墓一生的困苦都集在一身使人動無限的悲憫之意</p>
<p>傑阿陀（Kund　Hjorto1860）所寫的小說大都是描寫鄕士的他也是一個農家子他第一部小說是（鄰家）一九○一年出版此後又出Rasmus（一九○九）和（敎區内外）（一九一九）所寫大都是社會心理思想透入觀察力非常敏銳寫言語以女人和幼兒爲最能逼肖但他的書很不易讀一九○四年作（灰與星）一九○五年作（兩世界）一九○六年作HawoDaoko這三部曲中充滿了幻想和熱情一九二一年作（浮士德）書中含有許多哲學的元素和生死的問題作者的小說大都是短篇而且版數也很少如我國出版的書每版普通約在二千册以上而他的小說每版便只有五百到八百本因爲引不起人的注意所以作者在他的木國不易出名在外國反而很有聲譽</p>
<p>阿托倫（Atto　Rnuy,1874）一九○六年作有（白快船）一九○九年作（過去之影）一九一四年作（大旅行隊）一九一二年作（祕密室）一九一九年作（極樂島）一九二二年作（當水沉時）他的作品很多動作善用Suspevse强烈而且驚人作者的小說的關鍵緊凑相間是一種通俗性的有供給一般人消閒的趣味如（白快船）（大旅行隊）很能引起讀者一種剌激書中表現動作的地方極多非常雜閙如我國的（施公案）（水滸）一樣他的小說當然是屬於舊的一面舊的尙雜鬧的新的尙沉默的深刻的人的觀的</p>
<p>吉德（Harald　Kidde,1878-1918）他的描寫是透入之深處的能够完全了解思想不同的人而且很同情於苦難的人他的文體是莊嚴沉思的作品也很多（一）（寓言畫）（一九○○）是一部寓言集（二）Aage　and　Else（一九○二－一九○三）是長篇的丹麥童謡故事書中寫一個已死的武士因愛人的悲痛而復活但不久又死了顯出死與生之勝利主人翁TneTavsen是個憂鬱病者見許多愛人一一爲他而死又想復活lull　wedev使其生又失敗了悲劇便從此結束（三）（空氣城堡）（一九○四）（四）（瞎者）（一九○六）（五）（法律）（一九○九）（六）（别人）（一九○九）（七）（被祝福者）（一九一○）（六）（七）兩部樂觀的）（八）英雄（一九一二）（九）（餓）（一九一八）他幼年棄神學但却愛宗敎生活曾做可憐卑鄙的敎師後來在孤島上宣佈上帝的光明與人民的福利抛棄一己的樂夢（餉）描寫瑞典國中的事書中的思想很難索解作者於此書出版數星期後死於時疫只有四十一歲</p>
<p>珂爾（Ａage　van　Koht,1877）寫野蠻頽唐的小說作有（薇菌之宫）（Ｉ－ＩＩＩ一九○八）寫軍船的傾覆文中充滿了恐怖和失望</p>
<p>丹麥的女作家没有瑞典那樣多而且重要但也有幾位是很有名的</p>
<p>萊姆綺（Gyrith　Semche,1866）以歷史小說著名她的最有名的作品是Edwardsgaue（Ｉ－ＩＶ一九○○－一九一二）　　米契麗絲（Karin　Nuchaeliw872）1她最有名的是關於心理的小說作有（碎玻璃女）（一九二四）</p>
<p>西特·晋生（Thit　heneen1876）少年時代曾度過一時的農民的生活她的思想很純潔也很富於熱情她覺得墮落的人生是不配爲人的後來作了一本劇本（）（Stork）牠是北歐的一種鳥名據傳說這鳥常帶嬰孟給人間的母親此劇是提倡生育節制的（未完）</p>

<p>青年園地</p>
<p>（文舅舅）裏面底素妮六和</p>
<p>在我所知道底有數的外國文藝作家之内俄國的契訶夫是我最喜歡底一個</p>
<p>他的短篇小說我譜得並不多可是每逢讀過一篇牠總留給我一個極深刻的印象他的劇本在作品的量上比他們小說少得多的我更其讀得少可是就這僅有的幾篇已經夠使我不忍釋卷了他的劇本是用他原來寫小說底手腕和筆寫作的所以在那裏面和在小說裏面一樣你休想找得着什麽傳奇的英雄出衆的天才絕世的美人等你所看見底只是些平凡的人物這些人物祇要你稍微留心一些時常可以在你們的家人中間在你們有朋友中間在你們的周遭發見的牠的内容也只是零碎摭拾些平凡的人生底瑣屑來反映出十九世紀末葉底惶惑和黑暗的俄羅斯的悲哀而已</p>
<p>這種題材的作品是感動了多多少少當時和現代的讀者們呀一旦聽見自己心愛的劇作家底作品有搬上舞台底消息這眞是多麽使我狂喜的事呀儘管在電車和公共汽車都在罷工期内交通怎樣不便要我不去看辛酉劇團底（文舅舅）這是萬萬忍不到的</p>
<p>我現在不想批評他們這次公演的成績如何好在看過他們歷屆的公演尤其是去年的（狗底跳舞）底觀衆都有公論的我祇想把我那天看罷了戲在那將圓未圓的清寒的月光底下在那凄寂欲死的神秘之街上兜回家去那時候所感到底說不出的悒鬱寫下來這種悒鬱是我在看戲之前預期着去接受的</p>
<p>（文舅舅）裏面底人物除掉那兩個不足重輕的工人之外誰都是過着（難堪而悲慘的日子底身世可憐的傷心人）海蘭韋逸文素娓那不必說了就是那個給韋逸文所妬忌底說（他的桃花運交得多好從前唐皇所享底艶福也不過如此吧）底史敎授他又何嘗没有他的悲哀呢</p>
<p>是的誰都是身世可憐的傷心人但是不知道爲什麽我會獨獨對那）因爲相貌平庸）没有人愛底素妮表深切的同情丨不我竟愛上她了</p>
<p>她的身世她的遭遇她的一切都彷彿和我有些面熟似的她撥動了我的心弦她攪起了我的悲哀</p>
<p>是的她不單單是一個勤苦力作而又賢慧的鄕下姑娘她自有她自己的偉大她是過不慣（這種荒凉岑寂的時光碰不到一個像樣的人到處只看見這班懨懨無生氣的東飄西蕩地說些無聊的話除了吃喝睡之外什麽都不知道底鬼東西）她自然是要像（在黑夜裏看見了月亮上來）那樣歡喜似的去愛上了那個（那麽出衆·那麽漂亮·那麽有趣·那麽可愛）底年輕的趙醫生了你看她是多麽愛他呀她在第一幕裏在趙醫生面前向海蘭稱述他的對於樹林的熱心和功績口口聲聲地說他說樹林怎樣····（他說樹林會····）眞像背流水賬似的流暢這可想見一個可憐的小姑娘每晚在臨睡之前在她的床前默誦她的愛人日間所說底話語一字不遺地一遍丨兩遍丨無數遍來代替她的晚禱</p>
<p>在第二幕裏她勸趙醫生不要再喝酒那時候底她才眞苦呀她是眞心愛他的她是不願意他（學那些喝酒打牌底下流人底行爲）的她是不願意他（毁壞他自己）的但是她又怕着在他的面前說這樣子的不自量的話未免有些冒失喔單戀的人底苦痛呀</p>
<p>她又吞吞吐吐地隱隱約約地假託着說有一個朋友或是妹妹愛了他來探聽他的口氣可是結果是（一點意思也没有他的心他的靈魂還是跟我隔膜可是怎麽我又覺得有點莫名其妙的快樂呢我自己也想不透這是什麽道理</p>
<p>這是矛盾但是這是人生</p>
<p>如果你戀上了一個人你就喜歡跟他或她在一起像素妮對趙醫生說（你在我們這兒過夜是難得的）（你看好了病作準回到這兒來吃午飯）（你過幾時再來呢····不要出一個月好嗎）但是眞在一起了之後你看出對方對你（一點意思也没有）你就會感到没趣感到悲哀同時你又會感到有趣像素妮一樣回味着趙醫生的一舉一動彷彿（我現在還能覺到他的聲音還在空氣中震蕩着呢）（彷彿没有一刻不聽見他在我的旁邊我還覺得他的手還緊握着我的手）這是矛盾這是不能用理智來解釋的</p>
<p>她愛他實在太熱烈了在第三幕裏她對她的後母說（我已經愛了他有六年了我愛他勝過愛我的母親可是他從不看我一看我的人竟没有在他的眼裏）她又說（我自己不能尊重了我的心把握不定了我没有主意了）</p>
<p>她的後母答應她替她問他探一點口氣她說（我們只要曉得他有意思還是没有要是没有那末他以後一定得不要到這兒來）</p>
<p>結果是從她的後母口中她知道他眞的（一點意思都没有）她是深深地沉入失望的深淵裏了</p>
<p>但是你們看吧她是怎樣地解决她的苦悶</p>
<p>在第四幕裏她勸她的舅舅拿出嗎啡來底時候說（我的命恐怕比你的還要苦呢但是我並不撒手我熬起我的痛苦而且要一直熬下去只要我還有一口氣在這兒她又說（我們做些事吧）</p>
<p>（做些事吧做些事吧）這是作者契訶夫借素妮的口說出他自己的主義來的用（工作）來忘記（苦悶）於我這是一個對於人生的莫大的啓示</p>
<p>也許有人說作者是悲觀的是否定人生的但是至少在這齣（文舅舅）裏他是樂觀的是肯定人生的你聽素妮的話吧（我們有什麽法子呢我們總得過我們的日子我們要過那一大串後來的迢迢的長日和漫漫的長夜我們要耐心忍受那命裏註定的刦難我們要趁現在就是將來我們老了底時候也照樣要一刻不停地辛苦爲人家做事等到我們的大數到</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>來我們要安安靜靜地死去到了那兒到了那兒天上我們要申述我們曾經受過痛苦的磨折·····那末老天爺會憐憫我們呢啊我們得看見那光明爘爛的生活了我們將歡樂將感想到這現在我們的苦惱悠然一笑於是我們將休息了······我們聽見仙人底聲音我們將看見像寳石般光輝底天堂我們將看見一切罪惡和一切我們的痛苦都融化在那彌漫於天地底偉大的情愛裏頭我們的生活將有古井一般的平靜春天一般的温柔蜜糖一般的甜美我相信的·····我的可憐的文舅舅呀你從没有嘗過什麽是快樂但是你等着吧我們將休息了···</p>
<p>···）</p>
<p>人世間也許有像素妮一樣苦悶一樣身世可憐的人吧我希望他們看一看多少能給他們些安慰多少能替他們解脫些苦悶底偉大的（文舅舅）呀</p>

<h3>中國之地質研究概况</h3>
<p>中央研究院地質研究員葉良輔（二）實際的貢獻</p>
<p>這一項不容易詳細說明因必要用到許多專門述語所以祇能大略說說</p>
<p>從過去十幾年的調查研究看來中國地面雖大礦產種類雖多數量實在太少就是煤鐵二項比較多些但是亦並没有同外國人所揣斷的那末多大約煤的儲量是二十一萬兆噸（二一七六二六兆噸）其中無烟煤四百兆噸（四三五九三兆噸）烟煤及亞烟煤十七萬兆噸（一七三四六五兆噸）謁炭五百兆噸（五六八兆噸）和世界和國比較居第四位（次於美國和加拿大德國及英國）在遠東算是第一名了重要的煤田當然在直魯豫晋和東三省鐵礦有九百五十兆噸重要鐵礦在奉天河北湖北安徽江蘇山東江西這幾省在太平洋沿岸各國之中占第一位若是中國實業發逹起來亦祗夠自己二三百年之用</p>
<p>此外銻錫水銀金鎢錳銅鋅鉛只有幾處著名的產地其餘另星小礦產是否可設法利用還須考慮</p>
<p>至於地史方面從最古到最新的地層中國很算完備各時代的海陸變遷生物變遷已經大致明白所最欠缺的是否省的詳細地質構造這是在乎有人材能長斯的工作才爲明白</p>
<p>總之國内實業不發逹需用專門知識的機會有限雖有工作的結果放着也極少有人去用因此學以致用的成效不顯著這是很可惜的專就礦產研究一項來論我敢說現在已有的成績和研究程度似乎已超過國内所需要的但是我們還是向前做去預備着材料給人家用</p>
<p>還有一種間接的貢獻就是地質界按了軌道去研究學術的精神和成績竟能引起别種科學的專門人材也去工作起來近年來國内各科學的研究丨尤其是自然科學丨多少各有些成績這也是原因之一</p>
<p>（三）研究人材</p>
<p>中國的地質人材最先一期祗有三四位從外國游學回來的隨後北京農商部設了地質研究所（高等專門學校）三年之後敎成了二十二人其中三分之二在北平地質調查所服務并且大半派到外國去過此後北京大學又辦地質系先後畢業的已逹百餘人現在各處研究機關的也共有好幾位到外國去留學的也有幾位此外中央大學中山大學燕京大學山西大學多在那裏敎育地質專門人才</p>
<p>最後我要說在中國研究地質有幾種困難（一）眞正能指導研究的領袖太少我所指的是研究有素學問充實的領袖並非善於張羅經費應酬各方的領袖因此有志研究的人多在那裏充先鋒隊並且不免走黑路求研究成功此外國的後進人才難得多有人說可雇用外國人來指導這雖是一個辦法但是要曉得如果自己没有相當的學問來駕御外國人要他們專心指導是很難得的眞正有學問的肯到中國來他自己也有目的（二）研究機關的經費不能照發做事的不能膽大進行（三）現在各地方太不安靖盜匪太多不能從容暢快的到實地去研究要增進未來的成績祗能望這幾種困難逐漸減少</p>

<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>The Central Army Crosses Lanfeng</h3>
<p>Enemy Liaison severed</p>
<p>To Join Forces in Zhengzhou Soon</p>
<p>The Third Division of the Nanjing Army telegraphed to Nanjing reporting that the Central Army launched a large-scale fierce attack at 2 PM on the 29th, routing the rebellious enemy. Lanfeng has been captured and our entire division has crossed Lanfeng. We will join forces in Zhengzhou soon. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and is currently being pursued. (Special telegram from the 31st)</p>
<p>According to news from Xuzhou, on the morning of the 29th, the central army on both the left and right wings besieged the enemy's positions in the Lanfeng area. There was fierce hand-to-hand combat and the enemy's outer defense line was breached, crossing the first trench. The enemy suffered many casualties and the attack is still continuing. (Special telegram from the 30th)</p>
<p>Military news from Xuzhou states that the enemy has established new defense lines on the Longhai and Pinghan lines. These lines are long and stretch far but are vulnerable to our attacks. Our army has cut off the enemy's communication between the Longhai and Pinghan lines. (Special telegram from the 30th)</p>
<p>Qian Zongze from Xuzhou returned to Xuzhou from the front lines on the 30th. He stated that the bridges and roads east of Neihuang have been completely repaired and there are no major battles on the front lines at present. (Special telegram from the 30th)</p>
<p>Military news from Xuzhou states that the remaining enemy forces in Luyi are surrounded and will be dealt with shortly. (Special telegram from the 30th)</p>
<p>News from Xuzhou states that the central army has broken through the enemy's defense line in the Qixian area. (Special telegram from the 30th)</p>
<p>The Nanjing Garrison Command released a comprehensive report on the 31st based on dispatches from various sources: (1) In our army's capture of Yanggeji, the rebellious enemy, numbering about two divisions, stubbornly resisted while occupying the walled village and mountains. After a fierce assault by our army, all the regimental and battalion commanders of Sun Chu's unit were killed in action. The regimental adjutants surrendered to our forces, and after confiscating their weapons, the officers and soldiers were sent to the rear for resettlement. (2) Sun Liangcheng's troops have been fighting our army for days, losing battle after battle. The corpses of the rebellious soldiers piled up in front of our positions, emitting a foul stench. Our army completely routed the rebellious forces and, after inspecting the corpses, found two regimental commanders and over ten regimental adjutants and battalion commanders. Sun Liangcheng suffered heavy injuries and fled west in a state of panic. (3) Jin's rebellious Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry unexpectedly encountered our army near Taikang. Caught off guard, the rebellious cavalry was heavily bombarded by our infantry and machine guns. The number of enemy soldiers and horses killed was countless and over 800 warhorses were captured. Military equipment, supplies, and the flag and seal of the puppet division headquarters were also seized. Zhao narrowly escaped capture. (4) The rebel army of Taizi, led by Ye Qijie, had a force of about three regiments and one battalion. Our army attacked at night and fought fiercely with the enemy for a full day and night. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely and occupied Taizi at 6 AM on the 30th, killing hundreds of enemy soldiers and capturing six Type 13 mountain guns, six machine guns, six mortars, over sixty submachine guns, and countless other military supplies. The enemy forces have been completely routed, with some fleeing to the Qinghe ferry. (5) The enemy forces in Qingcheng, numbering over one regiment, have been surrounded by our army. (6) Our army has been engaged in fierce battles for days with Fan's rebellious troops, who stubbornly resisted in the vicinity of Xuchang, and has won successive victories. At 8 AM on the morning of the 30th, our forces completely routed Fan Wangli's rebel troops and occupied Dashiqiao. Fan himself was seriously wounded, and Sun Zhenhua was killed in action. The rebel army suffered more than half casualties, and our army captured many prisoners who are currently being interrogated. At this moment, our army has crossed Xiaolidian, attacked Xuchang, and is advancing on Xinzheng. It is only a matter of time before we join forces in Zhengzhou. (Special telegram from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Xinzheng Under Siege</h3>
<p>Wang Jinyu telegraphs Nanjing with news of victory</p>
<p>Heshangqiao Already Occupied</p>
<p>Wang Jinyu telegraphed Nanjing stating that the Su and Huang brigades of Shangguan's division occupied Heshangqiao and other places on the 29th. They are now joining forces with Xu Yuanquan's troops to besiege Xinzheng. The rebel leaders Fan and Ren have fled to Zhengzhou. Only a portion of Zhang Weixi's troops remain inside Xinzheng City and it will be captured soon. (Special telegram from the 31st)</p>
<p>Xu Yuanquan telegraphed Nanjing reporting that Zhang Gui's army had fled to Hunan. He has received successive telegrams from He Yunqiao stating that Liu Jianxu's troops have been deployed and are gathering in Hengzhou to strike a head-on blow. It is unlikely that there will be any problems. The situation on the Pinghan and Longhai fronts is very favorable. Although we have suffered some casualties, the enemy's losses are certainly many times greater than ours. The rebel Fan is no longer capable of attacking. Our army's morale has doubled and we are currently launching fierce attacks on the enemy from both the Longhai and Pinghan sides. It is inevitable that the rebels will collapse, and it will not be long before we join forces in Bian and Zheng. (Special telegram from the 31st)</p>
<p>A telegram from Luohe, Nanjing on the 31st stated: (1) Zhang Weixi's headquarters was set up on Zhangdian Street and was attacked by Xu Yuanquan's troops today. Subsequently, Shangguan Yunxiang's division arrived and defeated the enemy force, seizing countless weapons. Zhang himself was seriously injured. (2) Xu Yuanquan, Wang Jinyu, Shangguan Yunxiang, Hao Mengling, Xiao Zhichu, and others are jointly pursuing the enemy. (3) He Chengjun offered a reward of tens of thousands of yuan to whoever captures Heshangqiao and Zhengzhou first, because Zhangdian Street had been captured and the main force of the rebellious troops was in Heshangqiao. (3) He Chengjun went to Dashiqiao to the north on the evening of the 30th to inspect. Wang Jinyu and Xu Yuanquan both came. The fighting on the front lines is still fierce. The Northwestern rebellious troops are discouraged and it will not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. (Special telegram from the 31st)</p>
<p>He Chengjun telegraphed from Hankou reporting a great victory in Xu on the 30th, with the capture of 24 regimental and battalion commanders. A reward was offered for capturing Heshangqiao and attacking Zhengzhou. (Special telegram from the 30th)</p>

<p>Song Hegeng, Director of the Hunan Construction Department, and Tan Changkai, Minister of Propaganda, arrived in Hankou at noon on the 29th to meet with He Yingqin and report on the Hunan army's efforts to block the rebels. They also requested that troops be sent to assist. He Yingqin immediately agreed to send troops and dispatched airplanes to Hunan. (Special telegram from the 29th)</p>
<p>Airplanes sent from Nanjing are scheduled to fly to Hunan on the 30th. (Special telegram from the 29th)</p>
<p>He Yingqin ordered warships to proceed from Yuezhou to Changsha as soon as possible. (Special telegram from the 29th)</p>
<p>A telegram from Changsha, Nanjing on the 31st stated that the rebel forces of Zhang, Gui, and Tang entered Hunan from Guangxi, Pingxiu, Renli, Fupu, Longhu, and other places, occupying and harassing Ruming, Daoxian, Ningyuan, and Lingling counties. Our army, led by Liu Jianxu's division and Chen Guangzhong's brigade, is blocking the enemy's advance on the Changning and Qiyang lines. The vanguard of the rebel army has suffered heavy casualties and is retreating towards Ningyuan and Daoxian. We are currently coordinating with friendly forces to encircle and suppress them. (Special telegram from the 31st)</p>
<p>After receiving He Jian's report, Chiang Kai-shek sent a reply of commendation, stating roughly: "You are the pillar of the Party and the nation, and all the officers and soldiers deeply understand righteousness. I am especially pleased that you have issued an order to all division and brigade commanders to maintain steadfastness and swear to kill the enemy. I await news of your victory." (Special telegram from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Northern Party and Government Problems</h3>
<p>Joint Military, Political, and Party Conference to be Convened</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo Telegraphed Urging Wang Jingwei to Go North and Preside</p>
<p>According to a certain important person in Peiping, the provisional government to be produced by the joint military, political, and party conference has been proposed by the armies on all sides. The military side will be responsible for this. The political side will include the chairmen of the provinces and senior officials of several northern provinces. The party side will include senior party members with historical experience who are respected by the armies on all sides. These three types of important figures will jointly convene the conference to produce the provisional government. However, Yan Xishan believes that the government should be produced by the Party headquarters to avoid criticism. Zhao Daiwen also believes that the government should be produced by the Party headquarters to avoid giving cause for criticism. (Special telegram from the 31st)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Sickbed of Europe</h3>
<p>Frenchman Poincaré published an article commenting on Briand's proposed European Federation plan as the sickbed of Europe, saying that it can only comfort but not cure its illness. Because Europe is a place of the fiercest competition, the greatest independence and freedom, and also the greatest mutual suspicion and animosity, it is incredibly difficult to unite it into a federation. Even if various political systems are left to each country's freedom, how can one eliminate all competition, suspicion, and hatred? If that could be achieved, then Europe would have been a peaceful and harmonious place long ago, and there would be no need for a federation.</p>
<p>It is not only in Europe that everything is so. All plans for peace and harmony today are dreams on a sickbed. Everyone has a competitive heart, harbors suspicions, and holds hatred. They reluctantly coexist peacefully when no opportunity arises. Once trouble strikes, they all take the opportunity to seek their own ends. Although the naval agreements of the three major powers have been reached, voices of discontent are constantly emerging in their countries. This also shows that they can only be temporary and not lasting.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is not only in international politics that this is the case. Looking at the world economy, after the devastation of the European war, manufacturing capacity has increased daily, while purchasing power has decreased, commerce has declined, and unemployment has increased. Although people in various countries have exhausted all methods to try to remedy the situation, most of these are temporary and localized measures that soon revert to their former state and even worsen. These are also mostly dreams on a sickbed, merely comforting for a time but not addressing the true illness.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams II</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei in Peiping sent a telegram to Chen Gongbo, praising Yan Xishan and Zhao Daiwen for their willingness to go north. (Special telegram from the 30th)</p>
<p>The Peiping Evening News reported that the Party Affairs Rectification Committee convened a meeting to create a new government and telegraphed the military delegation proposing to convene a joint military, political, and party conference to form a government because the long-standing problems of the Party had delayed military and government affairs. (Special telegram from the 31st)</p>
<p>The Peiping New Morning Post reported that Chen Gongbo left Peiping for the Western Hills yesterday. (Special telegram from the 30th)</p>
<p>Tao Yegong went to Shijiazhuang yesterday to visit Yan Xishan and report on the mediation of Party affairs. (Special telegram from the 30th)</p>
<p>This morning in Peiping, Zhao Bilian visited Chen Gongbo again. Tan Zhen and others hope to convene a Party meeting soon. Chen Gongbo telegraphed urging Wang Jingwei to come personally to preside. As for the draft of the public telegram declaration, the names of those who sign it should also be telegraphed to for their consent. Personal names in the telegram should at least have the person's consent. Please telegraph them separately for their responses before sending the final version for more sincerity. Zhao said that the situation is urgent and it is impossible to seek everyone's reply one by one. Everyone should obey the overall Party instructions, so it doesn't matter whether they telegraph or not; what is sent out will be the law. Wang Faqin said that if the wording is general, all parties should have no problem. If the wording is like the current wording, it is somewhat inconsistent with the positions of the parties. It is better to be down-to-earth. Therefore, Zhao requested that the provincial government and Party affairs meetings first convene a preparatory meeting. Tan Zou, Xie and others all agreed to convene the meeting quickly, issue a declaration quickly, form an expanded central government quickly, and form a government quickly. (Special telegram from the 30th)</p>
<h3>Qi Dong Jin Army Disarmed</h3>
<p>Yan Xishan Convened Meeting in Dezhou</p>

<p>Han Fuju telegraphed Wu Zhenzhuan, President of the Henan High Court in Nanjing, saying that Bianyuan will soon be recovered. He has been ordered to reassume control of the Henan government. Zhang Boying has already gone to Guide to reorganize the provincial government. He requests that you continue to serve as President of the High Court and hopes that you will take office as soon as possible. (31st) Yan Xishan secretly went to Dezhou on the Jinpu line on the 27th and convened the highest military conference with Fu Zuoyi, Zhang Yinwu, Li Fuying, Wang Jingguo, Li Shengda, and others.

<p>The Training Office for Loyal Soldiers at the Headquarters in Nanjing received a telegram from the front stating that the second batch of over two thousand captured officers and soldiers is scheduled to arrive on the morning of the 1st. They will be incorporated into the first and second battalions to step up training. (Special telegram from the 31st)</p>
<p>Adjutant Li of the Provisional First Division in Bengbu escorted over 300 prisoners by train to Bengbu and handed them over to the prisoner management office to be sent to the Nan Camp. Chang Jiangqi, the director of the First Rear Hospital here, was ordered to survey and determine the seventh barracks in Xiaoyue South as the residence for the wounded soldiers, which can accommodate thousands of people. (Special telegram from the 30th)</p>
<h3>Second Mongolian Conference</h3>

<p>The Mongolian Conference in Nanjing held its second session at the Lizi Society at 3 pm on the 30th. Seven members of the presidium, including Ma Fuxiang, and 53 delegates were present, with 18 observers. Yuan Qing'en presided over the meeting.

<p>Outline of measures for the fiscal administration of the League and Banner. It was resolved to refer it for review together with other cases. The meeting adjourned at 6 pm. (Special telegram from the 33rd)</p>
<p>Zhangjia Hutuktu is one of the religious leaders in Inner Mongolia. The Central Government convened the Mongolian Conference to resolve all political issues. Because Zhangjia has religious power but no political power, he was not summoned. Zhangjia telegraphed a statement of reasons requesting participation, which was permitted by Vice Chairman Ma of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission, who sent several temporary representatives.

<p>Important International News</p>
<h3>Indian Governor Issues Two Ordinances</h3>
<p>Suppressing Incitement to Tax Resistance</p>
<p>Prohibiting Intimidation</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 30th: The Indian Governor today promulgated two ordinances. The first prohibits inciting taxpayers to refuse to pay taxes, as the All-India Congress has resolved to launch a non-tax payment movement, and the executive committee under Nehru's guidance has decided to urge all sectors to redouble their efforts while Gandhi is imprisoned to achieve their common goals and carry out a non-tax payment, salt manufacturing, alcohol prohibition, and boycott of British merchants movement. The Indian government stated that taxes should be paid, and the government will never tolerate non-payment. This law is applicable to prevent incitement to refuse to pay taxes on political grounds. The second prohibits intimidation, and all acts of harassment and various forms of intimidation are prohibited. The government stated that it is common for people to use this intimidation method to prevent the sale of foreign goods or alcohol. Promoting the purchase of domestic goods is legitimate, and persuading people to abstain from alcohol is commendable, but using intimidation is illegal. Actions such as forcing public servants to resign or abandon their posts and excluding government personnel are particularly egregious. However, legitimate efforts to encourage local businesses and genuine labor disputes unrelated to politics are not subject to this law. The above two laws will be implemented in the Bombay province, and it is stipulated that violators will be imprisoned for six months and fined depending on the severity of the case.</p>

<h3>Revolutionary Atmosphere in Vietnam Thickens</h3>

In Chazhao, 125 miles northwest of Saigon, a thousand demonstrators clashed with police, resulting in three deaths and two injuries among the Vietnamese. The demonstrators raised poles and knives, with those carrying flags inscribed with (No Tax Payment) leading the way. When the police attempted to arrest the flag bearers, the crowd clamored and attacked with bamboo poles. The police opened fire, and the crowd scattered. It is estimated that there are still wounded hiding in the rice fields. The police found Soviet hammer and sickle symbols on the bodies of the dead and wounded. There were also demonstrations in the Amang district of Kangsu province. A local official was surrounded by fifteen people. His entourage fired into the air to break the siege and escape. Fifteen demonstrators were arrested.</p>

<h3>Europe's Sickbed</h3>
<p>Dreams and Reality Must Not Be Confused</p>
<p>Expressing Doubt About the Federation Plan</p>
<p>Former French Prime Minister Publishes an Article</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 30th: Today, Poincaré published an article in the independent newspaper Excelsiei titled "Europe's Sickbed," expressing doubts about Briand's plan to establish a European Federation. It stated that the replies from European countries that received Briand's memorandum must be humble and polite, but overall they are not encouraging. What is clear and undeniable is that even if Europe has this organization, it must go through many stages to reach the goal envisioned by Briand. Whether Russia and England can join this federation is still a question. He determined that England will stand outside the United States of Europe due to its status as a world empire. France will be in an even more difficult position because the French parliament has colonial representatives who can question the government about events that occur in the European Federation. In short, even if Briand's desire for lasting peace is extremely sincere, dreams and reality must not be confused.</p>
<h3>US Naval Appropriation Bill</h3>

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Decides Attitude on Naval Issues</h3>
<p>Considered a Naval Department Issue</p>
<p>To Be Handled by Finance Minister Alone</p>
<p>Struggle for Command</p>
<p>Government Makes Concessions</p>
<p>Navy Minister in a Dilemma</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication, Tokyo, 31st: The Japanese government decided at yesterday's cabinet meeting to treat issues related to the navy as an internal matter of the Navy Department and to leave everything to be handled by the Finance Minister and the Navy Minister. The Navy Minister reported in detail at the meeting on the exchange of views with Military Councillor Kato and the Chief of the Naval General Staff.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication, Tokyo, 30th: The Military Councillors' meeting held at the Navy Minister's residence yesterday decided that Minister Kato's opinion was appropriate. The government's permission to send a return training at that time, without prior agreement with the military department responsible for national defense and military operations, was inappropriate. Everyone, including Marshal Togo, believes in Minister Kato's opinion. However, this issue is quite significant, and there are reports that it will be submitted to the Privy Council. In short, although the navy's opinion is unified, the Finance Minister, being a member of the cabinet, must implement the government's views. How can the Navy Minister, in his capacity as Minister of the Military Department, convey the navy's views to the government? This is why the Navy Minister is in a dilemma.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication, Tokyo, 31st: The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun writes that from now on, regarding the negotiations on supplementing the deficiency of military strength, the government says it has left everything to the Navy Minister. The Naval General Staff, after careful study of the shortage of submarines and other issues, will submit a proposal to the Military Councillors' meeting. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun writes that although the government has made concessions to the military department's issues, the Privy Council still regards the government's actions as a serious mistake in disrespecting the military department, so it attaches great importance to it. The Hochi Shimbun writes that the Navy Minister has also admitted that there are inconveniences in the handling of affairs, but the Navy Minister once said that the Councillors' meeting only discussed military department issues and did not discuss those related to the government. The Kokumin Shimbun says that the misunderstanding arose because the Navy Minister was not present. Now that the Navy Minister has returned to the country, everything is clear and there are no more problems. The government side is optimistic about this. The Jiji Shimpo writes that it is reported that the military department has said everything it needs to say, and will now remain silent and await the final judgment of the Privy Council.</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>borne by the local governments. In addition, the maintenance allowance for children from poor families will require approximately £3 million per year.</p>
<p>Also, when the bill passed its second reading yesterday, Education Minister Trevelyan stated that it concerns 500,000 children each year. The government wants children to enter the workforce a year later, which will free up jobs to accommodate 100,000 to 150,000 adults. Furthermore, if children study for an additional year, 8,000 more teachers can be employed, which will also help accommodate the unemployed. Children from poor families will receive separate support for their maintenance expenses during their extra year in school. Conservative Party member Peake opposed the bill, stating that it contains coercive elements.</p>

<h3>Central Government Holds May 30th Commemoration</h3>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held a meeting at 6:00 AM on the 30th to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the May 30th Massacre, a national day of shame. Attendees included Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Tan Yankai, Wang Chonghui, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Wang Boqun, Jiao Yitang, staff members, and guests, totaling several hundred people. After the opening ceremony, Chairman Hu Hanmin gave a report stating: "Today, we commemorate the national shame of the English imperialists in Shanghai who, in the 14th year of the Republic, shot and killed our compatriots. At that time, our workers were striking due to mistreatment by foreigners. After Gu Zhenghong was killed, patriotic workers and comrades of our party decided to hold a parade and give speeches today. English police immediately opened fire, injuring and killing dozens of people. After this incident, anti-imperialist movements arose throughout the country. At the same time, foreigners used the same methods to deal with the Shameen Massacre. The English used machine guns and cannons to slaughter our unarmed people. From this, we know that for a long time, foreigners have not regarded Chinese people as human beings, thinking that killing a few people is not a big deal. They even used their ultimate means to kill many people without taking responsibility. They used unequal treaties to create their evil power. The late Premier said that China has fallen to a state worse than a semi-colony, even worse than a colony, which is truly accurate. Imperialists still know how to cherish their colonies and are unwilling to kill them, but they do not treat semi-colonies that way. Moreover, the imperialist countries have formed a united front against China, oppressing and slaughtering us in a coordinated manner. Five years have passed, and the imperialist countries and their people also know that this kind of imperialism is no longer applicable to China. China is on the road to completing the National Revolution and cannot be dealt with by their gunboat policy. The significance of our commemoration today is not only to mourn the tragic deaths of our compatriots and comrades, but also because they died fighting against the imperialists. We, the survivors, have the responsibility to strive to abolish the unequal treaties, which are the amulets relied upon by foreigners. Because of the concessions and extraterritorial rights, even murderers cannot be held accountable. We should especially know to work hard so that such things will never happen again and to overthrow the foundation of the imperialists. Only in this way can we commemorate the martyrs. The late Premier's instructions teach us to abolish the unequal treaties, and we are also working in this direction, while the warlords are deliberately undermining and disrupting this effort, acting as tools for the imperialists and complementing each other. The two rebels, Yan and Feng, are now even bringing in imperialism. We must eliminate these tools of the imperialists in order to achieve the goal of abolishing the treaties. After this May 30th, the mentality of the Chinese people is different from before. After eliminating the warlords, we must take more responsibility for reconstruction. The late Premier said that the purpose of attacking Cao and Wu was to prevent anyone from rising up to replace them. Today, the purpose of attacking Yan and Feng must also be to prevent anyone from rising up to replace them, and we must completely eliminate the causes that produce Yan and Feng. At the same time, we must clarify internal affairs, engage in people's livelihood construction, and eliminate the tools upon which warlords rely for survival. This is the work we should do for the revolution, and only in this way can we be worthy of the martyrs." Next, Wang Chonghui gave a speech, saying, "Mr. Hu has already reported in detail on the significance of commemorating the May 30th Massacre. I would like to add a few words. When the massacre occurred, I was abroad. At first, the newspapers of various countries only published one or two lines about it each day. Later, articles about strikes and various movements gradually increased. When the photos were published, they looked like a battlefield at first glance, but it was actually Nanjing Road in Shanghai, China. Afterwards, the United States sent a judge to Shanghai to investigate the cause of this case, but the Chinese refused to participate because the facts were obvious and did not need to be investigated. The report of his research has not yet been published. The crime of the police opening fire is not only due to the order of one or two foreigners, but the real reason is that they have always looked down on the Chinese. There is also a fundamental conflict of ideology. At that time, the order issued by the police was 'shoot to kill.' They did not know that the spirit of our nation cannot be killed with guns. The ancients said that knowing shame is close to courage. We now know shame, but it is not true courage. We must be able to wipe out the shame to be true courage." After Mr. Wang's report, the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>He Jian Personally Goes to the Front to Supervise the Battle</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After Tang Shengming and others colluded with Zhang Guijun to invade Hunan, the four-route commander-in-chief, He Jian, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered the front lines to block and intercept the enemy. At the same time, he transferred a portion of the troops in Hunan responsible for suppression to join the effort and appointed Liu Yinggu, chief of staff of the 15th Division, Cao Bowen, director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Yu Xiangsan, director of education at the Regiment Defense Training Institute, as supervisors to go to the front and oversee the battle. He has been extremely busy dispatching troops in recent days. The various units have concentrated at designated locations and are about to begin contact. According to a telegram from Commander Liu Jianxu, the enemy troops entering Hunan through Longhuguan consist of approximately 1,000 soldiers from Liang Chongxi's 7th Division, 7,000 soldiers from Yang Tenghui, and 3,000 soldiers from Tang Zheming. Those entering Hunan through Quanzhou via Huangsha River consist of approximately 4,000 soldiers from Zhang Fakui's unit. It is reported that Li Zongren entered Hunan from Dong'an, but it is unknown which unit he is leading. The total strength of the enemy is no more than 20,000 soldiers, etc. Commander-in-Chief He believes that the front-line deployment of our army has been completed. In order to quickly seize the opportunity, he departed from the province this morning at 5:00 AM to personally go to Hengzhou to supervise the army's advance and suppression. All duties of the chairman of the provincial government will be performed by Committee Member Song Hegeng, which has been reported to the Central Government yesterday. (28th)</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Yongxing Company Preparatory Office</h3>
<p>Important Announcement from the Founders</p>
<p>The Preparatory Office No Longer Exists</p>
<p>The Construction Committee previously issued electrical bonds to reorganize and expand the two power plants in the capital and Qishuyan. All procedures had been completed when a self-proclaimed Yongxing Electrical Company Preparatory Office published an announcement to obstruct the process. The details of this situation have been briefly reported in various newspapers. Now, it is learned that the Construction Committee has submitted a report to the Executive Yuan for recordation regarding the takeover of the Zhenhua Power Plant, which has been approved. The regulations for issuing electrical bonds have also been promulgated by the National Government. Since the takeover, on the one hand, the value of the shares and bonds has been verified and returned, and on the other hand, active reorganization and expansion have been undertaken. All of the more than 1.3 million Zhenhua shares have been collected and destroyed, and all outstanding debts have been paid off. There are no legal issues. The actions of the Preparatory Office are nothing more than being manipulated by a few inferior individuals who vainly hope to undermine the credit of the bonds, and it is inevitable that reactionary elements will take the opportunity to stir up trouble. Therefore, the Jiangsu Provincial Government was consulted to order Wuxi County to close the Preparatory Office. On May 20th, Shanghai Shen Xin and other newspapers published an important announcement from the founders of the Yongxing Company Preparatory Office, including Lu Bohong, Zhang Yunbo, Li Mengzhou, and Ye Shaozhang, stating that the Zhenhua Electric Machinery Factory had previously signed a contract with the Wuxi Yaoming Electric Company to merge and establish the Yongxing Preparatory Office, and they had been appointed as the founders. After the Construction Committee took over, the Preparatory Office had already been canceled in compliance with the order. Now, some people are still using the name of the Preparatory Office to engage in various activities. They stated that they had not been consulted beforehand and would not be responsible for anything. Therefore, the Yongxing Preparatory Office no longer exists, and those who are still using the name of the Preparatory Office to publish announcements are nothing more than a few people stirring up trouble on the pretext. The truth has already been revealed. It is now reported that after the Jiangsu Provincial Government received the consultation from the Construction Committee, it immediately instructed the Wuxi County Government to investigate and deal strictly with the person in charge of the self-proclaimed Yongxing Preparatory Office.</p>

<h3>Resolution of the Shantou Market Strike</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The municipal government levied an additional 20% donation on electricity bills. The General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the National Government and the Provincial Government to request a temporary suspension of the execution, but the municipal government still implemented the levy, resulting in a city-wide strike that began on the 22nd. At 1:00 PM that afternoon, the General Chamber of Commerce convened the sixth emergency meeting, nominating Chen Jingqing, Ma Zonghan, and Shi Ziqin to meet with Civil Affairs Inspector Huang Zungeng, and nominating Xu Wanru, Li Xiangkun, and Chen Chengwen to meet with Dai Ji, the brigade commander of the 61st Division. Yang Jianping, the Customs Superintendent, and Huang Zungeng, the Civil Affairs Inspector, mediated separately, and a resolution was reached immediately. The General Chamber of Commerce then announced the resumption of business for all stores by gong, and announced the mediation measures to be followed: (1) The request to completely abolish the additional 10-20% donation on electricity bills was agreed upon. It was stipulated that Yang and Huang would negotiate the abolition, and before the resolution, the municipal government could not collect it from the citizens and Yang and Huang would be responsible for the thorough abolition.

The next day (23rd), all stores in the city resumed their old appearance. (May 23rd)</p>
<h3>Closure of the Hujiatan Breach on the Yellow River in Shandong</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Hujiatan breach on the north bank of the lower reaches of the Yellow River in Lijin County was breached in the spring of the 17th year of the Republic. In the summer of the 18th year of the Republic, the provincial government spent 300,000 yuan but failed to close it. This spring, it was closed again, with an estimated cost of 119,000 yuan. However, soon after construction began, military affairs occurred in the area, making the project quite difficult. Fortunately, no matter which side the troops were on, they did not interfere with the closure project. The closure project started on the 24th and was completed. Because the banks of the Yellow River have become military areas, the report telegram arrived only yesterday (28th). The original text is as follows: (2) River Affairs Bureau Director Liu Junjian: At the time of Gengzi, the upper and lower corners of the beach point in the shallow water of the east dam were successively infested, leveling with the water. The upper corner of the beach point on the west dam was trapped by three feet. He immediately supervised the civil and military officials, soldiers, and laborers to add earth materials separately. At the time of Chen, the west dam began to stabilize. However, as the east dam was added, it was also trapped. By the time of noon, it was slightly calmer. Unexpectedly, the east wind supported the rapid current and the water rose by six inches. The depth of the breach increased from one zhang to one zhang eight or nine chi. He Nian and others, seeing the dangerous situation, were afraid that repeated scouring and protection would delay the opportunity. They immediately discussed with Committee Member Sun of the River Works Committee to occupy and close the breach at the time of Wei. Just as the material was being pressed and the earth was being swept, the wind became stronger and the water rose again. The difference between the water level before and after the sweep was four or five chi. The current in the breach was turbulent and dangerous. At the time of Xishi, the occupied sweep reached the bottom, and the back river sweep's eyes turned over and surged abnormally. Fortunately, the soldiers and laborers were brave, and the materials were available. On the one hand, they rushed to buy soil materials with cash and built a back dike. On the other hand, they transported and threw cattails and earth bags to block the sweep's eyes. By the time of Xu, the outflow gradually decreased, and the full period of drainage could be cut off in a few hours. Unexpectedly, a storm broke out, and the river water rose by more than two chi. Leaks appeared frequently in the occupied closure, and this blockage collapsed. All the workers, avoiding difficulties and dangers, were rushing to plug the gaps in the rain when a second new ditch was added. The fronts of the dikes of each project were all exposed to the water, and the wind and waves hit them at the same time. The protection was divided, but fortunately it was safe. Up to now, at the time of Chou, the leaks in the closure have gradually decreased, but the curtain water seepage has not stopped. It is estimated that the air can be closed at the time of noon. At this moment, we are still rushing to buy soil materials with cash to help the back dike to ensure safety and to avoid danger. Knocking from the breach closure project at Yin (2). Director Liu Junjian of the River Affairs Bureau, Ke Yin, please see the obstruction. Ke Yin's telegram should invite your perusal. The back dike at the closure continues to be rushed to be strengthened and soil is purchased with cash to actively surround the dike, and to use sacks of soil and yellow material to plug the leaks at any time. Up to the time of Wei, it is estimated that the rear dike has a width of about four zhang. All curtain water seepage has been completely cut off. After the closure of the air, in addition to increasing the height of each shallow water field, which has been completed for the past two months, we continue to rush to buy soil materials with cash to cultivate the dikes and protect them. I hereby report this telegram to you for your consideration. Knocking from the breach closure project.</p>
<h3>Tragic Murder Case at Hongde Silver Shop in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Five Young Men in the Shop Were Killed</p>
<p>The Murderer Committed Suicide After the Murder, but Did Not Die</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: A tragic murder case suddenly occurred at the Hongde Silver Shop at 165 Queen's Road Central in Hong Kong at 4:30 AM yesterday. People in Hong Kong were shocked when they heard about it. It is understood that the murderer in this case was a former employee of the silver shop several years ago. He recently came to Hong Kong from his hometown and stayed at the silver shop. As for why he committed this brutal act, opinions vary. Now, the information gathered from various sources is described as follows:</p>
<p>The case occurred at the silver shop, which rents a four-story building. The second floor is the office of the chief manager, the third floor is the office of the deputy manager, and the fourth floor is where the partners live. There is also a kitchen on the fourth floor. After nightfall, the partners live on different floors. The chief and deputy managers are not in the shop, but they have several young sons who stay in the shop so they can go to school in the morning. The murderer arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago and stayed in the living room on the third floor last night. There are two rooms on that floor, and all the students were in the rooms. At 4:30 yesterday morning, screams for help were suddenly heard on the second and third floors of the shop. The partners in the shop were startled and immediately pressed the alarm bell in the shop. The central police station also received the news. At that time, everyone thought there was a fire and came out to see. Shortly after, the central police station dispatched a rapid response team by car and learned that a tragic murder case had occurred at the shop.</p>
<p>Police Investigation: At that time, the area around Hongde Silver Shop was surrounded by onlookers. Chinese, English, and Indian detectives rushed to the scene and cordoned off the surrounding area for investigation. At that time, traffic was temporarily cut off from Yongji Street in the east to Yonghe Street in the west. The police went up to each floor to investigate and found a corpse lying on a couch in the hall on the second floor, covered in blood. The hands were on the ground, and blood was still spurting from the throat. They then proceeded to the third floor and found four corpses lying in pools of blood, all in the two rooms on the third floor. Bloodstains were everywhere on the floor, and the sundries in the two rooms were stained red. Upon closer inspection, the fatal wounds on each of the four bodies were on the throat. In addition, one young man was seriously injured, and the murderer, Li Wen, also committed suicide and fell to the ground. An ambulance was called to the scene and the injured were sent to the National Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Details of the Murder: When the murderer committed the murder, everyone was asleep. It is estimated that there were a total of twenty people sleeping in the shop. Early that morning, the murderer secretly went up to the kitchen on the fourth floor and obtained four kitchen knives. He first went down to the third floor to commit the murder. At that time, in addition to the shop owner's sons, there were also several partners in the shop. The murderer brutally attacked the shop owner's sons. Because his methods were quick and decisive, he killed them with a single knife. Therefore, when he committed the murder on the third floor, although several lives were taken, no one knew about it. After the murderer brutally killed the young men on the third floor, he continued down to the second floor and killed Feng Xizhuo, the son of the chief manager. When Feng was attacked, his throat was cut and he could not make a sound. He struggled for a short time and then died. The murderer then slashed at Cheng Huiyu's young son, Cheng Zuhui. Cheng cried out in pain, and this tragedy was finally heard by everyone. The cook resisted the murderer: The partners heard the cries for help and got up to see what was happening. At that time, they saw the cook, Liu Yitian, standing in front of the murderer. The murderer, Li Wen, raised the knife and committed suicide, injuring his clothing. He then raised the knife and slashed at himself. The cook, Liu Yitian, stepped forward to resist and forcibly snatched the knife from him. The murderer then fell to the ground, blood gushing out. The partners rushed forward to examine him and saw that the murderer was still clutching the kitchen knife, which was covered in red. At that time, everyone thought the murderer was dead, but later they learned that he was still breathing.</p>
<p>Cause of the Case: After the incident, the reporter went to the shop to interview. According to the shop owner, Feng Yixi, the murderer was a former employee of the shop several years ago. He recently came to Hong Kong from his hometown and stayed at the shop. The day before this case occurred, the murderer said he had no job and was wandering around all day and decided to return home. Feng told him to stay a few more days. At that time, the murderer's intention to return home was very firm. He immediately took his luggage and left, but unexpectedly returned to the shop that night. The murderer had no quarrel with the five murdered men and the young master who was slashed, nor did he have any other incidents. Although the murderer was the concubine's uncle of Cheng Huiquan, the deputy manager of the shop, the tragic case was not related to Cheng personally. No one in the shop knew what caused the murderer to commit the crime. He had been in charge of the shop for several years without any incidents. The purpose of his murder was probably not to rob the shop of money. At that time, no one saw him take any other actions, only that he committed suicide.</p>
<p>Names of the Dead and Injured: It is understood that a total of five people died in this case, one was injured, and the murderer was injured. The names are as follows: (1) Feng Xizhuo, 19 years old, from Jiujiang Shiwan, Nanhai, and son of the manager Feng Litang. He studied at Wah Yan College and was killed on the second floor. (2) Cheng Zubei, 15 years old, from Jiujiang, suffered serious head injuries and died on the spot. (3) Cheng Pan, 14 years old, from Jiujiang, suffered head and chest injuries and died in the ambulance on the way. The two individuals in items one, two and three are the sons of the deputy manager Cheng Huiquan. (4) Cheng Yongjie, 14 years old, from Jiujiang, suffered head injuries and died on the spot. (5) Cheng Yongyuan, 13 years old, suffered head injuries and died on the spot. The individuals in items four and five are the sons of the buyer, Cheng Dizhi. (6) Cheng Zuhui, 16 years old, suffered body injuries and is currently hospitalized. (7) Murderer Li Wen, 27 years old, cut his own throat and was injured. (25th)</p>

However, the injuries of Shen Songqing and his son are very serious and their lives are in danger. Furthermore, the Fengjing Joint Defense Office previously destroyed a bandit den at the junction of Songjiang and Qingpu counties, rescued hostage Wu Guoqing, captured bandits Feng Youcai and Shen Zhuqing, and seized three rifles and one bandit boat. It is now heard that the office interrogated bandits Feng Youcai and others, who confessed that Li Fuqing was the bandit leader, there were more than 20 people in the gang, they had 12 guns, and they were hired to guard Wu, and that they knew nothing about the rest. After interrogation, they prepared a document and sent it to the Shanghai Garrison Command for legal action. A fugitive police officer was captured and escorted back to the county. Yuan Zhenxian, a policeman from the second squadron of the county police team, was from Fuyang, Zhejiang. He had been with the team for only a short time. On the 19th, while on patrol, he claimed to need to urinate, took his gun and escaped. The team searched for him but could not find him. His guarantor, Ma Liansheng, was ordered to surrender him and a wanted notice was issued. It is now learned that a fellow villager of Yuan's from the team secretly went to Fuyang to investigate and found Yuan back in Fuyang, eating noodles in a noodle shop. He was immediately arrested and sent to Squadron Leader Song Yin of Songjiang on the 30th. According to Yuan Zhenxian's confession, the Mauser gun had been sold for 105 yuan. The squadron leader punished Yuan for violating military discipline and beat him with military sticks, and then sent him to the county government for punishment.</p>
<p>Bandits Set Fire to Wuxutou: Since the bandit Tai Bao Ashu occupied Qianjiawei and the surrounding area in Nanxiang, all those with some wealth have sought to move away. It is heard that bandits set fire to Wuxutou the night before last. Wuxutou is about two li from Langxia. Although it is not a market town, the houses are well-organized, which is rare in the countryside. Many wealthy people have moved away, but He Lansheng's family is in modest circumstances. He had previously received a letter from the bandits demanding 10,000 yuan. After receiving the letter, He left home to avoid them, but he had no way to respond, which angered the bandits. The night before last, they prepared several cans of kerosene and set fire to his entire family, turning it into ruins, and also affecting the Zou family, causing them considerable losses.</p>
<h3>Jinshan</h3>
<p>Bandits Gathered to Rob Jinshan Nanxiang: Tai Bao Ashu, who gathered bandits from Jiajiawei Bridge in Nanxiang, Jinshan, has repeatedly robbed important towns in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Since Zhejiang troops have repeatedly searched and suppressed the area, they once fled into Taihu Lake. When the Taihu Bandit Suppression Command was established and guarded the important passes, they could not succeed and planned to change their route back to their lair. They passed through Chenmu and were spotted by Su troops who launched a head-on attack. All of the more than 20 bandit ships were sunk. It is heard that the stolen goods on the ships were worth a great deal of money. They then fled back to their old lair, and many of their gang members returned. Fearing that Zhejiang troops would come to search and suppress them again, on the 16th of this month, Tai Bao Ashu went to the Langxia district to drive out the abbot of the Jizi Nunnery and used it as their headquarters. Every night, they gave speeches in the nunnery. It seems that they have an organized secretariat, which is reportedly managed by Yan Shusheng. There are a total of about 300 bandits. A branch office was set up at the north end of Shantang, which is managed by the second leader, Zhuluo Aimei. Many wealthy families in the area have received letters of extortion. Now, those who are said to have assets in the surrounding area have moved away. The bandits call themselves the Songhu Guerrilla Team.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Imprisonment of Father's Concubine Causes Lawsuit: A few days ago, it was rumored in the teahouses and wineries of Nanqiao that Zhuang Jieqing, a resident of Nanjie, had abused his father's concubine and privately imprisoned her. At the same time, his neighbor, surnamed Wang, told the former director of the Songzhang Water and Land Salt Smuggling Bureau, Li Tianmin, the facts he had witnessed and asked him to help rescue her. Li, feeling that justice could not be denied, reported it to the First District Office. District Chief Jiang Rongchu sent a letter to the County Public Security Bureau Director Li, who dispatched inspectors Tan and Chen to intervene. However, Zhuang's house was deep and far away, making it impossible to investigate. They replied stating the matter was well-founded and should be handled. Now it is learned that Zhuang has accused Li in court of fabricating facts and falsely accusing him, intending to defraud him. Li, although the matter does not concern him, is unwilling to show weakness to protect humanity. A craftsman who made the wooden prisoner testified as a witness and filed a counter-suit the day before yesterday. Magistrate Shen has scheduled a court hearing for June 5th. It is thought that the truth of the case will not be difficult to reveal at that time.</p>
<p>Yinglong Temple Reported Another Theft: There have been more than 20 theft cases of various sizes in the county, and most of the incidents have occurred in the area where Songjiang, Jinshan, Nanqiao, and Fengxian counties border each other. Last night, at 9:00 PM, bandits carried out a robbery in Yinglongmiao Town, which is located on the Song-Feng border. The town has no defense and is a rural market town that counties cannot resist. When Petty Officer Bu of the Ruanxiang police team reported the incident, the police squad leader, Yang Xingsheng, went to encircle and suppress them, but they had already fled far away. It was found that five families in Fengjing and two families in Songjing had been robbed, each losing about two or three hundred yuan. The County Government sent a judicial clerk to the village yesterday to investigate the robbery cases in the 39th district, including the families of Chen and Xia. In the case of Xi Yusun's family in Zhangjiatang, the already captured thieves were brought together to have the victims identify them yesterday evening, and they were sentenced to imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Justice has commissioned an investigation into the Jiangsu Third Branch Prison on Sijian Lane and the High Court Detention Center, where incidents of prison riots have occurred, and someone has allegedly been distributing leaflets outside detailing the alleged oppression of prisoners by the guards. The Ministry of Judicial Administration also received these leaflets. Therefore, on the 30th, they specifically appointed Section Chief Liao to come to Suzhou to join Secretary Ni of the High Court in investigating the situation at the prison.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Military Affairs has telegraphed orders to prepare a rear hospital. The county government received a telegram yesterday from the Commander-in-Chief and the Ministry of Military Affairs stating that due to the wounded soldiers at the front lines, they plan to transport them to Suzhou for treatment. They were instructed to find buildings capable of accommodating more than 1,000 people and to prepare a rear hospital with medical personnel, and to order the police to be responsible for escorting and guarding the wounded soldiers upon their arrival. After receiving the telegram, County Magistrate Huang immediately summoned Presidents Wu and Zhang of the county hospital to discuss and scheduled a meeting of various agencies in three days to prepare.</p>
<p>A Central Investigator Commits Suicide in Suzhou. Zhong Shicai, a 24-year-old investigator from the Central Headquarters of the Capital Kuomintang, arrived in Suzhou on the afternoon of the 29th with two pieces of luggage. He stayed in room 30 of the Wujun Hotel outside Changmen, wearing a Western suit. He showed no signs of distress that evening, but his pockets were empty. The next day, Zhong took a Western-style overcoat to a pawn shop to raise funds for expenses. However, because Suzhou pawn shops generally do not accept Western suits, Zhong returned to the hotel feeling depressed. The hotel accountant, Pu Yiyun, then lent him one dollar. Zhong used the money to buy a bottle of Huadiao wine outside in the evening, returned to the hotel, drank only one-third of it, and went to sleep. Yesterday morning (the 31st) at around 9 a.m., the tea server Xu Changsheng opened the door when Zhong still hadn't gotten up and saw Zhong soundly asleep, heard him breathing continuously, and noticed white foam coming from his mouth. Knowing something was wrong, he reported to the head accountant, Pu Yiyun. Pu immediately hired a car to send Zhong to the Xiao Yong Hospital for treatment. Two empty bottles of tranquilizer pills were found in the room. After Zhong was sent to the hospital, Dr. Gu Suyong injected him with a rescue antidote, but he was still not out of danger. A suicide note was found beside him, stating: "I am a disciple of the Premier and a student of Whampoa. I am not disheartened by setbacks, and I also know that those who take revolution as their profession must maintain an optimistic attitude at all times and in all places. I wanted to resume military life and strive to kill the enemy as the vanguard for the people, but I was unable to fulfill my wish due to illness. My body is full of sins, and redemption is impossible. Everyone has their own aspirations, and no one should be forced," and so on. Pu Yiyun of the hotel, knowing that Zhong was an investigator from the Central Kuomintang Headquarters, immediately telegraphed the Central Kuomintang Headquarters to send someone to Suzhou to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Multiple Robberies Occur Outside the East Gate. The homes of Fan Yuhai, Fan Lin, Da Fan, Fan Shunfa, and others in Fanjiatang outside the East Gate of Wuyi were robbed of valuables and miscellaneous items the night before last. Yesterday (the 30th), the victims claimed that many of the robbers were familiar faces, but they were afraid of retaliation and dared not report the case. Furthermore, Zhu Lansheng's family in Gaotoufen Village nearby recently sold cocoons for 200 yuan, which was coveted by bandits. On the 28th, 126 yuan and 10 jiao of the remaining cocoon money in the family were robbed. The victim also did not report the case.</p>
<p>The County Government Sends Police to Investigate a Kidnapping Case. It has been learned that a kidnapping gang was broken up at Shizhutou outside the North Gate of Wuyi. Magistrate Wu, considering the complexity of the case, interrogated victim Liu Jinsheng and others on the 30th, and further questioned the bandits Chao Xingkun and others. He also specifically sent political police and others to the countryside to investigate. The investigation revealed that on the day of the kidnapping, thirteen bandits wearing yellow and black military uniforms went to Tanjia Village and kidnapped the family of Liu Jinsheng. The doors of the three buildings were sealed with wooden boards and nails. The police also brought back a proclamation from the bandit suppression department to the county for review.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Wuxi Prepares to Establish a Continental Bank. Ye Juexiao, the president of the Continental Bank of Shanghai, decided to establish a Wuxi branch in Wuxi to expand business, as the county is densely populated, industry and commerce are thriving, and water and land transportation are convenient. Fang Licun has been appointed as the branch manager. The branch will be located at the original site of Hengyuan Cang Paper Shop on North Tang East Street. Workers are currently being hired to renovate the building, and the official opening is scheduled after the end of the lunar year.</p>
<p>Strange and Suspicious Robbery. Yesterday afternoon at around 1:00 PM, Cao Haochu, a partner at the Lu Hengxing Sand Casting Factory, suddenly went to the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau on Guangqin Road to report that he (Cao claimed) had recently collected 285 yuan in banknotes and over 200 yuan in silver dollars in the Qingyang Township area bordering Cheng and Wuxi. He was walking back to the factory after arriving in Wuxi by boat when he was suddenly stopped by three bandits near Liangba. They silenced him, searched his body, and robbed all the money he had collected. The bandits also fired a handgun, but luckily, it did not hit him, although there were four holes in the sleeve of his left arm. He requested that the police be dispatched to pursue the bandits. After receiving the report, Director Duan of the branch immediately led the police and Cao Haochu to the scene to investigate. Qian Tianxiong, the Inspector General of the Public Security Bureau, Ni Gusheng, the Detective Chief of the Second Water Police District, and Liao Dajin of the Police Brigade Headquarters also rushed to investigate after hearing the news. Residents in the Liangba area claimed that there had been no robberies and that they had not heard any gunshots. After carefully examining the four holes in Cao's sleeve, it was determined that they were not bullet holes, and the circumstances were highly suspicious. Duan, the branch director, took Cao Haochu back to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Two Families Robbed in Tuli Lane. More than ten bandits broke into the home of Tu Meifang, a resident of Tuli Lane in the Third District (Yangming Township), who was engaged in farming, at midnight on the 27th. Meifang and others were already asleep when they heard the noise and were frightened. The bandits threatened them with guns and then searched everywhere for an hour before going to the home of Tu Fuquan next door to rob for about half an hour. They then left with their loot, shouting and screaming. After an investigation, it was found that more than 500 yuan in cocoon money and over 100 yuan in clothing and jewelry had been stolen from the two families, for a total loss of over 600 yuan. The case has been reported to the county for strict investigation.</p>
<p>The Construction Committee Organizes a Five-County Irrigation Area. The Qishuyan Power Plant of the Central Construction Committee covers the counties of Wu and Xi with power lines running through them. More than 560 li of urban and rural areas in the two counties have been electrified, with more than 20 townships using electric power for agricultural irrigation, mostly in the southwest townships of Wujin. Wuxi has been piloting the program for two years, but it has not yet become widespread, with fewer than 10,000 mu using electric pumps for irrigation. Wu Yulin, the director of the power plant, has been striving to promote the program and previously presented a proposal to Zhang Jingjiang, chairman of the Construction Committee, to pilot the first irrigation area in Wuxi, Wujin, and Yixing counties to promote electric pumping and improve farmland irrigation. Chairman Zhang presented the proposal to the Construction Committee, which resolved to approve it and decided to promote electric pumping and operate long-distance trams to facilitate land transportation. After several discussions, it was decided to designate Wuxi, Wujin, Jiangyin, Changshu, and Yixing as an irrigation area and to open long-distance trams on the Yichang Provincial Road and Xicheng Highway to facilitate transportation in the four counties, with the aim of developing agriculture, water conservancy, land transportation, and electricity to the greatest extent possible. The financial issues have been discussed with Chu Minyi, a member of the Construction Committee, and various countries, and it has been decided to allocate a portion of the refunded Boxer Indemnity for operating expenses.</p>
<p>Shocking News of a Collection Agent Shot to Death. A collection agent from a certain store, Mr. Jia (about 30 years old), was returning from the countryside to the city yesterday (the 31st) at around 1:00 PM when he was suddenly shot in the throat by thugs in the Lengdu Bridge area outside the South Gate. He fell to the ground in extreme pain. Xi Laohu, the local Tuba, hired someone to carry the injured man to the Puren Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died near Yangyaowan. The Tuba reported the incident to Director Zhu of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, who dispatched Patrol Captain Cai and Officer Li to investigate. Seventy yuan in banknotes and 18 jiao in bills were found in the victim's left sock. The victim had pockmarks on his face, gold teeth in his mouth, and was wearing a woolen single shirt.

<p>Bank Warehouse Grain Mortgage Case. It was reported that a grain merchant had mortgaged 1,197 shi of rice in the Jiangsu Bank warehouse, which was accused of hoarding for speculation. The county council decided to order the rice to be sold at a reduced price of two yuan per shi. The grain merchant refused and telegraphed the Jiangsu Bank headquarters to the Civil Affairs Department, which ordered the county government to investigate the matter fairly, as grain mortgages were considered a legitimate business, and at a time when rice prices were soaring, rice warehouses were needed to provide relief.</p>
<p>Military and Police Jointly Suppress Sea Bandits in Lüsi. Sea bandits are rampant in the Lüsi area, having recently killed more than 20 male and female hostages and burned many fishing boats.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Yarn Factory Strike. Male and female workers at a yarn factory are demanding that the factory increase the rice subsidy by two jiao per person per day due to the high price of rice. The factory refused the request as being too harsh, and the workers went on strike yesterday (the 30th). Zhong Jianhui and others from the County Kuomintang Restructuring Committee went to the factory outside the North Gate in the morning to mediate and negotiated with worker representatives Ren Ruisheng, Shi Zhao, Da Yuan, Amei, and others without result. However, while they were discussing, most of the workers suddenly entered the city and first went to the county high school to request the use of the auditorium for a meeting, but were rejected by the high school. The workers then went outside and discovered reactionary leaflets scattered everywhere. The workers then went to the stadium to hold a meeting. County Magistrate Li, upon hearing this, immediately led armed police to the stadium to disperse the meeting, citing the martial law imposed during the May Thirtieth Movement. All male and female workers were searched, and Fan Rongyi was detained for tearing up a letter. The phrases were mostly incomprehensible after piecing together the torn letter. Shen Zhangbao and eight other suspects were also detained. County Magistrate Li requested that a platoon of soldiers from the stationed 8th Company of the Military Police assist in searching the house outside the North Gate, but nothing was found. The worker representatives Ren Ruisheng, Li San, Zhao Akun, Sun Huichen, Tang Xijing, Shi Zhao, Liu Ada, and others were detained in the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention and strict interrogation to determine whether they were suspected of being reactionary and the origin of the reactionary printed materials. The County Kuomintang convened a meeting of labor and management to mediate the labor dispute, and the factory agreed to provide subsidized rice within ten days to meet the workers' needs. The armed forces were on special alert last night to prevent any unforeseen events.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Bandit Forces Resurge in Maoshan. On the 24th, a large band of bandits numbering over 100, all wearing straw hats and plain clothes of various colors, and mostly armed with Mauser pistols, along with more than 20 rifles, arrived in the Maoshan area bordering Ju and Danyang and went to the Liufang Palace to plunder at will, shooting and wounding a Daoist priest. They then regrouped, blew their horns, and went down the mountain to rob Xitashan Village in Jintan County, killing the victim, Wang. The bandits are still entrenched in the Xitashan area and are extremely rampant. Yanling Town in our county, which is close to Maoshan, is afraid of disturbances, and the town's public security branch and the business community have taken strict precautions.</p>
<p>Wenchang Pavilion Burned Down. Wenchang Pavilion, located a few dozen steps in front of the Confucius Temple in the west of the city, was a one-story building of exquisite architecture overlooking the pond and was a scenic highlight of the county. Yesterday at 5:00 PM, several children climbed up to enjoy the view and dropped a cigarette butt, causing a fire. Although the fire brigades of various shops made every effort to extinguish the fire, the fire was too fierce, and the entire pavilion was reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>Reactionary Leaflets Discovered in the City. Reactionary leaflets were scattered on the ground in Beicaoxiang and other places in the county yesterday. A student from the Lutaixiang Shoe Store who happened to be passing by bent down to pick them up and was spotted by a guard, who took the student and the leaflets to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Fishing Boats Robbed in Succession. At around 12:00 PM on the 29th, a boat carrying eggs from Gaoyou to Dongguan was robbed by bandits near the South Salt Office north of Wutaishan, who looted all the rice and silver dollars. The boatman, Tang San, unloaded the eggs and left Yangzhou. It was also learned that a fishing boat was robbed in the same area the day before.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Agricultural Hall Prepares for Product Exhibition. The Agricultural Products Exhibition Hall of the Department of Agriculture and Mining is about to open. Although the items collected last year and sent to the West Lake Exposition have been donated to the hall by the producers, they have been left for a long time and are inevitably old and decayed. It is still necessary to sort and replenish them to make them perfect. Therefore, the provincial and county departments were specifically ordered yesterday to select and prepare the latest products, make specimens and designs, and decorate them, and to send them to the province within 20 days after receiving the order for forwarding and display for observation.</p>
<p>Bandits Discovered Again in Gaozi Township. A band of more than 200 bandits suddenly appeared in Wulicun, Gaozi Township, Zhenjiang, at around 8:00 PM yesterday, carrying torches and robbing wildly. The local security team went to encircle and suppress them, but the bandits dared to fire their guns and resist arrest. The two sides exchanged fire for about 20 minutes before the bandits were defeated. The team has telegraphed the provincial authorities, requesting that troops be sent immediately to assist in the suppression to maintain order.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>District Offices to Be Established by a Deadline. The Jiaxing Autonomous Region has been determined, and the entire region will be divided into seven districts. The locations of the district offices have also been determined. It has been learned that the county government has ordered the district chiefs to establish all district offices by June 1. The county government originally planned to allocate the remaining funds from the land survey reports to cover the operating expenses, but the provincial government has ordered the county to report that the review and re-measurement procedures have not yet been carried out, and it cannot be considered that there are any remaining funds at this time. Therefore, the county government telegraphed the County Funds and Property Management Committee yesterday to allocate the previously approved 2,313 yuan and 56 jiao and 6 fen of the county's local public funds to ensure the establishment is completed on schedule.</p>
<p>Investigation of Education Bureau Director Being Sued. Jiaxing Education Bureau Director Ren Xuan was recently accused of fraudulently enticing farmer Ma Deyou from Fenghuangqiao to the bureau under the pretext of a meeting while clearing the school fields, and then illegally detaining Deyou. Ma Deyou then hired Xuan Qugao to file a complaint with the court, accusing Director Ren of illegal detention and obstruction of freedom, and requesting the court to punish him according to the law. It is learned that after receiving the complaint, the local branch of the High Court's Prosecutor's Office sent a letter to the county government to investigate the case and has now received a reply. Therefore, the branch has issued a summons and scheduled the investigation to begin on June 9.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Extort Huge Sums from Zhongjun Town. Zhongjun Town near Linghu, Huzhou, has 50 to 60 pawnshops and shops. The town has been free of bandits since the Taiping Rebellion. Although there have been many bandits in various places in recent years, the town has remained peaceful, and the merchants and residents have lived in peace. Unexpectedly, a certain gentleman in the town recently received a letter from the bandits, borrowing 30,000 yuan to meet their urgent needs, to be delivered at Boshu Temple on the 28th. The person delivering the money must wear a long shirt, carry a rattan basket in his left hand, and hold a cigar in his right hand as a sign. If the money is not delivered by the deadline, a large group will be sent to the town to collect it. The gentleman was extremely alarmed after reading the letter and immediately convened a meeting of merchants and residents. After much deliberation, they submitted a request to the provincial government to send troops to guard the town to prevent unforeseen events.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>The Seawall is in Danger During the Plum Rains. The plum rains have been continuous, and the Jiang tide has been surging, making the Qiantang Seawall extremely dangerous. It has been reported that many sections of the seawall in Xixing and Wenyan are broken and the situation is dangerous. The villagers along the seawall, considering that the matter concerns the lives and residences of the people, have reported the dangerous sections of the seawall to the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau for consideration of repairs to avoid danger.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Hong Yuchang Silk Store Also Ran Aground Yesterday. Hong Yuchang Silk Store on Dongmen Street in Ningbo City is owned by Hong Cangting. This time, because of the successive collapses of Geng Yu, Tong Kang, and Hong Tai, Hong Yuchang was indirectly affected as a shareholder. The various money shops that Hong Yuchang Silk Store dealt with cautiously stopped paying their debts. Yesterday, they also declared that they were running aground and stopped doing business. There are no major discrepancies in the amounts.</p>
<p>Two Robbery Cases in Yinxi and Yaobei. Hong, who runs a cool hat shop behind the Bailongwang Temple in Yinxi, is quite well-off. At midnight on May 26, six bandits speaking with a Taiwanese accent suddenly broke open the gate with wooden sticks. Hong was just settling accounts in Yong that day, leaving only women and children at home, who were robbed as the bandits overturned boxes and chests, stealing more than 60 silver dollars and a pair of gold bracelets before leaving with torches. Shui Gen from Yuyao runs a wine, rice, and sundries shop in Xiaocaoe Temple in the north of Yuyao. The shop has been open for many years and is quite prosperous, which has attracted the covetousness of bandits. At about 10:00 PM the other day, the shop had closed its doors and was preparing to go to bed when five bandits speaking with foreign accents suddenly came, asking to buy melon seeds as a pretext to open the door and loot wildly, resulting in the loss of silver, clothes, and other items.</p>

<p>Cemetery Arrangement: The May 30th Martyrs' Cemetery was built on May 25, 1928. A memorial tower was built in front of the tomb, towering into the clouds. The cemetery is surrounded by walls. In January of this year, the May 30th Incident Victims' Families Association negotiated with the British Public Works Department and resolved the compensation issue. After the families decided, in addition to repaying the 10,000 yuan previously advanced for the construction of the cemetery, they also allocated 10,000 yuan to add to the repairs of the cemetery, so the cemetery building became more tidy. At 7:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, the representatives of the Families Association, Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai, Secretary Zhou Zaisheng, and staff members Wang Dianyin and Sun Guangfu, arrived first to make careful arrangements. A horizontal banner was hung at the gate, reading "Public Memorial Ceremony for the May 30th Martyrs by the People of All Circles in Shanghai." The stone steps in front of the tomb were hastily built yesterday and completed. A couplet was hung on both sides of the tomb, reading "The blue blood is buried forever, leaving only a sad history of Shanghai, the monument stands tall, awakening the national spirit of China." A canopy was erected over the tomb, and the Premier's portrait was hung on the tombstone, with the Kuomintang flag and the national flag on both sides.

<h3>Postponement of the Disbandment of the Likin Tax Conference</h3>
<p>Third Preparatory Meeting Held Today</p>
<p>The Conference Date Will Be No Later Than Ten Days</p>
<p>The National Likin Tax Disbandment Conference was originally scheduled to hold its opening ceremony at 10:00 AM today in the auditorium of the Central Bank in Shanghai. However, as of yesterday, the representatives from the provincial finance bureaus and the special commissioners of the Ministry of Finance were unable to arrive in time, resulting in a very small number of attendees. It was estimated that less than half of the representatives would be present today. Therefore, the conference date has been postponed, and a third preparatory meeting will be held today. A public telegram will be sent in the name of the conference to the provincial finance bureaus and special commissioners of the Ministry of Finance, requesting that they immediately appoint the section chiefs or division chiefs in charge of the Likin tax in their respective provinces to come to Shanghai as soon as possible for consultation and reporting on the income situation of the Likin tax in each province. This will facilitate the collection of opinions from all representatives, the formulation of proposals, and their submission to the National Government for implementation. According to Mr. Li Jiming, a counselor dispatched by the Ministry of Finance to Shanghai to preside over the conference, the conference date has been postponed for several days, and the meeting will be held after more than half of the representatives from various provinces have arrived. Therefore, it will be no later than ten days. Representatives from remote provinces who are unable to send representatives due to travel difficulties will submit written reports.

<h3>Yangtze River Fares Drop Significantly Starting Today</h3>
<p>Months of Disputes Resolved</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Steamship Companies Form Alliance</p>
<p>Yangtze River boat tickets from six Chinese and foreign companies have always been uniformly managed and could not be privately lowered or raised. Since the dissolution of the Public Ticket Bureau, British and Japanese steamship companies have regained control of ticket sales to compete for passengers with Chinese-owned ships. This has led to inconsistencies in ticket prices, with each company setting its own rates. With the recent rise in the price of gold, steamship ticket prices have generally increased, with North and South China Sea routes already increasing by 10-20%. Initially, British merchants advocated raising Yangtze River ticket prices to maintain profits, with Jardine Matheson taking the lead. However, the Taikoo Dockyard argued that passenger traffic on the Yangtze River this year was not as good as in previous years and insisted on maintaining the original prices. The Japanese company Nisshin Steamship Company fundamentally opposed the British proposal, stating that the current situation was such that both cargo and passenger traffic on the Yangtze River had declined, and ticket prices should be lowered to attract passengers. Therefore, opinions diverged and no agreement could be reached. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company did not express its position. For months, the disputes remained unresolved. Finally, in late May, the four companies, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nisshin, and China Merchants, held several meetings to publicly discuss the long-delayed issue of rising and falling ticket prices. The majority decided that the main reason for the significant decrease in passengers in the Gan and Wan ports this year was local unrest, and the situation in Hankou was further complicated by the ongoing Ping-Han Railway war, making it difficult to raise prices immediately. Therefore, Jardine Matheson's proposal to raise prices could not be sustained. Starting today, Yangtze River ticket prices from Shanghai to Hankou will be reduced, with a 20% discount on the original price. However, round-trip tickets previously sold at a 30% discount will now be cancelled and must be purchased at full price. The agreement was signed by the four companies. The months-long dispute over Yangtze River ticket prices has now come to an end, and the competitive situation of mutually raising and lowering prices since the dissolution of the Public Ticket Bureau has also ended. Starting June 1st, Yangtze River ship tickets will return to the alliance status of three years ago. This is also a major issue in the Yangtze River shipping industry. The new ticket prices are listed below (the following are the first-class ticket prices for the main dining room):</p>

<h3>New Yangtze River Freight News</h3>
<p>Downstream Freight Rates Reduced The original freight rate for cotton yarn shipped from Shanghai to Yichang on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River was 3 taels, 9 mace, and 6 fen per piece. Later, when the river water receded and Chinese ships stopped operating, the price increased by 30% to 5 taels, 1 mace, and 5 fen per piece. Now, due to the high water level in the upper reaches and the resumption of operations by many Chinese ships, the number of departures from Shanghai to Yichang has increased daily. The six companies in this city have reduced prices due to the abundance of ships and the scarcity of goods. The result of yesterday's discussion was that the freight rate for cotton yarn from Shanghai to Yichang will be calculated at 2 taels and 5 mace plus 30%, and the actual price from today will be 3 taels, 2 mace, and 5 fen, a reduction of 1 tael and 9 mace per piece according to the fixed amount.</p>
<p>Increased Freight Rates for Sugar Recently, it has been the peak season for shipping white sugar to the Yangtze River. Yesterday, the six companies discussed increasing freight rates and changing to new regulations. The previous method of charging based on weight for each piece of 100 jin has been changed to charging per piece, divided into large pieces (140 jin to 165 jin) and small pieces (within 140 jin). The new regulations and price increases will take effect today, with an increase of approximately 20% over the original rate. The details are recorded as follows (Destination) (Large Piece Price) (Small Piece Price) (Original Price per 100 Jin) Fen Fen Fen</p>

<h3>Municipal Land Bureau Consolidates Tax Revenue</h3>
<p>Land Collected Through Auction, Exchange, or Donation</p>
<p>Transfer Tax Collected, No Need to Re-Establish Contract</p>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau handles the purchase, auction, exchange, donation, and acquisition of land by various agencies or organizations. As these are all considered transfers in nature, they are subject to the real estate transfer tax. However, the previous method required the establishment of a contract before the tax could be paid and the ownership could be transferred. The bureau considered that these land transfers were different from ordinary transactions and that requiring a contract would make it difficult to deal with those who delayed establishing contracts. To consolidate tax revenue, new regulations have been established. In the future, for the above-mentioned land transfers, the transfer tax and the additional municipal expenses will be collected based on the transfer evidence, and there will be no need to fill out a contract. The deadline for tax payment will be six months from the date of the transfer, as stipulated in the temporary regulations for collecting real estate transfer tax in this special municipality. Those who exceed the deadline will be penalized according to the regulations. Those who have transferred land before the bureau's announcement but have not yet paid taxes will have one month to pay, and those who exceed the deadline will be handled according to the regulations without further leniency. It is reported that these measures have been approved by the Municipal Land Bureau and filed with the Municipal Government for the record.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Businessmen's Readjustment Committee Requests Reiteration of the Order Protecting Human Rights</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Businessmen's Readjustment Committee yesterday sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters of the National Government regarding the Shanghai Chinese Industry Workers' Union's unauthorized arrest of people, requesting the reiteration of the order protecting human rights. It also sent a letter to the Municipal Civil Training Committee, warning the Workers' Union against falsely claiming secret orders from higher-level agencies to arrest representatives of the drugstore guild. The letters and telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Telegram to the Central Party Headquarters of the Nanjing National Government: We received a letter on the 19th of this month from the Shanghai Special City Pharmaceutical Industry Guild stating, "Previously, the National Government issued a clear order protecting human rights, stating that the freedom of the body of law-abiding merchants and residents should not be infringed upon by others without legal procedures. The Songhu Garrison Command also issued a proclamation prohibiting arbitrary arrests. Unexpectedly, the previous time our guild was forced by the Workers' Union to install unemployed workers, and the representative publicly elected by the guild, Feng Jinpu, and others went to Beijing to petition and returned to Shanghai. Representative Feng cried at the North Station and was accused of being a reactionary by the Workers' Union and arrested by the Public Security Bureau. Our guild has already submitted the above situation to your committee for forwarding to various higher-level agencies for clear explanation. Unexpectedly, at 12:00 noon on the 17th of this month, officials from the Workers' Union rushed into the Yihanchun Drugstore in Xiaodongmen and asked about the manager. When told that the manager was out on business, they arrested the deputy manager without asking any questions and arbitrarily interrogated him at the Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union. Although Mr. Song stated that the matter of installing workers had already been submitted to the Central Government for review by the Businessmen's Readjustment Committee and should be resolved, the Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union still disregarded the situation and forcibly detained Mr. Song for two hours before releasing him. Such arbitrary arrest of law-abiding citizens is a violation of regulations and laws. We request that your committee forward this matter to various higher-level agencies and severely punish the actions of the Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union and reiterate the proclamation protecting human rights to curb the violence and reassure the people." After reviewing the case, it was found that the Public Security Bureau arrested Feng Jinpu at the request of the Workers' Union. The guild had previously reported the matter to the committee, and we were preparing to submit a document requesting the Party and government agencies to investigate and stop it. However, because Feng Jinpu was immediately released on bail, we remained silent. The store sought to resolve the matter in the face of adversity, which is already a clear indication. However, the Workers' Union's illegal actions cannot be resolved through reason. Not many days later, another strange incident of unauthorized arrest occurred. This kind of action not only tramples on the store's rights and disregards human rights, but also treats national laws and regulations as worthless. If this continues for a long time, it will repeat the past events of Wuhan and cause great panic in society. Based on the aforementioned situation, it is reasonable to send a telegram to your government and your department to request a thorough investigation and punishment of the illegal actions of the Workers' Union to warn future offenders and reiterate the order protecting human rights so that everyone is aware of it and unruly elements restrain themselves. This will be in the public interest." (2) Letter from the Municipal Civil Training Committee to the Businessmen's Readjustment Committee: The Secretary's Office forwarded your committee's two official letters dated May 19th and May 20th, which have been received. After investigation, it was found that Representative Feng Jinpu returned to Shanghai after petitioning on behalf of the store and encountered members of the Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union at the North Railway Station. The two sides had an argument and twisted each other to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, where they were released the next day. There is no evidence to prove that they were privately arrested. Song Fuchen accompanied the employees of the Tonghanchun Drugstore to the Social Bureau to petition for mediation regarding the issue of wage demands. The Social Bureau stated that a written request was needed, so they went to the Workers' Union to discuss solutions. There was no evidence of detention or withholding. The guild's exaggerated words are inappropriate, and your committee did not take the time to investigate and hastily made a judgment based on the guild's one-sided statement. It is deeply regrettable. Furthermore, the guild has repeatedly defied orders and refused to negotiate. Such extra-legal actions, as stated in your letter, only serve to increase class antagonism. We hope that your committee will strictly correct them. Otherwise, if this continues for a long time, it will cause great panic in society. This letter is sent to you for your review.</p>
<p>(3) Letter from the Businessmen's Readjustment Committee to the Municipal Civil Training Committee:</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Joint Petition for Relief in the Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Capital Silk and Satin Dyeing Trade Association, the Labor Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Workers' Union, and the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Dyeing Workers' Union jointly submitted documents to the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Municipal Party Department of the Chamber of Commerce, stating (Labor Side): The petition is submitted because outsiders are taking advantage of the situation to seize and endanger the business, causing various factories to face collapse, and the livelihood of thousands of workers is at stake. We request strict correction to maintain industry regulations and ensure survival. It is true that at the end of the eighteenth year, the association, etc., considering the decline of factory operations and the difficulty of maintaining them, based on the true spirit of labor-management mutual assistance, did not hesitate to sacrifice money and energy to assist the capital side in organizing a dye price consolidation committee in order to save it from its precarious state. After several months of consolidation, considerable results were achieved. Not only were the seventeen factories that had closed down re-established, but also a large number of the hundreds of unemployed workers were placed in jobs. This spirit can be regarded as the pioneer of labor-management cooperation and the beginning of a new era of self-help in various industries. After this, the road ahead was smooth and unimpeded, and labor and management were both bright. However, there are red dye shops that imitate the red dyeing of raw silk, and foreign yuan dye shops that imitate the yuan color dyeing of Japan. In addition, there are silk and satin industry profit-seeking foreign dyeing workers whose purpose is to destroy. These shops see that our industry's dye price consolidation is about to be profitable, so they become covetous and flock to silk shops to arbitrarily cut prices and seize business. For these shops, it is just doing extra business and there is no harm, but for our industry, it is destroying the entire front line and the impact is significant. Now, various factories are facing a precarious situation due to this major blow. The association, etc., is deeply concerned about the situation. The capital side's losses are not to be mentioned for the time being, but what about the livelihood of thousands of workers? Although there are no explicit provisions in our country's commercial scope laws, the old industry regulations have inherent practices that should not be abolished (the Civil Code states that if there are no legal provisions, one can follow custom). Our industry has always had distinctions such as silk and satin, cyan, blue, foreign colors, mercerized printing, red dyeing, finishing, sizing shafts, etc. Recently, foreign yuan dye shops have sprung up, but the business operations are different, the boundaries are clear, and each abides by its scope without any involvement. However, now there are foreign yuan, red dye shops, and this shop that are overstepping their bounds, arbitrarily seizing and cutting dye prices, eliminating alcohol costs, and destroying our industry by any means. This is not a proper business practice. If we do not strictly stop and correct it, then our silk and satin dyeing industry will be fundamentally wiped out, and more than sixty factories will inevitably close down at the same time, and thousands of workers will feel the pain of unemployment. This phenomenon is not exaggerated by the association, etc. The facts are all there and cannot be concealed. Looking at the former second-hand clothing industry and the current pharmaceutical industry, the issue of workers' placement and unemployment has led to disputes. Learning from past events, we have deep-seated concerns. We have always admired your bureau's concern for society and its guarantee of industry and commerce. Therefore, we hereby submit a petition, requesting prompt rescue and strict correction. If there are unscrupulous competitors who intend to seize and destroy, we request that they be stopped and appropriately punished, so as to maintain the old industry regulations and protect industrial and commercial peace and security. Our industry's labor and management will both receive your grace. With utmost sincerity, we submit this petition. (Capital Side) The petition is submitted because outsiders are destroying the business. We request strict orders to stop it in order to ensure business and guarantee capital. The association, etc., is due to the lack of unity among fellow members in previous years, the abandonment of industry regulations, the arbitrary cutting of dye prices, and the different evaluations in the market, resulting in increasingly declining business operations and economic peril. Now, due to the basic erosion, closures are heard from time to time, and the number of unemployed workers is increasing day by day, which affects people's livelihood and is a social concern. The dyeing industry is one of the material cultures of silk and cotton weaving. The rise and fall of business is related to the prosperity and decline of industry and the scarcity of people's livelihood. The Labor Silk and Cotton Dyeing Workers' Union and the Silk and Satin Dyeing Workers' Union deeply understand this. Unwilling to sit idly by, they believe that labor-management cooperation is essential to resolve the crisis. As an essential remedy, they organized a labor-management joint dye price consolidation committee in December of last year to standardize the dye prices of various colors in order to maintain the original capital. All unemployed workers have also been placed in jobs, and substantial subsidies have been properly planned for those who have been unemployed for a long time in order to maintain their livelihoods and avoid repeating the mistakes of the pharmaceutical industry dispute. Unexpectedly, just as the consolidation was underway, a group of miscellaneous outsiders hired foreign workers and intended to disrupt the business by not paying alcohol costs and suppressing dye prices, resulting in the association's price rates being defeated and business being in a state of panic. This kind of overstepping boundaries to seize business, benefit oneself and harm others, aggressively invading business, and deliberately destroying is not only directly destroying the silk and satin dyeing industry, but also indirectly harming the livelihoods of genuine workers. If we do not strictly ban it, the situation will worsen, and the industry affected by the association will inevitably collapse, increasing the number of unemployed workers, disrupting social livelihood, and causing panic and anxiety. Therefore, we have made a list of appeals, earnestly requesting your review and approval, and strictly ordering a stop and taking measures to ban it in order to maintain business and guarantee capital. This will be a great service. We submit this petition with sincerity.</p>

<h3>New Procedures for the Bank of China to Collect Checks</h3>
<p>Notice to all financial institutions to comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bank of China has recently noted that the number of foreign bank checks entrusted by various money shops and Chinese banks is huge, and the number of pages is even greater. Checks are unreliable, and there are often cases of returned checks. Moreover, the returned checks of various banks are often delayed until 6 or 7 pm because the checking procedures are troublesome. The bank needs to spend time and effort to return the checks, and the round trip at night is dangerous. Now, a proper method has been proposed: Checks collected on the same day are not allowed to be used on the same day. In this way, the return of checks can be handled slowly to avoid danger. Therefore, a notice was issued to all financial institutions yesterday, saying: (Respected Sirs, the number of checks entrusted to our bank by various precious shops is very large, and there are bound to be returned checks. The return of checks by various banks is often notified at 6 or 7 o'clock, which is too late, and the procedures are often difficult. Moreover, there are many risks on the way. In the future, please do not use the funds from the checks entrusted to our bank by various precious shops on the same day. Please forgive us and comply. Thank you very much. Shanghai Bank of China, May 31, 1920)</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan's Telegram on Disaster Relief in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Qinglan, Standing Committee Member of the National Government Relief Committee, personally went to the disaster area in Shaanxi to distribute grain and funds. The disaster-stricken people of the Three Qin regions, at this critical moment when their lives depended on breathing, knew they had received a savior. Mr. Sun Weiyi, the representative of the province stationed in Shanghai, received a detailed telegram from Xi'an reporting that Mr. Zhu Qinglan of Beiping arrived in Xi'an at 6 pm. Representatives from the Provincial Relief Committee, Jishi Branch, Red Cross Society, Buddhist Association, and Chinese and Foreign Joint Relief Association greeted him in the suburbs. Those who came with Mr. Zhu included Shang Yunting, Li Zushen, Zhang Huanhai, Tao Fuqing, and Wang Bozhi. In addition, Zhang Xianqing, Jiang Yuntai, and Lu Shuchen, members of the Shanghai Jishi General Association's distribution committee, also arrived in the province at the same time and stayed at the Jiangsu Guild Hall Jishi Branch. After a dinner at 8 pm, various charitable organizations held a welcome meeting at the residence. Deng Changyao, chairman of the Provincial Relief Committee, delivered a welcome speech, and Lu Xiaoyu, president of the Jishi Branch, reported on the general situation of the disaster. Because Mr. Zhu was anxious to provide disaster relief, he immediately asked the groups to discuss relief methods. They all agreed that the disaster was serious during the lean season and that the lives and deaths of the victims were at stake. However, Mr. Zhu's relief grain had not yet arrived, and it was not enough to wait. Mr. Zhu also said that the counties in western Shaanxi were in urgent need of relief, but the cash he brought was limited. He requested the local charitable groups to raise more funds to help. The groups felt that Mr. Song was sincere and immediately undertook to provide more than 200 shi of relief grain, which, together with Mr. Zhu's 800 shi, totaled 1,000 shi, selling for 30,000 yuan in silver. It was decided to distribute the grain in Liquan and Fufeng counties first. The meeting did not end until 1 am the next morning. At 5 am, Mr. Zhu and Li Zushen, etc., took a car back east to transport grain, leaving only Shang Yunting and Zhang Huanhai to distribute urgent relief in Shaanxi. Their enthusiasm and determination are admirable. In addition, Zhang Xianqing, a member of the Shanghai Jishi Association, plans to distribute urgent relief and seeds in Wugong. The disaster relief committee has already set off from the province today.</p>
<h3>National Goods Representatives to Jiaxing Today</h3>

It was decided to elect Lu Xingzhuang, Mou Yueqiu, and Sun Fuji to go to Jiaxing to discuss the venue and situation. The three gentlemen are scheduled to take the morning express train today (Sunday). The Federation has sent a telegram expressing its welcome and will send someone to meet them at the station.</p>
<h3>French Army Supply Bids</h3>
<p>Mr. Mac Ergan, Commander of the French Army stationed in Shanghai, will hold a bid on June 10 at 9 am at the office at No. 5, Avenue Dubail for the supply of fresh meat and canned food to merchants. Merchants who intend to bid should contact Mr. Ruru (transliteration) at the military camp at No. 347 Avenue Joffre from today until June 9 to request a bidding sample for filling in. The time is from 8:30 am to 10 am every day.</p>
<p>There is still local news on the following page.</p>
<h2>Page 15</h2>
<p>Seventeen suspected criminals, male and female, were arrested in the Dongya, Dongan, and other three hotels and sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. They were instructed to reschedule the trial. The details of the case are recorded below. The Lingpu Bureau routinely issues salaries to employees and workers once a month, which is a large amount. The day before yesterday (30th) happened to be the day for issuing</p>
<h3>May Salaries</h3>
<p>At 8:15 am, the director extracted 20,744 yuan in cash and specially appointed the factory supervisor of the bureau, Englishman Hart, engineer Xiren Ouwenc and the deputy director of the dredging department, Chinese Sun Duoqing, to bring a servant and take all the salaries on the bureau's yellow Leifei steamboat to the Huangpu Wharf for distribution. When the boat arrived at the Huangpu Wharf in Pudong, it stopped at the left side of the bureau's sea scorpion dredging machine ship at about 8:20 am. The captain of the machine ship was ordered to lead the workers to the Leifei wheel in order to distribute the money according to the list. However, Deputy Director of Dredging Department Sun Duoqing, surveyors Chen Wangshan, Zhang Shaoying, etc. opened the leather bag and were about to call the names for distribution when suddenly No. 12 of the Huangpu Ferry Bureau outside Jiujiang Road</p>
<p>A green gasoline boat sped up. Earlier, at 6:40 am yesterday, two men in black gowns bought tickets from the ticket office of the Huangpu Ferry Company outside Jiujiang Road and hired a No. 12 green gasoline boat, claiming to drive to the Kecai Iron Factory Wharf in Pudong. The captain Shen Alin, sailors, drivers, etc. started the engine and headed east. At 6:55 am, the boat arrived at the Kecai Iron Factory Wharf next to Taixiang Machine and docked. The two passengers asked the captain to tie the gasoline boat and wait. After they finished speaking, they disembarked at the same time. After 20 minutes, seven or eight people dressed in short clothes</p>
<p>Resembling workers successively jumped on the boat. At 8:10 am, the two previously hired passengers also arrived and ordered the captain to drive the boat to the wharf west of the Huidong Rirong Iron Factory and dock for 10 minutes. Then, they drove east (downstream) again and turned back west, driving to the vicinity of Huangpu Wharf. At that time, the Junpu Bureau's Leifei steamboat also happened to arrive and leaned against the outer挡 of the sea scorpion dredging ship. Therefore, the seven or eight people in short clothes in the gasoline boat each took out</p>
<p>Pistols and box cannons forced the captain to drive the boat to the Leifei wheel. The captain knew that they were bandits because he was threatened by these people and had no choice but to stop at the left stern of the Leifei wheel. At the same time, the seven bandits swarmed and boarded the Leifei, while the two passengers in long clothes ordered the captain to drive the boat back to the Kecai Iron Factory Wharf and disembarked and fled.</p>
<p>The robbers on the Leifei wheel fired more than 30 shots with pistols and box cannons. At that time, Hart and Ouwenc were sitting on the bench in front of the captain's cabin, and the three Chinese officials were sitting in the captain's cabin. When they heard the gunshots, they all raised their heads to look. Unexpectedly,</p>
<p>The bullets flew like beads. Engineer Shen Duoqing of the China Project was shot in the neck and throat, and the bullet shot out. The captain's cabin was full of blood because the vital point was hit. He fell to the ground and died on the spot. The westerner Hart could not avoid it and was shot twice in the chest and heart. He was shot once in each of his left and right arms and once in each of his left and right shoulders. He was seriously injured with a total of seven shots and fell to the bow of the boat. The westerner Ouwenc was shot once in each of his left and right shoulders and once in the chest. He was also injured with a total of three shots. He was still able to walk勉强, so he escaped to the sea scorpion dredging ship and then fell down. At the same time, the captain of the sea scorpion ship, Jin Asi (38 years old, from Wusong), was shot in the left shoulder because he was taking wages from the Leifei wheel. Also, the second captain of Leifei, Wu Miaogen, was grazed by a bullet on his right back and only injured his skin. The captain, sailors, and two Chinese payers of the wheel had already fled to the front and rear cabins, so they were fortunate enough to escape. Seeing that the personnel on the wheel were injured, dead, or躲避, the bandits</p>
<p>After achieving their purpose, they forced a sailor to act as the captain to steer the helm, and threatened the driver with a pistol to drive the Leifei wheel to the Kecai Iron Factory Wharf in Pudong and dock. Then, the bandits put all the huge sum of 20,744 yuan that had not been distributed into a leather bag, carried the bag ashore, and swaggered away. After the bandits left, the captain of the Leifei steamboat was relieved and untied the cable to drive the wheel back to the outer 挡 of the Huangpu Wharf sea scorpion dredging ship. The westerner Aiwen, who was shot three times and escaped to the sea scorpion ship, saw that the Leifei wheel had been driven away by the bandits. Another Liguo steamboat of the Junpu Bureau happened to pass by and was called by the crew of the sea scorpion ship to stop.</p>
<p>Aiwen was carried to the Gongji Hospital on North Suzhou Road for treatment. The captain of Leifei, Ni Derui, saw that Aiwen had been carried away and that there were four dead and injured people on his own ship, so he drove the wheel back to the Customs Wharf and first sent someone to carry Hart, who was seriously injured, to the Gongji Hospital for treatment. Then, he hired a car to carry the lightly injured captain of the sea scorpion dredging ship, Jin Lao Si, and the two captains on his own ship, Wu Miaogen, to the Chinese Red Cross Hospital on Tianfeng Road for treatment. Wu Miaogen only had his right back grazed by the skin, so he was bandaged and discharged. In this battle, the glass window in front of the captain's cabin of Leifei was shot through one hole, the left window was shot through three holes, and the rear window was shot through three holes. The captain's cabin and the wheel surface in front of the captain's cabin were</p>
<p>Covered with fresh blood, which was frightening to see. Engineer Shen Dating was injured on the spot and died, lying in the captain's cabin of Leifei. The wound bled profusely. Afterwards, the captain of Leifei reported the body to the Water Patrol Police Station, and the head of the police station approved the dispatch of Chinese detective Huang Songsheng to transport the body to the Rescue Bureau's autopsy station for inspection. That afternoon, Liu Pingfan, the coroner appointed by the Local Court, led the examiners to the station to begin the examination. It was found that Shen's throat was shot through by a bullet from the back of his neck. It was a gunshot wound to a vital point and he died. The body was handed over to the family for burial after verification. Shen was 36 years old and from Anhui. The body was collected by the family after being exempted from examination at 2 pm yesterday. After the case occurred, Captain Xu of the Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team also sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation after hearing the news. Detective He of the Customs Water Patrol Police Station believed that the case was serious and that the murderers and bandits should be arrested and brought to justice as soon as possible, so he immediately dispatched Chinese detectives Ge Changsheng, Cheng Yongnian, Huang Zhenlin, Huang Songsheng, Sun Agui, Wang Haiquan, Zhu Yuncheng, etc. to purchase lines and arrest them separately. At 9:30 pm, it was reported that multiple bandits were hiding in room 519 of a certain hotel on Zhejiang Road.</p>
<p>The Chinese and Western detectives from the Laozha Police Station immediately went to the address and arrested Du Yuelin, Liu Azi, Chen Huichun, Shi Alai, Liu Jinji, and women Gu Xingren, Liu Li's, and Zhu Ma's, all eight from Ningbo. Then, they entered room 507 of the hotel and searched the dressing table drawer.</p>
<p>Two empty bullets were found because the room was also rented by the people. However, Du and others confessed to having more accomplices at the police station. Therefore, the detectives went to No. 1 and 22, Yuan'an Lane, Guangdong Road, and No. 582, Dongya Hotel, Nanjing Road, and arrested Zhao Miaonan, Chen Baishou, Tang Baobao, Chen Azhi, Chen Genbao, Wang Shanbo, Wu Changbao, Wu Genxing, and Wu Arong, all nine, who were separately detained. At 9 am yesterday,</p>
<p>Hart, who was shot, died in the Gongji Hospital. The hospital notified the police station to send a police officer to carry the body to the autopsy station to report to the British Consulate Judge to examine and identify the body for family collection.</p>
<h3>Ouyang Suffers Severe Injuries, Possibly Life-Threatening</h3>
<p>The seventeen men and women apprehended were escorted to the Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Xu Jiashi presided over the trial, with Chief Prosecutor Zhou also present to perform his duties. First, Chinese and foreign detectives from the water and land police stations reported on the course of events. Subsequently, Chen Alin testified that he found it difficult to distinguish the faces of the thieves. Additionally, Hong Atang, a laborer from a certain iron factory at the Jardine Matheson Wharf, testified that he saw six or seven people each carrying leather bags passing by the Jardine Matheson Wharf yesterday morning.</p>
<p>The defendant Wu Changbao was confirmed to be among them. According to Wu Changbao's testimony, he previously worked for the Customs. Recently, eight rifles and four pistols were lost from the Customs warehouse in Pudong. Four detectives from the Water Police Station, including Sun Agui, asked me to investigate, so I went to the Dongya Hotel and was also arrested, etc. The detective from the Water Police Station stated that Wu's statement was true. This time, based on a report from Jin, stating that the stolen goods were hidden in Wu's house, he was arrested and his house in Pudong was searched, but nothing was found, etc. After questioning the remaining defendants, Judge Xu ruled that Gu Xingren and Liu Chenshi were released on bail with a deposit of 300 yuan each, while the others remained in custody pending a rescheduled hearing next Thursday (the fifth of this month).</p>
<p>The Zhifu Lane Housing Dispute Remains Unresolved</p>
<p>Hibino Opposes Eviction</p>
<p>Greater China Refutes Legally</p>
<p>Since the day Greater China Co., Ltd. purchased the Zhifu Lane property, it has notified each tenant by letter to vacate and return the houses by the end of May for its own use. While this case is being mediated by the Chamber of Commerce by sending letters to each tenant, the Japanese firm Hibino Yoko specially hired attorney Eto Sumi a few days ago to represent the firm in writing to Greater China regarding this lease termination issue, raising objections. Subsequently, Greater China, considering the Japanese firm's letter to be erroneous in its claims, immediately sent a reply to the Japanese representative, severely refuting it. Now, the original letters between the parties involved have been found and are appended below.</p>
<p>Hibino's Letter: Sirs, We are instructed by Hibino Yoko to reply to your esteemed letter of April 30, 19th year of the Republic. Regarding the properties located at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Fujian Road, leased by our clients, the original owner, Dalun Real Estate Co., concluded fixed-term lease contracts with each tenant for a period of twenty years. This contract has been adjudicated by the Shanghai Provisional Court, which confirmed its validity. Therefore, each of our clients, as tenants, still has the right to lease the properties for more than ten years. If it is true that your company has received the land and houses from Dalun Company, your company (as the successor to the rights) can only obtain the rights owned by the former owner (Dalun Company). The successor cannot obtain rights that the former owner did not possess. This is a fundamental principle of law. Therefore, your company's ownership is naturally subject to the restrictions faced by Dalun Company. However, according to the spirit of Article 425 of the Chinese Civil Code (even if the lessor transfers ownership of the leased object to a third party after its delivery, the lease contract continues to exist for the transferee (it is clear that there is such a custom)). Therefore, our clients cannot comply with your company's improper request. Addressed to Greater China Co., Ltd. Respectfully, Attorney Eto Sumi, May 24, 19th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Greater China's Reply: Sirs, We have received and read your letter of the 24th of this month, sent by your esteemed lawyer on behalf of Hibino Yoko. We have already announced that our company has received the property ownership from Dalun Company. The claims made by your advocate on behalf of your client, Hibino Yoko, this time do not conform to the facts or the law. We respectfully state the following points separately: (1) The tenants of the properties located at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Fujian Road, such as Lao Da Fang, have not entered into a fixed-term lease contract for twenty years with Dalun Real Estate Co. This has been clarified and confirmed by the court. The tenants of Lao Da Fang only asserted that there was an oral agreement and provided no evidence. Therefore, the court's judgment on the case included the reasoning that "Regarding the lease of the disputed houses by the appellant (referring to Dalun Company), if there were agreed terms, as with the former tenant of Mao Fu Hao (i.e., the Nanyang Socks Factory) and the appellant Hua Ying Pharmacy (fixed term of six years, already expired), written contracts were signed. If other tenants had also agreed to a term of twenty years, why would there be no written record? Furthermore, why would the appellants (referring to Lao Da Fang, etc.) willingly increase the rent beyond the original amount of more than 60,000 taels per year, willingly adding 40,000 taels to cancel the exchange condition of reclaiming the houses? The claim of an oral agreement for a term of twenty years is not credible." This was used to refute the reasons of Lao Da Fang, etc. This judgment has long been published by the court, and all newspapers have carried it. Furthermore, referring to Article 422 of the Chinese Civil Code (a lease contract for real estate with a term of more than one year should be made in writing; if not made in writing, it is regarded as a lease without a fixed term), this further proves that the so-called oral agreement for a term of twenty years absolutely cannot exist. We believe that your esteemed advocate, once attentive to reviewing, will be able to fully understand this. (2) Article 450 of the Chinese Civil Code stipulates that "If a lease has a fixed term, the lease relationship terminates when the term expires. If there is no fixed term, each party may terminate the contract at any time." The lease relationship between your client and each tenant with the former owner, Dalun Company, is not a fixed-term lease contract, but a lease contract without a fixed term, as previously stated. According to the aforementioned law, the provision for termination of the contract at any time should be absolutely applied. Your esteemed advocate is well-versed in the law and should be able to convey to your client to act in accordance with the law, so as not to regard a lease without a fixed term as a perpetual lease. (3) All leases without a fixed term are clearly stated in the house ticket: such as, if one party wishes to terminate the contract, both parties must give notice of termination within a period of one month. This is not only a common practice in Shanghai and other places, but it can also be considered a special agreement mutually recognized by both parties. The terms recorded on the house ticket are the expression of intent by the owner (i.e., the lessor), and all house tickets are delivered to the tenant (i.e., the lessee) for safekeeping. There is no doubt that the tenant tacitly approves of the terms recorded on the house ticket. According to contract principles, any evidence of mutual agreement between the parties, whether express or implied, can be considered as a valid contract (refer</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>ence (2) The tenant is in arrears with rent for three months. (3) The house is damaged and requires reconstruction before it can be vacated, etc. Regardless of whether the claim is appropriate, the court also relies on this as the basis for its judgment. Whether, according to the claim put forward by the tenant, the company's intention to reclaim the house for its own use should be considered in accordance with this custom is undoubtedly. Based on the above, we request your esteemed advocate to convey to your client that you still hope to comply with our company's previous notice to vacate within the time limit, in order to comply with the spirit of a country ruled by law where people abide by the law. Sincerely, To Japanese Attorney Eto Sumi, the 28th day of the fifth month, 19th year of the Republic.</p>

<h3>Humorous Account of a Wife Concealment Case</h3>
<p>A Wealthy Family's Maid Becomes a Villager's Wife</p>
<p>Twice Married, Suddenly Disappears</p>
<p>The First Precinct of the Second District of the city yesterday received a case reported by Ding Fusheng from Suzhou, along with his fellow villagers Wu Aqian and Pu Genfu, accusing someone of concealing his wife. The content is quite humorous. There is a Zhang mansion in Suzhou city.</p>
<p>There are many maids, and they are sent away to marry when they reach adulthood, but a small amount of betrothal money is collected. Among them, there is a maid named A'da, who is eighteen years old this year, and was bought in since childhood. Her surname is still unknown.</p>
<p>She is quite beautiful. Pu, a villager from Hu Shu Pass, Pu Genfu's mother, often works as a helper in the city. She knew that the Zhang mansion wanted to send the maid away to marry.</p>
<p>Being eager for a grandson and lacking large sums to complete the marriage for Genfu, she considered this cheap option and bought A'da for 130 yuan the year before last, completing the marriage for her son and forming a family. After marriage, the maid, who grew up in</p>
<p>a wealthy family, although her status was low, did not have to endure the hardships of rural life, and thought highly of herself, disdaining</p>
<p>to associate with rural laborers, and was often dissatisfied with her family, leading to discord. Moreover, Pu Genfu liked to gamble and gambled heavily during the Lunar New Year last year, incurring substantial losses and debt, which he could not repay, resulting in the</p>
<p>intention to sell his wife. About three miles from Pu's house, there is a farmer named Ding Fusheng, 30 years old, living with his mother. His family has several acres of farmland, sufficient for self-sufficiency in the village, and no extra money to marry a wife, so although he is of marriageable age,</p>
<p>his marriage is still vacant. His mother heard that Pu Genfu intended to sell his wife, which was a perfect match for her son, so they agreed on a betrothal gift of 220 yuan, mortgaged the farmland, and obtained the money to go to A'da's house on the twelfth day of the first month</p>
<p>to become his new bride. However, Ding's family is of the same type as Pu's, and the hardship of her labor is still the same. Moreover, Ding's appearance is not as good as Pu's, so A'da became even more dissatisfied. However, Ding treated A'da</p>
<p>as a celestial being and flattered her in every way, so she reluctantly lived with him for one year and three months. On May 19th of this year, she secretly fled without a trace. After losing his wife, Ding Fusheng was greatly alarmed, fearing</p>
<p>both loss of money and person, so he searched everywhere but found nothing. Later, a letter was sent from Wu Aqian, a fellow villager living at No. 11 Dajilu, Huangjiaque Road, Ximen, Shanghai, stating that A'da had been there on the 20th. At that time, Ding was not at home. When he returned home and saw the letter, he rushed to Wu's house, but A'da</p>
<p>had suddenly disappeared again. When asked, Wu Aqian said that A'da stayed for three days and then left, saying that she was going to Pu Genfu's place. Ding inquired about Pu's address, and was told that it was at the</p>
<p>Red Rail Bridge Shanghai Candy Company. He went to find Pu and was denied meeting A'da. Ding, in desperation, argued that Wu Aqian and A'da did not know each other, so how could she stay at his house, clearly colluding with Pu to hide her, so he called the police and arrested them. The First Precinct of the Second District immediately transferred them to the District Court for verification.</p>
<h3>Forcibly Kissing</h3>
<p>A Tailor's Vexatious Behavior</p>
<p>Wang Guiren's Daughter Assaulted</p>
<p>Wang Guiren, a native of Changzhou residing at No. 6 Dexing Lane, Xinmin Road, Zhabei, works as a chef and has a daughter named Lindi, who is of marriageable age and quite beautiful. She currently works in a nearby silk factory. Shao Xing tailors Ji Awu, Ji Ali, and Sheng Tai, who live on the same road in Fengxiang Lane, arbitrarily tease and ridicule Lindi every evening when she passes by the alley entrance after work. Lindi is taciturn and ignores them. Awu and others think Lindi can be bullied. The previous night, at around 8:00 PM, Lindi went out to buy things and passed by the same place again. Awu and others went forward and grabbed Lindi's hand, intending to kiss her. Lindi became enraged and cursed loudly, and Awu and others also cursed back. As they argued, Lindi went home and tearfully told her father what had happened. Wang then went to reason with them, but Awu and others were not there. Unexpectedly, at 7:30 AM yesterday morning, Awu and others gathered many hooligans and went to Lindi's house, dragging her father, Wang Guiren, into the alley and brutally beating him, causing Wang's head to be broken and bleeding profusely, causing serious injuries. Seeing that they had caused a major disaster, Awu and others took the opportunity to escape. The patrol police arrived and took the landlady of the tailor shop to the First Precinct of the Fourth District to hand over Awu and others for investigation.</p>
<p>Grand-Aunt and Grand-Nephew</p>
<p>An Incestuous Elopement Case</p>
<p>Chen Wangshi, the wife of Chen Rurong, a laborer from Funing, living at No. 48 Zhangjiabang Road, Pudong, is 31 years old this year. However, this woman is naturally licentious. Chen Rurong has a direct cousin, Chen Deli, 33 years old, living at No. 33 on the same street, who often goes to his grand-uncle's house. Chen Wangshi, regardless of seniority, immediately developed affection for her grand-nephew upon seeing his strength, so they exchanged amorous glances, and Chen Deli was, of course, perceptive. Thus, they engaged in an animalistic act that greatly altered human ethics. Moreover, since they could not do as they pleased, they eloped to Dalianwan Road on May 1st to the house of Deli's brother, Demu. The grand-aunt and grand-nephew actually became husband and wife. After his wife fled, Chen Rurong began to inquire and learned that his wife was at Demu's place, so he filed a complaint with the Third Precinct of the Third District yesterday. The police dispatched officers to arrest Chen Deli and Chen Wangshi together. The case involves incest and was immediately transferred to the District Court for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Prohibition of Cargo Vehicles Passing Through Hengfeng Bridge</h3>
<p>Traffic Diverted to Wuzhen Bridge</p>
<p>After the southern section of the Hengfeng Bridge in Zhabei collapsed in 1927, a temporary wooden bridge was rebuilt by the Municipal Works Bureau, with the contractor guaranteeing its stability for three years. Now that the guarantee period is about to expire, the bureau has sent personnel to inspect the bridge and found that the two rows of piles in the northern section, the part that did not collapse at the time, are severely corroded. Repairs are currently being planned. Before the repairs are completed, it is stipulated that small cars, rickshaws, passenger cars, and empty cargo trucks can still pass as usual.

<h3>Dispute over French Concession Police Expelling Street Vendors</h3>
<p>Xujiahui Town in Shanghai West is located at the intersection of the Chinese and French territories. Due to its strategic location, the French Concession has established a police booth at the Zhaojiabang Bridge to station Chinese and Vietnamese police officers to prevent any emergencies. Xujiahui Town is the leading town in Shanghai West, with a gathering of merchants and civilians. However, there is no proper vegetable market, so before 9:00 AM, villagers carry vegetable baskets on their shoulders and set up stalls on both sides of the road to sell their goods. However, the French Concession No. 145 Chinese police officer Yang Rongsheng (20 years old, from Yancheng, newly appointed as a patrol officer) drove away all the small vegetable stalls around the turn of the Bédan Road on the 29th (yesterday morning) and kicked over the vegetable baskets at will, leaving the poor vendors in dire straits. The vendors moved to the Chinese territory in droves, causing temporary disorder. Zhao Xiwun, the second patrol officer of the Sixth Precinct of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, Sixth District, witnessed the situation and quickly stopped him. The Chinese police officer reported to the Shanzhong Road police station, which sent three officers to inquire. The acting patrol officer, Xue Jinxian, informed the three officers that the police officer had expelled the vegetable vendors. The three officers publicly reprimanded the Chinese police officer, and then they dispersed. Unexpectedly, after being reprimanded, the police officer became angry and, together with Chinese police officer No. 623, sought trouble with police officer Xie Yongzhang of the Third Patrol. Without asking why, they seized Xie's police equipment and forcibly dragged him to the French Concession. Fortunately, Xie was quick-witted and immediately sounded the whistle for help. At that time, the onlookers were indignant and helped the police officer to arrest the two Chinese police officers and bring them back to the station. Soon, Gu Laike (transliteration), the deputy police chief of Shanzhong Road, arrived to request bail. Director Xu of the Xujiahui Police Station reported the matter by telephone to Director Yuan, as the case was of great importance. Director Yuan instructed the two Chinese police officers who had caused the trouble to be handed over to the police chief to be severely punished to maintain friendship, etc. Director Xu told him the details of the incident and allowed him to take them back first, while preparing a document to report to Director Yuan and request serious negotiations with the French Consul to safeguard sovereignty and avoid disputes.</p>
<h3>Mother Grieves Over Daughter's Abduction and Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>An elderly woman from Jiangbei, Xiao Li, 55 years old, lives in a grass shed near Xiangyanqiao, Zhabei. She has a daughter named Jinlian, who is ten years old and quite beautiful. Her neighbor, Miao Xiaoyuan, from Yancheng, works as a dockworker and, seeing Jinlian's beauty, seduced her and committed adultery. A month ago, they both eloped. Xu Zhiren, who lives with her, said to Xiao Li yesterday, "Your daughter was abducted by Miao, I know it very well. If you go abroad and seek blessings, you can recover her." Xiao Li loved her daughter very much. Now that Xu knew where she was, she might as well go and look for her together. If she could get her daughter back, she would respect him with five Buddha statues. Xu then firmly said that it was impossible and angrily walked away. Xiao Li still wanted to hold his hand, but Xu was strong and Xiao fell to the ground. After a while, the woman, feeling that life was meaningless, committed suicide at 3:00 PM by cutting her throat with a vegetable knife, exposing her trachea. Later, her neighbor took her to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but because the cut was very deep, it was feared that she could not be saved. However, the incident was caused by a slip of the tongue by Xu Zhiren, and he has now been detained by the Third Precinct of the Fifth District.</p>

<h3>Patrol Police Arrest Gun-Carrying Criminal Mid-Patrol</h3>
<p>Sighting Four Suspicious Men</p>
<p>Chasing and Capturing Qiang Haosheng</p>
<p>Patrol police Zhu Lianqing, Xu Fuzhou, Jin Jiushan, and Li Furen of the First Precinct of the Nanshi District were patrolling at around 8:00 AM yesterday when they saw four men get off the No. 1 streetcar of the Huashang Tram Company, traveling from Xiaodongmen to Dongsheng Road. After alighting, they walked south, behaving very suspiciously. Since they were already far away, the police officers jumped on the streetcar and chased after them. When they reached the Merchants' Guild Wharf, they saw only three people. One person was missing. Seeing the urgency, Policeman Zhu immediately got out of the car and grabbed a man. After a brief search, nothing was found, and he was released. The man then ran away in a hurry, making him even more suspicious. Policeman Zhu immediately ordered Policeman Xu and others to catch up and arrest him. He then approached the two men and grabbed them with both hands, ordering them to stop. As he was about to conduct a search, one of them pulled out a pistol from his pocket and aimed it at Policeman Zhu's temple, intending to fire. For some reason, the bullet did not come out. Policeman Zhu glanced back and saw the pistol. Having no choice, he released the man he was holding and pulled out his own pistol, intending to resist. Since there were many onlookers on the road, the man fled into the crowd and disappeared without a trace. Policeman Zhu was afraid that the other man he was holding would also escape, so he did not chase after him and brought the man back to the station. One of the men chased by Policeman Xu and others ran straight to Luxi Street. In a panic, the man pulled out a pistol from his pants and fired four shots backwards. Fortunately, they did not hit anyone. When the bullets ran out, he threw the pistol aside and fled into a small alley. The police officers picked up the pistol he had dropped and took it back to the station. After reporting the matter to the station chief, he brought the man Zhu arrested for preliminary interrogation. According to his confession, his name is Qiang Haosheng, 23 years old, from Wuxi, and he works as a clerk in Qiang Dechang Western Iron Shop at No. 55 Noxin Road, Datong Road. Today, a friend Wu Achun (referring to one of those who escaped) invited me to work together at the wharf. I didn't know he had a pistol in his bag, etc. He was ordered to be temporarily detained for investigation and further verification.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Death of Li Lian</h3>
<p>Assassination or Robbery?</p>
<p>Li's Wife Weeps Bitterly</p>
<p>Hong Benli, the former magistrate of Fengxian County, came to Shanghai after resigning and lived at No. 1107 and a half, Chuanfuli, Xinzha Road, for half a month. His secretary, Li Lian, also lived in Hong's residence in the rear room on the upper floor. On the morning of the 29th of last month, four bandits suddenly broke into Hong's house. One bandit with a pistol went upstairs. Li shouted wildly when he saw them, and the bandit fired two shots, hitting Li's vital organs, and he fell to the ground and died. The four bandits then fled together. After the case occurred, some suspected it was an assassination, and others suspected it was a robbery because Li's shouting led to him being shot. The police station in charge sent detectives to investigate and transported the body to the Fellen Road autopsy center. The next morning, Prosecutor Guo, commissioned by the Special District Court, arrived at the center to conduct an autopsy. The wife of the deceased cried until her tears ran dry, pleading for the arrest of the murderer to bring justice. Hong also appeared in the case and stated that he was willing to take charge of the burial because the family of the deceased was poor and unable to purchase clothes and a coffin. Prosecutor Guo then ordered the corpse to be handed over to Hong Benli for burial.</p>
<h3>Wang Ajin Shot to Death by Bandits</h3>
<p>At around 10:00 AM, Wang Ajin, residing at No. 68 Xiaoshadu Road, went out with his friend Wu Lirong. Just as they reached the entrance, Wang stopped to urinate. Suddenly, four bandits appeared, pulled out pistols, and shot at Wang. Wu quickly turned around and ran into the house unscathed. Wang was hit by a bullet and fell into a pool of blood. When the Putuo Road police station in charge received the report, they sent detectives to the scene, but the two murderers were nowhere to be seen. Wang had already died, and his body was transported to the Fellen Road autopsy center. Yesterday, Prosecutor Guo, commissioned by the Special District Court, arrived at the center to conduct an autopsy and ordered the corpse to be taken for burial by the wife of the deceased, Wang Ding.</p>

<h3>70,000 Red Pills Found in a Rickshaw</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around three o'clock, a rickshaw with the license number 5701 from the concession, passing the entrance of Lanting Lane on Hengfeng Road in Zhabei, was being pulled northward by a rickshaw puller. Wan Qi, from the fourth guardhouse of the second precinct of the fourth district, noticed that although the rickshaw was empty, the rickshaw puller looked flustered, as if carrying heavy items. He immediately went forward to search, initially finding nothing. However, upon removing the cushion, he was greatly shocked to discover a large quantity of red pills, totaling seventy boxes with 70,000 pills. The rickshaw puller and the red pills were taken to the precinct. After questioning by Director Li, the rickshaw puller confessed that he was Wu Hongtu, a 21-year-old from Yancheng, residing at Yaojia Stone Bridge on Xinmin Road. He said that earlier, he had been pulling his rickshaw to Taiping Bridge on Caishi Street in the French Concession when two well-dressed individuals asked him to transport the items to the Maigen Road station. They placed the items inside the cushion, with one person sitting on the rickshaw and the other following behind. When they reached Hengfeng Bridge, the person in the rickshaw suddenly got off, instructing him to pull the rickshaw ahead, and he claimed to have no knowledge that the contents were contraband. Director Li, noting that the rickshaw puller's clothing was neat and that his story was suspicious, suspected him of being involved in trafficking, despite his evasive statements, and ordered him to be sent to the bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Liang Lianzhi Sues Her Husband for Cohabitation</h3>
<p>And Demands Alimony Supplement</p>
<p>A woman named Liang Lianzhi, originally from Zhongshan, Guangdong, is 26 years old. On February 24th, 1925, she married Xie Zhaogui, from the same hometown, through a matchmaker. At that time, Xie was working at Butterfield &amp; Swire (太古洋行), earning a substantial monthly income. On December 18th of the same year, Liang gave birth to a daughter. Xie, having had an affair, did not have a strong relationship with his wife. Even when he occasionally returned home, he only inquired about his elderly father, ignoring Liang. In April 1928, after the death of Xie's father, Xie, no longer restrained, leased out the house and moved all the furniture to 905 Weihai Lane (衛海里), Weihaiwei Road, permanently cohabitating with his mistress and abandoning Liang. Liang was left with no choice but to take her daughter and live at her sister's house at 13 Fudeli (輔德里), Baochang Road, Zhabei. One day, Xie suddenly invited Liang to the accounting firm of Wang Zikang (王梓康) (which also had a lawyer's sign), attempting to force her to sign a divorce agreement. Liang saw through the plan, and Xie's scheme failed. Later, mutual friends, feeling sorry for Liang's loneliness, mediated, and Xie reluctantly agreed to pay her 50 yuan in alimony each month. The payment was handled by Wu Fozhong (吳茀仲), a Cantonese working at Jardine Matheson (怡和洋行). However, after only three months, the payments stopped. From December 1928 to May of this year, Liang has been living on borrowed money, accumulating significant debt. Her plight as an abandoned wife is truly pitiful. She has been forced to seek legal assistance, retaining lawyer Zhang Deqin (張德欽) to file a lawsuit in the Special District Court against Xie Zhao, demanding cohabitation and requesting 950 yuan to cover 19 months of unpaid alimony. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou Daren (周逹仁) opened the court, summoning the plaintiff, Xie Liang Lianzhi, who arrived with her five-year-old daughter and lawyer Zhang, to recount her abandonment. Her face was filled with sorrow, and tears almost welled up in her eyes. However, her daughter was jumping around in front of her mother, displaying a state of innocent happiness. If Xie could see this, perhaps it would stir feelings for his child. Unfortunately, Xie, fearful of appearing in court, did not come in person and appointed lawyer Ni Jiong (倪炯) to represent him. After questioning, Judge Zhou determined that further witness testimony was needed and adjourned the hearing to 10:00 AM on June 2nd.</p>
<h3>Fish Market Dispute Case Verdict</h3>
<p>Zhang and Shui Fined and Released</p>
<p>Chen and Wang Imprisoned for One Month, Permitted to Pay to Redeem</p>
<p>Zhang Zhisheng (張志勝) and Shui Jiakuan (水嘉寛), managers of the Fukang Fish Market (福康魚行) outside the Xiaodongmen Bund in the French Concession, had, last month, unsuccessfully attempted to encroach on the stall space of the neighboring Qianfeng Fish Market (乾豐魚行). They gathered dozens of associates from Fukang, Yuantong (源通), and Taichang (泰昌) fish markets, including Chen Aqing (陳阿青) and Wang Ashuang (王阿雙), and led them to the Qianfeng Market, where they beat and injured eight associates, including Wang Mingyuan (王明元), Yan Zuying (嚴祖英), and Liu Zhusheng (劉竹生). Subsequently, Wang Mingyuan and others from Qianfeng Fish Market retained lawyer Bao He (包和) to file a lawsuit in the French Concession Court, accusing the defendants Zhang Zhisheng and Shui Jiakuan of acting barbarously and violating criminal law, requesting strict punishment according to the law, and seeking compensation of 299 yuan for medical expenses and over 400 yuan for all losses. The defendants also retained a lawyer to defend them. After hearing the case, the court adjourned to await the verdict. Yesterday, the verdict was announced. The prosecutor's office summoned both parties, and Judge Zhu (朱承審官) ruled that the case was based on a dispute between parties in the same trade. The defendants Zhang Zhisheng and Shui Jiakuan should not have gathered a crowd to assault the plaintiffs and damage their goods, which violated criminal law. Zhang and Shui were each fined 25 yuan, and Chen Aqing and Wang Ashuang were each sentenced to one month of imprisonment, with the option to pay to redeem their sentences, to serve as a warning. The defendants were ordered not to harass the plaintiffs again. The medical expenses were to be borne two-thirds by the defendants Zhang, and they were to bear one-fifth of the losses. This is the verdict.</p>

<p>Yin Maozhao (陰懋昭), a student from Luxian (瀘縣), Sichuan Province, in the Chinese painting department of the Shanghai Art School, rented a room on the upper floor of the Yixingtai (義興泰) tobacco and paper shop at 441 Caishi Road in the French Concession for only two months. He suddenly died of illness around 5:00 AM on the morning of the 29th of last month. His roommate and fellow townsman, Jiang, immediately discovered it and reported to other students at the Art School, requesting the school authorities to assist with the funeral arrangements. Consequently, the school's director of general affairs, Ding Yuanli (丁遠立), issued a notice to collect funeral expenses from all faculty and students. At the same time, he immediately notified the French police station to investigate and verify the cause of death. The school then handed over all the donated funds to several representatives from the student's hometown, who immediately rushed to make arrangements for the coffin to be placed at 4:30 PM that afternoon.</p>

<h3>This Newspaper's May 31st, Tokyo Telegram</h3>
<p>After the soccer competition ended in a tie, our country's representatives held an emergency meeting regarding Japan's attitude on the 30th. Afterwards, they officially negotiated with senior Japanese officials, requesting a continuation of the match to determine who should win the championship. However, the Japanese insisted that after the game on the 29th, the coaches immediately held a meeting and unanimously agreed that there was no need for another game to determine the winner. Therefore, the negotiation was unsuccessful. However, afterwards, according to our country's soccer coach, he had stated to the Japanese side that this matter was important and needed to be approved by our country's delegation's executive committee. However, the Japanese misunderstood and, after a heated debate, Japan still insisted on the same agreement and refused to concede, ultimately leading to the decision that the soccer championship would be reserved for the next competition. Both China and Japan would each receive first-place medals for this competition. According to this complex content, the reporter also heard that our country's committee initially proposed a rematch, with the condition that another fair and capable referee be used. However, the Japanese said that the referee that day was already the most competent in Japan. Therefore, the negotiation had no results. In fact, to put it bluntly, even if the referee could be replaced and the game replayed, our country might not necessarily be able to win. Because the new referee could still declare our players offside when they had an attack or a good opportunity. If our players had any rash actions, their qualifications could be revoked. In short, they would do anything and everything to ruin our chances of winning.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Enraged</h3>
<p>This Newspaper's May 31st, Tokyo Telegram: After the soccer match on the 29th, hundreds of our country's students who were cheerleaders were angry at the referee's unfairness and remained in the stands, refusing to leave. Three representatives were pushed forward to see the coaches and officials, demanding withdrawal from the games, strongly protesting the Japanese referee's bias. Finally, Hao Boyang (郝伯陽) came forward to comfort them, asking the cheerleaders to restrain themselves slightly and maintain national dignity. There were still several students who were filled with anger, scolding the delegation's weakness, uselessness, and loss of national dignity. After some time, the cheerleaders saw that continued resistance was useless and left with anger.</p>
<h3>Zhang Boling Negotiates Again</h3>
<p>Associated Press, May 31st, Tokyo: Regarding the soccer championship dispute at the Far Eastern Games, the Chinese and Japanese representatives discussed the results on the 29th and decided to reserve the decision, which would be formally decided by the Games' general affairs committee on the 30th. However, at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, China suddenly requested a rematch in the name of Zhang Boling. Therefore, the representatives from both sides negotiated again, and the results were announced as follows. The general affairs committee's decision was resolved.</p>
<p>The general affairs committee of the Ninth Far Eastern Games recognizes that the China-Japan soccer match on the 29th was a tie. Because the Games' dates have expired, there will be no rematch. The championship trophy will be reserved until the next games, and the soccer silver cup will be kept by the Philippines, the organizer of the next games. Both China and Japan will be ranked first.</p>

<p>Honorary President, Kishi Seiichi; First President, Wang Zhengting; Second President, Fan Jiasi</p>
<p>The regulatory commission has not yet resolved amateur sports rules</p>
<p>The above resolutions are more detrimental than beneficial to China and should be heeded</p>
<p>This Newspaper, May 29th, Tokyo: The General Affairs Committee of the Far Eastern Games held a meeting on the morning of May 29th. Important committees from China, Japan, the Philippines, and India attended to discuss the draft rules submitted by the Regulatory Commission. Subsequently, the following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>(1) Starting from the next games, the athletics competition will be divided into three championships: track events, field events, and all-around competitions. World rules will be applied.

<p>(4) If the result of the soccer match is a tie, the game time should be extended.</p>
<h3>Games Flag</h3>

<p>(5) All ball game officials, especially referees, should be invited to be neutral parties who have no relationship with the ball game to avoid unpleasant disputes.</p>
<p>(6) Tennis will now be called lawn tennis Lawn Tawn Tennis. For competitions with eight or fewer players, Davis Cup rules will be applied. The championship country from the previous games will also join the draw to eliminate priority rights. The distribution of eight players is as follows: four singles players and four doubles players.</p>
<p>(7) Those who join baseball should be under 20 years old. American Major League rules will be applied. The referee officials used in each game should be agreed upon by both sides.</p>
<p>(8) The Indian representative proposed listing hockey as a competition item. The General Assembly decided to use this as a demonstration competition.</p>
<p>(9) The Philippine representative proposed that the tenth games be held in the third week of May 1934. The Chinese representative stated that they wish to hold them in August. This proposal will be considered later.</p>
<p>(10) The following officials were elected for the next games: Honorary President, Dr. Kishi Seiichi; President, Philippine Senate Speaker Quezon; First Vice President, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting; Second Vice President, Philippine Fan Jiasi; Honorary Secretary, Philippine Yilanan.</p>
<h3>Regulatory Commission</h3>
<p>This Newspaper, May 31st, Tokyo: The Regulatory Commission discussed amateur sports rules and decided that sports instructors and gymnastics teachers should not be considered amateur athletes. The Philippine representative strongly opposed this. This matter will be discussed further by the subcommittee. The general public now believes that to improve the noble spirit of athletes, gymnastics teachers may not be considered amateur athletes by the public.</p>
<h3>Yesterday a disturbance occurred in the Philippine-Japan boxing match</h3>
<p>Referee Unfair, Philippines Withdraws from Final</p>
<p>Order in chaos, spectators want ticket refunds</p>
<p>This Newspaper, May 31st, Tokyo: Today's Japanese-Philippine open boxing final was well attended. After the lightweight competition, the Philippine athletes were unwilling to participate in the light and featherweight finals because of the unfair referee and other rematches. They were unwilling to compete again. The referee announced that the Philippine team had forfeited. The audience was in an uproar because there was no competition. They wanted ticket refunds and the order was in chaos. Afterwards, the Philippine coach Delonger announced three reasons: (1) The Philippines had notified the Japanese boxing registration that there must be strict restrictions because the final was scheduled on the closing day and the final time was uncertain. However, the Japanese committee ignored it. This not only hinders world boxing rules but also does not fit Philippine customs. Now they want us to have two games in one day. This is a lack of competition knowledge. (2) The final order was originally scheduled for 4:00 PM on the 31st, but it was suddenly advanced to 1:00 PM. This is detrimental to the Philippine team. (3) If the next games want to use boxing as a championship game, the treatment of guest teams must be improved. The unfair treatment of this game should be removed immediately. Otherwise, international sports exchanges will suffer significant losses, etc.</p>

<p>Men's Volleyball Championship</p>
<h3>Chinese Volleyball Team Wins the Championship in a Thrilling Victory Over the Philippines</h3>
<p>Winning Two Sets to One After Losing the First</p>
<p>First Set: 16 to 21</p>
<p>Second Set: 21 to 16</p>
<p>Third Set: 21 to 17</p>
<p>Mission Accomplished, Flag Raising Celebration</p>
<p>This newspaper's Tokyo dispatch, dated the 30th:</p>
<p>The Chinese and Philippine volleyball teams, long-time rivals, once again competed for the championship in this year's games with equal records of three wins and one loss each. The final deciding match was full of twists and turns and dramatic changes. In the end, the Chinese team, exerting tremendous effort, won two sets to one and seized the championship. It is noted that out of the eight championships in this year's games, except for soccer, which remains to be resolved in the next games, all others have fallen into the hands of other countries. The only remaining achievement for our country is this volleyball championship.</p>
<h3>The Only Hope</h3>
<p>All other championships have gone to others. According to reason, China should have no difficulty winning the soccer championship again. However, in order to realize their long-held ambition, the Japanese would rather go against established regulations and disregard public opinion to obstruct China's efforts. The championship that China had long maintained was thus snatched away unexpectedly. The only hope lies in the volleyball event.</p>
<h3>Everyone Rejoices</h3>
<p>The patriotic fervor of the overseas Chinese was fervent. They tirelessly ran to each venue every day to cheer and support the team from the sidelines. However, the results often left them sighing in disappointment. Now that the deciding match between China and the Philippines had arrived, the anticipation for the championship was high. People came together in groups, friends and companions alike, and the cheers could be heard everywhere. When the intense match concluded and victory was achieved, they danced and celebrated, and everyone rejoiced.</p>
<h3>Watching Intently</h3>
<p>When the referees Takahashi and Toyoshima arrived, the Chinese and Philippine athletes entered the arena one after another amidst the cheers of the crowd. They engaged in light exercises to loosen their muscles, sharpening their fists and preparing to fight. They were watching intently, as if they had an eternal feud to resolve once and for all.</p>
<h3>Heartbroken</h3>
<p>As the battle began, the Filipinos served powerfully and defended nimbly, adding clean passes and powerful spikes. The score quickly increased, and soon they took a 9-0 lead. At this point, the spectators were heartbroken, despairing of the future. China's initial disadvantage was due to being too eager to win, which led to excessive moves. Later, they made a concerted effort to catch up, and Cao Tingzan finally scored two points. However, the opposing team's front row was excellent, so they switched formations with a score of 11-2.</p>
<h3>Three Heroes Emerge</h3>
<p>Our team combined its efforts and defended skillfully, and the situation gradually turned around. Cao Tingzan, Xu Heng, and Qiu Guangxie emerged as powerful spikers, constantly launching fierce attacks and closing the gap. However, the opponent's first row was too good, so the effect was limited. Nevertheless, both sides used innovative methods to counter each other, putting on a wonderful performance that was praised by the crowd. Eventually, China and the Philippines reached a tie at 16 points each.</p>
<h3>In One Breath</h3>
<p>After the tie, the Filipinos were greatly shocked and changed their strategy, focusing their attacks on the third row. China's defensive line was slightly relaxed, and loopholes appeared repeatedly. The Philippines took advantage of this and, in one breath, won the first set with a score of 21-16.</p>
<h3>The Bearing of Renowned Generals</h3>
<p>The second set saw a different situation, with our team showing its might again. The bearing of renowned generals was indeed different. With smooth cooperation, they performed several amazing spikes. Zhu Zucheng's performance was particularly outstanding, and Qiu Guangxie's serves were also effective. China took an early lead of 4-0. The Filipinos tried several times and eventually tied the score at 5-5. Both sides defended and attacked skillfully, proving themselves worthy opponents. Cao Tingzan and Chen Xiyan maintained the pressure and soon switched sides with a score of 11-7.</p>
<h3>A Sudden Turn</h3>
<p>After that, both sides' warriors were filled with spirit, and the ball flew back and forth unpredictably. Our team took advantage of the momentum and struck fearlessly. Chen Xibing made several killer shots, and the situation suddenly turned around. In an instant, they won the second set with a score of 21-16, tying the overall score at one set each.</p>
<h3>Danger Again</h3>
<p>With the score tied at one set each, the championship would be decided in the final third set. The atmosphere was tense, and the situation was serious. In the fierce battle between the two sides, China initially took a 4-2 lead. Then, they repeatedly touched the net and failed to save the ball, allowing the Philippines to gain momentum and exchange sides with a score of 11-7.</p>
<h3>Three Changes Turn the Tide</h3>
<p>At this point, there were doubts about the only hope for the championship. It was hanging in the balance, and no one knew who would win it. Fortunately, Gui Rong replaced Xu Heng, and China gained a new force, greatly strengthening their strength. All the athletes did their best and worked hard, hoping to seize a glimmer of hope in this decisive moment. Sure enough, with a difference of 7-11, they first changed the score to 11-14, then to 15-17, and finally to a tie at 17.</p>
<h3>Mission Accomplished</h3>
<p>After the three changes, the atmosphere was full of vitality. The balls spiked by Qiu Guangxie, Cao Tingzan, and Chen Xibing were as fierce as tigers, and the Filipinos could not resist and felt it difficult to defend and attack. When China reached 20 points and the Philippines reached 17 points, the Philippines still fought like a cornered beast, hoping for a miracle. However, our army's momentum had been established, and reaching the goal of victory seemed as easy as turning over a hand. Soon, they won the third set with a score of 21-17, winning the volleyball championship with an overall score of two sets to one.</p>
<h3>Flag Raising Celebration</h3>
<p>Our country's only volleyball championship had been won as desired. The Chinese flag was raised high on the giant pillars in the games' venue, fluttering in the wind and creating a magnificent scene. The entire venue stood up to pay tribute, and people from various countries congratulated each other. The victorious athletes were surrounded and could hardly get away, truly a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>The Bearing of a Hero</h3>
<p>After the volleyball match between China and the Philippines, the reporter met with the Philippine coach, Ermonte, who said that his team's cohesion was no less than that of China's, but they could not score more points due to a lack of spiking power. Comparing the strength of the three countries, Japan was the weakest, and China and the Philippines seemed equal, but China had three killers whose hits were sure to score. He added that Li Lianying's swift and unusual left-handed spikes were beyond human ability. He said that the Philippine team should admit defeat this time because they had done their best in every way. According to reports, this statement by the Filipinos did not lack the bearing of a hero.</p>
<h3>The Lineups</h3>

<p>Gui Rong (Substitute)</p>

<h3>Japan Wins Again Against the Philippines</h3>
<p>Eight to Five</p>
<p>This newspaper's Tokyo dispatch, dated the 20th: Today, Japan won again against the Philippines with a score of eight to five. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese baseball team, with its overwhelming momentum of winning every battle, defeated the Philippines again yesterday with a score of eight to five, winning the championship. The scores for each inning are as follows:</p>
<p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Score</p>
<p>Country　　　　Inning Inning Inning Inning Inning Inning Inning</p>
<p>Japan　　　　0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 7 8</p>
<p>Philippines　0 0 1 0 0 0 1 3 0 5</p>
<h3>The Philippines Displays Great Prowess</h3>
<p>At the time, the performance of one of the winning teams did not seem appropriate for a championship team, giving the Philippines a great opportunity. They started off by scoring one point in the third inning, then another point in the seventh inning, and then added three more in the eighth inning, taking a 5-0 lead.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Work Hard to Win the Championship</h3>
<p>Despite being in an unfavorable situation, the Japanese continued to work hard, hoping to recover and maintain their reputation for winning every game. In the bottom half of the eighth inning, the Japanese woke up like a sleeping lion and displayed unstoppable might. The Philippine defense line was completely broken, and they immediately began to score one point. In the ninth inning, they launched a large-scale attack, and runners continuously returned to home base. They eventually took the lead, scoring a total of seven points. As a result, the Japanese won with a score of eight to five. Overall, although the Philippines lost, their performance was better. The Philippines and Japan each had nine hits, and Japan had three errors while the Philippines only had two.</p>
<p>Not only were there five athletes, but two referees were added, turning into seven people. In our hearts, we only see China as our strong opponent. The Japanese are not worth mentioning. China has the most perfect sportsmanship, which is worthy of our admiration and sympathy. China's defeat is due to its inability to have the courage that we have and to fight not only the enemy but also the referees.</p>

<h3>Philippines Beats Japan to Win the Championship</h3>
<p>Forty-Five to Forty</p>
<p>This newspaper's Tokyo dispatch, dated the 30th:</p>
<p>The basketball finals between the Philippines and Japan drew great attention because Japan had defeated the Philippine Islands before and was expected to win again. When the match started at 7:30 PM on Friday night, the venue was packed with countless people. The referees were Tanaka and Fujimachi.</p>
<h3>The Referee Secretly Helps the Japanese to Gain Momentum</h3>
<p>At the beginning, the Japanese cooperated well and shot accurately, taking an 8-0 lead. The Philippines missed several opportunities in the first five minutes. However, the referee's decisions were chaotic and unfair, so the Philippines' opponent was not the warriors but the referee. Incidents happened repeatedly, almost causing the game to stop, and an unhappy atmosphere filled the venue. With this secret help, the Japanese won the first half with a score of 22-18.</p>
<h3>Furious and Determined to Win the Championship</h3>
<p>From the beginning of the second half, the referee became even more unreasonable, adding countless penalties. The Filipinos were furious and defended with all their might. Platt, Lasso, and Peromi fought like crazy. As expected, they turned the situation around and won the basketball championship with a score of 45-40.</p>
<h3>The Filipinos Show Dissatisfaction Despite Winning</h3>
<p>After the match, the Philippine team captain, Lasso, told reporters that the refereeing in this year's competition was the worst in history. Although we won, we are not satisfied. We respect our opponents Hua (center), Chen (right forward), Huang (center forward), Liang Zhaowen (left forward), and Chen Zhenxing.</p>
<p>In the second group of the 400-meter freestyle heat, Shi Xinglong from our country came in fourth with a time of six minutes and sixteen seconds, approximately sixty meters behind the first place.

<h3>Various Groups Host Festive Banquets for the Chinese Delegation</h3>
<p>Tokyo Overseas Chinese Club, Hiroshima School, and YMCA</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Discuss the Unfairness of the Refereeing in Ball Games and Encourage Efforts</p>
<p>Zhang Boling Says That to Seek World Peace, the Far East Problem Must Be Resolved</p>
<p>This newspaper's Tokyo dispatch, dated the 31st:</p>
<p>On the morning of the 29th, the Hiroshima Girls' School Athletic Association held a welcome reception for the female athletes from various countries at the First Girls' High School in Tokyo. Approximately sixty Japanese athletes participated. The principal, Ichikawa, delivered a welcome speech, and representatives from China and the Philippines responded. Afterwards, there were entertainment programs such as singing and dancing. Finally, the Athletic Association presented souvenirs before the event ended.</p>
<p>Tokyo Cantonese Overseas Chinese Club At the same time, the Tokyo Cantonese Overseas Chinese Club also held a reception for our country's athletes at the Chinese YMCA. There were approximately two hundred guests. Several speeches were given, mostly encouraging the athletes to continue to work hard and prepare for the next games. However, someone lamented the unfairness of the refereeing in ball games and requested that the committee raise the necessary protests.</p>
<p>Far Eastern Women's Association In the afternoon, the Far Eastern Women's Association hosted a banquet for members from China and the Philippines at the Noble School.</p>
<p>Pacific Problems Research Association The Pacific Problems Research Association also hosted a banquet for Zhang Boling in the afternoon. Zhang spoke about how the Pacific problem is currently the most important issue in the world, and the Far East problem is particularly important in international affairs. To maintain world peace, the Pacific problem must be resolved peacefully.</p>
<p>Tokyo YMCA Last night, the Tokyo YMCA hosted a simple banquet for our country's athletes, with entertainment programs such as young girls playing the piano and young children playing the violin.</p>
<h3>Review of the Four Nations' Contests (Dao Sheng)</h3>
<p>The grand and spectacular 9th Far Eastern Games concluded last night. As a result, Japan won the overall championship, China came in second, the Philippines came in third, and India came in last.</p>
<h3>The Reasons for China's Failure</h3>
<p>The Chinese team's performance, which was eagerly anticipated by the people of the whole country, was mediocre and unexpected. Although they won the second place, their results were worse than in the last games, so they had to admit defeat. However, there are two main reasons for this: (1) Our country is good at ball games, especially soccer, volleyball, and basketball, which are the most promising. However, news came that selfishness and lack of cooperation led to failure. The complete defeat of the basketball team is proof of this. (2) Japanese referees are often influenced by their emotions and forget their independent position. This has been the case in every game, but it is especially true this time, causing an unhappy atmosphere in the perfect games. Once our country's progressive class is obstructed by them, even if they strive for fairness, they will eventually fail and have to declare defeat. The illegal handling of soccer by the Japanese is clear evidence of this. From this example, the rest can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Japan's Shortcomings</h3>
<p>Japan's excellent performance and victory were expected. However, due to excessive emphasis, they did not hesitate to abandon the attitude and means of being upright and just, causing the representatives from China and the Philippines to sigh and regret. It is a great pity.</p>
<h3>The Philippines Almost Completely Lost</h3>
<p>The Philippines' talent is average. Their goal is not the championship, but to compete with China for the second place. However, they failed and fell to third place. Fortunately, they seized the basketball championship from the Japanese, avoiding a complete defeat. This is also a great fortune in misfortune.</p>
<h3>India Is Glorious Even in Defeat</h3>
<p>The Indians went to Japan with great courage and resolutely participated, fulfilling their membership duties. They put the results of victory or defeat behind them. Their display of national spirit was enough to impress the countries, and their fight for the flag was full of integrity. Their glory will last for thousands of years.</p>

<p>Venue Anecdotes (Sent by Qu from Tokyo)</p>
<h3>The Games Do Not Keep Time</h3>
<p>The games were scheduled to open at noon on the 24th, but when the noon cannon sounded, the long hand of the clock had already passed five minutes. Aside from the clanging of the phonograph records on the stage, there was no sound. A Chinese lady in the audience said with a mocking tone, "The Japanese don't keep time either." It is understandable that the affairs of the games are numerous and difficult to arrange, and it is not necessary to criticize a delay of a few minutes. However, the Japanese are known for their strict adherence to schedules for trains, ships, etc. It is no wonder that they are subject to criticism for revealing this flaw at the opening ceremony of this grand and solemn games.</p>
<h3>The Disobedient Phonograph</h3>
<p>To alleviate the audience's boredom before the opening ceremony, phonograph records were played on the sound amplifier in front of the stage. When the distinguished guests were about to take their seats, the headquarters shouted loudly to stop the phonograph. However, the driver was flustered and only made the machine louder, causing laughter throughout the venue.</p>
<h3>The Demeanor of Chinese Athletes</h3>
<p>When the athletes entered the arena in formation, the Chinese team took the lead, with Lu Ming and Li Guochen holding the flag on either side, and the Chen sisters, who were very outstanding. When the athletes took the oath, Mr. Zhang Linjia represented our country. Mr. Zhang was tall and strong with a loud voice, complementing the tall and fat Dr. Zhang Boling on the stage. The representatives from other countries such as the Philippines, India, and Japan were either unattractive or had low voices, and they were not as impressive as our country's leader.</p>
<h3>Baseball Victory Against the Philippines</h3>
<p>At 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the first day of the games, the first baseball match between China and the Philippines was held. In the fourth inning, our army had already scored three points, while the Philippine army was still at zero. Their pitcher made many mistakes, causing the catcher to sweat profusely. He suddenly disliked his glove and took it off to adjust it, then took off his helmet, not knowing where to put it. He then clamped it between his legs. His anxious situation was quite amusing. In the seventh inning of the baseball game, Feng Yuhe and Zhang Rongan of our army stole bases twice, which was very agile. In the eighth inning, the Philippine army had a full base, but Zheng Fa, the pitcher of our army, managed to survive the crisis by throwing six strikes in a row, completely wiping out the enemy. In the end, our army won against the Philippines with a score of 9-6, earning applause from the whole venue.</p>
<h3>India's Double National Flag</h3>
<p>India was a new addition to this year's games, with only three athletes. Quantity was secondary to quality. These few athletes were very popular with the audience. The opening remarks and congratulatory messages were all the same, welcoming India's new participation. However, before the opening ceremony, there was a question about the national flag. Some people thought that India was a British colony and had not yet become independent, and they were worried about the British embassy in Japan. Therefore, the British flag should be used. Others thought that Gandhi was leading the Indian people in an anti-British movement, and Gandhi's white, green, and red fan-shaped flag was the true national flag of India. As a result, the British flag was still used. Indian revolutionaries who had fled to Japan issued a statement denying that the three athletes represented India. Today (the 24th), the Indian team took a compromise approach, carrying both the British flag and Gandhi's flag, creating the strange sight of a double national flag.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Volleyball League</h3>

<h3>One Word of Wisdom by Qiushui</h3>
<p>Love is the stimulant of the heart, the anesthetic of the brain, and the hypnotic pill of common sense.</p>
<p>Lying is a fault in children, an art in suitors, a success in the unmarried, but the second nature of married men and women.</p>
<p>In principle, men are never willing to tell women the truth, even though they know that not lying is more beneficial to them.</p>
<p>Almost every man can make a woman believe that black is white, but to make her think that black is the red of a rose, one must have the artistic skill.</p>
<p>In business or in gambling, a man has strong self-control and precise planning, but on the battlefield of love, every man is like a car coming down from a high mountain, difficult to control.</p>
<p>To make a woman love you, there is a technique: focus your eyesight, your heart, and your spirit on one woman at the same time.</p>
<p>Young women like men to be dazzled when they see them, while old women like men to be encouraged when they see them.</p>
<p>Many men have an empty heart to love two women, but few have the brains to love two women at the same time.</p>
<p>Many lovers and married men and women never realize the joy of being together until they feel lonely after they leave each other.</p>
<p>Many men and women marry for convenience, not for love. Men and women who marry purely for love will never divorce.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes About Cheng Xuelou by Shiyu</h3>
<p>The first governor of my Jiangsu was Cheng Gong Xuelou. In September of the Xinhai year, Cheng Gong, following public opinion, made a sweeping reform. He remained unmoved by the seven chaos. What great merit and virtue he had for my Jiangsu! It is said that if a certain official had been the governor at that time, he would have stubbornly resisted with his own ideas, and the disaster would have been unimaginable. Now I hear that Cheng Gong has returned to the mountains, which makes people feel sad. His achievements are like his. He resigned in the second year of the Republic of China and entered the monastery. The divine dragon sees the head but not the tail. His worldly old eyes can be said to be flowerless. Someone recounted an anecdote about him, saying that Cheng Gong started his career as a county magistrate, actually appointed to a county in the three eastern provinces. At that time, he had a thorny negotiation with a certain country. The country wantonly made demands and then used intimidating means, dragging artillery to show that it would bombard the people. However, Cheng Gong did not retreat, stepped forward, and stood with his abdomen covering the muzzle of the cannon, saying, "Just bombard Cheng, it has nothing to do with the people." The people of the country were surprised and respected him, and the negotiation gave way a lot, so it was fine. The next year, the Empress Dowager enjoyed the wives of foreign ministers. During the conversation, she sighed that our country's officials were mostly afraid and unable to do their best for the people. The wife of a certain minister said, "There is now a county magistrate in a certain county in the three eastern provinces who can give up his life, not be afraid of death, and plead for the people." Because of the above, the Empress Dowager told the eunuch to find out the truth and know that it was Cheng Dequan, so she wrote down his name and promoted him out of order. After a few years, he opened his government in my Wu. Wu got this virtuous head of state as a guarantee. How lucky he was! It is a pity that he resigned so quickly. Now that the eminent monk has passed away, he has received and returned completely. The public has no regrets. Can our people not feel more grateful because of the rapid changes in the world?</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Slaughterhouse by Cheng Zhizheng</h3>
<p>On the 26th of this month, the students of the Municipal Administration Class of the third grade of Jiaotong University in this city, led by Professor Tang, visited the slaughterhouse in Hongkou. What I heard and saw is worth mentioning, so I will list it to fill this talk.</p>
<p>The smell of blood assaulted the nose. At about two o'clock, as I entered, the smell of blood made people want to vomit. At the same time, blood accumulated on the cement floor, forming a canal. All the meat supply in Shanghai mostly depends on this place. The workers came and went, looking quite anxious. My companions and I all covered our noses and passed by.</p>
<p>The Westerner received us. Soon, a Westerner came out to receive us, quite amiable and approachable. He explained various situations to us in detail, saying that this place slaughters more than 50 cattle, more than 100 pigs, and dozens of sheep every day. All kinds of meat are tested one by one. Those that are complete and flawless are classified as first-class, and those that are slightly emaciated or slightly diseased are classified as second-class. Those that are diseased are discarded. All the prepared meat products are sold in the market immediately after slaughter.</p>
<p>The Westerner led us to explain each part of the work in detail. First, we went to the leather department, where the workers scraped the meat off the skin of the cattle and then folded the skin into a rectangle and sold it to the leather factory for about 27 cents per pound. Then we entered a huge room with many slaughtered cattle hanging inside. Each one was stamped. Walking among them was like entering a forest of meat. The pigs and sheep were also prepared in the same way. After dissecting the abdomen, air was pumped into the skin to make the meat swell, and the work was completed.</p>
<p>Procedures for Slaughtering Cattle: When slaughtering cattle, the cattle's brain is first struck with an iron hammer to stun the cattle before slaughtering them, which also reduces their pain. However, a workroom contains various handguns, which are used to shoot the heads of cattle. In England, this procedure for slaughtering livestock is stipulated by law. Now, to avoid trouble, the method of shooting with bullets has been changed to striking with a hammer. However, the cattle suffer. After the cattle are killed, they are dismembered. The various tasks are completed in a short time. Because machines are not used, the efficiency is certainly not comparable to that of the Chicago slaughterhouse. (Note: I have already recorded the Chicago slaughterhouse in this publication.)</p>
<p>Cattle Poisoning Test: Meat food places the highest importance on hygiene, so poisoning testing is the most important task. The Westerner showed us the lungs of a cow with lung disease. The spots were numerous, which was frightening. If people eat it, it is unimaginable. Later, we went to visit the cattle farm, about dozens of steps away. There were many cattle stored, all prepared for execution the next day. It is said that the cattle and sheep mostly come from the Danyang and Changzhou areas. The price of each head varies, from tens of yuan to hundreds of yuan. However, they are mostly thin and pitiful. Mencius said, "Hearing its voice, one cannot bear to eat its flesh," and "I cannot bear to see its trembling." Although we came here for academic research, I am afraid that when we recall this scene in the future, we will inevitably throw down our chopsticks and stop eating. The Westerner also said that to test whether a cow is poisonous, you can first hold its horn. If it is not sick, the horn must be cool, otherwise, it must be hot. Also, the ears of normal cattle must stand upright. The ears of sick cattle often hang down, and even the hair is related. This kind of common sense identification does not require dissection to know.</p>
<p>Rest for a Day: Livestock transported to Shanghai on the same day are temporarily kept and fed in this farm because they are tired from the boat and car. It is not suitable to slaughter them until the next day. Also, the day before slaughter, they cannot be fed feed and must be allowed to go hungry before being executed. This is also a way of hygiene, but it is far from the heart of benevolence.</p>
<p>Dog Prison: In addition to the cattle farm, there is also a dog prison, mostly for foreign hunting dogs. When asked why they are here, they said, "These are dogs that have bitten people." They are detained here for ten days to test whether they have mental illness. If not, they will be released after a ten-day sentence. This thorough management cannot but impress people. At about four o'clock, we said goodbye to the instructor and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Talking About the Cuckoo by Qing</h3>
<p>The cuckoo is a migratory bird. Every spring and early summer, its voice sounds like calling "(cut wheat and plant rice)," but the old farmers in my hometown harmonize its sound into a change like "(every family grows flowers)." Because rice seedlings are not transplanted at this time, cotton seeds must also be planted, so this bird is also called "(tillage bird)," which has a profound meaning. However, there is no Duke Ye Chang in the world, so no one can translate the language of this bird.</p>
<p>According to Erya, it is also called "(Shijiu)" and "(Hug)," saying that it is the cuckoo. Other books such as Yue Ling say "(Bo Gu)," Ben Cao says "(Bo Gu)," Fang Yan says "(Ji Gu)," and some books say "(Bu Gu)," or think that they are all transliterations of cuckoo. Their saying is not true, and Jiangyi East calls it "(Huo Gu)." Guo commented that it is a dove that calls for rain, then it is mistaken for "(Bu Gu)" and regarded as the same kind as the turtledove. I don't know that its voice is very different. In the past, Yu of Deqing pointed out that the dove cannot make a nest and did not refer to it as a turtledove, but regarded the turtledove as it. Zhang Taiyan also regarded the cuckoo as a turtledove, and their loss was the same. I recited Fang Weng's poem "Early Summer" and said first (The red and purple flowers have become dust in succession, and the summer season is new in the sound of the cuckoo). Then I felt that the sound of this bird was noisy, and between the fields, the yellow clouds of wheat ridges turned into a vast expanse of blue-green in an instant, and the rice seedlings were like hair needles. Its bird shape is like "(cuckoo)," but its body is larger, its color is gray-black, and its jaw is slightly white with line patterns across its chest and abdomen. Its flight is very slow and it sometimes makes a call. The difference is that it often lives alone without a partner. After this spring plowing and summer weeding, it disappears. Some call it "(divine bird)," which is hard to believe. My friend Li Jun Shijing said that a certain Western naturalist once studied that this bird can lay eggs but cannot incubate them. When it sees eggs that have already been laid in the nests of other birds, it often takes the opportunity to also lay eggs among them, fearing that the other birds will become suspicious because of the increase in the number of eggs. It must use its claws to pick out its original eggs to cover up its tracks. When its chicks come out, the other birds know that they are not of their own kind and are unwilling to feed them. Therefore, this bird, even as a young bird, is cunning among the chicks and can exert its fat and tender wings to lift the other chicks out of their nests and push them down. Then it can eat its fill to grow up. Once its feathers are full, it flies away and lives alone. He also said that he had taken a video of the bird's bizarre transformations, which cannot be imitated by other birds. Seeing this is also enough to provide for scholars' research. It is a pity that its source cannot be clearly indicated, which is still regrettable. I therefore narrate it, and I hope that the biologists in the world will also tell me about it.</p>
<h3>The Female Knight-Errant of the Wasteland River on the Silver Screen by Bibo</h3>
<p>My writing skills are dull and I cannot rely on words to survive. Instead, I go to the market to beg for food and haggle over every penny. From morning to night, I am so noisy that people regard me as an old peddler. After retiring, I often laugh at myself when I think about it. However, compared to my friend Gu Mingdao, whose physical constitution is weak, we are actually comparable. However, he is able to write thousands of words and wait for the horse to be saddled. In the most recent year, he has completed more than ten long articles such as Female Knight-Errant of the Wasteland River, Fragrant Grass at the End of the World, Record of the Crying of the Mandarin Duck, and Continued Record of the Cuckoo. This is enough to make us admire his speed of production. Female Knight-Errant of the Wasteland River was first published in newspapers, and millions of people recited it every day. Therefore, it is even more famous in the world. Once it was printed into a book,</p>
<p>It has already been published in three editions in a few months, and its popularity is evident. Because of this, the friend Lian Yin adopted this book to compile a film drama that is both positive and appropriate. The preparation and production took half a year and it was divided into four episodes: Havoc in Baolin Temple, Burning of the Han Family Village, Breaking the Beautiful Woman's Tower, and Double Investigation of White Bull Mountain. In each episode, there are clues that echo each other, woven with scenes of fragrant romance. The film emphasizes martial arts, but it must also take into account both expressive art. Ms. Xu Qinfang plays the protagonist. Her beauty and liveliness make her a pleasant and enjoyable role. For the sake of solemnity, Chen Kangran, Zheng Yisheng, and Shang Guanwu jointly directed the film, and the shooting method is particularly novel and unparalleled. The first and second episodes of the film have been scheduled to be shown for six consecutive days at the Central Grand Theater starting on the 30th of this month, and a stage play will also be performed, in which the characters in the play will perform on stage with melodious and circuitous lyrics, sword light and sword shadow martial arts, mysterious and unpredictable scenery, and scenes of joy and sorrow. I would like to tell you that since you have a film with a majestic dragon-like aura, you will also have a grand opera with a magnificent dragon and tiger leaping performance. How wonderful is it to have such a feast for your ears and eyes?</p>
<h3>Zhangshan Cloud Mist Tea by Diehua</h3>
<p>Wuyuan is famous in the world for its tea production. Zhangshan green tea is the best quality among Wuyuan tea. Although its taste is superior, Longjing is inferior to it. At the top of Zhangshan Mountain, Bagua Peak, there are several wild tea trees growing horizontally on dangerous cliffs. The mountain people call it Cloud Mist Tea because the peak is often shrouded in clouds and mist, just like Mount Lu, which cannot be seen in its true form. The tea leaves are white in color, soft in texture, and pointed and long in shape. The taste is clear, sweet, and has a strange fragrance that is different from other teas. The mountain people pick it when the fog is transparent, using a long rope to tie a bamboo chair. The picker wraps the rope around his body and ties it in the chair. Several other people hold the long rope from the top of the cliff and slowly lower it to the tea. After picking, they pull it up. Although the method is simple, it is quite laborious. The mountain people hide this tea deeply and do not give it to people easily. It is not easy to buy with money. It is said that this tea is effective for treating heart and stomach problems and other diseases.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (204) by Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Emerald Hairpins and Pearl Hair Ornaments, Beautiful Women Return to Good Scholars; Green House and Red Tent, Famous Prostitutes Marry Famous Families</p>
<p>That Zhu Feng saw me whispering in Ruiyun's ear, and as soon as Ruiyun left, she said, "Second Young Master, are you asking her? You must not say that I told you. They will complain about me. According to the rules, sisters cannot talk nonsense about who is getting married and who is not in front of guests. I said, "Don't worry, I will definitely not say that you reported it. Besides, what you reported is not necessarily true. I have already explored her tone." After I finished eating, I came to the room next door. At that time, Ruiyun's performance was also over and she was changing clothes. I wanted to ask her what was going on, but people kept coming in and out of the room, and there was no chance to talk to her alone. Later, Ruiyun shouted that she was hungry and wanted to ask them to buy some snacks. I said, "I didn't eat enough just now either. Let's go to Yipinxing to eat big dishes. After eating the big dishes, I will go back." Ruiyun said yes without hesitation and called Ah Jin to accompany me. She also hurriedly went to change clothes. The big aunt was not in charge of business, so no one could stop her. Besides, with Ah Jin accompanying her, it would not violate their rules. Originally, Ah Jin was very helpful to Ruiyun. Wasn't there a disturbance about the Hou Party in the Guangxu Dynasty a few years ago? Ruiyun's room was like a small Qing Dynasty court. Only Ah Jin was like Weng Tonghe, Master Weng. The rest of the people in the room were all Ronglu and Yuan Shikai. Moreover, Master Weng was from Changshu, and Ah Jin was also from Changshu, which made them even more similar. We then took Master Weng to Yipinxing. No matter what we said, Ah Jin would never spread rumors. Ruiyun was indeed a little hungry. I went specifically to inquire about news. I intended to ask Ruiyun after she finished eating the big dishes, but just as she was eating soup, Ruiyun said to Ah Jin, "Just now, Second Young Master said that people outside are talking about someone named Zhao and someone named Wu." Ah Jin casually said, "Really?" I took the opportunity to ask, "Who is it, Zhao or Wu? Didn't you promise to tell me?" Ruiyun put the spoon in the soup dish and said, "I don't even know myself. Now my body is like in an auction house. Whoever bids the most will take it away." Later, according to the mutual accounts of Ruiyun and Ah Jin, there were originally three guests who wanted to marry Ruiyun at the same time: one was Zhao Qi, one was Wu San, and one was Zhuang Da. Zhao Qi was the youngest, only in his twenties. Wu San was a little older than Zhao Qi and had not reached forty years old. Only Zhuang Da was already in his forties this year. However, Zhao Qi was only willing to pay three thousand yuan because the economic power was still in the hands of his father. Three thousand yuan was still勉力available for籌措. Wu San was willing to pay four thousand yuan, but Wu San said that he was a little bit picky and not straightforward. The big aunt meant that she wanted five thousand yuan. However, although Zhuang Da also bargained for four thousand yuan, it seemed that he could manage to raise the full five thousand yuan because he was a famous wealthy man in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>The Lilicent Rate for the Previous Two Days</h3>
<p>Many Sources, Continued Low Cent Rate</p>
<p>Special Settlement at the End of the Month</p>
<p>As usual, this newspaper took a day off on the Fifth-Thirty Day and was unable to announce the market conditions on that day. Therefore, this newspaper adds the following settlement draft for yesterday's transactions. It is appropriate that yesterday happened to be the end of the month and the day before yesterday was also the small end of the month, and that the amount of receipts and payments should be as high as any other period. The cent rate continued to fall, probably due to the many sources.</p>
<p>Cent Rate Price (Foreign Cent): The forenoon market the day before yesterday was 7 cents, 1 point, 8 mils and 5 micromils, and the afternoon market was 7 cents, 1 point, 8 mils and 3 mils and 7 micromils. The result was a greater drop of 6 mils and 2 micromils. The forenoon and afternoon markets yesterday were both 7 cents, 1 point, 8 mils and 2 mils and 5 micromils, which was 1 mil and 2 micromils smaller than the afternoon market the day before yesterday.

The difference between the two markets was 6 points. The bank's list was 1 cent with a markup of 45 cents. The silver cent yesterday was 1 cent and 7 points in the forenoon market and 1 cent and 2 points in the afternoon market. The trend was even weaker. The bank's list was 7 points with a markup of 89 cents. From a general perspective, the silver root steps up and down, and it is not easy to make a conclusion at once.</p>

Copper coins were still 410 skewers.</p>

<h3>Silver Split in May Was Higher Than in Previous Months</h3>
<p>Due to the overall weakness in silver supply in the past four months of this year, silver splitting has been difficult to turn upwards, so the monthly total is less than the statutory two liang. Only in the previous month, due to the occasional infighting among colleagues in the financial industry, did they compete with each other to hold interest rates, resulting in a rise of one or two cents. As a result, the total for the whole month was 4 liang and 0.05 points. Calculated on a thirty-day basis, the daily average is 1 cent, 3 mils and 5 micromils. Because last month had thirty-one days, if calculated on a thirty-one day basis, it would only account for 1 cent, 3 mils and 0.645 points per day. As such, the proposed opening interest rate benchmark for this month is probably around 4 liang and 95% off. Let's record this to see if it works.</p>
<h3>The Time for Opening the Silver Split is Earlier</h3>
<p>Set to Open at Eight O'Clock</p>
<p>Now that the days are long and the nights are short, the opening time of the silver split in the currency market was previously 8:30 AM because the days were short. Recently, at 8:30 AM, the morning market trading of various businesses had been going on for a long time. It was not too late, so it was necessary to bring it forward. Yesterday, the market committee revealed a report that the time for the opening of the market will be brought forward by half an hour to 8:00 AM starting from June 2nd (starting from June 1st, because the Summer Festival is a day off). Yin split will be opened to meet the needs of the market and benefit the trade of various industries.</p>
<h3>Gold Price Surges Past 44 Taels</h3>
<p>Reaching a Peak of 44 Taels and 9 Mace</p>
<p>A Frenzied Rise of 11 Taels and 2 Mace in Two Days</p>
<p>Gold Exchange Closed for Two Days Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>Newspaper Suspends Publication Due to Sharp Price Increase on May 30th Commemorating the Tragic Incident, This Newspaper Suspended Publication for One Day. The Fluctuation in Gold Bidding Reached a Remarkable 13 Taels. The Latent Peak Has Surpassed the 540 Taels Threshold, An Astonishing Price Unprecedented in History. This Was Due to the Sharp Contraction of Large Loans and Foreign Exchange. The Opening Price Was 532 Taels. Later, Buyers Displayed Vigorous Activity, Reaching 44 Taels.

The Stormy Situation Was Extremely Difficult to Predict, Presenting a Chaotic Scene.</p>
<p>The Weekend Situation Eased Somewhat. Yesterday, the Gold Exchange Only Operated in the Morning Session. Gold Bidding Continued to Rise, Hovering Around 540 Taels, Occasionally Retracing 2 or 3 Taels. Although the Turbulence Was Not as Severe as the Previous Day, It Was Still Chaotic. The Foreign Exchange Rate Increased by One Notch, and the Internal Market Showed Slight Improvement. Banks Were Active, But More Peaceful Compared to the Previous Day. There Seemed to Be More Demand Among Dealers, But People Were Inevitably Anxious. Despite the Continued Rise in Large Loan Rates Early in the Morning, The Market Opened Higher. Buyer Activity Reached 42 Taels and 5 Mace. Later, the Trend Reversed Due to Negative Sentiment, and Sellers Seized the Opportunity, Retreating to the 40 Taels Level. By Noon, It Had Exited This Level Again.</p>
<p>The Opening Price Increased by 1 Tael and 5 Mace. The British Silver Rate Had Recovered by One-Eighth. The Forward Rate Increased by One-Quarter. There Was No Market for Silver Prices.

The Cable Announcement Showed an Increase of 25 American Cents and Half a Yuan. The Japanese Gold Rate Decreased by 1 Mace and a Half, Dropping to Around 41 Taels. Internal Foreign Exchange Rates First Tightened and Then Fell. The September British Gold Rate Between Banks Was 8 Pence and a Half, and American Dollars Were 41 Yuan and 375 Cents. It Was Said That Yuan Cheng Yong and Others Were Inclined to Sell. The Rumor of Reintroducing Silver Tax in the Market Further Depressed Sentiment, Suddenly Plunging to 38 Taels and 2 Mace. Afterward, The Price Hovered Around 40 Taels, With a Fluctuation of About 2 Taels. After 11 O'Clock, The Situation Seemed to Ease. Sumitomo Absorbed August Japanese Gold at 1 Tael, 1 Mace, 9 Fen, and 2.5 Li, and Also Issued British Gold at 8 Pence and 2.5 Li. Therefore, The Price Rose Leisurely, Jumping Up 2 or 3 Taels. By Noon, It Was 545 Taels and 8 Mace, An Increase of 2 Taels and 3 Mace Compared to the 30th.</p>
<p>The Announced Price Was Pressed Down to 53 Taels. The Highest Price in Half a Day Was 42 Taels and a Half, and the Lowest Price Was 38 Taels and 2 Mace, With a Fluctuation of 4 Taels and 3 Mace.

The Morning Price Was Suppressed by 51 or 2 Taels, and the Noon Price Was Pressed Down to 51 Taels. The Japanese Gold Rate Was Lowered by 1 Mace and a Half. The Registration and Supplementary Water Together Accounted for 42 Taels.</p>
<p>Transactions Among Dealers Were Not Very Active. The Volume of Transactions Was Not Large Because Today and Tomorrow (June 1st and 2nd) Are Sundays and Bank Holidays. Therefore, the Gold Exchange on Jiujiang Road and the Goods Gold and Silver Department Market Will Also Be Closed for Two Days, And Will Reopen as Usual on the 3rd. Therefore, Dealers Do Not Dare to Do Too Much, And Should Generally Close Out Positions. Ji Zhiyong, Yuan Mao, Yong Chengchang, Yuan Xingyong, Yuan Yuyong, Taixing, Yuantai, Fuyu, Etc. All Bought In. Wanxing, Shunli, Dadecheng, Fuchang, Etc. Had Mixed Activity. Yuancheng Yong, Yu Da, Yuankangxiang, Etc. All Sold Out. Retail Orders Were Offered and Sought Alternately, In Limited Quantities. The Dalian Gang Altogether Had More Than 1,500 Orders, Which Roughly Evened Out. The Guangdong Gang Had Few Transactions, Mainly Acting as Agents for Customers.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Internal Market Still Tight</h3>
<p>Hedging Is Approaching</p>
<p>The Spot and Forward Japanese Gold Rates Have Both Decreased by 1 Mace and a Half</p>
<p>On the 30th, The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's Quoted Rate Suddenly Contracted by More Than Three Notches. The British Gold Rate Was 75 American Cents and 1 Yuan and 5 Li. The Five-Day Exchange Rate Increased by 4 Fen and 5 Li. The Other Exchange Rates Also Contracted. The Internal Market Was Very Chaotic. The Market Was Very Tight in the Morning, And Suddenly Eased in the Afternoon. Therefore, Hedging Is Approaching. The Overall Market Was Very Turbulent, With Fluctuations of 12 or 13 Taels. However, Chinese Merchants Sold British Gold to Hedge Orders, Which Seemed More Cost-Effective Than a Few Days Ago. The Market Situation on the Weekend Was Opposite to That of the Previous Day. Yesterday, Only the Morning Market Was Open. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's Quoted Foreign Exchange Rate Suddenly Recovered by One Notch Because the Large Loan Rate Had Recovered. The British Gold Rate Increased by 25, Which Was 1 Shilling, 7 Pence, and 875,000th. The American Dollar Rate Increased by 5 Jiao, Which Was 40 Yuan and 2 Jiao and 5 Fen.

The Hong Kong Exchange Rate Decreased by 5 Qian, Which Was 81 Taels and 5 Qian. However, The Bank's Internal Market Was Still Stable. Banks Had Slight Activity, But Gold Bidding Was Still Rising. Therefore, The Closing Price at Noon Decreased by 0625 Shillings to 125, Decreased by 125 American Dollars, And Increased by 125 Japanese Gold Compared to the 30th. The Forward Rate, However, Decreased by 375 Because the Swap Rate Was Especially Large, Which Was 75 to Half a Fen. However, Hedging Is Gradually Approaching. Chinese Merchants Who Purchased Bills and Sold Orders in the Past Can Still Make a Profit by Hedging Back Now. Yesterday's Market Situation Seemed to Be the Opposite of the Previous Day's Market Situation. 200,000 Pounds of British Gold Were Traded. Chinese Merchants Sold 40,000 to 50,000 Pounds and Purchased 100,000 Pounds. Banks Such as Zhengjin, Hong Kong and Shanghai, and Sumitomo Purchased. Mitsui, Huabi, and North Korea Sold. The Banks Also Made Tens of Thousands of Pounds and 100,000 American Dollars. Gold Dealers Sold 100,000 Dollars. Mitsui Absorbed, While Japanese Gold Sold Tens of Thousands of Dollars, Which Mitsui Paid In. However, the Market Is Still Inevitably Confusing and Uncertain.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Suddenly Turns Upward</h3>
<p>Raw Cotton Rises, Short Positions Increase</p>
<p>The Yarn Market Rose Sharply and the Momentum Was Strong. The Sharp Contraction of Bills and the Sharp Rise of Raw Cotton Stimulated the Yarn Market. People's Hearts Were Touched by It. Short Sellers Panicked. At the Same Time, The Osaka Yarn Factory Proposed Reducing Work and Limiting Production Due to Huge Losses. Sellers Were Even More Constrained. A Large Account Turned from Short to Long, And the Contract Amount Was Extremely Large. The Chips in the Market Were Absorbed By It, And the Situation Became More Tense. Therefore, The Market Had An Outbreak. However, Most Short Positions Still Mainly Shorted Due to War Clouds. The Overall Situation Is Difficult to Fall in a Short Time. The Sentiment Is Exceptionally High.</p>
<p>The Human Mark Increased by More Than 12 Taels. The Exchange Human Mark's Morning Market Opened with Strong Market Sentiment. Sellers Were Lacking, And The Price Rose Two or Three Sessions. Due to the Soaring Raw Cotton Prices, And A Large Account Purchased, The Rising Trend Became More Pronounced. As a Result, Prices Rose 1 Tael and 4 Qian, 1 Tael and 5 Qian, 1 Tael and 7 Qian to 2 Taels. In the Afternoon, The Market Sentiment Was Still Firm. Actual Sales Were Good. The 66th Number Continued To Purchase 2,200 Bales in the Morning and Afternoon. Therefore, The Market Was Very Good. Each Month Rose Another 4, 5, or 6 Qian. The Trading Volume for the Whole Day Was 20,400 Bales. The Closing Prices of The Human Mark Are Recorded on the Left.</p>

<h3>The Cotton Market Is More Charming</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange Rates Repeatedly Contracted... Low Inventories... Few Sources</p>
<p>The Sharp Rise in The Cotton Market Was Unprecedented This Year. Such A Situation Was Possible to Realize Earlier. The May Term Was Oppressed by The Japanese Dongmian, So It Has Been Hovering Around 5 Taels and 5 or 6 Qian. Recently, Due to The Sharp Contraction of Foreign Exchange Rates, Low Inventories, High Wuhan Prices, And Few Sources, The Market Was Even More Difficult to Fall Due to These Major Reasons. The Wuhan Gang Held On Tightly. Sellers Had A Poor View of the Environment. The Intention of Covering Short Positions Evolved Into This Sharp Rise. It Should Also Be Noted That The Wuhan Gang and The Japanese Dongmian Made A Profit and Seized the Opportunity to Sell About 20,000 Loads in the Market. However, Both Short and Long Positions Were Abnormal, So Prices Showed A Crazy State.</p>
<p>The Han Mark Left the 7 Tael Level. The Exchange Han Mark Opened in the Morning with Retail Traders Covering Short Positions. Buyers Were Lacking, And Prices Rose 5 Qian in Each Month for Two or Three Sessions, Then Rose Another 1 or 2 Qian. As a Result, Prices Rose 6 Qian to 8 Qian and a Half in Each Month. In the Afternoon, Dongmian and The Han Gang Took the Opportunity to Close Positions and Fell Back by 1 Qian to 2 Qian and a Half. The Situation Eased Slightly.

<h3>The 5th Month Yarn and Cotton Delivery Process</h3>
<p>Yarn Volume 7,650 Bales... Cotton 24,600 Loads</p>
<p>The Human Mark Delivery Price Was 154 Taels. The Human Mark Market in May Was Not Brilliant. The Situation Was Poor, And Actual Sales in Various Parties Were Sluggish. The Customer Gangs Were Not Excited. Therefore, Prices Showed A Sluggish State. Sellers Exerted Great Pressure and Were In Danger of Falling. However, Buyers and Permanent Major Manufacturers Had A Very Strong Attitude and Held On Tightly. The Sellers Were Also Major Manufacturers. Both Sides Had Strong Strength, So Prices Maintained A Long-Term Holding Pattern And Hovered Around 153 Taels. At the End of the Month, The Guangdong Gang Suddenly Launched and Purchased More Than 20,000 Bales of 10-Count Yarn. People's Hearts Were Excited. The Price Reached 154 Taels. Later, There Were Still Many Long Positions Being Released by Those Who Delivered Goods. The Market Eased Slightly. The Delivery Volume Was A Total of 7,650 Bales. The Price Was 154 Taels.

Therefore, Prices Fell from 35 Taels and 6 Qian and a Half to 4 Taels and 5 Qian and a Half. The Last Session Was 34 Taels and 99 Qian and a Half. The Delivery Price Was 36 Taels and 5 Qian.

<p>Modern Danish Literature (Continued)</p>
<h3>Zhao Jingshen's Lecture at Fudan University</h3>
<p>Chen Xiemeng</p>
<p>Tang Zengyang's Notes</p>
<p>Among those who are not of the (Jutland School) type, the first we must mention is Nexo.</p>
<p>Nexo (Martin Andersen Nexo, 1864) his appearance represents another aspect of Danish thought, because his ideas are completely incompatible with those of the (Jutland School). He was born in Copenhagen, living in extreme poverty. At the age of nine, he moved with his parents to the island of Bornholm, the island where his father was born. After Nexo was confirmed, he worked as a shepherd and as a shoemaker's apprentice, but because he disliked being cooped up indoors, he later worked as a bricklayer's assistant and transporting bricks and tiles. Later, he entered Askov Folk High School. He loved to read and gained some knowledge, then began to write. At this time, he was nearly thirty years old. In 1898, he wrote a collection of short stories, *Shadows*, depicting the customs and conditions of Italy and Spain. In 1901, he wrote *The Frank Family*. In 1902, he wrote *Dry Rain*, which depicts darkness and pessimism using the techniques of naturalism, but these are not his representative works. His masterpiece is *Pelle the Conqueror* (I-IV, 1906-1910). The entire book consists of four volumes. The first volume depicts his childhood memories living in a stone house on Bornholm Island. The second volume depicts his work as an apprentice. The third volume depicts the spirit of resistance. The author created a protagonist who, according to the author himself, not only faithfully and kindly extols the traditional virtues of the poor but also portrays their ability to preserve the meaning of humorous conversation and happiness, as well as the beauty of life. The author gained international fame for *Pelle the Conqueror* and was able to lead workers towards the path of enlightenment. Nexo also has another important work, *Ditte, Daughter of Man*. In this book, the author writes about Ditte's story of being a female Pelle, which is even darker than Pelle's story. She is a pitiful maidservant whose life of hardship from cradle to grave is concentrated in her, causing endless pity.</p>
<p>Kund Hjorto (1869) writes novels that mostly depict rural squires. He was also a farmer's son. His first novel was *Neighbors*, published in 1901. Since then, he has published *Rasmus* (1909) and *Inside and Outside the Parish* (1919). His writings mostly involve social and psychological ideas with penetrating observation. He writes dialogue most realistically for women and children, but his books are difficult to read. In 1904 he wrote *Ashes and Stars*, in 1905 he wrote *Two Worlds*, and in 1906 he wrote *Hawo Daoko*. This trilogy is full of fantasy and passion. In 1921, he wrote *Faust*, a book containing many philosophical elements and questions about life and death. The author's novels are mostly short stories and have very few editions. For example, in China, each edition of a published book typically has around 2,000 copies, but his novels only have 500 to 800 copies per edition. Because they do not attract people's attention, the author is not easily famous in his own country, but he is very famous abroad.</p>
<p>Atto Rnuny (1874) wrote *The White Cruiser* in 1906, *Shadows of the Past* in 1909, *The Great Caravan* in 1914, *The Secret Chamber* in 1919, *The Isle of Bliss* in 1919, and *When the Water Settles* in 1922. He has many works and skillfully uses suspense, which is strong and surprising. The key to the author's novels is a tight interweaving, a kind of popular appeal that provides entertainment for the general public. For example, *The White Cruiser* and *The Great Caravan* can easily arouse a kind of stimulation in readers. There are many places in the book that show action, which is very noisy, like China's *Shi Gong An* and *Water Margin*. His novels, of course, belong to the old side: the old being noisy, and the new being silent and profound in people's views.</p>
<p>Harald Kidde (1878-1918) his descriptions penetrate to the depths, able to fully understand people with different thoughts and are very sympathetic to those who suffer. His writing style is solemn and contemplative, and he has many works. (1) *Allegorical Paintings* (1900) is a collection of allegories. (2) *Aage and Else* (1902-1903) is a long Danish nursery rhyme story. The book writes about a dead warrior who is resurrected because of his lover's grief, but soon dies again, revealing the victory of death over life. The protagonist, Tne Tavsen, is a melancholic patient who sees many lovers die for him and wants to revive lull wedev to make him live, but fails. The tragedy ends from this point forward. (3) *Castles in the Air* (1904). (4) *The Blind Man* (1906). (5) *The Law* (1909). (6) *Others* (1909). (7) *The Blessed* (1910). ((6) and (7) are optimistic). (8) *Heroes* (1912). (9) *Hunger* (1918). He abandoned theology in his early years but loved religious life and worked as a pitiful and contemptible teacher. Later, on a remote island, he proclaimed the light of God and the welfare of the people, abandoning his own dreams of happiness. *Hunger* depicts events in Sweden. The ideas in the book are difficult to unravel. The author died of the plague a few weeks after the book was published, at only forty-one years old.</p>
<p>Aage van Koht (1877) writes novels of savage decadence, including *Palace of Lichens* (I-III, 1908), which depicts the sinking of a warship and is full of terror and despair.</p>
<p>There are not as many female Danish writers as there are Swedish writers, and they are not as important, but there are also a few who are very famous.</p>
<p>Gyrith Semche (1866) is famous for her historical novels. Her most famous work is *Edwardsgaue* (I-IV, 1900-1912). Karin Michaelis (1872) her most famous works are psychological novels, including *The Broken Glass* (1924).</p>
<p>Thit Jensen (1876) spent some time in her youth living as a farmer. Her thoughts are very pure and full of passion. She feels that a fallen life is not worthy of being human. Later, she wrote a play, *The Stork*. It is a bird name in Nordic countries, according to legend, that this bird often brings babies to mothers. The play promotes birth control (To be continued).</p>

<p>Youth Corner</p>
<p>(Uncle Wen) Soniya in *Uncle Vanya*</p>
<p>Among the foreign literary writers I know, Chekhov of Russia is one of my favorites.</p>
<p>I haven't read many of his short stories, but every time I read one, it always leaves me with a very deep impression. His plays are much fewer in quantity than his novels, and I've read even fewer of them, but these few alone are enough to make me reluctant to put them down. His plays are written with the same skill and pen as his novels, so in them, as in his novels, you can't expect to find any legendary heroes, outstanding geniuses, or peerless beauties. What you see are just ordinary characters, characters that you can often find among your family members, among your friends, and around you if you pay a little attention. The content is just fragmented pieces of ordinary life's trivialities, reflecting the confusion and sadness of Russia at the end of the 19th century.</p>
<p>Works of this kind of subject matter move more or less readers of that time and modern readers. Once I heard the news that the works of my beloved playwright were being staged, it was truly something that made me ecstatic. Despite the inconvenience of transportation during the streetcar and bus strikes, it was absolutely unbearable for me not to go see the Xinyou Theatre Troupe's *Uncle Vanya*.</p>
<p>I don't want to criticize their performance this time now. Fortunately, the audience who has watched their previous performances, especially last year's *Dog's Dance*, has a public opinion. I just want to write down the unspeakable melancholy I felt when I walked home under the cold moonlight, which was not quite full, and on that desolate and mysterious street after watching the play that day. This melancholy was what I expected to receive before watching the play.</p>
<p>In *Uncle Vanya*, except for the two insignificant workers, everyone is living (miserable and tragic lives, pitiful and heartbroken people). Helen, Vanya, and Serebryakov go without saying, but even that professor who was envied by Vanya for saying (his romantic luck is so good, even the imperial bliss enjoyed by Emperor Tang in the past was no more than that), does he not have his sorrow?</p>
<p>Yes, everyone is a pitiful and heartbroken person, but I don't know why I would feel deep sympathy for Soniya (because of her ordinary appearance, no one loves). No, I actually fell in love with her.</p>
<p>Her life, her experiences, everything about her seemed somewhat familiar to me. She plucked at the strings of my heart, she stirred up my sorrow.</p>
<p>Yes, she is not just a hardworking and virtuous country girl, she has her own greatness. She cannot get used to (this desolate and lonely time, not meeting a decent person, only seeing this group of listless and lifeless things drifting around and saying boring things, knowing nothing but eating, drinking, and sleeping, bottom ghosts). She naturally wants to be happy like (seeing the moon come up in the dark night) to love that young doctor Zhao (so outstanding, so beautiful, so interesting, so lovely). Look how much she loves him. In the first act, in front of Dr. Zhao, she praised his enthusiasm and contributions to the forest, saying again and again that he said how the forest... (He said the forest would...). It flowed like reciting a running account. This can be imagined as a pitiful little girl reciting her lover's daily words in front of her bed every night before going to bed, word for word, once, twice, countless times, to replace her evening prayers.</p>
<p>In the second act, when she advises Dr. Zhao not to drink anymore, she is truly suffering. She truly loves him, she does not want him to (learn the behavior of those inferior people who drink and gamble), she does not want him to (destroy himself), but she is afraid of being presumptuous to say such immeasurable words in front of him. The pain of unrequited love.</p>
<p>She hesitantly and vaguely pretends to say that a friend or sister loves him to inquire about his tone, but the result is (there is no interest at all, his heart, his soul is still estranged from me, but how do I feel a bit of inexplicable happiness? I can't figure out what this is.)</p>
<p>This is a contradiction, but this is life.</p>
<p>If you fall in love with someone, you like to be with him or her, just like Soniya said to Dr. Zhao (It's rare for you to spend the night here.) (When you've finished seeing the patients, make sure to come back here for lunch.) (When will you come again... don't take a month, okay?). But when you are really together, you see that the other person (has no interest at all) in you, you will feel bored, you will feel sad, and at the same time, you will feel interested, like Soniya, savoring every move of Dr. Zhao, as if (I can still feel his voice vibrating in the air now.) (As if I hear him next to me all the time, I still feel his hand holding my hand tightly.) This is a contradiction, this cannot be explained by reason.</p>
<p>She loves him so passionately. In the third act, she said to her stepmother (I have loved him for six years, I love him more than I love my mother, but he never looks at me, the person in my eyes is not in his eyes.) She also said (I can't respect myself anymore, my heart is uncertain, I have no idea.)</p>
<p>Her stepmother promised to help her ask him to find out a little bit of his tone. She said (We just need to know if he has feelings or not, if not, then he must not come here in the future.)</p>
<p>The result is that she knows from her stepmother's mouth that he really (has no interest at all). She is deeply sinking into the abyss of despair.</p>
<p>But look, how does she solve her troubles?</p>
<p>In the fourth act, when she persuades her uncle to take out morphine, she says (My life is probably more bitter than yours, but I don't let go, I endure my pain and will continue to endure it as long as I have a breath left here.) She also said (Let's do something.)</p>
<p>(Let's do something, let's do something.) This is the author Chekhov using Soniya's mouth to say his own doctrine, using (work) to forget (distress). To me, this is a great revelation about life.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people say that the author is pessimistic and negates life, but at least in this play *Uncle Vanya*, he is optimistic and affirms life. Listen to Soniya's words (What can we do? We have to live our lives. We have to live those long days and long nights that follow. We have to patiently endure the tribulations destined for us. We have to take advantage of the present, just like we will when we are old, to work tirelessly for others. When our time comes</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>We must die quietly, and when we get there, up there in heaven, we will declare the suffering and torment we have endured... then God will have mercy on us. Ah, we must see that bright and radiant life, we will rejoice and feel that now our troubles will fade away with a smile, and then we will rest... We will hear the voices of the angels, we will see the paradise as radiant as jewels, we will see all sins and all our pains melt into the great love that permeates heaven and earth. Our life will be as calm as an ancient well, as gentle as spring, and as sweet as honey. I believe... my poor Uncle Vanya, you have never tasted what happiness is, but wait, we will rest...)</p>
<p>In this world, perhaps there are people who are as distressed and pitiful as Soniya. I hope they will take a look at the great *Uncle Vanya*, which can give them some comfort and help them get rid of some distress.</p>
<p>Daxia Affiliated Public Night School</p>
<h3>Holds Mandarin Speech Contest</h3>
<p>The most number of out-of-school workers are in a corner of Western Shanghai. The school, in view of this, has achieved great success since its establishment. This spring, under the charge of Mr. Xu Zexiang and Mr. Zhu Ruoxi, the number of students has reached more than 150. The development of the school is quite impressive. Special attention is paid to the infusion of party ideas and extracurricular training. In order to promote the national pronunciation, the school held a Mandarin speech contest for all students in the Daxia Auditorium at 7 pm yesterday (the 29th), and invited Ms. Liu Shuzhao, Ms. Chen Shijian, Mr. Yang Bingyan, Mr. Liu Ziquan, and others to be judges. More than 100 people attended. After Principal Xu Zexiang presided over the ceremony, the speech began. The workers and students in the class had sharp diction, which was really unexpected. The topics, such as hard work and workers' lives, were novel in meaning and especially rare in public schools. As a result, Wang Changhong, Tao Weide, Xin Zhihong, and others won prizes.</p>
<h3>Overview of Geological Research in China</h3>
<p>Ye Liangfu, Geological Researcher at the Academia Sinica (2) Practical Contributions</p>
<p>This item is not easy to explain in detail because many technical terms are needed, so I can only talk about it roughly.</p>
<p>Judging from the surveys and research of the past ten years or so, although China's land is large and there are many types of minerals, the quantity is really too small. Only coal and iron are relatively abundant, but there is not as much as foreigners have speculated. The reserves of coal are about 210,000 billion tons (217,626 billion tons), of which anthracite is 400 billion tons (43,593 billion tons), bituminous coal and sub-bituminous coal are 170,000 billion tons (173,465 billion tons), lignite is 500 billion tons (568 billion tons), and it ranks fourth in the world compared with the world and the country (after the United States and Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom). It is considered the first in the Far East. Important coalfields are of course in Zhili, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, and the three northeastern provinces. There are 950 billion tons of iron ore. Important iron ore is in these provinces of Fengtian, Hebei, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Jiangxi. It ranks first among the Pacific Rim countries. If China's industry develops, it will only be enough for its own use for two or three hundred years.</p>
<p>In addition, there are only a few famous producing areas for antimony, tin, mercury, gold, tungsten, manganese, copper, zinc, and lead. It is still necessary to consider whether other scattered small mines can be utilized.</p>
<p>As for geological history, China is very complete from the oldest to the newest strata. The changes in land and sea and the changes in organisms in each era have been roughly understood. What is most lacking is the detailed geological structure of each province. This depends on someone's talent to do long-term work to understand.</p>
<p>In short, there are limited opportunities for the development of domestic industry and the need for specialized knowledge. Although there are results of work, few people use them, so the effectiveness of applying what you have learned is not obvious, which is a pity. Just in terms of mineral research, I dare say that the existing achievements and the degree of research seem to have exceeded what is needed domestically, but we are still moving forward, preparing materials for others to use.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of indirect contribution, that is, the spirit and achievements of the geological community in researching academics according to the track have actually aroused specialized talents in other sciences to also work. In recent years, domestic scientific research丨especially natural science丨has achieved some results. This is also one of the reasons.</p>
<p>(3) Research Talents</p>
<p>In the earliest period, there were only three or four geological talents in China who had returned from studying abroad. Subsequently, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce of Beijing established the Geological Research Institute (Higher Vocational School). Three years later, it taught 22 people, two-thirds of whom served at the Beijing Geological Survey and most of them were sent abroad. Since then, Peking University has also run a geology department, and more than 100 people have graduated successively. There are also several people in various research institutions who have gone abroad to study. In addition, Central University, Sun Yat-sen University, Yenching University, and Shanxi University are mostly educating geological professionals there.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say that there are several difficulties in studying geology in China. (1) There are too few leaders who can truly guide research. I am referring to leaders who are well-versed in research and have a wealth of knowledge, not leaders who are good at raising funds and socializing with all parties. Therefore, many people with aspirations to do research are mostly filling the role of pioneers and inevitably take detours to seek research success. In addition, it is difficult for the latecomers to gain much. Some people say that foreigners can be hired to guide this, although it is a way, but you must know that if you do not have considerable knowledge to control the foreigners, it is difficult for them to concentrate on guiding. Those who are really knowledgeable and willing to come to China also have their own purposes. (2) The funds for research institutions cannot be issued as planned, and those who do things cannot proceed boldly. (3) Now the local areas are too unstable and there are too many bandits, so it is impossible to calmly and smoothly go to the field for research. To improve future achievements, I can only hope that these difficulties will gradually decrease.</p>

<p>Discovery of a New Planet - Pluto</p>
<p>The new construction of the Nanjing Qintian Mountain Meteorological Observatory. According to records, 1500 years ago, the Song Dynasty established the Sun Observation Platform in Taicheng. In the Yuan Dynasty, during the Zhizheng period, the Meteorological Observatory was built here. In the Ming Dynasty, it was renamed the Qintian Observatory. In the early Qing Dynasty, it was moved to Beijing. The platform was destroyed by tides. Now, it has been restored to its former glory. Its origins are profound, and no modern observatory in the world can compare. To the right is Dr. Zhu Coching, the director of the Institute of Meteorology of the Academia Sinica.</p>
<p>We previously knew of eight planets, but now there is the discovery of a ninth planet. This new planet was located in Cancer on January 1st, and on January 21st of this year, it was near Gemini. It revolves around the sun like Uranus, Neptune, and Wang Man, forming a circle. This is the result of Dr. Tombaugh's mathematical research over sixteen years and represents a major advance in astronomy.</p>
<p>The Far East Meteorological Directors Conference was recently held in Hong Kong.
