<h3 id="c1">議會政治 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>今日世界之議會政治。所以漸成總崩潰之勢者。固由於法西斯主義之盛行。雄才有爲之當局。皆喜專斷獨裁之便利而無牽制。然亦由於議會自身之苛求太甚。黨派之間。又自相搗亂。引起國人之厭惡。乃成此江河日下之形勢。近來解散議會廢棄憲法之事。時有所見。在從前爲駭人聽聞。而今則國人對之。咸漠然無動於中。視爲無足重輕之舉。此何以故。以議會政治之信仰已等於零也。然而各國議會中之議員。至今仍不稍覺悟。競爭不稍休息。如德國之國會爭潮。前數日已略見和緩。今則國民黨又起而反對社會黨之贊助政府。於是白魯寗内閣。又有動摇説矣。英國自工黨大會票决信任政府後。政局漸見穩定。今則保守黨。突向政府抨擊。兩方又起一塲舌戰矣。法國會與政府間之爭。已稍沉寂。而今則國會常會開始。急進黨之先鋒。又起而猛攻政府致與政府黨迭起示威。議塲又騒然不靜矣。夫議會之爭。固不能免。然如今日之競爭不已政府黨絶不反省自已之過失。反對黨絶不原諒政府之苦衷。國人徒見議會之搗亂而一事無成。信仰之心。安得而不減。此實議會政治崩潰之大原因也。又如選舉時種種違法運動或以武力。或以金錢。或用譎詐手段。皆足使國人厭惡。美議會今日之選舉競爭。雖曰尙無暴動。然仍不能免於殺人傷人之事。亦爲减少國人信仰之一端。</p>

<p>東吳大學體育刋主任許民暉昨日來函述及滬江中止江大網球實事、茲錄原函於下、</p>
<p>申報敎育消息體育欄主筆先生閲貴報十一月二日載滬江比賽中止之聲明一節、　滬江大學體育指導倪君孝同致貴報函、其中理由違背章則、遠離事實以已之意測、作爲會章、自已未能在場、即日當時情形如是、實不免自欺欺人、故不能不加以更詳細解釋、卑免體育界同情者有所誤會、故特分條辯釋於左、</p>
<p>㈠原信内云「按華東四大學體育會憲章、凡舉行球類比賽而逢天雨時、若雙方同意、方得延期、若有一方未予以同意、則比實仍須進行、」而鄙人忝居該會會長一年、而現時又爲該會書記、對於該會憲章、自始至終、無不熟讀、然從未見有所謂「凡舉行球類比賽如逢天雨時、若雙方同意、方得延期、若有一方未與同意、則比賽仍須進行、」等語、未知倪君孝同云出自何章何節、該四大學體育會章程是從何印就、鄙人不敏、敬請倪君指示</p>
<p>㈡該函其中又云、「待第一局終了後、裁判員即與金陵體育指導及隊員逕行妥洽、停止比賽、嗣後裁判員及金陵球員即離球場地點、」未知倪君之所云、是得自幻想、或據一二學生之辭、而逕大書特書曰、「裁判員及金陵體育指導及隊員逕行妥洽、停止比賽、自後裁判員及金陵隊員即行離場他去、殊不知當開始比賽時、遍覓滬江體育指導倪君而不見其人、即其幹事隊長及各隊員等亦莫知其何所之、不得已由其幹事代行職務、委派記分員及巡邊員等各事、然後開始比賽、及第一局告終時、傾盆大雨、裁判員先問滬江指導徐紹武君雙方立於大樹下、討論應否繼續比賽、時滬江代表贊成續賽、而金陵代表則以大雨泥濘、雙方隊員已衣服盡濕、且時有滑倒地上、故爲雙方學生身體計不贊成續賽、並請延期至十一月一日（星期六）早再行續賽、時評判員見雙方相持不下、乃請會長召集臨時特别大會解决之、會長徐紹武又遍覧滬江體育指導、仍無法知其所在、又追不得已以該校幹事、余庭植君代表出席、及討論良久、之江代表諸培恩君舉出去年排球比賽、在滬江舉行時亦邁遭天雨、金陵要求停賽、東吳反對、遂由大會會議、通過改期、翌早然後繼續舉行、是有例可援、故提議不必再加討論、應照去年辦法延期比賽、倘翌日仍爲天雨、則假景海文學健身房舉行、至此衆無異議、遂通過、此時倪君孝同始斯斯而來、大會乃將决議案告之倪君乃云洵其隊員及返、則日如大會如此决定舉行、則滬江唯有棄權云云、且開會時有新聞報體育記者裴君蘇州及某報記者始終在場旁聽、故倪君在云各節、是從何而來則莫明其妙也、（未完）</p>

<p>二年前記者爲時事新報學燈撰一稿、題目「上海敎育」、曾述及租界敎育權之應收回、刻不容緩、不意目的未逹、而對方突以設立敎育部聞矣、查敎育部係吾國敎育行政最高機關、工部局此舉、不特擾亂吾國敎育系統、抑且侮辱吾國體、是可忍孰不可忍、記者乃費一週間時日、調查上海公共租界工部局、對於敎育之設施及其敎育部之出現、謹將搜獲材料、草斯篇以告國人、</p>
<h3 id="c112">敎育權之喪失與租界敎育概况 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>敎育權本係國權、因施敎育者欲以圑體之福利爲前提、受敎育者亦因以加入圑體而不能不學習圑體之習尙、遵從圑體之規律、人民以生活習慣與環境各方面之種種結合、經過悠久之歷史、形成國家、國家爲謀國基这鞏固、文化之發展、對國民敎育抱一定之目標與政策、凡國家統制之人民、均不可不受其支配而遵照其方針進行、是種敎育之權、爲國家所特有、故謂之國權、有國權、吾人有釐訂敎育宗旨權、敎育政策權、敎育監察權敎育處决權等等、</p>
<p>吾國敎育權已喪失多年、緣喪權之由來、一因敎會學校遍佈各地、二因殖民學校林立、各租界與東三省、其最著者其第一因由於唐貞觀九年、基督敎輸入中原爲禍水、旋中國一敗於英、再敗於英法聯盟、南京條約天津條約次第成立、基督敎勢燄不可炙手、光緖三十二年、學部頒佈外人設學毋庸立案、禍源遂種、貽害無窮、其第二原因、一爲租界、一爲日俄戰後、日得旅順、南滿鐵道聯接北寗路、直逹該地、日人乃由旅順展至南滿鐵路線、並延及奉天省城收受華人子弟代爲敎育、其目的在養成順民奴僕、作日人驅使、吾人於此當認識者、前一種敎育權爲國人自已放棄初無條約規定後、一種敎育權之喪失、以不平等條約爲主因、</p>
<p>上海公共租界敎育權包含上述二種、工部局設立之華童公學·育才公學·格致公學·聶中丞公學爲殖民學校、聖芳濟·聖瑪利·麥倫·等等屬敎會學校、敎會學校以傳敎侵略爲主要目的、殖民學校以養育順民爲主要目的、二者僉非中國的敎育、有碍吾國敎育權、足以破壞吾國文化則一、工部局近設華人敎育處管理新設西區、東區等華人子弟小學此不過裝飾門面耳、</p>
<p>界内四所公學辦理不良、學校行政以人轉移、一切設施不含國情、敎科偏重英語、無科學可言訓育勵行體罰、祗責服從、輕視個性、學生出路、多作外人奔走之、用鮮聞該公學畢業生在中國社會占重要位置者、記者幼弟曾肄業山海關路育才公學、凡三年、嗣後以五四運動受當局干涉罷學出校、育才從此不收十六歲以上學生、學費增至四十餘元、司馬昭之心、路人皆見矣、他如校數過少、經費僅占全市收入百出之一零七等問題、以限篇幅、恕不贅</p>

<p>自閻馮逞兵。中央下令討伐以來。相持於津浦隴海平漢三路間者。幾五六月。卒以新鄭一戰。閻馮瓦解。雖曰順逆之勢不同。而中央將土奮勇直前之氣概。實足以寒敵膽而使其不敢戀戰也。茲將閻馮末日之大激戰。追紀於左。諒爲留以此次戰事者所樂聞歟。</p>
<p>激戰前之形勢　當九月下旬時。中央軍以奮鬥之結果。突破數月來相持之局。面。在隴海線擊破内黃及睢縣以西之敵。平漢線擊破臨頴許昌之敵。閻馮際此慘敗之餘。乃以隴海線主力。集結於開封陳留附近。平漢線主力。集結於長葛新鄭附近。縮短戰線。連絡兩路。用以𨓜待勞之形勢。作最後　扎之希望。</p>
<p>六師兼程猛進　時中央軍編成十餘縱隊。乘勝長驅。直取鄭洛。以截斷敵軍歸路。第六師遂於擊潰睢縣附近之大部敵軍後。跟蹤追擊。直薄𣏌城。旋即編入第九縱隊。與第九師。第五十三師。轉向平漢路進。經通許·扶溝·尉氏·鄢陵·數縣。晝夜兼程。輕裝疾走。凡七日夜。而集結於長葛洧川之間。是處敵人節節佈防。堡壘殊形堅固。第九縱隊旣奉命向鄭州挺進。乃分三路冒險闖入。沿途逢敵圍繳。不使洩漏風聲。卒於十月一日。襲據新鄭與鄭州間之薛集薛店兩車站。當卸除鐵道電線。斷絶交通。而第六師乃分十八旅陳時驥之一部協同友軍對北警戒。以十八旅之主力與十七旅之全部。轉向南下猛攻敵背。樊崧甫於十月三日迫近新鄭城下。</p>
<p>馮軍四面受圍　十月二日後。中央軍淬厲精神。合力猛攻。敵如張維壐。趙鳳林。倪玉聲。田金凱。王和民。馮治安。鄧寳珊。任應歧等部。不下十餘萬人。均被中央軍分别包圍。以致首尾不能相顧。一一成爲甕中之龞。經三晝夜之激戰。敵人死傷無算。於是張維壐派使請求停戰。并願通電歷數馮玉祥之罪。乞中央爲之改編。第六師長趙觀濤。以時不可失。敵不可縱。亟請於蔣總司令。澈底解决。免生後患。是時顧指揮統率圍攻各師。亦洞燭其奸。回使者曰。「先繳槍後開口」。使者不得要領而去。張維壐以無計可施。乃召集軍事會議。正在相對欷歔。一籌莫展之際。而中央空軍飛機之大號炸彈。相繼擲下。一時與會人員。皆抱頭鼠竄而遁。是役中央軍除第九縱隊外。爲第十一·第六十·第六十一·第二·第三·第二十三等師</p>
<p>馮軍全部瓦解　新鄭附近之敵。旣爲中央軍分别包圍。而第六師十八旅陳時驥部所包圍者。爲倪玉聲部步兵一旅。張維壐部砲兵一圑。後因糧盡援絶。願以無條件投誠。計步槍三千餘支。砲三十餘門。騾馬四百餘匹。官兵四千餘名。悉爲第六師所收繳。敵軍於焉大震。遂引起十月六日之全部瓦解。張維壐以下高級軍官二十餘員。盡作俘虜。後奉蔣總司令電令。保全彼等生命。並酌量任用。予以自新。中下級官送入學校訓練。士兵遣回原籍。河洛乃告肅淸。</p>

<p>鐵部二週紀念游藝舉行於十一月一日。有足紀者二事。未見各報。</p>
<p>一、爲最後之幻術。一人隻身登塲。持空毯一幅。瞬即幻出大批已裱就之慶祝聯對至六七付之多。寫作俱佳。惜文長未能記憶。未復幻出丈餘錦幛一幅。上綴「完成十萬里」五大金字。上下欵俱全。爲全體職員恭祝本部者。惟此節不曾預佈。致來賓未盡候觀。爲可惜。而指導人宣稱術者爲「汪洋大海」旣非姓名亦不類于别號。頗覺費人尋思。</p>
<p>二、爲旖旎之舞蹈交誼室之裝修。光艶奪目。紅男綠女。以華裝互擁。舞蹈其問侑以音樂之悠揚。悅耳移情。洵有足令人魂銷者。其他如新劇以飾揚叟。張妻。及縣長。并吊死鬼者爲最妙。而舊劇七齣皆有可取。尤以天覇拜山爲獨到云。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　四廂彈淚惆悵紅情　一座傾心低徊綠意</p>
<p>在那樣驟然死去的肺病患者。有兩重關。以二十歲爲一重關。以三十歲爲一重關。二十歲一重關爲最危險。得肺病的靑年。往往在十六七歲。十八九歲。肺葉最嫩。侵蝕最易。二十歲的時候。無論男女。都是父母期望正殷。自已也有許多好靑年。自已正想勤奮學業。漸到了成人期。忽然的夭折了。這是一個最痛苦悼惜的事。然而在發育時期得了肺病的。往往難逃此關。這一關過了。就是要逃過三十歲的第二重關。這可以算得次危險。在那個時期裏。又閙着性慾問題。往往促進此病。使之加重。倘能逃過此關。危險便去了一大半。所以往往有許多人。在三十幾歲的當兒。看他無論如何。終活不到四十歲的了。但到四十餘歲。還是那門一個癆鬼。到五十餘歲。還是一個常常多病的老人。這好像一條挑東西的扁擔。年齡的重量加上去。只見扁擔的發彎。一時倒也不會折斷。不幸柳星叔就難逃過三十歲的第二重關。癆病到了一病不起的時候。江浙間人。稱之爲「癆病上牀」。不上牀偶然發發。到了無病時。也還游行自若。上了牀。就算完了。最苦惱的是人已無法救濟的了。醫生是已經摇頭回絶的了。家人們也不希望他有更生之望了。大家都知道他要的了。就只瞞過了病人自已。給伊説一種寛慰的話兒。這比了宣告死刑。還要難過。須知宣告死刑的囚人。在没有執行的當兒。他還有特赦的希望。還有把罪案平反的希冀。這個病體上的宣告死刑。到那裏去尋大自然的主宰。向它哀求寛免。乞它稍緩須臾呢。可是這待死的光陰。敎人如何忍受。所謂癆病上牀。就是待死光阾中。左詩晨在柳星叔的病中。也曾去看望了他幾回。第一回是备吐得最厲害。説話也没有氣力了。左詩晨不敢和他多説話。不到幾分鐘就走了。第二回聽説危險時代過去了。他極希望有個朋友去談談。那時去看他。瘦得那個身體裏在錦被裏。平塌塌地好像那個身體。伸出手來。像鳥脚爪一般。見了左詩晨。作一種慘哭道。老友。危險兒不能和你再見面了左詩晨也惟有寛慰他一番。説以後可以漸潘好起來了。他也自以爲危險時期已過了。大概病人也往往自已寛慰自已。其實已病入膏盲了。</p>

<p>閘北昨日襄路到埠米船、寥寥無幾、統祗十號之譜、新粳因走銷暢旺、價格續昻兩三角、頂貨已逹十五元關外、普通悉在十四元半左右、中關等粳須提漲三四角、交易甚殷、薄稻亦至十五元、買氣大盛、羊秈陡漲半元、客胃頗佳、高逹十二元七角、杜尖到稀消爽、上漲四角許、高開十三元二角、埠尖與客尖因零消平淡、店胃稍進、微緊一兩角而已、變元銷場極活、吊飯兩胃殊貪、價好三四角、特高開十六元關口、陰元存到兩枯、市亦隨漲、高做十五元三角、全日各檔漲風大烈、斯乃大都受産訉報昻之影響所致也、</p>
<p>滬南昨日河下到船仍祗十號左右、本街去化轉爽、常帮新粳由定趨漲、高貨照市評升、須逹十四元四五角、緣蘇同等粳因市氣活動、貨客扳售、致昻三角是以高貨批升益足矣、南路靑頂松江泗涇窰種各薄稻白稻亦受北市之漲風而喊高大盤須好兩角、開外頂開十四元六角、羊秈見緊兩角、頂貨在十二元關口、杜秈亦漲角半、特頂十二元半、此間秈米漲勢較滬北爲平、白元市况沉寂、交易無幾、</p>
<h3 id="c212">粉市廠抛軟化 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、因洋來祗小二角左右、因多空雙方、以内部之爭競甚烈、業内外未免均事觀望、所以交易甚淡、有時曾一堂微俏、迨至下午開盤、初尙平穩、繼以福新及中小廠家、近遠各期、接續狂出、致全部人心均爲震動、各月份又若疾風掃葉、一瀉直下、此種抛售、各廠或以前途實銷無望、故傾其所有、一意做空、照一般人之預測、以一錢半、已在目前、無度問題、如果廠抛仍湧、則跌到一錢、亦未爲奇也、結果本月份較前日跌二分、十二月份跌三分二釐半、一月份跌三分、二月份跌二分七釐半、三月份跌三分半、四月份跌三分二釐半云、</p>
<h3 id="c213">來市始疲終健 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、呈初疲繼堅之象、初以洋麥仍小二三角、致人心仍平、旋以大户空頭、抵補甚亟、故雖粉市銳落、及洋麥之復小、市氣反見俏利、但環境旣未改變、粉市復大跌不已、恐前途仍非轉跌不可也、結果本月份較前日反好三分、十二月份大一分、一月份未動、二三月份大一分、四月份大四分、現麥市况、全市交易仍寂、大廠仍互擯不辦、祗開瑶灣麥五百包、四兩三錢、由申大辦去云、</p>
<h3 id="c214">客秈有本街購買 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、除福建帮繼續裝辦外、本街亦起購買、而來源仍少、存底不多、因此市形立見緊張、江西機早高米又開至十一元、中次各檔亦均上展、較之前日市價、漲起三角至二角不等、如本街今後繼續購買、則福州厦門兩帮不能如往日之撳價、市面始可逐次轉機矣、統市成交江西機早二千包、價十一元、十一元零七八角、次至十元零三角、又中關機晚二百五十包價十一元五角九分、南京機米二小車、價九元四角半至九元二角、亦比前市見漲云、</p>
<h3 id="c215">南北貨　蜜棗出品减少 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>市價日緊</p>
<p>蜜棗邇來到存均稀、市價日緊、蓋今庚出貨比去年爲少、而地頭業此者皆謹愼從事緣去年大都虧耗、今年收歇者逾半、是以現在運申之貨、非俟銷去十之六七、不敢再裝、深恐再蹈覆轍也、有此原因、故貨底日見其少、而市價得以堅挺趨高、近日廣帮去胃較佳、其次本街亦當可觀、如頂上徽工超蛋售至三十一二兩、徽工秃秃二十八兩、蘭谿秃秃二十四兩、上下檔照例加退、</p>
<h3 id="c216">新菉筍頭盤已開 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>新菉筍據閩訉出貨頗湧、第因該處匪擾、以致地方不靖、到貨因以延遲、邇來到貨轉盛、各地銷場、大都均係聽價裝出、惟因國歷年關已近、故各行定價已見開出、微聞行方以價格嫌高、産地存貨頗厚、故進意殊淡、而客方尙思扳高、以致日來到貨不多、比較春盤已漲二三兩不等、至各花色價格請參閲價目表、</p>
<h3 id="c217">四川榨菜市價轉鬆 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>四川榨菜近日無到貨、查市上存底客貨、約有三千　之譜、陸續稍有開出、上莊價爲三十五元、次之差一二元不等、比前爲鬆、銷路方面、如北路内地本街等雖有採辦、數均不暢、昨市行盤、上莊售三十四元、普通售三十一二元市象平平</p>
<h3 id="c218">糖市抛貨粗砂白價宜要稀 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>現貨日糖市可轉落</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訉、古巴現糖及紐約期糖均無到市、爪哇現糖價八·三七五、期糖十一月及十二月份價均八·一二五比較前電仍無升降、公會市場劃盤荷糖二十號、粗砂白買氣沉寂、出户頗湧、成交價爲七兩八錢半、新到未能出貨者七兩八錢、進出甚懈、磨細砂白七兩九錢、二十號中砂白六兩九錢、問津亦寥、八號荷赤六兩三錢半、市較堅挺、日糖交易亦殊凋零、市且挫落Ｎ嘜七兩七錢半、Ｊ嘜八兩○七分半、ＹＲＯ嘜七兩三錢二分半、ＹＴ嘜七兩六錢半、ＹＲ嘜七兩九錢二分半、比之前日挫跌二分半至五分、市象仍具衰頺之跡、太古車糖Ｒ嘜正二月份交貨抖售六兩五錢、新規加税劃劃價八兩、受手毫無、抛貨荷糖粗砂白市亦轉宜、抖價荷幣五元九角半、行方進意淡薄、故一時亦在交也、</p>

<p>連日爲秋賽期中五金交易、因洋行方面祗半日交易、故買賣異常淸靜、各貨標準因進出均鮮、故無上落惟聞新鐵類中、如新洋元洋板三角鐵等則因海外定價趨疲、故有放鬆之象云、</p>
<h3 id="c220">本釘出口甚踴躍 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>本釘出口近甚踴躍、如天津漢口一帶連日均有大批出口、而福建汕頭諸帮近來亦多來談判、故昨日墏出口之數共有千餘桶之多、但行情一節、殊無上落云、</p>
<h3 id="c221">會司鐵提漲二錢半 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>會司鐵邇來交易、大有雨後春草之勢、如製罐廠烟草公司猪油作笋廠等均有點綴、故前昨二日、共售出有二千餘箱之多、惟市貨自經收辦之後、大告寥落、因此行情節節升漲、如昨日又漲起二錢半、計老鋼廠估二十二兩五錢、新鋼廠二十一兩五錢、三井貨十九兩五錢、聞連日出口帮亦在收辦、是以市象前途、大有續好氣象、而後批到貨、恐年内無貨可到、因是人心益堅、標準愈挺、據最近毎日銷場有千餘扎之多、則年内趨勢、恐不免有斷檔之憂、故金融富裕者、莫不乘時吸收、以防來時不測故新近交易、益覺熱鬧也、</p>

<p>川漢絲頭自入秋以來、歐銷久趨不振、滬存日厚、價益趨疲邇來海外冬季絲織品已上市、各絲織廠預備開織春　、需要漸起、本埠各法莊日來分接巴黎·馬賽·里昻等處、來電探詢、川漢絲頭市面、因在秋賽期中、今日當邀各華商進行談判、惟聞西安挽手及四川巾子等海外來價、仍趨疲勢云、</p>

<p>昨日星期三、爲秋賽第三日、各洋行仍祗上午辦公、海外絲電轉滬寥落、絲廠全體停業、廠商益抱消極、市氣停滯、昨祗三星進白乾　八包、祥記進棉州白絲十包、價均堅定云、</p>

<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、依然淸淡、蓋在此秋賽期中、洋行家祗有半日市面、而俄莊協助會、始終抱定非廉不購態度、且挑剔甚嚴、是以昨市珍眉貢熙綠茶、及祁門紅茶、均無大宗交易云、</p>

<p>本廠布市面逐步轉軟尤以細布細斜更呈一蹶不振之勢、考其原因、實以上春以來逐步向上從未回落、至上月初開價均已高至極點、故實銷一靜、人心即異常虚弱細布首先下落、日來細斜亦步跌不已、昨阳鹤又跌、售六兩九錢二分半、藍雙魚六兩七錢半、粗布漲風亦息、湖北天字已陸續到滬、十三磅雙鷹現貨亦見增多、惟粗斜依然堅挺、實以出貨不多之故耳、</p>
<p>東西疋日來東貨步跌不已、昨以中花絨已稍轉機一錢九分之貨不多見、黑花絨盡須一錢九分二里半、印花絨跌風未已、多數已跌至一錢九分、中山呢一度斷檔後、昨已運到、蕉葉題書二錢八分、銀炮車三錢九分、本街有添辦、廻絞嗶嘰·細嗶嘰已漸有到滬、故趨勢亦不若先前堅挺、下身直貢呢亦到四五十件、靜安寺麻姑戲壽均開二錢九分、彩條絨自小東門各號一度搜辦後、昨已見漲、多數開六兩五錢之外云、</p>

<p>— 物</p>
<p>復旦社會學系自應成一先生接辦以來、系内精神極佳、蓋因歸師生各作、系友聯絡所致、新近該系又出版一册半月刋、内容方面極有精彩、售價亦甚低廉、毎月逢五逢二十出版、撰稿由師生雙方合作、</p>
<p>第一期出版之後、我已略略拜讀過、覺得他們有二種不可磨滅的精神、就是學理與實用雙方並重、所以在此欄内不仿作一個簡短的介紹、我想愛讀社會科學諸君亦所棄聞的、</p>
<p>論著共有三篇、第一篇是系主任應成一先生的「何謂眞理」、第二篇是系友王在勤君的「動的社會觀」、第三篇是系友陳培森的「同盟罷工研究、」按次述其大概於下、</p>
<p>「何謂眞理」一篇、分爲四方面討論、第一是「眞理的基起點、」第二、是「眞理的方面、」第三是「眞理之複雜性、」第四是「眞理之究竟、」著者先確定物我二個原素、因爲人類的行動都是基於這二個原素的相互作用也、就是眞理産生的起點、講到「基本起點」的第一段、有云、「我者物之所定奪者也、故舉我之時、物之意義已包含其中、不過我爲其表現之方面、而物爲其含蓄之方面耳、物者又我之所定奪者也、故舉物之時、我之意義已包含其中、不過物爲其表現之一方面、我爲其含蓄之一方面耳、……」並舉唐詩以爲例、第二段大略謂「凡人有對我之覺性時則失去對物之覺性、有對於物之覺性時、則失對於准之覺性、第三段是説人類在複雜環境之中、不受我之統轄、即受物之統轄、不受物之統轄、即受我之統轄、這二種原則互相調劑、就産生一種關係、從這種關係上可以認識我、從這關係上可以認識物、此種關係又有二種方法、即自然的關係與人爲的關係、並且又説明了我·物·物我關係之互相爲條件、第二方面是「眞理之方面分爲三段討論、即「我之眞理、」以我爲標準測量一切之物「物之眞理」即以物爲標準測量許多之我、其中並舉不少美滿的例證、從略、第三段是我物關係之眞理、」原文云、「關係超於我、有關係之覺性、不徇於物、亦不執於已、以物我爲一傳……」並舉夫妻之關係爲例、第三方面是「眞理的複雜性」以爲物·我·物我之關係是眞理之三方面、不是絶對的眞理、包抱這三方面而綜合成一體、這種綜合的性質、又可以假定三種名詞以作代表、即第一原因第二原因第三原因是也著者云、「第三原因、我物之關也、物之不可見者、第一原因也、而物之可見者、第二原因也、……」並舉歐洲大戰以爲例、政治情形、心理情形、是皆不可見者、乃是第一原因、奥塞間發生衝突、是事之可見者、乃是第二原因、所以第一原因是是必然的第二原因是或然的、第三原因又名最後原因因、爲「物生於我·我者最後原因也、我生於物·物者最後之原因也」承認這三種原因、是循環往復、周流不絶、這就是眞理的全部、也孰是宗敎之眞理、科學之眞理、哲學之眞理所由起、著者云「……合三種眞理而同觀之、所言者實即一個眞理、分三種眞理而各觀之、乃是三種眞理眞理、之不能一言而定、非人學力之所不能、乃人技藝之有限制也、眞理爲動性、而言語乃靜體、思想乃靜體、則無怪於宗敎家科學家之紛紛各執一是矣、」第四方面講的是「眞理的究竟、」總結全篇謂眞理超於一切、惟其超於一切、故一切皆非眞理、因爲眞理是動性的、决不能以言語思想符號來表示、</p>
<p>第二篇是「動的社會觀、」共分七大段、㈠引論述説三個觀察社會的方法、就是以宇宙觀察社會、以個人觀察社會、以社會觀察社會及其批評、㈡以科學來觀宇宙的動靜、以天體的組織證明宇宙在動、㈢以科學來觀察物質的動靜、以物質組織的原子電子證明表面靜的物質也是動的、㈣從動的宇宙去觀察所結合的社會、從宇宙全部動作而證明社會局部的動、㈤社會現象變化的法則、承認社會的動是按照赫格爾的「辨證法」而進行的、㈥是社會進程中的革命論、在社會動的進程中要發生一種突變、這種突變普通呌做革命、完全是一種自然的趨勢不能阻止、也不能造作、</p>
<p>第三篇是「同盟罷工研究」、因本篇尙未刋完、俟刋完後再行介紹、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Parliamentary Politics <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The parliamentary politics of today's world are gradually heading towards total collapse. This is certainly due to the prevalence of Fascism, where talented and ambitious authorities prefer the convenience of arbitrary autocracy without checks and balances. However, it is also due to the parliaments themselves making excessive demands, and factions within them undermining each other, causing public disgust. This has led to the current state of affairs, where things are going downhill. Recently, the dissolution of parliaments and the abandonment of constitutions have become common occurrences. In the past, these would have been shocking and unheard of, but now the people of various countries are indifferent and unmoved by them, regarding them as insignificant actions. Why is this? Because faith in parliamentary politics has dwindled to nothing. However, the members of parliaments in various countries still do not show any awareness and continue to compete endlessly. For example, the struggle within the German Reichstag had shown slight signs of easing a few days ago, but now the Nationalist Party has risen again to oppose the Social Democrats' support for the government. As a result, there are rumors of instability in the Brüning cabinet. In Britain, since the Labor Party Congress voted to trust the government, the political situation had gradually stabilized. However, now the Conservative Party has suddenly attacked the government, and the two sides have started another verbal battle. The dispute between the French parliament and the government had subsided somewhat, but now, with the start of the regular session of parliament, the vanguard of the Radical Party has risen again to fiercely attack the government, resulting in repeated demonstrations by the government party. The parliamentary arena is once again noisy and unsettled. Disputes within parliament are unavoidable, but the endless competition of today, where the government party never reflects on its own mistakes and the opposition party never understands the government's difficulties, only leads the people to see the chaos of parliament and the failure to achieve anything. How can faith in it not diminish? This is truly the main reason for the collapse of parliamentary politics. Furthermore, various illegal activities during elections, such as using force, money, or deceptive tactics, are all enough to disgust the people. Although the electoral competition in the American Congress today may not involve outright riots, it still cannot avoid incidents of killing and injuring people, which is also a factor in reducing public faith.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Water Line Conference Continues <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>

<p>Still Commands His Subordinates to Actively Resist Japan</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Puli, 4th Day: Hanaoka Ichiro, the mastermind of the aboriginal rebellion, is still commanding the Mahebo aboriginal tribe to continue resisting. The previous report of Hanaoka's suicide was a false report by an aboriginal youth.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Wushe, 5th Day: Masheho, which in aboriginal language means ancestor, the aborigines are resisting the Japanese punitive force with close combat. Although they are on the verge of total destruction, they still hold on. They are currently holding on to Taruwan and Masheho valleys. The aborigines have lost most of their will to fight due to the Japanese punitive force's bomb and mountain artillery attacks. Their only reliable machine guns have also been seized by the Japanese army. Their food can only last for 20 days, so surrender is expected soon.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Puli, 5th Day: According to the wife of Yamada, the police officer stationed in Wushe who was the first to be killed, the rebellion was initiated by Hanaoka Ichiro and Jiro. When the uprising broke out, they led the aborigines to my house first and killed my husband. I hid in the toilet for three days and three nights, hearing the sound of my eldest daughter being beaten and wailing in the courtyard, but I could not help, I could only swallow my tears.</p>

<p>Roosevelt Re-elected Governor of New York</p>
<p>Hopeful for Next Presidency</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 4th Day: The general election was held in New York State today. Based on the results so far, the Democratic Party has gained an advantage. Roosevelt has been re-elected Governor of New York. This result is directly related to the 1932 presidential election, as Roosevelt will be the Democratic Party's presidential candidate at that time. Republican newspapers also acknowledge that the election in New York State favors the Democratic Party. Several southern states that supported Republican President Hoover two years ago are now leaning towards the Democratic Party. This morning, all newspapers, regardless of which party they support, stated that the main reason for the Republican Party's failure is the economic downturn, with the prohibition issue being secondary.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 4th Day: At 10:45 PM tonight, the Democratic headquarters announced that it has obtained the power to control the House of Representatives. However, according to the Associated Press's vote count, there is no trend of the Democratic Party winning. A total of 101 Democrats from the North and South have been elected. The Republican Party occupies 32 in uncontested areas, so the Democratic Party needs to win the remaining 117 votes to gain a majority.</p>
<p>Associated Press, New York, 4th Day: According to reports received today from various parts of the United States, there were no major riots on election day, and the vote count was extremely crowded. Only one incident occurred in Danville, where a black man was killed, and in Cleveland, a black man was injured. The cause of the incident was a heated debate. The results of this 72nd election will be known in detail around midnight tonight (Far East time).</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Upcoming Disarmament Preparatory Conference <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Disarmament Draft Not Easily Passed Unanimously</p>
<p>Britain, Germany, and the United States Will Strive for Success</p>
<p>::Outline of the Five Parts of the Draft::</p>
<p>Geneva News: The League of Nations Preparatory Disarmament Commission was originally scheduled to open this month, but the atmosphere here is only filled with doubt. Even those who have hope are only shrouded in apprehension. In theory, the Preparatory Disarmament Commission should not convene again after this meeting and wait for the opening of the formal disarmament conference next year. However, in reality, most League of Nations officials dare not firmly believe this, because it is not yet certain whether the outcome of this meeting can draft a disarmament agreement acceptable to all parties, so as to serve as the basis for discussion at the future formal disarmament conference. The draft disarmament agreement has been drafted by the committee for five years, but only a few points have been agreed upon by the general countries concerned, and the provisions on the reduction of land forces, especially for Britain and France, are the focus of conflicting opinions. In fact, the draft does not contain any particularly valuable provisions regarding naval disarmament, because before the opening of the London Five-Power Naval Conference, the preparatory disarmament committee believed that the London Conference would be a great success, and that it would only need to add it to the draft after the five-nation agreement was established to complete the overall plan for land and naval disarmament, so it decided not to discuss it further. However, the results of the London Conference were only an agreement between Britain, the United States, and Japan. France and Italy, as well as between Britain and France, and Britain and Italy, had no concrete decisions. In the recent naval talks between Italy and France at the League of Nations General Assembly, there was another breakdown. Therefore, the committee's disarmament draft still lacks a large part of the naval events. What is even more difficult is that several clauses in the draft have been declared by the countries concerned to reserve the right to raise objections. Countries such as Soviet Russia have loudly opposed the entire plan, believing that disarmament must be true to its name, that is, all countries must completely disarm uniformly, or at least temporarily disarm 50% of all weapons. This proposal is of course not willing to be discussed by the committee, so it has not yet been included in the agenda. However, if this meeting can pass the adoption of the committee's draft, so that the formal meeting next year can be held safely, then at least the global arms race can be temporarily suspended, and the League of Nations can hope to convene a meeting every five years thereafter, and then there is a real hope for the reduction of international armaments. As for the disarmament draft prepared by the preparatory committee, it can be roughly divided into five parts. The first part is about the reduction of actual combat equipment for the navy, army, and air force. The second part is about the reduction of other application materials for the navy, army, and air force. The third part stipulates that limiting the military expenditure budget of each country can limit actual military equipment. This method has long been supported by the Scandinavian countries. The fourth part stipulates the prohibition of all chemical warfare. This part is expected to be passed by all countries without difficulty, because the League has already had an agreement stipulating the prohibition of all poisonous gas chemicals and germ warfare, which has been ratified by many member states. The fifth part is about all kinds of miscellaneous regulations, but although the problems are relatively small, the opinions of various countries are very different, and there will inevitably be debates during the discussion. The most important of these is the management issue. Many countries have expressed that they want the disarmament agreement to be effective and must be supervised by an international organization such as the League of Nations. The opponents believe that this will damage national sovereignty and have endless drawbacks, and have tried their best to protest that there is no neutral solution. According to people from the League of Nations, it is expected that the preparatory meeting will be extended to four weeks or even six weeks, because certain countries, especially Britain and the United States, have decided to work hard to seek at least some kind of coordination, and Germany will also strive to force the countries surrounding its borders to reduce at least a part of their armaments.

<p>National News, London, 4th Day: The Labor Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, predicts that coal miners in England, Scotland, and Wales will stage a general strike on the 1st of next month due to the seven-and-a-half-hour working time issue.

<p>Conservative Amendment Rejected</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th Day: Conservative Neville Chamberlain proposed an amendment to the King's Speech yesterday, criticizing the government for failing to put forward any measures sufficient to cope with the agricultural, industrial, and commercial crisis or to prevent increased unemployment. The House of Commons continued to debate the bill today. Liberal Party leader George criticized the government's inaction in handling the unemployment issue, but said he was unwilling to support the amendment because it was protectionist in nature. He must wait for the results of cooperation between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party on the unemployment issue. The House of Commons observers believed that George's failure to support the Conservative amendment was intended to allow the government to explain its detailed methods for handling unemployment before Christmas, that is, after the end of the Imperial Conference and the Indian Round Table Conference, the government might encounter serious attacks from the two opposition parties. The House of Commons then rejected the Conservative amendment by 281 votes to 250.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th Day: Today, after debating the King's Speech, the House of Commons passed the original text of the speech. Conservative leader Baldwin stated during the debate that he was unwilling to participate in a triangular conference to discuss the unemployment issue, because the government completely rejected tariff issues. Prime Minister MacDonald spoke in reply, saying that the government is now fully considering the procedures for mutual assistance between Britain and the autonomous regions, but the government has used preferential measures for a British company to obtain orders for bulk goods, but the company cannot enjoy the benefits of this order due to restrictions of certain unemployment agreements, so the unemployment of British people is mostly due to international industrial agreements.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 4th Day: Dr. Goebbels, a member of Congress and the leader of the National Socialist Party in Berlin, declared at a meeting of the National Socialist Party today that when he was the Minister of the Interior, if the newspaper criticized him, his warriors would rush into the newspaper office and make the editors drink a cup of castor oil each. In half an hour, he would send the police to the scene. The National Socialist Party must one day break the tradition of Congress and ensure that opponents no longer appear. As for the Communist Party, several people must be severely punished to kill their arrogance. Anyone who drives a foreign car in Germany should be whipped, and their car should be destroyed. If his words are true, then after the National Socialist Party takes power, there will be no survivors for the thug party in Germany.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Recent Communist Suppression Situation of the Fourth Route Army <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The areas in Hunan currently ravaged by the Communist bandits are Nanhua in western Hunan, Pingliuchayou in southern Hunan, and Gui in southern Hunan, with Nanhua and Pingliu being the most severely affected. The recent combat situation of the various units of the Fourth Route Army in Nanhua and Pingliu is described as follows:</p>
<p>Recovering Nanhua County: About 10,000 Communist bandits of He Long and Kuang Jiqin's troops, who fled from Honghu Lake, Hubei, to Hunan, captured Nanhua and Nanhua counties on the 22nd of last month, which shocked Yuezhou. He Jian ordered Peng Weiren, commander of the 16th Division, to lead Liu Jiren's brigade, and Li Guoqiang and Hu Yang's regiments, to depart from Changsha to Yuanjiang to suppress the bandits, ordered Dai Huiheng, commander of the bandit suppression command in western Hunan, to lead his two regiments to suppress the bandits from Yuanjiang Hanshou to Nanhua, ordered Zhang Ying's division of the Sichuan Army Lai Xinhui's troops to suppress the bandits from Anxiang to Nanhua, and ordered Chen Quzhen's troops of the First Garrison Army Chen Yunyi and Dai Jitao's regiments to suppress the bandits from Jinshi to Nanhua. At the same time, they telegraphed the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters to dispatch Xu Yuanquan's division from Diaoxiankou to Lianyushu to block Nanhua. On the 18th, they began to suppress the bandits separately, and there was great progress in the past few days. On the morning of the 30th, Peng's division, Li Guoqiang's regiment, and Dai's troops' Xiang Keqian's regiment recovered Nanhua County. The two bandits, He and Kuang, fled to JinFeng and the border of Hubei. Dai Huiheng was left to suppress Nanhua County and clear out the remaining bandits. Peng Weiren tracked and suppressed the bandits in Meitian Lake and Huarong on the 1st of this month. Yesterday, the headquarters of the Guolu (Guizhou Route) received the following urgent telegrams from Peng Weiren and Dai Huiheng: (Peng Weiren's telegram) (1) Li Guoqiang's regiment of my department, in cooperation with Xiang Keqian's regiment of Commander Dai's department, contacted the He bandits at Gantan River, about eight miles south of Nanhua County, at Maoke (5-7 AM) on the 30th. My Hu Tang's regiment continued to arrive, and the bandits were unable to resist and fled in the direction of Yijiazui and Meitian Lake. They then recovered Nancheng at 7:30 AM. At 6 AM on the same day, my Nanyuanyi (Nanhua, Yuanjiang, Yiuyang) three county troops contacted about five or six hundred bandits near Fenghu, killing thousands of bandits, and the bandits fled to Huarong. Zhang Ying's division of my Sichuan Army defeated the bandits near Hehua Village at 7 AM on the same day. According to reports, the bandits were the two sixth divisions led by He Long, with about 10,000 people and about 3,000 guns. Most of them are now fleeing to the border of Hubei, Lianshu and Meitian Lake, and forcibly crossed the Sanwen River at 11 AM on the 30th, but were blocked by my Sichuan Army and failed. A part of them fled to Ouchi. A total of one hundred and forty or fifty bandits were killed in this battle. Xiang's regiment of Dai's troops seized 15 guns, more than 500 cotton windbreakers, and many spears, darts, and machetes. The seized goods were handed over to the Chamber of Commerce for collection. The officers and soldiers who fought in the Xiang regiment were all brave. I and Commander Dai arrived in Nanhua this afternoon. I, Peng Weiren, presented this report, 30th未印, (2) A part of the bandits are now fighting fiercely with my Sichuan Army in the Meitian Lake Guandang area on the Sanwen River Wapotu side. In addition to sending a part to Sanwen River yesterday afternoon to reinforce the Sichuan Army, I am approved to lead a large part in the morning to suppress Meitian Lake. Today, an iron-clad fireboat with a machine gun and more than 20 riflemen has been dispatched to patrol Meitian Lake and conduct reconnaissance. Nanhua's defenses have ordered the Nanhua Yuanyi troops to deploy guards along the line from Nanhua Chengtianjiazui to the west bank of the river and asked Commander Dai Huaiyuan to sit and preside over the town. I, Peng Weiren, presented this report, ShiWu印. (Dai Huiyuan's telegram) I received a telegram from Xiang Kequan, the head of my regiment, stating that a large part of the bandits withdrew to Huajiaohu Shanziguai Yijiazui after my regiment occupied Sanxian Lake, and only two independent regiments occupied Nanhua County and Yumaozhou. 2. I set off from Sanxian Lake by wheel at 1:00 am on the 30th and landed at Xiaobaizhou at dawn. Then, I handed over the Fan and Luo battalions to Director Yang of Nanhua County to lead them through the land of Hubei to Nanhua Northwest, and I personally led the Xi and Long battalions from Xiaobaizhou along the dike through Shengang to attack the southern city of Yuweizhou, and contacted the guard force of the bandits in Yuweizhou. After a battle of about an hour, at about 7 o'clock, I was forced to reach the vicinity of the southern city. The bandits resisted desperately, and after two hours of fierce fighting, my Fan and Luo battalions copied from the rear, and the bandits fled to Shishou Ouchi, on the border of Hubei, and my troops completely occupied Nancheng. While maintaining order, I ordered the Long battalion to pursue Huajiaohu Shanziguai. 3. My Sichuan Army is at Sanwen River Hehuazui and other places. Li Guoqiang of the Sixteenth Division arrived here. 4. I will enter Nanhua County to continue to consult with Commander Peng on the bandit suppression, and I must wipe them out. I will report this first, Dai Huiyuan Kowtows on the 30th.</p>
<p>Pingjiang Battle Situation: Pingliu has always been a den of bandits. After most of the Communist bandits Peng Huang Zhu Mao entered Jiangxi, Kong Hechong, Hu Yun, Li Shixing, and other groups remained in Pingliu. He Jian sent Chen Guangzhong's independent 7th Brigade with four regiments and the Liuyang Security Regiment, about five regiments in total, to suppress Liuyang, and sent the 31st Division Tao Guang's troops with three regiments, the 15th Division Hou Pengfei's brigade with three regiments, and the bandit suppression second battalion Zhu Xingshu's troops, about one regiment, a total of seven regiments, to suppress Pingjiang. Although the county towns of Pingliu have been recovered one after another, in Liuyang, the Communist bandits are still being cleared near the county town. As for the four rural townships and towns, they are still occupied by the Communist bandits. Because Ping is full of bandits, they hide in the mountains during the day and there are no traces of the bandits. At night, they often whistle thousands of people to attack the official army. Every time a command is sent or some grain is purchased, it requires at least a battalion of troops to escort it, otherwise it is often taken advantage of by the bandits along the way. Division Commander Guang Tao was afraid of repeating the same mistakes as Dai Douyuan in Wenjiashi, Liuyang. He planned to add more than one division of troops after Suqing in Nanhua, take a step-by-step approach, and then suppress the bandits. He Jian has replied and approved this. Yesterday, Tao Guang sent another telegram to ask for instructions: A telegram has been sent to decide to transfer to the line from Lusu Mountain to Tianyue Mountain to Chengtan. I would like to ask for your inspection. That is, at Ling Dynasty, all departments were ordered to move to the decided location for camping. At dawn this morning, the officers gathered each brigade regiment, inspected the terrain, so as to build projects. But around the circuit, thousands of valleys, transmitting orders, half a day, Ren Qu and anything were. However, I temporarily ordered Hou's brigade to withdraw to Zhushagong Putang immediately, and my unit withdrew to Longtang Guanjiaqiao, and Zhu's unit was located at Genggutai. I was available this evening, but Zhushazong's line, the terrain was complicated, and the force was not easy to display. I plan to go to Baimaotian Jieshan and other places tomorrow morning to scout out for a suitable location, so as to gather forces and facilitate attack and defense, (middle omitted) How to plan to suppress the bandits later, I beg your instructions, Tao Guangcheng Shiyin. How Jian replied, I have not yet found out. It is heard that He is due to the fact that the Communist bandits in Nanhua are rampant. How should we add troops to block and block the area? In addition, how to increase troops to suppress the Pingjiang area, has decided to convene a military meeting tomorrow to discuss the methods. (November 2nd)</p>

<p>Troops Still Number Over 40,000</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: Xiong Bin and He Qigong, representatives sent by Feng Yuxiang to the Northeast, returned from Shenyang and stayed overnight in Beiping yesterday. They left by train for Shanxi this morning. Xiong did not utter a word in Beiping, while He expressed to his friends that he had stayed in Shenyang for nearly ten days. Zhang Zuoxiang showed great appreciation for Xiong's full authority to represent Feng Huanzhang in negotiating the aftermath of military affairs. However, he regretted that they had come too late. Had Xiong been sent at the same time as Xue Dubi and Men Zhizhong, everything would have been easier to negotiate. Therefore, Xiong's ten-day stay in Shenyang yielded no results. Upon his return this time, he received a telegram from Feng in Tianjin, informing him that Feng had returned from Zezhou to Yuncheng. He immediately took the route through Pinghan, Zhengtai, and then Taiyuan by car to Yuncheng to report to Feng. However, according to news received here today from Taiyuan, Yan Xishan, due to the changed situation in Shaanxi, believes that it is impossible for Feng's troops to return to Shaanxi. He has telegraphed Feng to return to Taiyuan to discuss other solutions in person. Therefore, when Xiong and He arrive in Taiyuan, Feng may have already arrived there, making it unnecessary to go to Yuncheng to meet. It is known that Feng arrived in Jincheng (i.e., Zezhou) from Taiyuan on the 19th of this month and turned back to Yuncheng from Jincheng on the 20th. Feng's motive for going to Jincheng was due to Lu Zhonglin's resignation. When Feng's troops retreated to the north bank of the Yellow River last time, Feng only took about one-third of his men into Shanxi. The remaining two-thirds were left in Xinxiang, Jiaozuo, and other places. Feng then appointed Lu Zhonglin as the commander-in-chief, intending to command these tens of thousands of troops. Unexpectedly, Lu was unable to command them. Feng then came to Jincheng again and received 100,000 yuan in cash and four carts of supplies from Yan Xishan, hoping to distribute them to these troops. However, after arriving in Jincheng, Sun Lianzhong's army defected to the central government, which had become a reality. Feng was thus struck a blow. Zheng Dazhang's cavalry and artillery, numbering more than 2,000, went to Shandong, and Feng was struck another blow. As a result, Feng only managed to pull together Liu Ruming's army of 5,000, Zheng Dazhang's army of more than 1,000, and other troops totaling less than 10,000, and brought them back to Hedong. After returning to Yuncheng, he gathered Sun Liangcheng, Pang Bingxun, Liu Ruming, Zheng Dazhang, and others to discuss future survival strategies. Everyone agreed that although the thirteen counties of Hedong were currently allocated by Yan Xishan as garrison and food supply areas, relying on others was not a long-term solution. They unanimously advocated returning to Shaanxi, first to help Liu Yufen and Song Zheyuan block Yang Hucheng's army, and then gradually plan to recover Gansu. After the agreement was reached, they lacked funds for departure and ammunition. Pang Bingxun was sent as a representative to Taiyuan to request Yan Xishan's assistance. Yan Xishan was unwilling to have Feng's army stay in Hedong for a long time and was happy to send them out of Shanxi. He immediately agreed to allocate 200,000 rounds of rifle ammunition, 7,000 hand grenades, 1,400 bags of flour, and 150,000 yuan in cash, all of which were collected by Pang, so that Feng could immediately supervise the army to depart. Unexpectedly, while Pang was preparing to leave Taiyuan, the telegrams of Yang Hucheng's army capturing Tongguan and entering Xi'an arrived one after another. Since Xi'an had already fallen, there was nothing to be done in Shaanxi, and Feng's officers and soldiers were unwilling to go. Feng in Yuncheng was also helpless. It is said that Liu Yufen and others suffered a major setback, largely due to the influence of the anti-Feng armies and bandits in southern Shaanxi, northern Shaanxi, and Hanzhong. With Xi'an surrounded on three sides and Yang's army pressing in, they had no choice but to retreat in a hurry. As for Gansu, eight-tenths of the province has now fallen into the hands of anti-Feng armies and local armies. It is said that Feng is still maintaining a calm attitude on the surface at this time, but in reality, he has the intention of giving up from now on. However, the question of which route to take to go abroad has become a difficult problem. (After the fall of Zhangjiakou, the road to Kulun has been cut off, and there is no way to go through Siberia.) As for his troops gathered in Hedong, the actual number is still 45,000 to 6,000.

<h3 id="e71">Train Collision on the Jiaoji Railway <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: At 2:00 a.m. today (the 3rd), the 60th freight train on the Jiaoji Railway, which departed from Jidong, arrived at Longshan Station. The driver, Kuang Keren, failed to lower the brakes in time, and the train went past the station. At this time, the 555th coal train (coal train of the provincial government) coming from the east was entering the station, and it collided with the 60th freight train. Two coal cars and one guard car were derailed and badly damaged. Two brakemen were seriously injured. The locomotive of the 60th freight train, No. 552, was also damaged, and several feet of the track were also destroyed. After the Jinan Station heard the alarm, Liu Dide, the chief of the transportation section, Du Baotian, the chief of the locomotive section, and Wang Xun, the engineer, immediately led more than 50 workers and a large amount of materials to the scene by special train to repair the damage. Because the track was damaged and the train was blocking the road, traffic was blocked. Therefore, the first passenger train coming from Qingdao in the west this morning was stopped at Puji, and the sixth passenger train coming from Jidong at 8:30 a.m. was stopped at Guodian. They could not pass until the track was repaired. Because each train was busy suppressing bandits in Jiaodong, the Taishan armored train was ordered to go to Jiaozhou today, and the Shandong armored train was ordered to go to Weixian, but they could not go due to the damaged track. It is known that the crashed No. 552 locomotive is the largest locomotive on the Jiaoji Railway, worth 200,000 yuan. The railway suffered heavy losses this time.</p>
<p>According to another dispatch from Jinan Station, the cause of the accident was that the 555th coal train had already entered the station when the 60th freight train collided with it on the east end of the station because it failed to brake. The front half of the 555th train was not damaged, but two coal cars and one guard car in the rear half were hit into the coal cars by the 60th No. 552 locomotive, causing them to derail and destroying eleven rails. After the railway workers stepped up repairs, it was difficult to drag the locomotive out of the coal cars. It was not until about 11:00 a.m. that two tracks were repaired. One coal car was still lying across the two tracks, so only one train could pass at a time, not cross. The first train did not arrive in Jinan until 4:00 p.m., a total delay of eight hours and forty-five minutes. The railway bureau is investigating the responsibility for the accident. Zhai Xingyuan, the captain of the 60th freight train, and Kuang Keren, the driver, were ordered to continue their service as usual, pending clarification of the investigation before a decision is made on their punishment. As for the two injured brakemen, the injuries are not fatal and there is no danger to their lives. (November 3)</p>

<p>Xue Chuanfeng's Band Flees to Hebei</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Rui Xiebang of the Propaganda Section of the General Staff Office of the First Army Group received a telegram yesterday from Rong Guangxing, the brigade commander of the 87th Brigade, from Puyang, reporting that the bandit Xue Chuanfeng's attempt to attack Puyang failed and he is now leading the remnants of 300 to 400 bandits to flee into Hebei Province. The banditry in western Shandong can be said to be gradually suppressed. He himself has led the History Corps to station in Puyang and will return to Yanggu within a few days. The original telegram is as follows: "To Brother Rui Xiebang, Section Chief of the General Staff Office of the First Army Group, Honorable Sir, Your humble servant led his troops to suppress the bandit Xue. We entered Guanxian on the 29th. The bandit had already looted the border and fled towards Puyang. Then, we received an urgent letter from Wang, the magistrate of Puyang, saying that the bandit Xue had the potential to attack Puyang. Your humble servant immediately led the History Corps to set off and reinforce Puyang. The army marched to Cangshang, but it was too late to pursue further. The next morning, we continued our advance and arrived at Puyang. According to Magistrate Wang, the bandit did not dare to enter the city due to the pressure from our army. He only led the remnants of 300 to 400 bandits and fled in desperation from Guyunji in the north of the county to Liuxiatun in Jizhou. This bandit, who was known as 8,000 and plagued western Shandong for nearly two years, has been collapsing along the way since our brigade besieged him in Yanggu and Shouzhang. Some were killed, and some were resolved by the militia. Now, there are only a few hundred left, who have fled our Shandong province to Jizhou province. The banditry in western Shandong can be said to be gradually suppressed. In addition to ordering the History Corps to station in the county, your humble servant will return to Yanggu within a few days to handle the affairs of clearing the countryside, in order to thoroughly eliminate the banditry and eliminate future troubles. I hereby report this to you. Rong Guangxing salutes." (3rd)</p>

<h3 id="e74">Problem of Prohibiting the Planting of Opium Seedlings in Southern Fujian <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Zhen Requests the Anti-Opium Association to Send Personnel for Inspection</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Since the provincial government issued a strict prohibition on poisonous flowers in southern Fujian in the 17th year of the Republic, they have not been planted last year. This year, villagers in Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xinghua counties suddenly spread rumors that the authorities were going to lift the opium ban. As a result, they purchased large quantities of poppy seeds and prepared to plant them. The Provincial Anti-Opium Association heard that some troops were providing protection. It reported to the provincial government, requesting that each army be responsible for prohibiting planting and not providing protection. On the 17th, Yang Shuzhuang sent a telegram to the leaders of the troops stationed in the province, strictly reiterating the ban. On the same day, Commander-in-Chief Jiang, based on the presentation of the National Anti-Drug Association, also telegraphed the troops stationed in Fujian, ordering them to be responsible for jointly banning planting with the county magistrates. If opium seedlings are found, they will be punished in the same way as local officials. However, according to investigations, seeds have been sown in Quanzhou, Jinjiang, Maping, Qingyang, and Anhai. In Nan'an and Tong'an counties, many seeds have also been sown. In Putian and Xianyou, planting is underway. In Zhangzhou, preparations are also being made for planting. After Chairman Yang telegraphed the reiteration of the ban, Chen Jiliang, the commander of the Marine Corps, immediately announced that his troops were strictly prohibited from providing protection. Zhang Zhen, the commander of the newly formed First Division, also telegraphed the provincial government, requesting that each unit send representatives to form a propaganda team to go to the defense areas for propaganda and supervision. On the 25th, he telegraphed the provincial government again, saying, "I previously received your telegram indicating the anti-opium measures. I replied by telegram and invited you to inspect. I, Zhen, am pained by the opium disaster. I have long heard of this decree. In the spring of the 17th year, I attended the provincial government meeting and strongly advocated the eradication of opium. My efforts were lonely, and it was even before the central government promulgated the anti-opium law. At that time, when the troops entered Fujian, it was the time when opium seedlings were harvested. Those who collected donations requested through intermediaries to pay hundreds of thousands of donations to delay the eradication. I immediately refused and eradicated them. The past is there to prove it. Now that the overall situation is calm, order is becoming more and more stable. Suppressing the Communists, clearing bandits, prohibiting opium, and eliminating drugs are all important tasks. Although punishing bandits and opium are three separate matters, they are intrinsically linked and should be taken into account together. At this time, when rumors are spreading that the ignorant villagers are secretly plotting to plant seeds, if strict prevention and suppression are not carried out, once the planting is completed, it will be impossible to enforce the law, and accusations will inevitably arise, accusing us of tacit approval and connivance. After careful consideration, I can only urgently hope that a special commissioner will come to supervise nearby and jointly form a propaganda team to achieve the effect of joint efforts. It is found that the former Director-General of the Anti-Opium Bureau often came to inspect in person. Now there is an Anti-Opium Committee, which is far away from the provincial capital, making supervision inconvenient. I also request that the members of the committee personally station themselves in southern Fujian to strictly implement the prohibition of planting, so that it can be known who is providing protection, the truth can be clarified, and the local authorities can also express their intentions. In addition to reiterating the ban and strictly ordering my subordinates to earnestly cooperate, I respectfully report this to you and beg your approval. Furthermore, Yunnan and Guizhou have relaxed the ban on planting, and Guangdong and Fujian have water and land connections. Prohibiting planting and transportation is especially difficult to take lightly. In recent years, foreign opium has invaded in large quantities. I hope that everyone will pay attention to it, so that the future of the opium ban may have a chance. Zhang Zhen bows in entreaty."</p>
<h3 id="e75">Siamese Prince Arrives in Shenyang <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Prince Purachatra of Siam was originally scheduled to come to Shenyang on the 30th, accompanied by the Siamese ambassador to Japan, Samathi, and others. The Foreign Affairs Office received an order from the authorities and had already stipulated welcome measures. Later, Samathi had some contact with the authorities and had to come to Shenyang first. On the 28th, he and his wife arrived in Shenyang from Beiping. Zhang Xueliang sent his secretaries Li Yingchao and Shen Zutong to the station to welcome them. Mr. and Mrs. Samathi stayed at the Yamato Hotel at the Japanese station that night. On the 29th, they met with Deputy Commander Zhang. That evening, the Siamese Prince came to Shenyang from Beiping in a specially prepared flower car on the Beining Railway. Shen Zutong, a special reception commissioner from the Border Administration, rushed to Huangguantun Station on the evening of the 30th. When the flower car arrived at the station, he was the first to board the car to welcome him. Ambassador Samathi and his wife also went to the station to greet him. Because the train was delayed, it did not arrive at Huangguantun Station until after 8:00 p.m. At around 9:00 p.m., Zhang Xueliang's representative Rong Zhen, Zang Shiyi's representative Chen Wenxue, reception commissioner Li Yingchao, Foreign Affairs Office staff Wang Jinghuan, Deputy Officer of the Border Administration Yang Zhengzhi, Police Chief Sun Xuchang, Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau Chief Bai Mingzhen, Shenyang Mayor Li Dexin, Shenyang County Magistrate Li Yi, Army Commander Chen Xingya's representative Cheng Guangdao, Japanese Consul in Shenyang Hayashi Kyujiro, and Morishima Mamoru and others gathered at Shenyang Station one after another. The Border Administration also sent a military band to welcome him at the station. The vicinity of the station was guarded by military police. At 10:20 p.m., the flower car arrived at the station in front of the train amidst the welcoming music of the military band. The Siamese Prince got off the train. Qi Dapeng, the Director of the Foreign Affairs Office in Beiping, also came. The reception commissioner introduced them separately and shook hands with the representatives of Deputy Commander Zhang and Chairman Zang and all the welcoming personnel. The Siamese Prince then boarded a specially prepared car (the car that Zhang Xueliang usually rides, which is very beautiful). The rest of the entourage also boarded four cars, accompanied by the reception commissioner to Beiling Villa. After a brief rest, they had dinner and stayed at the villa that night. It is said that the Siamese Prince and his party are scheduled to visit the Arsenal at 9:30 a.m. on the 31st, led by the reception commissioner. At 11:00 a.m., Mi Chunlin, the Director of the Arsenal, hosted a banquet at the factory. At 1:00 p.m., they went to Zhang Xueliang's private residence to pay their respects. At 2:00 p.m., Zhang went to Beiling Villa to return the visit. At 7:30 p.m., Zhang hosted a banquet at his private residence.

In the afternoon at 3:30 p.m., they left Shenyang and took the route through Andong to Japan. (October 31)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Crisis of the Jiguo Railway <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Sharp Decline in Transportation and Difficulty in Covering Losses</p>
<p>Jilin Dispatch: The construction of the Jidun Railway was completed and opened to traffic three years ago. In the beginning, because the area of South Manchuria had just been developed and there were few passengers and goods, it was already making ends meet with difficulty. However, the losses were still limited. It was originally hoped that after a slightly longer period of time, it could gradually enter a better state. Unexpectedly, things turned out differently. This year's business has declined more sharply than last year, and it is necessary to lose about 70,000 yuan per month, which is almost unsustainable. The reason is that the road from the provincial capital to Dunhua passes through the three counties of Yongji, Emu, and Dunhua. Along the line, there are high mountains and ridges, and the trees are lush and vibrant, which is a natural and excellent forest, the so-called Huanghua Songdianzi Forest Farm. At the time of the road's planning, it was believed that the development of this forest farm was the basis of freight transportation, and it was expected that the transportation of timber along the line would be sufficient for the entire road's use. However, in the spring of last year, the Yongheng Official Silver Bank (Provincial Silver Bank) had a dispute with various timber merchants over the forest boundaries. The Bank said that the eight million square li of the forest farm under your management should belong to the Bank. The timber merchants argued that they held licenses issued by the former Forestry Bureau and argued according to reason. The provincial government ordered the Department of Agriculture and Mines to investigate and clarify that the former Forestry Bureau had made a mistake in re-releasing the licenses. After the Provincial Committee meeting, it was decided that the Department should jointly with the Official Silver Bank send personnel to survey the area. The remaining land should be given to the timber merchants. If it is not enough, it should be offset by other state-owned forests, and both parties' forest licenses should be recognized as valid in order to convince them. During this survey period, all felling was suspended pending resolution. The Department followed the order and sent technician Wang Qingsan to survey the boundaries. It has been one and a half years, and it has only recently been completed. The timber remaining along the line of the railway has already been transported. The source of freight has been cut off, and the income has been sharply reduced. Previously, the Official Silver Bank had been repeatedly requested to start felling as soon as possible in order to maintain the railway, but the Bank refused to do so on the grounds that it had been ordered to stop felling. According to the report of the Department of Agriculture, the area of the forest farm was surveyed to be 42,700 square li, which was allocated to the Bank. The amount still falls short and it remains unclear where the timber merchants should be compensated, so the provincial government still needs to consider this issue. Therefore, this case is difficult to resolve for the time being. The opening of the forest farms along the Jidun line will also be far away. The income from freight transport is even more uncertain. According to the Jidun and Jichang railways, the original director of the Bureau served concurrently. Since Han Linsheng was transferred to Tianjin Customs Superintendent, although there have been sayings that Cai Yunsheng or Yu Changfu and Qi Yao would succeed him, it has not been realized until now. This is also because Jidun is losing money and cannot sustain itself, and Jichang is affected by Jihai and can only maintain the status quo. No one wants to shoulder this difficult task. The road was built with Japanese loans, but no interest has been paid yet, so the name of the Engineering Bureau is still used, saying that interest is exempted during the engineering period. However, if this is delayed for a long time, the Japanese side may not raise objections. It is rumored that there is a saying that the loan should be recovered, although it has not been confirmed, it is not without reason. Moreover, there are often bandits hiding along the road who break the road works from time to time, causing no small damage. In the current state of the road, the future seems very dangerous.

<h3 id="e77">Shaanxi County Inspects Cotton Quality <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Strictly Prevent Inferior Quality from Being Mixed In</p>
<p>Maintain the Reputation of High-Quality Cotton</p>
<p>Shaanxi County, Henan, is located east of Luoyang and west of Tongguan, adjacent to Lingbao. The surrounding areas are all cotton-producing areas. The cotton varieties are excellent and are the crown of all cotton in the country. It is also an important route for the export of Shaanxi and Bian cotton. Recently, large merchants from Shanghai, Hankou, and Shaanxi have pooled funds to establish a packaging company, which is about to open. This year's cotton harvest is abundant. Now that the new cotton is on the market, and with the war now over, large ports from Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin have come to set up trading posts for purchasing one after another. However, in recent years, cotton farmers and merchants have often mixed in inferior cotton. Often, good cotton cannot meet the standards when transported out. This year, the Shaanxi County Government and the Chamber of Commerce have established a cotton adulteration inspection center to prevent this malpractice. The regulations are quite strict. The following is an excerpt: (1) This office may inspect all cotton from Shaanxi County and cotton passing through the county to promote cotton merchants' self-awareness and strive for the purity of cotton quality to become the best product in China. (2) For cotton purchased by cotton merchants, after inspection, if it is pure and qualified, an inspection voucher will be issued before it can be shipped. A. Cotton with clean raw materials that is not wet or adulterated is considered qualified. B. Cotton is considered qualified if it does not have flower seeds attached during ginning. C. Discolored or purple cotton must be packed and received separately and must not be mixed with pure cotton; otherwise, it will still be considered unqualified. (3) Regardless of the buyer or seller, if the inspection result is deemed unsatisfactory, a re-inspection may be requested, but the reasons must be stated within 48 hours after the inspection. If the result of the re-inspection is the same as the previous inspection, the applicant must pay the inspection fee according to the package weight. (4) Cotton merchants must not receive or purchase cotton that has not been inspected. (5) If disputes arise in this office that cannot be resolved, the Board of Directors may be reported to hold a meeting to resolve the issue. (6) The expenses of this office will be deducted from the inspection of qualified cotton, with a deduction of five cents per package based on a standard of about 200 catties, which will be borne by the buyer. If the inspection is unqualified, the seller shall pay. (7) All buying merchants and flower merchants must trade fairly at the market price. The seller must not raise the market price, and the buyer must not use their strong capital to force the flower merchant to trade at a low price, causing the flower merchant to force the transaction, causing various malpractices to avoid the risk of compensation. Violators will be subject to penalties.</p>

<p>Mud Beach Suffers Bandit Looting: Cases of banditry have repeatedly occurred in villages near Fengjing. Although efforts have been made to arrest them and sometimes there have been large-scale crackdowns, there are still lawless elements who keep popping up. The villagers are really disturbed by them. On the evening of the 4th, two bandit ships suddenly came to Mud Beach in the western countryside, full of more than twenty bandits armed with knives and guns. They broke into houses and looted, and the villagers were awakened from their sleep. They were watched and forbidden from making any noise. The bandits searched at will for about an hour, took the loot and boarded the ship. Before leaving, six men and one woman were abducted. It is said that the bandits spoke with a Tu-Ke accent, but their appearance could not be clearly recognized at night. The case has been reported to various agencies for investigation and rescue.</p>

<p>Jiang Jigui Case: Prosecutor Appeals. Jiang Jigui, a worker at the Gongda Cotton Mill in Yangshupu, Shanghai, was sentenced to death in the first instance by the Shanghai District Court for killing Cao Buhua and inciting Liu Zijing to assassinate patrolman Wu Yanyao.

<p>Female Student Rescued After Suicide Attempt: On a certain day last month, a young female student, carrying a bundle wrapped in cloth, arrived in Anting by boat from Taicang. She asked a passenger for directions to Huzhou. The passenger, finding her demeanor suspicious, questioned her. She said she was from Fuqiao in Taicang, currently a student at a certain school, and her family ran an oil mill. Unable to bear the abuse from her stepmother, she angrily ran away, intending to go to a classmate's place in Huzhou, etc. The passenger strongly advised her to take the same boat back home. The girl reluctantly and dejectedly returned to the boat. When the boat was near Qianmentang, she suddenly jumped into the river from the stern. Passersby noticed and stopped the boat to pull her out. Her bundle contained 2,000 cash.

<p>Unscrupulous Merchants Exposed for Selling Inferior Seeds: Yuan Hanchen and Zhou Meichun, unscrupulous merchants from Nanqiao Town, Third District (Yangming Township), manufactured over a thousand sheets of substandard silkworm eggs in Shanghai around September of this year. The printing plate used was of a mixed Japanese-Chinese breed. To dispel any suspicion from buyers, they privately carved a seal that read "Verified by the Sericultural Control Office of the Agricultural and Mining Department" and stamped it on the silkworm egg sheets. However, the character "Yan" (驗 - verify) in the false seal was mistakenly carved as "Nian" (捻). Yuan and Zhou, unaware of this error, concealed the inferior seeds in their luggage and transported them to Wuxi to sell them separately. The villagers who suffered losses were countless. Recently, when Yuan and Zhou went to Su Shuqiao to collect payment for the silkworm eggs, the affected villagers appointed Tao Zu'en (currently the chief of the Second Branch of the Qingyang Town Public Security Bureau in Jiangyin County) as their representative. They seized Zhou Meichun and accused him of selling inferior seeds. Zhou Meichun retorted, "If you say these are fake seeds, I can ask the Control Office to write a certificate to prove it." Tao Zu'en agreed and detained Zhou in the township, sending Yuan Hanchen to Wuxi to obtain a certificate from the Control Office. However, after arriving in the city, Yuan Hanchen, knowing that a certificate from the Control Office was impossible to obtain, requested someone (a certain Jia) to write a false letter for thirty yuan. Making matters worse, he mistakenly wrote the character "Di" (締 - establish) in the Control Office as "Ti" (蹄 - hoof). When he brought it back to the township, Tao Zu'en discovered the flaw. Tao charged Yuan Hanchen with three offenses: "selling fake seeds," "privately carving a seal," and "forging official documents," intending to send Yuan and Zhou to the county for prosecution. Subsequently, Wang Xuchu, the owner of the Hongren Silk Shop in Changkang Lane on the road, intervened. As a result, Yuan paid a fine of three hundred yuan, and Zhou Meichun had to sacrifice the seed price of two hundred and ten yuan, receiving no money back. He also spent thirty yuan on entertaining expenses for Tao, which helped end the matter of Yuan and Zhou's three offenses.</p>
<p>Old Woman Burned to Death After Knocking Over Fire Pot: The mother of Liang A'si, a resident of An'geng Village near Dangkou Town, Eleventh District (Nanyan City), was eighty-four years old. In the middle of March this year, she fell ill and was bedridden. Yesterday, her son A'si, because of the cold weather, placed a fire pot near his mother's feet for warmth. Shortly after, A'si went out to shop and locked the front door. Unexpectedly, his elderly and frail mother accidentally knocked over the fire pot, spreading the fire to the bed curtains. The flames quickly intensified, piercing through the roof. Upon hearing the alarm, the police officers from the Seventh Branch of the Public Security Bureau rushed to extinguish the fire, but the entire house was completely destroyed. A'si's old mother, unable to escape, perished in the fire, a truly tragic event.</p>
<p>Director of Education Lu Again Accused: Lu Renshou, Director of the County Education Bureau, has been repeatedly accused since taking office. Recently, more than ten local residents, including Xue Bingzhang, listed four major charges of embezzlement and malpractice against Chen Renshou and jointly submitted a petition to the Education Department.

<p>｜To Eliminate Opinions and Jointly Seek Improvement</p>
<p>｜Enmities and Grievances Temporarily Disregarded, Temporarily Compromise</p>
<p>The alumni association of Nanjing Higher Normal School, Southeast University, and Central University issued a letter to fellow students regarding the current school affairs dispute at the alma mater: "To our fellow students in the alma mater: Over two thousand students have graduated from the alma mater, both past and present. We have always maintained a consistent spirit of continuing the past and opening up the future. To promote the communication of opinions between students and alumni and to maintain the glorious history of the alma mater, the alumni association was born as a result. Since its establishment, the association has been in existence for over half a year and is actively carrying out major tasks such as investigating the service status of students in various places, raising funds to build a grand clubhouse, and printing and distributing association publications. The association is committed to achieving anything that is beneficial to the alma mater and to the students. This sincere intention is shared and trusted by the fellow students of the alma mater. Recently, the alma mater has unfortunately experienced disputes over school affairs. If school administration is neglected on weekdays, accidents will occur in an instant. When discussing the reform of school administration, some people want to take advantage of it. When discussing the movement to protect the school, some people also want to take advantage of it. Intrigue, sow discord, and conflicting opinions make it difficult to distinguish right from wrong. It is said that a certain organization or a certain student makes a statement that may not be made in good faith, but the conspirators are able to exercise their manipulative abilities to the extreme, and those who vent their anger only seek immediate gratification, using others as puppets, and the school has become their sacrifice. In order to protect the alma mater and respect the opinions of the students, the association does not want to participate in the debate. In the past, the disputes became more and more intense, which would inevitably shake the foundation of the school. The executive and supervisory committee resolved at a general meeting to put forward opinions for discussion with the authorities of the alma mater. This memorandum has been repeatedly considered and revised several times. If we dare to send it out, it is because the association has no grudges against anyone, but we hope that this solemn and brilliant alma mater will not be unstable and will not be taken advantage of by ambitious people, so as to fall into an unrecoverable position. To cook beans with beanstalks is not done by those who know. When brothers quarrel, they resist insults from outside. Now the school is in a hurry, and the ambitious will be complacent. The school is not private property, but they regard the school as a conquest. The alma mater has an excellent history, but they want to destroy and erase it. Those who have a conquering attitude or have other ambitions are not enough to blame. What I, a student in school or a graduate, cannot bear is that this solemn and brilliant alma mater is destroyed and trampled on. From now on, the association requests all students to quickly eliminate opinions, unify wills, and jointly seek improvement. All grievances are temporarily disregarded, and all factions temporarily compromise. Those who create happiness for our school should sing and praise it, and those who want to seek their own selfishness in our school should hate it. My classmates only know how to be for the school, not for others. The ancients said, "When doing something, do not be saddened by relatives and friends, but be pleased by those who see it." Also said, "If someone wants to do good, who is not as good as me?" The association is willing to encourage each other with the dear and respectable students. The alumni association of Nanjing Higher Normal School, Southeast University, and Central University."</p>
<h3 id="e98">Lü Miannan's Letter to Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Education <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Lü Miannan's letter to Minister Jiang Menglin says: Honorable Sir, I received an anonymous leaflet a few days ago (I have already sent a copy for your review), consisting of over ten thousand words, vividly and meticulously describing how my actions over the past few years have all been under your direction, and wherever I am mentioned, you are invariably implicated. Such slander is not worth refuting. However, I now have something I wish to report to you, and I hope you will carefully consider it. Since you entered the political arena, you have been advocating the "Greater Peking University Principle." From Director of the Education Department to President of the University District, to Minister of Education, you have consistently used this policy as your sole means. Currently, the national and provincial universities within the reach of the Ministry of Education's power are almost entirely under your control. When you were in Zhejiang, almost all the principals of the provincial middle and primary schools in the province were from Peking University. Anyone from Zhejiang can attest to this. Peking University has a long history and naturally has many talented people. However, if you insist on using the name of Peking University as a rallying cry, maintain factionalism, and create an academic clique, then the bright and splendid history of Peking University will be smeared by your own hand. Thinking of this, I cannot help but sigh deeply. I still remember last year when the students of the National Teachers University sent representatives to the Ministry of Education to petition for the merger of schools. The students threw rattan chairs at you, and you relied on the protection of the military police, trapped in the building for a day and a night. I thought you would surely be furious and punish the students. Who knew that the next day you declared in the newspapers that the Ministry of Education had not offended the students, asking all sectors not to misunderstand, and hastily granted the students' demands, as if afraid of further action. You have been in Peiping for a long time and have experienced many student movements. You are like a bird startled by the bow, and I do not need to reproach you with righteousness. During the summer vacation last year, the authorities and teachers and students of National Central University strongly argued with the National Government and the Ministry for funding. On one occasion, representatives of the faculty and staff arrived at the Ministry. The students had arrived earlier and were talking in another room. After about an hour, you came and said to the faculty and staff representatives, "The funding issue has been negotiated with the student representatives." You then read out the various points loudly and said that you had signed it and given it to the students to take back. At that time, I immediately felt that your actions were very strange, as if your words and deeds had no credibility and needed to be guaranteed by your signature. Moreover, the faculty and staff representatives had repeatedly contacted you without any response, but as soon as the students arrived, you immediately agreed and signed it yourself to win their favor. Your intentions are obvious. Since returning to the country, from university professor to director of general affairs, to acting president, to director of the education department, to president of the university district, to minister of education, there are countless things that can be recorded about the words and deeds of students. I love people with virtue and do not want to embarrass others. The above two examples have long been known to the education community, so I cite them as evidence to make people across the country aware of your character. In short, the deterioration of the domestic academic atmosphere in recent years can be said to be caused by you alone, and it is not an exaggeration. Now that you occupy the highest position in national education, you cannot set an example for young people with a great personality, nor can you show the people of the country a plan for cultivating talents. You only know how to use means and play clever tricks. The future of education is still worth considering. I sincerely tell you this, hoping for your understanding. Respectfully submitted, wishing you good governance. Lü Miannan respectfully.</p>

<p>The Finance Bureau Disapproves of Diverting Education Funds</p>
<p>The Education Department Negotiates to Allocate Previous Arrears</p>
<p>Chen Hexian, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, sent an official letter yesterday to the Jiangsu Education Funding Committee and the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office, stating: "According to the previous letter from your Education Funding Committee, the 21st meeting of the committee resolved to request the Education Department to consult with the Provincial Government and the Finance Department, ordering all county finance bureaus not to divert any education funds, regardless of the item of expenditure, and to implement the method of busy-season grain tax division. (1) Staff members of the Management Office may inspect the accounts of the county finance bureaus at any time, and the finance bureaus shall not refuse to allow inspection under any pretext. (2) The funds divided from daily income may be allocated at any time, etc., requesting that we take note and handle accordingly. We have already forwarded this to the Provincial Government for review and handling. Subsequently, we received instruction No. 7565, which stated, 'The submission has been noted. The Finance Department has been ordered to investigate the case and issue instructions.' You are hereby notified." In addition to sending separate letters, we respectfully request that you take note accordingly.</p>
<p>In addition, the provincial schools in Jiangsu jointly submitted a request to the Education Department, urging the Management Office to quickly raise and distribute funds due to the arrears in funding. The provincial schools in this city received instructions from the Education Department in the middle of last month, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"The submission has been noted. This Department is well aware of the difficult situation caused by the arrears in funding for the provincial schools for several months. In recent months, we have repeatedly urged the Education Funding Management Office to raise and distribute funds. Messengers have traveled back and forth, accumulating piles of documents. The Director of this Department has also personally negotiated in Nanjing and Shanghai. However, the amount of revenue is extremely weak, and raising loans has not been possible for the time being. We have exhausted our efforts, and we believe this is understood by all. Currently, the regular expenses for July have been fully issued by the Management Office according to the new budget. The regular expenses for August and September are still being raised with great effort, with the aim of allocating them in the near future to provide assistance. As for the temporary expenses for the 18th year of the Republic, we will consult with the Management Office to wait for treasury bonds to be used as collateral for cash before properly allocating them in accordance with the resolution of the Education Funding Committee. The temporary expenses for the 19th year of the Republic will be issued after deliberation and allocation."</p>
<p>It is also heard that the August expenses for the provincial schools have been received for half a month last week.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Resolution of the Jiangsu Agricultural Student Unrest <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Fifteen Students Involved in the Trouble Expelled</p>
<p>Classes Resumed and Order Restored at 10 AM Yesterday</p>
<p>The details of the student unrest at the Suzhou Provincial Agricultural School have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that after the incident occurred, the school principal, Liao Jianan, repeatedly telegraphed the Education Department for instructions. On the 4th, he received a telegram from the Education Department, informing the faculty and staff to handle the matter impartially and fairly, and ordering the students to resume classes immediately to avoid severe punishment. He also sent Secretary Huang to Suzhou to mediate. On the afternoon of the 4th, on the student side, because most of the students voluntarily resumed classes, the spirit of student solidarity dissipated. On the night of the 4th, Principal Liao convened a school affairs meeting of all faculty and staff. It was resolved that the students' actions this time were excessive, and it was decided to expel fifteen students who were the ringleaders. The rest who echoed them were given demerits. At 8 AM on the morning of the 5th, Principal Liao convened a meeting of the students in the auditorium of the Second School, announcing that the following eight students of the preparatory course of the Second College—Cui Fu, Zang Zhongchun, Jing Zhichang, Xiang Xuehai, Zhang Dasan, Zhou E, Shen Ruilin, and Wu Xixiang—should be expelled immediately for assaulting teachers and coercing a strike, with the most serious circumstances, and were required to leave the school immediately. The following nine students—Pan Xikang, Li Hongxun, Hua YouNian, Song Fengzhai, Chu Fusheng, Zhu Jingyuan, Xu Zhengshi, Jin Fa, Ye Haokui—were each given two major demerits. The following six students—Wang Qinghao, Fu Zhengfu, Zhang Guoji, Zhao Tashou, Fang Zhenzhong, Xie Jingyuan—were each given one major demerit. Yang Baisong confessed and reported the instigators of the unrest and was given one major demerit as a lenient punishment. The following seven students of the undergraduate course of the First College—Zhao Chuanxu, Sheng Hua, He Sennian, Zhang Shu, Zhou Zhiang, Zeng Yuanpei, Wang Hanxiong—should be expelled for echoing the student unrest and assaulting teachers under false pretenses. Wu Tingchen was given two major demerits as a lenient punishment. Zhang Hancai and Deng Jinpeng were each given one major demerit and two minor demerits. Jiang Yintang was given one major demerit and one minor demerit. The rest of the students who blindly followed were all given lenient exemptions from punishment. The students present did not resist and voluntarily resumed classes, signing their names one after another. Classes resumed at 10 AM. The expelled students left the school immediately. Principal Liao informed the county government of the events that day and reported to the Education Department. However, Xiang Xuehai and Zhou Mou, who were expelled, had gone to the province to report to the Education Department the day before. There are probably no major problems. However, after Dai Qixiang, the director of the preparatory course of the Second College, was dismissed, it is heard that the school authorities plan to no longer establish a director of the preparatory course and will instead appoint two dormitory administrators to be fully responsible for student management.</p>

<p>Sending Letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Education Committee, Requesting Joint Action</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's establishment of a Department of Education, the distribution of school survey forms, and the implementation of cultural aggression have aroused public outrage and opposition from all sectors. The teachers and staff of the Eighth Primary School of the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, who first launched the movement to take over the educational rights of the concession, yesterday sent letters to Yuan [blank], Deng, Liu Zhanen, and Ou Yuanhuai, the Chinese members of the Education Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating: (Omitted above) Recently, newspapers have reported on the opposition of various public bodies and schools to the Shanghai Municipal Council's establishment of a Department of Education and the distribution of survey forms, and their active efforts to take over the educational rights of the concession. You must have heard and seen this. Furthermore, we have read in the Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette, First Series, Second Volume, that the Shanghai Municipal Council is submitting this case to the Education Committee for discussion through the Director of Education and intends to approve and issue it after detailed consideration. We have learned that you are the Chinese members of the Committee, and they are using you to eliminate the opposition from us Chinese. Their cunning intentions and sly methods are enough to make people feel heartbroken and resentful. You have high moral character and are admired by all. Your patriotic enthusiasm is second to none. Perhaps you did not attend the meeting this time, or even if you did attend, you were unable to express your true opinions due to being overwhelmed by the majority. Now that the various public bodies, schools, and conscientious people have exposed their deceit and risen up in opposition, you should resolutely and decisively advocate for the transfer of the educational administrative rights of the concession to the Municipal Education Bureau. With deep emotion and righteous indignation, without considering any potential consequences, those who have joined this movement are all intellectuals, and their reasons are justified and reasonable. They must be more radical. If you can mediate and make the Shanghai Municipal Council also realize that public reason cannot be violated and public anger cannot be defied, dispel their previous conspiracies and implement the transfer of educational rights, the huge storm can be calmed, which would be a blessing for the region. The sovereignty of the country can be preserved, and the Chinese people will be grateful. If you cannot implement this proposal, you should immediately withdraw from the Committee to avoid being used and to protect your reputation. This matter concerns the foundation of the country, and we dare to express our humble opinions, hoping for your understanding. We wish you great peace. Zhang Lixiang, Liu Canfang, Liu Youshu, Shi Maotang, Cao Baoyu, and Zhang Yunying, teachers and staff of the Eighth Primary School of the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, jointly.</p>

<p>The President Expels Eight Students</p>
<p>Wu Zongqing, President of Nanyang Medical College on Xiaoshadu Road in this city, moved the school from Maigen Road to Xiaoshadu Road this spring. Because the various facilities in the school were not rectified, the students were dissatisfied. The students of the school proposed a minimum of four plans for improving school affairs, but the President of the College did not adopt them. The students then convened a general meeting of all students the day before yesterday and resolved to deny Wu Zongqing as the President of the College and asked him to resign voluntarily. Unexpectedly, at 1 PM yesterday afternoon, many armed men suddenly arrived and arrested several student representatives, who were then released. It is said that the school has expelled eight executive committee members of the student union.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Soochow University's Explanation Regarding Shanghai University's Suspension of the Jiangnan University Tennis Tournament <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Xu Minhui, Director of the Soochow University Sports Publication, sent a letter yesterday regarding Shanghai University's suspension of the Jiangnan University tennis match. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the Editor of the Sports Column of the Shanghai News Education News: I read the statement published in your newspaper on November 2nd regarding the suspension of the Shanghai University competition. The letter from Mr. Ni Xiaotong, Sports Instructor of Shanghai University, to your newspaper, states reasons that violate the regulations and deviate from the facts. He judges with his own intentions and uses them as the association's regulations. He was not present at the time and assumes that the situation was as such. This is inevitably self-deceptive, so I must provide a more detailed explanation to avoid misunderstandings among those who sympathize with the sports community. Therefore, I will explain and refute it in detail below:</p>
<p>1.  The original letter states, "According to the charter of the East China Four University Sports Association, if it rains during a ball game, the game may be postponed if both parties agree. If one party does not agree, the game must still proceed." I have served as the chairman of the association for a year and am currently the secretary. I have read the association's charter thoroughly from beginning to end, but I have never seen the statement "If it rains during a ball game, the game may be postponed if both parties agree. If one party does not agree, the game must still proceed." I do not know where Mr. Ni Xiaotong's statement comes from. Where was the charter of the Four University Sports Association printed? I am not talented, but I respectfully ask Mr. Ni to point it out.</p>
<p>2.  The letter also states, "After the first game ended, the referee immediately negotiated with the physical education instructor and players from Jinling University and decided to stop the game. Afterwards, the referee and the Jinling players left the field." I do not know if Mr. Ni's statement is based on fantasy or on the words of one or two students. To state so boldly, "The referee and the physical education instructor and players from Jinling University negotiated and decided to stop the game. Afterwards, the referee and the Jinling players left the field." It is not known that when the game began, the Shanghai University physical education instructor, Mr. Ni, could not be found. The officers, captains, and team members did not know where he was. They had no choice but to have the officer act on his behalf, appointing scorers and linesmen, and then begin the game. When the first game ended, it was pouring rain. The referee first asked Mr. Xu Shaowu, the instructor from Shanghai University, under a large tree, whether to continue the game. The Shanghai University representative agreed to continue the game, but the Jinling University representative believed that the rain and mud had soaked both teams and that they were slipping and falling on the ground, so for the sake of both teams' health, he did not agree to continue the game and asked to postpone it to the morning of November 1st (Saturday). At that time, the judge saw that both sides were deadlocked, so he asked the chairman to convene a special meeting to resolve it. Chairman Xu Shaowu again searched for the Shanghai University physical education instructor but still could not find him. He was forced to have Mr. Yu Tingzhi, the officer of the school, attend as a representative. After a long discussion, Mr. Zhu Peien, the representative from Zhijiang University, cited the volleyball competition held in Shanghai University last year, which was also disrupted by rain. Jinling University asked to stop the game, but Soochow University opposed it, so the meeting decided to postpone it and continue the next morning. There was an example to follow, so it was proposed that there was no need to discuss it further and that the competition should be postponed according to last year's method. If it was still raining the next day, it would be held in the Jinghai Literary Fitness Room. At this point, there was no objection, so it was passed. At this time, Mr. Ni Xiaotong came slowly, and the meeting informed Mr. Ni of the resolution. Mr. Ni then said that if the members had returned and the meeting had decided to hold the competition, then Shanghai University would have to forfeit. Moreover, the sports reporter Mr. Pei from the News Newspaper of Suzhou and a reporter from a certain newspaper were present throughout the meeting. Therefore, it is unclear where Mr. Ni's statements came from. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e111">The Question of the Concession's Department of Education (Zhou Shang) <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Two years ago, I wrote an article for the "Student Lamp" section of the Times News, titled "Shanghai Education," in which I stated that the recovery of the educational rights of the concessions should be immediate. Unexpectedly, the goal has not been achieved, and the other party suddenly announced the establishment of a Department of Education. The Ministry of Education is the highest administrative organ of education in our country. This move by the Shanghai Municipal Council not only disrupts our country's education system but also insults our national dignity. How can this be tolerated? I spent a week investigating the Shanghai Municipal Council's facilities for education in the Public Concession and the emergence of its Department of Education. I respectfully present the information I have gathered in this article to the people of the country.</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Loss of Educational Rights and the Overview of Concession Education <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Educational rights are inherently national rights. Those who provide education do so with the welfare of the community as the prerequisite, and those who receive education must also learn the customs and traditions of the community and abide by its rules in order to join the community. People form a country through the combination of living habits and environmental aspects over a long history. In order to consolidate the foundation of the country and develop culture, the country adopts certain goals and policies for national education. All people under the control of the country must be subject to its control and proceed according to its direction. This right to education is unique to the country, so it is called national right. With national rights, we have the right to formulate educational aims, educational policies, educational supervision, educational decision-making, etc.</p>
<p>Our country's educational rights have been lost for many years. The reasons for the loss of rights are: 1. The proliferation of missionary schools throughout the country. 2. The establishment of colonial schools. Various concessions and the three northeastern provinces are the most notable. The first reason stems from the introduction of Christianity into the Central Plains in the ninth year of the Zhenguan era of the Tang Dynasty, which was a scourge. China was defeated by England and then by the Anglo-French alliance. The Treaty of Nanjing and the Treaty of Tianjin were successively established. The power of Christianity was unapproachable. In the thirty-second year of Guangxu, the Ministry of Education promulgated that foreigners setting up schools did not need to register, planting the seeds of disaster and causing endless harm. The second reason is the concessions and the Russo-Japanese War. After the war, Japan obtained Lushun, and the South Manchurian Railway connected to the Beining Railway, reaching the area directly. The Japanese then expanded from Lushun to the South Manchurian Railway line and extended it to the provincial capital of Fengtian, receiving Chinese children and educating them on their behalf. The purpose was to cultivate obedient subjects and servants to be used by the Japanese. We must recognize that the former type of educational right was abandoned by the Chinese themselves, with no treaty provisions. The latter type of loss of educational rights was mainly due to unequal treaties.</p>
<p>The educational rights of the Shanghai Public Concession include the above two types. The Chinese Public School, Yucai Public School, Gezhi Public School, and Nie Zhongcheng Public School established by the Shanghai Municipal Council are colonial schools. St. Francis, St. Mary's, McLaren, etc., belong to missionary schools. Missionary schools aim primarily at proselytizing and aggression, while colonial schools aim primarily at cultivating obedient subjects. Neither is Chinese education. They hinder our country's educational rights and are sufficient to destroy our country's culture. The Shanghai Municipal Council's recent establishment of a Chinese Education Office to manage the newly established Chinese primary schools in the West and East Districts is just window dressing.</p>
<p>The four public schools within the concession are poorly managed. School administration shifts with personnel changes. All facilities do not contain national characteristics. The curriculum emphasizes English and lacks science. Discipline emphasizes corporal punishment and obedience, despising individuality. Most students go to work for foreigners. It is rarely heard that graduates of these public schools occupy important positions in Chinese society. My younger brother once studied at Yucai Public School on Shanhai Pass Road for three years. Later, he was interfered with by the authorities due to the May Fourth Movement and dropped out of school. Since then, Yucai has not accepted students over the age of sixteen, and tuition has increased to more than forty yuan. The intentions of Sima Zhao are obvious to everyone. Other issues, such as the excessive number of schools and the fact that funding accounts for only 1.07% of the city's revenue, will not be discussed due to limited space.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Ministry of Education and the Education Office <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the discovery of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Department of Education has attracted the attention of the Chinese people. I met with Chen Heqin, Director of the Chinese Education Office, and one or two Chinese members of the Taxpayers' Association. According to them, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Educational Department, translated into Chinese as "Ministry of Education," is listed alongside the Police Department and the Engineering Department. It has been established for more than sixty years, but it has little contact with the outside world, especially with us Chinese, so few people outside know about it. Its organization has a secretary, and the secretary hires an assistant who specializes in the four public schools for Chinese education. It was felt that the administration was not unified and that the assistant was tired of the tedious affairs, so the Department of Education was changed to the Education Office, and Healey was hired as the director to manage all education within the concession. This is evidenced by the fourth issue of the Chinese Weekly published by the Shanghai Municipal Council in April of the previous year. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council's organization is all named after departments, but education is not, which is inevitably suspicious. Chen told me that the change from "Department" to "Office" is indeed a fact but has not been formally approved. It is expected that in the near future, the Shanghai Municipal Council will uniformly change to "Office," at which time it can be formally announced to avoid conflicts with the government agencies of our country.

<h3 id="e116">Regarding the Adoption of a Labor-Management Cooperation Plan <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Report</p>
<p>Following the report, the meeting commenced according to the agenda. First, Hu Shuhua reported on the first case of the third group, which was the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's proposed plan for realizing labor-management cooperation. This morning at 9:00 AM, the review committee of this group and the chairmen and members of each group, totaling 57 people, convened to re-examine the results and amend the various points, and then read the full report as follows:</p>
<p>The following amendments should be made to this proposal. In recent years, factory owners and employees in various regions have frequently experienced disputes due to conflicting interests. In minor cases, production is reduced; in severe cases, factories are shut down, leading to a sharp increase in unemployment. This not only hinders the development of various industries but also affects social stability. The Ministry, in order to realize labor-management cooperation and develop the national economy, now proposes the following plan for whether it is applicable, please submit it for public decision.</p>
<p>1. Both employers and employees must understand the following matters: (1) Factories are profit-generating institutions that both parties rely on for their livelihoods. (2) Factories are places that produce goods to meet the needs of society. (3) The relationship between the two parties is like that of brothers and cannot be separated. Occasional labor disputes, even if unintentional, cause losses to both employers and employees and also affect society. (4) The right to manage the factory is a legitimate function of the factory management.</p>
<p>2. Labor-management contracts must be signed jointly by an equal number of representatives from both parties and reported to the local government for record.</p>
<p>3. The aforementioned contract shall specify the following items: (1) Working hours and methods of compensating for extended working hours. (2) Wage amounts and their payment. (3) Methods of rewards and punishments. (4) The start and end dates of the contract's validity. (5) Whether the contract can be amended by either party before the expiration date. (6) The location and date of the contract signing. (7) The names of the contract signatories. (8) Matters related to local labor-management customs. (9) Other matters.</p>
<p>4. Within possible limits, the factory should establish worker education programs according to the Ministry's published outline of worker education plans to enhance workers' knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>5. The factory should, to the extent possible, provide the following safety and sanitation facilities, depending on the type of industry and work conditions: (1) Safety equipment related to workers' bodies, factory buildings, machinery installations, and fire prevention. (2) Facilities such as hospitals, bathrooms, gymnasiums, and game rooms. (3) Air circulation and toxin prevention equipment in the workplace. (4) Lighting inside the factory and in worker dormitories, and toilet facilities.</p>
<p>6. The factory should, within possible limits, promote the following: (1) Labor insurance. (2) Savings associations. (3) Cooperatives. The benefits of the above items must be explained to the workers frequently to ensure understanding and harmonious progress.</p>
<p>7. On holidays, factories may convene meetings of all workers to lecture on the following topics: (1) Intellectual education. (2) Moral education. (3) Physical education.</p>
<p>8. The factory should, to the extent possible, provide dormitories for workers and assign staff to manage them in order to train their self-governance abilities.</p>
<p>9. The factory should reward workers and use a portion or all of their deserved bonuses and dividends as share capital so that workers gradually become shareholders. When issuing new shares, workers should be given priority to subscribe to deepen the alignment of interests and reduce labor-management disputes.</p>
<p>10. Abolish the contract labor system to prevent foremen from abusing their power and to eliminate past barriers between employers and employees. However, piecework is not subject to this restriction.</p>
<p>11. The factory should pay attention to the actual living conditions of workers' families and local life.</p>
<p>12. The factory should, to the extent possible, conduct tests with workers on the output of each machine per hour to obtain the average output. The names of the workers, raw materials, product names, and the average output should be marked on the machine. Subsequently, those whose output exceeds the original amount will be rewarded, and those whose output falls short will be penalized, thereby increasing work efficiency. However, if the production volume falls short of the original amount and it is not the worker's fault, no penalty shall be imposed.</p>
<p>13. Those who guide the labor movement must understand the following matters: (1) The principles of the Chinese Kuomintang Party. (2) The government's intention to protect workers. (3) The relationship between the Party and labor unions. (4) Their own mission.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Discussion <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>After the report, the chairman announced the discussion. Niu Zaikun proposed deleting the five characters "形同手續之" ("akin to procedures") in the third item of the first article of the amendment. The chairman put it to a vote, but it was rejected due to a small number of supporters. Li Quanshi proposed putting the entire proposal to a vote, and the majority agreed. The chairman then put the amendment to a vote, and it was passed by a show of hands by the entire assembly.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Adoption of the Third Group's Report <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The chairman then stated that the discussion and report for the third group's second to thirty-third proposals (reported on the afternoon of the 4th, as seen in yesterday's newspaper) had been slightly studied by the members, and then the entire report was put to a vote and passed. Thus, all cases of the third group have been completely deliberated.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Fourth Group's Report <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Next, the Fourth Group's review report was discussed, presented by Liu Kuidu. The results of the review of each case were divided into two parts: finance and commercial taxes, totaling three categories, summarized as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e120">Fourth Group's Review Report (A) <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Commercial Tax Matters</p>
<p>The 62 proposals submitted to the Fourth Group all related to finance and commercial taxes. The group resolved to divide them into two parts for review. Apart from the financial matters reported separately, the commercial tax portion consisted of 48 proposals, all of which were reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For the convenience of discussion, they are categorized into three types and reported separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) First Category: Administrative Referral Cases</p>
<p>All proposals whose main purpose pertains to the implementation procedures of administrative aspects are categorized by the group and compiled into simple reports. It seems unnecessary to discuss them in the general assembly. In the future, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will refer them to the relevant authorities for verification based on the group's report. The numbers of the original proposals are as follows:</p>
<p>(15) Proposed Request to the National Government to Unify Egg Tax, Ji Wenquan. (28) Proposed Improvement of Porcelain Special Tax, Jiangxi Provincial Government. (29) Proposed Abolition of Dashengguan Rice Duty Bureau, Huang Zengyue. (19) Proposed Abolition of Sichuan Hardware Special Tax, Li Xingbei. (57) Proposed Abolition of Tax Stations at the Junction of Haimen and Qidong Counties, Qidong Chamber of Commerce. (14) Proposed Improvement of Procedures for Collecting Unified Cigarette Tax, Wu Tingsheng. (4) Proposed Amendment of Stamp Tax Regulations, Deng Yanhua. (24) Stamp Tax Case, Cheng Zhaodong. (62) Proposed Abolition of Chu'an Salt Surtax, Zeng Shuku. (63) Request to Guizhou Provincial Government to Abolish Exclusive Merchant Quota for Purchasing Sichuan Salt, Zeng Shuku. (38) Proposed Uniform Treatment of Chinese and Foreign Cigarette Transport Permits, Huang Zengyue. (61) Request to Stop Jiangsu Province's Business Tax Registration Fee, Wuxi and 41 other Chambers of Commerce.</p>
<p>(2) Second Category: Abolition of Likin Cases</p>
<p>All proposals related to the abuses of likin (internal transit tax) are included in this category. However, since the National Government has already issued a clear order to implement the abolition of likin on a scheduled basis, there is no need for discussion in principle. The group believes that it is only necessary to create a simple report on this desire to abolish likin and request the General Assembly to forward this report to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for submission to the National Government for early implementation. The numbers of the original proposals are as follows: (59) Request for Prompt Abolition of Likin and Tax Reduction, Chenghai County Chamber of Commerce. (60) Request for Abolition of Likin on Schedule to Save Domestic Products, Chao-Mei National Goods Industry and Commerce Joint Association. (27) Proposal to Adjust Commodity Tax Burden to Benefit the People and Maintain Domestic Goods, Wang Jie'an. (30) Proposal to Eliminate Harsh Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies to Save Domestic Goods from Danger, Wang Jie'an. (34) Exemption of Domestic Goods from Transit Taxes, Cheng Zhaodong. (37) Request for Exemption of Harsh Taxes to Protect Domestic Goods, Pan Suchu.</p>
<p>(3) Third Category: Discussion Cases</p>
<p>All proposals that, after review, have been given opinions by the group and are deemed necessary to be submitted to the General Assembly for decision are included in this category. They are combined into eleven topics as follows:</p>
<p>(1) National Standard Import Tariff Case 7·11·33·40·13·5·18·22·26·10· (2) National Goods Export Tariff Case 40·30·46·48· (3) Abolition of Tax Exemption and Rebate for Goods Originating from Enemy Countries 0 (4) Handling of Special Tax Principles Case 6·19·21·34·37·42·35·46·49·51·52· (5) Business Tax 21 (6) Abolition of Parcel Post Tax Case 53 (7) Tax Exemption for Handicraft Products Case 27·58· (8) Tax on Machine-Made Imitation Foreign Goods Case 34 (9) Tax Exemption for Re-Export of Imitation Machinery Case 56 (10) Uniformity of Local Taxes Within the Province Case 24 (11) Tax Reduction for Goods Manufactured by Overseas Chinese Shipped to China Case 17 (All numbers are original proposal numbers and notes)</p>
<p>Although the aforementioned three categories have categorized the 63 proposals separately to clarify their contents, the group's opinions on each case still require a separate, concrete report for reference during discussion. Details are provided separately below. Unfortunately, due to the different nature of each case, the order may be reversed compared to the index, which the participants are kindly asked to understand.</p>
<p>No. 11, Ding Changsheng proposes, "Promptly promulgate a national standard tariff." The review opinion is that the national standard tariff should adopt a protectionist policy, which is justified and should be incorporated into the import tariff case for handling.</p>
<p>No. 33, Cheng Zhaodong proposes, "Implement a national standard tariff." The review opinion is that increasing the import tax rate on foreign manufactured goods is justified and should be incorporated into the import tariff case for handling.</p>
<p>No. 40, Wang Jie'an proposes, "Reduce or exempt export tax on domestic goods and increase import tax on foreign goods." The review opinion is that the principle is justified and should be incorporated into the national standard import tariff case and the amendment of the export tariff case for handling.</p>
<p>No. 13, Tang Bingyuan proposes, "First implement tariff protection policies for cotton yarn and cloth." The review opinion is that the domestic cotton industry already has a foundation, and implementing a protectionist policy will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort. However, due to treaty relations, the increase can only be moderately increased within a considerable range and should be incorporated into the national standard tariff case for handling.</p>
<p>No. 50, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and Fang Jiaobo propose, "Exempt export tax on domestic goods and abolish tax exemption and rebate measures for foreign goods." The review opinion is: (1) The original proposal's principle of not taxing exported goods, as well as the exceptions in categories A, B, and C, are all justified. However, whether it can be implemented in this time of financial difficulty is a matter of fact and should be incorporated into the export tariff case for handling. (2) There is no need to levy taxes on the import of raw gold. Regarding the issue of levying taxes on the import of raw silver, since the drastic fall in silver prices this year, many Chinese and foreign experts have discussed and mostly agreed that it is not appropriate to implement it before improving the currency system. As for levying taxes on the import of rice and flour, it should be determined at any time based on the domestic food supply and demand situation and should be incorporated into the national standard import tariff case for handling. (3) The practice of refunding import taxes for foreign goods exported within one year should be referred to the Ministry of Finance for cancellation.</p>
<p>No. 5, Deng Yanhua proposes, "Exempt locally made matches and their raw materials from taxes and duties, revise the regulations for nitric sulfur passports, and increase the import tax on imported matches." The review opinion is that, according to the current regulations on machine-made goods tax, machine-made goods transported and sold overseas are generally exempt from taxes and likin. Matches, with the approval of merchants, can be taxed as machine-made goods, and those transported and sold overseas can be exempted from export tax. The original request to increase the import tax on imported matches should be incorporated into the national standard import tariff case for handling. As for the passport issuance procedures and the explosive materials duties and taxes currently levied on match raw materials in Guangdong, the Ministry of Finance should be consulted to investigate and correct or abolish them separately.</p>
<p>No. 32, Cheng Zhaodong proposes, "Abolish the artificial silk tax bureau." The review opinion is that the customs duties should be corrected so that no taxes are collected again, and it should be incorporated into the national standard import tariff case. No. 34, Cheng Zhaoxiang proposes, "Exempt domestic goods from transit taxes." The review opinion is that the revision of domestic goods tax rates and the implementation of one tax per item without re-collection is extremely justified. The exemption of transit taxes should be incorporated into the abolition of likin case and reported separately to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance for implementation.</p>
<p>No. 37, Pan Suchu proposes, "Exempt harsh taxes to protect domestic goods." The review opinion is that the exemption of harsh taxes should be incorporated into the abolition of likin and the handling of special tax cases. As for the second and third items in the proposal, they do not fall within the scope of this group.</p>
<p>No. 43, Rong Zongjing and Xu Guo'an propose, "Postpone the special tax on cotton yarn." The review opinion is that the principle of the special tax on cotton yarn is justified, but it should only be implemented after the abolition of likin, and it must be handled uniformly for both Chinese and foreign products.</p>
<p>No. 35, Wang Jie'an proposes, "Exempt heavy taxes on the porcelain industry and dredge the transportation river." The review opinion is that implementing a one-tax-per-item system is extremely justified and should be incorporated into the abolition of likin and anti-special tax case for handling. As for dredging the transportation river, it does not fall within the scope of this group.</p>
<p>No. 53, the Ministry of Transportation proposes, "Abolish the parcel post tax." The review opinion is that this parcel post tax, which replaces likin, should be abolished in the list of abolitions.</p>
<p>No. 57, the Qidong County Chamber of Commerce of Jiangsu Province proposes, "Abolish the tax station at the junction of Haimen and Qidong Counties in Jiangsu Province." The review opinion is to incorporate it into the abolition of likin case and request the Ministry of Finance to forward the order to investigate and handle it.</p>
<p>No. 59, the Chenghai County Chamber of Commerce proposes, "Promptly abolish likin and reduce taxes." The review opinion is to incorporate it into the abolition of likin case for handling.</p>
<p>No. 60, the Chao-Mei National Goods Industry and Commerce Joint Association proposes to abolish likin. The investigation opinion is to incorporate it into the abolition of likin case for handling.</p>
<p>No. 7, Ding Yingfu proposes, "Exempt double taxation." The review opinion is that the original proposal focuses on refunding raw material taxes and should be handled together with other similar cases.</p>
<p>No. 9, Ding Changsheng proposes, "Abolish double taxation on domestic goods." The review opinion is to handle it together with other cases.</p>
<p>No. 17, Zhang Xiangshi et al. propose, "Tax reduction for goods manufactured by overseas Chinese and shipped to China." The review opinion is that this matter is inevitably difficult according to current tariff treaties.</p>
<p>No. 38, Huang Zengyue proposes, "Regarding cigarette transport permits, Chinese and foreign merchants should be treated equally." The review opinion is to propose that the General Assembly decide to have the Ministry consult with the competent authority for handling.</p>
<p>No. 39, Huang Zengyue proposes, "Abolish the new three-tier cigarette tax rate and restore the previous method." The review opinion is to propose that the General Assembly decide to have the Ministry consult with the competent authority for handling.</p>
<p>No. 61, the Wuxi and other Chambers of Commerce propose, "The business registration fee proposed by Jiangsu Province does not comply with the Ministry's regulations; please stop it." The review opinion is to propose that the General Assembly decide to have the Ministry consult with the competent authority for handling.</p>
<p>No. 14, Wu Tingsheng proposes, "Improve commercial taxes." The review opinion is to request a resolution from the competent authority regarding the handling of cigarette stamp affixing and transport procedures.</p>
<p>No. 27, Wang Jie'an proposes, "Adjust the tax burden of commodity tax." The review opinion is that the principle of exempting miscellaneous taxes on domestic goods, industrial raw materials, rice, food, salt, etc., is deemed valid. Regarding tax exemptions for handicrafts, it should be combined with proposal No. 58 for review.</p>
<p>No. 36, Cai Chang proposes, "Plan for commercial establishments." The review opinion is that it seems that a preliminary investigation should be conducted to determine which industries are not present in the country and must be imported from foreign countries, and then a unified plan should be made. As for the suggestion to establish a tax rate committee, the Ministry of Finance has already established a National Tariff Committee.</p>
<p>No. 46, Qian Yizhen proposes, "Increase export tax on soybeans and reduce inland taxes." The review opinion is that the merchants of the three northeastern provinces have already filed a case, and it should be incorporated into the export tariff case and the abolition of likin case for handling.</p>
<p>No. 48, Qian Yizhen proposes, "Exempt silkworm cocoon tax." The review opinion is to request a resolution from the General Assembly to have the Ministry consult and decide.</p>
<p>No. 49, Wang Jie'an proposes, "Levy taxes on foreign factories established in China and business tax on inland sales of foreign goods." The review opinion is that this matter is quite complex, and there are also considerations in terms of implementation. It seems appropriate to request the Ministry to consult with relevant departments for review and decision.</p>
<p>No. 51, Lu Xiaobo and Yu Shushen propose, "Tax exemption for daily necessities and government guarantee of interest for industrial and commercial enterprises." The review opinion is that items such as rice and cotton are large in quantity, and only using inheritance tax to compensate seems insufficient. The matter of guaranteeing interest to revitalize industry should be transferred to the fifth group.</p>
<p>No. 52, Lu Xiaobo and Yu Shushen propose, "Implement one tax per item; consumption taxes should not be too numerous." The review opinion is that the principle is deemed valid and should be adopted as much as possible within feasible limits.</p>
<p>No. 54, the Machine-Made Goods Factory Association proposes, "First remove taxes and likin from machine-made goods and refund raw material taxes." The review opinion is that even if taxes cannot be completely exempted, taxes should be reorganized and refunded on raw materials in principle, but implementation procedures will inevitably be difficult.</p>
<p>No. 56, Chen Dehao proposes, "Exempt re-export tax on well-made imitation machinery." The review opinion is that if the manufactured machinery is indeed well-made, it may be handled by the Special Industry Incentive Review Committee for specific review.</p>
<p>No. 58, the Chao-Mei National Goods Industry and Commerce Joint Association proposes, "Exempt handicraft rules." The review opinion is that the scope of so-called handicrafts should still be determined in advance. The original proposal requested a separate investigation, which is deemed necessary.</p>
<p>No. 4, Deng Yanhua proposes, "Amend the provisional stamp tax regulations and penalties." The review opinion is to request a resolution from the General Assembly for the Ministry to consult with the competent authority for handling.</p>
<p>No. 24, Cheng Zhaodong proposes, "Regarding commercial tax matters, compile opinions from various industries." The review opinion is that local taxes and levies should be uniform within a province. This opinion is valid. Regarding stamp duty, it is the same as proposal No. 4 and can be handled together.</p>
<p>No. 10, the Industrial and Commercial Visiting Bureau proposes, "Raw materials imported for manufacturing finished goods that are then re-exported should be given a tax refund." The review opinion is that the principle is valid, but the implementation procedures should be discussed in detail.</p>
<p>No. 62, Zeng Shuku proposes, "Abolish Chu'an salt surtax." The review opinion is to request a resolution from the General Assembly for the Ministry to consult with the competent authority for handling.</p>
<p>No. 63, Zeng Shuku proposes, "Request Guizhou to abolish the exclusive merchant quota for purchasing Sichuan salt." The review opinion is to request a resolution from the General Assembly for the Ministry to consult with the competent authority for handling.</p>
<p>No. 18, the Jiangxi Provincial Government proposes, "Request the Ministry of Finance to improve the special tax on porcelain to maintain the porcelain industry." The review opinion is that if a special tax on porcelain is levied after the abolition of likin, it should be levied only once, and provinces should not re-levy it. The current special tax on porcelain levied in Jiangxi Province is still a special tax, but those who have already paid the special tax in the province should not be subject to other inland taxes. It should be resolved that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce transfer it to the Ministry of Finance to strictly prohibit it. As for amending the porcelain tax rate and revising the collection method, it should be resolved that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce transfer it to the Ministry of Finance to order the Jiangxi Finance Commissioner to investigate and approve it for implementation.</p>
<p>No. 30, the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association Wang Jie'an proposes, "Proposal to eliminate harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies to save domestic goods from danger." The review opinion is to incorporate it into the effort to promote the abolition of likin and transfer it to the Ministry of Finance for prompt handling.</p>
<p>No. 29, the Director of the Nanjing Municipal Social Bureau Huang Zengyue proposes, "Abolish the Sheng Guan sailing rice donation bureau to enrich the people's food." The review opinion is that it should be resolved that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce report it to the Executive Yuan to order the Anhui Provincial Government to abolish it within the time limit.</p>
<p>No. 19, Li Xingbei proposes, "Request a clear order to abolish the Sichuan hardware special tax and open transportation to benefit industry and commerce." The review opinion is that Sichuan Province's re-levy of special taxes on steel and iron and special transit donations on hardware, as well as its unauthorized ban on the export of steel and iron, all hinder the development of industry. It should be resolved that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce report it to the National Government to instruct the government to abolish the above taxes and bans within 21 years.</p>
<p>No. 21, the Kaifeng General Chamber of Commerce proposes, "Due to the special circumstances of Henan Province, please postpone the handling of donations and taxes to alleviate the people's difficulties." The review opinion is that Henan Province has indeed had special circumstances due to years of military operations. It should be incorporated into the abolition of likin case and handled by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in consultation with the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>No. 6, Yuan Duanfu proposes, "Abolish likin within a time limit and exempt domestic goods raw material taxes and duties." The review opinion is that the abolition of likin has already been clearly ordered, and the government should be requested to implement it within a time limit. If taxes are levied on products, taxes on the raw materials used should also be exempted. It should be incorporated into the abolition of likin case for handling.</p>
<p>No. 15, Ji Wenquan proposes, "Request to use transit passes to exempt harshness and burdens to alleviate commercial difficulties and enrich the national treasury." The review opinion is that the new US tax rate has now been implemented, and its increase in the tax rate on egg imports is a matter of another country's tariff sovereignty and cannot be protested. However, it can be resolved that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce forward it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send a letter to the ambassador to the United States to discuss methods with the United States to reduce the burden. As for the proposed use of transit passes to report and pay half of the tax upon landing and then report and pay the full export tax upon loading on a ship, it can be resolved that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce forward it to the Ministry of Finance for investigation and handling, as merchants can also apply for transit passes under the current regulations.</p>
<p>No. 18, Zhao Jinqing proposes, "Request to abolish various harsh levies in the interior and reduce import taxes on raw materials and increase import taxes on finished foreign goods." The review opinion is that the harsh levies and miscellaneous taxes listed in the original proposal should be incorporated into the effort to promote the abolition of likin and transferred to the Ministry of Finance for prompt handling. Also, the method of reducing import taxes on raw materials is essential for revitalizing industry. However, the items required by various industries from foreign raw materials are numerous. It should be incorporated into the national standard import tariff case, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce should investigate the types and names of foreign raw materials necessary for industry and consult the Ministry of Finance to consider granting reductions and exemptions when setting import reporting rules.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Fourth Group Review Report (B) <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>| Financial Matters |</p>
<p>The Fourth Group, having been entrusted to review a total of sixty-three cases, decided to divide them into two sections: finance and commerce &amp; taxation.  Apart from a separate report on matters related to commerce &amp; taxation, there were a total of eighteen cases related to finance.  Similar proposals were grouped together for joint review, resulting in nine categories: (1) currency system proposals, (2) proposal for the establishment of an industrial and commercial bank, (3) proposal for a national products bank, (4) proposal for a central bank, (5) proposal for the reorganization of industrial and commercial finance, (6) proposal for company securities and commercial paper, (7) resolutions of the International Savings Conference, (8) proposal for fundraising for industrial development, and (9) proposal for government-issued banknotes.  The review opinions on each of the above cases are specifically reported as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Currency System Proposals</p>
<p>(1) Ding Changsheng's proposal to temporarily postpone the adoption of a fictitious standard currency system and to develop domestic industry and commerce to alleviate the financial crisis. (Index 2) (2) Yuan Duanfu's proposal for the national currency to adopt a gold-exchange standard. (Index 3) (3) Cai Chang's proposal to reorganize finance. (Index 45) Three proposals, one advocating for delaying the fictitious gold standard, and one advocating for adopting the gold-exchange standard.  According to the opinion letter of the Ministry of Finance's Gannett, China should gradually implement the gold standard. However, the reviewers believe that this matter is of great importance and requires thorough preparation and a well-defined plan before any action is taken lightly.  If there are conflicting views regarding the import and export of gold and silver this spring, it will provide speculators with a great opportunity, and merchants and people will not know what to follow, which will ultimately harm them.  For the present, it is better to start by reorganizing the current complex and chaotic currency system: (1) unifying silver dollars, (2) abolishing taels and adopting dollars, (3) establishing a fixed issuance system. Then, considering the situation and weighing the circumstances, gradually adopt the gold standard. The Grand Council should quickly collaborate with the Ministry of Finance to appoint domestic experts to conduct detailed research to determine a plan and announce it as soon as possible, as the practical benefits for the national economy and people's livelihood depend on it.</p>
<p>(2) Proposal for the Establishment of an Industrial and Commercial Bank</p>
<p>(1) Deng Shanshan's proposal to establish an industrial and commercial bank to develop foreign trade. (Index 8) (2) The Shandong Agricultural and Mining Department requests a clear order stipulating that each yarn factory may borrow money from national banks at the lowest interest rate to maintain operations. (Index 20) (3) Zhou Shiguan's proposal to organize an industrial and commercial bank that seeks technical and capital cooperation, and to alleviate industry and commerce. (Index 22) Regarding the intention to establish the requested bank, existing banks such as the China Communications Bank and other banks already exist with basic scale. We should leverage and expand existing banks to meet the current financial needs of industry and commerce. Speculative ventures are not allowed in the financial industry. The Grand Council should forward the information to the Ministry of Finance, ordering all banks to fully subsidize and organize any activities that develop industry and commerce, and encourage the business of warehouse receipt financing, while strictly prohibiting speculation.</p>
<p>(3) Proposal for a National Products Bank</p>
<p>(1) Wu Jian's proposal to have the National Products Bank pilot a credit loan program so that small industrialists can obtain raw materials to produce goods. (Index 12) (2) The Jiangxi Provincial Government requests the National Products Bank to establish a branch in Jingdezhen. (Index 41) Both of the above proposals relate to the business scope of the National Products Bank. The Grand Council should notify the bank of the original proposals for consideration and implementation.</p>
<p>(4) Proposal for a Central Bank</p>
<p>(1) Li Kui'an's proposal to reorganize Southwest China's finance. (Index 16) Southwest China has suffered from years of war, and its finances are extremely chaotic. The Grand Council should review the proposal and send a letter to the Ministry of Finance, promptly working with the local authorities of the province to start reorganization, to alleviate the people's suffering.</p>
<p>(5) Proposal for the Reorganization of Industrial and Commercial Finance</p>
<p>Wang Xiaobao's proposal for the reorganization of industrial and commercial finance (Index 47). The business scope of banks is clearly stipulated by their articles of association and approved by the government. Therefore, they cannot exceed the scope. The Grand Council should forward the information to the Ministry of Finance, ordering all banks to comply with their approved articles of association.</p>
<p>(6) Proposal for Company Securities and Commercial Paper</p>
<p>(1) Liu Dajun's proposal to improve financial organization to develop industry and commerce. (Index 26) (2) Huang Shoumin's proposal to order securities exchanges to list and trade company stocks and bonds to facilitate liquidity. (Index 31) (3) Wang Jie'an's proposal to promote warehouse receipt financing to facilitate the turnover of industrial, commercial, and financial capital. (Index 23) The discount, acceptance, warehouse receipt financing, and circulation of company stocks or bonds are urgent needs for the current market in our country. The points raised in each proposal are indeed essential. The Grand Council should collaborate with the Ministry of Finance to order the banking association and the exchange federation to conduct thorough research, determine appropriate measures, and submit a report for review and approval to facilitate implementation.</p>
<p>(7) Proposal for the International Savings Conference</p>
<p>The Yunnan Construction Department's proposal to ban the International Savings Society. (Index 25) Prize-linked savings are a form of gambling that harms society, which is universally known. The government has long issued clear orders prohibiting various lotteries. However, the prize-linked savings of this type, in a disguised form of lottery, are still allowed to exist, which is regrettable. The measures proposed in this case should be unanimously supported and passed by the conference and communicated to the whole country, so the general population knows the harms.</p>
<p>(8) Proposal for Fundraising for Industrial Development</p>
<p>(1) Wang Jie'an's proposal to request the issuance of industrial development public bonds worth 100 million yuan to establish basic industries. (Index 43) (2) Cai Chang's proposal to centralize domestic capital and utilize foreign capital to develop industries. (Index 44) (3) Wang Shaotang's proposal to rescue our country's industries by advocating cooperation and accumulating funds. (Index 55) Now that the military conflict is over, it is natural to concentrate the country's economic power to promote production. Industry and commerce should cooperate to build strength. As for the revitalization of basic industries, it is possible to issue industrial development public bonds. If there are enterprises to establish, foreign capital can also be attracted. Countries worldwide often borrow foreign debts to benefit and develop industries. Our country has suffered many misfortunes, and the people are exhausted, so the construction that follows will inevitably rely on foreign capital. Now that the military conflict has ended, various facilities need to be planned. The points raised in each proposal should complement each other. To attract funds, the following points should be noted: (1) eradicate bandits and communists, reduce the military, (2) establish a budget, clarify official governance, (3) revise laws to protect human rights, (4) reorganize domestic and foreign debts, restore national credit. Once these four are in place, foreign capital can be absorbed according to the principle of equality, and used only for production enterprises. As for the production enterprises to be operated, they should be distinguished by priority and gradually implemented. Labor and capital must be taken into consideration, so that each gets what it wants. Then the future of industrial development will be promising.</p>
<p>(9) Proposal for Government-Issued Banknotes</p>
<p>Liu Mianzhi's proposal to request the government to implement the government-operated banknote exchange law. (Index 1) The matter proposed in this case is unprecedented and of great importance to the future of the economy. Judging from the established practices of various countries and the theories of the world, financial reforms should be implemented gradually. The proposer has been studying this for many years and has put in a lot of effort. The Grand Council should forward the information to the Ministry of Finance for research. The organizational proposals are very complex. My colleagues and I have limited knowledge and are ashamed to be incompetent. I hope the conference will discuss it in detail so that it can be implemented separately. I respectfully submit this for public decision. Chairman of the Fourth Group Review Committee: Bei Kanghou</p>
<h3 id="e122">Approval of Fourth Group Proposals <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Chairman presented the Third Category of discussion, the Commerce &amp; Taxation section, proposal by proposal, for voting.</p>
<p>(1) National Fixed Import Tariff Proposal, a total of ten proposals,</p>
<p>(2) National Products Export Tariff Proposal, a total of four proposals, all passed.</p>
<p>(3) Proposal to Abolish Tax Exemptions and Rebates on Foreign Goods. Members debated the issue of imposing taxes on imported silver and imported rice and flour for a long time. Ding Jingchen argued that silver and rice imports should not be taxed, but if too much is imported, the government can order a ban. Ma Yinchu proposed to retain the proposal. Zheng Hongnian and Li Quanshi supported it. The Chairman put the retained proposal to a vote and it passed.</p>
<p>(4) Handling Special Tax Principles Proposal, a total of eleven proposals, all passed.</p>
<p>(5) Business Tax Proposal, passed.</p>
<p>(6) Abolish Parcel Post Tax Proposal, passed.</p>
<p>(7) Handmade Products Tax Exemption Proposal, a total of two proposals, passed.</p>
<p>(8) Machine-Made Imitation Foreign Goods Tax Proposal, passed.</p>
<p>(9) Tax Exemption for Re-Export of Imitation Machines Proposal, passed.</p>
<p>(10) Local Taxes Should be Uniform Within the Province Proposal, passed.</p>
<p>(11) (1) Tax Reduction for Overseas Chinese Products Transported to China Proposal, passed in principle. Members contributed many suggestions on how to reward Overseas Chinese products. The Chairman stated that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce would adopt them as much as possible. Next, the financial section was discussed. (1) Currency System Proposal, a total of three proposals, passed.</p>
<p>(2) Proposal for the Establishment of an Industrial and Commercial Bank, a total of three proposals. Li Zushen did not agree with the original proposal and advocated establishing a new bank. He requested that the original proposal be resubmitted for review. Some people also advocated that the original proposal be completely withdrawn. The Chairman put the resubmission for review to a vote, and it passed.</p>
<p>(3) Proposal for a National Products Bank, a total of two proposals, passed. (4) Proposal for a Central Bank, passed.</p>
<p>(5) Proposal for the Reorganization of Industrial and Commercial Finance, passed. (6) Proposal for Company Securities and Commercial Paper, passed.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Convene Drafting Committee <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>At this time, Kong Xiangxi announced the conference declaration and urgently needed to be drafted. Please ask the drafting committee members to stay and not disperse. Therefore, the committee members went to the review room together to discuss the drafting.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Zheng Hongnian Strives to Reward Overseas Chinese Products <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Industrial and commercial conference members Mei Rumei, Zhang Xiangshi, and Jiang Zhengya proposed the original proposal on granting national product treatment and tax reduction to overseas Chinese products. Four methods and six restrictions were formulated. After the review committee changed them, they were submitted to the conference. Zheng Hongnian strongly argued that this matter is of great importance to overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese have made great contributions to the motherland. Overseas Chinese remittances reach 200 million yuan every year to make up for the trade deficit, which is the most obvious. Therefore, the conference should be requested to pass the principle of recognizing national product treatment, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce should formulate other reward measures. However, due to the hurried time, there was not enough time for discussion, and the original review plan was still passed. However, it has been recognized that rewards are necessary, and it can also be seen that Chinese people have a considerable understanding of the welfare of overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Zhang Xiangshi Talks About National Consumption Case <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xiangsi discussed that this industrial and commercial conference was held in the capital, and various proposals reached more than 400, which were of great importance to the future of the national economy. Yang Rumei and Cai Zhengya and I jointly proposed the organization of a rationalization research association for national consumption. On the surface, it seems passive, but it is actually extremely closely related to the various production industries. The spirit of the proposal is not only to save money, but also to increase consumption efficiency, which has a direct and good impact on the solution of the food problem and indirectly saves the society capital and labor. Now the conference has passed the opinions of the review committee. Although it has submerged the spirit of the original proposal, its importance has been generally recognized. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is willing to promote organization as soon as possible after the meeting, which can help the industrial and commercial management.</p>

<p>The members of the declaration drafting committee of the Industrial and Commercial Conference were originally scheduled to hold a meeting on the afternoon of the 5th to decide on the drafting outline.

<h3 id="e133">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Urges Prompt Implementation of National Tariff Regulations <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, Our Chamber has investigated and found that the tariff import regulations promulgated by the National Government on December 7, 1928, were implemented on February 1, 1929, with a fixed validity period of one year. Meanwhile, the National Tariff Commission was tasked with extensively revising the import regulations in preparation for their promulgation and implementation upon expiration. The initial tariff regulations largely followed the old provisions of the previous Tariff Conference in terms of tax grades, which were far from meeting protective policy requirements and urgently needed detailed revision. Subsequently, due to rising gold prices, tariffs were converted to gold units, and this validity period of the import tax, originally set for one year, had to be extended for another year. It is now reported that the draft import tax regulations proposed by the National Tariff Commission have been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and passage and were expected to be promulgated on National Day this month. However, after waiting for a long time, no promulgation has been seen, causing deep anxiety among the industrial and commercial sectors. Affiliated trade associations and other groups have repeatedly requested that we submit a petition urging action. We hereby report the situation in a telegram, requesting your esteemed Ministry to review and approve it, forward it to the Executive Yuan, and swiftly issue a clear order for implementation so that the nation's policy of protecting industries can be thoroughly implemented at an early date, which would be greatly beneficial to the public. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3 id="e134">A Glimpse of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Reorganization of Operations <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company decided to become state-owned, the new Director-General, Li Zhonggong, has begun to reorganize its operations. The newly established expansion of navigation and the division of responsibilities are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Resumption of Yangtze River Liner Service: After Li Zhonggong telegraphed to request the release of the company's Yangtze River ships leased by the Transportation Department, the Jianghua vessel returned to Shanghai yesterday. The Jiangxin and Jianguo vessels are also expected to arrive in Shanghai today. The Jiangjing vessel, which was scheduled to start service yesterday, had its boiler damaged during launching and requires repair, so the Jiangyu vessel, which has been out of service for the longest time, was assigned to replace it. Currently, among the company's Yangtze River ships, excluding the Jiangtian and Jiangda vessels, nine ships are expected to resume service from this Saturday.</p>
<p>Operational Division of Responsibilities in the Business Department: Director-General Li considers the Business Department to be the most important part of the entire company, with the prosperity or decline of business depending entirely on the department's proper management. With each ship about to resume operations, the internal affairs of the Business Department urgently need reform and revitalization. After yesterday's temporary meeting of the Reorganization Committee, it was decided to divide the responsibilities of the Business Department into eight sections: (1) Cargo Handling Section: Handling cargo tallying for ships and warehouses, allocating cargo to ships, and negotiating compensation for branch warehouse ships, etc.; (2) Reconciliation Section: Verifying the increase or decrease in watermen's wages and passenger expenses, and auditing the income and expenses of branch warehouses and wholesalers; (3) Inspection Section: Handling cases of watermen's wages being stolen or omitted on each ship and in each bureau, and cracking down on smuggling of private goods on each ship; (4) Statistics Section: Investigating cargo loads and compiling passenger statistics; (5) Schedule Section: Handling ship scheduling, repairs, coal, hardware, advertising, etc.; (6) Passenger Section: Handling passenger tickets, organizing passenger seating, and forwarding mail; (7) Correspondence Section: Receiving, dispatching, and storing documents; (8) Customs Declaration Section: Declaring and loading military supplies and goods, and liaising with customs. It was also stipulated that documents arriving at the department should be reviewed by the department head and deputy manager, who would then assign them to each section for handling. After receiving the documents, each section should quickly study them and submit a memorandum outlining the proposed method of handling to the department head for approval. This new method will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Continued News on Opening a Navigation Route to Weihai: In the past, the delivery of mail to Weihai was exclusively handled by British Taikoo ships. Because the British government had offices, businesses, and expatriates in Weihai, it ordered the Taikoo Company to send a ship every three days. Fearing that there would not be much cargo or passengers at the port, the British government subsidized 4,000 yuan per year to the North China Shipping Company to operate the route concurrently for carrying mail. Now that Weihai has been returned to China, this subsidy has been discontinued. The Business Department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in order to expand its navigation routes, had Deputy Manager He Molin draft a letter to the Post Office and submit a request to the Ministry, citing the precedent of the British government's subsidy, to request an annual subsidy of 4,000 yuan to help open a navigation route to Weihai. It is reported that this proposal has not yet been agreed to by the Post Office and will continue to be vigorously pursued in order to maintain navigational rights.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Water Rates to Be Paid at Original Rates <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association's Reply to the Dilong Company's Inquiry</p>
<p>The Dilong Company wrote: "To the Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association, Regarding the water company's increase in water rates in the concession, your association and other groups have repeatedly protested and opposed it. Although the goal has not been achieved, it has been reported in the newspapers that a decision has been made to first investigate the company's accounts and then determine a solution. It also seems that a notice has been published in the newspapers to temporarily pay at the old rate. However, our company has now received the water company's bill, and the water rate is still being increased. Our company believes that since we Chinese groups have a prior agreement, how can we act alone? However, the company's bill collectors have repeatedly urged payment, which is really annoying to deal with. We are writing specifically to inquire whether we should pay or not, and we kindly ask you to provide guidance so that we can follow it for the public good. Respectfully, the accounting department of the Dilong Company, 638 Shanxi North Road, Concession, November 4th."</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Concession replied: "To the Dilong Company, We have received your letter of the 4th and are aware of everything. Since the water rate is still under investigation and has not yet been determined to be increased, all payments should be made at the original rate (i.e., 6% of the rent). The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already clearly implemented this, and the Shanghai Real Estate Association has also published a notice in the newspapers. Our association has also declared this to the Shanghai Waterworks Company. If the company resorts to coercion, please inform our association immediately, and our association will negotiate a solution. Your company's respect for public opinion is admirable and is worthy of emulation by our residents. We are replying accordingly. We hope you will take note."</p>
<h3 id="e136">Recent News on Yangtze River Shipping <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Congestion of Jiangxi Goods: Due to the disturbances caused by the communists in Jiangxi Province, the central government sent troops to suppress them, causing the passenger and cargo transportation on the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway to be suspended for some time. In the past month, there was a shortage of goods coming to and from Jiujiang. Recently, the central government's suppression troops have successively arrived in Jiangxi, and cargo transportation on the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway has begun to recover. The downriver goods accumulated in Jiujiang have been shipped to Shanghai in large quantities since this week, and there have been telegrams urging the loading of export goods. The Yangtze River ships are competing to transport them.</p>
<p>Increase in Ships by the Sanbei Company: The new Ningxing vessel of the Sanbei Company in Shanghai was released by the Transportation Department yesterday and immediately dispatched to the Yangtze River. Furthermore, because there is more cargo being transported from Shanghai to the upper reaches, and the original Dexing and Changan vessels cannot yet resume service, the company has temporarily leased the 600-ton Guangji vessel from Xu Zhongxin of the Daxing Company, renaming it Guangxing. Today, it will depart from Shanghai fully loaded with Swedish matches for Hankou.</p>
<p>Foreign Vessels' Operations: The operations of foreign vessels on the Yangtze River, such as those of Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson, are not as good as those of the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha. An investigation of the past eight days shows that the most important export cargo on the Yangtze River, cotton cloth, was carried by Nisshin Kisen Kaisha (5,606 pieces), Butterfield &amp; Swire (2,686 pieces), and Jardine Matheson (1,849 pieces). The second most important cargo, white sugar, was carried by Nisshin Kisen Kaisha (23,785 bags), Butterfield &amp; Swire (11,221 bags), and Jardine Matheson (8,338 bags). Kelp was carried by Nisshin Kisen Kaisha (9,325 pieces), Jardine Matheson (2,164 pieces), and Butterfield &amp; Swire (914 pieces). Cigarettes were carried by Jardine Matheson (3,547 boxes), Nisshin Kisen Kaisha (2,540 boxes), and Butterfield &amp; Swire (811 boxes). In the past, Butterfield &amp; Swire had a monopoly on the transportation of longans and lychees on the Yangtze River, but since last month, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha vessels have also been carrying these goods. The rapid progress of Japanese shipping can be seen from this.</p>

<p>On the 20th of last month, a fishing boat was caught in a storm outside the Wusong port and capsized. Seven fishermen, including Yan Linkui, were in danger of drowning. Fortunately, the Rokko Maru passed by and did its best to rescue them, bringing them to Shanghai. After they arrived in Shanghai, Director Yuan Liang of the Public Security Bureau dispatched police officers to properly resettle the victims and provided them with travel expenses to return to their hometowns. Director Yuan sent a letter to the Japanese Consul General, Shigemitsu Aoi, yesterday to express his gratitude. Director Yuan also sent thank-you certificates to the captain and crew members of the Rokko Maru who contributed to the rescue to recognize their efforts.</p>

<p>Shanghai Bureau Will Prevent Cables from Landing on the East Bank</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications is actively planning to recover the telephones installed by the China &amp; Foreign Telephone Company in the Chinese area, but the China &amp; Foreign Company has recently intensified its efforts. An investigation revealed that the company's telephones in Pudong originally used underwater cables laid under the Huangpu River to connect to the east bank. The entire line has 75 pairs. Currently, the company has replaced the old cables, which have been damaged over the years, with new cables containing 150 pairs, which is twice as many as before. It is reported that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau has reported this to the Ministry of Communications and has stated that in order to facilitate business contacts, it will allow the company to maintain its existing operations until the Pudong branch bureau is established. However, if the company wants to expand its lines, the Shanghai Bureau will prevent its cables from landing on the east bank.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Additional Military Equipment for Railway Station Protection <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Due to the approach of the winter defense season, the Shanghai-Jiashan section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Police Department urgently needs to strengthen protection. The old and new cargo warehouses at the South Station are located in a vast area, and the Riyuegang Station is close to the branching waterways of the Huangpu River and has a large amount of cargo. The North Station material depot is located in an open field. Additional police officers must be assigned to patrol these key locations. However, the original firearms used by the section are insufficient to meet the needs. Therefore, Zhuang Shouhua, the police chief of the section, submitted a request to the two railway police headquarters for the allocation of ten additional firearms and pistols for the winter defense period for use in protecting commercial goods.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Wuling Ship Attacked by Bandits En Route to Hankou <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The bandits in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are now fleeing upstream. There are still traces of bandits lurking along the river above Shashi. This time, the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's Wuling Maru was attacked by bandits after passing Shashi on its way from Shanghai to Yichang. The Japanese Navy stationed on the ship opened fire with machine guns, firing 400 rounds at the bandits on both banks, and the bandits were finally dispersed. Unexpectedly, when the ship was returning to Shanghai from Yichang, it encountered a large number of bandits again as it approached Shashi. As the ship sped downstream, it was fired upon by bandits with several cannons. The Wuling Maru was hit by two shells. Fortunately, the shells were made of rotten nails and scrap iron and were old-fashioned earthen cannons, so the firing power was very weak. Although the ship's hull was slightly damaged, the crew and passengers were safe and sound, only suffering a scare. Later, the Navy stationed on the ship fired 300 rounds of machine gun fire, and only then were the bandits repelled. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Dapu Guardian Police Killed: Yesterday, a passenger from Dinghai arrived in Shanghai and told reporters that the Jintang Li Port of Dinghai was looted by pirates, and the Dapu merchant ship from Ningbo to Dinghai was carrying passengers and sailed to the mouth of Dapu when it encountered more than a dozen pirates with wooden guns who fired at the ship. The ship's guard police came out to fight back and two of them were shot dead by the bandits and their bodies were abandoned in the sea. The bandits took over the ship and ordered the crew to take the bandits to Li Port for looting. The entire city was robbed and no one escaped. Four members of the local defense team were shot and killed by bandits and their military equipment was seized. Then they looted the stolen goods and boarded pirate ships, escaping by sea.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Charity Group Assets Must Not Be Changed Without Authorization <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Nor May There Be Any Concealment or Failure to Report</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Notice regarding the fact that the Social Affairs Bureau reported that the Charity Group Property Reorganization Committee reported that committee members such as Mo Heng proposed at the fifth regular meeting that cases of charity groups changing property without authorization and concealing or failing to report should be handled as follows. After deliberation, it was resolved to submit a request to the municipal government to issue a notice for all charity groups to comply with: (1) No property may be changed without authorization during the reorganization period; (2) All property of each charity group must be reported truthfully to the committee. Any false or incomplete reporting will be severely punished. An investigation revealed that charity groups changing property without authorization is a violation of the law and creates many malpractices. Since the establishment of the committee, it has begun to promote the reorganization of the property of various charity groups. If each charity group must change property, it should wait until the committee's reorganization is completed before handling the matter appropriately. Furthermore, the committee's investigation of the property of charity groups in the city should be as detailed as possible and should not omit anything. However, each charity group may have a considerable history and the staff has been replaced several times, and there may be omissions in the transfer of responsibility. Or the management may be improper, and public property has been converted into private property. Therefore, if there are cases of false reporting, the committee's eyes and ears may not be able to see everything. If a warning is not issued in advance, it will be difficult to handle in the future and will have a great impact on charity work. Therefore, we must report this matter. We respectfully request your approval and transfer it for implementation. Furthermore, before the reorganization of the property of each charity group is completed, it will be temporarily suspended. This has been approved by the Fifth One Five Directive of the Finance Bureau and has been notified to all charity groups for compliance. The committee's regulations also have strict provisions that all property of each charity group must be reported truthfully. The committee's request is to prevent the occurrence of disputes and avoid obstacles to the reorganization, which is not without reason. Therefore, we have prepared a document to report and respectfully request your review and approval to issue a notice for implementation, which is in the public interest. Therefore, an investigation revealed that the property of charity groups is the foundation of relief work. Unauthorized disposal is a violation of the law and creates many malpractices. Before the reorganization is completed, all changes will be temporarily suspended. This was previously announced. According to the previous report, it is appropriate to announce to all that they must comply and must not change anything without authorization or conceal or fail to report it, which may cause inconvenience. Sincerely announce."</p>

<h3 id="e153">The Unification of Traditional Chinese Medical Practitioners <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Talks by the Standing Committee of the Citizens Training Council</p>
<p>Since the municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine organizations, such as the Shenzhou Medical Association, the Chinese Medical United Association, and the Traditional Chinese Medicine Society, were ordered by the Citizens Training Council to merge into the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association, a sudden incident occurred the other day in which forty-eight people, including Xu Xiangzuo, declared their withdrawal from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association. To understand the truth of the matter, a reporter from the Guomin News Agency paid a visit yesterday to Chen Yijun, the Standing Committee member of the Citizens Training Council of the Municipal Party Headquarters, to inquire about his opinion on the matter. He replied as follows (the following is the statement of Committee Member Chen): Upon investigation, the municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine organizations have never had a unified organization. The Shenzhou Medical Association, the Chinese Medical United Association, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Society, and the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association each established their own banner and were not subordinate to each other. In the spring of this year, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association came to the Party Headquarters to apply for registration. After investigation, it was found that most of the members of the association were also members of the other three associations. The initiators and important personnel of the other three associations had also joined the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association. In order to promote the strength of the Traditional Chinese Medicine organizations, the Party Headquarters approved the association's registration to form a formal legal organization. Subsequently, the remaining associations also came to the Party Headquarters to apply for registration one after another, and were separately instructed to cease activities and merge into the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association for the sake of unification. Currently, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Society has already complied with the Party's order to merge. However, it is rumored that the Chinese Medical United Association has encountered some turmoil due to the accumulated public funds in the association, but it is not yet known for certain. Only the Shenzhou Medical Association has been making excuses, claiming to be an academic organization, different from a professional organization, and has repeatedly come to the Party Headquarters to request registration and exemption from merger. However, after investigation by the Party Headquarters, the Shenzhou Medical Association's actions over the years are inconsistent with the purposes of studying medical principles, etc., as stated in Articles 2 and 3 of its charter. For example, holding regular meetings, studying medical principles, establishing specialized medical schools, publishing medical books and newspapers, establishing hospitals, constructing libraries, compiling medical lectures, holding national medical exhibitions, or displaying and reviewing specialized medical terms to ensure a unified standard, improving the manufacturing methods of pills and powders, publicizing public health, and designing epidemic prevention, etc., have not been carried out one by one. Its important work is only to handle the registration of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners with the Health Bureau twice a year, and its daily work is no more than mediating disputes among colleagues regarding professional matters. Therefore, although it claims to be an academic organization, it is actually a professional organization. Therefore, in order to achieve the unification of Traditional Chinese Medicine organizations and reduce the membership fees of doctors, the Party Headquarters has repeatedly instructed that registration should not be approved and that it should still comply with the merger order. This is the general situation of the case in the past. As for the declaration made by Xu Xiangren the other day to withdraw from the membership of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association, the reason is actually that during the preparatory meeting of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association held at the beginning of this month, someone put forward a certain report that seemed to refer to the accumulated public funds of the Chinese Medical Society. In fact, the proposer may have had some misunderstandings. Also, the preparatory meeting of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association was not reported to the Party Headquarters beforehand, so the Party Headquarters did not send personnel to attend and guide it, which led to the occurrence of the misunderstanding. It was indeed the fault of the association. However, once the misunderstanding between the two parties is explained and clarified, the opinions will be completely eliminated, and the dispute can be resolved immediately, and the merger issue can also be completely completed. Moreover, at a time when the new and old medicine (i.e., traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine) are fiercely competing with each other, Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners should unite and work together, deeply study medical theories, and strive to promote and conform to science. On the one hand, it can promote the inherent medical spirit of our country, and on the other hand, it can also adapt to the evolutionary trend of world medical science. This is also an important reason why the Party Headquarters ordered the association to merge and organize.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Minutes of the Meeting of the Wusong Machinery Factory Union <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Since Wang Chunzu, the general manager, and Li Bowen, the inspector, of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway General Machinery Factory in Zhanghuabang, Songnan, realized at the end of last year that the contracting system was not only unable to save money for the railway bureau, but also caused the workers to suffer greatly, with only the contractors being able to make a large profit, they specially requested and obtained approval from their superiors to abolish the contracting system and planned to conduct a trial run for half a year. They immediately recruited more than 100 workers and explained that if the results of the trial run were better than the contracting system, they could be promoted to permanent workers after six months. However, eight months have passed now, and no one has been promoted yet. Moreover, during the trial period, the carpentry department alone produced 20 fourth-class cars and 5 steam-powered automobiles. According to accounting, the company can earn a profit of 8,000 yuan, and the results are not bad. Unexpectedly, the railway bureau issued a notice two months ago, intending to restore contracting and recruit people to bid, and the workers did not know the details, which caused misunderstandings and disputes. Later, the workers elected representatives to petition their superiors to abolish contracting, but to no avail. Afterwards, they heard that the bidding was held at the railway bureau on the 23rd of last month, and Wu Cairong won the bid with the lowest price. The workers suspected that Wang, the general manager, and Li, the inspector, intended to restore contracting. On Monday morning at 9 o'clock, during the weekly memorial service at the factory, they proposed to petition their superiors again. At that time, Wang and Li happened to walk to the meeting place, which led to a conflict. The factory director, Ma Erhui, came forward to mediate. Then, the reorganization committee sent two representatives to meet with the Wusong Machinery Factory Union representatives Cai Jinhai and Tang Xinglin, as well as the carpentry representative Wei Derong, to visit Deputy Director Luo of the Shanghai General Affairs Section. After the representatives reported the above situation, Director Luo instructed the representatives to return to Songnan and order the workers to continue working as usual and wait for a solution. Therefore, on Tuesday afternoon after work, the workers went out to the Xujiahui Machinery Factory Union to hold a meeting. 295 craftsmen from various departments attended the meeting. The meeting began at 5 o'clock, with rituals as usual. The temporary chairman was Wang Arong, and the recorder was Zhang Yunhong. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, representative Cai Jinhai reported that Director Luo had stated that Wang, the general manager, and Li Bowen had no authority to abolish or restore the contracting system, and that this was an order from their superiors. The workers had misunderstood and that such misconduct had been discovered. In short, the railway bureau wanted to develop and seek convenience, and now 18 of the most needed vehicles should be built quickly, so they had recruited people to bid in order to expedite the project and ensure that the car bodies were sturdy and well-made, and there was no other intention. Then, Zhu Derong explained to the director that the factory's workers could also build these vehicles quickly and ensure that the project was sturdy and well-made. Director Luo allowed the factory's workers to build the vehicles themselves, but they had to elect two responsible representatives to discuss the procedures with the union representatives before starting work. After the report was completed, the crowd discussed the project matters and elected responsible representatives. By the time the meeting ended, the bell had rung seven times. The dispute can also be said to have come to an end.</p>

<p>The Candle Industry Association convened a general meeting at 1 pm on the 3rd to reject the union's request for a salary increase and abolish the old practice of giving away flower candles. 44 members attended, chaired by Tong Guanwen. The agenda was as follows: 1. Discuss the union's letter requesting a salary increase. Resolution: Since the labor-capital conditions of the industry were revised by the Social Bureau in the winter of the 17th year [of the Republic], the capital side has suffered many losses. At this time, when the sales of candles have plummeted, there is no room for negotiation on the union's demands, and a letter should be sent to reject them. 2. The industry has a long-standing practice of giving away flower candles, etc. Although the previous general meeting resolved to cancel it and issued a notice, some colleagues are still hesitant. How should this be resolved? Resolution: Another notice will be published to thoroughly abolish the purpose of giving away. If anyone is found to be acting against the rules, they will be punished according to the public agreement. 3. Discuss other important matters. Resolution: Confidential. The meeting adjourned after the agenda was completed.</p>

<h3 id="e163">The Comprador of the Zhibade Wheel Reports on the Xiao Case <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Hoping the Overseas Chinese Federation Will Provide Detailed Instructions</p>
<p>Willing to Comply Within the Possible Range</p>
<p>The Xiao Clan Support Association Issued a Declaration Yesterday</p>
<p>The case of the Chief and Second Mates of the Dutch Java Company's Zhibade Wheel insulting Ms. Xiao Xinan has aroused public outrage. The Zhibade Wheel recently returned to Shanghai, and the wheel's comprador, He Jinrong, specially invited people from all walks of life to a banquet on the wheel yesterday afternoon to clarify everything. More than a dozen reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended. The wheel's new owner, Primus, was also present to entertain the guests. First, He Jinrong delivered a speech, detailing the circumstances of Ms. Xiao's experience on the wheel that day. He also said that today's banquet was entirely in his personal capacity to report the truth to everyone. He is also Chinese, and after hearing the news at the time, he deeply hated the rudeness of the Dutch and had no reason to favor them. He also said that the company had dismissed the offending Chief Mate Lan Qi and Second Mate Lei Dima, and the owner, Bailaosi, and the doctor had been demoted to other wheels. The manager of the Xijiang branch officially apologized to Ms. Xiao. As for the legal punishment of the Chief Mate, it should be resolved by the court, and the company has no right to intervene. He heard that the Overseas Chinese Federation and other groups were very dissatisfied with the company's handling of the matter, and it would be best to put forward opinions and provide detailed instructions, and to contact the Shanghai Java Company directly for consultation. Within the possible range of the company, it would be willing to comply with the order. Finally, he led the guests to visit the cabin where Ms. Xiao resided. It is said that Ms. Xiao was introduced to He by her friend on the Haiden Wheel and asked to take care of her along the way. Initially, she lived in Room 33, sharing the room with a Fujianese woman in her forties. After passing Hong Kong, Ms. Xiao moved to Room 35 next door due to seasickness, and lived alone, which led to this unfortunate incident. They dispersed at about 4 pm.</p>
<p>Regarding the incident of Ms. Xiao Xinan of Yixing being insulted abroad, her relatives in Shanghai, Xiao Li, Xiao Kai, Xiao Xu, Xiao Huitian, Xiao Zhaokang, and others, believe that although this matter has received enthusiastic assistance from various maritime groups, it has not yet achieved the goal of punishing the perpetrators. It is by no means enough to merely dismiss the Chief and Second Mates. On the 2nd of this month, a Xiao Clan Support Association was formed. The declaration issued by the association yesterday is recorded as follows: To the Shanghai newspapers, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and party headquarters, legal organizations, and schools at all levels: In recent years, the repeated oppression of our overseas Chinese by Dutch imperialism has been a bitter pill to swallow, and it has not been a matter of one day. Such as the imposition of entry tax on overseas Chinese, the expulsion of overseas Chinese teachers, the prohibition of reading the Three People's Principles, and the refusal to hold memorial weeks, all kinds of bizarre tricks have emerged endlessly, and their ambitions have not been curbed. Now, there has been the occurrence of the insult of Ms. Xiao Xinan. Since the exposure in the newspapers, all compatriots have been outraged. The members of our association, with family ties and a sense of unity, feel particularly indignant at this tragic situation. Ms. Xiao lost her father at a young age and came from a poor family. She studied hard from elementary school to normal school. She is cheerful and courteous to others. She possesses the virtues of diligence, prudence, solemnity, frugality, honesty, and steadiness. She has served in the Central District Experimental School and other schools in the capital, and her teaching achievements are remarkable. Teachers and students deeply admire her. This time, introduced by the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau, she did not hesitate to travel far and wide to serve overseas Chinese education in Southeast Asia. Unexpectedly, she encountered an unexpected disaster on her journey. She was not only rudely insulted by the Dutch but also falsely accused by the doctor, which was extremely dark. Ms. Xiao is over thirty years old and still a virgin. She has aspirations for all directions, but Heaven did not bless her, and she suffered a tragic misfortune. Alas, who does not have sisters, wives, and daughters, who does not have relatives? There are quite a few Chinese women who go to the Dutch colonies, so there may be many who have been insulted in the past but dared not speak out. How can it be enough to merely dismiss the Chief and Second Mates? If it is not thoroughly investigated, not only will the victim's grievances be difficult to redress, but also all Chinese women going abroad will be wary. It is a matter of international prestige and national humiliation. We hope that kind people at home and abroad will uphold justice, express sympathy, and unanimously support and punish the perpetrators. We are eagerly awaiting orders and are at your service.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Record of the Qingyun Lane House Demolition Case Trial <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Firefighters Witnessed the Event</p>
<p>To Testify in the Next Hearing</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM on the day before yesterday (Tuesday), the Criminal Court No. 2 of the Special District Court held a trial for the house demolition case in Qingyun Lane, North Sichuan Road. Judge Cheng Shangfeng presided. The plaintiff's representatives were lawyers Xue Jiaqi and Wang Zuxun, and the defendant's representatives were lawyers Ding Rong and Chen Zhongyin. In addition to the plaintiff and defendant, the witness Gu Wensheng (Gu, a member of the Second District Party Branch, testified on behalf of Xing Dingcheng, compradore of New Sassoon &amp; Co.) was summoned.

(Question) What day did you go again? (Answer) I don't remember if it was the day after or two days later, I just remember that I went again. (Question) Why do you only remember clearly the day of the Qingyun Lane house demolition on September 10th, and why don't you remember the others? (Answer) Because when I returned to New Sassoon &amp; Co. from Gu's place that day, people in the company told me that the houses in Qingyun Lane had been demolished, so I especially remember it clearly. (Question) When did you return to the company? (Answer) Eleven o'clock. (Question) Did you go to Gu Wensheng's place from the company, or from home? (Answer) From home. (Question) What day was the demolition of the house of the plaintiff, Miao She? (Answer) September 10th, at 10:00 AM. (Question) When did the White Russians disperse? (Answer) After being beaten, I went to get a medical examination and report to the police station, so I don't know. (Question) What time did you get back from the medical examination? (Answer) Because I was injured in the head, I was confused and didn't remember clearly when I got back. (Question) When you got back, had you eaten lunch yet? (Answer) I hadn't eaten lunch yet at that time. (Question) What time did the White Russians come to demolish the house on that day, Ye Chenglin? (Answer) A little after ten o'clock. (Question) Had it already struck ten o'clock? (Answer) I didn't pay attention to whether it had already struck. (Question) When did the White Russians disperse? After I was beaten, I went to the police station to report, so I don't know when they dispersed. (Question) Which police station did you go to report to, is it far away? (Answer) To the Hongkou Police Station, not very far. (Question) What time did you get back? (Answer) After eleven o'clock. At this point, Chen Zhongyin, the defendant's representative lawyer, spoke, saying that there was a supplementary statement to be submitted and requested the court to summon the manager of New Sassoon &amp; Co. Judge Cheng replied that the position of the manager of New Sassoon &amp; Co. did not need to be summoned. Lawyer Ding Rong continued, saying that the Fire Brigade had arrived at the scene that day, and two Fire Brigade members knew the situation at the time. I had asked the two firefighters, who said that they had witnessed two Western representatives from New Sassoon &amp; Co. leading the White Russians to demolish the house that morning. One was tall and one was short, and they were Westerners, not Chinese. There was also a Western policeman on the scene who was heard saying to the two Western representatives of New Sassoon &amp; Co. that the house could not be demolished. It was evident that the two firefighters were deeply aware of the situation that day, and requested the court to summon the two firefighters to court to inquire about everything, but the names of the two firefighters did not need to be announced, and I could submit a written record to the court, etc. Judge Cheng asked how he knew the firefighters were so detailed. Lawyer Ding Rong replied that he guessed the firefighters must have been at the scene that day, so he went to investigate and thus knew. At this point, the plaintiff's representative lawyer spoke, saying that on the day of the White Russian house demolition, there must have been disturbances, and the tenants would have blown whistles to report to the police. The Fire Brigade received the report and then sent a car. By the time the fire truck arrived, the White Russians might have already dispersed, so the testimony of the firefighters was unreliable. Lawyer Wang Zuxun continued, saying that on September 10th, whether the White Russian house demolition was a fact, whether Miao Shelai was beaten, whether Ye Chenglin was assaulted and had 20 yuan stolen was a fact, the court should pay attention to it. And whether it is legally permissible for a lawyer to find witnesses for the client. At this point, Judge Cheng announced that the hearing would be adjourned to next Tuesday, and the police station would be ordered to summon the patrolmen on duty that day and the two firefighters. Xing Dingcheng was still released on the original bail, and then the court adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e165">First Frost Seen This Morning <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Weather is Very Cold</p>
<p>Due to the cold air coming in continuously in recent days, the temperature has dropped significantly. As a result, the north has snowfall, and the city is suddenly very cold, as if it were winter. Yesterday's lowest temperature was 7.9 degrees Celsius, more than two degrees lower than the same period last year. Although the high pressure is still sending cold air to this port, it has not stopped. Therefore, there is no hope of warming up during the day. Due to the high pressure of cold air the day before yesterday, the first frost was seen this morning. If the high pressure can move eastward, there will be a hope of warming up during the day. However, because the cold air is coming too fast, the citizens have not had time to prepare cold-weather clothing, so the scene is very difficult.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Bandit's Wife Avenges Her Husband <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Investigating the Whereabouts of the Bandit Leader</p>
<p>Secretly Reporting to the Police Finally Leads to the Arrest</p>
<p>Qu Chengqing, a clerk at the Tianxiang Foreign Firm at No. 1 Guangdong Road, was kidnapped by bandits at around 11:00 PM on the 11th of this year after drinking with relatives and returning to the back door of his residence at No. 1760 Keneng Road, Haining Road. The bandits intended to extort a large sum of money. Subsequently, on March 18th, the Chinese and foreign detectives of the Huishan Police Station cracked the bandit's den, rescued the hostage Qu Chengqing, and arrested 14 bandits, including Zhang Zhangji and He Qing'en. They were sent to the court for questioning and sentenced. Zhang Zhangji was sentenced to death, He Qing'en to life imprisonment, and the rest were punished separately. However, during the court questioning, Shen A'di, one of the defendants, confessed that Bao Rongtang from Ningbo Tiantai (also known as Lao Er, also a member of the gang) was an accomplice. The court issued an arrest warrant, but it has not been caught for half a year. At around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, a woman named Zhang Chenshi, claiming to be the wife of the executed Zhang Zhangji, secretly reported to the Chief Inspector's Office of the General Police Station that Bao Rongtang was currently gathering and gambling with friends at No. 4, Lane 386, Gonghe Road, Zhabei. Therefore, Chief Inspector Lu Liankui, detectives Wang Cheng, Wu Changkai, female detective Zhao Shuyun, and Western detective Weilkaosi secretly went to the location, and together with detectives from the Zhabei Public Security Bureau, arrested Bao and brought him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Court No. 2 of the Special District Court. The police station's lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the facts of the case, requested that the case be postponed, and also stated that the informant Zhang Chenshi claimed to live at No. 414, Xinkang Lane, Yangshupu. Zhang Zhangji, who had been executed, was her husband, and the defendant Bao Lao Er was the leader of the kidnapping case. Her husband had been a carpenter, and Bao had invited him three times, claiming to go to "pahei lao" (meaning to rob opium). Her husband believed it was true and went with him. However, Bao changed his tune and kidnapped the plaintiff, hiding him at their place and using a gun to threaten her husband to be a guard. This led to the bandit's den being discovered, and he was sent to your court and sentenced to death, which has not yet been carried out. And Bao is still at large. Although she had searched everywhere, Bao's whereabouts were uncertain, until yesterday when she learned of Bao's location, so she reported to the police to arrest him, etc. When questioned, the defendant Bao Lao Er denied the charges, claiming that Zhang Chenshi was his mistress and that because her husband had committed a crime and been detained, she had repeatedly asked him for money and he had refused, leading to the false accusation. Zhang Chenshi then claimed that the defendant's statement was completely fabricated and that she was purely avenging her husband. If the court did not believe her, they could inquire at the Huishan Police Station about the six or seven people who had been arrested, all of whom were the defendant's apprentices, and the defendant also worshiped He Qing'en as his master. After verifying the confessions, Judge Wu Tingqi ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing to the 14th.</p>

<p>Pirates Kidnap People for Ransom as a Show of Force</p>
<p>5,000 Yuan Must be Sent Within Three Days</p>
<p>The previous reports had described that Fengli Town, outside Wusongkou, was occupied by pirates. It is now learned that the pirate gang, after being suppressed by the police, fled in their entirety. It is reported that at around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, a large gang of pirates returned, numbering over a thousand, which was even more rampant than before. There were more than 40 pirate ships, which were moored at various ports such as Yangbeigang and Shayuwa, and guarded a small area. The pirates landed with weapons, including hand-held machine guns, and occupied civilian houses along the coast, extorting food. Residents fled in droves. The previously kidnapped farmer, Sang Shoutai, was demanded a price of 15,000 yuan. The family had already collected 10,000 yuan and sent it. The pirates were still not satisfied and sent a letter to Sang's family, along with a bloody ear, to show their intent to receive a reply. They gave a deadline of three days to send the remaining 5,000 yuan, or they would tear up the ticket.</p>

<p>Repeatedly Solving Major Cases, Tragically Meeting an Untimely End</p>
<p>The Corpse's Wife Came to Shanghai Yesterday to Claim the Body</p>
<p>Sun Huanwen, a native of Songjiang, who was a detective of the First Squad of the First District of the Jiangsu Water Police and also an inspector of the Zhejiang Water Police, was assassinated in Baoyu Lane in the French Concession the night before last. It was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Sun captured Tai Bao Ashu's younger brother, nicknamed San Lao Ban, the leader of the Taihu bandits, in Shanghai last month and sent him to the Zhejiang government for interrogation. He confessed that the bandit gang was scattered in Shanghai. The superior sent Sun to Shanghai to arrest them. Sun knew that the bandit gang had many members and were very fierce, and it was difficult to arrest them. Therefore, he declared to the superior that he would sign a life-and-death contract. If he encountered an accident while arresting bandits, the government should generously compensate his family. With the permission of the superior, he brought his documents and colleagues to Shanghai a few days ago, staying in a hotel to investigate and arrest the bandits. The night before last, Sun and his colleagues and friends went to a friend's house upstairs at No. 10, Alley 1, Baoyu Lane, French Concession to meet and smoke. At 9:30 PM, they suddenly heard someone calling downstairs. Sun immediately went downstairs alone. When he reached the foot of the staircase, he was suddenly rushed out by the bandit gang, who fired several shots at Sun, hitting him four times in the groin, wrist, and other places. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled outwards in a crowd. At that time, Sun, still wounded, went upstairs. Later, his friends hired a car to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. When he entered the hospital, he could still speak. The hospital reported to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate the scene of the incident. At the same time, the doctor performed an operation to remove two bullets, applied medicine, and bandaged the wound. Unfortunately, the injuries were too severe, and the treatment was ineffective. He died soon after. The hospital notified the police station, who sent detectives to notify the Tongren Fuyuantang funeral home, who sent a coffin carrier to bring the body to the mortuary at 7:30 AM yesterday. At the same time, the friends of the deceased sent people to Songjiang to urge the corpse's wife, Gu, to bring her children to Shanghai to report to the police station. Then, the Criminal Section reported to the French Court's Judge Zhu at 2:00 PM to examine the corpse and take a statement, sat at the judge's seat to examine the</p>

<p>case. According to the Bao Detective's report of the case, after Mr. Zhu questioned the deceased's friend, Weng Yousong, as a witness, he ordered the police station to take photos of the corpse and allow the family to prepare a coffin and collect the body themselves, and to wait for the arrest of the murderer. The deceased was quite capable in his work before his death, repeatedly solving major cases and earning the praise of his superiors. Also, at that time, a certain woman surnamed Mou happened to be passing by the staircase, and the cape she was wearing was pierced by a stray bullet.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Aftermath of the Zhabei Military Clothing Factory Fire <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>A Total of Two Women Have Died So Far</p>
<p>The Perpetrator is Still in Custody</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, a fire broke out suddenly at the Rongchangxiang military uniform temporary workshop on Tiande Road, Hujia Muqiao, Zhabei. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspapers. The following is a continuation of the investigation:</p>
<p>The Loss is Relatively Small: The management of the factory has always been strict, and smoking is prohibited in the workshop. Unexpectedly, a worker, Mao Yongshi, violated the prohibition and secretly smoked, causing a major disaster. However, two days ago, the factory still had thousands of sets of various military uniforms that had just been completed, and there were more than 600 workers. By the night before last, everything had been completed, leaving only 300 workers and over 600 sets of military uniforms. Although it was unfortunate to suffer a disaster, fortunately it happened two days later, so the loss was only in the range of four to five thousand yuan. Also, because the reed shed fence had doors on all sides, the workers were able to escape in all directions during the incident, which was not as devastating as the loss of the Fuchang military uniform factory a few days ago. It was also a great stroke of luck in the misfortune.</p>
<p>Two Women Died Tragically: The female worker Qin Liu's tragic death was not because she could not escape, but because she fell outside the factory in the panic and was trampled to death, which is very pitiful. Yesterday morning, the family of the deceased requested the court to waive the examination, and the factory provided generous compensation, which the family of the deceased received to take care of the aftermath. Another person who was burned, Jiang Zhang, died in the hospital yesterday after being sent to Jisheng Hospital on Baoshan Road by the Zhabei Third Fire Brigade.

<p>Claiming to Fear False Accusations by Kidnappers</p>
<p>His Nerves Seem to Have Suffered a Major Stimulus</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM yesterday, a man over forty years old hailed a sampan No. 1004 at the Nanjing Road Wharf, saying he was going to Pudong. Unexpectedly, when the sampan reached the center of the river, the man suddenly jumped into the Huangpu River to commit suicide without saying a word. The sampan man struggled to rescue him. Before long, he jumped into the river again to commit suicide, but was still rescued. Because there was not much water, there was no danger to his life. The sampan man Xu Genfu sent him to the Water Police Station. First, Xu described the passenger's two attempts to throw himself into the river. When questioned, the man said his name was Yu Xinghai, 45 years old, from Henan, and lived in the home of Liu Yongfu, a detective, near the Hanqiao in Zhabei. Because the kidnapper Liu Renrong had a grudge against him, and Liu Renrong was arrested and prosecuted for committing a crime two months ago, he was afraid that he would be falsely accused, so he sought this short-sighted end. When asked where Liu Renrong had committed the crime and where he was being held, he replied that he did not know at all. When asked how many people were in his family, he replied only three, but he could not say who the three were. After a while, he muttered to himself, and his condition was like madness. The police chief, considering that his words were incoherent and his nerves seemed to have suffered a major stimulus, ordered Detective Wu Rongsheng to escort him to the District Court for disposal.</p>

<p>The Police Committee Will Discuss the Measures Today</p>
<p>The Damei Evening News reported that the Public Concession's Police Committee will meet tomorrow (the 6th) to discuss the dog racing problem within the Public Concession and the methods to prohibit it. According to reports, there are five members of the Police Committee: the chairman is the Englishman Blanc, and the remaining members are the Englishmen Shebad and the Japanese Fukushima, as well as the Chinese Yu Qiaqing and Chen Tingrui. Three of them have expressed opposition to dog racing, so it is expected that the meeting tomorrow will result in opposing dog racing and recommending prohibition to the board of directors. However, according to reliable sources, the Public Concession will also carefully consider the welfare of the shareholders of the two dog racing venues at the same time, so that their interests can still be fairly protected. Also, a reporter from the Damei Evening News visited the US prosecutor Sa Laide today and asked if American citizens go to dog racing venues or other public places to gamble in the future, whether a lawsuit can be filed. Sa did not express an opinion, but according to another source, American criminal cases in China have always been handled according to the laws of the Columbia District, so gambling is not a crime, and opening a gambling venue constitutes a criminal offense. However, in the future, it may not be impossible to use the laws of other states to prosecute gamblers.</p>

<p>Reduced to Three Months' Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhou Xunlin and his wife Chen Yinbao had a minor quarrel, and Zhou reported to the police station, initially suing for injuring his son Jishun. Later, because Jishun died, he went on to sue for causing death by injury. The first instance sentenced Chen Yinbao to three years and six months in prison for abandonment.

<p>Sentenced to Three Months' Imprisonment and Fined 400 Yuan</p>
<p>Li Yuankang, a shareholder of the Japanese Hongfu Tobacco Company on Qipu Road and a native of Ningbo, colluded with his fellow villager Yu Bingyang, who had already been punished, on October 16th at around 8:00 PM to mix and sell counterfeit cigarettes, disguised as the Qimei brand cigarettes produced by the Chinese Xinglong Tobacco Company on North Henan Road, in two boxes, totaling 100,000 cigarettes, to the Tongqing Cigarette Paper Shop on Tongyun Street in the French Concession. He fled after the incident. Delong Tobacco Company offered a reward of 200 yuan in the newspaper for his arrest. The day before yesterday at noon, detectives Liu Junjie and Western Detective Clark of the Hongkou Police Station learned that Li Yuankang was sipping tea in the Leyuan Tea Shop at No. 2, Ximen Road in the French Concession. They then secretly went to the address with detectives from the French Police Station and arrested Li and brought him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The police station's lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the facts of the case and said that the defendant was indeed the principal offender, and requested severe punishment. When questioned, the defendant confessed that the counterfeit brand cigarettes were sold to him by Zhang A'de, who was on the run, saying that they were goods confiscated by the tax bureau, but he did not know the truth. The rest of his confession was evasive. The representative of Delong Tobacco Company, lawyer Huang Yuping, stated that the goods confiscated by the tax bureau did not have stamps and were stamped with the tax bureau's seal. The defendant was an expert in cigarettes, so how could he not know? Therefore, he requested the court's attention. After the court hearing, Judge Feng Shide sentenced Li Yuankang to three months' imprisonment and a fine of 400 yuan for selling cigarettes with counterfeit trademarks. If the fine was converted to imprisonment, two yuan would be deducted for each day. The number of days of pre-trial detention were converted to one day of imprisonment for every two days.</p>

<p>Police Force Scrambles in Vain</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organization established this pauper asylum behind the Second Prison in Caohejing. The number of inmates has reached over 450. Under the meticulous planning and reorganization by Director Wu Tang, it has achieved considerable success. Due to a riot that occurred in the asylum in August last year, an alarm bell was installed at that time, connected to the Sixth District, Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, and the Caohejing District Security Corps, so that in the event of an accident, they could be immediately notified to suppress it. Unexpectedly, the other day, the asylum needed to add an alarm bell in the dining hall. An electrical worker accidentally cut the wrong wire, causing the alarm bell to be triggered, ringing non-stop for a while. Forty or fifty people from the Public Security Bureau's police brigade and the Security Corps, all fully armed, rushed to the asylum. The neighbors were shocked and did not know what to do. After learning that no incident had occurred, they all regrouped and left. Afterwards, Director Wu went to various agencies to explain and apologize, and sent letters to the Public Security Bureau and the Security Corps, thanking them for their courage in their duties.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the Fourth Patrol Team of the Wusong Public Security Bureau received a tip-off that two notorious bandits from Jiangbei were hiding inside the Jinlitai, a three-masted Chaohu sand barge moored at Dongpubin. The team immediately dispatched Patrol Leader Wang Songshan, along with patrolmen Wang Xingqi, Xiao Jiasheng, Zhu Shukuai, and others, all fully armed, to board the ship. They captured the two bandits, Guan Biaolin and Huang Tian. They also found two new large leather suitcases and a rattan basket belonging to the bandits, containing a large number of silk fabric clothes. Patrol Leader Wang brought the bandits to the team headquarters. After a brief interrogation by Team Leader Bai, due to the involvement of notorious bandits, police were dispatched to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation. The Jinlitai sand barge and its crew were detained pending orders for investigation. According to the reporter, Wang Weizhong, from Guanyun County, Jiangbei, the two bandits have been bandits since 1927. On June 17, 1928, Guan Biaolin led dozens of bandits into Wang Weizhong's home, intending to rob and kill. Wang cleverly hid and was unharmed. The bandits killed Wang's steward, Wang Dafu, and kidnapped Cai Hengshan, leaving no remains. The situation was very cruel. Wang Dafu's son sued the Guanyun County government, ordering a wanted notice. They were later arrested in Yangkou, Shuyang, and handed over to Guanyun County by the Xiangshuikou Joint Defense Association. Due to the bandits' cunning confessions, it was difficult to make a judgment. On the seventh day of the first lunar month of this year, the bandits escaped from prison, taking away 43 other important criminals. The Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs have issued wanted notices. After their escape, the bandits hid in places like Sanjiaozhen and Lvsi, specializing in kidnapping and robbery. Later, they joined Ma Yuren's forces and served in the rear army. After Ma Yuren failed in Yancheng, the bandits hid in Shanghai, intending to return to Jiangbei to become bandits again. Unexpectedly, the long arm of the law caught them when they were spotted and arrested.</p>

<p>Shen Xingtao, the owner of Shen Xingji, located at 1270 Lafayette Road in the French Concession, and a native of Pudong, previously contracted to build several houses at the intersection of Qipu Road and Rehe Road.

Han delayed payment for this amount, only giving Shen Xiang 250 yuan. Shen hired lawyer Yan Luqing to sue Han in the Special District Court. Han also sued Shen in the French Mixed Court for cutting corners and using inferior materials. Yesterday morning, the Special Court summoned Shen for the case of Shen suing Han. Lawyer Yan requested that the court first rule on whether the court should accept the case, stating that the French Mixed Court was not a legally recognized court by the Chinese government and could not accept the case. The presiding judge, Zhou Daren, believed that the defendant's residence and the building's foundation were both in the Public Concession and should be accepted by the court, so he proceeded with the trial. The plaintiff stated that he had not received a penny for the additional work, except for the 250 yuan. The defendant's lawyer stated that payment had already been made and presented a receipt as evidence. Judge Zhou believed that proceeding with the case would be detrimental to both parties and suggested settling out of court. He adjourned the case for a later hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Retrospect and Prospect of the Chinese Child Welfare Association (Continued) by Wu Weide <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of our association, we have been fortunate to receive the support of virtuous and talented individuals in the country, who are willing to sacrifice their time, energy, and money, and contribute their knowledge, talents, and experience to serve our association. This is something we deeply admire and are extremely grateful for. Although they do not need our admiration and gratitude, those who are now willing to fulfill their obligations and serve on various committees of our association include: Executive Committee members Minister Kong Yongzhi, Luo Yunyan, Mrs. Guo Bingwen, Mr. Gao Fengchi, Mr. Li Daonan, Professor Chen Heqin, Ms. Ding Shujing, Judge Hu Yigu, Dr. Yu Rizhang, Dr. Cheng Jingyi, Mrs. Liu Zhanen, Mrs. Fu Bulan, Dr. Hu Xuanming, Dr. Niu Huisheng, Dr. Le Lingsheng, Dr. Fei Peide, and Dr. Kuang Fuzhuo. Others include Mr. Zhu Chengzhang, Mr. Fei Wusheng, Mr. Huang Jingwan, Mr. Niu Huiling, Mrs. Guo Biao, Diao Defu, Mrs. Anderson, Mrs. Guo Shun, Ms. Zhang Zhenduo, Dr. Fu Wenshou, Dr. Shi Meiyu, Dr. Huang Bingji, Dr. Wang Shuzhen, Ms. Yin Cuihe, Mr. Fu Ruoyu, Dr. Wang Zonghai, Dr. Fan Dingjiu, Mr. Feng Zikai, Dr. Sun Keji, Mrs. Wu Weide, Ms. Guan Cuizhen, Dr. Lin Yutang, Mr. Powell, and Ms. Li Guanfang. They all have extremely busy jobs and extremely heavy workloads, yet they are willing to take time out of their precious free time to serve our association. This is truly commendable and naturally admirable. If not for their enthusiasm for promoting the happiness of children, how could they achieve this? As the saying goes, "Who can surpass me in loving goodness?" I think there will be many in the country who will rise up in response to this call.</p>
<p>Exerting a bit of effort yields a bit of results. We only fear that we do not strive now, how can we expect success in the future? When we look at the past, our hearts are filled with a myriad of thoughts. On the one hand, in addition to considerable satisfaction, we are even more self-motivated. On the other hand, in addition to constantly admonishing ourselves, we also feel the necessity of expanding our organization, increasing our strength, and uniting more comrades to strive forward with us for the child welfare movement. With the calls and efforts of a few people, we have managed to achieve today's insignificant results. If we can gather the backbone of the entire country, stand on the same battle line, and work together for the goal of child welfare, then wouldn't the achievements that may be manifested in the future be even more brilliant and splendid? Wouldn't the happiness of Chinese children be even more fulfilling and complete? Wouldn't the strength of the Chinese nation be even more robust and increased? Wouldn't the foundation of the Chinese nation be even more solid and stable? As the saying goes, "Many hands make light work" and "United we stand." These are truly unbreakable famous sayings. The meaning of our enthusiastic solicitation of members this time lies in this.</p>
<p>The child welfare movement is a movement to plant a permanent plan for our nation, a movement to seek fundamental construction for our country. Since we are part of the Chinese nation and have a considerable responsibility for the construction of the Chinese nation, then in the face of this great movement, how can we stand idly by like Qin Yueren, who saw the leanness and fatness of others without telling them? We should bravely and resolutely join in cooperation to promote its success. Dr. Wang Zhengting said it well: "The happiness of children is the foundation of the happiness of the people of the whole country. The work of the Chinese Child Welfare Association is something that all Chinese people should enthusiastically support and vigorously assist." I hope my compatriots will repeatedly reflect on these words. "The future is long" and "the responsibility is heavy." The cause of child welfare is by no means comparable to trivial matters. The purpose of our association is to seek happiness for the children of the entire China. If any child is still mired in the sea of suffering, still struggling in adversity and displacement, then it shows that the responsibility of our association has not ended and the work of our association has not been completed and we still need to continue our efforts. We have no time to rest, how can we slightly harbor the thought of leisure? Friends, this cold reality is too far from our ideals. We should build solid camps and fight to the death, stand on the same battle line, and strive forward together! Promote the happiness of children and complete the child welfare movement. Gentlemen with aspirations, why don't you rise up and come?</p>

<p>Esteemed Mr. Editor,</p>
<p>I have read your esteemed newspaper's report about the accidental mistake of Hui Luo Company, which stated that Xin Yi Construction Company used a platform as a workshop, with a small platform more than ten feet high built in the center to place a pot for boiling asphalt. This does not correspond to the facts. Our company is responsible for the asphalt project and has never built a high platform. Moreover, the place where the pot is placed is the lowest part of the star surface, and our workers have not yet started work. How could there be a source of fire? I am afraid that the error will be transmitted by mistake. Here are the real circumstances. I hope that you will correct it so that all parties will know the truth. I am deeply grateful. I wish you good health.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e197">Tidbits from the Political Scene <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— UB</p>
<p>Anyone with a slight knowledge of the capital knows of Cao the cook. Cao was the chef of former Premier Tan Zukong's household for generations. Throughout his life, Mr. Tan abstained from the temptations of pleasure, women, and wealth. However, he had a fondness for rich and fresh delicacies, and would not enjoy his meals unless they were prepared by Cao. Guests who wanted to feast with Mr. Tan would first hire Cao to prepare a shark fin banquet, typically rewarding him with one hundred and fifty gold pieces. Therefore, there were few important figures in the political scene who did not know Cao the cook.</p>
<p>Mr. Tan would always bring Cao the cook with him whenever he traveled to Shanghai. One evening, Major He planned to take the night train from Shanghai to Nanjing back to Beijing. When he arrived at the station, it was already late. He asked a station clerk and learned that the berths were sold out. Only in the adjutant's compartment of Premier Tan, there was still a way to arrange a berth. Thinking that it was the adjutant of Premier Tan, maybe he was familiar with him, so He hurried on the train. When he opened the door, he was shocked to see it was Cao the cook.</p>
<p>The Tan family had strict rules, and Cao the cook also acted prudently and adhered to the rules. Throughout Mr. Tan's life, Cao the cook never dared to overstep the boundaries. It can be seen that a famous figure of a generation has his own true nature. After Mr. Tan's death, Cao mourned him with a couplet: "Serving and pleasing, I remember those years. When the young master walked in the courtyard, I also shared the joys and hardships. Governing the country and cooking are not easy tasks. Now that the master is gone, who understands the heart of harmonizing the cauldron?"</p>
<p>After Mr. Tan's death, the mourning couplets and sacrificial banners presented by various sectors were dazzling and beautiful. There were still undiscovered treasures from overseas that were not hung out that day. The upper inscription read "Old Brother Zu'an, May You Rest in Peace," and the lower inscription boldly read "From Your Brother Wu Peifu." The couplet read: "The road to Shu is difficult, and the apes of the Wu Gorge weep with lines of tears. Changsha mourns, and the wild geese of Hengyang carry several letters." The feelings are evident in the words, and Wu Peifu is the most heartbroken person today.</p>
<h3 id="e198">A Hundred-Year-Old Brandy in the Family <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qingduo</p>
<p>"How can I obtain Zhongshan's thousand-day wine, and become intoxicated until the time of peace?" This is a poem by Wang Zhong of the Song Dynasty. In recent years, wars have been frequent, and we today have this thought. The first line is suitable for us to chant. In the poems of the past, there were many who chanted about wine, and there were many who were good drinkers. It can be seen that pure mellow wine is favored by many refined scholars and poets. Therefore, I will occasionally write about wine. Wine is best when it is old. Those who are good at drinking or those who love antiquity often have precious collections. Mr. Chen Huanzhi, a wealthy businessman in Shanghai, likes to play with antiques. He has several bottles of brandy in his family, made in France. The year of manufacture was 1830 AD. Mr. Chen has been collecting it for seventy years. This year is 1930 AD. The wine has been around for a hundred years. It can be called old. The aroma is refreshing and unusual. Mr. Chen cherishes it like a treasure and keeps it carefully. Recently, because there were friends who were good drinkers, he took out two bottles of this fine wine and gave them to his friends. The recipients were as if they had obtained a rare treasure, and they used it to entertain distinguished guests, who all appreciated it. For a time, it was spread as a good story.</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Great Decisive Battle of Yan Feng's Final Days <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ya</p>
<p>Since Yan Feng unleashed their troops and the central government issued an order to suppress them, they have been stalemated on the Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan lines for almost five or six months. Finally, the Battle of Xinzheng led to the collapse of Yan Feng. Although it can be said that the situations of obedience and rebellion were different, the spirit of the central generals who bravely advanced was enough to chill the enemy's courage and prevent them from being willing to fight. The great decisive battle of Yan Feng's final days will be recorded on the left, which will be appreciated by those who remained for this war.</p>
<p>The Situation Before the Decisive Battle: In late September, the Central Army, through its efforts, broke through the stalemate that had lasted for months. On the Longhai Line, they defeated the enemy west of Neihuang and Suixian. On the Pinghan Line, they defeated the enemy at Linying and Xuchang. After these disastrous defeats, Yan Feng concentrated their main forces on the Longhai Line near Kaifeng and Chenliu, and their main forces on the Pinghan Line near Changge and Xinzheng. They shortened the front line and connected the two routes, hoping to wait for work at leisure and make a final struggle.</p>
<p>The Six Divisions Marched Day and Night: At that time, the Central Army formed more than ten columns, taking advantage of the victory to drive straight to Zhengzhou and Luoyang, in order to cut off the enemy's retreat. The Sixth Division then followed up and pursued after defeating the main enemy forces near Suixian, and went straight to Qixian County. It was then incorporated into the Ninth Column, and together with the Ninth Division and the Fifty-third Division, turned to advance on the Pinghan Road. After passing through Tongxu, Fugou, Weishi, Yanling, and several other counties, they marched day and night, lightly armed and quickly. After seven days and nights, they gathered between Changge and Weichuan. The enemy had fortified defenses at every turn, and the fortifications were particularly strong. The Ninth Column, having been ordered to advance towards Zhengzhou, ventured in three routes, encountering enemy encirclements along the way, so as not to leak the news. Finally, on October 1, they seized the Xueji and Xuedian stations between Xinzheng and Zhengzhou. While removing the railway and telegraph wires to cut off transportation, the Sixth Division divided the 18th Brigade Chen Shiji's unit to cooperate with friendly forces to guard the north, and the main force of the 18th Brigade and the entire 17th Brigade turned south to attack the enemy's back. Fan Songfu approached Xinzheng on October 3.</p>
<p>Feng's Army Was Surrounded on All Sides: After October 2, the Central Army, sharpening their spirits, joined forces to attack fiercely. The enemy, such as Zhang Weixi, Zhao Fenglin, Ni Yusheng, Tian Jinkai, Wang Hemin, Feng Zhi'an, Deng Baoshan, Ren Yingqi and other units, no less than hundreds of thousands of people, were surrounded separately by the Central Army, so that they could not take care of each other and became turtles in a jar one by one. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered countless casualties. Then Zhang Weixi sent an envoy to request a ceasefire, and was willing to send a telegram listing Feng Yuxiang's crimes and begging the central government to reorganize them. Zhao Guantao, the commander of the Sixth Division, believed that time should not be lost and the enemy should not be let go, and urgently asked Commander-in-Chief Chiang to thoroughly resolve the situation to avoid future troubles. At that time, Commander Gu, who commanded the siege of various divisions, also saw through his treachery. He replied to the envoy, "Hand over your guns before you open your mouth." The envoy left without understanding. Zhang Weixi, unable to do anything, convened a military conference. Just as they were sobbing and at a loss, large bombs from the Central Air Force planes were dropped one after another. For a time, all the participants fled in panic. In addition to the Ninth Column, the Central Army in this battle included the Eleventh, Sixtieth, Sixty-first, Second, Third, and Twenty-third Divisions.</p>
<p>Feng's Army Collapsed Completely: The enemy near Xinzheng had been surrounded separately by the Central Army, and the 18th Brigade Chen Shiji's unit of the Sixth Division surrounded Ni Yusheng's infantry brigade and Zhang Weixi's artillery regiment. Later, due to lack of food and reinforcements, they were willing to surrender unconditionally. More than 3,000 rifles, more than 30 artillery pieces, more than 400 mules and horses, and more than 4,000 officers and soldiers were all confiscated by the Sixth Division. The enemy army was greatly shocked, which led to the complete collapse on October 6. More than 20 senior military officers, including Zhang Weixi, were taken prisoner. Later, according to Commander-in-Chief Chiang's telegram, their lives were preserved and they were employed at discretion to give them a chance to reform. Middle and lower-level officers were sent to schools for training, and soldiers were sent back to their hometowns. The Yellow River and Luo River area was cleared.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Gleanings from the Second Anniversary of the Ministry of Railways <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Guqu Zhoulang</p>
<p>The Second Anniversary of the Ministry of Railways was held on November 1. There are two notable events that have not been seen in the newspapers.</p>
<p>1.  The final magic trick. A person took the stage alone, holding an empty blanket. In an instant, he conjured up a large number of pre-mounted congratulatory couplets, as many as six or seven pairs, all with excellent writing. Unfortunately, the text was too long to remember. He conjured up a brocade banner of more than ten feet long, with the five golden characters "Complete 100,000 Miles" attached. The upper and lower inscriptions were complete, as a congratulation to the Ministry from all the staff. However, this section was not announced in advance, so the guests did not wait to watch it, which is a pity. The instructor claimed that the magician was "Wang Yang Dahai" (Vast Ocean), which was neither a name nor a nickname, which made people feel puzzled.</p>
<p>2.  The enchanting dance and the decoration of the lounge, dazzling. Red men and green women, hugging each other in gorgeous costumes, dancing to the melodious music. It is indeed soul-stirring. Other performances, such as the new drama using Yang Sou, Zhang's wife, and the magistrate, and the hanging ghost, were the most wonderful. All seven old dramas were commendable, especially Tian Ba's Worshiping the Mountain was unique.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Eulogy to Mr. Tian of Qichun (Part 2) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Loudong Feng Chao</p>
<p>Alas, when the People's Party was first established, it drove out the Manchus. Heroes from all directions, like rain and clouds, with articles and integrity, as beautiful as the sun and stars, achieved the success of the Xinhai Revolution. However, after the conquest of the wind, the customs of scholars became ambiguous, and those who upheld integrity either suffered wrongful executions, were imprisoned, fled to foreign lands, or buried themselves in desolate mountains. Therefore, Zifang had the tour of Chisong, and Shaobo had the boating on the Five Lakes. The world was turbid, floating in the dust, without gaining filth. Although poor, they did not regret it. When their hearts were depressed, they expressed it in articles, like Qu Yuan's "Li Sao" and Wen Shan's "Song of Righteousness," which were all works of talented people expressing their anger, enough to be immortalized in the future. As for you, sir, your late years were especially strong. Knowing that the world could not tolerate you, you wrote the Great Peace Plan, forming your own school of thought. Your arguments were like Jia Sheng's memorial on politics, and your literary talent was like Dong Zhongshu's response to the virtuous and talented. You melted the codes and systems of ancient and modern times, based on Sun Yat-sen's principles, and extracted the legal ideas of Europe and America, establishing a century-long plan and leaving a guideline for thousands of years. If Mr. Sun were here, he would not change these words. You once said to me, Chao, "What I have written, this is the most important. Sitting and talking about it can be put into practice. It is not the opinion of a scholar." Alas, your words are still in my ears. How can I not be sad? In ancient times, there were famous works written by fathers and narrated by sons, such as Zichang, Meng Jian, and Silian. Clearly displayed in the past, from now on, the unfinished business will be entrusted to Cui Ji to continue well. Chao is young and has no special expertise, but you alone thought he was teachable. As the saying goes, "To have one confidant is enough." If I had met you ten years ago, I could have followed you and served the Party and the country. Now I see you in your illness, unable to listen to your teachings, and you are gone. Thinking of you in the wind, the sorrow cannot be supported. Alas, woe is me, our lord, as incorruptible as Xu You, as detached as Zhuang Guang, as resolute as Tian Heng, as loyal as Wu Mu, as benevolent as Mo Di, as grand as Chen Liang. Your life should have been as long as that of Fenyang. Why did you abandon our Republic of China and pass away when you were over fifty, with your writings unfinished and your policies not implemented? People in the past have said, "Born to be a hero, die to be a spirit." May your spirit be as beautiful as the sun and moon, may your principles be glorious, shining as the stars, displaying the constitution, fighting as thunder, striking the jackals, stern as frost, encouraging our talented people, transforming into rain, nourishing all directions, turning into wind and clouds, awing all directions. It is your dead body, but your heroic spirit will be passed on forever. Alas, there is no greater sorrow than the death of a national scholar, and no greater pain than the loss of a confidant. The water of the Yangtze River flows forever. When will the sorrow in my heart end? Remembering your life, I write my sorrow and entanglement. May you appreciate my sincerity and come to receive it. Alas, woe is me.</p>
<p>Attached are the mourning couplets of Feng Ping (Xinxia) and Feng Xu Jingcun (Suhua):</p>
<p>Broad and profound, you are a great scholar; heroic and fierce, you are a great knight. Striving for revolution, you are a founding hero; your good policies are written too much, and you should cast a model for all time.</p>
<p>Your wisdom and strategy were in Hanyang; your righteousness and courage were on the Huai River. Your surprising victories were on the Yangtze River. Your famous name will last forever. I am ashamed to have no capable pen to record Tian Heng.</p>
<p>Mourning couplets of Feng Fei (Jinan) and Feng Jiao (Jiaoyue):</p>
<p>On the establishment of the capital, on the equalization of land use, on the governance of the Yellow River, matters concerning the national economy and the people's livelihood, you consulted ancient and modern times to create your own strategies.</p>
<p>You were a founding hero, a literary master, and a scholar. Now you have fallen and the trees have withered, weeping for the country and mourning for this person.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Warmth in the Heart (309) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Tears Shed in All Directions, Red Love Sorrowful; Hearts Captivated in One Place, Green Meaning Lingering</p>
<p>For those who die suddenly of lung disease, there are two crucial points: twenty years old and thirty years old. The twenty-year-old mark is the most dangerous. Young people who get lung disease are often sixteen or seventeen, eighteen or nineteen. Their lungs are most tender and easily eroded. At the age of twenty, whether male or female, they are the objects of great hope from their parents, and they themselves have many good youths. They are just thinking of diligently studying and gradually reaching adulthood, but suddenly they die young. This is the most painful and regrettable thing. However, those who get lung disease during the developmental period often cannot escape this mark. Once this mark is passed, they must escape the second mark of thirty years old. This can be considered the next danger. During that period, there is also the issue of sexual desire, which often promotes the disease and makes it worse. If they can escape this mark, the danger will be greatly reduced. Therefore, there are often many people who, in their thirties, look like they will never live to be forty years old. But by their forties, they are still the same old consumptive ghost. By their fifties, they are still an often sickly old man. This is like a carrying pole. As the weight of age is added, you only see the pole bending, but it won't break for a while. Unfortunately, Liu Xingshu could not escape the second mark of thirty years old. When consumptive disease reached the point of being bedridden, people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang call it "consumptive disease in bed." When they are not in bed, they occasionally have attacks, but when they are not sick, they can still walk freely. Once they are in bed, it's over. The most distressing thing is that there is no way to save them. The doctor has already shaken his head and refused. The family members no longer hope that he will be reborn. Everyone knows he is going to die. They just hide it from the patient himself, telling him comforting words. This is even harder than announcing a death sentence. You must know that prisoners who are sentenced to death still have hope of being pardoned before the execution, and they still have hope of having their cases overturned. But where can this death sentence on the sick body go to find the master of nature to beg for leniency and ask him to postpone it for a moment? But how can people endure this time of waiting for death? Zuo Shichen had visited Liu Xingshu several times during his illness. The first time was when he was vomiting the most severely and had no strength to speak. Zuo Shichen didn't dare to talk to him much and left in a few minutes. The second time, he heard that the dangerous period had passed, and he desperately wanted a friend to talk to him. When he went to see him at that time, his body was so thin in the quilt that it was as flat as the body. When he stretched out his hand, it was like a bird's claw. When he saw Zuo Shichen, he cried miserably and said, "Old friend, I may not be able to see you again." Zuo Shichen could only comfort him and say that he could gradually get better in the future. He also thought that the dangerous period had passed. Probably patients often comfort themselves. In fact, the disease had already penetrated the bone marrow.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Financial and Gold Market Progress in an Orderly Manner <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's afternoon market closed due to the autumn races. The gold market's gains from the morning are now being given up.</p>
<p>Over seven taels traded with fluctuations in the half-day session yesterday. The Gold Exchange only operated for half a day in the morning on the third day of the autumn races on the 5th. The bidding price suddenly turned to a high peak, and the trend was agile and progressed in an orderly manner. The foreign exchange also had a tight image, with the listed prices unchanged, but banks slightly increased their intake. The market demand exceeded supply. Companies such as Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, and Yong Tai Xing all had purchases. The sellers were mostly retail investors. The early market was peaceful, the overseas silver market was mediocre, and although silver bars rose, the US silver market was closed. However, the intentions of the peers turned higher, because the buyers were very strong and there was a shortage of bars. Then, it soared upwards, suddenly breaking through the 80 tael mark, with a sharp increase of more than five taels. During that time, it only rose and fell by one tael, and finally reached beyond 82 taels. It was really a reversal after repeated declines. However, there were more than seven taels of fluctuations in the autumn race, which is difficult to figure out.</p>
<p>Higher than the previous morning by 5 taels and 3 qian. The December market opened at 8:30, immediately adding 3 qian, to 577 taels and 3 qian. Large silver bars continued to rise by 1/16. The price of silver was closed due to the American holiday (the gross market was around 7 taels). Later, because Yuan Cheng Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Tai Kang Run, Yuan Mao Yong, etc. all had follow-up purchases, it immediately rose by more than one tael, becoming 78 taels and a half. Before long, it suppressed a little over two qian, to 77 taels and 7 or 8 qian. It was sold by retail investors. However, the transactions of Xianling, etc. were very few. Only Sumitomo bought one tael and two qian, five fen, nine li, three hao, seven si, five hu of Dalian silver. Almost at 9 o'clock, HSBC posted all the exchange rates, with no changes. At that time, it was around 78 taels. The market situation seemed to progress afterwards, with an increase of more than one tael. Da De Cheng and hedge funds had already purchased, but there were often fluctuations of four or five qian. After 10 o'clock, it improved further, rising rapidly. Xianling, etc. also saw profits. Zhengjin Wang You bought twelve months of pairing with one and a half, and in January, the bank paired with one and a half. Once the price was the same, it could be absorbed, and the price of gold had jumped to beyond 79 taels. At 11 o'clock, it had broken through 80 taels. Yong Heng, Yuan Heng, Zhi Feng, Yong Tai Kang Run, Tai Xing, etc. were eager to buy, and people's hearts were extremely firm. No matter how the sellers looked, it suddenly surged up two taels. However, there were fluctuations of six or seven qian in half an hour. When it closed at 11:30, it reached 82 taels and 3 qian, which was 5 taels and 3 qian higher than the previous morning. Later, Zhi Feng Yong, etc. entered again, raising it to around 2 taels and a half. Then it suppressed a little five or six qian. The maximum price in the half-day session was 82 taels and 3 qian, and the minimum price was 77 taels and 2 qian, with a difference of 5 taels and 1 qian. The closing price of goods was 82 taels, and the opening price was still 615 taels, with a difference of 37 taels to 33 taels. The recorded prices were 91 taels for November, 82 taels for December, and 91 taels for water replenishment.</p>
<p>More incoming accounts and less outgoing pressure. According to same-industry transaction counts, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, Tai Kang Run, Tai Xing, Yong Heng, Fu Yu, Yu Da, Zhi Feng Yong, Shun Li, Wan Xing, etc. all had large intakes. Da De Cheng, Yuan Tai, Tian Xiang, Tai Feng Cheng, etc. had occasional inflows and outflows. Yuan Cheng, Heng Xing, Yi Feng Yong, and retail investors all had sales. Hedgers had slight purchases. The Dalian gang bought more than 800 bars and sold 300 bars. The Guangdong gang sold hundreds of bars.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Various Exchange Rates Show Tightness <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market was quite flat, and the exchange rates also did not change. Only large silver bars rose slightly. The Yokohama and Kobe markets also had no good or bad. The HSBC listed prices for each exchange rate were the same as the previous day. However, during the autumn racing season, only half-day market conditions were available in the morning, and the domestic market was slightly tighter after initially being flat. It was probably because the gold market rebounded to a high level and had already escaped the 580 tael mark. Large households were competing to buy, and people's hearts turned high, which has already triggered a rise of 5 taels. As a result, the pound exchange rate was reduced by .0625 compared to the previous afternoon, the US exchange rate was reduced by .125, and the Japanese gold was increased by .0625. Chinese gold companies such as Heng Xing Shengda, etc. had thrown out 50,000 to 60,000 pounds of British gold to hedge back bars. Banks such as Sumitomo Zhengjin, etc. slightly purchased. Also, British and Japanese banks mutually traded tens of thousands of pounds. It is said that the Japanese merchants' appetite is not weak. In addition, US and Japanese banks traded some US dollars. As for Japanese gold, there were slight inflows and outflows. The Dalian gang sold several hundred thousand yuan of Dalian silver, and the industry slightly settled. On the bank side, only Sumitomo had some trading. The market atmosphere was calm.</p>
<p>The pound exchange rate in the domestic market seemed firm, with only .0625 of flexibility. The opening price for November was one shilling, seven pence, four and three-eighths of a cent, and the buying price was seven and a half pence. December was similar. The opening price for January was seven and a half pence, and the buying price was five and five-eighths of a cent. At the noon closing, the prices for November and December were seven pence and three and three-eighths of a cent, and the buying price was four and three-eighths of a cent. The opening price for January was four and three-eighths of a cent, and the buying price was seven and a half pence.</p>
<p>The US exchange rate in the domestic market had an increase or decrease of .125. The morning prices for November and December were 39 yuan and three-eighths, and the buying price was 39 yuan. The morning prices for January were 39 yuan and a half, and the buying price was 39 yuan and five-eighths. The noon closing prices for November and December were 39 yuan and three-sixteenths, and the buying price was 39 yuan and seven-sixteenths. The morning prices for January were 39 yuan and seven-sixteenths, and the buying price was 39 yuan and eleven-sixteenths.</p>
<p>The East exchange rate in the domestic market had a half-point review from morning to noon. The morning prices for November were approximately one tael, two qian, six fen, two li, and a half. The prices for December were five fen and three-quarters, and the prices for January were five and a half fen. The buying prices were reduced by three li and three-quarters or half a fen, depending on the position. At the noon closing, the prices for November were one tael, two qian, six fen, and three-quarters, and the buying price was six fen and a quarter. The prices for December were one tael, two qian, six fen, and a quarter, and the prices for January were one tael, two qian, and six fen, and the buying price was one tael, two qian, and five and a half fen. Today (the 6th), the autumn races have ended, and the market will be open all day as usual.</p>

<p>Yesterday, according to a London telegram, large silver bars continued to lengthen. The recent lengthening was .0625, to sixteen pence and five-eighths (equivalent to one shilling, seven pence, and seven-eighths of British gold). The far-term also lengthened by .0625, to sixteen pence and three-quarters. China's spot price advanced and then retreated, with few transactions. The market was quiet. After the closing, the market was idle because Citibank was closed. Also, the US silver price and the US exchange rate against British and Japanese currencies were closed for the American holiday. The British exchange rate against the US currency decreased by .09375, to four yuan, eight jiao, and five fen and five-eighths. The British exchange rate against the Japanese currency increased by .03125, to two shillings and five-sixteenths. The British exchange rate against Shanghai remained unchanged at one shilling, seven pence, and three-quarters. There was no telegram from Mumbai.

<p>Yesterday, banks closed in the afternoon for the autumn races, so it was impossible to investigate the various settlement messages. However, it was heard that after the silver call rate rose the day before, it was very loose again yesterday. The silver call rate was 1 qian and 8 fen in the morning market, and suddenly fell in the afternoon market, with only 6 fen. The initial interest added to the head was 5 fen, and finally it was free.

<h3 id="e207">Securities The Bond Market Remains Calm <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The 1919 Customs Revenue Suddenly Rose Sharply, Other Bonds Slightly Strengthened</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai securities market, the spot transactions of various government bonds were still scarce. Only 19,000 yuan was transacted throughout the day. The futures market was as flat as before. Both buyers and sellers were still quite calm. It is estimated that the transaction volume in the morning market was more than 3.3 million yuan, and in the afternoon market, it was more than 3.7 million yuan, totaling about 7.1 million yuan. The 1919 Customs Revenue was actively traded, with a transaction volume of more than 3.7 million yuan. Troop disbandment bonds were only 1.1 million yuan, and the 1896 public bonds were more than 700,000 yuan. Other bonds were very thinly traded. As for the price changes of various bonds yesterday, although the trading of the 1919 Customs Revenue was still active, investment in them was particularly active, so the price rose step by step, and the momentum was quite strong. Futures rose by 1.4 yuan compared to the previous day, and spot prices continued to rise by 1.78 yuan. The 1896 public bonds also performed well, rising by 0.56 yuan. Other bonds were also slightly firm, but the momentum was very stable, with most rising by only 0.1 or 0.2 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Yarn and Cloth The Yarn Market Is Difficult to Reverse <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The Current Month's Yarn Spot Reaches a New Low</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is increasingly sluggish. The appetite of various groups is weak, actual sales are disappointing, and the support from overseas markets is minimal. This situation has led to a difficult-to-reverse situation, and a new low price of 145 taels has been seen. The reporter has repeatedly mentioned this situation before. The only hope for the yarn market lies in actual sales and foreign markets. Now that the war is over, there is still no hope for prosperous sales. It is the season for a cold winter market, and the trend of overseas markets is generally sluggish. The protection of buyers has been lost, and there are already those who are gradually selling off. The atmosphere of weakness has enveloped the entire market, and the call for 42 or 43 taels is again prevalent. If there is no active development in actual sales, and the overseas market situation remains weak, it is not an exaggeration. However, the excessive weakness of the market is enough to attract the attention of those in need and stabilize it accordingly. However, this is not the time for a vigorous atmosphere.</p>
<p>Human Bids See 45 Taels The trading floor's human bid market is very soft, with the decline in the current month being particularly severe. Each month falls by four or five cents. The market atmosphere remains weak in the afternoon, with the next month continuing to fall by three to seven cents. However, the current month fell by one tael, reaching a new low of 145 taels. The total transaction volume is 19,850 bales.</p>
<p>November 145.0 Lower than 143.3 7,002 Bales February 147.9 Lower than 832,150 Bales</p>
<p>December 145.9 1239,200 Bales March 149.0 718,950 Bales</p>
<p>January 146.9 929,650 Bales April 149.2 10 2200 Bales</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Are Increasingly Thin Spot yarn transactions in the market are becoming increasingly thin. The appetite of various groups is weakening. The total transaction volume is 582 bales. Fujian group bought 32 bales, Yunnan group bought 36 bales, Jiangxi group bought 90 bales, Jinan group bought 30 bales, Inland group bought 128 bales, Nanjing group bought 5 bales, Sichuan group bought 185 bales, Guangdong group bought 10 bales, Xiamen group bought 10 bales, Wuhu group bought 5 bales, Xuzhou group bought 10 bales, Tianjin group bought 20 bales, Ningbo group bought 5 bales, and Anqing group bought 15 bales. The market price fell by about 0.05 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Cotton Market Sluggish <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is sluggish due to the weakness of the yarn market, with new low prices appearing frequently, and actual sales are completely stagnant. The market atmosphere is desolate and lifeless, and the market situation is deteriorating. Manufacturers have a relatively large inventory and are less concerned, and imported cotton is continuously arriving. According to reports, Shanghai imported 27,678 bales of Indian cotton in September and 2,431 bales of American cotton. In November, 40,590 bales of Indian cotton and 31,560 bales of American cotton were imported. The comparison between September and October shows a rapid increase. Based on past situations, it is feared that the number of imports will increase even more in the future. The huge amount of foreign cotton imported is enough to put pressure on Chinese cotton. One reason is that the harvest is relatively poor, and they are unwilling to sell at low prices. Another reason is that inland transportation is blocked, transportation is inconvenient, and the market supply is scarce. Foreign cotton is repeatedly depreciated and sold, resulting in a huge amount of absorption. Given the sluggish appearance of the yarn market, and its tendency to further decline, it will be difficult to expect active transactions in the near future. The trend of foreign cotton is also unable to provide assistance. However, the calmness of the inland groups may temporarily lead to a fluctuating and sluggish situation.</p>
<p>The Cotton Market Follows the Yarn Market Exchange Han Standard, with Indian and English cotton falling, and the yarn market also declining. Bulls are gradually liquidating their positions, and the market atmosphere is very weak. However, the Han groups remain stable, with each month falling by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. The market continued to decline in the afternoon, with each month continuing to fall by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume is 40,900 piculs.</p>

<p>Few rice boats arrived at Zhabei yesterday via Xiang Road, only about ten in total. The new Japonica rice continued to rise by two or three jiao due to brisk sales. Top-quality rice has reached 15 yuan outside the customs, and ordinary rice is all around 14.5 yuan. Medium-quality Japonica rice needs to be raised by three or four jiao, and transactions are very active. Bo Dao rice also reached 15 yuan, and the buying interest was very strong. Yang Xian rice rose sharply by half a yuan, and customer appetite was quite good, reaching as high as 12.7 yuan. Du Jian rice arrived sparsely and sold quickly, rising by about 0.4 yuan, opening at a high of 13.2 yuan. Bu Jian rice and Ke Jian rice were slightly tight by one or two jiao because retail sales were flat. The variable yuan market was extremely active, and the appetite for buying steamed rice was especially greedy, with good prices of three or four jiao, opening especially high at the 16 yuan mark. The stock of Yin Yuan rice was drying up, and the market also rose accordingly, trading at a high of 15.3 yuan. The rise in various grades was very fierce throughout the day. This was mostly due to the impact of the rising production reports.</p>
<p>Yesterday, only about ten boats arrived at the river in Shanghai South. Sales in this street turned brisk, and Chang Bang's new Japonica rice tended to rise. High-quality goods were evaluated and raised according to the market, needing to reach 14.4 or 5 yuan. Because the market atmosphere of Su Tong and other Japonica rice was active, cargo merchants sold, causing the price to rise by 0.3 yuan, making the increase in high-quality wholesale prices more than sufficient. Qing Ding Songjiang Sijing Kiln seeds and other Bo Dao and Bai Dao rice in Nanlu also shouted higher due to the rising trend in the northern market, needing to be good by two jiao for large plates, opening outside at 14.6 yuan. Yang Xian rice was tight by two jiao, with top-quality goods at the 12 yuan mark. Du Xian rice also rose by 0.15 yuan, with top-quality rice at 12.5 yuan. The rise in Xian rice prices here was flatter than in Shanghai North. The Bai Yuan market was quiet, with few transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Flour Market Mills Dump and Soften <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market prices for various months were only slightly lower by about 0.2 yuan due to foreign imports. Because the competition between the long and short sides was very fierce, both inside and outside the industry could not help but wait and see, so transactions were very thin. At times, there was a slight uptick. Until the opening of the market in the afternoon, it was initially stable. Then, Fuxin and small and medium-sized mills continued to release large amounts of near and distant contracts, causing the entire market sentiment to be shaken. The prices for various months fell like a leaf swept away by a strong wind. The reason for this dumping is that the mills may have no hope for future actual sales, so they are dumping all their holdings, intending to go short. According to general predictions, a price of 1.5 yuan is already within sight, without any doubt. If the mills continue to dump, it would not be surprising if the price fell to 1 yuan. As a result, the current month fell by 0.2 fen compared to the previous day, December fell by 0.0325 yuan, January fell by 0.03 yuan, February fell by 0.0275 yuan, March fell by 0.035 yuan, and April fell by 0.0325 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Wheat Market Starts Weak, Ends Strong <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market showed a pattern of initial weakness followed by firmness in the morning and afternoon. Initially, the market sentiment was still flat because foreign wheat was still only slightly lower by two or three jiao. Then, large short-selling accounts urgently covered their positions, so even though the flour market fell sharply and foreign wheat recovered slightly, the market atmosphere turned profitable. However, since the environment has not changed and the flour market continues to fall sharply, it is feared that the future will still be a decline. As a result, the current month was better by 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day, December was better by 0.1 yuan, January was unchanged, February and March were better by 0.1 yuan, and April was better by 0.4 yuan. The spot wheat market was still quiet throughout the city. Large factories still mutually excluded each other and did not trade. Only 500 bags of Yaowan wheat were opened at 4.3 yuan, and were purchased by Shen Da.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Ke Xian Rice Has Purchases on This Street <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Ke Xian rice market, in addition to the Fujian group continuing to load and handle, this street also began to purchase. The source of supply was still small, and the inventory was not large. Therefore, the market situation immediately became tense. Jiangxi Ji Zao Gao rice opened again to 11 yuan, and medium-quality grades also rose, rising by 0.3 to 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day's market price. If this street continues to purchase in the future, the Fuzhou and Xiamen groups will not be able to press down prices as they did in the past, and the market can gradually turn around. The total transaction volume was 2,000 bags of Jiangxi Ji Zao rice, priced at 11 yuan, 11.078 yuan, and the next grade at 10.03 yuan. In addition, 250 bags of Zhong Guan Ji Wan rice were priced at 11.59 yuan, and 2 small carts of Nanjing Ji rice were priced at 9.45 to 9.2 yuan, which also saw an increase compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Dried Goods Production of Honey Dates Decreases <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Market Prices Tighten Daily</p>
<p>The current stock of honey dates is scarce, and market prices are tightening daily. This year's output is less than last year, and those in the area who engage in this business are all cautious. Most of them suffered losses last year, and more than half of them have stopped this year. Therefore, the goods currently shipped to Shanghai will not be loaded again until 60-70% of them have been sold, fearing that they will repeat the same mistakes. Due to this reason, the stock of goods is decreasing daily, and market prices are able to remain firm and trend higher. Recently, the buying appetite of the Guangdong group has been better, followed by this street, which is also considerable. Top-quality Hui Gong Chao Dan is sold for 31-32 taels, Hui Gong Tu Tu for 28 taels, and Lanxi Tu Tu for 24 taels. Upper and lower grades are added or reduced as usual.</p>

<p>According to Min news, the output of new Lu bamboo shoots is quite large. However, due to bandit disturbances in that area, local unrest has led to delays in the arrival of goods. The arrival of goods has recently increased, and sales areas everywhere are mostly shipping out after listening to prices. However, because the National Lunar New Year is approaching, the pricing of various industries has already been opened. It is faintly heard that the industry considers the price too high, and the stock in the production area is quite large, so the intention to import is very weak. Customers still want to raise prices, resulting in not much arrival of goods daily. Compared with the spring market, it has already risen by two or three taels. Please refer to the price list for the prices of various varieties.</p>

<p>There have been no new arrivals of Sichuan pickled mustard tuber recently. The current stock in the market is about 3,000, and it is gradually being released. The price of the top grade is 35 yuan, and the price of the next grade is one or two yuan less, which is looser than before. In terms of sales, although North Road, the inland, and this street are buying, the quantities are not smooth. The market price yesterday was 34 yuan for the top grade and 31-32 yuan for the ordinary grade. The market situation was flat.</p>

<p>Spot Sugar Market May Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market production area telegrams stated that Cuban spot sugar and New York sugar futures had not arrived on the market. The price of Javanese spot sugar was 8.375, and the price of November and December futures was 8.125. Compared with the previous telegram, there was no increase or decrease. The Association market划盘 (hua pan) Dutch sugar No. 20, the buying interest in raw sugar white was depressed, and the export was quite large. The transaction price was 7 taels and 8.5 qian. The newly arrived goods that could not be exported were 7 taels and 8 qian, and the import and export were very slack. Milled fine sugar white was 7 taels and 9 qian, No. 20 medium sugar white was 6 taels and 9 qian, and inquiries were also few. No. 8 Dutch red was 6 taels and 3.5 qian, and the market was firmer. Transactions in Japanese sugar were also very sparse, and the market also declined. N mark was 7 taels and 7.5 qian, J mark was 8 taels and 0.075 qian, YRO mark was 7 taels and 3.25 qian, YT mark was 7 taels and 6.5 qian, and YR mark was 7 taels and 9.25 qian, which was a decline of 0.025 to 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day.

Dumping Dutch sugar raw sugar white also turned cheaper, and the discounted price was 5.95 yuan in Dutch currency. The industry's intention to import was weak, so it was also being delivered for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Metals Transactions Are Slack During the Autumn Races <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Metal transactions have been slack in the past few days due to the Autumn Races. Because foreign firms only trade for half a day, buying and selling is exceptionally quiet. The standards for each item are unchanged because imports and exports are fresh, so there is no rise or fall. However, it is heard that among the new iron products, such as new foreign yuan, foreign plates, and triangular iron, the overseas pricing is trending weaker, so there are signs of relaxation.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Exports of Native Nails Are Very Active <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Exports of native nails have been very active recently. There have been large-scale exports to Tianjin, Hankou, and other areas in recent days, and groups from Fujian, Shantou, and other places have also come to negotiate recently. Therefore, the number of nail exports yesterday was more than a thousand barrels. However, the market price has not changed.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Hui Si Iron Raises by 0.025 Yuan <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Transactions of Hui Si iron have recently shown the vigor of spring grass after rain. Can factories, tobacco companies, and lard factories have all placed orders, so more than 2,000 boxes have been sold in the past two days. However, since the market goods have been purchased, they have become very scarce. Therefore, market prices are rising steadily. Yesterday, the price rose by another 0.025 yuan. The old steel mill is estimated at 22.5 taels, the new steel mill at 21.5 taels, and the Mitsui goods at 19.5 taels. It is heard that export groups are also buying up goods these days, so the market prospects are very promising, and there may be no goods arriving within the year. Because of this, people's hearts are firmer and the standard is more stable. According to recent daily sales of more than a thousand bundles, it is feared that there will be a shortage of goods within the year. Therefore, those with abundant funds are taking advantage of the opportunity to absorb goods to prevent unexpected events in the future. Therefore, recent transactions feel more lively.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Silk and Tea Sales of Sichuan and Hanzhong Silk Waste Slightly Increase to France <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Since autumn, sales of Sichuan and Hanzhong silk waste to Europe have been sluggish for a long time. Stocks in Shanghai are increasing daily, and prices are weakening. Recently, winter silk fabrics have been launched overseas, and silk weaving factories are preparing to start weaving for spring. Demand is gradually rising. Shanghai French firms have been receiving inquiries from Paris, Marseille, Lyon, and other places in recent days. The Sichuan and Hanzhong silk waste market will invite Chinese merchants to negotiate today during the Autumn Races. However, it is heard that the overseas prices of Xi'an Wan Shou silk and Sichuan scarves are still trending weaker.</p>
<h3 id="e223">The Silk Market in Foreign Firms Is Declining <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Wednesday, the third day of the Autumn Races. Foreign firms only worked in the morning. The number of overseas silk telegrams to Shanghai was sparse. Silk factories were all closed, and manufacturers were increasingly negative. The market atmosphere was stagnant. Yesterday, only Samsung imported 8 bales of Bai Gan silk, and Xiang Ji imported 10 bales of cotton Zhou Bai silk. Prices were all firm.</p>
<h3 id="e224">The Tea Market During the Autumn Races <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai foreign firms was still quiet. Foreign firms only have half a day of market hours during the Autumn Races, and the Russian Association for Assistance has always maintained an attitude of not buying unless prices are low and is very picky. Therefore, there were no large transactions of Zhen Mei Gong Xi green tea and Qimen black tea in the market yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Piece Goods Chinese and Foreign Goods Are Trending Weak <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>The cloth market in this factory is gradually turning soft, especially fine cloth and fine twill, which are showing a persistent downward trend. The reason is that the market has been gradually rising since the beginning of spring and has never fallen back. At the beginning of last month, the opening prices were already at their highest point, so once actual sales were quiet, people's hearts were extremely weak. Fine cloth was the first to fall, and fine twill has been falling steadily in recent days. Yesterday, Yang He fell again, selling for 6 taels and 9.25 qian. Lan Shuang Yu was 6 taels and 7.5 qian. The rising trend of coarse cloth has also stopped. Hubei Tian Zi has been arriving in Shanghai successively, and 13-pound Shuang Ying spots have also increased. However, coarse twill is still firm, which is because the number of goods shipped is not large.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Piece Goods East goods have been falling steadily in recent days. Yesterday, Zhong Hua Rong has slightly turned around, and there are not many goods priced at 1.9 qian. Black Hua Rong must be priced at 1.925 qian. The falling trend of printed velvet has not stopped, and most have fallen to 1.9 qian. Zhong Shan Ni, after a period of stockout, has arrived yesterday. Jiao Ye Ti Shu is 2.8 qian, and Yin Pao Che is 3.9 qian. This street has added purchases. Gui Jiao Bi Ji and fine Bi Ji have gradually arrived in Shanghai, so the trend is not as firm as before. Xia Shen Zhi Gong Ni has also arrived in 40-50 pieces, and Jing An Si Ma Gu Xi Shou are both opening at 2.9 qian. Since the numbers at Xiao Dong Men once searched for Cai Tiao Rong, it has risen yesterday, and most are opening outside at 6.5 taels.</p>

<h3 id="e249">Fudan Social Science Department Bi-monthly <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Thing</p>
<p>Since Mr. Ying Chengyi took over the Department of Sociology at Fudan University, the spirit within the department has been excellent, due to the work of teachers and students and the contact between alumni. Recently, the department has published a bi-monthly publication, which is very exciting in terms of content, and the price is very low. It is published on the 5th and 20th of each month. The writing is a collaboration between teachers and students.</p>
<p>After the first issue was published, I have read it slightly, and I feel that they have two indelible spirits, that is, equal emphasis on both academic theory and practical application. Therefore, I will make a brief introduction in this column. I think that the readers who love social sciences will also abandon hearing about it.</p>
<p>There are three articles in total. The first is "What is Truth" by Mr. Ying Chengyi, head of the department. The second is "Dynamic Social View" by Mr. Wang Zaiqin, an alumnus. The third is "Research on Allied Strikes" by Mr. Chen Peisen, an alumnus. The following is a brief description of each:</p>
<p>The article "What is Truth" is divided into four aspects for discussion. The first is "The Starting Point of Truth." The second is "The Aspect of Truth." The third is "The Complexity of Truth." The fourth is "The Ultimate of Truth." The author first determines the two elements of things and me, because human actions are based on the interaction of these two elements, which is the starting point of the production of truth. When talking about the first paragraph of "Basic Starting Point," it says, "I am the one who determines things, so when I mention myself, the meaning of things is already included in it, but I am the aspect of its expression, and things are the aspect of its connotation. Things are also the ones who determine me, so when I mention things, the meaning of me is already included in it, but things are the aspect of its expression, and I am the aspect of its connotation..." And it uses Tang poetry as an example. The second paragraph roughly says, "When people have awareness of me, they lose awareness of things. When they have awareness of things, they lose awareness of the standard." The third paragraph says that in a complex environment, human beings are not governed by me, but by things, and not governed by things, but by me. These two principles are adjusted to each other, and a kind of relationship is produced. From this relationship, I can recognize me, and from this relationship, I can recognize things. This relationship has two methods, namely natural relationship and artificial relationship, and it also explains that the relationship between me, things, and things and me are mutually conditional. The second aspect is "The Aspect of Truth" which is divided into three paragraphs for discussion, namely "The Truth of Me," which measures all things with me as the standard, "The Truth of Things," which measures many me with things as the standard, and there are many beautiful examples in it, which are omitted. The third paragraph is the truth of the relationship between me and things." The original text says, "The relationship transcends me, there is awareness of the relationship, it does not follow things, nor does it adhere to itself, and it regards things and me as one..." And it uses the relationship between husband and wife as an example. The third aspect is "The Complexity of Truth," believing that the relationship between things, me, and things and me is the three aspects of truth, not absolute truth, but embracing these three aspects and synthesizing them into one. This comprehensive nature can also assume three nouns to represent them, namely, the first cause, the second cause, and the third cause. The author says, "The third cause is the relationship between me and things. The invisible of things is the first cause, and the visible of things is the second cause..." And it uses the European War as an example. The political situation and the psychological situation are all invisible, and they are the first cause. The conflict between Austria and Serbia is visible, and it is the second cause. Therefore, the first cause is inevitable, and the second cause is probable. The third cause is also called the final cause, because "Things are born of me, and I am the final cause. I am born of things, and things are the final cause." Admitting these three causes is a cycle of reciprocity and continuous flow. This is the whole of truth. It is also the origin of religious truth, scientific truth, and philosophical truth. The author says, "...Looking at the three kinds of truth together, what is said is actually one truth. Looking at the three kinds of truth separately, they are three kinds of truth. The inability to define it in one word is not due to the inability of human learning, but to the limitation of human skills. Truth is dynamic, but language is static, and thought is static, so it is no wonder that religious scholars and scientists insist on their own opinions," The fourth aspect is about "The Ultimate of Truth," summarizing the whole article and saying that truth transcends everything, and because it transcends everything, everything is not truth, because truth is dynamic and can never be expressed in language, thought, or symbols.</p>
<p>The second article is "Dynamic Social View," which is divided into seven major sections. ㈠ The introduction describes three methods of observing society, namely, observing society from the universe, observing society from the individual, observing society from the society, and their criticisms. ㈡ Using science to observe the dynamics of the universe, and using the structure of celestial bodies to prove that the universe is moving. ㈢ Using science to observe the dynamics of matter, and using the atoms and electrons of matter organization to prove that the surface of static matter is also moving. ㈣ Observing the combined society from the dynamic universe, and proving the local movement of society from the entire movement of the universe. ㈤ The law of change of social phenomena, admitting that the movement of society is carried out according to Hegel's "dialectics". ㈥ is the theory of revolution in the process of social progress. A sudden change will occur in the dynamic process of society. This sudden change is commonly called revolution. It is completely a natural trend that cannot be stopped or created.</p>
<p>The third article is "Research on Allied Strikes". Because this article has not yet been completed, it will be introduced after it is completed.</p>
<p>Announcement The second issue of the bi-monthly publication will be published soon. The content includes articles by Mr. Xiao Yuan and Mr. Zhang Hongchou, an alumnus.</p>
