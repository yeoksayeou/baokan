<p>時評</p>
<h3>英倫舉行印度圓桌會議</h3>
<p>印度圓桌會議已在倫敦開幕矣英君親致訓詞政府方面懷抱樂觀與政府無關係之政客對於大會之成功不能無疑問而在印度之印度敎徒則因倫敦圓桌會議開幕之故停止工作一日藉以誌哀從此三方面以觀其感想各有不同在此以成功爲滿意者在彼方且以之爲辱更安論其不能成功哉</p>
<p>世界侵略者與被侵略者之間其意想之不同奚啻天壤被侵略者方欲恢復其人類固有之原則而侵略者則狃於以前侵略之歷史以爲稍稍退還以前之侵略即屬大恩而特惠而在被侵略者視之根本不改變仍爲侵略者朝三暮四之愚人之術耳故其結果祗有益增紛擾而無調和之望也此次印度之圓桌會議多半由此心理而產生其結果亦必仍遵此心理而歸束耳</p>
<p>不但英國之於印度他日凡有殖民地之國家大抵因此心理之推演其進行當與今日英國與印度間之情形不相上下也</p>

<h3>印度圓桌會議</h3>
<p>昨日正式開幕英皇致歡迎辭</p>
<p>重要虚席耐人尋味憲法問題意見分歧</p>
<p>印敎徒輟業誌哀</p>
<p>國民社十二日倫敦電印度圓桌會議於今日下午一時在英上院皇家廳舉行開幕禮由英皇致歡迎詞謂朕曾數次召集左右臣僚會議但從未會合英政治家與印度代表共同討論印度將來之治體自朕上次發出意旨後對於印度政府之方法頗多新頴之見解及主張發生此所以不得不重將印度之情形重行作一度之考慮此項會議之重要及大不列顚國之以後運命全賴在座諸君之協力殊無容朕再事聲明朕今日對於各大不列顚國各子邦自治政府之主張尤欲表示誠摯之歡迎對印度臣民之前途朕尙刻不去心祗須其要求爲正當不論爲多數抑爲少數均當予以考慮强者弱者富者貧者城鄉人民任何種族任何宗敎任何政治黨派朕均一視同仁毫無愛憎出於其間解决現時之局勢亦在能使彼此讓步以和衷共濟深望在座諸君能造成此良好之現象則靑史留名將永傳不朽云英皇辭畢當由印度五族院院長嗎哈拉茄氏起立致答辭首致謝英皇之歡迎温諭及頓請英首相麥克唐入居主席然後向會衆發言謂今日列座諸公均深覺其任務重大握產生新時代之機紐至印度則已達至憲法變遷之重要時期云云</p>
<p>路透社十一日倫敦電印度圓桌會議明日在上院正式開幕其第一次全體大會定十一月十七日舉行與會代表共八十六人計英屬印度代表五十七人印度王公代表十六人英國會代表十三人已開預會多次作非正式之討論政府方面對於大會景象懷抱樂觀因預會精神甚佳也惟與政府無關之政客則對於大會之成功不無疑問且有人謂印度國民大會即甘地黨代表之缺席爲大會失敗之徵英屬印度之代表數日來曾努力欲協定可給予回敎徒及其他少數民族之地位俾易於考慮印度將來憲法之形式但此種努力今猶未見有明顯的結果也一般代表似皆料印度各省及中央之自治將由此大會而產生惟手續問題則主張不一印度敎徒一派以爲英政府在開會之始即應向大會聲明此會目的在爲印度編製海外自治領土之憲法此派意見視印度國防少數民族地位王公諸邦地位等問題爲内務問題可聽自治的印度自行解决之而回敎徒等雖亦以海外自治領土之地位爲最後目的但以爲印度所有之特殊問題先當注意蓋以憲法必須擔保少數民族之權利也在此難題上各方意見顯然分歧而其他問題如印度應有聯邦憲法乎抑統一的憲法乎英屬印度應自訂其憲法乎抑照全凶度憲法辦理乎亦有暗潮王公之態度似可爲解决第二問題之助據現有趨勢察之如英國關係仍然保全而王公在其自己邦内之權利與地位不受妨礙則會衆似可贊成與英屬印度合作共同編製以聯邦憲法爲基礎之自治憲法也</p>
<p>路透社十二日喀拉基電印度敎徒因今日爲印度圓桌會議在倫敦開幕日特停止工作一日藉以誌哀各商店均閉門市塲均停市惟回敎徒與歐商則仍照常營業</p>

<p>國民社十二日柏林電德報對於今日在倫敦舉行之印度圓桌會議極加注意謂此會議非僅繫凶度之將來即關於大不列顚帝國亦殊爲重要云云至各報對此項會議之實際結果則均不甚表示樂觀柏林齊通報稱今日集議時有一席空虚有一人緘默此一人之緘默較全席之言論更爲露怠緘默者爲康黑虚席者爲印度席當各政客離開圓桌時雖互作誠摯之携手但該重要虚席則始終虚設殊耐人尋味也</p>

<h3>中公風潮中胡適王雲五到校勸復課</h3>
<p>馬君武由日返國</p>
<p>（國民通訊社）中公校長于右任於本月十日到校維持各節業誌昨報茲悉該校挽馬派所組織之代表團於昨日將各敎堂盡行封鎖及全體同學罷課事茲錄詳情如下</p>
<p>挽馬派形勢該校挽馬派分子多係兩廣學生推選代表組織代表團在第八敎室設立辦公處動用學生會費已達七百餘元並組織糾察隊張貼標語及散發傳單實行武力解决一般同學被其威脅大都敢怒而不敢言迎天派力與該代表團避免衝突然雙方互發傳單互貼標語亦曾發生數次混毆均被軍警排解未有重大損傷</p>
<p>張耀光被捕張耀光爲該代表團之首領羅隆基敎授最親信之學生當羅隆基被捕時曾親送上車旋知自己亦在被捕之列即避居滬上後因羅基隆保釋回校張亦隨同返淞積極工作不料於本年七月復由公安局第七區偵緝歸案即送往市公安局　押現尙未釋張耀光被捕原因係爲國家主義派在該校負責人負</p>
<p>迎于派形勢迎于派爲一般同學所同情惟因學校當局庇護挽馬派抑制迎于派故未能如挽馬派之公開活動實力亦不易確實調查但觀于先生到校維持時之形勢則知除挽馬派三四十人外餘均爲歡迎于先生者前以挽馬派之宣傳謂于先生决不來校校董會係以于先生爲過渡背後另有人在等語故事前均暫守沉默嗣觀于先生果肯到校維持空氣乃爲之一變現惟切望于先生於四中全學閉幕後速即返校正式就職耳</p>
<p>同盟會表示同盟會爲迎于派之一種組織此次歐迎于先生即爲該會所主動前晚特推派代表向于先生陳述意見于以即須出席四中全會表示閉幕後再行辦理現同盟會份子均暫持鎭靜聽候于先生回校後之處置云</p>
<p>全校忽罷課自于先生到校表示負責後全體學生均甚安心挽馬派見大勢已去圖謀最後之表示前日忽由王宏實（總務長）授鎖鑰於代表團戕各敎室盡行封鎖强迫學生罷課各敎授事前未知均挾皮包到校覩此情形又紛紛挾皮包而去</p>
<p>馬昨未到校馬君武於前日回滬業誌昨報該校代表團聞訊後星夜分數通告謂馬先生定於昨日上午十時到校令各同學於上午九時集集大操場整隊赴砲台灣車站迎迓忽接馬先生口頭通告謂海外初回人極困頓未能如期到校等語代表團即出緊急通告遣散云至下午四時許胡適之王雲五到校報告謂爾等須即上課校長事待校董會解决云</p>
<p>胡適之王雲五到校訓話另一消息馬君武抵滬後中公學生代表懇請回校主持馬氏本擬十二日下午四時到校旋因精神不佳未能到校託胡適之王雲五携親筆函到校訓學生復課靜待校董會解决　學生在校内外各處滿貼歡迎馬校長標語高懸歡迎旗幟於下午三時齊集大操場前往吳淞江邊馬路歡迎汽車抵江邊時全體學生燃砲鼓掌歡聲雷動胡王二氏下車後說明馬氏不到原因學生即請胡王二我到校訓話胡氏略云馬先生因精神不佳未能回校我代表馬先生向爾們道歉並以校董資格向爾們談幾句話馬先生有封信交我帶來勸爾們復課靜待校董會解决我的意思亦是如此爾們歡迎馬先生的熱烈表示我很喜歡我在做校長時從來没有受過學生這樣熱烈的歡迎我很食醋爾們迎馬先生的熱誠但同時我十二分歡喜因爲中國公學有了這麽一個能使我食醋的校長那是最好没有的了我定將爾們歡迎馬先生的熱誠告知各校董爾們要求馬先生復職的事我定帮忙爾們現但爾們罷課以待解决是損失太大了我以爲還是上課以待的好如上課以待還不能解决那時再想辦法未遲胡氏演說後當場徵求學生的意思學生大都主張罷課以待經胡氏一再勸告始肯暫時復課以待解决末由王雲五訓話大意與胡略同</p>
<p>馬君武致全體學生函中國公學全體同學公鑒昨抵滬承派人歡迎極感茲復承來函知同學盼君武即日來校君武亦極欲與諸君相見惟新近歸來一切問題尙待考慮此時未便說話但切望諸同學即日復課以免學業上受極大損失至於學校問題應靜候校董會解决深盼諸同學諒解此意也馬君武十二十一</p>

<p>機之外觀　此項福特飛機較之滬蓉航空所用者爲巨滬蓉機中僅可搭客七人而該機則多至十六人且尋常飛機但有發達機一具而福特則除中間一大機外左右尙各有一具此種設備不第速率可增且可不致因一機之損害而累及飛航機身全係金屬製造極堅精美觀之致葉子板長凡數尺機身並繪有宣傳圖案多種</p>
<p>飛前審察　飛行前一小時即有機師前來查察視内部機件是否完善經過此審查察以後更可安心無慮蓋如機件稍有疑問即停飛修理不貿然從事也</p>
<p>機繞塲一圈即御風而行矣</p>
<p>機中所見　機中府位甚爲寛敞計分二列列坐七人座皆爲靠背沙發異常舒適窗門緊閉然亦可向外閒眺俯視大地但見一片綠野長江如帶鐵道如墨線盤曲其他人物牲畜非目力所能及矣</p>
<p>分贈棉花　老于航空者于飛行時必携棉花蓋以高處氣壓較低由高下降如不以棉花塞入兩耳則因下界氣壓過高耳膜易受損傷是日鍾院長等未携此物於是由老於此道者當塲分贈衆視之不啻恩物然是日機飛甚低故即無此物亦無重大關係最趣者即行駛時機聲如雷雖同座者亦不能互相談話但以手作勢而已</p>
<p>大雨滂沱　抵京下降時大雨如注然人坐機上初不之覺下機後由該公司用汽車分送各會員至寓處招待甚爲週到取時計視之在途纔一小時又二十分耳以視火車即以特别快車論亦須八小時餘便利爲何如耶</p>
<p>如坐汽車　鍾先生並謂乘坐飛機其舒適一如汽車然汽車有時因道路不平而有顚動飛機則平穩無比且絶對安全將來此種事業必可有長足之進展蓋可斷言者也</p>
<p>空中之正　據福特公司招待者云福特氏本人旣爲汽車大王矣彼近更斥資數千萬以致力於航空使其子經營之其意蓋欲使其子作一空中之王所謂明德之後必有達人弓冶箕裘信可佩矣</p>
<p>京中盻望　京中人士報名欲試乘此機者已達數百人可見國人對此已感相當興趣惟該機必俟蔣主席來滬試乘飛京後方可供京人士嘗試要之此番福特之來影響於我國空運者實非淺鮮也</p>

<h3>歐游通訊（八十五）</h3>

<p>巡禮意大利日記</p>
<p>三羅馬十日八</p>
<p>第二日－鬥獸塲－君士坦丁帝凱旋門－加拉加拉共同沿塲－地下敎堂</p>
<p>看了君士坦丁帝凱旋門以後我就提議說</p>
<p>「出城吧先去看地下塋窟」</p>
<p>大家很同意於是就坐着馬車一直向亞比阿路Via　　ppioir走出迦比奈門Porto　Capina不多遠就是點綴着棕梠尖柏的大公園忽然靜悄悄不見車馬和人物從樹蔭中遠遠地望見七八個少年男女聚在綠茵上談話灰的方的烏黑的房屋一間也没有了馬在前面走像上山路左轉灣沿着土邱走上黃土的路灰土飛舞更顯出盛暑的逼壓熱眞熱熱得發昏不過考古的性情潛伏在胸底的我們只有古的神奇美的神奇奇詭的希望是無窮似的不多久馬車停在路旁土邱之上像峰房似的又紅又顯的一座廢墟像魔窟那樣沉寂我們竟就欣欣然走進去在穹窿之下在石柱上撫摩着荒凉的殘跡滿身充滿着慘淡的神異呵這是從紀元二一七年的遺跡加拉加拉的同共浴場Thermes　de　Garacalla.</p>
<p>奇怪眞奇怪在一千七百多年前羅馬出了一個古怪的國皇如其你願意加以好聽的字句他就是富有天才的創造的皇帝假使你要駡他他就是一個驕奢的暴君高興了他就造就這樣一個大建築眞不能知其所以然大家只好說這種博大的建築是爲因加拉加拉的非常識的驕奢而建起的這浴塲是大大極了的雖然只是那殘留的廢墟還能感到它整個的靈異從並列的環門的巧妙彫刻的石柱的遺跡還可以推想那可容一千六百人共浴的光景據說金屋的支配精密中央是浴室兩旁是運動室再次爲比賽塲還有藏書室餐室臥室屋深二百四十呎闊一百二十呎一個浴塲而有這樣的規模這種在平常人生中看爲不合理的繁褥華麗也可以做象徵羅馬的紀念</p>

<p>已市場買氣盛濃前市元茂永元興永大德成及物品等咸有爭購惟裕豐永泰康潤協裕順利等皆是賣出也自早間略見低勢殆因海外銀市徵跌而已往後買方旣湧良以掉期逼近補空者頗水乏人如物品套頭并投機者胥已追進且因中央政府試辦現金禁止出口限期六閱月迄今已届期矣故該業之心理逆料或可開禁爰是市價驟然冲出九十兩大關其間時有二三兩之起仆人心已見激昂迨後市大德成志豐永等仍向購買竟已出現掉期以來之新高價計達九十二兩復後賣者活動銳跌一二兩最後以在九十一兩之内惟外匯因逢週三停市至現貨赤條照期標約遞加八兩七錢五</p>

<p>滬南昨日各帮到二十餘號本街走勢不同常錫蘇同等白粳初因前日北市飛騰影響大都喊起奈銷胃不展市呈互擯但做開貨頗以買賣之手腕而定價有兩角之上落頂粳此間十五元一角許蘇帮高貨亦須十四元　左南路各早晚稻來貨亦續大勢自連跌之後貨客以成大關係均轉觀望故頂貨微堅中次轉定羊尖杜尖去路如客銷則緊店銷則穩情况行將向上午已提角左陰元到旺銷滯行情暫守原盤</p>
<h3>客秈厦帮擯守待小</h3>
<p>昨日客秈依然沉寂到頭雖零星小票絡繹抵埠而去化甚呆厦門福州等帮雖有胃口但以滬上米市看小亦趁勢擯守不辦以冀撳小市價後再行裝辦故昨市祗有本街應酬南京機秈四百包左右價十元Ｏ一角至Ｏ三角又湖南機元一百包價十三元八角云</p>
<h3>標粉近平遠疲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市開盤後各月份呈近平遠跌之象蓋洋麥報價又跌一元零而多頭方面轉　沉寂即大小廠家之空碼爲數已屬巨大如果因洋麥報小繼續出檔人心皇恐自必更甚市面之崩潰亦將愈烈所以近期交易旣少市勢平平遠期則以環境之故短去一分左右觀後步局面當看廠態如何方有消長也結果本月份及十二月份較小二厘半正月份未動二月份小五厘三月份小一分二厘半四月份小七厘半云</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白又見微落</h3>

<h3>南北貨蘭花子市價又漲</h3>
<p>到存均稀</p>
<p>蘭花子前日廣大太原兩輪由厦人口僅計四十一件據函息辦價已升至二十八九元而存底更缺故划申一時難和此批昨已見樣貨尙佳當即開出較高者價爲二十七兩次之二十六兩六錢比前升起五錢市象穩定</p>
<h3>絲茶歐美絲銷之進展難</h3>

<p>旣無法决定營業方針又如何進退雇用職員爲社會所注意之年關結賬問題現已由市商會議决擬請改以每年立春前一日爲總結束期呈請社會局轉呈政府核准備案惟政府是否能准如所請尙未可必日前市商會常務委員王延松氏在商會報告工商會議經過時曾述及工商部孔部長之意見以爲結賬與收賬不妨視爲兩個問題年底儘管結賬收賬自可隨商家之便至一月底或二月底皆無不可似此則於政令商情均無違背此事或將以工商部令行之云云但結賬與收賬究經是否可以分别爲二對於商界方面關係綦重茲據上海市商會秘書嚴諤聲表示其意見云我國商界舊習結賬雖分三期但端午與中秋關係尙輕最重要者爲年底俗語有「端午看一看中秋還一半」之說到年底則非淸結不可此所以有年關之稱也但商店中對於年底之結賬其重要關鍵不在内部之「結」而在外面之「收」必俟收賬淸楚後之結才算眞結如果年底只結不收在事實上必致發生以下兩種困難第一商店於年關收賬結束後股東方面始可以本年度實際營業結果决定本年方針是否擴充或繼續或停歇如果年關只結不收股東翻閱賬簿儘管看見有贏利若干而在實際上此項賬欵收賬時究竟有無倒賬爛賬或二折三折均在不可知之數則來年營業方針勢必無從决定譬如百業領袖之錢衆年關結賬而收欵須至一月或二月底則在結賬以後收賬以前此一段時間將如何營業正是一個大可研究之問題矣第二商店解雇或添雇大都以結賬後爲之在雇主方面旣可因來年營業方針决定雇用職員之增减在職員方面年底經手賬欵告一結束無論解雇轉業均可將手續料理淸楚如果年底僅能結賬不能收賬則一方面旣不能視營業槪况而决定增减職員另一方面欲解雇一職員如於年終結賬時行之乃其所經手之賬欵尙未能收取如於收賬後再行解雇則年關已過又非作一結束之時總之商界最重要者爲必須每年有一能切實結束之確定日期果年關僅可結内部之賬而不能收外而之賬只能「結」而不能「束」則在商業上必將感覺大不便且决爲不可通行者此層希望政府不能不注意及之云</p>

<h3>爲什麽愛迪生說今後敎育可用電影替代書籍（續）</h3>
<p>— 衛中博士講</p>
<p>Frank　Borzage有他的方法他導演The　River一片把全片分做三部頭兩部有音樂却用字幕代話演員的身體活動的安排法便是他們的身體活動達到發生說話的地步字幕才現出來明日我們可以查看我不知道這導演員有多少學問可是他導演的電影能夠合演員的身體的活動與字幕生關係好比生物學先有身體的活動然後有說話的活動無論什麽說話都是由身體的活動發生出來的在片裏可以看出、看Mary　Duncan比較看Charles　Farrll更容易看出</p>
<p>上面講的從電影來的經騐很可以帮助你們看說話是從身體來的那麽說話是從身體來的字是從那裏來的呢我們用科學來答覆如下字是從說話來的書没有别的就是寫出來的字簡單地說說話與字與書的關係可以呌做字是冰櫃裏的話書是冰櫃經過冷藏好了的字先有身體才有話有話才有字有字才有書没有有身體便没有話没有話便没有字没有字便没有書買書平常是偷東西可是做書的是有程度的人他先有身體綜合起來的活動才有書綜合起來的活動他講的話變成字才寫成書書是最末之一部他的話是他從頭到脚全體綜合起來所產的身體的最完全的表示是話身體活動的總合起來在腦那個身體在腦子總合起的活動的表示就是話没有腦也便没有話因爲人類有人類的腦所以人類有話動物的腦是不發達的所以牠的話是不完全的可是人的話是全體之中心點的表現全體綜合起來是腦子没有全體就没有腦子並且非全體是合在一塊的按科學說還是没有腦子</p>
<p>我們才用過我們的電影來說明話的來歷所以我們現在可以靠這經騐來說明以後的敎育對於書本有什麽眼光</p>
<p>非有我的經騐非有我的思想一定不可以用他人的經騐他人的思想用他人的經騐他人的思想來替代我的經騐我的思想這個就是打死了我自己的經騐打死了我自己的思想</p>
<p>總而言之電影在新敎育裏面是長久的外面的刺激電影合東西常常活動爲什麽我們明天看的電影叫做The　River因爲這是很活動的電影最活動的東西空氣以外就是水明天你們可以看看水從美國的高山流下來是多麽活動的東西啊</p>
<p>宗敎敎育給你們的是名詞科學敎育給你們的是刺激常常刺激你不許你磕睡不許你做菩薩電影打倒菩薩的人材打倒看不起身體的人材這就是電影最大的作用</p>
<p>試看中國的道學先生與外國的敎徒他們都以爲電影是外面的下等的東西他們自己以爲是高等人材就要書那些下等的人材才會要外面的刺激他們說「你去電影院我們置書去實爲要緊得多了」</p>
<p>實在電影是給科學的眼光相合的宗敎文化還未達到轉入科學文化的時候才在變化的時候電影很可以帮助我們練習去接受外面的刺激電影是故意的給人預備外面的刺激如果你是宗敎文化的書獃子你不會覺得出外面的刺激電影能夠使你覺得出外面的刺激使你不得不感覺出外來的刺激這樣使你的身體一步一步得到練習感受刺激的機會而漸會活動使你漸生新的腦子將來才有新的文化</p>
<p>我們宗敎文化的人不會找刺激電影可以帮助我們練習找去並且電影的刺激與人類的腦之復活比較容易發生帮助因爲電影刺激你的感官—與腦子最近而最有關係的感官（耳朶和眼睛）最接近腦子的感官先練習感受刺激以後鼻子嘴手足肚子和生殖器隨後練習如果耳朶和眼感官不活動鼻肺肚子手足生殖器等器官却活動是很危險的電影先給人的高等感官練習感受刺激是給人的全體練習受刺激的開始非全體練習接受外來的刺激宗敎文化是打倒不了的因爲科學文化是從外來的非腦子會感受外面的刺激不行全體不會接受刺激等於腦子不能夠感受刺激在這個地方我們今天的講演算完全了</p>
<p>盼望現在到這兒聽講的人明天去觀電影證明我剛才說過的利用電影以說明「身體與話的關係」的話不要先看電影的下等部分—男子脫衣到水裏—這下等的刺激是平常人不會到水裏現在先利用高等的激刺先看高等的部分以後才看下等的部分</p>

<h3>民立中學的壁報潮</h3>
<p>民立中學誰都知道是一老式的學校學生的思想和行動是有嚴格的限制在上星期鬧的壁報潮就足以證明一切</p>
<p>該校壁報首先發起的是「民立壁報」該報是以有興趣的生動的文字和新聞給回學調劑枯燥的學校生活的當然無踰越範圍之可言</p>
<p>不過該報出版之始即遭横禍這或許是問時出版的「壁虎」的帶累「壁虎所載各文係整個的對於學校漫駡式的批評會集當兩報揭出的一小時後同時給學校當局撕去了不過「民立壁報」是訓育處檢查過而蓋着核准公布的印章的呢</p>
<p>被撕之後便經過了全校許多敎職員的審查和誤解便得到了幾個結論</p>
<p>（一）壁報亦是學生運動之一學生運動是應當禁止的</p>
<p>（二壁虎及民立壁報人員均須查辦）</p>
<p>因辦壁報是主持學生運動</p>
<p>（三）民立壁報中有一篇題名「民族主義文藝與普羅文藝激戰的尖銳化」的短文因談（一）到普羅文藝而有共產嫌疑</p>
<p>不過事實是否即如他們所想的完全一樣呢這我想讀者們不難推想而得</p>
<p>試問復旦大學出版有十多張壁報是都犯了學生運動的禁例麽主辦者都該查辦麽還有更可笑的是共產嫌疑爲發揚民族主義文藝而提到普羅文藝就有共產嫌疑那麽「前鋒周報」「時代靑年」等刋物每期提起普羅文藝不是更有絶大的共產嫌疑麽</p>
<p>壁報潮的波浪至今還在一個個掀起不過主辦人都不敢持着明正的理論去辯誣（珂）</p>

<p>The Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was held at 9:00 a.m. on the eleventh. The opening situation and various news about the plenary session are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Central Party Headquarters</p>
<p>The main gate, the second gate, and the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters are decorated with pine and color archways, and the party and national flags are hung everywhere. The slogans in the auditorium are "Emulate the great personality of the Premier, who is kind, loving, noble, and pure" and "Continue the revolutionary spirit of sacrifice and struggle of the Premier." The inside and outside of the meeting place are guarded by armed police, and the order is well maintained.</p>

<h3>Hu Hanmin Delivered the Opening Speech</h3>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at nine o'clock. Chairman Hu Hanmin delivered an opening speech, stating briefly that the great task of suppressing the rebels has been completed. How to govern the country and build the country during the period of political tutelage is a fundamental issue related to the permanent foundation of the country and cannot be delayed. The important principles of political construction stipulated by the Third National Congress and the specific plans determined by the first, second, and third plenary sessions are very detailed. The people's expectations for the Party to implement them are also very urgent. However, looking back on the work of the past year or so, to what extent has it reached the plan decided by the Third Congress and the expectations of the people? It is necessary to check it. The opening of today's meeting coincides with the anniversary of the Premier's birth. This commemoration is even more significant than yesterday's European Peace Memorial. Although peace is advocated superficially after the European war, each country is still expanding its armaments. The so-called naval reduction conference and military reduction conference are all competing with each other, and the result has not seen a method to guarantee permanent peace. The Premier created the Republic of China and advocated the Three Principles of the People, hoping that all people will progress to Datong as the foundation of permanent peace. It can be said that the birth of the Premier is the birth of the savior of world peace, so the commemorative value can be said to be unique. Since the Third Plenary Session, the only obstacles to peaceful construction have been the ambitious warlords who have rebelled one after another. The central government can only suppress these warlords to save the country and cannot simply compromise with temporary false peace, which would leave the seeds of trouble for the country. This time, the armed comrades in the front have spared no effort to sacrifice their lives for the survival of the Party and the country. Although the anti-rebel cause has fortunately been successful, we cannot but express our respect and mourning for the armed comrades who sacrificed their lives (at this point, the whole place stood up in silence for three minutes). At present, there are thousands of political facilities. In the future, the permanent peace construction of the country will take this meeting as an important key, and the responsibility is very heavy. All comrades of our party must work harder with twelve points of effort, actively remedy the shortcomings and weaknesses in personnel administration and all construction, and determine good policies so that all important issues between the party and the government can be resolved completely and satisfactorily. Establish a grand plan for the future and look forward to the completion of its doctrine. In the past, the shortcomings were that when we were not successful, we were brave in fighting, but after success, the fighting power was reduced. There is also a common problem that we only meet but do not discuss, discuss but do not decide, decide but do not implement, and implement but do not act. This time, we must strive to correct it and avoid being criticized that the Fourth Plenary Session becomes the Fourth Unmeeting, and so on. The meeting was dismissed after taking pictures at ten o'clock.</p>
<p>First Meeting to Be Held Today</p>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session is scheduled to hold a preparatory meeting at 8:00 a.m. on the 13th in the First Meeting Hall of the Central Party Headquarters to decide on the candidates for the Presidium and Secretary-General. The first general meeting will be held at 9:00 a.m. to elect the members of the various review committees. It is said that the majority of the Central Standing Committee members advocate inviting Zhang Xueliang to attend the Fourth Plenary Session, which will be submitted to the 13th Preparatory Meeting for decision.</p>
<p>Contents of the Plan to Revitalize Politics</p>
<p>It is said that Chiang Kai-shek submitted a plan to the Fourth Plenary Session to revitalize politics, including three parts: (1) Improving the central system (2) Rectifying discipline (3) Determining the policy and the outline of governance.</p>
<p>Organizational Plan of Various Departments of the National Government</p>
<p>Regarding the organizational plan of the various departments of the National Government, the Central Committee has proposed to the Congress to merge the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, and to merge the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and there is also a proposal to establish the Aviation Administration as a department.</p>
<p>Chiang Encourages All Members of the Central Committee</p>
<p>On the morning of the 12th, Chiang Kai-shek, in the name of the Minister of the Central Organization Department, sent a letter of encouragement to all members of the Central Committee, the content of which can be divided into three paragraphs: 1. Lower-level party members should serve the people. 2. Upper-level party members should have a spirit of selflessness. 3. The boundaries between public and private matters should be very clear. Everyone should not only work hard but also endure grievances. Although the spirit of hard work of all comrades is praised by China and foreign countries, the spirit of enduring grievances is still insufficient. In the future, I hope that we can work hard to implement it. The original text is several thousand words long and is very sincere and painful.</p>
<p>The Issue of Candidates for the Heads of the Two Houses</p>
<p>The issue of candidates for the heads of the Executive Yuan and Supervisory Yuan is one of the important cases valued by this Congress. The Central Standing Committee members discussed it during a conversation on the 12th. It is said that the result is that the Congress will not discuss it temporarily on the 13th. According to a certain committee member, there are many difficulties in the selection of the President of the Executive Yuan. The majority of the Central Committee members advocate that the Chairman of the National Government should concurrently serve as the President.</p>
<p>Talks of the Central Standing Committee</p>
<p>The Central Standing Committee held talks at the Central Party Headquarters at 3:00 p.m. on the 12th. In addition to discussing the proposals submitted by the Central Standing Committee to the Fourth Plenary Session, it also finalized the agenda of the first general meeting on the 13th.</p>
<p>Proposals of the Central Standing Committee</p>
<p>The proposals submitted by the Central Standing Committee to the Fourth Plenary Session attach great importance to the reorganization of party affairs in various places. The Secretariat has submitted it to the Congress on the 12th.</p>
<p>Important Agenda of the Congress</p>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session will have important discussions on issues such as reorganizing party affairs, reorganizing finance, revitalizing politics, and eliminating banditry.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>India Round Table Conference Held in London</h3>
<p>The Indian Round Table Conference has opened in London. The British monarch delivered a training speech, and the government is optimistic. Politicians who have nothing to do with the government cannot help but doubt the success of the conference. Indian Hindus in India stopped working for one day because of the opening of the London Round Table Conference to express their grief. From these three aspects, their feelings are different. Those who are satisfied with success here regard it as a disgrace there. How can we talk about its failure?</p>
<p>The difference in ideas between the world's aggressors and the aggressed is like heaven and earth. The aggressed want to restore the inherent principles of mankind, while the aggressors indulge in the previous history of aggression, thinking that slightly returning the previous aggression is a great favor and special favor. In the eyes of the aggressed, the fundamental change is still the trick of the aggressor to fool people. Therefore, the result only increases the disturbance and there is no hope of reconciliation. The Round Table Conference in India was mostly produced by this mentality, and its results will inevitably still follow this mentality.</p>
<p>Not only the United Kingdom to India, but also other countries with colonies in the future will probably follow the evolution of this mentality, and its progress will be similar to the situation between the United Kingdom and India today.</p>

<h3>Indian Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>Officially opened yesterday; the British Emperor delivered a welcoming speech.</p>
<p>The important vacant seat is thought-provoking; opinions diverge on constitutional issues.</p>
<p>Indian teachers and students suspended classes to express their grief.</p>
<p>[Guomin News Agency], London, 12th. The Indian Round Table Conference was held in the Royal Hall of the British House of Lords at 1:00 PM today. The opening ceremony was presided over by the British Emperor, who delivered a welcoming speech stating, "I have convened meetings with my ministers several times, but have never met with British politicians and Indian representatives to jointly discuss the future governance of India. Since I last issued my intentions, many new ideas and proposals have emerged regarding the methods of the Indian government. Therefore, it is necessary to re-examine the situation in India. The importance of this conference and the future destiny of the British Empire depend entirely on the cooperation of all of you. There is no need for me to state this further. Today, I would like to express my sincere welcome to the proposals of the autonomous governments of all the major British Empire's member states. I am still concerned about the future of the Indian people. As long as their demands are legitimate, whether they are the majority or the minority, they should be considered. The strong, the weak, the rich, the poor, urban and rural people, any race, any religion, any political party, I treat them all equally, without any favoritism or dislike. The solution to the current situation lies in mutual concessions and harmonious cooperation. I hope that all of you present can create this good phenomenon, so that your names will be recorded in history and will be passed down forever." After the Emperor's speech, the President of the Five-Race Senate of India, Maharaja, stood up to deliver a reply, first thanking the British Emperor for his welcoming remarks and warm instructions, and then inviting British Prime Minister MacDonald to take the chair. Then he addressed the audience, saying that all of you present deeply feel that your mission is important, holding the key to creating a new era. As for India, it has reached an important period of constitutional change.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th. The Indian Round Table Conference will officially open in the House of Lords tomorrow. The first plenary session is scheduled for November 17th. A total of 86 representatives will attend, including 57 representatives from British India, 16 representatives from Indian princes, and 13 representatives from the British Parliament. Several preliminary meetings have been held for informal discussions. The government is optimistic about the conference's prospects because the spirit of the preliminary meetings has been excellent. However, politicians not affiliated with the government have doubts about the success of the conference, and some say that the absence of representatives from the Indian National Congress, i.e., the Gandhi Party, is a sign of the conference's failure. The representatives from British India have been working hard for several days to agree on the status that can be given to Muslims and other minorities, in order to facilitate consideration of the form of India's future constitution, but this effort has not yet yielded clear results. It seems that all the representatives expect that the autonomy of the Indian provinces and the central government will arise from this conference, but their opinions differ on procedural issues. The Hindu faction believes that the British government should declare to the conference at the beginning that the purpose of this meeting is to draft a constitution for India as an overseas autonomous territory. This faction regards issues such as Indian national defense, the status of minorities, and the status of princely states as internal affairs that can be resolved by autonomous India itself. However, Muslims and others, although they also regard the status of overseas autonomous territory as the ultimate goal, believe that attention should first be paid to all the special problems of India, because the constitution must guarantee the rights of minorities. Opinions are clearly divided on this difficulty, and other issues, such as whether India should have a federal constitution or a unified constitution, whether British India should formulate its own constitution or follow the entire Indian constitution, also have undercurrents. The attitude of the princes seems to be helpful in resolving the second problem. According to existing trends, if the British relationship is still maintained and the rights and status of the princes in their own states are not hindered, the assembly seems to be able to agree to cooperate with British India to jointly draft an autonomous constitution based on a federal constitution.</p>
<p>Reuters, Karachi, 12th. Indian teachers and students suspended classes today because today is the opening day of the Indian Round Table Conference in London, in order to express their grief. All shops are closed and markets are closed, but Muslims and European merchants are still open as usual.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th. Today's editorials all focus on the Indian Round Table Conference, which shows that the public pays great attention to this matter. General discussions are optimistic, but the difficulties of the process are not hidden. The British Emperor, accompanied by cabinet members, Indian princes, former Indian governors-general, governors of various provinces, and representatives of various political factions from the country and India, entered the House of Lords and began the opening ceremony after taking the throne. The procedure was roughly the same as that of the Naval Conference in January of this year. The British Emperor delivered a speech to the silver-made loudspeaker to be transmitted to the farthest parts of the earth, and a recording machine was set up to record the speech. The speech was sent to India by plane and made into a sound disc in a factory in Calcutta, which was distributed to all parts of India so that the Indian people could all hear the voice of their Emperor.</p>
<p>[Guomin News Agency], Berlin, 12th. German newspapers pay great attention to the Indian Round Table Conference held in London today, saying that this conference is not only related to the future of India, but also to the British Empire. However, the newspapers do not express much optimism about the actual results of this conference. The Berlin Qi Tong Bao said that there was a vacant seat and one person was silent at today's meeting. The silence of this one person was more revealing than the speech of the entire assembly. The silent person was Gandhi, and the vacant seat was the Indian seat. Although the politicians shook hands sincerely with each other when they left the round table, the important vacant seat remained vacant and was thought-provoking.</p>
<h3>The Disarmament Preparatory Committee Debates the Issue of Land Warfare Equipment</h3>
<p>German representative advocates direct restrictions; British representative expresses opposition. Reuters, Geneva, 11th. Today, the Disarmament Committee discussed the methods of restricting land warfare equipment. Some advocated direct restrictions, that is, each country should have a certain number of sharp weapons and a certain number of ammunition. Others advocated restrictions using the method of public announcement. British representative Cecil said that the direct restrictions proposed by the German representative were difficult to satisfy and that the method of public announcement should be adopted. He also said that the restriction of expenditure was the most effective method of restricting warfare equipment, and hoped that the United States could resolve its difficulties regarding the method of public announcement. U.S. Representative Gibson said that direct restrictions are the only satisfactory method. The United States already has an effective method of restriction using quantity and complete public announcement. If a public agreement binds a certain country to use the method of public announcement and allows other countries to adopt another method, then the United States may not oppose it. German representative Pinstorff said that direct restrictions are necessary for the disarmament agreement to be effective. The methods that have already been applied to Germany should also be applied to other countries.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 11th. The German representatives of the Disarmament Preparatory Committee in Geneva today participated in a two-minute silent tribute. The German National Rights Party newspaper considered it a shameful thing and was very indignant, saying that the German representatives should have withdrawn from the meeting like several German journalists had done.</p>
<p>[Guomin News Agency], Geneva, 12th. At today's meeting of the Disarmament Preparatory Committee, the German representative proposed that all countries publicly announce the actual situation of their existing armaments, saying that otherwise there would be no way to know the actual situation of each country's armaments, and how could a method of restriction be determined? Just like the previous London Naval Conference, the naval strength of the participating countries was first announced in detail, so the naval armament layer has now been fully understood, while the land armament is still in a black box.</p>
<h3>Russia Accuses Poincaré and Briand of Participating in Russian Counter-Revolutionary Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 11th. Russian Public Prosecutor Krylenko filed a public prosecution accusing former French Prime Minister Poincaré and current Foreign Minister Briand of being participants in a counter-revolutionary conspiracy. There are currently eight people in custody awaiting trial in this case, all of whom are accused of destructive activities in the hope of overthrowing the Soviet Russian government and restoring the rights of the middle class. The indictment states that the defendants had a criminal relationship with Poincaré and Briand. Poincaré and Briand were preparing to launch a military attack on Soviet Russia, and the defendants were instructed by French lawyers to jointly plan a military attack with French military personnel. The defendants planned to create a huge change in Russia's main industries in 1930 in order to facilitate French intervention and planned to incite the Red Army to bomb power plants and other buildings.</p>
<p>[Guomin News Agency], Paris, 11th. The case of eight well-known Soviet Russian technicians being accused of secretly receiving French money to sabotage the five-year industrial plan is likely to cause serious negotiations between France and Russia. The current French authorities strongly deny the Russian side's claim that the defendants cooperated with the French General Staff and secretly received their instructions, and that this move was approved by former French Prime Minister Poincaré and Foreign Minister Briand. They are also very indignant about the claim that the two men used Polish troops to organize an anti-Red Cross army plan. However, they admit that the French military officer mentioned by the Russian side does exist, so the government expects that after the Russian side's careful weaving of this case, there will be even more shocking confessions, which will lead to strong diplomatic action on the part of the French government.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Russian Debt Negotiations Break Down</h3>
<p>London News: After three weeks of discussions, negotiations between Britain and Russia over old debts have broken down again. Previously, the committee of experts appointed by the representatives of Britain and Russia had agreed to discuss the classification of all mutual old debt claims and debts separately, but there had been prolonged disputes over the detailed plan of classification and no results had been achieved. It is now clear that it has broken down. According to British experts, all the Russian representatives are likely to return home without success. (The World)</p>
<h3>Political Turmoil Suddenly Rises in Belgium</h3>
<p>[Guomin News Agency], Brussels, 11th. Political turmoil suddenly broke out in Belgium. Foreign Minister Hymans, Justice Minister Janson, Postal Minister Foulons, Education Minister Van Dievoet, and Transportation Minister Liebaert submitted their resignations to Prime Minister Jaspar after the European War Memorial Ceremony. Jaspar immediately resigned to the King of Belgium. The King then ordered Jaspar to reorganize the new cabinet. The root cause of this cabinet turmoil is that the hard-line cabinet members of the Army Department, such as Van Dievoet, insisted on a non-compromising attitude towards the Flemish issue, so it is expected that Jaspar will take the opportunity to exclude these cabinet members.</p>
<h3>Cuban Student Uprising</h3>
<p>Influenced by the revolutionary trend</p>
<p>Associated Press, Cuban Capital, 11th. Today, a nationwide student uprising occurred in Cuba, and people from other sectors also echoed it, which shows that the recent South American revolutionary trend will have an impact here.</p>
<h3>Minister Wu's Important Speech on Armistice Day</h3>
<p>The United States has no sincerity in abolishing consular jurisdiction and is only deceiving people by maintaining justice.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 11th. Chinese Minister Wu Chaoshu said in a speech at the World Friendship Alliance meeting on Armistice Day that the United States occupies an excellent position in world peace, because it has soldiers without fear and wealth without desire, and its position towards China is even better, because the United States has no territorial ambitions or political functions here. At a time when the world is resisting injustice, lasting peace can only be hoped for after the three major causes of war are eliminated. Taking the issue of consular jurisdiction in China as an example, it is an infringement of China's sovereignty and should be returned to China as soon as possible, but after China applied for it, it has been delayed and not granted. This kind of action is too unfair to the Chinese people. Then, Clerk, a former reporter for the Beijing Guide, gave a speech advocating the amendment of the U.S. immigration law to eliminate racial discrimination. Clerk said that once the ethnic issue is resolved, the issue of foreign nationals in the East will be easily resolved. [Guomin News Agency], Paris, 11th. French politician Poincaré gave a speech on Armistice Day advocating the organization of an international police force to ensure international peace, saying that the current competition and expansion of armaments among countries is enough to hinder peace. Attorney General Perret also gave a speech in Alsace, saying that security is above all issues, and that all treaties must be faithfully followed, but if serious difficulties arise, France will not refuse to submit them to international arbitration.</p>

<p>Reuters, Brazilian Capital, 12th. The government has ordered the dissolution of Congress and the city council.</p>
<h3>Romanian King Seeks to Resolve Congressional Stalemate</h3>
<p>Reaching out to the Liberal and National Parties</p>
<p>[Guomin News Agency], Romanian Capital, 11th. In order to resolve the congressional stalemate, the King of Romania sent his private secretary to the leaders of the Liberal and National opposition parties to convey the King's wishes, urging the two parties to return to Congress and actively participate in political affairs. It is hoped that this extraordinary measure by the King will succeed.</p>
<h3>Finland Bans Communist Propaganda</h3>
<p>Congress passes three bills</p>
<p>National, Helsinki, 11th. The Finnish Congress today passed three bills banning communist propaganda by a two-thirds majority. All members other than those of the non-socialist faction also joined the government party in voting in favor. This bill can be regarded as the prelude to the upcoming broad revision of the laws banning communism.</p>
<h3>Unemployment in the United Kingdom Increases</h3>

<h3>Rubber Trees in Dutch East Indies Cut Down in Preparation for Planting Rice</h3>

<p>The Capital Holds</p>
<p>Premier's Birthday Commemoration</p>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held a Premier's Birthday Commemoration ceremony at the auditorium at 8:00 AM on the 12th. Attendees included Chiang Kai-shek, Tai Chuan-hsien, Ho Ying-chin, Hu Han-min, Sun Fo, Chen Mingshu, Ye Chucang, Chu Pei-teh, Wu Zhihui, Yu Youren, Song Ziwen, He Chengjun, Li Wenfan, Ding Chao Wu, Wang Boling, Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Qun, Liu Zhi, Yang Shuzhuang, Zhou Qigang, Chen Lifu, Chen Zhaoying, Liu Jiwen, Liu Luyin, Ding Weifen, Zeng Yangfu, Fang Juehui, Wang Zhengting, Chen Yaoyuan, Zhang Zhen, Kong Xiangxi, Liu Wendao, Zhang Daofan, Gui Chongji, Yu Jingtang, Jiao Yitang, Ma Chaojun, Chen Ce, Miao Peicheng, Cheng Tianfang, Ke Xinge, Wu Jingheng, Zhang Renjie, Lin Sen, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Ji, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, Li Yuying, En Ke Ba Gu, Chen Bulei, Lin Yungai, Ming Qingyang, and Zhang Xueliang, Zhu Guangmu and Central Party Headquarters staff, totaling over 600 people. After Chairman Hu Hanmin led the ceremony, he delivered a speech stating that the significance of commemorating the Premier's birthday today is extremely profound. All nations solemnly commemorate the birthdays of great martyrs and sages. Our commemoration of the Premier's birthday is to remember the Premier's great achievements and be faithful followers of the Premier. The Premier was the creator of the Three Principles of the People in the world. The day of the Premier's birth is also the day of the birth of the Three Principles of the People. In thousands of years of history, both Chinese and foreign, there has never been such a great personality and great doctrine. Europe and America consider Napoleon and Washington as great figures. The Chinese used to admire them as well, but after the Three Principles of the People, it is felt that Napoleon only had military achievements and, apart from knowing nationalism, did not think much about democracy and people's livelihood. As for Washington, his achievements are indeed greater than Napoleon's, but when Washington created the United States, the population was only seven or eight million, compared to the Premier's creation of the Republic of China with 400 million people. The difficulty and magnitude of their achievements are different. Moreover, Washington only broke away from British independence and did not determine any doctrine, so his spirit cannot be as great as the Premier's. As for Marx's theories, they were revised rather than created. Therefore, the Premier's Three Principles of the People are indeed a doctrine that can lead the world. Our commemoration of the Premier's birthday is to remember the Premier's achievements and continue the Premier's work, so that we can demonstrate the significance of commemorating the Premier. The Premier's thinking does not dwell on the past or the present, but seeks progress in the future. This is the Premier's greatest teaching. We commemorate the birthday by following this great teaching and putting it into practice. The Premier's teachings have three "musts": "must awaken the people," "must follow what I have written..." and "must realize it in the shortest possible time." If these three "musts" are not fully achieved, the revolution has not yet succeeded. Therefore, we should continue to work hard and fight together. We must put the Premier's teachings into practice and seek progress in the future. Everyone must view it this way to commemorate the Premier's birthday and never forget this kind of commemoration. Next, Wu Jingheng gave a speech stating that the Premier's physical body concluded after sixty-five years, but the Premier's spirit will live on with the world. The Republic of China created by the Premier will also live on with the world. The Three Principles of the People created by the Premier are the great law of the world. The great laws of the past five thousand years in the world have not been complete until the Premier's time. Imperialism has become a thing of the past, and the principle of people's livelihood is the savior of the present. Ordinary people wish others a hundred years of life, but I wish the Three Principles of the People ten thousand years of life, and the great harmony of the world five hundred million years of life. I wish the Premier's spirit to live on with the world. After the speech, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>The National Government held a Premier's Birthday Commemoration ceremony at the auditorium at 10:30 AM. Attendees included Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Tai Jitao, Zhang Xueliang, Lin Sen, Zhu Peide, Song Ziwen, Yang Shuzhuang, He Yingqin, Wang Chonghui, Ma Fuxiang, He Yaotsu, Yi Peiji, Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Qun, Wang Zhengting, Chen Yi, and the heads of various yuan, ministries, and commissions, as well as officials and military attachés from the National Government, totaling over 600 people. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the ceremony, he delivered an opening speech stating that today is the Premier's birthday, which is also the day of the birth of the Party's doctrine. Since the Premier's death, the Party's Three Principles of the People and the Premier's life's work have been entirely entrusted to us to continue. Therefore, the future of the Three Principles of the People and the Premier's life depends on the efforts of our comrades. Today, in commemorating the Premier, I hope that everyone will not only follow the Premier's will, but also follow the Premier's "peaceful struggle to save China" and continue to work hard. I deeply hope that after the military ends, everyone will unite to respect the Premier's will and make a great determination to create a clean government. If we can do this, the Three Principles of the People can be realized. I hope everyone will encourage each other. In the future, anyone who makes mistakes should be strictly corrected. Even if I, Chiang Kai-shek, make mistakes, I hope everyone will strictly supervise me so that we can achieve the goal of true construction. Next, Tai Jitao gave a speech stating that today's commemoration of the Premier's birthday coincides with the complete elimination of reactionary forces. The country has entered a clear period. In this period, commemorating the Premier's birthday, I deeply believe that the Premier's spirit and doctrine will be further promoted, so that the whole country can be influenced by the doctrine and strive to build in accordance with the Premier's doctrine. I just heard Chairman Chiang's instructions, hoping that from now on, under the leadership of the Premier's doctrine, we will earnestly carry out the various undertakings outlined in the National Construction Program, especially hoping that appropriate talents will be appointed to appropriate positions in the government, so that everyone can concentrate on their work to fulfill the purpose of everyone being able to use their talents to the fullest. Chairman Chiang appropriately said that he hopes to create a clean government. I would like to add that in addition to creating a clean government, we should also create a capable government, so that capable talents can work hard for a capable government. After Tai's speech, Chairman Chiang said that Commander Zhang Hanqing has arrived in the capital to participate in the Premier's Birthday Commemoration, and he would like to take this opportunity to introduce Commander Zhang to give a speech. After Chiang's announcement, the audience applauded thunderously. Zhang Xueliang then took the stage amidst applause and said that he was honored to be ordered by the Chairman to say a few words. Xueliang has not made any contributions or achievements to the Party and the country, but he is deeply ashamed of the government's generous treatment. Today, in commemorating the Premier's birthday, we truly believe that the Premier's personality is great and that all the work he did was for the country and the people, not for personal gain. Therefore, everyone respects the Premier's personality. Xueliang believes that if we can all follow what the Premier did, we will naturally have a clean government and a clean country to seek happiness for the people. After Zhang's speech, the music was played and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>The Capital's various circles held a celebration ceremony for the Premier's Birthday at the public sports field at 9:00 AM. Representatives from all levels of the Party headquarters, various institutions, groups, and the public, totaling over 10,000 people, attended. Shi Weihuan was elected as chairman to lead the ceremony. Gu Zhenglun raised the flag, and several airplanes released leaflets in the sky. The chairman delivered an opening speech stating that the Premier's birth sixty-five years ago was the day of the birth of national salvation for the whole world. The Premier, seeing the corruption of the Qing government, created a revolution and overthrew the autocratic politics of more than 4,000 years. His great achievements are recorded in history. The ancients considered establishing virtue, establishing speech, and establishing meritorious service as immortal achievements. The Premier embodied all three in one person. In the 20th century world, he is truly the greatest of mankind, and it can be said that he has no predecessor and no successor. Our admiration for the Premier cannot be expressed by words alone. We must always respect the Premier's great personality, abide by his teachings, and implement the Three Principles of the People as the government's political goal to show that the Premier's spirit is always present. Vice Commander Zhang arrived in the capital today and hopes to sincerely support the central government and assist in building a new Republic of China. Then the future history must be more glorious. Next, Zhu Wenzhong, representative of the National Government, and Chen Haicheng, representative of the Legislative Yuan, also gave speeches. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Liao Zhang Leaves Yingkou and Shenyang Southbound</h3>
<p>Central representatives Wu Tiecheng and Liu Guang and others traveled together. Shi Yousan went to Tianjin on the same day, claiming to have reached a satisfactory agreement.</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: There were rumors that Zhang Xueliang would meet Commander-in-Chief Chiang in Tianjin, Peiping, Qingdao, or Nanjing. A few days ago, it was decided to meet in Qingdao, and staff were sent to prepare the headquarters and arrange all security matters. Finally, after two contacts by Wu Tiecheng, it was decided to meet in the capital. Zhang's departure special train was ordered by the Beining Railway Bureau two days ago to prepare two trains. The first train had a pistol team, guard battalion, communications company, six cars, two military trucks, and various military supplies. The second train was Zhang's special train. The cars were divided into five groups: general affairs, secretary, staff, adjutant, and military supply. The military supply office was temporarily added. The head of the general affairs office was Zhu Guangmu (Director of the Northeast Telecommunications Administration). The head of the secretariat was Ye Biliang (Secretary of the Northeast Frontier Defense Commander's Office). The head of the staff office was Bao Wenye (Director of the Special Zone Police Department). The head of the adjutant's office was Huang Xiansheng (Commander of the 20th Brigade of the Northeast Army). The head of the military supply office was Su Quanbin. The above five offices are all temporary in nature, and the staff have not been separately appointed. Central representatives Wu Tiecheng, Liu Guang, Zhang Ji, and He Fenglin and others traveled along, all riding in the second train. Most of the attendants in the special train brought their families, so there was a lot of luggage. There were a total of twenty-three cars, decorated with new paint. Most of the cars were made of steel and were very heavy, so each train was towed by three locomotives. The special train was fired up at about 5:00 PM on the 7th. The servants and other personnel serving on the train also boarded the train separately to arrange everything. At 8:00 PM, the attendants were ordered to board the train one after another. The first train left at 10:00 PM to clear the way. At the same time, from Zhang Xueliang's residence to the new Shenyang station, the road was full of military police, with strict security. The new station, Laodaokou, and Huanggu Tun station were all the responsibility of the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. The area near the Liaoning General Station was the responsibility of the Third Branch of the Commercial Port Public Security Bureau. Zhang arrived at the station at 10:30 PM. Military and political leaders all went to the station to see him off. After Zhang boarded the train, as the train headed west, military music played loudly. After the train left the station, the send-offs dispersed. Zhang's itinerary is to first arrive in Tianjin, stay there for a day or two, and then transfer to the Jinpu Railway to the south to pay respects to the tomb of the late Premier, meet Commander-in-Chief Chiang, and attend the Fourth Plenary Session, before heading north to Peiping to preside over the aftermath. Zhang's trip will take at least two weeks before he can return to Shenyang. The security of Shenyang is extremely important. At this time, when the Northeast Communists are lurking and plotting, it is especially necessary for someone to preside over it. Therefore, Zhang has entrusted all military and political powers to Zhang Zuoxiang, Chairman of Jilin Province.</p>
<p>Before Vice Commander Zhang Xueliang left Shenyang, Shi Yousan, commander of the Thirteenth Route Army, prepared to return to Shunhe. Shi's negotiation of pay and defense areas was satisfactory. On the 7th at noon, Shi's special train was fired up. His attendants and guards were all ready. The guards boarded the train first. At 3:00 PM, Shi and many attendants arrived at the station. The Frontier Defense Commissioner's Office sent a military band and a garrison team to provide security and escort. Zhang Zuoxiang, Chairman of Jilin Province, Wan Fulin, Chairman of Jiang Province, Zhang Jinghui, Administrative Chief of the Special Zone, Liu Shangqing, Committee Member of the Northeast Political Committee, Wang Shuhan, Secretary-General of the Frontier Defense, Rong Zhen, Director of the Military Department, Zhou Lian, Director of the Military Supply Department, Yang Zhengzhi, Director of the Adjutant Department, Ji Jinchun, Councilor, Yan Chaoxi, Liu Duoquan, Commander of the Guards, Wang Yizhe, Commander of the First Brigade, and Sun Xuchang, Director of the Police Department, all went to the station to see him off.

Before long, Zhang Xueliang also arrived at the station to see Shi off, accompanied by his bodyguard adjutant Tan Hai in car number 1385. Zhang and Shi talked briefly on the train. Zhang then took the dignitaries who were seeing him off on the train and got off the train together. Shi shook hands and thanked Zhang and the other personnel before boarding the train and heading west. Zhang Xueliang and Zhang Zuoxiang rode in the same car back to the residence. Shi's adjutant chief Sun Tieling and Bi Guangyuan, the former committee member of Shandong Province, did not travel together because they were ordered by Shi to set up the Thirteenth Route Army Liaison Office in Shenyang. Sun and others moved from Wan Fulin's private residence to the Zhaodai Office on Sanjing Road on the evening of the 6th. According to Shi's interview with reporters, the results of this trip were extremely satisfactory. After arriving in Tianjin, he plans to stay for a day or two to meet with Chairman Wang Shuchang, and then go to Peiping to meet with Garrison Commander Yu Xuezhong before returning to his defense area.

The military police inside and outside the new station were densely packed like ants. The station was decorated with the flags of all nations and five-colored small electric lights, as well as welcome slogans from the Municipal Party Department. When the track-clearing car passed Beitang at 6:00 PM, the order was given to cut off traffic, and no idlers were allowed to enter the station. When the special train passed Tanggu, the Railway Bureau was ordered to report by long-distance telephone that it had been changed to get off at the East Station. The welcomers then rushed to the East Station by car. Half of the soldiers who were on guard at the new station were also mobilized to the East Station. As soon as they had caught their breath, another phone call came (when the special train was arriving at Junliangcheng) saying that they would still get off at the new station. The welcomers and the guarding troops rushed back to the new station. The track-clearing car arrived at the East Station at 7:50 PM. The special train arrived at the East Station at 8:50 PM.

<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Then he returned to his residence at No. 32, Route de France in the French Concession. The attendants stayed at Heng Jide.

According to Zhang, the military affairs in the north have now come to an end, so he is going to Jin to meet Chairman Chiang to discuss the aftermath issues. I am not a representative sent by the central government. There is no need to submit proposals at this Fourth Plenary Session. If necessary, I will only attend as an observer. Shi Yousan's defense area has not yet been determined and is temporarily stationed in the area from Shunde to Zhangde on the Pinghan Railway, where they will jointly defend with the Northeast Army. It is said that Zhang's stay in Jin this time will be about a week, or at most ten days, and then he will return to Tianjin. At that time, he may go to Peiping. The two governments of the province and city set up a banquet at the West Lake Hotel at 7:00 PM this afternoon to welcome Zhang. Zhang will leave Tianjin tonight or tomorrow morning (November 9th).</p>
<h3>He Yaozu and Zhang Qun Welcome Zhang Northward at Jining</h3>
<p>Arrived in Xuzhou on the morning of the 9th and arrived in Jinan in the evening. Left Jinan by special train to the north on the 10th.</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Zhang Xueliang decided to go to Jin to meet Chiang to deal with the aftermath of the northern issue. He Yaozu and Zhang Qun were ordered to go north to welcome him. The special train left Pukou at 7:00 PM on the 8th, with the Yungui armored car clearing the way first. Arrived at Xuzhou Station at 8:00 AM on the 9th. The reporter met He at the station. According to He, after the military ended, the central government handed over the northern aftermath issue to Vice Commander Zhang for handling. Vice Commander Zhang needs to discuss various issues with Commander-in-Chief Chiang, so he decided to go to Jin during the Fourth Plenary Session. Before I left Jin, Commander-in-Chief Chiang had already set off from Fenghua and is expected to arrive in Jin today. Zhang Xuezhi just received a telegram from Peiping saying that Zhang Xueliang will arrive in Tianjin today and is scheduled to go south from Tianjin tomorrow morning. He said that this trip will require going to Tianjin to meet with Zhang. He is expected to be able to accompany Zhang through Xuzhou to Jin tomorrow night. Then he continued to say that Zhang's trip to Jin will definitely thoroughly resolve the northern aftermath issue, and there will be no problems with the military in Jin and Shaanxi.

The following is the welcome method stipulated, hoping that it will be implemented immediately: (A) Paste four kinds of slogans at each station: Welcome Vice Commander Zhang, Welcome Vice Commander Zhang who promotes unification, Welcome Vice Commander Zhang who has worked hard to consolidate border defense, and Welcome Vice Commander Zhang who sincerely supports the central government in eliminating the remaining rebels. (B) The slogans should be written on white cloth and paper of various colors. (C) The station should be cleaned up extensively to create a neat and solemn atmosphere. (D) Each station should notify the garrison stationed at the station to form a team and line up to conduct vigilance and perform the most respectful salute when the special train passes.

Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government, and Li Shuchun, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, went to the station to welcome him. There was a provincial government military band and a company of hand-gun brigade soldiers at the station. After He Zhang got off the train, he shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcomers. According to He Zhang, this trip is to welcome Vice Commander Zhang, and there is no other task. Whether to continue north from Jinan or wait in Jinan will be determined after Vice Commander Zhang leaves Tianjin. Soon after, He Zhang, Han Fuju, and Li Shuchun went to the Jiaoji Hotel to stay.

The Jinan Municipal Public Security Bureau has ordered the entire city to fly flags to express its welcome. (10th)</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Returns to Jin from Zhengzhou</h3>
<p>He Talks to the Press About the Situation in Yu and Shaanxi</p>
<p>He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs and Director of the Zhengzhou Headquarters, returned to Jin by plane from Zhengzhou at 1:15 PM yesterday (10th). A reporter from the Central News Agency went to visit and had the following conversation with He: The reporter asked, "When will the minister leave Zhengzhou, and will he have to go to the front again in the future?" He replied, "I left Zhengzhou at 9:30 AM today. This time, I am accompanying Commander-in-Chief Sun Lianzhong to Jin to visit Commander-in-Chief Chiang and meet with Vice Commander Zhang, and to participate in the opening ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session. I will probably stay in Jin for three or four days before returning to the front." The reporter asked, "What is the situation of Feng and Yan's troops now?" He replied, "Feng's generals, such as Ji Hongchang, Liang Guanying, Sun Lianzhong, Zhang Yinxiang, Ge Yunlong, and Zhang Zhan, have long disapproved of Feng's actions and have sincerely supported the central government in seeking national unification. However, at that time, they were held hostage by Feng and could do nothing. Therefore, as soon as they had the opportunity, they came to surrender. The rest, such as Zhang Weixi, Tian Jinkai, Feng Zhi'an, and Ming Baoshan, with a total of about 60,000 to 70,000 troops, have all been surrounded and disarmed by the central army in Xinzheng. As for Liu Yufen of Shaanxi, he was indeed captured alive by the troops under Commander-in-Chief Yang Hucheng. Song Zheyuan's whereabouts are unknown and it is heard that he has died in the chaos. The troops that are now following Feng in southern Jin are only a few thousand new recruits without guns recruited by Liu Zhen and the remnants of Pang Bingxun's troops, and of course they will no longer pose a problem. As for Yan Xishan's troops, they never had any combat capability. After suffering repeated defeats on the Longhai and Jinpu lines, they had already lost more than half of their strength. They then planned to retreat to Shanxi to linger on. Seeing that the situation was gone and there was no way to recover, they issued a telegram on the fourth day of the month, claiming to have been strictly ordered to supervise his departure and return to the fields, seemingly still wanting to live in Shanxi, holding the army hostage to protect his territory. His warlord's mind and feudal thoughts are unbreakable. However, the Shanxi army has no fighting spirit, and Niangziguan is far less dangerous than Tongguan. As long as the central army attacks, it can be resolved in the shortest possible time." The reporter asked, "What is the situation in Henan?" He replied, "Henan has suffered greatly due to the war, and Feng's rebels have wantonly plundered it, leading to the decline of democracy. Since Feng's defeat, local order has gradually been restored." The reporter asked, "I heard that the minister flew to Xi'an to inspect. What are your thoughts?" He replied, "Since the recovery of Xi'an, Feng's troops have been completely resolved. However, bandits have risen up and harassed the local area, and Zhen Turen's troops have the worst reputation. Commander-in-Chief Yang has captured and executed Zhen. Now he has sent troops to suppress them everywhere, and order can be restored. Over the years, Feng has ravaged and plundered Shaanxi without leaving any trace, and natural disasters have occurred frequently, and famine has struck repeatedly. The suffering of the people of Shaanxi is the worst in the country. It is said that in Wugong County, which originally had a population of 150,000, more than 80,000 people starved to death in one year. The corpses were piled up and no one cared about them. There were also thousands of disaster victims who wanted to escape from Xi'an to the border of Henan. Because the residents along the way lacked food and had no way to beg, they all starved to death on the way. The situation was extremely tragic. The people of Shaanxi have been under the oppression of warlords for a long time, and there is no light of day. It is painful to speak of. From now on, the most important issue in Shaanxi is famine relief. If you have not been there in person, you will never know the depth of the suffering of the people of Shaanxi. The central government will definitely find a way to save them in the future. I also hope that philanthropists at home and abroad will pay special attention to the Shaanxi disaster and raise huge sums of money to save these starving people."</p>
<h3>Recent War Situation Near Nanning</h3>
<p>Outbreak of Three-pronged War in the Upper Reaches of the Dahe River; Guangdong Air Force Continuously Bombs Nanning</p>
<p>A Guangzhou dispatch reports that the war situation in Nanning, Guangxi Province, has recently become tense again. According to front-line news, the Zhang-Gui army fears that the Central Army will reinforce Guangxi, so they are taking this opportunity to make a final struggle. In recent days, most of the Zhang-Gui army in Nanning has gathered there. It is estimated that the 11th Division of Zhang Fakui's troops and two regiments of Huang Heling's troops are stationed outside the East Gate of Nanning City. At the Lu Gong Ancestral Hall and Gao'ao north of the city, there are three regiments of Wei Yunsong's troops. In Xixiangtang west of the city, there is the Independent Regiment directly under Li Zongren and two battalions of Huang Xuchu's troops. In Shanglin, Wuming and other places, there are three regiments of Yang Tenghui's troops. The above-mentioned troops are mixed and dispatched, with Li Shouren as the chief commander at the front and Zhang Fakui as the deputy commander. On the first day of this month, they advanced towards the 8th and 10th Route Armies in four directions. Yang Tenghui and Huang Xuchu's troops intercepted the 10th Route Yunnan Army at Nalong. A fierce battle broke out between the two sides in Wuming. The Yunnan Army's Zhang Chong Division resisted bravely, and the Gui army suffered heavy casualties and retreated to Dahe. The Zhang-Gui army also advanced in three directions, with the remnants of Zhang Fakui's troops taking the central route, moving from Shanglin to the Bin Yang position of the 8th Route Army. The number of people was about 2,000. They were met head-on by the Ye Zhao Brigade stationed in Bin Yang. After a fierce battle of about six hours, Yu Hanmou, the commander of the 59th Division of the 8th Route Army, immediately increased the support of the Peng Linsheng Department of the Teaching Regiment. The enemy suffered more than half of its losses and was defeated back to Qianjiang. The 59th Division followed up and captured many prisoners. At the same time, about 2,000 troops of the Gui army's right wing, Bai Chongxi's troops, invaded Yongchun and Hengxian on the morning of the 1st. The Yang Dingzhong Department and Zhu Weizhen Department of the newly编16th Division of the 8th Route Army stationed there rose up to meet them. The two sides were locked in intense combat. Later, the Huang Zhiqiu Brigade of the 63rd Division of the 8th Route Army arrived and defeated the Bai Chongxi and Wei Yunsong troops. Currently, the Huang Brigade is firmly defending Guixian as a rear support for Yang's division in Yongchun. At noon on the 1st, the left wing of the Gui army, led by Li Zongren, once again led the militia army from Liuzhou along Pingletu to attack Majiang. It is heard that this remnant force is Tang Shengming's Hunan Army, about 1,000 people. One to two thousand troops of Zhang Fakui's troops were recently transferred to Xiuren and Lipu, and it seems that they have a tendency to move towards the Fu River. The 8th Route Army is currently preparing to launch a large-scale attack on Nanning to first break the enemy's base and then divide its troops to attack Liuzhou, which will be easier to do. For the Fu River, they have decided to take a defensive posture. The Wuxing Camp has sent hundreds of water mines to the rear to be distributed along the defense line below Zhaoping and Mengshan. Two thousand taidao knives were also ordered to be made in the rear for each division to form a taidao knife team. Each division is equipped with a taidao knife team of about 150 people, specializing in charging and destroying the defensive lines of the enemy in southern Vietnam. It has also been decided that the air force team will launch a general attack on Nanning City. Starting from the 6th, bombs were dropped on Nanning. Today (the 7th), Captain Hu Jinya led the Zhongshan, Nanhai, Taishan, Zhujiang, Panyu, Nanxiong, Dongguan, Yingde, Qujiang, and Changjiang planes, carrying powerful bombs, to Nanning to bomb the enemy. The 8th Route Army headquarters has prepared 100,000 yuan in relief funds for the future relief of bombed residents. On the army side, the Li Yangjing Department of the 63rd Division will be the vanguard of the attack on Nanning, with the Yang Dingzhong Department of the 16th Division as the reserve team. The Huang Zhiwen Department of the 126th Brigade under Li's division will coordinate with Yang's division to advance from Guixian along the Dahe River towards Yongchun County to attack the flank of Nanning City. The Huang Yanhuan Department of the 125th Brigade will join the Huang Renhuan Brigade of Yu Hanmou's division to attack the front of Nanning from Binyang via Santang. (November 7th)</p>
<h3>Ruan Zhaochang Leads Troops to Jiangxi</h3>
<p>A Wuhu dispatch reports that after the Jiangxi bandits were surrounded by the Central Army, they suddenly disturbed the border of Anhui. The Huizhou region is very nervous, and Qiupu even fell. The telegraph poles and wires of the county and Wangjiang and Anqing were also destroyed by bandits. In addition to Anqing sending a portion of its troops to deal with the situation, Chen Tiaoyuan also ordered the special task force of Hao Jiajun, which was stationed in Datong, to go to suppress the bandits. Now, Ruan Zhaochang of the 55th Division has also been ordered to lead all of his troops to the border of Anhui and Jiangxi to assist the armies of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi in preventing and surrounding the bandits. The 163rd Brigade of the division has already departed from Datong to the vicinity of Huizhou and Qimen. The 164th Brigade of Li Songshan, which is stationed in Wuhu, has also been continuously transporting troops to Anqing for the past two days, taking the route through Wangjiang to advance towards the Jiangxi border. Division Commander Ruan, with his troops having fully departed, specially took the Jiang'an ship this morning to lead the division headquarters and directly subordinate artillery and engineering battalion troops to the province. The local security of Wuhu and various counties in southern Anhui is still being handled by the Xu Guoting Regiment stationed in Wuhu by the 57th Division. Because Xu is responsible as the commander of the 6th Bandit Suppression Zone, Xu also believes that the bandit disasters in Xuan City, Guangde, Langxi and other counties have been very serious recently, and the bandits in Langguang have gathered to more than a thousand people. In order to fundamentally eliminate them, a comprehensive plan must be made. Especially today (10th), he summoned the county magistrates of the 11 counties under the jurisdiction of the 6th District, including Nanling, Xuan City, Dangtu, Guangde, and Fanchang, to hold a bandit suppression conference at the command headquarters. More than 20 people, including the county magistrates and representatives of the counties, attended the meeting. Commander Xu presided over the meeting, and first the counties reported on the situation of the bandits, and then decided on the following measures: (1) Each joint county shall formulate a method for joint patrols and draw maps according to the terrain to jointly handle the matter. (2) The command headquarters shall order the local officials and gentry of each county to earnestly recruit villagers to serve as guides for bandit suppression. (3) The command headquarters shall strictly order each county to check the household registration within a time limit to purify the source of bandits. (4) The command headquarters shall formulate sleeve badges, passwords, and identification flags and issue them to each county for unification. (10th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin-Longhai Railways Begin Reorganization</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways Sends Personnel to Inspect the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Lines; Sectional Train Service</p>
<p>A Xuzhou dispatch reports that the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways were in the midst of the recent military affairs, and now that the military operations have ended, the transportation headquarters of the two railways have also been revoked. Although traffic has been restored, the railway administration is still in the process of reorganization. The recent situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin-Pukou Railway: Since the Tianjin-Pukou Railway resumed direct through traffic on the 1st of this month, traffic has been relatively smooth. However, many vehicles were stored on other lines during the war, so in addition to the daily express trains and the four weekly round-trip Pingpu trains, short-distance ticket trains have not yet resumed, and there are also few carriages attached to each ticket train, and passengers are very crowded. Freight vehicles are also in short supply. The Xuzhou Transportation Association had a conflict with the railway over this issue last month, declaring a suspension of freight transportation and requesting instructions from the Ministry of Railways, which has now been fortunately resolved. It is heard that there are now only more than 200 vehicles and more than 20 locomotives on the entire railway. The Ministry of Railways sent Counselor Liang Hancao and Deputy Director Zhu Lvyun to take the Pingpu train north from Pupu on the evening of the 8th and passed through Xuzhou on the morning of the 9th. According to the talks, they went to Jinan and Tianjin to inspect the railway conditions. It is likely that they will need to contact the Tianjin office. The railway bureau also sent Xu Ruitian, Chen Mengruo, and Liu Yimin and others to go west through Xuzhou on the 9th to investigate the vehicles stored on the Longhai Railway in preparation for transporting them back for reorganization to benefit transportation.</p>
<p>Longhai Railway: The entire Longhai Line has been opened to traffic, but it is operated in sections. On the western section, three or four trains run between Xuzhou and Zhengzhou, five or six trains run between Bian and Luo, and seven or eight trains run between Luo and Shaanxi. The roadbed on the western road has been damaged year after year and has not been thoroughly repaired, and there are also few vehicles. According to investigations, there are a total of more than 300 vehicles and about 30 locomotives on the entire railway, and most of them are occupied by the military, resulting in extremely crowded passengers on each ticket train. It is currently determined that the special express train between Xuzhou and Zhengzhou will resume from the 10th, with a planned round trip of twice a week. It is unknown whether this can be achieved. The wages of railway employees from Lanfeng to Lingbao have been in arrears for seven months. The railway bureau has only issued the salary for the most recent month, and the remaining arrears must be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for handling. As for the unfinished road construction west of Lingbao, it has not yet been possible to start continuous repairs. The location of the management bureau has also not been determined. From a business perspective, it is appropriate in Xuzhou; from a road construction perspective, it is appropriate in Zhengzhou. (9th)</p>
<h3>Shandong Commercial Bank Will Resume Business</h3>
<p>A Jinan dispatch reports that the former Shandong Commercial Bank had the oldest qualifications among the banks in Jinan City and was the tacit leader of the province's economic circles. In the spring of the 17th year, it collapsed due to Zhang Zongchang's excessive borrowing of funds. The Yumaogongli Money Bureau and various banks were also affected and collapsed. The city's financial situation was greatly affected. At the time of the bank's collapse, more than 800,000 yuan of banknotes were issued, falling to 20% of their face value. In the spring of the 18th year, in order to maintain the resumption of the bank's business, creditors (those with deposits) and noteholders (those with the bank's banknotes) decided to order the bank to resume business on July 1st of the 18th year, with banknotes redeemed in five years and deposits repaid in ten years. Just after the agreement was reached, the provincial government moved from Tai'an to Jinan. The former Director of Industry and Commerce, Chen Luanshu, believed that the bank's internal affairs were complicated and must be cleared up first. Therefore, it was decided that the Industry and Commerce Department, the creditor party, the noteholder party, and the capital party (the bank's directors) should organize a commercial bank clearing office to clear up all the bank's debts, claims, and property. The clearing committee consisted of three people from the Industry and Commerce Department and two committee members from each of the other three parties, for a total of nine people. Although the clearing work was interrupted by the Jin army entering Jinan and other incidents, it has not been suspended. As of now, it has been completed. It is estimated that 800,000 yuan of banknotes were issued by the bank, and 600,000 yuan have been recovered and stored with cut corners. The remaining unrecovered banknotes are no more than 200,000 yuan. The debts are about 1 million yuan, and the claims are also 1 million yuan, which can be offset. In addition, the bank also has several properties, and the directors Song Biru, Ji Zhiting, and others have raised 300,000 yuan and recruited 200,000 yuan of new shares, totaling 500,000 yuan. After discussing with the creditor party and the noteholder party, the bank will resume business immediately. Deposits will be repaid in five years, with 20% of the deposits repaid annually for the first four years and all deposits repaid in the fifth year. This plan has been reported to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines, and the Ministry of Agriculture has approved the bank to raise capital in cash and wait for personnel to check and verify it. If there is indeed a fund of 500,000 yuan, it will be allowed to resume business. The directors are now raising capital in preparation for verification, and the bank can resume business as late as January 1st next year. The market price of the bank's banknotes has now risen from 20% to 42% of their face value. (November 10th)</p>
<h3>Qiupu County, Anhui Province, Harassed by Bandits</h3>
<p>Occupied for Three Days and Recovered Immediately</p>
<p>An Anqing dispatch reports that Qiupu County, 130 miles from the provincial capital, has been repeatedly harassed by bandits. Last month, Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, was captured by the communist bandits led by Fang Zhimin. Qiupu was panicked because it was close to Pengze. Later, the Fang bandits withdrew from Pengze and fled to the mountains, planning to enter Anhui. The county repeatedly requested troops from the provincial government. The provincial government then consulted with Yue Shengxuan, the commander of the 57th Division, and sent Yan Heling's 139th Regiment to Dongliu to suppress the bandits as appropriate. However, on the 21st of last month, the Fang bandits had fled from Xiaojialing in Jiangxi to Longquanwan in Qiupu. The original security team in Longquanwan had more than 30 people. This time, because the bandits were outnumbered, the team leader Fan Zhanyuan and squad leader Liu Youzhang and team members Ding Shichun and Zhao Chunfang were all shot and killed. The bandits then occupied Longquanwan and planned to enter Chenjia Alley. The Chenjia Alley People's Self-Defense Corps tried their best to block them. Fortunately, Yan's regiment arrived in Qiupu and immediately advanced to attack. The bandits could not support themselves and retreated to Shimen Street and other places. At the beginning of this month, Yan's regiment was ordered to be transferred to defend against bandits. On the 4th night at 11 o'clock, the bandits took the opportunity to occupy Longquanwan and captured the Qiupu County seat. County Chief Du and representatives from all walks of life went to the provincial government to request assistance. Provincial Chairman Chen Tiaoyuan, who had just arrived in Anhui from Beijing, heard the news and immediately dispatched troops from the 55th Division to suppress the bandits. At 3 am on the 7th, Qiupu was recovered. The bandits were defeated and fled back to the mountains of Jiangxi. Although the bandits occupied the county for only three days, the local losses were enormous. County Chief Du has now joined forces with people from all walks of life to handle the aftermath.

<h3>Yan Xishan Returns to Wutai from Taiyuan</h3>
<p>Secret Talks with Shang Zhen in Huangzhai Before Leaving; Yan's Camp Office Has Been Closed, But the Jin Army's Transfer of Defenses Is Still Very Busy</p>
<p>A Taiyuan dispatch on the 5th reports that since Liang Ruzhou and Wen Shouquan, representatives sent by Yan to the Northeast, arrived in Shenyang, they have been reporting the progress of the consultations by telegram every day. Although the outside world cannot know the details, according to internal sources, Liang and Wen have visited Zhang several times and have negotiated considerable guarantees for Yan's safety in WeChat. Yan then decided to retire. At 9 am on the 4th, he left the headquarters and went straight back to his original residence in Hebian Village, Wutai. Reporters stationed in other places, believing that Yan had prepared to step down, telegraphed reports today. When the telegrams were sent to the liaison section of the camp for inspection, the staff of the section believed that this matter was of great importance and could not be decided. Later, the telegrams were sent to Hebian for Yan's personal review and asked whether the telegrams could be sent. Yan immediately approved the word "send" after reading the telegrams. It was not until the evening that the telegrams were taken back from Hebian. According to headquarters sources, Yan's return to his hometown this time was very secret in advance, and even his close associates did not know. Yan went to the provincial government alone at about 9 am this morning. At that time, Provincial Chairman Shang Zhen was talking with two representatives of the Chambers of Commerce of various counties on the financial meeting. Yan stepped forward and took Shang's hand and whispered, "Follow me." Shang followed Yan out and boarded Yan's No. 1 car. Shang's empty car followed behind the No. 1 car. All the attendants and bodyguards were not taken. Only the car driver and three people followed and immediately drove straight out of the North Gate. When they arrived near Huangzhai (about sixty miles from the city), Yan ordered the car to stop and went to a small hilltop with Shang. The two sat on the ground and had a secret talk for a long time before Yan took the car north. Shang also got in the car and returned to the city. Yan will not come back within the most recent period of his return to his hometown.</p>
<p>There have been several rumors about the military and political leaders after Yan's stepping down. Some say it will be Xu Yongchang and Yang Aiyuan, and some say it will be Zhao Daiwen or Shang Zhen. There are many discussions, and it is impossible to come to a conclusion. But since Fu Zuoyi suddenly came to Taiyuan, it is generally said that Fu will be the most promising in the future. In short, it is difficult to make a definite statement before the official announcement. After receiving Yan's order to rush to complete the closing, Zhang Zhijie, the director of the camp's office, believed that the aftermath issues were also very important. He drafted the plan and submitted it to Yan for approval. All group members with a monthly salary of more than 100 yuan were recorded as recommended positions, and those with a monthly salary of less than 100 yuan were recorded as county clerk positions. Interns are appointed by the various departments. The headquarters of the Special Party Department has ordered the first and second propaganda teams and the cavalry propaganda team to immediately stop their work and cancel the names of the teams. All party affairs workers of the various armies will first return to the training department to wait for further assignments.</p>
<p>After Yan Xishan issued the telegram of stepping down on the 4th, he went to Hebian Village to express no thorough statement on the future aftermath of the Jin army. The Jin army has been transferring defenses in recent days and is very busy. Defenses have been deployed in the east, south, and north of Jin Province, and it seems that they have not abandoned the plan to maintain the entire Jin army. Although a portion of Feng Pengzhu's troops stationed in Huolu on the Zhengtai Road have withdrawn from the Jingxing Niangziguan area, the 25th Division is still waiting for orders in Huolu and has not yet expressed a willingness to cede the defense. However, the former enemy headquarters of the Jin army has returned the reporters and telegraph machines that were used to call the former Hebei Telegraph Administration for cancellation orders.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Anti-Japanese Resistance of the People of Taiwan</h3>
<p>A Shantou dispatch reports that the people of Taiwan rose up to fight the Japanese this time, using the iron and blood of thousands of people to deal with the large Japanese army. Their spirit of sacrifice is truly admirable. However, most of the news about the beginning of this incident came from Japanese communication agencies, which are inevitably biased. I received a letter from Taiwan yesterday, which describes the cause and effect of this matter in great detail. I have recorded it below for the reference of readers.</p>
<p>Last year, the water of the Zhuoshui River in Taichung was clear for three days. The people of the whole island were quite bewildered, because the Zhuoshui River has never been clear. The elders said that when the water of the muddy river is clear, disaster will definitely occur, and the historical records are consistent with this. This spring, red rain suddenly fell near the area, covering an area of ​​six zhang long and wide. The people of Taiwan were even more surprised and believed that the coming of disaster was a sign from heaven. Unexpectedly, the change that occurred was a revolutionary war that had been suppressed for a long time. The cause of this matter was that the Taiwanese people, who were regarded as savages by the Japanese, numbered more than 130,000. Because of the different terrains and races, they were divided into hundreds of tribes. Usually, each tribe was treated unfairly by the local government and suffered greatly. However, they were afraid of the strict Japanese police system and dared not launch a revolt. There was a Taiwanese clan in Taichung Prefecture called Mengmai (transliteration), and their village was called Wushe. This tribe was the most civilized of the Taiwanese tribes. When the Japanese entered Taiwan, the tribe was the first to surrender. It is said that their bloodline is a mixture of Dutch and local aborigines. The population is about 2,000 people, and there are only more than 500 strong men. Most of the people in the tribe have received Japanese education and have good culture and knowledge. The eldest son of the tribe's leader, named Hanoka Ichiro, was a handsome young man with a fearless revolutionary spirit. He graduated from Taichung Normal School. After graduation, he originally planned to become a teacher so that he could use education to promote his revolutionary work. However, the Japanese government knew that he was talented and capable and did not allow him to change his position to become a policeman to manage the tribe. Since Hanaoka's ambition was not fulfilled, he turned to谋 other changes and conspired with the people in the tribe on a revolutionary plan, making organized and prepared launches. Everything was properly arranged, so they purchased food one month in advance and moved the children to other tribes a few days before the incident to avoid being trampled on. Thus, the war opened. It was found that the tribe cut off the traffic and telephone lines in various places on the 26th of last month, leaving only the most important ones uncut to hide the ears and eyes of the Japanese. On the 27th, it happened to be the joint sports meeting of various elementary schools in Wushe. All the police chiefs and students gathered. The tribe divided into two teams to attack, one team went to the police branch to cut off the phone and seize more than 150 guns, more than 50,000 bullets, and countless gunpowder. On that day, many Japanese police families were also killed, which shows the deep resentment of the Taiwanese people against the Japanese. One team drove to the sports field to attack. It is estimated that about 200 people were killed, all of whom were Japanese. Taiwanese and Han Chinese were not harmed. Their goals were clear. After the incident, the whole Taiwan was shocked, and the Japanese immediately dispatched troops to respond to the enemy. On the 28th, they began to dispatch police forces and troops from all over the country, totaling more than 2,000 people, and five planes arrived on the 31st to launch a general attack. The commander of the Japanese army was Kamata. Because the Taiwanese people of Wushe were fighting effectively, they could not be taken lightly. He moved his headquarters to the combat area, as serious as confronting an enemy country. In a fierce battle until the 2nd of this month, although the Japanese army occupied several mountain ridges of the other side, the dangerous places were still difficult to capture. The tribe's fighting skills were quite clever. They avoided the Japanese planes' bombing, hid during the day and went out at night, and were familiar with the path, either encircling or flanking, and were always victorious. Although the Japanese army had a large number of people, they were no match for them. Moreover, they were able to create a kind of firearm that was buried on the side of the road and tied the fire line to the center of the road. When the Japanese army passed through the area and accidentally touched the fire line, tens of thousands of crossbows were fired at the same time, and no one was spared. The Japanese army was once ambushed and suffered more than a dozen casualties. Because the tribe lived in the mountains and made a living by hunting, they were very accurate in firing guns and extremely fast in walking in the mountains. When competing with the Japanese army, the Japanese army sighed that they were not as good as them. Since this matter was transmitted to Tokyo, the Japanese government has attached great importance to it and specially sent Mr. Komae, the Director of the National Savage Bureau, to Taiwan to inspect the situation and bring two missions: 1. Do not deal with the enemy with the methods of hatred and revenge. 2. Punish criminal savages within the scope of the law. It is feared that once other tribes are mistakenly killed, it will provoke public outrage throughout Taiwan and cause the war to expand day by day, which is not a good strategy.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, on the 1st of this month, the Japanese army had mistakenly killed a member of another Taiwanese tribe, and the tribe was also angry and wanted to move. The Japanese were very afraid and immediately dispatched more than 30 troops and local police to suppress the situation. The situation is becoming more and more serious. Anyone who knows the situation in Taichung believes that this incident cannot be taken lightly, because the Taiwanese people deeply sympathize with the Wushe action. As for the rumors that the women of Wushe committed suicide to encourage their husbands and sons to fight to the death, it is a one-sided statement by the Japanese. It is heard that more than 100 women in the tribe were killed by the Japanese. The Japanese were afraid that people would say that they were indiscriminately killing people who had no resistance, so they blamed it on suicide. (November 8th)</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office Rectifies Tax Collection</h3>
<p>Former Yixing Finance Bureau Chief Performed Poorly, Province Requested Disciplinary Action According to Law</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office sent an official letter to the Provincial Government regarding the poor performance of Tan Xiangqi, the former Yixing Finance Bureau Chief, and current Taixing Finance Bureau Chief, requesting disciplinary action according to law. The letter reads: We have investigated the case of Tan Xiangqi, the former Yixing Finance Bureau Chief and current Taixing Finance Bureau Chief, who misappropriated over 32,200 yuan of provincial education funds during his tenure in Yixing. Successive chiefs have shifted responsibility, delaying resolution. We have repeatedly ordered and urged the current Finance Bureau Chief, Li Jianding, to work together to submit a telegram stating that the funds will be included in the local budget starting in the 20th year and repaid over three years. Currently, the provincial education funds rely on borrowed funds, creating incomparable difficulties. This autumn, the county has experienced a bountiful harvest, and the winter grain shipments are about to begin. If this large sum is not deducted and resolved during this peak collection period, but instead is deferred to the 20th year's budget for repayment over three years, this slow approach will not alleviate the urgent situation. We have instructed the bureau to reconvene a meeting and devise a plan to repay the full amount as quickly as possible, subject to review. We are concerned that this may not be followed. Chief Tan Xiangqi has already made mistakes in the past and has not thought to improve in the future. His transfer to the Taixing Finance Bureau has resulted in even worse performance. The report form submitted for the first ten days of May understated the amount of harvest tax collected by 167 taels, 6 mace, 2 fen, and 1 li. We discovered this and ordered a review, which he attributed to a clerical error. Taxes are of utmost importance, yet he seemed unaware of the oversight. How can he be held responsible? Previous chiefs in Taixing cleared taxes on a monthly basis. Since this chief took office, taxes have been in arrears for as many as seven months. Not only has he ignored repeated urgings, but he recently initiated a joint petition from various counties to defer the allocation of harvest tax funds until the end of the 19th year's settlement. How can the monthly expenses of the schools be met if they have to wait until the end of the year for disbursement? These absurd statements and the delayed resolution of the Yixing debt are consistent. The petition also states that other counties have not yet demarcated [funds], so where does this assertion come from? This is incomprehensible. All of the above demonstrates that the chief is trifling with important public affairs and disregarding provincial orders. The real situation cannot be concealed. Our office has the responsibility but not the authority to directly remove and punish. However, if such a negligent chief cannot be subject to disciplinary action according to the law, then taxes from each county can be withheld at will. Regulations would become mere formalities, and demarcation would be a waste of time. The shortfall in education revenue would be impossible to investigate, and there would be no need for office management. Would this not clearly violate the late Premier's clear instruction to protect independence? The seeds of disaster have been sown, and the issue persists. We must make this solemn declaration. In addition to informing the Department of Finance for reference, we also request your government to investigate. Please consider the extreme difficulties faced by provincial schools and provide effective assistance. Swiftly subject Chief Tan Xiangqi to disciplinary action, immediately remove him from office, and make a public announcement to deter others. This will ensure the proper use of funds for education and benefit the public. Sincerely, Niu Yongjian, to the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>

<h3>China Public School Disturbance, Hu Shih and Wang Yunwu Arrive to Urge Resumption of Classes</h3>
<p>Ma Junwu Returns from Japan</p>
<p>(National News Agency) The report that China Public School Principal Yu Youren arrived at the school on the 10th to maintain order was published in yesterday's paper. It is now known that the delegation organized by the "Welcoming Ma Faction" sealed off all the classrooms and the entire student body went on strike. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Welcoming Ma Faction Situation The members of the "Welcoming Ma Faction" at the school are mostly students from Guangdong and Guangxi. They elected representatives to form a delegation, which established an office in classroom number 8. They have used over 700 yuan in student association fees and organized a disciplinary team to post slogans and distribute flyers to implement a forceful resolution. Most students are intimidated by them, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out. The "Welcoming Yu Faction" is trying to avoid conflict with the delegation. The two sides have exchanged flyers and posters and have had several scuffles, which were resolved by the military police without any major injuries.</p>
<p>Zhang Yaoguang Arrested Zhang Yaoguang is the leader of the delegation and the closest student to Professor Luo Longji. When Luo Longji was arrested, Zhang personally escorted him to the car. Zhang then learned that he was also on the list of those to be arrested and went into hiding in Shanghai. Later, when Luo Longji was released on bail and returned to the school, Zhang also returned to Songjiang to work actively. However, in July of this year, he was arrested by the Seventh District Detective Squad of the Public Security Bureau and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He has not yet been released. The reason for Zhang Yaoguang's arrest is that he is in charge of the Nationalist faction at the school.</p>
<p>Welcoming Yu Faction Situation The "Welcoming Yu Faction" is sympathetic to the general student body. However, because the school authorities protect the "Welcoming Ma Faction" and suppress the "Welcoming Yu Faction", it is unable to conduct its activities as openly as the "Welcoming Ma Faction". Its true strength is difficult to determine. However, based on the situation when Mr. Yu arrived at the school to maintain order, it is known that everyone except for 30 to 40 members of the "Welcoming Ma Faction" welcomed Mr. Yu. Previously, the "Welcoming Ma Faction" spread the rumor that Mr. Yu would never come to the school and that the board of directors was using Mr. Yu as a transitional figure behind the scenes, so they temporarily kept silent. Later, seeing that Mr. Yu was indeed willing to come to the school to maintain order, the atmosphere changed. They are now eagerly hoping that Mr. Yu will return to the school after the Fourth Plenary Session and officially take office.</p>
<p>League of Allies Representation The League of Allies is an organization within the "Welcoming Yu Faction". This time, the welcoming of Mr. Yu was initiated by the League. The other night, they sent representatives to Mr. Yu to express their views. Mr. Yu said that he had to attend the Fourth Plenary Session and would handle the matter after it closed. Currently, members of the League of Allies are remaining calm and awaiting Mr. Yu's return to the school for his disposition.</p>
<p>School Suddenly Goes on Strike After Mr. Yu arrived at the school and expressed his responsibility, all the students were relieved. Seeing that the situation was turning against them, the "Welcoming Ma Faction" plotted a final show of force. The other day, Wang Hongshi (Director of General Affairs) handed over the keys to the delegation, which sealed off all the classrooms and forced the students to go on strike. The professors were unaware of this beforehand and arrived at the school carrying their briefcases. Seeing the situation, they all left carrying their briefcases.</p>
<p>Ma Did Not Arrive at School Yesterday The report that Ma Junwu returned to Shanghai the other day was published in yesterday's paper. After hearing the news, the school's delegation sent out several notices overnight, saying that Mr. Ma was scheduled to arrive at the school at 10 AM yesterday and that the students were to gather at the main parade ground at 9 AM to go to the Paotaiwan train station to welcome him. However, they suddenly received a verbal notice from Mr. Ma saying that he had just returned from overseas and was extremely tired and unable to arrive as scheduled. The delegation immediately issued an emergency notice to dismiss the students. It is said that around 4 PM, Hu Shih and Wang Yunwu arrived at the school and reported that the students must resume classes immediately and that the principal matter would be resolved by the board of directors.</p>
<p>Hu Shih and Wang Yunwu Arrive at School to Give a Speech Another message states that after Ma Junwu arrived in Shanghai, representatives of the China Public School earnestly requested that he return to the school to preside over affairs. Mr. Ma originally intended to arrive at the school at 4 PM on the 12th, but was unable to do so due to his poor health. He entrusted Hu Shih and Wang Yunwu to bring a personal letter to the school to persuade the students to resume classes and await the board of directors' resolution. Students inside and outside the school were covered with posters welcoming Principal Ma and high-hanging welcome flags. At 3 PM, they gathered at the main parade ground and went to the Wusong River bank to welcome him. When the car arrived at the river bank, all the students set off firecrackers and clapped, cheering loudly. Hu Shih and Wang Yunwu got out of the car and explained that Mr. Ma could not arrive because of his poor health. The students immediately asked Hu and Wang to come to the school to give a speech. Hu Shih said that Mr. Ma could not return to the school because of his poor health. I represent Mr. Ma in apologizing to you and, in my capacity as a member of the board of directors, I would like to say a few words to you. Mr. Ma has a letter for me to bring to persuade you to resume classes and await the board of directors' resolution. That's also what I mean. I like your warm welcome of Mr. Ma very much. When I was president, I never received such a warm welcome from students. I am very jealous of your enthusiasm for Mr. Ma, but at the same time I am very happy because China Public School has such a president who can make me jealous, and that is the best thing. I will definitely tell all the directors about your enthusiasm for welcoming Mr. Ma. I will definitely help you with your request for Mr. Ma to return to his post. But now that you are on strike to await resolution, the loss is too great. I think it is better to wait while attending classes. If waiting while attending classes still does not solve the problem, then it is not too late to think of a solution. After Hu's speech, he asked the students for their opinions on the spot. Most of the students advocated for a strike to await resolution. Only after Hu repeatedly persuaded them did they temporarily agree to resume classes to await resolution. Finally, Wang Yunwu gave a speech that was roughly the same as Hu's.</p>
<p>Ma Junwu's Letter to All Students of China Public School To all students of China Public School: I am extremely grateful for your welcome upon my arrival in Shanghai yesterday. I am also grateful to know from your letters that the students hope that Junwu will come to the school immediately. Junwu also very much wants to meet with you, but recently returned and all issues are still under consideration, so it is not convenient to speak at this time. However, I sincerely hope that all students will resume classes immediately to avoid great losses in their studies. As for the school's problems, you should wait patiently for the board of directors to resolve them. I deeply hope that all students will understand this intention. Ma Junwu, October 12</p>

<h3>Basketball Star Zhao Renming Passes Away</h3>
<p>The Sports Community Mourns Together, Memorial Game to Be Held</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao Renming, the eldest son of Zhao Jiechu, a Shanghai tea merchant, graduated from Fudan University in 1924. He was known for his integrity, cheerful disposition, and elegance. He studied diligently while at school and was consistently at the top of his class. He excelled in sports, especially basketball. He served as the basketball representative of the Youth Association, the birthplace of Shanghai basketball talent, the basketball representative of the middle school, and the captain of the Fudan University basketball team, which won the Jiangnan University championship in 1924. In 1924, he was the captain of the East China basketball team that attended the Third National Games in Wuchang. He was a member of the Quanbai team, which won the Shanghai Basketball Championship for two consecutive years from 1923 to 1925, and a member of the Qingguang team, which won the Shanghai Championship in 1928. Unfortunately, he passed away from typhoid fever at Longhua Hospital at 6 PM on the 8th of this month. Mr. Zhao was known for his wide circle of friends and amiable personality. The sports community was saddened and grieved by the news of his death. It is said that his close friend, Mr. Tan, plans to gather famous basketball players in Shanghai and hold a grand competition with the Qingnianhui team (which had the best record last year) or other teams of comparable strength. All proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to charity in memory of their late friend. In life, Mr. Zhao was friendly to famous basketball players in the basketball community and there will be no shortage of supporters for this event. Although this event is an unprecedented innovation in the Shanghai sports community, it is also a means of raising money at a time when there are widespread disaster victims, and Mr. Zhao can rest in peace in the afterlife knowing that this occurred.</p>
<h3>Municipal Elementary School Joint Sports Meet Day One</h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the opening of the third joint sports meet for elementary schools in Shanghai. The weather cleared up after a long period of rain, and the athletes and spectators were refreshed. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>Each elementary school arrived one after another starting at 8:00 AM. The marching formation took some time, so the music started at 9:30 AM. The ceremony was conducted as usual. Director Xu Peihuang of the Education Bureau reported on the purpose of the meeting and the preparations. Then, a representative of the Municipal Party Committee, Mr. Tong Xingbai, gave a speech. Then, the sports meet song was sung, led by musician Zhong Zitong. After the marching formation, the sports began.</p>
<h3>Grand Marching Formation</h3>
<p>The number of people was over two thousand four hundred, arranged in order according to the symbols marked on the ground, which was quite neat and orderly. The position of general commander was held by Wang Huaiqi, and the sound of the order to mount and issue orders was like a thunderclap. The movements of the elementary school students were also very neat and lively, all of which were well trained.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu said, "Today is the opening day of the third joint sports meet for elementary schools in this city, and it is also the anniversary of the Premier's birthday. Now I will give a brief report on the significance of holding the sports meet today and the preparation process. The purpose of our party's program is to realize the Three People's Principles, and the realization of the Three People's Principles has the greatest significance for physical health, because physical health is the only way to strive to build a common construction so that the Three People's Principles of nation, democracy and people's livelihood can all be completely resolved. The Premier's writings and lectures during his lifetime often show the importance of physical education and the benefits of sports to our people. The joint elementary school sports meet of our city has begun in the previous and current sessions on the anniversary of the Premier's birth. The purpose is to let everyone commemorate the Premier's birthday and to let everyone practice the Premier's legacy of paying attention to physical education. In other words, the physique of the people of China today is far inferior to that of the ancients. The ancients were tall and big, and today's people are short and small. By the way, the Japanese people used to be short and small, but now they are gradually growing taller, and their spirit is also extremely full. This is clear evidence that sports can improve the body. Compared to the many children in front of me, I am afraid that they are not as good as Japanese elementary school students in terms of physique and spirit. Compared to European and American children, the difference is even greater. Therefore, the purpose of holding the joint elementary school sports meet is to cultivate the will to work hard to exercise one's physique, and secondly, to cultivate the spirit of unity. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that the 400 million compatriots of China are like a plate of broken sand, but how can we unite them? We must pay attention to training from an early age. We are putting thousands of elementary school students together to hold a sports meet for this purpose. Next is to cultivate rational competition. No matter what kind of business, solid unity and rational competition will lead to victory. All the world's powers pay attention to this point. I hope that the performances of each school are the true results of ordinary efforts, not the false results of temporary excitement. Winning certainly requires further progress, and even if you lose, you must continue to exercise and strive for future success. This is rational competition. As for the schools participating in this session, there are a total of eighty-four, including sixty-one municipal schools and twenty-three private schools. There are more than 890 male students participating in track and field, more than 410 female students participating in track and field, more than 2,410 people in the grand march, and about 150 group performances, with an estimated total of over 5,000 people. The sports are divided into three parts: track and field, gymnastics, and national martial arts. Each part of the judges is invited to be a physical education expert who has no relationship with each school to show fairness. In addition to the staff of this bureau and the sports field, the preparations before the event were also supported by various schools and people from all walks of life, which is deeply appreciated.</p>
<h3>Representative of the Municipal Party Committee Gives a Speech</h3>
<p>Tong Xingbai said, "Today is the first day of the third joint sports meet for elementary schools in the city. I will tell you what I know as a representative of the Municipal Party Committee. We know that physical education is not only about exercising the body, but is the foundation of all education. The development of physical education not only makes the body of each individual healthy, but also makes the body of the whole nation healthy. Various undertakings will also develop and progress accordingly. If the foundation is not strong, how can wisdom, morality and education be achieved? Today, what I want to say is about the following points. (1) We must know that exercising the body is a permanent effort, not a temporary attention. Every school commits the mistake of moving for a prize, not for exercising the body. When the sports meet is approaching, they rush to practice. When the sports meet is over, they abandon it. What is the point of being exposed to the sun for one day and freezing for ten days? 2. Physical education is extremely important, but other subjects should not be abandoned due to physical education. There are a few schools that treat athletes as a special class, giving them convenience in class and exams, and giving them preferential treatment in food, clothing and living. This method is very unreasonable. 3. I hope that the elementary school physical education in the city will be systematically and uniformly developed. Now there are many different clothing colors in the field. I think that in the future, it will always be unified. It is not only the uniformity of form, but also the practical aspects of physical education must be unified to form the entire elementary school physical education in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Guests Attending</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the guests attending the meeting included Zhu Yingpeng, a member of the Supervisory Committee of the Municipal Party Committee, as well as Zheng Xigu, Gu Zheng, Chen Zhang'e, Chen Jiaxuan, Chen Mengyu, Yu Yuanjue, Lu Lihua and dozens of others. More than 30,000 students from elementary schools and a large number of people from all walks of life came to visit, but the surrounding areas were already full of elementary school students and there was no room to stand.</p>
<h3>Selection of Awards</h3>
<p>In addition to more than a dozen woolen flags made by the conference itself and hundreds of medals of various colors, the awards that have been handed over to the conference and displayed on the stage include four large silver cups from Mayor Zhang and his wife, two silver shields from the Jingwu Physical Culture Association, a satin flag, a silver shield from the Municipal National Arts Museum, three satin flags from the MinGuo Daily News, a silver cup from the Xinwen Daily News, a velvet flag from the ShenBao Daily News, one vertical axis each for the men's and women's sections of the East Asia Sports School, two woolen flags from the China Sports School, a silver shield from Jinan University, and one velvet flag each from Zhu Yingpeng and Ma Chongkan, and a silver shield from Zheng Tan. A silver cup from the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, a silver shield from the Southeast Women's Physical Education School, a large flower ring from the Standard Sports Equipment Company, and ten woolen flags from the Brothers Store. It is said that the prizes from other institutions and individuals are still being rushed to produce.</p>
<h3>Group Gymnastics Performance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were a total of fifty-five group performances in the morning and afternoon. The most praised by the audience was the lively imitation ball exercises of the Wanzhu School, the natural and lovely singing expression of the Tangwan School's exercise imitations, and the brilliant and harmonious movements of the Chengzhong Affiliated Elementary School. But the score is lower to determine the merits of the team must be judged by gymnastics staff.</p>
<h3>Track and Field Competition</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the grand assembly of two thousand several hundred people in the morning, entering and exiting the field took up much time. The track and field competition began around 11 a.m. The number of male and female students registered for each of the four running groups was quite large. Preliminary and semi-final rounds continued incessantly until sunset, resulting in the postponement of the 400-meter preliminary, 200-meter preliminary and semi-final, and 50-meter preliminary and semi-final. The events for which finals were completed were the female baseball throw and standing long jump, for Groups A, B, and C. Their results are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>China Electric Football Team vs. Newspaper Workers</h3>
<p>A Score of Three to Three</p>
<p>The friendship between the Huashang Electric Workers' Union and the press workers' union has always been known to be deep. To promote progress, the football teams of the two unions held a friendly match at the arsenal grounds yesterday for practice. The match started at 1 p.m. Both sides' athletes were brave and spirited, and an amiable and friendly atmosphere was particularly commendable. After a long battle, China Electric took the lead with a score of 2-1, concluding the first half. After a lemon break, the newspaper workers tried to counterattack, while the China Electric forwards and defenders acted as a unified force, demonstrating even greater strength, ultimately leading to a 2-1 victory for the newspaper workers in the second half. After the match, both teams drove to the China Electric club for light refreshments and then dispersed. It is said that the two unions plan to hold a friendly table tennis match next week.</p>
<h3>First Day of Jinda Autumn Sports Meet</h3>
<p>To Continue Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jinda University held its Autumn Sports Meet in commemoration of the Premier's birthday.

<h3>A Word of Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Long</p>
<p>Love in this world is not the exclusive privilege of married couples, just as being a married couple does not necessarily mean having love.</p>
<p>As long as terms like "prostitute" and "concubine" are not abolished, the mantra of gender equality cannot be truly proclaimed.</p>
<p>Life is like a riddle. If a prophet were to reveal everything, what interest would there be? Therefore, there are no true prophets in the world, nor will a prophet ever succeed.</p>
<p>A woman around the age of twenty can be considered the most adored by men. Therefore, during this period, a woman should carefully use her discerning eyes to choose a member of the opposite sex who values both affection and righteousness as a lifelong partner.</p>
<p>In the arena of love, men find a woman's desire to buy clothes the most daunting thing, while women find a man's proposal of marriage the most difficult to handle.</p>
<p>The most embarrassing moment for someone who likes to boast is when they are exposed.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen. If we can use one less foreign product, we will have fulfilled one more fraction of our responsibility to save the country.</p>
<p>Those who are ugly in appearance all know the art of adornment, while those who are morally depraved rarely know how to correct their ways. Therefore, the number of hypocritical people increases daily, while the number of honest people decreases daily.</p>
<p>Most young men and women can only see beauty and money, and lack the ability to examine talent and virtue. Therefore, happy marriages and healthy families are not common in society.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Ford Airplane Test Ride</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>This Ford airplane, coming from America via Europe and Russia to our country, has been warmly welcomed in Shenyang and Tianjin. With its soaring flight, the people of Shanghai have been paying attention to it. The plane also offered test flights to various sectors. The day before the opening of the Industry and Commerce Conference, the plane was specially arranged to carry a portion of the members to Beijing. Mr. Zhong Weicheng, President of the Jiaotong University Railway Management College in this city, was also one of the experts invited. He flew on the plane that day. Now that the Industry and Commerce Conference has come to a close and President Zhong has returned to Shanghai, the reporter visited him and he shared detailed information about his experience on the test flight. Here is a record of some of it to inform those who are concerned about air transport.</p>
<p>Appearance of the Plane The Ford airplane is larger than the ones used by the Shanghai-Chengdu Aviation. The Shanghai-Chengdu planes can only carry seven passengers, while this plane can carry up to sixteen. Furthermore, ordinary planes have only one engine, while the Ford has a large engine in the middle and one on each side. This setup not only increases the speed but also prevents the entire flight from being affected by the damage of one engine. The entire fuselage is made of metal and is extremely strong and beautiful. The wings are several feet long, and the fuselage is painted with various promotional designs.</p>
<p>Pre-flight Inspection One hour before the flight, a pilot comes to inspect whether the internal components are complete. After this inspection, one can feel more at ease, as any questions about the components will lead to the flight being suspended for repairs, rather than a rash departure.</p>
<p>The plane circles the field once and then soars into the wind.</p>
<p>What can be seen in the plane The seats in the plane are very spacious, divided into two rows with seven seats in each row. The seats are all backrest sofas, which are exceptionally comfortable. The windows are tightly closed, but one can still look out and overlook the earth. One can see a green field, the Yangtze River like a ribbon, and the railways like curved ink lines. Other people, animals, and livestock cannot be seen with the naked eye.</p>
<p>Giving out Cotton Wool Those who are experienced with aviation must carry cotton wool when flying. This is because the air pressure at high altitudes is lower. When descending from high altitudes, if cotton wool is not placed in the ears, the eardrums can be easily damaged by the excessively high air pressure in the lower regions. That day, President Zhong and others did not bring this item, so those experienced in this matter gave it to everyone on the spot, who regarded it as a precious gift. However, the plane flew very low that day, so even without this item, there would have been no major problems. The most interesting thing is that the sound of the engine is like thunder during the flight, so even those sitting next to each other cannot talk to each other, but can only make gestures with their hands.</p>
<p>Torrential Rain When arriving in Beijing and descending, the rain was pouring down, but people sitting on the plane did not feel it at first. After getting off the plane, the company used cars to transport the members to their residences, which was very thoughtful. Looking at the time, it took only one hour and twenty minutes on the way. Compared to the train, even an express train takes more than eight hours. How convenient it is!</p>
<p>Like Sitting in a Car Mr. Zhong also said that riding on an airplane is as comfortable as riding in a car. However, cars sometimes have bumps due to uneven roads, while airplanes are incomparably stable and absolutely safe. In the future, this industry will definitely have significant advancements, which can be said with certainty.</p>
<p>The Right in the Air According to the host of the Ford company, Mr. Ford himself is already a car king. He has recently invested tens of millions to focus on aviation and has his son manage it. His intention is to have his son be an air king. It is said that there will surely be accomplished people after those with great virtue, and one who follows in their father's footsteps is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Anticipation in Beijing Hundreds of people in Beijing have signed up to try out the plane, which shows that the people of our country have a considerable interest in it. However, the plane will only be available for people in Beijing to try after President Chiang comes to Shanghai to test it out and fly to Beijing. In short, Ford's visit this time has a great impact on air transport in our country.</p>
<h3>Medical Palace Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>During the Double Ninth Festival, while traveling in Changzhou, two or three close friends visited me. Lighting a lamp for a late-night conversation, one of the guests, who had just returned from Shanghai, told a recent story from the medical community. The story was extremely tragic yet also extremely amusing. I record it with my brush to reveal a glimpse of the darkness in the medical world and the dangers that those seeking passage through the maze of the sea face.</p>
<p>In the bustling Shanghai, countless people from Ningbo have become wealthy through business. A certain young man, the son of a wealthy merchant from Ningbo, was handsome and enjoyed a flamboyant lifestyle, frequently frolicking in brothels for pleasure. Extreme pleasure leads to sorrow, and he contracted a venereal disease, which is common. He secretly told his friend about his illness, and the friend, who had some medical knowledge, said that it was just a chancre, caused by uncleanliness, and not true syphilis. If treated early, the disease would be easily cured. However, the young man had grown up in a wealthy family, was accustomed to extravagance, and considered the disease to be in a critical area. He would spare no expense to cure it and aimed for a quick recovery to resume his former pleasures. He immediately sought treatment at a famous and expensive hospital. The doctor in the hospital asked him to undress and briefly examined him, nodding slightly, saying he knew. He then led the young man into a secret room, ordered him to lie on a couch, and administered anesthesia. The young man was unconscious for a while, and when he woke up, he saw heavy bandages below. He felt something was wrong and reached out to touch it, but the doctor warned him not to move rashly, as he had just undergone surgery. The young man's heart was still not at ease. That night, while lying in the hospital, he secretly reached into the blankets and carefully felt it with his hand, and was shocked and fainted. The thing between his legs was completely gone, having been castrated. The bird, the bird was gone, without wings, and placed in a glass bottle as an exhibit. Grieving intensely, he couldn't help but cry, but the attendant quickly stopped him, saying that it was not allowed by the hospital rules. When he recovered from his illness, he negotiated with the hospital, but the affairs officer angrily said, "Who told you to contract this disease? Keeping your life intact is already a virtue. Why do you complain?" The young man ultimately failed due to lack of power and gave up. However, he was the only son and had no descendants. His resentment can be imagined. Did the doctor recklessly perform castration as a form of surgery, intending to punish him for promiscuity? Is this any different from seizing a person's cow because it trespassed on their field? Isn't this technique extremely frightening?</p>
<h3>Record of the Star Late-Night Banquet</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Because Yanqiu, Shaolou, and others from the singing and opera troupe attached to the Star Film Company will soon be completing their contracts after coming from the south to perform, President Zhou Jianyun hosted a banquet at the company last night at one o'clock as a farewell dinner. He invited many guests to join as companions. Those who attended included Shaoqing, Huogong, Sheyu, Lü Gongzi, Bao, and your humble brother. From the opera world, there were Mr. and Mrs. Zhu Naigen, Mr. Luo Liangsheng, and Mr. Wang Shiyong (the owner of Chunfeng Hall). Even Mr. Chen Yanheng, who rarely socializes, graciously attended. From the acting world, there were Yanqiu, Shaolou, Miaoxiang, Ruian, and Tongsheng Wujie, along with the company's film stars, such as Zhengqiu, Yuanlong, Xiaoqiu, Tang Jie, Zhan Fei, and the playwright Hong Shen, creating a grand gathering. Yanqiu, Shaolou, and Miaoxiang arrived at the banquet from the Yage Collection at two o'clock. The host arranged for them to be seated. Zheng Jun and Xiaoqiu, who were sitting at the same table, were quite skilled at drumming and playing the qin. Now, seeing Mr. Chen Yanheng, Yanqiu, and Shaolou in attendance, they could not miss this opportunity to enjoy their wonderful performances. They incited President Jianyun to turn to Mr. Yanheng for assistance, and everyone echoed their support. Mr. Yanheng smiled and agreed, much to Xiaoqiu's delight. Tongshan played the drums while Yanqiu sang a section from "Fen River Bend" and Shaolou sang a section from "Zhuangyuan Pu." One was a unique expression of new tunes, while the other followed the styles of Uncle Yan, each with their own merits. By then, the clock struck four, and the guests began to bid farewell. There are four things about this banquet that must be highlighted: (1) Zhengqiu, Yanqiu, Shaolou, Tongshan, and Mr. Yanheng were at the same table and discussed the merits of new and old operas and films. Even those sitting far away were captivated. (2) Shaoqing and Miaoxiang were seated next to each other. The two gentlemen were of similar stature and had similar faces (especially the areas above the nose and teeth were most alike, although Shaoqing's mouth was slightly wider than Miaoxiang's). Those sitting at the same table could not help but carefully observe their expressions and tones to see if they were the same. (3) Yanqiu and Shaolou were attending the Yage Collection banquet. Jianyun was afraid that they would be late, so he specially asked Huogong to accompany them and urge them on. Yanqiu sings well as the female lead in "Qijie" [The Escort], and Shaolou is also good as the male lead in "Qijie" (Qin [Zhongyu] Dispatch). Those at the same table jokingly called Huogong a兼職jiecha, or part-time escort. (4) Shaolou and Xiaoqiu are both in their twenties, handsome and lively, and both rich in artistic talent. Now that they are working hard in old operas and films, the future is long. They will definitely be able to add a unique color to the art world in our country, so it seems appropriate to congratulate the two gentlemen in advance with this banquet.</p>
<h3>A Note on the "Jazz Singer" Tie</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lang</p>
<p>Within the past month, a new type of Western-style tie has become popular in Shanghai. This tie is produced by a company in New York and London and is specially designed for the promotion of the film "The Jazz Singer," released this year by the Warner Brothers film company. The colors are quite vibrant, and the quality is also high, with various musical notes and symbols woven into it to represent the film's title. Because of its artistic appeal, the general public is vying to purchase it, and it has become a trend in New York. When the film premiered at the largest theater in the area, the Roxy, sales were even stronger. It is said that they are also being sold in Shanghai when the film premieres at the Nanjing Theater, but the price is extremely high, around four yuan each. They are being sold through the Wing On Company. It is said that the film has many new advertising methods, and the tie advertisement is one of them. Others, such as aerial advertisements and cigarette advertisements, are also new, unique, and eye-catching, truly the latest advertising techniques.</p>

<h3>A Short Note on the San Francisco Chinatown (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Kang Kang</p>
<p>San Francisco is the transliteration of San Francisco. The Japanese call it Sang Kong, the Cantonese call it Big Port or, based on the name Golden Gate, Jinmen (Golden Gate). The language of [通欲 unclear] also calls it Old Jinshan (Old Gold Mountain). In fact, they are all the same place. Calling it Big Port is because the most overseas Chinese are here and it has the largest commerce, and Sacramento, the capital of California, is second, called Second Port. Calling it Old Jinshan is because in the early years, most of the overseas Chinese came for gold digging, so it was called Jinshan (Gold Mountain). Later, Nevada had gold mines and more overseas Chinese, so it was called New Jinshan, and this place was called Old Jinshan.</p>
<p>The Chinatown occupies about one-tenth of the city's area, near the commercial center and not far from the wharf, and is one of the earliest developed parts of the city. The current city population is about 750,000, and the number of overseas Chinese is less than 30,000, most of whom reside in Chinatown. It is about five or six streets wide and long, with trams running in the four directions. There are many narrow lanes on the left and right sides of the main streets, like Beijing's hutongs and Shanghai's longtang. It is said that before the earthquake in 1906, the roads were narrow and the houses were low, and the doors and walls were not uniform. After the reconstruction, it was slightly more organized. Generally, there are buildings of three or four floors. Except for the largest stores, the front is often a shop and the family lives in the back, as is the case in the interior. The upper two floors are apartments for rent, each with its own entrance. The municipal government of the Hong Kong and Shanghai concessions has strict regulations on building hygiene, and the circulation of sunlight and air, as well as the supply of water, fire, coal, and electricity, are all convenient.</p>
<p>The major stores in Chinatown are mostly on Grant Avenue, formerly known as Dupont Street. Antique art shops include Sheng Fa, Sheng Chang, Nanjing, and Beijing companies. Hotels include Shanghai Building, Republic Building, and Daguan Building. Restaurants include Xinghua Lou, Far East Lou, and Yihe Yuan. Theaters include Da Zhonghua and Da Wutai. In addition, there are grocery stores, gold and jewelry stores, fish markets, meat markets, fruit markets, and vegetable markets, all gathered here. There are also specially set up post office branches, telegraph office branches, and telephone office branches. Branches such as the Bank of East Asia and transportation companies are all managed by overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence (85)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Pilgrimage to Italy Diary</p>
<p>Rome, March 10, Day 8</p>
<p>Day Two - Colosseum - Arch of Constantine - Baths of Caracalla - Underground Church</p>
<p>After seeing the Arch of Constantine, I proposed:</p>
<p>"Let's go out of the city and see the underground catacombs first."</p>
<p>Everyone agreed, so we took a carriage and headed straight for Via Appia, out of the Porto Capina. Not far away was a large park dotted with palm trees and cypresses. Suddenly, it was quiet, with no cars, horses, or people. From the shade of the trees, we could see seven or eight young men and women gathered on the green lawn talking. There were no gray, square, or black houses. The horse walked in front, as if going up a mountain road, turning left and walking along the earthen mound on a dirt road. The flying gray dirt made the sweltering heat even more apparent. The heat was truly sweltering, making us dizzy. However, the archaeological temperament hidden in our hearts made us only have endless hope for the magical beauty of the ancients. Before long, the carriage stopped by the roadside on top of an earthen mound. A red and obvious ruin like a beehive stood, as silent as a devil's cave. We happily walked in, stroking the desolate remains under the dome and on the stone pillars, our bodies filled with a dismal divinity. Ah, this is the remains of the Baths of Caracalla, built in 217 AD.</p>
<p>Strange, truly strange. More than 1,700 years ago, Rome produced a strange emperor. If you want to add flattering words, he was a talented and creative emperor. If you want to scold him, he was a proud and extravagant tyrant. When he was happy, he built such a large building. No one can truly know why, and everyone can only say that this kind of expansive architecture was built because of Caracalla's extraordinarily extravagant ignorance. This bathhouse is extremely large, and although it is only a remaining ruin, one can still feel its overall spiritual power. From the parallel arched doors, the exquisitely carved stone pillars, and the remains, one can imagine the scene of 1,600 people bathing together. It is said that the layout of the golden house was precise, with the bathhouse in the center, exercise rooms on both sides, then competition grounds, and also libraries, dining rooms, and bedrooms. The building was 240 feet deep and 120 feet wide. Such a scale for a bathhouse is an unreasonable excess and luxury in ordinary life, but it can also serve as a symbol and memorial of Rome.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Price Exceeds Ninety Taels</h3>
<p>Market Sentiment Extremely Sharp Yesterday, the 12th, the state of the gold market was extremely sharp, with the upward trend intensifying and the trend being swift. However, there were no excessive fluctuations, with a daily range of only four taels. The exchange rate was slightly strong, and banks continued to sell without stopping. The market buying interest was strong. In the morning, Yuanmao Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Dachen, and other firms were actively buying, while Yufeng, Yongtai, Kangrun, Xieyu, Shunli, and others were selling. The morning saw a slight downward trend, probably due to the decline in overseas silver markets. Afterwards, the buyers surged because the forward dates were approaching, and those covering short positions were extremely short of funds. The items and hedging firms and speculators all rushed in. Furthermore, the central government's trial implementation of the ban on cash exports, limited to six months, has now expired. Therefore, the industry anticipates that the ban may be lifted. The market price suddenly broke through the 90-tael mark. At times, there were two- or three-tael fluctuations, and sentiment was elevated. Later, Dachen, Zhifeng Yong, and other firms continued to buy, resulting in a new high price since the forward contracts began, reaching 92 taels. Afterwards, sellers became active, sharply falling one or two taels. The final price was within 91 taels. However, due to the Wednesday market closing for foreign exchange, the spot price increased by 8 taels, 7 qian, and 5 [li].</p>
<p>Market sentiment gradually optimistic At the opening of the gold market for December yesterday, the 12th, was 588 taels and 9 qian, a slight increase of 2 qian (gross price transacted weakly around 9 taels). The price of British silver bars was slightly lower by 1/16, and the price of New York silver was also lower by 1/8, so the market sentiment was flat. Afterwards, Dalian Gang and other firms sold, causing the price to fall from 89 taels and 1 qian to 88 taels and 1 qian. It then rose by 2 taels to the 90-tael mark. Dachen, Yuanxing Yong, and hedging firms bought, and British gold seemed loose. Huabi sold gold for December at 171875, and Mitsui sold gold for January at 1725. The prices were first announced and not changed to 91 taels. Later, it was increased to 91 taels and 2 or 3 qian, and the internal situation was stable. Huabi Bank sold near-term Citibank at 38 yuan and 8125, and Huabi absorbed gold for December at 171875. Afterwards, there seemed to be more sellers in the market, and Zhengjin sold British gold for December at 171875 without tightening. Therefore, the market sentiment softened. Yuanmao Yong, Xieyu, Bingxing, and others sold off, and it fell below the 90-tael mark again. At 10:30, it was only 88 taels and 4 qian. Suddenly, other firms bought, and it turned upward again, but there was a 1-tael holdback. At 11:30, it broke through the 90-tael mark for the second time, but there were no changes in British gold. The market was calm. Yuanmao Yong, Zhifeng Yong, and hedging firms rose up to buy, and it stepped onto the cloud, rising two taels. At a little after 11:50, it reached 91 taels and 6 qian. Afterwards, it fluctuated up and down by 7 or 8 qian. At noon closing, it was 91 taels and 5 qian, and new long positions were made, reaching 91 taels and 8 or 9 qian. Suddenly, because Hengxing and other firms sold off, it fell by more than 1 tael to 90 taels and 1 or 2 qian. The market situation was unstable, and the listed price was still 623 taels and 4 qian, deducting 33 to 35 taels. At 12 noon, 32 taels.</p>
<p>New price found After-market opening was 90 taels and 9 qian (gross price around 91 taels). Afterwards, scattered positions were sold, and it fell to 89 taels and 9 qian. Dachen and Zhifeng Yong bought up to it once again. From one jump, it was two taels, up to three o’clock when it came the new price line, 92 taels. Just as that was happening, Wednesday’s exchange rate had no market and overseas Indian exchanges had no news either. After the product price and Zhifeng Yong, Yuanxing Yong et al suddenly sold up, so it was hard to stand and it went downstream once again, so by 4:00 it had dropped to 90 Taels. Then, somewhat moderately, it was slightly pulled up eight or nine coins. Up until 4:30 closing market, ninety taels and nine coins, comparing it to the day before was two taels three coins up. Finally, it was suppressed to ninety taels and five coins. Checking the largest price from the day was ninety-two taels, the smallest price was eighty-eight taels one coin, counting it there was three taels nine coins of up and down.

<h3>Exchange Rate Trends Show Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silver markets saw a slight decline, while exchange rates remained stable. The Kobe exchange rate remained unchanged. The HSBC listed exchange rates were the same as the reduced rates from the afternoon before. As for bank transaction prices, there was a slight tightening. The market was stable and firm in the morning, but then the gold market saw a setback and also loosened. By noon, the gold price had broken through 91 taels, and then tended to improve. As a result, compared to the previous day, British gold decreased by 0.0625, US dollars decreased by 0.125, and Japanese gold increased by half a point. In the afternoon, because it was Wednesday, as usual, there was no market. Chinese gold firms were still trading heavily. It is estimated that 150,000 to 160,000 pounds of British gold were traded, and the bank's willingness to sell was unremitting. Zhengjin was the main seller, disgorging what it had previously absorbed. Datong, Mitsui, Huabi, Shanghai, and others were also selling, but British firms rarely made transactions. Various banks traded tens of thousands of pounds with each other, and did business of more than 200,000 yuan with Citibank. Chinese firms reportedly bought 200,000 yuan. Banks such as Shanghai Huabi and Muga Li were selling, but Japanese gold transactions were very weak, which was due to the mismatch of hedging.</p>

However, except for 96, which fell back by 0.14 yuan, the rest continued to be slightly firm.</p>

<h3>No Improvement in Yarn, Cotton, and Silk Markets</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still weak. In fact, the sales of spot yarn are not strong, and the agents are very slack, resulting in a thicker bottom cargo. According to Japanese merchants' investigations, there are about 170,000 to 180,000 bales. With this huge amount of hoarding, the pressure on the market is increasing. Japanese merchants are hedging heavily in the distant months, and some manufacturers are taking a negative attitude and liquidating 2,000 to 3,000 bales of long positions. New lows were discovered in the previous market. At the close, Rongxinghao bought 1,700 bales in the current month, which was also entrusted by the manufacturer, and the market atmosphere slightly improved. In short, the bottom cargo is too thick, sales are not improving, and the future is still difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>The man-made fiber market is shaky. The opening price of man-made fiber in the previous market rose due to the rebound of American cotton, and the market sentiment was slightly tighter, rising by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. In the second and third 盘, a certain factory liquidated long positions, and the market sentiment suddenly loosened, with each month falling by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. In the afternoon, some long positions were bought in, rising slightly by 0.2 to 0.4 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 19,550 bales. It was found that Daji bought 1,050 bales, Dafeng 1,000 bales, Senkang 1,100 bales, Yuantai 1,250 bales, Gongtai 900 bales, and the rest 300 to 500 bales. Shenxin sold 2,500 bales, Dafu 1,200 bales, Yudai 2,200 bales, Tiancheng 800 bales, Dafeng 950 bales, and the rest 300 to 500 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Shows Slight Activity</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly firm, rising and falling suddenly, making it difficult to grasp. But in reality, there is still no development. The demand from various factories is sluggish. Only the long positions are tightening and unwilling to loosen because the source of Han cotton is very scarce. American cotton also fluctuates, so the market fluctuates. At present, it can only be held temporarily.</p>
<p>Han Cotton Rises by 0.025 Yuan: The opening price of Han cotton in the previous market rose because American cotton rose again, and people's hearts were slightly firmer, with each month rising by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon, Yucheng bought in, and it rose again by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 26,700 dan. It was found that Yongfeng bought 3,900 dan, Yucheng 4,200 dan, and the rest 800 to 900 dan. Maoji sold 1,500 dan, Yuanda 2,100 dan, Dachangcheng 1,600 dan, and the rest 600 to 700 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Han Cotton Closing Price Increase/Decrease Account Balance February 3200 Up 0.25 142,200 November 3220 Up 0.15 93,700 March 3215 Up 0.02 137,200 December 3210 Up 0.25 103,200 April 3225 Up 0.15 29,400 January 3195 Up 0.25 151,010</p>
<p>Cotton Demand Remains Quiet: The cotton business is unusually cold, and the factories have no way to handle it. The source is estimated to be 1,800 bales of Yao cotton and 500 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 33.25: Yufeng Factory entered 20 pieces of spot goods and sent them to the factory.</p>

<h3>Grain and River Lower Rice Prices Hover</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 30 domestic boats arrived at Zhabei, and sales were still acceptable. The situation of the new japonica rice varied because the concepts of buying and selling were different. Those who were greedy for entering the market were willing to loosen the price, and those who needed to sell urgently had to slightly lower the price. Therefore, the same goods had varying market prices with a difference of 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. The general trend has turned to a fixed high price. The current inventory of local shops is insufficient because they are bearish on the market. Therefore, the japonica rice market will turn into a hovering state in the future. The aroma of the Xian rice is relatively refreshing, and the goods are sold by customers, and the large market has risen slightly. The special grade is opened at 13 yuan. Although the Du rice is also tight and popular, the entry volume of each gang is limited, and the price is slightly firm, and the high opening is 13.35 yuan. The local rice is scarce and the transaction is flat, and the market is stable and rising by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The sale is mainly at high prices, and both the wine stomach and the rice stomach are selective in purchasing, with the top opening at 15.85 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 20 boats arrived in Shanghai South. The trend of each gang in the main street was different. The white japonica rice of Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places was initially shouted up due to the soaring influence of the North Market the day before yesterday, but the sales were not expanded, and the market presented mutual rejection. However, the price of the goods opened was determined by the means of buying and selling, with an increase or decrease of 0.2 yuan. The top grade here was about 15.1 yuan, and the Suzhou gang's high-grade goods also required about 14 yuan. The early and late rice of each place on the left and south roads also continued to arrive. Since the continuous decline, the goods merchants have become a major relationship and have turned to wait and see. Therefore, the top-grade goods are slightly firm, and the medium and second grade have turned to stability. The selling path of the Xian rice is tight for customer sales and stable for shop sales. The situation is about to rise. The afternoon has already mentioned the 0.1 yuan rise. The market is currently guarding the original market due to strong sales and stagnant sentiment.</p>
<h3>Customer Xian Rice Gang Rejected and Waited for Small</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Xian rice was still silent. Although sporadic small tickets continued to arrive, the sale was very dull. Although the Xiamen and Fuzhou gangs had appetite, they also took advantage of the situation to reject and wait for the Shanghai rice market to be bearish, and did not handle it in order to suppress the small market price before proceeding with the handling. Therefore, yesterday's market only had the local street to respond to about 400 bags of Nanjing machine-milled rice at a price of 10.01 to 0.03 yuan, and 100 bags of Hunan machine-milled yuan rice at a price of 13.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Label Powder Near Flat and Yuan Weary</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the powder market, each month presented a near flat and yuan down trend. The quotation of foreign wheat fell by another 1 yuan, and the long positions turned silent. That is, the short codes of large and small manufacturers have been huge. If the price of foreign wheat continues to report small, the people's hearts will be frightened, and the collapse of the market will be even more severe. Therefore, recent transactions are less, the market trend is flat, and the distant future depends on how the factory will behave before there is an increase or decrease. As a result, this month and December are 0.025 yuan lower, January is unchanged, February is 0.005 yuan lower, March is 0.0125 yuan lower, and April is 0.075 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Raw Sugar White Sees Slight Decline Again</h3>
<p>New Zhang Diao Started but Not Opened</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market production area telegram reported that the current price of Cuban sugar was still 1.40625, and the price of New York futures sugar in December was 1.40, which was also unchanged compared to the previous telegram. The price in March next year was 1.53, up 0.02 yuan, May was 1.59, up 0.01 yuan, and September was 1.73, also up 0.02 yuan. The current price of Java sugar was 8.125, down 0.0125, and the price of futures sugar in November and December was 8.00, unchanged. The price in January next year was 8.00, also down 0.0125. The purchase sentiment for the guild's raw sugar white was still quiet, and the asking price was still 7 taels 7 mace and a half, and then there were slight transactions at 7 taels 7 mace 0.025 yuan. The transaction of medium sugar white on the 20th was slightly thin at 6 taels 8 mace. The entry and exit of Japanese sugar was also slack. The price of N mark was up to 7 taels 7 mace, and the price of J mark was 8 taels, which was slightly lower than before. YRO mark was 7 taels 2 mace and a half, and YT mark was 7 taels 7 mace, which was stable due to lack of goods. The transaction of brand disk was also quiet. The Shanghai factory continued to open, with the price of Ren character opening at 10 taels 0.08 yuan and Gan character at 10 taels 0.07 yuan. The new Zhang Diao Qing was transported to 23 bags yesterday, but no samples have been seen yet, so it has not been opened.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Orchid Seed Market Price Rises Again</h3>
<p>Arrivals and Stocks are Scarce</p>
<p>The orchid seeds of the two rounds of Guangda and Taiyuan from Xiamen on the day before yesterday only totaled 41 pieces. According to the letter, the handling price has risen to 28 to 29 yuan, and the stocks are even more scarce. Therefore, it is difficult to harmonize the Shen standard for a while. This batch has been sampled yesterday. The goods are good, and the opening price was immediately opened. The higher price was 27 taels, and the second was 26 taels 6 mace, which was up 0.05 yuan from before. The market image was stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea European and American Silk Sales Are Difficult to Advance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign silk market was still difficult to advance. It was found that although the silk weaving factories in the New York market had started weaving spring silk, the price of Japanese silk was cheap, and the price transmitted by the Shanghai white factory was still difficult to rise. The actual sales in Lyon and Marseille were not moving, and the market sentiment was clear and firm. Only Lan Lebi and others entered 50 bags of Shanghai white factory silk, and Taihe and others entered 20 bags of white dry silk. The prices were firm.</p>
<h3>Gaozhuang Zhenmei's European Sales Move Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign tea market's Wuyuan Gaozhuang Zhenmei green tea's British and French trade routes were active. Jardine Matheson also had a small number of entries for Fenmei and Emei. Although transactions were not lonely, the selling prices were low. The Gongxi Green Tea Association continued to search for sales disks from 36 taels to 70 taels yesterday, which was unchanged from before. However, British and Russian firms had no entries for black tea such as Qining, and the market situation was even more deserted.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Fellow Representatives, Fellow Comrades, today is the 65th anniversary of the Prime Minister's birth. In 1766, the Prime Minister was born in Cuiheng Village, Xiangshan County, Guangdong. For the sixty years that followed, he devoted himself entirely to saving China and the world. (Omission) There are many great aspects of the Prime Minister's life. Now, I would like to discuss two points with you. First, the Three Principles of the People, invented by the Prime Minister. As we know, the Three Principles of the People encompass nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. Nationalism not only seeks freedom and equality for one's own nation but also strives for the freedom and equality of all small and weak nations in the world. Therefore, the goal of nationalism is to save international freedom and equality. After the implementation of democracy, the people have political power, including the rights to elect, recall, initiate, and referendum. Except for warlords, corrupt officials, reactionaries, and the like, all are entitled to participate in political power. It is evident that democracy seeks political freedom and equality. The Principle of People's Livelihood is divided into two aspects: equalization of land ownership and regulation of capital. The Prime Minister believed that China's objective environment was suitable for this approach and that, starting from these two methods, the goal of abolishing private property could gradually be achieved. The outline of the Three Principles of the People is so, and its greatness and profoundness are already evident. However, some idle people and scholars are arrogant and give speeches everywhere, but their arguments are not worthy of understanding the Prime Minister's Three Principles of the People and have become meaningless. Their so-called nationalism is simply to resist foreign powers and eliminate internal traitors, that is, nationalism, and at best, it is nothing more than imperialism. Can China embark on this path that others have already taken wrongly? I think you representatives understand very well, and I don't need to talk about it much. Apart from this small group of nationalists, there are also the so-called Chinese Communist bandits. The error of communism itself has been clearly refuted by the Prime Minister. However, the general Chinese Communist bandits, subsidized by Soviet rubles, act lawlessly and wreak havoc in our country's rural areas, killing, arsoning, and doing everything. They simply don't deserve to be called any ideology or revolution; they are just a bunch of local bullies, hooligans, and bandits. Therefore, China's political way out lies only in believing in the Three Principles of the People, implementing the Three Principles of the People, and realizing a new society of the people, by the people, and for the people. Second, commemorating the Prime Minister's forty years of revolutionary spirit. Since the age of twenty, the Prime Minister has strived for revolution, suffered for revolution, and gone into exile countless times. He initiated uprisings and failed countless times. Did the Prime Minister lose heart? Not only did the Prime Minister not lose heart, but he also mustered courage to work hard and struggle. His spirit of forty years as one day is so worthy of our belief and admiration. However, nowadays, the general public and comrades often become negative at the slightest setback and even more disheartened at the slightest disappointment. This kind of weak will and lack of patience is a manifestation of a shallow understanding of the revolution. Today, Nanjing is holding the Fourth Plenary Session, and all construction policies are waiting to be determined and implemented. I hope that all representatives and comrades will deeply recognize their past weaknesses, strive hard, take the Prime Minister's doctrine as the center of my thoughts, and encourage ourselves to move forward with the Prime Minister's spirit of struggle. Then, today, our commemoration of the Prime Minister's birthday will not let the Prime Minister's birthday down. The report is finished.</p>

With the birth of the Prime Minister, the Republic of China was born, which also influenced the revolutionary spirit of all small and weak nations in the world. Our commemoration of the Prime Minister is not only a formal celebration, but also requires us to work hard according to the Prime Minister's teachings.

<h3>Celebrations by Various Organizations</h3>
<p>Garrison Headquarters: The Songhu Garrison Headquarters held a Prime Minister's Birthday Commemoration at 9 a.m. yesterday. All staff members attended, with Commander Tai as the chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman delivered a speech, roughly stating that, whether during Commemoration Week or other anniversaries, we cannot simply go through the motions and consider it done. We must review the Prime Minister's personality and career to deepen our impression. My personal feeling today is that the so-called Prime Minister's revolution had its background and was needed by the times, so it was able to succeed. This statement is not entirely true. The Chinese revolution certainly had spatial and temporal backgrounds. Spatially, countries such as the Jews, Korea, and India also had this background. Temporally, after China was occupied by the Manchus, it was invaded by the great powers, and the need for revolution existed even before the Prime Minister was born. However, the Chinese revolution could only be realized and succeed with the Prime Minister. The reason why the Prime Minister was the Prime Minister was different from others. In my opinion, the reason why the Prime Minister was able to advocate revolution and succeed lies in three points: (1) a spirit of sacrifice; (2) a sense of responsibility; and (3) studying. The speech lasted two hours and adjourned at 11 a.m.</p>
<p>The Navy Fleet: Yesterday, the captains of the naval vessels stationed at Gaochang Temple, including Hai Rong, Chu You, Chu Qian, Chu Tai, Jiang Yuan, Jiang Zhen, Yong Sui, Lian Jing, Jing An, Yu Zhang, Gong Sheng, Yong Sheng, Yi Sheng, Hu Sun, Gan Lu, Hai Gu, etc., were ordered by Chen Shaokuan, Acting Minister of the Navy, to gather on the deck of the Hai Rong Cruiser at 8 a.m. yesterday to hold an enlarged Prime Minister's Birthday Commemoration Meeting. Several hundred officers and soldiers from various vessels attended. Chen Shaokuan chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, the Chairman reported on the significance of commemorating the Prime Minister's birthday and how the military should follow the Prime Minister's spirit of fearlessness and perseverance to fulfill the Navy's mission for the Party. The tone was passionate, and after the speech, slogans were cheered, and photos were taken. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Navy Reorganization Office: The Navy Reorganization Office, together with the Training Fleet Headquarters and the Navy Special Party Headquarters, held a Prime Minister's Birthday Commemoration at 10 a.m. yesterday. Dozens of personnel from the three offices attended, with Chen Xunyong, Commander of the Training Fleet, as the chairman. Cai Linbing of the Navy Special Party Headquarters reported on the significance of the commemoration. The ceremony was completed at 12 p.m., and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Two Railways Party Headquarters: The Executive Committee of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Special Party Headquarters held a celebration meeting yesterday morning at 10 a.m. at the Tiantong'an Station to commemorate the 65th anniversary of the Prime Minister's birth. Present were representatives from the two Railways Administration, Standing Committee members of the First District Party Headquarters, staff members of the Labor Reorganization Committee, representatives from various trade unions of the McGin Road and Wusong factories, and staff members of the committee, totaling more than 70 people. After Chairman Wang Buqin performed the ceremony, the Chairman reported on the Prime Minister's lifelong struggle and the significance of commemorating the Prime Minister's birthday, hoping that comrades would emulate the Prime Minister's revolutionary spirit and revolutionary personality to fulfill the Prime Minister's unfinished aspirations. Wang Renzhou and Lian Ze then spoke successively. Finally, slogans were shouted, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Launching Ceremony of the Yixian Warship</h3>
<p>The central government sent Xiong Shihui as a representative to give a speech, and Sun Ke's daughter performed the bottle-breaking ceremony.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's alias is Yixian. The Prime Minister's birthday marks the implementation of the Prime Minister's naval plan and the continuation of construction. The Navy Department's newly built Yixian warship held a launching ceremony at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochang Temple yesterday. Mr. Sun Zhe-sheng, Minister of Railways, was specially invited to have his wife break the bottle, but as Mrs. Sun was slightly indisposed, her eight-year-old daughter represented her in the bottle-breaking ceremony. Details of the program and ship construction have been reported previously. The details of yesterday's launching are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Rostrum: The rostrum was erected in the middle of the naval Jiangnan Shipyard, facing the Huangpu River, in a square shape. On both sides were stands for guests, each in a rectangular shape. The three platforms were arranged in a U-shape. The top of the platform was covered with a reed shed, and a layer of oil paper was sandwiched inside to prevent wind and rain. Behind the platform and on both sides of the stands were wooden ladders. At the east entrance, the national flag of green, white, and red electric lights was brightly hung, shining brightly. The sides and back of the platform were also lined with reed sheds, while the front was surrounded by railings. In the center of the platform hung the Party and national flags and a portrait of the Prime Minister. Incense was burned in front, filling the hall with fragrance. The four walls were covered with various slogans and flags made by the Naval Special Party Headquarters. The Yixian warship was displayed in front of the platform, with the bow facing the Prime Minister's portrait. A champagne bottle was hung below, wrapped in green and white ribbons and inserted with two Party and national flags. The stern faced the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Details of the Launch: After the ceremony, the bottle-breaking ceremony was held by Sun Ke's daughter, Suiying. His wife, Chen Shuying, did not attend due to other matters and only sent a congratulatory message, which read: "November 12, the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, is the auspicious day of the Prime Minister's birth anniversary. The Yixian warship is completed today and will be launched for a trial run. Shuying is honored to attend the grand ceremony. I respectfully offer this message to congratulate: Science and technology advance, and its use is extensive. Railways spread on land, and aircraft fly in the sky. The vast sea, the giant ship embarks on a long journey. Holding this weapon, it travels thousands of miles. Transportation is established, and military preparedness is also managed. Heroes compete, and the waves reach the East Sea. Self-strengthening and consolidation require precision in weapons. There is a way to seek precision, and we must rise up and move forward. Learn from the masters, abandon our shortcomings, and seek illumination. We are pleased to celebrate the Prime Minister's birth on this auspicious day. The initial voyage of this ship coincides with the honored name. Breaking the bottle and testing the water, the sea surface is clear. The whole country rejoices and unifies into one. Consolidating our maritime defense is the first step. Spreading our national flag across the eight seas, the foundation of great harmony, the glory of the Chinese, I offer this eulogy to express my sincerity." Sun Ke's daughter standing at the bow, waiting for workers to remove the wooden piles from the bottom of the ship. It took about forty minutes before Miss Sun raised the champagne bottle and smashed it against the bow. The bottle broke, and champagne flowed straight down, filling the air with fragrance. At the same time, the ship slowly entered the water. The Naval Aviation Office dispatched two aircraft, Jiang Ou and Jiang Yi, at 3:30 p.m., to soar in the air and scatter small leaflets printed with colorful paper. The whole audience cheered, applauded, and thunderously applauded. Military music played in unison, and firecrackers sounded continuously. The lively scene was truly rare.</p>
<p>Participating Guests: Representatives from the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were represented by Xiong Shihui, Commander of the Songhu Garrison. The Executive Yuan sent Yuan Liang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, as a representative. Chen Shaokuan, Vice Minister of the Navy, Li Shijia, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Navy, and other naval commanders of the Second Fleet, Jiang Yuan, Chu You, Chu Qian, Chu Tai, Chu Guan, and Chu Tong, as well as ship captains and captains, and local gentry and businessmen, Yu Qiaqing, and other male and female guests, totaled more than three hundred people. Chen Shaokuan was the chairman, Shi Guoxian was the master of ceremonies, and Li Shijia, Ren Guangyu, Zheng Youyi, Ma Deji, and others were in charge of reception.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: After the ceremony, Chairman Chen Shaokuan delivered a speech, roughly stating: "Representatives from the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the Executive Yuan, distinguished guests, and naval generals, today is the day of the launching ceremony of the Yixian warship. We are honored to have you all come. This Yixian warship took eight months to build. It was originally completed earlier and could have been launched earlier, but because the ship is named Yixian, we had to wait until today, the Prime Minister's birthday, to hold the launching ceremony. This is also a way to commemorate the Prime Minister. Since the unification of the north and south by the National Government, the Navy has launched three new warships, Xianning, Yong Sui, and Minquan, but the ships are smaller. The Yixian is two or three times larger than the previous ships, and all the construction is the latest (details of the ship's construction omitted). From the experience of suppressing rebellion and suppressing the Communists in recent years, and to increase our self-defense capabilities against foreign countries, it is imperative to increase naval equipment. Therefore, even in this difficult financial situation, we still insist on advocating construction. The total construction cost of this ship is more than 2.8 million yuan. Although we don't have enough funds now, we will continue to work tirelessly to find ways to complete it. We hope to complete it by the early winter or late summer and autumn of next year, so that it can serve the people and serve the Party and the country in the future. Now that the rebels have been suppressed and the financial situation of the National Government should improve, we will naturally pay attention to various constructions. Naval construction should not lag behind. There will be new warships launched in the future, and we will still invite you all to participate. The Navy is the people's armed force. We hope that all representatives and guests will give us more guidance so that we can fulfill our duties."</p>
<p>Representative's Speech: After the Chairman's speech, Xiong Shihui, representative of the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, gave a speech, roughly stating: "Today is the 65th anniversary of the Prime Minister's birthday and the day of the launching of the new Yixian warship. I am honored to be here on behalf of the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Sixty-four years ago today was the day our Prime Minister was born. The Prime Minister fought for equality and freedom for the Chinese nation. What we have today is all thanks to the Prime Minister. Yesterday was the celebration of World Peace Day. To achieve true world peace, we must first seek our own freedom and equality. The Navy is a necessary facility. The Yixian warship has a displacement of only over 1,500 tons, but in times of financial difficulty, such construction is commendable for the efforts of the Navy comrades. I hope we will follow the Prime Minister's teachings and strive for the freedom and equality of the entire Chinese nation." Yuan Liang, representative of the Executive Yuan, then delivered a speech, saying: "Today is the launching of the Yixian warship. I am here on behalf of the Executive Yuan to participate and say a few words. At a time when maritime competition is most intense, the first thing is to revitalize the Navy. The first thing to revitalize the Navy is to build warships. The Chairman just reported that Yixian is the fourth warship to be launched sixteen years later, which shows the efforts of the Navy comrades. This ship is named Yixian. Yixian is the Prime Minister's alias. The Prime Minister had a great naval plan. Today's launching ceremony may be based on the meaning of the Prime Minister's great naval plan. Then today is not only the anniversary of the successful establishment of the new Navy, but also the anniversary of the beginning of the successful realization of the Prime Minister's great naval plan." (Sun Ke's representative's speech omitted due to length)</p>
<p>Chairman's Reply: After the Chairman's reply, Xi Chen Shaokuan delivered a reply, saying: "Distinguished representatives, distinguished guests, distinguished workers, and distinguished generals and soldiers, today, we are very grateful for the guidance and hopes of the representatives of the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the Executive Yuan, and we are gradually ashamed. From now on, the Navy will follow your teachings and work harder to live up to your expectations. We also have 120,000 points of sincerity in hoping that you will continue to give us more guidance and more support. (Omission) Our dear workers have been working day and night, which is commendable, but we must understand that the central government is in a difficult financial situation. We cannot always ask the central government for a large amount of funds to build the Navy, so the construction cost of Yixian is still the result of the hard work and savings of all the generals and soldiers this year, as well as the consolidation of several agencies and the sale of many obsolete ships." (Omission)</p>
<p>Yixian Construction: Keel laid on April 10, 1919; launched on November 12, 1919; completed in March 1920; value of 2.8 million yuan; manufactured by Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy.</p>
<p>Convention Slogans: Long live the Kuomintang of China! Long live the Republic of China! Long live the National Government! Long live the revolutionary Navy! Long live the Yixian warship!</p>

<h3>Public Works Bureau Decides to Ban Dog Racing Tracks Last Night</h3>
<p>Measures Temporarily Not Announced</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Works Bureau decided to close the dog racing tracks in the Settlement after a long discussion at its meeting last night. It is also heard that the measures for the ban have been decided, but they are unwilling to announce them for the time being. The anti-gambling movement in the Settlement was launched on August 8th. On that day, Fessenden, Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, sent a letter to Qu Laide, Chief of the Police of the Public Works Bureau, stating that the commercialized gambling in Shanghai was more extensive than in most cities of comparable size. Although dog racing tracks, horse racing tracks, and jai alai are not strictly protected, they are allowed to be established, and the gains and losses are enormous. The Chinese all say that such gambling is directly related to armed robbery, kidnapping, and theft. It is believed that such gambling does indeed have an impact on crime in Shanghai. The sending of this letter was the prelude to the anti-gambling campaign in the Settlement. Later, Chief of Police Qu Laide replied to Director-General Fessenden on August 22nd, denouncing the evils of gambling, saying that gambling is directly related to crime, and that wherever there are large-scale gambling dens, there will inevitably be many crimes. He also said that the scope of gambling in Shanghai is far greater than elsewhere, so unless this worst kind of harm is eradicated, such as illegal opium trade, gambling, and places of general promiscuity, crime in Shanghai will continue to increase. Therefore, he advocated exerting all the power of his office to ban all kinds of commercial or other gambling. As a result, the Settlement authorities actively carried out the anti-gambling movement, and banning dog racing tracks was a matter of utmost urgency. British Consul-General Brenan, Director-General of the Public Works Bureau Fessenden, and Chief of Police Qu Laide also met on the 3rd of this month to discuss not only banning dog racing tracks in the Settlement, but also completely prohibiting them. The Police Committee of the Public Works Bureau also agreed on the prohibition method on the 6th of this month and submitted it to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors of the Public Works Bureau held a meeting in the Director-General's office at 4:30 PM yesterday to discuss the matter until 7:40 PM, focusing on the issue of banning dog racing for three hours. Fessenden excused himself in advance. Regarding the content of the meeting, he said that the Board of Directors had made a special resolution not to announce a single word. However, according to reliable sources, this newspaper's reporter learned that the Board of Directors of the Public Works Bureau did indeed decide to ban dog racing last night. As for the date of implementation and the measures for the ban, the Public Works Bureau authorities are unwilling to announce them for the time being. It is faintly heard that the Public Works Bureau will notify the promoters of the dog racing tracks to stop dog racing gambling within a reasonable time limit. If they still do not comply after the deadline, the Public Works Bureau will take severe measures when necessary, such as withdrawing police protection, prohibiting traffic, and suing its operators and spectators.</p>

<h3>Central Committee Member of the Movement Arrives in Shanghai, To Give Public Lectures for Several Days</h3>
<p>Mr. Scherere (STOJSCHERER), a special representative of the Central Committee of the International Esperanto Movement, arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the Shanghai Maru the day before yesterday. Representatives from the Shanghai Esperanto Society were dispatched to the Huishan Wharf to welcome him. That evening, a banquet was held at the Tongxinglou Restaurant on Simalu, attended by more than 20 comrades and Esperanto scholars from various countries residing in Shanghai. During the banquet, Mr. Sun Yizhi, the chairman, delivered a welcoming speech, and the comrades present each gave a long speech. The banquet ended happily at 9:00 PM. It is reported that Mr. Scherere is proficient in English, German, French, and Italian and has written many books. This time, he is traveling around Europe and Asia and has been appointed by the Global Esperanto Association in Geneva, Switzerland, as a special representative to investigate the state of the Esperanto movement in various countries.

Anyone who loves Esperanto can go to listen to the lectures without the need for an admission ticket.</p>
<h3>Closing Accounts and Collecting Debts Difficult to Separate</h3>
<p>Since there is no way to decide on a business policy, how can one advance or retreat? The issue of hiring employees for the year-end closing of accounts, which is attracting social attention, has now been decided by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. It is proposed to change the general closing date to the day before the beginning of spring each year and submit it to the Bureau of Social Affairs for forwarding to the government for approval and filing. However, it is not yet certain whether the government will approve the request. Some time ago, Mr. Wang Yansong, a standing committee member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, reported on the progress of the Industrial and Commercial Conference at the Chamber of Commerce and mentioned the opinion of Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, who believed that closing accounts and collecting debts could be regarded as two separate issues. Year-end closing of accounts is fine, and collecting debts can be done at the convenience of the merchant, until the end of January or the end of February, without violating government orders or commercial conditions. It seems that this matter will be implemented by order of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. However, whether closing accounts and collecting debts can be separated into two is a matter of great importance to the business community. According to Yan E-sheng, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, his opinion is as follows: Although the old practice of closing accounts in our country's business community is divided into three periods, the relationship between the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival is still light. The most important thing is the year-end. As the saying goes, "Take a look at the Dragon Boat Festival, and pay back half at the Mid-Autumn Festival." By the end of the year, it must be cleared. This is why there is the term "year-end." However, the key to the year-end closing of accounts in stores is not in the internal "closing" but in the external "collecting." It must be that the closing after the debt collection is clear is the true closing. If the year-end is only closing but not collecting, two difficulties will inevitably occur in practice: First, after the year-end debt collection is completed, the shareholders can decide on the actual operating results of the current year and decide whether to expand, continue, or stop the business. If the year-end is only closing but not collecting, the shareholders can see a certain amount of profit in the ledger, but in fact, it is unknown whether there will be bad debts or bad debts or 20% or 30% discounts when collecting this account. Then, the business policy for the coming year will inevitably be impossible to decide. For example, Qian Zhong, the leader of all industries, closes accounts at the end of the year, but the collection of debts must be done by the end of January or the end of February. Then, how to operate during the period after the closing of accounts and before the collection of debts is a major issue that can be studied. Second, stores mostly dismiss or hire after the closing of accounts. On the employer's side, it can be decided to increase or decrease the number of employees based on the business policy for the coming year. On the employee's side, after the year-end handling of accounts is completed, whether it is dismissal or career change, the procedures can be handled clearly. If only the closing of accounts can be done but not the collection of debts at the end of the year, on the one hand, it is impossible to determine the increase or decrease of employees based on the overall business situation. On the other hand, if an employee is to be dismissed, if it is done at the time of the year-end closing of accounts, the accounts he has handled have not yet been collected. If the dismissal is done after the debt collection, the year-end has passed and it is not the time to do a closing. In short, the most important thing for the business community is that there must be a definite date for a practical closing every year. If the year-end can only close the internal accounts but cannot collect the external accounts, and can only "close" but not "bind," it will inevitably feel greatly inconvenient in business and will never be passable. The government should pay attention to this level.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Aid Xiao Meeting to Be Held</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Federation Sends Letter Requesting Joint Sponsorship from Various Organizations</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation received an official letter No. 136 from the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday, stating that everyone is of the same mind in assisting the Xiao case, and requesting your federation to organize a support association for the Xiao case, and the department will send personnel to attend and guide it. It also received an official letter from the Overseas Chinese Support Association in Shanghai, stating that Miss Xiao Xin'an of our clan was introduced by the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau and left her loving mother to cross the ocean. Unexpectedly, she was forcibly defiled by the Dutch beasts, the first and second officers of the ship. If this shame is not avenged, what country can there be? Your federation is most enthusiastic about this case, and our association worships and is deeply grateful. However, the Dutch authorities despise our country and have not yet made any statement. It is not only the shame of our clan, but also the shame of the entire Chinese nation. We hope that your federation will stand in the position of leading the people and win honor for our nation and express the resentment of the overseas Chinese. It is heard that the Overseas Chinese Federation, because the great righteousness lies in it, does not dare to lag behind others. It has sent a letter to various organizations today requesting joint sponsorship and convening of an all-sector conference to discuss ways to assist Xiao in avenging her shame and relieving the suffering of the Dutch community. However, there are many organizations in Shanghai and it is difficult to invite them all. If any enthusiastic organizations are willing to participate, please send a letter to the association at 12 Jiazi, Parker Road, which expresses its deep gratitude. A transcript of the original letter is as follows: "Respectfully, the news that Miss Xiao Xin'an, a female teacher from our country, was forcibly defiled by the Dutch first and second officers of the Java Company's ship Cibadak on her way to a priest in the south has spread, and the whole world is indignant. The Municipal Party Headquarters has also replied to our association to unanimously assist. This matter concerns the public, and we intend to request your federation to jointly sponsor the convening of an all-sector conference to discuss ways to assist Xiao in avenging her shame and relieving the suffering of the Dutch overseas Chinese community. The timing is urgent, and we respectfully request your approval as soon as possible so that we can send letters to convene within this week. We will be extremely grateful."</p>

<h3>Completion of Rice Industry Wharf Scheduled for This Month on the 15th</h3>
<p>The rice merchants of South Shanghai requested Zhu Zixiang, chairman of the Rice Merchants Association, and others to build a rice market wharf so that rice boats could dock in Shanghai. Chairman Zhu requested the authorities to allocate a rice boat wharf and reported the difficulties. However, due to the lack of a wharf to allocate, the Bureau of Social Affairs was requested this spring to quickly allocate a wharf. The Bureau of Social Affairs approved the allocation of the section from Xuejia浜 to Santai Wharf for the rice industry to build an exclusive wharf. A contract was signed with the concessions, and construction began this spring and has now been completed. Chairman Zhu and other leaders discussed and showed the construction drawings to the public. The section of Xuejia浜 is most suitable for berthing 400 to 500 rice boats and is very convenient for rice merchants and boat owners. It is now scheduled to be completed and open for berthing on the 15th of this month. The Bean and Rice Industry Rice Boat Wharf Management Office has invited various rice industry organizations and fellow traders to visit the site, and there will be a lot of excitement at that time.</p>

Q: One day, Carlo saw you and Chen Genwei committing adultery in the room? A: If we were in the room and there was such a thing, how could Carlo run into the room to see us?

<p>Chen Genwei's testimony: Carlo was originally a very poor person who came to me and said that 5,000 small photos could make a lot of money, so I told my friends to open a store, but he didn't settle the accounts well.

<h3>Russian Fails to Pay Wages, Relies on Force, and Shoots People</h3>
<p>Almost Inciting a Major Uproar, Russian Driver Still Dares to Lie</p>
<p>The Central Research Institute on Route Tenant de la Tour, Shanghai, is currently constructing a large-scale Western-style building. This project was contracted by a Russian named Lei, who then subcontracted it to another Russian, JOHN GOLDSTEIN, as the second-level contractor. This Russian then subcontracted it to a Chinese named Zhang Chongwei as the third-level contractor. All workers were hired by Zhang. Construction has been underway for several months and is nearing completion. The day before yesterday afternoon, a large group of workers demanded wages from Zhang. Zhang replied that the Russian had not yet paid. The workers then went to inquire with Lei, the first-level Russian contractor, who claimed to have already paid the second-level Russian contractor. The workers were extremely angry that the Russian had intentionally not paid. At around 5 p.m., the second-level Russian, accompanied by three other Russians, arrived in a car. The workers immediately demanded their wages from the Russian. Unexpectedly, the Russian and the three Russians who came with him each drew handguns. The workers, fearing an incident, did not argue. Zhang Chongwei, the third-level Chinese contractor, then went to the Sixth District Police Station to report the incident (at which time the Russian had already left) and file a report. Yesterday morning at 9:10 a.m., the third-level Russian returned to the site in a car. The workers again demanded their wages and surged forward. Unexpectedly, the Russian suddenly pulled a handgun from his pocket and struck the cook of the institute, Wang Asi, on the head, causing him to bleed profusely. The handgun was seized by the workers. The workers immediately hired a car, dragged the Russian into the car, and, along with Wang Asi, the accountant Cao Deming, and two workers, took them all to the Sixth District Police Station to request an investigation. The Russian driver of the car, seeing that the Russian had been taken to the Sixth District, immediately ran to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to falsely report that the Russian had been abducted to the Sixth District. The police chief, upon receiving the report, immediately went to the Sixth District to request that the Russian be brought to him for questioning. The district chief had already interrogated him and, because the Russian's Russian-made five-shot handgun was unlicensed and he had used live ammunition to beat and injure someone, refused to release him to the police chief. He then prepared a document and sent the Russian, the injured Wang Asi, the accountant Cao Deming, two workers, and the handgun to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>A Record of Yu Yahao's Banquet for the Bigamy Case</h3>
<p>Reporting the Abandonment Experience, Hoping for Assistance from All Sectors</p>
<p>The first instance of the Yu-Yang-Zhang bigamy case has already been judged. Yang Xuejiu's criminal part was sentenced by the court to ten months imprisonment with a four-year reprieve, while the appeal from Zhang Nai and others was rejected. Ms. Yu expressed her dissatisfaction and immediately submitted a document for appeal. However, the first appeal was rejected by the appellate court. Ms. Yu was unwilling to accept this, so yesterday afternoon, she held a banquet at the New New Restaurant, inviting forty or fifty people from the local press and academic circles. During the banquet, Ms. Yu's mother, Yu Qianfu, reported Zhang Nai's abandonment of her, hoping for assistance from all sectors to uphold justice. Ms. Yu also sat silently to one side, looking haggard and very different from before. Attorney Qian Ying then expressed his opinion, saying that Zhang Nai's crime had been judged under Article 329 of the Criminal Code. However, according to the agreement to recover the Mixed Court, Ms. Yu could appeal again, accusing Zhang Nai of three crimes: (1) bigamy, (2) abandonment, and (3) public insult. Proceeding in this way could save the situation; otherwise, the prosecutor could be asked to file a public prosecution. Former High Court President Peng Qi and Yu Qingtang, among others, stated that Ms. Yu's efforts would surely lead to a final victory, as justice is in people's hearts, and they would actively provide support. Finally, Wang Peizhen of Wu Ben Girls' High School proposed forming a support association for the Yu case, with a meeting to be convened at a later date. Ms. Yu then thanked everyone and reported that she would submit another appeal soon. The event ended at 3 p.m.</p>
<h3>Appeal in the Xintong Foreign Firm Debt Case Remanded for Retrial</h3>
<p>Whether the Comprador's Fundraising Shareholders are Liable Depends on the Date of Withdrawal and Borrowing. The Supreme Court Remands the Case to the High Court Branch for Further Trial Based on the Above Two Points.</p>
<p>Guo Buqin, Zhu Yingwei, and Cao Shaochen jointly established the Xintong Foreign Firm in the 14th year of the Republic, agreeing to a capital of 20,000 taels of silver, divided into ten shares, with Guo and Zhu each subscribing three shares and Cao subscribing four shares. During operations up to August of the following year, Cao's four shares were transferred to Zhu Yingwei with Huang Jinshen acting as intermediary. At that time, no public announcement was made, so the transfer of his shares was initially unknown to outsiders. Later, the foreign firm went bankrupt, owing 18,499 taels, 1 mace, 2 candareens, and 7 cash to three money houses, Taichang, Jichang, and Xinkang Changji. Because the three money houses were unaware of the share merger, they sued Guo, Zhu, and Cao in the former Provisional Court, requesting a joint order for repayment. At the conclusion of the trial, the plaintiff's request was granted. Zhu Yingwei, one of the defendants, was responsible for the debts borrowed by him, so had no objection to the judgement. Cao Shaochen stated that since his shares had already been transferred to Zhu, he was not obligated to bear any of the firm's debts. Guo Buqin also stated that the debts owed to the three money houses had been borrowed by Zhu and should be borne by Zhu alone, so there was no involvement for him. Based on these reasons, they hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Fan Gang to appeal to the former Upper Court. On April 18th of the year before last, the court ruled to revoke the original ruling regarding the order for Cao Shaochen to repay the debt according to his shares. Cao Shaochen was not responsible for repayment of debts for money houses Taichang. The appeal of Guo Buqin was dismissed as unreasonable. After receiving the judgment, Taichang expressed dissatisfaction with the second instance court's recognition that Cao Shaochen did not need to be held responsible for repaying the debt according to his shares, and wanted to appeal to the third instance. At that time, the three-instance system for lawsuits in the concession had not yet been implemented, so the matter remained unresolved. After the authorities reached an agreement with foreign groups on the trial level system, the three money houses hired lawyers Shen Yuesheng and Zhang Deqin to appeal to the Nanjing Supreme Court regarding Cao Shaochen's part, requesting that the respondent be ordered to bear his shares as in the first instance judgment. Under the examination of court president Li You, the situation in this case should be considered under: (1) Whether the firm's shareholders are naturally responsible for debts borrowed by the comprador Zhu Yingwei. (2) If the firm's shareholders should naturally be responsible, whether the appellant had withdrawn before borrowing the debt, and if the withdrawal was after the debt, whether the creditor had agreed with the transfer of debt. The original judgment has already concluded that Zhu Yingwei can certainly represent the Xintong Foreign Firm, borrowing debts, but for point two, there was no need to examine the tickets held by the involved parties, such as ledger accounts, etc, and examine whether borrowing was before or after August 15th of the Lunar calender, that Cao had transferred his stock to Zhu. The High Court said this was incorrect and had a reason for remanding for retrial, if the appellant's stock withdrawal was before the debt borrowing, should the creditor, Taichang, been consulted according to transfer debt regulation. Based on the above reasons, the judgement remanded the case to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for retrial. The High Court branch then notified lawyer Shen Yuesheng and Cao Shaochen, the resident of Yuanfeng Silk Factory in Furun Lane, Beijing Road, to attend the court. Court Director Hu, together with Judges Ye and Li, opened the court to re-examine the points instructed by the higher court. Because further investigation was still needed, the court announced that it would be adjourned to a later date for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Failure to Deliver Rubber on Time, Seeking Compensation of Over 40,000 Gold</h3>
<p>Defendant Raises the Issue of Subject of Litigation; the Company Should be Sued, Not the Individual</p>
<p>Li Guohua, the owner of Zhenhua Garden from Guangdong province, bought ten tons of rubber from Wu Rongchang of Xinji Company on Hankou Road. Li was in need of this material for manufacturing products, and they agreed on a price of 405 taels of silver per ton. They signed a contract for delivery in the months of May, June, and July. A deposit of 400 yuan was paid. However, Wu failed to deliver the goods on time. Li then had to purchase from other sources, and the price was surprisingly high. The ten tons of rubber cost him over 50,400 yuan. If Wu had not broken the contract, the cost would have been only 5,670 yuan. Now, he has suffered a loss of 44,730 yuan. In addition, the wages and food for the workers hired during May, June, and July also cost 4,023 yuan. Both of these amounts should be compensated by Wu. He appealed to Wu for resolution, but Wu ignored him. Li then hired a lawyer and sued in the Special District Local Court. The defendant was summoned yesterday and hired lawyers Shen Yuesheng and Zhang Deqin to appear in court, raising the issue of the subject of litigation. According to lawyer Shen, Wu Rongchang is the manager of Xinji Limited Company, which is a British company. This transaction was made by Wu on behalf of the company, not as an individual act. If there is a dispute, the plaintiff should negotiate with the company. It is inappropriate for the plaintiff to sue Li personally, and the court should first make an intermediate ruling. The plaintiff's lawyer also made a defense. The court official did not proceed with the case due to this issue and adjourned the session for further review.</p>
<h3>An Old Monk Kneels to Die</h3>
<p>Kowtows to Tram Driver, Hoping to be Run Over by the Tram</p>
<p>Tram number 213 of the Public Concession Tram Company, running from Yangshupu to Lujiiawan in the French Concession, was traveling south to north on the Bund at around 11:30 a.m. yesterday. As the tram approached the intersection of Beijing Road, the driver suddenly saw an old monk, about forty years old, with ragged clothes and a slight beard, kneeling in the middle of the track about ten feet away, facing the tram. The driver immediately braked upon seeing the monk kneeling in front. Unexpectedly, the monk kowtowed several times to the driver, saying, "Thank you, I am very grateful. Please hurry and run me over to kill me!" The driver was shocked and, fearing that he was mentally ill, immediately got out of the tram to check. A pedestrian also saw this and came forward to help the monk up, asking him why he was doing this. The monk remained silent, seeming to have a sorrowful secret that could not be told. Upon closer inspection, he did not appear to be mentally ill. The monk then walked aimlessly along the Bund, and the tram drove away. Later, fearing that he would throw himself into the river, the workers drove the monk to the back road. The audience was shocked.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Narcotics Found in Italian Ship</h3>
<p>190 Pounds of Heroin, Worth Over 250,000 Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, yesterday (11th), customs officers discovered 190 pounds of heroin, worth over 250,000 yuan, in the cargo unloaded from the Italian ship "Dilauna." If sold in the interior, the price would be doubled. This can truly be said to be one of the largest batches of imported narcotics seized in recent years. The ship arrived on Friday and docked at the Gonghexing Wharf. Customs had received prior information that a large quantity of narcotics had been secretly transported from Constantinople on the ship and instructed the inspectors to pay special attention to the ship's cargo. After thoroughly inspecting most of the cargo from Constantinople, they came across several boxes of candied fruit. Upon opening them, they found that each box of candied fruit contained several small packages of high-grade heroin. The packaging and labeling were completely identical to the candied fruit packaging, making it difficult to detect without close inspection. Therefore, all 36 boxes with the "candied fruit" label were transported to the customs examination room for detailed inspection. A total of 190 pounds were discovered. However, it is believed that this seizure is only a small portion of the narcotics smuggled from various ports in the Near East to Shanghai. The bill of lading for this candied fruit did not indicate the name or shop number of the consignee. No one went to customs to pay taxes and pick up the goods at the time. The insurer was not labeled on the packaging and transportation, so it is difficult to investigate the owner of the goods. It is also heard that the Hong Kong Customs was the first to receive the information.</p>

<h3>Bean Curd Ah Chang Chopped with Six Axes</h3>
<p>White-collar worker was murdered by others, seriously injured and life-threatening</p>
<p>The local white-collar worker nicknamed Bean Curd Ah Chang, aged 32, lives in Bailinan Road in western Shanghai. He used to work in a bean curd factory, but had been unemployed for many years. After becoming a follower of a certain leader, he became an associate of white-collar workers. In the area, he had a slight reputation. At about 5:30 a.m. the day before yesterday, Ah Chang left home and went to a small stove shop near the area (that is, in the middle of Bailinan Road) to drink tea. He had just sat down and was washing his face when a car suddenly drove to the entrance of the stove shop. The engine stopped and four strong men in long clothes jumped out of the car. One held a handgun and two others each held a sharp axe. One person walked into the stove shop and dragged Ah Chang out with all his might. Three people then rushed forward. One pressed the handgun against Ah Chang's head, threatening to shoot. The other two raised their sharp axes and chopped violently. Ah Chang immediately cried out in pain and fell to the ground, covered in blood. He was struck with an axe in the arm, hand, and shoulder. His buttocks and legs were also struck with three axes. He sustained a total of six injuries. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the murderers immediately got into the car and drove away. At that time, there were few people in the area. Only one or two people saw it, but they did not dare to speak out because the murderers were armed. Later, when his family found out, they immediately hired a car to take him to the Red Cross Hospital on Haigen Road for treatment. He was seriously injured and his life was in danger. It is said that all the murderers were known to Ah Chang (also white-collar workers). Because of helping others in the same group, they had accumulated deep grudges, so they seized the opportunity to avenge their old enemies and committed this heinous act.</p>
<h3>Huang Fengying, a Trafficked Woman on the Huaan Ship, Rescued Mid-Way</h3>
<p>Huang Fengying, a 17-year-old girl, is originally from Shimen, Zhejiang Province. She is quite beautiful. When she was nine years old, her biological mother died. Her father, because his resources were lacking, married Ji as his second wife. The new wife was very tyrannical. Fengying was punished with a whip if she slightly displeased her. She suffered all kinds of abuse in vain. In the spring of this year, Ji gave birth to a son, so Fengying was viewed as a thorn in her side. Last month, Ji secretly sold Fengying to someone without her husband's knowledge. When Fengying realized this, it was too late. She had no choice but to let him bring her to Shanghai and stay at the home of Zheng Wang, a woman from Changzhou, at No. 18, Jiangyuan Alley, Zhabei. Then, Zheng Wang, together with Hu Asi, a man from Anhui who lived at No. 18, Ankang Lane, Racecourse, and his wife, Hong, from Shaoxing, planned to sell Fengying to Fujian Province to prostitute her in brothels in the hope of a good price. So yesterday afternoon, the four of them went to Datong Pier in Nanshi together and hired a boat to cross to the side of the Huaan ship. While waiting for departure, Li Xiuting, a team member of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, boarded the ship for inspection. He saw that the group looked suspicious and immediately went forward to question them about their origins. They hesitated to answer. So he took them all back to the team. Xu, the chief captain, led the case for preliminary interrogation. Fengying confessed the previous situation and requested assistance. Zheng Wang and Hu Asi and his wife confessed that they planned to take Fengying to Fujian to sell her to brothels, etc. Since the case involved human trafficking, they prepared a document and sent the four men and women to the Third Section of the Municipal Security Bureau for a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>A traveler arrived at the Daxin Andong Hotel a few days ago, wearing a well-tailored Western suit. He checked into room 146 and identified himself as Wang Xinmin, a 31-year-old from Anhui in the academic community. After he checked in, the waiter saw that he was calm and didn't pay much attention. Until yesterday afternoon, when the waiter noticed that the Wang guest had not gotten up, he knocked on the door. After frantically knocking on the door, he didn't get any response. He heard a faint groan from inside the room, so he pried open the door and saw that Wang Xinmin's face was pale and he was barely breathing. He immediately called the Zhabei police station. Chinese detective Cui Jinchuan rushed to investigate and found three empty tranquilizer bottles next to him. It was known that he had taken poison. He was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment.

<h3>The Lawsuit Over the Zhou Miaogen Brothers' Inheritance</h3>
<p>Zhou Boyu, a local resident, was recently sued in the Special District Local Court by his nephews Zhou Miaogen and Zhou Miaosheng, who hired lawyer Ye Fikang, accusing him of seizing the inheritance of their grandfather Zhou Zhiliang, worth about two to three hundred thousand yuan, which caused the plaintiffs to have difficulty with food and clothing. The main points of the lawsuit were: The plaintiff's grandfather, Zhiliang, did not have any sons, so he recruited the plaintiff's father, Bingzhi, as his son-in-law to marry his eldest daughter. The plaintiff's biological mother was Zhiliang's daughter, that is, the first wife. Therefore, the funeral arrangements and wedding matters were all handled by Zhiliang, with his daughter and son-in-law coming forward. Later, the grandfather had a son, that is, the defendant, who was the second wife. All of the inherited property included: (1) Shanghai Xujiazhai old residence land, 6.02 percent. (2) Xujiazhai old house, three and a half rooms, and two city houses. (3) Xujiazhai new house land, two mu, nine bungalows, and four and a half mu of land, rented out twelve houses (land price 4,000 taels per mu). (4) Huade Road Nanlu next to the wall, one and a half mu (price 7,000 taels per mu). (5) The Mingyuan dog racing field, two and a half mu, has been sold by the defendant for 8,000 taels. (6) Huade Road Ningguo Road land, one and a half mu (price 500 taels per mu). (7) Xiwangjiazhai land, three mu, 21 bungalows (price 2,000 taels per mu). (8) Huade Road Gaolang Bridge land, one and a half mu (price 6,000 taels per mu). (9) Housheng Yarn Factory public house rear land, half a mu (price 3,000 taels). (10) Qianjiazhai land, eight points (price 800 yuan). (11) Xijiabang west land, one and a half mu (price 6,000 taels per mu). (12) Qinjianong land, one mu (price over 4,000 taels). (13) Wangjia Ancestral Hall front land, seven and a half mu, rear land, three and a half mu (price 11,000 taels). (14)</p>
<p>Jiu Tu land, 15 mu (price 15,000 yuan). (15) Baoshan County Yinhang Factory, Yanghang Factory, Jiangwan Factory, three pieces of land, about 20 mu (price 500 yuan per mu). Except for the first property, which was inhabited by the plaintiff, the rest were managed by the grandfather Zhiliang, and the income was divided equally between the two wives. Later, the father Bingzhi and the biological mother Zhou died. The funeral arrangements were all handled by the plaintiff and others in the name of the eldest wife. However, the defendant did not follow the intentions of the grandfather. The second to fifteenth properties were all managed by the defendant. After negotiation, the defendant insisted on being unreasonable and refused to agree. The defendant sold the fourth property without authorization and did not divide the proceeds equally. If he is allowed to manage it without urging, the property will be swallowed up. How can the legal rights of the plaintiff be guaranteed? Now the plaintiff is unemployed at home and has no food or clothing, so he has no choice but to file a lawsuit for relief, requesting the court to order the defendant to divide the property equally. The case was heard yesterday morning by Judge He Ji. The defendant did not attend. Judge He questioned the plaintiff and announced that the hearing would be adjourned to a later date for further investigation.</p>

<p>Wang Linxiang, a laborer from Jiangbei working on the road, had an altercation with Dong Hongjin, a laborer from Yong (Ningbo), over a debt of four small silver coins at noon on the 3rd of this month at the target range in northern Sichuan.

The details were reported in this newspaper the day before yesterday. Judge Ge Zhitian continued the trial in court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated the case and said that the police were prosecuting under Article 296 of the Criminal Law for injury causing death. According to the forensic examination, the deceased's stomach was three times larger than normal, making it prone to rupture upon impact. Wu Lifu, a fellow worker, testified that the defendant kicked the deceased in the waist three times, causing him to fall, vomit food, and become unable to speak. Although there was no loud argument between the two sides, the kick was not playful. The two had already argued at 8:00 AM that morning. Zhou Wanggui, another worker, testified that he had invited the deceased to work. He saw the defendant kick the deceased in the waist once, and he immediately shouted to stop him, but the defendant kicked him again. The deceased then fell to the ground without speaking and died after a while. Dong A'tu, the deceased's cousin, reported that the deceased had no previous illnesses and that his aunt was still in Yong (Ningbo) and had not yet come to Shanghai, requesting that the defendant be severely punished. The defendant insisted that he did not intentionally kill the deceased and asked for leniency. Judge Ge, after reviewing the evidence, appointed a lawyer to defend the defendant and ordered Wang Linxiang to be detained pending a scheduled sentencing.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor: Recently, I read in your newspaper's news column on November 9th about the meeting of the tenants of Qingyun Lane, in which it was stated that Xing Dingcheng went to Zhenqinji Real Estate Company on Sichuan Road on September 10th to discuss important matters with his friend Gu Wensheng.

<p>At the beginning of the invention of the Zhongling Printing Machine, the National Government specially awarded a five-year patent exemption and a one-year tax exemption this month. Now that the tax exemption period has expired, the customs office will collect a one-time tax on the export of machine-made foreign goods. Yesterday, Niu Zaikun, a representative from Sichuan, and other members visited the Shanghai Hanli Factory and saw that the factory was well-equipped and manufactured high-quality products.

The results of the review showed that this case should be handled by the Hanli Company by submitting the invention components to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for verification, and then encouraging it according to the special industry incentive method.</p>

<h3>Why Edison Said That Education in the Future Can Use Movies to Replace Books (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Dr. Wei Zhong</p>
<p>Frank Borzage has his own method. He directed the film "The River" and divided the entire film into three parts. Two parts have music but use subtitles instead of dialogue. The actor's body movements are arranged in such a way that their body movements reach the point where they are about to speak before the subtitles appear. Tomorrow we can check. I don't know how much knowledge this director has, but the films he directs can combine the actors' body movements with the subtitles in a relationship like biology, where there is body movement first and then speech. All speech comes from body movement. You can see it in the film. It's easier to see in Mary Duncan than in Charles Farrell.</p>
<p>The experience from the movie mentioned above can help you see that speech comes from the body. Then where do words come from? We use science to answer as follows: words come from speech. Books are nothing more than written words. Simply put, the relationship between speech, words, and books can be called words are words in the freezer, and books are words that have been chilled in the freezer. There is body first, then speech, then words, and then books. Without a body, there is no speech, without speech, there are no words, and without words, there are no books. Buying books is usually stealing, but the people who make books are people with a certain level of ability. They have to have a combined activity of the body before they can have a combined activity of the book. The words they speak become words and are then written into books. A book is one of the last parts. His words are the most complete expression of the body produced by the combination of his whole body from head to toe. The sum of body activities in the brain is the expression of the combined activity of the brain, which is speech. Without a brain, there is no speech. Because human beings have human brains, human beings have speech. Animal brains are not developed, so their speech is incomplete. But human speech is the expression of the center point of the whole. The combination of the whole is the brain. Without the whole, there is no brain, and if the whole is not put together, there is still no brain, according to science.</p>
<p>We have just used our movies to explain the origin of words, so we can now rely on this experience to explain what kind of perspective future education has on books.</p>
<p>You must not use other people's experiences or other people's thoughts unless you have your own experiences and your own thoughts. Replacing my own experiences and my own thoughts with other people's experiences and other people's thoughts is to kill my own experiences and my own thoughts.</p>
<p>In short, movies in the new education are long-lasting external stimuli. Movies combine things that are constantly moving. Why is the movie we are watching tomorrow called "The River"? Because it is a very moving movie. The most moving thing besides air is water. Tomorrow you can see how moving the water is flowing down from the high mountains of America.</p>
<p>Religious education gives you nouns, while scientific education gives you stimuli. It constantly stimulates you, not allowing you to doze off, not allowing you to be a Bodhisattva. Movies overthrow the people who are Bodhisattvas, the people who look down on the body. This is the greatest role of movies.</p>
<p>Look at the Chinese moralists and foreign believers. They all think that movies are external and inferior things. They think that they themselves are superior people and only want books. Only those inferior people will want external stimuli. They say, "You go to the cinema, it is much more important for us to go and buy books."</p>
<p>In fact, movies are compatible with the scientific perspective. When religious culture has not yet transitioned into scientific culture, movies can help us practice accepting external stimuli. Movies deliberately prepare people for external stimuli. If you are a bookworm of religious culture, you will not feel the external stimuli. Movies can make you feel the external stimuli and make you have to feel the external stimuli. This allows your body to gradually get the opportunity to practice receiving stimuli and gradually develop new brains, so that there will be a new culture in the future.</p>
<p>Our religious culture people will not look for stimuli. Movies can help us practice looking for them, and the stimuli of movies are easier to happen and help with the brain's revival because movies stimulate your senses – the senses (ears and eyes) that are closest to and most related to the brain. If the higher senses practice receiving stimuli first, then the nose, mouth, hands, feet, stomach, and genitals will follow. It is very dangerous if the ears and eyes are not active, but the nose, lungs, stomach, hands, feet, genitals, and other organs are active. Movies first give people's higher senses the practice of receiving stimuli, which is the beginning of giving people's whole body the practice of receiving stimuli. The whole body's failure to practice accepting external stimuli is equal to the brain's inability to feel stimuli. At this point, our lecture today is completely finished.</p>
<p>I hope that the people who are here listening to the lecture now will go to watch the movie tomorrow to prove what I just said about using movies to explain "the relationship between the body and speech." Do not watch the inferior parts of the movie first – men taking off their clothes and going into the water – these inferior stimuli are what ordinary people will not go into the water for. First, use the higher stimuli, first watch the higher parts, and then watch the inferior parts.</p>

<h3>The Bulletin Board Craze at Minli Middle School</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that Minli Middle School is an old-fashioned school. Students' thoughts and actions are strictly limited. The bulletin board craze that broke out last week is enough to prove everything.</p>
<p>The "Minli Bulletin Board" was the first to be launched in the school. The newspaper used interesting, lively text and news to bring back the students' adjustment of the boring school life. Of course, there was no possibility of overstepping the scope.</p>
<p>However, the newspaper suffered a sudden misfortune at the beginning of its publication. This may have been implicated by the "Gecko" that was published at the same time. "The articles published in the Gecko are a collection of completely abusive criticisms of the school." Both newspapers were torn down by the school authorities one hour after they were posted. However, the "Minli Bulletin Board" was checked by the Department of Military Training and was stamped with an approved publication stamp.</p>
<p>After being torn down, it went through the review and misunderstanding of many faculty members of the school, and several conclusions were reached.</p>
<p>(1) Bulletin boards are also one of the student movements. Student movements should be prohibited.</p>
<p>(2) The people behind the Gecko and Minli Bulletin Board must be investigated.</p>
<p>Because running the bulletin board is to preside over the student movement.</p>
<p>(3) There is a short article in the Minli Bulletin Board titled "The Sharpening of the Fierce Battle between Nationalist Literature and Proletarian Literature." Because (1) it talks about Proletarian Literature, it is suspected of being communist.</p>
<p>However, is the fact exactly the same as what they think? I think it is not difficult for readers to imagine.</p>
<p>May I ask if the dozens of bulletin boards published by Fudan University have all violated the ban on student movements? Should all the organizers be investigated? What's even more ridiculous is the suspicion of communism. Mentioning Proletarian Literature in order to promote Nationalist Literature is suspected of being communist. Then, isn't the "Pioneer Weekly" and "Era Youth" and other publications that mention Proletarian Literature every issue even more suspected of being communist?</p>
<p>The waves of the bulletin board craze are still rising one by one, but the organizers do not dare to use clear and upright theories to defend themselves. (Ke)</p>
