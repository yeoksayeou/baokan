<h3>遠東會印度選手訪問記（錢華自東京寄）</h3>
<p>印度體育事業正在發逹</p>
<p>足球網球最爲世上認識</p>
<p>第九届遠東運動大會中最足與吾人以深刻之印像者即印度選手之參加遠東運動會舉行八次參與比賽者始終仍爲中日菲三國此次印度破例赴會遠東民族對於體育之觀念將因之增加不少興味預科第十届以後遠東運動會參加之國數定必次第增一進也</p>
<p>此次印度選手團一行雖僅四人而精神一貫攷其成績均有可見所謂以少許勝人多許者印度選手團由莫克爾西氏率領（M　ker　i）莫爲印度哥爾哥太大學畢業生復在美國哈佛大學得有碩士學位現充哥爾哥太青年會體育部長及彭哥爾歐林克斯籃球恊會名譽秘書其餘三人爲正式選手而以哈密德氏爲隊長（A·Hamid)哈爲印度班沙布大學畢業生現年二十四歲爲印度第一流運動健將曾於一九二八年代表印度赴阿摩斯特頓參與世界運動大會雖未曾獲勝　在世界運動界中已漸露頭角近來成績更爲猛進一百二十碼高欄之成績爲十五秒八保持印度紀錄其次如百碼紀錄爲十秒正此次在大會參加高欄跳遠三級跳十項數種其次爲蘇頓君（M·Autton）年僅二十歲在敎會中學畢業參與百米二百米跳遠三級跳五項數種第三人爲由蕯夫（A·Yusuf）現年二十三歲亦爲印度哥爾哥大學畢業生跳高成績爲五呎十一吋印度紀錄之保持者在大會參加跳高高欄二種印度選手團最初寄寓於東京印度俱樂部自中菲兩國選手聨袂抵日後始移居明治神宫外苑之日本青年館與中日菲三國選手同居中國選手居第一第二層菲第三層日本及印度同居第四層記者于月之二十日特往訪問由莫克西氏接見莫氏體格魁偉捷英語異常純熟記者詢以印度體育現狀及關於女子體育事業種種茲略錄其談話如下</p>
<h3>印度體育事業</h3>
<p>莫氏之言曰印度今日之體育事業可謂正在蓬勃發逹之秋青年男女對各種運動莫不感有極育體大興味至各種團體則有體育恊會各種球類運動恊會等各中等以上學校對於田徑賽及球類運動之訓練異常認眞故近年以來印度體育事已有長足之進步印度選手曾一度參加阿摩斯得順之世界運動會遠東運動會尤極願加入者也</p>
<h3>女子體育近况</h3>
<p>印度女子之體育近日亦有特别之發展印度所最歡迎之運動即爲鈎球及籃球等此次大會本擬選拔代表參與表演比賽但因時間匆促且排球一項非印度女子所素習故不得來會殊爲憾時希望下屆大會定有印度女子一席地也</p>
<h3>印度網球足球</h3>
<p>印度青年對體育事業最感興味者厥爲足球及網球故足球隊之成績深爲世界人士所讚許遠東運動會足球一項向爲中國稱雄苟印度而能加入者定可與中國爭衡一時正不知鹿死誰手也此次定選派足球代表但因印度全國足球戰在五月中旬開始舉行故無法來日至網球一項印度能手極多惜此次均赴歐參與台維斯杯比賽不能來會一顯身手矣</p>
<h3>將經天津一遊</h3>
<p>莫氏旋謂大會閉幕後六月一二兩日在關西舉行國際運動會印度選手極願參加大約六月五日左右離日因在神戶尙須應當地印僑之歡迎會也離日後先至滬再北上赴天津一游然後返滬乘輪言莫氏談鋒甚健滔滔不絕又謂上海多種東西均極便宜生活程度較各國爲低誠古界之一片樂土也云云</p>
<h3>上海丸上瑣記（蒼寄）</h3>
<p>此次遠東運動會在日舉行已於二十四午開幕吾國人士及關係人物莫不準時趕到上海丸爲開幕前最後之一班茲將與大會有關之瑣聞（在船中者）略述於下</p>
<p>國術館已先行國術館代八人已先行赴日惟其主任張之江則乘上海丸記者見張氏據云八人因係敎師故不參加比賽惟觀賽而已</p>
<p>趙林擲圈由滬至長崎風平浪靜有若陸地旅行體育恊進會經濟委員林康侯趙晉卿亦同船偕往相約至甲板上作擲圈之戲加入戰團者計七人林趙興　極濃成績亦不後人結果趙君令郎創新紀錄計於一次擲中二十六分</p>
<p>林林之誤斯時船上之風頗大林康侯先入艙六人仍相繼擲圈忽一日本僕歐大呼曰（林君在不在）羣指林澤蒼曰在此相談頗久而林君不知所對後方悉實係林康侯致有此誤</p>
<p>不見許淑貞報上盛傳劃紀文將偕其夫人許淑珍乘上海丸赴日且聲明完全遊歷而無政治作用但劉夫婦未乘此船赴日吾等頗以未見許女士足部之裝飾爲憾也</p>
<p>許民輝加入乒乓蘇州東吳大學體育科科長許民輝亦偕往以中華乒乓隊艙位有餘且均係國人故加入該隊同住談笑風生不感寂寞</p>
<p>體恊會之經費此次中華體育自會赴日前經費本缺一萬餘元除足球比賽後獲六七千元所缺尙多除由經濟委員林康侯趙晋卿等分任外又由委屈用中君捐二千元是可見屈君熱心於體育之一股亦同船偕往也</p>
<p>響導之先峯國人赴日旅行或參觀等每得日本中華青年會之參助指導此次該會幹事馬伯援君竟亦同船中華乒乓隊敎練專函介紹故於船中即先期接洽沿途備承贊助一切也</p>
<p>分送赴會張之江及趙林諸君於長崎即下船乘火車趕赴大會之開幕禮中華乒乓隊則於神戶下船</p>

<h3>五花八門之茶話會徐心芹</h3>
<p>月之二十四日本市藝術界歡送大木子王濟遠氏歐遊舉行茶話會於華安八樓踞高臨下遊騁殊樂而會中趣事重重令人不可勝記長夜無俚因漫誌之</p>
<p>三個鐘頭茶會之前先行攝影因光暗故攝時甚緩主席小鶼謂佛青伯翔曰二位内行盍不前往帮忙又一人曰伯翔若動手拍攝則鏡頭連眼鏡爲三個令人究竟注目那一個呢闔座大噱</p>

<h3>威尼斯歸來周世勳</h3>
<p>相别已久的戲劇協社這次居然又在中央大會堂裏重逢了這是多麽的欣喜從舞台上那古色古香的威尼斯街道上使我看到一種新的興趣</p>
<p>據史籍上寫明着說沙翁生平的名作甚多（威尼斯商人）雖不能說是他中年時代的代表作然而從這本戲的描寫和一切批評起來確也可以算是他生平名作之一</p>
<p>我很佩服莎士比亞的寫述任何劇本他都能用他全副的力量去襯出一事一物即如這一本戲裏的猶太人簡直被他描寫諷剌得不留一些餘地好像法庭上的辯駁駁尼斯街道上的譏笑要是猶太人是有血氣顧羞恥的似乎都該自盡吧</p>
<p>戲劇協社這一次的排演雖未能逹到盡善盡美的一點可是從聽見到的來判斷已是很明顯的使我們知道應雲衛的辛勞演員們的操練不謂無功在現代愛美劇沉寂的時代已足以給我們一個安慰</p>
<p>那天與我们去的沈衡莊君他對我說我在未進大會堂之前有些懷疑進去了之後才覺得懷疑全消回到家裏更感着回味無窮這全是（威尼斯商人）中猶太人給我們的印象</p>

<p>瑪諦新六十生辰（C）</p>
<p>在一九○六年至一九一三年之間瑪諦斯才在藝術的歷史上取得一個最高的位置而在近代的畫家中發生巨大的影響據批評家Andre　Levinson說莫斯科博物院由Schtchoukine和Morosoff所收集的三四十張瑪諦斯的畫已造成了一個眞正的瑪諦斯博物院（跳舞與音樂）或是（紅色的房間）固然重要就是那嬌艶的東方織物Levantine素描亦當特别看重後者是一九二九年的作品現在裝飾着CamilleManclir的牆壁）這些作品已有很精美的複製品在巴黎流行安特萊君這幾句說話是不错的他的線條有獨特的天分所以他的素描純然是創造的結構而表示他最完全的卓越</p>
<p>瑪諦斯在那四十年中過那美備而無恐的生活不可一世的而爲其同時代的人所尊重嘆服的事實究竟何在呢却是他把那裝飾畫的原理應用到油畫上去他走出了比山汀Byzantine的聖像畫和波斯的細巧的畫風之外而以裝飾和韻律將一切的事物繪於同一畫幅的平面也如高更Paul　Gauguin一樣像是受了南洋風物的剌激從壁畫上感到非常的興味的他要總合的用色彩的調和來作純粹的繪畫不期就偏向裝飾的一面如此次會中所陳列的（奥逹利的（奥逹利司克）Cdalisgue倚臥着的奥逹利司克（爲土耳其摩洛哥等蘇丹之女奴）前面安置着的靜物極單純的背景共同組成了一個平面的線的構圖以色彩底裝飾的效果分劃平行的四邊形主要的（奥逹利司克）臥於青色和錄色的背景前恰如看了質地艶麗而色彩鮮明的歐州東方地氈似的那樣狂熱摇動的畫面却是安靜單純的精神依然充滿着就是另一張（人物）Figure也是同一的道理緑色的墻壁和火樣紅的地氈襯托着裸體的人物用兩種强烈而堅固的調子互相創造而結構起來只有數條斜線以指點深度竟可以說是Frise那樣不一點也不瑪諦斯不是一個平凡的工藝者雖然他時常在表現工藝品一流的味道他是將物體還之爲色彩就是上面所說的幾幅畫也是已經爲他集中了平衡了藴蓄在（單純）之内他以不撓的精神爲近代藝術尋求出一條出路</p>

<h3>印度女詩人奈都夫人</h3>
<p>民族運動的健者</p>
<p>繼甘地領導印度無抵抗運動之女詩人奈都夫人（Mrs,Sarojin　Naidn）亦以被捕聞了奈都雖爲印度的政治運動者但她的詩人的名聲實在於世界有地位的今特介紹如左</p>
<p>奈都夫人於十三歲時已寫千三百語之長詩此雖模倣温爾塔司各脫的傑作（湖上的美人）但她於六日間一氣寫此長篇早已發揮了可驚的天才此年更用波斯語寫成叫做（曼爾莫尼呵）的劇這個現在尙出演於印度的戲劇界而博得好評的夫人的詩集在歐洲有各國語言的翻譯被稱爲超過二百種之印度方言亦各有譯本其中由萊門和提拉等巨匠作曲的也不在少數</p>
<p>女士於十二歲及格了馬特拉斯大學的入學考試十六歲單身渡英通學於倫敦的專門學校留學數年後受了西歐的近代思想的洗禮於是回國後其自身雖屬勃拉敏貴族但和平民之男性結婚親戚們也都嚇了一跳的歸印度後之女士的生活就成爲印度方民族復興運動熱烈的鬥士於一九二五年被選爲全印國民會議的議長女性而得此名譽的地位實以女士爲嚆矢去年曾至歐美各地講演歸途本擬兼至中國日本後因國内政局的漸趨緊漲所以就急緊回國</p>
<p>女士於一八七九年二月十三日誕生誕生地點爲特谷安州的哈特拉白脫地方現年爲五十一歲女士的著作則有（破了的翼）和其他詩集三卷以及最近在印度所有關於社會文化及敎育方面進步之講演和印度女子運動的小册子等女士於一九一四年被選爲英國文學協會的會員一九二○年又被舉爲法國文藝恊會會員</p>
<p>女士是被捕了爲祖國而被捕了但在此黑暗的監獄裏也許能夠再產生一部更偉大的作品也未可知的如此則女士此次入獄當更有意議了（悟）</p>
<h3>現代丹麥文學（續）湯增歇陳燮檉筆記</h3>
<p>趙景深在復旦大學講</p>
<p>史克約特堡（Johan　Skgoldloy　I86</p>
<p>Il）他是園丁的兒子一八六一作了兩部書園丁和（一個戰士）寫困難的人的奮鬭因爲他自己是從窮苦中的出身的所以同情於窮苦的人他對於父親不大信仰父子之間意見不能融合他的作品多是關於社會問題的一九○二年作有（格蘭杜姆）（Gyldhobn）寫工人物質上和精神上的痛苦一九一七年作（新人）反對過去的制度同情現代的潮流（Jon　Jahob）（一九二○）和（Logdrn的牧師）（一九二一丨一九二二）是寫父子爭鬥的作品最近我在（斯干底那維亞評論）的丹麥號上看到（史克約特堡）的一篇（Ｊn　Life　and　Death)寫兩個孩子在鄕中游戲釣魚游泳如飛一般長大時都做了軍人兩個孩子的情感很好後來大起來了一個人娶了妻那個天天替他帮忙替他燒飯作衣三人的生活十分安定有一天有妻的這個男子一出去了竟不回來這人很是欵惑於是連忙備了許多船在很冷的冬天他毅然出去找尋他了找了許多時候都找不到心裏十分生氣天將明時到了一個地方無意中忽然看見前面一個人頭原來這人頭便是他那失踪的朋友他欣喜極了極力划船過去這位失踪的朋友因爲所坐的船已被冰挫破漸漸破裂沉下來是這樣跌入河裏去的河中因爲冰凍很厚只沉了半身頭仍舊露在水面上到了第二天早上才被那位没有妻子的救起這一段極有趣味文中關於風景的描寫也很好我們看過蘇德曼的（情海波瀾）（Swn　Rie)電影的其中也有這樣的描寫史克約特堡所寫大半是Lumgjord的農夫兼寫大自然的風景他的文字不加修飾極其自然作品中含有了解同情信仰人生等等情感</p>
<p>阿克約（Jeppe　Akyxr　I866丨）是丹麥一個抒情的詩人在抒情詩中表現農民的生活含有特異的神態他同時也能作小說但他的小說都被詩的盛名籠蓋了所以人多善談他的詩不大注意他的小說前三年是他六十歲的紀念曾把過去的事踪追述出來作一本書叫做（我的幼年）阿克約是一個農夫的兒子自己還過着農夫的生活他的家庭是很貧苦所以讀書的時候年紀已很遲了他到了二十八歲才進大學大學畢業後做了幾年敎師也曾做過新聞記者積了許多錢後來又抛棄了講師新聞記者的事業跑到Solling半島上購置田地又重温他少年時代的耕作生涯他對於農對感到非常的興趣但一面仍舊研究文學在這一個時期中顯然有了很大的進步阿克約也是約特蘭（Ｊutlnd)人約特蘭是丹麥的大陸少受外來影響的侵略還能有些保存北歐的特質在（約特蘭派）中阿克約自是其中的一個重要的人物他曾編約特蘭作家的年報又編過（約特蘭文選）阿克約描寫本地風光在他的抒情中感到一種幽趣他在社會上的觀察點是急進而又保守的小說則作有（農人之子）（一八九九）戴怒之子）（一九○四）（寄宿學校）（一九○七）等書詩以（小麥歌）（一九○六）和（Hemdal的跋涉（一九二四）最爲著名阿克約所居的地方多是鄕人他不要人家的供給只求自己供給自己他們那鄕村的屋子不大好窗子也常不開一年只換一次床但是屋子外面倒有絕好的風景於是這詩人便在大自然的懷抱裏望望滿佈榖粒的廣山琤琮的河水高的天空翱的飛鳥棕色的地這些都賜給他以無限的詩境他在假日的時候便和農夫一塊兒嘲笑玩賞春耕夏耘秋收到了豐熟更表現出一種嬌喜他的歌曲和詩有動人的音律大半是回憶兒時的追寫</p>

<p>第四十一章哥德以後的德意志文學</p>
<p>海湼的作品在其本身恐怕較之他的人格及影響價值要小罷在今日像亞諾爾特那樣將他作爲哥德的天才之抒情詩底繼承者而論述起來於他是莫名其妙的事罷海湼的數百首初期的詩是無生氣而幾乎趣味惡俗的幸而他的詩底作品的全體則　　大在那里遺留着最優的（北海）系的傳說那剥脫了初期的作品的薔薇和歡喜内容上眞實的後期的詩中最熱誠眞摯的東西他的散文未得相當的名聲這是豐富輕快雄辯機警而有色彩的他如他自己所說似的是在求解放的人類的戰爭中的戰士而他的散文在無數的雄辯熱烈的頁子保留着那戰爭的記錄</p>
<p>當十九世紀中葉海湼的名聲最高時兩個偉大的人物没没無聞地工作着這就是理查瓦格湼和夫里陀里希赫伯爾瓦格湼縱有他的臺本的詩和理論底的論文嚴密地說起來却不是屬於文學的人算是偉大的作家而更偉大的思想家名人的夫里陀里希赫伯爾則不然經了困難的無收成的寂寞的諸年赫伯爾想出近代劇丨那首先現於他的作品繼而現於伊勃生以及繼續出世的一切人們的作品的劇來他將劇底鬭爭從具現嚴肅的道德概念的人們移到那些概念本身去他將世界和文明史帶到劇底詩人的審判廷去他着想到當或一（傳統）死去另一發生的時代人和他的道德爲生而死的時代最初可發生的劇他的主要的作品（瑪利亞·馬革逹雷那）（海羅台斯和瑪里安尼（迦伊該斯和他的指環）（阿格湼柏瑙尼）等都是由劇底動作和推論之緊張的雄辯的接近說明着那個理論的赫伯爾死了多年之後出現了他的日紀那强大而誠實的精神的記錄較之他的戲曲或許更重的作品</p>
<p>兩個傑出的小說家屬於這時代即瑞士作家中最著名者推阿陀爾豐坦和斯脫拉斯堡刻勒豐垣是寫實主義底甚至自然主義底小說的先驅者他產出（藹飛勃利愛斯脫）及（生的混亂）似的小小的然而確實的傑作來刻勒是有着國際底重要的人物他那算是他自身的内底發逹的故事的長篇小說（格林亨利）並不是通體最易讀的東西他的短篇小說則是傑作刻勒有着看見生之奇妙的諧謔底的樣相的眼睛是見到瑞士的農夫和市人的弱點的他是散文的巨匠而出自他本國的過去及現在的他的故事屬於十九世紀的小說中最健全最愉快的一類</p>
<p>在德意志同在法蘭西一樣從一八五○年至一八七○年之間見到詩的純然的形式的開發慕尼克派在許多深有興味的幾點和高蹈派平行着這一派的頭目便是寫作那些長久著名而在今日則似乎褪色而孱弱了的小說和故事而他的名聲非落在極純粹而澄明的詩的選集上不可的保羅海最還有寫作傳統底德意志風的美的羅曼底抒情詩而仗了嚴肅光澤爽朗的聨句數年之間算是國民詩人的厄曼紐厄爾該伯爾然而話雖如此寫着德意志語的這一種的最優的詩人却是另一個瑞士人康拉特斐迪南邁爾在他内中（唯美派詩人）的澄明和温和的雄辯是同高的理想力和有蠱惑力的音樂相結合的</p>

<h3>海陸豐的婦女生活彭成慧</h3>
<p>海陸豐是廣東東江東南部惠州和潮州交界地方的兩個相連的縣城從前這二個縣城本是合共一個的名叫陸安縣後來因感於地方過闊管理上有許多困難纔分成海豐與陸豐二縣所住人民大約可分爲二部分一部分是講客話的一部分便是講福老話（即潮州話）的不過講福老話的人數比較多一點并且多住附城及城之東南一帶而客屬的（即講客話的）則多住城之西北一帶爲了附城及東南一帶較多爲平陽少山并且言語不同的關係所以這二部分人的風俗習慣便因之異樣而婦女的生活亦就因之不同了現在我就先說客屬的婦女生活然後再說講福老話的婦女生活</p>
<p>記得潘光旦先翻譯的自然淘汰與中華民族性那篇文章内面有說中國的客屬人是發逹最早的從他們婦女不纏足方面便可以作一個明顯的例證這話的確不錯中國無論任何地方的客屬婦女都是不纏足的所以在海陸豐的客屬婦女都是天足的她們以天足爲美麗爲爽快以包足爲可笑爲碍事爲了是天足所以她們可以帮助男子作事她們在家裏時喜歡織布有許多竟可以將自己所織的布足用而不再買外來的她們除了燒飯織布和其他的家庭瑣事外只要她們有時間便帮助男子在外工作因此在海陸豐凡是客屬地界的田野或者是山林隨時隨地都可以看見一般婦女們底努力工作尤其是一般年青的女郎當上山採薪或牧牛的時候便非常高興地放開她們嘹的歌喉唱着一種音調和諧動聽的山歌來如果當時逢着有男子她們便曾你一隻我一隻的對唱起來渠們這種山歌并不是怎樣努力學來的而是一種臨時的一種自然的表現所以渠們對唱的山歌没有一隻是呆板的而是隨聲應對的生動的并且愈唱愈多層出不窮在嶺東方面所以能够產生這樣多有價值的山歌便是這個緣故渠們所唱的山歌自然是關於愛情的多并且竟有許多竟因此對唱而致於戀愛的這纔是一件人欽慕的事情呢</p>
<p>她們因爲多住鄕下并且又因要帮助工作所以她們對於裝飾方面便没有機會塗粉而且她們亦不喜歡塗粉她們以塗粉爲麵面爲可笑但們雖然不塗粉却另有一種自然樸素的美麗并且又因所住的地方多山明水秀所以她們的性情便多優美伶俐又因她們多動作所以身體便特别的壯健因此在海陸豐客屬任何地方常常可以看到面容粉紅俏麗身體矯健性情活潑的年青女郎這并不是有意張大其詞事實上確是如此的她們對於梳妝方面喜歡梳那種方便的美觀的圓頭（她們俗呌省城頭省城即廣州俗稱）而不喜歡梳那種講福老話人慣梳的不方便的難看的大狗尾（俗稱這種頭頗難梳形如大斧頭甚難看并且梳起這種頭不敢跑快因爲一跑快形狀便不能正正如斧頭般而要墜下來了）如果每逢着有梳這種頭的人從她們下鄕經過時她們便要齊集出來笑着好像看什麽希奇的事一樣由此可見她們不獨對於工作方面有一種超越的態度而對於審美觀念亦就有相當的愛好了</p>
<p>至若講到講福老話的婦女生活那就不同了那就完全與客屬的相反了她們完全喜歡纒足的包得愈小便愈好（三寸金蓮七寸腰）差不是深印在她們腦中而永不會忘記的金科玉律做父母的尤其是嘉歡渠們的女兒的足能夠纒得小因爲纒得愈小便可以希望嫁得有錢有勢的好丈夫因此她們對於纒足不論怎樣難受不論怎樣痛苦她們都願意忍受下去間有許多因感於痛苦不過無勇氣纒得小得她們的母親便要打她駡她說她不中用壓迫她流着涙盡量纒下去這實是一件慘無人道最痛心的事她們已然是纒足所以她們便不能夠帮助男子工作因此她們只好終日躱在家裏較爲有錢的便終日閒着玩着較爲貧窮的便做一種破香枝的工作（講福老人特别迷信神宫廟宇特别多所以做破香枝的生意常年都有可做）她們喜歡拜神</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>所以無論何時只要你一踏進神宫殿宇裏面去你便可以看見許多婦女門虔誠地在那裏求神拜佛摇籤問卦口中不住地囉囉囌囌念着佛佛爺爺比佑無彊六畜平安等肉麻話她們對於妝飾方面喜歡塗脂抹粉并且塗得很厚所以在海陸豐講福老話的任何地方你隨時都可以看到一般婦女的面容如石膏像般的那樣白而難看她們對於梳妝喜歡梳上面說過的那種大狗尾并且梳得愈大愈薄她們便覺得愈好看并且很小心地保護着不准任何人的手觸着因爲一觸到形狀便要改變了她們的時間因爲在家多閒着没事所以她們喜吃她們除開正午和晚上二餐飯早晨一餐粥外還要吃幾餐茶（參以菜與米乾）因此她們有的差不多每天竟吃到六七餐她們吃茶的力量很好隨便可以吃四五碗吃的時候不用箸而是以手當箸這的確是一件可笑的事情又因爲她們纒足少動終日如坐牢般的禁在家裏所以她們的性情亦就没有客屬的那樣活潑矯健了</p>

<h3>德士古西區服務站訪問記志</h3>
<p>寂寞的霞飛路西段現在因爲都市人口重心的遷移已逐漸的發逹起來所有的空地也慢慢地蓋上了渠渠夏屋可是獨有一塊地方爲了位置和大小的關係一年前還是荒蕪着直到如今纔得到一個極好的利用利用它的便是德士古汽油公司這塊地方是在霞飛路姚主敎路福開森路之處地位當然再好也没有了可是可惜地方太小而且是一個三角形住宅和大建築都不敷用末了德士古公司却看中了</p>
<p>德士古公司把這三角形的空地整個的改造起來用水泥築了一條横貫的大道一端接着霞飛路一端接着姚主敎路在大道的西面築了一所辦事室一共有兩間大道的中間分列着六七個加油站兩個最大的是加汽油的其餘是加滑油的還有一架上面寫着汽與水大道前面的空地用碧草舖着並且用花嵌成TAXICO六字路道的人都爲這緑草紅花誘引着夜裏呢燦爛的燈光從緑蔭的耀着分外覺得情景的嫵媚</p>
<p>一個暮春的傍晚我信步的閒鍍着可以經道了這德士古的新服務站於是不遲疑地進去訪問了一位中年的服務員狠和譪的出來接待着我把來意說明了於是問</p>
<p>（這服務站的工作包括幾種可以議我知道嗎）</p>
<p>（可以的先生我們工作包括加油修車打氣添水洗車等種）</p>
<p>（服務員就是你一人嗎）這也許是因爲我常看見他一人在裏面的緣故</p>
<p>（不每天由兩個人輪值的）</p>
<p>（每天加油的車輛大概有多少）</p>
<p>（没有定的平均起來一天約摸銷售一百多中侖）</p>
<p>我們心裏似乎驚異了因爲我很少碰着他在做生意的其實呢也許營業時間不在晚上罷了</p>
<p>（那麽酬勞是怎樣的呢）</p>
<p>（我們固定的薪金有限得狠不過每賣一個加侖我們可將一分錢的拆頭生意愈多所得也愈大每天賣出一百加侖就可以得一元）</p>
<p>這時候我們看見裏面一個馬逹機不禁又問</p>
<p>（這機器是做什麽用的）</p>
<p>（是打氣的電氣來工作成績狠好）</p>
<p>自然囉汽車走到這種距離市面很遠的地方打氣也是一件極難解决的問題這種設備又那能少得呢門外又有一所狹長形的乾池據他說這池是用來洗車和加油修車的汽車停在池上服務者站在下面工作旣穩妥又便利修理汽車的是一位外國工程師祗有日間是在這裏的六時以後便走了</p>
<p>（外面的加油站）是怎樣分列的　）我看到許多紅柱而引起興趣</p>
<p>（兩個大站是加汽油的一站比較好些每加侖是八角五分還有一站是八角二分半此外加機油的共分四種一是最重油（Extra　beavy）一是重油(Heavy)一是中號油(Median)一是輕油(Lighr)德士古的機油尤其著名於全球每加侖四元多價錢雖貴些但很爲一般人所樂用還有一架寫汽與水的是表示打汽胎和加水的打氣和加水一律不收費以資宣傳汽油是由總公司運來的一次可運一千多加侖）他這樣滔滔不絕的告訴我</p>
<p>（交易是現金還是記賬呢）我又想到這一層因爲也許乘車的人没有帶錢在身邊又當怎樣呢</p>
<p>（不一定現金固然可以如果主顧没有備錢時可以照單塡寫一張寫明車號地址由總行派人按址去取好了）</p>
<p>除了告訴我以上的情形以外他還告訴我關於購這塊地方的有趣味掌故他說（這塊地方原是租的價值是五千兩租十年可是現在却買了然而這是外人萬科想不到的便是這小小三角形地上除了公司所購的外還有一些是租來的就是大道外面六尺以外的地段仍非公司所有管有送小小地皮的是一個鄕下人公司再三去接洽他終是不肯賣價錢也出了狠高可是他無論怎樣不售於是祇得向他租了）我聽了不禁也好笑起來</p>
<p>四圍的暮色漸漸的蒼茫我所希望知道的都知道了我辭了服務員將走他還給我一本（汽車潤滑說明書）其中除登載關於加各種車子的滑油方法外並且有一張德士古在好施登總公司的攝影眞富麗偉大極了</p>
<p>我終於别了他一路追想着覺得德士古公司能選到這所極佳的地位來做他的西區服務站將來的發展眞可說是無有際挨因此一方面我們佩服公司服光的遠大一方面預祝公司前途無限的光明（國恥日於交通大學）</p>

They have been engaged in extremely fierce battles with our army for several days. However, the enemy's firepower is insufficient, relying solely on night attacks, resulting in many deaths by our forces. A general offensive by our army can resolve the situation (Special dispatch on the 26th).</p>

In recent days, they have engaged in extremely fierce battles with our army. However, the rebel army lacks explosives and ammunition and relies solely on night attacks. These attacks were all suppressed by our machine guns and artillery fire, resulting in numerous casualties in several close-quarters combat engagements. The enemy's morale is not broken, and a fundamental solution can be achieved within days. (3) After being ambushed and disarmed by our army, Yang Xiaoou led his remnants through Yanggeji and retreated towards Kaifeng.

<h3>Deployment in Southern Hunan Complete</h3>

<p>Changsha, He Jian Telegram on the same day: The Central Government stated that the people of Hunan have long suffered from bandit and communist devastation, and their vitality is exhausted. They urgently need rest and should seek to develop construction. However, since the bandits and communists such as Peng, Huang, and He Long have disturbed the border areas, the Road Army has requested and been approved to draw back the troops suppressing the rebellion to the province to encircle and suppress them. Unexpectedly, the rebel generals Tang Zheming, Tang Shengming, and others colluded with the remnants of Gui and Zhang's forces to take the opportunity to invade Southern Hunan, remotely supporting the bandits and communists. The remaining people are about to fall into a dire situation. Obeying the Central government's order to defend the local area, I vow to simply gather the troops and launch a head-on attack. I have ordered the front-line troops to advance in multiple directions, striving to eliminate the rebel atmosphere and clear out the bandits and communists in the shortest possible time, so that the dying people of Hunan can find peace. I respectfully telegraph this report for your review. He Jian (Special dispatch on the 27th).</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>French Media's Indignation at Italian Prime Minister's Speech</h3>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has repeatedly made aggressive remarks, which this reporter has discussed before. Recently, his party members, under Mussolini's hypnotic influence, have loudly chanted slogans to "Overthrow France." French public opinion has unanimously expressed indignation, claiming that they cannot tolerate such violent intimidation, leading them to consider halting Franco-Italian negotiations to deal with the situation. Franco-Italian relations have become increasingly strained. I have previously discussed why Mussolini dares to repeatedly make such provocative statements, wondering what he relies on. His army has not demonstrated any victorious achievements, and his economy lacks the capacity for war. What exactly is he boasting about? In a speech to 300,000 people in Milan, Mussolini boasted that Italy's economic position was not inferior to other countries. However, according to those who understand Italy's economic situation, Italy's domestic economy has been increasingly panicked since the Fascist dictatorship, with the number of bankruptcies increasing daily. The people's economy has been severely oppressed, with reduced income, low wages, and significant difficulties in production. The government's financial revenues and expenditures cannot offset each other, and false comparison tables are often found in the budget. Military expenditures have more than doubled compared to before the Fascist dictatorship. In addition to the army, navy, and air force, there is also the so-called "National Militia," which is solely responsible for protecting the Fascists, resulting in astonishing expenses. All armed Fascist Party members can arbitrarily demand expenses from local governments. The Fascists' expenses are not limited to the military and police; they also spend heavily on propaganda and all kinds of projects. Although the Fascists initially announced tax cuts as a policy platform when they came to power, they still cannot avoid increasing taxes and levies to compensate under such circumstances. Therefore, speaking only of the economy, the Fascists' achievements do not seem to warrant boasting. If, unfortunately, they were to resort to arms, could they adequately cover military expenditures? The reason why countries are advocating peace is precisely because the economies of all countries are facing difficulties. The reason why the world hopes for the success of the London Conference is that they fear that the economies of all countries cannot withstand being plunged into war again. Yet Mussolini repeatedly expresses his dissatisfaction with this international gathering, and it is truly unclear what his intentions are.</p>

<h3>Sino-Russian Conference Still Awaits Official Meeting</h3>
<p>Scope of Agenda Not Yet Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Expert Committee Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Russian Consul in Harbin Summoned Back Home</p>
<p>Harbin, Russian Consul in Harbin, Melnikov, returned to Russia on the 25th. The Sino-Russian Conference has been temporarily suspended due to differences in opinions on the scope of the agenda. Russia has summoned the Harbin Consul back for consultation. The official meeting's opening is pending (Special dispatch on the 26th). Harbin, Russia has opened a Sino-Russian Conference venue within the Foreign Affairs Committee (Special dispatch on the 26th).</p>
<p>Harbin Railway Bureau received a telegram from Moscow stating that the Sino-Russian Conference will be held in two stages: preparatory and official. The preparatory meeting has just been held, and the official meeting can be held around June 15th (Special dispatch on the 26th).</p>
<p>Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports that the Russian expert committee members for the Sino-Russian Conference have been appointed as follows: Katsyrovsky, Director of the Eastern Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Dr. Sabanin, Director of the Treaty Department; Piergament, Director of the National Bank; Berlatsky, Director of the Board of Directors; Govman, Head of the Treaty Section of the Ministry of Commerce; Izmailov, Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway; and Kantorovich, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Special dispatch on the 27th).</p>
<p>Harbin, On the 20th, a meeting was held in Moscow. The Sino-Russian Conference is scheduled to officially convene on June 1st. Mo Dehui, the Chinese plenipotentiary, is currently unofficially exchanging views with the Soviet Russian representatives, and progress is smooth. Once formal negotiations begin, a special committee will be established to discuss the proceedings. The Chinese side intends to fundamentally resolve the issue of purchasing the Eastern Railway at this conference. Regarding this matter, a certain important figure in Soviet Russia expressed the following opinion: If the Chinese side purchases the Chinese Eastern Railway legally and reasonably based on the Sino-Russian and Feng-Russian agreements at a reasonable price, the Soviet Union, considering the current domestic situation and international relations, believes that abandoning the railway is a better strategy from a broader perspective. The average annual income of the Eastern Railway is approximately 10 million yuan. According to the 1924 Feng-Russian Agreement, this income is to be divided equally between China and Russia. Therefore, Soviet Russia's annual income is 5 million yuan. However, judging from the recent operating status of the Eastern Railway, it is difficult to increase revenue in the next ten years. If Soviet Russia maintains the status quo and continues to operate jointly with China for another ten years, it will only gain a profit of 5 million yuan per year, totaling only 50 million yuan in ten years. The profit price of the Eastern Railway will be determined by the Railway Property Valuation Committee organized by the Sino-Russian Expert Committee. Assuming the railway property is worth 200 million yuan, the annual interest rate is 6%, and the interest for ten years is 120 million yuan, which is more than the railway's income over ten years. However, this is based solely on an economic perspective. From the perspective of policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia, the Eastern Railway has a very important mission. It is doubtful whether Soviet Russia will lightly give up and agree to China's purchase, it is said (Telegram from the 26th).</p>
<p>Harbin, The newly appointed Russian Consul in Dalian passed through Harbin on the 25th to take office (Special dispatch on the 26th).</p>
<h3>Mongolian Conference Holds Sixth Preparatory Meeting, Hosts Media Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Mongolian Conference in Nanjing held its sixth preparatory meeting on the 27th to discuss (1) the proposal to organize an Inner Mongolia Administrative Committee; (2) the proposal by Chen Xiaoliang, a representative of the Nansotu League; (3) the proposal by Fu Changling, a representative of the Zhaowuda League; (4) the proposal by Bai Guizhang and others, representatives of the Zhuo and Zhao Leagues; and (5) the proposal to request the formulation of separate measures for the selection of Mongolian personnel. All proposals were divided into groups for review and discussion. After the discussion, the conference elected three members to the presidium of the general assembly: Wu Heling, Li Fang, and Yuan Qingen were elected (Special dispatch on the 27th).</p>
<p>The incoming representatives from Hulunbuir and Liaoning in Nanjing have also attended the preparatory meeting (Special dispatch on the 27th). The Mongolian Conference in Nanjing hosted the media at the Anle Hotel at noon on the 27th. Over fifty people attended. Chairman Ma Fuxiang reported that this conference is related to national unity, ethnic solidarity, and important policies on diplomacy and national defense. The league and banner officials and people's representatives enthusiastically participated. Although the representatives from Western Mongolia could not freely travel south after arriving in Beiping due to the current situation, and it is difficult to determine whether the Qinghai representatives who arrived in Suiyuan will not be obstructed, the tendency of all Mongolian representatives to support the central government, their desire for unity, and their reliance on this conference to resolve all political issues are completely consistent. The representatives from Eastern Mongolia and Hulun have safely arrived in Beijing with the help of Chief Zhang from Northeast China. The conference will no longer be delayed, and the political and cultural progress in the Northeast is excellent. The Northwest people tend to look to the Northeast as a transition. The Northeast representatives who have arrived in Beijing account for the majority.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>All proposals have been fully prepared, and the results will definitely be satisfactory in the future. Next, Wu Heling, Director of the Mongolian Affairs Office, reported the representatives' joy at receiving guidance from the central government in Beijing and the harmony of previous preparatory opinions. The mission of the General Assembly is to accept the leadership of the Kuomintang, obey the Three Principles of the People, and support revolutionary unification; secondly, to establish a sound system, enjoy political benefits, eliminate external oppression, and develop the national spirit; thirdly, to promote cooperation between the central government and local league banners, between officials and the people (Special dispatch on the 27th).</p>

(4) If a telegram received by either a telegraph office or a radio station cannot be sent due to any reason and is sent by the local radio station or telegraph office, the fees should be handled according to the method for receiving (Special dispatch on the 27th).</p>

<p>Nineteen Seriously Wounded, Four Dead</p>

<p>Bombay Cotton Merchants Stop Trading with Europeans</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 26th: Tonight, police clashed with Muslims in the Bendi Bazaar area of Bombay's Muslim district. Police were forced to open fire, seriously wounding twenty-one people, two of whom have died. The incident began with the throwing of stones at a dog. A Muslim threw a stone at the dog of a certain European police officer. The European police officer pursued the person, causing other Muslims to become angry and throw stones at the police and the police station. In self-defense, the police opened fire, wounding many people. The unrest has not yet subsided, and British troops are rushing to the scene.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 27th: Seven rioters were injured during renewed unrest in the Bendi Bazaar. Traffic was blocked for two hours, but the situation largely calmed down by the afternoon. Muslim leaders first requested the police chief to withdraw the street patrol.  Subsequently, teams arrived to appease the crowd in the market. This morning's riot started when Muslims threw stones at soldiers and police, and the police fired three times. A European police officer was hit in the arm by a stray bullet and has been hospitalized.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 27th: Everything is calm in the Bendi Bazaar this morning, but most shops remain closed. More than 5,000 Muslims participated in yesterday's riots. Two of the injured have died in the hospital.</p>
<p>Reuters, Darassana, 26th: The non-violent resistance volunteer camp was attacked by soldiers and police last Thursday. The volunteers were driven out, and their camp was destroyed and occupied. However, the volunteers soon regrouped there. Today, the police again drove them away and destroyed their huts. The government has also announced that the land is not being used for agriculture and should be confiscated.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 26th: Local brokers have made an informal decision not to engage in forward cotton trading with European merchants.</p>
<p>Reuters, Dhaka, 26th: Thirty people were injured in Indian-Muslim clashes that started on Saturday from a trivial matter, six of whom have now died.

The Indian Governor's secretary replied in writing, stating that the police did not take any unnecessary forceful actions under extremely difficult circumstances and showed deep restraint.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th: Indian Affairs Secretary Benn stated in the Lower House today that most people in India are living their lives as usual, peacefully enjoying the benefits of a stable government. Trade is an important indicator of a country's situation. In the past five years, India's private trade has had an annual surplus of 58 million pounds. Indian bonds are now higher than in January. The direction for overcoming difficulties must come from Indian public opinion. No government can ignore public opinion with practical ideas. India is not a market developed for the benefit of the British. Any policy that disregards the interests of all of India is doomed to failure. Harsh tactics and iron fists cannot force Indian farmers to buy British goods. Good intentions and good understanding are the keys to the market. If the disturbances of the past few weeks can awaken the people on both sides to a true understanding of the situation and needs, it may not be a bad thing.</p>
<h3>Burmese Port Workers Riot</h3>
<p>Ethnic Groups Clash</p>
<p>Twenty-Eight Dead, Hundreds Wounded</p>
<p>Chinese Coolies Also Affected</p>
<p>Rangoon Ship Cargoes Unable to be Loaded</p>
<p>Bombay Boycott of Foreign Cloth Expands</p>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 26th: Major conflict has broken out between Burmese ethnic groups, resulting in ten deaths and two hundred and fifty injuries. The unrest has been brewing for a week due to the Burmese port workers' strike, and the fact that Chinese coolies are loading and unloading ships has angered the Burmese workers. Today, they paraded through the streets with weapons, led by sword-wielding monks, attacking any foreign coolies they saw. European police officers were slightly injured, and markets and shops were closed. Burmese newspapers were also attacked. Shipping has been halted. A new cable estimates that a total of twenty-eight people have died in the unrest. According to hospital reports, 276 injured people have been admitted, and 300 others have been treated elsewhere. Most of the injured are natives of Southeast India. The situation is gradually stabilizing. Some of the injured are British Indians. The newspaper offices were destroyed by foreign coolies.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 27th: Several serious clashes broke out again this morning, this time between Indians and Burmese. Police opened fire to stop them, injuring several Indians.</p>
<p>Rangoon: The anti-British movement in India is intensifying. The port of Rangoon has joined the support groups. Indian maritime laborers in the city are participating in anti-British demonstrations.

<p>Also, Bombay: The movement to boycott foreign cloth has now expanded throughout the country. Under strict supervision, spot trading in the city is impossible, and it is difficult to ship goods from warehouses. Futures trading in foreign goods is not being conducted. Although some merchants selling foreign goods are not bound by the boycott resolution, they are afraid of social sanctions and dare not take action. The government is advocating maintaining law and order, using forceful suppression tactics, which only serves to inflame public sentiment and incite moderate elements to revolt. Therefore, the boycott movement has a great momentum of expansion and continuation.</p>
<h3>Cracks in Italian-French Relations</h3>
<p>Italian Premier's Speech Intimidating</p>
<p>French Press Criticizes as Raving</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 26th: Franco-Italian relations have become more strained due to Mussolini's speech in Milan. The Observer criticized it as another instance of madness, saying that the audience, hypnotized at the time, responded loudly to the slogan "Down with France!" which was more disturbing than Mussolini's speech itself. Recently, even conservative newspapers have become less sympathetic to Fascism due to Mussolini's various speeches. The Commentary Daily stated that Mussolini's ravings were incompatible with the traditionally amicable relations between the two countries. Pan Dekshi wrote in the Paris Echo, claiming that France should only immediately and indefinitely postpone Franco-Italian negotiations to respond to Mussolini's speech. In this environment, continuing negotiations might only invite Mussolini's contempt. In short, there is no room for negotiation with a government that seeks to intimidate through force to stimulate the negotiation process.</p>
<h3>German-Polish Border Soldier Clash</h3>
<p>Drunkenness Causes Trouble</p>
<p>Conflict Initiated by Poland</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 26th: Two Polish border soldiers, probably drunk, broke into German East Prussia and attempted to attack German soldiers. The German soldiers arrested the Polish soldiers, who then opened fire. The German soldiers returned fire, killing one Polish soldier and seriously wounding one German soldier. Upon hearing the gunshots, Polish border soldiers immediately crossed the border and fired over a hundred shots at the German soldier station. Fortunately, the German soldiers, under orders from their superiors, did not return fire, preventing a conflict. However, the Germans are very indignant about the Polish soldiers' attack on the soldier station, especially about the Polish soldiers' strong accusation that the German soldiers fired first. Newspapers predict that a serious diplomatic protest will be lodged in Warsaw.</p>

<h3>Japanese Supreme Command Issue</h3>
<p>Government Cannot Escape Responsibility</p>
<p>Military Council to Convene Next Week</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 27th: Navy Minister Kato has submitted his resignation. His reason for resigning is reportedly that the Japanese military strength decided by the London Treaty, from the standpoint of military strategy and tactics, presents difficulties in agreeing with national defense. Therefore, he repeatedly urged the government to pay attention, but the government, without the consent of the Naval General Staff, independently made a decision. The recall order is indeed an infringement of the supreme command, causing this major incident. The responsibility lies entirely with the government. However, he feels responsible for not preventing the issuance of the recall order at the time. Regarding this point, he deeply feels his responsibility. When the government issued the recall order, he had the immediate determination to resign. However, at that time, the position of Navy Minister was held by Prime Minister Hamaguchi. He had doubts about whether a civilian official should hold the position of Navy Minister, so he waited until Navy Minister Zaibe returned to the country before submitting his resignation. Kato's intention to resign is firm, and there is no way to dissuade him at present. However, the Military Council will convene next week, and there may still be room for mediation, but it may turn into a major issue that will take the government's life. It is difficult to predict, so all parties are paying close attention to this.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 27th: Mr. Ikeda Naga, regarding the issue of the supreme command, raised a question in the special parliament. Therefore, he again asked Army Minister Udagaki whether he had signed the recall order for the London Conference. The Army Minister replied that he was ill at the time, so he did not participate in the recall order. However, after the recall order was issued, he received a verbal report from Foreign Minister Shidehara. Therefore, Mr. Ikeda again asked the Army Minister to express his attitude on the issue of the supreme command. The Army Minister replied that he is currently ill, so he will not express his opinion for the time being, but he may express his attitude at an appropriate opportunity. The Seiyukai is extremely indignant about this, considering it an unforgivable and illegal act. However, the government side said that Army Minister Udagaki fully understands and laughs off what Mr. Ikeda has said.</p>

<h3>Japanese Cotton Mills Adopt Short-Time Work System</h3>
<p>Reuters, Osaka, 27th: Japanese cotton mills are now adopting a short-time work system to reduce cotton yarn production in order to maintain market prices. Japanese factories have already reduced production by 17 percent. It is expected that production will be reduced by about another 10 percent starting on July 1st. Currently, total cotton yarn production is 227,000 bales per month. Since 1916, yarn prices have been at their lowest level due to various domestic and international factors favoring the shortage side, such as the sharp decline in textile exports. Although yarn stocks are not too high, cloth stocks are rapidly increasing. It is expected that wage cuts or mass layoffs will be actively implemented sooner or later. Therefore, union leaders are now preparing to resist the situation by means of strikes.</p>

<h3>Jin Army's Attempt to Attack Luokou Repelled</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This morning, Jin troops were discovered near Sangzidian Station, north of Luokou Station on the Jinpu Railway. According to sources from the First Army Corps, this enemy force bypassed from the east of Linqing on the railway and the west of Qihe, attempting to attack the Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge. At that time, they happened to encounter our troops near Que Mountain, north of the railway bridge, and were immediately met with a head-on blow. By 7:00 a.m., they had been completely repelled. According to railway sources, this enemy force was discovered after 2:00 a.m. Soldiers were carrying large axes on their backs, attempting to destroy the road. The vanguard was a cavalry regiment. At this time, Han Fuju happened to be returning from Yucheng on the Beiping armored train. Behind the armored train was a railway team car, and behind the railway team was the Shandong armored train. Initially, it was not possible to identify the army in the dark. They did not open fire, and we did not open fire either. Later, Han himself noticed that the army's caps were different and ordered to open fire. The other side immediately returned fire. Han personally got out of the car and led the guards to meet them head-on. The enemy army, knowing that we were prepared, immediately fled. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the enemy troops were killed everywhere. Han Fuju is still on the Beiping armored train, going to the front to command. It is said that a general attack order has been issued, with a deadline of five days to recapture Dezhou. The telegram from the First Army Corps today is recorded as follows: (According to the telegraph from Army Commander Sun Jing, according to the report from Brigade Commander Zhan Shutang, at 9:00 a.m. near Sanjiaqiao, Zhuzhuang, and Weizhuang, enemy cavalry of about a regiment harassed our rear. Our Second Regiment, with the cooperation of armored vehicles, used artillery to bombard fiercely. The enemy force was unable to withstand the pressure and collapsed to the southwest. Dozens of enemy cavalry were discovered in Zhuzhuang, five miles southwest of Wanzhuang. A platoon of infantry was dispatched to meet them, killing more than ten enemy cavalry. The remaining ones fled to Anren Street.) (25th)</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Clarifies Ambiguities in the Trade Union Law</h3>
<p>Due to ambiguities in the Trade Union Law, the Executive Yuan previously consulted the Legislative Yuan for interpretation. The Legislative Yuan referred the matter to the Labor Law Drafting Committee for review. After a meeting on March 26, the committee submitted its resolutions to the Yuan. These resolutions were passed during the 92nd meeting last week. The full text of the original interpretation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The distinction between "industry" and "occupation" mentioned in the first point of the original list should be interpreted in accordance with Article 2 of the Enforcement Rules of the Trade Union Law. Except for the restrictions stipulated in Article 3 of the Trade Union Law, employees of both industries and occupations can be considered included.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the second point, whether a trade union can be established in the same region by the initiation of 50 or more workers in the same occupation or 100 or more workers in the same industry, regardless of the number of members. According to the Trade Union Law, there are restrictions in Article 6. If there are 100 or more industrial workers or 50 or more occupational workers, the Trade Union Law applies to the organization of a trade union.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the third point, concerning the dissolution of a union if the number of members is insufficient. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that the dissolution of a trade union due to insufficient members, as stipulated in Article 36 of the same law, refers to the legal number of members required to establish a trade union as specified in Article 1, and not necessarily to more than half of all workers as the legal number of members to establish a trade union. This interpretation does not deviate from the original intention of the draft and can be followed.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the fourth point, whether former trade union employees can join the trade union as members. According to Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Trade Union Law, only those who have been elected as officials of the trade union are allowed to join the trade union as members. Employees are not included in this provision.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the fifth point, how to distinguish between employed staff and workers in various institutions, and whether trade unions organized by employed staff or those who have joined workers' organizations should be dissolved or ordered to withdraw. The distinction between employed staff and workers has been clearly stipulated in Article 4 of the Enforcement Rules of the Trade Union Law and should be handled accordingly. If employed staff have already organized trade unions or joined workers' organizations, they should be ordered to dissolve or withdraw.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the sixth point, whether the various enterprises listed in Article 3 refer specifically to those run by the state. The various institutions listed in Article 3 of the Trade Union Law do not refer specifically to those run by the state. The original text has clearly stipulated this.</p>
<p>(7) Regarding the seventh point, how to handle the procedures for establishing a trade union. It should be handled in accordance with the Organizational Regulations for People's Organizations.</p>
<p>(8) Regarding the eighth point, how to deal with a trade union engaging in profitable business in the name of a production cooperative. It should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the Enforcement Rules of the Trade Union Law.</p>
<p>(9) Regarding the ninth point, the number of directors and supervisors, and whether individual directors and supervisors can independently represent the trade union externally. The number of directors and supervisors has been stipulated in Article 14 of the Enforcement Rules of the Trade Union Law. The powers of directors and supervisors can be determined according to their respective articles of association. If there are no provisions, the provisions of the Civil Code regarding legal entities apply.</p>
<p>(10) Regarding the tenth point, whether the non-trade union members listed in Article 11 refer to any ordinary person. The non-trade union members who can be elected as mentioned in Article 11 of the Trade Union Law should be interpreted as anyone other than members can be elected, but only with the approval of the competent authority.</p>
<p>(11) Regarding the eleventh point, whether there are qualifications for the proxy of trade union directors. It should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 21 of the Enforcement Rules of the Trade Union Law.</p>
<p>(12) Regarding the twelfth point, according to Article 16, trade unions organized by workers in various enterprises listed in Article 3 do not have the right to conclude collective agreements. However, if employers have already concluded collective agreements before the implementation of this law, how should they be handled? If there are any conflicts with the Trade Union Law before its implementation, the collective agreements already concluded should be deemed invalid. Furthermore, since the various enterprises listed in Article 3 are mainly state-owned, they naturally focus on the interests of workers. The so-called invalidity is limited to the effect of collective agreements, but it does not prevent the effect of general contracts. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Shantou's Anti-Tax Strike</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Shantou Mayor Xu Xiqing recently imposed an additional 20% tax on electricity throughout the city. The Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly convened meetings to appeal to the national and provincial governments to abolish it. However, Xu still ordered all police districts to enforce the collection. On the afternoon of the 21st, Wang Naixun, the chief of the first police district, following orders, sent Zhang Guohua, a household registration officer, to Jiacheng Zhuang on Yonghe Street to collect the additional electricity tax, which led to a dispute. Chief Wang immediately dispatched several armed police officers to tie up Fang Changda, the manager of Jiacheng Zhuang, with hemp rope and take him away. At the district office, Fang was forced to sign a confession admitting to insulting the police and was fined 15 yuan. Fang refused and was detained at the police station. Jiacheng Zhuang immediately filed a complaint with the remittance office, and the silver industry also held a plenary session, resolving to suspend business on the 22nd and requesting the government to dismiss Xu Xiqing and Wang Naixun and thoroughly abolish the additional electricity tax to appease the business community. After the resolution, they went to the General Chamber of Commerce to petition. The General Chamber of Commerce sent Shi Ziqin and Ma Zonghan as representatives to meet with Mayor Xu Xiqing. Xu replied that the additional electricity tax had been included in the city treasury's budget and that there were no other sources of income to offset it, so it would naturally be enforced. Fang Changda, who was detained in the first district, had not been reported to the government and that he would wait for clarification and order the district office to allow bail. The representatives of the Chamber of Commerce ultimately failed to achieve their objective and reported back to the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce then held an emergency meeting, attended by more than a hundred representatives from various businesses throughout the city, and resolved to telegraph the national and provincial governments to thoroughly abolish the additional electricity tax, request the removal of the illegal police officers, and release Fang Changda. However, that evening, Yang Jianping, the Customs Superintendent, acted as a mediator, shuttling back and forth until late at night, but unfortunately, there was still no result. On the 22nd, all stores in the city were completely on strike, and the remittance office and the silver industry suspended all transactions. Xu Xiqing also took a car at 8 o'clock in the morning, accompanied by two armed police officers, to inspect the situation in the city. This case may not be resolved in a short time. (22nd)</p>
<h3>After the Cessation of the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors Orders Resumption</p>
<p>The Authorities Plan to Recover and Operate it Themselves</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Eastern Railway announced the cessation of the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine on May 14th by order of the Bureau, with employee salaries paid up to the 15th. This Bureau order was not agreed to by the Chinese side in advance. Therefore, Li Shaogeng, the acting Chinese Director, questioned the Russian Deputy Director, Ye Musahanov, two days ago, based on the fifth item of the Road Bureau's request to order the Russian Su Cheng and Far East coal mines (one side buys Russian coal to supplement the other side while still proceeding with the restoration of the Zhalan Coal Mine). He demanded that the Road Bureau be ordered to quickly restore the Zha Mine by order of the Board of Directors. Ye agreed to handle it at the time. After this order arrived at the Road Bureau yesterday, the Russian Director ignored it. This is because the import of Russian coal and the abandonment of the Zha Mine were both predetermined plans of the Russian side and contained deep meaning. The cessation of the mine was initially not moved by the Chinese Director's request for the Board of Directors to issue an order. Only when the Russian Director obtained the Board of Directors' approval for the purchase funds for the Su Cheng and Far East coal mines did he pay a batch. It is expected that the Russian coal will be imported in early July. Our authorities regard the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine as the lifeline of fuel for the Eastern Railway. If the Russian side insists on its own way and refuses to restore the mine, then the only way is to impose heavy taxes on the Russian coal when it is imported, so that it has no profit to gain. The original plan will inevitably be shaken. In addition, the Hei Province government will be ordered to take back and continue to operate the Zha Mine without compensation, according to the contract when the Zha Mine was opened. If the Russian side intends to cut off the fuel source of the Eastern Railway by abandoning the mine, and if Hei Province proposes to take over, the Russian side will inevitably persevere and continue to operate it. If so, its conspiracy to destroy the Zha Mine may not be implemented. At present, workers are still mining coal manually at the Zhalan Coal Mine and selling it to Manzhouli Station and other places to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, although the Road Bureau has issued a cessation order, the workers have not yet expressed any opinions. (23rd)</p>
<h3>Great Chaos in the Soviet Union's Coastal Province</h3>
<p>White Russians Launch Insurrection and Clash with the Red Army</p>
<p>Miners Also Demand Improved Treatment</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: According to foreign news here, farmers in Sibask and Yima, near Vladivostok, colluded with White Russians to rebel against the Soviet Russian government's communist policies. A portion of the Red Army sent to suppress the turmoil also took unified action with the White Russian farmers and others. The rebels and farmers declared that they were led by Grand Duke Nicholas, who resides in France, to restore the old Russian Empire. In less than a week since the uprising, farmers in the coastal province have risen up in response, and the chaos has expanded to an uncontrollable state. Last week, the Soviet Russians sent troops to suppress the uprising, resulting in many casualties. The rebels and farmers hid in the mountains as their base and confronted the Red Army. The Far Eastern Government was extremely frightened by this and urgently ordered the elite troops of the National Defense Army in the Boli area to suppress the uprising. The transport of troops on the Ussuri Road has been extremely busy in recent days. The Russian authorities feared that all the farmers in the Jiaer coastal province would join the uprising, and also sent troops to conduct a thorough search. As a result, many farmers and workers have been arrested and imprisoned. It is also heard that in recent days, secret reactionaries in Vladivostok have launched several riots against the Russian Political Bureau. Several members of the National Political Bureau were injured. Young workers, students, and soldiers have joined the reactionary elements. The Russian authorities in Vladivostok have organized a special army under the command of the National Political Bureau to arrest the reactionaries. On May 19th, several clashes occurred between farmers, workers, and civilians and the National Political Bureau's army in the docks and city streets. The unstable situation has now spread to the Sucheng coal mine branch road in the Amur Province, and a section of it has been destroyed. The miners serving in the Sucheng coal mine also put forward serious conditions on the 13th of this month, demanding that the authorities improve their treatment and raise their wages, and they are brewing a strike. The Russian authorities, fearing that the miners would collude with the armed White Russians hiding near the coal mine and cause trouble, have transferred elite troops to protect it. The international communist army of Koreans and Japanese has also been sent to the area. Vladivostok has been placed under martial law. The Soviet Union's Far Eastern Fleet has sailed from Boli to protect the port. (21st)</p>
<h3>Result of Lu Genrong Case's Extraordinary Appeal</h3>
<p>Supreme Court Judgment Remands for Retrial</p>
<p>The widely publicized master-servant love affair case involving Lu Genrong, since the Wu County District Court's trial in 1928, Lu Genrong was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for the crime of enticement. Lu refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyer Song Mingxun to appeal to the High Court. The High Court's former Third Chamber, presided over by Judge Peng Qi, revoked the original judgment and sentenced Lu to four years of imprisonment. Lu refused to accept this verdict and filed a second appeal to the Supreme Court, which was remanded for retrial. On June 27th of last year, the case was still tried by Judge Peng and the conviction for the crime of enticement was revoked and replaced with a conviction for the crime of assisting theft, for which he was sentenced to two years of imprisonment. Lu still refused to accept the verdict and filed an extraordinary appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has now ruled to remand the case for retrial. The judgment has been delivered today (27th). The excerpt is as follows:</p>
<p>(Supreme Court Criminal Judgment (19th Year Shang Zi No. 787)) Appellant: Lu Genrong, male, 24 years old, from Wu County, resident of the Wu Ta Ye Tea House. The above appellant filed an appeal against the second instance retrial judgment of the Jiangsu High Court on June 27th, 1929, in the case of assisting theft. The judgment of this court is as follows: (Main Text) The original judgment regarding the crime and punishment is revoked and remanded to the Jiangsu High Court for retrial. (Reason) Although the appellant has consistently denied the act of assisting theft, the circumstances of how the appellant committed adultery with Huang Zhu's daughter, Huang Huiru, and fled together to Suzhou have been clearly admitted in previous trials and confessed in the Public Security Bureau. He stated, "On the 13th of this month, I brought Miss Huiru out and took valuable ornaments," without denying it. The informant, Huang Zhu, also recounted, "Huang Huiru did not go out on the 12th. Lu Genrong and his cousin came to my house to take clothes and other things. I checked the things on the 12th. I asked Huiru, 'Lu Genrong took them out,' and she said, 'They were first placed in Qu Xingtai's woodworking shop.'" She also said that "he (referring to Huang Huiru) left very early (i.e., the morning of the 13th). Everyone downstairs was asleep and did not see him leave. Because I had not slept all night, I saw him leave. He left empty-handed and did not take anything." In addition, Huang Huiru stated in the first instance that "the things were taken out in the afternoon of the 12th. Lu Genrong came out on this day." The suspicion that the appellant committed a crime is unavoidable. However, the appellant stated during the investigation that "the jewelry was taken out by the young lady herself on the 13th." His statements in the two trials were consistent. Huang Huiru also stated that "the things were all taken by myself when I left on the 13th. I did not tell him (referring to the appellant) to take them." She also said, "He (referring to the appellant) only knew that I was wearing ordinary clothes and did not know there were jewelry." Whether the appellant had any connection with Huang Huiru's theft before the crime was committed still needs to be confirmed with additional evidence. Moreover, since Huang Zhu claimed that Lu Genrong took the things and placed them in Qu Xingtai's woodworking shop first, the appellant stated in the first instance that "three boxes were taken out, two by him (referring to Huang Huiru) and one by me." If the appellant had no connection with Huang Huiru's theft before the crime was committed, but moved the items stolen by Huang Huiru to Qu Xingtai's woodworking shop after the crime was committed, he would not be exempted from criminal liability under the criminal law. However, the original trial did not investigate clearly whether the appellant had actually moved the items on that day, whether Huang Huiru's items were among them, and whether Huang Huiru's items were all stolen and known to the appellant. The judgment on the crime and punishment of assisting theft was too hasty. The reasons for the appeal cannot be said to be unreasonable. Based on the above, according to Article 409, Paragraph 1, and Article 413 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>

<p>Thugs violently assault public servants On the afternoon of the 26th, around 4 o'clock, Zhang Boyin, the director of the physical education and hygiene section of the People's Education Center, saw a chartered car parked in the park and called for the driver to move it. Unexpectedly, a street vendor, Fan A Qiao, spoke rudely for no reason, leading to an argument. A Qiao actually relied on his brute force and viciously assaulted the public servant Zhang, lifting him up and slamming him against the bridge pillar seven or eight times, and dragged him into the water to beat him severely. Fortunately, the public servant Zhang was physically strong and did not suffer any major injuries. It is heard that the thug is exceptionally fierce and has killed two people in Hongkou, Shanghai.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Zhuanghang co-conspirator Ye is arrested In the case of the massacre and looting of the Zhuangjiahang town in Fengxian County by the Communist Party the year before last, the market is now gradually recovering. However, many of the main criminals at the time are still at large. Among them, Lu Axiu from Tangwan was a lookout during the incident. After the incident, he fled to another place. Recently, the Zhuangjiahang Public Security Team learned that he had secretly returned and hidden in the home of a farmer surnamed Xue in the Ninth District of Ye Xie, this county. Ten members of the Zhuanghang Public Security Team, led by Captain Yang, disguised themselves and brought weapons to Ye to arrest him at the right time. The matter was kept very secret to avoid leaking the news. After arriving in Ye, they gathered in groups of three or five in the teahouse to sip tea. The local Public Security Sub-station was spreading rumors about the Shengzi Temple robbery and was very attentive to travelers. When they found the disguised members of the Zhuanghang team, they immediately stepped forward to question them. Fortunately, they presented the symbol to avoid misunderstanding. Then, Captain Yang of the team also came to Ye to meet with Inspector Zong of the Public Security Bureau to discuss the matter. That night, they worked together with the anti-smuggling detachment led by Detachment Leader Zhang, and Inspector Zong each led their respective departments with live ammunition, departed in different directions, surrounded the address, and arrested Lu Axiu in Xue Fulin's home silently. Together with the Xue brothers, they were escorted back. In addition to Lu Axiu, who was immediately escorted back to Fengxian by the police to be brought to justice, the Xue brothers were not involved. After local people provided bail, they were released.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The wage demand turmoil of the Suzhou municipal school faculty and staff is resolved. The total resignation of the Suzhou municipal school faculty and staff to demand back pay has lasted for nearly a month. Now, after the county government convened a meeting of school principal representatives to discuss the matter, the faculty and staff were asked to return to work first. Yesterday, the faculty and staff association held a general meeting and put forward four conditions for returning to work, requesting that all of them be accepted by the school principals' association. Zhang Jianchu and Jiang Xie Lan, representatives of the school principals' association, asked Wu Guanghan, the director of the Education Bureau, for instructions. Wu expressed that regarding funding, he would do his best to raise funds and try to arrange for the funds to be released in advance and on time. Regarding the conditions, he would ask the Provincial Education Department for instructions. After the school principals' association informed the faculty and staff association, the association convened another general meeting and decided to return to work on the 28th. The schools will find ways to make up for the children's homework missed during the three weeks of suspension.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Track switchman tragically crushed to death. Kunshan Railway Station track switchman Lv Xueshan was on his way to the track switch location from the station around 6 a.m. on the 26th when a freight train speeding from Beijing to Kunshan came racing along. Lv mistakenly thought the train was the night express and was walking inside the track switching area. Unexpectedly, the train had already entered the track switching area, and Lv was unable to avoid it in time and was crushed to death by the train. His body was dragged for more than a zhang (Chinese measurement unit, roughly 3.3 meters), and he died instantly. His body was lying on the tracks, and his left hand was crushed by the wheels. The scene was very tragic. The stationmaster immediately ordered the porters to move the body to the side of the road, then notified the family of the deceased to come to Kunshan to handle the funeral arrangements and requested compensation from the railway bureau.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhihe's murder of his concubine case appealed. Zhu Zhihe, a villager from Xiejing Village in Xiajiaqiao Township, was inherently violent. Last year, he shot his second concubine seven times with a handgun, causing her to fall into the river and die. Afterwards, the local Public Security Sub-station arrested Zhu and sent him to the county for legal proceedings. After repeated interrogations by the county government, the perpetrator, relying on his family's wealth, hired people outside with large sums of money, hoping to get away with it. It is now learned that the county government has sentenced the perpetrator to life imprisonment, and the perpetrator, dissatisfied with the sentence, has already filed an appeal.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Adding Jail Cells to the County Prison</p>
<p>The buildings of the Wuxi County Prison and the one or two guardhouses are extremely cramped and have been in disrepair for many years. Recently, civil and criminal lawsuits have become increasingly numerous, and the number of prisoners detained has increased several times compared to before. There are as many as 450 prisoners awaiting trial. Recently, Tang Yiqin, a member of the Committee for Clearing Accumulated Cases, has been reviewing and resolving the cases for days, and the number has been reduced to more than 220. However, it is felt that it is impossible to accommodate the convicted criminals. County Magistrate Sun has consulted with the subordinate bureaus and district chiefs to raise more than 5,000 yuan for the construction of additional jail cells. It has been decided to add nine spacious jail cells and bathrooms next to the county prison, and contractors have been hired to complete the construction within two months.</p>
<p>Collection of Construction Special Tax with Slaughter Tax</p>
<p>The case of collecting a construction special tax together with the slaughter tax was previously approved by the Construction Department to temporarily collect half the amount from December of last year to the end of February of this year, for a period of three months. Subsequently, the meat merchants, citing poor harvests and the impact on business, found it difficult to bear the original tax amount and requested the Construction Department to exempt this construction special tax. However, the provincial department, considering it would hinder the general plan, strictly ordered the full tax to be recovered. Official dispatches were exchanged and the matter remained unresolved. Recently, the Construction Department finally ordered that half of the tax be collected and extended for another three months until the end of May. After that, no further excuses or delays would be allowed. However, the deadline of May has passed, and it is imminent that the full amount will be collected. Yesterday, the Construction Department ordered the county to notify the Slaughter Tax Collection Office to collect the full amount.</p>
<p>Gamblers Resisting Arrest and Assaulting Police</p>
<p>Wu A'hu, who runs a teahouse in Shuangbanqiao, Ninth District (Beishang Township) of the county, took advantage of the current high price of cocoons to open a gambling den in his shop. The other day, Wang Tingshu, the chief of the 11th Public Security Sub-bureau, led police officers to investigate and arrest several gamblers on the spot, along with two decks of poker as gambling paraphernalia. Just as they were being escorted to the bureau, the gamblers sounded gongs to gather a crowd of more than 200 people, who snatched away the arrested gamblers and the gambling paraphernalia. Subsequently, the sub-bureau dispatched police officers again and successively arrested six gamblers: Hua Jun, Lü Peiqing, Yang Zonghong, Wu Dadi, Wu Xiaodi, and Yang Xu's wife. However, patrol officers Shi Xueren and Chen Yongyi were both beaten and injured. It was later learned that Hua Jun used to gamble for a living in Shanghai and had recently returned to Wuxi. Yesterday, they were all escorted to the county for interrogation.</p>
<p>Fourth Day of Opening of Cocoon Filatures</p>
<p>This year's fresh cocoon harvest in the county is poor, and the quality of the cocoons varies greatly, resulting in different prices for cocoons from different routes. Yesterday was the fourth day of the opening of the cocoon filatures. The market was still crowded with goods, and the filatures that collected the most goods had about 100 loads per day each. The prices of cocoons from various routes are recorded as follows: Central Route, such as Zhoushanbang, Xixinqiao, etc., local species cocoons are 55-60 yuan per load, foreign species are 75 yuan.

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Cocoon Prices Gradually Increase</p>
<p>The cocoon prices set by the cocoon filatures in various townships of Wu County on the 26th have increased compared to the previous few days.

<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Yu Zuwang</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the news about Ling Xiying's request for divorce in the Qingpu column of your newspaper on May 14, it is completely inconsistent with the facts. My client's name is Qi Ying, not Xi Ying. Her engagement with Cheng Zuxin was not only arranged by matchmakers and parents, but also repeatedly requested and agreed to by Cheng himself. Now that Cheng is about to graduate from university, he suddenly wants to cancel the engagement. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit with the county government to confirm its validity, not to request a divorce. Furthermore, Yongchun and is a tea shop, not a tea and food shop. The amount of compensation is also not 1,500 yuan. There are more discrepancies in the court interrogation and answers. I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Yu Zuwang, May 22.</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Export Trade Affected by US Tax Increases</h3>
<p>Twenty-three Items Subject to Increased Taxes</p>
<p>Yesterday, the commercial attache's office of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai announced that the recent US proposal to revise the import tariff regulations has been agreed upon and passed by both houses of Congress. The new tariff rates will be announced soon. Among them, there are several types of tax-free products that have been changed to taxable products, and there are also several types of goods for which the import tariff rates have been increased. In total, there are 23 types of Japanese imported goods that will be subject to the changed tariff rates. The total import value averages approximately 14 million gold dollars per year. After the new tariff rates are implemented, the tax revenue will increase by 3.3 million gold dollars. This is the new loss that Japanese merchants will suffer in the future. Analyzing the content of the goods subject to the new tariff rates, the largest items include soybean oil, porcelain, soybean cakes, dried bean curd, silk fabrics, and several others. Japanese goods account for approximately 10% to 36% of these items. The majority of the rest are Chinese export goods. Therefore, the actual losses that China's trade with the United States will suffer in the future will be several times greater than those of Japan.</p>
<h3>Naval Department Continues to Build Warships</h3>
<p>In addition to the Minquan warship, which has been completely completed, and the Yixian warship, which has also begun construction, the Naval Department is also planning to build another warship at the Jiangnan Shipyard.

<h3>British Naval Instructors</h3>
<p>Departing for Fujian by Ship Tomorrow</p>

It is rumored that the two arrived in Shanghai from the United Kingdom the other day and immediately transferred to Beijing to meet with naval authorities.

<h3>Do Not Arbitrarily Detain Crew Members in Accidental Ship Collisions</h3>
<p>Letter from the Shipping Association to the Municipal Public Safety Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association sent a letter yesterday to the Special Municipal Public Safety Bureau, stating: "Regarding the matter of our association's member ships' navigating officers, who have all been granted certificates by the Ministry of Transportation based on their qualifications and permitted to work by various customs offices, they are certainly not comparable to those who are merely pretending to be competent. However, navigation is a transportation undertaking, and ships are inherently mobile. During voyages, collisions often occur due to turbulent tides, shaking from wind and waves, dense fog, or the need to avoid other ships. These are all related to the weather and driven by circumstances. However, once the fault in such incidents is judged, the truth will be clear. We have observed that in various countries, the common practice when such incidents occur is for the on-site officials or police to first record the names of the ships and people involved for future investigation and judgment. This is because shipowners are reputable merchants and crew members have verifiable records, ensuring that there is no risk of evasion and that someone is held accountable. This approach respects the law, avoids arbitrary detention, and allows crew members to continue their duties, without hindering navigation. This demonstrates the importance that various countries place on shipping merchants, and their shipping industries have developed for a reason. Currently, in our country, when large and small merchant ships in the Huangpu River occasionally collide, the water police often fail to investigate the circumstances and immediately detain the ship's captain. Before the truth is determined, they are already imprisoned, and the ship is left without a captain, causing it to stop. Both shipping and transportation are hampered. We believe that operating shipping businesses requires significant capital investment, and most companies are established within the city limits. Shipowners are indeed reputable, and crew members are qualified. If collisions occur, someone will be held accountable, and there is no risk of evasion. We urge your bureau to instruct its subordinates and the water police that in the future, when collisions involving our association's member ships, large or small merchant vessels, or tugboats occur, the officials on the scene should record the ship names and obtain the signatures of the respective ship captains or chief mates as evidence, to be used for investigation and judgment at the company level, before any punishment is imposed. Please do not summarily detain or imprison the ship captain or chief mate on the spot, to avoid the injustice of being imprisoned before the truth is determined, and to prevent the ship from being left without a captain, causing it to stop and hindering navigation, resulting in unnecessary losses to fixed transportation and impacting the shipping industry immensely. Therefore, we enclose a roster of our association members and a list of ship names for your reference. We respectfully submit this letter, hoping that you will consider and approve the issuance of instructions to facilitate navigation and uphold public interests."</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Government Sends Representatives to Negotiate Over British Ships' Illegal Physical Examinations of Chinese Workers</h3>
<p>Mayor of the Special Municipality of Shanghai, Zhang Qun, previously received a letter from the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, No. 258, stating in brief, "Our committee previously received a report from the First Directly Subordinate District Branch, requesting that the National Government negotiate to improve the illegal physical examination of Chinese workers by the British-owned Gellatly Hankey &amp; Co. According to a report from Zhu Zhangliang of the district branch, 'We are suffering from economic pressure, leading us to work for the British-owned Gellatly Hankey &amp; Co. However, the company's unreasonable humiliation of our Chinese workers often fills us with resentment. When we Chinese workers first arrive at any ship of the company to work, we must undergo their illegal physical examination. They force dozens of us Chinese workers to strip naked and line up in a row, with our hands on the ground, just like cattle and horses, calling it a physical examination, but intending to insult us. If our government does not negotiate quickly, it will not only insult Chinese workers and lose the meaning of physical examination, but it will also affect the national dignity. We recall the past and lament the future. For the sake of our Chinese workers and for the sake of national dignity, we specially submit this report, requesting that it be forwarded to the higher-level party headquarters, requesting that the National Government quickly negotiate with the company to improve the method of examining Chinese workers' bodies to avoid insulting Chinese workers.' Physical examinations are recognized by all countries in the world, but such illegal methods of examination are unique to this company. We respectfully request that your department examine and verify this report, requesting that the National Government seriously negotiate to improve its method of examining Chinese workers' bodies, so as to respect human rights." Mayor Zhang believed that the British-owned Gellatly Hankey &amp; Co.'s illegal physical examination of Chinese workers not only insulted Chinese workers but also damaged national dignity. Therefore, a protest should be lodged to promote the improvement of their examination methods to uphold human dignity. In addition to replying to the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, he specially appointed Cen Dezhang, a secretary of the municipal government, to go to the British Consulate-General in Shanghai to lodge a serious protest and properly negotiate the matter.</p>

<p>Polish representative Weidengtao was previously scheduled to go to Beijing the evening before last (the 26th) to meet with Hu Shize, Director of the Asian Department, to continue negotiations on the Sino-Polish trade treaty, as instructed by his government. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the trip was cancelled. Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, Mr. Wei went to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Fenglin Bridge to visit Directors Chen and Liu, and planned to meet with Director Hu Shize to discuss the Sino-Polish trade treaty.

<h3>Municipal Government Plans to Build Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall</h3>
<p>To commemorate the Premier, the municipal government will build a large-scale Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in the central area of the city, which will also serve as a civic assembly hall.

<h3>Sale of the China and Foreign Telephone Company</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Has Expressed Support for the Tender Principle</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that after the advisory committee recommended accepting the tender from the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (ITT) regarding the sale of the China and Foreign Telephone Company, it is reported that the Public Works Department has expressed support in principle. It is now awaiting the decision of the French Municipal Council (FMC). Once the FMC has made a decision, a special shareholders' meeting will be convened to make a final decision.</p>
<p>Minister of Transportation Wang Boqun, recognizing the urgent need for China to recover the telephone business in the Shanghai concessions and operate it under the ministry's management, has repeatedly urged the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to actively negotiate with the concession authorities. He aims to overturn the original proposal that ITT has the right to purchase the telephone service in the concessions and to allow China to recover the service and operate it under the ministry's management by paying the price offered by ITT, thereby safeguarding national rights and preserving the interests of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Jiangzhe Fisheries Federation Telegraphs for Relief of Fishermen</h3>
<p>Recently, the fishing season in the Jiangzhe waters has been booming, which is most related to the livelihoods of fishermen for the year. However, pirates are taking the opportunity to emerge, and incidents of fishing boats being robbed are increasing daily. Recently, there have been widespread rumors in the waters that a large number of drifting net boats were robbed in the Lishe Sea area on the 12th and 14th of this month, with dozens of boats involved. Subsequently, surviving crew members from the distressed boats went to the Jiangzhe Fisheries Federation to report, confirming that 20 boats had been robbed and over 30 people had been kidnapped. Fishermen are alarmed by this news. Yesterday, the federation telegraphed the Nanjing National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, and the Jiangzhe Provincial Governments, requesting swift rescue and arrest. The original text is recorded as follows: "(To the Nanjing National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government in Hangzhou) We have just received reports from Zhong Axing, Cai Siduo, and other drifting net boat owners of our affiliated association that on the first and second days of this month, a large number of people and boats were robbed by bandits in the Lishe Sea area. Please report this immediately and request rescue and arrest. After investigation, it has been confirmed that 20 fishing boats were robbed at that time, and over 30 people, including Zhao Qiuyue, were kidnapped. The bandits are Wang Bonan, Li Zhiqing, and Jin Youbao from the north bank of Linhai. At this time when the fishing season is at its peak, marine bandits are so rampant that how can the common people make a living? In addition to sending separate telegrams, we request that you order your subordinates to set a deadline for the pursuit and arrest to alleviate the suffering. We eagerly await your response. Lin Heyong, etc., of the Dinghai Daishan Fisheries Federation bow their heads in earnest supplication."</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Collects Security Surtax Along with Cocoon Tax</h3>
<p>Limited to One Year</p>
<p>This year, a 10% security fee has been newly added to the cocoon tax in Zhejiang Province. The Shanghai Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the province, urging them to postpone the collection. Yesterday, they received a reply telegram from the province, the original text of which is recorded as follows: "(To the Shanghai Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce) We received your telegram of the other day. After investigating the matter of collecting a 10% security surtax along with the cocoon tax this year, limited to one year, it has been approved by the 308th meeting of our government committee and ordered the Department of Finance to comply. As this matter concerns the public interest of maintaining peace and order in this province, we hope you will convey this to the public and work together to overcome the difficulties and bear the burden. Special reply from the Zhejiang Provincial Government." With this, the surtax is indeed limited to one year, and it will not become a permanent example. Cocoon merchants must understand this and no longer raise objections.</p>
<h3>The Reaction to the Heavy Taxation of Stamp Duty on the Medical Profession</h3>
<p>Petition from the National Physicians Association</p>
<p>The National Physicians Association reported that, according to a report from its member Suzhou Physicians Association, the Wuxian Stamp Tax Bureau in Suzhou was heavily taxing the Suzhou medical profession with stamp duty. The association believes that the practice of medicine is different from commercial business, and that the bureau has arbitrarily added various harsh and detailed rules outside the scope of the stamp duty regulations, which is extremely illegal. The National Physicians Association held a meeting and unanimously resolved that, as the matter involves excessive taxation and is without legal basis, it should petition the Ministries of Health and Finance for an interpretation to exempt them from paying taxes and to prevent extortion. The association's petition is recorded below: "A petition for the Wuxian Stamp Tax Bureau's illegal and excessive taxation, which is causing real difficulty. We respectfully present the facts of the matter and request an interpretation for compliance. We believe that stamp duty is a fair tax because its scope is clearly defined and the tax rate is low. Even with the compulsory nature of taxation, there is still some discretion. Therefore, those who implement it should adhere to the principle of not disturbing the people. However, the Wuxian Stamp Tax Bureau issued a letter to the Suzhou Physicians Association regarding stamp duty regulations, with an added page of notes. In addition to the items in the original regulations, various fees were added. For example, for receipts, it was noted that hospitals and doctors should use receipts for hospitalization fees, surgery fees, amusement fees, consultation fees, sedan chair fees, transportation fees, appointment fees, etc. The association believes that this matter involves excessive taxation and is without legal basis. It sent a letter to its affiliated associations, convened a meeting, and publicly discussed that the practice of medicine is different from ordinary commercial business, and that the added notes seek to increase the burden on the people outside the national laws, which is clearly contrary to the principle that constitutional countries do not bear tax obligations without legal basis. It is difficult to comply and requested the Ministry to interpret and inform the bureau. Now, the association has forwarded the bureau's rebuttal of six items on April 21 and reconvened all members to discuss publicly. All agree that the nature of stamp duty is to maintain the credibility of account books, contracts, and other items. In other words, affixing stamp duty in accordance with the law is evidence of compliance, not necessarily exhausting every penny. Why has the bureau arbitrarily added a page of notes, which is extremely illegal? We present the following points: (1) (Legislative power should not be arbitrarily misused.) Constitutional citizens do not bear tax obligations without legal basis. 'Law' has a certain procedure and a certain body. The bureau is not a legislative body and has no legislative power. It is inappropriate to add notes outside the original law, so that obligations arise from its notes for points not covered by the original law. This note is not legally permitted. Moreover, it specifically adds notes for the medical profession, not knowing what evil the medical profession has committed. All national laws should be universally applicable, but the note at the end adds special words for the medical profession. If there is no special prejudice, why do this? This note cannot avoid the suspicion of encroaching on legislative power. This is the first point. (2) (The nature of business should be interpreted narrowly.) Article 3 of the Stamp Duty Law has the words 'nature of business.' The word 'business' refers to ordinary commerce and industry, that is, the state levies business tax on commercial and industrial operators. As for doctors who earn income through scientific mental labor and bear the great obligation of protecting the lives of citizens, civilized countries only impose a small amount of income tax. Income tax is different from business tax, that is, the practice of medicine is not ordinary business. Japanese tax does not apply to this, nor do other countries. This is because the state respects their personality and gives special treatment. However, the bureau wants to treat doctors the same as merchants, which is a misunderstanding. If the interpretation of 'business' is expanded in this way, then schools, teachers, government agencies, and officials would all be businesses, which would be dangerous and strange. Therefore, the nature of business should be interpreted narrowly. This is the second point. (3) (Tax collection can be delayed to encourage development.) National tax systems have both prohibition and encouragement. In other words, for the encouragement of development, taxes are often exempted, such as exempting local duties on imitation machine-made foreign goods. Today, our country's medicine is still in its infancy, and we should actively promote its academic study. Why must we tax every fee? Those who do not know may suspect the intention of implicit prohibition. Even if the items listed in the notes are commonly taxed in various countries, our country's medicine is still in its infancy. It is permissible to proceed slowly. It is better to repair the net than to let a boat through. It is not a bad plan to borrow a chopstick to assist in planning. Therefore, taxation can be delayed to encourage development. This is the third point. (4) (Trivial and cumbersome matters inevitably hinder proper duties.) Seeking medical treatment is also what those who hope for a healthy society like to do. Doctors treat people every day, mostly according to the patient's payment, without carefully checking and calculating. If it is for affixing stamp duty, it is necessary to check each item, which takes a lot of time and feels awkward. Moreover, a receipt must be issued for affixing stamp duty, and the receipt cannot be without a stub. This kind of filling in and consuming time may hinder diagnosis and treatment. The state's revenue is only one or two cents, but the doctor's cost is more than one or two cents, and the patient's loss is difficult to calculate. If the state really wants to consider the interests of taxpayers, it would be better to collect a small head tax from doctors, which would be less harmful. Therefore, trivial and cumbersome matters inevitably hinder proper duties. This is the fourth point. (5) (Incorrectly levying stamp duty will inevitably cause ridicule.) The micro-tax system is to collect from those who benefit from it. Doctors do not benefit from prescribing medicine, but pharmacies can benefit after selling medicine. However, there is a separate invoice after selling medicine that can be taxed. If doctors are required to affix stamp duty to prescriptions, it is not known where the source of taxation comes from. I am afraid that all the financial experts in the world cannot find the answer. This kind of wrong tax collection will inevitably cause ridicule from the world. This is the fifth point. In short, if stamp duty is to be maintained as a fair tax, it should focus on the big and distant, not the small and near. Doctors' mental labor and life should be relaxed. The association has heard that the bureau has adopted a commercial contracting system. If the country's politics are all entrusted to merchants, no wonder what they see and think is all about commerce. If medicine is commercialized, there will be Shennong and the Yellow Emperor a thousand years from now. The association's patriotic heart is long and does not feel the pain of its words. We respectfully request that your departments examine and verify, and give a detailed interpretation to exempt us from taxation, so as to benefit the people's livelihood and the medical profession. This will be fortunate for the people. We respectfully submit this petition to Liu, Minister of Health of the National Government, and Song, Minister of Finance of the National Government.

<h3>Pen and Ink Industry Requests Tax Reduction</h3>
<p>The national pen and ink industry will organize an association to request the National Government to reduce taxes. Due to the increasing tariffs and taxes in recent years, sales have gradually declined. If they do not unite urgently, they fear that the thousands-year-old national essence will be defeated by imported goods. Therefore, industry members recently discussed and elected a temporary committee of 19 people, including Hu Mingsheng, Hang Shuquan, and Hu Hongkai, to wait for industry members from various ports to gather before publicly electing representatives to petition the National Government. They have now selected No. 5, Lane 44, Huacaobang, Xiaodongmen, as their office.</p>
<h3>News on the Placement of Unemployed Workers in the Pharmaceutical Industry Yesterday</h3>
<p>Instruction from the Chairman of the National Government to Handle the Matter According to Law</p>
<p>The dispute over the placement of unemployed workers in the pharmaceutical industry has been ongoing since the Commercial Readjustment Association convened a plenary meeting and publicly elected Yu Qiaqing and other six representatives to petition various agencies in Beijing and Shanghai, striving to revoke the order for placement. Contacts and progress have been made in the past few days. The details of each item are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chairman of the National Government's Instruction: The Commercial Readjustment Association yesterday received official letter No. 3465 from the Civil Affairs Office of the National Government, stating that "The Chairman has forwarded your association's telegram requesting that the order for the placement of unemployed workers in the pharmaceutical industry be revoked for consideration. It is hereby instructed that the placement of unemployed workers should not be compulsory. It should be sent to the Central Party Headquarters and handed over to the Unemployment Problem Research Committee for deliberation and shall also be telegraphed to the Shanghai Municipal Government for handling in accordance with the law." In addition to sending separate letters and telegrams, a corresponding letter is hereby issued for your information and compliance.</p>
<p>Representatives Running Around: The representatives of the Commercial Readjustment Association, including Yu Qiaqing, invited responsible personnel from the municipal party and government agencies on the 25th to exchange views and discuss solutions. On the 26th, they convened representatives of the pharmaceutical industry to the Commercial Readjustment Association for discussions. The representatives of the pharmaceutical industry took a very firm stance and stated that no matter what, the industry could not accept any compulsory recruitment measures and would not spare any sacrifice. The Commercial Readjustment Association, as a group representing merchants, should strive to protect the interests of the industry and not allow the industry to suffer losses because other industries may receive guarantees that they will not be used as precedents. It is reported that the representatives, with the determination of the pharmaceutical industry, should base their actions on the mission entrusted to them by the plenary meeting and strive for justice.</p>
<p>Representatives' Statements: The representatives of the Commercial Readjustment Association, Yu Qiaqing, Ye Huijun, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, Wen Lanting, and other five committee members, formally stated the following reasons for requesting the central government to revoke the placement order: (1) The employer's sole right to hire workers should be determined (a) based on their own business conditions and (b) based on the skills and character of the employee. Only they themselves know best the advantages and disadvantages, and no one else can plan for them. Countries only adopt unemployment introduction and unemployment insurance systems to provide relief for the unemployed, and there are absolutely no cases where political power is used to force businesses to accommodate a large number of unemployed workers, because the completeness of the employer's right to hire workers is closely related to the survival of the store. Furthermore, regarding the so-called qualified unemployed workers, the store's criteria for hiring people should be based on their skills, proficiency, and ability to abide by store rules. Therefore, only the store that has worked with them for many years can deeply understand their situation. If the proposal is made by an outsider, the result will inevitably be contrary. As for the claim that reactionary elements will be mixed in, the store regards reactionary elements as if they were snakes and scorpions. Their fear and desire to reject them is as clear as the sun and the stars. There is absolutely no reason to open the door to let thieves in and bring disaster upon themselves. This is the second point that should be clarified. Since this matter has been in stalemate for so long, the only way to seek a win-win situation is to petition the central government and have the Commercial Readjustment Association and pharmaceutical industry organizations select those among the unemployed workers who are docile and strive to take responsibility for introducing them, which is in line with the wishes of the party and government authorities to work hard to provide relief for unemployed workers and does not conflict with the employer's right to hire people.</p>
<p>Commercial Readjustment Association's Reply to the Pharmaceutical Association: The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association previously rejected the forced placement of unemployed workers by labor unions. In addition to repeatedly sending representatives to Beijing to petition, they also sent a letter to the Commercial Readjustment Association, requesting them to strive for justice. Now, they have received a reply from the Commercial Readjustment Association, which stated, "Regarding official letter No. 3465 from the Civil Affairs Office of the National Government, which stated that the Chairman has forwarded your association's telegram, stating that the association protested the forced placement of unemployed workers in the industry, which caused a strike, and stated the reasons why they could not be placed. Subsequently, they received six points of the central government's decision, and now they reiterate each one and request that we strive for justice for them, and it was deemed that the most intense point of contention in this case was the forced placement, and the employees of each industry are now preparing to rise up and invoke the precedent. Each industry views this as a huge crisis and intends to request that the order for the placement of unemployed workers be revoked. Please consider and approve this case and was deemed that the placement of unemployed workers should not be compulsory. It should be sent to the Central Party Headquarters and handed over to the Unemployment Problem Research Committee for deliberation and should also be telegraphed to the Shanghai Municipal Government for handling in accordance with the law. This case has been submitted to the central party headquarters by the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and now, we have received the aforementioned official letter. This letter is being transferred for your information and compliance. Additionally, the Pharmaceutical Industry Association has raised the cases where our delegation members Feng Jinpu and Tong Hanchun, assistant manager Song Fuchen was illegally arrested separately by union officials, was also handed to the Commerical Readjustment Association requesting that it send letters to the Shanghai Party, Political and Military organizations to severely punish the union, and received the reply below, which states 'The cases where Yao Ye Workers illegal apprehended the Deputy Manager to Tong Hanchun, was added to the Feng Jinpu case where we asked the Party, Political and Military officials to suppress the situation while punishing in accordance with the law, on the 26th of this month, the Songhu Garrison replied for Yao Ye Workers Association for the illegal apprehension the situation has been corrected strictly" and it will send letters to Municipal Party Officials and the Social Bureau to investigate and the Municipal Police to present the situation so we can process the details accordingly.</p>
<h3>Method for Transfer and Registration of Party Members</h3>
<p>Revised Again</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Commercial Affairs Commission yesterday received Notice Pu Zi No. 19 from the Organization Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, stating, "Regarding the matter of notifying all matters, we have received Instruction No. 690 from the Central Executive Committee, which states that party members in various places sometimes fail to complete the transfer and registration procedures due to transfers, or request transfer to the district branch in the area they have arrived in without holding a transfer certificate, which is a violation of the party's organization and discipline. In order to prevent this abuse, the 90th Standing Committee meeting has re-edited the 'Party Member Transfer and Registration Method' passed and issued by the 151st Standing Committee meeting of the previous session. In addition to distributing it, we hereby order its issuance. We urge the party headquarters to comply immediately and forward it to its subordinate party headquarters and party members to ensure strict compliance." Attached is a copy of the revised "Party Member Transfer and Registration Method." We hereby urgently notify you to comply and instruct all subordinates to comply together.</p>

<h3>Japanese Consul in Beijing Ordered to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>To Personally Present Important Matters</p>
<p>The Japanese Consul in Beijing, Uemura, was summoned by telegram by Chargé d'Affaires Shigimitsu the other day and came to Shanghai by train. Yesterday, he met with Chargé d'Affaires Shigimitsu to personally present the investigation into the National Government's promulgation of the ban on the import and export of gold and silver, as well as the inside story, and reported on the informal negotiations regarding Sino-Japanese legal rights. Since Chargé d'Affaires Shigimitsu is about to return to his country, all important matters urgently need to be discussed in person. Therefore, they deliberated in the office all day. In the evening, after finishing the official business, he took a train back to Beijing. Chargé d'Affaires Shigimitsu had a meeting with Foreign Minister Wang once last week. He originally intended to meet with Foreign Minister Wang again this week as a farewell talk and to exchange opinions on various negotiations.

<h3>Wu Guangzong Appointed Director of the Hydrographic Survey Bureau</h3>
<p>Assumes Office on June 1st</p>
<p>After Xie Baozhang, Director of the Hydrographic Survey Bureau of the Navy Department in Fenglin Bridge, this municipality, resigned, the bureau affairs were temporarily managed by the bureau's Chief Mi.

After Wu received the order, he was approved to take office at the bureau on June 1st.</p>
<h3>County Construction Bureau Submits Request for Approval of North Hui Road Budget</h3>
<p>The subgrade of the North Hui County Road in Shanghai County has already been completed and inspected by personnel dispatched by the Jiangsu Construction Department. Therefore, Director Wu of the County Construction Bureau has drafted a plan budget for the road surface, bridges, culverts, etc., and has submitted it to the county government for transmission to the Jiangsu Construction Department for review and approval. As soon as the order is approved, contractors will be invited to undertake the construction. It is estimated that the county road can be completed in three months. Director Wu believes that, now that it is the busy farming season, several places on the completed subgrade have been damaged, with farmers digging away one or two feet of soil, and the open ditches along the road have also been damaged. If the road surface is not paved quickly, it will inevitably collapse and deteriorate. Furthermore, during the upcoming rainy season, there is a risk of erosion, which would cause great damage and make reorganization difficult, or even require a second requisition of labor, which would be time-consuming and delay the project. Therefore, he yesterday submitted a sincere request to the county government for transmission to the Jiangsu Construction Department for prompt approval to facilitate the progress. Niu Yongjian, the Minister of Interior Affairs, is extremely concerned about the construction of his hometown and pays particular attention to the North Hui County Road. He has also sent a letter to Sun, the Director of the Construction Department, requesting prompt approval so that the North Hui County Road can be completed as soon as possible.</p>

Furthermore, personnel were dispatched to investigate the address where Martyr Xu lived at the time of his death, and it was reported that his family had moved away two years ago and their whereabouts are unknown, etc. Because the association's disbursement of pensions has already been decided and will end on June 30th, there are few days left. We are enclosing a copy of the table of Martyr Xu's age, origin, and address, and request your government to order the district chiefs, township heads, and neighborhood leaders under your jurisdiction to be responsible for thoroughly investigating and notifying Martyr Xu's family to come to the association to register, submit evidence of martyrdom, and await investigation to ensure accurate identification and disbursement of pensions.

<h3>Interpretation of Absence Issues in Labor-Management Disputes</h3>
<p>The Special Municipality of Shanghai previously submitted a case to the Executive Yuan for interpretation regarding whether a meeting could be held for arbitration in the event of the absence of a labor-management arbitration committee member. The Executive Yuan then transferred it to the Judicial Yuan for consultation. According to the response, "The arbitration of labor-management disputes shall be conducted by the consensus of all committee members. This has been stipulated in Articles 12, 13, and 31 of the Labor-Management Dispute Handling Law. Therefore, the committee must have all five members present to arbitrate the case. If one member is unable to perform their duties, a representative with the same qualifications shall be appointed to fill the position, depending on the type of representative as defined in Article 13, and another meeting shall be held." After review by the President of the Yuan, the response was forwarded and ordered to be followed by the Special Municipality of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Records of the Jiangsu Provisional Relief Association</h3>

A telegram was received from Suqian stating that continuous heavy rains had caused the water level to rise and begging for immediate relief. (4) Director Zhang telegraphed that relief in Jiangyin had been completed and requested prompt remittance of funds. (5) Director Zhu telegraphed that relief in Xing would be opened on a specific date. (6) Mr. Li Zhenqing sent a letter from the Jiangdu Relief Sub-Association requesting the issuance of 2,400 yuan of relief funds allocated by the province, which Chairman Huang Boyu has replied to in a letter. (7) Director Gong reported that 37,935 yuan of relief funds had been distributed for relief in Fu. (8) Number of relief funds received this week.

It was resolved that a telegram would be sent in reply that the 4,500 yuan allocated by the province had already been received by the association and used to cover expenses and could not be allocated again.

<h3>Recent Situation of the Disaster in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Sun Weizhu, the representative of the Shaanxi Relief Association stationed in Shanghai, recently received a express mail telegram from the Shaanxi Disaster Situation Communication Agency reporting on the recent situation of the disaster in Shaanxi. The details are recorded below for the attention of various philanthropists (salutations omitted): "Given that there was heavy rain in Xi'an for one day and night on April 13th, the weather suddenly turned cold, which damaged the wheat seedlings. Furthermore, on this day, the southeastern district of Chang'an County experienced hailstorms mixed with rain, with hailstones as large as walnuts. The district's low-lying terrain allowed for harvesting and sowing last year despite the drought, and the wheat has now gone from sprouting to earing. Suddenly, it was beaten and broken clean, which is truly a bolt from the blue for the farmers in the district. Fortunately, the land has received sufficient moisture, and there is hope for farming. However, after the people have suffered this calamity, they have land but no seeds, and seeds but no livestock. The land has been barren for two years, with weeds as tall as a person's legs. How can the hungry people cultivate it? Although the Provincial Relief Association, Shanghai Jisheng Association, Hankou Tongyuan Relief Association, Sino-Foreign Relief Association, and Beiping Xiaohui School, and other major philanthropists have distributed seeds and funds, the disaster area is vast and cannot be covered universally. According to statistics from Shaanxi Province, which experienced rainfall last autumn, only one-tenth of the province was able to sow due to the lack of both wheat seeds and livestock. Even if there is a bumper harvest this summer, it will only be a drop in the bucket. Now, with the transition between the old and new harvests, the number of people fleeing from various counties to the province is increasing daily. The various charitable organizations have limited capacity for accommodation, resulting in 20 to 30 people still starving to death on the streets and alleys every day. The tragic scene is unbearable to witness. It is deeply hoped that major philanthropists will continue to provide assistance for rescue."</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of the Hailstorm in Henan Province</h3>
<p>Zhou Xiaofan, the Henan Relief Representative stationed in Shanghai, recently received a telegram from the province, stating:</p>
<p>(Salutations omitted) "The disasters in Henan in recent years are too numerous to describe in words. On the evening of April 11th, a sudden hailstorm occurred in Hualeli, Song County, lasting for several hours. The large ones were the size of bowls, and the thick ones were over a foot. The damage covered over forty li from east to west and over thirty li from north to south. Houses were damaged, and crops were destroyed. The disaster situation was extremely tragic. On the evening of May 4th, a sudden hurricane arose in the Dengfeng area, including Dalielu and Liequgaodeng districts, accompanied by blowing sand and rocks, thunder, lightning, and hail. The large ones weighed several pounds, and the small ones were the size of goose eggs. It lasted for about an hour, with the accumulated thickness exceeding one foot. Fields and houses within fifty li were mostly damaged. Residents were killed by the hailstones, and birds and animals were injured and dead everywhere. At the same time, Gong County also suffered from severe winds and hailstorms, with hailstones ranging in size from chicken eggs to walnuts and dates. The hailstorm lasted for about two hours, and no place in the county was spared. On the morning of the 6th, dense fog obscured visibility. Wen County in Hebei Province also suffered a hailstorm on the same day, with roughly the same tragic situation. At this time, when the old and new harvests are transitioning and the wheat is blooming, the sudden disaster has made the harvest hopeless. Alas, these disaster victims will have nothing to rely on. I have reported the tragic disaster situation separately and telegraphed to various charitable organizations in Shanghai, earnestly requesting prompt relief. I hope that your representative will appeal to various Sino-foreign charitable organizations and major philanthropists on our behalf. If we are granted the blessing of generosity and grain, countless disaster victims will be grateful for our rebirth." It is reported that Representative Zhou Xiaofan wept and begged for relief from various charitable organizations after receiving this telegram.</p>

<h3>Returning Overpaid Currency</h3>
<p>Ke Feng, Student at National Central University</p>
<p>The Dingyuan Exchange Shop on Wusong Road, this municipality, recently had National Central University students Xu Fei and others exchange Japanese currency for national currency (Xu and others had returned from studying in Japan). A shop employee mistakenly overpaid them forty-five yuan in national currency. Only after Xu and others returned to their residence did they realize the mistake. They specially hired a car to rush back to the shop to ask if there had been any error. At the time, the shop employee had not yet noticed and answered vaguely. Xu then told them their name and address in order to return the money. After the shop realized the mistake, Xu and others had already returned to the capital. Subsequently, Zhang Xieshu, the manager of the shop, sent a letter to Mr. Xu explaining the mistake and expressing his apologies. Mr. Xu then remitted the forty-five yuan back to the shop in full. The shop manager and employees were overjoyed by Mr. Xu's high moral character and expressed their gratitude.</p>
<h3>Threatening Letter Depicts a Handgun</h3>
<p>Dismissed Employee Holds Grudge Against Factory Owner</p>
<p>Sends Letter Demanding a Thousand Gold Pieces</p>
<p>Arrested, Interrogated, and Sentenced to a Year and a Half</p>
<p>Qiu Weilong, the owner of the Hengchang Machine Factory at 332 Zhoujiazui Road, received two threatening letters from the 19th to the 24th of this month, demanding 1,000 yuan. The wording was extremely severe, and the letters even depicted a handgun, indicating that if the money was not given, they would resort to using a handgun. Qiu observed that the handwriting of the two letters was the same as that of Yin Litang, a dismissed employee from Ningbo. He reported this to the Huishan Police Station, which dispatched detective Zhai Yanting to arrest Yin near the factory on the afternoon of the previous day. Yesterday morning, Yin was sent to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Feng Shide conducted the interrogation. Qiu and the hired workers and apprentices Li Jun and Qiu Xiaotu all testified that the threatening letters were indeed sent by the defendant and submitted the two letters as evidence. Yin confessed that he had worked at Hengchang before, but was dismissed by the plaintiff for no reason last autumn, and had been unemployed ever since. He hated Qiu so much that he sent the letters, but claimed that the purpose was not money. Judge Feng, after the defendant admitted to sending the threatening letters, immediately sentenced Yin Litang to one year and six months of imprisonment and confiscated the threatening letters.</p>
<h3>Notorious Bandit Cao Jinbiao and Others Found to Have Repeatedly Committed Crimes</h3>
<p>Xie, Shen, and Zhou Three Kidnapping Cases</p>
<p>Investigation Shows Cao and Others Were Responsible</p>
<p>The Gordon Road Police Station and the General Inspectorate of the General Police Department successively arrested 24 male and female bandits, including Cao Jinbiao, who were responsible for major cases of robbing residents, shooting police officers, and kidnapping people for ransom. They also seized a total of four handguns and box cannons and 374 bullets. Further investigation revealed that, in addition to several accomplices being involved in the robbery of the family of Gu Xiaomao, a villager on Changping Road, for 343 yuan worth of property, and resisting arrest and shooting Officer Liu Youqing of No. 463, it was also discovered that the kidnapping of Xie Baosheng's son, Songtao, the compradore of the Xinming Steamboat, the kidnapping of a university student, Shen Huiyi, who lived at 22 Wuding Road, and the kidnapping of Zhou Zengyu, who was studying at Gezhi Public School, after which he resisted the bandits and managed to escape, were all related to Cao Jinbiao. Furthermore, it was determined that one of the seized box cannons, serial number 710877, was used as a weapon to resist arrest when Zhou Zengyu was being kidnapped. At that time, a pedestrian, Zhu Xucai, was actually injured by the box cannon. In addition, it was discovered that Wang Shoulian, one of the other bandits, had also conspired with others on February 11th to rob residents of property at 188 Parker Road. Yesterday afternoon, the police sent the defendants to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Sun Yuan opened the trial. First, the police lawyer requested that eight male and female defendants, including Xiao Zhilong, Zhang Zhongli, Shen Huanzhang, Wang Zhaoyin, Liu Mingde, Xu Guizhi, and Liu Wangshi, be released because there was no evidence of their crimes. Judge Sun immediately approved the request and ordered their release. The lawyer then stated that, although it had not yet been determined whether three male and female defendants, including Zhang Anfu, Li Wushi, and Song Songshi, had committed robbery or kidnapping, firearms were found in their residences, so they were temporarily charged with violating the regulations on banning military firearms. As for the remaining 13 defendants, including Cao Jinbiao, they were requested to be tried according to the various crimes they had committed. Li Chengzhang, a witness in the Xie Songtao kidnapping case, was then called to testify. Li stated that he was a relative of Xie Baosheng and lived with him at 817 Baker Road. On the night of March 22nd, several bandits broke into Xie's house, robbed them, and kidnapped Xie's son. He saw Cao Jinbiao holding a gun at the scene. Next, Zhang Baisheng, a witness in the Shen case, testified that 22 Wuding Road was the office of his son, lawyer Zhang Jie. Shen Huiyi, who was kidnapped, rented a room upstairs. On the night of April 15th, four or five kidnappers suddenly tricked their way into the door. One bandit held two handguns and went straight upstairs. After a while, he came downstairs. Because he had been held in the downstairs room by the bandits, he did not know what was happening. After the bandits left, he found a note and learned that Shen had been kidnapped. He still has no news of him. Shen is also from Jiangbei and came to Shanghai to study at Xinmin University. When asked if the defendants were the bandits that night, he could not identify them. When questioned, Song Songshi confessed that he worked in the same factory as Li Wushi and that the handgun was stored at his house by Cao Jinbiao. Cao confessed that the firearms actually belonged to Chen Bixiang, who was the leader and had hundreds of followers and many firearms. The gun was stored at Song Songshi's house by Chen. In the Xie family case on Baker Road, Chen ordered me to transport the firearms from Hongkou to their house in a chartered car. I was the driver, and Chen and I entered the house to rob and kidnap. However, I did not know where the kidnapped child was hidden, nor did I receive any money. When Shen was kidnapped, I went with four others, but I did not go inside. I saw them escort a young man in a suit out and put him in a car driven by Hou Awu to Rihui Port, where he was hidden on a boat guarded by three people. However, when I led the detectives to investigate after my arrest, the boat was gone. Judge Sun ordered that the 16 male and female defendants, including Cao, be remanded in custody separately and rescheduled for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Public Security and Public Utilities Bureaus Issue Notices to Protect the New Zhabei Power Plant</h3>
<p>The new power plant of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company is about to be completed. The company's workers have begun transporting the fuel and spare parts needed for power generation. However, local gangsters led by Zhang Aisheng have often interfered with the loading and unloading of these items, extorting money and gathering crowds to cause trouble. The other day, when the factory was transporting coal, Zhang actually wrote a note to prevent them from carrying it themselves. The note was printed with the words "Foreman of the New Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant." The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company reported that Zhang was interfering with the transportation of goods and falsely claiming to be a foreman, and requested the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to forward the report to the Public Security Bureau for investigation and prohibition. After receiving the report, the Public Utilities Bureau considered that the company's operation of water and electricity was related to municipal construction and that the work was particularly important at this time when the new power plant was about to generate electricity and should be protected. It immediately approved a joint notice with the Public Security Bureau stating that the loading and unloading of goods at the company's water and electricity plant should be carried out by the workers hired by the company and that no one should interfere. Anyone who violated this would be arrested and prosecuted. The Public Security Bureau was also ordered to strictly investigate and prohibit this in the district under its jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>Sino-Western Flower Association to Hold Spring Flower Show for Three Days</h3>
<p>Venue at the Great China Hotel</p>
<p>Non-Members May Also Join</p>
<p>The Shanghai Flower Association was founded fifty years ago by foreign residents in the concession to promote horticulture and flowers. It was renamed the Sino-Western Flower Association twenty-five years ago, and Chinese horticulture enthusiasts were then allowed to join as members. However, due to the imperfect organizational law in the beginning, very few Chinese joined under the management of Western directors. It was not until the previous year that Mr. Hui Yuting and Mr. Ding Runxiang joined as Chinese directors. Furthermore, Mr. Lan, an engineer from the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council, and Mr. Ka, the superintendent of parks, cooperated and made great efforts to promote and improve all facilities. The grand occasion of the last autumn chrysanthemum show is evident. This year's spring flower show is now scheduled to be held for three consecutive days, starting this Friday and Saturday, at the Great China Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. It has also been heard that, in order to promote Sino-Western horticulture and advancement, all horticulture enthusiasts, whether members or non-members, can join the competition with their rare flowers, agricultural products, fruits, and vegetables, regardless of their origin, be it Chinese or Western, and regardless of the distance of their gardens. Anyone who has a unique flower or art and is confident that they can impress the audience can register and obtain a certificate from the Superintendent of Parks' office in the building of the Public Works Department on the Third Road starting today in order to participate in the competition at that time. Mr. Ding and Mr. Hui will be in charge of judging on the Chinese side, and Mr. King, the British Assessor, will be the chief judge. It is heard that the Great China Hotel will hold grand tea dances and banquets every day during the flower show. When the time comes, the event will be crowded with people, and the streets will be packed with cars.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Orders Correction of Police Officers' Collar Badges</h3>
<p>Improvement in Accordance with National Government Promulgated Illustrations</p>
<p>The Municipal Government, believing that the style of the collar badges of police officers in various districts of the city did not conform to the police uniform regulations promulgated by the National Government, specially instructed the Public Security Bureau to investigate and make corrections in order to comply with the system. The original text read: "Regarding the issuance of instructions for the case, the police uniform regulations were previously promulgated by the National Government and have already been reissued for compliance.

The river was deep and rapid, and he disappeared immediately. Afterwards, the platoon leader took a roll call and discovered that the soldier who had drowned himself was named Guan Shushan, 23 years old, from Peixian County, Xuzhou. The reason for his suicide was mainly due to his inability to adjust to the hardships of military life.

<p>Wu Jiqing, a 22-year-old carpenter from Ningbo residing in a flat at 42 Hujia Muqiao, went to Jinling Road in Zhabei to visit his uncle, Wei Qing, after finishing work the day before yesterday evening. After dinner, Wu's son, Xihe, and a neighbor from Shandong, Li Qiongqing, played a dice game together. A conflict suddenly arose between Wu and Li, and they began to wrestle. Jiqing stepped forward to mediate when he saw his cousin being beaten, but Qiongqing kicked him forcefully in the head, causing Jiqing to hit the ground and clutch his head in pain. A police officer then took them to the police station. Jiqing was unable to walk at the time and had to hire a carriage. Qiongqing denied the assault, but acknowledged that Jiqing was injured and was detained in the judicial section. Jiqing sought medical treatment on his own, but Wei Qing mistakenly believed that Jiqing had a headache and did not send him to the hospital. As a result, Jiqing succumbed to his head injury from the kick and died at his residence on Hujia Muqiao yesterday afternoon. His housemate reported the incident to Wei Qing, who reported the situation to the Public Security Bureau, requesting that the murderer, Li Qiongqing, be punished to avenge the injustice.</p>

<h3>Continued Hearing of the Case Against the Former Promoters of Huang (Yellow) Taxi Company</h3>
<p>Plaintiff's Shares Still Not Submitted</p>
<p>The Public Yellow Taxi Company previously went bankrupt and is currently undergoing liquidation at the U.S. Consulate. The shareholders, holding 5,636 shares, filed a lawsuit in the former Provisional Court against the promoters of the company, Chen Yizhou, Guo Ding, Guo Shangxian, Deng Yicheng, and others, to recover the unpaid shares, totaling 56,360 yuan. The case has been heard several times and adjourned because the plaintiff needs to submit the shares for verification. The case was heard again yesterday morning by Judge Zhou Daren of the Special District Court. However, the plaintiff's shares were still not submitted. Their attorney stated that the shares were held by the liquidator and requested the court to retrieve them from the U.S. Consulate. The attorneys for the defendants, Chen Yizhou, Chen Tingrui, and Zheng Tianxi, argued that there was no reason to pursue the claim for unpaid shares as the plaintiff had not yet submitted the shares for verification. The attorneys for both sides debated the issue. Judge Zhou adjourned the hearing until June 24th in the morning.</p>

Since the criminal case had already been decided, he requested that the court grant a default judgment. He further stated that various tabloids had published inaccurate and defamatory reports since the case began, causing the plaintiff great pain and illness, and that her medical expenses were being borrowed from others. As for the facts of the case, it had already been clearly established that there was a significant age difference between the parties, and that the defendant had a history of frequenting prostitutes and suffered from a venereal disease. He requested that the court grant the plaintiff's request for divorce. Judge Yang concluded the arguments and scheduled the judgment for the morning of the 31st of this month.</p>
<h3>Woman Accused of Adultery Claims She Was Seduced Due to Being New to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Promises to Never Repeat Such Behavior</p>
<p>Chen Xiangzhou Continues to Deny Allegations</p>
<p>Mo, 27, the wife of Zhu Dianlun, a native of Hai'ning and owner of Huachang Quarry Company at 315 Nan'an Lane, Baike Road, was recently sued by her husband in the Special District Court for adultery with Chen Xiangzhou, a native of Ningbo. The trial was conducted by Judge Cheng Shangfeng the day before yesterday afternoon. Chen did not appear, and Mo was arrested at 344 Juqing Lane, Xinzha Road, and brought to court. She testified that she had committed adultery with Chen twice, both times under the threat of Chen's mother-in-law. The first time was in room 83 of the Tongshang Hotel on Avenue Joffre. Although Chen repeatedly provoked her, she did not comply. The second time was in room 72 of the Xingzhou Hotel on Dongxin Bridge, where Chen's mother-in-law accompanied her. After the mother-in-law left, it rained heavily, and she stayed there. Chen had sent his mother-in-law home before the rain. However, she suddenly heard a knock on the door in the middle of the night. She opened it, and Chen forced himself upon her. Judge Cheng ordered that the defendant be detained and that Chen Xiangzhou be arrested for further questioning. Yesterday afternoon, Chen was arrested by police at the Sanleyuan Teahouse on Avenue Foch in the French Concession and brought to the court. Judge Cheng then continued the trial. Chen testified that he had visited the hotel twice to ask Mo to introduce him to business opportunities because he had been fired by the plaintiff and had not been able to find a job since. He completely denied the adultery allegation. Mo insisted on her previous testimony and claimed that she was seduced because she was new to Shanghai and promised never to repeat such behavior. She expressed her willingness to return home with her husband. The plaintiff requested that she be punished according to the law. After arguments by the plaintiff's attorney, Judge Cheng ordered that both defendants be detained separately and that a date be set for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Young Girl Misplaced Her Trust</h3>
<p>Ma Yuansen Attempts to Lure Away</p>
<p>Xu Yindi, a fourteen-year-old girl from Anhui, of fair appearance, residing at No. 42 near Xianji Road in this city, was the daughter of Xu, who worked as a second mate on a foreign merchant ship and was often away from home. Her mother had recently returned to their hometown due to important matters, and before leaving, she entrusted her daughter Yindi to the care of Ma Yuansen, a rickshaw puller from Taixian living next door, fearing that Yindi would be unsupervised at home. Ma, however, was a wolf in sheep's clothing. Seeing Yindi's youth and vulnerability, he seized the opportunity to entice her away, intending to sell her back in Jiangbei for an unexpected profit. The unsuspecting girl fell into his trap, and they agreed to meet at the Ningshao Wharf at 6 p.m. the night before to board a ship together. When Yindi arrived at the wharf as agreed, she waited for a long time but Ma did not appear. Looking worried, she paced the shore, where she was spotted by Chen Songshan, an officer of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's River Patrol Team, who found her suspicious and questioned her. Yindi was evasive, so he took her back to the team. During a preliminary interrogation by Chief Xu, she claimed that she was planning to take a ship because her mother had returned to their hometown. The captain observed that the girl was too young to be traveling alone and suspected there was more to the story. After further questioning, Yindi confessed everything. The captain immediately dispatched Detective Yang Chunting to arrest Ma Yuansen. Under questioning, Ma's case was reported to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau on the grounds of abducting a young girl.</p>
<h3>Woman Pregnant Before Marriage</h3>
<p>Wedding Date Approaching, She Flees</p>
<p>Found by Her Father, She Elopes Again</p>
<p>Wu Xiaodi, a farmer from Panjiazhai, west of Longhua Town in Shanghai, has a daughter named A Jin, 24 years old. Since childhood, she was betrothed to Zhu Tugen, the son of Zhu Fengqing from Xiaoliujiazhai on Rue des Soeurs in the French Concession, with Pan Yinxiang and Tang Chuntao acting as matchmakers. The wedding date was set for May 29th, but the girl had already been having an affair with Pan Lianfa, a tailor living next door, for some time. She became pregnant and absconded in February, hiding in Lan Nidu, Pudong. After her father, Wu Xiaodi, found out, he retrieved her. Fearing that Pan Lianfa would abduct her again, Wu placed A Jin temporarily in the home of the matchmaker Tang Chuntao (who is also the uncle of her son-in-law, Zhu Tugen). On the 19th of this month, A Jin eloped again. Xiaodi asked people to investigate, but to no avail. The day before yesterday, he ran into Pan Lianfa and had him arrested and sent to the Sixth District Third Precinct. According to the interrogation by Director Liu, Pan Lianfa, 32 years old, said, "I work at a clothing store in Wu Jia Alley, Lao Beimen. A Jin came to me. She is temporarily staying in the Gen Tai electric light shop in Ti Lan Qiao." After the interrogation, Director Liu immediately sent the police to bring her back to the precinct. Yesterday afternoon, a document was prepared and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>The Woman in the Frame-Up Case is Known as "Old San the Bandit"</h3>
<p>There are Two People with that Name in the City</p>
<p>The People Nearby Fear Them Like Tigers</p>
<p>Mao Xiaomao, who runs a clothing store on Xun Dao Street in the city, had Shao Zhang, nicknamed "Old San the Bandit," and Han Yin, the wife of Han Jingxiang, come to his store to have clothes made the day before yesterday. Afterwards, Shao Zhang told Han Yin that there was a handgun in the scrap pile in the clothing store and asked her to report it to her husband, Han Jingxiang.

<h3>Lawsuit Concerning the Flower God Temple</h3>
<p>The Guild had Dismissed the Temple Manager</p>
<p>Temple Manager Sues the Court for Damages</p>
<p>There is a Flower God Temple south of Xieqiao, established by flower sellers as a shrine to the ancestor of the flower industry, and the origin is unknown. Every lunar April, offerings are made with exceptional reverence. For decades, the temple hired Lu Tuquan as its manager. Recently, the flower industry also organized a guild, and the guild headquarters was established in the temple. The guild, in the name of the industry association, dismissed Lu Tuquan and hired a caretaker for the temple in its place. Lu Tuquan was unwilling, so the guild asked the police to force his removal. Lu was unwilling to accept this and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the local court against Wang Yueyuan, the executive of the guild, seeking compensation of 800 yuan. His grounds were that the temple was originally barren land and only became the magnificent structure it is today due to the plaintiff's management and efforts. After exhausting his efforts, the finished product was forcibly seized, so if he is to be dismissed, he must be compensated for his previous losses. The defendant, Wang Yueyuan, also hired a lawyer to file a response. Yesterday afternoon, the judge opened the court and instructed that the case could not be decided and ordered an out-of-court settlement within one week. If a settlement cannot be reached, the defendant must submit the guild's charter to the court at the next hearing so that it can be reviewed and a decision made.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have read the news in your esteemed newspaper's local section (Court Opens Trial of Fraudulent Claim of May 30th Compensation), which states that Luo Wenlang (hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint with the Special District Court against Hu Changsheng, Chen Fucai, Wang Daohua, Li Changsheng, etc., who are responsible for handling the May 30th Incident Martyrs' Families Association). Upon investigation, the only people in charge of our association are the two representatives, Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai, and the secretary, Pan Qianchu, a total of three people. There are no such individuals as Wang Daohua and Li Changsheng. How could Luo Wenlang not know this and forcibly include Wang and Li as persons in charge of our association? This is clearly intentional and aimed at suing multiple associations. If he did not forcibly include Wang and Li as persons in charge of our association, then our association's complete compensation procedures would be impossible to accuse, let alone criminally accuse. The situation is already clear. However, this mistake may cause the outside world to misunderstand the truth. We urgently request your esteemed newspaper to publish this letter in the letter column to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Shanghai May 30th Incident Martyrs' Families Association. Republic of China, May 27, 19th year.</p>
<p>To the Editor: In the local news (General Assembly of the Industry and Commerce Management Association) sent by our company yesterday, the preparatory committee member Chen Yiting was a mistake for Chen Liting. Please correct it accordingly. Sincerely, Kwok Man News Agency. May 27.</p>

<h3>Reasons for China's Failure</h3>
<p>Japanese teams can cooperate</p>
<p>Have scientific training</p>
<p>Our country is selfish</p>
<p>This newspaper, Tokyo Telegram, 27th, attributes our country's failure to the unfavorable rulings of the referee, but it is undeniable that the Japanese have made rapid progress. Taking ball games as an example, the whole team cooperates based on scientific and diligent training, which is different from the selfish actions of individuals in our country. The loss in basketball is due to this point. We must learn from this lesson and correct our mistakes. The reporter, in addition to his sadness, warns the basketball and volleyball players of our country to be careful in handling things to win the final honor.</p>

<p>This newspaper, Tokyo Telegram, 27th, describes in detail how the Chinese football team defeated the Philippines by a score of 5 to 0.</p>
<p>On the 27th, our country's football team defeated the Philippines by a score of 5 to 0. The battle between the two sides began at 12:30 PM. People from all countries, because our team has a long-standing reputation in East Asia, came out of their homes to watch, no less than 36,000 people. Prince Chichibu, the president, returned to Beijing this morning and came to the arena with his wife at 1:20 PM to watch, paying special attention. At that time, the white clouds were light and the wind was blowing in the square, and the weather was very suitable. The Japanese Takenouchi served as the referee, and Asu and Hamada served as the side referees.</p>
<h3>(1) The Philippines initially showed its ferocity and attacked three times</h3>
<p>With the declaration of war, China advanced the ball, but the ball's momentum turned to the Philippine left. Inner player Zhige headed the ball over the post. The first good opportunity turned into smoke. In two minutes, the center</p>

<p>Huang Ruihua's pass was effective, and Cao Guicheng showed his skills. He shot, but it went wide. In the blink of an eye, the Philippines' five forwards surrounded our goal and attacked fiercely, but they missed again. In five and a half minutes, our army approached and formed a corner. The key moment was saved by the Philippines. The Philippines attacked three times deep into our territory. Our army defended skillfully and had no effect.</p>
<h3>(2) Three goals in a row, the Filipinos were frightened</h3>
<p>At this time, our army shouted and the entire army used its life. The left wing Ye Beihua went straight into the inner guard along the sideline. The top missed, and Dai Linjing tried a small trick. His foot went up and responded with a sound, and the goal was scored in just fourteen minutes. The entire arena shouted, and the Chinese cheerleading team was especially interested. The Philippines was ambitious and explored the door again. Zhou Xianyan handled it properly and turned the danger into safety. At that time, China fought better and better, and its footwork was skillful and agile. The audience's praise shook the world. At 27 minutes, China took advantage of a corner kick, and the heroes gathered at the enemy's door and snatched each other. Sun Jinshun received Cao Guicheng's pass, picked it up forward, and Dai Linjing welcomed it with his head and sent it into the net. It was very beautiful and spectacular. The Philippines lost two goals and was frightened. Around 30 minutes, Cao Guicheng had another wonderful pass. Dai came out with a thunderous and lightning-fast foot and shot the third goal. After entering the goal, Cao's ball position was too far away, and it was not easy to pass it to the left side. Ye then shot it into the goal, but the referee canceled it because Ye was offside. At 40 minutes, Philippine right inner Ogede suddenly attacked fiercely. Zhou lay down and saved the ball, winning applause from the entire stadium. In the morning, China won a complete victory of three to zero.</p>
<h3>(3) Continue to work hard and win two more goals</h3>
<p>The Filipinos lost three goals and were frightened. They immediately changed their generals to save the situation. However, China's strength was strong and it was still free. The general situation seemed to be one-sided. Four minutes later, China suddenly encountered a strange danger. Philippine Maitinra broke through the defense and entered alone. Zhou Xianyan rushed out to meet the enemy. The goal was empty. However, Mai was too hasty and shot wide. The misfortune of the Philippines was the great fortune of China. Later, Sun Jinshun kicked a free kick and sent it straight to the door, but the goalkeeper saved it. China saw that the other party's strength was limited and could not do much, so it changed its formation and continued to advance. As a result of continued efforts, Ye Beihua and Sun Jinshun each scored another goal, making it five to zero. From then on, the Philippine positions were all occupied by our army. Fortunately, their defense was strict and they did not see any more lost land. China's Li Tiansheng stood alone, and the enemy was afraid to see him. Chen Zhenhe and Huang Ruihua flew all over the field, and their results were excellent. Zhou Xianyan's save was also one of the reasons for our army's victory that day.</p>

In the first half, Japan led with 21 to 11.</p>
<p>Due to sudden rain in the afternoon, the slippery court was changed to the indoor court of Tokyo Municipal No. 1 Junior High School.

At that time, the ball was mostly in China's possession, but it was difficult to advance. Qiao first opened the scoring, and Lu Zhongen scored one point from a free throw. From then on, the Japanese momentum suddenly increased, and they led with 14 to 1. Liu Jianchang scored two consecutive goals, adding some color. In short, the Japanese four-man combined attack made it difficult for China to cope. Their shooting accuracy was better than ours. In the first half, Japan 21, China 11.</p>
<p>In the second half, Chen Shengkui and Wang Yuzeng entered the court, and the competition between the two sides became even more intense. Yao Enhan succeeded, and soon it became 15 to 23.

In the second group, Sun Guiyun false-started three times and lost her qualification. Sun later told people that she did not understand the starting signal at the time, and the audience could not help but regret, because it was initially believed that Sun's results would definitely get a position.

<h3>Interview with Indian Athletes at the Far Eastern Games (Qian Hua from Tokyo)</h3>
<p>Indian sports are developing rapidly</p>
<p>Football and tennis are the most recognized in the world</p>
<p>What left the deepest impression on us at the 9th Far Eastern Games was the participation of Indian athletes. The Far Eastern Games have been held eight times, and the participants have always been China, Japan, and the Philippines. This time, India made an exception to attend, and the Far Eastern nations' concept of sports will increase a lot of interest because of it. It is expected that the number of countries participating in the Far Eastern Games after the 10th will gradually increase.</p>
<p>Although the Indian delegation this time was only four people, their spirit was consistent. Judging from their achievements, they are all visible. The so-called "winning more with less" is the Indian delegation led by Mr. M Kers i. Mo is a graduate of Kolkata University in India and holds a master's degree from Harvard University in the United States. He is currently the sports minister of the Kolkata Youth Association and the honorary secretary of the Bengal Olympics Basketball Association. The remaining three are official athletes, with Mr. A Hamid as the captain. Ha is a graduate of Punjab University in India and is 24 years old. He is a first-class athlete in India and represented India at the World Games in Amsterdam in 1928. Although he did not win, he has gradually emerged in the world sports world. His recent results have been even more impressive. His record for the 120-yard hurdles is 15.8 seconds, keeping the Indian record. The second is the record of 10 seconds for 100 yards. This time, he participated in the hurdles, long jump, triple jump, and ten events at the conference. The second is Mr. M Autton, who is only 20 years old and graduated from a church middle school. He participated in the 100-meter, 200-meter, long jump, triple jump, and five other events. The third person is A Yusuf, who is 23 years old and a graduate of Kolkata University in India. His high jump score is 5 feet 11 inches, the holder of the Indian record. He participated in the high jump and hurdles at the conference. The Indian delegation initially stayed at the Tokyo Indian Club. After the Chinese and Philippine athletes arrived in Japan together, they moved to the Japanese Youth Hall in Meiji Jingu Gaien and lived with the Chinese, Japanese, and Philippine athletes. Chinese athletes lived on the first and second floors, the Philippines on the third floor, and Japan and India lived on the fourth floor. The reporter made a special visit on the 20th of the month and was received by Mr. Moxie. Moxie was physically strong and spoke English very fluently. The reporter asked about the current status of sports in India and various aspects of women's sports. The following is a brief record of his conversation:</p>
<h3>Indian sports</h3>
<p>Mr. Mo said that the sports industry in India today can be said to be in the autumn of vigorous development. Young men and women are very interested in various sports. Various groups include sports associations and various ball sports associations. The training of track and field competitions and ball sports in various secondary and higher schools is extremely serious, so in recent years, the Indian sports industry has made considerable progress. Indian athletes once participated in the World Games in Amos Deshun, and they are also very willing to join the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<h3>Recent situation of women's sports</h3>
<p>Women's sports in India have also developed particularly recently. The most popular sports in India are hockey and basketball. The conference originally intended to select representatives to participate in the performance competition, but because of the rush of time and the fact that volleyball is not a sport that Indian women are accustomed to, they could not attend the conference, which is a pity. I hope that there will definitely be a place for Indian women at the next conference.</p>
<h3>Indian tennis and football</h3>
<p>Indian youth are most interested in sports, namely football and tennis, so the results of the football team are highly praised by people all over the world. The football event of the Far Eastern Games has always been dominated by China. If India can join, it will definitely compete with China for a while. I really don't know who will win. This time, a football representative was scheduled to be sent, but because the Indian National Football War started in mid-May, it was impossible to come to Japan. There are many tennis experts in India, but unfortunately this time they are all going to Europe to participate in the Davis Cup competition and cannot come to show their skills.</p>
<h3>Will tour Tianjin</h3>
<p>Mr. Mo then said that after the closing of the conference, the International Sports Games will be held in Kansai on June 1 and 2. Indian athletes are very willing to participate. They will leave Japan around June 5. Because they still have to attend the welcome party of the local Indian overseas Chinese in Kobe. After leaving Japan, they will first go to Shanghai, then go north to Tianjin for a tour, and then return to Shanghai by boat. Mr. Mo was very talkative and spoke eloquently. He also said that many things in Shanghai are very cheap, and the cost of living is lower than in other countries. It is indeed a piece of paradise in the ancient world.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Maru Anecdotes (Cang)</h3>
<p>The Far Eastern Games were held in Japan this time and opened on the 24th at noon. All the people and related figures in our country arrived on time. Shanghai Maru was the last class before the opening. The anecdotes related to the conference (on board) are briefly described below:</p>
<p>The National Arts Hall has already set off The eight people on behalf of the National Arts Hall have already set off for Japan. However, its director Zhang Zhijiang took the Shanghai Maru. The reporter saw Mr. Zhang and said that the eight people are teachers, so they will not participate in the competition, but only watch the games.</p>
<p>Zhao Lin Throws Rings The wind was calm and the waves were calm from Shanghai to Nagasaki, just like a land trip. Economic Committee members of the Sports Promotion Association Lin Kanghou and Zhao Jinqing also went on the same boat and agreed to play ring toss on the deck. A total of seven people joined the battle group. Lin Zhao was very excited and his results were not behind. As a result, Zhao Jun's son set a new record with 26 points in one throw.</p>
<p>Lin's mistake At that time, the wind on the ship was quite strong. Lin Kanghou entered the cabin first, and six people continued to throw rings one after another. Suddenly a Japanese servant shouted loudly, "Is Mr. Lin here?" The group pointed to Lin Zecang and said, "Here." They talked for a long time, but Mr. Lin didn't know what to say until he found out that it was actually Lin Kanghou who caused this mistake.</p>
<p>I didn't see Xu Shuzhen The newspaper reported that Hua Jiwen would accompany his wife Xu Shuzhen on the Shanghai Maru to Japan and declared that it was purely a tour and had no political purpose. However, Liu and his wife did not take this boat to Japan. We were quite sorry that we didn't see Ms. Xu's foot decorations.</p>
<p>Xu Minhui joins Ping-Pong Xu Minhui, the head of the physical education department of Soochow University in Suzhou, also went with him. Since there were extra berths for the Chinese Ping-Pong team and they were all Chinese, he joined the team and lived together. They talked and laughed and didn't feel lonely.</p>
<p>The funds of the Sports Association This time, the Chinese Sports Association went to Japan, and the funds were originally short of more than 10,000 yuan. Except for the 6,000 to 7,000 yuan obtained after the football competition, there was still a lot lacking. In addition to being jointly responsible by the economic committee members Lin Kanghou and Zhao Jinqing, Mr. Qu Yongzhong also donated 2,000 yuan. It can be seen that Mr. Qu is enthusiastic about sports. He also went on the same boat.</p>
<p>The Pioneer of Guides When Chinese people go to Japan for travel or sightseeing, they often get the assistance and guidance of the Japanese Chinese Youth Association. This time, the cadre of the association, Mr. Ma Boyuan, also took the same boat with a special letter of introduction from the coach of the Chinese Ping-Pong team. Therefore, he made preliminary contacts on the ship and was fully supported along the way.</p>
<p>Distributed to the meeting Zhang Zhijiang and Zhao Lin and other gentlemen disembarked in Nagasaki and took the train to the opening ceremony of the conference. The Chinese Ping-Pong team disembarked in Kobe.</p>
<h3>Municipal Sports Field Small Volleyball West City Wins Meixi</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 pm was the date for the Municipal Sports Field Primary School Volleyball Competition Association Group B match between the Meixi and Xicheng teams. Although Meixi's ball skills were not yet proficient, they had definitely improved and were not below Xicheng. Unfortunately, they lacked composure in the battle and the connections between each stack were few, so Xicheng took advantage of it. As a result, Xicheng won Meixi with 21 to 15, 10 to 21, and 21 to 9, totaling 2 to 1. Referee Zhang Longhai</p>
<h3>Pudong wins Nanyang Small Football</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, Pudong Middle School and Nanyang Business College played in the Shanghai Secondary School Small Football Championship. As a result, Pudong Middle School won 2 to 0. Referee Jia Jun</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Open Tennis Championship</h3>
<p>A few days ago, Guo Qida and Ye Shenwen of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Hangzhou Section Sports Association attended the Hangzhou Open Tennis Competition and participated in the singles championship, which was won by Mr. Guo. The doubles championship was won by Mr. Guo and Mr. Ye.</p>

Then, the chief of the responsible department, Jiang Mingqi, reported, followed by reports from the principals of each school. Finally, Director Chen summarized and answered the questions raised by each school. Among them, the most important issues were that after the new standards of each school, it was felt that the time for Chinese and arithmetic was too short, and there was too much work and physical education.

<p>Servant: He has gone out.</p>
<p>Guest: But how is it that the hat he always wears is still on the hat rack?</p>
<p>Servant: That's not a problem. But look, my robe is hanging in the back garden, yet how am I here at the front door?</p>
<p>A: I have already lost two wives, and now I am preparing to marry a third.</p>
<p>B: You are too careless. How could you lose two wives? Now that you are marrying a third, you must keep her safely in a bank vault and not lose her again.</p>
<p>Wife A: My husband is an excellent swimmer. He can not only swim long distances but also stay underwater for two minutes.</p>
<p>Wife B: That's not so amazing. My husband swam underwater three years ago and hasn't come up yet.</p>
<p>Judge: You are extremely barbaric! Newlyweds should be very loving and affectionate. How dare you injure your new wife? I must send you to prison for a month.</p>
<p>Criminal: Your Honor, that's not the main problem. It's just that my honeymoon won't happen.</p>
<h3>A Brief Account of Dr. Ma Guile's Lecture by Huang Jiping</h3>
<p>Dr. Ma Guile (字 Xuanbo, a literary scholar of France, proficient in ancient and modern languages, studying Chinese literature for more than ten years, with profound achievements. Dr. Ma had long cherished the ambition to visit China. This time, he came to China under the order of the French government to investigate higher education. As soon as he arrived in Shanghai, academic institutions from various places eagerly invited him to lecture. There have been many foreigners who have come to China to lecture, but few can thoroughly research our country's scholarship and speak pure Chinese. It is probably because the Chinese people admire his academic spirit and want to see a glimpse of his demeanor. Dr. Ma recently returned to Shanghai from Kyoto. Various universities and academic groups in Shanghai have scheduled a rotation of lectures. At 3:00 PM on the 25th, the Oriental Cultural Society held a lecture in the auditorium of the French Public Works Bureau on Huanlong Road, inviting him to lecture. The reporter and a friend went to listen to his great speech. On time, people from all walks of life came in droves, with no fewer than three hundred people. Some even brought their lovers, and the mix of men and women added much color to the occasion. After waiting for a long time, there was no movement. A gentleman stood up and announced that Dr. Ma was attending a public banquet for the press this afternoon and would arrive later, so please wait patiently. He arrived at 3:15 PM. Ding Zhaoqing, Li Weihou, Zhu Shaoping, and others also arrived. Dr. Ma's demeanor was solemn, and his bearing was dignified. At a glance, one could tell that he was a learned and cultivated scholar. After shaking hands and exchanging greetings with Mr. and Mrs. Cai Yuanpei, Mr. Li gave a speech introducing the doctor, who then took his seat and sat upright, taking out his manuscript from his sleeve, titled (The Changes and Characteristics of Asian Culture). The original text was lengthy, divided into four sections: (1) The Developed Centers of Ancient Asian Culture; (2) The Characteristics of the Progress of Asian Culture; (3) The Communication between Chinese and Western Cultures; (4) Conclusion. The whole article elaborated in great detail. He stated that the development of world culture was centered in six places: China, India, Egypt, Babylon, Mesopotamia, and Central America, among which Chinese culture was the most beautiful and complete. It has been preserved unchanged for five thousand years, surpassing other countries that have undergone several changes. The conclusion stated that world culture originated in Asia, and European culture was also based on Asia, but</p>
<h3>Ye Chucang's Remembrance of Bi Yihong, Heard on the Street</h3>
<p>It has been five years since the passing of the late lyricist Mr. Bi Yihong. At the time of his death, he left behind eight children, some of whom were still infants. Friends organized an educational fund for the orphans, with Zhang Xueliang donating one thousand yuan as an initiative. His wife, Ms. Miao Shizhen, graduated from Renhe Obstetrics Hospital and was able to support herself. She wanted to open a hospital, but the equipment and other expenses were too high to raise funds. The eldest and second sons, Qingcang and Qingtong, are expected to graduate from Minli High School in the summer of the twentieth year. However, the remaining funds of the orphans' fund were lost due to the collapse of the China Huili Bank. For nearly a year, they have been scrambling for tuition fees. Mr. Huang Chu Jiu, Zang Boyong, and others have been enthusiastic supporters and have maintained their friendship to the end. Mr. Ye Chucang had a close friendship with Yihong in his lifetime, sharing poetry and wine. Hearing this, he felt deeply saddened and donated one thousand yuan from his meager salary to Qian Xumi to pass on half for the Bi sons' school fees and half for Mrs. Bi's equipment expenses. Nowadays, people's hearts are no longer as they used to be, and the way of friendship has declined. Mr. Ye's remembrance of an old friend can be said to be a standout among ordinary people, a true and upright person. (In return) In terms of the process of development, Europe is faster. Modern European material civilization has benefited from Asian culture. His words were not an exaggeration. The lecture lasted for an hour and a half, delivered entirely in Mandarin with a loud voice, although the tone was slightly slow and the pronunciation was quite accurate, even surpassing those from Fujian and Guangdong who speak Mandarin. The reporter asked to read his original manuscript, which was thousands of words long, written in his own hand, with neat handwriting, which was also said to be difficult. Finally, the host invited the guests to take a group photo on the lawn before dismissing the gathering.</p>
<h3>An Account of the Yu-Zhang Wedding by Wuwai Anzhu</h3>
<p>On May 23rd, my old friend Yu Kongwo and Ms. Zhang Jingzi from the same town held their wedding ceremony at Yipinxiang Restaurant. I had just returned to Shanghai from Putuo and had barely taken off my travel gear when I received the invitation. I rushed to offer my congratulations. The wedding hall was ornately decorated, and the air was filled with the fragrance of flowers. When I entered the venue, it was already past 3:00 PM. After sitting for a short while, the ceremony began. Mr. Xu Jingren officiated, and Mr. Yan Duhe was the master of ceremonies. When the newlyweds bowed to each other three times, someone shouted, "What is the usher doing? Why isn't he bowing?" He then followed the order and bowed, causing the guests to applaud and laugh incessantly, which was quite amusing.</p>
<p>Mr. Jingren has long been known as a talented person, and his witty remarks are admired by all who hear them. On this day, in his speech, he said that the weather had changed from rain to shine, proving the fruition of a perfect marriage. He also used the analogy of division of labor and cooperation to describe Kongwo's early departures and late returns, the result of which will be revealed in the newspapers sometime next year, on a certain day in a certain month, a son will be born. Everyone applauded loudly. However, from my perspective, a reporter's life often involves late departures and early returns, and cooperation and division of labor are therefore reversed. Old Jing has never been a reporter himself, so his words only reached this point.</p>
<p>Among the guests, Mr. Sun Yusheng and Mr. Yan Duhe were invited to deliver congratulatory speeches. Mr. Sun fully elaborated on the name "Kongwo," saying that since "Kong" (empty) is no longer empty, "Wo" (I) now has two "I"s. He also said that Kongwo once used the four characters "Yishangren" (an eminent monk) as a pseudonym, so wouldn't today's auspicious ceremony become an interesting event of a monk marrying a wife? The audience burst into laughter. Mr. Yan's speech began with a self-declaration that he was singing his own praises, as he was delivering a congratulatory speech as the master of ceremonies. His witty remarks were endless. The most insightful of his words was that since "Shangren" (an eminent monk) is now actually performing the work of "Shangren," what he should pay attention to is saving time and staying cheerful. Mr. Yan possessed what the world calls the eloquence and wit to charm the world.</p>
<p>Finally, Kongwo delivered a speech of thanks. After sitting for a short while, I had another appointment and bid farewell to Kongwo without being able to attend the grand banquet. Therefore, I recorded two short poems and published them in the "Free Talk" column for the public. The congratulatory speeches from the guests on this day were quite consistent with the themes of the poems. However, these poems were presented too late to be displayed in the hall, proving that our views were the same and coincided without prior consultation. (Laughing at my involvement in the world of form and emptiness (It is said that Kongwo has recently been learning Tantric Buddhism from the monk Dayu)) New makeup vies with the red of pomegranates, In this reversal, the shadows of mandarin ducks are all in deep, unspoken affection. (Kongwo printed a double image on the invitation, with the woman on the right and the man on the left, and titled it "Recent Photos of Jingzi and Kongwo," etc. Although this imitates Western customs, it also shows the sincerity of their feelings.) There is a widespread reputation on the sea for her divine needlework, Her wonderful brush embellishes her writing anew. (The newspapers in Shanghai reported the day before that the lady was proficient in Chinese studies and had a reputation for her divine needlework.) I fear that it will be difficult to distinguish between male and female, Her husband is originally a talented scholar. (Kongwo likes to play the role of Su San in operas, which captivates the audience, hence the teasing.)</p>
<h3>A Variety of Tea Party by Xu Xinqin</h3>
<p>On the 24th of this month, the Shanghai art community held a tea party on the eighth floor of the Hua'an Building to bid farewell to Mr. Wang Jiyuan, also known as Damuzi, on his trip to Europe. The view from above was pleasant, and the anecdotes from the party were endless, making it a night to remember.</p>
<p>Photography preceded the three-hour tea party. Due to the dim light, the photography was slow. The chairman, Xiao Jian, said to Fo Qing and Boxiang, "You two are experts, why don't you go and help?" Another person said, "If Boxiang takes the photo, there will be three lenses, including his glasses. Which one should people focus on?" The entire room burst into laughter.</p>
<p>An old man sat in the middle of the crowd. Some people had beards but were not old (Shanzi and Xiaojian), while others were old but did not have beards (Mr. Wang Yiting). Only Huang Binhong had both a beard and was old. Therefore, the chairman, who had a beard but was not old, first invited Mr. Huang, who had both a beard and was old, to speak, and thunderous applause followed.</p>
<p>Two small gentlemen, known for their outspokenness, repeatedly stated that Damuzi was a rare and valuable simpleton and urged everyone to learn from Damuzi's simplicity. They also said that they were not as good as him because they did not know how to be simple. The audience was moved.</p>
<p>Damuzi volunteered to carry the shoulder pole. Everyone said they hoped to carry some Chinese goods abroad to sell and then carry some foreign goods back to China to sell. However, Damuzi was not afraid of carrying the shoulder pole and expressed his willingness to do so.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's career is thriving. Damuzi replied that after he left, everyone should look at Mr. Wang in Shanghai Comics to know his news. It is expected that Mr. Zhang Guangyu and Mr. Ye Qianyu will ensure that Mr. Wang's career thrives.</p>
<h3>Returning from Venice by Zhou Shixun</h3>
<p>The Drama Society, which I had not seen for a long time, surprisingly reunited at the Central Auditorium. This was such a joy. From the antique Venetian streets on the stage, I saw a new interest.</p>
<p>According to historical records, Shakespeare wrote many famous works, but (The Merchant of Venice), although not his representative work from his middle age, can certainly be considered one of his famous works based on its description and all criticisms.</p>
<p>I admire Shakespeare's writing. He can use all his strength to highlight every object and event in any script. For example, in this play, the Jew is simply portrayed and satirized without leaving any room. It seems that the arguments in the courtroom and the mockery in the streets of Venice would have caused the Jew to commit suicide if he had any sense of shame.</p>
<p>Although this performance by the Drama Society did not reach perfection, it is clear from what I heard that the efforts of Ying Yunwei and the training of the actors were not without merit. In an era of silent art, it is enough to give us comfort.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Hengzhuang, who went with us that day, said to me that he had some doubts before entering the auditorium, but after entering, he felt that the doubts had completely disappeared. When he returned home, he felt an endless aftertaste. This was all due to the impression the Jew in (The Merchant of Venice) gave us.</p>
<h3>A Fifteen-Pound Giant Bird by Dai Bingzhong</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 20th, a hunter from Qibao Town in the western suburbs of this city brought in a giant bird weighing fifteen pounds. It resembled a goose, with gray feathers, a white beak, and broad and flat feet measuring about a foot long. Its feet were brown and webbed. Its neck and feet were not very long, suggesting that it was an amphibian. The bird was initially purchased by the owner of a tea house for two yuan, but many of its feathers were plucked by onlookers. In the evening, the assistant priest of the Catholic Church in the town learned of this and purchased it for four yuan. It was said that if the feathers were intact, it would be worth more than ten yuan. It is said that if the feathers were complete, they would be worth more than ten yuan. The bird has now been taken to Xujiahui by the assistant priest. It is not known what purpose it will serve.</p>
<h3>European Travel Notes (56)</h3>
<p>Matisse's Sixtieth Birthday (C)</p>
<p>Between 1906 and 1913, Matisse achieved the highest position in the history of art and had a huge influence on modern painters. According to critic Andre Levinson, the thirty or forty paintings by Matisse collected by Schtchoukine and Morosoff in the Moscow Museum have created a real Matisse Museum. (Dancing and Music) or (The Red Room) are certainly important, and the delicate oriental fabrics (Levantine sketches) should also be especially valued. The latter is a work from 1929 and now decorates the walls of Camille Manclir. These works already have excellent reproductions popular in Paris. Mr. Anterle's remarks are correct. His lines have a unique talent, so his sketches are purely creative structures and express his most complete excellence.</p>
<p>What is the fact that Matisse lived a beautiful and fearless life for forty years, respected and admired by his contemporaries? It is that he applied the principles of decorative painting to oil painting. He went beyond the Byzantine icons and Persian delicate paintings and painted everything on the same plane of the canvas with decoration and rhythm. Like Paul Gauguin, he seemed to be stimulated by the scenery of the South Seas and felt a great interest in murals. He wanted to use the harmony of colors to create pure paintings in total, and unintentionally leaned towards the decorative side. For example, the (Odalisque) Cdalisgue exhibited at this meeting, with the still life placed in front and the extremely simple background, together formed a plane line composition, dividing the parallel quadrilaterals with the decorative effect of color. The main (Odalisque) lies in front of the blue and green background, just like looking at a European oriental carpet with gorgeous texture and bright colors. The fanatically shaking picture is still full of quiet and pure spirit. The same is true for another (Figure). The green walls and fire-red carpet set off the naked figures, creating and structuring each other with two strong and solid tones. Only a few diagonal lines point to the depth, which can be said to be like a Frise. Matisse is not an ordinary craftsman, although he often expresses the taste of handicrafts. He returns objects to colors. The several paintings mentioned above have also been concentrated, balanced, and accumulated in (simplicity). He is seeking a way out for modern art with an indomitable spirit.</p>

<p>Business News and Finance: Sudden Tightening of Credit</p>
<p>Rumored Cause of a Certain Bank Failure</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market suddenly reported a tightening of credit, and bill discounting was suddenly suspended again. Even the exchange of funds was scarce, and the situation was very alarming. As for the reason, it was rumored that a certain bank announced its failure to honor checks last night, and many in the industry were in arrears, so everyone was tight and a tense situation developed. It was found that the early market exchange rate opened at 2.5%, which was 1% higher than the morning before. The midday silver discount price was the same as the head price plus water, and because the bank also had special collection doubts, it remained strong, at 1.56%. The bank's listed price was 1%, and the market price in the early market was 7%, 1%, 9 li, and 2.5 hao. The midday market was 7%, 1%, and 9 li. The early market exchange of bills was 1.88 million, and the midday market was 1.065 million. The early market for banknotes was 72,000, and the midday market was 15,000. The early market for banknotes outside the exchange was 140,000, and the midday market was 75,000. Bank transactions and various collections were not yet investigated.

<h3>Gold Market Changes Violently</h3>
<p>Rumors of Tax on Silver Imports Abound</p>
<p>Fluctuations of More Than Ten Taels Throughout the Day</p>
<p>Falling Six Taels and Six Qian Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>Exchange Rate and Gold Prices Diverge. Yesterday, the gold market experienced violent fluctuations, rising and falling erratically. The overall market fluctuated by more than ten taels, making it difficult to grasp. The exchange rate trend was strong, with new low prices repeatedly appearing, and the price shrank again. Speculators were buying and selling. The bank settled a lot of money, but it was inversely proportional to the gold price, so it did not rely on it. Although the buying and selling among colleagues was lively, it was meaningless to enter and exit quickly. The early market saw a shrinkage of large bars, and the exchange rate also shrank repeatedly, so it rose to a peak of 529 taels. Afterwards, a storm broke out, and sellers tried to clear their positions. The silver discount still saw an increase, and it was rumored that silver would be taxed on imports, so the atmosphere suddenly deteriorated, and there was a tendency to decline rapidly, falling to 56 taels. The exchange rate followed suit. Later, Wanxing, Zhifeng, Yongfu, Chang, and others bravely sold. The initial opening was low, and then it once improved because the buyer seemed sensitive. After the large households sold off, people's hearts were weak, and it fell sharply by 56 taels, breaking the 520 tael mark. The early morning opened higher, but then showed fatigue. Because the British bank was as low as 375, the silver price shrank by 87%, and the seven-month gold price opened at 3 qian, at 526 taels. The gross price reached 28 taels and 7 qian. Because the first order was pre-read, it shrank again. The first order revealed that the discount was 125 US dollars, and the 25th gold was 75, at 28 taels and 12 qian, plus 8 taels and 6 qian. The internal settlement was suppressed by a small amount, to 9:30. Suddenly, it shrank again by half a gear, calculated as 125 US dollars, 2 jiao, 5 ri gold plus 625, and the internal market was also expensive. Shanghai's September British gold was bought at 9 pence to 8 pence 875. The East once absorbed 875. The June ri gold had to settle at 1 tael, 1 qian, 7 fen, 5, so it rose to 29 taels. Suddenly, the downstream dropped by 12 taels. After 10:30, it was even more tired. In fact, large households were selling, and there were rumors of silver tax collection. However, people generally did not ask the details, and things got worse and worse, falling sharply by 5 taels. Then the 9th month British gold was buying 9 pence, and Wah Bi Mai Hang absorbed the August one at 125. Therefore, the midday closing was only counted as 23 taels and 5 qian.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, it suddenly broke the 20 tael mark. The market opened at 20 taels and 05 qian, followed by 19 taels and 5 qian. Suddenly, it jumped up 34 taels. Xiang Yu and others rushed to buy, so it was 23 taels and 78 qian. After a while, it dropped to 22 taels and 2 qian, and then added to 23 taels and 9 qian. The June ri gold was released by Mitsui at 1 tael, 1 qian, 6 fen, 75, and HSBC and Wah Yee traded against each other. The August first order was 9 pence 0625. However, after 3 o'clock, the wind suddenly turned weak. Fuchang, Xiangyu, and hedging traders successively released their positions, and people's hearts were extremely weak. It fell sharply, dropping by 5 taels. At 4 o'clock, it broke the 20 tael mark again. The exchange rate seemed to be declining. August banks were doing each other at 9 pence 1875. Then, it finally fell to 18 taels and 3 qian. After entering, it returned to 1 tael. At 4:30, the closing was 519 taels and 1 qian, which was 6 taels and 6 qian lower compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The revealed price was actually pressed to 478 taels. The largest price in one day was 29 taels, and the smallest price was 18 taels and 3 qian, a difference of 10 taels and 7 qian, making it unpredictable. The initial revealed price was 564 taels and 6 qian, calculated as a suppression of 37 taels. Later, it was changed to 567 taels and 6 qian, actually 434 taels to 78 taels. The early opening of goods was 26 taels and a half, the midday closing was 21 taels and a half, the afternoon was 20 taels and 7 qian, and the closing price was 20 taels and 05 qian.</p>
<p>Dalian gangs issued strips to hedge exchange rates. The total transactions of each number were: Yuan Mao Yong, Wanxing Shunli, Yu Da Zhifeng Yong, Tai Xing Fuchang Yuan Heng, all sold out. Yuan Xing Yong Bing Xing Heng Chang Yong Da Kang then entered Xiang Yu Da De Cheng Yuan Tai Heng Xing Fu Yu with different amounts of entry and exit. In the afternoon, Xiang Cheng Yuan Heng Yu Da all sold out. Yuan Xing Yong Yuan Mao Da Kang and retail investors all entered. Hedging traders sold out. Dalian gangs sold out about 56,000 strips to hedge exchange rates, and also bought in more than 1,500 strips, suffering heavy losses. People were very confused, and the market atmosphere was unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates Repeatedly Show New Low Prices</h3>
<p>British Exchange at One Shilling and Eight Pence Seventy-Five</p>
<p>US Exchange at Forty-Two Yuan</p>
<p>Japanese Exchange at One Taels, One Qian, Seven Fen, Six Two Five</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and other silver markets all trended to low peaks, breaking new records. Yokohama and Kobe remained deserted. HSBC's listed exchange rates repeatedly shrank. Yesterday, there were two reductions, calculated as a gear. British gold was 25, US dollars were half a yuan, and Japanese exchange added 1 fen 375, probably due to settlement. Since 9:30, British gold has shrunk by 125, US dollars by 2 jiao, and India by half a yuan. Japan has reduced by 75, calculated as 104 shields 25. France has reduced by 7 yuan, calculated as 1,071 francs. The slope exchange has added 75, calculated as 134 taels. The day gold plus 625 is listed as one taels, one qian, seven fen, six two five. Hong Kong is still 82 taels. The German exchange has slightly reduced by 1 yuan, calculated as 176 marks. As for the internal bank, it was flat at first, then tight, and settled in the afternoon. Compared with the previous day, the British and American markets were flat, and the day gold added half a fen, but the gold market went from sharp to weak and has broken into 520 taels. In fact, it is inversely proportional to the exchange rate, so the revealed price was suppressed by more than 40 taels. It is rare. Chinese merchants' entries and exits were inconsistent, but they entered in the morning and exited in the afternoon. It is estimated that British gold has about 200,000 pounds entering and exiting banks. Mitsui, Shanghai, Holland, and others are all selling. HSBC McCord, Zhengjin, and Huabi have all absorbed them. Various banks have done tens of thousands of pounds to each other, and also traded more than 100,000 US dollars. Chinese merchants bought and settled more than 200,000 yuan. Shanghai Xingye has sold a lot. As for the day gold, it has been bought by more than 1 million yuan. Taiwan Mitsui Mitsubishi and others have all sold, but a few have sold to Chinese banks. Dalian gangs have issued strips, so there are purchases and settlements, but they have suffered heavy losses. People are very confused, and the market atmosphere is unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Silver Prices Fall Repeatedly, US Silver Price Enters Customs at Four Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegraphic communications, the silver drop was even more intense, with the recent shrinkage of 375 to 18 pence and 25 (British gold is 1 shilling, 9 pence and 5625). The forward term also shrank by 375 to 18 pence and 1875. The general public sold out, and the market was unstable. According to New York telegraphic communications, the US silver price fell sharply by 875. It was even more strange that it had retreated to the customs gate of 4 jiao, which was 3 jiao, 9 fen and 25. The British dollar against the US dollar fell by 0625 to 4 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen and 875. The US dollar against the British dollar was still calculated at 4 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen and 9375. The Japanese dollar against the US dollar was still 49 yuan 4375. The British dollar against the Shanghai dollar was shortened by 625 to 1 shilling, 9 pence and 375. The spot price in Mumbai shrank by 14 ounces to 51 rupees and 12 ounces.</p>

<h3>Bond Market Approaching Delivery Period</h3>
<p>Disbandment and Troop Reduction Prices Fall Greatly</p>
<p>Transactions Reaching 9.7 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, securities trading was approaching the delivery period. Trading of May futures was stopped, and the settlement was handled first. It has been settled for more than 10 million yuan. July futures will be opened today, so yesterday there was only one type of trading for the June term. However, the price of the bond fluctuated greatly, and the market was still booming. Buying and selling were more active than before. The disbandment and troop reduction transactions were the largest, and the customs tax and troop reduction were also very active. As for the trend of various bond prices, when the market opened in the early morning, people in the market were uneasy, and sellers sold out one after another, so the price fell sharply. Although it once recovered, the result was still weak. It is estimated that the total futures trading volume for the day reached 9.7 million yuan, and spot goods also had 57,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Bond category, period, current, previous opening, later closing, compared to the previous day's trading volume</p>
<p>Whole six spot goods 72.00 72.20 Fell 1.00 25,000 Whole six June 69.10 68.80 Fell 1.60 750,000 Seven-year spot goods 84.00 Fell 1.00 3,000 Seven-year June 81.40 Fell 1.20 50,000 Continued small spot goods 80.60 Rose 0.60 7,000 Continued large June 79.40 79.10 Fell 0.95 35,000 After the war, June 92.20 91.75 Fell 1.00 475,000 Continued rolled June 65.40 65.85 Fell 0.65 265,000 Customs tax spot goods 69.50 Rose 2.00 1,000 Customs tax June 66.20 65.85 Fell 1.95 2,805,000 Disbanded spot goods 62.60 61.80 Fell 1.070 16,200 Disbanded small spot goods 60.80 Fell 0.60 Disbanded June 59.00 59.50 Fell 2.65 3,545,000 Troop reduction June 71.50 70.55 Fell 2.45 1,635,000 Financial spot goods 24.50 Rose 0.50 5,000 96 June 16.00 15.95 Fell 0.40 145,000</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flower Yarn Market Reappears Soft</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned sluggish, and the situation is quite soft. Rumors have suddenly arisen that several money houses are unstable. As a result, people's hearts are shaken, and selling pressure intensifies. Yarn sales are now relatively weak. The overall situation is still soft. Any adverse news can easily cause the market to fall. However, manufacturers' attitudes are relatively firm. After this batch of business is completed, and inventories are eased, Hengda manufacturers have decided to take in 4,000 bales of yarn, which will prevent the market from falling sharply for the time being.</p>
<p>Retailers sold standard yarn. Exchange members bid. The opening situation in the pre-market was flat. As American cotton softened, retailers sold slightly, with each declining by one or two qian. In the second and third sessions, rumors abounded, and the market fell further, each declining by two, five, seven, or eight qian to one or two liang. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot sales were bleak and morale was low, and it fell another one, two, or three qian. The total turnover for the day was estimated at 14,550 bales. The closing prices of the standard bids are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Standard Bid Closing Prices (Increase/Decrease, Open Account Balance):</p>
<p>August: 15.42, down 1.0, 24,400</p>
<p>May: 15.35, down 0.3, 17,150</p>
<p>September: 15.49, down 1.0, 11,575</p>
<p>June: 15.34, down 1.0, 30,600</p>
<p>October: 15.52, up 0.8, 10,700</p>
<p>July: 15.35, down 1.2, 24,600</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still being cleared. The total number of bales purchased by various groups throughout the day for Hangzhou was 810. Among the peers, 75 bales were purchased. The price fell by two and a half qian. The most purchases by customer groups were from the Guang group, totaling 360 bales. In addition, 160 bales were purchased for Shantou, 45 bales for Zhenjiang, 35 bales for Shantou, 60 bales for Tianjin, 50 bales for Sichuan, 15 bales for Qinhuangdao, 22 bales for Changsha, 15 bales for Qingdao, 25 bales for Wuhu, and 60 bales for miscellaneous groups.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Turns Dull Again</h3>
<p>American cotton is sluggish, and spot sales are inactive. However, the Han group's attitude remains firm. The cotton market softened due to the weakening of American cotton. However, the Han group's attitude is resilient because the bottom stocks from various routes are exhausted, and the Han market price is high. Therefore, the desire to go long is very strong, and they are unwilling to loosen their grip for the time being, so the surface is relatively tight. Manufacturers' actual sales still show no signs of development. However, standard cotton is difficult to fall.</p>
<p>Han standard is firmer this month. The opening of the Han standard in the exchange pre-market was flat, following the decline of foreign cotton by five fen to one qian. However, morale has not loosened, and bulls are optimistic. As this month is the last day, the Han group is determined to receive goods, and the market sentiment is more stable. Retailers covered their short positions, and the market rebounded by three qian. Distant months remained unchanged. The total turnover for the day was estimated at 45,200 dan. The closing prices of Han standard are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Han Standard Closing Prices (Increase/Decrease, Open Account Balance):</p>
<p>July: 55.0, down 1.0, 64,400</p>
<p>May: 34.95, up 0.5, 41,100</p>
<p>August: 35.8, up 0.0, 55,700</p>
<p>June: 35.4, down 1.0, 68,900</p>
<p>October: 35.15, up 0.5, 52,100</p>
<p>There were no spot cotton transactions. The source of supply at the dock was 75 bales of Tongzhou cotton.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton and Yarn Prices Mixed</h3>
<p>American cotton is dull and lifeless. Yesterday, American cotton traders watched the market, which was dull. Futures fell by one to five pound notes, and spot prices fell by ten pound notes. British cotton futures fell by six or seven points, and spot prices fell by fourteen points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by five points. Indian cotton weakened due to sales by speculators. It is reported that in the futures market, the "hao jia" (leading firms) have not officially decided not to trade with European merchants. Pingguo'er and Aomula fell by four rupees, and Bairuoxi fell by five rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 26th).</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market: Scarce Goods and Rising Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the number of rice boats arriving in Zhabei from various groups was extremely small, and the stock in the river areas was also exhausted, leading to firmer sentiment. Most merchants are watching the market. Sales of white japonica rice from the Northern group are still weak, but because of the scarcity of goods, prices have actually risen by about two jiao. Second-grade rice has also become tighter. The arrival of thin rice is not strong, so buying interest is gradually improving, and prices are rising by half a jiao. Lamb-tipped rice seems to be out of stock, and transactions are rare. The market is extremely dull. Bianyuan rice continues to arrive, but sales are stagnant, and the market is inching up, opening from 18 yuan and 3-4 jiao to 17 yuan and a half.</p>
<p>About ten boats arrived in the South Shanghai river area. Sales in this street are slow to improve. Changshu and Wuxi North japonica rice turned from weak to stable. Suzhou and Tongji japonica rice are still being sold in small lots, and transactions have not been able to expand. Prices are stable. It is observed that the price of japonica rice here is unlikely to return to smaller amounts. Thin early rice from the Southern group is evenly matched in terms of arrivals and sales, and the situation is slightly more active. High-quality goods are opening at 18 yuan and 5-6 jiao. Lamb-tipped goods are scarce and there are no standards. White yuan store sales are quite active, but selection is very strict, and market prices are trending firmer. Yin Hua buying interest is also strong, and the market is opening at around 17 yuan and 3 jiao, slightly up half a jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales Active and Prices Up Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw active handling by the Jiangbei group and the Jiangxi group, and morale was very good. This street also followed suit, and market prices immediately rose by a jiao. Over 10,000 bags were transacted. Small grain accounted for 8,000 bags, priced at 14 yuan, 7 jiao, 4-5 fen. No. 1 Saigon rice was 1,000 bags, priced at 15 yuan, 5 jiao, 5-6 fen. Large grain was 500 bags, priced at 14 yuan and 5 jiao. The price of Su Di Geng rice was 1,000 bags, priced at 15 yuan and 1 jiao. Medium-quality goods were reduced accordingly. The future outlook is still positive.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Rebounds Firmly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw an upward trend in the morning and afternoon sessions. The current month still has outside short sellers to settle at the end of the month, and the factory side is generally unwilling to circulate the spot goods as much as possible. This situation, in fact, the idea of squeezing the shorts is still unremitting. As for the far-term months, as far as the weather is concerned, the new wheat harvest will definitely have good results. However, the difference between June and May seems too large. Once the current month is over, it will be June, and the standard difference is up to two qian. The factory's attitude will still be hard and resistant. With this situation, morale is being boosted. It is observed that the far-term market will again be in a tumultuous period. As a result, the current month rose one fen compared to the previous day, June rose one fen and two and a half li, July rose one fen and a half, August rose one fen and two and a half li, and September and October each rose five li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Rise, Spot Goods Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a slight upward trend in the morning and afternoon sessions. Foreign wheat quotations recovered well, rising by six, seven, or nine jiao, causing excitement among outsiders. However, the weather was very good, with bright light shining on the future of the new wheat, so the market stabilized and was unable to surge. If the flour futures rise again, the wheat futures may have to be lifted. However, raising the wheat market is ultimately unfavorable to the factory side. As a result, June and July each rose one fen compared to the previous day, and September rose two fen. The spot wheat market remained stable with no significant ups or downs. Kaisha City wheat was 4 liang and 5 qian and 3 fen, Qingjiangpu wheat, Nansuizhou wheat, and Bengbu wheat were 5 liang and 1 qian and a half, totaling more than 1,300 bags, which were handled by Fufeng and Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Standard Soybean Oil Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot soybean oil reached 21 yuan, so the recent bulls in this port are watching and selling, and there are reports of receiving goods upon expiration. The reason is that the oil stocks in Shanghai are not strong. However, sales in Shanghai recently have been sluggish, so the shorts are not panicking on the surface, but the intention to cover is eager, so the market price rose by one qian, opening at 16 liang and 1 qian.</p>
<p>Soybean futures also saw an increase. The delivery of the current month is approaching, and Lianfang's quotations are frequently good, so the source of supply is increasingly reduced. The reason is that the market prices in Lianyungang and Shanghai are not cost-effective. The market was dull in the morning, but in the afternoon, the sellers' appetite improved due to the upward trend of Lian's telegram and the active spot sales. Buyers also purchased, so the selling pressure turned quiet and the price rose by three or four fen, opening at 5 liang, 4 qian, and 9 fen for the May contract. At the time of delivery of this term, it is inevitable that further price increases will be required.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Xiaolüqing Opens Firmly</h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Turns Hesitant</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market news from the producing areas: The current price of Cuban raw sugar is still 1.375. New York sugar futures: September 1.53, December 1.62, each down one point compared to the previous telegram. The price for March next year is 1.72, with no change. The current price of Javanese raw sugar is 9.625. June sugar futures are 9.50, also lacking increases or decreases. July is 9.375, down 0.125 compared to the previous one. In the association's market, Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white was scarce due to the sharp reduction in the Dutch exchange rate. The market sentiment suddenly became firm, and the price rose to 7 liang and 05 fen, still with supply failing to meet demand. However, the momentum was not strong, and most people remained on the sidelines, resulting in a hesitant situation with no transactions. Sellers were reluctant to sell because the Dutch exchange rate was even higher, and the cost of planning was even higher. Buyers were also indifferent due to the sluggish sales at this time. No. 20 medium sand white was transacted at 6 liang and 9 qian and a half, also in small amounts. The market image was quite firm. Japanese sugar N mark was 7 liang, 5 qian, 6 fen, 2.5 li. YT mark was 7 liang and 5 qian. YP mark was 7 liang and 7 qian. J mark was 8 liang, 2 qian, 2.5 fen. Transactions were also declining, and the market shape was flat and unremarkable. Only the Rixing Hao in the No. plate opened with 1,205 bags of Gaosan Xiaolüqing at 6 liang, 2 qian, and a half yuan. The demand was quite strong, and it was soon announced that it was sold through. The market image was still noticeable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Factory Silk Sales to America Continue Smoothly</h3>
<p>Recently, new dried cocoons from Zhejiang have been successively transported to Shanghai. Various factories are starting to reel new silk, and merchants are eager to sell new silk. Since the American and American firms received a telegram of rising silk prices in New York, the demand for new silk has continued smoothly. Yesterday, Qianli and others entered 150 bales of new factory silk from the sixth, seventh, and eighth months. The prices were firm.</p>
<h3>Wuxi New Cocoons Arrive Sparsely, Prices Flat</h3>
<p>Due to continuous overcast and rainy weather, the arrival of cocoons is increasingly sparse. The prices of cocoons in various villages in Wuxi are not very high. The cocoon banks in various markets and villages in Wuxi have successively opened scales for two or three days. Silkworm farmers' new cocoons have not yet been completely sold. The number of goods arriving on the market is not large. This year, a total of approximately 200 cocoon banks have been opened throughout the county. Due to continuous overcast and rainy weather in the two days after the opening of the scales, the number of goods arriving on the market is even smaller. There is more rain this year, and the quality of local cocoons is thin and inferior. Cocoon banks do not accept the cocoons. The cocoon prices in the four villages are roughly the same. The highest price for improved varieties is 70 yuan, and the lowest price for local varieties is 45 to 50 yuan. However, cocoon prices in the central region are relatively weak.</p>
<h3>Cocoon Market in the Lake Region Ends Separately</h3>
<p>Cocoon Production Still Abundant, Quality Also Good, Cocoon Prices Pull 61-62 Yuan</p>
<p>The harvest of new cocoons this year in the counties of Wuxing, Changxing, Deqing, Anji, and Xiaofeng in the Lake region is most abundant in Wuxing and Changxing, and least abundant in Anji and Xiaofeng. The average overall pull is five or six years. The current balance has been separately concluded. The most that each bank has received is 8,000 to 9,000 dan, and the least is 1,000 to 2,000 dan. The highest cocoon price is 70 to 72 yuan for foreign varieties (Wuxing, Nanxun, etc.). The lowest price for local varieties is 45 to 50 yuan (Anji, etc.). The average overall pull is about 61-62 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Zhenmei Tea Has Opened</h3>
<p>Anji Etc. Are 30-40 Liang Lower Than at the End of Last Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm tea market in this port saw a continuing downward trend in green tea. Many new styles of green tea from Lu Zhuang and local Zhuang green tea were displayed in various tea warehouses. Foreign firms' interest was very weak. Tunxi Zhenmei was heard to have opened a new plate at 125 liang, which was 30-40 liang lower than last year. Suian's first batch of Zhenmei arrived in Shanghai last week, but only three or four characters were opened, and 110+ liang were sold by boat, which was also 30+ liang lower than last year. On the other hand, the price of crude tea purchased by Anji, etc., in the interior was 16-17 yuan higher than before. In addition, the high price of rice, etc., recently increased the cost. In view of the sluggish sales of green tea and the significant losses, general tea merchants sent telegrams to interior Zhuang firms to stop producing all crude teas purchased and convert foreign firm box teas into shop Zhuang basket teas for sales in order to avoid repeating last year's mistakes. In the future, the volume of foreign firm teas will be reduced by approximately 60% compared to last year.</p>
<h3>Large Batches of Wuyuan North Road Tea Open for Weighing</h3>
<p>After various shops have collected the new tea from the southwest townships of Wuyi, the fine and tender teas are in short supply, and prices are also firm. Currently, the unsold teas stored by mountain households are either due to diverging market prices or due to inferior leaf quality. Therefore, the goal of various shops and water customers is to focus their attention on the mountain households on the North Road, where shop morale is not strong and tea prices are decreasing rather than increasing. In the past two days, many villages in the North Township have opened scales for discussion and weighing. It is estimated that the selling price of each dan of Gao'an is 62 yuan, Yanchuan Jinzhu Baishan Shi Village is 60 yuan, Gutan is 58 yuan, Hongyuan Huqiu is 73 yuan and 5 jiao, Jiang Village is 76 yuan, Fuxikou is 68 yuan, Wu Village is 62 yuan, Jia Village is 74 yuan, Yuntang Kaozi Wu is 74 yuan, and Huang Village is 62 yuan. At such mountain prices, shop families' intake is very keen. Large batches will continue to be weighed in the coming days. Several dozen firms in Sikou, Jinzhu, Zhangcun, Longteng, Jitai, etc., uniformly opened for selection, and the market was turning active. Zhenmei teas from the southwest township shop's first character have been undergoing baking recently and can be made into boxes soon. However, transportation in the Ganyu Le Ping area of Jiangxi is difficult due to recent bandit disturbances. Although it can be transferred to Shanghai via Tunxi, the land route is circuitous and very labor-intensive.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Han Gang Subsidiarily Purchases Eastern Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Piece goods trading is rather quiet due to the approaching old festive season. However, with the sharp rise in the Eastern exchange rate, the inferior trend of sudden shrinkage is unprecedented. Those engaged in this business are experiencing a state in which they cannot support themselves. Recently, rumors of closures among the industry have been rampant. Yesterday, Han Gang slightly subsided in terms of transactions. The reason is that the Eastern exchange rate is soaring, and fixed numbers have followed suit, so they have shifted to purchasing spot goods. Therefore, the winter seasonal goods of Eastern products did not rise sharply yesterday. However, Yuan Zhi Gong Ni (Tribute Wool) was the firmest, and Moganshan Lieyan Muqiu opened at 2 qian and 7 fen. Shuang Tong Lu (Double Boy Deer) was 2 qian and 4 fen, 5 li higher. Zhi Gong Duan (Tribute Satin) rose 2.5 li. The first Gong (merit) opened at 2 qian, 5 fen, 2.5 li. San Ma Tou (Three Horse Head) was 2 qian, 2.5 fen, and Wannian Youyu (Eternal Surplus) was 2 qian, 4 fen, 5 li. The Han Gang purchased all the above goods in large quantities. Since Yuehua Velvet has been arriving in Shanghai one after another, the price has fallen by 2.5 li due to oversupply. Yesterday, Yang Guifei Da Bing opened at 1 qian, 8 fen, 2.5 li. Qiba Zhong Bing was 1 qian and 7 fen and a half. The trend of Western goods is still stagnant. Only the 7-silk Sheng Luo in this street was slightly actively transacted, and the price was slightly softened. Most have been sold at 5 liang and 5 fen. Qiaoli's temporary Yin Dan Shi Lin bamboo cloth has also been stagnant recently. The overall trend needs to be activated in the autumn sales before there is hope of a turnaround.</p>

<h3>Indian Female Poet Mrs. Naidu</h3>
<p>A Champion of National Movements</p>
<p>Following Gandhi's leadership of the Indian non-resistance movement, female poet Mrs. Sarojini Naidu has also been arrested. Although Mrs. Naidu is a political activist in India, her reputation as a poet is well-established worldwide. We hereby introduce her as follows:</p>
<p>Mrs. Naidu had already written a long poem of 1,300 words at the age of thirteen. Although it was an imitation of Walter Scott's masterpiece (The Lady of the Lake), she wrote this long piece in one breath in six days, already demonstrating astonishing talent. This year, she further wrote a play called (Manmo-Mohan) in Persian. This play is still being performed in the Indian theater world and has won praise. Mrs. Naidu's collection of poems has been translated into various languages in Europe, and each of the more than 200 Indian dialects also has translations. Among them, many have been composed by giants such as Raimon and Tira.</p>
<p>At the age of twelve, the lady passed the entrance examination of Madras University. At the age of sixteen, she traveled to England alone to study at a specialized school in London. After studying for several years, she was baptized by modern Western European thought. Then, after returning to China, although she herself belonged to the Brahman nobility, she married a commoner male, which shocked her relatives. After returning to India, the lady's life became a passionate fighter for the Indian national revival movement. In 1925, she was elected chairman of the All-India National Congress. The lady was the first woman to attain this honorable position. Last year, she went to Europe and the United States to give lectures. On the way back, she originally intended to visit China and Japan, but due to the increasing tension in the domestic political situation, she hurriedly returned home.</p>
<p>Mrs. Naidu was born on February 13, 1879, in Hadrabad, Telegu Nadu. She is currently fifty-one years old. The lady's works include (The Broken Wing) and three other volumes of poetry, as well as recent lectures on social, cultural, and educational progress in India and pamphlets on the Indian women's movement. In 1914, the lady was elected a member of the British Literary Association, and in 1920, she was elected a member of the French Literary Association.</p>
<p>The lady has been arrested, arrested for her motherland. But perhaps a greater work can be produced again in this dark prison. If so, then the lady's imprisonment this time will be even more meaningful. (Wu)</p>
<h3>Modern Danish Literature (Continued) Notes by Tang Zenghie and Chen Xiehcheng</h3>
<p>Zhao Jingshen's Lectures at Fudan University</p>
<p>Johan Skjoldborg (1861 - ) He was the son of a gardener. In 1861, he wrote two books, "The Gardener" and "A Warrior," depicting the struggles of people in difficulty because he himself came from a poor background and sympathized with the poor. He did not have much faith in his father, and there was a lack of harmony between father and son. His works often dealt with social issues. In 1902, he wrote "Gyldholm," depicting the material and spiritual suffering of workers. In 1917, he wrote "New People," opposing the old system and sympathizing with modern trends. "Jon Jahob" (1920) and "The Pastor of Logdrn" (1921-1922) are works about father-son struggles. Recently, I saw an article by Skjoldborg titled "In Life and Death" in the Danish issue of "Scandinavian Review," which tells the story of two children playing in the countryside, fishing and swimming, growing up like flying arrows and becoming soldiers. The two children had a very good relationship. Later, when they grew up, one of them got married. The wife helped him every day, cooking and sewing for him. Their lives were very stable. One day, the married man went out and never came back. The other man was very suspicious and quickly prepared many boats. In the cold winter, he resolutely went out to look for him. He searched for a long time and couldn't find him. He was very angry. As dawn approached, he came to a place and suddenly saw a head in front of him. It turned out that the head belonged to his missing friend. He was overjoyed and tried his best to row over. His missing friend's boat had been broken by the ice and was gradually sinking into the river. He had fallen into the river in this way. Because the ice was very thick, only half of his body sank, and his head remained above the water. He was rescued by the unmarried friend the next morning. This section is very interesting. The description of the scenery in the article is also very good. We have seen Sudermann's film "Waves of the Sea of Love" ("Swn Rie"), which also has such a description. Skjoldborg wrote mostly about the farmers of Lumgjord and also depicted the scenery of nature. His writing is unadorned and extremely natural, containing understanding, sympathy, faith, life, and other emotions.</p>
<p>Jeppe Aakjær (1866 - ) was a Danish lyrical poet who expressed the life of farmers in his lyrical poems with a unique demeanor. He was also able to write novels, but his novels were overshadowed by the fame of his poetry, so people mostly talked about his poems and paid little attention to his novels. Three years ago, it was the 60th anniversary of his birth, and he wrote a book called "My Childhood," recalling his past experiences. Aakjær was the son of a farmer and still lived the life of a farmer himself. His family was very poor, so he started studying at a very late age. He didn't enter university until he was twenty-eight. After graduating from university, he worked as a teacher for a few years and also worked as a journalist. He accumulated a lot of money and then abandoned his careers as a lecturer and journalist, running to the Solling Peninsula to buy land and relive his youth as a farmer. He felt a great interest in farming, but he continued to study literature. During this period, he obviously made great progress. Aakjær was also a Jutlander (Jutlnd). Jutland is the mainland of Denmark, less affected by foreign invasions, and still retains some Nordic characteristics. Aakjær is one of the important figures in the "Jutland School." He compiled an annual report of Jutland writers and also compiled "Anthology of Jutland Literature." Aakjær describes the local scenery and feels a kind of humor in his lyrics. His observation point in society is radical and conservative. His novels include "A Farmer's Son" (1899), "The Sons of Danu" (1904), and "Boarding School" (1907). His poems include "Wheat Song" (1906) and "Hemdal's Trek" (1924) as his most famous works. Aakjær lives mostly among villagers. He does not want people's supplies and only seeks to supply himself. The houses in his village are not very good, the windows are often not opened, and the beds are only changed once a year, but the scenery outside the houses is excellent. Thus, this poet looks at the wide mountains covered with grains, the babbling rivers, the high sky, the soaring birds, and the brown earth in the embrace of nature, all of which give him infinite poetic inspiration. During the holidays, he and the farmers laugh and enjoy spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvest, showing a kind of delicate joy when they are ripe. His songs and poems have moving rhythms, mostly recollections of childhood memories.</p>

<p>Stories of World Literature (162) by Hamasi, translated by Hu Zhongchi</p>
<p>Chapter 41: German Literature After Goethe</p>
<p>Heine's works are probably of less value in themselves than his personality and influence. Today, it would be inexplicable to him to be discussed like Arnold as a successor to Goethe's genius in lyrical poetry. Heine's hundreds of early poems are lifeless and almost in bad taste. Fortunately, the entirety of his poetic works left behind the best of the "North Sea" series of legends. Stripped of the roses and joys of the early works, the most sincere and genuine content of his later poems shines through. His prose has not gained due fame. It is rich, light, eloquent, witty, and colorful. As he himself said, he seems to be a warrior in the war for the liberation of mankind, and his prose retains a record of that war in countless eloquent and passionate pages.</p>
<p>While Heine's reputation was at its peak in the mid-19th century, two great figures were working obscurely: Richard Wagner and Friedrich Hebbel. Wagner, even with his libretti and theoretical essays, does not strictly belong to literature, but is considered a great writer and an even greater thinker. Friedrich Hebbel, on the other hand, after years of difficult, unproductive solitude, conceived of modern drama, which first appeared in his works and then in the works of Ibsen and all the people who continued to be born. He shifted the drama's struggle from people embodying solemn moral concepts to those concepts themselves. He brought the world and the history of civilization to the dramatic poet's court of judgment. He conceived of the drama that could first occur in an era when one (tradition) died and another arose, an era when man and his morality lived and died. His major works ("Maria Magdalene," "Herodes and Mariamne," "Gyges and His Ring," "Agnes Bernauer") are all explained by the tense and eloquent approach of dramatic action and reasoning that theory. Many years after Hebbel's death, his diary appeared, a record of a powerful and honest spirit, perhaps a more important work than his plays.</p>
<p>Two outstanding novelists belong to this era, the most famous Swiss writers, Theodor Fontane and Strasbourg Keller. Fontane was a pioneer of realist and even naturalist novels. He produced small but sure masterpieces like "Effi Briest" and "Confusions of Life." Keller is a figure of international importance. His lengthy novel "Green Henry," which is considered the story of his own inner development, is not entirely the easiest to read. His short stories, on the other hand, are masterpieces. Keller has an eye for seeing the wonderful humorous aspects of life, and sees the weaknesses of Swiss farmers and townspeople. He is a master of prose, and his stories, drawn from his country's past and present, belong to the healthiest and most pleasant type of 19th-century novel.</p>
<p>In Germany, as in France, the years between 1850 and 1870 saw the development of pure forms of poetry. The Munich School paralleled the Parnassian School in many interesting points. The head of this school was Paul Heyse, who wrote those long-famous novels and stories that today seem faded and weak, and his reputation should lie in a selection of extremely pure and clear poems. Paul Heyse also wrote beautiful romantic lyrics in the traditional German style, and Emanuel Geibel, who relied on solemn, bright, and refreshing couplets, was considered a national poet for many years. However, the best poet writing in German was another Swiss, Conrad Ferdinand Meyer. In him, the clarity and gentle eloquence of the "aesthetic poet" are combined with high idealism and seductive music.</p>

<h3>Women's Life in Hailufeng by Peng Chenghui</h3>
<p>Hailufeng is the name of two adjacent counties in the southeastern part of the Dongjiang River in Guangdong, bordering Huizhou and Chaozhou. These two counties were originally one, called Luan County. Later, due to the feeling that the area was too wide and there were many difficulties in management, it was divided into Haifeng and Lufeng. The people living there can be roughly divided into two parts. One part speaks Hakka, and the other part speaks Hoklo (i.e., Chaozhou dialect). However, the number of people who speak Hoklo is relatively larger, and they mostly live in the vicinity of the city and the southeastern part of the city, while the Hakka people (i.e., those who speak Hakka) mostly live in the northwestern part of the city. Because the vicinity of the city and the southeastern part are mostly plains with few mountains, and because of the different languages, the customs and habits of these two groups of people are different, and the lives of women are also different. Now I will first talk about the lives of Hakka women, and then talk about the lives of Hoklo-speaking women.</p>
<p>I remember that Pan Guangdan's translation of "Natural Selection and Chinese National Character" mentioned that the Hakka people in China were the earliest to develop, and this can be clearly illustrated by the fact that their women do not bind their feet. This is indeed true. Hakka women in any part of China do not bind their feet. Therefore, Hakka women in Hailufeng all have natural feet. They regard natural feet as beautiful and refreshing, and regard bound feet as ridiculous and obstructive. Because they have natural feet, they can help men with work. When they are at home, they like to weave cloth. Many of them can weave enough cloth for their own use and no longer buy cloth from outside. In addition to cooking, weaving, and other household chores, as long as they have time, they help men with work outside. Therefore, in Hailufeng, wherever there are Hakka territories, in the fields or in the mountains, you can always see the hard work of women. Especially the young girls, when going up the mountains to collect firewood or graze cattle, are very happy to let out their clear throats and sing a kind of harmonious and pleasant mountain song. If they happen to meet a man at that time, they will sing to each other, one song each. These mountain songs are not learned through hard work, but are a kind of temporary, natural expression. Therefore, none of the mountain songs they sing to each other are rigid, but are vivid and responsive, and the more they sing, the more diverse they become. This is the reason why so many valuable mountain songs can be produced in Lingnan. Naturally, the mountain songs they sing are mostly about love, and many even fall in love because of these songs. This is truly an admirable thing.</p>
<p>Because they mostly live in the countryside and because they have to help with work, they have no opportunity to apply powder to their faces, and they also don't like to apply powder. They consider applying powder to be laughable, but although they don't apply powder, they have another kind of natural and simple beauty. Moreover, because the places where they live are mostly surrounded by mountains and clear waters, their personalities are mostly beautiful and clever. Because they move a lot, their bodies are especially strong. Therefore, in any Hakka area of Hailufeng, you can often see young girls with rosy and pretty faces, healthy bodies, and lively personalities. This is not an intentional exaggeration, it is indeed the case. When it comes to dressing up, they like to comb their hair into that convenient and beautiful round head (they colloquially call it "Provincial City Head," "Provincial City" being the colloquial name for Guangzhou), and they don't like to comb their hair into that inconvenient and ugly "Big Dog Tail" that Hoklo-speaking people are used to combing (it is said that this kind of head is quite difficult to comb, shaped like a big axe head, very unsightly, and if you comb this kind of head, you don't dare to run fast, because if you run fast, the shape will not be correct, just like an axe head, and it will fall down). If they happen to see someone with this kind of head passing through their countryside, they will gather together and laugh as if they are watching something strange. From this, it can be seen that they not only have a transcendent attitude towards work, but also have a considerable love for aesthetic concepts.</p>
<p>As for the lives of Hoklo-speaking women, that is different, completely the opposite of the Hakka. They completely like to bind their feet, the smaller the binding, the better ("three-inch golden lilies, seven-inch waist") seems to be deeply imprinted in their minds and is a golden rule that will never be forgotten. Parents, in particular, rejoice if their daughters' feet can be bound small, because the smaller the binding, the more they can hope to marry a good husband with money and power. Therefore, no matter how uncomfortable or painful they are, they are willing to endure the foot binding. There are many who feel the pain, but do not have the courage to bind their feet small, so their mothers will beat them and scold them, saying that they are useless, forcing them to bind their feet as much as possible while shedding tears. This is truly an inhumane and heartbreaking thing. Because they have already bound their feet, they cannot help men with work. Therefore, they can only hide at home all day long. Those who are relatively wealthy are idle all day long, playing around, while those who are relatively poor do a kind of broken incense stick work (Hoklo people are particularly superstitious about temples and shrines, there are especially many, so the business of making broken incense sticks can be done all year round). They like to worship gods.</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>Therefore, whenever you step into a temple, you can see many women piously praying to gods and Buddhas, shaking sticks to ask questions, and constantly mumbling such cheesy words as "Buddha, Grandpa, bless me with boundless fortune, six animals safe and sound." They like to apply rouge and powder to their faces when it comes to makeup, and they apply it very thickly. Therefore, in any Hoklo-speaking area of Hailufeng, you can always see that the faces of women are as white and ugly as plaster statues. They like to comb their hair into that kind of big dog tail mentioned above, and the bigger and thinner they comb it, the more beautiful they think it is, and they protect it very carefully, not allowing anyone's hand to touch it, because once it is touched, the shape will change. Because they are mostly idle at home and have nothing to do, they like to eat. In addition to two meals of rice at noon and in the evening, and a meal of porridge in the morning, they also eat several meals of tea (mixed with vegetables and dried rice). Therefore, some of them eat almost six or seven meals a day. They are very good at eating tea, and can easily eat four or five bowls at a time. When eating, they do not use chopsticks, but use their hands as chopsticks. This is indeed a ridiculous thing. Also, because they bind their feet, move little, and are confined at home like prisoners all day long, their personalities are not as lively and healthy as those of the Hakka.</p>

<h3>Record of a Visit to the Texaco Western District Service Station</h3>
<p>The once-lonely western section of Avenue Joffre has gradually flourished due to the shift in the city's population center. All the empty spaces have slowly been filled with summer houses. However, one particular piece of land, due to its location and size, remained barren a year ago. Only now has it found excellent use, thanks to the Texaco Oil Company. This piece of land is located at the intersection of Avenue Joffre, Rue Pere Robert, and Route Ferguson, a prime location indeed. However, it was a pity that the land was too small and triangular, unsuitable for residential or large-scale construction. In the end, the Texaco Company took a liking to it.</p>
<p>The Texaco Company completely transformed this triangular piece of land, constructing a large concrete road that runs across it, connecting Avenue Joffre and Rue Pere Robert. On the west side of the road, they built an office with two rooms. In the middle of the road, six or seven gas pumps are arranged. The two largest are for gasoline, and the rest are for lubricating oil. There is also a sign that reads "Gas and Water." The open space in front of the road is covered with green grass, and the word "TAXICO" is inlaid with flowers. Passersby are attracted by the green grass and red flowers. At night, the bright lights shine from the greenery, making the scene especially charming.</p>
<p>One spring evening, I strolled leisurely and came across this new Texaco service station. Without hesitation, I went in to visit. A middle-aged attendant greeted me warmly and kindly. After I explained my purpose, I asked:</p>
<p>"How many kinds of services does this service station offer? May I know?"</p>
<p>"Of course, sir. Our services include refueling, car repair, tire inflation, water filling, and car washing, among others."</p>
<p>"Are you the only attendant?" This might be because I often saw him alone inside.</p>
<p>"No, two people take turns every day."</p>
<p>"About how many cars do you refuel each day?"</p>
<p>"It's not fixed, but on average, we sell about a hundred gallons a day."</p>
<p>We seemed surprised because I rarely saw him doing business. Perhaps the business hours were not in the evening.</p>
<p>"Then, how are you compensated?"</p>
<p>"Our fixed salary is very limited. However, we get a commission of one cent for every gallon we sell. The more business we do, the more we earn. If we sell a hundred gallons a day, we can earn one dollar."</p>
<p>At this moment, we saw a motor inside and couldn't help but ask:</p>
<p>"What is this machine used for?"</p>
<p>"It's for inflating tires. It's powered by electricity and works very well."</p>
<p>Naturally, it is very difficult to solve the problem of inflating tires when cars travel to places far from the city. Such equipment is essential. Outside, there is also a narrow, elongated dry pool. He said that this pool is used for washing cars and refueling and repairing cars. The car is parked on the pool, and the service personnel stand below to work, which is both safe and convenient. The car repair is done by a foreign engineer, who is only here during the day and leaves after 6 p.m.</p>
<p>"How are the gas pumps arranged outside?" I was intrigued by the many red pillars.</p>
<p>"The two large pumps are for gasoline. One pump is slightly better, with each gallon costing 85 cents, and the other costs 82.5 cents. In addition, there are four types of motor oil: Extra Heavy, Heavy, Median, and Light. Texaco's motor oil is especially famous worldwide. Each gallon costs more than four yuan, which is expensive, but it is popular among the general public. There is also a sign that reads 'Gas and Water,' which indicates tire inflation and water filling. Tire inflation and water filling are free of charge for promotional purposes. The gasoline is transported from the head office and can carry more than a thousand gallons at a time," he told me incessantly.</p>
<p>"Are transactions cash or credit?" I thought of this because perhaps the passengers did not have money with them. What would happen then?</p>
<p>"It's not fixed. Cash is certainly acceptable. If the customer doesn't have money, they can fill out a form, stating the car number and address. The head office will send someone to collect the money."</p>
<p>In addition to telling me the above information, he also told me an interesting story about purchasing this land. He said, "This land was originally rented for a value of five thousand taels for ten years. But now, it has been bought. However, what outsiders would never have imagined is that this small triangular piece of land, in addition to what the company has purchased, also has some rented land, that is, the land outside the road, six feet away, is still not owned by the company. The owner of this small piece of land is a villager. The company has repeatedly contacted him, but he is unwilling to sell. The price offered was very high, but he would not sell it no matter what. Therefore, we had to rent it from him." I couldn't help but laugh when I heard this.</p>
<p>The twilight around me gradually faded. I knew everything I wanted to know. I said goodbye to the attendant. As I was leaving, he gave me a "Car Lubrication Manual." In addition to publishing information on how to add lubricating oil to various cars, there was also a photograph of the Texaco Head Office in Houston, which was magnificent and grand.</p>
<p>I finally said goodbye to him, thinking all the way that the Texaco Company was able to choose this excellent location for its western district service station. The future development can be said to be limitless. Therefore, on the one hand, we admire the company's foresight, and on the other hand, we wish the company an infinitely bright future.

<h3>The Strong and Great Marmon Eight-Cylinder Car</h3>
<p>Made of Many Advantages</p>
<p>Those who purchase cars this year pay attention to the car's engine, economical operation, durability, aesthetics, and comfort. Marmon's sales staff are constantly studying these points in order to cater to the psychology of customers. Nine out of ten investors in cars hope that the car they purchase has sufficient engine power, excellent operation, and can meet the needs of modern cars. However, to obtain an economical, reliable, and perfect car, you must choose carefully.</p>
<p>Mr. Galette, the sales director of Marmon, said that the latest eight-cylinder cars have the above characteristics. You don't have to replace it after purchasing one this year because it is always strong and its reputation will not diminish. Although there are also advantages and disadvantages of eight-cylinder cars, you must recognize the most experienced manufacturers of eight-cylinder cars when purchasing, because their products are the most durable, the most economical, and the most durable.</p>
<p>Since the Marmon car factory built the eight-cylinder car, it has only been four years, and this year it has completely manufactured all kinds of eight-cylinder cars, including the Marmon six-ninth-style sedan, the seventy-ninth eight-cylinder car, the eight-lack car, and the Marmon extra-large sedan. It is a pioneering move to create various eight-cylinder cars in the shortest time.</p>
<p>The new Marmon products have many advantages, such as high-pressure engine power and average car weight, evenly heated combustion chamber weight, extremely precise crankshaft, extremely precise connecting rod, smooth and lightweight interchangeable parts, tight pistons, and a Marmon tuner. In order to build a strong and durable body, the Marmon engineers have added countless advantages. The most obvious is the full-pressure oil system, which reaches all the smooth surfaces of the rotating engine, the extra-large oil pump, the automatically oiled windshield, the extra-large crank cover, the radiator and fuel power are extremely large, the mechanical oil pump, the heating water tank closer, the quick-acting water tank, the strong frame, and the surplus force box driver with rubber seat.</p>
<p>The 1930 Marmon new car has arrived in China in large quantities and is displayed in various management offices. The Shanghai manager is the well-known Shanghai Automobile Company.</p>

<h3>General Overview of Road Administration in Nanchang City, Wu Fei</h3>
<p>The road administration in Nanchang is not lagging behind. Generally, the engineering plan is designed according to the current needs and financial resources of the city. The following is a description of the recent survey: The second phase of the road collection plan includes all projects that have been completed or not completed in the first phase, which should be continued in the second phase, or projects that were not constructed in the first phase and are moved to this phase. There are eight roads: Desheng Road, Jinmai Road, which was not constructed in the first phase of the project and must be in this</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>The travelers will also be there. Huancheng Road is an unfinished project in the first phase and must be continued in this phase. Yonghe Road, Minde Road, and Zhangjiang Road are projects that have been completed in the first phase and must be continued in this phase. Sanmin Road is a two-way road connecting Huanhu Road and Zhongshan Road, which is designed and constructed in this phase to seek communication.</p>
<p>The establishment of a road maintenance engineering office and various teams of roads have been mostly completed. The cleaning and maintenance are necessary. Therefore, a road maintenance engineering office was established in January this year. In addition to the two cleaning teams specializing in the cleaning of old streets and the cleaning of various roads, there is a road maintenance team with one captain, one group leader, and 22 road maintenance personnel specializing in the maintenance of various roads and the candidates for old streets. The budget is 2,372 yuan per month. Later, due to special circumstances, it was 1,572 yuan per month, and there was a fee of 200 yuan per month for recruiting engineering trainees, which was also paid from this fund. In reality, only 1,372 yuan was paid.</p>
<p>Operation of public buses After Zhongshan Huanhu and Yanjiang Roads were completed, the roads were connected and the traffic was dense. In order to maintain safety and save citizens' time and money, the municipal government purchased four buses to operate in order to facilitate transportation. Therefore, the Public Bus Operation and Management Office was organized, with one director, one inspector, three ticket sellers, six staff members, two drivers, seven workers, and six monthly budget expenditures of 2,252 yuan. It is found that the current road is very short, no more than ten miles long, and is divided into twelve stations. Each station sells five copper coins, and the monthly income is about 3,400 yuan or less and 1,700 yuan or more. Its business is still sufficient to cover expenses.</p>
<p>Restrictions on commercial car operations Since the operation of public buses in this city, citizens have found it convenient, so many merchants have applied to the municipal government for approval to open car driving and issue licenses. The municipal government believes that the road is newly opened and the route is very short. The existing public vehicles are sufficient to cover the expenses, and all the surplus from the public bus business is allocated to the municipal government fund and road operation expenses. If commercial car operations are allowed to solicit passengers, it will conflict with each other, affecting the public's income and hindering the progress of the business. It seems that restrictions must be imposed. Therefore, it is absolutely forbidden to solicit passengers along the route of public bus operations, which should not harm the official business and benefit the municipal transportation. The rules for private individuals to open car driving are being revised to be followed.</p>

<h3>The Honor Award of the Flying Cloud 514</h3>
<p>The Thousand Mile Champagne Cup Race is one of the most important competitions in Europe and the most difficult car race in the world. The fourth race was held on April 12th and 13th. The race course was 1,640 kilometers long, winding and tortuous, almost encircling the entire Italian territory. The terrain was undulating and the rivers were crisscrossed. Driving on it was extremely dangerous. Therefore, the drivers and machines were subjected to very severe tests. The situation was serious and did not allow for a moment's neglect or complacency.</p>
<p>As a result of the competition, the Flying Cloud performed exceptionally well and won the championship again. When the 1,100cc race was held, the Flying Cloud car participants were the 509 type, driven by Mr. Apruzio and Mr. Barducci Ori. With a sound of mobilization, they sped away like falcons, and finally took first place in 21 hours, 20 minutes and 32 seconds, with an average speed of 76 kilometers, 0.191847 miles or 0.22 yards per hour. With this kind of car having this result, it is no wonder that its fame shocked the world and was praised by people. The second place was also the Flying Cloud 509 type, only eight minutes behind the first place at the end point, which can also be said to be fast.</p>
<p>What is even more commendable is that when the big car class race was held, the drivers were all veterans. The final victory was actually won by the Flying Cloud 514, the most popular new invention this year. The time was 23 hours, 14 minutes and 31 seconds, with an average speed of 70 kilometers, 0.519 (43 miles and 0.8 yards) per hour. The drivers were Mr. Massa and Mr. Panioni. The second place time was 23 hours, 31 minutes and 23 seconds. The drivers were Mr. Spodonno and Mr. Jirimjiri. The third place time was 23 hours, 41 minutes and 9 seconds. The drivers were the Jini brothers. The top two or three places were all won by Flying Cloud cars, so they were awarded the top prize, the Lamp Cup.</p>
