<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本又大地震</h3>
<p>近日美西海濱之大風加里福尼亞等洲。受損失甚鉅。歐西沿海各地之大風。比德法等國亦受災甚重。今日本復有二次大地震損失雖未必如前次之大。然觀其災區廣大毁物傷人不少。實又予日本以大打擊近日世界在此綿延不息之經濟與政治兩潮流中。各種天災。亦常若伴以綿延不息。此何故也。日本前次大地震。經全國上下一致之努力。至近頃而始完全復。興舉震災所遺物質。上一切慘澹之㾗迹。始消滅凈盡。然在精神上。尙不免留有多少苦痛。金解禁雖巳實行。然國民之生計財力。至今尙陷困境。亦未始非震災所遺之影響也。乃前次震災之苦痛。尙未盡忘。而二次震災又起。誠爲日人不幸。蓋日。</p>
<p>本自統帥權問題發生而後引起海軍界之爭潮。自濱口首相被刺而後。引起黨政間之波瀾。自世界經濟不振而後引起財政上之恐慌。巳足使日政府難於措手。今之二次地震雖出於天災之不可抗。然而將來籌辦救濟善後。又必不免加重一層困難而其國民在此喘息未遑之時。復被此意外之災禍。生活必更不安定。公私經濟。因此震災而愈絀。所謂不景氣。亦將因此震災而愈甚。此誠日本嚴重之時期矣。</p>

<h3>詹旭初談晉局</h3>
<p>被扣七月餘之經過</p>
<p>（南京）總部參議詹旭初、四月中旬、奉蔣令赴豫、接洽軍事、嗣應石友三召、偕姚以玠抵新鄉、十九晚被石密令扣留、翌日解太原、直至本月二十始釋放、詹氏昨巳回京、語記者以被扣經過、及閻馮現狀、與晋垣情形甚詳、茲擇要紀之如下、（一）被扣經過余奉令後、原擬由曹州經歸德至開封、嗣因石源人接洽、乃偕姚赴新鄉、過河後、石之參謀長巳先在、同乘汽車至新鄉、石初要求中央、在魯讓道通過、余答難辦到、十九晚在車站時、巳覺有人在後監視、迨余暗告姚、石巳令副官處長將余及姚扣留、並加鐵鐐、二十一石派六人解晋、閻亦派侯連長南下迎提、車過順德時、余與姚商、如你我同解太原、生命難保、因你與閻有惡感、若同走亦難如願、最佳你設法逃脫、余與閻無仇、任其解晋、至多受苦幾月而巳、遂乘守兵熟睡時、覓得剪刀一柄、將鐵鐐解脫、經某小站時、跳車而逃、迨守兵發覺、巳相距甚遠、余二十三到太原、押禁憲兵第一營部、共問兩次、以後並不提審、惟監禁甚嚴、當濟南克復時、趙戴文主張釋余、與中央接洽、嗣汪到石莊、仍主閻馮合作到底、乃作罷、至本月八日以後、待遇較優、至二十日始解放、並由憲兵司令李頴生招待、移住山西大飯店、殷勤欵待、並請回京後多說好話、余二十三離晋、今晨到京、共計被扣七月有餘、</p>
<p>（二）閻馮現狀閻駐河邊村、帶有衛士四十餘人、太原總部巳搬遷一空、稍佳器具、均搬回五臺原籍、尙有殘部數萬人、槍枝亦不甚足、軍事暫交徐永昌、政治交商震、馮駐距晋祠二十五里天虎山天龍寺、山只容單行、形勢極佳、且石洞甚多、可避飛機、隨從官兵、僅十餘人、惟閻派有便衣憲兵一排、馮部僅孫良誠約七八千人、餘均分散各處、巳無實力可言、閻馮初猶戀棧、現爲環境所迫、自量非走不可、所考慮者、出走方法耳、</p>

<h3>温州拒捐案昨又激起波濤</h3>
<p>解决案又推翻</p>
<p>百貨停止運滬</p>
<p>溫州各商帮、因永嘉統捐局將洋廣貨稅改征統捐、提出反對、實行罷運停稅、歷經一旬、至二十五日、始經商會調解、稅局亦允仍照舊章、風潮乃息、此事巳誌昨日本報、詎料昨日溫州商帮、恢復納稅運貨之第一日、正在報裝之際、而稅局方面、又突起波折、致巳經平息之風潮、頓又掀起巨大之惡濤、昨日記者赴各方面探詢、據本埠各商航所接到昨午溫州發來之急電、僉謂拒捐風潮、自二十五日調停解决以後、原擬今日照常裝貨復運、不意捐局翻案、致將巳議定之解决辦法、又全部推翻、溫州商界、對此異常憤慨、各業自今日（二十七號）起、又繼續拒捐停運、而形勢險惡、較前更甚、此事雙方巳漸次惡化、各趨極端、又招商局亦接到溫州分局電告、略謂捐潮翻案、百貨又停、廣濟輪本定二十六日開滬、巳經攬得運滬貨件、正欲裝運上船、不意變生意外、各貨臨時由客家提回、祇得仍放空船到申、暫買泥砂壓艙、來電簡略、未將變端述明、但情勢則十分險惡也、</p>
<h3>景山丸撞損新豐案肇禍責任問題</h3>
<p>證據分明將請公斷</p>
<p>如果不服再行海訴</p>
<p>招商局之新豐輪、在天津塘沽楊莊子被日船景山丸撞壞、來滬大修、貨物船身損失達四萬餘元、經該局向日郵近海社交</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>涉、要求賠償、早誌本報、茲悉此事巳經日人拒絶、且不認錯誤、亟將所聞分記如後、</p>
<p>肇禍責任分明　查景山丸撞壞新豐輪、係日船不依航海定例、逆水出口、照例對進口之順水船、應予避讓、當時新豐輪乘順水潮駛進紫竹林、因定例對面來船、須讓避而行、故懸綠燈於船首、不謂景山丸違反航行定則、致新豐被其軋撞、損失巨大、船主馬遜恐日人狡獪圖賴卸責、除當塲與景山丸船主交涉、取得該日人認錯之證明書外、又到津海關報請河舶司臨船檢騐、證明責在日人、故新豐索償理由、十分充足、</p>
<p>日人拒絶賠償　招商局根據船主馬遜報告、與日船長之引承軋撞之錯誤責任書、並將被撞損失之貨件船體等、總計四萬餘元、開具淸單、由局函致天津日郵社近海部分社、要求賠償損失、此函去後、昨聞天津日郵社巳有復函來滬、對於景山丸之肇禍責任、竟拒絶承認、而於新豐之貨輪損壞修理各費、亦不允付、來函語氣、相撞之責、似諉諸新豐、惟於兩船軋撞僅表示歉意、狡賴賠欵、不認錯誤、</p>
<p>此案將提仲裁　招商局接到日人圖賴責任之復函、聞業經討論對付之步驟、以此案責任分明、不容狡諉、日船主旣有親筆簽字之肇禍證、而津關河舶司又經到船騐明、述明此事責在日輪、故該局擬將該案、請津關公判、則肇禍地旣在天津、而公證人又爲津關河舶司、可使日人心折、不能再行施其狡僞技倆、萬一公判不服、則提出海事訴訟、</p>

<h3>姜渭漁脫險</h3>
<p>自稱從匪窟逃回…使烟酒妙計</p>
<p>一說花錢方贖出…大洋一萬元</p>
<p>閘北交通路六百八十七號姜祥興宰牛作主人姜渭漁、上月二十三日晚六時半、在門口被綁匪方面致函姜之家屬、索欵三十萬元勒贖、經渭漁之兄渭濱、用報紙找尋失物之廣告、與匪方接洽、詳情巳見本月二十四日本報所載、惟自肉票之兄二次登報後、即杳無音信、直至昨晨三時左右、姜渭漁忽然返家、自投閘北四區公安局太陽廟派出所、稱係從匪窟逃回、所有脫險情形、記錄如后、但據另一消息、則謂姜之脫險、實係出洋一萬元所贖出者云、</p>
<p>窟中情形　姜渭漁於昨晨三時十分許、投四區公安局太陽廟派出所、聲述脫險情形、大意謂自二十三日晚被綁後、在匪車見眼戴黑色目鏡、故車外情形、一、切不知、約過一小時、由二匪挾之下車、步行向前、有五六十分鐘之久始巳、到一屋中、即被監禁、其地似甚偏僻、不聞人馬聲息、祇有汽笛鳴聲、隱約可聞、看票者兩人、均操本地口音、命伊作函寄送家中、索欵三十萬元往贖、過四五日後、匪等將伊遷至小船上、其後又重返陸地、</p>
<p>烟酒妙計　姜稱匪窟中來往者、常有一二十人不等、或穿西服、或操國語、凡有接洽談話等事、匪必以面罩蒙在頭上、以防識破、匪窟中招待週到、飲食自由、如是者二三星期、姜忽籌得一策、欲、</p>
<p>圖逃脫、向匪詭稱、窟中生活無聊、度日如年、希望供給鴉片及酒、以資消遣、看票者奉上峯核准後、即每餐佐以村醪、並於夕陽將下華燈未上時、袖烟泡二三枚、令姜呑吸之、姜故作怡悅狀、懇於翌日多進兩枚、而私以饗之看票人、此兩看票者原係癮君子、得此意外之賜、視姜格外親密、而姜尤時以餘酒殘肴、作聯歡之用、</p>
<p>深夜逃回　如是者數日、姜每日進烟酒、而酒之量視烟尤甚、至前夜晚飯時、姜故意以多量之酒、留與看票者狂飲、至夜十一時許、而匪巳酩酊大醉、蜷臥地上、姜以機會巳至、即攝足而起、繞行室中、故作響聲、匪不起、亦不問、乃劃燐寸燭之、走至門外小便、待返、匪仍泥醉若死、姜推之不醒、祗聞口中　語、不知所云耳、姜至是膽大壯、推門而出、過一院落、又啓一門、始於黑暗中摸索得小路一條、扶壁以行、直達田徑、過一小溝、乃過大路、姜即狂奔疾走、不敢返顧、其時當巳午夜、如是春奔跑一小時、始見人跡、瞥見有人力車一輛、迎面而來、即躍登上車、命其向前拖行、約一刻鐘之久、忽達天通菴、因知離匪窟巳遠、而離家漸近、心中爲之大慰、至晨三時許、姜即安然回家、</p>
<p>叧有一說　以上所云、均係姜渭漁向警署所自述者、但另有一消息、則謂姜之脫險、實係出洋一萬元所贖出者、緣自肉票之兄渭濱登廣告、允價一萬五千元後、匪方尙不滿意、又三次致函票方、約於新世界飯店接洽、至時果有一衣服楚楚者前去、經承辦此案之探員尾之外出、隨其從大新街搭五路電車而行、到西門後、又換車至小南門、惜被覺察有人尾隨、移時即乘間兎脫、其後姜之家屬、即備欵往贖、因而釋放云、此說確否、雖不敢必、然以雙方幾次之接洽程度測之、或非無稽之談也、因併誌之、</p>
<p>被綁情形　姜渭漁於上月二十三日從宰牛作駕自備之送貨汽車送貨、往康腦脫路發行所、車行未幾、即遭綁架、匪共五人、均執手槍、此車至翌晨始在馬玉山路發現、而姜則從此不見、度其匪窟生活、直至昨晨、始狼狽返來、被綁時、身穿綠色絨線衫、夾短褲、昨日回家、衣服如舊、而人則憔悴不堪矣、</p>

<p>是日袁公靈櫬。在上海西門外斜橋紹興會館永錫堂出發。以馬車拖至閘北虬江路。改用中國搬塲公司之汽車。運往寳山公共體育塲。滬上送殯親友。除至車站折回外。赴寳山者。乘火車至吳淞下車。備有公共汽車接往寳山南門。體育塲内。是日特蓋明瓦廠。而門口高建素牌坊。廠内設一方桌。上供香案祭物。一時靈櫬抵塲後。運至塲中。改用材覃。時寳山各界代表。巳相率蒞塲。即在塲内舉行公祭。由浦擷英主祭。吳子剛司儀。禮節甚简單。（一）上香鞠躬。（二）奠酒鞠躬（三）與祭者全體三鞠躬。一時半由體育塲出發除象亭及銘旌亭外。有惠兒院之軍樂隊。以及各校學生各界代表。均臂圍黑紗。胸佩紙花。手持長香。魚貫進交泰門。馬路口有路祭。係吳士翹主祭。朝北至鼓樓。又有路祭。係王奏雲主祭。折而西。至縣校前。上懸「門牆灑淚」四字白布横額。由趙序東率敎職員在此路祭。蓋該校即三十年前爲袁公所手創。經師範入口前。又有路祭。該校校長朱家積率全校敎職員共同與祭。出西門。至墓地。在勤餘别墅後面。塲中特搭布蓬帳於墓廓之上。廓以水門汀所建。内塗紅色。并書袁公之生卒年月日時。下舖墓誌銘。棺外遍添硃紅色。頭畔有金字。文曰「中華民國公民顯考袁公諱希濤鄉諡弘毅先生之靈柩。」袁公介弟希溓希洛二先生。咸穿白衣。率闔族男女。環侍廓之四週。靈櫬入穴時。痛哭之聲。慘不忍聞。旋設祭台。執紼親友相率至廓旁環繞一週。退而行禮。然後封廓。寳山僻處海隅。雖係縣城。人口不多。是日四方來觀者。有萬人空巷之象袁公舊宅。向在南門内。巳破舊不堪。儀仗在此經過時。鄉人咸指示此屋。追述袁公誕生狀况。自公共體育塲起。繞西南城而達墓地。亦有數里之遙。光華大學敎授潘光旦君。因在淸華學校肄業時。跳高損足。截去一腿。行時以木架支撑。是日亦隨行恭送。予與君並行。沿途觀者。咸指示而笑。潘君亦領首以答。其敬仰袁公之誠心。較予等更勝一籌矣。公葬畢。巳下午三時。執紼者枵腹從事。毫無倦容。足徵袁公感人之深。旋赴黨部中膳。食畢。由招待員導至民衆敎育館。參觀袁公紀念塔。尙未竣工。高約二丈左右。下有石墩。質係水門汀。爲木棺所蔽。未見所刋文字。據云下月可以竣工。旋相率衆公共汽車至吳淞。改乘火車回滬。巳萬家燈火矣。歸而紀此。以表哀悼。</p>
<h3>日本俱樂部歡宴記</h3>
<p>— 馬孟容</p>
<p>上海日本三井銀行行長　土屋計左右氏。留滬任職十有四年。精幹謙和。彬彬爾雅。與吾華人士交誼甚篤。且雅好書畫。舉凡關於發展中日藝術之舉。氏尤提倡不遺餘力。中日藝術同志會之成立。氏贊助之力居多。近奉總行命。榮調回國。藝術會同志曾公餞之於梓園。復各作畫一葉。精裝成册。以贈别。昨日氏答宴於日人俱樂部。邀請海上各界雋流舊雨。及藝術同志。藉以話别。并介紹繼任行長平野助保氏。來賓約三百許人。中日各半。濟濟蹌蹌。極一時之盛。予近偶感冒。數日未出門。承邀乃前往與宴。旣入席首由土屋致辭。平野行長。重光公使。及張公權中行長。均有演說。席間令藝妓歌舞以侑觴。爲外間不多見者。隨錄之以實自由談。</p>
<p>歌舞共五闋。計日本式歌舞三。西洋式歌舞二。首爲長唄勸進帳。爲六三亭藝妓所奏。妓凡十人。前後二列分坐。操縵者二人。琴似忽雷。不以指彈。替以牙篦。批把成聲。擊小鼓者三人。男一奏笛以和之。聲調和靜。蓋唐時傳自吾國者。次爲舞踊玉川。亦爲六三藝妓所演。亦十人。三人鼓琴。三人唱歌。四人舞踊。惟琴者不歌。歌者不舞。舞者亦不歌。舞態翩翩輕如集羽。宛若游龍。有吾國之古風焉。嗣舞者增爲六人。各執色絹一幅。旋轉翻。飛。五彩眩目。如龍翔鳳翥。霞燦錦新。大可觀也。後奏祇園小唄佈秋郊月景。舞者四人。極靜穆之致。</p>
<p>西洋式跳舞二阕。一爲要慕利司克。次爲合懷若斯舞。爲虹口靑鳥跳舞塲舞女所演。純係西式之雙人舞及單人舞。舞者爲年未及䈂之女郎。天然曲線之美。顯露無餘。肌膚美滿。體態輕盈。手之舞之。足之蹈之。迅如飛燕。飄若驚鴻。形容盡致。表　人微。肉感深處。鼓掌之聲輒雷動。水手舞亦可觀。較法蒙特馬團有過之無不及。惜少妙曼之歌聲耳。</p>
<p>主人殷懃勸飲。藝妓亦按席進酒。來賓無不暢飲甚歡。席散每人贈糕果一盒。同志會攝影一張以誌念。</p>
<p>時英賓酒巳半酣。而餘興尙豪。予邀以同往天聲舞臺觀名票友朱雅南之金鎖記。英賓曰諾。遂與紅薇曼靑介堪同車往。至舞臺則英賓自言有醉意。須折回俱樂部。而予四人遂入座觀劇。少頃雅南登台。㬅聲宛轉。麗質天生。唱作並妙絶。方之梅啘華程玉霜無多讓焉。壁間滿列聯額書畫。相映成趣。余亦寫贈月下菊花鸜鵒一幅。題云佳色卓爲霜下傑。新聲恍似月中聽。以誌欽佩。劇畢返寓。時巳子夜。就枕不能成寐。乃泚筆以記之。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（八四）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>緬人奇俗甚多。將多訪之。除抓食外。則穿衣而洗澡。吾人所認爲怪事者也。此間天𤍠。每日冲凉。乃到緬甸則冲凉必穿褲。若在特别冲凉室。自可自由。而在人家租房共住之客。其冲凉無特别室。只一二尺高之板隔之。必須穿褲冲凉。余大以爲苦。而無如何。昔仰光大學曾因此事大起風潮。因華敎員不肯穿褲洗也。入境向禁入鄉問浴。風俗之力大于法律。不可不畏也。手抓吃飯穿褲洗澡。眞吾國奇聞。而彼之律例也。蓋緬人男女在大街可以洗澡換褲。其穿衣而洗。有需要故也。（此叚不易講明白甚費事故略之）老大藏經法顯傳述印度各地之俗。國王以手進食。然則雖國王亦如此矣。印度至今守其俗。然則佛昔時亦以手抓食也。若學佛者將亦學其以手抓食乎。一笑。因億及在晋時所得風俗。有二句曰。「床下燒火。屋頂耕田。」聞者亦必大怪。試解之。則北地冬天燒土坑。故煮飯亦於土坑行之。夜則寢於坑上取暖。大抵東三省亦然。而屋頂耕田。則高山坡之民。鑿土穴居。其土堅硬。穴中冬暖夏寒。亦適衛生。而穴頂爲山坡。照常種五穀也。余著世界風俗志。欲比較各地風俗以資研究。而袪人狹見耳。晋友又告余曰。在雁門關以北。常穿皮襖而吃西瓜。因彼地氣候暖。西瓜到八月後乃熟。天巳冷矣。故穿皮襖時瓜始熟也。今到南洋。則只有乾濕兩季。所謂不知春秋之語。於此騐之。</p>
<p>其天時則雨季最宜衛生。因雨後生微凉。約當我五月天氣。不知者以爲南洋當六七月必大𤍠。而實際則不然。現在陽曆七月。正上海六月。而吾在緬甸可穿夾衣。因雨後故也。夜非蓋一毯不可。雨季最宜衛生矣。緬甸雨季。自陽曆五月至十月。皆雨季也。雨季即濕季。十一月至四月爲乾季。乾季燥𤍠。人則畏之。</p>

<h3>Hu Yimin, Warden of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Prison, Assumed Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shao Lizi delivered a speech</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hu Yimin, Warden of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Prison, was sworn in on the 26th. More than 100 officials and representatives from various agencies attended. Shao Lizi presided over the oath-taking and delivered a speech, stating that during the period of recovering legal rights, reforming the prison system was more important than all politics. A good prison can reform and rehabilitate criminals, creating a new life for humanity and eliminating all the bad elements in society, thereby reducing the number of criminals. Comrade Hu has in-depth research on prison reform and hopes to make extra efforts to achieve progress. Yu Youren and Cao Haosen spoke afterward, both emphasizing the point of rehabilitation to conform to the purpose of having no punishment in the end. Hu finished his reply, took a photo, and dispersed. The internal organization of the prison is divided into three sections: general affairs, management, and crafts. There are also two departments: education and medical affairs. The cells adopt a progressive system and can accommodate more than 1,000 people. There are currently more than 800 people. The workshops are divided into more than ten subjects, including printing, woodworking, rattan and bamboo weaving, dyeing and weaving, shoemaking, towel and sock making, sewing, farming, construction, laundry, and barbering. The entire area occupies more than 90 acres, and the construction cost is more than 300,000 yuan. It is truly an unprecedented new prison administration. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Proposes to Recover the Japanese Concession in Hankou</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the recovery of the Japanese concession in Hankou, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has submitted a note to Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu on the 23rd. Shigemitsu must first consult with his government before further consultation. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This time, the Chinese side suddenly proposed to recover the Japanese concession. It is said that it was a new addition to the diplomatic policy for the 20th year of the Republic at the recent Fourth Plenary Session: (1) Negotiate with various countries to withdraw troops stationed in China; (2) Specific leased territories and concessions of various countries must be recovered by the middle of next year, and the National Government orders the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle it. In addition, the four Japanese concessions in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shashi, and Chongqing that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has investigated since last year must also be recovered. Preparations have been made to make a second proposal to Japan. (Telegram from the 26th by the Electric Communications Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Wang Zhengting suddenly sent official documents to Japan and France yesterday, demanding the unconditional recovery of the Hankou concession. After this news spread to Tokyo, it caused a profound shock to all parties. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet expressed any intention. After studying the content of the proposal, it will discuss what measures to take. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the Sino-Japanese treaty negotiations are about to restart, and the issue of concessions and exclusive settlements is part of the issue of jurisdiction and is naturally included in these negotiations. Now, suddenly deviating from these negotiations and demanding unconditional recovery is difficult for the Japanese government to understand. It intends to clearly express that this proposal cannot be immediately agreed to and will instruct Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu to reply to Wang within this week. (Telegram from the 26th by the Electric Communications Agency)</p>

It has been decided that our side will propose a counter-proposal, and after it is drafted, it will be submitted to the British side for discussion. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Shi Yousan arrived in Tianjin by special train at 10:00 a.m. on the 26th from Shunde with Secretary-General Zhang Yungui, Adjutant Yang Tianzhou, and Artillery Commander Lin Jiaxun, to welcome Zhang Xueliang going north and to discuss undecided matters regarding the army.

This kind of craftsmanship will be popularized throughout the army in the future. Our country's production is backward, and the country is poor and the people are impoverished. I am very willing to entrust the army to someone and engage in industry as a private citizen. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<h3>Another Major Earthquake in Japan</h3>
<p>Recently, the great wind on the west coast of the United States, in states such as California, has caused great damage. The great wind in various parts of Western Europe has also caused severe disasters in countries such as Germany and France. Now, Japan has suffered another major earthquake. Although the damage may not be as great as the previous one, the disaster area is vast, and many things have been destroyed and people have been injured. This is another major blow to Japan. In the recent world, amidst these continuous economic and political trends, various natural disasters also seem to be continuously accompanied. Why is this? After the previous major earthquake in Japan, through the united efforts of the entire country, it was only recently that it was completely rebuilt. The material and all the tragic traces left by the earthquake were finally completely eliminated. However, in terms of spirit, it is inevitable that some pain remains. Although the lifting of the gold embargo has been implemented, the livelihood and financial resources of the people are still in distress. This may not be unrelated to the impact left by the earthquake. However, the pain of the previous earthquake has not yet been completely forgotten, and a second earthquake has occurred. This is truly unfortunate for the Japanese. It is said that Japan.</p>
<p>Since the issue of supreme command arose, it has triggered a wave of disputes in the naval community. Since the assassination of Prime Minister Hamaguchi, it has triggered waves of conflicts between the party and the government. Since the world's economy has been sluggish, it has triggered panic in finance. This is enough to make the Japanese government difficult to cope with. Although the second earthquake is due to the irresistible force of natural disasters, it will inevitably add another layer of difficulty to the future planning of relief and reconstruction. When the people are out of breath, they are once again hit by this unexpected disaster, and their lives will inevitably become more unstable. Public and private economies will become more impoverished due to this earthquake. The so-called recession will also become more severe due to this earthquake. This is truly a serious time for Japan.</p>

<h3>Zhan Xuchu Talks About the Shanxi Situation</h3>
<p>The Experience of Being Detained for More Than Seven Months</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhan Xuchu, a counselor of the General Headquarters, went to Henan in mid-April under Chiang's order to discuss military affairs. Later, in response to Shi Yousan's invitation, he went to Xinxiang with Yao Yijie. On the evening of the 19th, he was secretly ordered to be detained by Shi and escorted to Taiyuan the next day. He was only released on the 20th of this month. Zhan returned to Beijing yesterday and told reporters in detail about the experience of being detained, the current situation of Yan and Feng, and the situation in Shanxi. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) The experience of being detained: After receiving the order, I originally planned to go to Kaifeng via Caozhou and Guide. Later, due to Shi Yuanren's contact, I went to Xinxiang with Yao. After crossing the river, Shi's chief of staff had already arrived and took a car to Xinxiang. Shi initially asked the central government to allow passage in Shandong, but I replied that it was difficult to do so. On the evening of the 19th, at the station, I already felt that someone was monitoring me from behind. When I secretly told Yao, Shi had already ordered the chief of the adjutant's office to detain Yao and me and put us in iron shackles. On the 21st, Shi sent six people to escort us to Shanxi. Yan also sent Company Commander Hou to the south to welcome us. When the train passed through Shunde, Yao and I discussed that if we were both escorted to Taiyuan, our lives would be difficult to protect because you and Yan had grievances. If we went together, it would be difficult to fulfill our wishes. The best solution was for you to find a way to escape. I had no feud with Yan and would be escorted to Shanxi. At most, I would suffer for a few months. So, while the guards were asleep, I found a pair of scissors and removed the iron shackles. When I passed a small station, I jumped off the train and fled. When the guards discovered it, I was already far away. I arrived in Taiyuan on the 23rd and was imprisoned in the first battalion of the gendarmerie. I was interrogated twice, but not after that. However, the imprisonment was very strict. When Jinan was recovered, Zhao Daiwen advocated releasing me and contacted the central government. When Wang arrived in Shijiazhuang, he still advocated that Yan and Feng should cooperate to the end, so it was abandoned. After the 8th of this month, the treatment was better. I was released on the 20th and was entertained by Li Yingsheng, the commander of the gendarmerie. I moved to the Shanxi Hotel and was treated with great care. He also asked me to say good things after returning to Beijing. I left Shanxi on the 23rd and arrived in Beijing this morning. I was detained for more than seven months.</p>
<p>(2) Current situation of Yan and Feng: Yan is stationed in Hebian Village with more than 40 guards. The Taiyuan headquarters has been completely evacuated. Any good equipment has been moved back to Wutai, his ancestral home. There are still tens of thousands of remnants, and the firearms are not very sufficient. Military affairs are temporarily handed over to Xu Yongchang, and political affairs are handed over to Shang Zhen. Feng is stationed in Tianlong Temple on Tianhu Mountain, 25 miles from Jinci. The mountain can only be passed by a single file, and the terrain is excellent. There are also many stone caves that can avoid airplanes. There are only a dozen or so followers and soldiers. However, Yan has sent a row of plainclothes gendarmerie. Feng's department has only about seven or eight thousand people under Sun Liangcheng. The rest are scattered everywhere and have no real strength to speak of. Yan and Feng initially still loved their posts, but now they are forced by the environment and realize that they have to leave. What they are considering is how to leave.</p>
<p>(3) Situation in Pingyuan: After the Shanxi army retreated, the people of Shanxi felt uneasy. When the central government's planes bombed several times, they became even more frightened. Taiyuan can be said to have caves everywhere and houses everywhere. The Shanxi army set up dozens of anti-aircraft guns. When they learned that the planes were coming but had not yet arrived, they immediately released the air whistle from the power plant as a signal. The people immediately entered the underground houses, and the anti-aircraft guns prepared to fire. The most affected areas were Jin City, Yun City, Pingding, Yiqin Prefecture, etc. Many people were also killed and injured.</p>
<p>Zhan also said that Yan's failure had three reasons: one was that the people were drafted from each county according to household registration. Because they all had families and did not rely on military pay for a living, they fled when they saw the enemy and were transported back to Taiyuan. The wounded soldiers were all shot in the.</p>
<p>backs. Two, the officials and soldiers who were registered in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan relied on military pay for a living, but each person received only eight yuan and three cents of Shanxi notes per month, which was only four yuan in cash, so they could not live and did not advance in battle. Three, the newly established security teams had several divisions, but the pay was meager and owed, and there was no training. They retreated without fighting in Shandong, resulting in the annihilation of the entire army. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Dentsu Agency, Tokyo, 26th: The Shizuoka Prefecture Police Department initially reported to the Metropolitan Police Department by telephone that there were 900 deaths and injuries. However, after careful investigation, the correct number is between 100 and 150. The area with the most severe tremors was near Ooba and Ohito, south of Mishima. Fortunately, the population there is sparse, and the damage is not great.</p>
<p>Dentsu Agency Report: Fires broke out in Mishima, Numazu, and Awashima and are currently burning. Three houses collapsed in front of Awashima Station, but there was no other major damage. Three houses collapsed in Ajiro. A fire also broke out in Ito Town and is currently spreading. The town office in Mishima Town has collapsed, and government offices are severely damaged. 36 houses collapsed, with 4 injuries. The police released three prisoners.</p>
<p>Dentsu Agency Report: According to the Ministry of Railways, as a result of this morning's earthquake, all trains on the Tokaido Line are unable to move forward or backward. Telegraph and telephone communications were completely cut off for a time but have now been restored at one station.</p>
<p>Dentsu Agency Report: Due to this morning's major earthquake near the Izu Nagaoka Onsen, many bridges collapsed, roads were destroyed, and houses collapsed. In this cold weather, people who have lost their homes are afraid of further aftershocks, and are rushing back and forth, in a very tragic state. In addition, the dikes of a certain river (code unknown) nearby collapsed, and the river flooded, washing away countless houses, killing more than 20 people, and many are missing. The area is in a state too tragic to witness. Details are under investigation.</p>

<h3>Italian and Russian Diplomatic Officials Meet</h3>
<p>Purely Economic in Nature</p>
<p>Reuters, Milan, 25th: Yesterday's talks in Milan between Italian and Russian diplomatic officials were purely economic in nature. The "beat and scold party" failed to influence the Red Party and was also unable to be influenced by the Red Party. After this conversation, Russia has agreed to exchange Russian raw materials for Italian manufactured goods. Therefore, Russia will supply Italy with wheat, oil, and wood in exchange for machinery, automobiles, airplanes, and ships. There are no financial issues, as it is purely a barter trade.</p>
<h3>German Minister of Justice Resigns</h3>
<p>Disagreement with Brünning</p>
<p>Political Prospects Become Increasingly Dim</p>
<p>National Society, Berlin, 25th: German Minister of Justice, Professor Bredt, has resigned. Bredt has been a representative of the Economic Party and does not approve of the government's receiving secret support from the Social Democratic Party. He advocates joining forces with the National People's Party and the National Socialist Party. He disagrees with Chancellor Brünning and has therefore left the cabinet to join the opposition party. Bredt has resigned as a result. In the future, the cabinet will be in an absolute minority position in the parliament, and the prospects for its budget and financial reform plan will become increasingly dim. Government officials expect that Brünning will no longer hesitate and, if the plan cannot be passed, will request to issue it by administrative order under Article 48 of the Constitution.</p>
<h3>Trial of Anti-Revolutionary Case in Soviet Russia Opens</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 26th: The trial has now opened for a case in which eight professors and engineers were accused of being involved in anti-revolutionary activities, initiating sabotage in order to overthrow the Soviet government and restore the power of the middle class. According to the Russian Official Communications Agency, there were continuous worker parades outside the court during the trial, and over a million people distributed leaflets with the words "We demand that the civil court express a firm attitude." One of the defendants, Lamsin, confessed that the "French Intervention Committee" was overseen by General Hénin of the French Army General Staff and that the British Army General Staff was also involved. He also stated that France did not want to send troops during the war, but only provide military trainers or naval airships. Poland and Romania must supply troops, and they also planned to use White Russians overseas.</p>
<h3>British Newspaper's Commentary on China's Situation</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th: Today's Times editorial, entitled "Good News from China," stated that there are two things that give rise to the hope that China's future is more pleasant than before. Now the more sensible people in the Kuomintang have resolutely admitted that the party is not omnipotent, and the two commanders who finally won the civil war have also clearly admitted that China cannot be governed on horseback.</p>

<h3>He Chengjun Returns to Hankou</h3>
<p>Makes a Statement to Reporters</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Chengjun, acting commander of the Wuhan Xingying, attended the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Nanjing. After the meeting, he went to Shanghai for medical treatment on the 22nd due to stomach problems. Believing that government affairs and bandit suppression matters were important, he took a postal flight from Shanghai to Hankou at 7:00 AM on the 25th. The Xingying and the provincial government had already received He's telegram, notifying various agencies and groups to prepare a welcome. Those who went to Wangjiadun Airport to meet him on that day included Xu Yuanquan, commander of the 16th Route; Xia Douyin, commander of the 21st Route; Chen Guangzu, chief of staff of the Xingying; Wu Xingya, acting chairman of the provincial government; Fang Dazhi, director of the Construction Department; Huang Jianzhong, director of the Education Department; Committee members Peng Jieshi, Xiong Bingkun, and Xie Lu; Secretary-General Hua Jueming; Liu Wendao, mayor of Hankou; and representatives from various agencies, groups, and schools. The 1st Battalion of the 1st Supplementary Regiment of the 48th Division and the Security Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau were responsible for perimeter security. At 3:10 PM, the China Airlines postal flight arrived at the airport. Military music played loudly and cheers rang out. After He got off the plane, he greeted the welcomers one by one and then, along with Fan Shisheng, commander of the 51st Division, and Xu Langxi, chief of staff of the 3rd Army, got into cars and returned to their private residences to rest. At 4:00 PM, He went to the headquarters of the 3rd Army and talked with the two commanders Xu and Xia and Acting Chairman Wu and Mayor Liu about the military and political situation after he left Hankou. After about ten minutes, he met with reporters and made the following statement: "I went to Nanjing this time to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. Because Vice Commander Zhang was coming to Nanjing, I went a day or two earlier to prepare for the welcome and reception. After the meeting, I took the opportunity to go to Shanghai for treatment due to illness. I was only able to return to Hankou today. The results of the Fourth Plenary Session were excellent. All the resolutions made, which are related to long-term plans, have been handed over to the responsible agencies for handling. As for the post-war affairs in the north, General Chiang Kai-shek and Vice Commander Zhang are currently discussing them in Nanjing and have come to a proper solution. When I left Nanjing, the Taiyuan Garrison Commander Rong Honglu came to Nanjing to pay respects to the Commander-in-Chief and ask for instructions. He said that Yan and Feng have decided to go abroad within days, and the northwestern provinces are completely listening to the orders of the Central Government. Vice Commander Zhang is now stopping over in Shanghai and will return north soon to preside over everything. General Chiang Kai-shek will come to Hankou after Vice Commander Zhang goes north to inspect the bandit situation in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, and to supervise and order the troops to encircle and suppress them according to the plan. Believing that the bandits will be cleared within the scheduled time." (25th)</p>
<h3>Repeated Negotiations Regarding the "Wanshin" Steamer Incident</h3>
<p>The Hankow Municipal Government Sends Another Letter to the Japanese Consul</p>
<p>Hankow Dispatch: The case of the Japanese naval vessel colliding with and sinking the "Wanshin" steamer has been repeatedly negotiated by the Municipal Government without result. Instead, the Japanese Consul has presented a defense to the Municipal Government, making many accusations. The Municipal Government, on the 25th, sent another letter to the Japanese Consul, refuting each point of the defense and requesting that the previous letter regarding compensation for losses be reviewed. The Director of the Health Bureau, Li Boren, was also sent in person to negotiate. The original letter is excerpted below:</p>
<p>"Regarding your esteemed letter of October 30th concerning the collision and sinking of the "Wanshin" merchant steamer by your country's naval vessel, in which you made two accusations and forwarded a rebuttal from the commander of the "Shibuya Hirato" warship for our review, requesting that the shipping company "Xinghan," the owner of the ship, acknowledge the conditions previously proposed by the navy, we have carefully reviewed the same. Upon investigation, the two accusations in the letter are completely untrue, and the "Shibuya" commander's rebuttal also contains many contradictions and misunderstandings. We hereby refute them one by one as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the first point, which vaguely states that there was no instance of passengers being prevented from disembarking with guns after the "Hanhua" (i.e., "Wanxin") incident, only that a staff officer belonging to the headquarters within the "Ataka" warship used his bare hands to prevent everyone from disembarking at once. Upon investigation, after the "Hanhua" was damaged in the collision, water poured in profusely. The ship's chief mate, in order to protect the lives of all passengers, urgently steered the ship close to shore. In this critical moment of life and death, anyone with a modicum of humanity would be trying to rescue them, how could they be prevented? Even if, as stated in the letter, the method of prevention was by hand and not by gun, the effect of not allowing passengers to disembark would be no different than a means of causing death. If it was considered there was no danger, why prevent it? At the time, the "Hanhua" sounded its whistle first, and the passengers cried for help after, the dangerous situation was known to all. The staff officer still believed that the collision was minimal and would not cause a critical event, how ignorant of the situation could they be? Even more strange is that the original letter speculates that the cause of the "Hanhua" sinking did not occur before the passengers disembarked, but after. We wonder on what basis is this claimed? In ordinary theory, once the passengers have disembarked, the load is empty and the draft is very shallow, the ship is already in a safe state, how could the cause of sinking occur? This kind of cause was definitely before the passengers disembarked, there is no doubt about that.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the second point, which states that the "Hanhua" captain's attitude at the time of the incident was puzzling. The ship sailed in the naval machinery bridge area, where ordinary ships are not allowed to enter or exit, after colliding with the "Hinode Maru." It then continued to dock at the pier, allowing passengers to disembark, and then moved the machinery, colliding with the wooden bridge connecting the machinery bridge to the shore, breaking four bridge timbers, before moving close to the shore and sinking. Upon investigation, if the "Hanhua" had only suffered a minor collision and was not far from the company's pier, there would have been no difficulty in sailing to its own pier for berthing. Why would it need to dock at the naval pier? Even if it had forcibly entered, the dozens of people on board, not having reached their destination (i.e., the company's pier), would certainly not be willing to disembark. Furthermore, let's concede for a moment: if, as stated in the letter, the machinery was started after the passengers disembarked and the machinery bridge was broken, then the "Hanhua's" serious damage must have been to the bow and definitely not to the midships. Moreover, if the ship had no insurance, what could be the "ulterior motive" in seeking compensation?</p>
<p>As for the points in the "Shibuya" commander's rebuttal: (1) He states that it is difficult to accept that the "Wanxin" captain stopped the engine and reversed before the collision. He claims that the "Wanxin's" forward momentum was naturally very great at the time of the collision, and that even after the collision, the "Wanxin" would have reached the naval pontoon by its own inertia. Upon investigation, after the "Wanxin" sounded its whistle and reversed, the Public Security Bureau conducted investigations from all sides, and the testimonies were consistent. Even Consul Tanaka stated that it was indeed the case. Now the letter states that even if stopping the engine and reversing were true, it must have been after the collision and did not raise any sufficient evidence and concrete reasons, which is unavoidable arbitrary. (2) He states that the Wuchang Customs surveyor mistakenly identified the circumstances of the collision as being the same as previously described. He claims. The surveyor, Mr. Jin's original report stated that he asked Wuchang Customs' Mr. Mao, and that colleague and himself were viewing from the Jiang An (riverbank) that afternoon. He did not point out where the office building was. Now the letter insists that he was in front of the office and could not see the situation of the collision, which is a mistake. (3) He states that when the surveyor, Mr. Jin met with Consul Tanaka, they thought that the damaged part of the right midship of the Japanese "Hinode Maru" was damaged a long time ago, and was not caused by the present case. He states that the misjudgment was astonishing. Upon investigation, Mr. Jin's inspection was only five days after the incident. It is not difficult to tell at a glance that it was a new wound. If the surveyor had falsely claimed that the old wounds were new wounds, Consul Tanaka should have immediately declared it at the time and requested an assessment. Since there was no such statement at the time, it is sufficient to show that Mr. Jin determined that the wound on the midship of the right side of the Japanese warship must be a long time ago, which is reality. (4) He states that the claim of whether the "Wanxin" reversed is questionable, and that the statements of other parties involved are mostly misunderstandings of the facts of the case and are not sufficient to be used as evidence. He also claims that the ship "Wanxin" had no reason to enter the bay, but unexpectedly entered improperly, causing the accident. Upon investigation, cases rely on evidence. The statements of all parties involved in this case are consistent, which is sufficient to become an ironclad case. The captain of the warship simply denied everything and claimed that it was a misunderstanding and insufficient to be used as evidence. The argument is particularly unfair. It also said before that the ship had no reason to enter the bay, but unexpectedly entered improperly, and then said that it was a common thing according to shipping conventions, which seems contradictory. (5) He states that Mr. Jin's report that the Japanese warship could not stop the machinery in a place where the water flow is rapid more than 20 zhang away is a misunderstanding, and he exposes his ignorance. Upon investigation, Mr. Jin reported that the Japanese warship could not stop the machinery in a place where the water flow is rapid more than 20 zhang away, which was actually to refute Consul Tanaka's claim that the naval vessel stopped the machinery and waited. It was not that the Japanese warship stopped the machinery at that place. The misunderstanding is actually not the fault of Mr. Jin. (6) He states that at the time of the collision, the "Wanxin" had a fast speed, and it was not pushed by the water flow, and it was able to reach the bridge before the "Hinode Maru." Upon investigation, the "Wanxin" was going up the river and suddenly encountered the Japanese warship rushing across. At that time, it sounded its whistle and retreated, which is an undeniable fact. Also, after being hit, the water flow pressed and rushed, which is also true. Because it was not pushed by the water flow, it went to the shore, and it would not have resulted in sinking. After being damaged, it was in great danger. If it was not driven urgently, the lives of the entire ship would not be guaranteed. Therefore, the Japanese warship reached the bridge first.</p>
<p>Now, the last two points of the letter are refuted in detail: (1) The "Wanxin" avoided the usual upstream route and even entered the inner side of the naval pier. Upon investigation, the route taken by the "Wanxin" was directly to the Xianghekou. At that time, the reason why it entered the naval pier was that it was hit by the Japanese warship and pushed by the water flow. In order to protect the lives of the entire ship, it had to do so. If it had avoided the usual route for no reason and sailed into the naval pier, not only would it not have been allowed by the naval authorities, but the entire ship's passengers would have been criticized for stopping before reaching their destination, which is obvious. (2) The "Wanxin" captain's error in steering to avoid the collision caused him to overtake the "Hinode Maru," which had already stopped its engine. Upon investigation, when the "Wanxin" sailed to the river surface of the Japanese concession, the Japanese warship rushed across. The captain of the ship sounded its whistle, stopped the engine, and retreated. His method of avoidance was without error. To say that he overtook the "Hinode Maru," which had already stopped its engine, is completely inconsistent with the facts and is also unreasonable. Knowing that the Japanese warship was an iron warship, how could he use an egg to hit a stone and bring about his own demise?</p>
<p>In conclusion, the "Wanxin" was sunk due to no fault of its own, and its chief mate, Dong Changsheng, was also wrongfully detained for a week. The extent of the losses is unspeakable. The government negotiated based on reason last time, hoping to calm things down and bring them to an early conclusion. However, the reply denies everything and instead demands that we acknowledge the conditions previously proposed, which is unreasonable and unfair. In addition to sending Director Li Boren to negotiate further, and consulting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the record, we hereby respond with a rebuttal based on reason. Please review the previous letter regarding compensation for losses and we hope to hear back. (November 25th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Manchurian and Mongolian Railway Policy</h3>
<p>Japanese Admit They Have Entered an Era of Suffering</p>
<p>Criticizing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Lacking Thorough Countermeasures</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Japan's ambition to invade Manchuria and Mongolia is obvious and well known to all Chinese people. Recently, the Japanese newspaper "Fengtian Daily News" published an article by a Japanese named Takeuchisei, titled "Our Country's Manchurian and Mongolian Policy Has Fallen into a Head-on Crisis," which is tantamount to revealing its true colors. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Since the Chinese side built the Datong Line in the fourteenth year of Taisho, our country's (referring to Japan) Manchurian and Mongolian policy has undergone a change and entered an era of suffering. Later, the former president of the South Manchuria Railway, Yamamoto, made a false agreement with Zhang Zuolin for five new Manchurian and Mongolian railways, and the establishment of the Great Liang Railway agreement by Chairman Ji, which temporarily eased the frown. However, the sudden death of Zhang Zuolin in the June 4th Incident in the third year of Showa further deteriorated the situation. Recently, the Chinese side has completely disregarded our country's vested rights and protests under the treaty, and built railways to compete with the South Manchuria Railway. Because of the extension of the diplomatic power of the National Government to the three eastern provinces, coupled with Zhang Xueliang's avoidance policy, local solutions have become difficult, and the South Manchuria Railway's era of monopoly over the Manchurian and Mongolian railways has been obviously shaken. However, with the sharp decline in the world's silver price this spring, the South Manchuria Railway, which uses the gold standard, is under a major threat in the competition for freight transportation compared to the Chinese railways, which use the silver standard. Moreover, the long-feared formidable enemy of Dalian Port, namely the construction of Huludao Port, actually started construction in July of this year. The Chinese side's attitude of challenging us has become openly expressed, and it is also the vanguard of the emergence of international threats. Recently, the authorities of the four eastern provinces and the German consortium are starting to implement a large loan of 50 million yuan for the purpose of building the three major trunk lines of Manchuria and Mongolia, which is another new international threat. As such, the South Manchuria Railway policy, which is the pivot of our country's Manchurian and Mongolian policy, is now facing a crisis of internal and external flaws and is in a very difficult situation.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the South Manchuria Railway, which is the main body of the Manchurian and Mongolian policy, has experienced a large reduction in railway revenue of more than 10 million yuan in the past six months. The budget for this year is becoming more and more troublesome. At first, it was thought that the estimated reduction would be 10%, but after substantive investigation, it is feared that it will reach the difficult situation of a reduction of 70% or 80%. However, at this time, when observing the overall situation, the focus of this problem is obvious, that is, whether the construction of independent railways by the Great Chinese side will be thoroughly implemented, what will be the international situation, and the relationship between Chinese unification and the four eastern provinces. This will be the turning point to determine the expansion and contraction of our country's rights in Manchuria and Mongolia. Furthermore, to what extent can the Manchurian and Mongolian railway policy be implemented, or is it impossible? Regarding this point, it is now a major issue, and what will be of major importance to our country's Manchurian and Mongolian railway policy in the future? (1) The Chinese side is currently resolutely taking intentional resistance actions against our country. (A) The Qiyao, Tao'ang, Siping-Tao'ang, Datong, and Beining railways. (B) The direct connection of the two major Chinese trunk lines, the Jihai, Shenhai, and Beining railways. (2) Whether the three major trunk lines stipulated in the loan of 50 million yuan allowed by the German consortium mentioned above will be built, and how the two major Chinese trunk line railways will be directly connected.</p>
<p>The Japanese side believes that the most deeply concerned matter is when the Shenhai Road on the Chinese side was completed. When the railway was to be connected with the Beining Railway, the South Manchuria Railway on the Japanese side resolutely rejected its connection with the reason of six points, because it had major relations. However, the Chinese side recently took advantage of the weakness of the Japanese side and implemented it with only a unilateral notification to the South Manchuria Railway. The direct connection of freight between the Tao'ang, Siping-Tao'ang, Datong, and Beining railways has been realized. The direct connection of the Jihai, Shenhai, and Beining railways was also implemented on October 10th. At present, direct transportation of passengers has started twice a day, and there is also a form of direct transportation of goods. As for the loan from Germany, (1) the construction of the Tongliao-Taonan line via Qiqihar to Daheihe line, (2) the construction of the line from Jilin via Yilan, Fujin, Tongjiang to Suiyuan line, (3) The construction of the line from Huludao via Linghe to Kulun in Outer Mongolia are the three major trunk lines. Whether they will be built will not only have a great impact on the Manchurian and Mongolian policy, but also has completed the railway trunk line surrounding the South Manchuria Railway, which will inevitably have a profound impact on the South Manchuria Railway.</p>
<p>The above two matters not only cause a fatal blow to the railway policy that forms the cornerstone of the Manchurian and Mongolian policy, but also become a major issue concerning the interests and prestige of the South Manchuria Railway and our country. Recently, discerning people's nerves have been stimulated by this, and they feel that the South Manchuria Railway is very different from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is indecisive. Why don't they thoroughly study countermeasures? It is a matter of even greater concern." (21st)</p>
<h3>Anniversary Commemoration of the Defense Against Russia in Heilongjiang Province</h3>
<p>Unveiling Ceremony Held for the Tombstones of Fallen Soldiers</p>
<p>The 17th Brigade Stationed in the Province Holds a Public Memorial Service at the Martyrs' Shrine</p>
<p>The Family of Han Guangdi Receives an Additional 30,000 Yuan in Compensation</p>
<p>Heilongjiang Dispatch: Last year, during the Northeast's defense against Russia, the soldiers of the 15th and 17th brigades fought and defended in Zhalainuo'er and Manchuria, etc. Eventually, due to exhaustion of ammunition and lack of reinforcements, Zhalainuo'er and Manzhouli were successively captured. The loss of Zhalainuo'er was particularly tragic, with the commander of the 17th Brigade, Han Guangdi, the regimental commanders Lin Xuanqing and Zhang Xiaoying, and dozens of other officers and men perishing in the battle. The Northeast authorities have already had the deceased generals and soldiers enshrined in</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>the provincial shrine to commend their loyalty and valor. As for the remains of all officers and soldiers, the government built public cemeteries in Zhalainuo'er and Manzhouli this spring, buried them separately, and erected steles to commemorate them permanently and show them to the country. After the completion of the work, the Commander of the Hulunbuir Garrison, Su Bingwen, submitted a report to Commander Wan, who decided to hold the unveiling ceremony of the tombstone on November 17th of this year, the anniversary of the defense against Russia. Yesterday, the 17th, was the date for the unveiling ceremony. Mr. Su invited people from all walks of life in the Northeast to participate in the ceremony in advance, and also held a memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the 15th and 17th brigades who died in the defense against Russia. On this day, the Railway Bureau specially opened two special trains between Zhalainuo'er, Manzhouli, and Hailar to transport participants. Various Northeast organizations and institutions also sent personnel to participate. The ceremony was quite grand. Commander Wan specially sent the Chief of the Police Department, Jing Fang, and the Councilor, Du Hongnian, as representatives of the military and political departments, and carried two copies of Commander Wan's memorial text, which were read temporarily. One was a memorial text for the martyrs of the Lubin battlefield, and the other was a memorial text for the martyrs of the Zhalainuo'er battlefield. When the ceremony was held, the atmosphere was extremely solemn. The number of participants was very large. The local merchants and people, and the soldiers who participated in the war, were particularly saddened and indignant. Furthermore, the commander of the 17th Brigade of the Northeast Army Infantry stationed in the province, Yu Zhaolin, personally led all the officers of the brigade, as well as soldiers from various regiments and companies in the province (representatives from the 14th and 6th Regiments of the outer defense also participated in the memorial service), to the Martyrs' Shrine in Longsha Park to publicly commemorate the fallen soldiers who died in the defense against Russia. The atmosphere was solemn, and eulogies and memorial texts were written, with extremely tragic words and meanings.</p>
<p>Moreover, after the commander of the 17th Brigade of Heilongjiang, Han Guangdi, loyally died in the battle, the Northeast Political Affairs Committee had already investigated and compensated the case. Now, according to Han's wife, Ji Jufang, the family is in difficulty, and the children are orphans. All the original compensation fees can only make ends meet, and the public funds for burial have not yet been settled. She requested that a way be found. The committee then gave another 30,000 yuan. It is said that the funeral expenses are shared by Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Harbin, with Liaoning and Heilongjiang each paying 10,000 yuan, Jilin 7,000 yuan, and Harbin Special Region 3,000 yuan, and they have already been distributed separately.

<h3>The Four-Route Vehicle Clearing Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>Agreed on the General Outline of the Clearing</p>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: The Four-Route Vehicle Clearing Conference of Jinpu, Jiaoji, Longhai, and Pinghan Railways, which has been recorded in yesterday's letter, was held on the 24th for the closing ceremony. The focus of the discussions was on the Jinpu and Longhai railways. The agreement on the methods for clearing vehicles on these two railways states: "From 0:00 on February 23rd of this year to 24:00 on November 15th, according to the tonnage, car number, railway distinction, etc., listed in the signed vouchers and account books of both parties, the original locomotives and vehicles of each railway during the period shall be jointly checked and cleared by personnel from both railways, and the surplus shall be calculated and returned separately. The handling situation shall be reported to the ministry for record."</p>
<p>However, the Jinpu Railway representative made two statements regarding this case: (1) If any problems occur in the above-mentioned methods, personnel from Jinpu and Longhai should be sent to jointly investigate and clarify them. The number of vehicles originally owned by each railway from 0:00 on February 23rd and the number of vehicles owned by each railway as of 24:00 on November 15th shall be used as references for the exchange. (2) The above resolution, which includes the phrase "the number of vehicles originally owned by each railway from 0:00 on February 23rd," shall not apply to the locomotives and vehicles transported by Jinpu Railway across the border during the military transportation of Commander He to defeat Feng Shi, and the locomotives and vehicles taken across the border by Shi Yousan. All the locomotives and vehicles transported across the border still belong to the Jinpu Railway.</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway representative also made an equivalent statement: "The Longhai Railway solemnly declares and requests to reserve the statement to the Jinpu Railway representative. This statement of reservation is only the opinion of the Jinpu Railway. This opinion, Jinpu Railway has orally stated that the resolution on the clearing of vehicles between Jinpu and Longhai Railways, which was resolved from 0:00 on February 23rd of this year to 24:00 on November 15th, according to the signed vouchers and account books of both parties, listing tonnage, number, car number, railway distinction, etc., is absolutely not involved, in order to comply with the Ministry's order to clear accounts from February 23rd, 19th year.</p>
<p>In short, the point of contention between the Jinpu and Longhai Railways lies in this. The two railways will send personnel to Xuzhou to calculate the accounts together. The Jiaoji and Pinghan railways will also follow this rule. However, the Jiaoji and Jinpu railways are directly related, and the accounts will be calculated together in Jinan after the meeting. The Pinghan and Longhai railways are directly related, and the accounts will be calculated together in Zhengzhou after the meeting.</p>
<p>With the general outline determined, the conference held a closing ceremony on the morning of the 24th. The representatives of the Ministry of Railways, the representatives of various railways, and Qian Zongze, etc., all gave speeches. Today (25th), the representatives of the Ministry of Railways, Xu Fuyin, Li Yue, Tang Dehua, etc., all returned to Beijing to report to the ministry. The representatives of various railways also left Xuzhou and returned to their respective railways to report. It is understood that during this four-route conference, Longhai's opinion advocated clearing accounts only for the military transportation period this time, without counting old debts. Jinpu's opinion was that there were many vehicles lost in the past, and the accounts should be cleared and the vehicles returned from the beginning. According to the result of mutual calculation by Longhai during the military transportation period, Jinpu still owed Longhai vehicles. According to Jinpu Railway's statistics, it still needs to claim ten locomotives and twenty trains of vehicles from Longhai. (25th)</p>
<h3>The Great Fire in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Losses Amount to Approximately 400,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Two Firefighters Injured</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: At 10:50 pm on the 24th, a fire broke out in front of the Tongchunfang Haierxiang Elementary School in this city, causing a major fire. It was not extinguished until after 1:00 am on the 25th. This area is full of well-established shops, so although 40 buildings were burned down, including 27 shops, the losses have already exceeded 400,000 yuan. The responsible Fifth Precinct of the Second District has already submitted a report to the Provincial Public Security Bureau for record, including the cause of the fire and the situation of the fire, the names of the affected shops and the estimated losses. When the fire broke out, the Chishuntai Shoe Store in Tongchunfang took the opportunity to set fire. The same is true for the Tongchang Hardware Store where the fire began. The owners of both stores have been summoned for questioning. The situation at the time is recorded below:</p>
<p>At nearly 11 o'clock on the night of the 24th, there was still business in the area, and various teahouses were still telling stories. The Tongchang Hardware Store in Haierxiang suddenly caught fire. At the same time, the Chishuntai Shoe Store in Tongchunfang also caught fire. After about a quarter of an hour, the fire brigade and various charitable firefighting teams had arrived. At this time, electricity was falling like rain, making it difficult for rescuers to get close. A firefighter from the Second Squad of the Fire Brigade, Li Baixi from Hunan, was electrocuted and fell when he used iron pliers to demolish the house at the Fuxingyuan Teahouse, and his injuries were very serious. At the same time, a firefighter from the Qinghe Charitable Firefighting Team, A Long, was also injured in a fall, but his injuries were minor. The fire was extinguished after 1:00 am on the morning of the 25th. The owner of the Tongchang Hardware Store, Chen Baoxing, where the fire started, and the owner of the Chishuntai Shoe Store, Chi Agui, who took the opportunity to set fire, were both detained by the responsible Fifth Precinct of the Second District. A donkey from the Luyixing Tofu Store ran out when it saw the fire and was tripped by a power line in Haierxiang, causing it to be electrocuted and die.</p>
<p>In total, seven buildings in Tongchunfang were burned down, including four shops; sixteen buildings in Haierxiang were burned down, including ten shops; seventeen buildings in front of the elementary school were burned down, including thirteen shops. From Xinhua Hotel in the east, Zhang Tongtai Pharmacy in the south, Huanlezhai Candy Store in the west, to Chengtai Shaoxing Hotel in the north, a total of 40 door numbers were burned down, including 27 shops, with losses of more than 400,000 yuan, which can be said to be a great disaster. As for the affected households, they were Fuyu Grocery Store, Tongchang Hardware Store, Xinchang Meat Store, Fuxingyuan Teahouse, Yuanxingxiang Mill, Shunchangzhai Pastry Store, Shan Nan'an Hotel, Mingyan Barber Shop, Zhang Qingtai Grocery Store, Luyixing Tofu Store in Haierxiang; Shengchang Meat Store, Yichang Mutton Store, Liu Juchun Tofu Store, Dayouheng Preserved Meat Store, He Shuntai Tofu Store, Yuanmao Meat Store, Wanlong Egg Store, Guangren Pickles, Houchang Tobacco Store, Xiexing Mutton Store, Pan Shuntai Cooper Shop, Sun Juxing Foil Shop in front of the elementary school; Yongchun Soy Sauce Duck Shop, Ruital Cloth Shop, Yuantai Pickles, Wanxiang Dried Goods Shop in Tongchunfang. In addition, the Yi Yuan Pawnshop and Zhou Defeng Tea and Paint Shop in Tangqi were affected by a fire left by a Shaoxing fisherman who was cooking late at night around 10 p.m. on the 25th. The fire was extinguished through the efforts of the charitable fire brigades and the Bangpu water truck of the Chongyu Silk Factory. One thousand boxes of white chrysanthemums and other goods stored in the shop were burned to the ground, with losses of more than 100,000 yuan. At the time, the patrol team of the Public Security Bureau and the security regiment arrived to suppress the fire, and no accidents occurred. Afterwards, the shop manager and the Shaoxing fisherman were taken to the bureau for questioning.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Director Zhu Leaves Songjiang for Huaiyin: Zhu Huanbo, the director of the local Public Security Bureau, has served for half a year, rectifying the police affairs and making unremitting efforts, with remarkable achievements. He was previously ordered by the province to be transferred to Huaiyin. Local people telegraphed the province to retain him, but the result was unsuccessful. The newly appointed Director Shen has come to Songjiang to take over the affairs yesterday. In recent days, various legal entities such as the County Chamber of Commerce and the District Office have held public banquets to see Zhu off, because of their close relationship with him.

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The granary association purchased 70,000 shi of grain. The Wu County Granary Association continues to handle the "stabilized price grain" as before. Having sold two-thirds of the stored grain, only a little over 30,000 shi remain. Therefore, they plan to purchase grain to fill the granaries and have dispatched a special representative to Wuxi to purchase 70,000 shi of new grain. At five yuan per shi, the total cost is 350,000 yuan. This will be covered by 231,000 yuan in existing funds in the granary, 68,000 yuan in famine relief funds, and the remaining shortage will be made up from the land rent revenue of the 19th year [of the Republic].</p>
<p>The construction of Xuanmiao Temple faces new problems. The issue of demolition versus preservation of Suzhou's Xuanmiao Temple has been debated by the "preservation of antiquity" and "preservation of commerce" factions for half a year. The Executive Yuan, based on the plans proposed by the Jiangsu Construction Bureau, has already begun demolition, which can be considered to be nearing its conclusion. After the screen wall is demolished, over a hundred commercial buildings are planned to be built on the site to house various businesses. However, because the land is public property, a major question is whether the construction and rent collection should be managed by the abbot of Xuanmiao Temple or by the merchants themselves. Now, a local resident, Wang Zhaojie, has specifically petitioned the county government, stating that after the Executive Yuan's demolition order, unscrupulous merchants and evil Taoists have been active, organizing real estate companies and manipulating real estate prices, causing panic among small and medium-sized tenants and turning it into a tool for private enrichment. He requests that, following the precedent of the preservation of the Baosheng Temple in Jiaozhi, a Xuanmiao Temple Construction Committee be organized within the shortest possible time to prevent manipulation, or that the matter be submitted to the County Administrative Council for public decision.</p>
<p>The burden of grain transport is generally reduced by five percent.

<p>Measures to prevent refugees from moving south. The heads of various autonomous regions in Wu County report that refugees are constantly moving south. Although the provincial authorities have explicitly ordered a halt, refugees from Suzhou, Songjiang, Changzhou, and Taicang counties continue to wander around, disturbing the people. Therefore, specific measures have been drafted and submitted to the county government for forwarding to the provincial authorities for circulation to all counties for compliance. The measures are: (1) If refugees arrive, regardless of the number, the township head will report to the district office and escort them to the city to await deportation back to their place of origin. (2) The county government of the original place of origin will restrain them from leaving again. (3) Those who resist will be punished. (4) Any looting will be punished as banditry.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>A student strike occurred in the county. The Zhoupu Town County Junior High School formerly had a normal school program to train primary school teachers. Historically, the fees for these students were only half price to provide support for impoverished students, but since Yang Binru took over as head of the Education Bureau, the precedent of charging half fees was eliminated. The students in that program were no longer able to pay after the elimination of the benefit, and repeatedly petitioned the Education Bureau, but Director Yang insisted that it must be done, so it was difficult to achieve their goals. Therefore, the students had a lot of complaints about the Education Bureau. In this semester, Feng Guozhen took office as the school principal, but his measures were inappropriate, resulting in the students beginning a strike for some reason from the day before yesterday. Although teachers and staff tried to persuade them repeatedly, it was ineffective. The Education Bureau then appointed Chen Shixian to go to persuade them, but the students' attitude was firm, stating that they were unwilling to resume classes until a practical solution was found, so they are still on strike and a solution is difficult to find.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>False accusations of fraud were presented to the county. Long Yunzhang, a member of the China National Road Association and a resident of Wuxi, had a dispute with his friend Huang Cangyu over book and newspaper expenses. The day before yesterday, he presented a complaint to the county government, accusing Huang Cangyu of three counts of illegal conduct: (1) Huang Cangyu forged official documents of the General Association and impersonated Chen Jun, the deputy director of the Book and Newspaper Department; (2) When Long Yunzhang was critically ill, Huang Cangyu took the opportunity to defraud him of money; (3) Huang Cangyu secretly suppressed subscription orders and delayed reporting them, causing subscribers to urge delivery, not only damaging the reputation of Long Yunzhang and others, but also affecting the credibility of the General Association. After receiving the complaint, the county government ordered Liang, the investigating judge, to summon both parties for interrogation yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM. Huang Cangyu denied all the charges made by Long, and his words were evasive. After the interrogation, Huang Cangyu was ordered to be detained, but after Huang repeatedly begged, he was allowed to be released on bail. Long Yunzhang was ordered to return to await further interrogation.</p>
<p>Three more people were released in the kidnapping case. In Dengjiawan and Xiaoqiaotou, two towns bordering Jingyun and Taibo in the county, five families were robbed and seven people were kidnapped by bandits last month. The bandits released Ling Ren Da and Ling Bao Xian first, while demanding a ransom of 200,000 yuan for the remaining five people. Most recently, fourteen male and female bandits were arrested in Shanghai by the Shanghai Police Department and the local water police squad leader. The kidnapped victims were hidden elsewhere. It has been learned that the bandits, seeing that the official authorities were tightening their search and that the families of the victims were late in coming to redeem them, released three more victims yesterday, ordering them to quickly return to Wuxi to raise 12,000 yuan to redeem the rest at a certain location. It is said that the relatives of the remaining two unreleased victims have already gone to Shanghai overnight to find a solution.</p>
<p>Strictly deal with the sale of inferior seeds and the forging of documents. Yuan Hanchen and Zhou Meichun, Wang Xuchu (originally named Wang Meigen), residents of Nanqiao Town in the Third District (Yangming Township), sold a large batch of inferior Japanese autumn silkworm eggs in the Sushu Bridge area of Jiangyin County and forged documents from the Sericulture Control Office of the Department of Agriculture and Mines to deceive the villagers. After the matter was exposed, Yuan and others paid 300 yuan to have someone buy back the forged documents and destroy the evidence. This was discovered by He Yushu, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, who sent technician Bao Chao to Wuxi for a secret investigation, which confirmed the facts. The main culprit was Wang Xuchu, who now operates the Hongren Silk Company in Changkang Lane on the road as a sales organization. Yuan Hanchen and Zhou Meichun were partners and provided assistance. Technician Bao reported the investigation to the province. After receiving the report, Director He considered that Wang Xuchu was selling inferior seeds, forging documents, and even daring to bribe officials to destroy evidence, which was extremely illegal. Yesterday, he specifically instructed the local county government to send police to arrest Wang Xuchu, Yuan Hanchen, Zhou Meichun, and others for strict handling. County Chief Pan has already complied with the order.</p>

<h3>Troubles Regarding Studies in Japan</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education Has Issued Instructions</p>
<p>Since Jiang Qi left his position as supervisor of students studying in Japan, Luo Yiqun, the Guangdong student affairs manager in Japan, temporarily replaced him for three months. Subsequently, the Ministry of Education appointed Wang Keren to take over. It has been eight months since he took office. Because of his many inappropriate actions in handling student affairs, the current dispute has arisen. The Ministry of Education has now appointed Liu Suichang to succeed him in this important role. However, a major case is still unresolved. Yesterday, it was heard that student affairs managers from various provinces in Japan had issued a "Letter to Fellow Students Studying in Japan." At the same time, it was learned that Wang Keren had accused the student affairs managers from various provinces in Japan at the Tokyo branch, wanting to charge them with the crime of being reactionary. The contents of the "Letter to Fellow Students Studying in Japan" are recorded below to show one aspect of the student affairs in Japan.</p>
<p>Letter from Student Affairs Managers of Various Provinces in Japan to Fellow Students Studying in Japan:</p>
<p>To our fellow students, the supervisor of students studying in Japan bears the heavy trust of the nation and serves as a role model for the students. The position is honorable and the responsibility is heavy, and he is closely related to the student affairs managers of various provinces in Japan, as they are all personnel in charge of student affairs in Japan. If the supervisor's office handles student affairs well, the student affairs offices of various provinces in Japan will follow and progress together, and all will benefit from it. Otherwise, they will bear the responsibility and be punished together. Honor and disgrace are related, so how can we sit idly by? Remembering that after Jiang Qi's corruption case was discovered, we and others had to file a complaint according to the law for the sake of the nation's reputation, to uphold justice and maintain discipline. The truth of this matter is hopefully understood. Anyone with a conscience should not blame us for meddling. Since Jiang Qi left office, the Ministry of Education appointed Wang Keren to take over this heavy responsibility. At the beginning of his tenure, all Chinese people studying in Japan hoped that he would be honest and upright, wash away past mistakes, and fulfill their earnest expectations. Unexpectedly, since taking office, he has been perfunctory in everything and concealed everything. Fellow students are nearby, and some have heard, some have seen, and some have even experienced it personally. For the sake of the future of student affairs, we and others had to submit our suspicions to the Ministry of Education. We know that unfortunately, in these troubled times, not speaking is a dereliction of duty, and speaking too much is careless. Those who do not know may think that we and others have already accused Jiang in the past, and now we are squeezing Wang out. They may think we have wild ambitions and want to do something. However, appeasement can lead to favor, and revolution can endanger oneself. Although we are foolish, how can we not know this? Moreover, being in a low position, we do not want to meddle in minor matters to show caution. However, because personal corruption has disgraced the nation, and because the supervisor's dereliction of duty has hindered student affairs, if we and others seek our own safety and remain silent, how can we face the Party and the nation, and how can we speak to our fellow students? Therefore, upholding the fearless spirit of the Premier, we eradicate corruption and follow the great principles of the National Government's political tutelage, fulfilling our duties. This heart will not die, and we will do what is right. We can be confident that there is absolutely no motive of power involved. Our fellow students, purify your minds and be fair in your hearts. Right and wrong will be judged by all. We are still afraid of rumors spreading and the truth being difficult to discern. Therefore, we are attaching the petition to the Ministry of Education. Whether you know or blame us, it is up to you.</p>
<p>Petition from Zhang Fengqian, Luo Yiqun, and Other Student Affairs Managers of Various Provinces to the Ministry of Education Regarding Matters for Inquiry:</p>
<p>We believe that student affairs in Japan are of utmost importance to the nation's cultural future. Therefore, the Ministry appointed a supervisor to take charge of this special duty. The supervisor's morality, learning, every move, the model for the students, and the reputation of the country are all tied to this. We deeply regret the past and feel deeply disturbed. Being in this situation, how can we remain silent? We are compelled to present the following points to the Ministry of Education and ask for your review and instructions to dispel public doubts and benefit student affairs:</p>
<p>(1) We have investigated that Jiang Qi, the former supervisor of students studying in Japan, was corrupt and disgraced the nation. The Ministry has already investigated and confirmed this. It has been more than half a year, but we have not seen a clear order for punishment. The public is panicked and the truth is unclear. What is the final outcome? We ask for instructions to dispel public doubts.</p>
<p>(2) Since Jiang Qi left office, the position of supervisor of students studying in Japan was temporarily filled by Yiqun for three months. The Ministry appointed Wang Keren to take over this heavy responsibility. At the beginning of his tenure, all Chinese people studying in Japan hoped that he would work hard for the public and correct past mistakes, so that the old stains could be washed away and student affairs could be rectified. However, Supervisor Wang's words and actions contradict each other, and he is perfunctory in everything. He is particularly secretive about finances. In recent years, due to the country's many troubles, tuition fees from various provinces have not been remitted on time, and the Japanese yen has soared, making it especially difficult for self-funded students to maintain their livelihoods. If no assistance is provided, then the students will not only have no means to study, but also no means to live. Therefore, the student affairs meeting on June 24 made a resolution to help struggling students. Afterwards, there was no news. Unexpectedly, on August 28, Yiqun, through an introduction from the embassy regarding the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Elementary School, went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet with Ping Shang Zhen Er, the director of cultural affairs, and talked about the recent plight of students studying in Japan. Ping Shang said that the ministry had submitted 5,000 Japanese yen to the Japan-China Society to be transferred to the supervisor's office for the purpose of helping poor students. Upon hearing this, we were shocked and thought that since there was this earmarked fund, it could be used for flexible assistance. Why had Supervisor Wang not mentioned a word about it for two months, allowing the students studying in Japan to wander and be displaced? It was not until the student affairs meeting on September 16 that we asked about this matter. Supervisor Wang said that Deng Tianming, the Jiangxi manager, had borrowed 3,000 yen, Cai Dingxun, the Hunan manager, had borrowed 1,200 yen, and the supervisor's office had used 800 yen. He claimed not to know the source of this fund, only saying that it was borrowed from the Japan-China Society. Finally, he said that the supervisor's office had also submitted 2,000 Japanese yen for assistance. However, this matter was unheard of. Moreover, he used Jiang Qi's old tricks. The next day, in the afternoon, he brought Zhang Menglin, the director of student affairs, and the day before yesterday, Lianyi Trading Company, Commercial Press, and Da Lande went to the Ministry of Cultural Affairs to ask us to confront him face to face. After we arrived at the ministry, Ping Shang repeatedly asked for understanding and said, "This fund was entrusted by several ministries to the Japan-China Society to be transferred to the supervisor's office to handle everything, considering the difficult situation of students studying in Japan. Although this fund has not been formally disbursed, when the loan period expires and no one returns it, it will be allocated again." His words were tactful, but his intentions were the same. After we questioned him, Ping Shang could not justify himself. It was a messy account that still left people unaware of the truth. As a high-ranking official appointed by the government, how could he confront a subordinate in front of foreigners? It was extremely shameful. At that time, we repeatedly told him this in Chinese, but Supervisor Wang lowered his head and said nothing, feeling deeply guilty. We believe that helping students should be done in a righteous and open manner. Why did Supervisor Wang keep it secret? We suspect that there may be something he cannot tell people. Has the Ministry approved and ordered the borrowing of foreign funds to assist students? We ask for instructions to dispel public doubts.</p>
<p>(3) At the student affairs meeting on September 30, Supervisor Wang suddenly claimed that he had used 5,000 Japanese yen of public funds, which had been approved by the Ministry, to help poor students. Regardless of whether he initially said 2,000 yen and then 5,000 yen, his words contradicted each other. Since there was this earmarked fund, why had the legally required student affairs meeting not discussed the method of disbursement? Moreover, after two months, not only had the managers not heard of any students benefiting, but he had also taken 800 yen from the relief fund provided by the Japanese side for other purposes. The inside story of this matter still leaves people clueless. Has this relief fund been approved and how has it been distributed? We ask for instructions to dispel public doubts.</p>
<p>(4) Openness in finances has long been mandated. Following Jiang Qi's mistakes, it is especially important to be open and honest to show integrity and correct bad policies. However, since Supervisor Wang took office, more than half a year has passed, and he has not followed the National Government's order (Directive No. 370) to implement financial transparency. Although we have questioned him, he has evasively said that it is inconvenient in many ways. We do not know what is inconvenient and whether there is a need to comply with government laws and regulations. We ask for instructions to dispel public doubts.</p>
<p>(5) Since Supervisor Wang took office, his frugality in handling affairs has been commendable. Although expenses have increased to 2,000 Japanese yen per month (according to Wang himself), he has still made every effort to reduce staff and cut costs. Recently, we heard that Dai Yuanyou, the director of general affairs, has changed his name to Liangmo and has been arranged to receive a Central Boxer Indemnity scholarship. Regardless of whether his staff reduction and cost-cutting measures are for public or private purposes, does a government official have the qualifications to receive a Boxer Indemnity scholarship concurrently? Are students who have not formally studied in a school eligible to receive a Boxer Indemnity scholarship? Is there a special purpose for changing his name? Have all these matters been submitted to the Ministry for approval? Why is this different from the previous case where Jin Muyin, a former staff member, was not allowed to receive a Boxer Indemnity scholarship concurrently? We ask for instructions to dispel public doubts.</p>
<p>(6) In addition to Dai Liangmo being arranged to receive a Central Boxer Indemnity scholarship, two other names have been added to the list: Fu Shisi, a preparatory student at the Tokyo Women's Medical College, and Han Jingyuan, an auditor at Waseda University. These students have shallow academic qualifications and, according to the regulations, should not be arranged to receive scholarships out of order. What is the basis for Supervisor Wang's exceptional treatment? What is the reason? Has this matter been submitted to the Ministry for approval? We ask for instructions to dispel public doubts.</p>
<p>The above six points are all questions. We believe that managing students should be based on fairness and integrity. If one engages in private gain and fraud and keeps things secret, not only will the credibility of the organization be lost, but it will also bring shame to the nation. We managers are eager to serve the country and dare to submit this petition, hoping that the Ministry will review it, give instructions promptly to dispel public doubts and benefit student affairs. (Remainder omitted)</p>
<p>Ministry of Education's Instructions:</p>
<p>According to the petition submitted by Zhang Fengqian and other student affairs managers of students studying in Japan, requesting instructions from the Ministry regarding six matters related to student affairs in Japan, except for the Jiang case, which the Ministry is currently investigating in detail, Dai Yuanyou has been ordered to be dismissed from his position and his Boxer Indemnity scholarship has been revoked. Han Jingyuan's qualifications for being selected for a Central Boxer Indemnity scholarship were originally unqualified. Because the case had been determined earlier, it was temporarily approved. After further investigation, it was found that there were as many as 18 people who did not meet the requirements for continuing the Boxer Indemnity scholarship, so we had to handle it strictly. The student Han Jingyuan's Boxer Indemnity scholarship should be cancelled uniformly to show fairness. As for the other claims that the office has taken 5,000 Japanese yen in subsidies from the Japanese Ministry of Cultural Affairs without authorization, and that the office's finances have not been made public, we will copy the original petition and order the office to provide a clear response. This order is issued.</p>

There were 20,000 guests. Thanks to the efforts of the Loujiawan Patrol Room and the Shanghai High School Boy Scouts, the order was well maintained. The meeting was scheduled to start at 2:00 p.m. After the ceremony, the performance program began. First, the bands of the two schools and all the students circled the field for a week, which was very solemn and quiet. The welcome exercises of the two schools were neat, orderly and full of spirit. The skillful movements of Chinese gymnastics, whether single, double or multiple, were all wonderful, and the word "skillful" was extremely true to its name. The Boy Scout performance was most remarkable for its watchtower spirit, which was more than 20 feet high and was completed in a few minutes, which can be described as extremely agile and skillful. The Liangjiang games, with clear singing and graceful dancing, had the essence of floating feathers. Then, the rural dance was a full expression of pastoral life. The military exercises with lying down and firing guns, the audience was refreshed, and the final pattern also won a lot of applause. The folk dance of the male students was more than just a performance, and the guests praised it. Either accompanied by piano music or assisted by military music, they complemented each other. Yesterday afternoon, the weather was fine, like a little spring in March, and the male and female guests were extremely happy. It is heard that the track and field competitions of the two schools will be held at the track and field stadium of the Chinese Sports Association on the afternoons of the 27th and 28th, but guests will not be invited, and those who like sports are free to participate.

<h3>General Support for Xiao and Anti-Dutch Convention</h3>
<p>Over a Hundred Organizations and More Than a Thousand Representatives Attended</p>
<p>Unanimous Advocacy for Boycotting Java Company</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the Shanghai All Circles Support Xiao and Anti-Dutch Convention was held at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce in Tianhou Palace Bridge. More than a hundred organizations and over a thousand representatives attended. First, representatives from all circles elected city party representatives Li Zheng, Overseas Chinese Federation Chairman Xu Jigong, and representatives from various groups who initiated and convened the convention as the presidium. They then mutually elected Xu Jigong as the chairman of the presidium. After performing the rituals,</p>
<p>Xu Jigong reported, with Chairman Xu announcing the purpose of the meeting, briefly stating that the opinions for today's meeting are very long. Due to time constraints, he will briefly talk about the important events, which is that we have a total of three million overseas Chinese compatriots in the Dutch territories. They have suffered extreme pain, treating us like native aborigines. This is a real fact. Ms. Xiao was hired by our overseas Chinese as a teacher, but unfortunately, she was forcibly raped by the second mate of the Java Company's ship. If we promote party principles, we will also be suppressed and stopped by them. Now there is a Mr. Feng Hanyue, who was on the same ship as Ms. Xiao and knows the situation very well. We will ask him to report later. Now, let's first ask Mr. Lin Youren to report on the preparations.</p>
<p>Lin Youren reported, followed by preparatory member Lin Youren reporting on the preparations, briefly stating that on the one hand, it is very painful, and on the other hand, it is very comforting because the status of us Chinese in the international community is getting lower day by day. Looking back, foreign parks used to have signs prohibiting Chinese and dogs from entering, which shows that we were treated like dogs. But now we are not even as good as dogs, treating Chinese as the smallest ants. Therefore, whether at home or abroad, especially in the Dutch territories, they trample on us at will, without any consideration. We think, does everyone want to be ants and dogs, and not want to be human beings? So we are holding this meeting, which is really painful. But today, the people who came to the meeting are not here to dance or watch movies, but there are so many people, which shows that everyone wants to be human and does not want to be dogs or ants. As for Ms. Xiao's matter, everyone already knows. Ms. Xiao is a member of our nation. We must fight for the dignity of the nation and must provide assistance. The other overseas Chinese who were expelled and massacred by the Dutch cannot be counted. They believe that Chinese are the same as native aborigines. They treat native aborigines as slaves and cattle, and they also treat us as slaves and cattle. This kind of public insult is really unbearable. We Chinese have always been non-resistant, only knowing how to sigh and weep, and unable to resist with indignation. This time, if we do not assist Ms. Xiao, in the future, Chinese women will be in danger of being forcibly raped by them. All circles in Shanghai, many enthusiastic people, must have a kind of passionate expression. Everyone must know that the Netherlands is not that powerful. Their land is only over 12,000 square miles, and the population is not even twice that of Shanghai. If we work together, the people of Shanghai alone can defeat them. I hope everyone will fight to the end. After that, city party representative Li Zheng, lawyer Wu Mai, Shu Huizhen, Feng Hanyue, Liao Peizhi, and Luo Ciqi gave speeches one after another. The speeches were long, so they are omitted.</p>
<p>After Passing Various Proposals, Lin Youren compiled the proposals from various parties and asked the public to vote. The record is as follows: 1. Please organize a joint China Republic Support Netherlands Foreign Affairs Association from all circles. (Passed). 2.

(Passed, sent by the Nanyang British and Dutch Territories Expelled Overseas Chinese Promotion National Diplomacy Support Association). 20. The minimum requirements for resolving the Xiao case are listed as follows: (1) The Dutch government officially apologizes to our government and guarantees that the same thing will never happen again. (2) The Java Company publishes apologies to the Chinese nation and Ms. Xiao in Chinese and Western newspapers in all places in China and around the world where overseas Chinese reside, and guarantees that the same thing will never happen again. (3) Severely punish the Dutch first mate of the Chiba-Tead ship, Lan Anqi, and second mate Lei Di Ma Kai, and not dismiss or demote them. (4) Permanently dismiss the shipowner and ship doctor and not demote them to other positions. (5) Compensate Ms. Xiao for a loss of 100,000 taels. Then, the Foreign Affairs Support Association's constitution and the original text of the telegram were passed. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>Convention Telegrams (A) "Telegraph to the Central Party Department, National Government, Executive Yuan, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs to cancel the China-Netherlands Consular Treaty." To the Central Party Department, National Government, and Executive Yuan, the China-Netherlands Consular Treaty was signed during the late Qing Dynasty, humiliating the country and selling out overseas Chinese. It should have been abolished long ago. In the past, bureaucratic diplomacy repeatedly missed opportunities. Our Premier was saddened by the national crisis and concerned about the difficulties of overseas Chinese. In his deathbed will, he paid special attention to "abolishing unequal treaties." If the Premier were still alive, this treaty would have been abolished long ago. It is found that the treaty was signed on May 8th of the Xuantong Year and approved for mutual exchange on July 28th of the same year. According to the provisions of Article 17 of the treaty, it should be implemented four months after the approval of the mutual exchange, that is, from November 28th of the same year. The treaty is valid for five years. When the term is about to expire, one of the two parties must notify at least one year in advance if it wants to stop the effect of the treaty. Counting from the mutual exchange of the treaty to the present, there have been four opportunities to "notify the cessation," namely in the Republic of China years 4, 9, 14, and this year. But at the latest, it must not be later than November 28th of this year. If it passes this day, it will have to be extended for another five years. At this critical moment, we earnestly hope that you will make a decisive decision and approve the immediate order to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to immediately telegraph the Dutch side to abolish the "China-Netherlands Consular Treaty in Dutch Territories" and its annexes signed in 1911, redeem "the sale of overseas Chinese," and expand consular jurisdiction. Not only will the three million overseas Chinese compatriots in Dutch territories sing your praises, but our Premier in heaven will also smile happily. The timing is urgent and fleeting. If you approve, it will be fortunate for the Party and the country. Shanghai All Circles Support Xiao and Anti-Dutch Convention, Koutou, You. (B) Telegraph the Central Party Department, National Government, Executive Yuan, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate and amend Article 109 of the Dutch Regulations. To the Central Party Department, National Government, and Executive Yuan, the Dutch government governs the Dutch territories based on the Dutch Regulations. Article 109 of the regulations stipulates that Japanese are assimilated to Europeans, and Chinese, Africans, Arabs, Muslims, and polytheists are assimilated to native aborigines. The Dutch have special harsh laws for governing native aborigines, so Chinese are also subject to these harsh laws. If we want to solve the suffering of overseas Chinese, instead of dealing with trivial details and treating the symptoms, it is better to grasp the key and make the greatest determination to negotiate with the Dutch government to amend Article 109 of the regulations, recognizing that Chinese are equal to Japanese and Europeans. At the same time, inform the Dutch side to cancel the "China-Netherlands Consular Treaty in Dutch Territories" and its annexes signed in 1911 and re-sign an equal consular treaty, then all difficulties will be solved easily. Your government and the council care for overseas Chinese, and all overseas Chinese rely on you. We earnestly request that you order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to immediately request the Dutch government to amend Article 109 of the Dutch Regulations, the unequal provision of "Chinese being assimilated to native aborigines." We will not stop until we achieve our goal. We urgently present our case and await your orders with trepidation. Shanghai All Circles Support Xiao and Anti-Dutch Convention, Koutou, You. (C) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs, please negotiate to revoke the Dutch parliament's resolution to increase the head tax on entry." To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, the Dutch colonial parliament resolved that from 1931, the immigration head tax will be increased again to 150 guilders per person. The Overseas Chinese Federation has telegraphed three times, requesting negotiations for revocation, but there has been no effect so far. The implementation period is only thirty days away. If we do not act quickly, how can we comfort the hopes of all overseas Chinese? For this reason, we appeal to your ministry to immediately telegraph the competent consul to make efforts to achieve the goal of revoking the case. Please also negotiate the case of collecting a head tax of 75 guilders for contracted Chinese workers upon entry and revoke it at the same time. If the Dutch side does not accept it, our anti-Dutch movement will not stop. In order to strive for equality between the two sides, we should ask your ministry to quickly submit it to the Executive Yuan and transfer it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and approval of the "Regulations on Collecting Head Tax on Dutch Overseas Chinese" to encourage and punish them. We are in urgent need of telegrams and await your orders with trepidation. Shanghai All Circles Support Xiao and Anti-Dutch Convention, Koutou, You. (D) "Telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the Dutch government to cancel the procedures for inspecting the passports of overseas Chinese entering the country and to automatically revoke the Provisional Passport Law." To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our overseas Chinese compatriots going to the Dutch territories have always enjoyed the same "passport exemption" treatment as Japan and Switzerland. Recently, the Dutch government has increasingly despised our China and stipulated that "Chinese entering the country will be refused to issue a residence permit if they do not hold a passport issued by their own government or its competent authority, stating that they are allowed to go to the Dutch East Indies, and the passport has been visaed by the competent Dutch consul." Obviously, our country is being treated differently from Japan and Switzerland. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not strive for it, which has disappointed the wishes of the people. Furthermore, it takes advantage of the opportunity and privately makes a provisional passport law to cater to the intentions of the Dutch, which is contrary to the purpose of our Premier's commitment to the revolution. We urgently request you to immediately revoke the provisional passport law and immediately order the competent envoys and consuls to negotiate with the Dutch government to cancel the procedures for inspecting the passports of overseas Chinese entering the country and to give them the same treatment as Japan and Switzerland. We are grateful. Shanghai All Circles Support Xiao and Anti-Dutch Convention, Koutou, You. (E) "Telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to question the reasons for stopping the boycott of Java ships." To Foreign Minister Wang in Nanjing, the Xiao case has occurred, and the whole country is indignant. The boycott of the Java movement in Xiamen is very fierce. However, the local garrison command went against public opinion and interfered arbitrarily. After our association telegraphed to question, we replied that we were handling it in accordance with your ministry's order. What is the intention? Please give a clear reply. Nanyang British and Dutch Territories Expelled Overseas Chinese Promotion National Diplomacy Support Association, Koutou, You. (F) (Omitted). (G) "Telegraph the whole country to assist the expelled overseas Chinese." To all newspapers, institutions, and compatriots in the country, our association members have personally suffered from the destruction and oppression of British and Dutch imperialism and have been expelled back to China. We mourn the decline of the nation and lament the plight of overseas Chinese compatriots. We hope that the whole country will unite to assist in order to carry out national diplomacy, overthrow imperialism, abolish unequal treaties, and relieve the suffering of overseas Chinese.

At 4 PM, Mr. and Mrs. Wu Tiecheng held a tea party at their private residence on Haige Road to welcome them. Zhang Xueming, Hu Ruoyu, Zhang Yujiu, and other leaders of various agencies attended. Yu declined due to physical fatigue. The party ended at around 5 PM. At 7 PM last night, Finance Minister Song Ziwen and his wife specially hosted a banquet at their private residence.

The French consul also attended. Northeast dignitaries attending included Gao Jiyi, Zhang Yujiu, Hu Ruoyu, Mr. and Mrs. Shen Zutong, Mr. and Mrs. Shen Nengyi, and Qian Xumi. Zhang Xueming and others arrived first after the banquet at the Song's residence. Madam Zhang also arrived and was warmly entertained by Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Xiaolin and Mr. and Mrs. Du Yuesheng. That night, there was also a famous opera performance. Yang Shaolou arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 10 PM last night and went to Du's residence. Due to fatigue from the journey, he did not perform on stage. At 10:30 PM, Madam Zhang and her party bid farewell and were personally escorted to the station by Du and others.</p>
<p>Station Arrangement Madam Zhang was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai at 8 AM yesterday due to Deputy Commander Zhang's telegram summoning her back to Beijing. Minister Song telegraphed the Railway Bureau to prepare a special train. Later, due to other social engagements, it was changed to 8 PM that night, and then to 11 PM. After receiving the news, the Railway Bureau immediately prepared a special train consisting of one flower car No. 511, one first-class sleeping car, one first-class dining car, and one luggage car and parked it on Platform No. 4 to await orders. Later, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen also happened to be returning to Beijing, so Minister Song's flower car was also added. The highest-speed connecting car, G No. 20, was used to tow it. It departed from the North Station at exactly 11 PM last night and did not stop along the way. It is expected to arrive in the capital at 6 AM this morning. The Railway Bureau specially assigned Chen Xinghan, the section chief of the two-way resident office, to preside over the affairs of the entire train, and the night shift section chiefs along the way assisted. All hospitality matters were handled by receptionist Zhou Zhangwu. The night express train departed afterward. From the gate to the special train, soldiers from the 1st Regiment of the Capital Garrison, a company of soldiers from the 27th Regiment of the 5th Division, and the 3rd Detachment of the Municipal Public Security Bureau were fully armed to guard. On the platform, there was also a military band from the Garrison Command and the Municipal Public Security Bureau to see them off. Madam Zhang's flower car was filled with dozens of flower baskets and other gifts from all circles. All the luggage was transported to the station by followers at around 11 AM yesterday and loaded into the luggage car.</p>
<p>Farewell Party Madam Zhang and others arrived at the North Station at 10:40 PM. Those who came to the station to see them off included Mayor Zhang and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Wu Tiecheng, Mr. and Mrs. Sheng En颐, Madam Tang Shaoyi, Zheng Yuxiu, Mr. and Mrs. Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Mr. and Mrs. Shen Nengyi, Qian Jiechen, Liu Yunfang, and dozens of others. At 11 PM, Song Ziwen, Song Zi'an, and Song Ziliang arrived at the station and boarded the flower car to chat with Madam Zhang briefly. With a whistle, the special train slowly moved, and the military music played in unison. Madam Zhang also leaned out the window and nodded goodbye to the farewell party, repeatedly saying that she was very grateful for the special hospitality of everyone.</p>
<p>Zhang's Trip to the North Our reporter inquired about Deputy Commander Zhang's trip to the north from a Northeast dignitary yesterday. Zhang was originally scheduled to attend the State Council meeting on the 28th and then take the Jinpu train north. Now, because he still has important matters to discuss with Chairman Jiang, he will not be able to leave until the 29th.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Reception for Mayor Zhang</h3>
<p>Tea Party at the Grand Hotel Yesterday</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Dignitaries Gathered Together</p>
<p>The Chairman and all the directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council held a reception for Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun and his wife, ministers and consuls from various countries, naval officers, and dignitaries from political, business, academic, and newspaper circles at the Grand Hotel from 4 PM to 7 PM yesterday. The tea party was held in the ballroom. Although there were no complicated formalities, the atmosphere was quite solemn, and it can be said to be a grand occasion. To the right of the entrance of the Grand Hotel, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps stood in a row. Chairman and Mrs. Macnaghten stood in the hall to welcome the guests. At four o'clock, dignitaries from all circles arrived one after another and were led to the hall by Chinese and foreign directors and staff of the Secretariat of the Council to be introduced to the Chairman for a handshake. They then entered the ballroom for tea and conversation at will. The special guest, Mayor Zhang and his wife, arrived in formal attire at around 5 PM and were received as usual. After they were seated, the Grand Hotel orchestra immediately played the Kuomintang party song, and all the dignitaries stood up solemnly in the melodious music. When the music stopped, dance music was played after a while, and tea and dance continued for a long time before ending. Mayor Zhang and his wife took their leave at around 6 PM, and the guests also left one after another.

<h3>Wenzhou Rejection of Donations Case Yesterday Again Stirred Up Waves</h3>
<p>Resolution Overturned Again</p>
<p>Department Stores Stopped Shipping to Shanghai</p>
<p>The various merchant guilds of Wenzhou, due to the Yongjia Unified Donation Bureau changing the tax collection method for foreign and domestic goods to a unified donation system, raised objections, implemented a strike of shipping and tax payment suspension, lasting for ten days. On the 25th, it was initially mediated by the Chamber of Commerce, and the tax bureau also agreed to revert to the old regulations, and the turmoil subsided. This matter was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Unexpectedly, yesterday, on the first day of the Wenzhou merchant guilds resuming tax payment and cargo transportation, just as they were reporting the loading, the tax bureau suddenly created another complication, causing the already calmed turmoil to suddenly stir up a huge and malicious wave again. Yesterday, the reporter went to various parties to inquire. According to the urgent telegrams sent from Wenzhou yesterday afternoon received by various shipping companies in this port, all stated that since the mediation and resolution of the donation rejection turmoil on the 25th, it was originally planned to load goods and resume transportation as usual today. Unexpectedly, the donation bureau overturned the case, causing the already agreed upon resolution to be completely overturned. The Wenzhou business community is extremely indignant about this. All industries have continued to reject donations and suspend transportation from today (the 27th), and the situation is dangerous, even worse than before. This matter between the two parties has gradually deteriorated, each tending towards extremes. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also received a telegram from the Wenzhou branch, vaguely stating that the donation turmoil has been overturned, and department stores have stopped again. The "Guangji" steamer was originally scheduled to sail to Shanghai on the 26th, and had already secured cargo for Shanghai, and was about to load it onto the ship. Unexpectedly, an unexpected event occurred, and the cargo was temporarily withdrawn by the customers. It had to go to Shanghai empty, temporarily buying mud and sand as ballast. The telegram was brief, not stating the unexpected change in detail, but the situation is very dangerous.</p>
<h3>The "Jingshan Maru" Collision with "Xinfeng" Case: Responsibility for the Accident</h3>
<p>Evidence is Clear, Will Request Public Judgment</p>
<p>If Not Satisfied, Will File a Maritime Lawsuit</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Xinfeng" steamer was damaged by the Japanese ship "Jingshan Maru" at Yangzhuangzi, Tanggu, Tianjin, and was brought to Shanghai for major repairs. The losses of goods and the ship's hull amounted to more than 40,000 yuan. The company negotiated with the Japanese postal service and coastal shipping company, demanding compensation, which was reported in this newspaper earlier. It is now learned that the Japanese have rejected this matter and do not admit their mistake. The information obtained is recorded below.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the Accident is Clear: Investigating the "Jingshan Maru" collision with the "Xinfeng" steamer, it was because the Japanese ship did not comply with maritime regulations, going upstream to exit the port. According to the regulations, the downstream ship entering the port should yield. At that time, the "Xinfeng" steamer was sailing into Zizhulin with the downstream tide. Because the regulations require oncoming ships to give way, it hung a green light at the bow. Unexpectedly, the "Jingshan Maru" violated navigation rules, causing the "Xinfeng" to be crushed and suffered huge losses. The shipowner, Ma Xun, feared that the Japanese would be cunning and try to evade responsibility. In addition to negotiating with the shipowner of the "Jingshan Maru" on the spot and obtaining a certificate from the Japanese admitting their mistake, he also reported to the Tianjin Customs and requested the River Shipping Department to inspect the ship, proving that the responsibility lay with the Japanese. Therefore, the "Xinfeng"'s reasons for claiming compensation are very sufficient.</p>
<p>The Japanese Refused to Compensate: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, based on the report of the shipowner, Ma Xun, and the Japanese ship captain's admission of responsibility for the collision, and totaled more than 40,000 yuan for the damaged goods and ship's hull, issued a list, and sent a letter from the company to the Tianjin branch of the Japanese Postal Service's Coastal Shipping Department, demanding compensation for the losses. After this letter was sent, it was heard yesterday that the Tianjin Japanese Postal Service had replied to Shanghai, refusing to admit the responsibility of the "Jingshan Maru" for the accident, and also refusing to pay for the damage and repair costs of the "Xinfeng" freighter. The tone of the letter seemed to shift the responsibility for the collision to the "Xinfeng," but only expressed regret for the collision of the two ships, cunningly denying compensation and not admitting their mistake.</p>
<p>This Case Will Be Submitted to Arbitration: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received the Japanese reply denying responsibility. It is heard that the steps to deal with it have been discussed. Since the responsibility for this case is clear and cannot be evaded, the Japanese shipowner has a handwritten certificate of the accident, and the Tianjin Customs and River Shipping Department have also inspected the ship and stated that the responsibility lies with the Japanese ship. Therefore, the company intends to submit the case to the Tianjin Customs for public judgment. Since the accident occurred in Tianjin, and the public witness is the Tianjin Customs and River Shipping Department, it can make the Japanese convinced and unable to use their cunning tricks again. In case of dissatisfaction with the public judgment, a maritime lawsuit will be filed.</p>
<h3>Guangdong People's Four Organizations Welcomed Chen Mingshu the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chen Had an Important Speech</p>
<p>At 4 p.m. on the 25th, the Shanghai Guangzhao Public Association, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation, the Huzhou Guild Hall, and the Zhongshan Fellow Villagers Association held a meeting at the Guangdong Business Federation to welcome Guangdong Provincial Government Chairman Chen Zhenru, Railway Minister Sun Zhesheng, and Jianghai Customs Superintendent Liu Jiwen. Hundreds of people attended the meeting. Tang Shaochuan was elected chairman and Li Zhuoying recorded the proceedings. After the ceremony, Chairman Tang delivered a welcome speech, vaguely stating that today the fellow villagers welcome Chairman Chen, welcoming his determination to build various undertakings in Guangdong, and Minister Sun and Superintendent Liu also have the goal of increasing the welfare of our people. The fellow villagers present should all stand up and pay their respects. The people of Guangdong have always possessed a spirit of creation and determination to build. The revolution also originated in Guangdong. Wherever the people of Guangdong go, they have established great public welfare and charitable undertakings. For example, Mr. Chen Bingqian, the chairman of the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation, donates huge sums of money annually in Shanghai to run the Guangdong Business Hospital, with remarkable results. The new Guangzhao Zhuang land base of more than 300 mu requires tens of thousands of yuan, and it also relies on Mr. Bingqian's strong leadership to complete this good deed. This shows that the people of Guangdong are courageous in running local public welfare undertakings. Since the revolution, the people of Guangdong have borne the heaviest burden and made the greatest sacrifices. Moreover, due to years of war, the provincial treasury's income has been mostly used for military expenses, not giving the people of Guangdong the opportunity to realize the ideals of the era of the late Premier Sun. As far as I know, for two years, the annual income of the provincial treasury reached 100 million yuan, but military expenses accounted for seven or eight tenths, so how could there be funds to seek construction? Fortunately, the war has subsided, and Chairman Chen has engaged in construction, which is truly a blessing for the people of Guangdong. Please Chairman Chen announce a thing or two about the construction of the Fozhong Railway and the Zhongshan Port plan, so that everyone can understand everything. After speaking, Chairman Chen Zhenru stood up and spoke, vaguely stating that he, Minister Sun, and Superintendent Liu are extremely grateful for the fellow villagers' organizations holding a meeting to welcome them today. As for the construction plans for Zhongshan Port and the Fozhong Railway, he and Minister Sun had already stated everything at the Apricot Blossom Building banquet with fellow villagers last night (the 24th). Now that the fellow villagers have gathered again, he should briefly state one or two things about the two plans. The construction of Zhongshan Port was initiated by Mr. Tang Shaochuan and proposed by Chen, and the recent Fourth Plenary Session approved the construction. Upon investigation, the port belongs to a sea mouth, and after measurement, the water depth is 25 feet, so even large ships can come and go. After expert research, it is considered a natural port. The port construction fee is designated to be allocated from the refunded Boxer Indemnity. The National Government has announced that the port is a free port. Some have doubted that the port is not a free port because the Customs Tax Department did not pay attention to setting up a customs office there. Later, Finance Minister Song discovered that there were smuggling and tax evasion malpractices there, so he explicitly ordered that the place was not a free port. But at this time, the National Government has ordered the Ministry of Finance to demarcate the boundary and set up a customs office within two months. This port is indeed a free port. This Zhongshan Port line is necessary for construction in terms of transportation and geographical advantages, so the construction of the railway on this line is even more urgent. It is now planned to build the Fozhong Railway, from Foshan in Guangdong to Zhongshan Port. The railway connects to the Guangzhou-Shaoguan section of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Railway, passing through Chencun, Daliang, Rongqi, Xiaolan, and Shiqi to reach Zhongshan Free Port. If funds are sufficient, a branch line from Xiaolan to Guzhen on the opposite bank of Jiangmen will also be built. The areas passed through are all known as rich areas in Guangdong Province, with rice and silk as the main products, which are exported in large quantities every year. In the future, when the railway is built, the business will be prosperous and can be guaranteed. The main line from Foshan to Zhongshan Port is about 66 miles long, and the construction cost is estimated to be more than 11.3 million yuan. The branch line from Xiaolan to Guzhen is about 7 miles long, and the construction cost is estimated to be more than 1.2 million yuan. The construction of the main and branch lines at the same time will cost about 12.57 million yuan, and it is estimated that it can be completed in at most two years. The construction plan has been formulated by the Ministry of Railways, and the Guangzhou-Shaoguan section of the Yuehan Railway has been ordered to send a team to survey and estimate. After the estimate is received, construction can be actively carried out. It is also planned to jointly organize an official-business joint venture company with merchants and the people, with the government and the merchants and the people each contributing 6.25 million yuan to achieve rapid results. Now that the war has ended, Guangdong Province has entered a period of construction. He should do his best to actively build the province to live up to the expectations of the fellow villagers. He has always had a sense of responsibility and shame, and always seeks to put things into practice. The interests of the people should be protected by law. He can announce this to the fellow villagers, alleviate the suffering of the merchants and the people, and hope that the fellow villagers will provide guidance at any time, etc. Sun Zhesheng (Minister Sun went to Nanjing for business and was represented by Counselor Liang Hancao), Zheng Yuxiu, and Chen Bingqian also gave speeches in succession. At 6 p.m., they dispersed in joy.</p>
<h3>British Economic Investigation Group</h3>
<p>Will Arrive in Shanghai at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The British Economic Investigation Group will arrive in Shanghai on November 30th on the British company's "Rawalpindi" steamer from Japan, or may arrive on the evening of the 29th, which is also uncertain. Its accommodation has been set at the Cathay Hotel. It is learned that the country's reception procedure in Shanghai is as follows: After arriving in the port, investigate the situation in Shanghai. On the afternoon of December 3rd, take a train to Beijing. On the 4th and 5th, they will be entertained by Chinese and British authorities in Beijing. Leave Beijing on the 6th, taking a train or a river boat, which has not yet been determined. On the 8th, attend a banquet at the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce, located at the Shanghai Club. On the 9th, attend a banquet hosted by the Mayor of Shanghai. On the 10th, attend a formal welcome meeting at the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau at noon. On the 11th, attend a banquet at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. On the afternoon of the 13th, attend a banquet hosted by the British Minister's representative, Inkgran. On the afternoon of the 16th, attend a welcome meeting hosted by the British Consul-General in Shanghai and the Commercial Counselor. The date of the group's stay in Shanghai is still uncertain, but it will probably last a long time, so that it can investigate the commercial situation in Shanghai in detail. After completing its official business, part of the delegation plans to continue its investigation in Shenyang and other places in Northeast China.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Publishes a Twenty-Year Almanac</h3>
<p>Rich in Content... A Must-Have Book for Families</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau of this Municipal Government, after compiling and publishing the Nineteen-Year Almanac last year, which sold far and wide, has now compiled and published the Almanac for next year (the twentieth year of the Republic of China), and handed it over to major bookstores such as the Shanghai Commercial Press and Zhonghua Book Company for distribution. The content of this almanac is even more practical and concise than the Nineteen-Year Almanac, with the amount of material doubled. All aspects of daily common sense, laws and regulations, etiquette, etc., are selectively included for the application of local people. The attached illustrations include a lunar calendar diagram, which is a unique creation, a family prosperity and decline cycle diagram, a road system diagram of Greater Shanghai, and various astronomical diagrams, all of which were not available in the Nineteen-Year Almanac. As for the white paper and exquisite printing, that goes without saying.</p>
<h3>International Silver Commission Consultant Aitzla Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Will Lend Huge Sums of Silver to China</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that after the disastrous fall in silver prices, many leaders from the industrial and financial sectors and economists gathered in Washington to organize the International Silver Commission, and elected former US Senator Cameron as the chairman, planning to restore silver prices. In March of this year, Cameron advocated lending a huge sum of silver to China, amounting to about 500 million ounces, for construction purposes. The interest rate is not high, and after forty or fifty years, it will still be returned in silver. This silver will be minted into silver coins in Shanghai, and its use will be guided by a committee composed of seven representatives from the lending country and seven representatives from China. Now, the consultant of the commission, Mr. Aitzla, has arrived in Shanghai and is discussing the matter with leaders of overseas merchants and prominent bankers in this port. According to his words to the reporter of this newspaper, this loan must first obtain the consent of other relevant countries, but if China is prepared to accept it, it is expected that other countries will not object. If it is established, it will not only alleviate China's difficulties, but also immediately increase the world's silver prices, which will increase China's purchasing power for gold-using countries. Therefore, all countries will benefit, not just the United States alone. At present, China is worried about the danger of communism. This loan is enough to provide work for millions of workers, so that they can live and work in peace, so it can also potentially eliminate the crisis of communism, which is beneficial to world peace. As for its impact on silver prices, it can be proved by facts. The ratio of world gold and silver production has not changed from before. From 1493 to 1923, 13,215,290,481 ounces of silver and 924,599,182 ounces of gold were produced, a ratio of about 31 to 1. It is estimated that of this amount, there are still 7 billion ounces of silver and 500 million ounces of gold for currency use. If all of this gold and silver were minted into coins, then according to today's US ratio, gold is 20.67 cents per ounce and silver is 1.29 and 29/100 cents per ounce. The total value of the silver coins minted will not be as large as that of the gold coins. This shows that the production of silver is not excessive. It is only because countries are melting coins that silver prices have fallen drastically. At present, the world's annual silver production is about 255 million ounces, of which the United States produces about 60 million, Canada about 20 million, and Mexico about 100 million. In total, the Americas produce about 85% of the world's production. The world's annual gold production is about 20 million ounces, half of which is produced in South Africa.</p>

<p>The military transportation has ended, and the ships requisitioned by the Communications Office have been released one after another. They will all resume sailing soon. The situation after the end of the military transportation is described in detail below.</p>
<p>Ship Rent Paid: The ship rent for the ships requisitioned by the Communications Office was originally paid up to the end of September. In October and November, more than ten ships were rented again, all from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Sanbei Steamship Company. The rent payable has been settled by Yu Qiaqing and Li Zhonggong, who went to the capital to negotiate with the Communications Office Management Office. It has now been collected and returned to Shanghai by Yu and Li. The remaining amount will be paid in full soon after the ships are released (there are still five ships).</p>
<p>Reward for Crew Members: The commercial ships requisitioned this time have made contributions to the anti-rebel army, and some have made great achievements. Now that the military affairs have come to an end, the Communications Office has submitted a report to the headquarters, vaguely stating that the crew members of the commercial ships of various companies who were assigned to military transportation worked hard to transport and increased the efficiency of military affairs, which is deeply commendable.

Now, regulations have been drafted, which have been approved by the Commander-in-Chief, as follows: Regulations for Rewarding Military Commercial Ships and Shipping Personnel, Article 1: In order to encourage military commercial ships and shipping personnel to serve diligently during the military period and increase the transportation capacity of the army, these regulations are specially formulated to reward them.

Article 3: The medals are divided into two types, A and B.

The design of the medals and licenses is attached. Article 4: Regardless of whether they are staff members or not, they must have one of the following to be eligible to open a fact and apply for a reward: A.

<h3>Ultimatum to Jardine Matheson and Nisshin Shipping Regarding Seamen's Wage Increase Demands</h3>
<p>If There Is No Sincere and Satisfactory Reply</p>
<p>Absolute Severance Measures Will Be Taken</p>
<p>The seamen have demanded wage increases from foreign ships, including Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nisshin, Zijiang, and other six companies. Now only Taikoo has agreed to increase wages. After the contract was signed, it has been implemented. However, Jardine Matheson and Nisshin have many ships on the Jianghai routes and are also trying to deal with the seamen's wage increase case trickily. However, the seamen have always been treated with imperialist high-handedness by these companies, and there is no sincerity in handling matters. Cunning deception is their usual trick. Therefore, the seamen must make them increase wages by six yuan per person per month as requested. They have repeatedly sent people to negotiate with the two companies, but there have been no results. Yesterday, the Seamen's Union also sent a letter to the two companies on behalf of the seamen. The general idea of the original letter is that Taikoo has also agreed to increase the wages of stokers and stewards, and it is hoped that the two companies will resolve the matter peacefully as soon as possible to avoid further complications. It is also said that the tricks of the May 30th Movement should not be used today. In short, the current era is very different from the past. It is hoped that they will wake up as soon as possible and give a sincere and satisfactory reply within the time limit. If they continue to delay and are cunning and do not make a definite statement, then the seamen will have no choice but to deal with it with the final method. They are hereby advised again to avoid having no room for maneuver at that time. The seamen have now decided to wait for the reply after this final warning letter is sent, and then decide on the next steps.</p>

<h3>Central National Medical Center Invites Zhang Meian to be a Founder</h3>
<p>Zhang Has Replied in Agreement</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Meian, the chief writer of the Chinese Pharmaceutical News Agency and a giant in the pharmaceutical industry, has always worked hard for the Chinese medicine movement. Last winter, he accompanied Mr. Qiu Jisheng and others as representatives of the national medical and pharmaceutical circles to petition in Beijing. He was favored by Chairman Chiang, who ordered the revocation of all laws that imprisoned Chinese medicine. Therefore, public opinion praised him greatly. This time, the central government organized the National Medical Center, explicitly advocating Chinese medicine. Its motivation was probably already budding at the time of the petition of Mr. Zhang and others, because at that time, Mr. Zhang and others had an audience with the Executive Yuan President, requesting to organize a medical center, which was quite sympathetic to the president. Later, the members of the Central Committee, Jiao Yitang and Chen Lifu, unanimously advocated and submitted a proposal to the Standing Committee, which was approved and realized. Therefore, the central National Medical Center founders, Jiao Yitang, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Guofu, Hu Hanmin, Wang Chonghui, Zhu Peide, Yi Peiji, Niu Yongjian, Chen Lifu, Chen Yu, etc., specially wrote a letter to Mr. Zhang yesterday, asking him to join the founding and jointly plan the progress. The letter is as follows: "Respectfully, the initiation of the National Medical Center was proposed by the central committee members, passed by the Standing Committee, and sent to the government. It is proposed to follow the example of the National Martial Arts Center and allocate 5,000 yuan per month as operating expenses. Later, Yitang prepared a letter to collect the founders, and more than 30 people have been obtained. On the 19th, the meeting was started and it was decided to organize a preparatory committee. After the preliminary preparation is completed, the founders' meeting will be held again at a fixed time, and the general assembly will be established. This is a general overview of the process. Our country's medicine originated four thousand years ago, and along with Bian Que and Zhang Zhongjing, it was developed in a broad and profound way. The universe has been devastated in ancient times, and it is regarded as a star of celebration. Scholars are mostly mistaken for a superficial taste, and doctors only use it as a means of making a living. Therefore, the essence of the scriptures is not suitable for depression. Now the central government proposes to set up a museum to revive and decline, not only to preserve the inherent academics, but also the survival of the nation is at stake. However, at the beginning of the creation and sending, it depends on the strength of the group. I have always been impressed by your generosity and the public's hope. I especially ask you to participate in the initiation to increase the support of the public. If you agree, please give us a reply so that we can urge you to attend the meeting in due course. Daya will take the lead, and the high and loud echoes will be sent to the unique learning of the past, and the world will be revitalized from the chronic disease. I can't wait to see you. The National Medical Center founders Jiao Yitang, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Guofu, Hu Hanmin, Wang Chonghui, Zhu Peide, Yi Peiji, Niu Yongjian, Shi Jinmo, Wang Yongbin, Peng Yangguang, Chen Yu, Chen Lifu, Zhou Zhongliang, Chen Zhaoying, Chen Dianqi, Tang Yaoqin, etc. Qi, sent on November 25th. It is heard that Mr. Zhang, in order to promote Chinese medicine, has replied in agreement and participated in the initiation.</p>
<h3>Continued Records of Disaster Relief in Liaoning</h3>
<p>Another 5,000 Sets of Cotton Clothes Transported for Distribution</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society, considering that the disaster situation in Liaoning, Suizhong, and other places is extremely severe, has specially set up two porridge factories to provide relief. Also, with the severe cold approaching and no clothes to cover the body, they will die from freezing. They specially donated 10,000 sets of cotton clothes. 4,000 sets were shipped earlier, and the rest were ordered to be rushed to completion. Now, 5,000 sets have been made, and they were specially handed over to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinming steamer the day before yesterday for free transportation to Tianjin, and then transferred to Liaoning for distribution.</p>
<h3>Wu Jingxiong Executes Lawyer Duties</h3>
<p>Wu Jingxiong, the former president of the Provisional Court, went to the United States to teach after his term of office. Now he has returned to China and is practicing law in the court areas of Suzhou and Shanghai. Mr. Wu used to live in Mingde Lane, Fuxu Road, but now he has moved to No. 121 Huaji Road, Weihaiwei Road, to set up an office, and has invited lawyers Zhang Zhirang and Yu Chengxiu to join him and cooperate. He has also invited Mr. Chen Anlai as an assistant and designated Mr. Feng Hanxian as a clerk. It is said that he has recently started working.</p>
<h3>Women's Temperance Society Emphasizes Anti-Drug Education</h3>
<p>The Women's Temperance Society sent a letter to Mr. Zhang and Mr. Zhong of the Anti-Smoking Society, which reads: "Respectful greetings to Mr. Zhi Jiang Ke Tuo: The roots of opium addiction in our country are deep and firm, and it is difficult to achieve a fundamental solution without long-term education. Therefore, although you and others have achieved remarkable results in serving the country, those who speak earnestly are met with indifference. Opium poppies bloom everywhere, and the smoking and trafficking of opium are carried out blatantly. Government offices lack sincere intentions to ban opium, and the people lack a spirit of abiding by the law. If this continues, it will only waste your efforts and the government's money. Our society believes that in order to fundamentally ban opium, we must first emphasize anti-opium education, especially for elementary school children. Therefore, we dare to be so presumptuous as to send Ms. Shi Qunying, a graduate of Beijing No. 1 Women's Normal School and the president of our society's Beijing representative office and capital branch, to seek your guidance. Ms. Shi will have full authority to suggest anti-drug teaching materials. If our suggestions are adopted, we will be extremely grateful. We hereby send this letter and wish you success."</p>
<h3>Report on the Preparation of Issuance by the Four Banks</h3>
<p>47th Time</p>
<p>The Four Banks Joint Reserve Treasury is jointly established by the Yien Yieh, Kincheng, China &amp; South Sea, and Continental banks to handle the issuance of banknotes for the China &amp; South Sea Bank. On November 22, 1920, the 47th announcement is as follows: The amount of banknotes in circulation is 33,043,352 yuan. The total amount of reserves is 33,043,352 yuan, including cash reserves of 19,826,974 yuan and 9.8 jiao, and guarantee reserves of 13,216,377 yuan and 0.02 fen.</p>
<h3>Trademark for "4711" Cologne</h3>
<p>No One Can Imitate</p>
<p>The "4711" cologne managed by the Mei Zui Shi Foreign Firm is exclusively manufactured and distributed by the German Cologne-based Ferdinand Mülhens Company, and no one can imitate it. The distillation method is handed down from ancestors, so its trademark "4711" can only be used for the cologne of that company. According to a telegram from the United States, an American merchant named Meihang Guberfu had purchased the "4711" trademark from the Enemy Property Administration during the European War to manufacture cologne. After lengthy negotiations initiated by the German "4711" company, the Supreme Court of the United States recently ruled that the plaintiff has the exclusive right to use the "4711" trademark, and the trademark rights purchased by the defendant are revoked and invalid.</p>

<h3>Jiang Weiyu Escapes Danger</h3>
<p>Claims to Have Escaped from a Bandit's Den...Using Opium and Wine as Clever Tactics</p>
<p>Another Account Says He Was Redeemed with Money...10,000 Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Jiang Weiyu, the owner of the Jiang Xiangxing butchery at 687 Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, was kidnapped at his doorstep at 6:30 PM on the 23rd of last month. The kidnappers sent a letter to Jiang's family demanding a ransom of 300,000 yuan. Jiang Weiyu's brother, Weibin, contacted the kidnappers using a "lost and found" advertisement in the newspaper, as detailed in this newspaper's issue of the 24th of this month. However, there was no further news after the hostage's brother placed the second advertisement. Until about 3:00 AM yesterday morning, Jiang Weiyu suddenly returned home and surrendered himself to the Taiyangmiao Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, claiming that he had escaped from the bandit's den. The details of his escape are recorded below. However, according to another source, Jiang's escape was actually due to his redemption with 10,000 silver dollars.</p>
<p>Conditions in the Den: Jiang Weiyu arrived at the Taiyangmiao Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau at approximately 3:10 AM yesterday morning and described his escape, saying that after being kidnapped on the evening of the 23rd, he was blindfolded with black glasses in the bandits' car, so he was unaware of the conditions outside the car. After about an hour, he was taken out of the car by two bandits and walked for about five to six minutes before arriving at a house, where he was imprisoned. The place seemed very remote, without any sound of people or horses, only the faint sound of a steam whistle could be heard. Two guards, both speaking in the local dialect, ordered him to write a letter to his family demanding a ransom of 300,000 yuan. After four or five days, the bandits moved him to a small boat, and then he returned to land.</p>
<p>Opium and Wine as Clever Tactics: Jiang claimed that there were often ten to twenty people coming and going in the bandit's den, some wearing Western suits and some speaking Mandarin. Whenever there were negotiations or conversations, the bandits would cover their heads with masks to prevent being recognized. The bandit's den provided excellent hospitality and freedom of food and drink. After two or three weeks, Jiang suddenly came up with a plan to escape. He deceitfully told the bandits that life in the den was boring and that he was counting the days, hoping to be supplied with opium and wine for entertainment. After the guards obtained approval from their superiors, they provided him with rice wine with every meal and two or three opium pills in the evening when the sun was setting and the lights were not yet on, allowing Jiang to smoke them. Jiang deliberately acted pleased, pleading for two more pills the next day, and secretly offered them to the guards. These two guards were originally addicts, and they were extremely close to Jiang because of this unexpected gift, and Jiang often used leftover wine and food to hold festivities.</p>
<p>Escaped Late at Night: After several days of this, Jiang consumed opium and wine every day, with the amount of wine being even greater than the opium. On the night before last, at dinner time, Jiang deliberately left a large amount of wine for the guards to drink wildly. Around 11:00 PM, the bandits were completely drunk and curled up on the ground. Jiang saw that the opportunity had arrived, immediately got up, walked around the room, deliberately making noise. The bandits did not get up or ask questions, so he lit a match to illuminate the room and walked outside to urinate. When he returned, the bandits were still dead drunk, only muttering unintelligible words. At this point, Jiang became bold and pushed open the door. After passing through a courtyard, he opened another door and groped in the darkness to find a small path, supporting himself against the wall as he walked straight to the fields. After crossing a small ditch, he crossed a main road. Jiang immediately ran wildly without looking back. It was already midnight at that time. After running like this for an hour, he finally saw signs of people. He caught sight of a rickshaw coming towards him and jumped into the car, ordering the driver to pull him forward. After about a quarter of an hour, he suddenly arrived at the Tiantong'an, realizing that he was far away from the bandit's den and gradually approaching home, which greatly comforted him. Around 3:00 AM, Jiang returned home safely.</p>
<p>Another Account: The above is all that Jiang Weiyu told the police station himself. However, another source said that Jiang's escape was actually due to his redemption with 10,000 silver dollars. Because the hostage's brother, Weibin, placed an advertisement agreeing to a price of 15,000 yuan, the bandits were still not satisfied and sent three more letters to the hostage's side, arranging to meet at the New World Hotel. When the time came, a well-dressed person went there. The detectives in charge of this case followed him out, took the No. 5 tram from Daxin Street, and changed cars at the West Gate to Xiaonanmen. Unfortunately, they were noticed being followed and took the opportunity to escape. Afterwards, Jiang's family prepared the money and went to redeem him, so he was released. Although it is impossible to be certain whether this account is true, judging from the extent of the negotiations between the two sides, it may not be groundless, so it is recorded here for your reference.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Kidnapping: On the 23rd of last month, Jiang Weiyu was driving his own delivery truck from the butchery to deliver goods to the distribution point on Kang Nao Tuo Road when he was kidnapped. There were five bandits in total, all armed with pistols. The truck was found on Ma Yushan Road the next morning, but Jiang was nowhere to be seen. He was presumed to be living in the bandit's den until yesterday morning, when he returned in a disheveled state. When he was kidnapped, he was wearing a green wool shirt and shorts. When he returned home yesterday, his clothes were the same as before, but he was haggard and exhausted.</p>
<h3>Zhou Changshan Escapes from Bandit's Den Wounded</h3>
<p>Kidnappers Chase and Shoot</p>
<p>Hostage Hit by Bullet, But Does Not Exit</p>
<p>Zhou Changshan, a Ningbo native, was kidnapped on the morning of the 16th of last month at Jiangwan Sports Association West Road. On the 9th of this month, the General Patrol Room of the Public Concession arrested a bandit named Wang in connection with another case, who confessed that the hostage Zhou Changshan was hidden in a thatched house on East Sports Stadium Road. Detectives and constables, led by the bandit, went to the Fifth Police Station of the Zhabei District. Director Dai led Inspector Wei and senior constables to the address for a search, but found nothing. Only two suspects, Yang Yunsheng and Xu Zhaoxiang, natives of Jiangwan, were arrested. After Director Dai interrogated the bandit Wang repeatedly, the bandit confessed that the hostage had been moved to 279 1/2 Pingliang Road, Yangshupu. Director Dai, upon receiving this information, led his officers to the address, but found no one there either. Therefore, the two suspects were handed over to the police station for further investigation. After two weeks, the hostage's whereabouts remain unknown. Around 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 25th, Gao Yinguang, Jiao Fugui, and Yuan Guanyi, third-class constables from the Third Police Station of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, were conducting a household census in the countryside when they passed by Zhangjiatang, about two li southeast of Caohejing. They saw a crowd of villagers gathered to watch something. Constables Gao and the others, not knowing what was happening, squeezed into the crowd and saw a man about 30 years old wearing a sanitary shirt and pants, barefoot and without shoes, with a gunshot wound on his right shoulder. When the officers inquired, the injured man was mentally confused and unable to speak. According to the villagers, five or six people from Qianliangmiao (in Shanghai County) were chasing the man and shot him for unknown reasons. The villagers said the chasers fled southeast. In addition to leaving one person to guard the injured man, the constables also tracked southeast for about a li, but did not see any trace of the bandits. As they were unarmed, they did not dare to pursue further and had to return to the station to report. After receiving the report, Director Liu immediately led his officers to the scene to investigate. Meanwhile, he sent Inspector Yuan and Patrol Captain Fu, along with constables, to search the southeast in different directions, all the way to the Huangpu River. However, as too much time had passed, they were unable to catch the bandits. They then ordered the constables to carry the injured man back to the station. At this time, the injured man was slightly more lucid. He identified himself as Zhou Changshan, a Ningbo native, 33 years old, a member of the Shanghai Concession Merchant Corps, residing at 27 Niuzhuang Road. He said he had been kidnapped on the morning of October 16th at Jiangwan Road and taken into a car with black glasses on, and ordered to hold a newspaper in front of his face as if he was reading, with two bandits watching him on either side, not allowing him to make a sound. The car drove for about half an hour, then transferred to a small boat, and landed in a village, where he was hidden in a secret room in the bandit's den, unable to take a step beyond it. Along the way, he wore black glasses and did not know the route. For the past forty days, he had been wearing shackles every day, and the surveillance was very strict, and the treatment was also very harsh. There were eight bandits in total, with five pistols. They had previously forced him to write a letter to his family demanding a ransom of 200,000 yuan. Apparently, his family had already paid 60,000 yuan. Recently, the bandits told him that his family had reported to the Des Voeux Road Police Station and that a large number of detectives would be coming to search soon, so the bandits were extremely panicked. This afternoon, he took the opportunity to climb over the earthen wall from the bandit's den and managed to escape. Later, the bandits noticed and chased after him. He only cared about escaping and did not distinguish the direction. After escaping for about four or five li, he was caught by the bandits, who shot at him. After being injured, he was still able to run a few steps, but then he fainted on the ground. The villagers heard the sound of gunfire and gathered together, and the bandits fled at that time. As for where the bandit's den was, he did not know. He requested to be sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment and to notify his family. Director Liu, considering the cold weather, lent Zhou Changshan clothes, shoes, and hats to wear, hired a car to send him to the Haig Road Red Cross Hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor, it was found that Zhou Changshan had a gunshot wound about two inches below his right shoulder, the bullet did not exit, and his life was in great danger. In addition to ordering senior constables to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure that he was caught and brought to justice, he also prepared a written report on the rescue of Zhou Changshan, along with a medical certificate, and submitted it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for review and action.</p>
<h3>Tragic Car Accident Involving Westerners Results in Death and Injury</h3>
<p>Peng Jieming's Life in Danger</p>
<p>Mrs. Shi's Life Also Hanging by a Thread</p>
<p>Russian Policeman Died Instantly</p>
<p>Martial Artist Escapes with Minor Injuries</p>
<p>At 2:30 AM yesterday, a tragic car accident involving Westerners occurred at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route Albert in the French Concession, resulting in death and injury. The detailed report of the incident is as follows:</p>
<p>Two Cars Collide Violently: At 2:30 AM yesterday, in the middle of the night, an Englishwoman, Mrs. Scott, was returning from a dinner party at a friend's house, driving a blue convertible car with license plate number 7498. As she drove along Route Lafayette in the French Concession and approached the intersection of Route Albert, near pole number 65 at the corner of the Chinese-French National Industrial Vocational School, just as she was about to turn the steering wheel to turn from south to west, a Russian policeman named Popov, a horse patrolman with the French General Patrol Room, was driving a yellow car with license plate number 6480 from north to south. Both cars were traveling at full speed, and there was no time to avoid each other, resulting in a violent collision.</p>
<p>Each Suffers Severe Injuries: At the time, due to the excessive force of the collision, Mrs. Scott's car was launched onto the roadside, collapsing the short wall of the industrial school, which was more than a foot thick. Fragments of glass from the car flew more than fifteen feet away. Mrs. Scott and Mr. Peng, who was riding with her, were both seriously injured. Peng's skull was fractured, and he suffered severe injuries to his face and chest. Mrs. Scott was thrown out of the car, seven or eight feet away, and fell unconscious on the sidewalk. Her arms, legs, and face were all severely injured. Russian policeman Popov was also thrown out of the car, eight feet away, and lay unconscious in a pool of blood, still tightly gripping a broken piece of the steering wheel in his hand. His internal organs were severely injured, and he was bleeding profusely.</p>
<p>Death and Injury Alike: After the accident, nearby patrol officers immediately noticed and blew their whistles for help. A Western patrol officer from the Baojian Road Police Station, who was patrolling nearby, heard the sound and rushed to the scene. They immediately used cars to first send Mr. Peng Jieming to Guangci Hospital. As of last night, he was still unconscious and in danger of death. Mrs. Scott was sent to Hongen Hospital. After being treated by doctors, she temporarily regained consciousness, but her injuries were in critical areas and her condition was also very dangerous. Popov died before reaching the door of Guangci Hospital due to his severe injuries. As for Mr. Lucas, a Russian martial artist who was in the same car with Popov, although he also fell out of the car, he woke up after a few minutes and only suffered injuries to his wrists. He was bandaged by the doctor and then discharged from the hospital.</p>
<p>Background of Each Person: Yesterday, the French police first temporarily detained both cars and notified the General Transportation Department to send personnel to the scene of the accident to survey the truth of the accident to serve as a basis for review and decision. It is reported that Mrs. Scott was originally residing in Tianjin and came to Shanghai for sightseeing last month. The car she was driving was borrowed from Mr. Kasterano, a Westerner at the Yixing Foreign Company. The car was not insured. According to Kasterano, the wrecked car is now beyond repair, and if he can sell it for 50 yuan, it will exceed his expectations, which shows the magnitude of the collision at that time. The deceased Russian policeman Popov was said to have graduated from the Russian Military Academy, was young and handsome, and was serving as a horse patrolman in the French police force, where he was quite diligent. He was only 25 years old and unmarried, and his parents were in Harbin. He resided at number 1288 Route Lafayette in Shanghai. It is believed that he was returning home in the car with friends after a night out when the accident occurred yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Small Hostage is Returned</h3>
<p>Because There Was No Milk, the Child Was Entrusted to a Friend's House</p>
<p>The Child's Origin Was Unknown, and the Friend Reported to the Police in Panic</p>
<p>All Persons Involved Were Apprehended One After Another</p>
<p>Transferred to Court Yesterday for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Gong Yuankui, the owner of Gong Yuanji Hardware Store, a native of Haimen, Zhejiang, lived with his family at 487 Pingliang Road. On the morning of the 24th of this month, at around 10:00 AM, five robbers, four of whom were armed, broke into the Gong's house and ordered them to remain silent. The robbers then drove the male and female masters and servants into one room and locked the door. Then, they ransacked the boxes and chests, looting several pieces of clothing as well as gold watches and foreign currency, but the amount was only worth more than 180 yuan. Unsatisfied with their greed, they saw Gong's beloved son, who was being breastfed by a wet nurse, and kidnapped the child as well. As they fled, they said that if they wanted the "pearl" returned to Hepu, they would have to pay 1,000 yuan to redeem him. Afterwards, Gong reported the robbery to the Yangshupu Police Station and sent a duck-tongue cap and a foreign lock left behind by one of the robbers to the police for investigation. However, Gong's son was not yet one year old, and if he were to starve to death because he was not able to find a wet nurse in a hurry, one of the robbers, named Yang Zhengtin, took the child to the house of his friend Xu Fufu at 3113 Dong Youheng Road to temporarily entrust him there. When Xu asked about the origin of the child, Yang falsely claimed that it was his son and that his wife had gone to the countryside for business, asking Xu to take care of the child for an hour. Xu's wife agreed, and Yang left. Later, Xu learned that Yang had no son and read in the newspaper about the Gong family being robbed and losing their son, so he became suspicious. He immediately reported to the Harbin Police Station, which sent detectives to the scene. Just as Yang returned to Xu's house, he was arrested and taken to the police station along with Xu. Gong Yuankui was summoned to the Harbin Police Station by Detective Lu Gensheng and other police to identify the child, confirming that it was indeed his son, and he was taken home first. The robber Yang then confessed that his accomplices were hiding in room 17 of the Wulin Hotel at 323 Shandong Road. The detectives rushed to the scene and waited until late at night, when the robbers Li Kepeng, Dai Yuwei, Li Xin, and Lu Fucai returned from outside one after another and were arrested. Under interrogation, the robber Lu confessed that the pistols they used were hidden at the home of his mother-in-law, Jiang Yu, at 897 Pingliang Road. The detectives went there overnight and searched the house, finding two pistols and more than 20 bullets. They then went to the house of a Mr. Hu at 259 Pingliang Road and confiscated a pistol, but Hu had already fled. Yesterday morning, the five robbers, including Yang Zhengtin, along with the pistols, bullets, stolen goods, gold watches, and pawn tickets, were sent to the District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin charged the robbers with kidnapping and robbery. Judge Feng questioned the master, witnesses, and defendants in turn. Since further investigation was still required, he ordered the defendants to be detained and rescheduled the trial.</p>
<h3>Extortion Under the Guise of a Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Zhou Yuquan Was Falsely Accused of Kidnapping</p>
<p>Neighbor Zou Dexin Was Arrested for Extortion</p>
<p>On the 6th of last month, a large gang of bandits arrived in Xiaoqiaotou Town, Wuxi, and in addition to looting, they kidnapped many wealthy households and demanded ransoms. Later, the parties involved learned that the bandit leader was hiding in Shanghai, so they sent Lin Yuanxiang and a Mr. Wu to Shanghai to negotiate the ransom. Lin and the others arrived in Shanghai and stayed at the Xin Su Hotel on Hubei Road. They then reached an agreement with the bandit leader to redeem the kidnapped people for 25,000 yuan. They paid 8,000 yuan in gold at the Hui Dong Hotel in the French Concession, and the remaining 15,000 yuan was scheduled to be paid at the same location on the 18th of this month. When the time came, Lin and the others went there with the money, but they did not meet anyone. Unexpectedly, on the 20th, the bandits were arrested by the French police, and the newspapers reported that the owner of the Xin Su Hotel, Zhou Yuquan (also known as A'gen), a native of Wuxi, was involved. Zhou immediately sent a letter to the newspaper to correct the report. Then, at 5:00 AM on the 22nd, Zhou was still sleeping soundly when Zou Dexin from the Lin'an Hotel at 251 Guangdong Road rushed to Xin Su and woke Zhou up, saying, "The police are going to arrest you. Because of our shared hometown ties, I came to inform you. Quickly come with me to take refuge." Zhou, suddenly hearing this, did not have time to put on his clothes and shoes and followed Zou out. They took a rickshaw to Hongfu Inn at 22 Wuhu Road, where Zou explained the situation in detail, saying, "Because one of the bandits arrested by the police last night implicated you as an accomplice, a detective named Sun Yang at my hotel talked about it, so I came to tell you. If you want to escape punishment, I can help, but it will cost at least 1,000 yuan." Later, after Zou left, Zhou secretly returned to the Xin Su and Shen Jiang (also opened by Zhou) hotels on Hankou Road to ask the employees whether any police officers had come to investigate them. They all replied no. Zhou then realized that Zou had taken the opportunity to extort money after seeing the newspaper report, but he was still worried that he might be implicated, so he went to another place to take refuge temporarily. Zou waited for a long time without hearing back and did not see any sign of Zhou, so he ordered Zhou's maid to return to Wuxi and bring Zhou's wife, Zhang, to Shanghai, telling her about the previous matter. Zhang was deceived and agreed to 1,000 yuan, agreeing to pay the money at the Lao Dingsheng Inn the night before. At this time, Zhou suddenly returned. After Zhang told him about the matter, he immediately reported it to the police station, which sent detectives to Lao Dingsheng. While the two sides were about to hand over the money, the detectives came out and arrested Zou Dexin. Yesterday, he was sent to the District Court, where Judge Zhou interrogated him and ordered the defendant to be detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Three Punches Result in Death</h3>
<p>The Cleaner Was Too Rash</p>
<p>Shen Yusheng Died Tragically</p>
<p>Shen Yusheng, a Ningbo native who was 43 years old, lived in a rural flat in Zhangjiamiao Road, Hongzhen, Zhabei. Shen's family was extremely poor, and he carried vegetables to the Hongkou market to sell every day, earning a meager profit to support his life. On the morning of the 23rd of this month, after Shen finished selling vegetables, he temporarily borrowed a bamboo basket placed there by the Public Works Department to cover his vegetable basket. Li Guijiang, a cleaner with number 13, saw this and mistakenly believed that Shen had stolen it, so he went forward and beat him, three punches all landing on his chest, causing severe injuries. Shen staggered home and fell ill, and died the day before yesterday. His wife, Shen Wang, reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered detectives to arrest the assailant Li Guijiang. Meanwhile, the body was taken to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Huaipu from the District Court and a forensic doctor arrived at the office to conduct an examination. Seated in the public position, they questioned witnesses Song Shaoyou and Luo Chunfu. According to their statements, they were vegetable vendors in the vegetable market and personally saw Li Guijiang punch Shen fiercely three times in the chest. When questioned, the defendant claimed that he had only slightly pushed Shen's lung area twice and had not punched him. The forensic doctor stated that the deceased had no external wounds and that a detailed autopsy was necessary to clarify the cause of death. Prosecutor Guo then ruled that the cause of Shen Yusheng's death was unclear and that an autopsy should be performed, and the case would be heard again next Monday morning. After the autopsy was completed, the body was handed over to Shen's wife, Shen Wang, who signed a pledge to prepare the coffin.</p>
<h3>Policeman Dresses Up as a Beggar</h3>
<p>A Policeman Disguises Himself as a Vegetable Seller from the Countryside</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaogou, Who Packaged and Transported Opium, Is Arrested</p>
<p>The Shanghai Nanshi Pujiang Water Patrol Team seized a large quantity of opium, 3,816 taels, and released it through corruption, causing a great uproar, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the person who packaged and transported the opium was Zhang Xiaogou. This person opened a small cargo business at the Wanyu Wharf in Nanshi (which specializes in receiving stolen goods), and also operated a barge business. The packaging and transportation of opium was contracted by him and his colleague Mr. Wu. Because of these illegitimate side businesses, his income was abundant and his assets were strong. Zhang was very cunning and had many hideouts, making it difficult to find him. He also had many followers, making it difficult to catch him without causing trouble. He was one of the most outstanding villains in society, so the Public Security Bureau had not been able to arrest him. At the same time, after the District Court accepted the case, it researched and concluded that Zhang Xiaogou was responsible for the packaging and transportation, so it repeatedly issued arrest warrants but failed to apprehend him. It then ordered detectives Zhang Chunsen and Xue Bingzhang to arrest him. The detectives did not spare any effort and tried various methods, but after many days, they knew that Zhang Xiaogou was extremely cunning and had great powers, and that hasty arrests would be ineffective. Therefore, in recent days, they changed their strategy. Zhang Chunsen disguised himself as a beggar, and Xue Bingzhang disguised himself as a vegetable seller from the countryside, and went to sleep on the steps of the building around 4:00 AM in the early morning to observe the situation. Zhang Xiaogou, seeing that there had been no uniformed officers wandering around in recent days, thought that he was safe, so he stayed at home the night before. When the sky began to turn white in the east, Zhang thought that it was very inconvenient during the day, so he rushed out. Unexpectedly, a beggar and a villager suddenly got up and grabbed his arms. Zhang still did not know what was happening and shouted loudly, thinking, "Where did these wretched beggars come from, daring to play tricks on me?" After the police showed their warrants, Zhang was stunned and had no choice but to surrender obediently and follow them to the station. After reporting to Prosecutor Yang, who opened the court for a preliminary hearing, he was ordered to be detained pending instructions.</p>

<h3>Declaration of 75 Labor Unions Regarding the Xin Case</h3>
<p>Representatives of the Support Association Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, seventy-five labor unions in this city issued a joint declaration regarding the Xin Dingxiang case, stating roughly: "Fellow countrymen across the nation, the French imperialists, wielding unequal treaties as their shield, invade our national sovereignty and slaughter our compatriots. One tragic incident after another is continuously manufactured. They call themselves civilized nations, yet they are as savage and unrestrained as beasts, running rampant in our Chinese territory. Especially with the Xin case, the entire country is filled with indignation and fury. We are neither their slaves, nor chickens, dogs, cattle, or horses, so why must we be slaughtered like this? Our national rights are being eroded by them like silkworms, and our people are treated worse than weeds. Anyone with a heart must feel sorrow and anger. Their staging of this Xin case tragedy further exposes their inhuman brutality. Regardless of how formidable their guns and cannons may be, we know that we have the fierce spirit of the people to engage in a desperate struggle with them. We will not rest until we achieve a fundamental and comprehensive solution. Our associations vow to be a strong backing. We hope that all fellow countrymen will rise up together, join our battle lines, and fight them to the death. We would rather be shattered jade than preserved tile. We hope everyone will rise up and plan together. This is our declaration." (The following omitted)</p>
<h3>Wu Suzhou's Appeal Rejected</h3>
<p>About to be Transferred to the Headquarters</p>
<p>Wu Suzhou, a former field reporter for the Shishi Xinbao, was investigated by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and found to be an alias of the notorious communist Hu Yu. He had participated in the Fengxian communist riot. The Special District Court, after a preliminary hearing, ruled to transfer him to the Headquarters for further investigation according to the law. Wu declared his appeal in court. The Special Court then ordered the transfer to the Higher Branch Court for review. This has been reported in this newspaper several times. It is now learned that after the Higher Branch Court accepted the appeal of the suspect, it immediately began its review. The review has now concluded, finding the appeal to be without merit. The appeal was rejected by judgment yesterday. It is expected that the police will execute the preliminary trial ruling within days and transfer Wu.</p>

<h3>Zhahua Vessel Collides with Coal Barge</h3>
<p>Zhiba Sha Caused the Accident Inadvertently</p>
<p>Coal Sinks to the Bottom of the River, People Fall into the Water</p>
<p>Zhou Baolin, a barge owner from Pudong, along with his foreman Miao Gen, were hired by Yongcheng Coal Company on the banks of the Suzhou Creek in northern Shanghai on the day before yesterday at 12:25 PM. At the Coal Industry Company wharf of Pudong, twenty-five tons of white coal were loaded, and the boat was docked on the wharf side. Four people on the boat were having lunch together, unexpectedly, the Zhiba Sha ship of the Dutch Zhahua Company entered the port and, when turning around in that river area, inadvertently collided with the barge. Instantly, the boat capsized, the bottom facing the sky, and the coal cargo was all sunk to the bottom of the river. Zhou and the other three also fell into the water, frantically calling for help. Neighboring boat owners rushed to rescue them ashore, narrowly escaping death. Afterwards, upon inspection, the barge's hull was found to have been shattered. The amount of loss is countless and will be negotiated with the company.</p>
<h3>Case of the Violent Death of a Chinese Constable's Daughter-in-Law</h3>
<p>Defendant Objects to the Examination</p>
<p>Father and Three Sons Detained Pending Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Li Zhangshi, the eldest daughter-in-law of Li Qingfu, Chinese constable No. 615 of the Gordon Road police station, suddenly died at 4:00 AM on August 28th. Her family, believing she died of acute fever, did not report it to the police station and hastily put her in a coffin and placed it at the Yangzhou Guild Hall in Zhabei. The next day, the Gordon Road police station received an external letter regarding the matter, stating that Li Zhangshi's death was not due to fever but was strangled to death by her parents-in-law, husband, and others. The police chief, considering it a homicide case, ordered detectives to transport the coffin to the autopsy room. The forensic doctor of the Special District Court, after examination, determined that it was indeed strangulation. The police then, based on the forensic doctor's report, filed a joint homicide lawsuit against Li Qingfu, his wife Li Chenshi, his eldest son Li Yulong, and his second son Li Yukun. After repeated court hearings, the defendant Li Chenshi also confessed that her daughter-in-law did not die of fever but hanged herself. Judge Wu then postponed the case and investigated all the evidence. Unexpectedly, Li Chenshi also died of illness. Therefore, it was postponed until yesterday morning before continuing the hearing. However, the police lawyer Wang Huitang again requested a postponement. The reason is that after the incident where the forensic doctor of the Special District Court and the Western doctor of the Municipal Council examined the same body and had different reports, the defendants in this case have found an excuse. Recently, the defendants' defense lawyer submitted a statement to the court, arguing that the forensic doctor's determination that Li Zhangshi's death was due to strangulation was not without error. Therefore, the police lawyer argued that the preliminary issue in this case is still the cause of the deceased's death, whether it was strangulation or suicide, and further investigation is still needed, so a further postponement is necessary. Judge Wu then immediately asked where the deceased's coffin was currently located. Lawyer Wang said that the coffin is still temporarily placed in the Yangzhou Guild Hall. Judge Wu then examined in detail a strip of murder belt submitted in the case, and ordered a postponement. Li Qingfu and his sons were remanded, awaiting further interrogation of witnesses.</p>

<h3>Woman's Divorce Case Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>Gong Wushi, a woman from Suzhou, is currently 29 years old and lives at No. 2, Lane 123, Jingxiu Road, Old West Gate. She was married to Gong Qiusheng (also known as Gong Qiulin), who runs a tofu shop, as his second wife by her parents in September of the 15th year of the Republic (1926). After the marriage, they lived together in the Wansheng Bridge shop. However, Gong Qiusheng became addicted to opium. In March of the following year, he transferred the shop to someone else, leaving only a small room behind the shop for residence. Since then, Gong has been wandering outside, neglecting the family's livelihood. The woman was forced to eat at her mother's house. In October of that year, she gave birth to a daughter. After searching everywhere, her husband was nowhere to be found. Later, the woman learned that her husband often went to the home of Gong's ex-wife's mother at No. 28, Haichao Temple Road, and that Gong Jiansheng (Gong Qiusheng's father) was also often seen there. The woman went to rely on them, but her husband never once came. Before long, she was rejected and returned to her mother's home to live temporarily. For the past three years, the woman has felt that the future is long and the future is bleak. Therefore, she hired lawyers Xue Jiaqi and Wang Zuxun to file a divorce lawsuit with the District Court, with the reason being abandonment for more than three years, which can be said to be the end of affection. The plaintiff's mother's family has many mouths to feed. In this autumn when rice is as expensive as pearls, life is difficult, and the plaintiff really has no choice but to rely on her family. She requests to be granted a divorce. The defendant Gong Qiusheng also hired lawyer Liu Xiang to file a defense and counterclaim for cohabitation. The case has been heard several times, but the defendant has not appeared in court. The case has been suspended without a conclusion. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Jinjian continued the hearing. Both parties appeared in court with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff Gong Wushi briefly stated the previous situation and said that all her clothes and ornaments have been pawned and exhausted. She requests to be granted a divorce. Next, the defendant Gong Qiusheng testified that he is 33 years old, a businessman, currently living at No. 28, Haichao Temple Road, with his ancestral home in Nanhui. There are still grandparents in his family. On September 26th of the 15th year of the Republic (1926), he remarried the plaintiff as his second wife. He then went to Nanjing to work in a lamp factory with a monthly salary of 30 yuan, bringing home 20 or 15 yuan for household expenses each month. Last year, the plaintiff returned to her mother's home. I went to pick her up, but the plaintiff refused. This time the plaintiff filed a lawsuit. I was sick in Nanjing and my father informed me in a letter. The shop I opened earlier has already closed. My broker has difficulty marrying a wife, so I cannot agree to the plaintiff's request for divorce and request the dismissal of the plaintiff's lawsuit and a judgment of cohabitation. The judge, having heard the testimony, said to the lawyers of both parties, "Is there any hope of reconciliation in this case?" Lawyer Xue said that the plaintiff currently has three conditions. If the defendant can agree, the plaintiff is willing to cohabit: (1) The plaintiff's living expenses for the past three years, which were borrowed from others, totaling 640 yuan, should be reimbursed by the defendant in full; (2) The house where they live should be rented by the defendant; (3) The defendant should pay the plaintiff 30 yuan per month for living expenses. The judge questioned the defendant, who said he was unable to bear the burden. Therefore, reconciliation was unsuccessful. He then invited Prosecutor Wu to the court to express his opinion. The judge ordered the debate to begin. The lawyers of both parties argued for a long time and determined that the debate was over, scheduling the judgment for 1:00 PM on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Woman's Divorce Case Attempted Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Xili Hanxian, a Cantonese woman, recently hired lawyer Wu Chengyu to sue her husband Xili Zhonghu in the District Court for three reasons: failure to provide living expenses, refusal to cohabit, and taking a concubine. She requested a divorce and demanded 8,000 yuan in alimony. The defendant Xili Zhonghu also hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to file a defense. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang opened the court to hear the case. The plaintiff Xili Hanxian testified that she is 29 years old, from Guangdong, and lives on Baotong Road, Zhabei. She got married on the eighth day of the third month of the 15th year of the Republic (1926). (Question) Did you know each other before the marriage? (Answer) Yes, we did. Recently, he took a concubine named Yang, abandoned me, and does not support me. That's why I'm asking for 8,000 yuan in alimony and the return of the dowry worth 1,800 yuan. The defendant Xili Zhonghu testified that he is 29 years old, from Nanhai, Guangdong, and lives on Disiwei Road. He is currently a clerk at a foreign company with a monthly salary of 50 yuan. The plaintiff does not abide by the virtues of a wife, does not care for the household on weekdays, and often goes out under various pretexts, with unknown whereabouts. I have advised her in vain. I do not want a divorce. Moreover, the wedding expenses were more than 2,000 yuan when I married her. The judge, having heard the testimony, ordered the lawyers of both parties to go out for reconciliation. If reconciliation is unsuccessful, another hearing will be scheduled to render a judgment according to the law. Then, the court adjourned.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I read in your newspaper yesterday a news item about a Guangdong man named Liang Jintang who defrauded people. The name of the Guangdong man happens to match mine, which has caused dozens of my relatives and friends to come and inquire about the truth. There must be many others who have seen the report and mistakenly thought that it involved me. I kindly ask your newspaper to use its influence and include a statement in the "Letters to the Editor" column as soon as possible, stating that the Guangdong man named Liang Jintang in the above news item is not the Guangdong man named Liang Jintang who currently lives at No. 5, Xiangjing Lane, Chuan Highway, Zhabei, so as to avoid misunderstandings. Respectfully, Liang Jintang, November 26, 1920.</p>

<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>Mother (to her daughter): Child, how can you be so rude and dare to complain about your father? You really have no respect for your elders.</p>
<p>Daughter: I'm just straightforward, that's how I've always been.</p>
<p>Mother: Look at how I treat him. I'm his equal, but I never dare to offend him.</p>

<h3>The Grand Funeral of Mr. Yuan by Ji Baoshan</h3>
<p>— Sun Chucheng</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Guanlan passed away on August 29th of this year. The sorrow and condolences from all circles have been recorded in this newspaper on November 23rd. Mr. Yuan's public funeral was held in the west of Baoshan County by various circles in Baoshan. I was a close friend of Mr. Yuan, despite the age difference. I received the notice in Shanghai the other day, but because I was on official duty in the capital and had not returned, I was unable to attend the memorial service. Therefore, on this day, I specially accompanied Mr. Huang Renzhi to Baoshan to pay our respects and fulfill our friendship. I have recorded the trivial details of what I saw below.</p>
<p>On this day, Mr. Yuan's coffin departed from Yongxi Hall of the Shaoxing Guild Hall outside the West Gate of Shanghai. It was transported by horse-drawn carriage to Qiujiang Road in Zhabei. Then, it was transferred to a motor vehicle of the China Moving Company to be transported to the Baoshan Public Sports Field. Friends and relatives from Shanghai who came to see off the funeral procession returned after reaching the train station. Those who went to Baoshan took the train to Wusong and were picked up by public buses to the south gate of Baoshan. A bright tile shed was specially built inside the sports field, and a white archway was erected high at the entrance. A square table was set up inside the shed, with incense stands and sacrificial offerings. When the coffin arrived at the field, it was moved to the center of the field and transferred to a wooden coffin. At that time, representatives from all circles in Baoshan had gathered at the field and held a public memorial service. Pu Xieying presided over the ceremony, and Wu Zigang was the master of ceremonies. The ceremony was very simple. (1) Offer incense and bow. (2) Offer wine and bow. (3) All participants bow three times. At half-past one, the procession departed from the sports field. In addition to the elephant pavilion and the inscription pavilion, there was the military band of the Hui'er Orphanage, as well as students from various schools and representatives from all circles. They all wore black gauze armbands, paper flowers on their chests, and held long incense sticks, proceeding one after another through Jiaotai Gate. There was a roadside memorial service at the intersection, presided over by Wu Shiqiao. Heading north to the Drum Tower, there was another roadside memorial service, presided over by Wang Zouyun. Turning west to the front of the county school, a white cloth banner with the four characters "门墙洒泪" [tears shed at the door of the school] was hung. Zhao Xudong led the faculty and staff in this roadside memorial service. This school was founded by Mr. Yuan himself thirty years ago. Before entering the normal school, there was another roadside memorial service. Zhu Jiaji, the principal of the school, led all the faculty and staff in the joint memorial service. Outside the West Gate, at the cemetery, behind Qin Yu Villa, a cloth awning was specially erected above the tomb. The tomb was built with terrazzo, painted red inside, and inscribed with Mr. Yuan's birth and death dates and times. A tombstone was laid below. The coffin was painted entirely in vermillion red, and there were golden characters at the head that read: "The coffin of the late Mr. Yuan, named Xitao, with the posthumous title of Hongyi, a citizen of the Republic of China." Mr. Yuan's younger brothers, Mr. Xi Lian and Mr. Xi Luo, wore white clothes and led the entire family, men and women, to surround the tomb. When the coffin was lowered into the grave, the sound of wailing was unbearable. A sacrificial altar was then set up, and friends and relatives holding the ropes surrounded the tomb once before retreating to perform the ceremony. Then the tomb was sealed. Baoshan is located in a remote coastal area. Although it is a county town, the population is not large. On this day, people came from all directions, creating a scene of ten thousand people empty alleys. Mr. Yuan's old residence, which was located inside the South Gate, was already dilapidated. When the ceremonial guard passed by, the villagers all pointed to the house, recalling the circumstances of Mr. Yuan's birth. The distance from the public sports field, around the southwest city, to the cemetery was several miles. Professor Pan Guangdan of Guanghua University, because he injured his foot jumping high while studying at Tsinghua School, had one leg amputated. He walked with wooden crutches. He also followed the funeral procession on this day. I walked alongside him, and the onlookers all pointed and laughed. Mr. Pan nodded in response. His sincerity in admiring Mr. Yuan was even greater than ours. The public funeral ended at three o'clock in the afternoon. Those who held the ropes had been working on an empty stomach without any sign of fatigue, which shows how deeply Mr. Yuan was respected and admired. We then went to the Party Headquarters for a meal. After the meal, we were led by a receptionist to the Public Education Center to see the Yuan Gong Memorial Tower. It was not yet completed. It was about two zhang (approx. 6.6 meters) high, with stone piers underneath. The material was terrazzo, covered by wooden coffins, so the inscriptions could not be seen. It was said that it would be completed next month. Then, we all took public buses to Wusong and took the train back to Shanghai. It was already late at night. I wrote this to express my sorrow.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Japanese Club's Banquet</h3>
<p>— Ma Mengrong</p>
<p>Mr. Tsuchiya Keizayuu, the president of Mitsui Bank of Japan in Shanghai, has been stationed in Shanghai for fourteen years. He is capable, humble, elegant, and has a deep friendship with the Chinese people. He is also fond of calligraphy and painting. He has spared no effort in promoting anything related to the development of Sino-Japanese art. He contributed greatly to the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Art Society. Recently, he was honorably transferred back to his country by order of the head office. The comrades of the Art Society gave him a farewell banquet at Ziyuan, and each of them created a painting, beautifully bound into a volume, as a farewell gift. Yesterday, he held a return banquet at the Japanese Club, inviting distinguished figures from all walks of life in Shanghai, old friends, and art comrades to bid farewell and introduce the new president, Mr. Hirano Sukeho. About three hundred guests attended, half Chinese and half Japanese, a lively and grand occasion. I recently caught a cold and had not been out for several days. I accepted the invitation and went to the banquet. After entering the banquet hall, Mr. Tsuchiya gave a speech first. President Hirano, Minister Chongguang, and President Zhang Gongquan of the Central Bank also gave speeches. During the banquet, geishas were invited to sing and dance to add to the festivities, which is rarely seen outside. I will record it here as a "Free Talk".</p>
<p>There were a total of five musical performances, including three Japanese-style songs and dances and two Western-style songs and dances. The first was Nagauta Kanijicho, performed by the geishas of the Rokusan Pavilion. There were ten geishas, sitting in two rows. Two of them played the "Man", which sounds like "Hulei", not plucked with fingers, but with ivory combs, sounding like Pipa. Three people beat the small drums. A man played the flute in harmony with them. The tone was harmonious and quiet, probably passed down from our country during the Tang Dynasty. The second was Buyo Tamagawa, also performed by the Rokusan geishas. There were also ten people, three playing the zither, three singing, and four dancing. However, the zither players did not sing, the singers did not dance, and the dancers did not sing either. The dance was light and elegant, like feathers gathering, like dragons swimming, with the ancient style of our country. Later, the number of dancers increased to six, each holding a piece of colored silk, spinning, turning, and flying. The five colors were dazzling, like dragons flying and phoenixes soaring, like brocade, which was quite spectacular. Later, they played Gion Kouta, depicting the autumn scenery of the suburbs. The four dancers were extremely quiet and solemn.</p>
<p>The two Western-style dances were "Yammurisk" and "Hepwahis Dance", performed by the dancers of the Qingniao Dance Hall in Hongkou. They were purely Western-style duets and solo dances. The dancers were young girls who had not yet reached adulthood. The beauty of natural curves was fully revealed. Their skin was beautiful and their bodies were light and graceful. They danced with their hands and feet, as fast as swallows, as light as startled geese, expressing everything vividly. The deep feeling of the flesh aroused applause like thunder. The sailor dance was also spectacular, surpassing the French Montmartre troupe. It was a pity that there were few melodious songs.</p>
<p>The host urged everyone to drink heartily. The geishas also went around pouring wine for the guests. Everyone drank merrily. At the end of the banquet, each person was given a box of cakes and a group photo of the comrades of the Art Society as a souvenir.</p>
<p>By this time, Mr. Yingbin was half drunk, but his excitement was still high. I invited him to go to the Tiansheng Stage to watch the famous amateur actor Zhu Yanan's "Golden Lock Record". Mr. Yingbin agreed. Then I went by car with Hongwei, Manqing, and Jiekang. When we arrived at the stage, Mr. Yingbin said that he felt drunk and had to return to the club. So the four of us went inside to watch the play. Soon, Yanan appeared on the stage. Her voice was melodious and her beauty was natural. Her singing and acting were both excellent, not much inferior to Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, and Shuang. The walls were full of couplets, plaques, calligraphy, and paintings, complementing each other. I also wrote a painting of chrysanthemums and mynahs under the moon as a gift, titled: "The beautiful color stands out as the best under the frost, the new sound is like listening in the moon", to express my admiration. After the play, I returned to my residence. It was already midnight. I could not sleep after going to bed, so I wrote this to record it.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes in Southeast Asia (84)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The Burmese have many strange customs. I will visit them more. In addition to eating with their hands, they also bathe in clothes, which we consider to be strange. The weather here is hot. We usually take a shower every day. However, in Burma, you must wear pants when you shower. If you are in a special shower room, you can be free. But if you rent a room with people, there is no special shower room. There is only a partition that is one or two feet high. You must wear pants to shower. I find it very difficult. In the past, a big storm arose in Yangon University because the Chinese teachers refused to wear pants when bathing. When entering a country, you should ask about the customs. The power of customs is greater than the law. You must be in awe. Eating with your hands and showering in pants are really strange things in our country, but they are their laws. Burmese men and women can bathe and change pants in the streets. There is a need to wear clothes when bathing. (This paragraph is not easy to explain clearly and requires a lot of incidents, so I have omitted it.) The old Master Zangjing Faxian described the customs of various parts of India. The king ate with his hands. So even the king was like this. India still keeps its customs to this day. So the Buddha also ate with his hands in the past. If those who learn from the Buddha also learn to eat with their hands? Just smile. It reminds me of the customs I got in Jin, there are two sentences: "Fire is burned under the bed, and the roof is cultivated." Those who hear it will be very strange. Try to explain it. In the northern region, the earth kang is burned in winter. Therefore, cooking is also done in the earth kang. At night, they sleep on the kang to keep warm. This is generally the case in the three northeastern provinces. The roof is cultivated by the people on the high mountain slopes, who dig holes in the earth to live in. The soil is hard, and the holes are warm in winter and cold in summer, which is also suitable for hygiene. The top of the hole is a mountain slope, and they still plant grains as usual. I am writing a world customs journal to compare customs from various places to provide research and to dispel narrow-mindedness. A friend from Jin also told me that north of Yanmen Pass, people often wear leather jackets and eat watermelon. This is because the weather is warm and the watermelon ripens after August, when the weather is already cold. So the melons ripen when they are wearing leather jackets. Now that I have come to Southeast Asia, there are only dry and wet seasons. The saying "I don't know the language of spring and autumn" is proven here.</p>
<p>The weather is most hygienic in the rainy season. Because it is slightly cool after the rain, which is about the weather in May in our country. Those who don't know think that Southeast Asia must be very hot in June and July, but in reality, it is not. It is July in the solar calendar, which is June in Shanghai. But I can wear a jacket in Burma because it is after the rain. You can't not cover yourself with a blanket at night. The rainy season is the most hygienic. The rainy season in Burma is from May to October in the solar calendar. The rainy season is the wet season. November to April is the dry season. The dry season is dry and hot, which people fear.</p>

<h3>YARN AND COTTON YARN MARKET WEAKENS AND FALLS</h3>
<p>The yarn market is very sluggish. The sales of various gangs are bleak. Japanese merchants are heavily shorting. The freezing period has arrived. There is very little hope for spot sales. Therefore, a certain manufacturer has a negative attitude. Not only does it have no intention to receive goods this month, but it also has the saying of delivering 2,000 to 3,000 packages. With this situation, the downward trend is intensifying.</p>
<p>Man-Mark Bidding Throws High Pressure. The opening of Man-Mark American cotton was weak. This month is the last day. Because the delivery is sufficient, there are fewer receivers, falling by one or two. The distant months were affected and fell. As a result, the near month fell by one or two and one cent, and the distant month fell by four or five cents. Spot sales were deserted in the afternoon, and the market atmosphere was even more sluggish. However, the last trade of this month rose by one or two due to retail short covering, and the distant month fell by 1.23 cents. The total turnover for the day was 32,400 bales.

<h3>NO TURNAROUND IN THE COTTON MARKET</h3>
<p>The cotton market is getting weaker and the situation is bleak. In fact, the world cotton market is depressed, and all factories have no procurement. Moreover, Indian cotton foreign firms are eagerly seeking a way out, and the business of native cotton has been almost completely occupied. However, the price in Hankou is still firm, and the source is still scarce, so a part of it is purchased.</p>
<p>Bleak Hankou Mark. The Hankou Mark opened in the previous market, with American cotton and people's hearts being flat. Each day fell by 5 cents to 1 cent.

<h3>FOOD AND RIVER DOWN RICE MARKET FALLING STEADILY</h3>
<p>Zhabei. Yesterday, the various gangs arrived at about 40 ships. The market sales were more sluggish than before. The best Beigeng fell outside the corner. The opening price was 14 yuan and 80 cents, and the middle and second class Geng rice were more than 20 cents. The situation is likely to plummet. The current thin rice is the weakest. The arrival is still strong, and there is no sales venue, resulting in a steady downstream trend in the market. The higher ones barely made 12 yuan and 70 cents. Yangxian's sales in all directions are particularly strong. The top goods are still 12 yuan and 40 cents, and the trend is stable. Dujian is actually lacking high-quality goods, and the ordinary ones feel strong. The buying is flat, and the price is tired at the corner. The top-quality goods in the port are rare and without honor or disgrace. The market opened at 12 yuan to the left of the pass. The guest tip market is flat. The source of Wan Ning has been extremely small recently, and the cargo owners have no intention of selling, so the price has been stable. Bianyuan, such as Zhenzhen, opened particularly high at 15 yuan and 20 cents, but the high-quality goods in the market are only between 14 yuan and 67 cents. The situation is due to the fact that the way out is still uncertain, so there is a lack of rise and fall. Yinyuan continued to be set. The market is similar to the previous day. At present, both the Geng and Xian markets are still looking soft. If it cannot be sunny for several days, it will inevitably have to fall again, so the store stomach is extremely dull.</p>
<p>Hunan. Yesterday, about 30 ships arrived in the river. The sales were deserted and there were few transactions. Changxi Gaogeng gradually turned soft, requiring a small 20 to 30 cents. Gaozu 14 yuan 22 cents, and ordinary large-market geng rice needs to fall by more than 14 cents. Su Tong Bai Geng also fell sharply at the beginning. Both high and second grades were sluggish. Until noon, the decline was slightly stable, but the highest opening was only 12 yuan and 50 cents. The falling wind of early thin rice on the southern road is even more fierce, reporting a shortage of 40 to 50 cents, and the arrival is still connected. The guest sales here are very light, and the higher ones have fallen back to 12 and a half yuan, but the top thin rice in the market is only 12 yuan at the checkpoint. Yangdu and other tips arrived and sold two enemies. The market has no rise or fall, only a few middle-level goods are allowed to be a small corner. Bianyuan Yinhua are all flat and tired, and it is not easy to turn better in this trend.</p>
<h3>SECONDARY AND GUEST YUAN HAVE A WAY TO MAKE WINE</h3>
<p>Yesterday's guest Xian market situation. The sales are still active, but the arrivals are gradually increasing. The core is still flat and soft.

<h3>A STATE OF LINGERING IN THE FLOUR MARKET</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market. After the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market conditions in each month generally showed a hovering phenomenon. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago is about 24 cents, and Canada is about 67 cents. However, the inquiry of the current wheat has been more silent in recent days. On the factory side, because the chips issued have generally exceeded the amount of production, they are not too concerned about it, and temporarily wait and see. The bulls still have little hope for the foreign environment, so they dare not start. Therefore, each trade showed a hovering, with very little rise and fall. As a result, this month and December were slightly 2.5% smaller than the previous day, January was unchanged, February was slightly 2.5% smaller, March was slightly 5%, and April was 2.5% larger.</p>
<h3>NEAR-WEAK AND FAR-FLAT WHEAT MARKET</h3>
<p>It is said that the total number of deliveries is 78 cars.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market. After the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market conditions in each month showed a phenomenon of near-weak and far-flat. Because there is only one day left for trading this month, many non-industry bulls have to take the opportunity to close out, so people's hearts are very soft. The final result was 3% lower than the previous day. As for the number of deliveries, it is said that the total number is 78 cars, all delivered by Zhonghua Factory, of which foreign wheat accounts for the majority. It is said that Shenda first pre-received 35 cars, and the rest were received by the merchants.

As a result, December and January were unchanged, February was better by 1%, March was smaller by 1%, and April was unchanged. In the spot wheat market, the whole city still has no deliveries.</p>

Jinfahao peddles spot No. 20 medium granulated white sugar at a price of 6 taels and 7 qian, because the merchants still have inventory on hand, and the sales are very dull, so the transaction could not be concluded.</p>

The end of the year is approaching in a blink of an eye. The suffering suffered by Chinese tea merchants is indescribable. Moreover, the Russian firm is said to have reached the quota for Gongxi. The future of the tea industry is of great concern.</p>
<h3>LARGE SALES OF COARSE CLOTH FOR MILITARY NEEDS IN THE PIECE GOODS MARKET</h3>
