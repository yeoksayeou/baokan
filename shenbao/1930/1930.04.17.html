<h3 id="c7">世界消息之種類 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>留心世界消息者。據各外電之報告。大抵不外三種。工業則日有進步與發明。商業則日就衰落而困頓。人類各種之爭。雖日求消弭而日益顯露。其他消息雖亦時有。而歸納以觀。此三者實爲近時世界時局之中心也。</p>
<p>因此可知。研求世界之各種事物皆易。而研求人心最難。處理世界之物質日有進步。而處理人與人間之關係。則難有進步。人口日增。人心日巧。其處理之也益形不易。研求一切物質者。日有進步。故工業發明者多而日益發達人口增。人心巧。處理人與人間之道。日見無法。是以人類之爭。隨處隨時而。起而商業之衰落。亦不能免此其間乃有互爲因果之樞。雖欲强爲挽救而末由者也。就一國而言人。皆弱而已獨强。人皆愚而已獨智。則强者智者。自可得優越之地位。國與國間之世界亦然。他國皆弱而一二國獨强。他國皆愚而一二國獨智。則强者智者。自亦處於優越之地位。今世界之人類。除技術以外之知識。漸躋於相等。而世襲而來之優越地位。尙欲固守勿失。其何能弭人類之爭。而得處理人與人間之善道乎。</p>

<h3 id="c127">湖南敎育廳長黃士衡談話 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>湖南省敎育廳長黃士衡氏、偕該省縣敎育局長代表黃篤杰氏、於十二日到京、記者與黃廳長作下列之談話、</p>
<p>一、敎育經費、</p>
<p>（子）省敎育經費、十七年度爲一八八萬餘元、十八年度加至二百六十三萬零五三二元、計增七十五萬餘元、茲將各項經費所占全敎育經費之百分數、詳述如下、（一）初等敎育經費占百分之四、（二）中等敎育經費占百分之四十、（三）高等敎育經費占百分之十三、（四）私校補助費占百分之十三强、（五）社會敎育經費占百分之二十二、（六）留學經費占百分之五、</p>
<p>省敎育行政經費、不在在省敎育經費之内、自十八年度起、由省政府每月撥給八千四百十元、全年共計約十萬零九百二十八元、</p>
<p>（丑）地方敎育經費、湖南六十九縣、計五百四十八萬四千四百五十元、湖南全省共七十六縣、有七縣報告尙未呈到、故未列入、各縣經費估計總數應有六百零三萬之多、最多者爲長沙縣、全年四十二萬元、湘潭三十八萬元、湘鄕三十萬元、最少者通道縣、僅六千元、地方敎育之百分比如下、甲、初等敎育占百分之七十一又七十、乙、中等敎育占百分之六又五十、丙、社會敎育占右分之三又四十八、丁、敎育行政經費占百分之十三又八十九、戊、其他占百分之五又零四、</p>
<p>二、關於小學敎育情形　湘省自民國十六年以前、全省敎育界中有多數共黨操縱、馬日以後、當局謀淸共及改進師資、舉行檢定小學敎師、十七年以來、省校附屬小學、已增加經費、並改良職敎員待遇、近來謀推行義務敎育、在省設省義務敎育委員會、各縣設縣義務敎育委員會、規劃義務敎育進行辦法、</p>
<p>湘潭等六十縣十七年度學校數之調查如下、（一）初級小學一萬一千九百六十七所、（二）完全小學三百二十七所、（三）高級小學二百八十二所、（四）省立附小七所（幼稚園在外）、以上共計一萬二千五百八十三所、</p>
<p>擴充小學經費、非常困難、其原因有四點（一）從前寺廟財產、可以撥充敎育經費、自内政部頒布寺廟保管條例後、已不能提充、（二）烟酒附加稅、本爲地方敎育經費之一、現因財政部取消此項捐稅、來源頓减、（三）從前各縣得自行籌欵、現在財政部監督地方財政、限　　財政部代表許守之</p>
<p>制綦嚴、難以開源、（四）各縣舊案中凡已經核准而撥充敎育經費者、財政機關、常認爲苛捐雜稅、多予取消、由上四點觀之、增加敎育經費、非另訂條例及增進人民生產能力不可、衡諸各國先例、普及義敎須由國家籌集大宗欵項補助、此可取法也、</p>
<p>三、職業敎育　省立第一職業學校第一農業學校、第一工業學校、省立第一女職校、均設在長沙、第二職業學校、設在常德、第三職業學校設在衡州、第四職業學校設邵陽、第六職業學校設芷江、第八職業學校在桂陽、職業學校之分設各縣、所以謀各縣敎育之平均發展、長沙有私立職業學校十七所、其中受省欵補助者十二所、各縣縣立職業學校共十五所、全省職業學校共計四十四所、　　四、師範敎育　省立第一·第二·第三·第四·第五·第六·中學、均設有高中師範科、省立第一農校、附設鄕村師範、十八年度春季起開辦、第一男子師範學校、設於長沙、至省立第一女子師範學校之校舍、正在建築中、湖南大學文科亦設有敎育系、爲造就中等學校之師資機關、各縣之縣立師範、全省共三十五所、</p>
<p>五、中學敎育　省立第一至第六之中學（三男三女）、係男女分校、設高初兩級、一中（男）二中（女）設在長沙、三中（男）設在常德、四中（女）設在桃源、五中（男）六中（女）均設在衡州、數縣聯合設立之中學、共有七所、自去年起均受省欵補助、亦是謀敎育平均發展之意、單獨設立之縣立中學、共二十五所（無省欵補助）、兩者想較、聯合縣中辦理較優、又私立中學受省欵補助者、有二十四校、不受省欵補助者十五校、全省中校、合計共七十八校、</p>
<p>六、高等敎育　湖南大學係省立高工高農高商合併而成、在趙恒惕時代、即已開辦、中間曾一度停辦、一度改爲中山大學、現仍名湖南大學、設文理工三學院、並附設預科、每月經費、十七年度各月爲一萬六千餘元、十八年度每月爲一萬八千餘元、每月另有臨時費一萬元、該校用費雖少、而造就人才甚多、服務省外者甚衆、服務本省者反不甚多、現擬竭力擴充設備、充實内容、圖書館正在建築中、儀器圖書、亦增添、至十九年度時、全年臨時費可達二十萬元、經常費亦可超過二萬元之數、　來湖南大學之前途、頗有發展希望、此外有私立羣治法政建國法政及醫科大學三校、尙未經敎育部立案、</p>
<p>七·社會敎育　省方設立全省民衆敎育委員會、發行民衆敎育刋物甚多、有省立通俗敎育館·博物館·中山圖書館·各縣亦設民衆敎育委員會、主持全縣民敎事宜、最近省方新建公共體育塲、並以十餘萬元造一中山堂、爲民衆公共講演之用、全省通俗敎育館、有三十一所、講演廳有十八所、圖書館有八十六所、閱報處有二十三所、民衆學校有三百四十六所、貧民工藝廠有十七所、</p>
<p>八、湘省敎育之特點　（甲）經費公開、本省已能完全辦到、建設廉潔政府、應先從敎育界人手、自十七年起、從未拖欠分文、民元以後、以民十八年發給之臨時費爲最多、公開辦法由省敎育廳組織經濟審計委員會、審查本廳賬目、每月公布一次、全省設經費保管委員會、由全省敎育界公推代表七八人爲委員、負責審核全省敎育經費之支出與收入、亦每月公布一次、息金七八千元、涓滴歸公、省立各校之會計主任、由敎育廳直接委派校長祇能從旁監督、另由各校組織審計季員會、亦負監督會計主任之責、再經敎育廳財政廳湖南審計委員會之審核、在此種共同監督情形之下、會計主任、絶對不舞弊、他省敎育界之迭起糾紛、經濟不公開、實爲最大原因、湘省經種種困難、始克實現廳派會計主任之目的、（乙）全省敎育平均發展、省立各校、能分佈至邊遠縣公、聯合中學之有省欵補助、亦爲全省敎育平均發展之一法、各縣圖書館、由省發給萬有文庫、船山遺書各一部、各縣敎育局長之薪水、由省欵按月直接發給、不支縣欵、凡縣敎育費之不滿一萬五千元者、每月由省欵補助六十元、其目的亦無非便令省敎育平均發展也、（丙）成立各縣圖書館、去年上期全省圖書館爲數寥寥、冬季敎廳民令各縣於三個月内成立民衆圖書館、各縣均能遵辦、現在全省圖書館已有八十六所、</p>

<p>大體講起來、這個計畫包括（一）規劃農工商職業補習敎育、（二）籌設各種主要社會敎育機關、（譬如民衆劇場、公體育塲、民衆圖書館、博物館美術館、）（三）推行特殊敎育及感化敎育、（四）改良風欲及提倡民衆娱樂辦法、（五）規定社會敎育與學校敎育的合作辦法、及（六）實施本計劃的大綱、和原來所假定的方案要目、詳略大不相同、原定在目爲（一）確定社會敎育實施目標及方法、（二）（規劃農工商人職業補習敎育、（例如會同農礦部厲行農業推廣事業、（三）提倡與獎勵藝術敎育及籌劃、設立中央及各省音樂美術等館辦法、（四）計劃設立中央及推廣各省圖書館辦法、並編輯各種補充讀物民衆、讀物及通俗材料、（五）籌設中央與各省博物館、並擬訂保存文獻古物等具體辦法、（六）提倡公共體育及推行國府頒布之體育法、（七）籌劃低能與殘廢者之特殊敎育、及罪犯之感化敎育、（八）規劃風俗改良與民衆娱樂事宜、（如改良戲曲鼓書影戲及設立模範劇塲民衆茶室等、）及公私團體所設社會敎育機關監督典指導之辦法、（九）從社會敎育上草擬「民族獨立運動敎育」辦法、（十）規定社會敎育與學校敎育相關事宜、（如鄕村小學附設社會敎育機關等、）（十一）擬訂公民敎育民衆訓練等種類與進行程序、它的分類、應該與原定一樣、至少還要詳密些、因爲邀定起草各專門委員供給的草案不多、兼之詳備和簡略不同、後來又經隨便修改了數次、所以弄得狠不定整、這是我叙述它的編製經過時覺得很抱歉的、本計畫裏面没有包括、（一）公民敎育如黨義訓練等、（二）民衆敎育如民衆補習學校一類東西、也很可注意、不過民衆敎育已另在成年補習敎育計畫内發表、黨義敎育公司敎育、當初係推定黨義敎育組負責、雖然没有料到此組、卒未成立、</p>
<p>一般的分類、原把黨義宣傳、政治訓練、及公民運用四權的培養等、放置在社會敎育範圍之内的、故四年前廣州中山大學有政治訓練委員會之設置、前年大學院内社會敎育處第一科彷彿就是學校以外之社會敎育科、掌管三民主義敎育等、現在高級一點的學校、仍有訓育委員會、這些都是認定社會敎育爲培養健全國民的敎育、把在普通人的眼光中看來社會敎育總有點空洞不着實際的觀念全失掉了、實是有很好的影響、但自後來敎育應該整個的三民主義化的議論起來、我們似乎不應當割裂的碎屑的講黨義講政治、須把它們溶化於課程敎材訓育之中、以免研究黨義的人如研究黨八股一樣、這樣纔再將黨義敎育等和社會敎育分離、</p>
<p>至於民衆敎育、自始就和社會敎育混了宗、故到現在還很難把它們分說明白、雖然、這兩種敎育、性質上儘管相同、質量上則以範圍大小而異、絶對可以淆混的、民衆敎育是以民衆個體作對象、用極流行話來說、是用一個方法、使不識字者識字、無知識技能者、得有普通知識和生活技反、社會敎育却有不同的情形、它常注意到一般的社會文化與學術、以及民衆風俗習慣、它是不但以民衆個體作對象、乃以全般社會作對象的、自然範圍甚大、對於民衆的德育·智育·美育·體育·各方面、都能顧及、民衆敎育的主要部分、爲民衆學校成年職業補習學校等、所以民衆敎育、又是有形式的社會敎育、可是本計畫未曾包含民衆敎育、因爲同時另有一個成年補習敎育計畫了、</p>
<p>以上是社會敎育範圍擴大和縮小的沿革歷史、本計畫也是根據這個經過而編的、</p>
<p>編這個計畫、和編其它的敎育計畫情形差不多、最初由敎育部根據第三届中央執行委員第二次全體會議决議案所設立之敎育方案編製委員會、設社會敎育組、聘請高陽·湯茂如·陳洋藻·劉湛恩·朱懋澄·傅若愚諸君和我共七人爲專家委員、並約常道直·孫紹伯·朱衝濤·俞友仁·　　雲·顧少儀·諸君、分任專門項目的起草、迨各方草案陸續寄到、有繁的·有簡的·甚有缺漏而無草案來的、余以在敎部主管職務的關係、兼任這組主任、曾仔細加以整理分别製成、再經方案委員會增删修改、始告成功、於是由敎部拿與别種實施或改進敎育計畫、合併起來、呌作改進全國敎育方案、呈經行政院轉呈國民政府函送中央政治會議審核、然後才能得發交全國敎育會議大會討論、經過如許廻環曲折的手續和會議、審查不能不說是縝密周詳、然而有些的地方、把極可寳愛的時光、耗費在討論枝節問題上、也有時把許多有價値、或者說、必需的材料、因嫌方案内容過豐篇幅大多的緣故抛棄了、固然說其中具有不得已情形、但我總認爲是很可惜的、又如籌劃低能與殘廢者之特殊敎育及罪犯之感化敎育一項、後來由方案編製委員會、改爲籌設特殊敎育及感化敎育辦法、祛除了低能殘廢、把不良兒童或靑年加入、至於感化罪犯的辦法、現在規定爲先望敎部設立測騐研究處、測騐罪犯的心理、再組織感化敎育課程研究委員會訂定課程標準、在各省並應由敎育廳會同省會法院舉行省會監獄試騐、以後逐漸推廣到各市縣去、這比初來的計議省略簡少得多、初來有朱衝濤先生看報知道敎部組織敎育方案編製委員員會内分十一組、而於盲啞殘廢敎育、獨付闕如爭議甚烈、自撰中國盲啞敎育方案雛議一文、主張盲啞敎育應値得辦敎育者特别注意、把它列入敎育方案中做一單元、他並主張關於法令方面、應注意（一）確定盲啞敎育在敎育行政上的地位、（二）　　左武漢大學代表周鯁生</p>
<p>右湖北敎育廳長黃建中</p>
<p>盲啞敎育的目標（三）盲啞學校制應如何製定、（四）盲啞學校的課問題、關於實施方面並注意、（一）全國盲啞學童的估計、（二）盲啞敎育經費問題（三）師資之培養、（四）推行盲啞敎育之步驟、又俞友仁君送來之盲啞敎育方案、也於盲啞敎育的目標、盲啞敎學方式、盲啞訓育標準、以及推廣盲啞敎育的辦法、規劃得也很詳、可惜因篇幅有限、又没有把它收入本計劃裏面好在這些主張屬於實際實施方面的多、將來母妨由地方設計試騐推行就是了、</p>
<p>此外還有（一）改良風俗提倡民衆娱樂和、（二）從社會敎育上草擬民族獨立運動敎育兩個辦法、後一個辦法是依據中央訓練部的意思草擬的、從民族主義的立場上、用敎育的方法、去敎導民衆和靑年、明瞭我國受列强帝國主義壓迫的情形、振作奮發、以求中國之自由平等、其辦法也是從利用歌詞小說等入手、和前一辦法改良風俗及提倡民衆娱樂有很多地方相同、前一個辦法、比較算是很詳細、其目的在提倡社會優美的風尙、涵養民衆良好的習俗、改革社會舊有的惡習、實施人民愉快和樂的生活、以發揚民族高尙偉大的精神、它的實施改良風化的辦法、分爲消極和積極的兩種、消極的就是把舊有的惡習和妨害風化的事業設法取締或禁止、積極的在提倡民衆正當娱樂、就後者看來可以說改良風化、必須提倡民衆正當娱樂、又從另一方面說、果然民衆得到了正當娱樂、風化便自能改良、兩者是互相關係、不可以分離的、至於它們的實施手續、不外分爲登記·訓練·審查·處分·或提倡獎勵數種了、但是這兩個辦法也未完全的加入本計劃内、現在追溯本計劃編製的經過起來、談到以上三大點、未免覺得偏而不全、缺而不實呵、我們編製和討論計劃、最好就着計劃本身所能發展到的部分去討論、不要强從外面加上一個限制、這種限制不獨是無被於討論、並且是極容易變成一個障礙物、妨害計劃的優點、况且拿社會敎育當作副業、不像學校敎育那麽重要、也是說不通的、</p>
<p>現在讓我略舉數點來討論、便可曉得簡單不完全和惜之處在那裏、譬如說說本計劃原定的第一篇是確定社會敎育的目標及實施方法、供給材料及草案者、有高·湯·常·孫諸位、其最精彩處、係主張實施社會敎育的目標應該根據我國敎育宗旨及其實施方針而定、我國敎育宗旨上說說中華民國敎育根據三民主義、以充實人民生活、扶植社會生存、發展國民生計、延續民族生命爲目的、務期民族獨立、民權普遍、民生發展、以促進世界大同、其實施方針第三項說、社會敎育必須人人具備近代都市及農村生活之常識、家庭經濟改善之技能公民自治必備之資格、保護公共事業及森林園地之習慣、養老恤貧防災互助之美德、又第七項說、各級學校及社會敎育應一體注重發展國民之體育、若將上述敎育宗旨與其實施方針分析之、就成下列二表、</p>
<p>敎育宗旨</p>
<p>扶植社會生存延續民族生命　社會方面</p>
<p>發展國民生計充實人民生活　個人方面</p>
<p>世界大同民族獨立　　　　　社會方面</p>
<p>民權普遍民生發展　　　　　個人方面</p>
<p>實施方針</p>
<p>近代都市及農村生活之常識家庭改善之技能國民體育之發展公民自治必備之資格｜面個人方面</p>
<p>保護公共事業及森林園地之習慣</p>
<p>觀上列兩表、可見社會敎育對於個人與社會、應當雙方兼顧的、從個人方面看去、社會敎育當使社會各份子均得有繼續不斷之生長、不分男女長幼及程度的高下、如知識·能力·精神·身體·各方面、均得隨時隨世有繼長爭高的機會、因此國民生計才得發展、人民生活才得充實、從社會方面看去、社會敎育、當使社會各份子都成爲社會上能負責的、健全的、且富有生產力的國民、因此民族生命才得扶植、因復於社會敎育内分爲公民（即國民）敎育·生計敎育·藝術敎育·健康敎育等項）並把這些項的敎育目標、依照上述二表、詳細列舉、並先述實的總綱、由總綱以至於細目、叙述和分拆得都很詳、只是後來没有找着機會把它編訂進去呵、</p>
<p>現在本計畫留遺下來、所包含的重要部分、另有一本很簡明的方案摘要、想研究這計畫内容、或參加此番全國會議、欲窺覽全文而没有功夫的人、很可以先看那本摘要、拿它作個臺階兒、所以這裏用不着說甚麽要點非要點了、不過就這殘餘的計畫而論、裏面有幾條實施原則、如（甲）行政組織宜簡單、（乙）各種實施機關宜集中、（丙）實施程序宜先實騐而後推行、（丁）實施人才宜特别訓練、（戊）社會敎育經費宜寬籌、並保障其獨立、（己）政府宜引導社會、用全力推行社會敎育、却是很關緊要的、其餘大都是利用這幾個原則去解决各實施問題、此外如職業補習學校之分類、民衆劇塲、公共敎育塲、民衆圖書館、民衆博物館美術館及美術展覽會、之分年籌設與推廣、以及社會敎育與學校敎育的合作與分工辦法、皆是本計畫之精粹、總之本計畫有上述那麽一個的經過、弄得這計畫彷彿是一點一點凑弄來的、而精神也不是完全始終一貫有系統的、希望蒞會的敎育界同志不咅敎的補充和糾正、</p>
<h3 id="c131">會議議事細則 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>先由吳研因科長、宣讀議事細則原文、蔣部長聲明、本細則根據民權初步而成、惟第十七條之所以附列次多數意見者、所以備呈送中央時、有所參考、後由九十八號會員提出出席會員臨時動議、可否改爲五分之一或六分之二、徐榮光主張爲出席會員十人、朱經農謂如出方案範圍以外、限制宜嚴範圍以内不確定爲十人、趙迺傳謂、此次議案、之臨時動議、限制爲出席會員之四分之一、非報到會員之數、請全體注意、此時主席付表决謂主張維持原案者、請舉手、得四十一票、結果、爲少數、同時陳布雷先生提議、會員出席十人以上之附議、得臨時動議、得四十九票、多數通過、</p>
<p>第十條之草案、張默君主張同一議案、每人發言、宜改爲不得近三次、得二十三票、未通過、</p>
<h3 id="c132">討論審查規則 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>仍由吳研因先將審查規則、逐條宣讀畢、熊常飛提議、第二條宜修改、「爲各組審查委員、由議長於會員中指定、提出大會通過之、」下文删去、朱經農主張專門委員及主管科長、得出席聲明、不加入討論、張默君主張、審查委員、由自己認定、專門委員及主管科長、得列席審查、朱經農主張、維持審查委員之由議長指定之辦法、下半段同意、於張默君俞慶棠主張、「各組審查委員、由議長於會員中指定報告大會通過之、」仍持最後决定、</p>

<p>（五）天才兒的能力、遠出普通兒童之上、尋常的敎材敎法、不但不足以使其努力、而且不能引起他們的興趣、其結果必至於厭視學校的生活、但若另班敎授、就可以用適合他們能力的材料、如此不但可以加增其求學的興趣、而且可以將就學的年限縮短課程的内容充實、自然成績必較爲可觀、而且時間同金錢、亦都較爲經濟、</p>
<p>（六）低能兒祇能對付較簡單、較具體的事物、新定的敎材如果能適合於他們智能的程度、則學業的成績、一定也很好、他們就可以藉一藝之長、以自謀生活、這就是滅輕家庭的負擔增進社會的效率、</p>
<p>（七）天才兒是將來學術上的開路先鋒、社會上的中堅份子、如不設法去啟發其能力、必至因没有充分發展的機會、而碌碌終身、毫無成就、或爲環境中惡習所染、而至於墜落、現在如能發見眞正的天才兒、去敎育他們、將來一定可以提高我國在世界學術上位置、而且有了理想的領袖、一定能夠切實的爲羣衆造幸福、</p>
<p>（二）辦法</p>
<p>（一）由敎育部聘請敎育專家、合擬特别的詳細辦法、經實施之後、如發見缺點、即宜隨時修正、</p>
<p>（二）由各級學校、自視其人才設備及經濟能力、設低能兒或天才兒的特别班、</p>
<p>（三）參考歐美各國特殊敎育的成績及辦法、以資借鑑、</p>
<p>（四）各校應將試辦的成績及困難的地方、隨時報告、以借大家的取法及研究、</p>
<p>▲規定留學生公費標準案</p>
<p>（一）理由</p>
<p>（一）我國派遺留學生的歷史、一經是很長了、但是公費的多寡、向無一定的標準、同是留學一國、也有軒輊之分、因爲標準未定、無所遵循、祇好聽各機關的自由分配、如此則同是公費生、亦有榮枯的現象了、</p>
<p>（二）向來所用公費的單位、也很不一致、有的用本國的銀幣爲單位、（如大部份省費）有的用該留學國的金幣爲單位、（如淸華大學學費）、金的價格、時有漲落、以國幣爲單位者、每月的學費、亦隨之爲增减了、</p>
<p>（三）公費的數目、差不多是沿立立襲已往的慣例、没有去注意該留學國生活程度的變遷、所以往往十年前所定下的數目、至今尙在沿用、而不知生活程度、已增高不少、再者近一二年來金價日漲、則無形之中、反而减少學費、以維持增萬的生活了、</p>
<p>（二）辦法</p>
<p>（一）由敎育部聘熟悉各國情形的人、按照各國生活的現狀、擬定一種劃一的公費標準、俾遣派的機關有所遵循、</p>
<p>（二）同時製成表格、寄交各國領·使·館、請其轉發、現時留學國外的學生、及在國外服務住家、及經商的人、調查他們生活的程度、此項材料收集之後、可供訂定標準者參考、</p>
<p>（三）公費的單位、應以該留學國的國幣爲標準（如法國用佛郎美國用美金）</p>
<p>（四）注意生活程度的變遷、每隔多少時候、應當重訂新標準、</p>
<p>（五）注意所習的科目、如必需時、另發若干特别經費以示公允、（如習自然科學者的實騐費習音樂者的樂費具等等、）</p>
<p>▲請敎育部限制敎育經費</p>
<p>困難的省份及機關派遣</p>
<p>學生留學外國並如何善</p>
<p>後案</p>
<p>（一）理由</p>
<p>（一）留學生的學費、實在包含學費及衣食住零用等費、一旦發生問題、不但無法求學、即維持生活、亦感困難、家境稍裕的學生、還可以由家人勉强接濟、若是家境淸寒、即欲返國、而川資無着、祇好坐以待斃、</p>
<p>（二）不能按月收到學費的人、或常常數月得不到學費的人、假定家長不能接濟、而又無其他補助的來源、大多數的人是在此種狀况之下、其勢祇好去尋工作、尋不着工作的人、一方面旣碍學業、他方面又受該留學國種種的限制、如美政府禁止學生做工、何等痛苦、何等不便、</p>
<p>（三）勤苦的學生、一面工作、一面仍選讀規定的學程、其結果必能摧殘他們的健康、這豈是國家培育人才的意思、</p>
<p>（四）意志薄弱一點的人、必陷於悲觀的境地、</p>
<p>（二）辦法</p>
<p>（一）由敎育部通令各省各機關、非到敎育經費、確有把把的時候、不要遣派學生留學外國、</p>
<p>（二）遣送之後、須按月（或按季）預匯學費、以寄到之日爲標準、毋得逾期、</p>
<p>（三）經費確有把握的省份、或機關、如一旦發生意外的問題、已遣派出國之留學生的公費、應當儘先設法維持、</p>
<p>▲大中小學敎職員及學生</p>
<p>應着本國服裝並用本</p>
<p>國材料案</p>
<p>（一）理由</p>
<p>（一）當此金貴銀錢的時候、採用洋貨的損失、更足以驚人、不着西服、就是開源節流、很有效的一種辦法、西服的材料、都是毛織品、而毛織品大都是由國外輸入的、一方面蒙了以重金買洋貨的損失、他方面足以阻碍國貨的發展、服裝一項、爲日常所需、不可以一刻缺的、比之一切敎育用品、如文具儀器化學藥料等等的耗費、要大得多、所以敎育界中人、如能用國貨製本國衣服就是國家財力上的一種救濟、</p>
<p>（二）無論那一國都有他的特殊的時尙不可以强同的、一國的服裝、是一國最顯著的代表、而且是一種民族特性的表現、應當保存本國的色彩、不應模仿别國的風尙、然後可以發揚民族固有的精神、而激起民族團結的觀念、除非是一個被征服的國家、不然他的語言風尙禮節、以及服飾、都不該整個的效法别國的人、</p>
<p>（三）西裝的耗費、較之中裝爲大、即最下的材料、也比中裝爲貴、敎育本是淸貧的職業、中小學敎職員的進欵、尤爲有限、如果西服的代價、占去他們的預算裏很大的一部份、豈不是很不經濟的事、至於學生方面、就是給與家長較重的負擔、中人之家、能夠送兒子到中學或大學裏去、已是不易、再加上服裝的消耗、大足以阻碍升學的機會、豈不是因小失大呢、</p>

<p>▲司令部發告社會人士書</p>
<p>（一）表現民族健全精神</p>

<p>份注意、次述童子軍、乃英人貝登堡首先創辦、及中國童子軍之沿革、末述中國國民黨領導下的童子軍、是負有實現三民主義、完成中國國民革命建設、民有民治民享新國家的責任的、現今中國一般的靑年、大都志氣頽唐、身體孱弱、眞有東方病夫的神氣、所以民族精神、也就消磨殆盡、黨童子軍要有堅確明瞭的民族、意識來保持、並發揚自己民族的精神和文化、並要把德智羣美體五育、都有充分的發展、來運用民權、完成其他一切國民的義務、更要有生產和技術的訓練、養成愛用國貨的習慣、來促進生產、並扶助民生的發展、並謂此次總檢閱目的、在表演各童軍訓練的成績、好的給以鼓勵、差的設法改進、各省市的童子軍、一時聚集在京除可聯絡童子軍間友誼外、且可使各處童軍、對本黨領導的意義、有更深切的認識、我們同時希望各界同胞、對本黨指導下的童軍、有正確的了解、一致起來、促進中國童子軍事業發展、</p>

<p>▲與母作死别　昨日午後二時、特區地方法院、通知捕房、着將汪·李·榮·沈·四犯、解至第三法庭、由執行推事程尙豐升座、宣示省令、訊該犯等有無遺言、當據汪連貴供、伊又名汪朝林、現年廿八歲、原籍無錫、滬寓在法院後面二四六四號、家中尙有父母兄弟、伊係木匠、據拘時有長衫三件、皮袍·雨衣·各一件、請求發還、伊母今亦在庭、乞准與母一面、法官許可後、汪乃與其母隔别述數語</p>
<p>▲强作從容狀　繼據李阿福供稱、又名趟金標、現年四十歲、原籍寗波、滬寓在福煦路七二一號、並無何種遺言、榮正昌供、伊又名小榮、無錫人、滬寓在周家橋、專事綁票、請代致函蘭路厚生紗廠布房間、交伊兄榮月淸、俾其知我已於今日槍决、言時故作從容狀態、</p>

<p>— 憶儂</p>
<p>余生平有愛蘭癖。友人有藝蘭者。必邀余往一賞。花朝第三日。半淞園有賽蘭之舉。余聞之色然喜。因蟄居滬市塵囂紛擾。憂悶不自適。久欲得一蕭曠地。呼吸新鮮之空氣。是日余與友人李雪鷗。林笠湖。驅車前往。行抵半淞園。甫入門。繞曲廓而進。即聞有異香。及至廳堂。如入九畹。淸凈無塵。芬芳可愛。亭亭玉立。嫵媚多姿。四圍陳列。參差上下。有蘭花二百餘盆。花有荷瓣。梅瓣。海棠瓣之分。心有素心。丹心。紫花心之别。色有玉色。翡翠色。淺湖色之異。名種紛披。各含殊采。葉則搖曳生姿。花則嫣然欲笑。余與友人飲茗於其中。靜中領略。祇覺其香氣靜穆。齒頰亦爲之留芬。李君雪鷗曰。凡花皆有香。而惟蘭之香。則馥郁而韻淸。凡花皆有色。而惟蘭之色。則深翠而韶秀。是故處懸崖空谷之中。托根吐穎。不以無人而不芳。蘭爲國香。彌足珍已。而其中最寳貴而可愛者。則有一種係赭石墨色。花光古茂。風韻幽雅。尤爲余所欣賞。與粤東之觀音蘭相彷彿。余曾於紅藢老人繪留春圖中一見之。尤爲滬上藝蘭家所罕覩也。余因憶家中藝蘭數十本。種皆閩粵之佳者。頻年以來。鞅掌風塵。不遑居處。遂置蘭於風饕雪虐之中。而未得愛護而灌漑之。今覩此蘭。不禁爲之感喟。亦未知余家中所愛之蘭。今日爲何如耶。頃者滬上藝蘭家。旣各出其精品以比賽。其平時培植之功。爲不少矣。余與友人分箋默坐。對花寫生。惟覺香氣環繞於筆墨之間。林君笠湖畫之。酷肖其形者。其閑靜處如仙子。其旖旎處如美人。其淸超處如高士。其秀逸處如騷人。是花是畫。驟視之不易辨。豈非極化工之能事耶。余乃爲賦三絶以寵之。茲附錄於下。春風淡蕩幽香媚。玉魄冰魂月有痕。花品自應淸逸勝。塵襟不許到名園。異采奇葩茁一枝。留春圖裏久欽奇。而今邂逅親芳躅。貂出花光絶世姿。故鄕風物近如何。夢憶庭階花影疏。十載荃蓀空寫怨。結廬何日帶雲鋤。</p>

<p>近今戚友譚晤之頃。獻茗而外。輒復佐以紙烟。以示敬意。惟按吾國舊時。本無烟類洎乎明季。始有鼻烟一品。蓋考自趙之謙之勇盧閒話。内載「鼻烟來自大西洋意大利亞國。明萬歷九年。利瑪竇汎海入廣東。始通中國」云云。迺知鼻烟實爲烟類之始祖。且以鼻吸不以口含也。嗣後國人研究烟料。自製爲水烟旱烟等類。各適所好。近歲捲烟盛行。前者幾在淘汰之列。而吸用鼻烟者。尤寥若晨星。特鼻烟在當時。亦頗爲顯官高僧輩所樂用。惟價奇昻。上品每兩約需五十金。嘗聞贛省故官歐陽霖氏。癖之尤甚。每歲耗於此者。達四五千金。並藏有鼻烟壺極夥。均屬珍品。暇輒摩挲爲樂云。</p>

<p>近來情形極佳。每日仍甚擁擠。昨日（星期五）觀衆尤其起鬨。汾河灣演完時。呌簾有七次之多。因臺下已眞能了解。蓋聽過者傳說愈廣愈詳。來聽者愈衆而愈不厭。目下凡劇中滑稽可笑之處。臺下皆笑。足證其頗能了解也。</p>
<p>哥倫比亞大學全體敎授。開一茶會。專請畹華到會者二百餘人。校長夫人特出招待。畹有演說。略謂今日到此。十分榮幸但余此行之目的。係來美學習者。彷彿學生資格。希望各位敎授。以學生資格待我。勿吝敎誨爲幸。至於此次表演。謬承諸君揄揚贊助。得獲圓滿結果。至爲感謝。以後尙希源源賜敎等語。賓主盡歡而散。</p>
<p>又萬國學生會於前日公讌畹華。並請演說。到會者一千數百人。畹即席致辭。略謂久聞美國立有此會。藉使不同國籍之學生。相聚一堂。聯絡各國之感情。用意至善。蘭芳今能到此。曷勝欣快。此次來美。爲研究劇學而來。資格與學生相等。亦想吸取西方文明。而貢獻祖國。尙望時時指敎云云。</p>
<p>現因南方小城均來約演。惟每處多係短期。而安置行裝加以往來搬運等等。手續旣繁。需費亦多。故擬在紐約演五星期再休息旬日。以便一行游覽。並參觀各戲劇組織。再往芝加哥演六七日。即往舊金山矣。在彼約亦須勾留月餘也。（三月六日）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Tianjin Dispatch: Yan has divided his defenses into three lines. The first line extends from Hejian to Dezhou, the second from Baoding to Daming, and the third is at Niangziguan. His plan is to adopt a defensive posture and avoid hasty advances. Yan sent people to lobby Fan Xingmin's troops, but Fan sternly refused. Tan Wenjiang, a former major offender in tomb raiding who had been sentenced to death by military law, was also released by Yan in an attempt to connect with Sun Dianying's forces. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tianjin News: When the Jin army in Tianjin retreated from the front lines, they conscripted laborers and carts, displaying no discipline whatsoever. Those residing in the Chinese concession and Hebei were unable to escape this. The people are extremely panicked, and a continuous stream is fleeing to the concessions and other places for refuge. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Beiping, 15th Dispatch: (1) Yan Xishan has been continuously transporting troops from the plains of Dezhou, Zhengding, Daming, and other places towards Tanggu and Tangshan, totaling approximately three divisions. East of Tianjin, military vehicles are congested, causing traffic obstruction. (2) Yan Xishan has ordered the county magistrates of various counties in Hebei and Shanxi to recruit 2,000 to 6,000 soldiers per county. The county governments and public security bureaus are implementing forced conscription under strict orders, causing great unrest among the people. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhengzhou News: (1) Feng has ordered the Northwest Army to adopt a policy of feinting attacks and living off the land. Therefore, various units of the Northwest Army are currently putting on a show of strength, using miscellaneous Henan troops as sacrifices. (2) After Wan Xuancai's troops arrived in Kaifeng, incidents of looting, rape, and kidnapping occurred, causing great resentment among merchants and civilians. Wan intends to resign as chairman under the pretext of mourning his parents. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yan visited Zou and Xie on the morning of the 15th and talked for a long time.

As for Chen Gongbo's proposal to form a military government first, Zou and Xie mentioned whether financial and diplomatic preparations had been made. Yan advocated for a slight delay, because using Shanxi's finances alone to meet the needs of all parties would be unbalanced and a comprehensive plan was necessary, starting with consolidation. As for diplomacy, it was not a problem because diplomacy was entirely based on facts, he said. It is now decided that a party affairs meeting will be held on the 19th, with each province electing one representative from among the representatives to discuss solutions together.

<h3 id="e7">Types of World News <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Those who pay attention to world news, according to reports from various foreign wire services, generally find it falls into three categories: industry shows daily progress and invention; commerce is in daily decline and distress; and various human conflicts, though daily efforts are made to eliminate them, are increasingly apparent. While other news also appears from time to time, in summary, these three are the center of the world situation today.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can be seen that researching various things in the world is easy, but researching the human heart is the most difficult. Handling the material aspects of the world has daily progress, but handling the relationship between people is difficult to improve. The population increases daily, and the human heart becomes more cunning, making it more and more difficult to handle. Those who research all materials have daily progress, so there are many industrial inventions and they are becoming increasingly developed. The population increases, the human heart becomes cunning, and the way to handle the relationship between people is becoming increasingly impossible. Therefore, human conflicts arise everywhere and at all times, and the decline of commerce cannot avoid this. There is a pivotal interrelationship between these, and even if one wants to try to save them, it is impossible. Looking at a country, everyone is weak, and only one is strong; everyone is foolish, and only one is wise. Then the strong and the wise can obtain a superior position. The world between countries is the same. Other countries are weak, and one or two countries are strong; other countries are foolish, and one or two countries are wise. Then the strong and the wise will also be in a superior position. Today, the human beings of the world, apart from technical knowledge, are gradually becoming equal, but the superior position inherited from generation to generation is still desired to be maintained and not lost. How can this eliminate human conflicts and obtain a good way to handle the relationship between people?</p>

<h3 id="e8">Russia Has Not Replied to Notification <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>

<h3 id="e56">Two Major Bribery Cases in Japan <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>All Guilty in the Private Railway Bribery Case</p>
<p>Preliminary Hearing of the Echigo Railway Bribery Case Concluded</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th - The preliminary hearing for the four private railway bribery cases related to former Railway Minister Ogawa concluded today. It was decided that all those involved were guilty. Those who received bribes: Ogawa Heikichi, former assemblyman Aoyama Kenzo; those who aided in receiving bribes: former assemblyman Kasuga Jibun, Ogawa's secretary Moriya Motodai, broker Sumiya Mitsujiro, member of the House of Peers Tomiyasu Yasutaro; those who offered bribes: President of Higashi-Osaka Electric Railway Ota Mitsuhiro, executives Tanaka Shichino, Yoshikawa Yoshiteru, Shirai Mitsusuke, President of Nara Electric Railway Ide Shigezo, Executive Director Nagata Momozo, President of Ise Electric Railway Kumazawa Ichijutsu, executive Isaka Hidegoro, President of Hakata Bay Electric Railway Ota Seizo, President of Hokkaido Railway Ogami Keigoro, executives Hyodo Eisaku, Watabe Kohei.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th - The Echigo Railway and Yamanote Express Railway malfeasance case is one of the five major scandals of Showa. Together with the private railway case of former Railway Minister Ogawa Heikichi, it is a sensational case that has captured the attention of the world. The Tokyo District Court judge, through the hand of preliminary hearing judge Morozumi, spent five months and finally concluded the preliminary hearing yesterday. Kashiwabara Ichita, Kusumi Toma, and others were all found guilty. The preliminary hearings for the private railway approvals and acquisition bribery cases related to Ogawa Heikichi, such as the Hokkaido Railway, Higashi-Osaka Electric Railway, Ise Electric Railway, and Hakata Bay Electric Railway, are expected to conclude in the 18th and 19th. Preliminary hearing judge Watanabe is currently consulting the opinions of prosecutor Ishigooka and organizing the case files. These issues will stir up a significant storm in political circles before the special parliament. It is said that the details of the Echigo Railway case, in which Kashiwabara and Satake obtained money and stocks, are as follows: When Kashiwabara, the former Minister of Education, was the Secretary-General of the Seiyukai party, he accepted a bribe at the request of Kusumi Toma, the president of Echigo Railway, to lobby the House of Representatives to pass the Echigo Railway acquisition bill. Satake acted as an intermediary and Kusumi gave 30,000 yen to Kashiwabara in three installments, of which 20,000 yen was handed over by Kusumi to Kashiwabara in Tokyo through Satake. Regarding the approval of the Yamanote Express Railway, Kashiwabara obtained 5,000 shares and Satake 10,000 shares from an auditor of the railway as remuneration. However, both used the names of others. This has now been fully clarified. Although the preliminary hearing has concluded, it will take considerable time for the public and private trials, as well as the investigation of defense materials. The public trial of the Kashiwabara and Ogawa cases will not be held until September at the earliest. The crimes of former Minister of Education Kashiwabara only became clear after the exposure of the scandal. Prime Minister Hamaguchi, who recommended Kashiwabara as Minister of Education, should bear some responsibility, albeit to a lesser degree. A portion of the House of Peers has raised the issue of the Prime Minister's responsibility, demanding his reflection, and stating that his silence on this matter is disrespectful. In the future special parliament, both houses will vigorously pursue questioning. Furthermore, Ryokaku Seiei, the preliminary hearing judge of the Tokyo District Court who contributed to the investigation of the private railway bribery case, will be promoted to judge of the Tokyo Court of Appeal after the conclusion of this preliminary hearing. He stated that he conducted a thorough investigation in a completely unbiased state and is confident that Kashiwabara and others are guilty. However, a certain powerful lawyer stated that it is inappropriate to conclude that Kashiwabara committed a crime. Such a fabricated investigation will inevitably cause a major disturbance when the public trial opens in the future.</p>

<p>▲ Two Hundred and Twenty-Third Meeting</p>
<p>The Central Political Conference held its 223rd meeting at 8:00 AM today (16th). The attending members were Hu Hanmin, Gu Yingfen, Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Song Ziwen, Shao Lizi, Ye Chucang, and Wu Jingheng. The attending members were Shao Yuan</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Chong, Li Fuyi, Wang Zhengting, Li Wenlong, Kong Xiangxi, and Liu Luyin. The chairman was Chiang Kai-shek. The discussion items were as follows: (1) Member and President of the Judicial Yuan Wang Chonghui proposed that, according to the National Government's order on June 27th of the Republic of China, if any national citizen intends to insult the portrait of the Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang, publicly damages, removes, or insults it, they should be punished in accordance with Article 167 of the Criminal Law, the same as those who damage, remove, or insult the national flag and national emblem of the Republic of China. If there is such behavior after the order was issued on June 27th of the Republic of China, they should be punished according to the law. However, if there is such behavior before the order was issued, according to the principle stated in Article 1 of the Criminal Law, since there was no law imposing criminal punishment at the time of the behavior, it should not be considered a crime. The question is whether the behavior before the order was issued should not be considered a crime, or whether it should be retroactively pursued. Please make a decision. The resolution was not to pursue it retroactively. (2) The National Government Civil Service Department stated that the 71st State Council meeting resolved to specially appoint Liu Ruiheng as the Minister of Health. Since it concerns the appointment and removal of specially appointed officials, it should be forwarded to the Central Political Conference for retroactive approval to comply with the established regulations.

<p>The Capital Construction Committee held a group proposal review committee on the morning of the 16th, followed immediately by the first general meeting. The proceedings are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Group Review Committee</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM, members of the first, second, and third groups gathered at the meeting place and began reviewing proposals. The attendance was enthusiastic, and results were achieved for all proposals. These were then submitted to the general meeting report. The meeting adjourned around 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>▲ First General Meeting</p>
<p>After the review committee adjourned, the original agenda called for a work report from the committee. All members attended, including Zhang Renjie, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Zhu Peide, Wang Zhengting, Li Chugong, Chen Yu, Kong Xiangxi, Liu Ruiheng, Wei Daoming, Yang Zongjian, Dong Xiujia, Shen Yi, Qin Hua, Liu Jiwen, Shao Yuanchong, Yang Xiji, Ma Fuxiang, Tang Zhi, Lai Lian, Yuan Hui, Lu Rushan, Xu Chaotong, Wu Bizhi, Wang Nu, Chen Yi, Xia Guangyu, Jin Guobao, Schubart, Zhang Yiou, Zhang Zhijiang, Chen Rui, and Zhang Jianming, totaling 24 people. Thirteen observers were present. The meeting commenced at 10:30 AM, with Zhang Renjie as chairman. After formalities, Secretary-General Liu Jiwen reported that the attendance met the legal quorum and declared the meeting open. Secretary Hong Lanyou reported that, according to the agenda, a work report was still pending, but it had already been distributed to all members. To save time, it would not be presented orally, and the discussion would immediately commence on the reports from each group of the review committee. After Hong's report, each group member reported the review results as follows:</p>
<p>First Group Review Report: Reviewer Xu Xinwu reported the review results, stating that the committee reviewed the following cases: (1) Case 51 proposed by committee member Sun Ke and Case 5 proposed by advisor Schubart regarding the central political zone. The two cases differed slightly on the zone issue. Sun proposed locating the zone south of Zhongshan Road, while Schubart argued that it should not be confined to Zhongshan Road and that attention should be paid to preserving historical sites. The review committee's opinion was that it should not be limited to the business of Zhongshan Road, but should include the entire Ming Palace area and pay attention to the preservation of historical sites, in line with government orders. As the detailed arrangements could not be decided in a short time, it was proposed that they be submitted to the engineering group for further study. After the report, members expressed their opinions, and it was resolved to adopt the review committee's opinion and instruct the engineering group to formulate detailed measures. (2) Regarding the capital construction work allocation timetable, committee member Liu Jiwen proposed strictly defining the capital construction work schedule and setting a deadline for completion, while committee member Sun Ke proposed formulating procedures for the implementation of the city plan. The two cases were generally the same, but differed slightly in the details of the work. The review concluded that the principle of phased construction should be adopted, but the overall capital construction plan and fundraising had not yet been decided. It was proposed that, after the completion of the overall plan and the fundraising, the standing committee would formulate detailed measures. After the chairman put it to a vote, it was resolved to adopt the review report. (3) Cases 33, 34, 45, and 56. Except for Case 45, which was not discussed jointly, the remaining three cases concerned the location of the central station, the layout of railway lines within the capital, and Liu Jiwen's proposal to locate the central station in Xiaoying, while Sun Ke proposed locating the central station north of Houzaimen. Schubart proposed establishing a small station in addition to the central station, separating passenger and freight stations. The review committee believed that Schubart's railway line traversed the capital area and was related to road traffic, so it should encircle the area to avoid obstruction. At the same time, the review committee considered this matter to be of great importance and did not formulate specific measures. It was proposed that the Capital Construction Committee and the Ministry of Railways decide on the measures. After the chairman put it to a discussion, it was resolved to adopt the review committee's opinion. Case 45 was a proposal by committee member Kong to complete the Beijing-Xiangtan Railway. The review committee considered that this was beyond the authority of the committee and should be handled by the Ministry of Railways. Kong Xiangxi then stood up to explain the reasons, stating that it was greatly related to capital construction. The general meeting then resolved to request the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Railways to handle it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Second Group Review Report: Committee member Kong Xiangxi reported on the capital construction funding and fundraising matters, submitting Case 37 on the implementation plan for capital construction bonds and Case 30 on the proposed methods for promoting capital construction bonds for a public resolution, which were merged with Case 28 on the proposed implementation plan for allocating capital construction funding among the provinces. The result was to issue 30 million in capital construction bonds according to Case 28, with the methods in Cases 37 and 30 as reference. After the chairman put it to a vote, it was resolved to adopt it. The group also reviewed Case 7, a proposal by He Jian on opinions regarding capital zoning and construction funding. The review committee considered that the construction of the capital should be funded by the government, but within the possible scope, the principle of attracting merchants to invest should be adopted. This case could be submitted to the standing committee for adoption. Case 44, proposed by Kong Xiangxi, stipulated that each province and city should be responsible for building capital routes and encouraged overseas Chinese to donate funds for construction. The review committee considered that this case could be merged with Case 27, proposed by Liu Jiwen, stating that the capital trunk roads should be built by each province, with the name of each province as the name of each road. The methods proposed in the original proposal were still appropriate and could be adopted as is. Case 36, proposed by Liu Jiwen, requested the allocation of funds for sewers to facilitate capital construction. The review committee considered that the main purpose of this case was still sound, but the stated amount of waste discharged per person per day in Nanjing, whether 200 gallons or 60 gallons, should be reviewed by the engineering group, and whether this cost was within the initial capital construction cost of 50 million should be discussed and decided by the standing committee. After the report, the secretariat submitted each case for discussion by the general meeting, which then passed each item. The meeting adjourned around 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Summary of Resolutions</p>
<p>The cases reviewed by the first group and resolved by the general meeting are as follows: (1) Sun Ke's proposal to define the scope of the central political zone and build it, and Liu Jiwen's introduction of advisor Schubart's proposal to prepare drawings of the layout of the central political zone for adoption, were discussed jointly. The resolution was that the scope of the central political zone should be relocated in accordance with the previous order of the National Government, and the principles proposed by Schubart were adopted. The detailed plan was submitted to the engineering group for joint research. (2) Liu Jiwen's proposal to determine the capital construction work schedule and completion deadline, and Sun Ke's proposal to formulate procedures for the implementation of the city plan, were discussed jointly. The resolution was that the principle of phased construction should be adopted, but many of the projects to be undertaken have not yet been decided, and the phased construction process is closely related to economic issues. After the completion of the overall plan, the standing committee should refer to the fundraising methods for economic issues and resolve them appropriately before determining detailed phased measures to suit the plans and economic conditions of the ministry. (3) Liu Jiwen's proposal to determine the location of the station in the city in advance in order to complete the road system, and Sun Ke's proposal to continue to follow the original plan of the Capital Design Office and locate the central station north of Houzaimen in the Ming Palace, and Liu Jiwen's introduction of advisor Schubart's proposal to prepare a capital railway system and station location plan for public resolution, were discussed jointly. The resolution was that the location of the central station and the layout of railway lines in the capital area would be submitted to the standing committee to be reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Railways. (4) Kong Xiangxi's proposal to advance the Beijing-Xiangtan Railway to promote the development of the capital was resolved to be adopted as is, and a request was sent to the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Railways to handle it. Second group: (1) He Jian's proposal regarding opinions on capital zoning and construction funding, submitted for public resolution, was resolved to be submitted to the standing committee for adoption. (2) Liu Jiwen's proposal to raise funds for sewers to facilitate capital construction was resolved to be adopted in principle, and technical issues were submitted to the standing committee for handling. (3) Kong Xiangxi's proposal to stipulate that each province and city should be responsible for building capital routes and to encourage overseas Chinese to donate funds for construction, and Liu Jiwen's proposal that the capital trunk roads should be built by each province, with the name of each province as the name of each road, were discussed jointly. The resolution was to adopt it in principle and submit it to the standing committee for proper handling. (4) Liu Jiwen's proposal to formulate an implementation plan for each province to share the capital construction funding, submitted for public resolution, and Kong Xiangxi's proposal for the capital construction bond implementation plan were discussed jointly. The resolution was to adopt it. (5) Liu Jiwen's proposal to formulate methods for promoting capital construction bonds, submitted for public resolution, was resolved to be submitted to the standing committee for reference.</p>
<p>▲ The Third Group Held a Meeting in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The third group was originally scheduled to meet in the morning, but it did not materialize due to circumstances. Therefore, the group did not report at the first general meeting. The group held a special meeting in the afternoon to discuss the proposals and decided to submit them to the general meeting for discussion tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲ Temporary Review Group Meeting Held in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The general meeting was originally scheduled to continue in the afternoon, but it was rescheduled for tomorrow morning due to the need to hold a temporary review group meeting in the afternoon. The temporary review group met at 3:00 PM, attended by committee members Wei Daoming, Liu Ruiheng, Liu Jiwen, Dong Xiujia, Shen Yi, Liu Luyin, Hong Lanyou, Chen Yu, and Ye Chucang. They reviewed Zhang Renjie's proposal to request the National Government to allocate funds to complete the capital street light installation within a specified period, Li Zonghuang's proposal that the construction of the capital should be based on the principles of simplicity, solemnity, and garden city, and that the capital plan should be completed within the shortest possible period, and that the land prices of private land requisitioned for Zhongshan Road should be repaid as soon as possible, and Liu Wendao's proposal on how to raise the huge capital construction funds.</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Preconditions of the Civil Code's Family and Inheritance Sections <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>▲ Hu Hanmin and Lin Sen requested the Central Political Committee to decide</p>
<p>The Civil Code Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan has successively completed the drafting of the General Principles, Obligations, and Property Rights sections, which were passed by the Yuan and promulgated by the National Government. It then began drafting the Family and Inheritance sections. However, these two sections are of great concern to the Kuomintang's party platform and local customs. If they are not carefully considered, their implementation will inevitably be inconsistent. Therefore, Yuan President Hu Hanmin and Lin Sen specifically submitted the points that should be decided first for these two laws to the Central Political Conference for decision. The Central Political Conference has handed them over to the Legal Group for review, which is currently underway. The original text of the points that Hu and Lin proposed should be decided first for these two sections is as follows:</p>
<p>"Regarding the proposal, all three sections of the Civil Code, the first section on General Principles, the second section on Obligations, and the third section on Property Rights, have been successively promulgated by the National Government. The fourth section on Family and the fifth section on Inheritance urgently need to be drafted to facilitate their application. However, these two sections on Family and Inheritance are of great concern to our party's platform and local customs. If they are not carefully considered, I am afraid there will be many inconsistencies. It is proposed that the committee first formulate principles and issue them to the Legislative Yuan to follow in drafting, to comply with the legislative procedures. The most controversial points in terms of legislative doctrine are submitted for preliminary decision, so that there is something to refer to when formulating principles. This is the proposal, please decide publicly. Proposers: Hu Hanmin, Lin Sen.</p>
<p>▲ Points to be decided first in Family Law: (1) How should relatives be classified and what should be their scope? According to the classification of relatives, in addition to husband and wife, our old law has traditionally divided them into three categories: clan relatives, maternal relatives, and wife's relatives. Relatives of the male lineage descended from the same ancestor are called clan relatives. Relatives connected by the female lineage are called maternal relatives. The relationship with the wife's natural relatives through marriage is called wife's relatives. However, foreign laws divide them into two categories: consanguineous relatives and affinal relatives. Relatives born of blood relationship are called consanguineous relatives. Relatives born of marital relationship are called affinal relatives. How should our Family Law be stipulated? This is the first point for preliminary decision. If blood and marriage are the criteria for classifying relatives, then the issue of surnames between husband and wife and children should also be resolved. How should our Family Law be stipulated? This is the second point for preliminary decision. Thinking about kinship from a natural point of view, the scope is extremely broad. If the number of generations is too distant, not only is it practically no different from non-relatives, but it is also unnecessary to recognize them as relatives in law. Therefore, the laws of various countries generally set certain limits to limit the scope of relatives. How should our Family Law be stipulated? This is the third point for preliminary decision.

<h3 id="e83">The Recent Trend of the War Situation in Guangxi Province <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>▲ Observations on Zhang Guijun Abandoning Guangxi to Enter Hunan and Attack Fuyang River</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The military situation in Guangxi has been quiet for the past month. Both sides have been making deployments and movements. Until recently, the tense situation in the Central Plains has also affected the war situation in the Southwest. Therefore, in recent days, the war situation in Guangxi Province has undergone new changes again. Currently, Zhang Guijun's movements are quite erratic. The Sixth and Eighth Armies can only proceed step by step and cannot penetrate deep into the interior of Guangxi Province. After Zhang's army retreated from Qinlian on the southern route of Guangdong Province to Yongchun and Hengxian along the Guangxi border, it gradually moved north with Li Zongren's and Tang Shengming's troops. It now seems to have concentrated in Guixian. At the same time, Huang Shaoxiong's troops in Guiping have also reportedly transferred a portion of their troops, appearing to bypass and attack along the Fuyang River. Therefore, Zhu Shaoliang's Sixth Army on the Dahe side cannot penetrate deep into Pingnan and Guiping. Currently, Mao Bingwen, Tan Daoyuan, and Xu Kexiang's units of the Sixth Army are concentrated between Tengxian and Mengjiang, with Zhu Weizhen and Zhou Xinming's newly formed Guangxi soldiers as vanguards and guides. As of the 6th of this month, the Sixth Route Army's vanguard only reached Dawuwei, 75 li above Mengjiang. This place is still 65 li away from Pingnan. On the surface, it appears that Zhu's Sixth Route Army is containing the enemy in Pingnan and Guiping, while the various divisions under Chen Jitang's First Route Army are attacking Guixian below Guiping, which is easier. Currently, Jiang Guangnai's division of the Eighth Route Army is pressing towards Guixian, and Li Deying's regiment of Lu Huan'yan's division advanced from Xingye to Qiaowei on the 6th (Qiaowei is 60 li from Guixian), serving as the vanguard. Cai Tingkai's division also continued to advance to Shanxinwei, the border between Xingye and Guixian. On the 8th, parts of Jiang and Cai's divisions had advanced to Putang and dispatched Qu Shounian's brigade of Cai's division to Xiawan to monitor the south bank of Guiping. The First Independent Regiment of the General Headquarters, led by Fan Dexing, joined the Pingnan line with the Sixth Route Army, and Li Yang's police division followed and advanced towards Xingye. As for Yu Hanmou and Xiang Hanping's divisions, they concentrated in Luwu in the Qinshu area of Guangdong Province to guard Yongchun on the Guangxi border. It is reported that Li Deying's regiment of Lu's vanguard in Xingye completed the river crossing on the 7th and pressed towards Sanpingluobowan, Guixian. However, the enemy in Guixian is still relying on the terrain to hold firm, and there has not been much contact between the two sides. In recent days, Zhang Guijun has not taken any active actions in Guixian and Guiping. According to a certain source yesterday, a part of Zhang Guijun's army in Guiping and Guixian retreated to Wuxuan on the 7th. Therefore, there are two speculations about Zhang Guijun's actions. One says that Zhang Guijun has been facing difficulties in logistics and has repeatedly failed to attack Guangdong. If this stalemate continues, it may lead to annihilation. Taking advantage of the current situation in the Central Plains, they may simply unite and lead their troops through southern Hunan to the Yangtze River to respond to Yan and Feng in order to find a way out. They will abandon the Guangxi territory and move their troops to Quanzhou. The retreat from Guiping in recent days may be to implement their plan to enter Hunan. Another says that Zhang Guijun's military operations have always been secretive. This time, they are shortening the defense line step by step, and the retreat from Guiping seems to be luring the Sixth and Eighth Routes of Dahe to penetrate deep into Guiping and Guixian, and then send heavy troops to attack Fuyang River and attack Wuzhou, cutting off the rear of the Sixth and Eighth Routes. According to recent investigations, only Huang Shaoxiong, Li Zongren, and Zhang Fakui's troops are in the Guiping and Guixian area. Bai Chongxi's whereabouts are unknown. It is suspected that Bai's troops are actually out of Zhaoping, peeping at Majiang and Cangwu. Therefore, in the Guixian area, the Eighth Route Army is only led by the Chief of Staff of the Eighth Army, who is based in Yulin, while the Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang is still sitting in Wuzhou. The above two theories both have considerable merit, and they are recorded here to await proof of the facts. (April 11)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Guangdong-Northern Jiang Communist Bandits Have Retreated to the Jiangxi Border <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>▲ Guangdong and Jiangxi Armies Are Currently Sending Troops to Encircle and Suppress the Jiangxi Border</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: After the Communist bandits Zhu and Peng sneaked into Nanxiong, Shixing, and Renhua counties on the Jiangxi border, they initially planned to attack Shaocheng from Shixing. Later, after learning that the provincial army's six regiments had deployed in Jilongwei and Zhoutian, they took the initiative to withdraw from Shixing and Nanxiong on the morning of the 8th. According to a source, the Communist bandits Zhu and Peng occupied Xiongshi for a total of seven days. There were no less than five or six thousand Communist bandits, led by Zhu De and Peng Dehuai. On the 1st of this month, they occupied Nanxiong from Dagen, on the 2nd they arrived in Gushi, on the 3rd they occupied Mashi, and on the 4th they entered Shixing. Wherever they went, plainclothes Communist bandits rose up to provide internal support, so the local militia and police were caught off guard. When the Communist bandits were in Xiong, they extorted no less than sixty to seventy thousand yuan from merchants and confiscated about twenty to thirty thousand yuan in public funds. At 5 p.m. on the 1st, the defending army retreated due to weakness. At 7 p.m., more than 100 Communist bandits first entered Xiong City. At 9 a.m. on the 2nd, a large number of Communist bandits began to enter the city to loot. The property of Wang Minglie, the head of the militia, was burned, and the county party headquarters was also burned. The Catholic Church in Goulong Lane in the city was dismantled, and Pipa Ridge, Shitang, Xiurenzai and other places were occasionally searched and looted. The flags used by the Communist bandits were disguised as the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag, and the soldiers' armbands were also like those of the party army. The clothing was quite neat, unlike the ragged clothes of those who flowed into Guangdong last year. The occupation of Shixing was led by the bandit leader Peng Dehuai, with about 4,000 people, several artillery pieces, water machine guns and hand grenades. They first extorted 100,000 yuan from the Shixing Chamber of Commerce. Since the Chamber of Commerce could not meet their demands, the Communist bandits searched house by house. Those who had grudges against them in peacetime were burned and killed. There were hundreds of propaganda teams among the Communist bandits, and there were also dozens of female propaganda teams. The slogans were mostly absurd. Until the 5th, the government troops launched a counterattack from Shao in two routes to Shixing and Renhua, and the Communist bandits decided to withdraw. On the 7th, they withdrew from Shixing and Renhua and concentrated in Nanxiong. On the same day, the Communist bandit propagandists gathered the public in Xiong City for an open-air lecture, saying that they would lead their troops to advance to Shaoguan, advising merchants to close their doors and suspend business, and that they could open their doors the next day. The merchants had to close their doors, and the road was deserted all day long. They were huddled at home, only hearing the sound of horns and the footsteps of troops moving. The next morning (the morning of the 8th), each family opened their doors, and indeed saw that all the Communist bandits had retreated. At first, they thought that the Communist bandits would attack Shaoguan, and if they were defeated and retreated to Xiong City, they would suffer. They were all on guard. Later, a husband and wife who had been recruited by the Communist bandits escaped. Curious people asked them what had happened. They said that they had been forced by the Communist bandits to carry their luggage to Dagen Ridge before finding an excuse to escape. Only then did the people of Xiong realize that the Communist bandits were feigning an attack on Shaoguan to carry out the deceitful plan of retreating to Jiangxi. After the Communist bandits withdrew, the Shaozhou Telegraph Bureau sent a telegram reporting that the Nanxiong telegram had been opened, that all the Communist bandits had completely withdrawn on the 7th, and that the order in the city was temporarily maintained by the reserve teams and that the place was safe. Wu Quan, the acting chairman of the Shixing Public Security Maintenance Association, also sent a telegram to the Eighth Route Army Headquarters and the Provincial Government, stating that, according to reliable reports, the Communist bandits who had retreated to Nanxiong had retreated from Nanxiong County City again on the morning of the 8th and fled to the Zhongzhan Dagen Ridge area, and that Nanxiong was now empty, and requested that troops be sent to maintain it, and ordered the army to track down and suppress the Communist bandits. After receiving the report, the Eighth Route Army Headquarters ordered Wu Wenxian, the commander of the Northern Jiang Bandit Suppression, to quickly send a team to maintain the security of Xiong City, and also telegraphed the Jiangxi Army to jointly encircle and suppress them. On the Guangdong side, in addition to Wu Wenxian leading six regiments to pursue Dagen Ridge, it also telegraphed Mao Weishou's Eighth Brigade in Meixian, Dongjiang, to block Longnan from Lianping. On the Jiangxi side, Division Commander Zhang Huizan also led Dai Yue, Zhu Yaohua, Cheng Guangyao, Tang Yunshan, Zhang Yuren, Deng Ying and other units to the south from Ji'an on the 5th, and launched a large-scale encirclement of the Communist bandits in southern Jiangxi.

<h3 id="e85">The Three Provincial Committee Members of Fujian Resigned <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Five Provincial Committee Members Have Not Been Released</p>
<p>▲ The Provincial Government Will Have No One in Charge</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: After the Provincial Governor Yang Shuzhuang went to Shanghai on March 12, the four department heads of Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction were also absent. For a time, the Fujian Provincial Government became a political situation with no governor and no department heads. All government affairs were maintained by the three members of the Provincial Committee, Chen Peikun, Jiang Pingfan, and Lin Jinan. Recently, the three members of Chen Jianglin felt the difficulty of the provincial capital's finances, which could not be dealt with, and were forced by the rampant bandits in western Fujian, with no troops to transfer. The arrested provincial committee members had no news of release, the reorganization of the provincial government had no realization period, and Yang Shuzhuang had no definite date to return to Fujian. It was difficult to shoulder this important task. Therefore, they jointly telegraphed the National Government to resign the day before yesterday, asking them to send someone to Fujian to take over as soon as possible, and telegraphed Yang Shuzhuang, stating that they could not be responsible and asked him to return to the province to preside over it as soon as possible. After sending the telegram, Chen Peikun also claimed illness and took his family to Yongquan Temple on Gushan Mountain to recuperate, to show his determination not to do it. The situation in Fujian has become more and more shaky. Fortunately, Chen Jiliang sent someone to Gushan to persuade him with all his might, and Chen returned to the province from the mountain yesterday, but his attitude was still negative and he had not yet entered the government to work. After receiving the resignation of the three provincial committee members, Yang Shuzhuang immediately replied to comfort them, saying that he would go to Beijing to discuss the affairs of Fujian with Chairman Jiang within a few days, and then return to the province. At the same time, he sent Jiang Zhizhuang, the director of the tobacco and alcohol tax bureau who had accompanied him to Shanghai last time, back to the province on the Hua'an ship on the 11th, to personally convey Yang's advice, saying that no matter what, he should maintain the current provincial government until the end, and not put the chairman (referring to Yang Shuzhuang) in a difficult position again. However, it is said that the central government delayed the reorganization of the Fujian Provincial Government for a long time, only wanting to release the arrested provincial committee members before issuing the announcement. Now it has changed its policy and decided to reorganize the provincial government first, and then solve the release issue. Considering the past situation in Fujian Province, the candidates for the provincial committee should be independent figures who have no relationship with the military forces in the province. It is also said that Lin Sen will be sent back to Fujian to preside over it. Therefore, the political circles are rumored that Lin will return to Fujian with Liu Tong and Ding Chao Wu within a few days, but whether it is true or not remains to be seen in future reports.

<h3 id="e86">Russian Troops on the Manchurian Border Opened Fire on Us <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>▲ Two Rounds Were Fired in One Day, Shells Landed in Our Streets. Harbin Communication: The actions of the Russian troops on the Manchurian border have recently contained provocative intentions. It is not uncommon for their national defense forces to enter our borders with the passage of the Eurasian Railway and to carry weapons to roam the streets. However, on the 9th of this month, they suddenly opened fire on our territory twice. The first time was at about 5 p.m. on the 9th, and the shell landed near the East Railway Factory of Manzhouli Station, blasting the ground into a round pit. Fortunately, no one was injured. The second time was at about 9 p.m. on the 9th, and the shell landed at the western end of Toudao Street, and no one was injured because it was late. The two artillery fire sounds were extremely loud, and the merchants and residents of Manzhouli Station were extremely panicked at that time. Fortunately, the military and police authorities maintained calm and did not cause trouble. At 10 p.m. that night, Zhao, the acting representative of the Hulunbuir Diplomatic Office stationed in Manzhouli Station, invited Toyota, the Japanese consul in Manzhouli Station, and many foreigners to the landing site of the shells to inspect the situation and collect the shell casings, and asked the Japanese consul and others to prove that the Russian side had indeed opened fire on us. At 12 p.m. on the 10th, Zhao again asked the Japanese consul Toyota to visit the Russian military commander at Small Station No. 86 and ask why he opened fire on the Chinese border. The Russian military commander gave evasive answers, and finally only said that he had not heard of this matter, but said that the shells fired in the past were not fired by the Russian army, and that this time it was probably not the Russian army either. Zhao also visited the Russian consul in Manzhouli Station, who said that it was probably a military exercise and that he would telegraph the commander to inform him not to aim the cannon at the Chinese border in the future. It has been found that the Russian army also opened fire on us once on the 6th of this month. One shell landed in Bazha City of Manzhouli Station. Together with the shells fired on the 9th, it has been three times, and its intentions are very unpredictable. Also, on the 6th of this month, the Russian side sent Luo Weichi (31 years old) and Ru Qi (44 years old) into our territory to spy on military and political news. These two Russians were the main leaders in destroying traffic, setting fires and demolishing roads during the East Railway Incident last year. Our side was eager to arrest them that day, so they fled back to their country. Now they have been ordered to come to China and were captured by our Manzhouli Station police. However, the next day, the Russian consul asked for them and gave them free travel passes. The two Russians were fearless and, according to reports, have been active along the Manchurian-Hainan border into our hinterland. As for the situation on the border, since the telegraphic rights were returned to the East Railway, the news has been very insensitive to the situation in Manchuria, Hainan, and Suimu. It is necessary to wait for people to tell the story, and it takes a long time. From this, it can be seen that the Russian side is trying to win the telegraphic rights. (April 11)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Discovery of a Counter-Revolutionary Suspect Case in Liaoning <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Since the occurrence of the Anti-Imperialist Grand Alliance in Harbin, and the smashing of the International Concord Newspaper, the Northeast authorities, in addition to ordering Harbin officials to take strict precautions, immediately placed the military police of the provincial capital under invisible martial law. Searches were intensified. During the memorial service for the fallen soldiers who died in the resistance against Russia on the 5th of this month, it was suspected that troublemakers would be active during it. Fortunately, security was tight and no trouble occurred. Afterwards, the military police authorities paid even more attention. They discovered that the Second Industrial School in Xiaoheyan had a complex mix of elements. They immediately implemented a search, arresting many students and some faculty members also voluntarily resigned. Currently, the school principal has been temporarily replaced by Inspector Gao Yangzhi of the Education Department, and classes are continuing as usual. On the evening of the 12th, the National Diplomacy Association held a popular lecture. That day, Lei Gan, the Director of the Detective Division of the Gendarmerie Headquarters, received a report from his agents stating that more than twenty people had secretly arrived in Liaoning from Harbin, intending to make a statement at the External Association's lecture on the 12th. Lei led over seventy plainclothes detectives, carrying weapons, to the venue for surveillance and prevention. Just as the speaker, Wang Jinchuan, took the stage, someone suddenly jumped onto a chair in front of the stage, shouting "Down with imperialism! Down with the new warlords!" and distributing leaflets of the Anti-Imperialist Grand Alliance. As the chairman was trying to stop him, the detective team suddenly arrived. Seeing the situation was not good, the person immediately fled, but was eventually captured by the detective team. When asked about his name, he said he was Zhao Zihe, 24 years old, from Harbin, and had come to Liaoning to find Liu Butong. A search of his person revealed no incriminating evidence. Two others were arrested at the same time: a student from Northeast University named Du Lanting, and a physical education student whose name is unknown. (April 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Head of the Haizhou Gang, Zhang Zhaohua, Has Been Captured <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The Yangcheng Lake bandit gangs have been routed by the bandit suppression forces in recent days. The faction led by Zhang Zhaohua of the notorious Haizhou Gang has been completely annihilated, rescuing a total of fifty or sixty hostages. The details have been reported in this newspaper repeatedly. Now, the news obtained today will be added as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Gangs Routed, Bandit Leader Captured. The Haizhou Gang was divided into two factions, one led by Mao Zilong, currently entrenched in the Maoqi Port area of Taihu Lake, and the other led by Zhang Zhaohua, a combination of the Si, Chen, and Haizhou gangs. After looting Zhangyan Town in Jinshan County on the first of this month, they fled into Yangcheng Lake. The bandit suppression army first routed them at the Sanyuan Dam in Chenmu, and they fled towards the Dayao Marsh in Chefang. On the 6th, they were scattered again by the troops stationed there. Zhang Zhaohua led his followers in an attempt to flee into Taihu Lake, but then, with no way to escape, returned to the Louzitou area of Yangcheng Lake. On the 11th, Xu Boying, the captain of the 11th Water Public Security Team, surrounded and suppressed them in three routes, scattering them again. At that time, Zhang Zhaohua wanted to abandon the gang and flee, but was stopped by the gang members. On the 12th, they retreated to the Lianhua Duo in Weiting Township, and the 2nd Battalion of the 28th Bandit Suppression Regiment completely annihilated Zhang's gang. Seeing the situation was unsustainable, Zhang Zhaohua led several bandits and fled into a cave in Weiting Mountain to hide. He was discovered by Fang Yue, the captain of the patrol team stationed there, who immediately ordered the two squad leaders, Pei Xuan, to lead the team to surround them. They fired shots as a threat. Seeing the situation was not good, Zhang fled for his life, but was hit by a bullet, which entered through his buttocks and he fell to the ground wounded. He was taken back to Suzhou by the soldiers. After a brief interrogation by Captain Fang, he claimed his name was Gao Zian, and that he was Zhang Zhaohua's staff officer. After Captain Fang recorded the statement, because the bandit was seriously injured, he was sent to Guangmin Hospital for treatment. Yesterday, Squad Leader Pei went to the hospital to identify him and confirmed that the bandit was Zhang Zhaohua. The reason was that Zhang's father had been a patrol officer in the guerrilla team, and Zhang had visited his father at the team headquarters, so he recognized his face.</p>
<p>▲ Chief of Military Law Interrogates the Bandit Leader. After Squad Leader Pei returned to the team, he reported to Captain Fang, who then reported to the general headquarters. After General Commander Hu reported the matter, he specially sent Chief Deng of the Military Law Department and Adjutant Liu, along with Huang Houchu, the principal of the Second County Elementary School of Zhangyan Town, who was a hostage, to Guangmin Hospital to interrogate Zhang Zhaohua. He claimed to be 26 years old, from Huaiyin, and had been a soldier, then joined Mao Zilong's group as chief of staff. He did not admit to being Zhang Zhaohua. Chief Deng immediately ordered Huang Houchu to identify him, and the prisoner was indeed Zhang Zhaohua. The reason was that when Huang was kidnapped, a small leader wanted to kill him, but Zhang stopped him, saying that their purpose was only money, not his life. At that time, the bandits all called the bandit "Master Zhang" and "Brigade Commander Zhang". After Chief Deng recorded Huang Houchu's statement, he determined that the prisoner was indeed Zhang Zhaohua, but his confession was cunning and his injuries had not yet healed. He ordered the county police team to send two policemen to Guangmin Hospital to guard him and prevent him from escaping.</p>
<p>▲ Twenty-Six Hostages Released on Bail. The large number of hostages rescued by the military police's bandit suppression efforts were escorted from Kunshan to Suzhou on the 15th. They were taken to the Taihu Bandit Suppression Headquarters, and after being interrogated by the Chief of the Military Law Department, it was confirmed that they were indeed kidnapped hostages. On the 16th, they were permitted to be released on bail by their families. Those who were bailed out included Huang Houchu, Zhang Zhaoying, Gu Shijie, Zhao Weiting, Huang Weijing, Wu Lejun, Zhang Siming, Xi Chengyuan, Tao Guokang, Zhang Shouyi, Xia Wu Shi, a Jin surname female, Xia Jinlong, Xia Jiming, Guo Gechen, Guo A Nan, Guo Linsheng, Guo Zhang Shi, Pan Shu Shi, Shen Wu Shi, Shen Jingying, Shen Jingfang, Zhu Guangxian, Zhu Yinxiang, Chen Yizhang, Fan Qirui, Jiang Weiqing, and twenty others.</p>

<p>▲ Zhong Yu Has Officially Notified the Russian Consul in Harbin</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Mo Dehui's trip to Russia is scheduled for May 1st. The convocation of the Sino-Russian conference will be around May 15th. Regarding the notification of the Sino-Russian conference, today (12th), Zhong Yu, the special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Harbin, personally delivered it to the Russian Consulate in Harbin at noon, handing it to the Russian Consul Melnikov in person. There were Chinese and Russian versions of the notification, and the content was very simple, roughly stating: "The Chinese government hereby appoints Mo Dehui, the Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, as the plenipotentiary representative for the Sino-Soviet Conference, scheduled to depart on May 1st to Moscow to convene the Sino-Soviet Conference. This is a notification, hoping that you will forward it to your government." The Russian Consul stated at the time that he would telegraph it to his country's government, and that a reply would arrive in Harbin in about a week, at which time he would forward it again. The notification took a lot of time to research and draft, partly because it was to prevent the Russian side from refusing to accept it, so the wording was carefully considered several times. On the morning of the 11th, the original text was telegraphed to the Northeast Political Committee, and after discussion, a reply was sent in the evening approving it. It was only sent out today. In addition to Li Chen of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tu Weizeng of the Ministry of Railways, and Sun Guangdou, a newly appointed consul in Shuangchengzi, who will serve as translators, the rest of Mo's entourage has not yet been decided.

<p>Cancellation of the Municipal Government Takeover.

<p>The Education Sector Suddenly Goes on Strike Again. The economic crisis in the Jiangdu education sector has been ongoing for some time. Acting Director Gu originally planned to distribute half a month's salary today (15th), but because the provincial government's 383rd meeting transferred Chen Da to succeed as director, the news spread, and Acting Director Gu no longer wanted to be responsible. The half-month salary that had already been raised was not paid out as scheduled. As a result, the general teachers and staff became greatly alarmed and petitioned the county government. County Magistrate Chen replied that before the new director takes office, all funding issues would still be the responsibility of the acting director. However, Acting Director Gu said that since someone has already been appointed to succeed him, his fundraising credit will no longer be effective, and he asked everyone for their understanding. Because the new director's appointment is indefinite, and the Acting Director is unwilling to take responsibility, the teachers and staff held a meeting at the public lecture hall today to discuss going on strike from tomorrow onwards. No matter who takes office as director, they will not resume classes unless one and a half months' salary is paid out. However, it is still unknown whether the new Director Chen, who is still in Gaoyou, will come immediately.</p>

<p>Robbery and Murder Case Occurs in a Busy Market. The Hengshunlong Money Shop on Dongmen Main Street, which exchanges silver dollars and banknotes, is opened by twin brothers Li Shouzhong and Shouhe. In September of last year, robbers robbed the shop, and Shouhe was shot to death with a handgun while resisting. The case has not been solved to this day. Unexpectedly, at 7 p.m. on the 9th, Shouzhong opened the iron cabinet and counted a large number of banknotes because a certain money shop had an agreement to exchange 4,000 yuan in banknotes on the 10th. At that time, eight robbers, each carrying a box gun, broke into the shop and grabbed the banknotes from the open iron cabinet. Shouzhong, unable to resist, withdrew and went outside, shouting to catch the robbers. The robbers who were acting as lookouts outside shot him twice in a row, hitting him in vital spots. He soon died. The robbers also fled in a crowd through Fuxing Lane. When Li's wife heard the alarm and came out to look, and reported it to the Merchant Corps to arrest them, they had already disappeared without a trace. After checking, it was estimated that 3,400 yuan in paper dollars had been robbed.</p>

<p>The year before last, I was abroad and therefore did not participate in the first conference. Those attending this session are all academic and educational experts. Therefore, my presence here allows me to express my simplest personal thoughts. My thoughts carry a sense of deliberation. Within the universe, time and space are limited, thus giving rise to various problems. In essence, these are merely different forms of A, B, C, D, etc. The limitations of time and space are exemplified in many historical instances. Taking China's recent education and knowledge into consideration, the state of education and knowledge thirty or forty years ago is vastly different from the state of education and knowledge today. Thirty or forty years ago, the thinking of 80% of the farmers was similar to the thinking of farmers today. However, in terms of education and knowledge, the difference between thirty or forty years ago and today is significant. Therefore, to promote education effectively, a relatively small number of people should take on the task of ensuring that 80% to 90% of farmers become literate, as a crucial endeavor. Since then, various cultural changes have led to the era of new culture and new education today. This so-called new era, based on various observations, analyses, and studies, is naturally different from the past. Generally, from a psychological perspective, people are pursuing novelty. One day, I was discussing Eastern and Western cultures with a friend, and we agreed that most Chinese people view Chinese culture as old and Western culture as new. In reality, there is no such thing as new or old; the only question is whether it is suitable. We do not expect Eastern culture to be transferred to the West, or Western culture to be transferred to the East. In terms of education, we must not simply transplant foreign systems and methods to our country without considering whether they are suitable for our national circumstances. Yesterday, Mr. Wu Zhihui raised the issue of writing. We can use this to explain the issue of Eastern and Western cultures. The world's writing systems have evolved from inconvenient to convenient ones. The evolution of Chinese writing is different. Chinese people strive for the beauty of their written characters. This mentality is more prevalent in our country than in foreign countries. Chinese writing is artistic, while Western writing emphasizes application. From this, we can understand the difference between Eastern and Western cultures. Some people genuinely advocate the romanization of Chinese characters. In fact, Chinese characters should not only not be abolished, but their unique strengths should be preserved. This is not about clinging to the old ways of the East, but because writing, besides being a tool for application and art, also involves historical issues. No other writing system in the world has been passed down for 5,000 years like Chinese characters. Therefore, the romanization of Chinese characters can be regarded as an auxiliary tool, but it should not be seen as the primary tool. Some believe that Chinese characters are difficult to learn and write. I believe that this situation is not a problem. In various countries around the world, farmers from wealthy families often own pianos to cultivate their emotional well-being. This is similar to the time spent by Chinese people in writing beautiful characters. We should not hastily regard Chinese characters as a difficult problem. Today, Eastern culture is being introduced to the West, and Western culture is being introduced to the East, leading to the emergence of a new culture. Neither Eastern culture nor Western culture will be eliminated. If there were only Western culture without Eastern culture, then this Western culture would become the culture of imperialism. There is also a social issue that can be discussed together. Recently, Chinese youth have believed that those who do not read Marxist books are backward. Little do they know that this ideology, which uses struggle as a means, is actually an old aspect of Western culture and is no match for the Three Principles of the People, which starts with love and is new.

<h3 id="e112">Minister Chiang's Report <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Minister Chiang reported that there would be two vice-chairmen of the assembly. One was the Vice-Minister of Education, Mr. Liu Dabai. However, due to Mr. Liu's illness, Mr. Chen Hexian, the Director of Education of Jiangsu Province, would be appointed as the vice-chairman instead. The other vice-chairman needed to be elected by the members. However, members from the central government and provinces closely affiliated with the central government should not be elected. It was best to elect representatives from remote areas to ensure broad representation.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Report from the Statistics Section Chief <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Chief of the Statistics Section stated that during the time of the University Council, they had compiled a general overview of national universities for the 16th year. The overview for the 17th year was more comprehensive. The overview of higher education was divided into three parts: universities, specialized schools, and studying abroad. Currently, the statistics for the university section had been printed and would be distributed to the members first. Other reports would be distributed after they were printed later. The Chief of the Elementary Education Section stated that the drafting of the plan had taken a significant amount of time. There were a total of eleven groups. Later, the group for Party Doctrine Education had not been drafted because the majority opinion was that this group's plan should be led by civil training. The Educational Administration Group had also not been drafted because educational administration was encompassed in various parts, so this type of plan was omitted. Although it had not been reviewed and approved by the central government, it could still be sent to the central government for approval after being discussed and decided by us. The administrative organs of the Educational Administration Group were missing from the problem plan itself. Therefore, it was appropriate to hold a large meeting during the conference for detailed discussion to achieve excellence and perfection. The concrete plan was too long, which might cause inconvenience for reference. Therefore, a summary was specifically printed for application during the review.</p>

Both in school administration and in public training, they rely on each other and cooperate with each other. The senior executives in charge of central education administration are very aware of this, and there is no need to elaborate.

In the early stage of political training, it is especially important. We should follow the comrades of the Central Training Department and strive to develop in the direction of people's livelihood, so that education can have good results. Taking agricultural education as an example, we should not only implement agricultural education training, but also promote it to the society to seek benefits for the people's livelihood. Furthermore, in the future, China's education should not only promote new knowledge, but also develop and promote old culture. Mr. Li Shizeng said at the conference today that old culture and new culture are not contradictory. No matter how Chinese education develops in new directions, old culture should be preserved for a considerable period of time. We are willing to make continuous efforts for Chinese education to respond to the warm hospitality of the Central Training Department and hope that you will give us your kind guidance. The dinner lasted for two hours, and the guests and hosts dispersed in joy.</p>

<p>(a) The provincial education funding for the 17th year of the Republic was more than 1.88 million yuan. In the 18th year, it increased to 2,630,532 yuan, an increase of more than 750,000 yuan. The percentages of each item in the total education funding are detailed below: (1) Elementary education funding accounts for 4%; (2) Secondary education funding accounts for 40%; (3) Higher education funding accounts for 13%; (4) Private school subsidies account for slightly more than 13%; (5) Social education funding accounts for 22%; (6) Overseas study funding accounts for 5%.</p>
<p>The provincial education administrative expenses are not included in the provincial education funding. Starting from the 18th year, the provincial government allocates 8,410 yuan per month, totaling approximately 100,928 yuan per year.</p>
<p>(b) Local education funding: The 69 counties in Hunan have a total of 5,484,450 yuan. Hunan Province has a total of 76 counties, and the reports from seven counties have not yet arrived, so they are not included. The estimated total amount of funding for each county should be more than 6,030,000 yuan. The highest is Changsha County with 420,000 yuan per year, Xiangtan with 380,000 yuan, and Xiangxiang with 300,000 yuan. The lowest is Tongdao County with only 6,000 yuan. The percentage of local education is as follows: A. Elementary education accounts for 71.70%; B. Secondary education accounts for 6.50%; C. Social education accounts for 3.48%; D. Education administrative expenses account for 13.89%; E. Others account for 5.04%.</p>
<p>2. Regarding the Situation of Primary School Education: Before the 16th year of the Republic, the majority of the education sector in Hunan Province was manipulated by the Communist Party. After the May 21 Incident, the authorities sought to eliminate the Communist Party and improve teacher quality, conducting examinations for primary school teachers. Since the 17th year, the affiliated primary schools of provincial schools have increased funding and improved the treatment of vocational education staff. Recently, efforts have been made to promote compulsory education, and a provincial compulsory education committee has been established in the province, and county compulsory education committees have been established in various counties to plan the implementation of compulsory education.</p>
<p>The survey of the number of schools in 60 counties, including Xiangtan, in the 17th year is as follows: (1) 11,967 junior primary schools; (2) 327 complete primary schools; (3) 282 senior primary schools; (4) 7 provincial affiliated primary schools (excluding kindergartens). The total number of schools is 12,583.</p>
<p>Expanding primary school funding is very difficult, and there are four reasons for this: (1) Previously, temple property could be allocated to education funding. Since the Ministry of Interior promulgated the Temple Custody Regulations, it has been impossible to allocate it. (2) The surtax on tobacco and alcohol was originally one of the sources of local education funding. Now, due to the Ministry of Finance's cancellation of this tax, the source has been greatly reduced. (3) Previously, each county could raise funds on its own. Now, the Ministry of Finance supervises local finances, and the Ministry of Finance representative Xu Shouzhi's restrictions are extremely strict, making it difficult to open up new sources of funding. (4) Among the old cases in various counties that have been approved and allocated to education funding, financial institutions often consider them to be exorbitant taxes and fees and cancel them. Judging from the above four points, increasing education funding requires the formulation of new regulations and increasing the people's productive capacity. According to precedents in various countries, the popularization of compulsory education requires the state to raise large sums of money for subsidies. This is a practice that can be adopted.</p>
<p>3. Vocational Education: The Provincial First Vocational School, the First Agricultural School, the First Industrial School, and the Provincial First Women's Vocational School are all located in Changsha. The Second Vocational School is located in Changde, the Third Vocational School is located in Hengzhou, the Fourth Vocational School is located in Shaoyang, the Sixth Vocational School is located in Zhijiang, and the Eighth Vocational School is located in Guiyang. The separate establishment of vocational schools in various counties is to promote the balanced development of education in various counties. There are 17 private vocational schools in Changsha, 12 of which receive subsidies from the province. There are 15 county-run vocational schools in various counties. There are a total of 44 vocational schools in the province. 4. Normal Education: The Provincial First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Middle Schools all have senior high school normal departments. The Provincial First Agricultural School has an attached rural normal school, which started in the spring of the 18th year. The First Men's Normal School is located in Changsha, and the school building for the Provincial First Women's Normal School is under construction. The Faculty of Arts of Hunan University also has an education department, which is an institution for training teachers for secondary schools. There are 35 county-run normal schools in various counties throughout the province.</p>
<p>4. Secondary Education: The Provincial First to Sixth Middle Schools (three for boys and three for girls) are coeducational and have senior and junior levels. The First Middle School (boys) and the Second Middle School (girls) are located in Changsha, the Third Middle School (boys) is located in Changde, the Fourth Middle School (girls) is located in Taoyuan, and the Fifth Middle School (boys) and the Sixth Middle School (girls) are located in Hengzhou. There are seven middle schools jointly established by several counties. Since last year, they have all received subsidies from the province, which is also intended to promote the balanced development of education. There are 25 independently established county-run middle schools (without provincial subsidies). Compared to the two, the joint county middle schools are better run. There are 24 private middle schools that receive provincial subsidies and 15 that do not receive provincial subsidies. There are a total of 78 middle schools in the province.</p>
<p>5. Higher Education: Hunan University is a provincial university formed by the merger of high-level engineering, agriculture, and commerce colleges. It was established during the Zhao Hengti era and was once suspended and renamed Zhongshan University. It is now still named Hunan University and has three colleges of arts, science, and engineering, as well as a preparatory course. The monthly funding was more than 16,000 yuan in the 17th year and more than 18,000 yuan in the 18th year. There is also an additional temporary fee of 10,000 yuan per month. Although the school's expenses are small, it has produced many talents. Many serve outside the province, but not so many serve in the province. Efforts are now being made to expand facilities and enrich content. The library is under construction, and instruments and books are also being added. By the 19th year, the annual temporary fee can reach 200,000 yuan, and the regular expenses can also exceed 20,000 yuan. The future of Hunan University has promising prospects. In addition, there are three private universities that have not yet been registered with the Ministry of Education: Qunzhi Political Science and Law University, Jianguo Political Science and Law University, and Medical University.</p>
<p>6. Social Education: The province has established a provincial popular education committee, which publishes many popular education publications. There is a provincial popular education hall, a museum, and the Zhongshan Library. Each county also has a popular education committee, which is in charge of popular education matters throughout the county. Recently, the province has built a new public sports field and spent more than 100,000 yuan to build a Zhongshan Hall for public lectures. There are 31 popular education halls, 18 lecture halls, 86 libraries, 23 newspaper reading rooms, 346 people's schools, and 17 poor people's handicraft factories throughout the province.</p>
<p>7. Characteristics of Hunan Education: (A) Open funding: The province has been able to fully achieve this. To build a clean government, we should start with the education sector. Since the 17th year, there have been no delays in payments. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, the temporary fees issued in the 18th year of the Republic have been the most. The open method is that the provincial education department organizes an economic audit committee to review the accounts of the department and publishes them once a month. A funding management committee is established throughout the province, with seven or eight representatives publicly elected by the education sector throughout the province as members, responsible for auditing the expenditures and income of the provincial education funding, which is also published once a month. The interest of 7,000 to 8,000 yuan is entirely for public use. The accounting directors of provincial schools are directly appointed by the education department, and the principals can only supervise them. Each school also organizes an audit committee, which is also responsible for supervising the accounting director. The education department, the finance department, and the Hunan audit committee also audit them. Under this kind of joint supervision, the accounting director absolutely does not commit fraud. The continuous disputes in the education sector of other provinces, the lack of open funding, is the biggest reason. Hunan has overcome various difficulties to achieve the goal of having the department appoint accounting directors. (B) Balanced development of education throughout the province: Provincial schools can be distributed to remote counties, and the joint middle schools receive provincial subsidies, which is also one way to promote the balanced development of education throughout the province. The salaries of the education bureau directors of various counties are directly paid by the province on a monthly basis, not from county funds. For counties where the education funding is less than 15,000 yuan, the province subsidizes 60 yuan per month. The purpose is also to promote the balanced development of education in the province. (C) Establishment of libraries in various counties: In the first half of last year, there were very few libraries in the province. In the winter, the education department ordered each county to establish a public library within three months. All counties were able to comply. There are now 86 libraries throughout the province.</p>

<h3 id="e130">The Process of Drafting the Plan for Improving Social Education and Its Main Points - Chen Jianxiao <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Generally speaking, this plan includes: (1) planning vocational supplementary education for agriculture, industry, and commerce; (2) preparing for the establishment of various major social education institutions (such as public theaters, public sports fields, public libraries, museums, and art galleries); (3) promoting special education and reformatory education; (4) improving customs and promoting public entertainment methods; (5) stipulating cooperative methods for social education and school education; and (6) an outline for implementing this plan. The original assumed program items varied greatly in detail. The original specified items were: (1) determining the implementation goals and methods of social education; (2) planning vocational supplementary education for agriculture, industry, and commerce (such as working with the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines to vigorously promote agricultural extension services); (3) promoting and encouraging art education and planning and establishing central and provincial music and art museums; (4) planning the establishment of central and provincial libraries and compiling various supplementary reading materials, popular readings, and general materials; (5) preparing for the establishment of central and provincial museums and formulating concrete measures for preserving documents and antiquities; (6) promoting public sports and implementing the Physical Education Law promulgated by the National Government; (7) planning special education for the mentally and physically challenged, and reformatory education for criminals; (8) planning for the improvement of customs and public entertainment matters (such as improving opera, storytelling, shadow puppetry, and establishing model theaters and public tea houses) and methods for supervising and guiding social education institutions established by public and private organizations; (9) drafting "National Independence Movement Education" methods from the perspective of social education; (10) stipulating matters related to social education and school education (such as setting up social education institutions attached to rural primary schools); (11) drafting types and procedures for civic education and public training. Its classification should be the same as originally planned, or even more detailed, because there were not many drafts provided by the invited drafting experts, and the level of detail varied. Later, it was revised several times casually, so it became very uncertain. This is what I feel very sorry about when describing the drafting process. This plan does not include: (1) civic education such as party ideology training; (2) public education such as public supplementary schools. These are also worth noting. However, public education has already been published in the Adult Supplementary Education Plan. Party ideology education and company education were initially assigned to the Party Ideology Education Group, although it was not expected that this group would not be established in the end.</p>
<p>In general, party ideology propaganda, political training, and the cultivation of citizens' exercise of four rights were originally placed within the scope of social education. Therefore, four years ago, Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou established a Political Training Committee. The first section of the Social Education Department within the Graduate School the year before last seemed to be the Social Education Section outside of schools, in charge of the Three Principles of the People education, etc. Now, higher-level schools still have Moral Education Committees. These all recognize social education as education for cultivating healthy citizens, completely eliminating the concept that social education is somewhat empty and impractical in the eyes of ordinary people. This has had a very good influence. However, since the discussion about education being entirely based on the Three Principles of the People, it seems that we should not fragmentedly talk about party ideology and politics. We must dissolve them into curriculum materials and moral education, to prevent people from studying party ideology like studying "Party Eight-legged Essays." Only then can we separate party ideology education, etc., from social education.</p>
<p>As for public education, it has been mixed up with social education from the beginning, so it is still difficult to explain them clearly. Although these two types of education are the same in nature, they differ in quality due to the size of their scope. They are absolutely not to be confused. Public education targets individual members of the public. In very popular terms, it uses a method to make the illiterate literate and to provide those without knowledge and skills with general knowledge and living skills. Social education, however, has different circumstances. It often pays attention to general social culture and academics, as well as public customs and habits. It targets not only individual members of the public but also the entire society. Naturally, its scope is very large. It can take into account all aspects of the public's moral, intellectual, aesthetic, and physical education. The main parts of public education are public schools and adult vocational supplementary schools. Therefore, public education is also a formal form of social education. However, this plan does not include public education because there is another adult supplementary education plan at the same time.</p>
<p>The above is the historical evolution of the expansion and contraction of the scope of social education. This plan is also based on this process.</p>
<p>Drafting this plan was similar to drafting other education plans. Initially, the Ministry of Education, based on the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee, established the Education Program Drafting Committee, which set up a Social Education Group. It hired Gao Yang, Tang Maoru, Chen Yangzao, Liu Zhanen, Zhu Maocheng, Fu Ruoyu, and me, a total of seven people, as expert committee members. It also invited Chang Daozhi, Sun Shaobo, Zhu Chongtao, Yu Youren, Yun, and Gu Shaoyi to draft specific items. As drafts from various parties were sent in one after another, some were detailed, some were brief, and some were missing without any drafts. Because of my position in the Ministry of Education, I also served as the director of this group. I carefully organized and sorted them out, made them separately, and then the program committee added, deleted, and revised them before they were completed. Then, the Ministry of Education combined it with other plans for implementing or improving education, calling it the "National Education Improvement Program," and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government, which sent it to the Central Political Conference for review. Only then could it be sent to the National Education Conference for discussion. The procedure of so many twists and turns and meetings and reviews cannot be said to be not meticulous and thorough. However, some places wasted precious time discussing trivial issues, and sometimes discarded many valuable or even necessary materials because they disliked the plan's content being too rich and the length being too long. It is true that there were unavoidable circumstances, but I still think it is a pity. For example, the item of planning special education for the mentally and physically challenged and reformatory education for criminals was later changed by the program drafting committee to planning methods for setting up special education and reformatory education, removing the mentally and physically challenged and adding delinquent children or youths. As for the methods of reforming criminals, it is now stipulated that the Ministry of Education should first set up a testing and research office to test the psychology of criminals, and then organize a research committee on reformatory education courses to determine curriculum standards. In each province, the education department should also cooperate with the provincial court to conduct trials in the provincial prisons, and then gradually promote it to various cities and counties. This is much simpler and less detailed than the initial plan. Initially, Mr. Zhu Chongtao saw in the newspaper that the Ministry of Education had organized an education program drafting committee divided into eleven groups, and that blind, deaf, and disabled education was uniquely missing, and he argued fiercely. He wrote an initial draft of a program for blind, deaf, and disabled education in China, arguing that blind, deaf, and disabled education should deserve special attention from educators, and listed it as a unit in the education program. He also argued that in terms of laws and regulations, attention should be paid to (1) determining the status of blind, deaf, and disabled education in educational administration; (2) Zhou Gengsheng, representative of Wuhan University on the left, and Huang Jianzhong, Director of the Hubei Education Department on the right; the goal of blind, deaf, and disabled education; (3) how the blind, deaf, and disabled school system should be formulated; (4) the curriculum issues of blind, deaf, and disabled schools; and in terms of implementation, pay attention to (1) the estimation of the number of blind, deaf, and disabled children nationwide; (2) the funding issues of blind, deaf, and disabled education; (3) the training of teachers; (4) the steps to promote blind, deaf, and disabled education. Also, Mr. Yu Youren's submitted program for blind, deaf, and disabled education also planned the goals of blind, deaf, and disabled education, teaching methods, moral education standards, and methods for promoting blind, deaf, and disabled education in great detail. Unfortunately, due to limited space, it was not included in this plan. Fortunately, these proposals mostly belong to practical implementation aspects, and in the future, it will not hurt to have the local design test and promote them.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also (1) methods for improving customs and promoting public entertainment and (2) drafting national independence movement education from the perspective of social education. The latter method was drafted according to the intention of the Central Training Department. From the standpoint of nationalism, using educational methods to teach the public and youth to understand the situation of our country being oppressed by foreign imperialists, to invigorate and strive for China's freedom and equality. Its method also starts from using lyrics and novels, etc., and has many similarities with the former method of improving customs and promoting public entertainment. The former method is relatively detailed, its purpose is to promote beautiful social customs, cultivate good public habits, reform old social bad habits, implement a happy and harmonious life for the people, and promote the noble and great spirit of the nation. Its methods for implementing the improvement of customs are divided into two types: passive and active. The passive one is to try to ban or prohibit the old bad habits and businesses that harm customs. The active one is to promote proper public entertainment. From the latter point of view, it can be said that to improve customs, it is necessary to promote proper public entertainment. On the other hand, if the public gets proper entertainment, customs will naturally be improved. The two are interrelated and cannot be separated. As for their implementation procedures, they are nothing more than several types of registration, training, review, punishment, or promotion and reward. However, these two methods were also not fully incorporated into this plan. Now, looking back on the process of drafting this plan, it is inevitable to feel that it is biased and incomplete, lacking in substance. When we draft and discuss plans, it is best to discuss the part that the plan itself can develop, and do not forcibly add a restriction from the outside. This restriction is not only useless for discussion, but also very easy to become an obstacle, hindering the advantages of the plan. Moreover, it is also unreasonable to regard social education as a side business, not as important as school education.</p>
<p>Now let me briefly mention a few points for discussion, so that it can be known where the simplicity, incompleteness, and regrets are. For example, the first part of this plan was to determine the goals and implementation methods of social education. Gao, Tang, Chang, and Sun provided materials and drafts. Its most brilliant point is that it is advocated that the goals of implementing social education should be determined according to our country's education purposes and its implementation guidelines. Our country's education purposes state that the education of the Republic of China is based on the Three Principles of the People, with the goal of enriching people's lives, supporting social survival, developing national livelihoods, and continuing national life, striving for national independence, universal civil rights, and the development of people's livelihood, to promote world harmony. The third item of its implementation guidelines states that social education must equip everyone with common sense of modern urban and rural life, skills to improve family economics, qualifications necessary for civil autonomy, habits of protecting public undertakings and forests and gardens, and the virtues of supporting the elderly, caring for the poor, preventing disasters, and helping each other. The seventh item states that schools at all levels and social education should pay equal attention to the development of national physical education. If the above-mentioned education purposes and their implementation guidelines are analyzed, they will become the following two tables:</p>
<p>Education Purposes</p>
<p>Supporting social survival and continuing national life: Social aspect</p>
<p>Developing national livelihoods and enriching people's lives: Individual aspect</p>
<p>World Harmony and National Independence: Social aspect</p>
<p>Universal Civil Rights and the Development of People's Livelihood: Individual aspect</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines</p>
<p>Common sense of modern urban and rural life, skills to improve family life, development of national physical education, qualifications necessary for civil autonomy | Individual aspect</p>
<p>Habits of protecting public undertakings and forests and gardens</p>
<p>Looking at the above two tables, it can be seen that social education should take into account both the individual and society. From the individual's point of view, social education should enable each member of society to have continuous growth, regardless of gender, age, or level of education. In terms of knowledge, ability, spirit, and body, they should all have opportunities to continuously strive for improvement at any time. Therefore, national livelihoods can be developed and people's lives can be enriched. From the social aspect, social education should make each member of society a responsible, healthy, and productive citizen. Therefore, national life can be supported. Therefore, social education is divided into civic (i.e., national) education, livelihood education, art education, and health education. The educational goals of these items are listed in detail according to the above two tables, and a practical outline is first stated, from the outline to the details. The description and breakdown are very detailed, but later there was no chance to compile it into the plan.</p>
<p>Now, what remains of this plan and includes the important parts is another very simple summary of the plan. People who want to study the content of this plan or participate in this national conference and want to glimpse the full text but do not have the time can first look at that summary and use it as a stepping stone. Therefore, there is no need to say anything about key points or non-key points here. However, as far as this remaining plan is concerned, there are several implementation principles inside, such as (A) administrative organization should be simple, (B) various implementation agencies should be centralized, (C) implementation procedures should be tested first and then promoted, (D) implementation talents should be specially trained, (E) social education funds should be broadly raised and their independence should be guaranteed, (F) the government should guide society and use all its strength to promote social education. These are very important. The rest are mostly using these principles to solve various implementation problems. In addition, the classification of vocational supplementary schools, the annual preparation and promotion of public theaters, public education fields, public libraries, public museums and art galleries, and art exhibitions, as well as the cooperative and division of labor methods between social education and school education, are all the essence of this plan. In short, this plan has the above-mentioned process, making this plan seem to be pieced together bit by bit, and the spirit is not completely consistent and systematic from beginning to end. I hope that the education colleagues attending the meeting will not hesitate to add to and correct it.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Meeting Rules of Procedure <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>First, Section Chief Wu Yanyin read out the original text of the rules of procedure. Minister Jiang stated that these rules are based on the "Essentials of People's Rights". However, the reason why the opinion of the minority was attached to Article 17 was for reference when submitting it to the Central Government. Later, member No. 98 proposed a temporary motion of attending members, asking whether it could be changed to one-fifth or two-sixths. Xu Rongguang advocated for ten attending members. Zhu Jingnong said that if it is outside the scope of the program, the restrictions should be strict. Within the scope, ten people should not be determined. Zhao Naichuan said that the temporary motion of this proposal should be restricted to one-fourth of the attending members, not the number of registered members. Please pay attention to everyone. At this time, the chairman put it to a vote, saying that those who advocated maintaining the original proposal, please raise your hand. Forty-one votes were obtained. As a result, it was a minority. At the same time, Mr. Chen Bulei proposed that the endorsement of more than ten members present at the meeting should be a temporary motion, which received forty-nine votes and was passed by a majority.</p>
<p>For the draft of Article 10, Zhang Mojun advocated that the number of speeches per person for the same proposal should be changed to no more than three times, which received twenty-three votes and was not passed.</p>

<p>Wu Yanyin still read out the review rules item by item first. Xiong Changfei proposed that Article 2 should be revised: "The members of each review committee shall be appointed by the chairman from among the members and submitted to the conference for approval." The following text should be deleted. Zhu Jingnong advocated that specialized committee members and responsible section chiefs should be allowed to attend and make statements, but not participate in the discussion. Zhang Mojun advocated that the review committee members should be determined by themselves, and the specialized committee members and responsible section chiefs should be allowed to attend the review. Zhu Jingnong advocated maintaining the method of the review committee members being appointed by the chairman. He agreed with the second half of Zhang Mojun and Yu Qingtang's proposal: "The members of each review committee shall be appointed by the chairman from among the members and reported to the conference for approval." The final decision was still maintained.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Educational Opinion Paper (3) - Gao Junshan <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>(5) The abilities of gifted children far exceed those of ordinary children. Ordinary teaching materials and methods are not only insufficient to make them work hard but also cannot arouse their interest. As a result, they will inevitably become disgusted with school life. However, if they are taught in separate classes, materials suitable for their abilities can be used. In this way, not only can their interest in learning be increased, but also the years of schooling can be shortened and the content of the curriculum can be enriched. Naturally, the results will be more considerable, and time and money will be more economical.</p>
<p>(6) Children with low intelligence can only deal with simpler and more concrete things. If the newly determined teaching materials can be adapted to the degree of their intelligence, then their academic performance will certainly be very good. They can use a skill to support themselves. This will reduce the burden on the family and increase social efficiency.</p>
<p>(7) Gifted children are the pioneers in future academics and the backbone of society. If no measures are taken to stimulate their abilities, they will inevitably spend their lives without any achievements due to the lack of opportunities for full development, or they will be contaminated by bad habits in the environment and fall. Now, if we can discover real gifted children and educate them, we will definitely be able to improve our country's position in the world of academics in the future, and with ideal leaders, we will definitely be able to realistically create happiness for the masses.</p>
<p>(2) Methods</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Education should hire education experts to jointly formulate special and detailed methods. After implementation, if shortcomings are found, they should be revised at any time.</p>
<p>(2) Schools at all levels should establish special classes for children with low intelligence or gifted children, depending on their talent equipment and economic capabilities.</p>
<p>(3) Refer to the achievements and methods of special education in Europe and the United States for reference.</p>
<p>(4) Each school should report the results and difficulties of the pilot program at any time for everyone's learning and research.</p>
<p>▲ Proposal to Stipulate Standards for Publicly Funded Students</p>
<p>(1) Reasons</p>
<p>(1) The history of our country sending students to study abroad has been very long. However, there has never been a fixed standard for the amount of public funds. Even when studying in the same country, there are differences in the amount. Because the standard is not fixed, there is nothing to follow. We have to listen to the free distribution of various agencies. In this way, the same publicly funded students also have phenomena of prosperity and decline.</p>
<p>(2) The units of public funds used in the past were also very inconsistent. Some used domestic silver coins as the unit (such as most provincial funds), and some used gold coins of the study abroad country as the unit (such as tuition fees of Tsinghua University). The price of gold fluctuates from time to time. Those using national currency as the unit have monthly tuition fees that increase or decrease accordingly.</p>
<p>(3) The amount of public funds is almost always based on past practices, without paying attention to the changes in the cost of living in the study abroad country. Therefore, the amount set ten years ago is still being used to this day, without knowing that the cost of living has increased a lot. Furthermore, in the past year or two, the price of gold has risen daily, which has invisibly reduced tuition fees in order to maintain the increased cost of living.</p>
<p>(2) Methods</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Education should hire people familiar with the situation of various countries to formulate a unified standard for public funds according to the current living conditions of each country so that the sending agencies have something to follow.</p>
<p>(2) At the same time, make a form and send it to the consulates and embassies of various countries, asking them to forward it to students studying abroad, people working and living abroad, and business people to investigate their cost of living. The materials collected can be used as a reference for setting standards.</p>
<p>(3) The unit of public funds should be the national currency of the study abroad country (such as francs in France and US dollars in the United States).</p>
<p>(4) Pay attention to changes in the cost of living. A new standard should be re-established every so often.</p>
<p>(5) Pay attention to the subjects studied. If necessary, issue some special funds to show fairness (such as the experimental fees for those studying natural sciences and the music fees for those studying music, etc.).</p>
<p>▲ Please the Ministry of Education to Limit the Dispatch of Students from Provinces and Institutions with Difficulties in Educational Funding to Study Abroad and How to Improve Later Cases</p>
<p>(1) Reasons</p>
<p>(1) Student tuition fees actually include tuition, food, clothing, housing, and pocket money. Once a problem occurs, not only can they not study, but they also find it difficult to maintain their lives. Students from slightly wealthy families can still be barely supported by their families. If the family is poor, they want to return to their country, but they have no money for the trip and have to sit and wait for death.</p>
<p>(2) People who cannot receive tuition fees on a monthly basis or often do not receive tuition fees for several months, assuming that their parents cannot support them and there is no other source of subsidy, most of them are in this situation. They have no choice but to look for work. People who cannot find work are hindered in their studies on the one hand and restricted by the study abroad country on the other hand. For example, the US government prohibits students from working. How painful and inconvenient!</p>
<p>(3) Hardworking students work on the one hand and still choose to study the prescribed courses on the other hand. As a result, their health will inevitably be damaged. This is not the meaning of the country cultivating talents.</p>
<p>(4) People with a weaker will will inevitably fall into a pessimistic situation.</p>
<p>(2) Methods</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Education should issue an order to all provinces and institutions that unless the educational funds are certain, do not send students to study abroad.</p>
<p>(2) After sending them, tuition fees must be pre-remitted on a monthly (or quarterly) basis, based on the date of receipt, and must not be overdue.</p>
<p>(3) Provinces or institutions with certain funds, if there is an unexpected problem, should try their best to maintain the public funds of the students who have been sent abroad.</p>
<p>▲ Teachers and Students of Universities, Middle Schools, and Primary Schools Should Wear Domestic Clothes and Use Domestic Materials</p>
<p>(1) Reasons</p>
<p>(1) At this time of expensive gold and silver, the loss of using foreign goods is even more alarming. Not wearing Western clothes is a very effective way to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. The materials for Western clothes are all wool fabrics, and most of the wool fabrics are imported from abroad. On the one hand, we suffer the loss of buying foreign goods with heavy money, and on the other hand, it is enough to hinder the development of domestic goods. Clothing is a daily necessity that cannot be lacking for a moment. Compared with the consumption of all educational supplies, such as stationery, instruments, and chemical medicines, the cost is much greater. Therefore, if people in the education sector can use domestic goods to make domestic clothes, it is a kind of relief for the country's finances.</p>
<p>(2) Every country has its own special fashion that cannot be forced to be the same. A country's clothing is the most prominent representative of a country and is also an expression of national characteristics. We should preserve the colors of our country and not imitate the fashion of other countries. Then we can promote the inherent spirit of the nation and arouse the concept of national unity. Unless it is a conquered country, its language, customs, etiquette, and clothing should not completely imitate the people of other countries.</p>
<p>(3) The cost of Western clothes is greater than that of Chinese clothes. Even the lowest materials are more expensive than Chinese clothes. Education is a poor profession, and the income of teachers and staff in middle and primary schools is particularly limited. If the price of Western clothes takes up a large part of their budget, is it not a very uneconomical thing? As for the students, it is giving their parents a heavier burden. It is not easy for middle-class families to send their sons to middle school or university. Adding the consumption of clothing is enough to hinder the opportunity of going to higher education. Isn't it penny wise, pound foolish?</p>

<p>▲Proclamation to the Public by the Headquarters</p>
<p>(1) To demonstrate the sound spirit of the nation.</p>
<p>(2) To promote the physical training of the people.</p>
<p>(3) To fully develop the five areas of intelligence.</p>
<p>(4) To deeply recognize the leadership of this Party.</p>
<p>The Headquarters of the Boy Scouts of China, in order to hold the first National Scout General Inspection, has issued a proclamation to the public. It first states that the holding of this Boy Scout General Inspection marks a new era in the history of Boy Scouts in our country. We deeply feel that this year is the most important and valuable period in the history of the development of Boy Scouts in China, as the sound spirit of the nation is demonstrated and the physical training of the people is promoted. We sincerely hope that all compatriots in the country will pay full attention. Next, it discusses the origin of the Boy Scouts, which was first founded by the Englishman Baden-Powell, and the evolution of Boy Scouts in China. Finally, it states that the Boy Scouts under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang bear the responsibility of realizing the Three Principles of the People, completing the Chinese National Revolution and building a new country of the people, by the people, and for the people. Today, most young people in China are decadent in their aspirations and weak in their bodies, truly exhibiting the spirit of the "sick man of the East," so the national spirit is almost exhausted. The Party's Boy Scouts must have a firm and clear national consciousness to maintain and promote the spirit and culture of their own nation, and must fully develop the five aspects of morality, intelligence, social skills, aesthetics, and physical education, in order to exercise civil rights and fulfill all other national obligations. Furthermore, they must have production and technical training, cultivate the habit of loving and using domestic goods, promote production, and support the development of people's livelihood. It also states that the purpose of this general inspection is to demonstrate the achievements of the training of each Boy Scout group, to encourage the good ones, and to find ways to improve the deficient ones. The Boy Scouts from various provinces and cities are gathered in the capital not only to connect the friendship between the Boy Scouts, but also to enable Boy Scouts from all places to have a deeper understanding of the significance of the Party's leadership. We also hope that all sectors of society will have a correct understanding of the Boy Scouts under the guidance of the Party, unite together, and promote the development of the Boy Scout cause in China.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute has recently paid close attention to the升學方面 for students in various schools who are about to graduate. It is currently conducting an on-site investigation of the content of secondary and higher education schools, and plans to compile a book entitled "Guidance for Further Education" to provide a reference for further education for young people in this city and other places. The institute has also been entrusted by the famous Rixin Banliangzhou Factory in Shanghai to recruit more than ten trainees. Graduates of junior high schools who are extremely healthy, able to endure hardship, meticulous, and quick-witted are qualified. The regulations are currently being drafted. A certain industrial education institution in Hangzhou is seeking to introduce a female physical education teacher and a female grade teacher, both of whom are physically strong and enthusiastic in service, with a monthly salary of about 30 yuan. In addition, a qualified industrial institution entrusted the recruitment of a person who is familiar with Japanese and proficient in documents and accounting. Furthermore, a certain county public security bureau belongs to a special police officer教官 one person以富於警察學識 or qualified for those who have researched in Japan.

<h3 id="e144">News of Our Country's Preparation for the Far Eastern Games <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Our country is actively preparing for the 9th Far Eastern Games, sparing no effort. The other day, the National Sports Federation held a standing committee meeting and decided on all important plans. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Here is the latest news:</p>
<p>(1) Applying for Public Leave</p>
<p>The selected representatives will organize a training institute and hire experts to serve as instructors. The instructors are currently being sought. The Sports Federation will apply for public leave on their behalf.</p>
<p>(2) Telegram to Overseas Athletes</p>
<p>Due to the lack of talent in the country, it is necessary to recruit athletes from overseas Chinese communities. For example, the Honolulu Chinese baseball team has sufficient strength and has agreed to return to the country to serve. The association sent a telegram to the Singapore Chinese Sports Organizations yesterday, inviting tennis star Lin Wangsu and the five best swimmers, whose travel expenses will be provided by the association. They will depart for Japan with all the athletes in the future.</p>
<p>(3) Arrangement of the Training Institute</p>
<p>The men's training institute has leased a three-story Western-style house at 190 Sabu Road, which is quite elegant. The rooms inside are all numbered, and there are also coaching rooms, management rooms, and hearing rooms. Each floor has a fixed number of servants to take care of everything.</p>
<p>(4) Purchasing a Large Number of Documents</p>
<p>Most of the selected representatives are students. From participating in each district's preliminary election meeting to the National Games, and then to Japan, it takes several months of time, which prevents them from studying and greatly hinders their academic work. In order to remedy this, the association has not only hired experts to give lectures, but has also purchased a large number of Chinese and Western documents and distributed them to both male and female departments to facilitate the athletes' research.</p>

<p>Chinese Director Yuan Ludeng</p>
<p>▲ Representatives Present A total of 81 representatives belong to the association. Yesterday, 59 representatives attended, as follows: Zhang Yichen, Shen Bokui, Yu Xiji, Chu Jiqing, Zhang Rulin, Chen Yizhou (represented by Xu Jiqing), Cao Rangzhi, Yan E'sheng, Hu Fengxiang, Li Fuxun (represented by Hu Fengxiang), Li Bohan, Shen Tianxin, Chu Huiseng, Jiang Yiping, Jiang Yinan, Qian Longzhang, Wang Jie'an, Wu Yaqin, Chu Yunan, Zhang Yichen, Shi Zhikun, Lin Kanghou, Hu Mengjia (represented by Lin Kanghou), Yuan Jinchu, Sun Jingxi, Bei Songsun, Pan Xulun, Tu Zhongxuan, Zou Quan, Chen Tianyin, Sun Tieping, Wu Cangmin, Xu Tingzuo, Chen Guangfu (represented by Bei Songsun), Zou Xieqing, He Shaogeng, Lu Fengzhu, Zhang Zilian, Pan Gongbi, Chen Wenya, Xie Zhongfu, Xu Busun, Zhang Henghai, Yang Guoshu, Xiang Rusong, Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Wang Xiaolai, Ye Fuxiao, Huang Chujiu, Wang Yansong, Qin Runqing, Shi Liangcai (represented by Wang Xiaolai), Cheng Xiechun, Yuan Ludeng, Zhu Yinjiang, Lu Wenshao, Gu Zhuxuan, Wen Lanting, Wu Yunzhai, Wu Zhihao, Lu Feibo Hong, Tu Kaizheng, Chen Tingrui, Geng Jiaji representing the Municipal Government, and Ye Mingji representing the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Speech Chairman Wang Xiaolai said in his speech: "Representatives of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, representatives of the Municipal Government, and fellow representatives of the Association, today is the first meeting of the third general assembly of the Association. It differs from the first meetings of the previous two general assemblies in two aspects. First, the previous two general assemblies were held several days earlier than the Western ratepayers' meetings. This time, it is held on the same day, which indicates that the administration of the Public Concession is now jointly managed by Chinese and foreign ratepayers. The only reason why there is no assembly hall in Shanghai large enough to accommodate all ratepayers, and even if there were such a hall, it would be difficult to achieve effective deliberation by bringing all Chinese and foreign ratepayers together due to language barriers, is that it is hard to have a broad discussion. Second, in the previous two elections, there were only three seats for directors to the Municipal Council. This time, it has increased to five seats. However, due to these two differences, the responsibility of this general assembly is felt to be heavier and greater than that of the previous assemblies after pioneering work. According to the organizational method of this general assembly, it has been implemented for three sessions. The original drafter was Representative Yan E'sheng, who is present today. His intention was to take the strengths of the general parliamentary organization and remove the weaknesses of not being able to concentrate the social elite. He combined the ideals of the political system of Representative Russell and occupational representation, which is a combination of vertical and horizontal societies. On this type of organization, the *Eastern Miscellany* magazine has had articles discussing it, taking the same meaning. Mr. Fessenden, consultant to the Municipal Council, praised the perfection of the Association's organization when he met with me and Representative Xu Jiqing. This shows that whether an organization is good or not needs to be tested. The fact that it is now praised is something that Representative Yan probably did not anticipate when he first drafted it. I was fortunate to be the chairman of the previous meeting. With the support and guidance of the Vice-Chairman Xu and the three standing committee members, Lu Feibo Hong, Wu Yunzhai, and Cheng Xiechun, as well as all the executive committee members and representatives, I am able to relinquish my responsibilities today. However, at this time of handover, it seems appropriate to briefly report on the situation of the Association over the past year. The important matters are scattered in a booklet of important documents of the Association that is now in front of everyone. (1) The most worthy of mentioning in the past year is the increase of two seats for directors to the Municipal Council. Although the number of director seats in the Municipal Council should be based on the proportion of taxes paid, the number of Chinese directors should be 11 out of 20. This is a huge concession made by our Chinese people, not based on population, and a desire for fairness. Currently, only two seats have been added, for a total of five seats, which is far from this desire for fairness. However, 'traveling far begins with the near, and ascending high begins with the low,' which has been the policy adopted since the establishment of the Association. Therefore, although this increase is not satisfactory, the precedent of gradual increase has already begun today. However, I must say one thing here, that is, the increase of these two seats was originally agreed upon orally by Representative Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Fessenden, the former Chairman of the Municipal Council, when mediating the two-percent extra tax in 1927. Unexpectedly, the previous directors, Bei Songsun, Yuan Ludeng, and Zhao Jinqing, based on the exchange of documents between the Association and the Municipal Council, and this oral agreement, proposed a motion to increase the number of Chinese directors by two. Chairman Fessenden did not put it to a vote, believing that the time was not ripe, and simply replied. The previous Association sent a letter to Xu Mo, the former Jiangsu Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, to continue the negotiation, and Director Yu Qiaqing, Director Yuan Ludeng, Director Xu Xinliu, and the committee members made various contacts and efforts. The former Chairman and directors of the Municipal Council also understood the intention that the number of Chinese directors must be increased, and finally a resolution was made to propose an increase. At the same time, the Association also received a notification from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, approving the Minister's reply to the notification of the increase. This is something that the Association and all the Chinese people in the concession should thank the foreign affairs authorities, all the directors and committee members, and Mr. Arnold, the director-general of the Municipal Council. (2) The two-percent extra tax was paid under protest, and it has been more than two years. Regarding the origin and process of the two-percent extra tax, the facts revealed in the minds of our people still cause pain. Paying rights under protest is an irresistible act under the law, and a humiliating method for those who implement high pressure. In this year's budget of the Municipal Council, after negotiations between our directors and committee members and the foreign affairs authorities, it has been decided to abolish this two-percent extra tax on July 1 this year. However, the legal procedures for the refund or agreement of the Chinese taxpayers for the two-percent extra tax paid under protest for two years have not yet been completed. The Municipal Council is plotting ways to resolve it. (3) The May 30th Massacre caused national outrage and shocked the world. Sixty to seventy people were killed or injured, and the other losses are unknown. At the beginning of this year, the compensation aspect has been resolved through the efforts of the directors of the May 30th Cemetery, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and Cheng Xiechun. A total of 150,000 silver dollars has been agreed upon, which is double the original amount. However, the compensation for losses is still pending, and it is hoped that the foreign affairs authorities and the new directors and committee members attending the Municipal Council in this session will complete their work. (4) The Association has not relaxed its efforts to abolish consular jurisdiction. It has twice telegraphed the foreign affairs authorities, requesting them to take decisive measures to abolish it by decree. And for various incidents that requested the government, such as those that could not be implemented due to consular jurisdiction, the consular jurisdiction was severely attacked. The current government has already announced at the end of last year that consular jurisdiction would be abolished from January 1 this year. In addition, in cases such as the rejection of Japanese Ambassador to China Oobata Yuukichi and the case of British soldiers beating Zhang Xueliang to death, the Association either followed other groups or took the lead, proceeding based on the opinions of all the Chinese people in the concession. This should be clear to all representatives. Now, please representatives elect five directors and six committee members to the Municipal Council. After the ballots are counted, elect twenty-seven executive committee members of the Association, and then discuss various important proposals. My speech is lacking in style, please forgive me."</p>
<p>▲ Report by Chinese Directors Director Yuan Ludeng, representing the Chinese directors and committee members attending the previous Municipal Council, reported: "Today is the first meeting of the third general assembly of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai Concession. All the honorable representatives are leaders of the citizens and respected figures in society. We, as the directors and committee members who participated in the municipal administration of the Public Concession in the second session, should report to the representatives on the major affairs we have participated in over the past year. We hope for your consideration. (1) Distribution of committees. Regarding the organization of the Public Concession Municipal Council and the conduct of its administration, the first session of directors and committee members reported to the previous general assembly, so I will not repeat it here. There are a total of 12 committees in the Municipal Council this session. The distribution of committee members and the number of people are as follows: 1. Police Committee: A total of 5 members, with Chinese occupying 2 seats, held by Director Yu Qiaqing and Committee Member Chen Tingrui. 2. Public Works Committee: A total of 4 members, with Chinese occupying 1 seat, held by Director Yuan Ludeng. 3. Finance Committee: A total of 6 members, with Chinese occupying 2 seats, held by Director Xu Xinliu and Committee Member Qin Runqing. 4. Health Committee: A total of 7 members, with Chinese occupying 2 seats, held by Director Xu Xinliu and Committee Member Qian Longzhang. 5. Staff Committee: A total of 4 members, with Chinese occupying 1 seat, held by Committee Member Li Fuxun. 6. Public Utilities Committee: A total of 6 members, with Chinese occupying 2 seats, held by Committee Members Bei Songsun and Lin Kanghou. 7. Music Committee: 2 members, all foreigners. 8. Transportation Committee: A total of 4 members, with Chinese occupying 1 seat, held by Committee Member Chen Tingrui. 9. Foreign Education Committee: 5 members, all foreigners. 10. Chinese Education Committee: A total of 6 members, with Chinese occupying 3 seats, held by Director Yuan Ludeng and Committee Member Lin Kanghou. In addition, there is Mr. Nie Yuntai, who was separately appointed by the Municipal Council. 11. Library Committee: 4 members, all foreigners. 12. Public Sports Field Committee: 4 members, all foreigners. (2) Establishment of Director-General. After Mr. Johnson retired from the Municipal Council, the position of Commissioner-General held by him was abolished. Last year, the position of Director-General was established, held by Mr. Fessenden, the former Chairman of the Municipal Council, to implement all resolutions of the board of directors. His powers are greater than those of the former Commissioner-General. (3) Increase in the Number of Chinese Directors. Increasing the number of Chinese director seats according to the proportion of taxes paid is a fair demand of all Chinese. When the two-percent extra tax issue was resolved the year before last, the mediator Yu Qiaqing discussed with the former Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, about increasing the number of Chinese directors by two last year. The previous directors, Bei Songsun, Yuan Ludeng, and Zhao Jinqing, also proposed to the Municipal Council, based on this agreement and the exchange of documents between the Association and the Municipal Council regarding the increase in the number of Chinese directors. The detailed process was recorded in the important documents of the Association last year, so I will not repeat it here. The colleagues in this session continued to work on it, and with the efforts of Mr. Xu Mo, the former Special Envoy of the Jiangsu Provincial Government for Foreign Affairs, and the understanding of the reasonable wishes of the Chinese people by the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Arnold, and the foreign directors, the entire Municipal Council unanimously resolved to propose a motion at the Western ratepayers' annual meeting this session to increase the number of Chinese directors by two, for a total of five. After this, there should be a total of fourteen Chinese and foreign directors in the Municipal Council. (4) Abolition of the Two-Percent Extra Tax. From July 1, 1927, the Municipal Council increased all municipal taxes (commonly known as patrol tax) in the concession from 14% to 16%, and municipal taxes outside the concession (i.e., in the extra-settlement road area) from 12% to 14%. At that time, Chinese taxpayers believed that the tax increase had not been agreed upon, and they protested. The Association seriously negotiated with the Municipal Council, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Road Merchants' Joint Association also took a consistent stance and jointly resisted. More than 40 stores were forced to close. Later, Yu Qiaqing took the position of mediator, and the two-percent tax increase was finally paid under protest under the name of a two-percent extra tax. Now the Municipal Council has resolved to abolish the two-percent extra tax, and the land tax has also been reduced from 8/1000 to 7/1000, which will be implemented from July 1 this year, and it has also been revised in this year's budget. This is the result of the united legal struggle of the former Jiangsu Commissioner for Foreign Affairs and all Chinese taxpayers. (5) Increase in the Salaries of Chinese Employees. Most of the senior staff of the Municipal Council are foreigners, needless to say. Even the middle-level staff are mostly foreigners, while the lower-level staff are mostly Chinese. There are many differences in the treatment of Chinese and foreign employees. The previous directors, Bei Songsun and Committee Member Li Fuxun, had negotiated with the Municipal Council, and the Council's senior staff should add more Chinese people. In addition to continuing to strive for the application of Chinese staff for senior positions, the colleagues of this session also advocated improving the treatment of all Chinese employees of the Municipal Council, with the principle of equality between Chinese and foreign employees. The Municipal Council has specially set up a salary committee to revise the salary and treatment regulations for Chinese and foreign employees. There are six members of the committee, and Chinese occupy one seat, held by Director Xu Xinliu. Since the meeting, the plan has been roughly formulated. In addition to the salary level, the principle is that Chinese and foreign employees should be treated equally. Before the salary level is decided, a temporary salary increase plan is implemented. All Chinese employees in the bureau will temporarily increase their salaries by 6% to 16% from January 1 this year. Those with higher original salaries will have a lower salary increase rate, which is 6%, and increase in turn until those with lower original salaries, the salary increase is 16%. (6) Construction of Primary School Buildings. The Municipal Council has never attached importance to the education of Chinese children, which cannot be denied. The previous directors and committee members proposed to expand Chinese primary school education based on the exchange of documents between the Association and the Municipal Council. The Municipal Council should first set up primary schools for three years to gradually increase them, and set up a Chinese Education Department to take charge of Chinese education administration, and hire educator Chen Heqin as the director. The Northeastern District Primary School has been open for nearly two years and has achieved good results. However, the Western District Primary School has not yet been opened due to the difficulty in finding a school building. At the beginning of our term, we believed that renting private houses to open schools was only an expedient measure. Therefore, we immediately proposed that the Municipal Council should raise huge sums of money to purchase land and build school buildings for long-term use. Now the Municipal Council has purchased ten acres and one point of land on Xinzha Road for the site of the Western District Primary School, and allocated about ten acres of surplus land from Nie Zhongcheng Public School for the site of the Eastern District Primary School. The construction cost of these two school buildings is estimated to be about 400,000 taels of silver. The Engineering Department of the Municipal Council is now drafting detailed drawings and will start construction soon, and it is expected to be completed within the year. As for the Northern District Primary School, it is currently borrowing private houses. The Municipal Council has decided to move into the Chinese Public School on Ai'erjin Road in the autumn. The Chinese Public School already has a larger school building, which is the original site of the former Thomas Hanbury Western Public School. In addition, education matters are detailed in another report. (7) Reorganization of the Provisional Court. The reorganization of the Provisional Court was implemented on April 1. When Chinese and foreign authorities negotiated the reorganization, we believed that this was the recovery of our country's judicial rights, which involved foreign affairs, and the Municipal Council should not interfere. The colleagues in the bureau and the Western taxpayers can understand this, and there are no obstacles. There are many other facilities, but they are all routine and there is nothing to mention. In short, we have not dared to slack off in the fight for the rights of the Chinese people in our duties. However, we are burdened with heavy responsibilities and often worry about failure. We are ashamed that we cannot live up to the trust of all citizens. Fortunately, the representatives have understanding. April 16, 1930, Reporters: Xu Xinliu, Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, Qian Longzhang, Lin Kanghou, Chen Tingrui, Qin Runqing, Li Fuxun, Bei Songsun."</p>
<p>▲ Another Report Yuan Ludeng also reported on the general situation of Chinese education run by the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council: "The Municipal Council's original Huatong Public School, Yucai Public School, Nie Zhongcheng Public School, and Gezhi Public School had a total of more than 1,690 students in 1929, with annual expenses of 171,360 taels. Since the Chinese directors and committee members participated in municipal administration, the Municipal Council has added two primary schools in the Eastern and Northern Districts, which have been established for nearly two years. Now I will describe the situation of the two primary schools separately: (1) Students. The two primary schools in the Northeastern District began enrolling students on October 1, 1928. At that time, because schools everywhere had already started, and few people outside knew that the Municipal Council was opening new schools, the enrollment results were that the Eastern District Primary School only had 87 students, and the Northern District Primary School only had 78 students. In the spring of 1929, the number of students in both schools suddenly increased. The Eastern District Primary School increased from 87 to 413, and the Northern District Primary School increased from 78 to 396. Those who applied were still coming one after another. Due to the limited capacity of the school buildings, the two schools had to politely decline later applicants. In the spring of 1930, the Eastern District Primary School had 419 students, and the Northern District Primary School had 287 students, which was a slight increase compared to the previous semester. (2) Teachers. At the beginning of the opening of the two primary schools in the Northeastern District, each school only had 8 teachers, 1 principal, and 1 clerk, for a total of 10 teaching staff members per school. In the spring of 1930, the number of students suddenly increased. Due to the opening of more classes, the number of teachers in both schools increased from 8 to 16, for a total of 19 teaching staff members per school. In the spring of 1930, although the number of students was limited by the school buildings, there was no significant increase, but the number of classes gradually increased and the school affairs became more complicated. Each of the two schools increased one clerk, for a total of 20 teaching staff members per school. (3) Expenses. The regulations for the expenses of the two schools are that at the beginning of each year, the Chinese Education Department submits the budget to the Chinese Education Committee of the Municipal Council for review, and then it is implemented after being approved by the Board of Directors. (4) Matters that should be noted in the future. There are about the following points: 1. The area of the Public Concession is vast, and there are many residents. There are about 150,000 Chinese children of school age. Now the two primary schools in the Northeastern District have a total of 688 students, and the four Huatong Public Schools have a total of 1,690 students. Then, there are still 147,300 Chinese school-age children in the concession who do not have the opportunity to enter schools run by the Municipal Council. 2. According to the 1929 report of the Municipal Council, the Chinese education expenses in the Public Concession, in terms of the two primary schools in the Northeastern District, only account for 0.18% of the Municipal Council's annual revenue. Even if the expenses of the four Huatong Public Schools are included, it is still less than 2% of the total. Therefore, it is necessary to actively expand Chinese education in the concession."</p>
<p>Chinese Director Xu Xinliu</p>
<p>▲ Elected Directors and Committee Members The number of Chinese ratepayers attending the Municipal Council was originally three, now increased to five. The following were elected yesterday: (1) Yuan Ludeng 58 votes; (2) Yu Qiaqing 56 votes; (3) Xu Xinliu 56 votes; (4) Bei Songsun 53 votes; (5) Liu Hongsheng 39 votes. The Chinese committee members are still six. The elected members are as follows: Lin Kanghou 54 votes, Qin Runqing 53 votes, Chen Tingrui 51 votes, Li Fuxun 50 votes, Qian Longzhang 46 votes, Wu Yunzhai 45 votes. Among the above five Chinese directors, Yuan, Yu, and Xu are directors from the previous session and are now re-elected. Among the other two newly added, Bei was a committee member in the previous session and is now a director, and Liu was elected for the first time. Among the six committee members, Wu Yunzhai was elected for the first time, and the other five were re-elected.</p>
<p>▲ Elected Executive Committee Members The Association has a total of 81 representatives. According to the charter, 27 executive committee members and 9 alternate members were elected for the ninth session. The following were elected yesterday: Executive Committee Members: Wang Xiaolai, Lu Feibo Hong, Xu Jiqing, Zhu Yinjiang, Shi Zhikun, Cheng Xiechun, Jiang Yiping, Hu Fengxiang, Zhao Jinqing, Shen Tianxin, Tu Kaizheng, Ye Fuxiao, Yan E'sheng, Chu Huiseng, Hu Xisheng, Wu Yaqin, Yuan Jinchu, Zhang Yichen, Sun Jingxi, Fang Jiaobo, Chen Guangfu, Yu Xiji, Xie Zhongfu, Hu Mengjia, Shi Liangcai, Li Bohan, Lu Fengzhu.

<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>▲ Three Proposals Executive Committee Member Wang Yansong proposed: "Respectfully, I would like to point out that municipal facilities must be based on facilitating the majority of citizens. Chinese people account for 80% of the citizens residing in the Public Concession, and the amount of taxes paid, even based on the figures announced by the Municipal Council, is 55% for the Chinese. Moreover, the actual number is more than this. However, all documents and announcements published by the Municipal Council are in English, making it impossible for the Chinese citizens who reside and pay taxes in the absolute majority to understand. This is inappropriate and this error should be corrected immediately. Please propose a resolution by the general assembly of this session, notifying the Municipal Council that from now on, all documents of the Municipal Council should be in Chinese as the main language and English as the secondary language, so that the majority of Chinese citizens can understand the current status of municipal facilities at any time, without further expectation." Executive Committee Member Yan E'sheng proposed: "To propose matters, I hereby submit a draft amendment to the charter in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 of the Association's charter. The main points are: (A) Changing the method of generating representatives. The original number of representatives was 81, generated in three groups, namely 27 people mutually elected by members, 27 people mutually elected by representatives of commercial organizations, and 27 people mutually elected by representatives of fellow-townsman organizations. However, based on handling experience, the number of fellow-townsman organizations is not large, and at the same time, the number of votes for mutually elected citizen members has increased every year. It is now proposed to amend it to: (1) 27 people mutually elected and re-elected by the previous general assembly; (2) 27 people jointly elected by representatives of commercial and fellow-townsman organizations; (3) 27 people mutually elected by individual members, still totaling 81 people. (B) Determining the method of generating representatives attending the Municipal Council. All Chinese directors and committee members attending the Municipal Council are generated by the general assembly. However, there is no clear provision in the charter. A provision should be added to show seriousness, and the quorum for this election meeting should be specified. I hereby submit one copy each of the original charter and the draft amendment to the general assembly for discussion." The above two proposals of the Shanghai Concession Ratepayers' Association were resolved to be handed over to the Executive Committee to form a review committee for review, approved by the Executive Committee, and then a general assembly will be convened for voting.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Annual Meeting of Western Ratepayers in the Shanghai International Settlement <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>▲ Motion to Increase Chinese Directors Defeated</p>
<p>▲ Motion Regarding News Reporters Amended</p>
<p>The annual meeting of Western ratepayers in the Shanghai International Settlement was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the Municipal Hall on Nanjing Road. When the bell rang twice, not many Western ratepayers had arrived. Chairman Brigadier General Macnaghten stated that the meeting time had passed and proposed the first motion to elect Mr. Bael as chairman, seconded by Mr. Hibbard. The motion was unanimously approved by the attendees. After the chairman took his seat and read the notice of the meeting, he invited General Macnaghten to present the second motion to appoint Mr. Faillefeu as the meeting's recorder, again seconded by Mr. Hibbard, and unanimously approved by the attendees. General Macnaghten then proposed the third motion concerning the meeting's agenda, also seconded by Mr. Hibbard, and passed by the attendees. Then followed the fourth motion to approve the report and financial plan for 1929.</p>
<p>▲ Summary of Accounts: General Macnaghten then spoke, stating that the financial report for 1929 had already been distributed, and attendees were likely aware of its main points. The attached report from the Accounting Department summarized all important financial matters of the year, with detailed comparisons of actual and budgeted expenditures. Attendees could see that the Municipal Council strived to economize in all departments, staying within the budget. The ordinary budget for the year had a surplus of 3,534,830 taels, while the estimate was 500,896 taels. This was largely due to the Municipal Council's sale of the Electricity Department and the establishment of a sound method for paying the purchase price in installments with interest, which benefited the Municipal Council's finances. The summary of special income and expenditures for 1929 showed a surplus of 1,538,530 taels. The 4,400,000 taels in bond issuance approved at last year's annual meeting were not raised due to the sale of the Electricity Department. Furthermore, the Council did not intend to request permission from ratepayers to issue bonds in the coming years. The funds received in installments from the sale of the Electricity Department were deposited under the capital account, and all special expansion items were drawn from this account. Previously, due to financial difficulties, the road widening program had not been implemented, but now it was proceeding gradually. Although we are now in a position to handle all major expenses, we still carefully consider the urgency of any expenditure, avoiding any extravagance.</p>
<p>▲ Police Administration: The police administration was greatly reorganized with the assistance of Major General Joulard of the Indian Police. The number of administrative officials was reduced to the minimum, and three executive sections were established: Criminal, Special, and Reserve, each headed by a supervisor directly responsible to the Chief Constable. Four police districts were also established, each with an experienced District Superintendent assisted by a District Detective Officer to manage criminal investigations. Investigating crime was the main function of the police, and special attention was paid to this aspect during the reorganization. In the future, the records of criminal cases and the progress of police investigations should be more accurate than before. The number of detectives in each police station was previously too small, which was inconvenient, and it was important to increase the number. The service conditions of the Chinese police have been improved, and we are now planning to provide them with accommodation so that they can concentrate on their service, strictly observe discipline, and be willing to put forth their efforts in emergencies. Many high positions in the police administration are now planned to be filled by training well-qualified Chinese. The service conditions of European, Japanese, and Indian personnel have also been improved as necessary. The strength of the police force has been increased to keep pace with the development of the Settlement. In the past three years, various aspects of the Settlement have developed rapidly, causing the activities of various departments of the Municipal Council to expand greatly. Not only the police force, but also all departments have been able to cope with the increased responsibilities. This is something we can take comfort in.</p>
<p>▲ Salary Commission: After the Preparatory Committee submitted its report, the Municipal Council followed its recommendation and appointed a Salary Commission in May of last year to investigate the salaries of Chinese and foreign personnel in the Council. In order to abolish the existing allowance system in whole or in part, the Commission recommended paying actual salaries based on rank. The Municipal Council was unable to implement this measure immediately, and lower-level employees, due to the rising cost of living, were suffering and urgently needed temporary assistance. Therefore, the Commission was asked to pay immediate attention to this. During the Commission's discussions, opinions diverged, but after detailed deliberations in June, a temporary relief measure was devised, benefiting all low-paid married foreigners and all Chinese. This measure, after approval, was implemented by the Municipal Council. The Commission then proceeded to investigate employees and compile necessary information. Therefore, a regular meeting was held in November of last year, and the work is nearing completion, with the final report to be submitted soon.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Economy: At last year's annual meeting of ratepayers, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, when speaking, mentioned the report of the Economy Committee, stating that he had been entrusted by the new Board of Directors to declare that the various recommendations of the Economy Committee would be diligently followed. One of the recommendations was that the committee or other similar groups continue their work indefinitely, assisted by two or more salaried specialists to manage everything. The Municipal Council, in order to maintain its affairs, had large expenditures, hence the establishment of the Economy Committee. Considering the committee's deep understanding of the overall situation, implementing this recommendation would require a large expense, which was not initially anticipated. The intention of the Municipal Council was to have an independent investigation conducted by someone who had been working with Chinese and foreign personnel for a long time and was familiar with their service conditions. The number of people with this qualification in this city was naturally limited, and Mr. Creagh was the most suitable. Therefore, he was hired to work with the Salary Commission, which was established at the time, to undertake this important task.</p>
<p>▲ Educational Improvements: The education of Chinese and foreign children in the Settlement has become increasingly difficult in recent years for various reasons, and is now one of the problems that must be addressed first. To facilitate Mr. Creagh's thorough reorganization of the Municipal Council's schools, he has been temporarily appointed as the acting director of the Education Department. The Western Boys' and Girls' Schools will be merged and located in the new building built on the site of the old Victoria Nursing Home, which will save money, improve equipment, and be more effective. The Chinese Public School on Elgin Road will now be moved to the Western School on Hanbury Road, which will increase the number of students by 250. After this proposal is implemented, the school buildings of the Municipal Council will all be Western-style buildings, and two large buildings will be vacated for other public uses. A Western primary school is now needed in the Western District to replace the current temporary school, but the site is difficult to find, and the Municipal Council's construction process is costly, so it has to be approached slowly. The Municipal Council has always taken an equal policy regarding the convenience of Chinese and foreign students in the Settlement to attend school. To promote this policy, it is planned to establish a Chinese primary school on the land recently purchased in the Western District. The current Northern District Primary School will be moved to the old Chinese Public School in that district. The Eastern District Chinese Primary School will be built on a portion of the land of the Nie Zhongcheng Public School to replace it. After this plan is fully implemented, it is expected that the annual cost of Western education will decrease compared to the present, while the annual cost of Chinese education will increase significantly. Now, taking this opportunity, I have a word to tell you, the burden of education costs may soon no longer be fully supported by taxes. The Municipal Council may discuss whether a certain percentage of the annual income can be used to fund education, or whether it will use part of it to subsidize educational institutions that have reached a certain level, regardless of their nationality. The Municipal Council, following the recommendation of the Economy Committee, hired a person familiar with the needs of Chinese and foreign schools to serve as the supervisor of the Education Department, assisting in the management of the Municipal Council's schools, and supplementing it with a permanent Education Committee composed of Chinese and foreign educators. The establishment of this committee aims to express the collective opinions of experts, assist the Municipal Council in handling all educational problems and needs, and seek to promote close cooperation between Chinese and foreign residents on the Municipal Council's educational affairs, which can achieve great and beneficial results.</p>
<p>▲ Provisional Court and Shanghai Special District Court: The agreement on the Chinese court in the International Settlement was signed in Nanjing on February 17, 1930, and immediately announced. After the full text was published, newspapers offered criticisms in opposition, causing the public to feel uneasy about the current political situation. When the Provisional Court Agreement was implemented on January 1, 1927, there was also widespread anxiety, saying that it would be greatly detrimental to foreigners. However, the adverse results found over time were not as serious as expected. I remember that at the annual meeting of ratepayers in April of last year, the Chairman of the Municipal Council criticized the actions of the Provisional Court. However, to be fair, the work of the Provisional Court has greatly improved in the past year. Judging from its current state, it is by no means as bad as the public initially believed. The general impression now is that cases of murder and robbery in the Settlement are emerging one after another, primarily due to the leniency of court judgments and secondly due to the laxity of general administration. Now, let me quote a section of the Municipal Council's annual report on police affairs to inform the public who are concerned about the facts, and the truth will be fully revealed. In 1929, the Municipal Council's police department prosecuted a total of 116,643 cases in the Provisional Court, of which 22,699 were serious criminal cases, with 20,441 convicted and 2,258 acquitted. This shows that in the cases prosecuted by the Municipal Council's police department in the Provisional Court, the defendants convicted accounted for as much as 90%. Compared with the courts of other major cities in the world, the result is commendable. Moreover, the judges of the Provisional Court and today's District Court are able to sincerely serve the public when they are free from interference from administrative officials. The frequent disagreements between the Municipal Council and the Jiang Court are often not due to improper investigations or unfair judgments, but rather because the concepts of judicial principles are fundamentally different between the Chinese and foreigners. In countries that implement new-era judicial systems, their courts are mostly independent and not mixed with government administrative organs, so they cannot be used as tools for implementing government administration. Under this system, individuals and their property are protected, and government officials cannot apply arbitrary, arbitrary, and illegal actions. Although the Nanjing government has recently established new-style courts based on the concepts of the new era of justice, it is a pity that it cannot place the Provisional Court or the court replacing it in a position free from interference from government administrative officials. As a result, the Municipal Council, which controls the police power in the Settlement, and the court frequently disagree, hindering it from being used by Chinese government officials as a tool to interfere in the municipal administration of the Settlement. China's insistence on not allowing its courts to break away from the interference of administrative officials is one of the most powerful arguments against the treaty powers abandoning consular jurisdiction before the time is ripe. According to the current articles of the Provisional Court Agreement, the representative of the consul has no real power, only the ability to protest. Therefore, it is difficult for the representatives to prevent the court from exercising the functions of administrative officials. Now, when the court exercises the functions of administrative officials to interfere with the rights of the Municipal Council, only the police department, acting under the direct orders of the Municipal Council, can deal with it, which is not, as generally believed, done by the consular representative. The representative appointed to negotiate the Provisional Court Agreement with China once consulted with the Chairman and Director-General of the Municipal Council. At the beginning of the discussion, it was informed that it was impossible to keep the consular representative in the same position as stipulated in the old agreement in the new agreement. The representatives of various countries also asked the Municipal Council to provide concrete suggestions on how to resolve the Chinese opposition to the layer of consular representatives. The Chairman and Director-General of the Municipal Council felt that the entire issue of police power and the Provisional Court and the new court was of great importance, especially the court's repeated attempts to exercise the functions of administrative officials. Therefore, they did their best to assist in the formation of a new agreement, gathering all the necessary powers that could be obtained in the hands of the police department. Now, the daily actions of the court are reported to the Municipal Council by the police department, which is the key to the overall situation. Therefore, the Chairman and Director-General of the Municipal Council had suggested to the representatives regarding the new agreement that they should do their best to prevent the new court from secretly trying cases in the new agreement. The Special District Court has now been established on April 1. It has not been long, and incidents have already occurred, indicating that the relationship between the Municipal Council and this type of new court in the future may be no less difficult than the old Provisional Court.</p>
<p>▲ Telephone: The telephone service in the Settlement has long been unsatisfactory to users. In June of last year, various chambers of commerce, organizations, and individuals jointly requested the Municipal Council to order the Delta Telephone Company to implement Article 3 of the 1925 Concession Agreement and begin improvements. The Municipal Council immediately began discussions with representatives of the company. The company representatives admitted that the poor condition of the telephone was due to: (1) the company's failure to anticipate the development of the International Settlement and the French Concession as they are today in the past few years; (2) the company's inability to raise the necessary funds for expansion; (3) the difficulty in purchasing materials during the years of the European War, resulting in mixed purchases; (4) the Municipal Council's rejection of the company's request to increase user fees two years ago; and (5) the discovery of so-called poor outdoor equipment conditions after the conversion to automatic telephones. The company, for financial reasons, was unable to remedy the situation. To make matters more difficult, before the company discussed the matter with the Municipal Council, it had accepted offers of financial assistance related to the manufacture of automatic telephone equipment and facilitating telephone services without submitting them to the Municipal Council for consideration, and had already made certain decisions. After lengthy discussions between the Municipal Council and the company, it was decided to hire an impartial expert for the Municipal Council's consultation and to notify the French Municipal Council of this move, which agreed. The company did not oppose the hiring of an expert, but felt that it would cause unnecessary delays, as the company had already made arrangements for improvements, and had installed automatic machines, and new machines ordered would arrive one after another. Waiting for the expert to arrive would stop the established procedures. Later, Mr. Anson submitted a report, and public opinion felt that it would be beneficial to the public to sell the telephone business to a financially strong organization that operated telephones. Now, there are three groups of representatives stationed in Shanghai, willing to bid to purchase the Delta Telephone Company. The three groups are competing fiercely for this matter. It concerns the public. If the actions of the two municipal councils or the Delta Telephone Company are seen as discriminatory in any way, it will cause a backlash. Therefore, the Delta Telephone Company decided to ask the three groups to bid to purchase it according to the current concession, and the director-generals of the two municipal councils and the company's representatives, Baker and others, would form an advisory committee to consider the bids together. Although the three groups have already submitted bids, the advisory committee believes that none of them can be accepted. Therefore, the two municipal councils decided to slightly amend the current concession as the basis for continued bidding or continued negotiations on the bids received. The municipal councils have disagreed on this amendment, so it has taken a long time to discuss and reach an agreement. On April 4, the concession amendment was sent to the company, which forwarded it to the advisory committee, which reopened negotiations with all parties concerned based on this method. It is currently in progress. After General Macnaghten finished his speech, he asked the audience to vote on the fourth motion, which was unanimously passed by the attendees.</p>
<p>▲ Fifth Motion: The chairman explained the fifth motion, saying that the 1930 budget had already been sent to the attendees for consideration and did not need to be elaborated on. It was found that under the regular section, the income and expenditure offset showed a surplus of 3,277,490 taels. However, if the police tax rate was not reduced from 16% to 14% and the land tax rate from 8/1000ths to 7/1000ths from July 1, restoring the old rates before 1927, the surplus would be much greater. I remember that at the annual meeting of ratepayers last year, the Chairman said that after the sale of the Electricity Department, the new Board of Directors would consider the issue of tax cuts. I am very happy to be able to fulfill my previous words today. As for the expenditure side, the police department's expenses increased by 43% compared to last year, which is 1,637,530 taels. This is a natural result of the large increase in the number of police officers in each police station, especially the number of Chinese police officers. The details are recorded in the Municipal Council's Gazette. Major Joulard's reorganization plan for the police force has been implemented under his command. This year, it is planned to add another team,</p>

<p>Local News Two</p>
<p>named the Armed Reserve Team, which will be based on the existing Reserve Team and will select capable members from each team to organize it. The aim is to increase strength in peacetime and to use it for emergencies. However, it will not be fully established this year, so the increased expenses will be borne by next year's budget. The Engineering Department also increased its expenses by 770,000 taels, mostly due to the difficulty of handling garbage and the increase in the cost of municipal property. The garbage problem is being seriously considered by the Board of Directors, which is trying to purchase and build an incinerator. The expenses have also been included in the special budget. The expenses of other departments have also increased due to the increase in salaries and allowances for the bureau members. Also, the amortization expenses of public bonds were not listed under the regular expenses this time, which is the result of the sale of the Electricity Department. As for the special expenses, the budget can obtain a surplus of 2,382,720 taels. On the income side, it is planned to withdraw 23,565,110 taels from the Shanghai Electric Power Company for the sale price of the Electricity Department, and 1,170,000 taels can also be obtained from the soon to be handover of the Municipal Hall to the purchaser. The site of the new Municipal Hall is under consideration, and it is expected that the new Board of Directors will be able to make a decision this year. On the expenditure side, there is a large-scale building construction plan, because the addition of police stations and detention centers, and police dormitories are all urgent. Also, the addition of a fire brigade is necessary due to the development of the Settlement. In addition, the Victoria Nursing Home is about to start construction, and there are plans to add vegetable markets and slaughterhouses. As for Chinese education in the Settlement, it is necessary to increase its convenience, as mentioned earlier. In this budget, a portion of the construction costs of school buildings in the east and west districts has been listed. However, since the Municipal Council is building so many projects, rushing in one aspect may hinder other equally important aspects. Regarding the preparation of the budget for Chinese primary schools, the Municipal Council has no intention of delaying the construction of school buildings, and I can assure Chinese friends that the Municipal Council will do its best to complete it as soon as possible. In addition, the repayment of public bonds will be listed once at 161,000,000 taels. Furthermore, I have one more word to say. Now that the municipal tax has been proposed to be reduced, the police expenses may increase even more. The interest paid by the Shanghai Electric Power Company to the Municipal Council will also gradually decrease as its principal is gradually used, so it is necessary to find a way to fix the tax revenue in the coming years. Therefore, the Board of Directors has considered the issue of revaluing land prices. According to the estimated land prices in the Settlement, the tax assessment is much lower than the market price. It is planned to revalue the land prices as soon as possible, and the results should be seen in next year's budget. The fifth motion is proposed, "Please approve the 1930 budget and accompanying recommendations made by the old Board of Directors, so that the Bureau can collect various taxes in accordance with the budget." The audience passed it without objection.</p>
<p>▲ Sixth Motion: The Chairman began to explain the sixth motion, saying that the proposal to add three Chinese directors to the Municipal Council was passed by the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting in 1926 and subsequently approved by the diplomatic corps. However, after two years, Chinese in the Settlement began to nominate directors to join the Municipal Council. During these two years, Chinese representatives and Municipal Council representatives negotiated several times, trying to persuade the Municipal Council to make a firm agreement on the time and number of seats for future increases in Chinese directors. The Municipal Council did not want to be bound by this, and formally stated its position in a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association on March 26, 1928, stating that the Municipal Council fully recognized that, according to the proposed method (three seats), if Chinese cooperation was complete, it would lead to an increase in the number of Chinese directors in the ordinary course of events, etc. Later, when the Chinese directors took office, there was indeed an understanding between Chinese and foreign citizens that the gradual increase rate of the number of Chinese directors in the future would be determined at least to some extent by the degree of cooperation of the Chinese directors. At the 1929 Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting, the Chairman mentioned this matter, saying that the Chinese directors were all talented, far-sighted, and capable, and able to sincerely resolve the various difficult and complex issues of divergent views between Chinese and foreign people in order to enhance coordination and goodwill between the two sides, etc. As for the past year, the Chinese directors have also been able to cooperate fully to the extent possible in this mixed Chinese and foreign community, where the interests and views of various countries are sometimes difficult to compromise. I feel that in order to express sincerity and trust, we should take the initiative to find ways to increase the number of Chinese directors. Moreover, if this matter can be done automatically and quickly, it will greatly enhance Chinese-foreign friendship compared to reluctantly agreeing after bargaining. The Municipal Council's proposal to increase Chinese directors was announced before Judge Feetham came to Shanghai as a consultant. Judge Feetham's views on these issues cannot be announced until the report is prepared. However, he allowed me to declare that he believes that the passage of the motion to increase Chinese directors by this meeting would be beneficial to the public. Now, I respectfully propose the sixth motion, "Authorize the Municipal Council to request the countries concerned to increase the number of Chinese directors from three to five." A Westerner, Macdonald, then came forward to vehemently oppose it, saying that this kind of change would arouse ambition and be very dangerous. Although some guarantees have been given for the increase of Chinese directors, the person who gave this guarantee on that day was dancing with power, so this kind of guarantee is not enough to bind the ratepayers, etc. When the final vote was taken, this motion failed to pass.</p>
<p>▲ Seventh Motion: The seventh motion was then proposed, electing Mr. Brockman as this year's Land Reduction Committee member.</p>
<p>▲ Eighth Motion: The eighth motion was then proposed, electing four annual managers for the Public济 Hospital.</p>
<p>▲ Ninth Motion: Finally, the ninth motion was proposed, "News reporters should be allowed to attend and observe Municipal Council meetings as representatives of the public. However, when a majority of the council's directors decide, for the benefit of the public, that news reporters should leave the meeting, the news reporters should leave immediately. Also, the minutes of board meetings and committee meetings, after being approved by the Board of Directors, should be delivered to newspapers as soon as possible after each board meeting, except for those that should not be published for the benefit of taxpayers." The original proposer, Mr. Harris, stood up to explain, saying that the purpose of this motion was only to create an open public opinion and assist from the sidelines, in view of the fact that there are often extremely complex and important issues awaiting decision by the Municipal Council Board of Directors. The wording of the motion is very careful, hoping that everything important to us foreigners can be made public, while at the same time, there is a huge guarantee against leakage for those that should not be made public. The intention of this motion is not to give all newspaper representatives the right to attend. I mean that if this motion is passed, the Municipal Council will ask each newspaper to nominate two or three experienced and reliable representatives to enjoy the right to attend and observe exclusively, and distribute their news to various newspapers for publication. Therefore, it can be guaranteed that these representatives will be trained and qualified personnel. All directors can freely express their opinions, and there is no fear of inverting black and white and confusing the audience. Moreover, since the second section of the motion stipulates that the entire record of the meeting should be published as soon as possible, it can also provide a correction to the news recorded by the news reporters. Some say that since a detailed record has already been published as soon as possible, why is there still a need to attend and observe? I do not know that this record of the meeting must be published at the fastest 48 hours after the close of the meeting. In the eyes of the newspaper industry, it has become yesterday's news and is not enough to be called news. Moreover, the records of the meeting are all dull and tasteless, while the news published by newspapers must be fresh and sharp. I have discussed this matter with the editors and reporters of various newspapers, and they all said that if this motion does not have the first paragraph of the provision for attendance and observation, then the second paragraph of the provision for publicizing the record of the meeting will be of no benefit. Currently, Shanghai is the only major city in the world that does not allow newspaper representatives to attend municipal meetings. In the Hong Kong Legislative Council, even when there are issues that cannot be discussed publicly, news reporters are still allowed to attend, only not allowed to record and leak them. Only in this way can news reporters deeply understand the inside story of the motion, so that after the resolution is published in the future, it will be prevented from being an incorrect commentary. Fortunately, most of the newly elected directors agree to municipal openness. If we try to practice secret diplomacy again in the future, the result will inevitably be losses. I feel that the opinions of foreigners in Shanghai will not be ignored by the diplomatic personnel stationed in China, and at least they will be disregarded by their own government. The reason is that their own government often blames that the Shanghai Municipal Council meetings are kept secret, and the foreigners and taxpayers do not have a society that allows their opinions to be heard by the government, so how can the government know the thoughts and desires of you foreigners in Shanghai? Therefore, I hope that after news reporters are allowed to attend and observe Board of Directors meetings, a Western Taxpayers' Association will be organized at the same time, and an international committee will be elected to do its best to assist the Municipal Council and cooperate with each other, and when necessary, convene a meeting of taxpayers to present their opinions to the diplomatic officials stationed in China and to their own government, etc. Next, after the seconder, Mr. Marsden, made a brief speech, the Chairman of the Municipal Council immediately stood up and proposed an amendment, deleting the first paragraph of the original motion and retaining the second paragraph, and adding an explanation, saying that the proposal to allow the public to attend and observe Municipal Council Board of Directors meetings has now been proposed to the annual meeting of taxpayers for the fourth time. All three previous times were rejected by a majority, and this time the Board of Directors also invited the new directors of this session to discuss it in detail together. As a result, although it advocated as much publicity as possible, it was believed that news reporters should not attend and observe. The reason for this is, to take today's meeting as an example, if newspaper representatives are allowed to attend, in order to discuss freely, it will inevitably be necessary to ask news reporters to leave the meeting from time to time, which is not only cumbersome but also ridiculous, one. From a political point of view, Shanghai is going through an extremely serious period, and it is likely that diplomatic personnel will often submit to the Board of Directors for discussion the situation of negotiations on complex issues involving national sentiments. At this time, in theory, it seems possible to exclude news reporters, but in practice it is difficult to do so, two. There is a great danger of restricting the freedom of speech of the directors, making it impossible for them to express their opinions freely and frankly, three. After the Chinese directors joined, they can often freely and frankly express their opinions, which is of great benefit to solving difficult problems and enhancing Chinese-foreign goodwill. If there are news reporters present, it is believed that Board of Directors meetings will no longer be able to express their opinions as freely and frankly as before, four. Therefore, I propose the ninth amendment, "The entire record of Board of Directors meetings and committee meetings, after being approved by the Board of Directors, should be delivered to newspapers as soon as possible after each meeting, except for those that should not be published for the benefit of taxpayers." Later, the seconder, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Hughes spoke one after another, saying that there are six newspapers in Shanghai from China, Britain, America, Japan, France, and Russia. If news reporters are sent to attend and observe, they must all be allowed to attend without discrimination. When the final vote was taken, the amendment was passed by a majority, and the meeting adjourned at 4:40 PM.</p>
<p>▲ News After the Meeting: When the taxpayers' annual meeting was in progress, an Indian, claiming to be a communist, tried to break into the meeting place through the side door of the Municipal Hall. A Russian policeman greeted and stopped him. The Indian immediately punched him and fought with other policemen. Finally, he was defeated due to his inability to fight against many, and was captured by the policemen. Only after his hands and feet were tied could he be escorted to the Old Zha police station. During the mutual fighting, a Western police head was injured by the Indian.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Dramatic Change in the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Councillor Issue <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>▲ Chinese Taxpayers' Association Elects Five Chinese Councillors</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Taxpayers' Association Rejects Increase Proposal</p>
<p>▲ Danger of Japanese Manipulation of Municipal Affairs</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association General Assembly and the Foreign Taxpayers' Annual Meeting of the Public Concession were held separately yesterday afternoon. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association, based on the Shanghai Municipal Council's January 6 resolution to increase the number of Chinese councillors from three to five, elected five Chinese councillors, Yuan Lvdeng, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Bei Songsun, and Liu Hongsheng, at a meeting yesterday to attend this term of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Foreign Taxpayers' Association also held its annual meeting yesterday at City Hall. The Shanghai Municipal Council proposed the increase of Chinese councillors according to the regulations, but the result was a rejection. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese councillor issue has therefore undergone a dramatic change. The assumption of office by the Chinese and foreign councillors of the Shanghai Municipal Council was originally scheduled for this afternoon, but with this sudden twist, not only is it impossible for the Chinese and foreign councillors to assume office today, but before a satisfactory resolution of this issue, it is feared that the Chinese and foreign councillors will be unable to meet. Yesterday, our reporter inquired about the attitudes of the newly elected Chinese councillors on this matter. All stated that they could not express any opinion until they received formal notification from the Shanghai Municipal Council. How to deal with this matter in the future will depend on the Shanghai Municipal Council's approach. However, according to private sources, the most difficult aspect of this issue is that in the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to increase the number of Chinese councillors, our side initially insisted that the ratio of foreign councillors to Chinese councillors should be nine to eleven. In August of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), Yu Qiaqing verbally agreed with the Shanghai Municipal Council's Feixin Dun that in the 18th year of the Republic (1929), Chinese councillors Bei Songsun, Yuan Lvdeng, and Zhao Jinqing wrote to the then Director-General Feixin Dun, requesting that he propose an increase. However, Feixin Dun neither submitted it to the board of directors for discussion nor submitted it to the taxpayers' meeting for resolution, but simply replied with his personal opinion. Subsequently, the Jiangsu Diplomatic Commissioner's Office, based on the final compromise proposal of the three Chinese councillors, negotiated with the leading consuls, hoping that the number of Chinese councillors would be increased by at least two this year. The leading consul then conveyed this to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Director-General for consideration. The Shanghai Municipal Council held a meeting on January 6 of this year and unanimously agreed to the resolution, which was communicated by the leading consul to the Diplomatic Commissioner's Office and forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for reference. Therefore, the Chinese councillor issue has temporarily come to an end. However, this was still a compromise on our part. Who knew that the Foreign Taxpayers' Annual Meeting would reject the proposal yesterday? The Shanghai Municipal Council is now in a difficult position. They consider the taxpayers' annual meeting to be the highest decision-making body, but the Shanghai Municipal Council's resolutions have always been successfully passed in the annual meeting. The rejection of this proposal is tantamount to the annual meeting's lack of confidence in the Shanghai Municipal Council. The election of the five Chinese councillors is based on the exchange of official documents between the negotiating authorities of both sides, and they will not allow the established case to be overturned and make concessions again. Moreover, the Chinese side is not satisfied with the number of five Chinese councillors, and further negotiations will be necessary to increase the number. Therefore, if there is now a desire to return to the original number of seats, the Chinese councillors and Chinese committee members will take a unified attitude, refuse to attend meetings, and wait for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to file a protest or promote the recovery of the concession. Furthermore, according to a certain legal scholar, this issue is a political issue, not a legal issue. The attendance of Chinese councillors on the Shanghai Municipal Council is an inherent right of the Chinese citizens of the concession. Now, the power to increase or decrease the number of Chinese councillors must be determined by the Foreign Taxpayers' Association. This means that the inherent rights of the majority of Chinese citizens are controlled by a small number of foreigners, which is fundamentally wrong. According to another source, the rejection of the proposal to increase the number of Chinese councillors at this Foreign Taxpayers' Annual Meeting was actually manipulated by the Japanese. The annual meeting has a total of about 1,200 voting rights, with the Japanese and British/Americans each holding half. When the proposal was put to a vote this time, about 200 British/Americans gave up their voting rights. Therefore, the Japanese, due to their failure to increase the number of Japanese councillors, used 600 votes against 400 votes to reject the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposed increase in Chinese councillors. It is said that the recent defeat of Arnold, the former Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in the election of foreign councillors was also manipulated by the Japanese. The Japanese will have a significant and dangerous influence on the future of municipal affairs in the concession.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Record of the British Chamber of Commerce's Annual Meeting the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>▲ Marshall's Speech on Commerce in China</p>
<p>▲ Brenan's Speech on Issues Regarding China</p>
<p>According to the "Zi Lin Daily", the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai held its 15th annual meeting at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday (the 15th) afternoon. Chairman Marshall, British Consul-General Brenan, and Jameson, acting commercial secretary of the British Embassy, also attended the meeting. The chairman's speech summarized the current political, financial, and commercial situation in China, as well as the chamber's activities over the past year. He believed that the decline in silver prices was greatly influenced by instability in the interior and commercial depression. Therefore, the chamber advocated that instead of artificially raising silver prices, efforts should be made to eliminate obstacles to commerce in various provinces, encourage industry and commerce, and promote local prosperity. This would not only absorb the silver stored in Shanghai but also make the country unified and increasingly consolidated. He also stated that in the future, doing business in China would increasingly require proficiency in Chinese, which would soon become an indispensable language for merchants seeking success. He hoped that various foreign firms would send more junior staff to the meeting to learn. Last year, the number of unemployed British people in Shanghai increased significantly, with a total of 245 people registered. However, two-thirds of them have now found employment, etc. After the chairman's speech, the chamber's annual report and accounts were approved, and eight new directors, including Marshall, were elected. Then, the chairman invited the British Consul-General to speak. Brenan rose and addressed the audience, saying that they were all here for business, and that Britain's interests in China were mainly commercial. At a time when the country (referring to Britain) was facing financial pressure and high unemployment, maintaining and increasing export trade, preserving old overseas markets, and opening up new markets were fundamental priorities. If this goal could be achieved, even if it meant slightly harming the comfort and convenience of British residents, as well as purely local interests, it would be done. This was the British government's attitude towards all issues in China. However, to trade with others, it was necessary to maintain reasonable friendship. The national rights movement was one of the world's movements today, and all countries in the East were involved, including China. Any changes to the status of foreigners in China that were desired by the majority of educated and politically concerned Chinese people could not be ignored simply because they caused inconvenience to foreigners or were considered premature. The use of force would ultimately lead to mutual destruction, etc. After the British Chamber of Commerce's meeting ended, the China Association's annual meeting was held immediately, which also approved the association's report and accounts and elected new directors before adjourning.</p>

The committee has sent letters to various parties to raise the full amount in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Central Government Orders Resolution of Pharmaceutical Industry Dispute <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Training Department of the Central Executive Committee sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee, stating that the pharmaceutical industry labor dispute in Shanghai Special Municipality has been repeatedly reported by your committee and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, as well as by the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Trade Association and the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, all stating that this dispute has been mediated by your committee and others, but due to the extreme positions taken by both labor and management, it has not been formally resolved, and requesting that the matter be investigated and handled. The department dispatched personnel to investigate, and it was reported that both labor and management urgently needed a resolution. The department, based on the report and referring to the mediation methods proposed by your committee and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, has formulated a method for resolving the pharmaceutical industry dispute in Shanghai, which has been submitted to the Central Government for approval. In addition to sending separate letters, we are enclosing the resolution method and sending it to your committee, together with the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, to instruct the Pharmaceutical Trade Association and the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union to comply with it. The progress of the handling must be reported in detail. The enclosed resolution method for the Shanghai pharmaceutical industry dispute is as follows: (1) There are currently more than 300 pharmacies in Shanghai Special Municipality, many of which are prosperous and have considerable profits. However, due to the large number of employers, there seems to be a shortage of manpower. Prosperous pharmacies can employ a larger number of workers. The Shanghai Labor Dispute Mediation Committee has approved more than 64 qualified workers. (2) Workers who are not qualified by the Mediation Committee should be compensated by the employer for their dismissal as a sign of consideration. (3) The pharmaceutical workers' strike this time is understandable, so the employer should pay half of the wages during the strike period as a sign of consideration. (4) The system of apprenticeships, replacements, and temporary workers in pharmacies should be handed over to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government for proper discussion and resolution after the labor unrest is resolved to eliminate disputes. (5) In the future, both labor and management must earnestly abide by the central government's laws and regulations, work together with one heart and one mind to seek the development of the pharmaceutical industry, and there must be no more disputes. (6) This method should be handled jointly by the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Major Fire in Nanshi This Morning <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>▲ Heavy Losses</p>
<p>At 2:45 AM this morning (the 17th), a fire suddenly broke out at the Hongqiao end in the city, and the red light filled the sky, making it impossible to approach. The streets and alleys around Hongqiao are extremely narrow, and the houses are densely packed and very old, making them prone to fire, so the fire spread very quickly. The fire brigades from various districts in Nanshi heard the alarm and drove their pumps to the scene to put out the fire. However, due to the narrow roads, it was difficult to deploy and shoot water. As of 3:30 AM this morning, when our newspaper went to press, the fire had not yet been extinguished. It is not yet known whether anyone was burned to death, but it is expected that the losses will be very heavy, truly a great disaster.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Ma Chuntai, a Primary School Student from Biwen, Kidnapped <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>▲ Left Home in the Afternoon, Disappeared</p>
<p>▲ Received a Letter from the Bandits Yesterday, Discovering the Kidnapping</p>
<p>▲ Due to a Grudge with His Father, They Kidnapped His Son</p>
<p>▲ Ransom of 500 Yuan Required for Release</p>
<p>The six-year-old boy from the Ma De Ji Clothing Store on Fang Xie Road in Nanshi disappeared the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, a letter was suddenly received, revealing that he had been kidnapped by bandits. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Old Shop with a Reputation: Ma Ji, a native of Changzhou, is 36 years old and has been running the Ma De Ji Clothing Store at No. 332 Baolong Lane, near Baiyun Temple on Fang Xie Road in Nanshi, for over 20 years. It was founded by Ma's father, Jin Gao. In addition to his own work, Ma employs several partners and apprentices. His monthly income is just enough to make ends meet. Ma's wife, Sun, is 35 years old and has only one son, six-year-old Chuntai. The child is naturally clever and was sent to Biwen Girls' School at No. 104 Xilinhou Road nearby when he was five years old.</p>
<p>▲ Sudden Disappearance: Chuntai usually goes to school with several neighbors every morning. The school provides lunch, and school ends at 5:00 PM. It was the usual routine. At 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, he returned home for lunch. His mother told him to wait a moment because the meal was not yet ready. After the meal, he left with his neighbors again and returned to ask Sun for three copper coins. At the same time, Sun also went to relatives in Yangshupu for business. When she returned home at 6:00 PM, she found that Chuntai had not yet returned home. She went to the school to inquire and was told by the teacher that he had not returned to school after lunch. The whole family was in a panic, suspecting that he was missing. They immediately sent out search parties.</p>
<p>▲ Suddenly Received a Letter from the Bandits: Ma was distraught over the disappearance of his son and sent out search parties to search all night, but there was no trace of him. At about 9:00 AM yesterday, Ma suddenly received a letter, which stated that they had a long-standing grudge with him, so they had hidden his son. If he wanted his son back, he had to pay 500 yuan. The letter also arranged a meeting place near the Sun Temple in Chubei. After receiving the letter, Ma did not dare to report it to the police at the time. However, Zhang Heshan, the patrol chief of the Second District, passed by and heard people talking about it. He reported it to District Chief Wang. District Chief Wang immediately sent Inspector Gao Hongbin to investigate.</p>
<p>▲ Ordered a Crackdown: When Inspector Gao went to investigate, Ma initially concealed the truth. After he told the truth, Inspector Gao took the letter from the bandits to the police station and reported it to District Chief Wang. After receiving the report, District Chief Wang immediately ordered the team leader of the detectives, Cao Junda, and the detectives on duty to strictly investigate the case. If the bandits could repent and send Chuntai back, they would not be investigated further. If they remained unrepentant and insisted on extortion, they would not be tolerated once they were caught. By then, it would be too late to regret it.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Four Kidnappers Executed by Firing Squad <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>▲ Six Involved in the Same Case</p>
<p>▲ Two Sent Back for Retrial</p>
<p>▲ The Four Criminals Protested Before Their Deaths</p>
<p>▲ Why Aren't the Other Two Dying Too?</p>
<p>▲ Brutally Killed Ye Daming: The kidnappers Wang Liangui, Li Afu, Rong Zhengchang, Shen Shaoqing, Ma Qiyuan, and Liu Fuxing (also known as Wang Laosi), etc., kidnapped Ye Zhuotang's son, Ye Daming, on Kade Road in Huxi on May 31st of last year. Because he resisted, the bandits brutally killed him.</p>
<p>▲ Committed Two More Kidnappings: Later, they were arrested by the police and found to have also kidnapped Chu Pusun, chairman of the Gold Exchange on Nanjing Road, and Ni Yugui, manager of the Shenxin Yarn Factory on Bailinan Road, for ransom. In addition, they committed multiple robberies.</p>
<p>▲ Two Criminals Must Be Retried: The former Provisional Court investigated and sentenced the six bandits, including Wang, to death and reported it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for review. Now, the order has been issued to the court. Except for Ma and Liu, who were sent back for retrial, the rest will be executed according to the judgment.</p>
<p>▲ Saying Goodbye to Their Mothers: At 2:00 PM yesterday, the Special District District Court notified the police station to escort the four criminals, Wang, Li, Rong, and Shen, to the Third Tribunal. Presiding Judge Cheng Shangfeng ascended the bench, announced the provincial order, and asked the criminals if they had any last words. Wang Liangui stated that his other name was Wang Chaolin, he was 28 years old, a native of Wuxi, and lived at No. 2464 behind the court in Shanghai. He still had parents and brothers at home. He was a carpenter. He had three long gowns, a fur coat, and a raincoat when he was arrested and requested that they be returned. His mother was also in court and asked to be allowed to see her one last time. The judge granted permission, and Wang spoke a few words with his mother.</p>
<p>▲ Pretending to Be Calm: Li Afu then stated that his other name was Tang Jinbiao, he was 40 years old, a native of Ningbo, and lived at No. 721 Fuxu Road in Shanghai. He had no last words. Rong Zhengchang stated that his other name was Xiao Rong, he was from Wuxi, and lived in Zhoujiaqiao. He specialized in kidnapping. He asked to send a letter to the Cloth Room of the Housheng Yarn Factory on Lan Road to his brother, Rong Yueqing, so that he would know that he had been executed today. He pretended to be calm while speaking.</p>
<p>▲ Twenty Years Is Still a Young Man: Shen Shaoqing stated that he was 31 years old, a local, and used to be a chauffeur at No. 202 Fukaissen Road, nicknamed Xiao Shen. Since he had committed the crime of kidnapping, he should be executed. In twenty years, he would still be a young man.</p>
<p>▲ Protesting at the Last Minute: Wang, Li, Rong, and Shen then stated that Ma and Liu were actually informants in the Ye Daming kidnapping case. If they had not reported it, how would they have known that Ye was wealthy? Therefore, their deaths were actually caused by Ma and Liu. Since the two were sentenced to death at the same time, why were only the four of them being sent for execution today? Judge Cheng replied that the provincial government had ordered that the cases of Ma and Liu be reviewed, so they could not be executed today.</p>
<p>▲ The Cries of the Families: After the order was given, the four criminals were ordered to board the car, along with the judgment and photos, and were handed over to the detectives for escort to the Jiangxi Second Prison execution ground in Caohejing. The Shanghai District Court was also entrusted to send a prosecutor and execution police officers to the scene to verify their identities and order the execution. Police Chief Yang directed the police officers to take the four criminals down and execute them together by firing squad. Gunshots rang out, and the families of the executed criminals outside the gate cried loudly. After the inspecting officer verified that each criminal was dead, he ordered that they be temporarily taken for coffin and sealing, waiting for the family members to claim them. Although the Shanghai District Court's Special Zone Court's equipment was gradually being completed, the death penalty must be carried out by the court itself. However, the Special Zone Court had not yet prepared all the procedures for carrying out the death penalty, so this time it still relied on the police officers of the District Court to handle the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e157">A Criminal Escapes While Checking for Stolen Goods <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>▲ Yu San Involved in a Counter-Revolutionary Case</p>
<p>▲ Managed to Get Rid of His Shackles</p>
<p>▲ Escaped into the Crowd</p>
<p>▲ Disappeared Without a Trace</p>
<p>The Hongkou Police Station had recently arrested nine men and women, including Lin Jinhun, one after another. Xu Wurongsheng and his concubine, Lin Qiaoyun, were temporarily detained outside the Zhabei Police Station. The other seven had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities and committed major robberies and had been handed over to the Higher Branch Court for preliminary trial. According to reports in this newspaper, the handling detectives had delivered a dispatch to the Public Security Bureau the day before yesterday afternoon to bring Wu and Lin back to the police station for separate detention. Yesterday morning, they were still escorted to the Higher Branch Court. Judge Gao Junxiang opened a court for preliminary trial. According to Wu Rongsheng, he lived at No. 169 Lafayette Road in the French Concession and used to be a tea boy on the Yangtze River steamer. He met Yu San at the beginning of this year and had robbed with him. One day, he went to the Great World to play and met Lin Qiaoyun, and they began to live together. Judge Gao then granted the police station's request and ordered the male and female defendants to be detained separately for further investigation. As for Yu San, who was arrested, he had confessed to the police station that part of the clothes he had stolen had been pawned at a pawnshop in Baoyu Lane on Ador Road in the French Concession. Therefore, the day before yesterday afternoon, the police chief sent detectives to take Yu San to the pawnshop to check for stolen goods. When they arrived at the entrance of the pawnshop, Yu San took advantage of the detectives' duties to try to get rid of his shackles and escape into the crowd. At that time, there were no less than a hundred people gathered there watching the excitement, so he escaped without a trace.</p>
<h3 id="e158">A Scavenger Finds a Bomb <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>▲ Mistook It for a Valuable Item</p>
<p>▲ Blew Off Half of His Finger</p>
<p>Xu Fulin, a native of Wuxi, is 39 years old and makes a living by scavenging. Yesterday morning at 5:00 AM, he found a bomb wrapped in paper under the corridor on the west side of the intersection of Zilai Street and the main road in the French Concession. Xu did not know what it was at first, mistaking it for a valuable item. After picking it up, he took it to the front of No. 25 Jixing Lane, Jixiang Street, and opened the package to examine it. There was a glass tube on top of the bomb. Xu tried to pull out the glass tube. As soon as he moved it, it suddenly exploded with a loud bang and flames spread everywhere, instantly blowing off the upper half of Xu's right finger. Blood and flesh flew everywhere, and he fainted and fell to the ground. The police heard the sound and rushed to the scene. After questioning him, the police chief ordered him to be sent to Renji Hospital for treatment pending further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Strange Death of a Female Worker at the Yong'an Yarn Factory <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>▲ Body Prostrate as If Praying to Buddha</p>
<p>▲ Thin Oiled Yarn Around Her Neck</p>
<p>Ding Caier, an 18-year-old female worker from Qinzhou at the Yong'an Second Yarn Factory in Wusong Yanzao, who lived in the No. 91 workshop of Yong'an, suddenly hanged herself yesterday morning at 6:00 AM for unknown reasons. Her roommates found out and broke into the room to rescue her, but it was too late. They immediately reported the situation to Zhang Jiguang, the director of the First Station in the Seventh District, who sent personnel and Yu Shoulian, the local security officer of the 33rd ward, to investigate. The worker's death was strange and suspicious. When the female worker hanged herself, her feet were kneeling on the ground, and her body was prostrate, as if she were praying to Buddha. There were only a few strands of very thin oiled yarn around her neck. Director Zhang, fearing that there were other circumstances, immediately reported to her family and ordered local security officer Yu Shoulian to go to Shanghai to request the District Court to send a representative to Wusong to examine the body for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Housing Dispute in Yin Yu Lane Resolved <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>▲ Rent Reduction of 10 to 15 Yuan</p>
<p>▲ No Increase or Decrease Within Four Years</p>
<p>The houses in the Yin Yu Lane area of ​​the French Concession were renovated last year by the British firm Dehe Foreign Company, which also acted as the rental agent. Construction began around last summer and was completed in August and September. There are more than 100 houses inside and outside. The price of housing is 65 to 70 yuan per building, and the price of market houses is 90 to 130 yuan. The total monthly income is 8,000 to 9,000 yuan, which is much higher than the monthly income of 2,000 yuan before the renovation. The old tenants complained that the rent had increased three or four times, and they could not afford it. They formed the "Yin Yu Lane Tenants' Union" and repeatedly sent letters requesting the landlord and the comprador of Dehe Foreign Company to reduce the rent slightly to accommodate the public. The dispute lasted for two or three months, but there was still no solution. They hired lawyer Zheng Yuxiu to prepare legal action. On one hand, the tenants automatically deposited the rent into the China Bank in Baxianqiao. On the other hand, the General Union of Tenants of the French Concession sent a written warning to the landlord. Later, Yu Qiaqing and Shang Mu Jiang came forward to mediate. After repeated consultations, they agreed to reduce the rent for market houses by 10 to 15 yuan and the rent for residential houses by 8 to 9 yuan. There would be no increase or decrease within four years from the date of the lease. The reply letter from Yu was received yesterday, and Lawyer Zheng stamped it to certify it and took 100 photos to distribute to the tenants for safekeeping. All unpaid rent will be collected in the name of Yin Ji. The tenants' representatives also resolved at a meeting: (1) The name of the Yin Yu Lane Tenants' Union will be preserved forever. (2) More than a dozen large and small silver shields will be made and given to Yu, Shang, Wang, Chen, Zhu, and Wei and others who contributed to the effort. (3) Representatives will be invited to a celebration banquet on a certain day to report on the progress. (4) A notice of thanks will be published in the newspaper to Yu and Shang and the General Union of Tenants of the French Concession for their assistance. (5) Chairpersons and other executive officers will be elected by the Representative Council to handle union affairs. (6) The 10% public fee collected has not been used and will be permanently deposited in the China Bank for emergencies.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Municipal Bureau of Public Works Plans Routes <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>▲ Xiangzha Road: Since the Municipal Government determined the downtown area, the Bureau of Public Works has been planning various routes. The Xiangzha Road starts from Diswei Road, uses the entire line of Yangjiabang Road in the Zhabei District road system, crosses the Shajing Port, passes Chenjiazha, Hongjiazha, and ends at the intersection of Xiangyin Road and Songhu Road. The entire road is more than five kilometers long and is a main road connecting the downtown area to the concession. It is now reported that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has completed the route plan. The width of the road is stipulated to be 35 meters from Shajing Port to Xiangyin Road. The original width of Yangjiabang Road, 15.3 meters, will be maintained west of Shajing Port to Diswei Road. However, the baseline on both sides is still set at 35 meters so that when traffic increases in the future and the original width is insufficient, it can still be widened without the difficulty of demolishing houses.</p>
<p>▲ Yanpu Road: The original roads along the outer Bund of the 16th Pier of Damada Wharf and the Datong Wharf south of Dongjiadu were of varying widths. Goods were piled up along the road, and vehicles could not pass. The traffic on the outer Bund was becoming increasingly congested. Now, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works plans to take advantage of the city's reorganization of the Yanpu coastline and public land to plan the route from the 16th Pier to Dongjiadu in detail, so that vehicles for wharves and warehouses can use the road for parking in the future, thereby reducing congestion on the outer Bund and benefiting traffic. The bureau has drawn a detailed map of the route and submitted it to the municipal government for review and approval. The segment of the road near Pu浜 has been submitted to the Municipal Council meeting for decision and is stipulated to be 93 meters wide.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Application for Certificates by French Lawyers <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Special District Court in the Public Concession, there has been no shortage of foreign lawyers applying to the Judicial Yuan for lawyer certificates. It was recently learned that two French lawyers from the French Concession, Mr. Tibbek and Mrs. Yao Guolan, also entrusted Chen Shiguang, the director of the Diplomatic Ministry's Shanghai Office, to apply to the Judicial Yuan for two lawyer certificates on their behalf, in order to practice law. It is said that this is the first time that lawyers from the French Concession have applied for certificates.</p>
<h3 id="e163">New Chinese Lawyer Hired by the Municipal Council <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>▲ Hu Jiabao</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Special District Court in the Public Concession, it has been stipulated that there are as many as five criminal courts. As a result, the original lawyers representing the police force in court every day were found to be insufficient. Recently, lawyer Hu Jiabao has been newly hired to assist in handling cases. Mr. Hu graduated from Soochow University with a Bachelor of Laws degree. From now on, the Municipal Council will have six lawyers specializing in appearing in the Special District Court and the Higher Branch Court. Among them, Mr. Bolian is American, Mr. Wei Yinde is British, and the remaining four, Ru Bao Yi, Gan Jingxian, Wang Yaotang, and the newly hired Hu Jiabao, are all Chinese. It is said that Wang Yaotang was also recently hired by the bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Special District Court Issues Audience Tickets <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>▲ Those Unrelated Are Not Allowed to Enter the Court</p>
<p>▲ One Ticket Limited to One Court</p>
<p>Because during the daily hearings of civil and criminal cases in the Special District Court, unrelated non-litigants often intrude into the court, it has become necessary to slightly restrict access. Therefore, starting yesterday, anyone wishing to attend must obtain an audience ticket. The ticket is specially made by the court with a white background and red characters, marked with the court number, "Audience Ticket," the date, and "Void After One Day." The bailiffs or court clerks of each court are responsible for issuing the tickets. The bailiffs will first inquire about the case and the relationship of the person attending, and then issue an audience ticket. If it is found that the person is completely unrelated, they will not be given a ticket and will be barred from the court. Moreover, since the ticket has the court number printed on it, it is not allowed to use a ticket from Court A to enter Court B. When leaving, the ticket holders must return the original ticket to prevent misuse. The Special District Court has five civil courts and five criminal courts, so if all ten courts are open every day, nearly a thousand audience tickets will be needed. At the very least, it will be more than five hundred. Calculated over the whole year, the cost will be considerable. It is said that the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court will also implement this method, which can reduce the chaos in the courtroom during trial proceedings.</p>

<p>▲ Arrested on North Sichuan Road</p>
<p>▲ Public Security Bureau Dispatches Detectives to Transfer</p>
<p>After Wang Bin-yan's son, Xiaoda, was kidnapped, the bandits demanded a ransom of 300,000 yuan, as repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Since the case occurred, the military and police agencies of both the Chinese and foreign concessions have been investigating, but after several days, the whereabouts of the victim are still unknown. According to detective Zhang Guisheng of the Dixiwei Road police station, Qiu Huicai, a member of the Six Harmonies Society residing on the upper floor of the barbershop at 1166 North Sichuan Road, is highly involved in the case. He was secretly arrested on the morning of the day before yesterday at 10:30 AM. Because the kidnapping of Prince Wang took place on Xinmin Road in Zhabei, the police station notified the responsible Public Security Bureau. Yesterday morning, Wu Xinyi, a patrol officer from the First Branch of the Fourth District of Zhabei, delivered a letter to the Third Court of the Special District Court, which was hearing the case, requesting a transfer. Subsequently, Judge Feng ordered the arrest of Qiu for questioning. He also instructed Officer Wu that a formal official document should be prepared for the transfer of a suspect from the interior, as this is the legal procedure. The defendant is being temporarily detained, awaiting the official document from the Public Security Bureau for further investigation. Therefore, the police returned Qiu to the police station for detention.</p>

<p>Dr. E. Bnranet, Director of the Leprosy Department of the Health Section of the League of Nations in Geneva, visited the China Leprosy Relief Association at 20 Museum Road in this city when he passed through Shanghai at the beginning of this month to attend the International Medical Conference in Tokyo. He asked the association to help him inspect the prevalence of leprosy in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The association responded to his request and was willing to do its best to assist. At that time, due to the ship schedule, Dr. White only stayed in Shanghai for a few hours before hastily departing for Japan to attend the International Medical Conference. Now that the conference has ended, Dr. White sent a letter to the China Leprosy Relief Association yesterday, saying that he could arrive in Shanghai on the 18th (yesterday). After receiving the letter, the Leprosy Association immediately consulted with Dr. Mai Yagu, the Far East representative of the International Leprosy Relief Association, to jointly receive him and arrange his schedule. It is said that he will attend the Chinese Medical Conference in Shanghai, give a special lecture, and visit the leprosy clinic in the Hongkou Commune on Linping Road, visit the director of the Shanghai Health Bureau, and also plan to visit the leprosy hospital in Hangzhou and visit the Minister of Health in Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Verdict in the Yan Ruling Kidnapping Case <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>▲ Seven Criminals Sentenced to Five Years Each</p>
<p>▲ Sent to Mainland Court for Punishment</p>
<p>Yan Ruling, the comprador of the former French and Chinese Oriental Fur Company, was kidnapped by bandits some time ago in his new house on Route Lafayette and taken to a bandit den in a foreign house at No. 356 Jin Shenfu Road. Later, detective inspector Jin Jiulin and chief detective Li Yaolong of the French police station discovered the den, rescued the victim, and arrested the kidnappers Zhang Hongxiang, Lu Peizhou, Wang A'gen, Fang Youshan, Tao Jinbao, Luo Shisheng, Chen Liangen, Wang A'da, and the suspect Zhao Renmao, a total of nine people. Three pistols and one Mauser pistol were seized. The details of the interrogation in the French Public Court have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday, they were brought in for questioning again. According to Zhang Hongxiang and others, the driver Wang A'gen did indeed help drive the car during the kidnapping of the plaintiff. The plaintiff's representative, lawyer Ba He, stated that the kidnappers in the case have all admitted their guilt without denial. It was found that the second defendant, Lu Peizhou, is a relative of the plaintiff. The plaintiff's kidnapping was entirely instigated by Lu alone, who had led the accomplices to the new house to identify the plaintiff's appearance. He had also conspired with the gang to kidnap his brother, Liu Chengxiao, and Qian Changgan, etc. last year. At a time when kidnapping is rampant and the social atmosphere is deteriorating, the court should severely punish them to deter lawbreakers. At this point, the Chinese and Western officials ordered Zhang Fuqing to be brought to court and asked, "Do you owe your cousin Zhang Hongxiang 400 yuan and eight rickshaws? If so, you can return them to his wife to help her make a living." Zhang Fuqing replied, "I have been working as a detective in the mainland. Zhang Hongxiang was once arrested by me, so he falsely accused me out of resentment. I do not owe him a penny. Moreover, Zhang Hongxiang's money was obtained by kidnapping and risking his life. If I were to covet this money, my heart would be ten times more vicious than his. Please investigate." The official asked Zhang Hongxiang if he had any loan receipts. Zhang replied that he had no receipts. Presiding Judge Zhu then consulted with French Consul Du and sentenced Zhang Hongxiang, Lu Peizhou, Wang A'gen, Fang Youshan, Tao Jinbao, Luo Shisheng, and Chen Liangen, seven people in total, to five years in the Western prison for the crime of violating Article 371 of the criminal law, to be deported and sent to the mainland court for punishment. Wang A'da was sentenced to five years and deported. The seized pistols and Mauser pistol were confiscated. Zhao Renmao was released as he was not involved.</p>

<p>A female corpse was found floating on the seashore east of the Wusong Fort yesterday morning at around 7:00 AM. The local bailiff, Zhang A'mao, retrieved the corpse and reported it to the Baoshan County Government. County Magistrate Wu dispatched personnel at 1:00 PM to inspect the body. It was found that the corpse was about 30 years old, with no injuries on the body. She was wearing blue cloth shirt and pants, barefoot, and had nothing in her pockets. After the inspection, the county government prepared a coffin and collected the body, waiting for her family to identify it.</p>

<p>A Shandong boy named Liu Xiaozhu, 13 years old, used to live in Qingdao. Because his mother died early, his father remarried. Recently, his father's livelihood has become increasingly difficult, so he joined the army. His stepmother is inherently fierce and often beats him. Liu, unable to bear the abuse, secretly ran away. The day before yesterday, he came to Shanghai by boat. After landing, he planned to go to his aunt's husband, Zhang Qiangzhen's, grocery store near the South Railway Station. However, he did not know the way and wandered around Wangjia Wharf in Nanshi. Later, he remembered that there was an old people's home in Shanghai that could take him in, so he asked the guard at the 15th post where the address was. The policeman knew that something was wrong and inquired about his background. He took him back to the First Branch of the First District and was ordered to submit a written report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for placement.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government recently approved a consultation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, approving a telegram from the Jiangxi Provincial Government stating that the province is currently conducting a large-scale suppression of bandits. It is inconvenient for foreigners to travel to Jiangxi. The ministry is requested to instruct all passport-issuing agencies to temporarily suspend the issuance of passports. Those who have already obtained passports are requested to be notified not to lightly travel to unstable areas to avoid danger and show due caution, etc. Upon approval, in addition to sending consultations to various provincial governments for information, a corresponding letter is sent to you for your review and to instruct your subordinates to comply, etc. It is said that after receiving the consultation, the municipal government has already ordered the Public Security Bureau to comply with the instructions.</p>

<p>▲ Woman in Critical Condition, Man Unharmed</p>
<p>Shen Zhongtao, from Zhenjiang, residing at 453 Ziyang Lane, Huishan Road, used to work as a partner at Jiu Kang Cloth Store in his hometown. Later, due to the closure of the store, he brought his wife, Yin, to Shanghai last year, hoping to find a business. However, he was unsuccessful and has been unemployed ever since. All their clothes and ornaments have been pawned. Although Ms. Yin was recommended to work as a female worker at the Huaping Cigarette Factory, and is a novice, her income is meager and insufficient to cover expenses. Quarrels are often heard in the family. Yesterday morning, the couple quarreled again. Ms. Yin, feeling depressed, secretly took opium paste to end her life. Shen discovered it and accompanied her to the Civilian Hospital, then transferred her to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that her life is in danger.</p>
<p>Sun Yuanli, a Ningbo native, 42 years old, lives at 901 Ou Pengjia Road, Hongkou. His son, Qingmiao, 20 years old, used to serve on Yangtze River ships. Because he was addicted to gambling, he was dismissed and worked as a clerk in his father's Meili Dyeing Workshop (492 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei). Recently, he relapsed into his old habits and lost a lot of money. His father discovered this and severely reprimanded him. In a fit of frustration, Qingmiao secretly took raw opium to kill himself at around 4:00 PM yesterday. He was discovered and hired a streetcar to send him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Because the poisoning was mild, he was unharmed.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Dr. Chu's Notes on Overseas Anecdotes <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>Mr. Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, is known for promoting hygiene education. This time, he represented the country in Belgium. I was sent to Europe by the Ministry and set off on the same ship. I had the opportunity to personally listen to his teachings. Besides teaching French and practicing Tai Chi on the Astor ship every day, Mr. Chu also narrated his experiences in Europe endlessly. Here are some of his overseas anecdotes to share with readers.</p>
<p>▲ Language Master The most popular languages in the world are English, German, and French. The Americas and Australia have the same language, which has a wider scope. Therefore, Americans and British people who can speak more than two languages are very rare. People in countries such as Poland, Denmark, Switzerland, and the Netherlands can often understand more than ten languages. Therefore, language masters should belong to small European countries.</p>
<p>▲ Truth, Goodness, and Beauty Our physical health depends entirely on both hygiene and physical education. One is a fundamental solution, and the other is a temporary solution. Neither can be overemphasized. European women all like to dress up brightly, paint their lips, and cover their faces with powder, thinking that they are doing their best to be beautiful. How can they know that if it is not natural, there is no so-called beauty? Therefore, people with healthy bodies often have blood on their faces. Otherwise, it becomes false beauty rather than true beauty.</p>
<p>▲ Wearing Mourning on Fingers Europeans wear black gauze around their arms to express their sorrow, which is like wearing plain clothes and mourning in our country. It is common to see unhygienic people who do not trim their nails, and dirt accumulates, gradually forming black circles. Europeans call this wearing mourning on their fingers. We must pay attention to this.</p>
<p>▲ At a Loss for Words London, the capital of England, has a humid climate. Except for April, May, June and July, it rains all year round. Dense fog pervades, and sometimes you can't see your fingers when you hold out your hand. We feel lost. If we are physically weak, we will definitely get sick.</p>
<p>▲ Relying on Heaven Our country does not pay attention to hygiene, and it has gradually become a habit. Fortunately, our natural environment is superior to Europe. The climate is mild, the products are abundant, and the sunlight kills germs. As the saying goes, "Relying on heaven for food" is true. We should strive for scientific construction in order to create a perfect China.</p>
<p>▲ Labor is Sacred Our people are known to the world for their hard work and frugality. The opening of the Panama Canal, the Chinese laborers in the European War, and the reclamation of Africa have given great benefits to the people of the world and created international glory. We should build on our inherent virtues, develop them and enhance them.</p>
<h3 id="e177">洞仙歌 <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Jimeng from Xiashi sent a letter inquiring about the seven Southern Wild lyrics by Shen Taimou, compiled by Mr. Hu Puan in the Southern Society Anthology. The first five were "Dong Xian Ge," which was similar to Xu's old work "Silver Chamber Loneliness." The letter asked who the original author was, etc. According to my recollection, Taimou was an old friend of Xu's, and we were in the same society twenty years ago. We often composed and harmonized to this melody as Xu's work for his wife, which was published in the "Zhuo Zuo Lin" of the Wushen year. At that time, Yang Gu Yun and Shen Taimou both had harmonized versions. I don't know how the original work of Xu was mistakenly published as Nan Ya's work in the Southern Society collection. Someone had inquired about this matter in a letter before, seemingly in the fifth collection of the Southern Society ten years ago. At that time, Nan Ya was still alive. Xu then wrote a Ci-hua (poetry talk) in the "Freedom Forum," saying that his disciple Teng Zhixin mistakenly published four "Dong Xian Ge" poems, composed in harmony between Xu and Yi Shifu. He wrongly took Shifu's "Sea Red Curtain Outside" as Xu's original song and Xu's harmonized work as Shifu's harmonization. It was not until the second edition that the error was corrected. Generally, it was due to mistakes in transcription at the time, misreading handwriting. There are many such cases in ancient collections. For example, "The irresistible fall of flowers," and "The familiar returning swallows." Who was the original author remains unproven. This is also a good story in the history of Ci. Therefore, I pick up the old tune to mourn Nan Ya. The poem says: Once parted from the human world, further than Penglai Mountain. Old things should not be mentioned, like a white fan. (Around the founding of the Republic, Taimou wanted to write a legend about a Miss Bai, but Taimou wrote to say that this lady had married, so please stop writing.) The deep red feelings, the green meanings, the willows dark and flowers bright, have all become poems of meeting again in another life. Now, the goddess of Luo River has ascended to heaven, and old Chen Si (Cao Zhi) is aging. A hundred years of fleeting time have passed more than half. Only the white-haired sighs remain, drawing and sewing on paper, yet there is no use for Zhaoyun (a concubine of Su Shi) to accompany. If it weren't for Su Dongpo's understanding of Zen, perhaps through several ups and downs, the heart would break the same way.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Bansong Garden Orchid Appreciation Record <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Yinong</p>
<p>I have a lifelong passion for orchids. If a friend cultivates orchids, I always invite myself to appreciate them. On the third day of the Flower Festival, there was an orchid competition at Bansong Garden. I was delighted to hear about it because I had been living in the noisy city of Shanghai, feeling uneasy and restless. I had long wanted to find a secluded place to breathe fresh air. On that day, I went with my friends Li Xueou and Lin Lihu by car. Upon arriving at Bansong Garden, we entered and walked around a winding corridor. Immediately, we smelled a unique fragrance. Upon reaching the hall, it felt like entering a garden of nine acres, clean and dust-free, fragrant and lovely. Graceful and elegant, charming and graceful, orchids were displayed all around, arranged in varying heights. There were more than two hundred pots of orchids. The flower petals had the shapes of lotus petals, plum petals, and crabapple petals. The flower centers had plain centers, red centers, and purple centers. The colors varied: jade, emerald, and light lake green. Famous varieties were scattered everywhere, each with its own unique charm. The leaves swayed gracefully, and the flowers seemed to smile charmingly. I and my friends drank tea among them, appreciating them in silence. I only felt that the fragrance was quiet and solemn, and the teeth and cheeks retained the fragrance. Mr. Li Xueou said, "All flowers have fragrance, but only the fragrance of orchids is rich and clear. All flowers have color, but only the color of orchids is deep green and beautiful. Therefore, in the cliffs and empty valleys, they sprout and take root, not fragrant just because no one is around. Orchids are the fragrance of the nation, and are worthy of treasuring. Among them, the most precious and lovely is a kind with ochre and ink colors, the flower luster is ancient and lush, and the charm is serene and elegant, which is especially admired by me, similar to the Guanyin orchid of Guangdong. I saw it once in the 'Spring Retention' painting by the Old Man Hong Zili. It is also rare among orchid cultivators in Shanghai." I then recalled the dozens of orchids I had cultivated at home, all of which were excellent varieties from Fujian and Guangdong. Over the years, I have been occupied with matters and have not been able to settle down. So I left the orchids to face the wind and snow, without caring for or watering them. Seeing these orchids today, I cannot help but sigh. I also wonder what my beloved orchids at home are like today. Recently, the orchid cultivators in Shanghai have each presented their fine works for competition. Their efforts in cultivation have not been small. I and my friends sat silently, sketching flowers, feeling the fragrance surrounding the brush and ink. Lin Lihu painted them, vividly resembling their shapes. Their tranquility is like that of fairies, their gracefulness is like that of beauties, their purity is like that of high scholars, and their elegance is like that of poets. It is difficult to distinguish the flowers from the paintings at first glance. Isn't this the ultimate skill of the divine craftsmanship? I then composed three quatrains to praise them, which are appended below. The spring breeze is light and unrestrained, with a faint fragrance that is charming. The jade soul and ice spirit have traces of the moon. The quality of the flowers should be pure and elegant, and the worldly dust should not be allowed to reach this famous garden. A branch of unique and extraordinary flowers sprouts. I have long admired the "Spring Retention" painting. Now, I meet the fragrant tracks in person, revealing the flower luster that is unparalleled in the world. How is the scenery of my hometown recently? I dream of the sparse shadows of flowers in the courtyard. For ten years, I have written complaints in vain, longing to build a hut with a cloud-covered hoe.</p>

<p>Mr. Xu was gentle and refined. He worked at the "Xinwenbao" for more than ten years. His friends and colleagues all loved and respected him. One evening this spring, on his way home from the newspaper office, he was ambushed by thugs. Everyone who heard of it felt grief and regret.</p>

<p>Mr. Lianfang was from a prominent family in Jingjiang. His respected father was a Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations) and served as the magistrate of important counties. Lianfang presided over local public affairs and founded the Jicheng Daily and various industries. He had the style of Zhang Nantong (Zhang Jian). Public opinion was unanimous. He excelled at poetry and prose, and his calligraphy in the regular script style captured the essence of Li Bei Hai (Li Yong). In the late Qing Dynasty, I was the English lecturer at the Jingjiang School. We often visited each other. Recently, Lianfang was in charge of compiling the Jingjiang County Annals. Before his talent could be fully realized, he suddenly passed away. I was shocked to hear the news and wrote a couplet to mourn him.</p>
<p>Recalling past travels like geese alighting on snow, small gatherings with zithers and wine, I was honored to be a guest in Li Bei Hai's presence.</p>
<p>A prominent figure was promoted in Ji Sha, greatly promoting the atmosphere, and was a person who could be written about in Nantong's biography.</p>
<h3 id="e181">The Ancestor of Tobacco <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Qiulang</p>
<p>Recently, when friends and relatives meet, in addition to offering tea, they often add cigarettes to show respect. However, according to the old customs of our country, there was originally no tobacco. It was not until the late Ming Dynasty that snuff appeared. This is based on Zhao Zhiqian's "Yonglu Leisure Talk," which states, "Snuff comes from Italy in the Atlantic Ocean. In the ninth year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty, Matteo Ricci sailed into Guangdong and introduced it to China." From this, it is known that snuff was indeed the ancestor of tobacco. It is inhaled through the nose, not held in the mouth. Later, Chinese people researched tobacco materials and made their own water pipes, hand-rolled cigarettes, and other types, each according to their preferences. In recent years, cigarettes have become popular, and the former is almost eliminated, while those who use snuff are even rarer than morning stars. However, snuff was quite popular among high-ranking officials and monks at the time. However, the price was surprisingly high. The best quality cost about fifty taels of gold per tael. It is said that Ouyang Lin, a former official of Jiangxi Province, had a particular addiction to it. Every year, he spent four to five thousand taels of gold on it and had a large collection of snuff bottles, all of which were treasures. He often fondled them for pleasure during his leisure time.</p>

<p>The recent situation is excellent. It is still very crowded every day. Yesterday (Friday), the audience was especially enthusiastic. When "Fen He Wan" was finished, the curtain call was requested as many as seven times because the audience could truly understand it. Those who have heard it spread the word more and more widely. The more people who come to listen, the more they enjoy it. At present, the audience laughs at all the humorous and funny parts of the play, which proves that they can quite understand it.</p>
<p>The entire faculty of Columbia University held a tea party, specially inviting Wanhua (Mei Lanfang) to attend. More than two hundred people attended. The president's wife gave a special reception. Wan gave a speech, saying that he was very honored to be here today, but the purpose of his trip was to study in the United States, like a student. He hoped that all the professors would treat him as a student and not be stingy with their teachings. As for this performance, he was very grateful for the praise and support of the gentlemen, which resulted in a successful outcome. He hoped to receive more guidance in the future, etc. The guests and hosts dispersed happily.</p>
<p>Also, the International Student Association held a public banquet for Wanhua the day before yesterday and invited him to give a speech. More than one thousand people attended. Wan gave an impromptu speech, saying that he had long heard that the United States had established this association, which allowed students of different nationalities to gather together and connect the feelings of various countries. The intention was very good. Lanfang was very happy to be able to come here. This time, he came to the United States to study drama, and his qualifications were the same as those of students. He also wanted to absorb Western civilization and contribute to his motherland. He hoped to receive guidance from time to time.</p>
<p>Currently, small cities in the South have invited him to perform, but each place is mostly short-term, and the procedures for arranging luggage and transportation are complicated and expensive. Therefore, it is planned to perform in New York for five weeks and then rest for ten days in order to travel and visit various theater organizations. Then, he will perform in Chicago for six or seven days and then go to San Francisco. He will stay there for more than a month. (March 6)</p>

<p>The fire fighting in Shanghai is considered quite rapid. In a short while, the fire weakened. Zuo Shichen smiled and said, "Just now, you heard the noisy sounds downstairs. Some people were arguing about a name called Ah Huo. Who knew that it wasn't Ah Huo arguing, but a real fire coming. Didn't I say that water could overcome fire? Now, watering with the water in the leather belt immediately extinguished it. It was all proven in a short while." While watching the fire gradually recede, everyone was a little relieved when a elder sister from the Zhu Feng family across the room, named Ah Bao, ran upstairs, saying, "It's very dangerous! It's very dangerous! Someone almost burned to death!" Hearing this, everyone gathered around to ask, "Sister Ah Bao, who are you talking about?" Ah Bao said, "It's the family where the fire started!" At this time, Ruiyun asked anxiously, "How did the fire start?" Ah Bao said, "I heard them say that the fire started from catching bedbugs. Isn't the family in that alley the family of Gonggong Da Wang Wen Guizhi?" The eldest aunt said, "It's not just the Wen Guizhi family. There are a total of four families in their three-story house." Ah Jin said, "Eldest aunt, don't interrupt her. Let her continue to talk about how the fire started." Ah Bao said, "I also know that there are four families in this alley, but the fire started in the Wen Guizhi family. Wen Guizhi's good mother (grandmother) is a bit hemiplegic. They don't have a small room. Everyone lives in the business area. Wen Guizhi's good mother is not in good health and went to bed early. She woke up at eleven o'clock after being bitten by bedbugs. She got up to catch bedbugs. She slept in the toilet room behind them. They do business, and there is no electric light installed in the toilet room. There was an oil lamp on the table. The old lady fell asleep for a while and felt itchy in her neck. Knowing that it was because of bedbugs, she struck a match and lit the oil lamp to catch bedbugs. When she turned over the pillow, there were indeed several large bedbugs. The old lady's hand was already trembling a little. Seeing the bedbugs, she was anxious to catch them, but she knocked over the oil lamp. You can imagine how powerful kerosene is. It catches fire when it sees fire. The old lady, who is Wen Guizhi's grandmother, saw that the mosquito net was already on fire and quickly tore it down, but other places were also on fire. The old lady was so panicked that she had to shout for help. She splashed water from the washbasin on it, but it wouldn't go out. In a while, the pillow and quilt were all on fire. No matter how hard she tried to extinguish it, she couldn't put it out. The eldest aunt said, "That old lady must have been frightened. Otherwise, she could have just covered it with the quilt and put it out. Cover it with the quilt and don't let it get air. This is a good way. Once, we had a fire in the countryside, and we put it out using this method."</p>

<h3 id="e184">Financial Gold Standard Suddenly Turns Downward <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>▲ Swap quotes show short sellers offering around two taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was generally stable, with daily fluctuations of about three taels. However, interbank trading was not very active. Because the swap market has already reached June, the exchange opened at 8:30 in the morning. The initial swap quote was only 1 tael and 3 or 4 qian, then increased to 2 taels and 1 or 2 qian, and at noon it was 2 taels, all offered by short sellers to long buyers. Because the long side was unwilling to lightly sell off, it was higher than the previous month. As for the May strips, there were no transactions. Most were changed to June as the main month. The opening price in the morning was 502 taels and 2 qian and 5 fen. The closing price at noon was 502 taels and 2 qian, an increase of 4 qian compared to the day before yesterday. This was based on the June price, and the listing was changed. As usual, the suspended listing was cancelled for the after-market.</p>
<p>▲ June gold standard has already entered the market</p>
<p>Yucheng Yong and Yuansheng, among others, have made purchases for June, while Wanxing and Jin'an have sold. The market seemed slightly firmer after the large morning volume decreased slightly. Later, sellers dominated, and the market softened and weakened, fluctuating around 500 taels. There was no significant improvement or deterioration in exchange rates. Later in the market, Fuchang advanced slightly, and Shunli and Yuanxing Yong sold some. However, the foreign exchange market was particularly quiet because it was Wednesday, when there is usually no formal market. Afterwards, the market suddenly became sluggish, and sellers became active, causing the market to decline sharply. It unexpectedly broke below 499 taels from above 500 taels. The psychology of traders turned sparse.</p>
<p>▲ Noon closing still outside the 500 tael mark</p>
<p>Yesterday, the recent British silver bar remained unchanged, and the forward price decreased by one-sixteenth. The silver price also decreased by one-fourth. The opening price for the June gold standard was 500 taels and 3 qian. Then, there were fluctuations of more than one tael. Transactions within the market moved in and out rapidly. The gross price fell from 501 taels and 1 qian to 499 taels and a half. Because the exchange rate remained stable, the June British gold bank paid 11 pence 3125 when the initial price was announced, so the price was 500 taels 8 qian 9 fen. The price did not change. The internal price seemed firm. China Bank sold 1.04625 taels of June gold, and soon after, Mitsui sold 1.0425 taels of July. East Asia offered forward British gold at 11 pence 3125. There were still many sellers on the table, and the price immediately depreciated by two taels. After 10:30, the price was 500 taels. After 11:00, the market was quite flat. Then, Yucheng Yong and others bought in. Maijia Li absorbed the forward British gold at 11 pence 3125, so it was slightly better by 3 or 4 qian. At 11:45, the price was 500 taels and 4 qian. Soon after, it dropped slightly. However, the foreign exchange rate stabilized, and transactions were very rare. At the noon closing, the price was 500 taels and 2 qian, and the announced price was still 508 taels and 8 qian, a decrease of more than 8 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Afternoon market suddenly declines, sharply falling by two taels</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 500 taels and 2 qian. Soon after, Indian exchange rates were reported high, and Yuanxing Yong and others hurriedly unloaded their holdings. The market sentiment suddenly weakened, presenting a sluggish appearance. After 3:00, the market fluctuated violently, falling sharply by two taels. The supply on the table exceeded demand. However, because it was Wednesday, various exchange rates lacked a market. At 4:15, it suddenly fell to 98 taels and 3 qian. By 4:30, it had recovered to 98 taels and 7 qian at the closing. The highest price for the day was 501 taels and 1 qian, and the lowest price was 498 taels and 3 qian, a fluctuation of 2 taels and 8 qian. The announced price decreased by 10 taels. The account for the next month was the same at 502 taels for June and 500 taels for the previous month. The water supplement was 502 taels in the morning, and the water supplement was 1 tael. The physical market opened early, with May at 502 taels and June at 500 taels and 3 qian. The noon closing was 2 qian and 1 fen for May and 500 taels and 1 qian for June. In the afternoon, the price for June was 1 qian, and the closing price was Yin 18 taels and 9 qian.</p>
<p>▲ Various firms swap trading</p>
<p>For interbank trading, Zhifeng Yong, Jin'an, Bingxing, Wanxing, and others sold, while Yuansheng, Yuanyu Yong, Yucheng Yong, Yuantai, and Yuda bought. Yuanmaoyong, Yichang, and Taixing traded in and out from time to time. In the afternoon, Yuxing Yong, Fuchang, Wanxing, and retail investors bought in, while Yuanxing Yong, Fuxing Yong, Yuanda, and Yuansheng sold. Shunli, Tongtaichang, and retail investors had mixed activity. Xie Da slightly advanced.

The long buyer Yuantai also completed the swaps for 2,000 strips. The Guang gang Hengxing had little activity other than swap trading.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets shrank slightly. The HSBC listing prices for various exchanges remained unchanged. Overseas telegrams indicated that the markets in Yokohama and Kobe also remained unchanged. The market situation was quite flat. The domestic foreign exchange market seemed loose in the early morning, but then appeared stable. The gold market fluctuated slightly. June has already entered the market. The price revolved around the 500 tael mark. The noon closing price was no better or worse than the previous day. In the afternoon, it was Wednesday, as usual, so the market was closed. However, the gold price suddenly turned downward. Few Chinese merchants and speculators sought supply because they were in the gold standard swap market, with only a small amount of activity. It is estimated that 20,000 to 30,000 pounds of British exchange were closed, and East Asia slightly sold off and threw out 40,000 to 50,000 pounds, which Maijia Li and Shanghai absorbed. The American exchange was very dull, and the Japanese exchange had purchased and closed several hundred thousand yuan. Banks such as Zhenjin, Mitsui, and Shanghai sold, while the Dalian gang slightly sold and appeared Dalian tickets, which Mitsui absorbed. The market situation remained mediocre.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Yarn Market Advances Steadily <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable and the situation is relatively firm. Buyers are taking a strong stance. Due to the approaching delivery dates, speculators without goods have to cover their short positions. Therefore, despite the sharp declines in overseas yarn prices, the local market has not been drawn into the vortex. Most speculators in the market have a bearish outlook due to the unstable political situation and busy agricultural season. However, some manufacturers are secretly acting to reduce stocks of yarn in warehouses. Therefore, it is feared that yarn prices will not fall sharply this month, and the future is uncertain.</p>
<p>▲Man-made Fiber Slightly Rises by Half a Taels. At the opening of the man-made fiber market, sentiment was weak due to the sharp fall in US cotton prices. Most people expected a decline of 700-800 cash. However, after the opening, the near-month bulls held firm, and selling was not strong, with a decline of only 100-200 cash. The situation in the second and third sessions tightened sharply, and prices rose in all months. As a result, near-month contracts rose by 100 cash, while far-month contracts fell by 200 cash. In the afternoon, the market sentiment for man-made fiber became even stronger. It was reported that actual sales were good, and speculators covered their short positions, resulting in increases of 200, 300, 400, and 500 cash. The price of third-grade yarn fell particularly sharply. According to the daily trading statistics, 9,600 bales were traded. The closing prices of man-made fiber are listed below:</p>
<p>Brand　Closing Price　Change　Inventory　Closing Price　Change　Inventory</p>
<p>April　1530 Up 5　36,450　July　1525 Up 3　25,050</p>
<p>May　1514 Up 6　40,450　August　1528 Down 2　19,500</p>
<p>June　1525 Up 5　36,050　September　1533 Up 1　7,900</p>
<p>▲Spot Yarn Business is Better. Sichuan merchants are the most active buyers. According to statistics, various merchants bought a total of 3,040 bales throughout the day. Dealers took in 30 bales. Market conditions are slightly firm. Among customer merchants, Sichuan bought 2,125 bales, Qingdao 190 bales, Inland 250 bales, Guangdong 100 bales, Xiamen 60 bales, Tianjin 160 bales, Xuzhou 60 bales, Qinhuangdao 30 bales, and other merchants took in 65 bales. Factories opened over 1,000 bales, it is said.</p>

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and stabilized in the afternoon. The political turmoil in India expanded, and the price of US and Indian cotton fell sharply. The labor strikes at Japanese yarn factories were also intense. Therefore, it was increasingly difficult to be optimistic about foreign cotton. The local cotton market was particularly weak. Speculators, seeing the poor outlook, closed out their positions. However, Eastern cotton firms continued to hold their near-month purchases, maintaining a firm stance. However, with the sharp decline in foreign cotton prices, it will be difficult for local cotton to maintain its position.</p>
<p>▲Cotton Futures Continued to Fall by 200 Cash. At the opening of the morning market, the price fell following foreign cotton, and sentiment was weak and panicked. Trading was loose, and prices fell by 50 cash to 300 cash in all months. In the afternoon, some profit-takers covered their short positions, and the situation was flat. According to the daily trading statistics, 35,200 dan were traded. The closing prices of Han Standard are recorded below:</p>
<p>Han Standard Closing Price Change Inventory Six 3500 Down 25 73,400</p>
<p>Four 3565 Down 5 57,300 Seven 3505 Down 25 62,800</p>
<p>Five 3515 Down 15 87,300 Eight 3505 Down 20 55,200</p>
<p>▲Spot Cotton Demand is Scattered. Factories are taking a wait-and-see approach. Transactions are quiet. In addition, the sharp decline in foreign cotton prices has forced market prices to follow the downward trend. Sources include 550 bales of Yao Flower and 800 bales of Tong Flower. Sales are recorded below:</p>
<p>Fire Engine Flower 35.50 Eastern Cotton Firm took in 1,200 dan Delivered now to the packing plant</p>
<p>Shaanxi Flower 35.80 Fellow merchants took in 100 pieces Spot delivery from warehouse</p>

<p>▲US Cotton Bulls Closed Out Positions. Yesterday, US cotton was affected by poor news from Liverpool, bulls closed out positions, and the weather was good, resulting in a weak market. Futures fell by 23 to 34 points, and spot prices fell by 35 points. UK cotton futures fell by 14-15 points, and spot prices fell by 16 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 10 points. Indian cotton fell slightly due to the fall in US cotton prices. Local shorts sold, and bulls closed out positions, resulting in a weak market. Pingguo'er fell by 10 rupees, far-term contracts fell by 9 rupees, Aomula near- and far-term contracts fell by 11 rupees, Bairoxi fell by 12 rupees, and far-term contracts fell by 11 rupees.

<h3 id="e196">Grains: Rice Market Suddenly Rises by 200 Cash <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>▲Zhabei: Yesterday, few merchants arrived, and accumulated stocks were becoming scarce due to active sales. Demand for Northern Japonica rice was particularly strong. Retail shops were very eager to buy. Merchants gradually began to sell at higher prices because the supply from inland areas was dwindling and production prices were firm. Recently, rice boats traveling from inland areas to Shanghai were sometimes detained en route due to misunderstandings. Some boatmen changed their plans and sold their rice along the way. At the same time, some boats stopped transporting rice due to banditry. As a result, the supply of rice arriving in Shanghai has been very limited lately. Therefore, the previously sluggish Japonica rice market has suddenly risen by 200 cash. The supply of Bo-dao rice is also scarce, and prices are improving. Yangxian rice has also risen sharply, and buyers are actively searching for it, with prices rising by about 200 cash. Du-ke-bu and other types of Xian rice are still sluggish. Although the market was initially uninspired, it has now strengthened along with other commodities. High-quality rice is opening at around 18 yuan.</p>
<p>▲Hu-nan: The rice market was initially stable but tightened later. Buying interest in the morning market was moderate. However, the market improved after news of price increases from the north. The arrival of rice from the river areas was very limited. Changshu and Wuxi Japonica rice prices increased due to active sales. Su-tong-ji Japonica rice sales in the street were moderate. Large-scale transactions were high, but smaller ones were stable. The sales of Qingjiao and Xi-yong Bo-dao rice from the south were slightly brisk. Arrivals were limited, and prices rose by about 100 cash. Early rice sales were also brisk. The high-quality rice mentioned above opened at around 18 yuan. Yangxian rice stocks were dwindling, and supplies were not smooth. Market sentiment shifted from stable to firm and expensive. Customer merchants and rural sales were paying close attention. Furthermore, with the price of foreign rice rising steadily, domestic Xian rice felt particularly desirable. Prices rose by 150 cash. Shadow market transactions were slightly better, with buyers carefully selecting high-quality rice, reaching a market price of 16.90 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Futures Foreign Rice Continues to Rise <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market conditions were even better. Sales to Nanjing, Changshu, Wuxi, and Kunshan were particularly strong, sales to Hangzhou were slightly lighter, and sales to Ningbo and Shaoxing were intermittent. Sales in this street were also good. 10,000 bags of spot rice were opened. Foreign rice futures firms shouted higher prices and were unwilling to sell much because people's hearts were getting better and better. Returned rice was increasingly firm. As a result, spot rice and rice in transit rose by 150 cash to 200 cash, and futures rose by 560 cash to 890 cash. Number One Saigon was 15.75 yuan, small-lot rice was 15.15 yuan, large-lot rice was 15 yuan, and Min-dang was 15.20 yuan. Small-lot rice in transit also reached 15.10 yuan. The small-lot futures rice market was particularly good, with over 2,000 tons opened, and April and May contracts were already above 7.2 taels, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Flour Market Near-Term Flat, Distant-Term Weak <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was generally flat and weak. The near-term contract reached a low of 2.5375 taels this month, but then recovered slightly as speculators covered their short positions, even though actual sales were not good. As for the distant-term contracts, the outlook for the various months was bright due to the clear weather and warmer climate. General inland bulls were hesitant to take further positions, as the relationship between sunny and rainy weather and the annual wheat harvest seemed to be a widespread consideration. However, although distant-term market values were high, manufacturers' sales were still not smooth. In addition, the peak price of rice repeatedly reached new highs, making it difficult for all inland merchants to overcome at once. As a result, the near-term contract was up 2.5 cash from the previous day, May down 2.5 cash, June down 7.5 cash, July down 10 cash, August down 7.5 cash, and September down 5 cash, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Green and Yellow Wheat Market Softens <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures uniformly softened. Problems had arisen with settlement for the near-term contract, and there was no longer any intention to continue delivery for this month. Although the arrival of high-quality goods from various sources in recent days was not large, inventories were gradually increasing. Therefore, people's hearts were weakened, and many people were selling. This phenomenon during the green and yellow season was good news for a portion of the people's diet. The outlook for distant-term contracts in the various months had changed due to the clear weather, and previous concerns about rain had now changed their outlook. Furthermore, prices for new goods arriving at this price were so high that they could not go any higher, as they were too close to the price of old goods, making them too risky. Therefore, sellers in the various months became more active, and the market gradually fell. As a result, April and June contracts were down 30 cash from the previous day, July down 20 cash, and August and September contracts each down 30 cash. As for spot wheat, only Fuxin was still able to continue purchasing due to the current factory appetite. Most others were watching due to weak flour sales. Therefore, the prices of various grades fell sharply, differing by 100 cash from the highest prices of the previous week. Wheat from Qingjiangpu and Suzhou opened at 5.1 taels and 5.07 taels, Shaoxing wheat at 5.06 taels, and Anqing and Jiangxi wheat at 5.02 taels, 5.0 taels, 4.8 taels, and 4.6 taels, for a total of 9,000 bags, which were purchased by factories such as Fuxin, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Recent News on New Tea from Wu and Qi <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>▲Wu-yi: The tea bushes in Zhouyuan have shown green buds in the last ten days due to continuous spring rains and warm weather. After yesterday becoming extremely hot, both old and new tea bushes were showing green tips. The early ones were growing like sparrow tongues. Tea that was fertilized, loosened, weeded, etc., was especially lush and green. Mountain tea and tea that had been damaged by snow last winter had not yet sprouted. Yesterday (the 7th), a sudden wind and hail storm struck, and many of the tea buds that had sprouted were knocked off. According to tea farmers, the tea leaves were damaged by this storm, and the harvest would have to be reduced by another tenth.</p>
<p>▲Qi-fu: Recently, the development of black tea has been rapid due to the warm weather and intermittent rain and sunshine. The earliest tea leaves can be harvested in the middle of the month. Tea masters and workers from various firms are heading into the mountains to prepare for the opening of the season. However, due to the lack of current cash in Jingzhen and Tunxi, most firms have not yet received all of their funds. In addition, tea houses have tightened their foreign exchange lending. This year, only Zhongxin and Chunshen firms are going into the mountains to receive customers and issue tickets. The remaining firms are still watching. Therefore, the originally planned continuation of tea houses in Fudi has been temporarily suspended due to the impact of the tight money supply. Overall, the number of tea houses in Fudi has been reduced by five-tenths compared to the old days, and the market appears to be in a downturn.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Piece Goods: Fine Cloth and Fine Twill Prices Vary <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>▲Local Cotton Cloth: Yesterday, the price of fine cloth continued to rise. However, inventories had increased. Blue Flying Fish was still opening at 7.15 taels, and Trumpet Boy, Four Soldiers, Colored Ball, Yang He, and Blue Double Fish were all opening at 6.95 taels. Blue Chicken and God of Wealth were both at 6.7 taels. However, fine twill was trending downwards. Blue Double Fish continued to fall slightly by 25 cash yesterday, opening at 6.45 taels. Yang He was still opening at 7.00 taels because it was being sold to Guangdong merchants in large quantities. The North merchants were watching coarse cloth, which was extremely weak. Sales in the Yangtze River basin were limited, resulting in a lack of excitement. 11-pound Three Cats and Three Deer were both selling for 4.6 taels, and Si-ping Lotus was opening at 6.5 taels. Sales of 9-pound cloth were even quieter. This street had slightly increased its purchases of 16-pound goods.</p>
<p>▲Eastern and Western Piece Goods: The previously firm Yuan-yang yarn has gradually softened. Dian-qiu-xiang at 8.4 taels has entered customs. Zi-jin-shan at 7.975 taels. The number of 84 cloth being re-dyed is gradually increasing, selling for only about 6.5 taels. Blue-striped Se-ting has been unusually sluggish and has fallen by 25 cash. Straight-weave satin and fine serge are also soft. However, Moganshan straight-weave flannel has suddenly risen by 25 cash, selling for 265 cash yesterday. Sanyou map has fallen, opening at 227.5 cash. Bleached cloth and fine cloth are still firm. Printed and dyed straight-weave flannel has also risen. Sun Beauty in assorted colors is 275 cash, bald dark colors 285 cash. Bald red has almost disappeared. Western merchants and Sichuan merchants bought over 20 pieces of white-striped hemp yarn yesterday. Prices have not changed much, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Sugar Market: New York Sugar Prices Rise Sharply <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>▲Coarse Sand White Slices Turn Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to information from the sugar-producing areas, the price of Cuban spot sugar was 1.65625, a sharp drop of 0.21875 from the previous telegram. The price of New York sugar futures for May was 1.66, and for September was 1.78, both rising sharply by 6 points. The price for December was 1.88, up 7 points. The price of the next-degree March contract was 1.95, also rising sharply by 9 points. The prices of Javanese spot sugar and April sugar futures were still 10.375, May was 10.625, and June was 10.50, with no increases or decreases. The Association's market for slices and Dutch sugar number 24 for coarse white sand. Due to the rise in the foreign market, the buyer's intention to buy has increased slightly. The transaction price is still 7.175 taels, and the transaction is very frequent. The market situation is quite firm. Number 20 medium white sand is 7 taels. The market is relatively flat. Japanese sugar YT mark is 7.6 taels, XP mark is 7.8 taels. Transactions are sluggish and the market is flat. The brand market only opened a hundred or so bags of Guohuo Mianhuo red, priced at 7.6 taels. The market is similar to the previous day, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Oil Market: White Tung Oil in Hankou Gradually Falls <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>In the past half month, the source of white tung oil in Hankou has been quite strong. Xiangtung has fallen, opening at 23.4 taels. Xiangtung 23.2 taels. Chuantung 24.4 taels. The number of customers in foreign companies is very small. Since 25.7 taels, there has been no transaction in the past ten days, and the market has been quite silent. It is heard that foreign companies in Shanghai have no intention of lowering prices for 25.7-25.8 taels, and their desire for lower prices seems to be stronger than that of Hankou. However, due to the high prices in Zhejiang, it is not easy to fall too much. Therefore, it has not been allowed to approach for a while. Yesterday, according to the Hankou telegram, foreign companies bought 400-500 tons, priced at 25 taels in foreign regulations. According to the source, the stock has been rising strongly, with an estimated tens of thousands of dan. Customer demand has not yet been opened. In addition, there are tens of thousands of dan of Xiangtung that are already on the way and will arrive soon. If this batch arrives, if the foreign market does not trade, the market may have to fall further, it is also not known.</p>
