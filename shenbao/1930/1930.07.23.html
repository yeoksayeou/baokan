<p>時評</p>
<h3>抵抗之反動</h3>
<p>歐戰之時。富强之族。有所需於貧弱。故歐戰以後。貧弱者抵抗富强之氣大盛。當時富强者之原氣未復。潮流所趨。不得不優容而敷衍之。及至今日。漸漸抵抗之風潮。巳生反動。其反動維何。即仍欲强壓之手段。消弭其抵抗也。</p>
<p>使曰非是。試觀近日之印度。試觀埃及。試觀安南。試觀高麗。試觀芬蘭。試觀德國之鐵兜黨。試觀意國之棒喝黨。其意義與舉動之趨向。可以見矣。蓋其重視力。與重視平之心。早已有所轉移也。古人有言。世間萬事。固無平不陂無往不復者。潮流而生反動。亦尋常而非怪異之事。第以潮流之所以有反動。必前之潮流旣經暢達。風靡一時而過其分。然後乃有後之新潮流發生。以爲之反抗。世界之變遷。即由此一起一伏而推進。若前之潮流之實尚未明效大騐。而後之反動之潮流。即緣而生。則他日反動之反動。必將因以更烈。蓋以世界之成一潮流。斷非偶然之事。其氣尚未宣發。而即欲遏抑。恐非所能也。</p>

<h3>美特會核准倫敦海約</h3>
<p>熱浪有以促成</p>
<p>秘件案暫保留</p>
<p>美聯二十一日華盛頓電美參院特會以五十八票對九票追認倫敦限制海軍協約、參議員諾烈斯氏所提議之關於秘密文件保留案、亦附帶通過、政府派雖早已料定海約之票决、可於今日實行、而贊成票數若此之多、則大出望外、故今日莫不喜形於色、謂即此可見胡佛總統外交政策之洽人心、至諾烈斯保留條件、則並不足視爲此次勝利之缺點、因該項條件、僅爲參院防範受海約明文以外秘密文件之拘束而設耳云云、按政府派以前力主海約無條件的通過、而反對派則提出十一條保留條件、以阻撓該約之通過、諾烈斯保留提案、實爲調濟雙方意見之折衷辦法、胡佛總統亦經謦方、所有秘密文件、並無在海約規定外限制美國海軍自由行動之處、贊助海約參議員　思於昨日即促成票决、未能達其願望、乃天助人美、熱浪注行、使各參議員大有在華盛頓不能多居一日之勢、政府派利用此機、以全力使海約案於今晨速事解决、此案一了、特會可即日休會、專候十二月間召集短期會議、胡氏對海約案之簽字一層、當然可無滯留、當今晨特會開會對海約案進行辯論時、參議員魏格納氏曾駁海約之不當、謂該約對各强海備、並未做到實際上之縮減、又謂限制海備非美國之目的、而縮減實在所必要、今一班殷望海會能造到實地縮減海備者、無不大失所望、無乃縮減海備一層、在海會中並未列入議、程乎、雖然本人對追認海約則甚主張、因其聊勝於無也云、云、</p>
<p>又電投票反對海約之成立者、爲參議員萍漢等九人、參議員約翰遜氏曾提議一保留案、主張删除美國末一批三大巡洋艦建築之限制、此案經會衆以五十七票對七票否决、約翰氏另又提出一保留案、亦被打消、約翰氏見兩案不成、再提出一案、主張美國聲明若日後加入國際法庭時、則可將海約廢止、亦經由會衆以五十八票對八票推翻、此後尚有其他議員亦曾提出數保留案、但均未成立、至此參院即宣告休會、按此次海約之能急轉下、熱浪實爲功不淺、因當兹炎熱氣候、即反對派亦不願再行拖宕以自苦也、胡佛總統已照例接到參院通告海約案之通過、胡氏將各投票反對參議員名單、略一過目、並未發表任何意見、但於明日例行之新聞會議席上、胡氏對此案或有意見發表、</p>
<h3>日軍參會採納東鄕意見</h3>

<p>電通二十二日東京電　谷口軍令部長於參議官會議散會後、上午十一時四十八分、即赴華山行宫覲見日皇、奏請新國防計畫案諮詢軍事參議官會議、得其裁可退出、於是軍事參議官會議、决定明日在宫中開會、</p>
<p>電通二十二日東京電　樞府方面對倫敦條約諮詢之空氣、漸形硬化、近見非公式參議官會議之結果、於是空氣更形惡化、樞密院之一部、對參議官會議之經過、巳有表示見者、第一、帷幄機關之軍事參議官會議、旣言條約之兵力量、於國防有缺陷、補充又屬至難、則樞密院贊成條約之批准、自常識上觀、爲絕不可能之事、第二、縱令有補充之道、然視補充計畫之内容如何、如增加國民負擔、則與軍費節減之旨相背、不能簡單通過、</p>
<p>電通二十二日東京電　濱口首相接昨日軍事參議官會議形勢重大之報、即於午後九時召江木城相財部海相安達内相幣原外相等到首相官邸協議對策、先由財部海相報告渠在軍事參議官會議、被置於孤立無援之地、第二次會議不能不表明何等態度、並質問政府之意嚮、旋經愼重協議之結果、决定如參議官會議奉答文中、有國防缺陷難於補充等語時、政府决始終支持財部海相、雖財部海相表示辭意、决不使之辭職、即進行諮詢手續、於午後十一時過散會、形勢頓形惡化、該問題變爲政治問題、而益帶重大性、政府部内之狼狽與動摇、巳爲不可掩云、</p>
<p>電通二十二日東京電　軍事參議官會議、於政府方面爲最可憂慮之結果、巳見前電、海軍方面旣承認國防上確有缺陷、而反對之、財部海相爲條約簽字者、責任上當然辭職、故海相辭職爲時期問題、樞密院對海軍所反對之軍縮條約、不與批准、爲常識所能判斷、如是則政府之責任、當然成爲問題、或不得巳而總辭職、亦未可知、政界方面相形緊張、</p>

<h3>誌朱慶瀾將軍　志政</h3>
<p>僕僕道途。苦口勸賑之朱慶瀾將軍。字子喬。爲人廉直端方。有古俠士風。其生平軼事。頗多足紀。爰錄一二。藉以風世焉。</p>
<p>將軍有友。不幸中年而殁。臨終。以遺孤及妻子託朱。朱泣而諾之。代料量後事畢。即命友之子就學。友固貧。復時以金周濟其家庭。維時將軍處境亦殊窘。然將伯之助。未嘗或爽。比友子卒業於某校。以平日朱氏敎誨綦嚴。成績斐然。往見朱。欲獲一噉飯地。朱叱曰。予非可以私干者。若學成。好自爲之。即所以報爾父於地下也。未幾。友子仍困居。朱乃爲介紹至一小銀號。職位頗低。而工作則綦重。語人曰。少年每易涉浮誇。必磨勵而後可以成大器。聞者咸心韙之。</p>
<p>將軍昔年與張季直氏辦鹽墾於南通。自家至港。凡數十里。朱每行必徒步往。行李自携之。不假手於他人也。其子輩與偕行者。莫不深苦之。</p>
<p>此次陜災奇酷。將軍爰冒溽暑。親出勸募賑欵。代爲發散。人以將軍平日之廉直。多樂爲解囊。以是在哈爾濱埠一日。即得七萬元。其民胞物與之心。蓋亦天性使然也。</p>
<h3>猩猩血與毒氣砲之關係張炎</h3>
<p>摯友張效成君。前在吳佩孚處。任高級軍醫多年。吳失敗後。張君遂北走燕都。南游閩粤。迨游倦歸來。徜徉白下。結草廬於雨花臺之山麓。藉山水以怡情。極優游之能事。日昨與予相值。多年契闊。把酒言歡。惟其述及凡中砲火毒而昏迷者用猩猩血嗅之即醒一節。事屬創聞。爰誌之。藉供化學家一研究焉。</p>
<p>當民十三吳佩孚出兵喜峰口。與東北劇戰時。曾携去猩猩獮猴數吉。（按昔時報紙。曾記載此事。閱報諸君。或能憶及）惟世人祗知此種猩獮。係爲布電網。設地雷之用。其實爲避免砲毒之需。乃有此設備也。當吳與東北未决裂時。即向川滇諸省。購得猩猩獮猴數千。陸續運往陣地。對外人祗云輔助工兵。其實别有作用。蓋臨陣官兵。一嗅砲毒。無不立仆。後防者即殺猩獮。碗盛其血。塗暈仆者鼻際。立即蘇醒。聞最大之猩猩血。可救治四十人。獮猴雖小。亦能救治一二十人。張君曾參加戰役。且係親施救治者。斯言當不誣也。</p>
<h3>拉雜再度話蕪湖謙謙自蕪湖寄</h3>
<p>愚前曾以蕪事。拉雜告讀者。顧尚有未盡者。爰再記以續成之。</p>
<p>蕪湖之市政　蕪湖市政。近有一市政籌備處以計劃之。處長爲邵逸周君。腦筋頗新。對各種進行。尚稱努力。惟蕪湖街道之不平。眞有難以行走之嘆。蕪湖自備包車。亦如本刊數日前載志政兄「蘇游識小」中所云。有大喇叭及足鈴。嗚嗚之聲。時疑爲汽車。黄包車車整薄甚。乘之往來於不平之街道上。不能不常以兩手緊握扶手。尚時有東倒西歪之苦。愚每日自公署往返榷運局寓所。有時乘之。輒爲呌苦。而居民飮水以無自來水之故。輒仰給於江水。每日由挑夫挑送各家。然挑夫漫不經心。所過之處。水流遍地。尤其者。若長街之寺碼頭街。管驛巷等。終年濘濕。過之令人浩歎。實則市政處大可令挑夫各備桶蓋。挑時緊閉之。即可免此弊。而便利往來。這路不平。在於建築需欵。計劃需時。此等加一桶蓋。實爲輕而易舉之事。不知奮發有爲之邵處長。亦以愚見爲然否。</p>
<p>三存其一之電影院電影院。本有三處。厥名「蕪湖」。「國民」。「明星」。中外片雜映。地位布置。「蕪湖」較好。「國民」則假湖北會館之禮堂。但有銀幕而不用白布。爲其優點「明星」似稍次。放映機皆用新式兩連座。近則「國民」「明星」相繼暫停。其廣告書爲修理。實則尚有他種爲難之原因。近祇「蕪湖」一家開映。每日二時半八時一刻兩次。劵價最貴座爲五角。國産片之稍有情節者。即可滿座。歐美片祗滑稽及范朋克等享名較久之明星所主演者尚能號召。若最近負名之角色。則片雖佳妙。而上座殊寥寥耳。</p>

<h3>記女弟子樊頴初贈畫石予</h3>
<p>崇明樊女士秀。余友老畫師少雲之子。囊從余學詩。余字之曰穎初。畫筆深秀蒼潤。淵源家學。實爲松陸陸廉夫先生再傳弟子。蓋少雲自來吳門。曾親炙陸氏有年也。穎初頻年爲余畫扇。嘗語以異時積多。裝成扇册。按年編次。可較進步之度。穎初欣然意自得也。歲戊辰三月。余六十生辰。穎初畫立軸爲壽。屬以題句勿露壽意。恐裝裱時。爲吳門舊雨。曁門弟子輩所見。或以壽事嬲余也。穎初題五言一首云。乾坤萬刦塵。何自問剥復。亂世計苟全。蕭寥此耕讀。一丘一壑閒。幽居結林屋。旣合余意度。又與畫稱。余深喜之。今夏復贈余畫扇。題松壑鳴泉四字。氣脈深厚。大有吳中前輩顧若波先生意境。昔人有言。士别三日。即更刮目相待。余與穎初。不相見二年矣。宜其進步神速。有如是也。因爲詩報之曰。風雨湖山各一天。勞將畫篷　問衰年。盪胸爽氣連峰翠。到耳清音鳴壑泉。黄弲新辭同幼婦。紅閨舊學散羣仙。（余濫竽吳門振華女學校。皖贛閩粤湘鄂蜀諸省人士之流寓者。其閨秀多負笈來學。故余戊辰年詩。有二十年來人合老。紅閨弟子徧江南之句。）感君遠念丘園叟。一角溪林登几筵。曩嘗以陸渭南集授穎初。久不與談詩。今得其畫。意境絕俗。髣髴兼得其詩。畫中有詩。寗讓昔人獨步哉。</p>

<p>第十三回　是誰種福無意得鑛環惟此因緣有心歌金縷</p>
<p>那時左詩晨很覺得爲難。。又想回過頭去瞧他們。。又不好意思回過頭去瞧他們。。龍紫耘早瞧得出左詩晨有點局促的樣子。便道。。詩晨。。我給你掉一個坐位好嗎。。左詩晨連忙說道。。不要不要。。龍紫耘道。掉一個坐位。。大家便當些。省得你要回過頭去的費事。。又省得伊只顧看你的背後影。。左詩晨摇頭道。。掉不得坐位。。一掉坐位。。伊連望也不敢望一望。。只好一經和别人講話。。保不定要離開此地也難說咧。。左詩晨說那話時。。却見龍紫耘向對面看着。。說道。咦。眞個他們要去了嗎。。眞個要離開此地了嗎。。左詩晨也疾忙回顧頭去看。。原來單是蕊雲和一個十三四歲的小姑娘。。站了起來。只聽得蕊雲清脆的聲音。。說道。小小姐。。我們走走去。等放燄火還有一刻咧。。却見伊攙了那小姑娘的手。在草地上走去。這時候。。左詩晨看見了伊的全身了。只見伊穿了短短地一件鸚哥綠的熟羅單衫。。繫了高高地一條元色紡綢的裙子。。被晚風吹動了。。却有飄飄欲仙之象。。却見伊梳了一個近時所流行的墮馬髻。。還有似蟬翼一般的兩個後影。前額上的劉海髮。。幾乎遮到了肩心上頭。。髻上的黄蘭花。。正在散發那一種幽馨。。和伊胸口所掛的一個大苿莉花球。。爭奪那氤氲世界的權威。只見伊一手提着一個方方的軟銀絲的口袋。把口袋上的銀鍊條。繞在手背上。。一手却握着一柄白得比雪還要白的鷹毛扇。。那羽扇的正中。。有一個巍顫顫地碧綠的絨球。。和伊手臂上的一隻翡翠鐲兒。。一樣的從粉白中顯出綠來。。只見伊雪白的絲襪。。微露出弧形的腿部美。穿上一隻白外國緞繡墨金魚的平底鞋子。。左詩晨所奇異的。。一年以前。。在將出嫁的時候。伊還是一個小姑娘模樣。現在却儼然是一個少婦了。。身體站起來。。似乎比了以前。要高了半個頭兒。。便是面龐。。也比了從前。。豐腴了許多。。眞變了一個成年的人了。因又想到上個月含雲在檯面上碰到過一回。還轉了一個堂唱。。伊告訴我。。阿姐巳經生了一個小孩子了。。如此說來。伊已經做了母親了。我還以小姑娘的目光看伊。我還以從前蓬頭赤脚鄕下小女孩子的目光看伊。。這眞似於一個元首的貴人。。談起從前貧賤之交。。可謂一樣的不識時務了。。</p>

<h3>糧食　白粳米節節下游</h3>
<p>東新市仍平定</p>
<p>閘北　昨日河下到源見旺計二十餘號、走銷呆而少交、故此間存船已達七十號左右、常錫等貨北粳約跌半角之譜、特頂仍須二十一元、然此等米頗少、所有中關白粳則須短兩三角、次者則雖跌無人問津、市况之節節下游、斯乃大漲後之反動也、東新粳大盤甚平、仍開二十一元、現下廠棧機白粳己陸續出售、故船粳漸將受軋、總之白粳價格已無立足之望羊杜尖市勢步弱、到雖不旺、然因洋米之大跌、故亦急轉直下、全市祗白元站定、緣邇來通變有少數特銷、兼存到又稀、因此行情與前日相彷、</p>
<p>滬南　河下到船十號之譜、東新亦略見抵、本街走銷不暢、機粳續見修削、惟特頂帶平、餘如高貨普通等又短一兩角不一、南市在二十元關口之粳米、己極可觀矣、薄稻均隨粳市而行、去化不振、價與機粳相彷大盤計跌兩角左右、羊尖一落千丈、實因洋米跌風甚銳、查公會糙小絞米己祗開十元零、而一號西貢亦祇十七元關口、因此本秈狂瀉也變元高貨極少、中關銷塲平平、形勢亦覺帶軟新粳高貨仍開二十一元、惟此價恐不易站立耳、</p>
<h3>小絞糙慘跌後之狂漲</h3>
<p>一日間上落一元一角</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、上下午出入甚鉅、上午開市後、承前日之疲風、本客均主觀望而浮買心慌、求脫益亟、中次米尤欲　價急脫、小絞糙米自十元稍零跌至十元貨雖略次但比之前日竟小去一元半以上、乃爲洋米有市以來所未見者、大小絞白秈亦跟踪而下、市面幾有一瀉千里、漫無底止之象、慘落如此殊難意料、但各米跌小後、忽被杭州帮注目、除購買大小絞白秈外、尤注意於小絞糙、杭帮一辦、各客均爲跟買本街亦有過問、小絞糙驟漲至十二元一角、一日間竟有一元餘出入、共計開出六千餘包、大小絞亦有三五角上落、計開大絞三千餘包價十二元一角至十一元八角小絞三千包價十四元四角至十三元八角、一號西貢七百包、高十七元二角、普通十六元九角、均較前日最後售開者略形稳定云、</p>
<h3>粉市終難上進</h3>

<h3>白雪遺音續選李贊華</h3>
<p>在普通一般人心理、以爲只有喝了滿肚皮墨汗的文人、才能産生好的文學、其實、在我看來、覺得並不盡然、不管他是喝了幾多墨汁、文到怎樣程度、然而、在他的作品中却儘有不成其爲文學的東西、反轉來說、儘管有些人是怎樣地不文、偏偏他也會産生些好的文學作品來、所謂好的文學、並不是一味祗求詞藻的修飾和格調的工整、第一個條件、乃是我們先要看他是否從眞情至性中流露出來的、所以、我們從民間的歌曲裏、到發見了許多不文的民衆的好的文學、大抵他們因情之所至、不能巳於言時、乃放歌唱、於是、有些竟成爲絕妙好詞、流傳民間、便在文學上放了個光輝的異彩、威大利（ＶＩＣＴＡＬＥ）「在中國民歌裏、可以尋出一點眞的詩、···這些東西、雖然都是不懂文言的學的人所作、却有一種詩的規律、和歐洲各國相類似、···」這是我們應該相信的、</p>
<p>民間的歌曲旣是爲一般民衆因迫切的情感的衝動、而自然流露於口的、因之、他之所以偏於情歌方面、也自是必然的事、在中國的民間的情歌、當然要推詩經中的國風爲最早、鄭樵說、「風者、出於土風、大槪小夫賤隸婦人女子之言、其意雖遠、其言淺近重複、故謂之風」、朱熹更其說得直截了當、「風則閶巷風土男女情思之詩」、這兩種解釋、是很對的、詩經之所以有價值、也就是有這些眞情至性中流露出來的情思之詞的緣故、在詩經之後、本來也有許多民間的歌曲、但是、却無人去采集整理、任其散失絕傳、這是很可惜的事、至於近代的民間歌曲、更是不見有人重視、</p>
<p>到了近幾年來、才算得到了一部分人的注意、不過、仍不見有多在的成績罷了、</p>
<p>「白雪遺音」便是近代的民間情歌集、他之所以保存至今、使我們得有鑑賞的機會、這不能不感謝該書的搜集者廣華生、他生於清嘉慶年間、距今一百餘年、他在那時偏能獨具眼光與理解、費盡心血來搜羅這些民間的歌曲、眞是難得、我們看他說、「曲譜四本、乃多方搜羅、曠日持久、積少成多、費盡心血而後成者」、並且、據說他在卷首模仿馬頭調還做了一歌、首句是、「小小曲本是心愛」、末句是、「萬兩黄金也不賣」、這是何等的忠心於藝術的愛好、</p>
<p>現在、這本「白雪遺音」竟成了唯一的孤本了、我想、他是經過了多少的不幸、然而、總還算不幸中之大幸的、本書落在鄭振鐸先生手裏、得不致湮沒、但是、鄭先生却因爲原書猥褻的情歌沒有勇氣去印、於是、在幾年前、便只選出了其中的一部分付印、名爲「白雪遺音選」、並且在序裏說、「也許因爲原書中有些猥褻的情歌、被什麽官府禁止發賣或劈板之故、致此書現在絕不能得到、我們很有幸、乃能見到僅存的一部、「從這裏、我們可以看出民間情歌在封建制度舊禮敎勢力下是受怎樣的摧殘了、這本白雪遺音、幸而還有碩果僅存的海内孤本、我想、同時這類的情歌、怕是犧牲了不少罷、</p>
<p>「白雪遺音選」我是在鑑裳由看過的、但總以爲未能看見全書爲不足、現在隔了好幾年了、最近、無意商居然看到這本「白雪遺音續選」出世、　我覺得意外地欣喜、</p>
<p>「白雪遺續選」正　從「白雪遺音」中再選出二百零七首、而且、大膽地把鄭先生渹有勇氣去付印的猥褻的情歌都一古腦兒選了出來、</p>
<p>談起猥褻的情歌、總不外乎歌詠私情性交這類事情、在中國詠私情的詩、本來很多、如歐陽修的生查子、「月上柳梢頭、人約黄昏後、」都很普遍、而且、並不怎樣忌諱、可是、詠及性交的、郤大半含蓄藴藉、用象徵的字句來寄托如西廂記裏的酬簡「呀、劉阮到天台、春至人間花弄色、柳腰欵擺、花心輕折、露滴牡丹開、碧」玉詩中的、「碧玉破瓜時、相爲情顚倒感郎不羞郎、迴身就郎抱」像這一類的例子是很多、至於用「雲雨」二字來象徵、更是數見不鮮了、但是、却不見有大胆的描寫、</p>
<p>至於本書中的猥褻的情歌呢、「私情」的幾乎無一首不是關於必珠、他那狂熱的、火一般的描寫、却更是與衆不同、</p>
<p>有人說、情歌的猥褻乃是民間風化敗壞之證、但是、我却不敢輕於相信、我以爲猥褻的情歌的發生、正是由於男女相悅求自由的愛的動機、或是由於兩性關係的不滿而來的、雖然在衛道之士眼中看來、是應該諱莫如深的、但是、無如事實是如此、是不容你來壓制的、</p>
<p>本來、情歌的中心人物、大都是婦女、因之、我們在本書中、便更可以看出一般在舊禮敎勢力不渴望着愛的婦女是怎樣地挣扎、以及他們的心理、這裏有背叛丈夫偷漢子的女子、有閨中懷春大腹便便的少女、有朝朝莫暮的娼妓、有度着非人生活的尼姑、這些人都爲了愛、爲了愛幹出人家所不敢幹的事來、歌唱出人家所不敢唱的情歌來、現在、我們且把他在情歌中所表現的舉出例子來、像下面這首描寫背叛丈夫偷漢子的是何等膽大　　情人、不必你害怕、</p>
<p>有的是奴家、</p>
<p>外邊呌門原是俺家的他、</p>
<p>是個老忘八、</p>
<p>若害怕、悄悄藏在床底下、</p>
<p>要極好的方法、</p>
<p>等他來、自有開發他出去話、</p>
<p>先呌他把鍋刮、</p>
<p>打油、買鹽、稍帶着買茶、</p>
<p>還要把酒打、</p>
<p>呌情人、趁個空兒你偷跑了罷、</p>
<p>奴去把門揷、</p>
<p>撞見他、只說錯走把禮下、</p>
<p>不要得罪他、</p>
<p>像這樣的情歌、寫景叙情、面面俱到、又婉囀、又細膩眞實活潑一點毫沒雕飾的痕跡、是怎樣的動人、是怎樣地難得、而且、在社會上眞是無日沒有這樣的事情發生、她是如何忠實地放聲歌唱了出來、</p>
<p>其次、且看在舊禮敎勢力下偷情的閨中少女她是何等的恐慌、</p>
<p>自從那日相交後、</p>
<p>與你玩要受了點風凉、</p>
<p>小肚子不覺有些膨肪脹、</p>
<p>我的娘兒說我不像人模樣、</p>
<p>是病好還好</p>
<p>是胎兒難當、</p>
<p>我的俏寃家、</p>
<p>我這條小命兒活活坑在你身上、</p>
<p>我這條小命兒活活坑在你身上、</p>
<p>在舊禮敎的恐怖之下、少女偷情的</p>
<p>恐怖心理、這首表現得最爲深切、「我這條小命活活坑在你身上」、是多麽悲哀苦痛的呼喊、</p>
<p>上面所舉的例、是指普通的婦女、現在、我們來看所謂六根清净的尼姑是怎樣、</p>
<p>何曾有點尼姑用、</p>
<p>自己打量、</p>
<p>吃齋念佛、</p>
<p>又要燒香、</p>
<p>終是走慌忙、</p>
<p>响叮噹、鐘鼓振的俺魂飃蕩、　　　　　　眞是活遭殃、</p>
<p>拜佛前、神燈偏照俺醜模樣、</p>
<p>脚大頭皮光、</p>
<p>師傳面前少不得免强、</p>
<p>也緊裝腔、</p>
<p>眞乃是慾火燒身把心撞、</p>
<p>夜間守空房、</p>
<p>尋思起、淚珠兒點點滴滴在經本上、</p>
<p>濕過千萬行、</p>
<p>這把怪姑被慾火燒身的滿腔怨恨、煩惱、都表現得異常深刻、所謂「眞是活遭殃」、本來、歌詠尼姑的有「小小尼姑」「小尼姑」、「思凡」、「小小尼姑」三首「小小菴門」等七首、但我覺得描得悽惻動人還要算「小小菴門」這首、</p>
<p>小小菴門八字開、</p>
<p>尼姑堂前望夫來、</p>
<p>大殿改作相思閣、</p>
<p>鐘樓全作望夫臺、</p>
<p>去年當家悽六甲、</p>
<p>今年徒弟又種胎、</p>
<p>幸虧後面有塊三寳地、</p>
<p>不知埋了多少小嬰孩、</p>
<p>早早另投胎、</p>
<p>這是諷剌中充滿了血和涙、在那塊三寳地、不知殺害了多少嬰兒、是寫來何等動人、我們能不承認他的價值嗎、</p>
<p>我們再來看一看娼妓是如何地生活的、</p>
<p>清晨起來門前站、</p>
<p>身上無衣、</p>
<p>怨着天寒、</p>
<p>這幾天何曾見个嫖客面、</p>
<p>遇一人一把拉到勾蘭院、</p>
<p>不當你是調情、</p>
<p>只當你是可憐、</p>
<p>可憐我三天吃了一頓飯、」</p>
<p>呌爺們、一給我八个大錢吃碗麵、」</p>
<p>不過、有人說、這不過只是一个窮妓而巳、當然不能說是一般娼妓都如此、倘不嫌其長、那我再舉出一個例來、</p>
<p>我勸情人從良罷、</p>
<p>花街柳巷貪戀着甚麽、</p>
<p>細想想、</p>
<p>受了許多打合駡、</p>
<p>這幾年挣的銀錢、</p>
<p>何曾剩下、</p>
<p>人過三十如月退光華、</p>
<p>老了來改變容顔想我的話、</p>
<p>到那時要想從良無人嫁、</p>
<p>這把神女生涯原是夢的娼妓、總算描繪到入骨三分了、像那樣的窮妓、旣「娼」而且「窮」、自然更悽慘、但是、我們不是常見到這樣鬼形似的她們、在陰暗的馬路邊悽慘地活動嗎、</p>
<p>以上、把幾種描繪女性似乎都舉出來了、其他、還有極其滑稽有趣的、不妨舉他一首出來、</p>
<p>進得門來把手揑、</p>
<p>「我是個秀才、</p>
<p>你接也不接、</p>
<p>接了我、錦綉文章與你談風月、</p>
<p>講知心、</p>
<p>知疼、知冷、又知熱、</p>
<p>要甚麽情書立刻就寫、</p>
<p>要銀錢等我包攬着詞訟將你謝、</p>
<p>要銀錢等我包攬着槍手將你謝、」</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>佳人聽說抿嘴笑、</p>
<p>「旣是個秀才、</p>
<p>不該來嫖、</p>
<p>旣來嫖、或是銀來或是鈔、</p>
<p>風月中誰與你瞎胡閙、</p>
<p>講甚麽文章、</p>
<p>論甚麽道學、</p>
<p>奴不是御筆親筆親點的提學道、</p>
<p>奴不是御筆親筆親點的提學道、</p>
<p>這把一个酸滴滴的秀才寫得滴溜溜的在我們眼前轉、本來、在中國的滑稽歌曲裏、多半是詠怕老婆及大脚婆等、着首却别致得有趣、現在秀才的名號是沒有了、但是一般紅男綠女式的「要什麽情書立刻就寫」的新式秀才、怕也不會少了罷、</p>
<p>總之、我覺得這本民間的情歌是希有的好的文學、甚至於可以說、一切國風、子夜歌、讀曲歌等都及不止他、他的好處誠如郭紹虞先生所說、「因爲他不懂格式、所以不爲格式所拘泥、他又不要彫琢、所以不受彫琢的累墜、」章洪熙先生更說、「因爲他不懂道德、所以不爲道德所拘泥、他又沒有學問、所以沒有學問的累墜、」我還要替他加上兩句、「因爲他們勇敢、所以敢幹一般人所不敢幹的事、因爲他們大膽、所以敢歌唱一般人所不敢唱的眞情至性的戀歌」、</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>汽車工程協會之</h3>
<p>銀週歷史展志政</p>
<p>各項物品均屬名貴</p>
<p>宛如讀汽車進化史</p>
<p>轟動一時的汽車工程協會（Ｓ·Ａ·Ｅ·）銀週紀念。巳在印第安那閉幕了。在這次紀念會展覽中。尤其值得我們注意的。便是所謂「歷史展」。其中包羅很廣。凡是古代的汽車模型式樣。無一不搜集公開展覽。歷史展的會塲。在會議廳的下面。但是爲了東西太多的緣故。所以除印這廳而外。進門左右的玻璃房。也都作爲臨時展覽塲。我們最易看見的。是司密斯研究會的内燃引擎進化史。它把各種政会特准專利内燃機。從一八四四年直到現在。一一列陳着。並且有很詳細的說明。此外該會還有五只古化汽機。四只是從博物苑舊車中拆缷下來的。這些舊車。也有很悠久的歷史。而且總是第一輛。例如亞爾斯親手造的第一輛。也在其内、除缷四只以外。餘下來的一只是一九零一年達克造的。也可說是美國第一只化汽機。</p>
<p>在另一間房裏。是飛機進化史。這裏面尤其偉大了。因爲許多著名發明家如惠爾白。阿維爾。賴特等所造的引擎。遠在一九○三年前。也都陳列著。聽說這是經通用汽車公司借來的。還有一個引擎。是大發明家門賴氏手造的。其中所包含的。有許多地方和最近引擎相類似。它是五只汽缸冷氣機。可發出五十二匹馬力。每分鐘九五○轉。重一百十五磅。提起賴特（ＷＲＩＧＨＴＴ）差不多無人不知。他的引擎。是四缸式。附着一個飛輪。有三十至三十五四馬方。重一八○磅。派卡公司。也有最初發明的一只飛行提士引擎、是狐而生繪製的。也異常名貴。它試飛是一九二八年九月十九日。</p>
<p>下面走那裏。有美國歐戰統帥潘興將軍所製的軍用汽車。潘興將軍。是美國人最崇拜的。所以對於他的手製品。更是異常注目。接待寳裏懸着不少的照片。都是該會的前任會長。下層呢。第一是一九○二年皮來斯游車。還有許多印刷。都是汽車工業最初發達時代的廣告及共他宣傳品。福來橡皮公司。也把一八九八年來的進步情形、公開展覽。五光十色。煞是好看。又是一件歷史上名貴的事來了。就是最著名的９９９跑車。而由福特氏發明的。這輛跑車是第一輛汽車。打破每分鐘一里的紀錄的。還記得試騐的一九○四那天。福特氏在巴鐵摩亞海灣。親自駛着。結果是成了功。這輛車子。至今還由福特親自保藏着。這次歷史展。特地設法借來的。其次是一九○三年的福特Ａ式車。以及第千五百萬輛Ｔ式車。最有趣的。還是一輛漢斯門自動車。一九○二年造的。價錢是八百塊。現在看看。眞是要發笑。因爲它的設備。再簡陋沒有了。而且祗有兩只汽缸。除此而外。便是各廠家的第一輛出品。</p>
<p>我們看了這一次偉大的汽車歷史展。就不禁有些感想。什麽呢。便是看看自最初的機器到現在。不過二三十年的光景。然而每年有每年的進步。一天有一天改良。所以在短促的時期中。偏種下了許多燦爛的花果。科學家的偉大。自然十分可驚了。再次。我們看了許多由簡陋而入於精緻的引擎中。恍如讀了一部汽車進化史。至少可以令我們感覺得兩種意義。第一我們看了舊時代的出品。要知道他的偉大。不能笑他爲幼稚。因爲天下事以開端爲最難。接下來改良的便狠容易了。這是值得紀念的第一點。第二。我們知道了先輩的毅力進步。而又是在極短時期内的。那麽。自身也就要格外發奮努力。來學這般發明家。</p>
<p>歷史展是最後也是最精采的一幕。這裏面的東西。都極重珍貴。而多方設法蒐集來的。歷史展完了。銀色紀念會也閉幕了。還有這次汽車工程協會紀念會中。除却歷史展而外。還者其餘展覽。並且有重要工程討論。所議定的方案狠多。將來陸續發表。那時再報告讀者吧。（于交通大學）</p>

<h3>十六只汽缸新車問世</h3>
<p>市甘駕駛甚稱便捷</p>
<p>紐約消息。國民汽車展覽會舉行時。有一車廠以十六只汽缸之汽車。介紹於觀衆。當時引起汽車製造界中人之注意。遠過於預料所及。其初公衆對於此汽車。祇以爲陳列性質而巳。及至現在則深知。此種製造實係事實上成功。其能影響於蔣來多汽缸汽車製造之前途。蓋可斷言也。卡笛拉克摩托公司宣佈其Ｖ十六之汽車時。具有四種特色。爲公衆所注意。特色者即有力。耐用。舒適及易於駕駛是也。公衆於首次參觀此車時。對於前三項之特色。均加承認。但對於最後之易於駕駛一項。則未免有所懷疑焉。邇來此項新車已置之於普遍之宣傳。其最後一項之特色。吸引之力最大此車製造甚巨。行駛便捷車輪轉動。與機械内外呼應。凡曾經駕駛此車者。咸知其輕靈便捷也。</p>
<p>卡笛拉克Ｖ十六之引擎。爲汽門在頭式者。有固著之平均性。其排動量爲四百五十二立方英寸。馬力在一百七十五匹之譜。此項汽車引擎之集中力。生於駕駛之力者。可自下列字典中。馬力之注解想像之。馬力者「工率之標準單位。等於三三·○○○磅。一分鐘中舉一尺之高。」照上述之根據計算。此Ｖ十六之引擎大約於一日無限之時間中。可舉十六噸一百七十五尺之一、四四零次。以此種集中之力量。使就範於管理之中。若干年之研究工作必不可少。以担保其所有之結果。此中之最可稱述者。厥爲駕駛時之平稳。無論速率高低。或路面粗劣。均不受影響也。此種汽車雖於高速哩程中。能自行滑動此種特質常與機力相混合。其增加速率之巨。較之快速之進行爲大。此車製造之時對於舒適一端注意甚多。關於此項之注意。不僅就坐位之校正。内部之精巧而言。即於駛行時之動作亦分外注意。如此巨大之汽車。其於重力之校正一項最感困難。然此車則於此點業經解决。凡行長距離之行程。殊不覺得路疲也。至於滑動動作之稳平則令車主有减短行程之感想焉。十六只汽缸同時工作時。並無若何之聲息。因引擎之内用自動之減音器。俾活塞動作時無震耳之感也。</p>
<p>齒輪桿槓之適應性。易常靈便。欲高欲低。祇一舉手之勞耳。此蓋由於無衝突之調節傳遞式也。克勒子之動作亦然。輩視之雖甚巨大。然駕駛之時。輕便靈動。殊可奇異。其舵輪駕駛之便捷亦予有力焉。車輪之動作完全不藉小滑輪用輕微之壓力爲之導引。此Ｖ十六式之汽車。實爲公衆所視。其特色則爲汽車製造界前此所未有。將有不同凡響之結果可斷言也。</p>
<h3>發展中國内地須從道路着手吉</h3>
<p>歐化東行以來。我國門戸洞開。素稱神秘偉大之帝國。遂爲萬國貿易之市場。近數十年中。時勢變遷。環境大。改素不相往來之縣鄕。毫無關係之鄰國。因海陸交通之發展與舟車之便利。彼此接近。互相交易。至今二十世紀。中外之關係。因愈益親近。我國之趨勢。亦隨新潮流而更動。内地邊省。大興工程。紛紛造路。利用汽車以便交通。加以中國道路協會之急極工作。改良内地之路政。促進全國之覺悟。成績之優著者。最爲吾人所稱道。今年爲該會之十週紀念。據最近報告。我國現有道路巳達二萬六千六百六十六哩。幾貫全國各省。足敷運輸之用。近雖兵燹連年。然人民對於築路計劃。不遺餘力。當局對於建路工作。續繼進行。</p>
<p>南昌古郡。江西省之都會也。地距上海九百餘哩。鞏守古風。二年前。尚無整潔之道路。汽車視爲奇物。然近來進步神速。澈底改革。現正急極興築道路。便利商務交通。今昔之南昌。確有天壞之别。城内大道。四面貫通。客貨汽車往來不絕。市面熱閙。商業振興。全城巳煥然一新。近來更圖發展城外之汽車事業。擴充汽車道路。通達毘鄰城鄕。促進交通商務。今在服務之汽車。巳有七十餘輛。載貨連客</p>

<p>。功用頗大也。</p>
<p>江西之南昌。可爲全國築路之模範。呈近宣佈計劃開闢之五大新路。擬連貫　内各大城市。並通達上海南京蘇州等要埠。刻正在急極進行中預計其建築費須六百萬元左右。</p>
<p>華南之遠路建設亦有同樣之計劃。自一九二二年孫總理建都於廣東時。提倡築路。不遺餘力。當時所造成之公路。已有八千餘哩。便利交通。啓發商務。改良市政。迎合民心。因之南政府内政鞏固。外侮無慮。得以造成今是國民政府。築路之方針。莫大之功焉。</p>
<p>一九二九年廣西省政府之財政開支。大部分用於建築道路。計在三百萬元以上。今年之預算尤高。五年前之南寗。尚爲一腐舊之省會。今道路建築後。别開生面。成爲省道之中心點。貫通全省各大城市。今日之南寗。巳爲廣西之命脈。其道路之優美。發展之敏捷。不弱於他省。致其促進路政之急極。可據南寗稅務司之報告。以見一般。</p>
<p>據云南寗之築路計劃。均有專門工程師指導。故其成績較著。道路堅實。哩數遠長。故今汽車可以穿山過嶺。深入内地。行駛數百哩。無所阻難。迅便異常。現更計劃另築新經。貫通全省遠區。並擬開闢支幹。直達河岸海口之地云。</p>
<p>貴州遠在邊境。向與他隔絕。而其道路建設。不謂急進。去春農戸市民五萬餘人。趕工築路。北自貴陽。修築幹綫。西至安山。計六十餘哩。工程頗大。然人民工資極微。所得僅足以糊口。至於一切建築路費。均由各區分擔公認。</p>
<p>該路平直無比。工作精良。路線經過。並不損壞稻田。路基二百餘哩。均在耘耕前或收割後舖設。不碍農戸工作。去秋九月間當局又擬添傭十萬工人。鑿溝開渠。加工建築。擬完成二百哩之幹線。最近所得報告。謂巳傭工十五萬名。開始建築。約在二月間可以造至桐梓。地距貴陽百五十哩。</p>
<p>事在人爲。今年三月。巳將頭等道路數哩完成。路在城外。全用碎石舖成。汽車行駛其上。可以開足速度。平稳異常。</p>
<p>内地交通阻滯不便。邊省尤感困苦。汽車運往貴省。自廣東用駁船與本排轉運。經山徑溪壑時。更賴人力爲之。背載肩挑。拔涉深水。約行五十日之路程。始抵目的地。其運輸之困難與交通之不便。决非上悔北平或紐約倫敦人士所能意想也。</p>
<p>此乃二年前之貴州。今則情形大改。在此二年中。進步甚速。道路加添。車輛增多。今全省道路共有二千五百哩。客貨車與長途車亦有八十七輛。其中大都爲通用汽車。據貴州道路建設會之計劃。在最近二三年内。恢此改良。進步必更奇著。車輛必定加倍。</p>
<h3>飛利特烏特車身廠</h3>
<p>李吉人</p>
<p>規模全球最大</p>
<p>車身種類最多</p>
<p>今之汽車事業。發展新奇。成績優著。各廠所有出品。無不希　大宗。實行專一。故今歐美各國之工藝。皆有專技。即如汽車工業言之。製造一車。手續甚繁。須經幾個廠家。互相供給。始能成器。如車廠專製機身底盤。車身另有專廠承造。各專一門。以精其業。</p>
<p>大都車身製造專家向爲富麗馬車與時式轎之建築者。自汽車發明以後。因利益之關係與潮流之趨勢。均改爲製造汽車。車身之專家。同業中最著者。爲飛利特烏特車身廠。承造全球名貴汽車之車身。如卡笛拉克。派克。林肯等。無論多少定貨均能如數代造。其營業範圍之廣與車身種類之多。無與倫比。</p>
<p>飛利特烏特車身廠最初設於本薛佛及亞森林中。似無若何發展希望。中憶。天公佑人。該地之森林。性質堅實。製物適用。因之遂得各汽車廠家之重視信仰。營業日增。銷路發旺。而成供不敷求之勢。</p>
<p>第屈萊（ＤＥＴＲＯＩＴ）城爲其新廠之地址。地點設中。商務要城。各大工廠均集中於此。美國通用汽車製造總廠所出卡笛拉克與拉薩爾之車身。即由飛科特烏特廠承造也。</p>
<p>美國爱用汽車製造總廠鑒於飛利特烏特車身廠進步之神速與製法之稍微。决計有與其合組之必要。庶使卡卡迪拉克汽車廠有源源接濟之準備與標準品之保障。</p>
<p>飛利特烏特車身廠之有今日。自弱小之作塲以至世界最偉大之車身廠。全賴廠主施記勃勒氏一人之主力。第屈新廠之面積。共計一百五十萬方呎。價值五百萬美金。據施氏稱。裝置飛利特烏特車身之底盤。銷路暢旺。反成工作上之二大問題。一爲廠塲不敷應用。一爲精敏技師缺乏。現新舊二廠。正在從事擴充。急極敎練。二者當不成何問題。</p>
<p>優美之汽車。式樣製法與顔色。均有一定之標準。車身建築者。必須有熟手爲之。專造一種車身。如是手藝特緻。工作精良。所有製物。獨出心才。與衆不同。</p>
<p>卡笛拉克汽車廠之出品。素以準確優美著。飛利特烏特所造之車身。亦以精緻堅固名。二廠工作均極認眞。手藝異常細巧。故其出品之美。是不待言矣。</p>
<p>一九二九年間。卡笛拉克汽車廠向飛利特烏特車身廠所定之車身。價在一百萬美金以上。所有定造車身。均係裝於卡笛拉克與拉薩爾底盤之用者。</p>
<h3>南華道路之今昔觀美烈</h3>
<p>破壞易。建設難。宇宙間一切物質之毁滅創興。莫不在此公例中。况乎國家之根本事業。其締造之艱難。自無待論。我國頻年多故。民生凋敝。破壞屢經而建設鮮見。獨於交通之啓發。路政之設施。則頗具有相當成績。此不僅國人稍足引以自慰。即外邦人士亦常從而贊譽之也。近頃全國道路協會舉行十週紀念時。對於全國道路有詳密統計報告。而於南方各省之路政現狀。尤有詳明之觀察。兹聞該會職員某君述及。特記其大要如下。</p>
<p>江西統計全國道路。現在巳達八萬四千七百餘里之長。適合摩托運輸之用。汽車轍痕巳可普現於内地各省。現在雖當地方多事之秋。而路工之進展固仍繼續未巳。今先就贛省言之。當兩年前。南昌省會尚是完全舊式郡城。小道狹巷。雜亂錯綜。無所謂道路。而「汽車」之一名稱。更爲多數人民所不知。今則一變而爲商賈輻輳之新都市。寛衢坦道。四通八達。古代恃以防禦之城垣。亦巳拆除。改築道路。註册汽車共有七十餘輛之多。至於南昌以外之道路。亦極形發達。凡得要大城。現均築有石子大道與省會聯絡。長途汽車與貨車往來甚暢。現因謀聯絡各大城邑起見。尚有五大幹路之計劃。預算費需銀六百萬元。</p>
<p>廣東　廣東爲革命之發祥地。凡事俱得風氣之先。道路建設之銳進。實爲各省冠。自民國十一年迄今。所築之路巳逾七千里。長途汽車綫因此目益繁密。汽車行及服務站遍及全省。宛如星羅棋布。亦可見其趨勢之盛矣。</p>
<p>廣西民國十八年度之廣西省財政决算書。其支出項下。以築路經費一項爲最多。約近三百萬銀元。於以見桂省路政之所以突飛猛進。而本年度之路費預算。復更增多。財力旣裕。成功自偉。近就省會南寗而言。五年前尚係一偏僻之舊城。至於今日。巳成爲綰轂各大小城邑間路綫之中心點矣。自南寗乘汽車不數里。陟過山岡後。即入通各縣之大道。所有路綫。悉照新式工程建築。頗合實用。現在計畫中者。尤有多條。以謀聯絡遠近各部。而得通達省外之出路。</p>
<p>貴州　貴州在兩年前路政尚未發軔。比歲則進行甚力。去春曾以五萬農民。役於貴陽迤北及西至安順間之築路工作。所耗工資。均甚低微。其數足敷工人伙食之需而略有餘。由路綫所經區域供給之。辦法至爲公允。所選路線。尚屬平直。圾度亦不陡峻。自安順經貴陽六百餘里之路基。已多半在播榖前塡築。當農忙期間。則暫時停止。迨收穫後始繼續進行。其時當局爲求速效起見。擬以十萬人工從事。俾將路基工作及涵洞建築完成。以期次年春汽車可以通行於此六百里之路線。泊乎今春已有十五萬工役努力於此。以便達到二月間通車至桐梓（距貴陽約四百五十里）之目的。果也有志事易成。至三月初間。貴陽城外巳完成十餘里之上等良好道路。汽車開足速率。可以暢行無阻矣。其第一部汽車。係運自粤省。由民船及人力輾轉搬運。經五旬始達。此種艱難運輸之情形。殆非住於平津滬之一般人士所能想像。雖然。此固爲兩載前之狀况。而在此兩年中。因政府與人民合作努力之結果。其道路之里數。與夫汽車之量數。均有顯著之增進。最初僅有汽車一輛。今巳增爲八十七輛矣。道路之里程。今亦將進而至二千五百里矣。華路藍縷。成績至佳。最近貴州公路局且擬定擴充計畫。今後兩三年内道路之進展。可望倍於此數。足見黔省之路政。方興未艾也。</p>
<h3>汽車保險林英楣</h3>
<p>近來在保險事業中新添了一種所謂汽車保險。這也是因時代之須要才發生的。這種汽車保險在歐美各國裏不但早已通行。並且認爲近世必不可少的一種事業。我國各種事業都比他人落後幼稚。汽車運輸更不及英美各國之萬一。所以這種汽車保險的名詞在我國還是很新的。可是上海一隅。因地理上的關係。爲中外貿易之樞紐。故有牠特殊的發展。且租界當局。經營市政。不遺餘力。建築平坦寛闊之馬路。以供高速度車輛之馳驅。甚至不惜破壞國際條約。越界築路。因此汽車數量之增加。大有一日千里之勢。根據公共租界一九三○年月底之統計。在租界内登記領照之公私汽車。公共汽車。載貨汽車等合計不下六。九九五輛之多。所以上海之汽車保險事業。也就應運而生了。經營此業者均係外商。多就原有之保險事業中增設一門。以發展營業。其中以保隆保險公司爲最起勁。兹將該公司之汽車保險章程逐條譯錄於后。</p>
<p>（一）車身。車燈。輪胎及其他附件。因下列各種原因。而受損失損壞時</p>
<p>（Ａ）因偶然失愼以致互撞或傾覆。或因機器損壞及年久耗損。以致互撞或傾覆。　　（Ｂ）失火。外部爆烈。自然焚燒。觸電。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）失竊。被盜。</p>

<h3>汽車大王談屑　黄影呆</h3>
<p>舉行結婚紀念　我人回憶四十二年之前。地屈勞哀有威廉姆福特特其人者。乃子亨利福特。即今日美國之汽車大王也。與一農家之女。舉行婚禮。福特之妻。即畢蘭德女士。ＭＩＳＳ　ＣＬＡＲＡＢＲＹＡＮＴ也、在地屈勞哀郊外。草地之上。彼等夫婦二人。在結婚之前。共同盟誓焉。結婚之日。由克林斐德聖保羅堂敎士。爲之宣誓。時福特則二十五歲。而其妻則二十一歲也。本年四月十一日。福特夫婦。在地屈勞哀舉行婚後四十二周紀念。且是日又爲福特夫人之誕辰也。舉凡美國各地。汽車界人。以及軍政要人。莫不至地屈勞哀向福特夫婦致賀。種種熱鬧情形。亦不言而喻矣。福特夫婦。此次舉行紀念之地。則在斐亞萊恩地方當時夫婦二人。在該處僅有農田少許。而今則有千百畝矣。如此福特夫婦之婚姻而言。則福特第一次見畢蘭德之時。在克林斐德某跳舞塲。經人之介紹。彼此相識焉。福特一見之下。即傾心於畢蘭德。而愛芽情苗。遂由此發生矣。當是時也。福特雖有意於畢蘭德。而畢蘭德則並未注意福特也。相隔一年之久。及第二次跳舞時。彼此又唔面焉。二人始談欵曲。於是畢蘭德回家後。即告於雙親。謂福特乃異於尋常之少年。面貌之漂亮。性情之和靄。均爲他人所不及。而第二次跳舞之時。福特對之。尤覺注意也。自此以後。草地之上。時見二人携手同行。喁喁私語。相隔二年之後。待福特之父。以農田若干。分於福特。福特始與畢蘭德婚焉。福特自結婚後。辛苦經營。後又從事於汽車事業。而今日巳成汽車大王。其間得夫人内助之力。亦屬不少。故福特夫婦。迄今仍受情融洽。和好如初也。</p>

<h3>Decision to Postpone the Office of Plenipotentiary Representative for the Sino-Soviet Conference</h3>
<p>(Nanjing Dispatch) The Office of the Plenipotentiary Representative for the Sino-Soviet Conference, which was previously approved to be temporarily established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was originally limited to three months, with a budget ending at the end of July. Recently, according to a telegram from Mo Dehui, there is no confirmed date for the opening of the Sino-Soviet Conference, and it seems difficult to complete the matter in the near future. It is proposed to request an additional budget. The ministry believes that although Mo and others have already gone to Russia, the official meeting has not been confirmed with a date, and it will not be possible to complete it in a short time. It seems that the request for an additional budget should be approved for an extension to facilitate the conference affairs. After being forwarded to the Executive Yuan for review, it has recently been ordered to approve the extension for three months. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

Our country must first pay the British side before it can be returned. On the evening of the 22nd, someone inquired about the Ministry of Foreign Affairs whether the British side had the intention of delaying, and Wang replied that it was probably not the case.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Reaction Against Resistance</h3>
<p>During the European War, powerful nations needed resources from weaker nations. Therefore, after the European War, the spirit of resistance among the weaker nations against the powerful nations greatly flourished. At that time, the original strength of the powerful nations had not yet recovered, and the trend of the times forced them to be tolerant and perfunctory. However, as of today, the trend of resistance has gradually given rise to a reaction. What is this reaction? It is the attempt to eliminate resistance through the means of strong suppression.</p>
<p>If one were to say that this is not the case, then consider India, Egypt, Annam, Korea, Finland, the Steel Helmet League in Germany, and the Fascist Party in Italy in recent times. Their meaning and the direction of their actions are evident. It is because their emphasis on strength and the heart for peace have long since shifted. The ancients have said, "Everything in the world is without smoothness or slopes, without going and returning." The reaction against the tide is a common and not an unusual event. However, the reason why there is a reaction to the tide is that the previous tide had already been unhindered, sweeping through a period of time and going too far. Only then will a new tide arise to resist it. The change of the world is promoted by this rise and fall. If the previous tide has not yet shown a clear and great effect, and the subsequent reactive tide arises immediately, then the reaction against the reaction in the future will inevitably be even more intense. It is because the formation of a tide in the world is by no means a coincidence. If its energy has not yet been expressed and one attempts to suppress it, it is feared that it will not be possible.</p>

<h3>US Special Committee Approves London Naval Treaty</h3>
<p>Heatwave Helps Make it Happen</p>
<p>Secret Documents Case Temporarily Reserved</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 21st: The US Senate Special Committee ratified the London Naval Limitation Treaty by a vote of 58 to 9. Senator Norris's proposed amendment regarding the retention of secret documents was also passed as an attachment. Although government representatives had long predicted that the treaty would be voted on today, the large number of affirmative votes was a pleasant surprise. Today, everyone is overjoyed, saying that this shows that President Hoover's foreign policy is popular. The Norris reservation is not regarded as a flaw in this victory, as it is only to prevent the Senate from being bound by secret documents outside the express provisions of the treaty. Previously, the government party strongly advocated for the unconditional passage of the treaty, while the opposition put forward eleven reservations to obstruct its passage. The Norris reservation proposal is a compromise to reconcile the opinions of both sides. President Hoover also stated that all secret documents do not restrict the freedom of action of the US Navy outside the provisions of the treaty. Senators supporting the treaty tried to push for a vote yesterday but failed to achieve their wish. Heaven helps those who help themselves. The heatwave made it impossible for the senators to stay in Washington any longer. The government party took advantage of this opportunity to use all its strength to quickly resolve the treaty this morning. Once this case is closed, the Special Committee can adjourn immediately and wait for a short meeting to be convened in December. Of course, there will be no delay in President Hoover's signing of the treaty. When the Special Committee opened this morning to debate the treaty, Senator Wagner refuted the treaty, saying that the treaty did not achieve a real reduction in naval armaments for the great powers. He also said that limiting naval armaments is not the goal of the United States, but a real reduction is necessary. Now, those who earnestly hope that the naval conference can achieve a practical reduction in naval armaments are greatly disappointed. Is it not that the reduction of naval armaments was not included in the agenda of the naval conference? However, I strongly advocate for the ratification of the treaty, because it is better than nothing.</p>
<p>Another dispatch states that the senators who voted against the establishment of the treaty were Senators Bingham and eight others. Senator Johnson proposed a reservation to remove the restriction on the construction of the last batch of three large US cruisers. This case was rejected by the assembly by a vote of 57 to 7. Johnson also proposed another reservation, which was also rejected. Seeing that the two cases were unsuccessful, Johnson proposed another case, arguing that the United States should declare that if it joins the International Court of Justice in the future, the treaty can be abolished. It was also overturned by the assembly by a vote of 58 to 8. After that, other senators also proposed several reservations, but none of them were established. At this point, the Senate announced its adjournment. The heatwave was a great contributor to the rapid conclusion of this treaty, because in this hot weather, even the opposition was unwilling to delay any longer to suffer. President Hoover has received the Senate's notice of the passage of the treaty as usual. Mr. Hoover glanced over the list of senators who voted against it and did not express any opinions, but he may express his opinions on this case at tomorrow's routine press conference.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Conference Adopts Togo's Opinion</h3>
<p>National Defense Deficiencies Difficult to Supplement</p>
<p>Minister of the Navy Isolated and Helpless</p>
<p>Government Greatly Embarrassed</p>
<p>Formal Meeting Convened Today</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: Today's unofficial military councilors meeting continued at 8 AM this morning. First, Minister of Military Affairs Taniguchi presented the same consultation proposal and reply draft from the previous day for discussion. The desperate efforts of Navy Minister Zaibu were ultimately rejected. The atmosphere of the meeting became more hardened. It was finally decided to adopt Marshal Togo's proposal, which is, "The national defense deficiencies arising from the conclusion of the treaty are extremely difficult to supplement with forces outside the restrictions." The meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: After the military councilors meeting adjourned, Minister of Military Affairs Taniguchi went to the Huashan Palace at 11:48 AM to meet the Emperor and request that the military councilors meeting be consulted on the new national defense plan. He received approval and withdrew. Therefore, the military councilors meeting decided to hold a meeting in the palace tomorrow.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: The atmosphere in the Privy Council regarding the consultation on the London Treaty is gradually hardening. Seeing the results of the unofficial military councilors meeting recently, the atmosphere has deteriorated further. A part of the Privy Council has expressed its views on the proceedings of the councilors meeting. First, the military councilors meeting of the inner circle has already stated that the treaty's military strength has deficiencies in national defense, and supplementation is extremely difficult. Therefore, it is impossible for the Privy Council to approve the treaty, from a common-sense point of view. Second, even if there is a way to supplement, depending on the content of the supplementation plan, such as increasing the burden on the people, it would run counter to the purpose of reducing military spending and cannot be simply passed.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: Upon receiving the report of the serious situation of yesterday's military councilors meeting, Prime Minister Hamaguchi summoned Minister of the Interior Emaki, Minister of the Navy Zaibu, Minister of the Interior Adachi, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Shidehara to the Prime Minister's official residence at 9 PM to discuss countermeasures. First, Minister of the Navy Zaibu reported that he was placed in an isolated and helpless position at the military councilors meeting, and that he had to express some kind of attitude at the second meeting, and questioned the government's intentions. After careful deliberation, it was decided that if the councilors meeting's reply stated that national defense deficiencies were difficult to supplement, the government would support Minister of the Navy Zaibu to the end, and even if Minister of the Navy Zaibu expressed his intention to resign, he would not be allowed to resign, and consultation procedures would proceed. The meeting adjourned after 11 PM, and the situation suddenly deteriorated. The issue has become a political issue and is becoming increasingly important. The government's internal embarrassment and shaking have become undeniable.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: The most worrying result for the government of the military councilors meeting has already been seen in the previous telegram. Since the navy has admitted that there are indeed deficiencies in national defense, it opposes it. Minister of the Navy Zaibu is the signatory of the treaty, and he is naturally responsible and will resign. Therefore, the Minister of the Navy's resignation is a matter of time. It is common sense to judge that the Privy Council will not approve the military reduction treaty opposed by the Navy. If so, the government's responsibility will naturally become an issue, or it may be forced to resign en masse, which is unknown. The political world is increasingly tense.</p>
<h3>Indian Muslim Conference Dissatisfied with Simon Report</h3>
<p>Considered Conservative and Regressive</p>
<p>All Three Major British Parties to Participate in Round Table Conference Reuters, Lucknow, 22nd: Sir Sapru and Mr. Jayakar plan to visit Gandhi and the Nehru father and son in prison to persuade them to restore peace. According to speeches by Malaviya and Beitail at the citizens' assembly here, if this trip does not store evidence of independence in the pocket instead of empty talk, it may be fruitless. Muslim representatives held the largest meeting here today and passed a resolution stating that Simon's report is regressive and conservative. If Britain proposes an honorable solution based on the status of a fully self-governing dominion, it should be negotiated, and Muslims should be encouraged to join the Gandhi movement. Reuters, London, 21st: The authorities have now decided that the Labour Party, the Conservative Party, and the Liberal Party will all participate in the British delegation</p>

<p>attending the Round Table Conference on the future of India.</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 21st: Governor-General Irwin has collected the opinions of Indian princes and some members of the Legislative Council on the Simon Report. Today, he will consult with the secretaries of the provincial governors. According to the opinions of responsible Indian figures, the London Round Table Conference must put forward proposals. The overall situation in India is not optimistic, especially in Bombay. The situation in the province is very tense, businesses are closing one after another, and many people are unemployed, which may lead to an economic crisis affecting the entire Indian commerce.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st: The Indian government's report on Indian affairs for the week ending July 19 stated that the situation in the Northwest Frontier Province and other places has eased, but the inevitable influence of the non-violent resistance movement, that is, the spirit of disregard for the law, has now become increasingly serious. This is not directly related to the resistance movement, but criminal cases in various provinces have indeed increased. The Governor-General's speech to the two houses on the 9th has had an effect among the moderate factions in India. Now, moderate elements are gradually advocating abandoning unconstitutional methods.</p>
<h3>Serious Situation in Egypt</h3>
<p>Crowds Demonstrate Near Parliament</p>
<p>Military Deployed as if Facing a Great Enemy</p>
<p>National News Agency, Cairo, 21st: A major riot occurred here today. 320 people were arrested and 87 were reportedly injured, most of whom were seriously injured. Many of those with minor injuries did not go to the hospital, so it is impossible to count them. There is no confirmed number of deaths. According to the latest statistics, it exceeds 20. The authorities are now lifting the suspension bridge over the Nile River to prevent people from other places from coming to the capital to join the demonstration movement. Members of Parliament have petitioned the King of Egypt to convene a special meeting on the 26th of this month. The situation is extremely serious. Although the parliamentary delegation committee tried to avoid bloodshed today and strongly advocated canceling the original proposal to rush into Parliament, demonstrators clashed with the police from early morning, and it continued from time to time until late at night. Although the authorities announced special martial law, cut off traffic at night, and prohibited gatherings of more than five people, it is feared that riots will still be difficult to avoid at night. This riot started with a clash between people and police near the Ministry of Interior, and the chaos spread like wildfire. Troops and tanks were successively sent to the main roads to suppress the demonstrators, and defensive obstacles were built near the Abidin Palace, and they tried to ignite the gas leaking from the street lights. When the troops wanted to rush in, the crowd threw stones without stopping, which led to the opening of fire. In addition, there were also incidents of firing by police in various places. The conflict near the Parliament was the most intense. The immunity enjoyed by members of Parliament has been temporarily canceled by order of the King, and the parliamentary guards have also been disbanded in the morning. The entire city is heavily guarded, like a large barracks. Commerce is completely suspended. Only British troops are still stationed in the camp, and only Egyptian troops are sent to defend, commanded by British officers. In addition, demonstrators in Port Said today tried to rush into foreign residential areas and were stopped by police fire, killing two and injuring 21. 75 soldiers and police officers were also injured.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 21st: Former Egyptian Finance Minister Makram today denounced Egypt's suppression of democracy in the Parliamentary Association, declaring that the unrest in Egypt is due to Egyptians defending their constitutional freedoms against the autocratic government.</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Accepts Amendment to Coal Mine Bill</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st: The British Coal Mine Bill stipulates 7.5 hours of underground work per day. The House of Lords amended it a few days ago to allow 90 hours of work every half month. Working hours are calculated on a half-monthly basis instead of a daily basis. This case seemed to be shelved. However, today the House of Commons unanimously decided to accept this amendment, but slightly changed the wording, stipulating that contracts in each coal area regarding the distribution of working hours must have the consent of both mine owners and miners. This case is now sent back to the House of Lords for reconsideration.</p>

<h3>Sino-Russian Conference Holds Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>Scope Also Expanded, Prioritizing CER Problem</p>
<p>Harbin Communication, 16th: After many days of silence, there is recent talk of continuing negotiations for the Sino-Russian Conference. However, as the meeting place is in Moscow, the truth is difficult to determine. Today, the diplomatic messenger Chuan Zhanwen, who accompanied Mo Dehui to Russia, returned from Moscow at 8 AM with the order to carry important documents. The reporter met with him at the Governor's Office and asked about the conference situation he witnessed before leaving Russia. According to him, "I left Moscow on June 29 and returned to China. At that time, the Sino-Russian delegation was holding a preparatory meeting at the Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Committee office. In addition to the Chinese plenipotentiary Mo, all the special commissioners under the Russian plenipotentiary Karakhan were present to discuss. When the delegation set off for Russia, it was expected to stay in Russia for two or three months and the meeting would be completed. When the preparatory meeting began and various issues were actually discussed, it was realized that it could not be completed in a short period of time. Moreover, the Soviet Union convened the 16th Communist Party Congress, and important Russian figures were busy participating in the meeting and preparing proposal materials. Therefore, the Sino-Russian negotiations have been delayed until now. The date of the delegation's return to China is still difficult to predict at this moment. At least it must be determined after the official meeting opens. Plenipotentiary Mo and the commissioners have not left Moscow. They are all living in the Hotel Metropol. The members of the Russian delegation are living in the Grand Hotel. The Chinese delegation only occasionally visited various factories and exhibitions, or went to the theater in the evening. They have not interrupted the preparation for the meeting at all. Soviet factories are all busy manufacturing and have a promising future. The rumors that Plenipotentiary Mo went to Berlin and the reports that important documents were lost are completely untrue. As for Commissioner Liu Zerong's temporary arrest, it was due to a misunderstanding, and he was released after the explanation, etc." After arriving in Harbin, he went to visit Li Shaogeng, acting president of the CER, and other important figures, and delivered documents. It will take about a week or so before he returns to Moscow. It is said that the official meeting of the two sides has been scheduled to open on August 1. The scope of the meeting has been slightly expanded compared to before. Issues concerning trade agreements, navigation rights, and the right to station consuls in the Northeast will all be raised for resolution. However, before discussing various items, the precondition is still to resolve the CER issue first. The central government and the Northeast have the same opinion on this matter. Recently, Mo Dehui was instructed to do so. Therefore, the Sino-Russian Conference, which had been deadlocked for more than a month, has recently turned a corner.</p>
<h3>Xiang and Guangdong Armies Encircling Northern Guangxi</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Regarding Guangxi's military situation, after Li Zongren, Huang Shaoxiong, and their respective units retreated into Guangxi, they are currently reorganizing and replenishing in Guilin. Meanwhile, Huang Xuchu's unit has moved towards Pingle, Han Caifeng's unit towards Wuxuan, and Wei Yunsong's unit is based in Nanning, all engaging in separate activities. Recently, it has been reported that they are utilizing local militias, scattered soldiers, and bandits such as Mo Dexiong and Ying Po's gangs, amassing over two thousand men to create disturbances on the Rongxian-Cangwu Highway. This highway, running from Rongxian to Cangwu, is strategically important. Yu Hanmou, the commander in charge of Guangxi's military affairs, has already dispatched Li Deying's brigade, formerly under Lu Huanyan, to Beiliu and Rongxian to intercept them. On the Wuzhou side, the independent regiment under Zhang Jingcheng is deploying in two directions towards Tengxian and Rongxu to suppress them. As for the defense of Wuzhou, the General Headquarters of Road Construction has transferred the Wujianxiong Regiment of the 61st Division from Guangdong to Cenxi to assist in the suppression. However, the bandits on the Rongxian-Cangwu Highway are merely being used by the enemy to tie up the rear of the Eighth Route Army. The enemy's main force remains between Pingle and Guilin. On the Nanning front, there are only newly formed units under Wei and Lu. Regarding this route, the central government has telegraphed urging the Yunnan Army to advance towards Guangxi to strike at the rear of Nanning. It is reported that the vanguard of the Yunnan Army under Lu Han has already passed through Longzhou and arrived at Taiping County on the 13th of this month, now advancing along the Zuojiang River towards Nanning. With the Yunnan Army pressing in on the Nanning area, the Eighth Route Army is adopting a defensive posture towards the Dahe area. Wujianxiong's regiment has been added to Wuzhou to strengthen defenses. The main force of the 59th Division under Yu Hanmou is advancing in separate routes towards Pingle and Pu, to block the enemy's route from Guilin to Liuzhou. They are also coordinating with the Liu Jianxu and Li Baobing Divisions of the Fourth Route Army, as well as the Li Yangjing and Huang Renhuan units of the Eighth Route Army, which are returning from southern Hunan, to encircle Guilin and Pingle in three directions. Currently, the Liu and Li Divisions of the Xiang Army have already reached Quanzhou, pressing towards Guilin. The Huang Renhuan unit of the Eighth Route Army Teaching Brigade and the Fan Dexing unit of the independent regiment, moving from southern Hunan, are taking the route through Jianghua and Yongming, entering Longhuguan, and on the 14th, have already approached Gongcheng, aiming to flank Pingle. The situation from the Fu River to Pingle is becoming increasingly serious. The Eighth Route Army issued an order yesterday to blockade the Fu River, and no passing ships are allowed without orders from headquarters. The navy has also dispatched ships such as the Long Xiang to control the area. Recently, the Li Chen and Guanghua ships have been transferred from Guangdong to patrol in sections. These ships arrived in Wuzhou on the 15th and set off. On the land route, the Li and Ye brigades of Yu's 59th Division are advancing separately towards Xiangshan, with the Chen Hanguang unit of the Eighth Route Army Guard Regiment as a reserve force, now deployed on the Lipu line. According to a telegram sent by the Chen Regiment from Mengshan on the 14th, the military situation at the front is as follows: "(1) This regiment (i.e., the Chen Regiment) landed at Mengjiang on the 11th and arrived at Taipingxu in Mengshan on the 12th. The local people welcomed our army warmly. We are now scheduled to arrive in Lipu before the 17th to assist Yu's division in intercepting the remaining enemy. (2) The 59th Division departed earlier, arriving in Mengshan on the 11th, and continued to advance. On the 14th, they had already deployed in the Xiuren area of Lipu, preparing to attack the enemy. (3) Our army, including Li Yangjing, Huang Renhuan, and Fan Dexing's units, has decided to cooperate with the Xiang Army to pursue the enemy in Guangxi in four directions. The Li Division will be responsible for two routes, Huang and Fan for one route, and the Xiang Army for one route, forming an encirclement. The various armies are currently advancing and are expected to reach their destinations within a week to launch a simultaneous attack. (4) Yu's division and this regiment will temporarily monitor the enemy's movements in the Lipu area. After the Xiang Army and Li, Huang, and Fan's units arrive at a certain location, we will advance from the rear to launch a pincer attack. (5) Our army has a precise plan for pursuing the remaining enemy in Guangxi this time. (6) The Guangxi army suffered heavy losses while retreating from the western border of Hengyang back to Guangxi, pursued by our army along the way. More than a thousand people drowned while attempting to cross the river in Qiyang when pursued by the Li Division. (7) According to intelligence from Guilin and Liuzhou, only about 5,000 remaining enemy troops have fled back from Hunan, with the greatest losses suffered by Liang Chaoji's division. (8) The remaining enemy troops who have retreated to the Guilin and Pingle areas are afraid of being pursued by our army and will retreat completely to Liuzhou and plan to flee to Nanning again to prolong their lives. We have telegraphed the Yunnan Army to dispatch troops to pursue them." (July 17th)</p>
<h3>Troops from Southern Fujian Will Carry Out the Punitive Expedition Against Lu, Which Will Be Realized</h3>
<p>Under the control and command of Fang Shengtao</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Fang Shengtao's return to Fujian this time was at the urging of Yang Shuzhuang, hoping to thoroughly resolve the Lu Xingbang's troops. Fang had previously discussed a concrete plan with Yang in Shanghai. Therefore, not long after Fang arrived in Xiamen, Yang returned to Fujian. After Fang arrived in Xiamen, he discussed with Zhang Zhen, the commander of the newly编 1st Division for ten days. Xiao Shuxuan, the head of the training corps, also returned to Xiamen from Shanghai to see Fang. After repeated meetings between Fang, Zhang, Xiao, and Hong Wende, the staff officer of Chen Guohui, it was decided that Southern Fujian would send troops. The 1st Division would dispatch the 1st Regiment of the 1st Brigade under Wang Zujing with more than 1,700 men, the 4th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade under Huang Kesheng with more than 1,500 men, the entire 6 battalions and 2 companies of the training corps with more than 2,500 men, together with Chen Guohui's troops of 2,000 men, and the salt suppression team under Liang Jichuan of about 1,000 men, totaling about 9,000 men. This would constitute the Southern Fujian Punitive Expeditionary Force against Lu, under the control and command of Fang. After Xiao Shuxuan returned to Tong'an, the entire training corps concentrated in the county seat and the Dongling area. The entire Wang Regiment of the 1st Division arrived in Tong'an on the 13th, and the 4th Regiment concentrated in Baishuiying, Zhangzhou, sealing ships to prepare for departure. Most of Chen Guohui's brigade also departed, with Chen Mao and a small portion defending Quanzhou and Yongchun. There is talk of Quanzhou being handed over to Chen's troops to take over the defense. Fang Shengtao is residing in Huang Yi's Guanhai Villa on Gulangyu Island. He went to Zhangzhou on the morning of the 17th to meet Zhang Zhen and bid farewell. It is said that after the route of advance is determined and the troops are mobilized, Xiao will go to the front to supervise the advance of his troops, while Fang will take the route from Zhangzhou through Hua'an and Anxi to Yongchun to command.

<h3>Jiaoxian Bandit Troops Completely Resolved</h3>
<p>The 19th Division of Han's troops under Zhao Changqing dispatched troops to incorporate them.</p>
<p>Bandit Leader Ji Xiaoxi Captured at Chengyang Station</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: The conflict between the bandit troops under Ji Xiaoxi, who were entrenched in Jiaoxian County, and the Red Spear Society of the Southern Township has been detailed in a previous letter. The Red Spear Society, hating the bandits to the bone, vowed to avenge their previous grievances. In addition to uniting various township militias to capture the county seat, they also sent people to Zhao Changqing, the commander of the 19th Division of Han Fuqu's troops in Gaoning, requesting military assistance. At the same time, disagreements also arose within the bandit troops. One part secretly surrendered to Commander Zhao, willing to act as internal support. The Division then decided to dispatch troops to Jiaoxian to resolve Ji's troops. The process of resolution is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Internal Strife Among the Bandit Troops: The internal composition of the bandit troops is extremely complex, and can be roughly divided into six parts, namely Wang Shun, Sun Baoshan, the monk Liu Da, Li Xiaoqi, Gao Siming, and Qi Zian, totaling seven or eight hundred people with over three hundred firearms. Wang Shun's troops had the greatest power, followed by Sun Baoshan's troops. Wang relied on his power and looked down on everyone else. All his cronies were appointed to important positions, and his father was appointed as the head of the inspection office to act as his eyes and ears. He also forcibly married a female student, Liu Xiuzhen, as his concubine and extorted various amounts, which had to be handed over to Wang first before being distributed to the various units. Other bandits, although harboring resentment, dared not express it due to his power. Li and Qi, hating Wang's autocracy and selfishness, led their troops out of the city one after another. Recently, a dispute arose with Sun Baoshan's troops, and Sun immediately sent someone secretly to Gaomi to contact Commander Zhao to surrender, willing to kill Wang Shun to prove his sincerity. Commander Zhao immediately agreed and ordered the militia to attack as soon as possible, while he personally led his subordinates and the Gaomi garrison to Jiaoxian Station on the afternoon of the 19th, providing remote support.</p>
<p>Resolution Situation: After Zhao's troops arrived, the township militias continued to attack. The Sun Baoshan's troops inside the city took action at 8:00 PM that evening, first beheading Wang Shun and then surrounding the remaining bandit troops separately. There was a brief battle at the time, which quickly subsided. All the bandits were willing to be reorganized. At dawn the next day, Commander Zhao led his troops into the city to maintain order and instructed the bandits not to engage in robbery anymore and to wait for disposal. When Sun's troops took action, the bandit commander Ji Xiaoxi heard of the change and knew that things were not good. He and his chief of staff Li Yue and several followers sneaked out of the city gate and walked more than forty miles to the Ligezhuang Station, intending to take a train to Qingdao to escape. Unexpectedly, when the train arrived at Chengyang Station, the Marines stationed at the station had received a call from Jiaoxian, stating that the bandit leader Ji had taken a train east and that he must be strictly investigated and arrested. The Marines immediately surrounded the passenger train, boarded it for inspection, and arrested Ji and his followers. More than six thousand silver dollars were found on the bandits. They were escorted to Qingdao tonight. After taking their confessions, it is said that they will be handed over to Commander Zhao for legal punishment. Furthermore, Qi Qingchi, the magistrate of Jiaoxian County, who had taken refuge in Qingdao since the bandit troops occupied Jiaoxian, has now received a telegram from the Jiaoxian County Office, asking him to return to Jiaoxian immediately to handle the aftermath. Qi took a train back to Jiaoxian at 10:45 AM today.</p>
<p>Aftermath: The bandit troops had been entrenched in Jiaoxian for nearly two months, committing adultery, looting, and doing everything evil. They extorted over three hundred thousand yuan in Jiaoxian, and at least several thousand families suffered from their actions, weeping silently with no recourse. The complete resolution of the situation has been praised by everyone far and wide. (October 20th)</p>
<h3>Continuous Rain in Shenyang Causes Disaster</h3>
<p>Traffic on the Beining and Shenhai Routes is Disrupted</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Shenyang suffered from drought before, but then it rained, and the crops flourished. The people were happy, thinking that a bumper harvest was in sight. Unexpectedly, at around 1:00 PM on the 13th of this month, a sudden wind and rain came, like an avalanche, pouring down. The rain began to subside at around 4:00 PM, but it continued incessantly for three days. By the 16th, low-lying streets were all flooded. The Hun River and Liao River near the provincial capital rose sharply, flooding many civilian fields. In the Xinmin and Baiqibao areas of the Beining Route, over a thousand acres of fields were destroyed by the flash floods of the Raoyang River and Liu River. At the same time, the No. 41 iron bridge west of Raoyang River Station was damaged by the flood in three or four sections, so the No. 101 third-class train from Pingkai Shen on the 16th was temporarily intercepted and stopped on the west bank of the Raoyang River. On the 17th, the No. 102 and 16th, as well as the fourth train from Shenkai Ping, were completely suspended. At 6:40 PM that afternoon, only the No. 104 small express train was opened, with tickets sold only to Raoyang River. When the Beining Route Office in Shenyang received this report, it immediately ordered the engineer of Huanggu Village to rush to the rescue with craftsmen. The engineering offices of nearby stations also heard the news and went to the scene to help. There were more than a thousand workers in total. By 6:00 PM in the evening, the repairs were completed, and they were about to test the traffic, but the water was too rapid and was damaged again shortly after, and repairs are still continuing. Fortunately, the sky cleared on the morning of the 18th, and it is expected that the project will be completed around the afternoon of today. All telegrams and long-distance calls from Shenyang to various places, except for the second line of Harbin, were destroyed by wind and rain and were completely interrupted. In the Shenhai Route, between Qingyuan and Yinge, and between Jilin Shanchengzi and Meihegou Xi'an, the water disasters caused obstacles, and the entire line of passenger and freight transportation was suspended. The extent of the damage can be imagined. The Hun River Dam south of the Shenyang commercial port was once in danger on the morning of the 17th. By the next morning, the weather cleared, and the water gradually receded, temporarily avoiding danger. A corner of the wall at the Daxi City Gate collapsed due to rainwater seepage, injuring three pedestrians. There were many other cases of collapsed houses, and the detailed numbers are difficult to count at the moment. However, by 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the sky suddenly changed again, dark clouds gathered, and the rain was lingering. Moreover, due to the continuous rain, department stores were expensive and food prices were increasing day by day. The general poor people sighed to the sky. (July 18th)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Heads North Via Japan</h3>
<p>Osaka Dispatch: Osaka Shosen Kaisha has recently received a telegram from its Hong Kong branch stating that Wang Jingwei and nine others have secretly boarded a Western-style ship in Hong Kong and are heading north. Because the Shanghai side is heavily guarded, the ship will sail directly to Japan and will not dock in Shanghai. It is reported that Chen Youren and his wife are traveling with Wang. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Moji on the morning of the 20th of this month. Wang and others will not land and will transfer to the Changcheng Maru merchant ship, which will depart from Moji for Tianjin at 1:00 PM that afternoon. Wang and others' cabin space for the trip from Japan to Tianjin was arranged with the shipping company in Hong Kong a few days ago. The Changcheng Maru is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin on the morning of the 23rd, and Wang and others are scheduled to arrive in Peiping on the 24th. (July 16th)</p>
<h3>Quick News from Wuhu</h3>
<p>Bao Geng, the newly appointed agent for Anhui's finances by the Ministry of Finance, was the chief of the second section of the Special Envoy Office. He arrived at the office this morning to take office. The meeting of the directors of the provincial Likin Bureau, which was scheduled to be held today by the Special Envoy Office, has been postponed due to the fact that the directors of the Likin Bureaus have not yet arrived, and due to the transition between the old and new Special Envoys.</p>
<p>Gleanings</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>The former director of the Anhui Provincial Sugar Tax Bureau, Gao Peide, had been reappointed.</p>
<p>Subsequently, due to strong opposition from the Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce, the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce, and the sugar merchants of the province, Gao did not take office after arriving in Wuhu and returned to Beijing. Now, Yuan Xingfang has been reappointed to succeed him and took office at 2:00 PM today.</p>
<p>Yu Mingxun, the director of the Wuhu Municipal Public Security Bureau, was ordered to be transferred to the province and replaced by Tang Shaogao, the chief of the General Affairs Section of the Provincial Government. Tang came to Wuhu today and contacted various agencies and groups to coordinate everything. He is scheduled to be sworn in on the 24th.</p>
<p>All sectors held a joint meeting at the General Chamber of Commerce this afternoon to discuss the issue of price stabilization. They all agreed that Anhui Province is expected to have a bumper harvest this year, and rice and grain are entering the city from the countryside every day, so the price of rice is falling. Although price stabilization can be stopped, there are still more than three thousand stones of foreign rice purchased for price stabilization that must be sold. It was decided that the price stabilization rice will be reduced by six copper coins per liter from the 22nd, and will be sold at 380 cash per liter until it is sold out. (July 21st)</p>
<p>Local Dispatches</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Axe Murder Case: Rebellious Daughter-in-Law Arrested. It is reported that Ji Huanzhang, a farmer from the 32nd Tu of the 8th District, was injured by his son Yin Hai with an axe. According to the report from the township head Wang Chao Fu, the cause of the case was entirely instigated by his daughter-in-law Ji Jin, and even the murder weapon was borrowed from a neighbor in advance by the daughter-in-law. At the same time, the investigation by the public security bureau has also confirmed that the eldest son Nanshan was also an accomplice. In addition to Ji Huanzhang himself filing a case against his son for disobedience yesterday, the rebellious daughter-in-law has been arrested and taken to the judiciary for questioning by Bureau Chief Chen today.</p>
<p>Setting up Defensive Works in Zhuanghang: After Zhuanghang was destroyed by the Communist disaster and restored, and learning from previous events, the district office and others discussed setting up defensive works for security. Yesterday, all the alleys in the city were uniformly equipped with iron gates and wooden fences. Sandbags were piled up at the east and west intersections, and bamboo fences were also built in the wasteland and open spaces at the edge of the city. Waterways were also equipped with sluice gates to isolate the inside and outside to facilitate defense. It is said that the cost will be 500 yuan, which is temporarily paid by the district, and will be repaid from a special donation from merchants in the future.</p>
<p>Actual Number of Surtax Collection in the Nineteenth Year: The surtax collection per mu of farmland in this county in the nineteenth year was decided by the second county administrative meeting in the eighteenth year to remain at the standard of two dimes and five cents. All the uses and allocations have been separately designated by the local budget meeting and approved by the provincial government to be followed. The breakdown includes 2.5 cents for party fees (including repayment of old debts), 8 cents for education, 3 cents for construction, 5 cents for public security, 8.5 cents for police, 2 cents for autonomy (including repayment of old surtax debts), 3.5 cents for grain storage, 1.5 cents for agricultural fields, and 2 cents for reserves (including the cost of household registration). However, in order to meet the requirement of 1% of the land price, each is calculated at 96%, and the actual collection per mu is still two dimes and five cents as in the previous year.</p>
<p>The Authority of the Tu Head in the Grain Collection and Finance Bureau: It is ordered by the Department of Finance that since the land bailiffs in each county have now been abolished by order, the grain affairs of the bureau can be handled by others and do not need to be appointed by the county. The proposal to set up the title of "Township Grain Collection Police" to replace them seems inappropriate. According to the report from the Finance Bureau of Jintan County, it is more appropriate to change it to Tu Head. However, if the temporary regulations proposed by the bureau include the collection and immediate payment of busy canal reeds, this is inevitable. It is better to encourage each household to seal and submit their grain themselves. The authority of the Tu Head is limited to grain collection and shall not handle funds. The required food and drink can be planned from the collection fee.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Prisoners Attempt Escape: The buildings in this county's prison are not strong. There was an escape last year, but the prison house has not been repaired. Recently, many bandits and thieves have been captured, and many important criminals are imprisoned. Recently, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters welcomed more than ten important criminals from the Sijing robbery case to Songjiang. Suddenly, at about 8:00 PM last night (the 21st), there was a dangerous attempt to escape again. Fortunately, the internal prison guards noticed that the bandits seemed to be moving, and immediately secretly reported to Warden Zhang, who turned to the police team for strict defense. After entering for inspection, it was found that the shackles of several criminals had been cut off. They were immediately re-imprisoned. It is said that Warden Zhang inspected the shackles today and investigated the person who brought in the cutting knife in order to solve the case and punish them.</p>
<p>Dispute Over a Convenient Steamboat: When a convenient steamboat traveling from Songjiang to Shanyang passed through Yexie Town on the 11th, a team of the 3rd Platoon and two patrol boats, No. 27, of the water police intended to order the boat to tow them. Because the horsepower was insufficient, the request was not granted. The patrolmen went ashore in pursuit, and the passengers were panicked and wanted to jump into the water to escape. The sailors on the boat were also beaten into the water.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>District Heads Resigning: Han Jizhi, the district head of the 17th district of this county, and Feng Qiunong, the district head of the 18th district, submitted their resignations to the county a few days ago. Yesterday (the 22nd), Wang Kecheng, the district head of the 11th district, He Jiazhen, the district head of the 16th district, and Wang Songbao, the district head of the 8th district, also submitted their resignations one after another. In addition, Tao Xiaozhi, the director of the Public Funds and Property Office, died of illness at 9:00 PM on the 21st of this month.</p>
<p>Reactionary Case: Telegraph to the Province for Approval: Bureau Chief Zou of the County Public Security Bureau has been arresting eight people suspected of being reactionary, including Cai Zhihua, in Suzhou for days on end. On the 21st (wrongly written as Zhongshan yesterday), five more people were arrested at Chenglie (formerly Tiyi) Sports Academy. After repeated interrogations by Section Chief Zhang of the Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau, they all confessed that they were planning to organize an Anti-Imperialist League in Suzhou to carry out propaganda work. After receiving the confession, the Public Security Bureau telegraphed the Provincial Department yesterday (the 22nd) to request instructions on how to handle the case.</p>
<p>Counter-Revolutionary Prisoners Escorted to Suzhou: The Songhu Garrison Command sent personnel yesterday (the 22nd) to escort sixteen counter-revolutionary prisoners, Zhou Zhi, He Yijin, Li Shunde, Tu Jingxi, Peng Peixiang, Lin Jie, Zhang Xiaohe Shang, Liu Shichong, Guan Xinhui, Zhang Xianglang, Hou Yuxing, Yin Xuesheng, Lu Baogen, Gu Jiangsheng, Tang Liang, and Ding Zhaolin, to Suzhou to be handed over to the High Court for approval. They were immediately sent to the detention center pending investigation.</p>
<p>Over Two Hundred More Wounded Soldiers Arrived: The 17th Hospital for Wounded Soldiers stationed in Suzhou sent over four hundred wounded soldiers who caused trouble to Nanjing for reorganization, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday (the 22nd), the General Headquarters sent another team to escort over two hundred wounded soldiers to the 15th Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Speaking Publicly Almost Became a Victim of Injustice: Two travelers from Beijing almost became victims of injustice on the night of the wounded soldiers' riot in Suzhou on the 18th. The details are as follows: After Dean Liang of the 17th Rear Hospital resigned, the military appointed Xu Dingmo to succeed him in Suzhou. Xu stayed at Room 53 of the Sanxin Hotel that evening. At around 7:00 PM, there was a disturbance outside the Changmen Gate. A group of wounded soldiers assaulted Zhang Yingguang, a police officer at the 4th Precinct on the Guangji Bridge. Zhang fled to Sanxin. The wounded soldiers did not give up and pursued seven or eight people into the hotel to attack. Xu's brother was angry and blamed Cai, the hotel attendant, for not stopping them. At that time, there were two travelers from Beijing, Xu Jinfang and Cao Dabao, in Room 50 of the adjacent building, who said that even the police officer had been beaten, and the tea attendant had no boxing skills or courage, so how could he stop them? Moreover, the road order had been disrupted, and the stores were closed. This matter should be blamed on the officers in charge of managing the wounded soldiers. Because the new Dean Xu had not yet taken office and was wearing casual clothes, Xu et al. did not know that the person blaming the tea attendant was the dignified dean of the hospital. Xu, hearing this, became angry and slapped Xu and the other person each on the forehead, and then called the Military Police Corps Joint Investigation Office to report, saying that Xu et al. were colluding with the wounded soldiers and instigating the riot. The office, according to the report, immediately sent a team to arrest the two Xu. Xu et al. claimed to be recruitment committee members from a certain division in Beijing going to Huzhou, which further aroused suspicion. Dean Xu also attended the meeting of the Investigation Office the next day, where he reported and strongly testified to the guilt of Xu and Cao, and requested severe punishment. Everyone present believed that at this time of local disturbances, there were vagrants colluding with the wounded soldiers, so it was not enough to punish them by shooting them. Zou Xiaogong, the director of the Public Security Bureau, also held this view. However, Ji Xiaosong, the head of the Chamber of Commerce, alone advocated caution. It was decided to investigate the evidence and then proceed. Afterwards, the incident of Xu and Cao's conflict with Dean Xu at Sanxin gradually came to light. When the matter was heard by Director Zou et al., the lives of the two men were saved, and the previous motion was cancelled. It is now heard that the two men are still being held at the Investigation Office.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Labor-Management Dispute in Silk Factories Escalates: The labor-management dispute in Wuxi's silk factories has been ongoing for over three months without a satisfactory resolution. The situation between the two parties is worsening. The Silk Factory Workers' Union held its 26th joint meeting of factory worker representatives the other day and resolved the following key points: (1) Since the labor-management contract issue has been handed over to the mediation committee, the union should wait patiently for an impartial resolution and refrain from any excessive actions. (2) Male and female members of each factory's workers' union must not be deceived or pressured by the factory to hold private meetings. (3) If a meeting is necessary, the union must be notified in advance to send personnel for guidance. (4) If factory managements compel standing committee members to sign agreements unwilling to increase wages, the union must be consulted first, and the consent of a majority of workers in the county must be obtained for the agreement to take effect. (5) Report to the Party rectification organs immediately to expose the factory's sinister plots. (6) Workers in each factory are extremely indignant at the employers' breach of contract and prolonged failure to resolve the issue, and have designated the union's entire executive supervisory committee, together with members of the workers' rectification association and the county Party committee, to petition the county government for immediate resolution. If no solution is found by Wednesday, they will all resign and bear no further responsibility. After the discussions, the meeting adjourned. Yesterday morning, the entire executive supervisory committee of the Silk Factory Workers' Union, in accordance with the resolutions, accompanied workers' rectification association member Liu Qidi and county Party committee member Zhang Renjie, carrying a petition to the county government. Secretary Xu and Section Chief Lu came out to meet them. The members successively reported the workers' indignation and the urgency of a timely solution. As a result of the talks, Xu and Lu promised to dispatch personnel to the factories before Wednesday to conduct sincere persuasion and await a resolution. The members also decided to hold a temporary meeting today (23rd) to await news. Section Chief Lu agreed to attend and provide guidance with earnest advice, which greatly pleased the members, who then took their leave.</p>
<p>A Large Quantity of Opium Discovered on a Boat: Last month, thirty-six loads of Yunnan opium were smuggled into Wuxi and embezzled, causing a stir throughout the city. Recently, the Sixth Squadron, Second Division of the Water Police captured two suspects involved in the embezzlement. They are currently under intensive interrogation. Unexpectedly, news came that around 10 p.m. the night before, a trafficker named You Helin purchased and smuggled a large quantity of black pill opium from Shanghai on a boat to Wuxi, anchoring it in the Tang River outside the North Gate. This was secretly reported to the county government. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Sun immediately dispatched Chief of Political Police Wu Zhengrong with police officers to conduct a covert arrest at the designated location. As a result, seven packages of "Guo Fu Ren" brand black pills and eleven packages of opium were found in the rice compartment at the stern of the boat. Chief Wu then brought the suspect You Helin and the evidence to the county government, where he was interrogated by Judge Yu. He was ordered to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<p>A Major Suspect Impersonating a Garrison Commander Apprehended: Since receiving news of the disturbances caused by wounded soldiers in Suzhou, rumors have been rampant in Wuxi in recent days. At 8 p.m. the night before, the South Gate Guard Post was suddenly approached by a man claiming to be Zhu Maoquan, who reported that several wounded soldiers from Suzhou were coming to Wuxi and had already passed through Huguan, arriving shortly. He urged the gate to be closed earlier. The patrol leader of the Guard Post, citing that the gate closing time required orders from superiors and could not be decided arbitrarily, obtained the man's business card and forwarded it to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Bureau Chief Gao Chongshan examined the card, which read "Zhu Maoquan" at the top, "Commander of the 31st Regiment of the National Revolutionary Army, 17th Army" in the middle, and "Tangtou Town, Beixiang, Wuxi, Jiangsu" at the bottom. Suspecting many points, he immediately telegraphed to detain the man and reported to the Public Security Bureau. Inspector Qian Tianxiong rushed to the South Gate, escorted Zhu to the Public Security Bureau, where he confessed to impersonation. It was also heard that some people were planning to cause trouble and rob that night, but fortunately, the swift apprehension prevented any incidents. This was truly fortunate.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Robberies Occur in Two Districts: On the morning of the 20th, around 1 a.m., the home of Wu A'gen in Huang'gou Village, Xinghua Township, Fourth District of Wujin County, was robbed, with minimal losses. The robbers then went to the homes of neighbors Wu Shunhai and Wu Ronghe to rob. They attempted to kidnap Shunhai's child, but relented after pleading. Ronghe's wife, fearing for her life, jumped into the river to escape. The robbers loudly assured her that they would not harm her, and she then came ashore and fled. After the robbery, the robbers headed southwest. Also, the home of Yao Hongmao in Jiangshu Village, Second District, was robbed the day before. Hongmao's wife was dragged out and beaten, suffering burns all over her body, endangering her life. About seven hundred yuan in cash, clothing, and jewelry were stolen. The township head has reported the incident to the county and requested an investigation.</p>
<p>Student Commits Suicide Due to Debt: Jiang Pengying, a 17-year-old from Shuqiao Village in the western part of Wujin County, was a student at the Suzhou Physical Education School. During his summer vacation, he owed the school over fifty yuan. After returning home, Pengying asked his father for the money, but was refused. He then came to the city the other day, checked into the Yuanyuan Inn, secretly bought opium for four dimes and two buttons from his coat, and ingested them all. After his family arrived and learned of the situation, they took Pengying to Wujin Hospital for treatment on the 21st.</p>
<p>Maid Found Dead in Well: The maid employed by Su Shaomei, who lived across from the Canglong in Juqian Street in Wujin County, was 59 years old. For unknown reasons, she took advantage of a moment when no one was looking and jumped into a well. Her body was only discovered on the 21st. There are conflicting accounts of the reason for her suicide. Some say the maid went home once and was upset about something, while others say she was abused by her employer. The Su family has instructed people to go to her village to bring her family to the city to handle the funeral arrangements.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Meeting on Ways to Comfort Wounded Soldiers: The county government has established the 25th Rear Hospital, and over a thousand wounded soldiers will be transferred to Cheng for recuperation. Yesterday, a meeting was held with over twenty representatives from various agencies and organizations. It was decided to form a "Committee for Comforting Wounded Soldiers," with thirteen members designated by the county government from various agencies. The committee will establish general affairs, medical affairs, and propaganda sections to comfort the wounded soldiers. The county will inquire with neighboring counties of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou about how to cover the various expenses. All miscellaneous expenses, such as hiring rickshaws, will be temporarily covered by the Asset Management Office. It was decided to designate one representative from the county government, the Public Security Bureau, and various agencies to visit the hospital director at the 25th Rear Hospital at 8 a.m. today (22nd) and hold a public banquet at the Chamber of Commerce at 6 p.m. to show the hospitality of the locals. The necessary expenses will be shared by the various agencies. The specific methods of comforting the wounded soldiers after they arrive in Jiangyin will be decided later. Due to the weak local armed forces, the maintenance of public order is crucial. It is proposed to establish a joint military-police inspection station, with teams from the fortress headquarters' Gendarmerie Company and the naval, land police, and Chamber of Commerce patrolling each month to provide security. The county will convene a separate meeting of armed agencies to decide how to form the inspection station. The meeting adjourned after discussions.</p>
<p>Girl Drowns on Licheng Ferry: At 9 a.m. on the 21st, the early shift of the Licheng ferry arrived at the Nanzha area. Lu Heting's second daughter, Er'mei (17 years old), from Dongwaicang Linqiao, was traveling to Shanghai's Yangshupu Gongda Factory for work. She accidentally fell into the river from the smoking shed and drowned. Her body had not yet been recovered by evening. Her companion, Aunt Liu, notified her family.</p>
<p>Closing Arguments in Xue Shibao Murder Case: Yesterday morning, the county government summoned witnesses Hua Du, Zhou Xue Fengquan, and brought Xue Shibao in for questioning regarding the murder case at Sihetangtou Bridge. According to Hua Du's testimony, Xue Shibao shot and killed Huang Wangchun and Chen Ruilin. At the time, he was passing by and Xue gave him the handgun. He gave it to the security regiment, and later hired a boat to send Huang to Wuxi for treatment. He did not know what happened afterward. Xue Fengquan testified that he saw Xue take white medicine. He did not know if Xue surrendered or not. Xue Shibao stated two key points: (1) He suddenly had a desire to die and intended to shoot Xue Picheng, but mistakenly killed Chen and Huang. (2) Realizing the mistake, he immediately went to the township security regiment to surrender and was willing to accept punishment. He asked the judge to pay attention to these two points. As a result, Judge Yang announced that the closing arguments in the case were over and that the sentencing would be announced at a later date.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Temporary Martial Law in Nantong City: With the banditry in the four townships of Nantong still unresolved, and now the arrival of over a thousand wounded soldiers, the local populace is feeling shaken.

<p>Large Group of Pirates Invades Wolf Mountain Area: Along the Nantong Wolf Mountain area's riverfront, thirty or more pirate ships suddenly arrived at dawn on the 21st, fully loaded with bandits carrying firearms.

<p>Massive Suppression of Bandits in Tong, Ru, and Tai Areas: Bandits are rampant in the border area where Tong, Ru, and Tai counties meet.

<p>Various Sectors Telegraph Request to Transfer Wounded Soldiers from Guanyin Temple: Over 2,600 wounded soldiers were transported from Pukou to Nantong. The 31st Rear Hospital is insufficient to accommodate them all, and 600 or more have been moved to Guanyin Temple on Wolf Mountain.

(2) The case of temporarily suspending the work comrades of various departments and offices to await appointment was passed. Transportation in Jingjiang is Gradually Becoming More Convenient: Jingjiang County is remotely located in northern Jiangsu, and transportation has always been inconvenient. Recently, with the completion of the Jiangjing Road, a rickshaw company was first established this spring, followed by horse-drawn carriages. Now, public buses are also running. The 20 li distance from Jiangbin to Jingcheng can be covered in twenty minutes, providing convenience for travelers.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Guerrilla Team Captures Bandits: The Shanghai Bandit Suppression Headquarters specially appointed Pan Meiting to form a guerrilla team to search for and capture gangs of bandits along the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border. On the 17th, over fifty plainclothes soldiers from the team encountered several dozen bandits from the Taibao A'shu gang near the Dongtingzi Bridge in Langxia, at the Jin-Ping border. They engaged in a fierce battle for about half an hour. The bandits fled south in disarray. Five were captured on the spot, and a son of Yu A'he was killed. Five guns were seized. The bandit leader, Zhu Luo A'mei, was also among them but escaped by jumping into the water. On the 18th, the team learned that a certain surname family, about three li northeast of Langxia, was harboring many bandits. They changed into civilian clothes, boarded a boat, and searched the house at night. Five people were captured in a shed and two handguns and one Mauser pistol were seized. The others had already fled. They were immediately escorted back to Langxia and sent to the government of Zhujing Jinshan County for interrogation.</p>
<p>Jiang Jinkun Sent to Province for Interrogation: The Second Battalion of the Zhuping Security Team recently captured a man impersonating a military officer named Jiang Jinjie at the north end of Hanshui Bridge in Dongcheng. After interrogation by Battalion Commander Zhao, his statements were incoherent, suggesting that he was mentally ill. He carried a business card with the title of Adjutant of the Jiangbei Guerrilla Headquarters, which has been sent to the Provincial Security Office for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Navy Launches Large-Scale Patrol and Suppression: The Zhoushan and Wenzhou-Taizhou waters off the Zhejiang coast are dotted with islands, serving as hideouts for pirates. Every fishing season, large gangs of pirates emerge to harass the area. The Ministry of the Navy, recognizing the recent surge in piracy in Zhejiang waters, has not only dispatched the Jingxing gunboat to cooperate with the Zhejiang Foreign Waters Police Bureau in a joint suppression effort but has also sent torpedo patrol boats, Lianjing, Jiankang, Yuzhang, Hupeng, Hu等 (characters unreadable in original text) and other vessels for a large-scale patrol and suppression, aiming for a fundamental eradication of the pirates.</p>
<p>Large Number of Workers, Military on Alert: In Yuyao City, the early rice harvest is about to begin, and thousands of rice-cutting workers from other counties have come to seek employment. The county security team, concerned about the large number of workers and the possibility of unscrupulous elements mingling among them, has dispatched many soldiers to guard key points in the city and conduct strict inspections at the railway station and wharves. Yesterday, when the Yao ferry arrived, over a dozen suspicious passengers, upon seeing the military police boarding the ship for inspection, jumped into the river and fled towards the south bank. The security team soldiers attempted to cross the river and give chase but were unable to find them. The military police authorities, realizing that bandits were indeed mingling among the rice-cutting workers, have stepped up their security measures. Kidnapping Case at Mount Dalang: The home of farmer Yu 　Ren (character unreadable in original text) in Banpi Village, Mount Dalang, northern Yuyao, was raided by over ten bandits around 11 p.m. the other day. They broke down the door and warned everyone to remain silent. Yu's grandson, Da'ya, who was only six years old, had nowhere to hide and was abducted. The mistress of the house, seeing her grandson being kidnapped, rushed forward to grab hold of him. The bandits, enraged, struck her on the head several times with the butt of a gun, causing serious injuries, and then took Da'ya away.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Execution of Robbery-Murder Convicts: In January of this year, the Shaocao Duan automobile was suddenly attacked by a group of bandits firing guns in the vicinity of Fanjiang.

They have now been sentenced. Wei Rongzhang, Gao Kuixian, Han Huide, Wang Xueyou, and the other four were sentenced to death. Zhao Zongsheng, Ma Xiude, Zhang Tianxi, Niu Zhongzhou, Jia Qinglin, Li Zhanglin, and the other six, whose involvement was deemed less serious, were sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment. In addition to those serving prison sentences being sent to their respective prisons, the four convicts sentenced to death, Wei Rongzhang, and the others, were escorted to Shaoxing on the afternoon of the 21st for execution. After County Magistrate Tang Jianting confirmed their identities, they were escorted to the scene of the crime near Fanjiang outside Wuyun Gate and executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Changxing</h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Rescues Female Hostage: Changxing County has long been a haven for bandits, and this spring, they have been further incited by reactionary factions, causing banditry to become even more rampant. Shou Jie, the 29-year-old daughter of wealthy businessman Shen Rongfu in the county seat, was abducted by bandits while in Langshan Village. Her whereabouts were unknown. A letter was received from the bandits demanding 80,000 yuan in ransom. After Shen Rongfu reported to the Public Security Bureau, Ken Pei (two characters unreadable in original text), many skilled detectives were dispatched to rescue her. In Langshan Village, bandits were found hiding in the home of a Dong surname. Having been alerted, they opened fire to resist arrest. The detectives bravely returned fire, injuring several bandits on the spot and killing one. The remaining bandits, unable to withstand the pressure, scattered. A wooden-cased pistol was seized. Three suspected female criminals, all young and beautiful women, were found in the Dong family home, as well as several male criminals, all of whom were taken to the bureau for interrogation. After further investigation revealed the location where the bandits were hiding the female hostage, another team was sent to the Zhuxi Bridge area the next day at dawn, rescuing the hostage Shen Shou Jie.</p>
<p>The team was dispatched to Zhouxi Bridge. After searching the home of Tang family due to the dim lighting, the bandits fired from across the river, wounding police officer Tao Jinbiao. The Changxing police continued to advance bravely. The bandits fled and the female hostage, Shen Shou Jie, was rescued by police on a small boat. She was returned to Shen Rongfu. The wounded police officer is said to be receiving medical treatment, and fortunately, his life is not in danger.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>

If any are still found after the deadline, the responsible officials will be held accountable.</p>
<p>Bandits from Jiande Flee to Chunhua: The bandits in Jiande, under pressure, fled to Chun'an, Jinhua, and Lanxi areas. The provincial government has now received reports that they have been found in Suian, calling themselves the "Great Han People's Army," and are advancing towards Fenghua Changhua. The county magistrates of both counties have sent urgent telegrams for help. It is reported that another provincial instructor team has been dispatched to assist in the suppression. Investigation of the Assailant in the Shen Dingyi Case: Qian Jiagen, the assailant in the assassination of Shen Dingyi, was apprehended in the East Special District Court. The Zhejiang High Court sent personnel to escort him back to Zhejiang, where he was temporarily detained. Yesterday, Judge Gu Hongbiao of the Hangzhou Local Court brought the accused before the court for interrogation. Qian denied the charges. However, suspected accomplices Yuan Nanzhao and Xing Jianxiong were brought forward to testify, both claiming that they were instructed and paid by Qian. The final verdict is pending a scheduled announcement.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Township Heads of the Twentieth District Resign Jointly: The township heads of the twentieth district of Hefei, due to the exhaustion of funds and depletion of ammunition after the drought, are unable to suppress bandits. Li Li, Cai Kuai, Chu Zhen, and others have jointly and resolutely resigned to the county government to avoid delays and mistakes.</p>
<p>Township Head Accused of Confiscating Weapons and Apprehended: Ding Jingbo, the township head of the southern section of the Donger Township District, was previously accused by the residents of the district of various crimes. Lu Guilin of the Provincial Committee came to Hefei to investigate and handle the matter. Yesterday, accompanied by Wang Youbin, the deputy commander of the local defense corps, he went to the township to verify the accusations, which were found to be true. The corps weapons were confiscated, and Ding was handed over to the county government for further action in accordance with instructions from the provincial government.</p>

<h3>Church Schools Prohibited from Displaying Religious Books</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Circular to Provincial and Municipal Education Bureaus for Compliance (Central News Agency) The Ministry of Education yesterday issued a circular to the education bureaus of all provinces and municipalities, strictly prohibiting libraries in church schools from displaying books and pictures that promote religion, in order to avoid intoxicating the minds of young people. The original order reads as follows:</p>
<p>Based on the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee's letter No. 1468, regarding the Jiangxi Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee's report on the display of religious books and newspapers in the libraries of church schools in various places, which intoxicates the minds of young people. It is requested to forward this report to the Central Government and instruct the Ministry of Education to order its subordinates to strictly prohibit this in order to prevent future troubles.</p>
<p>It has been found that imperialism uses cultural propaganda as a tool for aggression, bewitching the minds of young people and implementing poisonous plans to destroy the country and exterminate the race. The Chinese people, aware of their treacherousness, have launched passionate movements to resist imperialist cultural aggression in various places, to awaken the Chinese people and to strike a blow against the aggressors. Recently, church schools and societies have again used libraries as places for students to study academic subjects, displaying various religious books, newspapers, and pictures for invisible propaganda. On the other hand, books on party principles are few and far between. Such a reversal of priorities is not a phenomenon that schools should have under party rule. Young people are the lifeline of the nation. If their minds are intoxicated by foreigners, the impact on the survival of the nation is self-evident. This office, in view of this, resolved at the 24th committee meeting to submit a report to the province for forwarding to the central government for strict prohibition. It is appropriate to record the case and submit it for examination and approval, and to investigate and prohibit it, in order to prevent future troubles, etc.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of this, it was found that the matters reported are not without reason. Whether or not to prohibit it immediately and what methods to adopt for prohibition concern general church schools throughout the country, and we dared not act without authorization. Therefore, we have prepared a document and submitted it to your Ministry for examination and instruction. According to this, it is found that church schools in various places display various religious books and newspapers in their libraries for students to read, which inevitably affects the students' thinking. The reports submitted are quite insightful. Your ministry should be requested to instruct its subordinates to find ways to strictly prohibit this. It is found that church schools display religious books, newspapers, and pictures in their libraries, hoping to intoxicate the minds of young people, which should be strictly investigated and prohibited. From now on, all religious propaganda pictures in all schools should be prohibited from being displayed or hung. As for books, newspapers, and magazines related to religion, except in universities and senior high schools, where they are limited to those related to elective courses and those that can be used as philosophical references, they should be displayed in moderation. All others should be prohibited. In addition to separate orders, we hereby order you to comply and forward this order for compliance.</p>
<h3>Ministry Order: Do Not Accept</h3>
<p>Japanese Subsidies for Chinese Cultural Undertakings</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education urgently orders all national universities and specialized schools, provincial education bureaus, and the office of the supervisor of students studying in Japan: It has been found that when various middle and higher schools, academic groups, and educational administrative organs in the country went to Japan for inspection in the past, they received subsidies from the Japanese Department of Cultural Affairs for China. This is detrimental to the national prestige. Now that negotiations are underway to abolish the Sino-Japanese Cultural Undertakings Agreement, in the future, whether groups or individuals go to Japan for investigation, they must not receive the aforementioned expenses again. You must comply and forward this order for unified compliance by your subordinates.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Notifies High School and Middle School Credits</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a circular to the education bureaus of all provinces and municipalities and national universities with middle schools, stating that according to the resolution of the drafting committee for middle and primary school curriculum standards, the time for Party Principles in high school and middle school will remain at two hours per week, changed to three years, for a total of twelve credits. The total number of credits for middle school has been increased to 186, and the total number of credits for general science in high school is 156. This should be implemented from today.</p>

<h3>National Vocational Education Conference Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Next Conference Location: Peiping, Annual Chairman: Tongji University</p>
<p>Second General Assembly</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the 11th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Vocational Education Society and the 8th Annual Meeting of the National Vocational Education Institutions Joint Association. The meeting was held at the Social Education Society Auditorium at 9:00 AM. Seventy-one people attended, including Zhong Daozan, Zhou Mingyi, Gu Xuhou, Liu Zhanen, Huang Jingwan, Wang Zuocai, He Bingsong, Pan Yangyao, Shi She, Yuan Xihao, Huang Renzhi, Li Banghe, Pan Jianqing, Yang Weiyu, Jiang Wenyu, Hu Chunzao, Yao Huiquan, Wu Cuilun, and Cai Huang. After formal greetings, Hu Shuhua was publicly elected as chairman. Jiang Wenyu, Yao Huiquan, Yang Weiyu, and Pan Yangyao successively reported on the proceedings of the first day's general assembly and the second day's group meetings, followed by discussions on:</p>
<p>(A) Zhong Daozan reported on three proposals: (1) Change the annual meeting resolutions to discussion topics, that is, raise the difficulties felt by each institution and the most insightful point for discussion, so as to be adopted. (2) Six months before each meeting, jointly decide on the central issue of the next or current meeting, such as moral education, communication, teaching methods, graduate outlets, and remediation. Pre-appoint several experts to draft the topic scope and procedures so that members are prepared. (3) There is no concise report from each vocational school at each meeting, lacking contact research. In the future, the General Assembly should prepare a report format in advance for them to fill out, and it can be compiled into a report for reference after the meeting.</p>
<p>Jiang Wenyu, regarding the first proposal, advocated that the Vocational Education Society Office be responsible for investigating the insights of each school, submitting them to the Society within a time limit, and appointing several experts to be responsible for research and publishing publications. Li Banghe, regarding the second proposal, advocated analyzing the central issue into investigation, research, and convening a meeting for one or two months, publishing publications, and summarizing the plan to promote several members to be in charge, or to be organized by the Office. Pan Yangyao seconded. Jiang Wenyu advocated that the Chinese Vocational School Moral Education Standards were jointly drafted with the Society. Shen Gongjian and Chen Qingshi of the Society are psychological testing experts and also participated in the matter. Many schools pay attention to this point. Can we ask each school to appoint several people to study the issues related to guidance and graduate outlets? The Vocational School Liaison Association should appoint several people. If it cannot be appointed, it can be entrusted to the Vocational Education Society to organize. The above issues should be thoroughly studied and have greater effectiveness. Li Banghe said that the central issue should be specified. Zhong Daozan advocated that it should be less rather than more. Li Banghe advocated that it should be based on the number of central issues. Jiang Wenyu said that central issues such as graduate outlets are all important. Yang Weiyu said that the intentions of Mr. Jiang and Mr. Li can be summarized into two issues: (1) Graduate outlet issues (the vocational guidance center must contact the vocational industry). (2) Teaching issues, such as clear goals and a large scope. Pan Jianqing advocated that each report can be made into a general report by the committee and submitted for discussion. Li Banghe said that in addition to the two proposals proposed by Mr. Yang Weiyu, a case of vocational cultivation can be added. Pan Yangyao seconded, and said that there are too few central issues, and because members have their own expertise, the chairman advocated that women's household affairs and rural education issues should be added. Li Banghe seconded and automatically canceled the original proposal. Then Wang Xing, Pan Yangyao, Huang Qisheng, and Jiang Wenyu successively discussed. As a result, the Vocational Education Society Office organized a proposal committee, soliciting central issues from each school and institution, and publishing them half a year before the meeting, while also publishing the plan. The entire proposal was passed. The next item was the location of the next Vocational Education Institutions Joint Association and the annual chairman case. Pan Yangyao, Zhong Daozan, and Yang Weiyu successively spoke and decided on Peiping, with Liaoning and Xiamen as candidate locations. The entire proposal passed.</p>
<p>The annual chairman was decided to be Tongji University, with Xiangshan Ciyouyuan as the candidate. Liu Zhanen proposed that the Vocational Education Society has been established for twelve years, and all were due to the hard work of the Office and the Board of Directors. The Society is the highest organ of the Vocational Education Society, and gratitude should be expressed. It was resolved to write a letter of thanks in the name of the general assembly.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Huang gave a speech on why vocational education should be promoted. Mr. Shen gave a speech on the true meaning of frugality at home and diligence in the country, which was very detailed.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Jiang Wenyu said that the Society's general assembly has received the enthusiastic presence of everyone, and the command and supervision of the deliberation department is like a small shopkeeper. The highest organ is the general assembly of members, like a big shopkeeper. However, the Office has many tasks and few people, and colleagues are deeply afraid of overstepping. I hope that everyone will often give guidance so that the grand theory can be published in the Society's monthly journal. This is the first hope for everyone. In addition, the colleagues in the Office can say without shame that there are three points: (1) dare not be greedy and lazy, (2) dare not act rashly, (3) dare not waste. Because the Society receives subsidies from the country and society, the source of funds is not easy, so every penny must be used to achieve the effect of three pennies, so that it can be worthy of the country and society. Please everyone often use this to blame and spur each other, so as to avoid mistakes. This is the second hope for everyone. In addition, as the Society's business is gradually expanding, such as agriculture, industry, commerce, education, supplementary schools, morning schools, vocational guidance centers, and correspondence schools are gradually being established, resulting in insufficient office space. Without considering the limitations, we boldly built the Society's premises, with a construction cost of 70,000 yuan, of which 50,000 yuan was borrowed by Mr. Qian Xin, Chairman of the Committee. In the future, we plan to engage in fundraising, hoping that everyone will provide direct or indirect help. This is another request for everyone. At the same time, we must apologize to everyone. This general assembly happened to coincide with the Society's relocation, with few people and hot weather. The accommodation and layout were not complete. Please forgive all kinds of shortcomings.</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>Next, the chairman gave a closing speech. The enthusiasm of everyone's attendance this time is like the furnace in a steel mill, and I am afraid that the degrees on the thermometer cannot be compared. Therefore, I am very happy to follow everyone in discussing various issues. This is the crystallization of everyone's fighting spirit. I believe that doing things is not in empty words, but in practice. I hope that everyone will not be complacent about this and strive to achieve the goal of combining wealth and education. In a few years, the Society's premises will be insufficient again, which can be congratulated in advance.</p>
<p>Finally, Yang Weiyu reported that the special issue of this general assembly will be published within two months. It was noon, so the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and 17 other institutions and organizations welcomed everyone at the New New Restaurant. At 7:00 PM, guests and hosts gathered, totaling more than 100 people. Educators and industrialists gathered together. Hu Shuhua, He Bocheng, and Jin Wenqi were publicly elected as chairmen. Halfway through the banquet, Hu Shuhua and others stood up to give welcome speeches, and Ma Chonggan and others gave speeches until 10:00 PM, when they took a photo and dispersed. The speeches are recorded below.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>Teacher: Children, you should understand reason through your studies and know the principle of forgiveness. If your classmates insult or beat you, can you forgive them?</p>
<p>Student: If he is older than me and stronger than me, of course I will forgive him.</p>
<p>A: The two ladies on either side of your house are insulting each other and are about to fight. Can you go and mediate?</p>
<p>B: What are they fighting about?</p>
<p>A: One is scolding the other for being ugly, and the other is scolding the first for having an affair.</p>
<p>B: Then I'm sorry, I can't help. These kinds of things are the most difficult to resolve among women.</p>
<p>Beggar (to an old maid begging for money): Beautiful lady, please give alms to a poor beggar. I wish you a house full of children in the future.</p>
<p>Old Maid: You are very sensible. Take two dimes.</p>
<p>Husband: Although you are not beautiful, my love for you is as deep as for an extremely beautiful wife.</p>
<p>Wife: Although you are not smart, my love for you is as deep as for an extremely smart husband.</p>
<p>Husband: I may be late coming home tonight from the club. You don't have to wait up for me.</p>
<p>Wife: I will definitely not wait up for you. I will come out and find you.</p>
<h3>A Record of General Zhu Qinglan, Zhi Zheng</h3>
<p>General Zhu Qinglan, style name Ziqiao, travels tirelessly and earnestly urging disaster relief. He is honest, upright, and has the air of an ancient knight-errant. There are many anecdotal stories about his life worth recording, so I will record one or two to inform the world.</p>
<p>General Zhu had a friend who unfortunately died in middle age. On his deathbed, he entrusted his orphans and wife to Zhu. Zhu wept and promised to take care of them. After taking care of the funeral, he immediately sent his friend's son to school. The friend was poor, and he often provided financial assistance to his family. At that time, General Zhu's situation was also very difficult, but his assistance was never lacking. When his friend's son graduated from a certain school, because of Zhu's strict teachings on weekdays, his academic performance was outstanding. He went to see Zhu, wanting to obtain a place to earn a living. Zhu scolded him and said, "I am not someone who can be approached for personal gain. If you have learned something, take good care of yourself, which is the only way to repay your father in the underworld." Before long, his friend's son was still living in poverty. Zhu then introduced him to a small silver shop. The position was very low, but the work was very heavy. He told people, "Young people easily tend to be boastful. They must be tempered before they can become great talents." Those who heard this all agreed.</p>
<p>In his early years, General Zhu and Mr. Zhang Jian ran salt farming in Nantong. From his home to the port, it was several dozen miles. Zhu always walked there, carrying his luggage himself, without relying on others. His sons and others who accompanied him all suffered deeply.</p>
<p>This time, the Shaanxi disaster was extremely severe. General Zhu braved the hot summer to personally solicit donations and distribute relief funds. People, because of General Zhu's honesty and uprightness, were happy to donate generously. Because of this, in Harbin alone, he received 70,000 yuan in one day. His heart for the people and things, I suppose, is also a natural instinct.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Orangutan Blood and Poison Gas Bombs by Zhang Yan</h3>
<p>My close friend, Mr. Zhang Xiaocheng, served as a senior military doctor under Wu Peifu for many years. After Wu's failure, Mr. Zhang went north to Yandu and south to Fujian and Guangdong. When he was tired of traveling, he returned to Nanjing, built a thatched hut at the foot of Yuhuatai Mountain, and used the mountains and waters to entertain himself, taking full advantage of his leisure time. I met him yesterday, and after many years of separation, we drank and talked happily. He mentioned that those who were poisoned by artillery fire and fell unconscious could be revived by smelling orangutan blood. This was a new piece of information, so I recorded it to provide to chemists for research.</p>
<p>When Wu Peifu sent troops to Xifengkou in the thirteenth year of the Republic, he took several orangutans and monkeys with him. (According to old newspapers, this matter was recorded. Readers may be able to recall it.) However, the world only knew that these orangutans and monkeys were used to lay electric nets and landmines. In fact, this equipment was needed to avoid poison gas. Before Wu and the Northeast broke up, he purchased thousands of orangutans and monkeys from the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan and transported them to the front line. To outsiders, he only said that they were assisting the engineers. In fact, they had other uses. When officers and soldiers smelled the poison gas in battle, they would all fall down immediately. Those in the rear defense would kill the orangutans and monkeys, put their blood in bowls, and smear it on the noses of those who had fainted. They would immediately wake up. It was said that the blood of the largest orangutan could save forty people. Although monkeys were small, they could also save one or twenty people. Mr. Zhang participated in the battle and was the one who personally administered the treatment. These words should not be false.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Repeated Words from Wuhu, Sent from Wuhu with Humility</h3>
<p>I, your humble servant, previously troubled readers with matters of Wuhu. However, since there are still things unsaid, I record them again to continue the tale.</p>
<p>Wuhu's Municipal Administration: Wuhu's municipal administration recently has a preparatory office planning things. The director is Mr. Shao Yizhou, whose mind is quite modern and seems to be working hard on various projects. However, the unevenness of Wuhu's streets is truly lamentable, making walking difficult. The rickshaws in Wuhu, as mentioned a few days ago in Brother Zhizheng's "Small Records of a Suzhou Tour" in this publication, have large horns and foot bells. The "woo-woo" sound often makes one suspect it's a car. The rickshaws themselves are very flimsy. Riding them on the uneven streets requires one to constantly grip the handrails tightly, and even then, there's the discomfort of being tossed from side to side. I often take one from the office to my residence at the Customs Transportation Bureau and constantly complain. Moreover, because there's no running water, residents rely on river water for drinking. Each day, water carriers deliver it to each household. However, these carriers are often careless, and water spills everywhere they go. Especially places like Chang Street, Temple Wharf Street, and Guanyi Alley are muddy all year round, causing passersby to sigh. In reality, the municipal administration could easily require each carrier to have a lid for their bucket, which they must close tightly when carrying water. This would prevent this problem and facilitate travel. The unevenness of the roads requires construction funds and planning time. Adding a bucket lid is a simple matter. I wonder if the energetic and proactive Director Shao agrees with my humble opinion.</p>
<p>Three Remaining One Film Theater: There were originally three movie theaters, named "Wuhu," "National," and "Star." They showed a mix of Chinese and foreign films. In terms of location and layout, "Wuhu" was better. "National" used the auditorium of the Hubei Guild Hall, but its advantage was using a screen without a white cloth. "Star" seemed slightly inferior. All used new-style double-projector setups. Recently, "National" and "Star" have successively closed temporarily, ostensibly for repairs. However, there are other difficult reasons behind it. Currently, only "Wuhu" is showing films, twice daily at 2:30 PM and 8:15 PM. The most expensive ticket costs fifty cents. Chinese films with a slightly engaging plot can fill the seats. European and American films can only attract audiences if they are comedies or starring well-known actors like Fairbanks. If the films feature lesser-known actors, even if the films are excellent, the attendance is sparse.</p>
<p>Clear Voices Reach Little West Lake: In the evenings, besides movies, there are no other recreational activities. (There was talk of opening a performing arts theater in front of the Zhongjiang Opera Stage on the 16th, but it was later converted into a wounded soldiers' hospital, so that was canceled.) There are only clear singing performances similar to the "Girls' School Gathering" style. Previously, the only place with clear singing was a teahouse on Zhongshan Road, where the sound of drums filled the air in the evenings, breaking the silence. Recently, the Little West Lake teahouse, located by the lake, added clear singing starting from the 15th. Little West Lake is quite cool in the evenings. I wonder if the quality of the singing is good and if the business is more prosperous than before.</p>
<h3>New Maritime Invention by Li Shuping</h3>
<p>Ocean navigation, watching the clouds rise and fall, the sun and moon rise and set, and listening to the ebb and flow of the tide, can be said to be the beautiful scenery of the extremely natural world. Coupled with the shipboard entertainment facilities, such as movies and singing and dancing, all are enough to ease the mind. However, the trouble with seasickness is that the voyage of dozens of days is spent in the cabin, and thus this beautiful realm cannot be enjoyed, which is inevitable unfortunately. Although the medical community has repeatedly used drugs to defend against it, all have been ineffective. A French mechanic named C. Folly believes that the fundamental method lies in preventing the ship's swaying. Therefore, he worked hard to research and recently invented a device with excellent test results. The method is to use iron to make a deformed eight-winged shape, with two wings in each row, placed at the front, back, left, and right of the ship's draft. Another mechanism can arbitrarily extend and retract the iron wings. When the ship is sailing smoothly, the wings are all hidden under the bottom of the ship. If the bow of the ship rises, the two wings at the stern are extended, and the bow will naturally lower. If the stern of the ship rises, then extend the two wings at the bow. If the ship</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Records of Mei Lanfang's Tour of the United States</h3>
<p>The president of the Pan-Pacific Union addressed Mei Lanfang, saying, "The purpose of this association is to connect the emotions of various parts of the Pacific. Although we have worked for many years, the effect is not as great as Mr. Mei's trip. After reading the reports from various newspapers, one can know the great achievements of Mr. Mei in connecting the emotions of the Pacific. The important countries of the Pacific are the United States, China, and Japan, and all three countries have expressed their welcome to Mr. Mei. Mr. Mei should be the first person welcomed by all sectors of Pacific nations. Our association especially sincerely blesses him. If there is any place where this association is needed this time, please notify us at any time, and we will definitely help with all our strength. This is not our association helping Mr. Mei, but Mr. Mei helping our association, because it is in line with the purpose of this association." After speaking, he took a photo with Mr. Mei and all members, and returned to the hotel. The hotel is named ROYAL HAWAIIAN HOTEL, built on the seaside with excellent scenery. After a short rest, the two former governors invited him to a tea party. More than 100 people attended, including many people from academia and the theater world. There were also many local gentry and merchants.</p>
<p>On the 19th, at 4 o'clock, the current governor hosted a tea party with a musical band. All the important local figures attended, such as the commander-in-chief of the fleet, the commander-in-chief of the army fortress, the mayor, consuls of various countries, the customs supervisor, the director of the immigration bureau, the chairman of the chamber of commerce, the president of the liberal arts school, professors, principals of various schools, and the main figures of various institutions and groups. There were three former governors, major capitalists, and so on, a total of about 100 people. The governor's wife was especially sincere in her hospitality and presented Mr. Mei with an extremely large flower garland to be tied around his neck, saying, "This style was once worn by the former king. We must have music to celebrate." So she ordered the band to sing native songs, which were very pleasant to the ear. The governor had time to speak to Mr. Mei, saying, "The local dignitaries are all gathered here today. I should introduce them to you one by one." Later, they took a photo together. The party ended at 6 o'clock in the evening. In the evening, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce held a welcome party. About a thousand people attended. There were also many foreigners. There were local overseas Chinese girls dancing. There were two native dances, which were especially graceful. The party ended after 10 o'clock.</p>
<p>On the 20th, the Consul-General came to the residence, saying that many important people here wanted to buy tickets but could not get them. He asked if he could find a way. He immediately went to the theater to check, and the tickets had been sold out three days earlier. So, he found a way to lay boards in the area of the orchestra in front of the stage to set up more than 20 seats. He discussed it with the convention, which readily agreed. The situation here is excellent. The ticket price is more than five yuan. According to local people, this is an expensive ticket that has never been seen before. However, buyers are still enthusiastically buying them. It can be seen the people's feelings. Roughly, there will be performances here for five days, and then one more day of free performance to help the local school funds. The total is six days. The ship sways from side to side. If it leans to the left, the wings on the right are extended. If it leans to the right, the wings on the left are extended. In short, they restrain each other, and the ship's body is naturally stable. It is suitable for ships of all sizes. C. Folly also said that the invention of this device can replace the rudder and can also avoid the danger of hitting rocks. He is currently conducting precise research to achieve perfection.</p>
<h3>On Gifting a Painting of Rocks by Female Disciple Fan Yingchu</h3>
<p>Ms. Fan Xiu of Chongming is the daughter of my friend, the old painter Shaoyun. She once studied poetry with me, and I named her Yingchu. Her painting brush is deeply beautiful, delicate and full of moisture, with origins from family education. She is truly a disciple of the second generation of Mr. Lu Lianfu of Songlu. Shaoyun himself came to Wumen and was taught by Mr. Lu for many years. Yingchu has painted fans for me for many years. I once told her that if she accumulates them, she could bind them into a fan album, and arrange them by year, so she can compare the degree of progress. Yingchu was delighted and complacent. In the third month of the year Wuchen, it was my sixtieth birthday. Yingchu painted a vertical axis as a birthday gift, and I asked her to write a poem that did not reveal the birthday intention, lest it be seen by old friends and disciples of Wumen during mounting, or that they pester me with birthday matters. Yingchu wrote a five-character poem, saying: "Heaven and earth are full of dust, why ask about stripping and restoring? In chaotic times, one plans for survival, quietly engaging in farming and reading. A hill and a gully are leisure, living in seclusion in the Linwu. It fits my intentions and matches the painting." I was very happy. This summer, she gave me another painted fan, titled "Pine Valley Crying Spring," with a profound and thick spirit, greatly resembling the artistic conception of Mr. Gu Ruobo of the Wu school. Ancient people have said, "A scholar should be treated with new eyes after three days of separation." I haven't seen Yingchu for two years. It is appropriate that her progress is rapid, like this. So, I wrote a poem to report it: "The wind and rain of the lake and mountains are different each day, I trouble you to ask about my declining years in a painted tent. The refreshing energy surges through my chest, connecting the peaks of green. The clear sound reaches my ears, singing from the springs of the valleys. The new words of Huang Xuan are like a young woman, the old studies of the red boudoir scatter the immortals." (I recklessly play the role of professor at the Zhenhua Girls' School in Wumen. Those who are residing here from various provinces such as Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, those ladies often came to study and that's why my poem from the year Wuchen has "In the past twenty years, people and I grow old, Red boudoir disciples throughout Jiangnan.") "I am grateful for your distant thoughts of the old man in the village, a corner of the stream and forest is placed on the table. I once gave Yingchu the Collection of Lu Weinan. I haven't talked to her about poetry for a long time. Now that I have her painting, the artistic conception is beyond the ordinary, it seems to combine her poetry. There is poetry in painting, so why let ancient people monopolize that claim?"</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (339) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 13: Who Unintentionally Plants Blessings and Gains a Mine of Gems, Only This Fate Sings the Golden Thread with Intent</p>
<p>At that time, Zuo Shichen felt very embarrassed. He wanted to turn around and look at them, but he was too shy to turn around and look at them. Long Ziyun had already noticed that Zuo Shichen was a bit uneasy, so she said, "Shichen, shall I switch seats with you?" Zuo Shichen quickly said, "No, no." Long Ziyun said, "Switching seats would make it easier for everyone, saving you the trouble of turning around, and saving him from only looking at the back of your head." Zuo Shichen shook his head and said, "I can't switch seats. If I do, he won't even dare to look at me. He'll only talk to other people. It'll be hard to say if he'll leave this place." As Zuo Shichen said those words, he saw Long Ziyun looking at the opposite side and said, "Oh, are they really leaving? Are they really going to leave this place?" Zuo Shichen also quickly looked back. It turned out that only Ruiyun and a thirteen- or fourteen-year-old girl stood up. He only heard Ruiyun's clear voice saying, "Little Miss, let's go for a walk. There's still a quarter of an hour before the fireworks." He saw her supporting the little girl's hand and walking on the grass. At this time, Zuo Shichen saw her whole body. He saw her wearing a short, parrot-green, cooked silk shirt, and a high-waisted skirt of primary-colored silk, which was blown by the evening breeze, creating an image of floating like an immortal. He saw that she had a recently popular "fallen horse bun," and two hair shadows that seemed like cicada wings. The bangs on her forehead almost covered the top of her shoulders. The yellow orchids on her bun were emitting a faint fragrance, competing for the authority of the misty world with the large jasmine flower ball hanging on her chest. He saw that she was carrying a square, soft, silver silk purse, with the silver chain of the purse wrapped around the back of her hand. The other hand was holding a white fan of eagle feathers, whiter than snow. In the center of the feather fan, there was a green velvet ball, the same as the jade bracelet on her arm, showing green from the powder white. He saw her snow-white silk stockings, slightly revealing the beauty of the curve of her legs, wearing a pair of flat-bottomed shoes embroidered with ink gold fish in white foreign satin. What Zuo Shichen found strange was that a year ago, when she was about to get married, she was still a little girl. Now, she was clearly a young woman. When she stood up, she seemed to be half a head taller than before. Even her face was much fuller than before. She had truly become an adult. Then he thought of how Hanyun had met her once at the table last month, and even sang a song. She told me that her older sister had already given birth to a child. So, she had already become a mother. I still look at her with the eyes of a little girl. I still look at her with the eyes of a barefoot village girl from the past. This is like a noble person of the Yuan Dynasty talking about the poor friends of the past. It can be said to be the same as not recognizing the times.</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn　Yarn Market Listless, Downstream Trend</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending weak due to the decline in American cotton, which has caused anxiety. The market situation is declining. Although the sales of spot yarn are good, there is a lack of large-volume business, due to the impact of the war. Most people are pessimistic, and buyers are adopting a firm attitude, unwilling to relax. Also, due to the hot weather, the production of various factories has decreased, and several factories have even stopped work. Therefore, although there are adverse conditions, new sellers do not dare to act rashly, so the market has not experienced a major drop.</p>

<h3>Recent Shanghai Cotton Prices Fall by Half a Taels</h3>
<p>American Cotton Falls Fiercely… Indian Cotton Arrives in Large Quantities</p>
<p>The cotton market has been very weak recently, with a sharp decline. In fact, the sales of spot cotton are stagnant, and Indian cotton is arriving in a steady stream. Therefore, although the bottom inventory is thinner than last year, the situation is still in a bad state. Now, American cotton has fallen again by 50 points due to good weather, and most people in the local market are pessimistic. With the help of the sluggish foreign cotton, the market decline is even more severe. However, as the production situation after the distant months is not well grasped, there are fewer sellers, and the market atmosphere is slightly higher.</p>

<h3>Food　White Rice Drops Step by Step</h3>
<p>Dongxin Market Remains Flat</p>
<p>Zhabei　Yesterday, over 20 boats arrived from Hexia, but sales were slow and few transactions took place, so there are already about 70 boats in stock here. Changxi and other goods, Northern Rice, fell by about half a cent, and top-grade still requires 21 yuan. However, there is very little of this type of rice. All Zhongguan white rice must be 23 cents short, and no one asks about the inferior ones even if they fall in price. The step-by-step decline in the market is a reaction after the big rise. The Dongxin rice wholesale market is very flat, still opening at 21 yuan. Now, the factory machine white rice has been sold one after another, so the boat rice will gradually be squeezed. In short, the price of white rice has no hope of standing firm. Yangdu pointed rice market is weakening. Although the arrivals are not strong, it has taken a sharp turn due to the large drop in foreign rice. Only Baiyuan is standing firm in the whole city, because there have been a few special sales recently, and the stock is also scarce, so the market is similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>Hunan, Shanghai　About ten boats arrived from Hexia, and Dongxin also saw a slight arrival. Sales in this street are not smooth, and machine rice continues to be revised. However, the top grades are flat, and the remaining high-quality and ordinary grades are short by 12 cents. Rice at the 20 yuan mark in the South Market is already very impressive. Thin rice follows the rice market, and its removal is weak. The price is similar to that of machine rice, with the wholesale market falling by about 22 cents. Yang pointed rice has fallen sharply, because the drop in foreign rice is very sharp. It is found that the public association's rough small-grain rice is only opening at 10 yuan, and No. 1 Saigon is also only at the 17 yuan mark. Therefore, this kind of rice has plummeted. The stock of high-quality Bian rice is very small, and the sales market in Zhongguan is flat. The situation also feels soft. The new high-quality rice is still opening at 21 yuan, but this price may not be easy to stand firm.</p>
<h3>The Wild Rise after the Dire Fall of Small-Grain Rough Rice</h3>
<p>Rising and Falling by One Yuan and Ten Cents in One Day</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation had significant fluctuations in the morning and afternoon. After the market opened in the morning, it continued the weak trend of the previous day, and both local and foreign customers were mainly watching and hesitant to buy. They were eager to sell, and medium-quality rice especially wanted to sell at a reduced price. Small-grain rough rice fell from a little over 10 yuan to 10 yuan. Although the goods were slightly inferior, they were more than one and a half yuan less than the previous day, which was unprecedented since the foreign rice market. Large and small grain white rice also followed suit, and the market almost had an unstoppable downward trend. Such a tragic fall was unexpected. However, after each rice fell slightly, it was suddenly noticed by the Hangzhou gang. In addition to buying large and small grain white rice, they especially paid attention to small-grain rough rice. As soon as the Hangzhou gang took action, various customers followed suit, and local customers also inquired. Small-grain rough rice rose sharply to 12.1 yuan, with a difference of more than one yuan in one day. A total of more than 6,000 bags were sold. Large and small grain rice also rose and fell by 35 cents. It is estimated that more than 3,000 bags of large grain rice were sold at prices ranging from 12.1 yuan to 11.8 yuan, and 3,000 bags of small grain rice were sold at prices ranging from 14.4 yuan to 13.8 yuan. 700 bags of No. 1 Saigon were sold at a high price of 17.2 yuan, and ordinary rice was sold at 16.9 yuan, which was slightly more stable than the last sales opening the previous day, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Ultimately Difficult to Advance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month once again experienced a tragic phenomenon of violent decline at the beginning. The quoted price of foreign wheat has returned to about 89 cents, and most people in the market believe that there will be a good harvest everywhere due to early maturity. The largest sales port of Tianjin is currently under blockade, which has caused a pessimistic atmosphere to envelop the market. Therefore, at the opening, this month fell to a minimum of two taels four and a half cash, August fell to two taels four cash two cents two and a half li, September fell to two taels four cash two cents seven and a half li, October and November both fell to two taels four and a half cash, and December fell to two taels four cash five and a half li, which was 234 points less than the previous day. After the second round, due to short covering, those who went short also stopped. Therefore, the market situation showed a slight rebound, but the entire transaction was still extremely chaotic. According to the speculation of ordinary people, it is believed that the actual sales cannot afford it, and the subsequent steps may be difficult to look good. As a result, this month was a little over two li less than the previous day, August fell one and a half points, September fell one point, October fell seven and a half li, November fell one point, and December fell seven and a half li, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Slightly Rebounded on Short Covering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning, the market for each month was still not good at first, falling 34 points less than the previous day's closing. However, at that time, the market situation was unusually chaotic with ups and downs. Then, due to short covering, it rebounded slightly. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market situation turned slightly stable. The Tin Gang also replenished their positions from time to time, and the quantity was quite large. However, according to the speculation of ordinary people, after all, the flour sales are not strong, and manufacturers intend to wait and see for the need for wheat. At this peak season, the arrival of goods in various places has become smooth, and even in terms of the stock in this port, it has reached more than 100,000 bags. Therefore, hoping for the market to rebound, the accumulated goods must be sold smoothly, and people's minds can be changed. As a result, this month was two points less than the previous day, August was one point more, September was three points more, October and November were both two points more, and December was two points less. The current wheat market, with the continuous decline in recent days, the trend has stabilized slightly. Because the highest and lowest difference in the past two weeks has reached a huge 34 cash, manufacturers have also allocated and entered 8,000 bags of Yao Wan's new and old wheat, Shashi Xinyang Jiangxi wheat from time to time, which were handled by various factories, it is said.</p>
<h3>Beancake Futures Fall Even More Sharply</h3>
<p>Continued to Fall One Cent in the Morning… Rebounded About Four Points in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of standard beancake futures fell sharply at the beginning of the morning. The strong selling pressure from various gangs can be said to be rare, causing the July lower period to return to one tael eight cash seven points, which was one cent more than the previous day. In total, it has to be two cents less in two days, setting a new record for this year. Later, because customers from the Dalian gang saw this situation and had the intention of maintaining it, they slightly recovered their positions, and some short covering and oil factory gangs also slightly entered the market. As a result, the market immediately improved, and as a result in the afternoon, it was about four points better, at one tael nine cash one and a half points, which was six points less than the previous day. The market situation was extremely chaotic throughout the day, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market　Japanese Sugar Factory Opens 40,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Raw Sugar White Eight Taels Leave Customs</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Cuban spot sugar price was still 1.25, New York sugar futures were 1.19, down two points, December was 1.28, down one point, March next year was 1.38, down two points, May was 1.46, down one point. Java spot sugar futures still lacked ups and downs. The public association's raw sugar white market atmosphere was quite strong, and the inventory was even thinner. The asking price had reached eight taels and five points, but because the Japanese sugar market was flat and the buying atmosphere was silent, the price still remained at eight taels, slightly trading, the market form was extremely strong. 20th grade medium sugar white was seven taels eight and a half cash, 8th grade Dutch red was six taels six and a half cash, 12th grade high quality was seven taels and five points, and the asking price of seven taels one cash was still rarely accepted. The market image was all excellent. Japanese sugar, with the factory plate, Minghua sugar continued to open 20,000 bags, Y.T. mark, the price was seven taels nine and a half cash, and Meiji sugar also opened 20,000 bags, the price was six taels three and a half cash, new corrugated iron was added to the tax, all for August delivery, and the remaining marks were added as before. Therefore, the market atmosphere was slightly flat, and the trading was even more rare. Y.R.O. mark was seven taels nine cash two and a half points, Y.T. mark was eight taels five points, N. mark was eight taels one cash, Y.P. mark was eight taels two cash seven and a half points. The market form was not surprising. The stock of Binghua Qing was again very scarce. Yesterday, Yu Zi Hao opened more than one hundred bags of Binghua arriving within four days, the price was eight taels two cash, which still felt good, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea　Italian New Summer Cocoons Hit the Market</h3>
<p>Sales Stagnant, Price is Low, Only Opening at Eighty-Six Lira</p>
<p>Italy's summer cocoon harvest this year is not abundant. The new cocoons have already hit the market, but the sales of Italian silk in Europe are sluggish, and factory sales cannot afford it. The price of cocoons is surprisingly low. Summer dried cocoons are only opening at eighty-six lira per kilo, and spring dried cocoons have also fallen below the one hundred lira mark, it is said.</p>
<p>[P Eight Cocoon Gray Silk Approved for Exemption from Inspection&gt;</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau was ordered to inspect exported raw silk, starting with the inspection and taking of public weight of silk from factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Since the implementation, three months have passed. Both Chinese and foreign silk merchants have expressed their approval. It is now planned to implement inspection of domestic silk produced in various provinces. However, domestic silk merchants believe that the situation of domestic silk is complex, making it difficult to inspect everything. The Ministry has strongly argued. Now, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has found that eight cocoon gray silk passes through the warp, the silk quality is poor and may change color or rot after baking, and cannot be inspected for public weight. Yesterday, it ordered the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau that eight cocoon gray silk and gray warp, regardless of net weight or public weight, should be exempted from inspection. Silk merchants should check and comply with this, it is said.</p>
<h3>Russian Company to Handle Gongxi Tea</h3>
<p>Since the Russian Assistance Association opened Qining Huaxiang in the local tea market, the market has suddenly become lively. Gongxi is a major category for Russian sales. Yesterday, the industry here invited various tea shops to conduct negotiations, but the prices offered were too low, which disappointed Chinese merchants. Zhenmei green tea, Jardine Matheson, Tianxiang, and other companies all have intentions to enter the market, but currently they are still picking high-quality tea. The medium and low-quality goods will not be active until August and September, it is said.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods　Strong Orders Arrive; Eastern Piece Goods Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>As the hot summer arrives, the sales of piece goods have become largely quiet. Yesterday, Eastern goods became even weaker. This is because the goods ordered for July have been arriving in Shanghai one after another, and it happens to be a time when local customers are quiet, resulting in a situation where supply exceeds demand. Fine serge fell slightly by half a cent yesterday, Four Scholars opened at two cash, Fawn Fur seven and a half li, Lakeside Pavilion two cash five points, some Baoqiu were sold at two cash eight points seven and a half li, most must be nine points. Cotton flannel has a tendency to fall again and again. Fuhua big red was one cash eight and a half points yesterday, and it has been sold off. Concubine color was one cash seven and a half points, and dark-colored patterned ting also fell slightly. Western red standard Chongbiao silk all fell by about five points. Yuehua velvet has not changed much in recent days. Because of the shortage of goods, various colored Zhigong cloth are quite popular. Shuangtong Deer must be two cash six points two and a half li, Sanyou Tu Western blue two cash six and a half points, Mei Lanfang, San Tonger bald big red and bald Gui are all two cash five and a half points. Western goods Yuanchong Zhigong cloth opened yesterday, Deji Shaking Money Tree was six cash nine points, and Hua Ji Siji Facai was six cash seven and a half points, an increase of four to five points compared to before, it is said.</p>
<h3>Metals; British Steel Plates Sell Well to Tianjin Gang</h3>
<p>Yesterday's metal market situation was idle due to limited actual transactions. Apart from fancy goods, the whole city felt that large-scale transactions were very rare. However, the Tianjin Gang was very excited about the British steel plate business. It was heard that Tongfaxiang, Hongchang, Deguang, and Juede all received telegrams from the local area to collect them, so they opened as many as 2,000 sheets. The standard is tending to be more stable, and sales are said to be good. The current price is two and a half cents sold at eleven taels two cash five cents, seven points and a half are seven taels five cash, and one point is six taels eight cash five cents. Because the sales of thick fancy goods are less, the market has not increased or decreased, it is said.</p>

<h3>Building a Bronze Statue of Premier</h3>
<p>Progress of Preparations</p>
<p>The Construction Committee of the Premier's Bronze Statue Preparatory Committee convened another Standing Committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday to continue discussing various aspects of the progress. It was heard that the attendees that day included representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, representatives from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Government, representatives from the Two-Roads Administration Bureau, and business representative Wang Xiaolai, who went to Hangzhou a few days ago due to business and did not attend. The issues raised for discussion that day were to elect committee members to first review the submitted designs, and then discuss the implementation methods after the review report is presented to the meeting. It was heard that the committee members believe that the construction of the statue is to commemorate the Premier, which is not only a matter of admiration, but also concerns appearance, so the handling is extremely cautious, it is said.</p>
<h3>Concession Telephone Rights Case</h3>
<p>Striving for Recovery</p>
<p>Letters and Telegrams Flying</p>
<p>User Association Receives Reply Telegram from the Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company Chinese User Association received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, which stated: "Your telegram regarding the Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company's bidding for the concession telephone rights has been received. This matter not only hinders national sovereignty but also has a vital connection with the local populace. Your association, recognizing this, has united Chinese users, organized groups, and strived to resist, demonstrating profound patriotic fervor. We deeply admire and appreciate this. Currently, this ministry has already consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to engage in serious negotiations to ensure thorough implementation. We hope that you will pool your wisdom and efforts, unite as one, emulate Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, and strive diligently, hoping for ultimate victory. This is what this ministry earnestly expects." Signed, Ma, Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>User Association Sends Letter to Envoy Wu</p>
<p>A letter was sent yesterday to our country's envoy to the United States, Wu Chaoshu, Esq.: "With utmost respect, we inform you that our country's telegraph and telephone industry is state-operated, as stipulated in Article 2 of the Telecommunications Regulations promulgated on April 18th of the Republic of China's fourth year. Article 3 of the same regulations also clearly stipulates that private telephone installations within a certain area must be authorized by the government. Since the establishment of the National Government in Nanjing, the state operation of telegraph and telephone services has not changed, and it is clearly stipulated that private telephone installations must be approved by the government. Therefore, telephone services within a specific area are actually related to national communication and must be approved by the government. This is not a unique practice in our country but is a common practice in legal systems of all countries. The Shanghai concession is a part of our country's territory. Therefore, within this area, without the approval of our government, it is impermissible for any individual or organization to privately operate a telephone business. Because the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company's operations were not approved by the government and its management was unsuitable, our Ministry of Communications, starting last September, consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to devise a way to recover and operate it ourselves. In the future, the business pricing will solely aim to maintain the prosperity of the business and the interests of commercial shareholders, which is incomparable to the sole pursuit of profit by foreign merchants. However, that company disregarded our national sovereignty and ignored the government's protests and the people's opposition, and brazenly held a special shareholders' meeting on June 27th of this year. When no Chinese shareholders were present, it recklessly decided to sell the company to the International Telephone and Telegraph Company. Its arbitrary and domineering behavior is already deeply resented. Furthermore, the International Telephone and Telegraph Company did not submit a request for approval to our government but rashly purchased the company and obtained a forty-year patent right from the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Shanghai concession, which our government is preparing to recover. It is evident that they dare to disregard our national sovereignty and violate our country's laws. Moreover, the International Company's sole purpose is to seek profit. According to its bidding plan, it estimates its net operating profit to be as high as 10.5%. Therefore, there will be no limit to future increases in telephone usage fees, and the losses to users will inevitably be unavoidable. We, the members of this association, are all users of the Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company. In the past, we have already suffered greatly from the poor telephone service of the Shanghai Telephone Company. Now, in order to uphold national sovereignty, maintain the authority of the law, and protect the interests of users, we find it utterly intolerable. We firmly believe that it is insufficient to safeguard national rights and seek improvement unless the entire concession telephone business is recovered by our government or approved and supervised by the government. Therefore, we have specially organized the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company Chinese User Association, preparing to adopt effective non-cooperation measures to resist the company and to be a backing for the government. According to reports, Shanghai American Consul Ke Yinhann stated in a letter to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on June 26th of this year that the granting of patent rights for the telephone business is within the full authority of the Municipal Council, according to the Yangjingbang Regulations. Regardless of whether the Yangjingbang Regulations have always lacked a provision for the Municipal Council to freely dispose of telephone patent rights, even if there were, the regulations are the product of unequal treaties, and the abolition of unequal treaties is a policy that the party-state is urgently seeking to realize. How can foreigners be allowed to intensify and cause harm in the future? Their far-fetched arguments are even more obvious. Now, the reasons why this matter cannot be ignored are listed as follows: (1) China's telephone business is state-operated, and private telephone installations must be authorized by the government, as clearly stipulated by law. Now, the International Telephone and Telegraph Company rashly purchased the assets of the Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company without awaiting approval from our government and privately obtained a forty-year patent right from the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, which is a violation of our country's laws. (2) The Shanghai concession is merely a foreign residence. Our government retains absolute supreme sovereignty and is a part of our country's territory. Operating a telephone business within Chinese territory naturally requires the approval of our government. However, the International Telephone and Telegraph Company did not request approval from our government and hastily began operations, which is also an infringement of our national sovereignty. (3) The Yangjingbang Regulations do not state that the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council has the right to grant private individuals telephone patent rights. Judging from the nature of the telephone business, it is related to national communication. The quality of telephone services in one area is sufficient to hinder national communication. Moreover, the Chinese and concession areas of Shanghai are adjacent to each other, and their telephone operations must be unified and orderly. Therefore, the granting of this patent right is by no means a matter of local administration, and the Municipal Council naturally does not have the authority to obstruct our country's communications administration. (4) Telephone services are public utilities and should respect the wishes of the majority of users. However, the company's bidding and sale have not sought the opinions of users and are purely based on private interests. (5) The Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company's previous telephone business had extended its telephone lines beyond the concession area, to the areas of so-called cross-border road construction, which will inevitably lead to continuous disputes in the future. In summary, it can be seen that this matter is serious. However, the company brazenly disregarded this and, according to reports, will sign the agreement and formally take over within ten days. We, the members of this association, are filled with righteous indignation. In addition to submitting a request to the government for a serious protest and arousing all the people of Shanghai to rise up and be a backing for the government, we should also write to your envoy, directly raising serious negotiations with the U.S. government and urging the American people to pay attention to our national sovereignty and not to take reckless actions to avoid harming the friendship between our two countries. As national rights are at stake, we urgently submit our plea, hoping for your consideration and wishing you well."</p>
<p>User Association Sends Letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>A letter was also sent to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting support. It stated briefly that China's telephone business is clearly defined as state-operated, and the International Telephone and Telegraph Company's purchase of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company's assets without the approval of our government disregards our national sovereignty. Although the company has been repeatedly protested by our government and opposed by the public, it has turned a deaf ear. We, the members of this association, are filled with righteous indignation and dare not remain silent. In addition to submitting a request to the government for a serious protest and seeking to recover and operate it ourselves, we will also take various effective measures to absolutely not cooperate with the International Telephone and Telegraph Company in order to uphold national sovereignty and maintain the interests of the Chinese people. Please give your full support. Not only will users benefit greatly, but the national sovereignty and practical interests will also rely on it.</p>
<p>Resolutions of the Special Committee of the Citizens' Association</p>
<p>The Citizens' Federation convened the second committee meeting of the special committee on telephone issues at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. Eight committee members were present, including Yu Hualong, Jiang Xinzhao, Xu Yunhui, Yu Zhongxian, Zhang Mohai, Zheng Chengqing, Zhang Xianfang, and Qiu Jialiang. Yu Hualong chaired the meeting. (1) Formalities were observed. (2) Committee members Yu Hualong and Yu Zhongxian reported that they had visited Li Zuyu and Yu Jun of the Chinese Telephone User Association in the morning with committee members Hu Fengxiang and Zhang Yichen. Mr. Li expressed that the association is actively proceeding and is very willing to unite and cooperate. (3) It was resolved to notify all Chinese citizen telephone users to join the Chinese Telephone User Association as members as soon as possible in order to concentrate their strength and work together. (4) Committee members Yu Hualong, Yu Zhongxian, Jiang Xinzhao, and Zheng Chengqing were elected as representatives to be responsible for contacting and cooperating with the Chinese Telephone User Association at any time to facilitate progress. (5) Committee member Jiang Xinzhao proposed a passive resistance method. If the Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company implements the transfer and sale to the International Company, could this association unite with various important public organizations in the city to jointly notify all Chinese telephone users to uniformly stop paying telephone fees in order to resist the case? Resolved and passed to be implemented when necessary. (6) Committee member Qiu Jialiang proposed that the sale of the telephone is of great importance. The Taxpaying Chinese Association is an organization of taxpaying Chinese, but it has not yet actively carried out opposition work. The Chinese directors of the Municipal Council have also not made any expression or action, which is a great disappointment to the trust of the citizens. Should a warning be issued? Resolved and passed to be submitted to the entire organizing committee to issue a written warning to the Taxpayers' Association and the Chinese directors in order to encourage them. The meeting adjourned after the agenda was completed.</p>
<p>Letter from the Citizens' Association to the Taxpayers' Association</p>
<p>The Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Taxpaying Chinese Association yesterday, which stated: "With utmost respect, we inform you that we have received instructions from the Shanghai Municipal Party Department to strive to oppose the sale of the concession telephone. Our association has already followed these instructions and organized a special committee on telephone issues to actively carry out this task. However, we have found that taxpaying Chinese account for the majority of concession telephone users. All of us taxpaying Chinese should unite as one and resolutely oppose this to the end. However, this matter is of great importance and the timing is urgent. It is difficult to reverse the situation without pooling our wisdom and efforts to deal with it with all our strength. Your association is an organization of taxpaying Chinese within the concession. At this time when a major municipal issue has arisen within the concession, you should temporarily convene a meeting of all representatives of the taxpaying Chinese and strive to struggle in order to achieve the final goal. Having been resolved by the second committee meeting of our association, we hereby write to your association, requesting that you immediately convene a general meeting of all representatives to actively discuss opposition methods in order to strengthen our power and protect our sovereignty. We hope that you will accommodate the public opinion of the taxpaying citizens, consult your association's constitution, and immediately convene an emergency general meeting of representatives for urgent discussion. This would be a public service, etc."</p>
<h3>Tense Situation in the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>Support Conference Resolves Important Cases</p>
<p>Various Organizations Declare Support</p>
<p>Since the French Concession water and electricity workers' strike resulted in a tragedy the day before yesterday, all circles have been filled with righteous indignation, especially the Support Association. The details of yesterday's events are recorded below:</p>
<p>Number of People Arrested</p>
<p>There are a total of twenty-four arrested workers in the police station. However, according to the union's investigation, there are a total of twenty-seven people, including Xu Jinbiao, Zhu Guangde, Yan Rongsheng, Zhao Ada, Qin Zhixiang, and Yao Asan from the old and new workshops; Mao Longhai from the switchboard room; Xu Awu from the main line room; Yang Kouzi, Wu Buyun, and Zhu Wensheng from the engineering department; Xu Zhengshan, Li Amao, Xiao Laizi, and Da Heshang from the railway workers; Xu Ahai and Huang Zicai from the engine room; Gu Agen, Qian Ashun, Zhou Wenzi, Mao Zhongxiao, Yao Amao, and Jiang Zhanggen from the lathe room; Sun Yifu, Dong Zhiping, and Zhang Desheng from the main line room; and Wei Baoyuan from the Dongjiadu water meter and water line room. It is still unknown whether these twenty-seven people were transferred to the hospital by the police station or are temporarily missing. Many others who were not arrested but returned to the Chinese territory. The most serious injuries were Xu Shigui, Pan Jinzi, and Gao Dezhen. Xu Shigui is currently recovering at home, while Gao and Pan have been transferred by the union to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Post-Incident Condolences</p>
<p>Various organizations in Shanghai have been continuously visiting the union to express their condolences after the incident. The union has also sent people to visit the arrested workers. It is said that they are being treated well and have not been questioned at all.</p>
<p>Traffic Conditions</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, all trams remained suspended. Around 3 p.m., a few trams started running to prevent traffic from being completely cut off. Each tram was carrying four Chinese and Vietnamese policemen, and an armed car with volunteer detectives followed behind to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Union General Meeting</p>
<p>The union held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. at the public sports field. More than a thousand workers attended. Zhang Yaoming and Mao Yun were sent by the Municipal Party Department to provide guidance. Zhu Guilin, representing the Social Affairs Bureau, and Chen Peide, representing the Support Association, and more than 30 people participated. Zhang Qixiang chaired the meeting, observed formalities, and reported on the bloodshed and the capital's continued lack of understanding. He said that today, a group of previously dismissed unemployed tram drivers and ticket sellers were still being sent into the company, forcing them to drive the trams. Therefore, a small number of trams (about two or three) were still running in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Representative Speeches</p>
<p>After Mao Yun's speech as the representative of the Municipal Party Department, speeches were given by Zhu Guilin, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau; Chen Depei and Lu Jingshi of the Support Association; Jin Yongchang, the representative of the Silk Factory Workers' Union; Tang Junsheng, the representative of the Chinese Electrical Workers' Union; Wang Wenhua of the Commercial Workers' Union; Zhou Xuexiang of the Huacheng Workers' Union; Zhang Linhua of the Xiangsheng Workers' Union; Yang Chunfang of the Pudong Electrical Workers' Union; Xu Shaochuan of the Dried Goods Workers' Union; Gu Jiren of the Wine Workers' Union; Gu Yongquan of the Mercerized Silk Workers' Union; and Lu Guanhong, Zhang Sanbao, and Shen Keming of the Company Staff and Transport Department. All the speeches were passionate and full of grief and indignation.</p>
<p>Resolutions on Important Cases</p>
<p>Many important cases were discussed at the meeting. The following resolutions were adopted: (1) A warning will be issued to all workers who have not joined the strike, requiring them to register at the union immediately. (2) A joint letter will be sent to the French Consul General, advocating for fairness to promote the capital's enlightenment and strengthen diplomatic relations. (3) The press will be asked to unanimously support the strike. (4) A request will be submitted to the higher authorities to severely punish those who undermine the labor movement.</p>
<p>Warning to Staff</p>
<p>The company's Chinese staff, including more than 60 people, have participated in the workers' movement to show their support. However, the union suddenly received reports that Shao Zhiqi, a factory dog, was doing his best to sabotage the movement. On the one hand, he strictly prohibited staff who had not joined the strike from doing so. On the other hand, he used vicious means to dismiss those who had participated in the strike and would recruit replacements from various schools. After receiving this information, the union decided on the following measures: (1) A warning will be issued to Shao Zhiying. (2) All schools and circles will be notified that, before the resolution of the labor dispute, no one will be allowed to be recruited by the French company. Violators will be considered to be undermining the labor movement.</p>
<p>Support Association Meeting</p>

<p>The Support Association's Letter to New Workers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Trade Unions' Support Association for the French Water and Electricity Workers' Union addresses the new workers of the French Water and Electricity Company: "Fellow workers, humanity has a spirit of mutual assistance, which enables us to overcome all things and have a foothold in the world without being enslaved or subdued by other species. Therefore, humanity is called the most intelligent of all things. Looking back at us Chinese, we are often tempted by petty forces and do not hesitate to destroy our own compatriots. There is no mention of mutual assistance between people of the same kind. This is the biggest reason for creating a weak society. This time, the French Water and Electricity Workers' Union asked to improve the conditions, but the French imperialist capitalists sternly refused, resulting in a strike. This is a very unfortunate event for the French Water and Electricity Workers. All compatriots should show sympathy and assistance to promote the capital's early enlightenment and save the French Water and Electricity Workers who are in dire straits. Unexpectedly, there are those who are even more ruthless than French imperialists: their own Chinese. They were tempted by money and ignored the lives of the striking workers of the French Water and Electricity Company. They forgot their origins and destroyed their kind, and during this strike period, they joined the French Water and Electricity Company to grab the jobs of the striking workers. This matter directly makes the attitude of the French imperialist capitalists even stronger and indirectly puts more than 800 workers to death. You must know the vicious methods of the imperialists.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Of course, they are very polite and peaceful when they use you. But when the time is right, they will be rude and you will have nowhere to go. Who will you ask for help at that time? This association believes that the new workers who have joined the French Water and Electricity Company this time are the scum of the workers, and they must be fundamentally eliminated. But in consideration of the workers' weak knowledge and love for their compatriots, we hereby solemnly warn you that many new workers have already stopped working. We hope that the remaining few workers will immediately come to their senses, make no unnecessary sacrifices, and do not become the enemy of all people. Stop working immediately and do not be greedy for petty profits, which will lead to unfortunate incidents. Workers, think twice."</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department's Letter to Workers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department's Civil Training Committee issued a letter to the French Water and Electricity Workers, the original text of which is as follows: "Dear French Water and Electricity Workers, this time you have been affected by the soaring prices and the high cost of living. You had to propose conditions to the capital to improve your treatment. This was originally a very reasonable and legitimate action. Unexpectedly, the French imperialist capitalists did not care and strictly refused. You had no choice but to resort to strike to promote the capital's awareness. Everyone knows that this strike was caused by the capital's coercion. Since the outbreak of the strike, it has been a month. Not only has the French imperialist capitalist not shown any signs of awareness, but he has intensified and dared to collude with the police to create the July 21st massacre of striking workers. The indignation of this association upon hearing the news has deepened. The outbreak of this massacre can be said to be a poisonous scheme pre-laid by the French imperialist capitalist. This association believes that the French imperialist capitalist must bear full responsibility for this tragedy. In addition to ordering the central government to instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seriously negotiate with the French leader and demand punishment and compensation, during this period of conspiracy and high-pressure massacre by the French imperialist capitalist, you should remain calm and continue to work hard with the revolutionary spirit of peaceful struggle, and you must seek a thorough victory. You must know that if imperialism is not overthrown, the Chinese nation and the people will always be in danger of death. To survive, we must thoroughly fight against the imperialist capitalists. Your ability to embrace the spirit of great fearlessness and to fight and mediate with it this time is a glorious page in the history of the labor movement. Workers, unite together, strictly guard against saboteurs, stand under the leadership of the Party, and fight the French imperialist capitalists to the death, so that the final victory will belong to us. We shout (1) Down with the French imperialists, (2) Down with the French imperialist capitalists, (3) The French Water and Electricity Workers' strike will be victorious, (4) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang."</p>
<p>Pudong Electrical Workers' Union Declaration</p>
<p>The Pudong Electrical Workers' Union issued a declaration of assistance to the Water and Electricity Workers, stating: "The French Water and Electricity Workers have been forced to strike for a long time. The factory's attitude is firm, refusing mediation by party and government agencies. The strike has expanded, and there is no date for resumption of work, resulting in the tragedy that occurred on Malong Road yesterday. Our association is heartbroken that the workers of the association were illegally trampled on by French imperialist capitalists. The righteousness of helping each other in the same boat does not allow us to sit idly by. It is our duty to put on our armor and go to the rescue. In addition to the voluntary fundraising and relief by the workers of this association, we hereby declare assistance and hope that all compatriots in the country will rise up together to avenge this strange shame. We urgently declare, and we are extremely indignant (omitted below)."</p>
<p>Postal Workers' Union Declaration</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union is the declaration for the French Concession tragedy: "(Omitted above) Compatriots, we feel boundless pain for this tragedy. We very much hope that compatriots from all walks of life will, on the one hand, provide practical assistance and action and jointly resist the atrocities of the French imperialists, and on the other hand, urge the government to raise serious negotiations, punish the murderers according to law, and actively strive to recover the concessions. This is a sincere declaration."</p>
<h3>Wusong Chamber of Commerce Visits Wounded Soldiers Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Songnan Zhanghuabang Wounded Soldiers Hospital has taken in more than 400 wounded officers and soldiers. The Wusong Chamber of Commerce specially raised more than 500 yuan and purchased biscuits, milk, fans, towels, and other items to comfort the wounded officers and soldiers in the hospital. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., Municipal Councilor Tang Chengzong, Chamber of Commerce President Zheng Dong, Anti-Smuggling First Brigade Captain Li Huchen, Representative Mao Zhong, Public Security Bureau Seventh District Chief Yang Maorong, Seventh District First Police Station Chief Zhang Jiguang, Dong Mengyi, and others personally went to the hospital to present comfort items. Jiang Renfu, the adjutant of the Songhu Garrison Command, and Gu's brother, the hospital director, warmly received them. After a brief rest, Jiang and Gu accompanied them to visit the dormitories of the wounded soldiers. The wounded soldiers had different injuries. Some had amputated arms and legs, while others had minor injuries to their heads, backs, and abdomens. All kinds of tragic situations were different. Director Jiang explained to the public that the Wusong Chamber of Commerce and all circles had come to the hospital to express their condolences and give gifts to connect with emotions. Upon hearing this, the wounded soldiers bowed their heads and stood in salute to express their gratitude. After the matter was completed, President Zheng bid farewell and returned.</p>
<h3>County Finance Bureau Public Notice Urgently Urging Land Registration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau issues a public notice: Regarding the matter of implementing land registration as ordered, with a deadline of six months, white paper notices have been drafted and distributed to various townships for posting in prominent places. At the same time, copies of regulations and procedures have been sent to each district office to establish sub-offices, earnestly advising and urging each household to register. Now, it has been five months since the commencement of the process, and despite repeated public notices and letters urging registration, property owners are still waiting and watching, and have not yet brought their deeds to the district to apply for registration, which is truly disrespectful. It must be known that the purpose of registration is to protect the property rights of the people. The fee is only ten cents per mu, which is very small, and significantly less than the verification fee charged during previous deed verifications. The burden on the people is still light, and it seems that the hardships of the people have been considered, so they should be happy to engage in it. Moreover, now that the green crops have matured and the harvest has increased, the small registration fee should not be difficult to pay. Furthermore, Article 4 of the promulgated registration regulations states that the registration period is fixed at six months. If registration is not completed after the deadline, those whose deeds have been verified will be charged fees, and those whose deeds have not been verified will be fined double. False reports and land exceeding the reported area during the survey will be confiscated. This bureau has already issued public notices to make this known to all. Now, the prescribed deadline is approaching in an instant, but property owners are still procrastinating and delaying registration, not only abandoning the protection of property rights, but also inviting trouble upon themselves by being fined after the deadline. You must quickly bring your deeds to the district to apply for registration and complete it within the deadline without delay. Those who apply for registration after the deadline will be punished according to regulations without any leniency. Therefore, another public notice is issued so that all property owners in the county are aware of this. This notice.</p>
<h3>County Finance Bureau Public Notice Announcing the Commencement of Busy Season Silver Tax Collection</h3>
<p>Wang, the director of the Shanghai County Finance Bureau, issued a public notice yesterday, stating: Regarding the matter of announcing the commencement of busy season silver tax collection, according to the case, the busy season silver tax of this county has been changed to be collected together starting from the 18th year, which has been submitted to the Finance Department for approval and is being handled accordingly. It is now decided to commence the collection of the 19th year's upper and lower busy season silver tax on the first day of the eighth month, with a deadline of two months to complete the payment. After the two-month deadline, a surcharge of 20% of the regular tax will be added. After another two-month deadline, a surcharge of 10% will be added. The upper busy season silver tax is one mace, one fen, four li, three hao, two si, seven hu per mu (completing one mace, one fen, five li, nine hao, seven si, nine hu for 8 mu and 7 fen). The lower busy season silver tax is one mace, one fen, five li, nine hao, seven si, nine hu per mu (completing one tael for 8 mu, 6 fen, two li, three hao). Each tael is converted to 2 yuan and 5 fen for regular and supplementary taxes, 1 jiao, 2 fen, 3 li for handling fees, 1 yuan and 4 jiao for education mu donation (1 jiao, 6 fen per mu) collected along with the tax, and 3 jiao, 5 fen for security corps donation (4 fen per mu). In total, each tael of busy season silver tax is converted to 3 yuan, 9 jiao, 2 fen, 3 li in silver dollars, and a total of 4 jiao, 4 fen, 8 li, 5 hao is collected per mu. In addition to ordering officials to distribute easily understandable forms according to the bao diagram, a public notice is hereby issued so that all property owners in the county are aware of this and pay the required amount into the treasury on time to obtain a receipt for peace of mind. Do not wait and delay, lest you incur pursuit and collection. Be sure to do this.</p>
<h3>French Envoy to China Announces Assumption of Duties</h3>
<p>Mr. Wilden, the new French envoy to China, after arriving in China, presenting his credentials, and holding a formal meeting with Mr. Wang Zheng, the head of our country, immediately proceeded to the embassy in Beiping to assume his duties. Yesterday, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a letter from the French Consulate in Shanghai, stating that Mr. Wilden formally assumed his duties in Beiping on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchant Ships Maintain River and Sea Transportation</h3>
<p>In the recent ten days, the river and sea vessels of Chinese merchants in Shanghai have again faced a situation of complete shutdown. Various shipping companies in this port have proposed discussions to maintain transportation and prevent foreign merchants from monopolizing shipping rights. The methods for maintaining navigation are listed below:</p>
<p>Maintaining Yangtze River Transportation: It has been found that ten days ago, most river vessels went to Changsha and Yueyang, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of Shanghai's upstream and downstream Yangtze River passenger ships. In order to implement the new agreement, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has made efforts to retain the three major ships, Jiangshun, Jiang'an, and Jianghua, for its own use, and continues to operate them on Mondays and Thursdays to meet the needs of passengers and merchants. The Jiangyu, Jiangjing, and Jianguo ships are on break according to the agreement. In addition, after the old Ningshao vessel of the Ningshao Company was suspended, the company repeatedly telegraphed Beijing to request the return of the Yongxing vessel in order to maintain Shanghai-Hankou transportation and avoid the entire good business being seized by foreign ships. Yesterday, a reply was received approving the return of the Yongxing vessel, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai in the next day or two and resume scheduled voyages.</p>
<p>Maintaining Ocean Transportation: Yesterday, various shipping companies formulated measures to maintain north-south ocean transportation. It is planned to retain one large vessel on the South China route to operate between Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong to supply goods and passengers, and one Xinfeng vessel on the North China route to operate between Yantai and Tianjin. Two vessels, Haiyan and Guangji, will be retained on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route to transport leveling rice and disaster relief rice. Currently, there are approximately ten Chinese merchant ships in total left on various river and sea routes to maintain transportation.</p>
<h3>Penalties for Unregistered Industrial and Commercial Businesses</h3>
<p>Social Bureau Strictly Enforces Laws</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Social Bureau began conducting industrial and commercial registration, the first and second phases have both exceeded the deadline. Many have complied with the regulations and registered, but there are also many who have delayed reporting. Yesterday, the bureau specifically listed the unregistered industrial and commercial businesses in the north and south of the city and sent letters to the Municipal Public Security Bureau requesting that they be summoned and punished. The original letter stated: "We hereby inform you that since this bureau began conducting industrial and commercial registration on December 1st of last year, we have handled the first phase of six industries, including old goods, sauce gardens, coal, silk fabrics, printing, and weights and measures, and the second phase of six industries, including bathhouses, barbershops, cooked food, southern goods, cloth, and bookbinding, and have sent letters to your bureau for investigation. Now, it has been found that the registration dates for both phases have long passed, and many have complied with the law and applied for registration, but there are still many who have not complied with the regulations and come to the bureau to register. We are sending herewith a list of unregistered households in the south city and Zhabei, 45 copies each, requesting that each district office punish them in accordance with Article 8 of the amended Industrial and Commercial Registration Regulations and order them to register with this bureau.</p>
<h3>Employees of Two Railways Approved for Additional Rice Subsidy of One Yuan</h3>
<p>Approved by the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Due to the rising cost of living and the high price of goods, employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways once requested rice subsidies from the authorities. It is now learned that workers with monthly salaries below 30 yuan have been approved by the Ministry of Railways to receive a temporary rice subsidy of one yuan per month. However, there are still no instructions for employees with monthly salaries between 30 yuan and 60 yuan. As for the newly promulgated salary increase regulations, it is hoped that they will not be implemented after the employees requested their cancellation.</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of the Labor Strike at the Ri Hua Cotton Mill in Pudong</h3>
<p>The workers in the fine yarn section of the Ri Hua Cotton Mill in Pudong, due to the high price of rice and the difficult living conditions, demanded that the management improve their treatment without success, resulting in the entire factory's workers going on strike one after another. The details have been briefly seen in yesterday's newspaper. Now, the cause, process, and party department's handling of the case are quite detailed, and the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Causes of the Strike: Since the current committee members of the Pudong Ri Hua Textile Workers' Union, Ni Yonglu, Ding Zhuo, Fei Wanqing, Zhang Hanhui, etc., took office, they have achieved nothing. They usually flatter the management and do not seek the slightest benefit for the workers. Therefore, all the factory workers resent them deeply. This year, the "May 1st" and "July 9th" memorial days are factory holidays stipulated by the National Government. If they do not rest, they must be paid double wages. However, the union did not stop work and did not strive for double wages from the management. On the 20th of this month, the workers in the fine yarn section of the Ri Hua Cotton Mill demanded improved living conditions and put forward three conditions, including increasing rice subsidies. The union ignored them, which further increased the resentment of all the factory workers, who requested that the higher authorities severely punish them.</p>
<p>Three Committee Members Detained and Interrogated: After receiving the complaint, the Civil Training Committee of the Municipal Party Department sent three union committee members, Zhang Hanhui, etc., to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for temporary detention on the previous day (the 21st) for punishment. After the news of the detention spread, the committee members who had not been detained were panicked and fled. Yesterday, the union's executive director, Ni Yonglu, was suddenly spotted by the factory workers, who were furious and immediately dragged him to the Fifth District Party Department and requested punishment. The District Party Department immediately took Ni Yonglu to the Municipal Party Department and transferred him to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for temporary detention.</p>
<p>Union Ordered to Suspend Activities: The Civil Training Committee of the Municipal Party Department, believing that the Ri Hua Workers' Union was being controlled by someone, neglecting union affairs, and flattering the management, causing public outrage, specially ordered the union to immediately suspend activities and await reorganization.</p>
<p>First Meeting of the Reorganization Committee: The committee also appointed Zhang Sheng, Zhang Guoxiang, Zhao Bi, and four others as members of the Ri Hua Workers' Union Reorganization Committee to organize the reorganization committee and engage in reorganization. It is heard that the reorganization committee held its first meeting yesterday to discuss several concrete measures and began to reorganize, in order to resolve the strike satisfactorily as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Union Support and Assistance: After the union committee members were detained, all the unions in Pudong were delighted. The Yingmei Xiang Sheng Loading and Unloading Union and other unions jointly petitioned the Municipal Civil Training Committee to demand that the detained committee members be severely punished as a warning to those who act as running dog committee members. It is heard that other unions will also unanimously request severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Police Must Buy Tickets for All Transportation</h3>
<p>Recent Circular from the Two Railway Police Departments</p>
<p>Previously, police and railway police officers could ride for free. Recently, Kong, the director of the two railway police departments, in view of the fact that police riding for free affects national revenue and that the priority of free tickets may cause police officers to leave their posts privately at any time, which would hinder official duties, specially issued a circular yesterday to the police officers and the traffic departments of each section stating that police and railway police officers must now purchase tickets in accordance with the regulations. If anyone rides without a ticket and does not have an official pass, they will be recorded and detained for submission to the relevant departments for handling.</p>
<h3>Fair Price Rice Sold for Only 400 Cash per Sheng</h3>
<p>The Municipal Rice Fair Price Committee, in view of the recent drop in the price of foreign rice and the lower exchange rate of copper coins, notified the distribution points in the city and townships a few days ago that the price per sheng would be reduced to 420 cash starting from the 20th of this month. Now, in order to benefit the common people, the price per sheng has been reduced by another two copper coins to 400 cash, and all distribution points in the city and townships have been notified to comply.</p>
<h3>Rice Shop Fined for Not Complying with Price Limit</h3>
<p>300 Yuan Used for Fair Price Rice Expenses</p>
<p>The Zhou Yitai Rice Shop in the south city sold five dou of high-grade white rice for 12 yuan on July 1st, exceeding the price limit of 2 yuan and 5 jiao set by the Social Bureau. Someone reported this to the bureau with an invoice. Yesterday, the Social Bureau summoned the owner of the shop. Considering that the shop's business is mainly miscellaneous grains, it imposed a lenient fine of 300 yuan to be used for fair price rice expenses to benefit the common people.</p>
<h3>Association of Families of Martyrs of the May 30th Incident</h3>
<p>Sixth Batch of Compensation Money to Be Issued</p>
<p>The Shanghai Association of Families of Martyrs of the May 30th Massacre, after issuing the fifth batch of compensation money to Wang Ruping, Zhou Renyun, and Shen Aqi, 500 yuan each, on the 12th of this month, still had comrades who had just registered and were injured, Mei Jinlin, Liu Shaoxian, Rui Chunting (Wei Chunting), Gu Dingjiang, Li Yixun, and Chen Yunqiu, whose investigation and guarantee procedures had not yet been completed. Therefore, it has been working actively in recent days. Chen Fucai, the representative of the association, personally investigated them separately. It is heard that Mei Zhonglin was a student of the Tongwen College before his death. During the May 30th incident, he was arrested and shot in the leg on Nanjing Road. He healed himself and returned to his hometown. In June of the 18th year, he died of illness. His father, Mei Baoji, now living at No. 2 Taining Street, Hankou, heard that compensation money could be claimed and specially entrusted his eldest daughter-in-law, Gong Pinjuan, to register with the association. A certificate of proof was also sent by Comrade Wu Kaixian, the standing committee member of the Municipal Party Department, to the Gong lady, who currently resides at No. 1 Heming Lane, Baxianqiao, French Concession of this city. Chen, the representative of the association, has already investigated her yesterday. It is heard that Gu Dingjiang, before his death, was a rickshaw puller at No. 258 Weishui Lane, Ningbo Road, and was injured in the foot by a stray bullet. He also died of illness in his hometown in August of last year. His father, Gu Bolang, came to Shanghai from Haimen to register with the association and obtained a written certificate from Dr. Cai. The remaining four people, Liu Shaoxian, Rui Chunting, Li Yixun, and Chen Yunqiu, all registered with the association in person. After the association's investigation confirmed the facts, it has issued receipts and guarantee forms and will issue the sixth batch of compensation money after the guarantee is completed. The association will then wind up its affairs and publish the account of the compensation money in the newspaper.</p>
<h3>Jishi Association Receives Information on the Disaster in Jingyang</h3>
<p>The China Jishi Association recently received a report from the Jingyang County Relief Branch in Shaanxi, stating that Jingyang is the focus of the famine in northern Wei, and has repeatedly appealed to various parties. Thanks to the government, the association, and various charitable organizations for providing relief, the disaster victims have been able to survive. Although the wheat harvest was slightly better, it was all irrigated with river channels and well water, accounting for only 4 or 5 percent. The rest of the land was not planted, leaving a barren red soil. Those who had wheat also suffered from wind damage, resulting in a sharp reduction in harvest. Furthermore, due to the urgent need for military rations, even a small amount of wheat was taken by the military, causing many people to flee. No one volunteered for conscription and had to be hired at a price. Coupled with the prevalence of natural disasters and the spread of epidemics, people were dying without medicine or food. Entire villages were dying out every day, which was particularly cruel. At the beginning of last month, there was a sudden rain of hail, damaging crops and cotton seedlings, making it difficult to expect a bumper harvest. Now, there is also an insect infestation, which is alarming. We beg the association to show compassion and save the world, think of the dying disaster victims, generously donate a large amount of relief supplies so that they can continue their lives. In this way, the 100,000 disaster victims will be grateful from the beginning and will not starve to death in the end. The living and the dead will be grateful beyond measure. The association previously provided relief in Shaanxi, and personnel were dispatched to Jingyang County, spending a lot of money. Now, the passes are blocked and the roads are interrupted, and the relief funds have been exhausted, making it difficult to go there. The association has provided relief from the beginning, how can it not be willing to provide relief to the end? However, due to the pressure of the situation, it is against our wishes. Looking west to northern Wei, there are no tears to shed, only helplessness to call out.</p>

<h3>Verdict on the Case of Indian National Sabulansin Accused</h3>
<p>The Da Wanbao reports that the case of Indian national Sabulansin, accused of distributing seditious leaflets on Jing'an Temple Road on the 29th of last month, was preliminarily tried by the British Police Court and transferred to the High Court of Justice. The trial was held this morning (the 22nd), and the Western police officer who arrested the defendant on that day testified to everything. After the interrogation, the jurors retired to deliberate for 15 minutes and declared the defendant guilty. The inquisitor then sentenced him to two months of imprisonment with hard labor and expulsion from the country upon completion of the sentence.</p>
<h3>Paint and Car Workers' Job Introduction Agency</h3>
<p>There are nearly 400 paint and car workers in this city, all of whom are scattered in all directions and have no organizational structure. Recently, the number of unemployed workers has been increasing daily.</p>
<p>The workers in this industry deeply feel the pain of unemployment. Therefore, representatives of workers from various firms were convened on the 21st of this month to discuss relief measures. Representatives of workers from more than 30 car firms, including Longfei and Quanchang, and more than 230 workers attended. Yu Shengbao was elected as chairman to discuss the following matters: (1) Establish a workers' job introduction agency; (2) Notify unemployed workers in this city to register in the newspaper; (3) Temporarily borrow the Junji Lane on Xinjiang Road in Zhabei as the agency's address.</p>

<h3>Strange Kidnapping Case Occurs Outside of Wusong Estuary</h3>
<p>Water Police Inspector Turns Out To Be Kidnapper</p>
<p>Whereabouts of Five Hostages Unknown</p>
<p>A police patrol boat has been stationed off the coast of Ruifengsha in Wusong Estuary, commanded by Inspector Zhang of the 17th Team of the 4th District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Force, with a total of eight water police officers. At approximately 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, five men wearing uniforms, carrying guns, and resembling soldiers suddenly visited Inspector Zhang. The two sides whispered to each other for a long time. Zhang immediately prepared refreshments and treated them warmly. After they finished eating, Inspector Zhang immediately led five water police officers, all armed, first confiscated the guns of the other three police officers, confined them to a room, and then, at approximately 7:00 PM, took a civil boat with the five visitors, crossed to Dingxingsha, not far away, landed, and went straight to the home of Wang Buyun, the head of the village. Wang had just returned home from outside and saw Zhang and others visiting. Because he had known Zhang for a long time, he treated them courteously. Unexpectedly, at this time, they suddenly stood up, surrounded Wang Buyun, pulled out their pistols, and warned him not to make a sound. They dragged him out the door. At this time, Wang's second son, who was in the inner room, saw the situation, ran out, and shouted for help, so he was also taken away. Wang's family members did not dare to make a sound. Wang and his son were then tied into the boat. Seeing that they were all armed, they did not dare to resist. Inspector Zhang and others then sailed to Yawosha (i.e., Shitousha), landed, and kidnapped three farmers from that area, surnamed Shi and Qian, using the same method, and tied them into the boat. They immediately set sail and sped away to the ocean. Wang Buyun is 45 years old and has three sons. His eldest son, Fusheng, is 18 years old, and his second son, Daosheng, is 13 years old (who was also kidnapped). Wang is highly respected in the area. Even people in this city know his name. His family has 70 mu of ancestral farmland. Usually, his whole family works hard in farming. Although their situation is not bad, it is not considered good. Wang is quite kind and has no enemies. Before the incident, he had not received any threatening letters. After the incident, Wang's family members did not initially know that it was Inspector Zhang and others who did it. They all sent people to the Ruifengsha boat to report to the water police to pursue the matter. At that time, the three water police officers who had been disarmed understood the situation and immediately reported the information to Gong Jinqin, the captain of the 17th Team, yesterday. Captain Gong had been suppressing bandits in the Chongqi area of the ocean recently. After receiving the news, he was very angry and had already ordered his subordinate teams to find a way to arrest Inspector Zhang and others and rescue the kidnapped hostages. He also sent a telegram to the 4th District Department yesterday afternoon, ordering all subordinate teams to strictly investigate and arrest Inspector Zhang and others and bring them to justice. However, there has been no news of danger for the kidnapped Wang Buyun and his son and the three Shi and Qian hostages as of last night.</p>
<h3>Lu Genrong Released</h3>
<p>Paid 50 Yuan Bail</p>
<p>Freedom Restored Yesterday</p>
<p>Lu Genrong, of the master-servant love affair, was acquitted of the part of helping theft after a retrial by the High Court. Because the prosecutor, Jin Henian, disagreed with the verdict, he appealed to the Supreme Court, causing him to be unable to be released from prison. A few days ago, the acting defense lawyer, Song Mingxun, specially submitted a written request to the Criminal Division of the High Court, requesting a stay of detention. The presiding judge of the Third Criminal Division of the original trial, Zhao Zheng, judges Zheng Zhiguo and Fang Wen, reviewed it, and yesterday (the 22nd) ruled that he be allowed to pay 50 yuan bail for a stay of detention. The ruling was delivered to Lu Genrong that day. The text of the ruling is as follows: Criminal Ruling of the Jiangsu High Court, No. 52, Miscellaneous Character, 19th year of the Republic.

<h3>Professor of Jinan University Falsely Accused of Plotting to Kill His Wife</h3>
<p>In Fact, She Died of Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Wife's Mother Accuses Due to Grief</p>
<p>Defendant Has People to Testify</p>
<p>Trial Will Dismiss Charges</p>
<p>Xie Wuheng, a professor at Jinan University in Zhenru, residing at No. 82 Chenghu Village, Foch Road, French Concession, previously married Sun Huizhu, the daughter of Sun Cao. After she entered the family, Huizhu often fell ill and died suddenly on the 11th of this month. Unexpectedly, the wife's mother, Cao, reported to the French Police Station that her daughter was plotted to be killed by her son-in-law in collusion with a doctor, committing the crime of murder, and requested an investigation. The police chief approved the request and summoned both parties to the French Court's Criminal Division for questioning yesterday. The plaintiff, Sun Cao, stated that her daughter fell ill shortly after marrying Xie. Although her son-in-law hired doctors to treat her, her condition suddenly improved and worsened. Last month, her son-in-law suddenly advised her daughter not to take medicine anymore. However, the woman believed that her daughter's condition was dangerous, and the medicine could not be stopped. Therefore, the woman insisted on hiring doctors and taking medicine, and the woman served her by her side. On the 11th of this month, the son-in-law and several doctors whispered in the room, and then gave my daughter an injection. Unexpectedly, my daughter died two hours later, with no way to revive her. At that time, she was in grief and cried all night. However, even though her daughter was ill, she only needed to let her die of her own illness. The defendant should not have conspired with doctors to give her an injection to death. Therefore, the woman was very unwilling and filed a complaint. The defendant, Xie Wuheng, represented by lawyer Tibek, argued that the defendant's wife actually died of tuberculosis and could not be saved. There are witnesses on file to prove this. The murder charge brought by the plaintiff is related to the defendant's reputation. He requested a clear investigation and rejection and permission to file a counterclaim for damages, etc. Then, the doctor appeared in court and testified that the deceased actually suffered from tuberculosis and died after I treated her for several months without success. As for the medicine injection given by the doctor, it had nothing to do with the disease. Witnesses Zhang Jiang and others also appeared in court to testify that the deceased actually died of illness. Judge Zhu reviewed the statement and ruled that the plaintiff's daughter's death was proven to be due to illness, and the charge was false and should be dismissed immediately.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Romantic Fiasco Between a Leather Merchant and a Young Woman</h3>
<p>In the beginning, they were exceedingly intimate and affectionate;</p>
<p>After a long time, they ended up hating each other.</p>
<p>Wang Shenzhai's crime of enticing a woman by persuasion:</p>
<p>Sentenced to one year of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Wang Shenzhai, from Tianjin, was in the leather trade and resided at the Yi Xin Hotel, No. 507 Henan Road. Last August, Wang went to Jiaxing to collect leather and stayed there for several days. Although he had a close friend named Shi in He City, he did not want to stay at Shi's house, so he stayed at a hotel. Shi, wanting to alleviate his old friend's loneliness, introduced a young woman of twenty-nine years of age to accompany him. According to the woman, her name was Wang A'ou, and her father ran a noodle shop in the city. Wang found the woman's appearance quite beautiful, truly a girl from a modest family, and was very delighted, regretting that they had not met sooner. He worried about not being able to stay together for long, so he asked her to come to Shanghai with him, saying that he was still unmarried and if she was willing to follow him, he would formally marry her after arriving in Shanghai so that they could live together forever, without separating halfway. The woman believed that Wang's words came from his heart and agreed. Fearing that her parents would object if she told them, she eloped with Wang like Wen Jun and went to Shanghai, staying temporarily at the hotel. Unexpectedly, not long after they lived together, Wang's affection gradually faded, and he even scolded and beat her frequently. At this time, the woman learned that Wang had a wife whom he had abandoned in Tianjin. On April 2 of this year, the woman could no longer bear the abuse and secretly left the hotel, taking a car back to He. After arriving in her hometown, she felt ashamed to face her parents because she had met the wrong person. She went alone to the Xin Yang Bridge in the East Gate of Jiaxing to commit suicide by jumping into the river. The water police stationed there spotted her and rescued her, allowing her to live again. The woman still hoped that Wang would change his mind, so she came to Shanghai to follow him again. Initially, they managed to get along well, but after a long time, Wang's old habits resurfaced, and the woman had to write a letter to her mother, Wang Yu, asking for help. Mrs. Wang brought her son, Wang Jinwen, to Shanghai a few days ago and reported to the Old Gate Police Station, which dispatched Detective Cui Chengke to arrest Wang Shenzhai at the Yi Xin Hotel. Then, they went to Room 16 of the Jia He Hotel at No. 653 Fujian Road and took Wang A'ou out. They then transferred them to the Special District Local Court, which ordered the defendant to post a bail of 1,000 yuan pending trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Jiashi opened the trial. The plaintiff explained the past situation, while the police lawyer stated that the defendant had committed a crime under Article 257 of the Criminal Code and requested punishment. When questioned, the defendant Wang Shenzhai claimed that the woman had followed him willingly and that he had not enticed her by abduction, etc. He also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him, saying that the plaintiff was originally a romantic woman who had previously been involved with Shen Jin. Later, Shen broke up with her because he could not afford her demands, and now the defendant had turned against her because he could not afford her demands either. Upon hearing this, the plaintiff vehemently denied ever having been involved with Shen and also hired lawyer Ye Fukang to defend her. Judge Xu reviewed the testimonies and sentenced the defendant to one year of imprisonment for intending to seduce and entice a woman under the age of twenty. However, the defendant stated that he would appeal.</p>
<h3>A New Hurricane Reaches the Philippines</h3>
<p>If It Does Not Change Direction,</p>
<p>It Will Still Reach China</p>
<p>The new hurricane in the Pacific Ocean is moving faster than in the past few days, and its direction has not changed much. According to the report from the Yangjingbang Observatory at 5:00 PM yesterday, it has reached the northern part of the Philippine Islands. Its range has not decreased since it was first discovered. If it does not change direction, it will reach China via Taiwan.</p>
<h3>The Defense of the Public Concession is More Serious Than Before</h3>
<p>From six to seven in the morning,</p>
<p>Detectives are dispatched for inspection.</p>
<p>The police authorities of the Public Concession have recently paid great attention to the defense within the concession, instructing all police stations and heads to strictly order Chinese and foreign detectives to strengthen their vigilance and dispatch a large number of plainclothes officers to search everywhere. All bridges and important roads have detectives who must inspect passing trams, cars, and other vehicles and pedestrians one by one to prevent those carrying contraband from mixing into the concession. However, this inspection time used to be mostly in the evening or at night, but recently, plainclothes officers led by Western officers have been dispatched at six to seven in the morning to conduct inspections in areas with heavier traffic. In addition to this, detectives are still searching at any time and any place to prevent bandits from hiding and to maintain public order.</p>
<h3>Tong Sanmao's Defense Statement in the Huang Baiying Case</h3>
<p>Regarding the sensational case of the dancer Huang Baiying committing suicide by taking poison, which has attracted widespread attention, the Shanghai Special District Local Court has held three trials and concluded the debate. The verdict will be announced on the 23rd of this month (today). It is reported that the defendant Tong Sanmao has submitted a defense statement through his attorneys Liu Shifang and Zou Yu. The statement is very long, and we have obtained a copy, which is transcribed below:</p>
<p>The defendant, Tong Wenbo (i.e., Tong Sanmao), is in custody and has appointed attorneys Liu Shifang and Zou Yu, No. 24A, The Bund, Attorney No. 9, to defend him in the matter of being accused of inciting and assisting suicide, in accordance with the law. The defendant has always been law-abiding and helped his father manage the store. Unfortunately, last year, he occasionally met Baiying in a dance hall, and after a few days, they made a marriage agreement. Fearing his strict father's opposition, he was unable to fulfill the agreement sooner. However, Baiying repeatedly vowed that she would never change her mind. At that time, the defendant also believed that Baiying's background had been through many hardships, and once she realized her mistakes, she would be trustworthy. Therefore, he tried his best to repay her, spending a lot of money. However, because he lingered day and night, forgetting to return, and was too absurd, he was despised by his family, and his father cut off his financial support. However, the defendant was so passionate at the time that, although he felt ashamed of his empty wallet, he borrowed money to live on but never mistreated Baiying. Baiying also got along well with him. A week before this case occurred, they even lived together at the Da Dong Hotel for several days. Later, the defendant suddenly discovered that Baiying had another lover and was living with him in a rented house somewhere in the French Concession. At that time, although the defendant hated Baiying's heartlessness, he also knew that the dance halls on the sea were nominally high-class entertainment, but many of the dancers were actually prostitutes. He could only blame himself. On the 28th of last month, after drinking, he went to the Paris dance hall again and saw Baiying at the same table as Fang Hengnian. With Fang's consent, he danced with Baiying. The defendant's actions were entirely reckless and intoxicated (he was actually very drunk at the time, as evidenced by the signature slip), and he had no other intentions. Unexpectedly, Fang Hengnian, knowing that Baiying had another lover and being aware of Baiying's relationship with the defendant, fearing that the defendant would harbor resentment or make things difficult for Baiying, insisted on inviting Baiying and the defendant to return home in the same car to mediate. Fang Hengnian called a car and they sat together for a ride. At that time, the defendant, feeling the pressure of his debts, asked Baiying to return home with him. Baiying's father stated that all the past events were due to Baiying's seduction and that the defendant was unable to return home because of her, although it was his own fault. In the end, he agreed. At that time, Fang Hengnian, seeing that there was no conflict between them, got out of the car first. However, it was too early to visit the father, so they went to Wusong for a trip. Unexpectedly, on the way, Baiying suddenly said that because of her, the defendant had suffered great sacrifices and that she felt extremely uneasy about her actions. She wished to die as an apology. The defendant, hearing her words, thought that she had found her conscience. At the same time, he was threatened by creditors, rejected by his family, and had no interest in life. He agreed with her and wished to die together. After arriving at the beach, he suddenly remembered that he was very good at swimming, while Baiying was also able to swim a little, but throwing herself into the raging waves would definitely lead to death. He feared that she would be afraid of death when facing difficulties and would let her down, so he stopped her from throwing herself into the sea. At that time, Baiying proposed to take sleeping pills together, so they returned to Shanghai to plan their mutual death. When the car passed Avenue Petain, because he had no money, he borrowed 30 yuan from a friend. At this time, Baiying scolded him for not doing this, saying that what she had was enough. At about 8:20, when the car passed the Central Pharmacy (at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Zhao Feng Road), Baiying instructed him to buy sleeping pills and said that she had bought them in Guangdong before. The defendant asked the pharmacy as instructed, and the owner gave him Midinga sleeping pills. He immediately took them to the car and asked Baiying if it was this medicine. She replied yes and gave him one yuan to pay for the medicine. Then they went to the Cangzhou Hotel and opened room 201 to plan to take the medicine together, which was about 9 o'clock. Because they had already made up their minds to die and had nothing to love in the world, they had no last words and wanted to die early. He ordered the waiter to bring four bottles of lemonade for them to swallow the medicine. But Baiying suddenly said that she wanted to leave a few words, so she called the waiter to bring letter paper and envelopes. Baiying scribbled arbitrarily on the paper but did not write anything. Then the defendant poured the medicine on the table, and Baiying took half of it first. When the defendant took the medicine, Baiying suddenly refused to let him take it, saying that the defendant did not need to die. But the defendant had already made up his mind to die and had no place to stay, so he still went to the window sill and opened the soda bottle cap. But when he turned around, he lost the medicine, not knowing whether Baiying had taken it or thrown it away. The defendant saw that he could not die and saw that Baiying was willing to die for him, which proved that she loved him. At that time, he only hated that his financial resources were insufficient and could not marry her sooner. At that critical moment, between life and breath, he quickly called the waiter to call a car to take her to the hospital. It was about 9:10. Then, because he waited for a long time, he hired a passing car at the door and sent her directly to the hospital. It was about 9:40 when he arrived at the hospital. He immediately went to the emergency room for treatment. Baiying told the doctor that she had taken sleeping pills. At that time, because he believed that Baiying still loved him and that the medicine she had taken would not harm her, Baiying was able to explain everything to the doctor in person, which proved that she was in a clear state of mind. Moreover, she was already in the hospital, and there was no need to worry about her life. For the sake of their future reputation, he temporarily fabricated Baiying's and his address and name. At that time, a Chinese detective from the police station happened to be at the hospital and went to the police station with him and was released. Fearing that the police station would prosecute, he surrendered to the Xin Zha Police Station the next day. This is the fact of what happened. I will now discuss this case in detail as follows: (A) Whether it is attempted incitement to suicide. The police station is prosecuting him for the crime of attempted incitement or assistance to others to commit suicide under Article 290, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code. Let us first discuss incitement to suicide. The method of inciting suicide is indeed as the police lawyer stated, including temptation and coercion. According to the police station's prosecution, the nature of incitement to suicide in this case is coercion, which is based entirely on Baiying's statement. (1) It is said that when Fang Hengnian, Huang Baiying, and the defendant were riding in a car to Beixinjing, the defendant showed a checkbook, saying that there was an item for purchasing a handgun for killing Baiying. When the three were in the car, Baiying was in the middle, and Fang Hengnian and the defendant were sitting on either side of Baiying. If he showed the checkbook to intimidate her, Fang Hengnian would definitely have heard it. However, when Fang Hengnian testified in court, he said that he only saw a small book and did not hear the defendant say the intimidating words that Baiying claimed, which proves Baiying's lie. (2) Baiying said that when they were on the way to Wusong, the defendant said, "If you don't die, two or three people will die later." Therefore, Baiying would rather sacrifice her own life than bring disaster to the innocent. There is no evidence for this kind of statement, and Baiying can fabricate it at will. Its lack of credibility can be seen even more by setting it aside. When the defendant went to Wusong, he had already regretted it.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Therefore, he invited Baiying to return home, stating the previous falsehood. At that time, although he was uneasy and feared that his father would not allow it, in a moment, considering human nature, there was no reason to force Baiying to kill him. During the court hearing, although Fang Hengnian proved that the defendant did invite Baiying to return home, Baiying denied it, which proves that her words were all false. (3) When they arrived at the Wusong Gorge by the water, the raging waves were surging. They originally planned to jump into the sea together, but suddenly remembered that the defendant was very good at swimming, fearing that he would be afraid of death when facing difficulties and would let her down, so he stopped her from throwing herself into the sea. Unexpectedly, Baiying said that the defendant knew she could swim, so he devised another method to cause her death. Baiying regards swimming as a kind of game. Every time she swims, she needs the defendant to support her, and she often runs out of energy and gasps for breath after swimming less than ten feet. Who can believe that she can escape alive by throwing herself into the raging waves? Even if the defendant really wanted to force Baiying to death, fearing that she would not die by throwing herself into the sea, he would definitely want to kill her. Know that survival is human nature. Unless there is no other choice, people are willing to commit suicide. Every time in a dangerous situation, they will make a final struggle. Baiying is truly willing to commit suicide to save others, but the defendant would never be so calm and unhurried, taking her back to Shanghai for several hours, without worrying that Baiying would shout for help halfway. This further proves that it was a mutual suicide, and it can also prove that the matter was proposed by Baiying, so that the defendant can deeply believe that there will be no change halfway. (4) Baiying said that at the Cangzhou Hotel, she voluntarily took the medicine entirely because the defendant said, "If you don't die, two or three people will die later." Therefore, she would rather sacrifice her own life and said that after taking the medicine, she stood at the window, hoping that acquaintances would pass by to rescue her. Baiying's intention was nothing more than to prove that Baiying's taking the medicine was entirely under coercion. As the defendant said, except for being in a desperate situation, people are willing to commit suicide. No one is not afraid of death. Therefore, Baiying's standing at the window and hoping for rescue is very reasonable at first hearing, but a close examination of her words shows a clear contradiction. If Baiying did not want to commit suicide, there were many opportunities to ask for help (details below). Why didn't she escape before, but wanted to seek help after taking the medicine? It is clearly that she knew after this incident that she would no longer be tolerated by her family and would have no place to stand. In order to please Zhang, she did not hesitate to fabricate accusations to show her love for Zhang and was willing to sacrifice her own life to seek peace for Zhang in the future. Her heart is so venomous that it is extremely infuriating. (5) According to Baiying's statement, when they were in Wusong, the defendant had already intended to force her to death. When buying medicine, the driver volunteered to report to the police, and there was a Chinese policeman standing in front of the pharmacy, less than ten feet away. Why didn't she call the police? Moreover, when buying medicine, Baiying herself admitted that she first asked the name of the medicine inside and then came out and gave one yuan to pay for the medicine. Who can believe that it was a forced killing? (6) According to the driver and the Cangzhou Hotel waiter, the defendant and Baiying did not quarrel at all, and said that the situation was very intimate. Asking to die together, if it were not proposed by Baiying, how could Baiying be able to die without any dispute, just by the defendant's words (referring to Baiying's false accusation that the defendant had said to her, "If you don't die, two or three people will die later")? Moreover, she was still very intimate with the defendant and went to death alone. The matter is very unreasonable and obvious. (7) Baiying said that she had written a will and placed it on the table in the room, but later it disappeared. According to the police lawyer, since there was a will, there must be someone to deliver the letter, and the sender must be the defendant. This proves that the defendant did not intend to die together. Baiying and the defendant stayed at the Cangzhou Hotel for only ten minutes, and they were both very confused and could not possibly write a letter. Therefore, at that time, only Baiying's scribbling was seen, and there was no so-called will. Even if there was a will, according to Baiying's own statement, it was not handed over to the defendant. Moreover, the will of the suicide does not always have someone to deliver it. Why can we immediately point out the defendant as the sender? However, according to what the defendant knows, the Xin Zha Police Station has Baiying's name on the letterhead of the Cangzhou Hotel. The so-called will may refer to this. The court should suspend the paper for investigation to clarify the truth. "B" According to incitement to suicide, it is nothing more than temptation and coercion. It can now be considered that the inciter refers to coercion. To summarize the above points, there is no establishment of coercion. Let us discuss the second point. The defendant's behavior is actually assisting suicide in the name of conspiracy for suicide. I will also discuss it separately as follows: (1) Many people know the relationship between Baiying and the defendant. Now that Baiying is unfaithful, others suspect that the defendant may make things difficult for Baiying. Therefore, on the evening of the 28th, when the defendant went to the Paris dance hall, Fang Hengnian intended to be a mediator, saying that Baiying died suddenly in the hotel on the 29th. If Fang Hengnian proves the events of the night, the defendant will be difficult to escape the law. Moreover, many people at the Paris dance hall personally saw Baiying, Fang Hengnian, and the defendant leaving together that night, and the bill for the car fare and the account book of the Cangzhou Hotel were all signed by the defendant. If there was no intention to die together, the means of the murder would not be so stupid. (2) According to the car driver and the Cangzhou Hotel waiter, there was no quarrel between the defendant and Baiying, and they said that the situation was very intimate. Asking to die together, if it were not proposed by Baiying, how could Baiying be able to die without any argument, just by the defendant's words (referring to Baiying falsely accusing the defendant of saying to her, "If you don't die, two or three people will die later")? Moreover, she was still very intimate with the defendant and went to death alone. The matter is very unreasonable and obvious. (3) When arriving at the Cangzhou Hotel, it was about 9 o'clock. At that time, because they had been sitting in the car for several hours and it was quite cold after a sunny morning, there was no reason to drink soda again. It would be enough to drink one bottle of water, but the reason for wanting four bottles was nothing more than for the two to take medicine. This further proves that they were indeed planning to die together at that time. (4) After Baiying took five tablets first, the remaining pills suddenly disappeared after the defendant opened the soda. The defendant, seeing that he could not die, immediately sent Baiying to the hospital. If the defendant intended to kill Baiying, why would he send her to the hospital again? Moreover, it was only ten minutes in the room, which proves that the defendant did not intend to let Baiying die alone. As for the police lawyer's claim in court that if the defendant really had the intention to commit suicide, why didn't he buy another one? This argument proves that the lawyer has no common sense. It should be known that the Cangzhou Hotel is located on Jing'an Temple Road, and there is no pharmacy nearby. Even if there is a pharmacy, it may not necessarily have this medicine. Even if it has this medicine, it may not necessarily be willing to sell it. The defendant could not bear Baiying to die alone at that time, and he could not find a way to die. Therefore, the only way out was to save Baiying's life. As for changing the name and surname after arriving at the hospital, it was entirely because Baiying was still in a clear state of mind when she arrived at the hospital, and sleeping pills are not acute poisons, so there was no fear of her life. Leaving her real name would only be a handle for others, so it is better to change her name to Tang Agou when she committed suicide. As for Baiying's current denial of planning to die together, it is entirely for the sake of her recent lover, Zhang. It can only be forgiven by Zhang if she is forced. Moreover, since the defendant has fallen since then, he is not tolerated by his family and is economically tight. He cannot be favored by Baiying. Baiying even falsely accused the defendant of forcing her to commit suicide, but according to the facts and the testimony of witnesses, who can believe it? Now the police lawyer is prosecuting him for the crime of attempted incitement and assistance to others to commit suicide under Article 290, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code. According to the defendant's actions, this article cannot be applied at all. Because the defendant and Baiying planned to die together and stopped. At most, he can be charged with the crime of Article 290, paragraph 3. However, this item is that both parties planned to die together, and the one who did not die is exempted from punishment. According to this article, even if the other party who planned to die together is dead, he is still exempted from punishment. Because those who planned to kill together are mostly worthy of pity. Therefore, the law has this special provision. Now, Baiying is not only not dead, but also saved by the defendant. Moreover, the occurrence of this case is the result of a cunning dancer playing with a young man with a weak will, and it happened after drinking, so he did not consider the importance of the matter and rashly bought medicine pills. Therefore, if the court believes that the defendant's actions should be punished, please also apply the provisions of Articles 32, 41, 77, and 290, paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code and allow him to be exempted from punishment or allow probation according to the provisions of Article 90 of the Criminal Code. To summarize the above points, please investigate the facts and laws and pronounce him innocent. It is really convenient. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Local Court, the petitioner Tong Wenbo (i.e., Tong Sanmao), appointed lawyers Liu Shifang, Zou Yu, July 21, Republic of China 19 years.</p>

<h3>Li Zhonghua Accused</h3>
<p>A Suspected Extortion Case to be Judged</p>
<p>Silk merchant Chen Liangsheng, having repeatedly received threatening letters demanding a ransom of six hundred dollars, specifying that the silver dollars be left at the front of the Zhen De Elementary School red wooden shop on Xiaonanmen Xiaozha Bridge, and contact be made through the newspaper shop there. Chen then reported it to the seventh team of the security corps, led by team leader Ma Wenda, who assigned platoon leader Jin Shunchang and members Gu Guoan, etc., to go undercover to make an arrest. Soon, a Hebei man, Li Zhonghua, arrived, placing a newspaper on the red wood. Jin, Gu, and others immediately came out to arrest him. Li fled, raising his hand, and was subsequently shot, wounding his wrist. After being sent to the hospital for treatment, Li then went to the local court to accuse Jin, Gu, and others of attempted murder. After the security corps requested the Party headquarters to investigate, it was found that Li Zhonghua was engaged in usury, severely exploiting others, and four ledgers were seized, serving as evidence of his usury. The handwriting in them matched the threatening letters. Therefore, the security corps members were declared innocent, and Li Zhonghua was instead taken into custody. After the investigation was completed, Li Zhonghua was prosecuted for being a local tyrant and evil gentry engaged in usury and extortion. Yesterday, presiding judge Shen Bingrong opened the court for trial. The defendant Li Zhonghua testified, stating that he was thirty-seven years old, from Hebei, residing at No. 37 Tangfang Lane. He used to be a policeman and is now a construction worker. He said, "I was passing by Xiaozha Bridge on April 21st of this year and saw a newspaper, half on the ground and half on the red wood. Seeing it was complete, I placed the newspaper properly, intending to take it back to wrap copper coins. Unexpectedly, one person from the security corps grabbed my left hand, another grabbed my right hand, and then they shot me. The interest I charge is two percent. That day, I went to the Shen surname store at Licang Bridge Wangji Wash Brush Lane to collect one thousand cash in interest from Fang Jisheng. I cannot write. I know nothing about the threatening letters." The judge asked, "Why did you go to the red wood to place the newspaper?" He replied, "I didn't know the contents." The judge asked, "How could it be such a coincidence? Tell me clearly how you engage in usury." He replied, "It's really two percent." The judge asked, "What is the interest on ten dollars?" He replied, "Some are two dimes in small dollars, some are two dimes in big dollars." The judge asked, "The bureau initially considered you a victim, so how is it that you are now being detained? It is evident that this case can no longer be concealed. Tell the truth about how you wrote the threatening letters and engaged in usury." The defendant continued to give the same testimony as before. The judge said, "According to your statement, the monthly interest on a ten-dollar loan is two dimes in big dollars, which calculates to 2.4 percent per year. You must know that the National Government stipulates that interest rates cannot exceed 20 percent per annum. You have definitely broken the law." At this point, Chen Liangsheng was asked to testify. He stated that he was forty years old, from Shanghai, residing in Zhaojiawan. On April 7th, 12th, and 21st, he received three letters in succession, so he reported it to the security corps. He did not know the details of the arrest at the time. Later, he was notified to go to the district to testify. On the way, he was told that the district would not accept it, so he returned. He did not recognize Li Zhonghua. The threatening letters had no name, only a surname, but the street name and house number were completely correct, and so on. Kang Jiabao testified that he was forty years old, from Nanhui, residing at No. 30 Wash Brush Lane, working as a tailor. In late March, he borrowed 15,000 cash from Li Zhonghua, repaying 330 cash daily, to be repaid in two months, for a total of 19,800 cash. He was almost finished repaying it. He borrowed another 10,000 cash, repaying 220 cash daily, also to be repaid in two months, for a total of 13,200 cash. He then pointed to Li, saying he borrowed from him. The judge then questioned Li Zhonghua, who said he did not recognize him. The judge admonished Kang Jiabao, saying, "Why squander the money you earn from your handicraft work on such high interest? Don't borrow again next time. You must know that the more you borrow, the poorer you become." Kang agreed. Gao Fuxing testified that he was forty-one years old, from Taicang, residing at No. 73 Zhaojiawan, working as a tailor. Last October, he borrowed ten dollars from him, recorded as 30,000 cash in the ledger, repaying 660 cash daily, to be repaid in two months, for a total of 39,600 cash, and so on. Ma Wenda testified that he was thirty-three years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 9 Xinsheng Lane, Xiaonanmen, and was the leader of the security corps. After Chen Liangsheng reported the matter, he instructed platoon leader Jin Shunchang to take six corps members to make an undercover arrest. Because Li Zhonghua's actions matched the description in the letters, he was arrested. He immediately raised his hand, which was suspected to be a pistol, so a shot was fired. The usury ledgers were obtained by us after investigation, upon requesting the Party headquarters, and so on. Peng Rongquan testified that he was thirty-six years old and a corps member. He went there on April 21st. He was not clear about the arrest situation because he was at the intersection. At this point, prosecutor Xu Heling was invited to the court to present his opinion, stating that the usury and threatening letters in this case, with the ledgers as evidence, were very clear upon comparison. He requested a judgment in accordance with the law. The presiding judge then announced the end of the debate and scheduled a sentencing date. Li Zhonghua was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Old Man Loses Life Crying for Grandson</h3>
<p>Rushing to Son's House</p>
<p>Killed by Car</p>
<p>Jiangbei elder Zhou Changfu, the day before yesterday at noon, was having lunch at his youngest son's house on South Railway Station Road when he heard a child crying at his eldest son's house. Moved by his affection for his grandson, he stopped eating and rushed to his eldest son's place. While walking in front of the Local Court, he was struck and run over by a car driven by Yang Mingfu, causing serious injuries. A patrol officer arrived, apprehended Yang, and took him and the injured man to the Local Court. After examination by prosecutor Zhao, Zhou was sent to Xin Puyu Hall for treatment, while Yang was detained. However, Zhou's injuries were severe, and he died in the afternoon. Yesterday, the family of the deceased took the body to the court to request an autopsy. After the examination, they were instructed to make arrangements for burial. Unexpectedly, the three sons were unable to afford a coffin, so the court ordered the local security to report to the hall for a coffin to be provided for burial.</p>
<h3>Danger of Children Crossing the Road</h3>
<p>Child Killed by Car</p>
<p>Yesterday evening at 6:30 PM, three or five children were loitering on the side of Nanjing Road Bund. One child, about eleven or twelve years old, with a shaved head, wearing a white lawn shirt and pants, attempted to cross the road. A car, license number 7248, approached head-on, and the child, unable to avoid it, was knocked to the ground, his head crushed. Officer No. 621 arrived at the scene, recorded the car number, and sent the injured child to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of the injuries, the child died in the hospital in a little over a quarter of an hour.</p>
<h3>Trial of the Pujiang Robbery Case</h3>
<p>On the morning of May 30th, the Junpu Bureau's foreign engineer, an Englishman named Hart, and others, escorted 20,000 dollars in cash on the Lifly steamboat to Yangshupu to pay workers' wages. Suddenly, a gang of bandits, in a small boat, intercepted the boat and robbed it, firing shots that killed and wounded several people. They then looted the money and fled. Subsequently, the police successively apprehended several suspects, who were transferred to the Shanghai Local Court to await trial. There are currently three people detained at the Laozha Police Station: Zhang Genbao, Yao Zucheng, Feng Qing, and others. The ringleader, Zhang Along, fled to Singapore after the crime, and the police sent detectives to Singapore to extradite him, but he has not yet been returned. Therefore, the case has not been able to proceed. The police investigation procedures are now complete, but unwilling to let the matter drag on indefinitely due to the lack of news from those going to Singapore, they transferred Zhang and the other two to the Special District Local Court yesterday morning. Presiding judge Xu Jiashi conducted the interrogation. A detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Gao Wansheng, appeared in court, requesting the transfer. Judge Xu stated that the case had already been transferred by the Shanghai Local Court and that he had already agreed to the transfer, so it was not appropriate to hand them over to the Public Security Bureau again. He ordered Zhang Genbao and the other two to be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. Subsequently, the police lawyer Gan Jingxian stated that everything confiscated from the home of ringleader Zhang Along at No. 750 Weihaiwei Road should be disposed of. Judge Xu also instructed that they be temporarily retained at the police station to await disposition.</p>
<h3>Strange Affair of Seven People Conferring Secretly</h3>
<p>At the Jinyuanyuan Sand Boat Workshop</p>
<p>Many Contradictions in Each Individual's Testimony</p>
<p>Xu Jishi, captain of the water patrol team of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, received a report from Gao Hongxing the night before last around 9:00 PM. Gao Hongxing, from Ningbo, 30 years old, was a night watchman on the Jinyuanyuan sand boat. "Today, we moored the boat in the Pujiang River at the new dock. At around 10:00 AM, seven people suddenly came onto the boat and held a secret conference. I wanted to intervene, but I saw that there were many of them, and their attitude was not good, so I was afraid of being harmed. They have been staying there until now and have not left the boat. Please investigate." Immediately, detectives Yang Chunting, patrol officer Wu Minshen, and others were dispatched to the boat and took the seven people conferring secretly, Ding Guangshang, Wang Yubiao, Zhang Jinlong, Hu Zhide, Wang Xiaosanzi, Sun Debiao, Yang Yougui, and the boat captain (i.e., helmsman) Zhu Naihe, to the team. During the preliminary hearing, Ding stated that he was 32 years old, from Siyang, and worked as a detective in the third district of the Jiangsu Water Police Team. He had come to Shanghai from Suzhou with Wang and the other six to handle an important case. Because the weather was hot, they were resting on the boat. Wang Yubiao stated that he was 27 years old, from Shandong, residing in Yangjing. Zhang stated that he was 31 years old, from Funing, and worked as a back scrubber in the Yulongchi Bathhouse. Hu stated that he was 24 years old, from Suqian, and had been a rower. Wang Xiaosanzi stated that he was 24 years old, from Shandong, and had been a boatman. Sun stated that he was 36 years old, from Lianshui. Yang stated that he was 30 years old, from Gaoyou. The captain found their story suspicious, so he interrogated each person separately, starting at 2:00 AM yesterday. After investigating the details of each person's testimony, he found many contradictions. Furthermore, recently there have been people in the Pujiang River who, under the guise of being from government organs, have been engaging in illegal activities. If they had come on official business, why didn't they first report to the police district to cooperate, but instead occupied a civilian boat and conferred secretly for eight or nine hours? They were clearly not good people. He ordered that they all be transferred to the third section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Boy Climbs into Amusement Park, Loses Life</h3>
<p>Touches Electric Wire, Electrocuted</p>
<p>Electric Shock Proves Incurable</p>
<p>The newly opened China National United Shopping Mall at the former site of the Nanjing Road Municipal Hall has an attached Tongle Amusement Park. The day before yesterday, a fifteen-year-old boy, Tan Shengfa, tried to climb from the shopping mall into the amusement park to enjoy himself, in order to avoid paying for a ticket. While climbing, the boy grabbed an electric wire, but the rubber covering had been removed, causing his hand to come into contact with the electricity. Instantly, the current passed through his body, and he collapsed to the ground. He was sent to the hospital by a patrol car, but it was already too late. He died of electrocution. The police took the body to the Fei Lun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, prosecutor Xu from the Special District Local Court went to the morgue to investigate, confirming the cause of death as electrocution. He informed the deceased's father, Tan Daohui, and instructed him to make a statement to claim the body for burial.</p>

First, the bags were hoisted down with iron hooks, and then the laborers shouldered them onto the wharf. Liu, eager to start working, was knocked to the ground by more than ten bags of yellow beans, and was suffocated to death. He was sent to Tongren Hospital by the people vehicle, but before he could receive treatment, he died.</p>
<h3>Absurd Woman Jumps into Huangpu River</h3>
<p>This Measure is Due to a Dead End</p>
<p>Saved by Boatman, Avoids Death</p>
<p>The night before last at 7:00 PM, a middle-aged woman boarded the No. 12 ferry at the Hankou Road New Customs Wharf to cross the river to Pudong. When the boat reached the center of the river, the woman suddenly jumped into the river, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately, the captain, Su Yalang, managed to rescue her. When asked why she had taken such an action, she remained silent, only sobbing. She was sent to the water police station. According to her statement, her surname was Zheng Jiang, 36 years old, from Changzhou. She firmly refused to explain the reason for her suicide. However, she seemed distressed. She said that her husband's name was Zheng Maoyao, from Changshu, and he runs the Yongheyuan foreign goods store in Jiangyin. She had two friends, one named Gu Xihong and the other named Zhang Wenkui, who worked at the Rongda Foreign Goods Store at No. 89 Lujiazhai, Pudong. According to the captain, the detectives ordered Cheng Yongnian to go to the address and bring Gu and Zhang to the police station. After questioning, it was revealed that the woman had a romantic past. She was naturally fickle and restless at home. In March of this year, she had an affair with a partner named Wang in her husband's store. Because there were many eyes and ears in the store, making it difficult to do as she pleased, she abandoned her husband, taking clothes and ornaments worth more than a hundred dollars, and more than thirty dollars in cash, and ran away to Shanghai with Wang. They rented a small house in Zhabei, living together like a married couple. They lived together for four months, but Wang had no regular work, and his food, clothing, and lodging depended on the woman's support. The limited money she brought was completely exhausted, and she had borrowed a lot of money from her two friends, Gu and Zhang, which was also used up. They were about to have nothing to eat. The woman, at this point, regretted her actions, but it was too late. If she returned to her husband's family, they would definitely not accept her. If she returned to her mother's home, she would have no face. Forced to the point of desperation, she attempted suicide. Subsequently, the police found fourteen pawn tickets on her person. The captain, considering that her absurd and unrestrained actions were of her own making, ordered her to be taken away by her two friends on the spot. Gu and Zhang indicated that if they sent her to her husband's family in Jiangyin, her husband, being a respectable businessman, would not accept her because of his reputation. Therefore, they still intended to send her back to her mother's home.</p>

<p>Book Reviews</p>
<h3>Bai Xue Yi Yin Continued Selection: Li Zanhua</h3>
<p>In the minds of ordinary people, it is thought that only scholars who have drunk a bellyful of ink can produce good literature. In my opinion, however, this is not entirely the case. No matter how much ink they have drunk, or how far their writing has reached, there is still much in their works that cannot be considered literature. Conversely, no matter how uncultured some people may be, they can still produce good literary works. So-called good literature is not simply about pursuing ornate language and elegant style. The first condition is that we must see if it flows from genuine emotion and true nature. Therefore, from folk songs, we have discovered much good literature from uncultured people. Generally, because their emotions reach a point where they cannot contain themselves, they burst into song. Thus, some songs become exquisite lyrics, spread among the people, and emit a brilliant and unique splendor in literature. V.I.C.TALE says, "In Chinese folk songs, one can find some true poetry... These things, although made by people who do not understand classical Chinese, have a kind of poetic regularity similar to that of various European countries..." This is what we should believe.</p>
<p>Folk songs are naturally expressed by the general public due to the impulse of urgent emotions. Therefore, it is inevitable that they lean towards love songs. In Chinese folk love songs, the "Guo Feng" in the Book of Songs is undoubtedly the earliest. Zheng Qiao said, "Feng comes from local customs, mostly the words of humble men, lowly servants, women, and girls. Although their meaning is far-reaching, their words are shallow and repetitive, hence they are called Feng." Zhu Xi said it even more directly, "Feng are poems about the feelings of men and women in the streets and alleys." These two explanations are very accurate. The value of the Book of Songs lies in the fact that it contains these words of emotion that flow from genuine feelings and true nature. After the Book of Songs, there were originally many folk songs, but no one collected and organized them, allowing them to be lost and die out. This is a great pity. As for modern folk songs, no one seems to value them.</p>
<p>Only in recent years has it gained the attention of some people, but there are still no significant achievements.</p>
<p>"Bai Xue Yi Yin" (Remnants of White Snow Tunes) is a collection of modern folk love songs. We must thank the collector of the book, Guang Huasheng, for preserving it to this day, giving us the opportunity to appreciate it. He was born during the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty, more than a hundred years ago. At that time, he was able to have a unique vision and understanding, and spent a lot of effort to collect these folk songs, which is truly rare. We see that he said, "The four volumes of music scores were collected from many sources, over a long period of time, accumulating little by little, and were completed after a lot of effort." Moreover, it is said that he imitated the "Ma Tou Diao" (Horse Head Tune) in the preface and wrote a song, the first sentence of which is, "This little music book is my beloved," and the last sentence is, "I wouldn't sell it for ten thousand taels of gold." This is how loyal he was to his love of art.</p>
<p>Now, this "Bai Xue Yi Yin" has become the only extant copy. I think it has gone through a lot of misfortune, but it is still a great blessing in misfortune. The book fell into the hands of Mr. Zheng Zhenduo, so it was not lost. However, Mr. Zheng did not have the courage to print the obscene love songs in the original book. Therefore, a few years ago, he only selected a part of it for printing, named "Bai Xue Yi Yin Xuan" (Selected Remnants of White Snow Tunes), and said in the preface, "Perhaps because some of the obscene love songs in the original book were banned from sale or destroyed by some government officials, this book can no longer be found today. We are very fortunate to be able to see the only surviving copy." From this, we can see how much folk love songs were devastated under the old feudal system and the influence of the old ethics. Fortunately, this "Bai Xue Yi Yin" still has a surviving copy in the country. I think many similar love songs must have been sacrificed.</p>
<p>I read "Bai Xue Yi Yin Xuan" at Jian Changyou's place, but I always felt that it was not enough to see the whole book. Now, after several years, I unexpectedly saw the publication of this "Bai Xue Yi Yin Continued Selection." I feel unexpectedly happy.</p>
<p>"Bai Xue Yi Yin Continued Selection" is a further selection of 207 songs from "Bai Xue Yi Yin," and it boldly selects all the obscene love songs that Mr. Zheng did not have the courage to print.</p>
<p>Speaking of obscene love songs, they are generally about singing about private love and sexual intercourse. In China, there are many poems about private love, such as Ouyang Xiu's "Sheng Zha Zi," "The moon rises on the willow tip, a rendezvous after dusk," which are very common and not taboo. However, those that mention sexual intercourse are mostly implicit and use symbolic words to express it, such as the exchange of letters in "The Story of the Western Chamber," "Ah, Liu and Ruan went to Tiantai, spring comes to earth and flowers bloom, the willow waist sways gently, the flower heart is gently folded, dew drips and the peony opens," and in Bi Yu's poem, "When Bi Yu broke her maidenhood, she was so in love with her lover that she was not ashamed, she turned around and embraced him." There are many examples like this. As for using the words "clouds and rain" to symbolize it, it is even more common. However, there are no bold descriptions.</p>
<p>As for the obscene love songs in this book, almost every one about "private love" is about Bi Zhu. Her passionate, fiery descriptions are even more unique.</p>
<p>Some people say that the obscenity of love songs is evidence of the corruption of folk customs, but I dare not easily believe this. I believe that the occurrence of obscene love songs is precisely due to the motive of men and women seeking free love, or due to dissatisfaction with sexual relations. Although in the eyes of moralists, it should be kept secret, but the fact is that it is so, and you cannot suppress it.</p>
<p>Originally, the central figures in love songs are mostly women. Therefore, in this book, we can see even more how women who yearn for love under the influence of the old ethics are struggling, as well as their psychology. Here are women who betray their husbands and have affairs, young girls who are pregnant in their boudoirs, prostitutes who live day and night, and nuns who live inhuman lives. These people have done things for love that others dare not do, and sing love songs that others dare not sing. Now, let's give examples of what they express in their love songs. How bold is the following song describing a woman who betrays her husband and has an affair:</p>
<p>Lover, you don't have to be afraid,</p>
<p>I'm here.</p>
<p>The one calling at the door outside is my husband,</p>
<p>He's an old cuckold.</p>
<p>If you're afraid, hide quietly under the bed,</p>
<p>That's the best way.</p>
<p>When he comes, I'll find a way to send him away.</p>
<p>First, tell him to scrape the pot,</p>
<p>Buy oil, buy salt, and bring back tea,</p>
<p>And buy wine.</p>
<p>Tell your lover to take the opportunity to sneak away,</p>
<p>I'll bolt the door.</p>
<p>If he runs into him, just say you came to pay your respects by mistake,</p>
<p>Don't offend him.</p>
<p>Such a love song, describing the scenery and narrating the feelings, is all-encompassing, gentle, delicate, true, lively, and without any trace of carving. How touching and rare it is. Moreover, there is such a thing happening in society every day. How faithfully she sings it out.</p>
<p>Next, let's see how panicked a young girl who is having an affair in the boudoir under the influence of the old ethics is:</p>
<p>Since the day we met,</p>
<p>Playing with you has made me catch a cold.</p>
<p>My little belly feels a little swollen,</p>
<p>My mother says I don't look like a human being.</p>
<p>Is it a disease or a pregnancy,</p>
<p>This is hard to bear.</p>
<p>My dear lover,</p>
<p>My little life is being ruined by you,</p>
<p>My little life is being ruined by you.</p>
<p>Under the terror of the old ethics, the young girl's</p>
<p>The psychology of fear of having an affair is most deeply expressed in this poem. "My little life is being ruined by you" is such a sad and painful cry.</p>
<p>The examples cited above refer to ordinary women. Now, let's see what the so-called nuns who are supposed to be free from worldly desires are like:</p>
<p>What use is there for being a nun,</p>
<p>Think for yourself,</p>
<p>Chanting scriptures and worshiping Buddha,</p>
<p>And burning incense,</p>
<p>Still rushing around,</p>
<p>The sound of bells and drums shakes my soul,</p>
<p>It's really a living hell.</p>
<p>Before worshiping Buddha, the sacred lamp shines on my ugly appearance,</p>
<p>Big feet and bald head,</p>
<p>In front of the master, I have to pretend,</p>
<p>And pretend to be reserved,</p>
<p>It's really the fire of lust burning my heart,</p>
<p>Guarding the empty room at night,</p>
<p>Thinking about it, tears fall drop by drop on the scriptures,</p>
<p>Soaking thousands of lines.</p>
<p>This nun, who is burned by the fire of lust, expresses her grievances and troubles extremely deeply. The so-called "It's really a living hell." Originally, there are seven songs about nuns, such as "Little Nun," "Si Fan" (Thinking of the World), and "Little Nunnery," but I think "Little Nunnery" is the most poignant and moving:</p>
<p>The little nunnery opens with the character "eight,"</p>
<p>The nun looks for her husband in front of the hall.</p>
<p>The main hall is changed into a love-sickness pavilion,</p>
<p>The bell tower is completely turned into a husband-gazing platform.</p>
<p>Last year, the mistress was pregnant with six children,</p>
<p>This year, the disciple is pregnant again.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a piece of Sambao land behind,</p>
<p>I don't know how many little babies are buried there,</p>
<p>Reincarnate early.</p>
<p>This satire is full of blood and tears. How many babies were killed in that Sambao land? How touching is it to write? Can we not recognize its value?</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how prostitutes live:</p>
<p>Get up in the morning and stand in front of the door,</p>
<p>No clothes on,</p>
<p>Complaining about the cold weather,</p>
<p>I haven't seen a customer for the past few days.</p>
<p>Grab someone and drag them to the pleasure house,</p>
<p>Don't think you're flirting,</p>
<p>Just think you're pitiful.</p>
<p>I've only eaten one meal in three days.</p>
<p>Call the men, "Give me eight big coins for a bowl of noodles."</p>
<p>However, some people say that this is just a poor prostitute. Of course, it cannot be said that all prostitutes are like this. If you don't mind it being long, then I'll give another example:</p>
<p>I advise my lover to go straight,</p>
<p>What are you addicted to in the pleasure quarters?</p>
<p>Think carefully,</p>
<p>You've been beaten and scolded a lot.</p>
<p>The money you've earned in the past few years,</p>
<p>None of it is left.</p>
<p>When a woman passes thirty, her beauty fades like the moon,</p>
<p>When you're old, change your face and think of my words,</p>
<p>At that time, no one will marry you if you want to go straight.</p>
<p>This prostitute, whose life as a goddess is just a dream, is finally portrayed to the bone. Like that poor prostitute, being both a "prostitute" and "poor" is naturally even more miserable. But don't we often see them, like ghosts, sadly active on the dark streets?</p>
<p>The above seems to have listed several kinds of descriptions of women. There are also some extremely humorous and interesting ones. Let's give one of them as an example:</p>
<p>Entering the door, he grabs my hand,</p>
<p>"I'm a scholar,</p>
<p>You don't welcome me?</p>
<p>If you welcome me, I'll talk to you about romance with brocade articles,</p>
<p>Talk about intimacy,</p>
<p>Knowing pain, knowing cold, and knowing heat,</p>
<p>I can write any love letter immediately,</p>
<p>If you want money, I'll take care of the lawsuits for you,</p>
<p>If you want money, I'll take care of the ghostwriting for you."</p>
<p>Second</p>
<p>The beauty smiles,</p>
<p>"Since you're a scholar,</p>
<p>You shouldn't be prostituting.</p>
<p>Since you're prostituting, either bring money or banknotes,</p>
<p>Who's going to mess around with you in the red light district?</p>
<p>What are you talking about, articles,</p>
<p>What are you talking about, learning?</p>
<p>I'm not the imperial examiner who personally appointed the director of studies,</p>
<p>I'm not the imperial examiner who personally appointed the director of studies."</p>
<p>This makes a sour scholar spin vividly before our eyes. Originally, in Chinese humorous songs, most of them are about fearing wives and big-footed women, but this one is particularly interesting. Now the title of scholar is gone, but there are probably not fewer new-style scholars of the red men and green women type who "can write any love letter immediately."</p>
<p>In short, I think this book of folk love songs is rare and good literature. It can even be said that all Guo Feng, Zi Ye Ge, and Du Qu Ge are not as good as it. Its advantages are as Mr. Guo Shaoyu said, "Because he doesn't understand the format, he is not bound by the format. He also doesn't want to carve, so he is not burdened by carving." Mr. Zhang Hongxi even said, "Because he doesn't understand morality, he is not bound by morality. He also has no learning, so he is not burdened by learning." I also want to add two sentences for him: "Because they are brave, they dare to do things that ordinary people dare not do. Because they are bold, they dare to sing love songs of genuine feelings and true nature that ordinary people dare not sing."</p>

The founder was Mr. Liu Zhennan. It was formerly located in Yuqing Lane, Baker Road. Since moving to the new location last summer, it has been managed by Mr. Liu Jun's grandson, Shou Shouming, and the results have been remarkable. Recently, in order to connect feelings, a Guoshu Research Group has been organized and plans to visit various technical groups.</p>
<p>The 26th of this month is the one-month anniversary of the daughter of Mr. Guan Hongbin, a Beijing opera teacher. A banquet was held at Fuxing Garden on Pingwang Street, Sima Road, to entertain friends, and famous amateur opera singers were invited to perform Beijing opera from 2:00 pm to help the fun.

<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Shijie Grand Theater on Qingyun Road, Zhabei, claims that the theater will show Tianyi Film Company's latest film, "Yang Naiwu and Xiao Baicai," the upper part of one of the four famous cases of the Qing Dynasty, starting today. The plot, characters, and scenery are all perfect, and it is the company's most magnificent production. Chen Yumei's starring role adds to the glory. The theater will give away a beautifully crafted cigarette case with a portrait of movie star Hu Die on the second floor with every ticket, as a special offer.</p>
<p>The Xialing Paike Movie Theater claims that the theater has specially hired Nicola, the only greatest magic genius of the 20th century, at a high price, to perform his intellectual crystallization of magic tricks, both large and small, on stage at the theater starting tonight. At the same time, there will be 15 beautiful women performing on stage.</p>
<p>The Dadong Jinshi Company claims that the company has produced very few films over the years, but they have been well received by audiences at home and abroad. Last year, director Wang Fuqing reorganized and expanded the company internally and invited Mr. Yang Xiaozhong to write a play called "The Legend of the Righteous Hero, Part 1," also known as "The Strange Hero of the Ancient Country." The plot is tortuous, the scenery is magnificent, and Wang himself directed it. It has now been completed and will be premiered in Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>The Guangdong Grand Theater claims that the local Cantonese opera theaters have always only had one, the Guang Wutai on Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. Although the theater has repeatedly hired famous opera troupes from Guangdong to perform on stage over the years, the location is not very lively, and it has been in disrepair for a long time, resulting in poor business. Recently, wealthy businessmen such as Mr. Chen have raised funds to establish a very magnificent Cantonese opera theater called the Guangdong Grand Theater. The address is selected opposite Dade Lane on North Sichuan Road. The project has been contracted by Lianyi Construction Factory, and a large number of floor tiles have been ordered from Yizhong Machinery Company Porcelain Factory in Hankou Road to pave the theater's stage with tiles to enhance the spectacle. People have also been sent to Guangdong to negotiate with famous actors Xue Juexian and Chen Feinong to come to Shanghai to perform. It will open soon.</p>
<p>The Huangjin Grand Theater claims that it will show "Western Hero," starring the equestrian battle star Tom Mix and the famous horse Tony, starting today. The play features Western athletes capturing wild horses and training wild horses. Tom Mix has not been to Shanghai for a long time, and the theater has specially ordered the right to premiere it. At this time, the seat price is reduced and this famous film is shown. Please do not miss the opportunity.</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>
<p>The Miaoji Department Store on North Sichuan Road claims that the company will hold a ninth anniversary lottery this month. Customers who buy goods worth more than one silver dollar will receive a lottery ticket. The more you buy, the more you get. The lottery tickets are all numbered. After the lottery, you can redeem the prize by matching the number. There are only a few days left until the lottery date, so customers from all walks of life are very crowded.</p>
<p>The Huimin Milk Powder Company claims that milk cake can replace milk and the price is very cheap. Although it is enough to fill the stomach, it does not contain "vital elements" (i.e., nutrients) to form the basis for the healthy development of babies. The price of ordinary milk powder is twice as high as that of milk cake, but its function is no different from that of milk cake. Except for a very small amount of milk, the rest is only enough to fill the stomach and does not contain substances that supplement health. The reason why Huimin milk powder is superior to ordinary milk powder is that it is made from pure and healthy milk using the latest scientific methods. The casein is completely intact, and the "vital elements" are completely preserved. Eating it daily can nourish the body and strengthen the foundation, and it is clean and hygienic. It can also enhance resistance and prevent the invasion of diseases. Moreover, it is completely operated by Chinese people and the price is very cheap. Chinese people often lack common sense and often mistakenly buy ordinary milk powder, which is expensive and has no real benefit. Huimin milk powder is packed in blue cans, which are nutritious and suitable for both the elderly and children. The red can contains light oil and is more effective than breast milk. It has been repeatedly proven by Chinese and Western doctors to be the only tonic suitable for the Chinese physique, and it is also the supreme sacred product for raising babies. Major stores in Shanghai and other places sell it. The head office is located inside the new house of Shanghai Shen Bao.</p>
<p>The Tongyi Tobacco Company in Ruikang Lane, Beijing Road, claims that the Qingqing brand ten-pack cigarettes produced by the company's exclusive agent, Taida Tobacco Factory, are well-made, fragrant, and affordable. Each pack sells for only ten copper coins, and empty packs can be exchanged for cigarette towels. Since its launch, it has been very popular in the society for only two months. The sales are very strong and there is not enough to distribute. The company now notifies Dada Tobacco Factory to work day and night to catch up to avoid shortages.</p>
<p>The Yong'an Company Music Department claims that the number of new Cantonese records in the department is the largest among all companies, and the price is also cheaper, so the sales are very strong. A large number of the tenth-period Bija records have arrived again. Among them, such as Bai Ju Rong's "Elegy," Xue Juexian's "Hongniang Asks About Illness," Xi Luxia's "Three Heroes of the Wind and Dust," and Chang'e Ying's "Wartime Orioles," are all unprecedented masterpieces. Gentlemen who love new songs, please do not miss it.</p>
<p>The Zhonghua Guohuo Consumption Cooperative (Chinese National Goods Consumption Cooperative) was established more than half a year ago and has achieved considerable results. Recently, many letters have been received from various places asking for brochures, so in view of the fact that the cooperative business adopts economic methods to improve life and seek the interests of the people, in order to popularize it, the cooperative is holding a party at the Atlantic Vegetable Society tonight to promote the cooperative business. Invitation cards have been sent by the secretariat, and a grand occasion can be expected.</p>

<h3>Automobile Engineering Association's</h3>
<p>Silver Week History Exhibition Records Government</p>
<p>All Items Are Valuable</p>
<p>Like Reading the History of Automobile Evolution</p>
<p>The Automobile Engineering Association's (S.A.E.) Silver Week anniversary, which caused a sensation, has concluded in Indiana. Among the exhibits at this anniversary celebration, the "History Exhibition" is particularly noteworthy. It encompasses a wide range of items, collecting and displaying all kinds of ancient automobile models. The venue for the History Exhibition was located below the conference hall, but due to the large number of items, the glass rooms to the left and right of the entrance were also used as temporary exhibition spaces in addition to the hall. What we could easily see was the Smith Research Institute's history of the evolution of internal combustion engines. It displayed various internal combustion engines specially patented by political parties from 1844 to the present, with detailed explanations. In addition, the association also had five antique automobile engines, four of which were dismantled from old cars in the museum. These old cars also have a long history and are always the first of their kind. For example, the first car personally built by Earls was also among them. Apart from the four dismantled ones, the remaining one was built by Dack in 1901, which can also be said to be the first carburetor engine in the United States.</p>
<p>In another room, there was the history of aircraft evolution. This was especially grand because the engines built by many famous inventors, such as Whirl White, Avell, Wright, etc., even before 1903, were also on display. It is said that these were borrowed from General Motors. There was also an engine hand-built by the great inventor Mr. Monlai, which contained many similarities to recent engines. It was a five-cylinder air conditioner, capable of producing 52 horsepower at 950 revolutions per minute and weighing 115 pounds. Almost everyone knows about Wright (WRIGHTT). His engine was a four-cylinder model with a flywheel, producing 30 to 35 horsepower and weighing 180 pounds. The Parker Company also had the first flight engine they invented, drawn by Fox and Sheng, which was also extremely valuable. Its test flight was on September 19, 1928.</p>
<p>Walking down there was the military vehicle made by General Pershing, the commander of the American European War. General Pershing is the most admired American, so his handiwork attracted even more attention. Quite a few photos were hanging in the reception room, all of the association's former presidents. On the lower level, the first was a 1902 Pierce touring car. There were also many prints, all advertisements and other promotional materials from the early days of the automobile industry. The Fry Rubber Company also publicly exhibited its progress since 1898, which was colorful and very beautiful. Another historically valuable thing was the most famous 999 race car, invented by Ford. This race car was the first car to break the record of one mile per minute. I still remember the day of the test drive in 1904, when Mr. Ford personally drove it in Baltimore Bay, and it was a success. This car is still personally preserved by Ford. This historical exhibition specially arranged to borrow it. The next was the 1903 Ford Model A car, as well as the 15 millionth Model T car. The most interesting was a Hansman automobile, built in 1902, priced at 800 yuan. Looking at it now, it's really laughable because its equipment couldn't be simpler, and it only has two cylinders. Apart from this, there were the first products of various manufacturers.</p>
<p>After seeing this great automobile history exhibition, we couldn't help but have some thoughts. What were they? It was seeing that from the earliest machines to the present, it has only been about two or three decades, but there is progress every year and improvement every day. Therefore, in a short period of time, many brilliant flowers and fruits have been planted. The greatness of scientists is naturally very astonishing. Secondly, after seeing many engines evolve from simple to sophisticated, it was like reading a history of automobile evolution. At least it can make us feel two meanings. First, when we look at the products of the old era, we must know their greatness and not laugh at them for being naive because the beginning is the most difficult thing in the world. It is very easy to improve after that. This is the first point worth commemorating. Second, we know the perseverance and progress of our predecessors, and it was in a very short period of time. Then, we must also work harder to learn from these inventors.</p>
<p>The History Exhibition was the last and most brilliant scene. The items inside were extremely precious and were collected through various means. After the History Exhibition ended, the Silver Anniversary also closed. In addition to the History Exhibition, there were other exhibitions at this Automobile Engineering Association anniversary, as well as important engineering discussions. Many plans were agreed upon, which will be published one after another in the future. We will report to readers at that time. (From Jiaotong University)</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Sixth International Road Conference</h3>
<p>Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Twenty-Seven Countries Invited</p>
<p>To Be Held in Mid-October Next Year</p>
<p>The Sixth International Road Conference is scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C. in mid-October next year. During this preparation period, the general preparation committee is extremely busy, and the number of countries invited to participate in the conference has reached 27 so far. According to the conference secretary, Thomas McDonald, the preparation committee will definitely receive letters from various countries in the next six or seven weeks, agreeing to participate in the conference. According to the records of the previous conference, as many as 53 countries sent invitations in mid-January last year. However, the political situation in various countries changes from time to time, and social organizations are also subject to change. Therefore, the attendance was not very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Among the invitations issued this time, there are many important countries. As for whether they will attend the conference, the official side has not made a formal statement. Among them are Germany, Britain, France, Italy, India, China, Japan, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Latin America, Canada, etc., which have not yet given a formal reply. Other countries, which have officially agreed to participate, include Bulgaria, Denmark, Egypt, Nicaragua, Hong Kong, Greece, the Irish Free State, Norway, Poland, Romania, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Czechoslovakia. Latin America also has hopes of attending. In addition, after receiving the invitations, various countries expressed extreme approval and prepared to participate, including Mexico and Peru. When the conference opens, in addition to the governments of various countries sending representatives for formal meetings, private groups or semi-official organizations, such as automobile associations, road associations, and private individuals who study road construction, can also attend. Because the holding of this conference is not limited to government officials only. Therefore, the conference has prepared for thousands of representatives to participate in the conference, and there are already many applications for membership from private groups and individuals.</p>
<p>When the conference opens, the most important proposals will be two, which have now been decided to be discussed: (1) The construction and maintenance methods of plateau roads; (2) Transportation rules and management methods. The steps for discussing the above two issues are divided into three points for each. Regarding the first question: (A) Which is superior, using cement, brick, and other artistic paving methods on the road surface? (B) Which is more suitable for using coal tar, asphalt, or bitumen to build roads? (C) The road construction methods for emerging countries or villages, such as territories and uncivilized countries. Regarding the second question: (A) The economy and purpose of building plateau roads; (B) The planning of cooperation between plateau road lines and plain road transportation; (C) Traffic rules for large cities and villages, as well as the designation of parking lots. When the conference opens, there is also one thing that can be told to the readers, that is, the American Road Builders' Association plans to publicly exhibit the materials and tools for building plateau roads for the reference and research of the participating representatives. When the conference opens in the future, among the seven secretaries-general, five will be dedicated to reporting the news of the Sixth Road Conference. The report items are divided into six categories, and each category is reported by two secretaries. Others, such as those with rich experience in road construction, have important reports. For example, Frank Hedd, an engineer of the Illinois Plateau Road, plans to publicly report the process of building roads with cement. Louis Clam, the president of the Washington Plateau Road Association, will also propose research on the problem of using bituminous coal or asphalt on the ground. Kim, of the Plateau Road Economic Association, will have a detailed report on the plateau roads of emerging countries. Or the professor of Stuttgart University will report on the construction methods of plateau roads. Dr. McLean, a road expert at Harvard University, also has important discussions on the management methods of urban and rural roads, as well as parking locations. The above-mentioned people are all enthusiastic about road construction, and their rich experience is self-evident. Therefore, all proposals and opinions expressed by each person have great value. The position of secretary-general will be held by these five people.</p>
<p>The five people will try to report all the proposals every day, so that all countries in the world can know the details. Secretary-General McDonald predicts that there will be more representatives attending this conference than in previous years. As for the South American countries, since they switched to using Spanish, it is also the first time they have participated in the road conference. According to the rules of the conference, each secretary's report must be written on one paper, with no more than 1,000 words, and signed by the secretary-general. There are currently 84 scheduled reports. The participating representatives can get a copy of each of these reports. As for the text, it is divided into four types, namely English, French, German, and Spanish. After translating the various reports into the languages of the four countries, the participating representatives can choose one at will.</p>
<p>The Sixth International Road Conference will be held in Washington, D.C., as mentioned above. Therefore, the invitations from various countries were issued by the U.S. government. The staff designated Louis Garvin, president of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce of the United States, as chairman, and McDonald as secretary-general. If there are no accidents during the meeting, the appointed staff will generally not be changed. During the conference, the American Plateau Road Builders' Association also plans to publicly exhibit all the raw materials and equipment used for the plateau roads. The venue is at the Washington Automobile Association.</p>
<h3>Hudson Eight-Cylinder Sedan with a Novel Small Outline</h3>
<p>It is expected that during the exhibition, staff from various automobile factories and workers from road material factories will come from afar to visit. People from various overseas locations may also come to visit. The holding of this conference is an excellent opportunity for the participating representatives to refer to or learn from, and all the new road construction tools are available.</p>
<p>In addition, there is one more thing that can make the participating representatives very satisfied, that is, the conference has prepared one day of time to allow all the representatives to visit the plateau road in Baerford Mountain. The roads there are completely built using the latest methods and are currently underway. The representatives will be able to gain a lot of new knowledge on this trip. It is expected that more than 50 countries will attend the meeting. The conference pays special attention to road construction materials. It is hoped that the participating representatives will report their personal experiences and experiences in public, so as to exchange each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and promote the progress of the road industry. Recalling this International Road Conference, it has been held five times before. The first time was in Paris in 1908, the second time was in Brussels in 1910, the third time was in London in 1913, the fourth time was in Seville in 1923, and the fifth time was in Milan in 1928. The sixth time will be held in Washington in October next year, from Monday, October 6 to Saturday, October 11, for a week.</p>
<h3>Sixteen-Cylinder New Car Debuts</h3>
<p>Driving in the City Is Very Convenient</p>
<p>New York News. When the National Automobile Exhibition was held, a car factory introduced a sixteen-cylinder car to the audience. At that time, it attracted more attention from people in the automobile manufacturing industry than expected. At first, the public thought that this car was only for display purposes. But now they know that this kind of manufacturing is actually successful. It can be asserted that it can affect the future of multi-cylinder car manufacturing. When Cadillac Motor Company announced its V-16 car, it had four characteristics that were noted by the public. The characteristics are power, durability, comfort, and ease of driving. When the public first visited this car, they all acknowledged the first three characteristics. But they could not help but doubt the last item, ease of driving. Recently, this new car has been placed in widespread publicity. The last item of characteristic attracts the most. This car is very large, and the driving is convenient. The wheels rotate, echoing inside and outside the machine. Anyone who has driven this car knows that it is light and convenient.</p>
<p>The engine of the Cadillac V-16 is a valve-in-head type with inherent uniformity. Its displacement is 452 cubic inches, and the horsepower is in the range of 175 horsepower. The concentrated power of this car engine, born from the driving force, can be imagined from the dictionary annotation of horsepower below. Horsepower is "the standard unit of power, equal to 33,000 pounds, lifted one foot high in one minute." According to the above calculation, this V-16 engine can lift 16 tons one hundred and seventy-five feet one thousand four hundred and forty times in an almost unlimited amount of time. It takes several years of research work to subject this kind of concentrated power to management to ensure all the results. The most commendable of these is the smoothness when driving, regardless of speed or rough road surface. This kind of car can slide by itself even at high speeds. This characteristic is often mixed with mechanical power, and its rate of increase is greater than that of rapid progress. Much attention has been paid to the comfort of this car during manufacturing. This attention is not only in terms of seat adjustment and internal sophistication, but also in special attention to the movement when driving. For such a huge car, it is most difficult to correct the gravity. However, this car has been resolved on this point. If you travel long distances, you will not feel tired at all. As for the smoothness of the sliding motion, it makes the owner feel that the journey is shortened. When the sixteen cylinders work at the same time, there is no sound. Because the engine uses an automatic muffler, the piston movement does not feel deafening.</p>
<p>The adaptability of the gear lever is easy and flexible. It is easy to go high or low with just a wave of your hand. This is due to the non-conflicting adjustment transmission. The action of the Keller's is also the same. Although they are very large when you see them, when you drive them, they are light and agile, which is very strange. The convenience of the steering wheel also gives you power. The movement of the wheels is completely guided by slight pressure without the help of small pulleys. This V-16 car is indeed viewed by the public, and its characteristics are unprecedented in the automobile manufacturing industry. It can be asserted that there will be extraordinary results.</p>
<h3>Developing the Chinese Interior Must Start with Roads</h3>
<p>Since the eastward journey of Europeanization, my country's doors have been opened. The empire, known for its mystery and greatness, has become a market for international trade. In recent decades, times have changed, and the environment has greatly changed. Counties and villages that have never been in contact with each other and neighboring countries that have no relationship with each other have become closer to each other due to the development of sea and land transportation and the convenience of boats and vehicles. Now in the 20th century, the relationship between China and foreign countries is becoming more and more close, and my country's trend is also changing with the new trend. The inland border provinces are undertaking large-scale projects, building roads one after another, and using automobiles to facilitate transportation. In addition, the Chinese Road Association is working urgently to improve the road administration in the interior and promote the awareness of the whole country. The achievements of the outstanding scholars are most praised by us. This year is the tenth anniversary of the association. According to the latest report, there are now 26,666 miles of roads in my country, spanning all provinces of the country, which is enough for transportation. Although there have been years of war recently, the people have spared no effort in road construction plans. The authorities continue to carry out road construction work.</p>
<p>Nanchang, an ancient county, is the capital of Jiangxi Province. It is more than 900 miles away from Shanghai. It defends the ancient style. Two years ago, there were no clean roads, and automobiles were regarded as strange objects. However, in recent years, progress has been rapid, with thorough reforms. Roads are now being built urgently to facilitate business and transportation. The Nanchang of today and yesterday are indeed worlds apart. The main roads in the city run through in all directions, and passenger and cargo vehicles come and go endlessly. The market is bustling, and commerce is booming. The whole city has taken on a new look. Recently, it has also planned to develop the automobile industry outside the city and expand automobile roads to reach neighboring cities and villages, so as to promote transportation and business. There are now more than 70 vehicles in service, carrying cargo and passengers.</p>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>It has a great effect.</p>
<p>Nanchang in Jiangxi can be a model for road construction in the whole country. It recently announced a plan to open up five major new roads, which are planned to connect major cities in the interior and reach important ports such as Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou. It is currently in urgent progress, and it is estimated that the construction cost will be about 6 million yuan.</p>
<p>There are similar plans for long-distance construction in South China. Since Dr. Sun Yat-sen established the capital in Guangzhou in 1922, he has spared no effort in advocating road construction. At that time, the highways that had been built had more than 8,000 miles, which facilitated transportation, inspired business, improved municipal administration, and met the people's hearts. Therefore, the internal affairs of the Southern Government were consolidated, and there was no need to worry about foreign aggression, so that the current National Government could be established. The direction of road construction has made a great contribution.</p>
<p>In 1929, the Guangxi Provincial Government's financial expenditure was mostly used for road construction, totaling more than 3 million yuan. This year's budget is even higher. Five years ago, Nanning was still a decaying provincial capital. Now, after the construction of roads, it has taken on a new look and become the central point of the provincial road, connecting major cities throughout the province. Today's Nanning has become the lifeline of Guangxi. The beauty of its roads and the speed of its development are not weaker than other provinces. The urgency of its promotion of road administration can be seen from the report of the Nanning Customs.</p>
<p>According to the Nanning Road Construction Plan, there are specialized engineers to guide it, so its achievements are more obvious. The roads are strong, and the mileage is longer. Therefore, today automobiles can cross mountains and ridges, penetrate deep into the interior, and travel hundreds of miles without any obstacles. It is extremely fast and convenient. It is now planned to build new scriptures to connect the remote areas of the province and open up branches to reach the riverbanks and seaports.</p>
<p>Guizhou is far away on the border and has always been isolated from other places, but its road construction is said to be rapidly advancing. Last spring, more than 50,000 farmers and citizens rushed to build roads, building a main line from Guiyang in the north to Anshan in the west, totaling more than 60 miles. The project is quite large, but the workers' wages are extremely low, and the income is only enough to make ends meet. As for all road construction costs, they are shared and recognized by various districts.</p>
<p>The road is incomparably straight, and the work is excellent. The route does not damage the rice fields. The roadbed of 200 miles is laid before plowing or after harvesting, which does not hinder the farmers' work. In September last autumn, the authorities planned to hire another 100,000 workers to dig ditches and build canals to process and build. It is planned to complete the 200-mile main line. The latest report said that 150,000 workers have been hired and started construction. It is estimated that it can be built to Tongzi in February, which is 150 miles away from Guiyang.</p>
<p>Everything depends on human effort. In March this year, several miles of first-class roads have been completed. The road is outside the city and is paved with gravel. Automobiles can drive on it at full speed, which is extremely smooth.</p>
<p>Inland transportation is blocked and inconvenient, and the border provinces feel particularly distressed. Automobiles are transported to Guizhou Province, transferred from Guangdong by barges and the vehicles themselves, and when passing through mountain paths and streams, they rely on manpower to carry them on their backs and shoulders, wading through deep water. It takes about 50 days to reach the destination. The difficulty of transportation and the inconvenience of transportation cannot be imagined by people in Shanghai, Beijing, or New York and London.</p>
<p>This was Guizhou two years ago, but now the situation has changed greatly. In these two years, progress has been rapid, roads have been added, and vehicles have increased. Now there are a total of 2,500 miles of roads in the province, and there are also 87 passenger and cargo vehicles and long-distance vehicles, most of which are General Motors vehicles. According to the plan of the Guizhou Road Construction Association, in the next two or three years, the restoration and improvement will be even more remarkable. The number of vehicles must be doubled.</p>
<h3>Fleet Utter Body Factory</h3>
<p>Li Jiren</p>
<p>The Largest Scale in the World</p>
<p>The Most Types of Bodies</p>
<p>Today's automobile industry is developing strangely and achieving remarkable results. All products of various factories hope to make large sales and implement specialization. Therefore, the crafts of various European and American countries today have special skills. In terms of the automobile industry, the manufacturing of a car is very complicated and must go through several manufacturers to supply each other before it can be made into a device. For example, the car factory specializes in manufacturing the body chassis, and the body has a special factory to undertake the construction. Each specializes in one field to refine its industry.</p>
<p>Most car body manufacturing experts have been builders of splendid carriages and fashionable sedans. Since the invention of automobiles, due to the relationship of interests and the trend of the times, they have all changed to manufacturing automobiles. Among the experts in car bodies, the most famous is the Fleet Utter Body Factory, which undertakes the construction of car bodies for the world's famous cars, such as Cadillac, Pike, Lincoln, etc. No matter how many orders can be built as needed, its wide range of business and the many types of car bodies are unparalleled.</p>
<p>The Fleet Utter Body Factory was first established in Benchevfer and Ash Forest. It seems that there is no hope of development. Suddenly, God blesses people. The forest in the area is solid in nature and suitable for manufacturing. Therefore, it has been valued and trusted by various automobile factories, and its business has increased day by day, and sales have become in short supply.</p>
<p>Detroit City is the address of its new factory. The location is set in the central, business-oriented city. All major factories are concentrated here. The car bodies of Cadillac and LaSalle produced by the General Motors Manufacturing Plant in the United States are manufactured by the Flotte Utter Factory.</p>
<p>The United States Loving Automobile Manufacturing Plant saw the rapid progress of the Fleet Utter Body Factory and the slight manufacturing method, and decided that it was necessary to join forces with it, so that the Cadillac Automobile Factory had the preparation for continuous supply and the guarantee of standard products.</p>
<p>Fleet Utter Body Factory has what it is today, from a small workshop to the world's largest car body factory. It is entirely dependent on the main force of the factory owner, Mr. Shibuler. The area of the Detroit New Factory is 1.5 million square feet and is worth 5 million U.S. dollars. According to Mr. Shi, the chassis equipped with the Fleet Utter body sells well, which has become the two major problems in the work. One is that the factory is not enough to use, and the other is the lack of skilled technicians. Now the new and old factories are expanding urgently and training urgently. The two will not become a problem.</p>
<p>Elegant cars have certain standards in style, manufacturing method and color. Car body builders must have skilled craftsmen to do it. They specialize in building one type of car body. If the craftsmanship is special and the work is excellent, all the manufacturing is unique and different from others.</p>
<p>The products of the Cadillac Automobile Factory have always been known for their accuracy and beauty. The car bodies made by Fleet Utter are also famous for their exquisite and solid. The work of the two factories is extremely careful, and the craftsmanship is extraordinarily delicate, so the beauty of their products is self-evident.</p>
<p>In 1929, the car bodies ordered by the Cadillac Automobile Factory from the Fleet Utter Body Factory were worth more than 1 million U.S. dollars. All custom-made car bodies are used for Cadillac and LaSalle chassis.</p>
<h3>The Past and Present of South China Roads: A Magnificent Sight</h3>
<p>Destruction is easy, but construction is difficult. The destruction and creation of all matter in the universe follow this general rule. Moreover, the fundamental undertakings of a nation, their creation is undoubtedly difficult. Our country has suffered frequent misfortunes and the people's livelihood has withered. Destruction has been repeated, but construction has been rarely seen. However, in the development of transportation and the implementation of road administration, considerable achievements have been made. This is not only a matter of self-congratulation for the Chinese people, but also a matter of praise from foreigners. Recently, when the National Road Association held its tenth anniversary celebration, it gave a detailed statistical report on the national roads and a detailed observation of the current state of road administration in the southern provinces. Now, it is heard that a certain member of the association has mentioned it, and the main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangxi: According to statistics, the national roads have now reached more than 84,700 li in length. They are suitable for motorcycle transportation, and the tracks of automobiles have appeared in most inland provinces. Although it is now a time of many troubles in various places, the progress of road works is still continuing. First, let's talk about Jiangxi Province. Two years ago, Nanchang, the provincial capital, was still a completely old-fashioned county town, with small lanes and alleys, chaotic and intricate, with no so-called roads. The name "automobile" was even unknown to most people. Now, it has been transformed into a new city where merchants gather. Wide roads and thoroughfares extend in all directions. The city walls, which were once relied upon for defense, have also been demolished and rebuilt into roads. There are more than 70 registered automobiles. As for the roads outside Nanchang, they are also very developed. All major cities now have stone paved roads connecting them to the provincial capital. Long-distance buses and trucks travel very smoothly. Currently, with a view to connecting major cities, there is still a plan for five major trunk roads, with an estimated cost of six million silver dollars.</p>
<p>Guangdong: Guangdong is the birthplace of the revolution. It always gets the head start in everything. The rapid advancement of road construction is truly the best among the provinces. Since 1922, the roads built have exceeded 7,000 li. The number of long-distance bus lines has therefore become increasingly dense. Automobile lines and service stations are spread throughout the province like stars in the sky, which also shows the prosperity of the trend.</p>
<p>Guangxi: In the final financial statement of Guangxi Province for 1929, the expenditure item with the largest amount was road construction expenses, about nearly three million silver dollars. This shows the rapid progress of road administration in Guangxi Province. The road expenditure budget for this year has been further increased. With ample financial resources, success will naturally be great. Recently, taking Nanning, the provincial capital, as an example, five years ago it was still a remote old city. Today, it has become the center of road lines between various large and small cities. After taking a bus from Nanning for only a few miles and ascending a mountain ridge, you will enter the avenue leading to various counties. All road lines are built according to new-style engineering and are quite practical. There are still many roads in the planning stage to connect various parts of the province and to provide access to other provinces.</p>
<p>Guizhou: Two years ago, road administration in Guizhou had not yet begun. In recent years, it has been making great progress. Last spring, 50,000 farmers were employed in the road construction work from Guiyang to the north and west to Anshun. The wages paid were very low, enough to cover the workers' food and a little more, supplied by the areas through which the road lines passed. The method was very fair. The selected routes were relatively straight and the slopes were not steep. The roadbed of more than 600 li from Anshun to Guiyang was mostly filled and built before planting crops. During the busy farming season, it was temporarily suspended and continued after the harvest. At that time, in order to achieve quick results, the local authorities planned to employ 100,000 workers to complete the roadbed work and culvert construction, so that automobiles could pass through this 600-li route in the spring of the following year. This spring, 150,000 workers have been working hard to achieve the goal of opening the road to Tongzi (about 450 li from Guiyang) in February. Indeed, where there is a will, there is a way. By early March, more than ten li of high-quality roads had been completed outside Guiyang City. Automobiles could travel smoothly at full speed. The first automobile was transported from Guangdong Province, transported by civilian ships and manpower, and arrived after five decades. The situation of this difficult transportation is probably unimaginable to the general public living in Pingjin and Shanghai. However, this was the situation two years ago. In these two years, as a result of the joint efforts of the government and the people, the number of road miles and the number of automobiles have increased significantly. Initially, there was only one automobile, but now it has increased to 87. The mileage of the roads will now advance to 2,500 li. The Chinese roads are primitive, but the achievements are excellent. Recently, the Guizhou Highway Bureau has also formulated an expansion plan. The progress of roads in the next two or three years is expected to double this number, which shows that the road administration in Guizhou Province is on the rise.</p>
<h3>Automobile Insurance by Lin Yingmei</h3>
<p>Recently, a new type of insurance called automobile insurance has been added to the insurance business. This has also arisen due to the needs of the times. This type of automobile insurance has not only been popular in European and American countries for a long time, but has also been considered an indispensable business in modern times. Various businesses in our country are more backward and immature than others. Automobile transportation is even less than one ten-thousandth of that in the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the term automobile insurance is still very new in our country. However, Shanghai, due to its geographical location, is the hub of Chinese and foreign trade, so it has its own special development. Moreover, the concession authorities spare no effort in managing municipal affairs and building flat and wide roads for high-speed vehicles to drive on, even at the expense of violating international treaties and building roads across borders. Therefore, the increase in the number of automobiles has been rapid. According to the statistics of the Public Concession at the end of January 1930, the total number of public and private automobiles, buses, and trucks registered and licensed in the concession was no less than 6,995. Therefore, the automobile insurance business in Shanghai has also emerged in response to the times. Those who operate this business are all foreign merchants, and most of them add a department to their existing insurance business to develop their business. Among them, the Baolong Insurance Company is the most energetic. The company's automobile insurance regulations are translated item by item as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If the body, headlights, tires, and other accessories are damaged due to the following reasons:</p>
<p>(A) Due to accidental negligence, resulting in collisions or overturning, or due to machine damage and long-term wear and tear, resulting in collisions or overturning.</p>
<p>(B) Fire, external explosions, natural burning, electric shock.</p>
<p>(C) Theft, being stolen.</p>
<p>(D) Acts of intentional destruction.</p>
<p>However, the company is not responsible for compensation if the tires are damaged not at the same time as the vehicle. In the event of theft or being stolen, the insured must first bear the loss fee of ten taels.</p>
<p>(2) If the body, headlights, tires, and other accessories are damaged during road, railway, waterway, or elevator transportation, the company is not responsible for compensation if the tires are damaged not at the same time as the vehicle. Written approval from the company must be obtained each time for it to be valid, and the insured must first bear the loss fee of ten taels.</p>
<p>(3) If the vehicle is damaged midway and needs to be repaired nearby, the company is responsible for the protection fee and transportation fee.</p>
<p>(4) If the insured himself or other passengers (excluding the insured's employees) suffer physical injury due to the vehicle's negligence, the company will bear the corresponding medical expenses, but not exceeding one hundred taels each time.</p>
<p>(5) If a traffic accident occurs causing death or injury (not the insured's family members or drivers), the company is legally obligated to pay compensation.</p>
<p>(6) If a traffic accident occurs damaging the property of others (including animals), the company is legally obligated to pay compensation. However, the property owned, managed, or transported in the vehicle by the insured himself is not included in this example.</p>
<p>(7) If the insured drives a non-personally owned private automobile and causes an accident, the company is legally obligated to pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 above, provided that the vehicle referred to in this policy was not being used at the same time.</p>
<p>(8) If the insured's relatives and friends, with the insured's consent, drive the vehicle referred to in this policy and cause an accident, the company is also legally obligated to pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 above. If death, injury, or damage occurs, the company, with the company's written consent, is further obligated to defend and bear all expenses. However, the extent of the company's obligations shall not exceed 20,000 taels each time in accordance with the provisions of Articles 5, 6, 7, and 8 above, including compensation fees, litigation fees, and all other expenses.</p>
<p>(9) If the vehicle is damaged, the insured may repair it at any time, but attention must be paid to the following three points: (A) The estimated repair cost must not exceed 50 taels. (B) The estimated repair cost must be listed in detail in accordance with the format set by the company and submitted to the company for review. (C) The insured must clearly prove the necessity of the repair and the fairness of the price.</p>
<p>(10) In the event of a major accident, the company may voluntarily represent the insured in court to answer questions. In addition, if the insured or his authorized representative is suspected of violating regulations while driving the vehicle, the company may be responsible for the defense. The company is not responsible for compensation in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>A. The insured admits liability or admits compensation without the company's written permission.</p>
<p>B. Loss or depreciation of the vehicle or loss of use due to the above circumstances.</p>
<p>C. Damage due to long-term wear and tear or damage from pests and frost. D. Machine breakage or damage, except for collisions or overturning due to accidental negligence.</p>
<p>E. Loss or damage due to competition, racing, credit testing, speed testing, rental, cargo transportation, or other non-private or business uses.</p>
<p>F. Loss or damage due to hurricanes, floods, heavy rain, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and other natural disasters, or due to the actions of enemy countries and wars or similar war actions (whether before or after the declaration of war), or due to strikes, riots, civil strife, rebellions, armed usurpation, or indirectly or directly, from near or far, affected by the above events. However, this example does not apply if the insured can prove that it was not caused by the above reasons.</p>
<p>G. Loss or damage outside the borders of China, unless otherwise specified.</p>

<h3>Chatting with the Automobile King by Huang Yingdai</h3>
<p>Holding a Wedding Anniversary: We recall that 42 years ago, in the area of ​​Lao'ai, there was a man named William Ford, who was the son of Henry Ford, today's American Automobile King. He held a wedding ceremony with a farmer's daughter. Ford's wife was Miss Clara Bryant. Before the marriage, the couple made a joint vow on the grass outside Lao'ai. On the wedding day, a pastor from St. Paul's Church in Clinton officiated the ceremony. At that time, Ford was 25 years old and his wife was 21 years old. On April 11th of this year, the Ford couple held a 42nd wedding anniversary in Lao'ai. Moreover, that day was also Mrs. Ford's birthday. Automobile industry figures and military and political dignitaries from all over the United States all went to Lao'ai to congratulate the Ford couple. The various lively scenes are self-evident. The Ford couple held the anniversary at Fairlane, where the couple only had a small amount of farmland at the time, but now it has thousands of acres. Speaking of the Ford couple's marriage, Ford first met Bryant at a dance hall in Clinton. Through an introduction, they met each other. Ford was immediately infatuated with Bryant at first sight, and the buds of love sprouted from this. At that time, although Ford was interested in Bryant, Bryant did not pay attention to Ford. After a year, they met again at a second dance. The two began to talk affectionately. After Bryant returned home, she told her parents that Ford was an unusual young man, with a handsome appearance and a gentle disposition, which was unmatched by others. And at the second dance, Ford paid even more attention to her. From then on, the two were often seen walking hand in hand and whispering on the grass. After two years, Ford's father divided some farmland to Ford, and Ford married Bryant. After Ford got married, he worked hard and later engaged in the automobile business, and today he has become an automobile king. His wife's assistance was also not small. Therefore, the Ford couple still maintains a harmonious relationship to this day.</p>
<p>Donating funds to establish schools: Ford is a</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>Ford is generous in nature. He always tries his best to donate to various charitable causes. His only wish in his life is to donate 10,000 gold yuan to educational institutions. He has also donated millions of gold yuan to Georgetown to engage in education. There is a school on Georgetown that admits both boys and girls, which was founded by a woman. After receiving a huge donation from Ford, she was able to expand the school. This matter was about 28 years ago. The Ford couple donated 1 million gold yuan to Principal Bailey, and the Corley School has since developed day by day. However, before the donation, there was only one school building and the number of students was only five. But now it has reached a thousand people. The students in the school pay special attention to vocational aspects, and Ford also tries his best to pay attention to and promote it. Recalling five years ago, Ms. Bailey received Ford's first donation. In a certain month of 1924, the Ford couple visited Bailey School and learned that the students in the school had no holidays in 365 days of the year. They were in school every day, and at least worked 166 hours a week. The method was excellent. One day, when the Ford couple were dining at the school, Mrs. Ford suggested visiting the kitchen. The next morning, Ford sent a letter to Ms. Bailey, stating that he was willing to donate 300,000 gold yuan to build a kitchen for the school using the GOTEIO construction method, with complete equipment inside. Since then, the Ford couple have visited the school frequently, and now they have become regular visitors. Therefore, at the foot of Georgetown, we often see Ford's private car parked there, at least once a week. Ford has donated to build four buildings in the school, namely the dining hall, the women's dormitory, the auditorium, and the health room. Various buildings are built using the British GOTHIC method, which is strong and durable. There is nothing like it. The houses are majestic on the top of the mountain. Today, Bailey School has been divided into three departments, namely junior middle school, and boys' and girls' elementary schools. Among them, the girls' elementary school was established with Ford's private donation.</p>

<h3>Introduction to the Baoan Constant Speed Machine</h3>
<p>I have investigated the causes of automobile accidents. Although some blame the pedestrians, most accidents are caused by drivers speeding. Mr. Chen Bingjun of Yunfei Automobile Company has a lot of experience in automobile engineering. Recently, he invented a constant speed machine, which is installed in the middle of the oil inlet pipe and the carburetor. Just screw in the "fast" screw and screw out the "slow" screw, and you can get the desired speed limit. The procedure is very simple. Car owners who want to avoid accidental danger, reduce major repair costs, save oil, tires, and braking, and extend the life of various parts of the machine should not be without one. I especially hope that all taxi companies adopt it.</p>
