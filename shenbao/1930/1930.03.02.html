<p>時評</p>
<h3>◎金價又飛漲</h3>
<p>金價昨日竟飛漲至五百十九兩五錢。而以五百十七兩九錢收盤。實爲亘古未有之高價。說者謂印度徵收生銀進口稅。爲此次標金飛漲之一原因。蓋印度一方面徵收生銀進口稅。一方面對出口之銀。將所徵收之稅完全發還。可見其急欲將剩餘之銀。力向外推世界多銀之國。若皆有此種情勢。則銀巿自然益見擁擠。必有不堪收拾之一日。而爲尾閭之我國。當更受其影響矣。</p>
<p>美國耶魯大學著名經濟學敎授費歇氏。最近曾發表意見。謂世界現金。漸有不敷供給經濟需要之象。若不設法施行國際管理流通與生產方法。則三年之内或稍久。必有一日不敷周轉。商業停歇。物價潰落。引起世界恐慌云云。可見今日世界。現銀日趨壅滯。現金日見缺少。兩方有此大相反背之情勢。則銀落金漲。乃自然之結果。其於商業。各國皆受影響。倘非各國合力以謀挽救。則此奔騰而至一瀉千里之巨潮。决無倖免者矣。</p>
<p>至受颢響最大之我國。今日急須從事實上謀所以補救之法。尤須從各方面。切實研究可以實行之方法。而勿空言提倡國貨。勿空寄希望於渺不可知之事業。以補救銀賤方面言。例如徵抽生銀進口稅。有人謂可照印度方法變通施行者。然亦有人謂徵收銀稅。於我國亦有不利者。此則須經深明經濟學原理者。詳細研求。方可定施行與否之標準。以補救金貴方面言。例如開礦一事。我國亦非無可開之金礦。然人所以不民貿然倡導者。以其無把握故也。此則又須有專家詳切調查其成分。計劃其費用與方法。必有確實把握。始可舉行凡此之類皆非空言所能收效。又非門外漢所敢妄談。故我深望我國人。切實從事實上着想。而勿嘵嘵費詞。仍無絲毫之結果也。</p>

<h3>印度新預算案</h3>
<p>增加進口棉貨稅</p>
<p>引起日人之反感</p>
<p>▲路透社二十八日新德里電印度行政會議財政議員許斯德爵士在立法會提出增加棉貨稅之預算案時、發表言論、顯含經濟自主爲印度憲法一部份、雖印度稅率變更、妨及英人利益、然英政府儘可交涉與請求而已之意、爵士謂英政府曾電</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>致印度政府、考慮英國因印度增收貨稅而受之嚴理影響、並聲明英政府確知此種影響、非印度政府成立法會有意致之印政府旋答覆之、表示深切同情、惟聲明首當注重者、厥爲印度利益、同時印度在政治觀念上深知顧及英人輿情之重要、故印政府建議、凡進口棉貨非英國製造者、另加保護稅百分之五、此爲印政府建議、至於最後决議、則立法會實操其權、此項議案或將引起許多批評、但印政府</p>
<p>▲路透社一日大阪電此間對於印度預算案擬增收棉貨稅之消息、極爲注重、因所擬稅則、較一般人所預料者爲高也、衆視此爲對於日本貿易之甚重大打擊、而手織原色布每磅徵收從量稅至少三安那半、（印幣名）一條、尤爲日人所不滿、以此</p>
<p>乃對日貨而施也、此間棉布廠商以爲印政府此種提議、與大阪英領事近所唱英日在疋頭巿塲中善意諒解之議、精神完全相反、東洋棉紡公司副總理今晨聲稱、印度爲增進收入起見、將棉貨進口稅由百分之十一增至百分之十五、渠對之未便批評、惟原色手布用乃輸入印度之日本主要貨物、今欲徵收從量稅、則不啻禁其入口、此種提議、可謂暴虐云、</p>
<p>歡迎極詳審之指摘、印政府希望立法會以鎭靜與公允之精神、予以决議云、按上述預算案、擬增進口棉布稅、由百分之十一进爲百分之十五、而非英貨、則另徵保護稅百分之五、以三年爲期、現銀進口每盎斯徵稅四安那、（印幣名）</p>

<h3>日本選舉潮之餘波</h3>
<p>大衆黨主張總選舉無效</p>
<p>武藤山治被控</p>
<p>▲電通社一日東京電日本磊衆黨、主張二月二十日之總選舉爲無效、其理由係以總選舉日、應從解散當日起算、於三十日以内、選定一日、若此次總選舉、從解散當日起算、即二月二十日、恰爲第三十一日、應作無效、但司法内務兩省、均以二月二十日係依法律解釋、從翌日起算者、故不成問題、然全國農民組合、則主張民法解釋與普通選舉法不同云、總之此事不會成爲問題、然爲有興味之解釋法、</p>
<p>▲電通社一日東京電東京朝日新聞本日論此次總選舉政友會之失敗曰、因選舉失敗、政友會有發生内訌之勢、此後之政友會更生乎抑逆轉於全權乎、犬養總裁提其老軀、南船北馬、席不睱暖、意誠可感、然徒恃演說、不能取得柰數、蓋現在之政友會、實有統制不定之感、犬養總裁、雖有勇氣、然無統制、决難取勝、選舉委員以及公認候補之發表、均欠敏活、各地又有持犬養系床次系鈐木系名片之候補者、宮崎縣因床次系與鈐木系對立、致公認候補、遲遲不决、遂使此優勢之地盤、定額五名之中、竟被民政黨奪去四名、此後非一新幹部組織樹立新政策以謀復興不可、岡琦之中老等、亦非隱忍自重、選任總裁後任之適任者不可云、</p>
<p>▲電通社一日大阪電昨日有人在大阪檢事局、控武藤山治曾於選舉前、有饗宴之事、當局即着手調查、名義人係某巡查部長、但係假名、大阪警察部長、深信武藤無違反選舉之事、然因時節關係、頗喚起世人注意、</p>
<h3>倫敦巿塲銀價大跌</h3>

<p>▲路透社二十八日倫敦電今日倫敦巿塲錫價大跌、每噸現售一六八鎊一先令三便士、此爲一九二二年以後之最低價格、查一九二二年間最低錫價爲一三九鎊、</p>

<p>▲國民社二十八日芝加哥電此間警察當道、派嗣闫索各共產黨機關、結果搜得證書多件、希圖集合各過激黨於三月六日、同在歐美各地舉事、此項舉動、殆爲莫斯科第三國際之所主使、日前芝加哥洛斯安琪爾司及美國其他城鎭、同時有共產黨結隊游行、大約即預定大舉之先聲、而據華盛頓法部人員聲稱、該部久已劉意此輩之活動、然確信其能爲云、</p>

<h3>昨開全市代表大會</h3>
<p>上午舉行開幕典禮</p>
<p>下午選出執監委員</p>
<p>中國國民黨上海特别市第六次全市代表大會、昨晨九時、舉行開幕典禮、到中央代表褚民誼·監選員吳保豐·警備司令部代表賴參謀長·市政府代表兪鴻鈞·本届執監委員熊式輝等、曁全市代表共百數十人茲將詳情分誌如次、</p>
<p>大會職員主席團陳德徵·范爭波·潘公展·熊式輝、（以上由市執委會推舉）吳開先·童行白·楊淸源·王延松·陳君毅、（以上由大會推舉）秘書長陶百川·速記許性初·黄香谷、</p>
<p>主席報告由主席陳德徵報告、其詞如下、中央代表·各位同志·各位來賓、今天我們來舉行第六次全市代表大會、我們記得去年比今年要早二十天的樣子、舉行第五次全市代表大會、我們也記得、去年今天也就是第五次全市代表大會所選舉出來的執行委員會監察委員會開始辦公的日子、所以今天這一個日子、在本市黨部方面看起來、覺得是很値得紀念的、在這個很値得紀念的日子、來舉行第六次全市代表大會、當然是非常適當而且很有意義、我們以曉得今天第三届中央執行委員會、在首都召集第三次全體會議、關於全國的大計及戡亂的方針、在第三次中央全體會議中一定有委好的决定、我們想到了中央的努力、覺得我們的努力也應當追隨中央諸領袖之後、共同來奪勉、因此今天舉行第六次全市代表大會、越覺得有意義、我們回想過去一年中的工作、曉得工作的步驟、及平日所有的成績、與四週的環境、是很有關係的所以在没有講一年的工作之前、先要把過去一年所處的環境約略說一說、去年自編遣會議閉幕以後、惹起了一般反動軍人的忌恨、更引起了這一般反動軍人的陰謀底暴露、所以接二連三的有了反動軍人的叛變、最初有桂系軍閥的叛亂、而後有張發奎及馮玉祥的叛亂、後來又有唐生智的叛亂、到了如今、殘餘的封建勢力所擁護的殘餘軍閥、又想在那裏擾亂中國搖動民族的基礎已經很明顯的叛變的言論與行動的事實昭告出來這是大家很明白的了、所以就過云一年中的環境仔細來一看、可以說三分之二的時間、是被反動軍閥的叛變所籠罩住、本來中央所確定了很好的訓民以政的計劃、那裏知道因反動軍人的叛亂、就把中央的整個計劃、打得粉碎、我們想起過去一年中的環境、實在覺得非常痛心、除了反動軍人的叛變以外、還有一點事情、也很値得注意的就是有一般無聯學者、不斷地在無的放失的詆毁本黨破壞革命、希圖搖動民衆對本黨的信仰、譬如胡適、就是其中的代表者、這種思想上的反動、和軍人在政治上的反動、他們對民族的損害、是一樣的、反動也佔了一部分、除了軍人的叛變與思想上的反動以外、還有關於内國經濟的狀况也非常値得我們注意、最近本市有許多廠家、完全關了門、其餘許多實業、也幾乎已屋宜告破産的狀態又因爲中國至今、還是用銀本位、而且元兩並用没有一個標本的準則、所以到了金貴銀賤風潮發生的時候、國内經濟方面、受到很大的損害、形成了經濟困難使全市同志、感到很大的警惕、這也可以說去年環境中的一部分、所以過去一年中的環境、我們可以總括爲第一、在政治上有反動軍人的叛變與搗亂、第二、在思想上有無恥學者的破壞壞與陰謀第三、在經濟上有很大危機的潛伏、由這三種環境、我們可以看出我們的工作、大部分都是用在這三種方面、在政治上、我們用了全力、在中央領導之下作戡亂的工夫、在思想上、我們也用全力、來斬除思想上的亂源在經濟上、我們曾用了很大的力量、來帮助政府、切實來救經濟困難、我們過去一年來的工作、因着環境的關係僅僅祇做了消極方面的三大部分、因爲這樣、所以使同志間的親愛精誠、不能有良好的訓練、所以使同志間的學識、不能有良好的切磋、所以使同志的行動、不能有良好的監督、所以使同志間的思想不能有良好的交換、所以過去一年中、同志間發生許多顯然的缺憾、雖然、大家有了共信、但是對於互信方面、還没有良好的修養、這是過去事實、所告訴我們的、現在回憶起來、實在非常痛心、同時我們也覺察過去一年中、有一小部分的同志、不顧個人的氣節廉恥、而做出許多不應當做的事情、這一點使我們回憶起來、覺得非常難過其次在屢次叛變中、也找出一個缺點、就是同志太急躁、缺乏忍耐心、不能鎭靜地來、應付種種事情、這也是一個很大的缺點、還有一點、就是有一小部分的同志、祇顧個人的自由、而忽略了全黨的自由、因此發生了許多違犯紀律的事、最普遍的、就有二個毛病、第一、是同志間的行動太浪漫第二、是思想行爲太幼稚、因爲行動的浪費、致引起一般民衆的懷疑和反感、因爲思想的幼稚、所以有許多事情、或者做得太過分、或者還没有做得好、這許多過去的缺憾、在今天想起來、實在使我們警惕不少、我們要從過去的回憶中想出今後的辦法、這是今天大會應得考量和研究的所以在開會之前、兄弟特提出幾點、供各位參考、第一、我們想到的就是氣節的問題、如果一個革命黨不能以氣節廉恥爲立黨的前提、黨的基礎、就不能穏固、民族的基礎也就要搖動、中國人向來是講廉恥的、可是近年來、因爲共産黨的挑撥離間和煽亂、致將氣節廉恥損失無餘、現在我們要把這一件實貝、重行接收起來、我們要對於氣節廉恥有好好修養、我們可以說寗可殺身成仁、千萬不可貪生而隳志這是第一點、第二點、我們想起來、有二句很重要話、這二句話、不但市執委同人時常互相勉勵、就上全市同志、也應當時常勉勵就是、臨財毌苟得、臨難毌苟免、如果我們能殺照此二句話互相自勉、一個同志如此、個個同志如此、那麽黨的基礎、無論如何不會被人搖動、革命前途、也非常有希望第三點、我們想起來、是同志學識的修養、我們曉得讀書應當不忘革命、革命當應當有很好的學問、如果一個革命黨没有學問、就會變爲草包、專門從事搗亂不能擔負大的革命責任、此後我們要爲革命而努力學問、這二點、都是關於同志之間的、至於黨的方面、如我們應當在中央領導之下、來根本消滅一切封建勢力餘孽的反叛者、再如應當積極從事政治的建設、至於一切政治上的建設、及本黨理論的探討、主義的研究宣傳、及實施以及黨的組織之嚴密、過去已經很努力的做、今後我們更應當努力的做、在第六次全市代表大會開會的時候、我們的感想很多、難遇也增加許多、我們感覺得過去環境的困難、祇有一點値得告慰的、就是我們的工作、還比較努力、不遇許多缺點的地方、以及許多實際上的困難、都要待於今天大會的商量和解决、我們在很高興之中、謹以誠懇的意思、謹祝第六次全市代表大會順利、謹祝第六次全市代表大會能毅得到圓滿的結果、完了、</p>
<p>中央訓詞中央代表褚民誼訓詞、主席團、各位代表、今天兄弟代表中央、前來參加本市第六次全市代表大會、很覺欣幸、我們曉得、市代表大會、是全市黨的最高的機關、於今本市各區代表總計六十五人人、到會的已有六十四人、差不多是全體的了、足證各位同志對黨的熱心和明白、自已的責任、各位代表自是各區的優秀份子、也可說本市各界的代表、較之去年五次代表大會、覺得更有進步了、我們應當檢閲過去的工作、如果發現有錯誤的地方、當設法予以矯正、更須考量、現在的環境、從積極方面計　我們將來的工作、庶幾下届的執監委員有所遵循、至於選舉下届的執監委員、我們更當　密的考察、必須選舉能負責的同志來充任、那麽日後的黨務、自有更良好的成績、現在反動份子蠢然思動、正是我們奪鬥的機會、希望各位同志能明白自已重大的責任、而努力爲之、</p>

<h3>日輪巴陵丸觸礁</h3>
<p>旅客全部救出</p>
<p>日淸汽船會社粤滬津班輪巴陵丸、於前日即（上月二十八日）、突在汕頭東海面、因遇大霧觸礁、船中進水、貨物全損、茲將詳細情形、分誌如下、</p>
<p>觸礁之地點查巴陵丸輪、（載重二千餘噸）今次由上海赴粤、係在二月十九日離滬、因途中連遇霧露三次、故直至二十八日上午九時、該輪方到汕頭東面南澳島海面、其時霧露甚大、對面莫辨、而巴陵丸輪、於大霧中、誤走航綫、乃觸入南澳島之暗礁石上、頭艙爲礁石所觸、船底洞破、海水即汩汩浸入船中、</p>
<p>船艙之破損船上所載旅客甚多、第一次頭艙觸破後、船身釀成頭沉尾高之勢、形勢十分危險、因之船在海中、失却平泊之力船身將有覆没之懼、船主乃大驚、爲求全輪之生命安全起見、乃令司機開足馬力、復再向前方之礁石上撞去、而第二艙又爲撞破、一二兩艙進水後、船身稍平、危機亦略略减少也、</p>
<p>海盜之謀刦汕頭南澳島附近、本爲海盜出没之處、常有發生刦掠商船之事、巴陵丸失事後、聞即有盜船多艘謀刦、巴陵丸輪船主、急發出求救警信、當時首先得到信號者爲駐汕頭之日本驅逐艦柿號、立即飛駛至南澳局保護該輪、以防海盜刦掠、</p>
<p>旅客之獲救巴陵丸輪中之旅客、在船身觸樵以後、恐慌萬狀、羣集甲板、號泣者有之、謀登　板划子、　逃者有之、搶救命圈者有之、幸該社南華班輪廬山丸、在途接得日軍艦代發之無綫電、遂駛往南澳島、立放小舢板、於昨晨、將巴陵船中旅客、完全救上本輪、遂無傷害人命之事</p>
<p>總社之施救上海總社、接得日艦代發無綫電、即由該社社長、命駐滬總船主竹下氏、於昨日帶同大批工人、及拖救輪船應需之抽水機器·及木桶·水泥等等、已於昨日乘某英輪逕赴汕頭至南澳察勘、以備施救、昨日、滬社又發專電至自廣東來滬之嵩山丸輪、着其速赴南澳島任拖救該輪之責矣、</p>
<p>貨物之損失此次巴陵丸中、在　　滬裝得滿船出口貨到廣東、其中以生仁·石膏·生餅·等爲多、而至厦門貨、僅有粉一百袋、已經卸去、餘貨悉在船内、今一二兩艙、已全浸水、各貨亦已完全在水内、且各貨盡係華商所裝者、損失額至爲巨大也、</p>

<p>自飛虎失事一案發生、本埠各保險公司、即發函與各輪公司、大致謂、承保水險之各商輪、若開行商班、則普通保險、自有效力、若該輪現在裝兵、而未加保扣船險者、則普通保單便失去效力、即使發生事故、亦必發生糾紛、着令現在之運兵船、速保扣船險矣、</p>

<h3>付之一笑</h3>

<p>父（突然的聞入室中）——　。</p>
<p>你在這裏幹甚麽。</p>
<p>子——我正在把一段故事講給王小姐聽。</p>
<p>父——爲甚麽頭並頭肩並肩的𧞓緊在一起。你的手又摟着伊的腰呢。</p>
<p>子——因爲我所講的是一段戀愛的故事。</p>

<h3>大學多</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>胡圖先生問曰。大學者造就人才之府也。古謂九年大成。今則專門畢業。中國日言建設。正患人材之少。豈慮大學之多。如今口號三多。兵多。匪多。與大學多而三。豈大學不應多乎。盟柏子曰。非此之謂也。所惡乎大學者。謂其多搭漿也。謂其多蹩脚也。謂其多野鷄也。胡圖先生曰。此眞不說還明白。越說越糊塗矣。我所問者大學之量。君所說者則大學之質也。質不良則改之。野鷄可改而不野鷄。推之搭漿蹩脚皆然。何得遷怒於量凑三多之數。伍於兵匪。猥曰大學多乎。凡事必求辦法。如兵多則編遣。今不將編遣大學乎。匪多則剿辦。今不將剿辦大學乎。明柏子曰。非此之謂也。凡物以稀爲貴。多則黄蘆白華。彌望皆同。不可貴而可賤焉。請以以國初之勳章譬之。嘉禾章之初制也。榮典賞勳。何等尊重。如一批數十兩批數百。當時號爲勳章雨。惡其多耳。故不得已。救而濟之。特而别之。續定一種寳光嘉禾章焉。且限而制之。區而等之。並定大綬之寳光章焉。誠以勳章。類推大學。則思過半矣。胡圖先生曰。尊論仍不足以解吾惑。昔者勳章雨。今不過大學雨耳。救而濟之。特而别之。亦定一種寳光大學可也。且限而别之。區而等之。並定爲寳光大綬大學亦可也。大學者。學之大也。有總比無好。多總比少好。大學多則人才多。人才多則建設多。吾日祝大學之多於兵與匪也。如之何其惡大學多也。盟柏子艴然不答。自由翁曰。盟柏之見。固極明白。胡圖之言。亦未必果糊塗。君子多乎哉不多也。何必爭多。禮有以多爲貴者。又何必不爭多。吾曹均門外漢。母多言。多言多敗。請錄問答。介自由談。以質敎育專家。何如。</p>
<h3>福煦立像地點難覓</h3>
<p>— 柳枝</p>
<p>說起法國的福煦上將。誰都要油然起景仰之心他是歐洲大戰中的權威。協約軍隊裏的靈魂。誠然。這是二十世紀民治主義進攻君主獨裁之戰。勝利當然屬於前者。惟是。如果没有福煦上將的天才和毅力。那末。這傳統的霍海查倫的氣熖。怕未必就能在一九一八年平壓下去罷。所以巴黎的民衆。早有心要替他立一個像。一面表示他們崇拜英雄的熱忱。一面也可以給後世多留一個憑弟的所在。因此。前内閣鮑因卡勒。Poincare特地組織一個委員會。斟酌這事的進行。但是爲立像的地點問題。竟引起一塲爭執。最初。委員會圈定了卡伯伊雷賽司大街ChampoEiysees的中心。因爲這是巴黎最熱閙之區。萬民麕集。易於瞻曕仰。况且。戰勝紀念碑和無名英雄墓。也在那裏。上將的騎馬像。加入其間。鼎足而三。越見得相暎成趣了。不料輿論界。一致反對這個計劃。據說卡伯伊雷賽司街司街之美。全恃遠景。爲之掩暎烘托。要是上將又高又大的彫像。立在中間。這條大街的美觀。未免要减色了。有一位記者。更打趣地說道。「我們福煦上將戎裝躍馬的彫像。倘若眞的要立在這閙市中間。那末簡直像一個馬差巡捕。終朝張着眼在那裏指揮來往的車輛了」。然而。除此之外。偌大巴黎。竟找不出可以適宜安置這位大英雄像的地方。這處嫌其樹木太多。那處嫌其離城太遠。結果。反成了一個難解决的問題。這暗噁叱咤的福煦上將的彫像暫時還不能與世人相見咧。</p>
<h3>皖南道中之怪盜</h3>
<p>— 春華</p>
<p>在吾家田産未售出以前。鄒姓老佃農年必一蒞吾家。除結賬外。並常以鄉里土産見餽。吾儕幼時即深愛其人。迨長。以田園易主。鄒亦衰老日甚。留居鄉中。不甚外出。市榖結算之役。悉由其子任之。而其子固絶足不至吾家也。日昨。鄒老忽婆娑而至。健談談輿猶昔。於吾家衰頽之象。頗致惋昬惜。且勉勵吾儕。迅爲規復祖業之計。繼談及里中盜患。彼復太息於官兵之無能。並自述其此次由里來京。途中曾値一盜。蓋自里中至大通。有旱道二百餘里。鄒老壯年。能以三日爲往返之期。近雖老。而仍健步。又以未得同伴。踽踽獨行。過靑陽未久。於道旁樹下。見有一人坐而休息。遙呼鄒曰。老翁得母將往大通去乎。鄒唯唯。彼乃自陳係某茶行採貨之商夥。顧與偕行。鄒不虞有他。同行約十餘里。洎一荒寒之尖原。彼遽自身畔出一短刃。向鄒威嚇。鄒驚出其囊資。約百餘元。係鄕人託其在京備辦貸物者。盜略加檢點。僅取二十元。餘悉還鄒。曰。觀翁狀。似亦貧窶之夫。吾得二十元已足。餘資翁自將去可耳。鄒方感謝。盜又怒目言曰。金錢姑畀爾。惟衣物須留下。我輩窮弟兄。望此絮袍不知幾何歲月。翁得錢可另製。其勿吝此。鄒哀言其老而怯寒。盜大喝。撲鄒於地。强裭其衣。鄒隨身所携之包裏亦被刦去。臨行。又還鄒五元曰。此以償翁衣値。想差足矣。鄒云。其人年事似尙輕。容貌亦殊淸秀。不知其何以屈身爲盜。爲盜而於金錢又復淡然若是。誠足怪也。</p>
<h3>遇着了拆白黨</h3>
<p>— 羽盦</p>
<p>二月二十六日上午。衍慶里第五弄第五家發生一可笑可憐之事。先是有男女二人。僦居於此。人皆以爲夫婦。而不知其爲非法結合。尤不知男者乃屬於拆白一流也。其生活頗奢。女年在花信左右。男則似無恒業。是日忽遷居。而已在數日前賃定某處房屋以箱籠物件甚多。男特往某搬場公司僱一搬場汽車。運載家具。經數小時之忙碌。一切貴重物件。欣聞已裝上汽車。將開赴新居去矣。男子忽縐眉呼腹痛且劇。不能舉步。女驚詢之男曰無妨。速爲我購一元煙膏來。吸之當立愈。女如言往購。及返。則人車皆杳訝甚。以爲腹痛已止。不待其返。先赴新居去也。然中心亦爲之驚疑不定。坌息至新居。則雙扉緊閉。寂無人聲。不似有人遷居。叩其門而入。問二房東曾否有人來。曰未也。乃姑待之。良久。仍不見搬場汽車開至。料知有異。更返至衍慶里。問看門巡捕。曾見有洗車開出此里否。巡捕曰。有之。然開出久矣。女曰。所載何物巡捕曰。載物甚多。余猶憶其爲大世界附近一搬場公司之搬場汽車也。女不禁玉容失色。即又奔赴大世界附近。尋得一㮽場公司。問今天衍慶里第五弄第五家搬場。僱有搬場公司汽車。其爲貴公司所承僱乎。不知將第五家之家具。載赴何地。某公司不承。曰。本公司未受衍慶里僱用。所僱者。當爲別家公司之汽車也。女無奈。仍回故居。則已餘空房一所。衣服金錢。盡爲男者綑載以去。目前生活。即非常困難。無食宿之地。雖欲留住故居。亦不可得。吁。誠可憐而雙可笑矣。上海爲萬惡之藪。此等事件。殊不足奇。作寓同福里時。曾見鄰家女子背棄男子。捲其所有而逃。損失甚巨。人謂之放白鴿。似亦嘗記刋本報。今寓衍慶里。又遘此拆白黨。據此女涕泣語人。結合已數年。所有積蓄。耗去什九。餘者亦附上汽車而去。衣服家具。蓋猶值數百金。冤哉。吾不知上海竟有多少癡男女。爲異性所給非演至最後一幕。不能覺悟也。曰可憐可笑。實不足以幸災樂禍。</p>
<h3>佛展參觀記</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>吾友化佛。秉諷世厲俗之才。藉毛錐之力。窮思冥索。發大宏願。有萬佛樓供養之志。自近年脫離粉墨生活以還閉門靜習。矻矻終年。日惟揮毫寫佛。莊嚴妙相。氣象萬千。前假靜安寺路世界道德會大廳。公開展覽。陳列傑作於一堂。會場售新刮之化佛造像手冊。古色古香。名人題詠。靡足見珍。寓宣揚佛法旨趣於丹青之中。而爲藝術界放一異彩。</p>
<p>聞化佛今風將有南洋之行。弔釋迦牟尼之塋於錫蘭。訪佛敎發祥地於印度。窮源探奧。挾其勇於爲善之胸懷。百折不撓之毅力。以德化人。以誠處事。其堅忍不拔之精神。終有大成之一日。觀感所及。因濡筆而爲之記。</p>
<h3>吃的常識</h3>
<p>— 𨓜梅</p>
<p>鱘鰉世魚也。一名鱣。俗稱著甲。長一二丈。無鱗。背有骨甲。口近頷下。有觸鬚。脂肉俱爲黃色/產江河及深水中。可與豚肉同煑。味絕腴美。吳中菜館雅善爲之。故小說家許指嚴氏頗嗜是物。每游吳中。輒以鱘鰉佐酒。然是物不可與牛乳同食。食則凝滯不能消化。有礙衛生。體育家馮子平君。自恃頑健。不之信。一日。竟盡鱘鰉一簋。牛乳一器。食畢而睡。夜半痛如絞。從此委頓者月餘。始漸健適。一昨子平來書。述及近狀。因記之如此。以告世之老饕。母再貽此戚也。按食品中往往有二物相忌。不能同進。如螃蟹之與柿黃瓜之與落花生。糯米之與牛脯。同食之致病或竟死。究屬何故。殊不易解也。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（一三七）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第九回諸名士鬧笑捉迷藏一嬌娘任情施擁護　　可是伊也有些不敢得罪蕊雲。伊一面要在伊的身上發一票財。一面也就只好鬼拍馬屁。只要不累及伊的營業。也就馬馬虎虎了。原來大姨還有一個姘頭。伊借了人家一間樓面做小房子。每天到十二點鐘的時候。就要回去。和伊的老姘頭窩心去了。伊見他們打小牌。表面上也很贊成。伊說蠻好蠻好。你們弄弄白相相。但是不要太晏。頂多打八圈。不然。二少回去也太晏了。又關照阿囡弗要嘸清嘸頭。繞死弗淸呀。大阿姨去了以後。全是蕊雲的世界了。左詩晨和他們打牌。全是敷衍他們。換一句話說。全是敷衍蕊雲的。那時詩晨是一個。蕊雲是一個。阿金是一個。只有三個人。有時去拉小阿姨。小阿姨也喜歡打牌。不過蕊雲不歡迎伊。因爲伊有點像煞有介事。擺出長輩的面孔來。小阿姨有個餋女。名字喚做含雲。年紀比蕊雲大一歲。便敎伊來坐一脚。四個人可以成局了。但是含雲常常不肯來。說是没有錢。蕊雲便撅起了嘴唇。說你不來是拆散塲子了。三缺一。喪陰駡。詩晨便低低向含雲道。你來好了。輸了算我的。贏了算你的。但是這個話。不能使蕊雲知道。這時左詩晨的心理。完全是一種哄孩子的心理。意思是要使那個小孩子心裏歡喜。也便是自已心裏歡喜。有時知道蕊雲是一副大牌。或者明顯的是在那裏做一色。却故意的發出一張伊要的牌來。及至發出了以後。又故意做出懊悔的樣子。連忙要想收回來。却已被蕊雲一把抓住。說發了牌。不能翻悔收進去的。自已趕緊的和下來是一副大牌。那種得意歡趹躍的神情。眞是要飛到天外去。這時一檯子四個人。含雲横豎没有什麽出進。輸了也是你左二少的。蕊雲的得意狂笑。眞好像戰勝了大將。詩晨是忘其所以。看着蕊雲的得意。使他只是出神。却把一個愚蠢的阿金。頻頻埋怨左詩晨。說二少。你不該打這一隻牌的。阿囡這副牌一色是明顯的了。詩晨便道。歸我一個人賠好嗎。這種打牌。只有人家孝順兒子陪老太太打牌。使他老人家歡心。到了後來民國時代。有一班軍閥家如張勳張作霖輩。他的下屬們。陪這班大軍閥打牌。也是如此。不想左詩晨陪蕊雲打牌。也曾用了這個法鬥。</p>

<p>▲後巿以漲度過速稍形回落</p>
<p>昨日粉巿、上午開盤後、各月份巿面、又呈激昂之狀態、其騰漲之程度、與前週之暴蕱、堪相彷彿因前日之洋麥報價、又回漲一元零、有此背影、已具勃發之機會更以標準開價、又生空前之新紀錄、以五百七十八兩之開價、匯率方面、當然又不可想象、因此人心大昻、本月份之初盤開價、即最高到二兩五錢六分二厘半、如以二月份之收盤言、彷彿差至四分半、即前月之三月份收價、亦無形高漲三分零、餘若四五月份亦各漲三分左右、迨至下午開盤、以暴漲太甚、本月份稍稍回落一分零、四五月份大致盤旋、六七月份因屬新粉、不過略見帶好、八月份係初次開拍、上落甚微、結果本月份較前月末收價、計又好一分七厘半、四月份好二分半、五月份好二分二厘半、六月份好七厘半、七月份好五厘、八月份較初價二厘半云、</p>

<p>Regarding Yan's actions, Li Shizeng, Zhang Ji, and Zhao Daiwen were appointed to investigate the truth.</p>

<p>▲Summary of the Chairman's Address: Since the Third National Congress held in May last year, more than half a year has passed. During this period, past work needs to be reviewed, and future work needs to be planned. Therefore, this Third Plenary Session is convened. The plans decided at the Third National Congress are completely based on the Premier's teachings, seeking the realization of the Three Principles of the People, which is the common aspiration of the entire nation and the goal to be achieved as soon as possible. According to the principle of governing the country by the Party, there is politics only after there is a Party. All military affairs should be subject to political control. This is the beginning of the period of political tutelage. Why are there still constant military conflicts, causing suffering to the people and hardship to the country? Most people do not understand the underlying reasons and inevitably harbor doubts. However, the plans decided at the two Disbandment Conferences convened last year aimed to eliminate general feudal thoughts and lead people onto the right path, making all troops an integral part of the Party and the country's army. This is the ultimate strategy for peaceful unification. However, warlords who harbor feudal ambitions have not grasped the true essence of the Party and national discipline. They are using the Party's banner to implement their destructive policies, believing that if disbandment succeeds, their feudal power will come to an end. Therefore, they are willing to become reactionaries, making a final struggle to betray the Party and the country. Therefore, the Central Government, in order to consolidate the foundation of the Party and the country, has no choice but to use force to restrain those reactionary elements who refuse to be led and deliberately engage in sabotage. Therefore, on the one hand, we are seeking the construction of political tutelage, and on the other hand, we are making military arrangements to promote the elimination of all reactionaries. Judging from the results of the military operations in the past few months and the direction of the hearts of the people across the country, it can be concluded that those who violate the Party's discipline and the people's psychology will be eliminated more quickly the more reactionary they are, no different from seeking their own doom. Using force within the country is originally unfortunate, but for the sake of safeguarding the Party and the country, it is a matter of practical necessity. Those who seek to fulfill their ambitions have ideas that are even more backward than the general public, and cannot be persuaded by legal principles, so we have to seek a final peace through force. During this meeting, all comrades should first examine ourselves to see how we have failed to invisibly eliminate the reactionaries, whether our methods are not good, or our guidance is not good, and what shortcomings there are in our work. We should check at any time, and strive for the soundness of the organization and the integrity of the methods in the future, so that all construction plans can be fully advanced without being hindered by any evil forces. We should pay attention to the expression of facts and not just to the propaganda of words. If there is both organization and method, then the reactionary forces can be resolved in the shortest possible time, without causing any impact on the Party and the country.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>◎ Gold Prices Soar Again</h3>
<p>The price of gold soared to 519.5 taels yesterday, closing at 517.9 taels, an unprecedented high. Some say that India's imposition of import duties on raw silver is one of the reasons for this surge. India levies import duties on raw silver while fully refunding the taxes on exported silver, indicating its eagerness to push its surplus silver abroad. If all silver-rich countries adopt this approach, the silver market will naturally become more crowded, inevitably leading to a day of uncontrollable crisis. Our country, at the end of the line, will suffer even more from its impact.</p>
<p>Fischer, a renowned economics professor at Yale University in the United States, recently expressed the view that the world's cash is gradually becoming insufficient to meet economic needs. If no measures are taken to implement international management of circulation and production methods, there will inevitably come a day within three years or slightly longer when there is insufficient turnover, commerce stagnates, prices collapse, and a global panic ensues. It can be seen that the world today is facing a situation where cash is becoming increasingly scarce while silver is becoming increasingly congested. With these two diametrically opposed situations, the fall of silver and the rise of gold are natural consequences. All countries will be affected commercially. Unless countries work together to seek a solution, there will be no escape from this giant tide that is rushing and sweeping away everything in its path.</p>
<p>Our country, which is most affected, urgently needs to seek remedial measures in practice. In particular, we must conduct thorough research from all aspects into methods that can be implemented, and not just pay lip service to promoting domestic goods, nor pin our hopes on vague and unknowable undertakings. To remedy the devaluation of silver, for example, some suggest that the Indian method of imposing import duties on raw silver could be implemented with modifications. However, others say that imposing silver taxes would also be detrimental to our country. This requires those who are well-versed in economic principles to study in detail before determining the standard for whether or not to implement it. To remedy the high price of gold, for example, there is also the issue of mining. Our country is not without minable gold mines. However, the reason why people do not blindly advocate it is because they lack confidence. This requires experts to thoroughly investigate the composition, plan the costs and methods, and only proceed when there is a firm grasp. All of these things cannot be achieved by empty words, nor can outsiders dare to speak rashly. Therefore, I deeply hope that our countrymen will truly think in terms of facts, and not just waste words without any results.</p>

<h3>Chiang Sends Telegram to the East</h3>
<p>Admonishing Shanxi Generals</p>
<p>Summoning the Spirit of Great Courage and Fearlessness</p>
<p>Suppressing Extraordinary Rebellion Before it Occurs</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang sent a telegram admonishing the generals of Shanxi. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>(Titles omitted) All of you, since Brother Baichuan joined the revolution in the 18th year of the Republic of China and completed the Northern Expedition, the importance and high regard that the Central Government has placed on Brother Baichuan is known to all our compatriots and comrades-in-arms throughout the army. However, Brother Baichuan suddenly advocated dissenting opinions, which shocked the world, and all were afraid that peaceful unification could not be maintained. The Central Government could not fathom Brother Baichuan's intentions and was absolutely unwilling to have peace easily destroyed, causing suffering to our compatriots, so it repeatedly issued admonitions, hoping that he would realize his errors. Today, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee also held fast to leniency, resolving to first investigate the truth, and the expectations have been benevolent and righteous. However, rumors are spreading on the streets, saying that all comrades also echoed Brother Baichuan, uttering absurdities that are absolutely unacceptable, and even saying that the troops under Brother Fu Yisheng have moved south from Cangzhou, the troops under Brother Feng Pengzhu have moved from Daokou, and the troops under Brother Zhang Mingfu have moved from Daming, all approaching western Shandong, while the troops under Brothers Sun Cuiyan, Yang Xiaou, and Yang Guangfu are concentrated on the Pinghan Railway, and the troops under Brothers Li Shumin, Wang Zhian, Li Yong, and Yan are concentrated on the Jinpu Railway, advancing southward step by step, not hesitating to provoke war and plunge the Party and the country into danger. I, Chiang, not only have the friendship of comrades-in-arms with all of you, but have also worked hard for the revolution together, risking our lives. I know that all of you will certainly not lightly abandon the history of the revolution, and sit idly by while Brother Baichuan is manipulated by all the reactionary forces, and all of you are regarded by the rebellious and traitorous elements as puppets of puppets. Only the distinction between right and wrong, obedience and disobedience, is extremely subtle. The spread of rumors requires early suppression. The current matter is that all of you are immersed in an adverse environment, and although your hearts are clear, your vision and hearing may not be your own. However, if viewed from the perspective of the overall revolutionary situation and the national interests, it is clearly the final struggle of the most adverse counter-revolutionary forces. Think about what our Party comrades have been fighting for, sacrificing themselves one after another, and who is the most unfavorable to the success of our Party's revolution? Since the Central Government put down the rebellion for a year, it has been gradually pacifying the situation. From now on, as long as we uphold the teachings of the late Premier and work hard to build political tutelage, how will the future of the national revolution develop? Now Brother Baichuan is suddenly making a sound of illness when he is not sick. It is really like the proverb says, "Ghosts are possessed, and the soul loses its master." What kind of people will these ghosts be in all the counter-revolutionary ranks? How will the people of the country judge these actions? In the past, Li Bai and other rebels, relying on their revolutionary merits, colluded with traitors within the Party to advocate the heresy of reorganization, and eventually they were completely abandoned by the country, and their defeat was imminent. Now, Brother Baichuan's actions, as evidenced by what I have heard here, are to replace the blue sky and white sun flag with the five-color flag, and to use the general resolution as a way to resolve Party affairs. Tracing the source and digging out the root, how is it any different from the remnants of the warlords in Dalian and Qingdao? I, Chiang, privately believe that today is actually the most obvious decisive battle between revolution and counter-revolution, and Brother Baichuan has been taken advantage of by the demons. If he does not realize his errors, he will have no escape when he is judged for his crimes for thousands of years. I, Chiang, can only lament. All of you have either followed the Premier and made alliances for many years, or have repeatedly led troops and participated in battles, and have glorious names in the history of the revolution. At this time of crisis and shock, can you not remember the sacrifices of the revolutionary comrades-in-arms and the revolutionary people in the past, and endure the revolutionary foundations that have just been laid being destroyed by the enemy? Can you not cherish your merits and fame and be willing to be in the same ranks as the most unbearable counter-revolutionary forces? I hope that you will recognize right and wrong, uphold justice, and earnestly persuade Brother Baichuan to extricate himself as soon as possible, so that both public and private interests can be preserved, which is what the Party and the country rely on. Otherwise, how can the Jing and Wei rivers flow together, and the purple and vermilion colors will be robbed? I also hope that you will summon the spirit of great courage and fearlessness, and suppress the extraordinary rebellion before it occurs. The stakes of obedience and disobedience, benefit and detriment, are not shallow. I dare to express my sincerity and offer my loyal advice, and look forward to a clear reply to dispel the doubts of the masses. Chiang Kai-shek, East Seal. (Special dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<h3>Han Shiyou Calls for Peace</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Han Fuju and Shi Yousan sent a joint telegram on the 27th calling for peace, saying that recently the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief have been consulting on national affairs, and the heads of the various departments have also been discussing with each other, all with peaceful unification as their goal. Fu Ju and others maintain peace and support unification, and this will not change. When foreign troubles are rampant and internal worries are incessant, if we engage in fratricidal strife and promote peace through armed force, regardless of whether we achieve our goal, in this era of the strong preying on the weak, the country will also perish together. If there is another way to achieve peace under military force, even if we sacrifice our lives, we will follow it. (Special dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<h3>Zhu and He Exhort Han and Shi</h3>
<p>If Necessary, Please Organize a Retreat</p>
<p>Su, Anhui, Hubei, and Shandong are All Available for Stationing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Peide and He Yingqin sent the following telegram to Han and Shi on the 1st:</p>
<p>Chairman Han Xiangfang of Kaifeng, Commander Shi Hanzhang of Guide, Greetings. Having read your telegram, detailing your painstaking efforts to maintain peace and support unification, and lamenting the scourge of war, advocating that national affairs be resolved by the Party headquarters, after reading it, I am filled with admiration. Since the Northern Expedition was completed, the Central Government has always regarded peaceful unification as its mission. Unfortunately, accidents have occurred repeatedly, causing great suffering to our people. But those who use the country's military force to seize personal power will not avoid destroying themselves. The distinction between right and wrong, obedience and disobedience, is the judgment of victory or defeat, survival or death. Even if a person has no national ideology or national consciousness, how can they have no distinction for their own interests, and willingly embark on the path of suicide? Fang believes that from now on, no one will dare to destroy peaceful unification and rekindle the flames of war. Unexpectedly, those who had personally participated in suppressing the rebellion are now taking the same action, and the strange theories that emerged shocked the country. Recently, more ominous movements have been heard in the Tianjin area, and there is a great tendency for war to break out at any moment. Peide and others were deeply worried when we suddenly saw your great theories, as if we had heard the gospel. I deeply hope to inspire peace and harmony, clear away the clouds and fog, and that those who first uttered the dissenting opinions will also repent and learn, and rein in their horses on the cliff. Maintaining peace is a great fortune for the country and the people. If they are stubborn and still want to use military force to carry out their oppression, Henan will be the first to bear the brunt. You can first organize a retreat to avoid their edge. The territory of the provinces of Su, Anhui, Hubei, and Shandong can all be used as temporary places for you to garrison, so that those who willingly destroy peaceful unification can be subject to the proper judgment of the Party and the country. The Central Government and the compatriots of the whole country are your backing, and the goal of maintaining peace and supporting unification will eventually be achieved. Moreover, in this era of governing the country, important national affairs should be decided by the Party, and the Party's system and discipline cannot be disrupted. Everything should be based on the general charter. When the National Congress is adjourned, the Central Executive Committee should be the highest authority. Our comrades are all able to abide by the resolutions of the Central Party Headquarters, so what disputes cannot be resolved? Your proposals are just and fair, and Peide and others deeply admire them, and are willing to encourage all comrades to work together. I respectfully send this telegram, hoping for your discernment. Zhu Peide, He Yingqin, sincerely kowtow. (Special dispatch on the 1st)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Beiping Telegram on the 1st: 1. Yan's betrayal of the Central Government has been clearly indicated. After the telegram was issued, there was little response. He Rugen, Liu Zhennian, Yang Hucheng, and the generals in central Henan are now sending telegrams to Yan to question him, because Yan falsely listed their names. 2. Lu Zhonglin strongly advocates calm in the current situation, and most of the generals of the Northwest Army do not advocate helping Yan, saying that Yan and the Anfu clique are secretly planning to organize a government in Beiping, which violates public opinion and is contrary to the purpose of the army. Therefore, they are very indifferent to Yan. 3. Yan has recently become quite suspicious of the Northwest Army and has not provided sufficient assistance. Therefore, there is no news of the Northwest Army leaving the pass. 4. The scenes in Beiping and other places have changed greatly in recent days. The Anfu, Research, Political Studies, Xishan, and Reorganization factions are carrying out activities on a large scale. Yan has set up reception centers in Bing, taking in members of various factions. Even the Communist Party and Soviet Russian representatives are joining hands with them.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications, considering that the unequal water conservancy contract in the Great Northeast would expire at the end of the 18th year of the Republic, formally notified the company that it would be terminated from the 19th year of the Republic.

<h3>Tense Situation in Spain</h3>
<p>The King's Position Appears Dim</p>
<p>The Army and Church Can Still Be Relied Upon</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Madrid, 1st. Can the king remain in his position for long? This is what Spaniards are asking each other this morning. Since the failure of the Czech system and the speech by Dr. Gurla criticizing it, the situation has been tense, and the king's personal position is in a dim light. However, it is not actually very weak, because a large part of the army and the church, which has great influence in Spain, can be relied upon by the king, and the domestic conservatives and ordinary women can also be the king's support. The current Prime Minister General Berenguer said that Dr. Gurla's remarks on Thursday were only the opinions of politicians in the opposition who have not heard of actual politics and are not important. It is reported that disturbances have occurred in several places in Spain, and many students have been arrested in Barcelona.</p>
<h3>Naval Conference Still Has No Progress</h3>
<p>Japanese and American Representatives Meet Three Times</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Goes to Villa for Vacation</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 28th. This morning, the representatives of the Naval Conference met once, but there was no important development. The British Prime Minister went to his villa this evening for vacation.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, London, 28th. At 11:30 this morning, Matsudaira and Lee, both plenipotentiaries, held their third meeting at the Leser Hotel, which lasted ten minutes. The content of the meeting was kept strictly secret by both parties and cannot be known. However, it is reported that both Japan and the United States are painstakingly trying to find a point of agreement using various figures within the scope permitted by the instructions. It is also reported that the attitude of the United States is to wait for a proposal from Japan. Regarding this matter, the plenipotentiary said to reporters that the reason why today's meeting only lasted ten minutes was because Lee, the plenipotentiary, will go to the countryside for vacation at the end of the week, and there is no intention to continue until next week. However, if necessary, it is also planned to meet during the holiday. The content involves all general issues and has discussed direct interests, and each and every one has been subjected to review of numbers. Now that both parties have begun real contact, it will not be possible to complete it rapidly, and the scope of negotiation is gradually expanding. Not only does it still require several days of consultation with the United States, but also with the United Kingdom, there will be several meetings. Also, because the problem is important, it is currently necessary to contact the home country.</p>
<h3>India's New Budget</h3>
<p>Increased Import Tax on Cotton Goods</p>
<p>Causes Japanese Displeasure</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New Delhi, 28th. When Sir George Schuster, the finance member of the Indian Executive Council, presented the budget proposal to increase the cotton goods tax in the Legislative Council, he made a speech that clearly implied that economic autonomy is part of the Indian constitution. Although the change in Indian tax rates hinders the interests of the British, the British government can only negotiate and request. The gentleman said that the British government had telegraphed</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>to the Indian government, considering the serious impact on Britain caused by the increase in tariffs by India, and declared that the British government was aware of this impact and that the Indian government did not intend to cause it by enacting laws. The Indian government then replied, expressing deep sympathy, but declared that the most important thing is the interests of India. At the same time, India is politically aware of the importance of taking into account British public opinion, so the Indian government proposes that a protection tax of 5% be added to imported cotton goods not manufactured in the United Kingdom. This is the suggestion of the Indian government. As for the final decision, the Legislative Council exercises its power. This proposal may arouse much criticism, but the Indian government</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Osaka, 1st. Here, the news of India's proposed increase in cotton goods tax in the budget is highly valued, because the proposed tax rate is higher than expected by most people. It is regarded as a very heavy blow to Japanese trade, and the imposition of an ad valorem tax of at least three and a half annas (Indian currency name) per pound of hand-woven raw cloth is especially unsatisfactory to the Japanese.</p>
<p>This is aimed at Japanese goods. Cotton cloth manufacturers here believe that this proposal by the Indian government is completely contrary to the spirit of the recent suggestion by the British consul in Osaka that the United Kingdom and Japan have a good understanding in the cloth market. The deputy general manager of Toyo Cotton Spinning Company stated this morning that India will increase the import tax on cotton goods from 11% to 15% for the purpose of increasing income. He did not conveniently criticize it. However, raw hand-woven cloth is the main Japanese goods imported into India. Now, if an ad valorem tax is to be levied, it is tantamount to prohibiting its import. This kind of proposal can be said to be tyrannical.</p>
<p>welcomes extremely detailed criticisms. The Indian government hopes that the Legislative Council will make a decision with calm and fair spirit. According to the above budget proposal, it is proposed to increase the import tax on cotton cloth from 11% to 15%, and for non-British goods, another protection tax of 5% will be levied for a period of three years. A tax of four annas (Indian currency name) per ounce is levied on the import of silver.</p>
<h3>Domingan Civil War Ceasefire Agreement Reached</h3>

<p>▲Reuters, New York, 28th. The US Ambassador to Domingo, Curtis, telegraphed to the State Department that the revolutionary army leader has reached a ceasefire agreement with the Farkez government.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 28th. According to news from the capital of Domingo, the revolutionary army leader Urilla has been elected as the provisional president.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of Japanese Elections</h3>
<p>Mass Party Argues General Election Invalid</p>
<p>Muto Sanji Accused</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 1st. The Japanese Leizhong Party argues that the general election on February 20 was invalid. The reason is that the general election day should be counted from the date of dissolution and a day should be selected within 30 days. If this general election is counted from the date of dissolution, that is, February 20, it happens to be the 31st day and should be invalid. However, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Interior both believe that February 20 is based on legal interpretation and is counted from the next day, so it is not a problem. However, the National Farmers' Union argues that the interpretation of the Civil Code is different from the Common Election Law. In short, this matter will not become a problem, but it is an interesting interpretation.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 1st. Today, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun commented on the failure of the Seiyukai in this general election, saying that because of the election failure, the Seiyukai is likely to have internal strife. Will the Seiyukai be reborn or reverse to full power? President Inukai proposed his old body, traveling south and north, never having time to warm his seat. The sincerity is commendable, but relying solely on speeches cannot obtain the number. The current Seiyukai really has a sense of indefinite control. President Inukai, although courageous, lacks control and will never be able to win. The announcement of the election committee and the publicly recognized candidates was not agile. In various places, there were candidates holding name cards of the Inukai faction, Tokonami faction, and Suzuki faction. In Miyazaki Prefecture, due to the opposition between the Tokonami faction and the Suzuki faction, the publicly recognized candidates were delayed in making a decision, so the advantage of this base, which has a quota of five, was actually taken away by the Minseito, which won four seats. In the future, it is necessary to establish a new policy with a new cadre organization to seek restoration. Zhonglao and others in Okaazaki should also be patient and self-respecting, and elect a suitable person to be the president.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Osaka, 1st. Yesterday, someone at the Osaka District Public Prosecutor's Office accused Muto Sanji of having a feast before the election, and the authorities immediately started an investigation. The nominee is a certain police chief, but it is a pseudonym. The Osaka Police Chief firmly believes that Muto has not violated the election, but because of the time, it has aroused public attention.</p>
<h3>London Market Silver Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 1st. Yesterday, the price of silver fell sharply. The spot price of silver bars fell from 19 pence and 11/10 of a penny per ounce to 19 pence and 1/8 of a penny. The futures fell from 19 pence and 9/16 of a penny to 19 pence and 1/16 of a penny. The reason for this price and the latest low record is due to the lack of demand in India and China, and the news that India is considering levying import silver tax.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 28th. Today, the price of tin in the London market fell sharply, with each ton selling for 168 pounds, 1 shilling, and 3 pence, which is the lowest price since 1922. The lowest tin price in 1922 was 139 pounds.</p>
<h3>International Conference to Be Held in The Hague</h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Geneva, 28th. Today, the secretariat of the International League announced that the work in March will be the most important step in maintaining world peace since the establishment of the National League, because the first international conference to negotiate international public law will be held on the 13th at the Carnegie Peace Palace in The Hague. At that time, it is hoped that major issues such as nationality, territorial waters, and the responsibility of countries for external injuries to the lives and property of foreigners will be codified first. The remaining issues will be discussed later. However, because this meeting is extremely important and the London Naval Conference has not yet been completed, the member states have limited energy, so other work of the National League will not be as much as usual. In addition to the committee for amending the League's constitution continuing to meet, there will only be the meeting of the Transportation Advisory Committee convened on March 10 and the special meeting of the Trusteeship Committee at the end of the month. The Trusteeship Committee will thoroughly investigate the conflict between the Palestinian Arabs and Jews last year.</p>
<h3>Taidio Does Not Give Up Forming a Cabinet</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu, Paris, 28th. Taidio, who is working hard to unite the various factions to form a new cabinet, will meet with President Dume this afternoon to report that the preparation for forming a cabinet has been completed.</p>
<h3>Taft's Condition Unchanged</h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Washington, 28th. Former Chief Justice Taft's condition this morning has not changed much. The doctor said that Taft slept very well last night.</p>
<h3>Chicago Searches Communist Organs</h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Chicago, 28th. The police authorities here dispatched Yan Suo to various communist organs, and as a result, found many certificates, hoping to gather various radical parties on March 6 to launch an event in Europe, America, and other places. This move was mostly dominated by the Moscow Third International. A few days ago, communist parties simultaneously paraded in Chicago, Los Angeles, and other cities and towns in the United States, probably the prelude to a major event. According to the staff of the Law Department in Washington, the department has long been aware of the activities of these people, but it is sure that they can be successful.</p>
<p>Public Telegrams</p>
<p>◎To All Newspaper Offices in Hankou,</p>
<p>I recently received a circular telegram from Vice Commander Yan, listing the name of Jin Yu. Jin Yu was not involved in the matter beforehand.

In addition to presenting a request to Minister Yang to investigate and publishing a telegram to the Ministry, we must also publish a statement in the newspaper. Lin Zhong, Lin Shougou Dong, Brigade Commander of the 12th Independent Brigade of the Marine Corps.</p>

<h3>◎Central Standing Committee Reports Work</h3>
<p>▲To Be Submitted to the Third Plenary Session</p>
<p>The Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang today reported on its work to the Third Plenary Session. The original text is as follows: In June last year, the Central Executive Committee of this session held its Second Plenary Meeting. There were detailed discussions and concrete plans for the progress of party affairs and the revitalization of politics, and the declaration clearly indicated the main tasks to be carried out in the future. Since the closing of the Second Plenary Meeting until now, it has been eight months. During this period, the Standing Committee has been adhering to the principles shown by the Plenary Meeting to strive for the promotion of party affairs and politics, and has paid special attention to the implementation of the resolutions of the Plenary Meeting. Now, the progress of the work in these eight months is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Implementation of the Resolutions of the Second Plenary Meeting. The resolutions of the Second Plenary Meeting are mostly active and concrete principles, so most of them have limited periods, and it is hoped that they will be implemented. The important ones, in terms of party affairs, include the Plan for the Progress of Party Affairs during the Period of Political Tutelage and the Organizational Program of People's Organizations. In terms of politics, there are the Regulations for the Period of Political Tutelage, the Completion of Local Autonomy, the Regulations for the Exercise of Governance, the Jurisdiction of Administrative Matters, the Completion of the Five Yuan Organizations and the Revitalization of Politics, such as diplomacy, military affairs, transportation, education, internal affairs, agriculture, mining, commerce, economic construction, river management, bandit suppression, etc., as well as the strict enforcement of opium prohibition and the revitalization of Mongolia and Tibet. After the closing of the Plenary Meeting, the Standing Committee urged all parties to engage in the implementation of the resolutions. Those in charge of party affairs were entrusted to the Central Departments, Offices, and Committees to plan and implement them separately, and instructed party headquarters at all levels to strictly abide by them. Those in charge of political affairs were separately handed over to the Political Conference and the National Government and its subordinate agencies to be responsible for handling them, and their progress was supervised at any time. For the work originally scheduled to be completed within a time limit, efforts were made to ensure that it would be completed as scheduled. Later, because some of the work that had reached the deadline was still not completed within the time limit, it was decided at the 38th Standing Committee meeting on September 26 of last year to supervise and urge them separately, and it was decided at the 64th Standing Committee meeting on January 13 of this year to unify the completion within two months. Now, the work specified in each case can be gradually carried out according to the schedule, except for those that are indeed hindered by facts or whose implementation methods still need precise planning. All conditions of progress are detailed in another table and will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>(2) Reform and Enrichment of the Internal Organization of the Association. The Plan for the Progress of Party Affairs passed by the Second Plenary Meeting decided on two items regarding the internal organization of the Central Party Headquarters: (1) All matters concerning the organization, guidance, and training of mass organizations shall be handled by the Training Department. The Organization Department need not set up a separate Mass Organization Section to unify power and avoid the disadvantages of divergent and repetitive work. (2) Each agency that has been decided to be established by the Central Government, such as the Laws and Regulations Compilation and Review Committee, the Mass Training Design Committee, and the Central Library, should immediately designate a commissioner to be responsible for preparing for its establishment and actively working. Regarding the first item, in accordance with the original plan, the Mass Organization Section of the Organization Department was abolished, and all powers were merged into the Training Department. Later, because the mass training work was heavy, the competent authority had to be appropriately expanded, and it was passed at the 26th Standing Committee meeting on July 22 of last year to establish a Mass Training Office under the Training Department to take charge of all mass training matters. Regarding the second item, active preparations have also been made. Some have been formally established and started working, and some are still under preparation. Here is a brief list: (1) The Laws and Regulations Compilation and Review Committee decided on the selection of full-time committee members and committee members at the 19th Standing Committee meeting on June 27 of last year in accordance with the provisions of the organizational regulations, and was organized and established immediately and started working in July. (2) The Fuxu Committee was originally decided to be established in the second session, but it was delayed. It was discussed at the 8th Standing Committee meeting on May 6 of last year and decided to hand it over to the Secretariat for drafting. At the 22nd Standing Committee meeting on July 8, the Secretariat submitted a draft of the organizational regulations, which was approved and passed. Five committee members were elected and established at the 23rd Standing Committee meeting on the 11th of the same month. (3) The Party History and Historical Materials Compilation Committee originally had the regulations of the Party History Compilation Committee in the organization system of the Central Executive Committee passed by the first Plenary Meeting of this session. At the 60th Standing Committee meeting on December 26 of last year, the Secretariat submitted its opinions for discussion. At the 62nd Standing Committee meeting on January 6 of this year, it was decided to change the name to the Party History and Historical Materials Compilation Committee, and elected eleven committee members. The organizational outline was passed at the 73rd Standing Committee meeting on February 13. All preparations are being made and it will be established in the near future. (4) The Central Library was originally organized by members sent by various departments to form a preparatory committee. At the 28th Standing Committee meeting on August 1 of last year, the organizational regulations of the preparatory committee were passed. The construction of the library building is about to be completed, and the date of establishment should not be far away. In addition, in response to the actual needs, two more committees were added, one is the Central Examination Committee for Party Doctrine Teachers, and the other is the Central Management Committee for Sending Students to Study Abroad. As for the internal organization of the original Central Departments, Offices, and Committees, there have also been slight reforms, such as the changes in the name system of the sections and shares of the Secretariat, the expansion of the Mass Training Section of the Training Department into the Mass Training Office, the Boy Scout Headquarters directly under the Central Government, and the establishment of the Boy Scout Training Section under the Training Department. The Central Overseas Compatriots Reception Office is managed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee. Furthermore, regarding the Central Political Conference, there is also something worth mentioning. According to the regulations of the Political Conference, there were original provisions for grouping. At the 30th Standing Committee meeting on August 15 of last year, it was decided to revise the number of committee members in the grouping to three to seven people, and the grouping was implemented immediately. At the 45th Standing Committee meeting on October 31, three measures for enriching the content of each group of the Political Conference were passed: (1) Enriching the Secretariat of the Political Conference, adding a number of counselors to work in groups, and employing professional talents; (2) The central administrative departments must first go through the review of each group of the Political Conference regarding policy plans and important events; (3) The existing committee members of each group shall be increased or adjusted by the Political Conference to enrich them. Later, according to a letter from the Political Conference requesting that the counselor be renamed Special Secretary, the 58th Standing Committee meeting decided to amend the regulations of the Political Conference accordingly.</p>
<p>(3) Reorganization and Guidance of Party Headquarters in Various Places. Since the Second Plenary Meeting until now, the reorganization of party headquarters in various places, except for those that have been formally established with sound organizations and those whose reorganizers have achieved good results and have not changed much, can be briefly summarized as follows: (A) Formally Established Party Headquarters: (1) Those that have been reorganized or prepared and have independently elected executive and supervisory committee members and have been approved by the Central Committee for record, include the Jinpu Railway Special Party Headquarters and the Central Political School District Party Headquarters domestically, and the Nanyang Dutch General Branch, the Australian General Branch, the Korean Branch, the Burmese General Branch, the Indian General Branch, the London Branch, the Peruvian Lima Branch, the Mexican General Branch, the Haiphong Branch, the Madagascar Branch, the Honolulu General Branch, the South African General Branch, the Liverpool Branch, the Annam General Branch, the American General Branch, the Philippine General Branch, and the Hanoi Directly Subordinate Branch overseas. (2) Those that have been reorganized and have elected candidates for executive and supervisory committee members in accordance with the number of executive and supervisory committee members and the election law stipulated by the Central Committee, including the Jiangxi Provincial Party Headquarters (executive committee members and alternate executive committee members), the Shanxi Provincial Party Headquarters (supervisory committee members and alternate supervisory committee members), and the Anhui Provincial Party Headquarters (supervisory committee members). (3) For party headquarters that have been established, if the term of office of the executive and supervisory committee members has expired, and the re-election has been approved, and the number of members and the election law of the next session have been stipulated, there are the Nanjing Special Municipal Party Headquarters and the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters. (B) Reorganization of Originally Established Party Headquarters: (1) The executive committee members of the Tianjin Special Municipal and Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters had no leadership, and were all dismissed and reorganized. (2) The Guangxi Provincial Executive Committee had virtually stopped operating after the rebellion of Executive Committee Member Huang Shaoxiong and others. Subordinate party headquarters of the Jiangsu Provincial Executive Committee had incidents of reaction from time to time, and some of the executive committee members were important reactionary elements. The Supervisory Committee failed to perform its duties. They were successively dissolved and reorganized. (C) Reorganization of Guidance Committees, Preparatory Committees, and Special Commissioners in Party Headquarters Under Reorganization: (1) Guidance Committees: All guidance committee members of the Henan, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Suiyuan, Guizhou, and Inner Mongolia Party Headquarters were successively recalled and replaced. In addition, the Shaanxi Provincial Guidance Committee Member was dismissed and investigated for absurd remarks and betrayal of the Central Committee. The Guidance Committee Member of the French General Branch was dismissed and investigated for sending letters and telegrams without authorization and slandering the Central Committee. They were replaced and it was announced that the representative meeting convened without authorization and the elected executive and supervisory committee members were all invalid. (2) Preparatory Committees: The preparatory committee members of the Pinghan Zhenlu Special Party Headquarters were recalled and replaced. (3) Special Commissioners: The special commissioners in Harbin and Chahar were all recalled and replaced (to be continued).</p>
<h3>◎Mr. Ruan Zhaochang's Talk</h3>
<p>The Resolution Process of Gao Guizi's Troops</p>
<p>▲Gao Guizi's Troops at Linyi Have Collapsed and Retreating Towards Yishui and Rizhao</p>
<p>▲The Jin Army from Caozhou Briefly Entered Shandong Province and Then Withdrew</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Ruan Zhaochang, Commander of the 55th Division, returned to Jinan from Lincheng on the evening of the 25th, bringing with him over a hundred captured soldiers from Gao Guizi's troops. At 2:00 PM on the 26th, a reporter visited Mr. Ruan at the General Headquarters and inquired about the resolution process of Gao Guizi's troops and the military situation in southern Shandong. Mr. Ruan made the following remarks:</p>
<p>"The resolution of the 19th Division of Gao Guizi's troops this time was carried out under the order of the Central Government. Because Gao Guizi had acts of resistance against the Central Government, we had no choice but to take decisive military action. The purpose of resolving Gao's troops was merely to reorganize them. Therefore, the predetermined plan was to surround Gao's troops and then use peaceful means to persuade the soldiers to obey the order to surrender their weapons and await reorganization. Starting from the 18th, the Central Army</p>
<p>was responsible for resolving Gao's troops in Linyi, the 55th Division was responsible for resolving Gao's troops in Yixian and Zaozhuang, and the 46th Division, Fan Xiji's troops, the Xi Han and Dong Chen Zhongfu brigades were responsible for resolving Gao's troops in Anqiu and Zhucheng. Gao Guizi himself went to Zaozhuang once on the 19th, but returned to Linyi on the same day. At dawn on the 20th, the Central Army and the Shandong Army surrounded Gao's troops in Linyi, Yixian, Zaozhuang, Anqiu, and Zhucheng. Gao's troops stationed in Yixian and Zaozhuang, although claiming to be a brigade, were actually only a regiment, with two battalions stationed in Zaozhuang and one battalion stationed in Yixian. The 55th Division's Yue Shengxuan brigade surrounded Gao's troops in Zaozhuang at 6:00 AM on the 20th. Unexpectedly, before the order to surrender weapons and reorganize could be issued, Gao's troops opened fire, killing a company commander of the Yue brigade. The two sides then engaged in fierce fighting. By 12:00 PM, Gao's troops were gradually unable to withstand the attack and fled in disorder. Many were killed by the Yue brigade, and only two or three hundred escaped. The Yue brigade also suffered 48 soldiers killed and 42 wounded. As for Gao's troops in Yixian, they also opened fire with the Yue brigade at 5:00 AM on the 20th. It was not until 11:00 AM on the morning of the 21st that Gao's troops obeyed the order and surrendered all their weapons. They were then taken to Yanzhou by Zhaochang and incorporated into various units. Gao's troops in the Anqiu area were also surrounded by the Xi Han and Dong brigades on the morning of the 20th. Gao's troops did not resist and retreated southward. The Ding brigade seized over a hundred rifles. As for Gao's troops in Zhucheng and Linyi, they were also surrounded by the 46th Division's Chen Zhongfu brigade and the Central Army at the same time. Because the city walls in both places were very strong, they have not been resolved yet. In the battle of Zhucheng, a battalion commander of the Chen brigade was killed in action. When Zhaochang came north from Lincheng yesterday, he heard that Gao's troops in Linyi had retreated towards Yishui and Rizhao, and the Central Army was pursuing them. Southern Shandong is now extremely peaceful. The Shandong Army of the Jinpu Railway is stationed to Lincheng, connecting the defense lines, and there will be no accidents. As for western Shandong, Zhaochang sent people to inspect. The 42nd Division of the Jin Army, Feng Pengzhu's troops, only had a platoon each in Heze and Dingtao, which were of a preliminary nature. The main force has not arrived and has now completely withdrawn. It is said that Yan Xishan sent a telegram to the Shandong Provincial Government, stating that Commander Feng's southward movement was to suppress bandits in Daming and not to spy on Shandong, and asked not to be misunderstood. There have been no recent troop movements in the Shandong Army. Xu Huating has opened to Jining and has already arrived. The 164th Brigade, Li Songshan's troops, is still stationed in Jinan, and the 165th Brigade, Zhang Bin's troops, is still stationed in Tai'an. However, when Zhang's troops were resolving Gao Guizi, a regiment was transferred to Yanzhou. Zhaochang came to Jinan to report to Chief Commander Chen the resolution of the Yizao Gao troops, and is scheduled to return south tomorrow (the 27th)." (The 26th)</p>

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, they rested, and then Zhang Xueliang hosted a banquet at the Border Defense Headquarters. After the meal, the meeting continued from 7:00 PM until 11:00 PM. It is reported that they advocated supporting the central government's peaceful unification in their views on the current situation, and protecting the territory and ensuring the safety of the people in their views on local affairs.

<h3>◎Investigation of Losses in Russian Cases in Jilin Province</h3>
<p>▲Total Claims Exceed 17 Million Yuan</p>
<p>▲Military Losses Not Included</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: The Jilin Russian Cases Loss Investigation Committee was established in September last year. It separately prepared various loss investigation forms, attached with investigation instructions and investigation outlines, and ordered the counties along the border to conduct thorough investigations and report according to the format. The military losses were handled by the Border Defense Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office in Jilin as a special case. Later, due to the obstructed roads and inconvenient transportation in the counties along the border, it was feared that the investigation reports would not be detailed enough. The committee then submitted a request to the provincial government to appoint Kong Xianxi, Xu Jingming, and Wang Junting as special investigators, who went to the border areas to conduct thorough investigations. This work has now been completed. The committee also received a telegram from the Northeast Political Affairs Committee a few days ago, ordering the entire investigation case to be sent by a deadline. After receiving the telegram, the committee compiled a summary table based on the investigation figures of various members, sorted by category. The total loss amounted to more than 17,100,490 yuan in silver dollars. The committee has prepared a document to submit to the provincial government for forwarding to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, so that it can be presented during the Sino-Russian conference to demand compensation. The military losses are currently being actively investigated. (February 23rd)</p>
<h3>◎The Tragic Situation of Deaths in the Shaanxi Famine</h3>
<p>▲Starving Corpses Everywhere, Eaten by Others</p>
<p>▲Everything Has Been Eaten, Even Sparrows and Mice Have Disappeared</p>
<p>Ping Correspondence: According to a special investigator from the Shaanxi Famine Relief Association in Ping, who came from Shaanxi, the recent disaster situation in the province is extremely tragic. It is said that "In the cities of Shaanxi Province, groups of starving people are begging for food everywhere, supporting the old and carrying the young. When they see food, they snatch it at will. Therefore, it is not uncommon for small vendors to be robbed. In front of the Relief Association, crowds of disaster victims gather every day, crying for help, their voices piercing the sky. In the counties, every family closes its doors during the day. Even if close friends knock on the door, they must carefully listen and identify the sound for a long time before daring to open the door. A pound of steamed buns costs 18,000 copper coins, with six buns per pound, which are very rough and black. A liter of bran costs one silver dollar, and a dou of mi gu (a type of grain) costs more than four silver dollars. A bag of white flour costs more than fourteen or fifteen silver dollars. Young women solicit people on the street, seeking only a full meal. You can get a woman without spending a penny. The scene on the streets is bleak, with a gloomy atmosphere, no less than the gates of hell. In the villages and towns, nine out of ten houses are uninhabited. Starving corpses are everywhere, cut up and eaten by others, the flesh and blood blurred, unbearable to look at. Not only have cattle, mules, dogs, chickens, and cats been eaten completely, but even sparrows and mice have disappeared. They even dig up graves and corpses, cut them up and burn them for food. The tragic situation is beyond description. Houses, fields, and belongings, even if you want to exchange them for silver to relieve hunger, no one will care. At present, there are more than three feet of snow accumulated along the road in Guanzhong (central Shaanxi), and it is bitterly cold. The general disaster victims have no clothes or food, and those who freeze and starve to death number no less than five or six hundred per county per day on average. At present, the counties are preparing for spring relief, but they have no food or funds, so what can they do? The only thing to do is to report the situation truthfully and ask the association to find ways to provide a large amount of food and funds for emergency relief. The disaster in Shaanxi is so severe that it is hoped that all the great philanthropists at home and abroad will work together to rescue and save the catastrophe. Do not have a view of the Hu Yue (distant states) regarding wealth and poverty. The people of Shaanxi are fortunate."</p>
<h3>◎Wu Xingya's Remarks After Arriving in Hankou</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Wu Xingya, member of the Hubei Provincial Government and Director of the Civil Affairs Department, arrived in Hankou from Nanjing on the Anfeng military plane at 3:00 PM on the 27th. After landing, he went directly to the headquarters to meet Acting Director He Chengjun and reported on the instructions requested in Nanjing regarding the pacification of Hubei Province and the direction of governance. He then went to the provincial government's office in Hankou and met with the committee members Huang Maogu, Zhang Guanshi, Fang Dazhi, Xiong Bingkun, Xie Lu, and Peng Jieshi to discuss the future direction of governance and pacification plan. On March 3rd, he took the oath of office. A reporter recently interviewed Mr. Wu at his private residence and obtained his remarks, which stated: "This time, I have been ordered to preside over civil affairs, and I know that my talent and ability are limited and cannot help the difficulties of the times. However, out of respect and love for my hometown, I cannot refuse. In the future, I will follow the party's political program, start anew with the people, first clarify official governance, then complete the county organization, and promote local autonomy. Other matters, such as promoting industry, banning opium, promoting cooperative undertakings, and developing the rural economy, although not entirely within the scope of civil affairs, are all closely related to civil affairs. I will work with the directors of the Huang and Zhang departments to strive to achieve them. As for the rampant bandits and communists in Hubei Province, the immediate plan is to strictly implement rural cleansing and implement the baojia (household registration) system to make it impossible for criminals to hide and for the good people to live in peace. In the long run, we must still implement moral education so that everyone will not want to do wrong." (February 27th)</p>
<h3>◎Recent Bandit News from Xuzhou</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: There have been frequent bandit alerts in places such as Shaolouwei and Daxujia in eastern Xuzhou. Government troops have been dispatched to suppress them separately. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>▲Shaolouwei is located sixty li east of Xubu City and is a wealthy place in the old Danji market. At dawn on the 25th, it was suddenly attacked by bandits led by Cao Wenxing, Zhu Conglun, and others, numbering three to four hundred. They looted extensively and kidnapped more than thirty men and women as hostages. The public security team stationed at Xiaotashan heard the news and blocked them from afar, while also reporting to the city. The Tongshan County Office, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched the public security team to suppress them and reported to Liu Zhi, requesting him to send troops to jointly suppress them. Liu ordered a company of infantry and a company of near-attack artillery to depart on the 26th to jointly suppress them. Today (the 27th), it was reported that after looting Shaolouwei, the bandits fled northeast towards Banqiao. A division of troops and the public security team are searching for them. The Shaolouwei, which was attacked, has also been properly dealt with by the district.</p>
<p>▲Daxujia is a station on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. Recently, a large group of bandits, resembling defeated soldiers, who had fled from the south, have been causing trouble in the area west of Daxujia. The troops stationed on the Grand Canal heard the news and ambushed them on the east side. Unexpectedly, the bandits damaged a section of the railway track on the morning of the 26th. Commander-in-Chief Liu, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched a team to suppress them. The railway track was repaired by the railway bureau on the morning of the 27th. The bandits have fled towards eastern Shandong. (February 27th)</p>
<h3>◎Hangzhou Quick News</h3>
<p>▲The Hangzhou City held a large-scale tree planting movement on the 12th of this month. The location was at Leifeng Pagoda (i.e., South Ping Mountain in West Lake). The Department of Construction has set up an office to prepare for it and is actively carrying it out. Yesterday, a letter was sent to various hospitals to send health teams to the venue to provide services on that day.</p>
<p>▲Recently, there have been frequent conflicts between the military police in the new market. Yesterday (the 28th) afternoon, a soldier from the security team and a police officer had a dispute over a trivial matter, resulting in a major martial arts drama. Today, all the police officers in the second district of the area are not working and are waiting for a resolution. At 4:00 PM, Wang Zuyao, Wang Xirong, Jin Runquan, Zhu Mou first and Mi Tingfang, members of the standing committee of the Hangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, invited Director Dong of the Security Department, Regiment Commander Lai, Director Zhao of the Water Police, Director Li of the Public Security Bureau, and more than twenty other people to the meeting to discuss the joint military and police measures, and at the same time persuaded the police in the area to serve as usual.</p>
<p>▲Qian, the director of the Liangzhe Salt Affairs Inspection Office, is very diligent in rectifying salt affairs, so tax revenue has gradually increased. Now that it is the season for vegetable sales and production, which will inevitably be more prosperous, it is specifically scheduled to inspect the Ningbo, Yuyao, and Daishan fields and production areas from the 2nd of this month to supervise and rectify.</p>
<p>▲The South Mountain of West Lake is famous for producing tea, and the North Mountain is known for producing bamboo shoots. The bamboo shoots in the North Mountain area have been damaged due to the long drought last winter, and the output this year has sharply reduced. It is already mid-spring, and each catty still costs about four corners. As for the tea fields in the South Mountain Longjing area, due to excessive winter snow, there is no hope for the picking of Mingqian (a tea name) before Qingming this year.</p>
<p>▲The Hangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, in accordance with the provincial order, has organized a construction fund management committee to issue construction bonds in the province. It is ordered to publicly elect one person, and also forward the order to the silver and money industries to each elect one person as a member of the committee. In addition to sending letters to the silver and money industries, it is also scheduled to hold a meeting at 2:00 PM on the 3rd of this month for public election.</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>A large number of refugees refuse to leave the country. At the Lu Cangmiao Temple outside the west market of Xinzhuang Town, a large number of refugees from other provinces suddenly arrived yesterday. There were many boats, and the number of men, women, old and young was no less than three or four hundred. The local people were very frightened. Therefore, Dai Yingfu, the patrol officer of the Public Security Bureau, led armed police officers, together with the local tu di bao (local officials), to provide travel expenses and persuaded them to leave the country. However, the refugees refused to accept the travel expenses and refused to leave the country. Therefore, several leaders of the refugees were detained in the Public Security Bureau and will be released when they leave the country. Police officers are dispatched day and night to monitor them to prevent any transgressive behavior. A clinic for epidemic diseases was established. In the countryside near Xinzhuang in western Shanghai, meningococcal inflammation is spreading very seriously. Therefore, Gu Qi, the district chief of the fourth district, consulted with Jin Qingzhang, the county magistrate, and allocated funds to organize a temporary hospital for rescue and prevention. It was approved to apply to Shanghai for three doctors. The Songjiang County Fourth District Temporary Epidemic Disease Clinic was established, with one chief physician and two assistant physicians in the Yingxin Nunnery in the east of the town. It was established and opened on the 1st of this month.</p>
<p>The Xinzhuang Town Security Group was abolished. The Xinzhuang Town Security Group was originally established for winter defense and expired on February 28th. The local agencies in the town dissolved and abolished the group.</p>
<p>A meeting to prepare for the construction of a new prison. The county government previously received a provincial order stating that the county prison was narrow and overcrowded, and that it was urgent to add twenty new prison cells to accommodate them. However, due to a lack of funds, it was necessary to raise funds to achieve this goal. On the afternoon of the 1st, County Magistrate Jin convened representatives of local groups to discuss the ways and means of carrying out the plan. The representatives agreed to raise donations. The county government issued donation registers to prove their credibility.</p>
<p>The captain of the water police supervises the army to block bandits. Last year, in the border area between Jinshan County, a neighboring county, and Zhejiang, the bandit leader Taibao A Shu was found leading a large group of bandits, looting everywhere. After the Jiangzhe water and land police teams jointly suppressed them, they fled into Taihu Lake and often extorted ransoms in Zhejiang. He Yalin, the captain of the Songshui Public Security Team, recently received a report that Taibao A Shu had again sneaked into the county from the Zhejiang waterway with about a hundred followers, eighty rifles and shotguns, and many hostages hidden in the boat. Captain He, fearing that they would cause trouble in the country, personally supervised the warship and rushed to various places near the Punan sea to patrol and suppress them. He has not yet returned.</p>
<p>Strange insects in the river cause suspicion and fear. At about 9:00 PM the night before last, there was a sound in the Cangqiao Tanhe River in the city, like a giant tide coming. People used electric torches to illuminate it, and they only saw thousands of centipede-like aquatic insects swimming in groups. The citizens spread the word, and all the viewers were surprised by this strange event. Those who were interested caught several of them, ranging in length from about a foot to several inches. The heads had tentacles and two eyes. The bodies were flat and round, with a gray back and a yellow belly, with some red ones. The spine had clear veins and countless slender feet, not as long as a centipede's. The tail was flat and released pulp from time to time. The Public Security Bureau also captured several of them to wait for chemical experiments. There was no poisonous substance. Tian Dan suddenly disappeared. Last night, they were also found in the river in the city and outside the east gate. Someone applied salt to their bodies and they immediately dissolved like pus. When their abdomens were dissected, there was white pulp inside. No one knows what this thing is, and it awaits the research of naturalists. However, at the time when meningitis was discovered, the strange objects were discovered at the same time, which caused a general sense of doubt among the people.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>The police team was transferred back for training. This county's police team was dispatched to various important towns and passes in various villages to suppress the tight winter defense last year. Now that the winter defense period has expired, Chief Gao has already submitted a request to the county government for the sake of emphasizing the education of the team members, ordering each sub-team to be transferred back to the urban area for training, which will be implemented on March 1.</p>
<p>The county-wide telephone is in progress. The county-wide long-distance telephone in this county has been planned by Director Qiu Xijue of the Construction Bureau and has been approved by the county government meeting. The entire county is divided into six lines: one Ji'an line, two Waihuang line, three Jiaxu line, four Jiaji line, five Xucao line, and six Chengguang line, with a total length of 110 li. It is estimated that it will cost 6,752 yuan. The county government has submitted it to the Department of Construction for approval. As soon as it is approved, construction will begin.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Banning the coffin houses from stopping coffins. The coffin houses in Nanqiao have a large number of coffins stopped for many years. Every summer, the odor is unpleasant, and the public entering and exiting the market in the west hinders sanitation. Last year, after the County Public Security Bureau moved to the Viling Gong Biediao Temple next door, the police officers suffered from epidemics and many died. County Magistrate Hong, in view of this, in addition to ordering the directors of the coffin houses to find a way to relocate, also stipulated measures to ban the stopping of coffins. He limited the County Public Security Bureau to bury the ownerless coffins or those who could not afford to bury them in charity organizations within one month. The coffins of the owners who have the ability to do so are limited to relocation, and those who fail to do so will be buried on their behalf, and the cost will still be repaid. The Li Bureau chief has been ordered to hurry up and deal with it properly.</p>
<p>Each district is investigating the household registration. The county government, in view of the occurrence of grain shortage in various villages, has specifically ordered the Yicang Committee to rush to handle a large amount of rice and grain for relief. Now, for the purpose of distributing the supplies, County Magistrate Hong compiled an investigation form yesterday and ordered each district to conduct a detailed investigation of the size of the poor households in each tu and report them separately for verification. It is said that after receiving the order, each district summoned each tu bao and each village chief yesterday, limiting the time to rush to do it. It is estimated that the relief will be provided by the end of March at the latest.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Assaulting his sister-in-law was sentenced to a fine. In the Baimatang area near Guanyintang in the eleventh district of Qing, a villager named Lü Yiyu had a conflict with his sister-in-law one day due to a trivial matter. At first, they quarreled, and then they fought. He even beat his sister-in-law in the head and face. Later, after mediation by others, the matter was settled. After a few days, Lü's sister-in-law was unable to relieve her resentment and cried to the Guanyintang Security Group about the previous situation. Wu Tuanzong ordered the parties to be summoned to the department to inquire about the beginning and end of the assault. Since Lü should not have assaulted his sister-in-law and the scars were still there, Lü was sentenced to a fine of five yuan, which was allocated as the medical expenses for his sister-in-law, and then each rested.</p>
<p>Stealing a plow cow instead caused trouble. Huang Laosi's son, Huang Peiyuan, who runs a rice store in Baihe Jiangzhen, Qing, and Xu Atao stole a plow cow from Qu Ayong's house the night before and sent it to his mother, Gu Heshang's house. The next day, the owner tracked it down. Gu pushed it away and blocked it, asking the owner to pay eight yuan to return the cow to the original owner. Unexpectedly, the two thieves instead caused trouble with the owner. The bystanders stood up for justice, so they told the owner to report to the town's security group. It happened that the head of the group was out on official business, and the staff of the group summoned all the witnesses to inquire. Xu Atao admitted it directly, and Huang Peiyuan's confession was cunning. As a result, Huang Xu and the relevant person Gu Heshang Gu Xiaodi were all taken to the county government for handling.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Another suspect in the robbery of Wuzhen was arrested. On the 23rd of last month, Du, the leader of the first squad of the 14th team of the 3rd district of the Water Public Security, found out that Ru Huanzhang, an important suspect in the robbery of Wuzhen, Zhejiang, was hiding at No. 6 Sijing Lane in the city. Du, the leader of the squad, led the detective to Suzhou and arrested Ru at the address. After verification by Captain Huai of the 14th team, he confessed that he was 35 years old and from Yingzhou, Anhui. He did not admit to the robbery of Wuzhen, but only knew that the bandit leaders Zheng Ngangda and Mao Zilong had a meeting to go to Zhejiang to commit crimes, and he did not know anything else. After Captain Huai made a confession, he sent the team members to escort Ru to Suzhou yesterday (the 1st) for the district chief to review and handle.</p>
<p>Civil and criminal lawsuits are actually priced higher. The High Court previously presented a request to the Ministry of Justice to sell civil and criminal lawsuits at a higher price in order to continue the repair due to the exhaustion of funds for the old prison. It was approved to allow the price of civil and criminal lawsuits to increase by 50% each from March 1. The price of the civilian complaint is 6.6 corners, and the current price is 9.6 corners. The original price of the criminal complaint was 3.2 corners, and the current price is 4.8 corners. A notice was issued yesterday.</p>
<p>The High Court searched for evidence in the Gao Ying case. The High Court is currently investigating evidence in the Gao Ying couple's trafficking in land. Because Gao completely pushed the matter of trafficking in land to his wife Liao Chengsu in his testimony during the first court hearing last year, the first step was to ask the Ministry of Justice to forward the investigation to Singapore to investigate the details of this case. What kind of relationship does Gao himself have? After receiving the reply telegram, the hearing will be scheduled to continue.</p>
<p>The new warden of the Third Sub-Prison took office. Since the chaos of the prison riot of more than a thousand prisoners in the Third Jiangsu Sub-Prison, after the resignation of Warden Zhang, the chief of the Third Section has been acting as the warden. Shao Runfen, the newly appointed warden, took office yesterday (the 1st). Cui Jingxi, the chief of the Second Section, resigned, and the vacancy was filled by Wang Zhiqing, the chief of the office.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Opposition to Metric Inspection of Raw Silk by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau: The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has decided to implement metric inspection of exported raw silk starting February 1st. Silk factories in the inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have held multiple meetings, and it is generally believed that whether metric inspection is beneficial to silk factories is still questionable. Various difficult problems have already arisen, so careful consideration should be given. It is impossible to implement it before various difficult problems are resolved. If the Inspection Bureau acts arbitrarily, disregarding the interests of silk merchants, the only option is to suspend business together and wait for a solution. Silk factories in Wuxi also believe that the implementation of metric inspection for raw silk exports is of great importance to the interests of silk merchants. If there is no thorough consideration beforehand and they blindly follow suit, there will inevitably be regrets. They should convene a meeting of all colleagues to discuss and unanimously oppose it, resolving to immediately send telegrams to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Commodity Inspection Bureau, requesting a temporary suspension of implementation to protect the silk industry. At the same time, they also telegraphed colleagues in silk factories in Shanghai and other places, stating the reasons for opposing metric inspection and requesting unified action. Subsequently, on the 26th, representatives of the silk industry in Shanghai, Wuxi, and Zhejiang met in Shanghai with Director Zou of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, holding a joint meeting for a long discussion. As the silk industry representatives insisted on their opposition, the meeting ended without results. The Wuxi Silk Factory Association received a reply from the Commodity Inspection Bureau the day before yesterday, stating that the metric inspection of factory silk exports is to maintain the fairness of transactions between both parties and has been implemented in various countries around the world for a long time. The date of implementation, March 1st, set by the Ministry and Bureau, cannot be delayed further and still asks for their utmost support, so that silk cocoons have the opportunity for innovation and efforts can be made for development. They immediately telegraphed Director Zou Bingwen of the Inspection Bureau, still requesting a temporary suspension. The original telegram stated, "Received your telegram. According to statistics reports from the Japanese Raw Silk Inspection Bureau, the seller must lose an average of seven or eight per thousand of net weight. Therefore, the implementation of this system is detrimental to our country's silk merchants and not beneficial. Moreover, the U.S. metric inspection is not mandatory. Now, Article 3 of the detailed rules states that all exported raw silk must be subject to metric inspection before it can be exported. This is mandatory enforcement, which is not practiced in other countries. Furthermore, the difficult problems in procedures have not been resolved, and our association's factories are not clear about the preparations made by your bureau. We should discuss it at length and postpone the implementation. If March 1st cannot be delayed any further, then our association's factories, for the sake of our own interests, have no choice but to find another solution. The telegram is urgent and awaiting orders." After this telegram was sent, there has been no reply yet, and colleagues in the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, because today (March 1st) is the date of implementation, on the 27th, decided to appoint Huang Jin Chen, Shen Hua Chen, Zhu Jing An, and Qian Sui Zhi as petition representatives, taking the night train to Beijing that evening, planning to petition the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the 28th. If there are no satisfactory results and the Inspection Bureau does not postpone, then the raw silk may even be prevented from being declared for export, and they have decided to suspend business together and wait for a solution.</p>
<p>Reasons for Suspension of Establishment of County Court: The establishment of a county court in this county has been delayed due to the difficulty in resolving the issue of the court site. We received news from the provincial government yesterday that Chief Judge Lin of the High Court had met with Director Miao of the Civil Affairs Department when he was in the province a few days ago to discuss the establishment of a county court in this county. At that time, Director Miao expressed his opinion, saying that it is quite convenient for the county government to concurrently handle judicial affairs in punishing bandits. If a court is established, it will inevitably be handled by the ordinary judiciary. Because after Changzhou established a county court, it felt difficult to punish bandits. Now, the gentry and merchants in that county are requesting the establishment of a local defense bureau to remedy the situation. Therefore, the establishment of a county court in Wuxi must be more appropriate after resolving these difficulties. Chief Judge Lin deeply</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>agreed, so the issue of establishing a court in this county must be included in the second phase. In addition, Dong Banggan, an adjudicator of this county, was ordered to be transferred to the Preparatory Committee of the Nantong County Court, and Yang Ji, an adjudicator of Wujiang County, was transferred to Wuxi to fill the vacancy. Mr. Yang is scheduled to come to Wuxi next Monday (3rd) to take over. It is heard that Mr. Dong is also scheduled to go to Nantong to take office within days.</p>
<p>Sending Prisoners to Yixing: Sun Zuji, the magistrate of this county, presented a request to the Jiangsu High Court to transfer twenty convicted prisoners to the Yixing County Prison because the county prison was overcrowded. At eight o'clock yesterday morning, he prepared an official document instructing Wu Zhengrong, the chief of political police, to send police to escort them to Yixing by boat for imprisonment.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony of the Farmers Bank: Gu Shuzhi had been appointed as director of the Fourth District Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank by Wang Zhixin, the manager of the provincial bank. Preparations have been completed, and the office is located in Zhuchang Lane, Tonghui Bridge. Yesterday was the opening day, and a swearing-in ceremony was held for the director. Zhang Shouyong, the director of the Department of Finance, and He Yushu, the director of the Department of Agriculture and Mining, personally went to Wuxi to oversee the swearing-in.</p>
<p>Disputes over Feast Donation Continue: The Education Bureau of Wuxi County had previously planned to organize an education feast donation, which had been approved by the National Central University and filed with the Department of Education. It was also approved by the county government meeting and forwarded by the Department of Education to the Department of Finance for submission to the provincial government meeting for approval. Then, the Department ordered compliance to start the process. However, the First District Office, in the name of raising funds for autonomous administration, presented a request to the county to organize an autonomous administration feast donation and advertised to invite restaurants to register with the district. Yesterday, they submitted separate requests to the Department of Education and the county government, requesting a strict order to stop it, so as to correct the discipline and maintain education. Qian Zhongliang, the head of the First District, also went to the province yesterday to meet with Miao, the Director of Civil Affairs, to strongly argue for this donation. Some restaurant owners also went to the Department of Civil Affairs to submit a request, willing to pay the autonomous administration feast donation. Both sides are engaging in intrigue, and it is unknown how to resolve it.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Robbery and Injury in Gaochang Township: Gu Canhai's home in Gaochang Township, Fourth District of Wu County, was suddenly invaded by twenty bandits the night before last. At that time, the head and feet of the victim, Gu Canhai, were injured, and dozens of pieces of leather robes, cotton-padded jackets, and single clothes were robbed. By the time the nearby security team heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, the bandits had escaped.</p>
<p>The County Court President Was Sworn In: Wu Zenshan, the president of the Wu County Court, and Xu Hailing, the chief prosecutor, were sworn in on March 1. Lin Biao, the president of the High Court, and Wang Simao, the chief prosecutor, were the oath overseers. According to President Wu, the issue of lawyers appearing in court will soon be resolved. There are many lawsuits in Wu County, and it is necessary to inform the Ministry of Justice to appoint one more judge. In the future, it may be necessary to change it to a district court.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Disputes over Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Soldier Fields: The Ministry of Military Affairs sent Secretary Ye Zhendong to Tong to cooperate with County Magistrate Chen in handling the case of Tonghai Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company encroaching on the soldier fields of the Su Zhen and Langshan Battalions. The manager of the company was ordered to pay the price according to the current value. If he failed to do so within the deadline, it was proposed to take back the land and auction it off. Currently, the company has decided through a general meeting of shareholders to oppose the above-mentioned disposal and resolve the matter according to legal procedures. It has accused the informant, Yu Bujiu, of false accusation and submitted a report to the county government, requesting a postponement of execution. County Magistrate Chen specially submitted a report to the Ministry of Military Affairs for verification.</p>
<p>County Government Interrogates Bandit Leader of Yuxi: Zhuang Dianchen, the bandit leader of Yuxi, committed many crimes. After escaping to Shanghai, he was captured by the police. The Nantong County Government sent police to escort him back to Tong. He was interrogated by County Magistrate Chen on the afternoon of the 27th for three hours and confessed to his crimes.</p>
<p>More Than One Hundred Zhang of the Riverbank Collapse: The Nantong Riverbank has recently been severely impacted by the changing direction of the river flow. Due to the strong winds and rain in recent days, more than one hundred and sixty zhang of the riverbank in the Pupu Port area have collapsed, and the collapse is intensifying.

<p>Educational News Highlights</p>
<h3>The Forthcoming Visit to China of French Dr. Magouliès</h3>
<p>Dr. Magouliès Is Proficient in Chinese</p>
<p>His Visit to China Has Two Purposes:</p>
<p>To Study Chinese Language Teaching Methods</p>
<p>To Examine Equivalent Academic Credentials</p>
<p>Paris Correspondence: The French Ministry of Education has dispatched Dr. Magouliès (DR·GOOPGEMRARGULIES) to China for inspection. He is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in mid-January. Before Dr. Magouliès' departure, the reporter visited his residence at 98 Rue de Grenelle, Paris, one day prior to his departure. Dr. Magouliès was out when the reporter arrived, and the servant led the reporter into his study. The walls were lined with Chinese books, filling the shelves. At a glance, it was evident that the owner of the room was deeply immersed in Sinology. Soon after, Dr. Magouliès entered the room, wearing a bow tie and a brown suit. He looked energetic and had a heroic spirit in his calmness. Upon shaking hands, he greeted the reporter cordially and apologized for his late return. When asked about the purpose of his visit to China, Dr. Magouliès replied that he was commissioned by the Ministry of Education to travel to China. His primary purpose was to study the teaching methods of Chinese literature. He stated that learning Chinese is not easy, especially for foreigners. Therefore, it is necessary to come to China and study the teaching methods of Chinese literature in person so that the teaching methods can be improved in the future, making it easier for Chinese language learners to understand. His other purpose is to address the issue of "equivalent academic credentials." According to the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education the year before last, foreign university preparatory and undergraduate graduates are recognized as eligible to directly enter French universities. On the Chinese side, only Aurora University in Shanghai and the Harbin Commercial School are recognized, and both are preparatory schools. No Chinese university graduates are eligible to directly enter doctoral programs in French universities. This visit to China aims to investigate whether any Chinese schools have equivalent standards so that the Ministry of Education can be requested to recognize them as having equivalent academic credentials, allowing graduates to directly enter without any further procedures. (Reporter's note: In recent years, many Chinese students applying to Parisian universities, even with domestic university diplomas, have often been rejected, leaving them in a dilemma. The domestic educational authorities should also pay attention to this.)</p>
<h3>French Dr. Magouliès (The four characters of Magouliès above were written by Dr. Ma himself.)</h3>
<p>I</p>
<p>in China for a month, or more, or a year. He plans to spend more time in Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and other places. The reporter briefly described the state of Chinese education and pointed out that many private schools have excellent performance and should be noted. At this point, the reporter intended to discuss other matters, but since there were other guests present, the reporter bid farewell. Dr. Magouliès presented a recent photograph as a gift. His handwriting of the characters "Magouliès" is vigorous and upright, which is unusual for a foreigner.</p>
<p>Dr. Magouliès' Biography: Dr. Magouliès, also known as Xuanbo, was born on May 13, 1902. In 1919, he entered the National School of Oriental Languages. In 1922, he graduated from the Chinese Studies Department of the same school. In 1923, he obtained a Master of Arts degree from the Faculty of Arts of the University of Paris. In the same year, he went to England to study Chinese and practice English. He then returned to Paris and continued his studies at the University of Paris. In 1924, he was appointed to the Chinese Department of the library of the School of Oriental Languages. The school has a large collection of Chinese books, which further enhanced Dr. Magouliès' knowledge. In 1926, he obtained a Doctorate of Arts degree from the Faculty of Arts of the University of Paris. His dissertation topics included classical Chinese literature and the Fu genre in the Wen Xuan. In the same year, he began teaching Chinese literature history at the School of Oriental Languages. In 1927, he took Chinese books to open a Chinese book exhibition in Frankfurt, Germany, which was very successful. In addition to his dissertation, Dr. Magouliès has also authored a translation of Yanzi Fu and a History of Chinese Prose, published in 1929. (Dr. Magouliès will write another book on criticism of Chinese literature). Dr. Magouliès is proficient in Russian, French, English, German, and Siberian languages. He has also studied Japanese and can read Latin. He has extensive knowledge of Chinese books and can also compose rhythmic prose, which is quite interesting. His desire to come to China was determined in 1925, and now it has been realized. He has a very good impression of the Chinese people. When Grand Master Taixu came to the West to propagate Buddhism and when Zhang Boling, the president of Nankai University, passed through Europe, Dr. Magouliès provided great assistance and even served as an interpreter in person.

<h3>Circular of the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>Urging the Reporting of Statistics on School-Age Children for the Seventeenth Year</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education yesterday (the 28th) issued a circular to the education departments of all provinces, the education bureaus of special municipalities, and the Qinghai Provincial Government, urging them to promptly report statistics on school-age children for the seventeenth year, and to expedite the statistics for the eighteenth year. "It has been found that the Ministry previously sent investigation forms, statistical tables, and instructions on the procedures for compiling statistics on school-age children for the seventeenth year to the departments and bureaus concerned, ordering them to reprint them in accordance with the forms, distribute them to their subordinates, and follow the procedures. The statistics were to be compiled and sent to the Ministry before August 1. If any subordinate bodies failed to comply with the order, they were to be strictly supervised to ensure that the deadline for reporting to the Ministry was not missed. Now that the seventeenth year has long ended, it has been found that most of the statistics have not yet been reported. The departments and bureaus concerned should be urged separately. In addition to issuing separate orders, the departments and bureaus are hereby ordered to follow the instructions, forward them to their subordinates, and promptly report the statistical tables. Do not delay any further. The statistics for the eighteenth year should also be prepared in accordance with the regulations and forwarded to the Ministry as early as possible."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Wang Keren to Assume the Position of Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Orders the Organization of Primary School Education Research Associations</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department considers the Primary School Education Research Association to be a matter of urgency for elementary education and has issued a circular to all counties and cities, setting a deadline for its organization. The circular states: "It has been reported that the second meeting of the Joint Association of Attached Primary Schools of Provincial Secondary Schools resolved to establish Primary School Education Research Associations in each county by a deadline. It was stated that the Education Administration and Education Counseling System Chart of Zhejiang Province, compiled by the former National Zhejiang University, stated that the Joint Conference of Education Administration Personnel in Secondary School Districts is the education counseling agency for each secondary school district, and the Primary School Education Research Association is the education counseling agency for each county. Now that the Joint Conference of Education Administration Personnel in each secondary school district is continuing to be held, the incomplete establishment and organization of the Primary School Education Research Association in each county is undoubtedly a defect in the education counseling system. How can we counsel each primary school to improve education? Therefore, this association requests the Education Department to issue a circular to each county education bureau, requiring them to establish the Primary School Education Research Association in each county by January 19, to lay the foundation for implementing counseling. It is believed that the Primary School Education Research Association is of great importance to the improvement of primary school education. Those that have not yet been established should be organized as soon as possible for joint research. It is hereby ordered that the county and municipal governments instruct the education bureaus to investigate and report the establishment of the Primary School Education Research Association in each county this year without further delay."</p>

<h3>Today's Yuehua vs. Huosaisi Game</h3>
<p>3 PM at Shen Garden</p>
<p>Yuehua has failed twice, slightly tarnishing its reputation. Its players have been through many battles and have never been concerned with winning or losing. Having been defeated by the mediocre Navy team in the past, they may launch a fierce attack on the strong Huosaisi team today to show their great spirit and superior skills. The only concern is that Ping Yunyou's leg injury has not yet healed, and Li Huitang may be transferred to the inside, which may inevitably reduce the shooting power of the forwards. However, it is worth noting that Chen Yutian, who is as light as a swallow and as fast as a steed, will appear on the field and show his ability. The game between the two teams will be held at Shen Garden at 3 PM today and is one scene of the Western Association A-League game. The referee is McSherry.</p>
<h3>Zhonghua Football Club's Zhong-Character Group Champion Securely Held by Hujiang</h3>
<p>Yesterday's 7-2 Victory Over Youyou</p>
<p>The Hujiang University and Youyou football teams, who are equally famous in the Zhong-Character Group of the Zhonghua Football Club, met at the Zhonghua Baseball Field at 3 PM yesterday for the important final game of the group. Referee Le Xiurong, linesmen Yu Hengzhi and Xi Qiaosheng. After a fierce battle, Hujiang won 7-2 and can securely win the Zhong-Character Group championship.</p>
<p>In yesterday's game, the Yangshupu players were as lively as dragons and tigers, performing wonderfully. The left and right wings passed and crossed the ball to the best of their abilities. The three midfielders were brave in the face of battle, their arms linked together, and the internal defense was tight, like a golden city and iron wall. Among the warriors, there were three who made the most contributions: inside player Li Ningzhong, Hu Minteng, and forward Huang Jiaoyan. Youyou is indeed assembled from temporary celebrities and strong generals, and its strength has always been considerable. However, yesterday, the defenders repeatedly failed to fulfill their duties, causing the morale of the entire army to decline and the spirits of each player to be dispersed. However, Sun Xingyan's shooting, Shao Yueping's picking, and Ye Jinmian's defense were still able to show their skills and deal with the enemy despite the pressure.</p>
<p>Hujiang, with the wind and sun at their backs, advanced to attack. Youyou rejected people thousands of miles away and defended as an attack. After a dozen rounds, Hujiang's Hu Minteng sent a long pass, and the five forwards rushed forward. Both sides dragged water and mud, competing with each other. Dai Linzhen kicked the ball suddenly, and the defender inadvertently blocked it, still seeing it enter the net and being filled with sorrow. After that, Youyou's Sun Xingyan picked the ball from the right and crossed it. Yang Weiren was in the right position but failed to head it accurately, losing the opportunity to recover. The second chance soon came when Zhang Xien sacrificed himself to pass the ball, and Shi Youhui followed closely, but was blocked by Hu Minteng. The ball lost its direction in front of the goal, and for a moment it was like a storm suddenly arriving, fierce and terrifying. The people in the game were like fools and madmen, and the onlookers were frightened. Then, Hujiang's defender raised his arm and the ball flew far away, turning danger into safety. Hu Minteng fought regardless of his own safety, causing his head to be injured and bleeding profusely. After being bandaged, he still returned to the field. At that time, he had already dedicated himself to the team and did not care about his own safety. In the last ten minutes, Hujiang scored two more goals in a row. The first goal was shot by Hujiang's center forward Huang Jiaoyan. The fault was again in the defender's misjudgment, and the second goal was initially a collaboration between Qian Jingyong and Liu Xinghua to penetrate deep into the enemy territory, and then Dai Linzhen pushed the boat along the water and hit the ball into the goal. In the first half, Hujiang took a 3-0 lead.</p>
<p>In the second half, Youyou's veteran right wing Shao Yueping came on the field. Not long after the kickoff, Shao Yueping showed his courage and drove straight in, full of energy, not diminishing his past glory. A ball was passed in the middle, right on the mark. The defender failed to catch it, and Xu Zhenguo mistakenly put it into his own net. Youyou's goal was due to Xu's mistake, directly, and Shao's picking indirectly. From then on, Youyou was greatly disappointed. Whether it was passing, shooting, fighting, or defending, they were inferior to the opponent. Seeing that half of the country was occupied by enemy troops, at ten minutes, Li Ning remotely attacked a ball, which was caught by the defender. Huang Jiaoyan flew up to retrieve it, and the defender lost color and fell to the ground, eventually being knocked in by Huang, making it 4-1. Not long after, Qian Jingyong knocked on the gate three times, and finally succeeded in returning, making it 5-1. Li Ning sent the ball far forward again, and Huang entered the gate alone again, making it 6-1. Before long, Hu Minteng kicked in a twelve-yard penalty kick, making it 7-1. Youyou made a final effort, and Sun Xingyan hit a goal, making the difference 7-2. The result of the day was thus determined.</p>

<p>Set to Compete with Germany's Schmeling for the Title</p>

They compete with each other, with the winner prevailing. Three fighters have emerged victorious: America's Jack Sharkey, England's Phil Scott, and Germany's Max Schmeling.

<h3>Unprecedented High Price of Silver</h3>
<p>Five Hundred Nineteen Taels and Five Mace</p>
<p>Due to the continuous decline in silver prices, the price of silver has been rising accordingly, reaching unprecedented highs. Unexpectedly, silver prices fell again yesterday morning in both London and New York. In addition, the Indian government imposed an import tax of four annas (Indian currency) per ounce of raw silver, causing the price of silver to skyrocket to an unprecedented high of five hundred nineteen taels and five mace. The market closed at a price of five hundred seventeen taels and nine mace. After the market opened in the morning, banks were eager to close deals due to numerous orders from importers and actively purchased silver. Fortunately, there were many bullish Chinese speculators who took profits, reaching around 500,000 pounds, so the market did not completely collapse. Otherwise, if speculators had competed with importers, the market would have plummeted uncontrollably. Some people say that, given the current situation, the government must reconsider imposing an import tax on raw silver or implementing other import restrictions. If there is no effective way to save the situation, the harm would be unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Citywide Congress Held</h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony Held in the Morning</p>
<p>Executive and Supervisory Committee Members Elected in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The Sixth Shanghai Municipal Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) held its opening ceremony at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Present were Central Representative Chu Minyi, Election Supervisor Wu Baofeng, Chief of Staff Lai, representing the Garrison Command, Yu Hongjun, representing the municipal government, the current Executive and Supervisory Committee member Xiong Shihui, and over a hundred city representatives. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Congress Staff: Presidium: Chen Dezheng, Fan Zhengbo, Pan Gongzhan, Xiong Shihui (nominated by the Municipal Executive Committee), Wu Kaixian, Tong Xingbai, Yang Qingyuan, Wang Yansong, Chen Junyi (nominated by the Congress); Secretary-General: Tao Baichuan; Stenographers: Xu Xingchu, Huang Xianggu.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Chen Dezheng reported, stating the following: "Central Representative, fellow comrades, distinguished guests, today we are holding the Sixth Municipal Congress. We remember that last year, about twenty days earlier than this year, we held the Fifth Municipal Congress. We also remember that today last year was the day the Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee elected by the Fifth Municipal Congress began their work. Therefore, today is a very memorable day for the municipal party headquarters. It is very appropriate and meaningful to hold the Sixth Municipal Congress on this memorable day. We know that the Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee is being convened in the capital. The Third Plenary Session will undoubtedly make excellent decisions regarding the national plan and the suppression of the rebellion. When we think of the efforts of the Central Government, we feel that our efforts should also follow the leaders of the Central Government and strive together. Therefore, we feel that holding the Sixth Municipal Congress today is even more meaningful. Looking back on the work of the past year, we know that the steps of the work and the usual achievements are closely related to the surrounding environment. Therefore, before talking about the work of the past year, I must briefly describe the environment in which we have been in the past year. Last year, after the end of the Reorganization and Consolidation Conference, it aroused the jealousy of some reactionary military personnel, and even more exposed the conspiracies of these reactionary military personnel. Therefore, one after another, there were mutinies by reactionary military personnel. First, there was the rebellion of the Guangxi warlords, then the rebellion of Zhang Fakui and Feng Yuxiang, and later the rebellion of Tang Shengzhi. Now, it is very clear that the remnant warlords supported by the remnant feudal forces want to disturb China and shake the foundation of the nation. The facts of rebellious speeches and actions have been announced to everyone. Therefore, a careful look at the environment in the past year shows that two-thirds of the time was shrouded in the rebellion of reactionary warlords. Originally, the Central Government had established a very good plan to train the people through political means, but who knew that the rebellion of reactionary military personnel would shatter the entire plan of the Central Government. We feel very distressed when we think of the environment in the past year. In addition to the rebellion of reactionary military personnel, there is another thing that is also very noteworthy, that is, some unscrupulous scholars have been constantly slandering our party and undermining the revolution, hoping to shake the public's faith in our party. Hu Shi is a representative of them. This kind of ideological reaction, like the reaction of the military in politics, is equally damaging to the nation. Reaction also occupies a part. In addition to the military rebellion and ideological reaction, the state of the domestic economy is also very worthy of our attention. Recently, many factories in this city have completely closed down, and many other industries are almost on the verge of bankruptcy. Moreover, because China still uses the silver standard, and the tael and yuan are used together without a standard, when the trend of expensive gold and cheap silver occurs, the domestic economy suffers great damage, forming economic difficulties that make the comrades in the city feel very vigilant. This can also be said to be a part of the environment last year. Therefore, the environment in the past year can be summarized as follows: first, in politics, there were rebellions and disturbances by reactionary military personnel; second, in ideology, there was the destruction and conspiracy of shameless scholars; third, in the economy, there was a great crisis lurking. From these three environments, we can see that most of our work is used in these three aspects. In politics, we have used all our strength to work under the leadership of the Central Government to suppress the rebellion. In ideology, we have also used all our strength to eliminate the source of ideological chaos. In the economy, we have used great strength to help the government and earnestly alleviate economic difficulties. The work we have done in the past year, due to the environment, has only done three major parts of the negative aspects. Because of this, the love and sincerity among comrades cannot be well trained, so that the knowledge among comrades cannot be well discussed, so that the actions of comrades cannot be well supervised, so that the thoughts among comrades cannot be well exchanged, so that many obvious shortcomings have occurred among comrades in the past year. Although everyone has common belief, there has not been a good cultivation in mutual trust. This is what the past facts have told us. Looking back now, it is really very painful. At the same time, we also realized that in the past year, a small part of the comrades, regardless of their personal integrity and integrity, have done many things that should not be done. This makes us feel very sad when we look back. Secondly, in the repeated rebellions, we have also found a shortcoming, that is, the comrades are too impatient, lack patience, and cannot calmly deal with all kinds of things. This is also a big shortcoming. Another point is that a small part of the comrades only care about personal freedom and ignore the freedom of the entire party. Therefore, many violations of discipline have occurred. The most common ones are two problems: first, the actions among comrades are too romantic; second, the thoughts and behaviors are too immature. Because of the waste of action, it has caused suspicion and resentment among the public. Because of the immaturity of thought, many things are either done too excessively or not done well enough. These many past shortcomings make us very vigilant when we think about them today. We must think of future methods from the past memories. This is what the Congress should consider and study today. Therefore, before the meeting, the brothers specially put forward a few points for your reference. First, what we think of is the issue of integrity. If a revolutionary party cannot take integrity and integrity as the premise of establishing the party, the foundation of the party cannot be stable, and the foundation of the nation will also be shaken. Chinese people have always emphasized integrity and integrity, but in recent years, due to the incitement and disruption of the Communist Party, integrity and integrity have been lost without residue. Now we must re-receive this treasure. We must have a good cultivation of integrity and integrity. We can say that we would rather sacrifice our lives for righteousness than greed for life and abandon our aspirations. This is the first point. The second point we think of is two very important sentences. These two sentences not only often encourage the colleagues of the Municipal Executive Committee, but also should often encourage all the comrades in the city, that is, do not take ill-gotten gains when facing wealth, and do not try to avoid danger when facing difficulties. If we can encourage each other with these two sentences, one comrade like this, every comrade like this, then the foundation of the party will not be shaken by others in any way, and the future of the revolution is also very promising. The third point we think of is the cultivation of comrades' knowledge. We know that reading should not forget the revolution, and the revolution should have good knowledge. If a revolutionary party has no knowledge, it will become a straw bag, specializing in causing trouble and unable to shoulder major revolutionary responsibilities. From now on, we must work hard to learn for the revolution. These two points are all about comrades. As for the party, we should, under the leadership of the Central Government, fundamentally eliminate the rebels of all feudal forces. Furthermore, we should actively engage in political construction. As for all political construction and the exploration of the party's theory, the research and propaganda of doctrine, and the implementation and strictness of the party's organization, we have already worked very hard in the past. In the future, we should work even harder. When the Sixth Municipal Congress is held, we have many feelings and also increase many difficulties. We feel that the difficulties of the past environment are only worth comforting, that is, our work is still relatively hard. The many shortcomings and many practical difficulties must be discussed and resolved by the Congress today. We are very happy and sincerely wish the Sixth Municipal Congress success, and wish the Sixth Municipal Congress a complete result." Completed.</p>
<p>Central Admonition: Central Representative Chu Minyi admonished, "Chairman, fellow representatives, today I am very pleased to represent the Central Government and attend the Sixth Municipal Congress of this city. We know that the Municipal Congress is the highest organ of the party in the city. Today, there are 65 representatives from all districts in this city, and 64 have attended, which is almost the entire body. This proves that all comrades are enthusiastic and clear about their responsibilities to the party. All representatives are outstanding members of their respective districts and can also be said to be representatives of all sectors of this city. Compared with the Fifth Congress last year, I feel that there has been even more progress. We should review the past work. If we find any mistakes, we should try to correct them. We must also consider the current environment and plan our future work from a positive perspective, so that the next Executive and Supervisory Committee members will have something to follow. As for the election of the next Executive and Supervisory Committee members, we should conduct thorough investigations and must elect responsible comrades to fill the positions. Then the party affairs will have even better results in the future. Now the reactionary elements are eager to move, which is an opportunity for us to fight. I hope that all comrades can understand their important responsibilities and work hard for them."</p>
<p>Preparatory Process: Secretary-General Tao Baichuan of the Congress reported, saying briefly, "Fellow comrades, the Secretariat of the Congress was established in accordance with Article 3 of the Congress Organization Law. After I was elected as the Secretary-General, I immediately appointed working comrades to start working. Because the time is tight, the work is quite busy. The rules for proposals and the rules of procedure for the Congress have also been stipulated, and a daily newspaper of the Congress has been compiled and printed. There is a lot of important reference material inside. As for the schedule of the Congress, the Secretariat has arranged it according to the resolution of the Municipal Executive Committee. If you need to visit various agencies in groups on the third day, you can notify the Secretariat to do so. Furthermore, the Qualification Review Committee and the Proposal Review Committee have held meetings in the past month. More than 80 proposals have been received, and many of those that passed the review have been arranged on the agenda and will be discussed at the meeting on the 4th."</p>

<h3>Two Important Telegrams from the Municipal Representatives' Congress</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, at the Shanghai Special Municipality's Sixth Municipal Representatives' Congress, an opening ceremony was held. Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Chen Dezheng, and others urgently proposed: (1) to telegraph the Central Government requesting a clear order to punish Yan [Xishan]; (2) to telegraph support for the Third Plenum of the Central Executive Committee. Both proposals were unanimously approved by all representatives. The original telegrams are recorded below: (1) Telegram requesting the Central Government to issue a clear order to punish Yan [Xishan], addressed to the Central Executive Committee, Third Plenary Session: Since Yan Xishan unilaterally issued the [telegraph of] protest, he has acted as if he were mad, and the whole country has risen up to denounce him, holding him accountable to discipline, and making him aware of the advantages and disadvantages [of his actions]. Not only does Yan not understand himself, but he stubbornly argues and isolates himself from the Party and the country. Now, he is even using Chen Shilu to probe the situation. He feigns the name of politeness and courtesy, but in reality, he carries out the betrayal of the revolution. With his true intentions finally revealed, what excuses does he have? Your esteemed committee bears the heavy responsibility entrusted to it by the people of the whole country. Eliminating bandits and punishing evildoers is your undeniable duty. Yan's feudal mindset as an "earth emperor" who has been in power for 19 years, and the shadow of his acceptance of Hongxian's offer to divide the land and grant titles, are still vivid in people's minds. Looking back and considering the present, what is there to discuss with him about the Party, the country, or ideology? This committee, at today's Congress, made a resolution and submitted it to your esteemed committee: (1) to permanently expel Yan Xishan from the Party; (2) to swiftly instruct the National Government to immediately rectify the military and issue a declaration to punish him. We will see the swift and complete destruction, and a return to normalcy in a short time. A brave man cutting off his wrist endures the pain for a moment. The fate of the world, whether good or bad, depends on this one action. This committee respectfully makes this request on behalf of three million citizens. We ask your esteemed committee to resolutely act on it. The Sixth Municipal Representatives' Congress of the Kuomintang, Shanghai Special Municipality, respectfully submits. (2) Telegram supporting the Second and Third Plenums of the Central Executive Committee, addressed to the Central Executive Committee, Third Plenary Session, Nanjing: The country is in crisis. The Central Government in Nanjing, at its Third Plenary Session, is deeply aware of the severity of the international situation and the suffering of the people, who are in dire straits. It is diligently adhering to the teachings of the late Premier and upholding the policy of peaceful unification, hoping to elevate China to a realm of freedom and equality. However, reactionary elements, fearing the loss of their feudal power, do not hesitate to engage in acts of betraying the Party and disrupting the country in order to satisfy their selfish desires. Now, the Third Plenary Session has already opened, and party leaders have gathered in the capital. In the future, the major affairs of the Party and the country will surely have more definite plans to seek the welfare of the nation and the people. This committee, therefore, leads the citizens of the whole city and respectfully offers its utmost sincerity in support. However, in addition to the joy and excitement, we would also like to offer a humble suggestion to the committees of your esteemed committee, hoping that you will consider and adopt it. Revolutionaries can only move forward bravely and strive diligently. There is no room for politeness, no room for hypocrisy, and even less room for feudal territorial thinking. In Shanxi, there is an "earth emperor" named Yan Xishan, whose thinking is outdated. He initially did not know what revolution was. After the founding of the Republic of China, he had long been separated from the Party. During the Northern Expedition, he opportunistically joined and provided assistance. In the past three years, he has manipulated and exploited [the situation] for his own benefit. He suddenly, at this time when unification has just been achieved, first made excuses of politeness and courtesy to coerce the revolutionary leader of our Party, Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, to step down. Then, he advocated convening a joint meeting of the Central Committee and its affiliated supervisory committees, and even colluded with all reactionary elements, hoping to organize a "Council of Elders" and other institutions to form another government and overthrow the Party's rule. Absurd theories abound, and dangerous words are heeded. He is ignorant of the overall situation and violates the law. In terms of his crimes, he is not only betraying the Party but also destroying the Party. Examining his intentions, he is actually trying to recreate internal strife and plunge our people into a state of misery from which they can never recover. This committee deeply believes that Yan Xishan is full of evil and deserves to die. We should ask the various committees of the Congress to unanimously decide to dispatch troops to punish the rebels and eliminate the source of disaster for the people. Only then can the implementation of disbandment and reorganization be expected, and the peaceful unification be hopeful. As for all other counter-revolutionary elements, they should also be eliminated within a limited time to clear the obstacles in the revolutionary path. This is the first thing that this committee hopes your esteemed committee will adopt and implement. Now that political tutelage has begun, all levels of Party organizations across the country should work hard to educate the people through politics. On the one hand, they should urge the government to ensure that politics is on the right track. On the other hand, they should lead the people to develop the ability to exercise the four powers. Therefore, the Party organizations during the period of political tutelage have a more important and practical responsibility than those engaged in propaganda work during the military administration period. However, observing the Party organizations at all levels across the country, most of them are negligent and derelict in their work of training the people in their respective regions. Although the reasons are not one-sided, the lack of a definite plan and a basis for action are also a major cause. Although the principles of the National People's Movement have long been established, the implementation plan has not yet been formulated. For example, the implementation plan for the Seven Movements has been assigned to specialists to be responsible for the design, but the results of the design have not yet been announced. For the present plan, we can only ask the Central Government to quickly formulate an implementation plan for the training of the people, so that Party organizations at all levels across the country can rely on it to train the people's ability to exercise the four powers and realize true democracy. This is the second thing that this committee hopes your esteemed committee will adopt and implement. Our Party's foreign policy has long been stipulated in the declaration of the First National Congress. However, the diplomatic actions before today were still in the military administration period, which was only enough to cope with the environment and could not be considered a fundamental way to implement foreign policy. Therefore, the work of abolishing unequal treaties has not yet achieved satisfactory results. Observing the crux of the problem, it is because those in charge of diplomacy still lack precise strategies. In order to seek diplomatic victory, we should first decide on the future diplomatic strategy, so that we will have a clear plan in mind and can gradually implement it to achieve the goal of removing all shackles. This is the third thing that this committee hopes your esteemed committee will adopt and implement. As for other major revolutionary tasks, we especially hope that the committees of your esteemed committee will use the strongest determination and the spirit of fearlessness to supervise all Party members and lead the people of the whole country to work together to realize the Three People's Principles, relieve the Chinese nation from its plight, and establish the foundation of a great world commonwealth. Looking forward to the wind, with endless desires to express, this special telegram is respectfully submitted. We hope that you will consider and examine it carefully. The Sixth Municipal Representatives' Congress of the Kuomintang, Shanghai Special Municipality, respectfully submits.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government's Suggestions for the Third Plenum</h3>
<p>Submitting Four Proposals</p>
<p>The Third Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee convened yesterday. In order to improve the treatment of workers and unify educational administration, the Municipal Government drafted four proposals: (1) a proposal for unifying the authority to handle labor-management disputes; (2) a proposal for organizing labor welfare undertakings; (3) a proposal for relief for unemployed workers; (4) a proposal for unifying the educational administrative power of special municipalities. It is said that the explanations for these proposals were sent to the secretariat of the committee in a letter the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce and Industry Presents Opinions on Revising Tax Regulations</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce and Industry submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "Reporting on the imminent revision of national tax regulations, we respectfully submit the opinions of various industries regarding tax regulations, requesting your review and implementation. Since the customs import tariff has been bound by agreements for more than eighty years, it has only recently begun to implement a seven-level differential tax based on the actual situation, which is the initial step in restoring sovereignty. However, its content is still based on the draft of the Beijing Customs Conference, and the methods are not without compromise, which is still far from the goal of complete customs autonomy and protecting industry. Your ministry, in view of this, has recently taken the initiative to revise the tax regulations. The industries regard this as an opportunity for commercial revival and are thinking of presenting as much as possible their experiences over the years, hoping to assist your ministry. It is the duty of this chamber to convey commercial information and we dare not take this lightly. We respectfully present it to your ministry in detail. (1) (Liquor industry) According to reports, since foreign liquor has become popular in recent years, the sales of local Taixing spirits have declined sharply. In Shanghai alone, it has been reduced to one-tenth of its former sales. Foreign liquor can be mixed with two parts of water for every part of liquor and sold as three parts. It is still strong, but has no flavor, therefore it must be mixed with local Taixing spirits. Upon investigation, the import tariff for this liquor should be at least 200%. Since every part of liquor is mixed with two parts of water and sold as three parts, the actual tax levied, divided by three, is still only slightly more than 66%, which is far from the 350% tax on Japanese cigarettes. (2) (Umbrella industry) According to reports, although the sales of Western umbrellas have declined due to boycotts in recent years, Eastern umbrellas are sold at low prices and flood the market. Most Chinese umbrella factories are small-capitalized and poorly organized, and are being squeezed out and unable to sustain themselves. It is proposed that foreign goods be taxed at the highest rate among luxury goods. Chinese umbrellas and accessories should be exempt from taxes when exported or sold domestically. Otherwise, a minimum export tax should be levied, and no further donations or taxes should be collected in any name thereafter. (3) (Tea industry) According to reports, the government has newly formulated three types of tax reduction methods for the tea industry. The industry believes that the second method (B) formulated by the government is the most appropriate. Traditionally, tea produced in Anhui, in addition to the donations and taxes paid locally, is subject to import duties when transported to the Zhejiang border (Weiping area), and each piece must be taken out of the boat and weighed. Other checkpoints along the way often want to levy additional donations, claiming that the previous donations were insufficient. By the time it reaches the Zhejiang customs, it must pay the full import duty. Once it reaches Jiangsu, it must pay the Jiangsu import landing donation and other donations, which are numerous and exorbitant. Therefore, the industry supports Method B, which states that all domestically produced rough tea transported for sale within the country should be subject to a one-time collection of donations and taxes by the local customs or tax bureau in the producing province. Thereafter, it can be transported throughout the country, verified by a manifest, and released without collecting any further donations or taxes. The tax grades should be divided into four categories: top tea, middle tea, bottom tea, tea stems, and tea dust. The set donation rates should be: one yuan per dan for top tea, five jiao per dan for middle tea, two jiao five fen per dan for bottom tea, and one jiao per dan for tea stems and tea dust. However, the exact tax rates will still be determined by the government. The industry declares that it does not consider the proposed donation rates above as a fixed claim. This chamber believes that the situation described by the industry is not entirely within the scope of customs import tariffs, but it is not without mutual relevance. Therefore, it is submitted together. Except for the proposal to reduce the import tax on jade and abolish the import tax exemption for wheat flour, which have been submitted separately, all the proposed tax methods for foreign liquor, umbrellas and tea are reasonably compiled and submitted to your ministry for review and approval, and the implementation of the policy would be convenient and fair."</p>
<h3>Imported Rice on the Rise</h3>
<p>200,000 tons to be imported in the spring</p>
<p>According to a recent survey, due to poor rice yields in various regions this year, rice merchants are actively purchasing and importing foreign rice from Saigon and other places to regulate supply. Currently, the estimated total amount of goods that have arrived and have been ordered but not yet arrived in February, March, and April is over 200,000 tons. Shipping companies such as French postal ships, Java postal ships, Yamashita Steamship, and Dalian Steamship are all major customers, especially Yamashita Steamship, which transports the most, totaling about 70,000 to 80,000 tons. Dalian Steamship transported 2,500 tons of indica rice from Saigon to Shanghai in February on the Dongyang Maru and 3,600 tons on the Tianshan Maru. Since then, all postal ships have been importing large quantities of foreign rice. If the domestic rice yield is not severely deficient, the demand will not be lacking, and the rice price will not increase again.</p>

<h3>Dai Jitao and Zhu Jiahua Arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong Today</h3>
<p>Arriving by Japanese Ship at 1 PM</p>
<p>Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, and Zhu Jiahua, Director of the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department, were previously reported to be arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the President Cleveland. However, due to other important business, they stayed in Hong Kong. Yesterday, it was rumored that they had already passed through Shanghai and returned to Beijing to attend the Third Plenum of the Central Executive Committee. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper inquired at Dai's residence in Shanghai and was told that Dai had indeed not arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, nor had any telegram been received. According to other sources, Dai and Zhu changed to a certain Japanese ship to come to Shanghai, and are currently still en route. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai at about 1 PM today.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Shanghai Special Municipality Mayor Zhang Yuejun left Fujian on the 28th of last month, and traveled to Shanghai on the Pu'an warship. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Wusong last night. According to the Municipal Government, the ship Zhang was on encountered fog on the Ningbo sea, causing a slight delay. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning (the 3rd).</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi to go to Beijing Tonight</h3>
<p>Attending the Third Plenum</p>
<p>Going to Belgium on April 5th</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, is scheduled to take the night train to Beijing at 11 PM tonight to attend the Third Plenum of the Central Executive Committee. A reporter from this newspaper interviewed him at his residence yesterday. He said, "I am scheduled to sail to Belgium on April 5th. The first batch of our country's exhibits, totaling over 200 pieces, has been shipped out. The second batch will be shipped soon. I will stay in Belgium for about four or five months, and then go to Switzerland to attend the International Sports Conference, and then travel to the United States. I will return to China in about a year."</p>
<h3>Revised Timetable for Tianjin-Pukou Passenger Trains</h3>
<p>Due to the obstruction of the tracks between the Lianzhen Station and the north of Dezhou Station, the Traffic Department of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau has temporarily extended all passenger trains to Jinan starting from the previous day. Starting yesterday, the running dates of the trains have been officially revised. All trains running between Pukou and Jinan will only run to Jinan Prefecture starting tomorrow (the 3rd). Trains from Pukou to Jinan will depart from Pukou every Monday and Friday, and return from Jinan to Pukou on Wednesdays and Sundays.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association Asks for Caution in Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Agreement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association sent a telegram to the National Government and relevant ministries regarding the Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Agreement, stating that the report on the content of the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement, with raw materials and finished products as the scope of reciprocity, would be very detrimental to our country if true. Japanese goods imported into China are mostly finished products, while Chinese goods transported to Japan are mostly raw materials. The Japanese have traditionally used heavy taxes to reject our finished products and light taxes to welcome our raw materials. For example, silk goods: our country exports raw silk to Japan, while Japan exports finished silk fabrics to China. If we lightly tax our raw silk and their silk fabrics on a reciprocal basis, then Japanese silk fabrics imported into China will also be lightly taxed, and are bound to sell well in our country, while Chinese silk fabrics exported to Japan and Korea will still be subject to heavy taxes. Chinese goods will inevitably be more harmed than before. This is tantamount to striking down our country's industry and protecting their country's industry. In the future, Japanese silk fabrics will flood the market, and the sales of national silk fabrics will inevitably be completely deprived. Therefore, at this critical juncture of life and death, we earnestly request your attention and not to sign the agreement, so as to avoid making a big mistake and causing endless harm. We also ask that the full text of the agreement be disclosed in advance for the study of the business community, so that we can submit our opinions. We are eagerly awaiting orders.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Baling Maru Runs Aground</h3>
<p>All Passengers Rescued</p>
<p>The Baling Maru, a regular passenger ship of the Japanese Qing Steamship Company on the Guangdong-Shanghai-Tianjin route, ran aground in the Donghai sea off Shantou on the 28th of last month due to heavy fog. The ship took on water and the cargo was completely lost. The detailed situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Location of grounding: The Baling Maru (2,000+ tons) departed from Shanghai for Guangdong on February 19th. Due to encountering fog three times en route, it only reached the sea off Nanao Island east of Shantou at 9 AM on the 28th. At that time, the fog was very heavy and visibility was poor. The Baling Maru mistakenly went off course in the heavy fog and struck a submerged reef off Nanao Island. The bow cabin was struck by the reef, the bottom of the ship was breached, and seawater poured into the ship.</p>
<p>Damage to the ship's cabins: There were many passengers on board. After the bow cabin was first breached, the ship became heavy in the bow and high in the stern, making the situation very dangerous. As a result, the ship lost its stability in the sea and was in danger of capsizing. The captain was greatly alarmed and, in order to ensure the safety of all lives on board, ordered the engineer to open the throttle and crash the ship into the reef again. The second cabin was also breached. After water entered the first and second cabins, the ship leveled out slightly, and the crisis was slightly reduced.</p>
<p>Pirates attempt to rob: The area near Nanao Island, Shantou, is a frequent haunt of pirates, and there have often been robberies of merchant ships. After the Baling Maru had an accident, several pirate ships were reportedly planning to rob it. The captain of the Baling Maru urgently sent out a distress signal. The Japanese destroyer Kaki, stationed in Shantou, was the first to receive the signal and immediately sped to Nanao to protect the ship and prevent pirates from robbing it.</p>
<p>Rescue of passengers: The passengers on board the Baling Maru were panicked after the ship struck the reef. They gathered on the deck, some crying, some trying to board the lifeboats to escape, and some grabbing lifebuoys. Fortunately, the South China passenger ship Lushan Maru of the same company received a radio message relayed by a Japanese warship and sailed to Nanao Island. It immediately launched small sampans and rescued all the passengers from the Baling Maru onto its own ship yesterday morning, so there were no casualties.</p>
<p>Relief efforts by the head office: The Shanghai head office received a radio message relayed by the Japanese warship. The president of the company ordered the chief shipmaster stationed in Shanghai, Mr. Takeshita, to go to Shantou to Nanao yesterday with a large number of workers, water pumps, wooden barrels, cement, and other equipment needed to rescue the ship. He took a British ship to inspect and prepare for rescue. Yesterday, the Shanghai office also sent a special telegram to the Songshan Maru, which was coming to Shanghai from Guangdong, ordering it to quickly go to Nanao Island to tow and rescue the ship.</p>
<p>Loss of cargo: The Baling Maru was fully loaded with export goods from Shanghai to Guangdong, including raw peanuts, gypsum, and raw cakes. The cargo destined for Xiamen was only 100 bags of flour, which had already been unloaded. The remaining goods were all inside the ship. Now that the first and second cabins have been completely flooded, all the goods are completely submerged in water. The goods are all loaded by Chinese merchants, and the amount of loss is enormous.</p>
<h3>Sanbei Company to Tow Feihu Ship</h3>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Feihu ship was hit by the Jiangzhen warship of the Second Fleet of the Navy in the heart of the Yangtze River in Hankou. The stern of the ship was broken that night and sank immediately. Yesterday, the company continued to receive a telegram from Hankou stating that the bow of the ship, which was exposed above the water, had also sunk. The stern of the ship in the river had been slightly moved to the riverbank by the port authority. Yesterday, the Shanghai headquarters, in order to salvage the ship, ordered the chief shipmaster, Mr. Powers, to personally inspect Hankou. If it can be towed, he will send a telegram to Shanghai from Hankou, and then send workers, technicians, and water pumps to tow it. The Shanghai office is now waiting for the chief shipmaster's reply and will decide on a towing plan. The ship has 100,000 taels of silver in marine insurance.</p>
<p>Since the Feihu accident occurred, the insurance companies in this port have sent letters to the shipping companies, roughly stating that the insurance companies bear water insurance for each of the merchant ships. Should the ships be chartered for civilian transport, the original ordinary insurance would be still valid. However, if said ship is now being chartered for the transport of military personnel, and had not been insured to include a clause to cover the impounding of such ships, the original insurance policy would have immediately expired, and it would invariably give rise to complications if any accident had occurred. The letter directs current military transport vessels to insure for impounding of such ships.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau Case</h3>
<p>Postal Workers Union Petitions to Withdraw Order</p>
<p>Postal Administration Asks Municipal Party Department to Correct</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers Union has already expressed its opposition to the establishment of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau. The postal authorities have repeatedly explained the benefits of establishing a special bureau to the union representatives. After the union petitioned the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the order, the Ministry of Communications sent a strict telegram to the postal administration, severely instructing it that the union should not interfere in administration. In addition to complying with the order, the postal authorities also sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, stating that people's organizations are under the guidance of the Party Department, requesting the Shanghai Municipal Party Department to correct. The original letter to the Party Department is as follows: "Respectfully, we received the Ministry of Communications' Order No. 285, which states that the Ministry has established the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau and has drafted the articles of association, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for approval and promulgation. The original submission and articles of association are copied and ordered to be investigated and informed to all affiliated organizations. We continued to receive the Ministry of Communications' Order No. 289, which states that the Ministry has established the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, which is about to open. The bureau needs postal personnel, and they are allowed to retain their original assets. All treatment will still be handled in accordance with the postal regulations. The order is to be investigated and informed to all affiliated organizations. We have successively ordered the various district bureaus to forward the order to their respective subordinates for their joint information. We have now received a respectful telegram from the Ministry of Communications, stating that the Shanghai Postal Workers Union has submitted a petition to the National Government for reconsideration and withdrawal of the order regarding the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau. The government's establishment of the Savings and Remittances Bureau is originally a national construction project. The union is ignorant of the facts and repeatedly interferes in national administration beyond its authority, which is extremely absurd. The acting Director-General is responsible for strictly supervising and guiding the union, and strictly rebutting it. If there is any further deviation from the track, it will be severely punished. Please follow the order. We have investigated that our country has followed the regulations of various countries and established the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau to plan and promote the expansion of savings and remittances, so that postal achievements can be further improved, and cooperation can be carried out to jointly seek the development of construction undertakings, which is beneficial and harmless to the country and the people. The Shanghai Postal Workers Union has failed to understand this. Our bureau has repeatedly provided sincere guidance, and the Ministry of Communications has also severely rebuked it.

<h3>Results of Silk Merchants' Petition</h3>
<p>Minister Sympathizes with Merchants' Situation</p>
<p>Representatives Vigorously Assume Responsibility</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in order to maintain a fair attitude between both parties in the raw silk trade and to improve raw silk production methods, so that foreign trade can develop further, specifically ordered the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to establish a raw silk inspection office in April of last year. Bureau Chief Zou then requested that silk industry leaders Huang Jinchen, Shen Huachen, Cheng Bingruo, Wu Shenbo, Chen Haoquan, Li Youren, silk industry experts Miao Zhongxiu, Zhou Junmei, etc., be appointed as members of the preparatory committee to organize the committee and engage in preparations. Regarding the drafting of detailed inspection rules, more than ten meetings were held, and after ten months of long-term consideration, it was determined that the public weighing system was the fairest for buying and selling. Japan, the country that produces the most silk today, has implemented this system for two years, with great results. Our country should urgently imitate this system when inspecting raw silk. Therefore, it was decided to adopt this system. After the Ministry announced it, it was originally scheduled to be implemented on February 1 of this year. However, although the inspection bureau's public weighing inspection had already been announced, all the procedures between buyers and sellers required considerable reform and could not be completed in time. A special request was submitted to the Ministry and Bureau to postpone the implementation by two months. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce approved a one-month postponement. However, some silk merchants had not studied the public weighing system on a daily basis and had many doubts. It still takes time to guide them, and the leaders felt deeply that this was difficult. Therefore, they went to the bureau on the previous two days to state everything and planned to go to the Ministry to petition for another postponement. Bureau Chief Zou stated that the detailed raw silk inspection rules had already been announced and had been postponed once. Now that it was March 1, it would be extremely difficult to request another postponement. Therefore, he went to the Ministry with the representatives Huang Jinchen, Shen Huachen, Zhu Jingan, Huang Jinfan, etc., to request instructions. Minister Mu and Vice Minister, etc., stated that the detailed raw silk inspection rules would be difficult to postpone again after March 1 and did not approve the request. However, they were very understanding of the difficult situation of the leaders among the industry, and the leaders had repeatedly stated that they would definitely be able to comply with the regulations by April 1. Therefore, it was agreed that before April 1, raw silk for export would be allowed to be issued with an exemption from inspection and public weighing certificate, so that silk merchants could prepare everything. The result was still satisfactory. In addition, the inspection fee for the main quality inspection in the detailed rules has been greatly reduced, only one-quarter of the old rules before March 1.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Inspection Institute Preparing to Inspect Silkworm Eggs</h3>
<p>Established Inspection Department by Order of the Ministry</p>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Mining considers silkworm diseases, such as microsporidiosis, flacherie, grasserie, and muscardine, to be a major threat to the silk industry. It has previously formulated and announced the Regulations for the Control of Silkworm Egg Production and the Provisional Measures for Inspection and Improvement of Silkworm Eggs. Now, with the silkworm hatching season approaching, the Ministry has specifically ordered the Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Institute to establish a silkworm egg inspection department and has appointed personnel to oversee its operations. The text of the order is recorded below for your information:</p>
<p>It is hereby ordered that the inspection of silkworm eggs is crucial for improving the silk industry. In accordance with Article 1 of the Provisional Measures for Inspection and Improvement of Silkworm Eggs, a silkworm egg inspection department should be established within the Institute to handle matters related to silkworm egg inspection. He Shangping is hereby appointed as the Director of the Silkworm Egg Inspection Department, and Chang Zonghui as the Deputy Director. Before He Shangping arrives, Ge Jingzhong is appointed to act as Director in his absence. In addition to this appointment, you are hereby notified.</p>
<p>The Institute has now sent letters to both Directors Ge and Chang, instructing them to report to the Institute as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the Silkworm Egg Inspection Department has been established and is actively preparing everything. It is reported that inspections will begin soon.</p>
<h3>Four Silk Industry Guilds Discussing Soil Silk Export Inspection</h3>
<p>Joint Meeting Convened Last Night</p>
<p>The silk industry guilds of Guandong, Shandong, Sichuan, and Hubei convened a joint meeting last night at 6:00 PM at the Central Vegetable Society to discuss the inspection of raw silk exports. Those in attendance included Ling Zhifang, Liu Shanfu, Cai Zhimu, Cai Renbao, Lu Zisheng, Zheng Yushu, Zhong Xusheng, Tan Zhensheng, Lu Lisheng, and over 130 reporters from various newspapers. Cai Zhimu was elected as chairman, but due to fatigue, he requested Ling Zhifang to represent him. Cai Renbao then reported on the previous situation, followed by Liu Shanfu, who reported on his communications with Zou Bingwen, the director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, regarding the private capacity of Mr. A. Edgar. He also reported on his communications with the foreign merchants' export guild, which yielded no results.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Zheng Yushu, Lu Zisheng, Cai Renbao, and others expressed their opinions, all agreeing that public measurement was difficult to implement for yellow, white, gray, and soil silk.

<p>Representatives were elected: Cai Renbao and Tan Zhensheng (from Guandong/Shandong), Ling Zhifang and Zheng Yushu (from Sichuan), and Lu Lisheng and Liu Shanfu (from Hubei).

<h3>What I Heard Before the Municipal Council Board of Directors Re-election</h3>
<p>Continuing Log of Political Views of Candidates for Board of Directors Continued Shanghai Times publishes political views of candidates for Municipal Council Board of Directors, Saito, the newly-promoted Japanese candidate, said that he should first strive to maintain law and order in the concession, protect all public interests, and international welfare, and if elected, he will do his best to cooperate with the directors to promote the welfare of foreign residents, seek the prosperity of business and protect all interests. Fukushima, the old Japanese director, said that his purpose has always been to do his best to serve the citizens, and in the future, he will continue to seek the coordination of various countries to increase the welfare of the citizens and seek the prosperity of Shanghai. He deeply believes that the existence of the concession is beneficial, and any plan to change the concession should not be rashly implemented unless the interests of the Chinese and foreign people involved are most carefully considered. Sheppard, the old British director, said that the first thing to do in the concession is to eliminate bandits. If the financial resources are insufficient, the cost of school equipment and comfortable living can be sacrificed to engage in this. Secondly, widen the roads to facilitate transportation. He believes that the best way to solve the east-west traffic problem is to fill in the lower reaches of the Suzhou River and dredge a new river in a straight line from the Mackenzie Road railway freight yard to Zhoujiazui.</p>
<p>News reporters listen to questions. The China Press once asked the candidates for their opinions on allowing news reporters to listen to the Municipal Council Board of Directors meetings. As a result, six people, including British Pei Er, Lei Sili, Hughes, Mike Knadeng, and American Boiden Carney, generally expressed their approval. Saito, a Japanese national, did not advocate that news reporters listen, but advocated expanding the scope of publication so that the president or general manager could announce to the news reporters after the meeting. Marseille, a British national, completely opposed it.</p>
<p>The preliminary election results of the American Overseas Chinese People's Daily said that the American Overseas Chinese Congress was held in the Citibank Club last night to explore the opinions of overseas Chinese on the three American candidates for the Board of Directors in order to select the two most popular people to be elected as directors of the Municipal Council on the two official voting days on Monday and Tuesday. There were many people present at the time. In addition to more than 100 businessmen, there were also dozens of women, but opinions on this method varied. After a long debate, Basad proposed that if the three candidates were willing to be bound by the resolution of the Association, they might as well vote to determine who is most popular. Then only Borden and Carney of the three candidates held this attitude. As a result, the people in the association voted to support the two who were willing to be bound by the resolution of the Association, and listened to the third candidate, Dirk, to run independently. However, according to Dirk's expression this morning (the 1st), he believed that the trial vote in the American Overseas Chinese Congress last night failed to express the public opinion of the citizens on his candidacy, so he did not want to withdraw and would continue to run. There are still news reports from this city transferred to the back page.</p>

<h3>Machine Room of North Railway Station of Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Robbed</h3>
<p>More than 5,900 Yuan Salary Stolen</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM yesterday, three bandits broke into the machine room of the Shanghai North Railway Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway while salaries were being distributed, and stole more than 5,900 yuan in cash. The beginning and end of the incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>It is customary for all employees and drivers in the machine room of the Shanghai North Railway Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to have the salary officer of the room lead people to the accounting office of the North Railway Station on the first day of each month to receive salary and distribute it in the room. Yesterday was the date for paying the February salary. As usual, Liu Binghe, the clerk of the room, led people to the North Railway Station to receive it, and immediately walked back along the railway track from the North Railway Station. When he was about to reach the machine room, the officer suddenly felt that someone was secretly following him behind him, so he turned back and asked where he was going. The bandit claimed to be visiting a friend in the machine room, and when asked the name of his friend, he falsely claimed that he wanted to visit a stoker named Hammer. The officer immediately replied that there was no such person in the machine room, and the bandit left. Unexpectedly, after the officer entered the No. 6 machine room, while arranging to distribute salaries by name, he suddenly saw the bandit he had met earlier with two other bandits, all wearing blue cloth shirts and pants and holding pistols, broke into the room, and immediately declared that no one was allowed to speak out. At the same time, they stole all the salaries placed on the table, totaling more than 5,900 yuan in cash, and fired two shots into the sky and fled. Although there were many people in the machine room at the time, they were helpless because the location was in the wilderness and there were no precautions, so they could not resist. After the incident, they immediately telegraphed the garrison and railway police at the North Railway Station to pursue the bandits, but the bandits had already fled far away. Only a few suspects were found in the shacks where the Jiangbei workers lived near the machine room. They were immediately sent to the headquarters, and detectives were sent to investigate and round up.</p>
<h3>Bitter Enemy Kills Wang Baoshan After Kicking Open His Door</h3>
<p>Rising from Picking Dung and Jealousy of His Peers</p>
<p>Enemy Enters the Room Without Saying a Word</p>
<p>Gunshots Bang Bang Instantly Killed</p>
<p>Wife Bravely Saved Ineffectively</p>
<p>Wang Baoshan, a native of Funing, lived at No. 13, Lane 72, Xiangyanqiao Road, Outer Hongkou. He opened the Central Printing House at the entrance of the lane to undertake small printing jobs. In addition, he also operated a dung-picking business on the road. At about 9:00 PM the night before last, Wang and his wife, Shi, were at home when two enemies went to Wang's house and assassinated him. It is said that the reason for the incident was the competition for the dung-picking business. In addition to detaining the murderer's wife, relatives, and suspects, the 3rd Section of the 5th District Public Security Bureau is now strictly investigating and arresting the murderers in order to solve the case as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Kicking Open the Door At about 9:00 PM the night before last, Wang Baoshan was alone in the doorway, gazing leisurely. Dai Ruzhao, a fellow villager who he knew well, passed by the doorway. Seeing Wang standing leisurely, he stepped forward to exchange greetings. At that time, Wang's wife, Shi, was in the room. She only heard the two exchange a few words before Dai said goodbye and left. Wang Baoshan also walked into the door, closing the front door in preparation for resting. Who knew that at this time, Liu Daguanzi, an acquaintance, kicked open the door without asking the reason. Seeing this, Wang Baoshan was about to greet him to ask why he broke in, but it was too late. The visitor took out a pistol from his sleeve and opened fire on Wang. His wife, Shi, was beside him, speechless.</p>
<p>Screaming It's Not Good Liu Daguanzi at the front door did not exchange words with Wang. After taking out the gun, he aimed at Wang Baoshan and opened fire, firing a total of four shots. Seeing the person shooting her husband, Shi jumped up and disregarded her own safety, stepped forward and hugged Liu, intending to drag him out. Just as they were wrestling, Dai Ruzhao suddenly broke in a second time. Seeing Dai, Wang Baoshan screamed that it was not good. Then Liu Daguanzi continued to fire, hitting Wang's legs. Wang was shocked and hid under the table, and Dai Ruzhao fired under the table, all hitting Wang's vital parts. So he died, and he was killed instantly.</p>
<p>Just Want One Life Seeing that the purpose of the assassination had been achieved, the two murderers fled out the door. After his wife Shi was heartbroken, desperately dragged Dai back to the house and cried for help. However, because he was weak and not an opponent, he was still broken free and escaped. During the dispute, he said in his mouth, "Just want one life, don't want two lives." Liu Daguanzi also took the opportunity to escape without a trace. Shi then ran to the door and shouted for help. The nearby police officer heard the news and immediately rushed to report to the 3rd Section of the 5th District Public Security Bureau. Director Zhang immediately ordered armed policemen to go to the scene of the incident to arrest him. However, the murderer had gone like a yellow crane, and only the murderer's relatives were taken to the office.</p>
<p>It's Pitiable The deceased was in his thirties. His body was inspected by the local court yesterday. A total of eight shots were fired at the time, and most of them were hit. The wife of the murderer Dai Ruzhao, Dai Deng, the younger brother Dai Runeng, the wife of the accomplice Wang Fuguan, Wang Zhu, the younger brother of Wang Wang Wenxiang, the suspect Shi Fulin, and his wife Shi Wang, the witness Shi Zonglin, etc., have been detained and sent to the bureau for questioning. The wife of the deceased, Wang Shi, and his younger brother Wang Tingzhang, both went to the 3rd Section of the 5th District to report the incident after the incident. At that time, there was lightning and heavy rain, and Shi fainted several times. It was pitiable.</p>

<h3>Tax Collectors Overcharging Grain</h3>
<p>Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment with Two Years Probation</p>
<p>Gu Yongshang, a tax collector from Jiangwan Township, Shanghai County, Wu Songren, overcharged Chen Yaozong, a Yue native residing at No. 1111, Broadway Road, 83 yuan and 7 jiao, when he was ordered to collect busy grain in September last year. Chen did not doubt this because the amount he paid was the same as the amount on the grain certificate. A few days ago, Gu again overcharged 33 yuan and 8 jiao, 5 fen for collecting this year's grain, and Chen still did not suspect any fraud. However, he felt that the grain he paid seemed to be very large. After being calculated by others, he learned that he had been overcharged, so he negotiated and twisted Gu to the Hongkou Police Station. He ordered Detective Feng Qi to take Gu to Jiangwan to inquire about the person who filled out the grain certificate. Gu then returned 40 yuan. The police station believed that Gu, as a civil servant, should not have done this and should be taken into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the provisional court for investigation. First, Detective Feng presented the grain certificate and 40 yuan of banknotes that Gu had handed over to the case and reported the investigation. He said that Gu's method of overcharging was to alter the amount on the grain certificate. For example, if the amount on the grain certificate was 7 yuan and 5 jiao, he would add the word "thirty" on top of it, and then charge the taxpayer 37 yuan and 5 jiao. It is not difficult to check the handwriting in the grain certificate, and it will be clear. Gu confessed that he collected the money according to the amount on the grain certificate, and the person who filled out the grain certificate made a mistake, so he returned the overcharged money after calculating it. However, the plaintiff did not accept it, which was not intentional fraud. He now has an old mother at home and requests forgiveness. Judge Wang verified the confession that there was sufficient evidence of Gu Yongshang's fraud. According to the law, he should be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than seven years. Taking into account that he was a first offender and that the plaintiff requested no reduction, he was sentenced to one year of imprisonment with two years of probation. The 40 yuan in banknotes was returned to the plaintiff to be taken away, and the grain certificate was attached to the file.</p>
<h3>Major Theft Case at Guangfeng Medicinal Materials Shop</h3>
<p>Committed by a Former Shop Assistant</p>
<p>The Guangfeng Medicinal Materials Shop in Dou Tan Lane, Li Xian Gua Street, 16th Pu, Nanshi, has been open for many years, so its business is quite developed. The shop has three entrances. The front two entrances are used by the shop to set up a business department and dormitories for various partners. The upstairs in the back entrance is used as a warehouse for storing various official medicinal materials. Every day until 5:00 PM, when the shop closes, the warehouse officer goes to lock the iron door and wooden fence of the warehouse as usual. Unexpectedly, at about 7:00 AM the day before, when the warehouse officer opened the warehouse door as usual, he found that the wooden fence had been pried open and the iron door had also been opened. He realized that something had happened and was extremely frightened. He immediately reported to the managers and others and went inside to inspect. The large and small antelope horns and black antelope horns stored inside, totaling 44 pieces, a package of pearls, weighing 3 taels and 9 qian, and a Pu color of Sichuan fritillary, worth about 7,800 yuan, had been stolen. Afterwards, he reported to the 1st District Headquarters and requested to pursue the case. Until yesterday, the squad leader of the district, Dong Mingde, detectives Yuan Haishan, Lü Anpu, Zhang Guilin, Cai Zhiqing, etc., learned that this case was committed by Yuan Ruibao, a former shop assistant of the shop, who was hiding in Room 23 of the Siming Hotel, Xiaodongmen. They immediately went to arrest him and recovered the original booty. Chen, the district chief, took the case for a preliminary hearing. Yuan confessed that he was 34 years old, a native of Ningbo, and had been a warehouse officer in the Guangfeng Medicinal Materials Shop for two years. He suddenly quit at the beginning of this year. At about 5:00 PM on the 27th of last month, I took advantage of the crowd to sneak into the shop and lurked in the firewood room in the back entrance. At about 1:00 AM the next morning, when everyone in the shop was asleep, I went upstairs, pried off the wooden fence with a kitchen knife, and then used a copper needle to pry open the lock to enter. After stealing the goods, I wrapped them in cloth and threw them out of the window along the street. Then I hung down on the telephone pole in front of the window, took the stolen goods, and entered the hotel, etc. Because the case involved a major theft, the district chief ordered that the people and the stolen goods be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Yuxing Lane Landlord Owes Fees and Water Cutoff Lawsuit Reconciled</h3>
<p>Because the owner of Yuxing Lane, Hongxing Road, Zhabei, owed water bills, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company stopped supplying water in accordance with the regulations. The owner filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court requesting to maintain water supply. The Municipal Public Works Bureau reported the case and submitted it to the Municipal Council Meeting, which resolved three measures: (1) Order Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to immediately restore water supply; (2) The Public Security Bureau will retain the rent pending resolution by the court; (3) Send a letter to the court requesting a speedy judgment. After two court hearings, they were ordered to reconcile out of court. It is now learned that the plaintiff, the owner, is willing to pay the defendant company the water bill from July 1918 in accordance with the new regulations for installing water meters. The defendant is also willing to install a separate meter in the homes of each tenant in Yuxing Lane on behalf of the plaintiff within one month, so that the plaintiff can check the amount of water used by each tenant. The two parties reached a compromise, and the court announced that the case had been settled.</p>

<h3>Municipal Report of the Shanghai Special Municipality</h3>
<p>(Year 18 of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality has been established for two and a half years. Its responsibilities are significant and weighty. The work it should prioritize is the completion of construction projects during the period of political tutelage, the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan for a Greater Shanghai, gradual progress, and adaptation to the times. At the beginning of this construction,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>the scale is roughly in place, but the lack of visible results and the absence of immediate achievements are felt. Constrained by the times and limited financial resources, the extent of progress is indeed very limited, and the grand vision of construction is just beginning. Fortunately, with the supervision and guidance of the government, the Party, and the citizens, deficiencies have been corrected, allowing the fulfillment of duties and careful management. A summary of the work done in the past year is reported as follows. The second collection of compilations of laws and regulations in the government gazette, as well as the work reports of various bureaus, are attached for reference. Your review is appreciated.</p>
<p>I. Regarding the construction of the city center area: In the past, the city's work has been largely concentrated on the reorganization of the old city area due to the needs of the times. However, the transformation of the old city area is costly and slow to produce results. In terms of the city's current population, the development of various industries, and the realization of the Greater Shanghai plan, it is necessary to determine the city's construction center area as soon as possible so that various industries can proceed in an orderly manner and develop to the fullest extent. The resolution of the fifth municipal representative congress's municipal report also included the proposal to select a more open and easily developed area, concentrate financial resources, and construct all undertakings to attract industry and commerce. In view of this, the government intends to apply the most modern principles and methods of urban design, based on the city's actual situation, to establish a far-reaching plan, delineating an area of approximately 7,000 acres north of Yinxing Road, south of Zha Yinxing Road, east of Songhu Road, and west of the tenth picture of Zhou Nan and the fifth picture of Yi, as the city center area, to ensure that the Shanghai Special Municipality occupies a sound position in the economic aspect in the future, with perfect ports, good transportation, and a solid industrial and commercial base. Other facilities, such as roads, ditches, water supply, and housing, will also be adapted to modern needs and facilitate future development, so that citizens living in them can feel physically and mentally at ease and happily reside in this land. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be perfected without a comprehensive plan. Therefore, in July of the 18th year, the City Center Construction Committee was established to focus on design matters, and in September of the same year, municipal experts attending the Tokyo World Engineering Conference were invited to China for consultation and careful selection. The planning outline of the city center area has been drafted by the City Center Area Construction Committee (the plan is complete) to serve as the basis for phased implementation.</p>
<p>II. Regarding the improvement of transportation matters: As mentioned above, city center design is closely related to the improvement of water and land transportation throughout the city. The resolution of the fifth municipal representative congress's municipal report also included the proposal that, in order to achieve the unification of municipal administration in the future, the convenience of transportation must first be sought. The municipal government should separately formulate trunk and branch road plans and implement them in stages to ensure that broad roads are spread throughout the territory. In view of this, the government has a transportation development plan for the city, the outline of which is as follows: (1) Regarding land transportation, the first priority is to build city-wide trunk roads. Since the city center area has been determined, the central position of the city has been fixed, and transportation from all directions should be concentrated here. Therefore, it is proposed to build an east-west trunk road through the intersection of Zha Yinxing Road and Songhu Road, passing west through Zhongshan North Road (to the planned main station) and east to Pudong. Furthermore, a north-south trunk road should be built perpendicular to the east-west trunk road through the center of the city center area, passing north through the Yinxing Town Water and Electricity Plant to Pudong, and intersecting the extension line of Songhu Road in the south. In addition, the planning of each trunk road should ensure convenient transportation between towns, stations, and regions. Existing roads with suitable locations should be utilized, and those that are discontinuous should be connected. In total, the length of the city's trunk roads is approximately 400 kilometers. Due to limited financial resources, they cannot all be built at the same time, so they must be carried out in stages according to priority. The five lines proposed to be built in the first phase are: (A) Zhongshan North Road, (B) the east-west trunk road in the city center area, (C) the trunk road from the city center to Zhabei, (D) the extension of Songhu Road, and (E) a section of the road along the ditch in Pudong. Construction has now begun on a selective basis. In the 18th year, the roads built by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works totaled 18,882 meters in length, covering an area of 280,864 square meters, 741,218 square meters of roads were repaired, 14,313 meters of ditches were built, and 11 bridges were built. The main projects included the merger of Jishui and Fangbang Roads and the completion of the entire roadbed of Zhongshan South Road. The road lines proposed for the second to fifth phases have also been separately determined and are shown in the city-wide trunk road map and description (attached map and description). If progress can be made in an orderly manner, the planned goals should be fully achieved within five years. (2) Regarding water transportation, the first priority is to dredge rivers. The city has a vast territory, and the largest trunk rivers are the Wusong River and the Pu Zhao River. Siltation is everywhere, water conservancy is neglected, and farmland is impoverished. The Municipal Port Authority has conducted surveys and designs to begin dredging as soon as possible. In addition, rivers closely related to shipping, farmland, drinking water, and people, and in urgent need of dredging, such as the north bank of the Wusong River in Zhabei District, Zhangjia Weir in Yangjing District, the Di Jinggang and Shenjinggang in Pengpu District, and the Jiebankou in Gaoqiao District, have also been surveyed, designed, and dredged successively, totaling 36,731 cubic meters of earth excavated. As for other rivers to be dredged, there are 39 locations, requiring the excavation of 1,361,280 cubic meters of earth, costing approximately one million yuan. Work will begin as soon as financial resources are available. Other projects, such as the construction of the East Pond, West Pond, and Yi Zhou Pond, as well as the construction of the Huhan and Pudong wharves and the Old South Wharf, are all related to water transportation and have been completed by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and the Municipal Port Authority in sequence.</p>
<p>III. Regarding the reorganization of financial matters: Finance is the mother of undertakings. Since its establishment, the government has actively improved financial administration. In the 16th year, a summary of the general situation was reported to the conference. In the past 17th year, continuous efforts were made to reorganize and plan work. Regarding donations, such as increasing house donations, consolidating car donations and horse racing taxes, collecting entertainment donations, and canceling ship donation contractors and taking back self-management. Regarding accounting, such as convening meetings of accounting personnel, revising accounting regulations, establishing the principles of general accounting and special accounting, and implementing independent special accounting to meet the needs of developing designated undertakings. Regarding auditing, such as strictly implementing budgets to seek accuracy and strictly reviewing final accounts to prevent waste, as well as various other reforms, have all been promoted to the fullest extent to enrich the municipal treasury so that construction projects can be developed to the fullest extent. The above is the course of improving finances over the past year. As for the financial situation, the revenue in the 17th year was 4,275,564 yuan, 2 jiao, and 4 fen, an increase of approximately one-quarter compared to the revenue in the 16th year. The reasons for the increase are nothing more than reorganizing donations and taxes and enforcing financial unity. However, with the continuous expansion of the city's construction projects, expenditures have also become vast, totaling 4,396,776 yuan, 4 jiao, and 9 fen in the 17th year. The revenue and expenditure offset each other, resulting in a deficit of 121,212 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen. However, by the end of the year, the municipal treasury was owed more than 360,000 yuan in house donations, the Jiangsu Provincial Government owed more than 409,000 yuan in police subsidies, and the Ministry of Finance owed horse racing taxes. In total, more than 700,000 yuan was owed. The municipal treasury also owed more than 500,000 yuan in various administrative and temporary expenses. The revenue and expenditure offset each other, and although there was a surplus on the surface, the rest has not been received to this day, except for the house donation, which was postponed to the 18th year for collection. Therefore, the municipal treasury still owes more than 200,000 yuan, and various undertakings have been affected by the treasury's shortfall. The total revenue and expenditure in the 17th year have been described above. The aforementioned expenditures are now analyzed separately by nature as a percentage: the municipal government itself accounted for 6.4%, finance accounted for 5.2%, public security accounted for 22%, public works accounted for 18%, education accounted for 20.5%, health accounted for 4.2%, land accounted for 4.5%, society accounted for 3.8%, public utilities accounted for 6.5%, port affairs accounted for 0.7%, subsidies accounted for 5.3%, the urban area accounted for 0.6%, and other miscellaneous expenses accounted for 1.7%. Looking at the above items, the three items of public security, public works, and education have accounted for more than 61% of the total expenditure. This is because the city has convenient water and land transportation and a large population. Moreover, with the International Settlement spanning the area, bandits are rampant, and reactionary elements all use this as a refuge. Adequate police force is necessary to maintain public security, road construction is necessary to facilitate transportation, and the expansion of education is necessary to improve citizens' knowledge and cultivate school-age children. Therefore, the allocation of the above funds must be prioritized based on urgency, importance, and weight. However, due to limited financial resources, it has not been possible to make full progress. The budgeted revenue for the 18th year totals 5,054,707 yuan, 2 jiao, and 6 fen, and the total expenditure is 5,060,061 yuan and 6 jiao. The municipal government itself accounts for approximately 5.84%, finance accounts for approximately 5.28%, public security accounts for approximately 23.59%, public works accounts for approximately 13.94%, education accounts for approximately 19.77%, land accounts for approximately 4.67%, health accounts for approximately 4.7%, society accounts for approximately 3.92%, public utilities accounts for approximately 4.77%, port affairs accounts for approximately 1.22%, the urban area accounts for approximately 1.03%, subsidies account for approximately 6.07%, and other miscellaneous expenses account for approximately 5.2%. Since the budget was announced, due to the progress of operations, there have been successive additional expenditures, totaling approximately 191,015 yuan and 2 jiao. Since the year has not yet ended, the actual revenue and expenditure situation in the past first half of the year is presented in detail. The revenue was more than 2.8 million yuan, including more than 100,000 yuan in the payment of surplus funds from the 17th year by various subordinate units, an increase of more than 300,000 yuan compared to the budget, which was actually due to the reorganization of old donations and the collection of house donations. The expenditure was more than 2.5 million yuan, and the temporary expenses were approximately 300,000 yuan. Considering the overall expenditure, approximately 300,000 yuan was used to pay the arrears of administrative and temporary expenses from the 17th year. As for this year's budget, it has been implemented since September, and the old budget was still used for distribution in July and August in order to save expenses and make up for deficits. However, the overall situation is still insufficient because the expenditures under the temporary item of the current account, such as the repayment of bank overdrafts and the transfer of funds to various subordinate units, are very large. Therefore, the bank is still overdrawn by more than 220,000 yuan. In addition to the general inventory of 60,000 yuan, there is still a shortage of more than 160,000 yuan. Although the regular expenses have been paid in full, a large amount of approximately 180,000 yuan is still owed in temporary expenses. As for the situation in the second half of the year, the abolition of the Northern Expedition donation under the land tax item and the collection of house donation arrears will increase revenue. However, there is no further room for reduction in expenditures, and various construction projects also require a lot of money. The temporary expenses will also be considerable. The financial situation in the second half of the year is expected to be even more difficult than in the first half of the year. The actual financial situation of the city has been described above. In order to develop the future of Greater Shanghai, we must actively plan and open up sources of revenue. Therefore, in the 18th year, municipal bonds worth 3 million yuan were issued, of which 1.2 million yuan was earmarked for the construction of city-wide trunk roads, 500,000 yuan for the construction of the city center area, 210,000 yuan for the reorganization of old public debt, and 1 million yuan for the establishment of a municipal bank, so that construction projects can be realized on schedule. After the establishment of the municipal bank, it will be independent of the municipal treasury and implement payment orders, so that the three powers of revenue, expenditure, and auditing will be separated, and financial administration will be more thorough. The above is for temporary purposes. However, municipal construction is changing with each passing day, and regular income must be planned to provide financial support. However, at present, the people's livelihood is declining, and material resources are scarce. Arbitrary taxes and levies must be eliminated. It is not convenient to increase donations and taxes to increase the burden on citizens. The only solution at present is to clarify the municipal tax collection rights and recover the wharf donation. According to the central government's division of national and local taxes, the slaughter tax, brokerage tax, fishing tax, pig tax, and ship donation all belong to local tax revenue. Since the division of powers between provinces and cities, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has not been allowed to transfer them. After repeated consultations, it has not been agreed to do so. In order to increase municipal financial resources, they should be actively transferred to the municipal government for management. In addition, the distribution of Chinese and foreign wharf taxes is uneven. Negotiations are continuing in the hope of a quick resolution. If the above two items can be achieved, the city can increase its annual revenue by approximately one million yuan. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Laughing It Off</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Father (suddenly entering the room)—— .</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Son——I am telling a story to Miss Wang.</p>
<p>Father——Why are your heads together, shoulder to shoulder, so close? And why is your hand around her waist?</p>
<p>Son——Because I am telling a love story.</p>
<p>A——You are a staunch bachelor.</p>

<h3>Too Many Universities</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Tu asked: "Universities are where talent is cultivated. In ancient times, it was said that great achievements were made in nine years. Now, it is specialized graduation. China speaks of construction every day, and is suffering from a lack of talent. So why worry about too many universities? Now the slogan is 'three mores': more soldiers, more bandits, and more universities. Shouldn't there be more universities?"</p>
<p>Meng Bozi said: "That is not what I mean. What I dislike about universities is that there are too many sloppy ones, too many incompetent ones, and too many fake ones."</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Tu said: "This is truly not clear until you say it, and the more you say it, the more confused I become. I am asking about the quantity of universities, but you are talking about the quality of universities. If the quality is not good, then improve it. Fake ones can be changed to not be fake. The same goes for sloppy and incompetent ones. Why take your anger out on the quantity and lump universities in with soldiers and bandits, and call them 'too many universities'? For everything, you must find a solution. If there are too many soldiers, then reorganize them. Aren't you going to reorganize the universities? If there are too many bandits, then suppress them. Aren't you going to suppress the universities?"</p>
<p>Meng Bozi said: "That is not what I mean. Anything is valued when it is rare. When there are too many, it is like yellow reeds and white flowers, all the same and indistinguishable. They cannot be valued, but can only be cheapened. Let me use the medals from the early years of the Republic as an example. The Jiahe Medal, when first created, was a great honor for rewarding meritorious service. How respected it was! But then batches of dozens, then batches of hundreds were given out. At the time, they were called 'Medal Rain.' People hated that there were too many. So they had to save the situation by making it special and different. They then created a special Baoguang Jiahe Medal and limited and regulated it, and distinguished it by levels. They also created a Baoguang Medal with a large sash. If you use medals as an analogy to universities, you will have thought half the problem through."</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Tu said: "Your argument still does not resolve my confusion. In the past, there was Medal Rain, now there is just University Rain. Save the situation, make it special and different, and create a Baoguang University. Limit it, distinguish it, and create a Baoguang Large Sash University. A university is a place of great learning. It is better to have something than nothing, and better to have more than to have less. The more universities there are, the more talent there will be. The more talent there is, the more construction there will be. I wish that there were more universities than soldiers and bandits. Why do you hate having too many universities?"</p>
<p>Meng Bozi angrily did not reply. Free Old Man said: "Meng Bo's point of view is very clear. Hu Tu's words may not be so confused. Gentlemen, are they many or not? Why must you argue about whether there are many? There are things for which many is valued. Why not argue for many? We are all laymen. Don't say too much. Too much talk leads to failure. Please record this Q&amp;A and introduce it to Free Talk to question education experts. What do you think?"</p>
<h3>Difficult to Find a Location for Foch Statue</h3>
<p>— Willow Branch</p>
<p>Speaking of the French General Foch, everyone cannot help but feel admiration. He was the authority in the European War, the soul of the Allied forces. Indeed, this was a war in which the democracy of the twentieth century attacked monarchical autocracy. Victory of course belonged to the former. However, if it were not for the genius and perseverance of General Foch, then the traditional flame of Hochst and Châlons might not have been extinguished in 1918. Therefore, the people of Paris had long wanted to erect a statue for him, partly to express their enthusiasm for worshipping heroes, and partly to leave a place of commemoration for future generations. Therefore, the former Prime Minister Poincaré specially organized a committee to consider the progress of this matter. However, the question of the location of the statue sparked a dispute. Initially, the committee circled the center of the Champs-Élysées because this is the most bustling area of Paris, where people gather, and it is easy to admire. Moreover, the Victory Memorial and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier are also there. The general's equestrian statue, added to it, would be a triumvirate, making it even more interesting to complement each other. Unexpectedly, public opinion unanimously opposed this plan. It is said that the beauty of the Champs-Élysées lies entirely in its distant view, which is enhanced by its setting. If the general's tall statue were erected in the middle, the beauty of this avenue would inevitably be diminished. One reporter even joked, "If we really want to erect General Foch's equestrian statue in uniform in the middle of this bustling city, then it would be simply like a cop, watching there all day long, directing the vehicles coming and going." However, apart from that, in all of vast Paris, they could not find a suitable place to place the statue of this great hero. One place was rejected because there were too many trees, and another was rejected because it was too far from the city. As a result, it became an intractable problem. The statue of this majestic General Foch is temporarily unable to be seen by the world.</p>
<h3>Strange Thief on the Road to Southern Anhui</h3>
<p>— Chunhua</p>
<p>Before the sale of my family's land, the old tenant farmer surnamed Zou would definitely come to my house once a year. In addition to settling accounts, he would often present us with local specialties. We loved him deeply as children. As we grew older, the land changed hands, and Zou also became increasingly old. He stayed in the countryside and rarely went out. The task of settling grain payments was entirely handled by his son. And his son never came to our house. Yesterday, old Zou suddenly came, tottering, and his talkativeness was as it used to be. He expressed deep regret for the decline of my family's fortunes and encouraged us to quickly plan to restore the ancestral estate. Then he talked about the banditry in the village. He sighed at the incompetence of the officials and soldiers, and recounted his encounter with a thief on the way to Beijing. From the village to Datong, there are more than two hundred li of dry road. Zou could travel back and forth in three days in his prime. Although he is old now, he is still healthy, and because he could not find a companion, he traveled alone. Not long after passing Qingyang, he saw a person sitting and resting under a tree by the side of the road. The person called out to Zou from afar: "Old man, are you going to Datong?" Zou said yes. The person then introduced himself as a shopkeeper collecting goods for a tea company and asked to travel together. Zou did not suspect anything and traveled together for about ten li. When they reached a desolate plateau, the person suddenly pulled out a short blade from his side and threatened Zou. Zou was startled and took out the money bag, about a hundred yuan, which was entrusted to him by the villagers to buy goods in Beijing. The thief checked it briefly and only took twenty yuan. He returned the rest to Zou, saying, "Judging by your appearance, you seem to be a poor man. Twenty yuan is enough for me. You can take the rest." Zou was thanking him when the thief glared and said, "The money is temporarily for you, but you must leave your clothes. My poor brothers have been longing for this quilted robe for who knows how many years. You can make another one with the money. Don't be stingy with this." Zou pleaded that he was old and afraid of the cold. The thief shouted loudly, threw Zou to the ground, and forcibly stripped him of his clothes. The bag Zou was carrying was also robbed. Before leaving, the thief returned five yuan to Zou, saying, "This is to compensate you for the value of the clothes. I think it should be enough." Zou said that the person seemed to be still young and had a rather refined appearance. He did not know why he would stoop to thievery, and yet he was so indifferent to money. It was truly strange.</p>
<h3>Encountering a Gigolo</h3>
<p>— Yu'an</p>
<p>On the morning of February 26th, a laughable and pitiful thing happened at No. 5, Lane 5, Yanqing Li. First, a man and a woman rented a room here. Everyone thought they were husband and wife, but they did not know that they were in an illegal relationship. Even less did they know that the man belonged to the gigolo type. Their life was quite extravagant. The woman was about the age of a blooming flower, while the man seemed to have no permanent occupation. That day, they suddenly moved out, but they had already rented a house somewhere a few days ago. As there were many boxes and objects, the man specially went to a moving company and hired a moving truck to transport the furniture. After several hours of busy work, all the valuables were happily loaded onto the truck, ready to go to the new house. The man suddenly frowned and complained of severe abdominal pain, unable to walk. The woman was startled and asked him what was wrong. The man said it was nothing, and quickly asked her to buy a yuan's worth of opium paste. Smoking it would immediately cure him. The woman did as he said and went to buy it. When she returned, both the man and the truck had disappeared. She was very surprised and thought that the abdominal pain had stopped, and he had gone to the new house without waiting for her return. However, she was also surprised and uneasy. She rushed to the new house, but the doors were tightly closed and there was no sound, unlike someone who had just moved in. She knocked on the door and asked the landlord if anyone had come. He said no. So she waited there. After a long time, the moving truck still did not arrive. She knew that something was wrong and returned to Yanqing Li. She asked the watchman if he had seen a truck leaving the neighborhood. The watchman said, "Yes, but it left a long time ago." The woman asked, "What was it carrying?" The watchman said, "It was carrying many things. I remember it was a moving truck from a moving company near the Great World." The woman could not help but lose color. She then rushed to the vicinity of the Great World and found a moving company. She asked if their company had been hired to move a house at No. 5, Lane 5, Yanqing Li today. She asked where the furniture from No. 5 had been taken. The company did not acknowledge it and said, "This company has not been hired by anyone from Yanqing Li. The truck that was hired must have been from another company." The woman had no choice but to return to her old residence, which was now an empty house. Her clothes and money had all been packed and taken away by the man. Her current life is very difficult, and she has no place to eat or sleep. Although she wanted to stay in her old residence, she could not. Alas! Truly pitiable and laughable. Shanghai is a den of all evils. Such events are not surprising. When I lived in Tongfu Li, I saw a neighbor girl abandon her boyfriend and run away with all his belongings, causing huge losses. People call it "releasing a white pigeon." It seems that I have also seen it reported in this newspaper. Now that I am living in Yanqing Li, I have encountered this gigolo. According to what this woman tearfully told people, they had been together for several years. Most of her savings had been spent, and the rest went with the truck. The clothes and furniture were probably worth several hundred gold coins. How unjust! I don't know how many foolish men and women there are in Shanghai who are deceived by the opposite sex and cannot wake up until the final act. To say it is pitiable and laughable is truly not enough to gloat over their misfortune.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Buddhist Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>My friend Hua Fo is talented at satirizing the world and encouraging virtue. Through the power of the writing brush, he thinks deeply and explores, making a great vow: to have a ten-thousand-Buddha building for offerings. Since leaving the stage in recent years, he has closed himself off and studied diligently, year after year, spending his days painting Buddhas. The majestic and wonderful images are infinitely varied. He recently held a public exhibition at the World Moral Society Hall on Jing'an Temple Road, displaying his masterpieces in one hall. The venue sold newly printed books of Hua Fo's sculpted images, which were antique-style, with inscriptions by famous people, making them valuable. He places the purpose of promoting Buddhist teachings into the paintings and is a unique and colorful figure in the art world.</p>
<p>I heard that Hua Fo is planning a trip to Southeast Asia soon to commemorate the mausoleum of Sakyamuni in Ceylon and to visit the birthplace of Buddhism in India, exploring the origins and embracing his courage to do good and his unwavering perseverance to transform people with virtue and handle affairs with sincerity. His indomitable spirit will eventually lead to great success. Inspired by my observations, I wrote this as a record.</p>
<h3>Common Sense About Eating</h3>
<p>— Zhunmei</p>
<p>The sturgeon is an ancient fish, also known as "Zhan," commonly called "armored." It can grow to be ten to twenty feet long and has no scales but bony plates on its back. Its mouth is near its lower jaw and it has whiskers. Both its fat and flesh are yellow. It lives in rivers and deep waters. It can be cooked with pork, and the taste is exceptionally rich and delicious. Restaurants in the Wu region (present-day Jiangsu and Zhejiang) are particularly skilled at preparing it. Therefore, the novelist Xu Zhiyan greatly loved this dish. Every time he traveled to the Wu region, he would always have sturgeon with his wine. However, this fish should not be eaten with milk; if eaten together, it will congeal and be difficult to digest, which is detrimental to health. The physical education expert Feng Ziping, confident in his robust health, did not believe this. One day, he consumed an entire bowl of sturgeon and a container of milk. After eating, he went to sleep. In the middle of the night, he woke up with excruciating pain. He remained weak for over a month before gradually recovering. Yesterday, Ziping sent me a letter, mentioning his recent condition. I recorded this incident to warn the food lovers of the world not to suffer the same misfortune. According to food science, there are often two types of food that are incompatible and should not be eaten together, such as crabs and persimmons, cucumbers and peanuts, glutinous rice and dried beef. Eating them together can cause illness or even death. The reason behind this phenomenon is not easily explained.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (137)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Several Celebrated Scholars Laugh and Play Hide-and-Seek, A Charming Woman Willfully Offers Protection.</p>
<p>But he was also a little afraid of offending Ruiyun. On the one hand, he wanted to make a fortune off her, and on the other hand, he could only flatter her obsequiously. As long as it didn't affect his business, he was willing to let things slide. It turned out that the first aunt had a lover. She rented a room on the upper floor as a small apartment. Every day at twelve o'clock, she would go back to spend intimate time with her old lover. When she saw them playing cards, she also outwardly approved, saying, "Very good, very good. You guys are just having some fun. But don't play too late. At most, play eight rounds. Otherwise, the second young master will also get back too late." She also instructed the maid to be careful and not get confused. After the first aunt left, it was entirely Ruiyun's world. Zuo Shichen played cards with them, but he was just humoring them. In other words, he was humoring Ruiyun. At that time, there was Shichen, Ruiyun, and Ajin, only three people. Sometimes they would try to pull in the younger aunt, who also liked to play cards. However, Ruiyun didn't welcome her because she acted a bit too serious, putting on the airs of an elder. The younger aunt had a foster daughter named Hanyun, who was one year older than Ruiyun. She suggested that Hanyun join them to make it a four-person game. But Hanyun often refused, saying that she didn't have any money. Ruiyun would pout and say, "If you don't come, you'll be breaking up the game. Three people are one short, causing bad luck." Shichen would then quietly say to Hanyun, "Just come. If you lose, I'll cover it. If you win, you can keep it." But this couldn't be known by Ruiyun. At this time, Zuo Shichen's psychology was completely like that of someone coaxing a child, meaning he wanted to make the child happy in her heart, which in turn made himself happy. Sometimes he knew that Ruiyun had a great hand or was clearly going for a flush, yet he would deliberately discard the card she needed. As soon as he discarded it, he would feign regret and try to take it back, but Ruiyun would grab it, saying that once a card was discarded, it couldn't be taken back. She would then quickly win with her great hand. Her triumphant and elated expression seemed as if she would fly to the heavens. At this time, among the four people at the table, Hanyun had nothing at stake anyway. If she lost, it was Zuo the second young master's money. Ruiyun's triumphant laughter really seemed like she had defeated a great general. Shichen was lost in thought, and watching Ruiyun's delight simply made him distracted. Only the foolish Ajin repeatedly complained to Zuo Shichen, saying, "Second young master, you shouldn't have discarded that card. It was obvious that Miss Annan was going for a flush." Shichen would then say, "Is it okay if I pay for everything?" This kind of card game was only like a filial son playing cards with his old mother, just to make her happy. Later, during the Republic of China era, there was a group of warlords like Zhang Xun and Zhang Zuolin. Their subordinates would also play cards with these great warlords in the same way. He never thought that Zuo Shichen would also use this method to play cards with Ruiyun.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Weekend Financial Market Quiet</p>

<h3>◎ Gold Prices Approaching 520 Taels</h3>
<p>▲ The Surge is Wild and Reaching a Boiling Point</p>
<p>▲ Attention Should Be Paid to the Future</p>
<p>The upward trend of gold on the first of March was unstoppable, revealing a rare and unprecedented peak, approaching 520 taels. The overseas silver price plummeted, with no end in sight. As a result, foreign exchange rates drastically contracted, with listed prices revised downward three times, and the black market also tightened significantly. However, overall, there was more supply than demand. Banks had an exceptionally strong appetite, and inter-dealer transactions were exceeding supply. Major players like Yu Da, Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, Yuan Sheng, and head-hunters were actively buying, while Wan Xing Shun, Li Tai Xing, Yuan Xing Yong, etc., were selling. Prices soared extremely sharply, and sentiment was unusually excited. Since the large drop in the morning market, prices had surged by more than eight taels. Due to active buying, prices gradually climbed to 519.5 taels, with only fluctuations of two or three taels. By noon, sellers seemed more active, leading to a sharp decline of three taels. Afterwards, prices resumed their upward trend. Overall, the situation was characterized by rapid and turbulent movements, with fluctuations of two or three taels, which was not surprising. The end result was between 518 taels. Given this situation, it is uncertain where the upward trend will stop. Yesterday was the weekend, and the afternoon market was closed as usual. As for the London silver bar, the near-term contract decreased by nine-sixteenths, and the forward contract decreased by one-half. The silver price also decreased by one and three-eighths pence, and exchange rates fluctuated.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>The Yarn Market Turns Strong After Covering Shorts</p>
<p>The situation of the yarn market turning upward is relatively promising, but most people's psychology remains pessimistic due to the many rumors of the current situation. The overseas cotton market has stabilized, and the actual sales of the customer gangs have also gradually improved, especially the smooth path for group yarns. Therefore, a portion of them took the opportunity to massively cover shorts, and the market situation was stimulated by them. The buying attitude of major players remains quiet. If actual sales can develop step by step, it will not be difficult for the market to move forward.</p>
<p>▲ The Ren Biao No. 34 Exclusively Absorbed 5,000 to 6,000 Bales. The market opened before the Ren Biao due to the calm overseas cotton market. One household massively purchased No. 34, and the market situation vibrated. The buying sentiment in the market was relatively tight, and each market rose. All months rose by 6 mace to 1 tael, 1 mace to 3 mace. In the afternoon, it was heard that major players were offsetting, and the demand for existing yarns was good. The situation remained popular, and each month rose again by 7 to 8 mace. It was found that No. 34 purchased 5,000 to 6,000 bales in both the front and back markets. The total transactions for the whole day were estimated at 20,500 bales. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

<h3>◎ The Cotton Market Rises with Gold Prices</h3>
<p>▲ Han Biao Jumps Up 5 Mace... No Spot Transactions Opened</p>
<p>The cotton market is very firm, and the upward trend is becoming stronger. Although overseas cotton is not unique, exchange rates are advancing rapidly, and the gold price is soaring. The cotton market is again being raised. Because the local market price in Hanzhong is high and firm, the Hanzhong Gang will close the current price and not sell it, so there is a special lack of chips. The situation is becoming increasingly tense, but each factory's actual sales are still waiting and seeing and not advancing, and the transactions of purchasing Indian cotton and Chinese cotton are very clear. The Hanzhong Biao of the Exchange opened in the front market, and the market atmosphere was quite tight. No. 66 massively covered shorts, totaling 3,800 loads. Retail buying was also strong, and each month rose by 3.5 to 5 Mace. In the afternoon, a portion was closed, falling back 1 mace to 1 mace 5 fen. The total transactions for the whole day were estimated at 39,700 loads. No spot cotton transactions were opened, and there were no arrivals at the wharves. The closing prices of Hanzhong Biao are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>◎Weekly Report on the Significant Fall in American Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>▲Reducing Cotton Fields Receives Extensive Assistance</p>
<p>▲Assistance to the Wheat Market May Extend to the Cotton Market</p>
<p>A New York dispatch on the 28th reports on the cotton market situation for the week: This week, cotton fell to a new low for the season under significant liquidation pressure, triggered by the distribution of March notices and the weakness in wheat prices. Active demand from the trade prevented a precipitous decline in prices. Subsequently, as there were more buyers than sellers, prices rebounded. It is reported that groups related to the Department of Agriculture are buying large quantities of wheat, and those short in the cotton market are thus covering their positions, believing that a further decline in cotton prices would trigger similar assistance in the wheat market. Overall, although sentiment in the cotton market is not yet stable, it appears that many parties have already closed out significant positions. It is rumored that the movement to reduce cotton fields is now receiving assistance from many bankers, merchants, and cotton field leaders, although local merchants still have doubts about active reduction. Trading in new contracts has begun, with initial prices 20 to 25 points lower than the old contracts at the same time. It is also reported that government assistance to the wheat market may extend to the cotton market. There have been many transactions in new cotton futures, presumably due to purchases by the trade. Demand for spot cotton is limited, and the domestic cotton cloth market remains mixed. Attached below are the weekend statistics for American cotton (in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Standard Flour Soars</p>
<p>▲The Subsequent Market Retraces Slightly After a Rapid Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening bell in the flour market, prices for various months showed an enthusiastic state again. The degree of rise was comparable to the violent surge of the previous week. Because the quotation for imported wheat rose again by one yuan, it already had the opportunity to flourish, and the opening price for standard flour created an unprecedented new record with an opening price of 578 taels. The exchange rate was naturally unimaginable, so people's hearts were greatly lifted. The opening price for this month was as high as 2 taels, 5 mace, 6 fen, 2 li, and 5 hao. Compared to the closing price in February, there was a difference of about 4.5 fen. Even the closing price for March of the previous month rose invisibly by 3 fen. The prices for April and May also rose by about 3 fen each. By the time the afternoon session opened, due to the excessive surge, this month's price fell back slightly by 1 fen. April and May prices mostly hovered, and June and July prices were slightly better because they were new flour. August's price was opened for the first time, and the fluctuation was very small. In the end, this month's price was better by 1 fen and 7.5 li compared to the closing price at the end of the previous month, April's price was better by 2.5 fen, May's price was better by 2 fen and 2.5 li, June's price was better by 7.5 li, July's price was better by 5 li, and August's price was better by 2.5 li compared to the initial price.</p>
<h3>◎Recent Wheat Market Boils</h3>
<p>▲Spot Wheat Asking Price Raised by Four to Five Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw rapid rebounds in the March and April markets after the morning and afternoon openings, reaching their peak. Although the highest price for March rose to 5 taels, 1 mace, and 7 fen, a huge increase of 1 mace and 2 fen compared to the price at the end of the previous month, the highest price for April also reached 5 taels and 3 fen, also an increase of 1 mace and 2 fen. This kind of rebound was partly based on the price of foreign wheat and partly due to the scarcity of the new crop, so it easily reached its peak at the slightest opportunity. However, whether the foreign market price can change again should be considered by both parties. June and July were also slightly higher due to their proximity, and the opening and closing prices for August were both 4 taels and 2 mace and 9 fen, with little difference. The recent afternoon saw a slight decrease due to the excessive surge. In the end, this month's price rose by 9 fen compared to the end of the previous month, April's price rose by 9 fen, and June and July prices each rose by 2 fen. Spot wheat rebounded strongly, and the asking price also increased by 4 to 5 fen. Qingjiangpu wheat opened at 5 taels, 1 mace, and 2 fen; Suqian wheat at 5 taels, 1 mace, and 2 fen; Hankou wheat at 5 taels, 4 taels, 9 mace, and 7 fen; Gaoyou wheat at 5 taels and 1 mace; Wuhu wheat at 5 taels; and Jiangxi wheat at 5 taels and 4 fen. A total of 7,000 bags were opened and handled by China Family.</p>
<h3>◎Spot Foreign Rice Continues to Rise by One Dime</h3>
<p>▲Foreign Firms Hold and Do Not Sell ▲Two Ships Arrive Last Night</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot foreign rice continued to improve due to the excellent appetite in the countryside. The local market was also greedy, and the market situation became more promising. Furthermore, as the exchange rate shrank again and the price of gold increased, it became more difficult for foreign firms to place orders, so there were no sales, and people became more hopeful. The spot price immediately rose by one dime, and revolving futures also rose by three to five fen. There was not much stock in the spot market, only 1,500 bags of special No. 1 Saigon were offered at a price of 15 yuan, 1 dime, and 2 fen to 15 yuan, and more than 2,000 bags of small milled rice were offered at a price of 13 yuan and 4.5 jiao. However, as two ships, a Japanese mail ship and a French company ship, arrived last night, the market price for goods today and tomorrow may be temporarily fixed and not surprising.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Prohibits Foreign Merchants from Importing Tea</p>
<p>Our country's Gongxi green tea has an annual output of about 100,000 to 200,000 boxes. In addition to about 20,000 to 30,000 boxes sold to Mumbai, Afghanistan, Persia, and other places, the rest all rely on sales to Russia. Since the Middle East Incident occurred last year, Russian firms have stopped operating. Later, Sino-Russian negotiations began, and White Russian merchants in Shanghai, seeing the Russian people's fondness for Chinese tea and the extremely low tea prices, all began to buy in bulk to prepare for sales in Russia. It is now reported that the Soviet Russian government, on the pretext that Russians will come to China to purchase, has uniformly prohibited the entry of tens of thousands of boxes of green tea transported by Persian merchants.</p>
