<p>時評</p>
<h3>波蘭選舉畢蘇斯基派勝利</h3>
<p>此次波蘭選舉。狄克推多之畢蘇斯基派又大占勝利。此後畢氏必益將斷然實施其改革波蘭之主張而不顧其他一切之反對在彼得勢之時。必更以重大壓力加諸各派。各派雖欲聯合反抗。而亦無能爲力。故自前之政局。或可不致有變。即有反響。恐亦尙在其後。故今日波蘭之内政。僅可謂在危機隱伏之時。而非危機暴發時也。今日所慮危機之暴發者則在對德之外交。自和會劃定德波疆界而後德人即表示憤懣不平。近復時時隱露其重劃邊界之意見。於是波蘭之愛國男兒。乃大激昻。猶憶數月前。曾隸畢蘇斯基部下參與恢復獨立戰爭之兵士開年會時。通過議案。誓以最後一滴血。保衛邊界疆土之完全。民衆又於興登堡誕生地。集五萬餘人。舉行大示威。以反對德國修正德波邊界之運動。𤍠誠慷慨實所罕見。今不幸爲競爭選舉事。又牽動民族問題。引起德國嚴重之抗議。畢蘇斯基得勢而後。當然主張强硬外交。對德决不肯稍稍示弱。由是以觀。波德國際間之裂痕。幾有岌岌不可終日之勢。吾故謂今日波蘭外交上之危機。較其内政上之危機爲尤顯也。</p>

<h3>怪異之病</h3>
<p>— 公羽</p>
<p>天下之大無奇不有。舉凡一切意想所及之事勿論若何怪誕。世間迨無不有之。有時且出乎意想以外。故西游記雖爲一部道書。寓言滿紙然旣爲意想所及。筆之於書。又安知世間無此神通廣大之石猴也茲志一怪異之病。即爲人之意想所不及。而居然有此事實者病者爲一八十老嫗。徐姓。夫尙健在。有子名生寳。居常熟西塘市北之西莊。初嫗患病將十年。　綿床褥。百藥罔效其夫其子。皆以嫗年邁。病起無望徒擲醫藥之資於虚牝而巳孰意至今年。嫗忽自愈步履如常。一無龍鍾老態舉家方欣然色喜。及見嫗病若失。其精神體魄。竟健於壯婦。能攀樑上屋。矯捷無倫。如擅輕身術。則大訝。蓋常病失而轉攖非常之病也。嫗自攖怪病。語言行動。靡不反常最可怪者。嫗恒大呼「我要吃心肝了」。或曰牛心肝或曰羊心肝。家人雖目爲囈語。然察其狀果似饑極而索食者。非信口胡道可比與以普通飲食。又拒不受。大呼吃心肝不巳。適附近人家有牛羊病斃。剝而剖之則心肝皆杳。不禁譁然稱異事。以爲牛羊心肝果爲嫗所食。顧嫗又未嘗出外，究具何術。而能攝牛羊心肝。抑囈語巧合耶。此事喧傳遐邇。鄰人之膽小者。且惴惴焉慮嫗能殺人。對嫗之夫與子迭提警告。須撲殺嫗。以除一方之害。夫與子亦甚恐怖。然若遵鄰人警告。下撲殺之毒手。則又踟蹰有所未忍也。不謂鄰人意想所及之預慮。未幾竟亦實現。有某氏婦。臥病匝月矣。藥之不愈歷久益劇卒不能起。先一夕。婦昏沉之際。忽狂呼「徐嫗來了。在床上吃我心肝呢。痛呀。」其音慘厲。色隨聲變。家人惶駭莫名。環集床邊並持燈遍燭。初無何等跡象。而病婦仍呼痛不止。亟速醫來。診視有頃。曰。囈語耳。邪入心包絡所致。其家巳夙聞徐嫗怪。不信醫言故於婦逝世後。往徐家理論。終以事蹟離奇毫無實證。不能謂婦即爲嫗所殺經魯連勸解而罷。然鄰人惴惴之心則因此愈甚。羣議將嫗置之死。嫗子生寳巳表同意。而其夫則堅持反對。羣議乃寢。今嫗被其夫錮閉房中。不許越雷池一步。遂亦未生他異。而其反常之語言行動。則依然如故。盛夏時。嫗擁絮酣臥。不覺其暖。究不知果爲何病也。</p>
<h3>金魚展覽預志</h3>
<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>蘇州公園。爲應潮流之需要。發展民衆事業起見。每月舉行同樂會一次。其間娛樂方針取公開而富興趣者爲主。上月如菊花會其一也。近據確訊謂下月中旬有金魚會之舉。金魚本怡情養性之品。爲一般人所愛玩。倘用以點綴園林池沼爲尤不可少。第此物畜養匪易。非具專門經騐終難望其長存。較諸培植花草爲尤難公園原有金魚十餘種。專雇魚人飼養久爲游侶所屬目頃復有斯會之創亦屬空前盛舉聞該園刻正託人向滬潯一帶廣事徵集細種即蘇地各金魚園亦多樂予加入云。</p>
<h3>銀壇近訊</h3>
<p>觀綠林驕子之後　日前承卡爾登徐君約。往觀五彩巨片綠林驕子之試映。歸後徐君囑爲文以揄揚之。余之所欲言者。　此片之精彩。集中於男主角羅倫斯蒂伯一人。而此片之偉大亦即蒂伯箇人之偉大。蒂伯者非徒綠林之驕子。亦即天之驕子。蒂伯者男子中最健美。最豪邁。世無其匹之男子也。蒂伯之歌喉。其雄偉沈鬱處。除歌聖克羅梭之外。應少頡頏。至其體魄之雄偉。在其受鞭撻時可見之。誠天下之最美健者。人孰得而此擬之。謂之綠林驕子固宜。謂之天之驕子。亦何獨不宜。人尙有對於此點抱懷疑者。觀蒂伯此片之後。此疑可釋。蒂伯者。本紐約大都會歌劇公司之中音名角。此次居然爲米曲羅影片公司所羅致。並能籍有聲片之介紹。將天賦雄偉之歌喉。移之於銀幕之上。吾人聲色之好以償。安得不自喜自　。至於該片全部五彩布局之精等等。皆其餘事。不必　言之矣。（金　煦）</p>
<p>觀試映色界魔王後　世風日薄。色慾横流。試觀　年男女。每遇談及戀愛之事。莫不欣然色喜。是誠可慨。余白觀「色界魔王」影片後。遂益覺有感於中焉。該片爲大明星約翰吉爾勃所主演。述一紈袴。仗其萬惡之金錢。及誘惑之伎倆。朝　暮楚。專以玩弄女子爲能事甚至友之未婚妻。亦思染指。一念之差。遂致演成種種慘劇。被棄之舊情人。因以自殺。而情人之夫。亦因此喪命。結果雖能覺悟懺悔。但良心上之汚點。巳永遠不能泯滅此爲該片之約略情節蓋不啻萬惡社會中之一幅寫眞圖也。約翰吉爾勃。素以善演風流劇聞於世。凡觀過「肉體與情魔」及「愛」等片者。對於彼之藝術度巳有相當之認識。而在「色界魔王」片中。其表演之深刻。態度之倜儻。尤勝於前荒唐時之浪漫温馨。令人心醉神移懺悔時之幽鬱悲憤。又足令人迥腸盪氣。自始至終。無懈可擊。今該片聞巳公映於巴黎大戲院云。（伴雲）</p>
<h3>記異蛇</h3>
<p>— 君碩</p>
<p>客顧孟賢紹興人，述少時飲於烟戚家賞蘭雅集也郡中某宦新自山右歸帶有汾酒因命僕取至。以供諸友。色油油碧綠云名竹葉靑座客咸宜謂以名酒賞名花此會可云不負今以名矣。客張君曰。竹葉靑本係古名此酒甚當惟又有毒蛇亦名竹葉靑。聞父老述吾鄉有一田夫耕種山田恒出入山中山中有小蛇長不過二寸許色純綠。其毒且過於蝮蛇。相傳謂是竹葉靑。人皆避之。一日。天雨初霽田夫有事入山穿釘靴。旣而經叢菁亂草間見一巨蟒足長丈餘。在地上滾。若負痛狀。諦審之。則此巨蟒頭部。有一竹葉靑在田夫思救此蟒急舉足蹴去之。田夫非不知竹葉靑奇毒。自以釘靴之底。有革數重。且排列鐵釘當無害。旣蹴竹葉靑於地。隨踐踏之使死。而此巨蟒悠然逝矣田夫歸至家。足腫痛。不多時巳腫近腹部家人問知爲蹴踏竹葉靑所致。惶急無所措手足時巳上燈。忽見一巨蟒自窗口入。銜靑草幾葉置於地。家人見蟒。方驚駭反走而巨蟒巳去田夫曰向者即此蟒殆銜解毒草來救余也隨以草煎湯飲之痛旋己復以洗足至夜將半冋復原狀遂得無恙。審視此草形狀偏覓山中不可再得。或云殆產生深谷中非人迹所能到之歟張君語畢座客各飲一杯曰。此竹葉靑。不比彼竹葉靑。可納諸腹中也孟賢謂張君亦紹興人。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（八三）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>三十一日由商場入郵局。此地郵政入印度政治範圍矣。一盾錢當我一元三角。買郵票十六安拿。一安拿可寄信本埠。二安可寄英屬海峽殖民地。三安可寄英倫與上海。至商場則女子甚多。高髻峩峩。靚妝自喜。可與華女比矣。緬甸女子地位之高。爲各地所不及。均識字有敎育。是指導男子。萬師云緬爲世界上怕老婆之國也。衙門中只有女職員。不過其敷粉之法太粗。至有塗抹如戲子者。</p>
<p>吾於緬人男女衣冠上得一新觀察。即緬甸人完全母化而女化也。緬男人亦穿宜綠裙。與女　大分别。而上身亦然。種種花色衣。故遠望之男裝女裝無異也。尤奇者緬人戴平頂高帽。視之亦與女子高髻無異。此知其男子衣冠從項至踵。皆學自母　耳。</p>
<p>中人在此　緬婦者甚多僑生者母多緬人。然聞華人常中途回家。棄婦而去。緬女深恨華人之無良。相與不敢輕近云。</p>
<p>七月一日。萬法師約在飯店吃飯。其肴甚貴。每味以盾計約一盾半起碼較新嘉坡檳城生活加貴矣。曩在星洲見吉能人（印度勞工）以手抓飯菜而食。甚怪之。余常在吉能食店食其煎餅甚美。向彼皆以手取食入口。食後以水洗手。吾人不便。故彼特置西式刀义備唐人用。至緬甸則彼食店不常備刀义矣。大家以手抓食。吾人甚不便。但久於南洋者亦化之矣。行於街。大家露天而食。有一西少婦可二十餘。衣服麗美。正同一緬婦亦以右手抓油肉等菜而食。吾欲笑而不敢。只吟班氏東都主人喟然而嘆曰。痛乎風俗之移人也。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（三二二）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十六回　殷勤問字翠袖謁先生　慷慨談兵靑樓宴女傑</p>
<p>且說左詩晨自從在悦賓樓遇到了綠意以後。好像又着了魔了。加以友朋的慫恿排着日子吃夜飯。你請我。我請你。如此的蟬聯下去每次吃夜飯。座上無花。又嫌淸寂，因此二人更多了接近的機會。上海有好多機關巳趨於歐化。都是不供給膳宿的。白天在公司銀行裏辦事的人。往往也老遠跑到家裏去喫飯。也有的自己組織了喫飯的地方。到了晚上五點鐘以後。那些行家。有的留一兩位職員看守看守。有的簡直交給鐵將軍把門。一切都不管。而辦事人出來了以後。也恢復了自家身體了。在報館裏編輯的人。恰巧和那班人相反。那班人落工的時候。正是他們上工的時候。所以那班報館裏的編輯先生。和馬路上守夜的巡捕。絲紗廠裏開夜工的女工。以及屠宰塲裏的殺猪屠。同爲夜裏動物。有時弄到了天亮快回去。吃點稀飯點心之類。天巳大明了。到明天一睡就睡到午飯以後。起來梳洗吃飯。看看自己編輯的報。有什麽毛病沒有。眨眨眼兒。太陽又落山了。工作的時候又到了。倒是在喫夜飯的當兒。算是一個空𨻶。可以休息陶情的時候。新聞的頭一批。巳經發下去了。需報要敲過了十二點鐘。方纔上市。報館裏雖然也備好了夜飯。可是有幾個高級職員。都不願意在報館裏喫夜飯。這是有個緣故的。因爲那時候的報館裏。地方湫隘。什麽排字房。機器間。巳經是很擠的了。那裏再容得下個廚房。旣然沒有廚房。只得是吃包飯的了。那個包飯。實在是有點吃不來。一則看它的樣子。就覺得是不衛生。夏天更不心說了。蒼蠅往往似暇米一般。在飯菜裏吃出來。患着霍亂吐瀉的人。總疑心是在包飯裏出的毛病。到了冬天呢。人家總要吃些𤍠的湯。燙和飯。然而經包飯作挑到那裏。或者再一耽擱。巳成了冷冰冰的菜飯。那個暖的的肚子裏。闖進了那種食物。好像是來了一個冷面無情的客。實在不容易融化。二則包飯作裏燒出來的菜。他們是在一大鍋子裏的。包飯作越大。開的飯越多。菜也是一律平等。那一桌是這幾樣菜。這一桌也是這幾菜。他們是日食千人。因此魚啊肉啊。都是一樣的味道。而且飯米也是次等。軟硬又不調匀。所以茶房雖是來請吃夜飯。只好望望然去了。</p>

<h3>麥市在疲落中</h3>
<p>昨日麥市上下午開盤後各月份市面、又趨疲落、本月份因距交割巳近、空方均巳準備交貨、惟多頭方面雖大部份因吃虧過甚、祗得硬收、但少數之浮多、則不得不回出了結、致最低時竟低至四兩一錢實爲本年未見之新價、遠期各月份、因洋麥關係人心亦寂、各盤又步開步軟結果本月份較前日小二分十二月份小三分正·二月份小二分三月份小一分四月份小三分現貨因廠胃甚寂、到貨亦不豐全市未開云、</p>

<h3>油市白桐油趨勢平庸</h3>
<p>白桐油洋銷仍難進展、外盤無大上落、義瑞洋行購進現貨五十噸、做價十六兩四錢、惟客盤巳見回鮮、裂桐漲售十五兩二錢、内銷批盤自幾度暴跌後、各帮辦胃見濃市巳轉挺、春源等牌喊售十五兩洋例紋、愼昌等牌十四兩六錢、查現下桐油大主顧之　莊仍乏鉅量吸收、而襄桐途貨復有到漢、市面未許　觀云、</p>

<p>丨今晚有甲組六隊比賽丨</p>
<p>西靑籃球會昨晚甲乙兩組比賽、於七點五十分開始、結果（一）乙組夏光勝南鋒二十三比十四（二）甲組約翰克麥令、三十四比二十三、約翰之勝、實屬危險、陳祥龍於上半時中即以四次被罰退場形勢可危、幸最後奮鬭、侯學敏擲中多球、得以獲勝、詳情如下、</p>
<p>夏光勝南鋒（乙）</p>
<p>丨二十三比十四丨</p>
<p>第一組夏光對南鋒、表演尙稱不惡、雙方動作頗爲淸晣、但球藝似欠純熟擲籃亦少把握、以致得分甚少、夏光先以八比二佔先、南鋒奮力進取、以九比六終了上半時、夏光以三分領前、下半時起、南鋒郭基銘辛鼎奎增上三分、造成九比九之和局、但自此外後夏光球勢忽盛、陳　鯄籃下盤旋、活潑非凡、屢次擲中愽得掌聲不少、南鋒雖圖反攻、但投籃不準難有建樹而夏光方面亦抵賴陳肇鯄之功勞得以二十三比十四獲最後勝利、下半時夏光共獲十四分、全係陳肇鯄一人所得、良非易易、裁判員塔佛爾斯、</p>

<p>約翰克麥令（甲）</p>
<p>丨三十四比二十三丨</p>
<p>第二組爲甲約翰對麥令、雙方爭戰甚烈、形勢頗見平均開始交鋒、麥令　斯霍遠中、開紀錄之端、約翰二次罰球俱未命中、相持多時刁有道在籃下向後抛入一球、陳祥龍躍起拍進、二次神妙之擲法、獲得觀者之好評、約翰遂以四比二佔先、但約翰之守衛、頗見疏忽、二人常在一線、時被對手衝進、幸而麥令投籃不準、得保安全、約翰聯絡進取、侯學敏如探花蝴蝶、活潑矯捷、繼而中的、林澤　亦加一球、麥令急起直追、造成十與九比、俄而陳祥龍單手擲中、麥令蒙司兩次運動不罰、竟被偷進二分蘇台罰中、比數頗成和局、（十二比十二）約翰極力進攻、侯學敏兩次角球命中、乃又以十六十二佔先、麥令豈肯示弱、抖擻精神、奮發圖報、約翰禍從天降、中鋒陳祥龍以四次犯規撤職實力受一挫折、幸而極力保守、上半時約翰仍以十九比十三勝、</p>
<p>下半時起、相持不下、形勢頗爲緊張、惟約翰始終未曾答後、但麥令追隨於後、相差甚微、比數最接近時、爲二十三比二十一、僅差兩分、岌岌可危、約翰乃暫停時間、重振旗鼓、氣燄突然轉盛、觀者亦爲之提神、侯學敏出皮籃下、不可捉摸、一再建功、大受捧塲者之彩聲、結果約翰以三十四比二十三獲勝、侯學敏獨得念分、厥功甚偉、裁判員白蘭德、</p>

<p>汽車新聞</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>油制動機</h3>
<p>— 丁</p>
<p>屢承友好埀問油制動機之原理與動作。爰草此篇作覆。並以公諸汽車界之留意於此者。</p>
<p>油制動機（HydraulicBrake）俗稱油殺車。奭奔（Auburn）（Chrysler）順風牌（Plymoutb）（DeSoto）葛來亭（Graham）道奇（Dobge）禮和（Reo）等汽車皆採用之。美國製之汽車。幾有百分之三十。係用油制動機。可見此機之風行一時也。</p>
<p>油制動機之優點。包括（一）简單（二）靈敏（三）制動力一致（四）無全屬條桿之震動聲（五）不須潤滑油（六）不須校正等等。較之平常用條桿曳拉之制動機。實勝多多。其不利之點有二。（一）爲前後輪於同一時間制動（二）漏油時制動效力失却。</p>
<p>油制動機之原理。完全基於物理學之液體傳力法。蓋不論何種液體。决不因壓力而縮小其體積。並且以某量壓力施於該液體時。則該液體能以同量壓方傳佈於所到達之處。茲以詳圖說明之。各圖所用符號字均相同。</p>
<p>第一圖表示油制動機。最簡單之構造。W爲制動蹬。P爲總活塞。C爲總油罐。T爲油管。A爲小油罐。B爲小活塞。D爲錐形體。F爲前輪R爲後輪。S爲制動蹄。L爲制動帶。當足踏下總活塞時。總油罐内之油被壓出。由油管射入小油罐。推動小活塞。使錐形體下降。撑開制動蹄。而緊壓K制動鼓。車輪乃被鉗紛而停止其旗轉矣。迨制動蹬之壓力移去。則由J彈簧之收縮。回復原狀。使車輪自由。</p>
<h3>第一圖</h3>
<p>第二圖爲油制動機在汽車底盤上之佈置情形。M爲存油罐。爲補充油液缺少之用。C與總油罐通連。其詳見於第三圖。存油罐之頂。有一H柄。以之抽壓。則將油補充於總油罐C。但如道奇汽車。現巳將存油罐與總油罐拼合一處。且無須用手抽壓其油自能補充到總油罐内。祗須存油罐内常留半罐油即可W爲制動蹬J粗黑綫爲銅質油管。固定於底盤上。N爲軟橡皮管。一端與銅管連絡。另一端與小油罐連絡。因此一段須隨車輪顚動。故必須用橡皮管。K爲制動鼓。當用足踏下制動蹬時。總油罐内之油被擠出。分向油管射出。直達四個汽輪。以行其制動工作。</p>
<h3>第二圖</h3>
<h3>第三圖</h3>
<p>第四圖表示油制動機制動部份之詳細結搆。此種係收縮式制動（ContractingType）。L制動帶。在K制動鼓之外圈。但亦有膨脹式者。即制動帶置於制動鼓之内圈。其功用相同。不另贅述。如圖示之一種。當油自N管射入時。使A罐内之小活塞向外推出。推動兩側之E桿槓。乃同時收緊L制動帶。鉗制制動鼓K之旋　當油壓力消失時。J彈簧張開。使制動帶小活塞等回復原狀。圖中下方之　bo係表示A罐之内容。内有小活塞兩個爲油之入口。與N軟橡皮管通。　爲平時狀態。兩小活塞伏於罐内b爲制動時狀態。油巳射入。兩小活塞被推而向兩端衝出。</p>
<h3>第四圖</h3>
<p>油制動機之油。爲卑麻子油與變性酒精等量之混合液。市上有現成配合料出售。其性質務須不易凍氷。不易蒸。發及無腐蝕性爲合。</p>
<p>油制動機平時之注意。爲使之不泄漏。其漲油之處。大槪爲銅管與橡皮管連接處。平時若覺油液之耗費過多。則必有漏油處。可使一人重踏制動蹬。另一人察看油管所至之處。尋出漏油處而修復之。</p>
<p>油制動機之小油罐不易損壞。其結構甚精緻。必須用特種工具方可拆開。修理時不必拆開。如確定巳損壞。亦有整個現貨可配。否則徒勞無功也。</p>
<p>當油制動機巳經修理或更換橡皮管之後。有一極要之工作不可忽略。即油管内不可容留空氣。蓋空氣之體積可以升縮。留於油管内。即使油壓力不平均。實一大弊。在小油罐上有一放氣洞。平常用螺絲釘塞住。放氣時先開放此洞。用足踏制動蹬數下。視洞内射出之油。不再有氣泡爲止。即表示空氣巳完全排出。此項工作。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>每次使一個制動機放氣。然後輪流至其他。不可於同時使四個制動機一齊放氣。又於制動鼓巳拆下之後。不可再踏制動　。否則小油罐内之小活塞有被壓出之可能。致損壞重要部分。</p>
<h3>一九三一年式之新納喜汽車</h3>
<p>— 吉人</p>
<p>有八缸車三種　六缸車一種</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Encourages Executive Yuan Staff</h3>
<p>The Most Important Work Going Forward</p>
<p>To Establish a Comprehensive Policy Plan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek, who also serves as the President of the Executive Yuan, was sworn into office yesterday. This morning at 9:00 AM, he convened a meeting at the National Government Auditorium with senior officials (rank of Jianren and above) from the Yuan and its affiliated ministries and commissions. Present were Vice President Song Ziwen, ministry heads Niu Yongjian, Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Jiang Menglin, Wang Boqun, Wang Zhengting, Yi Peiji, Yang Shuzhuang, Zeng Yangfu, and other Jianren officials, totaling about 300 people. His address was as follows: "Following the orders of the Central Committee, I, Chiang Kai-shek, am concurrently serving as the President of the Executive Yuan. As I take office, I would like to briefly explain the Central Committee's intention in resolving to improve the system and revitalize politics at the Fourth Plenary Session, as well as my determination to dedicate myself to this task after receiving the order, and my expectations for my colleagues in the Yuan, its affiliated ministries and commissions, and the governments of various provinces and cities. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the inefficiency of the administration and the neglect of national affairs have remained unchanged, a fact that is universally acknowledged and undeniable. However, before today, my colleagues could still justify themselves with two explanations: first, that frequent rebellions and military instability made it impossible to address all the pressing issues. This was the main reason why, despite the sincere efforts of the administrative sector, efficiency remained low; and second, that the system was not yet perfect, and the division of authority and responsibility was not clear enough. The heads of the Yuan's ministries and commissions did not attend State Council meetings and were not directly responsible to the National Government, which resulted in the inability of administrative meetings to conduct systematic research, and the lack of close coordination between the ministries and commissions. Even if there were localized improvements, it would still be difficult to remedy the overall disorganization. Both of these explanations have some validity, but colleagues with a strong sense of responsibility should still examine their own faults and not attribute everything to external obstacles. Moreover, after today, rebellions have been suppressed, politics should return to normal, the system has been improved, and the division of authority and responsibility is clear, leaving no room for shirking or evading responsibility. The Fourth Plenary Session conducted a rigorous examination of the actual work of past politics and concluded that without reforming the system, it would be impossible to achieve close coordination; without reducing the number of agencies, it would be impossible to ensure efficient work; and without governing with the spirit of disciplined and solemn military administration, it would be impossible to reverse the prevailing decadent atmosphere. Therefore, the session made appropriate modifications to the central system, the most important of which was to change the previous Administrative Council into the State Council, so that the heads of the Yuan's ministries and commissions could be directly responsible to the government. Furthermore, the selection of the Yuan's president was entrusted to me, Chiang Kai-shek. My colleagues should understand that the Central Committee values this Yuan and has high expectations for all of you, and you must not repeat the bad habits of wastefulness and laxity. At a time when military reconstruction is underway, and we are focusing all our efforts on suppressing the communist bandits and completing local autonomy, if the administrative sector continues to be characterized by sluggishness, procrastination, disunity, and chaos, then the reform of politics will ultimately fail to keep pace with military progress, the communist bandits will ultimately not be eradicated, and local autonomy will be impossible to implement. The work of eradicating the communist bandits is only a superficial solution, while politics is the only way to eliminate the root cause, and the promotion of local autonomy must be based on the enlightenment of the central government. Low administrative efficiency is tantamount to creating opportunities for the communist bandits, and a decadent central government cannot serve as a model for the localities. If things come to this, my colleagues will not only fail to meet the high expectations of the Central Committee, but will also betray the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the revolution. I, Chiang Kai-shek, am of meager talent and ability, but I accepted this order because I deeply believe in the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's teaching that the revolution has not yet succeeded, and my comrades must continue to work hard. I am also mindful of the fact that over the past few years, countless soldiers have sacrificed their lives and countless people have lost their property, and the biggest reason for this is that we have failed to implement a revolutionary political system that corresponds to military progress. I dare not rest for a moment and abandon my revolutionary duty. Therefore, while focusing on military affairs, I must also devote myself to administration, and I especially hope to apply the spirit of disciplined and solemn military administration to governance. Whether or not this aspiration can be achieved depends on the support and encouragement of my colleagues. In accordance with the principle of 'a gentleman loves others with virtue,' I will not be lenient in my demands of my colleagues. In my proposals to the Fourth Plenary Session, I have summarized the political habits that should be corrected and the measures that should be improved. These include: first, the division of authority and responsibility is not clear enough; second, the appointment of officials is not based on clear standards; third, there is a lack of respect for the system; fourth, there is laxity and irresponsibility; fifth, the corruption cannot be completely eliminated; sixth, there is a lack of understanding of the essentials of politics, which leads to trivialities and competition with the people for profits; and seventh, there is procrastination, indecision, and favoritism, which prevents the ability to bear resentment. My colleagues should constantly and earnestly examine and rigorously inspect these seven points in the future, and correct them if they exist, and work harder if they do not. My colleagues should first realize that they are an integral part of the entire government. While they should faithfully perform their duties in their respective areas of responsibility, they must also consider the overall policy direction of the government and not focus solely on the development of their own departments at the expense of the overall situation, or even usurp and infringe on the rights of others. With regard to financial revenues and expenditures, they must strictly adhere to the trial budget procedures and auditing methods promulgated by the Central Committee. The revenues of their respective departments must not be regarded as the exclusive property of their departments, and they must not be kept separately and arbitrarily disposed of, thereby reducing the national revenue and undermining the unity of accounting. My colleagues must also understand that they are members of the revolutionary government, and they must seek fairness in the appointment of officials and integrity in their own conduct. They must not engage in any corrupt practices or commercialized tendencies, and they must not be criticized for monopolizing and profiting at the expense of the public. They must not treat public funds as if they are inexhaustible and arbitrarily squander them. My colleagues should carefully consider this and be vigilant. They must not harm the country for the sake of personal favors or private interests, and they must not be constrained by sentimentality or shield corrupt and incompetent officials, which would be extremely harmful to the country and the people. What I use to encourage myself and my colleagues is to never forget that we are an integral part of the entire government and a member of the revolutionary government. The most important task of the Yuan in the future is to establish a comprehensive policy plan, and all ministries and commissions must cooperate and collaborate within this plan to achieve progress. Second, we must supervise the ministries and commissions to accurately prepare budgets. The Yuan will be responsible for allocating funds for the budgets approved by the Yuan, and there will be no shortage. The heads of the ministries and commissions should be responsible for the temporary use of funds that are not included in the budget but are truly needed, and which have been approved by the Yuan. Third, we must rigorously assess the personnel of the ministries and commissions to determine whether there is bias in their appointments, whether there is laxity in their administration, and whether there is extravagance in the use of funds. The heads of the ministries and commissions should also rigorously assess the subordinate agencies in this way, and if there are those who neglect their duties, engage in favoritism, commit fraud, or seek illegal profits, they must be punished according to the law without any leniency. The heads of the ministries and commissions should regard the dereliction of duty of their subordinates as their own dereliction of duty. Only in this way can we hope for a clean and enlightened government. From today onward, my colleagues in the Yuan and its ministries and commissions should adhere to this policy and focus on their duties. If they can faithfully perform their duties, they will not be easily transferred. Those who are lazy, neglect their duties, infringe on authority, inflate budgets, disregard laws and regulations, or even dare to engage in fraudulent practices for personal gain, I, Chiang Kai-shek, will, in order to uphold the authority of the revolutionary government and uphold the discipline of the revolutionary government, break through all considerations of sentimentality and punish them according to the severity of their offenses, without any leniency. To my colleagues who work in the provincial and municipal governments, I was unable to gather them together today to meet and talk, but I hope they will also understand this intention. As the saying goes, 'Governance does not depend on many words, but on how well it is practiced.' But I cannot refrain from offering my colleagues advice. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will abide by the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session and diligently implement them, and that they will constantly urge me to work together so that we may not be ashamed to face the spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and the martyrs in heaven, and that it may be a great fortune for the party and the nation." After the address, a photograph was taken at the National Government, and then the first State Council meeting was held in the National Government's conference room. (Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Pilsudski Faction Wins Polish Election</h3>
<p>In the recent Polish election, the Pilsudski faction, a dictatorship, once again achieved a major victory. In the future, Pilsudski will undoubtedly implement his proposals for reforming Poland decisively, disregarding all opposition. While he holds power, he will exert even greater pressure on various factions. Although these factions may wish to unite in opposition, they will be powerless to do so. Therefore, the previous political situation may not change. Even if there are repercussions, they will likely come later. Thus, the internal affairs of Poland today can only be described as being in a state of latent crisis, rather than an outbreak of crisis. The imminent outbreak of crisis lies in its foreign relations with Germany. Since the delineation of the German-Polish border by the Treaty of Versailles, the Germans have expressed resentment and dissatisfaction. Recently, they have repeatedly hinted at their desire to redraw the border. As a result, the patriotic men of Poland have become greatly agitated. I recall that a few months ago, when soldiers who had served under Pilsudski in the war of independence held their annual meeting, they passed a resolution vowing to defend the complete integrity of the border with their last drop of blood. The public also gathered 50,000 people in Hindenburg's birthplace to hold a large demonstration against Germany's movement to revise the German-Polish border. Their sincerity and generosity are truly rare. Unfortunately, the competition for elections has once again stirred up national issues, provoking serious protests from Germany. With Pilsudski in power, he will naturally advocate a tough foreign policy and will never show weakness towards Germany. From this perspective, the rift between Germany and Poland is on the verge of collapse. Therefore, I believe that the crisis in Poland's foreign relations is even more evident than the crisis in its internal affairs.</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>British and Indian Politicians Begin Drafting a Federal Constitution</h3>
<p>The problem is complex and difficult to solve</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 25th - After the plenary session of the Indian Round Table Conference concluded, prominent British and Indian politicians immediately engaged in the major task of drafting a federal constitution. The speeches of the Indian delegates had a significant impact; listeners and readers alike were astonished by their talent and rhetoric. It can truly be said that the Indian delegates have changed the British people's attitude towards the Indian problem. The most noteworthy fact is the unanimity between the Indian princes and British India in demanding a federation during the plenary session. However, after the conference, a Reuters reporter learned from private conversations that doubts still remain about whether a federal system that can be adapted to the requirements of Indian autonomy can be crafted. Important non-Muslim representatives are currently exchanging views privately and feel that there are many details that are difficult to resolve, such as whether princes can serve as cabinet members, what should be the proportion of the princes' right to participate in politics, whether it should be through popular election or other methods, whether representatives of the princely states should occupy seats in both houses, and whether princes or their representatives, as members of the legislature, should have the right to speak on matters unrelated to them, and whether members of British India should have the right to interfere in the affairs of the princely states. These types of questions will require lengthy discussions. Regardless of the outcome of future discussions, the sudden difficulty in resolving such matters was not initially anticipated. There has also been little progress in resolving the Hindu-Muslim issue. Muslims are unwilling to have joint elections and do not want the number of Muslim representatives in the central legislature to be less than 33 percent. Indian liberals are currently holding informal talks with Muslim leaders in hopes of agreeing on a method. According to Reuters, the Indian princes have not yet put forward the conditions under which they would join the federation. American government and British representatives are now studying the federal problem. Liberal Party representatives met this morning, and Conservative Party representatives not only have close contact with their party leaders but are also contacting Indian princes and representatives of British India.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 24th - The Indian government's weekly report on the Indian situation stated that the attention attracted by the development of the federal system at the Indian Round Table Conference was not as great as expected, but it has inspired constructive thinking, hoping that the development of the Round Table Conference can gradually shift people's attention from purely destructive criticism. Now the importance of the Round Table Conference is gradually being recognized, and there is hope for success.</p>
<p>Soviet Representative</p>
<h3>Angrily Leaves Geneva</h3>
<p>Preparatory Committee on Disarmament Passes Italian Proposal</p>
<p>Meeting Between Italian and Russian Foreign Ministers Worthy of Attention</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 24th - After withdrawing from the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference, Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov arrived in Milan tonight and was warmly welcomed by local authorities. Italian Foreign Minister Grandi has also departed and will meet with Litvinov to continue previous talks on disarmament and other issues, hoping to reach full agreement between the Italian and Russian governments. It is reported that after meeting with Grandi, Litvinov will return to Moscow via Berlin. It is claimed here that Litvinov's visit to Milan is largely due to rumors in Geneva that the reason for his hasty departure from the conference was due to a serious revolution in Soviet Russia, so he came to Italy to dispel the rumors. In fact, Litvinov's departure from Geneva was purely due to dissatisfaction with the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference and is absolutely unrelated to internal affairs.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Milan, 24th - Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov and Italian Foreign Minister Grandi met for two hours today at the Italian Foreign Ministry. This event attracted much attention. After Litvinov returned to the hotel, Grandi visited him again. In the evening, Grandi hosted a banquet to entertain the Russian Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Geneva, 24th - Russian naval attaché Gikenskiy has followed the Russian representative Litvinov and left the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference to take up a position in Rome. Turkish Foreign Minister Rushdi also does not wish to remain in Geneva for the entire duration of the Disarmament Committee meeting and will soon go to Rome to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Today, when the Disarmament Committee discussed the exchange of information on armaments and troop numbers, it passed the Italian proposal by a vote of five to four. According to the proposal, the overseas forces of each country and organizations formed on a military basis must be listed in a separate section of the report. The Committee also passed a clause by a vote of seven to three, stipulating that the names and tonnage of all merchant ships that can be converted into warships must be notified to the League of Nations Secretariat. The Committee then passed the articles on the transfer of civil aircraft for military use in the Disarmament Convention. British representative Cecil and Italian representative Massigli both considered this provision extremely important, but German representative Poncet said that there has been no action on how to restrict and publicize the storage of military or aviation equipment, while only civil aviation is being discussed, which he found strange.</p>

<h3>German Cabinet Shows Signs of Shaking</h3>
<p>Economic Faction Suddenly Changes Stance to Support</p>
<p>Opposes Cooperation with Social Democrats</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 25th - The Brüning cabinet suddenly experienced a shake-up at noon today. The Economic Party, which holds 23 seats in the parliament, abruptly decided not to back Brüning's cabinet and instead sided with the opposition. As soon as this news was spread, Brüning met with the leaders of the party to explain the situation in various ways. Whether there is any hope of reversing the situation remains to be seen. Although the party did not state its reasons for taking this sudden action, it is speculated that the root cause is the recent talks between Brüning and the Social Democrats to join hands, as the party strongly opposes the cabinet cooperating with the Social Democrats.</p>
<h3>Polish Senate Re-election Completed, Pilsudski's Faction Achieves Great Victory</h3>
<p>Occupies More Than Half of the Entire Senate</p>
<p>Repeatedly Perpetrates Atrocities Against Ethnic Minorities</p>
<p>German Government Submits Strong Protest</p>
<p>National News Agency, Warsaw, 24th - The results of yesterday's re-election of the Polish Senate show that Pilsudski's faction achieved another great victory, occupying 76 of the 111 seats in the entire Senate. The remaining seats were won by the Left Group with 14 seats (31 in the previous session), the National Democratic Party with 12 seats (9 in the previous session), the Christian Democratic Party with 2 seats (6 in the previous session), the German Party with 3 seats (5 in the previous session), the Ukrainian Party with 4 seats (3 in the previous session), and the Jewish Party, which had 6 seats in the previous session, has none in this session. During yesterday's voting in Upper Silesia, six Polish Germans were beaten to death by Polish nationalist thugs while the police stood by and watched. In addition, dozens of others were abused by Poles.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 24th - Due to the repeated atrocities perpetrated by the Polish people and authorities against the German minority in that country, including the unprovoked beating to death of six election agents of the German Party at the polling station yesterday, the German government plans to submit a strong protest to the League of Nations. The German press unanimously welcomed this move. As for the Polish parade in Katowice, which hung a puppet dressed as a German military officer from a gallows and paraded it through the streets before throwing it into a raging fire, the German Foreign Ministry has instructed the German Consul-General in the area to lodge a strong protest with the Polish authorities. In addition, Prussian Prime Minister Braun, who is known for his stability and prudence, also gave a speech on the German-Polish issue at the University of Königsberg today, saying that the arbitrary demarcation of Germany's eastern border constantly makes Germans feel a prickle in their backs, and the protests will not stop. Germans will never recognize this border. Germany certainly does not want to deny the rights of the Polish nation, but when Poles exercise their rights, they must not infringe upon Germany and the German nation.</p>

<h3>Closer Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 24th - After staying in Berlin for three days, Hungarian Prime Minister Count Bethlen left today.

There was complete harmony in opinions, and relations between Hungary and Germany are extremely close.</p>
<p>Western European Storms Unabated</p>
<h3>Heavy Losses of Life and Property</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 24th - Since yesterday, strong winds and heavy rain have battered the North Sea and the English Channel, and have not yet subsided. The wind force has reached 150 miles per hour. The German cargo ship Louis was wrecked at the mouth of the Elbe River, and 31 people were drowned. Hundreds of ships have anchored in the harbors of Hamburg and the English Channel to take shelter from the storm. The area affected by the storm is vast, and transportation is mostly obstructed. The losses of life and property are still difficult to estimate. In addition, the sudden melting of snow and ice in the mountains has caused all rivers to rise sharply. The Rhine River has breached its banks in several places, and Berlin is in danger of flooding. Paris and The Hague have also reported flooding.</p>

<h3>Japanese Finance Minister Delivers Speech on Finance</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Osaka, 25th - Finance Minister Inoue delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the five western Japanese bankers in Osaka today, describing Japan's financial and economic situation. He said that the next budget will be particularly difficult to prepare due to reduced tax revenue, but he intends to avoid debt and strive for austerity, as well as improve government administration and the financial system, to balance the budget. As for Japan's economic situation, there have recently been various motivations to gradually stabilize domestic and foreign prices. Japan's securities market has seen a recovery, and copper and sugar prices overseas have both shown signs of improvement. All of these are good signs. The Finance Minister then spoke at length about the rationalization of Japanese industry and earnestly urged bankers to provide financial assistance to achieve this goal. The Finance Minister then mentioned Japan's international trade, saying that in light of the global recession and Japan's return to the gold standard, international trade is still fairly satisfactory, as imports far exceed exports this year. Since the lifting of the gold embargo, gold worth 308 million yen has been exported, but part of this was used to purchase Japanese gold bonds.</p>
<h3>Trial Opens in Korean Communist Case</h3>

<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 25th - The trial of Song Changlian and 29 others from the Korean Communist Party Japan General Bureau and the Korean Communist Youth League Headquarters, who sang of Korean independence, spread communism, and secretly engaged in activities, for violating the Public Security Preservation Law, opened for the first time this morning at the Tokyo District Court. Judge Kamigaki and Prosecutor Maru presided over the trial. Before the trial began, armed police officers were stationed in front of the courthouse, and those who looked suspicious were searched and more than ten people were taken away. The trial was originally scheduled to begin at nine o'clock, but was delayed until 11:25, with an atmosphere of unrest. As expected, the defendants refused to accept the judge's interrogation, sang revolutionary songs, and shouted "Long live the Korean Communist Party," causing great noise. The courtroom was chaotic, so five minutes after the trial began, it was announced that the trial would be closed to the public.</p>

<h3>International Fraud Case Discovered</h3>
<p>Company Violates Contract for Printing Banknotes</p>
<p>Portuguese Bank Sues in English Court</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 24th - The Portuguese Bank sued the Waterloo and Sons Printing Company in the English court for violating the contract to print Portuguese banknotes, seeking damages of £1,115,613. This case arose from a major fraud in which a con man stole bank notes worth £1 million from the printing company. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, an international con man named Marang forged a letter from the President of the Portuguese Bank in 1924, instructing Waterloo and Sons to print banknotes. Although this plot was cunning, there were many loopholes that not only aroused suspicion but also explicitly informed people of the suspicious points, but the company still supplied them in full, causing these banknotes to circulate abroad.</p>

<h3>Yan's Arrangements Before Leaving Shanxi</h3>
<p>Xu Yongchang to Oversee the Aftermath</p>
<p>Yan Xishan Lavishly Rewards Subordinates</p>
<p>Taiyuan dispatch: After the return of Wen Shouquan and Liang Ruzhou from Liaoning, Yan Xishan, considering the deteriorating environment, had already completed preparations in Wutai and decided to go abroad. It is expected that he will depart within the month. Yan is currently residing in Jian'an Village, where Feng Yuxiang previously resided last year. High-ranking military and political figures have been flocking to pay their respects. After Yan leaves the province, Xu Yongchang, under the title of Garrison Commander of Shanxi and Suiyuan, will temporarily be responsible for maintaining order in Shanxi in conjunction with Provincial Chairman Shang Zhen. Xu is scheduled to take office on the 18th. According to general observations, Xu's appointment is purely transitional, and the real solutions will await the decision of the central government. Fu Zuoyi has recently been appointed by Yan as the Garrison Commander of the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway and went to Datong to assume office yesterday. Feng Yuxiang's whereabouts are now rumored to be in Fenyang, and there are even rumors that Yan will go there to meet him, but it is not confirmed. To reward his subordinates before leaving the country, Yan withdrew seven million yuan in cash from the Provincial Bank. Military officers above the rank of brigade commander and civilian officials who were Yan's confidants were each given rewards ranging from five thousand to fifteen thousand yuan. According to internal sources from the Provincial Bank, when Yan returned to Taiyuan from Shizhuang, the bank still had more than 13 million yuan in cash. After Yan withdrew 7 million yuan, spent 2 to 3 million yuan on miscellaneous expenses and refunded 20% of the share capital, the bank now has only about 3 million yuan. According to official announcements, the total amount of banknotes issued by the Provincial Bank is 47.5 million yuan. After Yan leaves Shanxi, leaving behind only this worthless paper, the lives of the 13 million people in the province are uncertain. This is indeed a major problem currently facing Shanxi. Since Liang Ruzhou's return to Taiyuan, Yan's headquarters convened a meeting of all staff the day before yesterday, ordering the completion of all preparations within three days. The public meals provided there will be canceled tomorrow. In recent days, communist saboteurs have been repeatedly arrested in Taiyuan, and officials have implemented unusually strict security measures in the city. Curfews are enforced every night at 11:00 PM. Former provincial party members are still secretly plotting and actively engaging in activities. (November 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Garrison in Fengcheng, Liaoning, Kills Chinese Again</h3>
<p>Two Murders in Three Months</p>
<p>Shenyang dispatch: Another incident of the Japanese garrison killing Chinese has occurred in Fengcheng County, Liaoning Province. Previously, there was an incident where the Japanese garrison brutally killed Chinese, which was repeatedly protested but yielded no results. Now, there has been another shooting of Chinese. Initially, Liu Decai, a farmer from Xigou Village, Fengcheng, in his thirties, with a wife, Liu Wangshi, and children, was a hired worker at the home of Ai Shuquan in Aijiabaozi. On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, at 7:00 PM, Liu was returning home to get clothes when he encountered a Japanese garrison patrol by the railway. They immediately subjected him to inspection. There were no other people at the time. For some unknown reason, they stabbed Liu several times with bayonets. Liu screamed for help in extreme pain. Although nearby residents heard the cries, no one dared to help due to the usual intimidating power of the Japanese garrison. Finally, Liu was shot and killed by the Japanese garrison. The next day, Chen Fangxiang, the village chief of Xigou, reported it to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau. After verification by Branch Chief Ao Shizhang, the incident was reported to the county government. The county government sent personnel to the scene of the incident with the Japanese garrison for inspection. They found the deceased lying face up on the road, with blood stains blurred, a tragic sight. The inspection revealed one bayonet wound on the outside of the deceased's right arm, two bayonet wounds under the right armpit, one bayonet wound on the back, and one bullet wound on the left side of the ribs, proving that he was first stabbed with a knife and then shot to death. The deceased's wife, Liu Wangshi, and their two children cried loudly when they saw the scene, requesting the county government to seek justice for the deceased. The county government made a reasoned protest to the Japanese side. The Japanese garrison claimed that they were patrolling the area at 7:30 PM that night and saw Liu moving a large stone onto the tracks. They intended to arrest him, but Liu resisted with a wooden stick, causing accidental injury, etc. The county government said that regardless of whether the farmer had unlawful behavior, even if he did, how could a small wooden stick resist sharp firearms? Who can believe this situation? Later, the county government comforted the family of the deceased and temporarily buried the deceased, reporting the situation to the provincial government and instructing the Foreign Affairs Office to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese side. The Liaoning National Foreign Affairs Association was extremely indignant about this case, stating that there have been two cases of the Japanese garrison in Fengcheng shooting and killing Chinese within three months, treating the lives of our people like dirt, with extreme animosity. How can our people rest easy? The association is now appealing to the authorities to seek justice for the deceased. (November 21st)</p>

<h3>Hunan Province Mobilizes for Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>He Jian Exhorts His Troops to Strive to Suppress the Communists</p>
<p>Changsha dispatch: Hunan Province has recently implemented bandit suppression, but the bandit forces have not yet been quelled. For example, the scattered bandits in Nanhua have not been cleared, the siege of Jinfeng has been lifted, but He Long and Kuang Jixun have captured Cishi, advancing towards Changtao. This is the situation in western Hunan. Pingjiang and Liuyang counties have fallen entirely into red influence. Communist leaders Kong Helong, Hu Jun, Zhang Jingwu, and others have been entrenched in Pingjiang and Liuyang for more than a month, engaging in dozens of battles with government forces, and the bandit forces remain the same. Kong's bandits even broke out of Pingjiang, Changle, and Xinshi, rushing into Miluo, destroying the railway, cutting off transportation between Hunan and Hubei, and this has happened twice. Each time, it took several days or more than ten days of effort to repel them. At present, the county seat of Pingjiang is still in the hands of the bandits. Although the county seat of Liuyang is in the hands of the government forces, the communist forces are in all rural areas and still need to be cleared. This is the situation in Pingjiang and Liuyang. Anren and Chaling counties have been captured twice in a month by Chen Shao's bandit troops, and all the militia guns have been confiscated. A few days ago, Duan Heng, the commander of the Southern Hunan Garrison, led his troops to recover them, but Chen's bandits are still entrenched in Lianhua, Jiangxi, and there is a possibility of frequent incursions. In addition, the communists in Ji'an are also threatening to flee to Chaling. The people of eastern Hunan are fleeing to the province one after another. Seeing this situation, He Jian knows that nothing can be done without a painful suppression, so he assembled his troops and concentrated them in separate ways, completing the concentration before the 19th of this month, and launching a general attack in separate ways at the same time on the morning of the 20th. The plan and troop allocation are as follows: (1) In western Hunan, Ma Kunshan's division of the Sichuan Army, totaling three regiments, will suppress Jinfeng and clear the scattered bandits. Zhang Ying's division of the Sichuan Army, totaling three regiments, and Cheng Tiexia's brigade of the 16th Hunan Army, totaling two regiments, will clear the scattered bandits in Nanhua. In addition, Chen Quzhen's six regiments of the First Garrison Command and Dai Huiheng's three regiments of the Western Hunan Bandit Suppression Command will be the pursuit troops, surrounding Cishi and pursuing He and Kuang's bandits. (2) In Pingjiang and Liuyang, Tao Guang's 31st Division, totaling four regiments, Wang Dongyuan's 15th Division, totaling six regiments, and Zhu Xingyu's Bandit Suppression Second Battalion, totaling eleven regiments, will attack the county seat of Pingjiang, and send Liu Jianxu, the commander of the 28th Army, to supervise the battle in Zhushayu Qianzhan, first clearing Pingjiang, and then pursuing Jiangxi Tonggu and Xiushui. Liuyang will be cleared by Chen Guangzhong's Fourth Regiment of the Independent Seventh Brigade, Bai Shinuo's One Regiment of the Security Corps, and the West Liuyang Volunteer Team, searching and advancing towards Gugang Dongmen City, first clearing Liuyang, and then pursuing Jiangxi Wanzai. In addition, Tong Kun's two regiments of the Second Bandit Suppression Brigade in western Hunan, Guo Bugao's One Battalion of the First Bandit Suppression Battalion, and Ye Wenke's Independent Regiment of the General Headquarters will be deployed between Yuezhou and Xiangyin Miluo to protect the road and prevent the communist bandits in Pingjiang from rushing out to destroy the road, and Gu Weiren, the commander of the 16th Division, will be stationed in Miluo to command. (3) In eastern Hunan, Duan Heng's two regiments of the Southern Hunan Garrison Command and Li Jue's four regiments of the 19th Division will search and advance towards Lianhua Fenyi from Chaling. The above-mentioned mobilization force totaled 43 regiments, approximately 56,000 people, who were all dispatched at the same time on the 20th to suppress the bandits in separate ways. On the evening of the 20th, Army Commander Liu Jianxu sent a telegram from the front line of Zhushayu, saying that Wang Dongyuan attacked Pingcheng from Daqiaoyu Sanyangjie Lusu Mountain at dawn, Tao Guang's division attacked Pingcheng from Sanjiaotang Chengtan, and Zhu Xingyu's battalion attacked Pingcheng from Jinjiashi Tianyue Mountain. Nearly 10,000 bandits stubbornly resisted, holding out until 4:00 PM. Tao Guang's Zhong Guangren Brigade broke through the bandit troops and broke into Pingcheng, killing many bandits. He was following Tao's division to advance towards Pingcheng, and most of the bandits fled to Nanjiang. Also, Brigade Commander Chen Guangzhong telegraphed that the bandit nest in Shihuhas been broken, killing more than 100 bandits and capturing 20 alive, and is now pursuing Mianchong. There has been progress in Pingjiang and Liuyang. The situation in other areas has not yet been reported. Before the mobilization, in order to boost morale, He Jian specially requested Commander-in-Chief Chiang to promote Chen Guangzhong, who was effective in suppressing bandits, to the commander of the 32nd Division, Dai Huiheng to the commander of the Independent Seventh Brigade, Li Muming (originally the chief of staff and second brigade commander of Chen Guangzhong's division) to the commander of the Independent Eighth Brigade, and Tong Kun to the commander of the Independent Ninth Brigade. He also sent a telegram to all his officers and men, earnestly exhorting them to strive to suppress the communists. The text of the telegram is as follows: "It has been found that the communist bandits led by Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, He, Kuang, Kong, and Li have been harming the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi for several years, killing and setting fires, doing everything. To sum up their crimes, it is heartbreaking. Previously, they have been repeatedly suppressed, but the bandits are cunning and evasive, and have not been wiped out. Now our army has been ordered to cooperate with the friendly armies of the three provinces to suppress the bandits. All the deployment of troops and pursuit plans have been issued for compliance. This suppression of bandits is directly to relieve the people of their suffering, and indirectly to lay the foundation of the party and the country on a solid foundation. It is especially important to the military prestige and reputation of our army. Now that the communist bandits are no longer as concentrated as before, and we have made sufficient preparations, the outcome of the victory or defeat is certain. If we still miss the opportunity and do not make a permanent plan, then the opportunity will be lost and the disaster will be great in the future, and the future will be uncertain, and we will not know where to die. Our officers and soldiers have always been loyal to the party and the country and have made meritorious service. We hope to inspire our conscience and strive to kill the thieves. We should all have the determination that if there are communists, there will be no us, and if there is us, there will be no communists. We should fight the bandits immediately without hesitation. In particular, we should not stand in a passive position, but should seek out the main force of the bandits, track and painfully suppress them, and destroy them all in one fell swoop. As for punishing those who follow the bandits and capturing the bandit masses, indiscriminate killing is useless, and indulgence is also impossible. It is important to use heavy punishment to govern the chaos. It is hoped that the army commanders and commanders will understand this purpose. All the security in the rear has been planned, so there is no need to worry. The responsibility belongs to you, so don't worry about it. There will be generous rewards for meritorious service in killing thieves, and those who are ineffective in battle will be punished according to the law. We hope that we will all work together. This is the most important thing." (November 21st)</p>

<h3>Four-Way Vehicle Clearing Meeting</h3>
<p>Xuzhou dispatch: The four-way vehicle clearing meeting of the Jinpu, Jiaoji, Longhai, and Pinghan railways was held at the Xuzhou Garden Hotel on the 17th of this month. The representatives of each road attended the meeting. The Jinpu Railway representatives were She Xu, Zhang Fan, Zhong Guidan, Zhao Keng, and Cheng Gui; the Jiaoji Railway representatives were Su Bubin, Yang Heng, Cao Yi, and Cao Changqi; the Longhai Railway representatives were Xiao Xinwu and Xu Zhongwei; the Pinghan Railway representative was Jin Yuanxun; and the Transportation Headquarters representative was Huang Xuezhou. The Ministry of Railways sent three staff members, Xu Chuanyin, Li Yue, and Tang Dehua. Qian Zongze, the commander of the transportation, presided over the meeting and reported on the military transportation operations of the Ministry of Transportation from its establishment on the 23rd to its dissolution on November 15th, the inter-transfer of vehicles, and the efforts to maintain them. Among them, the Jinpu and Longhai railways had the most vehicles crossing each other's tracks, and the Jiaoji and Pinghan railways had fewer. Therefore, the clearing was mainly focused on the Jinpu and Longhai railways, which were more complicated. The Jiaoji and Pinghan railways had less to do with it. After the report, Xu Chuanyin, the staff member of the Ministry of Railways, continued to preside over the meeting. The most important issue to be resolved in the morning meeting was to clear the vehicles crossing the tracks. It was agreed that Ni Peizhi would be sent by the Jinpu Railway, Zhang Hongyan by the Longhai Railway, Cao Yi by the Jiaoji Railway, and He Rongdi by the Pinghan Railway to be responsible for investigating the vehicle numbers for clearing. The standard for clearing was also determined, based on the signatures of the stationmasters on both sides of the track. All vehicles that crossed the tracks during the military transportation period and were not returned would be returned unconditionally. For those that exceeded the military period, they would be returned according to tonnage. According to the recent investigation results, the Jiaoji Railway had approximately 100 vehicles stranded on other routes, which need to be calculated with the Jinpu Railway in Jinan. The Pinghan Railway was barely able to cope, and the entire route had not been unified, so it was difficult to clear for the time being. The clearing situation of the Jinpu and Longhai railways: during the military period, the Longhai Railway delivered 529 passenger cars and 1,440 freight cars to the Jinpu Railway, totaling 369,467 tons. The Jinpu Railway delivered 484 passenger cars and 14,373 freight cars to the Longhai Railway, totaling 368,702 tons. The difference between the two is 45 passenger cars, 34 freight cars, totaling 765 tons. The clearing is roughly like this, but the opinions on the clearing plan of each route do not seem to be consistent. She Xu, the representative of the Jinpu Railway, has already returned to Pukou yesterday to report and ask for instructions. Therefore, the meeting has not been able to completely solve the clearing of vehicles. (November 24th)</p>

Seven men and women, including Fa Lingyuanxiang, were kidnapped, and a ransom of 200,000 yuan was demanded. Recently, the detective team leader of the Public Security Bureau, Xue Furi, and the third squad leader of the sixth team of the second district of the Waterborne Provincial Public Security Team, Ji Daiyang, led their teams to Shanghai to work with detectives from the French Concession police. They arrested five bandits at the Huidong Hotel, including Liu Fusheng, Guo Ru, Du Jinshan, and Yang Henglai, as well as four female accomplices, who are being temporarily held by the Water Police First District. The other day, squad leader Ji arrested Lu Jugen (a nephew of the Ling family), an informant in the case, on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession of Shanghai. Lu confessed to the kidnapping and revealed the location where his accomplices were hiding. Squad leader Ji, along with detectives from the French Concession Police Department, including Chief Mao Jingen, apprehended Nai A'da at the Shenjiang Hotel. They further apprehended a female accomplice, Xie Luo, at a certain hotel. This woman confessed that the leader of the gang was in the home of Cavalry Captain Ma in the French Concession, 42 Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre (Ma Changchen, formerly an inspector of the Second Smuggling Suppression Camp in Zhejiang). Based on the confession, Squad Leader Ji immediately went to the address and apprehended the two bandit leaders, Ma Liangchen and Zhang Huansheng, seizing a great deal of evidence. They were immediately detained at the French Concession Police Department. Yesterday afternoon, Squad Leader Ji returned to Wuxi by car to report to District Chief Mao, carrying documents to Shanghai to escort the fourteen bandits arrested so far back to Wuxi for interrogation and legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Tragic Vendetta Case Occurs at Haizhekou</p>
<p>At Haizhekou, west of Wuyi City, four men, Liu Dexi, Liu Zhanen, Lü Dejun, and Lü Fengdong, suddenly arrived at the Juchang and Changmaosheng lumber yards on the evening of the 23rd. They fired a shot first and then entered the Juchang lumber yard. There, they stabbed the night watchman, Chen Zhaoqi, in the throat and waist, causing him to bleed from the kidneys and fall supine on the ground. They then went to the Changmaosheng lumber yard and stabbed the night watchman, Kang Youli, in the head and throat, causing him to immediately fall to the ground and die. Kang Youlin and Yu Shan were also stabbed and injured. The next morning, the incident was reported to the nearby Public Security First Branch and Second Substation, which sent officers to investigate and confirmed the facts. In addition to the injured being taken to Wujin Hospital for treatment by the people in charge, Patrol Officer Xu Chizhi also prepared a document to be submitted to the Public Security Bureau to cooperate in arresting the perpetrators and bringing them to justice. Furthermore, according to news this (25th) morning, the injured Chen Zhaoqi has died from his injuries at Wujin Hospital.</p>

<p>Another Kidnapping Case Occurs in Xiyang Town</p>
<p>Six people, including Zhang Chengqi, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in Xiyang Town, Fushan District of this county, were kidnapped by bandits last month and are still missing. Unexpectedly, the other night (the 22nd) around 10 p.m., over fifty pirates, traveling in five civilian boats, arrived in the town. Each carried weapons. When they first arrived at the port, there happened to be an anti-smuggling patrol boat docked there. The pirates immediately surrounded the patrol boat. The police, outnumbered, had all their firearms seized, including one rifle, two Mauser pistols, and one carbine. After seizing the weapons, they rushed into the home of Bang Youchong and looted it, stealing over a hundred silver dollars and jewelry. Before leaving, they kidnapped You Heng's son, Tian Chen, his sister-in-law, Zhu, and his niece, Gui Jian. They then went to the home of Wang Bosheng in the same neighborhood and kidnapped his son, Gui, and his niece, Zhao Mei. It is said that Zhou Youheng was previously kidnapped by bandits and paid a ransom of 30,000 yuan to secure his release. He had barely escaped danger when his son was kidnapped again. It is said that his suffering is unbearable.</p>

<p>Money Industry Sends Representatives to Shanghai to Arrange for Accounting Period</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang business community feels inconvenienced by the initial adoption of the Gregorian calendar for settling accounts this year. The Chamber of Commerce and the Money Industry Association have discussed this repeatedly. They agree that Shanghai is the commercial center of the country and that they must follow its lead and proceed step by step, slightly modifying their practices when necessary. Yesterday, the Money Industry Association publicly appointed Hu Jingxuan and Sheng Pengji to travel to Shanghai immediately, carrying official letters, to directly consult with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for solutions.</p>
<p>Ding Fengxiang Silk Mill Closes Again Yesterday</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang Ding Fengxiang Silk Mill, currently managed by Miao Shaoqing, a cocoon merchant from Wuxi, and renamed Yingyu Company, resumed operations the other day (the 23rd). Unexpectedly, after only one day of operation, it announced another shutdown yesterday (the 24th). The reason is said to be that when the mill was reopened, it only had fifteen bales of silk cocoons transported from Wuxi. The remaining cocoons were to be transported to Zhenjiang after operations resumed. Unexpectedly, the cocoons were detained at the Wuxi station by a group of female workers in Wuxi, making it impossible to continue operations. Mr. Miao, upon hearing this news, went to Wuxi to negotiate with them.</p>

<p>Education Bureau Chief Trapped</p>
<p>The Education Bureau of Yangzhong County has six or seven hundred acres of school land located in Beisha, which belongs to Taixing County. However, it is all along the river embankment, and the tidal flats are unstable. Since Feng Zidan, a sand bully from that area, reported claiming over two hundred acres to the Taixing Sand Field Bureau, the boundary lines have been unclear, leading to lawsuits since the 15th year of the Republic. Although there has been a land survey, the Taixing side has not thoroughly resolved the issue, allowing the dispute to continue, resulting in a pending case. Now that the time for cutting reeds is approaching, the Yangzhong County Education Bureau specifically requested and was approved by County Magistrate Xu to issue a joint public notice with County Magistrate Ma of Taixing, prohibiting cutting until the matter is resolved. This public notice was taken by Wang Huankun, the Director of the Education Bureau of Yangzhong, to be posted. Unexpectedly, Feng Zidan's side had already received the news. When Director Wang arrived at the sandbar, they immediately summoned over a hundred people to prevent the posting and trapped Director Wang, demanding and threatening him, while they themselves cut the reeds. Fortunately, a carter returned to the bureau to report. Upon receiving the news, the Education Bureau reported to the 21st Squad of the Fifth District of the Water Police, requesting them to send police to suppress the situation and seal off the cut reeds. It is expected that Director Wang will be able to escape danger and return to the bureau within a few days.</p>
<p>Suddenly Arrested While Attending a Wedding</p>
<p>Yao De Gui, a villager residing in Yaojia Tan Village behind Xinglong Town, was previously arrested for a kidnapping case. After being released, he returned to farming. On the 22nd of this month, there was a wedding in a neighboring village, and De Gui went to offer congratulations and help. Unexpectedly, while he was enjoying the wedding banquet, he was suddenly arrested by a bailiff from the county government. He was bound with hemp rope and taken to Sanmao Town, escorted to the county government, and taken into custody. All those attending the wedding banquet were baffled. It is said that the reason for the arrest was due to the villager's previous appeal to the provincial government after being released, but it is not known for certain.</p>

<p>A Singular Fire Accident</p>
<p>Outside the East Gate of Huaiyin County, there used to be one large and one small City God Temple. The large City God Temple was south of the Grand Canal, and the small City God Temple was north of the canal. Every year on the tenth day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar, superstitious men and women would go to the temples to burn incense. The burning of incense was more popular than in any other temple in the county. Yesterday, on the tenth day of the tenth lunar month, superstitious men and women from various places again went to burn incense and pray for blessings. Unexpectedly, the monks in both temples disregarded the ban and did not dare to openly come out to greet the worshippers, resulting in fires in both temples. The losses were especially heavy in the large City God Temple, with one main hall and several wooden puppets burned down. The cause of the fires was the unextinguished incense candles, which is quite strange.</p>
<p>Wei San's Bandit Gang Flees to Anhui</p>
<p>Wei San's bandit gang, which had been entrenched in the Jinjia and Caojia Temple area in the western countryside of Siyang, had seven or eight hundred followers. Since last winter, for nearly a year, this gang of bandits has roamed around, robbing, looting, burning, and killing, without restraint. The people of Siyang were most pained by this. Since the Jiangsu Provincial Waterborne Public Security Team arrived in Siyang last month, they have joined forces with the county police and militia to strike hard, causing Wei San's gang to suffer many casualties. Moreover, they have also split into several smaller groups and no longer dare to confront the government troops. According to people from Siyang who came to Pu, the various small groups of bandits that have split off have completely retreated to Suxian and other places in northern Anhui, no longer remaining in western Siyang. As a result, the Xia Lingyun unit, the Second Battalion of the 266th Regiment, which had previously been dispatched to Siyang, also returned to Puyuan this afternoon (the 22nd) for rest.</p>

<p>Bandit News in Yaqian Township</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, the family of Miao Wuxiang in Jiuyafang, west of Yaqian District, received a threatening letter from bandits demanding 2,000 silver dollars. Miao ignored it. The bandits came repeatedly to demand payment, but Wuxiang avoided meeting them. On the 17th, six bandits returned to his home, carrying bundles of firewood and piling them around the house, claiming that if he did not pay, they would burn the house down on the spot. Wuxiang had no choice but to ask the laity monk to negotiate, agreeing to pay 500 silver dollars to settle the matter.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Case in Beifang Port</p>
<p>At 11:00 p.m. on the night of the 21st, the home of Gu Liuxiang in Beifang Port, east of town, was robbed. Clothes, silver dollars, and rice were all looted. The bandits kidnapped two of Liuxiang's sons, both young and old. The Gu family was robbed once during the summer. This time, they suffered another looting, and their two sons were kidnapped, which can be described as a double misfortune.</p>

<p>Preparing to Abolish Likin and Investigate Businesses</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance believes that the central government is actively moving towards the abolition of likin, and Jiangsu Province has already implemented business tax. Zhejiang Province should not delay preparations for business tax. However, the business conditions in this province vary between eastern and western Zhejiang, making it difficult to unify. The tax rates should not be divided and other issues. Therefore, it has started formulating various business condition survey forms yesterday in order to dispatch personnel to investigate everything immediately.</p>
<p>Increasing Funds for Second and Third Class Counties</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, based on a proposal by Cheng Zhenjun, the acting head of the Department of Civil Affairs, plans to complete the organization law of all counties in the province in the 19th year of the Republic. In addition to the fourteen counties that have already been reorganized, the others should be organized according to laws and regulations to achieve completion. During the budget meeting, the administrative expenses of second and third class counties will be increased by 200 yuan each to facilitate the process. The department has now set December 1st as the implementation date.</p>

<p>Prohibiting Farmers' Associations from Privately Collecting Land Tax</p>
<p>In Xiaoshan, Xizhou, Konghu, and other villages, some illegal farmers, such as Zhang Huanying, have been privately collecting land tax of 30 or 35 cents per mu. If there is no money, it is replaced with items. It is found that there are more than 3,000 mu of land contracts in each village, totaling 18,000 mu in six villages. Collecting a tax of 35 cents is a considerable amount. Both tenants and landlords are being exploited. Citizens such as Shi Fengyi have petitioned the county to request a public notice strictly prohibiting farmers' associations from illegally collecting taxes. County Magistrate Du issued a strict prohibition after receiving the petition. Anyone who commits such acts in the future will be severely investigated according to the law.</p>
<p>Letter Received</p>
<h3>Letter from Cui Siping, Chief of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau of Jiangyin County</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I recently read an item in the Local News column of your newspaper (24th) stating that a hawker from Jiangyin was detained and fined by our branch and then released, which does not correspond with the facts. According to our records, on the evening of the 19th of this month, our bureau learned that gambling was taking place at the Ge residence in Hexi. The bureau chief immediately led police to arrest the gamblers, capturing four people, including Ge Laosi and others. Upon investigation, it was a small mahjong game, so they were sentenced to ten days detention each in accordance with Article 45 of the Law on Punishment of Violations of Police Regulations to serve as a warning. No fines were imposed afterwards. These are the established facts. Furthermore, the county government and the Public Security Bureau of this county have not revoked the investigation. It seems that your reporter stationed in Cheng County heard an inaccurate rumor. I am specially informing you of the detailed and accurate situation and request that you make a correction to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Cui Siping, Chief of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau of Jiangyin County, November 24th.</p>

<h3>A Strange Disease</h3>
<p>— Gong Yu</p>
<p>The world is vast and full of wonders. Everything imaginable, no matter how bizarre, exists in the world. Sometimes it even exceeds imagination. Therefore, although the Journey to the West is a Taoist book filled with allegories, since it is imaginable, why shouldn't there be such a powerful stone monkey in the world? Here is a record of a strange disease that is beyond human imagination and yet actually exists. The patient is an eighty-year-old woman, surnamed Xu. Her husband is still alive. Her son is named Sheng Bao. She lives in Xizhuang, north of Xitang City in Changshu. Initially, the old woman had been ill for nearly ten years, lying on her bed, and no medicine was effective. Her husband and son both thought that she was old and had no hope of recovery, so it was useless to waste money on medicine. Unexpectedly, this year, the old woman suddenly recovered and walked as usual, without any signs of senility. The whole family was delighted. When they saw that the old woman was no longer ill but had regained her vitality, her spirit and physique were actually healthier than those of a strong woman, able to climb on beams and roofs, agile beyond comparison, as if she possessed the art of qinggong (light body technique), so they were greatly surprised. She had lost a common illness only to suffer a very unusual one. Since the old woman suffered from this strange disease, her words and actions have been abnormal. The strangest thing is that the old woman constantly shouts, "I want to eat liver!" Sometimes she says "beef liver" or "lamb liver." Although her family considers it delirium, they observe that her condition seems to be that of someone extremely hungry and asking for food, not just senseless babbling. When given ordinary food, she refuses to accept it, shouting to eat liver without end. Soon after, some families nearby had cattle and sheep die of illness. When they were skinned and butchered, their livers were all missing. They couldn't help but exclaim in amazement, believing that the beef and lamb livers were actually eaten by the old woman. But the old woman never goes out, so what method does she use to obtain the beef and lamb livers? Or is it just a coincidence of delirium? This matter spread far and wide. Timid neighbors were worried that the old woman could kill people, and repeatedly warned the old woman's husband and son, advising them to kill the old woman to eliminate the harm to the community. The husband and son were also very frightened, but they hesitated to carry out the deadly act that was recommended by their neighbors. It wasn’t long before the neighbors' imagined fears were realized. A woman surnamed Mou had been bedridden for months. Medicine was ineffective, and her condition worsened over time until she could not get up. The night before, when the woman was in a coma, she suddenly screamed, "Old woman Xu is here! She is eating my liver on the bed! It hurts!" Her voice was shrill, and her face changed with the sound. Her family was terrified and gathered around the bed, holding lamps and illuminating everything. At first, there were no traces of anything, but the sick woman continued to cry out in pain. They quickly summoned a doctor. After examining her for a while, he said, "It's just delirium, caused by evil entering the pericardium." Her family had long heard of the strangeness of old woman Xu and did not believe the doctor's words. So after the woman died, they went to the Xu family to argue. However, since the matter was bizarre and there was no real evidence, they could not say that the woman was killed by the old woman. After Lu Lian persuaded them, they gave up. However, the fearful hearts of the neighbors were even more intense because of this. They discussed putting the old woman to death. The old woman's son, Sheng Bao, had already expressed his agreement, but her husband insisted on opposing it. The group's discussion was then dropped. Now the old woman is confined in her room by her husband, forbidden to take a single step. And so nothing unusual has happened. But her abnormal words and actions are still the same as before. In the heat of summer, the old woman sleeps soundly wrapped in quilts, unaware of the heat. No one knows what disease she has.</p>
<h3>Announcement of Goldfish Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Suzhou Park, in order to meet the needs of the times and develop public undertakings, holds a recreational gathering once a month. The recreational guidelines are based on openness and interest. Last month, there was a chrysanthemum exhibition, which was one such event. Goldfish are products that cultivate sentiment and temperament and are loved by most people. It is even more indispensable to use them to decorate gardens, ponds, and pools. However, this creature is not easy to raise. Without specialized experience, it is difficult to hope for its long-term survival, which is even more difficult than cultivating flowers and plants. The park originally had more than ten varieties of goldfish, and employed a fish farmer to raise them, which has long been the focus of attention of visitors. Now there is also the creation of this fair, which is also an unprecedented event. It is said that the park is currently entrusting people to widely collect fine varieties from the Shanghai and Huzhou areas, and many goldfish gardens in the Suzhou area are also happy to join.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>After Watching "Robin Hood"  A few days ago, I was invited by Mr. Xu of the Carlton to watch the preview of the colorful blockbuster "Robin Hood". Afterwards, Mr. Xu asked me to write an article to praise it. What I want to say is that the brilliance of this film is concentrated in the male lead, Lawrence Tibbett. The greatness of this film is also the greatness of Tibbett himself. Tibbett is not only the pride of the greenwoods, but also the darling of heaven. Tibbett is the most robust and heroic man among men, unparalleled in the world. Tibbett's singing voice, its grandeur and depth, should only be rivaled by the song saint Caruso. As for the magnificence of his physique, it can be seen when he is flogged. He is truly the most beautiful and robust man in the world. Who can compare to him? It is fitting to call him the pride of the greenwoods, and why not the darling of heaven? If anyone still has doubts about this, those doubts can be dispelled after watching Tibbett in this film. Tibbett was originally a famous baritone in the New York Metropolitan Opera Company. This time, he was unexpectedly recruited by Metro Pictures, and he was able to use the introduction of sound film to transfer his divinely bestowed magnificent singing voice to the silver screen. Our desire for auditory and visual pleasure is satisfied, how can we not rejoice? As for the exquisite arrangement of the entire colorful film, etc., these are all minor matters and need not be mentioned. (Jin Xu)</p>
<p>After Watching the Preview of "A Woman of Affairs"  The world's morals are declining, and lust is rampant. Observe the young men and women of recent years. Whenever love is mentioned, they are delighted and excited. This is truly regrettable. After I watched the film "A Woman of Affairs," I felt even more deeply about this. The film stars John Gilbert and tells the story of a纨绔子弟 who relies on his wicked money and seductive skills to act capriciously, only knowing how to toy with women. He even thinks of seducing his friend's fiancée. One wrong thought leads to all kinds of tragedies. The discarded old flame commits suicide because of it, and the lover's husband also loses his life because of this. Although he is able to realize his mistakes and repent in the end, the stain on his conscience can never be erased. This is a rough sketch of the film's plot, truly a photographic depiction of a wicked society. John Gilbert has always been known for his skill in playing romantic roles. Anyone who has seen "Flesh and the Devil" and "Love" has a considerable understanding of his artistry. In "A Woman of Affairs," his performance is even more profound, and his demeanor is even more unrestrained than before. His romantic warmth in his dissolute times is intoxicating, and his melancholy and anger during his repentance are also enough to move people deeply. From beginning to end, his performance is impeccable. It is said that the film has already been released to the public at the Paris Grand Theatre. (Ban Yun)</p>
<h3>Record of a Strange Snake</h3>
<p>— Junshuo</p>
<p>A guest, Gu Mengxian, from Shaoxing, recounted that when he was young, he drank at his relative Yan Qi's home at an elegant gathering to admire orchids. A certain official in the county, recently returned from Shanxi, brought Fenjiu, and ordered his servant to bring it out to entertain his friends. The color was oily and emerald green, called Bamboo Leaf Green. The guests all agreed that using fine wine to appreciate famous flowers made this gathering truly worthwhile. A guest, Mr. Zhang, said, "Bamboo Leaf Green is originally an ancient name, and this wine is very fitting. However, there is also a venomous snake also named Bamboo Leaf Green. I heard from the elders that there was a farmer in my hometown who farmed in the mountain fields, constantly going in and out of the mountains. In the mountains, there was a small snake, no more than two inches long, with a pure green color. Its venom was even more potent than that of a viper. It was said to be a Bamboo Leaf Green. People avoided it. One day, after the rain had cleared, the farmer had something to do in the mountains and wore nailed boots. As he passed through the thick grass, he saw a giant python, more than ten feet long, rolling on the ground, as if in pain. Upon closer inspection, he saw that there was a Bamboo Leaf Green on the head of the giant python. The farmer thought to save the python and quickly lifted his foot to kick it away. The farmer was not unaware of the extreme venom of the Bamboo Leaf Green. He thought that the bottom of his nailed boots had several layers of leather and was lined with iron nails, so there should be no harm. After kicking the Bamboo Leaf Green to the ground, he trampled it to death. The giant python then leisurely departed. When the farmer returned home, his foot was swollen and painful. Before long, the swelling had reached his abdomen. His family asked and learned that it was caused by kicking the Bamboo Leaf Green. They were alarmed and at a loss. As it was getting dark, they suddenly saw a giant python enter through the window, holding several leaves of green grass in its mouth and placing them on the ground. The family was shocked to see the python and turned to flee, but the giant python had already left. The farmer said, 'That was the python from before. It must have brought antidote grass to save me.' He then decocted the grass and drank it. The pain quickly subsided, and he washed his foot with it. By midnight, it had returned to normal, and he was unharmed. Upon examining the shape of the grass, he could not find it again in the mountains. Some say that it probably grows in deep valleys that cannot be reached by human footprints." After Mr. Zhang finished speaking, each of the guests drank a cup and said, "This Bamboo Leaf Green is not like that Bamboo Leaf Green; it can be taken into the stomach." Mengxian said that Mr. Zhang was also from Shaoxing.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Southeast Asia (83)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the 31st, I went from the market to the post office. The postal service here falls under the jurisdiction of the Indian government. One shield is equivalent to 1.3 yuan in our currency. I bought stamps for sixteen annas. One anna can send a letter to this port, two annas can send a letter to the British Straits Settlements, and three annas can send a letter to England and Shanghai. There are many women in the market. They wear their hair high and are pleased with their beautiful makeup, comparable to Chinese women. The status of Burmese women is higher than in other places. They are all literate and educated. They guide men. It is said that Burma is the country in the world where people are most afraid of their wives. There are only female staff in the government offices, but their method of applying powder is too crude, to the point of applying it like actors.</p>
<p>I have gained a new observation on the clothing of Burmese men and women, that is, the Burmese have completely become matriarchal and feminized. Burmese men also wear green skirts, with little difference from women, and the same goes for the upper body. They wear all kinds of colorful clothes, so from a distance, there is no difference between men's and women's clothing. What's even stranger is that Burmese men wear flat-topped hats, which look no different from women's high buns. From this, we know that men's clothing, from head to toe, is all learned from their mothers.</p>
<p>There are many Chinese men here who marry Burmese women, and many of the children born abroad have Burmese mothers. However, it is said that Chinese often return home halfway and abandon their wives. Burmese women deeply hate the unconscionability of the Chinese and dare not approach them easily.</p>
<p>On July 1st, Dharma Master Wan invited me to eat at a restaurant. The dishes were very expensive, each dish costing at least one and a half shields, making life more expensive than in Singapore and Penang. In Singapore, I saw 吉能 people (Indian laborers) grabbing rice and vegetables with their hands to eat, which I found very strange. I often ate their pancakes, which were very delicious, at the 吉能 restaurants. They always took the food into their mouths with their hands and washed their hands with water after eating. We found it inconvenient, so they specially provided Western-style knives and forks for the Chinese to use. But in Burma, those restaurants don't often have knives and forks. Everyone grabs the food with their hands, which we find very inconvenient. But those who have been in Southeast Asia for a long time have also adapted to it. Walking on the street, everyone eats outdoors. There was a young Western woman, probably in her twenties, dressed in beautiful clothes, eating oil and meat dishes with her right hand, just like a Burmese woman. I wanted to laugh but didn't dare to. I just recited Ban Gu's "Eastern Capital Rhapsody" and sighed, "How painful it is that customs change people!"</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (322)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Cui Xiu Diligently Asks for Characters from the Teacher, Heroic Soldiers Talk Boldly at a Brothel Banquet for Heroines</p>
<p>Let's say that ever since Zuo Shichen met Lvyi at the Yuebin Restaurant, it was as if he had been bewitched again. Adding to this the encouragement from friends, they arranged to eat dinner together every day. You invite me, I invite you, and so on, in a continuous chain. Each time they ate dinner, they felt it was too boring without any women present, so the two had more opportunities to get close. Many organizations in Shanghai are now moving towards Europeanization and do not provide meals and accommodation. People who work in companies and banks during the day often travel a long way home to eat. Some also organize their own places to eat. After five o'clock in the evening, some firms leave one or two employees to watch over, while others simply hand over the door to the "iron general" (lock). They don't care about anything else. After the employees leave, they are finally free to relax. Editors in newspaper offices are exactly the opposite of those people. The time when those people finish work is the time when they start work. Therefore, those editors in newspaper offices, along with the patrolling policemen who keep watch on the streets at night, the female workers who work the night shift in silk factories, and the pig slaughterers in the slaughterhouses, are all nocturnal animals. Sometimes, they work until dawn and go home to eat some porridge and snacks. It's already broad daylight. The next day, they sleep until after lunch. They get up, wash up, eat, and then look at the newspaper they edited to see if there are any problems. After blinking their eyes, the sun sets again. It's time to work again. Dinner time is considered a brief respite where they can relax and enjoy themselves. The first batch of news has already been sent out. The newspapers need to be typeset and won't be on the market until after twelve o'clock. Although the newspaper office also prepares dinner, several senior staff members are unwilling to eat dinner in the newspaper office. There's a reason for this. Because the newspaper office at that time was cramped. The typesetting room and machine room were already very crowded. There was no room for a kitchen. Since there was no kitchen, they had to eat packaged meals. Those packaged meals were really hard to swallow. First of all, just looking at them made one feel that they were unsanitary. In the summer, it's even worse. Flies often looked like black rice and were found in the food. People who suffered from cholera vomiting and diarrhea always suspected that there was something wrong with the packaged meals. In the winter, people always want to eat some warm soup and hot rice. However, after the packaged meals were delivered there, or if there was a delay, the rice and vegetables had already become cold. It felt like a cold-faced, heartless guest had entered one's warm stomach. It was really difficult to digest. Secondly, the dishes cooked by the packaged meal service were cooked in a large pot. The bigger the packaged meal service, the more meals they provided, and the dishes were all the same. One table had these few dishes, and another table had the same few dishes. They fed thousands of people every day. Therefore, the fish and meat all tasted the same. Moreover, the rice was also of inferior quality and was not cooked to the right consistency. Therefore, even when the waiter came to invite them to eat dinner, they could only leave with a sigh.</p>

<h3>Gold Price Soars by Ten Taels</h3>
<p>Rapid Rise, Optimistic Outlook</p>
<p>The Situation Develops Greatly  Yesterday, the 25th, the bidding price of gold rose sharply, exceeding 590 taels, a significant increase of more than ten taels. The rise was orderly and steady. In the morning session, there was a difference of about six taels. In the afternoon session, there was a swing of only two taels. The situation developed greatly. The exchange rate was somewhat weak, with the listed price shrinking by one level in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The industry was struggling, and the market was seeking to replenish supplies. Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Chengyong, and others were all competing to buy, while sellers included Zhifeng, Yongwanxing, and Yuanli. Overseas silver prices were low, indicating that the gold price would open high. Afterwards, there was only a fluctuation of one tael, and the rise was rapid, soaring straight up. By noon, it had risen by five taels, reaching above ninety-six taels. In the afternoon session, Dadecheng, Tong Taichang, and others were buying, while Heng Fuchang, Xie Yu, and others were selling. The exchange rate was particularly weak and tight, both officially and unofficially. The industry continued to struggle. However, the gold price fluctuated from time to time, probably due to the different buying and selling. In the end, it was extremely sharp, exceeding ninety-eight taels. Since the swap, it has been at a new high price, and the future is still optimistic. It is said that the bulk orders this morning will definitely be lower.</p>
<p>The Market Climbs Steadily  The opening price of gold for the month of January this morning was 590 taels and nine qian, already up two taels and eight qian. The gross price was ninety to ninety-one taels, and then it retreated by one tael. Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Chengyong, and others were buying, while Shunli, Wanxing, Taikangrun, and others were selling. The price of bulk orders and silver had fallen by one-eighth. Afterwards, buyers were not idle, and it rose to ninety-one taels and six qian. The exchange rate was also firm, and various firms were trying to climb. Mitsui issued January British gold at 17125 and bought December Japanese gold at one tael, two qian, and seven and a half fen. Then, because Zhifengyong, Xie Yuyongfeng, and others sold, it immediately depreciated by one tael. When the initial order was issued, it was only calculated at ninety taels and six qian, and the listed price was reduced by one or two five. The US dollar on the 25th added one point to the Japanese gold, but the gold price was flat, only adding one tael, two or three qian, and then falling back to ninety taels and nine qian. This was because exchange rate was sold for hedging. Moreover, the Chinese Bank of January British gold did not stop selling, and the price was still 17125. Later, Sanlin sold to California Bank and Datong December Citibank at 38 yuan and 75 cents. By ten o'clock, it gradually rose to ninety-two taels. Then, Yu Da, Yuan Heng, Yongshengchang, and others took to the stage to compete for entry. Subsequently, the market rose by more than two taels. The market atmosphere was almost like the sun rising to the top of the pole, and the British gold was also tightening at 0625. Mitsui Shanghai Friends sold 170625, so at eleven o'clock it was ninety-four taels, seven or eight qian. A moment later, Zhifengyong and others sold it, falling back to one tael, zero taels, and three taels, six or seven qian. After that, the January British gold had to be settled at 17, and the November British gold was at 169375. Moreover, Xie Yuyongfeng, Wanxing Shunli, and others bought it back, and Tong Taichang also bought it, so the price jumped two or three taels until the market closed at noon, reaching six taels and four qian. People slightly suppressed it by two or three qian, and the published price had been changed to 627 taels. Because the Japanese gold had added one point, it was calculated at 36 taels to 31 taels.</p>
<p>Re-Picking High After Closing  The afternoon session opened at ninety-six taels, with Yuan Maoyong Yuancheng, Fengyong, etc buying. Because the Indian Exchange reported being small, people were very excited and immediately blasted to ninety-eight taels. Dalian sold to Mitsui one liang for two qian eight fen five six two five, and Maihang and HSBC did March British Jin for one seven, but in the end Zhifeng Yongfuchang came to sell, and January British Jin could settle at one seven, Da Ying and Datong had sold, so it fell by more than one liang, and at 1.5 points it was ninety-six and a half liang. At this time, British Jin also listed one two five, and US dollar added one point to Japanese Jin, and then rose to seven liang two or three qian. Yongfeng and zero households sold, so it went down one or two qian. More than two points, fifty cents for six liang one qian, and then, Tong Taichang and others bought and immediately added one liang. Until about three fifty, Zhifengyong tended to sell, and the calculation at four o'clock flew suddenly soaring, and Zhifeng Yong and others all fell to compete to buy and suddenly raised another two liang, and January British Jin only closed at one six nine three seven five to four twenty was ninety-eight and two qian, and fell to seven liang three or four qian, to four or half-time closing for ninety-seven liang seven qian, compared with the previous day was激涨nine liang and six qian, subsequently重又抬至八两四五钱goods compared to the bund listing eight qian查终日最大价八两二钱最小价零六钱相差七两六钱揭价又改为六百三十二两八因日金二次加大一分计撳三十四五两最后撳小三十四两登账六百○三两十二月五百九十九两一月九十六两补水六百○三两下午○五两物品早市一两午收六两一下午六两三收市八两半、</p>

<h3>Foreign exchange market edge ten thousand ends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market was low, and the foreign exchange market did not change. As for the HSBC listing, each exchange rate has been reduced twice, totaling one level. From the morning, it was reduced by half a level, with the British exchange rate at 125, breaking through 7 cents. The exchange rate was 25, the Indian exchange rate was 75, the French franc was six yuan, the Japanese-Western exchange rate was 75, the German exchange rate was one yuan, and the Singapore exchange rate was increased by one or two. Hong Kong fell by one or two, and the Japanese gold rose by one point. At 2:30 p.m., the exchange rate was reduced by half a level, with the British gold at 125, calculated at 6 cents and 775, the US dollar reduced by 25, calculated at 28 yuan, the Indian exchange rate reduced by 75, calculated at 105 rupees, the French franc reduced by 75, calculated at 965 yuan, the Dutch price reduced by half a yuan, calculated at 94 guilders, the German exchange rate reduced by one or two, calculated at 159 marks, the Singapore exchange rate increased by 75, calculated at 148 taels, and Hong Kong fell again by 5 yuan, now only calculated at 80 taels. The Japanese exchange rate added one point, calculated at one liang and three qian one fen. The interbank market was also very tight, rising sharply at first, then becoming more sharp in the afternoon, and even higher. It had broken through the 7 cent mark. This was because the gold market was rising sharply, exceeding 598 taels. The goods were hedging enthusiastically and were slightly short. However, large households such as Fengchang Zhifengyong and Dalianbang all sold. As a result, compared to the previous day, it had risen by almost ten taels. Compared to the previous night, the British gold was reduced by 25, the US dollar was reduced by half a yuan, and the Japanese gold rose by one point and 25. In the Chinese gold industry, companies such as Fengyong Fuchang Yong Juechang were fiercely selling in order to cash out the slips. A total of 400,000 pounds of British gold were traded. Banks were still selling vigorously, with Erjing Huabi Hefeng Shanghai Zhijin Datong Taiwan Sumitomo Jiaren British and Dutch all supplying. However, HSBC was absorbing some. Meifeng Dalianbang had slightly sold off, while Huabi Maihang Datong had absorbed some. Various banks had also traded with each other, with a total of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan traded. Dalianbang sold tens of thousands of yuan of Japanese gold, which was absorbed by Erjing. The market atmosphere was very good, and bulk orders still had a downward trend.</p>
<h3>Foreign Silver Market Continued to Decline</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Reuters, the silver market was falling sharply. The London market was selling slightly, but the supply from other parties was lacking. After the market closed, because a few short positions were settled, the market situation was still stable. The near-term shrank by 125 to 16 cents and a half (equivalent to 1 shilling 7 cents and a half for British gold), and the far-term also shrank by 125, calculated at 16 cents, 375. According to New York Reuters, the US silver price also shrank by 125, calculated at 35 cents 625. The British dollar to US dollar, US dollar to British dollar, British dollar to Japanese dollar, and Japanese dollar to US dollar remained unchanged. The Shanghai shilling increased by 0625 to one shilling seven cents. Mumbai spot fell by a small amount of one anna, calculated at 47 rupees and 06 annas.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Situation at the End of the Small Period</h3>
<p>Market Overview  This year, the financial community has been mostly waiting and watching due to the poor commercial situation in Shanghai for the most part of the year, resulting in a business that is not very expanded and difficult to make profits. The closure is also slightly simpler than last year. Therefore, the usual small comparison yesterday was clearly transferred to the collection. This year's wasted time, the good commercial opportunities are wasted, it is a pity that we cannot save it</p>
<p>Clearing Price ( 洋厘 )  The early market was seven cents, two cents, four cents, and seven haos, slightly smaller by two haos than the previous noon, while the noon market returned to its original price, which was seven cents, two cents, and five cents, ( 銀拆 ) The industry has relaxed again, yesterday's early market was one qian, and the noon market only opened at nine fen, and the addition of water at the top was initially two or three points, and then immediately 白　 , but there was no market. The bank's listing of four points shows that the current market's silver roots are difficult to be optimistic, and I am afraid that there is no hope for the general opportunity in the national calendar year.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Market Situation  Jiangnan small dollars suddenly rose sharply, and yesterday morning they actually added three li, calculated as six qian, four fen, and seven li. The noon market was half a li better, at six qian, four fen, and seven and a half li. The transaction was made in the early market with 5,000 jiao and 4,500 jiao in the noon market. Guangdong small dollars were the same for both the early and noon markets at six qian, four fen, two li, and two haos, with the transaction made in the early market with 85,000 jiao and 50,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins shrank again by 1,000, totaling 382,500 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow ( 銀欵 )  Yesterday, the bank's collection was simplified to a moderate level. The Chinese merchants' collection of ticket funds was more than 2.7 million, the foreign merchants' collection of ticket funds was more than 2 million, the settlement and collection of funds was more than 3 million, and the collection of various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous funds was 10780,000.

<h3>Securities Public Debt This Month's Term Will Be Closed Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bond price continued to be firm, and the rise was better than the fall</p>
<p>The market is still strong, and the turnover is 13 million</p>
<p>Today's Chinese securities trading will first stop bidding for the November futures trading due to the approaching delivery period, so that it can handle various procedures before delivery. Therefore, today's futures market has only one type of December futures. As for the market situation of various public debts, the futures market is still good, the popularity of buyers and sellers is still active, and all parties continue to have huge transactions. Even the spot market is still good, and most bonds have slightly opened. Due to the good environment of the bond market, the bulls are strong, and the market's needs are still better than the sellers. Therefore, the price is more firm than before. The total spot opening throughout the day was 40,400 yuan, and the futures opening in the morning was more than 5.8 million and 7.8 million in the afternoon, totaling more than 13.6 million.</p>

<h3>Slackness Prevails in the Yarn Flower Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market is increasingly sluggish, actual sales are particularly light, and overseas cotton yarn market conditions are generally trending downward. Therefore, Japanese merchants have a deep desire to dump stock. However, in forward contracts, there are still retail investors preparing to buy. In recent months, the market has been suppressed due to the oversupply of 20-count "Five Rams" brand yarn.</p>
<p>Human Label Falls by Eighty or Ninety Cash: In the morning market for "Human Label" yarn, the opening price was flat and soft due to the further decline in American cotton. In the second and third sessions, sellers slightly increased, with prices dropping by two, three, and four cash. In the afternoon, news of sluggish actual sales caused a further decline in third-grade products, with prices falling by three, four, five, and six cash. The total transaction volume for the day was统计 one thousand five hundred and two hundred bales. Sales included 1,350 bales of "Yi Yu," 1,050 bales of "Xinhua," 950 bales of "Xinchang," 850 bales of "Da Yi," and 800 bales of "Tiancheng," with the remaining bales in the two-three hundred range.

<h3>Sharp Decline in This Month's Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market experienced a breakdown this month, with a sudden drop of 750 cash. Shanghai merchants had long prepared to short sell. The global cotton industry is weak and sluggish. Factories have purchased sufficient Indian cotton and currently have no need for more. Higher prices lead to even slower transactions, resulting in a significant lack of buyers. There were rumors of two yarn factories purchasing cotton the day before, but they have no intention of buying due to the high prices, leading to a sudden decline. The forward contracts were affected, but the bullish sentiment in forward contracts remains strong. The current cotton business in the market is exceptionally bleak.</p>
<p>This Month's Label Drops by 750 Cash: In the morning market for "Han Label" cotton, the opening price fell by 150 cash due to the further decline in American cotton. Sellers surged in the second and third sessions, with the current month falling by 50 cash and the forward contracts falling by 100 cash.

<h3>Food and Rice Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, over 30 rice boats from various regions arrived. Sales continue to be sluggish. The sales of white粳 (japonica) rice varied. Higher-quality rice saw acceptable transactions, with prices dropping by a small amount. Top-grade rice barely maintained 14 yuan and 9 jiao, while ordinary and lower-grade rice fell by 2 jiao and 5 fen. 稻竟 (dao jing) rice: Customers arrived to the source in succession.

The sales of 羊秈 (yang xian) rice were weak, and prices were slightly soft. The trend of 杜尖 (du jian) rice also lacked vitality, with both arrivals and sales being slow, falling by over one jiao. Rice from other ports stabilized slightly, with prices as high as 11 yuan and 8 jiao. Retail sales were better, and the market was firm. Yin yuan rice had no sense of honor or disgrace, with prices as high as 13 yuan.</p>
<p>Hunan: Yesterday, over 20 boats arrived from 河下 (He Xia). The sales of northern 粳 (japonica) rice were extremely sluggish, with top-grade rice opening at 14 yuan and 5 jiao, while medium and lower grades had to fall by more than 3 jiao. 苏同 white 粳 (japonica) rice also trended downward, and the situation was even worse. The entire day's sales in both urban and rural areas were sluggish, and the situation was quiet. Ordinary Hui Li 粳 (japonica) rice only opened at 12 yuan and 1-2 jiao. The decline in early rice such as 南路, 泗涇 (Si Jing), and 青浦 (Qingpu) rice deepened, with prices falling by a significant 3-4 jiao. This was mainly because buying interest was weak, and the producing markets softened. The appetite for 羊杜 (yang du) and other varieties was still acceptable here, but buyers bargained significantly. The general price was lowered by one jiao. Top-grade 通變 (tong bian) rice was still sold at 44 yuan and 8 jiao. Sales were good, with some restaurants asking about prices. The market was stable, and yin yuan rice remained flat.</p>
<h3>客秈 (Ke Xian) Rice Seems Slightly More Lively</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 客秈 (ke xian) rice market remained flat. There were sporadic sales toward the end of the day for social purposes on this street. Yesterday, the Xiamen merchants also purchased over one hundred bags of early Jiangxi machine rice, and the market was slightly more lively. In the future, the Xiamen and Fuzhou merchants will continue to purchase. Merchants on this street have also agreed to purchase. The market seems to be stable in the short term. Unless there are unexpected changes, prices will likely fluctuate slightly within the year. Yesterday's transactions included 100 bags of Hunan machine rice at a price of 10 yuan and 8 jiao; 300 bags of machine yuan rice at a price of 12 yuan, 3 jiao, and 4 jiao; 350 bags of early Jiangxi machine rice at a price of 10 yuan, 0 jiao, and 3 jiao and a half to 10 yuan, 0 jiao, and 2 jiao; over 100 bags of machine yuan rice at a price of 14 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen; and 200 bags of Nanjing machine rice at a price of 10 yuan, 0 jiao, and 1 jiao and a half. Except for over 100 bags of early machine rice purchased by Xiamen merchants, all were purchased by merchants on this street, it is said.</p>
<h3>Noodle Market Declines and Trends Towards Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the noodle market in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month generally reverted to weakness. As the quoted prices in Chicago did not rise or fall much and the prices in Canada fell by a small amount of 4-5 jiao, most people were somewhat hesitant and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. However, the business of the exchange has decreased compared to the past because, in terms of the environment, the market is difficult to be optimistic about. However, domestic wheat still cannot follow the decline. The number of goods shipped by manufacturers has generally reached the quota, and new short positions are rarely taken. Consequently, both the long and short sides are mostly watching and have not dared to make active entries and exits. Therefore, the market atmosphere appears dim. As a result, the current month was down 1 fen from the previous day, December was up 2 li and a half, January/February was down 7 li and a half, March was unchanged, and April was down 2 li and a half. The standard grade for this month has been announced. The green Three Stars did not meet the appetite of the merchants and fell by another 3 fen compared to the previous month. According to the standard, it must be different by 6 fen. There are few other changes. In addition, a deposit of 300 taels is required for more than 1 jiao and a half. However, due to business relations, it is still changed to 200 taels, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market in a Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month again trended towards decline. As the current month is close to delivery, the short side has prepared to deliver the goods. However, although most of the long side has suffered too much loss and had to accept delivery, a small number of floating long positions had to close out positions, resulting in a low of 4 taels and 1 qian, which is a new price not seen this year. The sentiment for each month in the forward term was also quiet due to foreign wheat. Each disk opened and then softened. As a result, the current month was down 2 fen from the previous day, December was down 3 fen, January/February was down 2 fen, March was down 1 fen, and April was down 3 fen. The spot market was very quiet due to the factory appetite, and arrivals were not abundant. The entire city was not open, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Meiya and Others Continue to Purchase Yellow and White Factory Waste</h3>
<p>Financial turmoil continues to arise in overseas countries. New York and Lyon have been devastated by wind, snow, rain, and floods, and the economy is increasingly uneasy. No one inquires about raw silk. Silk telegrams are not transmitted, and silk sales have stagnated. However, domestic silk factories that do not use artificial silk have a considerable need for medium and low-grade yellow and white factory waste. Yesterday, Meiya continued to purchase 30 packages of yellow factory waste from Hubei cocoons and Shanghai raw silk. Weicheng purchased 20 packages of white factory waste, and prices were firm.</p>
<h3>Autumn Dry Cocoons Arriving at Factories Not Weak</h3>
<p>Over 30 silk factories in this port followed advice and reluctantly resumed work. However, most of the factories' dry cocoons were mortgaged to financial institutions and lacked funds to redeem them. Raw materials were insufficient. The opening price of autumn cocoons was relatively cheap. Domestic silk weaving factories had a strong need for medium and low-grade factory waste. Therefore, they all replenished their purchases of autumn cocoons, and transactions were quite lively. Yesterday, at the guild, 480 dan of autumn dry cocoons from Hangzhou and Shaoxing and other regions were transacted. 756 jin of silk discounted at 78 taels was pulled out. Each package of pure cocoons had to pull out 570-580 taels of silk plus reeling costs, etc. Factories still have difficulty making a profit, it is said.</p>
<h3>Gongxi Tea Sales to Russia are Uniquely Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market of this port, Russian firms continued to show a strong intention to purchase Gongxi green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi. The total transaction volume for the city was over 1,200 boxes, and the selling price was unchanged from the previous day. Tudor Yanghang also had a slight appetite for Zhenmei of medium and low grades, but the selling price was 1-2 taels lower than before. The rest were completely stagnant, it is said.</p>
<h3>Clothing Head Goods Eastern Goods Showed a Good Image</h3>
<p>The clothing head market turned slightly yesterday, with Chinese goods, Hua Cashmere rising by two and a half li, Fuhua at 1 qian 9 fen 2 li and a half, Huxinting at 1 qian 9 fen, and Qiba Yang Guifei White Peony also uniformly requiring 1 qian 8 fen 7 li and a half. In fact, the current selling prices all require losses. Recently, customer activity has been more active than before, so they are generally unwilling to sell. Among tribute nylons, Changbanqiao is the firmest, rising from 3 qian 4 fen and a half to 3 qian 5 fen 2 li and a half. There is a strong need from Wintai and inland regions. Shile Island, which has been out of stock for a long time, sold out yesterday at an opening price of 3 qian 6 fen and a half. Among the colored strips, Fei Lian and two colors are the most popular. Hanshan Temple Seven Treasure Beads bald color already requires 7 taels and 2 qian. The bald blue stripe is still at 6 taels and 6 qian and a half. The decline in blue stripe cashmere is very fierce, with Ersunfu falling to 5 taels and 1 qian, and Denggao at 5 taels and 1 qian and a half. The decline in bleached cashmere is also continuing, with Qilin at 8 taels and 1 qian and a half, Shuangtong Deer at 7 taels and 7 qian and a half, and Kandie at 7 taels and 6 qian and a half, it is said.</p>
<h3>Over Two Thousand Dan of New Foreign Silver Dollars Arrive</h3>
<p>Spot new foreign silver dollars are scarce, and the market image is outstanding, so prices have risen sharply. Each dan can be estimated at 5 taels and 5 qian. It is heard that Gonghexiang Haiyang Stack and others arrived with over 2,000 dan of spot goods yesterday. Therefore, in terms of market prices, there may be no worries about shortages in the future.</p>
<h3>Oil Market White Tung Oil Trends Ordinary</h3>
<p>Sales of white tung oil to foreign countries are still difficult to progress. Foreign disks do not rise or fall much. Yirui Yanghang purchased 50 tons of spot goods at a price of 16 taels and 4 qian. However, the customer disk has seen a return to freshness. Cracked tung is sold at 15 taels and 2 qian. After several sharp declines in domestic wholesale disks, each merchant's appetite has become strong, and the market has turned firm. Chunyuan and other brands are sold at 15 taels, foreign standard grain. Shenchang and other brands are sold at 14 taels and 6 qian. It is found that the large customers of tung oil still lack large amounts of absorption, and goods on the Xiangtong route have arrived in Hankou. The market is not optimistic, it is said.</p>

<h3>Continued Record of Internal Debt Creditor Group News</h3>
<p>Expected to be Formally Established Within the Month</p>
<p>Preliminary Procedures are Underway for Registration</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association initiated the organization of the Internal Debt Creditor Group, which was detailed in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, this newspaper's reporter specially visited Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry and Standing Committee Member of the Banking Association, to inquire about everything in detail. According to his reply, the main purpose of the Banking Association's initiation of the Internal Debt Creditor Group is to ensure that internal and external debts enjoy absolutely equal rights. According to government statistics, the total amount of internal and external debts is approximately 1.3 billion yuan, with internal debt accounting for slightly more than 30% of the total and external debt accounting for slightly less than 70%. However, the Nishihara loans of more than 200 million yuan are not included. The Internal Debt Creditor Group will be formally established after the representatives of the banks in Beiping and Tianjin arrive. It is expected to be completed within the month. After the establishment of the creditor group, the first step will be to conduct a joint registration of national internal debt creditors. All non-banking creditors can come to register. Then, a general meeting will be convened to elect formal representatives to discuss reorganization measures with the Ministry of Finance. The statement that the Internal and External Debt Reorganization Committee will hold a meeting in Shanghai and that banking representatives will attend is completely inaccurate, he said.</p>
<h3>Internal and External Debt Reorganization Meeting</h3>
<p>No Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Li Sihao Has Not Yet Taken Office</p>
<p>There were rumors that the Internal and External Debt Reorganization Committee continued to hold a reorganization meeting in Shanghai yesterday. Yesterday, this newspaper's reporter specially interviewed a certain important figure in the Ministry of Finance. According to him, there was no meeting of any kind today (the 25th). Minister Song was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Nanjing at 3:00 p.m., but he did not come temporarily. Therefore, it was impossible to attend the meeting. As for when and where the newly appointed Chairman of the Internal and External Debt Reorganization Committee, Mr. Li Sihao, will take office, there is currently no news, he said. The various important pieces of news are compiled and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She (New Voice Society) said that the Ministry of Finance has made detailed plans for reorganizing internal and external debts and has drafted a plan to announce to internal and external debt creditors. It is heard that the methods and time limits for the order of repayment of various debts, whether secured or unsecured, have been determined. The repayment period for both internal and external debts is set at 30 years. Regarding the internal debt portion, it is limited to those issued by the government through the Ministry of Finance. Other debts, such as the former Ministry of Transportation's Transportation Public Bonds, Electrical Public Bonds, and provincial bonds, are not within the scope of this reorganization.</p>
<p>Ri Ri She (Daily News) said that national unification and the pacification of wars make the reorganization of internal and external debts an essential plan for financial management. The reorganization of external debts was held in Nanjing on the 15th. The principles put forward by our side are nothing more than slightly flattening the interest rates of the various debts, earlier and later, and designating one of the national tax revenue items specified by the central government as a source of funds for installment payments. The predetermined time limit should not exceed 30 years at the latest. As a result of the meeting of Chinese and foreign representatives, it was decided that each country would proceed separately and independently. If necessary, meetings would be convened to resolve the issues. It is understood that the reason for this is Japan's Nishihara loans. These loans were provided during the Beiping government era by Japan to promote internal strife in China. They have no legal basis, and the National Government has long declared their repudiation and has issued a memorandum to the Japanese government. However, the Japanese side still included the Nishihara loans this time, so it should negotiate with the Japanese side separately to abolish them. In addition, as for the Hukuang loans, they were divided among the four countries of England, France, the United States, and Germany in 1911. Now, the majority of the debts have been merged into the United States. Therefore, the US side pays special attention to the principles put forward to our country. According to information from a certain party, our country's foreign debts have increased due to the soaring gold prices. It is heard that our country plans to implement the collection of gold for imports after the new customs tariff is promulgated as a way to offset foreign debts so as not to suffer losses.</p>

Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., Madame Zhang personally went to the Kong residence on West Aixiensi Road to express her gratitude. Because Madame Kong insisted that she stay in Shanghai for several days, the itinerary has been delayed. However, she will return to Nanjing at the latest tomorrow night.

<h3>Shanghai-Yichang Aviation</h3>
<p>Officially Flies on December 16th</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation has now decided to expand the Shanghai-Hankou air route to Yichang and has scheduled to officially fly beginning on the 16th of next month. China National Aviation Corporation originally planned to expand the Shanghai-Hankou line to Chongqing in October. However, due to Liu Xiang's opposition, the Ministry of Transportation sent Nie Kaiyi, Deputy Director of the Airline Group of the Airline Corporation, to Sichuan to discuss the matter with Liu Xiang. Liu Xiang expressed to Nie that he did not object to Shanghai-Chongqing aviation. However, the use of personnel and administration at the Chongqing air station must be controlled by the Sichuan side, and even the planes must be commanded by Liu. In that case, if necessary, Shanghai-Chongqing planes could be seized in Chongqing for military use. Mr. Nie returned because the negotiations were unsuccessful. The Shanghai-Chongqing aviation business was also temporarily suspended. Now, in order to develop the aviation business, China National Aviation Corporation has decided to first operate the Shanghai-Yichang route. The flight details have also been specified, which will divide the Shanghai-Yichang line into two sections. The Shanghai-Hankou section will remain the same, with daily round-trip flights except on Sundays. The Hankou-Yichang section is now scheduled to fly round-trip once every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Thursday. The plane will take off from Hankou at 8:15 a.m. and arrive in Yichang at 10:30 a.m. The plane will fly from Yichang at 11:00 a.m. and arrive in Hankou at 1:15 p.m. The one-way fare is 52 yuan per passenger, and the round-trip fare is 78 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Wenzhou Restores Freight Transportation Starting Today</h3>
<p>The Wenzhou Strike Ban Wave is Resolved</p>
<p>Foreign and Guangdong Goods are Still Not Subject to Unified Tax</p>
<p>The Yongjia Unified Donation Bureau merged the Wenzhou Foreign and Guangdong Goods Donation and changed it to a Unified Tax, which triggered a strike and transportation wave. It has been nine days since the 17th. No Wenzhou goods have been transported, ships have been emptied, workers have been laid off, and the obstruction of goods has affected the market, which is not insignificant. Yesterday afternoon, Shanghai received a telegram from Wenzhou stating that the rejection donation and strike transportation wave had ended. The information obtained from various parties after investigation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tax Bureau Stops Collecting Unified Donations The outbreak of this wave was due to the change of Foreign and Guangdong Goods Donations to Unified Tax. According to the old rules, for every 100 yuan of goods, donations and taxes must be increased, ranging from 6 yuan and 6 jiao to 10 yuan. Each commercial firm refused to acknowledge it because it was too heavy a burden. Therefore, it used strike transportation and suspension of business as a means to demand the cessation of changes. The tax bureau initially refused to cancel it and confronted the commercial groups. Neither side would budge. After ten days (since the merger on the 16th), it was heard that each store would further cease operations. It was not until yesterday that the Chamber of Commerce came forward to mediate. Foreign and Guangdong goods will still be taxed according to the original tax rules, and the change to a Unified Tax will be abolished. The tax bureau expressed its agreement, and the Chamber of Commerce immediately notified each commercial firm to cancel the strike transportation.</p>
<p>Commercial Groups Cancel Strike Transportation Yesterday afternoon, the Wenzhou group received a telegram from Oujiang stating that the foreign and Guangdong taxes were still levied according to the old rules and that the purpose of the request had been achieved. The various industries' strike transportation and boycott will stop on the 25th. Beginning today, all Wenzhou export goods will be declared, loaded, and taxed as usual. The dock workers will also resume work starting today. The goods to be shipped from Shanghai can be transported as much as possible. A major wave has come to an end.</p>
<p>Accumulated Goods Rushed to Load and Transport to Shanghai The China Merchants Bureau Haiyan and Guangji ships have been emptied three times, losing at least seven or eight thousand yuan. Yesterday afternoon, they received a telegram from Wenzhou stating that the tax matter had been resolved and that the goods accumulated in Wenzhou were plentiful. Starting on the 26th, loading can begin. Shanghai has also notified each customer to quickly declare and transport the goods that have been detained. A large wave has come to an end.</p>
<h3>The 25th Anniversary of the Coronation of the Norwegian King</h3>

In addition to the consular corps, those who attended included Chen Shiguang and Liu Yunfang, Director and Deputy Director of our Foreign Affairs Office, and enjoyed champagne, tea, and refreshments before leaving.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador Johnson Promoted to Nanjing Last Night</h3>

He plans to stay for two or three weeks and then go to Beiping for Christmas.

<p>Continue to Negotiate Various Outstanding Cases</p>
<p>After relinquishing his concurrent position as Consul General, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in China, Mr. Shigemitsu Aoi, devoted himself to handling various outstanding cases in Sino-Japanese negotiations and made considerable efforts. He came to Shanghai a few days ago to handle the handover of new and old affairs. He is now scheduled to be promoted to Nanjing at the end of this month to be stationed in Nanjing for a long time to negotiate various outstanding cases between China and Japan. Such as the Sino-Japanese Ning case, Han case, and the recent Changsha case, which are all intended to be actively negotiated for an early resolution, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yang Shuzhuang Returned to Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Minister of the Navy and Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, Mr. Yang Shuzhuang, previously attended the Fourth Plenary Session and reported the political situation of the province to Chairman Jiang. He took a boat from Fujian, passed through Shanghai, and was promoted to Nanjing. Now that the matter is over, he took the China Express train from Nanjing yesterday afternoon and arrived at the North Station at 11:55 p.m. on the same evening.

<h3>Italian Industrial Tourism Group to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Expected to Arrive on the 7th of Next Month</p>
<p>Since this year, Italy has been actively promoting Sino-Italian commerce, starting with expanding its shipping industry as a pioneer for developing its commercial and trade promotion in East Asia. Now, it has also organized a tourism group to come to China for inspection. What we have heard is recorded below:</p>
<p>Expanding the Shipping Industry: On the route between China and Italy, only one shipping company used to operate, dispatching six ships for voyages. Last year, four newly built motor vessels were added to sail to Shanghai. This autumn, the Italian Lloyd Triestino Shipping Company, with subsidies from the Italian government, began expanding its shipping business in the Far East. Recognizing the global trend of fast ships, it specifically divided the China-Italy route into two classes: mail ships and cargo ships. It removed the ships with smaller horsepower and replaced them with five purely passenger ships with high speed: the "Conte Verde," "Piero Toselli," "Conte Rosso," "Conte Biancamano," and "Viminale," to operate the mail ship service. This reduces the sea journey between China and Italy from the previous 38 or 39 days to 28 days. Another four ships will be dispatched to specialize in cargo for the Far East. The new ships are about to arrive. Sino-Italian merchant ships have thus leaped to become Royal Mail Ships.</p>
<p>Organizing a Tourism Group: With the expansion of shipping having been realized, the country is also starting to seek progress in trade with China. A Far East Tourism Group was organized by leaders of domestic manufacturers, factories, and import-export businesses. Its purpose is to promote Italian goods to the Far East, specifically coming to Shanghai and other places for inspection. The group has a total of 300 members and has already departed from Italy, having taken the Italian mail ship "Conte Verde" to Shanghai. Yesterday, this local newspaper received news that it has passed Singapore and will arrive in Shanghai at 9:00 AM on December 7th. The group members are mostly from the Italian industrial sector, but people from other Western countries have also joined. After inspecting Shanghai, they will go to the capital and then to Japan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Guilin Petition Representatives to Arrive Today</h3>
<p>The petition representatives from Guangxi Province, Gan Echun, Yang Yuan Gong, etc., sent to Beijing, are arriving in Shanghai today by ship from Hong Kong. After arriving in Shanghai, Gan and the others plan to go to Beijing immediately to request the central government to send Gan Lichu, commander of the 3rd Division under Jiang Dingwen, to Guangxi to assist the Guangdong army in pacifying the situation in Guangxi. This is because Gan Lichu is from Guangxi and can more easily accept the subordinates of Li Bai and others.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Welcome Chu Minyi Back to China</h3>
<p>Chu Expected to Arrive in Shanghai on December 12th</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Chu Minyi embarked on the "President McKinley" liner from America for Japan on the 20th. It is estimated that he will arrive in Japan on December 5th. He will stay for about four days and then leave Japan on the same ship, arriving in Shanghai on December 12th. Chu has won honor for national products this trip, his contribution is to the party and the nation. Therefore, people in Shanghai have organized a welcoming committee. Now that the date is approaching, people from his hometown of Huzhou have taken the lead in actively preparing for the welcome. We have learned the following arrangements: (1) Starting immediately, the address of the preparation office is located at No. 92, Pingle Lane, intersection of Xizang Road and Jiujiang Road; (2) The welcoming expenses will be entirely raised by Shao Rusheng from the Huzhou fellow villagers, without apportioning a single penny to the outside world; (3) The preparation office will publish advertisements in newspapers to solicit participation from various groups and individuals; (4) The welcoming methods and location will be decided by representatives from all sectors; (5) Banquets will be held separately by various groups or individuals. The Huzhou Fellow Villagers Association will host a separate banquet, it is said.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Circles Oppose Opium Poppy Planting in Fujian</h3>
<p>Holding a Joint Meeting</p>
<p>Advocating Thorough Resistance</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association states that the Fujian garrison is encouraging the planting of opium poppies in order to collect opium seedling taxes. The public groups in Fujian resisted this, but to no avail. The local garrison is still actively collecting taxes. At the request of various groups in Fujian, a joint meeting of all circles was held yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The mood was exceptionally indignant, and many proposals were made by various groups. The situation of the conference is recorded below:</p>
<p>Participating Groups: Fujian Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing, Fujian Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, Fujian Academic Association in Shanghai, United Association of All Circles in Xiamen, Chinese Overseas Affairs Advancement Association, Shanghai Jin-Hui Guildhall, Road Construction Association, Quanzhou Fellow Villagers Association in Zhejiang, Fujian Journalists Association, Lijiiao Joint Association, Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association, Youth Preaching Group, Chinese Red Cross Society, Chinese Medical Association, Universal Student Association, and 36 other groups, with over 60 representatives.</p>
<p>Representatives' Reports: The meeting started as scheduled at 4:00 PM. Huang Jiahuai, the general secretary of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, and Zhou Chucai, the director of the investigation department, successively reported on the recent situation of opium poppy planting in southern Fujian. In summary, they stated that the situation of opium poppy planting in southern Fujian has been reported by the public, and by major newspapers, and by the investigations of the Anti-Drug Association. The counties of Putian, Xianyou, and Hui'an, the districts of Zhangzhou, the villages of Fuding, and the area of Jinjiang have all been planted with opium poppies. The Zhang-Tong-Yan Pacification Office has been established to collect opium taxes, and the situation is urgent. Therefore, all representatives attending the meeting today should urgently discuss response methods. Subsequently, representatives from the Fujian Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing, the Fujian Anti-Drug Branch Association, the Fujian Journalists Association, the Penang Save Fujian United Association, the Fujian Academic Association in Shanghai, the Fujian Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, and the United Association of All Circles in Xiamen reported successively. Generally, they said that the planting of opium poppies is prevalent in Jinjiang County, Fujian, with the thirteen villages of Maping being the main source of the disaster. In Hui'an County, the opium seedlings are two or three inches tall from Fengting to Huicheng. In Tong'an County, opium poppies have been planted in more than forty villages, including the Lubanwei area of the Xinxu Public Security District. Opium seedlings have also been found in various villages in Nan'an County. In other areas, such as Xiangtian Lotus Mountain in Xianyou County, Meizhou in Zhao'an County, Dongsha Township in Tian County, and Yangzhongchen and Shangxia Kan villages in Ningde County, opium seedlings have also been discovered. The Fujian Provincial Government sacrificed four million opium seedling tax revenue to strictly prohibit opium poppy planting in the past, and only now has there been a glimmer of hope. Now, the counties in southern Fujian are still covered with opium seedlings. If the news spreads and other areas follow suit, the situation will spread like wildfire, poisoning the entire province and causing endless harm. Moreover, the garrison detachments are collecting opium taxes, totaling one million yuan in Zhangzhou and Tong'an, and hundreds of thousands of yuan in Jinjiang and Xianyou. The remote areas are not even worth mentioning. Even on both sides of the Quanan Zhangma highway, which passes through bustling and convenient transportation routes, opium seedlings have been found. The Fujian Anti-Opium Committee is perfunctory, and should be reorganized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Important Resolutions: The attending representatives proposed many motions. The resolutions that were passed are recorded below: (1) The representative of the Fuzhou Journalists Association proposed: (A) Request the government to reorganize the Fujian Anti-Opium Committee; (B) Strictly organize the Fujian Anti-Drug Branch Association; (C) Request the Fujian Provincial Government to issue a general order to all counties to establish opium detoxification hospitals to accommodate opium addicts; (D) Request the Fujian Provincial Government to severely punish the Japanese opium dens in Fuzhou that condone opium use. Resolution: Passed.

<h3>News on the Progress of the Two Bondholder Associations</h3>
<p>Relocating the Office and Hiring a Consultant</p>
<p>Since the organization and establishment of the Central Bank Provisional Exchange Certificate Bondholders Association and the National Government Ministry of Finance Treasury Bill Bondholders Association, all efforts have been made without reservation. Local and out-of-town bondholders are eagerly joining and registering. Because the association's original office (No. A-1, Shandong Road) was insufficient for expansion, it has now moved to Room 12, 2nd Floor, Xiexiangfang, No. 46, Aomen Road, to conduct business. In order to take matters seriously, the association has specially hired Sheng Zhenwei, a Doctor of Law from the United States, former assessor of the Mixed Court of the Shanghai International Settlement, and current dean of the Soochow University Law School, as its legal consultant to provide security and facilitate progress. It is reported that the association is now quietly waiting for the approval of Chairman Jiang of the National Government and Minister Wei of the Ministry of Finance. If necessary, it also plans to publicly elect representatives to go to Beijing to petition, not stopping until the goal is achieved. In addition, the association has recently received many registration letters for the Central Bank Hunan-Jiangxi-Guangxi General Certificate, the Central Bank Hubei-Hunan-Jiangxi Silver Dollar Certificate, the Central Bank Hankou banknotes, and the General Headquarters Quartermaster Department Certificate. Since these are not within the scope of the association's activities, they have all been politely declined in separate letters.</p>
<h3>Ministry's Approval of Half-Price Coal Freight</h3>
<p>Restoring Original Price from the First of This Month</p>
<p>The China National Coal Production and Sales Association received a directive No. 591 from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating: Having received the report and investigated, the Jiaoji Railway Management Committee previously temporarily suspended the export freight rate of coal on the line upon approval from the Ministry, because the coal shortage in Shandong Province was in urgent need of relief, and unscrupulous merchants were still taking advantage of the low export freight rate to transport stored coal out of the province regardless of the overall situation, so that foreign coal could take the opportunity to enter and flood various markets in Shandong Province. This measure was purely for relieving the coal shortage in Shandong Province and preventing foreign coal from seizing the market for domestic coal, and was of a temporary nature, not intended to increase railway revenue. It has now been reported by the committee that the supply and demand of coal in various parts of Shandong Province has been corresponding in recent months, and the export freight rate of coal on the line was restored on November 1st. The directive from the Ministry approved this to be filed for record. Now, according to the report stating the previous situation, this directive is hereby issued for notification.</p>
<h3>Result of Private Electrical Industry Petition</h3>
<p>Proposed by Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Passed by the Assembly</p>
<p>The National Federation of Private Electrical Industries, regarding its petition for guarantees and maintenance at the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session, had a bill proposed by Chairman Chiang, advocating for private enterprises to be protected. It has been submitted for review to the Fifth General Assembly. The Political Review Committee submitted opinions and the whole gathering passed it. From now on, the industry has another powerful layer of guarantee. The submitted draft and approved clauses are recorded below. The proposed text said (above omitted): An unclear system, close to being troublesome and harsh, competes with the people for profit. It is the stated policy of this party that any enterprise with monopolistic characteristics or which private individuals cannot operate should be operated with state capital. However, given the lack of economic development and the nascent construction today, state-run enterprises lack a concrete scale. It is appropriate to encourage private enterprise and add suitable protection. However, those in government often misunderstand the essence of the policy and do not consider the importance of relationships or the sentiment of the people. They often regard the recovery of private enterprises as a success. What is most criticized by the general public is the recovery of small, private electrical industries and the confiscation of private, nascent mines. The news causes people to be fearful and suspicious that the government is using its power to compete with the people for profit. They warn each other to be cautious about investing in industrial and commercial enterprises. This drives capital away from industry, causing the national economy to weaken. It is tantamount to driving fish into a deep pool, fostering the invasion of the international economy. The improper handling is the sixth mistake. (Below omitted) Proposers: Jiang Zhongzheng, co-signers: Hu Hanmin, Wang Chonghui, Dai Chuanxian. Also, it is heard that the main text of the opinion submitted by the Political Review Committee on the case: (B) (5) Regarding the management and operation of state-owned enterprises, the scope of authority should be clearly defined so that private enterprises can be protected. Passed by the Fifth General Assembly.</p>

<h3>Shipping Public Bonds to Be Issued Soon</h3>
<p>The shipping public bonds requested by the Shanghai Shipping Association have been repeatedly discussed with the government authorities by the chairman of the association, Yu Qiaqing, and have been instructed by the Executive Yuan to the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds under the newly added tariff items in the 20th year of the Republic of China. After receiving the news, Yu went to Beijing again this month to request the National Government to allocate funds under the increased tariff items in order to meet the urgent needs of shipping merchants and to speed up the process. Yu returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. According to what he told people, there is no question that the shipping public bonds will be issued, but in order to expedite the implementation, he made another trip to Beijing to request it. These public bonds will be realized soon, it is said.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Customs Announces Lifting of Flour Export Ban</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs previously received orders to prohibit the loading and export of flour to Dalian and foreign countries. Except for Tianjin and other places that have resumed the original lifting of the ban, other foreign countries are still subject to the prohibition. Recently, in response to the request of merchants, in order to use funds and develop sales channels, a special permission was granted to lift the ban. Yesterday, the Jianghai Customs officially announced the permission to load and export flour to Dalian and other foreign countries, but only for one year. Flour merchants have already started loading goods in recent days.</p>
<h3>The Name of the Shanghai Municipal Council Education Department to Be Changed Soon</h3>
<p>Explanation by Liu Zhan'en and Others</p>
<p>Liu Zhan'en, Yuan Ludeng, and Ou Yuanhuai's announcement states: We hereby announce that the Shanghai International Settlement Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a letter to investigate schools within the settlement under the name of the Education Department. Local people have declared their opposition to this matter, and it has been reported in the newspapers repeatedly. On the 13th of this month, the Executive Committee of the Third District of the Kuomintang even published an advertisement questioning Zhan'en and others. There may be some misunderstandings in the questions. The process is briefly described below. After Shanghai Public Concession Shanghai Ratepayers' Association, on March 26, 1928, contained a clause that "Under the current situation, the responsibility of expanding the education of Chinese people in the concession should be emphasized," the settlement organized a design agency called the Education Committee this year. The English name is "Board of Education." There are three Chinese members, four Western members, and one Japanese member. There are also Chinese directors and Chinese committee members, and Zhan'en and others were recommended to participate in the committee. Zhan'en and others believed that under the current situation in the settlement, there were too many people who did not attend school. It is necessary to urgently promote education so that the education of Chinese people in the settlement and national education can gradually converge. However, in order to promote education, it is necessary to first clarify the current situation of education in the settlement, otherwise there is no basis. This is the origin of the publication of the survey. As for the Shanghai Municipal Council issuing a letter of investigation in the name of the Education Department, it was not a resolution of the Education Committee, and Zhan'en and others had never heard of it. Because the Shanghai Municipal Council originally had an Education Department, those who translated Chinese used the word "Department" for the police, health, and other agencies of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Therefore, it was translated as "Department." After this matter was discovered, Zhan'en and others thought it was inappropriate and immediately proposed a change. It should be changed soon. We are grateful for the guidance from all walks of life, which shows the utmost concern for the education of Chinese people in the settlement and the importance of correcting names. We hereby announce the facts in accordance with the truth, and we hope that you will understand and observe.</p>
<h3>Sino-Foreign Joint Ventures May Appoint Representatives to Join the Chamber of Commerce</h3>

It was considered that whether it could be allowed had not been expressly stipulated, so opinions were prepared and submitted, allowing them to appoint representatives to join the Chamber of Commerce, but subject to three restrictions, and submitted to the Executive Yuan. Order No. 11442 from the Training Department of the Central Executive Committee stated: After reviewing the three measures drafted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Item 1, the representative appointed should be limited to citizens of the Republic of China according to law, and Item 2, more than half of the capital of the company or store must be Chinese shares, there is nothing inappropriate, and three more items should be added, namely, the Chinese side of the company or store must have more than half of the voting rights, and Item 3 of the original draft, more than half of the directors of the company must be citizens of the Republic of China, should be changed to Item 4, and ordered to comply, etc. Having received this order, in addition to submitting a reply, we hereby order your association to notify and comply. The city's Sino-foreign joint venture stores are probably not limited to the iron and steel machinery industry alone. Therefore, according to the previous cause, if such stores in various industries request to join the trade association in the future, they can be handled accordingly. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby send this letter for your information and compliance.</p>

<h3>Recent News on the Reorganization of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Goods from Henan Can Now Be Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong, the new general manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, has begun to reorganize the business. In recent days, he has begun to change branch managers, business directors, etc., in order to help implement the resumption of shifts and revitalize the bureau affairs on the first of next month. The information obtained is recorded below:</p>
<p>Removal of Bureau Chiefs: After the removal of Wang Hao, director of the Hankou Bureau, and the reassignment of Li Yunliang, an order was issued yesterday to the secretarial and affairs departments to review the handover report of Wang Quan. At present, the bureau chiefs along the Yangtze River are being reorganized first, and those who are not working effectively will be changed. Chongqing is an important port in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and a capable person must be in charge to compete with foreign ships. The original director, Zhu Biqian, has been removed and Liu Weizhao has been appointed to replace him. In addition, Feng Jingwu, the director of the Zhenjiang Bureau, has resigned and Guo Yanmo has been appointed to succeed him. He went to Zhenjiang yesterday to take over. Several more branch offices will be removed and transferred in the coming days.</p>
<p>Change of Captains: Captain He Hailan, a fair ship captain, was ordered by Li Zhonggong to transfer to the ship affairs section, and Jin Yueshi was appointed to replace him.

All the ships on the Yangtze River will be fully restored, and the branch directors in each port will be ordered to actively transport cargo in order to save the lost shipping rights. According to a telegram from Director Li of the Hankou Bureau yesterday, the Henan passenger traffic has been opened to transport tobacco from Xuchang, and the right to carry it has been obtained. The first batch of tobacco shipped to Shanghai after the war has more than 10,000 pieces. It was detained by the tax bureau when it was transported to Hankou.

<h3>Penalties for Shops in the French Concession Not Affixing Revenue Stamps</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Stamp Tax Bureau in the French Concession by Commissioners Liu Chunpu and Shen Rulin, they have planned and actively implemented the tax, and the tax revenue has been steadily improving. Merchants and residents in the concession also consider paying taxes a civic duty and are happy to affix stamps to documents such as pawn tickets for pawnshops and rent receipts for rented houses, which are being promoted gradually. If any shops, tempted by petty profits, are found to have omitted stamps on invoices or deliberately failed to issue invoices, the case will be immediately reported to the Stamp Tax Office in Shanghai, which will send a letter to the French Municipal Police to prosecute in the French Court. Previously, four shops, including Yanchang Coal Company, were summoned to court by the police and penalized for not affixing stamps. Commissioners Liu and Shen have now discovered that Hongfa Sugar Company on Yangxing Street issued an invoice for over 1,000 taels without affixing stamps, and that the delivery book of Lao Yida Dyehouse on Avenue Edward VII also failed to affix stamps as required. They reported this to the French Municipal Police, who summoned the parties to court yesterday. Commissioner Liu Chunpu also appeared in court to testify and present the case. Presiding Judge Zhu sentenced Hongfa Sugar Company to a fine of 20 yuan and Lao Yida Dyehouse to a fine of 15 yuan as a warning. Any omissions discovered in the future will be severely penalized.</p>
<h3>Petition for Interdiction Case</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Cai Changming, accompanied by Cai Shengnan, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the French Court, stating that Cai Changming, the first petitioner, is the younger brother of Cai Changgen, and Cai Shengnan, the second petitioner, is the nephew of Cai Changgen. Recently, Cai Changgen has been ill for a long time and has lost consciousness. His wife, Chen, is about to sell all his property and return to her hometown with the money. Therefore, their lawyer published a notice opposing this. Chen has also hired a lawyer to defend her position. Hence, this urgent petition for interdiction, requesting that the petitioners be appointed as guardians to manage the property, so that it can be returned to Changgen when he recovers. Chen, represented by her lawyer, argued that the statements made by the plaintiff's lawyer are utterly absurd. Cai Changgen's property is actually the property of his wife, Chen. Changgen is ill, but Chen is healthy and naturally has the right to manage the property. According to the law, an interdiction can only be initiated at the request of the person themselves or their spouse. How can a third party come forward to petition for interdiction? It is clearly an attempt to embezzle the property. If they want to seize the property, they should just say so. This kind of request will only be ridiculed by legal professionals across the country. She requested that the petition be rejected. Judge Gong ordered the parties to leave and await a decision. Before the case is concluded, Chen is not allowed to transfer the property without authorization.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Accountants Association Meeting</h3>

<h3>Xue's Concubine's Request for Division of Inheritance Still in Mediation</h3>
<p>Xue Gu Qiaolin, the concubine of the late famous dye merchant Xue Baorun, and her daughter Xue Baobao, filed a lawsuit through lawyer Zheng Yuxiu, demanding a share of the inheritance that was controlled by the main wife Xue Sun and her son Gansheng, to support their livelihood. This has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that lawyer Chen Zemin and Xu Yabo, a relative of Xue Gu Qiaolin, negotiated a mediation yesterday. Chen stated that Xue's estate was not as much as the 1.8 million claimed by the plaintiff, and that it should be calculated based on the remaining assets after deducting debts, which would make an agreement more likely. Xu believed that starting from this point would result in too large of a discrepancy, and suggested that Chen further consult with a prominent figure or Zheng Yuxiu directly, hoping to reach a peaceful settlement before the court hearing, to avoid hurting feelings.</p>

<h3>Rally to Support Xiao and Oppose the Dutch</h3>
<p>Meeting Today</p>
<p>Time... This afternoon at 1:00 PM</p>
<p>Location... Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Tianhou Palace</p>
<p>Twenty organizations, including the Overseas Chinese Federation and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Advancement Association, jointly initiated the "Rally to Support Xiao and Oppose the Dutch," scheduled to be held at 1:00 PM this afternoon at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Tianhou Palace Bridge, North Henan Road, Public Concession. Minister Yang of the Municipal Party Department Propaganda Department and others will attend. All newspapers and news agencies, recognizing that this concerns the patriotic movement, will gather to report and take photos. The Foreign Affairs Support Association for Overseas Chinese Expelled from British and Dutch Territories in Nanjing telegraphed that the Overseas Chinese Federation decided to send all members from Beijing to Shanghai to attend. A two-zhang white cloth banner was hung at the gate of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, reading "Shanghai All Circles Support Xiao and Oppose the Dutch Rally." The venue was filled with slogans such as "Down with Dutch Imperialism" and "Boycott Java Steamships," creating a somber atmosphere. The telegrams from Nanjing and Xiamen and the meeting agenda and slogans are transcribed below.</p>
<p>Telegram from Nanjing: Overseas Chinese Federation Anti-Dutch Rally, all members of our association will attend. Special notice, Foreign Affairs Support Association for Overseas Chinese Expelled from British and Dutch Territories, respectfully.</p>
<p>Telegram from Xiamen: Overseas Chinese Federation and all institutions, associations, newspapers, and overseas Chinese, be aware that Dutch imperialists have established companies, sailing into our inland, seizing our profits, invading our shipping, and have long been hated by our people. Recently, they have disbanded our country's Dutch-affiliated party headquarters, expelled our party members, increased entry taxes for Chinese people, restricted Chinese ships from traveling in Dutch territories, banned Chinese party ideology books, and explicitly stipulated that Chinese people are on equal footing with indigenous people in taxation, all kinds of acts of tyranny and intentional insults, which have made our overseas Chinese gnash their teeth. This time, the imperialists have intensified their actions, allowing the first and second officers of their Zhibade ship to forcibly rape Ms. Xiao Xin'an of our country. This kind of animalistic behavior not only destroys women, but also clearly insults our national prestige, which has aroused public outrage across the country. They have risen up to resist. Our association believes that this matter concerns the national prestige. If we do not seize this case and strive to fight for it, what will become of our country's international future? Therefore, on the fish day, we presented it to the Siming County Party Affairs Guidance Committee, dispatching personnel to guide the meeting and discussion, and resolved to organize this association to provide support. Nanyang Commercial Association, Seamen's Branch, Wharf Workers' Union, and Tongren Association, Luo Hai Clearing Workers' Union, Gonghe Club Inn Workers' Union, Sugar and Oil Association, and Minzhan Association and other nine groups were elected as committee members and began work immediately. From Yang Day onwards, all cargo and passengers were stopped for Dutch ships until the goal of punishing the murderers and avenging the shame was achieved. However, fearing that the power of our association is limited and the countermeasures may not be comprehensive, we hope that all circles across the country will unanimously advocate, organize groups, and send urgent telegrams to the government, instructing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to strictly negotiate in the spirit of revolution to achieve victory. The urgency of this telegram is indescribable. Xiamen Support Xiao Case Committee, respectfully.</p>
<p>Meeting Agenda: (1) Ring the bell to start the meeting. (2) Bow three times to the Party and National Flag and the portrait of the Prime Minister. (3) Elect a temporary presidium. (4) The chairman of the presidium respectfully reads the Prime Minister's will. (5) Silent for three minutes (to commemorate the Prime Minister and mourn tens of thousands of overseas Chinese killed by Dutch soldiers over the years). (6) The chairman announces the purpose of the meeting. (7) The organizer reports on the preparation process. (8) Speeches. (9) Discuss proposals. (10) Pass a constitution and telegrams. (11) Elect representatives to petition in Beijing. (12) Shout slogans. (13) Ring the bell to end the meeting.</p>
<p>Meeting Slogans: (1) Down with Dutch imperialism. (2) Abolish the Sino-Dutch consular treaty. (3) Relieve the suffering of overseas Chinese in Dutch territories. (4) Abolish Article 109 of the Dutch regulations. (5) Boycott Java steamships. (6) Avenge the overseas Chinese who were killed and raped. (7) Severely punish the Dutch rapist gang.

<h3>Emergency Meeting on the Xin Case</h3>
<p>Expand Organization and Increase Committee Members</p>
<p>Send Letter to Du Yuesheng Requesting Justice</p>
<p>The Xin Dingxiang Tragedy Support Association held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Ningbo Sojourners Association. Representatives from the Citizens' Federation, Postal Workers' Union, Inland Shipping Workers' Union, Newspaper Delivery Workers' Union, Chinese and Foreign Cloth Industry Workers' Union, South Shanghai Cleaning Workers' Union, Chinese Electric Workers' Union, British and American Tobacco Workers' Union, Business Workers' Union, Sixth District Party Department, French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union, and Chinese Seamen's Union, as well as Xin Dingxiang's father Xin Hesheng and wife Xin Zhou, totaling over 100 people, attended. Liu Xinquan was elected chairman and Cheng Zhiliang as the recorder. First, the chairman reported on the purpose of convening the emergency meeting. Then, Cheng Zhiliang reported on the details of the Xin case and the recent situation in detail. Xin's wife, Zhou, then stood up and said briefly that since her husband's tragic death, she had been in unbearable pain. Foreigners had cruelly killed her husband, leaving her helpless. She is currently pregnant and will be giving birth soon. Although she does not know whether it will be a boy or a girl, she does not know how she, a widow, will raise the child. The future is bleak. Therefore, since others killed her husband, she must achieve the goal of punishing the murderer in order to let her late husband rest in peace. Secondly, her livelihood has been left unresolved, and she hopes that everyone will uphold justice and actively help, as she feels a life and death connection with everyone. It was then decided that: (1) Secret. (2) Xin Dingxiang's father, Xin Hesheng, must not negotiate with the other party alone, and everything must be resolved by the Support Association. (3) Expand the Support Association's organization: A. Increase the committee to 21 organizations, B. Print and distribute leaflets, C. Establish a speaking team. (4) Decide to add the following thirteen organizations to the Support Association committee: Citizens' Federation, Pharmacy Industry Workers' Union, Postal Workers' Union, China Merchants Bureau Fifth Wharf Workers' Union, Huining Sojourners Association, Calligraphy and Fan Workers' Union, French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union, Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Chinese and Foreign Cloth Industry Workers' Union, Huacheng Tobacco Factory Workers' Union, Tea Industry Workers' Union, Sanyou Industrial Co. Workers' Union, and Steamboat Wood Industry Workers' Union. (5) Resolved to send five representatives to petition the municipal government. Cai Xiaohe, Wang Changyuan, Hu Bihang, Wang Yongliang, and Zhang Shenzhi were elected as representatives. (6) Send a letter to Du Yuesheng, a Chinese director of the French Concession and chairman of the Chinese Directors Association, requesting him to uphold justice and promptly negotiate seriously with the French authorities to achieve the goals. The original letter is recorded below. To: Du Yuesheng, Dear Sir, Xin Dingxiang, a sampanman, was beaten and drowned by a sailor from the French Navy's warship Walter Kochsha for demanding ferry fare. Since the incident occurred, more than a month has passed. Due to the obstruction of unequal treaties, although our association has been running around and appealing, the other party has not shown any remorse or sincerity in resolving the matter. The grievance has not been redressed, and the people's feelings are indignant. You, sir, are a Chinese director of the French Municipal Council, a leader of the merchants, and your chivalrous reputation has long been known far and wide. You must have deep sympathy for this tragedy. Xin Dingxiang's father is old and his family is poor, and his pregnant wife has suffered a tragic death, leaving them destitute. Deliberating the circumstances, they are truly pitiful. The murderer is still at large, which is deeply hateful. We respectfully ask you, sir, to uphold your long-standing ambition to suppress the strong and support the weak, to advocate for justice and fairness, and to promptly negotiate seriously to achieve the desired goals, so that a satisfactory resolution can be reached. The rights of the nation are deeply reliant on this. Please consider and respond to this. Respectfully, The Xin Case Support Association.</p>
<h3>Yancheng Woman Kidnapped and Brought to Shanghai by Bandits</h3>
<p>Raped and Taken as Wife</p>
<p>Two Bandits Simultaneously Detained</p>
<p>A woman named Wang Xiaomei from Yancheng was kidnapped for ransom by Ma Yuren's subordinates in August of the lunar calendar this year. Her family did not care because they had no money to redeem her. On October 1st, the bandits Chen Zhaotai and Liu Guren abducted Wang and brought her to Shanghai, residing on Hanzhong Road in Zhabei, where they raped and occupied her. Yesterday, the hostage Wang Xiaomei took advantage of the fact that nobody was guarding her during Liu's wedding and escaped to her uncle's house, where she reported the case to the police, who arrested the two bandits Chen and Liu and detained them in the Fourth District Public Security Bureau of Zhabei. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Kidnapping for Ransom: Wang Xiaomei, 23 years old, originally lived in Yancheng. This year, due to Ma Yuren's rebellion in Jiangbei, she took refuge in Shagou City. On August 17th of the lunar calendar, Ma's bandits again robbed in Shagou, gathering more than 2,000 people, robbing houses and looting shops, and kidnapping hundreds of women, including Wang Xiaomei. She was taken away by the bandits Chen Zhaoxiong and Liu Guren, who sent a letter to her family demanding 1,000 yuan for ransom. Wang's family was destitute and unable to raise the money, so they had to let it go. On October 1st, Chen and Liu took the stolen furniture and other items with Wang Xiaomei to Shanghai, first residing in Tangjiawan, Ximen, and later moving to No. 51 Hanzhong Li, Hanzhong Road, Zhabei. Chen Zhaoxiong also raped Wang Xiaomei and took her as his wife.</p>
<p>Escaping During the Opportunity: Liu Zhaoxiong, 29 years old, was not yet married. Yesterday was an auspicious day for him to marry his child bride, Chen. His family was quite busy, so no one paid attention to Wang Xiaomei's actions. Before lunch, Wang Xiaomei took advantage of the opportunity while emptying the chamber pot to escape secretly and go to her uncle Wang Yaoting's house, where she told him about being abducted and raped. He immediately reported to the police, who arrested Chen Zhaoxiong and Liu Guren, along with suspects Gu Kegang and Zhao Deji, and detained them in the Fourth District Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Strict Handling by the Bureau: After arriving at the bureau, Wang Xiaomei recounted the details of being kidnapped and abducted. When questioned, the defendant Chen Zhaoxiong denied the incident, claiming that he was a soldier under Ma Yuren for eight months and was ordered to rob and kidnap people in Shagou. He met Wang Xiaomei on the boat but did not demand ransom or rape her. Liu Guren stated that he did not know Chen Zhaoxiong and only met him on a boat in Dongtai on September 9th of the lunar calendar. He did not rob or kidnap any women. Since Wang Xiaomei had no place to live, he invited her to stay at his house temporarily. Suspect Gu Kegang stated that Liu Guren was the nephew of his wife's ex-husband, and he brought Chen Zhaoxiong and Wang Xiaomei to live in Shanghai. He did not know that they were bandits. According to the household registration police report, Chen and Liu moved from Tangjiawan to Hanzhong Road, Zhabei on November 15. The householder was Meng Bugao. Chen Zhaoxiong was Meng's cousin, and Liu was the householder's brother-in-law. His wife was Wang. After verifying the statements, District Chief Jin determined that the two bandits Chen and Liu were guilty of kidnapping and raping women, and the crimes were heinous. He ordered them to be sent to the judicial section for strict handling.</p>
<h3>Tragedy Under Car Wheels</h3>
<p>One Dead, Two Injured</p>
<p>Rickshaw Puller Loses Both Legs: A certain Westerner residing on Jiangwan Road employed a rickshaw puller named Gu Luping, 25 years old. Last night at 7:30 PM, his employer instructed him to take a guest to the ball field entrance on Nanjing Road. Upon reaching the destination, the guest alighted and departed. Gu then pulled his empty rickshaw to return. Not far along, another guest loudly hailed a rickshaw to the shooting range. Gu, thinking it was a convenient route home, and why not earn a little extra money, greeted him with a smile. He carried the guest speeding north. Who knew that good things often have setbacks? While traveling on Laobazi Road north of Sichuan Road, there were several cars ahead winding like long snakes. Unexpectedly, a public bus, driven by a Russian driver of the number 340, came from behind. The Russian, excessively drunk, drove erratically, ignoring everything. He charged straight ahead, and with a loud crash, a major disaster occurred. Gu's rickshaw was struck onto the curb. Fortunately, the passenger was alert, leaped down, and escaped unharmed, suffering only minor abrasions. The rickshaw puller, Gu Luping, fell to the ground, breaking both legs. A car parked on the side of the road suffered minor damage to its front. Two other rickshaws were also affected. As for the struck rickshaw, it was smashed to bits and beyond repair. Seeing the disaster he had caused, the Russian driver stepped on the gas and fled. Officer number 1053 blew his whistle frantically, summoning nearby officers to intercept him. Initially, the Russian looked fierce, as if to punch the officer, but as onlookers gathered and shouted, he dared not make a sound. The officer recorded the number, and the car was allowed to proceed. The injured were taken to Tongren Hospital.</p>
<p>Old Woman Bloodied Beyond Recognition: An old woman from Jiangbei, Yang Wen, over sixty years of age, residing in a bungalow on Baoxing Road, Zhabei, intended to go to the Nan Shi 16 Pu last evening around 6:00 PM to take a boat back to her hometown. She had just reached the entrance of the park on the Outer White Bridge when a public bus driven by a Russian driver came towards her. Due to her age and frailty, she could not avoid it and was knocked to the ground. The wheel ran over her body, breaking her skull. She was bloodied beyond recognition, a horrifying sight. Officer number 1229, hearing the alarm, arrived at the scene and had the injured woman taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, her injuries were too severe, and she died half an hour after arriving.</p>
<p>Apprentice Severely Injured: Sun Xizhen, a police officer of the second squad of the sixth district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, received a report around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday that a student, about fifteen or sixteen years old, riding a bicycle on the Puxi Road of Xujiahui, west of Shanghai, in front of the Yuantai Rice Shop at number 22, traveling south, was suddenly struck from behind by a business car with municipal license number 4177, causing a head injury. The injury was quite severe. Officer Sun rushed to the scene and took the person and car involved to the station. Director Liu then dispatched Inspector Yuan to inspect the scene of the accident. At the time, a rickshaw was passing on the injured person's left. The road was narrow, and it bumped the bicycle, causing the person and bicycle to fall to the right. The car that caused the accident came along shortly after and, because it was traveling too fast, could not brake in time, causing a head injury and a fracture of the zygomatic bone on the left temple. The victim could not speak. At the time, a car was hired to take the injured person to the Red Cross for treatment on Haig Road, and witness Xia Guangxin was taken to the station for questioning. According to the car driver, Zhu Shangfu, 34 years old, from Ningbo, was a driver for the Billem Motor Company on Broadway. He had been there for less than two months and had not yet obtained a Chinese license. Today, he was driving a municipal license number 4177 car to the Catholic Church to drop off a guest. When he arrived in front of number 22 Puxi Road, a student riding a bicycle in front of him, for some reason, fell to the right. Because the bicycle was so close, he could not stop in time, causing the student's head to be injured. According to witness Xia Guangxin, from Huizhou, the situation at the time of the accident was not clear. However, he saw the injured student being dragged from under the car wheels. Afterward, he helped the police officer take him to the hospital. The rest he did not know. Shortly afterward, the injured person's brother-in-law, Shu Changshun, came to the station, claiming to be from Ningbo, currently residing at number 1 Yipin Lane, Bailinan Road. The injured person's name was Chen Shouchun, 15 years old, my younger cousin, currently studying at Xujiahui Public School at the Catholic Church. His parents are both in his hometown. As for what to do, I cannot make a decision. I must wait for my parents-in-law to come to Shanghai. Director Liu then prepared a document sending the car driver Zhu Shangfu, witness Xia Guangxin, along with car number 4177, to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Meeting on Dog Racing Issue</h3>
<p>Results Unknown</p>
<p>The Mainland Daily reported that yesterday (24th) afternoon, the meeting location for the Municipal Council directors and dog racing venue staff lawyers was the Municipal Council, not the British Consulate General. Yesterday, the reporter visited British Consul General Brannan and asked about the meeting's outcome. Brannan said he did not attend the meeting nor receive a report on the meeting. The claim in a certain newspaper that the meeting was at the British Consulate was false. Afterward, the reporter inquired in all directions within the Municipal Council about the meeting's outcome, but could not obtain definitive information. It was heard that the dog racing venue shareholders petitioned the Municipal Council to keep the resolution secret temporarily to avoid losses for the shareholders on the Western Stock Exchange.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke and Chen Mingshu Host Banquet for Guangdong Merchants in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Last Night at Xing Hua Lou</p>
<p>Railway Minister Sun Ke and Guangdong Province Chairman Chen Mingshu hosted a banquet last night at the Xing Hua Lou on Fuzhou Road in this city for military and political figures and prominent Guangdong merchants in Shanghai. Over a hundred people attended, including Central Committee members Wu Tiecheng, Shi Qingyang, Sun Ke, Chen Mingshu, Tang Shaochuan, Guangdong Navy Commander Chen Ce, Shanghai Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, etc. The banquet was to raise funds for the construction of the Guangdong Foshan to Zhongshan Port railway. It is planned to be a joint government-business venture. Government shares have been designated from the British Boxer Indemnity. Business shares have not yet been raised. Therefore, Chen and Sun hosted a banquet for Guangdong merchants in Shanghai to proceed together. During the banquet, Chen Mingshu, Sun Ke, Tang Shaochuan, and others gave speeches.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Works Bureau to Issue New Small Car Licenses</h3>

<h3>Airplanes Assist Water Police in Suppressing Pirates Outside Wusong Port</h3>
<p>Pirates outside Wusong Port have become rampant. Recently, there was a fight between pirate leaders, such that pirates can be found almost everywhere on the seas. Zhang Han, the director of the fourth district of the Wusong Water Police, has repeatedly ordered the 16th, 17th, and 18th squads under his command to search and suppress them. However, because the coastal areas outside the port are mostly remote, with numerous harbors, and shifting sands appear and disappear unpredictably, suppression is difficult to achieve. Therefore, the pirates have not been completely suppressed to this day. The day before yesterday, Director Zhang, together with the county magistrates of Tongzhou, Chongming, Hai'an, and Qidong counties, held a meeting and decided to request the Civil Affairs Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government to forward a request to the Central Government to quickly dispatch airplanes to assist in the suppression so that the pirates can be suppressed as soon as possible to avoid future troubles. It is learned that the Central Government has approved the request, and airplanes will be dispatched to assist in the suppression in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Yang Chenqing Case: Ordered to Summon Lu Shijun for Further Questioning</h3>
<p>Lu Shijun, an editor at the Beixin Bookstore, and Yang Chenqing, a female employee at the American Bookstore, fell in love. After Yang became pregnant, he abandoned her. Yang then sued Lu for enticement in the Special District Court. Later, Yang was at the end of her pregnancy and went to the hospital to give birth, so the case was postponed. The case was continued yesterday afternoon, and the defendant was still absent. Judge Feng then summoned witness Chen Wei, who stated that Lu Shijun and Yang had disagreements when Lu was studying at the Political Science and Law College. One day, I went to the college to try to mediate, but Lu had returned home to Rihui Lane, so I went to his house. Lu and Yang were arguing, and I advised them. Lu said that he was still in school, and his father would have to decide on marriage. I then pleaded on their behalf to his father, Mianru, who said that he could discuss marriage in February. Later, Yang requested Lu to pay alimony from February, but Lu said that he was in school and could not afford it. However, Lu later gave me 20 yuan to give to Ms. Yang. In early November, he asked me to give her another 10 yuan. Afterward, Lu's father did not discuss marriage, so it was put aside. Judge Feng then ordered the case to be postponed and ordered the Wuxi County Court to summon Lu Shijun to court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Nephew Extorts Aunt</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Two Years in Prison</p>
<p>Chen Liang from Ningbo repeatedly borrowed money from his aunt, Chen Zhao, who was a nurse at the Municipal Council Hospital on Feilun Road. Recently, he sent a letter requesting to borrow 80 yuan, which was unreasonable, and said that if she refused, he would use a pistol against her. She reported it to the police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Chen and bring him to the Special District Court for questioning. The matter was previously reported in this newspaper. The trial continued yesterday morning. The plaintiff reiterated her nephew's misconduct and possession of a pistol, and said that the defendant's father in his hometown also hated his son's illegal actions and should be severely punished. Chen Liang still claimed that the letter was written under the influence of alcohol. After the trial, Judge Ge sentenced the defendant to two years in prison and confiscated the threatening letter.</p>
<h3>Brawl at Tanhuang Theater</h3>
<p>Firearms Found in Kitchen</p>
<p>A tanhuang theater was located at number 10 Kunming Road. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, a brawl broke out. The Huishan Police Station in charge received a report and dispatched detectives to investigate, but the ringleader had already fled. Only Mao A'gen, Zhu Liangfa, and Yang A'hua were apprehended. Two pistols, two bullets, and two wooden sticks were found in the kitchen. They were taken to the Special District Court for questioning yesterday. According to Mao A'gen, he worked as a tea server. The theater owner, A'xiang, had a dispute with a gangster named Xiao Bu'mei. Zhu and Yang both said that they were listening to tanhuang in the theater and were mistakenly arrested. Judge Ge ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and postponed the trial for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Ji Changquan, Accused of Abducting a Woman, Sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Li, the wife of Wang Shaorong from Hubei, was only nineteen years old, married for five years, and had not yet given birth. Suddenly, on March 16th of this year, she left her husband and fled with several sets of clothes. Wang's family lived at number 119 Julu Road, and besides reporting it to the police station in charge, he entrusted the Chinese police officer number 2364 at the Gordon Road Police Station to keep an eye out for her because he knew him well. Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, the Chinese police officer was patrolling Kangnaught Road when he saw Li and a man passing by with a suitcase. He arrested them both and took them to the police station. The man's name was Ji Changquan, from Jiangbei, who used to perform in Jiangbei theaters. He was sent to the Special District Court yesterday, and Judge Sun Yuan questioned him. According to the police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, the defendant, Ji Changquan, planned to abduct Li to Jiangbei to sell her. He is accused of enticement and should be tried. According to Li, she was previously enticed by her husband's friend, Guo Xiang, and a woman who came to my house and sent me to Ji's house, where I have been hiding until now. Ji stated that when he was performing at the Dingxin Theater at Hujia Wooden Bridge, Li and Guo Xiang often went to the theater to watch the performance and played in the backstage. That is how they met. Li said that her husband was dead, and she liked me and wanted to go to Jiangbei with me, so I was going to take her back to her hometown yesterday. The Municipal Public Security Bureau believed that the case occurred in the Chinese territory and specifically prepared a document and sent personnel to the court to request a transfer. Judge Sun approved the request and sent the defendant Ji Changquan to the staff to take him back for further investigation. Li was taken back by her husband.</p>
<h3>He Gengxing Continues to be Accused</h3>
<p>He Gengxing, the comprador of Mitsui &amp; Co., deserted his post in May, owing no less than a million in debt. Mitsui &amp; Co. has filed criminal and civil lawsuits in the Special District Court. Previously reported, Hengyu, Heng Laoyuan Ji, Chengyu Shen Ji, Zhichengxin Ji, Yichang Shen Ji, Henglong, Xinfu, Tongyu, Jiufeng, and other nine money shops and Zhengda Bank jointly hired lawyers Chen Zhongyin and Wang to also accuse He Gengxing of colluding to defraud. The defendants, in addition to He, are his brother, He Junxing, manager of Tian'an, Ma Changjia, accountant of Hongyu, Jin Youcheng, owner of the China Rubber Company, and Jin Youzhang, owner of the San Yi Printing House. According to the plaintiff's complaint, He Gengxing, in addition to opening Hongyu and Huiyu Hardware Stores, also jointly and solely owned Yuyuan Money Shop, Tian'an Rubber Company, Qianxun Pawnshop, and Shou Xing Real Estate Company. Hongyu and Huiyu had overdraft transactions with the plaintiffs. On May 24, He Gengxing and Ma Changjia absconded with funds, owing the plaintiffs a large sum. They made arrangements in advance and filed for bankruptcy with the French Consulate, which appointed an accountant to liquidate. When the plaintiffs checked the accounts, the Hongyu ledger contained an entry on May 23 stating that 150,000 taels of gold were received from Youji and 150,000 taels were paid to He Gengxing, and the handwriting was altered. Upon closer inspection, the "Geng" character was changed from "Shou." When checking He Gengxing's account, there was also such a record, and other accounts were also inconsistent. They requested that the defendants be brought to trial and ordered to repay the funds. Judge Chu Tingqi summoned the defendants yesterday afternoon, but only Jin Youzhang and Jin Youcheng arrived. The other three, He Gengxing, etc., did not appear and submitted a petition requesting a postponement to prepare their defense. Judge Wu then postponed the trial to December 6th.</p>
<h3>Zhao Guangzu Unwilling to Divorce</h3>
<p>Files a Plea with the Special District Court</p>
<p>After Zhao Tan Meiying filed a petition for divorce from Zhao Guangzu with the Special District Court, it was heard that Zhao Guangzu had filed a plea with the Special District Court, hoping for reconciliation. The plea is recorded as follows: "Civil Plea Document." Pleader: Zhao Guangzu, Agent: Lawyer Gao Shuo, Plaintiff: Zhao Tan Meiying. Regarding the case of Zhao Tan Meiying's lawsuit for divorce, the occurrence of this case is directly a misfortune for the family and indirectly an impact on society. The trial was hastily conducted the other day, and a declaration of the conclusion of the debate was made. Fearing that the lower circumstances could not be conveyed to the higher authorities, I will add additional reasons. The plea is as follows: (1) The doctor's certificate is not credible. Upon inspection, there was no quarreling that day, how could there be beating? If it happened, the plaintiff would have deliberately filed a lawsuit and could have directly reported the arrest, how could she calmly seek medical treatment? Furthermore, according to the doctor's rules, a blank form is used to create a medical certificate, how can a random letter of stationery be used for proof? (2) The witness Gao is bribed. The defendant had stated that the Gao Zhang called by the plaintiff to the court had repeatedly wanted to quit and refused to testify. The court did not adopt this but still ordered the witness to appear and state. When Gao Zhang first stated, she said that she heard them arguing and did not remember whether they hit each other. The plaintiff was standing nearby at that time and scolded the witness. The presiding judge of the court made a remark of reprimand. Afterward, the witness complied with the plaintiff's wishes and made a statement, which clearly shows that the witness was bribed and cannot be used as evidence. (3) The two letters are casual writings between husband and wife and were before the Meifei case was filed. The defendant had previously been in love with Meifei, and there were often quarrels between husband and wife, so there were casual writings on May 12, 7, and 18. After the plaintiff came forward to file a lawsuit (in late July) and the relationship with Meifei was severed, the defendant never had any licentious facts. If the plaintiff wanted to break away from the husband-wife relationship with the defendant, why did she come forward to tell about Meifei's matter? The defendant has obeyed, changed his ways, and corrected his mistakes. How can the plaintiff take the facts from the past as a reason for divorce? It is important to investigate the key to this case. (1) Were the previous two divorce letters before or after the plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Meifei? (2) Is the defendant still involved in flirtatious activities, so as to estimate whether there is a basis for divorce? As for casual writings between husband and wife, there are constant things that are not enough to be believed. On October 4 of this year, the plaintiff also had a handwritten letter stating, "If Guangzu has an accident, Meiying is willing to use a glass coffin worth 750 taels to collect Guangzu." The original letter is also attached. If so, can the defendant be accused of inciting suicide against the plaintiff? These casual writings are originally absurd matters of the boudoir and are not sufficient to provide evidence in court. (4) The witness should be added. Upon investigation, the organization of the defendant's family is not as simple as the plaintiff described. There is also brother Zhao Guangde living in the same family. Instead of taking evidence from ignorant and illiterate maids who are easily bribed, it is better to interview co-residents and neighbors to get the truth. The defendant previously requested in court that fear of language barriers not be granted. I hereby apply for additional transmission to show fairness. In general, the world is getting worse, etiquette is sinking, and young men and women are often easily tempted by the outside world. After the defendant was sued by the plaintiff for the Meifei case, he was deeply motivated and wished to make amends, abandon evil and return to righteousness, and be kind and loving to each other for a long-term marriage. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff suddenly had a different intention and changed her original intention, which is a great misfortune in life. If what the plaintiff accuses is a recent fact, then there is still a reason for returning, but it is self-inflicted. The only thing is the past, which is the fact before the defendant repented (the matter before the plaintiff sued Meifei). It is not right for the plaintiff to change her mind and it is a manifestation of the instability of young people's minds. According to Article 677 of the Civil Procedure Law, in a lawsuit for divorce and a lawsuit for husband and wife to live together, the court shall advise reconciliation at any time during the oral debate. Article 678 of the Civil Procedure Law states that in a lawsuit for divorce and a lawsuit for husband and wife to live together, if the court believes that the parties have hope of harmony, it may order the suspension of the proceedings for a period of up to one year, but only once, etc. The plaintiff in this case does not have very important facts that cannot be cohabitated with the defendant, and the facts are all previous events of the defendant. The plaintiff and the defendant have both admitted that they regret their previous actions, so they jointly sued Meifei for fraud in late July of this year. The plaintiff is the plaintiff in the case, and the defendant is the witness in the case. There is a case to be checked. Now, the plaintiff raises the past for no reason, which is not contradictory. It must be seduced or for a moment of anger. I beg your court to allow a re-hearing and order a limited time to try to reconcile in order to restore the marriage and maintain ethics. The defendant's two brothers share property, and the defendant's common copper seal are in the plaintiff's possession. I should ask that it be ordered to be temporarily handed over to prevent accidents. Combined statement, respectfully to the Shanghai Special District Court. Witness Zhao Guangde, 17 years old, Shanghai, resident of the residence at No. 1100 Huade Road, student, neighbor surnamed Yao, resident of No. 320 Huade Road, former co-resident.</p>
<h3>Concealing a Woman from a Good Family</h3>
<p>Failure to Succeed and Extortion of Money</p>
<p>Yu A'si from Jiading, fourteen years old, was given to the Li family from the same village as a daughter when she was young, named Yue Bao. A'si is quite beautiful and dresses similarly to a female student in the inland. Her father's name is Mengfu, and he is a local guard in his hometown. Her grandfather, A'chun, works in the Caojiadu Fire Brigade in this city. Recently, her neighbor, Aunt Zhang Zhao, is blind and came to Shanghai for medical treatment accompanied by her son, Guohua. A'si admired the prosperous markets of Shanghai and had never been there before. Taking advantage of this opportunity, she also came to Shanghai and stayed at the Huian Hotel on Zhejiang Road. By chance, Li Kou and Qu Longchang from Tongzhou had worked as partners in a Jiading rosewood workshop, so they knew Zhang. By chance, they met Zhang on the road and, after exchanging greetings, gathered at the hotel to talk. Li and Qu saw that A'si was very beautiful and had malicious intentions. They pretended to go to Caojiadu to find her grandfather, using the opportunity to entice A'si to a bungalow near the San Wan Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong. A'si saw that the place she arrived at was not like the fire brigade and that her grandfather was never seen, so she knew that Li and Qu were not well-intentioned and covered her face and cried. A police officer saw this and asked questions. Li and Qu saw that things were not going well and slipped away. A'si was taken to the Third District Police Station by the police. After the district chief understood the reason, he ordered her to stay in the district temporarily and wait for her family to claim her. Li and Qu saw that their plan had failed and were frustrated. However, they were unwilling to give up, so they planned to have Qu return to Pudong alone and contact Zhang Guohua, demanding 150 yuan to return the person. Zhang was suffering from the loss of A'si and became even more angry when he heard this. He twisted Qu to the French Concession Police Station and requested that A'si be recovered. Qu confessed that A'si was hidden in Pudong by them. The police station ruled that the case occurred in the Chinese territory and transferred the plaintiff and defendant to the first division of the second district. After questioning by the director, it was ruled that Qu concealed a woman from a good family, failed, and tried to extort money. His crime was inescapable, so he was ordered to be sent to the General Bureau for disposal. After this case occurred, it was reported in the newspaper yesterday. A'si's grandfather, Qian A'chun, read it and came to Pudong yesterday to report to the third district, confirming that A'si was his granddaughter. At the same time, the district chief ruled that the principal offender of the abduction had surrendered himself and was now detained at the General Bureau awaiting investigation, so he also sent the grandfather and granddaughter to the bureau for joint interrogation.</p>
<h3>Warden Sentenced and Appeals</h3>
<p>Zhang Hong, the warden of the Jiading County Government Detention Center, had released prisoners and accepted bribes. He was dismissed by the Jiangsu Higher Court. After opening a court investigation result by Jiading County Government, he was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. Zhang refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Shanghai Local Court. The approval was granted yesterday. The Jiading County Government sent police to escort him to the Local Court, where the prosecutor ordered him to be detained pending a hearing by the Criminal Collegiate Bench.</p>
<h3>Yan Hongde and Zhang Clash, Accusing Each Other</h3>
<p>Involving Schoolteacher Yang Shuhui</p>
<p>Yan Hongde, a 35-year-old man from Yangzhou, resides at No. 3273, Yaozu Lane, Wuzhou Road, Youheng Road, Hongkou East. He used to work as a foreman. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, he married Zhang Jinbiao's younger sister, Zhang, from Gaoyou, as his concubine. The following year, they had a daughter named Suzhen, who is now ten years old. Initially, they lived separately in Yongkang Lane, Hujia Wood Bridge. Later, Zhang's brother, Zhang Jinbiao, sued Yan in the local court, accusing him of bigamy. However, Zhang appeared in court and stated that what was done was done and she willingly retreated to the position of concubine, leading to the withdrawal of the case. They lived peacefully without incident. At the beginning of this month, Yan Hongde hired lawyer Fan Ming to file a private prosecution in the criminal division of the local court, stating that his concubine, Zhang, was secretly associating with Yang Shuhui, a schoolteacher living nearby. He saw that Zhang was outwardly attentive, so he suspected nothing. The year before last, Zhang asked to move back home, but Yan was afraid that his wife and concubine living together would be inappropriate, so he refused. Subsequently, Zhang repeatedly pleaded, so he moved back home last year. Until now, the relationship between the wife and concubine has been harmonious. Unexpectedly, Zhang secretly associated with Yang Shuhui. Although the neighbors knew, they kept it secret. Zhang's intentions were insidious. She gradually moved out of the house a total of 480 silver dollars in savings and clothing, etc. On the second of this month, Zhang used the excuse of going out to join a rotating credit association and never returned. After Yan discovered this, he checked the clothes and found nothing left. Only then did friends tell him the truth. Yan went to Yongkang Lane, where Yang Shuhui lived, to inquire. According to the neighbors, he had already moved to Tianbao Road, Xiangyan Bridge, and was living with someone named Shen. Yan went to the address to inquire. The neighbors all knew that a woman and a young girl were living in the house with Yang, coming and going together. Zhang absconded with the money and took the girl with her. Her intentions were clever and her methods were too ruthless. After more than ten years as husband and wife, this is the result. If he were to tolerate this and not speak out, how would the good customs of society be maintained? Therefore, he filed the lawsuit. Zhang, hired lawyer Jiang Rong to send a letter to Yan Hongde, stating that she had left home to live elsewhere because she could not stand the abuse, and intended to sever the relationship, requesting a compensation of 1,000 silver dollars, and 1,400 silver dollars for the girl's education, etc. This case was summoned for trial, but only the plaintiff appeared in court. As a result, the private prosecution was rejected and the case was transferred to the prosecutor's office for investigation and handling. A few days ago, the police station of the Fifth District, Second Precinct arrested Yan Zhang and Yang Shuhui one after another and transferred them to the detective team. The team sent Zhang to the Third Section, which transferred her to the local court for interrogation. After the interrogation, she was ordered to return and await instructions. Now, Yan Hongde has submitted a supplementary lawsuit to the court, stating that the defendant Yang Shuhui is currently being detained by the detective team, and that Yan Zhang (28 years old) has been detained by the detective team and brought to the court. He requested that the case be strictly investigated, and also filed a civil suit, seeking a public prosecution to investigate the stolen clothing, silver dollars, and the girl's matter. This case was filed on the eighth of this month. The court ruled on the thirteenth of this month to reject it, notifying the prosecutor's office, stating that it had already been reported. He received a summons from the prosecutor of the court yesterday, scheduling a hearing (today) for legal interrogation. After Zhang was seduced by Yang Shuhui into adultery, Zhang became restless. Starting in February of this year, she instigated Zhang to tell him that she wanted to borrow several hundred silver dollars, otherwise she would threaten him with a pistol. Then she encouraged Zhang to move back home, so that she could take the opportunity to steal property. Because he was employed by others, leaving early and returning late, he had no way of knowing. On the third of this month, Zhang left and did not return, and all the clothes were stolen. Afterwards, someone witnessed Yang Shuhui and Zhang talking privately, which was not the first time. From this, clues could be found. At that time, in addition to reporting to the Public Security Bureau's detective team for investigation, he also filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting the police to arrest them for investigation. Since the private prosecution has been rejected, he pleads directly to the prosecutor's office to investigate according to the law, file a public prosecution, and strictly punish them.</p>
<h3>Third Call for Funds for Shangyu Embankment Project</h3>
<p>The Shangyu embankment project, which has been underway for some time since fellow villagers in Shanghai raised funds to start construction, requires approximately 80,000 yuan in labor and materials. The amount of donations received is not substantial, and the banks of the Cao'e River have recently collapsed again. If no measures are taken to repair them, the flood will be severe. Therefore, a third letter of solicitation was issued. The letter states: "We are writing to inform you that this embankment project relies entirely on the initiating gentlemen who gathered comrades, made great vows, and started construction. The estimated cost of labor and materials is approximately 80,000 yuan. It was agreed to raise funds separately and proceed. Recently, the embankment project has begun, and funds are urgently needed like stars in the night sky. The total amount of donations received is only over 30,000 yuan, which is far from sufficient. If it is interrupted midway, it will be more dangerous than the original earthen embankment. Thinking of this, we cannot sleep or eat in peace. We can only ask you again to make every effort to find a way, either to donate generously or to raise funds widely, to meet the urgent needs, so that we can take advantage of this winter season when the tides are smaller to complete the project. This is our sincere prayer." (The rest is omitted)</p>

<h3>Land Without People</h3>
<p>Where does the opium come from?</p>
<p>Let's send the stolen goods to the bureau</p>
<p>Fu Jixiang, patrol captain of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Water Patrol Team, and detectives Liu Changrui and Yang Chunting, while patrolling the river near the Datong Wharf at around 12:00 noon yesterday, noticed the Hua'an steamship docked there. They immediately boarded the ship to conduct an inspection. They then went to the steerage section of the ship and found a bag in the luggage of a recruit of the 56th Division of the National Revolutionary Army. Upon inspection, they found three packages of opium, totaling more than sixty taels, and an iron box containing eleven opium pills and a box of opium paste. After inquiring, no one claimed ownership. So they took the team away. Later, Wang Shenwu, a platoon leader of the division, surrendered to the team. When Xu, the chief of the team, questioned him, he said that more than 500 recruits had been recruited this time and were traveling to Shanghai on the ship before transferring to Fujian Province. He did not know who brought the opium. He ordered that a report be prepared with the seized evidence and submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for review and handling.</p>

<h3>Tao Dongfu's Tragic Death is Pitiful</h3>
<p>Tao Dongfu, a 53-year-old man from Nanjing, worked as a foreman at the Shunchang copper shop on Jinlong Street in the Public Concession. On the afternoon of the 22nd, he went to a copper shop near Xiaonanmen to pick up a basket of copperware to bring back to the shop. At 5:50 p.m., while heading north on Zilai Street in the French Concession towards Avenue Edward VII, he was struck by a car driven by a driver from the Tan Le Motor Company (license number 7827). Tao was unable to avoid it and was knocked down by the car's rear fender, suffering head injuries. The police who arrived at the scene recorded the license number and sent Tao to Renji Hospital. They then returned to the police station to report to the head of the police. Tao died from his injuries without effective treatment at 11:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. The hospital notified the police station, and the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall autopsy room to await examination. Because the name and address of Tao were unknown at the time, it was impossible to find his family. Yesterday, the Vehicle Department of the French Police Station reported to Judge Zhu of the French Court, who came to the scene and confirmed that the deceased had died from injuries sustained in a car accident. He ordered that photos be taken and the body be kept by the court, pending identification by family members. The defendant driver was released on bail. If no family members come forward within six months, the case will be dismissed. Later, the deceased's companions identified the body at the autopsy room and notified the family to collect it. It is reported that the deceased had parents, a wife, and children who depended on him for support. Now that he has suffered this tragic misfortune, the family's livelihood will be difficult from now on.</p>

<h3>National Tongji University President Hu Shuhua Resubmits Resignation</h3>
<p>President Hu Shuhua of National Tongji University previously resigned from his post due to financial difficulties, but the Ministry of Education retained him. Now, because the school is extremely difficult to maintain, he has resubmitted his resignation to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education. His original submission states:</p>
<p>Submitted for the purpose of explaining the difficult situation, requesting review and approval of resignation. I, Shuhua, was honored to be appointed to the position of president more than a year ago. Recalling the beginning of my appointment, I privately wished to devote all my energy to the task, in order to live up to the Party and the country's intention to cultivate talent. However, in recent years, funding has been exhausted, coupled with the school's unique history, and the difficulties have been great. Only 30% to 40% of my efforts have been devoted to academic achievements, while 60% to 70% of my energy has been spent on dealing with requests for payment. I am worried day and night. I feel that I can no longer help with the difficulties, and I should give way to a more capable person to avoid making mistakes. At the beginning of this academic year, I repeatedly submitted my resignation, but it was not approved. I勉力 support until now, but the difficulties have doubled. I would like to present the current situation of the school in detail, respectfully requesting your review. The school was founded by Germans. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, it was taken over and run independently. Until the spring of the sixteenth year, it was affected by military events, and the school lacked leadership. It relied on borrowing to survive. In addition, the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office stopped issuing subsidies in the winter of the seventeenth year. By the time Shuhua arrived at the school on June 20th of the eighteenth year and took over, there were already heavy debts and a towering debt. It is estimated that it owed German commercial groups and Puel Yangxing and other loans, totaling 118,400 silver dollars, unpaid salaries to German teachers and staff of 73,900 silver dollars, and overdrafts from banks of 30,000 silver dollars, totaling more than 220,000 silver dollars. The school has no foundation or assets to draw on. Although efforts have been made to reorganize, there is no way to make up for the huge losses. Moreover, the school has a special situation that is very different from other schools. The professors are all Germans, and they are full-time teachers with many teaching hours, so their salaries are higher than normal. The medical and engineering departments both place a heavy emphasis on practical training, which is very costly. The monthly expenses are 34,725 silver dollars. The salaries of teachers and staff in the university, middle school, and affiliated mechanic school total more than 21,000 silver dollars. The factory, the anatomy research institute, and the physiology research institute spend approximately 5,600 silver dollars on practical training. Equipment and administrative expenses are only 7,900 silver dollars. Therefore, monthly expenses always exceed the budget. Efforts are made to make ends meet. In the eighteenth year, more than 70,000 silver dollars of old bonds were sold, and more than 20,000 silver dollars were saved from regular expenses, so a total of 53,000 silver dollars were used to repay old debts and interest. A high-voltage electricity testing laboratory and a cast iron chemical testing laboratory were built for the practical training needs of the engineering school. The physiology research institute of the medical school had been planned for several years. It was only at the beginning of this year that funds were allocated, and with the support of the Cultural Foundation Committee, the building was fortunately completed. However, all the internal equipment is still empty. As for the establishment of a science school to complete the university organization, although it has been approved, there is no way to raise funds. Although Baolong Hospital is a place for students to practice, it is not a long-term solution to live under someone else's roof. Therefore, it seems that a teaching hospital should be established on its own. Most of the medical school teachers work at Baolong Hospital. Although they do not receive salaries for teaching, their sense of responsibility is also reduced. Therefore, in the nineteenth year's budget, Shuhua requested that all medical school teachers be paid a salary. Now, the funds received are still based on the seventeenth year's budget. All kinds of improvement plans have become bubbles. Now, since the beginning of this year, five months have passed, and only 10,000 silver dollars have been issued for July's expenses. Previously, due to the sharp fall in silver prices and the surge in marks, it has been approved to subsidize German professors a total of 3,720 silver dollars per month, but only July and August have been paid. Therefore, German professors are dissatisfied because old debts have not been repaid and new debts have increased. At first, they complained, but recently they have questioned harshly. These professors all signed contracts for several years when they came to China, so they brought their families and stayed here. Once their salaries are in arrears, it is difficult for them to maintain their lives. This is also the truth. Moreover, the regulations and credit are at stake, and they cannot be satisfied with empty words. As for the practical training fees for the medical and engineering departments, they are indispensable every day. In ordinary times, if there is a lack of practical materials, the German professors will refuse to teach. Their sense of responsibility is certainly understandable. In this time of economic hardship, it is even more impossible to deal with. Moreover, all the water and electricity for the school are supplied by the practical training factory. Now, the factory has no funds to purchase the materials needed. In the future, not only will the professors strike, but the factory may also stop working. I am incompetent and have no way to make up for the deficiencies. If this continues, I will not be able to sleep or eat in peace. From morning to night, those who come to the president's office are either demanding payment of old debts or chasing unpaid salaries. I have no time to think about academic matters. This violates my original intention and I am afraid of making mistakes. I do not want the school's long history to be interrupted in the middle. It is appropriate to present the difficult situation in detail. I humbly request that you approve my resignation from the position of president and appoint a capable person to replace me, so that he can save the school from danger and promote school affairs. I await your orders with utmost anxiety. In addition to submitting separately, I respectfully submit this to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education.</p>

<h3>Last Night's West Youth Basketball Game: John Wins Over McKinley</h3>
<p>John 34... McKinley 23</p>
<p>Xia Guang 23... Nan Feng 14</p>
<p>丨There are six Group A teams competing tonight丨</p>
<p>The West Youth Basketball Association held Group A and B matches last night, starting at 7:50 PM. The results were: (1) Group B, Xia Guang defeated Nan Feng 23 to 14; (2) Group A, John defeated McKinley 34 to 23. John's victory was actually quite precarious. Chen Xianglong was in danger of being ejected in the first half due to four fouls, but fortunately, he fought hard in the end. Hou Xuemin made many shots, securing the win. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Xia Guang Wins Over Nan Feng (Group B)</p>
<p>丨23 to 14丨</p>
<p>The first match, Xia Guang versus Nan Feng, was a decent performance. Both sides moved quite clearly, but their ball skills seemed less refined, and they lacked confidence in shooting, resulting in few points. Xia Guang took an early lead of 8 to 2. Nan Feng worked hard to catch up, ending the first half at 9 to 6, with Xia Guang leading by three points. Starting in the second half, Nan Feng's Guo Jiming and Xin Dingkui added three points, tying the game at 9 to 9. However, after that, Xia Guang's momentum suddenly surged. Chen Zhaoyu circled under the basket, lively and extraordinary, repeatedly making shots and earning much applause. Although Nan Feng tried to counterattack, their inaccurate shots made it difficult to score. Xia Guang, relying on Chen Zhaoyu's efforts, secured the final victory at 23 to 14. In the second half, Xia Guang scored a total of 14 points, all by Chen Zhaoyu alone, which was no easy feat. Referee: Tafors.</p>
<p>Xia Guang Fouls and Points, Nan Feng Fouls and Points: Right Forward Kang Yuefa 3 fouls, 1 point. Right Forward Ma Youcheng 1 foul, 2 points. Left Forward Zhao Jiabin 1 foul, 0 points.

<p>John vs. McKinley (Group A)</p>
<p>丨34 to 23丨</p>
<p>The second match was Group A, John versus McKinley. The battle was fierce, and the situation seemed quite even. At the start, McKinley's Si Huoyuan scored, opening the record. John missed both free throws. After a long stalemate, Diao Youdao tossed a ball backward into the basket, and Chen Xianglong jumped up and tapped it in. These two miraculous shots were highly praised by the spectators. John then took a lead of 4 to 2. However, John's defense was quite lax; two players often stayed on the same line, allowing opponents to break through. Fortunately, McKinley's shots were inaccurate, keeping John safe. John coordinated their offense, and Hou Xuemin, like a butterfly picking flowers, was lively and agile, continuing to score. Lin Zejun also added a point. McKinley quickly chased after them, making the score 10 to 9. Suddenly, Chen Xianglong made a one-handed shot. McKinley's Meng Si committed two unpenalized movements and was stolen two points. Su Tai made a free throw, making the score quite close (12 to 12). John attacked with all their might. Hou Xuemin made two corner shots, taking the lead again at 16 to 12. McKinley refused to show weakness, rallying their spirits and striving to retaliate. Disaster struck John when center Chen Xianglong was dismissed with four fouls, weakening their strength. Fortunately, they defended hard. John still won the first half with a score of 19 to 13.</p>
<p>Starting in the second half, neither side yielded, and the situation was quite tense. However, John never lagged behind, but McKinley followed closely, with only a slight difference. The closest the score came was 23 to 21, only two points apart, making it very precarious. John then paused the game to reorganize their forces, and their momentum suddenly surged. The spectators were also energized. Hou Xuemin moved under the basket, unpredictable, repeatedly scoring and receiving great applause from the audience. In the end, John won with a score of 34 to 23. Hou Xuemin alone scored 20 points, making a great contribution. Referee: Brand.</p>

<p>Essay</p>
<h3>Oil Brake</h3>
<p>--- Ding</p>
<p>I have repeatedly been asked by friends about the principle and operation of oil brakes. I am writing this article in response and to bring it to the attention of those in the automotive industry.</p>
<p>Oil brakes (Hydraulic Brake) are commonly known as oil brakes. Cars such as Auburn, Chrysler, Plymouth, DeSoto, Graham, Dodge, and Reo all use it. Almost 30% of American-made cars use oil brakes. It can be seen that this machine is very popular.</p>
<p>The advantages of oil brakes include (1) simplicity (2) sensitivity (3) consistent braking force (4) no vibration noise from metal rods (5) no need for lubricating oil (6) no need for correction, etc. Compared with ordinary rod-pulled brakes, it is much better. The disadvantages are two: (1) the front and rear wheels brake at the same time (2) the braking effect is lost when oil leaks.</p>
<p>The principle of oil brakes is completely based on the fluid transmission method in physics. Any liquid does not shrink in volume due to pressure. When a certain amount of pressure is applied to the liquid, the liquid can transmit the same amount of pressure to where it reaches. This is illustrated in detail in the diagrams. The symbols used in each diagram are the same.</p>
<p>The first diagram shows the simplest structure of an oil brake. W is the brake pedal, P is the master piston, C is the master oil tank, T is the oil pipe, A is the small oil tank, B is the small piston, D is the cone, F is the front wheel, R is the rear wheel, S is the brake shoe, and L is the brake band. When the foot presses down on the master piston, the oil in the master oil tank is forced out and injected into the small oil tank through the oil pipe, pushing the small piston and lowering the cone, opening the brake shoes and pressing tightly on the K brake drum. The wheel is then clamped and stopped from rotating. When the pressure on the brake pedal is removed, the J spring contracts and returns to its original state, allowing the wheel to be free.</p>
<h3>First Diagram</h3>
<p>The second diagram shows the layout of the oil brake on the car chassis. M is the oil storage tank, used to replenish oil when there is a shortage. C is connected to the master oil tank, which is detailed in the third diagram. The top of the oil storage tank has a H handle, which is used to pump pressure to replenish oil to the master oil tank C. However, like Dodge cars, the oil storage tank and master oil tank are now combined into one, and there is no need to manually pump pressure, and the oil can be replenished to the master oil tank automatically. Just keep half a tank of oil in the oil storage tank. W is the brake pedal. The thick black line is the copper oil pipe, fixed to the chassis. N is a soft rubber pipe, one end connected to the copper pipe and the other end connected to the small oil tank. Therefore, this section must move with the wheel, so rubber pipes must be used. K is the brake drum. When the brake pedal is pressed down with the foot, the oil in the master oil tank is squeezed out and injected into the oil pipe, reaching all four wheels to perform its braking work.</p>
<h3>Second Diagram</h3>
<h3>Third Diagram</h3>
<p>The fourth diagram shows the detailed structure of the braking part of the oil brake. This is a contracting brake. The L brake band is on the outer ring of the K brake drum, but there are also expanding ones, that is, the brake band is placed on the inner ring of the brake drum. Its function is the same and will not be repeated. As shown in the diagram, when oil is injected from the N pipe, it pushes the small piston in the A tank outwards, pushing the E lever on both sides, which simultaneously tightens the L brake band, clamping the rotation of the brake drum K. When the oil pressure disappears, the J spring opens, causing the brake band and small piston to return to their original state. The bo in the lower part of the diagram represents the contents of tank A. There are two small pistons inside as the oil inlet, which is connected to the N soft rubber pipe. is the normal state. The two small pistons are lying in the tank. b is the braking state. The oil has been injected. The two small pistons are pushed and rushed out to both ends.</p>
<h3>Fourth Diagram</h3>
<p>The oil for oil brakes is a mixture of equal parts of castor oil and denatured alcohol. There are ready-made mixes available on the market. Its properties must be such that it is not easy to freeze, not easy to evaporate, and non-corrosive.</p>
<p>The usual attention to oil brakes is to prevent leakage. The places where oil leaks are mostly at the connection between the copper pipe and the rubber pipe. If you usually feel that the oil consumption is too high, there must be a leak. You can have one person step heavily on the brake pedal and another person check where the oil pipe goes to find the leak and repair it.</p>
<p>The small oil tank of the oil brake is not easy to damage. Its structure is very delicate. It must be disassembled with special tools. It is not necessary to disassemble it during repairs. If it is determined to be damaged, there are also complete existing goods that can be matched. Otherwise, it is a waste of effort.</p>
<p>After the oil brake has been repaired or the rubber pipe has been replaced, there is a very important job that cannot be ignored, that is, air must not be allowed to remain in the oil pipe. The volume of air can expand and contract. Leaving it in the oil pipe will cause uneven oil pressure, which is a major drawback. There is a vent on the small oil tank. Usually it is blocked with a screw. Open this hole first when venting. Step on the brake pedal a few times to see if the oil ejected from the hole no longer has air bubbles. This means that the air has been completely discharged. This job.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Vent one brake each time, and then take turns to the others. Do not vent all four brakes at the same time. Also, after the brake drum has been removed, do not step on the brake pedal, otherwise the small piston in the small oil tank may be pushed out, damaging important parts.</p>

The cost of building bridges and culverts, as well as paving the road surface, is estimated to be 172,285 yuan. In addition, 60,000 yuan is required to purchase light railways, totaling over 230,000 yuan. The entire road is currently divided into approximately four sections. The first section is from Paiwan to Fengfeng Nunnery, 7.13 kilometers. The second section is from Fengfeng Nunnery to Shitan Kiln, 10.70 kilometers. The third section is from Shitan Kiln to Luoyang Temple, 10.78 kilometers. The fourth section is from Luoyang Bridge to the East Gate of Jurong, 12.08 kilometers. Currently, the paving of the road surface from Paiwan in Zhenjiang to Fengfeng Nunnery was contracted to the Miao Shunxing Construction Company in August of this year. The construction cost is a total of 27,319 yuan, and the deadline for completion is December 30 of this year. The repair of the roadbed and soilwork, as well as the construction of culverts, is also contracted to the same company, at an estimated cost of 2,597.10 yuan, it is said.</p>
