<p>時評</p>
<h3>保安公約與國聯公約</h3>
<p>此次倫敦會議閉幕時。英相麥克唐納説明大會經過。謂歐洲部分。尙須賴一種保安條約以資保護。如今日簽訂條約中所載者是。蓋即指前數日所商訂之地中海保安公約而言也。而此種保安公約之所由起。則以歐局糾紛。無妥善解决辦法。所賴以維持歐局之國際聯盟公約。又不满人意。故在此次會議中。先有要求解釋國聯公約第十六條之爭議。而此地中海之保安公約。即不啻以國聯公約之保護力爲未足。而又再加一層保護也。惟此次倫敦會議中所商訂之保安公約。是否已有圓满結果。今尙未知而前日内瓦所訂之國聯公約。自去年動議修改解釋後。今據電訊。修改公約委員會。已將開議謂此次起草。以容納一切防止戰爭公約爲主。英美德法將有重要提案。是國聯公約之修改。能否有圓满解决。亦尙須待之異日。然則倫敦條約所倚賴之两重保護力。是否確實鞏固。足爲會員國安全之保障。固亦尙在遙遠而縹渺中也。</p>
<p>夫求和平而責望於减軍。求减軍而責望於條約一减軍條約。之不足。而又責望於種種保安公約。凱洛克之和平公約。簽訂未久也。以和平公約之不足以資保障。乃又謀保障於倫敦海軍條約與種種公約。條約之約朿愈多。則誠意愈微。效力亦將愈弱矣。雖然。一條約之成。不知費却無數之心力時間與口舌爭執。即如此次海軍條約之成。經過三閲月之倫敦會議。而事前之奔走籌備不計焉。倫敦會議之前。先經過華盛頓日内瓦等種種會議。不知又費去若干之心力時間與口舌爭執。更加以其他種種公約之所費。不可謂非努力和平之大犧牲。然而結果所獲。僅僅如此。則祗可諉爲世運使然。我又安敢苛責人事之不盡哉。</p>

<h3>言論</h3>
<p>全國敎育會議討論時之感想汪懋祖</p>
<p>第二次全國敎育會議、已於二十三日閉幕專家家員汪懋祖君於閉幕後著一文述討論時之感想、茲特披露於左編者附誌、甲、義務敎育</p>
<p>義務敎育學齡、不應在附註内説明、應另標一節、明定國家學齡、國家學齡期間、不特稍寛、可自六歲至十五歲、各地方再就國家所定期限内、斟酌情形、定出地方學齡、在同一地方兒童及年届地方學齡就學不容參差、方案内應規定每學年至少授課若干或若干週、各地方如有特别情形、每年授課期間不能如規定日數時、須延長年限</p>
<p>乙、師資訓練</p>
<p>（一）鄉村師範學校招收初中畢業生、修業期間修正爲三年、高小畢業生延爲六年、恐難實行一初中多設城市學生畢業、即志願人師範、多不肯赴鄉村、况其年限又加長二、某省開辦鄉師、招收初中畢業生、訓練二年、而初中生應者寥寥不得已多收具同等學力資格者、三、蘇省鄉師收高小畢業年在十五以上者、訓練二年、（此後加增一年）畢業後服務大感供不應求、現在推廣義敎、而一方面延長師資訓練年限敎師更感缺乏、小學　爲六年、同此困難</p>
<p>（二）在理論上說鄕村與城市師資、自不應有所高下、但當義務推廣之際、　與量不能兼顧時、只好先顧數量、鄙意宜縮短年限、趕造多數師資漸求質的攺善、否則義務敎育恐不能如期完成、（三）師範生供膳問題、此次討論不多、至爲可惜、照歴史及實際看去此制不能完全取銷鄙意最好案照學業操行體育之總成績、採用分等獎厲辦法、給予津貼、津貼費總額不少、於應發之膳費總額</p>
<p>（四）師範獨立問題、數年前中師合併議起、余主張師範應絶對獨立、會蕙集關於師範獨立之論文數篇並自著之（師範敎育五大問題）一篇、合刋一册散發、又在敎育攺進社年會時提出（師範獨立）之議案、在蘇省中師合併時余仍起而方争乃在此次會議中反發（中）（師）可以互相兼設之議、誠有見於經濟落後、敎育未發達地方欲添設一校、異常困難故主張有中學可兼設師範科、有師範學校亦可兼設普通科、至中師未合併者固不必合己合者亦不必說明逐漸令其獨立蓋恐某種團體借此而羣起請願做復校運動、必爲學風之累、此外余叉以爲現在師範大學太少、應由政府劃定區域逐漸開設各省亦應設立大規模之中心師範、至少一所多至四所、</p>
<p>（五）師範生畢業後、苟有他種機會、多不願服務小學、尤其是能力强的、此點極爲可悲可危、方案中規定要追繳學費實非追費所能限制、根本辦法、只有提高俸給實行年功加俸、鄕付與城市、一律待遇、</p>
<p>丙中等敎育</p>
<p>（一）提高普高程度集中辦理、余極贊成惟欲將高級中學仿法國之Ｌycie及日本之高等辦法、其先决問題須加增初中年限余己有（中學採用四三制）之論文發表矣、</p>
<p>（二）高中各科分設與合設問題、余對於原方案農第二次全國敎育會議之回顧（四）</p>

<p>（八）中小學敎職員進修辦法</p>
<p>（一）開辦暑期學校、（甲）每年由各國國立大學開辦、若國立大學有二所以上在同一地點、或國立大學在省市敎育行政機關所在地者、得會商合辦、（乙）各省各特别市每年應辦一所、應不收學費、課和適合需要、省辦的每年地點不必同、不辦暑期講習會市縣應各派二人人學、</p>

<p>三縣立初中設置標準、原方案内規定全縣敎費在三萬元以上者、即得設置（修正爲四萬）余對此仍不免懷疑、緣現在因辦初中而移用義務敎經費者甚多、一縣有三萬元經費、設立一初中已費去八千、小學將如何敎縣聯合辦理之法、最爲相宜</p>
<p>丁高等敎育</p>
<p>（一）初中高中設置標準内、均規定省或縣市敎育經費須在若干萬以上、方得設置、小學或初中畢業生人數、亦有規定、高等敎育方案内、無此規定而現在已設大學之省分、聞且有未設高者、招生困難同時該省初中畢業生求學亦困難、往往遠至亦滬多數入上海未立案之私立大學或其中學部、聞某大學停辦後某省學生、有仳難失所之苦、殊屬可憐、</p>
<p>（二）政府如欲開闢邊省、提高文化推進事業、則以國欵設大學於邊省、而移學生於其他、此種政　極應倡導、但以省欵設大學、似須如初高中之有規定省縣經費標準庶幾用意一貫耳、他若中等學校職業敎育問題甚多、當爲文另詳之、（四月二十四日草於首都中央飯店）</p>

<h3>撮影珍談鄭逸梅</h3>
<p>但君杜宇。海上之美術家也。善寫仕女。嫵媚之氣盎然縑幅間。顧近瘁於電影事業。實無點染之暇晷。故雖知好。亦罕能得其畫裏眞眞也。君又擅撮景。羅名姝若干爲其景中人。或顰或笑。宜喜宜嗔。背景又融以畫理。因是所作。無不意致超逸。神態欲活。而尤以雅秋小妹妹之影爲多。小妹妹天生尤物。其美且合於時代性。彼羅西亞人。偶覩其玉潔之趺。爲之顚倒欲絶。况君以藝術手腕爲之留眞。則一肌一容。更臻妙境固母待言。予嘗見君攝動靜之物焉。桌上舗以細沙。一拳石。一折枝。竟以位置之。出禽鳥之標本。而加以造作。有張翅欲飛者。有棲止啄粒者。及影成見示。則輕重濃淡。氣韻神味。儼然一幅國粹花卉畫也。爲之咋舌不置。君嗜撮景故。乃廣購西方之雜志及撮景專書。有愜意之圖照。輒截取之。而黏存於皮面硬夾之册籍中人。體風景。動物靜物。分類别門。以便隨時之展賞。雜志及專書。旣經截取。則以糟粕視之。抛置而不之貴矣。據云。不如是。其猶芳蘭雜伍於蕭艾中。不易領其國香。君曩於魯意師摩拍賣行中。見有西人某君所黏存之圖照薈本十巨册。名貴作品。琳瑯满目。卒以數百金被某西藝術家購去。君羞澀於囊。未能攫爲已有。至今述之。尙爲之憾惜云。</p>
<h3>一封奇特之家書氷心</h3>
<p>氷心喜與文士交。近有十餘年不見之同文友章用九者。自淮陰移居滬上。旣餽我以土儀。又設杯茗。邀我過其新居。坐。</p>
<p>甫定。不速之客一人來。西裝革履。丰度翩翩。用九日。丈來大佳。正苦寂飲寡歡也。余亦因用九紹介互通姓名。須臾用九夫人陳芸蓀女士出。呼以表叔。且問表嬸日來有家信否。客笑而不言。及入座。共五人。用九尙有一女年甫十三。亦簉座於末位。客操皖音。人極伉爽。酒半。問用九曾遣令　入校否。用九以吾國敎育。尙未盡美爲言。客日。然則竟廢學乎。女子不學。小而影響於一家。大而影響於一國。言次連引满。若不勝其感慨者。嗣聞用九自課以中西文字。始色然而喜。迨酒闌。客先去氷心日。客雖青年。亦有心人哉。芸蓀微笑。用九方欲有言。而十三歲之女公子儳言日。倘再見。母铁復問其家書。芸蓀笑益縱。氷心好奇。固請其説。而一封奇特之家書。乃由用九盡情披露。宜客之注重女學也。芸蓀之祖母。客之姨母也。而客所娶婦。又爲芸蓀同族。但世系遠。不能考其行輩。婦幼小時。與芸蓀居同里閈。朝夕過從甚相契。及女子有行。各異其地。不相見者十四三年。幸用九與客同就食淮陰。芸蓀屢致書於婦。附於客竹報中。迄未一答。一日與用九同坐客家。綠衣使至。婦有書來。客急納於懷而不啓視。用九調之日。婚已數年。豈猶有旖旎語耶。客日否。芸蓀謂嬸固我同族。念之綦切。請自發書。而以平安告我。我等亦不敢攫而視其秘密也。客慨然日。吾婦所乏惟才。所謂家書。實秦皇没字碑耳。彼此至戚。固亦無所隠。乃探懷出書。拆而示用九夫婦。上有硃點二。告翁姑之康健也。中有墨圈二。需銀圓二十枚。也下有大墨塗一團。小墨塗一團。則己身無恙。與嬰兒茁壯之表示也最後書明禎两字則其名也。生平除此两字。蓋無一字。以有着筆者。客袁氏。名松琴。年二十有六。婦陳明。禎。少松琴二歲。丰度翩　。而中無所有云。氷心敢述之。以告女同胞。</p>
<h3>記新藝劇社之楊小姐秘密巨</h3>
<p>新藝劇社爲新華藝術大學校友陶忠澄曹祖繩王藝之君等所組織。日前應該校之邀。加入三週紀念游藝大會表演話劇（楊小姐的秘密）。是劇由愛美劇家谷劍塵先生導演及編劇。寓意深刻劇情緊凑。爲近來罕有之作。楊小姐由呂瓊霞女士飾。身段婀娜語調悲慘。要求公安局長勿嚴辦俱樂部。及拒絶紳士周吉厂之求婚一節。頗能表出楊小姐之身份。及組織大華俱樂部之宗旨。聞女士初次登臺。而有如此成績。將來未可量也。少女陶靜芳一角由孫士溥女士飾。女士曾在今夏戲劇協社公演（血花）中飾主角。表情語調。早有極佳成績。一舉一動。一言一語。將貴族千金傲岸倔强之神氣。盡量表現。極得觀衆之贊美。曹祖繩君之楊鄭烈。一種勇敢之氣。亢爽之神。用大方之舉動表出極佳。王藝之君飾傅君陶。精神活潑。熊度莊嚴。他如文容泉君之周吉厂。李登雲女士之潘彩紅。張秀英女士之菊花姐。甘素珊女士之美雲。均能恪守劇中人身分。聞該社成立至今。未及半載。而能表演三句鐘之長劇。可謂難能可貴矣。</p>
<h3>談起死回生術黄影呆</h3>
<p>近世科學日昌。文化日進。舉凡天然之物。爲昔人所不能製造者。今則皆能以人力爲之。我知古人而在今世。見天空翔翔之飛機。海底游行之潛艇。必萬分驚異。而幾疑在夢幻中也。人死之後不能復活雖三尺童子。亦莫不知之。而最近德國生理學家米西羅斯基PioflesjorLMMichaolowski敎授竟以發明起死回生術聞矣米。氏爲德國人。在俄國中亚細亚大學任生理學系主任敎授之職。深信人死之後。可用科學方法。使其復活。曾將各種動物加以實騐結。果頗爲满意。米氏之研究起死回生術也。已十餘年於茲矣。平日獨居於實騐室中。悉心研究。冀此術之及早成功。最近曾以猴子一頭。將其全身血液。由血管中完全取</p>

<p>初三乃陰歷二月之四日爲馬來土人之新年節。畫則其人全家坐風車（汽車此地呼風車）游行。晚則於柳林架薄板爲跳舞場男女跳舞唱歌。余往觀之。有西人。有華人。有馬來人。有吉寗人。（印度人之一種色極黑）黄白黑機。老少男女。不愧爲天然人種博物陳列所之是也。棚外電燈煇煌。棚内馬來人音樂會。有小鼓。三絃。琵琶。雅琳。提琴之類。音調甚可聽。覺比吾華聚會。用銅鑼之太閙者爲清雅矣。友人新劇大家歐陽予倩氏。哲理高深。最惡劇中之鑼鼓。謂爲戲劇革命中第一不能存在之物。予亦深惡其聒耳。蓋其存在者。一爲勾引兒童耳目之用。因到處下等賞識者多。而高雅人少。只好以此亂其耳而已。然吾以爲大鑼鼓之劣。尙不如馬來音樂之靜雅也。想歐陽君以爲然否。至其跳舞式。與西人跳舞之男女交抱而跳者尙不同。以男女各两三對爲一排。相對面而跳。身手不相接觸。亦有種種姿勢女者先唱而跳男人着半式或全式之西裝。亦有皮鞋。女則大抵赤足。於地板上跳而身上則着五采單衣。女之最小者。才十四五歲。惟余每於觀察男女社會中任何時。男皆取攻勢。而女則主守。男一遇異性。總呈狂態。而女則邐落不甚現笑容也。華人亦有入塲參觀者。四週圍繞。黑白黄臉相擠。夜景亦奇麗矣。至十時餘。跳未休。余乃歸寢。</p>
<p>此地之歷法有四種。一陽歷。二陰歷。三馬來歷。四回回歷。其過年之節各不同。各有其新年。一人在此過一歳可當四歲矣。語言文字。則尤複雜。各處電車及告示告白。大致用四種文。一英文。二漢文。三回文。四馬來文所謂四文。乃印度文之一種。因印人信回敎者多也。而同爲漢語。每省之人言語不通。故國語運動。在南洋爲第一要務也。</p>
<p>抑按生存竸爭之理言之。馬來人之新年。吾不知其作何感想。此本爲彼之土地。彼眞此土之主人翁也。今第一政治主人爲英政府。第二經濟主人爲華人。日本人。彼等眞奴隸生活耳。雖然。觀於各地慘案。吾人安有許多眼淚暇及爲馬來人哀哉。要之世界一日未大同。則民族平等。只可於血堆中求之耳。美之茵蔯人。乃美洲舊主人也。台灣生番。台灣舊主人也。中國小洞苗民中。國舊主人也。鳴呼。安得請我佛一説明其因果之故乎。</p>
<h3>歐游通訊（五十二）劉海粟</h3>
<p>巴黎的電影院</p>
<p>電影本來不是我很愛看的東西。但我們到了巴黎以後却有點喜歡他。我同幾個朋友於每一星期之中至少要去看一次。玩味那銀幕的轉變。聽那音樂特異的節奏和可驚的和聲。尤其在休息的時候吃杯咖啡。看艶鬼們的輕盈的動作。極妖媚之致。得二小時之閑。可以安慰六日的勞作。看完之後終是睡得很痛快。次早起來再去繼續各人的學業。無論到圖書館到美術院或者作畫或者讀書都覺得很舒適。我們於用功讀書以外。必須還有一點隨便的優游與娛樂。生活才覺得有意思。焚香靜坐的閒淡而稚逸的生活。固然是我所很愛好的。其實我在國内有一個時期確已做過一段這様的生活。而且同時大畫其蘭竹默誦道德經。但是到媚艶沉醉的塲中去看看。也别饒馥郁豐腴的趣味。這都是生活上必要的。一般人每每以娛樂爲不正經。眞是奇怪極了。所以中國社會生活。却是極端地乾燥粗鄙。</p>
<p>巴黎的電影院共有一百四十幾家。其中有規模最大的Gaumont-Palaceo有建築最新Ｐaramanto有門票最貴的Madeleine和MarivauxPaiheo還有無數的門口叮······響着電鈴的區電影院。所謂區電影院者。是那些散布於各區的小電影院。專備工人及小商人們娛樂的。那些電影院的座位也很便宜。不過影片終是大影戲院映過的老片。子我們有時也光臨。從售票處拖着一條二三丈的長尾巴。循序漸進去買票。有時候這條尾巴可以一直排立到馬路上。儘管人多。時間長大家終是伸着頸子靜候着依次前進。我們有時候也去排立其中伸着頸子等候。覺得别有風味。一位傅君性急往往半途竄去了。我常存着這樣的一個概念。這樣等候着看影戲。假使在中國也許要打得頭破血淋、在這裏。也可以説着出一點社會的秩序至於那Madeleine和Marivaux等恰好相反眞是貴族極了。豪奢極了他們所演的片子總是巴黎第一次出映的嶄新的美國片子。一張片子至少要連映一個月在大門口有許多穿禮服的侍者來開汽車門來引導。裏面的裝璜眞是莊麗而宏偉。而且實在奇拔得可觀。坐位也極其舒服。每在休息的時候。都可以去吸烟飲酒。門票賣得很貴。至少也要二十佛郎以上。我們都是窮人。大抵無力常常趕去看。只有豪奢的闊人。這纔常常跑到Madeleine和Marivaux去凑熱閙。</p>

<h3>日輪神吉丸失事眞相</h3>
<p>廣利輪援救船員</p>
<p>日輪神吉丸、在汕頭外失事、滬上盛傅其全部船員、被海盜架去、昨日救護該日輪之廣利號船、巳於下午二時到滬、茲將其船員所述神吉丸之失事、與廣利輪之助救情形、分紀如下、</p>
<p>日船觸礁情形　日輪神吉丸、係從台灣運煤一千餘噸運往廣東、行至汕頭東海面、地名喇嘛島燈塔外、因海面大霧、走錯路綫、致觸入燈塔外之小舟島暗礁上、船艙被礁石套進、船中進水、霎時間即下沉、船上並無無綫電報、故船員等、祇得各謀逃生</p>
<p>船員逃上燈塔　神吉丸輪中、共有船員水手二十六名、其中日本人、如船長·大副機關長等計七名、又有中國海員十九名、均係山東籍、出事後、見船身沉入海中、其時又無船舶經過、由各船員水手、爭放救生艇、共用两隻舳板船、每次乘四五人、從霧浪中開向喇嘛島燈塔上暫避、擬俟有輪船經過時、再行求救、迨至最後一批船員下舳板、始經廣利發見、　　廣利救送至厦　在日輪失事後三小時招商局廣利輪、適由粤赴温經過喇嘛島時、船主愛文生、用望遠鏡、瞭望航路、其時霧己漸退、見燈塔上掛求救旗號、又見小舟島有船失事、在波濤渺溟中、似見一小舢板、載多人破浪而來、廣利船主、即命抛錨停輪、用旗語通知舢板中人、告以特來救援、神吉丸船主、適在小船内、即將各船員、攺关上廣利輪、復再往燈塔、將先救起各人、亦一律駁入廣利、迨二十六名船員、救上廣利後、由廣利供給食物、然後依照日人請求、將此一批人、送到厦門上陸、</p>
<p>漁船誤認爲盜　船員求去後、其失事船、便全部抛棄、因船底爲礁石擱住、尚有半身露出海面而在小舟島附近一帶打漁船甚多、因日輪船中無人、各漁舟爭往該輪携取物件、而燈塔方面、乃誤認爲盜、其時因廣利輪救得各船員後、曾代發一無線電、在汕頭外海、日本軍艦、首先接到、便即馳往神吉丸失事處、幾誤認中國漁舟爲海盜之船、幸各漁舟即開去、得未發生慘劇、</p>
<p>沉船損失約計　刻下該日輪、尚留一艙面在海、全船之煤均沉在輪内、船身與貨物之損失、約在十萬元以上、船員行李等物、有一部分均皆取出、據聞日人尚擬將沉煤打撈云、</p>

<h3>少女猝斃牽涉</h3>
<p>新婚夫婦與一喜娘里巷謡傅新娘是一石女喜娘不承認事實上代表一番吵鬧少女猝斃今日法院剖騐屍體浦東塘橋鎭北首三北婦人韓馮氏之女夏良年方二八、突然於昨晨九時猝斃、案情牽涉一對新婚夫婦及喜娘三人、甚爲離奇、茲探誌詳情如左、</p>
<p>喜期親朋雲集　　先是有寗波人胡本初、年二十四歳、向在輪船上服務、住居於浦東塘橋鎭西市於本月二十二號、娶妻完婚新娘係袁姓、亦甬人、年二十七歲、較新郎大三歲、貌平平、且素患目疾、光線己打折扣、故視物略感糢糊、幼時曾許人爲妻、但不久未婚夫因病逝世、嗣後年歲長大、無人作伐顧問以致延擱在家、最近始經人介紹與胡姓訂婚擇吉於該日迎娶、屆日親朋雲集、甚爲熱鬧、</p>
<p>事實上之代表　是日上午十一時、新娘彩輿臨門、伴隨新娘來到乾宅者爲一年輕喜娘、名閔彩園、亦甬人、年方二十二歲、身材魁悟貌較新娘爲美、至其隨同新娘過門之意、謂係因新娘目有暗疾故隨便在乾宅爲新娘照料數日、詎因此外間怱有一種謠傳、謂新娘係屬石女（俗呼雌孵雄）故年華老太、方始字人出閣、過門後、則以喜娘爲事實上之代表、而新娘袁氏、祇有名而無實云云、一時十傳百知、街談巷議、衆說紛紜、尤以附近華昌火柴梗片廠中、傳說愈甚、幾於無一不知、事爲該喜娘所知、頓時怒不可遏、一番莫大之糾紛隨之而起、</p>
<p>喜娘洶洶問罪　喜娘閔彩園、旣聞此惡劣傳說、以與本身名譽、大有關係、若不嚴究是項謠傳之來源、難以水落石出、故親自往華昌廠中查詢、旋探得該項傳說、謂係該廠女工三北人韓馮氏所散佈云云、該喜娘益爲憤怒、當查悉馮氏家居該鎭北首三埭頭内、故於前晚八時、突興問罪之師、馳往馮氏家吵鬧、一時娘子軍大起衝突、喜娘身高力大、馮氏頗非所敵、後經人解勸始散</p>
<p>少女突然身死　馮氏有閨女一、名夏良、年方十六歳貌尚不惡、小足伶仃、向隨母於華昌廠内工作、經該不相識之喜娘閔彩園一番吵鬧之後、突然於昨晨九時、在家猝斃、馮氏見愛女身死若是之速、即赴該處三區三分所、指控閔彩園將伊女毆死、要求伸雪、當由該所長飭派地保朱惠生投報地方法請騐、一面將該喜娘閔彩園、及一對新婚夫婦胡本初與妻袁氏、一併拘所、押候解院訊究、</p>
<p>相騐並無傷痕　午後三時由地方法院委派雷檢察官沈檢騐員蒞浦到塲檢騐、先據尸母韓馮氏偕子祥正投案聲稱年四十三歳、寗波人、死者係我親生之女、因被閔彩園毆傷身死、請求嚴辦云云、當經檢騐員將尸身解衣週身察騐、騐得傷痕尚無發現、惟面部右頰有一形似手印之靑塊、斷定並非致命傷、當以一時未能檢騐明白、即向屍母詢曰、騐得死者尚無傷痕發見、仰侯將尸抬院、於明日（即今日）上午十時繼續剖騐、詎馮氏聞諭、抱住尸身、、大跳大哭、聲稱要求老爺伸冤云云、久器不止</p>
<p>里巷傳說紛紜　自此案發生後、事未經日、竟哄動浦東遠近、故午後騐尸時、觀者紛至沓來擠得水洩不通、一般觀衆之目的、咸欲明瞭死者是否係被閔彩園毆傷畢命、或嚇碎心膽而死、抑係另有别因、但結果仍未騐明眞相、以故犬失所望、但事後又有人傳說、謂被拘之喜娘閔彩園、早己羅敷有夫、王姓惟係戇大、現在虹鎭做小生意度日、而新娘胡袁氏、是否石女、亦難憑信云云、</p>
<h3>一頁騙婚遺棄史</h3>
<p>龔惠芬所適非人</p>
<p>馮斐鴻始亂終棄</p>
<p>法官說被告較長</p>
<p>不免有欺騙情形</p>
<p>誘惑成姦　婦人馮龔氏（即龔惠芬）、近延朱希雲律師、在地方法院狀訴伊夫馮斐鴻遺棄不顧、爲此請求脫離關係、並求　當還債等情、其詞略謂、原告今上廿七歳、係瀏河人、自幼與宋姓訂婚、昔年於十七歳時、由鄕來滬、住居嬸母家内、、即被該被告馮斐鴻誘惑成姦</p>
<p>髮妻尚在　查馮係在小世界對門開設馮文記玻璃店、原告自被誘惑之後、即唆使原告回至母家、取得衣飾等約值五六千元、來滬同居、一面與宋姓解除婚約、先時被告推托原配新故、願娶原告爲室、所以原告將一切衣飾、一任被告吸烟化用、原告一再催其結婚、初稱宋姓婚約未解、不便舉行、繼稱伊受反對、近原告探悉被告之妻尚在、但原告己生一女、故祇得隠忍、</p>
<p>遺棄不顧　不料被告見原告私蓄用罄、即不常來、但日常生活在在需錢、無如被告亦不肯給付生活費、原告不得己、逐漸典質（計當去三百七十五元二角）敷衍、不足時又向友人處借得洋四百元、本年因拖欠租金數月、房主及債權一再催索、原告即委律師致函被告、詎竟置之不睬、</p>
<p>搶去女兒　女乘原告不在家時、將小女私自搶去、原告向之索還小女、反遭被告唤人、將原告毆打、曾由公安局將被告馮斐鴻拘送鈞院、因其吸食洋烟、奉判監禁一月、並罰洋七十元在案、</p>
<p>情義毫無　查該被告初則誘騙成姦、唆使私取衣飾、供其揮霍、繼則遺棄不顧、終則搶女糾衆毆打、可知被告情義毫無、勢難偕老、爲此請求脫難關係、並請追當本洋三百五十七元二角及其利息又借欵洋四百元、又利息至清償日止、女孩歸原告領回、並給付生活費、</p>
<p>當票一束　昨日由趙振海推事開</p>
<p>庭審訊被告馮斐鴻不到、由代理律師到庭、爲之陳述、先據原告馮龔氏供、年二十七歳、瀏河人、現住西門外方板橋銀河里二十五號、並供述前情、呈出當票一束、約數十紙、</p>
<p>口是心非　又稱被告烟癮極大、一天非五六元不能過癮、因此我之五六千金衣飾被其用罄、去年冬間被告之父病故之後我以爲從此可以與被告結婚了、又可以過快樂的日子、不料被告完全口是以非、直至現在我始知受愚、要求准予脫離、並求判决令被告　當還債等種種、</p>
<p>近方出獄　訊至此、由被告所延之李祖虞律師起而陳述被告年歳籍貫住址職業、略稱被告馮斐鴻、年四十二歳、武進人、在小世界對門開設馮文記玻璃店生理、被告此次因吸食洋烟奉鈞院判决監禁、及罰金、甫於日前期滿、由漕河涇第二監獄釋出、因此患病、今日不能到庭、</p>
<p>提出反訴　現被告提出反訴、向原告追還洋一千一百元、緣前民國十三年八月間、娶被告爲妾、此次原告乘被告在獄之際、私搬紅木器具、約值四百元、又私將房屋頂與他人、原告得有頂費洋七百元、因此反訴爲一千一百元、至於原告請求脫離、被告並不反對云云、</p>
<p>不免欺騙　又據證人周言（女性）到庭提出借據一紙、證明借欵洋四百元、交由被告之手等語、問官得供、以原告與被告當時結合時、被告年歳較大、免有欺騙情形、、並諭兩造律師在外和解、如和解不成、再行訊核遂退庭</p>

<h3>明日的成人霖</h3>
<p>第一次全國童子軍總檢閲、最近在首都舉行、不但開中國童子軍的新紀元、也是近幾年來、吾國青年運動中所堪注意的一件事、這次總檢閲出席的團體、雖祇有一百二十一團、童子軍人數不满四千、冠以全國两字、果然是渺小得很、不過在十幾年來、明瞭中國童子軍過去狀况的人看起來、知道這一棵小小的種子、已經由萌芽而入於滋長、從播種而進於繁殖倘然好好的培植維護、再隔上十年工夫、這一棵小小的種子、在青年的園地裏、還不是結着一個肥碩的果子麽、這一個很好的結果、便是（明日的成人）、</p>
<p>的確、童子軍是一種遊戲一、種眞正的遊戲、利用康健的環境、來發展孩童的天性、我們知道人類具有創造的能力、和欣賞自然的本性、孩子們尤其容易發展這两種特點、始創童子軍訓練的具登堡爵士、認明了這一個關鍵、在一九零八年創著（童子偵察）一書書成一半的時候、英國已經有了童子軍組織、這本書裏所講的多是具氏從事實上得來的經騐、他在一八九九至一九零一年中、從軍駐戍南非洲、眼見白人遠不及土著耐勞機警、於是創小隊的偵察訓練、以每六人爲一隊、常令與隊員深切接近、注重野外工作、發揮自動能力久之成効很著、這種訓練的辦法、是依照他在馬發根訓練童子偵探隊而起的、童子偵探隊的工作、佐理行軍上的斥堠、其心靈思想的敏捷、及責任心的重大、遠過意料之外、故而他見成人軍士不濟事的時候、就想着這一種的訓練來補救、那末拿種訓練直接施之於兒童、豈不是更爲有意義麽、</p>

<p>Yang Hucheng Reports by Telegram</p>
<h3>Military Situation in Southern Henan</h3>
<p>Defensive positions around Neixiang are very strong.</p>
<p>Northwest Army abandons original plan.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Hucheng reported to Nanjing by telegram on the operational strategies of the Northwest Army's recent eastward advance into southern Henan and western Hubei, and the 7th Army's response: (1) The Northwest rebel troops, led by Liu Ruming, Tian Jinkai, Zhang Weixi, and others, with a force of 40,000 (claiming 60,000), are heading east towards Xiang and Wan, intending to first launch a feint attack on Xiangfan with a portion of their force, while the main force would fiercely attack Neixiang. Because Neixiang is located on the flank of Xiangfan, its military position is extremely important. If Neixiang is not captured, the enemy will not dare to face Xiangfan directly and advance further east. Therefore, they must first capture Neixiang, then advance eastward into Nanyang, threatening Xiangfan, and advance directly to Wuhan, supporting the southward advance of the rebels along the Pinghan Railway, converging in Zheng and Bian, and watching for an opportunity to seize Xuzhou. (2) Liu Ruming, Tian Jinkai, Zhang Weixi, and others originally planned to capture Neixiang first with their main force, thereby realizing their eastward advance. As a result, they clashed with the Central Army's 7th Army stationed in Neixiang and the Wenquji area of western Hubei. Neixiang has been surrounded by the rebel troops of Zhang, Liu, and Tian since March 26. However, the 7th Army had built extremely solid fortifications in the Neixiang area and stored three months' worth of provisions, determined to defend the area. In addition, all officers and soldiers bravely defended the area with concerted efforts. Therefore, after three weeks, the rebels attacked more than ten times with several times the troop strength but ultimately failed to succeed. The rebels were unable to attack Neixiang and did not dare to threaten Xiangfan. The enemy's morale declined, and they everywhere requisitioned provisions, forcibly recruited laborers, and recruited bandits. Military discipline deteriorated, and they were extremely distressed. Currently, most of Zhang's rebel troops have reached the Baofeng and Yexian areas, and the remaining troops are following closely behind. However, Nanzhao and Fangcheng are also stationed with powerful units of the Central Army's 7th Army, with solid trenches and fortifications. (3) The 7th Army's operational strategy against the Northwest rebels is to order the troops stationed in Neixiang, Dengxian, and Zhenping counties to defend their positions based on the trenches, luring the enemy deep in for a combined attack. At the same time, two mixed brigades were drawn out, which would immediately launch attacks to reverse the advance as soon as the enemy entered. At the same time, the defending troops were ordered to launch a combined attack as the opportunity arose, aiming to annihilate them in one fell swoop. On the left flank, close communication and defense were established with the Central Army's 10th Army. Therefore, the Northwest Army abandoned its original plan to attack Xiangfan and seize Wuhan in its overall strategy and changed to focus on the Longhai Railway area. This was primarily due to the strong defense of Wan. (4) Investigation of the rebel army's eastward offensive force: The Fifth Route Commander of the rebel army, Liu Ruming's unit, has approximately 6,000 men, approximately 4,000 rifles, four field guns, more than ten mountain guns, and more than twenty mortars; The Seventh Division of the rebel army, Tian Jinkai's unit, has approximately 9,000 men, approximately 7,000 rifles, more than twenty mountain guns, and more than forty mortars; The Third Route Commander of the rebel army, Zhang Weixi's unit, has approximately 16,000 men, approximately 12,000 rifles, more than ten mountain guns, and more than sixty mortars. In addition, Liu Ruming has also organized three divisions of western Hubei bandits, with Hu Renyan as one division, Zhang Hengjin as one division, and Xue Chengde as one division, totaling approximately 10,000 men and approximately 7,000 to 8,000 rifles. In total, the rebel army's eastward offensive force is over 40,000. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Security Convention and League of Nations Covenant</h3>
<p>At the closing of the London Conference, British Prime Minister MacDonald explained the proceedings, stating that Europe still needs a security treaty for protection, such as the one contained in the treaty signed today. This refers to the Mediterranean Security Convention that was negotiated a few days ago. The reason for this type of security treaty is that there is no proper solution to the disputes in Europe, and the League of Nations Covenant, which is relied upon to maintain the European situation, is unsatisfactory. Therefore, in this conference, there was first a dispute over the interpretation of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, and this Mediterranean Security Convention is no less than adding another layer of protection because the protective power of the League of Nations Covenant is insufficient. However, it is still unknown whether the Security Convention negotiated at the London Conference has achieved a satisfactory result. The League of Nations Covenant, which was concluded in Geneva the day before, has been under discussion for modification and interpretation since it was proposed last year. According to telegrams, the committee for amending the covenant has already started discussing, saying that the current drafting will focus on accommodating all conventions for preventing war. The United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and France will have important proposals. Whether the modification of the League of Nations Covenant can be satisfactorily resolved is still to be seen in the future. Therefore, whether the double protective power on which the London Treaty relies is truly solid and can provide a guarantee for the safety of member states is still distant and uncertain.</p>
<p>Seeking peace by expecting disarmament, seeking disarmament by expecting treaties. If one disarmament treaty is insufficient, then expecting all kinds of security conventions. The Kellogg-Briand Pact for Peace has not been signed for long. Because the Peace Pact is not enough to guarantee peace, they seek guarantees in the London Naval Treaty and various other treaties. The more treaty restrictions, the less sincerity, and the weaker the effectiveness will be. Although, the completion of a treaty requires countless efforts of mind, time, and verbal disputes. Just like the completion of this naval treaty, it went through three months of the London Conference, not to mention the pre-planning and preparation. Before the London Conference, there were various conferences such as Washington and Geneva, which took up how much effort, time, and verbal disputes. Adding other various expenses, it cannot be said that it is not a great sacrifice in efforts for peace. However, the result obtained is only this. Then we can only attribute it to the workings of the world. How dare I blame the incompleteness of human efforts?</p>

Recently, Yan has again used the Cangshi Railway and the mining areas of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces as collateral to borrow large amounts of foreign debt from imperialists to fund his military expenses, disregarding the suffering of the people and the nation's peril. It is an act of betrayal and humiliation. Upon hearing the news, we are filled with indignation. We hope that all comrades and compatriots throughout the country will rise up and fight vigorously, resolutely oppose it, and unanimously request the Central Government to warn all countries not to conclude any treaties with Yan and to quickly send troops to suppress the rebellion, eliminate the traitors, and restore national sovereignty.

<p>Important International News</p>
<h3>Emergency in Tibet</h3>
<p>Great Undercurrent Underway Between Britain and Russia in Central Asia</p>
<p>Another Tinderbox in International Politics</p>
<p>The World Society translates the English Herald as saying: According to news from Central Asia, a malicious international conspiracy is reviving there. The details and extent of the conspiracy are unknown, but there is no doubt that Central Asia is now another tinderbox in international politics. The most recent brief report on this matter is a telegram from the Moscow TASS news agency dated April 7, which is a formal response from the Soviet Union. Because TASS is under the control of the Russian government, it would never allow any news detrimental to the Soviet Union to be disseminated. As for its purpose, it is almost the same as what it criticizes. The telegram states: (According to a report from Constantinople, British imperialism is greatly active in Central Asia and is now using various methods to create a ring of resistance against the Soviet Union on its eastern border. The Tibetan Plateau leading to Kashgar and Tajikistan is receiving the most attention from the British. According to Indian newspapers, the British government is taking advantage of the minor dispute between Nepal and Tibet to incite Nepal to sever relations with Tibet. The British are clearly attempting to use the current situation to advance into Tibet and bring Tibet entirely under their control.) Nepal is located between Tibet and India and considers itself an independent country. Tibet's stance wavers between being pro-British and pro-Chinese. The Soviet Union borders Tibet and has always had the ambition to encroach on India. Britain is aware of this, so whether it has aggressive intentions towards Tibet or not, it wants to establish a buffer state between India and the Soviet Union. At the same time, because Nepal and Tibet block the Soviet Union's path for propaganda into India, Britain's increased attention to the region makes it more difficult for Russia to invade India. Therefore, Russia is taking the opportunity to greatly denounce British imperialism. In short, in the distant Tibet and Nepal, a profound undercurrent is underway, which is of great relevance to China.</p>
<h3>Riots in Chittagong and Tiperrah</h3>
<p>Troops Dispatched for Suppression</p>
<p>More People Arrested</p>
<p>Reuters, Calcutta, 26th: A government gazette states that two detachments of Assam Rifles arrived in Chittagong today.

Police in Feni, northeast of Chittagong, saw several people on a train suspected of being involved in the Chittagong</p>
<p>riots and attempted to arrest them, but the passengers suddenly pulled out pistols and escaped. Twenty-one of these people have now been arrested in Moahali.</p>
<p>Reuters, North Siaha, 27th: According to an official announcement, the total number of deaths and injuries in the recent riots is twenty dead and about thirty being treated in hospitals.</p>
<p>Japanese Parliament</p>
<h3>Fierce Questioning and Debate</h3>
<p>Government Responses Lack Sincerity</p>
<p>Provoking Criticism from Opposition Parties</p>
<p>Naval Reduction Plan to Become a Focal Point of Dispute</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 27th: Today the Upper House was adjourned, and the Lower House is expected to have a heated questioning session. The questioning will begin with Mr. Yukio Ozaki's remarks on the Kobashi issue. Mr. Zenbei Horikiri, Mr. Sanji Muto, and Mr. Ikuo Oyama will each raise questions. Answering questions on the unemployment issue is the most difficult problem for the government, and it is currently being carefully studied. After the questioning ends, a vote of no confidence will be proposed by the Seiyukai during the budget general meeting, which will further question the government.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th: Yesterday, the attitude of Prime Minister Hamaguchi and Foreign Minister Shidehara in their speeches and answers at the formal meetings of both houses was very different from that in the previous parliament. They were extremely rude and arrogant, and lacked sincerity. Therefore, the atmosphere in the Upper House suddenly deteriorated. Many considered Prime Minister Hamaguchi's answers and Foreign Minister Shidehara's statement ("Those who do not support the naval reduction compromise do not understand the world situation") as an insult to their earnest questioning. They believed that the government should not rely on its absolute majority and adopt such an insolent attitude. In particular, the Kenkyukai stated that it must strongly criticize the government's attitude and decided to add additional questions. It has already notified the Upper House Secretariat of its intention to submit questions.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th: The Japanese government, in view of the short session and many important bills in the special parliament, has decided to limit the questioning of ministers of state to the 27th. On the 28th, at the formal meeting, the bill to amend the law on national treasury support for compulsory education expenses will be put on the agenda and completed by the 4th of next month. If the opposition parties use delaying tactics, the meeting will continue until midnight and provide opportunities to speak in order to advance the proceedings. However, the Seiyukai's intention to extend the questioning of ministers of state for another two days will likely cause an uproar.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 27th: The attacks from both houses on the government will now focus on the London Naval Treaty, questioning whether the government can guarantee national defense with this treaty. As a result, the Upper House suddenly became tense, with the Koseikai taking the first shot, and various factions of the Policy Research Council also wanting to launch attacks. If Naval Minister Takarabe returns to the country during the parliamentary session, the problem will become even more complicated. Chief of the Naval General Staff Kato and his deputy have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government, and after seeing Prime Minister Hamaguchi's and Foreign Minister Shidehara's speeches on the 25th, they decided not to endure it any longer and will resign on the grounds that they cannot plan national defense. It is said that this will happen after Naval Minister Takarabe returns to the country. The government leaders will also take a tough</p>
<p>stance, arguing that the Naval General Staff had already understood before the treaty was signed, and there is no legal or moral fault to be found. However, even if the government can defeat the opposition parties and the Upper House, which are taking the opportunity to resist, softening its attitude towards the Privy Council is also a major challenge. Dentsu, Tokyo, 27th: In view of the criticism of Naval Minister Takarabe, Prime Minister Hamaguchi decided to send Naval Ministry Senior Aide-de-Camp Colonel Koga to Changchun or Harbin to meet him on the way and inform him of the situation in the country in order to handle the anti-Takarabe fervor well. The Naval General Staff, on the other hand, said that they would wait for the Naval Minister to return to the country and then request a meeting of the Military Council.</p>
<h3>Naval Convention Delivered to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th: British Prime Minister MacDonald sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations on April 21, enclosing a copy of the London Naval Convention.

The candidates for this seat are Pomfield for the Labour Party and Scott for the Conservative Party. The Liberal Party has not nominated a candidate, so political observers speculate that there is some kind of coalition between the Liberal Party and the Labour Party.</p>

When it flew over the White Hart Lane stadium in England, it was during the English football final.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Mongolian Committee</h3>
<p>Plan to Improve Mongolian Commerce</p>
<p>The Design Committee of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission recently stated that the decline of Mongolian commerce is due to the crudeness of Mongolian goods and the lack of intelligence of merchants, who do not know how to improve them. In addition, inconvenient transportation and heavy taxes, and recently the oppression and aggression of red and white imperialism, have led to the increasing exhaustion of Mongolian commerce. To save it, several measures have been drafted and submitted to the 55th regular meeting of the Mongolian Committee for approval and will be submitted for discussion after the opening of the Mongolian Conference. The measures are as follows: (1) A thorough investigation of Mongolian products and their sales status. (2) An investigation of the status of foreign investment in Mongolian commerce. (3) The establishment of commercial schools in major Mongolian trading ports to provide general young people with relevant commercial education. Once Mongolians have commercial knowledge, they will naturally be able to innovate and transform crudeness into quality. All Mongolian natural products, such as cattle and sheep hides, should be made into tanned leather or leather goods, milk should be made into condensed milk, wool should be woven into woolen fabrics, and rock salt should be bleached into refined salt. Once the goods are improved, commerce will naturally flourish. (4) The establishment of product display halls in major Mongolian trading ports so that merchants and the public can understand the quality and price of goods and know what to choose. (5) The establishment of a commercial federation in important and prosperous areas of Mongolia to enable Mongolian merchants to connect with each other and jointly plan methods of commodity sales and transportation. (6) Exchanges can activate finance and circulate goods, and should be established in Kulun, Chakhtu, Chifeng, Zhangjiakou, Taonan, Suiyuan, and Baotou in Mongolia. (7) The establishment of consumer cooperatives is intended to enable social organizations to distribute consumer goods, eliminating merchant monopolies. As a result, domestic goods can be sold well and prices can be low. (8) The decline of Mongolian commerce is actually due to heavy inland taxes. If we want Mongolian goods to sell well, we must first reduce cargo donations and taxes. (9) Transportation is inconvenient, especially in Mongolia. Transportation costs are high, making promotion difficult. Therefore, transportation costs should be reduced. (10) Mongolian commerce is invaded by Japanese goods in the east and oppressed by Soviet Russia in the north, resulting in a flood of foreign goods and the stagnation of domestic goods. The way to resist this is to increase the import tax on foreign goods. (11) Recently, the Mongolian commercial power has been controlled by Soviet Russia, and foreign Mongolian commerce has been monopolized by two Soviet-Russian trade companies. Beaver, fox, wolf, gray squirrel, and sable furs from Outer Mongolia are marked as not allowed for Chinese merchants to buy. Recently, it has been rumored that camel and sheep wool are also prohibited from being purchased by Chinese merchants. The Soviet government has also established a transportation company in Outer Mongolia to export Mongolian products and import Russian products. The economic suction is truly astonishing. Not only is Outer Mongolian commerce exclusively occupied by Soviet Russia, but also the Inner Mongolian cities of Zhangjiakou and Suiyuan, as well as the Tianjin and Beijing areas, are suffering greatly in commerce. To save this problem and prevent foreign monopoly, a trade company and a transportation company should be established in Mongolia as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Report</h3>
<p>The Course of Negotiations over Weihaiwei</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, Bao Jingan, Section Chief of the Intelligence Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, went to the Central Broadcasting Station to report on the recent diplomatic situation. He reported in detail on the course of negotiations over Weihaiwei and the content of the agreement. Excerpts are as follows: (The most important event of the past week was the signing of the agreement to recover the Weihaiwei leased territory. The importance of this event is the first successful step in China's recovery of leased territories. Now, I will briefly report on the course of negotiations over Weihaiwei. Weihaiwei is located in southeastern Shandong, facing Lushun and Dalian across the Bohai Bay. Liugong Island lies in front, making it the best ice-free port in North China. During the 24th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (i.e., 1898 AD), Russia leased Lushun and Dalian, and Germany leased Jiaozhou</p>
<p>. Britain used the excuse of defending against Russia and Germany to forcibly lease Weihaiwei for stationing troops. The original lease term was 25 years, expiring in the 12th year of the Republic of China (i.e., 1923 AD). At the Washington Conference in 1921, British representative Balfour stated that he was willing to return Weihaiwei to China. The following year, the 11th year of the Republic of China, the Beijing government sent Liang Ruhao to negotiate with the British representative on the method of recovery and to conclude an agreement of 24 articles. The content of the agreement had many inappropriate points, and it ultimately failed to be signed due to public opposition. In the 12th year, Gu Weijun separately concluded an agreement of 29 articles and obtained the consent of both governments, but it failed to be signed due to a political change, and its content was also not very appropriate. After the National Government unified the country, it actively proceeded with negotiations to recover Weihaiwei. Foreign Minister Wang proposed a draft last November. Regarding the issue of lending a portion of the houses on Liugong Island to British sailors for summer residence, Minister Wang proposed that there was no need to conclude such a contract separately and that the return of Weihaiwei was one matter, and the borrowing of houses was another matter, with a borrowing period of five years. China could recover the houses at any time. Because the British side did not agree, the matter was delayed. In February of this year, consultations were resumed. British Minister Lampson sent the draft agreement to London for instructions. Recently, Minister Lampson came south with orders from the British government and, after further consultations, although the summer housing on Liugong Island was still leased for a period of ten years, China had complete control over whether to renew the lease. Moreover, China could convert it into a military port at any time, which was very different from the previous draft. The agreement was formally signed on the evening of the 18th of this month. This is a general overview of the course of negotiations over Weihaiwei. The agreement concluded this time is divided into two parts: the main agreement and the supplementary agreement. The main agreement is divided into 20 articles and two attachments, and the supplementary agreement has six articles. The main agreement is a special document for the recovery of Weihaiwei and includes a list of state properties in Weihaiwei city transferred by the British government. The important points include: (1) The administrative management rights of Weihaiwei and Liugong Island are completely returned to China. (2) All buildings, electric lights, telephones, police uniforms, firearms, lighthouses, and buoys in Weihaiwei are transferred to China completely free of charge. (3) British private property in Weihaiwei can still be retained, but if China wants to rebuild Weihaiwei into a military port, the Chinese government can redeem it at a price determined by a committee organized by China and Britain. (4) In the future, litigation cases in Weihaiwei will be handled by Chinese courts. The supplementary agreement is entirely devoted to the Liugong Island issue, which stipulates that China allows the British to borrow a portion of the houses on Liugong Island as a summer resort for the navy, with a fixed term of ten years. However, within the ten-year period, if China wants to convert it into a military port, it can unconditionally recover the housing. This agreement stipulates that it will be ratified by the governments of both countries before October of this year, and it will take effect from the date of ratification. The content of the agreement to recover Weihaiwei is roughly like this. The original text will be published simultaneously by both parties within days.)</p>

<h3>Message to Workers for Labor Day (Continued)</h3>
<p>Since we recognize that China is an industrially backward country, with only a division of labor between labor and capital and no class of labor and capital, the class struggle advocated by the counter-revolutionary communists who exploit workers is nothing more than an attempt to use workers to create social poverty and terror, to practice their "min-si-ism" (doctrine of the people's death). Where are they seeking the interests of their fellow workers? When they need workers as their pawns and tools, they use sweet words and flattery to deceive and win over workers and use them for their own purposes. They either command them to do things like murder and arson, or they drive them to be their flag-waving and shouting demonstrators, disrupting social order and undermining the construction of our party, in order to offer their achievements to their motherland, Soviet Russia, and be rewarded. The money they have collected and defrauded in the localities, in workers' organizations, and in Soviet Russia is nothing more than to fill their own pockets. They verbally say that they want to overthrow capitalists, but they themselves imitate capitalists every day. In all aspects of life, such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, they seek only comfort and pleasure. Where do they care about our hard-working and suffering workers? In the past, who among the famous people in the communist movement who engaged in worker movements was not like this? We workers have suffered countless harms from them. This is already known and hated by the people of the whole country. If we Chinese workers want to obtain our own interests and liberation, we should uphold the spirit of labor-capital cooperation, be loyal to our duties, strive for technical excellence, improve manufacturing, and increase production, so as to develop the national economy. At the same time, under the leadership of our party, we should strive to overthrow the great enemies of worker liberation: international capital imperialism and the Chinese Communist Party, and the reorganized factions that deceive workers. This is the correct and only way out for us Chinese workers. We must also recognize that the Chinese Nationalist Party is the only revolutionary party that represents the interests of the oppressed people and strives for them, especially the interests of the workers. From the time of the late Premier in Japan until now, it has been constantly seeking ways to help and improve them. In the past year, when our party's government began political tutelage after eliminating warlords, it has been engaged in abolishing unequal treaties, recovering customs, and recovering concessions externally, striving to improve the international position and lift the shackles of international economic forces. Internally, it has been protecting industry, abolishing transit taxes, reforming the tax system, promoting domestic goods, and developing other businesses that are beneficial to production. It has made great efforts in drafting the Factory Law, the Trade Union Law, the Labor Dispute Handling Law, and various labor laws and regulations, in determining the Labor Entertainment, Hygiene, and Education Program, in advocating labor insurance, and in preparing for worker cooperation businesses. It can be seen that our party's government has always cared for us hard-working workers and has never discriminated against them. Unfortunately, the traitorous military leaders of the rebel party, Li Zongren, Feng Yuxiang, Zhang Fakui, and Tang Shengzhi, relied on their personal selfish desires, relied on red and white imperialism as their shield, and rebelled with soldiers to disrupt unity, causing construction projects to suffer repeated setbacks and the people's suffering to remain unresolved. Recently, Yan Xishan has colluded with all corrupt and evil forces to form a reactionary group, deploying troops to defy the central government, and the newly stabilized party and country are once again presenting a dangerous situation of disturbance. The progress of political tutelage and construction is even more obstructed. In the past revolutionary process, we workers were the earliest to become aware, our unity was very strong, and we helped the revolution greatly. Now, at the time when all reactionary forces are reviving and making their last struggle, it is precisely the time for workers to work hard for the revolution and completely eliminate reactionary forces. Workers across the country, we should unite as we did before, wholeheartedly support the central government, and under the guidance of our party, strive to eliminate the traitors who betray the central government and undermine unity, fundamentally eradicate the warlords and communists who hinder construction and abuse the people, so that the revolutionary government can implement good laws and continue construction work to ensure our peace and improve our lives. Only then can society be stable, industry can develop, the international position can be improved, the suffering of workers can be alleviated, and the entire nation can be liberated. This is the recognition and effort we should have in commemorating May Day. I hope that my dear workers will encourage each other. (The End)</p>
<h3>Hangzhou General Chamber of Commerce Requests Maintenance of Foil Industry</h3>
<p>Relating to the Livelihood of Over One Million Men and Women Workers</p>
<p>Temporarily Suspend the Ban Before Formulating Measures</p>
<p>Today (27th), the Hangzhou General Chamber of Commerce submitted a joint petition to the National Government's Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stating that on April 20 of this year, the Hangzhou Foil Industry Association stated that it had read in the newspaper that the Ministry of Interior planned to ban industries dealing in superstitious articles within one year, and had promulgated six articles of the ban, ordering the provincial governments to comply accordingly. The association was shocked and bewildered upon reading this. Although the burning of tin foil is a superstitious practice, its production is actually a major industry in Zhejiang Province. According to statistics, the number of male and female foil workers in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo has reached more than one million, and there are even more people who indirectly rely on this for a living. At a time when disasters are frequent year after year, the five major exports of Zhejiang Province, silk, tea, paper, and foil, have been repeatedly hit by international trends, the impact of the tide, and the burden of heavy taxes, all of which have fallen into a state of failure, resulting in an increasing number of unemployed workers and greater suffering for the people. The government should uphold the late Premier's Principle of People's Livelihood, devise ways to support inherent production, increase people's wealth, and stabilize society, and all reforms should be carried out step by step. However, upon careful examination of the internal provisions, there are statements such as "those engaged in superstitious articles industries must switch to other industries within one year." It is noted that although tin foil is one of the superstitious articles, it is related to the livelihood of more than one million foil workers, and the matter is of great importance. If the government does not have perfect relief methods, but only issues a written order to force a change of industry, it is not only that social order will be immediately disrupted, but also that the majority of our one million male and female foil workers come from the fields, lacking the ability to automatically change industries and not having suitable farmland for cultivation. If their livelihoods are cut off, the strong will inevitably take risks and be used by others, and the weak will inevitably fill the ditches and become starved corpses, which is not what a government eagerly seeking governance should do. Moreover, the people's worship of ancestors and gods, and the burning of tin foil, has been a custom for thousands of years. Although the matter is superstitious, it is sufficient to respect the virtuous ancestors and promote filial piety, which is not without benefit to the world and people's hearts. At this time of political tutelage, the government should first strive to maintain social stability and increase production. Banning superstitious articles is not an urgent task, and in practice, it is impossible to adopt a gradual policy. It will be difficult to achieve results until the constitutional period of national prosperity. In his speech at the National Government's Premier's Memorial Week on the 7th of this month, Chairman Chiang also recognized that banning the burning of paper ash would inevitably increase the number of unemployed workers in society if implemented before the government had perfect measures, which is a pertinent point. The relevant ministries and governments should earnestly implement this. The association, because the matter is related to the livelihood of all foil workers, in addition to submitting separate petitions to the National Government's Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, appealing for their hardships and complying with the virtue announced by Chairman Chiang, and temporarily suspending the ban until the government has prepared large-scale factories to accommodate unemployed foil workers, it is appropriate to submit the above-mentioned reasons and petition the association to sympathize with the difficulties of commerce, and to call for support on behalf of the association, so that our more than one million foil workers may have a way to continue their lives. This would not only be fortunate for our industry, but also preserve some vitality for Zhejiang Province. We tearfully submit our petition and humbly ask for your consideration. It is noted that although foil is a superstitious article, the number of men and women in Zhejiang Province who rely on it for a livelihood is no less than one million. At present, when large-scale factories have not yet been established, workers are suffering from unemployment. If the ban is suddenly enforced, the majority of foil workers will inevitably starve to death as a result. The dangerous situation is unimaginable. According to the aforementioned circumstances, it is appropriate to submit this document and respectfully request your government to examine and approve it, and to temporarily suspend implementation in order to show compassion and provide support, which is truly convenient for the public.</p>

<h3>Rebellious Troops Under Zhou Travel and Flee into Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>A Fuzhou dispatch reports that Zhou Zhiqun, the Brigade Commander of the 36th Brigade of the 12th Division under Jin Handing, suddenly led the 71st Regiment in a rebellion in Gucheng, Changting, on the Fujian border some months ago. They fled into Ruijin on the Jiangxi border, cutting off communication lines between the two provinces to isolate news. They then engaged in widespread looting, causing significant losses to the local area. After Tang Brigade of the same division dispatched troops to intercept them, only about a thousand remnants remained. They then moved from Ruijin to Shicheng and retreated to Ninghua on the Fujian border. Some of the troops invaded Qingliu. Although the 1st Brigade under Lu Xinming of the provincial defense forces was stationed there, they were repeatedly attacked by communist bandits and plagued by internal strife, making their strength weak and insufficient to cope with the situation. As a result, Jianning and Shaowu in northern Fujian were greatly shaken. The newly formed 2nd Division under Lu Xingbang, stationed in northern Fujian, is now dispatching large units to Jianning, Yong'an, and Guihua counties to block them. At the same time, the Tang Brigade of Jin's division has sent a regiment of troops from Ruijin into Fujian to pursue and attack them in Ninghua. They have also requested that Lu's division send a regiment of troops from Yong'an to Qingliu to intercept them head-on, attacking them from both sides to surround and disarm them. Lu's division has already dispatched the Huang Qingcai Regiment. However, the troop deployment requires significant funds, so they have telegraphed the provincial government requesting an immediate allocation of 50,000 yuan for bandit suppression. The provincial government, citing the extreme financial difficulties of Fujian Province, has telegraphed the National Government to inquire whether this bandit suppression fund should be allocated. If it should be allocated, they request that the Ministry of Finance immediately arrange for the funds to be transferred to the division for use. The Jin Handing Division has now completely withdrawn from western Fujian to eastern Jiangxi. However, due to the pursuit of the rebellious troops, border stations on the boundaries of the two provinces have not yet been dismantled. (April 22nd)</p>
<p>Li Yunheng's Telegraph Report</p>
<h3>Circumstances of Suppressing Communist Bandits in Jianli and Mianyang</h3>
<p>All Red Army Routes Have Been Defeated</p>
<p>A Hankou dispatch reports that Li Yunheng, the Division Commander of the 53rd Division, telegraphed He Chengjun, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, from Shayang military camp on the 24th, reporting on the situation of his unit suppressing bandits in Mianyang and Jianli. The original telegram is as follows: (1) Respectful regards to Chairman He of the Wuchang Provincial Government. I have received a report from Regiment Commander Li Qinghuan of my division from Xinkou Village, Jianli, on the 18th, stating: "1. After I led my troops to Longwan, I received reports that the communist bandits defeated by us at Majiase on the 20th had fled to Laoxinkou and attacked and defeated the local defense team. At the same time, they also attacked and defeated the Xinkou Village defense team in Jianli. They mobilized three to four thousand farmers in Mianyang to parade and demonstrate. They set up a pontoon bridge on the Jing River, kidnapping and extorting money, hoping to make a comeback. 2. I led my troops to depart from Longwan at dawn today in the rain. The roads were muddy and difficult to travel. At 1:00 PM, we reached Yuyang Town and first defeated the vanguard of the bandits. We then launched a fierce attack on Xinkou Village. The communist bandits resisted desperately but were eventually defeated. A small part fled into Mianyang territory, and the majority fled along the right bank of the Jing River. I further encouraged the officers and soldiers to take advantage of their chaos and pursue them closely. At about 4:00 PM, we defeated them in Yanglin Town, Mianyang, and at 6:00 PM, we defeated them again at Beikou, Jianli. We only stopped to camp after dusk. 3. The rapid suppression by my regiment today led to the defeat of the communist bandits. They were unable to regroup and lost contact with each other. Most of them disguised themselves as civilians, and many weapons were abandoned in the Jing River and wheat fields. A small part seemed to have fled back to their old nest in Honghu along the Yubei Dyke. War flags, armbands, and corpses were scattered along the way, a truly miserable sight. My unit is currently checking the captured weapons and consumed ammunition." Respectfully submitted, Li Yunheng bows. (2) I have also received a report from Regiment Commander Li Qinghuan from Laoxinkou on the 20th, stating: "1. My regiment returned to Laoxinkou to clear the area and dispatched Li Battalion to chase the remaining bandits in Li's Village. 2. The 6th Army of the Red Army disintegrated along the way after being defeated by my regiment. The remnants fled back to their old nest in Honghu in disarray. According to the prisoners, the Red Army suffered over six hundred deaths. Only two to three hundred rifles remained besides those lost, captured, or sunk in the water. 3. In the battle on the 20th, my regiment killed over three hundred communist bandits. Those confirmed as prisoners were all executed by firing squad. We captured fifteen rifles, nine carbines, one hundred and fifty-one rounds of ammunition, and countless flags and slogans. My unit suffered two soldiers killed and eight wounded. Ammunition consumption included over seventy-five thousand rounds of rifle ammunition and over thirty thousand rounds of machine gun ammunition. 4. After my unit defeated the Red Army, we were welcomed everywhere we went. We are now actively clearing the area and have temporarily ordered local gentry to organize defense teams for self-defense." Respectfully submitted, Li Yunheng bows. (April 25th)</p>
<h3>Local Autonomy in Hubei Province Underway</h3>
<p>Regulations for Dividing Counties into Districts Specified</p>
<p>Deadline for Completion by End of June</p>
<p>A Hankou dispatch reports that Wu Xingya, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Hubei Province, stated that all counties in the province should have begun delineating autonomous regions and compiling autonomous townships since December of last year. Previously, due to the lack of security, talent, and funding in various counties, personnel were only assigned to prepare in advance in twenty counties, including Wuchang. The remaining forty-eight counties, including Chongyang, had not yet begun. Now, the central government is strictly urging the completion of county organization and the deadline for autonomous progress. Therefore, ten regulations have been drafted and instructed to the county magistrates of the forty-eight counties, including Chongyang, to be responsible for delineating the autonomous regions of their respective counties and to submit detailed maps and explanations to the department within one month from the date of receiving the document. The department will then appoint district chiefs according to the number of districts divided in each county. In any case, the district offices must be established in June of this year. The method for dividing the districts is as follows: (1) Each county must be divided into at least four districts and no more than eight districts. (2) After receiving the district division method, the county magistrate shall convene a meeting of all legal entities and the heads of the district defense teams in the county within ten days to decide on the number of districts and the location of the district offices based on terrain convenience, population size, and economic conditions. (3) After the number of districts and the location of the district offices are determined, the county magistrate shall appoint one investigator for each district to go to each district to delineate district boundaries in conjunction with the group protection chiefs, and local gentry. (4) If a dispute arises during the delineation of district boundaries, the investigator shall submit it to the county government for resolution. If a dispute arises with a neighboring county, the county magistrates of the respective counties shall resolve it together. If the local people are not satisfied with the previous resolution, they may request the Civil Affairs Department for handling through the county magistrates of the respective counties. (5) If the county borders are intertwined or jagged, they should be neatly divided. All land taxes should be separately managed and submitted to the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments for verification and approval.</p>
<p>Preparation of Records. (6) After the district boundaries have been delineated, the investigators shall prepare detailed maps and explanations and submit them to the county government, which shall then prepare a master map and explanations and submit them to the Civil Affairs Department for verification and recordation. (7) The district division expenses shall be 200 yuan for first-class counties, 160 yuan for second-class counties, and 120 yuan for third-class counties, which shall be paid from the autonomous expenses of the respective counties. If the autonomous expenses are misappropriated, the county magistrate shall find a way to raise the money first, and then allocate it back on time. (8) The district division matters must be completed within one month from the date of receiving the order. (9) After the implementation of this method, all counties must follow the time limit and may not seek to extend it on the grounds of special circumstances. (10) This method shall be abolished on the date of completion of the district division. (April 25th)</p>
<h3>Recent Reasons for High Rice Prices in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>A Guangzhou dispatch reports that rice prices in Guangdong Province have been exceptionally high from early spring to the present. Inferior imported rice bran (called "mi lu" in the local dialect) only yields eleven catties per yuan. Other palatable rice yields only six to seven catties per yuan. Therefore, the issue of high rice prices has attracted widespread attention, and social life has become increasingly difficult. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau recently convened representatives from rice shops, industry, and commerce to discuss and jointly maintain the result. It was resolved that rice merchants should not be allowed to hoard and monopolize rice, and rice workers should be prohibited from collecting commissions as a temporary measure. The fundamental solution is to encourage the improvement of farming techniques to increase grain production. Subsequently, the provincial government ordered the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Departments to jointly formulate relief measures. Each department sent special commissioners, such as Feng, to be responsible for investigation. According to the reply, after receiving the order, these commissioners went to the Rice Bran Trade Association to conduct on-site investigations of merchants hoarding grain as a standard for studying and cracking down on grain measures. It was also found that improper consumption of grain in the province is mainly used for winemaking. The Guangdong Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau was investigated to determine the amount of rice used for winemaking in Guangdong to study and curb improper consumption. The results of these two investigations show that the fundamental solution to the province's grain problem cannot be achieved solely by cracking down on hoarding and improper consumption. The province's grain has always been mainly rice. The province's own rice production is not sufficient each year. One-quarter is imported from Zhenjiang, Wuhu, and Annan and Siam. These foreign rice are all purchased and transported by mainland rice merchants. Sometimes, even if the crops in various prefectures fail, this source of supply can prevent severe famine. This is different from provinces with inconvenient transportation, such as Shaanxi and Gansu, which rely entirely on grain produced within the province. Furthermore, there are originally many rice bran shops in the province. Due to trade competition, their business not only has no way to monopolize, but also cannot make a profit. Many have closed down last year due to business stagnation. If cracking down is implemented again, then purchasing, transporting, and selling will all need to be registered, and purchase and sale prices will need to be audited. The shops will feel that it is too difficult, and few will not switch to other businesses. If there are fewer rice merchants, it will be more difficult to meet supply and demand in the event of a famine. Therefore, the crackdown on grain in this province is not wrong, but improper handling may greatly affect the future of people's food. Also, the amount of wine brewed in this province is about 88,608,000 catties, using about 83,996,160 catties of rice. The quantity is very large. However, the rice used for winemaking is mostly the coarsest silk rice produced in deep-water farmland, mostly unsuitable for regular food use. About two-thirds of the wine sales are in the province, and the remaining one-third is sold overseas. If it is cracked down in a quantity, then local goods will be eliminated, and foreign wines will take the opportunity to increase their imports. The impact on foreign trade and alcohol tax revenue is not insignificant. Based on these reasons, the officials discussed the results and stated that the crackdown on grain in this province has special circumstances. It seems that it cannot be handled carefully. For the sake of fundamental relief and easy implementation, in addition to actively encouraging land reclamation and improving agriculture to increase production and enrich the people's food, it seems appropriate to first issue an order to all counties and cities that if there is a drought or flood in the future, causing food shortages and panic, they should immediately investigate the specific circumstances and formulate temporary measures to relieve and suppress grain measures, and submit them for approval and execution, so as to adapt to the times and avoid the difficult mistakes. Experienced rice merchants also said that the recent reasons for the high rice prices in Guangdong Province are not one-sided, and the recent impacts are: First, the inland business community is declining, and finances are short. At the same time, the rice industry is also affected by capital, which is difficult to turn around. The amount of rice purchased from Southeast Asia has decreased accordingly. Less imported rice in the mainland, and demand exceeds supply, so rice prices have risen sharply. Second, imported rice has arrived in smaller quantities, and at the same time, the customs has implemented a de facto increase in the import tax rate on rice, and the cost of imported rice to the mainland is slightly more expensive than before. Third, in addition to relying on imported rice, Guangdong Province also relies on the import of Zhenjiang and Wuhu rice. Now there are military operations in the Yangtze River, and Zhenwu rice has been requisitioned and purchased, and the amount of rice shipped to Guangdong has decreased sharply. Fourth, Guangdong Province also relies on the transport of Guangxi local rice on weekdays. At present, the war in Guangxi has reached a stalemate, and the source of Gui rice has been cut off. Based on the above four reasons, imported rice has arrived in smaller quantities, and the cost is expensive. Rice from other provinces has even cut off the source. Guangdong's own rice is not enough to feed itself on weekdays. Once it encounters the above-mentioned impact, rice prices have to skyrocket. (April 15th)</p>
<h3>Details of the Loss of the Japanese Ship Shinkichi Maru</h3>
<p>Hit a Reef in the Waters Between Shantou and Hong Kong</p>
<p>Crew Rescued, Cargo Looted by Pirates</p>
<p>A Xiamen dispatch from the 23rd reports that the Japanese ship Shinkichi Maru, which was sailing between Keelung, Taiwan, and Guangdong, ran aground near the Lamoods Lighthouse between Shantou and Hong Kong on the 20th of this month and was looted by pirates. The crew was rescued by the Guangli ship. Previously, the ship departed from Keelung at 2:00 PM on the 18th, carrying over one thousand tons of Mitsui coal and other cargo, heading south. On the afternoon of the 20th, it reached the sea area at the junction of Hong Kong and Shantou. At that time, there was dense fog and high winds. The captain knew that he had approached the Lamoods Lighthouse, which had many hidden reefs. He slowed down to avoid the lighthouse. Unexpectedly, at the sea surface three nautical miles from the lighthouse, the whole ship suddenly vibrated and stopped moving forward. Knowing that it had run aground, it immediately sounded its whistle for help, but no ship came around. At that time, the ship was tilting and the deck was broken, and seawater was pouring in, making the situation extremely dangerous. The captain urgently sent out a radio distress signal and launched three lifeboats carrying twenty-seven crew members (ten Japanese and seventeen Chinese). At that time, the fog was thicker and the wind was stronger. The three boats drifted in the sea, fortunately approaching the lighthouse. The British who guarded the lighthouse (five or six) had heard the distress whistle when the Shinkichi Maru encountered danger. However, because the fog was dense, they could not determine the location of the ship. When the crew members arrived at the tower to ask for help, the tower keepers were unable to provide assistance because the fog had not cleared. By the next morning (21st morning), the fog cleared, and the British guarding the lighthouse went to see the ship with the crew members. There, the ship was surrounded by several sailing boats, and over twenty pirates were boarding the ship for looting. Fearing being captured by the pirates, they dared not get close. When the pirates left, the Guangli ship happened to pass by, and the lighthouse fired a cannon for help. The twenty-seven crew members then came to Xiamen on the Guangli and stayed at the Yantian Hotel in Gulangyu. On the 22nd, they reported the disaster to the Japanese consulate. According to the captain, Matsuda Kumaji, the Shinkichi Maru was badly damaged and was decided to be abandoned, with losses of approximately over 120,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Relocating Henan and Zhejiang Immigrants to the Northeast</h3>
<p>A Harbin dispatch reports that there is a lot of wasteland in the Northeast that urgently needs to be reclaimed. In recent years, natural disasters and man-made disasters in China have made it difficult for people to live. The authorities, in view of this, have tried their best to measure and release wasteland in various counties and widely recruit refugees from various provinces to reclaim it. As a result, no less than one million mu of wasteland is reclaimed every year, and hundreds of thousands of refugees are settled. This is the largest construction in the Northeast. In March of this year, the Henan Provincial Government and Disaster Relief Association planned to immigrate 130,000 people to Heilongjiang Province in the East Province after the thaw. The Jiang Province Government believed that although there was a lot of wasteland, it was not easy to settle a large number of refugees at once, so it presented a plan to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee for approval. The Political Affairs Committee has now decided that 60,000 people will be settled starting in May. The Jiang Province will select suitable locations and provide proper reception. The Jiang Provincial Government is currently preparing everything. The first batch of immigrants from Zhejiang Province to the Northeast will consist of 400 households, totaling 1,700 to 1,800 people. They departed from Shanghai on the 20th of this month and are expected to arrive in Yingkou around the 25th. Commander Zhang Xueliang has dispatched the County Magistrate of Yingkou to receive everything and has telegraphed the Jiang Provincial Government to select a location for settlement. After discussion by the Jiang Provincial Government, the counties of 　North, Tangyuan, Wuyun, and Tailai were designated as Zhejiang farmland. There are many rivers in these four counties, and there are many places where rice paddies can be cultivated. With the Zhejiang people's expertise in rice planting, it is expected that great achievements will be made in a few years. (Zhen Dan News Agency)</p>

<p>Harbin Discovery</p>
<h3>Russian Hiding Large Quantities of Landmines</h3>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: During the Sino-Russian conflict last year, treacherous elements of Red Russia hid in Harbin and along the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) line, plotting to blow up the railway of the Eastern Provinces, disrupt our country's transportation, and disturb the peace and order of Harbin. Military police conducted thorough searches, and several cases were uncovered one after another. Later, with the cessation of hostilities between China and Russia, these troublemakers began to conceal their activities. However, landmines and bombs were hidden in the homes of Russian residents everywhere. The source of these explosives was said to be either from the Soviet Union itself or manufactured by Russians working in the CER factories. Unexpectedly, just as the Sino-Russian conference was about to open, a large number of landmines were discovered hidden in a Russian's home in Harbin. The 18th Squadron of the 5th Gendarmerie Brigade dispatched numerous gendarmes to search and apprehended the Russian householder, seizing nine landmines (each weighing approximately eight "hua jin," shaped like large artillery shells). The Russian and the landmines have now been sent to Jilin for interrogation. A detailed account of the case's uncovering is provided below:</p>
<p>Brief Biography of the Householder: The Russian, named Fulo Lauv, is the head of Russian iron factories. He is 61 years old and a White Russian. Previously, he worked as a craftsman in the CER factory and is skilled in design. He is capable of manufacturing explosives such as landmines and bombs. During the Sino-Russian conflict last year, treacherous elements of Red Russia caused major disturbances, burying landmines along the CER line to blow up CER vehicles. These landmines used by Red Russia were, in addition to being manufactured in Harbin, also shipped from the Soviet Union in advance. Because the Russian, Fulo Lauv, worked in iron, members of the Red Party often visited his home, asking him to repair landmines. The Russian profited greatly from this, and sometimes even concealed them. Later, after the Sino-Russian agreement, the Russian still had these landmines in his home, hoping to sell them to Red Russia again at a high price. Recently, a Chinese worker on the CER learned of this and secretly reported it to the Gendarmerie Brigade, leading to the uncovering of the case.</p>
<p>Confession of the Russian Offender: After the Russian was arrested and brought to the Gendarmerie Squadron, he confessed as follows: (This confession is factual. The Russian, Fulo Lauv, resides at No. 1, North Gate, Xuanwen Street, under the jurisdiction of the 4th Special Police Precinct of Xinmajiagou in Harbin. On the 16th of this month, the Gendarmerie discovered that I was storing landmines at my home. They immediately came to my home to inspect and found nine landmines in a small shed in my yard, and nine rounds of "bayinzi" rifle ammunition in my house. They came together with the patrol officer of the Lujiujie Police Station of the 4th Special Police Precinct. Besides taking away the contraband, all the property in my house was intact and there was no disturbance, etc. This confession is factual.)</p>
<p>Report to Brigade Headquarters: Zheng, the commander of the Harbin detachment of the 18th Squadron of the 5th Northeast Gendarmerie Brigade, considered the case to be of great importance. That same day (the 16th), at 10:50 PM, he dispatched gendarmes to escort the Russian offender and the landmines to the 5th Brigade Headquarters in Jilin for interrogation and reported the uncovering of the case as follows: (Based on the confidential investigation report of Liu Zhenwen, the investigator of the detachment, it was reported that the Russian, Fulo Lauv, residing at No. 1, North Gate, Xuanwen Street, under the jurisdiction of the 4th Special Police Precinct, was concealing landmines. Investigators Fan Zhonglin, Russian translator Wang Zhanhui, squad leaders Li Xiangru and Song Hui, and gendarmes Zheng Delu, Pan Deyin, Shang Molin, and Wang Shichao were immediately dispatched to the location, along with the patrol officer of the Lujiujie Police Station of the 4th Special District, to conduct a search. Nine landmines were found in a small shed in the Russian's house, and nine rounds of "bayinzi" rifle ammunition were found in the house. The Russian was taken into custody for interrogation, and he confessed without denial. It is clear that the Russian's concealment of explosives and his reactionary activities, at a time when the Sino-Russian conference has not yet concluded, indicates a dangerous motive. If he is not handed over for punishment, how can we eliminate the Russian threat? It is appropriate to submit the Russian, Fulo Lauv, along with the nine landmines, nine rounds of "bayinzi" rifle ammunition, and a written confession, for further investigation. (April 16th)</p>

<p>Suppressing Bandits by Military Police in Yanjiang: Bandits were rampant in the four villages near Yanjiang. Local people requested the county government to handle the situation. Subsequently, local communities in the area organized a joint defense office of the Kuomintang, military, government, and police from Songjiang and Qingpu counties to actively suppress bandits. The establishment was approved by the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, with Company Commander Cai Ziliang stationed in the town as the director. In recent days, the garrison, led by the defense corps, searched and suppressed bandits in the four villages, detaining over sixty bandits and rescuing three kidnap victims. On the afternoon of the 26th, Lang Longgen, Wu Along, Cao Shousheng, Wu Jinsheng, Wang Laohu, Wu Shunyuan, Wu Chenshi, Xu Longyu, and Shen Jialong, nine individuals with clear criminal records, were executed on the spot, to the satisfaction of the people. That evening, four more individuals were captured and were being interrogated separately from other bandits for legal proceedings. Additionally, several bandits, who challenged the military police during the encirclement, were shot dead on the spot. The area is currently being searched to ensure complete suppression.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Bandit Traces Again in Zhangpu Township: Since Zhangpu Town was looted by lake bandits, the residents have been living in constant fear. On the 26th, eleven bandit boats with over a hundred lake bandits appeared on the Hua Xiang River, about two miles from the town. Residents reported this to the Public Security Bureau and the Seventh District Office, which took strict precautions. Fortunately, the bandits did not land to loot. It was said that they were there to avoid trouble. At midnight, they moved elsewhere. However, those in the town with some assets have moved to the city to avoid the danger.</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Opera Performances in Four Villages: Yesterday and the day before, residents of Shi Jiajing, Jiangli, Xinmiao, and Laomiao in Zhangpu Township invited the Jin Ji Rong opera troupe to perform spring opera. District Chief Luo Xingwei, upon learning of this, and considering the unrest in the current situation, urgently summoned the village chiefs and deputy chiefs of the surrounding villages, as well as the performers, for a discussion. As a result, the performers' losses were compensated, and the performers left for other locations. County Magistrate Pang Shusen, upon learning of this, issued a notice strictly prohibiting opera performances in various townships.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Kidnapping Case in Dongzhu Town: On the night before last (the 26th), around 9 PM, fifty or so lake bandits, all armed with Mauser pistols, arrived at Dongzhu Town, Guangfu Township, in the county. They robbed the Ren Chang provisions store, among other businesses. Before leaving, they kidnapped Guo Ziren, the owner of the Ren Chang provisions store. After the bandits left, the Guangfu branch bureau chief immediately reported to the county government, which ordered the third platoon of the first squadron of the county police to go to the countryside that night to pursue the bandits.</p>
<p>County Bureau Chief Severely Punishes Extortionist Officers: After a case of water patrol officers from the County Public Security Bureau extorting soil vendors came to light, County Bureau Chief Cao, on the afternoon of the 26th, sent a letter to District Chief Min of the Qing District to summon Wang Waitou, a soil vendor, for questioning. According to Wang, he was indeed extorted out of 500 yuan in cash and 500 yuan in promissory notes by Yu Jinzhou, Chen Shouzhang, and others from the water patrol team. At the time of the extortion, Yu and others had taken Wang Waitou, his brother Yonglan, the shop owner Tianying, and two others to the water patrol station to extort them. After hearing the confession, Bureau Chief Cao, in addition to returning Wang Waitou to the Qing District Office, ordered severe punishment for Yu and Chen, who committed the extortion.</p>
<p>Continued Report on the Fire Truck Killing Case: Regarding the case of Shen Delin driving a car for the Tongshan Fire Brigade in the South Hao area of the Eighth Section of the Xu Pan District and running over Shi Peiquan, the owner of the Shishunxing Copperware Store in Hulong Street, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 25th) around 6 PM, after the local court dispatched Prosecutor Lu Yihou to conduct an inspection, it was originally intended to prepare the body for burial on the same day. However, Shi's wife, Zhang, felt that her husband, Shi Peiquan, had been tragically crushed to death by a car, leaving behind a son and a daughter, and that she was currently pregnant, with no one to rely on in the future, which was quite worrying. Therefore, the coffin was not prepared that night, and her relatives all insisted on serious negotiations. Therefore, the aftermath could not be resolved for the time being. As for the fire brigade, it was scheduled to hold a meeting yesterday (the 27th) to discuss methods to compensate Shi's wife, Zhang, and to discipline the members.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Damage to Machinery of the Xihu Steamer: The Taihu Steamer has been operating regularly between Wuxi and Huzhou, providing convenient transportation. Yesterday (the 26th), the Wuxi Bureau sold tickets and sent passengers as usual. When the small steamer arrived at Daxikou, it received information from Huzhou that the machinery on the steamer was damaged and could not operate. The small steamer immediately turned back, and the passengers rushed to refund their tickets. It is estimated that operations will resume as usual today. A Bandit Caught Tearing Up a Ticket: Qian Fenghao, the assistant manager of the Dingchang Silk Factory outside the South Gate of Wuxi, had his two-year-old beloved daughter, Aba, kidnapped by bandits from his home in Nanrang Village, Xinan Township, on the night of the 2nd of this month at 11 PM, and his clothing was also looted, resulting in a loss of several hundred yuan. Subsequently, Mr. Qian repeatedly received letters from the bandits demanding ransom, initially demanding 5,000 yuan, and later reducing it to several hundred yuan. Mr. Qian negotiated with the contact person under false pretenses. Unexpectedly, recently, the body of Qian Aba was discovered in the reeds near the village, indicating that the bandits had torn up the ticket. Mr. and Mrs. Qian were extremely saddened after hearing the news. Yesterday, it was learned that Ni Gusheng, the captain of the second detective team of the Provincial Public Security Water Police in Wuxi, had arrested a suspect named Zhou, the leader of the gang, at the Yong'an Hotel in Shanghai. He is scheduled to be escorted to Wuxi within days to face legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Provincial Order to Arrest Wang Zuxie Unsuccessful: Wang Zuxie, a native of Wujin, is in his twenties. He previously studied at the Provincial Xizhong School in this county, serving as the secretary of the student union and a member of the local student union and the anti-Japanese sports association. Last year, Wang also served as a member of the executive committee and the labor committee of the county party headquarters in his hometown of Wujin. Recently, he had no known occupation. The day before yesterday, the county government suddenly received a secret order from the provincial government, ordering the immediate arrest of Wang Zuxie for investigation. County Magistrate Sun immediately ordered Zhu Zhengdong, the police captain, to dispatch a team to secretly arrest him. After receiving the order, Captain Zhu learned that Wang Zuxie was hiding at the home of his wife's parents in Dingzhuang, Fuan Township. He then ordered Zhu Jinru and others, the leaders of the water patrol team stationed in the township, to arrest him at the address. As a result, because they did not recognize each other, Wang Zuxie was able to escape. His wife's younger brothers, Yang Huanjin and Yang Huanxue, were taken to the city for investigation. It is rumored that the reason for the arrest was suspicion of counter-revolutionary activities.</p>
<p>Bandit Revenge Night Raid on Yuantong Nunnery: In Dalishi, Wuyi Ward, Tianshang Township, there is a Yuantong Nunnery. In November of last year, it was robbed by bandits, resulting in significant losses. Afterwards, the elderly nun Li Rongxian reported the matter to the county for investigation. Subsequently, two well-known bandits, Cao Hequan and You Shengchuang, were apprehended and brought to the county for questioning. The two confessed without hesitation. The county government then summoned the elderly nun Li Rongxian to the case for questioning. However, the bandits learned of this and suspected that she had identified them, harboring deep resentment. On the night of the day before yesterday (the 25th), they gathered a crowd of over ten people, each carrying sickles, mulberry knives, flashlights, and other items, and went to the nunnery for revenge. They broke down the door and entered, first tying up the worker Zhu Jinrong with ropes, then dragging the elderly nun Li Rongxian and the young nun Qiaolin from their beds, tying them up with ropes, hanging them up, and beating them severely. They also burned the elderly nun's buttocks and the young nun's neck with lit candles, causing terrible injuries. The bandits then rummaged through boxes and cabinets and looted extensively. They stole two yuan in silver dollars, six jiao in small silver coins, three thousand copper coins, and three umbrellas. After obtaining the loot, the bandits left with shouts. It is reported that the nuns suffered serious injuries and were unable to move. They are scheduled to come to the city today to report to the county for examination of their injuries.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Representatives from All Sectors Go to Haimen to Request Troops: The Second Battalion of the 27th Regiment of the Fifth Division of Songhu was suppressing bandits in the eastern townships of Nantong. Recently, they received orders to relocate to Haimen, and the bandit atmosphere resurged. The Fifth of May Memorial Day is approaching, and there are rumors of a major riot by the communists in the city and suburbs. On the 26th, County Magistrate Zhang and representatives from party and government agencies went to Haimen to liaise with Battalion Commander Hu Xiangzao and members of the general headquarters, requesting that the troops be returned to Nantong to secure the area.</p>
<p>Change of Head of Land Tax Collection: Liu Shuzi, the head of land tax collection in Nantong County, passed away due to illness. On the 26th, the Finance Bureau appointed Liu Mengzhou to take over the position.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the City and Township Business Corps into a Defense Corps: The City and Township Business Corps affiliated with the Nantong-Chongming-Haitai General Chamber of Commerce is currently being taken over by the First District Office. A defense corps is being reorganized, raising 20,000 yuan to purchase weapons and expand its strength.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>The Provincial Party Committee Requests the Removal and Punishment of Liu Pingjiang: The Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, because Liu Pingjiang, the Director of the Education Bureau of the Capital Special Municipality, had, when Sun Chuanfang was in Suzhou, slandered the Three Principles of the People and vilified the Party at the welcoming rally for Sun Chuanfang in Haizhou, falsely accusing the Party of unifying the country, and then opportunistically surrendered and held important positions. Previously, while serving as the County Magistrate of Yixing County, he was repeatedly accused by the county party headquarters and local people of dereliction of duty, perversion of justice, and harsh and violent levies, which was confirmed by review. It was presented to the central government to be forwarded to the National Government for investigation and strict handling. He then took the opportunity to resign. Recently, he was promoted to Director of the Education Bureau of the Capital Special Municipality, which is contrary to the central government's intention to rectify officials. Therefore, yesterday, it was specifically resolved to request the central government to forward the matter to the National Government for removal and punishment, and a letter was sent to the Nanjing Special Municipality Party Department, unanimously advocating for this.</p>
<p>Former Chairman of the Anti-Japanese Association Xue to Be Severely Punished: The Zhenjiang County Supervisory Committee, in connection with the accounts of the former Chairman of the Anti-Japanese Association, Xue Zhenglin, found that he had embezzled more than 500 yuan of public funds and lacked supporting documents for expenditures totaling more than 2,000 yuan. Various forms of excessive spending constituted a breach of duty. The matter was referred to the Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee for a review of the accounts. The investigation confirmed the above facts. In addition to requesting severe punishment, the entire case has been transferred to the court for review.</p>
<p>Nanjing</p>
<p>A Record of Feng Luoxizhen's Tragic Death: After 10 PM on the evening of the 23rd of this month, a tragic event occurred in Nanjing. Feng Luoxizhen, an employee of the Central Party Headquarters, drowned. Madam Luo was the wife of Feng Youzhen, a reporter for the Central News Agency, and was 25 years old. Originally from Sichuan, she had been married to Mr. Feng for three years and had two daughters, the elder being only two weeks old and the younger only eight months old. She was also three months pregnant. Madam Luo graduated from the Central Political Staff Training Institute and served as a staff member in the Nanjing Special Municipality Party Headquarters in the sixteenth year of the Republic. Last year, she became an assistant staff member in the Mass Training Department of the Training Department of the Central Party Headquarters. She currently resided at No. 3 Majia Street, behind the Central Printing Office. The family employed a reliable rickshaw puller and two trustworthy maids. Mr. Feng had long intended to move due to the secluded location of their residence. He had already rented a new house at No. 20 Baiziting, inside Xuanwu Gate, which would be completed and moved into within days. However, because there was too little furniture, he intended to purchase more. A guest staying at a friend's house was about to move to Shanghai and was willing to sell a lot of his remaining wooden furniture at a low price. Mr. and Mrs. Feng had long wanted to go and buy it. On the day before yesterday (the 23rd), one day after the closing of the National Boy Scout Grand Review, Mrs. Feng intended to go to Shibanqiao in the afternoon to inspect the wooden furniture in order to purchase it. When Mrs. Feng went out at 2 PM, because her second daughter suffered from an eye disease, she instructed the maid to take her to the health department of the Central Party Headquarters for treatment. After the treatment, she instructed the maid to take her back, and she hired a rickshaw to Shibanqiao to visit a friend. At 8 PM, Mrs. Feng wanted to return home, but because her friend insisted on her staying, it was not until after 10 PM that her friend hired a rickshaw for her and paid the fare to send her back to her residence. According to her friend, when Mrs. Feng got into the rickshaw, she was heard telling the rickshaw puller to take her to Majia Street, behind the Central Party Headquarters. Mr. Feng saw that his wife had not returned late at night and initially assumed that it was because of the heavy rain or because her friend had kept her for the night. He waited calmly until dawn and then called her friend to inquire. At this point, both sides were extremely alarmed. Mr. Feng immediately prepared a car and went to various places to inquire and also reported to the Tenth Police Station in charge of his residence. The station chief, Pan Baijian, upon receiving the report, immediately sent people to investigate in all directions and also reported to the police department, ordering all stations to investigate together. However, there was no news for several days and no clues. Today (the 26th) at 2 PM, Mr. Feng intended to go to the First Police Station in Daxing Palace to discuss the investigation. He hired a car in front of the Central Party Headquarters and, while driving to the pond on the east side of the Central Party Headquarters, Mr. Feng saw many people standing by the pond watching. Knowing that something was wrong, Mr. Feng immediately got out of the car and saw a tuft of black hair in the pond. At this point, Mr. Feng was quite suspicious and spent two silver dollars to ask someone to dredge. When the body was out of the water, it was indeed his wife. Mr. Feng cried bitterly and almost fainted. At 4 PM, the local court sent a prosecutor to conduct an inspection. Because Mr. Feng did not want to expose his wife's body, only her head and hands were inspected. It was found that there were no injuries. Mr. Feng immediately prepared the body for burial that night and temporarily placed it in a temporary location. As for the cause of Mrs. Feng's death, one possibility is that she was murdered. The night was stormy, and the world was dark, which was a good opportunity for murder, and the rickshaw puller was missing, which was particularly suspicious. According to the Ninth Police Station, when the station checked rickshaw number 4581 with the public works bureau, the bureau said that the number had not been registered this season and that a person named Ding had come to the bureau today to inquire about the matter. Therefore, the clues in this case are worth noting. Also, the soldiers of the constitutional police training team stationed in the house built by Tang Shengzhi in Gaoloumen said that they had heard calls for help four times that night. When the soldiers chased out, they saw six or seven people running wildly, but they were unable to catch up. Therefore, there is no doubt about the murder. However, the reason for the murder, whether for money or for other political purposes, will only be clarified after the rickshaw puller is interrogated.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Seven Murderous Robbers Sentenced to Death: According to the police team, Chen Bixian, Li Hongcai, Wu Hengxing, Wang Guisheng, Dai Younian, Lu Er, and Meng Zhaochun, seven robbers who had successively looted the home of Jiang Senhe in Jiangjiaqiao, Yiling, on March 12, injuring four members of the household, and looted the home of Zhu Fale in Huoqiao, killing three members of the household, on March 21, and looted the home of Qian Wufeng outside Guangchou Gate, confessed to robbing and murdering, and sharing the loot without denial. The case was submitted to the provincial government,</p>
<p>which approved the death sentence for the convicts, and they were taken to the execution ground on the afternoon of the 26th at 4 PM and executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Memorial Committee for Xiong Garden: At 3 PM on the 26th, Wang Boling, a member of the provincial government, sent a letter inviting the members of the preparatory committee for the construction of the Xiong Memorial Garden to hold an establishment meeting in the Xiaohuayuan south of the city. Chairman Wang Boling reported the purpose of the meeting: (1) The amount of funds raised has reached 28,700 yuan; (2) Stated the reasons why Xiong's grave could not be moved; (3) Surveyed several sites, with Taohuawu near Bijia Mountain being the most suitable. Then, the regulations were discussed, revised, and then the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Searching for Opium Mistaken for Bandit Robbery: Around 9 PM on the evening of the 25th, six people in black uniforms and plainclothes came to the home of Li Baichuan in Tianjiacang, claiming that they were ordered to search for opium based on a report from a Mr. Tang. They immediately closed the gate tightly. Neighbors thought it was a bandit robbery and telegraphed the Chamber of Commerce, which informed the Commerce Corps, police station, and the county detective team. They arrived one after another, filling the vicinity and the city walls, waiting to pursue and arrest. Unexpectedly, the searchers, seeing that there was no evidence of opium, seized the opportunity to escape. Upon inspection, only 15 yuan in silver was missing from the bedside.</p>
<p>Qingjiang</p>
<p>Lianshui Detects a Major Bandit: Zheng Kejun from Anhui Province resided in Huai'an City. The Lianshui Public Security Bureau learned that Zheng was a major bandit from Anhui Province who had been hiding in Huai'an and colluding with reactionaries, plotting wrongdoings. On the 18th, the county's box gun team, with many members, went to Huai'an and arrested Zheng, presenting him to the Lianshui County Government. After interrogation by County Magistrate Chen, Zheng confessed to having received the title of fake commander-in-chief and admitted to colluding with reactionaries.</p>
<p>Jiashan</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Refugees Harassing Various Towns: The County Public Security Bureau, on the 25th, received reports from residents of Hongxi and Jiangjing that over 400 refugees from Xiangxiang were harassing the area and looting. The bureau telegraphed the Seventh Water Police Team in Qianyao to dispatch a team to suppress them. Unexpectedly, the refugees looted the family of the local gentry, Xue Zhe, and the Xue family provided a list of losses to the county to be pursued and investigated. On the 26th, the Tianrenzhuang branch bureau reported that several hundred refugees had occupied civilian houses and were very rampant, requesting the dispatch of a team to suppress them. Yangmiao Town also telegraphed that over 200 refugees were forcibly buying goods and looting clothing and other items. Therefore, Director Gu personally led eight long-serving police officers to rush to the towns to suppress them separately.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Kidnapping Case in Hantang District: Shi Lansheng, a guest resident in Hantang District, Jiaxing, outside the Muqiao, has some wealth and has long been coveted by bandits. In February of this year, he was kidnapped by bandits, but he escaped halfway and returned safely. Unexpectedly, many thugs suddenly came again at dusk the day before yesterday, swarming into his house. Shi Lansheng's son was unable to escape and was kidnapped. When the local water police heard the news and pursued them, the bandits had disappeared.</p>
<p>Change of Director of the County Treasury: The Director of the Jiaxing County Treasury was concurrently held by Xu Hesheng, the Director of Operations of the China Bank in Jiaxing. Director Xu has now been transferred to Shaoxing by the head office, and Gao Zuyin has been appointed to serve as the Director of the China Bank in Jiaxing. Therefore, the Director of the County Treasury has also been changed at the same time and is still concurrently held by Gao Zuyin.</p>
<p>Recent Investigation into Silkworm Rearing in the Four Villages: Silkworm rearing in the four villages of Jiaxing is widespread. The early rearing season has already passed, and the late rearing season is also over the initial stages. However, due to the sudden cold and warm weather, the silkworms are not developing very evenly. Fortunately, they are still in their early stages, and if the rearers pay attention to care, there should be no damage. Investigations show that there are more silkworms being reared this year than in previous years because the villagers all hope for good silkworm rearing to make up for the poor autumn harvest last year.</p>
<p>Huzhou</p>
<p>Two Bandits Rob a Fast Boat: The Wu-Chang fast boat belonging to Huzhou was traveling from Changxing to Huzhou this morning. At about 10 AM, when passing the shore between Lushan and Yinchun Bridge, two bandits suddenly appeared, one with a handgun and the other unarmed, shouting for the boat to stop. After the two bandits got on board, they searched the passengers one by one. However, two passengers from Henan were not searched because they greeted the bandits when they got on board. Also, a Mr. Tao from Changxing was sitting with the passenger, and the bandits mistakenly thought they were from the same village. Except for these three people, over ten passengers were spared, with losses estimated at over one hundred yuan. While the bandits were searching, a steamship from Huzhou passing by headed toward Changxing. The bandits got off the boat and fled. Therefore, clothes and goods were not looted. Afterward, the fast boat returned to Changxing, and six passengers from Yinchun Bridge</p>
<p>walked to Baziqiao to hire a boat to Huzhou.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Zhuji Bandits Defeated, Will Flee to Fuyang: The Zhejiang Provincial Government received a report from Xu Zhigui, the County Magistrate of Zhuji, stating that over 400 bandits were discovered in the Sandu area, seizing weapons and looting. They have now been defeated by Chen Battalion of the Sixth Security Regiment. However, it is feared that they will flee to Fuyang and other places. Therefore, yesterday, another telegram ordered the Third Regiment stationed in Pinghu to dispatch a team to station and suppress them.</p>
<p>The Liangzhe Salt Fields Scheduled for Reorganization: The Liangzhe Salt Transport Office, in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the ministry, issued a notice yesterday to all affiliated salt fields, stating that they will be reorganized on May 1, and the allocation of funds will be handled according to the original budget.</p>
<p>Financial Circles Negotiate Large Loans: Hangzhou's financial circles, with April being the period of financial contraction and expansion, must grant long-term loans as usual. Recently, the loans that have been negotiated are in excess of 1.3 million yuan, with 20% for tea, 20% for silk, 20% for the cloth industry, 30% for old silk merchants, and the rest for the rice industry and other industries.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Continued Report on the Accident Involving a Bus on the Xiaoshan-Shaoxing Highway: Regarding the accident on the Xiaoshan-Shaoxing provincial highway bus, which occurred on the morning of the 24th while traveling from Jiangbian to Shaoxing near the Xixing station when the car wheel suddenly broke, investigations have revealed that one passenger, Mrs. Mo, 52 years old, died from severe injuries. Three other passengers, Guo Fajian, Zhang Xiaomao, and Xu Jianhao, suffered severe head injuries and are currently being treated at the Jimin Hospital in Dongmen. Five other people, Chen Xishen, Chen Baohong, Ye Kuixian, Hong Furong, and Jin Yunsheng, suffered minor injuries and were sent home after Wang Jianming performed minor surgery. Wu, the director of the road transport management office, considered the matter important and sent Wang Zongshan as a representative to Xiaoshan to investigate the truth of the accident and to discuss compensation for medical expenses. It is also reported that the driver of the bus has fled. Finance Bureau Staff Released on Bail: Miao Baoshan, former section chief of the Xiaoshan Finance Bureau, and Yu Huixian, a staff member, were previously detained and sent to the province for supervision in connection with the bureau chief's corruption case. It is now reported that Mr. Miao and Mr. Yu were not significantly involved in the case and were released on bail from the province on the 24th. However, Shen Changyi, the director of the Finance Bureau, is still being detained by the Hangzhou Local Court.</p>
<p>Fuyang</p>
<p>Tragic Murder Case in Two Villages in Fuyang: Rang Village and Shangsha Village in Jingshan Township, Fuyang County, are adjacent villages where people live together by clans. Each village has several hundred households, all engaged in agriculture. Therefore, the people of the two villages are either relatives or friends and have always lived in peace. Unexpectedly, during the North-South War, countless Northern soldiers' firearms were left in the hands of the people. Having obtained these firearms, the residents gradually developed the trend of annexing other clans. On the 11th of this month, Cao Ayu, a resident of Rang Village, was leading an ox to graze in the fields of the people of Shangsha Village, eating wheat. Jin Rumao, a resident of Shangsha Village, saw this and immediately went home to get a gun and rushed to the field, shooting Cao Ayu and the</p>
<p>ox to death. When the people of Rang Village heard about this, they immediately sounded the gong and gathered a crowd to kidnap seven residents of Shangsha Village who were walking on the road, including Jin Shoukun and Zhang Laigen. They were immediately hacked to death with knives by Cao Bingzhang, Cao Amin, and others from Rang Village and buried to eliminate evidence. The other five people were fortunately rescued by a Mr. Xu from a neighboring village who learned of the situation. Currently, in addition to both parties filing lawsuits with the authorities, the people of both villages are hiding in their homes, secretly plotting revenge and daring not to work in the fields, fearing that they will be kidnapped by the other party and their lives will not be guaranteed. It is now the time for planting crops. If this matter is not resolved for one day, they will not be able to work. If the planting period is delayed, the autumn harvest will definitely be hopeless. Then, the hundreds of farmers who are starving and unable to eat will inevitably take risks and become bandits. The consequences are unimaginable. I wonder what method those in charge of the area will use to mediate this situation.</p>

<h3>Opinions</h3>
<p>Reflections on the National Education Conference Discussions by Wang Maozu</p>
<p>The Second National Education Conference has concluded on the 23rd. Expert member Mr. Wang Maozu has written an article expressing his thoughts on the discussions. We are now publishing it below. Editor's Note. A. Compulsory Education</p>
<p>The school age for compulsory education should not be explained in a footnote. It should be marked as a separate section, clearly defining the national school age. The national school age period should not only be slightly wider, possibly from six to fifteen years old, each locality should further deliberate based on the national timeframe, and determine the local school age. There should be no discrepancies in school enrollment for children of the same locality and age reaching the local school age. The plan should stipulate that each academic year should have at least a certain number of classes or weeks of instruction. If any locality has special circumstances, and the annual instruction period cannot meet the stipulated number of days, the duration of the year must be extended.</p>
<p>B. Teacher Training</p>
<p>(1) It is feared that the recruitment of junior high school graduates for rural normal schools, with the period of study revised to three years, and elementary school graduates extended to six years, will be difficult to implement. Firstly, most junior high schools are established in urban areas, and graduates, even if willing to become teachers, are often unwilling to go to rural areas, especially if the length of their studies is further increased. Secondly, a certain province started a rural normal school, recruiting junior high school graduates, training them for two years, but few junior high school graduates applied. They had no choice but to recruit many with equivalent qualifications. Thirdly, the rural normal school in Jiangsu Province admits elementary school graduates aged fifteen and above, trains them for two years (later increased by one year). After graduation, the demand for their services is great, but the supply is insufficient. Now, with the promotion of compulsory education, while at the same time extending the teacher training period, the shortage of teachers is even more acute. Elementary schools requiring six years is similarly difficult.</p>
<p>(2) In theory, the qualifications of rural and urban teachers should not differ, but when the quantity and quality cannot be reconciled during the promotion of compulsory education, it is best to prioritize quantity. I believe it is best to shorten the duration and produce a large number of teachers, and gradually seek qualitative improvement. Otherwise, compulsory education may not be completed as scheduled. (3) The issue of board and lodging for normal school students was not discussed much this time, which is a great pity. Looking at history and reality, this system cannot be completely abolished. In my opinion, it is best to adopt a graded reward system based on the overall academic performance, conduct, and physical education, and provide subsidies. The total amount of subsidies should not be less than the total amount of board and lodging fees to be issued.</p>
<p>(4) The issue of normal school independence. Several years ago, when the merger of normal schools was discussed, I argued that normal schools should be absolutely independent. I had compiled several essays on normal school independence and authored one myself ("Five Major Issues in Normal School Education"), published them together in a booklet and distributed them. I also proposed a resolution on "Normal School Independence" at the annual meeting of the Educational Improvement Society. When the merger of normal schools in Jiangsu Province was proposed, I still stood up and argued against it. However, in this conference, the argument was made that (middle) schools and (normal) schools could be co-established. This is indeed due to the fact that in economically backward and educationally underdeveloped areas, it is extremely difficult to add a school. Therefore, I advocate that secondary schools can co-establish normal school departments, and normal schools can also co-establish general departments. As for secondary and normal schools that have not merged, it is not necessary to merge them; those that have already merged need not be instructed to gradually become independent. This is because I fear that certain groups may take this opportunity to launch a petition to restore schools, which will be a burden on the academic atmosphere. Furthermore, I believe that there are too few normal universities now. The government should delineate regions and gradually establish them. Each province should also establish large-scale central normal schools, at least one and at most four.</p>
<p>(5) After graduation, normal school students often do not want to serve in elementary schools if they have other opportunities, especially those with strong abilities. This is extremely sad and dangerous. The plan stipulates that tuition fees must be recovered, but recovering fees cannot fundamentally solve the problem. The only way to solve the problem is to increase salaries and implement seniority-based pay increases, with the same treatment for rural and urban areas.</p>
<p>C. Secondary Education</p>
<p>(1) I strongly agree with raising the level of general high schools and consolidating their management. However, if we want to imitate the French Lycée and the Japanese higher schools for senior high schools, the prerequisite is to increase the junior high school years. I have already published an essay on the "Four-Three System for Secondary Schools".</p>
<p>(2) The issue of separate or combined departments in senior high schools. My opinion on the original proposal for the Second National Education Conference is a review (4).</p>
<h3>IV. Plan for Establishing Teacher Training Institutions of All Levels and Types</h3>
<p>(1) Timeframe</p>
<p>Complete the establishment of national teacher training institutions within five years.</p>
<p>(2) Level and Duration of Teacher Training Institutions at All Levels</p>
<p>(1) Rural Normal Schools Recruit: (1) Junior high school graduates for three years of training; (2) Elementary school graduates aged fifteen or older for six years of training; (3) Rural elementary school teachers with junior high school equivalent level for three years of training. In special circumstances or local needs, they may be sent to rural elementary schools to serve after completing half of the original duration, and then receive supplementary training in stages.</p>
<p>(2) Normal Schools and Senior High Normal Departments recruit junior high school graduates for three years of training. These schools may have attached kindergarten normal departments with the same level.</p>
<p>(3) Rural Normal Teacher Training at University Education Colleges and Normal Universities should have specially established departments or specialized courses, or establish Rural Normal Colleges for training. There should be at least one such institution in each province.</p>
<p>(4) Rural Normal Specialized Courses recruit high school, senior high normal department, normal school, or rural normal graduates for two years of training. They are assigned to serve as teachers or assistant teachers in central elementary schools. After completing three summer semesters of further study, they are granted graduation certificates and are qualified to be rural normal school teachers.</p>
<p>(5) Normal Specialized Courses recruit high school graduates and provide them with two years or training similar to the previous clause. After graduation, they are qualified to be junior high school teachers.</p>
<p>(6) Rural Normal Colleges recruit university or normal university students who have completed two years of study, or graduates of normal specialized courses or rural normal specialized courses, who are sent to serve in rural normal schools for two years after one year of study, and then study for another year to be awarded a bachelor's degree and are qualified to be teachers of rural normal specialized courses.</p>
<p>(7) Normal Universities, University Education Colleges, and other university departments related to teacher training all recruit high school graduates, provide them with four years or training similar to the previous clause, award a bachelor's degree, and qualify them to be secondary school teachers.</p>
<p>(8) Teacher training institutions at all levels may have divisions and departments for special needs, with a duration of one to three years.</p>
<p>(3) Methods for Establishing Teacher Training Institutions (1) Rural normal schools should be established in each county in principle. Poor counties may jointly establish one school for two counties (special municipalities may establish a number of schools as needed). It is tentatively set to establish a total of 1,500 schools nationwide. From the third to the fifth year of the Tutelage Period, 500 schools will be established each year. The central government will provide appropriate subsidies for the expenses required.</p>
<p>(2) Senior high normal departments and normal schools should be established by the province in principle. Kindergarten normal departments should be attached to normal schools or senior high schools in principle.</p>
<p>(3) Rural normal colleges should be established in each province in principle. Rural normal specialized courses should be attached to rural normal colleges. The central government will subsidize the expenses required. If there is a shortage of teachers, the Ministry of Education may be requested to entrust other relevant institutions to train them.</p>
<p>(4) Normal universities and university education colleges should be national institutions in principle, with expenses paid from the national treasury. Normal specialized courses should be established in university education colleges or normal universities. Each province may also establish them independently. Expenses for independent institutions will be paid by the provincial treasury, and the central government may provide appropriate subsidies.</p>
<h3>IV. Curriculum of Teacher Training Institutions at All Levels</h3>
<p>(1) The curriculum standards for teacher training institutions above the specialized level will be drafted by the Curriculum Standards Drafting Committee of the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>(2) Curriculum standards for senior high normal departments and normal schools: (A) The draft prepared by the Primary and Secondary School Curriculum Standards Drafting Committee will be used temporarily, and the Ministry of Education will revise it after the trial period to serve as the formal standard. (B) Refer to the rural normal school curriculum measures and formulate standards based on the needs of elementary schools.</p>
<p>(3) The rural normal school curriculum standards will be drafted by the Primary and Secondary School Curriculum Standards Drafting Committee, based on the needs of elementary schools. After drafting the required courses, they can be increased or decreased with reference to the senior high normal department curriculum to facilitate further study.</p>
<p>(4) The curriculum standards for kindergarten normal departments and rural kindergarten normal departments will be drafted by the Primary and Secondary School Curriculum Standards Drafting Committee.</p>
<p>(5) The detailed curriculum for teacher training of all levels and types will be drafted by national universities and provincial departments of education based on the trial standards and submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval.</p>
<p>(6) The curriculum for special teacher training at all levels will be drafted by the Ministry of Education Organizing Committee and detailed curricula will be drafted by national universities or departments of education based on the standards and submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval.</p>
<p>(5) Internship Methods</p>
<p>(1) Internship should be divided into three steps: observation, apprenticeship, and teaching practice.</p>
<p>(2) Normal schools should have dedicated staff responsible for planning and guidance.</p>
<p>(3) Normal school students who fail the internship should not be allowed to graduate.</p>
<p>(4) There should be a central school as a training center.</p>
<p>(6) Service and Treatment</p>
<p>(1) The service period for graduates should be equal to the length of their training, but the compulsory period should be no more than five years.</p>
<p>(2) If unable to serve due to illness, it can be postponed with a doctor's certificate.</p>
<p>(3) Some or all of the tuition and accommodation fees may be waived.</p>
<p>(4) Students who withdraw midway or do not serve will have the waived tuition and accommodation fees recovered from their financial guarantor.</p>
<p>(7) Vocational Teacher Training Methods</p>
<p>(1) Normal universities and university education colleges may recruit graduates from university agriculture, industry, and commerce departments and provide them with one year of teacher training. After graduation, they may serve as teachers in senior high school vocational departments or vocational schools. Students from university agriculture, industry, and commerce colleges who are interested in vocational education should select at least sixteen credits of education courses from their third year onwards. The courses are to be specified by the university education college or education department.</p>
<p>(2) Normal specialized courses may recruit graduates of specialized schools and senior high school vocational department graduates with three or more years of field experience, and provide them with one year of teacher training to enable them to become teachers of vocational subjects at the junior high school level.</p>
<p>(3) Normal schools or senior high normal departments may recruit vocational school or senior high agriculture, industry, and commerce department graduates with relevant experience, and provide them with one year of teacher training to enable them to become teachers of vocational supplementary schools or classes at the elementary school level.</p>
<p>(4) The curriculum for vocational teacher training classes at all levels will be set by the Ministry of Education Organizing Committee, stipulating a timeframe for trial implementation. The detailed curriculum will then be revised based on the results of the trial implementation, and will be separately stipulated by the national universities and provincial education departments based on the standards and submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval.</p>
<p>(8) In-service Training Measures for Primary and Secondary School Faculty and Staff</p>
<p>(1) Open summer schools (A) Opened annually by national universities in each province. If two or more national universities are in the same location, or if a national university is located in the same location as a provincial or municipal education administrative agency, they may consult and jointly operate the summer school. (B) Each province and special municipality should operate one summer school annually. Tuition fees should not be charged, and the courses should be suitable for the needs. The location of the provincial summer school does not need to be the same each year. Cities and counties that do not operate summer schools should each send two people to attend the summer school.</p>
<p>(2) Order and issue in-service training books for primary and secondary school teachers (A) The Ministry of Education compiles and categorizes booklists. (B) The central and local governments jointly raise funds to purchase the minimum amount of books required for teachers to train themselves and distribute them to each school. (C) Each province, city, and county should raise sufficient funds and establish mobile libraries within a limited time.</p>
<p>(3) Promote reading groups. (A) The book list is selected by a specially appointed instructor or expert from the Department of Education. Teachers must report their reading experience at least once per semester. (B) The expenses of the reading group are borne by the city and county education administrative agencies and are subject to their supervision and guidance.</p>
<p>(4) Select outstanding teachers for further study (A) Each province conducts a selection test once a year and sends the selected teachers to relevant schools at home and abroad to study. (B) The number of people selected and the standards are to be stipulated by each Department of Education. (C) After completing their studies, they will return to the province or city that sent them to serve.</p>
<p>(5) Cities and counties operate holiday lecture series (A) One county or several counties jointly operate the series, with the expenses borne by the county. (B) The lecture materials should focus on practical problems, and the opinions of each member should be solicited.</p>
<p>(6) Clarify the methods for the Education Association to conduct academic research (A) Conduct group research, hold group meetings each semester, and have research reports and publications each year. (B) The expenses are shared by the members, and the publication and printing costs may be subsidized.</p>
<p>I very much agree with the idea of setting up vocational and non-vocational departments separately, and the rest to be combined. It is generally believed that general high schools should concentrate on the purpose of higher education, and vocational high schools should concentrate on production capacity. However, life skills must be emphasized in all levels of schools, not only general high schools, and separate departments would not only be economically unfeasible, but also make class consciousness too clear, which is not appropriate.</p>
<p>As for the standard for establishing county-run junior high schools, the original plan stipulated that counties with education funds above 30,000 yuan may establish a school (revised to 40,000). I still have doubts about this. Many counties are using compulsory education funds to run junior high schools. A county with 30,000 yuan in funds would spend 8,000 to establish a junior high school. How would primary schools be taught? The method of joint county management is the most appropriate.</p>
<p>D. Higher Education</p>
<p>(1) Within the establishment standards for junior high schools and senior high schools, it is stipulated that the provincial or county and city education funds must be above a certain amount before they can be established. There are also stipulations on the number of primary school or junior high school graduates. There are no such stipulations in the higher education plan, and it is heard that some provinces that have already established universities have not established senior high schools, and face difficulties in enrollment. At the same time, junior high school graduates in those provinces also have difficulty in pursuing higher education, and often go to Shanghai, where most of them enroll in unapproved private universities or their secondary school departments. It is heard that after a certain university was shut down, the students from a certain province suffered the hardship of being homeless, which is very pitiful.</p>
<p>(2) If the government wants to develop border provinces, improve culture, and promote undertakings, it should establish universities in border provinces with national funds and transfer students to other universities. This kind of policy should be strongly advocated. However, if universities are established with provincial funds, it seems necessary to have stipulated provincial and county funding standards, just like junior and senior high schools, so that the intention can be consistent. There are many other issues, such as secondary schools and vocational education, which will be discussed in detail in another article. (Drafted on April 24th at the Capital Central Hotel)</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education Director Takes Office</h3>
<p>After the change of mayor of Nanjing, most of the directors of the affiliated bureaus were replaced with new directors. Mr. Liu Pingjiang (Zi Xuzhou), the new director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, took office at the bureau at 10:00 AM on the 26th. In addition to holding a ceremony, the outgoing director, Gu Shusen, hosted a banquet for Liu Pingjiang at Xiaoyao You in the First Park at noon that day. All the bureau staff were also present at the grand banquet. In the evening, Liu Pingjiang hosted a return banquet for Gu Shusen and the staff of the Bureau of Education. Liu formerly served as the director of Jinan School and the Jiangsu Provincial Eleventh Middle School. He does not advocate changing the existing staff of the Bureau of Education, in order to utilize their expertise.</p>
<h3>New Contribution to Adult Education</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Province Compulsory Education Joint Office and the Jiangsu Provincial People's Education College and Labor-Peasant College, recognizing the difficulty of literacy for adult illiterates, planned to promote phonetic symbols in all counties of the province as a remedy. They had already requested Mr. Qin Fengxiang to guide the matter. It is now heard that the preliminary work is divided into two major parts. The first part is to apply various principles of linguistics, phonology, and phonetics, starting with the analysis of the phonemes of the dialects of each county, and formulating various symbols. The second part is to formulate a basic list of homophones based on semantics and the most needed character retrieval method, for the preparation of dialect character lists specially needed by illiterate adults in various places. Now, a dialect survey form has been prepared, which divides all Chinese characters into more than ninety categories of die-rhymes and more than forty categories of double-sounds, and selects representative Chinese characters for each category to prepare more than a hundred separate tables, temporarily using international phonetic symbols and separately formulating phonetic notation regulations for recording, and then organizing until completion. This basic work, although difficult and onerous, cannot be based on anything less than profound theories and precise methods. However, after it is completed, it can make everyone able to do it without knowing the difficulty. It is truly a great contribution to adult education and cultural promotion. Furthermore, Mr. Qin has been devoted to this for sixteen years of experience. Mr. Wu Zhihui once promoted him as the earliest phonologist in China. He is now guiding this work, and optimism is warranted. Recently, the Central Executive Committee resolved to promote the method of phonetic symbols, aimed at popularization, and the office etc. have already prepared in advance, which shows their enthusiasm for hard work and contribution.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Training Department Orders School Authorities</h3>
<p>The Training Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Committee instructs the moral education directors and Party doctrine teachers of the city's schools as follows: (For compliance with the order, it is recently reported that during the Central government's suppression of rebellion, the situation is tense, and reactionary elements everywhere are taking the opportunity to act, in order to disrupt the rear and take advantage of the chaos. The Shanghai Communist Party especially has an expanded plan, to create an unprecedented massacre. All reactionary elements are now acting in separate ways to create chaos. Their methods of action are to incite workers for their sacrifice, and to seduce youth as tools. In addition to the trade unions, which are being prevented by the Civil Training Committee, the Municipal Bureau of Education has also convened a meeting of principals to discuss this. As May is approaching, all reactionary elements will inevitably use the name to engage in activities. The Party doctrine teachers and moral education directors of each school should pay special attention, strengthen precautions, and strictly prohibit all reactionary speeches and gatherings, whether from elements within the school or from outsiders. If anything is found, it should be immediately reported to suppress the budding chaos. It is their duty to not be negligent) etc.</p>

<h3>Japanese Tokyo Track and Field Preliminaries</h3>
<h3>10,000 Meter Far East Record</h3>
<p>Keio's Kitamasamoto Seizo</p>
<p>33 minutes 32 seconds</p>
<p>Exceeds China's Zhao Dexin</p>
<p>By 2 minutes 4.5 seconds</p>
<p>Swimming pool, volleyball court, and basketball court all completed, all-day preliminaries to be held soon.</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) The Far Eastern Games of this year have been diligently prepared by the Japanese Sports Association for several months. All preparatory work is now gradually nearing completion. As for the facilities for the games, the welcome banners, negotiations, publicity, and program departments have also been completed. Except for the boxing arena, which will not be finished until early May, the large swimming pool, volleyball court, and basketball court have all been completed. The swimming pool built by Japan this time is located in the Outer Garden of Meiji Jingu, costing 250,000 yen. Construction began on the 20th of last month, working day and night. The pool is divided into two: a competition pool and a diving pool. The competition pool is 50 meters long, 25 meters wide, and 1 meter deep. The diving pool is 25 meters long, 18 meters wide, and 5 meters deep. The construction of the two pools is enormous and can truly be boasted about to the world. The theme song, slogans, and publicity methods for the Games have also been prepared. In terms of competition athletes, preparations are being made urgently. The Japanese track and field athletes were selected once last autumn, and another round of elimination will be held this year. The national preliminary rounds of Japan will be held soon, with selections divided into fifteen regions, including Taiwan, Kanto, San'in, Northern Kyushu, Kinki, Hokuriku, Shikoku, Tokai, Manchuria, Karafuto, and Southern Kyushu. The Tokyo preliminaries have already been held. The most notable event was the 10,000-meter final, with a time of 33 minutes and 32 seconds, achieved by Mr. Kitamasamoto of Keio University. This is not only a new Japanese record, but also a Far Eastern record, exceeding the fastest time of our country's Zhao Dexin by 2 minutes and 4 seconds. In swimming, Japan unfortunately failed in Shanghai. Before this session, the elite Japanese swimmers were prohibited from competing abroad. Therefore, Japan is quite confident in the swimming championship this time. The singles tennis players are Sato and Nunoi, and the doubles players are Yamagishi and Shimura, all of whom have excellent skills. Although Japan has never won the soccer championship, their training efforts are quite intense, and their performance has greatly improved compared to before. Japan's performance in volleyball and basketball has always been poor, so the athletes for this session were selected early and have been practicing against each other in Takamatsu City since March 20. The Far Eastern Games have been held eight times since the first session. Japan and the Philippines have won the most championships in various events. Our country's sports have also made rapid progress recently. Looking at the results of the last session, our country was equal to Japan, with only a slight difference, ranking second. This year, the athletes of the three countries will compete again. It is unknown to whom the championship will belong. The championship results of previous sessions are as follows:</p>
<p>(Track and Field) Philippines won 5 times, Japan won 3 times.</p>
<p>(Swimming) China won 1 time, Philippines won 4 times, Japan won 3 times.</p>
<p>(Baseball) Philippines won 5 times, Japan won 3 times.</p>
<p>(Tennis) China won 1 time, Japan won 5 times, Philippines won 2 times.</p>
<p>(Soccer) China won 7 times, Philippines won 1 time.</p>
<p>(Basketball) China won 1 time, Philippines won 7 times.</p>
<p>(Volleyball) China won 4 times, Philippines won 4 times.</p>

<h3>A Word of Wisdom Wu Shan</h3>
<p>The fastest thing is light. The speed of changing love is even more intense compared to light.</p>
<p>To prevent future generations from becoming dependent, it is best to let them seek their own livelihood and be independent early.</p>
<p>People who have nothing to do hope to have something to do. People who have something to do hope to improve their position. This kind of ascending and descending mentality is a common problem among people in modern society.</p>
<p>The smarter young men and women are, the more easily they are deceived by love.</p>
<p>It is better to exercise diligently than to rely on supplements to maintain health.</p>
<p>Those who are quick to swear oaths are the most unreliable in their love.</p>
<p>Not rejoicing in success, not worrying about failure. This is the secret to getting things done.</p>
<p>Diligent and thrifty people will never be without food. Lazy people will never be free from cold and hunger. To solve the current difficulties, there is no other way than diligence and thrift.</p>
<h3>A Precious Talk on Photography Zheng Yimei</h3>
<p>But Jun Duyu is an artist in Shanghai. He is good at painting beauties, and the charming spirit is abundant in his works. However, he has been recently exhausted by the film industry, and he really has no time to paint. Therefore, although I know he is good, I rarely get to see his paintings. Jun is also good at taking scenery and arranging several beauties as figures in his scenery. Whether frowning or smiling, suitable for joy or anger, the background is also integrated with painting principles. Therefore, his works are all extraordinary in their intention and the expressions are vivid. In particular, the photo of little sister Yaqiu is the most. Little sister is a natural beauty, and her beauty also fits the spirit of the times. That Russian was once shocked and desperately desired when he saw her flawless feet. Moreover, Jun used artistic skills to capture her true appearance, so every muscle and every appearance is even more wonderful, which goes without saying. I once saw Jun photograph moving and static objects. He covered a table with fine sand, a fist-sized stone, and a broken branch, and arranged them in positions. He took out bird specimens and added artificial elements. Some were spreading their wings as if about to fly, and some were perched, pecking at grains. When the photo was taken and shown, the lightness, heaviness, shades, and flavors were just like a national flower painting. I was speechless. Jun is fond of taking scenery, so he buys a lot of Western magazines and books specializing in photography. If there is a satisfactory picture, he cuts it out and glues it into a hard-covered album. People, scenery, animals, and still life are classified into different categories for easy viewing and appreciation at any time. Magazines and special books are regarded as dregs after being cut out and discarded without cherishing them. According to him, if not so, it is like fragrant orchids mixed among wormwood, making it difficult to recognize their national fragrance. Jun once saw ten huge albums of pictures glued and stored by a certain Westerner in the Lu Yi Master Auction House. The famous works were dazzling, and they were eventually bought by a certain Western artist for several hundred gold. Jun was ashamed of his lack of money and could not seize them for himself. He still regrets it when he mentions it now.</p>
<h3>A Peculiar Family Letter Bing Xin</h3>
<p>Bing Xin likes to associate with men of letters. Recently, Zhang Yongjiu, a former fellow student whom I had not seen for more than ten years, moved from Huaiyin to Shanghai. He not only gave me local products but also invited me to his new residence with tea and refreshments.</p>
<p>As soon as I sat down, an uninvited guest arrived. He was dressed in a Western suit and leather shoes and had an elegant demeanor. Yongjiu said, "Uncle, this is great. I was just worried about drinking alone without company." Yongjiu introduced us to each other. After a while, Yongjiu's wife, Ms. Chen Yunxun, came out and called him "cousin" and asked if her aunt had sent a letter recently. The guest smiled without saying a word. There were five people in total, including Yongjiu's thirteen-year-old daughter, who also sat at the end. The guest spoke in the Anhui dialect and was extremely forthright. Halfway through the meal, he asked if Yongjiu had sent his daughter to school. Yongjiu said that our country's education was not yet perfect. The guest said, "Then are you abandoning learning altogether? If girls don't learn, it will affect the family in a small way and the country in a big way." He kept drinking as he spoke, as if he couldn't help but feel emotional. Later, I heard that Yongjiu taught his daughter Chinese and Western languages himself, and he was finally pleased. When the meal was over, the guest left first. Bing Xin said, "Although the guest is young, he is also a man of heart." Yunxun smiled. Yongjiu was about to say something when his thirteen-year-old daughter interrupted and said, "If you see him again, Mother, be sure to ask about his family letter again." Yunxun's smile deepened. Bing Xin was curious and insisted on hearing the story, and a peculiar family letter was fully revealed by Yongjiu. It turned out that the guest valued female education because Yunxun's grandmother was the guest's aunt, and the guest's wife was also from Yunxun's clan, but the lineage was distant and could not be traced. When the wife was young, she lived in the same neighborhood as Yunxun and spent a lot of time together. After the girls got married, they went to different places and did not see each other for fourteen or thirteen years. Fortunately, Yongjiu and the guest both worked in Huaiyin. Yunxun repeatedly wrote letters to the wife and attached them to the guest's family newspaper, but never received a reply. One day, Yongjiu was sitting with the guest when a messenger in green arrived. The wife had sent a letter. The guest hurriedly put it in his arms without opening it. Yongjiu teased him and said, "You have been married for several years, do you still have romantic words?" The guest said no. Yunxun said that her aunt was from her clan and she was very concerned about her. She asked to open the letter herself and tell her that she was safe. They did not dare to seize and see his secrets. The guest said with emotion, "My wife lacks only talent. The so-called family letter is actually Qin Shi Huang's wordless monument." They were close relatives, so there was nothing to hide. He took out the letter from his arms, opened it, and showed it to Yongjiu and his wife. There were two red dots on it, indicating that her parents-in-law were healthy. There were two black circles in the middle, indicating that she needed twenty silver dollars. There was a large ink smudge and a small ink smudge below, indicating that she herself was well and that the baby was growing up healthily. The last two characters written were Mingzhen, which was her name. She has never written a single character in her life except for these two characters. The guest's name is Yuan Songqin, and he is twenty-six years old. His wife, Chen Mingzhen, is two years younger than Songqin and has an elegant demeanor, but she has nothing in her head. Bing Xin dares to tell this to her female compatriots.</p>
<h3>A Record of Miss Yang's Secret of the New Art Drama Society</h3>
<p>The New Art Drama Society was organized by Tao Zhongcheng, Cao Zusheng, Wang Yizhi, and other alumni of the Xinhua Art University. Recently, they were invited by the school to perform the drama "Miss Yang's Secret" at the third-anniversary celebration. The play was directed and written by the pro-American playwright Mr. Gu Jianchen. It has profound meaning and a tight plot, making it a rare work in recent times. Miss Yang is played by Ms. Lv Qionghua. Her figure is graceful and her tone is tragic. The section where she asks the police chief not to strictly handle the club and refuses the marriage proposal of the gentleman Zhou Jichang is quite able to express Miss Yang's identity and the purpose of organizing the Dahua Club. It is said that Ms. Lv is performing on stage for the first time, and she has achieved such success. Her future is immeasurable. The role of the young girl Tao Jingfang is played by Ms. Sun Shipu. Ms. Sun played the leading role in the Drama Association's performance of "Blood Flower" this summer. Her expression and tone have already achieved excellent results. Every move and every word fully expresses the arrogant and unyielding spirit of the noble daughter, which has won the praise of the audience. Cao Zusheng's Yang Zhengli has a kind of courageous spirit and straightforwardness, and he uses generous actions to express it very well. Wang Yizhi plays Fu Jintao, who is energetic and has a dignified demeanor. Other roles, such as Wen Rongquan's Zhou Jichang, Li Dengyun's Pan Caihong, Zhang Xiuying's Sister Juhua, and Gan Sushan's Meiyun, are all able to abide by the identities of the people in the play. It is said that the society has been established for less than half a year, and it has been able to perform a three-hour long play, which can be said to be very rare.</p>
<h3>Talking About the Art of Resuscitation Huang Yingdai</h3>
<p>In recent times, science and culture have been increasingly advanced. Everything in nature that the ancients could not manufacture can now be made by human power. I know that if the ancients were in this world and saw airplanes flying in the sky and submarines traveling in the sea, they would be very surprised and would almost think they were dreaming. Although even a three-foot child knows that people cannot be resurrected after death, recently, the German physiologist Professor PioflesjorLMMichaolowski has become famous for inventing the art of resuscitation. Mr. Mi is German and is the head of the Department of Physiology at the Central Asian University in Russia. He deeply believes that people can be resurrected after death by scientific methods. He has experimented with various animals and the results are quite satisfactory. Mr. Mi has been studying the art of resuscitation for more than ten years. He usually lives alone in the laboratory, studying with all his heart, hoping that the technique will succeed as soon as possible. Recently, he completely extracted the blood from the blood vessels of a monkey. After its breath and pulse were cut off, after a lapse of twenty-four hours, he injected artificial blood from the original blood vessels. Before long, the dead monkey was resurrected. The chest and abdomen gradually beat, and breathing also returned to normal. After two days and nights, the monkey was able to move freely and jump as if flying, with no difference from before the test. Mr. Mi was overjoyed by this test. He deeply believes that the same operation can be used to bring the dead back to life. He decided to use a living person for an experiment to prove whether the technique was successful. However, there was no living person who was willing to be Mr. Mi's experimental tool. Later, he asked the Soviet government for assistance. As a result, the government agreed to provide prisoners who had been sentenced to death for his experiments. After the news spread, all the physiologists in Europe paid attention. March 26 was the date of the experiment. All the procedures were prepared the night before. Unexpectedly, on the morning of March 26, Mr. Mi was assassinated in the laboratory of Central Asian University. The people of Germany and Russia were saddened by the news. Mr. Mi's death was a major loss to the scientific community. It was also heard that Mr. Mi's wife was suspected of assassination, but the truth has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Small Nail Goods Scarce, Prices Rise Four to Five Candareens</h3>

<h3>Travelogue of the Southern Seas</h3>
<p>The third day [of the new year] was the fourth day of the second lunar month, the Malay people's New Year festival. The people decorated [their vehicles], and their whole families rode in "wind cars" (automobiles are called "wind cars" here) in processions. In the evening, thin boards were erected in the willow groves as dance floors, and men and women danced and sang. I went to observe. There were Westerners, Chinese, Malays, and Jilining people (a type of Indian, extremely dark-skinned). Yellow, white, and black races, old and young, men and women, it was indeed worthy of being called a natural human race museum exhibit. Outside the sheds, electric lights shone brightly. Inside the sheds, there was a Malay music concert with small drums, three-stringed instruments, lutes, violins, and other instruments. The melodies were quite pleasant to listen to. I felt that it was more refined than the loud gongs and drums used in Chinese gatherings. My friend, the great playwright Ouyang Yuqian, whose philosophy is profound, hates the gongs and drums in plays the most, saying that they are the first things that cannot exist in the theatrical revolution. I also deeply detest their noise. Their existence is only for attracting the attention of children because there are many lower-class admirers everywhere and few refined people, so they can only disturb their ears with this. However, I think that the inferiority of loud gongs and drums is still not as good as the quiet and elegant Malay music. I wonder if Mr. Ouyang thinks so. As for their dance style, it is still different from the Western dance style where men and women embrace and dance. Two or three pairs of men and women form a row and dance facing each other. Their bodies and hands do not touch. There are also various postures. The women sing and dance first, and the men wear Western-style suits, either half or full suits, and leather shoes. The women are mostly barefoot and dance on the floor, wearing colorful single-layer clothing. The youngest of the women are only fourteen or fifteen years old. However, whenever I observe men and women in society, men always take the offensive, while women take the defensive. When men encounter a member of the opposite sex, they always become frenzied, while women are hesitant and do not show much of a smile. There were also Chinese entering the field to watch. Black, white, and yellow faces crowded around, and the night scene was also magnificent. It was after ten o'clock, and the dancing had not stopped. I then went to bed.</p>
<p>There are four types of calendars here: 1. the solar calendar, 2. the lunar calendar, 3. the Malay calendar, and 4. the Muslim calendar. Their New Year festivals are different, and each has its own New Year. Spending one year here is like spending four years. The language and writing are even more complex. In general, four languages are used on trams and announcements: 1. English, 2. Chinese, 3. Muslim script, and 4. Malay. The so-called Muslim script is a type of Indian script because many Indians are Muslims. Even though it is the same Chinese language, people from different provinces cannot understand each other, so the national language movement is the top priority in the Southern Seas.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to the principle of the struggle for survival, I don't know what the Malay people feel about their New Year. This was originally their land. They are truly the masters of this land. Now, the primary political master is the British government, and the secondary economic masters are the Chinese and Japanese. They are truly living a life of slavery. However, looking at the tragic cases everywhere, how can we have so many tears to spare to mourn for the Malay people? In short, until the world is unified, national equality can only be sought in a pile of blood. The Indians of America are the old masters of America. The Taiwanese aborigines are the old masters of Taiwan. The Miao people in the caves of China are the old masters of the country. Alas! How can I ask the Buddha to explain the cause and effect of this?</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence (52) Liu Haisu</h3>
<p>Movie Theaters in Paris</p>
<p>Movies were not originally something I liked to watch very much. But after we arrived in Paris, we became a little fond of them. I and a few friends go to see one at least once a week. We savor the changes on the screen, listen to the unique rhythms and surprising harmonies of the music, and especially during the intermission, drink a cup of coffee and watch the light movements of the beautiful women, which is extremely enchanting. Getting two hours of leisure can comfort six days of labor. After watching, I always sleep very soundly. The next morning, I get up and continue my studies. Whether going to the library, the art academy, painting, or reading, I feel very comfortable. In addition to studying hard, we must also have some casual leisure and entertainment to make life feel meaningful. The leisurely and innocent life of burning incense and sitting quietly is certainly what I love very much. In fact, I did live such a life for a period of time in China, and at the same time, I painted orchids and bamboos and silently recited the Tao Te Ching. But going to see the charming and intoxicating places also has a special rich and plump taste. These are all necessary for life. People often regard entertainment as improper, which is truly strange. Therefore, Chinese social life is extremely dry and crude.</p>
<p>There are more than 140 movie theaters in Paris. Among them, the largest in scale is the Gaumont-Palaceo, the newest in architecture is the Paramanto, the most expensive tickets are Madeleine and MarivauxPaiheo, and there are countless district movie theaters with electric bells ringing at the door. The so-called district movie theaters are those small movie theaters scattered in various districts, specially prepared for the entertainment of workers and small merchants. The seats in those movie theaters are also very cheap. However, the films are always old films that have been shown in the large movie theaters. We sometimes also patronize them. From the ticket office, we drag a long tail of two or three zhang [Chinese unit of measurement] and proceed in order to buy tickets. Sometimes this tail can line up all the way to the street. Despite the large number of people and the long time, everyone still stretches their necks and waits quietly to move forward in order. We sometimes also go to stand in it, stretching our necks and waiting, and we feel a different flavor. A Mr. Fu is impatient and often slips away halfway. I often have such a concept: waiting like this to watch a movie, if it were in China, people might be fighting and bleeding. Here, you can also say something about social order. As for the Madeleine and Marivaux, they are exactly the opposite, truly aristocratic and extremely luxurious. The films they show are always brand-new American films being shown for the first time in Paris. A ticket must be shown for at least a month. At the gate, there are many waiters in formal attire to open car doors and guide people. The decorations inside are truly magnificent and grand, and they are really surprisingly remarkable. The seats are also extremely comfortable. Every time during the intermission, you can go to smoke and drink. Tickets are sold very expensively, at least twenty francs or more. We are all poor people and generally cannot afford to go often. Only wealthy people often run to Madeleine and Marivaux to join in the fun.</p>

<h3>Commercial News</h3>
<p>Financial Market Stable, Interbank Lending Slightly Up</p>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the previous period. Banks usually have no market situation. Only the money market opened various market prices in the morning and afternoon. The interest rate was 7 qian 2 fen 2 li 2 hao 5 si [units of currency], which was mostly similar to the afternoon market price the day before. Interbank lending was slightly tighter due to the value period being a week. The morning and afternoon markets opened at 7 fen [units of currency], which was slightly higher by 1 or 2 fen [units of currency] compared to the previous day. Foreign exchange transactions were made. In the morning market, remittance and draft transactions were 380,000 [currency unit]. There were no transactions in the banknote market, but 44,000 [currency unit] were made outside the market. In the afternoon market, remittance and draft transactions were 270,000 [currency unit]. Banknotes were still only made outside the market for 53,000 [currency unit]. Banks stopped buying and selling as usual. Money houses cleared 2.78 million public silver taels, and foreign exchange clearing had no market as usual. More than 23 million public silver taels were cleared. Tea merchants remitted funds of more than 1.3 million [currency unit] for tea purchases, and more than 1 million [currency unit] were remitted for wheat purchases. Silk cocoon merchants pre-remitted 500,000 [currency unit] in silver and 800,000 [currency unit] in banknotes. Small money houses traded 300,000 to 400,000 [currency unit]. The market situation for subsidiary currency was as follows: Jiangsu small silver was 6 qian 2 fen 9 li in the morning market and 6 qian 2 fen 9 li 5 hao in the afternoon market. 2,000 jiao [unit of currency] were traded in the morning market and 3,000 jiao [unit of currency] were traded in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver was 5 qian 9 fen 9 li 8 hao 7 hu [unit of currency] in the morning market and increased by 625 in the afternoon market, exceeding 6 qian at the Guanzhong, reaching 6 qian 0 hao 0 li 5 si [unit of currency]. 100,500 jiao [unit of currency] were traded in the afternoon market and 85,000 jiao [unit of currency] were traded in the afternoon market. It is said that silk cocoon merchants were purchasing Guang silver and purchased 50,000 to 60,000 jiao [unit of currency] yesterday, so the market sentiment was better. Copper coins were reduced to 387,500 wen [unit of currency] from 500 wen [unit of currency]. More than 26,000 strings [unit of currency] were traded.</p>
<h3>End-of-Month Long-Term Continuations</h3>
<p>The total amount of end-of-month long-term contracts that must be settled this time is more than several tens of millions. The amount of funds already released by Shanghai and Ningbo currencies is less than one-tenth or two-tenths. Therefore, most of the large transactions have not yet started. Yesterday, people in the industry said that Shanghai banks were receiving more funds than they were releasing. Even if there are continued transfers, it is estimated that the total will be less than half. However, Ningbo banks, within the reach of the overall situation, will definitely not withdraw funds and will release them by exchanging accounts. It is heard that transactions of more than 1 million Ningbo currency were made yesterday, with interest rates of 8 liang 5 qian and 9 liang 2 qian 5 fen. Less than 1 million were made by Shanghai banks. Under this situation, the settlement procedures at the expiration date will be several times busier than last year.</p>
<h3>Tea Funds Flowing Back</h3>
<p>In the past two weeks, the foreign funds used for tea purchases shipped from various ports have gathered into a considerable amount. According to reports from nearby tea areas, the foreign funds obtained from the sales have been entrusted to banks to be sent to Shanghai one after another. It is estimated that more than 100,000 banknotes and 50,000 to 60,000 silver taels have come from Hangzhou. A part of the silver has been conveniently purchased by silk cocoon merchants and stored in Hangzhou banks, ready for use when the scales are opened at that time. The rice, wheat, and silk cocoon funds returned from various inland areas are also estimated to be more than 100,000.</p>
<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Rebound by Two Yuan Last Week</h3>
<p>The market situation was slightly stable, with 37.1 million yuan changing hands</p>
<p>Last week, the market situation of various government bonds in the local securities market was that, as the expiration date of the futures contracts approached, although transactions were not deserted, they were slightly quieter than the previous week. Looking at the daily trading process, the fourth and fifth days of the week were the busiest, reaching more than 8.7 million on the fifth day of the week and about 8.4 million yuan on the fourth day of the week. Both the first and third days of the week were less than 6 million yuan, and only 4.5 million yuan on the second day of the week. On the weekend, the market was closed one day earlier because futures contracts for April had to be prepared for settlement, with transactions of only 3.9 million yuan. The total number for the whole week was 37.1 million yuan, a decrease of more than 12 million yuan compared with the previous week. There were more transactions in the Sino-Japanese customs tax, with 4.29 million yuan for the April contract and 8.415 million yuan for the May contract. The consolidation and disbandment bonds were quite active, with only 695,000 yuan for the April contract, but 5.535 million yuan for the May contract. The others were far inferior to the previous ones, such as the rehabilitation bonds with 2.275 million yuan for the April contract and 2.67 million yuan for the May contract. The continued loan bonds were 2.1 million yuan for the April contract and 1.87 million yuan for the May contract. The reorganization six percent bonds were 950,000 yuan for the April contract and 3.01 million yuan for the May contract. The continued two-fifth bonds were 1.355 million yuan for the April contract and 770,000 yuan for the May contract. The troop reduction bonds were 125,000 yuan for the April contract and 1.785 million yuan for the May contract. The 96 government bonds were 365,000 yuan for the April contract and 410,000 yuan for the May contract. The seven-year bonds were 150,000 yuan for the April contract and 135,000 yuan for the May contract. The financial bonds were 135,000 yuan for the April contract and 60,000 yuan for the May contract. The spot market was still sparse, with a total of 145,000 yuan changing hands in one week, divided into 52,000 yuan for consolidation and disbandment bonds, 37,000 yuan for financial bonds, and 23,000 yuan for continued major bonds. The rehabilitation bonds were 15,000 yuan, and the others were only 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. There was no market for both the troop reduction and 96 bonds. As for the changes, the 96 bonds had few transactions, so there was no change worth mentioning for the whole week. Compared with the previous week, only the small consolidation and disbandment and troop reduction bonds have risen significantly in the past few weeks. Investors in the market are slightly idle, so although daily transactions are strong, the market price is stable and often fluctuates in a hovering state without major changes. As a result, consolidation and disbandment bonds rose by about one yuan compared to the previous week, and troop reduction bonds only rose or fell by two or three jiao [unit of currency]. Compared with the previous week, the difference is really large. As for the trend of market prices of other government bonds, the market demand is still strong, and they continued to rise sharply. From the beginning of the week to the weekend, they rose step by step, and the momentum did not weaken. The fourth and fifth days of the week saw stronger gains. Rehabilitation, customs tax, continued two-fifth, and continued loan bonds all jumped up quite a bit. As a result, they all rose by one yuan to two and a half yuan or so compared to the previous week. According to people familiar with the industry, the continued increase in bond prices is due to the current shortage of spot goods and the squeezing of short positions. The statistics of the highest and lowest price fluctuations of bond prices in one week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn Market Last Week: A Dilemma for Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Stalemate Throughout</p>
<p>Slightly Improved at the Weekend Due to Rumors</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market has been unusually calm for a week, with no signs of recovery. The reason is that both the bulls and bears are strong manufacturers, and the competition is fierce. Although the bears are collecting goods for delivery in large quantities, the buyers are also taking in large quantities, so the market situation has not risen or fallen and has been hovering between 52 and 3 yuan throughout the day. The rise and fall do not exceed one or two liang [unit of currency]. Transactions are quiet, so outsiders who see this stalemate dare not act rashly. Therefore, many empty boards have been opened for far-month contracts. At the weekend, there were rumors of a possible labor unrest, and the market sentiment turned stronger. However, the overseas cotton yarn market also showed a tendency to hover. The results of the standard yarn were that near-month prices rose by one or two liang [unit of currency] compared to the previous week, and far-month prices rose by four or five qian [unit of currency]. The transaction statistics were 71,300 bales. The sales of current yarn among foreign merchants still do not have large-scale transactions and lack the power to excite. This is really affected by the unstable current situation and the high price of rice this year. The three groups of Sichuan, Guangdong, and the inland areas bought more actively. It is estimated that 9,750 bales were purchased throughout the week. The market prices were that Japanese yarn was firm and domestic yarn was stable. The factories opened 3,000 to 4,000 bales, and Yihua Factory opened 6,000 bales. The three grades tended to fall. The purchase amount of each group is recorded below:</p>
<p>Group Number of Pieces Group Number of Pieces Group Number of Pieces</p>
<p>Sichuan 2,900 Shantou 390 Inland 10,100</p>

<p>Ningbo 160 Nanyang 210 Jinan 940</p>
<p>Fujian 110 Xiamen 100 Miscellaneous Groups 130 Fellow Traders 1,800</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Last Week: High Prices</h3>
<p>Finally Setback by Talk of Labor Unrest</p>
<p>The cotton market was firm and rising. Because the bottom goods were weak and the overseas cotton market was calm, the sources from all sides were sparse, so the Han merchants had a strong bullish mentality. Dong cotton was squeezing short positions in the near month, so the market situation was relatively solid. Retail investors saw that the overall situation was not good and had to cover short positions. However, each factory's demand was silent, and most of them were full of Indian cotton and had no intention of urgently handling local cotton. Therefore, the rising momentum was relatively gentle. At the weekend, there were rumors of labor unrest, and people's minds were relaxed. As a result, each month fell by two or three qian [unit of currency] compared to the previous week. The transaction statistics for the whole week were 184,600 dan [unit of weight]. The sources on the docks were estimated to be 5,630 bales of Tong cotton and 2,510 bales of Yao cotton. The amount of cotton bought by factories was estimated to be 7,276 dan [unit of weight], and the amount of cotton taken in by trading companies was 3,280 dan [unit of weight]. The amount of cotton taken in by each factory and purchased by trading companies is recorded separately below:</p>

<h3>Declining Trend of American, British, and Indian Cotton Markets Not Weakening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, but later weakened due to better weather and the closing of long positions. The futures fell by 6 to 10 points, and the spot price fell by 5 points. British cotton futures fell by 5 or 6 points, and the spot price fell by 10 points. The spot price of Egyptian cotton was unchanged. The Indian cotton market situation was firm and stable. Pingguo Er's near and far terms fell by 2 rupees, Aomula fell by 1 rupee, and the far term fell by 2 rupees. Bairo Creek's near and far terms fell by 1 rupee.

<h3>Silk and Tea: Extreme Softening of Silk Market Last Week</h3>
<p>New Silk Has Few Inquiries, Chen Silk Telegrams Are Silent</p>
<p>An Unprecedentedly Tragic Scene of New and Old Metabolism</p>
<p>In the past week, the local foreign silk market was sluggish to the extreme. New cocoons from various provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were quickly launched on the market. In previous years, at this time, new cocoon period silk must have been thrown out in thousands of bales. Now, however, new cocoon futures from Shanghai factories, excluding the most superior brands such as Xinchang, Ruilun, Yongtai, etc. (factory map brand, gold and silver cat brand, gold double deer brand, etc.) have been thrown out until the 7th or 8th month, not to mention. Mid-level grades have only been thrown out in a few hundred bales by Qianli, priced from 1,000 taels to 1,020 or 30 taels. The various English and French banks are watching and waiting. Although the existing stock of Chen cocoon current silk is not sufficient, there are still few telegrams from overseas. A total of more than one hundred bales were transacted throughout the week. The reason for this is that the demand for raw silk in Europe and the United States has been greatly reduced and man-made silk has almost completely invaded the sales market. Since the Japanese government has allocated funds to protect silk prices and compensate silk merchants for their losses, it still has little effect and silk prices are still weak. European sales cannot afford to buy existing silk, and the quoted price is only 1,200 yen for the near term and 1,050 or 60 yen for the recent term and 1,000 yen for the far term. Shanghai manufacturers are very eager to throw out new silk and have sent telegrams overseas with a mid-level silk price of 1,000 taels, but telegrams are still rare. The lack of vitality in the silk market is really an unprecedented phenomenon in the years before the metabolism of new and old silkworm silk. Chinese silk merchants are all pessimistic. The prices of Chinese silk in the European and American markets have been falling since the Christmas holiday due to the cheap prices of Japanese silk. The market prices of overseas Chinese silk at the end of last week are listed below (unit: gold yuan per pound in New York, unit: francs per kilogram in Lyon):</p>

<h3>Hardware and Military: Smooth Sales of Military Hardware</h3>
<p>In the past week, the intake of various groups of hardware transactions has been slightly inferior, so there are few special circumstances in the city. However, the business of military hardware products has recently become increasingly popular. Therefore, there have been huge transactions in the market for items such as garden lead wire, coarse lead wire, purple steel, green lead, black iron sheet, and black mouth iron. However, the market goods of garden lead wire and coarse lead wire have been exhausted, so various firms are rushing to handle overseas purchases, which makes Shanghai feel even better. It is estimated that the goods handled the day before yesterday included 1,200 bundles of coarse lead wire, 1,000 bundles of garden lead wire (including 600 bundles of futures), 490 dan [unit of weight] of purple copper, 100 tons of green lead, 500 boxes of tinplate, 60 barrels of white lead sheet, and 700 to 800 dan [unit of weight] each of black iron sheet and angle iron.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Disturbance on Yunnan Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>A Large Number of Young Men and Women Detained</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:56 AM, near the Dongxin Bridge on Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession, several hundred people gathered. They then proceeded to the Renji Shantang (charity hall) to hold a meeting, but were unsuccessful. Over a hundred people were arrested by the police. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Young People Arriving in Succession</p>
<p>Initially, the local military and political authorities and the concession police had received secret reports. Therefore, yesterday morning, the Public Concession police dispatched many plainclothes detectives to patrol various roads. Plainclothes detectives were densely deployed in the Dongxin Bridge area of Zhejiang Road. For a time, there were many pedestrians who stopped to watch the commotion. However, they soon dispersed, as it was only about 8 o'clock at this time. At 9:20 AM, the teahouses, wine shops, and small alleys in the Dongxin Bridge area suddenly became tense. Young students, male and female workers, came in groups of three or five, one after another.</p>
<p>Gathering on Yunnan Road</p>
<p>Around 9:50 AM, the number of pedestrians stopping to watch the excitement in the Dongxin Bridge area gradually increased. Suddenly, a firecracker sounded, and leaflets of various colors flew into the air with the sound of the firecracker and scattered on the ground nearby. Before the firecracker was set off, plainclothes detectives had been constantly searching pedestrians and preventing groups of more than ten people from gathering together. At this point, although the firecracker went off, everything remained quiet. The crowd dispersed and then gathered again, entering the Renji Shantang through the back door. As they were electing a chairman, police officers arrived. In addition to the plainclothes detectives, there were also several red and black motor vehicles, which surrounded the Renji Shantang. Many foreign police officers entered and arrested over ninety people on the spot, as well as over ten people on the road outside the door. It was said that a total of 101 men and eight women were arrested. Four women were temporarily released. Together with a large number of leaflets and printed materials, they were loaded into cargo trucks and taken back to the police station.</p>
<p>Martial Law in the French Concession</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Fei of the French Concession Police announced martial law yesterday. In addition to ordering all subordinate police stations to strengthen precautions, he also dispatched over ten additional foreign detectives. Each foreign detective led eight armed Chinese and Vietnamese police officers and was dispatched to the areas bordering the Chinese and French concessions: Xieqiao, Ximen, Nanyang Bridge, and Minguo Road, as well as the areas bordering the British and French concessions: the intersection of Xizang Road and Avenue Edward VII. They were stationed in key areas. He also ordered all detectives to depart in teams to patrol and inspect the new and old concessions and the Great World entertainment center on Minguo Road and report at any time. At 11:30 AM, due to the tense situation in the Public Concession, the Great World amusement park, being directly in the line of fire, was temporarily ordered to cease operations. The iron gates of Xieqiao, Xujiahui, Xiaobeimen, Dongxin Bridge intersection, Zhengjia Muqiao intersection, Mofang Street intersection, Tianzhutang Street intersection, Xiaodongmen, and other places where the Chinese and French concessions connected were closed. Traffic was refused passage. Only the small iron gates on the sidewalks on both sides were left open for pedestrian traffic. The precautions were extremely tight. It was said that the situation was even tighter in the evening.</p>
<p>Temporary Suspension of Great World</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 12:00 PM, just as the Great World amusement park had opened for business, suddenly a group of about ten people, resembling students and workers, rushed in from Yunnan Road in the Public Concession. Since yesterday was a Sunday, tourists were arriving in droves. The park was ordered by the French Municipal Council to suspend operations immediately. The iron gates were closed, and all sixty-one tickets that had already been sold were returned. A large sign was temporarily hung at the entrance stating that operations were suspended by order. Patrolmen and detectives were stationed there. As a result, the general tourists came with enthusiasm but returned disappointed. It was not until about 6:00 PM in the evening that ticket sales resumed and business returned to normal.</p>
<p>Precautions in West Shanghai</p>
<p>Factories were densely located in the Caojiadu area of West Shanghai. The section chief of the Sixth District was ordered yesterday to announce martial law. Starting at 8:00 AM, in addition to adding double-post patrols, he also selected capable police officers to patrol back and forth in shifts on Avenue President Doumer, Route des Soeurs, Connaught Road, and Robison Road. The Public Security Bureau also sent forty fully armed security police officers to be temporarily stationed in the Kangjiaqiao Temple, ready to be deployed at any time. By 6:00 PM in the afternoon, the precautions were even tighter. All vehicles and pedestrians were required to undergo strict inspection before being allowed to pass.</p>
<p>Preparations in the Southern City</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the southern city area, from Laoximen along Minguo Road to Dongxin Bridge, Laobeimen, Xinkai River, all the way to Xiaodongmen, all subordinate district offices added armed police officers to guard key locations and dispatched small teams to patrol various roads. The detective team and the inspection office also sent personnel to take action. The defense was extremely thorough. Therefore, nothing happened yesterday until night.</p>
<p>Strict Defense in Zhabei</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau of each district in Zhabei dispatched additional posts at key locations to strengthen defense. Patrol police officers patrolled the streets and searched pedestrians. At important entrances and exits such as the Xinzha Bridge embankment, soldiers were added to the stations. The defense was quite strict, so everything was exceptionally peaceful.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Immigrants Leaving Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Only 315 in the First Batch</p>
<p>The Zhejiang immigrants going to the Northeast, already on the Huayang ship, were delayed for two more days while waiting for those from Hangzhou Prefecture to be transported to Shanghai. However, yesterday, disaster victims from Hangzhou Prefecture had not arrived by evening. Also, due to the long delay in departure, many had secretly gone ashore and fled back to their hometowns in recent days. Therefore, the transportation committee members, He Zhengrong and Hu Ruyin, decided yesterday that they would no longer wait in Shanghai. They decided to depart at 9:00 AM this morning, taking advantage of the morning tide. There are currently 315 people on board who, after examination by doctors, are deemed fit to go to the Northeast. Even if more immigrants arrive, they will have to wait for the second batch to be sent.</p>

<h3>The Truth About the Mishap of the Japanese Ship Shinkichi Maru</h3>
<p>Guangli Ship Rescues Crew</p>
<p>The Japanese ship Shinkichi Maru had an accident off Shantou. Shanghai was full of rumors that its entire crew had been taken away by pirates. Yesterday, the Guangli ship, which rescued the Japanese ship, arrived in Shanghai at 2:00 PM. The details of the Shinkichi Maru's accident and the Guangli ship's assistance, as described by its crew, are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>The Japanese Ship Hit a Reef</p>
<p>The Japanese ship Shinkichi Maru was transporting over 1,000 tons of coal from Taiwan to Guangdong. While traveling to the east sea area of ​​Shantou, outside the Lama Island lighthouse, it went the wrong route due to heavy fog and hit a reef of Xiaozhou Island outside the lighthouse. The hull was penetrated by the reef, and the ship flooded. It sank in an instant. There was no radio on board, so the crew had to find ways to escape.</p>
<p>The Crew Escaped to the Lighthouse</p>
<p>There were a total of twenty-six crew members and sailors on the Shinkichi Maru, including seven Japanese, such as the captain, first mate, and chief engineer, and nineteen Chinese sailors, all from Shandong. After the accident, seeing the ship sinking into the sea, and with no ships passing by at the time, the crew and sailors raced to release the lifeboats. They used a total of two flat-bottomed boats, carrying four or five people each, and sailed through the fog to the Lama Island lighthouse to take temporary refuge, intending to seek help when a ship passed by. It was not until the last batch of crew members got into the flat-bottomed boat that they were discovered by Guangli. Guangli Rescued and Sent to Xiamen</p>
<p>Three hours after the Japanese ship had the accident, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Guangli ship, happened to be on its way from Guangdong to Wenzhou, passing by Lama Island. The shipowner, Ai Wensheng, used binoculars to view the route. At that time, the fog was gradually receding, and he saw a distress flag hanging on the lighthouse, and also saw a ship crash on Xiaozhou Island. He seemed to see a small sampan carrying many people coming through the waves. The Guangli shipowner immediately ordered the ship to anchor and stop, and used flag signals to inform the people in the sampan that they had come to rescue them. The captain of the Shinkichi Maru, who was in the small boat, immediately had all the crew transferred to the Guangli ship. They then went to the lighthouse again and transferred all those who had been rescued earlier to the Guangli. After all twenty-six crew members were rescued onto Guangli, Guangli provided them with food, and then, according to the Japanese request, sent this group of people ashore in Xiamen.</p>
<p>Fishing Boats Mistaken for Thieves</p>
<p>After the crew left, the wrecked ship was completely abandoned. Because the bottom of the ship was stuck on the reef, half of the hull was still exposed above the sea. There were many fishing boats fishing in the area near Xiaozhou Island. Since there was no one on board the Japanese ship, the fishing boats competed to go to the ship to take away items. The lighthouse, however, mistakenly thought they were thieves. At that time, because the Guangli ship had sent a radio message after rescuing the crew, the Japanese warship in the outer sea of ​​Shantou received it first and rushed to the site of the Shinkichi Maru accident, almost mistaking the Chinese fishing boats for pirate ships. Fortunately, the fishing boats left immediately, and no tragedy occurred.</p>
<p>Estimated Loss of the Sunken Ship</p>
<p>At present, the Japanese ship still has one deck exposed to the sea, and all the coal in the ship has sunk. The loss of the ship and cargo is estimated to be over 100,000 yuan. Some of the crew's luggage and other items were taken out. It is said that the Japanese are still planning to salvage the sunken coal.</p>

<h3>The Call of Friends for the Zhejiang Tang Pagoda</h3>
<p>The Tang Pagoda of Beisi Temple in Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province, since it was proposed by one or two ignorant village chiefs to be demolished and sold on the grounds of danger, and County Magistrate Fang Li ignored government orders and violated public opinion, endorsing the demolition and sale proposal, which aroused opposition from the people of the county. The various situations have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. The Pinghu fellow villagers association in Shanghai immediately convened an emergency meeting after receiving this information, resolutely opposing it. On the one hand, they sent a telegram to the county to stop it, and on the other hand, they appealed to the authorities. Subsequently, local gentry Shen Weiqi, Cheng Jun, Jin Zhaofan, Ge Sitong, Ji Zhaolin, etc., submitted petitions to the central government and provincial government, requesting repairs to preserve the historical sites and comply with public opinion. Now, among the foreign responders are Fan Gunong from Jiaxing and Wang Yiting from Wuxing. However, it is reported that the demolition side is still discussing having the Fourth District Party Department nominate and submit a letter to the County Party Department, which will then forward it to the County Government, according to the wishes of the village committee, to demolish it as soon as possible. The County Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai believes that these actions of not understanding the principles are a deliberate violation of public opinion and has decided to raise it again at the thirteenth meeting to make further expressions. The various documents and telegrams regarding this case are recorded below:</p>
<p>Instructions from the Ministry of Interior</p>
<p>Letter No. 44 from the Ministry of Interior to Li, the original submitter, Pinghu Shen Weiqi, etc., stated that the Pinghu Beisi Twin Pagodas are famous historical sites in western Zhejiang. Now, some people in the area have decided to demolish them on the grounds of danger. They earnestly request separate telegrams to stop it and allocate funds for repairs. The telegram has been noted, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government has been ordered to instruct the County Government to handle it accordingly. You are hereby informed.</p>
<p>Urgent Telegram from Fellow Villagers in the Capital</p>
<p>The telegram from fellow villagers in the capital to the county magistrate stated: The twin pagodas of Beisi Temple in our county were built in the Tang Dynasty, more than a thousand years ago, and are among the few historical sites in western Zhejiang. According to the laws and regulations of the National Government and the Ministry of Interior, they should be preserved. Recently, we heard that there is a proposal to hire workers to demolish them, but the people of the county have not yet reached a consensus. We earnestly request compliance with public opinion and preservation of the historical sites. The Pinghu fellow villagers in the capital, Xi Youxin, Zhang Dalai, Cui Jingfu, Zhang Chufang, Wang Jingren, Xu Shuru, Zhang Zhuoshen, and Xue Xungu, respectfully.</p>
<h3>County Government Proclaims Uniform Silkworm Seed Prices</h3>
<p>Shanghai County Government issued a proclamation yesterday, stating: It has been received a directive from the Agriculture and Mining Department of Jiangsu Province, stating: According to the reports from the Zhenjiang Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Plant of the China United Mulberry Sericulture Improvement Association and the Jiangsu Silkworm Seed Industry Association, our association received a letter from your department in December of last year, stating that unscrupulous merchants were randomly distributing silkworm seeds and raising seed prices. We humbly request that you promptly issue an order to strictly prohibit it. Our country's exports have always been dominated by raw silk. Since Japan has been keen on improving, our country's silk industry has plummeted. The government, in view of this, has vigorously sought to improve. Various farms and seed manufacturing plants use scientific methods to manufacture improved silkworm seeds. They have recently gained the deep trust of silk cocoon producers and farmers. However, there are unscrupulous merchants who take the opportunity to sell them, thinking they are a rare commodity, or raise prices, doubling or even more the original value, or mix in inferior seeds and sell them under false names. At the 23rd County Government Meeting, it was resolved to request the Agriculture and Mining Department to unify the prices of silkworm seeds from various seed manufacturing plants and issue an order to strictly prohibit the random manufacture of inferior seeds to maintain the silk industry, etc. Accordingly, it is considered feasible to unify the prices. In addition to issuing instructions and sending separate letters, we hereby send a letter to your association, together with the China United Mulberry Sericulture Improvement Association and the Zhenjiang Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Plant, to properly determine the value of purebred, hybrid, and autumn silkworm seeds for the spring crop separately, and we hope to receive a reply for our benefit, etc. It has been found that the seed manufacturing plants of our association had a meeting in October of last year to formulate a uniform price method, which has long been implemented. At that time, the agreed-upon seed prices were as follows: Spring purebred seeds, 60 cents per sheet of Xin Yuan, 70 cents per sheet of Zhi Jiu, 80 cents per sheet of Zhu Gui; Spring hybrid seeds, 1 yuan per sheet of Hu Can No. 1, 1 yuan per sheet of Hu Can No. 2, 1 yuan per sheet of Hu Can No. 3, 80 cents per sheet of Hu Can No. 4, 1 yuan per sheet of Hu Can No. 5, 1 yuan per sheet of Hu Can No. 6; Autumn seeds, 1 yuan and 20 cents per sheet. After receiving the letter from your department this time, we immediately invited various seed manufacturing plants and the Zhenjiang Seed Manufacturing Plant to schedule a meeting. The first time, due to the short time, the Zhenjiang Plant could not attend. It was not until mid-February of this year that an agreement was reached to handle it in accordance with the prices set in mid-October of last year. As for the merchants raising prices and mixing in inferior seeds, they should be strictly prohibited, but the matter falls within the scope of administration, which our association cannot stop. We should request your department to notify the county governments to order their subordinates to strictly prohibit them, and to present the agreed-upon situation for your review, which would be convenient for the public, etc. Accordingly, it has been found that the prices proposed by the plant, etc., are appropriate and should be approved. In addition to issuing instructions and separate orders, the County Government is hereby ordered to promptly proclaim it to the public, and to order its subordinates to strictly prohibit merchants from raising prices and mixing in inferior seeds, so as to eliminate malpractices. It is still necessary to report the situation of compliance for investigation. This order, etc. In addition to issuing separate orders, this proclamation is hereby issued. The public and people of all kinds should all comply and must not raise prices or mix in inferior seeds, which will lead to investigation. Be sure to do this.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants Prepare to Collect Spring Cocoons</h3>
<p>Spring cocoons in various prefectures of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are about to hit the market. In Jinhua, Lanxi, and Yuhang, where the cocoons are the earliest, the large batch of silkworms will be sleeping heavily and flourishing with leaves. Around the 5th or 6th of the month, the new cocoons can be expected to be weighed and sold. The silk cocoon merchants and cocoon collectors in this port are also preparing to set off. Jardine Matheson of the British and Pao-Ke A-mi-da of the Italian always send personnel with money to Hangshao and other prefectures to invest in the purchase of fresh cocoons. Because the departure is imminent, the consuls general of Britain and Italy have sent letters to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asking them to instruct the local officials of each prefecture to protect them in accordance with the contract.</p>

<h3>Rice Ship Household Increase Capital Movement</h3>
<p>Shanghai's various help of rice boat households, the wages set by the associates, each help are not uniform. Recently, the boat crew because the level of living is getting higher and higher, the income is not enough to cover the expenses, so they launched an increase in wages, and require medical expenses for work-related injuries to be borne by the shipowner. Yesterday, they convened various help of ship crew in Shanghai to discuss the measures in Nanshi Yizhichun. They all said that our boat crew have low wages, and they also have to endure hard work. On the way, they cannot be shielded from the heat, they cannot avoid the cold, and if they encounter robbery, their lives are in danger. If they are sent to the hospital, the shipowner will not pay for medical expenses. At this time of difficult livelihood, if they do not increase their capital, how can they survive? Now, each help has representatives, and they should discuss and agree on the wages, and all wages should be increased by 30% uniformly. If there are temporary insertions, the wages should be negotiated temporarily for a period of 10 days. Then, it was discussed that if a partner on the boat is injured and his life is endangered, all medical expenses in the hospital should be paid by the shipowner. As for the compensation item, it is important, and the measures must be discussed after the wages are resolved.</p>
<h3>Hanzhong China Foreign Relief Association's Appeal for Aid via Telegram</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices: Hanzhong is situated in a remote mountainous region, known for its barren land and impoverished people. Since 1927, drought has been rampant every year. Last year's severe drought was unprecedented in recent decades. Rainfall was scarce, rivers and lakes dried up, resulting in crop failure and unemployment for the people. Although some wetlands yielded a small harvest, it was only about two or three percent. Hanzhong's population is estimated to be over three million, of which two million two hundred to three hundred thousand are destitute, eight hundred to nine hundred thousand are poor, seventy to eighty thousand are middle class, and only a few tens of thousands are above middle class. Currently, due to the interruption of livelihoods and the depletion of resources, a thorough investigation reveals that in counties such as Lüeyang, Mianxian, Ningqiang, and the entire county, as well as the northwest area of Nanzheng, the northeast area of Baocheng, the northwest and east areas of Chenggu, and other counties such as Fengxian, Liuba, Xixiang, Yangxian, Zhenba, and Foping, approximately two hundred to three hundred thousand people have died from hunger, and about a million are on the verge of death. Refugees are everywhere, and people with gaunt faces are ubiquitous. Even those formerly considered middle class are becoming destitute and starving. Those above middle class have either declined or moved away due to the impact of disasters and banditry. Therefore, in these difficult times, it is impossible to provide relief, and in terms of seeking food, tree bark and grass roots have been completely consumed. Houses and furniture are being dismantled and sold cheaply in the market, but there are no buyers. Oxen and livestock have been slaughtered and eaten entirely. At this critical juncture between seasons, it is a matter of life and death for the disaster victims. If autumn crops cannot be sown again, this year's disaster will be more severe than last year, which is an undeniable fact. Furthermore, corpses are scattered across the fields with no one to bury them, and epidemics are breaking out, which cannot be contained. Thinking about the future, we cannot help but shudder. The members of this association, recognizing this situation, established the Hanzhong China Foreign Relief Association on March 19th of this year, with the sole purpose of charity, to handle disaster relief matters in various counties of Hanzhong. However, drawing a cake cannot satisfy hunger, and relief requires benevolent grain. We earnestly implore you to have compassion for the more than two million disaster victims in Hanzhong who are on the verge of death and swiftly allocate a large sum of relief funds to Hanzhong for distribution, so that they can survive and seek a livelihood, lest they all fill the ditches. We will all carry your kindness in our hearts forever. In haste, with tears in our eyes, we await your orders. Hanzhong China Foreign Relief Association, Standing Committee Members: Ba Mingshan, Delu, Gaoderenji, Jiali Zhu, Liu Bida, Liu Zongxiang, Lan Peiyuan, respectfully kowtowing.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Association's Fourth Relief Effort in Nankou</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association received a letter from She Guisheng, director of the Tianjin office for disaster relief, stating that the Nankou area in Hebei Province, following the disasters of war, has been plagued by natural disasters such as drought, floods, and locusts, resulting in consecutive years of crop failure. Now, at this juncture between seasons, the disaster victims are on the verge of death. Although your association has provided relief three times since last winter and this spring, at this critical moment of life and death, we must implore you to provide complete and thorough aid. Attached is a petition from Hao Zijing and several thousand other representatives of disaster victims from twenty-four villages in Nankou, requesting relief. Upon investigation, it was found that the disaster victims who had already received relief were in dire straits. Some would not survive without relief, and others, after receiving grain, kept the grain for spring planting and continued to eat tree bark and grass roots, waiting to be fed, presenting a pitiful sight. The previous three relief funds have already been insufficient. A fourth relief fund of five thousand yuan has been approved, but it is still difficult to distribute to those who will not survive without relief. We request an additional three thousand yuan, totaling eight thousand yuan, to ensure complete and thorough aid, so as not to waste the previous efforts. The association has telegraphed She Jun Guisheng, stating that the fourth relief fund for Nankou, the original five thousand plus the additional three thousand, totaling eight thousand yuan, will be allocated to the Tianjin Jiaotong Bank for use on a term basis, and will be used to provide relief and seeds to alleviate the suffering and save the people's lives.</p>
<h3>China Child Welfare Association Requests Legal Protection for Children</h3>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association, in view of the exceptionally cruel social abuse of children, has decided through its Child Protection Department to first address the Shanghai Special Municipality, the Shanghai Special District Court, the Second Branch of the Shanghai Higher Court, the Shanghai Local Court, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Shanghai French Concession, urging them to pay attention to cases of child abuse, implement protection policies, uphold discipline, and prohibit imitation. This will not only allow defenseless children to see the light of day but also build a national foundation for the Republic of China. The association respectfully submits its original letter as follows: Respected Sirs, Our association aims to promote, maintain, and protect children's rights, and to seek happiness for children through all possible means. The protection of defenseless children at present is a matter that urgently needs planning and implementation in order to achieve our purpose. Looking at the current social situation, it is clear that many boys and girls are either toiling in factories, working as apprentices in shops, engaging in peddling, or working as actors. Some are even sold as servants or fall into prostitution, while others are abducted and sold, or beg on the streets. These shocking scenes should be rectified. In Europe and America, there are organizations such as child protection societies, children's bureaus, children's laws, and juvenile courts, which provide comprehensive protection for children's rights. However, our country has not yet established many of these institutions, which is a deficiency. Recognizing the needs of the environment and the urgency of the matter, we have established a Child Protection Department within our association to specialize in this work. However, the so-called protection is related to the law in every aspect. In the event of an incident, the protection of the competent authorities is especially necessary to avoid obstacles. We have long admired your esteemed institution's dedication to benevolence and kindness, and we believe that you will not bear to see children's rights being exploited and will sympathize with our association's efforts. We respectfully present the following requests: (1) Please instruct your officers to pay special attention to cases of child abuse. (2) If there is a case of child abuse, please inform us in advance of the interrogation and allow representatives of our association to attend and observe. (3) When our association sends personnel to conduct on-site investigations of child abuse, please grant appropriate assistance. Our association will report the results of the investigation to your esteemed institution. (4) If your esteemed institution finds children who are homeless, our association will do its best to accommodate them. We hope that the above is appropriate. We ask that your esteemed institution review this matter, provide guidance, and cooperate with us to build the foundation of the nation and create the welfare of the country. Our association will certainly strive to follow and witness its success. Then the children of China will be fortunate, and the future of China will be fortunate. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby respectfully inform you and wish you peace and await your reply. China Child Welfare Association, Chairman Kong Xiangxi (seal).</p>

<h3>Tenants of Jiale Road Refuse to Erect Fence</h3>
<p>A portion of the houses in Yongxing Lane on Jiale Road in the French Concession is owned by the Chinese Jinji. The houses were built only four years ago. The landlord, through lawyer Lin Yingqing, notified the tenants that, upon the order of the Municipal Council, the houses must be completely rebuilt, and all tenants must vacate the premises by the end of March. The tenants were shocked upon hearing the news and were very apprehensive. They unanimously sent a letter to lawyer Lin Yingqing, requesting him to persuade the landlord to withdraw the order to rebuild the houses. They also sent a letter to the Municipal Council inquiring whether the council had ordered the demolition. The council replied that only two houses needed to be demolished to open up the road, and there was no order for complete demolition. After sending another letter to lawyer Lin, there was no response. The two sides have been in a stalemate for about half a month. Unexpectedly, the landlord obtained a rebuilding permit from the Municipal Council, hired workers, and suddenly dispatched them with bamboo to start work yesterday. The tenants, unaware of this beforehand, were in an uproar. Male and female tenants unanimously refused the workers, who had no choice but to stop working.

<h3>Murder at the Jiangwan Teahouse; Thief Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhu Shaoqin, a villager from a village about three miles northeast of Dachang Town in Baoshan, was from a moderately wealthy family. In the middle of this month, late at night, five or six bandits speaking the local dialect, armed with weapons, went to rob his home. The losses were significant. Zhu's eldest son, Fusheng, attempted to escape through the back door to report to the police when the bandits were robbing. He was spotted by the bandits and shot in a vital area with a pistol, resulting in his death. The bandits then fled with a roar. Afterwards, the victim Zhu Shaoqin immediately reported to the Dachang First Branch of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau and the Security Regiment to send detectives to investigate and arrest the criminals. However, because the bandits had fled far away, the case had not been solved. The previous morning, at about 8 o'clock, Zhu had business to go to Jiangwan. On the way, passing by the front of Dasi Temple, he suddenly saw a person sitting in a small teahouse. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the bandit, Fei Zheng, who had killed his eldest son that day with a gunshot. Zhu remained calm and quietly investigated the bandit's background in the vicinity, learning that the bandit's name was Gu Jingen, and he lived in the Baiyang Village north of Jiangwan Town. He would come to this teahouse to enjoy tea every morning and evening. Zhu immediately returned to Dachang to report to the Security Regiment. The regiment then dispatched the first team leader, Yao Yiqun, and the second team leader, Zhang Gusheng, leading members from both teams. They rushed to Jiangwan around 3 o'clock in the afternoon the day before, and together with the acting head of the local Security Regiment, Wang Jiting, led the members to surround the teahouse in front of Dasi Temple. The bandit, seeing the situation was not good, was about to escape, but it was too late and he was captured on the spot. Team leaders Wang, Zhang, and Yao, etc., then went to Baiyang Village north of the town to arrest the remaining bandits. Upon arriving at the bandit's home, they found that the whole family had already fled after hearing the news. They then escorted the bandit back to the Jiangxun Security Regiment headquarters for temporary detention. As the incident location was within the Baoshan County boundary, team leaders Yao and Zhang of the Dachang Security Regiment reported to the Baoshan County Magistrate Wu Jianong, who dispatched several police officers to Jiangwan at 10 o'clock yesterday morning to take the bandit to the county government for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Wife Sale Contract Becomes Ironclad Evidence</h3>
<p>Sun Tingbao's Wife and Daughter Cannot Be Retrieved</p>
<p>Yan Bacheng, a native of Huzhou residing at 1501 Haining Road, and Niu Juxuan, a clerk for a certain lawyer, were sued for disrupting the family by the Sun brothers, Sun Bao and Sun Rubao, who were from the same hometown. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Cheng of the Special District Court convened a hearing. According to Sun Tingbao, he came to Shanghai last July and asked Yan for help in finding a job, but without success. Yan was willing to lend me 240 yuan and asked me to go to Liuhe to open a shop. Niu wrote the IOU. I didn't know how to word it. By November, when I came to Shanghai from Liuhe, I realized that my wife and seven-year-old daughter had been tricked into Yan's house, and my wife had been taken. When I wanted to reason with him, Yan became unreasonable and said he would punish me. Now I am willing to repay the loan, but I must take my wife and daughter back, etc. Yan's lawyer presented a red paper contract to the court, claiming that it was a contract signed by Tingbao to sell his wife, Ru Jin, to Yan as a concubine for a price. He came to pester him again because he had run out of money. Yan was willing to give him another 150 yuan, but he still thought it was too little. The court can ask Ru Jin, etc. So Ru Jin testified that she married Tingbao at the age of 30, eight years ago. Because he was poor and unable to support her, he sold her to Yan as a concubine for 240 yuan. Yan Bacheng also testified that this was Tingbao's own will, and his brother Rubao had swindled 20 yuan from him afterwards, etc. Niu also admitted that he wrote the IOU. After the interrogation, Judge Cheng acquitted Yan and Niu and ordered Yan to give Sun Tingbao travel expenses so that he could return to his hometown.</p>
<h3>After Shen Dianru's Flight, Her Husband's Family Sues Again</h3>
<p>Dong Hanqin previously hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court, requesting that the marriage contract with his wife, Shen Dianru, who had not been prostituted, be valid. Shen filed a statement objecting to the marriage, claiming that it was not with her consent. As a result, Shen Dianru lost the case. Shen refused to accept the verdict and appealed. The second instance of the Suzhou Higher Court resulted in Shen still losing the case. Dong repeatedly applied to the District Court for enforcement, but Shen had fled, and the court could not summon her. Therefore, the case was suspended. Now Dong Hanqin has again hired lawyer Huang Yiyan to sue the Land Court, requesting compensation for damages and losses of jewelry and reputation, amounting to more than 10,000 yuan. Yesterday, Judge Huang opened a court session to hear the case. The plaintiff, Dong Hanqin, and his mother, Dong Zhu, both arrived in court as summoned. The defendant, Shen Dianru, did not arrive, but her mother, Shen Jin, represented her in court. The judge briefly questioned both parties and ordered them to wait for further review.</p>

<h3>Judgment in the Case of Enticing and Raping a Young Girl</h3>
<p>Yun Di is Indeed Sixteen Years Old</p>
<p>Pan Xiangbao Imprisoned for Four Years</p>
<p>Pan Xiangbao (also known as Wang Abao), a Shanghai rogue, enticed Yun Di, the daughter of Feng Tieshan, a native of Ningbo residing at 224 Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, to the Tongshang Hotel on Avenue Haig for fornication. Afterwards, he was arrested by the patrol and sent to the Special District Court. Because of the age of Yun Di, the case was adjourned for further investigation, as reported in previous newspapers. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu reopened the hearing. According to the patrol lawyer, although the defendant claimed that Yun Di was already 18 years old, her mother reported to the patrol when her daughter Yun Di went missing, stating that the girl was 16 years old. Now the girl's maternal uncle, Yu Jinghong, has arrived and can testify. So Yu testified that his niece Yun Di was born in October of the Republic of China year four and her zodiac sign is rabbit. After hearing Yu's words, the defendant still insisted that Yun Di told him that she was 18 years old and her zodiac sign is ox. Finally, the court appointed a lawyer to defend the defendant. Judge Xu immediately sentenced Pan Xiangbao to four years of imprisonment for the crime of enticing and raping a young girl.</p>
<h3>Yarn Discovered on the Yuanlun Ship</h3>
<p>Transferred from the Original Box to a Machine Box</p>
<p>But Still One Bolt Was Stolen</p>
<p>On the 23rd of this month, the Huang Yinchong merchant ship, managed by the Renji Company, arrived in port from overseas and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou to unload cargo. In the fourth hold of the ship, there was a large batch of yarn. Shortly after, two large boxes of yarn of different colors, totaling twelve bolts, were suddenly stolen without a trace, leaving only empty boxes in the hold. The victim discovered this and, considering the yarn's extremely high value and the strict security on land and water, pondered how the theft could have occurred. They sent personnel to report to the Customs Water Police Station, ordering them to arrest the thieves. For several days, detectives Wang Haiquan, Sun Agui, Cheng Yongnian, Zhu Yuncheng, Huang Zhenlin, and others from the police station conducted investigations. It was not until 6 o'clock the night before last that the stolen goods were discovered at the original wharf. The thieves, due to the strict land and water defenses, found it difficult to steal. They secretly placed the two boxes of yarn in other machine boxes on the ship. After the machine boxes were unloaded onto the wharf, they planned to secretly move the yarn out in the dark, hire a wooden boat, and escape by water. However, the waterway was guarded by the water patrol, making it impossible to proceed. The machine boxes were exposed for three days and nights. Before the discovery, the detectives carefully inspected each machine box and found that the nails of one box seemed to be loose, which was suspicious. They then, together with the foreman of the wharf, opened the machine box and found the lost yarn inside. Upon inspection, there were a total of eleven bolts, one bolt short, worth more than 1,000 yuan. The detectives immediately took the stolen goods to the police station, waiting for the owner to identify them. At the same time, they are still urgently pursuing the clever criminals who escaped, bringing them to justice.</p>
<h3>Co-residence Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Quarrel over Cutting Meat and Vegetables</p>
<p>Min Ran Gathers a Crowd to Commit Assault</p>
<p>Li Zhou, a woman residing at 17 Peifu Lane, 17 Huanghe Road, French Concession, hired a lawyer to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the French Court, stating that the plaintiff rented the house and was the second landlord, subletting the front building to Zuo Zhenwu, a foreigner, and the back building to Yan Chen and other women. The kitchen was for common use. On the 16th of this month, Gu, the wife of Zuo Zhenwu in the front building, was cutting fresh meat in the kitchen, and the plaintiff's maid told her that her mistress was a vegetarian and asked to cut vegetables first. Gu refused, leading to a dispute and being beaten. The plaintiff heard the noise, went downstairs to mediate, and dispersed them. Unexpectedly, on the 18th, Liu Zhang, Zuo's maid, was taking water from the tap when Yan Chen, a woman living in the back building, passed by and slightly bumped into her. Zuo's maid immediately insulted and scolded her. Then, Liu Xueshi, Zuo's male servant, came to help, using fire tongs to injure Chen's eye. The plaintiff and other co-residents, Deng Zhang, Wang Naimao, Qiu Er, etc., heard the noise and came forward to mediate, but they were also beaten by Liu Xueshi, who gathered many people to commit assault. Zuo Zhenwu, Liu's employer, and his wife, Gu, also ordered the assault. The defendants' violent behavior constitutes a crime, and they requested severe investigation and compensation for losses. The defendants also had a lawyer to defend them, claiming that Liu Xueshi was actually mediating when Liu Zhang had a quarrel with Yan Chen, but the plaintiff threw hot wontons from the pot at Liu's face, causing serious injuries. In fact, the defendants are the plaintiffs, requesting permission to file a counterclaim. Judge Zhu reviewed the statements and ordered them to leave and wait for another hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Carelessness at the Flag Tobacco Company on Yulin Road</h3>
<p>Two Machines Damaged by Fire</p>
<p>Significant Loss of Tobacco Leaves</p>
<p>The tobacco leaf room of the Flag Tobacco Company at 52 Yulin Road, Dalianwan Road, caught fire at 11:30 last night. The steam engine, due to excessive motor heat, suddenly emitted green smoke and ignited the tobacco leaves. In an instant, the fire blazed brightly, and thick smoke filled the air. Workers in the factory, seeing the fierce fire, rushed out in a surge, and order was immediately disrupted. The East District Fire Brigade, upon hearing the alarm, quickly drove fire trucks to put out the fire. It was extinguished at 12 o'clock. According to the investigation, the losses included two steam distillation machines destroyed by the fire, of great value, and a significant amount of tobacco leaves burned.</p>
<h3>Cheng Xiuzhen Doesn't Recognize Her Father After Leaving Home</h3>
<p>Transformation After Working in a Cotton Mill</p>
<p>Cheng Xiuzhen, a woman from Nantong, is now 21 years old. She was betrothed to someone in her youth. Last autumn, she came to Shanghai and worked in a certain cotton mill in Yangshupu, residing near her fellow villagers. Soon, she formed an unbreakable bond with Li Ajin (of similar age), a male worker from Ningbo in the same factory. They built a love nest in Dehe Lane, Xiangyan Bridge, Zhabei, living together like husband and wife. The incident was reported by Cheng's fellow villagers in a letter to her father, who came to Shanghai to look for his daughter but could not find her. He rented a place at 13 Jincheng Lane, Kaifeng Road, Zhabei, intending to find his daughter at any time. Unexpectedly, months passed without any news. The other day, Cheng's father, Qingsheng, bought cigarettes on Kaifeng Road when he suddenly saw a man and a woman walking hand in hand. The figure looked very much like his daughter, but because of her fashionable clothes, he did not dare to recognize her. He rushed home and called his wife to chase after them. Upon closer inspection, it was indeed his daughter, Cheng Xiuzhen. He immediately grabbed her, but Xiuzhen initially refused to acknowledge him. Later, her father twisted Li Ajin together and handed them over to the patrol police, who brought them to the Fourth District First Branch for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Songhu Rehabilitation Institute</h3>
<p>The Attached Civilian Clinic Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>The Songhu Rehabilitation Institute has been accommodating many vagrants and beggars recently, but most of them are carrying illnesses. Therefore, the board of directors of the institute specially hired Dr. Chen Rongzhang to serve as a voluntary doctor, and the Nanyang Medical College donated medicines and assigned another doctor to jointly manage the clinic. Currently, the number of sick inmates is decreasing daily. They also felt that the residents in the remote vicinity lacked a proper place to see a doctor. Therefore, starting from the 26th, every afternoon from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM, they will specialize in treating the poor and sick nearby. The consultation fee is completely waived, and only a registration fee of ten copper coins is charged to benefit the poor and sick.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Jiangsu Rice Association's Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Ninghu Municipal and County Rice Industry Association held its seventh joint meeting of directors and supervisors at Cuixiu Hall at 2:00 PM yesterday. Twenty committee members, including Ye Huijun, Zhao Zixin, Zhu Zixiang, and Chen Junyu, attended the meeting. Ye Huijun was publicly elected as chairman.

<h3>Male Corpse Found by the Pier</h3>
<p>Yue Nanting, a member of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's water patrol team, was patrolling the river by motorboat at around 9:00 AM yesterday when he discovered a man, about thirty years old, dressed in ragged clothes, resembling a coolie, lying dead by the No. 4 pier of the Dada Company on the 16th Wharf. He immediately returned to the team to report. Xu, the team leader, considering that it was a matter of life and death, ordered Lu Yongde, the local head of the 16th Wharf, to report to the Shanghai District Court for verification. Later in the afternoon, Prosecutor Lei, commissioned by the court, arrived at the scene with an examiner and determined that the unknown man had died of illness during his lifetime. As no family members were found, the local head was ordered to report to the court to provide a coffin for burial at the altar for recognition.</p>
<h3>Theft of Foreign Yarn Recovered with the Thief</h3>
<p>Wan Shang, a villager from Longhua Town in the southwest countryside, 47 years old, came to Shanghai to buy a large package of foreign yarn at about 10:00 AM yesterday. When he reached the Gongyi Wharf on the Bund and walked to the nearby Yihexing cigarette paper shop to buy cigarettes, he temporarily placed the foreign yarn he was carrying on the ground next to him. Unexpectedly, Liu Suochen, a thief from Anhui, saw it and pretended to buy cigarette paper, crowding next to Wan. Taking advantage of his carelessness, Liu stole the large package of foreign yarn placed by Wan and fled with the loot. Fortunately, Chen Housheng, the shop owner from Jiading, saw it, immediately went out to chase him, and managed to capture him and the loot at the Wanyu Wharf. He handed them over to Kang Chuanting, the guard police officer of the tenth post at the wharf, who brought them to the First Branch of the First District. During the preliminary trial by the station chief, Wan reported the previous situation. The station chief, considering the theft, ordered a document to be prepared and sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation, and ordered the victim to report to the bureau for instructions.</p>

<p>Youth Garden</p>
<h3>The Adults of Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The first National Boy Scout General Inspection recently held in the capital was not only a new epoch for Chinese Boy Scouts, but also a noteworthy event in the youth movement of our country in recent years. Although the groups attending this General Inspection numbered only one hundred and twenty-one, and the number of Boy Scouts was less than four thousand, the term "national" seemed very small. However, to those who understand the past situation of Chinese Boy Scouts over the past decade, it is known that this small seed has grown from germination to growth and from sowing to propagation. If it is properly cultivated and maintained, in another ten years, wouldn't this small seed bear a plump fruit in the youth garden? This excellent result is the "(Adults of Tomorrow)".</p>
<p>Indeed, Boy Scouts are a kind of game, a true game that uses a healthy environment to develop children's nature. We know that human beings have the ability to create and the inherent nature to appreciate nature, and children are particularly easy to develop these two characteristics. Sir Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of Boy Scout training, recognized this key point. In 1908, he created the book "Scouting for Boys." When the book was half completed, Britain already had a Boy Scout organization. What is discussed in this book is mostly Baden-Powell's experience gained from facts. From 1899 to 1901, he was stationed in South Africa as a soldier and saw that white people were far less hardworking and alert than the natives. Therefore, he created a scouting training for small teams, with six people in each team, often ordering them to be in close contact with team members, focusing on fieldwork, and developing automatic ability. Over time, the effect was very significant. This method of training was based on his training of Boy Scouts in Mafeking. The work of the Boy Scouts assisted in reconnaissance on marches. Their mental agility and sense of responsibility were far beyond expectations. Therefore, when he saw that adult soldiers were not doing their job, he thought of this kind of training to remedy it. Then, wouldn't it be more meaningful to apply this kind of training directly to children?</p>
<p>After Baden-Powell was transferred, he returned to England in 1903. Based on his book "Aids to Scouting," he discussed and researched with many educators and expanded its goals as the basis for training good citizens. In 1907, Baden-Powell gathered local children and primary school students on Brownsea Island for a camping experiment. He took his experience in training soldiers, combined it with the necessities of child psychology, and the ancient British and Irish methods of training children. In addition, he also selected the wilderness survival spirit of African natives and organizations such as Japanese youth groups, melting them into one furnace. The result produced under this mixed training exceeded Baden-Powell's expectations. The following year, he wrote the book "Scouting for Boys," which contains twelve chapters. Until now, Boy Scout coaches have regarded it as a bible. In 1910, the organization of Boy Scout troops in various parts of Britain flourished, with a number of more than 124,000. At that time, Baden-Powell decided to resign from military service and devote himself to the Boy Scout education movement. This is the origin of the world's Boy Scouts. The team on Brownsea Island in 1907 is also the originator of the world's Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>The origin of Boy Scout training has gone through many twists and turns. Although it is a kind of game, it does have great significance. Therefore, twenty years after the British founded the Boy Scouts, there were more than two million Boy Scouts worldwide, among which the United Kingdom and the United States were the most developed. The number of Boy Scouts in the two countries combined exceeded one million. However, the organization of Boy Scouts in various countries is mostly the same in principle, but not necessarily the same in essence. Each country has its own national character, and everyone has their own opinions. If you recognize your own goals and do it, you can fundamentally reach the great harmony. In short, Boy Scouts are the most valuable in modern youth training. Americans admire Baden-Powell and mention him alongside their founding father, George Washington. The American Boy Scout publication "Scouting" said, "(On February 22, 1732, a great man was born, who did supreme work for his country. One hundred and twenty-five years later, another great man was born, and we call him the (World Boy Scout Leader) because he did supreme work for the children of the whole world.)" Baden-Powell himself had a dream and hoped that the current youth alliance would achieve world peace in the future.</p>
<p>Boy Scout training should be modernized and should be tailored to the symptoms. Don't just follow what others say and imitate blindly. Chinese Boy Scouts have had a history of more than ten years. Although the effectiveness was not far-reaching before the Party took over, a seed has indeed been buried steadily. Chiang Kai-shek, the Chairman of the National Government, said during this General Inspection, "(Chinese Boy Scouts have had a history of more than ten years since their establishment, and have shown quite good results in the past. Since being under the guidance of our Party, they have had a central belief, a unified organization, and practical training, which is more progress than before...)" These words are really fair and thorough, and are worth a history of the development of Chinese Boy Scouts in the past ten years. The so-called central belief, unified organization, and practical training are what the current Party Boy Scouts should be fortunate for. With a central belief, the foundation is especially solid. With a unified organization, development is especially easy. With practical training, it is more progress than before. The (Adults of Tomorrow) are built on these three things.</p>
<p>In the first year of the Republic of China, a seed of Boy Scouts drifted in from overseas. After ten to twenty years of cultivation, although it cannot grow into a shade, it has indeed sprouted and grown tall. The reason why Chinese Boy Scout training cannot compete with others is fundamentally because it lacks the above three conditions. For example, if a seed falls in a stony field, where can there be hope of prosperity? If the gardener does not irrigate and prune, where can there be good results? The history of Boy Scouts in the past is this situation. Therefore, in the past of Chinese Boy Scout education, we can only say that it is incomplete development or a kind of physiological deformity. It is difficult to say that it is destruction or blind obedience. Further, the Boy Scout training itself is a meaningful and organized movement. Fundamentally, there should be no differences of opinion. Ten to twenty years, important courses, training, etc., are difficult to escape what has already been done. Extending to more than fifty countries with Boy Scout organizations around the world, I am afraid it is difficult to escape this example. All the things in the past can only be said to be different times and environments.</p>
<p>There are only more than 13,000 Party Boy Scouts in China now. Even if you add ten times that, it is only more than 100,000. If you increase it by fifty or sixty times, you can compete with Britain and the United States. Boy Scout training is a hopeful and purposeful work. Young people may as well work hard under the guidance of the Party. China lacks leaders and even more lacks meaningful organizations. Young people must not give up the great significance of Boy Scout training, (The Adults of Tomorrow).</p>

<h3>Details of the Increase in US National Wealth</h3>
<p>Increased by 37% in Sixteen Years</p>
<p>36,000 Million Yuan in 1928</p>
<p>According to a survey by the US Chamber of Commerce, the country's national wealth increased by 37% in the past sixteen years (1912-1928). This so-called national wealth refers to the assets of tangible things, excluding its circulating currency and claims, but including land, buildings, and other facilities. For the convenience of comparative calculation, assuming that the gold yuan is the same value after the war, the total national wealth of the country before the European War in 1912 was 18,630 million gold yuan. After the war, in 1922, it suddenly increased to 32,080 million gold yuan. In 1928, it further increased to 36,010 million gold yuan. Land and other real estate, excluding public welfare facilities such as railways, accounted for more than half of the national wealth, 19,810 million gold yuan, of which 3.2 million gold yuan was tax-exempt. The total of railway public welfare facilities and ships and canals was 3,950 million gold yuan. Farm equipment (including livestock) was 2,720 million gold yuan, gold and silver and currency were quite similar to automobiles.</p>
<p>In total, it is about 990 million gold yuan, which is about one-third of the national wealth. Also, in 1911, the country's national wealth per capita was about 3,300 gold yuan.</p>

<p>Art Circle</p>
<h3>A Brief Feeling about Mr. Nakagawa's Solo Exhibition</h3>
<p>Chen Baoyi</p>
<p>In China, where the art atmosphere is stagnant, we were fortunate to see several art exhibitions in Shanghai recently. Among them, Mr. Wang Gang's pattern exhibition and the solo exhibition of Japanese painter Mr. Akita gave us a very good impression.</p>
<p>These two days (26th and 27th, at the Japanese Club on Bang Road) we also encountered the recent works exhibition of Japanese famous painter Mr. Kiwoto Nakagawa. It can be said to be a pleasant phenomenon in Shanghai's art in recent years. In the past few days, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to see his works several times and have felt a deep impression. Now I will briefly describe a few words about my feelings.</p>
<p>Originally, Mr. Nakagawa has a special style. His expression is unusually clear and concise. I think those who have seen Mr. Nakagawa's works will probably feel the same way. This time, the works he exhibited are mainly landscapes made in Suzhou, as well as some still life paintings and figure paintings. Although the author himself said that it is not his representative style, I see that most of them are powerful works, and at the same time, we can see one side of his style. Although these are the gains in his short trip, the content and expression of the paintings are very solid and mellow, which makes me feel very happy. Mr. Nakagawa's creations can only be seen at the Nikakai exhibition every autumn. This time, we can see his recent works in Shanghai, which is a good reference for those of us who study art. It has to be regarded as a fortunate thing. Foreign writers have also occasionally held work exhibitions in Shanghai before, but most of them are not the decadent academic style type, but some superficial things that imitate others. I can't think of anyone who has ever had such energetic and fulfilling works as seen this time. I heard that Mr. Nakagawa comes from a family with deep Chinese studies, so he seems to have his own understanding of Chinese culture.</p>
