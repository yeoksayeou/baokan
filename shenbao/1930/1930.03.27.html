<h3 id="c7">關稅休戰會議之結果 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>今世界之兩大運動。一爲五强限制軍備之海軍會議一爲歐洲停止加稅之關稅休戰會議。夫關稅休戰之意義。固與軍事上防止未來之戰爭相同關於世界人民福利甚大。惟此二者之贊成與反對。必皆以已國自身之利害爲前提。工商業組織完備之國。目的祇求達到自由貿易者即與其他需要保護稅制之國。情形不同。又須觀察世界經濟之狀况。縱無向外競爭之野心然亦必預防外勢與環境之壓迫。故斯會爲歐洲經濟合作計。停止加稅固無不贊成者。但返而一究各國自身之利害。即難期一致。猶之海軍會議爲希望和平計。縮减軍備。無不表示同情。然返而一觀國際間之情勢。研究自身之利害。又皆觀望不前。不敢强爲贊同。其情形亦正相似。今者海軍會議。尚在相持。前途希望甚少。關稅休戰會議。雖已開末次會議。略有結果。然維持現有商約。其效僅及一年。與會之國。又未全體簽字。德代表之臨别贈言。謂此會之結果。未能實踐大衆之期望。惟列强間之經濟諒解。已因此趨近一步極言其效亦祗如此可見求達目的之難矣。</p>
<p>我再於歐洲而外。觀察各國之經濟狀况。印度方三讀通過新稅則如棉布糖火油等稅。均有增加。美國之新稅則。雖已通過於參院。然因與衆院原案主張</p>
<p>懸殊。將成爲爭執之焦點此亦可爲停止加稅不易實行之一旁證。夫以財政。</p>
<p>之常理言之。稅之增加與否。必視其國用財之程度以爲衡。收支足以相抵者。固無需乎加稅。收支不能相抵者。勢必取償於加稅。而收支不相抵之大原因。則在海陸軍費。試再以英日兩國之新預算言之。英之新預算。陸軍費爲四千萬金鎊。約合銀洋六萬萬元。工黨左翼議員提出要求每年大加裁减之修正案。卒被否决。天空費爲一千六百九十六萬鎊。較去年增加八十九萬鎊。日本之新預算陸。軍費爲二萬一千萬元。海軍費爲二萬六千二百萬元。亦不能大加减少。其理由皆以倫敦會議之成敗未定。國防費用之多寡難决。皆不願輕議裁减也。軍費旣不能輕易議减。則預算必易不敷。亦即停止加稅之議。必不易輕許。故吾謂此二大運動之難成。亦有相聯之關係者也。</p>

<p>家境富裕盜匪覬覦　朱小毛、年四十三歲、寳山縣人、妻孫氏、年亦相若、惟朱旣無兄弟、又無子息、僅夫婦兩人其家爲東維港之祖遺房屋　並有農田數畝、以資耕活、朱又在鎭上開設飯店、每日在店中照顧生意、留妻在家種田、所以開支省而生產力强、家境餘裕、致遭盜匪之覬覦</p>
<p>現洋均藏入褲帶袋　前日飯店收市後、朱取得市下現洋三十餘元歸家、而晚飯已畢、乃與妻共話、移時忘却將洋交付與妻　所有之洋　均藏褲帶袋内鄉人早息、旋即夫婦閉門睡眠、作黑甜鄉之游、</p>
<p>夜半盜來夫婦被縛　詎至午夜時分、外面擂門如鼓、朱夫婦爲驚醒、情知有異、不敢啓門　而朱因有三十餘元之故、乃將裤帶束縛身上、以免被刦、不圖門户已闢　進門者兩人、而外面則尚有人身、朱夫婦一見來者並非善類、噤若寒蟬、匪等遂加刦掠、僅得衣服五六件、藏洋之處、未被搜獲、匪等似係深知朱身畔有錢、乃剥刦其褲帶、朱愛財如命、極力掙扎、並呼救命　匪等惱怒、即將朱夫婦分别捆綁、先將朱之褲帶奪去、以便再行敲索銀錢、</p>
<p>開槍兩響慘呼身死　斯時朱見銀錢被刦、乃熟視兩匪云、予認識爾等、何相迫之急　匪等一聞此言、立呈驚慌之狀、即拔出手槍、向朱轟擊、以便滅口、一彈飛去、適中朱臀、彈即穿過、朱受創伏地、而第二彈又臨、適擊中後腦、慘呼一聲、死於血泊中、匪等見已肇血案　遂不再搜刦而去、</p>
<p>呼天搶地痛哭屍旁　迨匪去後、朱孫氏呼天搶地、在屍旁大哭、隣右聞聲趕到、因是處爲鄉間離警所甚遠、故將該氏釋縛、並往報告衣十二圖地保徐家彬趕到察看後　代爲陳報該管警署、立派幹警搜捕　匪已去遠、乃問明盜匪形式口音以憑緝究</p>
<p>法院相驗通緝兇盜　昨日上午、由該地保徐家彬具狀投地方法院報騐、下午　由劉檢察官偕宣檢騐員等蒞塲、騐明已死朱小毛　委係生前槍傷身死、諭令屍屬收殮、候分函各機關通緝凶盜、務獲解究、</p>

<p>蛇之種類。千奇百怪。不可以數計。顧皆產於南方濕熱之區。其在吾蘇屬。則殊簡單。爲鄉人所恒見而能道其名者。祇青梢赤練土虺三種而已。赤練土虺均胎生。有大毒。而以土虺爲尤甚。被噬者。治不得法。輙有性命之危。青梢則爲卵生。有毒甚微。始被噬。固亦紅腫而疼痛。但翌日即已。不至爲禍也。此蛇有好居人家屋内之特性。若地板之下。墻壁之間。瓦楞之下。胥可據爲窟宅。因身有障庇。不與風日雨露相接觸。其青色之外表。至漸變爲暗淡之灰白色。又因與人習處。失其畏怯之本性。往往泰然呈現於人前　鄉人見之。咸名之爲看宅蛇。以善意祝之使隱。不敢擊殺。謂殺之必罹大禍。蓋亦迷信使然耳。</p>
<p>曩年余家拆除一久廢之舊竈。於竈腹中得蛇卵十餘枚。蛇已孵化而去。祇剩卵壳。而其壳之質。與尋常鷄鴨等卵不同。柔軟而勒。大似蠶繭。且亦以細絲組合而成。但較爲粗鬆耳。最奇者。十餘卵竟天然連綴。成爲一串。每一卵與卵之間。各距離二三分。有大等荻莖之管。綴於其間。管中空。與卵通。質亦與卵壳同。察其全體。皆天衣無縫。惟最前一卵之頂端。破一小孔。意者。十餘小蛇之脫卵。均由此孔而出。管則爲其過道。卵形如是奇特。亦生物中之特殊者矣。</p>
<p>邇來服務於輪船公會。長夜無聊。輙與茶役丙昌作漫談。丙昌南通人。據謂其鄉有農人某甲者。晨起如厠。見厠旁有物蠕蠕動。注視之。審爲蛇。前身已入墻隙。僅露其尾。長可尺許。甲疾握而拔之。不能動。更一着力。竟𥒐然而斷。甲擲其尾。入語家人。轉輾聞於隣翁。即走謂甲曰。斷蛇在尾部三節之上。當時雖能逃去。不久必死。倘在三節之下。則猶能活。且其毒十倍常蛇。而知報仇。今姑往觀之。甲乃示以蛇尾。翁曰。噫。祇二節耳。必不至死。此後君宜備之。甲聞言惴惴。恒自戒備。如是四五年。竟無所觀。其心稍安。一夜。方就寢。緊壓其帳於被下。亦備蛇也。詎帳頂裂一微縫。蛇竟自其裂縫。竄身欲下。全身已過。而斷處已成一肉球。不能穿過。遂至進退惟谷。竭力擺動。甲爲驚醒。察知爲蛇。戒備以待。久而不下。出視帳頂之外。見其肉球。乃知蛇已無能爲。乘其懸空而死。蓋蛇之行動。僅能前進。不能後退也。</p>

<p>建設委員會副委員長曾養甫。與中央陸軍敎導隊籌備處處長馮軼裴令</p>
<p>妹曉雲女士。於二十二日下午四時假首都砲標勵志社大禮堂。舉行結婚典禮。頗極一時之盛。茲攝其有趣者。錄之如後。　　布置之完善　事前即由雙方指派負責人員。前往勵志社布置一切。禮堂四週。滿懸喜幛對聯。台上設禮案。並密置花籃。堂之外部亦綵布紛披。鮮艶奪目。他若新人休息室。來賓休息室等。無一不備。或曰。新郎爲建設委員會副委員長。此番布置。僅建設之一最小部分。將來雙方合作。建設之成績。必大有可觀。聞者莫不拊掌。</p>
<p>有趣之祝辭　禮物中以幛爲最多。約數百軸。額皆迂腐。惟玉柏齡。建設之階四字較貼切。其中以陳果夫之祝辭爲最有趣。茲錄如下。﹁建設是難事。娶妻則更難。養甫有今日。計定十年前。曾託我做媒。四處尋訪不易配。限我蘇湖女。體質大小又相背。性情温厚容顏好。品學要高尚。心中愜意條件合。安有佳人配此郎。今日託朋友。明朝自訪求。從天津。訪到美。自美洲。又回頭。廣州數月更無有。南京上海白奔走。從軍北伐又落空。平津歸來徒嘆息。蹉跎日月又一年。無奈媒人皆不力。肝火旺。病胃腸。呻吟床榻上。醫勸早成家。請命老母。商諸友人。加倍努力。達到今日的婚姻。原來馮女曉雲才能相稱。與養甫一樣多情。相見恨太晚。有志事竟成。相敬相愛。講不到什麽條文。說定就定。不必問上帝允不允。愛情原是電氣的吸引。結婚是爲了建設新家庭。新家庭。初造成。應從儉德樹模範。相信人爲是萬能。大家共晋一杯酒。恭祝一雙幸福人。﹂語極滑稽有趣。爲祝辭中之别開生面者。張我華之聯爲﹁金卜同心。好趁春風締鴛牒。社能勵志。雅宜戒旦及鷄鳴。﹂本地風光。亦含雅趣。戴季陶之雙喜字。寫於蟠龍紙上。飾以金邊之鏡框。實爲特色。</p>
<p>稚老之針辭　吳稚老與張靜江同爲證婚人。由稚老致箴辭。大意謂養甫同志奔走革命有年。近復努力建設事業。聞養甫新夫婦將乘蜜月之假。赴美考察建設事工。可賀可賀。並望努力家庭之建設。瓜瓞綿綿云。</p>
<p>處長之窘態　馮軼裴着軍服。佩寳鼎章。伴其妹入禮堂。琴音小步。馮不慣。大現窘態。蓋馮固曾任二十二路總指揮。平日指揮將士。活潑而有勇氣。今驟以此拘之。無怪面紅耳赤。而觀禮者且呼﹁處長窘矣。﹂致馮益侷促不安也。</p>

<p>畹華赴美之先。多有爲之擔憂者。惟余知美人之迎拒。全視宣傳之得力與否。若由美人爲之竭力鼓吹。則諸般困難。悉可迎刄而解矣。今也果然。友人有自紐約寄來關於梅君消息一巨束。其中長篇巨著。琳瑯滿目。美不勝收。諸報爲紐約晚郵。紐約泰晤士。紐約太陽。及紐約公論報諸種。特不憚煩。節譯此文。以饜讀者。諒不僅熱心戲劇者。有先覩之快。即關心國事者。對於外人評論中國藝術之優良。亦必色然以喜也。</p>
<p>紐约晚郵報記者佘爾温氏著一長文。茲特節要譯之如下。（以下爲論文之大略）</p>
<p>若以昨夕觀衆在四十九街戲院之踴躍鼓舞之神情測之。則吾料紐約全城。不久必將爲對於中國人民中國物事之狂熱所沉淪矣。故吾敢質吾所有。斷言昔日紐約之最好奇者。將放棄其黑人夜宫之生活。轉而崇拜東方藝術。同時亦必有多數半生不熟的。矯揉造作的。自命不凡的中國學者。出現於旅舍飯店之大廳上也。</p>
<p>此又可證明戲院内之宣傳。若有得法之程序。將爲國際間最可驚人之一種宣傳。</p>
<p>觀夫美國中國社之延請梅君來此。不尤可信乎。吾又知不出一星期之内。紐約之人必將有言必言中國之人。有言必言中國之物。引起吾人對中國人之同情。至不可思議之度數也。此種狂熱前已數次吹蔽全城。西班牙人一時。黑人又一時。今則中國人之一時代也。</p>

<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>安特萊竇朗ＡndreＤerain（二）</p>
<p>從歐戰結束以後起他常在盧佛宫研究曩日諸大師的作品。對於他們的熱烈的畫面。他漸漸喜歡雷諾亞Ｒenoir的正確的格局或哥羅Ｃorot的抒情天才。而可羅的其他一切也都受他的贊賞。所謂一切詩意。感覺。清新。以及方法的穩健。惟是全部盧佛宫對於竇朗。都十分親熱。霞丹Ｃbardint和他的靜物。洛郎ＣlaudeＬorrain和他的樹木。吕班士Ｒubens的粗獷。高爾佩Ｃourbet和馬奈Ｍanet的富於情趣的白色。光明的精神和一切的耀目的奇幻。一切人爲的﹁光暗﹂。一切勇敢而高尚的亞剌伯風。用獨斷的方法所分類的這種富源。使也得以從中重行找出客觀的世界。雷諾亞的肉感顫動的女人。背景配置的華麗。風景的生動。顏色的艶媚。總之那用高貴的源泉抒寫生命的力量。他的椶紅和碧緑的調色板給予一些可以抹畫的油汁。就將他那精細的背景。華麗的前景顯示出不滅的痕跡了。這是一切媚韻的綜合。他隨筆流露出來。使他的藝術如是令人同情。</p>
<p>竇倫是一個淹博的人物。他所實用的論理的大體上竟可說是Ｅboterique（秘傳的）。歷來大師的繪畫在於他的目光中。全是不可解說的秘密。其實在他的觀照所謂藝術不過是﹁大﹂的﹁力﹂的神秘而已。他的好奇心時時躍躍欲動。繼續他激昻的探討。那只在他的作品中滑稽地尋求他模擬大師的畫跡的某種人。就將譏笑他輕視他。他是仍然有不少的人爲他畫布上的誘人的嚴肅所感動。對於他表示非常的敬意。竇朗因爲他的多方面的才具和特點。同時是一個神秘者。一個肉感者。一個精鍊的知識階級。他對於人類的一切知識。無對於一些最是糢糊不明的困難問題。他都是喜歡去討論的。我很少看見一位畫家於知識的饕餮如他之甚。無論詩。音樂没有一樣不是他欲一口平吞的。而關於繪畫的一切哲學。尤使他溺愛不倦。</p>
<p>關於這一點。我們最好引他和勃雷噸ＡndreＢreton的談話來證明。這段談話是刋在﹁一個畫家的理想﹂（Ｉdeesdun　peintre）之中的。</p>
<p>一人們應該親切地懂得自已所畫的東西的内心。爲形而畫形是毫無意義可言的。當我和一個人談話那時。我何嘗知道這人是怎樣的一種形呢。我所留意的只是他的五官對我所發生的表情。只有這個能給我以生命的印象。一個人的殊異固然是存在的。—聽得不大清楚的人們。無論他的耳盤如何大法。也是徒然。—繪畫是不能專求形似的。形體是當由修積方面來表現的。在五官以外是没有什麽可以探尋的東西。就是對於動物和植物仍得用這同一的規律。樹木的生命是一種神秘。不透入他的内心是没有一個畫家可以成功的。或者只有盧梭ＨenriＲousseau對此曾經擔心過。但是他還太看重葉片以致損害全體。我們常見市塲裏有人出賣一種鐵線的迷套把戲。令人從這迷套中解脫一個環子。這正和一株樹的生命問題相同。—能夠捉住樹的生命的人。才是成功的畫家。—無論無生物的生命的問題也是相同。誰能以爲可以捉得住一件物質的﹁運動﹂呢。（不動等於絶對的運動）。所有落在我的官能之前的對於我都有牠的用處。其不完全受我採用的。定是穉弱與虛假····</p>

<p>— 光楣</p>
<p>美麗的春之神、含着微笑、帶了無其數的神仙、欣然地降到人間和我們相見了、休說人們無一個不在欣幸鼓舞地歡迎着、就是多情的鳥兒、可愛的花木、又何嘗不在拚命地鼓弄着她那如簧似絃的巧舌、爭吐她那如畫似繡的葉蕊、茸茸的芳草、毫不吝情地、把茫茫的大地、織成了悅目的緑毯、大千世界、一變而爲錦繡山河、呵、誰之賜、誰之與、我們怎能不感謝春之神賞賜給我們－萬物以無限的生命、</p>
<p>春光照例地散佈在江灣路上、這裏有耐人尋味的虹口公園、六三花園和游泳池等等、但我們應該明白的這些這些、無不我們貴同胞自已手造的、完全是承蒙洋大人的賜與、每當我們享受到這些現成福分時、我們便會想到所謂﹁公園﹂者、僅不過是公其所公、可憐一班窮苦的同胞那裏可以嘗到﹁公﹂字竟究是什麽口味、雖然逛得起公園者並不都就富有的人、但畢竟腰裏没有兩個毛子時就不得其門而入、無論你有多大面子、</p>
<p>何若早晨八點鐘没有課時、高興到像跳舞廳一樣柔滑的江灣路上去探一探春的消息、包你可以看見三三五五的異族小朋友、背着書包、花也似的美麗、雀也似的活潑、﹁嘰哩咕嚕﹂地從你面前跳過　直至轉了灣　目不能及才止、接着的就是足足六七十人之多的賽跑隊　踝着身子、不、僅僅一件游泳衣似的小衣服、充滿着春的朝氣、勇猛地向前奔去　第一遭光顧到的我、阿木林兮兮的在思想着、這一羣健兒不知是那個學校裏的、哦、或者說不定是持志裏的、時光不容我想下去、他們已飛也似的由我面前馳過　原來是碧眼黄髮先生們、呵、他們的身子、確實稱得充滿了﹁力﹂與﹁美﹂、並不過甚其辭地說一句、他們那胸部的發達、却比我們處女的還要利害、當時我又不恭敬地生出一種嫉視他們的感想、不時地又可現入你眼簾的　就是與我們刎頸莫逆的木屐朋友、他們和她們領着若干若的小</p>

<p>太陽變成了紅臉、將開始和我們握手說一聲﹁明天會﹂、月姊畢竟還帶點處女氣味　隻身藏在薄幕裏、澹澹的清風吹在身上不寒而温、這時候　這美麗時候、正是我們課餘飯飽出而散步的一刻千金、這時的江灣路上、却充滿了芬芳的氤氲、碧眼黄髮的先生們、木屐﹁托托﹂的朋友們、和法學院與持志的同學們、大家其樂融融地在徘徊着　或是到公園裏去散散步、有愛人的、當然老實不客地雙雙并着肩、一面揚笑、一面私語、傲傲乎自若渺視一切之概、没有愛人的　就是同性的朋友、起碼限度也得三五成羣、單獨的似乎難以見到、假使你獨個人在公園裏散步時、總不愁没有一個或一個以上的洋裝衣架子、前後追逐着　使得何心裏起了一百二十分的不快感、前天、我將我在公園裏所遇的情景憤恨的對鴻講出、那知非但不得到她的同情、反而這樣說﹁誰叫你生得趣、像我這樣、保不會有人來釘、﹂哈哈、眞天曉得、當去年今日、我和淑各着件青布罩衫、什麽脂粉都没用、還不是一樣的遇着這些傢伙、煞是可惱、</p>
<p>天色漸漸地垂暮了、我們不期然便向校裏步去、這時迎面而來的便是大羣的將下工的繅絲阿姊、她們各提着了食簍、也就是使人一望而知的唯一記號、我很欽佩她們、欽佩她們能這樣吃苦耐勞呵、勞工神聖的繅絲阿姊、</p>
<p>總之、一切一切、决不如此簡單、只要你有工夫去走一遭、這裏所記的僅是我們春的生活之一班、我想住在車水馬龍的衖堂裏的學校裏同學們、想像到我們這種學校生活時、說不定還要艶羨得垂涎不禁罷（光楣）</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e7">The Outcome of the Tariff Truce Conference <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Currently, there are two major global movements. One is the Five-Power Naval Conference to limit armaments, and the other is the Tariff Truce Conference in Europe to halt tax increases. The significance of a tariff truce is the same as preventing future wars in military affairs, which is greatly related to the welfare of the world's people. However, both support for and opposition to these movements must be based on the interests of one's own country as a premise. Countries with well-established industrial and commercial organizations, aiming only to achieve free trade, have different situations than those requiring a protective tariff system. Furthermore, one must observe the state of the global economy. Even without the ambition to compete abroad, one must still guard against the pressure from external forces and the environment. Therefore, for the sake of European economic cooperation, there is no opposition to halting tax increases. However, upon further examination of the interests of each country, it is difficult to achieve consensus, just as in the Naval Conference, for the sake of hoping for peace, there is universal sympathy for reducing armaments. Yet, upon further examination of the international situation and research into one's own interests, everyone is hesitant to move forward and dare not strongly agree. The situation is quite similar. Currently, the Naval Conference is still at a standstill, with little hope for the future. Although the Tariff Truce Conference has held its final meeting and achieved some results, maintaining existing commercial treaties will only be effective for one year. Moreover, not all participating countries have signed the agreement. The German representative's parting words stated that the results of this conference failed to meet the expectations of the public, but that economic understanding among the powers has moved one step closer as a result. He stated its effect was only this much, indicating the difficulty of achieving the goal.</p>
<p>Beyond Europe, I will observe the economic situation of various countries. India is currently undergoing a third reading of new tariff rules, with increases in taxes on items such as cotton cloth, sugar, and kerosene. The new US tariff rules, although passed by the Senate, are likely to become a focal point of contention due to significant differences with the House of Representatives' proposals. This also serves as further evidence that halting tax increases is not easy to implement. In terms of financial common sense, whether or not to increase taxes must be weighed against the level of national expenditures. Those with sufficient revenue to cover expenditures have no need to increase taxes. Those with insufficient revenue must resort to increasing taxes. The main reason for insufficient revenue is military spending. Let us examine the new budgets of the UK and Japan. The UK's new budget allocates 40 million pounds for the army, equivalent to approximately 600 million silver dollars. Left-wing Labor MPs proposed an amendment demanding a large annual reduction, but it was rejected. Expenditure on aviation is 16.96 million pounds, an increase of 890,000 pounds compared to last year. Japan's new budget allocates 210 million yuan for the army and 262 million yuan for the navy, which cannot be greatly reduced either. The reason is that the success or failure of the London Conference is still uncertain, and the amount of national defense spending is difficult to determine. All are unwilling to easily discuss reductions. Since military spending cannot be easily reduced, the budget is likely to be insufficient, which means that the proposal to halt tax increases is unlikely to be easily approved. Therefore, I believe that the difficulty of achieving these two major movements is also related.</p>

<p>Shigemitsu葵 Requests Conversion to a Special Treaty</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shigemitsu葵 arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 26th. At 2:30 PM, he visited Sun Ke at his private residence with Hayashi 出 and others to discuss the issue of land rights in the Sino-Japanese treaty revision. The discussion lasted for one hour. He then went to Sajiawan to meet with Wang Zhengting. It is reported that the Chinese and Japanese versions of the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement are undergoing precise corrections in terms of wording. After approval by both governments, they will be formally signed. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that when Shigemitsu葵 met with Wang Zhengting on the 26th, he requested that the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement be converted into a special treaty, regardless of when the new Sino-Japanese treaty is established, and that it not be subject to its restrictions. Wang agreed to consider it. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Fudan News Agency, the issue of Chinese jurisdiction was not mentioned during the meeting between Wang and Shigemitsu on the 26th because the Japanese government had instructed Shigemitsu that the issue of jurisdiction should be discussed after the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement is formally signed. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shigemitsu told reporters from the Central News Agency that Sino-Japanese jurisdiction must wait until the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement is formally signed before negotiations can begin. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The student unrest at the Huangpu Military Academy during the period of military tension, caused by the issue of the Director of Education's departure, has attracted considerable attention. I recently met with Lin Zhenxiong, the Director of Education of the school, in Nanjing. According to him, the school has long occupied an important position in military affairs in Guangdong Province. Unexpectedly, a few elements in the Political Training Department, influenced by reactionaries and harboring different ideas, often surrounded and attacked him on school affairs, attempting to use him as a reactionary tool and engaging in various forms of counter-propaganda to fundamentally shake the Huangpu School, which has always been a revolutionary armed force. Therefore, he left the school early to come to Nanjing to report everything to Principal Chiang and to request resignation. The school has repeatedly telegraphed urging his return, but due to the difficulty of handling affairs, he has remained for a long time. He has now heard that all the students, with a major enemy at hand, should unite in spirit and strive hard. However, they are conspiring to sabotage, giving the enemy an opportunity to incite, which seriously endangers the foundation of the revolution. They had no choice but to resolve it with collective force. He plans to wait for Principal Chiang to return to Nanjing to ask for instructions on everything. If he is ordered to return to the school, he will go to reorganize it. The occurrence of this incident is actually a collective action to safeguard the school's position. To say that it is a simple issue of personal departure is not understanding the truth. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

We must avoid certain abstract theories that are inconsistent with the truth. The equality demanded by some country will contradict fairness and ultimately be interpreted as unjust. France is determined to conclude an agreement that benefits all parties. The talks have not been closed, and when the time is right, the issue will be raised again when there is a greater possibility of resolving it." The French Foreign Minister explained the French government's attitude, saying that in seeking true peace, France's great sacrifices are known to all. What France requests in London is nothing more than the security that each country can obtain in accordance with the charter of the League of Nations. If all countries do not submit their disputes to arbitration, there is still an urgent need for mutual security guarantees. France cannot sacrifice its vital national interests for international considerations. France's naval program has absolutely no aggressive intent, but because its colonies are scattered in all directions, it must have this for defense. The Senate later passed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' budget and, due to the Foreign Minister's statement, rejected the motion to sever Franco-Russian diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>The United States Declares it Does Not Wish to Join the Alliance Treaty</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 26th: Due to rumors from the outside that the United States has changed its attitude towards European alliance treaties and is now willing to join the alliance treaty in order to preserve the Naval Conference, the American delegation issued a formal statement tonight, declaring that its attitude has not changed. It stated that the United States does not object to participating in conventions of a consultative nature, but the United States does not wish to join any contract that carries the danger of its obligations being mistakenly regarded as promises of military assistance to other countries or assuming responsibility for providing military protection. If the United States joined this type of contract, in exchange for other countries' disarmament, the above-mentioned misunderstandings would inevitably occur. Ever since France demanded mutual military guarantees as a condition for disarmament, the situation has been fraught with this danger. However, if the demands for guarantees can be satisfied in other ways, then conventions of a consultative nature may be free of the danger of misunderstandings, and this issue can be discussed on a completely different footing. The American representatives can then consider this matter with a completely open mind.</p>
<p>Deliberation on the Issue of Disposal of Discarded Warships</p>
<p>Japan News Agency dispatch from London on the 25th: Today, the disarmament conference's special committee deliberated on the draft plan for the disposal of discarded warships prepared by the sub-committee, but no decision was reached and deliberations will continue tomorrow. The new draft plan stipulates the following five methods for the disposal of discarded warships: (1) disposal; (2) conversion into floating docks; (3) use as target ships for live firing practice; (4) use for testing; (5) use for training.</p>
<p>British Establish Sky Budget</p>
<p>An Increase of 890,000 Pounds Compared to Last Year</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 25th: The British House of Commons today established the sky budget, with total sky expenditures for 1930 amounting to £17,850,000. The revised budget for 1929, including an additional £760,000, totaled £16,960,000. Therefore, this year's budget is £890,000 higher than last year's.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 25th: Undersecretary of the Air Ministry Montague, while answering questions from members of parliament during a debate on the sky budget in the House of Commons today, said that the airfields in India are not yet ready for commercial aviation use. Therefore, the Indian government and the British government not only oppose the use of these airfields by Dutch planes flying to the Dutch East Indies but also oppose their use by British planes.</p>
<p>The League of Nations Convenes a Meeting to Discuss the Wheat Problem</p>
<p>Recommending Four Measures to Countries</p>
<p>The German Parliament Passes a New Grain Tariff</p>
<p>The World News Agency reports that since the global wheat price plummeted, the United States first promulgated the Agricultural Relief Act. The Department of Agriculture encourages farmers to reduce planting. If farmers are expected to increase spring wheat planting, warnings will be issued. On the one hand, European countries in need of wheat are also importing cheap wheat from the United States and Canada, causing the market price to collapse. To help domestic farmers, each country has increased wheat tariffs. For example, Germany and France have allocated funds to encourage exports, and Spain has also prohibited the import of foreign wheat. Therefore, the League of Nations also attaches great importance to the farmer problem. Recently, it invited twenty-four representatives from major wheat-producing countries that have joined the League of Nations, such as England, France, and Belgium, to study response measures. It invited world experts to the League of Nations to solve the wheat problem internationally, using this as a starting point. As a result of the meeting, it recommended the following four items to each country: (1) Wheat-producing countries should rationalize production methods, establish joint allocation organizations among producers, and encourage those who have withdrawn to unite. (2) Because wheat is the primary reason for fundamental agricultural problems, in order to solve the economic difficulties caused by the increase in planting, statistical surveys should be conducted. (3) Due to overproduction of wheat and falling prices, in order to stabilize prices, governments should be urged to find ways to control production volume and export volume. (4) Especially in consumer countries such as the UK, France, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands, and Ireland, where per capita consumption is declining, efforts should be made to increase wheat consumption.</p>
<p>National News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 25th: The German Parliament has passed the new grain tariff with an overwhelming majority in order to alleviate farmers' fears. In recent years, more and more Germans have switched to eating white wheat bread, causing foreign wheat to be imported in large quantities, while the domestic rye, which had a bumper harvest last year, rotted in granaries and was ignored. Therefore, the wheat tax stipulated in the bill will fluctuate with the world wheat price, ranging from one mark to six marks per 112 pounds. Even if the world wheat price falls 40% below the current price in the future, there will be separate regulations. In addition, the taxes on barley, potatoes, and cane sugar have also been greatly increased. A special monopoly system will be established for both domestically produced and imported corn, with a tax of 1.25 marks per 112 pounds.</p>

<p>Chairman Xu of the National Relief Committee, Chinese Jinshenghui, Renji Shanzang, Shen Bao, News Report Office, please acknowledge: Our county, Liyang, Anhui Langxi, suffered from banditry and warfare the year before last, followed by a year of famine, and the people cannot bear it. In addition, this year's drought and insect pests resulted in no harvest. We telegraphed the provincial government to urgently provide relief and waive taxes, and the province replied that your association would send personnel to Liyang to provide relief, etc. We have been waiting anxiously, but you have not arrived. Local relief efforts in the depths of winter are insufficient to meet even one-ten-thousandth of the need. Rain and snow have continued, and vegetables and wheat have been frozen to death, making the spring harvest even more hopeless. Many of the 200,000 people are starving to death. Soon, we will lack the funds to buy seeds, making the autumn harvest even more difficult. We beg you to send personnel to the countryside to release spring relief. Time is of the essence. We rely on your prayers. In addition to sending Chen Pai, Wu Liutang, and Wang Feiqing to present a letter and plead in person, we hereby send this telegram in advance. County Government, Chamber of Commerce, Education Association, Farmers' Association, Relief Institute, all kowtow with seals.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Central Political Conference <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The 220th Meeting</p>
<p>The Central Political Conference held its 220th meeting today (the 26th) at 8:00 AM. The attending committee members were Wang Chonghui, Hu Hanmin, Gu Yingfen, Chen Guofu, Yu Youren, Tan Yankai, Sun Ke, and He Yingqin. The committee members in attendance were Shao Yuanchong, Li Wenfan, Kong Xiangxi, Wang Zhengting, and Liu Jiwen. Chairman Tan Yankai presided over the meeting, and the following matters were discussed: (1) Committee members Hu Hanmin and Lin Sen proposed that, since the first book of the Civil Code, General Principles, the second book, Obligations, and the third book, Property Rights, have all been promulgated by the government in sequence, the fourth book, Family, and the fifth book, Inheritance, urgently need to be drafted to facilitate their application. However, the two books on Family and Inheritance are closely related to the party's platform and local customs. Without careful consideration, we fear that there will be many conflicts. We propose that the principles be formulated first by this conference and sent to the Legislative Yuan for drafting in accordance with these principles. Here are the most controversial points in the legislative doctrine for your preliminary decision, so that there is something to refer to when formulating the principles. The decision was handed over to the legal team for review. (2) The Political Report Group reported that the case of "Standards for the Application of the Committee System" submitted by the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee for deliberation was considered to be at a time when political organization methods had just been re-established at the beginning of the Political Tutelage, and it was appropriate to give it time and wait for it to proceed in an orderly manner. After that, the actual situation should be examined to see if there are any shortcomings, and then choose what is needed and discard what is not. It seems that this case does not need to be discussed for the time being. Whether this is appropriate or not is still waiting for the public decision. The decision was passed according to the review opinions.</p>
<h3 id="e58">After Chairman Chiang Returns to Fenghua Hometown <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: Chairman Chiang has been back in his hometown for three days. Yesterday (the 24th) was the Memorial Week for the Premier. After getting up at 8:00 AM, Chairman Chiang went to Wuling Elementary School to participate in the expanded Memorial Week. Chairman Chiang himself presided over the event and encouraged the students. After the ceremony ended at 8:00 AM, he went to visit relatives and friends with Madame Soong Mei-ling. He did not return to his residence in Xikou until 5:00 PM. Upon learning that Chairman Zhang Jingjiang and Provincial Committee members Zhu Jiahua and Chen Bulei had arrived in Xikou, he ordered a banquet to be held at his residence to welcome Zhang and others. After Zhang and others arrived in Hankou, they first stayed at Wuling Elementary School. Upon learning that Chairman Chiang had returned to his residence, they sent their visiting cards. They were very happy to see each other. The banquet started at 7:00 PM, with Zhou, the Salt Transport Envoy, Chiang the Supervisor, Commander Wang, Mayor Yang, and others accompanying them. The banquet ended happily at 8:00 PM. Zhang and others returned to the reception center at Wuling Elementary School to rest. Chiang had already prepared offerings and planned to go to Yulin Ao to sweep the tombs at 8:00 AM today (the 25th).</p>
<p>According to Chairman Zhang, the provincial government officials came to visit Chiang in Fenghua in a group. This time they came to visit Chiang, without major official business, but took the opportunity to visit Xikou and Xuedou Temple scenic spots, and inspect the Yin Feng Provincial Road. Chairman Zhang plans to visit the Xuedou Temple, Miaogao Terrace, Qianzhang Rock and other scenic spots with Zhu Jiahua, Chen Bulei, and Shen Shiyuan, provincial committee members, today morning. Zhang cannot stay in Feng for long. It is heard that he will return to Hangzhou along the original road this afternoon, and will still not have time to stop in Yong.</p>
<p>The Yinxian County Party Department believes that it has been four days since Chairman Chiang returned to his hometown to sweep the tombs, and the reactionary forces are becoming increasingly rampant. Everything depends on the Chairman, and it is necessary to urge him to return to the capital immediately. Therefore, the Party Department sent members to Feng yesterday afternoon to visit Chairman Chiang and personally express their intention to urge him to return to the capital. However, Chairman Chiang's actions are often decided on the spot, and it is still unknown on which day he will return to the capital and by what route. (March 25)</p>
<h3 id="e59">The Fujian Situation Regarding the Arrival of Liu's Division in the Province <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The 56th Division of Liu Heding's troops, the Liu Shangzhi and Gui Zhenyuan brigades, are taking the route from Putian Xianyou through Fuqing Yongtai to the province. Chen Jiliang telegraphed to stop them, and then received a reply from Liu Heding, saying that this time he was going to the province by order of the headquarters, and the urging was very urgent, and it would be difficult to stop until the order to stop advancing was received. Now Liu's division is still advancing in separate ways. According to the estimated itinerary, the troops from Fuqing will arrive at Qiaonan, outside the South Gate of the provincial capital, as early as tonight, and no later than tomorrow. The troops from Yongtai will arrive at Hongshan, outside the West Gate of the provincial capital. Liu Heding himself also led the special service battalion from Quanzhou to Xinghua. His office in the province ordered the Minhou County Government yesterday morning to rush to prepare 100 porters, 60,000 catties of rice straw, 500 bamboo beds, and 300 chair strips for use. In the afternoon, he hosted a banquet for reporters at the Xihu Linzhuang office, explaining the circumstances of the division's orders to come to the province this time, and asked the newspapers to record it carefully to avoid social misunderstanding. Last night, Chen Jiliang gathered Chen Gang, director of Liu's office in the province, Yang Yugu, Lushi's senator, and naval generals Lin Zhong and Sa Fuchou at the Zhongzhou Naval Office to discuss. As a result of the discussion, Chen Jiliang telegraphed Chen Shaokuan, asking him to transfer the message to the central government, and quickly ordered Liu's division to remain in Quanzhou's original defense and not come to the province, so that the disputes in Fujian could be resolved as soon as possible. On the one hand, he asked Chen Gang to telegraph Division Commander Liu, and to temporarily station in Fuqing Yongtai to await orders before receiving the headquarters' order to stop advancing. After Chen Naiyuan and the other six people were escorted to the province, Chen Jiliang advocated that they be sent to Beijing immediately and asked the central government to handle it. Lu Xingbang advocated waiting for the provincial government to be reorganized before sending them to Beijing, so a decision has not yet been made. However, Chen Naiyuan and others were moved from the old Huangdian arsenal to the nearby Huangshan YMCA summer camp a few days ago. Yesterday, upon hearing that Liu's division was about to enter the province, Lu's troops sent two battalions of troops from Yanping to the province, which, together with the original battalion, formed a regiment, with two battalions stationed at the Huangdian arsenal and one battalion stationed at the Huangshan YMCA, to protect Chen Naiyuan and others. Two steamships were moored on the river below the mountain, ready to depart, and it was heard that Chen and the other six would be sent to Youxi if necessary. The Fujian situation, which had become more moderate, is now suddenly showing signs of tension again.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Problems with Yongding River Works Funds <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Hebei Provincial Government Decides to Borrow from Various Counties</p>
<p>The Yongding and Daqing Rivers in Imminent Danger</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Now is the season for spring floods. The Yongding River embankment closure project cannot be delayed any longer. According to news from the Department of Construction, since the ice melted, not only have dangerous sections appeared repeatedly on both the north and south banks of the Yongding River, but the Daqing River has also experienced continuous rises in water levels due to the Yongding River's floodwaters. If the breaches in the Yongding River are not closed and repaired, both rivers face the risk of unexpected disasters once storms arrive. The members of the Hebei Provincial Government believe that at this critical juncture, if the province does not find a way to borrow funds for construction, the opportunity will be missed once the major flood season arrives. Therefore, at yesterday's committee meeting, Chairman Xu Yongchang and Finance Director Li Hongwen proposed that 600,000 to 700,000 yuan be temporarily borrowed from various counties to meet emergency needs. This loan will be guaranteed by the 1,000,000 yuan from the price increase of Changlu salt, to be repaid in six months with a monthly interest rate of one percent. This was decided and approved. It was also decided that the Department of Finance would immediately allocate the amount to be borrowed to each county and demand prompt payment. Regarding the various construction projects, the Department of Construction, together with the Yongding River Breach Closure Engineering Office, will actively proceed with the work, aiming to complete all projects before the major flood season. The reports received by the Department of Construction from the Yongding and Daqing Rivers Affairs Bureau are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram 1: To Wen Jun, Director of the Department of Construction of the Hebei Provincial Government: On March 18th, at Shen time (3-5 PM), the chief of the second section of the southern riverbank, Hu Deji, reported that at Wei time (1-3 PM) today, the second earth dam of the twelfth section of the southern second section was being directly impacted by a strong current, causing severe erosion in front of the dam and collapsing 11-12 zhang (approximately 36-40 meters) of the dam's base, creating a dangerous situation. The section chief is supervising laborers, hiring large carts, and transporting official reed materials from sections 5 and 6 of this section. At the same time, 50 coils of optical cable are being transferred from the southern third section, wrapped with large oilcloth, for protection. This is hereby reported by telegram, etc. Based on this, it is found that the dangerous section is prominent and the situation is critical. An immediate telegram was sent instructing the use of reed mats tied to hang protective dyke curtains and to strengthen defenses to avoid negligence. In addition to reporting the flood prevention and rescue efforts at any time, it is also submitted to the Department of Civil Affairs. Respectfully, Feng Heming, Director of the Yongding River Affairs Bureau, bows and respectfully.</p>
<p>Telegram 2: To Director Wen of the Department of Construction: Since the ice melted, the Qing River has been continuously rising due to the Yongding River's floodwaters. Reports on the emergency rescue efforts for various dangerous sections of the river have been telegraphed to you. Recently, during an inspection to the Xin'an Town county border, it was found that the people's embankments on the north bank are thin and incomplete. The water surface is almost level with the top of the embankments, creating a very dangerous situation. With the source of water currently abundant and the current fierce, there is a risk of unexpected disasters once storms arrive. In addition to supervising the section chiefs, etc., to work with the county magistrate to urge the villagers to find ways to protect the embankment, this is hereby reported by telegram. Cao Baoshan, Director of the Daqing River Affairs Bureau, bows. (March 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e64">The Harbin Special District Investigates Foreign Residents <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Foreign Consulates in Harbin Object in Succession</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Special Police Administration recently planned to implement a general household survey throughout the territory, but the consuls stationed in Harbin misunderstood this and sent letters of objection one after another. The Japanese consul even used extraterritoriality as an excuse, and his attitude was particularly strong. The Administration has already replied separately by letter. It is currently uncertain whether the investigation can proceed smoothly. The outgoing and incoming official letters are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter from the British and American Consulates to the Special Police Administration: The American Consulate in Harbin wrote, "In reply to your letter No. 650 of the 10th of this month regarding the proposed investigation of the population of this port, this consulate also agrees with this. If you could inform this consulate of the items to be investigated, we can inquire with the American residents in Harbin and pass on the information, without the need for the police to inquire directly." In view of the above, this letter is hereby sent for your information. On the same day, a letter was also received from the British Consulate in Harbin, with similar wording.</p>
<p>Reply from the Special Police Administration: In reply to your consulate's official letter of the 13th of this month, we have learned that the investigation of the population of Chinese and foreign residents is within the authority of the police administration and is a necessary procedure to protect foreigners and maintain public order. Moreover, this investigation only inquires about the name, origin, age, and occupation of the residents, and the wording is extremely simple and the procedure is not cumbersome. The Administration has carried out this investigation for many years, and there have been few obstacles. If we were to follow your proposal, it would inevitably add more complications. We hope that your consulate will understand this, and the police of this Administration will continue to directly investigate the households of your country's citizens in order to maintain local security and enhance the friendship between the two countries. This letter is sent for your information.</p>
<p>Letter from the Japanese Consulate to the Special Police Administration: Dear Sirs, Your letter No. Zheng Zi 1850 states that your police will begin investigating the households of Japanese residents from March 15th and that this consulate will order the residents to report truthfully to your investigators. Upon receipt of this, it is found that Japanese citizens in your country should enjoy the benefits of extraterritoriality, so it is difficult to immediately agree to this request. However, this consulate will not hesitate to provide goodwill assistance with all the matters that your office plans to investigate in detail, to the extent that it does not cause any harm. This letter is sent for your information.</p>
<p>Reply from the Special Police Administration: Dear Sir, We have received your consul general's official letter and understand it. The investigation of the resident population is within the authority of the police administration, and it is different from searching for criminals. Therefore, it is not related to consular jurisdiction under the treaty. As for the benefits of extraterritoriality, according to international law, it is limited to the heads of state, diplomatic officials representing the country, and military troops and warships. Other general citizens cannot enjoy the same privileges. For the reasons mentioned above, this Administration finds it necessary to directly investigate the households of your country's citizens. We hope that your consul general will understand this in order to maintain local security and strengthen the friendship between the two countries. This reply is sent for your information.</p>

<p>Refugee Leader Detained: Yin Bohua, a patrol officer from the first district public security station in this city, has been strictly investigating for criminals and preventing bandits from hiding. Every night, he strictly checks hotels and inns. On the night of the 25th, two guests, Wu Yamin and Zhang Guobiao, were found in a certain hotel. They were dressed in luxurious clothes and claimed to be refugee leaders from Jinan, Shandong. As a result of the interrogation, the two men gave different accounts, so they were suspected and taken to the district and transferred to the county government for review. Du Cheng, the judicial officer, interrogated them today (26th). They said that there were 193 refugees living in eight boats, which were now docked at the Xinyingpan in Shanghai. They came to Songjiang with a certificate to have it stamped by various agencies. When asked whether the information was true, the official ordered them to be temporarily detained pending further investigation.</p>
<p>Guard Brigade Arrests Suspect: After the bandits who were scattered in Zhujing passed through the No. 31 and No. 34 railway bridges and entered Maohu Lake, the guard brigade stationed in Songjiang immediately sent a team to block them and strengthen the defense. However, the brigade met a suspicious person a few days ago, and the soldiers captured him. After interrogation, it was found that his name was Dong Yaoqing, also known as Lao Qi. When asked about his background, he spoke evasively. The platoon leader of the company escorted him to Songjiang and sent him to the county government for legal action.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Orders Transfer of Patrol Officer: Qin Enrong, a patrol officer from the Zhangze Public Security Station in Punan, a county under the jurisdiction of the county, was transferred to the fourth public security station in the city due to his unsuitability for the local conditions, and Jiang Shengwu, a patrol officer from the fourth district, was transferred to Zhangze patrol officer.

<p>Refugees Use Magic to Steal: On the 18th of this month, more than 20 refugees from Henan, dressed in luxurious clothes, arrived at the Anting Security Corps requesting funds. The corps issued them according to regulations and escorted them out of the border. Yesterday (26th), a villager surnamed Lu from Wapu Bridge in the village reported to the town that the refugees had disturbed his home that day, extorting silver and rice. Afterwards, it was discovered that twelve dan (approximately 1.2 tons) of white rice, a pair of silver bracelets, and several silk clothes had been stolen. No one noticed anything at the time, and it was said that they used abacus magic.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Land Tax Collection Office: The collection of land tax deeds in this county has always been handled by registrars, which has led to many malpractices. The first county administrative conference resolved to improve the situation and establish a land tax collection office. The office will have one director and one deputy director, and several clerks. They will be appointed by the Finance Bureau and approved by the county government. Gentlemen familiar with the tax collection situation will be hired as auditors. The transfer fee for tax collection will be 2 jiao (0.2 yuan) per mu (approximately 0.067 hectares) of cultivated land. The fee for residential land with a value of less than 100 yuan will be the same as cultivated land. Residential land with a value of between 100 and 500 yuan will be 1 yuan per mu. Residential land with a value of more than 500 yuan will be 3 yuan per mu. The fee for establishing a household will be 2 jiao per household. Legal agencies, groups, and schools will be exempt from collection.

<p>Record of the Trial of Zhou Shuiping's Case: The case of Zhou Shuiping was heard yesterday (the 26th) at approximately 4:00 PM at the Wu County District Court. The presiding judge was Xiao Xiebin, the Chief of the Fourth Tribunal. Prosecutor Wang Fusheng, Zhou's defense lawyer Sha Yankai, Wang Wenru's defense lawyer Xia Dingrui, and Wang Tingyi's defense lawyer Pan Cheng'e were absent. The plaintiff Zhou Zhongfu was also absent. Judge Xiao ordered a further interrogation of Wang Tingyi, Li Chengmin, and Wang Wenru. According to Wang Tingyi's testimony, in the Republic of China year 14, relatives and others drafted a document, instructing me to use my name to accuse Zhou Shuiping of organizing a Tenant Cooperative Self-Help Association and inciting villagers to resist rent. For the sake of collecting rent, I put my name and seal on it, claiming Zhou was promoting communism, distributing anti-rent leaflets, and publishing the "Starlight Newspaper," which prominently featured "Long Live the Proletariat." The leaflets stated that if farmers resisted rent and officials came to arrest them, there wouldn't be enough large prisons for millions of people, etc. However, at the time, the request to the authorities was to punish him according to the law, to stop his behavior, not to take his life. I didn't know that Zhang Chongzhi sent a telegram to Sun Chuanfang in December of the 14th, demanding strict punishment for him. Wang Wenzhi does exist; the person currently detained is Wang Wenru, etc. Next, Wang Wenru was interrogated, and he repeatedly argued that Wang Wenzhi was another person, and he had already presented various evidence, such as Qingxiang registers, family genealogy, letters, and landlords, and that things should not be misrepresented, etc. Li Chengmin stated that he did not sign the document and could have his handwriting compared. Due to an error in the original file, my original signed document can be investigated at the Jiangyin County government. The three individuals' testimonies were lengthy. After the prosecutor presented his opinion, stating the case has been investigated by the honorable judge, and requesting an immediate legal verdict. Then, lawyer Sha also presented his opinion, stating that the facts of the case revolve around four points: promoting communism, inciting the masses to resist rent, illegal assembly, and distributing leaflets. Now, based on the report from Huang Bingzhong, the captain of the detective team, on November 23 of the 14th year, drafts of the leaflets were found. Zhou Shuiping's confession on November 23 of the 14th year also admitted to some of it. This shows that the incident was not without cause and is indeed factual. Furthermore, according to Supreme Court Ruling No. 81 of the 17th year, to commit the crime of false accusation, one must knowingly fabricate facts. In this case, the facts are not fabricated, so false accusation obviously does not stand. The court is requested to declare the defendant not guilty. Next, lawyer Xia argued regarding the confusion between Wang Wenru and Wang Wenzhi, citing various sources and requesting their release. As a result, the court announced that the verdict would be scheduled for pronouncement within three to five days. Wang Tingyi and the other two were returned to custody. The court adjourned close to 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chen Zegao Suddenly Receives a Threatening Letter: Chen Zegao, a resident of Liu Jia Bang inside Xin'an Gate, received a threatening letter via mail on the morning of the 26th. The letter stated, "Our group has two or three hundred members. We have financial difficulties and need to borrow $1,000. You must deliver the money by dusk on the 27th (today) at the West Garden Road. The signal will be someone holding a flashlight in their right hand and a newspaper in their left." The letter was signed Zhao and another person. After receiving the letter, Chen immediately submitted the original to the Northern District Office and the Xin District Office, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>Suzhou Municipal Government Staff Reductions: Since its establishment, the Suzhou Municipal Government has experienced extreme financial difficulties in terms of regular and operational expenses. Therefore, to reduce expenditures, staff reductions have commenced. Currently, Mayor Lu plans to dismiss nine individuals, including councilors and secretaries, which will save $300 per month. The Jiangsu Provincial Government advocates that the Suzhou Municipal Government reduce regular expenses and increase operational expenses. The police training center established by the Municipal Public Security Bureau will be converted into a police training class.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Dismissals of Bureau Officials by Public Security Bureau: Cao Xin, the acting director of the Wu County Public Security Bureau, issued an order on the 26th dismissing eight individuals: Xie Guo'an, the head of the Fourth Branch; Li Zhenheng, the patrol officer of the Sixth Branch Station; Zheng Yuming, Zhang Zongjun, and Ma Rupeng, the staff members of the First Section; and Chen Enrong and Ma Xiheng, the staff members of the Third Section.

<p>Request to Reorganize the Relief Institute: Wang Zuhua, the chief of the Third District, previously stated that the organization of the Relief Institute still consisted of the original directors from various charitable halls. In reality, they were not integrated, which was considered ineffective. He requested a reorganization. However, due to too many important cases at the local meeting at the time, it was not discussed. Now, we understand that Wang Yi and others from various districts have continued to request a discussion, proposing six thorough measures, with the cleaning up of the original charitable assets as the first step. It is reported that the county government has approved and passed the matter to the next administrative council for further review.</p>

<p>Seven Prisoners Escape from Detention Center: The county government in this district has a detention center that houses over one hundred and eighty male and female inmates awaiting trial. Wang Jingchen, the warden, just took office on March 11th. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 26th) at around 2:00 AM, seven inmates, including the thief Li Chengguo, dug a hole in their cell to the passageway, and then dug a hole through the outer wall. Because there was a large stone, they could not get out. Then they used shoulder poles to get to the top of the outer wall, and used materials to lower themselves onto the wall, escaping the prison lane and fleeing. By the time the police officers investigated, they had already escaped without a trace. Those who escaped include three thieves: Li Chengguo, Wu Xirong, and Wang Asan, as well as four drug traffickers: Gao Hangquan, Liu Erxiazi, Zhang Chunfang, and Zhu Junfu, totaling seven people. None of them were shackled. After dawn, the police team immediately set out to track them down, but it is unknown if they will be caught. At 11:00 AM, County Magistrate Sun personally went to the facility to investigate and detained the prison guard Jiang Hailin. A report was submitted to the higher authorities, ordering a strict search.</p>
<p>Citizens Accuse District Chief Zhu: Citizens Qin Chengmo, Qian Yunzhong, Ni Fuchu, and others from the Thirteenth District (Xin'an Township) stated that since District Chief Zhu Zhengxin took office, he has not only failed to achieve any results in managing local autonomy but has also engaged in numerous acts of misconduct. Specifically, he has embezzled treasury bonds, acted in a despicable manner, shown weak ability, lacked transparency in financial matters, colluded with local bullies, and protected gambling dens. They jointly submitted a document to the county government yesterday, requesting the immediate removal and punishment of District Chief Zhu.</p>
<p>The Taihu Bandit Suppression Military Subdistrict Launches an Offensive: Hu Zuyu, the General Commander of Taihu Bandit Suppression, received a telegram from headquarters ordering him to lead troops south and launch an offensive against the lake bandits as soon as possible. He has already made appropriate defense arrangements. According to the original plan, the Taihu Lake area is divided into eastern and western bandit suppression zones. The eastern zone extends from Dongshan to Zhenze, passing through Fushan, Daxueshan, and west to the north of Wuxi Town. The western zone extends from Dongshan through Zhenze to the south of Wuxi Town. Zhong Yuan, the commander of the 30th Regiment currently stationed in Changxing and Yixing counties, is appointed as the Bandit Suppression Commander of the Western Zone. Zhao Xiguang, the commander of the 25th Regiment currently stationed in Wujiang, is appointed as the Bandit Suppression Commander of the Eastern Zone. Zou Jun's 5th Battalion, currently stationed in Wuxi, and Zhang Ting's 3rd Battalion, stationed in Suzhou, will be directly dispatched by the General Headquarters. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the chiefs of each water police zone along the lake and to the county magistrates of each county, instructing them to pay attention to gathering intelligence on the bandits and to report every three days for verification. Furthermore, Gong Guoliang, the chief of the Third Water Police Zone, noted that the residents along the lake are a mixed bag, with bandits mingling among them, dispersing as farmers and gathering as bandits. The newly arrived residents are particularly prone to wandering without fixed whereabouts, some falsely claiming to be raising ducks while secretly harboring bandits. Now that the bandit suppression operation is about to begin, strict measures should be taken. Yesterday, a special consultation was sent to the Second Water Police Zone, instructing them to conduct random checks on residents along the lake who have registered their households as farmers, in addition to any newly constructed open-air duck sheds will be demolished, and the duck farmers operating under false pretenses shall be expelled to clear the source of bandits. Simultaneously, Mao Mujun, the chief of the Second Water Police Zone, received a request from Wang, the chief of the 19th Autonomous District of Wu County, to dispatch shallow-water gunboats to be stationed permanently. However, as it is now a time for active bandit suppression, and the existing warships are still insufficient for distribution, a reply telegram has already been sent to inform them.</p>
<p>Record of Silkworm Industry Association Meeting: The Wuxi Silkworm Industry Association convened an executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon and resolved: (1) To appoint Jiang Daoshan to audit the four-column ledger of the expenditure and income of the eighteen degrees and to organize the items for printing and distribution.

<p>Urgently Build the Wanggang Embankment's Perilous Section: The Jiang'an coast near Nantong's Wanggang is experiencing severe erosion, posing an extreme danger. The Construction Bureau, recognizing that the Linchao and other villages have already suffered tidal disasters, held an emergency meeting of representatives from all sectors and decided that the county government should immediately issue a notice to solicit labor and urgently build the embankment. It is proposed to levy a donation of 3.5 li per mu of land to secure the embankment against collapse and requested the Construction Department to approve it immediately.</p>
<p>Banditry Rampant in Various Districts in Eastern Township: In recent days, gangs of bandits numbering two to three thousand have gathered in various districts in Nantong's eastern township, causing riots. The county police squad stationed there has been surrounded and has lost all ammunition. Businessmen and residents have evacuated the Siyangba area. The bandits have set up a fake command post at the Wufuqiao in Dongshe, ordering the people to hang red flags. The 15th squadron of the Provincial Police Team has arrived from the province and is rushing to Erjia Town. Commander Xiong from Songhu sent a regiment to Tong on the 25th. The bandits in the eastern township have not yet harassed the people too much. Yu Donglai, the head of the town urgently informed the Nantong emergency meeting, recounted the absurd and erroneous actions of Yan Diannan, the captain of the county police squad, and reported that he had sold guns and ammunition to the bandits. The delegates were outraged and jointly submitted a petition to the province and county, demanding a thorough investigation. Recently, the security of the city remains under the responsibility of the Marine Corps. It is reported that after the bandits seized the firearms from the county police squad, they surrounded and searched the Siyangba Public Security Bureau and the Yiyu District Office, abducting more than ten officials, including Ling Xiao, who was an assistant at the district office. Due to being hated by the bandits, Ling's limbs were cut off in public, his head was severed, and his chest was cut open, and his heart was cooked and eaten. All the other captured people were released. Ling's head is still hanging on a power pole in the town.</p>

The county government held that Guan Naiqing and others dared to bind and imprison personnel performing public duties, so Guan and others were taken into custody. Guan Nai did not accept this and appealed to the High Court of Branch, requesting a transfer of jurisdiction. The court now issued a ruling stating that the request was without reason and should be dismissed, and the original county should adjudicate according to the law.</p>

<p>Yesterday with 52 to 27</p>
<p>Defeated the Sea Monster Pittsburgh Team</p>
<p>The Chinese Basketball Team and the Sea Monster Pittsburgh team agreed to a championship tournament to compete for maritime supremacy. In the first game, China won with 47 to 40. Last night, in the second game, China won again with 52 to 27, securing the championship tournament. The third game will still be held on Saturday night of this week, but the outcome is of no consequence to the championship. The referee was Mr. Beyliss and the inspector was Mr. Le Xiurong.</p>
<p>Referee Reduces Excitement</p>
<p>The referee occupies an important position in the battle, increasing the spirit of combat on both sides and adding to the enthusiasm of the audience. This depends on strict rules and decisive decision-making. Last night, the players of both teams, especially the Pittsburgh team, had many fouls, but the referee was not experienced enough, was slow to judge, and did not enforce the rules strictly, which reduced the color of the exciting and interesting ball battle.</p>
<p>Chinese Team is Outstanding</p>
<p>Yesterday's performance of the Chinese team can be described as outstanding, even more brilliant than last time, with internal and external consistency, and good offense and defense. The Pittsburgh team paled in comparison, could not catch up, and admitted defeat.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Team Competes Vigorously</p>
<p>The Chinese team took the lead, first with a strong hand, initially taking the lead with eight to three. The Pittsburgh team changed its strategy, alternating inside and outside, and the situation quickly became a confrontation, neck and neck. Although China repeatedly took the lead and led, the Pittsburgh team followed closely, the distance between them was very small. In the first half, China was twenty-two and the Pittsburgh team was eighteen.</p>
<p>Chinese Team Works Harder</p>
<p>In the second half, the battle lines of both sides remained the same. The Pittsburgh team made a splash, adding two goals in a row, making the score 22 points apiece. The audience was alarmed. The Chinese team worked harder, bravely took the lead, and suddenly the spirit was full of energy, and the momentum was a hundredfold. From then on, it was smooth sailing, reaching the realm of success. After 26 to 23 (China took the lead), the Pittsburgh team retreated and never recovered, almost failing to be the sea monster.</p>

<p>USA Defeats Federation: 27-23</p>
<p>China Defeats Great Britain: Since the beginning of the Shanghai National Women's Basketball Championship, the Chinese team had been defeated in every match. However, at 7 PM last night, they unexpectedly defeated Great Britain by a margin of two points, with a score of 17-15. The performance of both sides was not particularly outstanding. On the Chinese team, the forwards Guo Xiaoping and Xi Jun were better players. Chen Xinyuan was slightly slow, while the defender Jiang Huaixuan showed great effort. Hua Fuji was also small but fought bravely. She Qiying had the disadvantage of focusing on the person instead of the ball. After the start of the game, Great Britain took the lead all the way, never falling behind. By the end of the first half, China suddenly took the lead with a score of 12-10. In the afternoon, Great Britain's momentum surged again, causing China to fall behind. In the last eight minutes, the Chinese women made continuous efforts and achieved remarkable results, finally defeating Great Britain with a score of 17-15.</p>
<p>First Quarter: China 4 points, Great Britain 8 points</p>

<p>USA Defeats Federation: The USA and the Federation were the most promising teams in this championship. In the past, each side had lost once. Last night's second encounter was virtually a decisive battle. In the first half, the USA showed great strength, winning with a score of 16-10. In the second half, the Federation launched a fierce counterattack, but because they were too far behind in the first half, the USA still won with a score of 27-23.

<p>Second Quarter: USA 9 points, Federation 5 points</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 4 PM, the Commercial Press of Shanghai hosted a banquet for athletes from the North and South at the China Basketball Hall, with over 200 people in attendance. During the banquet, the Commercial Press distributed various pamphlets and books as souvenirs. Huang Jingwan took the lead to stand up and speak, in a humorous and witty manner, saying, "It is a great honor to have so many athletes from the North and South here today. The colleagues of the Commercial Press sincerely welcome you. However, the refreshments are a bit simple and not very elegant." Subsequently, Wu Dongchu of the Commercial Press delivered a welcome speech, saying that failure is the mother of success, and China's sports cannot yet be compared with those of the great powers. However, seeing the vibrant spirit of everyone today is encouraging. Finally, Hao Boyang gave a speech, saying, "I just returned from overseas. What I can say about sports in foreign countries is (1) a spirit of benevolence permeates everything, not only rejoicing in the joy of others but also worrying about their worries. Whenever the other party is injured or encounters misfortune, there is a strong sense of sympathy and tenderness; (2) not taking victory as the goal, but engaging in the study of technology. After each game, the losers carefully consider the reasons for their own failure and the reasons for the other party's victory, diligently seeking to deepen their skills. The above two points are indeed good habits on foreign sports fields and also good examples for Chinese athletes. In recent years, interest in sports in our country has increased dramatically. Take football as an example. In the past, there were only five or six hundred spectators, but now there are more than ten thousand. The difference is like heaven and earth. I sincerely hope that everyone will pay more attention to the 'spirit of chivalry' in sports during this sports boom, and I wish you all smooth sailing, hoping to win championships in this National Games and strive for a place in the future Far Eastern Games, so that one day there will be Chinese athletes in the World Games." After the photo session, the guests and hosts parted happily, and the clock had already struck past 5 PM.</p>

<p>In order to actively promote education for Mongol and Tibetan people, the Ministry of Education has issued a special order to implement Mongol and Tibetan education in various leagues and banners in the provinces. It is noted that popular education is a fundamental plan for popularizing education. The Mongol and Tibetan regions are located in remote border areas, and popular education is extremely rudimentary. In order to implement popularization and develop border education, the establishment of schools for the people is an urgent matter. However, the establishment of public schools must first focus on teaching materials. The situation in Mongolia and Tibet is special, and the teaching materials adopted should be based on local conditions and the people's lives and customs as the standard. The Ministry is now planning to compile popular reading materials and urgently needs to collect various popular reading materials related to folk customs and habits, such as songs and legends, for reference. In addition to separate orders, an order is hereby given to the banner to quickly collect all kinds of popular reading materials from the people, both in Chinese and Mongolian, for submission to the ministry for review. This is extremely important. This order.</p>

<p>Around 4 p.m. yesterday afternoon, the Commercial Press hosted a banquet at the Chinese Basketball Stadium for athletes from the North and South, with over 200 people in attendance. The Commercial Press also distributed small books and other materials to commemorate the event. Huang Jingwan first stood up to speak in a grave, yet comic, tone and said: "We are honored to have so many athletes from the North and South here today. On behalf of all of my colleagues here at the Commercial Press, I'd like to extend a heartfelt welcome. However, the refreshments are meager." Following this, Wu Dongchu from the Commercial Press gave a welcome speech, saying that failure is the mother of success. China's sporting achievements are still not yet able to compete with the world powers; however, seeing these athletes here today is very promising. Finally, Hao Boyang delivered a speech saying, "I have recently returned from overseas, and there are a few things to be said about sports in other countries. The first is that they are able to maintain a spirit of benevolence, not only rejoicing in the successes of others, but also worrying about their failures. Whenever opponents are injured or suffer, they are treated with great compassion. Second, their aim is not only victory but study, each time considering why they have lost, or why their opponents have won, and striving to improve. These two principles are the characteristics of sportsmen in foreign countries and should be emulated by our sportsmen. As for our nation, interest in sports has grown rapidly in recent years. As for football, for example, in the past there were only five or six hundred spectators, but now there are more than ten thousand. It is hoped that everyone present will pay attention to the spirit of justice and altruism in the current sports boom. I would also like to wish that you will achieve victory during the National Games and win awards at the Far Eastern Games so that our Chinese sportsmen may one day compete in the World Games". A commemorative photo was then taken.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Government and Business Rescue the Rice Shortage <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Price limited to 20 yuan</p>
<p>Subsidized sales to be held</p>
<p>Checking stock in production areas</p>
<p>Reasons for Rice Price Increase: The price of rice has been soaring for days, even exceeding 20 yuan. According to investigations, in addition to the scarcity of goods arriving from various places, the main reason is that the output of foreign rice from Saigon and other places has recently decreased, and procurement has become difficult. As a result, the original price has risen sharply. The recent import cost is estimated at 20 yuan and 5 jiao per 200 pounds, an increase of nearly 10% in the past two weeks. As a result, the price of rice has continued to rise. In recent days, rice merchants from various places have ordered approximately 500,000 tons of new rice from Saigon and other places for May delivery, and approximately 300,000 tons for June delivery. The price is around 20 yuan, so the price of rice is unlikely to fall in the short term.</p>
<p>Government Price Limit: The Municipal Social Bureau, in response to the continuous rise in rice prices in this city, has received reports from the Food Committee and has long been preparing for subsidized rice sales, but has not yet been able to hold them due to the difficulty in raising large sums of money. However, a Rice Subsidized Price Committee has been established and is purchasing 200,000 bags of foreign rice to handle subsidized sales, which has been submitted to the mayor for approval. Yesterday, the price of special japonica rice in the northern city was as high as 21 yuan and 2 jiao per stone, so a public notice has been issued (see today's newspaper advertisement) temporarily limiting the highest price of white rice to 20 yuan per stone, with lower grades priced separately. In the meantime, other methods are being considered to stabilize rice prices and prioritize people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Rice Merchant Meeting: Ye Huijun, chairman of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, believes that the current time is spring, and it is not yet the time of year when supplies are scarce, but top-quality rice has already risen to more than 20 yuan, and medium-quality rice also requires 18 or 19 yuan. If relief is not planned in advance, the consequences would be unthinkable. Yesterday, he specially discussed with the leaders of the rice industry. Ye said, "The recent rise in rice prices is really due to the poor harvest in the production areas last year, which has led to a weak supply. Fortunately, foreign rice is being shipped to Shanghai for relief, otherwise it would be even worse. However, the rice-producing areas such as Saigon have seen a surge in procurement by Shanghai merchants, and prices have also risen. This year's foreign rice has risen by one yuan and several jiao compared to last year, which is an especially unusual situation." After discussion, the Rice Industry Federation was asked to send letters to various production areas to investigate the stock in the production areas for reference, so as to have a grasp of the situation. At the same time, fellow traders were informed that in case of shortage, buyers should be advised not to rush or over-collect, and customers should be instructed to put samples on sale as soon as the goods arrive, so as to prevent the market from being short of goods and alleviate the current market situation.</p>

We have telegraphed the Kuala Lumpur Post Office and received a reply stating that the office did not declare to the overseas Chinese representatives that the case was initiated by the Chinese government. Now the government of the Malay Archipelago has notified that the increase in postal fees will be implemented from April 1st of this year. A corresponding letter is sent requesting support and guidance." On the same day, a letter from Lin Jindian, Chairman of the Xinjiapo (Singapore) Petition for Postal Fee Reduction, stated: "The Resident Overseas Chinese Representative Assembly has petitioned the residential government to extend the implementation for four months in order to resolve the petition and revoke the decision." This has been received.</p>
<p>"The Singapore government's reply to the overseas Chinese representatives was based on inquiries to the Kuala Lumpur Post Office, which is irrelevant and cannot be explained.

<h3 id="e126">Committee for the Reorganization of Business Organizations Cables to Request Relief for Chinese Tobacco Merchants <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Committee for the Reorganization of Business Organizations cabled the Ministry of Finance yesterday to request relief for Chinese tobacco merchants, stating: "To the esteemed Nanjing Ministry of Finance: On the 25th of this month, we received a respectful telegram from the Guangzhou Chinese Tobacco Commercial Association, stating that the selling price of cigarettes is based on the customs tax rate. Now it is being recalculated based on the gold price, and the tax amount has increased. Since the tax amount has increased, the original wholesale price should also increase accordingly. For other items, pricing is free, and although the tax amount has increased, it can be passed on. However, there are precedents for cigarette pricing that do not allow for arbitrary increases. If the tax amount increases but the wholesale price does not increase, the tax law is already unfair, and the losses are even more difficult to bear. We urgently telegram and appeal for permission to increase the wholesale price of cigarettes set by the Unified Tax Office based on the customs tax rate, in order to maintain the business. We hope that you will forward this request to the Ministry of Finance and the Cigarette Unified Tax Office. We would be immensely grateful. The association has repeatedly submitted detailed reports on the various painful situations of Chinese tobacco merchants, where the predetermined number of grades is too large and prices cannot be increased freely, and even though material costs have soared, they can only be sold at a loss, in various industrial plans for relief presented by the affiliated association, and in the previous two telegrams transferred from the association requesting relaxed price limits. The fundamental solution for relief is to change the unified tax to a two-tier collection system, as proposed in the document submitted by the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company to your department, which is the most thorough solution. Unfortunately, it has not been adopted, so that the suffering of tobacco merchants has not been alleviated, and the two factories of Nanyang Changxing in this city have also closed down due to deep losses. It is a tragedy that business is so difficult. Now that the Customs is levying taxes on cigarettes and their required materials based on the gold price, while the wholesale price is still fixed according to the old limits, it is impossible for tobacco merchants to continue to support the situation of selling at a loss with pain. The request to allow the Cigarette Unified Tax Office to increase the wholesale price of cigarettes based on the customs tax rate is a request that is urgently needed at the moment and is different from revising the unified tax grades, which require detailed review. As for your department's March 15th approval of the eastern telegraph of the affiliated association, it is stated that the sharp rise in gold prices not only affects the cigarette industry, and the government should plan for comprehensive relief, and that piecemeal relief is not allowed. It is understood that although various industries have been affected by the sharp rise in gold prices, they are still able to increase prices freely to compensate, which is completely different from the situation of the cigarette industry, which can only watch the gold price rise day by day and only sell at a loss. Moreover, it is difficult to make a decision on government relief to various industries, such as silk and shipping, which require the allocation of subsidies, as they involve public funds. As for relaxing the price limits, the issuance of an order from your department in the morning would immediately relieve the tobacco merchants' predicament in the evening, which would be a beneficial act at no cost. If it is necessary to wait for comprehensive planning and handle the matter together, we are sincerely afraid that it will take a long time, and all Chinese tobacco factories will inevitably close down before then. The repetition of Nanyang Changxing's previous situation is unbearable. Therefore, we have quickly expressed our concerns and submitted this report with trepidation. We humbly request your department to promptly approve this request to relieve the imminent danger. We are overwhelmed with hope. Respectfully, the Shanghai Special City Merchant Groups Reorganization Committee."</p>

<p>Zhang Yahua, Zhu Shengmo, and Wang Yibing, former executive committee members of the Baoshan County Party Headquarters, were arrested on December 17th of last year on suspicion of being reactionary elements, as per a telegram order from Miao Bin, the director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. Subsequently, various sectors of Baoshan made multiple efforts to rescue them, but to no avail. Zhu Shengmo was released on bail due to illness. Zhang and Wang have been detained for over three months. The Baoshan County Magistrate, Wu Jianong, received instructions from the Civil Affairs Department on the 25th (day before yesterday), stating that Zhang Yahua and others had been investigated by the Readjustment Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters and found to have no reactionary behavior. He was ordered to instruct the County Public Security Bureau to release them on bail. Upon receiving the order, Magistrate Wu immediately instructed Shen Qing, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, to find guarantors for Zhang Yahua and others, and they were released at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e130">General Manager of the Gas Company Denies Making Statements <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Conversations Published in the Wenhui Bao</p>
<p>On the 20th of this month, the Wenhui Bao reported that Canning, the General Manager of the Shanghai Gas Company, had made a four-point statement to the newspaper representative regarding the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau's deadline for signing a contract with the Municipal Government: (1) The company supplies gas to 30 foreign households in Zhabei, and the Chinese authorities are demanding a share of the profits; (2) Until last year, the company paid 1,000 taels of silver annually for road excavation fees, but stopped paying in April of last year due to continuous demands from the Public Utilities Bureau; (3) The company treats the authorities in both the Chinese and foreign concessions equally; (4) It is not justified for Chinese to demand a share of the profits based on the fact that foreigners outside the concession are using the company's gas. Upon seeing this news, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau listed the facts and refuted each point of the aforementioned person's statement, disclosing them in various Chinese and foreign newspapers in the city on the 22nd. On the same day, it also sent a serious letter of inquiry to the said person. It was learned yesterday that the said person had officially replied to Director Huang of the Bureau, stating that he had not made the aforementioned statement to the Wenhui Bao representative. He also made some statements regarding the reasons for the delay in signing the contract. The original letter is translated and published below: In response to your letter of the 22nd of this month, I declare that I did not have a conversation with a Wenhui Bao representative. It was not until I read the Dalu News on the 24th that I learned about the matter. However, on the morning of the 20th, indeed, a reporter from that newspaper came to the office, holding a clipping from The Times newspaper, asking about the gas company receiving a final notice from the Public Utilities Bureau. I replied that I knew nothing about the matter and had nothing to say. After the reporter left, Mr. Potter (i.e., the company's Chief Engineer) arrived, carrying your Bureau's letter of the 19th (i.e., the letter giving a final consideration deadline). When asked what it was about, we discussed your letter in detail, believing that a face-to-face meeting would be the most appropriate. Therefore, Mr. Potter sent a letter to arrange a meeting. As for your belief that the delay in signing the contract is due to the fact that the contract must be translated into English before formally seeking opinions from all parties, it is because the directors of a limited company must be responsible to the shareholders. It can be asserted that the gas company is willing to contribute to society in order to enjoy the franchise. We believe that after our explanation, your office will understand the company's position. It was also learned that yesterday (the 26th) at 10:30 AM, Canning, the General Manager of the company, and Potter, the Chief Engineer, went to the Bureau as scheduled to discuss the contract signing issue. It is reported that the company agreed to all the conditions in the contract and expressed its willingness to sign at any time. However, regarding Article 8, which requires the Municipal Government to order the relocation of gas pipes within a specified period, and Article 11, which requires the annual settlement and payment of additional guarantee money due to the increase in pipelines, they requested slight changes. The Bureau agreed to forward the request to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce for consideration and promised to respond to the company within a few days before scheduling the contract signing again.</p>

<p>Notices from the Bureau of Public Works and the Land Bureau to Various Oil Companies to Comply. The Bureau of Public Works and the Land Bureau, following instructions from the Municipal Government, in accordance with a letter from the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee, based on the resolution of the Fourth Representative Assembly of the Fifth District Party Headquarters, requesting the Municipal Government to ban oil depots near the Gao Miao area of the Lühang District, etc., designated Laoshu Sha as the oil depot area of the city. This was intended to ban oil depots in Pudong and Puxi to avoid danger. The oil depots in the Shangmiao area of the Lühang District are naturally included in the ban. The Bureau of Public Works and the Land Bureau were instructed to jointly notify all oil merchants to immediately move all oil depots to Laoshu Sha to ensure safety, etc. It is reported that the Bureau of Public Works and the Land Bureau have followed the order and jointly notified Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum, Texaco, Guangyu, and other oil companies that if they need to build additional oil depots in the future, they should comply with the eight measures for delineating the oil depot area. All oil depots already built outside the oil depot area should also be moved to the oil depot area as soon as possible to ensure safety.</p>

<p>Fog Obstruction of Ships Entering Port. Heavy fog occurred outside Wusong the night before last, obstructing nearly twenty Chinese and foreign merchant ships from entering the port. By yesterday morning, the fog had dissipated, and the ships began to arrive in Shanghai one after another. However, the American Mail Line's President Jefferson ran aground on the 25th due to low tide and was unable to move, obstructing many ships coming to Shanghai behind it. It was not until 11:30 AM yesterday that the Jefferson was able to take advantage of the rising tide, leave the shallows, and enter the Huangpu River. The merchant ships that were backed up behind it were also able to gradually enter Wusong. By 4:00 PM, as many as thirty-two merchant ships had arrived in Shanghai. The Jianghe and other ships, due to the delay in entering the port, are planning to postpone their departure by one day.</p>
<p>Unloading and Inspection of Damaged Ship Cargo. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha's Kasato Maru was damaged in Kobe harbor by the Osaka Shosen Kaisha's American merchant ship Arabia Maru, and much of the cargo in the hold was stained and damaged by water. The cargo has now been loaded onto the Mikasa Maru and brought to Shanghai. Yesterday, the company notified all consignees that the stained and damaged cargo from the Kasato Maru will be handled in accordance with the law of general average. It has been decided that the cargo will be unloaded and inspected at the Yangshupu Huishan Wharf this morning, with the inspection conducted by a surveyor. Consignees are requested to send representatives to the site for joint inspection. In addition, the damaged cargo on the Nisshin Kisen's Ba Ling Maru is also being unloaded in Pudong, and a date will be set for a joint inspection of the damage. Furthermore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Ming entered port this time with 444 bags of flour and over 70 pieces of miscellaneous goods in the second hold that were damaged by seawater. The company has ordered the business department to thoroughly investigate the cause of the damage.</p>
<p>Sharp Reduction in Chinese Ships to Fuzhou. There were originally four Chinese ships operating on the Shanghai-Fuzhou route. After suspending service last winter, service only resumed in the middle of this month. However, most of the cargo on that route has been taken by Japanese ships. By the time the Chinese ships resumed operations, there was no cargo to load. Therefore, the Ningshao Company first stopped the Yongxing on the Shanghai-Min route and reassigned it to the Yangtze River route. Yesterday, the Sanbei Company also reassigned the Xin Ningxing to the Yangtze River route, leaving only two ships operating on the Fuzhou route.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Increase Ships in North China. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, a Japanese company, originally used six ships this year to operate three coastal routes in China. Now, they have added a newly built 3,500-ton ship, the Kei Saki Maru, to Shanghai. It has already arrived in Shanghai. It was originally intended to operate on the Zhejiang-Min coastal route, but due to the relatively large number of passengers traveling to and from North China, it has been approved to start its maiden voyage from Shanghai to Tianjin today.</p>

<p>Italian Mail Ships Cease Passenger Service. Since the Italian Mail Line in Shanghai added four new motor engine oil-powered mail ships last year, it has been paying great attention to carrying passengers. Each month, a formal mail ship is operated, with cabins divided into first class and third class. After last autumn, four cargo-only ships were added to the Sino-Italian route, running once every six months, without passengers. There has been a significant improvement in the transport of Italian goods recently, with sesame and ramie being the largest export to that country. Each ship now carries over 10,000 bags. Recently, the Shanghai branch received a telegram from the Italian headquarters stating that passenger service on ships from Shanghai to Italy will be discontinued from June 4th. The Shanghai branch was ordered to end ticket sales by the end of May. Yesterday, the branch notified its branches in Tianjin, Hankou, and Lianyungang, instructing them to stop selling tickets for ships to Italy in June. The reason is unknown.</p>
<p>Changes in Transporting Goods to the Philippines. Shipments from Shanghai to North Africa were previously transported on European ships to Marseilles, France, and then transferred. Shipping costs were collected and guaranteed by shipping companies in Shanghai. The European Shipping Association in Shanghai specially invited representatives from various shipping companies and decided that from today, shipping companies will no longer guarantee the transport of goods from Shanghai to North Africa. They will only be carried to Marseilles, and those that need to be transferred to the Philippines will be transferred to North African ships in France. The freight will be paid by the cargo owners. The shipping rates agreed upon by the Shanghai Association are as follows: (1) To Tripoli, 16 shillings per ton of miscellaneous goods; (2) To Benghazi, 25 shillings per ton; (3) To Casablanca, Spain, 15 shillings per ton; (4) To Port Lyautey or Arzew, France, 20 shillings per ton; (5) To Safi, Rabat, and Bône in North Africa, 25 shillings per ton each. Yesterday, this measure was notified to twenty-five European shipping companies for consistent implementation.</p>

<p>Shao Shuhua and Jiang Jiazhui, former county magistrates of Shanghai County, embezzled housing tax funds during their terms of office. Although they have been out of office for some time, they have not yet surrendered the funds. Now, the County Local Assets Management Committee believes that the housing tax funds belong to the local area. If the funds are not urgently recovered, the matter will inevitably be delayed indefinitely. It was resolved at a recent meeting to specially urge the surrender of the funds. A letter was immediately sent to the County Government, and County Magistrate Leng instructed the Finance Bureau to comply yesterday.</p>

<p>The China National Anti-Narcotics Association has been making unremitting efforts to investigate and promote the anti-drug situation among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and the overseas anti-drug movement. Huang Jiawei, the general manager of the association, recently went to the British and Dutch territories in Southeast Asia for inspection and promotion, achieving great results.

Anti-drug organizations and smoking cessation hospitals are being actively organized in Singapore, Yogyakarta, Semarang, Batavia, Surabaya, Bandung, Medan, and other places. Local celebrities and enthusiastic overseas individuals are also actively participating. The Singapore Chin Woo Athletic Association was established 30 years ago and had branches throughout British territories such as Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and Malacca. It had branches in all these places. However, it was interrupted due to some events and has been suspended for 20 years. This time, thanks to Mr. Huang's advocacy and promotion, the people's spirit was greatly encouraged, leading to the revival of the Chin Woo Athletic Association. Other places are also actively preparing to cooperate with the China National Anti-Narcotics Association.

<h3 id="e143">The Da Lun Real Estate Lawsuit: Appeal to the Supreme Court <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Citing the Yan Mao Yuan Old Case</p>
<p>Demanding the Exercise of Ownership</p>
<p>Original Judgment from the Court of Appeal</p>
<p>A Concern for All Shanghai Citizens</p>
<p>Following the second instance judgment in the lawsuit between Da Lun Real Estate Company and its tenants, including Lao Da Fang, regarding relocation, the tenants were victorious. However, this case has drawn increased attention from those who own property. It is reported that Da Lun Company has received the judgment from the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>The company has decided to file a third appeal with the Supreme Court in the capital, intending to cite the judgment in the case of Yan Mao Yuan Hotel versus landlord Ma Huanwen regarding relocation as the sole basis for the appeal. The Yan Mao Yuan's lawsuit against landlord Ma Huanwen for forced relocation was decided by the Provisional Court in July, ordering Yan Mao Yuan to relocate by July 15th. The judgment stated that the defendant's reconstruction of the house was based on the exercise of ownership, which is a disposition of property rights, and that the plaintiff, as a tenant, could not directly prevent the exercise of property rights based on the relationship of debt. Yan Mao Yuan, dissatisfied, appealed, but the Court of Appeal rejected the appeal and upheld the original judgment. The Court of Appeal's judgment also stated, "According to a lease agreement with no fixed term, the parties may request termination at any time." Da Lun argues that since the shops on Nanjing Road, Zhifu Li, leased by Lao Da Fang and others, do not have a lease specifying a term, the landlord's repossession for reconstruction is, in fact, an exercise of ownership and a disposition of property rights. They will now detail the reasons based on this interpretation, requesting a reversal from the Supreme Court. Therefore, the ultimate victor in this case remains to be seen. However, the Court of Appeal's judgment is also of great concern to all Shanghai citizens. We now present the full text of the judgment:</p>
<p>Appellants: Lao Da Fang Tea and Food Store and fifteen other households</p>
<p>Appellee: Da Lun Real Estate Company</p>
<p>Regarding the case of a lawsuit over the relocation of houses involving the aforementioned two parties, the appellants, dissatisfied with the first instance judgment made by the Shanghai Concession Provisional Court on November 21st of the 18th year of the Republic of China, appealed. This court's judgment is as follows:</p>
<p>(Main Text) The original judgment is reversed, except for the portions concerning Shi Wantai and Shao Wansheng. The appellee's lawsuit in the first instance is dismissed, except for the aforementioned portions. The costs of the first and second lawsuits shall be borne by the appellee. Lao Quan Chang's appeal shall be rejected, and the costs of the appeal shall be borne by Lao Quan Chang.</p>
<p>(Facts) The appellee owns houses located at the corner of Nanjing Road and Fujian Road and within Zhifu Li, which have been rented by the appellants. In October of the 17th year, the appellee leased the real estate to Da Zhonghua Department Store for reconstruction and business, and requested the appellants to vacate, but they were unwilling to relocate. The appellee sued, and the original trial ruled that the lease agreement should be terminated at the end of October of the 18th year, and that the defendants should return the houses within one month and twenty days after the termination. Based on the plaintiff's request, they were ordered to provide a security deposit of 20,000 taels of silver, which would be executed immediately. The appellants, dissatisfied, appealed. After the hearing began, the appellee withdrew the request for immediate execution and attempted mediation, which was unsuccessful. This is the factual background of the case. The appellants' statement requests the reversal of the original judgment and the dismissal of the appellee's lawsuit in the original trial. The main points of their appeal are as follows: Chinese merchants value good faith and trustworthiness above all else. Consensual contracts exist at any time. The appellants, Lao Da Fang, Yi An Ju, etc., certainly had an oral agreement with the deceased manager of the appellee, Sun Rongqing, at the beginning of the lease, specifying a lease term of 20 years. Pan Yuting, the brother of the manager Pan Jiaping, who was originally assigned the house in Yi An Ju, has already testified to this effect in the original trial and can be believed. Furthermore, the appellants who are renting the houses for business are also determined not to move frequently. The case of Yi An Ju is the same. By analogy, this can serve as proof that all other families must have had the same oral agreement. However, the original trial did not adopt this, which is difficult to accept. Moreover, according to Shanghai custom, unless (1) the landlord reclaims the house for their own use, (2) the tenant is three months in arrears of rent, or (3) the house is damaged and needs to be rebuilt, the landlord cannot order the tenant to relocate. Moreover, after reconstruction, the old tenant has a preferential right to lease. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association has issued a letter proving that this is the case. Now that the appellants are not in arrears of rent, and the houses were built less than ten years ago, and there is no need for reconstruction, the appellee is heeding Da Zhonghua Department Store's offer of higher rent and is not reclaiming it for its own use. Not only does this render the small rent spent by the appellants in the past and the huge amount of decoration that came with the house a waste of money, but it is also difficult to find a house to relocate to in the crowded city of Nanjing Road. It only seeks its own interests and disregards the interests of others. How can this be good for the social economy? What about the reputation of the business community? It is obviously contrary to general custom, and the law cannot recognize it. If it is said that the house ticket once stipulated that both parties could terminate the contract at any time, this one-sided, boilerplate document is clearly contrary to custom. How can it have a binding effect? The appellee's statement requests the rejection of the appeal and, ex officio, the declaration of immediate execution of the original judgment. The main points of their response are as follows: The appellee's leased houses all have written contracts for those with fixed terms. Those with no fixed term do not. For example, the appellant Hua Ying Pharmacy signed a written contract in the 11th year of the Republic of China, which expired in the 17th year of the Republic of China and was not renewed. This is proof that a fixed-term lease must be established in writing. None of the appellants hold written documents but dare to claim that there is an oral agreement for a term of 20 years. According to the saying that merchants value good faith, this is truly regrettable. Moreover, looking at Hua Ying Pharmacy, even with a written contract, it was only for six years. Would there be a reason for not signing a written document for twenty years? Pan Yuting is the brother of Jiaping, and his testimony is insufficient. As for the customs recognized by law, they must be obvious, long-standing, and publicly practiced. Now, the appellants argue that the reasons for relocation are limited to arrears of rent, own use, or damage to the house requiring reconstruction, and that old tenants have preferential leasing rights, and that the house cannot be reclaimed otherwise. In fact, there has never been this custom. For decades, the architecture of the Public Concession has been changing day by day, reaching its current state. If there is a custom as claimed by the appellants, it would be impossible to rebuild existing houses. Recently, companies such as Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun, as well as Shenzhou and Dongfang Hotels, etc., are all newly built, and the users are not the landlords, nor can it be said that the original tenants are in arrears of rent. Their original houses were not damaged, nor were they rented by the original tenants. All of these can be said to be counter-evidence of the absence of custom. Moreover, there is a special agreement between the parties that is contrary to custom, that is, the house ticket once indicated that both parties have the right to terminate the contract at any time. Why should they use custom as an excuse, abandon the record of the house ticket, and fail to apply it? (Reasoning) The appellants' main points are two: (1) term; (2) custom. Regarding the fact that the appellee leased the houses in question, all those with agreed terms, such as the former Mao Fu Company (the former tenant of the Nanyang Socks Factory) and the appellant Hua Ying Pharmacy (fixed for six years, which has expired), have signed written contracts. If other tenants have also agreed to a term, totaling 20 years, why would they not write a document? Moreover, the appellants are also willing to automatically increase the rent by an additional 40,000 taels per year, in addition to the original amount of more than 60,000 taels, as a condition to cancel the repossession of the houses. The oral agreement for a term of 20 years is not credible. As for whether there is a custom in Shanghai shops regarding the eviction of houses as claimed by the appellants, the Provisional Court has investigated and adopted local customs when handling cases of shop relocation, recognizing that the landlord's eviction must be for the purpose of reclaiming it for his own use, and that seeking profit through digging is not permitted by custom (such as cases No. 3367, 3802, and 3867 in the General Division of the 17th year). However, it should be thoroughly investigated whether this custom is obvious and commonly practiced, as it is an important point of contention between the two parties. Now, the Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association has sent a letter stating that it believes that the custom claimed by the appellants is indeed present and solemnly proves that it is the case, and that if this leasing custom is not recognized, the impact will be significant. The members of the Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association are mostly members of the capitalist class, so they can represent the psychology of the majority of people in the Concession. There is considerable proof that this custom is clearly prevalent. Furthermore, judging from the reason and the law, at the beginning of the lease, the landlord has already demanded several months' rent from the tenant and acknowledged that the tenant has spent thousands or tens of thousands of gold on renovations. If they can dig up the lease and give it to someone else at any time, without giving considerable compensation or allowing them to stop business and relocate, it is not forgiving in terms of sentiment and unfair in terms of reason. Since the aforementioned custom does not go against good morals, it should be recognized as valid. Now, the appellants are not in arrears of rent, the house was built less than ten years ago, there is no need for reconstruction, and the appellants have no possibility of continuing to rent after reconstruction and improvement. The eviction is causing the rent and renovation expenses to be wasted. It is difficult to recognize this as legitimate. As for the one-sided record in the house ticket, it is not a deed signed by both parties and is difficult to treat it as a special agreement. Just as the house tickets of each family all contain records prohibiting substitution and subletting, but tenants' substitutions or subletting are commonly practiced, how can one use the words that the contract can be terminated at any time in the house ticket as an excuse, regardless of the tenant's losses, and demand immediate relocation? As for the reply from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee, although it is not as solid a proof as that from the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, it does not absolutely deny the aforementioned custom. The court can weigh the circumstances and choose to use it as the basis for the judgment. The original trial did not clearly investigate the customary facts claimed by the appellants and made a relocation judgment hastily, which cannot be maintained. However, the appellant Le Quanchang is not a party in the original trial, and how its interests are related is neither stated in the written statement nor personally presented in court. It is of course unqualified, and the appeal of the appellant should be rejected. Based on the above, the appeal of Le Quanchang is illegal, and the appeal of the other appellants is justified. In accordance with Articles 103 and 12 of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure of the Mixed Court and Article 203 of the Civil Procedure Regulations, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Four Banks Reserve Depository Robbery Case Involves Bank Messengers <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Chen Sanxing is the Main Culprit in this Case</p>
<p>His Confession Still Tries to Pass the Blame to Others</p>
<p>The Messenger Has Been Bailed Out by the Bank</p>
<p>But Must Be Monitored for All Actions</p>
<p>The preparation treasury of the China &amp; South Sea Bank, the Continental Bank, the Jin Cheng Bank, and the Salt Bank was robbed by bandits, with 46,000 yuan of cash and banknotes stolen. The Lao Zha Police Station has been successively arresting the major male and female criminals involved in the case, with eight people apprehended. Previously, Detective Xie Shuiquan and Investigator Zhao Rongsheng of the General Police Station learned that the main culprit in the case, named Chen Sanxing, was from Suzhou. However, his whereabouts were still unknown. However, his younger brother Chen Aba is currently a tea server at the Oriental Hotel. Therefore, they went to the hotel to arrest Aba, hoping to find out where his brother was hiding. Aba confessed at the police station that several of his brothers knew where Sanxing was hiding, but his eldest brother Chen Biao knew. He also said that Chen Biao lived at No. 14 Beile Road in the French Concession. Detective Yan then contacted the French Police Station to request assistance. The police chief dispatched detectives to go to the address and arrest Chen Biao. He knew the address of his younger brother Sanxing and led Detective Yan, Investigator Zhao, and detectives Jin Guanya, etc., to search for him at No. 382 Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, Hongkou. Chen Sanxing was there and unable to escape. He was arrested without resistance. Because the case was being handled by the Lao Zha Police Station, the three Chen brothers were transferred to the Lao Zha Police Station. After questioning, the police chief released Chen Biao and Chen Aba because they were not involved. Chen Sanxing confessed that he was a lookout during the robbery and that they did not initially know that the preparation treasury of the four banks was sending a large sum of money to the Commercial Bank on the Bund that day. He said that they only went to commit the robbery after the messenger of the Commercial Bank reported it. The police chief then sent Detective Liang Chengyu to the Commercial Bank on the Bund with Chen Sanxing to investigate the names of the messengers who reported the information. The bank ordered all of its messengers to stand in a row for Chen to identify. Chen carefully observed them for a week and pointed out one person, saying that he was the informant. Detective Liang then took him back to the police station. He said that his name was Zhou Zhikang and that he was from Shaoxing. Yesterday morning, he and Chen Sanxing were escorted to the Provisional Court, where Judge Gao Junxiang interrogated them. Ru Baoyi, the police station's lawyer, presented Chen's confession to the court, stating that the thief had confessed at the police station and that he was afraid that he would recant during the next court hearing. He requested that he be questioned first. Judge Gao interrogated Chen Sanxing, who confessed that on the morning of the 13th of this month, he went to the Yihong brothel in the French Concession to ask Yuan Genfa for 40 yuan he owed. He saw Zhou Zhikang, Sanguang, Amao, Yuan Laoda, etc., all whispering in the brothel. He asked Yuan Laoda what Zhou did, and Yuan said that Zhou was a cook at the bank. Later, because Yuan did not return the money he owed, he went to room 24 of the Nanjing Hotel to find Yuan to collect the debt. Yuan gave him 100 yuan. He thought that he only owed 40 yuan and that he was suddenly repaying 100 yuan. He also knew that his behavior was bad, so he expected that this 60 yuan must be ill-gotten gains, so he refused to accept it. However, Yuan was angry and said that if he did not accept the money, he would be unfavorable to him and promised to reward him with another 700 yuan. He then said that their money had just been robbed from the Commercial Bank. Only then did he realize that they were whispering in the brothel that morning, planning the robbery. When questioned, Zhou Zhikang completely denied conspiring with Yuan, etc., in the brothel to commit the robbery. The Commercial Bank also hired a lawyer to go to court to request that Zhou be released on bail. Xie Guangfu, the bank's president, went to the case to state that he was willing to vouch for Zhou to wait for the interrogation outside. There was no concern that he would flee. Judge Gao ordered Chen Sanxing to be detained and Zhou Zhikang to be released on bail by the Commercial Bank. He was ordered to come whenever summoned, and the president of the bank was responsible for monitoring his actions and not allowing him to talk to others.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Murder by Robbers in Eastern Victoria Harbour at Midnight <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>An Unexpected Tragedy for a Modest Family</p>
<p>Loving Money as Life, Shouting for Help</p>
<p>Saying They Were Acquainted Led to Fatal Attack</p>
<p>Two Bullets Resulted in Instant and Tragic Death</p>
<p>The robbery and murder of Zhu Xiaomao took place in Eastern Victoria Harbour near the Water and Electricity Plant in Yinhang District, Hudong, the night before last, at midnight. A special account is provided below.</p>
<p>A Prosperous Family, Coveted by Robbers Zhu Xiaomao was 43 years old and from Baoshan County. His wife, Sun, was also of a similar age. Zhu had neither brothers nor children, only the couple. Their home was an ancestral house in Eastern Victoria Harbour with several acres of farmland for cultivation. Zhu also opened a restaurant in the town, taking care of business in the store every day, leaving his wife at home to farm. Therefore, expenses were saved and productivity was strong, and the family was prosperous, leading to covetousness by robbers.</p>
<p>Cash All Hidden in Pant Belt Pocket After the restaurant closed the day before yesterday, Zhu obtained more than 30 yuan of cash from the market and returned home. After dinner, he talked with his wife for a while, forgetting to hand over the cash to his wife. All the cash was hidden in the pant belt pocket. The villagers rested early, and soon the couple closed the door and went to sleep, traveling in the land of sweet dreams.</p>
<p>Robbers Arrive at Midnight, Couple Bound By midnight, the door was pounded like a drum, waking the Zhu couple. Sensing something was wrong, they dared not open the door. Zhu, because he had more than 30 yuan, tied his pant belt around his body to avoid being robbed. Unexpectedly, the door was opened, and two people entered, while others were still outside. The Zhu couple, seeing that the people who came were not good, kept silent. The bandits then plundered, obtaining only five or six pieces of clothing. The place where the cash was hidden was not found. The bandits seemed to know well that Zhu had money on him and robbed him of his pant belt. Zhu, loving money as life, struggled desperately and shouted for help. The bandits were angry and bound the Zhu couple separately, first taking away Zhu's pant belt for further extortion of money.</p>
<p>Two Shots Fired, Tragic Scream and Death At this time, Zhu, seeing that the money was being robbed, looked closely at the two bandits and said, "I recognize you. Why are you so urgent to force me?" The bandits, hearing this, immediately looked alarmed, drew their guns, and fired at Zhu to silence him. One bullet flew out and struck Zhu's buttocks, passing through. Zhu was wounded and fell to the ground, and the second bullet struck the back of his head, causing him to scream tragically and die in a pool of blood. The bandits, seeing that a blood crime had been committed, stopped searching and left.</p>
<p>Crying and Screaming Beside the Corpse After the bandits left, Zhu's wife, Sun, cried and screamed beside the corpse. Neighbors heard the sound and rushed over. Because it was in the countryside, far from the police station, they released her from her bonds and reported to the Yishiertu neighborhood chief, Xu Jiabin, who rushed to investigate and reported to the relevant police station, which immediately sent officers to search. The bandits had already gone far away. The police asked about the appearance and accent of the robbers in order to pursue them.</p>
<p>Court Inquest and Wanted for Murder Yesterday morning, the neighborhood chief Xu Jiabin submitted a statement to the local court for an inquest. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Liu and Coroner Xuan and others arrived at the scene and confirmed that the deceased Zhu Xiaomao had indeed died of gunshot wounds during his lifetime. They ordered the corpse to be collected and sent separate letters to various agencies to issue a warrant for the arrest of the murderers, so that they could be brought to justice.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Judgment in the Case Against Deng Zhongze <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The case against Deng Zhongze, the general supervisor of the Fuan Life Insurance Company, who was previously accused of fraud by Liu Yulin, Shen Shulin, Zhang Fuqing, etc., was heard in the Provisional Court. Deng also filed a counterclaim against Deng Wenhai, Wu Hanzhou, Wu Shutang, etc., accusing them of false accusations. After many trials, there were no less than fifty or sixty plaintiffs and defendants, and more than thirty lawyers, including He Shiming, He Xianzhang, Qu Yue, and Yao Jian. As a result, this case has attracted much attention. The judgment was rendered on March 6, and Deng Zhongze was found not guilty. The original judgment is transcribed below:</p>
<p>"Main Text" Deng Zhongze is not guilty. The part of the civil lawsuit attached by the plaintiff is transferred to the Civil Division of this court for trial. Deng Wenhai, Wu Hanzhou, and Wu Shutang are not guilty.</p>
<p>"Facts" Deng Zhongze was the general supervisor of Fuan Insurance and Warehouse Co., Ltd. The company was established in the 27th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, with its headquarters located on Des Voeux Road, Hong Kong, and registered with the Hong Kong government. In the 32nd year of Guangxu, a branch was established at No. 51 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai. In the 4th year of the Republic of China, the Hong Kong Fuan headquarters also handled life insurance and deposited a security deposit of 22,000 pounds with the British government in accordance with British insurance regulations. In the 5th year of the Republic of China, it registered with the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in Beijing. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, the Hong Kong Fuan headquarters, due to the lack of development in the life insurance business in Hong Kong, entrusted the Shanghai China Fuan Life Insurance Company to handle the life insurance business. The office of the so-called Fuan Life Insurance Company was located in the office of the Shanghai branch of the Hong Kong Fuan Company at No. 51 Jiangxi Road, and Deng Zhongze was also the general manager. It also independently issued articles of association, which contained the words "The headquarters of China Fuan Life Insurance Company is located in Shanghai." The premium receipts issued to policyholders were sometimes stamped with the seal of China Fuan Company and sometimes with the seal of the Shanghai branch of Hong Kong Fuan Company. In December of the 15th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai China Fuan Company also believed that there was no hope for the development of the life insurance business and stopped receiving new policyholders. However, it could not immediately seek to end the old policyholders and continued to collect premiums. When old policyholders died, it refunded the policy and paid compensation in accordance with the regulations, amounting to more than 200,000 yuan. In August of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Hong Kong Fuan Company, due to poor business performance, was resolved by the shareholders' meeting</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>to be liquidated as announced in the newspaper. Luo Zuosheng was appointed to handle the liquidation of the Hong Kong headquarters. Luo Zuosheng then authorized Deng Zhongze to act as the liquidator in Shanghai. In March of the 18th year of the Republic of China, Deng Zhongze appointed the British accountant Yimaoli as the liquidator. Because the Shanghai China Fuan Company published an advertisement in the newspaper in March of the 18th year of the Republic of China, stating that it was operating as usual, it aroused the attention of general policyholders of Hong Kong Fuan Company and Shanghai China Fuan Company, who believed that Deng Zhongze had falsely established China Fuan Company and defrauded them of premiums, and filed lawsuits with this court on charges of fraud and attached civil lawsuits, requesting the court to order the defendant Deng Zhongze to repay the premiums already paid by the plaintiffs. During the trial, Deng Zhongze argued that among the accusers, Wu Hanzhou and Wu Shutang's policies had already expired, and that Deng Wenhai's policy had been signed by himself and there was no room for dispute. They had fabricated facts and intended for others to be subjected to criminal punishment, which constituted the crime of false accusation. Therefore, he filed a counterclaim, requesting a joint judgment from the court. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Shou Sheng Nunnery at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road was resolved to be taken back by the Huzhou Association, which is composed of Huzhou people in Shanghai, and rebuilt into the Yingshi Memorial Hall. The Provisional Court was petitioned to order the monks of the nunnery to relocate on the 25th of this month. On the 24th, the abbess of the nunnery, Di Ming, led all the monks of the nunnery, holding incense and flags, to the court to petition, as reported in this newspaper. Because the monks were unable to meet with President Xu Weizhen, they left the petition at the court's reception office. They also stated that the cause of this matter was that Yang Kuihou, the custodian of the nunnery's deed, had transferred it to the Huzhou Association for safekeeping, and that the original source should still require Yang to find a solution. Therefore, they went to Yang's residence to negotiate, but to no avail. Yesterday (25th) was the deadline for relocation. The monks of the nunnery all gathered in the nunnery. From morning to night, there was no sign of any action. The court did not send officials to enforce it. Di Ming and others were still living in the nunnery. Yesterday, someone visited the monk Di Ming and asked what preparations he had made for the court's deadline to relocate. The monk replied that he was currently consulting with a lawyer on countermeasures and that he, as the abbess, would fulfill his responsibilities. It was rumored that the nunnery had been sealed off the day before yesterday, but this was not true.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received an instruction from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to a letter from the Beijing Municipal Government, stating that in the capital and other places, there are still private sales of martial arts tickets, savings tickets, and other similar lottery tickets. Although they have been strictly handled, these types of savings tickets, which are in the nature of lottery tickets, all come from the French Concession in Shanghai. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to investigate and prohibit them again, they are requesting that the French Consul General in Shanghai be promptly notified by letter to investigate and prohibit them together, so as to avoid future troubles. It is reported that after receiving the order, Director Chen has already forwarded the letter to the French Consul General in Shanghai, ordering all police stations to strictly investigate and prohibit them.</p>

<p>Gathering a Group of Women to Make a Scene in the Auditorium</p>
<p>Negotiating a Three-Chapter Law Through Friends' Mediation</p>
<p>Li Jinchang, a native of Anhui, 46 years old, runs the Changchun Teahouse on Haige Road, Xujiahui Town, and his business is very good. His wife, Wang, is nearly fifty years old and has not had any children. This spring, Li formed an inextricable bond with Cuiying, the daughter of the late Mao Di in Hongqiao Town, Xuhui, and their love was extraordinary. Cuiying also did not dislike Li's old age and willingly followed him, renting a house at No. 45 Xiaoyou Li and living together. They chose yesterday to officially marry at Yan Lechun in Xujiahui Town. Li's wife, Wang, learned of this and gathered many women from Jiangbei to rush to Li's residence at around 6:00 a.m. yesterday. They dragged a pair of mannequins from the bed and surrounded and beat Cuiying, causing her fair skin to turn blue and purple in an instant. Later, a cohabitant came out to mediate, and they dispersed. In the afternoon, Wang led dozens of women to Yan Lechun and completely destroyed the auditorium, throwing bowls and cups into the air, which was quite a sight. Fortunately, after the persuasion of many relatives and friends, Wang agreed to a three-chapter law: (1) No flower sedan chair allowed; (2) No living at Cuiying's place allowed; (3) No recognition of relatives. Li fully acknowledged this and knelt down to Wang repeatedly before the matter was settled.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly Sharing a Bed</p>
<p>And Then Fleeing Behind Her Husband's Back</p>
<p>Gu Liusheng, a man from Yangzhou residing at No. 140 Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei, engages in the used goods business. He is over thirty years old, and his wife, Madam Fan, is thirty-two years old and quite beautiful. They have been married for several years and their relationship is still harmonious. Recently, Gu frequently saw a young man visiting his home and conversing with his wife. When he inquired, she replied that it was her younger brother, Fan Jinyu, who had come from their hometown and had no place to stay, so he planned to stay for a few days. Gu, considering him a relative, treated him with hospitality. Little did he know that Fan Jinyu was not her brother, but her former lover. Because she disliked her husband for being unattractive and poor, while Jin Yu was a handsome young man with ample financial resources, they secretly rekindled their affair, using the guise of siblings to meet in secret. At first, Gu was completely unaware, but as time passed, he noticed their excessive intimacy and suspicions arose. One night, after returning home from work, he saw his wife and Jin Yu sleeping together in the same bed, entwined. He couldn't help but feel consumed by jealousy. He rushed forward and tore off the covers, revealing that they were both completely naked. Gu was furious and wanted to drag them to the police station, but Madam Fan, knowing she was in the wrong, knelt down and begged for forgiveness. Gu relented and immediately threw Jin Yu out of the house, also giving his wife a severe beating. However, her wild heart was difficult to tame. A few days ago, she secretly fled her husband and now lives with Jin Yu on Xihai Chang Road, behaving as if they were husband and wife. Gu, finding his wife missing, was certain she was hidden away by Jin Yu. He searched in every direction and the night before last, he discovered their address, went there, and arrested the pair of illicit lovers, handing them over to the patrol police. They were taken to the Fourth District Headquarters, where they were to be judged by the Judicial Section.</p>

<p>Jin Junde, a Taoist priest from Beixin Jing in the northwest of the district, hired lawyer Lu Ruizheng to file a lawsuit in the local court against his wife, Zhu Qiuyun, accusing her of insulting elders, being unruly, and making it impossible to live together, requesting a divorce. The defendant, Zhu Qiuyun, also hired lawyer Wang Chengkuan to present a defense, stating that the plaintiff had an affair with a woman named Xiufang while away from home, abandoning her and already having two sons and one daughter with the other woman. Therefore, she refused to divorce and requested to live together. This case had been heard twice without resolution, and the court ordered them to reconcile out of court. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao Zhenhai held a continued hearing. Both parties, accompanied by their lawyers, appeared in court. The judge briefly questioned both parties, and as a result, they reached an agreement to live separately. The plaintiff will pay the defendant a monthly living allowance of six yuan. The two boys (one seven years old, one four years old) will be raised by the plaintiff, and the ten-year-old girl will be raised by the defendant. The judge also stated in the settlement record that if the plaintiff fails to fulfill the agreement, the defendant may apply for enforcement, and the costs incurred shall be borne by the plaintiff. Both parties were satisfied, signed the agreement, and left the court.</p>

<p>Unable to Execute Due to Person Missing</p>
<p>Shen Dianru, a graduate of Wuben Girls' School, subsequently entered Bethel School and is now enrolled in Tongde Obstetrics School. Last winter, her fiancé, Dong Hanqin, hired lawyer Huang Yiyan to request the local court to confirm the validity of the engagement and select a date for the wedding. However, Shen Dianru filed a lawsuit to dissolve the engagement, arguing that the marriage had not been agreed to by her. Dong countered that if it was indeed without her consent, why had they corresponded for two years? The first instance resulted in a judgment confirming the validity of the engagement, and Shen Dianru lost the case. Unsatisfied, she appealed to the Suzhou Higher Court, but the second instance also resulted in Shen Dianru losing, and the judgment was finalized. Now, Dong Hanqin has submitted a petition to the local court requesting enforcement. Yesterday, Judge Wu of the Enforcement Court issued a summons for a hearing, but the defendant Shen Dianru could not be found. Therefore, Shen's younger sister, Shen Zhenru, appeared in court on her behalf, stating that she currently resides at No. 3 Chang Kang Li, Fangbang Bridge, Ximen. Her sister, Shen Dianru, disappeared from Tongde School on Shanhai Pass Road on February 2nd and there has been no news of her since. The plaintiff's side, represented by Dong's mother, Madam Dong Zhu, and lawyer Huang, requested enforcement. Judge Wu ordered that another summons be issued for the defendant Shen Dianru to appear in court and abide by the judgment.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Young Woman Accuses Husband of Abuse and Requests Separate Residence <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>One Week Given to Reconcile Out of Court</p>
<p>A young woman, Tang Zhou (also known as Zhou Guizhen), recently hired lawyer Lu Qi to file a lawsuit in the local court against her husband, Tang Wenhong (also known as Wenhong), claiming that living together was unbearable and requesting separate residence to avoid accidents and protect her integrity. Her statement essentially stated that in March of last year, she married the defendant through a matchmaker. Initially, the defendant pretended to be attentive and tried every means to accumulate her small savings because he saw she had some wealth. Later, he demanded clothing and jewelry, which he pawned and squandered. Eventually, when the money was gone, his love waned, and he began to give her cold looks every day. He soon became angry and frequently resorted to violence, treating her like an enemy. All of the plaintiff's clothing and cash had been pawned and squandered by the defendant. She had been repeatedly beaten and insulted, leaving her with scars all over her body. The marital relationship was almost like ice and charcoal. The relationship between husband and wife should be based on kindness and righteousness, and gender equality is clearly stipulated in the policies of the National Government. However, the defendant's treatment of the plaintiff has been one of abuse in every way, as described above, which not only goes against the original intention of the marriage but is also not tolerated by law and reason. For the sake of her own future, the plaintiff could have filed for divorce, but out of respect for etiquette and a reluctance to violate the principle of "remaining faithful from beginning to end," she has endured insults and made concessions in all matters. However, the defendant has taken this as an advantage and has instead driven the plaintiff back to her mother's home, neglecting her livelihood. Having no other choice, she entrusted a lawyer to send a letter to the defendant, proposing separate residence in order to preserve her safety. However, the defendant is cunning and stubborn and has ignored it. If the plaintiff were to live with him, not only would the abuse be unbearable, but the wicked mother-in-law would also assist in the abuse, making it even harder to be a wife. If the days were long and peaceful, her elderly mother's livelihood would be difficult, and she would not be able to continue living off her savings. Moreover, her mother is old and frail, and they depend on each other. In addition, the plaintiff is pregnant and awaiting childbirth, and funds are urgently needed. After much consideration, she has no choice but to seek justice and legal sanctions to ensure her survival. The defendant, Tang Wenhong, also hired lawyer Cai Jishi to present a defense, requesting to live together, claiming that the plaintiff had falsely accused him of abuse in an attempt to divorce. He stated that in March of last year, he married Zhou Guizhen, the daughter of Zhou Ziqin, through matchmakers such as Chen Kuilin, Tang Zhang, and others. After the marriage, the plaintiff could not endure the hard work of the old-fashioned family and complained at every turn. She was often extravagant and frequently went to amusement parks with her girlfriends. The defendant's monthly salary of twenty yuan was not enough to cover her expenses. His mother advised her, but she refused to change. His mother treated the plaintiff as if she were her own daughter, showering her with love and care, and there was no abuse. He requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed and that she be ordered to live together. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang held a hearing. The plaintiff, Tang Zhou, testified that she was twenty years old, from Wuxi, and living at her mother's home at No. 7 Siwei North Lane, Wangjiazhai Road, Zhabei. She also described the events that had occurred and claimed that the defendant had other women outside, which made it unbearable for her. The defendant, Tang Wenhong, testified that he was twenty-four years old, from Wuxi, and living at No. 10, Lane 2, Tianbao Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei. He worked at the Jiangxi Road Water Company and earned a monthly salary of twenty-four yuan. He claimed that the plaintiff's lawsuit was completely fabricated. The judge attempted to reconcile the parties in court, advising the plaintiff to live with the defendant. However, the plaintiff refused, so the judge advised the plaintiff to stay at the home of the defendant's relatives for a few days, and then live together again when both parties were calm. Both parties expressed their willingness to do so. However, the plaintiff specified that she wanted to stay at the home of the defendant's aunt in Suzhou for half a year and that she would be due to give birth in September of this year, requesting that the defendant pay her ten yuan per month for expenses. The defendant replied that he only earned a salary of twenty-four yuan per month and that even household expenses were sometimes insufficient, so he had no extra money to squander. He could only afford to pay one or two yuan per month. The judge repeatedly advised both parties, and as a result, the defendant agreed to pay nine yuan per month for six months. The judge was about to have the settlement record drawn up and have both parties sign it when the plaintiff suddenly raised five conditions: (1) The defendant must pay her ten yuan per month; (2) The defendant must return all of the plaintiff's clothes; (3) The defendant must redeem the plaintiff's clothes that he had pawned in the past; (4) The defendant must also redeem the gold jewelry that he had pawned, and return the plaintiff's private savings of over one hundred yuan; (5) If the defendant still abuses her, the plaintiff is allowed to file another lawsuit. The judge, finding the plaintiff unreasonable, ordered the lawyers of both parties to reconcile out of court. If they cannot reach a settlement within a week, another hearing will be held.</p>

<p>A Russian woman, Mi Gaofu, runs a brothel at No. 366 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. Yesterday morning around 1 AM, some Russians, including Xiao Fu, went there to seek pleasure and enticed the prostitute Na Lei to elope. They also smuggled her belongings out through the window. The madam discovered the situation and shouted for the police, who arrested them. The matter was not resolved until yesterday. Xiao Fu's brother, Ke, heard about the incident and, fearing that his younger brother would be imprisoned, drove his car from the French Concession to Qiujiang Road to investigate. However, he was driving too fast and injured a pedestrian, so he was also arrested.</p>

<p>Since the authorities of the Public Concession strictly prohibited prostitution, most of the Yangzhou brothels have relocated. As the French Concession has licenses available for the flower tax, the majority have moved there and continue their lives as prostitutes. The areas with the most brothels are the East and West Zilaihuo Streets, Caishi Street, Qianxin Street, and the vicinity of the Great World. Every night, after the electric lights are turned on, the various street corners and alley entrances are filled with women, all clamoring and crowding the streets. Their white faces and dark eyebrows are almost blinding. Pedestrians who pass through the area are often dragged and pulled by these women. If they encounter a naive person from the countryside, they will even carry the person into the brothel, forcing them to sit in a room and stay the night. Those who enter their doors must spend at least five or six small yuan or even one yuan before being released. Therefore, respectable businessmen avoid these areas at night. The Chamber of Commerce and other organizations have repeatedly sent letters to the police, requesting strict action. On the evening of the 25th, around 11 PM, a young man named Jia (approximately 20 years old), who had just arrived in Shanghai from the countryside, was wearing a flat-topped melon-skin satin hat, a blue bamboo cloth cotton robe, and a small western-style satin vest. He spoke with a Changshu accent and appeared to be a farmer from the countryside. He was walking on East Zilaihuo Street when he saw more than a dozen prostitutes from Ruifu Lane dragging and pulling customers in the middle of the road. Jia stopped to stare. The prostitutes, seeing that he was a country bumpkin, immediately went forward to drag him. Several prostitutes and pimps grabbed Jia's hands and lifted his feet, as if they were kidnapping him, intending to drag him inside. Jia was terrified and shouted for help. The prostitutes released him, and Jia, seeing that the prostitutes had let him go, ran out of the alley and into the street. Unfortunately, he bumped into a wonton stand parked at the entrance of the lane, causing it to overturn. All of the iron pots and bowls were smashed, and the wrapped wontons and fresh noodles were scattered everywhere. The owner of the stand grabbed Jia and demanded ten yuan in compensation. A large crowd gathered to watch. Jia, seeing that he had caused the accident, was terrified and his face turned pale. He only had one large yuan and twelve small yuan on him. The owner of the stand insisted on taking his clothes as collateral, but Jia refused, and tears streamed down his face. The onlookers, feeling sorry for him, criticized the prostitutes for dragging pedestrians, which had caused the accident. They ordered the prostitutes to pay three yuan and collected sixteen small yuan from the onlookers. Together with Jia's one large yuan and twelve small yuan, they gave it to the wonton vendor. A small commotion was finally settled. Jia, ashamed, headed south toward Shanghai.</p>

<p>Chen Keqing, a detective from the Fifth District of the Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau, reported to the French Concession police that the home of Wu Jinsheng, located in Dekang Lane, Fusheng Road, Zhabei, was robbed by several armed thieves on the 22nd of this month. The thieves made off with gold and silver jewelry, clothing, and cash before fleeing. After the robbery, the victim's family received a threatening letter demanding a loan of 150 yuan and specifying that the money be handed over behind the Great World. Otherwise, they would take drastic measures. Therefore, he came to request permission to send detectives to assist in the arrest. The police chief granted the request and immediately ordered detectives to assist in the investigation. They arrested Su Kuan, Wu Jie, and Li Dai on the spot and brought them to the police station. Yesterday, they were escorted to the French Court for questioning. The detective first reported the details of the case and submitted the official documents requesting a transfer for trial. The defendants' lawyer argued that the defendants were in a dispute with Wang and Guan over the unequal distribution of funds from a lottery ticket purchased jointly, which led to the argument. The defendants had not written any threatening letters and requested that the court investigate. The Western Police Chief then reported that the third defendant, Li Dai, was found with a lottery ticket on his person at the time of his arrest. The Chinese and Western judges ordered that the two defendants, Su Kuan and Wu Jie, be handed over to the detectives to be taken away for trial, and that Li Dai be remanded in custody pending further investigation.</p>

<p>An old woman, Sheng Weng, was riding a tram outside the Xiaodongmen in the French Concession when a thug named Zhang A'gen approached her and forcibly snatched a gold earring from her ear before fleeing. The woman shouted for help, and a detective who heard her rushed to the scene, caught Zhang with the stolen goods, and brought him to the police station. Yesterday, he was brought before the French Court for investigation. The plaintiff reported the details of the robbery, and Zhang confessed to the robbery. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Zhang to three months in prison in the Western jail, after which he would be permanently expelled from the Concession. The stolen goods were returned to the plaintiff.</p>

<p>Wu Yaodong, a patrol officer from the Sixth District, Third Precinct of the Caoh Jing District in Puxi, led police officers Bi Xiangquan, Jiang Tianlanpu, Chuan Guo, and Hao Minghui on patrol on the evening of the 10th of this month at approximately 10 PM. While patrolling near Dujiazhai, south of Zhengjiaqiao, about six li southwest of Caohejing Town, they apprehended two armed bandits, Lin Yusheng and Fang Jinshan. They also found three Mauser pistols, one handgun, and two ammunition belts (containing over a hundred rounds of ammunition) on the two bandits. They brought them back to the station. After a brief interrogation by Chief Liu, they prepared a report and submitted it to the City Public Security Bureau, which forwarded it to the court for trial. It has now been learned that Director Yuan, recognizing that Chief Liu Lun of the precinct had been effective in his supervision and meticulous in his work, and that the police officers had been alert and brave, found them highly commendable. Therefore, he ordered that Chief Liu Lun be given a major merit award and a bonus of 80 yuan, to be distributed fairly among the police officers according to their contributions, to encourage them. The seized firearms and ammunition were to be returned to the precinct for use. Chief Liu, upon receiving the order, prepared a document to claim the reward yesterday.</p>

<p>The General Post Office received instructions from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating: "For the information of all concerned, the case of the Railway Department requesting to send personnel to discuss and revise postal rates has been discussed. The result of the discussion is that the postal economy in our country is currently in a state of depletion, and it is inappropriate to increase its burden and hinder its development. However, once traffic in various regions returns to normal and postal operations can progress, the parcel rate will be revised first. Then, the issue of how to increase the freight rate will be jointly handled. In addition to replying, a copy of the reply is hereby issued for the General Post Office to note."</p>
<h3 id="e161">Director Pan Discusses Pharmaceutical Mediation Case <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Most Decisions Based on Legal Mediation</p>
<p>Those Who Disagree Can Apply for Arbitration</p>
<p>Although the pharmaceutical dispute has been mediated, it is not completely resolved. Hu Qingyu and Cai Tongde are still closed. A Wuchen News reporter interviewed Director Pan Gongzhan of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday and conducted the following interview: (Q) The pharmaceutical capitalists claim that this case was a biased decision by your bureau, is that true? (A) This case was initially about the employment of unemployed workers. Our bureau was ordered by the municipal government to mediate. Subsequently, the employees in the industry declared a strike, demanding that the capitalists hire more workers due to the heavy workload. Our bureau then legally convened a labor-capital mediation committee, which made an impartial decision. (Q) How is the mediation committee organized? (A) According to law, for each dispute, the government agency appoints one to three members, and the labor and capital sides each appoint two representatives. The mediation committee in this case was composed of one representative each from our bureau, the municipal party headquarters, and the Public Security Bureau, along with two representatives each from the labor and capital sides. (Q) The capitalists advertised that their representatives did not attend the meeting, can a decision be made in that case? (A) This case was formally mediated on the 21st with all members present. The capitalists' representatives, Zhuang Meitang and Zhang Zhihao, legally attended, but they insisted on their views regarding the hiring of additional workers. At 10 PM, no decision had been reached, and it was agreed to continue the meeting on the 24th to resolve the matter. All representatives signed the decision, including Zhuang and Zhang. Therefore, the mediation on the 24th was a continuation and not another meeting. Furthermore, the Pharmaceutical Association submitted a petition to our bureau on the 23rd, stating that the representatives of the association could only insist on the original agreement during tomorrow's mediation. It was resolved to stop sending representatives to attend and wait for the bureau's decision before applying for arbitration. Our bureau forwarded the original petition to the mediation committee for review. The mediation committee was a collegial body and made decisions based on majority vote. Since the original petition requested a decision and was prepared to apply for arbitration, a decision could be made with the consent of five members. Therefore, this decision was not inappropriate. However, since the capitalists' representatives did not sign, they could apply to the municipal government for arbitration within five days. The capitalists' representatives had already been nominated and reported, and their names could not be crossed out simply because they did not sign. The claim that this decision was a unilateral decision by our bureau is a fundamental misunderstanding. The Pharmaceutical Association's advertisement even stated that "there is no reason to request the bureau to make a prompt decision." It should be noted that the original petition from the association on the 23rd is on file, and there is no room for denial. (Q) How did your bureau handle the case after the mediation committee made a decision? (A) Our bureau believes that this case has been delayed for too long, affecting people's lives and public order. It is not appropriate for both sides to continue arguing. Therefore, we ordered the Pharmaceutical Association and the Workers' Union to comply with the decision and resume work and business on the 25th. We heard that Hu Qingyu and Cai Tongde have not yet reopened, and we have ordered them to comply. (Q) Does this decision conflict with the Central Party Headquarters' approval of the Pharmaceutical Qin Association and the municipal government's directive to prioritize the employment of unemployed workers? (A) The mediation committee is responsible for the decisions made. Those who disagree can apply for arbitration according to law, and the reasonableness of the decision will be determined by the arbitration ruling. However, according to my personal observation, the Central Party Headquarters' approval and the municipal government's directive consistently instructed pharmaceutical companies to find ways to prioritize the employment of these unemployed workers. This does not mean that pharmaceutical companies should not hire them at all. The terms "prioritize" and "find ways" show that the Central and Municipal Governments were concerned about the plight of unemployed workers and wanted to find ways to employ them first, even if it was impossible. Now that there are legal ways to do so, the reasons for the mediation decision are indeed based on this point. On the one hand, according to the survey, larger pharmacies have thriving businesses and slow dispensing, which necessitates hiring additional workers for the sake of patients. On the other hand, in accordance with the Central and Municipal Governments' intentions, pharmaceutical companies are responsible for prioritizing the employment of qualified unemployed workers. The people previously placed by the Workers' Union are treated separately, either employed or given severance pay and sent back to their hometowns. It seems that there is no conflict. In all fairness, Chinese pharmacies are often too busy, and dispensing is delayed for three or four hours, which is common. Most patients feel this pain. Adding workers to remedy this would be what society hopes for.</p>

<p>The various vendor, broker, and boat merchant groups in this city, after the Central Government clearly ordered that there was no need to organize groups, formed a joint organization office to fight for organization to the competent authorities, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the office held its fifth representative meeting, attended by fifty representatives, chaired by Wang Yankang.

<p>Blind Man Out of Luck</p>
<p>Qian Heming, a man from Pudong, is forty-two years old and has been blind since childhood. Therefore, he learned fortune-telling to support himself. He also set up a fortune-telling shop at No. 21 Zixia Road, outside the Dadongmen, and his business was doing well. Yesterday afternoon around 3 PM, a man named Jia came to Qian's shop and claimed to be a salesman in a rice shop, selling rice to him. If he wanted it, the price could be cheaper. Qian, seeing that his family's rice was running out, negotiated a price with Jia and ordered one dan of rice. Jia hurriedly left and then went to the Cuichunxiang Rice Shop in Gaoxiangtou, outside the Xiaonanmen, and said that he lived at No. 21 Zixia Road and asked them to send one dan of white rice immediately, saying that he would take them there and pay the rice price after it was delivered. The shop did not doubt him and sent a porter, Cai Yaodong, to deliver the rice, following Jia to the address. Jia told Qian that the rice had arrived. Qian, hearing this, ordered the porter to pour the rice into the rice jar and then handed 19 yuan to Jia for the rice. Jia suddenly had an idea and asked the porter to send another dan of rice from the shop to the same place, saying that the rice price could be calculated together. Cai agreed and returned to the shop, sending another dan of rice to the same place. However, Jia was no longer there. So he delivered the rice to Qian. At this time, Qian was very surprised and said that he only needed one dan of rice, why send two? Cai said that if the rice sent later was not needed, it could be returned, but the price of the one dan of rice sent earlier should be paid to him. Qian found the matter even more strange and loudly said that the rice money had already been taken by your salesman. Cai said that there was no salesman in his shop and accused Qian of deliberately denying the rice money. Therefore, they disagreed and had a big conflict. Huang Xiaokun, the guard of the 14th post, heard about it and rushed to the scene, inquired about the situation, and brought them both back to the First District Headquarters. They were ordered to be detained temporarily pending investigation and preliminary examination.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Resignation of Dock Supervisor <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Linhe, a Chinese employee in charge of the Zhanghuabang Haikai River Dock Office in Songnan, is 59 years old and a native of Zhanghuabang. He entered customs at the age of 22 and has been there for 37 years. He is very familiar with managing the flag raising, navigation of ships, and security matters at Gaoqiao, Zhanghuabang, Paotaiwan, and Bailonggang in Pudong. He is also proficient in English and highly respected by successive Deputy River Dock Commissioners. He has gained considerable insights into the research of various scales regarding ship routes, tides, and storms. He also had two exclusive duties: (1) Based on years of experience, he could detect the arrival of hurricanes several hours before a storm broke out. Upon detection, he would immediately report to the Shanghai River Dock Office via telephone, notifying all flag stations along the Yangtze River to raise storm warning signals, warning ships en route to avoid danger. (2) He calculated the tidal ebb and flow chart for the solar calendar based on the lunar calendar from years of experience (Western name: "Tide Table"). This chart had to be prepared and sent to Shanghai one month in advance. For example, information such as the ebb and flow times and scale changes for each day from May 1st to the end of May had to be sent in mid-April so that the Customs, River Dock Office, and shipowners could consult it and have a grasp of the situation. Now, Mr. Zhou has submitted his resignation due to the Customs regulations stipulating a service period of only 35 years, which he has exceeded. It has been approved and will take effect on April 1st.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the National Government in Guangzhou on July 1, 1925, a considerable number of laws have been created and revised over the past five years. Although books such as "Complete Collection of Laws and Regulations" and "Compilation of Laws and Regulations" have been published in the market, they mostly focus on administrative laws and regulations and are difficult for legal professionals to consult. In order to ensure that the people of the country understand the law and to facilitate the participation of legal professionals in government affairs, the Judicial Yuan of the National Government has specially compiled a book titled "Judicial Regulations of the National Government." All currently effective judicial laws, regulations, orders, and explanatory documents have been included without omission. The contents are divided into ten categories: Party Affairs, Official System, Official Regulations, Trial, Civil, Criminal, Administrative, Laws and Regulations, Judicial Administration, Foreign Affairs, and Miscellaneous Records, with further detailed chapters. The system is detailed and the printing is exquisite. The entire book consists of two volumes, totaling over 2,000 pages, and is priced at six yuan, plus four jiao for postage for outside areas. It is now being sold by the Gazette Office of the Secretariat of the Judicial Yuan. Those who want to understand the law must have a copy at hand.</p>

<p>In 1920, the Commercial Press compiled and printed the "Sibu Congkan." Because good editions of the official histories were not available, they were omitted. For more than ten years, extensive efforts have been made to find them. Except for the "History of Yuan," which used the Ming edition, and the "History of Ming," which used the Qing edition, old Song and Yuan editions have been collected for the rest, named "Hundred Patch Edition of the Twenty-Four Histories" to correct many errors and omissions in the palace edition. It is reported that ancient editions of various histories have been collected by the publishing house, and samples have been produced. Pre-orders will begin in early next month and the photo-printed edition will be published.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 3 p.m., the Jinhua Electric Silk Weaving Factory on Wuhua Road held a shareholders' meeting. After the formalities were completed, manager Huang Yisan reported on the factory's operations and future plans for reorganizing production and promoting domestic and foreign business. It was resolved that since the government of French Vietnam had violated the treaty and increased the tax on Chinese silk imported to Vietnam from 0.07 to 0.50, resulting in the suspension of Chinese silk exports to Vietnam, and given that it is currently a time of high demand for silk goods, if this issue is not resolved soon, it will have a significant impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. It was further resolved that the chamber should send a telegram to the government, instructing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seriously negotiate with the French ambassador regarding the Vietnamese government's breach of contract by increasing the tax on Chinese silk, so that it can be cancelled as soon as possible to relieve the plight of Jiangsu merchants, and so on.

<p>British-American Tobacco Workers' Union: Sent a telegram to express condolences to the workers of the British-American Tobacco Factory in Qingdao, which reads: "To the entire Executive Committee of the Qingdao British-American Tobacco Factory Union, via the Qingdao General Labor Union: We have read in the newspaper that Cao Yunxiang, advisor to the Shanghai British-American Tobacco Factory, went to Qingdao and, after negotiating with the factory owner, decided to suddenly suspend work starting on the 19th. We are extremely indignant upon hearing this. According to previous reports, your union workers demanded that the factory increase wages, with male workers receiving an increase of two jiao and female workers receiving an increase of one jiao. After struggling, you finally won. However, not long after, troubles have arisen again. It is understandable that imperialist capitalists oppress workers, but Cao Yunxiang's decision to suspend the factory and resist the workers is an act of servility and a willingness to please foreigners, which is inexcusable. Cao was known for instigating animosity between labor and management and undermining the labor movement when he was at the Shanghai factory. We have previously warned him on record. However, he dares to continue his evil ways and is now oppressing our Qingdao factory workers with bloody hands. His reactionary intentions are not only condemned by the people of the country but are also intolerable to nature. Our union shares the same cause and feels the pain together. We cannot stand idly by. In addition to leading more than 8,000 workers to support your union and severely warning Cao Yunxiang, we are sending this telegram to express our condolences. We hope that your union will uphold the fearless spirit of the General Manager, strive to fight against evil forces, and be assured of ultimate victory. Please provide us with the true situation so that we can provide support. We eagerly await your response."</p>

<p>— Zhang Juping</p>
<p>There are countless kinds of snakes, all wonderfully strange. However, they are mostly found in the humid and hot areas of the south. In our Suzhou area, they are quite simple. The villagers are familiar with and can name only three kinds: the green whip snake, the red-banded snake, and the earth viper. The red-banded snake and the earth viper are both viviparous and highly venomous, especially the earth viper. Those bitten by it often face life-threatening danger if not treated properly. The green whip snake, on the other hand, is oviparous and has very little venom. Initially, the bite also causes redness, swelling, and pain, but it subsides the next day and does not cause harm. This snake has the characteristic of living in people's houses. It can use spaces under the floorboards, between walls, and under tiles as its burrows. Because its body has protection, it does not come into contact with wind, sun, rain, or dew. Its green exterior gradually turns into a dull grayish-white. Also, because it is accustomed to living with people, it loses its inherent fear and often appears calmly in front of people. Villagers call it the "house-guarding snake" and bless it with good intentions, not daring to kill it, believing that killing it will bring great disaster. This is simply due to superstition.</p>
<p>Years ago, my family demolished an old, long-abandoned stove. Inside the stove, we found more than a dozen snake eggs. The snakes had already hatched and left, leaving only the eggshells. The quality of the shells was different from ordinary chicken and duck eggs. They were soft and pliable, much like silkworm cocoons, and were also made up of fine threads, but more loosely woven. The most peculiar thing was that the dozen or so eggs were naturally connected in a string. Each egg was separated from the others by two or three fen (a unit of length). A tube as thick as a reed stem was attached between them. The tube was hollow and connected to the egg, and its material was the same as the eggshell. Examining the entire structure, it was seamless. Only the top of the first egg had a small hole. Presumably, the dozen or so small snakes emerged from this hole, and the tubes were their passageways. Such a strange egg shape is indeed unique among living things.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been working at the Shipping Association. During the long, boring nights, I often chat with the tea server, Bingchang. Bingchang is from Nantong. He said that in his hometown, a farmer named Jia woke up one morning to use the toilet. He saw something wriggling next to the toilet. Upon closer inspection, it was a snake. The front part of its body was already in a crack in the wall, leaving only its tail exposed. It was about a foot long. Jia quickly grabbed and pulled it, but it wouldn't move. He exerted more force, and it suddenly snapped in two. Jia threw the tail away and told his family. This eventually reached the ears of a neighbor, an old man, who came over and said to Jia, "If a snake is cut off above the third segment of its tail, it will inevitably die soon, even if it manages to escape at the time. However, if it is cut off below the third segment, it can still live and its venom will be ten times that of a normal snake, and it will seek revenge. Let's go take a look." Jia then showed him the snake's tail. The old man said, "Oh, it's only two segments. It certainly won't die. You should be prepared from now on." Jia was worried upon hearing this and was constantly on guard. After four or five years, nothing happened, and his mind was somewhat at ease. One night, just as he was going to bed, he tucked his mosquito net tightly under the quilt, also as a precaution against snakes. Unexpectedly, a tiny slit opened up in the top of the net. A snake somehow squeezed through the slit. Its whole body had passed through, but the severed end had formed a fleshy ball that could not fit through the slit, putting it in a bind. It flailed wildly. Jia woke up in surprise. Upon realizing that it was a snake, he prepared to wait. After a long time, it did not come down. He looked outside the net and saw the fleshy ball. He then knew that the snake was helpless. Taking advantage of its being suspended in the air, it died. This is because snakes can only move forward and cannot retreat.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Anecdotes from the Wedding of Zeng Yangfu and Feng Xiaoyun <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Lichen</p>
<p>The wedding of Zeng Yangfu, Deputy Director of the Construction Committee, and Miss Feng Xiaoyun, sister of Feng Yifei, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Central Military Training Corps, was held at 4:00 p.m. on the 22nd at the auditorium of the Capital Artillery Standard Lizhi Society. It was a grand occasion. Here are some interesting details:</p>
<p>Perfect Arrangement: Both parties appointed responsible personnel in advance to arrange everything at the Lizhi Society. The auditorium was filled with congratulatory banners and couplets. A ceremonial table was set up on the stage, and flower baskets were placed densely. The exterior of the hall was also covered with colorful cloth, which was eye-catching. Other facilities such as the newlyweds' rest room and the guests' rest room were all prepared. Someone said, "The groom is the Deputy Director of the Construction Committee. This arrangement is only the smallest part of the construction. In the future, the two parties will cooperate, and the results of the construction will be considerable." Everyone who heard this applauded.</p>
<p>Interesting Congratulatory Messages: Banners were the most numerous among the gifts, numbering about hundreds. The inscriptions were all pedantic. Only "Yu Bailing, Building the Foundation" was relatively relevant. Among them, Chen Guofu's congratulatory message was the most interesting. It is recorded below. "Construction is difficult, and marrying a wife is even more difficult. Yangfu has come to this day after planning for ten years. I was entrusted to be the matchmaker, searching everywhere but finding no suitable match. Limited to girls from Suzhou and Huzhou, their physiques were incompatible. Their temperaments were gentle and their faces were beautiful. Their character and learning had to be high. With all the appropriate conditions met, how could there be a lady who could match this man? Today, I entrusted friends, and tomorrow, I'll search myself. From Tianjin, I searched to America. From America, I turned back. Guangzhou for several months yielded nothing. Nanjing and Shanghai were fruitless. Joining the army and the Northern Expedition were in vain. Returning from Pingjin, I only sighed. The days passed by. Helplessly, the matchmakers were all ineffective. Liver fire raged, and the stomach was ill. Groaning on the bed, the doctor advised to start a family early. I asked my old mother and consulted with friends, redoubling my efforts, and finally achieved today's marriage. Originally, Miss Feng Xiaoyun's talent was commensurate, as passionate as Yangfu. Regretting meeting too late, ambitions are finally achieved. Respecting and loving each other, no need to talk about any clauses. Once it's decided, there's no need to ask God's permission. Love is originally an electrical attraction. Marriage is for building a new family. A new family, just created, should set an example of thrift. Believe that human effort is omnipotent. Let's all raise a glass and congratulate this happy couple." The language was extremely humorous and interesting, a unique approach to congratulatory messages. Zhang Wuhua's couplet was "Golden fortune unites hearts, good to take advantage of the spring breeze to create a marriage contract. The society can inspire ambition, elegant to abstain from the dawn and cock crow." The local scenery also contained elegance and fun. Dai Jitao's double happiness character, written on Panlong paper, decorated with a gold-edged frame, was truly a special feature.</p>
<p>Venerable Wu's Admonition: Venerable Wu and Zhang Jingjiang were both the officiants. Venerable Wu delivered the admonition, mainly saying that Comrade Yangfu had been working for the revolution for many years and had recently been striving for construction. It was heard that the newlyweds Yangfu would take a honeymoon to the United States to study construction work. Congratulations, congratulations. He also hoped that they would work hard to build their family and have many descendants.</p>
<p>Director Feng's Embarrassment: Feng Yifei wore a military uniform and the Baoding Medal, escorting his sister into the auditorium with small, piano-like steps. Feng was not used to it and was greatly embarrassed. Feng had once served as the commander of the 22nd Route Army and was usually lively and brave when commanding soldiers. Now, being suddenly restrained in this way, it was no wonder that his face was red. The observers even called out "The Director is embarrassed!", which made Feng even more uneasy.</p>

<p>Mei Lanfang's Portrait in the New York Evening Post</p>
<p>Before Wan Hua went to America, many people were worried for him. However, I knew that the American reception depended entirely on the effectiveness of the publicity. If Americans could vigorously promote him, all kinds of difficulties could be easily solved. And now it has come true. A friend sent me a large bundle of news about Mr. Mei from New York. Among them were lengthy articles, a dazzling array. The newspapers included the New York Evening Post, the New York Times, the New York Sun, and the New York Public Opinion Post. I will make the effort to abridge and translate these articles to satisfy readers. I believe that not only theater enthusiasts will have the pleasure of seeing them first, but also those who care about national affairs will be pleased to see the foreigners' comments on the excellence of Chinese art.</p>
<p>Mr. Shirwin, a reporter for the New York Evening Post, wrote a long article. I will excerpt and translate the following: (The following is an overview of the essay)</p>
<p>Judging from the enthusiastic applause of the audience at the Forty-Ninth Street Theater last night, I predict that the entire city of New York will soon be overwhelmed by a craze for the Chinese people and Chinese things. Therefore, I dare to bet all that I have and assert that the most curious people in New York will abandon their black nightclubs and turn to worship Eastern art. At the same time, there will also be a large number of half-baked, pretentious, and self-proclaimed Chinese scholars appearing in the halls of hotels.</p>
<p>This further proves that publicity in theaters, if properly executed, will be one of the most surprising forms of international propaganda.</p>
<p>Isn't it even more credible that the American Chinese Society invited Mr. Mei to come here? I also know that within a week, people in New York will be talking about the Chinese and Chinese things, arousing our sympathy for the Chinese to an incredible degree. This kind of craze has swept the city several times before. The Spanish once, the blacks again, and now it is the era of the Chinese.</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>André Derain (2)</p>
<p>Since the end of the European War, he has often studied the works of the great masters of the past in the Louvre. Towards their passionate paintings, he gradually became fond of Renoir's precise structure and Corot's lyrical genius. All other aspects of Corot were also appreciated by him. The so-called poetry, feeling, freshness, and stability of method. However, the entire Louvre was very intimate to Derain. Chardin and his still lifes, Claude Lorrain and his trees, Rubens' roughness, Courbet and Manet's interesting whites, the spirit of light and all the dazzling fantasies, all the artificial "light and dark", all the brave and noble Arabian styles. This kind of resource, classified in a dictatorial way, enabled him to rediscover the objective world. Renoir's sensual, trembling women, the gorgeous background arrangements, the vivid landscapes, and the enchanting colors, in short, that power of life written with noble sources. His reddish-brown and emerald green palette provided some workable oiliness, which displayed the immortal traces of his delicate backgrounds and gorgeous foregrounds. This is a synthesis of all charms. It flows out casually, making his art so sympathetic.</p>
<p>Derain is a learned figure. The rationale he practices can generally be said to be Esoteric (secretly transmitted). The paintings of past masters are all inexplicable secrets in his eyes. In fact, in his view, art is nothing more than the mystery of "great" "power". His curiosity is always eager to move, continuing his impassioned exploration. Those who only seek in his works a ridiculous imitation of the traces of the masters' paintings will ridicule him and despise him. There are still many people who are moved by the alluring solemnity on his canvases and express great respect for him. Derain is a mystic, a sensualist, and a refined intellectual due to his multifaceted talents and characteristics. He likes to discuss all human knowledge and some of the most vague and unclear difficult problems. I have rarely seen a painter who is as gluttonous for knowledge as he is. There is nothing in poetry and music that he does not want to swallow in one gulp. He is especially infatuated with all the philosophy of painting.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, we can best prove it by quoting his conversation with André Breton. This conversation is published in "The Ideas of a Painter" (Idees dun peintre).</p>
<p>One should intimately understand the inner heart of what one paints. It is meaningless to paint forms for the sake of forms. When I talk to a person, how do I know what kind of form this person is? What I pay attention to is only the expression of his features to me. Only this can give me the impression of life. A person's uniqueness certainly exists. — People who can't hear clearly, no matter how big their earlobes are, it is useless. — Painting cannot exclusively seek likeness. Form must be expressed from the aspect of cultivation. There is nothing to explore outside the features. The same rules apply to animals and plants. The life of a tree is a mystery. No painter can succeed without penetrating its inner heart. Perhaps only Henri Rousseau was ever worried about this. But he still valued the leaves too much, which damaged the whole. We often see in the market people selling a kind of iron wire puzzle, asking people to release a ring from this puzzle. This is exactly the same as the problem of the life of a tree. — Only those who can capture the life of a tree are successful painters. — The problem of the life of inanimate objects is the same. Who can think that he can capture the "movement" of a material? (Immobility is equal to absolute movement). Everything that falls before my senses has its use for me. What is not completely adopted by me must be immature and false....</p>

<h3 id="e181">Finance - Gold Price Exceeds Five Hundred Taels <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Increased by Three Taels and Seven Mace</p>
<p>No Drastic Change</p>
<p>Benefiting from the boost of silver prices and foreign exchange, yesterday, the 26th, the gold standard frequently contracted due to large bars and foreign exchange rates being one level lower, so it reached a new high, already breaking through the 500 tael mark. However, the market situation did not change too drastically. The front market only had a difference of two taels of change, and the later market was even more stable, hovering around 500 taels. Trading among peers was still considered agile. Fuchang Yuanheng Yu Da and others all bought in, while Hengxing Wanxing Shunli and others sold short positions. It opened high from the morning, and then rotated slightly, but the exchange rate was very strong. There was something to settle in the industry, and the buyers in the market were particularly strong, even rising above 501 taels. However, the Guangdong group and others were quite inclined to sell off, and now it has depreciated by two taels. Afterwards, the exchange rate became stable again, and the buyers were not tired, so they raised it by more than one tael. By the time the Wanxing Shunli in the later market still belonged to sales, Hengxing re-entered, Yu Da Juchang pursued, and the market was initially soft and then brisk, but only fluctuated by one tael.

Sumitomo sold June US dollars for 47 yuan 375, and also sold British gold for 11 pence 375. Then Mitsui and China Bank absorbed 3125, and then China Bank mutually traded 375, and the Dalian group sold a lot, so it depreciated by more than one tael, calculated between 99 taels The first order issued has been contracted by two or five, half a yuan in US dollars, and one fen and one two five in Japanese gold, so it has risen to 99 taels and 67 qian. Then the June US dollar silver price mutually traded 47 yuan and a half to 47 yuan and 3125, and Mitsui issued one tael, zero four fen and 875 for the June Japanese gold. There were many buyers on the table, the bars were dry, and Reuters News Agency reported that the US and Japan had added 0.0625, and the UK and Japan added 0.03125, so it jumped two taels to ten o'clock and had exceeded the 500 tael mark. At ten and a half o'clock it was 501 taels and five qian. Afterwards, the sellers were active, slightly thwarting one tael, but the Japanese gold had also turned wider, and Hua Bi and others issued one tael, zero four fen and 625 in June, and the same industry mutually traded one tael, zero four fen and 625. After eleven o'clock, it continued to unload four or so, and at half past eleven it was 499 taels and 56 qian, and suddenly the empty side purchased and added more than one tael, which was 501 taels, but the closing price was calculated as 500 taels and 0.04 qian.</p>

Soon after, Dadecheng and Hengxing and others purchased, and because the exchange rate was high, people's hearts were easy to rise, and suddenly raised one tael, to 2:30 pm it was 501 taels, but it was Wednesday, and there was a lack of market for foreign exchange. Around 3 o'clock, zero households sold out, slightly suppressing six or seven qian, calculated as 500 taels and 0.034 qian. Then it was mediocre, until the market was about to close, Yu Da, Yifeng Yong, and others all had their hands down to pursue, so at 4:20 pm it was calculated as 501 taels to close the market, which was a three tael and seven qian increase compared to the day before.

<h3 id="e184">Cash Foreign Currency Sales and Digestion Gradually Smooth <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview Recently, in terms of the current situation, there have been military operations again, and the sales of military needs for foreign currencies seem to be active. The purchase and digestion of the North and South groups are quite lively. Only because the Shanghai storage is quite abundant, the movement of one or two million has no great impact, so the price difference is slightly better than the previous day. As for the bank's buying and selling, it is not very brave. Fortunately, the current forward foreign currency is not done, so it will definitely not have any impact on the price difference. In terms of money supply, because the supply and demand sides are very lazy, the market atmosphere is calm, and the financial industry's business has a trend of going downhill.</p>
<p>Difference Discount Price (Foreign Interest) Because customers have a purchase digestion in the morning, the market atmosphere is quite good, and the interest price is quite outstanding. The closing price is seven qian, two fen, zero half interest, which is three hao and seven忽and a half higher than the early market the day before. In the afternoon, the situation was stagnant, there were not many transactions, and no one disputed the price, so the closing price was the same as the early market price. (Silver Discount) In both the early and afternoon markets, the discount ticket transfers were all old accounts, and there were very few new transactions, so the market price remained the same. Both markets opened three points, and the bank's payment was still abundant, so it remained white throughout.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Market Situation Jiangnan Small Foreign Currency The transaction is inherently limited, but recently, due to the slack of both supply and demand, the price in the early and afternoon markets has not changed in the slightest. It is calculated that the same is six qian, one fen, six interest and two hao and a half, and the transaction volume is only 3,000 angles in the early market, and there is no transaction at all in the afternoon market. Guangdong Small Foreign Currency, the early market is five qian, nine fen and six interest and a half, and the afternoon market is six interest and eight hao and seven 忽, which is the same as the afternoon market the day before. The transaction volume is 115,000 angles in the early market and 90,000 angles in the afternoon market. The copper yuan has not changed, still 391,500 wen.</p>

Qianzhuang and Silver Public collected and released more than 26.6 million,划头款collected and released more than 3.2 million, various remittance款collected and released more than 1.2 million, and collected 890,000 in cash.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency In and Out The exchange of tickets made 1.42 million in the early market, but very few in the afternoon, only 425,000, a decrease of 1 million compared to the early market, which shows the opposite situation of early prosperity and afternoon decline, which is also rare in peacetime. 25,000 banknotes in the early market, and no transaction in the afternoon. 68,000 banknotes outside the market in the early market, and 48,000 in the afternoon. 135,000 in cash foreign currency in the early market, and 60,000 in the afternoon.

The total turnover for the day was more than 6.7 million yuan, of which tariffs accounted for more than 2.9 million yuan, post-settlement accounted for about 1.4 million yuan, disbandment trading also reached 1.1 million yuan, and others were relatively idle.

Post-settlement continued to卷, also rising by several yuan. The others were raised by six or seven angles. The Securities Exchange will start auctioning new transactions in May futures starting today, it is said.</p>

<p>The yarn market is calm, and the overall situation does not deviate from the state of hovering. The actual sales and digestion in the market have not been smooth. However, the intentions of the Qingdao and Sichuan groups are still good, but the seller's thinking is extremely low, because there is too much stagnant goods accumulation, and it is not easy to sell it at once. Moreover, at the time of the order deadline, the situation is precarious, so there are more people watching the decline. As for those outside the industry in the distant months, they are tightened and not released, because their foundation is very small and it is possible to do more, so the two sides hold very firmly. This month, the bulls see the overall situation as bad and sell out all of them, but the shorts buy in and collect the goods, and the market atmosphere is temporarily stable, it is said.</p>
<p>The "Man Label" (Rén Biāo) Hovers All Day In the early market of the "Man Label", the near month was very tired, falling by six qian due to sufficient delivery, and the long month was flat, not moving two or three discs. The market situation was slightly firm. As a result, the near fell five qian, and the far was flat. In the afternoon, there was a partial short covering. The shorts in the current month bought in and collected the goods, and the market disc slightly rose by three to five qian, and the far rose by one qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 17,200 bales. The closing prices of the "Man Label" are recorded on the left.</p>

It is found that the statistics of spot and futures goods bought by various groups for the whole day are 1,640 bales. 800 bales were purchased by peers. The market is flat. Customers and the Sichuan group had the strongest purchase and digestion, calculated as 350 bales. In addition, Xuzhou 385 bales, the mainland 115 bales, Gaoyang 100 bales, Hankou 45 bales, Qingdao 350 bales, Changsha 100 bales, Yantai 70 bales, and miscellaneous groups 125 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market is still calm, which is good because US cotton is stable, so there is still a lack of new sellers. The Han group tightens and does not release, and the situation is very strong. Retail investors are short covering. However, the last day of the current month means that many retail bulls expect a good price for the final disc. How could they know that there was a lack of buyers and a sudden crash of seven and a half qian. This situation is rare in the cotton market.</p>
<p>Han Standard Near Fall Far Flat In the early market, because foreign cotton was firm, the selling was calm, and the situation was relatively strong. The various months rose from five fen to one qian. The afternoon market opened and the market atmosphere was still tight.

<h3 id="e191">Grains: Rice Market Continues to Rise Unabated <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, around ten ships arrived from the inland. Market buying interest was somewhat subdued, but inventory along the river was reduced. Sentiment in neighboring markets was extremely positive. Northern粳(jīng) rice prices were firming. The price of medium-grade 粳 rice has risen beyond its level. Dealers' appetite was weak, because they are afraid to buy too much in this unprecedented market situation. However, those with insufficient inventory are defending against further price increases, and are aggressively buying. Therefore, current ordinary medium-grade Zhong-Guan 粳 rice is already reaching 19.5 to 20 yuan. Top-grade 粳 rice is already at the 21 yuan mark. People's livelihood is difficult to the extreme. The trend for Bo-Dao rice is firm, with limited trading. High-quality Yang-Du 籼(xiān) rice is offered at 18 yuan, but no goods have arrived at the port. Various gangs are paying close attention to foreign rice. Therefore, the situation for various 籼 rice is no less than that of 粳 rice. Bai-Yuan rice sales are being watched, and prices are stable.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Slightly more goods have arrived from the river. Local sales remain brisk. Various Chang-Su-Ji 粳 rice are experiencing continuous price increases due to strong sales. Furthermore, the future supply is uncertain, so the overall market is extremely good. Top-grade rice is offered at around 20 yuan. Bo-Dao rice from Nan-Lu Qing-Jiao and Si-Jing, etc., has not seen development. Buyers are particularly concerned. Prices are similar to the previous market. Customer appetite for Yang 籼 rice is very strong, and sellers are observing the market before selling. The amount of Du-Jian rice stored here is still considerable, and sellers are hoarding to raise prices. Therefore, the overall market for various 籼 rice is rising. Bai-Yuan rice sales are slowly improving. Buyers are urgently requesting goods. Yin-Yuan sales are still slow. The local inventory is considerable, so the market for various Bai-Yuan rice remains mediocre and difficult to prosper in the near term.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Flour Market: Weak Morning, Rebound Afternoon <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for various months of foreign wheat reports retreated slightly, about 7-8 jiao. Therefore, speculators in the heat of the market inevitably observed slightly. March, April and May were mostly hovering around the middle, showing a slight weak trend. Deferred months, due to outside long positions, had a slight pull back. Compared with the previous day, it retraced about 1 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, the near and deferred months rebounded again. It was vaguely heard that the long side did not pay attention to this month because there were only a few days left. The competition for April will inevitably be fierce, with outside short sales exceeding the selling of small and medium factories, while large factories stood by and watched, unwilling to participate in either side. In this situation, if the shorts do not cover, they may eventually be squeezed by the longs, and the irregular market will be created from this. For June, July and August, because large factories did not sell and inland gangs had good intentions, the rebound was very strong. As a result, this month was 2.5 li higher than the previous day, April was 2.5 li lower, June was 7.5 li higher, and May, July and August were 2.5 li higher.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Rice Prices Rise Daily, Wheat Market Difficult to Be Small <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market showed a trend of flat near and firm far. Because there is only one day left before delivery this month, the number of long and short closures is small. It is heard that the total number of deliveries this month is about 70 cars. At present, more than 50 cars have been approved by the exchange, and more than 20 cars are being inspected. The fairness of the market and the strength of the long and short sides can be seen from this. Although the weather is very good for deferred new goods and foreign wheat reports are small, people are always optimistic because of the daily rise in rice prices. All Wuxi gangs are doing long, and even inland factories are also purchasing. Therefore, the prices of each month are rising step by step. As a result, March and April are similar to the previous day, June is 1.7 fen higher than the previous month, and August is 2 fen higher. Spot wheat is still stable. Kai Wang-Jiang-Pu wheat is 5 taels and 1 qian, Yao-Wan wheat is 5 taels 1 qian 2 fen, Anqing wheat is 5 taels and 2 fen, 4 taels 9 qian 4 fen, Jiangxi wheat is 5 taels and 3 fen, to 1 fen, a total of 3,000 bags, handled by Shen Da Fu Feng.</p>

<p>Our Factory Cotton Cloth: Yesterday, fine cloth rose again, with a trend of getting higher and higher. In fact, dyed cloth sales are unusually smooth, and factory shipments cannot meet demand. In addition, factories in Tianjin and Guangdong are directly transporting large quantities, which has further fueled market sentiment. Yesterday, La-Ba, Tong-Cai-Qiu, and Yang-He all rose 2.5 fen. The need for Four Armies and Sichuan gangs is extremely urgent, and they are also rising sharply. Yesterday, it opened at 6 taels 8 qian 5 fen. Blue Chicken and Ji-Xiang spot goods are still out of stock, and the trend of fine twill is also strong. However, coarse cloth is still lifeless, and all gangs have no wholesale purchases. 11-pound cloth and 9-pound cloth are getting worse and worse. Coarse twill is even more sluggish. Yesterday, only Jian gang had a slight transaction.</p>
<p>East and West Piece Goods: Market conditions are generally stable. Local sales are still active. The slackness of Hankou, Sichuan and other gangs on the customer side is truly rare. Therefore, the rapid rise of the Eastern exchange rate, the high cost of inventory, and the price of goods are still difficult to turn around. That is why. Yesterday, Dong goods, Yuan foreign yarn sales were quite smooth. Ningbo and Shantou gangs traded more than 100 pieces. Zijin Mountain was 8 taels, Dian Qiuxiang 8 taels 2 qian, white crepe has arrived in Shanghai one after another, Ren Gou and Tong Pen are sold for 3 taels 5 fen, printed cloth is 3 taels 2 qian, 14-pound fine cloth is greatly out of stock, Signal Corps is 8 taels 7 qian 5 fen, there is still no spot goods, Yue Yan also needs 8 taels 7 qian, floral cloth is still soft, fine bi-ji, Zhigong satin, and Zhigong ni have not changed much. Western goods, white bleached ramie yarn, blue striped ramie yarn all fell yesterday, due to the impact of the unsettled situation, striped Fu-Chou is also slightly soft.</p>

<p>— Guang Mei</p>
<p>The beautiful goddess of spring, with a smile, brought countless gods, happily descended to earth to meet us. Let's not say that everyone is welcoming with joy and excitement. Even the affectionate birds and lovely flowers and trees, aren't they desperately playing with their clever tongues like reeds and strings, vying to spit out their painted and embroidered leaves and pistils. The fluffy fragrant grass, without any hesitation, has woven the vast earth into a pleasing green carpet. The whole world has transformed into a landscape of brocade and embroidery. Ah, whose gift, whose giving, how can we not thank the goddess of spring for bestowing on us - all things with infinite life,</p>
<p>Spring light is routinely scattered on Jiangwan Road. Here there are the intriguing Hongkou Park, 63 Garden and swimming pool, etc. But we should understand that these, these, are all made by our fellow countrymen themselves. They are completely blessed by the foreign masters. Whenever we enjoy these ready-made blessings, we will think of the so-called "park", which is only public to the public. It is pitiful for a group of poor compatriots to taste what the word "public" really means. Although those who can afford to visit the park are not all rich people, they still can't enter without two "Maozi" in their pockets, no matter how much face you have.</p>
<p>Why not, when there are no classes at eight o'clock in the morning, happily go to Jiangwan Road, as smooth as a dance hall, to explore the news of spring. You can see groups of three or five foreign children, carrying schoolbags, as beautiful as flowers, as lively as sparrows, skipping past you "jilugulu", until they turn the corner and are out of sight. Then there are more than sixty members of the running team, bare-legged, no, just a small garment like a swimsuit, full of the vitality of spring, running bravely forward. I, who visited for the first time, was thinking in a daze, I wonder which school this group of athletes is from, oh, or maybe they are from Chi-Zhi. Time does not allow me to think further, they have already sped past me like flying. It turned out to be blue-eyed and yellow-haired gentlemen, ah, their bodies are indeed worthy of being called full of "strength" and "beauty", and it is not an exaggeration to say that the development of their chests is even more impressive than that of our virgins. At that time, I disrespectfully gave birth to a feeling of jealousy towards them. From time to time, you can see the wooden clogs of our close friends, leading a number of small</p>

<p>students, passing through Jiangwan Road. Presumably, they are going to the countryside for a spring outing. Although they are not wearing uniform uniforms, their country's specialty cloth, red and green, is more attractive than school uniforms, and especially the female teachers walking on both sides, I love the beauty of their buns, their bodies as graceful as jade. This is when I praised those Japanese beauties in Hongkou Park that day, and Hong heard me say that I had a "Daiyu thought".</p>
<p>The sun turned into a red face and was about to shake hands with us and say "see you tomorrow." The moon sister is still a bit virginal after all, hiding alone in the thin curtain. The light breeze blowing on the body is not cold but warm. At this time, this beautiful time, is the golden moment for us to go out for a walk after class and a full meal. At this time, Jiangwan Road is full of fragrant mist. Blue-eyed and yellow-haired gentlemen, wooden clogs "Tuo Tuo" friends, and students from the Law School and Chi-Zhi, are all happily wandering around, or going to the park for a walk. Those in love, of course, honestly and politely walk shoulder to shoulder, smiling and whispering, arrogantly ignoring everything. Those who are not in love are friends of the same sex, and at least three or five are in a group. It seems difficult to see them alone. If you are walking alone in the park, you will never worry about not having one or more foreign-dressed coat racks chasing you before and after, which makes He's heart feel 120 points of displeasure. The day before yesterday, I told Hong angrily about what I encountered in the park. Who knew that not only did I not get her sympathy, but she said, "Who told you to be interesting, like me, I guarantee that no one will come to stare." Haha, God knows, when this day last year, Shu and I were wearing blue cloth overalls, and we didn't use any rouge at all, and we still encountered these guys, which was really annoying.</p>
<p>The sky is gradually getting dark, and we inevitably walk towards the school. At this time, what comes towards us is the large group of silk reeling sisters who are about to get off work. They each carry a food basket, which is the only sign that makes people know them at a glance. I admire them very much, admiring their ability to endure hardship and work hard. The silk reeling sisters of the sacred labor force.</p>
<p>In short, everything is by no means so simple. As long as you take the time to take a walk, what is recorded here is only a group of our spring life. I think when students living in schools in bustling alleys imagine our kind of school life, they may still be so envious that they are drooling. (Guang Mei)</p>
<h3 id="e197">Nanguo Society Art Department Exhibition <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The Nanguo Society has been immersed in theoretical work, and has had no practical activities in various departments of art for a long time. At this time of spring harmony and bright scenery, in addition to literature, art, music, drama, film and other aspects, there should be some appearances in order. The Art Department plans to hold an exhibition for three days from the 28th to the 30th of this month on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Association, Xizang Road, because the society members Wu Lu and others will cross Europe in April. In addition to the practice and creation of the society members Wang Daoyuan, Liu Gu, Wu Zuoren, Lu Xiaguang, and Liu Ju'an, there are also various support products from society comrades Xu Beihong and Fang Ganmin. The purpose of this exhibition of the society is to liquidate the past gains and losses in art, show the emerging sprouts, and thus promote the close relationship between art and society, and make it a wing of the entire art movement. On the last day (30th), it is also planned to invite local artists to a tea party at the Paris Grand Theater on Avenue Joffre to discuss the path of emerging art.</p>
