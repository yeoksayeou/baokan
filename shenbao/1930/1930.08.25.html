<p>是日非爲暇日、環境各埠觀衆、已無暇遠來、本埠觀衆亦多爲公務覊絆、亦不能應期往觀、故幾乎空虚一半、聞收入亦五六千盾、</p>
<p>（二）兩華隊先後入塲</p>
<p>四點半鐘、華遠隊由李球怪統率入塲、稍試頭足、中華隊亦接踵而入、二華先行合影、攝影畢由中華球會會長贈球怪花園、稍有致詞、詞畢球證鳴哨佈陣、各舉一方、華遠隊向日據東、中華隊背日佔西、嚴陣待發、雙方擺列陣勢如下、</p>
<p>二華陣伍</p>
<p>華遠　中華</p>
<p>守門　周賢言　陳福義後衛　李寗　陳振發</p>
<p>後衛　安原生　張顯美</p>
<p>前右衛　符象慶　盧慶祚</p>
<p>正衛　孫思敬　張世龍</p>
<p>前左衛　陳鎭和　張顯源</p>
<p>右翼　曹桂成　謝世祿</p>
<p>右輔　陳虞添　林永忠</p>
<p>中鋒　戴麟經　魏文麟</p>
<p>左輔　李惠堂　李秉源</p>
<p>左翼　陳光耀　鄭洪仁</p>
<p>（三）動令下兩軍開火</p>
<p>四點二十五分、動員令下、二軍開火鏖戰、由戴中鋒撥球進攻、左傳右送、迅速異常、轉瞬之間、已臨中華城下、中華後方極力抗禦、卒被拒退、中華前線反攻、勢極劇烈、無如華遠隊防禦有方、難以一逞、</p>
<p>（四）戰勢劇雙方吃緊</p>
<p>戰至四點四十五分左右、華遠隊大舉進攻、施用迅雷不及掩耳之術、頃刻之間、直抵中華心腹、曹將軍破陣直入、横傳當中、中鋒左輔、不能應期追至、良機盡失、中華守門者將球傳中、前線接得來球、如怒潮洶湧、左傳右送、直臨華遠隊險地、幸得周鐵門、目捷足快、得以化險爲夷、（五）秉源乘空得一球</p>
<p>四點五十八分華遠隊包圍中華、前後協攻、空虚防線、中華隊將球救出之後、右翼世綠沿邊破陣反攻、五前線一齊而上、及抵龍門界域、世綠將球傳中、華遠隊回軍不及、左輔秉源追至、躍首一衝、周鐵門施救不及、遂入網中、華遠隊被進一球之後、前線極力反攻、以謀報復、將中華包圍、以致福義應酬不暇、曹將軍屢屢破陣、中華防線魂驚胆怯、無如幸運兒拱照中華龍門、華遠隊終不能達到目的、當五點十分鐘時、曹將軍接得來球、沿邊直上、直入心腹傳中、戴中鋒趕至、舉脚猛射、球非入網、竟越門而過、良機失去、誠屬可惜、繼而再戰、華遠隊實力較强、中華隊仍然被困、正在防務緊急之時、球證即鳴哨休息、上半塲中華以得一對零占先、</p>
<p>（六）陳家球代符象慶</p>
<p>下半塲續戰、五點二十分右前衛符象慶腿部受傷、不能繼續出塲、改由陳家球代額、接觸之後、戰勢更爲劇烈、華遠隊力謀報復、中華隊則欲保其勝譽、一塲劇鬥、甚有可觀、</p>
<p>（七）陳家球化險爲夷</p>
<p>戰至五點三十分、當華遠隊注重左方防線時、中華左翼洪仁將球傳中、右輔林永忠追至、僅與周鐵門相距咫尺、永忠略爲遲延、被陳家球追至、將球踼出界外得、以化險爲夷、及後再戰、華遠隊前線、鬥志頓少、不復極力困敵、僅與之週旋而已、中華隊爲保全其獲勝、力攻死守、</p>
<p>（八）球怪一脚成和局</p>
<p>戰至五點三十七分時候、右翼曹將球又大舉反攻、鋒銳足令敵人膽怯、衝鋒陷陣、如入無人之境、及迫近龍門之時、將球按尺度傳中、李球怪接到、向龍門一掃、陳福義防守無能、遂人網中、（九）接續戰各無得失</p>
<p>接續再戰、華遠隊因幸運兒作祟、勢力雖强、目的難達、故至球證鳴嘯收場、成績仍爲一對一和局、收場之後、所有奬杯、由郭領事發給華遠隊長李球怪收領觀衆盡興而歸、觀衆歡呼之聲、沿街不絶、直至旅舍而後止、</p>
<p>（十）中華遠隊得生軍</p>
<p>中華遠征足球隊自不得南華會合作、改向華僑各球隊挑選好手、茲據其領隊余衡之宣稱、新加人之生力球、刻已有亞九·文禮·亞輝·松齡·緒隆及陳美安等數人云、</p>

<p>中國雙打失敗</p>
<p>昨以二對三敗於葡萄牙</p>
<p>今日與葡單打定决賽權</p>
<p>昨英勝美單打得决賽權</p>
<p>上海萬國綱球扶輪盃咋爲複賽第三幕、出場者中華對葡萄牙之雙打組及英美之單打組、英惠特以三對一勝美史規亞、前後三日、英共勝單打二組雙打一組、負單打一組、已以三對一獲勝、得决賽權、今日無容再戰、準備他日作最後之逐鹿矣、中華雙打組功敗垂成、卒以二對三失敗於葡人手中、因是中葡爭奪决賽權之命運、尙有待於今日之勝負、</p>
<p>（一）英國獲决賽權　　　　　　　六丨四</p>
<p>六丨四</p>
<p>（英）惠特　○丨六　史規亞</p>
<p>六丨○</p>
<p>英美二國實力相差無幾、英得老將惠特之努力、一身兼單打雙打、前後三役果然馬到成功、如願以償、以三對一戰勝英國、獲决賽權、論功行賞、老將惠特當居首席、</p>
<p>開戰之初、雙方各顯身手、堅持不下、每值發球、均占優勢、二人局數、相比演進、彼此不苟、相持成四四和局、乃史規亞首先破例、以自殺果見、而告失敗、均勢之局面已破、惠特又加上一局、遂以六比四勝第一盤、</p>
<p>第二盤惠特氣壯勢順、無往不利、驚人之技能、每自殺敵取勝中、表而出之、不久即以五比一、高占敵上、史規亞年壯力强、努力應戰、連勝三局、出人意料、告成四比五之差、惠特老成穩重、依然出其本領、完成厥功、再以六比四獲勝、</p>
<p>第三盤史規亞精神百倍、進退如飛、恍如第一盤之有聲有色、適逢老將惠特大勝之餘、精力不濟、益有水到渠成之易、其最特色之一點、即在往來抽擊之際、突然趨前攔網、左右逢源、莫不奏功、遂以六比零勝回一盤、是役也、在場觀衆、英不爲之神往嘆觀止焉、</p>
<p>三盤已畢、略作休息、未幾重行入場、劇戰又起、觀者鑒於惠特第三盤之失敗、由於年老氣衰、故其對於第四盤之結果、多以史規亞有望、然而惠特體力早已恢復、正抽反擊、富有變化、史規亞滿目棘荆舉步艱難、一局一局又一局、直至零對六全敗、結果英惠特以三對一獲勝、</p>
<p>（二）葡勝中一雙打</p>
<p>六丨三</p>
<p>五丨七</p>
<p>（葡）卡那佛洛柯拉沙　大丨二</p>
<p>二丨六</p>
<p>六丨二</p>
<p>葡在昨日之情况中、萬無存戰敗中華之雄心、蓋自知實力不及也、其所注意之點即在四、單打一雙打之中、爭得一二、以資保持葡人在滬之榮名、自中華以林寳華邱飛海出席單打作戰後、獲勝單打之念遂行打消、唯一希望、則以全神對付雙打組、前日雙方不分勝負、取消重賽、昨日相戰二小時有半、卒以三對二獲勝矣、</p>
<p>中葡之戰、極爲觀衆注意、蓋其實力相仲伯、難分軒輊也、最後勝利、全在雙方努力如何耳、初中葡各勝一局、不分彼此、忽入短兵相接時代、雙方對網相擊、迅如流星、疾如飛燕、後葡採用高球法、連破中華陣綫、以四比一占先、江之發球有勁、鄭之攔網見功、遂得爭回一局、斯時兩軍針鋒相對又各得一局、比數五比三葡占先、江鄭生氣勃然、有轉機之勢、惜二人策略錯誤、均向對方强者射擊、卒以三對六失敗於第一盤、第二盤江道章開手得利、首先第一局、葡獲二局超出之、未幾造成二二局面、入後江鄭陣綫不固、受敵壓　、反身乏術、連失三局、大局岌岌可危、已成二比五之失勢、忽而江鄭氣勢漸轉、合作又佳、葡人反受其控制、失其活動餘力、一敗塗地、不可收拾、中華乃以七比五勝回一盤矣、第三盤江鄭實力大退、與上一盤轉、有天壤之别、除在第二局獲勝後、連連失機、後至一比五之失勢下、又爭回一局、其餘數局、精彩毫無、而葡方則生龍活虎、令人驚異、第三盤葡以六比二獲勝兩軍在三盤完畢後、略作休息、即開始第四盤、江鄭胸有成竹、出手敏捷、除第一局失利外、以後無往不利、每戰必勝、葡方大告緊急著著失守、是盤也、江鄭最稱得意、以六比二得勝、第五盤爲兩軍生死關頭、葡方出手謹愼、每占上著、江鄭又錯誤百出、努力奮戰、僅奪回二局、卒以二比六失敗、結果、葡以三對二勝雙打組、（三）今日中葡單打</p>
<p>今日下午四時起中對葡作單打比賽、中華邱飛海杯寳華均將出場、十之八九、可獲勝利、又英美之單打、因英已獲决賽權、無比賽之必要矣、香港志强乒乓隊來滬　　　今晚七時初戰儉德</p>
<p>香港乒乓冠軍中華志强聯隊、因慕滬上各隊球藝精深、故特遠來比賽、藉資切磋、而聯感情、現正接洽各名隊如中華·天馬·金星·廣東·日本等次第比賽、今晚七時將與通商杯錦標之儉德隊初次交鋒於儉德籃球房、雙方實力充足、屆時當有一番盛况、門劵小洋二角、劵資悉充該隊旅費云、</p>

<p>自國民革命軍由粤誓師出發。迭摧强逆。克復東南諸省。其間無一役不有飛機隊偵敵炸敵之功。最近革命軍克復濟南。亦先由飛機隊翔濟轟敵。厥功甚偉。飛機之效用。知者固多。但首創飛機隊之人。恐知者尙少。此人爲誰。即現任中央黨部僑務委員會委員李綺菴也。李氏從事革命。埀三十年。當光復以前。李氏尙在美洲。其時飛機之製造。尙在萌芽時代。李鑒於革命軍中。飛機爲不可少之利器乃由美函呈孫總理。建議組織飛機隊。以爲翔空擊敵之用。總理覆函嘉納。李乃集合美洲同志。捐資採購飛機四架。携之回國。參贊戎機。光復後。南京成立臨時政府。總理被推爲臨時大總統。李遂被任爲飛機隊長。此爲革命軍飛機隊組織之第一聲。李即爲飛機隊隊長之第一人也。自此而後。航空人才漸由海外歸國。飛機隊亦漸擴展。今國府航空署已組有飛機七隊。李則以時移境易。已於多年前不作航空生活。現改任中央僑務委員會委員之職。但李之航空資格。固未稍减也。</p>

<p>秋暑困人。日惟北窗下臥。讀畫吟詩而己。比得錢化佛君柬。知君方主南京路雲南路中之藝乘金石書畫會。乃冒暑訪老友於會中。談笑甚懽。會中四壁張畫殆遍。以曾農髯丈之寫米家山。渾而有骨。此老素以書名聞海内。畫名反爲所掩。實則此老之畫正如林琴南老人之爲文所掩也。里里山人繆莆孫寫菊一幀。筆緻工細絶俗。着色停匀。並題以句云。石上流泉無客賞。數枝寒菊是知音。不禁爲之呼絶妙佳搆。其他若張聿光之虎。黄濱虹之山水。劉海粟之寫眞。共計有三十餘件。均係絶妙精品。聞化佛言。此三十件佳作。祇有三天之展覽。繼之將由化佛個人舉行一佛畫展覽會。及前洪憲時代赫赫有名之楊度之書法展覽會。其最足使人注意者。則在徵求新舊劇界中人之能書畫者。若馮子和。金碧艶。鄭正秋。賈璧雲。李君磐。王芸芳。胡恨生。黄玉麟。陳嘉璘等十人。各出作品若干件。舉行一新舊劇界之伶人書畫展覽會。其中若金碧艶之畫馬。黃玉麟之隸書。賈碧雲之山水。均爲不可多得之作。想能轟動一時也。化佛並言。渠藏有各色自來火匣樣及紙烟殼標本甚夥。現擬徵求專藏此項無關大雅之物品。聯合舉行一展覽會。一新滬人耳目。友人汪仲賢氏。素以藏畫片名。聞斯消息。想亦躍躍欲試。聞本報之戈公振氏。專收羅各國之新聞紙類。設以之聯合展覽。當亦成洋洋大觀焉。化佛謂此項展覽名目。須别具風味。走擬以字紙簏三字。而化佛則以『零碎』展覽會爲佳。蓋此項展覽會。不限定以若何收藏物陳列爲標準。苟收藏有陳年宿古之物件。若扇子袋鼻烟壺等。均可加入。化佛言時。津津有味。並以龍井之碧螺春進。香沁入脾。因不必盧同之三徑也。走旋以另有要務。未克再聆化佛之妙語。歸而走筆如左。</p>
<h3 id="c152">滆湖龍現記 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 湯梅</p>
<p>出毘陵西郭南行三十里。有滆湖焉。汪洋一片。烟波浩森。水國風物。别饒逸趣。明陸範有滆湖詩。唐欽有滆湖秋月詞。南北相距凡百里。東西三十五里。湖多白魚。中界宜興。烟霧蒼茫。常見蜃樓。世傳有滆姓居此。携龍卵歸。地陷。遂成湖。故名。一昨返里。偶值舊雨王君槐聲於滬寗道上。車窗茗談。爲道龍現湖上事。證今稽古。殊堪驚異。傭書多暇。因握筆記之。</p>
<p>王君家於滆湖之濱。一溪烟水。適臨戶外。滆岸靑山。隱隱在望。帆檣上下。時鳥競鳴。景物如畫。彌足欣賞。而晨夕間紆迴之棹歌。無腔之漁笛。每與讀書聲相酬答。更視此爲無上樂事焉。一日爲長夏之天。氣候蒸鬱。烈日當空。樵子漁夫。咸暫罷其業。或作宰予之寢。或憩馮異之樹。即樹頭鳴蟬。亦似爲炎威所侵。止其歌喉。此時萬籟無聲。幾如墨夜。天地動機。惟結隊蜻蜓。飛舞欵欵而已。俄而狂風大作。烏雲四合。天空一尾。下埀湖心。雲烟飛騰。麟甲隱耀。湖水四濺。旋繞而上。鄰右奔告。相與驚詫。時巨舟兩艘。方懸帆駛過。一爲風勢所驅。趨入小港。一則桿摧桅折。船身立覆。暴雨忽至。勢若傾盆。歷時炊許。始移向對岸。冉冉上升。而雨亦旋止。頓覺天朗氣清。暑氛盡消。湖上柳絲新碧。波平若鏡。雨後風光。景乃益麗。朋輩數人。欲窮其異。爭掉小舟。過湖跡之。但見龍身過處。綿延三數里。屋宇傾崩。田禾偃折。寛闊尋丈。有如甬道。其盡處則龍王廟也。君固不信今世有龍者。但目視斯狀。夫復何疑焉。</p>
<p>修梅曰。龍爲鱗蟲之長。四靈之一。古且設豢龍之官。典籍所載。斑斑可考。即今地質學考察地中骨骼化石。亦確定爲上古時代之最大動物。但久已絶跡於世。至謂遠見海邊黑影蠕蠕。俗稱掛龍者。實係一種颶風。挾水旋上。然王君眞誠學子。事經目擊。語當非虚。抑滆氏龍卵之說。信非無因耶。是可異矣。</p>
<p>誌謝　但杜宇之攝影集「美的結晶」。風景靜物。無不畢具。又有譚雪蓉女士照影數十幀。活色生香。尤爲雋美。加以徐枕亞。鄭逸梅等之題識。其名貴更不待言。昨承惠贈一册。特此誌謝。并代紹介。</p>
<h3 id="c153">上海法租界之起源（下） <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 季平譯自字林週報</p>
<p>此外復建有全華唯一之天文臺。該台所發表之預測。頗爲一般航行中國海岸之商人所信賴在法租界未變成法人割讓地時。其間爭論經過不少。昔日界内華人有一會館。并有一寄棺房即丙舍。此外尙有公共墳山。以葬貧不能得塋地者。在一八六三年。該會館及葬地位於法租界所越過之界内。於一八六五年。作添築馬路之計。於一八七○年發表擬築之馬路地圖。法工董局决定建築某數條馬路。而四明公所則指出如照所擬地圖築路。則彼等已被核准之墓地將受割裂。雙方爭論不已。結果演出暴動之事。華人放火焚燒多數外國住宅。雖無外人被殺。然時時感覺危險。受重傷者亦有數人。華人死者七人。傷者十二人。結果法領事允許四明公所及墓地保留不動以了事。但此事於一分九八年卒被推翻。先此所擬築之路亦已築成。</p>
<p>茲事之後。法人即在本國租界内。照已意建築各種馬路。并努力經營。致界内成爲最善之住宅區域。一般英美國人均擇地建屋。反不顧其本國租界焉。且界内法人之移居者並不見多。近數年來。法租界進步頗速。各種新修馬路。及近代大建築頗夥。霞飛路爲最帶法國色彩之大路附近一帶之地。如賈爾業愛路。亞爾培路。畢助路等。已漸成爲法租界之中心地點。非僅法人事業在此集中。而萬國事業亦於此進行焉。法運動總會之多數會員爲英人。高入雲霄之大厦名契丹住宅。各國人均家於是。除此以外。現正有二大戯院在建築中。一爲正對法國總會之蘭心影院。一爲霞飛路上之卡爾登。法運動總會爲上海最大之社交中心。因其網球塲游泳池洋台均頗宏大。會員各國均有。跑狗跑馬均附近此處。除法運動總會外。尙有兩俱樂部。一爲法人總會。一爲巡捕總會。法租界自設有電車電燈及自來水廠。不與公共租界相聯合。法水電廠對於法租界之興旺盡力不小。法界内學校林立。對於敎育文化貢獻殊多。獲譽者者亦復不少。聖約瑟學校。直接受聖約瑟堂監理。震旦大學管理嚴明。造就人才不尠。工董局辦有學校二所。一爲環龍路之法國學堂。一爲八仙橋之中法學堂。此外尙有聖芳濟學校。徐匯公學。及天主堂所辦之學校。駐華法國商會所發表之統計。足表示法國社會之勃興及繁盛。法人之駐華者。全體共六千七百零四人。而居滬者已占其五分之一。全華法商行共有二百四十六家。在滬者有一百二十五家。不可謂不盛矣。</p>

<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>遊梵爾賽宮Versailles（四）</p>
<p>梵爾賽宮苑的全景。你最好是站在那正殿的最高層去俯瞰。你看那正殿前面的是白石大平臺。仿彿像北京太和殿前那樣。前部有兩個大噴池是被許多男的女的老的小的種種水神的銅像環繞着的。水花怒噴如雲霧。左右繁植異卉奇木。綴成各樣不同的形象。降十級而至平地。正中是臘東大噴池。Bassinde　Latone中間最高處立裸體女像。這就是女神臘東的像。臘東是亞博洛神的母親。—我先附帶說一句。臘東池是很宏大的。那中間圓形的石臺有五層。每層上面都立着石彫的天使。和銅鑄的怪獸自口裏都噴出不同方向的如霧如浪的水花。幾十枝水花同時噴涌。無論是誰。總是歎爲奇觀的。周環又立石像無數。繁花石磴。上下環繞。花外環樹。樹高數丈剪齊作平形。極望十餘里。森鬱如一。臘東池前方那邊。綠茵十里。白石夾道。每十武列石像。綠茵盡處。則是所謂阿博洛池了。Bassin　d'Apollon湛了漫漫的清水。映着蔚藍的太空。中間阿青洛神駕了四四奔馬。這是法國有名的彫刻。這彫像的特色。在表出阿博洛神瞬間的動作。他那身體傾斜前向。頭面仰起。像注視着日輪的光明那欄。右手緊握着六轡。左手朝後與右手成正反對的姿勢。因此身體的急激運動。都表現出來了。四匹馬受着阿博洛神急激的駕御。便暴怒地在水面上狂奔。這姿勢是表現一瞬間的運動。極能得到充分的効果的。路易十四的全盛時代。梵爾賽宮中齊集彫刻家達五十餘人之多。專門製作宮苑所御用的裝飾。所以現今我們無論在梵爾賽的那裏。總是看見很美很宏大的彫刻。我以爲在歐美無論那一國皇宮都不能比得上。就是中國北京的紫禁城。雖然是崇大。莊嚴。也到底不及這梵爾賽宮苑的滿佈着彫刻的刻光景阿博洛池正對宮殿百丈外。更前作一長溪。亘數里許。兩旁林木參天。其中皆開大路。汽車可以環行。園凡千英畝而分四時。噴水池八十。自長溪盡處回顧。極目綠天。覆岡陵無際。那樣壯麗。開闊的形勢。眞是使人吃驚的。</p>

<p>— 問鵑</p>
<p>一所高大的紅色洋房、巍然獨立在無邊綠色的原野中間、這就是砲台灣某大學的校舍、我因爲羡慕這海邊風景、而且順帶可以避避暑、所以毅然搬到此地來消磨這個暑假、初意以爲旣然放了假、這裏空氣總可以清靜點了、誰知不然、不但許多遠路的學生没有回去、還加上暑期學校新學生的來到、因此這吳淞的拉丁區也就熱閙非常了、</p>
<p>在校門口那條唯一的石子路兩勞、有着二三十家低矮的平屋、中間還有少數是用稻草覆面的、使人想起「黄土築牆茅蓋屋、門前一樹馬櫻花」的詩句來、此地雖没有馬櫻花、然而埀楊幾樹、飄拂在簷前籬畔、又正是掩映在紅牆綠野的中間、雖不能說怎樣幽美、可是人間烟火氣、業已消失殆凈了、</p>
<p>這些矮屋和茅舍的唯一主顧、就是各校的學生、然而十分之九還是中國公學的、其他如商船學校等、只不顧備數罷了、十多家飯館、望衡對宇、他們把其大無比的飯桌都放在路上、這邊和那邊的相隔、不過三尺幸而是門無車馬、即有少數黄包車到來、也儘可以擠着過去的、這些飯館的老板都是河南人、他們用極笨的鍋灶、做着極難吃的飯和菜、用極低廉的價格出賣給他們的主顧、而這些主顧們已是狼吞虎嚥大有不勝其肥甘的樣子、學生時代的生活眞是黄金做的、他們連腸胃的消化力也是超逾一切的、我想、其實他們不但能吃、并且更能利用環境、這樣卑濕的沿海地方、穿皮鞋旣不舒服、又容易生脚病、於是他們把皮鞋脫去、索性連襪子也不穿、只穿一雙木屐終日穿著游泳衣、即使在家居的時候、也只多加一條短褲、他們的皮膚、我不能形容、總而言之、倘然一個印度人經過的時候、一定要認他們是同鄉人咧、我初到此地、只聽見「搭拉…搭拉…」的木屐聲、幾乎疑心此身已在日本的鄉間、誰知不然、他們的鞋不是日本的木屐、而是廣東的木頭拖鞋、樣子很簡單、價錢也便宜、在拉丁區的小雜貨店裏也只賣二毛大洋一雙、别處想更没有這樣的高價了、據說、此風初始是廣東學生提倡起來的、漸漸染給别省人、現在是全體學生一致仿行著、除開幾個女學生之外、在暑期中、學生們並不怎樣用功、他們最高興的運動、就是游泳、反正出門不遠就是黄浦江、再遠一點可以到三峽水、各就自己游泳能力的深淺、而定地點的遠近、每當夕陽西來、明月還未從海裏出來的時候、常見成隊的廣東或四川學生、從塘上走下去洗澡、他們普通都不游得很遠、祗有一回見一個廣東人從「旗房」附近游到燈塔、約有一哩光景、因爲三峽口的水頂急、有長江的水和黄浦的會流、又有海潮冲激、所以常要淹死人、上回商船學生向于一之死、就在此處、所以人們都有戒心、輕易不敢到「石塘」去了、</p>
<p>海邊風景是這樣的奇麗、朝霞將海水染成各種不同的·彩筆難描的畫境、夏末秋初的天氣、正是新凉乍透、閒步堤岸間、但覺風生兩袖、沐浴在這樣大自然的溶液之中、雖非天上、也不是人間所有了、傍晚、夕照的强有力的光輝、幻出滿天異彩、他吻著海水、使他的面頰、泛起紅潮來、此時有屐聲搭拉的男學生、携著倩影婷婷的女同學一同來海邊散步、木屐聲和高跟鞋閣閣的音響、配著漰湃的拍岸潮聲、合成一種奇妙的音樂、此樂祗應海上有、别處是聽不到的、爲了可以多領略一些清景起見、他們便並坐在海塘上談些上下古今、和靑年們之間種種、應有的說話、然而女生人數不及男生的百分之十、於是很多的男生大概是没有女友的、我常說、「這裏是男子的國土、女人只是點綴品罷了、」不過、雖然這樣、他們的學風倒是很好的、即使是一人在外邊坐到夜深、也不會有意外的事情發生、回思法國公園之行坐不能自由的苦處、眞覺得這裏和上海是不在一個世界裏的、并且也不聽見一點胡琴的絃索、以及唱京調的聲響、就是在他們校外的寄宿舍裏、也不過有點笛聲罷了、不比北平各大學的公寓生活、麻將牌和京調是他們唯一的功課、那種腐化的情形、使人想起、都覺得不快的、然而這裏的學生、也不是此間士著、而是從四方八面聚合攏來的啊、但他們都很安分、都很嚴肅、於是想到這所謂羣的力量、眞是不可思議的、</p>
<p>我也叨懶著在這樣的一個環境裏、多讀了幾本好書、</p>

<p>歷史很短而發展很快的大夏大學、眞是一日千里的進步、這并不是我故意的來恭、維事實確是如此、當六年前有百餘學生、幾位先生、脫離了厦門大學、來到上海的時候、即種困苦的環境、像該校王校長說的、開創初始、賃屋而居、湫隘簡陃幾無以蔽風雨、貸資而食、茹苦含辛、幾無以繼朝夕、舉凡物質上應具之事物、直可謂一無所有、在這時候、他們辦學的人、或是任何人、豈料想到、能有今日的大夏麽、眞是大可怪、在前幾年的學生、不過二三百人、而增加的速率、非常之快、直到去年秋季、本預各科、全數竟達到一千三百餘人、而今年第一次考取者已約二百人、最近的第二次考試、錄取者竟五百餘人、最有趣的、是這次考試的那天、膠州路上的男男女女、攘攘煕煕、一座闊大的禮堂、充滿了熱烈的景象、這且不必多說、從此可以看到學生數目增的速度、并聞該校還有第三次考試在九月五日舉行、計算到開學的時候、該校新舊學生可以有一千八百人、這眞是不但大夏的新紀元、就是上海各大學中、恐怕還是空前呢、校舍方面、在梵王渡建築起了新的校舍、嵯峨的洋房八座、以羣賢齋爲大禮堂、以羣策齋爲第一男生宿舍、羣力齋爲第二男生宿舍、羣英齋爲女生宿舍、臨時辦公廳、臨時化學實騐室、敎職員住宅、臨時禮堂、其他并有大飯廳三間、及西餐間、咖啡店等等、都精雅壯麗、此外尙有平房十數間、稱爲市房、供零星販買之用、這是建築方面、開大夏一個新的局面、再設備方面、如在校址西角、自鑿自流井一口、水塔一座、及敎室内裝設反光燈、每層樓上均有自動電鈴、并在羣賢堂最高處設電鐘一架、以免上下課搖鈴打鐘之煩、其他一切用具、皆多爲中西之精緻者、至圖書儀器、亦正力謀充實、并該校宿舍旁有舊水池一所、現正在改造、擬築爲游泳池、以備男女同學課餘之暇、訓練健康之用、再班次方面、除文理商法高師及預科外、并添設幼稚師範、以造成幼稚師資、且擬開辦幼稚園及小學、以協進初等敎育、而成完全學府、這些計劃、都是在本學期即可實現的、其他并聞歐校長等正擬在校舍附近、籌備組織大夏新村、作新社會的設計、凡此種種、皆大夏新氣象中犖犖大者、至於零星的如過去的大夏女生、不是故意誣蔑她們、確實含着閨閣式的小姐風味、而新來的女生中、對於應接也多爲落落大方、我也不必例舉、總之、今日之大夏、不但不是從前的大夏、同時未來大夏的進步、還是未可限量呢、（則驤）</p>

<p>本來中國便是一個很大的啞謎、曾蒙外國學者著「中國之謎」一類的書、可見中國的民間文學實是富豐非凡的、不幸一直流傳下來、除比較留有印象深刻的以外、大多是失散了、甚至有爲一般無聊者點金成鐵、而脫去本型的、也所在皆是、眞眞的估價却老没有給評定下來、就是自從新文藝運動在中國開了花以後、也依然很少發現拿民間的故事傳說歌謠作表現的題材的作品、在戲劇方面更不用說了、在原則上、我們根本不能否認或輕視這些、該是盡量的收集而估定它們的評價、把指出好的裝進藝術的機器去、給全民衆欣賞的機會、把歹的、在可能的範圍内指斥排除、免掉一誤再誤、所以我們該要清切地承認、民間文學的力量、實是賦有深入民衆的權威、因之、如果要謀我們的文藝確確實實擴張到民衆去工、得到民衆的欣賞的反應、便絶對不能忽掉民間的一切文學的價值、</p>
<p>這是很可以見到的、民間文學之被人誤用、第一、在不知所云的低徊趣味的舊劇裏、不是被利用着嗎、天河配、白蛇傳、那一齣不給一般下流者損掉原來的價值、同時更誤了多少人、但是過去我們的作家、對於這種情形、是淡淡然不在乎的、畢竟他們還是脫不了以個人爲中心意識的立塲啊、然而、竟創例的、在我們的文壇上發現了向培良君的民間傳說的獨幕劇「白蛇與許仙」的藝術作品了、實在該是值得稱揚的、白蛇與許仙的故事、在民間是流傳得非常熟的、每當端陽時節、便會　時下粉墨登塲者流、忸忸怩怩地說是上演舞臺、至於其内容是怎樣、則一言難盡了、那裏是表演的眞眞的「白蛇與許仙」的本來面目呢、凡是略略懂得戲劇的人、都會同聲一嘆的吧、那末向培良君在這方面開拓的工程、誠是非常有意義的、第一、就是開了表現民間傳說反映到戲劇上去的例、第二、也是替白蛇與許仙下了一個深切的剖解、而估定了他們在「民間文學」上應得的價值和地位、</p>
<p>關於「白蛇與許仙」的傳說、雖然很多人津津樂道着、却終於没有把他們的偉大的「愛」認識了、大半的見解都是像劇中那個客人這樣、「我想白娘娘從前在深山的時候、多麽逍遙自在、無緣無故到人間來、幾次險些丢了性命、如今正不知道是什麽結果、這眞是自尋煩惱呢、」而有誰能同劇中那個女兒那樣體會同情、「我喜歡白娘娘、我愛她情深似海、我愛她胆大如天、她就只爲了愛、别的什麽也不顧、我也要學她那樣胆大妄爲、」「愛」本來是一件有意思的事、不幸多數人是誤解了它、白白糟塌了它、甚至還要摧殘它、更在過去而誰曾替白素貞說了這樣的話、「感情是這樣奇怪的東西、我們從前也並不是没有熱閙的日子、我只要拿出神通來、就可以隨便呌石頭起來作我們的客人、可以呌山中的小鳥兒變做美麗的姑娘——這些幻影似的東西也可以呌我們一時快活起來、但是我忽然會覺得滑稽、甚至於恐怖、正如同看到了太多的自己的影子底活動、那種没有心底交通的娱樂不會滿足我、她們的手握着我的手的時候没有温熱的感覺激動我的血流、就在游湖的那一天、起我想要完全以人的樣子到人間去生活、我要成一個完全的人去嘗味人間的感情、我要享樂一切人間的歡樂、也要忍受一切人間的痛苦、怡在那個時候、我們看見他了、一個無邪的光輝的少年、所以我就决定了同他過我的生活、」我想、關於白蛇與許仙的熱情、「是的、你是巳經遺失了的、是我拿生命換來的、不止一次、你是我幾次拿生命換來的、」恐怕是很少理會了的、或許會像法海那樣不近情理的說、「爲什麽要迷玆戀於一個妖精、那一切都是假作——美麗、恩情、嬌艶、都是粉墨登塲、都如電光石火、有大毒惡在那後面、我們的生活正如游水、女人是沾滯的重物、使你鹽落、不能安抵彼岸、何况更是妖精、」眞是「不知道我們的感情是什麽樣的、」因之、我對於向培良君的找住這個大歸結、委實表示十分的敬意、實在也是惟有這點、才是所要表現的白蛇與許仙的眞面目啊</p>
<p>在這裏、作者運用成熟的技巧、緊凑的結構、拱衛的襯托、描繪白蛇與許仙、所借用的角色、都非常的恰當、内容也未離了在民間所傳說着的、我敢說、作者這篇「白蛇與許仙」不僅打倒了舊劇的白蛇傳、也是爲我們的戲劇運動開了一個異彩、而且、在戲劇敎育的意義上、也是很深刻的、足以掀動人們的「創造的慾望」與「向上的意志」發展生命的偉力、假若拿這來代替貫輸到民間去、效果、必能像所預期的吧、</p>

<p>— 蔣士彦</p>
<p>蓬勃的草野愈使我們讀者的擁護和友愛了、草野的努力、使我們也無形中努力起來、民族主義在我們腦中飛騰、民族意識在我們理智中固定、民族的需要顯露在我們眼前、我們已經確切地認識了、草野的文章我們早已欣賞、它的論文、創作、隨筆、詩歌、等都是文字秀麗、文氣豪邁的、而尤隨篆及詩歌爲最、這次三卷五號、是詩歌專號、我們又何等欣幸而讚賞呢、</p>
<p>詩歌專號中我們發見了一位新進作者、他的詩直使我們怒髮冲冠、而又是簡短的只有四節、試看他的作品吧、</p>
<p>前進吧　　張俠梅</p>
<p>時代的鐘聲鞭策我們不能徘徊、民族的衰落那容我們再作頽萎、準備着碧血和頭顱爲民族奮鬥、戰死的光榮又何期那黄土一坯、</p>
<p>悲笳不住的狂鳴在催我們上馬、槍鋒露處千縷萬縷的柔絲斷抛、愛哟祇許你熱烈的倚馬一吻、横鞭走也、我誓必血染黄沙、</p>
<p>呼不聽敵人的槍已向我們襲掃、看志士們熱血已先我們而流漂、挺起鋒鋩武器還向敵人描準、準備白骨來砌成我民族的光耀、</p>
<p>進行吧朋友、這日我們的時代、你不要退縮、更不要故作疑遲、我拿着長槍、你也得拿着短刀、敵人不退啊、我誓必血染黄沙、</p>
<p>同樣地在看完這首「前進吧」之後、又有一首白娜的慰勞兵士們的小詩、「獻給戰士」是鼓勵兵士們再振勇氣爲民族而上陣、安慰兵士們爲民族犧牲一切、</p>
<p>戰士、</p>
<p>獻此一盞、</p>
<p>爲你進攻叛逆、</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>戰士、</p>
<p>慨當以慷、</p>
<p>且飲此一斗復一觴、</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>戰士、</p>
<p>號角在吹奏、</p>
<p>你曾否提起精神抖擻、</p>
<p>我們讀了二首慷慨激昻爲民族而走上戰陣時的勉勵和鼓勵、我們的熱血已經沸騰了、我們熱情不能遏止了、覺得世界之大没有一樣是眞正的使我留戀、我們只留戀我們的民族、中國啊、四萬萬的同胞可曾感覺到民族的痛苦嗎、顧此草野普遍天下、　起同胞們不自覺的民族主義的中心、而振作起民氣來、衆志成城、萬衆一心、我們的民族不怕國旗到處、四方振動、</p>
<p>湯增敭的「時代歡吟那靑春」風格意味是異乎上面二首而寓厲於歡的、如今於雜抄下兩節、也可以見到風格的别調、字句的整齊、</p>
<p>時代歡吟那靑春、</p>
<p>鳥雀喚發輕妙的歌聲、</p>
<p>花草表露和煦的笑容、</p>
<p>這兒是幸福聖境、</p>
<p>時代歡吟那靑春、</p>
<p>征馬在彊塲之上奔騰、</p>
<p>萬衆在遠山之前歌詠、</p>
<p>這兒是幸福聖境、</p>
<p>我們看過激昻的雄歌、我們看過鼓勵兵士的勇語、我們看過美麗而凄凉的增敭的近作、現在又看到另有風味的諷剌而冷雋的「都市散絃」第四叚靶子塲畔、宓羅也是我們老早認識的一位作者、他的作品也不用我們多介紹、現在抄三節在下、讀者自己去欣賞吧、</p>
<p>這樣蔓草烟荒士邱巒伏的塲所、可憐的聽憑人家搧了武器打靶、森嚴地殺氣伏着釘剌鐵鋼四週、顯然地劃出了威武肅殺的鴻溝、</p>
<p>這是首圖畫詩、靶子塲的景色突躍在我們的眼前、天色風景氣候人情逼眞的流露出來、這樣好的塲所確是情我們互相擁抱的勝地、只可惜雙手挽着踏進公園的愛人啊、你們可曾聽到「拍拍拍」的槍聲、在你們心中湧起過無限的熱情、想到祖國土地、給異國白佔了去、我們還去欣賞呢、</p>
<p>其餘還有王鐵華的「加鞭上馬前行」和「溪流的支響」、黄魚若的「夜游」的「不許」增敭的「讚美歌」、因篇幅關係略、</p>
<h3 id="c177">歐洲作家新著鳥瞰（十）最後一章 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 曼如</p>
<p>挪威哈姆生著小說</p>
<p>哈姆生、去年因七十歲生辰而在歐洲文藝界引起許多注意的、到現在是已經被公認爲挪威最重要的小說家了、他的近著「最後一章」（Det　Sidste　Lapital）雖然在初出版的時候很轟動、但無論如何我們不能不承認這本書是非常抑鬱的、圖拉黑斯療養院（本書的背景所在地）底經理們眞不幸、不但是因爲他們接二連三地遇到客人們底慘死、而且因爲他們所招攬到的顧客都是些可怕的人物、像這樣的一羣人物、完全一律地可怕、而又同住在一所屋子之内的、眞是少有難逢的了、而像「最後一章」這樣、完全充滿着陰森人物的小說、在現代亦眞是不容易見得到的了、</p>
<p>中心的人物、似乎多少是被作者用作喉舌的、是一個被疑爲有自殺傾向的人、然而這人對於人生的留戀還足以使他努力拒絶讓出他那有火爐的房間、我連接不斷地抱怨伙食之惡劣、當他的妻、剛剛跟他和好了的、因爲那療養院被焚而死在火裏之後、他的「自殺」是只做到掛一條繩子在一根樹枝上的一步、而且因爲他忙於取出他襪子裏的松針、和設法止住燒傷的手底痛楚、他竟放棄了他那自殺的意向、這個人物似乎很可笑、但我們原知道、他就是本書主旨底具體化、本書底主旨是什麽昵、就是、人類是有求生的意志的、即使「生存」是毫無可戀毫無所得了、人還是要熱切地依戀着他那生存、力求避去那不可免的「最後一章」—死之來臨、</p>
<p>我們都是在隊伍裏、我們因然可以　　改換我們的戍地、但是不能改換我　　們的「戰神」、可是、啊、我們的好上　　帝、我們多麽反對這件事、當死神走　　進到門邊的時候、我們點起脚尖站　　着、對他嘘着然而當他將我們抱在　　他懐裏的時候……我們却戰鬥了、</p>
<p>自然、過了不久我們是要倒下的、於是我們的神氣就不免銷沉起來、後來我們就被葬在土裏、那麽我們掙托點什麽呢、還不是要使那些未死的人死起來舒服點麽、</p>
<p>作者是用了一種可怕的幽默去搬弄着他的傀儡、是用了他那卓特的風格寫着、然而他那陰鬱的諷剌却是發而不中的、因爲他使我們從他那收小鏡去看人類的時候我們看是看了、然而我們看不出這些可憐虫和我們自己有什麽相像的地方、照我們想起來是、那個療養院假使能夠使它的主顧們死得更外早些、那就不但對於他們有益、就是對於世界也有益些、像那樣的一批人留在世上做什麽呢、</p>

<h3 id="e34">European Federation and the League of Nations <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>In general, where there is a need, there are obstacles. Therefore, there are those who support and those who oppose. Aristide Briand of France initiated the European Federation, having observed the current state of the European economy and wishing to eliminate future wars. Therefore, he devoted himself wholeheartedly. However, the entity most opposed to this idea is the League of Nations. Therefore, although the replies from various European countries did not express complete agreement, the only one who fundamentally opposed it was Salter, the Director of the Economic and Financial Section of the League of Nations Secretariat. Sir Salter had a very long statement that thoroughly refuted Briand's federation plan, which is due to his position. Why is that? If the European Federation plan succeeds, then the League of Nations' power over a portion of Europe will be reduced. Even if it does not run counter to the League of Nations, someone else will be responsible for this part of the matter. Therefore, it is understandable that those in the League of Nations are opposed to it. Because the real power of the League of Nations is in the hands of the British and French powers, it is inevitable that Sir Salter had to resign from his position as Secretary of the League of Nations after opposing the plan.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that there is nothing in the world of politics that does not have conflicting interests, and there is nothing in the operation of world politics that is not backed by force. The European Federation and the League of Nations are a clear example of this.</p>

<p>Sir Salter's Strongest Criticism Leads to Resignation</p>
<p>Selection of German Delegation to the League of Nations Determined</p>
<p>Kuomintang News Agency, Paris, 23rd - According to reliable sources, the French government has issued an ultimatum to various European countries, proposing that the discussion of the European Federation plan should take place before the opening of the League of Nations General Assembly. It would be even better if discussions could begin simultaneously with the opening of the International Administrative Conference on the 8th. In addition, the French government has also issued a white paper detailing the matter, but it contains no new contributions other than publishing the official replies of various countries. It is said that Briand will personally summarize and analyze the contents of the replies of various countries in Geneva to supplement the white paper.</p>
<p>Kuomintang News Agency, Geneva, 23rd - Sir Arthur Salter, Director of the Economic and Financial Section of the League of Nations Secretariat, has resigned. This news has deeply impressed people within the League of Nations, as it is generally believed that Sir Salter's resignation is purely a protest against Briand's European Federation plan, as he was one of its strongest opponents and had drafted a lengthy memorandum strongly refuting the plan, saying it would harm the League of Nations. The content of this memorandum was recently leaked to the outside, causing attacks from the French press. Kuomintang News Agency, Berlin, 23rd - The German representatives to the League of Nations General Assembly have been appointed. Foreign Minister Curtius will be the chief representative, and Dr. Gaus, legal advisor to the Foreign Office, and Count Bernstorff, chief German representative to the League of Nations Disarmament Commission, will be the main representatives. In addition, several important figures from the government and opposition parties will be appointed as usual to participate.</p>

<p>Bombay News: The Indian Cotton Merchants' Association's proposal to postpone the release of agreed-upon goods by Bombay mills for February was rejected by the mills. The selling agents took responsibility for this, and for self-protection, the selling agents advised their clients to close the market for a month. As a result, many mills are unable to operate due to financial difficulties. Seven factories, such as the Bomanji Petit and others (with a total of 271,496 spindles, 6,878 looms, and 11,321 workers), have suspended operations from August 1st to await market recovery. The Sassoon group's ten factories will also suspend operations from August 15th. By the end of August, a total of approximately thirty factories will be temporarily closed. With a large amount of unsold inventory, factories are suspending operations one after another. Naturally, there will be job losses, mill stocks are falling sharply, and the market situation is very depressed. (World)</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Telegram from Luohe: To All Newspapers: Wang Zhao-ming has betrayed the teachings of the late leader and sold himself to the enemy. His despicable behavior has long been despised by the people of the country. Recently, he has scurried north, conspiring to cause trouble with his running dogs Chen Gongbo and others, organizing a so-called expanded conference. A mere eleven people, representing each other, have no legal basis and are logically untenable. They think they can cover up the eyes and ears of the world, fabricating illusions and creating a cartload of ghosts. It is truly ridiculous and will be laughed at at home and abroad. They are also instigating a group of outdated military men and politicians to collude with the Communists and recruit bandits to wreak havoc in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. The flames of Changsha are frightening to hear, and the clear currents of the Yangtze and Han rivers are almost boiling. At present, the people of the three provinces are moving and resettling, with corpses piling up and wrongs unaddressed. Heaven and earth are filled with sorrow. Recalling the autumn of the sixteenth year of the Republic, when national unification was on the horizon, Wang and his ilk, failing to satisfy their desire to be leaders, did not hesitate to go against the trend, creating the absurd theory of the separation of Ning and Han to carve up territory, eliminate dissidents, and cruelly abuse the innocent, killing countless people and leaving corpses strewn across the fields. They plundered wealth without restraint and utterly destroyed the rites and teachings. The wounds have not yet healed, and the scars are still fresh. To this day, at the juncture of the three provinces, red flames fly and bandits fill the roads. This is all due to the endless poison of Wang and his ilk. It is evident to everyone that wherever Wang and his ilk set foot, disaster will befall the people. These villains act with impunity and stop at nothing. We know that their so-called expanded conference today is aimed at subverting our central government's grand plan for unification. If their demands are not met and their insatiable desires are not fulfilled in the future, what is to prevent them from reorganizing and changing their position to overthrow the warlords they currently support and prop up their running dogs? We, the revolutionary soldiers, are willing to obey the doctrines, defend the party and the country, and sweep away the remnants of Yan and Feng to save our compatriots in Hebei from the scourge of war. We will move forward swiftly and express our righteous indignation together. In this way, the city foxes and village rats will lose their support, and the future of the party and the nation will be greatly benefited. If Qingfu is not eliminated, the troubles in Lu will not end. If Bo You frightens people, the people of Zheng will be afraid. All the wise men of the country and comrades of our party should unite to denounce and punish them. Bo Gun was unrighteous, his words were false and his deeds were treacherous, and Shao Zheng was full of deception. We hope that the punishment of these two will satisfy the hopes of the people. We have filed this petition with all sincerity and await your clear instructions.

<h3 id="e50">Song Ziwen's Remarks After Arriving in Hankou <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Finance Minister Song Ziwen arrived in Hankou at 3 PM today, after traveling by air from Shanghai on a postal flight that departed at 7 AM. He was accompanied by Qian Dajun, Commander of the 3rd Training Division, and Li Jihong, former Director of the Hubei Finance Department. It is reported that Song's visit to Hankou was not telegraphed in advance, so the important figures of Wuhan were unaware of it. Chen Shao嬀, Finance Special Commissioner, had even taken a steamer to Beijing the day before to meet Song, and so they missed each other. After Song arrived in Hankou, he was received by Li Muqing, Chief of the Special Tax Office, and stayed at the Provincial Bank Building. That evening, he went to the Executive Headquarters to meet with Director He Yingqin, where they spoke for about two hours before he returned to his residence. I assumed that Song's visit must be for an important mission, so I went to visit him and was received by Song, who spoke as follows: "Since my last visit to Hankou, nearly a year has passed. Although I have received telegram reports about the recent financial situation in Hubei Province, I am not fully aware of it. Therefore, after inspecting Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, and Shanghai, I took the opportunity to come to Hankou to examine the latest situation for reference. This is one of the reasons for my visit to Hankou. Secondly, the Ping-Han Railway war is making rapid progress, and the joint suppression of bandits in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi has also begun. The issue of military pay is extremely important, and it is urgent to come to Hankou to discuss everything with Director He of the Executive Headquarters. Thirdly, there are the salt tax loans and the promotion of short-term treasury bonds. The use of salt tax loans is for the suppression of bandits in the three provinces, and the issuance of short-term treasury bonds is a preparation for all facilities after the military is settled. Both are important. This time, I will discuss the methods of promoting treasury bonds with the local authorities here, and I will also consult with the banking community to ensure that the salt tax loans can proceed without hindrance."

<h3 id="e51">Martial Law in Wuhan to be Lifted <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Wuhan has been under martial law since it was declared on the 30th of last month, for more than twenty days. In the meantime, martial law decrees have been promulgated, emergency inspections have been carried out, and secret Communist Party organs have been closed down, and important Communist Party members have been executed. The bustling market has suddenly taken on a solemn appearance. The Wuhan Garrison Command, with a large army gathered and defenses consolidated, originally intended to lift martial law immediately, but because rumors were still rampant and people's hearts were uneasy, the period of martial law was moderately extended to ensure preparedness. Recently, most of the Communists have been arrested and are being sentenced separately. The date of the uprising (August 14th) has also passed peacefully. The rumors in the city have completely subsided, and the Garrison Command has decided to lift martial law in the shortest possible time, restoring the previous state of covert alert. As for the captured bandits and communists, more than sixty people have been shot or beheaded successively. There are still many in prison. Today, Wang Duqing and other eighteen people who were confirmed to be important Communist Party members and the bandit Huang Benqing were executed by shooting, and their crimes were announced as follows: (1) According to the Hubei Higher Court, the 25 Communist Party members including Wang Duqing and Guo Yukang were transferred to the Garrison Command along with the case files, requesting that they be handled in accordance with the secret orders of the National Government. After a detailed review of the original cases, it was determined that Wang Duqing and other eighteen people had indeed joined the Communist Party and were responsible for their work. Wang Duqing served as the commander of the six counties in southern Hubei, presiding over the uprising. Guo Yukang, Chen Xiyan, and Zou Jiyu led the masses in the uprising, destroying railways, attacking cities, and killing people. Zhang Renyu, Lei Zhen, Ku Jihua, Wu Peifu, Rao Minggan, Cheng Xielin, Meng Sheng, Gao Zhang Yingtang, and Zhou Yeshi colluded in the uprising, cruelly killing innocent people. Liang Muxin conspired to kill, set fire, and rob. Liu Jiusong colluded with bandits and looted at will. Liu Antang colluded with others to carry guns and destroy the dyke administration. Huang Jiuzhi gathered bandits to organize an uprising. Zeng Puchen moved the regiment guns and secretly plotted wrongdoing. All the evidence is conclusive and unforgivable by law. According to the court, Wang Duqing collaborated with He Kong in prison, claiming to be the leader of the Communist Party. Zeng Puchen served as secretary in prison, and the others, such as Guo Yukang, either served as commanders or engaged in propaganda and collusion, repeatedly launching uprisings. The circumstances were particularly serious and unavoidable under the law. In accordance with the National Government's Secret Order No. 1, they were all sentenced to death to uphold the law and deter others. In addition to signing the order to bring the criminals to the execution ground to verify their identities and execute them by shooting, this is hereby announced for general knowledge. (2) According to the report from the Inspection Department of the Garrison Command, the bandit Huang Benqing was brought to the Garrison Command. According to Huang Benqing's confession, he admitted to kidnapping people for ransom and looting with his gang in the Daijia Township area of Mianyang. His crimes were heinous and he should be sentenced to death in accordance with Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits to serve as a warning. In addition to supervising the extraction of Huang Benqing to verify his identity and tie him to the execution ground for execution by shooting, this is hereby announced for general knowledge.

<h3 id="e52">Wuhan Municipal Government Established <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Xiong Bingkun Scheduled to Take Office</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Wuhan Municipal Government, after being resolved to be established by the Provincial Government and with the appointment of Committee Member Xiong Bingkun as Mayor, has finally been completed after a long period of preparation. It officially began operations on the 20th. The original organization of the government was to establish a Secretariat, a Finance Bureau, a Public Works Bureau, a Social Affairs Section, a Health Section, and a branch accounting office and a city treasury. Now it has been slightly changed. In addition to retaining the Finance and Public Works Bureaus, the Secretariat has added a General Affairs Section and a Documentation Section, and the Social Affairs and Health Sections have also been changed to sections. The branch accounting office and the city treasury will not be established for the time being, and a Finance Section will be established to manage them. In addition, a Counsellor's Office has been added. The directors of the bureaus have not yet been appointed, only the Secretary-Director Xia Fuchu, Assistant Secretary Wang Sichang, Counsellors Lu Yu and Huang Jiqing, General Affairs Section Chief Tan Changzhao, Documentation Section Chief Liu Yuancong, Finance Section Chief Hu Zhendong, Social Affairs Section Chief Jiang Bingzhong, and Health Section Chief Zhu Baoguang have reported to the government for work on the 20th. When the government was established, I visited an important official and asked which bureau would be established first and when the mayor would take office. According to the conversation, the Finance Bureau will be established first. The establishment of the Public Works Bureau is important, but it may have to be postponed due to financial difficulties. The date of the mayor's inauguration has not yet been determined, but it is planned for the first of next month. A request has been submitted to the Provincial Government and the Executive Yuan to send officials to administer the oath. If they are appointed within the next few days, the swearing-in ceremony can be held on the first of next month, otherwise it cannot be scheduled. (August 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Joint Bandit Suppression Plan for Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After the recovery of Changsha, the authorities felt that the bandit communists were rampant and were eager to suppress them. Therefore, there was a joint bandit suppression plan for the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, which was actively prepared by Director He Yingqin of the Executive Headquarters, with the aim of completely eliminating them in the shortest possible time. The plan has now been drafted and will be ordered to the troops of the three provinces for strict implementation. The recent bandit suppression situation, the general outline of the plan, and the strength of the bandit army are explored and recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Strength of the Bandit Army: The most prominent Communist bandits entrenched in the border areas of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are He Long, Peng Dehuai, Zhu De, Mao Zedong, etc. The next are Huang Gonglue, Wu Zhonghao, Chen Yi, Lin Biao, Fang Zhimin, Duan Qifeng, Peng Qingquan, Shao Shiping, Li Wenbiao, and Duan Yuequan, etc. Although they have very few guns, the rabble amounts to more than 30,000 people. The exact number of other scattered bandits is still unknown. This time, Peng Dehuai's forces captured Changsha, and Zhu De, Mao Zedong, etc. also launched an uprising in Jiangxi. The Communist bandits between Hankou and Jiujiang were even thinking of taking the opportunity to launch an uprising. Later, when the Peng bandits withdrew from Changsha and fled to Pingliu, and Zhu Mao's plan to seize Nanchang also failed, the bandit forces were slightly suppressed. Now the Peng bandits have fled to Jiangxi, although they have not yet established contact with Zhu Mao, they are not far apart. Judging from the situation, they will definitely try to unite and resist the government troops. However, their strength has been greatly reduced, and many of those who were coerced into joining have also fled. Surrounded by government troops on all sides, it is difficult to think that they can succeed again.</p>
<p>Bandit Suppression Arrangement: This time, the troops of Hunan Province to suppress the Peng bandits include the divisions of Liu Jianxu, Luo Fanyi, Wei Su Zhong, and Tao Guang, and the brigades of Chen Guangzhong, etc. The troops of Hubei Province include the divisions of Gong Bingfan and Luo Lin, and a part of Peng Qibiao's brigade. Jiangxi Province has also dispatched the division of Zhang Huizan and the brigade of Dai Yue to intercept and encircle them in different directions. The encirclement has already been formed. Currently, the divisions of Luo Lin and Gong Bingfan are distributed along the Yuezhou-Miluo-Pingjiang line, and the divisions of Liu Jianxu and Luo Fanying are distributed along the Liuyang-Liling line. According to aerial reconnaissance reports, the bandit suppression troops have established contact with each other, forming an arc of hundreds of miles from Xiushui and Tonggu in Jiangxi to Pingjiang, Liuyang, and Liling in Hunan. The bandits in Wanzai and other places are already heavily surrounded. The scattered bandits in other places are also in a state of utter disarray. After the aircraft dropped bombs along the way, many were killed.</p>
<p>Executive Headquarters Meeting: The Wuhan Executive Headquarters convened a temporary meeting on the evening of the 16th to discuss the bandit suppression measures for Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. The attendees included He Guoguang, Chief of Staff of the Executive Headquarters, Wang Lun, Deputy Chief of Staff, the chiefs of various departments, and various counselors. Director He Yingqin was inspecting the fortress at Shekou and was replaced by He Guoguang as chairman. The result of the discussion was that He Yingqin will convene a bandit suppression conference for the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi in the near future, bringing together the military and political leaders of the three provinces to jointly discuss the implementation measures. If Lu Dipin, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, are unable to attend the meeting due to their involvement in bandit suppression, they will send their responsible representatives to attend. As for the special bandit suppression agency, it was originally planned to establish a Bandit Suppression Office for the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi attached to the Executive Headquarters, but to save expenses, a Pacification Section will be temporarily added to the Executive Headquarters. Zhou Shaojin, a senior staff officer of the Ministry of Military Affairs, has been appointed to temporarily preside over it.</p>
<p>Pacification Plan: He Yingqin has completed the draft of the pacification plan for the three provinces and submitted it to the Commander-in-Chief for review and implementation. The general allocation of military strength is to request Commander-in-Chief Chiang to transfer three divisions to garrison Wuhan, to be deployed at any time. The remaining Xie Bin, Peng Qibiao, Li Yunlong, Guo Rudong, Liu Xiang, Lai Xinhui, Dai Minquan, Xu Dezhao, and Fan Shisheng stationed in Hubei, and Luo Lin, Gong Bingfan, Wei Su Zhong, Tao Guang, Luo Fanying, Liu Jianxu, Chen Guangzhong, and Dai Douyuan stationed in Hunan, and Zhang Huizan, Dai Yue, and Deng Ying and other divisions and brigades stationed in Jiangxi, will all be responsible for pacification, totaling no less than eighteen divisions. As for the order of suppression, it is planned to divide it into three periods: the first period is to suppress the Communist bandits in Hunan, the second period is to suppress the Communist bandits in Jiangxi, and the third period is to suppress the Communist bandits in Hubei. It is expected that it will be completed within two months. Representatives Coming and Going: After He Yingqin finalized the pacification plan for the three provinces, in addition to telegraphing the main points to Commander-in-Chief Jiang, he also handed over the detailed plan to Hu Yimin, the representative of the Seventh Army, to present to Commander-in-Chief Jiang at the front. Hu has already flown to the front on the 17th. He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, also sent representative Yu Xiangsan to Hankou to meet He and ask for instructions. He returned to Hunan on the 18th with the plan to report to He Jian. Xie Muhan, representative of Jiangxi Province, also came to Hankou at the same time and returned to Jiangxi on the 17th to report. On the 18th, Director He sent Jia Botao, a counselor of the Executive Headquarters, to Nanchang to take charge of liaison for the Ninth Route Army, and sent Leng Xin to Beijing to report everything to the Executive Yuan of the National Government. Jia and Leng left for the east together on the evening of the 18th. (August 19th)</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The three-province joint suppression of Peng Dehuai, Zhu De, and Mao Zedong began after Director He issued the general offensive order on the 16th. The Wei and Liu units of the Fourth Route Army and Luo Lin's division advanced in three directions from Pingliu to Xiushui, Tonggu, and Wanzai. The 18th Division of the Ninth Route Army, in addition to having the 54th Brigade firmly guard the Jiangxi border, Dai Yue's unit had already arrived in Xiutong, engaging in interception. It is reported that Commander-in-Chief Lu recently received a telegram from Yang Mianzhong, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, from Beijing, stating that President Tan had recently telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Jiang requesting the addition of elite troops to Jiangxi to assist in the suppression. Commander-in-Chief Jiang had previously agreed to draw the 1st Training Division to Jiangxi and it will be able to set off in the near future. After the arrival of the division, the bandit suppression can be carried out on a large scale. In order to ensure that the bandit suppression troops of the three provinces are connected as one, Director He, in addition to telegraphing Hunan and Jiangxi to send personnel to the Wuhan Executive Headquarters to form a Pacification Section, also convened a bandit suppression conference for the three provinces. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Headquarters has appointed Yin Jingrang to participate, and the Ninth Route Army has appointed staff officer Yang Duo to participate. As for the situation of the Communist bandits, it is reported that most of Zhu Mao's forces are still in Wanzai, and they still have plans to unite with the Peng bandits and flee to Hunan. A group of Communist bandits in the Gan River captured Taihe at the end of last month, and the burning and killing was extremely tragic. The Xiao bandits crossed the river and attempted to attack Ji'an, but were defeated by Deng's division, with more than 200 bandits killed. The electric wire mesh, artillery emplacements, pillboxes, and trenches newly built by Deng's division in Ji'an have now been completed, and the Nationalist and People's Rights ships are escorting the Ji'an to the provincial capital mail. The fortifications around the provincial capital were originally very solid, and Commander-in-Chief Lu is also planning to follow the Guangdong method of building pillboxes at various key points and setting up machine guns and cannons to consolidate the security of the provincial capital.

<h3 id="e56">Imminent Resumption of Shipping in Fuzhou <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Business Sector Suffers Losses of Approximately Two Million</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the war in Fujian Province, transportation between the provincial capital and northern Fujian has been severed, and commercial shipping has completely stagnated. Tea, rice, paper, bamboo, wood, bamboo shoots, and charcoal produced in northern Fujian have been stockpiled in the mountains and cannot be shipped downstream. Cloth, salt, oil, flour, hardware, and sundries from the provincial capital cannot be shipped upstream, leaving no way to provide supplies. As a result, commerce in both the provincial capital and northern Fujian is deteriorating daily, and bankruptcies are constantly heard, impacting Shanghai and Hong Kong trading houses that have established branches in Fujian to engage in import and export trade, leading to significant losses. It is estimated that business losses in the past two months have exceeded two million yuan. If this continues without relief measures, the financial situation at the end of the year will be dire. Currently, business circles in Fuzhou and Yanping, in order to save themselves, have jointly launched a movement to restore river transport. After much effort and appeals, they have obtained the understanding of local military authorities. The financial authorities, due to the decline in tax revenues after the suspension of freight transport, are particularly supportive. Yesterday, the 20th, the Fuzhou General Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of import and export merchants to discuss resumption measures. The Provincial Government, the Finance Department, the Special Commissioner's Office, the 56th Division Headquarters, and the Marine</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Corps Headquarters all sent special commissioners to participate. The results of the discussions were quite satisfactory. The general plan is for the military authorities to establish an inspection station at Hongshan Bridge to specifically inspect goods shipped downstream from northern Fujian. On the northern Fujian side, the Yanping Chamber of Commerce will request local military authorities to establish an inspection station at Shuikou to specifically inspect goods shipped upstream from the provincial capital. If there is no contraband, they will be allowed to pass during the ceasefire period to facilitate circulation. Goods shipped upstream and downstream before the outbreak of hostilities that have been stranded at various bamboo rafts and other locations have already been specially released to prevent spoilage. They have arrived and are being unloaded one after another, awaiting clear procedures before being reloaded and shipped back. This is a glimmer of hope for the business community in Fujian Province.

<h3 id="e57">The Jiaoji Railway After the Great War <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the Jin army's eastward advance, the entire Jiaoji Railway line has almost entirely fallen into military zones, resulting in property losses and business deficits estimated at over two million yuan. With the recovery of Jinan by the Central Army and the rout of the Jin army, the railway has been cleared and reopened to traffic on the 19th. The extent of the damage to the railway and the Railway Bureau's preparations for reopening are summarized below: (1) Regarding bridges, there has been no major damage from Qingdao to Zuoshan. The most severe damage is between Zuoshan and Zihedian. Many bridges, such as the Wei River, Dawei River, Yun River, Xiaotang River, Zi River, Baiyang River, and nearby river bridges, were blown up by the Jin army. Some had one or two spans, others had five or six spans. The Railway Bureau sent the heads of the engineering and traffic departments to inspect and supervise repairs on the 12th of this month. All the destroyed bridges have now been temporarily repaired with sleeper-supported piers and can barely handle traffic. There is less damage west of Xindian to Jinan. (2) Regarding rolling stock, since the outbreak of hostilities, the Jin army detained approximately two hundred cars on the western section. The eastern section has approximately eighty locomotives belonging to this railway and other railways, approximately two hundred passenger cars, and approximately one thousand four hundred freight cars. Most are currently being used for military transport. The Jin army did not take the rolling stock on the western section when they retreated, thanks to negotiations with the Japanese side, which preserved them. (3) Regarding telegraphs and telephones, telegraph poles and electrical machinery along the line west of Zuoshan were mostly destroyed by the Jin army. Even telephone sets and batteries were mostly taken away, resulting in great losses. The Railway Bureau is gradually repairing the train dispatch telephones and route signs. However, there are extreme difficulties in obtaining workers and materials. The Railway Bureau is currently transporting existing materials to be used as much as possible and borrowing workers from the city telephone bureau in order to complete the repairs as soon as possible. (4) Fundamental plans: The Railway Bureau's repairs to the destroyed bridges this time were originally intended as an emergency measure, using sleeper-supported piers, which are inherently dangerous. To be cautious, the railway has specifically instructed all drivers to pay attention and proceed slowly when passing over the bridges and to assign craftsmen to guard each wooden pier to repair it at any time to avoid oversights. However, this is not a permanent solution. Therefore, the railway has instructed the engineering department to design detailed plans for fundamental repairs. For the destroyed bridges that were originally planned to be replaced or have alternate lines built, it is currently planned to allow traffic to pass on the alternate lines temporarily. Other bridges are also planned for fundamental repairs. However, iron plates and steel materials are needed. In addition to the materials originally purchased and stored by the railway, which can be transported for use, those that have been purchased but not yet delivered will be telegraphed separately to expedite delivery for continuous application. (5) Remedial measures: Salaries of the railway's east and west section employees are urgently needed to be reissued, and interest on debts, which amounts to more than 500,000 yuan per month, cannot be delayed. In the past month, with the interruption of traffic, the railway's operating revenue was only about one-tenth of what it used to be. It is now actively rushing to repair bridges in the shortest possible time. The large amounts of materials and funds required are huge. The Railway Bureau is digging everywhere to meet urgent needs, but it is still difficult. It is now planned to reduce and issue employee salaries in proportion to subsidize. It is reported that regulations stipulate that from this month, employee salaries of over one hundred yuan will be paid at 80% first. (August 21st)</p>

<p>Xingyang, Kaifeng Correspondence: According to someone who recently came from Xingyang, the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth districts of southern Xingyang are surrounded by mountains on three sides and have always been a haunt for bandits. This spring, a large band of bandits occupied the northern border of Mixian County, which is close to the seventh district of Xingyang. Consequently, more than three thousand bandits infiltrated from Fangguo and other villages in the south of the sixth district and occupied the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts, causing devastating burning and looting. It is estimated that more than forty li from north to south and fifty li from east to west in southern Xingyang are all under bandit control. More than five hundred villages in the area have been reduced to ashes. When the garrison led by Commander Li came to suppress them, the bandits fled again, pushing the captured elderly and weak into ditches and killing the disabled on the roads. Deaths and injuries were everywhere, and the mountains were filled with blood and flesh. Later investigations revealed that approximately 15,400 people were captured or injured, and approximately 9,600 houses were burned down. The loss of property and food is incalculable. Currently, the markets are deserted, and people are scarce. Corpses are exposed without anyone to collect them, and there is no strength to repair the burned houses. The captured have no money to redeem themselves, and the survivors have nowhere to return. It is truly an unprecedented disaster.</p>
<p>Neihuang: Li Shican of the Henan Provincial Relief Committee sent a telegram on the 8th to the Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, and various charities in Beijing and Shanghai, stating that, according to reports from the Neihuang Relief Sub-Committee, Neihuang County is the poorest area in northern Henan, and has suffered from years of war and banditry, making life unbearable. In the 17th year, there was drought and locusts; in the 18th year, there were drought, floods, and locusts, three disasters occurring simultaneously. Tens of thousands of disaster victims abandoned their homes and went to the Northeast to seek food. This spring, they encountered another political upheaval, and the allocation of funds and conscription of soldiers exhausted everything. They hoped that the wheat harvest would save their lives, but unexpectedly, violent winds and hailstorms wreaked havoc, causing all the wheat ears to be broken and the harvest completely lost. The young autumn seedlings were also severely damaged, and the autumn harvest is also hopeless. The surviving people are dying and urgently need relief. Neihuang is a barren and impoverished area that has suffered from repeated disasters, resulting in depleted wealth and food. This time, it has suffered another severe wind and hail disaster, with the complete loss of wheat and grain, making it difficult to sustain life. They earnestly request all philanthropists to have great compassion and provide generous relief to save the disaster victims. They are deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Linru: Li Shican of the Henan Provincial Relief Committee sent a telegram on the 10th to Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, and Nanjing, stating that, according to reports from various organizations in Linru, bandit leader Cui Yinchuan and others captured Zhouzhuang Village in the northeast of the county, killing more than one hundred people, extorting more than one hundred tickets, looting property, and burning everything down. Duzhuang Village in the west of the county was captured by bandits, who are still occupying it. On July 15th, the west gate of the county seat was attacked by a large number of bandits, who burned, killed, looted, and caused incalculable losses. Before leaving, they kidnapped 158 tickets. On the night of July 18th, Shilibu, ten miles west of the city, was again attacked and looted by the bandits occupying Duzhuang Village, who burned everything down and kidnapped more than one hundred people. On the 28th, a village east of the city was also captured by bandits, with even more severe burning and killing, and even greater losses. Currently, bandits are everywhere in the fourth, sixth, and seventh districts south of the Ru River, and people find it difficult to escape. They cannot afford to redeem the kidnapped tickets, and the dying disaster victims are begging for relief. After investigating the villages affected in Linru, their wealth has been exhausted. If no measures are taken to provide relief, the lives of the people cannot be saved. He earnestly requests the swift allocation of relief funds to save the survivors, and eagerly awaits orders.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Russian Bandits Disturb the Eastern Railway <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Three Incidents in Three Days</p>
<p>Secret Soviet Manipulation</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The actions of Russian bandits on the Harbin-Manzhouli line have recently become completely disciplined, and their attempts to harm traffic on the western line are becoming increasingly urgent. On the evening of the 15th of this month, a large number of stacked sleepers were found on the railway tracks at Duiqingshan Station, one hundred li from Harbin. The 23rd passenger train from Harbin to Ang'angxi Station passed through the area at 12:50 a.m., but fortunately, they were discovered early, and the train was not derailed. This is one incident. At 2:00 a.m. on the 16th, several hundred Russian bandits invaded Bali Station between Boketu and Hailar. The local garrison of only a dozen soldiers was unable to resist, and the station was burned and looted by the bandits, who killed six Chinese workers and burned down the entire station before leaving. This is another incident. On the morning of the 17th, the fourth passenger train from Manzhouli to Harbin was approaching Shartu Station when it was discovered that someone had pushed a freight car onto the tracks in heavy fog, intending to cause a tragic train collision. Fortunately, the driver saw it and stopped the train in time, avoiding danger. In addition, there have been countless incidents of hollowing out sleepers and removing spikes. According to reports from the Railway Protection Army Headquarters, in addition to the Zhu Guofu gang, which ostensibly claims to be "anti-communist," the other gangs all have official Soviet officers inside. One of the most famous officers is "Gusya Yina Ali." These Russian bandits are stationed in various places and specialize in harassing small stations in remote areas with weak defenses. Their main base has advanced to the Yalu County border, in a forest. Recently, many Mongolians have joined, so the bandit forces are quite large. It was previously reported that the Russian director of the Eastern Railway, "Berzin," went to Boketu, ostensibly to meet with Russian bandit leaders. Although his intentions are unknown, it is likely to convey orders from the Russian cadres of the Eastern Railway. The Soviet Union's motivation for encouraging Russian bandits to harass the Eastern Railway line is said to be quite profound. The proposal to increase the number of Red Army troops stationed along the Eastern Railway line, which was raised at the Blagoveshchensk Conference, has not yet reached a clear conclusion. Now that the Sino-Russian Conference is in progress, the Russian side raised this matter again, but Mo Teh-hui rejected it in the preparatory meeting. Therefore, they are using a roundabout method, secretly instigating Russian bandits to disrupt the Eastern Railway line. Since the western region is vast and there are means of entering and exiting, they are wreaking havoc at an accelerating pace. These so-called Russian bandits have well-equipped guns and ammunition, suggesting that they are a disguised form of regular troops. In the future, if the western region is disrupted and uneasy, or a major terror occurs, the Russian side can use the excuse that the Chinese army is unable to protect the railway line and demand to increase the number of Soviet troops stationed there. Our side is aware of their hidden intentions. The 51st Regiment and 43rd Regiment of Su Bingwen's brigade of the Heilongjiang Army have each dispatched units on the 15th to pursue Russian bandits in the Solun and Yalu areas. The Railway Protection Army Headquarters is also planning to add armored train units to patrol the Harbin-Manzhouli line to prevent problems before they arise. (August 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Zhalainuoer Coal Mine Problem <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Political Committee Has Ordered Restoration</p>
<p>The Board of Directors Holds an Extraordinary Meeting</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Eastern Railway Board of Directors will convene an extraordinary board meeting tomorrow to discuss the issue of the rise and fall of the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine, bringing together Chinese and Russian directors to discuss how to handle this issue. Since Mo Teh-hui's departure abroad, all matters related to the railway have been decided through consultations between the Chinese acting director Li Shaogeng and the Russian deputy director Yemushanav. Important matters, except for those that cannot be delayed, are implemented first and then submitted for retroactive recognition when a formal meeting is convened in the future. All other matters are suspended. Regarding the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine, the Russian Railway Bureau chief submitted a report last month stating that it is necessary to organize a miners' committee and explore the coal seams first. The opinions of Soviet cadres generally tend towards shutting it down and recommending that the Eastern Railway use Suicheng coal from Russia. Guan Yupu, director of the materials department of the Eastern Railway, and other department heads who care about the future of the Eastern Railway, believe that shutting down the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine is the Soviet Union's deliberate attempt to lead the Eastern Railway to suicide. Therefore, they petitioned the Northeast Political Affairs Committee to order the Eastern Railway authorities to restore it. The Political Committee then ordered the Chinese director to take charge of the matter. This matter is of such importance to our country. Therefore, after receiving the order, the Chinese authorities first contacted the Russian side to obtain their consent and convened an extraordinary meeting before the number of directors was complete to decide whether to restore the coal mine. At tomorrow's meeting, there will be three Chinese and three Russian directors in Harbin. Although it is not a formal meeting, there may be a debate. It is reported that the specific opinions of the Chinese side have been decided: regardless of what happens, one side must send personnel to explore the coal seams, and the other side must immediately hire workers to mine the areas where coal seams have already been discovered. If this is the case, it will violate the Russian side's intention to sell Soviet coal, which they may not want. As for the Eastern Railway's 1930 budget, it has already been reviewed by the board of directors. It was decided that the railway's income this year has sharply decreased on all lines, and each passenger and freight train is losing money. If income does not increase in the next few months, it will be necessary to borrow money to survive. Therefore, the opinions of the bureaus and departments are all willing to save money, reduce redundant personnel, streamline operations, and reduce all departmental budgets by 20%. The announced layoffs in various departments include more than 470 in the business department, more than 130 in the engineering department, more than 280 in the materials department, more than 90 in the machinery department, more than 20 in the general affairs department, and more than 30 in the land department. The total number is approximately 1,200, including more than 400 Chinese employees, more than 200 White Russians, and the rest are Soviets. However, it is said that the Russian personnel who are laid off all return to their home country, and at the same time, new personnel are investigated from their home country and appointed in their name to fill the positions. If this is the case, then only the Chinese employees and White Russians will be laid off. Although this statement is making a lot of noise in Harbin, it has not yet been seen in reality.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Wuhu Organizes a Party, Government, and Military Affairs Office <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Wuhu is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and serves as a shield for the capital. At a time when military progress is being made on the front lines, the security of the rear is particularly important. Ma Fuxiang, chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, who has been staying in the capital for a long time, recently returned to Anhui after being urged by the central government. When Ma passed through Wuhu, he summoned the director of the Public Security Bureau, Tang Shaogao, and the magistrate of Wuhu County, Sun Gongming, to discuss the maintenance of local security. At the same time, the central government, considering that Wuhu is a mixed area of Chinese and foreigners and that reactionary elements can easily hide, has already dispatched Huang Geng to Wuhu yesterday to organize the Wuhu Postal and Telegraph Inspection Office for strict inspection. In addition, Xiong Wenxu, member of the Anhui Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee and Minister of Propaganda, was ordered to come to Wuhu the day before yesterday to organize a joint party, government, and military affairs office in Wuhu to prevent reactionary elements. Xiong came to Wuhu and stayed at the Minguo Daily newspaper office, discussing the organizational law with various party and government agencies here for several days. The location is planned to be inside the Cloth Merchants' Guild, with separate secretarial, general affairs, and secret investigation groups. It has been decided to appoint five people as committee members: Provincial Propaganda Minister Xiong Wenxu, Wuhu Municipal Director Shao Yizhou, Public Security Bureau Director Tang Shaogao, County Magistrate Sun Gongming, and Sixth District Bandit Suppression Commander Lü Xueshu. The office will be declared established in one day. The expenses will be directly allocated by the province, and it is also planned to select outstanding members from the party members in the province to organize a propaganda team to go to various counties to propagate, so that the people can understand and assist in eradicating reactionaries. At an appropriate time, they will be dispatched to the bandit suppression command headquarters in various districts to carry out propaganda with the army. This measure will be implemented after the provincial government convenes a meeting of the bandit suppression commanders in various districts. (August 23rd)</p>

<p>The Anhui Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee telegraphed that the Seventh Standing Committee of the Provincial Reorganization Committee resolved that, in addition to the provincial agricultural association, the labor union, the women's association, and the Anqing labor and women's organizations, the Wuhu General Labor Union and other mass organizations should also be suspended and reorganized by dispatched personnel.</p>
<p>The Wuhu County government, in order to increase bandit prevention forces, prepared funds to purchase thirty rifles and five thousand rounds of ammunition from the Security Department of the provincial government. They have now arrived in the province. The county government yesterday sent Cui Chuqing as a representative to the province to collect and transport them. The General Chamber of Commerce here yesterday submitted a report to the Ministry of Communications, stating that the telephone poles and wires in Wuhu City have been decayed for a long time and often break and fall, causing fatal accidents. They earnestly request the Ministry to order the Wuhu City Telephone Bureau to quickly replace all decayed materials to maintain communication and ensure safety. Ma Fuxiang, chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, today accompanied Sun Shengwu, director of the Finance Department, on a river steamer from the capital to Wuhu to return to the province.

<p>A glimpse of rampant banditry in Jin County: Qianwei and Langxia in the neighboring Jinshan County have been areas where bandits frequently appear. Although the military and police have repeatedly suppressed them, they always hear the news in advance and flee, gathering and dispersing irregularly. Yesterday (the 22nd) at 1:00 p.m., more than one hundred bandits, armed with rifles and pistols, ravaged the three towns of Qianwei, Lüxiang, and Langxia, which is truly shocking to hear. This gang of bandits targeted Inspector Fei of Lüxiang because he was strict in investigating bandits, resulting in the bandits' anger. They sought revenge by robbing weapons and killing. They walked from Lüxiang and Langxia to Qianwei, surrounded the Public Security Bureau, robbed weapons, and then went to Lüxiang, where they again surrounded the local Public Security Station. Inspector Fei was the first to raise his gun and attack. One bandit was shot and seriously injured. The bandits fought Inspector Fei head-on. Fei was outnumbered and killed on the spot. The station's weapons were then robbed. This battle lasted several minutes. One gatekeeper was captured, and three policemen were injured. It is said that District Chief Jiang Lianjun was also killed. Six large boats docked in the river were all looted, including two pottery cargo ships, two bran ships, one oil tanker, and one rice ship, and six villagers were abducted as boatmen. Before leaving, they robbed drums and trumpets from the school and blew them away. Langxia Town was also affected. The police weapons were robbed, and all the wine jars piled up in the Hekang Sauce Garden in the town were smashed, using them as a source of amusement. The utensils in the home of store owner Zhu Liren were damaged, resulting in significant losses. Various places urgently notified the headquarters of the First Marine Police Team stationed in Songjiang by telephone. Captain Fan Guozhong was shocked by the news. In addition to reporting to the Minhang District Department, he immediately led more than ten naval vessels, towed by steamers, to the scene of the incident to search and pursue the bandits. In one day, they robbed three towns, robbed officials, and killed them, which is a first. It is truly a major robbery.</p>
<p>Airplane lands and damages itself after hitting a stone. A No. 19 aircraft encountered lightning and wind in the air the day before and was forced to land. However, the small training ground where it landed was too small, and the aircraft parts were accidentally damaged. Today, a Jiangyan aircraft flew to Songjiang to repair the No. 19 aircraft. The fuselage was also slightly damaged. Soon after, another Jiangyan aircraft drove to Songjiang. Currently, both the No. 19 and Jiangyan aircraft have driven to Shanghai, but the Jiangyang aircraft is still being repaired.</p>
<p>Another kidnapping case on the tidal mudflats of Fengjing. Yesterday (the 23rd) at about 5:00 a.m., a large band of bandits came to a place called Yibaoliutu in the tidal mudflats of Fengjing, riding on ten bandit ships. The bandits who landed numbered about sixty, and those who remained on the ships were also close to that number. They first looted four rifles from the area, fired a volley to demonstrate their power, and guarded the strategic passes. They broke into the home of village chief Xu Ruilin, looting wantonly and kidnapping the victim, Xu Ruilin, and taking him aboard the ship, demanding a ransom of 200,000. At the same time, the wife of the wealthy Wu Xiang, who was bedridden, was forced aboard the ship along with the ship and a boatman. Dai Jingru's son and the former head of the cabin, Wen, were also kidnapped because they had a feud with the bandits. In total, six people, including the boatman, were kidnapped. The Xu family suffered the greatest losses. After the looting, they sailed towards the Fanbang New Town area. A total of eleven ships, including the ship of the wealthy victim, were looted. The families of the victims were all at a loss. It is said that there were also reports of large-scale kidnappings in Zhangjingwan in Zhejiang Province. The rampant atmosphere of bandits can be seen.</p>
<p>The two kidnapped children of the Wang family have not yet escaped danger. The two children of the Wang family who were kidnapped in the Hougang kidnapping case are still in the bandit den. It is said that the Wang family received a letter from the bandits, but there was no news at the designated meeting place. The Wang family received another letter from the bandits the day before, accusing them of not being sincere in negotiating and threatening to burn down the entire town. This caused panic among the people in the town. However, the Wang family's financial situation has been strained in recent years, and it is difficult for them to raise the ransom demanded by the bandits. It is said that they have entrusted people to search everywhere to comfort the old mother who is looking forward to their return.</p>

<p>Wounded soldiers cured and sent to Beijing to return to their teams. Yesterday (the 24th), more than 240 wounded soldiers from the 15th Rear Hospital were discharged and sent to Beijing to return to their teams. When the train left at about 9:00 a.m., more than 50 people at the station refused to go to Beijing and asked to be sent to Shanghai instead. The rest disembarked when the train passed through Huguan. The 4th Regiment of the local military police heard the news and has dispatched a team to Huguan to arrest them. In addition, the perpetrator who injured the member of the defense corps with a gun in the Huqiu Garden was identified by the defense corps leader Ji Tianren yesterday and handed over to the inspection office for interrogation. A pistol was also found.</p>

<p>Progress on Establishing the County Court: The matter of establishing a county court in Xiyi (Wuxi) has, since the resolution of the court's location (the old Wuxi government office), been repeatedly addressed by the Higher Court, which dispatched Yao Guozhang, chief secretary of the Higher Court's prison section and preparatory officer for the county court, and Wang Yiming, secretary of the First Civil Tribunal, to Wuxi to design the court and raise establishment funds. Former County Magistrate Sun convened a meeting of various sectors to decide that the County Chamber of Commerce would subscribe 9,000 yuan and the Judicial Advancement Association would subscribe 2,000 yuan, to be paid in three installments. The 31st of this month is the deadline for the first installment. Higher Court President Lin, recognizing the urgency, especially dispatched Yao Guozhang and Jiang Yiming to Wuxi yesterday morning to negotiate the fundraising matters.</p>
<p>After disembarking, they immediately visited County Magistrate Pan, and then went to the Chamber of Commerce and the Judicial Advancement Association for discussions. The County Chamber of Commerce indicated that due to fundraising difficulties, the amount of 3,000 yuan for this installment might be difficult to approve. The Judicial Advancement Association agreed to pay the 1,000 yuan in full by the end of the month. At 5 p.m., Yao and Wang visited the county prison, detention center, and sub-detention center to inspect the inmates. They inquired in detail about the current state of the prison.</p>
<p>Suicide by Poisoning After Failed Loan Attempt: Qian Shaoqing, the 43-year-old owner of a water chestnut cake shop on Guanqian Street in the city, has recently been struggling due to slow business, causing him to borrow 100 silver dollars from his cousin Qian Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tongji Chun herbal medicine shop outside Guangfu Gate on Tongyun Road. Zhuxuan refused. Recently, he went to borrow again, but Zhuxuan happened to be in Shanghai on business. Shaoqing followed him to Shanghai. However, after arriving in Shanghai, Zhuxuan turned against him, refusing to acknowledge Shaoqing as his brother and calling the police to take Shaoqing to the police station, where he was fined 15 yuan. Shaoqing managed to raise the fine by the day before yesterday and was released by the police. He returned to Wuxi by car. Because of the failed loan and the police fine, he felt resentful and developed a desire to end his life. Yesterday at noon, he bought two yuan's worth of raw opium. At 6 p.m., he went to the Tongji Chun herbal medicine shop and sat silently. Qian Zhuxuan saw that he was weak and behaving strangely, and realized that he had taken poison. He rushed him to the Brothers Hospital for treatment, but his throat was already damaged and he could not be saved. At this time, Qian Shaoqing's sister, Lu Qian, and his sons, Jin Gen (17 years old) and Hai Gen (5 years old), had all arrived upon hearing the news. They ordered people to carry Shaoqing back to Zhuxuan's shop, where he died around 8 p.m., bleeding profusely from his nostrils. The scene was tragic. That night, Qian Zhuxuan and the head of the Tian San Tu district, Xi Zhiliang, reported to the county government. The county government, upon receiving the report, dispatched a trial officer and a Shen forensic officer on the morning of the 24th to conduct an autopsy. However, the family of the deceased has also made serious representations to Qian Zhuxuan, and it remains to be seen how this will be resolved.</p>
<p>Half-Day Strike at Qiantai Silk Factory: The Qiantai Silk Factory, located under the Gongyun Bridge on Liangxi Road outside Guangfu Gate, is solely owned by Cheng Bingruo of Wuxi and is generally doing well. However, its treatment of its workers is unusually strict, causing dissatisfaction among the female workers. The day before yesterday, the factory criticized the female workers for uneven silk thread, believing that if the work was not good, they should be guided instead of being reprimanded, which made them very angry. Yesterday morning (the 24th), a portion of the female workers went on strike, refusing to enter the factory to work and demanding improved treatment. Upon seeing this, the factory immediately reported to the Silk Factory Workers' Union, which dispatched officials such as Ding Shaochu to the factory to mediate with the factory's union official Wang Zengdi. A resolution was reached by noon, and the female workers agreed to return to work as usual this morning. The factory only works half a day in the morning due to the recent hot weather and stops working in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Gangsters Kill Each Other in the Northern Countryside: In the area of Lao Gu Bridge and Anjia She in the northern countryside of Wuyi County, gangsters are rampant. Villagers dare not only not speak of the gangsters, but also dare not travel during the day. Extortion and brutal killings are common. A villager named Liu recently received a gangster note demanding 1,000 yuan. After speaking to Bao Gen, who was associated with the gangsters, the matter was settled for 300 yuan. After the money was paid, Bao deducted 100 yuan and gave 200 yuan to the gangster leader. The gangster leader found out and was furious. He led the gangsters to Bao's house and searched it, finding several hundred yuan. Bao had been profiting from the situation more than once. The gangster leader immediately took Bao Fugen to Lao Gu Bridge and shot him dead. At the same time, a gangster named Xi Shunhai from Jiangyin was also shot for violating the rules of the gang. The families of the two gangsters went to collect their bodies yesterday morning (the 22nd) and prepared coffins for burial.</p>

<p>The Cause and Effect of the Market Strike in Xianzhen: The market strike by various shops in Xianzhen, a town under the jurisdiction of Yangzhou, was resolved on the 22nd. The main reason for the strike was that Dong Yan Pingqing and others, who were involved in the rice business in the town, saw that the Sanyuan Bridge was collapsing and the ferry was dangerous. They convened merchants from various industries at the Dasheng Temple to discuss raising funds to build a pontoon bridge. However, Director Zhang of the Public Security Fourth Sub-bureau, listening to biased reports, led police to the temple to search for gambling and opium, without any evidence. He arrested Yan and others. The public was outraged and refused to open the market until they were released. However, the sub-bureau director then reported to the Public Security Bureau that they were obstructing official duties and requested that the Public Security Bureau send armed police and Inspector Dai to investigate and arrest Yan and others. This led to a public market closure. Fortunately, the Director of the Public Security Bureau learned the truth, transferred the police back, and ordered the release of the detainees. The Chamber of Commerce then issued a notice that the entire town would reopen the market.</p>
<p>The Shocking News of Pawned Bombs: At about 10 a.m. on the 23rd, several people brought bombs to the Dunjin pawnshop to pawn them, asking for 50 yuan for each.

<h3 id="e81">Celebrating Victory in the Elimination of Communists and the Suppression of Wang Jingwei <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Public Prepares a Citizens' Congress</p>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Department Decides to Assist</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Committee's Propaganda Department held its 16th Municipal Propaganda Meeting at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday. Attendees included Yang Qingyuan, Cai Hongtian, and Li Zheng of the Municipal Propaganda Department, the propaganda commissioners of various districts, and over a dozen people including Zhu Shujian, Huang Xianggu, Yang Shaozhi, Feng Xiancheng, Diao Qing'en, Shen Risheng, and Mei Hongquan. The meeting was chaired by Minister Yang Qingyuan, with Zhou Hanmei as the recorder. The meeting began with the usual formalities. First, the chairman reported, stating that today was the 16th Municipal Propaganda Meeting. In the past week, the work of the Municipal Propaganda Department, in addition to sorting out documents, has also actively planned various movements. The Chinese Communist Party is still lurking in various places, engaging in harassment. Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and other provinces have been burned and looted. The recent discovery that the Director of the Nanchang Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is also a communist leader is even more shocking. At a time when the military suppression of the rebels is making great progress, such communist disturbances in the rear must be actively eliminated. The Central Government has now deployed three divisions to suppress them. However, to thoroughly eliminate the communists, the assistance of the public is essential, especially the workers and peasants. Recently, various provinces and cities have held anti-communist movements, with many people participating. With the joint efforts of the military and civilians to eliminate the communists, their elimination will naturally not be a problem. The people of this city are also actively preparing a Citizens' Congress to celebrate the victory in eliminating the communists and suppressing Wang Jingwei. It is hoped that comrades in various districts will provide the greatest assistance at that time, so that the anti-communist work can be thoroughly completed. Recently, the military in the front has reported great victories. Victory telegrams have been sent from both the Longhai and Pinghan lines. Jinan on the Jinpu Line has also been recovered. The remnant rebel troops of Yan and Feng are retreating, hoping to preserve their remaining forces. The military suppression of the rebels will soon end. The Central Government originally wanted to completely eliminate the rebel army, but considering that the generals and soldiers under Yan and Feng had all worked hard for the revolution and were misled by Yan and Feng, they issued a new warning, clearly stating that if the generals and soldiers of each unit can abandon the rebels and serve the government, they will not be held accountable for their past deeds. As for the two rebels, Yan and Feng, they cannot be forgiven by law, and the Central Government will not pardon them. Then, the propaganda commissioners of each district successively reported. Then, the discussions began. (1) In this suppression of the rebels, the generals and soldiers have been loyal and brave, and have captured famous cities one after another. Recently, they have recovered Jinan and are approaching Pingjin. Victory telegrams have also been sent from the Longhai and Pinghan lines. All districts should send telegrams of condolence to encourage them. It was decided that the districts should send telegrams of condolence separately. (2) The Shanghai Republican Daily is the only party newspaper in Shanghai. Recently, its behavior has been perverse, its news has been distorted, and it has disregarded the party's news, which has hindered the party's propaganda. It should urgently be submitted to the Municipal Propaganda Department and forwarded to the Central Government for rapid reorganization in order to rectify it and benefit propaganda. It was decided that (abridged). (3) The people of this city are preparing to hold a Citizens' Congress to celebrate the victory in eliminating the communists and suppressing Wang Jingwei. It was decided how the districts should assist in the process. 1. The propaganda commissioners of each district should convene an emergency district propaganda meeting within three days to report on the significance of the people holding the Citizens' Congress this time. 2. The propaganda commissioners of each district should supervise all party members in their respective districts to attend. (4) The case of reconfirming the meeting time of this conference was decided to be held every Saturday afternoon at 2 pm. The meeting adjourned.</p>

The rebels Yan and Feng have started a war and caused chaos, which is intolerable under Party discipline and national law. The public hates them with particular vehemence. Our central government, in accordance with public opinion, has launched a major campaign to suppress them. Wherever the righteous banner points, everything crumbles. Now that Tai'an has been captured and Jinan has been recovered, they are advancing to occupy Lanfeng and besieging Xuzhou and Zhengzhou. The three major armies on the Jinpu Railway, Longhai Railway, and Hankou are making steady progress, unstoppable. Sweeping away the bandits and destroying their lairs is just a matter of time. All these achievements are due to the brilliant command of our Commander-in-Chief Chiang, the effective leadership of Ding, and the dedication and selflessness of all the officers and soldiers. The frequent news of victory is celebrated by all, demonstrating that the army of the Three Principles of the People is invincible, and the rebels will eventually be annihilated. At this time, when the rebel army is demoralized and everyone is terrified, we hope you will continue to encourage the remaining courage and take advantage of the victory to pursue them, recover Peiping and Tianjin in the shortest possible time, and directly attack Shanxi and Shaanxi. Let the people live in peace and tranquility, then the roots can be eradicated, the rebellion can be completely eliminated, and we can see the peaceful situation again, so that there can be a unified situation.

Moreover, the elite of the rebel army has now been almost completely wiped out, and it is only a matter of time before we sweep away the bandits and destroy their lairs.

The Tenth Branch of the Fifth District of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Kuomintang of China.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Third District Party Headquarters: (Title omitted) Since the two rebels Yan and Feng successively rebelled, the peaceful and unified country was destroyed, and the people living in peace and working happily suffered as a result. Our central government, in order to seek the unification of the country and relieve the people from their suffering, sent troops to suppress and annihilate the major villains. News of victory came, and Tai'an and Jinan were successively recovered. The rebels fled in panic and were almost completely defeated. The rebels in the Longhai Railway and Pinghan Railway areas were also repeatedly defeated. It is only a matter of time before we directly attack Beiping and Tianjin. We hope that our Commander-in-Chief and all the officers and soldiers at the front will take advantage of the victory to pursue and severely punish the remaining rebels, and strive to eliminate all reactionary forces, so as to ensure the long-term peace and stability of the country. We send this telegram to express our support and await your triumphant return.

Yu Zhen presided over the meeting. Representatives from the Baoshan County Government and the Fourth District Water Police successively reported on the rampant pirates in the outer waters of Wusongkou. In general, it was said that Qidong Lvsisha outside Songkou is surrounded by water on all sides, with an island in the middle, covering about dozens of miles. There are 70 to 80 pirate ships parked in the sand, with more than 600 pirates. In addition, there are more than 100 pirate ships and about 1,000 pirates in Da'an Port, Haimen. They are fully armed and very well-equipped, and their organization is also very strict. According to the above-mentioned sandbanks, they are all shoals, and warships cannot enter, and the army is also out of reach. Therefore, these pirates are becoming increasingly rampant, either kidnapping ships for ransom or landing to loot, almost every day. If we want to thoroughly suppress them, we must advance by both land and sea to eliminate them. After discussion, it was decided to investigate the terrain of the sandbank and the details of the port, and then conduct a joint land and sea suppression.</p>

<p>Sixtieth Time</p>

Liu Zuwang served as chairman and Dai Jixian served as secretary. The meeting was held as usual. The proposals are recorded below: (1) Chairman's report: The meeting was convened today because more than 30 members, including Zhao Yuhuang and Li Shirui, sent a letter requesting the convening of a temporary general meeting to discuss how to deal with Attorney Zou Yu's defamation of the reputation of all members in court. Therefore, the executive and supervisory committees were convened to review first whether there is a need to convene a general meeting. After Committee Member Tang Yingsong proposed that the opinion of Attorney Zou Yu should be inquired first before reviewing the case, it was resolved that a letter should be sent to Member Zou Yu first, and the case should be reviewed after his reply.

<h3 id="e92">Coal Merchants Oppose Mandatory Levy of Treasury Bonds <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association, regarding the Coal Special Tax Bureau's mandatory levy of 20% of treasury bonds, sent five representatives to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday to petition and present receipts. Now, they have filed a series of appeals. The text of their petition is recorded as follows: "Presented to maintain order and prevent problems, please uphold justice. Since the Jiangsu Provincial Coal Special Tax Bureau implemented the mandatory levy of 20% of cigarette treasury bonds along with taxes on August 10th, actively forcing the collection, making the coal merchants, who are already suffering, almost driven to their deaths. Therefore, the public's feelings are indignant, as if a great disaster is about to come. The executive committee of the association has repeatedly advocated for a peaceful and legal opposition, advocating that the bureau be given the opportunity to automatically revoke the mandatory levy by September 5th. By that date, the bureau still could not resolve the issue. In accordance with the unanimous public opinion of the industry, they refused to pay the 20% cigarette treasury bonds levied along with taxes, which has been announced in the newspaper. It is feared that the bureau will still not cancel the levy by the deadline, and the coal merchants will inevitably refuse to pay. Under these circumstances, the bureau may use the name of tax resistance to enforce ship detention. Once the ships are detained, the coal merchants will inevitably be forced to suspend operations. If so, transportation and factories will inevitably be suspended, affecting the rear of the war and local order, which is by no means insignificant. If it unfortunately comes to this state, the responsibility should be borne by the Coal Special Tax Bureau. In order to prevent problems, the association hereby clarifies and respectfully requests your department to uphold justice and forward the matter to the Municipal Government and the Water and Land Public Security Bureau, so as not to assist in the detention of ships, so as to avoid trouble in the rear. The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters and the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau."</p>
<h3 id="e93">Foreign Merchants Monopolize the Tianjin Cigarette Industry <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Request Negotiation with the Consolidated Tax Bureau</p>
<p>The Cigarette Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, in order to cut off the source of cigarette tax in Hebei, has stopped issuing transportation permits for cigarette shipments to Hebei from today to show its resistance, as reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the Chinese Cigarette Factory Trade Association has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from members reporting that although the British-American Tobacco Company in Tianjin has taken the step of closing its factory to resist taxes, more than 20,000 boxes of cigarettes in its foreign warehouses have been secretly reported for tax payment by various managers and are being widely sold. At present, the area under the jurisdiction of Hebei has become a monopoly area for the British-American Tobacco Company, while Chinese cigarettes have been out of stock for more than ten days since the shutdown. There is still no news of lifting the ban, creating an excellent opportunity for foreign merchants. If the period is extended, business is worrying and solutions should be found. After receiving the report, the association immediately retrieved the original letters and telegrams from various companies in Tianjin and knew that the matter was true and was very angry. The foreign company is taking advantage of the situation, obeying superficially but disobeying secretly, indirectly undermining the bureau's orders and directly monopolizing the business. There could be no more improper competition. It is said that representatives have been publicly elected to inquire about solutions from the Cigarette Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. The following is a telegram from Tianjin: "It is found that the British-American Tobacco Company in Tianjin has more than 20,000 boxes of inventory. The managers are now paying the new tax. This transitional measure is obedient superficially but disobedient secretly, and Chinese merchants are sitting and waiting for death. The association should come forward and negotiate seriously with the tax bureau."</p>
<h3 id="e94">Products of the Provincial Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Institute <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Tax-Free Nationwide</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Institute in Suzhou is currently the only government-run agricultural implement manufacturing institution in China. Its diesel engines, kerosene engines, centrifugal pumps, rice milling machines, cultivators, new-style plows, row planters, etc., are well-made and low-priced. They have long been popular in various counties of the province. Agricultural institutions and farmers in other provinces, such as Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui, have also come to Suzhou from afar to purchase them to promote and popularize them. However, the products of the institute were already exempt from tax in the province with the special permission of the Ministry of Finance, but when they were transported out of the province, they still had to pay taxes, which was very expensive. Foreign provinces often hesitated because of this. The institute, in view of the decline of agriculture in China in recent years, and the improvement of agricultural implements cannot be delayed, and before the central government and various provinces have specially established agricultural implement manufacturing institutes, it is not appropriate to have regionalism for the needs of foreign provinces and to have discrimination. Therefore, it specially requested the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance, requiring that the products of the institute be tax-free nationwide. The Ministry of Finance has now approved it and has replied to the provincial government, saying, "This case was previously approved and forwarded to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, the Jiangsu Finance Special Envoy, and the Jiangsu Customs Superintendent, allowing tax exemption. This time, the request to order the financial departments, financial special envoys, and customs superintendents of various provinces to allow tax exemption nationwide is approved in order to promote agriculture in various provinces. In the future, the products of the institute can be tax-free nationwide, and both near and far can benefit from this tax exemption for agricultural implements, which will greatly benefit the promotion of new agricultural implements."</p>
<h3 id="e95">Inspection of Jiangbei Wheat Stopped <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangbei Branch of the Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining began inspection in Gaoyou on the 17th of this month. On that day, more than 300 ships transporting wheat arrived at Gaoyou Hexia. It took the institute two hours to inspect the wheat on one ship. The results of the inspection on that day showed that only one-tenth had been inspected. Feeling that the procedures were difficult and difficult to handle, the director of the branch went to the Wheat Merchants Association in person and stated that there was no room for accommodation in the handling procedures. In the future, when the wheat shops receive wheat, if they encounter wheat mixed with water and mud, they will hand it over to the branch for processing. Now, the branch has voluntarily stopped inspection. Regarding the opposition of domestic manufacturers to paying the inspection fee, they agreed to record it on the books and not pay it temporarily to show leniency. In fact, domestic flour mills are located in the wheat-producing areas, and they purchase raw materials at a loss. There is no reason to buy inferior goods. Shanghai manufacturers initially intended to request the Department of Civil Affairs to issue a strict ban in various counties of Jiangbei due to the occasional occurrence of water and mud mixing by wheat transport ships. Now that the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining has established an institute for inspection, it is indeed an urgent task to inspect and improve the quality of wheat in the hands of farmers. However, because it is abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the trivial, and the handling is difficult, Shanghai manufacturers have felt that they have lost the original intention of their request.</p>

<p>Disturbances by Wounded Soldiers in Jiashan Quickly Suppressed</p>
<p>The 34th Rear Hospital of the Army stationed in Jiashan has sent approximately 500 to 600 wounded soldiers from the front line for treatment. Unexpectedly, at about 7:00 PM the night before last (23rd), more than 100 wounded soldiers were discharged from the hospital and caused disturbances in the roads and streets. Local police and the Zhejiang Provincial Security Team went to suppress and stop them, resulting in a conflict. The wounded soldiers gathered more and more, intending to go to the Tenth Company of the Third Battalion of the Seventh Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Team in Yangwangmiao to rob weapons. The Security Team had already been prepared and patrolled in full force, stepping up security. The merchants and residents in the city all closed their doors. The Jiashan County Government sent a telegram to Hang Yi, Commander of the Jiaxing-Huzhou Bandit Suppression, for instructions. Commander Hang immediately transferred the First Battalion and Second Company of the Second Regiment of the Security Team stationed in Jiaxing, led by Company Commander Ye Muchao, with 160 soldiers, and Xu Pucheng, District Chief of the First District of the Water Police stationed in Jiaxing, sent a patrol team led by Team Leader Wang Deqing. They all set off from Jiaxing overnight to Jiashan to suppress the disturbances. At that time, the Tenth Company of the Third Battalion of the Seventh Regiment of the Security Team in Jiashan had surrounded the wounded soldiers and escorted them back to the 34th Rear Hospital. The situation was completely resolved by 10:00 PM, and local order was restored to normal. As a result, it was reported that seven or eight wounded soldiers were injured and eleven were captured, while two security guards were injured. At that time, the No. 9 night passenger train from Hangzhou to Shanghai on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway passed through Jiaxing Station. Knowing that there was a conflict between wounded soldiers and the police and military in Jiashan, the No. 9 night passenger train was detained in Jiaxing. It did not depart from Jiaxing until 11:15 PM. More than 100 patrolmen from the Second District Patrol Team of the Water Police stationed in Jiaxing accompanied the train to Jiashan for protection. Therefore, the No. 9 night passenger train arrived at Shanghai Station at about 1:00 AM the next morning (24th).</p>
<h3 id="e97">Construction of a Telegraph Machinery Manufacturing Plant <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation believes that the demand for telegraph machinery and materials by various telegraph bureaus is quite large. If all are ordered from overseas, it would be uneconomical and would not meet urgent needs. Therefore, it is planning to establish a telegraph machinery factory and a battery factory to meet the demand. The telegraph machinery factory will be located at the same site as the electrical material storage and transfer office on Avenue des Soeurs in the Public Concession. The battery factory will be located in Zhoujiadu, Pudong. The products of the two factories are still applicable. However, as it has been a long time, many of the original buildings have collapsed and urgently need repair. Moreover, the telegraph machinery factory accidentally caught fire this spring, destroying the buildings. However, various lathes and machines inside the factory were only superficially burned by the fire and were not damaged. Therefore, they were temporarily moved to Macgregor Road, and the machines and lathes were slightly repaired to resume work. However, the buildings there are not suitable for use as a factory, and the original site on Avenue des Soeurs is too narrow and also unsuitable. Furthermore, the Ministry had established a second factory on Rue Mgr Favier the previous year, specializing in the production of wireless telegraphs. Because it was renting private houses, the location was both narrow and unsuitable. The Pudong battery factory has a spacious site with ample remaining land to build a factory. Therefore, it was decided to rebuild the factory buildings within the battery factory, merging the telegraph machinery factory and the second factory, along with the battery factory, into one. This would not only facilitate communication but also save some money. The telegraph machinery factory was ordered to conduct an on-site survey, make detailed plans, prepare a construction plan and drawings, and invite merchants to submit quotations for review. All repairs to the dilapidated and damaged parts of the original battery factory buildings should also be included in the estimates for compilation. The factory reported that it had been approved and that the New Construction and Engineering Factory had contracted the project. It is expected to be completed five months after the start of construction. In order to expedite the process, the Ministry has merged the three factories in advance and renamed them the Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Plant. Lu Guixiang was appointed as the factory director, and Lin Jian, the original director of the first factory, was appointed as the engineer of the first workshop. Kang Qinggui was appointed as the engineer of the second workshop, and Hu Guoguang, the original director of the battery factory, was appointed as the engineer of the third workshop. The remaining design and material staff were assigned from the original employees of each factory. Before the new factory buildings in Pudong are completed, the office will be temporarily located at the original site of the second factory at No. 27 Macgregor Road.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Yesterday's News of the Labor Strike at the Nichihua Cotton Mill <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Company Announced the Factory Opening Three Times</p>
<p>The Labor Side Resolutely Resisted Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Labor Community Unanimously Offered Assistance</p>
<p>Since the Nichihua Cotton Mill in Pudong announced the opening of the factory for the second time, not a single worker has gone to work. Yesterday, it announced the opening of the factory again, but the labor side remained unmoved. Various labor unions in Pudong and Puxi jointly discussed assistance. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Pudong Labor Community Jointly Discusses Assistance: Various labor unions in Pudong, in view of the Nichihua strike that has lasted for more than a month without resolution, deeply fear the impact. At the same time, because they share the same position, they could not bear to sit idly by. Therefore, at 2:00 PM yesterday, they convened a joint meeting to discuss assistance and countermeasures. More than 30 representatives from the British American Tobacco Factory Labor Union, Xiang Sheng Iron Factory Labor Union, Steamboat Loading and Unloading Labor Union, Hengda Cotton Mill Labor Union, Shanghai Automobile Labor Union, and Cotton Textile Industry Labor Union attended. Zhao Bi chaired the meeting, and Xia Menghuan served as the recorder. After the formalities, the representative of the Nichihua Labor Union reported on the course of the strike and the various conspiracies and sabotage by the factory in collusion with running dogs during the strike. Then, the discussion began, and the following key points were decided: 1. Issue a letter to all the workers of Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai in the name of the conference, urging them to rise up and support the strike. 2. Petition the Shanghai Citizens' Training Association to convene a general assembly of representatives from all labor unions in Shanghai to establish a support association for the Nichihua strike. 3. Regarding economic assistance, in addition to the Pudong labor unions donating as much as possible, also request donations from all labor unions in Shanghai. 4. Send a letter to the Cotton Mill Labor Union to convene a general assembly of representatives from Japanese cotton mill workers in Shanghai. When necessary, all Japanese cotton mill workers in Shanghai should take concerted action to provide assistance. 5, 6, and 7 are confidential.</p>
<p>The Company Announced the Opening of the Factory Three Times: The workers of Nichihua are taking an unusually resolute stance in this strike. Therefore, even the cunning factory has been unable to cope. Therefore, at the beginning of the strike, it announced the opening of the factory. Later, it falsely claimed that it was at the request of all the workers and announced the opening of the factory. As a result, not a single worker went to work. Helplessly, it announced the closure of the factory to threaten the workers. However, the workers remained unmoved. The Japanese were forced to tear down the announcements in front of the factory a few days ago and post new announcements outside, declaring the opening of the factory, intending to make a final struggle. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese side is eager to open the factory, and at the same time, its counter-strategies have been exhausted. Therefore, apart from opening the factory today and opening the factory tomorrow, there is no other way.</p>
<p>The Puxi Labor Community Acts in Unison: The Japanese cotton mills in Puxi, in view of the unusually resolute strike by the workers of the Nichihua Cotton Mill this time, and having heard that the losses during this strike were subsidized by the Japanese Cotton Mill Federation, the workers, in order to express their dissatisfaction with the company, will also take concerted action. It is heard that unless the issue is resolved by the time the new cotton is released on the market, they will take concerted action to awaken the Japanese.</p>
<p>The Labor Side is Determined to Resist Japanese Goods: In view of the cunning and maliciousness of the Japanese merchants, the Labor Union of the factory, in order to awaken them, if the labor unrest is not resolved in the shortest possible time, it will be determined to engage in a boycott of Japanese goods movement. At the same time, it warns all sectors of the country, please unanimously advocate for this.</p>

<p>Workers at a civilian ship repair factory in Dongjiadu, Pudong, went on strike on the 23rd of this month due to demands for higher wages. It was recently heard from an official of the Siming Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association that the association's barges are exclusively used to transport coal and fuel to major factories and ships and cannot be interrupted for a single day. Once the ship factory goes on strike, the number of barges will be insufficient. It is heard that the association intends to urgently petition the Party, government, and military agencies for a resolution.</p>

<p>The Tragedy of an Overturned Car</p>
<p>Jia Zilin Seriously Injured and Died</p>
<p>The Other Three People are in Critical Condition</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 24th) morning at approximately 2:35 AM, a car suddenly crashed into a cement utility pole near Route Tenant de May and Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession, resulting in a tragedy of a destroyed car, a broken pole, one death, and three serious injuries. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Returning from a Banquet: Jia Zilin, a 40-year-old man from Pudong, currently residing at No. 24 Yuan Shang Li, next to the Tongren Fu Yuan Tang on Ningbo Road in the French Concession, used to work on ships. He has recently accumulated some savings and can be considered well-off. He is naturally charitable and has many friends. He owns a blue sedan, license number 11841, with a driver named Huang Xuelin, a 20-year-old man from Pudong. At approximately 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, Jia went to a banquet hosted by a friend with the surname of So-and-so in West Shanghai in his own car. After enjoying the banquet, he returned in the same car.</p>
<p>Flustered and Confused: There were four people in the car, one was the host Jia Zilin, one was Jia's nephew He Genfa, one was a relative Chen Liangcai, and one was the driver Huang Xuelin. Jia and the driver were sitting together in the front, and He and Chen were sitting together in the back. The car was traveling from west to east at full speed. Because West Shanghai is sparsely populated, the driver was driving boldly. Unexpectedly, when traveling on Route Tenant de May, there was a black-plated car in front, also traveling east. Jia's car, because of its strong speed, quickly overtook the car in front. Shortly after leaving ten yards away, near Rue Paul Beau, Jia's driver suddenly became flustered and confused. Due to momentary carelessness, he drove the car straight into a cement utility pole on the side of the road. The force of the impact was immense, and a tragedy ensued.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Tragedy: When the car hit the utility pole, the pole was broken and fell, completely destroying the car's engine, headlights, and thick glass. The car body and the glass on three sides were also damaged. As a result, the people in the car were unable to escape and were trapped inside, with their heads broken, flesh torn, brains splattered, hands broken, feet fractured, and blood flowing everywhere. All four were in extreme pain and unconscious. Fortunately, the black-plated car behind saw that Jia's car had caused an accident and immediately stopped. Two people in the car got out and saw the tragic situation. They immediately ordered the driver to put the injured people into the car and send them to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The two people hired another car and left.</p>
<p>One Dead and Three Injured: After the doctors immediately performed surgery and treatment, Jia Zilin died due to a fractured skull and splattered brains. He was already dying when he arrived at the hospital. He died about an hour later. The driver, Huang Xuelin, broke one leg and was seriously injured. The nephew, He Genfa, was blinded in one eye, and his body was also seriously injured. The relative Chen Liangcai broke his arm, and his face and chest were also injured. It is difficult to determine temporarily whether their lives are in danger. Jia's body was transported to his original home at Yuan Shang Li at approximately 8:10 AM yesterday by the hospital's white car, where the funeral was held.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Yesterday Noon on Xinxinqiao Street <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Robbers Attempt Murder</p>
<p>Money Saved</p>
<p>Ma Alai Died Tragically</p>
<p>Yesterday at approximately 11:00 AM, a robbery and murder case occurred on the third floor of the Baokang Small Restaurant at No. 287 Xinxinqiao Street (i.e., Rue du Pont). The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Taking a Break to Smoke: The Baokang Small Restaurant at No. 287 Xinxinqiao Street along the road is dedicated to serving general coolies. The house has a total of four floors and houses more than ten families. The front building on the third floor was rented to Chen Quanfu (37 years old) from Ningbo two months ago to open a Yanzike (opium den). Chen had a smoker named Ma Alai (47 years old) from Shaoxing who was in the business of buying paper ingot ashes. He currently lives at No. 179 Guoqing Road, Zhabei. Chen always takes a break to smoke at Chen's place after work, as is his custom.</p>
<p>Gun to the Waist: At approximately 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Ma and a group of friends first went to the Tonghe Tai Tinware Store on Pi Shao Nai Road, Xiaobeimen, to collect a payment of 350 yuan. Then, he went directly to Chen's place to smoke. He took out 85 yuan and paid it to his friends, asking them to leave first. The remaining 265 yuan were wrapped up and put in his pocket. At that time, Chen was preparing his opium pipe. Unexpectedly, two young men, one wearing a black gauze shirt and pants and the other wearing a white shirt and pants, both around 20 years old, suddenly broke in from downstairs. As soon as they saw Ma lying on the couch, the one in black took out a pistol from his sleeve and pressed it against Ma's waist.</p>
<p>Shot and Fell to the Ground: At that time, Ma knew he had encountered a robbery, but he just held on tight to his waistband and did not say a word. At that time, Chen got up and was about to intercede on his behalf. However, the one wearing white had already hurriedly exited the room. The robber with the gun, in desperation, pulled the trigger. With a bang, the bullet had already entered his waist. Ma fell in response. Chen, seeing the robber holding a pistol, did not dare to pursue him. He could only turn around and first protect the injured. At that time, there were only Chen's wife and a young child in the room. Chen urgently carried Ma downstairs, hired a rickshaw, and sent him to the Dazimingzhong police station. After the police chief briefly asked some questions, he transferred Ma to Renji Hospital.</p>
<p>Died in the Hospital: When Ma arrived at the police station, he temporarily deposited the 265 yuan along with a passbook at the police station. By approximately 3:00 PM, Ma's wife had heard the news and rushed over. She went to the hospital to meet Ma. At this time, he was still able to speak and his mind was clear. He died at 5:00 PM. The hospital notified the police station to transport the body to the Tongren Fu Yuan Tang morgue and report it to wait for today's examination. It is heard that the deceased's family is poor and only has one son.</p>

<p>Jin Rongling Suffers from Mental Illness</p>
<p>Commits Suicide by Throwing Himself into the Huangpu River After Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>Jin Rongling, 24 years old, from Meizhou, Yunnan, is currently studying in Japan. He usually lives at No. 1408 Ohara, outside Tokyo. He has a friend in Shanghai named Yang Gengguang, who lives at No. 1251 Route Lafayette in the French Concession. Recently, for some unknown reason, Jin suddenly suffered from severe mental illness. Therefore, his classmates planned to find a way to send him back to China. The day before, they lodged Jin at the Sugimoto Inn and bought a ticket for the Shanghai-bound Mikasamaruno ship to send Jin back to China to stay at his friend Yang's place for treatment. The ship was sailing in the ocean, and Jin suddenly called out to the ship's tea server, Wang Ashun, asking him to go ashore together. Wang was shocked to hear this and told him that they were still in the ocean, so where would there be land? Jin still wanted to land. Wang knew he was crazy and could not be reasoned with. Therefore, he locked him in the cabin to prevent accidents. Yesterday at approximately 12:00 noon, the ship arrived in Shanghai. Just as it was preparing to dock at the China Merchants North Wharf, Jin had already regained his freedom and suddenly jumped into the Huangpu River to commit suicide. He could not be rescued and sank without a trace. After docking was completed, the ship telegraphed the water police station to send investigator Wu Rongsheng on board to investigate the suicide. He reported back to the police station, and the police chief instructed him to notify his friend Yang Gengguang and inform the deceased's family.</p>

<p>Jumps into the Huangpu River and Dies</p>
<p>Two Suicide Notes with Sparse Words</p>
<p>Yesterday at approximately 3:00 PM, a young man wearing a white short shirt and pants hailed a rowboat owned by Ding Jixi, a man from Shandong, at the Yangjingbang Wharf, saying he wanted to cross the river to Pudong. When they reached the middle of the Huangpu River, he suddenly left a straw hat, a handkerchief, a fountain pen, a ballpoint pen, a pair of glasses, and a letter in the boat. He kept calling out (Why is it so hot today?), and while saying this, he walked to the bow of the boat. Taking advantage of the rower's unpreparedness, he suddenly jumped into the Huangpu River to commit suicide. His body sank without a trace. The rower was unable to rescue him. Therefore, he sent all the items he left behind to the water police station and stated the circumstances of the young man's suicide. The police chief examined the cover of the suicide note, which read: To Mr. Zhao Yixiao, No. 5 Wenfuli, not far from Zhongxing Road, Zhabei. Inside were letters to his parents and aunt, and a business card with the printed words Zhao Bingying, Executive Committee Member of the Shanghai Commercial Middle School Student Union. The suicide note was also signed Bingying. Therefore, it is undoubtedly known that the deceased's name is Zhao Bingying. However, the reason for the suicide is temporarily unknown. The police chief ordered investigator Wu Rongsheng to go to the address to investigate the deceased's family and verify the information. The two suicide notes are transcribed below:</p>
<p>To My Parents: Dear Parents, Your unfilial son is no longer in this world. I will repay your kindness in raising me as a dog or horse in the next life. After you receive this letter, please come and collect my body. Before I jumped into the river, I was preparing that money at home. Some of it was borrowed from him, and now I have returned it to them. So that money was used to repay others and for suicide. Some of it was used to buy opium to eat, but it was the same as not eating it. So I jumped into the river. The inn I rented on the 22nd was the inn next to the North Ocean Inn at the railway station. I don't know the signboard. These two letters were also written inside. I used the pseudonym Chen Ruikang, 20 years old, studying. Alas, I have probably enjoyed all the happiness in the world. Therefore, I really feel that there is no taste in this world. I have no choice but to commit suicide. I hope that after I die, you will not be sad and resentful. I will be happy in the underworld. Otherwise, will it increase my sins? I respectfully wish you good health and a good appetite. From your son Bingying, August 23rd. To My Aunt: Dear Aunt, I have jumped into the Huangpu River to commit suicide. After I die, please don't miss me. My parents in Shanghai, I am afraid that something unlucky will happen. I must ask you to serve them, the two old people. Please, please. From your nephew Bingying, August 23rd.</p>

<p>The Pirate Ship Has Not Left the Sand</p>
<p>The family of Su Guoliang, a resident of Changyinsha in Changshu County outside Wusongkou, is the richest in the area and has long been coveted by pirates. In the late evening of the beginning of this month, four large five-masted pirate ships suddenly sailed from the outer sea to the sand. The ships carried a total of more than 200 pirates. They immediately landed on the shore, openly armed with weapons, and went to Su's house to loot. They kidnapped all eight members of Su's family, men, women, and children. Su was away from home on business, so he was lucky enough to avoid being kidnapped. After the incident, the pirate ships anchored in the Xiaochagang port of the sand and sent pirates to contact Su, demanding a ransom of 150,000 yuan. Su only agreed to pay 80,000 yuan. Therefore, after many days, there has been no result, and the pirate ships are still on the sand, not going far. Yesterday, Lin Cha, the captain of the 18th team of the 4th district of the Wusong water police, reported the above information and had dispatched patrol ships to suppress the pirates.</p>

His wife, Liu Xianzhu, claims that Tang neglects his duty of support and has abused her, making it unbearable to live together. She requested the Special District Court to grant a divorce. After a previous hearing, Tang stated that he was too poor to remarry and did not want a divorce. The court ordered both parties to reconcile outside the court, but Liu was determined and willing to give Tang 200 gold coins to help him remarry, hoping to end the marriage as soon as possible. However, Tang demanded 1,000 gold coins, making reconciliation impossible. Another hearing was held the other day. The plaintiff's lawyer explained the reason for the failed reconciliation. Judge Xu suggested that the plaintiff increase the compensation to 400 yuan, but Liu claimed that she did not have that much money and that she had not received adequate support from Tang in the ten years they had lived together. She said that she would have to find a way to raise the 200 yuan she had offered. Tang stated that his goal was to stay together and that he did not want money. The plaintiff said that if he neglected her support, he could give her 25 yuan per month from his salary starting from now, and there would be no need for a divorce. However, the plaintiff ultimately disagreed. Judge Xu then ordered the lawyers of both parties to begin the debate and announced that the verdict would be announced this morning.</p>

The Hall's property includes a row of bungalows north of the District Court, with two rooms rented out by Tian Jinshan from Nantong as a sub-landlord. In 1928, Wu Baodi represented the Fuyuan Hall in suing Tian Jinshan in the District Court for owing more than 200 yuan in rent, requesting a judgment for compensation and eviction. The court ruled in favor of Wu Baodi's request, ordering Tian Jinshan to vacate the house. Tian Jinshan lost the lawsuit repeatedly, so he harbored a grudge against Wu Baodi. He once poured feces in Wu's office, which Wu reported to the police, and Tian Jinshan was arrested. Tian Jinshan was subsequently sentenced to two months of imprisonment by the court. After his release, Tian was still unwilling to give up. He went to Wu's office daily with a written grievance on his back. Later, he was detained and confined in a reformatory for more than half a year, but was eventually released again. After his release, Tian still refused to give up. He repeatedly sued Wu Baodi in court, saying that he did not owe rent and that the rent receipt had been stolen, etc. However, the court rejected his claims five or six times because they were unsupported. However, Tian still did not give up and filed a complaint with the Jiangsu Higher Court, accusing Wu Baodi of having local bully behavior and hobbies, etc. The Higher Court believed that since a lawyer was accused, the truth should be investigated, so it sent the case back to the District Court for investigation. The Prosecutor's Office dispatched Prosecutor Yang Wenjun to handle the case. The other day, a summons was issued, scheduling a preliminary hearing for the investigation court on the morning of the 27th of this month.</p>

On the morning of the 14th of this month, he was carrying flowers and riding a bicycle from west to east. As he was passing the roadside in front of the foreign gun club on the west side of Hongqiao Road, three people suddenly blocked his way.

<p>Request No Wage Cuts</p>
<p>Present Three Conditions</p>
<p>Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, all military uniforms and other supplies needed by the National Army have generally been prepared in Shanghai, and the general contractor distributes them to various factories for manufacturing. Therefore, a portion of the garment industry has become specialized in the production of military uniforms. There are eight groups, namely Ningbo, Hangzhou, Yangzhou, Hubei, Shanghai (i.e., local group), Pudong, etc. There are more than fifty workers in total. However, these workers have no organization. Recently, due to wage cuts by the factory, they used the name of military uniform workers from various groups to send messages to various factories, requesting that no further cuts be made to maintain their livelihoods. The original letter stated: "We, the military uniform manufacturing workers, have been increasingly impoverished due to repeated wage cuts by the factory. For example, the wage for each set of gray military uniform trousers was originally 17.5 cents, but was later reduced to 16 cents, then to 15 cents, and then to 12 cents. Now it has been reduced to only 10 cents. The wage for each set of gray interlined trousers was reduced from 18 cents to 13.5 cents. The gray cotton interlined shell, white shirt trousers, and coat interlined shell have also been reduced to 9 cents. The wage for each pair of interlined socks has been reduced to 4.5 cents. The wage for each cartridge belt has been reduced to 4.5 cents. With such repeated reductions, and the need to apply lining, and at a time when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood is as expensive as cassia, and prices are rising, the cost of living is increasing daily. The wages of other workers in commerce and industry are increasing year by year, but the wages of us military uniform workers are decreasing and not increasing. If this continues, our livelihoods will be cut off. We have no choice but to request the following requests: (1) No further wage cuts in the future, (2) Wages must be paid on the 15th and 30th of each month, (3) Increase the wage for each large piece by 5 li and for each small piece by 2 li or more." Please indicate your accommodation within the shortest period of time. "We are grateful," etc.</p>

<p>South Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry The South Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry vigorously promotes domestic product publicity. Currently, foreign merchants sell Gu Yin brand cigarettes in boxes of ten, through salesmen with trays, to the front of various industry shops, hindering the livelihoods of colleagues. The boxes are printed with the words "Made in China," which is obviously imitating the name of Chinese merchants and harming the Chinese people's psychology of promoting domestic products. The association has previously sent a letter to the association, requesting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to investigate and prohibit it in order to safeguard the rights of Chinese merchants. The association has submitted a report to the superior authorities for processing. It is heard that the company has received this news and has withdrawn the trays. A part of Nanshi held another meeting yesterday to report on the progress of the work. The following proposals were made: (1) The tax bureau's treatment of colleagues in the Chinese Concession is unfair. The formalities for Chinese tobacco must be checked and stamped, which is cumbersome and costly. As for foreign merchants selling tobacco, they feel that it is convenient. Resolved: Request the association to submit a request to the government for a ruling in order to unify and avoid suffering. (2) The investigators asked colleagues to investigate their names, the amount of capital, and the total number of cigarette sales. The registration has already been registered, but the Social Bureau has not yet registered the industry registration. What is their intention? Resolved: Send a letter to the association to inquire about the details. (Finally) The promotion of domestic products should continue to be vigorously promoted, and other important cases were discussed and dispersed.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to inform you that the report on the collision between the Jiangjing and Daji ships as published in your newspaper these past few days does not match the facts. According to what happened, the two ships were sailing from the lower reaches to Shanghai at 5:25 AM on the 21st. The Daji was in front and the Jiangjing was behind, passing the first buoy in Dashatou. The Daji was moving towards the buoy, so it took a slight turn, and had already reached the second buoy. The Jiangjing did not turn, but continued straight ahead. The Daji sounded two signals as a warning, but the Jiangjing still continued straight, and suddenly crashed into the Daji's stern from the left, causing great damage to the second and third decks and the lower iron plate of the Daji. The bow of the Jiangjing was also slightly damaged. The Shanghai Customs Officer and the Hesperus are currently inspecting the loss to both ships. We will determine the measures to be taken after investigating the faults of both parties, and therefore, we especially send this letter to correct the record. I hope you will publish it in the letter section. Best regards, Shanghai Dada Steamboat Company, August 24.</p>

<p>China Expedition</p>
<p>Soccer Team Ties Surabaya China</p>
<p>One to One... Eleventh Battle Report</p>
<p>(Surabaya, August 6) After two victories by the China Expedition Soccer Team in Surabaya, their reputation has been revived. Therefore, in the third match (Wednesday) against the China Club, everyone expected the China Expedition Team to win. Those who used the soccer match for gambling all gave China one to two goals. Unexpectedly, it ended in a tie, which is a pity. The fact is that the strength of the Chinese Expedition Team and the Chinese Second Team, whether in attack or defense, was superior. In terms of soccer skills, the Chinese Team was far behind. The Chinese Team was only diligent and commendable, and they gave their all in rushing and defending, which resulted in a tie. In addition, the China Expedition Team's front line was unwilling to be too pressing, seemingly to save some face for the Chinese Team. Whenever the Chinese goal was in danger, Dai, the center forward, and the left winger would not rush to attack, but just stand by and watch. If they had been as brave as when they played against the national team, the number of times they would have been broken through would have been countless. From the surface of this 70-minute battle, there were mutual attacks and defenses, and the strength was comparable, but in terms of actual skills, the Chinese Team was far inferior to the China Expedition Team. It was lucky that they could tie.</p>
<p>(1) Reduced Spectators on Non-Holidays</p>
<p>Today is not a holiday, and spectators from various ports are unable to come from afar. Many local spectators are also tied up by official duties, so they cannot attend as scheduled, so it is almost half empty. It is said that the income is also 5,000 to 6,000 shields.</p>
<p>(2) The Two Chinese Teams Enter the Field One After Another</p>
<p>At 4:30, the China Expedition Team, led by Li Qiu Gui, entered the field and tried their heads and feet. The Chinese Team also followed. The two Chinese teams took a group photo first. After the photo, the president of the Chinese Club presented a flower garden to Qiu Gui and said a few words. After the speech, the referee blew the whistle to arrange the formation. Each team held one side. The China Expedition Team faced east, and the Chinese Team faced west. They were ready to go. The formations of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>The Two Chinese Squads</p>
<p>China Expedition China</p>
<p>Goalkeeper Zhou Xianyan Chen Fuyi Defender Li Ning Chen Zhenfa</p>
<p>Defender An Yuansheng Zhang Xianmei</p>
<p>Right Defender Fu Xiangqing Lu Qingzuo</p>
<p>Center Defender Sun Sijing Zhang Shilong</p>
<p>Left Defender Chen Zhenhe Zhang Xianyuan</p>
<p>Right Winger Cao Guicheng Xie Shilu</p>
<p>Right Forward Chen Yutian Lin Yongzhong</p>
<p>Center Forward Dai Linjing Wei Wenlin</p>
<p>Left Forward Li Huitang Li Bingyuan</p>
<p>Left Winger Chen Guangyao Zheng Hongren</p>
<p>(3) The Two Armies Open Fire Under the Mobilization Order</p>
<p>At 4:25, under the mobilization order, the two armies opened fire. The center forward Dai passed the ball to attack, passing left and right, which was extremely fast. In an instant, they had reached the Chinese city. The Chinese rear resisted with all their might, but was rejected. The Chinese front counterattacked, and the momentum was extremely violent, but the China Expedition Team's defense was well-organized and difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>(4) The Battle is Fierce and Both Sides are Tense</p>
<p>Around 4:45, the China Expedition Team launched a major attack, using the technique of lightning speed. In an instant, they reached the Chinese heart. General Cao broke through the formation and went straight in, passing horizontally in the middle. The center forward and left forward could not catch up as scheduled, and the good opportunity was lost. The Chinese goalkeeper passed the ball to the center. The front line received the ball, like a rushing tide, passing left and right, and went straight to the dangerous area of the China Expedition Team. Fortunately, Zhou Tie, the goalkeeper, was quick-witted and quick-footed, and was able to turn danger into safety. (5) Bingyuan Takes Advantage of the Opportunity to Score a Goal</p>
<p>At 4:58, the China Expedition Team surrounded China, attacking from front and back, leaving the defense empty. After the Chinese Team saved the ball, the right winger Shilu broke through the formation and counterattacked along the edge. The five forwards went up together. When they reached the dragon gate boundary, Shilu passed the ball in the center. The China Expedition Team failed to return in time. The left forward Bingyuan caught up, jumped up and headed it in. Zhou Tie, the goalkeeper, was unable to save it, and it went into the net. After the China Expedition Team was scored a goal, the front line tried its best to counterattack in order to retaliate, surrounding China, so that Fuyi could not cope with it. General Cao broke through the formation repeatedly, and the Chinese defense was terrified. Fortunately, the lucky star arched the Chinese dragon gate, and the China Expedition Team was unable to achieve its goal. At 5:10, General Cao received the ball and went straight up along the edge, entering the heart and passing in the center. Center forward Dai rushed to the ball and shot hard with his feet. The ball did not go into the net, but went over the gate. It was a pity that the good opportunity was lost. Then they fought again. The China Expedition Team was stronger, and the Chinese Team was still trapped. Just when the defense was urgent, the referee blew the whistle to rest. In the first half, China took the lead with a score of one to zero.</p>
<p>(6) Chen Jiaqiu Replaces Fu Xiangqing</p>
<p>In the second half, the battle continued. At 5:20, right forward Fu Xiangqing was injured in the leg and could not continue to play. Chen Jiaqiu was replaced. After the contact, the battle became more intense. The China Expedition Team tried to retaliate, while the Chinese Team wanted to maintain its victory. The battle was very interesting to watch.</p>
<p>(7) Chen Jiaqiu Turns Danger into Safety</p>
<p>At 5:30, when the China Expedition Team focused on the left defense, the Chinese left winger Hongren passed the ball in the center. Right forward Lin Yongzhong caught up, only inches away from Zhou Tie, the goalkeeper. Yongzhong delayed slightly, and Chen Jiaqiu caught up and kicked the ball out of bounds, turning danger into safety. After the war, the China Expedition Team's front line lost its fighting spirit and no longer tried its best to trap the enemy, but only dealt with it. In order to preserve its victory, the Chinese Team attacked and defended to the death.</p>
<p>(8) Qiu Gui Ties the Game with One Kick</p>
<p>At 5:37, right winger Cao made another major counterattack. The sharpness was enough to make the enemy afraid. He rushed and broke through the formation as if entering an uninhabited area. When he approached the dragon gate, he passed the ball in the center according to the scale. Li Qiu Gui received it and swept it towards the dragon gate. Chen Fuyi's defense was incompetent, and it went into the net. (9) No Gains or Losses in the Continued War</p>
<p>Continuing the battle, the China Expedition Team was plagued by the lucky star. Although the strength was strong, the goal was difficult to achieve. Therefore, when the referee blew the whistle to end the game, the score was still a one-to-one tie. After the game, all the trophies were issued by Consul Guo to Li Qiu Gui, the captain of the China Expedition Team. The spectators returned home satisfied. The cheers of the spectators continued along the street until they reached the hotel.</p>
<p>(10) The China Expedition Team Gains New Recruits</p>
<p>Since the China Expedition Soccer Team could not cooperate with the South China Association, they changed to selecting good players from overseas Chinese soccer teams. According to their leader Yu Hengzhi, the new recruits already include Ya Jiu, Wen Li, Ya Hui, Song Ling, Xulong, and Chen Meian.</p>

<p>Lost to Portugal 2-3 Yesterday</p>
<p>Today's Singles Match with Portugal Decides Finals Spot</p>
<p>British Singles Win Secures Finals Spot Against America</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the third act of the Shanghai Rotary Cup Tennis Tournament, featuring the doubles team from China against Portugal and the singles teams from Britain and America. Britain's Wheatley defeated America's Squire 3-1. Over the past three days, Britain has won two singles matches and one doubles match, losing only one singles match. Having secured a 3-1 victory, Britain has earned the right to compete in the finals and will not play today, preparing instead for the final showdown. The Chinese doubles team fell short of victory, ultimately losing to the Portuguese team 2-3. Consequently, the fate of China and Portugal in their fight for a finals spot will depend on the outcome of today's matches.</p>
<p>(1) Britain Secures Finals Spot 6|4</p>
<p>6|4</p>
<p>(British) Wheatley ○|6 Squire</p>
<p>6|○</p>
<p>The strength of Britain and America is almost equal. Britain, relying on the efforts of veteran Wheatley, who participates in both singles and doubles matches, has succeeded in all three events, achieving a 3-1 victory over Britain and securing a spot in the finals. In recognition of their contributions, veteran Wheatley deserves the top spot.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the match, both sides showed their skills and held their ground. Each player held an advantage when serving, and the number of games progressed evenly. Neither side yielded, resulting in a 4-4 tie. Then, Squire was the first to break the deadlock, ultimately failing with a self-inflicted error. With the balance broken, Wheatley added another game, winning the first set 6-4.</p>
<p>In the second set, Wheatley's momentum continued, achieving favorable results in every match. Their amazing skills were evident in their self-inflicted errors and victories against the enemy. Soon, they held a commanding lead of 5-1. Squire, young and strong, fought back hard, unexpectedly winning three consecutive games, narrowing the difference to 4-5. Wheatley, mature and steady, continued to demonstrate their skills and successfully completed the set, winning again 6-4.</p>
<p>In the third set, Squire's spirit was strong, moving swiftly as if a brilliant first set was occurring. The veteran Wheatley, enjoying the spoils of victory, lacked energy, making the outcome even easier to achieve. One of the most distinctive features was their sudden advance to the net during the back-and-forth rallies, succeeding in every situation, both left and right, thus winning the set 6-0. During this match, the audience, including the British, were fascinated and amazed.</p>
<p>After three sets, a brief rest was taken. Not long after, the players returned to the court and the intense battle resumed. Considering Wheatley's defeat in the third set due to age and fatigue, most observers believed Squire had a chance in the fourth set. However, Wheatley's physical strength had already recovered. Their forehand and backhand returns were varied, and Squire struggled to move forward amidst the difficulties, losing game after game until they suffered a complete defeat of 0-6. As a result, Britain's Wheatley won 3-1.</p>
<p>(2) Portugal Wins One Doubles Match Against China</p>
<p>6|3</p>
<p>5|7</p>
<p>(Portuguese) Canavero Collaco Da|2</p>
<p>2|6</p>
<p>6|2</p>
<p>Given the circumstances yesterday, Portugal had no ambition to defeat China, knowing they were not as strong. The point of attention was to vie for one or two victories in the four singles and one doubles matches to maintain the Portuguese reputation in Shanghai. Since China sent Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai to participate in the singles matches, the thought of winning the singles matches was dismissed. The only hope was to concentrate all efforts on the doubles team. The day before yesterday, both sides had a draw and canceled the rematch. Yesterday, they fought for two and a half hours and finally won 3-2.</p>
<p>The match between China and Portugal attracted great attention from the audience, as their strengths were comparable, making it difficult to predict the outcome. The final victory depended entirely on the efforts of both sides. Initially, China and Portugal each won a set, remaining equal. Suddenly, they entered a close-quarters battle, striking the net back and forth, swift as shooting stars and fast as flying swallows. Later, Portugal adopted a lob strategy, repeatedly breaking through the Chinese line, taking a 4-1 lead. Jiang's serve was powerful, and Zheng's net play was effective, allowing them to win back one set. At that time, the two teams were neck and neck, each winning another set, bringing the score to 5-3, with Portugal leading. Jiang and Zheng were full of energy, showing signs of a turnaround. However, due to a strategic error, they both attacked the stronger players on the opposing side, ultimately losing the first set 3-6. In the second set, Jiang Daozhang gained the upper hand, winning the first game. Portugal won two games, surpassing them. Soon, the score became 2-2. Later, Jiang and Zheng's line was not solid, resulting in pressure from the enemy, unable to turn the tide, losing three consecutive games, placing the overall situation in danger, becoming a disadvantage of 2-5. Suddenly, Jiang and Zheng's momentum gradually shifted, and the cooperation was better. The Portuguese were instead controlled, losing the ability to move freely, suffering a crushing defeat. China won back a set 7-5. In the third set, Jiang and Zheng's strength declined significantly, differing greatly from the previous set, like heaven and earth. After winning in the second game, they repeatedly lost opportunities, leading to a disadvantage of 1-5. They then won back one game. The remaining games lacked any excitement, while the Portuguese were vigorous and astonishing. In the third set, Portugal won 6-2. After the three sets, both teams took a short break and began the fourth set. Jiang and Zheng were confident and acted nimbly. Apart from losing the first game, they were successful in every subsequent match. Portugal was in great danger and suffered one defeat after another. In this set, Jiang and Zheng were most satisfied, winning 6-2. The fifth set was the critical moment for both teams. The Portuguese acted cautiously, taking the upper hand each time. Jiang and Zheng made numerous mistakes, and despite fighting hard, they only won back two games, ultimately losing 2-6. As a result, Portugal won the doubles match 3-2. (3) Today's China-Portugal Singles Match</p>
<p>Starting at 4 PM today, China will compete against Portugal in a singles match. China's Qiu Feihai and Bei Baohua will both participate, and they are likely to win. Also, since Britain has already secured a spot in the finals, there is no need for the singles match between Britain and America.

<p>The Ministry of Education, upon the order of the Executive Yuan, announced that the budget preparation for the 18th year would continue to be implemented according to the budget regulations of the 17th year. The circular was sent to national universities and the education departments of various provinces and cities. The Executive Yuan's 2970th order stated, "Regarding the matter, the Executive Yuan presented, 'Regarding the transfer of the matter, the Ministry of Finance presented, 'The 18th year has now ended. It is proposed that the preparation of all final accounts continue to be implemented in accordance with the budget regulations of the 17th year in order to facilitate convenience.

Upon investigation, the case of preparing the final accounts for the 17th year had previously been drafted by this department in accordance with the regulations and formats, and submitted to your esteemed court for transfer to the National Government for promulgation. Subsequently, due to the failure of various agencies inside and outside the capital to submit them on time, this department again received approval to extend the deadline by three months and separately issued reminders. To date, the extended deadline has been exceeded, and the submissions from various agencies are still incomplete. Moreover, the end of the 18th year is approaching, and the methods for preparing the final accounts urgently need to be determined so that various agencies can prepare them in a timely manner and complete them as soon as possible. Furthermore, since the budget regulations for the 17th year are feasible, it is proposed that the preparation of the final accounts for the 18th year be continued in accordance with the same format to avoid unnecessary changes. The Audit Yuan was contacted to solicit opinions, and a reply was received stating that the old regulations are still feasible. However, each agency should create an extra copy of the final account report when preparing it and send it to the Audit Yuan for preliminary review in order to avoid delays. Please handle accordingly.' Based on this, we have prepared a document and submitted it to your esteemed court for transfer to the National Government for review. If approved, we also request that you issue a circular instructing that the years stipulated in the old budget regulations for the 17th year be advanced by one year, and that no further regulations be issued to avoid complexity."

<p>— Holding to Buddhism</p>
<p>People's individualities vary infinitely. Forgive their shortcomings and cherish their strengths, and the world will be full of good people.</p>
<p>In life, there are favorable circumstances and unfavorable circumstances. It's like writing an essay: if there is only praise and no criticism, it cannot be a good essay. Therefore, being able to handle adversity has its own flavor.</p>
<p>Whenever starting something or establishing a career, one should first consider what the highest purpose is and what the consequences of failure would be. After carefully weighing the advantages and disadvantages, the undertaking will surely be accomplished and valuable.</p>
<p>From a young age, children should be taught the virtue of thrift and the difficulties of life; otherwise, they will surely experience great suffering and learn hard lessons. Even if they don't become dissolute, they will inevitably go through this process.</p>
<p>Being eccentric and disregarding customs is not the way to live in the world. There may be hidden dragons, but few who seek them out three times.</p>
<p>The way to nourish the mind, cure illness, live in the world, and conduct oneself lies in focusing on the word "qi." The effect is truly remarkable.</p>
<p>If one loves their parents as much as they love their wife, there will surely be no acts of disobedience. Thinking of where I came from, even if my parents unreasonably scold, humiliate, or beat me, I will gladly accept it.</p>
<p>Most men love women because they want to satisfy their sexual desires. That's why there are so many cases of starting with love and ending with abandonment. Even someone as talented and beautiful as Shuangwen is one of the ill-fated characters in history. Therefore, how should women carefully protect their lives?</p>
<p>When a wife is beautiful, her flaws will inevitably be discovered over time. When a wife is ugly, it seems that even in her ugliness there are beautiful aspects.</p>
<h3 id="e142">The Pioneer of the Revolutionary Army's Air Force <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qingduo</p>
<p>Since the National Revolutionary Army set out from Guangdong, they have repeatedly defeated strong rebels and recovered the southeastern provinces. In every battle, the air force played a role in reconnaissance and bombing. Recently, when the Revolutionary Army recovered Jinan, the air force first flew over and bombed the enemy. Their contribution was great. Many people know the effectiveness of airplanes, but few know who founded the air force. Who is this person? It is Li Qi'an, the current member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Central Party Department. Li has been engaged in revolution for thirty years. Before the Restoration, Li was still in America. At that time, the manufacture of airplanes was still in its infancy. Li realized that airplanes were an indispensable weapon in the Revolutionary Army, so he sent a letter from America to Sun Yat-sen, suggesting the organization of an air force for aerial combat. Sun Yat-sen replied approvingly. Li then gathered comrades in America, raised funds to purchase four airplanes, and brought them back to China to assist in military operations. After the Restoration, the Provisional Government was established in Nanjing, and Sun Yat-sen was elected as the Provisional President. Li was then appointed as the captain of the air force. This was the first time the Revolutionary Army organized an air force, and Li was the first captain of the air force. From then on, aviation talents gradually returned from overseas, and the air force gradually expanded. Now the National Government's Aviation Administration has organized seven air force teams. Li, with the passage of time and changing circumstances, stopped his aviation life many years ago. He has now changed his position to a member of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee. But Li's aviation qualifications have not diminished in the slightest.</p>

<p>Mei Lanfang's Aunt's Funeral: Mei Lanfang, who returned with honors from performing in America, had his aunt, Madam Hu, pass away on August 4th at her residence on Wuliangdaren Hutong in the East City of Beiping. Many famous actors and those who had friendships with Mei went to pay their respects. The funeral was very grand. On the 12th, the funeral procession was held. The crowds of spectators along the way were immense. The coffin was carried by sixty-four pallbearers, covered with an embroidered red cover, which was quite dignified and beautiful. The ceremonial guards included monks, Taoists, and Buddhist scriptures, three bands of music, a group of Qingyin music, four pairs of flower pots, four pairs of musical fairies (all exquisitely made of paper), hundreds of pairs of snow willows, more than five hundred wreaths, forty pieces of mourning couplets, and flower baskets, etc. Those who held the ropes for the coffin were all famous actors and Mei's relatives and friends, and there were quite a few people. It is said that Mei did not use large gongs and other traditional instruments, but adopted foreign funeral methods.</p>
<p>Police Bureau Disguise Competition: Wang Xifu, the director of the Beiping Police Bureau, recently ordered the chiefs, police, and detectives of the fifteen districts in the inner and outer cities to compete in disguises at the bureau's parade ground in order to investigate important cases due to the unstable local situation and the ease with which bandits cause trouble. There were as many as 360 people in disguise. The disguises included blind people, villagers on their way, female receptionists, male and female students, fashionable girls, peanut vendors, monks, lamas, Taoists, nuns, farmers, Boy Scouts, shoemakers, carpenters, tilers, bowl menders, erhu players, drummers, wind instrumentalists, porters, beggars, coal ball and waste paper pickers, knife sharpeners, barbers, egg sellers, vegetable and flower sellers, newspaper sellers, summer medicine sellers, rickshaw pullers, singers, fortune tellers, cooks, etc., not less than thirty kinds. They were bizarre and varied. There were thousands of visitors, and no one did not laugh. Director Wang also instructed the judges to give awards according to the quality of the performance in order to encourage them.</p>

<p>— Zhou Yuanqi</p>
<p>The autumn heat is oppressive, and I spend my days lying under the north window, reading paintings and reciting poems. Then I received a letter from Qian Huahuo, informing me that he was hosting the Art and Epigraphy Exhibition at the Yuncai Gallery on Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road. I braved the heat to visit my old friend at the exhibition, where we chatted and laughed happily. The four walls of the exhibition were almost entirely covered with paintings. Among them, Zeng Nongran's landscape painting in the style of Mi Fu was solid and yet had a rugged strength. This old gentleman is known throughout the country for his calligraphy, but his paintings are overshadowed by his calligraphy. In fact, this old gentleman's paintings are like Lin Qin'nan's literary works. Miao Pusun, known as Lishan Shanren, painted a chrysanthemum, with extremely exquisite and refined brushstrokes and balanced colors. He also inscribed it with the line: "No guests appreciate the flowing spring on the stone, only a few cold chrysanthemums understand its sound." I couldn't help but exclaim at this wonderful composition. Other works, such as Zhang Yuguang's tiger, Huang Binhong's landscape, and Liu Haisu's portrait, totaled more than thirty pieces, all of which were exquisite masterpieces. I heard Huahuo say that these thirty masterpieces will only be on display for three days. After that, Huahuo will hold a solo exhibition of Buddhist paintings, as well as an exhibition of calligraphy by Yang Du, who was famous during the Hongxian era. What is most noteworthy is that they are soliciting works from people in the old and new opera circles who are skilled in calligraphy and painting, such as Feng Zihe, Jin Biyan, Zheng Zhengqiu, Jia Biyun, Li Junpan, Wang Yunfang, Hu Hensheng, Huang Yulin, and Chen Jialin, each producing several pieces for an exhibition of calligraphy and painting by performers from the old and new opera circles. Among them, Jin Biyan's paintings of horses, Huang Yulin's clerical script, and Jia Biyun's landscapes are all rare works. I imagine it will cause a sensation. Huahuo also said that he has a large collection of cigarette lighters and cigarette pack labels, and he is planning to solicit others who specialize in collecting these unimportant items to hold a joint exhibition, refreshing the eyes and ears of the people of Shanghai. My friend Wang Zhongxian, who is known for his collection of painting fragments, is eager to try it out after hearing this news. It is said that Mr. Ge Gongzhen of this newspaper specializes in collecting newspapers from various countries. If they are combined for exhibition, it will also be a grand sight. Huahuo said that the name of this exhibition must have a unique flavor. He initially thought of the words "scrap paper basket," but Huahuo thought that "odds and ends" exhibition was better. This type of exhibition is not limited by any standard of what collections should be displayed. If one has old objects, such as fans, pouches, or snuff bottles, they can all be added. Huahuo spoke with great relish and offered Longjing's Biluochun tea, the fragrance permeating the spleen. Therefore, there is no need for Lu Tong's three paths. I had other important matters, so I couldn't listen to Huahuo's wonderful words any longer. I returned and wrote as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Record of a Dragon Appearing in Lake Ge <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Mei</p>
<p>Leaving Biling's west gate and heading south for thirty li, there is Lake Ge. It is a vast expanse of water, a hazy and misty sight. The scenery of this watery region has a unique charm. Lu Fan of the Ming dynasty wrote poems about Lake Ge, and Tang Qin composed lyrics about the autumn moon over the lake. The north and south sides are about a hundred li apart, and the east and west are thirty-five li. The lake is abundant with white fish and is bordered by Yixing in the middle. The mist is often so thick that mirages are visible. Legend has it that a family named Ge lived here and brought back a dragon egg, causing the land to sink and form the lake, hence the name. Recently returning to my hometown, I happened to meet my old friend Mr. Wang Huaisheng on the Shanghai-Nanjing road. While chatting over tea in the car, he told me about the dragon appearing on the lake, and after confirming its antiquity, it was truly astonishing. Having ample time as a copyist, I took up my pen to record it.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's home is by the shore of Lake Ge. A stream of misty water flows right outside his door. The green hills of Lake Ge's bank are faintly visible in the distance. Sails rise and fall, and birds compete to sing. The scenery is picturesque and worthy of appreciation. The winding boat songs in the morning and evening, and the unpitched fisherman's flute, often complement the sound of reading. He considers this to be the ultimate joy. One day, it was a long summer's day with sultry weather. The scorching sun was in the sky, and woodcutters and fishermen had temporarily stopped working. Some were taking naps like Zai Yu, while others rested under trees like Feng Yi. Even the cicadas singing in the treetops seemed to be affected by the heat, stopping their songs. At this time, everything was silent, almost like a dark night. The driving force of heaven and earth was only the swarms of dragonflies flying gracefully. Suddenly, a strong wind arose, and dark clouds gathered from all directions. A tail appeared in the sky, hanging down into the center of the lake. Clouds and mist surged, and the scales of a dragon shimmered. Lake water splashed in all directions, swirling upwards. Neighbors ran to tell each other, astonished and bewildered. At that time, two large boats were sailing past. One was driven by the wind into a small harbor, while the other had its mast broken and the hull overturned. A torrential rain suddenly arrived, as if pouring from a basin. After about a meal's time, it moved towards the opposite shore, rising slowly, and the rain stopped immediately. Suddenly, the sky felt clear and the air was fresh, and the summer heat dissipated. The willow branches on the lake were newly green, and the water was as smooth as a mirror. The scenery after the rain was even more beautiful. Several friends, wanting to explore the extraordinary event, eagerly rowed a small boat to track it across the lake. They saw that where the dragon's body had passed, it stretched for three or four li, with houses collapsing and crops flattened. The width was about ten feet, like a roadway. Its end point was the Dragon King Temple. Mr. Wang originally did not believe that dragons existed in this world, but having witnessed this scene, what could he doubt?</p>
<p>Xiumei said, "The dragon is the leader of scaled creatures, one of the four spiritual beings. In ancient times, there were even officials in charge of raising dragons. The records in the classics are numerous and verifiable. Even today, geological studies examining fossils in the ground have confirmed that they were the largest animals of ancient times. However, they have long disappeared from the world. As for the distant sightings of dark, wriggling shadows near the sea, commonly called 'hanging dragons,' they are actually a type of hurricane that carries water upwards. However, Mr. Wang is a sincere scholar, and the event was witnessed firsthand, so his words should not be false. Could it be that the legend of the Ge family's dragon egg is not without reason? This is truly extraordinary."</p>

<h3 id="e146">The Origin of the French Concession in Shanghai (Part 2) <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Ji Ping from the "North-China Herald"</p>
<p>In addition, the only astronomical observatory in China was built. The predictions published by this observatory were highly trusted by merchants navigating the Chinese coast. Before the French Concession became a ceded territory, there were many debates. In the past, there was a guild hall for the Chinese within the concession, as well as a place to keep coffins, namely the "Bingshe." There was also a public cemetery for burying those who could not afford burial grounds. In 1863, the guild hall and cemetery were located within the boundaries crossed by the French Concession. In 1865, there were plans to add roads. In 1870, a map of the proposed roads was published. The French Municipal Council decided to build certain roads, but the Siming Public Hall pointed out that if the roads were built according to the proposed map, their approved cemetery would be divided. The two sides argued endlessly, resulting in a riot. Chinese people set fire to many foreign residences. Although no foreigners were killed, there was a constant sense of danger. Several people were seriously injured. Seven Chinese people died and twelve were injured. As a result, the French consul allowed the Siming Public Hall and cemetery to remain untouched to settle the matter. However, this was overturned in 1898. The originally planned roads had already been built.</p>
<p>After this incident, the French built various roads according to their wishes within their concession and worked hard to manage it, turning the concession into the best residential area. Many British and Americans chose to build houses there, ignoring their own national concession. Furthermore, there were not many French people moving into the concession. In recent years, the French Concession has progressed rapidly. Many new roads and modern buildings have been built. Avenue Joffre is the most French-style avenue. The area nearby, such as Rue Cardinal Mercier, Avenue Albert, and Route Pichon, has gradually become the center of the French Concession. Not only are French businesses concentrated here, but international businesses are also conducted here. Many members of the French Cercle Sportif Français are British. The towering building called Cathay Mansions houses people from various countries. In addition to this, there are currently two large theaters under construction, one being the Lyceum Theatre opposite the French Club, and the other being the Carlton Theatre on Avenue Joffre. The French Cercle Sportif Français is the largest social center in Shanghai, due to its large tennis courts, swimming pool, and balconies. It has members from various countries. Dog and horse racing are nearby. In addition to the French Cercle Sportif Français, there are two clubs, one being the French Club and the other being the Police Club. The French Concession has its own tram, electricity, and water plants, and is not affiliated with the International Settlement. The French water and electricity plants have contributed greatly to the prosperity of the French Concession. There are many schools in the French Concession, making significant contributions to education and culture. Many have received high praise. St. Joseph's School is directly supervised by St. Joseph's Church. Aurora University is strictly managed and has cultivated many talented individuals. The Municipal Council operates two schools, one being the French School on Rue du Koukling and the other being the Franco-Chinese School on Baikal Road. In addition, there are St. Francis Xavier's School, Xuhui College, and schools run by the Catholic Church. Statistics published by the French Chamber of Commerce in China show the rise and prosperity of French society. There are a total of 6,704 French residents in China, with one-fifth of them residing in Shanghai. There are a total of 246 French businesses in China, with 125 in Shanghai, which is not a small number.</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Visiting the Palace of Versailles (Part 4)</p>
<p>For the panoramic view of the Palace of Versailles and its gardens, it is best to stand on the highest level of the main palace and look down. You can see the large white stone platform in front of the main palace, resembling the one in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony in Beijing. In the front part, there are two large fountains surrounded by many bronze statues of male, female, old, and young water gods. The water sprays fiercely like clouds and mist. Various exotic flowers and trees are planted on the left and right, forming different shapes. Descending ten steps leads to the ground level. In the center is the Latona Fountain, Bassinde Latone. In the middle, there is a nude female statue, which is the statue of the goddess Latona. Latona is the mother of the god Apollo. —I should mention that the Latona Fountain is very grand. The circular stone platform in the middle has five layers. On top of each layer stands a stone-carved angel and a bronze-cast monster, all spouting water in different directions like mist and waves from their mouths. Dozens of water sprays erupt simultaneously. Anyone would marvel at this spectacle. Countless stone statues surround it. Flowers and stone steps encircle it from above and below. Trees surround the flowers, and the trees are tall and trimmed flat, stretching for more than ten li, dense and uniform. In front of the Latona Fountain is the green lawn stretching for ten li, with white stones lining the path. Every ten steps there are rows of stone statues. At the end of the green lawn is the Apollo Fountain, Bassin d'Apollon, filled with clear water, reflecting the azure sky. In the center, the god Apollo drives four galloping horses. This is a famous French sculpture. The characteristic of this sculpture is that it expresses the instantaneous movement of the god Apollo. His body leans forward, and his head faces upwards, as if gazing at the light of the sun. His right hand tightly grips the reins, and his left hand faces backwards, forming a direct opposition to his right hand. Therefore, the rapid movement of the body is fully expressed. The four horses, under the rapid control of the god Apollo, run wildly on the water in a violent rage. This posture expresses an instant of movement, achieving a full effect. During the height of the reign of Louis XIV, more than fifty sculptors gathered in the Palace of Versailles, specializing in the production of decorations for the palace and gardens. Therefore, wherever we go in Versailles today, we always see very beautiful and grand sculptures. I believe that no royal palace in Europe or America can compare to it. Even the Forbidden City in Beijing, China, although grand and solemn, does not have the sculptures that fill the Palace of Versailles and its gardens. The Apollo Fountain faces the palace a hundred feet away. Further ahead, there is a long stream stretching for several li. Trees line both sides, reaching the sky. Large roads are opened within them, and cars can drive around. The garden covers thousands of acres and is divided into four seasons. There are eighty fountains. Looking back from the end of the long stream, the green sky stretches as far as the eye can see, and the hills are endless. The magnificent and open scenery is truly astonishing.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Last Week's Drastic Changes in the Gold Market <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Fierce and Terrifying</p>
<p>Falling Despite Weakness</p>
<p>Fluctuations Reached 36.2 Taels</p>
<p>The fluctuations in the Shanghai gold market last week were dramatic, chaotic, and unpredictable. The situation was extremely complex and unstoppable. Daily fluctuations ranged from 10 to over 20 taels, with rapid rises and falls. Dealers seemed lost, unable to make sense of the situation. The downward trend that started at the beginning of the week intensified rapidly, breaking through the 530 tael mark, almost in freefall. By Thursday, it had dropped to 529 taels, mainly because even though "Da Tiao" (silver bars for delivery) shrank, silver prices rose. Additionally, large sellers dumped their holdings, triggering the decline. Towards the weekend, foreign speculators like George Joege made large purchases to cover short positions and reversed to long positions. As a result, the exchange rate trend became tight, and the silver market was expected to shrink. Market sentiment was particularly positive, and it quickly rebounded, exceeding the 560 tael mark. The market appeared optimistic. However, short sellers had to cover their positions at a loss, causing significant impact and widespread concern. The difference between the highest and lowest prices during the week was 36.2 taels. Da Tiao rose by a total of half a cent, and the exchange rate rose by 1.5 points, to 1 shilling and 375 pence. As for the various dealers, many still had outstanding September contracts that had not been settled. In recent days, they have been gradually settling them, but the buyers have arbitrarily raised prices, reaching more than 10 to 20 taels. Otherwise, they would have to pay in cash at maturity. Given the shortage of spot gold in the market, those who were short faced immense pressure. The spot price was more than 20 taels higher than the market price, which was considered exorbitant. The dramatic changes in the market were impossible to predict. Here is a summary of the events that took place from Monday, August 18th to Saturday, August 23rd:</p>
<p>Result: Still Down 2.1 Taels</p>
<p>Starting from Monday, August 18th, Da Tiao silver had slightly recovered, and the exchange rate trend was weakening. In the gold market, October was strong in the morning but weak later. The afternoon market fell sharply by more than 20 taels due to Hengxingshengda and others selling, as well as news of cash export restrictions in Japan. The closing price was 43-44 taels. The next day, the silver market continued to rise, and the exchange rate rose sharply by 2 points. Therefore, the Shanghai gold market fell in early trading, breaking the 40 tael mark. Later, buying activity increased, and the London exchange rate turned from weak to stable, rebounding by 10 taels, reaching 47-48 taels. On Wednesday, the market situation was chaotic and turbulent, uncontrollable. However, because Da Tiao remained unchanged in the morning, and the silver market shrank, sentiment softened. It fell in early trading and dropped more than 10 taels from morning to noon. After 10 o'clock, it once fell to just over 50 taels. In the afternoon, rumors of the Central Bank selling spot gold caused panic among the long positions, and it suddenly dropped to 32-33 taels. The afternoon market seemed to ease, rebounding by 4-5 taels, but without significant changes, only fluctuating by 7-8 taels. The total fluctuation for the day was 20 taels. The next day, Da Tiao contracted, but the exchange rate eased, and the gold market rebounded by 10 taels. The morning market once broke into 530 taels, reaching 29 taels. Later, Hengxingshengda, Xinxing, and others bought in, recovering by 10 taels, resulting in a range of 37 taels, slightly down 7 cents from the previous day. On Friday, Da Tiao rose again, and the exchange rate improved. Therefore, the Shanghai gold market showed signs of rising. However, the fluctuation was only about 9 taels, hovering around 40 taels. Dealers such as Yuanxing and Yongyuansheng covered their short positions, and it jumped from 39 taels to 47-48 taels. On Saturday, the market situation continued to improve, with large buyers covering short positions and foreign firms also reversing to long positions. Sentiment strengthened, showing signs of soaring. It quickly broke through the 60 tael mark. The difference within half a day was 14-15 taels. However, Da Tiao weakened, and the London exchange rate contracted by half a point, and the domestic market was also tight. At noon, it reached 62 taels, and the closing price was 61 taels and 7 cents. Later, it rose by another 1-2 taels. Short sellers were eager to cover their positions, but they were under immense pressure, suffering heavy losses. It soared by 14 taels and 1 cent compared to the previous day, and a total of 25 taels compared to last Monday (Saturday). However, it was still down 2.1 taels compared to last Saturday. The initial discount for spot gold against the Shanghai gold market price was over 80 taels, but it gradually decreased to around 50 taels by the weekend. The prices of silver markets, exchange rates, Shanghai gold market etc. in England, America and India are listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market showed considerable unease at the beginning of the week, mainly because the overseas raw cotton market experienced a consistently sharp decline. Buyers were wary due to the unfavorable environment and anticipated a persistent downward trend in yarn prices. Consequently, they hesitated to make purchases, leading to a quiet sales environment. However, the Tianjin Gaoyang merchant group absorbed a large batch of 20-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn futures, approximately 5,000 bales, purely for speculative purposes. Yet, actual sales remained stagnant, resulting in a calm market sentiment. Buyers, observing the overall market trend, adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Nevertheless, the Chaozhou merchant group reversed positions by selling over 10,000 bales within these few days. Subsequently, by Wednesday and Thursday, American cotton prices stabilized somewhat, and the downward trend subsided. Due to reduced production, the market for third-grade yarn was relatively stable. A certain manufacturer and the Guangdong merchant group released near-month contracts and purchased far-month contracts, causing a slight increase in market prices. Simultaneously, outward sales became more active. Currently, the yarn market is higher than the cotton market; however, sellers also have strong influence, with both buyers and sellers possessing considerable strength. The future direction depends on actual demand. It is noted that total purchases by various merchant groups for the entire week amounted to 15,225 bales, including 6,000 to 7,000 bales of futures by Tianjin, inland areas, and Shantou, and 3,970 bales by fellow traders. The weekend saw a rise of one or two taels in Japanese yarn prices. Marked yarn initially followed the decline in foreign cotton, but then rebounded due to strong buying pressure. The lowest price for October contracts reached 154 taels and three mace. Consequently, prices for all months were down seven or eight mace compared to the previous week. Total transaction volume for the week was 120,050 bales. The prices paid by various merchant groups are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Merchant Group Number of Bales Merchant Group Number of Bales Merchant Group Number of Bales</p>
<p>Sichuan 2825 Guangdong 900 Shantou 345 Nanyang 190 Fellow Traders 3970 Qingdao 390 Luzhou 215 Xuzhou 175 Hankou 105</p>

<h3 id="e155">Last Week, the Cotton Market Was Depressed by American Cotton <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>American cotton experienced a sharp decline, reaching the lowest price in several years, with spot prices reaching 11 cents. This situation was entirely due to the smooth progress of the new cotton harvest and a sharp reduction in consumption. Disappointed buyers triggered a significant drop. Although local cotton had the support of the Ningbo merchant group and strong buying pressure, the overall trend was difficult to resist. Small investors became fearful and had to cut their losses, resulting in a very weak market situation. This month, buying companies were unable to provide support, and most had to watch prices fall to 31 taels. Selling pressure intensified, and the buying side attempted to transfer 35,000 piculs to a certain manufacturer at a price of 32.5 taels, while simultaneously purchasing futures within a price limit of 3 taels. As a result, the market was temporarily supported, and the short-term panic subsided. Far-month contracts also fluctuated, with the lowest price for October reaching 32 taels and 2.5 mace. Market sentiment strengthened slightly at the weekend. However, a certain manufacturer continued to sell heavily to close out positions within a price limit of 3 taels. With favorable weather for the new cotton crop and abundant harvests in various regions, manufacturers rarely sold new cotton due to sufficient inventories of old cotton. The future of the cotton market depends on the weather and the price of American cotton. Prices for marked cotton across all months fell by eight to nine mace to one tael compared to the previous week. Total transaction volume for the week was 470,500 piculs. It is noted that the total transaction volume in the Hankou marked cotton futures market was 430,000 piculs, with both buyers and sellers remaining firm. Significant changes are expected to occur in the future. American cotton prices fell another 35 points this week. Manufacturers imported 22,800 piculs of Indian cotton, 1,960 piculs of local cotton, and trading houses imported 1,560 piculs. The volume of purchases by various manufacturers and trading houses is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e156">Grains: The Heshia Rice Market is Consistently Declining <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, over ten merchants from various regions arrived in Zhabei, but sales were extremely sluggish. High-quality and fresh Bei merchants' polished rice were down slightly by nearly one jiao. The opening price for large quantities was 20 yuan and seven or eight jiao. Medium and lower-grade polished rice were down by another one or two jiao. The market situation showed consistent weakness. Currently, stocks from the countryside will gradually be transported to Shanghai for sale, and local stockpilers also intend to sell. Therefore, the prospects for polished rice will only improve with a significant change in circumstances; otherwise, prices will continue to decline. The downward trend for thin rice has stabilized. Arrivals seem dry, and demand is acceptable, so prices have softened slightly by five fen to one jiao. Top-quality rice opened at 20 yuan and nine jiao. Since the previous night, Dongxin polished rice has fallen to 18.5 yuan, and the market has temporarily stabilized. However, the supply of this variety is abundant, making it difficult to maintain the current price level. Demand for new Kejian rice is sluggish, and arrivals are continuous, so prices are hovering around 14 yuan. The Bianyuan market continues to be weak, mainly due to slow sales, so prices have fallen by another jiao, with high-quality rice opening at 18 yuan and seven or eight jiao.</p>
<p>Hunan: Very few boats arrived from Heshia. The Changshu and Xixi machine-milled polished rice market is quiet. Stocks and arrivals of both are low, so buyers are not paying attention. Su-Tong machine-milled polished rice has a slight market presence, and the market is generally weak. Ordinary high-quality rice opened at around 19 yuan, with very few transactions. The Nan merchant group's thin early rice market is clear, with no significant price fluctuations, around 20 yuan and six jiao. Sales of scattered Baiyuan are slightly active, with a weak situation. High-quality rice barely opened at 18 yuan and two or three jiao. Overall, the rice market here was quiet with few transactions, unlike the active market in the north.</p>

<p>Coarse Granulated White Sugar Turns from Weak to Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no sugar market dispatches from producing areas, due to it being Sunday. The guild market allocated inventory. Dealers considered that the large scale of sugar reduction has shrunk even more, and the Monday foreign exchange market expected to increase even more, so the market rose from weak to strong, and households tightened stocks. The transaction price was 7 taels 8 qian 7.5 fen. Slightly better goods went for 7 taels 9 qian. Though transactions were few, the market was firm. Fine granulated white sugar went for 8 taels. The market wasn’t weak either. Japanese sugar NX mark went from 7 taels 8 qian 5 fen to 7 taels 8 qian 7.5 fen, which is up from the last price by 2.5 fen. The market was also pretty firm. Minghua YP mark went for 7 taels 9 qian 5 fen, YT mark went for 7 taels 7 qian 5 fen, J mark went for 8 taels and 5 fen. All these also switched to firm. Number plates had Zhenxiang Hao put out more than 100 bags of refined white sugar, priced at 7 taels and 9 qian and 5 fen, a drop of 5 fen compared with the last number plates, and the market showed signs of decline.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Silk and Tea: Last Week, the Silk Market Trended Poorly <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>World Economy Declining… Sales of Silk Fabrics Sluggish</p>
<p>Overseas Silk Dispatches Not Transmitted… Prices Minor, Yet Nobody Inquires</p>
<p>Last week, both local and foreign silk markets in this port trended ever worse. The world's economies are showing signs of decline, sales of silk fabrics are still trending sluggish, not a few silk mills on both sides of the Pacific Ocean are shutting down or halting production, unemployed workers are rising daily, and consumption of raw silk is sharply declining. All overseas silk dispatches are not transmitted, silk prices are especially low, yet nobody inquires. The coldness of the European and American raw silk market has been unseen since the European war. Yokohama Japanese silk prices last week sharply fell to more than 700 Japanese yen. Shanghai mills, mills-agents, etc. are still just doing spot transactions, the futures market is quiet, and silk prices have the trend of sharply falling too. The transport of Japanese dry cocoons to Shanghai for sales has gotten very active. Though model cocoons have been transported, the Japanese silk traders, because they can see the mill silk's external sales don't move, the cocoon prices tread poorly. Japanese cocoons will halt transport to Shanghai. The Shanghai Silk Mill Trade Association and the Silk Cocoon General Office have both started to gather the silk and cocoon merchants to discuss means of resisting, in order to avoid encroaching sales of Chinese cocoons, and disrupting the market. Then, transport of Japanese cocoons to China is feared to not come to pass. Last week, spot silk transactions were 300 bags, exported were more than 800 bags, and overseas medium-lower body mills agents' raw silk prices are about to enter the 1000 tael territory. New York and Lyon Chinese silk prices are ever worse. I shall list at the end the Chinese silk market prices of the European and American market at the end of last week (New York every pound price, unit gold dollar; Lyon every kilogram price, unit French francs):</p>

<h3 id="e165">By the Fort of Taiwan <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Juan</p>
<p>A tall, red Western-style house stands proudly amidst the boundless green fields. This is the campus of a certain university by the fort of Taiwan. Because I admired the seaside scenery and, incidentally, wanted to escape the summer heat, I resolutely moved here to spend my summer vacation. I initially thought that since the term was over, the air here would be quieter, but it turned out to be otherwise. Not only did many students from distant places not go home, but new students also arrived for the summer school. As a result, this Latin Quarter of Wusong became very lively.</p>
<p>Along the only stone path at the school gate, there are twenty to thirty low-rise bungalows, and a few are even covered with thatch, reminding one of the line, "Earthen walls and thatched roofs, a horse cherry tree in front of the door." Although there are no horse cherry trees here, there are a few weeping willows swaying in front of the eaves and fences, nestled between the red walls and green fields. While one cannot say that it is particularly beautiful, the signs of human habitation have almost completely disappeared.</p>
<p>The sole patrons of these bungalows and thatched cottages are the students of various schools, but nine out of ten are from China Public School. Other schools, such as the Merchant Marine Academy, are just there to make up the numbers. More than ten restaurants face each other, and they place their incredibly large dining tables on the road. The distance between one and the other is only three feet. Fortunately, there are no vehicles, and even if a few rickshaws arrive, they can still squeeze through. The owners of these restaurants are all from Henan, and they use clumsy stoves to make extremely unappetizing food and dishes, selling them to their patrons at very low prices. However, these patrons devour the food with gusto, as if they cannot get enough of the rich delicacies. Life as a student is truly made of gold. Even the digestive power of their stomachs surpasses everything else. I think that they are not only able to eat, but also able to make the most of their environment. In this humid coastal area, wearing leather shoes is both uncomfortable and prone to foot problems. So, they take off their leather shoes and simply do not wear socks, instead wearing a pair of clogs all day long. Even when they are at home, they only add a pair of shorts. I cannot describe their skin tone. In short, if an Indian were to pass by, he would definitely recognize them as fellow countrymen. When I first arrived here, I only heard the "da-la…da-la…" sound of clogs, and I almost suspected that I was in the Japanese countryside. But that was not the case. Their shoes were not Japanese clogs, but Cantonese wooden slippers. The style is very simple, and the price is cheap. They only sell for two dimes a pair in the small grocery stores in the Latin Quarter, and I doubt you can find such a high price anywhere else. It is said that this trend was initially promoted by Cantonese students, and gradually spread to students from other provinces. Now, all the students are following suit, except for a few female students. During the summer vacation, the students are not very studious. Their favorite activity is swimming. Anyway, the Huangpu River is not far away, and further away, one can go to the Three Gorges waters. They determine the distance of the location based on their swimming ability. Every day at sunset, when the bright moon has not yet emerged from the sea, one often sees teams of Cantonese or Sichuanese students walking down the dike to bathe. They usually do not swim very far. Only once did I see a Cantonese man swim from near the "flag house" to the lighthouse, about a mile away. Because the waters at the mouth of the Three Gorges are extremely turbulent, with the confluence of the Yangtze River and the Huangpu River, as well as the impact of the tides, people often drown. The last time a Merchant Marine Academy student, Xiang Yuzhi, died, it was in this area. So, people are wary and dare not easily go to "Shitang" anymore.</p>
<p>The seaside scenery is so beautiful. The morning glow dyes the seawater into various different, indescribable paintings. The weather in late summer and early autumn is just right, with a touch of coolness. Strolling along the embankment, one feels the wind in one's sleeves, bathed in such a solution of nature. Although it is not heaven, it is not something that exists in the human world either. In the evening, the powerful rays of the setting sun cast a myriad of colors across the sky. It kisses the seawater, making its cheeks flush red. At this time, male students with the "da-la" sound of clogs, carrying the graceful figures of female students, come to the seaside together for a walk. The sound of clogs and the "ge-ge" sound of high heels, combined with the crashing sound of the waves against the shore, create a wonderful symphony. This music should only exist on the sea, and cannot be heard elsewhere. In order to appreciate more of the beautiful scenery, they sit side by side on the seawall, talking about the past and the present, and all sorts of things that should be said between young people. However, the number of female students is less than 10% of the number of male students. So, many male students probably do not have girlfriends. I often say, "This is the land of men, and women are just ornaments." However, even so, their academic atmosphere is very good. Even if one person sits outside until late at night, there will be no unexpected incidents. Thinking back to the bitterness of not being able to sit freely in the French Park, I truly feel that this place and Shanghai are not in the same world. And, I do not hear any erhu tunes or the sounds of Beijing opera. Even in their dormitories outside the school, there is only some flute music. Unlike the apartment life in various universities in Beijing, where mahjong and Beijing opera are their only subjects, that kind of corrupt situation makes one feel unpleasant just thinking about it. However, the students here are not natives, but are gathered from all directions. But they are all very well-behaved and very serious. So, I think that the so-called power of the group is truly unbelievable.</p>
<p>I also lazily stay in such an environment, reading a few more good books.</p>

<h3 id="e167">A New Atmosphere at Great China University <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Great China University, with its short history and rapid development, is truly progressing by leaps and bounds. This is not an intentional compliment, but a genuine fact. Six years ago, over a hundred students and several teachers left Xiamen University and came to Shanghai. In such difficult circumstances, as President Wang of the university said, at the beginning, they rented houses and lived in narrow, simple dwellings that barely sheltered them from wind and rain. They borrowed money to eat, enduring hardship and struggling to make ends meet. Virtually nothing was available in terms of material necessities. At that time, could the people running the school, or anyone else, have imagined the Great China University of today? It is truly astonishing. In previous years, the student body was only two to three hundred, but the rate of increase has been very rapid. By last autumn, the number of students in all departments reached over 1,300. This year, about 200 students were admitted in the first round of admissions. Recently, in the second examination, over 500 students were admitted. What's most interesting is that on the day of this examination, men and women on Jiaozhou Road were bustling and crowded, and the large auditorium was filled with enthusiastic scenes. This goes without saying. From this, we can see the speed at which the number of students is increasing. It is also reported that the school will hold a third examination on September 5th. It is estimated that by the time school starts, the university will have 1,800 new and old students. This is not only a new era for Great China University, but also likely unprecedented among universities in Shanghai. In terms of school buildings, new buildings have been erected at Fanwangdu. There are eight towering Western-style buildings, with Qunxian Hall as the main auditorium, Qunce Hall as the first male dormitory, Qunli Hall as the second male dormitory, and Qunying Hall as the female dormitory. There is also a temporary office, a temporary chemical laboratory, faculty housing, a temporary auditorium, three large dining halls, a Western-style dining room, a coffee shop, etc., all exquisitely magnificent. In addition, there are more than ten bungalows, called "City Houses," for small-scale retail. This marks a new phase in the construction aspect of Great China University. In terms of equipment, a self-drilled artesian well and a water tower have been built in the west corner of the school. Reflectors have been installed in the classrooms, and automatic electric bells are installed on each floor. An electric clock is installed at the highest point of Qunxian Hall to avoid the inconvenience of shaking bells to signal class changes. All other utensils are mostly exquisite Chinese and Western items. Efforts are also being made to enrich the library and equipment. In addition, there is an old pool next to the university dormitory, which is currently being renovated and planned to be built as a swimming pool for male and female students to exercise during their spare time. In terms of classes, in addition to literature, science, commerce, law, teacher training, and preparatory courses, a kindergarten normal school has been added to create kindergarten teachers. There are also plans to open a kindergarten and primary school to promote elementary education and become a complete university. These plans are expected to be realized this semester. It is also heard that President Ou and others are planning to organize Great China New Village near the school buildings to design a new society. All of these are prominent aspects of the new atmosphere at Great China University. As for minor details, such as the fact that the Great China University girls of the past, not intentionally slandering them, did indeed have the flavor of sheltered young ladies, while the newly arrived girls are mostly generous and poised in social interactions, I don't need to list them all. In short, the Great China University of today is not the Great China University of the past, and the future progress of Great China University is still limitless. (Ze Xiang)</p>

<p>— A One-Act Drama of Legend —</p>
<p>By Xiang Peiliang</p>
<p>"While it is true that some of the folk ideas in our Chinese society are poisoned by feudal thought, there are also those folk tales, legends, and ballads that aim for the survival, freedom, and prosperity of the nation, and a part of these certainly exist." In fact, many of those stories, legends, and ballads contain seeds of "national consciousness," and their content can very well represent the national character and national spirit of that era. If we say that this is a treasure trove of our literary expressions, it is by no means an exaggeration. However, very few Chinese literary writers have noticed these, and they are unwilling to explore these treasures.</p>
<p>China itself has always been a great enigma. Foreign scholars have even written books like "The Enigma of China," which shows that Chinese folk literature is extraordinarily rich. Unfortunately, most of it has been lost, except for the relatively memorable ones, and some have even been turned from gold into iron by ordinary bored people, losing their original form, and a true evaluation has never been given. Even after the New Literary Movement blossomed in China, there are still very few works that take folk stories, legends, and ballads as their subject matter. In terms of drama, it goes without saying. In principle, we cannot deny or despise these at all, but should collect them as much as possible and evaluate them, put the good ones into the art machine to give all the people a chance to appreciate them, and denounce and eliminate the bad ones as much as possible, so as to avoid repeating mistakes. Therefore, we should clearly recognize that the power of folk literature is endowed with the authority to penetrate the masses. Therefore, if we want our literature to truly expand to the masses and get their appreciation and response, we must absolutely not ignore the value of all folk literature.</p>
<p>This is very obvious. The first misuse of folk literature is in the old dramas with incomprehensible and lingering tastes, isn't it? The Weaver Girl and the Cowherd, The Legend of the White Snake, which of these dramas does not damage the original value by the general riffraff, and at the same time mislead so many people? But in the past, our writers were indifferent to this situation. After all, they still could not escape the ego-centered position. However, creating an exception, we found Xiang Peiliang's one-act drama "White Snake and Xu Xian" of folk legends on our literary scene, which is really worth praising. The story of White Snake and Xu Xian is very well known among the people. Every time during the Dragon Boat Festival, the actors who always appear on stage say that they are staging a show, but what is the content? It is difficult to say. Where is the true "White Snake and Xu Xian" original face being performed? Anyone who knows a little about drama will sigh in unison, right? Then Xiang Peiliang's work in this area is very meaningful. First, it opened up the precedent of expressing folk legends and reflecting them in drama. Second, it also gave a profound analysis of White Snake and Xu Xian, and evaluated their due value and position in "folk literature."</p>
<p>Regarding the legend of "White Snake and Xu Xian," although many people talk about it with relish, they have not finally recognized their great "love." Most of the views are like the guest in the play, "I think when Lady White was in the deep mountains before, how carefree and comfortable she was. She came to the world for no reason and almost lost her life several times. Now she doesn't know what the result will be. This is really self-inflicted trouble." And who can understand and sympathize like the daughter in the play, "I like Lady White, I love her love as deep as the sea, I love her courage as big as the sky, she just cares about love, she doesn't care about anything else, I also want to learn her boldness." "Love" is originally an interesting thing, but unfortunately most people misunderstand it, waste it in vain, and even destroy it. In the past, who had ever said such words for Bai Suzhen, "Emotions are such strange things, we used to have lively days too. I just need to use my magical powers to call stones to be our guests, and I can call the little birds in the mountains to turn into beautiful girls--these phantom-like things can also make us happy for a while, but I suddenly feel ridiculous, even terrifying, just like seeing too many activities of my own shadow, that kind of entertainment without heartfelt communication will not satisfy me, when their hands hold my hands, there is no warm feeling to excite my blood flow, on the day of the lake tour, I wanted to completely live in the world as a human being, I want to become a complete person to taste human emotions, I want to enjoy all the joys of the world, and also endure all the pains of the world, and at that time, we saw him, a innocent and glorious young man, so I decided to live my life with him." I think, about the passion of White Snake and Xu Xian, "Yes, you have already lost it, I exchanged it with my life, not just once, you are what I exchanged with my life several times," I am afraid that very few people have paid attention to it. Perhaps they will say as unreasonably as Fahai, "Why be obsessed with a demon, all that is fake--beauty, kindness, charm, are all on stage, all like lightning, there is great poison behind it, our life is like swimming, women are heavy objects that hinder you, make you fall into salt, and cannot reach the other shore safely, let alone a demon," really "don't know what our feelings are like." Therefore, I express my great respect for Xiang Peiliang's grasp of this great conclusion. In fact, only this is the true face of White Snake and Xu Xian that needs to be expressed.</p>
<p>Here, the author uses mature techniques, tight structure, and supporting foil to depict White Snake and Xu Xian. The characters used are very appropriate, and the content has not deviated from what is said in folk legends. I dare say that the author's "White Snake and Xu Xian" not only overthrows the old drama The Legend of the White Snake, but also opens up a different kind of color for our drama movement. Moreover, in the sense of drama education, it is also very profound, enough to stir people's "creative desire" and "upward will" to develop the great power of life. If this is used to replace and instill it into the people, the effect will be as expected.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Wilderness Poetry Special Issue <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Shiyan</p>
<p>The vigorous wilderness makes us readers more supportive and friendly. The efforts of the wilderness also make us work hard invisibly. Nationalism flies in our minds, national consciousness is fixed in our reason, and the needs of the nation are revealed before our eyes. We have clearly recognized it. We have long admired the articles of the wilderness. Its papers, creations, essays, poems, etc. are all beautiful in writing and bold in literary style, and especially Suizhuan and poems are the most. This time, the fifth issue of the third volume is a special issue of poetry, how happy and appreciative we are.</p>
<p>In the special issue of poetry, we discovered a new author. His poems directly make our hair stand on end, and they are short and only have four sections. Let's look at his work.</p>
<p>Go forward Zhang Xiamei</p>
<p>The bells of the times spur us not to hesitate, the decline of the nation does not allow us to be decadent again, prepare our blue blood and heads to fight for the nation, what is the glory of fighting to the death compared to a pile of yellow earth,</p>
<p>The sad horns keep wailing to urge us to mount our horses, the thousands of strands of soft silk are thrown away where the gun blades are exposed, oh, I only allow you a passionate kiss on the horse, wave your whip and go, I swear to stain the yellow sand with blood,</p>
<p>Cries do not hear the enemy's guns have attacked us, look at the martyrs' blood has flowed before us, hold up our sharp weapons and aim at the enemy, prepare our white bones to build the glory of our nation,</p>
<p>Go ahead friends, this is our time, don't shrink back, and don't pretend to hesitate, I'm holding a long gun, and you have to hold a short knife, if the enemy doesn't retreat, I swear to stain the yellow sand with blood,</p>
<p>Similarly, after reading this poem "Go Forward," there is another small poem by Bai Na to comfort the soldiers, "Dedicated to the Soldiers" is to encourage the soldiers to cheer up and go to the front for the nation, and to comfort the soldiers for sacrificing everything for the nation.</p>
<p>Soldiers,</p>
<p>Dedicate this lamp,</p>
<p>For you to attack the rebels,</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Soldiers,</p>
<p>Sing generously,</p>
<p>And drink this cup and another cup,</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Soldiers,</p>
<p>The bugle is playing,</p>
<p>Have you ever cheered up and shaken off your spirits,</p>
<p>After reading two generous and passionate encouragements and encouragements for the nation to go to the battlefield, our blood has already boiled, and our enthusiasm cannot be stopped. We feel that there is nothing in the world that is truly worth cherishing. We only cherish our nation, China, have 400 million compatriots felt the pain of the nation? I hope that this wilderness is universal in the world, and it will arouse the nationalistic center of the compatriots unconsciously, and cheer up the people's spirit. With the unity of the people, our nation is not afraid of the national flag everywhere, and all directions vibrate.</p>
<p>Tang Zengyang's "Ode to Youth in the Age" is different in style and meaning from the above two, and the warning is implicit in the joy. Now, copying down two sections can also see the different tones of the style and the neatness of the words.</p>
<p>The times sing of youth,</p>
<p>Birds chirp light songs,</p>
<p>Flowers and plants show a warm smile,</p>
<p>This is a holy land of happiness,</p>
<p>The times sing of youth,</p>
<p>The steeds gallop on the parade ground,</p>
<p>Millions of people sing before the distant mountains,</p>
<p>This is a holy land of happiness,</p>
<p>We have seen passionate heroic songs, we have seen brave words to encourage soldiers, we have seen beautiful and desolate recent works by Zengyang, and now we have seen another kind of ironic and cold "Urban Loose Strings" Fourth Target Field, Mi Luo is also an author we have long known, his works do not need our introduction. Now copy three sections below, and the readers can appreciate it themselves.</p>
<p>Such a desolate and deserted place with weeds and smoke, pitifully letting people fan their weapons and shoot targets, a grim aura of killing is lurking around the spikes and steel, obviously drawing a majestic and solemn divide,</p>
<p>This is a picture poem, the scenery of the target field suddenly leaps before our eyes, the weather, scenery, climate, and human feelings are truly revealed. Such a good place is indeed a scenic spot for us to embrace each other. It is a pity that you lovers who are holding hands and stepping into the park, have you ever heard the sound of "slap slap slap" of gunfire, and has infinite passion surged in your hearts, thinking of the land of your motherland, which has been occupied by foreign countries, and we are still going to appreciate it.</p>
<p>The rest include Wang Tiehua's "Whip Up Your Horse and Go Forward" and "The Chirp of the Stream," Huang Yuro's "Night Tour" "Not Allowed" Zengyang's "Praise Song," due to space limitations.</p>
<h3 id="e170">A Bird's-Eye View of New Works by European Writers (10) Last Chapter <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Manru</p>
<p>Novel by Norwegian Hamsun</p>
<p>Hamsun, who attracted much attention in European literary circles last year for his seventieth birthday, is now generally recognized as Norway's most important novelist. His recent work "The Last Chapter" (Det Sidste Lapital) was a sensation when it was first published, but we cannot help but admit that this book is very depressing. The managers of the Turlaas Sanatorium (the setting of the book) are really unfortunate, not only because they repeatedly encounter the tragic deaths of their guests, but also because the customers they attract are all terrible characters. It is rare to see such a group of people, all terribly uniform, and living in the same house. It is really rare to see a novel like "The Last Chapter," which is completely filled with sinister characters.</p>
<p>The central figure, who seems to be used as a mouthpiece by the author to some extent, is a person suspected of having suicidal tendencies. However, this person's attachment to life is enough to make him try to refuse to give up his room with a stove. I constantly complain about the poor food. When his wife, who had just reconciled with him, died in the fire because the sanatorium was burned down, his "suicide" only took the step of hanging a rope on a tree branch. And because he was busy taking out the pine needles in his socks and trying to stop the pain in his burned hand, he gave up his intention to commit suicide. This character seems very ridiculous, but we originally knew that he is the embodiment of the theme of the book. What is the theme of this book? That is, human beings have the will to survive. Even if "survival" is nothing to love and nothing to gain, people still eagerly cling to their survival and try to avoid the inevitable "last chapter"--the arrival of death.</p>
<p>We are all in the team, we can naturally change our garrison, but we cannot change our "god of war." But, ah, our good God, how much we oppose this matter. When the god of death walks to the door, we stand on tiptoe, shushing him, but when he holds us in his arms... we fight.</p>
<p>Of course, it won't be long before we fall, and then our spirit will inevitably decline. Later we were buried in the earth, so what are we trying to get rid of? Isn't it just to make those who have not died feel more comfortable?</p>
<p>The author is manipulating his puppets with a terrible humor, writing in his unique style, but his gloomy satire is failing to hit the mark, because when he makes us look at human beings from his small mirror, we see it, but we can't see any resemblance between these poor bugs and ourselves. As we think about it, if that sanatorium could make its customers die earlier, it would not only be beneficial to them, but also to the world. What are such people doing in the world?</p>
