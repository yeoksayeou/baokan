<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c12">巴力斯坦亂事 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>昨路透電宣布巴力斯坦之亂事調查委員會報告。謂此次阿剌伯人仇殺猶太人。起原爲政治與民族志願之失望。最近因泣牆細故。惟並非仇視英人云云。該報告書請英政府儘速明白宣布政策。並决定泣牆所有權。以解糾紛。觀此則知巴力斯坦懸宕已久之回敎徒泣牆慘案。迄今猶未解决也。吾人欲知泣牆慘案之起因。可不一究回敎民族運動之歷史。</p>
<p>回敎民族。久被壓迫他種勢力之下。直至戰後受回敎革新之影響。於是遂勃然興起。凡回敎民族所在之地。幾無一不發生强烈之運動。如埃及印度之運動獨立。土耳其之復興。波斯之甦生。阿富爾之奮鬭。及摩洛哥阿刺伯等種種活動。均可爲回敎民族覺悟之明證。巴力斯坦之回敎。亦頗努力於奮起。但因其敎中猶太人少。阿刺伯人多。猶太人欲在巴力斯坦建設猶太民族國家。發起所謂輯安運動。大爲阿刺伯人所反對。内部遂起分裂。於一九二○年在耶路撒冷發生暴動後。屢起衝突。至去年八月爲爭一座泣牆。復發生阿刺伯人仇殺猶太人之大慘劇。回猶兩派。在行政上當然更不能合作。然回敎徒旣以運動獨立爲目的。理應和衷共濟。互相提携。一捐從前之嫌恨。乃竟尋仇不已。不可謂非回敎運動中之一憾事。而英政府對巴力斯坦。雖僅有託管之關係。（即國際聯盟委任統治）然因其接近蘇彝土河。關於軍事交通。甚爲重要。當然亦甚鄭重注意。不願其内部常起紛爭。今對於半年前所發生之亂事。猶未宣布其應付政策者。殆非因是非眞相未明。處理有所困難。而或别有一種策略在也。</p>

<p>本草案規定　金本位當在各省陸續推行、第一步須宣布一省或數省之金本位幣制通行日、此後新貨幣逐成爲法定貨幣、凡工資、存欵及任何他種交易均可用之、除財政部長另有規定外、政府亦按一孫等於一元之率以爲收付、在各便利地方、均設新貨幣交換處、使人民按財政部長所定之率、以舊貨幣換取新貨幣、此項官定率可以各省不同、且可隨時更變、　　自前述之日期起一年以内、又宣布所謂金本位法幣日之第二日期、此後唯金本位貨幣成爲締結契約之法定貨幣、此第</p>
<p>二日期不得在第一日期後未满一年、且至少須在實行前六個月公布之、　　第三日期爲債務換算日、此日期可與法幣日同時或不同時、惟不得在法幣日以前、其實行亦至少須在公告後六個月、此</p>
<p>後一切以　　　他種非金本位貨幣計算之債　　　　種種之支付、在满期之日、須按原爲此目的而規定之新舊貨幣換算率爲支付、此等債務換算率、以公布換算日以前九十日中每種貨幣之市價</p>
<p>爲根據、一經决定、永以爲例、　　現行銅幣暫時爲金本位制所容納本草案規定現行十文或一分銅幣、暫時繼續行使並爲金本位制所容納、現今此等貨幣之流通、其率各地不同、每銀元常可換銅幣三百枚左右、本草案規定立使</p>
<p>十文銅幣之流通額减少、至每孫可換二百枚爲止、此舉成功後、乃公布銅幣鞏固</p>
<p>日、此後、銅幣乃爲合法之金本位制之一部分、而其兌回、則按照每枚等於半分或二百枚等於一孫之率、</p>

<p>所含之銅、故政府將此等過多之銅幣收回、殊爲有利、銅幣流通額、自一孫換三百枚而收縮至一孫換二百枚、則其面値已增除銅價較今日更爲增高外、營利者便不能鎔之以圖利、</p>
<p>使現行十文銅幣容納於金本位制中、則金本位之採用及通行、均受其甚大之助力、以其可使人民習知一孫幣乃確實代表銅幣二百枚、五分鎳幣代表銅幣十枚、或一角鎳幣代表銅幣廿枚之故、鎳幣將成爲小宗交易之必要品、故可使政府得有鉅額之造幣權利益、俟舊銅幣鞏固後、乃逐漸代以小形之半分新銅幣、（未完）</p>

<p>田徑賽遼滬成勁敵　　足球滬隊定操必勝　　總錦標之推測男子組錦標八種、就兩日間之觀察、已得尋其線索、（一）田徑賽遼寗雖煊赫一時、未能操必勝、蓋上海亦聲勢洶洶已有十七分之最高紀綠、而遼寗天津、僅各以五分並列第二、惟遼寗徑賽成績極佳、錦標當爲滬遼所爭也、（二）足球上海必勝無疑、李惠堂現雖抱病、絕無影</p>
<p>響、除粵隊或能稍與對抗外、其餘皆經不起一</p>
<p>擊、（三）棒球上海亦具九成把握、（四）排球香港最堅强、滬隊第二週即遇港隊、殊爲不幸、執歷屆遠東牛耳之廣東隊、恐將不敵港隊、（五）棒球滬港津三隊實力平均、津隊投手甚好、滬隊總敎練昨已急電劉達城盧觀祥二人、請彼乘六日早車趕到大會、與天津複賽如獲勝利、則與港隊决戰、（六）籃球上海可包得决賽權、天津與北平俱强、但須</p>
<p>先行複賽、優勝者則再與上海爭冠軍、雙方機會爲五十與五□之比、（七）全能錦標、滬遼二單位、成對峙之局、餘子不足論列、（八）游泳是冷門、香港與上海、較爲有望、至論總錦標、上海當局屬首選、次爲港遼粵、</p>

<p>羣雄逐鹿之棒球比賽、其第一次出塲者乃上海與湖南、上海固以棒球著名、技藝自在湖南之上、比賽一局又半、上海已獲得十一分之多、湖南於技術知識、尙未得充分明瞭、實確與精銳之上海相較、至時自認失敗、全軍退塲、裁判員張信孚宣佈、上海以十一比○之結果獲勝、上海隊名單、盧濟滄·費福煦·安原生·陳璞·陳虞添·曾廣邦·周崇道·方定塤·沈觀瀾、足球</p>

<p>結果爲二比一　　競爭非常劇烈　　遼寗足球隊、多爲馮庸大學及東北大學之名手所組成、在華北素負盛譽、此次代表遼寗南來作戰、實力未可輕視、該隊領隊馮庸氏、亦極爲注意、故此行實抱有絕大之希望、浙江隊實力亦稱不弱、昨日下午一時、二隊戰於足球塲、競爭非常劇烈、結果遼寗以二與一獲勝、查浙江之敗由於後衛之不得力、前鋒以劉宗德表演最佳、守門員陸書田、亦時有驚人之表演、遼寗前鋒以勇敢勝、惜舉動過慢、射擊亦久準、</p>

<p>江隊左内鋒盤球直上、如入無人之境、正思攻門之際、忽被遼寗右後衛搶出傳與中鋒蔡思成、於是遼寗隊王前鋒如狼似虎、直拍浙江門前、右翼回榮章深入敵陣、將球挑送中央、劉寳琛趕上、一脚踼進、記錄乃開、上半時爲一與零、</p>

<p>第二日　　劉長春足傷無出色成績　　女英雄孫桂雲健步如飛　　一日田徑賽、短跑怪傑劉長春、除二百米外、殊無良好成績、觀衆頗爲失望、據蕭鼎華言、劉在滬練習時傷腿筋甚烈、幸急醫治、迄未全愈、深信赴遠東時、或可恢復、劉在百米中起步極慢、三十米後始用勁、故僅有此成績、但周兆元與鍾連基、均極努力、預料百米决賽、劉周鍾當有一番劇烈競爭、四百米中、劉似故意退讓、將達終點時、頻回首望、結果遂得第二、二百米劉殊有　　　　　林澤人攝勤、雖較蕭前次記錄二十二秒二相差頗多、但一日大會中、要不失爲前列成績也、女子徑賽、似以東特成績最佳、女英雄孫桂雲、健步如飛、槍聲起處、黃色制服耀人眼簾、與第二相距恒在十步以上、跑畢後、備受攝影者之包圍、鼓掌一片、</p>
<p>次王淵成績亦不惡、東特之得徑賽錦標、毫無疑義、孫年事正幼、姿勢極佳、勤加練習、不難成爲國際健將、高低欄賽中、殊無若何成績、千五百米東北俊傑又顯威風、趙德新姜雲龍互獲一二兩席、决賽時、大有舍我其誰之槪、跳高决賽、爲昨日最精彩之一幕、與賽者達五十餘人、至一米六八九時、僅津李仲三、遼傅寳瑞、平吳雲龍、滬蘇祖歇跳過、餘均三次未中、遼傅每次均被手帶落、尤覺可惜、滬蘇亦能努力應付、結果三人平分第二、旋李又跳過一次、高度爲一米七三、與全國成績尙差、當勤事練習、否則遠東恐無我地位、女鉛球决賽、成績爲七米八四五、全國紀錄爲八米三三、保持者陳新元、昨因精神不佳、竟致落選、甚屬可惜、尙望陳益爲奮勉於來屆、重獲優勝焉、　　第二日　　男百米　　昨日男子百米複賽、短跑健將劉長春鍾連基蔣鵬均奪得第一、劉之成績較前日已稍有進步、起步仍極遲緩、在五十米左右尤落人後、達終點時、奮力一衝、始超越郝春德、上海蔣鵬昨日賽中</p>
<p>成績甚佳、華北名將周兆元、且退居第二、預料百米决賽時、上海與遼寗當有極劇烈之競爭、劉長春若無十一秒以日内之成績、鍾蔣兩君當可與之逐鹿、奪取首席也、</p>
<p>男二百米　　男子二百米複賽、第一組起跑時、周恩德居首、劉長春起步仍極慢、至二百五十米左右、劉在第二、搖臂仰首奮趕、不料至終點、仍得第一、洵非易事、但成績實屬不佳、第二組天津周兆元、出發較鍾連基在先、鍾亦佳在終點時追及、决賽中南北二雄相遇、究不知鹿死誰手也、　　男八百米　　昨日八百米預賽中、成績殊不十分出色、第一組出發之第一圈中、遼寗郎大奎龐世榮即魚貫居首次兩席、不料至最後半圈時、竟被江蘇宋澤安搶上、殊出人意外、第二組出發時、遼寗薛玉祥又居首位、上海鄧志明在第二圈時追及、薛雖謁力奮追、卒不能及、預料在决賽中、遼寗倘不特别努力、恐難獲得全勝、　　女五十米　　昨日女子五十米複賽、東特區孫桂雲仍保持原有速度、奪得第一組第一、第二組中東特區名將王淵、以起跑過快、犯規二次、第三次未免、心寒、槍嚮後始敢起賽、努力衝趕、然距離過遠、卒至無法挽回、殊深可惜、　　　男高欄　　昨日高欄複賽、第一組中遼寗鼎華、仍保持第一位置、上海曹裕以起步較慢、至中段始漸次趕上、獲得第三、第二組出發時、北平王玉振健步如飛、即居首席、至八十米突破福建林紹洲超過、達終點時、林距王幾在十步以上、决賽中頗有希望、</p>
<p>男四百米　　昨日四百米複賽、短跑怪傑劉長春在第二組中、又保持第一、然成績仍未見佳、第一組第一廣東麥國珍、成績尙可、在决賽時、當與上海之朱瑞洪爭奪亞軍地盤也、　　鉛球</p>
<p>推十二磅鉛球决賽、計二十二選手比賽、殊無良好成績、均屬平平、遼寗樊廣武第三次推、即一三·一一五米、上海鉛球名手逮明、在第二次得一三·一○米、餘者均在一三米内、最第三次推擲、逮明以一三·三○米、躍居首席、豈知上海潘南順第六次用力一推、反以十三·三四得第一名、成績與全國成績十四·一一米、相差雖微、然與遠東成績十四·二三米、則相去遠矣、望努力加功、則庶幾有望也、</p>

<p>女子擲捧球决賽、實爲昨日成績最佳、全塲注意之一幕、英才薈萃、俱相差極微、擲三十三米以上者、計有七八人、廣東陳佩桃第一次擲去、即得三八·四六米、全塲鼓掌、玉臂一展、球如箭去、令人咋舌、第二湖南楊仁、第三北平胡瑞秀、成績俱在三四米以上、在上海成績三八米之樊瑞梅、竟致落選、殊可惜也、　　跳遠</p>
<p>跳遠决賽、上海郝春德雖以六·○一米居首、然成績並不能令人满意、平日試跳、俱寫寫意意跳六米以上、然郝僅以六·○一米得第一、廣東司徒光以○·○一米之差、屈居第二、田賽成績、均似較差、大約氣候亦有關係、連日春寒甚烈、能較爲和暖、成績或較佳美也、全國成績六·七四米、遠東成績七·○九米、以較此次之成績、望塵莫及矣、</p>

<p>由中國歷史文化上見到體育的意義　　全國運動大會會長戴季陶氏、此次來杭主持大會、親睹各地運動員參加之熱烈、體格之進步、</p>
<p>十分欣慰、除一日晚間在大會歡迎會上、有絕懇切之演說外、並發表重要之談話、從中國之立國基礎及歷代政治哲學上、闡明體育與政治相通之意義、茲錄共辭如下、　　中國國民近年來漸漸知道體育的重要、全國運動大會已經舉行過三回、但是由中央政府來發起主持、這次要算是第一回、我的意見、已經寫在大會開會辭上、但是還有一點感想、趁此時對大家談談、幾年來我在中國上古歷史上、關於民族構成與國家建設、發現一個特點、各國所無的、就是無論在政冶理論上、在政策上、皆以體育爲基礎、上古歷史、紀載不詳、頗不易知、但比之其他各國、不合理之神話、以中國爲最好、而</p>
<p>大體亦極正確、伏義時代、中國如有文字、神農則文治武功、均極遠大、統一的民族國家、在此時已立其基礎、至黃帝時、則偉大民族之構成、與偉大國家之建設、完全成功、故中國史家、頗多推尊黃帝爲中國民族的初祖、此兩代建國之基礎、皆極奇特、神農是一個醫藥的發明家、黃帝又是一個極偉大的醫學衛生的學者、今日所流傳之内經、或者不是黃帝時代的著作、但可以確信黃帝時之政治以醫學衛生爲一切政治理論和實際之根本、數千年來、中國民族、所能成其偉大者、完全在此、余於外國歷史、無所研究、但就余所知、則以醫藥衛生爲政治學理之基礎而建國帝王、以醫藥衛生爲專門技能的事、在外國史上、確是没有先例、固書之洪範、是否眞實、考據家頗有異議、但此書所載、大足以說明三代時政治哲學之大體、最少是記載商朝傳統的一種政治哲學、稱政治之目的、是人民造成五福、排除六極、所謂五福者、一曰壽、二曰富、三曰康寗</p>
<p>、四曰攸好德、五曰考終命、六極者、一曰凶短折、二曰疾、三曰憂、四曰貧、五曰惡、六曰弱、就此而觀、可見當時的政治、一切主張施設、第一</p>
<p>要義、就是在衛生、在爲人民謀長壽與健康、像這樣的政治理論、的確是偉大精確、爲各國所無非常切實、非常重要、後代把修身的道理治國的方法、越講越空、而道德的意義、也都幾乎變了神話、眞是可嘆、直到近代、我們中國民族、起死回生的導師、中華民國的建國者孫中山先生、又是一位醫學專家、先生在他的講心理建設的學說上、人類的一切文明、不外是歸到保養二個字、從修身本身天然的能力、去抵抗一切疾病、才能到健康、我相信總理的一切主義和政策、都是從這一個道理中體騐中得來、我因爲在歷史上發現出這幾件大事、再加之以自已幾回受到身體疾病的痛苦、和因疾病而障碍事業工作的痛苦、所以愈覺得體育衛生的重要、的確一切深遠偉大的智識、都要有强健的身心、才能獲得了也才能應用、至於道德的意義、我以爲能獲得强健的身體精神的方法、就是道、能夠自已努力不懈去作、並且帮助他人去作、就是德、能夠使團體有强健的組織和主義的方法、就是道、能夠努力不懈去作、並且帮助他人和其他團體去作、就是德、所以道德的意義、简直和體育衛生相通、並且有時竟可以作爲一個解釋、尤其在中國專講道德的道家、是完全把體育衛生、看成一切道德的本體、我們中國民族、衰弱到了極點、最大</p>
<p>的缺陷很明顯的就是身體精神都衰弱了、在外國無論是政治家、是軍人、是學者、是實業家、五</p>
<p>六十歲的還是壯年、要到得七八十歳、才稱得一個老字、本來無論那一種的事業、總要到四五十歳、才能學到、可以獨立創作、可以眞正有敎人的把握、有領導人的能力、如果四五十歲就死了衰了、便是一無成就、倘若一個民族、全體都是到四五十歲、就死了衰了、那這一個民族的文化、無論如何、創造不起來、在此刻要救中國民族在建設上、固然各種事業都緊要、而要救中國民族的本體、醫藥和體育兩件事、是十分的重要、醫藥還是消極的救治、是救已病已衰的人、只有講究體育才是積極的、重要造成百疾</p>
<p>不能侵、百毒不能害、强敵不能傷的金剛體有了這一個基礎、甚麽科學甚麽事業、才可以學得好、學了才可以施展得出、我自已固然願意如此努力、更全國的同胞、大家要了解這一個意義、要努力實行、無論是學校是各種團體、尤其是各鄉村、一定要把體育這一件事、認定是救已救人救國救世的唯一道路、盡力提倡、然後運動比賽、是爲達上述的目的一個方法、决不是中國擺擂臺那樣的意義、中國體育所以不能進</p>
<p>步、一半是吃了擺擂臺那種野蠻的虧、所以我們要知道、這要是誠心努力而參加各種比賽的人、優者勝者、故然値得大家稱贊、値得大家表揚、而本領差一些的、敗的、也一樣是値得大家稱贊、値得大家尊敬、一定要把封建時代擺擂臺的思想除却、遵守運動的規例、尊重運動的道德、然後體育運動、才能普及、才能化爲一種民衆的運動、這一層意思、更望各處的代表選手、大家十分認識、並且要望大家努力宣傳、</p>

<h3 id="c235">雌雞化雄 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 費公直</p>
<p>日前西市王姓。及前港胡姓家。同時有雄雞產卵之事。因憶去年更有雌雞雄化之異。亦經目睹。爰記之以供好奇者之助談資也。吳縣周莊鄉北市。距余居五六間之陳姓家。蓄雞數頭。晨起恒放食於宅後羨地。日以爲常。一日有牝雞無端雄化。日中則引吭而啼。後爲𨼺居所見。一時傳爲奇事余聞而往觀。伺至亭午。啼聲果作。且見其逐羣雌而交尾。至其形態。則冠肉尾羽漸見增長。舉止頓失雌性態度。羣謂家畜變化。恐有不祥。陳姓乃惑於無稽之談。遂斫其頭而烹之此十八年五月初事也。</p>
<p>按牝雞雄化時或偶有。見諸史載。亦屬不尠。但未之目睹耳。如漢宣黃龍元年。未央殿輅軨中。雌雞化爲雄。元帝初元中。丞相府史家。雌雞伏子。漸化爲雄。靈帝光各元年。南宮侍中寺。雌雞化雄。魏明帝景初二年。廷樹府中雌雞化爲雄。晉元帝太興中。王敦鎮武昌。有雌雞化爲雄。安帝隆安元年八月。瑯琊王道子家。青雌雞化爲赤雄雞。安帝元興二年。衡陽有雌雞化爲雄。此僅疆吏因變異而聞於朝。史官取而筆載之。其散見於荒村僻野而不聞者尚不知幾何矣。可見雞之爲禽最易變化而絕不聞有他禽之變異者。蓋體質或有時秉耳。在科學上論。自醫學家內分泌發見以來。知人身內藏。各有一種分泌物質。各具特異性能。與他藏產物在人體內起化學的聯誼作用。即體內化學上交互之關係。至於性之形成。與變化乃由生殖腺Keimdrisen主宰之。故可以人工的損益或調換而變更。若一經更換之後。則不僅影響於表面。即骨骼臓器。性質聲音。俱起變化。公元一千八百四十九年。Berthold氏。曾以睾丸移植之試騐於雞。能使閹者復其故態。若冠肉羽毛。啼聲交　等。凡雄雞之特性。無不俱備。其後數十年。更有Steinach氏。試以雌雄動物之生殖腺。互相交換。而能使雌者雄。雄者雌之。例如雞之雌者。長冠肉。換毛羽。發啼聲。起交尾。或鼠或兔。經換殖之後。即變柔弱之骨骼。纖軟之皮毛。豐滿之脂肪。肥大之乳頭及雌性固有之性狀。雄者見之。即起而揚尾追逐。乳房分泌乳汁而哺幼子。其所以有此昭著驚人之結果。並有一種覺醒素出Hormon之存在故也。就社會上而言。欲以簡單易曉之詞而證明其理。可將古來素有閹雞一術揣而摩之。思過半矣。</p>

<p>— 浪漫書生</p>
<p>程玉霜（艷秋）摟以體格日胖。輟演鑫時。傳者或謂其從茲不再登紅氍毹矣。望子成龍者惜之。蜍有客自津門來。則謂程方擊獻藝於津門之新新大戲院。不特身材未見十分臃腫。且歌腔益臻化境。而尤以演紅拂傳竺劇竟能參合眞劍術。而舞劍於歌臺上。推原其故。則以程方從師學拳之功也爰記客言。以告關心玉霜世事者。</p>
<p>先是。玉霜以春明館主之介。從拳師韓君學。旋復因事冗擱置。及後。體格日胖。作事呆滯。或有說者曰。惟學太極拳可解。玉霜善之。遂復隨高紫雲學。高君爲北方名拳師。曾充曹促珊氏之衛隊長。近則屏棄功名。悉心敎練。自得玉霜爲門下後啟復愛其敏而好學。悉授其技。玉霜亦頗專心從事習練不三月。而乾坤劍成。玉霜自謂對於劍術頗感興味。前在北平青年會曾一度加入臨時表演頗博得一般人之讚美。由是益鼓其進取之心。此次在津演經拂傳。即擷取劍術之精華。融入劇藝中。舞劍一幕。遂致出神入化。與普通演是劇者迥異。不特門外漢看來。五花八門頗多精彩。即拳術家觀之。亦讚歎不已云。</p>

<p>— 朱思忠</p>
<p>（一）舊鞋子升天</p>
<p>松江代步的東西。一向只有轎子。這轎子二字。在松江人嘴裏喊起來好像舊鞋子。前幾年轎子盛行的時候走在街上往往聽得一種舊鞋子……升天的聲浪。這就是轎夫警告行人轎子來了身體當心的意思。所以他用著縮短音說。轎子……升天。不料現在這許多舊鞋子。眞的升天去了。因爲自從拆橋以來。街上盛行黃包車。這許多舊鞋子好久沒有看見。這不是眞的長天去了嗎</p>
<p>（二）橫簸車</p>
<p>松并人喊黃包車。好像黃簸車。不料這黃簸車。眞下名副其實。何以呢。因爲松江的街道。仍舊是牢不可破的石板。而且不平的地方很多。這種黃包車拉在不平的路上。顚顚簸簸。偶一不愼就要被　它簸出在櫻橫邊咧。這枘簸車不是名副其實嗎</p>
<h3 id="c238">蘇垣捉狗屑 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 高岑竹</p>
<p>蘇垣捉野狗。昔在殷石笙任公安局長時代。即力倡之。卒因當地慈善家之反對。故未見諸事實。自鄒斅公繼任後。以野犬妨礙衛生。戕害人羣。在事實上言之。取締實不容稍緩。近經局務會議通過後。即一面通告辦理家犬登記手續畢。業於日前先從東區開始捕捉。趣事甚夥。今摭拾記之如左。</p>
<p>狗極實行跳墻　東區境內野狗收容所在埃門門口胡同祠堂後面園中兩旁蓋蘆蓆棚。以備羣狗憩息之所。四面墻垣。並不甚高。有兇驚之犬登棚上。竟能越垣而出俗有云人急跳樑狗急跳墻。信然信然。</p>
<p>坐狗車前後呼擁　捉狗器具。用三四尺長之竹管一根。一端繫籐圈。每見野犬即套在頸間抽住。使不得脫。然後擎其足。塞入狗車。車可容三四頭。捕獲後。一路推車送往收容所。警士數人隨之。又有觀者前後呼擁而進聲勢甚大。野狗登車。而有如此遭遇。亦足自豪矣。</p>
<p>野狗四出逃亡　此次捕捉野狗。並非全市同時實行。故東區境內之狗。四出逃亡他區。而每見身穿黑制服頭帶白邊帽之警士。即亡命奔避。不敬稍近蓋捉狗者均爲若輩警士。誰爲畜類無靈者哉。</p>
<p>捉狗中之阻力　捉狗本應全市同時並行始可收一網打盡之效。其所以先後分區捕捉。特設野狗收養所者。皆爲吳縣佛敎會之主張。有此阻力。所以不能澈底。故以東區一隅觀之。名雖捉盡。實則野狗依然逍遙市上。猶比比皆是也。</p>

<p>— 妍千</p>
<p>習俗移人。吾人固知之稔矣。而殺人則未之前聞也爰誌諸自由談</p>
<p>燒𦯁習俗　清明大如年之說。流傳區域至廣。而奉之至嚴莫如松滬。蓋每屆清明。除祭掃祖瑩之外。必須向親戚家燒𦯁。燒𦯁通稱燒草𦯁。草𦯁者。係以稻柴紮成。爲徑尺之扁圓器。中實山楮冥錠之屬。面蓋紅綠紙剪成之花。持此相互往來。以爲大禮。謂停止燒𦯁。即宣告斷絕親戚之誼云而諸親百戚之相互來往。從未有預約於同一日期行之者。故此去彼來。致家家添魚買肉忙個不了。據人預算。過此大如年之時節。至少需銀十五元。以災荒頻仍。百貨騰貴。生活維艱之世安得不爲之叫苦邊天乎。</p>
<p>習俗殺人　浦南南橋鄉間。有某姓農婦。以迭遭災荒。貪困已極。僅以紅花粥果腹。紅花者。即紫雲英也。農家故以此爲綠肥者。而此婦乃以之充饑。某日傍午。婦正啜此粥。而一客至。客之來也持有草𦯁。依例言。婦宜如何奔忙以欵此客。奈室無所貯何。當徬徨之際。而又有一客至。婦之情急。寧易形容。迺於怨愧交并之候。萌死念焉。一面勉強敷衍來客。旣肅客坐。即轉身入後室。一若預備欵客之具。孰知其已於此時自縊於破牀之前耶。客久待不見其出。呼之不應。始以爲異。相率入視。則已伸舌睜目。示說不出苦且恨之相矣。茍無是習俗。則婦雖貧困。尚不至遽思自殺也。謂爲習俗殺人。豈得云過。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十回　　赤燄騰天勾欄欽孝女　紅毹貼地即席晤名伶</p>
<p>原來那時候有一班日本留學生。聚了幾個都喜歡研究戲劇的同志。組織了一個劇社。就是那個青柳社。起初在日本的當兒。不過逢著幾個什么紀念的日子。借了一個小規模的劇場。偶然演演。他們稱之爲愛美劇。原不過幾個留學生中的有志於戲劇的人。隨意玩玩。也就像中國舊戲中的玩票。偶然也來個彩排客串之類。倒也閧動了留學界。這時中國的以劇。沒有開這個男女合演的風氣。所以男性的戲班裏沒有女人。所有裝成的旦角都是男性。京戲中有好幾位旦角。上妝以後。簡直和女人一般。瞧不出他是男人。而一班捧旦角的人。無論做什么詞章詩賦。也完全把他當女性看待。撲朔迷離。因此北方便有所謂相公一流人物。那時女人演劇的另有一派。就是最初謂之髦兒戲。後來稱之爲坤角。他們不能各男角一同登場。因此伊們戲中的男角。也以坤伶充之。居然也掛著鬍子。袍笏登場。只覺得雌聲雌氣。於視聽上都有些不合。我今且不必去提伊。單就新興的劇戲而言。裏面的女角。也都是男子扮演。這個青柳社裏。是個湖南人。這兩位都是豐神濯濯。如春日之柳。都是日本留學生中的美男子。因爲他們翩翩濁世。扮了女人以後。也自然美麗出眾了。就爲了濯濯如春柳。這個青柳社也便名副其實。此外有的人該演小生的。有的人該演老生的。甚而至於有的人生就了一副老太婆的面龐。在戲劇中只可以扮做老婆子的。倒也配搭得各如其分。他們也很考究化妝。這不比舊劇中的化妝。㚥臣是個白面。扮曹操的臉上還要畫一個十字。所有的戰將等。紅的黑的青的藍的。有奇奇怪怪的臉譜。新戲裏的化裝。只不過依照近時人的形狀加以點綴。或照劇中人的身分。加以描摹。不過美人名士。宵小英雄。也要在面目中顯得出來。這時青柳社的幾位社員。都回到國裏來了。他們預備在上海要公演一回。因爲有幾位同學。回國以後。農友內地的。便要回去省親。有的已經謀著了什麼職業。不久便要去就職了。趁此大家沒有離散的時候。非公演一回不可。</p>

<h3 id="e12">Disturbances in Palestine <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Reuters announced the report of the investigation committee on the disturbances in Palestine. The report stated that the origin of the Arab animosity towards the Jews was political and national aspirations. Recently, the Wailing Wall incident occurred. However, it was not out of animosity towards the British, etc. The report asked the British government to announce its policy as soon as possible and decide on the ownership of the Wailing Wall to resolve the dispute. From this, we can see that the tragedy of the Wailing Wall, which has been pending for a long time in Palestine, has not yet been resolved. If we want to know the cause of the Wailing Wall tragedy, we must examine the history of the Islamic national movement.</p>
<p>Islamic nations have long been oppressed by other forces. Until after the war, under the influence of Islamic reform, they suddenly rose up. Almost every place where Islamic nations are located has experienced a strong movement. For example, the movements for independence in Egypt and India, the revitalization of Turkey, the rejuvenation of Persia, the struggles of Afghanistan, and various activities such as Morocco and Arabia can all be clear evidence of the awakening of Islamic nations. The Muslims of Palestine are also working hard to rise up. However, because there are fewer Jews and more Arabs in their religion, the Jews want to build a Jewish national state in Palestine and launch the so-called Zionist movement, which is strongly opposed by the Arabs. Internal divisions arose, and after the riots in Jerusalem in 1920, conflicts occurred repeatedly. In August of last year, a major tragedy of Arabs killing Jews occurred again over the dispute over a Wailing Wall. The Jewish and Muslim factions certainly cannot cooperate in administration. However, since Muslims aim to move toward independence, they should be of one heart and mind, supporting each other, and abandoning previous grudges. It is regrettable that they are still seeking revenge. Although the British government only has a trusteeship relationship with Palestine (i.e., a mandate from the League of Nations), it is very important for military and transportation reasons because it is close to the Suez Canal, and of course it is very serious. It does not want internal disputes to arise frequently. Today, for the disturbances that occurred half a year ago, those who have not yet announced their response policy probably do not do so because the truth is not clear and there are difficulties in dealing with it, but perhaps there is another strategy.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Jinpu Railway Bureau reported to the Ministry of Railways, stating that recently the number of passengers traveling between the Jinan-Dezhou sections has been extremely crowded. Due to the shortage of vehicles, it is impossible to transport them. The coal used by the locomotives is almost impossible to supply. Since February 25th, up to now, Yan has seized vehicles, including four locomotives and forty-three passenger and freight cars. Repeated negotiations have failed to recover them. In recent days, most of the passengers heading north are poor people leaving the customs to seek food. This is the season of spring thaw, the time for cultivation, and assistance is urgently needed. The locomotive coal transport is the lifeline of the train. If there is a shortage, passenger transport will be completely suspended. The Tianjin Office of the Jinpu Railway reported that the Tianjin section has been occupied by the Jin army, and military operations in that section are completely blocked. There is no way to negotiate the return of these seized vehicles. In total, 8 vehicles were seized at Tianjin West Station, 31 vehicles at Tianjin General Station, 2 vehicles at Botou Town, and 2 vehicles at Cangzhou. 18 vehicles originally belonged to the Jinpu Railway, 11 to the Pinghan Railway, and 11 to the Beining Railway. The remaining belonged to the Longhai, Pingsui, and Daoqing Railways. The Ministry of Railways has now reported this to the Executive Yuan and the Army, Navy, and Air Force for their information.

<h3 id="e57">German New Cabinet Announces Major Policies <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Government Party Applauds Support</p>
<p>Opposition Parties Remain Silent for Now</p>
<p>Communist Party Proposes Vote of No Confidence</p>
<p>Guomin She, Berlin, 1st: The new German cabinet attended parliament for the first time today and announced its major policies. The government party applauded its support, while the opposition parties remained silent for now. Only the Communist Party raised some objections. When the new Chancellor, Dr. Brüning, took to the podium, the diplomatic and public galleries were already full. Brüning's remarks were brief and vague, so that parliamentary parties could also vote in favor. He first stated that the new cabinet was the last attempt to jointly resolve the country's pressing issues with the power of the state, and therefore asked parliament to allow the "organic development" of current foreign policy. He deeply understood that only through peaceful cooperation with other nations could the great task of restoring order be accomplished, and therefore guaranteed that the new cabinet would faithfully fulfill Germany's international obligations. He then discussed domestic issues in detail, stating that only by promoting economic progress could immediate relief be achieved. If there were anything endangering law and order, the new government was determined to eliminate it using all constitutional means. Finally, he stated that the previous government's financial procedures would continue to be implemented, and a plan for rationalizing government spending by various departments would soon be submitted to parliament. He also announced a special pro-agriculture plan to address the agricultural panic and the migration of farmers to cities. Finally, he stated that the government was determined to implement this policy swiftly and effectively. If it could not obtain a majority in parliament, it would dissolve parliament and request the president to grant special powers to carry out its policies. After the Chancellor finished reading, parliament immediately adjourned until tomorrow for discussion, at which time a vote of no confidence will be held on the Socialists' motion. Reuters, Berlin, 1st: German Chancellor Dr. Brüning announced the new cabinet's policies in parliament today, stating that the previous cabinet's foreign policy would continue, and all international treaties would be respected. It is necessary to handle important affairs as soon as possible. If the government's procedures are not approved, then the only option is to dissolve parliament. The Communist Party has proposed a vote of no confidence, scheduled for Friday.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Atmosphere of Five-Power Agreement Shows Progress <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>British and French Authorities Continue Discussions; Italy Prepares to Abandon Demands</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: It is heard that as a result of talks between British and French diplomatic authorities, the formula based on the sixth annex to the Locarno Treaty, which explains the responsibilities of member states of the League of Nations in wartime, was telegraphed to Paris last night for consideration by the French government. The Daily Express reports that Italy is now preparing to abandon its demands for equality with France, and the atmosphere of the Five-Power Agreement has made great progress.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st: This afternoon, British and French diplomatic authorities and their experts gathered to find a formula to satisfy France's demands for security. Britain does not wish to be bound by any obligations beyond those in existing peace treaties. A British official spokesman said today that political talks have progressed well in the past twenty-four hours and there has been a turning point. Today, the American naval experts are scheduled to return to the United States on April 12, and there are likely to be more members of the American delegation returning with them. It is also heard that the Japanese delegation headquarters in London has issued orders to move much of the furniture from its residence on April 18. According to sources on the American delegation side, the naval conference still aims at a Five-Power Agreement and there has been progress. As for the separate agreement between the United States and Japan, it is only part of the general work of the naval conference. The return of the three American naval experts and other members of the delegation to the United States only indicates that a large part of the practical work has now been completed. British Prime Minister MacDonald stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question from a member that the British government is unwilling to undertake any obligations beyond those defined in the League of Nations Charter and the Locarno Treaty revision. The French government has never asked the British government to increase its responsibilities. Guomin She, Paris, 1st: It is expected that the Five-Power Naval Conference will break down on Friday. French newspaper correspondents at the conference all say that mankind has lost its last hope, and even Briand, who is extremely optimistic, has shown disappointment. However, they believe that a Three-Power Treaty will eventually be signed to save face and shift responsibility for the failure to France. In fact, the failure of this conference is due to the blame being shared by Italy and Britain, because Britain has only repeatedly declared in the conference that it is unwilling to increase its responsibilities. It is also said that it is easier to find a formula within the League of Nations to provide France with security guarantees so that it can reduce naval tonnage.</p>

<p>Speculation Abounds</p>
<p>Reportedly Related to the Disappearance of White Russian Leader</p>
<p>Guomin She, Paris, 1st: There is much speculation about the visit of Oil King Sir Henri Deterding to French Prime Minister Tardieu. Most newspapers tonight believe that this is related to the disappearance of White Russian leader Kutepov, and that France is rapidly moving towards severing relations with Russia because the knight is extremely active in resolving this mystery. It is believed that the unnamed person who offered a reward of 500,000 francs some days ago for clues is this gentleman. White Russian newspapers even claim that the knight was invited to France by telegram by the French Prime Minister because he wanted to know whether the Anglo-Dutch company could supply France with the oil and its by-products it needs once France and Russia sever relations, and it is now heard that the knight has agreed to supply them. However, a small number of newspapers, including English-language newspapers, say that the knight's visit to the French Prime Minister is another issue, most likely related to the French management of oil imports.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Japanese Delegates' Return Instructions Arrive in London <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Plenipotentiary Group Once Reached an Agreement</p>
<p>The House of Peers Prepares to Impeach the Government</p>
<p>Dentsu, London, 1st: The return instructions have arrived in London, and their content is highly confidential, but it is known to be a very long document. It arrived in London at 1:00 PM London time on the 1st, and after translation, it was 5:00 PM. The navy appears quite saddened. The Plenipotentiary Group held a meeting at 10:00 PM on the 1st to discuss the timing and methods of negotiations with Britain and the United States. The navy also held a meeting at 8:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 2nd: The contents of the return instructions were mentioned in yesterday's telegram. The demand for large cruisers against the United States in the instructions has been reserved until the next conference. However, the form of this reservation, whether it is by note, exchange of supplementary documents, or a free declaration by the Japanese plenipotentiary, must be chosen from among the three. Which method to use will be decided by the plenipotentiary Wakatsuki. According to the results of Wakatsuki's private negotiations with the United States, a voluntary declaration seems appropriate. However, this is a major issue related to the life and death of 70% of Japan's claims, and the impact of the wording used is extremely significant. Therefore, the government must also carefully reconsider, or order the plenipotentiary to request further instructions.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 2nd: The House of Peers' Fair Society held an emergency general meeting on the 1st to exchange opinions on the return instructions. Baron Sakamoto said that the compromise plan was a short-term agreement, reserving 70% of the claims, but this was after 1936, and the effect was questionable. Count Inoue said that France and Italy each held their own opinions and did not care even if the conference broke down, but Japan willingly succumbed to a compromise. This proves the defects of Japanese diplomacy. Everyone was very indignant. As a result, it was decided to fully monitor the government's future attitude, and there was even talk of impeaching the government. Moreover, the Research Society and others were very dissatisfied with the government's excuse of a government agreement and disregard for national defense. Therefore, this issue has become a major domestic political issue.</p>
<p>Guomin She, London, 1st: It is reported that the Japanese delegation to the Naval Conference has notified the British and American representatives that the Japanese government has added some reservations to the American proposal for cruiser and submarine tonnage and requested the Emperor's approval. If approved, the Japanese representatives will sign the Tripartite Treaty.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 1st: American Federation of Labor President Green told the Senate committee investigating unemployment in America today that the government must provide for the unemployed, or there will be a revolution. It is estimated that there were 3.7 million unemployed workers in February.</p>
<p>Guomin She, Washington, 1st: American Federation of Labor President Green told the Senate Commerce Committee today that according to the Federation's March statistics, one in four people engaged in industry and commerce is unemployed. Green supported Senator Wagner's proposal to allocate US$150 million to relieve unemployment and said that if the major problem of unemployment is not resolved quickly, the country will likely face a revolution. Today, we cannot let workers starve because machines can replace labor, nor can we let workers leave factories because of temporary commercial stagnation. Green also stated emphatically that the country cannot withstand this kind of shock.</p>

<p>Reuters, Osaka, 2nd: The passage of the Tariff Law by the Indian Parliament has been widely discussed. General public opinion believes that Japanese plain cotton cloth will disappear from India in the future, and Japan will have to focus on bleached fine cloth and fine patterned cloth. The inevitable result will be a decrease in Indian cotton consumption, an increase in American cotton consumption, and an expansion of competition between British and Japanese cotton cloth. The Asahi Shimbun and other editorials expressed regret over the passage of the Indian Tariff Law, saying that the new tariff will make Indians pay more for cloth and reduce demand for Indian cotton exports. Japanese cotton goods manufacturers should work hard to reduce costs in the future. The Joint Committee of the Japan Cotton Industry Group is scheduled to meet this Friday to discuss this matter.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: When the coal mine bill was presented to the House of Commons today, Liberal MP Samuel expressed his opinion, saying that although the Liberal Party did not want to agree to many provisions of the bill, it did not think it appropriate to cause a major political storm at this time. Therefore, Liberal MPs did not vote on several amendments, giving the government a majority of 50 votes. From this, it can be seen that a political agreement between the government and the Liberal Party has begun.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Central Political Conference <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>221st Meeting The Central Political Conference held its 221st meeting at 9:00 AM today (2nd). The attending committee members were Lin Sen, Tan Yankai, Wang Chonghui, Gu Yingfen, Hu Hanmin, He Yingqin, and Sun Ke. The attending observers were Chen Lifu, Li Wenfan, Kong Xiangxi, and Liu Jiwen. The chairman was Tan Yankai. The matters discussed were as follows: (1) Report from the Legal Group, reviewing the case transferred from the Central Executive Committee by the Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee requesting the abolition of the deprivation of civil rights for bankrupt individuals. After investigating, the deprivation of civil rights is a type of accessory punishment. If there is no principal punishment, then the accessory punishment cannot exist. Therefore, simple bankruptcy without criminal issues will not lead to the deprivation of civil rights. The original case's concerns should be noted when drafting the bankruptcy law. Whether this is appropriate is still awaiting public decision. Decision: referred to the Legislative Yuan. (2) Report from the Legal Group, reviewing the case transferred from the Central Executive Committee by the Qingdao Special Municipality Party Affairs Guidance Committee requesting amendments to the law on the surrender of Communists. The request is to amend Article 7 of the law on the surrender of Communists to read "Surrender should be approved by a high-ranking party department before being made to the court or other government office." This is because they believe that high-ranking party departments are more accurate and knowledgeable in assessing the validity of a Communist's surrender than courts or other government offices. This is out of prudence and thoroughness and seems acceptable. Whether this is appropriate is still awaiting public decision. Decision: referred to the Legislative Yuan. (3) Report from the Ministry of Education regarding compliance with the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee to organize a committee for drafting educational plans, compile a national education improvement plan, and submit it to the National Education Conference for discussion. A paper for instruction is respectfully presented for approval. Decision: referred to the Education Group for review.</p>

<p>Han's Military Relocation Has Been Completed</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence Han Fuju was originally scheduled to leave for Jinan on the evening of the 30th. However, after learning that Ma Hongkui had arrived in Xuzhou from Jinan, he did not leave and remained at the Huayuan Hotel. Most of the accompanying personnel still stayed on the train. Mr. Haitao, who travels back and forth between Beijing and Kaifeng, also stayed at the same hotel. The reporter recently visited Mr. Haitao, who said that Commander Ma came to Xuzhou because he heard that Commander Han was in Xuzhou and needed to meet with Commander Liu. There were no other important matters. Commander Ma's special train arrived at the Xuzhou station at 4:00 AM today (31st). Commander Ma got out of the train and entered the city at about 5:00 AM and met with Commander Han at the Huayuan Hotel. He then went to headquarters to meet with Liu Zhi. It is heard that Han has been newly appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Suppression in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and has sent his secretary Zhang Shaotang to Beijing to meet with Chiang Kai-shek to report on the military relocation. He has also set up an office in Xuzhou to facilitate liaison, appointing Tian Wenzhong as the director and Chen Xibo as the deputy. As for Ma, it is heard that he has recently been ordered by Chiang Kai-shek to be responsible for handling the aftermath of Gao Guizi's remnants.</p>
<p>Regarding the relocation of Han's troops, according to recent news from the railway, the relocation of Han's troops has been completed. Armored trains with numbers such as Shandong Taishan and Beiping served as rear guards, with two infantry brigades flanking both sides of the railway line, slowly marching forward. Zhang Tingxian, captain of the Taishan armored train team, led his team to Xuzhou this morning. Zhao Jinshan, captain of the Beiping armored train team, led his team to Xuzhou this afternoon. Both were transferred to Yanzhou and then to Jining. The Shandong armored train is still patrolling around Liuhe Guide. The troops of Han's army marching on foot from eastern Henan to western Shandong are still in transit. It is heard that the vanguard of Wan Xuancai has passed Kaifeng and arrived at Luowang.</p>
<p>During this relocation of Han's troops, the main part and the supplies passing through Xuzhou consisted of more than a dozen trains. Adjutant Cao Xingzan, Transportation Commander Chen Guixin, and Military Grain Bureau Chief Mo Runtian all led their subordinates, military hospitals, and military supplies, causing very crowded transportation. By today, the military transport of Han's troops passing through Xuzhou has been completed. (March 31st)</p>

<p>Seven Bombers En Route</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence For the past two years, Liu Xiang has been actively expanding his military force and establishing an air force. Last time, the army accidentally killed and injured more than 100 military officers during a test launch of aircraft bombs. However, these two aircraft are not the largest, strongest, or most powerful equipment of the army. There are still seven large aircraft that have not yet arrived. Now, Guiyang and Hankou have sent telegrams stating that they are expected to arrive in Chongqing one after another in about a week. Originally, the army purchased nine aircraft. Three were purchased from Paris, and four were produced in Germany, contracted by a foreign company in Shanghai, and transported to Sichuan from Shanghai. They have now arrived in Hankou. As for the two aircraft that were test-flown at Guangyangba last time, they were manufactured in the United States and were the latest type of training aircraft, each worth 14,000 yuan and 90 horsepower each. The aircraft purchased in Germany and France are reconnaissance, fighter, and bomber aircraft, which can be used for aerial machine gun firing. They are larger than the two purchased in the United States, with a value ranging from 30,000 to 50,000. The German aircraft are the largest, with 372 horsepower and a value of 75,000 yuan. All aircraft are en route and should arrive in Chongqing soon. It is heard that Liu has hired a German aircraft instructor to open an aircraft training school, selecting 60 officers from the company, platoon, and squad levels to train as pilots. Classes will start soon. (China News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Guangzhou Agricultural Products Inspection Office <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Implementing Inspection of Agricultural Product Pests and Diseases</p>
<p>Officially Opens on April 1st</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangzhou Agricultural Products Inspection Office, established by order of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, has been handling the inspection of agricultural products in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, and other provinces. It has been conducting phased inspections of agricultural product raw materials, plant and animal pests and diseases, and fertilizers, based on the "Agricultural Product Inspection Regulations" promulgated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining. The fertilizer inspection has been in operation for several months, and the inspection procedures are quite thorough. Consequently, the counterfeit and substandard fertilizers being imported have been increasingly eradicated, benefiting farmers invisibly. The office recognizes that coastal Fujian and Guangdong have extensive international connections. Every year, a large number of plant seeds, seedlings, fruits, and aquatic products are imported and exported. This international movement of goods often serves as a medium for the spread of plant and animal pests and diseases. Examples include potato canker disease from the US to England, grape downy mildew from the US to France, citrus canker disease from Asia to the US, hibiscus scale insects from Japan to the US, and anthrax of livestock from Russia to Japan. The annual losses amount to tens of millions of dollars. It is estimated that the value of agricultural products imported into our country each year is over 700 million customs taels, according to statistics from 1929. In reality, many pests and diseases inevitably reside within them. For instance, China did not have rinderpest in ancient times, but it is now prevalent everywhere, causing severe damage and huge losses to farmers. The origin of this pathogen is believed to be from Europe. The introduction of other pests and diseases is also a cause for concern. For example, the Mexican boll weevil is extremely harmful to cotton production in the United States, and the annual import of American cotton into our country reaches about 200,000 dan (a unit of weight). The opportunity for this insect to be introduced is self-evident. Furthermore, many kinds of pathogens and pests, in their original habitats, are not very harmful due to the constraints of climate and natural enemies, or the strong resistance of the host. Once they are transferred to a different location, they lose their balance and can cause major disasters, as exemplified by the grape phylloxera imported from America to France. Therefore, advanced countries in the East and West, recognizing the danger of the spread of agricultural product pests and diseases, have established specialized agencies to inspect agricultural products for export and import, according to legal procedures, before they are allowed to be transported, to prevent problems before they occur. Our country's exported agricultural products often have attached pathogens and pests. They are either tragically burned or required to pay heavy ransoms for fumigation before they can be imported. As a result, some merchants, for convenience, transport agricultural products to Yokohama, where the Japanese inspection office performs inspections and issues certificates before they are transported to Honolulu, San Francisco, Seattle, and other places for sale. Furthermore, in January 1925, the Dutch government notified the former Beijing Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that from July 1st of the same year, all agricultural products transported from China to Dutch territories must be certified by a responsible agency as being free of dangerous pests and diseases before they are allowed to be imported. However, the former foreign affairs authorities shelved the matter and did not address it. Since then, our country's agricultural products have been unable to enter Dutch territory, resulting in countless losses over the years. In order to guarantee the credit of exported agricultural products and prevent the spread of imported pests and diseases, the office, in accordance with the methods of various countries, submitted a request to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining to add an agricultural product inspection department to handle pest and disease inspection matters. The Ministry has approved the request and will initially inspect four types of products: seeds, seedlings, fruits, and aquatic products. Branch offices will be established in Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shantou, and other places to handle fertilizer and pest and disease inspections, in the hope that plant and animal pests and diseases can be gradually eradicated, and to recover domestic and international losses. It is reported that the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining has dispatched Zhang Jingou to Guangdong to preside over the implementation. Other inspection personnel have also been appointed separately. Preparations are now complete, and the office is scheduled to officially open on April 1st. (March 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Reconstruction Plan for the Huanghuagang Martyrs Cemetery <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Entire Project is Divided into Three Phases</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangdong Provincial Government and the Revolutionary Memorial Society have recently determined that the Huanghuagang Seventy-Two Martyrs Cemetery has been neglected for a long time, and various buildings have been added arbitrarily without a concrete plan, while the construction projects that should have been carried out have not been implemented. It has been decided to add a Seventy-Two Martyrs Photo Gallery and inscriptions in the cemetery. The Provincial Government has hired Lin Yun'gai, Lin Zhimian, Hu Yisheng, and Deng Yanhua to oversee the engineering surveys and planning. Recently, Lin Yun'gai and others have submitted a "Building Opinion on Reconstructing Huanghuagang" to the Provincial Government, based on their survey results. The content roughly states that the Huanghuagang Seventy-Two Martyrs Cemetery should be in the style of a cemetery, not a park. The current plans for tea pavilions, pools, etc., greatly detract from the solemnity of a cemetery. This is something that architecture should pay attention to. The buildings and all the arrangements in Huanghuagang should aim for solemnity and grandeur, so that later generations who come to this place will feel respect and awe. It should not give people the feeling of being in a garden or playground. Therefore, colorful wine shops, mahjong parlors, and tea pavilions should not be added to avoid creating a sense of irreverence. The proposed reconstruction is roughly divided into three phases. In the first phase, the most economical and easiest to implement changes will be made first. (1) The small and pointed stele in the middle of the martyrs' graves should be removed, and a Chinese-style stele should be erected in front of it, with the words "Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs" written on it. The tomb should be built into an ancient steamed bun shape and planted with green grass. The location of the martyrs' memorial碑 is most suitable in the骆墓 area, because that place is high and open, making it easy to attract attention from near and far. (2) The existing music stage is not in the style of a music stage, and the inscription "Sharing Joy with All" is very inappropriate. It would be a laughing stock for generations to make music and seek pleasure in front of the tomb. It should be removed immediately, and there is no need to establish a music stage. (3) The inscription pavilion is too inferior and should also be removed (the stone tablet will be relocated separately). (4) Near the music pavilion is the tomb marker of General Yu, which looks like a stele pavilion or a paper burner. It is ugly and unsightly and should be removed. The tomb marker should be moved to the Revolutionary Memorial Hall for display, because none of the seventy-two martyrs have tomb markers, and it is too unique for General Yu alone to have one. (5) Plant old cypress trees on both sides of the main road and on both sides of the branch roads to create a solemn atmosphere. Seasonal flowers can be displayed on the grass on the right side of the tomb, but should not be arbitrarily displayed in front of the tomb. (6) The cemetery and the large grassland on the right should be planted with ancient pine and red cotton trees to show that they are connected to the cemetery but separated by the meaning. (7) The stone incense burner pillars are too dilapidated and should be removed. (8) Now that the boundary line of the cemetery has been clearly defined and is dedicated to the tomb of the seventy-two martyrs, how can other steles and tombs be allowed to be mixed in? Tombs such as the 骆墓, Du Shunchang tomb, and Shi tomb should all be moved out of the cemetery of the seventy-two martyrs to show respect. (9) The red house on the left side of the memorial archway is an irregular shape compared to the memorial archway and should be removed. (10) The Statue of Liberty in the memorial field is an idol worshiped by people from other countries. The tomb of the seventy-two martyrs is set up to worship the Chinese revolutionary martyrs. Placing the Statue of Liberty in the cemetery is tantamount to letting a foreigner live in supreme honor and surpass the seventy-two martyrs, which is a big mistake. If you want to take back the meaning of our freedom, you can move the Statue of Liberty to a suitable location and just use it as decoration, but the technology is too bad. (11) The location of the pool is not level with the road in front of the tomb, and it has no special meaning in terms of art. For the sake of temporary convenience, it should be changed to a round shape to enhance the grandeur, and special attention should be paid to the decoration of the pool in terms of Chinese and foreign art. Second Phase: (1) Acquire the fields under the moon platform in front of the tomb to build roads, dismantle the existing moon platform, and connect it to the main road in the front, leading directly to Dongsha Road. It would be best to acquire all the land on both sides of the road, along Dongsha Road to the east to the edge of the hill and to the west to the intersection of the existing archway. If not much can be done, at least one hundred feet should be acquired on both sides of the road. Moreover, there is a lot of unused land in the northwest corner of the cemetery, which can be exchanged for the land planned to be acquired in front. When the tomb has been changed into an ancient steamed bun shape, a new ancient-style stele will be built and erected in front of the tomb, with the seven big characters "Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs" inscribed on it. (2) At the entrance of the main road from Dongsha Road, build a magnificent and simple archway, with Mr. Sun's inscription "Great Spirit Lives Forever" embedded in it, which will be the main entrance. The existing main entrance will be changed to a side door. (3) The four characters "Great Spirit Lives Forever" inscribed by the Premier on the memorial archway at the back should be re-engraved on the front archway to make it look grand and solemn. The four characters should be combined into one to make it look generous. The inscription should be in one line and should not be messed up, so that it can be seen from near and far and arouse memories and respect. (4) When there are sufficient funds, the branch roads on both sides should be widened appropriately. Third Phase: (1) Projects that are too grand. (2) Projects that are too difficult to finance. (3) Projects that take too long. (4) Projects that have not yet attracted the attention of most people. (5) Other matters will be included in the third phase. In order to temporarily save trouble, they are not explained in detail. It is best to set up another committee to temporarily manage the above plan. After the management is completed, it will be handed over to the Revolutionary Memorial Society for management. (March 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Crisis of the Northeast Railways <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Debt Status of the Siping-Taonan, Taonan-Ang'angxi, Jilin-Changchun, and Jilin-Dunhua Railways</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The Northeast region has a network of railways that is among the best in the country. However, its debt is deep and its operations are losing money. A thorough investigation reveals a situation that is truly chilling. Currently, with the exception of the Shenhai, Huhuai, and Jihai Railways, the Bei'ning Railway has borrowed British funds, and its operations can still be maintained. However, the Siping-Taonan, Taonan-Ang'angxi, Jilin-Changchun, and Jilin-Dunhua Railways, which have borrowed Japanese funds, are all nominally built with borrowed funds, but the methods of borrowing are different. The Jilin-Changchun Railway entrusted the management to an agent, the Siping-Taonan Railway issued bonds, and the Jilin-Dunhua and Taonan-Ang'angxi Railways contracted the construction projects. If the conditions were appropriate and they were properly utilized, it would not be impossible to use them for development. However, these four railways failed to utilize foreign capital and were instead utilized by foreign capital. They were exploited and eroded and are on the verge of death, which is truly lamentable. The Northeast Communications Committee previously convened a communications conference to try to find a quick solution, but based on the current situation of each railway, it is feared that it will be difficult to remedy the situation. The operational debt situation of the Siping-Taonan, Taonan-Ang'angxi, Jilin-Changchun, and Jilin-Dunhua Railways is investigated as follows:</p>
<p>Debt Amount</p>
<p>(1) Siping-Taonan Railway: When building the Siping-Zhengjiatun line in 1915, it borrowed 5 million Japanese yen from the Yokohama Specie Bank. The term of the loan was set at 40 years. The important conditions were that during the term of the loan, the chief engineer, traffic manager, and chief accountant of the railway must be Japanese. The interest rate on the loan was 5% per annum. When it was extended to Siping-Taonan in 1920, it continued to borrow, for a total of 45 million yen. A new Siping-Taonan loan contract was signed, which included the original 5 million yen borrowed for Siping-Zhengjiatun. At that time, the Yokohama Specie Bank's claim was completely transferred to the South Manchuria Railway Company. After the contract was established, the South Manchuria Railway Company was also unable to handle the large amount of money and tried to raise funds in major European and American markets. Due to the European War, it was unable to do so. It had no choice but to revise the contract into a short-term contract of 10 million yen, with the same conditions as before, but the annual interest rate was increased to 9%, and it was compound interest. As of the end of May 1925, the railway's debt had reached 32 million yen. At that time, the railway director dared not continue to sign a rollover contract and repeatedly negotiated with the creditor to reduce the interest rate, but it was futile. From June 1925 to the end of December of last year, the railway's loan interest had accumulated to more than 15 million Japanese yen. The total of principal and interest was more than 52 million Japanese yen. (2) Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway: The Taonan-Ang'angxi loan was made by signing a contract with the South Manchuria Railway Company to contract the construction project. The total estimated cost of the entire railway project was 12.92 million yen. The main condition was that the railway should hire a Japanese consultant, whose powers were incomparable to those of consultants in various Chinese agencies. He could represent the South Manchuria Railway Company and have overall administrative power over the railway. The advance payment budget was itemized, but when the final accounts were submitted, the South Manchuria Railway Company suddenly added 2 million yen for various expenses (various expenses including entertainment expenses, or possibly movement expenses, are also unknown). The purpose of these various expenses was purely for purposes outside the railway before the construction project was contracted, so they could not be included in the advance payment. The railway bureau initially requested a reduction, but then denied it altogether, saying that the expenses had not been submitted to the province. The South Manchuria Railway Company not only refused to cancel it, but also did not express any intention of reducing it. Negotiations are still ongoing. In addition, there are three other things that are worth noting: 1. The South Manchuria Railway Company advanced more than 2.36 million Japanese yen for the purchase of vehicles, with interest accruing from December 17, 1928, at an interest rate of 9%. 2. Short-term loan for fuel and coal prices was more than 800,000 Japanese yen, which was added to the principal and calculated as compound interest (the railway's coal was purchased from Japanese factories, with a price of 17 yen per ton, which is about double the price of domestic goods. This may be limited by the contract relationship, and there is nothing that can be done about it). 3. The Liaoning Provincial Government previously borrowed 2 million Japanese yen from the railway at an annual interest rate of 9%, which has not yet been repaid. The railway's bridge construction fee refers to this loan. If it is not repaid, it will inevitably be added to the principal and calculated as compound interest. In total, the railway has borrowed more than 20.79 million Japanese yen in total before and after. (3) Jilin-Dunhua Railway: The original loan for the railway was 18 million Japanese yen, and then another 6 million Japanese yen was added, for a total of 24 million Japanese yen. It was also invested by the South Manchuria Railway Company and a construction contract was signed. The interest rate was also between 9%. The main condition was to hire a Japanese chief engineer, whose powers were the same as the consultant of the Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway, but the engineering was shoddy and almost unusable. The biggest problem is the railway's project acceptance. According to the report of the project acceptance committee sent by the Transportation Committee, the total project cost was at most more than 13 million Japanese yen, while the railway's accounts show more than 26 million Japanese yen (including interest). It is reported that the railway project had just been completed and had not been investigated, but the chairman of the railway project acceptance committee replied to the acceptance. (The chairman of the committee is Mr. So-and-so, the supervisory section chief of the railway, who is from Lishu County and graduated from a certain middle school and has a marriage relationship with the railway director.) The Transportation Committee is now thoroughly investigating this matter. (4) Jilin-Changchun Railway: The original loan for the railway was 2.5 million Japanese yen. In 1918, another 4 million Japanese yen was borrowed from the South Manchuria Railway Company, for a total of 6.5 million Japanese yen, with an annual interest rate of 5% and a term of 30 years. The fatal condition was that during the term of the loan, the railway was entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway Company to be managed. The railway bureau purchased 80-pound steel rails, and the South Manchuria Railway Company advanced 1 million Japanese yen, with an annual compound interest rate of 9%. The steel rails were purely old materials and did not comply with the approved original plan. It was also agreed with the South Manchuria Railway Company that interest should be calculated twice a year before a formal loan contract was signed and added to the principal for compound interest. The aforementioned interest totaled more than 80,000 Japanese yen as of the end of 1928, and the interest for 1929 is not included. In total, the railway has a debt of more than 8.91 million Japanese yen before and after.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Operational Status <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>(1) Siping-Taonan: In 1928, the railway's operating revenue was more than 6.06 million yuan, operating expenses were more than 3.61 million yuan, and the interest payable on loans was more than 5.42 million yuan. After offsetting revenue and expenditure, there was a shortfall of more than 2.97 million yuan. (2) Taonan-Ang'angxi: In 1928, the railway's operating revenue was more than 2.2 million yuan, operating expenses were more than 1.9 million yuan, and the interest payable on various advances was more than 2.24 million yuan. After offsetting revenue and expenditure, there was a shortfall of more than 1.92 million yuan. (3) Jilin-Changchun: In 1928, the railway's operating revenue was more than 3.62 million yuan, operating expenses were more than 2.55 million yuan, and the interest payable on loans was more than 660,000 yuan. After offsetting revenue and expenditure, there was a surplus of 40,000 yuan. (4) Jilin-Dunhua: The railway opened for business in the second half of 1928. The revenue and expenditure situation has not yet been calculated. However, the area is remote and the railway is just beginning operations. Both passenger and freight transportation are far less prosperous than the above railways. It can be asserted that there will be no huge revenue, and the more than 2.81 million yuan of interest payable on advances each year is an unavoidable expense. In total, the income of the above four railways, except for the Jilin-Changchun Railway, which has less loan interest and can still cope, the total income of the rest is only enough to cover the interest, or even not enough to cover the interest, and the compound interest is increasing without end. In the future, the total debt will become progressively larger, which is truly the crisis of the Northeast Railways. (March 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Second Trial of the Gao Ying Appeal Case (Continued) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Further Interrogation of Gao Ying</p>
<p>Judge: Did you say that the consulate did not have the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' seals?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Judge: Then where did the seals on your luggage come from?</p>
<p>Answer: If they are not fake, then they were obtained from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I think they were probably obtained from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Judge: Have you ever obtained them?</p>
<p>Answer: I have never obtained them.</p>
<p>Judge: Then you should know that these seals were obtained from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?</p>
<p>Answer: If they were not obtained from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, then they were privately made.</p>
<p>Judge: It is not surprising to privately make seals. It is even easier to privately make documents. But are the seals on your luggage from the consulate?</p>
<p>Answer: The consulate has never obtained seals from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so these seals were definitely not issued by our consulate.</p>
<p>Judge: Do you know Shen Guang and the other four people?</p>
<p>Answer: No.</p>
<p>Judge: These people have already been investigated by the Guangdong High Court. Now we have a reply stating that they have no dealings with the Hong Kong and Guangdong Bank. Now, please take a look at this letter. (Shows the reply for review) You all said that you don't know the addresses of these people. Our court has specifically investigated the Hong Kong and Guangdong Bank for the sake of prudence. (After reading the letter, Gao Ying returned the original to the judge without answering)</p>
<p>Judge: Chen Sheng lives on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai, but we have investigated and cannot find him. Do you know where he lives on North Sichuan Road?</p>
<p>Answer: I went to the United States in 1925, so I don't know.</p>
<p>Finally, Gao Ying requested to make the following points: (1) Regarding the seals, the seals are from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, not the consulate. Therefore, the Jiangning District Court's judgment that the seals are from the consulate is not valid. Moreover, of the fourteen pieces of luggage, three of my own did not have seals, and only the eleven pieces entrusted by Chen Sheng had seals. (3) The Jiangning District Court's judgment that I went to the pier to greet and take care of the luggage is also not true. I went to the pier to pick up my wife and did not take care of other things. (3) The judgment stated that when I detained the boxes at the customs, I telegraphed Minister Wu, claiming that there were a small amount of drugs in the boxes, which my wife had brought under someone else's influence, and requested assistance. The word "influence" is a mistranslation of the telegram code. It should be the word "deceived." At that time, I asked Mr. Huamo, the tax officer of the customs, and he said that according to the report of Harris and Smeth, the drug section members of the customs detective department, there were drugs in the boxes, and that was when I found out.</p>
<p>Judge: The judgment also stated that I firmly refused to announce the names of the people who contacted and transported Ya opium in China and San Francisco, etc., which was also a report made by Consul General Gong to Minister Wu because of a disagreement between Consul General Gong and me. When Gao Ying stated this, Lawyer Liu Shifang presented a letter from Lawyer Walter Lair, the legal advisor of the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco, proving that Consul General Gong and Gao Ying had disagreements. Please pay attention to the court. At that time, he presented the letter for review. After reading it, the judge returned it. Gao Ying replied that the above points should be carefully investigated by the court to clarify the truth. It was already past three o'clock. The clerk stood up to read the confession and ordered Gao Ying, Gao Liao, and Sun Yuan to sign separately. The judge announced that the case would be further investigated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and that a retrial would be scheduled. The court was adjourned.</p>
<p>Appendix: Letter from Lawyer Walter Lair of San Francisco to Lawyer Liu Shifang</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I have received your letter of January 16 regarding the Gao Ying case. I am very willing to assist Mr. Gao as you mentioned in your letter. However, due to my position, it would not only be detrimental to my duties, but also very difficult. Because I am still the legal advisor of the Consulate of former Consul General Gong and have not yet reached the end of my term. In addition, there are Mr. Gong's property and other matters (Mr. Gong currently holds a power of attorney). Before Mr. Gong leaves the United States to return to China, I will complete the cleanup for him. Therefore, if I make any statements about Mr. Gong, it will be presented to the Chinese court as evidence, and the Chinese newspapers here will reprint it. It is extremely difficult for me to publish my business and legal affairs as Mr. Gong's lawyer and draw attention from all parties. I hope you will forgive me for this situation. It is well known that Mr. Gong and Mr. Gao Ying have disagreements. However, it is very inconvenient for me to participate in the matter on my own initiative in this current situation. Mr. Gong is still in this port and will not return to China this month. I think you know this. Mr. Gao Ying's letter has been received. I will try my best to inquire about the matters mentioned. Please inform and explain to Mr. Gao that I am not allowed to receive English letters because he is detained in the detention center. Please explain my duties and position to Mr. Gong, because you are also a lawyer and understand the etiquette that should be observed in the performance of duties.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Walter Lair</p>

<h3 id="e78">Second Robbery of Zhangyan Town in Jinshan <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Songjiang Telegram: The county government received a long-distance phone call from Tinglin last night (the 1st), reporting that over thirty bandit ships, carrying more than four hundred bandits armed with guns, had come to the neighboring town of Zhangyan. They passed through Songyin Town around 4-5 PM and headed straight for Zhangyan, towed by small steamers. Gunfire could now be faintly heard in Tinglin, which is only eighteen miles from Zhangyan, making the situation very critical. In addition to sending detectives in separate groups to investigate, the Public Security Bureau had first sent an urgent report, and so on. At the same time, the Water Police Department also received the same telegram from Liu Zigao, the leader of the first squad stationed in Zhu. It is found that Zhangyan is the leading town of Jinshan County with prosperous commerce. It was once robbed by bandits last October, with losses of tens of thousands of yuan. Later, its defense capabilities were strengthened, and security guards and firearms were added. Unexpectedly, not long after, it suffered a second robbery disaster, which is truly shocking. According to inquiries from various sources, the gang of bandits numbered over four hundred, divided into thirty-six boats. First, they seized a small steamer at the entrance of the Cuanlai Temple to tow them. When passing through Songyin Town at about 4 PM, the townspeople knew something was wrong when they saw a large number of tugboats. After the bandit boats passed, they telegraphed Tinglin to be on guard. Some bandits had already been lurking in Zhangyan, first spreading rumors to create a terrifying atmosphere. In the evening, a large group of bandits went ashore to seize weapons from the Public Security Bureau. The security guards and police officers immediately went on duty to resist, but due to their numerical disadvantage, two guards and police officers were killed, and three were injured. Most of the firearms were seized. The shops in the town did not have time to close their doors and had to let the bandits search and plunder. Li Xinglin, a clerk of a pawnshop, was kidnapped by the bandits. Anyone with a little wealth was kidnapped, but the number of people taken is unknown. Only Mr. Yao Shizi was talking on the phone with Songjiang. As soon as he hung up the receiver, he heard gunfire everywhere. Knowing that something had happened, he sneaked out the back door and hid in the countryside, fortunately avoiding being kidnapped. At the same time, more than fifty students, both male and female, from Liuxi Elementary School were all kidnapped. During the fierce fighting between the police and the bandits, bullets were flying everywhere, and many civilians were injured. The looting ended at 11 PM. A bandit who seemed to be the leader blew a whistle to gather the team and get on the boat, and forced the Shanghai-Zhangyan passenger ship to tow them. The bandits carried the stolen goods and escorted the hostages, one after another, getting off the boat all the way. They looked very calm, carrying the loot and the hostages down the boat. It is said that they left via Zhangjing and passed through the No. 34 railway bridge, probably using Mao Lake as their destination. Zhang Yunfeng, the first district inspector of the Provincial Water Police Force, is currently leading shallow-water warships to pursue them. The whereabouts of all the hijacked boats and hostages are unknown, and the losses are feared to be greater than the first robbery last year. Today, the shops in the town are said to be closed. The citizens are uneasy because some of them have been kidnapped. The situation is filled with sorrow and disaster, and the aftermath is feared to be difficult to handle. Except for guarding the key passes, most of the troops under He Yalin of the Water Police have been ordered to gather in Jinze and other places to join forces with the second, third, and fourth divisions to encircle and suppress the bandit gang of Taibao Ashu. Therefore, there were no water police stationed in Zhangyan. Captain He himself was in Shanghai for medical treatment yesterday. According to the telephone report from the team headquarters, he hurriedly returned to Songjiang this morning. After making proper arrangements, he went to the Minhang District headquarters to report. He must return to Songjiang in the afternoon and lead his team to patrol the key passes in Cuanlai Temple and other places. According to general reports, the bandits who robbed Zhangyan yesterday mostly spoke with a Jiangbei accent, similar to the Siyang gang who came to rob last year. The leader of the Siyang gang is Zhang Shaohua, and his strength is even greater than last year. This is recorded for verification. After receiving the long-distance telephone report from Tinglin, the county government here immediately instructed its subordinates to be strictly on guard. On the one hand, it telegraphed the Jinshan County government to inquire about the robbery. It is said that it will petition the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to continue to send troops to Songjiang to strengthen defense.</p>

<p>China Gradually Adopts the Gold Standard</p>
<p>Summary of the Draft Currency Law (Continued)</p>
<p>Gradual Adoption of the Gold Standard</p>
<p>The draft stipulates that the gold standard should be gradually implemented in various provinces. The first step is to announce the date of the gold standard currency system in one or several provinces. After that, the new currency will gradually become legal tender, and it can be used for wages, deposits, and any other transactions. Unless otherwise stipulated by the Minister of Finance, the government will also use it for receipts and payments at the rate of one Sun equal to one yuan. New currency exchange offices will be set up in various convenient places so that people can exchange old currency for new currency at the rate set by the Minister of Finance. This official rate may vary from province to province and can be changed at any time. Within one year from the aforementioned date, the second date, the so-called Gold Standard Legal Tender Date, will be announced. After that, only gold standard currency will become legal tender for concluding contracts. The second date shall not be less than one year after the first date and shall be announced at least six months before implementation. The third date is the Debt Conversion Date. This date may be the same as or different from the Legal Tender Date, but it shall not be before the Legal Tender Date, and its implementation shall be at least six months after the announcement. After that, all payments of debts calculated in other non-gold standard currencies shall be paid at the expiration date at the exchange rate of new and old currencies originally stipulated for this purpose. These debt conversion rates are based on the market price of each currency in the 90 days before the announcement of the conversion date. Once determined, it will be used as an example forever. The current copper coins are temporarily accommodated by the gold standard. The draft stipulates that the current ten-wen or one-fen copper coins will continue to be used temporarily and accommodated by the gold standard. The circulation rate of these currencies varies from place to place, and about 300 copper coins can often be exchanged for one silver dollar. The draft stipulates that the circulation of ten-wen copper coins should be reduced to 200 coins per Sun. After this is successful, the Copper Coin Consolidation Date will be announced. After that, copper coins will become a legitimate part of the gold standard, and their redemption will be at a rate of one-half fen per coin or 200 coins per Sun. The copper content of the current ten-wen copper coins is higher than their face value, and private individuals melt the copper coins to extract the copper they contain. Therefore, it is beneficial for the government to recover these excessive copper coins. When the circulation of copper coins is reduced from 300 coins per Sun to 200 coins per Sun, their face value has increased. Unless the price of copper is higher than it is today, profiteers will not be able to melt them for profit. Making the current ten-wen copper coins accommodate the gold standard will greatly help the adoption and circulation of the gold standard, because it can make people know that one Sun coin actually represents 200 copper coins, a five-fen nickel coin represents 10 copper coins, or a one-jiao nickel coin represents 20 copper coins. Nickel coins will become a necessity for small transactions, so the government can have huge minting profits. After the old copper coins are consolidated, they will be gradually replaced by small half-fen new copper coins (to be continued).</p>

<p>Track and Field, Liaoning and Shanghai Become Strong Rivals Football, Shanghai Team Surely Victorious Prediction of the overall championship: There are eight types of championships in the men's group. Based on the observations of the past two days, clues have been found: (1) Although Liaoning was brilliant for a while in track and field, it has not been able to ensure victory. Shanghai's momentum is also strong, with a high record of 17 points. Liaoning and Tianjin are tied for second with only 5 points each. However, Liaoning has excellent track and field results, and the championship should be contested by Shanghai and Liaoning. (2) Shanghai is undoubtedly guaranteed to win in football. Although Li Huitang is currently ill, it will have absolutely no impact. Except for the Guangdong team, which may be able to resist slightly, the rest cannot withstand a single blow. (3) Shanghai also has a 90% chance of winning in baseball. (4) Hong Kong is the strongest in volleyball. It is unfortunate that the Shanghai team will meet the Hong Kong team in the second week. Guangdong, which has always been the leader in the Far East, is likely to be defeated by the Hong Kong team. (5) The strength of the Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Tianjin teams is average in baseball. The Tianjin team has a very good pitcher. The Shanghai team's head coach has urgently telegraphed Liu Dacheng and Lu Guanxiang yesterday, asking them to take the early train on the 6th to arrive at the conference. If they win the rematch with Tianjin, they will face the Hong Kong team in the final. (6) Shanghai can secure the right to the basketball final. Tianjin and Beiping are both strong, but they must first have a rematch. The winner will then compete with Shanghai for the championship. The chances of both sides are 50/50. (7) In the all-around championship, Shanghai and Liaoning are in a confrontational situation, and the rest are not worth mentioning. (8) Swimming is an upset. Hong Kong and Shanghai are more promising. As for the overall championship, Shanghai is the first choice, followed by Hong Kong, Liaoning, and Guangdong.</p>

<p>At 1 p.m., the Jiangsu and Hubei teams held a volleyball preliminary round. The Jiangsu team had complete talent and was skilled in offense and defense. The second row's pressure ball was particularly effective. The Hubei team had a scattered layout and responded poorly. Not long after the start of the game, Jiangsu's Bao Jialiang scored seven consecutive points on his serve, followed by Zhang Xing with four points, while Hubei only had one point. After changing sides, the Jiangsu team took advantage of the victory to attack, like a broken bamboo. It won the Guangdong Volleyball Team Wang Kai Photo</p>
<p>Won the first game with a score of 21 to 5. In the second game, the Hubei team's offense improved slightly, without adding to the Jiangsu team's first row. The closing door was very fast, and the Lei Pool was difficult to cross. The Jiangsu team initially took the lead with a score of 11 to 3, and then won the second game with a score of 21 to 6. The result was 2 to 0. Referee Qiu Jixiang. The lineups of the two teams are listed below.</p>

<p>Hong Kong Volleyball Team has strong strength and has repeatedly been the leader in South China. It is the most promising team for this volleyball championship. At 3 p.m. on the 2nd, it met Liaoning in the preliminary round. Although Liaoning is strong in the north, it is still a newcomer. To compete with Hong Kong, it is naturally much inferior. Therefore, Hong Kong did not spend much effort. It initially won with a score of 21 to 2, and then defeated Liaoning with a score of 21 to 3, winning two consecutive games.

<p>Preliminary Round Results</p>
<p>Beiping A Wins Against Anhui...2 to 0 Shanghai A Wins Against Beiping...2 to 0 (1) Beiping A Wins Against Anhui</p>
<p>The Beiping women's volleyball team has two teams registered to participate in the competition, so they are distinguished by A and B. At 1 p.m. on the 2nd, Beiping A competed against Anhui. Because the Anhui team did not arrive, it was deemed to have forfeited, and Beiping A won. (2) Shanghai A Wins Against Beiping B Shanghai A volleyball team is completely composed of Shanghai's elite members. The players are mostly veterans and have very deep technical experience. In this conference, they are quite hopeful to win the championship. The Beiping B team has not been established for a long time, and the news of the battle is inevitably negligent. Encountering such a strong enemy in the first battle, because the strength difference is quite different, it is difficult to show off the offense, and it is also powerless to defend. No wonder Shanghai's victory is as easy as turning a hand. The first game was 21 to 1, and the second game was 21 to 2. As a result, Shanghai won 2 to 0. Referee Qian Yiqin.

<h3 id="e138">General Review of the Two-Day Track and Field Competition <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Day Two: Liu Changchun injured his foot, no outstanding performance. Female hero Sun Guiyun moves as if flying.</p>
<p>In the track and field competition on the first day, short-distance prodigy Liu Changchun, except for the 200 meters, had no good results, which greatly disappointed the audience. According to Xiao Dinghua, Liu injured his hamstring severely during training in Shanghai. Fortunately, he received prompt treatment, but it has not fully healed. It is believed that he may recover by the time he goes to the Far East Games. Liu's start in the 100 meters was extremely slow, and he did not exert himself until after 30 meters, hence the poor result. However, Zhou Zhaoyuan and Zhong Lianji worked very hard, and it is expected that the 100-meter final will see fierce competition between Liu, Zhou, and Zhong. In the 400 meters, Liu seemed to deliberately concede, frequently looking back as he approached the finish line, resulting in second place. Liu was very diligent in the 200 meters (Lin Zemin Photo), although the time was quite different than Xiao's previous record of 22.2 seconds, it was still a leading result in the day's events. In the women's track events, the East Special District's results seem to be the best. Female hero Sun Guiyun moves as if flying. At the sound of the gun, the yellow uniform dazzled the eyes, maintaining a distance of more than ten steps from the second-place runner. After the race, she was surrounded by photographers and received a burst of applause.</p>
<p>Wang Yuan's performance was also not bad. There is no doubt that the East Special District will win the track and field championship. Sun is still young, has excellent form, and with diligent training, it will not be difficult to become an international athlete. There were no remarkable results in the high and low hurdles races. In the 1500 meters, the northeastern talents showed their prowess again. Zhao Dexin and Jiang Yunlong secured the first and second positions, respectively, with a "who else but me" attitude in the final. The high jump final was one of the most exciting scenes of yesterday. More than fifty people participated. At 1.689 meters, only Tianjin's Li Zhongsan, Liaoning's Fu Baorui, Beiping's Wu Yunlong, and Shanghai's Su Zuxie jumped over. The rest failed three times. It was especially regrettable that Fu's hand knocked the bar down each time. Shanghai's Su was also able to cope with effort. As a result, the three tied for second place. Then Li jumped over once again, with a height of 1.73 meters, which is still far from the national record. He should practice diligently, otherwise we may not have a place in the Far East Games. In the women's shot put final, the result was 7.845 meters. The national record is 8.33 meters, held by Chen Xinyuan. Unfortunately, Chen was eliminated yesterday due to poor spirits. It is hoped that Chen will strive harder in the coming sessions and regain the championship. Day Two. Men's 100 meters: In yesterday's men's 100-meter semi-finals, short-distance athletes Liu Changchun, Zhong Lianji, and Jiang Peng all took first place. Liu's result was slightly better than the previous day, but his start was still very slow, lagging behind especially around 50 meters. When he reached the finish line, he sprinted hard and surpassed Hao Chunde. Shanghai's Jiang Peng had a very good result in yesterday's race. The famous North China general Zhou Zhaoyuan even retreated to second place. It is expected that there will be fierce competition between Shanghai and Liaoning in the 100-meter final. If Liu Changchun does not achieve a time of within 11 seconds, Zhong and Jiang may compete with him for the top spot.</p>
<p>Men's 200 meters: In the men's 200-meter semi-final, Zhou Ende led at the start of the first group. Liu Changchun's start was still very slow. At around 250 meters, Liu was in second place, swinging his arms and looking up as he chased hard. Unexpectedly, he still won first place at the finish line, which was not easy. However, the result was really not good. In the second group, Tianjin's Zhou Zhaoyuan started before Zhong Lianji, and Zhong also caught up at the finish line. In the final, the two heroes from the north and the south will meet. It is unknown who will win. Men's 800 meters: The results of yesterday's 800-meter heats were not very outstanding. In the first lap of the first group, Liaoning's Lang Dakui and Pang Shirong took the first and second positions in turn. Unexpectedly, in the last half-lap, Jiangsu's Song Ze'an snatched the lead, which was quite surprising. In the second group, Liaoning's Xue Yuxiang also took the lead at the start. Shanghai's Deng Zhiming caught up in the second lap. Although Xue tried hard to chase, he was unable to catch up. It is expected that Liaoning will have difficulty winning the final if they do not make a special effort. Women's 50 meters: In yesterday's women's 50-meter semi-final, Sun Guiyun of the East Special District maintained her original speed and won first place in the first group. In the second group, Wang Yuan, a famous player from the East Special District, started too quickly and committed two fouls. The third time, she inevitably felt apprehensive. She dared to start racing only after the gun was fired and tried hard to catch up, but the distance was too great, and she was unable to recover, which was a great pity. Men's High Hurdles: In yesterday's high hurdles semi-final, Liaoning's Ding Hua maintained the first position. Shanghai's Cao Yu started slower and gradually caught up in the middle section, finishing third. At the start of the second group, Beiping's Wang Yuzhen moved as if flying and took the lead immediately. He broke through past Fujian's Lin Shaozhou at 80 meters and was several steps ahead of Lin at the finish line, showing great promise in the final.</p>
<p>Men's 400 meters: In yesterday's 400-meter semi-final, short-distance prodigy Liu Changchun maintained first place in the second group, but the result was still not good. Guangdong's Mai Guozhen, who took first place in the first group, had a decent result and will compete with Shanghai's Zhu Ruihong for the runner-up spot in the final. Shot Put</p>
<p>In the final of the twelve-pound shot put, 22 athletes competed, but there were no good results. They were all average. Liaoning's Fan Guangwu's third throw reached 13.115 meters. Shanghai's shot put expert Dai Ming achieved 13.10 meters in the second attempt. The rest were all within 13 meters. With the third throw, Dai Ming jumped to the top spot with 13.30 meters. Unexpectedly, Shanghai's Pan Nanshun pushed hard with the sixth throw and won first place with 13.34 meters. Although the result was slightly different from the national record of 14.11 meters, it was far from the Far Eastern record of 14.23 meters. It is hoped that they will work harder so that there is hope.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Women's Baseball Throwing Competition <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The women's baseball throwing final was the best result of yesterday and the focus of the entire venue. Talents gathered, and the differences were extremely small. There were seven or eight people who threw over 33 meters. Guangdong's Chen Peitao threw 38.46 meters in the first throw, and the entire venue applauded. With a swing of her jade arm, the ball flew like an arrow, which was astounding. Second place went to Hunan's Yang Ren, and third place went to Beiping's Hu Ruixiu. Their results were all over 34 meters. Shanghai's Fan Ruimei, who had a result of 38 meters, was eliminated, which was a great pity. Jump.</p>
<p>In the long jump final, Shanghai's Hao Chunde took the lead with 6.01 meters, but the result was not satisfactory. In the daily trials, he jumped more than six meters easily. However, Hao only achieved 6.01 meters to win first place. Guangdong's Situ Guang finished second with a difference of 0.01 meters. The field events seemed to be relatively poor overall, possibly due to the weather. It has been very cold for several days. If it is warmer, the results may be better. Compared to the national record of 6.74 meters and the Far Eastern record of 7.09 meters, the results this time are far behind.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Dai Jitao's Speech <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Seeing the Significance of Sports from Chinese History and Culture</p>
<p>Dai Jitao, President of the National Games, came to Hangzhou this time to preside over the Games. Seeing the enthusiasm of athletes from all over the country and the progress of their physiques, he was very pleased. In addition to a sincere speech at the welcome meeting on the evening of the 1st, he also delivered an important speech, expounding the meaning of sports being connected to politics from the founding basis of China and the political philosophy of past dynasties. The following is a transcript of his speech.</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese citizens have gradually realized the importance of sports. The National Games have been held three times, but this is considered the first time that the central government has initiated and presided over it. My opinion has already been written in the opening speech of the Games, but I still have some thoughts to share with everyone at this time. In recent years, in my study of ancient Chinese history, regarding the composition of the nation and the construction of the country, I have discovered a unique feature that other countries do not have, which is that both in political theory and in policy, sports are the foundation. Ancient history is not recorded in detail, making it quite difficult to know, but compared to other countries, the myths are unreasonable, and China is the best, and the general situation is also very correct. In the Fuxi era, China had writing. Shennong's civil administration and military achievements were both extremely far-reaching. The foundation of a unified national state was laid at this time. By the time of the Yellow Emperor, the composition of a great nation and the construction of a great country were completely successful. Therefore, many Chinese historians highly respect the Yellow Emperor as the first ancestor of the Chinese nation. The foundation of state-building in these two dynasties was very unique. Shennong was an inventor of medicine, and the Yellow Emperor was also a great scholar of medical hygiene. The Nei Jing, which is circulated today, may not be the work of the Yellow Emperor era, but it is certain that the Yellow Emperor's politics were based on medical hygiene as the foundation of all political theory and practice. Over the millennia, what has enabled the Chinese nation to become great is entirely due to this. I have not studied foreign history, but as far as I know, building a country with medicine and hygiene as the foundation of political theory and with medical hygiene as a specialized skill is certainly unprecedented in foreign history. Regarding the Hong Fan in the Book of Documents, whether it is true or not, scholars have different opinions, but what is recorded in this book is sufficient to explain the general political philosophy of the Three Dynasties, at least a kind of political philosophy that records the tradition of the Shang Dynasty, claiming that the purpose of politics is to enable the people to achieve five blessings and eliminate six extremes. The so-called five blessings are: first, longevity; second, wealth; third, health; fourth, love of virtue; fifth, a peaceful death. The six extremes are: first, violent death; second, disease; third, worry; fourth, poverty; fifth, evil; sixth, weakness. From this, it can be seen that the most important thing in the political proposals at that time was health and longevity for the people. Such political theories are indeed great, accurate, and unique to other countries, very practical and very important. Later generations explained the principles of self-cultivation and the methods of governing the country in an increasingly abstract way, and the meaning of morality almost turned into mythology, which is truly lamentable. Until modern times, our Chinese nation's teacher of revival, the founder of the Republic of China, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, was also a medical expert. In his theory of psychological construction, he said that all of human civilization is nothing more than returning to the two words "maintenance." Only by using the natural ability of self-cultivation to resist all diseases can one achieve health. I believe that all of the Premier's doctrines and policies come from this principle. Because I discovered these major events in history, and because I have personally suffered the pain of physical illness and the pain of illness hindering my career and work, I have become more aware of the importance of sports and hygiene. Indeed, all profound and great knowledge requires a strong body and mind to acquire and apply. As for the meaning of morality, I believe that the method of acquiring a strong body and spirit is the Dao, and being able to work hard and unremittingly and help others to do so is Virtue. The method of enabling a group to have a strong organization and doctrine is the Dao, and being able to work hard and unremittingly and help others and other groups to do so is Virtue. Therefore, the meaning of morality is simply connected to sports and hygiene, and sometimes it can even be used as an explanation. Especially the Taoists in China, who specialize in morality, completely regard sports and hygiene as the essence of all morality. Our Chinese nation has reached its extreme point of weakness. The biggest shortcoming is obviously that both body and spirit are weak. In foreign countries, whether it is a politician, a soldier, a scholar, or an industrialist, they are still in their prime at the age of fifty or sixty, and they are only considered old at the age of seventy or eighty. Originally, no matter what kind of career it is, one always has to reach the age of forty or fifty to learn, be able to create independently, and truly have the confidence to teach and the ability to lead. If one dies or declines at the age of forty or fifty, then one has achieved nothing. If a nation as a whole dies or declines at the age of forty or fifty, then the culture of this nation, no matter what, cannot be created. At this moment, to save the Chinese nation in construction, all kinds of careers are certainly important, but to save the essence of the Chinese nation, medicine and sports are two very important things. Medicine is still passive rescue and treatment, which is to save people who are already ill and declining. Only paying attention to sports is a positive and important way to create a strong body that cannot be invaded by all diseases, cannot be harmed by all poisons, and cannot be injured by strong enemies. With this foundation, whatever science or career can be learned well, and what has been learned can be brought into play. I myself am willing to work hard in this way, and I hope that all compatriots across the country will understand this meaning and strive to implement it. Whether it is a school or various groups, especially in various villages, it is necessary to recognize that sports is the only way to save oneself, save others, save the country, and save the world, and to promote it with all efforts. Then sports competitions are a method to achieve the above-mentioned goals, and it is definitely not the meaning of setting up a ring like in China. The reason why sports in China cannot progress is partly due to the savagery of setting up a ring. Therefore, we must know that for those who sincerely work hard and participate in various competitions, the winners and the losers are worthy of everyone's praise and worthy of everyone's commendation, and those who are less skilled and lose are also worthy of everyone's praise and worthy of everyone's respect. It is necessary to eliminate the thinking of setting up a ring in the feudal era, abide by the rules of sports, and respect the morality of sports. Only then can sports become popular and turn into a mass movement. I hope that all the representatives and athletes in various places will fully recognize this point and strive to promote it.</p>

<p>The Liangjiang Women's Normal School has been the center of attention at this National Games. All the students have healthy bodies, so the population is amazing. It is reported that the school is scheduled to perform "Building Patterns" and "Military Training" at the meeting hall on the 7th.</p>

<p>Rushing to Bathe</p>
<p>Bathing is one of the methods of fitness. There are as many as 2,000 athletes at the General Assembly. Since the meeting is far from the city, each dormitory is equipped with bathtubs for cleansing. There are twenty in the women's dormitory and sixty in the men's dormitory, which is not enough to allocate because there are several times more male athletes than female athletes.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Clothing Competing for Freshness <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Among the clothing of the female athletes from various provinces, the most beautiful and sensual are those of Harbin and the Liangjiang Women's Normal School in Shanghai. The Liangjiang Women's Normal School wore white tops and shorts, while Harbin wore short beige Indian silk shirts and black shorts that did not reach the knees. Therefore, it was quite praised by the general public.</p>

<p>The Guangdong male and female athletes are staying at the West Lake Hotel on Hubin Road. The hotel is very elegant, with a large patio originally used for tourists to walk and rest. Now it is used by the male and female athletes as a training ground for playing ball. Every time the sun sets, those who are relaxing on Hubin Road and passing by the gate cannot help but stop to watch. The tourists upstairs and downstairs, reclining on the corridors and steps, with a cup of tea, gaze at the lake and mountains from afar and watch the ball game up close. With a happy mind and body, they feel as if they are in a fairyland. It is truly a blessing to travel.</p>

<p>The General Assembly needs to open more than 300 tables for each meal. Therefore, the dishes that are cooked are difficult to swallow. The rice is either mushy or hard, and the dishes are either bland or salty. Therefore, athletes from all over the country have already expressed their dissatisfaction. Yesterday, three athletes from Tianjin had diarrhea all day long. It is said that it was also a gift from the food. There is no market around the General Assembly. However, since the problem of eating is necessary for everyone, there are many residents near the General Assembly who are running speculative meal packages and restaurants. Because the food inside the General Assembly is too bad, they would rather find food outside. Therefore, these temporary shops are doing very well.</p>

<p>Taking Pictures Adds Expenses</p>
<p>There are countless photographers in the General Assembly, and guests with cameras can be seen everywhere, which invisibly adds countless business opportunities to Kodak.</p>

<p>The reporters, Du Tingxiu and Li Jiyuan, have loud voices. They report in the venue, and their clear voices reverberate far away, creating an echo in the mountains and valleys.</p>

<p>Professor Hong Shen, who directed the production of the film "Afraid of Death" at the Grand Theater, which insulted the Chinese nation and caused serious diplomatic negotiations, was invited by the General Assembly to direct the production of an event film. Mr. Hong has been carrying a camera around the General Assembly these days, rushing back and forth. Although he is sweating profusely, he is tireless. It is said that more than 4,000 frames have been taken in the past two days.</p>

<p>There were no fewer than a hundred photographers at the event. Whenever there was a highlight, they would scramble to capture it. During the Eastern Special Games, female athletes Sun Guiyun and Wu Meixian were physically strong, well-proportioned, and had a graceful demeanor with outstanding results. They earned much praise in the arena, and photographers vied to capture their true likeness. After the women's 100-meter preliminary, the two misses ranked among the top. A Mr. Huang eagerly requested to take photos. The good intention was appreciated, but he did not consider that the thin silk was not warm, and after running, they were sweaty and weak, with the wind chilling them to the bone. Mayor Zhou was very considerate and refused to allow the photos to be taken, instructing them to quickly put on their clothes. Mr. Huang had already prepared everything, but the effort failed, which was a bit of a letdown. He could only blame himself for bad luck.</p>

<p>The event drew a massive crowd. Besides the Boy Scouts maintaining order, police were stationed everywhere to keep order. Thanks are due to the Zhejiang police authorities for their enthusiasm. Yesterday afternoon around 3 p.m., a soldier tried to enter the venue from the main entrance among the crowd. He passed the first gate, but the second gate was difficult to escape. When he broke into the track and field arena, he lingered near the area where a certain girls' school was stationed. The monitors noticed him and ordered him to leave, but he refused. Then five or six policemen came and sternly told him to respect himself in uniform. Seeing that he was outnumbered, the soldier fled with his head in his hands.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, Zhejiang and Liaoning competed in soccer. The Liaoning cheerleaders were on the left side of the grandstand, dressed in black clothes and hats, each holding a small triangular black flag with white characters for "Liaoning." They shouted "Liaoning, Liaoning" incessantly. Many of them had small wooden fish, and when their team kicked to a tense moment, they would beat the wooden fish loudly, the sound resounding throughout the venue.</p>

<p>The day before the opening ceremony, Hangzhou was pouring with rain. The next day, the sun was shining and the wind was gentle, and people were celebrating. But ever since the games began, the spring breeze has been constant and slightly chilly. Although it was spring weather, people felt thinly clad. Some male athletes wore greatcoats, while others wore large blankets. However, the flags hanging in the venue flew in the wind, which was quite beautiful. Some said that this was the athletes' vigorous spirit.</p>
<h3 id="e155">No One Asks About the Ice Cream <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Several concession stands were set up inside the venue, selling various snacks and fruits. Although the prices were high, the business was still good due to the large venue and many people. However, no one asked about the ice cream, as the cool breeze was uninvited.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Isn't This Fate? <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Zhejiang and Liaoning competed in soccer. The Liaoning team included students from Northeastern University and Feng Yong University, who temporarily organized a cheering squad to cheer them on. Seeing their fierce momentum, Zhejiang also hastily organized and intensified their efforts. Most of the spectators were students from major middle schools and universities in Zhejiang, so they joined in. The shouts rose and fell, shaking the sky. But the result was a score of two to one, with Liaoning winning. Some said that Zhejiang had both geographical advantages and popular support, but their failure must be fate.</p>
<h3 id="e157">A Reporter Can't Take It <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Every sports venue has a press box, but most are taken by spectators, making them virtually useless. Yesterday, a reporter occupied a seat in the soccer field early, thinking he was safe. Soon, three or four beautiful young women came and leaned against the wooden railing behind him, their fleshy legs in nude stockings constantly bumping into him. The reporter couldn't take it and, in embarrassment, was afraid of making mistakes in his notes, so he had to give up his seat. Many of his friends laughed at his incompetence, which was also an interesting anecdote.</p>

<p>Lu Shutian, the Zhejiang team's goalkeeper, has a reputation as an "Iron Gate." Yesterday, in the first match against Liaoning, the Zhejiang team's ball control was good. Several times the goal was in danger, but Lu was able to handle it calmly. The most dangerous time, the ball was already by the goal, but Lu calmly kicked it out with one foot, thus escaping the dangerous situation. Therefore, the whole stadium cheered loudly.</p>

<p>Zhong Lianji was not known as an athlete when he was at Fudan University. But after transferring to Jinan University, his talents emerged daily, and his performance improved rapidly. Jinan University is a school where overseas athletes return to China for training. Its soccer and track and field teams are outstanding and famous throughout the country. Perhaps Lianji's achievements were inspired by his environment, so his future potential is immeasurable. This time, representing Shanghai in the 100-meter preliminary, he has already won the top spot. It is predicted that he will be able to secure victory in the final and bring glory to Shanghai. Keep trying!</p>

<p>Held on the 18th of this month The Chinese Boy Scouts have been established for almost a year. Now, in order to examine the results of their past training, it has been decided to convene in Nanjing from the 18th of this month to hold the first grand review and practice various military drills. The headquarters of the army has notified the Boy Scouts in various places to arrive in Beijing on schedule. The various things heard are published as follows. Collection The first national general review and grand camping of the Chinese Boy Scouts was decided a month ago, and it will be held in Nanjing on April 18. Now that the deadline is approaching, the commander-in-chief's office has sent personnel to the Ministry of Communications to discuss free travel for Boy Scouts to and from various places. Minister Wang Boqun of the Ministry of Communications agreed. Now it has been presented to the Ministry, saying that the significance of this national Boy Scout review is to assess the results of the year and make universal improvements in the future, so that the young children of the whole country can be trained to truly believe in the Three Principles of the People and be successors to the national revolution. It is an unprecedented initiative and a special situation, not other matters of regret that can be used as precedents. Considering that all countries in the world provide free travel on trains and ships for Boy Scouts traveling domestically on weekdays.</p>
<p>The Boy Scouts have been issued a specific free pass by the commander-in-chief's office, which is valid until the 18th of this month, and they must gather in the capital.

<h3 id="e166">The Ministry of Education Approves the Flexible Measures for Examining and Approving Textbooks <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to the difficulties reported by the Zhonghua Book Company in deleting the general title, requested approval for flexible measures, and submitted sample pages of the New Zhonghua New Primary School Chinese Language Reader for approval. All departments have now approved it and ordered the education administrative organs of all provinces and cities to instruct all bookstores to comply. The previous regulations of the Ministry regarding the matters to be marked on the cover of various textbooks, including six consolidation measures, and the deletion of general titles such as New Era and New Doctrine, have been issued to all bookstores for compliance and correction. Subsequently, the Shanghai Bookstore Association submitted a statement stating that the deletion of the general title was difficult and requested appropriate flexible measures. The Ministry rejected this and reiterated the previous order to all bookstores for compliance and not to delay in the slightest. Now, the Shanghai Zhonghua Book Company has reported that the cancellation of the words "New Zhonghua" and "New Primary School" will make it easy for the names of various bookstores to be confused, and it will be difficult for purchasers to identify them. They requested a review and instructions for compliance and attached two sample pages of the New Zhonghua Chinese Language Reader and the New Primary School Chinese Language Reader. The Ministry previously stated that the various textbooks published by various bookstores often have the same specific general title above the names of the various books, as a set. The name is cumbersome, and it is doubtful whether the editing has a complete plan and whether the content has a clear and practical connection. Moreover, the quality of teaching materials varies, and some books in the same set have been approved by the Ministry, while others have not. Therefore, although the name is a set, many are incomplete. The specific general title that makes up a set has long lost its effect, so it has been repeatedly ordered to be deleted to be consistent with the name. Now, the bookstore has repeatedly reported the difficulties of the bookstore and purchasers, and has changed the New Zhonghua Textbook and New Primary School Textbook to the three words "New Zhonghua New Primary School", which are listed at the top of the book name and combined into one line. The name "Textbook" has been changed to "Textbook", called "New Zhonghua XX Textbook" and "New Primary School XX Textbook". The name is relatively simple and easy to identify. It is also reasonable that it is easy to confuse in each bureau and that purchasers have difficulty in identifying each situation. A temporary flexible measure is allowed. The New Zhonghua Chinese Language Textbook and New Primary School Chinese Language Textbook names submitted by the Association should be approved for adoption. However, the names of subsequent textbooks should be simplified as much as possible to be clear and appropriate, and submitted to the Ministry for approval at any time to achieve uniformity. In addition to *</p>

Yesterday, they sent personnel to both the north and south markets to find out that the rice boats arriving at the port were still enthusiastic and had greatly increased compared with a few days ago. In this situation, the rice market should ease. However, most of the rice boats that arrived are stored under the river and not sold.

The Order No. 572 of the Order of Examination is re-examined and sent to the hospital for compliance and transfer for compliance, this order. It is also declared that the Committee of Examination of Lawyers has issued Order No. 572, stating that the chairman of the Committee of Examination of Lawyers, Xie Yingzhou, has submitted a report for advice. At the 73rd meeting on March 4 of this year, the committee discussed the case of applicants for examination who must attach photos in the future for identification and easy reference. It was decided that all applicants for examination or those who apply for a lawyer's license must attach two recent two-and-a-half-inch photos in addition to submitting proof of qualification documents and fees in accordance with the regulations. One copy will be kept by the department for future reference, and one copy will be attached to the lawyer's license. When registering with the higher court of each province, two or three photos should also be submitted (two for those who execute duties in a local court, and three for those who execute duties in two local courts). One photo will be attached to the lawyer's register, and the rest will be sent by the higher court to the local court designated to execute the duties of a lawyer for future reference. If the registrant is holding a lawyer's license previously obtained, four or five photos should be added (four for those who execute duties in a local court, and five for those who execute duties in two local courts) and submitted to the higher court for attachment, storage, and presentation. A courtyard seal should be added to all places where photos are attached to the lawyer's license. All those who have a lawyer's license and have already registered must add photos in accordance with the above regulations within three months from the date of announcement of the higher court of each province, and present them to the higher court of each province for separate processing. Those who have not registered should also add two photos within the time limit and submit them to the Ministry or present them to the higher court for verification, etc. In this regard, it is found that the proposed methods are still feasible, except</p>
<p>In addition to notifying and announcing, it is urgently ordered that the hospital comply, and to record the order and notify everyone and transfer it to the Lawyers Association of each province for compliance, this order. In this regard, the announcement is urgently notified to everyone.</p>

After more than a year of efforts, the entire treaty has been fully negotiated, but because of the successive changes in the French cabinet, the French ambassador has not yet been instructed to come to Beijing to sign it. Zhang has repeatedly received telegrams from Long Yun, the chairman of the provincial government, urging him to return, and it is difficult to wait any longer. Therefore, he decided to return to Guizhou. Before that, he telegraphed Chairman Chiang to ask for instructions. Chiang replied and ordered him to go to Beijing to meet him before leaving Shanghai.

<h3 id="e181">Further Records on Chinese Merchants Maintaining Yangtze River Transportation <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Seagoing Vessels Responding to Emergency After the suspension of 14 Chinese Yangtze River vessels, the local shipping companies were quite anxious, as Shanghai had a large backlog of goods waiting to be shipped out. Currently, only China Merchants' Jiangxin, Jianghua, and Jiangshun can be launched to Shanghai to operate as usual. However, there are many goods and few ships, which is not enough to meet the demand. Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau's meeting resulted in the temporary use of the Taishun, a seagoing vessel returning from Guangdong, to respond to the emergency. It was decided to dispatch it to the Yangtze River today to load passengers and goods. At the same time, the headquarters was telegraphed to instruct all ports along the way not to hinder the vessel in order to maintain transportation. Ningbo-Shaoxing Purchase of Ships In order to save the Yangtze River navigation rights and resist foreign merchants' monopoly, the Ningbo-Shaoxing Shipping Company specifically entrusted Da Feng Yangxing to purchase 2,400 tons</p>
<p>of steamships from Hong Kong Nuowei shipping companies. This ship was built in 1915, although it is a seagoing vessel, its draft and other aspects are quite suitable for Yangtze River navigation, so it was decided to purchase</p>
<p>it to expand Yangtze River voyages. The ship price is fourteen thousand</p>
<p>pounds, which is equivalent to more than 190,000 Shanghai dollars. It was heard yesterday that the contract has been signed and the transaction has been completed, and the ship will be delivered immediately. The ship's name is "Immed</p>
<p>Love", and it is expected to arrive in Shanghai within a week. After some repairs, it can be dispatched to Shanghai-Hankou. The new ship name has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Revised Package Price China Merchants Bureau's Yangtze River ships have recently seen an increase in passengers. The bureau plans to increase the passenger package price for each ship. The business section has drafted a proposal to increase the monthly passenger package price for large ships departing on Mondays and Thursdays to 2,800 yuan, and the monthly passenger package price for mid-level ships departing on the 3rd and 6th to 2,700 yuan. In case of minor ship groundings or damage, and transportation of soldiers, etc., with short deadlines, the bureau may, at its discretion, subsidize 15%. In case of damage, suspension of navigation, and other major circumstances, further discussion will be held. A notice has been sent to all business directors yesterday. Zhengzhou Goods Interrupted Every year in April and May, goods from Zhengzhou are extremely crowded, and they are all loaded by the Yangtze River to Shanghai and then transferred to</p>
<p>overseas vessels to European countries. Peanuts, soybeans, cotton and other goods are the best. Recently, due to the changing situation, the arrival of goods from Zhengzhou has been interrupted. Not only has the downstream business of the Yangtze River vessels been sharply reduced, but also the export of European ships has been affected. According to news from foreign shipping companies yesterday, a large number of peanuts and other goods have been blocked and cannot be loaded on ships to the east.</p>

<p>The students studying in the United States appointed by the Central Party Department, who had previously booked tickets and handled all travel procedures through the China Travel Service, set sail from Shanghai on the Changxing Russian Queen liner on February 15.

A grand welcoming banquet was held in the evening, attended by members of Congress, overseas branches of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Chinese Association, the General Chamber of Commerce, and representatives from various Chinese organizations. The atmosphere was lively and speeches were given, and the evening ended in joy.</p>
<p>It was also heard that the students were extremely satisfied with the trip, and when reporting to the National Government, they planned to suggest that new</p>
<p>students in the future could take the Queen liner of the Changxing Company, which is large and fast, and can save various procedures.</p>
<h3 id="e183">The Commercial Press Employees' Union Protests the Foreign Soldiers' Homicide <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>At about 7 pm on March 30, outside the Chang'e Dance Hall on Tianzhutang Street, foreign sailors stabbed pedestrians with knives, injuring Song Derong, an employee of the Commercial Press, Zhou Fugen, the owner of a Chinese barber shop, and three other unidentified persons. The Commercial Press Employees' Union proposed opinions and methods for handling this case, divided into short-term and long-term solutions, and requested guidance and assistance from various sectors of society to fight together. The following is a transcript of its telegram to the Municipal Party Department: Submitting the plea for a French soldier to commit a wanton murder, harm compatriots, and implore the government to immediately lodge a serious protest to protect the people's lives and maintain national rights. Your Association member Song Derong, Cui Zhiliang, and Shi Huitang were coming from the office on official matters at about 7 pm on March 30, passing by the Chang'e Dance Hall in Tianzhutang Street, when a French sailor suddenly stabbed Song in the left side of his back with a bayonet. Song fainted and fell to the ground. Cui Zhiliang and Shi Huitang, seeing the sailor coming fiercely, were shocked and ran wildly, while whistling and shouting for help. They were finally tracked down and arrested by a Chinese police officer and sent to the Dabai Mingzhong French Police Station for detention. At the same time, two Chinese police officers, No. 392 and No. 496, inspected the scene and sent the injured Song Derong to Renji Hospital for treatment. His injuries were serious. Afterwards, it was learned that a few minutes before Song was stabbed, Zhou Fugen, the owner of a Chinese barber shop (also on Tianzhutang Street), and a certain person A (name unknown) were also stabbed by the sailor. Zhou's injuries were minor (the knife stabbed about an inch deep in his chest and ribs), while the injuries of Person A were the most serious and it is still unknown where he is being treated. At a time when there are loud calls to abolish unequal treaties, foreigners are still using concessions as a shield and extraterritoriality as a guarantee, daring to commit wanton murders in our Chinese territory. It is a disregard for international etiquette, trampling on human rights, people are the knives, and we are the fish. There have been countless compatriots who have groaned and died miserably under the iron hooves of imperialism. Recently, Zhang Xueliang's blood has not yet dried, and the tragedy on Tianzhutang Street has occurred again. This can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Therefore, we appeal to the government to immediately lodge a serious protest and achieve the following goals: (1) Short-term solutions: There are three direct requirements regarding this case: 1. The French government should apologize to the Chinese government and guarantee that French citizens will not commit similar acts of violence in the future. 2. The sailor who committed the murder should be punished by Chinese law. 3. The damages and reputation of Song Derong, Zhou Fugen, and others should be compensated with 60,000 taels of silver. (2) Long-term solutions: There are two requirements from the principle of safeguarding national sovereignty: 1. Withdraw the naval and ground forces of all countries stationed in China. 2. Unite the power of the people to recover the concessions. All members of the association, while we still have breath, will fight to the death, rather be jade than tile. In submitting this plea, we cannot express our impatience for orders. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>To Discuss Supporting the Pharmaceutical Workers' Strike The pharmaceutical workers in this city have demanded job placement for the unemployed, which has been rejected by the capitalists, resulting in a strike. For more than ten days, there has been no hope of resolution. The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in view of the fact that the lives of pharmaceutical workers may be cut off if this continues, and in response to the request of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, decided to convene a meeting of all trade unions in the city at 1:00 pm today in the assembly hall of the union to discuss all assistance matters. It is reported that the association has issued Order No. 13, requiring each trade union to send two representatives to attend, and instructing the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union to send personnel to report on the progress of the strike at the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Additional Surcharges on Merchant Ships <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Disaster Relief Due to the disaster in Zhejiang last year, it was agreed upon by the provincial authorities and the Relief Committee that all freight and passenger fares on all ships traveling in Zhejiang, regardless of coastal inland rivers, would be subject to a 10% surcharge for disaster relief. It was initially scheduled to take effect on March 15 for a period of one year, but later, at the request of the shipping companies in Shanghai, it was postponed to April 1. All Chinese and foreign merchant ships, gasoline ships, and deck boats will be subject to the surcharge. The donation will be collected by personnel sent by the managing agency at the ship's destination, who will inspect the books and collect the tax according to the amount of business. Those who conceal or fail to report will be severely punished. Due to package confirmation issues, the Shanghai-Ningbo ships in this city are still under negotiation,</p>
<p>so the implementation is slightly later than other ships. Chongming Sand Dam Donation There are a total of six companies operating the Shanghai-Chongming-Haimen ferries. Currently, the Chongming-Haimen waterway must be dredged in order to allow for smooth navigation. The two county chiefs of Chongming and Haimen have agreed that the first step in dredging the river is to start with building a dam, which requires a total of 4,000 yuan. They have discussed with six shipping companies in Shanghai, including Daxing, to recognize and borrow 4,000 yuan for the project. In the future, surcharges will be collected on each ship ticket to repay the loan. The six companies have met several times and agreed to comply.</p>

<p>Held at Renji Hall Yesterday</p>
<p>Hunan Province has suffered particularly severe disasters in recent years, surpassing all other provinces. Although the people of the province have made every effort to save themselves, the disaster is too great and their power is too small to cope with it. Moreover, due to the slow pace of external publicity, the outside world is largely unaware of the actual situation of the Hunan disaster. Now, the province has been suffering from years of famine, and the spring famine is particularly urgent. The province has exhausted all resources. As a last resort, they have publicly elected Mr. Shu Jingxiang to go to Beijing and Shanghai to beg for donations. In addition to visiting the chairman of the Relief Committee and various ministries in Beijing and raising a considerable amount of funds, he recently came to Shanghai with fellow villagers from Beijing, including Qiu Ao, Chen Yu, Ma Zhenwu, Shu Chushi, Tang San, etc., to discuss with Xu Junren, chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, and Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Tan Zuan, Yi Yincun, and the Shanghai gentry from the province, Yu Yaoqu, Wang Songnian, Zeng Nongran, Nie Yuntai, Nie Lusheng, Tan Pingzhai, etc., at the Yunnan Road Renji Hall, and sent invitations to people from all walks of life in Shanghai to gather and raise funds. A total of more than eighty people attended, and Xu Junren was publicly elected as chairman. First, the chairman gave an opening speech, followed by Qiu Ao, who gave a detailed account of the disaster situation and the process of handling relief affairs. It was agreed to publicly elect all the people present as initiators to take charge of raising funds in different ways to benefit the disaster victims, and more than 10,000 yuan was raised on the spot.</p>

<p>Each industry can set its own rules. Explanation from the Business Consolidation Council.</p>
<p>Regarding the regulations on membership fees in the articles of association of trade associations, the Business Consolidation Council sent a letter to the Chicken and Duck Trade Association, stating, "In reply, your letter dated the 27th of this month was received, stating that the articles of association of trade associations established by our council do not specify the membership fee, and the maximum amount that can be charged is unknown. Please give instructions to follow." According to Article 12 of the Implementing Rules of the Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations: "The expenses of the association shall be borne by the members, and the method of sharing shall be decided by the members' representatives congress." Therefore, the maximum amount of this membership fee can be determined as appropriate, and then submitted to the members' representatives congress of the association for decision, and then added to the articles of association of the association. The articles of association of trade associations issued by our council are originally common regulations based on the general situation of various industries, for the use of the blueprint of each association.

<p>Returning Home by Chartered Car in the Evening. Sudden Kidnappers Block the Way. The Old Man Was Weak and Could Not Resist. The Bandit's Car Was Rented and Robbed.</p>
<p>Yang Qinxue, from Nanxiang, runs the Yutai Bean and Wheat Shop at No. 63, Fen Lane, Jiuhua Road, Nanshi. At about 7 p.m. last night, he was kidnapped by bandits while returning home from the shop in his own chartered car. The bandits were both holding pistols. Their car was No. 1483, rented from the Weihai Automobile Shop at No. 902, Weihaiwei Road. After tying Yang into the car, they sped away south from Xiaojiuhua Road. The police officer at the post of the First District and Third Precinct Public Security Bureau caught a glimpse of the car number and reported it to the station for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Old and Weak, Kidnapped into the Car <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Yang Qinxue is 63 years old this year. He goes to and from the shop twice a day in his own chartered car. The driver, Lu Laowu, has been working for many years. Yesterday morning at about 10 a.m., Lu pulled the car to the Yutai Shop. At about 7 p.m., he left the shop to return home. When he reached Xiaojiuhua Road, suddenly two men came forward and stopped the chartered car. The comers were wearing black robes, about 30 years old, and spoke with a Shanghai accent. One of them was wearing a felt hat. After stopping the car, he said to Yang, "Don't make a sound," and showed him a gun. Because Yang was old and weak, he was unable to resist and let them do what they wanted. One bandit threw down the car pole with force, and Yang was immediately kidnapped and boarded a car that had been parked on the roadside, and sped away. The location of the incident was sparsely populated, and no one noticed it at night. However, the chartered car driver, Lu A'wu, seemed to see a young woman sitting in the bandit's car, perhaps as a disguise. The bandit's car sped away towards Xiaonanmen. Because the speed of the car was abnormal, it was noticed by the police officer at the post of the First District and Third Precinct Public Security Bureau near the Social Affairs Bureau. He caught a glimpse of the number 1483. He wanted to stop it, but it was too late. Like an arrow leaving the bow, he watched it go away.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Bandit's Car Rented and Robbed <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The car No. 1483 used by the bandits was rented from the Weihai Automobile Shop at No. 902, Weihaiwei Road, in the Public Concession beforehand. At that time, at about 6:50 p.m., a middle-aged man came to the Weihai Automobile Shop, wearing a black robe, a felt hat, and speaking with a local accent. He claimed to be surnamed Zhang and lived at No. 87, Mendland Road. He wanted to rent a car to pick up his mother-in-law for dinner. The accountant ordered the driver, Xi Linfu, to drive the open car No. 1483 to respond to the guest and drive straight to the Great West Road in Huxi. When he reached the intersection of Avenue Joffre, the person in the car suddenly ordered the driver to stop. At that time, an accomplice had been ambushed on the roadside. He took out a gun and forced Xi Linfu to get out of the car. Xi had no way to resist and obeyed. The bandits jumped into the car and drove away. The driver went to a Westerner's house at No. 7, Avenue Joffre, to borrow a telephone to notify the car shop, and reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Western and Chinese detectives were immediately dispatched to investigate in all directions. After the bandits robbed the car, they drove to Nanshi and kidnapped Yang Qinxue.</p>

<p>Special Team Checks Pedestrians. A Bandit Opens Fire. Japanese Detective Short Stature, Lucky to Survive. In the Pool of Blood, the Thug Loses His Life. At 7:30 p.m. last night, between Xinzha Road and Carter Road, two Japanese patrol officers and two Chinese patrol officers from the Gordon Road Police Station departed to check pedestrians. A man, about 30 years old, wearing a black robe and a copper basin hat, was told to retreat. The Japanese patrol officer of the team thought that the car was too close and wanted to go back, and that the person in the car looked flustered, knowing that he was not a good person, so he went forward to check. Unexpectedly, as soon as the Japanese officer approached him, the man took out a pistol from his sleeve and shot the officer in the chest. Fortunately, the Japanese officer had a bulletproof vest, so the bullet flew over and sparks burst. The officer immediately fought back, but also missed. At this time, the patrol officer who came to check with him saw that the bandit was so bold and immediately went forward to help capture him. The bandit opened fire on the Japanese officer again. Because the Japanese officer was short, the bullet grazed his shoulder. The four patrol officers had no choice but to take out their guns and shoot the bandit head-on. For a time, gunfire rained down and pedestrians disappeared. The bandit retreated while firing. The patrol officers tried their best to chase forward. Later, because the bandit's bullets were exhausted, he fled to the corner of the Xinzha Road Small Vegetable Market, onto the door of the Xinchang Electric Material Shop, and was shot in the shoulder by the patrol officers. The bullet passed through and blood flowed profusely. Still wanting to muster his remaining courage, he fled west. The Japanese officer fired another shot, hitting the bandit in the waist. The bullet entered the abdomen and he immediately fell to the ground. After a while, he died. Later, the police officer at the post telegraphed the police station in charge and dispatched two police cars to search the surrounding alleys for accomplices. As a result, nothing was found. The body was transported to the Filun Road Coroner's Office for an autopsy. It is scheduled to be autopsied this morning.</p>

<p>Woman Died After Hearing the Alarm. Shooting a Little Later, the Child Would Not Have Survived.</p>
<p>The case of the madman Zhang Jiazhen killing a woman and a child with a knife on Zhonghua Road outside Xiaonanmen has been reported three times in this newspaper. It is now learned that prosecutor Yang of the local court, in order to understand the facts of the case and whether it was true madness, in addition to going to the hospital to ask for a detailed confession, yesterday summoned Kang Zhendong, the police officer at the Xiaozha Bridge Police Station of the First District and Third Precinct, who arrested Zhang Jiazhen at the time, to the case for preliminary hearing. When asked about the situation at the time, Kang replied, "At about 1 p.m., I was on duty in front of the Social Affairs Bureau and saw two women passing by with panicked expressions. When I asked them, they said that someone was killing people on the road. I loaded my gun and moved forward and saw a person holding a knife and killing a big child. At that time, Wu Zhou had already died. I shouted, but he was not afraid, so I fired a shot into the sky, but he was still not afraid, and the second knife was already down. Seeing the urgency of the situation, I fired a shot at his leg, hitting his left leg. Unexpectedly, he did not feel any pain, and the third knife was already down, and the child died. He then held a knife and killed a younger child. The child dodged and injured the child's hand. I fired another shot and hit his right foot. Unexpectedly, after being hit, he turned around and saw me, and then held a knife to kill me. I had no choice but to fire another shot, hitting his abdomen, and he fell to the ground." The official asked, "Do you know how to kill the woman?" He replied, "Afterwards, I heard people say that the madman was dancing wildly on the road with a knife and bumped into the woman. The woman scolded him for bumping into people, and the madman killed the woman." Asked, "How did the patrol officer Li Jieshan get injured?" He replied, "Because he heard the gunshot and came to help me, he was hit in the foot by a stray bullet, but it did not hinder him." Asked, "What did he say when he was arrested?" He replied, "When I saw the madman fall and arrested him, I asked him why he killed people. He said that God told me to kill, for the sake of inequality, and said, 'Quickly kill me, I have already killed people.'" The official asked, "If you were faster, you could have saved one of the children who was killed." He replied, "I couldn't be faster. If I was a little slower, another child would have died." After Yang recorded the confession, he ordered him to leave, and after the madman recovered, he would submit a proposal for interrogation again.</p>

<p>Poor Chinese. Ancient Morality is Admirable.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that among the world tour ships this time, there was Douglas, the managing editor of the Toronto Daily News in Canada. He hired a rickshaw at the New Customs Wharf to take a small tour of Shanghai and went to the Astor House Hotel. After entering the room for a few minutes, he suddenly remembered that his small leather suitcase was left in the car. He rushed out to look for it, but the car was nowhere to be found. The suitcase contained important documents, travel checks worth more than 750 yuan, and other valuables. He thought that he would never be able to get it back. However, three hours later, Mr. Douglas came out because of something and was surprised to see that the rickshaw puller was waiting on the opposite side of the road with the leather suitcase still in the car. As soon as he saw Mr. Douglas, he quickly returned the leather suitcase. According to him, he had originally planned to send the leather suitcase to the hotel immediately, but because countless cars came, he had to pull the car to avoid them. Mr. Douglas generously rewarded him and left. This rickshaw puller is also rare in Shanghai recently.</p>

<p>Blackmailers are Related to Kidnappers. Demand 500 Yuan to be Placed in a Letter Box.</p>
<p>Caught While Reaching for It. Hu Chaosheng, who lives at No. 358, Park Road, is now the head waiter at the Waibaidu Bridge Hotel. Hu has a son, Guan Xiong, who is nine years old and studies at the nearby Wushi School. At 4:15 p.m. on the 24th of last month, when he was returning home from school, he was met by several kidnappers, each holding a pistol, who took Guan Xiong away and hid him. They sent a letter to Hu Chaosheng, demanding 4,000 yuan for ransom. After losing his child, Hu reported to the police station, requesting an investigation. It was not until the 28th of last month that Zhao Shuyun, a female investigator at the General Inspection Office of the General Police Station, found out that the kidnappers in the case had decided to negotiate with Hu on Peng Road that day. She disguised herself with Chinese detective Feng Baishun, Western and Chinese detectives Jin Yangwu, Ma Xiaozhi, Feng Shuofu, Cai Zhitian, and Bai Deng and first went to Peng Road. Later, Yongren Chen Kangsheng and local Zhu Guoliang (also known as Li Fusheng) were arrested and taken to the police station. After interrogation, it was learned that the kidnapped child Hu Guanxiong was hidden in Room 45, Daxin Pie House, Fuzhou Road. Western and Chinese detectives immediately rushed there, rescued the child Hu, and also captured Su Ren, who was guarding the child, Qian Yiqing (also known as Wang A'sheng). Xu Chuan asked Hu Chaosheng to take his child back first. Chen and the other three bandits were all taken into custody. Unexpectedly, the day before, Hu suddenly received an anonymous threatening letter, demanding 500 yuan and limiting him to send the money to the letter box hanging on the telegraph pole in front of the Beijing Apartment, Pubo Road, French Concession, at 9 p.m. that night. The person sending the money must hold an umbrella, put the money into the letter box, and leave immediately. If he did not do so, he would take some kind of action against him. Hu submitted the letter to the police station, which ordered detective Ma and Western detective Bai Deng to go to the French police station and dispatch more detectives. At 8 p.m. that night, they rushed to Pubo Road and guarded until 9:30 p.m., when they saw a person coming. He reached into the letter box to grope and was arrested by the detectives. He confessed his name as Shi Maojian, from Chongming. The police station recognized him as being affiliated with the three kidnappers who had been captured before, so he was sent to the Special District Local Court yesterday morning, along with the others, and interrogated briefly by Judge Feng Shide. Because an investigation was needed, he ordered him to be detained until the adjourned date of April 10 for trial.</p>

<p>In order to rectify water transportation, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities started registering and inspecting cargo ships on November 1, 1929. It was originally scheduled to end at the end of January 1930. Later, because there were too many ships and the work could not be completed, the deadline was extended to March 31. According to statistics, a total of 10,210 cargo ships were registered before and after. Now that the deadline has expired, those who have not registered and drive privately in the urban area will be punished in accordance with the regulations as a warning.

<p>Hidden to Limit Speculation. In the Shanghai rice market, japonica rice has always been the most numerous in sales, and foreign indica rice has very little sales. However, recently, rice prices have gradually increased. The price of high-quality japonica rice has increased to as much as 20 yuan. The source is not large. Fortunately, foreign rice is used for sales, but the price is also gradually increasing. Generally, speculators take advantage of the current spring season, and the market price is rising step by step. If it reaches the summer season, when the old and new crops are not yet harvested, the price will definitely increase again, so they are buying up in the market, especially futures, resulting in limited spot foreign rice transactions in the market recently, and futures exceeding spot by several times. Last week, the price of japonica rice soared to 21 yuan, causing panic. Foreign rice transactions are unusually prosperous. The market transactions are all futures, with 60,000 to 70,000 or 40,000 to 50,000 transactions per day. Therefore, the market is becoming more and more urgent. It is heard that people outside the industry have also inserted themselves into the operation. The Chinese Grain Association, due to the increasingly rising market, which is detrimental to people's food, Chairman Ye Huijun and other leaders discussed and decided that, in order to protect the credit of the industry, from</p>

<p>April 1, the buyer and seller of foreign rice futures transactions each pay a security deposit of 1,000 taels per 100 tons to consolidate. After this method was determined, the trading of foreign rice futures in the market on the day before yesterday suddenly became clear. It is necessary to have a security deposit before buying and selling, so the general brokers are preparing to sell the previously booked futures rice, so the market is slightly stagnant. It is also heard that the price of foreign rice privately operated by industry colleagues and friends was previously marked with a seal. Now, each line manager has cracked down on it and issued a bulletin stating that if any friends in the line privately operate foreign rice without entering the accounts, the line will not be responsible, and the friends will be responsible for solving it themselves. It is thought that the market will not be firm and tight again in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Verdict in the Case of Firearms Hidden in Cement Pillars <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Han Changmao Sentenced to Two Months' Imprisonment. Firearms were hidden in cement pillars in the warehouse of Guanji Coal Shop, Dongyouheng Road. On the 23rd of last month, a pillar cracked, revealing a Mauser pistol and bullets. The shop owner, Han Changmao, transferred it to a pile of bricks. The Harbin Police Station searched and seized it, and detained the shop owner and the stacker Li Changsheng, as well as the rickshaw puller Wang Sanzi, who had been a detective Yao A'sheng before he was removed from office, and sent them to the Provisional Court. According to Han's confession, the stone pillar was deposited by Yao in the past. Judge Xu instructed to adjourn the hearing. As reported earlier, Judge Xu continued the hearing again yesterday afternoon. First, the Chinese and Western detectives reported that they had broken all the remaining cement pillars and checked them and found no firearms. Then, Han Changmao's brother, Han Changshan, testified that the stone pillars were deposited by Yao A'sheng in the first month of the previous year, who asked someone to bring them by car. At that time, he only said that they would be stored temporarily for two or three days, and he did not know that firearms were hidden inside. He had never come to pick them up. The defendant Li Changsheng confessed that the pillar in which firearms were found was ordered to be broken by Han Changmao. Wang Sanzi confessed that Yao A'sheng ordered him to send the nine stone pillars to the coal shop for deposit. At that time, Yao was still a detective, so I was inconvenient to report it. Han Changmao's confession was vague, and he hired a lawyer to defend him. After the interrogation, Judge Xu sentenced Han Changmao to two months' imprisonment and confiscated the firearms.</p>
<p>Li and Wang were acquitted. Chief Prosecutor Zhou Xianjue also attended the court and sat with Judge Xu to perform his prosecutorial duties during the trial.</p>

<p>Director Yuan Has Selected Someone</p>
<p>Municipal Public Security Bureau Director Yuan has been considering candidates for the detective squad leader position vacated by Qiao Songsheng's illness and death. In recent days, recommendations for the position have flooded in from various quarters. Yesterday, someone inquired about the situation, and Director Yuan stated that Squad Leader Qiao had served him for ten months, solving numerous major cases and proving a valuable assistant. His unfortunate demise is deeply regrettable. In recent days, recommendation letters for the squad leader position have arrived in an almost blizzard-like fashion, which he found rather pointless. It should be known that the position of squad leader is of utmost importance to the security of this city, and only someone with excellent academic qualifications, experience, and character can fill it. He has already selected someone and is in the process of submitting the request. Until the approval is granted, Deputy Squad Leader Lu will continue to act as temporary agent.</p>

<p>Deadline is April 30th</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has been processing the second phase of industrial and commercial registration since February 1st, originally limited to two months, ending on March 31st. It is now heard that industries such as South Goods and Coal, due to the hurried timeframe, were unable to complete the registration within the deadline. Representatives were sent to the Bureau to earnestly request an extension. After investigation, the Bureau found that the respective trade associations are in the process of reorganization, and therefore granted a one-month extension, with the deadline now set for April 30th. All households belonging to industries included in the second phase of registration, such as bathhouses, barbershops, quail farms, South Goods businesses, Western clothing tailors, bookstores, cloth merchants, etc., that have not yet registered, may also request registration with the Bureau. No further extensions will be granted after the deadline. It is also heard that for those in the first phase of registration such as old goods businesses, sauce gardens, coal businesses, printing businesses, silk and satin businesses, weights and measures businesses, etc., a small number of those who have exceeded the deadline, the Bureau has already sent letters to the Public Security Bureau to instruct the district offices to punish them in accordance with Article 8 of the Industrial and Commercial Registration Regulations, and to order them to register.</p>

<p>Enticed by a Relative of the Second Landlord</p>
<p>Wife Claims Husband's Family is Penniless</p>
<p>Zhang, the wife of Dong Liangming, a Ningbo native residing at No. 434 Beiler Road in the French Concession, secretly ran away on February 12th of this year, disappearing without a trace. Dong searched everywhere without success, until recently, when Dong received an anonymous letter stating that his wife had been abducted by Xi A-wu, a relative of the second landlord. Dong immediately took the letter to the police station, ordering detectives to go to Pudong, where they apprehended Xi and Zhang and brought them back to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought to the French court for investigation. The plaintiff first presented the previous events and hired a lawyer who stated that the defendant, Xi A-wu, had committed the crime of enticement and requested that he be punished according to law and that the embezzled sum of 240 yuan and clothing be recovered. Xi confessed that Zhang had been frequently beaten by her husband, so she went out and asked people to escort her to her relative's home, and he did not dare to entice her. Zhang's confession was similar, and she also stated that her husband was very poor, his family being penniless. How could there be silver dollars and clothing embezzled? She requested an investigation. The judge ordered the two defendants to post bail and await further investigation.</p>

<p>The Sixth District Public Security Bureau of Shanghai West recently apprehended a female abductor named Wu Ma-shi. According to her confession, on January 22nd, she enticed Shi Ding-shi's nine-year-old daughter, A-mei, and sold her to Chen Lu-shi, a resident of No. 112 Wuding Road, for 400 yuan. Since Chen Lu-shi's residence is within the concession, the Bureau dispatched patrol leader Wang Zhentang to the Gordon Road police station the day before, requesting additional detectives to arrest Chen Lu-shi and her fourteen-year-old adopted daughter, Chunlan. Yesterday, they were brought to the Special District Local Court for investigation. Patrol leader Wang presented an official letter requesting a transfer. However, the police lawyer Ru Bao-yi appeared in court and stated that for all cases transferred by mainland authorities, according to the precedent during the Provisional Court era, an official document from the local court or the Municipal Public Security Bureau under the Municipal Government must be submitted to the court before the transfer is approved. Today, the Sixth District only has a letter, which does not seem serious enough. Chen Lu-shi also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend her. Judge Feng instructed the defendant to be detained pending the official document from the court, while Chunlan was temporarily detained at the Jiliang Institute.</p>

<p>Fatally Crushed by the Car</p>
<p>Yang Ji-tang, a beggar from Shandong, had a nine-year-old daughter named He-er who followed in his footsteps, begging for money from passersby on Kangqu Road in southern Shanghai. Recently, with many people visiting Longhua, the beggars saw it as a good opportunity, chasing after and running regardless of the dangers in the road. At 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, a car returning from Longhua sped past, knocking He-er down and crushing her skull, killing her instantly. The driver sped away, leaving the victim with no way to seek justice. Yesterday, the Fifteenth Ward's Baozhang (local security officer) Gu Zhonglian reported the incident to the local court. Inspector Li and others confirmed the death and ordered the body to be collected.</p>

<p>Requires Autopsy by a Western Doctor</p>
<p>The case of Bian Zhaojin, the owner of a rosewood workshop at No. 1, Lane 29, Tianzhutang Street, South City Xinpu Yutang, who died after being beaten by his nephew Bian Wan, has been reported yesterday. It is now known that the case originated when Bian Linwan owed Bian Zhaojin more than 20 yuan. Bian Zhaojin demanded repayment, and Bian Linwan agreed to pay 5 yuan first, promising to pay on the date before that, but the money was not forthcoming and a fight broke out. The next day, after Bian Zhaojin died, Bian Linwan went into hiding. The deceased's family then went to the Second District Second Precinct to accuse him, saying that there was also an accomplice named Huang Siyuan. So the precinct first arrested Huang Siyuan. Huang Siyuan's wife, in desperation, found Bian Linwan yesterday morning and dragged him to the precinct. They were transferred to the local court for pretrial by Inspector Li. The defendants claimed that they did not beat the deceased, and that the deceased had committed suicide by swallowing opium. But the daughter of the deceased, Bian Xiaoyun, said that her father was a member of the rationalist sect and did not use tobacco or alcohol, and that he was beaten to death. The official instructed that the defendants be detained temporarily and went to the scene to inspect the body for a long time. It was difficult to determine how he died, so he ordered the body to be taken to the court. In the afternoon, forensic doctor Liu Nan-qun performed an autopsy. At the time, he could not immediately determine the cause of death, and said that he would bring the viscera to the court for testing and then report. The body was collected by the family.</p>

<p>Burning Down Six Grass Houses by the Roadside</p>
<p>The official operation of steam-powered automobiles on the Songhu Branch Road has been reported in this newspaper. However, the chimney of the car emits a lot of sparks, which is inconvenient for passengers on the platform and pedestrians by the roadside. Yesterday, the wind was strong. When the car was running, sparks from the chimney were continuously emitted like flying flowers. At about 9:00 a.m., when passing Zhanghuabang Station, sparks landed on the Chen family's thatched house by the roadside, igniting it instantly, spreading to the neighboring houses, and becoming a raging fire. The Wusong fire brigades were alerted. Because the road was narrow, they could not get to the scene to put out the fire. In less than half an hour, all six thatched houses were reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>Printing Reactionary Newspapers</p>
<p>Five Workers Arrested</p>
<p>Recently, reactionary publications have been found in the market, and although their sale has been banned and news vendors arrested and punished, the printing location is very secret, making it difficult to eradicate the source. To prevent such reactionary publications from appearing again, the concession authorities have ordered all police stations to pay attention and crack down on printing houses and prohibit printing. It has now been discovered that the "Hai Guang Daily" and "Dong Fang Bao", two newspapers whose publication is prohibited, are printed by the Guangming Printing House on Parker Road. At 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, detective Zhou Guisheng from the Xinzha police station, along with Western detective chief Huai Tuo, went to the printing house and confiscated 1,000 copies each of the two reactionary newspapers and arrested five printing workers: Wang Desheng, Jin Zhusheng, Qian Tianbao, Ji Genquan, Cheng Agui. Yesterday, they were taken to the Special District Local Court. Lawyer Ru Bao-yi represented the police in prosecuting them and requested punishment according to Article 160 of the Criminal Law. The detectives testified that when they went to search the premises, Wang Desheng was proofreading, and the other four were printing. When questioned, Wang Desheng gave evasive answers, claiming that he was visiting a friend at the printing house. The other four defendants admitted that they were workers at the printing house, which was owned by a person with the surname Yu. The newspapers were brought in by Yu for printing. Wang Desheng had come to the printing house to collect them yesterday. Judge Feng ordered the defendants to be detained and rescheduled the hearing. The Guangming Printing House was temporarily sealed, and the police were ordered to seize its books and present them to the court.</p>

<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities operates the Pujiang Ferry. In order to provide preferential treatment to various municipal agencies traveling to and from the Pujiang River, it previously issued a type of free pass and stipulated regulations, which have been revised and disclosed in the newspapers. Recently, the Bureau, considering the Municipal Ferry as a municipal business, and in order to strive for progress, has strictly limited the issuance of free passes and added a type of half-price pass. It has also drafted regulations for the issuance of free and half-price passes for the Pujiang Ferry, which have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation.

<p>Wang Zhaocheng, the supervising director of the Songhu Jiaoyangyuan, since taking over as the director of the institute, arrives at the institute every morning at 10:00 a.m. and goes to the office set up in the Shangzhenghui (Association for the Promotion of Commerce and Government) at 5:00 p.m. to supervise the staff. He works earnestly and has made remarkable achievements. The institute has a very large amount of space, which can be planted. He specially applied to the Bureau of Social Affairs for tree seedlings and flowers, which were planted around the boundary. He pays special attention to hygiene, such as rebuilding the morgue and toilets, personally drawing bridges and estimating repairs, and submitting them to the Bureau of Social Affairs for review and handling. Subsequently, he was instructed that the drawings he presented were proper and the estimated repairs were appropriate. The Public Security Bureau wrote to ask him to plan a shelter for female beggars. He is now discussing it with the board of directors in order to make it a reality. In the future, the funds raised will be used to build a shelter for women, which is also the gospel of the female community.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Wu Wenhua and Others Survey Yutang Yesterday <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (2nd) at 10:00 a.m., Wu Wenhua, Director of the County Construction Bureau, along with Yang Fulin, head of the Third District, Peng Liren, head of the Second District, and more than ten local gentry including Peng Yinqiao, Sun Shiben, Chen Danian, Ni Binzhi, and Jiang Shijie, surveyed Yutang. Starting from the Huangpu River and heading west along Yutang, passing Tangwan and reaching Beiqiao, they traveled fifteen or sixteen li in total. It is planned that tomorrow they will go from Beiqiao, passing Machiao and directly reaching the lower reaches, Yuerjing. The situation of yesterday's survey is recorded below: (1) From the entrance of Huangpu to Yutang Bridge, it is about one mile. The river channel can still pass through smoothly, and there is no need to dredge this section. However, the riverbed from Yutang Bridge, Tangwan Town to Beiqiao is very silted. According to the old dredging precedent, the river surface is four zhang. But for future transportation, it is not enough to widen the river surface to five or six zhang. This matter is of great importance, and will be discussed at the meeting to be taken seriously. (2) From near Yutang Bridge, the river suddenly turns north to Xinmu Bridge, which is about two miles long and forms an arc, commonly known as Be灣 (North Bay). Also to the east of Xinmu Bridge and west of Yutang Bridge, there is a Jinjia River, about half a li long, which goes east to Yutang and west to Xinmu Bridge, like a diameter. It is suggested that the Yutang Bridge section be filled in and used as public property, and that the river be changed to come out of Yutang through Jinjia River, which will not affect farmland water conservancy and will save a lot of effort in engineering. This matter also needs to be discussed at the meeting. (3) From Huangpu westward along Yutang, passing Tangwan Town and reaching Beiqiao, there are a total of six large and small bridges. Among them, four can still be used, but two wooden bridges are in disrepair and dangerous for pedestrians. It is necessary to know how to repair or rebuild them, which can be determined according to the budget in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Handling the Issue of Company Public Reserve Fund <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The Accountants Association Submits an Explanation to the Ministry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Accountants Association, based on a letter from member Jin Zongcheng, a CPA, requesting an explanation of whether the company's public reserve fund is the right of shareholders or whether labor can also share in the profits, stated that the matter concerns laws and regulations and cannot be arbitrarily discussed from a theoretical perspective. It submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stating that it was submitting for instruction regarding the handling of the company's public reserve fund and earnestly requested that it be forwarded for interpretation. The matter was reported by the member Jin Zongcheng stating that a company has a total capital of 50,000 yuan and a public reserve fund of more than 100,000 yuan. Now the shareholders propose to increase the capital, that is, to distribute the public reserve fund to the shareholders as shares, but the labor force opposes it, thinking that the public reserve fund is the public reserve of the company and that the labor force should also share in the profits. According to commercial practice, at the end of each accounting period, all profits, in addition to the public reserve fund, are also used to pay bonuses to the labor force. Where do these flowers come from? In fact, it is the same nature as the public reserve fund, and it is income distributed under the profit item. However, whether this public reserve fund can be shared by labor is not clearly stipulated in commercial law. In order to seek a solution and have something to follow, a special letter is sent for inquiry and it is requested that it be put forward for discussion at the meeting. Based on this, after discussion at the association meeting, it was determined that the matter concerns laws and regulations and cannot be arbitrarily discussed from a theoretical perspective. It is appropriate to submit the letter from the member containing the various sections to the Ministry, earnestly requesting that it be forwarded to the judicial authorities for interpretation and reply, so that there may be compliance. It is now heard that the association has received a reply from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Shangzi No. 9089, which states that the report has been received and the situation has been reported to the Executive Yuan for forwarding for interpretation. Further instructions should await arrival at the Ministry before verification.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Shangzhenghui Reports on the Process of Reorganizing the Silk and Satin Industry <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The Shangzhenghui reported to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the process of reorganizing the silk and satin industry groups. The case was based on recent reports that the Shanghai Shandong Henan Silk Industry Association, the Zhehu Crepe Industry Association, the Hang Silk Industry Qianjiang Guild Hall, the Su Satin Industry Xuejin Association, etc., had submitted a document to the Ministry stating that the association was forcibly merging existing organizations with completely different business natures and requested relief. The Shangzhenghui could have remained silent before the Ministry instructed the Shangzhenghui to restore order after consulting with the various Gongsuo, but in order to expedite the progress of the Shangzhenghui's reorganization of the silk and satin industry groups, the Shangzhenghui, lest the misunderstanding of this industry should hinder the reorganization process, would have no small impact on the reorganisation plan, so the Shangzhenghui had made a detailed statement to the Ministry, stating the misunderstandings and misinterpretations of the industry, in the hope that the misunderstandings would be quickly corrected, and not to be repetitive. In order to facilitate public convenience, it is hereby announced that the reorganisation of commercial organisations by the Association is carried out in accordance with the powers conferred by the central government's formulation of the organisational outline, and the standard for the reorganisation is based entirely on the Law of the Industrial and Commercial Association promulgated by the National Government, and the procedure for the reorganisation and organisation of the Industrial and Commercial Association drafted by the Association has also been submitted to the Central Party Department and the Ministry for separate filing, except that the first and second articles of the procedure have been approved by the Central Party Department and were deemed to be illegal, The rest of the articles have been regarded as supplementary provisions to the Law of the Industrial and Commercial Association and its Implementing Rules, and do not conflict with the laws and regulations, and the original complaint that the provisions of the articles are in fact intended to be enforced is in fact contrary to the provisions of Article 14 of the Law of the Industrial and Commercial Association, which requires that those whose purposes are in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of this Law be ordered to reorganise themselves at regular intervals, and that they still have to meet the requirements of Article 3, which states that there shall be one association in one area, and this principle is clear and cannot be disregarded, the Gongsuos are also aware that it cannot be denied on this point, and therefore strongly assert that the Gongsuos have no other completely identical organisations in the city, and that the term 'same industry' in Article 3 of the Law of the Industrial and Commercial Association, in short, means that the business is the same, The Gongsuos are engaged in the sale of silk and satin, although there is a classification of silk crepe yarns and government silk among them, just as the tea sold by the tea industry has products from various provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the detailed differences in the names of their tea, which fill up pages, are just like the classification of silk crepe yarns and government silk, and so is the rice industry and other industries, to give just the above two examples, then the same tea and the same rice, the source of the goods is different, the selling price is different, the cost is different, the freight is different, the sales are different, and the taxation is different, the eight points raised by the Gongsuo in its original submission are almost all similar, if so, apart from tea shops and tea warehouses, rice shops and rice shops, the differences in the eight points are almost all similar, and if so, apart from tea shops and tea warehouses, and rice shops and rice shops, because of the different businesses, there are separate organisations, and the rest have not heard of the classification of goods, which means that they are not completely the same industry and cannot have the same organisation, that the different points raised by the Gongsuos are the sole reason for the silk and satin industry and their persistence in opposing it is because the Gongsuos have had separate organisations in history, and that they cannot be compared to the tea industry and others, even though they have different places of origin and categories, but the so-called different businesses by the Gongsuos are not really different businesses, but are due to different gangs, and that they want to preserve their historical position, whether different gangs in the same industry are allowed to form separate organisations, As an exception to Article 5 of the Law of Industrial and Commercial Associations, although there is no explicit provision, Article 4 of the Association's Procedures for Reorganisation and Organisation was enacted in the interest of the commercial situation, with the proviso that "if there are any customs or business practices that are not possible to merge, they may be varied at the discretion of the Association after verification", which was subsequently approved by the Central Government as being illegal and ordered to be deleted immediately, and the words "habitual history" etc. have been deleted in compliance with the order, and a separate document has been submitted to the Council for the record, so that the organisation with the same business but different gangs and histories must be merged in accordance with the law, as

<p>The Two Shens Are Detained and Warned</p>
<p>The notorious thief Shen Ajin, in collusion with Shen Changlin and the fugitive Wang Arong, stole clothing from the Senchang Pawnshop and the home of Pan Youliang at No. 1 Pingjili Road on multiple occasions last month, worth over 1,000 yuan. They also used sleeping drugs to knock the victims unconscious. The case was discovered by detectives Mao Jingen and Lu Zhulin of the French Police Station, who arrested the suspects and recovered the stolen goods. They were brought to the French Court. When questioned, the defendants gave evasive answers. The judge ordered them to be investigated further. They were brought in for another questioning yesterday, and the Western police chief stated that the defendants had confessed to the crimes at the police station and presented their confessions for review. At this point, the defendants bowed their heads and admitted their guilt, begging for leniency. Judge Zhu sentenced Shen Ajin to two years in the Western Prison and Shen Changlin to one year.</p>

<p>Investigation Reveals Theft from a French Ship</p>
<p>At 3:40 a.m. yesterday, Western officers from the River Patrol Police were patrolling in a boat when they spotted a rowing boat speeding on the river near the China Merchants Zhongzhan Wharf in Hongkou, looking suspicious. They immediately went forward and searched the boat, discovering a large batch of broadcloth of various colors, totaling twenty-seven pieces, worth more than 5,000 yuan. They confiscated the boat and goods and took them to the police station for investigation. The police station, recognizing the value of the broadcloth, dispatched detective Sun Agui to investigate its origin. It was learned that two men from Jiangbei, Li Xiaoliuzi and Chen Xiaoerzi, had stolen the broadcloth from a French merchant ship docked at China Merchants Zhongzhan, intending to sell it privately. They managed to apprehend Li and Chen and brought them to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, the two were handed over to the French court for trial yesterday because the owner of the goods was a French merchant. The stolen goods were returned to the owner.</p>

<p>Commerce Press Workers' Union: A declaration demanding that the company provide rice subsidies states that the company has been increasingly hardening its stance towards us workers for the past year. We can say with certainty that it is relying on evil forces to restore its position from before the fourteenth year of the Republic and intensify its oppression. We, as oppressed and suffering workers, are now facing an extraordinary rise in rice prices, and we, along with our parents, wives, and children, are finding it extremely difficult to survive in this half-starved state. Therefore, we request the company to find a way to provide relief. However, the company authorities, wearing a mask of culture, are heartlessly harming us and only know how to enrich themselves. They are unwilling to show any sympathy for our plight and have severely rejected our extremely small hope of getting enough to eat. Now that we have reached this point, what else can we say? The meal allowance for employees at the distribution office has already been increased by two yuan, and this money is also provided by the company. Don't the workers at our printing press need to eat? To be honest, this action of ours is not only to solve the immediate problem of rice subsidies, but also to issue a major warning to these cunning capitalists who absolutely cannot be sincerely cooperative with us. If we give in this time, not only will we have no room to speak in the future, but the company will probably make further advances and re-exploit the small amount of benefits we have already obtained. When we think of the history of past struggles and the blood of many martyrs, how can we easily abandon it? How can we be willing to return to a life of slavery? Of course, we are absolutely unwilling. Therefore, we have made a great determination to fight them to the death. We are willing to endure all pain and suffering, even at the cost of our lives. Our vision is already very clear that without considerable sacrifice, we cannot obtain considerable compensation. We are in this dark and depressing state of groaning, and the capitalists are engaged in an offensive plan. To fight for a glimmer of hope, only united solidarity and forward struggle will lead to the final victory, which of course belongs to us.</p>

<h3 id="e235">Hen Transformed into Rooster <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Gong Zhi</p>
<p>Recently, a family surnamed Wang in the West Market and a family surnamed Hu in the Former Port both had roosters laying eggs. This reminded me that I personally witnessed a hen transforming into a rooster last year. Therefore, I am recording this for those who are curious and want to talk about it. In the North Market of Zhouzhuang Township, Wuxian County, at the home of a Chen family five or six houses away from where I live, several chickens are raised. They are always released to feed in the vacant land behind the house every morning. This is a daily routine. One day, a hen inexplicably transformed into a rooster. It would crow in the middle of the day. Later, it was seen by neighbors, and it was immediately spread as a strange event. I heard about it and went to see it. I waited until noon, and the crowing did occur. I also saw it chasing the other hens and mating with them. As for its appearance, the comb, wattle, and tail feathers gradually increased. Its behavior completely lost its feminine demeanor. People said that the change in domestic animals was a bad omen. The Chen family was deceived by these unfounded rumors and chopped off its head and cooked it. This happened in early May of the 18th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>According to historical records, the transformation of a hen into a rooster does happen occasionally and is not uncommon. But I have never witnessed it before. For example, in the first year of Huanglong during the reign of Emperor Xuan of the Han Dynasty, a hen in the Luling car in the Weiyang Palace transformed into a rooster. In the reign of Emperor Yuan, during the Chuyuan period, in the home of the historian in the Prime Minister's Office, a hen incubating eggs gradually transformed into a rooster. In the first year of Guanghe during the reign of Emperor Ling, a hen in the Southern Palace Servant Temple transformed into a rooster. In the second year of Jingchu during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Wei Dynasty, a hen in the courtyard of the imperial court transformed into a rooster. During the reign of Emperor Yuan of the Jin Dynasty, in Taixing, when Wang Dun was stationed in Wuchang, a hen transformed into a rooster. In August of the first year of Long'an during the reign of Emperor An, in the home of Wang Daozi of Langya, a black hen transformed into a red rooster. In the second year of Yuanxing during the reign of Emperor An, a hen in Hengyang transformed into a rooster. These are only cases where the frontier officials reported the anomalies to the court, and the historians recorded them. How many more cases were scattered in remote villages and fields that were not reported? It can be seen that chickens are the easiest birds to transform, and no other birds have been known to transform. The body constitution may be the reason. In scientific terms, since the discovery of endocrinology by medical scientists, it is known that the human body contains various secretory substances, each with unique properties, which have a chemical association with the products of other organs in the body. That is, there is a chemical interaction in the body. As for the formation and change of sex, it is controlled by the gonads (Keimdrisen). Therefore, it can be changed by artificial addition, subtraction, or replacement. Once replaced, it not only affects the surface, but also the bones, organs, properties, and sounds all change. In 1849, Berthold performed a testicular transplant experiment on chickens, which was able to restore the castrated chicken to its original state. The comb, wattle, feathers, crowing, mating, and all other characteristics of a rooster were fully restored. Decades later, Steinach experimented by exchanging the gonads of male and female animals, which could make the female male and the male female. For example, a female chicken can grow a comb, wattle, change its feathers, crow, and start mating. Mice or rabbits, after gonad transplantation, will change their weak bones, soft fur, full fat, large nipples, and the inherent sexual characteristics of females. When males see them, they will raise their tails and chase them. The mammary glands secrete milk and breastfeed their young. The reason for this obvious and amazing result is the existence of a kind of awakening hormone called Hormon. In social terms, to prove its reason in simple and easy-to-understand terms, the ancient technique of castrating chickens can be pondered and understood. More than half of the problem will be solved.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Record of Cheng Yushuang Learning Swordplay <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Romantic Scholar</p>
<p>Cheng Yushuang (Yanqiu) stopped performing at the Xinxin Theater because she was getting fatter. Some said that she would never return to the stage. Those who hoped she would make a name for herself felt sorry for her. But a guest from Tianjin said that Cheng was performing at the Xinxin Grand Theater in Tianjin. Not only was her figure not too bloated, but her singing had reached a higher level. In particular, her performance in the drama "The Story of Red Whiskers" actually incorporated real swordplay, and she danced with a sword on the stage. The reason for this was that Cheng had been learning martial arts from a teacher. I am recording the guest's words to inform those who care about Yushuang's affairs.</p>
<p>Previously, Yushuang was introduced by the owner of Chunming Hall to learn from the boxing master Han. Later, she had to stop because she was busy. Later, as she got fatter and more sluggish, someone suggested that she learn Tai Chi. Yushuang thought it was a good idea and resumed learning from Gao Ziyun. Gao is a famous martial arts master from the north. He used to be the captain of Cao Kunshan's bodyguard. Recently, he has given up fame and devoted himself to teaching. After Yushuang became his student, he loved her for her intelligence and love of learning, and taught her all his skills. Yushuang was also very focused on her studies. In less than three months, she mastered the Qiankun sword. Yushuang said that she was very interested in swordplay. She had once joined a temporary performance at the Beijing YMCA and won the praise of many people. This further encouraged her ambition. This time, when she performed in Tianjin, she extracted the essence of swordplay and incorporated it into her performance. The sword dance scene was therefore transformed into a masterpiece. It was very different from ordinary performers of the drama. Not only did laymen find it colorful and exciting, but even martial arts experts praised it.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Interesting Tidbits from Songjiang <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Si Zhong</p>
<p>(1) Old Shoes Ascend to Heaven</p>
<p>The only means of transportation in Songjiang has always been sedan chairs. The word "sedan chair" sounds like "old shoes" in the mouths of Songjiang people. In the years when sedan chairs were popular, you could often hear the sound of "old shoes...ascending to heaven" on the streets. This was the sedan chair carriers warning pedestrians to be careful of the approaching sedan chair. That's why they used a shortened sound, saying "sedan chair...ascending to heaven." Unexpectedly, now these many "old shoes" have really ascended to heaven. Because since the bridge was demolished, rickshaws have become popular on the streets. It has been a long time since we saw these many "old shoes." Isn't this really ascending to heaven?</p>
<p>(2) Horizontal Winnowing Cart</p>
<p>Songjiang people call rickshaws "yellow winnowing carts." Unexpectedly, this "yellow winnowing cart" has truly lived up to its name. Why? Because the streets of Songjiang are still made of unbreakable stone slabs, and there are many uneven places. This kind of rickshaw, pulled on uneven roads, bumps up and down. If you are not careful, you will be winnowed out to the side of the road. Isn't this "winnowing cart" living up to its name?</p>
<h3 id="e238">Snippets of Dog Catching in Suzhou <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Cen Zhu</p>
<p>Suzhou has been catching stray dogs since the time when Yin Shisheng was the director of the Public Security Bureau. However, due to the opposition of local philanthropists, it never came to fruition. After Zou Xiaogong took over, he believed that stray dogs hindered sanitation and harmed people. In fact, the elimination could not be delayed. After being approved by the bureau's meeting recently, it was announced that the registration procedures for domestic dogs would be completed. The capturing started in the East District first a few days ago. There are many interesting stories. Now, I will pick up and record some of them as follows.</p>
<p>Dogs Do Jump Over Walls: The shelter for stray dogs in the East District is in the garden behind the ancestral hall in Aimen Lane. Reed sheds are built on both sides for the dogs to rest. The walls on all sides are not very high. Some fierce and frightened dogs can climb on the shed and jump over the wall. As the saying goes, "People will jump over beams in desperation, and dogs will jump over walls in desperation." This is true.</p>
<p>Dog Car Surrounded Fore and Aft: The tool for catching dogs is a three- to four-foot-long bamboo tube with a rattan ring tied to one end. Whenever a stray dog is seen, it is looped around its neck and pulled tight so that it cannot escape. Then, its feet are lifted and stuffed into the dog car. The car can hold three or four dogs. After being captured, the car is pushed all the way to the shelter. Several policemen follow, and there are also spectators surrounding and pushing forward. The stray dogs in the car are treated as if they were encountering such a thing. It is enough to be proud of.</p>
<p>Stray Dogs Flee in All Directions: This time, the capture of stray dogs is not being carried out simultaneously throughout the city. Therefore, the dogs in the East District are fleeing to other districts. Whenever they see policemen wearing black uniforms and white-rimmed hats, they run away in desperation. Those who catch dogs are all these policemen. Who can say that animals have no spirit?</p>
<p>Obstacles in Dog Catching: The capture of dogs should be carried out simultaneously throughout the city to achieve the effect of catching them all at once. The reason why they are capturing in different districts and building stray dog shelters first is all due to the advocacy of the Buddhist Association of Wu County. With this obstacle, it is impossible to do it thoroughly. Therefore, from the perspective of one corner of the East District, although they are said to be caught, stray dogs are still wandering on the market, and there are still many of them.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Customs Kill People <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>We all know that customs can influence people. But I have never heard of them killing people. I will record them in Free Talk.</p>
<p>The Custom of Burning Paper Money: The saying that Qingming is as important as the New Year is widely spread. But no place is as strict as Songjiang and Shanghai. Every Qingming, in addition to worshiping at the ancestral tombs, you must burn paper money at the homes of relatives. Burning paper money is commonly called "burning grass paper money." Grass paper money is made of rice straw tied into a flat and round object about a foot in diameter, filled with mountain paper money ingots, and covered with flowers cut from red and green paper. People hold this and go back and forth to each other as a great gift. It is said that stopping burning paper money is tantamount to declaring the severance of kinship. The relatives never make appointments on the same day. Therefore, there is always someone coming to each house, and every household is busy buying fish and meat. According to people's estimates, it costs at least fifteen yuan to get through this as-big-as-New Year's festival. In a world where disasters are frequent, goods are expensive, and life is difficult, how can people not complain?</p>
<p>Customs Kill People: In a rural village in Nanhui, south of Shanghai, a farmer's wife surnamed Mou was extremely poor because of repeated disasters. She could only fill her stomach with red flower porridge. Red flower is purple cloud clover. Farmers use it as green fertilizer. But this woman used it to fill her stomach. One day at noon, a guest arrived. The guest came holding grass paper money. According to the custom, the woman should be busy entertaining the guest. But she had nothing to offer. In a moment of panic, another guest arrived. The woman's anxiety cannot be described. In a mixture of resentment and shame, she had a thought of death. On one hand, she reluctantly entertained the guests. After inviting them to sit down, she turned and went to the back room, as if preparing something to entertain them. Who knew that she had hanged herself on the broken bed at this time? The guests waited for a long time and did not see her come out. They called her but she did not answer. They began to think it was strange. They went in together to look and saw that she had stuck out her tongue and widened her eyes, showing that she could not express her suffering and hatred. If it were not for this custom, the woman would not have thought of committing suicide even if she was poor. Is it too much to say that customs kill people?</p>
<h3 id="e240">Two Ancient Towers in the West <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Qin</p>
<p>Egyptian Pyramid: The pyramids of Egypt are called "Pyramid." According to legend, they were built during the reign of King Khufu in 3124 BC. They occupy more than 20 acres of land and are about 450 feet high. The number of workers and the time required are even more shocking. It took more than 20 years from the beginning of construction to completion, and more than 300,000 craftsmen were hired. To this day, when you pass by its ancient capital, you can still see it standing tall, which is a sigh of the world's unprecedented large building.</p>
<p>Leaning Tower of Rome: Near the city of Sack, Italy, there is a leaning tower called Albarke. The whole body is made of granite and is 270 feet high. The top and the base were deliberately made to be inclined when they were built. From a distance, it looks like it is about to collapse. All travelers from afar will change color when they first pass through this place and dare not linger below it. In fact, the tower has been built for thousands of years and is as solid as new and has never been repaired. This is also amazing.</p>

<p>— Bao Tian Xiao</p>
<p>Chapter Ten: Red Flames Soar to the Sky, a Filial Daughter Admires the Stage / Red Carpet on the Ground, Meeting Famous Actors on the Spot</p>
<p>It turned out that at that time, there was a group of Japanese students. Several comrades who liked to study drama gathered together and formed a drama club, which was the Qingliu Society. At first, when they were in Japan, they would occasionally perform in a small theater when there were some commemorative days. They called it the "Love Beauty Drama." It was just a few students who were interested in drama and played around casually. It was like playing tickets in Chinese old operas, and they would occasionally come to a rehearsal guest appearance or something. It also caused a commotion in the study abroad community. At this time, Chinese drama did not have the trend of male and female co-performance. Therefore, there were no women in male troupes. All the characters dressed as dan roles were male. There were several dan roles in Peking opera. After putting on makeup, they were simply like women. You couldn't tell that he was a man. And the people who supported dan roles regarded them as women, no matter what kind of lyrics, poems, or essays they wrote. It was confusing. Therefore, there was a class of people called "young masters" in the north. At that time, there was another faction of women who performed dramas, which was initially called "fashionable children's operas" and later called "Kun roles." They could not appear on stage with male actors. Therefore, the male roles in their dramas were also filled by Kun actresses. They actually wore beards and appeared on stage in robes and hats. It just felt like they had female voices and female breaths. They were a bit out of sync in terms of vision and hearing. I don't need to mention them for now. As for the newly emerging dramas, the female roles in them were also played by men. There was a Hunanese in this Qingliu Society. These two were both handsome and radiant, like willows in spring. They were all beautiful men among the Japanese students. Because they were fluttering in the world, they naturally looked beautiful and outstanding after dressing up as women. It was because they were as radiant as spring willows that the Qingliu Society lived up to its name. In addition, some people were supposed to play young men, some were supposed to play old men, and some were even born with an old woman's face. They could only play old women in dramas. They were also matched appropriately. They were also very particular about makeup. This was not like the makeup in old dramas. A traitorous minister had a white face, and Cao Cao had to draw a cross on his face. All the generals, etc., had strange faces in red, black, green, and blue. The makeup in new dramas was just embellished according to the shapes of modern people, or imitated according to the identity of the people in the drama. However, beauties, celebrities, villains, and heroes also had to be evident in their faces. At this time, several members of the Qingliu Society had returned to the country. They were preparing to give a public performance in Shanghai. Because several classmates had returned to China, those who were farmers and friends in the interior had to go back to visit their families. Some had already found some jobs and would soon go to work. While everyone was not dispersed, it was necessary to give a public performance.</p>

<h3 id="e245">Foreign Exchange Not Weak, Interest Rates Stable <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Single Coins Suddenly Rise More Than Half a Cent. General Market Overview: Yesterday's foreign exchange market was thriving on the banking side. Money dealers mostly bought and sold existing foreign exchange notes and remittances among themselves. There was little news of new transactions. However, interest rates were ultimately determined by supply and demand, and the market could absorb them as much as possible. Therefore, it was difficult to expect a turnaround in the short term. The rate remained stable at 0.072 yuan, and the money market remained as loose as before, so prices did not rise or fall. Interest Rate Breakdown: The "foreign interest" rate was 0.072 yuan in the morning, slightly better than the previous day by 0.00125 yuan. Due to reduced transactions in the morning market, people were lax, and the closing price was the same as the morning price. The "silver interest" rate was still 0.05 yuan in both morning markets, with no difference from the previous day. Remittances were still done without adding extra charges, and the use of blank remittances was rampant. Auxiliary Currency Market Conditions: Jiangnan small foreign coins were purchased very actively by small dealers on behalf of customers, so prices rose steadily. The morning price was 0.0621 yuan, and the noon price suddenly rose by 0.0004 yuan to 0.0625 yuan. As a result, it rose a total of 0.0009 yuan compared to the previous day's morning price, and trading was therefore brisk. There were 6,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 14,000 jiao in the morning market. Guangdong small foreign coins rose slightly by 0.0001 yuan, with the morning price at 0.0597 yuan and the noon price at 0.05975 yuan. The volume traded was 135,000 jiao in the morning market and 65,000 jiao in the noon market. The term yuan was slightly short at 500 cash, or 396,000 cash.</p>

<p>The yarn market has strengthened due to rising American cotton prices and slightly improved sentiment. The lack of new sellers is also a factor. However, the current situation is serious, and buying interest in the market is difficult to be strong. Yunnan merchants bought over 3,000 bales of ten-count coarse yarn. The news shook confidence. At the same time, a certain factory adopted a strong attitude, and many retail investors saw the situation turning unfavorable. There were also many who covered short positions. Human Standard Supported by Spot Sales. The Human Standard opened strong in the morning, and was dried due to searching and buying of a certain manufacturer after the closing day. The market rose, with each month increasing by five or six qian. The profit takers in the first, second and third trades liquidated and fell, and then rose again at the close. As a result, each month rose one or two qian. In the afternoon, the Yunnan merchants actively purchased with brisk buying sentiment. The near month rose two, three, or six qian, and the far month was flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,600 bales. The Human Standard closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Human Standard Closing Prices, Rise/Fall, Account Balance</p>
<p>July 1520, Up 0.02, 23,700</p>

<p>Yunnan Merchants Actively Purchase Spot Goods. Spot yarn sales suddenly surged, and Yunnan merchants were very interested in purchasing. The total number of spot and forward goods purchased by various merchants throughout the day was 4,280 bales. Among them, fellow traders purchased 685 bales. Market prices were firm.

<p>The cotton market was very strong, mainly because American cotton had been rising for several consecutive days, and the situation was quite tight. Therefore, retail investors covered short positions, and a large investor entered with a large number of bales, resulting in a stronger market trend. However, some profit-takers took advantage of the rising prices to liquidate, so the market fell slightly in the afternoon, but the overall trend remained tight. Han Standard Rose by Two Qian Due to Covering Short Positions. The market opened strong in the morning due to rising American cotton prices, and buying interest in the market increased. Number seven tried hard to cover short positions, and each month rose sharply by one to three qian. In the afternoon, buying sentiment eased slightly, and prices fell back by 0.005 to 0.015 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 37,800 dan. The closing prices of the Han Standard are recorded below:</p>

High-grade Northern Jiangsu rice uniformly fell by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan, and sellers were also eager to sell. The situation for rice has now changed, and it would not be surprising if subsequent prices were to decline. Thin rice varieties are not in demand, with prices slightly below 0.02 yuan, and the market conditions are extremely quiet. Due to limited arrivals of Yangxian rice, sales were sluggish, but prices remained relatively stable due to solid ground. Dujian Zhunjiān rice was stagnant and quiet, with prices falling by about 0.01 yuan. Only high-quality goods for distribution were active, while the trend for mid-range goods was very weak. The arrival and sales of Bianyuan rice were both sluggish. Although the prices of Geng and Xian rice varieties had risen, Baiyuan rice had not been able to follow the trend and prosper. Therefore, even with the decline in prices, Yuánmǐ rice remained stable.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: River cargo arrivals were observed, approximately twenty ships. Sales in this area are largely stagnant. Changshu Baigeng rice fell by 0.15 yuan, while Suzhou Tongji rice fell by varying amounts, from 0.02 to 0.03 yuan, with strong selling pressure. The market is gradually reversing. The thin early rice from Southern Jiangsu, which had experienced a false increase at the end of last month, is now being affected by increased arrivals and a soft market in Zhabei. Sales are increasingly weak, with large quantities being sold at discounts of over 0.02 yuan. Transaction volumes for the entire day were scarce, indicating sluggish buying appetite. The amount of Yangxian rice in storage and arrival remains limited, and sales are still active. While Du Zi Xian rice and various other Xian rice varieties from other regions are inquired about, transactions are only small and sporadic. Since foreign rice prices are still low, sellers are unwilling to repair the previous prices. However, reports indicate that the next batch of foreign rice will arrive, and the buying appetite from both local and foreign buyers has weakened. Consequently, the price of local Xian rice has declined, dropping by 0.01 yuan. The market for Yinhua Tongbian rice remains consistent, with buyers only selecting ordinary</p>
<p>varieties for slight purchases, and prices barely maintaining their original levels.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Foreign Rice Prices Drop Again by 0.04-0.05 Yuan <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>The foreign rice market, after softening the previous day, saw both local and out-of-town merchants uniformly maintaining a quiet and reserved stance. With the arrival of new shipments yesterday, sentiment among all buyers turned pessimistic. A segment of speculators eagerly sought to sell off their holdings, but with only a slight decline in market prices, there was little interest. This led to a substantial drop of 0.04-0.05 yuan. No. 1 Saigon rice, which had been opening at 15.5 yuan in the morning, was priced at 15.1 to 15.2 yuan in the afternoon, but there were no inquiries. Small-kernel rice was priced at 14.8 to 14.6 yuan, and large-kernel rice was priced at 14.2 yuan. Total transactions in the spot market amounted to over 2,000 bags, with nearly 1,000 tons of goods en route. Foreign futures firms continued to show selling interest, while reclaimed goods saw sluggish sales.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Off-Season Time, Flour Prices Weaken Instead <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>The flour market was sluggish and depressed yesterday. Although foreign wheat prices were quoted higher by 0.05-0.07 yuan, market sentiment was not excited. Despite the current demand for finished and by-product flour, No. 2 flour received little attention. Flour mills were selling off goods. From the intention to, if the bulls still want to stubbornly raise the price, it will inevitably lead to the opening of a large number of warehouse receipts. Therefore, despite the off-season and the fact that factories are generally claiming to be out of stock, the market has turned flat and weary. As for the forward months, due to the favorable weather since the beginning of spring, it is expected that a good harvest will occur. Therefore, people's hearts are gradually softening. If actual sales do not improve, near-term and far-term sentiment may be difficult to excite excessively. As a result, the current month was down 0.0005 yuan compared to the previous day, May was down 0.001 yuan, June was down 0.00125 yuan, July was down 0.001 yuan, August was down 0.00075 yuan, and September was unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e253">The Wheat Market is Full of Shorting <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Factories Bought Over 11,000 Bags of Spot Wheat. Yesterday, wheat futures uniformly fell. In the near term, due to factory inaction and lackluster speculative activity, the market gradually softened. As for the new crop of far-term months, the weather is fine and the climate is conducive to wheat seedlings. There, inland merchants have ceased activity, and some have even switched to short positions. Local brokers believe that the new crop arrival this year, based on previous years, is already at a peak price, so many are shorting, causing prices to gradually decline. If the current situation becomes more severe, the market may become more sluggish. As a result, the current month was down 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day, June was down 0.04 yuan, July was down 0.02 yuan, and August and September were down 0.03 yuan each. Spot wheat was largely stable, as high-quality wheat was similar to the standard. Mid-range wheat showed signs of softening. Due to the sales of flour, factories were also buying actively. Qingjiangpu wheat was quoted at 5.111 tael, Nansuizhou wheat and Bengbu wheat were quoted at 5.11 tael, Mingguang wheat was quoted at 5.08 tael, Jiangxi wheat was quoted at 5.0 tael, and Dongtai wheat was quoted at 5.03 tael, for a total of 11,777 bags, which were opened by Fufeng and Yu</p>
<h3 id="e254">Soybean Market Stable <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market remained stable. The source of goods from Dalian continued to arrive, and sales were acceptable. According to the afternoon telegram from Dalian, futures prices rose slightly, so merchants' appetites were quite strong. Ordinary Dalian beans were still quoted at 5.38 tael to 5.33 tael, with a total of seven or eight vehicles traded. Local factories also had appetites, and the market was stable. The trading of bean cakes became increasingly brisk, and the buying sentiment of inland merchants was active. June and July futures were both up by 0.005 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Both Chinese and Foreign Textiles Are Consistently Strong <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Local Cotton Cloth and Fine Cloth: The rising trend is becoming increasingly intense, mainly because spot goods have been out of stock for a long time, and there is an unusually strong demand for dyed cloth. Yesterday, Ningbo, Niuzhuang, and Sichuan merchants resumed purchasing. Four-army cloth was quoted at 6.95 tael, and Laba Tong, Caiqiu, and Blue Double Fish were uniformly sold at 6.9 yuan. Blue Flying Fish was already required to be 7.15 tael. The local street bought more Blue Chicken cloth yesterday, opening at 6.675 tael. Fine twill Yanghe cloth also opened at 7.05 tael, and Blue Double Fish at 6.65 tael. As for coarse cloth, 13-pound cloth was shipped to Jiangxi yesterday in 50 pieces. Double Horse cloth was priced at 5.9 yuan, and Siping Lian cloth was priced at 5.85 yuan. Coarse twill cloth remained soft.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Textiles: Eastern goods rose again. Blue striped fabrics and colored fabrics rose by 0.0025 yuan. Hanshan Temple and Zijinshan were both sold at 0.17 yuan. Gray light twill rose by 0.01 yuan, and Zijinshan opened at 0.27 yuan. Caiyunlai was 4.6 yuan. However, white silk gauze with the bronze dog mark was still sold at 3 tael. Yuan Yang Yarn became increasingly firm, with Xiaomei at 9.5 yuan, Dianqiuxiang at 8.4 yuan, and Zijinshan at 8 yuan, and spot goods were unusually scarce. Plain silk, Yanghong Standard, and Zhigong Ni stabilized. Fine Serge continued to rise by 0.0025 yuan, as the list price had long risen. Previously, the market was unable to develop because there was a large amount of inventory. Now, with the slight activity in spring sales, prices are rising sharply. However, Rong merchants, such as those in the Yangtze River basin, have not shown any activity. Northern merchants made some transactions in Western goods yesterday. Taihe Golden Hall printed crepe silk was 0.425 yuan, plain cloth was 0.39 yuan, and woven foreign yarn was sold at 0.375 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Sugar Market: Ice Flower Qing Opens Down 0.01 Yuan <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's communications from producing areas included New York sugar futures for May at 1.76, September at 1.86, and December at 1.92, all down by 0.03. September alone fell by 0.02. New prices for March of next year were 1.97. Java spot sugar and April futures saw</p>

<p>The market for black melon seeds has been slightly weak recently, and prices have dropped slightly again. Yesterday, the Zhenbang firm offered Xu Kui seeds in 160-bag lots, priced at ten taels. Sales were only sporadic. Dangshan seeds sold for eleven taels, Da Jinpian seeds for eleven and a half taels, Tu seeds for ten taels and a half, lower-grade Xu Zhong seeds for nine taels and six qian, Mingguang seeds for nine taels and eight qian, and Dalian seeds for nine taels and six qian. High-grade seeds were priced at thirteen to fourteen taels. Market inventory is still thick, and there is little hope of a recovery in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Raw Silk and Tea Factories Experience Smooth Sales <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Since Japan implemented the gold standard lifting, Yokohama's Japanese silk sales to Europe have plummeted. Although the Japanese government has allocated funds to maintain the market recently, the Japanese gold exchange rate is not low, and it is still difficult to lower the price of Japanese silk. It is difficult to expect a recovery in European and American sales. Overseas silk inventory is abundant, and demand has surged. The Shanghai foreign exchange rate has risen sharply, and the Huangbai raw silk factory's telegram transfers are not weak, and prices are rising. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and others imported 60 bales of Shanghai white raw silk and 14 bales of Sichuan yellow raw silk, both at firm and brisk prices.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Coal and Anthracite Lump Prices Slightly Weak <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for various grades of anthracite lumps was slightly lower, because cargo from inland customers had no large quantities coming in recently. Local counterparts' purchases are also low. Statistics show that yesterday's lump coal trading volume was only over 1,130 tons, and the selling price was slightly weak. The price of coals such as Takao, Hizen, Kaho, Arate, and Matsushima all fell by 2 qian and 5 fen per ton. However, although the demand for lower-grade coal fines is not very large, the market price is still very firm due to scarce inventory.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 18,700 bales of Indian cotton were imported yesterday. 4,997 cases of eggs and 669 pieces of cowhide were shipped to New York. 1,220 barrels of tobacco and 750 cases of cigarettes arrived in Shanghai from the United States. 4,000 tons of Javanese sugar were imported yesterday. 330 tons of tung oil and 150 cases of straw hat braids were shipped to North America. 2,000 pieces of white wax arrived from the United States. 600 boxes of matches were shipped to the Yangtze River. 6,000 tons of steel were shipped from Belgium to Shanghai. 175 pieces of Huzhou silk waste were shipped to the United States. 40,000 packages of Yantai salt were transferred to Hankou.</p>
