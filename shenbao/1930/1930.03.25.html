<p>時評</p>
<h3>英自由黨與工黨合作</h3>
<p>政黨之作用。必以國家大局爲前提。祇爭一黨之私利。植一黨之權勢。而不問其影響於大局爲何如者。則其國之政治。必常在動搖混亂之中。近來世界各國之政局不安定。大抵皆由斯而起。即在日本。恐亦未能免此。凡不得志之政黨。必傾其全力以攻擊在朝之政黨。即不啻傾其全力以攻擊政府。苟有可藉口之資料。必窮搜之以供我攻擊之用。如日政友會今日乘工商業衰落之機會。以攻擊財政失策是也。乃不謂英國自由黨之態度。獨異乎是。</p>
<p>英之自由黨。不能與工黨合作。人所共知者也。反對工黨政府者。正欲藉煤礦案以倒政府。又人所共知者也。乃今之自由黨。忽表示與工黨合作。不復反對政府政策。於是保守黨動議之修正案。遂遭否决。使政府得解除一重大困難。自由黨之爲此。曾宣言五强海會。正在成敗未定之時。自由黨不應在此際有不利於政府之行爲。增加政府困難。使更處於受辱之地位。而我黨亦不應於此負倒閣之責。又以世界工商贸易。正在衰落凋零之際。不欲再爲大選舉而騷擾之。使國人更感不安。其所以不復反對政府之煤礦政策而有意與工黨合作者原因在是是亦可謂能盡政黨之責者矣。</p>
<p>據倫敦電訊。謂兩黨果能合作。則政局危機。必爲一轉。今年五月之選舉。可以不作。政府壽命。至少可延長兩年。麥克唐納亦可放手處理内政外交。以補以今日之局勢。誠不可謂非英政府之大幸。竊謂世界政黨政治之國皆能如英自由黨之以國家大局爲前提者。其政局動搖不安之象。必將日見减少歟。</p>

<p>▲路透社二十二日倫敦電、英相麥唐納致書於期選區、謂渠意本屆國會應維持至少兩年、惟工黨在國會之多數力量、尙不充足、故渠對此未能作最後之一言、工黨政府有偉大的行政程序、非至反對者對於政府所認爲最有益於國家者加以阻撓之時、政府黨進行不已、但國人在此世界贸易蕭索之際、不欲爲大選舉所擾動也云、</p>

<p>▲女丨母親。我將來也要嫁一個丈夫麽。</p>
<p>母丨任你的便。但是世界上的女子。大多數是如此的。</p>
<p>女丨母親。那麽我今年十歲了。就該找一個丈夫去。不見我姑母找了二十年還没有找到麽。</p>

<h3>四川吳又陵先生珍聞</h3>
<p>— 傅琴心</p>
<p>又陵先生。名虞。四川成都人。胡適所謂隻手打孔家店的老英雄。即先生也。先生敎授北京大學。爲時甚久。名滿海内。余於甲子歲。得依翼先生半載。知其事綦詳。謹擇其隱晦未彰者。璅記之。以告士林。</p>
<p>先生早年喪偶。有女數人。皆文學淵博。容態娟妍。其季於前年與河南某君結婚。現偕渡海外留學。仲於美京戀潘力山。先生以其不告而嫁。深惡之。至不通音問　　先生京寓亮果廠五號。幽居一所。至爲閒適。闢大廳爲藏書室。餘兩間爲寢室及應接所。一人執役。供饔飱及瀟掃而已。登其堂。圖書文籍。挿架琳琅。如入萬花之谷。每見其塊然獨處。淵雅淑穆。灑乎似有以樂其樂者。儼然桃源中人也。</p>
<p>先生學說。最爲日本人所愛讀。文虞文錄。幾各手一編。復取其言論。轉載各報章各雜誌。如支那學及支那黎明人物其最著者也。日本現代文學家以及漢學邃深與先生表同情者。海外馳書。備道欵洽。予友儲逸庵。最爲先生所重。過從無虛夕。曾一一見之。言之甚詳。</p>
<p>四川楊庶堪氏。以革命鉅子。曾一度爲段執政時代之農商部長。先生薄之。一日偶遇於友人處。偃蹇不爲禮。退語人曰。楊氏誘於勢利。進退失據。不獨人格有虧。政治生命。亦將斷送矣。</p>
<p>羅瘿公之靈。程玉簃哭之慟。至輟演以悼。先生高之。爲詩以紀其事。余記其［鶯猩蠶蚤久堪傷。曾讀交難感道亡。今日燕台逢國土。傾城顔色俠肝腸。］一首。雖偶爾游戲。亦彬彬大雅。不同凡響矣。</p>
<p>先生性極豪放。喜狎妓。八埠恒有其踪跡。每華燈初張。鈴聲鏗然。有一老人撚髭微笑。偃仰百花中者。則先生最歡時也。其所紀本事詩。香艶絶妙。曾石印精裝。遍贈朋好。即［乍捫私處如墳起］之句。亦以之入顀。足徵其不拘小節矣。先生嫉惡如仇。厭聞世變。年來戰禍益亟。知太平絶望。乃决計舍棄北京。于乙丑夏歸隱故里。杜門著書。自娛桑愉。從此魯殿靈光。獨峙成都郡矣。</p>
<h3>不可思議之常識</h3>
<p>— 炎胄</p>
<p>▲魚骨梗喉　凡遇魚骨梗喉。切不可開口。可將所持之食具。如飯碗酒杯之類。向右旋轉一次。再進飯一口。或飯酒少許。直向喉咽。則梗者立解。此法得之於祝由科。屢試屢騐。然莫解其理也。</p>
<p>▲四肢起核　四肢骨節間。每以運用不愼起一墳起之核。愈漲愈大。雖無大害。但不雅觀。余曾以推重物故。在手背與腕間。隆然起核。中西醫兼治。或謂須貼膏方。或謂須用刀割。但一無效果。後在蘇遇同鄕許桂卿君。謂在雷雨時。以手磨擦。可以漸小而至於消滅。去夏試之。果然。不圖近日復發。然甚小。擬仍於雷雨時試之。有同病者。幸爲我一試而證實之。</p>
<p>以上兩則。皆不可以科學解釋。然以余親試。靈騐不爽。閱者幸勿以無稽而鄙棄之</p>
<h3>改曆新聲</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>各國社會所沿用之日曆。爲時甚古。乃自歐戰之後。忽有提議改定者。其原因有多種。不外以現行之曆。旣艱於記憶。復難於考查。如耶穌復活節。年在何日。又聖誕之期。爲星期幾。年有變更。深感不便。近則美人復舊事重提。改曆聲浪。高唱入雲。本埠英文晚報。曾記此種消息。惟略焉不詳。查美人所擬定之新曆。在約以每年三百六十五日。除去一日。作爲年頭社會公共休息日期。不列於星期之内。其餘日數。平分爲四季。各得九十一日。季有三個月。二小而一大。小者三十天。大者三十一天。如是積四年而遇閏。可增一日於六月之杪。所謂閏日。社會休沐。其不計在星期中。正與年頭相同。如此則閏固無關。曆亦年有一定。縱不用曆本。稍加思索。即可推知某日之爲星期幾。誠覺便利不淺。邇來美國各大城市多組織改歷研究委員會。加入之會中委員及專家。大半均爲銀行家實業家天文學家社會學家曁團體代表政府代表等。而歐洲各國。更聞風繼起。如新近荷蘭改曆委員會成立。該國大學敎授尼傑蘭氏。且親自主席。尼氏爲著名天文學家。對於改曆討論。曾著書出版。引得國民不少同情。據西國報紙所載。美人自主張改曆以後。全世界各處。先後表示贊成。擬取同一之步驟者。截至現在。計有巴拿馬厄瓜多秘魯巴西荷蘭法蘭西匈牙利古巴曁其他小邦約十餘國云。</p>
<h3>海外茶話</h3>
<p>— 天朋自東京寄</p>
<p>威廉二世之滄桑　威廉自亡命荷蘭後。幽居無聊。近度七十一籌誕。昔日繞膝之子孫。今竟無一至者。聞皆因乏旅費。不克成行。威氏回顧當年之盛會。不禁感慨繫之。</p>
<p>▲高十五尺之石首　意大利著名彫刻家拉米納。目下方從事製作加里波爾將軍石　。用世界最大之大理石。計高一丈五尺·氏立於肩上僅及其鼻際。將樹之爲國境標幟。</p>
<p>▲天上飛來之羣魚　英國羅里西亞有名加力司者。忽見羣魚自天上飛來。球塲花壇。遍地皆是。大驚欲狂。市民亦駭爲異事。後經有心者細加研究。乃附近之池魚爲颶風捲起。</p>
<p>▲匈牙利之女毒殺團　匈牙利有一小村名左爾諾者。近獲一女毒殺團三十名。審究之結果。全村之婦人皆有關連。被害者爲丈夫。情婦、少年、兒童等。凡爲所惡者即毒殺之。</p>
<p>▲車失火就救消防署　英國有一蒸發自動車失愼。車掌驅馳不知爲計。警察乃告以速赴消防署撲滅。因得無恙。此乃世界上失火就救之新紀錄也。</p>
<p>▲梵諦岡第一次裁判　最近梵諦岡城用裁判權。爲法王廳復興之首遭。頗爲有興味之問題。旁聽人極衆。犯者爲一竊手。因敎廷法律尙未制定。故暫引用意律判三月徒刑云。</p>

<h3>譚坤伶景艶芳之劇藝</h3>
<p>— 澍霖</p>
<p>坤伶景艶芳。爲景玉峯之愛女。年華二七。體態苗條。從乃母學靑衣花衫劇有年。天資聰慧。加以刻苦自勵。能劇巳有三十餘齣。現獻藝於大世界大京班。余於坤伶素不稱道。一昨爲友人所嬲。偶經其地。適値艶芳演駡殿。不禁駐足而聽。頭塲搖板與第二塲之倒板廻龍腔慢三眼。均婉轉自如。入後二殿快三眼亦流利可聽。此劇雖無甚做工。但聆此數段唱詞。嘗鼎一臠。亦足知其大槪矣。據吾友言。其他之劇。如醉酒腰工之柔軟。表演之嫵媚。與乎玉堂春之繁重唱工。在在足以顯其佳處。尙有麻姑上壽。饅頭庵。奔月。散花等劇。每次出演時。繡帘啓處。彩聲如雷。可見艶芳之劇藝。確有號召能力矣。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（一五五）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十回　　赤燄騰天勾欄欽孝女　紅毹貼地即席晤名伶　　那個張氏味蓴園。也是一個人的花園。那個園主人張先生。是個常州人。曾經做過幾任道台在前清時代。最神秘的一種官僚。喚做道台。最萬能的一種官員。也是道台。從前單單是南京一處地方。候補道有好幾百員。因此又有人說。南京有三多。拐子多。驢子多。候補道多。做道台有紅有黑。當着闊差使的就是紅道台。什麽藩台臬台都趕不上他。一年功夫。幾十萬銀子擄了就走。黑的是黑透了頂。候補了十幾年。一點得不到什麽差使。弄得吃盡當光。連上衙門的袍褂都不周全。也是有的。而且道台又是隨便什麽本領都有。隨便什麽差使可當。文的如學道糧道。武的如兵備道。講到什麽洋務差使。也都座道台。那位園主人張先生。他也是一位道台。宦囊所得。便到上海來起了這是花園。也有人說他是被上司參了一本。壞官回來的。那也不去管他。總之他肯把這私人花園。公之同好。到他園裏來。並不要買票。不論什麽人。都可以跑進來。這倒有點平等色彩。他就有一座大洋房。與其說他是個花園。倒不如說他有這一個聚會的廳事。到他那座洋房裏坐坐。却照例要泡一碗茶。那堂倌便馬上端上幾個碟子來。瓜子花生糖。多少吃他一點。每碗茶收兩角錢。碟子只要五分。在近今的生活程度。一點也不算得貴。在那個時候。有幾位做人家朋友。寗可在大洋房的周圍踱踱方步。不敢走進裏面來。園主人遇着逢時逢節。或是在新年裏的幾天。或是在跑馬汛的時候。他自己在大洋房裏。監督着一班茶房堂倌。檢點有幾隻檯子泡茶。一共可以賣出多少茶。游客多的時候。每天賣出幾百碗茶。却是有的。在園主人也算是一種進欵。他而且春風滿面。什麽人都認得。好像在那裏當招待員一般。遇着了熟人。這一隻檯子上坐坐。那一隻檯子上坐坐。一路敷衍過來。尤其是堂子裏的姑娘。越是年紀大一點的。他越是認得了。必定跑過來敷衍幾句。他們自然也是張大人長。張大人短的和他絮聒。此外就是他把這座大洋房。借給人家開會。什麽大的會。都是開到張園去。什麽激　　　。都是開倒張園去。因爲上海除了這個張園外。　　調會合式的地方。</p>

<h3>紗花近期紗跌近五十兩</h3>
<p>▲厚積的底存···清淡的實需</p>

<p>紗市趨勢頗衰、以底貨漸厚、市上十支粗紗及一批呆貨銷路停頓、故買方雖極力設法、然終難支持、加之　局混沌大有延長之象、於是賣方胆氣愈壯、壓迫益力、故本月醞釀已久之紗價、現以月末期近、買方視大勢不佳、無意收貨、形勢殊劣、五十兩之關口、勢難維持、多數目標須四十六七兩、但有一疻分以底盤便宜、做多之念未絶云、</p>
<p>▲本月紗賣方備交慘跌兩六　人標前　市開盤、本月份以賣方準備交貨、而二十支五福牧羊及粗紗銷路缺乏、故市勢頗鬆、且倉庫中積貨日增、本月跌風尤熾、跌一兩三錢、遠跌四·六·八錢、午後本月份市氣頗軟、後以獲利者扒空回漲、結果本月跌三錢、遠漲一二錢、全日成交統計二萬一千一百包、茲將人標收號價錄左、</p>

<p>▲漢標近遠各跌二錢半、期棉前市開盤、外棉雖漲、然塲中賣氣較熾、本月交貨較多、市盤轉跌、本月一鬆、遠月牽動、各月均跌一錢五分至三錢、午後市况平疲、結果各月漲跌五分至一錢、全日成交統計四萬三千八百担、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>印英棉業週訊</h3>
<p>▲孟買　上週市價隨美棉上漲、本地心思傾向多頭、惟大體尙難維持、蓋比價一近、國外需要即减故也、目下輸出商之新交易數量雖不堅定、然因棉業保護令行將通過、出口商活動抵補、本地廠商自由購買、現貨需要非常暢達、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>
<p>前　週　　　上　週</p>
<p>九月一日起收數累計　　二、三九一　二、四七四</p>
<p>週末現存　　　　　　　一、三三二　一、二九八</p>

<p>輸往中國　　　　　　　一七五　　　二○一</p>
<p>輸往日本　　　　　　　六七九　　　七○六</p>
<p>其他各地　　　　　　　　三七　　　　三七</p>
<p>▲利物浦　上週現銷甚佳、期貨因銀行利率减低及銀價進步、多頭心思占勝、且萬國棉業聯合會之半年報告、其世界消費與普通所述之營業不佳、適相及背、故買方趨勢益堅、埃及棉爲市價所限、上落不定、</p>
<h3>糧食米市銷爽又漲</h3>
<p>▲頂白粳達二十元零五角···民食大堪注意　▲閘北　昨日市又上漲、裏路來船甚稀、本街銷塲趨爽、北粳頂高貨最少故行情達二十元零五角、普通中關大盤統提起角外、刻下河存漸薄、産銷兩地價時不划、際此靑黃不接之時、往後滬埠民食、殊深堪慮　本地走銷以粳米爲主、是以疊現新高價、薄稻有客帮問津、趨勢活潑、貨客一致喊緊羊杜秈因洋米猛漲、存到凋零、見漲一兩角不等、客埠秈需要亦殷、惟零胃不暢、價情跟好角譜、白元買氣尙平、各檔進意常淡、故無若何上落、</p>
<p>▲滬南　河下到船不旺、市銷在晨初極呆旋據閘訉報緊人心因此轉佳　常錫蘇同等粳初平繼堅約有一角出入鄕莊與客戶因現價太昻而觀望、但賣戶方面、因内地市挺而抬售、兼近有謠傳、謂某客帮在裏路暢購囤運、此說雖係空穴來風、然亦不爲無因、故貨客宗旨更堅、南帮各薄早稻、走銷較淡、來貨不厚、惟市價不易再上、羊杜秈此間實屬甚微、雖有少數運到、而洋米不漲斯米亦加價之勢、况銷化之爽俐耶、通變陰化與北市相彷、吊坯稍動、市無榮辱、</p>
<h3>期洋米升降靡定</h3>
<p>昨日洋米現化轉居平勢、因各帮辦意雖濃、乃聞有大額新到、多數觀望、統市祇有内地帮等辦去小絞二千包、價十四元六角至十四元五角二分、二號西貢五百包、價十五元一角七分期洋米上午開市後、有日新抛出四月份小絞七百噸、價六兩半、又敏當一千包、價六兩八錢、日新一抛、人心均爲望小、因數日來上漲之故、乃係洋行擯守、洋行旣出、回籠貨並見回小近錢、但除日新之外均無抛出、西商仍願收還、故至將晚時忽又回漲六七分、市面忽漲落、形呈盤旋之局、統市成交期米二千五百噸、小絞占多數云、</p>
<h3>標粉初平後高</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤時、以洋麥報價、芝加哥曾跌去五六角、坎拿大跌一元二三角、因此各月份開、價、大致平平、如四月份反較前週低去七厘半、惟以後各盤、則以人心已轉、提漲甚激、聞營口帮在市塲大買本月份、計其數量、約達二三萬而大廠方面、因抽碼已超過抛出之數、一轉移間、彷彿已爲多頭、投機者以環境已變、從事搶進者頗夥、故市面即步步俏利、及下午開盤、各方面以客胃期甚佳、廠家有軋空之象、人心激昻異常、本月份最高時曾招到二兩五錢六分、四月份至二兩五錢五分半、較前週收價、計漲二三分不等、旋以浮多回出、稍見低下、遠期各月份、因内地帮以米價高昻、爭買亦力、故亦帶高不少、惟聞天津帮又有直接定成三號洋粉黃牛牌二萬包價合申二兩一錢半、三井牌六萬包、價二兩一錢二分、故市面如果再昻、津帮銷塲、當不能接起矣、結果本月份較前週漲二分、四月份漲一分半、五月份好七厘半、六月份好一分、七月份好七厘半、八月份好五厘云、</p>
<h3>麥價近萎遠秀</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤時、各月份市面、呈近跌遠平之象、以江北已經開禁、兼之本月份因多空雙方之擠軋、大有非死即活之象、空方目下大致均預備現貨、故開價即見硬抑、最低時曾跌至五兩一錢六分、較前週計跌七分之巨、四月份亦跌三分、遠期則趨勢甚佳、均較提高、及下午開盤、本月份因交剿在邇、多頭不願脫手、（聞交割額約有六十餘連）粉市又佳仍亦回漲頗烈、遠期各月份、以内地帮買進、始終不懈、結果本月份較前週終小二分、四月份小一分、六七月份各較好二分、八月份好一分、現麥市况、以廠胃甚佳、市見挺住、開南宿州麥五兩一錢、清江浦麥五兩一錢、蚌埠麥五兩一錢、安慶麥五兩零七八分、五兩零五分、江西麥四兩六錢八分、四兩七錢、四兩八錢、四兩九錢六分、四兩九錢三分、湖南麥四兩六錢三分、共開三千餘包云、</p>
<h3>疋頭細斜粤厦甬紛辦暴騰</h3>
<p>▲本廠棉布　昨趨勢轉漲、尤以細斜爲甚、實以粤·厦甬·等帮、昨日均紛紛採辦、本街搜羅亦殷、以致現貨頓呈殆盡、開價莫不猛漲、陽鶴已須六兩九錢七分半、藍雙魚六兩六錢七分半、紅雙魚六兩五錢七分半、較前漲達一錢左右、細布染坯去路復暢、陽鶴四軍人藍雙魚彩球一致售六兩八錢、粗布形勢仍呆、九磅之貓英聚寳盆仍广四兩一錢半、十三磅貨跌五分、雙馬開五兩九錢、馬狗五兩九錢半、實銷長江流域及北方均靜、惟南華各帮反有進展之勢云、</p>
<p>▲東西疋頭　昨市亦略良好、東貨之直貢呢細嗶嘰直貢緞均回高二厘半、蓋以存底漸少、定價紛紛上漲、昨直貢呢中之莫干山獵雁慕秋均售二錢五分七厘半、雙童鹿亦呈上漲、細嗶嘰湖心亭秃藍灰又須二錢三分、歡樂雜色二錢二分七厘半、寳球二錢六分半、直貢緞以第一次最硬、開二錢四分七厘半、餘無變動、世樂鳥細布小二分半、售七兩五錢二分半、信號兵復漲、開八兩七錢、客銷長江帮仍靜、本街尙形活潑、西貨昨藍條冲蔴紗跌去五厘、白冲蔴紗亦小、素府綢現貨仍缺、素洋紗銷路日益進展云、</p>
<h3>俄莊開辦貢熙茶</h3>
<p>大衆注目之華茶對俄贸易　近來頗有逐漸恢復之趨勢　代理俄國辦茶之錦隆洋行、已接到莫斯科來電　對於貢熙綠茶、業已磋商就緒、日昨已向洪源永·源豐潤等茶棧、談成三千六百箱、扯價二十七兩、尙有大宗箱額、正在繼續談判上、此爲中俄絶交後之初次交易云、</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Cooperation Between the British Liberal Party and the Labour Party</h3>
<p>The role of a political party must be premised on the overall situation of the country. If it only competes for the private interests of one party, establishes the power of one party, and does not ask what its impact on the overall situation is, then the politics of that country must always be in a state of turmoil and confusion. The instability of the political situation in various countries in the world in recent years has mostly arisen from this. Even Japan, I am afraid, cannot avoid this. All dissatisfied political parties must devote all their efforts to attacking the ruling party, which is tantamount to devoting all their efforts to attacking the government. If there are any materials that can be used as an excuse, they must be thoroughly searched for my use in attacking. For example, the Seiyukai in Japan today is taking advantage of the opportunity of the decline of industry and commerce to attack the government's financial mistakes. But the attitude of the British Liberal Party is uniquely different from this.</p>
<p>It is well known that the Liberal Party in England cannot cooperate with the Labour Party. It is also well known that those who oppose the Labour Party government are trying to use the coal mine case to overthrow the government. But today, the Liberal Party suddenly expressed its cooperation with the Labour Party and no longer opposes government policies. As a result, the amendment proposed by the Conservative Party was rejected, allowing the government to resolve a major difficulty. The Liberal Party's reason for doing this was that the Five-Power Naval Conference was at a critical juncture, and the Liberal Party should not take actions that are detrimental to the government at this time, increasing the government's difficulties and putting it in a more humiliated position. Our party should not be responsible for overthrowing the cabinet at this time. In addition, with world industrial and commercial trade in a state of decline, it does not want to cause disturbances with another general election, making the people feel even more uneasy. The reason why it no longer opposes the government's coal mine policy and intends to cooperate with the Labour Party is for this reason. This can also be said to be able to fulfill the responsibilities of a political party.</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch, if the two parties can indeed cooperate, then the political crisis will certainly take a turn for the better. The election in May of this year may not be held. The government's life can be extended for at least two years. MacDonald can also handle domestic and foreign affairs with a free hand to make up for today's situation. It is truly fortunate for the British government. I believe that if all countries with political party politics in the world can take the overall situation of the country as the premise like the British Liberal Party, the image of political turmoil and instability will surely be reduced day by day.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Zhu Shaoliang Assassinated</h3>
<p>The Assassin Fired a Shot and Was Immediately Arrested</p>
<p>Hand Grenade Explodes at the Eighth Route Army Field Headquarters</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) In Zhu Shaoliang's bedroom at the Wudanan Hotel in Hong Kong, a person suddenly came on the 19th and fired a shot at Zhu from outside the room but missed. The assassin was arrested on the spot. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A worker at the Eighth Route Army Field Headquarters in Hong Kong accidentally triggered a hand grenade on the 22nd, killing and injuring several soldiers and laborers. The rear building was destroyed. Chen Jitang was unharmed. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Recently, the central government telegraphed Guangdong to first clear out the Gui army in the south and then attack Xun and Yong. There will be no major battles in the Dahe within ten days. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Polish Representative Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Negotiating Commercial Treaty Issues</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Polish Chargé d'Affaires to China, Weidengtao, and the Counselor, Guo Texinski, arrived in Nanjing on the 24th. In the afternoon, they went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit Hu Boze, the Director of the Asian Department. According to Weidengtao, the full text of the Sino-Polish Commercial Treaty concerning the previous explanations by both parties has been mailed to Warsaw. The Polish government has telegraphed its agreement on the points that are easier to resolve. However, the most important points may not be detailed enough in the telegram and must be notified in writing before they can be confirmed. Therefore, it is not yet known whether the Polish government fully agrees. It is said that Wei and Hu have agreed to meet again on the 25th to discuss matters unrelated to the Sino-Polish Commercial Treaty. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang's Troops Pursue Zhu and Mao</h3>
<p>Zhu and Mao Appear to be Fleeing to Jinggang</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Ganzhou was relieved on the 22nd. Zhu and Mao fled to Xingguo Xinfeng Shangyou separately, and Zhang's troops are pursuing. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The provincial government issued a notice offering a reward of 50,000 yuan for the capture of Zhu and Mao alive, and 30,000 yuan for killing them. The Xin Jian, Min Zu, and other four warships are patrolling the Gan River. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Huizhan recently telegraphed Nanjing that he arrived in Xiajiang on the 21st. He heard that the bandits were rampant in the Longfu and Fukou areas of Jishui. He ordered Tang Yunshan and Deng Ying's two brigades to each send a unit to attack them from both sides, and personally led his troops to Jishui to supervise the suppression. Zhu Cheng's two brigades, which were previously sent to Ganzhou to reinforce, have reached the line of Taihe and Madaozhou. Zhu and Mao appear to be fleeing to Suichuan towards the old lair of Jinggang. Peng Dehuai's troops are currently attacking Yuanzhou and Fenyi, and Deng's brigade has been ordered to rush to suppress them. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) There is news that the garrison in Ganzhou is about to move out. Foreigners, feeling that the situation is dangerous and that their lives and property may be in danger, have requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to telegraph the headquarters, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Jiangxi Provincial Government to order the garrison to postpone the departure temporarily to reassure them. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs approved Jiangxi Province's telegram stating that the province is currently carrying out a large-scale bandit suppression, and it is very inconvenient for foreigners to travel. Please order all passport-issuing agencies to temporarily stop issuing passports, and those who have already obtained passports should be notified not to go to the unrest areas to avoid danger. A circular has been issued to all passport-issuing agencies for unified notification. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhao Daiwen's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Peiping) The Peiping Evening News carried a letter from Taiyuan, in which Zhao Daiwen said, "Anyone with a little insight can see the cause and effect of this change. There is discord between Shanxi and the central government.</p>
<p>Yan loves the people, but the result is that he cannot fully love them. Yan values thrift and frugality, but the result is that he wastes money in useless places and cannot change this. This is what we can sigh about. When Huanzhang left, the deputy commander took 3 million as his wealth, and asked him to consider the lives of the people of Shanxi and Shaanxi.</p>
<p>As for the Northwest side, Liu Yufen's faction was not initially pro-war. However, Lu Ruibo and others were unwilling to hide their talents, so this change occurred. Judging from the circumstances, Zhang Hanqing has no reason to throw himself into the vortex. In short, not everyone is crazy. How can a soldier who wears armor be happy with chaos? In the current situation, there are often exaggerated words,</p>
<p>etc."</p>
<p>(24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to reliable information from a certain source, Zhao Daiwen, the former president of the Control Yuan, strongly advocated supporting the central government at the Taiyuan meeting and was opposed by the pro-war faction, who even demanded that Yan Xishan expel Zhao from the country. Yan, considering his years of following, did not agree. Zhao was spared from disaster, but Zhao has not dared to speak since then and has closed his doors to guests, not asking about current affairs. (24th Electric News Agency)</p>
<h3>Authority of the Plenipotentiary Representative of the Sino-Russian Conference</h3>
<p>Not Limited to the Chinese Eastern Railway Issue</p>
<p>(Harbin) Because the National Government has issued an order giving the Chinese Plenipotentiary to the Sino-Russian formal conference broad powers beyond the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Deputy Consul of Labor and Agriculture in Harbin, Mr. Melnikov, has requested instructions from the Moscow government regarding the opening of the Sino-Russian formal conference. (23rd Japan Federation News Agency)</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Board of Directors and Supervisors of the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) Harbin telegram: Today, the Chinese Eastern Railway held a joint meeting of the Board of Directors and Supervisors, deciding to raise various issues of the Chinese Eastern Railway in the Sino-Russian conference. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Harbin telegram: More than sixty Chinese employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway's telegraph bureau have lost their jobs due to the restoration of the original state. The telegraph authorities are seeking ways to resettle them. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Committee Holds a Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Disaster Relief Committee held its second meeting on the 24th and resolved: (1) To send a letter to the Ministry of Finance, urging it to allocate 800,000 yuan in treasury bonds designated for the Henan Provincial Government as soon as possible. After they are received and cashed, they will be handed over to Committee Member Li Huanying to handle emergency relief and immigration matters together with the Henan Provincial Disaster Relief Association. (2) The 10 million yuan in disaster relief public bonds approved for allocation by this committee should be contacted with the Ministry of Finance immediately to be allocated as soon as possible, or a portion should be allocated first for disaster relief. (3) To contact the Ministry of Finance to handle the special cement tax to supplement disaster relief funds. (4) To organize a fundraising committee to raise disaster relief funds at home and abroad. (5) Water Committee Member Zi proposed to use the Boxer Indemnity as collateral and quickly borrow 20 million yuan in foreign debt to be used for disaster relief. The proposal was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Central Supervisory Committee Held a Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Supervisory Committee held a meeting at 2:00 PM on the 24th. Gu Yingfen, Wang Chonghui, Enke Batu, and others attended. More than twenty proposals were passed. The content has not been announced. (24th)</p>
<h3>Wu Chaochu's Views on the Nationality Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wu Chaochu expressed his views at the International Law Compilation Conference, advocating that Country A should still be able to provide diplomatic protection to its dual nationals in Country B. His intention is that there are a large number of overseas Chinese in foreign countries, their language and culture are the same as their mother country, and they have always considered themselves Chinese. China considers them compatriots and provides protection. The local government often tacitly recognizes them as Chinese and applies special laws. If it is said that it is close to infringing on the sovereignty of Country B, then it can be seen that in recent years, there have been international agreements protecting minority ethnic groups. The reason is similar to our proposal. There are now a large number of overseas Chinese in foreign countries, often more than the local population. Compared with protecting minority ethnic groups, the reason is even more sufficient. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>International Labour Organization Congress Our Country Plans to Draft Proposals</h3>

<p>International Telegrams</p>
<h3>Indian Female Volunteers Participate in Anti-British Movement</h3>
<p>Led by Mrs. Gandhi</p>
<p>Youth from All Over Respond Enthusiastically</p>
<p>The Government's Prestige Has Been Overwhelmed</p>
<p>▲Reuters News Agency, Baffa, 23rd. Gandhi arrived here today. In response to a question from Ms. Charles Bardyaya, a well-known social worker, Gandhi said that she did not want women to abandon their children, but women who can take good care of their children should also join the non-violent resistance movement. Ms. Charles is now planning to travel around the Mumbai area to recruit two groups of female volunteers, one group to be responsible for active non-violent resistance work, and the other group to be responsible for propaganda work. It is reported that Mrs. Gandhi will lead the first batch of 37 female volunteers from the Gandhi Ashram to Bolsa by train and then to Titel to resist the salt tax.</p>
<p>▲Reuters News Agency, Kolkata, 22nd. Throughout Bengal Province, meetings are being held to recruit non-violent resistance volunteers. Several young people have gone from Tripura to Midnapore, willing to manufacture salt on the coast near Contai. Recently, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Hora Municipal Council near Kolkata have registered as volunteers.</p>
<p>▲Reuters News Agency, Mumbai area, Baloch, 23rd. Gandhi's subordinates now have the impression that the Indian government's prestige is gradually declining. There are two reasons for this impression. One is the punishment received by Kolkata Mayor Sangupupta. The authorities detained the mayor for making inflammatory speeches three weeks ago and sent him to Yangon, accusing him of treason, but the court only sentenced him to ten days in prison. The second is the remarks made by Hester, the government's financial member, in the Legislative Council regarding the salt tax. Hester claimed that the Indian government has decided to submit the entire salt tax issue to the Tariff Commission for review in order to supply the public with the best salt at the lowest price. Gandhi himself also said in a speech in Baffa that the government now has signs of decadence, and it is regrettable that the village chiefs of Baffa are unwilling to cooperate. Are the village chiefs afraid of the government? Although he openly came out to break the government's laws and made激昂 speeches against the government, the government was afraid and did not dare to detain him. The village chiefs, in view of the punishment received by Sangupupta, can't they see the strength and weakness of the current government compared to the government of 1857 or 1919? He leads eighty volunteers, and the government still does not dare to touch him. If he had eighty thousand people, how would the government dare to detain him? I hope that Hindus and Muslims, men and women, will join together without fear, because the success of this movement lies in the reduction of the tax burden. Provincial leaders consulted Gandhi on methods of non-violent resistance. Gandhi replied today that if the government does not detain volunteers and focuses on obstruction, the non-violent resistance movement must be extended indefinitely.</p>
<h3>Major British Parties Initially Tend to Cooperate</h3>
<p>The Entire Political Situation Will Change</p>
<p>The Current Government's Life Expectancy Can Be Extended</p>
<p>▲Reuters News Agency, London, 23rd. According to newspaper observations, the Labour Party and the Liberal Party have taken the first step towards cooperation between the two parties. The Liberal Party's no longer opposing the government's coal mining bill is a sign of cooperation between the two parties. If the two parties do have contact, the entire political situation will change, and there may not be a general election in May this year. With the consent of the Liberal Party, the current government's life expectancy will be extended by at least two years. The content of the contact is currently kept secret. Roughly before the next general election, Parliament must pass an election system reform bill to give the Liberal Party better opportunities to participate in politics. With the government's life extended, Prime Minister McDonald will preside over the next Imperial Conference, and the public interest can also be greatly benefited, because the national politics will not be confused by holding elections after the publication of the Simon Commission's report on the investigation of the Indian Constitution. The Sunday Times also stated that the Labour Party and the Liberal Party have reached an understanding. If the government can pass its coal mining bill, the Liberal Party's complaints about the election system will definitely receive the government's sympathetic consideration. If the coal mining bill is passed, the government's administrative procedures during this parliamentary term, although there may be controversial points, can also be smooth sailing without obstacles along the way.</p>
<p>▲Reuters News Agency, London, 22nd. British Prime Minister MacDonald wrote to the electoral district, stating that he intends for the current parliament to be maintained for at least two years, but the Labour Party's majority power in parliament is not sufficient, so he cannot make a final statement on this. The Labour government has great administrative procedures and will continue to proceed unless the opposition obstructs what the government considers to be most beneficial to the country. However, the people of the country do not want to be disturbed by the general election at a time when world trade is萧索.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Plans to Shift from Passive to Active</h3>
<p>Financial Resources Depleted and Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Exports and Worrying Future</p>
<p>▲Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 24th. The Japanese government has recently realized the necessity of reversing the recession and plans to abolish the publicity of consumption and frugality, replacing it with the promotion of domestic products. For unemployment relief, local governments are allowed to issue bonds. At the same time, they are painstakingly working on price maintenance measures and domestic industrial protection and promotion. A part of the world believes that the current cabinet will shift from a passive policy to an active policy, so they hope that this shift method will be realized when compiling the six-year budget. If so, where will the financial resources come from? Issue government bonds? Increase new taxes? Radically reorganize finances to free up surplus financial resources? One of the three must be the case. However, the current cabinet has always adhered to the principle of not borrowing, and issuing government bonds is absolutely impossible. And at this time of recession, it is also impossible to establish new taxes. As a result, the only thing left is to reorganize administrative finances. However, according to recent reorganization, it is impossible to free up a large amount of surplus. If the London Conference is successful, naval expenses can be reduced considerably, but it has been decided to use it to reduce consumption tax. The only thing that is somewhat expected is the army reorganization. However, because it concerns national defense, it may not be possible to decisively reduce expenses. Therefore, although the government recognizes the necessity of shifting to an active policy, due to financial difficulties, there is no hope of realizing it for the time being, or it may continue with a passive approach.</p>
<p>▲Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 24th. The Mars Society of the Marquis Group of the House of Peers will hold a regular meeting on the 4th of next month and invite Interior Minister Adachi to attend to explain the government's unemployment countermeasures and election reform policies. The majority opinion of the Society is that although the gradual decline in prices and the reduction in trade deficits due to the deep recession are welcome phenomena, at the same time, the export side has also decreased significantly, which is an undeniable fact. If this is allowed to continue, Japan's future is worrying.</p>
<h3>US Trade with the Far East Last Year</h3>
<p>Total Amount Reached 2 Billion US Dollars</p>
<p>▲Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 24th. The US Commercial Officer announced the results of Far East trade in 1929. Although the situation in various countries in the Far East is not good, the trade volume still reached 2 billion US dollars, and added that the major economic changes that occurred in various countries in the Far East in 1929 were: (1) The increase in Chinese tariffs, (2) The adoption of austerity policies in Japan, (3) Dr. Kemmerer's Chinese financial improvement, (4) The sharp drop in silver prices, (5) The lifting of Japan's gold export ban, (6) The revision of the Philippine banking law, (7) The adoption of the gold standard in China and India, etc. Among them, Dr. Kemmerer's Chinese financial improvement plan, according to the current situation in China and the low silver price, has little possibility of being realized. The adoption of the Chinese gold standard, which is the main focus of the Kemmerer plan, is just an ideal and has no possibility of being realized at all.</p>

<h3>US Oil Company Fraud Case</h3>
<p>Under Investigation</p>
<p>▲Associated Press, Los Angeles, 23rd. The local authorities are currently busy searching for new evidence in the Jolin Oil Company case, fearing that important figures in Southern California and the Far East may be summoned to testify. The focus of the investigation is currently on the $35 million fraud. It is found that when Mrs. Lewis, the director of the company, traveled around the world in previous years, it coincided with the large-scale sale of the company's over-issued stocks, so it is expected that this money may be related to Mrs. Lewis's trip. It is heard that Mrs. Lewis carried a large sum of money in her luggage and stayed at the Majestic Hotel in Shanghai for a long time in December 1926 and January of the following year. However, whether this money was disposed of in Shanghai or other Far Eastern ports is still under investigation. According to the local prosecutor, the investigation of this case will take several weeks to complete.</p>

All were expelled from the party. 5.

<h3>Closure of the Tianjin Republic Daily</h3>
<p>▲The North China Daily in Peiping Suffers the Same Destruction</p>
<p>Tianjin dispatch from the Central News Agency: The Tianjin Republic Daily, directly under the Central Propaganda Department, officially began publication on December 1st of last year. Its daily editorials and records were all devoted to upholding the Central Government and maintaining unity and peace. After Yan Xishan's telegrams were published, the newspaper upheld justice and criticized Yan's accusations. When telegrams from Shang Zhen, Lu Zhonglin, and others were released, clearly rebelling against the Central Government, the newspaper published forceful editorials against them, sparing no effort. As a result, it incurred the disfavor of the local military and political authorities in the city. On the afternoon of the 19th, at 1 PM, the city government sent a letter ordering Zhang Xiangding, Cui Ruhong, and others to the newspaper, where they sealed up all the machinery and public property and then took it over. The newspaper, believing that it was fighting for justice and would not avoid any sacrifice, was unable to resist and was forcibly taken over. The newspaper immediately telegraphed the Central Government to report everything and published advertisements in various newspapers, describing the circumstances of being ordered to cease publication and declaring that if anyone used the newspaper's name for counter-revolutionary propaganda, all circles should not be deceived.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<h3>Memorial Week at the Central Government and National Government</h3>
<p>▲ Central Party Headquarters: At 9:00 AM on the 24th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 52nd weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in the Grand Auditorium. Central Committee members Sun Ke, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Lifu, Chen Yao, and others, as well as officials from various departments and guests, totaling about 500 people, attended. Chairman Sun Ke presided over the ceremony, after which Shao Yuanchong delivered a political report, broadly stating that recently reactionary forces have colluded and exploited each other, attempting to resist the Central Government. All comrades recognize that this is significantly related to the security of the Party and the nation and that work should be intensified to cope with it. However, this is a temporary problem, and it is necessary to quickly resolve it with the power of the Party. At the same time, more attention must be paid to the fundamental problems of the country, that is, the problem of people's livelihood, which the Premier's Founding Program and the Three Principles of the People emphasize first. There must be a good solution to stabilize the lives of the general public. To stabilize the lives of the people, it is necessary to work hard on economic construction and not stop or abandon its basic work due to temporary changes, which would hinder the implementation of political tutelage. The most important basic works during the period of political tutelage are economic construction, local autonomy, education of the Three Principles of the People, and mass training, frugality campaigns, etc. No matter how the environment changes and how difficult it is, if we can continue to work hard with a consistent spirit, then even if reactionary facts continue to occur, the foundation of the Party will never be shaken. In the scope of economic construction, agriculture, industry, and transportation must all have considerable development, but it is especially important to recognize agriculture as the mother of industry and commerce, and strive to improve it to increase production, so that the economy can avoid lagging behind. The American industrial sector is less complex than the British one, and disputes do not occur because American agriculture is developed and can accommodate a large number of workers, allowing them to live a stable life. Because the industrial sector has a considerable solution to its own livelihood, it is unwilling to change. China has been established on agriculture since ancient times. According to the current social situation, the starting point for political and economic construction must be the development of agriculture, so that the productive capacity of each person can maintain the life of one person, and the natural production can be developed and circulated as much as possible, so as to conform to the ancient training of adapting to and using resources for the benefit of the people, and gradually achieve the goal of the principle of people's livelihood. As for the two words "respect virtue," absolute attention should also be paid, so that the society and the public can cultivate their morality, seek benefits for the public, and make knowledge and culture progress day by day, so as to lead the improvement of economic undertakings and satisfy the desires of the people's lives. In this way, the disadvantages of treating the head when it hurts and treating the foot when it hurts can be avoided. The purpose of the Principle of People's Livelihood is to nourish the people, which is different from the purpose of capitalism to make profits. It must be good at using it so that capitalism does not become imperialism, and the Principle of People's Livelihood does not become capitalism. For thousands of years, China has been governed and disordered alternately. The main reasons are all due to the influence of the problem of people's livelihood, which leads to changes. Now the people suffer from famine, war, and harsh taxes, which make them unable to live. It is all too common to see this. Most of the spirit should be used to solve this fundamental problem, so that the people can recuperate, which is the true ability and performance of party members to serve the country, society, and people. I hope all comrades will work hard, and so on. The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>▲ National Government: At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held a weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, He Yingqin, Chen Yi, Zhou Yawei, Liu Ruiheng, Jiang Menglin, Li Jinlun, Zhang Wohua, and others, as well as all the staff of the Civil Affairs Office and the Military Affairs Office, totaling more than 200 people, attended. Chairman Tan Yankai presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, Secretary Qian Changzhao delivered a political report as follows: [There is a widespread movement in the Far East, which is worth paying attention to, that is, the national self-determination movement. Last October in India, the Governor-General of India issued a speech on Indian autonomy, and the gradually spreading independence movement was slightly broken, but after the National Congress, the situation became tense again. Recently, the relationship between Britain and India has deteriorated, and non-violent resistance has already begun. It is difficult to predict the outcome. In Korea last November, the Gwangju student riots were tense. Japan established an autonomous educational system through the Governor-General of Korea to create a harmonious atmosphere. In January of this year, workers joined the resistance, and the general Korean people were extremely激昂. The independence movement will continue. The Philippine independence issue has become increasingly heated since this year. Last month, the Independence Congress issued a declaration listing fourteen reasons, separately explaining that the United States must immediately allow the Philippines to be completely independent. It is not easy for the United States to deal with this time. It is still unknown whether it can be recovered. In Vietnam this year, the revolutionary voice is quite high. According to news from Paris, many revolutionaries have been sentenced to death. The high-pressure means of France may not be able to solve it thoroughly. We know that Britain and India, Japan and Korea, the United States and the Philippines, and France and Vietnam all have major political and economic relations. A change will not only cause local problems, but also cause problems in the Far East. Not only will problems occur in the Far East, but also in the whole world. Brothers personally speculate that the independence movements in India, Korea, the Philippines, and Vietnam have arisen, although they have occurred at different times, and if they succeed, they will succeed at the same time, because as long as one place succeeds, the others will definitely be like a storm, and they cannot be cleaned up. The Pacific War may occur because of this. It is important to know that some of the so-called independence movements are completely automatic, some are automatic and need the secret assistance of another country's power, and some are completely passive and controlled by another country. Complete automation is a very good expression of national spirit. Automation and the need for assistance from other countries are quite dangerous. As for being completely passive and controlled by another country, it is like driving away the tiger from the front door and letting the wolf in from the back door, which is extremely dangerous. We hope that the national self-determination in the Far East is completely automatic, but now the countries chasing deer in the Pacific are suspicious of each other and guard against each other. None of Britain, Japan, the United States, and France are willing to relax a little, and their important colonies are demanding independence, regardless of whether there is a third party instigating them, they always think that other countries are making trouble there. Since the interests are significant, it is possible to take this opportunity to cause a war. If the Pacific does not have a war, it is over. If a war occurs, our country will be in the middle of it and will have to make sacrifices. Therefore, today, when we talk about the national self-determination movement in the Far East, we should also arouse the attention of our compatriots. Recently, Feng and Yan have cooperated, and at the same time, they have used all means to contact all kinds of reactionaries to make trouble. This rebellion is very large in scope. For them, it is the last struggle, and for the Central Government, it is also the key to the success of the revolution. After this rebellion, the people of the whole country can understand that the Central Government's aim is peace. Until it is absolutely necessary, we will not use force. After this, we can let everyone know that the most recent object of the revolution is the feudal warlords. After this rebellion, the revolutionary comrades can be more united. After this rebellion, the foundation of the Party and the country can be absolutely consolidated, and there will be no more rebellions in the future. As for the Central Government's attitude towards this rebellion, Chairman Chiang has made a solemn statement at the memorial week last Monday, that is, to be steady and persevering, to control the situation with inaction, and to clean up the overall situation with great certainty. What is worrying is that the people of the whole country are affected by the rebellion and still cannot live and work in peace. They indirectly sacrifice for the revolution. After the government puts down the rebellion, the only most important task is to reduce the burden and suffering of the people. This is not just empty talk. In fact, if the people are not appeased, the vitality of the society will never be restored, and the revolution will never succeed. Everyone who hears about the death of Mr. Liang Zhongjia mourns for him. Last time, when the Russian army invaded the border, Mr. Liang took the lead and risked his life to defend the country and protect the people. In the midst of great difficulties, he still wrote to his friends, saying that whoever dares to lose an inch of land will not see his countrymen. His sacrifice to foreign countries can be a model for soldiers. Now that the Sino-Russian negotiations have come to an end, Mr. Liang has suddenly passed away. It is probably due to the mental stimulation and physical pain of the past year that led to this. Mr. Liang has been in office for more than ten years and has not acquired any property. After his death, he was desolate, and his grandmother and father had no one to support them, and his children were still underage. The government should give him preferential treatment and condolences. However, the death of Mr. Liang has become a major loss to our country. I only hope that the compatriots of the whole country will work hard to strengthen themselves so that the imperialists can no longer trample on us. Then, Mr. Liang can be comforted in the afterlife.]</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Troops Withdraw from Guide</h3>
<p>A communication from Xuzhou on the 22nd stated that Sun Dianying's troops had suddenly moved. Han Fuju requested the Central Government to thoroughly resolve the issue and telegraphed Liu Zhi, requesting him to send troops to assist in the suppression to achieve the effect of a pincer attack.</p>
<p>As for the Sun's troops on the western route, they had already surrendered their weapons ahead of schedule. Gu, under pressure, sent his representative, Chen Tao, from Guide to Xuzhou on the evening of the 20th to personally visit Liu Zhi and ask him to intercede with the Central Government, expressing his willingness to comply with the order to gather his troops on the north bank of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>However, he requested a delay and asked him to forward a telegram to Han Fuju, asking him not to attack again. Liu agreed to forward the message on his behalf. Chen returned to Guide at noon on the 21st to report. However, on that day, clashes occurred between Sun's troops and Han's troops between Lanfeng and Shangqiu, and they refused to move their defense.</p>
<p>The two sides fought fiercely for half a day. Sun's troops were defeated and hurriedly withdrew from Guide that night, retreating towards Tuocheng, Taikang, Luyi, and Zhoukou, intending to cross the Pinghan Line and retreat towards Fangcheng and Nanyang in western Henan.</p>
<p>It was learned that there was no trace of Sun's troops in Guide.</p>
<p>This morning, Liu Zhi sent Liang Huasheng's division of four regiments and the Great Wall armored train from Xuzhou West to Dangshan and Muma 集.</p>
<p>In pursuit, the Longhai Railway Bureau also dispatched an engineer today to carry materials and opened a special train to Liu Diquan to rush to repair the railway. It is expected to be completed within a few days, and the transportation between Xuzhou and Bian will be restored. (Zhonghua News Agency)</p>
<h3>Arrested Provincial Committee Members in Fujian Completely Sent to the Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>A communication from Fuzhou stated that the arrested provincial government members, Cheng Shijun, Xu Xianshi, and Wu Shu, the director of the Maritime Public Security Bureau, were escorted from Yanping to the provincial capital on March 10 and resided in the old ordnance factory in Huangdian. After that, the three provincial government members detained in Youxi, Chen Naiyuan, Zheng Baojing, and Lin Zhiyuan, were also sent to the provincial capital by Wan'an steamship on the 17th and also resided in the ordnance factory in Huangdian. According to the original plan, the six arrested people have been completely sent to the provincial capital and should be sent to Nanjing by Chen Jiliang to ask the Central Government to handle them. Then, the National Government will issue an order to reorganize the provincial government. It is now heard that Lu Xingbang intends to move the six people from the old ordnance factory in Huangdian to the western-style building of the Youth Association summer camp in nearby Hongshan, so that their daily lives can be more comfortable and their families can be allowed to visit them to dispel rumors. After the provincial government is reorganized, they will be sent to Nanjing again. On the 18th, Chen Jiliang and Lu's advisor, Yang Yugu, and Zhang Qun's representative, Guo Shihui, consulted on the Chutong warship in Taijiang. Chen intended to temporarily move the six people to the Chutong warship or the Majiang Naval Social Center, protected by the Navy, to observe the situation and then send them to Nanjing for handling. Yang Yugu telegraphed Lu Xingbang for instructions. Once the reply is received, a decision can be made. As for Liu Heding's 56th Division, which was ordered by the General Headquarters to advance from Quanzhou to the provincial capital, the vanguard of Gui Zhenyuan's brigade has arrived in Fuqing County, near the province, from Putian. Liu Shangzhi's brigade has also arrived in Yongtai from Xianyou, and the governments of the two counties have been ordered to prepare for the application of porters. Chen Jiliang telegraphed Liu Heding yesterday, reporting that the five provincial committee members had all arrived in the province, and the provincial situation had been completely resolved. The defense of the provincial capital has two regiments of the Marine Corps, Huang Maohe and Lin Bingzhou, which are sufficient to maintain it. Please keep your troops stationed in Xingquan to secure the downstream security. It is still unknown whether Liu's troops will stop advancing. (March 19)</p>
<h3>Liu Heding Marches into Putian</h3>
<p>▲ His Troops, Liu's Brigade, Have Reached Yongtai and Fuqing</p>
<p>A communication from Xiamen stated that after the 56th Division concentrated in Quanzhou, the 167th Brigade, Liu Shangzhi's troops, marched to Putian, and the 168th Brigade, Gui Zhenyuan's troops, marched to Huian. It was originally planned to advance separately to Yongtai, Fuqing, Datian, and Youxi. Later, they received an order from the provincial government to stop advancing at the original locations, because at that time Lu Xingbang was agreeing to send the five provincial committee members back to the province to await the Central Government's decision. Liu's troops immediately complied with the order to stop advancing at the above-mentioned locations, but they still made mobilization preparations in Quanzhou, Huian, and Putian. On the 16th of this month, Liu Heding, the division commander, ordered the special service battalion, artillery battalion, cavalry battalion, and signal squadron to set off completely from Luoyang and enter Huian. At 5:00 PM, he bid farewell to all circles in Quanzhou, stating during the banquet that he would go to the front to supervise his troops. On the morning of the 17th, Liu led the entire division headquarters and guards to set off for Huian. According to news from the division headquarters, Liu's first step was to station in Putian to command. The division headquarters also stationed in Putian. Liu Shangzhi's brigade, which had originally arrived in Putian, also set off on the 16th and advanced towards Yongtai and Fuqing. Gui Zhenyuan's brigade simultaneously advanced from Huian towards Putian. It was heard that after arriving in Putian, they would advance towards Datian and Youxi. The 332nd regiment of Chen Wantai's 166th Brigade, which was stationed in Quanzhou, was originally sent to the outside of the South Gate on the 13th to join the Jinjiang County magistrate to eradicate the tobacco seedlings. It was also transferred back on the 16th and concentrated in Luoyang. It will continue to open Huian and Putian, leaving only Chen Wantai to lead the 331st regiment to guard Quanzhou. Liu's advance this time was extremely rapid. According to the latest telegram from Quanzhou, the vanguard of Liu's brigade has arrived in Yongtai and Fuqing and is advancing towards the provincial capital. As for the five provincial committee members, Xu Xianshi, Cheng Shijun, Lin Zhiyuan, Chen Naiyuan, Zheng Baojing, and Wu Shu, the director of the Maritime Public Security Bureau, they arrived in the province on the 10th and 17th respectively. Chen Jiliang heard that the vanguard of Liu's division had arrived in Yongtai and Fuqing and telegraphed Liu Heding on the 19th, asking him to stop advancing temporarily and not to enter the province rashly. However, whether Liu's division will temporarily station in Putian or still enter the province depends on how the provincial situation develops. (March 21)</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Government's Plan to Maintain Coastal Security</h3>
<p>▲ Will Purchase Four Gunboats and Recruit More Maritime Police</p>
<p>▲ Send Chen Luanshu and Others to Cooperate with Ge and Shen on Solutions</p>
<p>A communication from Qingdao stated that the Shandong Provincial Government, because the coastline of this province extends to more than 2,000 miles, all matters such as maritime security and fishery protection have been lacking. In recent years, piracy has been rampant, and Japanese people often cross the border to fish. Without appropriate measures, maritime security will not be maintained. Recently, Chen Luanshu and Zhu Xi, two provincial committee members, were specially sent to Qingdao to discuss cooperation solutions with Qingdao Mayor Ge Jing'en and Navy Commander Shen Honglie. The result was very satisfactory. Chen and Zhu have already returned to Ji'nan last night. It is heard that the provincial government intends to use 1.5 million yuan for maritime security in the 19th year, first purchasing four gunboats, establishing a maritime public security bureau, and recruiting more maritime police, which is currently in progress.</p>
<p>Northeast Navy Commander Shen Honglie recently came to Qingdao on the Zhaowei warship and thoroughly discussed the joint defense methods of the Navy and Army with Mayor Ge Jing'en. He then took the original ship to Laoshan Bay on the 16th to inspect the ships belonging to the First Fleet. It is heard that Shen believes that the situation is tense and maritime defense is particularly important. He specially convened the captains of each ship at the office of the First Fleet in Laoshan Bay at 2:00 PM today to hold a maritime defense meeting. The heads of the Marine Corps battalion stationed in Qingdao were also ordered to participate in advance. It is heard that the matters discussed were divided into two items: (1) Measures to maintain coastal security; (2) Eliminate pirates within a time limit to consolidate maritime defense. (20th)</p>
<h3>Tragic Fire at a Cinema in Jilin</h3>
<p>▲ Seventy or Eighty Male and Female Bodies Have Been Recovered</p>
<p>▲ More Than One Hundred People Were Injured and Countless Are Missing</p>
<p>A communication from Shenyang stated that the provincial government received a telegram from Jilin, stating that at 8:00 PM on the 18th, when the Jiyong Cinema in Dadongmen, Jilin Province, was showing a film, a fire suddenly broke out from the film and spread throughout the entire cinema. The entire audience was in chaos, and men, women, old, and young cried out for help. Because the projector was located right at the gate and the cinema did not have an emergency exit, the audience had no way to escape. The police team of the Public Security Bureau received the news and rushed to the rescue, but because the fire was caused by electricity, it was not easy to extinguish. In an instant, the entire cinema was burned to ashes. On the 19th, seventy or eighty male and female bodies were recovered from the ashes. It was heard that there were 152 people burned at the time, and countless people were missing. Most of the dead were upstairs audiences, including Lu, the director of the Jilin Public Security Bureau, and the entire family of a section chief of the Military Law Department of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Border Defense Army, and Rong's second wife of the Finance Department of the Jilin Provincial Government. It was found that the cinema had only been open for three months, and its entire building was a simple plank wall, so it was easy to catch fire. (20th)</p>
<h3>Quick Letter from Wuhu</h3>
<p>▲ Since the 154th Brigade of the 52nd Division was transferred away from Wuhu, the local security has been jointly maintained by the Public Security Brigade, which is composed of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce Regiment, and the County Self-Defense Corps, together with the warships stationed in Wuhu. A few days ago, the Chuguan warship was ordered to go to Nanjing again. Sun, the county magistrate of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, telegraphed the provincial government to report. Chairman Cheng has replied that the defense of Wuhu has been telegraphed to the Commander-in-Chief to send another warship to take over.</p>
<p>▲ The butchering tax and various donations belonging to Wuhu City have now been taken over by the Municipal Preparatory Office. However, the miscellaneous grain donation is still handled by the provincial government. The Municipal Office believes that local donations should be used for local construction. In addition to requesting the provincial government to allocate funds, it also sent a letter to the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce, asking it to strive for it together.</p>
<p>▲ About thirty shops in Doumen Lane to Ningyuan Guan in Wuhu City have encroached on official ditches. The Municipal Office ordered them to be demolished to expand the streets. Since yesterday, the shops have been demolishing them on their own. The Municipal Office also announced that all houses encroaching on official roads and official ditches on the two streets will be ordered to relocate within a time limit.</p>
<p>▲ Recently, disaster victims from Henan have come to Anhui or transferred to other places to beg for food in groups, and the number is very large. The Anhui Provincial Government believes that it hinders local security and specially ordered all counties yesterday that when these disaster victims pass through the border, they should be sent back to their hometowns immediately and should not be allowed to stay.

<p>Important News 2</p>
<h3>Qingdao Municipal Government Implements Streamlining</h3>
<p>▲ Consolidating Nine Bureaus into Five</p>
<p>Since Qingdao was officially designated as a special municipality by the National Government, the former acting mayor, Wu Siyu, established nine bureaus in accordance with the organizational law of special municipalities: Finance, Land, Education, Public Works, Public Utilities, Port Affairs, Public Security, Social Affairs, and Health. In addition, the Qingdao Observatory is affiliated with the municipal government. It is found that the municipal funding of Qingdao, in addition to the customs cooperative loan (about 600,000 yuan per year), has an annual income of about 3 million yuan from pier donations, land taxes, and miscellaneous items. Before the reorganization, the annual expenditure was about 3 million yuan, and the income and expenditure could be offset. After the reorganization into a special municipality, the scale expanded, and the expenditure increased sharply. Administrative expenses have always been insufficient, and various construction projects have been unable to proceed. Later, Wu left and Ma (Fuxiang) came, following the old system, and the funding became more and more difficult. They had to find ways to increase revenue (such as collecting banquet donations and entertainment donations) to supplement it. Now Ma has been transferred to the chairman of Anhui Province, and Ge Jing'en has succeeded as mayor. At the beginning of Ge's inauguration, he took the streamlining policy as the guiding principle for governing Qingdao. In recent days, he has made great efforts to consolidate the bureaus. It is heard that the consolidation methods of the bureaus are that the organization of the Port Affairs and Public Security Bureaus has not changed much, the Land Bureau has been merged into the Finance Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau has been merged into the Public Works Bureau, and the Education Bureau and the Health Bureau have been merged into the Social Affairs Bureau. The Public Works Bureau still has four sections: the first section is the General Affairs Section, the second section is in charge of design, the third section is in charge of public utilities, and the fourth section is in charge of road repair and construction. As for water affairs, it has been separated and renamed the Qingdao Special Municipality Waterworks. Since the Social Affairs Bureau has been merged into the Education and Health Bureaus, the affairs are more complicated than before. In addition to the original sections of the bureau, two more sections, Education and Health, have been added. It is heard that after this streamlining, tens of thousands of yuan can be saved each year, and the saved funds will be transferred to construction. It has been decided to officially implement it from April 1.</p>
<h3>Letter from Jinshan County Government</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern, on the morning of the 21st of this month, a large gang of bandits disturbed Zhujing. The police team of our county and the police of the Public Security Bureau, together with the water police, went forward and attacked fiercely. After five hours, the bandits were defeated. In this battle, the police team soldiers and the Public Security Bureau police officers did not suffer any loss. Today, I read the news column of the 22nd of your newspaper, "The gang of bandits attempted to disturb Zhujing and have been dispersed," which stated that three soldiers of the Jinshan County Public Security Team encountered dozens of defeated bandits in Huangqiao and were robbed of their firearms. This is not consistent with the facts. Please correct it as soon as possible. Jinshan County Government, Jiangsu 3.24</p>

<p>Private Jianda University is Ordered to Close. The Municipal Education Bureau specifically sent a letter to the eighteen board members of the school on the 22nd to convene a meeting at the Education Bureau on the 21st to discuss measures. A method for refunding fees was decided upon.

This bureau convened a meeting of the board members on February 22 to discuss the closure measures, and the two resolutions are copied and issued to you. The board members should immediately investigate the exact amount of fees paid by the students and the fees to be refunded and report them to the bureau so that the bank deposit can be appropriately withdrawn and distributed by the school. The students are eagerly awaiting the funds and should not be delayed. This is of utmost importance." Enclosed are two copies of the resolutions: (1) Resolution on the method of refunding student fees: (A) Mr. Huang Wenshan, Mr. Chen Tingfan, and Mr. Huang Youfeng will investigate the exact amount of fees paid by the students. (B) Withdraw a suitable amount from the deposit in the Agricultural and Industrial Bank to refund the various fees owed to the students.

<h3>Resignation of the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau from the Presidency of the Self-Government Association</h3>

I should have accepted your command, but I also hold the position of Party Education Officer and do not have time to divide my attention. Therefore, I am unable to take on the responsibilities entrusted to me. I hope for your understanding. I am sending this letter to inform you."</p>
<h3>Record of the Bureau Affairs Meeting of the County Education Bureau</h3>

Those present were Inspector Zhu, Zheng Guozhai, Sun Tingfang, Yao Juechen, Pan Xingsan, Cai Xingsan, Yao Xingshu, Wu Renda, and Ni Boying. Inspector Zhu presided over the meeting, and Ni Boying recorded the minutes. After the usual formalities, the meeting proceeded to report on matters and then discussed the following: (1) How should this year's literacy campaign be planned and implemented? It was resolved to submit the matter for discussion at the second Social Education Agency meeting. (2) Should the request of the Tenth People's School to add a grade be approved? It was resolved that since the school had more than one hundred students (an investigation showed that eighty-six students were actually present), the request to add a grade should be approved for the time being. However, if the number of students decreases, the grade should be merged immediately. (3) Should the Farmers' Education Center originally established at the Third People's School be moved to Shangbin? It was resolved that the Farmers' Education Center attached to the supplementary school, originally at the Third People's School, should be moved to Shangbin Elementary School.

<h3>Popular Lecture by the Municipal Education Bureau</h3>
<p>The Popular Lecture Group of the Municipal Education Bureau held a popular lecture at the Feihong Municipal Elementary School in Zhabei on March 22. About 600 citizens and students attended. The meeting started at 2:00 PM with the usual formalities. The head of the group, Li Dachao, reported, stating that few citizens in the city were literate, and many were illiterate. Only a handful understood current affairs and had common knowledge. The bureau was holding popular lectures as part of social education. The main purpose was to instill common knowledge and report on recent and easily understood news about the Party and the country. Lectures would be held once a week, and citizens were encouraged to participate actively. Shao Minghe and Shen Junda then gave lectures. After the lectures, the various schools began their performances. The First Elementary School performed [The March 18th Massacre], vividly depicting the tragic scene on March 18, 1926, when various Beijing organizations held a national conference at Tiananmen, went to the State Council to petition, and were surrounded and massacred by the government guards, causing many deaths and injuries. The audience was heartbroken. Jiancheng Elementary School performed two acts, one entitled [Regret It Too Late], which used a contract of sale to illustrate the harm of illiteracy, as a piece of paper was mistakenly written with the contract price, resulting in losses, inspiring people to study. The other was [The Joy of Deep Spring (Dance)], which was exquisite and lively and worth seeing. Feihong performed [Elimination], encouraging people to persevere and strive despite difficulties and obstacles, with profound implications.</p>

<h3>Dismissed with a Laugh</h3>
<p>— Seafarer</p>
<p>▲Daughter: Mother, will I have to marry a husband in the future?</p>
<p>Mother: It's up to you. But most women in the world do.</p>
<p>Daughter: Mother, then I'm ten years old this year. Should I go find a husband? Haven't I seen my aunt look for twenty years and still not find one?</p>
<p>▲Wife A: So your husband dares to deceive you?</p>
<p>Wife B: How can he not? Every day when he goes to the company, I always give him twenty cents for round-trip tram fare. Who knew he walked both ways but bought snacks with the money?</p>
<p>▲Doctor A: My consultation hours are scheduled from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day.</p>
<p>Doctor B: So, the rest of the time, are you still studying medicine?</p>
<p>Doctor A: No. Collecting the consultation fees owed by the patients.</p>
<p>▲Son: Father, what is optimism?</p>
<p>Father: A person suffering from a terminal illness still hires a quack doctor to treat him. That's called optimism.</p>
<p>▲Customer: The parrot you sold me can't talk. I talk to it, but it never says anything.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper: Sir, I forgot to tell you. It really can talk, but it's deaf and can't hear you.</p>
<h3>Strange Anecdotes of Mr. Wu Youling of Sichuan</h3>
<p>— Fu Qinxin</p>
<p>Mr. Youling, named Yu, was from Chengdu, Sichuan. Hu Shi called him the old hero who single-handedly fought against the Confucian shop. This refers to Mr. Wu. He taught at Peking University for a very long time and was renowned throughout the country. I was fortunate enough to be under his wing for half a year in the Jiazi year (1924), and I know his affairs in great detail. I respectfully select those obscure and not yet widely known, and record them, to inform the scholars.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu lost his wife early. He had several daughters, all with extensive literary knowledge and beautiful appearance. The youngest daughter married a gentleman from Henan two years ago and is currently studying abroad with him. The second daughter fell in love with a Mr. Pan Lishan in Washington, D.C. Mr. Wu was deeply displeased that she married without informing him and ceased all communication. Mr. Wu's Beijing residence was at No. 5 Liangguo Factory. It was a secluded and comfortable place. He converted the large hall into a library, and the remaining two rooms were used as a bedroom and reception area. Only one servant was employed to provide meals and cleaning. Upon entering his hall, books and literary works lined the shelves, a dazzling array, like entering a valley of ten thousand flowers. He was often seen alone, profound and refined, as if he had found his own joy. He was truly like a person from Peach Blossom Spring.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's scholarship was most beloved by the Japanese. His "Wenyu Wenlu" was practically a copy in every hand. They also extracted his speeches and reprinted them in various newspapers and magazines, such as "Sinology" and "Figures of the Dawn of China," which were the most notable. Modern Japanese writers and Sinologists with deep understanding and sympathy for Mr. Wu sent letters from overseas, expressing their warm regards. My friend Chu Yian, who was most esteemed by Mr. Wu, visited him every evening. He saw them all and spoke of them in great detail.</p>
<p>Yang Shukan of Sichuan, a prominent figure in the revolution, once served as Minister of Agriculture and Commerce during Duan Qirui's administration. Mr. Wu despised him. One day, they happened to meet at a friend's place. Mr. Wu remained aloof and did not offer a greeting. Afterwards, he said to others, "Mr. Yang is tempted by power and profit and has lost his footing. Not only is his personal integrity flawed, but his political life will also be ruined."</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Yinggong's spirit. Cheng Yuyi wept bitterly for him, even suspending performances to mourn. Mr. Wu praised him and wrote a poem to commemorate the event. I remember one of his poems: "[The orioles, parrots, silkworms, and fleas have long been a cause for sorrow. I once read of your difficulties and felt saddened by the loss of virtue. Today, I meet a national beauty in Yantai, her beauty captivating and her heart chivalrous.]" Even in occasional amusement, it was elegant and extraordinary, unlike anything ordinary.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu was extremely unrestrained and enjoyed frequenting brothels. His presence was often seen in the "eight districts." Every evening when the lanterns were lit and the bells jingled, there was an old man stroking his beard and smiling, reclining among the flowers, which was Mr. Wu at his happiest. His poems recording these events were fragrant and exquisite. They were once printed in a beautifully bound edition and given to friends. Even the line "[Suddenly touching my private parts, it rises like a tomb]" was included in the miscellany, which shows that he was not one to be拘泥于小节. Mr. Wu hated evil as if it were an enemy and was tired of hearing about the changes in the world. In recent years, the war has become increasingly urgent, and he knew that peace was hopeless. He decided to abandon Beijing and return to his hometown in the summer of Yichou (1925), where he secluded himself, wrote books, and enjoyed his old age. From then on, the spiritual light of Lu Dian stood alone in Chengdu.</p>
<h3>Unbelievable Common Sense</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhou</p>
<p>▲ Fish Bone Stuck in Throat: Whenever a fish bone is stuck in the throat, do not open your mouth. Take the eating utensils you are holding, such as a rice bowl or wine cup, and rotate it once to the right. Then, take a mouthful of rice or a little wine and swallow it directly into the throat. The bone will immediately be dislodged. This method was learned from the Zhuyou (incantation) department and has been tested and proven effective many times. However, the reason for it is inexplicable.</p>
<p>▲ Lumps on Limbs: Lumps often appear between the joints of the limbs due to careless movement. They swell larger and larger. Although not very harmful, they are unsightly. I once strained myself lifting heavy objects, and a lump rose on the back of my hand and wrist. Both Western and Chinese medicine were tried. Some said to apply a plaster, others said to cut it open, but none of it worked. Later, in Suzhou, I met a fellow townsman, Mr. Xu Guiqing, who said that rubbing it during a thunderstorm can gradually reduce it until it disappears. I tried it last summer, and it worked. Unexpectedly, it has recently reappeared, but it is very small. I plan to try it again during a thunderstorm. If anyone has the same problem, please try it for me to confirm its effectiveness.</p>
<p>The above two items cannot be explained scientifically, but based on my personal experience, they are unfailingly effective. Readers, please do not despise and discard them as unfounded.</p>
<h3>New Voices for Calendar Reform</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>The calendar used by societies in various countries is very old. But since the European War, there have been proposals to revise it. There are several reasons, mainly that the current calendar is difficult to remember and difficult to examine. For example, the date of Easter changes every year, and the day of the week of Christmas also changes, causing great inconvenience. Recently, the Americans have revived the issue, and the voices for calendar reform are soaring. The local English evening newspaper has reported this news, but it is brief and lacks detail. According to the new calendar proposed by the Americans, each year would have 365 days, with one day removed as a public holiday at the beginning of the year, not included in the week. The remaining days would be divided equally into four seasons, each with ninety-one days. Each season would have three months, two small and one large. The small ones have thirty days, and the large ones have thirty-one days. In this way, every four years there would be a leap year, adding one day at the end of June. This so-called leap day would be a public holiday, not counted in the week, the same as the beginning of the year. In this way, leap years would not matter, and the calendar would be fixed every year. Even without using a calendar, with a little thought, one could deduce which day of the week it is. It is indeed very convenient. Recently, major cities in the United States have organized calendar reform research committees. The committee members and experts who have joined are mostly bankers, industrialists, astronomers, sociologists, and representatives of groups and governments. The European countries are also following suit. For example, the Dutch Calendar Reform Committee has recently been established, and Professor Nijland of the University of the Netherlands is personally chairing it. Mr. Nijland is a well-known astronomer and has published books on calendar reform discussions, attracting a lot of sympathy from the public. According to Western newspapers, since the Americans advocated calendar reform, countries all over the world have successively expressed their support and intend to take the same steps. As of now, there are more than ten countries, including Panama, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, the Netherlands, France, Hungary, Cuba, and other small countries.</p>
<h3>Overseas Tealeaves</h3>
<p>— Tian Peng, sent from Tokyo</p>
<p>The vicissitudes of Wilhelm II: Wilhelm has been living a secluded and boring life since his exile in the Netherlands. Recently, he celebrated his seventy-first birthday. None of his children and grandchildren, who used to surround him, came to visit. It is said that they lacked travel expenses and could not make the trip. Wilhelm recalled the grand gatherings of the past and could not help but feel emotional.</p>
<p>▲ A fifteen-foot-tall stone head: The famous Italian sculptor Lamina is currently working on a stone statue of General Garibaldi, using the world's largest marble. It is said to be fifteen feet tall, and the artist standing on the shoulders only reaches his nose. It will be erected as a national landmark.</p>
<p>▲ A school of fish flying from the sky: A man named Karis in Rhodesia, England, suddenly saw a school of fish flying from the sky. The grounds and flower beds were covered with fish. He was shocked and nearly went mad. The citizens were also alarmed by this strange event. After careful study by interested people, it was found that the fish from a nearby pond had been swept up by a hurricane.</p>
<p>▲ A female poisoning gang in Hungary: A small village in Hungary called Zorno recently captured a female poisoning gang of thirty people. The investigation revealed that the women in the entire village were involved. The victims were husbands, lovers, youths, children, etc. Anyone who was disliked was poisoned to death.</p>
<p>▲ A car catches fire and goes to the fire department for help: In England, a steam-powered car caught fire due to negligence. The conductor panicked and did not know what to do. The police told him to quickly go to the fire department to extinguish it, and it was saved. This is a new world record for seeking help when a fire breaks out.</p>
<p>▲ The first trial in the Vatican: Recently, the Vatican City exercised its judicial power, which is the first case of the restoration of the Papal Court. It is a very interesting issue. There were many people in the audience. The offender was a thief. Because the laws of the Holy See have not yet been established, Italian law was temporarily cited to sentence him to three months in prison.</p>

<h3>The Theatrical Skills of Kunqu Actress Jing Yanfang</h3>
<p>— Shu Lin</p>
<p>Kunqu actress Jing Yanfang is the beloved daughter of Jing Yufeng. She is twenty-seven years old and has a slender figure. She has been learning Qingyi and Huashan plays from her mother for many years. She is intelligent and diligent and has mastered more than thirty plays. She is currently performing at the Great World (amusement park) with the Da Jing class (opera troupe). I do not usually praise Kunqu actresses. Yesterday, at the insistence of a friend, I happened to pass by and saw Yanfang performing "Scolding the Palace." I could not help but stop and listen. The Yaoban (clapper aria) in the first scene and the Daoban (reversed aria), Huilong tune, and slow Sanzheizi (three-beat rhythm) in the second scene were all smooth and natural. The Kuai Sanzheizi in the latter two halls were also fluent and pleasant to hear. Although this play does not have much physical acting, listening to these few sections of singing is like tasting a small piece of the whole tripod, which is enough to know its general features. According to my friend, her other plays, such as the flexibility of her drunken waist work, the charm of her performance, and the heavy singing in "Yu Tang Chun," all show her strengths. There are also plays such as "Magu's Birthday Celebration," "Mantou Temple," "Flying to the Moon," and "Scattering Flowers." Every time she appears on stage, the embroidered curtain is lifted, and the applause is like thunder. It can be seen that Yanfang's theatrical skills certainly have the ability to attract audiences.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (155)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Flaming Inferno, Grandstand Admiring a Filial Daughter, Red Carpet Laid Out, Improvised Meeting with Famous Actors. That Zhang's Weichun Garden is also someone's garden. That garden owner, Mr. Zhang, is from Changzhou. He served several terms as Daotai in the Qing Dynasty. The most mysterious kind of bureaucrat was called Daotai. The most omnipotent kind of official was also Daotai. In the past, in Nanjing alone, there were several hundred candidates for Daotai. Therefore, some people also said that Nanjing had three many: many kidnappers, many donkeys, many candidates for Daotai. Being a Daotai could be good or bad. Those who got rich and important positions were Red Daotai. Even the Fan-Tai (provincial treasurer) and Nie-Tai (provincial judge) could not compare with him. They could plunder hundreds of thousands of silver in a year and leave. The black ones were completely blackened. They could be candidates for more than ten years and not get any assignments, ending up eating their fill and running out of money, not even having enough robes to go to the yamen. There were also some like that. Moreover, Daotais had all kinds of abilities and could be any kind of official. Civilian ones could be school Daotai or grain Daotai. Military ones could be military preparation Daotai. Speaking of foreign affairs assignments, they were also Daotai. That garden owner, Mr. Zhang, was also a Daotai. With the gains from his official career, he came to Shanghai and built this garden. Some people said that he was impeached by his superiors and returned home as a corrupt official. That is not our concern. In short, he was willing to make this private garden public. Coming to his garden did not require buying a ticket. Anyone could run in. This had a bit of an egalitarian flavor. He had a large foreign-style building. Rather than saying it was a garden, it was more like a hall for gatherings. Sitting in that foreign-style building required ordering a bowl of tea. The waiter would immediately bring up several dishes: melon seeds, peanuts, and candy. You could eat as much as you wanted. Each bowl of tea cost two jiao, and each dish cost only five fen. Considering the cost of living at that time, it was not expensive at all. At that time, some people who were someone's friends would rather stroll around the periphery of the foreign-style building than dare to go inside. When the garden owner encountered festivals or the New Year holidays or the race season, he would supervise the tea servers and waiters in the foreign-style building, checking how many tables were serving tea and how much tea they could sell. When there were many visitors, they could sell hundreds of bowls of tea a day. This could be considered a source of income for the garden owner. Moreover, he was always smiling. He seemed to recognize everyone, as if he were a receptionist there. When he met acquaintances, he would sit at this table and then at that table, chatting all the way. Especially the courtesans in the hall, especially the older ones, he would recognize even more. He would definitely come over and exchange a few words with them. They would naturally call him "Master Zhang" and chat with him. In addition, he would lend this foreign-style building to people for meetings. Any large meeting would be held at Zhang Garden. Any exciting ____ would be held at Zhang Garden. Because, in Shanghai, apart from this Zhang Garden, there was no place that was so versatile and suitable for combining styles.</p>

<h3>Financial Standard Gold Falls for Several Days</h3>
<h3>Yesterday, an Abnormal Rebound Was Discovered</h3>
<p>▲ From a Decaying Trend into a Firm State: Yesterday (the 24th), the situation of the standard gold at the beginning of the week showed another peak, but it changed from weak to firm, with fluctuations of four taels and several qian each time. Even the foreign exchange also became strong. The banks' buying appetite was not weak. The mentality of the same industry was soft at first, then healthy later. The Qian Shi Shunli, Wanxing, Fuchang, etc., were all competing to buy, while Zhifeng, Yongsheng, Dayuan Cheng Yong, etc., had already sold out. Although the big orders contracted the day before yesterday, the silver price rose instead, so the opening was low. However, due to the eagerness of the buyers and the good foreign exchange, it immediately rose by three or four taels. At noon, the sellers became active again, and it has fallen by more than one tael. Later, Wanxing and Shunli resold in the afternoon, and Yu Da Hengxing bought. The exchange rate was particularly tight, and suddenly it peaked, exceeding ninety-six taels. Afterwards, there was a slight fluctuation of one tael. Finally, it seemed to be trending upwards, at around ninety-six taels. The forward English gold could be sold at 11 pence 625, and the Japanese gold at 1 tael 0.35. The previous day, the London silver bars all contracted by one-sixteenth, and the silver price rose by eight and two-thirds of a cent.</p>

Afterwards, it suddenly fell to ninety-one taels and seven qian, and there were many sellers. Soon after, the gross price returned to two taels. This was probably because the six-month English gold in the Wheat Exchange advanced to 11 pence 6875 first, then the Huabi bought at 625, and the HSBC also advanced at the same price, so the opening price was raised to ninety-four taels. The listed prices, except for the Japanese gold, which added 125, remained unchanged. Internally, it seemed firm. Mitsui absorbed the forward Japanese gold at 1 tael 0.30625 to 125, and Sumitomo bought the five-month English gold at 11 pence 5625. In addition, Xiangyu and Fuchang in the market rushed to catch up, and it continued to jump by more than one tael, reaching 95 taels and six qian at 10:30. After a while, Hengxing and others came out again, so the English gold was slightly looser, and Sumitomo and Zhongxing did the next month at 11 pence and a half. The McAlister bought 625 for June, and the recent Japanese gold could be settled at 1 tael and 4 fen. So it fell back by more than one tael. At 11 o'clock, it was ninety-four taels and two qian, plus six or seven qian. Afterwards, the sellers did not slacken, and after 11:30, it was only ninety-three taels and nine qian, and in a flash, it was four taels and a half. At noon, it still closed at ninety-four taels.</p>
<p>▲ Closing Price Rises by Two Taels and Six Qian: The opening price for the afternoon was ninety-four taels and a half, which was due to the increase in the price of goods. Later, the buying interest of Hengxing and others was strong, and the foreign exchange was also firm. North Korea's Sumitomo sold the six-month Japanese gold at 1 tael 0.35, and Anda Zhengjin sold the forward English gold to Holland at 11 pence 625, so it increased by one tael and six or seven qian. After 2:30, it was ninety-six taels and one or two qian. After this, retail investors sold, so it depreciated by one tael. After 3 o'clock, it was four taels and nine qian. Afterwards, the buyers were very strong, and the Japanese gold was quite active. The industry wanted to buy, and the banks sold it. After 4 o'clock, the banks absorbed the seven-month English gold at 11 pence 625, so the gold price rose to ninety-six taels. At 4:30, the closing price was ninety-five taels and nine qian, which was one tael and five qian higher than last Saturday. This was a rebound after many days of consecutive declines.</p>
<p>▲ Dalian Gang Buys in the Morning, Sells in the Afternoon: The buying and selling of each company was very active.

The goods opened at ninety-two taels and eight qian in the morning, closed at four taels and two qian at noon, and four taels and seven qian in the afternoon, with a closing price of six taels and one qian.</p>

<h3>Yarn Prices Recently Fell Nearly Fifty Taels</h3>
<p>▲ Thick Accumulation of Inventory...Sluggish Actual Demand</p>
<p>▲ Chaotic Situation...Strong Selling Pressure</p>
<p>The yarn market trend is quite weak, due to the increasing inventory and the stagnation in sales of 10-count coarse yarn and a batch of unsold goods on the market. Therefore, although buyers are trying their best, they ultimately cannot support it. In addition, the chaotic situation shows signs of prolonging. As a result, sellers are becoming more courageous and exerting more pressure. Therefore, the yarn price, which has been brewing for a long time this month, is now approaching the end of the month. Buyers see the overall situation as unfavorable and have no intention of taking delivery, resulting in a very poor situation. The 50 tael threshold is difficult to maintain, and most targets must be 46-47 taels, but some are not giving up on the idea of going long because of the cheap base.</p>
<p>▲ This Month's Yarn Sellers Prepared to Deliver, Suffered a Sharp Drop of Two Jiao Six Fen, First Bid Auction, Market Opening. This month, sellers are preparing to deliver goods, but sales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd and coarse yarn are lacking, so the market trend is quite loose, and inventory in warehouses is increasing daily. The decline this month is particularly severe, falling one tael and three qian, with distant declines of four, six, and eight qian. In the afternoon, the market sentiment for this month was quite soft, but later, profiteers bought back, causing a rebound. In the end, this month fell three qian, and the distant month rose one or two qian. The total transaction statistics for the day were 21,100 bales. The auction closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Auction, Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Inventory, Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Inventory</p>
<p>March 150.70 Down 1.62 0,850 June 151.80 Down 3.24 0,050</p>
<p>April 151.50 6.40 0,200 July 152.40 2.22 0,050</p>
<p>May 151.50 7.31 702 August 152.90 4.18 500</p>
<p>▲ Demand for Spot Yarn Shows Further Weakness, Spot Yarn Sales Remain Flat. According to statistics, all buyers bought 1,190 bales throughout the day. Antung merchants purchased 300 bales of futures, and fellow merchants purchased 625 bales. The market is weak. Among customer merchants, Tianjin has the strongest demand, accounting for 260 bales. In addition, Qingdao 125 bales, Wuhu 50 bales, Guangdong 75 bales, Inland 180 bales, Nanyang 100 bales, Shantou 55 bales, Sichuan 125 bales, Xuzhou 55 bales, Jinan 80 bales, Miscellaneous 80 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Suddenly Turns Soft</h3>
<p>Indian cotton prices are rising sharply, while American cotton prices show mixed gains and losses. The local cotton market mostly expects prices to soften. Moreover, demand for spot cotton from various factories is quiet, and deliveries this month have increased. The market sentiment is loose, and some profiteers are closing out, causing the market to fall. The cotton market situation is still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>▲ Han Standard Near and Distant Months Each Down Two and a Half Qian. The futures cotton market opened in the morning. Although foreign cotton prices rose, the selling pressure in the market was stronger. Deliveries this month were higher, and the market turned down. As this month softened, distant months were affected, and all months fell by one qian five fen to three qian. The market was flat and weak in the afternoon. In the end, each month rose or fell by five fen to one qian. The total transaction statistics for the day were 43,800 dan. The Han Standard closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>Indian and British Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>▲ Bombay, Last week's market prices rose with American cotton. Local sentiment leaned towards long positions, but overall it was difficult to maintain, because once the price ratio approached, foreign demand decreased. Although the number of new transactions by exporters is currently not firm, due to the imminent passage of the Cotton Industry Protection Order, exporters are actively compensating, local manufacturers are freely purchasing, and spot demand is very strong. The statistical appendix for last week is as follows (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>Previous Week, Last Week</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts since September 1, 2,391 2,474</p>
<p>Weekend inventory 1,332 1,298</p>
<p>Cumulative exports since September 1, 1,377 1,414</p>
<p>Exports to Europe 468 470</p>
<p>Exports to China 175 201</p>
<p>Exports to Japan 679 706</p>
<p>Other regions 37 37</p>
<p>▲ Liverpool, Last week's spot sales were very good. Futures sentiment favored long positions due to lower bank interest rates and rising silver prices. Moreover, the International Cotton Federation's semi-annual report, its global consumption, and the generally stated poor business were contradictory, so the buying trend was even stronger. Egyptian cotton fluctuated due to price restrictions.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Sales Brisk and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>▲ Top White Japonica Reaches 20 Yuan and 5 Jiao...Food for the People Deserves Attention ▲ Zhabei, Yesterday the market rose again, with very few ships coming from the interior. The market in this street is brisk. Top-quality Northern Japonica rice is very scarce, so the price reached 20 yuan and 5 jiao. Ordinary Middle Grade rice generally increased by several jiao. Currently, river inventory is gradually thinning. The prices in the producing and selling areas are not economical. At this time of year, when the new harvest is not yet available, the food supply in Shanghai in the future is a matter of great concern. Local sales are mainly Japonica rice, so new high prices are appearing. Thin Indica rice has attracted interest from customer merchants, and the trend is active. Both buyers and sellers are shouting for tightness. Sheep Du Xian rice has risen by one or two jiao due to the sharp rise in foreign rice. Customer ports also have strong demand for Indica rice, but retail sales are not smooth, and prices are following the general trend. Buying interest in White Yuan rice is still flat, and various firms are not eager to purchase, so there is no significant increase or decrease.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai South, Ships arriving from the river are not strong, and sales were very sluggish in the early morning, but then improved due to tight news from Zhabei. Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other Japonica rice prices were initially flat but then became firm, with about one jiao difference. Villagers and customers are waiting and watching due to the current high prices, but sellers, on the other hand, are raising prices due to the strong market in the interior. There are also rumors that a certain customer merchant is purchasing and hoarding goods extensively in the interior. Although this is just hearsay, it is not without reason, so the goals of buyers and sellers are even more firm. Sales of Southern Shanghai's thin early rice are relatively weak, and incoming goods are not abundant, but the market price is not easy to rise again. Sheep Du Xian rice is actually very scarce here. Although a few shipments have arrived, foreign rice prices are not rising, and therefore the price of this rice is also increasing. The sales are also brisk. The changes are similar to those in the North Market, and the price of hanging embryos is slightly moving, and the market is neither good nor bad.</p>
<h3>Fluctuations in Futures Foreign Rice Are Uncertain</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot price of foreign rice turned flat, because although various merchants had strong intentions to purchase, there were reports of large new arrivals, and most were waiting and watching. The overall market only saw domestic merchants purchasing small amounts of Xiaojiao rice, 2,000 bags, priced at 14 yuan and 6 jiao to 14 yuan 5 jiao 2 fen; two bags of Saigon No. 2, 500 bags, priced at 15 yuan 1 jiao 7 fen. After the opening of the futures foreign rice market in the morning, Nissin sold 700 tons of April Xiaojiao, priced at 6 taels and a half, and Minden sold 1,000 bags, priced at 6 taels and 8 qian. Nissin's sale made everyone expect prices to fall, because the recent rise was due to foreign firms holding the line. Now that foreign firms were selling, a small rebound in the price was seen, but except for Nissin, no one else was selling. Western merchants were still willing to buy back, so the price suddenly rebounded by six or seven fen in the evening. The market fluctuated suddenly, forming a swirling pattern. The total market traded 2,500 tons of futures rice, with Xiaojiao accounting for the majority.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Initially Flat, Then High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, when the flour market opened in the morning, the prices of foreign wheat were reported, with Chicago having fallen by five or six jiao, and Canada having fallen by one yuan and two or three jiao. Therefore, the opening prices for each month were generally flat. For example, April was even lower than the previous week by seven and a half li. However, in subsequent sessions, sentiment had already turned, and prices were raised very sharply. It was heard that the Yingkou merchants were buying heavily in the market this month, and their quantity was estimated to reach 230,000, and the factories, because the sampling has exceeded the amount released, in a single shift, as if it has become a long position, and speculators are in an environment that has changed, and there are many people engaged in looting, so the market is profitable step by step, and when the afternoon market opened, all parties expected the customer's taste to be very good, and the factory had the phenomenon of empty squeeze, and the people were very excited, and the highest price of this month was 2 taels, 5 qian and 6 fen, and April to 2 taels, 5 qian and 5 and a half fen, higher than the previous week, counted 2 to 3 fen or so, and then, with the floating and returning, a little bit lower, and the forward months, because the domestic merchants, with the high price of rice, and also to buy the force, so also brought a lot of high, but heard that Tianjin's help also directly fixed the 3rd foreign flour yellow bull brand 20,000 bags, the price of the total application 2 taels, 1 qian and 5 fen, Sanjing brand 60,000 bags, the price of 2 taels, 1 qian and 2 fen, so if the market is more advanced, the Tianjin sales market, will not be able to pick up, and the result is 2 fen higher than the previous week, April is 1 and a half points higher, May is 7 and a half points, June is 1 point, July is 7 and a half points, August is 5 points.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Near Wilted, Far Excellent</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market, when the market opened in the morning, the market in each month, presented a phenomenon of near falling and far flat, with Jiangbei having already been opened, and in addition to this month, because of the squeezing of both long and short sides, there is a phenomenon of either death or life, and the short side is now generally preparing for the spot, so the opening price can see a hard suppression, and the lowest time has fallen to 5 taels, 1 qian and 6 fen, a huge fall of 7 points compared to the previous week, and April also fell 3 points, and the far period is in excellent trend, and are higher than, and when the market opened in the afternoon, this month, because the handover is in the future, the bulls are not willing to let go, (heard that the delivery amount is about 60) the flour market is also good, and it is also rebounding quite strongly, and the distant months, because the domestic merchants are buying in, never slackening, and the result is 2 points less than the previous week, April is 1 point, June and July are 2 points better, August is 1 point better, and the spot wheat market, with the factory taste very good, the market is standing, the opening of the Southern Suzhou wheat 5 taels, 1 qian, Qingjiangpu wheat 5 taels, 1 qian, Bengbu wheat 5 taels, 1 qian, Anqing wheat 5 taels, 0, 7 and 8 points, 5 taels, 0 and 5 points, Jiangxi wheat 4 taels, 6 qian and 8 points, 4 taels and 7 qian, 4 taels and 8 qian, 4 taels and 9 qian and 6 points, 4 taels and 9 qian and 3 points, Hunan wheat 4 taels and 6 qian and 3 points, a total of 3,000 packages were opened.</p>

<p>▲ Local Cotton Cloth, Yesterday's Trend Turned Upward, Especially Fine Twill. In fact, Guangdong, Xiamen, Ningbo, and other merchants all rushed to buy yesterday, and the search on this street was also very active, so that the spot goods were almost exhausted, and the opening prices were all soaring.

<h3>Owner of American Sun Newspaper Flew to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Departed from London on February 11</p>
<p>▲ Flew Across the Three Continents of Europe, Africa, and Asia to Arrive</p>
<p>▲ Currently Deciding to Continue Flying to Korea and Japan</p>
<p>Mr. White Locke, the owner of the American Baltimore Sun, prepared a large monoplane and departed from London on February 11, flying across the three continents of Europe, Africa, and Asia. Yesterday morning at 7 o'clock, he continued flying to Shanghai from Hong Kong, and flew to Hongqiao Airport at 3:45 in the afternoon, landing safely. White Locke is currently staying at the Dahua Hotel. It is reported that he has decided to continue flying to Seoul in Korea and Tokyo in Japan, but the date of departure from Shanghai has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>▲ Safely Arrived in Shanghai. Local Chinese and foreign dignitaries concerned received the confirmation that White Locke continued to fly to Shanghai from Hong Kong, and dozens of people went to Hongqiao Airport yesterday afternoon to welcome him. They waited until 3:30, and heard the rumbling of the airplane engine in the air, and looked up to see a silver airplane flying from the east. Bai Locke and his airplane, photographed by Huifang Photography Studio at the Racecourse</p>
<p>The people standing at the airport to welcome him immediately waved their handkerchiefs to signal, and the airplane circled the field twice and landed leisurely. It was 3:45. The welcomers surrounded the fuselage, and White Locke, his secretary, and the pilot came out and shook hands and talked with the welcomers. Then they drove to the Dahua Hotel to stay.</p>
<p>▲ A Glimpse of the Fuselage. The airplane that White Locke was riding in was named [Maryland Liberty State] and was a huge monoplane. The fuselage was three colors, the head was silver-white, the middle section was black, and the tail was cyan-blue. The wings were golden yellow. The interior of the airplane had five seats and was quite comfortable. It was equipped with three engines, which were started at the same time when flying. The fuselage weighed 700 pounds, carried 500 pounds, and had 300 horsepower. It could fly continuously in the air for 12 hours. The average speed was 120 miles per hour. It was made in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>▲ White Locke's Remarks. White Locke, the owner of the Sun Newspaper, has been engaged in the news business for 14 years. The Baltimore Sun, which he runs, is divided into morning and evening editions. White Locke told this newspaper's reporter at the Dahua Hotel yesterday, "I (White Locke referred to himself below) took off from London on February 11 and first landed in Marseille, France. Then I continued to fly through 13 cities including Cairo, Beckett, Bangok, and Hanoi, and arrived in Hong Kong last Wednesday. After arriving in Shanghai today, there is no definite date for departure. I will not fly to Nanjing and Beiping, but China Airlines has invited me to take the company's Shanghai-Hankou airplane for a trip to Beijing and Hankou, but it has not yet been determined. After that, I decided to fly to Seoul in Korea and then to Tokyo in Japan, and then take a boat back to the United States. My flight has been very smooth along the way. It was quite interesting to see the Siamese people performing Chinese martial arts in Bangok. The purpose of my trip is purely commercial and experimental, and to use the speed of flight to travel the world, and to prove that airplanes have a close relationship with the news business. When we flew to a part of Africa, there were more than a dozen British people who had no newspapers to read and had not received letters for several weeks. When we flew to that place and showed them the newspapers we were carrying, the British people there competed to read them. A newspaper was as precious as a treasure and worth a lot of money. From Hong Kong to Shanghai, it only takes one day, which is very convenient for the transmission of newspapers and communications."</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Reports on Recent Diplomatic Matters</h3>
<p>▲ Russia Requests Expansion of Conference Scope</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Ministry Has Telegraphed Liaoning to Inquire About Everything</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting reported to newspaper reporters yesterday on recent diplomatic news. They are described separately below:</p>
<p>▲ Recovery of French Concession Police Station. Foreign Minister Wang said that regarding the recovery of the French Concession Police Station in Shanghai, the Foreign Ministry sent a note to the French Minister, requesting that he send personnel to Beijing as soon as possible to discuss reorganization methods. However, since the note was issued, the French side has not made any response. It is thought that because the French cabinet has changed repeatedly, the China issue has been put on hold. As for the outside rumors that the Foreign Ministry will directly send the note to Paris because the French Minister is about to return home, this is the statement of someone who does not understand diplomatic procedures, because even if the French Minister leaves, there must be a chargé d'affaires to exercise the powers of the Minister, and there is no reason to send it directly to Paris.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Provisional Court. The reorganization of the Provisional Court of the Public Concession is scheduled to be implemented on April 1 and will not be postponed. The reorganization plan is entirely based on the agreement signed in Beijing by the representatives of various countries. Xu Mo, Director of the European and American Department, came to Shanghai a few days ago to make further contacts with the representatives of various countries, and the result was very satisfactory, and the reorganization can be carried out smoothly.</p>
<p>▲ Weihaiwei Issue. Regarding the recovery of the Weihaiwei issue, an agreement has been largely reached. When British Minister Lampson arrives in Beijing at the end of this month, it can be formally signed after a brief discussion.</p>
<p>▲ Sino-Russian Conference Period. The official Sino-Russian conference is scheduled to be held in mid-next month. Our representative, Mo Dehui, is scheduled to depart for Moscow on April 10. The news reported by Japan stated that Russia refused to open peace talks and refused our representative, and also said that Russia requested to expand the scope of the conference, otherwise it would send troops to disturb the border. The Foreign Ministry has not received an official report and has telegraphed Liaoning to inquire about everything, but there is no reply yet.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Negotiations Underway</h3>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Met With Shigemitsu Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Exchanged Views on Legal Rights Issues</p>
<p>▲ Shigemitsu Will Go to Beijing to Continue Negotiations</p>
<p>Regarding the legal jurisdiction issue in the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce, Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu Kui has repeatedly made informal contacts with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting. Yesterday afternoon at approximately 3 o'clock, Wang Zhengting met with Shigemitsu at the Diplomatic Discussion Association on Avenue Joffre and talked for about an hour before Shigemitsu took his leave. The content was still discussing the legal rights issue, and the opinions of both sides are becoming closer. The date of resolution should not be far away. Foreign Minister Wang told this newspaper's reporter yesterday that the most important parts of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce are tariff jurisdiction and inland navigation rights. Since the tariff issue has been resolved, we are now negotiating the legal jurisdiction issue. Today's meeting was to exchange informal views on this issue. When opinions gradually become consistent, a formal meeting will be held to sign a draft. I will return to Beijing tonight (that is, last night), and Shigemitsu will go to Beijing tomorrow night (that is, tonight) to continue negotiations. There are rumors that the Japanese government will appoint Hirota as the ambassador to China to be responsible for Sino-Japanese negotiations, but Shigemitsu never mentioned it, and the Foreign Ministry has not received any reports, so I am afraid it is not true.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Mediation Decision on Pharmaceutical Industry Dispute</h3>
<p>▲ 128 Workers to Resume Work Today</p>
<p>▲ 51 Unqualified Workers to be Laid Off</p>
<p>The labor-management dispute in the city's pharmaceutical industry over the hiring of unemployed workers had reached extreme positions on both sides, leading to work slowdowns and market shutdowns. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, along with the Municipal Party Headquarters and Public Security Bureau, appointed representatives to form a mediation committee, repeatedly convening both parties for mediation. Yesterday, the Pharmaceutical Association once again petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs to conduct mediation and make a swift decision, stating that it was no longer appropriate to prolong the situation, as it was affecting patients. Yesterday, the mediation committee made a fair decision, ordering the industry's labor and management groups to comply and not to engage in further work slowdowns or market shutdowns. The decision of the case mediation is found below, in its original text:</p>
<p>▲ Decision of the Shanghai Special Municipality Labor-Management Dispute Mediation Committee (Mediation No. 400) Disputing Parties: Labor: Pharmaceutical Workers Union; Management: Preparatory Committee of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association (formerly the Pharmaceutical Division of the Business and People's Association). The above-mentioned disputing parties, due to the labor side's demand for the management side to hire unemployed workers, resulting in a strike dispute, which was mediated by the committee. With the consent and signatures of the majority of the committee members, a decision is hereby made as follows: [Main Text] (1) All original employees of pharmaceutical stores must resume work uniformly at 9:00 AM on March 25th, with wages paid as usual for the strike period. (2) Unemployed members of the Pharmaceutical Workers Union who have been examined and qualified by the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs shall be hired separately by 53 companies, including Hu Qing Yu Tang, with the allocated number of people as follows: (Hu Qing Yu Tang) Zhu Jincai (counter), Liu Songyun (pill), Wang Yongsheng (knife), Yan Xinquan (counter), Gu Meixuan (counter), Fang Pinsheng (knife), Du Jiabin (knife), Shen Jinsheng (counter), Wu Liangquan (counter), Chen Yunbin (counter), Lin Mingfu (counter), Zheng Hengshan (counter), Xu Shunxing (knife), Yan Jinru (counter), Zhou Heming (counter), (Tong Han Chun), Fang Qingjian (counter), Zhou Zuocai (counter), Zhu Rongkui (counter), Ye Yongnian (counter), Cai Yuanxing (knife), Hu Hongting (knife), Cai Shishan (counter), Bao Dajing (counter), Zhao Yueqiao (knife), Zhao Zhenhui (counter), Yang Xihui (counter), Qian Xuanmin (knife), Zhou Yaseng (counter), Zhao Xian'an (knife), Chen Weiming (knife), Cai Tongde), Chen Kunming (counter), Tao Yifeng (counter), Shen Heming (counter), Pan Zuyao (counter), Qi Ziyun (knife), Gao Kejing (knife), Yu Tianzhu (knife), Du Shiming (knife), Xiong Jinhou (counter), Nie Jintang (counter), (Feng Cunren), Huang Liqian (knife), Wei Wenbing (pill), Hu Lianfang (materials), (Wang Daji), Feng Mingliang (counter), Xu Zhongyu (counter), Peng Zixin (counter), Liu Wenyu (counter), (Xi Liangji) Li Haisheng (knife), Zhong Debao (counter), Wang Tianxiu (counter), (Ye Tiande) Chen Quansheng (knife), Wang Zugen (counter), Xie Qilin (counter), Ruan Changhua (counter), Shi Shanxiao (pill), (Bei Yanze), Wang Xiangjun (counter), Zhang Huaqing (counter), (Shu Tongshou South Branch), Wu Youyong (knife), Yu Bangting (counter), (Ren Yihe) Ding Songju (knife), Huang Yongsui (knife), (Xu Chongdao) Main Branch, Fei Fugeng (fighting), Yu Xiaxian (counter), He Zhijian (pill), Wang Yongcai (fighting knife), (Wei Detang), Lv Jusheng (knife), (Xu Shenxiu), Feng Yifu (counter) (Xu Shensan), Feng Yongyuan (counter), (Yu Liangxin), Yang Guobin (counter), Sha Zucheng (knife), Gao Bingsheng (pill), Zhou Zhirong (pill counter) (Yao Taishan) (Great East Gate), Yu Yonghua (counter), Tan Jinfa (knife), (Tong Desheng), Zhu Changhe (pill counter), Li Meihua (knife), Wei Xiqi (counter), (Jiang Yanze) Rui Ji, Xu Dingtai (knife), Qiu Qizhang (pill) (Peng Shouting) Zhu Dongchen (counter), Zhang Wen (counter), Shan Wenzhi (counter) (Su Cunde), Mi Weixian (counter), Yang Liansheng (knife), Shen Renyuan (counter), (Bao He Tang) (New North Gate) Sun Yunxia (counter), Xin Keming (knife) (Shou Quan Zhai), Wang Yuqing (counter) (Qing Yu Tang) (South City), Lin Enqing (knife), Yao Zhixin (counter), (Tian Bao Tang), Feng Shilin (counter) (Wan Shou Tang), Ding Zitang (counter), Zheng Shunlai (counter), (Zi De Tang) (Zhabei) Zheng Xizhou (counter), Zhu Bingjiang (knife) (Tong Ren Tang), Shen Liuyi (knife) (Wang Tianfu), Cheng Shaoqing (counter) (Niu Tianyi), Xia Qinsun (counter), (Ren Ren Tang) (Total of three stores), Dong Rusheng (counter), Zhang Jinbao (knife), Bian Zucheng (counter), (Song Cunde), Sun Hanzhang (counter) (Zhang Yande) Zhu Yuanlin (counter), Ye Tiechen (counter), (Yan Tongde), Gao Meiqing (counter) (Taishan Tang) (West New Bridge) Fan Qinfu (knife) Zhao Xiaofu (counter) (Guangshengtang), Tong Baokang (counter), (Caizhitang), Wang Shouting (counter), (Yan Dasheng), Yang Binyue (counter) (Liu Shouquan), Zhou Yaoting (counter), Gu Quanfa (counter), (Jishengtang), Fang Fusheng (counter), Sha Shaoqing (knife) (Tianjitang), Chen Jinzhang (knife), (Chao Yuqing) Shi Chunhui (counter), (Zhang Hengde), Zhang Zhenhui (counter), (Tong Baoyuan), Zhou Hongquan (counter), (Tiandetang), Sun Kaiyuan (knife), (Dexintang), Chen Shanzhang (counter), (Tong Shou Kang), Qiu Wangzhou (knife), (Zhong Jiuru) Guo Yuankang (knife), (Sanhetang), Kong Kailin (counter), Feng Wanchun, Ying Denghua (knife) (Ye Shude) (Li Huaifang) (counter) (Tong Liangxin) Liu Shuiliang (knife) (Zhang Tianyi) Chen Youlin (knife) Qian Zhongde () Gu Mingsheng (counter), (3) The aforementioned employees must report to work uniformly at 9:00 AM on March 25th, and the stores must not refuse them. (4) Unemployed members of the Pharmaceutical Workers Union who have been deemed unqualified by the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs, such as Xie Dezi and 50 others, should be given severance pay of 20 yuan each by the Preparatory Committee of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association to facilitate their dismissal. [Reason] The Pharmaceutical Workers Union, due to the busyness of employed workers who suffer from mental stress, and the difficult lives of unemployed workers who suffer from economic oppression, proposed relief measures and petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Municipal Party Headquarters to order the management to hire more workers to accommodate unemployed workers. The Bureau of Social Affairs ordered the unemployed workers in the industry to register first, and then together with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Civil Training Committee,</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>drafted eight review standards to examine the qualifications of the registered unemployed workers. The initial review resulted in 67 people being deemed qualified, 64 people requiring investigation, and 51 people being unqualified. The Civil Training Committee and the Bureau of Social Affairs then jointly dispatched people to conduct a thorough investigation of those who required investigation, and most of them were also found to be qualified. Later, after an inspection by the Municipal Party Chief for a period of time, it was also discovered that among the 67 people who had passed the review, Han Zuxin and Chen Yongxian were key members of the Pharmaceutical Workers Mutual Aid Society organized by the Communist Party, and Qin Falong, Qiu Zijiang, Qiu Rongchun, Zhong Zhifang, Xu Fukang, Feng Junda, Ye Qixiang, Yang Guangcai, and Zhang Huaqing, a total of nine people, had changed to other occupations and would not be given relief. Instead, 11 people who had not registered, including Zhou Yaseng, Sun Kaide, Chen Shanzhang, Qiu Wangzhou, Guo Yuankang, Kong Kailin, Ying Denghua, Li Huaifang, Liu Shuiliang, Chen Fanglin, and Gu Mingsheng, were added. In total, 131 unemployed workers were deemed qualified according to the review standards. Except for the two people already hired by Jiang Yanze for recording purposes and one person hired by Zhou Baifu, there are still 128 people who should be given relief. The Bureau of Social Affairs and the Civil Training Committee repeatedly sent people to secretly investigate the business situation of various pharmaceutical stores and the economic conditions of unemployed pharmaceutical workers. They learned that each prescription at Hu Qing Yu Tang, Tong Han Chun, Cai Tongde, and other pharmacies took more than four hours to be filled. Smaller stores such as Wang Daji, Ye Tiande, and Xi Liangji also took two to three hours to fill each prescription. If it was a chronic illness, it wouldn't matter, but in the case of an acute illness, such as meningitis, how could the patient wait for four hours or two to three hours? The so-called "medicine cures the illness" was almost becoming an empty phrase. Moreover, each prescription took four hours to fill, so the busyness of the workers can be imagined. Due to the busyness, mistakes were inevitable, and it was difficult to avoid mistakes in the medicine, which harmed people's lives. As a result, there were frequent cases of patients negotiating with stores due to errors in the medicine. Therefore, based on the principle that medicine is used to treat illnesses, all pharmacies with thriving businesses should consider the circumstances and hire more staff to avoid harming patients and to reduce the mental stress on existing workers. The fact that current employees were willing to strike to demand that stores hire unemployed workers was likely motivated by this. When the committee convened for mediation, the management representatives stated that since the government had issued an order for the management to give priority to hiring, the management naturally could not accept the placement. However, the meaning of the four words "give priority to hiring" means that when the management has the need to hire employees for business reasons, they should give priority to hiring the unemployed workers. The intention is very clear. If, as the management claimed, they only needed to wait until a store fired someone and then choose one of the unemployed workers to fill the vacancy in order to be considered as complying with the "give priority to hiring" requirement, then would it be possible to ask whether all pharmacies in the city would never hire employees again regardless of the business situation, and whether newly opened pharmacies could not hire employees? According to common sense, this is not reasonable. Therefore, what needs to be resolved now is whether, based on the current business situation of the pharmacies, there is still no need to hire more employees. The pharmaceutical industry management, regardless of its business situation, only knew to call for rejection of the placement, and did not mention whether there was a need to hire more employees, and even refused the Party Headquarters' call for consultation, which aroused the strike and caused great losses, which is very regrettable. The committee believes that at a time when epidemics are rampant, the strike trend cannot be allowed to continue. The original employees should resume work uniformly at 9:00 AM on March 25th, with wages paid as usual for the strike period. Although the operating surpluses of 53 pharmacies, including Hu Qing Yu Tang, varied last year, their thriving businesses and the busyness of their employees were similar. For the sake of social welfare, it is believed that they all have the need to hire more workers. The 128 unemployed workers, including Zheng Xizhou, who have been examined and qualified by the Civil Training Committee and the Bureau of Social Affairs, should be ordered to be hired separately by the respective stores. These newly hired employees must also report to work uniformly at 9:00 AM on the 25th. This will enable prescriptions to be filled more quickly than before, reducing losses for patients, and slightly relieving the economic oppression of unemployed workers. The committee believes that this approach not only coincides with the principles of developing industry and supporting labor, but also contributes to social security. Based on the above reasons, with the consent and signatures of the majority of the committee members, a decision is hereby made as the main text. Chairman of the Committee Guo Yongxi (seal), Committee Member Hou Dachun (signature), Committee Member Zhang Shouchun (seal), Committee Member Zhao Zhenhui (signature), Committee Member Fang Qingjian (signature), Committee Member Zhuang Meitang, Committee Member Zhang Zhihao, Recorder Wang Zhiqin, Ordered on March 24th of the 19th year of the Republic of China.</p>

It is said that when Chiang returns to Shanghai from Ningbo, he will still go to the fortress for inspection. At 9:00 AM yesterday, Fortress Commander Deng Zhenquan instructed all officers and ordered soldiers to strictly guard the defenses and prepare to welcome Commander-in-Chief Chiang during the weekly memorial service.

<p>▲ Under Review and Drafting by the Central Government</p>
<p>The joint office of more than 30 commercial groups such as peddlers and brokers in Shanghai previously sent representatives Zhou Kexin and Qin Xieyi to Nanjing to petition the central ministries and departments to approve the organization of trade associations or to promulgate street regulations to provide relief. It is now heard that the representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is said that when they went to the Central Party Headquarters, they were received by Yu Wenrui, Secretary of the Training Department, who stated that small business groups were not fundamentally unable to be organized.

When petitioning the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, they were received by Bao Zhi, Section Chief of the Commercial Affairs Section, and then met at the private residence of Zhang Yiou, Director of the Commercial Affairs Department.

<h3>Wu Yourong Seeks Liberation for Overseas Chinese in Taiwan</h3>
<p>▲ Letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Wu Yourong, representative of the overseas Chinese on the whole island of Taiwan, received a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that it was directly replying to the letter from Ye Yunxiang and others regarding the exaction of fees by the passport-issuing authorities for overseas Chinese going to Taiwan, and requesting that it be forwarded to the Fujian Provincial Government. The Ministry has recently formulated interim measures for the issuance of passports, which are universally implemented by all passport-issuing authorities. These authorities should charge fees in accordance with the regulations and should not make any further demands. According to these measures, workers are treated very favorably and are charged only half the fee. Overseas Chinese going to Taiwan should also weigh the advantages and disadvantages and should no longer obtain passports from the Nankoku Company, which would only be self-humiliating. In addition to informing the Fujian Provincial Government to take concrete action, it is hereby informed for your reference and to inform Ye Yunxiang and others to instruct the overseas Chinese going to Taiwan to be sure to apply for passports in accordance with the regulations in the future. To Wu Yourong, representative of the overseas Chinese on the whole island of Taiwan, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>▲ Representative's Suggestion: Wu Yourong, representative of the overseas Chinese on the whole island of Taiwan, telegraphed the Taiwan Chinese General Association stating, to all executive committee members of the Taiwan Chinese General Association and all executive committee members of all Taiwan associations, and to all overseas Chinese, may the above information be known. The previous letter requested that the reply letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs be forwarded to all overseas Chinese to apply for passports in accordance with the regulations in the future and to no longer obtain passports from the Nankoku Company, which would only be self-humiliating. It is hoped that you have received and transmitted the instructions. Regarding the establishment of a consulate, I have repeatedly urged the Central National Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and it is now under negotiation and will be realized soon. As for the educational affairs of the Taiwanese overseas Chinese, I have repeatedly stated to the Ministry of Education the various forms of oppression by the Taiwanese government and asked for instructions. Today's newspaper reports that the Ministry of Education consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 20th, requesting that the Japanese government be negotiated not to interfere with the education of the Taiwanese overseas Chinese. It can be seen that the government cares for the Taiwanese overseas Chinese in every possible way. I am very pleased to hear this news. I hope that the General Association and local associations will actively carry out education for the overseas Chinese and select outstanding children to come to the country to study in order to achieve great achievements. I have found that the Taiwanese government has always had various unequal and harsh laws in its treatment of overseas Chinese, which is completely different from its treatment of other foreigners. Now that the abolition and revision of the Sino-Japanese treaty are in preparation, I believe that my General Association should extract these harsh laws that abuse overseas Chinese one by one, add explanations, and draft a detailed petition to be sent to Shanghai, so that it can be presented to the Central National Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in person. When negotiations begin in the future, they can be handled together to avoid the trouble of separate negotiations in the future. Also, I believe that my Taiwanese overseas Chinese have few communication channels in the country and are very isolated in everything. Although I have tried my best to promote and publicize in recent years, my personal talent and ability are limited, and due to economic oppression, I have not been able to travel back and forth between China and Taiwan frequently to discuss everything in person, which has hindered progress. I believe that each association on the island should bear the expenses on a monthly basis and select a number of cadres to work between Nanjing and Shanghai to engage in liaison, publicity, guidance, and reception work. This would be of some help to the future of the liberation of the Taiwanese overseas Chinese. My humble opinion, is it appropriate, please make a public decision. Wu Yourong (seal).</p>
<h3>Report on Relief Work in Eastern Zhejiang by the Joint Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee received a telegram yesterday from the Linhai Relief Office stating that after investigation, the disaster in Linhai County is widespread and severe, with approximately 80,000 people in dire need of relief to survive. Among them, about 50,000 to 60,000 people are in the coastal disaster areas. In addition to the winter relief already distributed, there are about 20,000 to 30,000 people in the urban area and various townships who have not yet received assistance due to insufficient funds. The office has held meetings and decided to distribute aid one by one. The situation of borrowing silver dollars for distribution in the urban area was previously reported by telegram. Upon receiving 5,000 silver dollars, the investigators were urged to complete their investigations in various townships by February 28th, and distribution stations were set up in different districts for supervised distribution. According to reports from the relief workers, from February 28th to March 8th, disaster victims with tickets came to the stations to receive relief, and the amounts were disbursed accordingly. In this statistic, a total of 8,000 "fairness" relief tickets were issued, and more than 4,700 silver dollars were distributed. Expenses for investigation travel and station supplies totaled about 200 dollars. A detailed report will be submitted after all relief tickets are collected. The disaster situation in Linhai County is the most severe in all of Zhejiang. With spring plowing approaching, seeds are completely lacking, and countless hungry people are fleeing. Once they return, they will have no capital for cultivation, and their livelihoods will be cut off, inevitably endangering public order, with significant repercussions. Therefore, it is earnestly requested that an additional 20,000 dollars be allocated for spring relief to enable the disaster victims to live and prevent the loss of the spring planting season. We respectfully request approval and implementation, awaiting orders with utmost urgency. Hou Changling, Chief Director, and Wen Lesheng, Deputy Director, Shanghai Joint Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee, Linhai Relief Office, bow in cold weather.</p>
<h3>Summary of Relief Work in Jiangsu Province by the Jisheng Society</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society reports that the disaster areas in Jiangsu Province are in urgent need, especially Baoying County, which has been most severely affected. The suffering of the people, displaced and wandering, is beyond description. The society, having already handled relief in Zhejiang, felt that Jiangsu and Zhejiang were interdependent and could not be abandoned. A relief meeting decided to publicly recommend Liu Shulun to preside over the matter, who departed with relief workers immediately. The society also stated that the relief needed in Jiangsu was greater, and financial support was more difficult to obtain. Jiangsu Province is not lacking in enthusiastic philanthropists who, for the sake of saving their homeland, will certainly offer assistance to complete this grand endeavor.</p>
<h3>Baoying County Executive Committee Comes to Shanghai to Beg for Relief</h3>
<p>▲ A Detailed Account of the Disaster Situation in the Past Two Years</p>
<p>Baoying County has experienced two years of famine, with an extraordinarily severe disaster situation, unprecedented among the counties of Jiangsu Province. In the countryside, most of the disaster victims are filling their stomachs with grass roots and tree bark, resulting in the death of many young and strong people. The County Executive Committee resolved to send Committee Member Hu Yuzhang to Shanghai to appeal to all parties. Mr. Hu arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is staying at the New Huizhong Hostel on Sanma Road. The letter from the County Executive Committee to the Jiangsu Provincial Temporary Relief Committee is recorded below: To begin, our county has suffered from consecutive years of famine, especially last autumn. In the eastern townships, nine out of ten households are empty. Strong young men are scattered in all directions, displaced and destitute. The elderly, weak, women, and children are unable to move or beg for food, and are forced to fill their stomachs with grass roots and tree bark. Their faces are swollen, and countless numbers are filling ditches. In this period between harvests, the situation is deteriorating daily. Although charitable individuals from various parties have provided relief funds, it is like a drop in the bucket and cannot provide even a fraction of the necessary aid. We have long admired your committee's spirit of universal love, and earnestly request that you generously provide relief and swift assistance. On behalf of the disaster victims, we bow our heads nine times in supplication. In addition to resolving to send Committee Member Yuzhang to your committee to personally explain everything, we are sending this letter to request your attention and assistance.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Exempts All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association from Taxes on Domestic Goods Advertisements</h3>
<p>▲ Handling Fees Charged According to Regulations</p>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association in Shanghai, in order to solicit supplies and promote domestic goods, jointly organized a temporary domestic goods market at the Penglai Market with domestic goods groups. They printed large, low-price advertisements and requested the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to exempt them from advertising taxes. The bureau, considering its charitable nature, replied that it would completely exempt the advertising tax, but would charge handling fees according to regulations to subsidize government registration and stamping costs. Regarding the association's complaint in the letter that the Shanghai South Advertisement Management Office was creating difficulties for domestic goods advertisements, it also attached a statement. The original letter is as follows: In reply to your letter of March 17th, along with the attached advertisement sample, we acknowledge receipt. Although the central government has issued an order to exempt domestic goods advertisements from taxes, it stipulates that luxury goods and entertainment products should still be taxed according to regulations. The goods listed in your market still include a portion of luxury goods and entertainment products, so the advertisements cannot be completely exempted from taxes. Moreover, the matter of exempting domestic goods advertisements in this city is still under discussion and is being referred to the municipal government for instructions. However, since your market is established to save disaster victims, which is a charitable endeavor, the advertising tax can be completely exempted. As for handling fees, according to Article 16 of the city's Advertising Management Regulations, all tax-exempt advertisements must pay handling fees. The purpose of this fee is to subsidize government registration and stamping costs, so the amount is very small and does not impose a significant burden on merchants. Furthermore, regarding your letter's indication that our bureau's Advertising Management Office is creating difficulties for your market's advertisements, we have found that the office can only enforce the regulations when stamping and purchasing, and has no authority to change or obstruct matters. There may be a misunderstanding. Therefore, we are responding to the above and hope that you will continue to handle matters in accordance with the regulations. This is addressed to the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association Temporary Domestic Goods Market Committee.</p>
<h3>Former Board of Directors Contracts of the China Merchants Bureau are Invalid</h3>
<p>According to news from the General Management Office of the China Merchants Bureau, since sending people to take over the Jiyu Company, the manager of the company, Li Guojie, has not yet handed over matters. However, the General Management Office has announced that all contracts of the China Merchants Bureau must be approved by the General Management Office to be effective. Therefore, those who previously entered into contracts with the former Board of Directors are requesting the General Management Office to approve or ratify them. The Tongyi Bank of this city, which had borrowed money for the construction of warehouses, had entered into a contract with the former manager of Jiyu Company, Li Guojie. After seeing the announcement posted by the General Management Office, it sent a letter to the General Management Office requesting approval. After receiving the letter, the General Management Office has sent someone to enter into a new contract, which has been reported to the supervisor.</p>
<h3>Red Wood Workers Demand Wage Increase</h3>
<p>The red wood workers of this city convened all the workers yesterday to discuss wage increase methods. After investigating the wages of various groups of workers, the workers reported the wage situation of each group. The workers believed that the wages of various groups have increased in recent years, but only their group has not received a wage increase. Last year, they requested this from the shop owners, but they used the excuse of slow business to dodge and evade the issue. After investigating, all the workshops are now hiring additional workers, and the business is not bad, so wages should be increased immediately. Moreover, the wages they set are the lowest. Most wages are calculated by piecework, and only a few are paid monthly. After discussion, it was decided that the wage level should be the same as other groups. They are now printing leaflets listing the wages set by other groups and distributing them to the shop owners, and will demand a wage increase, with a deadline of five days for a response. Representatives will also be sent to the shop owners to explain everything and request prompt approval to ensure peace of mind at work.</p>

<h3>Case of Death in a Hotel</h3>
<p>▲ Guo Jinhua and Lu Fengzhi</p>
<p>▲ Love Suddenly Encounters Obstacles</p>
<p>▲ Hand in Hand, They Seek Death in a Hotel</p>
<p>▲ Guo is Dead, Lu Can Still be Saved</p>
<p>Guo Jinhua, a 25-year-old man from Zhongshan, Guangdong, checked into Room 447 of a large hotel on Nanjing Road the afternoon before yesterday with his lover. Guo was dressed in Western clothes and was very handsome, while the woman, claiming to be surnamed Tang, had short hair, leather shoes, and fashionable clothes. Guo registered on the guest register under the alias Huang Zhihua. The tea boy, seeing their lavish behavior, assumed they were from a wealthy family and did not pay much attention to them. Guo and his girlfriend went out again at 9:00 p.m. the night before and came back with many kinds of fruits, laughing as usual. Then, they closed the door and tried to go to sleep. At about 9:00 a.m. yesterday morning, the tea boy and others heard the sound of vomiting from Room 447. Realizing that something might be wrong, they pounded on the door, but there was no response. The tea boy reported to the cashier, who climbed into the room through the transom above the door. He saw that the man's face was pale and his breath had stopped, while the woman was also dying and could still be saved. The hotel staff then reported to the Lao Zha police station. After receiving the news, the police chief immediately ordered Chinese detectives to investigate. They found a Lysol bottle on the table, indicating a severe overdose. Several business cards were found on his body, signed Guo Jinhua. Only then did they realize that Huang Zhihua on the guest register was not his real name. The body was then sent to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. Since the woman was still breathing, the detectives immediately sent a patrolman to accompany her to the Guangren Hospital for treatment. After several injections of life-saving drugs by the doctor, she slightly regained consciousness. She said her name was Lu Fengzhi, also from Guangdong. This suicide was due to obstacles in love, which prevented a satisfactory outcome, so they resorted to this strategy.</p>
<h3>Petitioning Group of Monks from the Shousheng Temple</h3>
<p>▲ Shousheng Temple is Limited to Move Today</p>
<p>▲ More than One Hundred Monks are Greatly Alarmed</p>
<p>▲ Marching in Formation with Incense to Petition</p>
<p>▲ A Strange Sight at the Provisional Court Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shousheng Temple on Beijing Road and the Huzhou Society organized by Huzhou people in Shanghai are involved in a lawsuit in the Provisional Court over the temple's land for many years. The Huzhou Society wanted to rebuild the temple into the Ying Shi (ie, Chen Qimei, the former Shanghai military governor) Memorial Hall. The Provisional Court has ruled that the abbot of the temple, Di Ming, etc., should move out. Di Ming refused to accept and filed an appeal. The Court of Appeal again posted a notice on the 15th of this month rejecting the appeal of the monks Di Ming, etc., against the decision to move out, and the appellant was responsible for the appeal costs. The court issued an order on the 19th, setting a deadline of the 25th of this month for the move. After receiving the order, the monks of the temple were greatly alarmed, and the abbot Di Ming was especially anxious. They believed that once they moved, more than one hundred monks would lose their place to live, and the pain of being displaced would be deeply felt. They once gathered all the monks in the temple to discuss ways to try to save the situation. As a result, they decided that all the monks in the temple would hold incense and go to the Provisional Court to petition. The petition banners were prepared the day before yesterday. The banners were made of white paper, rectangular in shape, with the four characters [Huzhou Fellow Townsmen] written horizontally at the top, and then the following written vertically: [Do not speak of justice. Confiscate temple property.], [Do not speak of humanity. Confiscate Shousheng],</p>
<p>[Private property of the temple.], [Powerful forces. Monks have no resistance.]. The lines were divided into two or three lines. Until ten o'clock yesterday morning, the petitioning group elected three monks, Di Ming, Mao Lin, and Fa Cheng, as leaders. Each held a lit incense stick in their right hand and a banner in their left hand. They departed from the Shousheng Temple in formation, followed Zhejiang Road, passed the old Garbage Bridge, and went straight to the Provisional Court, lining up on the pavement inside the gate. This monk petitioning group was still a first in the concession. Therefore, the viewers stood around like a wall in an instant. These one hundred and several dozen monks also complained to everyone they met. Then, the three leaders, Di Ming, etc., went up to the second floor to visit the president to hand over the petition in person, requesting a solution to the housing problem. The doorman informed them that President Xu was not in the court at the moment. Therefore, the three monks went back downstairs and talked with their companions. Some advocated waiting for the president to come to the court before submitting the request again. Later, the court instructed the three monks, Di Ming, Mao Lin, and Fa Cheng, to temporarily rest in the rest room behind the first courtroom. At around eleven o'clock, they had still not met the president. The three leaders then followed the instructions of a certain clerk who was responsible for the reception and sent the petition held by Mao Lin to the receiving and dispatch office, requesting that it be forwarded. After the receiving and dispatch office gave a receipt, they left with the two monks, Di Ming and Fa Cheng, to the pavement, explained the situation, and still led the monks, holding incense and banners, back to the temple in an orderly manner to await a solution.</p>
<h3>Monk of Wanfu Temple Extorted</h3>
<p>▲ Monks Make Things Difficult for Monks</p>
<p>▲ Negotiations Open at the Juelu Hotel</p>
<p>▲ Three Hundred Dollars Not Lost</p>
<p>▲ Extortion Crime Imprisonment for Two Months</p>
<p>The monk Jie Chan, whose registered residence is in Dongtai, is a 35-year-old abbot of the Wanfu Temples in southern Chengdu for many years. The temple is very popular, and there are many who covet it. At 7:30 a.m. the day before yesterday, Dao Feng, the former abbot of the Taiping Temple (surname Shen, from Hefei, 59 years old), and two men in short clothes, A and B, arrived by car at the Wanfu Temple. A got out of the car first and invited Jie Chan out to talk. He was lured into the car and driven to the entrance of the Jue Lu Hotel on Xizang Road. They got out of the car together and entered Room 56 of the hotel. Using intimidating tactics, they demanded a thousand gold coins. Jie Chan, being in their sphere of influence, agreed to give a hundred gold coins. Then one side backed down, and the other side increased the demand. At that time, they negotiated three hundred dollars. The abbot Jie Chan wrote two IOUs, one for two hundred dollars and one for one hundred dollars, to Dao Feng, and then was allowed to regain his freedom. After Jie Chan left the hotel, he felt that remaining silent would not prevent future troubles. He reported to the Xinzha Police Station. The police chief sent detective Zhang Ankang and Western detectives to investigate and found that Dao Feng was hiding at 372 Yunhua Lane, Caishi Road in the French Concession. They went to arrest Dao Feng together with the French police and searched and found the two IOUs written by Jie Chan. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Provisional Court, where Luo, the judge, conducted the trial. Jie Chan stated the situation of the defendant colluding with others to extort money. Later, the waiter of the Jue Lu Hotel was also summoned to testify, saying that the defendant had come to open Room 56 at the time, claiming to be surnamed Zhang. Zhu Genrong, a temple helper from Wanfu Temple, testified that the defendant and two men in short clothes came to invite the abbot out the morning before, and when I heard the news and chased out of the temple, the defendant and others had already driven the abbot away in a car. The car number was not identified. When asked about Dao Feng's confession, he said that he had a good impression of Jie Chan. In June of the previous year, when I was the abbot of Taiping Temple, the plaintiff boarded in my temple. Because he was economically strapped, I lent him two hundred dollars. Later, the Taiping Temple was closed by the authorities. In April of last year, I boarded at the Wanfu Temple, which the plaintiff was abbot of, and was borrowed another one hundred dollars. Neither of the two loans were documented. Recently, I heard that Jie Chan did not abide by the precepts, took a wife and concubines, and was addicted to opium. He set up a brothel, but the loans had not been repaid. Therefore, I went to the temple the day before yesterday to ask for them back. Since it was inconvenient in the temple, I invited him to the Jue Lu. The plaintiff then voluntarily wrote the IOU, it was not forced by me. Judge Luo understood that the monk's confession was completely false and immediately sentenced Dao Feng to two months in prison for attempted extortion, and confiscated the two IOUs.</p>
<h3>A Youth in Western Clothing was Found Shot and Killed on Xizang Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>▲ A Note Found in His Pocket</p>
<p>▲ Seems to be a Warning to be Careful</p>
<p>▲ The Deceased Also Turns Out to be a Thug</p>
<p>▲ Cause of Assassination Not Yet Known</p>
<p>At half past two yesterday morning, a youth in Western clothing was found lying dead in Xiguiyang Lane on Xizang Road, his face covered in blood, and two shots in his leg. After a while, a rickshaw puller, Han Nangao, passed through the lane with a rubber-tired rickshaw. At first, he noticed a black shadow. Upon closer inspection, he saw that it was a person lying in a pool of blood. He was extremely frightened and shouted, running to report to the two Chinese policemen stationed at 1403 and 1450 Guangxi Road nearby. He led the two policemen back to the scene of the incident for inspection. The police reported to the Lao Zha Police Station by telephone, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives by car to start an investigation. Unfortunately, it was late at night, and it was difficult to determine whether anyone had witnessed or heard anything. Then, a note was found in the deceased's pocket. Judging from the words in the note, it seemed that someone was aware that an assassination would be carried out and was telling him to escape quickly. However, the note was not signed, so it was impossible to know who wrote the note. The name of the deceased was also not written in the note, so it has not been found out yet. In addition to taking the note back to the police station, the detectives had the body transported to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road by car. After 10:00 a.m., the judge commissioned by the Provisional Court arrived at the office for inspection, ascended to the public seat, and according to the police chief, the deceased was found to be a thug who was involved in theft when he was alive. This killing may be a case of thugs killing each other or related to a theft case. However, it is still under investigation. Then, the rickshaw puller Chen Shuti recounted his discovery of the body and reported it to the police. The judge then ordered Pushan Villa to provide a guarantee and take the body away for burial.</p>
<h3>Soldiers Hidden in a Pile of Bricks</h3>
<p>▲ There is a Mauser Pistol in the Cement Pillar</p>
<p>▲ The Coal Shop Owner Seized the Opportunity to Escape</p>
<p>The Guanj Coal Shop at 837 Dongyouheng Road was found to be hiding military fire. The afternoon before yesterday, Yang A-quan, the detective chief of the Harbin Police Station, and detective Zhou Kai-wen drove to search it. They found a Mauser pistol and 112 bullets in a pile of bricks in the store. They also saw eight cement pillars in the patio, each about four feet long and five inches wide, which seemed suspicious. They used iron tools to break five of the pillars and did not find any contraband. The remaining three were not destroyed. These pillars were deposited by Yao Asheng, a former special agency detective. The police station reported that Yao had bullets stored in the pillars, so they destroyed them upon seeing them. However, the coal shop owner, Han Changmao from Jiangbei, had seized the opportunity to escape. Therefore, Li Changsheng, his watchman, was taken back to the police station along with the guns, bullets, and stone pillars. Later, Wang Sanzi, a person involved, was arrested on Disui Road. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Provisional Court. Han Changmao also surrendered to the court with his attorney Ye Fukang. Judge Xu conducted the trial. Wang Sanzi confessed that he used to be a driver at Yao Detective's house. In March of the previous year, a friend of Yao brought three Mauser pistols and placed them on the table. Yao and his friend were talking quietly, their voices low so that others could not hear them. Two weeks later, the friend came again and brought eight cement pillars. Yao ordered someone to make one more pillar like the others and ordered me to send them to the Guanj Coal Shop for deposit. Han was not in the store at the time, so he contacted Han's brother. Li Changsheng confessed that the shopkeeper ordered him to take out one of the nine stone pillars and break it the morning before, and he saw a wooden case for a Mauser pistol at one end and an iron box at the other end. He did not know what was in the box. When questioned, Han Changmao confessed that the stone pillars had been deposited for many years. The morning before, Li Changsheng wanted to move them, and one of the pillars broke, revealing a Mauser pistol and more than one hundred bullets. He was afraid and hid them in a pile of bricks. Attorney Ye also requested that Han be released on bail. Judge Xu ordered that Han be detained and that Wang and Li each pay a bail of 500 yuan and be interrogated again at a later date after the investigation is clear.</p>

<p>Qiu Hao, the beautiful maid of Tang Rui, a Cantonese merchant on Fusheng Road in Zhabei, was in love with the teacher Deng Fuhua, and stole jewelry worth more than 3,000 gold from her mistress, Guo, and fled. The case of their arrest has been reported previously. It is now known that Zheng Fuhua became ill on the 14th of this month at the Cantonese Merchants Hospital. When the police arrested him, the people in the hospital said that the person was seriously ill and could not come to court. Therefore, Zheng found a store guarantor for 3,000 yuan to ensure that he would come to court for questioning after he recovered from his illness. Qiu Hao also confessed that Ah Feng, a tea boy at the school, was the one who collected the jewelry. The Ah Feng arrested by the police station was Chen Afu, a tea boy at the hospital. When questioned, Qiu Hao pointed out that it was him, but Chen Afu strongly denied it. Therefore, the police station transferred the case to the local court yesterday, and he was taken into custody to await investigation.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Separation and Reunion of a Couple of Ten Days</h3>
<p>Han Wu, a woman from Anhui, is currently 58 years old and lives in Lujia Weir, Maogong Bridge, Longhua. She has one son and one daughter. The daughter, Wen Shu, also known as Mao Tou (now known as Ji Han), is currently 24 years old. After her husband died, she lived a hard life. In the Republic of China in 1928, Wen Shu married Ji Ke Gong (currently 25 years old), who lives in Xizhen, Old Longhua, as his wife at the behest of her parents and the words of the matchmaker. Ji is currently employed in the Transportation Corps First Regiment Wireless Communications First Team Headquarters of the Army, Navy and Air Force Headquarters. They married on October 29 of the same year. Before ten days had passed, he packed up and went to work in Hankou, Guangdong, and other places. He often wrote to his parents, expressing his unwillingness about this marriage and repeatedly wanting to break the marriage. He also wrote to his wife, willing to change his wife into a brother-sister relationship, advising his wife to marry someone else to avoid delaying her youth. However, Wen Shu was extremely stubborn, saying that once married, she would be married forever and that a woman would not marry twice. Ji Ke Gong has been away from home for several years and has not returned to Shanghai. The woman had no choice but to return to her brother and sister-in-law's house in Ning to live and work for a living. Recently, because Ji Ke Gong came to Shanghai, his wife repeatedly sought to meet him but could not, and expressed her determination to break the marriage. Therefore, Wen Shu hired a lawyer yesterday to draft a complaint and filed it with the Shanghai Local Court, requesting that the court order them to live together as husband and wife and to order him to bear the cost of maintenance in order to maintain her livelihood.</p>
<h3>Divorce Problems of an Elderly Couple</h3>
<p>▲The final debate was announced yesterday</p>
<p>Mrs. Wu, the wife of Liu Dongsheng, a Suzhou native and owner of Quan Chang Zhu Diamond Store on Avenue Edward VII, is 57 years old. She claims that when she married Liu, he was only 21 years old and working as a shop assistant at Lao Jie Fu Silk Store in Shanghai with a monthly salary of two yuan. Therefore, she provided the dowry and instructed Liu to start a jewelry business. In a few years, they became moderately wealthy, but Liu suddenly forgot the wife who had seen him through hard times and took Tao as a concubine. Liu always favored and protected his concubine, making it impossible for Mrs. Wu to live at home. Last year, she hired a lawyer to sue Liu in the Provisional Court, requesting a maintenance fee of 30,000 yuan. Liu is now over sixty years old, and the white-haired couple frequently appeared in court. The judge, seeing that both parties were already old, suggested that they could grow old together and advised them to settle out of court. Unexpectedly, both old people were stubborn and unwilling to compromise, so mediation was difficult. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide resumed the trial. Mrs. Wu first stated that the settlement had failed because the defendant was insincere. She then requested that the defendant be ordered to pay a one-time maintenance fee of 30,000 yuan or 80 yuan per month. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff had no intention of settling and that she had taken everything with her when she left home. Judge Feng still advised both parties to settle in court and provide some financial support to the plaintiff, but the defendant refused. He then summoned the witness Feng Yunhai for questioning. According to Feng, Liu did not share a room with the plaintiff, so the plaintiff had no choice but to leave. The witness also described in detail the ferocity of Liu's concubine, Tao. Then the debate began. After the lawyers for both sides finished their arguments, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>The Case of Liu Ling Beating His Apprentice to Death Concludes</h3>
<p>▲The demand for compensation is enormous</p>
<p>▲The parties failed to reach a settlement</p>
<p>Tao Jupeng (15 years old), a martial arts apprentice learning from the actor Li Ruiting, was entrusted to his uncle Liu Fuchu (also known as Liu Yuchun) for instruction last winter when Li went to Suzhou to perform. However, Liu was violent and would beat him severely if he was not satisfied, causing internal injuries to Jupeng. He became seriously ill on October 15th last year, and Liu sent someone to take him to Yongchuan Hospital, but he died before he could be treated. After Jupeng's mother, Tao Cao, reported the incident to the police, the Provisional Court investigated. The details have been reported in the newspaper. Tao Cao then sued Li Ruiting and Liu Fuchu in the Provisional Court. Liu avoided appearing in court, and the presiding judge acquitted Li and issued a warrant for Liu Fuchu's arrest for further interrogation. Hou Fulin, a Chinese detective from the Xinzha Police Station, arrested Liu at the Xianshi Rooftop Garden and detained him. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tan Xinzhen specially convened the First Court to resume the trial. The plaintiff's lawyer questioned the witness Li Tianbao. However, Li's testimony was inconsistent with his testimony at the autopsy. The plaintiff's lawyer stated to the court that Li's testimony was inconsistent and asked for attention. Dr. Wang Zhenchuan testified that the deceased had previously suffered from hemoptysis, which he had cured, and that his body was quite strong and had no diseases. However, when Tao was sent to his hospital, he was already dead. The autopsy revealed a blue mark about half an inch long on the deceased's leg and a similar injury on his lower abdomen. The cause of death was injury, but he could not prove what kind of injury was sustained. When questioned, Liu Fuchu denied beating Tao Jupeng to death. Judge Tan, seeing that the plaintiff Tao Cao's situation was quite pitiful, ordered Liu to provide some compensation. Liu claimed that he was poor and could not afford a large amount of compensation. However, the deceased's older sister, Tao Mengfei, claimed that Liu's family had a lot of property and that his mother specialized in lending money at high interest, earning thousands of yuan per month. Therefore, she demanded compensation of 24,000 yuan. The matter remained unresolved for a long time, but the settlement broke down due to the large difference in the amounts. After the lawyers for both sides finished their arguments, the court ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Woman Smuggles Firearms</h3>
<p>At about 11:00 PM the other night, Wang Shuxiu, an inspector of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's water patrol team, led police officers Cui Zhongshan, Zhang Jian, and Nie Mengqin on patrol along the river. When passing the Pudong surface of the Dada Wharf, they saw the Daji Steamboat berthed on the riverside and about to raise anchor. They immediately boarded the ship for inspection and found two Jiangbei women, Wu Zhang and Liu Li, in the cabin. Seeing the police team arrive, they immediately looked flustered. Because their behavior was highly suspicious, they immediately searched the two women and found three shell guns, one Browning pistol, and 350 bullets beside them. They took the witnesses back to the station. Director Xu proposed a preliminary hearing. The two women's testimonies were very cunning and they tried to evade responsibility. Since the case involved carrying firearms, which violated the prohibition, they were ordered to prepare a document together with the guns and bullets and submit it to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation and punishment.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Regarding the news item in your newspaper's local news column, [Investigation Reveals Reactionary Suspicions in Zhonggong Student Theft Case], which is inconsistent with the facts. The Wusong Seventh District Office came to our school on the 20th because a student had lost money, and they sent personnel to investigate. Several seals were found in student Deng Zhongbang's box. It has now been clarified that they were deposited by Huang Yao, a graduate of our school from the previous academic year. There is a Fudan Summer School certificate submitted by Huang Yao to the Academic Affairs Office as proof. The words engraved on the seals, [Socialism], [Famous Learning], [Chinese Economic Issues], etc., are all course titles and have no reactionary implications. Furthermore, since these seals were forged by Huang Yao, our school has already severely investigated the matter. As for the section in your newspaper stating that District Officer Li's testimony has reactionary implications, this is completely untrue. We hereby request that you make corrections. To the News Department of Shen Bao, Secretariat of China Public School, March 24.</p>
