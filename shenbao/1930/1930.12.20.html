<p>青　園地</p>
<p>我的夜漱英</p>
<p>紀念蘇讀餘君</p>
<p>兩月前曾寫過一篇短短的散文題名爲（夜）登在申報青年園地蘇讀餘君看了篇文字與以同情寫信要我告訴他的住址我和蘇君相距比鄰也許曾在路上遇見過但我久已離羣索居斷絶交往雖看見蘇君懇切的通信總躊躇於覆書以爲我是不足於交接的此後不到兩星期蘇君因病死去正在青青年紀他的生命之花的時候他的同學替他開了個追悼會我想去憑吊一下去望望那個不相　的朋友的遺容終於怕使人覺得太唐突而没有敢去如今距他死去又復一月了蘇君的事總耿耿在心不相識的朋友竟使人深深留戀人生總是這樣無端的人間的關係正如霧中行走只在大宇中看見一小小的　　有時候看見來人從霧影中透出來逐漸可以看得清楚等到交身而過望見眉目的時候他又要逐漸消失到霧裏面去了就是這短短的一瞬間使人執着不能忘懷則我草這陋文聊以紀念蘇君也非全然唐突的事罷</p>
<p>前次所寫的（夜）本來還有下篇一時興盡便不能再續下去了我是一個忙於生活的人本來無復閒情逸致去欣賞一切悠然的情趣十年來到處奔走從不曾得到一點可以休息的時候雖然年紀並不老大但風塵已經深印在我的額上了和我相見的人没有一個可以看出我實在的年齡的說起來也該還是青年郤不再能有青年的心性然而我究竟是出身鄉村的無論在都市裏流離了多麽久這些繁華富麗的生活於我總是陌生而夢想着那些遼遠的東西因爲謀生不能不覊旅上海也終偷偷地躲在離城中較遠的地方這就是我所以寫出那篇文字的原因了</p>
<p>在鄉村裏面最使人感到時序推移生命成長無論是春是秋或者萬物蕭索的冬天都有顯明的表徴印在原野印在風物印在天的顔色上面野草和樹葉都以一種輕靈的語言向你們說他們的遭遇有時候是和婉愛嬌有時候都是悄然長太息清晨早起寒夏經露讓　秋冬嚴霜凄然你的目所接觸脚所踏到都會融於那些生命之流一株一草一朶野花一粒沙石都展開情懐向你擁抱的但是你必須用空虚的心情去接受這一切惟有空虚的心情才可以感受到宇宙間的生命</p>
<p>四時流轉在永續的生命之靈看來也許是太單調了的罷但我們人生郤只有這短短的數十寒暑絶不會厭倦這是太多了的凝靜地觀察　們的過往探討其中消息也是增益我們的生命的一種方法在都市裏一切是轉變得太迅速了在另一意義則又歉其永住無動除非在馬路上看見繁華的人們換了新裝又誰能夠知道節序已在暗裏偷換了呢那們去問問小鳥去問問野草牠們會告訴你的暮春二月到處都是新筍成林的時候只要隔了幾天再去看那些危株獨立的幼小的東西都已枝成葉茁他們都到青年並且告訴你新夏的消息了春夏之交和秋冬之際正是大自然急激變動的時會一夜風色就會使人感覺到田野盡非故物了呢</p>
<p>有一次我獨自在園子裏望着大棵大棵的甘藍那决不是小菜攤子或廚師手裏的什麽東西立在我面前的郤是發揚着豐富生命的生物我驚異於　們之奇詭一些很大的葉子四散伸張正像母雞張開翅膀讓雞雛躱到那下面裏面的葉子一片一片捲起來捲得非常之緊有如隱藏着什麽深渺的心思不讓他人知道我忽然發生一種遐想想窺探一下那些深藏的胸懷裏面的秘密於是我伸手想輕輕揭開一片捲着的葉子那片葉子是以如此温柔而又嚴毅的神情拒絶我冷露傳着凉浸的感覺到我的指頭使我立刻漸愧了做了一件極不應該的事我的心深深顫振恰如我偷偷地去窺探了一個情人的心懷</p>
<p>本來是在外面流蕩慣了的故鄉裏早無牽涉没有我要關心的人也没有關心我的人了故鄉是怎麽樣的從來不曾想起但今年郤驀地相民想起故鄉風物然而究竟仔細思索也不過我想念田原的心情更加激動而已我所最想起的是野地那許多的花北地固然没有就是江南風景也遠遜那麽華艷春天野玫瑰野菊到處開着路旁籬邊無不被舖得滿滿的不獨穠麗而且芳澤紫雲英把整個的田隴都遮蓋了假如有一個君王在平原裏墊下十里紫彩的地氈無論如何還是會圇輸與這些小小的紫雲英的山上時時有蘭香襲人紅躑躅開得那樣多山面都看不見了牠在鄉下的名字是映山紅但最是發人幽思的是三月月明半夜獨坐在橘柚園中你不要動彈也不要思索讓月光如水流過你的胸懷橘柚小小的白花使全樹眞變白了的會不住地落到你身上給你織成一件芳香凝白的衣裳遠處有水車幽靜的聲音乃如情人的輕語這一切使你迷醉使你像沉入夢中</p>
<p>但是我現在郤在西北風起灰沙遍地的地方原野草枯萬物沉死只遠遠望見上海的衆烟突吐出黑色去詭的花紋夜裏是先施公司屋頂的紅色電燈宛如在向我獰視而我也勞碌於生活没有時間夢想了</p>
<p>我想再寫一篇（夜）那些美麗的寗靜的東西雖然蒼白郤甚可愛以安慰死者之靈但是我的單底下郤再流不出那樣的東西了我的夜枯寂凌亂僅僅偶然抬頭會看見了一些窗外的夜光也想丢下筆跑出去去看看月輝在天明霜遍地但我的心是緊灑的　這一點點餘暇剩情也没有了我想蘇君終於没有看見我那篇文字許還給他一點好的印象帶到永遠的長夜裏假如他有一天來了和我對坐在我的夜裏他大約會帶着一些幻滅的情趣回去了呢</p>
<p>生活不斷地把我捲　前進這一點點對於不相認的朋友的懷念我知道不久也就會消失了的也許這一篇文字偶然在包花生米或者什麽小物件的紙上給漠不相關的人看了而又引起他的輕微惆悵則永眠了的死者和我和那個陌生的人在生命上又引起一些牽涉了</p>
<p>現在應該放下筆去做一些旁的事了在旅途中彦文</p>
<p>參觀日記第一頁</p>
<p>籌備了兩個多星期的參觀終於在今天出發了現在我是開始寫我的參觀日記在首都金陵大學裏</p>
<p>昨晚還睡在江灣今晚却要睡在此地了人假如是交通便利的話他的命運一定會像飛鳥一般的東飄西蕩</p>
<p>早晨四點多鐘我就被同學呌醒了天還是烏黑的洗了臉吃過早飯才聽到起身鐘這要算這學期我第一次聽到的起身鐘我想到從前爲了第一二點鐘没有課歡喜睡懶覺的惡習來自已也覺得微微發笑一</p>
<p>然而今天我是聽到起身鐘了</p>
<p>從學校裏出發天空才微微發亮搬塲汽車載着我們在清晨的馬路上行走空氣是太新鮮了我坐在車頭上司機坐的地方看着剛聳睡夢中清醒過來的都</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>市還單在薄薄的霧氣裏心胸是從没有覺到那樣的寬暢汽車努力地衝開薄霧前進我們校裏的鐘樓終於漸漸地消失了消失在蒼茫的糢糊的稀薄的霧氣裏和我們作一度短時期的别離了</p>
<p>七點多鐘火車緩緩地在行走了偉大的都市東方的委尼斯罪惡的塲所漸漸　開我們也相偐我們暫别了天空這時無情飄着細毛雨從車窗中看出初冬的田野雖是零落得可憐但在厭棄了都市生活的我看來至少他是新鮮的那裏有東一塊西一塊點綴着的麦草那裏有在細雨中勞動着的農人那裏有一切都市中所不能看見的景像</p>
<p>爲着雨大家都很擔憂着</p>
<p>坐在車裏很無聊把帶來的小說月報八月號翻開來看看了一篇蒲年牢的豹子頭林冲萬曼的自由的意味和黃仲蘇的血據說浦牢就是茅盾他那篇豹子頭林冲描寫的技巧雖還不錯但是在舊小說找一點材料來寫文章豈不太無聊而且全篇没有什麽結構這我想只能呌做隨筆吧了萬曼的自由的意味更不知道寫的是什麽東西我不相信這樣的文</p>
<p>字居然會在小說月報上刋出黃仲蘇的血結構還好然而也不過是一篇戀愛故事而已對於國家對於社會我不知道他有什麽用處有什麽供獻小說月報眞的難道不肯自已振作嗎</p>
<p>我不願意再看下去再引起我無謂的感想了我去丢下了小說月報可是無聊又佔領了我的心頭</p>
<p>我轉過頭來向着窗外遠離的山林好像圍繞着我們旋轉附近的農民都停止了工作看着載我們前進的怪物然而天空的細雨還没有停止</p>
<p>幸而遇菊三瑞白和我們同行菊三還帶着十分孩子氣的氣三他常會裝出好笑的情氣和鬼臉逗着人家笑瑞白的情氣也常使我們開心這次他們倆碰在一起好笑的事情更多了瑞白講故事菊三唱璇宮艷史的ＩＬＯＶＥＹＯＵ的歌曲使我們坐的車廂裏充滿了笑的聲浪在笑聲裏驅除了我們無聯的寂寞而漸漸度過這漫漫的旅途</p>
<p>過鎭江時是兩點多鐘北固山金山又顯現在我的眼前鎭江要算是我的第二故鄉我住在鎭江有五年之久我寳貴的童年就是在鎭江度過的火車駛入鎭江車站的時候我的腦經又憧憬着兒時的景像啊啊離北固山不遠的地方是我的母校鎭中從前我們常常偷偷的爬下城牆到北固山去遊玩離南門不遠的地方是我那時的住所每當星期日的時候我和父親弟弟常常散步走出城門在嫩草上閒談着啊啊一切一切的往事都像走馬燈一般在我腦經裏又重温了一遍然而現在我父親已和我們長辭了我的兒童時的年華也早已輕輕逝去不能挽留回了唉思往事倍惆悵我深深陷在回憶之中我是加倍的覺到惆悵</p>
<p>我一個人靠着車窗上看車站上的一切彷彿那些都足以安慰我的惆悵都足已紀念我亡故了的父親和我消逝了兒時的年華可是火車又在行動了鎭江車站上的一切又脫離我的視線了</p>
<p>我哭我眞想哭然而我終于没有哭出聲來遥遥地看着脫離了我的視線的鎭江和我已經有三年别離的山明水秀的鎭江不知道什麽時候才能再投入她的懐抱就算縱然我有那樣一天會再投入她懷抱再受她温存的撫育然而我的青春畢竟已經消逝得不能再反了再縱然我的青春能夠再反縱然年華倒流兒時可再我也没有方法可以再尋到我慈愛的父親了</p>
<p>惆悵煩惱我惆悵我更煩腦一直以現在寫這篇日記的時候</p>
<p>到南京時已是四點鐘再坐着爬虫般的小火車進城到金陵大學已是六點多鐘了金陵的同學很客氣的招待我們我們心裏覺得非常感激並且不由人不想起同是國立大學的中大拒絶我們借宿的事來</p>
<p>晚上在飯館裏吃了飯因爲一天没有吃到飯肚子餓極了不覺吃了五小啘飯回金大時天又下雨了討厭</p>
<p>海上倩曼</p>
<p>一葉孤舟</p>
<p>蕩漾在吳淞口頭西風緊緊</p>
<p>直括得我胆戰心驚</p>
<p>人們的不齒說是</p>
<p>賤微之事漁夫之業</p>
<p>吁夢囈中的狂論</p>
<p>亦曾知東隣之敵所以强盛</p>
<p>的確的事實國人對於水産事業一殷都存着輕視的心理講到關於鼓吹宣傳的又字更是絶無僅有倒還是什麽東宮西宮中的宮主們的消息時常有她們的艷跡在報端難道水産生活眞没有一談的價值云</p>
<p>那一片浩浩蕩蕩的天空碧沉沉的無邊無際呼呼的風吹得那輕而快的白雲祗在東南西北不住的飄颺那一邊又是一片白茫茫的海洋非常深也非常廣闊這樣身壯的浪濤啊不住地濠濠騰騰纒繞着任性的奔放和跳躍這好偉大的吳淞江這裏也有松柏齊天花木茂盛的園景偌大的運動塲也足夠健兒們小獻身手啊我們的校址水産就在這海闊天空的淞濱微然的聳峙着</p>
<p>水産的生活是美滿的豐富的不是枯燥而無味的是偏重實習的不專事空談的我們與漁撈製造兩科除之每天照</p>
<p>常的受課外在某一的規定時間是我們實習的機會</p>
<p>每晨春秋同學們都活躍起來了漁撈科蓬着捉漁實習的同學照樣馳輪外出其餘的也就操艇的操艇製罐的製罐各近其性各行其事　　最吃苦的要算絞繩了每絞一條直徑三四寸粗的絏繩和繫錨我的粗繩因爲要使牠臨結的緣故非出一身大汗决不會有圓滿的結果這等工作在冬秀做還好在春秋兩秀那就苦了一看他們出汗的程度就知道比炎暑還要熱得十倍但是他們眞有百折不回的精神雖然手心中深深的紅了起泡了破了仍是努力不息地繼續看絞</p>
<p>製造罐頭食物也很有趣味的因爲我們有一個希望存在着做好了吃的問題在置配食料的時候工廠中熱烘烘的擠滿了一屋子的人衆聲沸沸再加以機器的聲浪更是糟雜不清所以每每稍爲粗魯的時常地就得誤投調味眞是件不容易的事</p>
<p>當漁撈實習的同學滿載歸來這時候同學們個個都將喜形於色因爲又可大嚼魚肉飽我們的口福塡我們的五臟了誠然對於我們是個欣然但是廚子們却整日地要忙得走頭無路不過這樣的事是極少的一學期中恐的也不能過到一遭</p>
<p>關於水産的生活大概是如此老實說過我們這等生産生活是生動的有意味的並且是有希望祗要政治上再不生變故漸漸驅入軌道那怕不逐强敵於海外振我國權於東亞</p>

<h3>Chiang's Trip to Wuhan Undecided</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Guling Telegraph. On the morning of the 16th, Chiang, along with Wu Zhihui, Shao Lizi, Zhou Fo Hai, and others, toured Bailudong (White Deer Grotto). They were guided by Liu Yigong, Director of the Lushan Administration. The itinerary included famous scenic spots such as Hanpokou, Bailongtan, Qixian Temple, Bailudong, Haihui Temple, Matouzhen, Wanyu Temple, Xiufeng Temple, Guizong Temple, and Lili. They returned to the Songshulin headquarters at noon on the 18th, but there is still no definite date for the trip to Wuhan. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Guling Telegraph. Wu Tingyang, former member of the Guizhou Provincial Committee, arrived on the 17th after being summoned by Chiang to discuss the aftermath in Guizhou Province. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Steps for Army Reorganization</h3>
<p>Intended to proceed in three steps.</p>
<p>Nanjing. The Central Government plans to reorganize the army in three steps. The first step is to reduce the number of old, weak, disabled, and sick soldiers, and to determine three types of organization (A, B, and C) based on the remaining strength. This is currently underway. The second step is to reduce the army to one hundred divisions. The officers and soldiers who are discharged will be accommodated in infantry, engineering, and artillery schools established by the Central Government. In addition, forest and reclamation areas will be designated in the Northwest, and the surplus officers and soldiers will be sent to reclaim land. The third step is to reduce the army to sixty divisions and fifteen independent brigades. The surplus officers and soldiers will be handled in the same way as in the second step. The national defense plan will be determined after the second step is implemented. After the establishment of the Army Reorganization Committee, Chiang will be the chairman, Zhang Xueliang will be the vice-chairman, and the number of committee members is expected to be nine to eleven, but this has not yet been fully decided. (19th)</p>
<p>External Affairs Department Plans</p>
<p>Urging Negotiations on Extraterritoriality</p>
<p>Nanjing. The issue of extraterritoriality needs to be resolved urgently. It is reported that a note has been drafted and will be sent to six countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil, urging them to negotiate a solution quickly. The note will be issued in about twenty-four days. The main content is that China announced the abolition of consular jurisdiction on New Year's Day this year, and a year has passed. Although there have been mutual consultations, there has been no result. It is hoped that the countries will send representatives to negotiate a solution with the Chinese government within a reasonable period to respect the spirit of China's judicial independence, and that the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty will be the basis for future new treaties.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>New Disputes Among Nations</h3>
<p>Although there is a movement for disarmament among nations, countries are still repairing and preparing their military forces. Therefore, many worried people consider a world war as a danger. However, in terms of international relations, although there are occasional signs of friction between France and Italy, it is not intense. Although there are disagreements between Germany and Poland, it does not reach the point of endangering diplomatic relations. In terms of international relations, this can be called an era with the fewest disputes. Even if there are one or two newly emerging disputes, they are very minor.</p>
<p>For example, recently, the Soviet Russian government closed the Vladivostok branch of the Korean Bank. The Japanese have protested to Russia, considering it an improper and unfriendly act, and requesting the Soviet Russian government to withdraw its decision. The Russian government's reply stated that the existence of the Vladivostok Korean Bank branch violates the Soviet Russian economic and financial policies, and its closure is justified. The extent to which the matter between the two countries will develop cannot be predicted at this time. Another example is the Turkish government's great indignation because the new Persian government released many chieftains of the Gothe tribe who had previously led their tribes to harass the Turkish border. It issued a notice stating that it has ordered the Army Department to order all border defense forces to take appropriate action and severely suppress any Gothe people who re-enter the border to harass, and to pursue them to Persia if necessary. Thus, the situation between Turkey and Persia, which had previously been at a certain stage, has now become tense again.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<p>The Reorganization and Dismissal Committee has been abolished</p>
<p>Nanjing. The National Army Reorganization and Dismissal Committee has been ordered to be abolished. Documents and files will be received by the General Headquarters Staff Office, and equipment will be transferred to the Military Council. The address will be received by the National Government Military Attache's Office as the location for the National Government Accounting Office. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wang Dongyuan's Division</p>
<p>Breaks Through the Bandit Nest in Pingjiang</p>
<p>Nanjing, Hunan Telegram. The bandit nest in Pingjiang was suddenly broken through by Wang Dongyuan's division. More than a thousand guns were seized along the way. The bandit forces relied on steep mountains, cliffs, and strong fortifications to stubbornly resist at every turn. The Wang Brigade of the division climbed the cliffs from two wings, surrounded and fiercely attacked, and used mortars to bombard the bandits. The bandits could not resist and fled towards Gaoqiao. Dozens of bandits were killed on the spot, and more than ten people, including Rong Jinquan, a member of the fake Soviet and Liu Jianbiao, chief of staff of the fake Seventh Division, were captured and executed on the spot.

All sectors are not allowed to close during the lunar New Year. In addition to sending a letter to the National Government to instruct compliance, it also instructs subordinates to comply accordingly. Important (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Xinjiang Representatives Invite Political Figures</p>
<p>To Visit the National Seal Jade Material</p>
<p>Zhang Fengjiu Reports on Jade Mining</p>
<p>Nanjing. Zhang Fengjiu, representative of the Xinjiang Provincial Government in Beijing, hosted a reception at Jinlingchun on the afternoon of the 19th for personnel from various central and government agencies and the press to visit the national seal jade material presented to the government. More than 80 people attended. Zhang Fengjiu reported that since the founding of the Republic of China in 1928, Hu Hanmin, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Gu Weijun, Minister of Civil Affairs of the National Government, believed that the establishment of the Republic of China required the casting of a national seal. The old seal transferred from Beiping was carved with strong feudal colors and was not applicable. Xinjiang produces good jade and hopes to find materials for casting the seal. After receiving the telegram, the Xinjiang Provincial Government selected materials in many ways and mined a piece of raw jade weighing about 20 catties in the Hetian County of Southern Xinjiang. At that time, due to the obstruction of traffic on the Sino-Eastern Railway, and the subsequent rebellion in the Northwest, it was very difficult to transport it, resulting in delays. Later, another piece of jade weighing 37 catties was mined in the Yurong Hash River in Hetian. The quality was even better. Immediately after the restoration of traffic, the first piece of raw jade was transported by camel. It will arrive soon. The latter piece of raw jade was taken by Commissioner Guang by the Siberian Railway to Beijing, along with two sheep-belly jade bracelets, a jade seal, and other products. It is an honor to have you visit today. At the same time, it should be stated that Xinjiang is located at the intersection of four directions and is a barrier for the country. However, due to the strong neighbors surrounding it, it has been frequently subjected to economic oppression from foreign countries and sabotage by domestic warlords in recent years. Without the political power of the central government, it is not enough to protect the new province. The new province has always absolutely supported the central government and hopes that the central government will not abandon its development due to its remote location in education, industry, and transportation. It is especially hoped that the government and industrialists will find ways to develop natural resources so that treasures will not be abandoned on the ground for a long time. Taking gold as an example, the output of the new province is not weak, and the price of each tael of silver is only about forty yuan. If it is mined properly and transportation is convenient, it will be enough to provide assistance for economic and financial problems. Jiao Yitang delivered a speech saying that the raw material of the current national seal was mined from Guangdong Province and is pure green, implying the idea of establishing the country through agriculture, which is the same as the world's opposition to communism's idea of using green to defeat red. The national seal of China has never been limited to one. The seal material brought this time is bright white and was mined from Hetian. Using it to cast the seal can not only represent the integrity of the government, but also represent the realization of national peace under the blue sky and white sun, and promote world peace. Moreover, the raw material is very large and can be used to cast both the party seal and the national seal. The remaining material can also be used to cast the head of state's seal. He also felt that jade is valuable, and the person who presents the jade has traveled thousands of miles to make the central government and the border area more intimate and seamless, which is especially commendable. From now on, the northwest and the southeast will contribute to each other in terms of materials and science, and it will all start here. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<p>French Steeg Cabinet Announces Policy Guidelines</p>
<p>No Change to Briand's Diplomatic Strategy</p>
<p>Financial and Political Affairs Handled Separately</p>
<p>Motion of No Confidence Rejected</p>
<p>With the Help of the Socialist Party</p>
<p>Narrowly Escaping Danger</p>
<p>Paris, National Society, 18th - Just as the new Steeg cabinet was about to attend Congress today, Minister of Pensions Dumil, Undersecretary of the Interior Coty, and Undersecretary of Agriculture Canhille, all from the right-wing faction, suddenly resigned. (Only three right-wing figures from the Taittinger and Marin factions now remain in the current cabinet). The remaining cabinet members immediately held an emergency meeting and decided to attend as planned. When the news of the three resignations reached Congress, the entire chamber was shocked and speculations arose. Later, Premier Steeg, accompanied by the new cabinet members, attended the meeting and read out the new government's declaration, which was concise in its wording. Its content adopted a compromise between the conflicting proposals of the left and right wings, and regarded the separation of finance and politics as the main guideline for future governance, in order to prevent a repeat of the corruption scandal recently discovered that endangered the national system, governmental dignity, and the reputation of members of parliament. As for foreign policy, the French consider peace to be the most important thing, but opinions still differ between countries. Only through joint action in economic and moral aspects, as well as adopting public judgment, guaranteeing security, and reducing armaments, can the causes of conflict be eliminated. Right-wing members of parliament listened silently to the Premier's declaration without making a sound. Members of the Radical Party and most of the Central Party responded with enthusiastic applause. Then, Franklin-Bouillon took the stage to express his opposition to the new cabinet, and the atmosphere changed drastically. Everyone thought that the cabinet's defeat was inevitable, and there was even a rumor that the Premier had decided that if he failed, he would ask the President to dissolve Congress tonight. Before long, the vote was announced, and to the surprise of the entire chamber, the government won by 291 votes to 284. The members of the Radical Party all cheered and celebrated. As for the new cabinet's fortunate victory, the stability and firmness of the declaration's wording was the main reason. Secondly, the talk of foreign policy and the dissolution of Congress also played a powerful role.</p>
<p>Paris, National Society, 19th - According to comments in the local newspapers, the Steeg cabinet was able to win a major victory in Congress today for two main reasons: First, the excessive activity of the opposition angered various small groups, causing them all to turn to the cabinet's side. Second, Premier Steeg's speech in Congress was calm and reasonable, and he strongly urged all parties not to be overly divided and to work together in harmony. Those who heard it were greatly moved, and he thus gained a lot of support. However, the government fears that it will not be immune from attacks for a while, and the political turmoil may not disappear from here. It is quite alarming.</p>

<p>Korean Bank Incident</p>
<p>Japan Lodges Protest with Russia</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Cables Hirota to Seriously Negotiate</p>
<p>Russian Embassy in Japan States Reasons for Closure</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 19th - It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Japanese Ambassador to Moscow Hirota last night, informing the Soviet Russian government that the Japanese government regards the closure of the Vladivostok branch of the Korean Bank as an improper and unfriendly act, as the bank should be operating in that port. Therefore, it specially requested the Soviet Russian government to withdraw its decision and consult with the Japanese authorities to peacefully resolve the entire case.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 19th - The Soviet Russian Embassy issued a statement regarding the closure of the Vladivostok branch of the Korean Bank, stating that this action was justified because the bank's existence violated Soviet Russian economic and financial policies. It also said that this is the only bank for the Russian middle class and that disputes arise from time to time. Moreover, the Soviet Russian government has never approved the bank to operate in the port, only with the permission of local Russian officials. For this reason, the central government has long intended to close the bank.</p>
<p>Harbin, Japan United Press, 18th - The Ussuri Railway Office's observation on the case of the Labor and Peasants' officials closing the Korean Bank in Vladivostok is as follows: The Labor and Peasants' government's approach to the Korean Bank this time is an urgent means to solve the Korean Bank problem quickly and does not intend to permanently block it.</p>
<p>Harbin, Japan United Press, 18th - From the afternoon of the 18th, Labor and Peasants' officials severely monitored the telephone calls of Japanese merchants between Vladivostok and Harbin. Whenever a telegram or telephone call mentioned the Korean Bank issue, the telephone bureau immediately cut off the conversation to prevent the news from leaking abroad. The extent to which the Labor and Peasants' officials' punishment of the Korean Bank will develop cannot be predicted, but all sectors here are observing it pessimistically. Some say that the Russian side will expel all Japanese shipowners in Vladivostok abroad and gradually extend the suppression of the Korean Bank issue to the suppression of all Japanese residents.</p>

<p>Japanese Interior Minister</p>
<p>Convenes Labor Legislation Roundtable Conference</p>
<p>Management Refuses Courteously</p>
<p>Tokyo, Electric Communications Agency, 19th - Interior Minister Adachi issued invitations yesterday, inviting both labor and management to hold a roundtable conference on the Labor Union Law, etc., on the 22nd. According to general observations, the Interior Minister's move is because the government has repeatedly stated that the bill must be submitted to the Diet. Now, in light of the situation in various aspects, the intention has been slightly moved. Representative roundtable meetings are convened for both labor and management to discuss with each other to see how the situation is, whether to maintain the original draft of the Social Bureau or delay the submission of the Labor Law, so that it falls into the stage of unfinished review. On the one hand, it avoids the government from eating its words, and on the other hand, it maintains the relationship between labor and management. It is a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Electric Communications Agency, 19th - As a result of the agreement reached by the capitalists today, it was decided to refuse to attend and issued the following statement: We are extremely respectful of Interior Minister Adachi's mediation, but because the representatives of the labor side have different ideas and opinions from us on the fundamentals of the country and industry, and cannot be regarded as truly representing labor talents and spirit, even if we attend the Labor Union Law roundtable conference, we may not be able to achieve the purpose of the meeting, so we cannot attend.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province Suppresses Bandits and Communists in Various Places</h3>
<p>Wang Yanzhen Leads Four Regiments to Northern Guangdong</p>
<p>Navy Sends Hai Rui and Other Ships to Qiong to Suppress and Deter</p>
<p>Guangzhou News: Communist bandits in the Gan border area have fled south and are now pressing on the Guangdong border. Huangkeng, Nanxiong, Nanxiong County has been closed since the 7th to defend it firmly. On the morning of the 8th, a small group of communist bandits, about 600-700 people, attempted to attack the north gate and were defeated by the Tan Regiment, which rushed to rescue them, and the militia. At present, Xiong City is still safe, but the government troops are still flowing from Shao. All areas starting with Xinghua and Renhua are covered with local military police. The Xinghua Jingwei Regiment and the militia, about 1,400 people, have set off to deploy defenses in Mashi to liaise with Nanxiong. Mashi is about 60 li from Nanxiong and can be used as the second line of defense. Therefore, Mashi has been digging trenches for days and has repeatedly requisitioned hundreds of local strong men to work day and night. As for Renhua, which is located west of Nanxiong, the terrain is also important. On the 12th, the county magistrate of the county, He Jiong Zhang, sent a telegram stating that the communist bandits in Nanxiong were gathered only a few miles away from the city, and the situation was critical. The county was adjacent to it, and the police force was weak and difficult to assist. Please send large troops to Renhua and Xinghua to block them to prevent the occurrence of chaos and stabilize the people's hearts. At present, the authorities have reportedly added Wu Jianxiong, Deng Hui, and other regiments from Shao to Nanxiong. Wang Dinghua's regiment in Xiaobeijiang suddenly received a telegram yesterday from Hu Jianxiu, the county magistrate of Yangshan, stating that the bandits in the county had dispersed. Wang's regiment stopped going to Yangshan and immediately transferred the departing troops back to Yingde. Recently, due to the importance of the defense above Shaoguan, the third battalion of the regiment was ordered to take a car from Yingde to Shaoguan on the 12th, led by the regiment's adjutant, and would go north from Shao to inspect the defenses. While troops were being deployed in the northern Guangdong area to defend against the Communists, news suddenly came from the southern route, Qiongzhou, that there was a communist riot. It was found that Qiongzhou Island is surrounded by water on all sides, and the ports and tributaries are numerous. The Communist Party took advantage of its transportation, so they gathered more and more people. The central part of Qiongzhou Island is full of mountains and forests, which are easy to hide. In the past, the Communist bandits had rioted once, and then the commander of the Fourth Fleet led the Marine Corps to quell it. The remaining bandits fled and hid in the mountains, and now they have reported another disturbance. The coastal area of Qiongzhou is vast, and only one regiment of Marines was left at the time to defend it. The strength was weak, so the communist bandits were able to carry out a second riot. According to a telegram from the Haikou Chamber of Commerce on the 10th, (Communist bandits are rampant. Urgent telegram bitterly states that the bandit forces are huge. Wu Xizhou, Zheng Jinkai, and Zhou Jingwu, the Tuan Dong of Yunlong Yanfeng Tashi on the east road, and Chen Xianping, the head of the Second Allied Regiment, were all killed, and all the equipment was confiscated. The Lingshan Dalin area was occupied. The west road is approaching Cangyi Toupu, only ten miles away from Haikou Qiongcheng, and is already besieging the regiment. It is in danger. I beg you to quickly send aircraft and warships to rescue and relieve the suffering. Haikou City Chamber of Commerce kowtows.) Recently, Zhao, an inspector sent by the Department of Civil Affairs to inspect the civil administration of the area, reported in a telegram on the 12th that the Zhangkou area, 30 li away from Qiongcheng, was attacked by a large group of communist bandits at 3:00 p.m. on the 6th. They burned the rafts and ferries, killed one worker, and Lianfang Director Wu Xizhou was tied up and killed, and three Tuan soldiers were killed and two were injured. In addition, the vicinity of Bailian, at the junction of Qiong (Qiongshan County) and Cheng (Chengmai County), has gathered thousands of bandits, and the people's hearts are fluctuating. Please send troops to the county to suppress them to relieve the suffering. Another telegram said that after Yushen Communist bandits burned Tan Kou's rafts and ferries, more than a thousand communist bandits attacked the Dalin Tashi Second Allied Defense Detachment in Qiong on the same night. The resistance lasted all night, and the bandits left on the morning of the 7th. The bridges on Qiongwen Road were all burned. Also, at the hour of Shen on the 7th, hundreds of communist bandits were found in the Longqiao of the Shizilu area of Qiong. The Qiongshan County magistrate cracked the Communist bandits' plan to attack the prefectural city with all their strength. The provincial authorities repeatedly received warnings, and the headquarters yesterday transferred a battalion of the Humen garrison. The provincial government transferred a regiment of security forces and handed them over to the 14th Fleet for use in warships to suppress the bandits. The fleet headquarters specially sent Chen Ding, the chief of staff of the department, to Qiong. Chen transferred to Hong Kong to Qiong with his staff officers Huang Xiong and adjutant Wang Chengfu on the 13th. The troops were divided into the Hai Rui and Fuan ships, which sailed directly from the province to Haikou and landed. (December 14)</p>
<h3>Military Movements in Fujian, Transfers and Defenses</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Asks Liu Shihuai to Move to the Border of Jiangxi</p>
<p>Two New Measures for Maintaining Security in the Province</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: It has been more than a day since various military units received orders to transfer defenses. Recently, in addition to Zhou Zhiqun's unit of Lu's troops having already left Yanping, its Second Brigade and Independent Regiment have also been successively departing. The movements of the remaining troops are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Liu Heding's 56th Division has been preparing to depart in recent days. On the 14th, Chen Peikun from the Provincial Committee, Jiang Pingfan, Director of the Finance Department He Gonggan, Transportation Commissioner Shen Qinmian, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Guo Yongrong, Director of the Water Police Bureau Shen Ke, and Director of the Provincial Government's Military Affairs Department Yang Tingying, and others held a public farewell banquet for Liu at the Wangzhuang Club. At 1:00 PM that day, Liu took a car out of the West Gate, accompanied by the entire special service company led by Brigade Commander Liu Shangzhi. It is planned to go to Yanping after arriving at Shuikou. The defense of Shuikou will be the responsibility of Gui Zhenyuan's brigade. The 334th Regiment of the 167th Brigade of the division, led by Li Huan, was originally stationed in the Tongfang area of ​​Xixiang. Recently, it has been ordered to return to the provincial capital and stationed in the brigade headquarters and the area around Shuhu. As for the entire Tang Regiment and Gui Brigade, they will be deployed to the front. However, in order to consolidate the provincial capital, Liu Heding specifically ordered Chief of Staff Wang Jicheng to stay in the province. Before Liu's division received the central government's telegram ordering them to move to Yanping, they were required to move to the border of Jiangxi to assist in suppressing the communist bandits. Considering the importance of defense, the provincial government telegraphed Chairman Yang yesterday, requesting him to telegraph Jiangxi and consult with Chief Supervisor Zhu Shaoliang to order the division to first take the route to Shunchang after arriving in Yanping, so as to go to Ninghua and Qingliu to prevent the communist bandits, and to temporarily postpone the move to Jiangxi. In addition, the newly formed Zhang Ziming unit is under the command of Liu's division. Its First Regiment, led by Chen Mingjiu, has already left for the province yesterday. It is estimated that more than 900 soldiers from Zhao Qi, Wang, and Yang Zhen's three battalions will be stationed in various places outside the West Gate, and will be able to depart in two or three days. The Second Regiment, estimated to have more than 700 soldiers, will also be able to arrive in the next day or two and will be dispatched together with the 168th Brigade.</p>
<p>Lin Bingzhou, Brigade Commander of the Marine Corps, came to the province a few days ago to request instructions on the transfer of defense to Jian'ou. Lin went to Gutian on the evening of the 15th and will lead his troops to Jian'ou. The Gutian County Government has already hired 1,000 laborers to be on standby. As for the defense of Putian and Xianyou, it is heard that it is planned to be under the command of the brigade's Deputy Brigade Commander Lin Xudong, and the Engineering Road Protection Team and Lin Jizeng's battalion will be under his command. Qian Yuguang, Brigade Commander of the First Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, returned to Gutian yesterday and was assigned the three counties of Chong'an, Pucheng, and Shaowu as his defense areas by the province. According to reports, the province received a telegram from Zheng Xiwu and other citizens of Chong'an County yesterday, stating that the communist bandits in the county are rampant and rely entirely on the garrison to defend it. Now that Lu's troops have been deployed to western Fujian, the area is vacant, and they requested to quickly stop the departure and add a large team.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>According to reports, the provincial government telegraphed yesterday to urge Qian's troops to depart for Chong'an, Pucheng, and Shaowu counties on a specific date to strengthen defenses.</p>
<p>The provincial government, in order to maintain security in the province in light of the departure of various military units, held a joint meeting of the Party, government, military, and police yesterday (the 15th). Those present were Zhan Diaoyuan, Lin Huangjuan, Wang Huai, Chen Lianfang, Kang Shaotong from the Provincial Steering Committee; Chen Peikun, Jiang Pingfan from the Provincial Committee; Yang Tingying, Director of the Provincial Government's Military Affairs Department; Wang Jicheng, Chief of Staff of the 56th Division; Li Dingzhang, Deputy Commander of Martial Law; Guo Yongyun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau; and Shen Ke, Director of the Water Police Bureau. The meeting started at 2:00 PM. First, Chen Peiluo reported, stating that at this time when the suppression of the communist bandits in western Fujian and the National New Year are approaching, the security of the provincial capital depends on the military and police to maintain it effectively. Yesterday (the 14th), Division Commander Liu Heding had already departed for Yanping, and Chen Jiliang was in command. Furthermore, he was summoned to Shanghai by Chairman Yang a few days ago. Although there are currently two regiments of soldiers from Liu's division, together with the Marine Corps and the water and land police, maintaining security in the provincial capital, the method of distribution needs to be properly planned to avoid omissions. Then, the attendees exchanged opinions and decided: (1) The provincial government will reissue the martial law decree and order the water and land military and police to intensify their work. The curfew hours and the inspection procedures in each area will be handled in accordance with the martial law regulations. (2) Patrols will be carried out by area. The south of the bridge will be the responsibility of the land team, the north of the bridge and the city will be the responsibility of Liu's division, and the Taijiang and Hongjiang areas will be patrolled by additional warships dispatched by the Water Police Bureau. The Municipal Public Security Bureau will handle special patrols, and all departments will work extra shifts. Secondly, appropriate discussions were held on punishing reactionaries and searching. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM. (December 16th)</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong's Troops Prepare for Downsizing</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Sun Lianzhong, Commander-in-Chief of the 26th Route Army, came to Jinan from Ji'ning on the 13th of this month to meet with Chairman Han Fuju and report on the relocation of his troops and the issue of joint defense. Sun will return to Ji'ning tomorrow (the 18th) after the negotiations are completed. I visited Sun this afternoon, and Sun said that his troops have completely arrived in Shandong and are stationed in Ji'ning, Dingtao, Heze, Juye, Cao County, and other places. However, the 1st Cavalry Division, led by Zhang Huatang, has not yet arrived in Huaiyang to suppress bandits. As a result of this meeting with Chairman Han, if it is necessary to suppress bandits in Yuncheng, Wenshang, and Jiaxiang counties, this unit will be deployed to defend them. No decision has been made yet. This unit has a total of twelve divisions: Gao Shuxun's 13th Division, Dong Zhentang's 14th Division, Ji Zhentong's 15th Division, Li Song's 4 infantry divisions, Zhang Huatang's 1st Cavalry Division, Zhu Changde's 2 cavalry divisions. In addition, there are Gao Zhihe's independent brigade, Zhao Shiqi's pistol regiment, and other units, totaling 47,000 men, 37,000 guns, more than 7,000 horses, and more than 50 mountain and field guns. When I was in the central government, I expressed that now that the war is over, there is no need for so many soldiers and requested downsizing. The central government approved downsizing by two Class A infantry divisions and one cavalry division. After I return to the defense, I will immediately engage in downsizing. One infantry division will be numbered the 25th Division. According to the central government's regulations for the commander-in-chief to concurrently serve as the division commander, I will serve as the division commander myself. One will be the 27th Division, with Gao Shuxun, the original commander of the 12th Division, as the division commander. The above numbers are determined by the central government, but because no official document has been received, it cannot be confirmed. Since the central government has not stipulated the cavalry division number, Zhang Huatang, the commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, will continue to serve as the division commander. All other original infantry and cavalry division commanders will be reassigned as brigade commanders. The cavalry division is temporarily set at more than 4,000 horses, with the remainder distributed among the infantry divisions. I am determined to conscientiously downsize according to the intention of the central government.</p>

At 2:50 PM, the bus arrived at Yangzhou Station. Because there were many local figures and military police welcoming him, he got out of the bus a few miles away from the station and walked to the station with County Magistrate Chen and others. Zhang took off his hat and shook hands with the welcomers one by one. Then he entered the city and went directly to the Superintendent's Office in Hejia Garden. Those who came to Yangzhou with Zhang included Chief of Staff Chen Zhuoru (Zi Puzhang), Director of the Management Office Tang Kenan (Zi Jianwu), Director of the Staff Office Yu Dianshu (Zi Junshi), Secretary-General Sun Zicheng, Chief Advisor Zhang Shusheng, and more than 80 family members and staff.

(Answer) I will stay in Yangzhou most of the time. When necessary, I may personally go to the front line to command. (Question) Can the Superintendent briefly explain the overall plan for preventing and suppressing bandits? (Answer) The entire province is divided into six districts. There are more bandits and communists in Jiangbei than in Jiangnan. It is planned to start with Jiangbei. The Jiangbei region is vast, so we should choose the areas with more bandit troubles to actively suppress them. (Question) The people are looking forward to the Superintendent as they look forward to the New Year. When will the bandit suppression work begin? (Answer) We have already started suppressing bandits in the Qinghuai area, and we plan to send troops to Gaobao soon. In addition, we still need to invite the various departments of the provincial government to hold a large-scale pacification conference and invite local figures to attend in order to carry out a comprehensive encirclement and suppression. (Question) How many troops are there for suppressing bandits? (Answer) Four divisions or more. (Question) What is the original strength of each county in Jiangbei? (Answer) We have started investigating and will be able to clarify it soon. The talk lasted about 20 minutes before I took my leave.</p>

After repeated joint trials by the Military Law Office of the Division and the County Rectification Committee, he admitted to joining the Communist Party and receiving orders from his superiors to hold demonstrations and riots on November 7, the anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Russian government. The division determined that Feng Su's riot was true, so it took him out of the Military Law Office, bound him, and escorted him to the open space on the north side of the road in Dongguan for execution by firing squad at noon today (the 18th). Feng was 19 years old, from Suxian County, and a first-year student in the senior normal department of Xuzhou Middle School. He lived in the Xu Zhongyi Courtyard in Beiguan and was very poor. Most of his expenses were subsidized by relatives and friends. His academic performance was very good. When he was taken out by the division headquarters, he was wearing a blue cotton-padded jacket and trousers made of foreign cloth, straight-soled cloth shoes, and his hair was combed. His hands were tied behind his back with hemp rope, and he wore a large coat. He looked calm and walked very quickly along the way, shouting slogans. When he arrived at the execution ground, he stretched out his neck to be killed. He was shot three times, with bullets passing through the back of his head and out of his right forehead, and blood splattering everywhere. After the execution, the division headquarters provided a coffin for burial. The 52nd Division headquarters announced Feng's crimes as follows: (According to the case, this division arrested Feng Su, a communist bandit who distributed reactionary leaflets and incited soldiers and civilians to riot on the side of the road outside Dongguan in this city on November 5. After strict interrogation, the criminal admitted to joining the Communist Party and that November 7 was the anniversary of the founding of the Soviet government. He was commissioned by the party's superior authorities to distribute leaflets to encourage soldiers and civilians to gather on Damalu to hold a large demonstration and riot to overthrow the Kuomintang, kill military and political officials, and support the Soviet government. The criminal Feng Su was extremely illegal and should be sentenced to death in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries to show an example and extend the law. In addition to taking the criminal Feng Su out to verify his identity, tying him up, and escorting him to the execution ground for execution by firing squad, this order is hereby issued to inform the public.)

Each competent authority will plan on its own and do whatever it can. As for the new budget, the urgency and importance will be reviewed to determine the reduction standard. (Question) How will agencies be merged when the new budget is implemented? (Answer) It is inconvenient to talk about it at the moment, and I don't want to answer verbally.

<h3>Supplementary Account of Yan Xishan's Secret Departure from Shanxi</h3>
<p>Escorted by Li Longting and Zhang Peimei</p>
<p>Through Datong and Fengtai to Tianjin</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Yan Xishan's departure from Taiyuan to Tianjin has been more than ten days. Because his actions were secret, outsiders have made many speculations about his journey, and newspapers in various places have also carried many reports that are not detailed. After investigating various related parties, the reporter has obtained detailed information about his journey. Although it is a thing of the past, it is still worth recording. The details of his journey are supplemented as follows:</p>
<p>After Yan returned to Hebian from Taiyuan on November 3, he immediately instructed Shang Zhen and Xu Yongchang to be responsible for handling military and political affairs in Shanxi, and actively prepared his luggage to prepare to go abroad. The speculation that Yan would go to Suiyuan was a feint to the east to ensure his safety along the way. On November 28, Zhang Peimei heard that Yan was going to Japan, so he went from Guoxian County to Hebian to pay his respects. That day, Yan also telegraphed Li Longting, the former section chief of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Li lives in Dongye), to come to his residence from Hebian. After Li arrived in Hebian, he followed Yan to Xihui Village on the morning of the 29th, and then to Jian'an Village, the home of Yan's father-in-law. Zhang Peimei and Wang Ziwei, the former secretary of the Pingjin Garrison Headquarters, followed. When they set off from Xihui, Zhang firmly requested to accompany him to Tianjin. Zhang said that if he did not repay the commander-in-chief at this time, when would he wait? Even if he went through fire and water, it would be his duty, let alone the unexpected events along the way. Although Zhang had been out of office for many years, his loyalty to the commander was evident from this. Compared with those who had been favored by Yan in the past, but now either avoided going to other provinces or remained silent and did not offer any advice, there was a world of difference. After the decision was made, Yan dressed as he had in the past, wearing a melon-skin satin hat, a gray wool cotton robe, a formal wool vest, spring silk cotton trousers, white city cloth socks, and all-win satin cotton shoes. He and Li Longting took a No. 6 car and set off at 11:00 AM from Jian'an, driving straight to Datong. Zhang Peimei and Wang Ziwei took a No. 9 car and followed 30 to 50 miles behind. When Yan and others set off, except for his father, wife, and son, who knew the details, everyone else was in the dark. When Yan's car passed through Yangmingbao, which belongs to Daixian County, a military policeman at the bus station paid close attention to the passengers in the car. Although the car did not stop, it sped past. The military policeman seemed to have realized that Yan was passing by. When Zhang Peimei and others arrived at Yangmingbao, the military policeman, who had served in Zhang's unit in the past, stepped forward and saluted, respectfully asking where the division commander was going. Zhang replied that there was a robbery case in Daiyue and he was going to investigate it. The military policeman looked around and, seeing no one, asked if the car that had passed was the commander-in-chief. Zhang said, "Don't talk nonsense, are you trying to spread rumors? Don't you want to move your head?" The military policeman replied, "Yes, yes." Zhang's car then drove on, following Yan's. When Yan and others arrived at Xuejiazhuang, which belongs to Huairen County, it was after 4:00 PM. Because it was still early and it was snowing heavily, they rested in the car at the station and each had a few cups of plain water. At 5:30 PM, they continued from Xuejiazhuang to Datong, arriving at about 7:00 PM. It was already dusk and the electric lights shone like daylight. It was originally planned to bypass the city and go straight to the station because the driver did not know the way. He stopped and asked the passers-by for details. At that time, a military policeman came up and asked who was in the car and where they were going. Li Longting replied on behalf of the driver, saying that the passenger in the car was Li Ziyi, an advisor to the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Li claimed to be Li Zhengnan, a secretary of the headquarters, accompanying the advisor to Tianjin on business, and inquired about where to bypass the city to go to the station. The military policeman, hearing that an advisor from the General Headquarters was visiting, saluted respectfully and informed him that the route had already been taken incorrectly. He could go through the city to reach the station. Li then thanked the military policeman and ordered the driver to drive towards the city. When the car arrived at the West Gate, the gate was closed. The driver honked the horn repeatedly, and the guards at the gate immediately opened the gate and stood respectfully by the side of the road, as if they knew that an important person was coming. However, neither party spoke to each other. Yan's car then drove straight north from the west, and at that time, there were still many pedestrians on the street, but no one paid attention to Yan's passage through this place. Yan's car left the North Gate and first arrived at the Yongmao Inn. The various units of Fu Zuoyi's newly arrived 10th Army had no space to stay. A soldier came out and said, "There is no place for you to stay in this store." After Yan experienced this setback, he turned to the Desheng Inn next door. The inn was originally stationed with a part of the Road Protection Command, but all the personnel were out on business that day, and the inn was deserted. According to the owner of the inn, the officers and soldiers would return after midnight, so Yan's temporary residence in the inn was not known to anyone. About two hours later, Zhang Peimei, carrying a roll of luggage, and Wang Ziwei got off at the West Bus Station and walked around the city to get there. After Zhang and Wang entered the store, they did not speak to Yan and Li at all, as if they did not know each other. However, the four of them rested in separate rooms. Before long, Li inquired about the PingSui train and asked the store owner to buy two first-class train tickets and pointed at Zhang and asked the store owner where those two were going and what class of tickets he planned to buy. The store owner said that they (referring to Zhang Peimei) were merchants and of course bought third-class tickets. Unexpectedly, the second train that night did not have first- or second-class cars. Yan and the other four people split up and bought four third-class train tickets. At 12:00 AM, the train finally started slowly, and they boarded the train together. The train was extremely crowded. Yan held a civilization stick and wore a woolen overcoat, sitting in the left corner with Li next to him. Zhang and Wang sat in front and behind. No one on the third-class train, carrying a world famous figure, Yan Xishan, was able to recognize him. After the train arrived at Zhangjiakou, two passengers also speaking the Shanxi language boarded the train and sat next to Yan and Li, looking at Yan with burning eyes, as if they had seen through Yan's tracks. Yan still remained calm and unhurried. He then got up and left the car. The two people asked Li where the old man was going. Li did not answer but pointed to his forehead and responded. The two people said, "Dizzy?" Li nodded in agreement. Yan stood outside the car for a long time and saw that his countrymen were determined not to recognize him, so he returned to his original seat. After passing through Juyongguan, Nankou, and other places, the train arrived directly at Xizhimen in Beiping. A military policeman boarded the train and asked Yan what he was doing. Yan replied that he was running a water conservancy company. The soldier then got off the train. After a short while, the train drove on. When it arrived at Fengtai, it was already 6:30 AM on the 30th. Yan and Li and Zhang and Wang parted ways. Yan and Li rested in the Liansheng Inn. When the train was about to depart for Tianjin at 9:00 AM, Yan and the others boarded the train. The journey was very peaceful. They arrived safely at Tianjin East Station at 11:40 PM on the 30th and took the Xilai Hotel's passenger car to the hotel in two groups. Yan stayed in room 61 of the hotel and immediately telegraphed Taiyuan, reporting that Yan had arrived safely in Tianjin. The telegram used a code, saying that Li Longting had recovered from his illness and not to worry. He stayed in the hotel for one night and moved to the private residence of Yan's relative, Bo Yizhong, on the 9th. The current rented residence is at No. 14 Fujian Street in the Japanese concession. Now that Zhang Peimei and Li Longting have achieved their purpose of sending Yan to Tianjin, they both returned to Taiyuan a few days ago. Also, Yan frequently spoke in the PingSui train, saying, "Look at how well the Jinghan train is run!" Yan said this because he felt the PingSui train stopped from time to time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Sabotage Monopoly of Northeasterners on Match Sales</h3>
<p>Say it is robbing the Japanese of their freedom to do business</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Northeastern authorities, in view of the fact that the business of the Northeastern match merchants has been repeatedly oppressed by foreign merchants and is on the verge of danger, and in order to maintain the match industry and promote domestic goods, have decided to establish a monopoly bureau to implement official-business cooperation. The Monopoly Regulations have been formulated by the Northeastern Political Affairs Committee and promulgated for implementation in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe provinces. In order to achieve the results as soon as possible, Liaoning Province has been actively preparing to organize the Monopoly Bureau, and the director of the bureau will be concurrently held by Zhang Zhenjing, Director of the Finance Department. The matters that the match merchants should prepare have also been transferred to the Match Federation for proper preparation. This monopoly system is inevitable. However, the Japanese have always had an aggressive attitude towards the industrial and commercial enterprises in the Northeast. The Japanese match business has a very wide sales market in the Northeast, and the annual leakage is alarming. If the monopoly is implemented, the Japanese merchants will not be able to make any profit. On the 12th, the Japanese Consul-General stationed in the country specifically notified the Liaoning Diplomatic Office, stating that Article 15 of the Sino-American Treaty of Wangxia stipulates that the people of related countries shall not impede their business by monopoly or other harmful restrictions. That clause should also equally apply to the Japanese. If the match monopoly is implemented in the Northeast and the Japanese are robbed of their freedom to do business or are restricted, it will inevitably cause disputes between our two countries. He asked to suspend the process in order to promote friendship. The Diplomatic Office has now forwarded it to the Provincial Government for review and instructions. (14th)</p>

A certain concubine is very beautiful and fierce, so Chen dotes on her extremely. The other day, the wife asked for two yuan from the shop to buy clothing materials for her son. The concubine, hearing this, became very jealous and also took five yuan, asking what it was for. The wife replied that if she took two yuan, the remaining five yuan could not be used.

<p>Further News on the Gunfight Between Police and Bandits in Mingwan, West Mountain; it was reported yesterday that a large group of lake bandits was discovered in Mingwan, West Mountain, under the jurisdiction of the county. The stationed water and land police teams rushed to suppress them, and the circumstances of the gunfight were reported yesterday. It is now known that the gunfight between the police and bandits the day before (the 18th) took place around 10 a.m. The fierce battle lasted for four hours. At that time, the bandits were surrounded on all sides by Water Police Teams 7 and 8 and the Hongping and Baosu patrol ships, leaving them no way to escape. They retreated to a small harbor between West Mountain and the Three Mountains. Seeing that the bandits were unable to resist, the police teams tightly surrounded their escape routes. The bandits dared not escape until late at night. At that time, the defense corps and police teams of both the East and West Mountains were on high alert, sending out patrols to block key points such as Changqi Port and Baihu Gate. Yesterday morning (the 19th) at around 5 a.m., seeing that the police defenses were slightly relaxed, the bandits fled to West Tai Lake, lingering at Mujiao Mountain. Wang Wusheng, captain of Team 8, seeing that the bandits had escaped, immediately joined the Hongping and Baosu ships and the ship of Team 7 and rushed to Mujiao Mountain, again surrounding the bandits. Li Jianxun, captain of Team 7, urgently telegraphed the Wuxian County Government, requesting that it immediately dispatch a team to assist in the joint suppression. He also asked County Magistrate Huang to telegraph Mao, the district chief of the Second District of Wuxi Water Public Security, to send a team from Xixi to Tai Lake to assist in the suppression. County Magistrate Huang, upon receiving the telegram, immediately ordered Du Hongji, the police captain, to order Cai Yu, the captain of the Third Company, to lead the team and go to the First and Third Squads stationed in Puzhuang and Xuzhuang to assist in the suppression. As a result of the gunfight the day before (the 18th), the bandits suffered more than ten deaths and injuries.</p>

Upon learning of this, Water Public Security Team 14 and the guerrilla team immediately rushed to suppress them, making contact with the bandits around 10:30 a.m. A fierce gunfight ensued. Captain Xu Boying then telegraphed Water Public Security District 3 for assistance. District Chief Shen, upon receiving the telegram, personally boarded the Zhizhong speedboat at noon and ordered the accompanying patrol ship to tow the district office patrol boat to Wu to assist in the suppression. As of 4 p.m., the gunfight had not yet stopped. It is reported that the bandits suffered many deaths and injuries.</p>

<p>Young Woman Beaten and Commits Suicide by Drowning; Dong Hanyuan, from Yancheng, who lives in the shed at No. 19 Maxiang on the east side of the railway outside the east gate of this county, has been working as a packer at the station. This spring, he hired a fellow villager, Song Jingkun’s wife, named Song Ada, who is twenty-three years old and has some beauty, to work as a female worker at the nearby Yifeng Silk Factory. However, after marriage, the couple often quarreled. At midnight the other day, for some unknown reason (one theory is jealousy over adultery), another quarrel broke out. Dong used a wooden stick to beat Ms. Jiang severely. Overwhelmed by the pain and anger, Ms. Dong stripped naked, ran out of the door, and jumped into the river, drowning instantly. At the time, Dong and others did not attempt to rescue her. Yesterday, Song’s body was discovered in the Maxiang Bridge canal. Dong Hanyuan, realizing the disaster he had caused, immediately fled far away. Afterwards, the Tuzheng reported to the county to conduct a legal examination. The examination determined that she had been injured before her death and had fallen into the river and died. The deceased’s father, Song Lianxiang, and others were questioned. Dong Zhou, Dong Hanyuan’s mother, was suspected of being an accessory and was ordered to be taken into custody along with the murder weapon, two wooden sticks, pending Dong Hanyuan’s arrest and trial.</p>
<p>Holding Township and District Shop Donation; Wuxi originally had four township police donations collected by the district to assist with police expenses. Recently, the county government plans to abolish the four township house donations and hold township and district shop donations. It also drafted twenty-three articles of collection regulations and submitted them to the 68th county political meeting for discussion and resolution. In addition to being approved by the Finance and Construction Departments for filing, it also ordered the Finance Bureau Committee to carefully compile and check in accordance with the regulations. Yesterday, it specifically ordered each district office and each public security branch to be responsible for assisting in the handling, and at the same time issued a notice to each township, district, shop, and landlord to abide by it and not to resist, hide, or leak. The shop donations are collected as follows: (1) 10% of the monthly rental price will be collected monthly. Those with a monthly rent of less than one yuan are exempt from donation. (2) Houses with existing shops that are pawned or owned will be assessed based on the size of neighboring shops and the quality of the building to calculate the rental price and collect the donation. (3) If a shop is occupied by family members, it will still be considered a commercial shop. (4) If the shop is rented, the shop donation will be borne equally by the tenant and the landlord.</p>
<p>Regulations on Year-End Account Settlement; the issue of year-end account settlement for the national calendar has been resolved by the State Council. However, there is still much doubt about the phrase “businesses without agreements may receive and pay at any time,” and many have inquired with the Chamber of Commerce about the truth. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce specifically sent a letter to each business stating: “The fourth State Council meeting of the National Government’s Executive Yuan on the 16th of this month resolved that the account settlement date is set for the end of the national calendar year, and repayment and collection of accounts will still be handled in accordance with the original agreement. Those without agreements may receive and pay at any time, etc. This case has been repeatedly communicated by the chambers of commerce of various counties through letters and telegrams, and this chamber has also submitted a telegram to the Ministry of the Council based on the opinions of the temporary meeting of business representatives, requesting that the method of collecting grain rice in Jiangsu Province be temporarily followed until February 16th of next year. Now, as a result of the resolution, although those without agreements may receive and pay at any time, they should still follow the method of collecting grain rice in Jiangsu Province at the latest and not exceed February 16th. The corresponding letter is hereby sent for your information.”</p>
<p>Appeal for Inspection and Registration of Rice and Grain; Qian Tianxiong, director of the Grain Inspection Office of Xiyi, sent an official letter to the Rice and Bean Industry Association yesterday, stating that from now on, all rice, wheat flour, and other food grains, regardless of import, export, transit, or quantity, must be registered daily by household at the Grain Inspection Office. Only after the inspection is accurate will they be allowed to be released. After receiving the letter, the Rice and Bean Industry Association convened an emergency meeting at 3 p.m. It was unanimously believed that Wuxi is a landlocked area with no need for inspection and registration, and that it is currently the winter season when farmers are harvesting rice and grain and exchanging rice for money to regulate people’s livelihoods. If inspection and registration are suddenly ordered, not only will misunderstandings occur, but also due to excessive caution, the export of agricultural products will be affected, which will be detrimental to the market. It was then decided to send a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce to report the situation to the county and forward it to the Provincial Government’s Department of Agriculture and Mining, requesting that the order be withdrawn.</p>

<p>A Series of Robberies Occur in the Fourth District; the homes of Zou Bocun, deputy of Sanli Township in the Fourth District of Wuyi, and Xu Mingjian, chief of the Twelfth Neighborhood, were suddenly attacked the night before by more than twenty bandits, each holding firearms, demanding silver dollars. Zou Bocun’s father was beaten by the bandits. Fortunately, a neighboring village sent a message to the nearby police station and militia, who came to surround and arrest the bandits. The bandits began to search for valuables and miscellaneous items and went north. Before leaving, they instructed the Zhou and Xu families to prepare 800 yuan in cash each within three days, and someone would come to collect the money, otherwise they would kill and set fire. The victims, in a panic, reported the incident to the county through the district office yesterday (the 18th), requesting an investigation.</p>

Unexpectedly, around 5 p.m. on the 17th, while passing near Qianqiao, he was suddenly stopped by a person, followed by five or six others. One of them held a pistol, aimed it at the officer, and pretended to shoot, saying that he was definitely an official detective and had to be taken to Getang Bridge. They seized his wallet, badge, symbol, summons, etc., and forced him to follow them. After repeated pleas, they finally agreed to release him. The officer arrived at the court on the 18th and reported the incident to Prosecutor Yang. It is reported that these bandits were outposts sent by the bandits.</p>

<p>Huangtiangang Dredging Committee; Huangtiangang, outside the north gate, has not been dredged for many years, which affects water conservancy throughout the province. For the past two years, the county government and the Construction Bureau have convened meetings of various agencies to dredge it, but it has been difficult to achieve. The county political meeting previously resolved to form a Natural Committee, which is divided into three sections: engineering, economics, and affairs. At the committee meeting on the 17th, it was resolved that the budget would be re-examined and compiled by the Construction Bureau. The county government and the county party headquarters will submit a request to the Construction Department to allocate 30,000 yuan in construction bonds for the Huangtiangang project and raise funds freely in the county as a subsidy for the provincial dredging expenses. In addition, the 20,000 yuan of water conservancy fees already collected in this county and the 6,000 yuan of welfare company funds will be investigated and collected by the county government. The economic section will detail the methods for collecting coal-related donations, ship donations, and fish donations, which will be discussed at the next meeting.</p>
<p>Cui Siping Severely Reprimands the Director of the Beiwai Public Security Branch; Cui Siping was secretly reported to County Magistrate Li for allegedly accepting bribes and releasing soil merchant Zheng Fuxiang, etc. County Magistrate Li went to investigate and found that Zheng was still in the custody of the Public Security Bureau. Director Cui declared that he was not a soil merchant because his couple’s behavior was improper. County Magistrate Li considered that since there was no evidence that Zheng was a soil merchant, he should not be fined so much. Furthermore, the Zheng couple had not committed any misconduct. The Public Security Bureau severely reprimanded the director for improper handling, to serve as a warning for the future.</p>
<p>Investigation of the Miao Wencai Suicide Case Concluded; Miao Wencai, a graduate of the police academy, committed suicide just one day after taking office as the director of the Fifth Public Security Branch.

On the afternoon of the 18th, the investigating judge Yang summoned his brother, Yougang, and the clerk of the Fifth Branch, Fu Xueniang, for questioning. Miao Yougang stated that his younger brother, Wencai, was oppressed by Fu Xueniang and had a suicide note as proof because he had been persuaded by Zhou Guotang and Yu Nian not to be so harsh. Therefore, Fu Nian was prosecuted under Article 282 of the Criminal Law. Fu Nian stated that he was just a clerk and had no way to oppress the director. Furthermore, on the day Wencai committed suicide, he had gone to visit a friend at 1:00 p.m. and only returned to the bureau around 4:00 p.m. After the questioning, the court ordered the investigation to be concluded and awaited judgment.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Commerce Expresses Concerns About the Business Tax Again; the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday regarding the special handling of the business tax in Jiangsu Province. The telegram stated that since the central government has determined the date for abolishing the Likin tax, the government has changed the original plan for preparing for the business tax, postponed the original business registration fee, and convened a business tax preparatory committee to discuss it in detail, so that it can be implemented after the Likin tax is abolished, which shows that the government is adapting to the times and acting cautiously. Now, a telegram has been received from Finance Minister Song stating that the Likin tax and similar Likin taxes will be abolished on January 1, 1931. After the Likin tax is abolished, the business tax will be the source of revenue to compensate the provincial treasury. No matter how difficult it is for businesses and people, they should abide by it without hindrance. However, since the Ministry of Finance has stipulated the outline of the business tax measures and the date for abolishing the Likin tax has been determined, the previous Jiangsu Province’s plan to compensate for the abolishment of the Likin tax is a thing of the past and is no longer an issue. In the future, when Jiangsu Province holds the business tax, all tax rates and all matters should be handled in accordance with the outline of the business tax measures of the Ministry of Finance. Otherwise, both the Ministry’s orders and business conditions will be hindered, which is not the intention of the central government’s firm determination to abolish the Likin tax. Therefore, we dare to present it in the hope of being observed.</p>
<p>The Provincial Capital Actively Investigates Household Registration; the Jiangsu Department of Civil Affairs believes that this province-wide household registration investigation is extremely important, and the household registration in the provincial capital is complex, so it should be carefully investigated to ensure accuracy. Therefore, it specifically ordered the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau to consult with the Zhenjiang County Government to jointly handle it and ensure that it is completed within the time limit. Director Chen and County Magistrate Zhang, after receiving the order, consulted on the method and decided that the household registration within the provincial capital area would be the responsibility of the respective town and deputy chiefs, and the household registration police would assist in the verification to ensure accuracy and detail. It has now been actively implemented and the investigation began yesterday. Households without a legitimate occupation are required to have the landlord guarantee and report the investigation.</p>
<p>The May 3rd Library is Actively Proceeding; the Zhenjiang May 3rd Library will soon begin construction. All specific plans have been prepared, and the architectural drawings have been determined. The construction cost is set at 16,000 yuan, and a letter has been sent to the County Executive Committee requesting the transfer of 5,000 yuan from the National Salvation Fund, and the Education Bureau will be consulted for further assistance. A separate committee will be formed to handle the collection of books, with Ye Zuoren, Li Yanhu, Liu Qingxuan, Wu Ti, Xian Yanggong, Zhu Jinru, and Dong Shu as members. Liu Qingxuan will be responsible for the internal equipment.</p>
<p>The Entire City’s Street Vendors Go on Strike; the streets from Yinshanmen to Ximen Bridge in Zhenjiang are lined with shops and are the commercial center of the city. The narrow streets, coupled with the street vendors setting up stalls along the road, almost completely occupy the streets, making it extremely crowded for pedestrians. The Construction Engineering Office has long planned to rectify this, but there is no suitable place for the street vendors to relocate to. Therefore, it has successively built vegetable markets in Genglou Lane and at the foot of Baogai Mountain, which have been completed. It then consulted the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau and ordered all street vendors to move into the vegetable markets and not to sell on the streets. The street vendors believe that although the vegetable markets have been built, the area is too small to be used, and they requested that a solution be found. The Public Security Bureau then allowed them to sell in the inner streets, but the inner street shops objected. The street vendors had no way to advance or retreat and had no choice but to temporarily suspend business and wait for a solution. At the same time, they reported the situation to the authorities to maintain their livelihoods and requested that a larger vegetable market be built in a suitable location. If funds are limited, they are willing to contribute proportionally.</p>

<p>The Truth About the Expenditure of Education Fees; Yangzhou’s education fees are difficult to manage. During this busy season of reed harvesting, it still feels strained. However, the financial collection has always been kept secret, and outsiders have no way of knowing the truth. It is now known that when the Finance Department Committee member, Cha Tongmei, recently went to the county to investigate, he also paid attention to the collection and expenditure of education fees. According to the financial department’s report, as of the end of November, the amount collected during these two busy seasons was 7,465 taels, and the education fees to be paid amounted to more than 9,000 yuan. However, the Education Bureau actually received only 7,000 taels. It is said that after the Cai Committee member inquired, Qian Suizeng, the head of the county’s financial department, promised to allocate it to the Education Bureau within two weeks.</p>
<p>Director Han Raises Money to Take a Concubine; Director Han (from Rugao) of a certain agency in Yangzhou is lonely in the guest house. Recently, he asked a trusted friend in Yangzhou to find a young girl, but the other party’s asking price was 300 yuan before a deal could be made. Han is naturally stingy and came up with the idea of asking local gentry Wang and Gu to borrow money under false pretenses, so he was able to arrive in Yangzhou the other night. It is said that he is now hiding his lover in Wang’s residence in Yuhang Lane, which is ridiculed as a strange tale of raising money to take a concubine.</p>

<p>Zhang Daofan Scheduled to Take Over</p>
<p>Chen Bulei, Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee and concurrently Director of the Education Department, has been appointed Vice Minister of Education.

(2) The new Director, Mr. Zhang Daofan, possesses outstanding knowledge and is highly skilled in handling affairs. He is a loyal and hardworking comrade in our party and will be a blessing to education in this province. (3) He is reluctant to part with his colleagues after working together for so long. However, since we serve the public, we should learn from each other in our work. Although we may be separated, it will be as if we are still working in the same room. (4) He hopes that everyone will continue their past progress and assist Director Zhang in completing the improvement of education. (5) In the future, when he has time to return to Zhejiang, he hopes to meet everyone again on the shores of West Lake and hear about their hard work. (6) Before Director Zhang arrives in Hangzhou to take over, he requests that Secretary Lin carefully handle all matters in the department. After speaking, he took a group photo with all the staff as a memento. He left for Beijing by train last night (the 19th) to prepare for his new post and will take office on Monday next week.</p>

<h3>All Blacks Basketball Team</h3>
<p>Soundly Defeats Nagasaki Medical University</p>
<p>Result: 56 to 36</p>
<p>Medical University to Face Huadong at 7 PM Tonight</p>
<p>The match between Medical University and Zhonggong has been rescheduled to the 26th</p>
<p>The Nagasaki Medical University basketball team initially defeated the mediocre Tongwen College 56-31. Last night at 7 PM, they played against the All Blacks at the Chinese basketball hall, suffering a crushing defeat of 35-56. It was observed that the All Blacks team, which is also the team ranked third in Group A of the Xiqing Basketball Association, displayed remarkable skill in their victory over the Medical University last night. This was not due to the strength of the All Blacks, but rather the weakness of the Medical University. The Xiqing Pirates team originally planned to compete with the Medical University, but having learned of the Medical University's weakness, they are unwilling to reveal their skills.</p>
<p>Throughout last night's match, the Medical University was at a disadvantage. The first half ended with a score of 26-14 in favor of the All Blacks. In the second half, the Medical University's counterattack was ineffective, and the All Blacks won 56-35. Tonight at 7 PM, the Medical University will play against the Huadong team at the same location, refereed by Shao Ji. Considering their respective strengths, the Medical University will likely suffer another crushing defeat. The match against Zhonggong has been rescheduled to 7 PM on the 26th.</p>

<p>Salt Affairs Loans Principal and Interest Repaid on Schedule</p>
<p>The 36th installment of the Crisp Loan interest coupon, amounting to £114,890, and the drawn bonds of the British-French Loan, amounting to £253,318, both due this month, total £368,208. This is equivalent to approximately 6.85 million silver dollars. Finance Minister Song has instructed the Salt Affairs Audit Office to pay the amount. Since Finance Minister Song announced the plan to reorganize salt affairs loans in September of last year, five payments have been made on the salt tax-guaranteed loans, totaling £1,202,948, equivalent to approximately 18.22 million national currency dollars. All payments were prepared and paid by the Audit Office in accordance with Finance Minister Song's reorganization plan, without any delays. Taking the Crisp bonds as an example, the market price, which had fallen to 28, has now risen to 53. This is of no small benefit to maintaining national credit and increasing salt tax revenue.</p>
<h3>Telegram Requesting Return of Vehicles</h3>
<p>Sun Ke Telegrams Military Commanders</p>
<p>The case of railway vehicles seized by various military units, which the General Headquarters has repeatedly ordered to be returned, has been previously reported. It is now reported that the Ministry of Railways has received reports from various railway bureaus that the number of vehicles returned by the military is very small. Yesterday, Minister Sun telegraphed the various military commanders again, earnestly appealing to them to consider the importance of transportation and promptly return the seized vehicles in full. The text of the telegram is recorded below: "It has been repeatedly ordered by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and the Executive Yuan that the locomotives and vehicles seized by your army and its subordinate divisions and brigades be returned to their original routes. However, according to reports from various railway bureaus, the number of locomotives and vehicles recovered in recent days is very small. Now, the Commander-in-Chief has again dispatched personnel to jointly negotiate with the personnel dispatched by this Ministry on various routes, urging the various military units to return the seized locomotives and vehicles in full as scheduled. This matter is of great importance to transportation. Please earnestly consider this and promptly instruct your subordinate military units to return the seized vehicles in full as scheduled. After the vehicles have been returned in full, if there are any military transportation matters, please notify the railway bureau to prepare vehicles, and there will be no delays. We hope that you will approve this and act accordingly. I am deeply grateful. I respectfully submit this telegram and respectfully request a reply. Sincerely, Sun Ke."</p>

<h3>Naval Reorganization Office Ends at Year's End</h3>
<p>Results of Yesterday's Meeting</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the Naval Reorganization Office has been established since June of the 18th year of the Republic, and now it has been half a year. During this period, because there is a demand for naval talent today, there is no so-called reorganization or removal. Now, the Central Government has ordered all national military reorganization agencies to be abolished, and the Naval Reorganization Office has also received a clear order to complete its work. Yesterday, the office held a final meeting with a majority of its committee members in Shanghai. The meeting was held at 2 PM at the Gaichangmiao Office of the Reorganization Office. The committee members who attended were Yang Shuzhuang, Chen Shaokuan, Zhang Qun (represented), Liu Chuanshou, and Chen Jiliang (represented). Those present were the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, Ren Guangyu, the Director of the Business Office, Zhou Zhaorui, and others, totaling ten people. Because the quorum was met, the discussion began. It was resolved that the Naval Reorganization Office would be completely closed by the end of this year and reported to the Central Government. Later, at 5 PM, the reporter met with Committee Members Yang and Chen and obtained brief conversations as follows:</p>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang talked about the reporter meeting with Mr. Yang and immediately asked about the disposal of the office after its closure and the affairs of Fujian Province. In response, the answer was that the disposal after the office's closure still needs to be instructed by the Central Government. Today, only the closure was resolved. As for the affairs of Fujian Province, everything is proceeding as usual. The committee members who are staying in Shanghai will also have to return soon. However, his (Yang said himself) itinerary has not yet been determined. When asked if Zhu Shaoliang would be fully responsible for military affairs after entering Fujian, he replied that he did not know, but it is certain that the Sixth Route Army has already been transferred from Jiangxi to Fujian. Chen Shaokuan talked about the reporter then interviewing Mr. Chen. Chen said that the reorganization office is scheduled to close, and the disposal of personnel after that, whether they will be given appropriate positions, transferred to the Ministry, or sent elsewhere, is still under consideration. As for the subsequent name, whether the old General Headquarters name will still be used or whether the Naval Shanghai Office will have to be reorganized, it will also need to be instructed by the Central Government before proceeding.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Household Registration Completed by County Magistrate on Time</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government previously instructed each district to follow provincial orders and uniformly begin the household registration survey on the first of this month. It is now learned that County Magistrate Yan again sent a telegram to each district chief yesterday, stating: "I have received a telegram from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, stating that the start date for the household registration survey in this province has long passed, and the deadline is approaching. The degree to which each county has progressed is of great concern. In addition to separate instructions, I am urgently telegraphing you, the County Magistrate, to report the progress of the work by the date of receipt of this document, without delay or fault." Upon receipt of this, this county has followed the Department's orders and forwarded instructions to each district to begin the survey and complete it on time. In addition to reporting and distributing separately due to the previous circumstances, I am now telegraphing each district chief to follow instructions, expedite the survey, and complete it by the end of this month, submitting a list to the county for compilation and forwarding. First, submit a report on the progress of the work by a set date for verification, without delay. Sincerely, County Magistrate Yan Hao (seal)."</p>
<h3>Pawnshop Industry Labor Dispute Yesterday's News</h3>
<p>Workers Arrested One After Another</p>
<p>Union Petitions for Protection</p>
<p>Due to the pawnshop industry workers' demand for changes in treatment conditions being rejected by the employers, a general strike was implemented the day before yesterday. That evening, one worker was arrested and detained by the Public Concession Police. After negotiations by the strike committee, he was released that night. Yesterday afternoon, four workers were arrested by the Harbin Police. The strike committee immediately held a general meeting to discuss rescue measures and requested the City Party Headquarters to forward a letter to the court for their immediate release. All city labor unions and trade unions have begun organizing a support association for the pawnshop workers' strike. The situation of this labor dispute has become increasingly widespread. The details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Incident the Night Before Last</p>
<p>At 9 PM the night before last, after the striking workers finished their meeting at the Lao Bei Men workers' union, they left the meeting one after another. More than ten pawnshop workers from the Hongkou area of the Eastern District also carried strike leaflets and declarations and walked from Lao Bei Men towards Avenue Edward VII to take a public bus to Hongkou. When they reached the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Henan Road, one Chinese and one Western detective from the Sima Road Police Station stood there searching pedestrians. Seeing more than twenty workers coming towards them, the Chinese detective stepped forward to search and asked what the bundles in their hands were. Worker Tang replied that they were strike leaflets. The Western detective paid close attention and ordered the workers to go to the Sima Road Police Station. The remaining workers rushed back to the workers' union to report that member Tang had been arrested. The strike committee immediately sent representatives Cheng Xingzhu, Cheng Zijun, and Deng Dunli to the police station for negotiations. The police department ordered the political department to translate Tang's leaflets into English. Because the leaflets did not contain slogans like "Down with Imperialism," Tang was released at 11:30 PM, regaining his freedom.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Situation</p>
<p>At 8 AM yesterday, about 100 pawnshops in the city were not open, and only a few were operating as usual. The investigation team set off before 8 AM to conduct investigations in various districts and provide encouragement. By the afternoon, the investigators from each district returned to report: (1) Among the 32 pawnshops in the Eastern District, only He Kang on Dong Jiaxing Road was operating as usual; the rest were closed. (2) Among the 18 pawnshops in the Southern District, only An Ding near Da Nan Men was open; the rest were also closed. After the investigation team's persuasion, An Ding also closed at around 11 AM. (3) Among the 17 pawnshops in the Western District, three were open: Shun He on Ba Xian Qiao, Shun Kang on Avenue Haig, and Shun Tai on Fangbang Bridge. The rest were closed. After persuasion, the above three also closed at 9:30 AM. (4) The 13 pawnshops in the Northern District were completely on strike. (5) Among the 28 pawnshops in the Central District, two were open: Bao Xi on Weihaiwei Road and Tong Yi on Shantou Road. After persuasion from a special team at 8:30 AM, they closed.</p>
<p>Petition for Mediation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the pawnshop workers' union submitted a document to the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting immediate mediation. The document stated: "Regarding the fact that the union believes that the employers have consistently lacked sincerity in accepting the party and government organs' explicit orders to negotiate a settlement and do not recognize the workers' organized group, which has provoked public anger, resulting in a strike yesterday (the 18th). The union will absolutely order all members to strictly maintain order and proceed peacefully during this strike period. We earnestly hope that your bureaus will immediately and strictly order the employers and convene both parties for mediation as soon as possible. The members of this union are now determined to go to the end, and will not resume work until the conditions are resolved. Respectfully presented with urgency, awaiting your decision. Sincerely, the Shanghai Pawnshop Workers' Union, addressed to the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau."</p>
<p>Workers Arrested</p>
<p>The strike investigation team went to He Kang Pawnshop on Dong Jiaxing Road in the Eastern District because it was operating as usual to persuade them to close, but they did not accept the advice. At 4 PM yesterday, a special team of nine people was sent to give serious advice. First, one team member walked into the pawnshop to persuade them with kind words. Soon after, one patrol officer from the Harbin Police followed and arrested the team member. Shortly after, three more team members entered He Kang Pawnshop and were persuading them when the patrol officer arrived again and arrested the three team members together and took them back to the police station. The remaining five workers returned to report to the strike committee to find a way to rescue them.</p>
<p>General Meeting of Members</p>
<p>After receiving the news of the workers' arrest, the strike committee immediately convened a general meeting of members. More than 300 members attended. Wang Ganchen was elected as chairman to preside over the meeting. Representatives from various districts reported on the strike situation on that day, and representatives of condolences gave speeches one after another. Then, the rescue of the arrested workers was discussed, and it was resolved: (1) To appoint representatives Li Fulin, Cheng Zijun, and Wang Ganchen (Deng Dunli as a substitute) to negotiate with Chen Qizi, the owner of He Kang Pawnshop, with a letter, demanding that he be responsible for bailing out the four arrested workers at any time, otherwise, serious measures would be taken. (2) To petition the City Party Headquarters to send a letter to the Special District Court to release the arrested workers. (3) To petition the City Party Headquarters to forward a letter to the employers' trade association, requiring them to be responsible for not undermining the strike, arresting workers, or harming the interests of the workers in the future. (4) To appoint representatives Hu Jinzhang and Hong Xiamin to visit the four arrested workers at the Harbin Police Station to express their condolences.</p>
<p>Condolences from All Parties</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, representatives from the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, Zhao Zhenhui and Fang Qingjian; representatives from the British American Tobacco Workers' Union, Chen Peide; representatives from the Huacheng Tobacco Factory Workers' Union, Zhou Xuexiang; representatives from the Commercial Press Publishing House Workers' Union, Wang Yongchang; and representatives from the Chinese and Foreign Textile Workers' Union, Yuan Zhaoxin, as well as representatives from the hemp bag industry union, visited the pawnshop workers' union to express their condolences. Representatives from the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, Zhao Zhenhui and Fang Qingjian, often provided guidance to the Commercial Press Publishing House Workers' Union and also sent letters of condolences.</p>
<p>Labor Support</p>
<p>The city's Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, the Commercial Press Union, the Commercial Press Publishing House Workers' Union, the British American Tobacco Factory Workers' Union, the Postal Workers' Union, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Fifth Wharf Workers' Union, the Chinese Electricity Workers' Union, the French Electricity and Water Workers' Union, the Calligraphy and Painting Paper Fan Industry Workers' Union, the Chinese and Foreign Textile Workers' Union, the Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union, the Soy Sauce Industry Workers' Union, the Journalism Industry Workers' Union, and the Southern Goods Industry Workers' Union, out of sympathy for the pawnshop workers' strike, yesterday initiated the convocation of various labor unions and trade unions to organize a support association for the pawnshop workers' strike to provide strong assistance.</p>
<p>Employers' Meeting</p>
<p>The members of the pawnshop industry trade association, fearing that the prolonged strike would lead to a widespread disturbance, decided yesterday to convene a general meeting of all new and old members of the industry at the Li Feng Small Gathering Hall on Bei Hai Road at 1 PM today to discuss all solutions to the labor dispute. The Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Pan Gongzhan, also sent Zhu Guilin from the Third Section to the workers' union yesterday afternoon to investigate the 17 proposed modifications to the conditions proposed by the labor side for reference in mediation on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Liquor Store Workers' Slowdown Yesterday</h3>
<p>Unable to Endure the Oppression of the Second District Tax Collection Office</p>
<p>The Trade Association Held a Meeting Yesterday to Counter</p>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, a portion of the coolie workers in the liquor stores, due to the addition of hour and minute notations on the liquor delivery permits, found it extremely difficult. All coolies and clerks in the city gathered at the union yesterday to await a negotiated resolution. The important news is selected and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Slowdown</p>
<p>The current tobacco and alcohol monopoly regulations are already strict. Li Guangzhen, the director of the Second District Baijiu Tax Collection Office, who was qualified to contract as a merchant, suddenly did not obtain approval from the Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau to be submitted to the Provincial Bureau. On the 15th of this month, he notified all liquor stores in the city that all liquor leaving the stores must have a time stamp affixed, and each store was issued a number of time stamps, requiring each store to fill in the hour and minute. If this time stamp was missing, it would be considered illegal, and the inspectors of the office could detain and severely fine the store. After hearing this news, the clerks in each store, feeling that the implementation of the new regulations would inevitably lead to excessive fines for delivering liquor, were indignant and automatically gathered at the union on the 17th to implement a full slowdown.</p>
<p>Convening a Meeting</p>
<p>After all the clerks in the industry slowed down, they gathered at the union, requesting the standing committee to convene a meeting to discuss solutions. The union also regarded this new regulation as an illegal and oppressive measure. However, considering that the matter concerned both employers and employees indirectly, they immediately inquired with the trade association for their opinion. It was then decided to cooperate in the struggle. The union then convened a temporary emergency meeting at 1 PM on the 18th. In addition to all the clerks, there were also over 100 workers present. Hu Dun was elected as chairman and Gu Jiren as the recorder. After the ceremony, the chairman first reported on the illegal behavior of the tax collection office and the difficulties in delivering liquor. Then, they discussed: (1) No one is allowed to compromise with the tax collection office. If anyone compromises, they will be dealt with using appropriate means. (2) If anyone disrupts the negotiation process, they will also be dealt with using appropriate means. (3) Vigorously assist the trade association and vow to fight to the death. If there is no satisfactory resolution, they will not resume work. (4) All workers must strictly maintain order and not act rashly. (5) The foremen of each store must sign a guarantee that they will not disrupt the slowdown. (6) If there is no solution, all workers will jointly join the effort and request the employers to close their businesses.</p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<p>The union's objectives are as follows: (1) Immediately abolish the harsh regulations. (2) Fines received must be given with five-part receipt, and receipts must also be issued for all previous fines. (3) The time for issuing permits must be extended. If the stores are far away and cannot deliver them in time, they must be allowed to collect them the night before.

<h3>British Airplane Flies to Beijing This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Has Obtained Permission from the Aviation Administration</p>
<p>Office Reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yesterday</p>
<p>For the sake of promoting sales, the British company Far East Aviation Company specially dispatched aviator Harvey to fly an Avro Avian biplane from Hong Kong on the 11th of this month, passing through Xiamen and Fuzhou to Shanghai, landing at the Hongqiao Airport. A public performance was given on the 14th. It was originally scheduled to fly to Nanjing immediately, but it was delayed because it did not obtain permission from the Chinese Aviation Administration. In recent days, the British Consul General has repeatedly sent letters to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs office, and the British Consul in Beijing has directly consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request that the Aviation Administration be asked to approve the passage. Yesterday afternoon, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs office received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating: "Your telegram is noted. The British airplane is coming to Beijing and has been approved by the Aviation Administration. A telegram has been sent to the Shanghai Aircraft Factory Director to release the airplane. Please contact and telegraph the time of arrival in Beijing to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Aviation Administration appreciates your cooperation." After receiving the telegram, the office sent letters to Aircraft Factory Director Shen Dexie and the Municipal Government, requesting that it be released. It is heard that the British airplane is scheduled to fly to Beijing at 12 PM today. The office telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, but if the weather is not good at that time, the departure will be postponed.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Begin Early New Year Holiday</h3>
<p>Stopping Work Successively From the 16th</p>
<p>The silk factory industry in this port, because the foreign silk market collapsed, lost all its capital and was unable to support itself, so it completely stopped operations. After deliberation by the industry, representatives were elected to petition in Beijing, requesting the government to issue 10 million yuan in public bonds for the silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai to provide relief. It has been approved by the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association earnestly persuaded various silk factories to resume work for the sake of the workers' livelihoods. For a time, more than 30 factories (excluding Shuang Gong Silk Factory)勉力 opened for business. However, there was still no turnaround in the European and American silk sales. For a month, silk telegrams have not been turning around. No one is asking about overseas raw silk. The United States, which has the largest raw silk sales volume, is also experiencing economic instability, and the number of bank failures in various cities is increasing daily. The number of silk factories that have stopped work is increasing, and Chinese silk is becoming increasingly fatigued. The Shanghai silk market is stagnant, and the stock of silk is thick. In the blink of an eye, the end of the year is approaching, and there is no capital to turn around. It was publicly decided to stop the New Year holiday early to save expenses. More than a dozen of the thirty-odd silk factories that had started work in Shanghai have successively stopped work since the 16th. All financial circles are urgently demanding repayment of silk cocoon mortgages, and silk merchants cannot redeem them, and they are all frowning. There is silk but nowhere to mortgage it. If the government's public bonds to relieve the silk factory industry are not issued immediately, then when the New Year is approaching, there will undoubtedly be a large number of Shanghai silk factories declaring bankruptcy.</p>

<h3>Coal Merchants Request Exemption from Coal Tax</h3>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Coal Industry Trade Association sent a telegram to Finance Minister Song on the day before yesterday, stating: "Minister of Finance Song, Nanjing National Government, in view of the fact that all the hardships have been read, and the 20th year of January 1 has been set to implement the cut-off and all kinds of miscellaneous taxes, etc., the benevolent government has been widely applied, and all parties are joyous. From then on, the people's livelihood can be revived, and the revolution will begin successfully. 鈞长's great achievements will last forever. However, the coal tax, which has long been treated unfairly both in China and abroad, has not been mentioned in the context of the cutting off of the same line, which has caused the Chinese businessmen, who have been oppressed by foreign merchants for a long time, to hold special fears and increase the infinite concerns. In February of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the second 2200th 鈞 electrical appliance said that whether the coal tax can be changed should be viewed according to the elimination of the realization. At present, the elimination of the tax is being prepared, and the coal tax is not convenient to change in advance, etc. Also, in June 19th, the 19th year of the Republic of China, the 賦 character 10433 number 鈞批, the abolition of the coal tax should be re-examined when the elimination of the realization is implemented. Now that the elimination of the measure has been realized, the coal tax, which is treated unfairly both in China and abroad, should be abolished by Meng En to show that all are equally benefited, and Su涸鮒 is sincerely ordered to stand on the 福音. Shanghai Coal Industry Trade Association, Knocking Qiao"</p>
<h3>Inland Flour Mills</h3>
<p>Will Appeal for Exemption from Special Flour Tax</p>
<p>The Trade Association Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Progress</p>
<p>The inland flour mills, because of this year's business decline, bear too much burden and intend to present a request to the government to exempt them from the special tax. The general idea is that flour is a kind of food for the people and has always been exempt from the sales tax. Since July of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the government, on the premise of abolishing the wheat tax,創辦 the special wheat flour tax, levying one corner of tax per bag. At that time, the inland factories, which were mostly located in wheat-producing areas, purchased wheat locally and never had a wheat tax. The sudden increase in flour tax made it extremely difficult to bear. They ran around calling for exemption. Later, the Ministry of Finance approved a fair solution. The inland factories in Jiangnan were given a 30% bonus, the inland factories in Jiangbei were given a 40% bonus, and the Shanghai factories still paid according to the fixed rate. Last year, at the request of the Shanghai flour mills, it was changed again to the inland factories in Jiangnan were given a 35% bonus, the inland factories in Jiangbei were given a 45% bonus, and the Shanghai factories were given a 15% bonus. The government clearly understands the difficulties of the business community. At that time, the inland factories believed that the military affairs were not yet stable and the national revolution was not yet completed, so they had to temporarily embrace the spirit of sacrifice to fulfill their duty as citizens. However, this year, the wheat harvest was poor. At the time of the new wheat's arrival, the raw materials were scarce and the wheat prices soared. Inland bandits were rampant, transportation was blocked, flour sales were short, and prices fell instead, resulting in machine shutdowns, business closures, and losses that could not be supported. It is found that most countries in the world do not levy taxes on food for the people. Now that our country's military affairs are settled and the north and south are unified, it is in the early stages of construction, so it should also be based on the concept of world harmony, according to the Prime Minister's 生民主, develop inland industries, increase domestic production, and exempt or reduce the tax rate on all food taxes. Flour is a kind of food for the people, especially a necessity for the poor, and it is exempt from special taxes from now on. Not only will it reduce the cost of manufacturers and maintain a line of survival, but it will also reduce the burden on the people and protect the vitality of the people. The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui inland mechanized flour mill trade association convened an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss and actively proceed.</p>
<h3>Ministry Orders Commodity Inspection Bureau</h3>
<p>To Receive Agricultural Product Inspection Institute</p>
<p>To Send Personnel to Receive on the 22nd</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau received a telegram from Minister of Industry Kong yesterday, ordering it to receive the Agricultural Product Inspection Institute established by the former Ministry of Agriculture and Mining. The original telegram said: "The two ministries of agriculture and industry have been formally established as the Ministry of Industry, and all inspection institutes established by the former Ministry of Agriculture and Mining should be immediately abolished. All commodities should still be inspected by the Commodity Inspection Bureau in accordance with the regulations in order to increase the credit of Chinese and foreign trade. Those that do not need to be inspected should be cancelled to benefit agriculture and commerce and avoid redundancy. The Shanghai and Guangzhou Agricultural Product Inspection Institutes and the Tianjin Inspection Branch should be received by the local Commodity Inspection Bureaus for separate handling. The remaining inspection branches should be considered by the relevant inspection bureaus and submitted for approval. The former director of the Shanghai Agricultural Product Inspection Institute, Jin Wensi, is transferred to the ministry to work. The former deputy director, Cai Wuji, is temporarily transferred to serve as deputy director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau. The current director of the Guangzhou Inspection Institute, Kuang Songling, is temporarily transferred to serve as deputy director of the Guangzhou Commodity Inspection Bureau. The former director of the Tianjin Inspection Branch, Cao Dianxia, is to be appointed by the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau. They should be obeyed and reported again. Furthermore, the government's holding of inspections is originally to increase international trade credit and promote commodity improvement. Each bureau director must understand this intention, seek truth from facts, earnestly organize the current inspection matters, and submit a plan for reform for review and decision. Cut Cut)" After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has scheduled to send personnel to the Shanghai Agricultural Product Inspection Institute on the 22nd of this month to handle the reception matters.</p>
<h3>Petition from the Overseas Chinese Federation</h3>
<p>Regarding the Issue of Revising the Passport Law</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation, recognizing that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is accommodating various parties' requests for improvements to the provisional passport law, has newly drafted a detailed charter and requested the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Legislative Yuan for review. Therefore, the federation respectfully presents the following eight points to the Legislative Yuan, extracted from the petition:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the petition, the federation notes that Article 20 of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' provisional regulations for overseas passports and Article 14 of the provisional regulations for issuing return passports to overseas Chinese and visas to foreigners entering China involve excessive fees and numerous errors. Based on the opinions submitted by the Chinese General Chambers of Commerce in French Indochina, British Singapore, Penang, Malacca, Selangor, Perak, Kuala Lumpur, Labis, Muar, Batu Pahat, Mentakab, Kuantan, and other ports, as well as ten organizations in Dutch Surabaya and Semarang, a telegram was presented to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and the Executive Yuan of the National Government, outlining ten reasons against the regulations. Subsequently, representatives were elected to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promptly revoke or revise the regulations by a specific date. Recently, Representative Wu sent a letter stating that Vice Minister Li Jinlun had mentioned that the passport fee had been decided to be reduced from six yuan to fifty cents, and the validity period had been extended from one year to four years. Furthermore, reports in the newspapers quoted foreign affairs officials as saying that the newly revised passport regulations had been submitted to the Executive Yuan and forwarded to your esteemed Legislative Yuan for review. At this time of reform, the federation deeply feels the urgent need for relief. Therefore, the federation ventures to present eight points of humble opinion, hoping that you, honorable leaders and legislators, will grant your consideration.</p>
<p>(1) Passport fees should be reduced to the lowest possible level. The purpose of passports is to protect overseas Chinese. Consulates and embassies have an inescapable responsibility to issue passports. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should not use this as a means to increase revenue, and consulates and embassies should especially not take advantage of this to seek profits. The level of passport fees should be determined by the cost of printing passports and materials. The original provisional passport law of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stipulated a fee of six yuan per passport, a sudden increase of two to five times the original price set by the Northern Government, resulting in criticisms of "high-priced paper" and a failure to benefit overseas Chinese. In recent years, overseas newspapers have criticized this almost daily. If the fee is reduced to fifty cents, the overseas Chinese community will likely be pleased. For hardworking laborers, the fee should still be reduced by half. The federation earnestly requests your esteemed Legislative Yuan to pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>(2) Passport stamps should be specially exempted. The original provisional passport law of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stipulated that in addition to the six yuan passport fee, stamp duties of thirty cents to two yuan were required. It is argued that when Chinese citizens go abroad, it is not the same as when foreigners come to China. The latter often bring wealth, while the former leave their homes impoverished. The migration of people from Fujian and Guangdong to Southeast Asia is no different from soldiers from Korea and Zhao being conscripted, it is not something they enjoy, but rather an escape from hardship. Even a burden of a few cents adds to their suffering. Therefore, it is proposed that, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Interior for issuing certificates of nationality to overseas Chinese, special consideration should be given to exempting them from stamp duties. The federation earnestly requests your esteemed Legislative Yuan to pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>(3) Whether to obtain a passport or not should be left to the freedom of the people. In the past, Chinese citizens traveling to Southeast Asia were exempt from passports. Because of this exemption, Sun Yat-sen was able to travel freely, and high-ranking officials were able to visit various regions. Many revolutionary pioneers were able to seek refuge and protect themselves. It can be said that the Republic of China was aided by the benefits of passport exemption. In 1921, the Dutch East Indies Government Gazette, No. 170, stated that "Oriental laborers born in the Chinese Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay States do not need to have their passports checked if they are entering in good faith." In 1925, Gazette No. 444 stated that "Citizens of Switzerland, Japan, and the Kingdom of Liechtenstein do not need to have their passports checked." The federation believes that Chinese laborers going abroad should be treated the same as citizens of Switzerland, Japan, and other countries, and should be exempt from passport checks. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in order to increase passport fees, stipulated in Article 2 of the provisional regulations for return passports that "Applicants for return passports must present their departure passports to be issued." Article 10 also stipulated that "Citizens who return to the country without a return passport will be detained by the customs at the port of entry for investigation." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' issuance of passports is not based on the needs of the people, but rather to force people to purchase them. These coercive clauses should be deleted, and the people should be allowed to choose freely. If the other party requires a passport, the people will naturally purchase one. As for returning to one's own country, there is no need to obtain a passport. The federation earnestly requests your esteemed Legislative Yuan to pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>(4) There should be no need to exchange for a new passport during the period of residence. Article 11 of the original provisional regulations for overseas passports stated that "Passports are valid for one year. If one wishes to continue residing after the expiration date, one should present the old passport to the local or nearby Chinese embassy or consulate for cancellation and exchange for a new passport, and pay the fee again. Old passports that are not exchanged after the expiration date will be invalid." This is not only a way to extort money but also an unnecessary disturbance. If the intention is to investigate the number of overseas Chinese, the embassies and consulates abroad already have the power to advise overseas Chinese to report themselves upon arrival and departure, and for relatives or friends to report deaths or births. Even without exchanging passports, this information can still be known. If the intention is to obtain more revenue by having overseas Chinese exchange passports every year, then this turns the Ministry of Foreign Affairs into a Ministry of Finance, treating passport issuance as tax collection. This increases the burden and hardship on overseas Chinese and damages the Party's and the nation's reputation. The federation, loving the Party and the country, believes that this is unacceptable. Even the Foreign Vice-Minister has spoken of extending the validity period to four years, but if safeguarding is no longer necessary, why go to this trouble? The federation earnestly requests your esteemed Legislative Yuan to pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>(5) The guarantor system for passport applications should be abolished. The original provisional passport law of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stipulated a passport fee of six yuan and a stamp duty of thirty cents to two yuan. However, the fees paid by those going abroad in Xiamen were as high as 21.5 yuan, and in Hong Kong, they were extorted up to 26 yuan, with solid evidence. The reason for this is Article 9 of the provisional regulations for overseas passports, which stipulates that "Applicants for ordinary passports should submit a written request along with the following guarantee documents to the passport issuing agency for approval. Those going abroad for business should submit a letter of guarantee from two local chambers of commerce or reputable firms, and certify the amount of their capital. Those going abroad for work should submit a letter of guarantee from two local labor unions or reputable firms, and certify their work skills." Not everyone can seek help from the chambers of commerce and labor unions, and it is even more difficult to find reputable firms. Even if one is found, the passport issuer may have other motives and often deliberately nitpicks. One firm may be deemed not "reputable," and another may be deemed not "solid." The location may be in the concession or far inland, or one firm may still be lacking. After repeated attempts, it is impossible to obtain the passport in eight or ten days. Cunning travel agencies take the opportunity to extort exorbitant fees. The original price is only seven or eight yuan, but they demand twenty or thirty yuan. All of this is due to the troublesome "guarantee" clause. If the harsh "guarantee" law is not abolished, the fee of fifty cents can be raised to fifty yuan. The goal is money, and the certifications are all fictitious, causing hardship to the common people without any practical benefit. If this system is not abolished, the malpractices will be difficult to eliminate. The federation earnestly requests your esteemed Legislative Yuan to pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>(6) Registration of overseas Chinese should be allowed free of charge. Before the provisional passport law of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was enacted, Dutch East Indies and American Philippines had already implemented "Overseas Chinese Registration." The registration fee was two Dutch guilders or two Philippine pesos, and it was necessary to re-register and pay the fee every year. If implemented universally, annual revenue could reach tens of millions. After the enactment of the provisional passport law, it is unclear whether the "Overseas Chinese Registration" item has been canceled. Now that the passport regulations have been revised, those who have passports must register with the local or nearby Chinese embassy or consulate upon arrival at their destination, and those who do not have passports can also be advised to register according to the law. Given the weakness of our country's diplomacy and the incompetence of most consuls who sit idly in their offices, it is reasonable to ask them to handle registration. The new passport regulations should exempt all registration fees, demonstrating the transparency of registration and avoiding double taxation. The federation earnestly requests your esteemed Legislative Yuan to pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>(7) The visa fee for foreigners coming to China should be strictly in accordance with the visa fee charged by their respective countries for Chinese passports. Article 8 of the provisional regulations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for issuing return passports to overseas Chinese and visas to foreigners coming to China originally had this provision. However, Chinese people are inherently exclusive, extorting extra from their compatriots while offering discounts to foreigners. For example, the visa fee for Chinese passports issued by foreign consulates in Xiamen is US$9 per passport for the United States, six Dutch guilders for the Netherlands (doubled outside office hours), six Japanese yen for Japan, and four and a half shillings for the United Kingdom. Logically, according to the law, our country should charge the same visa fee for passports of citizens of these countries. However, the Xiamen visa issuing agency is particularly obsequious to foreigners, charging only one yuan for stamp duty and no visa fee. The new passport regulations should clearly stipulate that anyone who secretly offers discounts must be held responsible for the full amount. The federation earnestly requests your esteemed Legislative Yuan to pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>(8) Whether or not to detain and investigate foreigners who have not obtained visas should depend on the treatment of overseas Chinese in their respective countries. Article 9 of the provisional regulations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for issuing return passports to overseas Chinese and visas to foreigners coming to China stipulates that "Foreigners coming to China without a visa from a Chinese embassy or consulate should be detained by the customs at the port of entry for investigation." The wording seems very strict, but in reality, it is rarely enforced. The new passport regulations should effectively enforce this. However, our country's foreign policy should seek only equality and mutual benefit. If various regions in Southeast Asia offer passport exemptions to Chinese citizens entering their countries, then our country should offer the same treatment to citizens of those regions coming to China. In fact, more Chinese people go to Southeast Asia than people from Southeast Asia come to China, which is still beneficial to us. The federation earnestly requests your esteemed Legislative Yuan to pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>The above eight points are merely a brief outline. Your esteemed Legislative Yuan, with your foresight and wisdom, surely already has a plan. Therefore, not hesitating to intrude, we sincerely petition in response to the urging of overseas Chinese and driven by our conscience. We humbly request that you consider our loyalty and adopt our suggestions. Not only will millions of overseas Chinese benefit from your great virtue, but the improvement of the passport law will also make it easier to go abroad and return home, bringing infinite benefits to the livelihood of the people and the financial stability of society.</p>

<h3>Shanghai International Settlement</h3>
<p>Two Kidnapping Cases Yesterday</p>
<p>Ding Ziren and Chen Shifan</p>
<p>Kidnappings in Shanghai have become increasingly rampant recently. Following the kidnapping of real estate merchant Lu Shaotang the day before yesterday, two more kidnapping cases occurred within the Shanghai International Settlement yesterday. The victims were Ding Ziren, manager of the Fuxin Flour Mill's second factory, and Chen Shifan of the Chenlinji Real Estate Company. Both had their own cars, and the kidnappers hijacked the cars, drove the chauffeurs out midway, and then drove the hostages away. Both cars have been found, but the whereabouts of the individuals are still unknown.</p>
<p>Ding Ziren Kidnapped at Noon</p>
<p>Ding Ziren, a native of Wuxi, is the manager of the Fuxin Flour Mill's second and eighth factories. He has his own car, number 3876. He usually works at the Fuxin Second Factory on Moganshan Road, but due to business matters, he often goes to the Maoxin Fuxin head office at 58 Jiangxi Road, so he uses his car to travel between the two places. However, the time is uncertain. Yesterday, around 11:30 AM, Ding Ziren needed to go to the head office on Jiangxi Road. He ordered his chauffeur, Shen Xiaocheng, to prepare the car. About five minutes later, Ding got into the car. Just as they were about to drive off, five kidnappers suddenly appeared in the misty rain. Three of them held handguns. One kidnapper held a gun to the chauffeur's chest, ordering him to be silent. The other kidnappers jumped into the car and ordered the hostage not to make a sound. Then the kidnappers drove off, taking Tokyo Road south and disappearing in an instant. The incident occurred in the Pudu Road police precinct. After learning of the news, Western and Chinese detectives were immediately dispatched to investigate, but because the kidnappers' car had gone far away, there were no clues to be found. It was not until 4:00 PM that the victim's car, number 3876, was found near Robert Road and Jessfield Road. However, although the car was recovered, the person was gone, and Ding's whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>Chen Shifan Victimized in the Evening</p>
<p>Ten hours after the kidnapping of Ding Ziren, manager of the Fuxin Flour Mill, a similar incident occurred on Pingwang Street in the Public Concession. The victim was Chen Shifan, who runs real estate and construction businesses. The Chen family lives at 114 Bushi Road in the French Concession, and Chenlinji Real Estate Company is located at 40 Pingwang Street in the Public Concession. He spends several hours there every day. Chen also owns a car, number 2685. Last night, around 9:30 PM, Chen finished his work and intended to return home. He got into the car at the Fuzhili intersection. Just as the door was closing, four kidnappers suddenly rushed forward in the rain. Two kidnappers held handguns and jumped into the car. One kidnapper pointed a gun at the chauffeur, ordering him not to shout. The other kidnapper pointed a gun at Chen's chest, asking him not to speak loudly. Chen had no choice but to submit to the kidnappers' control. The kidnappers drove forward, traveling along Guangdong Road and Xizang Road to the intersection of Rue Sainte Marie and Avenue Foch in the French Concession. The kidnappers pushed the chauffeur out of the car, accelerated, and drove the hostage Chen Shifan away. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared without a trace. The chauffeur had no choice but to rush to the French police station to report the incident. At this time, the Public Concession Police Department also received the news. Since the kidnappers' car was driving in the western district, the Jing'an Temple Road police station dispatched Western and Chinese detectives in cars to patrol. Around 11:30 PM, they suddenly saw Chen's car, number 2685, found near Yuyuan Road and Yuyuan Fang. However, the car was recovered, but the person was gone, just like Ding Ziren's case.</p>
<h3>Hankou Airplane</h3>
<p>Landed on the Bund Yesterday</p>
<p>Right Lower Wing Touched a Small Steamboat</p>
<p>Fuselage Slightly Damaged, No Major Problem</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's "Hankou" (No. 3) airplane, carrying military mail from Hankou, flew to Shanghai on a scheduled flight yesterday. Around 4:00 PM, after passing through Wusong and following the Huangpu River to Shanghai, it arrived at the Taikoo Company's wharf at Lanmudu in Pudong. Due to the strong winds in the air and the hazy rain, the pilot decided to stop the plane and land on the Huangpu River for safety reasons. Unexpectedly, at that time, the Taikoo Company's "Kwaitong" steamboat was sailing on the Huangpu River. The plane's wheel and the steamboat were unable to avoid each other, so the plane's right lower wing touched the steamboat's wing end, causing slight damage. The plane's nose was also slightly damaged, but there were no major problems. There were two Chinese and Western pilots on board, and fortunately, they were not injured. After the incident, Vice Pilot Hua Li hired several laborers to tie ropes and drag the plane to a vacant area south of the Taikoo Company for a temporary stop. At the same time, the customs' tax patrol ship ordered several sailors to go ashore to protect the plane. Before long, the surrounding area was crowded with onlookers. Zhang, the district head of Pudong's third district, also dispatched police officers to the scene to maintain order. The two pilots took the mail from the plane back to the company for delivery. The plane's fuselage was temporarily parked overnight, and the third district police were requested to guard it overnight. Whether the plane can fly again today or needs to be repaired first will be decided by the company.</p>

<p>Yongshengchang Gold Shop, located at 65 Yuxing Lane, Beijing Road, is a large commercial enterprise jointly established by Gu Yuanruo, Wang Boyuan, Wu Shanqing, You Yanghe, and others. The business was quite prosperous, but recently, it suddenly suspended operations due to financial difficulties. The shareholders questioned the manager, Shi Yulin (also known as Yu Quan), the runner, Shi Xianglin (also known as Xiangling), and the accountant, Huang Hongxuan (also known as Hongxuan), about the losses, but the Shis could not provide an answer. The shareholders then checked the accounts at Gu Yuanruo's home at 2 Gujia Lane, Beijing Road. As a result, they found that the three had embezzled public funds and falsified accounts totaling about hundreds of thousands. They reported to the General Police Department, which ordered detectives Wang Jinsheng and Sun Aizhong to arrest the three and bring them to the Special District Court for questioning. The details have been recorded in this newspaper during the adjournment. The plaintiffs' lawyers, Wang Yunshang, Chen Zhongyin, Tao Wuzhi, and others, found that the total amount of embezzlement by Shi Yulin and others was about 177,000 taels of silver, but there were still some undiscovered embezzlements. The details of each item are listed below: (1) Falsely creating the purchase and sale of 50,000 yuan in Donghui notes, resulting in a loss of 8,500 taels of silver; (2) Falsely creating the purchase and sale of 100,000 yuan in Donghui notes, resulting in a loss of 5,062 taels and 5 qian of silver; (3) Falsely creating the purchase and sale of 50,000 yuan in Donghui notes, resulting in a loss of 850 taels of silver; (4) Embezzling 94,647 taels and 7 qian through the Yingjie Heji account; (5) Embezzling 8,208 taels and 4 fen through the Yingjie Lingji account; (6) Embezzling 8,332 taels, 9 qian, and 7 fen through the Yingjie Yongdeji account; (7) Embezzling 5,541 taels and 6 qian through the Yingjie Baoji account; (8) Lingji and others owed 16,970 taels, 0 qian, 7 fen, and 4 li; (9) Embezzling 9,348 taels, 8 qian, 6 fen, and 8 li through the Yingjie Deji account; (10) Falsely creating accounts and embezzling 3,812 taels and 5 qian; (11) Falsely creating accounts and embezzling 12,075 taels, 3 qian, and 2 fen; (12) Embezzling 4,000 yuan of deposits from the JinCheng Bank. Wang, Chen, and Tao presented the detailed accounts and methods of embezzlement in a lawsuit to the court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhou Hanting opened the court to continue questioning. The defendants also hired lawyers Chen Tingrui and Chen Ying to defend them. According to lawyer Ru BaoYi of the police department, the 12 cases that have been investigated have detailed lawsuits from the plaintiff, so there is no need for the police department lawyer to make further arguments. Wang Boyuan, the representative of the plaintiff, then described the behavior of the defendants in detail and presented the account books for inspection. Huang Hongxuan testified that many transactions were ordered by Gu Yuanruo, the assistant manager and major shareholder, but Gu denied this. The defendant's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, said that he had just been appointed and was not yet fully aware of the content, requesting a postponement of the hearing. Judge Zhou granted the request and ordered the three defendants to be remanded and rescheduled for a hearing in one week.</p>
<h3>Liu Xunfang Accused of</h3>
<p>Damaging the Reputation of Liangjiang</p>
<p>Lu Lihua Testified in Court</p>
<p>Saying He Had Never Offended Him</p>
<p>Why Would He Harbor Such Resentment</p>
<p>Liu Xunfang Denied Everything</p>
<p>Liu Xunfang (31 years old, from Nantong), the former clerk of the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, was dismissed by the school's principal, Lu Lihua, for negligence of duty during his tenure. Liu, after leaving the school, allegedly used the name of Wang Xinming, the guardian of the school's students, to damage the school's reputation and defame Principal Lu Lihua (1) defrauding money, (2) swindling, (3) neglecting training, (4) having no equipment, (5) ruining teaching, (6) enriching himself by collecting money, and other six items. He requested the Education Bureau to punish him and submitted articles to a newspaper requesting disclosure. After Wang Xinming learned of the matter, he sent a letter denying the incident. Principal Lu immediately began an investigation and went to the newspaper to retrieve the original manuscript, comparing the handwriting and finding that it was written by Liu Xunfang. She then submitted the drafts written by Liu Xunfang while he was at the school to the Second District Police Department, requesting Liu's arrest. Liu confessed to the false accusation and stated that Chen was behind it. Chen was then ordered to be arrested, but he had already fled and was not captured. Liu Xunfang was sent to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the District Court Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. It is now known that prosecutor Zhao Zhiqiu has filed a public prosecution, citing Article 180, Paragraph 1, and Article 325, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law, combined with Article 153, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law. Lu Lihua hired lawyer Xu Shichang to submit a complaint, requesting that the defamation be retracted in an advertisement on the front page of Shanghai newspapers for seven days. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Chengjun opened the court for trial. The plaintiff, Lu Lihua, accompanied by her lawyer, testified that she was 28 years old and from Qingpu. The defendant, Liu Xunfang, was previously a clerk at the school and was dismissed for negligence of duty during his tenure. He did not expect that the defendant would harbor resentment and damage the school's reputation and publish defamatory articles in various Shanghai small publications and leaflets. He had never offended him while Liu Xunfang was working at the school, so why would he harbor such resentment? Furthermore, the defendant is a member of the upper class society, so why would he engage in such lowly behavior? The defendant, Liu Xunfang, testified that he is currently working as a clerk at the China Sports School. He previously worked at the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School for just over a year and had no opinions about Principal Lu. The documents presented to the Education Bureau and published in the newspaper were not written by him, and he requested the court to investigate. When asked if he had confessed to the Second District Police Department that the documents were issued by him, he replied that he had not confessed. However, the district chief said that if someone had instructed him to do so, he might as well say so and it would not be his fault. At this point, the judge stated that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned for further deliberation.</p>
<h3>Hu Die's Marriage Dispute Statement</h3>
<p>Blaming Lin Xuehuai and Asking for Seven Things</p>
<p>The case of the marriage dispute between movie star Hu Die and her fiancé Lin Xuehuai has been submitted to the Special District Court by Hu Die's lawyers, Zhan Jifeng, requesting a summons for verification. The original complaint states:</p>
<p>Plaintiff: Hu Die, represented by lawyer Zhan Jifeng</p>
<p>Defendant: Lin Xuehuai</p>
<p>Regarding the complaint of unwarranted termination of engagement and the request for compensation for damages and debts, the facts and reasons of this case are detailed below for your review.</p>
<p>(Facts)</p>
<p>The plaintiff is from a respected Cantonese family and has always upheld etiquette. Since coming to Shanghai to seek independence for women, she has devoted herself to the screen. Although she is somewhat famous, she has always abided by the husband’s moral instruction. She then met and got to know the defendant, Lin Xuehuai. At first, she saw that his appearance was sincere and he seemed like a gentleman. Moreover, he was very attentive to the plaintiff, asking questions and showing concern. The plaintiff, being inexperienced in the world, was moved. The defendant then asked a friend to propose marriage to the plaintiff's family. The plaintiff, deceived by his sincerity, agreed. In 1927, with the consent of both parents, they held an engagement ceremony at the Yuegong Hotel on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai. After that, the plaintiff treated the defendant as her fiancé, and the plaintiff's parents also regarded him as a promising son-in-law. Initially, they subsidized his education, and then they loaned him money to start a business, providing continuous financial assistance. It was unexpected that the defendant did not cherish himself, did not seek to improve, and used the money provided by the plaintiff for gambling and dance halls. The plaintiff repeatedly advised him without effect. One night in mid-November of this year, she learned that the defendant was again wasting money at the Paris Dance Hall, so she went to investigate in person. Unexpectedly, she saw the defendant embracing his lover and dancing wildly to the music. Afterwards, the plaintiff advised him again, but instead angered him. He then hired lawyer E Sen to send a letter requesting the termination of the engagement. In the letter, he fabricated rumors and falsely accused the plaintiff of improper conduct, saying that he had broken off relations with the plaintiff. The plaintiff, thinking that she was being falsely accused and that he wanted to terminate the engagement, was filled with sadness and indignation. She thought that she had met another Wang Kui who was ungrateful. The breakdown of love was even more heartbreaking. In her grief and anger, she replied to the defendant, denying his false accusations and stating that she would agree to the termination of the engagement if there were appropriate conditions. She then received another letter reiterating his previous statement, but without proposing any reasonable conditions or reasons for terminating the engagement, leaving the plaintiff at a loss. This is the course of the case and the responsibility of the defendant for the unwarranted termination of the engagement of the plaintiff, who has no fault.</p>
<p>(Reasons)</p>
<p>It has been three years since the plaintiff and defendant were engaged. The defendant, however, has changed his mind and wants to achieve his goal of loving the new and abandoning the old. He does not hesitate to fabricate rumors to damage her reputation and has twice sent letters requesting termination of the engagement. His words of breaking off relations are his true feelings. If the plaintiff forces him to fulfill the engagement, there will be no good outcome. Therefore, it is better to break the mirror today than to wait for it to break in the future. A woman's youthful years are the golden age, and precious time should not be wasted. The plaintiff has been restricted by the engagement with the defendant, wasting time for three years, which is no short time. But the defendant suddenly changed his mind and broke the engagement, causing damage to the plaintiff's spirit and reputation. In terms of law and human emotions, this cannot be lightly forgiven. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 970 to 79 of the Civil Code, the party who is not at fault in the termination of the engagement may claim damages from the other party who is at fault. It is requested that the court order the defendant to pay the plaintiff compensation and the debt. (Details of the accounts are omitted)</p>
<p>For the above reasons, it is requested that your court quickly summon the defendant to court for a clear determination and make the following judgments:</p>
<p>(1) Order the approval of the termination of the engagement between both parties.</p>
<p>(2) Order the repayment of the overdue debt.</p>
<p>(3) Order the repayment of the loan from the Da Ming Xing Company.</p>
<p>(4) Order the return of the car or its cash equivalent.</p>
<p>(5) Award the plaintiff consolation money.</p>
<p>(6) Order that the amounts to be compensated bear the legal interest from the date of the lawsuit until the end of the execution.</p>
<p>(7) Order the defendant to bear the litigation costs of this case.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted.</p>

Subsequently, the forensic doctor reported that the deceased had three bullet wounds: one in the chest, one in the abdomen, and one in the back, all of which had penetrated through the body. Afterwards, Lu's family employee, Chen Qing'an, pleaded to claim the body for coffin and burial, stating that although the master had been kidnapped, the family would still provide generous compensation and a lavish funeral for the deceased. Prosecutor Guo then instructed that the body be handed over to Chen Qing'an after he provided a guarantee for claiming the body and burial, instructed the employer to provide condolences, and ordered the police to strictly investigate the murderers, bring them to justice, and punish them.</p>

However, Mr. Jia was already betrothed, only engaged but not yet married, but he always concealed this fact from Chen. Suddenly, Mr. Jia received a letter from home stating that a lucky day had been chosen and a date set for the wedding, ordering him to pack immediately and return home to arrange everything. After receiving the letter, Mr. Jia made excuses to Chen, saying that he was returning home to settle family matters and would return to Shanghai after everything was done. Unexpectedly, the plan was not airtight, and Chen discovered the truth as soon as Mr. Jia set off. She immediately felt weary of the world and secretly swallowed a large amount of opium at 10 PM last night, attempting to end her life. She was discovered, rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but succumbed to the severe poisoning, passing away in the hospital at 4 AM yesterday morning. The hospital notified the Old Zha Police Station, which transported the body to the forensic examination office on Faelon Road for examination.</p>

<h3>Staff of Two Railways Earnestly Request Xie Yingrui to Stay</h3>
<p>Since Xie Yingrui, the Chief Medical Officer of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, was appointed to take charge of the medical affairs of the two railways, he has perfected all medical facilities on the railways. In view of the fact that the railway bureau lacked a self-sufficient hospital, he specially recovered the residence of the former foreign superintendent built on Fanwangdu this spring and converted it into a railway sanatorium, so that all railway employees could have a place to recuperate when they were sick. This move has set an unprecedented example for all railways in the country, so the employees of the railway are all grateful to Xie. Now it is learned that Xie has recently been ordered by the Ministry to be transferred to the Jiaoji Railway. The employees of the railway, upon hearing the news, believe that although Xie has only been on the railway for a short time, all the unfinished plans are waiting to be gradually reformed, and the established equipment still needs to be presided over and rectified. Therefore, they have jointly signed a petition to the Ministry of Railways to withdraw the order.</p>

<h3>Mirror of Blacklisted People</h3>
<p>Country Woman Posing as Rich Man's Concubine</p>
<p>Chen Liangchun's Circumstances are Pitiful</p>
<p>Chen Liangchun, a resident of Chenjiazhai in Datong, Baoshan, is 32 years old. His family was well-off, but his parents passed away early. Seven years ago, he married a Zhou woman, aged 25, who was beautiful. The couple had a very good relationship. However, Chen became addicted to opium and did not engage in production, so the family declined. At first, Zhou was able to live with it, but by June of this year, Chen's family property had been mortgaged and daily life was difficult. Zhou was unable to stay at home and left her husband to work as a servant in the house of a wealthy Zhang family in Shanghai. Zhang's son saw that Zhou was beautiful and seduced her in every possible way. After a long time, they had an affair and built a love nest in a certain lane on Tangshan Road in Hongkou, Shanghai. Zhou went from a servant to a concubine of a rich man, bossing people around, and seemed to have forgotten her former life of poverty. Her husband, Chen Liangchun, still thought that his wife was working as a servant and had no idea of the inside story. Chen's life was even worse than before. He lacked clothes and food, and when his addiction flared up and he had no money to buy opium, he injected morphine to relieve the emergency. His plight was truly different from Zhou's. On the 15th of this month, Chen came to Shanghai on foot to find Zhou at the Zhang family's house because of his difficult life, hoping to get money to return home and live. Because he did not see his wife, he asked Zhang's servants and others about the situation. Only then did he learn the truth. He went to Tangshan Road to find Zhou, but Zhou, having a new love, forgot her old lover and closed the door on him. Chen was helpless and returned to his hometown. He was overwhelmed with grief and wanted to commit suicide. On the night before last, he hanged himself, but was rescued by neighbors. After learning about the situation, the neighbors were very angry and immediately sent someone to accompany Chen Liangchun to Shanghai yesterday to negotiate with the Zhang family and Zhou. The Zhang family and Zhou knew that they were in the wrong and agreed to give Chen one thousand yuan to sever the relationship. Chen agreed because he had this huge sum of money to maintain his life. A written agreement was drawn up, and the two parties divorced from then on.</p>
<h3>Postponement of Municipal Council Meeting</h3>
<p>It is heard that the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council will be postponed to Tuesday at 4:30 PM next week due to Christmas.</p>
<h3>Trial of the Xue Family Property Dispute Opens</h3>
<p>If the Defendant Fails to Appear Again</p>
<p>The Property Will Be Seized and Executed</p>
<p>Xue Guqiaolin, the father of the late giant pigment merchant Xue Baorun, i.e. Liquan, and his son Xue Bao and Bao, hired lawyers Zheng Yuxiu and Zhu Wenfu to sue his legal mother Xue Sun and his brothers Xue Jiasheng, Gansheng, Gensheng, and Yansheng in the civil court of the French court, accusing them of forcibly occupying the inheritance and pleading to divide it according to law. The petition stated that the late father, Liquan, passed away in August of this year, and the inheritance of more than ten million yuan was forcibly occupied by the legal mother Sun and his brothers Xue Jiasheng and others. The share that the plaintiff should have inherited was concealed and not divided, intending to embezzle it, and the lives of the plaintiff's mother and son could not be maintained. They even sent hooligans to harm the plaintiff, but fortunately they were prevented in advance. Considering that the right of women to inherit property is granted by law, now because of the selfishness of the legal mother and the jealousy of the brothers, the plaintiff is displaced and dare not attend the funeral. Recalling that the late father visited them once every day, caring for them in every way, from clothing to food to warmth. They have submitted this petition to request the court to summon the legal mother Sun and his brothers Xue Jiasheng and others to order them to divide the property equally according to law. After the petition was approved, the defendants were summoned yesterday but did not arrive. Lawyer Lin Yingqing acted as an agent, claiming that the defendants all lived at No. 18 Guangdong Road in the Public Concession, and that the main body of the plaintiff's accusation was wrong and should be sued in the Special Zone Court, and that the reasons for the plaintiff's accusation were not yet clear. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that Xue Liquan lived on Xiafei Road for many years, which is well known to everyone, so how could it be said that the jurisdiction was inconsistent. It is now heard that Sun is about to sell all the property, and once it is implemented, the plaintiff's share of the property will be in danger. Since this case is a rescheduled hearing, the court should first seize and execute Xue's property. The judge Gong ordered that the hearing be rescheduled. If the defendants fail to appear again, they will be allowed to seize and execute the property.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Wang Hanlun Cigarette Case</h3>
<p>The Defendant Should Stop Selling Cigarettes</p>
<p>But is Not Liable for Compensation</p>
<p>Film star Wang Hanlun hired lawyer Lan Xuzhang to sue the Dadongnan Tobacco Company, the agent of the Jianhua Tobacco Company, in the French court, accusing it of infringing on her right of name with the Wang Hanlun cigarette, claiming damages for reputation loss of 30,000 yuan and a portrait fee of 10 yuan per carton. Zhang Xinliang, manager of the defendant Dadongnan Company, also hired lawyer Lu Qi to handle the defense. After three court hearings, the parties were instructed to wait for the verdict. The various circumstances have been recorded in previous reports. Judge Gong issued a verdict yesterday, and the original text is recorded as follows: In the case of the dispute over the right of name between the plaintiff Wang Hanlun and the defendant Dadongnan Tobacco Company, the defendant should stop selling the Wang Hanlun brand cigarettes in its possession. The plaintiff's request for compensation for losses should be dismissed, and the litigation costs should be borne by the plaintiff. The plaintiff's request is based on the two official letters from the Hebei Cigarette Unified Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Cigarette Unified Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, which recognized that the defendant infringed on her right of name. After detailed verification of the contents of the two letters, the letter from the Ministry of Finance Unified Tax Office did not clearly state that the defendant was the producing company of the Wang Hanlun brand cigarettes and stated that the trademark printed on the sample was Jianhua Tobacco Company. This is consistent with the contract book and newspaper that the defendant submitted. Moreover, the plaintiff denied the existence of the Jianhua Company. After investigation, it was confirmed that Jianhua was indeed in the process of liquidation. Therefore, there is no doubt that the Wang Hanlun brand cigarettes were ordered by the Jianhua Company from the Dadongnan Company. As for how its registration procedures were, whether it intended to evade taxes and violate the current regulations is not relevant to this case. Whether Jianhua obtained the plaintiff's consent, the plaintiff did not sue the company but sued the defendant, which is a mistake of the main body. However, since the plaintiff denied that it was with consent, the defendant should stop selling Wang Hanlun brand cigarettes to protect the right of name. Based on the above reasons, the judgment is made as the main text.</p>
<h3>Elderly Man Fatally Injured by Car</h3>

At that time, the Yang family was already asleep. The bandits immediately took out their guns, shouted to silence them, and rummaged through the boxes and cabinets, wantonly looting. After about an hour, they left in a rush, fully loaded with stolen goods.

The police on duty there immediately reported to the Fire Brigade. Fortunately, the Caojiadu Fire Brigade was nearby and drove to the scene to put out the fire. In total, three rooms on the upper floor were burned down, and all the medicine shops downstairs were damaged by water. The cause of the fire was investigated by the Sixth District Police Station, which sent police to the scene, and the fire owner, Yang Heshan, was detained and brought back to the district. After being interrogated by the district chief, he immediately filed a document to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. It was also heard that the neighbors and friends of the medicine shop fortunately noticed it early and were awakened from their sleep, so there were no casualties. It is said that the photo studio had fire insurance of 5,000 taels of silver.</p>

The news obtained yesterday is recorded as follows: Selection of the venue. It is heard that the railway bureau believes that the number of attendees at this conference will be more than 100 people, so it is necessary to choose a large auditorium to avoid crowding. Therefore, it has specially sent people to contact various places. It is now known that it has been decided to use the Jiande Savings Association as the venue, because the various facilities there are quite suitable for the conference and it is very close to the railway station, which is more convenient for reception than other places.</p>
<p>Rushing to Make Souvenirs.

<p>Drafting Reception Methods. The reception methods currently drafted by the railway bureau include setting up a reception office at the Shanghai North Railway Station and ordering the stationmasters of each station to inform the train conductor to take care of each representative along the way when they depart from each station and to send a telegram to Shanghai so that personnel can be sent to board the train to greet them when the passenger train arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Gold Bar and Big Bar Market in November of the 19th Year</h3>
<p>Gold Bar. The gold bar market showed repeated peaks due to the tight foreign exchange this month. In the early part of the month, it fell sharply due to rumors of tense negotiations between China and Russia. Later, it rose again as major players scrambled to buy up the depleted quota. The highest price was 587 taels and the lowest was 574 taels and 9 cents. In the middle of the month, at the beginning, the market was expected to open up after the expiration of the ban on gold exports, so many parties increased their bets. The short sellers entered the gold market, and the gold market rose for a short time. However, the Bank of America suspended operations, and many people were panic-stricken. It was also heard that the Indian Round Table Conference had reduced the water for exchange with England, and it was feared that the big bar would increase in length, so it fell again. Its highest price was 592 taels and 5 cents, and the lowest was 575 taels and 5 cents, which was already higher than in the early part of the month. In the last ten days of the month, due to the tight foreign exchange, both overt and covert, the listed prices were repeatedly reduced, and the silver prices of British and American were also low. The hedging of goods was extremely brave, so the price continued to rise and increase sharply, almost approaching the 600 taels mark. The highest price reached 598 taels and 6 cents, and the lowest price was also 581 taels and 2 cents. The average market price for the whole month rose by 13 taels and 3 cents compared with the previous month, and the ratio was 1,624, which was 3.6 higher than the previous month. Big Bar. The big bar market was initially brisk and then loosened. In the early part of the month, the overseas silver market was quite prosperous, especially when it was rumored that the Sino-American loan would be realized. In the middle of the month, it was calmer and turned downward. Although the Mexican government recovered 10 million silver dollars, the market was not affected in any way. This was because the export source of American silver was continuous. In the last ten days of the month, the transaction was quiet and flat. The United States also took a wait-and-see attitude and did not make much progress. After the collection of the fleet, it was still mediocre and sluggish as before. The highest recent market price for the whole month was 16 pence and 8125, and the lowest was only 16 pence and 3125. The ratio was 5135, which was 0.005 lower than the previous month.</p>

<h3>Past Achievements of the Industrial Goods Testing Institute</h3>
<p>The Municipal Industrial Goods Testing Institute (Hehefang, Xiafei Road) has been established for only one year and three months, and the number of entrusted problems received, in addition to the goods sent for testing by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the coal samples and textile products automatically tested by the institute, has reached more than 1,000 from other parties. Among them, in addition to the oil, coal, and water samples of various water and electricity companies, major manufacturers in the city have frequently sent their products for testing or research. The Chinese merchants include the Commercial Press, Sanyou Industrial Company, China Chemical Industry Company, Shengde Weaving Factory, Hezhong Oil Refinery, Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory, Yonghe Industrial Company, Zhufeng Enamel Factory, Yuantai Paper Mill, China Battery Factory, Dafeng Industrial Raw Materials Company, Liujiang Coal Mine Company, Dahua Woolen Mill, Yihe Down Factory, Xinyuan Bank, Junda Bank, and dozens of others. The Western companies include Hengxin Foreign Company, Xinli Foreign Company, Nanday Foreign Company, Ellis Foreign Company, and several others. There are also Zou Chengtai Stone Powder Factory in Wuxi and Tongshengchang Company in Bangkok, Thailand. There are also a large number of items sent for testing by individuals or smaller manufacturers. The results are all very satisfactory and are well-known among manufacturers. Therefore, the business development in the second half of this year has made great progress, and the number of people who entrust testing and research has been increasing one after another. In order to awaken manufacturers to use scientific knowledge to improve industry and commerce, the institute only charges a very small handling fee for each problem to show the spirit of the municipal government serving the interests of the citizens. Compared with the Western chemical testing rooms in Shanghai, the difference is nearly ten times or more. As for the research problems that have been successfully completed, there are the manufacturing products entrusted by Xinmei Food Company, China Chemical Industry Company, etc. to be improved. The institute is now continuing to study various industrial improvement problems in order to restore rights and create benefits for society.</p>

<h3>Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Office</h3>
<p>Statement on Treasury Receipts</p>
<p>Reply to the Tobacco Exchange Association</p>
<p>The Second District Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office of Jiangsu Province yesterday replied to a letter from the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association, stating that it has replied: "We recently received a letter from your association stating that many members have reported that the 8% tariff in short-term treasury bills collected when issuing licenses for winter donations was collected by the association on behalf of the tax office with the agreement of the tax office, and then issued formal treasury bills in sections. Our office has handed over the treasury receipts collected to your association. However, recently, the tax office's collectors came to the numbers, claiming that these treasury receipts can be returned to the office for a full refund when exchanging spring commission licenses, and specially reported for a request for return so that they can be applied at maturity. We have checked this case. After our association reached a compromise with your office, is the report of the members true? We should send a special letter to inquire immediately, hoping that you will check and reply within days to dispel doubts and avoid misunderstandings. We hope so." The reply stated: "When our office collects short-term treasury bills from various merchants, the treasury receipts issued are in small amounts and are difficult to exchange for formal treasury bills. Your association was authorized to collect and exchange them on behalf of the merchants, and this was agreed upon with your association long ago. As for the statement in the report that the collectors of our office claimed to each number that these treasury receipts can be returned to the office for a full refund when exchanging spring licenses, the collectors of our office have never made such a statement. We think that your members have heard and misunderstood. We should reply by letter immediately, hoping that you will check and forward it to your members to dispel doubts. We reply to this request."</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Holders of Provisional Notes and Certificates</h3>
<p>Registration Extended to the End of This Year</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Holders of Provisional Exchange Notes of the Central Bank and National Treasury Certificates of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government twice petitioned Chairman Chiang of the National Government and Minister of Finance Soong, requesting them to consider the people's hardship and redeem the notes. Although no official reply has been received, reliable sources in political circles say that the request is likely to be accepted once Chairman Chiang returns to the capital. The Association will publicly elect representatives to go to the capital to petition as soon as Chairman Chiang returns, so as to personally present the hardships of merchants and listen to the Chairman's instructions. The selection of representatives will be decided at a meeting in the coming days. As for the registration handled by the Association, after a two-week extension, note holders from various regions have joined the registration enthusiastically. The Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce has Central Exchange Notes worth 127,485 yuan and officially sent a letter to join the registration yesterday. In addition, the Nanjing Money Trade Association and the Lishui County Chamber of Commerce have also sent letters inquiring about the registration procedures. Considering that the transportation in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces may prevent some note holders from joining the registration, the Association has extended the deadline to the end of this year. After this extension, there will be no further extensions. The registration forms will be sent to lawyers and accountants for review and preservation after the registration is completed to clarify the amount and show seriousness.</p>
<h3>Two More Branches Added to the Jisheng Society</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society has established many branches in various places. Since the establishment of the Chang'an branch in Shaanxi last winter, it has been very convenient for the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Bureau, and the efforts of the branch have also achieved results. It is now known that Nanyang in Henan Province and Yongjia in Zhejiang Province have also established branches one after another. According to reports, the chairman of the Nanyang Jisheng Branch is Yao Shiyi, and the members are Cao Xingyuan, Wang Yushan, Guo Qingzhou, Zhang Yizhong, etc. The chairman of the Yongjia Jisheng Branch in Zhejiang is Wang Chensheng, the vice chairman is Zhang Yiping, and the members are Chen Tingsheng, Ye Zhichao, etc. These dozens of people are all enthusiastic philanthropists in the area. It can be predicted that they will be able to abide by the articles of association and work hard in the future. It is found that the Jisheng Society's affairs are divided into two departments: one is regular economic undertakings, and the other is temporary relief undertakings, both of which are beneficial to society. In particular, the first priority is not to interfere in foreign affairs, but to focus on influencing people's hearts and respecting morality, so that the people can live and work in peace and contentment. If all the charitable people in China rise up to organize Jisheng branches, then the effect will be far from small.</p>

<h3>The Preciousness of Indian Elephant Yellow Huang Zhi</h3>
<p>My friend Cheng Debiao has been doing business in Calcutta, near the mouth of the Ganges River in India, for many years. He came to Shanghai yesterday and visited me at my residence. We had been separated for a long time since we were children, so we were very happy to see each other. We drank wine to wash away the dust. During the banquet, we talked about Indian politics, religion, customs, and habits. Because newspapers often publish them, I won't go into details. However, what he said about the most precious item in the Indian market is elephant yellow, which is more expensive and harder to obtain than diamonds, but is mostly used for Buddhist beads and nothing else. After saying that, he took out a string of beads, with three elephant yellow beads in it, and pointed to them to show me, and explained where elephant yellow is produced. I have recorded it on the left.</p>
<p>India is close to the tropics and has many large mountains and forests. Elephants are the most numerous animals. They are docile and can carry heavy loads over long distances, so the locals mostly raise them to transport goods. However, they also need to be trained like cattle and horses before they can be used. All elephants over a hundred years old have tumor-like growths on all four sides of their bellies. After fifty or sixty years, they form a round shape, as large as peaches and as small as walnuts. They are secretly cut off with a sharp blade, and when they are soft, they are soaked in water. Within twelve hours, famous craftsmen carve them into Buddhist beads (elephant yellow grows on the bellies of hundred-year-old elephants. When cut off, they are soft and can be carved within twelve hours. After that, they become as hard as diamonds, and nothing can break them). Holes are drilled and threads are tied, or flowers, trees, mountains, water, and human figures are carved on the beads. The shape is lifelike and the color is yellowish-white like relics. They are extremely hard and fire cannot burn them, and nothing can break them. They are only used to make Buddhist beads and nothing else. The price is extremely high. The value of one bead is several thousand or even ten thousand gold, but it is not possible to obtain one. This shows how precious the item is. It is also said that elephant yellow can be used as medicine. If decocted in soup and drunk, it can cure the disease of flattery, like gold foil can calm the heart. However, according to the Materia Medica, it does not have this effect. Indians are inherently loyal and their customs are simple and honest. All friends and relatives who are two-faced, flattering on the surface but not in their hearts, are often looked down upon and despised. The ancient Chinese proverb (he who speaks of people's rights and wrongs is himself a person of right and wrong) and (poor but not flattering, rich but not proud) are often placed on the seat to encourage themselves and serve as a motto for life. Perhaps because elephant yellow is harder than gold and stone, it makes people who drink it change their usual flattery.</p>
<p>After the China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai plane crashed, Chinese people almost turned pale at the mention of flying. On December 14, I took the Hankou plane from Nanjing to Shanghai. There was only one passenger. The sky was mostly cloudy that day and the plane flew extremely high. The sea of clouds was vast and the sun shone. The plane flew thousands of feet above the clouds. It was truly a fairyland. The seas of clouds I saw in Kuanglu, Tianmu, and Laoshan mountains were not even a fraction of it. Seeing this, what is there to regret if I die? So I wrote this poem to encourage tourists (Yang Xingfo).</p>
<p>Wind and thunder send me into the blue sky, looking down I float as a light feather. Lowering my head, the world is really like a borrowed place, and I am still concerned about the Supreme Being. The clouds roll and the clouds break. Worries and hardships are like mountains. Death and life are cheap. The world and you have been abandoned for a long time. When will the nine heavens allow a long expedition?</p>
<h3>A Laugh from a Traveler</h3>
<p>A: I am a person who is afraid of death all my life. I don't know where I will die in the future.</p>
<p>B: Who knows where you will die?</p>
<p>A: If someone is willing to tell me, I am willing to send him a thousand dollars.</p>
<p>B: Why?</p>
<p>A: I can stay away from this place of death and avoid dying.</p>
<p>Old gentleman (to his servant): Boy, why do you always spill so much tea in the saucer when you bring me tea every morning?</p>
<p>Servant: Because I walk up the stairs quickly, it is inevitable that I will spill it.</p>
<p>Old gentleman: If you can not spill any tea tomorrow morning, I will reward you with two dimes.</p>
<p>Servant (the next day he brought tea to the old gentleman): Sir, look, isn't there no tea spilled in the saucer today?</p>
<p>Old gentleman: Good, I'll reward you with two dimes. Did you walk particularly slowly today?</p>
<p>Servant: No, I held the teacup in one hand and the saucer in the other.</p>
<p>Woman: Do you really love me to the extreme?</p>
<p>Man: Really to the extreme, there is no more love. Woman: Then would you be willing to die for me?</p>
<p>Man: Absolutely not. Once I die, my love will also die.</p>
<h3>Reading Painting Notes in a Hotel Run</h3>
<p>My old friend Zhang Zibai came from Xishan. I visited him at his hotel. During the conversation, Zibai knew that I liked painting, so he took out a long scroll of "Reading Painting in a Secluded Residence" from his suitcase and showed it to me. The scroll was made by my teacher Huang Zisu Yan at the request of Zibai as a gift to Cheng Zhang Yaosheng. The brush and ink are similar to the four Wangs. Zibai said that it directly approached Peng Xin. I felt that the vigorousness was even more than that. The five characters "Reading Painting in a Secluded Residence" on the scroll were inscribed by Qian Mingshan, a Jinshi from Piling. Zibai wrote after it: (Mr. Yaosheng is a painter and a naturalist. Since he abandoned his teaching position at Tsinghua University in the past, he has lived in seclusion by the sea and made a name for himself with painting. His works are magnificent and famous far and wide. Those who obtain them treasure every inch of paper, and the income from his inkstone field easily exchanges for hundreds of ancient paintings. He exhibits and plays with them every day and night, like a half-boat. It can be said that he has reached the extreme of art. However, people only know the skill of the teacher's painting, but do not know why it is so skillful. The teacher carefully studies and explores all the dissimilarities of all things in the universe, whether flying, hiding, moving, or plants, so that he can exhaust their traces and exhaust their changes. This is in line with the Confucian work of investigating things and obtaining knowledge. It is appropriate that his dragons and tigers, and small insects, are all lifelike and chaotic. It is his freedom that even nature is not as good as. Between the sizes, it is no different from a great cure in a great furnace. Li Changji's poem says that the pen makes up for the creation of heaven without merit. The teacher is enough to live up to it. Some people say that ancient Chinese painters often specialize in artistic charm and slightly trace the image. Those who study Western painting then rush to novelty and take sketching as their ability. They do not know</p>
<p>The artistic charm is to the point where the traces are naturally skillful, and the traces are to the point where they must also have brush and ink, then the theory of artistic charm will not be abandoned. It depends on whether one can obtain the truth. The teacher once drew a dragonfly. When a guest came to see it, he quickly covered it with his hand, fearing that it would fly away. He also drew an angry lion. When a child saw it, he cried and ran away. Those who asked spread it as a beautiful story. Although the ancient painting dragon broke the wall, how can it be added? However, the integration of the great achievements of the East and the West, the preservation of national quintessence, and the promotion of it, who is the teacher? I have been viewing Mr. Zhi's for a long time, and I have a close relationship with his talented disciple Huang Zisu Yan. Therefore, I begged Su Yu to make this picture as a gift, and I also wrote a few words to make those who read this painting know the source of Mr. Sheng's name, the difficulty of learning, and also know that Su Yu's painting has its own source, so it is not ordinary.) Zhuang Sizhen also wrote a poem: (Wearing a picture is like being close to Bishan, how can this body be sent outside the world? The unique learning of Yichuan is taught to Gongwang, and one day the clothes are passed down to two people.) His people and his paintings are enough to shake the chariot of the art garden and spread it to immortality.</p>
<h3>Shuanghong Studio Random Notes Wang Tianhen</h3>
<p>There is always a kind of woman who is easy to conceive and also easy to miscarry. No matter how careful and preventive she is, after four or five months of pregnancy, even if she avoids working and stays still, she will often miscarry spontaneously. There is a Chen woman in my hometown whose family is not wealthy and whose husband works as a carpenter. She is almost forty years old and has no children. She sincerely hopes for a child. In fact, the woman has been pregnant eight times. In the first two times, she still felt that the miscarriage was caused by labor and tremors. After this, she learned from her past mistakes and, after being pregnant, asked her mother-in-law to come to her home to help with chores. The woman did not leave the house. However, after four or five months, she still miscarried. After that, her mother-in-law died. When the woman was pregnant, she had to hire a maid to cook and wash clothes, and she did not do anything herself. It seemed that she could avoid it. However, she still could not keep even one pregnancy. The woman only felt an itch on her back and raised her hand to scratch it, and the fetus miscarried. Those who heard it thought it was strange.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes to Southeast Asia (105)</h3>
<p>There is a certain mountain near Mandalay that is said to be inhabited by several monks. I was in a hurry and did not get to go, which I regret very much. It is said that there are not only male monks but also female nuns. Sometimes the monks live upstairs and the nuns live downstairs. Mandalay is about two hours by car from Meimiao, a total of 48 miles. If you take the train, the third class is only a little over one yuan, and if you take the car, two or three people can sit together for two yuan per person. People say that when Zhuge Liang conquered X. he went to Meimiao and asked the locals how far it was from there to Mandalay, the Burmese capital. People answered that it was still one night's journey. Kongming mistakenly heard that it was still one month's journey, so he turned his car back north. Today, people call Meimiao Huilonggang. It is said that Kongming's failure to reach the Burmese capital has a lot to do with the development of Chinese power. It is a pity. Although the legends in various places like to cite Kongming's affairs as a topic of conversation, it is not necessarily a fact.</p>
<p>Mandalay's climate has less rain and is hotter than the climate in the north and south. Although Yangon is hot, it has more rain, so it is not dry. From Mandalay to Meimiao, it is more than a hundred miles, and the cold and heat are different. There is a student who was born in Meimiao. I asked him what school he was in. He replied that there is no higher education here. He used to go to school in Mandalay because he could not stand the heat, so he dropped out. It is as if there are two countries more than a hundred miles apart. Meimiao is located on a plateau with fertile scenery. Many Western gardens extend endlessly, which is larger than the Western residences in Shanghai. Red bananas, beautiful flowers, and green bamboos are planted, and they do not wither in all seasons. Meimiao is a good place, while Mandalay is not a good place. However, the dynasties have regarded it as the center of the city. Perhaps it is like the theory in our China that the place where the capital is built does not have to be good.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to investigate one thing reliably, but I will do my best. I think that Burma has English law and local Buddhism, so it should be able to enjoy peace. However, when I asked the locals, the young people have also been deteriorating day by day, and there have gradually been thieves. In a village not far from Mandalay, a wealthy family was suddenly attacked by a car one night. Two thieves killed the owner and plundered his property. It is said that the car came from a long distance. Burmese villages are like Japanese villages, with wooden houses and thatched roofs. In the past, they were naturally not worried because of a long period of peace. Now they are gradually becoming chaotic. If thieves attack, they have no resistance. Also, there is an English merchant in Mandalay who publicly sells arms. Anyone with a public document guarantee can go to the store to buy various large and small military weapons and even pistols for self-defense. Today, there are many kidnappings in mainland China because the arms and weapons are changing hands. One reason is that pistols are very expensive in mainland China, but they are very cheap to buy abroad and there is no way to prohibit it. There are also many ways to sell them, just like selling opium. Once, a friend bought a pistol that was mailed from the West. The method was to dig a hole in a thick, foreign-bound Old and New Testament to hold a small, three-inch-long pistol. Alas, the Bible, the Bible, the pistol is traveling in your name. How can Jesus do it? Today, the number of Western-style weapons in Burma is increasing day by day and they are cheap, which shows that compassionate culture is deteriorating day by day. I often talk to Burmese monks about it and vaguely worry about it, knowing that the future killing machine is not far away.</p>
<p>In addition to hiring a maid, a certain amount of fetus-preserving medicine was decocted and taken every few days. It can be said that she has exhausted all the efforts and precautions. As a craftsman's family, it is conceivable that they are eager for a child. I have been in Shanghai for several years and do not know if the woman has had a ninth pregnancy after eight miscarriages. There is also a neighbor in the east of my Shanghai residence who has the same disease as the woman. However, her husband works in the banking industry and has a very high monthly income, which is not comparable to that of a craftsman. However, the eagerness for a child is the same. The woman is well aware that she has been pregnant five times and has had miscarriages each time. This year, she is pregnant again, and it is about six or seven months. Because it is summer, although she has only been pregnant for four months, her abdomen feels swollen. When I asked her, she sadly said that she was worried that she would miscarry and dared not work. My roommate often heard me say that the Duli brand beef juice made by the German Mar pharmaceutical factory has various miraculous effects, which can increase sperm, benefit the body, strengthen muscles and bones, strengthen the body, and eliminate all diseases. Women who take it can unblock the meridians and invigorate blood, and pregnant women can preserve the fetus. So she asked the woman what kind of fetus-preserving medicine she had taken in the past. She said that she had asked famous doctors in her hometown to prescribe fetus-preserving medicine many times, but it was ineffective. This year, she hesitated and did not want to take it, but only drank bitter water. So she told her why not take the Lion brand beef juice. The woman asked, can beef juice also preserve the fetus? She said that she had heard of this theory. Since other medicines were ineffective, why not try it? The woman happily inquired about the place to buy it. My roommate is forgetful and could no longer remember it. She returned home and asked me, so she wrote on a piece of paper the Huada Pharmacy at 259 Fuxu Road and gave it to the woman to give to her husband. Her husband was skeptical, but he went to buy it and took it for more than a month. The fetus was finally stable and he began to believe in its effectiveness. So he continued to take it without stopping. Now he has given birth to a son and sent red eggs a few days ago. I did not believe that beef juice could preserve the fetus at first. At that time, I still thought that my roommate was meddling, but I did not expect it to be effective. Perhaps it was a coincidence? According to this juice, it was invented by the military during the European War. A certain commander of the German army was worried about the lack of food, so he made this juice. Each person had a bottle. When there was a lack of food, he could take it without being hungry. After the war, it became a commodity and became famous all over the world.</p>

<p>Episode 16: Earnest Inquiries and Word Requests, Green Sleeves Visit the Teacher; Generous Discussions of Military Matters, Talented Women Feast in Brothels</p>
<p>From then on, Zuo Shichen devoted himself to old newspapers and documents in the editorial department. He often heard the ringing of the telephone on the wall. Zuo Shichen would quickly pick up the receiver, only to hear "Small Garden," knowing it was Luyi calling. However, the calls were always about trivial matters, asking if he had eaten dinner, what time he would finish work, and whether he would come over that day. These insignificant questions continued incessantly, and the other colleagues in the editorial department also knew about their relationship. Whenever they heard a female voice on the phone, they would immediately hand the receiver to Zuo Shichen with a mocking attitude, saying, "Mr. Zuo, it's the Small Garden calling again." Sometimes, even Shi Guanping received calls from the Small Garden. Therefore, he had two poems about telephone calls: "Flying from beyond the heavens, tender and sweet intentions; expressing all the roundabout hearts of the world." This was referring to women making phone calls. Later, a fashionable stationery for women was created, depicting various poses of women talking on the phone, with these two lines written on the drawings. Initially, Zuo Shichen thought there was truly something important when he received calls from Luyi and would go to her place. Later, he realized there was nothing important, and the phone calls were just about whether he would come or not, without discussing anything else. Therefore, he visited the Small Garden more frequently than before, often going alone. The business at Luyi's room was very quiet, and there were few patrons even for simple tea service. Luyi would call Zuo Shichen when she was truly too idle and bored. However, Zuo Shichen was a busy man, sometimes coming and sometimes not. One day, after dinner around ten o'clock, Zuo Shichen went to the Small Garden and found Luyi extremely bored, using thirty-two ivory tiles under the lamplight in the pavilion to play "Five Passes." She had truly mastered the game, like people say there are three "to's" in studying: heart to, eye to, hand to. Others might be slow and take a long time to see, but she would only glance once, her fair wrists moving up and down, never making a mistake. A senior maid in the room, called A'gen, saw Zuo Shichen and said, "A'nan, stop playing Five Passes. Let's play Connect Four with the Second Master." Luyi's mother laughed, "Really, getting angry over playing Five Passes? If you can get through, you get through; if you can't, you can't. Is it worth getting upset?" Zuo Shichen asked what was wrong. A'gen said, "Because A'nan can't get through in Five Passes, she's getting angry." Luyi said, "It must be my luck. I've played seventeen sets in a row today and I'm destined not to get through. Even if I play until dawn, I'll still try to get through!" Zuo Shichen said, "You're being stubborn again. Let's play Connect Four, whether two or three of us. Or we can play Tianjiu, or even better, Diao Ba Jiu." Luyi said, "Let me play three more sets. If I can't get through in three sets, then I'll never get through today..."</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<p>Gold Speculation Mania Continues</p>
<p>New Records Continuously Discovered</p>
<p>Significant Changes Occurred Frequently. Yesterday, December 19th, the price of gold frequently reached new peaks, exceeding the major milestone of 670 taels. The surge in prices was fierce and unstoppable, like a wild elephant. Fluctuations of four or five taels occurred frequently, making it difficult to predict. The madness was extremely frightening. As for foreign exchange, it recovered but then weakened, with the listed price narrowing by one notch, a clear sign of tight conditions turning into hidden ease. Some traders continued to sell in the market, but the psychology of major players differed. Zifeng, Yongyongheng, Chenfengyong, and settlement companies were all buying, while Yuanmaoyong, Yongheng, and Wu were selling. There were many short-covering activities, possibly due to the lower trend in overseas silver markets and continued exports from the United States. Therefore, the gold price opened high. However, in the morning session, there was a fluctuation of eight taels. The price first rose and then fell. Rumors circulated that cash could be exported, and a certain bank was preparing to ship it. The news spread, and people became excited, with buyers becoming enthusiastic. A new record of 671 taels was reached. However, those who were prepared were quick to sell, and the price slightly declined, retreating within 70 taels. The market became even more chaotic, with the price fluctuating by six taels. The situation was extremely diverse and difficult to manage. The exchange rate loosened, and buying activity was lively. Later, the market suddenly weakened and fell to within 63 taels. It is rumored that the price of large bars will rise again this morning.</p>
<p>Another astonishing record appeared. In the morning session, the February gold price opened with an increase of 3 taels and 2 mace, reaching 664 taels (the gross price ranged from 67 taels to 4 taels due to the activity of settlement companies). Large bars had fallen by 3/16, forward contracts by 1/8, and the silver price fell by 6/8. Private telegrams showed a decrease of 11/16. Subsequently, Zifeng, Yongtai, Kangrun, and Fuchang sold, and the price jumped by 4 taels, reaching 68 taels. The price of British gold also rose, with HSBC and the Bank of East Asia increasing to 1 shilling and 5 pence in December. Then, Hefeng increased to the same price in January, but when the price opened at a shilling, it had already returned to 66 taels and 5 mace. Although Dalian Gang was selling and the listed price narrowed by 25 US cents and 5 US dollars, and the Japanese gold price increased by 2 cents, it was not affected. Afterwards, the price fell slightly to 65 taels and 7 or 8 mace, then rose by more than 1 tael. Yuanmaoyong, Xinxing, and Dadecheng tended to sell, and the shilling also loosened. The March Sumitomo bought at 1.51875, and Mitsui bought at 1.525. Therefore, the market situation suddenly turned weak and plummeted by 4 or 5 taels. At 10:20 AM, the price reached 63 taels. Afterwards, Yongfeng, Yongheng, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Yuancheng, and Dadecheng rushed to buy, and because Korea was absorbing the March British gold at 1.51875, the price reached 67 taels and 7 or 8 mace at 10:45 AM. Goods and retail customers sold, and the price was reduced by a small 2 taels. At 11:00 AM, news spread that the Chase Bank would ship cash, and the market situation greatly improved, suddenly breaking through the 70-tael mark. After 11:30 AM, the price reached 71 taels, but British gold did not tighten further. Yuancheng, Yongxing, and Heng took the opportunity to sell, and the price suddenly fell by more than 2 taels. The market closed at noon at 68 taels and 6 mace, with occasional fluctuations of 1 tael. Afterwards, the price fell again to around 6 taels, mainly because Xinxing continued to sell, and the asking price was changed to 700 taels and 0.002 mace. The Japanese gold price increased by a large 2 cents, initially planned at 33-34 taels, then 36-37 taels, and at noon, around 30 taels.</p>
<p>Hidden Weakness Before Market Close. The market opened at 68 taels (gross price ranged from 6 taels to 8 taels). Subsequently, the price dropped by 2 taels due to the Indian exchange rate rising by 1 anna. Then, it increased from 6 taels to 8.5 taels. Dalian Gang bought, and then suddenly sold, along with Yuanmaoyong and various companies selling. The market turned from strong to weak, and dropped to 63 taels at 3:00 PM. Mitsui appeared, with Dalian at 1 tael, 4 mace, 2 cents, and 875 li. Sumitomo entered the January British gold at 1.525. Afterwards, Xieyu and others rushed to buy. News spread that the Indian exchange rate was rebounding sharply, adding 6 taels at 3:30 PM, reaching 69 taels. Suddenly, Dalian Gang entered the market to sell, followed by Yuanmaoyong, Taikangrun, goods, etc., who successively sold. The British gold also turned hard, and the situation suddenly became weak, falling sharply to only 62 taels and 3 mace at 4:20 PM. This was due to people's instability and lack of opinions, drifting with the waves. At 4:30 PM, the market closed at 63 taels and 3 mace, an increase of 2 and a half taels compared to the previous day. Afterwards, the price rose to 64 taels, then retreated to within 63 taels. The maximum fluctuation during the day was 71 taels, and the minimum was 62 taels and 3 mace, a difference of 8 taels and 7 mace. The morning price of goods was 64 taels and 3 mace, the noon price was 8 taels, and the afternoon closing price was 2 taels and 8 mace. The listed price was reduced by 32-33 taels to 36-37 taels.</p>
<p>Speculators Bought and Sold. Dealers' transactions were complex. Zifeng, Yongyongheng, Fuchang, Yuancheng, Dadecheng, Yuanheng, Chenfengyong, Fuxingyongyu, Datatxing, Taikangrunrunchangyu all bought. The Luo brothers, speculators, bought and sold differently. Shunliwanxing, Xinxing, Bingxing, and Yuanmaoyong all sold. It was rumored that Mr. Wu sold more than 1,000 short contracts. Yuanta, Yuancheng, and Yong bought and sold differently. Goods were bought and sold frequently in large quantities, but they were for settlement purposes. Shilling settlement companies were all buying. In the afternoon, Yuanxingyong, Shunliwanxing, Hongli, Hengxing, Xieyu, and Yufengyong all bought. Taikangrunyu, Dafuxingyong, and goods all sold. Dalian Gang first sold and then bought, buying a total of 3,800 contracts and selling more than 4,000 contracts. Guangbang bought 1,000 contracts for British gold settlement.</p>
<h3>Discrepancies Between Visible and Hidden Foreign Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Settlement Companies Approaching, Chinese Businesses Selling</p>
<p>Yesterday, British, American, Indian, and silver markets were all low, but exchange rates rose. The United States sold silver bullion, and the market was weak. HSBC's listed foreign exchange rates also narrowed by one notch. However, the domestic market was tight and then loosened, which was unexpected. British gold narrowed by 25, equivalent to 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 875 li. The American half dollar was equivalent to 34 yuan and 125 li. The Indian 1 yuan and 25 was equivalent to 94 rupees and 75. The French 13 yuan was equivalent to 869 yuan. The German 2 yuan and 25 was equivalent to 143 marks. The He Yang shrunk by 1 yuan and 25, equivalent to 84 taels and 75. Hong Kong added 5 qian, equivalent to 78 taels and 5 qian. Po Hui added 2 taels and 25, equivalent to 164 taels and 75. The Japanese gold price increased by 2 cents, reaching 1 tael, 4 qian, 5 fen, and 25 li. This was the price for bank transactions, which differed. The situation was clearly tight and secretly loose. The gold market had repeatedly reached new milestones, reaching 671 taels. However, sellers were enthusiastic and the market went downstream. There were extreme ups and downs throughout the day, fluctuating by more than 8 taels, and finally rose slightly. However, the closing prices of various exchange rates were lower than the previous day. British gold increased by 125, American dollars added 3125, and Japanese gold decreased by 1 cent and 25. The settlement companies were gradually approaching, with British gold accounting for about 10 taels. Chinese businesses had occupied many long positions, so they suffered losses. Yesterday, the gold industry sold about 200,000 British gold to settle forward contracts. Banks had a strong appetite. Dutch, Bank of East Asia, Sumitomo, Mitsui, Zhengjin, and Korea all bought, and various banks exchanged with each other. HSBC also absorbed some, and also made 100,000 to 200,000 US dollars. Chinese businesses sold 200,000 yuan. Maihang, Mitsui, and Sumitomo all bought. The Japanese gold Dalian Gang purchased over 1 million yuan, and Japanese commercial banks sold. The market situation was the opposite of the gold market. It is said that the silver in large bars will grow this morning.</p>

<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton Re-enter a Tired Path</h3>

Initially, it was firm due to short covering, but later it became tired due to reactive selling. Futures fell by 12 to 20 pound sounds, and spot prices fell by 15 pound sounds. British cotton futures rose by 16 to 17 points, and spot prices rose by 17 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 25 points.

<h3>Estimated Private Ginning of American Cotton</h3>

<p>Grain and Rice Market Fluctuations in Southern Rivers: Morning Weakness, Afternoon Strength</p>
<p>Yesterday, over thirty grain dealers from various regions in Zhabei had a good sales performance in the morning. Initially, the market appeared slightly soft, but continuous rainfall prompted a change in sentiment, leading to a tightening market. Top-grade rice still opened at $14.10, with no rise in the larger market except for thin rice shipments, which also saw brisk sales and price increases of nearly ten cents. Yangxian rice, after an initial lull, slightly recovered due to sales activity, showing a profit of half a foot. Duxian rice from the river was continuously arriving, with top-grade goods finding a particularly strong market. Currently, top-grade rice opens at $12.89. Shipments of local rice remained stable in both sales and price, fluctuating slightly. Inferior rice also showed no significant gains or losses, opening high at $11.70. Overall, trading volume was low across the board.</p>
<p>In South Shanghai, approximately ten shipments arrived from the river yesterday, with satisfactory sales. High-grade Japonica rice from Changzhou and Sutong White Japonica rice were scarce, and sales were sluggish due to the rain. However, prices were steady due to stabilizing market sentiment. In South Shanghai, there was strong demand for thin early rice, with diminishing river stocks and firm prices. Both Yang Duxian rice varieties were stable. Demand for smaller quantities was not weak, with top-grade opening at $12. Inferior rice lacked high demand, with stable sales for regular goods. Inferior rice showed a dull trend with limited trading. Both markets experienced diminished sales due to the light rain.</p>
<h3>Gradual Strengthening of the Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, all months in the flour market showed signs of stability. While the quoted price of imported wheat only increased slightly by one or two cents, the foreign exchange rate rose sharply due to high premiums, making the exchange rate increasingly unfavorable. Therefore, despite the small increase in imported wheat prices, they became increasingly uneconomical, leading to tightening market sentiment. Furthermore, with the Lunar New Year approaching, factories have largely ceased trading, and outside speculators are also seeking to close their positions as the market stabilizes. As a result, prices for near and distant months have been gradually increasing. Consequently, this month's price is up 1.25 cents from the previous day, February is up 0.5 cents, March and May are up 1.25 cents each, and April is up 4 cents.</p>
<h3>Grain Market Reverses to an Upward Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the grain market initially saw flat sentiment due to a slight increase in the price of imported wheat. However, in the afternoon, prices rose as the exchange rate remained high, forcing speculators with short positions in imported wheat to temporarily cover their positions. Moreover, the flour market was also brisk, shifting outside sentiment. As a result, whenever the market dipped, increased demand easily strengthened prices. This month's price showed stability due to a slight increase in long positions. January rose 5 cents, February rose 6 cents, March and April rose 6 cents, and May rose 7 cents. The current grain market is inactive as factories have not yet started operating.</p>
<h3>Local and Distant Merchants are Heavily Restocking Piece Goods</h3>
<p>The piece goods trade is flourishing, largely because the issue of the Western calendar year-end settlement has been resolved. Market sentiment has revived, and local merchants are actively restocking to prepare for wholesale distribution inland. Merchants from Qingdao and Tianjin, in particular, are increasing their purchases in Shanghai due to the sharp rise in the Eastern exchange rate. Yesterday, there were large transactions in tribute broadcloth and fine serge, leading to gradual price increases. San You Tu tribute satin has become extremely scarce, selling for 3.65 cents. Ba Jun Tu is selling for 3.6 cents, Di Yi Gong tribute satin for 3.2 cents, Que Qiao Hui for 2.775 cents, Qi Bao Zhu for 2.75 cents, and Chang Cheng Qi Ma for 2.725 cents. Fine serge, Bao Qiu, and Gu Cheng Hui are also in short supply, with the number of mid-range goods increasing daily. Hu Xin Ting remains at 3.025 cents, and Jin Shan Si and Zi Jin Shan are both at 2.975 cents, with Er You Tu at the same price. Jiao Ye Ti Shu is at 2.9 cents, while Yue Hua velvet is slightly sluggish. Printed velvet is selling very well, with cuts selling for 1.65 to 1.7 cents. Western foot-and-a-half velvet is becoming increasingly scarce. There is strong demand for bleached cloth, with approximately 150 pieces being transferred yesterday, according to reports.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Tianjin Peach Kernels See Astonishing Land Price</h3>
<p>Recently, Tianjin peach kernels have experienced a continuous rise in land prices, leading to a shortage of supply. According to recent correspondence, the stock in Tianjin is extremely scarce, with the purchase price rising to 100 yuan, which translates to 80 taels when converted into Shanghai currency, a significant difference from the local market price. Therefore, no further shipments are expected in the near future. Yesterday, boxed Tianjin peach kernels sold for 50 taels, and dried Tianjin peaches sold for 45 taels.</p>
<h3>Raw Sugar Market Opens with a 2-Cent Drop</h3>
<p>Raw Sugar Market Opens with a 2-Cent Drop</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received news from the production areas indicating that the current price of Cuban sugar remained unchanged. New York futures saw a decrease of 2 cents for December and 1 cent for March, while September remained at 1.55. Java's current futures prices also saw no increase or decrease. Initially, the market was buoyed by the rising exchange rate, leading to higher bids in the public market. However, buyers were quiet and inquiries were scarce, resulting in a slightly stagnant market. Dutch sugar No. 34 coarse-grain white sugar was quoted at 8 taels and 5.5 cents for high-grade and 7 taels and 5 cents for ordinary, but demand was weak. Later, a small transaction of 8 taels and 5 cents occurred, leading to a flat and sluggish market. Fine-grain white sugar was priced at 7 taels and 6 cents, and No. 20 medium-grain white sugar was priced at 7 taels and 7 cents, but the market was unremarkable. Japanese sugar saw even slower activity, with YR mark at 8 taels and 5 cents, YP mark at 9 taels, and YRO mark at 8 taels. Meiji goods saw slightly higher bids but received few takers, while TY mark was at 8 taels and 6 cents, keeping the market flat. Taikoo Sugar P mark (ready for shipment) saw strong interest from merchants, with 3,500 bags quoted at 5 taels and 4.5 cents. The newly taxed H mark was priced at 6 taels and 1 cent, but there were no inquiries. Hua Xin Hao offered 1,000 bags of raw red sugar at 7 taels and 6 cents, with the market showing no movement. Desheng Hao offered 200 bags of the original Bingcha Qing at 7 taels and 7 cents. Newly arrived domestic raw sugar continued to be offered, with over 200 bags quoted at 7 taels for high-grade and 7 taels and 1 cent for superior goods, a slight decrease of 2 cents compared to previous offers, but still considered brisk, according to reports.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: High-Grade Zhenmei Tea from Gaozhuang Sees Slight Movement in British Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai saw the British merchants reopen trading in high-grade Zhenmei green tea from Yuan Tunxi and other areas, particularly from the Tianxiang Foreign Firm. However, due to low bids relayed from abroad, many negotiations failed to reach an agreement. British and Indian merchants made scattered purchases of mid- to low-grade goods, but the selling price remained low. Needle and Xiu Mei teas saw relatively active trading. Top-grade Gongxi from Yuan Dong Road was offered at 90 taels, but trading in mid- to low-grade goods remained suspended due to the continued closure of Russian merchants.</p>

<p>Youth Garden</p>
<p>My Nightly Rinse (英)</p>
<p>In Memory of Mr. Su Duyu</p>
<p>Two months ago, I wrote a short essay titled (Night), published in the Youth Garden section of Shen Bao. Mr. Su Duyu read the piece, empathized with it, and wrote a letter asking me for my address. Mr. Su and I lived near each other, and we may have even met on the road, but I had long lived in seclusion, cut off from social interaction. Although I saw Mr. Su's sincere letter, I hesitated to reply, thinking that I was not worthy of association. Less than two weeks later, Mr. Su died of illness at a very young age, at the height of his life. His classmates held a memorial service for him. I wanted to go and pay my respects, to see the face of that unfamiliar friend one last time, but ultimately feared it would seem too abrupt and didn't dare go. Now, another month has passed since his death, and Mr. Su's matter is always on my mind. An unfamiliar friend has made me deeply attached. Life is always like this, an inexplicable human relationship, like walking in the fog, only seeing a small dot in the vast universe. Sometimes, you see someone coming, emerging from the fog, gradually becoming clearer until you can see their face when they pass you by. Then, they gradually disappear back into the fog. It is this brief moment that makes people persistent and unforgettable. Therefore, it is not entirely inappropriate for me to write this humble piece in memory of Mr. Su.</p>
<p>The (Night) I wrote last time originally had a second part, but I ran out of inspiration and couldn't continue. I am someone busy with life, and I have no leisure or inclination to appreciate all the leisurely pleasures. For ten years, I have been running around, never getting a moment to rest. Although I am not very old, the hardships of life are deeply etched on my forehead. No one who meets me can guess my real age. Although I should still be young, I no longer have the mentality of a youth. However, I am ultimately from the countryside. No matter how long I wander in the city, this prosperous and luxurious life is always unfamiliar to me, and I dream of those distant things. Because I have to make a living, I cannot help but roam Shanghai, but I still secretly hide in a place far from the city. This is why I wrote that piece.</p>
<p>In the countryside, what makes people feel the passage of time and the growth of life most is the clear manifestation of spring, autumn, or the desolate winter, imprinted on the fields, on the scenery, and on the color of the sky. Wild grass and leaves speak to you in a light and agile language about their experiences, sometimes gentle and charming, sometimes quietly sighing. Early risers brave the cold summer and experience dew, and in autumn and winter, they endure severe frost. Everything your eyes touch and your feet step on will merge into those currents of life. A blade of grass, a wild flower, a grain of sand, all unfold their hearts to embrace you, but you must receive all this with an empty heart. Only with an empty heart can you feel the life of the universe.</p>
<p>The changing seasons may seem too monotonous in the eyes of the everlasting spirit of life, but our lives are only a short few decades and will never tire of them. This is too much stillness. Observing their past and exploring their messages is also a way to increase our lives. In the city, everything changes too quickly, and in another sense, it lacks permanence and stillness. Unless you see people on the street changing into new clothes, who can know that the seasons have secretly changed? Then go ask the birds, ask the wild grass, they will tell you. From late spring to February, new bamboo shoots grow everywhere, forming forests. Just a few days later, those precarious and independent young things have grown branches and leaves. They have all reached youth and are telling you the news of early summer. The transitions between spring and summer and autumn and winter are times of drastic change in nature. A change in the wind overnight can make people feel that the fields are no longer the same.</p>
<p>Once, I was alone in the garden, looking at the large cabbages. They were definitely not something from a vegetable stall or a chef's hand. What stood before me were creatures radiating rich life. I was amazed at their strangeness. Some of the very large leaves spread out in all directions, like a hen spreading its wings to let chicks hide underneath. The leaves inside were rolled up one by one, rolled up very tightly, as if hiding some deep and distant thoughts, not letting others know. I suddenly had a fantasy, wanting to peek into the secrets hidden in those deep hearts. So I reached out to gently open a rolled-up leaf. That leaf rejected me with such a gentle yet stern expression. The cold dew conveyed a chilly feeling to my fingers, making me immediately ashamed of doing something I shouldn't have done. My heart trembled deeply, as if I had secretly peeked into the heart of a lover.</p>
<p>Originally, I was used to wandering outside, and there was nothing involved in my hometown. There was no one I cared about, and no one cared about me. I never thought about what my hometown was like, but this year, I suddenly began to miss the scenery of my hometown. However, upon careful reflection, it was just that my longing for the fields was more intense. What I missed most was the wild land, with so many flowers. The north certainly didn't have them, and even the scenery of Jiangnan was far inferior in splendor. In spring, wild roses and wild chrysanthemums bloomed everywhere, covering the roadsides and fences. It was not only lush and beautiful, but also fragrant. Purple cloud clover covered the entire field ridge. If a monarch laid a ten-mile carpet of purple in the plain, he would still lose to these little purple cloud clover. The mountains were constantly filled with the fragrance of orchids, and the red azaleas bloomed so much that the mountainside could not be seen. In the countryside, its name is yingshanhong (映山红). But what evokes the most reverie is sitting alone in an orange and pomelo orchard on a moonlit night in March. Don't move, don't think, let the moonlight flow like water through your chest. The small white flowers of the orange and pomelo, which made the whole tree appear white, would constantly fall on you, weaving you a fragrant and pure white garment. In the distance, there was the quiet sound of a waterwheel, like the whispers of lovers. All of this made you intoxicated, made you feel like you were sinking into a dream.</p>
<p>But now I am in a place where the northwest wind blows and sand covers the ground. The fields are withered, and everything is dead. Only far away can I see the many smokestacks of Shanghai emitting black and strange patterns. At night, the red lights on the roof of the Sincere Company seemed to be leering at me. And I am toiling in life, with no time to dream.</p>
<p>I wanted to write another (Night), those beautiful and quiet things, although pale, are very lovely, to comfort the spirits of the dead. But my single bed can no longer produce such things. My night is desolate and chaotic. Only occasionally do I look up and see some of the night light outside the window. I also want to put down my pen and run out to see the moonlight and the frost all over the ground. But my heart is tight, and I have none of this leisure or feeling left. I think Mr. Su ultimately didn't see my piece, perhaps leaving him with a slightly good impression to take into the eternal night. If he came one day and sat opposite me in my night, he would probably leave with some disillusioned feelings.</p>
<p>Life constantly pushes me forward. I know that this little bit of memory for an unfamiliar friend will soon disappear. Perhaps this piece of writing will accidentally be seen by someone unrelated on the paper wrapping peanuts or some small object, and it will evoke a slight melancholy in them. Then the dead who sleep forever, me, and that stranger will have some involvement in life.</p>
<p>Now I should put down my pen and do something else. On the journey, Yan Wen.</p>
<p>Diary of a Visit, Page One</p>
<p>The visit, which had been prepared for two weeks, finally set off today. Now I am starting to write my diary of the visit at the Capital Jinling University.</p>
<p>Last night I was still sleeping in Jiangwan, but tonight I will be sleeping here. If people have convenient transportation, their fate will surely be like birds, drifting east and west.</p>
<p>I was woken up by my classmates at a little after four o'clock in the morning. The sky was still pitch black. After washing my face and eating breakfast, I heard the wake-up bell. This must be the first time this semester that I have heard the wake-up bell. I smiled slightly when I thought of my past habit of sleeping in because there were no classes at one or two o'clock.</p>
<p>But today I heard the wake-up bell.</p>
<p>When we set off from school, the sky was just beginning to brighten. A truck carried us along the early morning streets. The air was so fresh. I sat in the front of the car, where the driver sat, watching the city, just awakening from its sleep, still shrouded in a thin mist. My heart felt wider than ever before. The car struggled to break through the thin mist and move forward. The clock tower of our school finally gradually disappeared, disappearing into the vast, blurry, and thin mist, bidding us farewell for a short time.</p>
<p>At a little after seven o'clock, the train slowly started moving. The great city, the Venice of the East, the place of sin, gradually opened up to us, and we said goodbye to it for a while. At this time, the sky was mercilessly drizzling. Looking out from the train window, the fields of early winter, although pitifully desolate, at least looked fresh to me, who had grown tired of city life. There were patches of straw dotted here and there, and there were farmers working in the drizzle. There was everything that could not be seen in the city.</p>
<p>Because of the rain, everyone was worried.</p>
<p>Sitting in the car was very boring. I opened the August issue of the novel magazine I had brought and looked at Pu Nianlao's "Leopard Head Lin Chong," Wan Man's "The Meaning of Freedom," and Huang Zhongsu's "Blood." It is said that Pu Nianlao is Mao Dun. Although his "Leopard Head Lin Chong" has good writing techniques, isn't it too boring to find some material in old novels to write an article? Moreover, the whole piece has no structure. I think this can only be called an essay. I don't even know what Wan Man's "The Meaning of Freedom" is about. I don't believe that such writing would be published in a novel magazine. Huang Zhongsu's "Blood" has a good structure, but it is just a love story. I don't know what use it has for the country or for society, what contribution it makes. Is the novel magazine really unwilling to stand on its own?</p>
<p>I didn't want to read any further and provoke my unnecessary feelings. I went and threw down the novel magazine, but boredom occupied my heart again.</p>
<p>I turned my head to the window. The distant mountains and forests seemed to be rotating around us. The nearby farmers all stopped working and looked at the monster carrying us forward. But the drizzle in the sky had not stopped.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Ju San and Rui Bai were traveling with us. Ju San still had a very childish air about him. He would often make funny expressions and faces to make people laugh. Rui Bai's air of amusement also often made us happy. This time, with the two of them together, there were even more funny things. Rui Bai told stories, and Ju San sang the ILOVEYOU song from "Xuangong Yanshi," filling our carriage with laughter. Laughter dispelled our boredom and gradually passed through this long journey.</p>
<p>When we passed Zhenjiang, it was a little after two o'clock. Beigushan and Jinshan appeared before my eyes again. Zhenjiang is considered my second hometown. I lived in Zhenjiang for five years. I spent my precious childhood in Zhenjiang. When the train entered Zhenjiang Station, my mind was filled with images of my childhood. Ah, not far from Beigushan is my alma mater, Zhenzhong. In the past, we often secretly climbed down the city wall to visit Beigushan. Not far from the South Gate was my residence at that time. Whenever it was Sunday, my father, brother, and I would often stroll out of the city gate and chat on the tender grass. Ah, all the past events replayed in my mind like a revolving lantern. But now, my father has parted with us forever, and my childhood years have long passed gently and cannot be retained. Alas, thinking of the past makes me even more melancholic. I was deeply immersed in my memories, and I felt even more melancholic.</p>
<p>I leaned against the train window alone, looking at everything at the station, as if those were enough to comfort my melancholy, enough to commemorate my deceased father and my vanished childhood years. But the train was moving again. Everything at Zhenjiang Station was leaving my sight. I have been away from the beautiful Zhenjiang, with its mountains and rivers, for three years. I don't know when I will be able to return to its embrace. Even if I have such a day, I will be able to return to her embrace and receive her gentle nurturing again, but my youth has already passed away and cannot be reversed. Even if my youth could be reversed, even if time could flow backward and childhood could return, I have no way to find my loving father again.</p>
<p>Melancholy, troubled, I am melancholic, I am even more troubled, even now as I write this diary.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Nanjing, it was already four o'clock. After taking a small, crawling train into the city, we arrived at Jinling University at a little after six o'clock. The students at Jinling University were very hospitable to us. We felt very grateful in our hearts and couldn't help but think of the fact that Zhongda, also a national university, had refused to let us stay there.</p>
<p>We ate dinner at a restaurant in the evening. Because we hadn't eaten all day, we were extremely hungry and unknowingly ate five small bowls of rice. When we returned to Jinling University, it was raining again. How annoying.</p>
<p>Qianman from the Sea</p>
<p>A Lonely Boat</p>
<p>Drifting in the mouth of the Wusong River, the west wind blows tightly,</p>
<p>Making me tremble with fear.</p>
<p>People despise it, saying it is</p>
<p>A lowly matter, the profession of fisherman.</p>
<p>Alas, the ravings of a dream!</p>
<p>Do they even know why the enemy to the east is so strong?</p>
<p>It is a true fact that the Chinese people generally hold the aquatic industry in contempt. When it comes to advocating and promoting it, there are even fewer words. But the news of the mistresses in the Eastern and Western Palaces often has their scandalous deeds in the newspapers. Is there really no value in talking about the aquatic life?</p>
<p>That vast sky is green and boundless. The howling wind blows the light and fast white clouds only in the southeast, northwest, and constantly fluttering. On the other side is a white and vast ocean, very deep and very broad. These strong waves constantly rise and fall, entangling and unrestrainedly running and jumping. What a great Wusong River! Here, there are also gardens with towering pines and cypresses and lush flowers and trees. The huge sports ground is also enough for the athletes to show off their skills. Our school, the Fisheries School, is located on this vast and open Song River, towering slightly.</p>
<p>The aquatic life is fulfilling and rich, not dry and tasteless. It emphasizes practice and does not specialize in empty talk. In addition to our regular classes, we have opportunities to practice at certain scheduled times with the fishing and manufacturing departments.</p>
<p>Every morning in spring and autumn, the students become active. The students in the fishing department, equipped with equipment for practical fishing, leave by car as usual. The rest of them operate boats or make cans, each according to their nature and doing their own thing. The hardest work is twisting ropes. Each time we twist a rope with a diameter of three or four inches, a thick rope used to tie anchors, we must sweat profusely to make it firm. It is okay to do this kind of work in the winter. In the spring and autumn, it is even harder. Looking at the degree to which they sweat, you know that it is ten times hotter than the hot summer. But they really have an indomitable spirit. Although their hands are deeply red, blistered, and broken, they still work tirelessly and continue to twist.</p>
<p>Making canned food is also very interesting, because we have a hope that exists: to eat what we make. When allocating the food materials, the factory is hot and crowded with people, and the voices are noisy. Coupled with the sound of the machines, it is even more chaotic. So it is often easy to accidentally mis-throw the seasoning when you are slightly rough. It's really not an easy thing.</p>
<p>When the students returning from their fishing practice are full of their catch, the students are all beaming with joy, because they can feast on fish and meat to satisfy our hunger and fill our stomachs. Of course, this is happy for us, but the cooks have to be busy all day long. However, such things are rare. I am afraid that there may not be one such event in one semester.</p>
<p>The aquatic life is roughly like this. To be honest, our kind of production life is lively, meaningful, and hopeful. As long as there are no more political changes and it is gradually driven into orbit, we are not afraid of chasing strong enemies overseas and revitalizing our national power in East Asia.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Having read the section on a female student who dropped out halfway in the Youth Garden column of your newspaper, it has been determined that there is no such person as Gu Dafang among the current and former female students of our school. A letter is hereby sent to clarify the matter, hoping that this letter will be published in its original column in order to avoid misunderstandings. Respectfully, Anxia University, December 16th.</p>
