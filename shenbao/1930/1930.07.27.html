<p>推此次英國派遺遠東商業考察團之意以爲英國商業之衰落關於遠東者甚大而遠東之中國尤爲其關係中之最注意故其考察之時間淹留中國者須有三個月之久而其間最要之部分則又以棉織業爲主蓋以前中國棉織物之進口以英國爲主近年以來多爲日商所侵奪早已一年不如一年今英人始有所覺悟乃於考察中國之前先至日本考察蓋來中國所以考察商業衰落之原由其往日本所以考察商業如何爲其所侵奪之原由也此乃英國此次派遣遠東商業考察團之命意也</p>
<p>殊不知此爲數年前之情形非今日之情形也今日英國商業之衰落非僅由於遠東之一隅更非由於爲日本侵奪之故亦非由於因中國内戰之故蓋以中國即無内戰所銷亦必有限日本今日商業之衰落與英亦復相埒是略知今日中國商業狀况者皆能知也金貴銀賤爲今日表面之近因工業國之競爭過烈出貨過多而無法消納爲今後根本之遠因是兩者而無法救濟無論若何考察余以爲終無所補也</p>

<h3 id="e21">Re-discussing the British Far East Commercial Inspection Group <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>It is believed that the intention of this British delegation for a commercial investigation in the Far East is due to the substantial decline of British commerce in the Far East, with China being the most critical area. Therefore, their investigation will last for three months in China, with the most important part focusing on the cotton textile industry. In the past, the United Kingdom was the primary source of imported cotton textiles to China. However, in recent years, Japanese merchants have encroached upon this market, resulting in a year-on-year decline. Now, the British have realized this and are investigating Japan before coming to China. They are coming to China to investigate the reasons for the decline in commerce and going to Japan to investigate how they encroached upon it. This is the mission of the British delegation for commercial investigation in the Far East.</p>
<p>However, this was the situation several years ago, not today. The decline of British commerce today is not only due to one corner of the Far East, nor due to encroachment by Japan, nor due to internal wars in China. Even if there were no internal wars in China, the sales would still be limited. The decline of Japanese commerce today is comparable to that of the United Kingdom. Anyone with a slight understanding of the current state of Chinese commerce knows this. The high price of gold and low price of silver are the superficial and immediate causes. The excessive competition and overproduction of industrial countries, with no way to absorb the goods, are the fundamental and long-term causes. If these two cannot be remedied, no matter how much investigation is conducted, I believe it will ultimately be futile.</p>

<p>Nanjing: The National Bond Maintenance Association previously telegraphed the National Government and the Ministry of Finance, stating that bond prices had plummeted, creating a dangerous situation, and requested that measures be taken to maintain them and proposed four remedial methods: 1. Order the securities exchange to require those selling futures to provide cash as collateral; 2. Request that the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China discount the principal and interest coupons of government bonds; 3. Request the announcement of the actual situation of the government bond fund; 4. Request the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China not to refuse the mortgage of bonds for demobilization and disbandment to maintain the credit of national government bonds. According to news from the Ministry of Finance, the government bond fund issued by the Ministry is completely independent and managed by the Fund Management Committee. Price fluctuations are temporary market relations. When the 6% and 7% long-term government bonds suddenly fell to 35 yuan in the 16th year of the Republic, they have now rebounded to 70 yuan. This time, the decline was related to the gold rush and was inevitably affected by the current situation. However, speculators are accustomed to manipulating short and long positions, and the supply and demand of the market have a gradual downward trend. The Ministry of Finance is deeply studying the association's suggestions. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>Underground Rumblings Continue</p>
<p>Terror Increases Among Victims</p>
<p>Rome, July 25 (National News Agency) – Another relatively weak earthquake struck the disaster areas of southern Italy today. Rumblings, like thunder, continue to emanate from underground, further terrifying the 60,000 homeless victims. Their situation is extremely difficult. Besides everything else, the weather is exceptionally hot, with the temperature consistently around 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Furthermore, food supplies sent from elsewhere are delayed en route. Food is running out, and medicine is nearly exhausted, creating a sense of impending doom. The number of deaths continues to rise as the work of clearing rubble progresses.</p>
<p>Naples, July 25 (Reuters) – Although communication is unreliable, news of the Italian King's arrival by special train in the disaster area this morning has spread throughout the region. Many people have torn colored rags to create red, white, and blue flags, which they have hung on the tents housing the victims. Others have written "Long Live the Emperor" in red flower juice on crumbling walls.</p>
<p>Avellino, July 25 (Reuters) – It is now reported that 2,573 people died and 1,315 were injured in the earthquake in the province of Avellino.</p>
<p>Naples, July 25 (Reuters) – Reports regarding the number of deaths and injuries from Wednesday's earthquake vary. According to the latest official report, the total number of deaths is 1,883. The discrepancies are due to the fact that many of the deceased cannot be identified by name, and many people are missing. The missing have either fled to other places or have died and cannot be located at this time. People in the Mediterranean area often place large stones on their roofs to prevent tiles from being blown away by strong winds. However, these large stones fall through the roofs during severe earthquakes, causing many injuries and deaths. Many victims are homeless and fled in their nightclothes, making the resettlement of refugees a difficult problem.</p>
<p>Rome, July 25 (Reuters) – According to current investigations, a total of 29 villages and towns have been completely or mostly destroyed by the earthquake. Nine of these are located in the province of Avellino. Also, another earthquake occurred near Puglie in the province of Avellino today. Although only one person died, panic has reignited, and the relief problem is becoming increasingly difficult. Despite Prime Minister Mussolini's ban on charitable donations, people are continuously sending donations to the Prime Minister's residence. The total amount has already exceeded one million lire.</p>
<p>London, July 25 (Reuters) – The British King sent a telegram to the Italian King to express condolences for the disaster. The Italian King sent a telegram in response to express gratitude.</p>
<p>New York, July 25 (Reuters) – Various locations in America sent telegrams to the Italian Embassy to express condolences and offer financial assistance for disaster relief. However, the Italian Embassy has received instructions from its government to decline monetary aid because the Italian government is capable of funding the relief efforts itself.</p>

However, if such weapons are carried to political gatherings or for political purposes, fines will not be an option, and the imprisonment must be at least three months. This urgent order was issued because of the frequent armed clashes and bloody incidents between National Socialists and Communists.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 25 (Reuters) – Authorities have ordered a ban on the private possession of stabbing weapons without a license. Violators will face up to one year in prison. Anyone carrying such weapons into political meetings will be sentenced to at least three months in prison. The purpose of this prohibition is to prevent conflicts between members of various parties during the general election.</p>

<p>Wellington, July 25 (Reuters) – An earthquake occurred in Westport, South Island, New Zealand today, lasting one minute. Wellington also felt the earthquake, but it was not as severe as in South Island, and there was no damage.</p>
<p>Mexico City, July 25 (Reuters) – An earthquake occurred in the Peno de Alba region of the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, last night. Before the earthquake, rumbling sounds were heard underground, and there was heavy rain. Residents fled in fear, but fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries.</p>

<p>Paris, July 25 (Reuters) – The Parisian Echo criticizes the new Sino-Vietnamese treaty, stating that it endangers the stability of Vietnam and hopes that the French Parliament will not easily approve it. It claims that such unfavorable concessions to Vietnam by the Foreign Minister are merely intended to induce Nanjing to change its policy of demanding the return of concessions in Shanghai and other locations. However, as long as the Nanjing government exists, nothing will change its demands. Moreover, comparing Shanghai to Vietnam and prioritizing Shanghai over Vietnam is absurd.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Committee for Detailed Examination of Japanese Naval Treaty <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Preliminary Review Has Begun</p>
<p>Committee Chair Not Yet Confirmed</p>
<p>Privy Council Also Criticizes the Government</p>
<p>Ratification Period Likely in September</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 26 (Japan United News) – The selection of the chair and members of the Privy Council's committee for the detailed examination of the London Treaty has attracted much attention from various parties. Speaker Kuratomi will formally decide on the selections within the next two or three days at the latest. Ito and Hirao are the leading candidates for committee chair. The most highly recommended candidates for committee members are Kaneko, Yasuda, Tomii, Ishiguro, Taketa Kenjiro, Ishii, and Horita. The appointment of these individuals would be very unfavorable to the government. (Same source) On July 25th, the Foreign and Naval Ministries submitted the reference documents for the London Treaty, which require preliminary review, to the Privy Council Secretariat. The Privy Council will convene the two Upper Secretaries and relevant personnel from the Foreign, Naval, and Legislative Bureaus at the Secretariat at 10:00 AM on the 26th to begin the review. Because the consultation proposal is an important document composed of English, French, and Japanese texts, its interpretation of each sentence cannot be ignored, so the review will take a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p>Tokyo, July 26 (Electric Communication Agency) – The two Upper Secretaries of the Privy Council, who returned to Tokyo after the deliberation on the arms reduction treaty, will convene relevant officials from the Legislative Bureau, the Naval Ministry, and the Foreign Ministry from today to conduct a preliminary review before submitting it to the detailed examination committee. The preliminary review will require a careful and thorough examination of the vast treaty and political documents.</p>
<p>It will take at least one week to ten days. Speaker Kuratomi of the Privy Council will begin organizing the detailed examination committee during the preliminary review and hold the first committee meeting in early August. However, this issue has been controversial for a long time, and the committee will inevitably stir up waves. Depending on the situation, the second and subsequent committee meetings will be postponed until after the summer. Therefore, the Privy Council's main meeting will likely be delayed until the end of September. In short, the government's hope for ratification in August is almost certainly dashed.</p>
<p>(Same source) Part of the Privy Council believes that Prime Minister Hamaguchi's decision to request the Privy Council's consultation on the treaty proposal at the extraordinary cabinet meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd, prior to consulting with the Council of Admirals, violates Article 7 of the Cabinet Organization Act. If Naval Minister Zaibei reported the content of the consultation response at the cabinet meeting, the Naval Minister would be suspected of leaking military secrets. In any case, the government's actions were inappropriate. The government had previously repeatedly stated that the Council of Admirals meeting was not an absolute condition for treaty ratification, but only a meeting held to ensure the smooth progress of the matter. Furthermore, the extraordinary cabinet meeting decided on the consultation procedure with conditions attached, such as accepting the mandate to review the consultation response, and there was no violation.</p>
<p>(Same source) It is clear that the Privy Council will use the argument that the treaty creates deficiencies in national defense as a means to attack the government. The government, on the other hand, will broadly interpret the Council of Admirals' consultation response. Although the treaty reduces military strength compared to before the treaty, it does not mean that national defense is in danger. The so-called deficiencies are merely relative deficiencies common to all the allied countries and do not entail political responsibility. If the Privy Council attacks, the government will respond accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Organization of British Far East Survey Group Not Yet Finalized <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>London, July 26 (Reuters) – According to the Director of the Overseas Trade Development Council, although the Far East Survey Commission announced by the Minister of Commerce in the House of Commons on Thursday will investigate the commercial market from the general point of view of commerce, it includes a special section on the cotton industry, part of whose expenses will be borne by the Lancashire cotton industry. The organization of the commission is not yet finalized and will likely be announced in the middle of next week, with the departure scheduled for the third week of September. The cotton industry section will form the prototype of the Joint Committee of the Manchester Cotton Industry Organization, which includes representatives of both employers and employees. Before heading to the Far East, the section may stay in Canada for some time before first visiting Japan and then China, where it plans to stay for about three months. The survey group may return home in about six months. Because this trip is under the mission of the government, the results of the investigation will be reported to the government rather than to commercial organizations. After returning home, the Overseas Development Council will consult closely in order to accept all the petitions. The group will likely be the most powerful economic group to go abroad in many years. Representatives from the wool industry, the machinery industry, the cotton industry, and other important industries will participate. The Committee of the Cotton Industry Economic Advisory Office issued a report earlier this month, strongly urging the cotton industry to send a commission to investigate the changes in overseas markets, especially in the Far East. Therefore, the cotton industry is paying special attention to the current survey group.</p>

<p>Washington, July 25 (Reuters) – The new agreement between the Mexican government to clear foreign debt and national railway debts was signed today by Mexican Finance Minister Dr. Toja and Mr. Lament, Chairman of the American Bankers International Committee. The total amount of the old debt is US $513,000,000, which will now be converted into 5% interest bonds worth US $492,000,000. Interest arrears will also be greatly reduced. The total amount of unpaid interest on direct debt is approximately US $200,000,000. The Mexican Railway is now bankrupt and will be reorganized. The Mexican government's direct debt is now reduced to US $267,000,000, which will be guaranteed by customs revenue. The railway debt is now reduced to US $225,000,000. The new bonds will have a term of 45 years.</p>

<p>Russian Commercial Representative's Building to Be Auctioned</p>
<p>Paris, July 25 (National News Agency) – The building of the Soviet Russian Commercial Representative in Paris will be auctioned off next week. The proceeds will be used to repay the French company one million pounds owed by the Finnish-Russian Shipping Trust. The court previously ruled that the debt should be paid, but the Russian side appealed. The result was that the original judgment was upheld, so it will be executed next week. The fact that a formal Soviet Russian commercial representative is suffering this fate is rare in international relations. Therefore, political circles in various countries mostly see it as a sign of increasing estrangement between France and Russia.</p>

<p>Kaunas, July 25 (National News Agency) – Former Lithuanian Prime Minister Hutma, who wielded dictatorial power during his tenure, was suddenly arrested today by the authorities and sent to live in a small town in a remote province, where he is being strictly monitored by the police. Recently, Hutma has been quite active. There has been speculation that he will soon regain power. Therefore, the authorities consider his behavior disruptive to law and order and have placed him under surveillance. They also allege that he refuses to move out of the house he lived in when he was a dictator and still wants others to call him Prime Minister, which they say are clear signs of mental illness. However, Hutma's friends do not agree with this claim and are requesting that foreign experts examine him.</p>

It is expected that this failure will affect the relationship between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, as one of the reasons for the Liberal Party's support of the Labor Party's cabinet is the hope of reforming what they call an outdated and unsuitable electoral system.</p>

<p>Kozu, July 26 (Electric Communication Agency) – Inukai, President of the Seiyukai, suddenly changed his plans to visit Fujimi and went to Jehol this morning. In the train, he told reporters who came to visit that the government's consultation with the Privy Council on the arms reduction treaty was superficially strong, but in reality, it was extremely weak. Naval Minister Zaibei remained in the most difficult position because the government strongly pleaded with him. He planned to resign for other reasons after the ratification and the establishment of the national defense plan. Hamaguchi, despite being called a lion, is also prone to crying. Even if the Privy Council approves the ratification, it will inevitably attach a warning. Hamaguchi's attitude at this time is quite noteworthy. He may not be willing to resign, and only the Naval Minister may resign. However, the most important issues for the government are the economic downturn and unemployment. The government should not be bound by appearances and should sincerely strive for relief.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>○ Legislative Yuan 102nd Meeting: The Legislative Yuan held its 102nd meeting from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM on the 26th. 28 committee members were present, with Hu Hanmin presiding. The matters discussed were as follows: (1) Reviewing the Executive Yuan's request for interpretation of ambiguous clauses in the Township Autonomy Implementation Law, County Organization Implementation Law, and City Organization Law regarding the residential meetings and seals of neighborhoods and villages. It was resolved that the word "its" in Article 84 refers to neighborhoods and villages and not to the meetings of residents, and that this interpretation should be reported back to the Executive Yuan. (2) The Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan reported on the review of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Public Bond Regulations and the Principal and Interest Repayment Schedule. It was resolved to amend and approve. (3) The Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee proposed that the regulations of the Postal Savings and Remittance Administration be sent to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan for review. It was resolved to forward the proposal to the Executive Yuan. (4) The National Government, based on the request of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, submitted a draft amendment to Articles 3 and 7 of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Public Bond Regulations to the Legislative Yuan for review. It was resolved to discuss it together with the second case. (5) The Central Political Council submitted to the Legislative Yuan for amendment Articles 6 and 7 of the Anti-Revolutionary Punishment Law. It was resolved to refer it to the Legal System Committee for review.</p>
<p>○ Ministry of Interior Requests Interpretation of the Administrative Appeal Law: The Ministry of Interior yesterday submitted a report to the Executive Yuan stating that Article 1 of the Administrative Appeal Law stipulates that people may file an administrative appeal if their rights or interests are harmed due to illegal or improper actions by central or local government agencies. However, the text only mentions "people" and does not mention "officials." If an official is subject to administrative punishment, can they file an administrative appeal as a "person"? It seems necessary to have an interpretation. As this concerns legal interpretation, the Ministry is not in a position to make a decision and therefore submits the Administrative Appeal Law for referral to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation.</p>
<p>○ Hunan Province's Regional Bandit Suppression Plan</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province has suffered greatly from the Communist scourge for the past three years and has not had a single day of peace. During the war against the Gui army, the Communist bandits took the opportunity to stir up trouble. Peng Dehuai disrupted Pingyue, Huang Gonglue and Kong Hezhong disrupted Liuyang and Liling, He Long disrupted Nanhua, and Zhou Wen disrupted Yangming. In addition, bandits have sprung up like bees in the Xiangxi region's Chenyuan area and the Xiangzhong region's Baowu area. Travelers are wary on the roads. Almost none of the province's 76 counties are clean. However, the bandit scourge varies in size. He Jian has decided to take advantage of the end of the campaign against the Gui army to launch a large-scale suppression campaign, dividing the province into five bandit suppression zones and assigning forces of four divisions and one garrison command to be responsible for each zone, starting on August 1st and aiming to eliminate all bandits in each zone within two months. The allocated regional plan was officially announced yesterday with the following order: "Investigating that this time, the Gui rebels have roamed through various places in Hunan Province, looting and leaving behind firearms, and the Communist bandits have taken the opportunity to be rampant, endangering public security, it is necessary to divide the regions to search and thoroughly eliminate them. We must eradicate the roots to ensure local stability. The following regulations are hereby stipulated for the bandit suppression zones of each unit: (1) Changsha, Yueyang, Linxiang, Ningxiang, Xiangyin, Pingjiang, Liuyang, and Liling counties are the bandit suppression zone of the 15th Division, with Division Commander Wei Suzhong as the commander. (2) Hengyang, Hengshan, Qiyang, Lingling, Dong'an, Leiyang, Yongxing, Changning, Youxian, Chaling, Anren, Hengxian, Guidong, Rucheng, Yizhang, Chenxian, Zixing, Guiyang, Xintian, Jiahe, Linwu, Lanshan, Ningyuan, Jianghua, Yongming, Daoxian, and Yangming counties are the bandit suppression zone of the 19th Division, with Division Commander Liu Jianxu as the commander. (3) Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, Anhua, Xinhua, Luxipu, Zhijiang, Huangxian, Qianyang, Huitong, Jingxian, Tongdao, Suining, Chengbu, Xinning, Wugang, and Baoqing counties are the bandit suppression zone of the 16th Division, with Division Commander Luo Fanying as the commander. (4) Nanxian, Huarong, Yuanjiang, Yiyang, Lixian, Anxiang, Cili, Shimen, Linli, Changde, Taoyuan, and Hanshou counties are the bandit suppression zone of the 31st Division, with Division Commander Tao Guang as the commander. (5) Dayong, Chenxi, Luxi, Yuanling, Mayang, Yongshun, Baojing, Longshan, Sangzhi, Guzhang, Qiancheng, Fenghuang, and Yongsu counties are the bandit suppression zone of the First Garrison Headquarters, with Commander Chen Quzhen as the commander. (6) Each unit shall thoroughly eliminate the bandit scourge in each county within its zone, starting from August 1st, with a time limit of two months, and shall also be responsible for supervising and reorganizing the local militias in its zone. Each unit shall carefully plan, assign troops to be responsible for defense and suppression, and report the troop deployment locations and arrival dates, as well as the bandit suppression situation, for record purposes. This order." Currently, Wei Suzhong, commander of the First Zone, entered Pingjiang County on the 22nd and is pursuing the bandit Peng Dehuai. Liu Jianxu, commander of the Second Zone, departed from Changsha for Hengzhou on the 21st to take charge of the suppression. Luo Fanying, commander of the Third Zone, is currently searching for the remnants of Tang Zhemin and Li Zemin in Wugang and has been pursuing them for days. Tao Guang, commander of the Fourth Zone, has arrived in Changde from the province and is drawing troops to suppress He Long in various directions. Chen Quzhen, commander of the Fifth Zone, is currently in Fenghuang and will cooperate with the Fourth Zone to suppress He Long.</p>
<p>He also believes that the bandits Peng, Huang, and He Long have a large following and are spreading throughout Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. It would be difficult to eliminate them unless the three provinces join forces. Although joint suppression campaigns have been held in the past, they were not effective because no experienced military officers were in charge of commanding the troops of the three provinces. He specially telegraphed Generalissimo Chiang, requesting that He Yingqin be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi in order to unify the command and eliminate the bandit scourge.

<h3 id="e79">Case of Sailors Assaulting Chinese Sailors <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Incident Details and Diplomatic Documents</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The French gunboat stationed in Hankou originally had ten Chinese sailors: Zhang Mouqing, Chen Yuancai, He Changfa, Zhang Shaohua, Zhou Yuwen, Zhang Dechao, Zhang Bingquan, Chen Senlin, Zhu Zihui, and Zheng Jingtang. On the evening of the 18th of this month, at 8 PM, they were suddenly and violently beaten by sailors from the same vessel. Furthermore, the first officer of the ship dismissed Zhang and the others, refusing to pay their wages and forcibly disembarking them. Zhang and the others then filed a complaint with the Seamen's Association, seeking relief. After investigation by the Association, the facts were confirmed. A formal letter was sent to Li Fang, the diplomatic inspector of the five provinces, and submitted to the Hankou Municipal Government for forwarding to the French consulate for serious negotiations. It is reported that the Municipal Government has, on the 25th, consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging the French side to provide a proper resolution. The following is an excerpt of various documents related to this case:</p>
<p>Petition from Workers: Requesting urgent assistance and rescue. We, the undersigned workers, have been serving as sailors on the French gunboat "Dupleix" for many years. On the evening of July 18th, at 8 PM, we were inexplicably and brutally beaten by the ship's sailors. They even threatened to throw us into the water for amusement. Seeing the sailors' violence and ruthlessness, we had no choice but to seek protection from the ship's first officer in order to save our lives. Unexpectedly, the first officer not only failed to protect us but also said that such trivial matters should not be reported and ordered each of us to pay a fine of one dollar. We argued against this. Seeing our debate, the first officer forced us to leave the ship within five minutes. Seeing that the first officer was determined to suppress us, we requested the ship's interpreter, Yu Fanshi, to ask the first officer to calculate and pay the wages we were entitled to for this month before leaving the ship. However, the first officer stubbornly refused to pay and threw our luggage and bedding into the river. All of the circumstances of the first officer's oppression and mistreatment of us can be testified to by the ship's interpreter, Yu Fanshi, and the kitchen steward. We are deeply concerned that we have been subjected to insults and abuse and denied our wages without any fault on our part. Therefore, we respectfully submit this document, requesting that your association promptly forward it to the Hankou Municipal Government for serious negotiations with the French consulate to maintain our livelihoods and protect our lives. This would be for the public good. (Signed) Zhang Mouqing, Chen Yuancai, He Changfa, Zhang Shaohua, Zhou Yuwen, Zhang Dechao, Zhang Bingquan, Chen Senlin, Zhu Zihui, and Zheng Jingtang, formerly employed on the French gunboat "Dupleix".</p>
<p>Report on Investigation and Reply: Regarding the assigned task of investigating the case of the unjustified dismissal of workers by the first officer of the French gunboat "Dupleix". According to a report from a Mr. Zhou, a chef in the Western kitchen of the "Dupleix" gunboat, at approximately 8 PM on July 18th, French sailors returned to the ship drunk and saw Zhang Dechao, a boy servant of the interpreter Yu, sleeping on the deck of the front cabin. They kicked him and wanted to throw him into the river. Sailors of the ship, unable to bear the situation, tried to dissuade the sailors, which angered them. They then sought out Chinese sailors and beat them severely. To avoid disaster, the sailors had no choice but to report to the first officer, requesting that he stop the violence. Unexpectedly, the first officer sided with the French sailors and rebuked the Chinese sailors for reporting to him, ordering each of them to pay a fine of one dollar; otherwise, they would have to leave the ship within five minutes, and their wages would not be paid. Because the first officer gave the order, the sailors relied on their power to throw the sailors' luggage into the river and expel them from the ship. It is appropriate to report the obtained information truthfully. (Signed) Reporter: Liu Yunqing.</p>
<p>Letter to Li Fang: Dear Sir, Regarding the petition from workers Zhang Mouqing and others, we have dispatched personnel to investigate and report the aforementioned circumstances. In light of this, we have found that the sailors of the "Dupleix" gunboat beat Chinese without cause, and the first officer did not intervene, but instead abused his authority to force the workers to leave the ship and refused to pay them their due wages, throwing away the workers' bedding. This kind of oppressive behavior is sufficient to expose the inferiority of imperialism. In addition to submitting a separate report to the Hankou Municipal Government requesting prompt forwarding for serious negotiations, we hereby send this letter to Your Excellency, the inspector, requesting that you examine the matter and handle it accordingly. We hope for your cooperation. (The letter to the Municipal Government is omitted.) (July 25th)</p>
<p>○ Reorganization of Salt Affairs in Fujian Province</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Yang Shuzhuang's return to Fujian this time is intended to first reorganize finances to increase revenue, and it has been decided to start with the reorganization of salt administration. Yesterday, Chen Peikun, He Gonggan, Li Zhiyu, Shen Jinmian, and Chen Erlu, the secretary of the Transportation Office, were specially convened in the Provincial Government Conference Room to discuss ways to reorganize the salt administration for implementation. It is also heard that Transportation Commissioner Shen will go to Beijing in a few days to participate in a salt affairs conference.</p>
<p>During Chen Fu's tenure, the Fujian Salt Smuggling Suppression Team was divided into sixteen large teams, each with three medium-sized teams. After Mr. Liu Xiaoting took over the head of the investigation bureau, he found that the original organization was not in line with the regulations. A few days ago, he ordered the abolition of the large team titles and renamed them battalions, with a total of six battalions, each with three companies. He also ordered the department to draft various opinions for him to take to Beijing to discuss with Minister Song, and he has already packed and is waiting for the boat. (23rd)</p>
<p>○ Zhao Jie Assassinated</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Zhao Jie, the younger brother of Zhao Ti, the former governor of Henan, volunteered two months ago, saying that a certain unit in Henan Province used to be under his command and that he could recruit them for our use. Liu Zhi, the commander-in-chief of the Second Army Corps, in order to enlist miscellaneous troops to prevent them from being used by the enemy, presented a request to Generalissimo Chiang to appoint Zhao as the commander of the Garrison Army, with Dong Zhentang as his deputy. The original order was for him to enter Henan to recruit and reorganize. However, Zhao set up his headquarters at the Jiangbei Hotel in Dongguan and appointed Zhang and Sun as commanders of the First and Second Garrison Brigades, ordering them to recruit bandits in the surrounding villages, resulting in the accumulation of bandits such as Cao Chuanjin, who was also appointed as a regimental commander. There were open robberies and secret thefts, and the local area was in turmoil. In May, Zhao was ordered to be transferred to Henan. Zhang's unit, the First Brigade he had recruited, was unwilling to be transferred. The garrison commander of Xuzhou, Song Runtian, together with the county public security team, disbanded the brigade. On the 13th of this month, Cao Chuanjin's bandit unit stationed at Daxujia was ordered to enter Henan, but when they arrived at Donghe Village, they rebelled again and became bandits. Commander-in-chief Liu learned of this and telegraphed the Xuzhou Garrison Command from Yanzhou on the 23rd, stating that, "In order to enlist miscellaneous troops to prevent them from being used by the enemy, this headquarters presented a request to the Generalissimo to approve the appointment of Zhao Jie as the commander of the Garrison Army of this Army Corps and Dong Zhentang as the deputy commander, ordering them to recruit old units in Henan to harass the enemy. Unexpectedly, after being appointed, the commander recruited complex elements in Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui provinces and acted improperly. Later, this headquarters discovered this and limited the commander to lead his troops to Zhecheng and Taikang to work. According to reports, most of the troops are now in Xiayi, but some are still staying in Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui provinces, refusing to comply with the order to move out. Furthermore, they are recruiting bandits under the guise of pacification, disturbing the local area repeatedly, which is extremely illegal and deeply hateful. In addition to ordering the commander to supervise the troops that have entered Henan to work hard to attack the enemy and ordering the cancellation of the recruitment of those who remain in Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui provinces, if anyone else uses the name of the unit to recruit bandits and disturb the area, please order your subordinates to arrest them strictly."

<p>○ New Information on the Heinous Murders in Shenyang Shenyang Correspondence: In the case of the heinous murders of eight people in the Li residence in the commercial port area, after the arrest and delivery of Deng Haiquan to the court, several interrogations have not yet revealed the truth. It has recently been learned that the mastermind of the case has been arrested in Beijing and escorted to the Shenyang court. The court is keeping the names of the perpetrators and the details of the arrest secret. However, according to investigations, the culprit's surname is Wang, his given name is Weiguo, and he used to be a section member in a certain institution. Before Deng Haiquan's arrest, when the matter had not been revealed, Wang Weiguo had no intention of escaping. After Deng was arrested, Wang learned the truth and realized that he could not stay in the provincial capital, so he went to Beijing to take refuge temporarily. Wang's home is inside the South Gate. The court and the Public Security Bureau had previously searched it, but there was no evidence. Unexpectedly, after Wang went to Beijing, he missed his wife and sent a letter home, stating that he was living comfortably in a certain place in Beijing and that she should not worry. This letter was intercepted by the police bureau and handed over to the court. Combining this with Deng Haiquan's confession, it was learned that the mastermind had fled to Beijing. The chief prosecutor of the procuratorate of the court, Xue Shuping, and prosecutor Wu Xubin, took the train to Beijing on the evening of the 16th of this month. After arriving in Beijing, they requested assistance from the Beijing police to go to Wang's residence and arrest him immediately. The Beijing Public Security Bureau sent a police officer to escort him to Shenyang. He arrived in Shenyang at 6:40 AM on the 20th, aboard the third special express train. When the suspect got off the train, he was wearing a gray silk long gown and white silk trousers, with handcuffs and shackles. The scene was extremely serious. The car was specially prepared by the court. In addition to the suspect and the driver, there were also two plainclothes officers (the prosecutors) and many police officers escorting him. Observers recognized the suspect, Wang Weiguo, who had worked with the deceased Li Peiqin in the Railway Law Enforcement Office. There was also bloodstained clothing and a large bag of related photos in the car. The cause of the case is no more than two: financial gain and adultery. However, given Wang's position and status, the issue of financial gain is unlikely to be the problem. It is only that Li Peiqin's wife, Shang Lingzhi, used to be a drum singer, and Wang and Peiqin were colleagues. There may have been some relationship between them. (21st)</p>

<p>Dispatch Personnel to Investigate Prison Escape Case: The Fengxian County Prison under the High Court has more than eighty prisoners, mostly bandits and thieves. At approximately 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 21st, while guard Ding was distributing the prisoners' evening meals, the prisoners suddenly rioted and rushed out of the gate, taking away the guns of the gate guards and the Public Security Bureau, injuring five or six guards. A total of fifty-eight people escaped out of the gate at that time. Prison warden Liu Ou immediately telegraphed the county government. County Magistrate Shen Qingchen personally led the police and the Public Security Bureau chief to pursue the escaped prisoners. The escaped prisoners opened fire to resist arrest, and the police bravely fought back, killing twenty-three escaped prisoners on the spot and capturing thirteen. Twenty-two escaped. County Magistrate Shen immediately ordered the captured escaped prisoners to be taken to the county for detention and telegraphed Prison Warden Liu to the county for questioning about the incident. Because the prison escape was due to the warden's poor management, he ordered the warden to be taken into custody for investigation. Yesterday (26th), he telegraphed High Court President Lin to request instructions. President Lin immediately dispatched Yao Guozhang, the director of the prison section, to Fengxian to investigate and report.</p>
<p>Detailed Account of the Fengcheng Prison Break: Since the early days of the Republic of China, before the current term, the Fengcheng prison has had seven prison breaks, large and small. In the last two years, there have been three in succession. However, the person in charge has been confused and has allowed his subordinates to act illegally and recklessly, resulting in another major case of armed prison break on the 21st. A week before the case, secret meetings had been held repeatedly in the prison, which was learned by Long Shao (a person elected by the veteran prisoners). He secretly reported to the prison officials, but was blamed for spreading rumors. Long Shao was angry and secretly communicated with the prisoners. On the 21st, when Long Shao saw an opportunity, he went to summon the prisoners. So more than a hundred prisoners rushed out during the 4:00 PM mealtime. Most of the shackles had already been destroyed. The prisoners first knocked down the gate guards and robbed their guns. Then they rushed to the Public Security Bureau No. 2 next door to rob guns, and then fired wildly outside, fleeing in all directions from the east and south gates. The Public Security Bureau team stationed there heard the news and pursued them. The escaped prisoners gathered at the east gate and pushed the murderer Wu Liang to lead the way back to resist arrest. The fighting was like a major battle. It is estimated that more than 800 bullets were fired. However, the area was open and close to the coast, resulting in many escapes. The county government was too far away and did not receive the alarm until midnight. County Magistrate Shen led a team of the county police force and Commander Ding Zhiyan with a part of wooden shell guns to suppress the riot and sent officers to search in all directions. County Magistrate Shen personally rewarded the prisoners who did not escape. Yesterday (23rd), the aftermath was properly handled. In addition to reporting the case for instructions, it was determined that the cause of the case was entirely due to the negligence of the prison warden Liu Ou, so he was taken back into custody to await disposal. According to the person in charge, the exact number of escapees was 22, with 12 captured. Including the three prisoners who were found drowned in Xiaohong yesterday, the total number of those who were killed and captured was 27. However, the previous report that many residents were injured by stray bullets was just a rumor and not true.</p>

<p>Seventy-Seven-Year-Old Man Burned to Death by Thieves: Feng Kunrong, a farmer from Yuxiangzhen, Luoshe, in the 16th District (Wan'an), was seventy-seven years old and in good health, but his hearing was impaired. His eldest son is a skilled chef and is currently working as a chef in Japan. His second son is studying at a university in Shanghai, and his eldest grandson is studying at Soochow Middle School in Suzhou. Unexpectedly, after 1 AM the night before last, seven thieves sailed a small boat to the pier in front of Feng's house. The thieves, holding knives, crowded ashore and first went to rob Feng's neighbor. His daughter-in-law heard the noise and urgently told Kunrong to escape, but Kunrong's hearing was impaired. While he was groping, the thieves had already broken into the house, grabbed Kunrong, and forced him to reveal where the silver was hidden. Kunrong falsely claimed that he was a long-term worker. The thieves were angry at his cunning and found kerosene to pour over Kunrong's body and set him on fire, causing him to be burned all over. They then searched everywhere and took away the loot after an hour. After the incident, his family immediately hired a boat to take Kunrong to the brothers hospital in the city, but he was severely injured and died soon after. His family has already arranged for his coffin and is urging his son to return to Wuxi to handle the funeral and report the incident to the authorities for investigation.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Guns Robbed: After 10 PM the night before last, more than twenty young people took four prostitutes and rode in three water carriages on the Ten Mile Ronghu Lake, enjoying the scenery and laughing loudly all the way. When the boat reached Jiangjiankou, the sentry post of the Chamber of Commerce saw them and suspected them of being bandits. They shone a flashlight on the boat, and the young people suspected that they were intentionally insulting them, so they shouted loudly and then went ashore to make trouble for the Chamber of Commerce, and their guns were robbed. The Chamber of Commerce members rushed to inform Chen Suliang, the commander of the Tenth Detachment, who led all the members to pursue them. The people on the boat were enjoying themselves with the guns they had robbed from the Chamber of Commerce. After Commander Chen asked them, the young people refused to show weakness, and a conflict broke out. In the darkness, they fought for a long time, and both sides were injured. It is heard that some of the young people were wearing uniforms and were members of the police force. Both sides have now reported the details to the county government and requested a thorough investigation. When the two sides were fighting fiercely, the people in Beicheng, who did not know the truth, were greatly shocked because the rumors were flourishing and it was late at night.</p>
<p>Investigation into Rumor-Mongering Case Clarified: The night before last, a young man named Zhu Maoquan impersonated the head of the 31st Regiment of the 17th National Revolutionary Army and wantonly spread rumors at the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau outside the South Gate. He then went to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau outside the Guangfu Gate to spread the same rumors. He was discovered by the bureau, arrested, and interrogated. It is learned that the Suzhou Military Police Regiment Joint Inspection Office recently captured a reactionary criminal, and one Zhu Jicheng escaped. Now it is reported that a Zhu Maoquan in our county claimed to be the head of the regiment and spread rumors and was arrested and interrogated. The office urgently needs to investigate and verify whether Zhu Maoquan is the escaped reactionary criminal Zhu Jicheng.

<p>The Twists and Turns of Arresting a Suspected Military Officer: Li Cunde, residing in the city, claimed to have been appointed as the commander of the 2nd Regiment of the 1st Detachment by a certain military guerrilla headquarters some time ago to carry out recruitment duties. The night before, a man claiming to be Secretary Liu of the current 8th Army Guerrilla Headquarters, along with a Mr. Guo, arrested Li Cunde at Huojia Bridge, believing Li to be a fake military officer. They then escorted him to Yangzhou and housed him at the Tiancheng Hotel, intending to transport him elsewhere. However, yesterday (the 24th) at 10 AM, military police inspectors inspecting the hotel suspected that while Li was a suspect, Liu and Guo may also be impersonating military officers. Because the arresters did not have the appropriate official documents, all three were taken to the brigade headquarters for transfer. The headquarters will first detain them and send telegrams to the military units to which each claimed to belong to verify the truth. Further decisions will be made after the responses from the two units arrive in Yangzhou.</p>

It has been nine years since then, and the rice has not been distributed. The Fifth District Fourth Branch had sent a letter to Xu Ruizhou, the former chairman of the board of directors, and Yang Tai, the local security officer in charge of the rice at the time. Both replied in writing that Cai Yuquan, the former chairman of the Farmers' Association, had taken the rice. The branch then sent a letter to Cai, setting a deadline for its return.

<p>Continued Transportation of Rice for Sale at a Fair Price: The County Chamber of Commerce, due to the high price of rice and the lack of supply, specially commissioned Wang Jingting to purchase several thousand bags of foreign rice and transport them from Shanghai to Yangzhou for sale at a fair price to maintain the people's food supply. Now that the season of shortage between crops has arrived, another four thousand bags of foreign rice have been transported to Yangzhou. The rice is being sold at the Jinxi Rice Store's large warehouse near Xiangshui Bridge at the South Gate, reducing costs and setting the price at sixteen yuan per dan and three hundred sixty cash per sheng for retail sales. Starting from the 27th of the National Calendar, from 8 AM to 12 PM every morning, buyers can go to the accounting table to pay the price, receive a ticket, and redeem the rice.

Now, an instruction from superiors has been received, informing them that Cui has again made accusations, urging a well-considered removal of the title of head of the general field and an immediate cancellation of the position of director. It is clear that Cui is making false accusations due to his lack of success. In addition to complying with the order, a trusted official has been specially dispatched to secretly investigate. If the accusations are found to be false, Cui will be arrested and prosecuted for false accusations to deter such improper behavior.

The county government has now decided to distribute the fair price sales loss subsidies starting on August 1st and has issued orders to the fair price sales offices in each district to instruct the rice shops and stores involved in fair price sales to bring their fair price vouchers to the government at that time to receive the loss subsidies. At the same time, the Finance Bureau has been ordered to allocate 10,000 yuan to pay for the Zhuyin Fuhao training courses. The Zhuyin Fuhao Training Course in the Second Middle School District is scheduled to open on July 28th at Jiaxing Second Middle School. Previously, the organizers sent letters to the education bureaus of Jiaxing, Jiashan, Haiyan, Tongxiang, Chongde, Pinghu and other six counties to send personnel to attend and promote the course. The trainees from each county have been assigned by the education bureaus.</p>

<p>Chunhui Ransom Impossible to Rescue: Fan Shoukang, the principal of Chunhui Middle School in Yiting, teacher Wu Minxing, and student Xia Dingcai were kidnapped by bandits over a month ago. Although the families have repeatedly received letters from the bandits demanding ransom, there is no place to make contact, so they have not yet been rescued. However, according to reports, the bandits are indeed in the Siming Mountains, so Chen Yuhui, the commander of the Second Battalion of the Security Brigade, recently sent troops to the mountains to rescue them. However, the mountains are unusually steep, and the bandits are long-time residents and familiar with the terrain. By the time the soldiers arrived, they had already moved with the hostages, making it impossible for the soldiers to rescue them. They returned to camp yesterday and reported their mission.</p>

<p>Investigating the Bribery Case of Trial Officer and Tobacco Offender: The County Party Department's Propaganda Department disclosed in a current affairs briefing at 2 PM that "a prison officer colluded with judicial personnel to extort 185 yuan from tobacco offender He Baoqing and has been prosecuted." This short news item was known to Trial Officer Zhu Yao, who believed that since this matter involved collusion and bribery between administrative and judicial personnel, it should not be ignored. He decided to conduct a thorough investigation. At the same time, public opinion generally suspected Kong Gongxian, a record keeper in the county government. The findings of the investigation are recorded as follows: Previously, the Baiguan Public Security Branch arrested a current tobacco offender named He Baoqing last month and handed him over to the county government. After interrogation, he was found guilty of both trafficking and smoking tobacco and sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Later, He's family hired a local gentry and retired bailiff Chen Changshou to bribe Kong with 185 yuan to arrange for his release. Later, He requested to seek treatment outside of the jail, claiming to be seriously ill. Trial Officer Zhu approved it because he realized that this happened during summer and not allowed it. Thus, He's family and Chen Changshou, due to Kong's ineffectiveness, not only threatened Kong with prosecution to recover the 185 yuan but also spread rumors about the bribery process, which was then exposed and conveyed to a certain cadre in the County Party Department, hence the item on the briefing. Zhu was extremely indignant after hearing the news and photographed the briefing on the 22nd to keep as evidence. He also sought clues to the case in the hope of uncovering the truth.</p>

<p>Accidental Shooting Case Scheduled for Trial: In the case where Chen Xijiu, an investigator in the Xiaoshan County Public Security Bureau, accidentally shot and killed guard Guo Yongxiang while cleaning his gun, the deceased's father and brother had already submitted a request to the county court to close the case after mediation. However, Prosecutor Yang had already investigated the case and filed a lawsuit, so it was not approved. It is heard that the case is scheduled to be heard on August 2nd for further verification and judgment.</p>
<p>Reduced Tobacco Leaf Harvest: Sidu in Xiaoshan has always been a tobacco-producing area, and the annual income is considerable. However, this year, the area was affected by a windstorm that blew the crops down, followed by the prevalence of pestilence, causing the withered plants to die everywhere. The general laboring farmers are quite worried.</p>

<p>France's Cochet Wins 3-0 Against the United States' George Lott</p>
<p>(Paris Dispatch, 25th) The Davis Cup, which has been the focus of global attention in recent years, has become a contest between the United States and France.

<p>French Player Dominates: At the start of the first set, France's Borotra performed excellently, displaying all his superb skills. The veteran Tilden from the United States was unable to support it and was defeated by the opponent with a score of 6-2 in the first set, which seemed to be no difficulty.</p>
<p>Veteran Seizes Opportunity: The veteran has been on the battlefield for a long time, with a calm will. The cannonball-like serve constantly attacked the French player, occupying an excellent advantage. Borotra succumbed to the veteran's power and lost the second and third sets with scores of 5-7 and 4-6.</p>
<p>Final Effort: The French player initially struggled in the fourth set but made efforts to catch up, which was very exciting. The audience was amazed. Starting with a 1-4 deficit, he gradually came to life through his indomitable struggle. While resisting the veteran's formidable抽擊(chou ji) serve, he calmly seized the opportunity to counterattack and reached a 5-5 tie. It was not easy. Unfortunately, the veteran managed to win the last two games. The veteran won the fourth set with a score of 7-5. In total, the United States' Tilden won with a score of 3-1.</p>

<p>Winning 3-0</p>
<p>Recovering from Adversity: France's Cochet won straight sets with scores of 6-4, 6-2, and 6-2 against the United States' Lott. However, at the beginning of the match, the French player was quite careless, giving the opponent a 4-3 lead, which caused dissatisfaction among the French fans in the audience. Fortunately, the French player rallied in time and recovered from adversity, finally winning with a score of 6-4.</p>
<p>Sweeping the Army: Since the first set, Cochet has shown great power, with amazing 抽繫(chou xi) and shocking interceptions, making the American player unable to cope. As a result, the French player won the second and third sets with scores of 6-2 and 6-2. In total, Cochet won with a score of 3-0.</p>

The defender, Sun Baoqing, with a tall body, was in the rear to snatch the ball with lightning speed, so there was no mistake.

<p>The Ministry of Education explained that private junior high school graduates who are not registered may be admitted to senior high schools if they are of comparable level and pass the examination. The Zhejiang Department of Education was informed by telegram that Article 17 of the Provisional Regulations for Middle Schools stipulates that "the qualifications for admission to senior high schools are graduation from junior high school. If they do not have the above qualifications but are of comparable level and pass the examination, they may also be admitted." Private junior high school graduates who are not registered may be admitted to senior high schools if they are of comparable level and pass the examination, and there is no need to set up a separate preliminary examination for admission. However, they must comply with the Ministry's No. 854 Instruction of the previous year ("Strictly Regulate the Admission Qualifications of Enrolled Students"). All levels of schools should strictly handle the enrollment of students. The qualifications for admission to colleges and universities must be graduation from senior high schools or equivalent schools, and students with equivalent academic qualifications may not be admitted. The qualifications for admission to secondary schools must be handled in accordance with Article 17 of the Provisional Regulations for Middle Schools promulgated by the former University Council. The measures to restrict those with equivalent academic qualifications should be strictly stipulated by the universities in each university district, the provincial education departments, or the special municipal education bureaus according to local conditions in order to ensure verification. The Department will stipulate the ratio of this type of student to the total number of newly admitted students.</p>

<p>Visited This Newspaper Yesterday for a Week</p>
<p>Scheduled to Take a Ship to Japan at the End of This Month</p>
<p>Mr. Meng Xinni, a reporter for the Turkish Ikada Life Daily, set off from Paris, France, in June to travel to Eastern Egypt, India, the South Sea Islands, and other places to investigate the political and social conditions of the East. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago for a short rest and will take a ship to Japan on the 30th before heading to the United States for about three months before returning to Constantinople. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Meng, accompanied by Lu Zhongxiang and others, visited this newspaper. According to him, the greatest impression he gained from his travels to various Eastern countries was the awakening of the Eastern people and their efforts towards freedom and independence, and he firmly believes that they will soon succeed. He had originally planned to meet Gandhi during his stay in India, but ultimately failed to do so. Given the current spirit of the Indian people, he believes that Britain will ultimately be unable to completely suppress them, and at the very least, it should be like Egypt, acknowledging India's independence while Britain maintains a supervisory role. Finally, he said that today's China is similar to the former Turkey, and without the abolition of unequal treaties, it will never achieve liberation. He hopes that the Chinese government and people will unite and strive to achieve final victory.</p>

<h3 id="e122">News of the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike Yesterday <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Central Government Sends Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>Four Statements from the French Concession</p>
<p>The Union Refuses to Accept</p>
<p>Huadong News reports that the expansion of the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike is becoming increasingly serious. The factory has consistently shown no sincerity in resolving the issue, making it difficult for mediators and preventing the restoration of traffic in the French Concession. The news from yesterday is recorded again below:</p>
<p>Central Government Attitude: Yang Qingyuan, previously sent by the Municipal Party Department to the Central Government for reporting, has now returned to Shanghai. To understand the Central Government's handling of this matter, a reporter interviewed Comrade Chen Junyi, a member of the Standing Committee of the People's Training Association. According to him, Comrade Yang reported to the Central Party Department upon arriving in Beijing and had a discussion with Central Committee members Chen Lifu, Chen Guofu, and Shi Weihuan of the Central Party Department. The meeting took place on Thursday, the day of the Central Party Department's regular meeting. The Central Committee was very attentive to this matter and immediately decided on two measures: (1) Regarding the tragedy, the Central Committee will forward it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate and protest with the French Ambassador. (2) Regarding the labor strike, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, the People's Training Association, and the Shanghai Municipal Government are responsible for handling it together. In order to understand the occurrence and current situation of this matter, the Central Committee specially sent Comrade Wang Xingzhou to Shanghai to investigate, so that future negotiations can be carried out. Comrade Wang met with Yu at the People's Training Association yesterday morning and gave a detailed report on the progress. It is also heard that the Central Committee has specially asked Central Committee member Li Shizeng to handle everything nearby.</p>
<p>French Concession Statement: Since the union gave a warning and the Municipal Government sent Secretary Geng to negotiate, the French Concession has not been as dismissive as before. In recent days, it has been studying the various conditions one by one and has made four statements: (1) Wages will be paid for the strike period. (2) Regarding the issue of wage increases, it verbally acknowledges an increase of three yuan per person. (3) It expresses acceptance in principle regarding the tragedy. (4) Workers must return to work according to a list provided by the factory, and more than a hundred workers must be dismissed. The above statements are a response to the warning received by the French Concession.</p>
<p>Union Rejects: The union is extremely indignant about the above four statements from the French Concession and absolutely refuses to accept them. The dismissal of more than a hundred workers is particularly outrageous. This labor movement is exceptionally just, and to dismiss so many workers simply because of the strike is tantamount to a complete failure of the labor movement. Moreover, the French Concession requires the implementation of the four conditions to wait until after the resumption of work, making its intentions even more unpredictable. Therefore, they would rather persist to the end and wait for the resolution of the Central Government and the authorities.</p>
<p>Economic Assistance: The support associations of various labor unions have been discussing their work busily in recent days. It has been decided to donate art to relieve the striking workers of the Water and Electricity Union, and a special report has been submitted to the Municipal Party Department for approval. It is now known that the Municipal People's Training Association has replied, approving the donation and instructing them to negotiate separately with each association and collect a donation fee of one dime per person when collecting membership fees from each labor union to provide relief to the striking workers of the French Concession Water and Electricity Union. In addition to sending a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau for reference, they should be informed, etc. After receiving the approval, the support association immediately raised shares and actively solicited donations.</p>
<p>Shao Ziying Reports: Shao Ziying went to the union yesterday morning to defend himself against the destruction of the labor movement and flattering the capitalists, and asked the union to conduct a strict investigation. If the facts are true, he is willing to accept the spittle of all workers.</p>
<p>Vehicle Affairs Meeting: The workers of the vehicle affairs department held a meeting yesterday, chaired by Wang Jun. Because the work has been complicated recently, six external staff members were publicly elected to carry out all affairs, namely: Xie Xinyu and Gu Peizhi as consultants, Mao Jinquan and Zhao Chunfang as inspectors, and Shen Chunfu and Chen Youjie for transportation. It was also resolved that (1) Those inspectors and ticket writers of Numbers 2 and 5 and other outdoor workers who have not yet reported should be gathered by various means. (2) The outdoor Numbers 3 and 23 ticket inspectors who continue to work in the factory after joining the union are obviously undermining the labor movement and should be warned to report to the meeting within a time limit, otherwise they will be dealt with uniformly. (3) It was decided to promote □□ (illegible) to organize the vehicle affairs, driving and ticketing sections in order to promote unity.</p>
<p>Staff Meeting: Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., more than 180 staff members held a meeting, chaired by Xing Wenrong. It was resolved that (1) In accordance with the resolution of the general meeting, the association will send a letter to the comprador, requiring the staff to resign from their positions and report to the meeting within three days, otherwise appropriate measures will be taken. (2) If any staff members join the strike and still go to the company to work, they should be dealt with severely as a warning to others. (3) Those who have not yet submitted donations should be collected by the team leaders as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Strike Committee Resolves Important Cases: The French Concession Water and Electricity Union held a strike committee meeting yesterday morning at 10 a.m. Chairman Feng Zhiming first reported (omitted). Subsequently, the following was discussed: (1) Shao Ziying has already joined the strike and has been certified by loyal workers as not being a lackey, please review the case. It was decided to consult the support association to review and withdraw the reply. (1) Regarding the lawsuit against Chen Maolin for a check of 1,000 yuan, Chen Maolin is now requesting lawyer Chen Ruilin to come forward and claim that the money is currently deposited in the Siming Bank, but cannot be transferred until January of next year, and all litigation costs should be borne by the association. How should it be handled? It was decided to ignore it and let the law resolve it. (1) Regarding the expansion of the transportation team, it was decided to expand it immediately and send a team to serve the support association. (1) Regarding the release of arrested workers, it was decided to send a letter to the Chinese directors and the legal community to seek relief.</p>
<p>Accurate Number of Strikers: The association had already listed the number of strikers at 1,200 yesterday. After a detailed investigation, the number of original staff and workers working in the factory and the number of people who have now joined the strike are listed separately below: (1) Of the more than 700 workers in the machine affairs department, all have gone on strike. (2) Of the 240 vehicle affairs department drivers, 180 have joined the strike. Of the original 350 ticket sellers, 300 have joined the strike. Of the original 92 outdoor inspectors, ticket inspectors, and ticket writers, 82 have joined the strike. (3) Of the original 200 company staff, 570 have now joined the strike. Combining the above figures, there are approximately 1,600 staff and workers serving the water and electricity company, and 1,430 have now joined the strike front. It is heard that there are still many people rushing to report, it is said.</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Sends Telegram: The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating: "To Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in the Capital: Since the outbreak of the labor strike at the French Concession Water and Electricity Company, the company has not known how to eliminate the crisis in an honest manner, but has been trying to expand the situation. This is not only betting the reputation and business of the French company on a single stake, but also endangering local safety. If unfortunate events occur during this period, causing unexpected suffering to the people, the company should be absolutely responsible. Moreover, the company earns millions in surplus every year, and is willing to use a small portion of the surplus to control the lives of workers, causing hundreds of thousands of citizens who rely on the French Concession for their livelihood to live in constant fear. The French Concession authorities, which have the ability to stop this, have hardly taken any measures to eliminate it, which is difficult to understand. Therefore, it is said that the French Concession Water and Electricity Company has the support of the Paris headquarters, and although it absolutely uses monopoly methods to deal with the Chinese, no one will come forward to uphold justice. Their words are not false. Although the French Concession police have been exceptionally strict in their defenses recently, the company has maintained a calm attitude, and the cost of these defenses is considerable, which will likely be borne by municipal expenses in the future, adding another unnecessary burden on our citizens. How can we remain silent? It is also reported that the French Concession Water and Electricity Company, since obtaining the patent rights, has set water and electricity rates higher than any other water and electricity company, especially water rates. It is now found that the population of the French Concession has increased from less than 100,000 to more than 400,000, and the company's operating income has also increased year by year. This association has repeatedly stated that the company should reduce and equalize water and electricity prices, but it has turned a deaf ear. However, public utilities should be based on the public interest and should not be controlled by a single monopolistic company. If this monopoly continues, our civic groups must rise up and demand correction, and if necessary, propose to the local government to take it back to comply with the principles of public utilities. In addition to sending a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government to raise questions nearby, we are specially telegraphing your department to negotiate with the French Ambassador in order to resolve the situation quickly and calm people's minds (omitted). Chairman Cheng Zhusun and Shang Mu Jiang of the Shanghai French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, respectfully inquire."</p>

<p>Instructions from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city received a consultation from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday, stating that the use of the lunar calendar was banned long ago, but various stores in Shanghai still use the lunar calendar festivals as the standard for hiring and firing employees, disregarding the law. Please instruct the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to inform all businesses and factories that they must adhere to the Gregorian calendar for hiring and firing employees and must not continue to use the lunar calendar, otherwise it will not be effective. The Municipal Government approved the consultation and has already instructed that letters be sent to ensure compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Workers at the Yingchang Factory Went on Strike Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Tong Zhaosan, a worker in the topping room of the Shanghai Yingchang Factory of the Great China Match Company in Lujiazui, Pudong, was frequently taking leave recently. When he asked for leave again yesterday morning between 8 and 9 a.m., he was not approved. Tong could not help but express his dissatisfaction and was fired by the factory. The workers in the room were indignant and suddenly made a commotion. At the same time, workers in other rooms heard the news and responded, leading to a factory-wide strike. The workers then closed the east and west gates tightly, preventing all factory staff from leaving and without food. However, the workers gathered in the factory and maintained order. The factory union reported the incident to the local 5th District Party Department, which sent personnel to mediate. The workers also raised the issue of providing adequate severance pay to the dismissed workers, demanding the factory's acknowledgement. One issue turned into two, and no resolution was reached. Shortly after, representatives from the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau successively sent representatives to the factory to mediate. In the afternoon at 5 p.m., the Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent Inspector Zhang to Pudong to investigate for review and handling. However, as of 7 p.m. last night, the factory gates were still guarded by workers, preventing others from entering or leaving, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Municipal Propaganda Department Issues an Expanded Meeting Declaration <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>A Declaration from the Municipal Propaganda Department to Comrades states: "Comrades, the rebellious gang in the north is now gathered together, hearing about some expanded meeting. Speaking of the expanded meeting, it makes people's teeth itch. They claim to be the Central Party Department, calling themselves Central Committee members, usurping the name and title in Huiren Hall in Beiping, shamelessly seeking favor and advancement, yet glorifying it with the name of the Central Expanded Meeting. Those so-called representatives, claiming to have thirty people attending, actually only have eleven people, and among those eleven people, several are traitors whose qualifications as Central Committee members have long been revoked, and some are simply lower-class politicians who have nothing to do with the first or second sessions. Imagine what good show these villains can put on together. According to Japanese news, Wang Jingwei has already gone north. The first seat at the expanded meeting seems to be available for him to occupy. Of course, he can slightly satisfy his desire for leadership by feasting his eyes on the butcher's shop, but there is also a powerful Yan Xishan in front of him, forcing him to surrender. However, he still wants to make a loud noise. His method of going against the tide will ultimately not escape the trap of being manipulated by force. This kind of self-destruction will further accelerate its speed. In his wonderful article 'The Necessity of the Expanded Meeting of the Central Party Department,' he concealed his ugliness by repeating the same words in the following three paragraphs: First, 'We must take on the responsibility alone and find some suitable people to share the responsibility together.' Second, 'At this critical moment of survival, the remaining Central Committee members have no funds or resources, they can only take on the responsibility alone and find some suitable people to share the responsibility together.' Third, 'The original intention of the Expanded Meeting of the Central Party Department is to find some suitable people to share the responsibility together.' He really couldn't say anything reasonable about the expanded meeting, so he could only repeat the phrase 'find some suitable people' three times, and it is unknown what the definition of 'suitable' is. It must be someone as vile and shameless as Zhao Pilianshao before they are considered suitable. The phrase 'share the responsibility together' appears three times, and it is unknown what responsibility they want to bear. Perhaps this expanded meeting is nothing more than bearing the responsibility of Chuan'an for Yan. The so-called expanded meeting, composed of the Western Hills faction, the reorganization faction, and many despicable and worthless elements, has no legal basis and is extremely absurd. The people of the country strongly condemn them, and anyone with a brain knows the arrogance of their behavior. The members of the expanded meeting are all hired thugs who serve Yan Feng as adopted sons and grandsons. However, they have to put up a good-sounding facade, shouting slogans about democracy and the party commanding the army, which are deafening, but are actually just 'Yan's method,' just the party creating the army. They criticize the Third Plenary Session for not following the precedent of the Second Session and appointing representatives. Now, the people they claim to be the Central Party Department can designate them directly by Yan Xishan alone without holding a national representative conference. Where is the so-called implementation of the democratic spirit? Where is the so-called rigorous implementation of the party commanding the army? They only see them prostrating themselves before their envoy, their emperor, and their master, so as not to be like stray dogs. Originally, the Western Hills and reorganization factions, which are as incompatible as water and fire, can combine with each other, but in fact they are still fighting fiercely in the dark. Just look at their respective publications to know that they are not compatible. The fact that the two rebellious Yan Feng can tolerate each other is already a ridiculous thing. Moreover, they harbor filth and gather all kinds of evil warlords, bureaucrats, and outcasts expelled from the party in one place, hoping to use the name to resist the Central Government. How can it be said that this is not enough to make the people hate them and make friendly countries laugh at them? Question, has the expanded meeting ever been seen in the party's general charter? This only shows that they have other intentions in betraying the party and harming the country. Their crimes are extremely heinous and they are truly enemies of the people. In short, Yan Feng and Wang Chen Zou Xie hope that the country will be in constant war, that the entire country will become a separatist situation, and that the national revolution will be destroyed to achieve their private ends. The facts are obvious. They are blinded by their interests, their actions are contradictory, and they are so shameless that they want to use the expanded meeting as a cover. Is it not hateful and lamentable that people are so devoid of conscience? Comrades, their days are numbered and they are on the verge of extinction. They are only waiting for this last struggle before they cry out and die suddenly. Comrades, let us not listen to their self-destruction, but quickly rise up and condemn them in unison, lest they bring more calamity to China and make the people suffer. Issued by the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China."</p>

After the new Director Tang took office this time, he immediately sent letters to the Consuls General of the United States and Japan, listing the reasons that the sovereignty of the Municipal Government and the income of the Municipal Treasury were concerned, and should be forwarded to the merchants of each country to comply with the regulations. There has been no definite reply yet. It is heard that the bureau has drafted a second step of measures and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>

<h3 id="e129">National Government Strictly Investigates Red Cross Case <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Ordering the Chairman to Expose the Violent Rioters</p>
<p>Standing Committee Members Responsible for Exercising Powers</p>
<p>During the previous Third General Meeting of Members of the Chinese Red Cross, some malicious elements attempted to control the organization for their own gain, instigating rioters to wield weapons and cause chaos at the meeting, and to smash the general office. The National Government ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to send the Director of the Health Bureau, Hu Hongji, to investigate. After investigation, a report was submitted and suggestions for handling the aftermath were made. Later, the National Government ordered the chairman of the board of directors to expose the violent rioters for legal action. The Health Bureau repeatedly urged the chairman of the board to fully expose the rioters, but he made many excuses. Considering the facts at the time and his legal status, and the fact that Chairman Wang attended every meeting and obeyed every order, he could not shirk his responsibility for providing evidence. He was still urged to quickly make the exposure, but he still procrastinated. The progress of the supervision was reported and submitted to the Municipal Government for instructions, which were forwarded to the National Government. The National Government ordered that the City Government should still be responsible for ordering a speedy exposure and strict supervision, without any leniency. Previously, it was stated that Jiang Qudan should be ordered to cease his duties as a standing committee member because he was considered the initiator of the riot. The City Government should thoroughly investigate and report. As for the handling of the aftermath in the previous report, items two, four, five, and six should be followed by the Municipal Government. Item three should be notified by the Standing Committee for compliance. The Municipal Government has ordered the Health Bureau to comply and report back after thorough implementation. The Municipal Health Bureau sent a letter to the Standing Committee of the association, stating briefly that, in addition to the matter of exposing the rioters who committed violence and created chaos, the chairman, Wang Peiyuan, had already been re-urged to be responsible for the exposure in accordance with the previous orders. Another letter was sent to the assets committee member Huang Hanqi to forward to all committee members to investigate and create a property catalog and expense income and expenditure calculations for separate reporting. A corresponding letter was also sent to your association (1) Immediately convene a meeting to discuss and determine the election rules for standing committee members and the rules of procedure for the members' congress, and other regulations. (2) Immediately notify the branches of the Red Cross by the Standing Committee to convene branch members' congresses to nominate representatives to attend the temporary members' congress on schedule (should be notified separately by telegram or registered mail for verification). Branch representatives must bring official letters bearing the branch's seal when attending. (3) Notify the Red Cross General Office to prepare all the procedures for the temporary members' congress in accordance with general meeting procedures and established regulations, so as to avoid further complications. (5) Before the temporary congress is convened, the current standing committee members, Jiang Qudan, should immediately cease his duties as a standing committee member. It is hoped that you will investigate and handle separately and reply for reporting. Another letter was sent to the Chairman, saying (above omitted) Regarding the exposure of the rioters who wielded weapons to cause chaos at the Third Members' Congress of the Red Cross and smashed the Red Cross General Office, the National Government again ordered that you be ordered to urge the chairman of the board to expose them quickly, and ordered strict supervision without any leniency. A special letter is hereby sent to you, hoping that you will investigate and fully expose within five days of receiving this letter for forwarding to the examination and handling. Otherwise, you will have to truthfully report and request the final sanction. Please do not procrastinate again. And separate letters were sent to the President and Vice President of the Red Cross for review and to the Assets Committee for review. The original letters requesting investigation of assets are omitted here. Now, the five opinions approved by the National Government for the aftermath of the association are excerpted as follows: Item 1: Electing standing committee members is an important event for members to exercise their rights. Election rules should be established and there must be certain procedures in place for deliberations to avoid unnecessary disputes. The detailed rules of procedure should also be formulated quickly for common adherence and to prevent disputes. The current standing committee members should be held responsible for formulating various rules in accordance with Article 31, Paragraph 4 of the association's articles of association, and submit the detailed rules of procedure and election rules for standing committee members for verification and filing, so that they can be used as a reference when convening the members' congress in the future. Item 4: Notify the Red Cross President's Office that all procedures for the temporary congress of members must be prepared in accordance with general practice and the association's various regulations to avoid further incidents.

<p>Chinese Goods Only Loaded on Chinese Merchant Ships</p>
<p>Large Sums of Money Transported to Hong Kong</p>
<p>No Foreign Ships Loaded Yesterday, a certain shipping company in this port received a telegram from Xiamen stating that the route from Shanghai to Xiamen and Hong Kong has recently been monopolized by foreign merchants, and they have adopted high-pressure tactics for Chinese merchants' passengers and goods, with little accommodation. The various merchant guilds in Xiamen now have extremely bad feelings with the various foreign shipping companies, and it has been decided that Chinese goods will automatically stop loading on foreign merchant ships in an invisible way.</p>
<p>Gold Awaiting Shipment to Shanghai Since the implementation of the ban on the export of gold, customs has strictly inspected ships leaving for Japan and other ports, resulting in fewer outflows of gold from Shanghai recently. Xiamen currently has a large batch of gold. According to a telegram, there are as many as 3,000 boxes urgently needing to be transported to Hong Kong for re-export overseas. The route has not been specified, but because the transshipment export is unwilling to entrust foreign ships to load, a ship is specially requested to be sent from Shanghai for transportation. Please restore the Chinese shipping route from Shanghai, Xiamen, and Hong Kong. There were originally three regular Chinese ships on this route, but they have been suspended for a long time due to the current situation. The business on this route has been entirely taken over by foreign British and Japanese shipping companies. Now, the various merchant guilds in Xiamen have telegraphed the Shanghai Chinese Shipping Company to restore the South Sea route to meet passenger needs, and have requested that a ship be sent first within the next day or two. Yesterday, it was heard that one Chinese ship would be allowed to resume service from next week.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council held a board meeting on Wednesday (23rd) to discuss various cases, the more important of which included the publication of the Chinese Municipal Council Gazette and the addition of primary schools in the Western District. Regarding the publication of the Chinese Gazette, the board accepted the proposal of the Chinese directors that the Chinese Taxpayers' Association should be entrusted with the appointment of representatives in the future, and the expenses would be paid by the Municipal Council. As for the sections mentioned by the Director-General of the Municipal Council that translators would need to be added and office space would need to be increased in the future, it was decided that they would be submitted to Clerk for preparing a concrete plan and would be proposed for discussion when the board meeting was convened after the summer vacation. Subsequently, the proposal for the Low-Priced Rice Committee was put forward, and Yuan Ludeng was elected to attend as a representative of the Municipal Council, and it was decided that the Municipal Council would allocate 100,000 yuan for rice purchases. Then, the Chinese directors' proposal that primary schools in the Western District urgently need to be opened, and that No. 84 Avenue Edward VII be temporarily rented for one year before the school buildings are completed for the purpose of opening school was considered. The meeting passed, but it must wait for the Bureau of Works and the Fire Department to send personnel to inspect whether the houses are suitable for school buildings before a final decision can be made.</p>

<p>Warning Shops to Add Stamp Duty</p>
<p>The two commissioners of the French Concession Stamp Duty Office, Liu Chunpu and Shen Rulin, previously found that twelve shops, including Lao Qinghe Silver Store, in the French Concession did not affix stamp duty to their invoices, so they were reported by the General Office and sent to the French General Patrol Room. Considering that it was the first offense, the patrol room sent police officers to warn each household. Yong Tai Xiang Department Store, Xie Da Xiang Foreign Goods Store, Hong Shun Tai Tea Store, De Kang Xing Ji Ying Goods Store, and Tian Fu Run Socks Factory were also summoned by the French Concession Police for not affixing stamp duty to their invoices and were severely reprimanded, and ordered to affix all items that should be affixed with stamp duty within two days. Otherwise, they would be sent to the public office for interrogation. The shops have all formally sent letters to Liu Chunpu and Shen Rulin, the two commissioners of the French Concession Stamp Duty Office, to beg for forgiveness, and the shops have separately purchased stamp duty. The other shops have also heard the news and have rushed to the French Concession Stamp Duty Office to purchase and affix them.</p>

It was reported yesterday. It is now known that bank silver goods mortgages are common occurrences. Rice and grains are also goods, and of course there are mortgage situations. However, this is in response to the request of rice merchants to temporarily borrow money, and there is no idea of hoarding for profit. Since the silver industry is being investigated by the Bureau of Social Affairs, it will naturally find ways to restrict it. On the one hand, it will engage in investigating the quantity. After discussing the quantity at the regular meeting in the next two days, it will be replied to the Bureau of Social Affairs for verification.</p>

<p>Arriving in the Next Few Days</p>
<p>Our country has always lacked police officers. In order to train senior police officers, the Ministry of Internal Affairs specially sent police students to study in Japan this spring, stipulating an annual fee of 33,000 yuan. However, due to the soaring price of gold, the original amount allocated was insufficient, and the internal economy was also poor, so it was impossible to maintain the lives of the students in Japan. Moreover, because the students sent did not know Japanese, the benefits obtained were very few. Now, the Executive Yuan has approved the Ministry of Finance to allocate 2,000 yuan for travel expenses and ordered all students in Japan to return home. The travel expenses have been remitted by Wang Rongbao, the Chinese ambassador to Japan, for the students to collect. It is now known that the group of more than 30 people has departed from Japan and is expected to arrive in port in the next few days to report to Beijing and wait for internal arrangements.</p>

<p>In the case of the dancer Huang Baiying being forced to take poison by Tong Sanmao, after the Special District Local Court sentenced Tong to two years in prison, it temporarily came to an end. The drama industry believes that the plot of this case is very tortuous. At first, it was romantic and unrestrained, and then the love sea was surging, creating a love triangle, which was extremely sad. Shanghai stage sought to be one step ahead and paid attention to collecting all the materials at the beginning of the case. When Tong Sanmao was convicted, it did not wait for its confirmation and published the advertisement that the stage would perform the play in the newspaper, naming it Tong Sanmao and a Certain Dancer, and choosing to premiere on the evening of the 26th. However, Tong deeply unwilling that his romantic affairs would be spread by the actors, he specially hired the two lawyers who defended him, Liu Shifang and Zou Yu, to petition the Special District Court on the 25th to issue an order to prohibit the stage from performing. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Li Zhishan also visited Yang Zhaoyun, the president of the court, to ask whether the Shanghai stage's arrangement of this play could be approved for performance. President Yang's expressions to Lawyer Li were generally that, although the first instance of this case has been judged, Tong is still dissatisfied and is appealing. Tong's crime has not yet reached the final confirmation period. At this time, it should not be set to music. Moreover, once it is dyed with rouge and powder and performed on stage, it will not be without impact on Tong's private ethics. Now Tong has hired a lawyer to petition for an order to prohibit it, which is of course approved and enforced. The police cannot ignore this issue, and Lawyer Li then applied for a prohibition on behalf of the police. The court drafted an injunction yesterday afternoon ordering Police Officer Ji Geng to go to Shanghai Stage to order the stage not to perform the play Tong Sanmao and a Certain Dancer.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Misunderstanding Erupts into Conflict Between Wusong Land and Water Police <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Fortunately, the Storm Did Not Widen</p>
<p>Both Sides are Willing to Peace</p>
<p>Zheng Zhichuan, a patrolman from the First Police Station of the Seventh District of the Wusong West City Public Security Bureau, was on duty at the entrance of Letian Teahouse on Waimalu at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. He saw a fisherman carrying a large bundle of fishing nets passing by. The patrolman, fearing that there were smuggled items inside, ordered him to put down the nets for inspection. At that time, several plainclothes water police officers from the Third Platoon of the 16th Team of the 4th District of the Water Police and passers-by stepped forward to watch. The patrolman, fearing that it would hinder traffic, stopped the audience, which led to a conflict with the water police. Then, the water police forced the patrolman to go on board to argue. Because the Third Platoon's gunboat was anchored below Tongxing Wharf, the patrolman had no choice but to follow the crowd on board. Unexpectedly, several patrolmen on shift change were coming from west to east and had not reached Tongxing Wharf. They mistakenly heard from passers-by that the patrolman had been dragged away and beaten by the water police, so the police, upon hearing this, loaded their bullets and rushed to the boat. The water police also moved a small steel cannon installed on the bow of the boat in preparation for resistance. The situation was tense for a while, as if facing a great enemy. The audience crowded around and was panicked when they saw this situation. When the police on shift change arrived at the scene, they saw Zheng Zhichuan sitting on the deck of the boat, and the water police had no fierce actions, so they did not open fire, and the storm did not widen. Later, Wu Dongchen, the platoon leader of the Third Platoon, arrived on the boat after hearing the news and learned about the cause of the incident. Zhang Jiguang, the director of the First Police Station of the Seventh District, also rushed to the scene at that time. Director Zhang and Platoon Leader Wu went to the Seventh District together to explain the situation of the misunderstanding by District Chief Yang Maorong. The officials on both sides were willing to settle the matter peacefully, so they sent the patrolmen on the boat back to the First Police Station of the Seventh District. A conflict between the land and water police came to an end.</p>

<p>Accomplice Ge Dahu Sent for Trial First</p>
<p>Li Hongkai, a 49-year-old man from Yangzhou residing in Xicaofang, Gonghe New Road, Zhabei, works as a laborer at the telephone company. He has a son named Qimen who is violent and often argues with his father. Li, out of love for his son, endures it. Last winter, he even married him to the daughter of Lu Hongde, who lives nearby. Although the couple's relationship is strong, Qimen has become increasingly distant from Li. Recently, Qimen, encouraged by his father-in-law, insisted on separating from his father. However, Li had hoped that after marrying a wife, he would have someone to serve him and enjoy his old age. He did not expect things to turn out this way, so he was extremely angry. The night before, he slightly rebuked Qimen, who suddenly turned around, took out a sharp blade about three feet long, and, together with his friend Ge Dahu, pushed his father to the ground and stabbed him repeatedly in several places. Li cried out for help in extreme pain. Neighbors heard the sound and gathered. Qimen, seeing that he had caused a disaster, fled. The police also arrived and found Li lying in a pool of blood, barely breathing. They immediately took him to the hospital for treatment and arrested the accomplice Ge Dahu, who was sent to the Fourth District Headquarters. During the preliminary hearing by Director Jin, Ge denied being an accomplice. Because the case involved parricide and Li Hongkai's life was uncertain, Director Jin ordered that Ge be sent to the Bureau for further investigation and ordered detectives to arrest Li Qimen, who was on the run, for interrogation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Li Hongkai claimed that his son's attack was instigated by his father-in-law, Lu Hongde. The District Chief ordered that both Li Qimen, who was on the run, and his father-in-law, Lu Hongde, be arrested and brought to justice.</p>

The petition stated that the plaintiff, now 32 years old, was married to the defendant at the age of 23 on the 11th day of the first month through her parents' arrangement and a matchmaker's words. In the autumn of that year, her husband had an affair and arbitrarily mistreated her, disregarding her interests. She was forced to temporarily return to her mother's home, hoping that the defendant would reform. However, the defendant preferred the new over the old. In the fourth month of her 24th year, she returned to her husband's home, and in the autumn, she gave birth to a daughter, enduring much hardship and lacking the means to live. In the seventh month after giving birth that year, she returned to her mother's home, where she supported herself and her daughter by working, accumulating debts. The defendant treated the plaintiff like a stranger. According to the precedents of (Seventeenth Year, Upper, Tenth Month) Re-examination (Seventeenth Year, Upper, Three) Four Eight), the case is in compliance and requests to be granted a divorce. The defendant, Wang Shulin, also hired lawyer Gong Yingxuan to respond and filed a counterclaim requesting cohabitation, stating that the plaintiff came to his house at the age of ten as a child bride. At the age of sixteen, she returned to her mother's home. In the tenth year of the Republic, she was formally welcomed into his home with proper ceremonies. The following year, she gave birth to a daughter, Agou, who is now nine years old. Because his house and the plaintiff's mother's house are very close, the plaintiff often stayed at her mother's house or worked at a factory. Initially, the plaintiff returned home once every one or two months of the year. He repeatedly went to pick her up before she returned, but she soon returned to her mother's house. In April of last year, after the plaintiff returned to Ning, she refused to return to his home and demanded that he live at her mother's house. In order to maintain their marital love, he had no choice but to allow her request to move their bed, boxes, and clothing to his in-laws' house, hoping to spend the rest of their lives together. Who knew that the plaintiff had deceitful intentions? After he moved the furniture and other items to his in-laws' house, the plaintiff went out and could not be found after repeated searches. He had no choice but to return to his own home in July of last year. Now, he suddenly received a notice from the court stating that he had abandoned his wife, committed adultery, and failed to fulfill his duties as a husband, leading to a request for divorce. He would like to address it simply: the so-called abandonment of a wife must have the fact of abandonment. The so-called adultery must also have the fact of adultery. Now, he asks, what kind of evidence does the plaintiff have to prove the above two facts to suddenly request a divorce? Therefore, he legally files a counterclaim requesting the rejection of the plaintiff's lawsuit and ordering cohabitation to maintain morality. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Keqian opened the court to hear the case. The defendant did not appear due to business and requested a postponement. Only the plaintiff appeared. After the interrogator briefly questioned her, he ordered that the defendant had not appeared today and that another hearing would be scheduled.</p>

<p>Two Boatmen Killed</p>
<p>Boat Owner Jiang Kidnapped</p>
<p>The sandboat Wu Changtai, belonging to the Northern Shipping Line, loaded 800 pieces of broad beans and 1,000 stones of yellow beans in Niuzhuang Yingkou. On the 20th of this month, while sailing on the sea off Zhoushan, it was suddenly attacked by two pirate ships. The pirate ships, with their sails unfurled, opened fire. Chen, one of the Wu boat's crew, was knocked down. The other crew members, seeing this, panicked and tried to turn the rudder to retreat and avoid danger. However, the two pirate ships pursued them for more than ten miles, firing along the way. The boat was riddled with holes, but they were still caught. The pirates boarded the ship with guns and opened fire randomly, killing two crew members and injuring five or six. The pirates swarmed into the cabin of boat owner Jiang, searched it, and pulled him out from under the bed. They forced him to hand over silver dollars, but he refused and was beaten and injured by the pirates. The pirates searched everyone on board and stole all the silver dollars. Before leaving, they kidnapped boat owner Jiang to the pirate ship and told the Wu boat's crew that they would have to prepare 5,000 yuan to redeem him. The two pirate ships sailed towards the East Sea. The Wu boat is now anchored in Liuhe. The killed crew members have been placed in coffins and prepared for burial, and the injured crew members have been sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday, the helmsman of the boat came to Shanghai to report the incident. All the cargo owners are requesting that measures be taken to rescue boat owner Jiang. The cargo owners have jointly sent a telegram to the Foreign Water Police to apprehend the pirates.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Lu and Tang Both Willing to Divorce <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>They Went to Court to Request a Settlement Record</p>
<p>Tang Lan Ying (formerly Lu Tang's), a woman from Zaoning, hired someone to draft a petition to the local court requesting a divorce. The content of her petition stated that the defendant Lu Daocheng is often sick and unable to support the plaintiff, which is the main reason for the divorce. She also stated that she is 25 years old and has been married since she was 19. She has a daughter named Gendi who is six years old. Starting in February of this year, the couple began to quarrel because the defendant was plagued by illness and could not earn money to support the family. Now, both parties have agreed to divorce. The plaintiff will pay the defendant 200 yuan, and the six-year-old daughter, Gendi, will be raised by the defendant. They will sever their marital relationship to avoid future disputes. Therefore, she requests that legal procedures be followed to avoid complications. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao Zhenhai specially opened the Ninth Court to hear the case. The plaintiff, Tang Lan Ying, stated the previous circumstances and said that she would now pay him back 200 yuan in wedding gifts and that they had already agreed to separate. She also said that both parties were willing. She just mentioned that the money had not yet been paid. The defendant, Lu Daocheng, testified that he was 25 years old, from Funing, and lived at 224 Guangzhao Road, Zhabei. The official asked, "Have you agreed to divorce?" He replied, "Yes, but the agreement has not been written." He also asked, "Are you requesting that a settlement record be written in court?" He replied, "Because we were afraid of problems if we settled outside, we came to the court to request it." Judge Zhao obtained his testimony and prepared the settlement record, granting the divorce and ordering both parties to sign it to establish the settlement. Thus, they separated and left the court.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, at around 10:00 AM, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Belles in the French Concession, a prisoner transport vehicle of the French police traveling from west to east hit a child of about eleven or twelve years old traveling from north to south, because the child was unable to avoid it.

<h3 id="e150">The Whole Story of the Wusong Police Department's Handling of the Case of the Woman Who Jumped into the River <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>District Officer Xu Removed from Office Due to the Case</p>
<p>District Chief Yang Reprimanded by Order</p>
<p>Director Yuan Issued a Circular Notice</p>
<p>District Chief Yang Maorong of the Seventh District of Wusong was impeached by District Officer Xu Tao because of the incident of rescuing the female student Wang Yingying who jumped into the river. Now, District Officer Xu has been dismissed by Director Yuan. Now, we excerpt the instructions from the Municipal Public Security Bureau regarding this case and the full text of District Chief Yang's reply as follows. Instructions Director Yuan's instructions to the entire bureau stated: It is hereby ordered to notify things. According to the report from District Officer Xu Tao of the Seventh District, the district chief took photos with the woman who jumped into the river and issued illegal orders. The Inspectorate was immediately dispatched</p>
<h3 id="e151">District Chief Yang and Ms. Wang Take a Photo Together <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>to instruct Inspector Liao Chengzhang to investigate and report the matter. It was reported that after being dispatched, he rushed to the Wusong Seventh District Office and inquired with patrol officer Gao Yukui, who claimed that at 1:00 PM on June 19, the duty officer of the Dalu Shipping Company in Paotaiwan saw a young female student running towards the riverbank near the customs flag room, with tears on her face, about to jump into the river. Because of her unusual appearance, he rushed to the riverbank and asked her about her origin and address, but she refused to answer. He then took her to the district office and asked the district chief to investigate. After District Chief Yang's own inquiries, she finally revealed that her name was Wang Chuanxiang, 16 years old, also known as Wang Yingying. She was a third-year junior high school graduate of the Aiguo Girls' School. Her father, Wang Dixin, is 41 years old and is currently the deputy director of the Tonghe Bank on Ningbo Road. She also has four siblings and lives at 1319 Ren'an Lane, near Tilanqiao in the Public Concession. After the district chief learned about Wang Yingying's background, he informed her family to claim her and advised her to take a photo as a record to prevent suicidal thoughts. However, the woman feared that it would be published in the newspaper and damage her family's reputation, so she firmly refused. Because Wusong is far away and the district office's residence is not convenient for lodging, he planned to take her to Shanghai and escort her home. At that time, the woman had mostly come to her senses, but he was afraid that she would not be sincere, so he suggested taking another photo as a souvenir. The woman happily agreed. The district chief then took her to Shanghai and went directly to Guanzhen Photo Studio on Nanjing Road to take a six-inch photo. The woman believed that taking a photo with two people would not lead to it being published in the newspaper, so she posed calmly without any reluctance. She was as innocent as could be. After taking the photo, they went to the district chief's house, where she was accompanied by Miss Yang and one of her friends. He then sent someone to Tilanqiao to inform Wang's family. However, her family was out. The next day, he met Wang Dixin at the Tonghe Bank and asked him to pick her up immediately. Wang expressed his gratitude, but because his family education was very strict, he had to report to his father before picking her up. The next morning, District Chief Yang went to meet Wang's father, who was overjoyed to find his beloved granddaughter, who had gone missing due to suicidal thoughts. He immediately ordered his son, Wang Dixin, to pick her up and wrote a letter of thanks on file. Therefore, the handling of Wang Yingying's suicide attempt was entirely appropriate, except that some of the procedures were slightly out of order. The photo was printed and sent directly to the Seventh District Office for safekeeping, which proves that there was no secret intention. As for the ice cream tasting at Ya Xiang Room on Hongyuan Road, inquiries with the store clerk showed that there was still a deposit of one yuan and several cents. As for the incident of the Taoist priest Ma Buyun at 125 Fenglu Road cursing A Mulin, patrol chief Jiang Zhixiu was ordered to go and warn the family to discipline them. The section chief also said that it was true. As for the reactionary slogans written in white powder on the telephone pole in Paotaiwan, as stated in the original letter, inquiries with patrol chief He Xixing revealed that it was just a joke and not a strict order to be enforced. After checking the reports, it was found that the district chief, in order to prevent the woman from having suicidal thoughts again, advised her to take a photo as a record and, to avoid her fearing that it would be published in the newspaper, proposed taking a photo with her as a souvenir. He then took her to his house, where she was accompanied by a woman, and notified her family to pick her up. It was observed that his concern and protection were solely because the woman felt emotionally stimulated by her family and was too narrow-minded. He hoped to calm her momentary anger in order to achieve the ultimate goal of safety. His intention was not bad. The fact that the photo was sent to the district office for filing and that the family wrote a letter of thanks is sufficient proof that he had no secret motives. However, because the district office is a place where eyes are gathered, it should be handled according to legal procedures. The district chief's over-accommodation was akin to a benevolent old woman and was oblivious to the responsibilities of an official. Suspicion arose from avoiding suspicion in a melon patch and wind in an empty cave. Furthermore, his failure to report the case immediately was improper and difficult to excuse. However, considering that it stemmed from love and care, he was leniently reprimanded. The district is a model for all sections and is expected to proceed step by step and be prudent in handling matters. District Officer Xu Tao is a senior official of the district and is responsible for assisting the district chief in handling district affairs. If the district chief has any shortcomings, he may point them out clearly to jointly maintain district affairs. However, he did not make any statement at the time and instead picked up floating rumors after the fact and hastily filed a complaint. Furthermore, his investigation did not delve into the underlying meaning and was often inconsistent with the facts. He even included trivial matters to exaggerate and sensationalize, such as the ice cream matter. It was found that there was still a deposit at the store, which proves that it was not free food. As for the statement of arresting people who write reactionary slogans and executing them on the spot, it was an occasional joke and not a formal order, so it should not be used as evidence. All kinds of fabrications are close to intentionally attacking the superior. This kind of hasty competition is absolutely not allowed. It was also found that the officer distributed invitation cards and collected money at gatherings in the district, which is greedy, absurd, and violates police regulations. District Officer Xu Tao of the Seventh District is hereby removed from office pending investigation. In addition to ordering compliance, it is also ordered to notify this. Order.</p>
<p>Reply District Chief Yang's reply states: A report is submitted for the district officer's inviting guests and collecting money. I respectfully submit the real situation for inspection and decision. I respectfully received a verbal order instructing me to investigate the district officer Xu Tao's inviting guests and collecting money and to report the details of the real situation, etc. I investigated and found that this case occurred on the 8th of this month. Previously, when the officer was acting as district chief, he misappropriated 144 yuan for the petitioning police, 84.86 yuan for the district chief's absence, and about 20 yuan in miscellaneous expenses from the long-term police fund, totaling more than 300 yuan. I urged him to hand it over to the bureau, but he was unable to comply. He asked me to give him some time to find a way to raise the money. Therefore, the officer pleaded with Zheng Shushan, the vice president of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, to find a way to make up for it. Zheng thought the amount was too large to handle alone, so he asked him to invite Zhang Yuchi, Yang Yuankang, Tang Zan's, a member of the Municipal Council, and Xu Xigen, the owner of various customs declaration firms, and other members of the Chamber of Commerce, a total of 18 people, to pay 20 yuan each for a lunch at the Seashore Hotel on the 8th of this month. They all arrived on time and spent 49.55 yuan. After calculating the cost at 80%, Zheng signed on behalf of the officer for 39.64 yuan to pay the price. At that time, there was no money to pay, so the officer only gave 2 yuan in small change to disperse them. This is the process of inviting guests and collecting money that day. After the guests at the table left, there was much dissatisfaction with the officer's actions. Because he had not been in office for long and the local area had not benefited from him, it was unreasonable to suffer this meaningless loss. Soon, I heard about this and should investigate the real situation in detail for reporting and handling. I asked Zheng Shushan in person about the origin and details, who said that the district officer did need help because he was short of public funds. He would collect 360 yuan the next day to help him and repeatedly asked me not to report it to avoid being condemned. I believed that public funds should not be shortchanged and that the measures taken were improper and that the compensation was worrying. I immediately urged the officer to hand over the public funds and reported the situation truthfully after he obtained the receipt from the general office. This is the real situation of my investigation of the officer's inviting guests and collecting money and urging him to hand over the public funds without immediately reporting it. I respectfully submit the real situation for inspection and decision in accordance with the previous instructions. I respectfully present this to Director Yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Conducts Periodic Inspections of Public Buses <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The First Phase Has Ended</p>
<p>The Second Phase Will Be Held Soon</p>
<p>The number of public buses in the city is gradually increasing, and their use is becoming more frequent. Because their size is larger than ordinary cars and they carry more passengers, traffic safety is especially important. In view of this, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau formulated a method for periodic inspection of public buses in May of this year, stipulating that one phase is two months, with six phases throughout the year. Forms are prepared in advance and companies are ordered to distribute the vehicles evenly and submit them for inspection. Since June 1, technicians Lu Shouxia and Wu Jinhai have been assigned to the Huashang and Hunan public bus companies to implement the first phase of inspection, which has now ended. The assembly of the entire vehicle, the internal machinery, and the external appearance, etc., are divided into a total of 54 items and are subject to meticulous inspection. The Huashang Company has 20 vehicles, of which 3 are under repair. The Hunan Company has 37 vehicles, of which 10 are under repair and are still awaiting re-inspection. It is said that the inspection results show that the Huashang Company's vehicles are superior to the Hunan Company's vehicles in terms of form and machinery, which proves that the two companies pay attention to the vehicles they own, while the other inevitably neglects them. It is said that the bureau is now scheduled to hold the second phase of inspection starting on August 1. It is expected that the two companies will compete because of the comparison and will strive to improve the vehicles to avoid citizens having the feeling that public buses within the same city range are of different quality.</p>

<p>Wang Shanan and Others Sentenced to One Year and Two Months of Imprisonment Each</p>
<p>Wang Shanan from Nanjing, Li Xuetian from Qingjiang, and the woman Zha Wenying were all once workers in a yarn factory, but they all left the industry in order. Recently, they used the name of rescuing unemployed workers to organize a donation group for the Tongxing Yarn Factory. They went to the factory areas in western Shanghai to see yarn factory workers, regardless of gender, and asked each person to donate one silver dollar. Those who were unwilling to donate were prevented from entering the factory to work. These people had considerable influence, and good people endured their evil and painfully threw their hard-earned money into the empty shell, not daring to argue with them. The day before yesterday afternoon, they forcibly took the female foreman Wang Zhangshi and the worker Zhao Defu of Tongxing to the Xiaochaguan at 204 Yichang Road and forced them to donate one yuan each. They had to pay it. Fortunately, the Puhua Road Police Department heard about it and immediately ordered detective Ma Zonglai and Zhao Fuhai to lead the police to the teahouse to arrest Wang Shanan and the other three men and women. From then on, workers were spared the trouble of extortion. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation by Judge Sun Yuan. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Police Department said that a total of 22 yuan in silver dollars and 55 cents in small coins were found on Wang Shanan's person. He admitted to the police that they were all obtained through extortion and presented the silver and small coins, as well as a donation book No. 3 and a blank receipt, etc. The extorted Wang Zhangshi and others testified that the defendants were tyrannical when they extorted money. Because the evidence was conclusive, the three could not deny it and said that this action was ordered by the General Labor Union. Judge Sun immediately sentenced Wang Shanan, Li Xuetian, and Zha Wenying to one year and two months of imprisonment each for jointly and continuously defrauding and obtaining money. The receipts, letters, account books, wooden stamps, and notebooks were confiscated. The silver coins were also confiscated. However, the one yuan donated by each of the five Zhangshi and Zhao Defu was returned.</p>

<p>Passengers on the Songhu Train Are Greatly Affected</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:20, the Songhu train departed from Paotaiwan and traveled half a li west of the Zhanghuabang station when suddenly more than 20 female workers from the Wusong Yong'an and Hua yarn factories stood outside the tracks and threw stones and mud at the train. Three first-class passengers were injured in the head by stones, and five third-class passengers had their faces and clothes stained with mud. Because the train was traveling at a high speed at the time of the incident, it could not be stopped immediately, and the female workers who caused the trouble completely escaped. An investigation revealed that the female workers all lived in the Zhanghuabang area, far away from the Yunzaobang Yarn Factory, and usually took the train to and from work, but none of them bought tickets. Recently, the train ticket inspectors have been very strict in checking tickets, so the female workers can no longer ride the train for free. Therefore, they harbored great resentment in their hearts and committed this unreasonable act. It is said that similar incidents have occurred more than once in the past few days. After the incident yesterday, the ticket inspector on the train reported it to the Traffic Office, which ordered the traffic police to patrol and guard the section of the track.</p>

<p>The Police Department Refuses to Let It Go</p>
<p>The Yang Family Old Hotel, located at the Old Garbage Bridge, north of the Public Concession's New Swimming Pool, has been in business for many years. The business is managed by the young owner, Yang Qiutang (formerly Yang Qiutao), who often instructs his wife to collect the meal fees at the counter. The night before, Wang Akang, a Shaoxing native (formerly a garbage truck driver, 35 years old), came to the hotel to fill his stomach. After finishing his meal, the bill was calculated to be 460 cash. Wang presented two dimes worth of small silver to the counter to pay. Because each dime was worth 470 cash, after deducting the 460 cash for the meal, he insisted that Yang's wife return one copper coin. However, Yang's wife only agreed to take it as 460 cash and refused to return the coin, which caused a dispute. Wang slammed the counter and said that the hotel was a black shop. Yang Qiutang, who was in the counter, heard this and immediately came out to scold Wang for not being rude and punched Wang hard in the chest. The floor of the hotel was paved with slippery cement, and Wang lost his balance and fell backward, hitting the back of his head and causing a large gash that bled profusely. The owner of the hotel saw that he had caused a disaster and immediately hired a car to take him to Renji Hospital in Hongkou for treatment. He died in the hospital due to his injuries. Yang immediately asked someone to mediate with the family of the deceased and offered to pay generous compensation. The family of the deceased was willing to settle peacefully. However, the responsible police department, after receiving the report, believed that the matter involved a homicide and should be handled carefully. In addition to sending the body to the coroner's office for examination, detectives were dispatched to conduct a thorough investigation for review.</p>

<p>Patrolling by Car</p>
<p>More Than a Dozen People Apprehended</p>
<p>Recently, public concession police authorities have noted that along Avenue Edward VII and Nanjing Road, after 10:00 PM, prostitutes stand on the streets, soliciting passersby. This severely violates regulations and mars public order. These prostitutes also hire thugs to act as lookouts. As soon as they see police officers, they immediately flee, making arrests difficult. Therefore, Chinese and foreign detectives from the police station have, over the past few nights, quietly patrolled by car, moving east to west and west to east, blocking both ends. They arrested more than a dozen prostitutes and took them to the station for questioning and fines. ○ The National Products Department Store Rectifies Operations. Starting Today, Free Entertainment Vouchers Will Be Given Out.</p>
<p>The Chinese National Products Department Store organized a meeting of manufacturer representatives to report to the committee. The first executive committee meeting was held the night before. Wang Hanqiang, Cui Fuzhuang, Fang Jiangge, Xu Yunhui, Jiang Zhonghe, Ruan Jihou, and Sun Guren were elected as standing committee members, taking turns assisting the department store management in handling all matters. Because the Tongle Amusement Park on the second floor previously invited White Russian performers who had been naturalized as Chinese citizens to perform, causing misunderstandings, it was decided to stop their performances and replace them with purely Chinese entertainment. The park has already agreed and voluntarily terminated the previous performances yesterday. In addition, active steps have been taken to improve sanitation and fire safety facilities, making them increasingly perfect. Therefore, the number of visitors has been quite high recently. To show their appreciation to guests, the stores in the department store have decided to give customers a free Tongle Park entertainment voucher starting today (the 27th) to enhance their interest. Today is Sunday, and the department store will remain open as usual.</p>

<p>○ Adultery with Another's Wife and Beating the Husband Wang Qigui is Too Weak; Wang Sibao is Too Fierce</p>
<p>Wang Qigui, a villager from Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, is thirty-three years old and has been farming for a living in his hometown. His wife, Ms. Li, is twenty-nine years old. They have been married for eight years and have one child each. The couple could have lived a hard life together. Last autumn, Ms. Li repeatedly advised her husband to stop his dissolute behavior, but to no avail. As a result, disagreements arose frequently. Later, because she found it difficult to make a living, Ms. Li left her husband and came to Shanghai alone. Because she was unfamiliar with the area, she had nowhere to stay. She happened to meet a fellow villager named Wang Sibao, who seduced her into adultery. For the sake of livelihood, she had no choice but to go along and live with Wang in the Lime Kiln area of Xiaoshadu, West Shanghai, behaving like a married couple. Her husband, Wang Qigui, received a report from someone returning to his hometown that his wife had been seduced. He came to Shanghai this month and found his wife living with Wang Sibao. Wang Sibao, seeing that her husband was weak and easily bullied, did not avoid him and continued to sleep with Ms. Li. Wang Qigui, penniless and without acquaintances in Shanghai, had no choice but to endure and stay in their house. When he wanted to take her back to their hometown, she kept stalling. Yesterday morning around 2:00 AM, Qigui again asked his wife to return home with him the next day. Wang Sibao heard this and became furious, cursing and scolding him. A quarrel broke out, and Wang Sibao punched Qigui, injuring him. The local patrolman heard the commotion and rushed to the scene, taking the three people back to the Sixth District Police Station. After separate interrogations by District Chief Ren, Wang Qigui stated, "My wife, Li, has been seduced by the defendant. Now that I want to take her back, the defendant dares to forcefully refuse and beat me. I request an investigation." Ms. Li and Wang Sibao said, one refusing to return and the other denying any beating. After obtaining the statements, District Chief Ren believed that the case involved adultery with a married woman and the audacity to commit violence. He immediately prepared documents and transferred the case to the court for trial.</p>

<p>Chen Fubao, a thirty-six-year-old from Hangzhou, residing at Xiexing Lane, Xizang Road, British Concession, was in a quarrel at the Pinfang Teahouse on Menggu Road, Zhabei, with Madam Xu, a woman from Nanxiang, and her husband, Xu Wanjin, around 3:30 PM yesterday. He was also allegedly intimidating them. After learning of the incident, policemen from Section One of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau detained Chen and others for questioning. According to Madam Xu, she is thirty years old, residing at No. 72 Chongde Lane, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei. Previously, she worked at the Baokang Silk Factory on Chang'an Road. Chen Fubao repeatedly harassed her, but she strongly refused. Angered by this, Chen sent a letter to her husband, Xu Wanjin, falsely accusing her of having an intimate relationship with him and making various embarrassing statements. Fortunately, her husband was unmoved. Chen sent a total of nine letters, which her husband ignored. This afternoon, Chen suddenly invited her and her husband to a teahouse, and his words were threatening, leading to the police taking them to the station. The defendant, Chen Fubao, gave a statement that was very different from Madam Xu's, claiming that he had been intimate with Madam Li for two years. After hearing the statements, Director Yao believed that Chen Fubao had failed in his attempt to commit adultery and had dared to falsely accuse Madam Xu of being intimate with him. This was extremely hateful. He was sentenced to be sent to the Judicial Section for investigation and prosecution.</p>

<p>Madam Feng Wang Holds Onto Feng Liao</p>
<p>Madam Feng Wang, an old woman from Kunshan, is fifty-one years old. She has a son named A Wu, who is twenty years old. The mother and son have been farming for a living in their hometown. They have been frugal and diligent for many years, saving up some savings. They thought that their son had grown up and were eager to have a grandson. Therefore, two years ago, they asked someone to arrange a marriage with a woman from the Liao family in their village. Madam Liao is twenty-one years old and very beautiful. After entering the family, she saw that her husband was a simpleton from the countryside and that the family was poor. She felt frustrated, and the relationship between the couple became increasingly cold. Because of this, there were often quarrels. She felt that staying there was not a good idea, so last spring she secretly ran away from her husband and came to Shanghai, hiding in the Da Wang Miao Street area of Nanmatou. Since her daughter-in-law disappeared, Madam Feng hired people to search everywhere, but there was no news. Recently, Madam Feng came to Shanghai on business. Around 11:00 PM the night before, while walking along Da Wang Miao Street, she happened to run into her runaway daughter-in-law, Liao. Upon seeing her face, she immediately recognized her and rushed forward to grab her, forcing her to return home. Liao refused to do so. They argued for a long time, unable to resolve the dispute. Madam Feng had no choice but to report to Wu Zhantang, the watchman of Post 22 in the area, who took them back to Section One of the First District Police Station. After a preliminary interrogation by the station chief, he ordered them to be temporarily detained pending investigation and prosecution.</p>

<p>Accidental Error When Throwing a Sandbag</p>
<p>Wang Zigui, Li Ziheng, and Wu Caifa, residing on Beidi Avenue, French Concession, were throwing sandbags in front of their house the night before to practice martial arts. Wang Zigui accidentally missed and threw the sandbag at the lower part of a pedestrian, Liao Rushan, injuring his testicles. He immediately fainted. The patrolmen arrived and arrested Wang and the other two. They sent the injured person to the hospital. Yesterday, after recovering from his injury, the victim was discharged and the patrolmen sent the defendants to the French court. The plaintiff, Liao Rushan, stated that he was from Shandong. He was passing by when the defendants accidentally injured his testicles while throwing sandbags. Although he has recovered, he is still unable to walk. He requested an investigation. Wang Zigui confessed that he had accidentally injured the plaintiff and begged for leniency. Li and Wu both stated that they were playing together but did not injure the plaintiff. Judge Zhu sentenced the first defendant, Wang Zigui, to compensate the plaintiff eighty yuan for medical expenses and ordered him to be released on bail. Li and Wu were released without charge.</p>

A quarrel broke out, resulting in a physical fight. Yin Jintu was hit in the head with a stick, fracturing his skull and covering him in blood. His life is in danger. Zhu Ronghua was also injured in the arm and other places, but not seriously. Lu reported the incident to Section Two of the Sixth District Police Station, who sent the three people, along with Zhu's father, to court yesterday for questioning.</p>

<p>Released on One Thousand Yuan Bail</p>
<p>Qin Zhulin, from Haimen, who runs a rubber business and lives at No. 388 Shanhai Pass Road, had considered the woman in the house next door, Lu Wang, as his foster mother since childhood. This woman was quite wealthy, with ten thousand and eight hundred yuan stored in the bank. In April of the year before last, Qin and his friend Bao Senbai needed funds for their business and asked her to guarantee a line of credit at the Guohua Bank. The woman knew Qin was honest and had a close relationship with him, so she agreed to guarantee three thousand taels. However, this was only a verbal agreement, and she only stamped the guarantee form without filling in the amount. It was not until recently, when the woman went to Guohua to settle her account, that she discovered only a hundred yuan remained in her deposit and interest. Qin had embezzled more than ten thousand and six hundred yuan. She confronted Qin, but Qin was unable to repay the money immediately. She reported this to the Xinzha Police Station, who sent Detective Gao Yanrong to Qin's house at 6:30 AM yesterday to arrest Qin. He was then sent to the Special District Local Court, accused of embezzling the deposit. The plaintiff, Lu Wang, and her son, Lu Sifan, went to court to explain the situation. When questioned, Qin confessed that he had only used about a thousand yuan of the woman's deposit. Most was embezzled by someone surnamed Bao. He is now trying to find a way to repay the money. Judge Sun ordered Qin Zhulin to be released on one thousand yuan bail and adjourned the hearing to another date.</p>

No one was taking him. She took the child back, but since no one had come to claim him by nightfall, she sent the child to the station. The District Chief Ren stated that the boy was about three years old and unable to speak. He could only be temporarily kept at the station for his family to claim him. The child has a round face, is wearing a Buddhist hairstyle, is bare-chested and barefoot, is only wearing old white cotton pants, and is quite fat. He is unable to speak. Judging by his appearance, he seems to be a local.</p>

Therefore, he stole the shark fins as payment. Zhou Dongming stated that he did not know they were stolen, so he dared to accept them. Chinese and foreign judges sentenced Zhang to four months in prison and fined Zhou fifty yuan as a warning.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor: We are writing on behalf of our client, Mrs. Bu Bao, who has stated that she read the news article published in various newspapers on July 18 of this year regarding a married daughter requesting inheritance. The article stated that the plaintiffs were the married daughters of the late Bu Jicheng. After Jicheng's death, his property of more than ten thousand was divided by his brothers Bu Guangxun, Hao Xun, Mingxun, and his stepmother Bu Bao and her son Zhixun. The plaintiffs did not receive any share of the property, so they requested a legal judgment. We were surprised to read this. She is the stepmother of Jicheng, and her status is related to her rights. We are concerned that this will confuse the public. We have requested your lawyer to write a letter to correct the record so that the truth may be revealed. We are sending this letter accordingly and hope that you will investigate and correct the record. We value our friendship. Sincerely, Dong Yu, Lawyer, July 26.</p>
<p>To the Editor: We are writing to request that you correct a statement in your newspaper that the builder of the collapsed building on Jing'an Temple Road was the China Business Company. Our company has not built any buildings in that location. Sincerely, American China Business Company.</p>

<p>New Words on the Melon War</p>
<p>Come Back With Fresh Eyes, Guest</p>
<p>The day before Minor Heat, the heat was sweltering. I suddenly received a small note from my friend Chen Liangcai inviting me to a melon war on Minor Heat. I responded with a few words, saying that it was old-fashioned and tasteless. The next morning, he sent someone to urge me to come quickly by car. Liangcai had not yet gotten up. His wife, Gu Yunbo, greeted me. I saw melons arranged on the ground, some large, some small, some long, some round, some green, some black, and some with skin as white as gourds. I smiled and said, "Why not unify these melons?" Yunbo smiled and said, "If they were unified, how could there be a war?" Soon, male and female guests arrived one after another. There were four male guests including myself. There were only two female guests besides Yunbo, none of whom were strangers. Liangcai came out in slippers at half past nine. He pointed at me and said, "If today's event is as you say, old-fashioned and tasteless, I will gladly punish you, the host. If you are wrong, it will be the same." After the meal was over and the sun was setting, the melon war ended. I realized that Liangcai's strategy was new and not a private war. I have compiled new words as follows:</p>
<p>Announcing the Strategy Yunbo and a young girl held various melons and presented them on the large vegetable table. Liangcai turned to a female guest and said, "Sister Shuhua, please be the recorder." He turned to a male guest and said, "Brother Gengyao, please use your good skills to cut the melons." He ordered the young girl to prepare brush, inkstone, and jade paper on the table. He then declared, "The melon wars of the past counted the number of melon seeds and bet on food and wine. My melon war will identify the taste of the melon pulp and bet on cash. Please announce the use of the money." He said, "Be patient."</p>
<p>Wartime Work The host ordered each guest to identify a melon. Shuhua immediately wrote the person's alias on the melon they chose. After the melon was cut, the sweetest one would win without charge. The worst one would pay ten yuan. The rest would pay five, six, four, or three yuan, all based on the sweetness and sourness of the melon. Only the host and his wife would be the observation group to prevent cheating. Then, the male and female guests either tapped the melon skin with their fingers or looked intently at the melon vines, or used their hands to explore the melon navel to distinguish the depth. Shuhua chose a melon for Li Mengzhi, a female guest. Li had secretly selected it first, so they fought over it and the melon fell to the ground. Sweet juice spilled everywhere, causing laughter. This was a scene from the wartime work.</p>
<p>Post-War Announcement The six male and female guests each selected a melon, which were all cut open and tasted. The winners and losers were determined. After Shuhua finished recording, Liangcai said, "Today's battle is not for the sake of getting drunk or full." He then had the young girl bow to all the guests and announce, "This is a poor and helpless child. Her mother was a concubine who died of consumption. Her legal mother sold her to a brothel. Fortunately, I heard about it and redeemed her. I want to use everyone's strength to raise money for her tuition." Everyone said seriously, "Good! This is not a private war!" They paid the money as agreed. Li Mengzhi, the female guest, paid ten yuan as the winner. Zhou Zhongbin also generously donated five yuan. The remaining amount will be the responsibility of Liangcai and his wife.</p>

<p>Ms. Ganduoluo, a British teacher at a public school in London, once reprimanded a student named Harris for being lazy and not answering a question by hitting his palm and punching his shoulder several times. The student, who was only eleven years old, was unable to bear the pain and was seriously injured and unable to attend school. His mother heard about this and sued Ms. Gan in court. Both sides hired lawyers to appear in court to argue the case. The judge ruled that Ms. Gan's actions were unintentional, so the case was not established, but her handling was not without fault. She was ordered to pay litigation costs and medical expenses totaling three pounds, thirteen shillings, and sixpence, and was ordered to publish an apology to the public in the newspaper.</p>
<h3 id="e178">A Record of the Upcoming Visit to Shanghai by American Hero Alvin York Huang Yingdai <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>An American, Sergeant Alvin York, participated in the European War and bravely charged into battle every time. The enemy had to retreat. Americans call him a hero. According to news received by the American community in Shanghai, York will travel to Shanghai in late October of this year. He will be accompanied by seven other war heroes who have received medals. All travel expenses for York's trip to the Far East will be paid by the authorities in his home state of Alabama. This hero from the mountains of the southern United States now has a magnificent house and fertile fields, all donated by enthusiastic people who admired him.</p>
<p>It is not easy to participate in a war and request a commendation from the government. However, York has received a gleaming medal that everyone envies. According to American war records, York was extremely loyal and brave during the Great War. He once held a machine gun in one hand and killed eighteen enemies in a hail of bullets. His courageous spirit is self-evident.</p>
<p>When York was born, his hometown was in a remote mountain valley. He knew how to shoot a gun when he learned to walk. He was born to be a famous general. Later, he was repeatedly surrounded by the enemy on the front lines in France, but he was able to avoid capture because of his superb marksmanship. It is said that after arriving in Shanghai, he plans to stay with his companions for a few days before traveling to other parts of the Far East. The American community in Shanghai will hold a meeting to welcome him as a host after receiving confirmation. York is married and has five children. A few years ago, the deadline for York to redeem farmland he pawned to others was approaching, but he was unable to redeem it. People across the country generously donated money, and York was able to redeem the original field. This shows how deeply Americans admire heroes.</p>
<h3 id="e179">A Trip to Tianma Mountain Chen Boying <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The General History states that Songjiang has the beauty of Nine Peaks and Three Lakes. Among the Nine Peaks, Tianma Mountain is the highest. It is about twenty miles from Songjiang County. Last week, I went to visit it. First, I took a train to Songjiang, then I transferred to a gasoline boat and arrived at the foot of the mountain in about an hour. There is a market town and Lower Peak Temple, which has been destroyed. The mountain is quite flat. Halfway up, there is Central Peak Temple. In front is the mountain gate, and inside is the main hall where Sakyamuni is worshiped, and behind is the meditation room. Leaving the temple and going up to the top of the mountain, the so-called Upper Peak Temple is also reduced to ruins. Looking around, all the peaks are below, as if they are leaning forward, because Songjiang has few mountains and none are as high as Tianma Mountain. Therefore, this mountain has become the master of nowhere. After descending, I returned to Central Peak Temple. The temple plaque says that the pagoda is leaning and about to collapse at any moment, but the monks say that it has been like this for decades and the immortals have pointed it out so it is not a problem. These kinds of Qi Dong folklore are not credible. The construction of the pagoda relies entirely on the center of gravity, and the center of gravity must be calculated in a straight line, which only engineers can understand. Gazing from outside the temple,</p>

<p>The "Nine Organizations" refer to the organizations such as the All-China Athletic Federation, the All-China Aquatic Sports Federation, the Lawn Tennis Association, the Women's Sports Association, and various ball game associations. Therefore, the effectiveness of the Sports Association's work is even greater. Furthermore, leading figures from various relevant parties, such as sports editors from various newspapers, are rehired as committee members and advisors to engage in training, selection, and arrangement matters. It is no accident that Japan achieved total victory in this conference. While in Tokyo, the reporter met several times with Dr. Seiichi Kishida, the president of the All-Japan Athletic Association, the person in charge, Yakushiji Tadashi, and executive staff. Witnessing their dedication to their duties and their enthusiasm for promoting sports, one cannot help but admire their courage and perseverance. This is in stark contrast to our country's All-China Athletic Federation, which is like a scattered collection of sand with no plan whatsoever. A certain gentleman from the Japanese Sports Association once told the reporter that their promotion of sports is not aimed at seeking exceptional excellence for a small number of people, but at striving for the development of the entire sports scene in Japan. He also stated that their promotion of sports, on one hand, uses assumed targets to arouse interest and promote a spirit of competition and enterprise. Therefore, winning the All-Japan Games is the first assumed target, winning the Far Eastern Games is the second assumed target, and winning the World Games is the third assumed target. The ultimate true goal is to strengthen the entire Japanese nation and to improve the race through artificial training. The intentions of the Japanese people are as clear as daylight. In fact, due to the recent development of sports in Japan, the physique of the general public has indeed improved. Young people under the age of thirty are quite tall and resemble the healthy men of our northern regions. The term "dwarf," which was once used to describe them, is no longer very applicable today. This is not the reporter's arbitrary judgment; anyone who has recently been to Japan can attest to this. With accurate statistics, it is believed that the average height of Japanese people has definitely exceeded the height of the Chinese. The improvement is even more evident in women. Japanese women, due to the development of sports, have rosy complexions, firm muscles, and stand tall and graceful, adding to their beauty. Chinese women, on the other hand, are mostly sallow, thin, and weak, especially in Shanghai. In a few decades, one wonders what the physical condition of the Chinese people will be like. The Japanese Ministry of Education gathers experts from time to time to discuss plans for promoting sports, and the various facilities are both thorough and detailed. However, in our country's National Education Conference, there was not a single word mentioning physical education, and the Ministry of Education has not paid any attention to it. The difference between us and Japan is immeasurable. Recently, the Japanese Sports Association expressed dissatisfaction with the adoption of Far Eastern rules during the conference. The All-China Athletic Federation was particularly opposed. It has now been decided that the Ministry of Education will step in to reorganize the association to ensure that the organization of the Sports Association is excellent and beautiful. In terms of economic resources, major capitalists are donating funds to establish a foundation. It is expected that the development of Japanese sports is only in its infancy today.</p>
<p>The green covers the fields as farmers pull weeds and use waterwheels to draw water into the fields. The ancients said, "Every drop of sweat under the crops is hard-earned." Indeed, there are not many trees on the entire mountain, which is also a pity. The monks in the temple offered tea. The temple is still cool and refreshing. After sitting for a long time, poetic thoughts suddenly came, so I scribbled on the wall: Escaping the heat, I surprisingly arrived at Shangfang Mountain. The mountain breeze and Zen combine to bring coolness. In sight, the boundless green is the rice paddies of Jiangnan. The chants of the monks must have echoed on Zhongshan Peak back then, with the mountain foot resonating with the sound of bells. Would the Buddhist monks have understood the intentions of the tourists, diligently rebuilding temples on the upper and lower peaks? I only pity the grass and trees for being too desolate, and my dark eyes truly refuse to see them as green. I want to plant pines and bamboos again, and invite monkeys and cranes to accompany the mountain spirits. Occasionally humming a poem, occasionally stopping to rest, my travels continue, and the ends of the earth await. What is the purpose of life? Why talk about cause and effect, wasting a bowl of tea in a cloud-dwelling room? After finishing the poem, I bid farewell and returned.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Startling News of a Child's Palm Killing an Old Woman Qiu Lang <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>I have often observed that people in the laboring class often engage in verbal abuse and fights. Even if the result is broken skin and bloodshed, there is no danger to life unless a vital part of the body is hit. Now, it is truly a strange tale that a child's palm could actually kill a hired old woman. I will narrate it as follows: A certain gentleman in Hangzhou, already past his prime, still had no children, so he often felt the sorrow of Bo Dao (a historical figure known for his lack of descendants). Madam, a virtuous and wise woman, advised the gentleman to take another concubine to ensure the continuation of the family line. The gentleman agreed and married a certain woman as a concubine. Heaven answered their prayers, and the following year, she gave birth to a son. The gentleman, overjoyed at gaining this precious child, felt that his remaining years would be filled with joy and satisfaction. Time flew by, and the beloved son was already seven years old. Since he was little, the family treated him like a treasure, and the gentleman especially doted on him. As a result, he was excessively spoiled, leading to a wild and arrogant nature. Although still a child, his actions were often absurd. One evening last month, an old hired woman was doing laundry on the steps. The old woman accidentally offended the child with a word, immediately triggering the child's anger. He ran forward and slapped her cheek with his palm. The old woman immediately fell to the ground and did not get up. The family saw this and scolded the old woman for not responding, accusing her of feigning such an ugly state in an attempt to scare the master into giving her a reward with her fake death from the child's slap. However, after a long time, the old woman still did not move slightly. They were greatly astonished and quickly went to help her, but she had already died. Some say that the child's palm struck the old woman's ear door, what is commonly known as "wind entering the cavity," causing such a sudden change. Acknowledgment: Mr. Yan Ermin of Wumen is skilled in poetry and calligraphy, especially in the Zhang Wei Bei styles. Recently, I received a gift of a fan with both exquisite poetry and calligraphy, which is highly treasured. I hereby express my gratitude and introduce him.</p>

<p>Chapter Thirteen: Who plants blessings unintentionally discovers the ring, and for this reason, they intentionally sing the Golden Thread, calling it the lottery, thinking it is a fundraising method to relieve the disaster. In fact, the disaster victims have not received any benefits. People who buy lottery tickets generally fantasize about getting rich, throwing their hard-earned money into a vain pit. There are already many such people. At that time, each province had its own lottery, but in fact, all the drawings were held in Shanghai, because each province could only have one name. Therefore, in addition to the official tickets, there was also a supplementary ticket. The cheaper the ticket was sold, only selling for two or three dimes, the more it could reach the poor people who were deceived. However, the Kindling Happiness Lottery issued by the International Exposition is completely different from ordinary lottery tickets. It does not have the intention of collecting money for profit. All kinds of precious items are donated by charitable ladies and young women. Even the money from the sale of tickets is entirely used for relief. Even if there are some expenses, such as printing tickets and decorations, they are all subsidized by them. Moreover, the lottery is specifically for making a profit, but the Kindling Happiness Lottery makes people feel excited. Also, because the lottery tickets require waiting a month before the drawing, the Kindling Happiness Lottery can be drawn within three days. Therefore, the tickets sold quite a bit. When Long Ziyun and Zuo Shichen went to the place where the Kindling Happiness Lottery exhibits were displayed, unfortunately, they had already packed up the items and would have to come again tomorrow to see them. Since they couldn't see the exhibits, they walked around the perimeter of the exhibition hall and then left the park, each returning home. The International Exposition first opened for three days with good results. By "good results" it means that there were many visitors and their order was not bad. Often, some exhibitions turn out to be boring, or there are disputes and quarrels in the exhibition hall, or there are disturbances from tourists, or there are unfair actions from the staff. However, this exhibition did not have any of those problems. Moreover, because there were many upper-class women supporting it, it gave people a sense of respect in the midst of the games. Therefore, many people suggested that the exhibition could be extended for one more day after the three days. If it were to be extended for several more days, that would not be good. The affairs of Shanghai are always a craze. Everyone joins in the fun for only three or five days. If the date is too long, it will make people bored. Once they are bored, they will lose interest. Therefore, whenever there is an exhibition or something, one must take advantage of the psychology of Shanghai people's craze. Only three or five days is enough to make them stir things up. In other words, it is to make them try it out. Even if everyone says it is bad, as long as everyone tries it out once, taking advantage of the large population of Shanghai, everyone will be fooled once. This three-day situation can be sustained. If everyone agrees that it is good, then naturally it will last more than three days. However, one must leave room for maneuver and not exhaust people's energy and interest. After everyone discussed it, it was decided that the exposition could be extended for one more day. No one agreed to extend it any further.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Gold Prices Plunge Again <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The Downward Trend is Extremely Rampant</p>
<p>Another Drop of 13 Taels and 7 Mace</p>
<p>Great Volatility Within Half a Day. Yesterday, the 26th, the price of gold fluctuated drastically. The downward trend was frequent and unstoppable. The market situation was extremely chaotic, and people's minds were more and more confused. Suddenly, there were four or five taels of hidden risk. The market was unstable. The highest and lowest prices differed by as much as nineteen taels. As for foreign exchange, the listed price continued to increase by one level, but the internal trend was quite weak, and the trading volume of various firms was particularly lively. However, major players tended to sell. Firms such as Yuancheng Yong, Xing'an Chun, Yuanyong Tongchang, and Yuanmaoyong all had intentions to sell. Zhifeng Yong, Dade Cheng, Yu Da, Taikang Run, and Xianjin were buying and selling, while only Wanxing Shunli and small retail investors were buying. Although the asking price in the morning was high, it did not change, so it did not fall. After a while, because everyone was selling, it plummeted by seven or eight taels. Later, the short sellers started to cover, and the exchange rate was also stable, so it rose by six or seven taels. However, there were three or four taels of ups and downs around seventy taels. At noon, there was a sudden sharp reversal, and the trend was fierce. This was due to the weak exchange rates between Japan and the United States. People's psychology was extremely panicked, and the selling pressure was even stronger. It suddenly fell sharply by more than ten taels, breaking through the 560 taels mark. The exchange rate also loosened. Finally, it was between 566 and 567 taels. In the afternoon, because it was the weekend, the market was closed as usual. Yesterday, British silver increased by sixteen and three-eighths, and American silver also increased by three-eighths.</p>
<p>After the opening price, it appeared at 72 taels 1 qian. The initial gold price for September was 570 taels, only down 7 qian. Soon after, buyers were not idle and once reached 72 taels 1 qian. Then, Yuancheng Yong and others sold off, and the exchange rate also showed signs of weakness. The British gold price for October was bought by Huabi for 6 pence 875, and the Italian gold price for August was sold for 6 pence 75. Therefore, it fell by more than 7 taels to 64 taels and a half. It immediately rebounded by 4 taels. When the London exchange rate was announced, it increased by 25, and the US dollar decreased by 1.75. Therefore, it retreated to 67 taels. Retail investors covered, and it instantly increased to 71 taels 45 qian. The internal market was peaceful. Mitsui absorbed August Japanese gold for 1 tael 2 qian 9 fen and then issued 1 tael 3 qian. Soon after, Cheng Qian was exhausted, only fluctuating around 70 taels.</p>
<p>Before the close, it was surprisingly at 53 taels and a half. However, major players continued to sell, and it fell by 4 or 5 taels. At almost 11 o'clock, news came that the exchange rate was illiquid. The market situation suddenly became exhausted, and the downward trend was fierce. It suddenly broke through 60 taels and was only at 55 taels 5 qian. Shunli and others chased in, and it suddenly increased by 4 or 5 taels. Around 11:30, there were more than 4 taels of ups and downs. People's minds were bewildered and aimless, drifting with the wind. At times, because Yongfeng and others sold off frantically, after 11:45, it finally reached 53 taels 5 qian. The exchange rate was even looser. Sumitomo bought October British gold for 7 pence 0625, but it was not easy to sell. When the market closed at noon, it was calculated to be 557 taels, a decrease of more than 13 taels 7 qian compared to the day before. Since this week, the market has been weakening every day.</p>
<p>The final settlement price was down 82-83 taels. The maximum price in half a day was 572 taels 1 qian, and the minimum price was 553 taels and a half, a difference of 18 taels 6 qian. The listed price has been changed to 639 taels, and Japanese gold has decreased by 1.75. From the morning price of 72-73 taels, it decreased to 67-68 taels. At noon, it surprisingly decreased by as much as 82-83 taels. The book price was 56 taels to 57 taels, and the water supplement was 56 taels. The opening price for goods was 69 taels 8 qian, and the closing price was 56 taels.</p>
<p>Major players unanimously dumped their holdings. In terms of trading volume of various firms, Yuancheng Yong, Richang Chunyong, Changsheng Yong, Fuxing Yong, Jin'an Fuchang, Yu Da, Yongfeng Yongkang, etc. all sold. Taikang Run, Zhifeng Yong, Dade Cheng, and Hengxing were indecisive. Wanxing Xinxing, Yuankang Xiang, and Shunli all bought. There were also firms that were in and out frequently, in a chaotic manner. Dalianbang bought more than it sold, buying a total of 1,500 shares and selling 400-500 shares. Guangbang bought and sold about the same amount.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Foreign Exchange Weakens, Trading Volume is Low <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Listed Price Continues to Increase by One Level</p>
<p>Yesterday, being the weekend, the foreign exchange market was open for half a day in the morning as usual. The HSBC listed price continued to increase by one level. British gold increased by 25 to 1 shilling 6 pence 375. US dollars increased by half a yuan to 37 yuan 25. Indian exchange increased by 1.5 yuan to 103 rupees 25. German exchange increased by 2 yuan to 156 marks. Yang increased by 1.25 yuan to 92 shields and a half. French francs increased by 13 yuan to 947 yuan. Pi exchange decreased by 2 taels to 151 taels 25. Hong Kong slightly decreased by 75 to 84 taels and a half. Japanese gold decreased by 1.75 to 1 tael 3 qian 2 fen 5. The asking price had been increased again. The London exchange market also increased by 3125. As for the internal market, the morning market was still flat. Later, it suddenly turned weak. The standard gold price was stable to weakening, and the downward trend could not be suppressed. The sudden drop into the 560 taels level was due to the panic of major players competing to sell. At the close of the market at noon, compared to the day before, British gold increased by 3125, US dollars increased by 625, and Japanese gold decreased by 2.75. Chinese merchants and speculators were not thriving. This was because the gold market fluctuated too much and the volatility was too great. They did not dare to take action. The transaction volume of British gold was more than 100,000 pounds. Gold firms sold 100,000 pounds, which were absorbed by Sumitomo, Huabi, Shanghai, etc. Banks also traded tens of thousands. Only 100,000 US dollars were sold to Mitsubishi, etc. 1 million in Japanese exchange was also sold. Japanese banks had a slight appetite. Sumitomo, Zhengjin, Mitsui, and Huabi absorbed the exchange. Mitsui also sold a little. The market sentiment had already weakened.</p>

<p>According to London telegrams yesterday, the asking price of silver rose again. The near-term price increased by 1875 to 16 pence 1875 (equivalent to 1 shilling 7 pence 125 for British gold). The long-term price also increased by 1875 to 16 pence 0625. The asking price rose because a small number of short sellers were covering their positions, and the market was calm with little supply. According to the New York telegram, the price of American silver increased by 375 to 3.5. The British exchange rate against the US dollar rose by 09375 to 4 yuan 8 jiao 6 fen 71875. The US dollar against the British pound increased by 03125 to 4 yuan 8 jiao 6 fen 6875. The Japanese dollar against the US dollar was still at 49 yuan 3125.

<h3 id="e186">Fluctuations in Silver Cents Are Difficult to Predict <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>General Market Situation. The market price of silver cents was generally stable, with slight fluctuations. It was either the same price or 125, and up to 25. Any increase or decrease of 0.5 or 0.375 was considered a change in the market. Currently, the fluctuations are always around 1 cent, which is considered normal, making it difficult for both buyers and sellers to predict whether the market will rise or fall. It is difficult for outsiders to know, and even insiders find it difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>Cents Discount Prices (Silver Cents). The morning market price of cents was slightly lower at 7 qian 2 fen 9 li and a half, down 0.375, because the previous afternoon's price was too high. The afternoon market suddenly continued to fall by 0.875 to 7 qian 2 fen 8 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half. As a result, it was a total of 1.125 lower than the previous day's afternoon market. (Silver Discount) The situation was getting worse. The morning market only opened at 3 fen, and the afternoon market only opened at 2 fen, which seemed to be 1 fen lower than the day before. There was no additional water in the head. There were no problems with the bank's listed price.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Situation. Due to the scarcity of the Jiangnan small silver coins and the lack of competition, the results of both the morning and afternoon markets were 6 qian 3 fen 2 li, slightly better by 0.5 li compared to the day before. The transaction volume was 1,500 jiao in the morning market and none in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small silver coins depreciated again. The morning market was 6 qian 1 fen 2 li 8 hao 7 hu and a half, a sudden decrease of 1.625 compared to the previous afternoon. Because there were few transactions in the afternoon market, the market price did not change. The transaction volume was 145,000 jiao in the morning market and 25,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins suddenly increased by 4,000 wen to 392,000 wen. In the past few days, the price has surprisingly increased by more than 10,000.</p>
<p>Inflow and Outflow of Silver Dollars (Silver). Yesterday was Saturday, and the banks' deposit withdrawals were usually slow. Chinese merchants deposited and withdrew more than 1.7 million in bills. Foreign merchants deposited and withdrew more than 900,000 in bills. Various goods, exchange taxes, and other items amounted to more than 6 million. Special items and settlements amounted to more than 2 million. Outflows from warehouses amounted to 1.4 million. Japanese banks deposited and withdrew more than 3.7 million in various items and deposited 500,000 in warehouses. Qianzhuang Yin Gong deposited and withdrew more than 25 million in bills. Head office items deposited and withdrew more than 310,000. Various remittance items amounted to more than 600,000. Cash deposits amounted to tens of thousands. (Foreign Dollars) In the morning market, 1.855 million was made in remittances and bills. In the afternoon market, 1.08 million was made. There were no transactions in banknotes in the morning market and 50,000 in the afternoon market. In the outside market, the number of banknotes traded was 144,000 in the morning market and 110,000 in the afternoon market. In the morning market, the interbank transactions were 400,000. In the afternoon market, the interbank transactions were 350,000. More than 1.2 million were deposited and withdrawn in foreign currency accounts of various banks, and more than 100,000 banknotes were in and out. Qianzhuang Yang Gong deposited and withdrew more than 3.3 million. More than 1.8 million in foreign head office items were deposited and withdrawn. 1.1 million was lent in foreign currency. The transaction volume of small Qianzhuang was 600,000-700,000. The source of customer funds was more than 400,000, and only more than 300,000 was withdrawn. 500,000 was concentrated in this area, which is why the cent discount price fell back in the afternoon market.</p>

<p>Starting Today, July Futures Trading Suspended in Preparation for Delivery</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public debt market was uneventful because the July period was the last day of trading. The market was flat as before, with no major inflows or outflows. Although many types of spot goods were offered, the transaction volume was still low. The July period of the various bonds for demobilization, customs duties, troop reduction, and consolidation of administration were raised by one yuan or several jiao as short positions were covered due to the expiration of delivery. The August period also rebounded, but each rose about six or seven jiao compared to the previous day. The other periods were very sluggish and fluctuated without much change. Although they were generally slightly higher than the previous day, the number was very small. Furthermore, there had been no transactions in disaster relief spot goods for a long time. Yesterday's price was more than five yuan lower than in late May. The total daily spot goods transaction volume was only 14,000 yuan, and the futures transaction volume was 6.9 million yuan.</p>

<p>The Yarn Market Turned Back Up, and the Downward Trend in Overseas Cotton Yarn Market Stabilized, Slightly Boosting Confidence. Current Yarn Sales Are Smooth. Yunnan Merchants are Actively Purchasing, and They are All Coarse Yarn. Xuzhou Merchants are Absorbing Futures Yarn Transactions More and More. Therefore, Buyers are Tightening Up and Deciding Not to Let Go. Retail Investors Are Also Keen to Go Long. However, Ruida and a Certain Japanese Merchant Continue to Dump Their Positions, and the Amount is Huge. The Market Has Not Been Affected in Any Way. Bidding Buyers Are Stubborn. The Opening Price of Bidding Was Level With American Cotton. People Were Stable. Sellers Raised Their Prices, But Buyers Were Still Actively Purchasing Because Current Sales Were Good. Each Rose by Four, Five, Six, or Seven Qian. The Afternoon Was Flat. The Near Month Was Unchanged, While the Far Month Fell by One, Three, or Four Qian. The Total Daily Transaction Volume Was 10,200 Bales. The Buyer With The Most Bales Purchased Was Yichang, With 900 Bales.

<p>The Cotton Market Is Slightly Flat. Because the Downward Trend of American Cotton Has Subsided, the Bullish Pulling Force Is Still Strong. The Absorption in August Is Very Strong, So the Market Situation Is Tight. Most People Think That American Cotton Will Fall Sharply and Rebound Slightly. The Weather Is Good, So There Is a Deep Sense of Overthrowing. However, After the Internal Organization of Buyers Is Consolidated, Changes Are Difficult to Predict. Han Merchants Are Purchasing New Cotton and Selling Old Cotton. Indian Cotton Is Cheaper Because the Exchange Rate Is Tight.</p>
<p>Near-Month Han Bidding Bulls Increase Their Positions. The Opening Price of Han Bidding Was Calm Because American Cotton Was Quiet. The Bulls in August Increased Their Purchases and Increased Their Positions. The Rising Trend Was More Intense. The Near-Month Rose by 4 Qian to 4 and a Half Qian. The Far-Month Rose by 1 Qian. The Afternoon Was Flat. The Near-Month Fell by 3 Qian, and the Far-Month Fell by 5 Fen. The Total Daily Transaction Volume Was 73,100 Dan.

English cotton futures fell 6 to 7 points, spot prices fell 11 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 5 points.

<p>Taizhou Cooperative Has Received Early Cotton</p>
<p>Cotton Crop Progressing Smoothly, Actual Demand Remains Stagnant</p>
<p>New York telegram on the 25th reports on the cotton market situation for the week: The central cotton belt continues to be dry, and several areas in the west are also dry. However, when the October futures price for new cotton was above 10.5 cents, the buying momentum did not significantly increase. After reports of rainfall, prices fell back. Rain in the east has averted drought, but the drought and heat in parts of Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama have not caused many reports of new cotton damage, which has dampened the bullish sentiment. Furthermore, cotton production news that was beneficial to the bulls has been half offset by statistics favorable to the shorts and unsatisfactory commercial conditions. Executive committee members of the cooperative stated that loans collateralized by new cotton will depend on current market prices. Also, Director William of the Bureau of Agriculture stated that loans will be set at no less than 65 percent of the cotton market price. The Texas Cooperative has now received early cotton. When submitting cotton that has not been graded, loans are generally 9 US cents per pound.</p>
<p>Also, news reports that rain has fallen in many areas and is expected to continue. It is anticipated that hedging will increase soon. The new cotton crop is progressing well, but some areas in the southwest still need rain. Demand for current cotton is sluggish, and domestic piece goods trade is poor.

<p>Rice market along the rivers continues to decline sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday at Zhabei, over ten boats arrived via the roads and rivers. The market is still stagnant. The price of Northern polished rice fell another three to four cents. Sub-grade rice saw a drop of eight to nine cents. Only the top-grade rice was offered at 20 yuan and five or six cents, but even sub-grade rice, although offered at 16 yuan, found few buyers. Currently, the rice market is still difficult to stabilize, and it is feared that it will continue to decline. The output of Eastern New polished rice is gradually increasing, but sales are not very smooth, and prices have fallen another half yuan. The opening price was a high of 19.5 yuan, a significant drop of one and a half yuan in three days. There is a scarcity of thin paddy, and the market is stable. There is no Yangjian rice available, but factories still have some, and prices have plummeted, with practically no one inquiring. The spot price for altered silver yuan coins has decreased gradually, and the overall market has dropped another two cents. Currently, the prices of all goods are plummeting, and the trend is still sharply downward.</p>
<p>The supply from rivers south of Shanghai is still scarce, and sales in this district are also flat. The price of northern polished rice has fallen by two cents, a more moderate decline than in Zhabei. Eastern New polished rice has also fallen by half a yuan. Southern thin paddy rice is slightly stagnant, and the poor market conditions are showing signs of decline. The market for white silver yuan coins is not active, and arrivals are also sluggish. The overall market is softening, while Yangmi rice is feeling slightly firm in contrast, but the momentum is unlikely to last for long. This is because rice from Jiangxi has been officially opened, and large quantities will arrive in Shanghai next month. Rice from Hunan will also follow the same procedure as rice from Jiangxi. In addition, exchange rates are easing, and the price of foreign rice is becoming cheaper. Moreover, other new polished rice will also be launched one after another. Given these circumstances, how can rice prices not fall?</p>
<h3 id="e192">Coarse-Milled Rice Surges by One Yuan <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Limited Stocks, Inland Areas Compete to Purchase</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was initially flat in the morning, but because the Pinghu area competed to purchase coarse-milled rice, and stocks were low with a lack of high-quality goods, once the inland areas competed to purchase, prices jumped by a significant one yuan. Small coarse-milled rice was also purchased by the inland areas, with both rising three to five cents. Saigon rice sales were weak. Only Saigon large coarse-milled rice was sold in three thousand bag lots, with prices ranging from 10.065 yuan to 11.56 yuan. Small coarse-milled rice was sold in fifteen hundred bag lots, with prices ranging from 13.65 yuan to 13.9 yuan. Mindan rice was sold in two thousand bag lots, with prices ranging from 13.85 yuan to 14.4 yuan. Number One Saigon was sold in one hundred bag lots at 15.85 yuan. Number Two Saigon was sold in three hundred bag lots with prices varying between 12.9 and 13.7 yuan. Small coarse-milled rice was sold in two thousand bag lots at prices ranging from 10.055 yuan to 11 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Recent Wheat Rebounds One Cent <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market initially showed signs of stabilizing, followed by a bullish trend. At the beginning of the month, the market was stable as both longs and shorts settled their positions. Subsequently, as the shorts wanted to push prices further down and the longs refused to give way, prices were pushed higher and higher. The closing price reached 4 taels and 7.5 cents, a significant rebound of one cent from the previous day. Because the current month is coming to an end, the shorts have no choice but to cover their positions. The other months were also boosted as the sharp rise in the near-term price instilled confidence. As a result, August and September each improved by three cents, October by two cents, and November and December were unchanged. Spot wheat, based on the standard of the current month, also suddenly rose by one cent. Millers were more active in their purchasing, so high-quality goods in each grade also improved by two to three cents. Medium and sub-grade wheat remained flat. It is estimated that over four thousand bags of wheat, including Huangqiao, Yizheng, Huzhou, Yaowan, Shashi, and Hankou wheat, were purchased by Shen Da, Fuxin, and other mills.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Flour Market Rises and Then Levels Out <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of flour for the current month reached a high of 2 taels and 5.2 cents in several morning sessions, an increase of 1.0 cent compared to the previous day's closing price. However, when trading opened in the afternoon, the shorts were unwilling to cover their positions and showed a tendency to liquidate their warehouse receipts, causing confidence to weaken slightly. August and September were slightly bullish due to the significant inverted spread, with concerns that major mills would not ease their positions in the current month and might have a similar tendency in the following month. Therefore, the shorts were particularly eager to cover their positions. As a result, the current month fell slightly by 0.25 cents compared to the previous day, August and September improved by 0.5 cents, October improved by 0.25 cents, November fell slightly by 0.5 cents, and December fell slightly by 0.25 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Silk and Tea, Leaf Buds and Chunmee, European Sales Improve <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at the tea market of foreign firms in this port, firms dealing in high-grade Wu Yuan leaf buds and Chunmee tea, such as Ying Zhuang, Jinlong, Baochang, and Tongfu, showed strong interest. Mid-to-high-grade goods also saw some scattered transactions. The top-grade of Chunmee reached 232 taels, a recent high. Gongxi green tea, assisted by the association, continued to seek out goods. Bai Tou Zhuang Qianyi and Fulin firms also showed interest in tea with excellent leaf quality. The market situation was slightly lively.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Grey Goods, Moonflower Flannel, Sales Brisk and Continuing to Rise <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Although the prices of cotton yarn in the cotton yarn market have been declining in recent days, cotton cloth has not been significantly affected. This is because inventories are low and customer sales are not sluggish. Therefore, fine cloth and fine twill have risen instead of falling. Ningbo firms resumed their purchases of 16-pound coarse cloth yesterday, resulting in the completion of over 150 transactions, causing prices to become firm again. The route for the military’s 11-pound cloth is quite active, so it is also holding firm. Cantonese and Shantou firms resumed transactions in fine twill, completing 500 deals for August deliveries, so it will not be easy to loosen in the immediate future. The route for dyeing fine cloth is still smooth, and Northern firms are periodically making purchases. The excellent market conditions are rare in recent years.</p>
<p>Recent increases and decreases have been mixed for both Eastern and Western grey goods. Foreign blue serge, gray serge, cotton velvet, and fei cotton velvet from Eastern goods have softened slightly. This is because of the congestion caused by the arrival of goods. However, Moonflower has continued to rise, and the inventory of goods in the market is almost exhausted. This is because, although the Eastern exchange rate has fallen in recent days, the base price is still required to be 1.85 cents for small rolls, 1.925 cents for large rolls, and 1.825 cents for black patterns. Therefore, the spot goods still feel cheap, resulting in Tianjin, Sichuan, Ningbo, Hankou, and other firms being active in handling the goods. Those holding the goods are unwilling to sell, resulting in continued price increases. Western goods are still in a slump. Shanghai silk, the Yangtze firms are purchasing a lot of it. The price for Mei Xing Gao Zhao is 12 taels and 8.5 cents. Fair Copper Bird Terrace is 11 taels and 7.5 cents.</p>

<p>Shanghai Market</p>
<h3 id="e197">Market News <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>At the intersection of Gongguan Road and Zilaihuo Street, east and west of Gaodi Lane, in accordance with the new regulations of the French Municipal Council, the latest type of three-story residential building with magnificent and sturdy three- and four-story shops will soon be completed at a low price. The sidewalks are paved with concrete, making them smooth and preventing customers from being hindered by rainy weather. Therefore, there is a great demand for rentals at this time, with more monks than porridge, it is said.</p>
<p>The Guanshengyuan Food Company on Nanjing Road declares that the Guanzhen Photography Department attached to the main store has been expanding since this spring, and the business has been progressing rapidly. The excellent quality of the products has a considerable reputation in Shanghai, and the prices are also very fair. For example, all kinds of artistic photographs are given a 30% discount to customers. Small photos are four cents per dozen, and passport-style photos are eight cents for four, which is especially popular with all sectors of society. Although the weather has been very hot in recent days, the business has not decreased as a result. From 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM and from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM in the afternoons, the weather is relatively cool, and many customers come to take pictures, it is said.</p>
<p>The American-owned China Business Company at 70 Sichuan Road declares that the company has been engaged in real estate business for many years, relying on its vast experience to become a leader in the industry, and has deeply won the trust of all sectors of society. As a result, the business is growing day by day. In order to meet the needs of the upper-class Chinese and for the purpose of investing in real estate, eight model Chinese residences have been built at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Matterhurst Road. The style is novel, the materials are sturdy, and the facilities are comprehensive. The arrangement is beautiful and unprecedented. All sanitary facilities, such as hot and cold water pipes and bathrooms, are complete. The building has three floors, with clean and spacious halls, bedrooms, servants' rooms, and storage rooms, all arranged in an orderly manner. There is a lawn in front and a sundeck on top. The air is fresh and elegant, and it is suitable for hygiene. As for the convenience of transportation and the safety of protection, it can be imagined that the location is moderate. Moreover, each building has its own deed, making purchase particularly convenient. It is truly an ideal residence and the most suitable for Chinese needs and investors. The drawings of the new house can be reviewed in the July 20th Shen Bao Pictorial Weekly, in every tenth issue. If you are interested in coming to negotiate, you are most welcome, it is said.</p>
<p>The Chinese-Western Pharmacy declares that the weather has been extremely hot and the sun is scorching in recent days. If we want to ensure the safety of our lives, we must seek hygienic methods. Not only should we pay attention to food, drink, and daily life, but we must also eliminate mosquitoes, flies, and other harmful insects as soon as possible, so as to avoid the many diseases of autumn. Moreover, diseases such as malaria and dysentery are actually transmitted by mosquitoes and flies, so insects like mosquitoes and flies cannot be allowed to remain. We should try to eliminate them as soon as possible. This has been recognized by the world for a long time. This pharmacy has invented an insecticide called "Fly Don't Move." No matter if the insects fly, crawl, walk, or jump, once they touch this medicine, they will die immediately and cannot escape. The effect is very effective, and the method of use is also very simple. Just put this medicine into a specially made sprayer and spray it from time to time in the halls, bedrooms, kitchens, stoves, and gardens.</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>If you spray it on the walls and other places from time to time, then the mosquitoes and flies will disappear and the flying insects will not invade, which is very beneficial to hygiene. Therefore, the number of people buying this Fly Don't Move insecticide from this pharmacy has been increasing day by day, and the number of households in other cities that distribute and sell it is also a hundred times more than in the past, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Theater News <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The Star Film Company announced that the long-rumored film starring the returning movie star Xuan Jinglin as a romantic woman has mostly been completed. A dance scene was recently filmed at the company's studio. This scene holds an important position in the play. The dance hall set was built by the company to resemble the most luxurious modern dance hall, adorned with dazzling lights, making the entire scene extremely rich and beautiful. The director recruited the most beautiful dancers from dance halls across Shanghai to join the performance. Xuan Jinglin, playing the romantic woman, moves gracefully in the scene, vividly portraying the personality of the character, which is said to be absolutely stunning.</p>
<p>The Hai Xing Film Company announced that their upcoming film, "Tears of the Cold Palace," is the debut work of Li Boming. The plot is full of twists and turns, and the details are beyond what can be known. In addition, director Dong Tianwei has been in the film industry for a long time and has gained considerable practical experience. His brother, Tianduo's, new photography techniques are sure to be welcomed by everyone. They also earnestly requested that the famous strongman Cha Ruilong, renowned throughout Shanghai, play the lead role in the film.</p>
<p>○ Medical News</p>
<p>The Hualong Chinese Medicine Hospital announced that in response to social needs, the renowned Shanghai doctor Ding Jiwan established the hospital, located opposite the Xiude Li on Changbang Road in the French Concession, at the intersection of Huage Dai Road. Since its establishment just three months ago, the threshold has been worn through by those seeking treatment. Many patients with severe illnesses have been cured immediately. However, the original wards were insufficient to accommodate all patients, often leaving those who came later disappointed. The hospital now specially adds several wards to meet the enthusiastic demand for treatment and to expand the hospital's benevolent practice of providing relief. The director, Tong Shaobo, inherited his family's medical knowledge and has particularly strong expertise in eye diseases. He performs surgeries without any pain, which is truly a blessing for patients.</p>
<p>The Jiufu Company on Baike Road announced that the company's pharmaceutical business is expanding daily. Recently, it has been making every effort to produce raw materials for medicines to recover rights and interests. Last year, it prepared to manufacture a tonic and cough medicine similar to a popular imported product called "Bu Li Duo," which has been advertised in newspapers. Now, after more than a year of planning and preparation, it will soon be launched. Its contents are extracted from turtle liver oil, with a alcohol-soluble concentrated ingredient called Jiufu Zhaju'er, combined with germinated wheat paste compound, subphosphite candy, wild cherry candy, and other ingredients to create the latest delicious tonic cough medicine. It is divided into pure and compound varieties, identical to a certain popular imported product. All manufacturing uses new-style machinery and equipment, and the product is reliable. Once tried, whether for tonic or treatment, satisfactory results can be obtained. At a time when gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and the price of imported goods is skyrocketing, switching to Bu Li Duo is more cost-effective and achieves the same effect, so its social acceptance is foreseeable. ○ Calligraphy and Painting News</p>
<p>The Yicheng Calligraphy and Painting Society announced that the society is jointly organized by national seal carving, calligraphy, and painting artists. It initially rented its location on Laohe Road. The number of members joining was very enthusiastic, and the place was too small to display everything. At the end of last year, it once closed down for reorganization. Since Li ○yun, a landscape expert, returned to Shanghai from Guangdong, he entrusted Qian Huafo to take charge of the matter and continue the process. It has now rented several rooms in the Huili Company building at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road as its location. It is quite spacious and suitable, and everything is being arranged. The exhibition of works by famous people is very rich. Among them are Wang Yiting, Luo Liangong, Zeng Nongran, Yu Tiansui, Qian Huafo, Huang Taixuan, Zhang Yuguang, Yao Mocun, Yu Yuan and others. The collection of calligraphy and paintings is appropriate and impressive. It is also heard that the society has hired lawyer Yuan Xilian as its legal advisor and will soon hold a grand inaugural meeting to seek large-scale development.</p>
