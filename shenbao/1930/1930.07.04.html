<p>刺普脫（A·S　·Rappoport）著　　陳訓炤譯商務出版　　哲學是一種研究各種現象的原理及其全體底關係的學問我以爲無論研究什麽學問的或者是在社會上辦什麽事情的人都應該研究哲學懂得哲學因爲我總覺得研究各種專門學問的人和在社會上辦事的人他們因爲不懂哲學所以在研究學問方面只知在自已專門的學問裹面打圈子在社會上辦事呢只知頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚看不出各種現象的根本原因找不到整個的辦法這不是瞎說的只要各位留心觀察一下人家和自已就曉得了記者本來是研究政治科學的但是研究的起頭也從哲學下手這就是一種經騐之談吧　　但是在各種學問當是恐怕没有像哲學這様容易給一般人誤會的了一般人總以爲哲學是一種虚無縹涉的東西研究哲學是一種閒人閒事不錯哲學的書本的確很難找得一本適當的在過去國內出版的哲學書中丨尤其是入門的書都是把哲學講得太玄虚了差不多令看書的人摸不着頭腦往往看見有許多熱心學問的青年男女他們看哲學書到了一半就掩卷而逃了而在大學校第一年級講授哲學課程的先生們呢又大都東抄西襲串起來講只拿一大批名詞的法寳大顯神通弄得學生們頭暈腦脹大學也根本不注重這門學問（和歐洲的大學剛相反）所以到大學畢業也莫名其妙前面所講過的不懂哲學的毛病就免不了以上的說話不過是說明哲學的重要引起注意而已至於怎様可以了解哲學和引起研究的興趣呢記者因此想介紹各位一本書或者於各位有點帮助　　這本哲學初桄是商務書館最近出版的牠的著者和譯者記者都全不認識只因爲曾經細細讀過一遍認識牠本身的價値所以敢介紹給各位現在請先把這本書的內容介紹出來然後介紹牠的優點　　這本書一共分開三篇第一篇是哲學的意義及其內容第二篇是哲學的沿革及其趨勢第三篇是哲學的派别及重要問題在這三篇裹頭可算把哲學的全部分給我們說明了　　在第一篇裹面是概論的性質把哲學這個悶葫蘆給我們打破了這裹面分開八章第一章是緒論說明哲學的主義就是「解釋萬物的本質來源及其相互的關係」這様的定義是再賅括没有了牠還說明哲學爲研究便利起見分成三大類（一）單數的問題（純理哲學）（二）複數的問題（自然哲學）（三）生物之個别的問題（人生哲學）最後再把哲學的內容介紹</p>
<p>學（四）論理學（五）審美學（六）倫理學（七）法律哲學（八）社會學及歷史哲學以後各章就把上面所舉的內容逐一加以槪括的說明　　第二篇是一種歷史的叙述使我們知道西洋哲學的淵源及其趨勢裹面分開五章第一章緖論說明哲學史的分期</p>
<p>近世期以後四章就把這四個時期概說出來提示牠的重要點并加以精到的批評在第四章近世期裹面提出歐洲各國民族性的特點爲造成近世各派哲學思想的原因很有批評的眼光　　第三篇說明哲學的派别及其問題裹面分開五章第一章說哲學要解决的不外三端（一）內容（二）方法（三）原因爲研究便利起見把哲學的問題歸納成三大類（一）純理哲學問題（二）道德哲學問題（三）智識哲學問題第二章討論純理哲學問題把近代純理哲學者所謂宇宙存在的基本之三派丨唯心論唯物論心物二元論的理诠都介紹出來并把牠的來源整理清楚第三章討論道德哲學的問題提出歷代哲學家所費心思以求解决的道德問題（一）道德觀念之起源（二）服從道德觀以節</p>
<p>統的說明第四章討論智識哲學把智識哲學之內容與功用分成三項說明就是</p>
<p>識從何而來或其元始問題（三）智識可求乎或其效力及範圍問題最末一章結論提出哲學要解决的兩個問題第一就是哲學要努力解决的丨存在者何物物如何可以存在我們所知的是什麽我們的本分是什麽我們何以如此不如彼第二就是哲學和日常存在的事物都有密切關係哲學不能和實際分離所以哲學的問題是日進無已的　　我們看這本書的內容可以知到牠的優點就足能夠把哲學全部的學問加以系統的說明於一本小册子裹面可以給我們以哲學概論哲學思想史哲學的重要問題的一種很清楚的概念而牠的說明方法也很清楚並能加以較客觀的批評使初入門的人不致弄不清楚哲學的體系和有先入爲主的危險至於譯筆之暢逹和譯名的通俗也是記者自已閱讀時所感覺到的　　末了記者還有句說話我介紹這本初入門的和篇幅很小的哲學書也許有人說我太無聊了其實我何嘗不知道介紹高深的和篇幅宏偉的書呢不過初入門的弄不清楚還有什麽高深之可言不從篇幅較小的下手何有於宏篇巨著我以爲社會上一般人很需要一種起馬的哲學的修養給他們一點求學作事的指導只要您費些須時光便可以把牠看完於生活繁忙溽暑困人的時候也很合算吧</p>

<h3 id="e4">The Revival of the Customs Union Proposal <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Although the proposal for a customs union has been advocated for a long time, the recent impetus for European countries to unanimously agree to its establishment is the new US tariff. The convocation of the previous tariff truce conference was universally known to be designed to deal with the United States. However, due to the different economic structures, agricultural, industrial, and commercial conditions of various countries, it did not produce any significant effect. Now, with the publication of the new US tariff, all countries have been affected, feeling more pain and realizing the urgency of uniting against the US. This is why the conference on the economic organization of Europe passed a unanimous resolution to establish the union. Some say that this customs union is the initial step in implementing the United States of Europe plan, which is also Briand's predetermined policy. This seems plausible. However, Briand's memorandum on the United States explicitly states that politics should come before economics. Even if the European economy is to be reorganized and tariffs are taken into account, it should be done after the political organization has made some progress. Why is it that other issues have not been discussed, but this customs union proposal has been suddenly passed? This shows that the customs union has become the most needed thing in Europe at present, and the reason why Europe needs it is because it has a formidable enemy in the United States. In all matters, if one wants to deal with external forces, one must first unite internally. Under the tide of this economic panic, European countries, even if they are not trying to deal with external forces, should understand each other and seek self-reliance, eliminate all obstacles between countries, and establish a foundation for economic cooperation. This is indeed a crucial plan. However, is cooperation easy to achieve? The situations of various countries are different, and their interests are inconsistent. How can one force difference to be the same? Among the major countries in the world today, there are two things they are determined to achieve, though they have repeatedly failed but still do not forget: one is the Economic Union Conference, and the other is the Disarmament Conference. However, if the effects of these two things in the past are so clear, can one expect a different outcome in the future? Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>

<h3 id="e6">Political Disputes in the North <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Seventeen Representatives Urge Yan to Form a Government. Beijing: A certain member of the Western Hills faction advised Zou and Xie not to insist on the Shanghai Second Congress, saying that after the enlarged meeting produces a government, military, political, and party power will definitely not be allowed to be manipulated by the left wing. For now, appease them a little and finish the scene perfectly. In the future, there will be reasons to deal with them. Do not take them too seriously. Moreover, the representatives of each army are united with us. Our support is not weak. Our goal is to have the baby delivered safely. The midwife's meals and sedan chair expenses can be generous. The midwife's authority and temper can also be accepted. Fortunately, they will have nothing to do after the birth, so there is no need to worry too much. Zou and Xie intend to act, saying that if it can be guaranteed that the Second Guangdong Congress's telegram will not mention party unification, they are willing to cooperate with him. As a result, Zhao Pilian visited Chen Gongbo again, and the mediator proposed that the telegram to Wang Jingwei has not yet been replied to (Third day special dispatch). Beijing: Pan Yizhi, Chen Jiyan, and other seventeen representatives telegraphed Yan on the first day, urging him to form a government, saying that military and political affairs have become increasingly complex in the past month, and diplomatic responses and financial planning cannot be managed without a government. The organization of the government cannot be delayed. Please take charge resolutely and do not hesitate any longer. Yan telegraphed Zhao of Beijing, saying that the formation of a government must go through a party process and should not prioritize politics over party affairs. Currently, the Jin faction's compromise plan for party affairs is that the Guangdong committee will convene an enlarged meeting via telegram, but Wang Jingwei and Zou Xie have not yet explicitly expressed acceptance (Second day special dispatch). Beijing: A certain important person said that Yan and Feng are eagerly hoping that the government will be established soon (Second day special dispatch). Beijing: A certain important person suggested that the public funds for the enlarged meeting should be generous so that the group can be easily strengthened and the government can be produced smoothly (Second day special dispatch). Beijing: Today, Qin Zhen telegraphed Yan to report on the situation of mediating party affairs. Zhao Pilian and Ji Gongquan also sent telegrams to Yan reporting on the progress of the negotiations (Third day special dispatch). Beijing: Today, a certain left-wing gentleman said that Wang's views have been detailed in the Eastern telegram. It does not matter whether Wang comes or not. As long as party comrades recognize that they are moving towards the path of democratic centralization, Wang himself has no power or position and does not need it (Third day special dispatch). Beijing: Today, a certain military representative telegraphed and urged Wang to come north to preside over the enlarged meeting and produce a government. If Wang acts otherwise after the birth, no one will stop him. Otherwise, he must take responsibility for the impact of military and political affairs on the party. However, he also telegraphed Yan and Zhao Daiwen, advocating caution in forming a government (Third day special dispatch). Beijing: Chen Gongbo said a moment ago that the banquet last night did not discuss any specific plans. The rumor that he drafted eight measures for organizing the government is false. He seeks instructions from Wang in all matters. He also said that the long speeches by Wang Faqin in Zhengzhou reported in the newspapers in recent days are untrue. Wang has never given such speeches. A party member named Wang Lizai came to the Zhengzhou press, mistaking Lizai for Lizhai. This is also a ridiculous matter (Third day special dispatch).

<p>Russian Foreign Ministry Sends Personnel to Apologize. Nanjing: Liu Zerong, a specialist committee member for the Sino-Soviet Conference, was suddenly taken to the police station by Russian police in front of a Moscow hotel on June 30. At the time, Committee Member Liu explained his position and showed his diplomatic passport, but the police ignored him. When he requested to notify the delegation by telephone, he was also refused, claiming that he was acting on orders from the State Political Bureau. After arriving at the police station, the Russian director examined his passport and said that the police officer had made a mistake and released Liu. Upon hearing the news, the Moscow representative immediately protested that Committee Member Liu had not violated any laws and held a diplomatic passport, so being insulted for no reason violated international norms. The Soviet Foreign Ministry then sent the Deputy Director of the Protocol Department to formally express regret, stating that this serious error occurred due to mistaken identity and that the police officer had been detained and punished. The police chief had also been severely punished. They would ensure that such incidents would not happen again and apologized to Committee Member Liu personally on behalf of the ministry (Third day special dispatch).</p>

<p>The Authorities Plan to Formulate Inspection Measures. Implementation to Begin on the Tenth of This Month. Nanjing: The Central Propaganda Department believes that if Chinese and foreign reporters use long-distance telephones between Nanjing and Shanghai to send telegrams without inspection, inaccurate news will be published in newspapers from time to time, affecting public opinion. During this period of suppressing the rebellion, negligence should not be tolerated. It has specially consulted with the Central Secretariat, the Ministry of Communications, and the Capital Post and Telecommunications Inspection Office to jointly draft inspection measures, which have been submitted to the Central Government for amendment and approval. Implementation will begin on the tenth of this month. The Central Secretariat, the General Headquarters, the Ministry of Communications, the Capital Post and Telecommunications Inspection Office, and the Central Propaganda Department will jointly send personnel to handle the matter, still under the jurisdiction of the Post and Telecommunications Inspection Office. The detailed measures have been discussed and agreed upon by the relevant personnel. On the third day, the Central Propaganda Department sent a letter to the Beijing offices of various newspapers informing them of the telegram inspection measures. The measures are as follows: (1) During wartime, news reporters, both Chinese and foreign, must be subject to inspection, and inspection measures will be formulated. (2) Chinese and foreign news reporters must send telegrams directly at the telegraph office. (3) All reporters must submit their telegraph codes to the inspectors for inspection before sending telegrams. Those that are deemed to be sendable after inspection should be stamped and then sent. (4) Within the scope that does not hinder the business of the telegraph office and the convenience of news communication, the inspection office should discuss with the telegraph office for handling. (5) When necessary, foreign reporters must send telegrams in Chinese. (6) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should notify the consulates of various countries to strictly prevent foreign newspapers from using the position of their embassies and consulates to send reactionary telegrams.

<p>The Anti-Communist Faction's Power Surges The Current Cabinet Cannot Withstand the Pressure The National Press Agency's Helsinki dispatch on the 2nd states that the Finnish government has decided to resign because it feels unable to resist the pressure of the anti-communist movement. Farmers and supporters of veterans' actions are currently gathering in Helsinki to emulate Mussolini in Italy and force the government to ban the Communist Party. It is widely rumored that the director of the National Bank of Finland, Paasikivi, will be appointed to organize a new cabinet. Reuters' Helsinki dispatch on the 2nd states that the Finnish parliament passed a resolution today by a vote of 112 to 69 to ban the printing of communist newspapers. The opposition party is the Social Democratic Party. The government has resigned to form a government on a broader basis. On June 14th, representatives from all over the country met with the president to request (1) banning communist newspapers and organizations, (2) arresting major communist party members, and (3) electing a new parliament to pass the necessary anti-communist laws. Therefore, the president convened a special meeting of parliament on July 1st and ordered the police to immediately seal off communist newspaper offices everywhere. The authorities are also planning to amend the publishing law.</p>

<p>Activities of the National Socialist Party Communist Youth Hold Demonstrations Metalworkers Stage Partial Strike The National Press Agency's Berlin dispatch on the 2nd states that Germany's National Socialist Party, taking advantage of the national celebration of the Rhineland's liberation, engaged in unrestrained demonstrations, causing the festivities to fail to maintain order. All newspapers except those of the extreme left and right factions are extremely indignant. To date, sixty-four party members have been arrested in Berlin, all because these people arbitrarily beat and insulted pedestrians who looked like Jews. In Neumünster near Hamburg, they even clashed with communists and opened fire, resulting in one communist being killed and two injured. As a result, sixteen members of the party were arrested. In addition, twenty-seven people were detained in Breslau and seventy-five were detained in Düsseldorf, all for rioting in public. It is reported that one member of parliament was among those detained in Düsseldorf for inciting friends to attack the police from a balcony. However, the internal division within the party is becoming increasingly apparent. Many leaders do not agree with the party leader's reactionary policies and are withdrawing from the party to join the famous strongman Strasser and obtain the support of the reactionary Count Reventlow. They will form a new party called the National Revolutionary Party to oppose the middle class and capitalism. The National Press Agency's Berlin dispatch on the 2nd states that communist youth demonstrated in front of the Polish Consulate General in Leipzig today, smashing windowpanes and repeatedly shouting slogans of revenge for comrades sentenced to death in Lemberg. By the time the police arrived, the demonstrators had dispersed. The National Press Agency's Berlin dispatch on the 2nd states that the German National People's Party parliamentary group unanimously resolved to oppose the cabinet's financial plan, but the Social Democratic Party will vote in favor, so the plan is expected to pass. Reuters' Berlin dispatch on the 3rd states that 50,000 metalworkers are currently restless due to the implementation of wage cuts, and strikes have been declared in several places, such as the Phoenix-Krupp factory. The metalworkers' union claims to have sufficient reserves to support a long-term strike. It is reported that the German Minister of Labor recently approved a 7.127% wage cut in the steel industry to reduce wages and lower prices, and industrialists have also agreed to reduce the sales prices of their products by the same percentage.</p>
<h3 id="e49">British Colonial Conference <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Reuters' London dispatch on the 2nd states that the sixth plenary session of the Colonial Conference today discussed the issue of imperial wireless and submarine cable services. The Under-Secretary of the Colonial Office stated that Imperial Communications Ltd. has proposed a broad plan to reorganize the submarine cable services of various colonies. This plan has not yet been considered by the British government and must first be considered by the colonial governments before a concrete decision can be made. The chairman of the Colonial Development Advisory Committee and general manager of Imperial Communications Ltd., Blackett, stated that Imperial Communications Ltd. has suffered significant losses in the past six months. The current state of general trade is poor, so this loss is unavoidable. It is estimated that Imperial Communications Ltd. can achieve a net profit of £1.8 million when fully operational. Currently, the cost of maintaining imperial communications by the company is lower than in 1913. Post Office Director-General Phillips stated that the Post Office has accumulated much experience and determined that wireless is cheaper than submarine cables for messages over 2,000 miles, but not as effective as submarine cables. Submarine cables can maintain 24-hour operations, but short-wave wireless cannot. This issue has now been referred to the Stockholders Committee for review. The National Press Agency's London dispatch on the 2nd states that British Prime Minister MacDonald stated in the House of Commons today that the government will temporarily postpone the report of the Hilton Young Commission on the organization of the East Africa Confederation due to the lack of sufficient time this year. This report has recently been making a lot of noise due to the publication of a white paper by the Colonial Office, but Italy and Germany are strongly opposed because the Tangangya region, one of the three regions proposed for merger, is a former German colony and the United Kingdom is only managing it on behalf of the League of Nations. Its final disposal can only be decided by the League of Nations. The Hama Guchi Cabinet of Japan</p>
<h3 id="e50">Anniversary of Cabinet Formation <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Celebration Held at the Prime Minister's Residence Welcome to Plenipotentiaries Wakatsuki and Takarabe The Japan United Press dispatch on the 3rd from Tokyo states that a celebration of the first anniversary of the cabinet's formation and a welcoming party for plenipotentiaries Wakatsuki and Takarabe, who attended the London Conference, were held at the Prime Minister's residence at 6 p.m. yesterday. All cabinet members, including the two plenipotentiaries and advisor Prime Minister Hamaguchi, attended, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 10 p.m. The Telegraphic Communication Agency's Tokyo dispatch on the 3rd states that a dinner party celebrating the first anniversary of the Hamaguchi Cabinet's formation and welcoming plenipotentiaries Wakatsuki and Takarabe, as well as Kawasaki, Director-General of the Legislation Bureau, Yamakawa, a member of the Upper House, Lieutenant General Sakonji, and other members of the London Conference plenipotentiary delegation, was held at the Prime Minister's residence in Nagata-cho at 6 p.m. last night. Cabinet members, Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials, Chief of Naval Operations Taniguchi, and other naval leaders all attended and chatted for over four hours, dispersing after 10 p.m. At the dinner, Prime Minister Hamaguchi praised the achievements of Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki and others regarding the results of the London Treaty, stating that the opposition party and some commentators have strongly criticized him for failing to fully implement the three major principles he advocated. However, it is customary for countries to be unable to fully implement their initial demands at this type of international conference. From a broader perspective, the efforts of Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki and his delegation have achieved what can be called a successful result. The government, and even public opinion, unanimously acknowledge this, and we hereby express our deepest gratitude for the efforts of the members of the plenipotentiary delegation. Wakatsuki then rose on behalf of the plenipotentiary delegation and gave a reply, stating that he was ashamed that he had not been able to fully achieve the results he had hoped for with his meager efforts. He firmly believed that he had not lost the spirit of the government's instructions after thoroughly studying the entire treaty. He expressed his gratitude for the excessive praise from the Prime Minister and the warm sympathy and support from everyone. The Prime Minister then led the guests in chanting "Long live the Emperor!" three times and wished the Cabinet a bright future before the party dispersed. The Telegraphic Communication Agency's Tokyo dispatch on the 3rd states that while the congratulatory dinner party was held at the Prime Minister's residence yesterday, a celebration of the first anniversary of the Cabinet's formation was also held at the headquarters of the Minseito Party. At the party, Secretary-General Tomita issued a statement full of self-praise, stating that after the reckless policies of the Seiyukai Cabinet, the Minseito Cabinet, in just one year, resolutely implemented the difficult issue of lifting the gold embargo and achieved a satisfactory result at the London Naval Conference, which aimed at world disarmament and peace. These are the most notable achievements. Although the impact of the global economic downturn is unavoidable, the government's measures to alleviate unemployment and other economic problems have been effective, and the promotion of domestic products has also been realized. We and our 270 members of parliament must work hard to ensure the long-term survival of the cabinet in order to implement our party's policies. British Members of Parliament</p>

Foreign Secretary Henderson replied that the British government must consider the situation of the agreed-upon date in view of the unrest. Rose also asked whether the British government would return the area to the Nanjing government even if the Nanjing government did not have effective power over Weihaiwei, or whether there was still the possibility of returning it to any other government. The Foreign Secretary replied that the matter would be decided after observing the future situation. The current situation is uncertain and he could not predict what actions the British government would take. Rose further asked whether Weihaiwei could not be returned as stated in the white paper. The Foreign Secretary replied that the honorable member must wait and see.</p>

<p>The Telegraphic Communication Agency's Tokyo dispatch on the 3rd states that President Sengoku of the South Manchurian Railway visited Prime Minister Hamaguchi at his official residence yesterday and advised the Prime Minister on the government's countermeasures to the economic downturn. He said that Finance Minister Inoue's lack of experience and his focus on trivial issues make it difficult to expect a fundamental solution to the economic downturn. However, this type of advice is sure to cause controversy among cabinet members and will cause considerable repercussions. The Finance Minister himself said as if nothing had happened, "I heard that old man Sengoku said that a famous doctor who is proficient in financial matters must be consulted in order to be effective. In fact, today's matter is that the famous doctor himself is suffering from a headache and diarrhea, so how can he make a diagnosis? As for the consultative meeting of financial experts, it has already been held, and old man Sengoku may not know about it.

<p>Wu Mai's Telegram to the Country Regarding the French Sailor Case Addressed to all levels of Party Departments, organizations, groups, schools, and newspapers: In the case of the French sailor shooting and injuring our police officer, a letter was sent to French Consul Boders, saying, "Mr. Boders, I am greatly honored to have been entrusted with the matter in Han Gao before. I have read in the newspaper that the protest of Your Consulate regarding the case of your country's sailor shooting and injuring our country's police officer states, firstly, that in accordance with the treaties signed between China and France, French citizens should be tried by the French authorities, and secondly, that the French sailor cannot be held responsible for firing guns indiscriminately on Erjiaolu, and that our authorities should not only apologize but also punish our conscientious police officer. I am shocked and surprised. It has been investigated that Ge Qing and your country's two artillerymen, who were apprehended at the scene of the incident, are clearly highly suspected of being the perpetrators of the case. Our police officer's immediate arrest was within the scope of his duties and was legally justified. Whether the sailor is guilty or not should be determined by the judgment of our country's judicial authorities. Unexpectedly, after our government has announced the abolition of extraterritoriality, and when our entire nation is vowing to defend the recovery of legal rights, Your Consulate is painstakingly demanding the enforcement of these repealed treaties, which greatly violate the principles of international equality. This is regrettable for the friendship between your country and ours. Furthermore, Your Consulate has ignored the violent behavior of the sailor and instead lodged this unreasonable protest with us, which is even more distressing. I hereby sincerely hope that you will promptly hand over the criminals to our country's court for legal investigation and judgment in order to strengthen diplomatic relations and avoid disputes. This is not only the ardent hope of our people but also the responsibility of your country. I especially send this to express my hopes for a response and wish you well. Wu Mai, Chairman of the Lawyers Association of the Republic of China and Director of Propaganda." It is hoped that everyone will uphold the same position so that the recovery of legal rights within our scope can be truly realized. The country will be fortunate. We are anxiously awaiting your reply. Wu Mai bows. Important News from the East</p>

<h3 id="e66">Central Propaganda Department Hosts the Press <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Shao Yuanchong Reports on Party History Work The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference in the Central Second Conference Room at 2:00 p.m. on the 3rd. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Zhang Tingxiu presided and read the will of Sun Yat-sen, followed by a report by Central Committee member Shao Yuanchong, who stated that the Central Committee had been preparing for a long time for the Party History work. Due to the busy schedule of Party affairs, the Party History and Historical Materials Compilation Committee was established at the end of April this year. Its significance is that every country or social group must have a corresponding history after a considerable period of time. In particular, political parties, labor groups, and social groups in Europe and the United States all have a detailed history after a certain number of years. Based on this, the importance of historical significance is extremely evident. Our party has struggled for decades and has had a significant impact on the country and the people. To date, there is no concrete Party history for the people to understand, which has led to erroneous or deliberately fabricated facts in recent publications about Party history, causing errors in the thinking of young people. The Central Committee, in light of this, established this committee. The first step is to collect, organize, and review the work. Eleven members are recommended by the Central Committee to be responsible for organizing this committee. These eleven members have a long history with the party and are extremely loyal. Among these eleven members, five standing committee members are also recommended. The committee has more than 30 compilers who are divided into specialized compilers and honorary compilers. They are responsible for compiling and collecting materials. In terms of administrative affairs, a secretariat has been formed. In addition, there are two sections for collection and compilation, as well as a historical materials and archives section and a historical materials exhibition room. Currently, the internal organization, except for the exhibition room, is completely organized. As for the work, it is divided into five groups. The first is the Biography Editing Group of Sun Yat-sen, which plans to compile a long biography first. The current focus is on several points: (1) Sun Yat-sen's speeches, actions, and revolutionary program, (2) all the Party's propositions and movements, (3) the general social history of China, (4) the facts of international aggression against China in recent decades. The second is the Party Yearbook Editing Group, the third is the Collection Group, the fourth is the Organization Group, and the fifth is the Review Group. In addition, the work is divided into four types: the work of each compiler at one time, the work of two events, the work of three people, and the work of four places. At the same time, the chronology of Sun Yat-sen is actively completed, and external publications about Party affairs are reviewed. Any errors are corrected. This is a glimpse of the work of the committee since its establishment, and it is presented to everyone for their information. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Course of Constructing the Port of Huludao <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The groundbreaking ceremony for the opening of Huludao Port was held on the 2nd. As reported in yesterday's important telegrams, domestic and international opinion circles have repeatedly discussed the issue of opening this port. This reporter specially investigated the original case with the Ministry of Railways and learned a general overview, which is recorded for reference by those who care about current affairs. Huludao is located at the southwestern end of Jin County in Liaoning Province, on the northwest coast of the Bohai Bay, more than seven miles southeast of the Beining Railway, between Yingkou and Qinhuangdao, occupying an important position economically and militarily. During the Qing Dynasty, when Xu Shichang was the Governor-General of the Three Eastern Provinces, he saw that Dalian Bay was thriving under Japanese management and Yingkou was becoming increasingly sluggish. Therefore, he planned to open an ice-free port along the coast of Fengtian Province. In the summer of the 34th year of Guangxu (1908), he hired British engineer Hughes to survey the area, and Huludao was found to be the most suitable. The plan was adopted by the Qing authorities at that time, and in the second year of Xuantong (1910), the project began with the laying of seven miles of railway tracks between Lianshan and Huludao, and the construction of breakwaters. However, the project was suspended after only one year of construction due to the outbreak of the revolution and the lack of funds. After the establishment of the Republic of China, some construction work was carried out, but from the second to the fourth year of the Republic of China (1913-1915), the road and port business made no progress. In the fifth year of the Republic of China (1916), Chen Yingnan, the general manager of the Tongsu Railway Company, sought to export coal from Jinxi and petitioned the authorities for a port construction plan. By the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919), the European War had ended, and British and American capitalists paid attention to the East Asian issue, and suggested to our country's authorities to build Huludao Seaport and lay the Jin'ai Railway (that is, with Huludao as the starting point). The authorities of the Eastern Provinces then had the plan to build Huludao Port, and the long-standing pending case was therefore brought up again. At the same time, the Ministry of Communications in Beijing also had this proposal. As a result, the Eastern Provinces and the Ministry of Communications jointly organized the project, and the funding was set at 10 million yuan. The Ministry of Communications obtained British understanding and withdrew 5 million yuan from the interests of the Jingfeng Railway, and concluded five outline articles, appointing Zhou Zhaoxiang as the director of the port opening. Later, the project was suspended again due to frequent wars. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922), the Zhili-Fengtian War broke out, and the agreement between the Ministry of Communications and the Eastern Provinces to build the port was cancelled. The Eastern Provinces then operated it independently, but it was interrupted due to financial difficulties. Until the autumn of last year (the 18th year of the Republic of China, 1929), when Sun Zhesheng, the Minister of Railways, inspected the Beining, Banhan, PingSui, and other roads, he went to Shenyang to discuss with Zhang Xueliang, the authority of the Northeast. After the Beining Railway was unified and managed by the Ministry, he also considered that the Huludao port opening policy was included in the Premier's industrial plan, which was very important for the development of the Beining Road's business and the Northeast's foreign transportation. Therefore, it was agreed that 500,000 yuan would be retained monthly from the Beining Road's business surplus as a special fund for operating the Huludao project. In January of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), Gao Jiyi, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, and the representative of the Dutch Port Management Company in China signed a contract in Tianjin to build the Huludao Seaport, with a funding of 6.4 million US dollars. The main points of this construction project are as follows: (1) The south section of the breakwater is 4,100 feet long, and the southwest section is 1,000 feet long. (2) The total length of the wharf wall in the port is 3,700 feet. (3) The working wharf is 900 feet long. (4) The guide dike, north of the working wharf in the port, is 2,360 feet long, and the one west of Banlashan is 2,500 feet long. (5) A part of the waterway in the port is dredged to 27 feet below zero, and a part to 32 feet below zero. The port gate waterway is dredged to 30 feet below zero, with a bottom width of 650 feet and a length of about 1,500 feet, to a depth of 30 feet below zero at the seabed. (6) The Dagwa and the near-sea areas, and the area between the breakwater and the wharf wall, are filled to 22 feet above zero. (7) Banlashan and Gaoliangtou Dui, these two mountains are leveled to 22 feet above zero. According to the contract, all projects are scheduled to be completed before October 15th of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935). At the same time, a port affairs office is specially set up under the Beining Railway Bureau to manage the port affairs projects of Huludao and Yingkou, which are affiliated to the road. Lin Yimin is appointed by the Ministry of Railways as the director and chief engineer of the office, and Ning Wu is the deputy director. The office has two sections, affairs and engineering, and several engineers to take charge of the project. This project has started in May of this year and is scheduled to hold a groundbreaking ceremony on July 2nd. Minister Sun of the Ministry of Railways invited Wu Tiecheng to participate in the ceremony as a representative. Thus, the long-cherished wish of many years has been realized again. The Three Eastern Provinces have long been in the hands of Japan and Russia. In recent years, the railways built by themselves, such as the Shenhai, Jihai, Qike, Datong, and Taosuo lines, as well as the Beining Line, the only trunk line in the Northeast, have all become the cultivation lines of the Zhongdong and Manchu Railways. In particular, the Manchu Railway receives the benefits of our railways. In the future, after the completion of Huludao, the dependence on others in the past can be replaced by having our own seaport to swallow goods. It is truly of great significance to the prosperity of transportation in the Northeast and the national economy and people's livelihood.</p>
<h3 id="e68">The Fujian Navy and Army Jointly Attack Lu's Troops <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Liu Heding advances from eastern Fujian.</p>
<p>Fang Shengtang advances from southern Fujian.</p>
<p>Lu Xingrong defends alone.</p>
<p>Lin Zhong resigns from all concurrent positions.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the National Government explicitly ordered that the navy and army under Lu's command in Fujian plan to advance, it is now found that this general attack is divided into two routes. The eastern Fujian route is under the responsibility of Liu Heding, who will take Gutian and Yanping from Minqing and Yongtai, and the arrangements have been completed. The military supplies and salaries supplied by the headquarters have also been transported, and they can advance as soon as the order is given. The southern Fujian route is under the responsibility of Fang Shengtang. After arriving in Xiamen, Fang immediately convened representatives Zhang Zhen, Xiao Shuxuan, and Chen Guohui (Chen's arrest warrant has now been revoked by the National Government) to hold a military meeting. It was decided that all of Xiao and Chen's troops would be dispatched, and Fang would personally take command. Zhang would be responsible for the rear supply, and would also send troops to assist when necessary. In order to facilitate military operations, the two troops were reorganized into wartime formations, with each troop reorganized into two detachments, with each detachment consisting of two battalions. Once the provincial government launches the attack, Chen's troops will enter Youxi from Dehua, and Xiao's troops will enter Datian from Anxi at the same time, so that Lu's troops will be attacked from both sides. It is planned that the eastern Fujian route will first attack Yanping, and the southern Fujian route will first attack Youxi, in order to break Lu's base. The rest will be easy to solve. As for the Haiyan aircraft, it has arrived in Fujian for many days. According to visitors to the pilot of this aircraft, after the aircraft arrived on the 15th, it went to the front line on the 16th to distribute leaflets, and on the 17th, it carried four bombs to attack the enemy's position. On the morning of the 18th, it drove to Baisha and looked down at the enemy troops gathered in the temple below, and bombed the temple with bombs, killing many enemies. At the same time, it felt thick smoke rushing upwards in the air, presumably the enemy was shooting with rifles, but the rifles could only reach 2,000 meters, and the aircraft was flying between 3,500 meters and 4,000 meters, so how could it hit? On the 19th, it went to inspect the upper reaches of Baisha and found four steamships and sparrow boats with the flag of Lu Xinming's headquarters hanging on them. It quickly dropped a bomb on one of them, and the rest scattered. On the 20th, it went to scout and found that the enemy had retreated. On the 11th, it went to Baisha again and found no trace of the enemy. It is also said that there are three aircraft transported to Fujian this time. In addition to the Haiyan, which has already flown, the rest are being assembled at the Mawei Aircraft Factory. The horsepower and speed are better than the Haiyan.</p>
<p>As for Lu's troops, Lu Xingming did not agree with the detention of the members of the provincial government, so he went elsewhere beforehand. Lu Xingbang did not agree to start a war with Liu Heding's division, and has returned to Youxi after the war. Now all the military affairs of Lu's side are presided over by Lu Xingrong alone. Lu believes that the failure of this attack on the provincial capital was also due to the poor quality of the military equipment. For example, the barrel of a rifle would be burst by the heat after firing, making it unusable. Even the bullets would sometimes misfire and fly backwards out of the barrel. The cannons could not bloom or aim accurately, and only a hollow sound was heard, and the shells drilled into the soil intact. It is found that most of these guns and bullets were manufactured by Chen Zhongcong, the chief of the staff, when he was the director of the Huangdian Arsenal. At that time, more than one million yuan was spent, but only such products were produced. Therefore, Lu's troops were angry and took the Yanping factory technician Li and the Youxi factory supervisor Zheng to Youxi for investigation. At the same time, because there were many casualties in this war, rebellious soldiers and bandits were specially recruited to supplement the troops. The recruits who have been recruited include Chen Guocun's rebellious regiment in Shuikou, Zhou Zhiqun's rebellious brigade in Yanping, and about 1,000 bandits from Wu Da'ang and Huang Qilan, who are guarding Yongtai. They are still in a stalemate with the Lishui police team under Liang Jichuan. Xu Feilong and Fei Feng's two groups of more than 1,000 people are guarding Dehua, and are currently fighting with Zhang Zhen's division and Lin Qinglong's regiment. As for Gutian, it is guarded by Chen Rongbiao's regiment, and Youxi is guarded by Ye Xingxin's regiment. Behind them, the defenses of Shaowu and Jian'ou are under the responsibility of Huang Qingcai and Cheng Bingyao's regiments. Therefore, these two regiments are both from Minqing, and Lu Xingrong does not trust them very much. Lin Zhong, the brigade commander of the 1st Marine Brigade and the commander of the provincial defense, was also one of those who advocated the detention of the members of the provincial government and the provincial party department during the January 6th coup in the provincial capital. This war has not shown any signs of maintaining local security. However, he suddenly submitted his resignation to the Marine Corps Command and the provincial government, resigning from his positions as brigade commander of the 1st Brigade and commander of the provincial defense. It has been approved, and the provincial defense headquarters has been explicitly abolished by the provincial government. The headquarters of the 1st Brigade is planning to transfer Jin Zhenzhong, the regiment commander of the 1st Regiment of the brigade, to be promoted to the position, and Lin will be transferred to be a senior advisor to the headquarters.

<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The communist bandits entrenched in the Mabu, Dushan, and Liubo areas southwest of Liu'an were repelled last month by the newly编第5旅潘善齋部 and the people's self-defense团. Before long, the bandits came back with a vengeance. A large number of communist bandits were recently discovered near Potangdi, 15 li from Sujiabu. The government troops are strictly guarding the river bank in Sujiabu. The entire 3rd Regiment of the 5th New Brigade, Pan Shanzhai's troops, were originally stationed in the Guanjia Ferry area in the southern township of Huoshan and the Xiafu Bridge area in the northern township. The 3rd team leader of the People's Self-Defense Regiment, Zhu Menggong, was originally stationed in Qingshan, and the 2nd team leader, Liu Xiushan, was originally stationed in Lianhua Temple. However, Sujiabu is an important fortress for transportation, and it is not enough to defend it without heavy troops. Therefore, the 1st Regiment and the independent battalion of the 5th New Brigade were stationed there to patrol day and night. Zhu Peng, the magistrate of Liu'an County, was stationed in Sujiabu to command. Pan Shanzhai, the brigade commander of the 5th New Brigade, led the independent battalion and Lu Qintang's troops to be stationed in Liu'an. Battalion Commander Lu also served as the garrison commander of Liu'an City, maintaining the security of the county seat. Recently, it was reported that the communist bandits' plainclothes team suddenly occupied Dianshan Xiafu Bridge, and then occupied Qingshan Town in Liu'an (50 li from the city). The self-defense regiment retreated to Kangjia Bridge (25 li from the city). As a result, the people in Liu'an were panic-stricken. Pan Shousan, the regiment commander of the 3rd Regiment of the 5th New Brigade, led his troops to counterattack and quickly repelled the communist bandits and recaptured Qingshan Town. However, the area south of Qingshan is still being cleared. (July 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e71">General Shareholder Vote of the Steamboat Company <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Ho Tung elected as chairman of the board.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Steamboat Company, which travels between Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macau, convened a general shareholder vote on June 24 to decide on Ho Tung's proposal to "take back the Chinese cargo and passenger business for the company to operate on its own or to transfer it to new contractors." It is found that the origin of the voting meeting was that the company held an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on March 4, and the majority approved Ho's proposal. However, the chairman of the company believed that many shareholders from afar were not present to vote and did not approve the passage, and it was necessary to convene a formal vote of all shareholders or representatives to resolve the issue. Therefore, it was changed to June 24. On the day of the vote, the voting inspectors Guan Yaoguang were selected by Ho's side first, and the voting inspector Blaton was selected by the other side to inspect the number of shares, the number of votes, and supervise everything. The voting started at 11 o'clock. The total number of shares in the company was 80,000 shares. Except for 3,447 shares that were transferred after March 4 and lost their voting rights according to the rules, the number of shares with voting rights on that day was actually 76,553 shares. The Western shareholders who attended the voting were Maiqi Xia Weishi Hualun Luoda, etc., and the Chinese shareholders were He Dong Li Zifang Luo Wenjin Liu Yulin, etc. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, Chairman Maiqi arrived and announced the end of the voting. The voting results were calculated on the spot. The number of votes for Ho Tung's side was 53,082 shares, or 6,387 votes, the number of votes for the other side was 8,945 shares, or 1,319 votes, and the number of neutral votes was 13,026 shares, or 1,859 votes. According to the statistics, the number of votes for Ho Tung was 44,137 shares more than the other side, or 5,068 votes. Ho Tung's proposal was officially passed. In addition, the directors of the company held a board meeting in the conference room on the 25th and immediately elected Ho Tung as the new chairman of the board. After this case was decided, all the Chinese cargo and passenger business was taken back by the company for its own operation, and the board of directors entrusted Ho with full power to handle it. Attached is Ho Tung's proposal to the shareholders on December 2, 1929, as follows: (A) It is about the renewal of the contract between the company's ships and the Chinese passengers and cargo and the former contractor, but because the contractor competes with the company for business, it is detrimental to the company's interests. (B) The shareholders hereby notify the board of directors to cancel this method and formulate a new method to give priority to those who do not compete with the company and give them a new contract or take back the company's own operation.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Suspicion Issues of the Xu Zhuoran Case <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Jimei schools help Ye Yuan.</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence on the 30th: The case of Xu Zhuoran's assassination has been ordered by the National Government to be thoroughly investigated and arrested by the Fujian Provincial Government and the Zhangxia Naval Police. In Fujian Province, it is a rare and serious case. When Xu was assassinated, Chen Yanxiang, the director of Jimei School and the manager of Tong'an Tongmei Automobile Company, was detained by the police at the request of Xu's family on suspicion and sent to the court for investigation. Xu accompanied Chen Yanxiang from Tong'an to Jimei School to visit Ye Yuan on the evening of the 27th, and stayed at the school that night to discuss important matters in Xiamen the next day. At about 5:00 a.m. on the 28th, he accompanied Chen to Antai Heshuitou. Ye first went to Xiamen and left a name card at the Jimei Station with the words "Telephone No. 870, Fengyi Qianzhuang, Taishi Lane." Xu and Chen arrived in Xiamen at 1:00 p.m. and came to Fengyi with Chen, and Xu was assassinated outside the door in front of Fengyi. Xu's family believes that outsiders do not know about the meeting between Xu and Ye in Xiamen. Ye's name card has an address but no reason, and there is no name of Xu Zhuoran who received the name card. The meeting between Xu and Ye in Fengyi is only a tacit agreement and is not known to outsiders. It is believed that Ye has a suspicion of arranging a murder in advance. As for Chen Yanxiang, it is believed that he deliberately delayed the time at the Meirengong Station for more than ten minutes, and Xu waited downstairs before accompanying Xu to Fengyi. When he arrived at the Hengsheng Street intersection, he asked to lead the way forward for nearly ten steps, and Xu was assassinated outside the door after Chen entered the Fengyi gate. It is believed that Chen deliberately delayed the time at the station so that the front of the Fengyi gate could be arranged calmly, and that the lead should be parallel and should not go forward for nearly ten steps, deliberately avoiding the danger of conspiring to assassinate. After Ye was arrested, all the teachers and staff of Jimei requested bail, and the students also sent representatives to request bail, but the court refused. Teachers and staff, such as teachers and directors, resigned, and students went on strike to help Ye. School Principal Chen Jiageng repeatedly telegraphed the headquarters, the court, and Xu's funeral office to ease Ye's situation. Ye also issued a statement stating that he was separated from Jimei School because of the Xu case, and stated that he and Xu were close friends. This time, Xu came to discuss the fundraising for the teaching group and had to go to Xiamen to discuss the joint lease of the Tongmei car road with the Anxi Automobile Company. He did not know when Xu would come on the morning of the 28th. If something had to be done first, leaving a name card was to show the address so that he could call to contact him. There is no such thing as arranging a murder. As for Chen Delin, who was captured by the teaching group in Tong'an, he claimed that Ye Yuan and Chen Yanxiang were the masterminds, and that he was entrusted by Ye to find assassins. As a result, he found three people. When Xu was assassinated, he was on the scene to supervise the plan, which was all made by Ye and Chen. After Chen Delin confessed, the Siming District Court of Xiamen entrusted the Tong'an Judicial Office to review the confession. The confession was the same as before, and the confession was very long. The Zhangxia Police Headquarters twice increased the reward to 2,000 yuan for arresting the murderer in the Xu case. After Chen Delin confessed the names and addresses of the three murderers, Lin Ming, the captain of the detective team of Siming County, Xiamen, led all the detectives and 16 members of the Public Security Bureau's Browning team to capture Lin Luo, one of the shooters, in Neilin Township, Tong'an, on the morning of the 22nd, and escorted him to the headquarters. After two interrogations by the military law office and one court interrogation, the secret confession was made. The Jimei School and Tong'an schools jointly organized a Ye Aid Committee and issued a declaration to defend Ye, saying that Chen Delin had a grudge against Ye and falsely accused him, and that Delin had a good impression of Xu Zhuoran. Ye had no reason to use Chen to kill Xu. However, on the 27th, Xu's funeral office issued a telegram from Xu Zhuoran's wife, also strongly pointing out that Ye and Chen committed a major suspicion of murder, and urged the authorities to speed up the execution. On the 29th, Ye also issued a letter to School Principal Chen Jiageng, saying, "Chen Delin falsely accused me of conspiring with Yanxiang three weeks before the assassination of Xu, telling me in the Science Museum (Jimei School) that he wanted to deal with Xu and wanted to find a brave person. Lin Luo was introduced by him, and then Lin Ke and Lin Yuan were introduced by Lin Luo. Yanxiang had disagreements with the recent reasons for the civil nine turmoil and the Tong'an Education Association elections. As for Xu, he recently relied on Xu to argue with Regiment Commander Xiao to get his job back when he was investigated by the army because of the Tongmei car road. Chen Fangde Xu was too busy, how could he conspire with me to kill Xu? Delin is closer to Xu than to me, and has a deep grudge against me. How can he conspire with me to kill Xu? Pan Tu (affiliated to the inland) is a place of evil, stealing my cattle and wood from the agricultural and forestry school. I have filed a case in Tong'an, how can I ask Tu Pan to kill the reason why the four parties can never work together and falsely accuse them of conspiring to assassinate? How can there be such a thing in the world? Also, Delin confessed that the reason why I killed Xu was because Xu destroyed my Tong'an Anxi liaison plan. I have been concentrating on Jimei school affairs for ten years as one day. I have never heard of any party, government, or military matters. What is the so-called Anxi Tong'an liaison plan?" This case is still under investigation by all parties, and all parties are paying close attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Quick Letter from Hangzhou <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>

Chief Zhu of the sub-bureau held a preliminary hearing, and all three confessed to smoking opium. They were immediately prepared for transfer to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the County Government for interrogation. Bizarre Murder Case: Suspect Arrested: Wen Da, grandson of Qiang Tingzhi, a resident of Figure 573, Qiangjiaqiao, Meicun Town, Beixia Township, of the county, was eight years old and attending a nearby primary school. He did not return after school at 5:00 PM on the 20th of last month and could not be found. On the 30th, Wen Da's body was found in a river near Meicun. His skin color had changed and his condition was miserable. Qiang Tingzhi ordered someone to retrieve the body and place it on the shore, while investigating the cause of Wen Da's death. It was discovered that Cha Xiangchu, a nearby villager, was suspected of kidnapping. However, Cha had already gone to the city the next day and stayed at the Mengyuan Inn on the road. Qiang immediately tracked him down the next morning, found Cha, and dragged him to the Second Sub-Bureau of Public Security, requesting an investigation. Chief Sun of the sub-bureau held a preliminary hearing. Qiang Tingzhi provided the same information as before. Cha Xiangchu claimed that he did not know Wen Da and that Qiang was fabricating accusations.

Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, someone named Jia from Jiangyin, a large soil dealer, brought a large quantity of opium weighing more than 500 taels, worth more than a thousand yuan, to Wuxi and hid near the Gongyun Bridge outside the Guangfu Gate at the Wuxi Hotel. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by detectives from a certain agency in the county. Several men in plain clothes went to the hotel to conduct a search, and all the opium, more than 500 taels, was seized. The soil dealer, because the matter violated prohibitions, had no choice but to let them take it and dared not speak out. Detective Chief Shot and Killed in the Capture of Bandits: Recently, there have been kidnapping cases in Yixing County. Sun, the county magistrate of the county, sent police to investigate and discovered that the kidnappings were carried out by bandits from Liao Jiatang in the eastern district of Heqiao in the county.

<p>To the Editor: I read a news article in the Wuxi Local Communications column of your newspaper on May 14 entitled "Incompetent Doctor Kills Patient", which stated that Shen Qiqing's son recently contracted a cold and died after being subjected to spinal taps by Dr. Qian Baohua for two consecutive days. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. An investigation revealed that Shen's child fell ill early in the morning on February 7 with symptoms clearly indicative of meningitis. Letters to our association from Western doctors Li Kele and Tan Shumo, who provided follow-up consultations, can prove this. Dr. Qian only treated the child twice on February 7th and 8th. Afterwards, more than 30 Chinese and Western doctors successively provided consultations. He eventually died on May 10 due to an insufficient number of serum injections. This was more than three months after Dr. Qian's initial consultation. The report in your newspaper stated that the death was immediate and had no basis. It also stated that the Shen family would resolve the matter through legal means, which is completely unfounded. In short, the Shen family runs a Chinese medicine business and has always been biased against Western medicine. When their beloved son suddenly contracted severe meningitis and Chinese medicine was ineffective, they reluctantly sought help from Western medicine. Unaware that severe meningitis, after one or two spinal taps and serum injections, would only initially alleviate the condition and that further treatment was still required to eradicate the disease, the family did not heed the advice and turned to Chinese medicine. As a result, the root cause of the disease was not eliminated, it became chronic, and the child became incurable. The family mistakenly blamed Dr. Qian, falsely believing that spinal fluid was the essence of the human body and that removing the essence would prevent the body from recovering. This led to a dispute and the spreading of defamatory rumors to slander him. Our association has dispatched personnel to investigate all aspects of the matter and has clearly held a public meeting for a fair discussion. The results of the discussion have been made into an assessment report, which has been distributed to all sectors of society and published in various local newspapers in our city so that the truth and medical principles can be clarified, eliminating various suspicions and misunderstandings in society and preventing the obstruction of legitimate Western medical treatment in the future. This matter concerns the credibility of the entire Western medical community and the personal reputation of Qian Baohua, and so I have summarized it. I sincerely request that you publish this in the Wuxi Local News column to show fairness and impartiality. The Wuxi Medical Association respectfully submits this on July 1st. Educational News</p>

<p>Ministry of Education Promotes Phonetic Symbols: Committee's Second Discussion Meeting Circumstances: The Ministry of Education is actively promoting phonetic symbols and has sought opinions from various parties to gather ideas. The Ministry of Education's Phonetic Symbol Promotion Committee held its second discussion meeting a few days ago, and all discussions yielded considerable results. The minutes of the second discussion meeting are recorded below. The meeting started at 3:00 PM that afternoon. Attendees were Chiang Menglin, Wu Zhihui, Liu Luyin (representing Fang Zhi), Zhao Yuanren, Zhang Shiyi, Dai Yingguan, Wang Ruichang, Guo Youshou, and Peng Baichuan.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Discussion Items and Results <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>(I) The National Mandarin Education Promotion Association suggests that the Ministry of Education establish a Mandarin Phonetic Symbols Teacher Training Institute. (Discussion Result) Researching Western phonetic symbols and researching Mandarin are two separate matters. Anyone wishing to research Mandarin may be designated by the Ministry to study at several Mandarin schools with proven results in China (such as the Shanghai Foch Road and Hartung Road Mandarin School, etc.). As for requesting the Ministry to establish a Mandarin Phonetic Symbols Teacher Training Institute, the matter is postponed for now. (II) Chuan He and others suggest: 1. Seek to improve the writing system so that phonetic symbols are permanently attached to the side of the character (or above and below the character). (Discussion Result) Already adopted, no further discussion needed. 2. Imitate the "katakana" method of Japanese writing to gradually promote Mandarin phonetic symbols. (Discussion Result) Can be imitated. 3. Notify all printing businesses to modify the typefaces, uniformly adding phonetic symbols to the side of the characters. (Discussion Result) To be handled accordingly. 4. Encourage the newspaper industry to add phonetic symbols to the side of characters within a feasible scope. (Discussion Result) To be handled accordingly. 5. Order subordinate agencies, schools, and organizations to uniformly add phonetic symbols next to the characters when issuing documents to the public in the future. (Discussion Result) To be promoted gradually. 6. Petition the central government to instruct all sectors, including agency names, shop signs, and propaganda slogans, advertisements, etc., to add phonetic symbols to the side of the characters (or above and below the characters). (Discussion Result) To be promoted as soon as possible. 7. When encountering resistance to the promotion, government decrees should be used to assist at any time and place. (Discussion Result) To be handled accordingly. (III) Peng Jianong suggests abolishing the three phonetic symbols 万, 兀, and 广, replacing 万 with 丿 for the rising tone, 兀 with V for the rising tone, and 广 with a space for the departing tone, adding them after each sound. (Discussion Result) Because dialects have five tones, they cannot be replaced. (IV) Lu Zhongyuan suggests that the four tones of characters must be marked when promoting phonetic symbols. (Discussion Result) Agreed. (V) Qiu Yi-wu, Zhou Weiji, and others suggest retaining the entering tone. (Discussion Result) Agreed. (VI) He Shuda suggests that since the national phonetic alphabet has been changed to phonetic symbols, initials, finals, and compound finals should be changed to initial symbols, final symbols, and compound final symbols, and tones should be changed to tone marks. (Discussion Result) Labeling initials, finals, and compound finals can be called initial symbols, final symbols, and compound final symbols. Symbols labeling tones can be called tone marks. Phonetic symbols labeling the national pronunciation can be called standard symbols. Symbols labeling dialectal additions can be called dialectal symbols. (VII) Wang Zuyou submitted phonetic fanqie direct charts. (Discussion Result) Can be used for reference. (VIII) Wang Zuyou suggests: 1. Request the Ministry of Education to instruct all provincial and municipal departments and bureaus to solicit people who are familiar with dialects, have a basic understanding of ancient rhymes, and have a deep understanding of the usage of phonetic symbols to appoint a dialect investigator for each county to create a form and fill in the investigation items one by one. At the same time, the investigator should be appointed as a phonetic symbol guidance specialist, requiring them to report the key points of the guidance results and investigation results to the provincial and municipal departments and bureaus every month, and then the provincial and municipal departments and bureaus will report to the Ministry of Education, which will forward them to the Phonetic Symbol Promotion Committee to collect and compile dialect courses by province. 2. In addition to complying with the order to add instruction in phonetic symbols, each school should also set up a dialect course to identify and annotate each character that can be spoken but cannot be written, so that the spoken and written language can easily converge. As for normal schools, a phonetic course of 360 hours should be required, with half taught in each of the first and second semesters, with a conclusion in the middle. Secondary and vocational schools should receive 180 hours. Senior administrative officials in each province and region should also convene a phonetic symbol training class with a study period of three months. The phonetic course should also be at least 180 hours. Students in each school who fail the phonetic symbol course will not be allowed to advance or be employed (but the phonetic course must also include dialect to broaden its use). 3. The content of the phonetic symbol textbook for civilian literacy should always promote the national pronunciation without abandoning dialects, be suitable for civilian application of common knowledge, and facilitate recitation. 4. Request the Ministry of Education to instruct all provincial and municipal departments and bureaus to instruct their subordinates to set up more phonetic literacy centers and civilian reading rooms (the characters in books and newspapers should uniformly use the national pronunciation on the right and the dialect pronunciation on the left to facilitate the recognition of the national pronunciation from the dialect and then the recognition of characters, that is, official notices should also use this method. 5. Each county education bureau is responsible for setting up more compulsory schools and sending more voluntary teachers, limiting the period from a certain month of this year to a certain month of a certain year as the period for civilian literacy in each county, and those who fail to implement the plan will be dismissed from their posts to show punishment. (Discussion Result) The above suggestions are not without merit and should be carefully considered and adopted separately. New appointee of the Jiangsu Education Department</p>

<h3 id="e93">Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Textbook Compiled <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The "Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Textbook" has now been compiled by the Compilation and Review Department of the Ministry of Education and submitted to the Central Training Department for review before printing. The compilation situation is excerpted below: (1) Before the book was compiled, more than 1,000 commonly used characters were selected from 630,000 characters as the basis for the words used in the book. (2) The book uses precise methods to select the necessary common knowledge of the Three Principles of the People, natural history, geography, hygiene, and other subjects as the material for the textbook. (3) The book is divided into two types, one for children and one for adults, each with 88 lessons divided into four volumes. (4) The book has two purposes: first, to provide people with literacy, and second, to popularize the Three Principles of the People, so the compilation is extremely difficult. In addition, the book was ordered by the Central Government to be compiled by the end of June this year, and the compilation period for the department was only four months. Because the time was short, shortcomings are inevitable, so the current book is designated as a provisional edition. After it is printed and experimented for one year, it is planned to make a thorough revision.</p>

<p>Constructing New Dormitories, Increasing Budget</p>
<p>Adding Research Institutes, Improving Curriculum</p>
<p>(Tangshan Correspondence) Since Dr. Li Shutian took office as the president of the Tangshan Civil Engineering College of Jiaotong University in this city on May 10, he has actively rectified all matters within the college, holding successive college affairs meetings and teaching affairs meetings to formulate various plans in order to realize them one by one in the shortest possible time. The following is a summary of the most important ones:</p>
<p>Planning Development Plans: Former President Li Houshen had a draft of the college affairs plan, and all professors jointly drafted a five-year development plan. Professor Chen Maokang also drafted a plan himself. Recently, in order to demonstrate the spirit of cooperation and draw on collective wisdom, all faculty and staff jointly drafted a five-year development plan for the college, which is currently a draft.</p>
<p>Improving the Original Curriculum: In order to meet the needs of the community and seek its own progress, the college has greatly improved the original curriculum and formulated a new curriculum table, which was approved by the Teaching Affairs Meeting and scheduled to be implemented in the 20th year of the Republic of China. As for the 19th year, in consideration of the subjects that students have already learned and have not yet learned, a transitional curriculum table has been formulated for application.</p>
<p>In order to cultivate independent research transportation engineering specialists who are needed for the material construction in the national strategy and to promote transportation technology inventions that are suitable for national conditions and to increase the transportation engineering science needed by the world and mankind, the Institute of Transportation Engineering of Jiaotong University was established in accordance with the organizational outline of Jiaotong University, and twenty articles of the organizational outline were formulated and passed by the College Affairs Meeting. The application has been submitted to the Shanghai General School for review, and it is reported that researchers will be recruited after the summer vacation this year.</p>
<p>Construction of Student Dormitories: In order to increase the opportunity for young people in China to study, the college plans to build four student dormitories in the next few years and plans to build the entire college. The general plan of the college building has been entrusted to the Tianjin Jintai Engineering Company for drawing, and it has been revised and approved by the College Affairs Meeting. The construction will begin after the summer vacation. However, this construction will take at least until the spring of next year to be used, so a temporary dormitory will be built during the summer vacation for application after the start of school after the summer vacation.</p>
<p>Increase in the Annual Budget: The college's current operating expenses are 11,000 yuan per month. Now, due to the planned expansion, in addition to the need to apply for additional funds, the operating expenses have also increased. It is reported that the budget for the 19th year has been drafted and set at 14,000 yuan per month. The increased amount is mostly used for the purchase of books and instruments.</p>
<p>Increase in Sanitary Equipment: In order to increase the health of all faculty and students in the college, the college has requested a certain company in Tianjin to design an increase in the college's sanitary equipment, which is divided into (1) sanitary appliances (2) ditch project (3) tap water project (4) hot water project, totaling about 28,000 yuan. The specifications and plan drawings have been submitted to the Shanghai General School for approval and are expected to be implemented in the near future. Dr. Li Shutian, President of the College, set off for Shanghai on the 21st of this month to discuss various important matters with President Sun Ke. It is expected that there will be a new atmosphere after the start of school after the summer vacation. (Issued on June 26)</p>

<p>Since Zhijiang University resumed operations last fall, it has been actively handling transfer procedures and preparing for filing. It is reported that the original three departments of liberal arts, sciences, and business established by the school cannot raise enough operating expenses for a while in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry, so the liberal arts and sciences college will be filed first, and the business department will be temporarily attached to the economics department of the liberal arts department. The enrollment for the next semester has also been changed to the name of the college of science to comply with the regulations of the Ministry. It is reported that the filing document was sent to the Zhejiang Education Department last week for submission to the Ministry of Education.

<p>Municipal Government Asks Construction Committee for Discussion.</p>
<p>The issue of educational rights in the concessions was previously proposed by Chen Dezheng, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and the Citizens' Federation suggested it to the Municipal Government. However, the Municipal Government considered the matter important and specially asked the Construction Discussion Committee to include it in the agenda to make it perfect. The original letter is excerpted as follows: We have previously received a letter from your committee stating that Commissioner Chen Dezheng proposed to recover the educational rights in the Shanghai concessions. The 9th Standing Committee Meeting of our association has decided to send a letter to the Municipal Government for consideration and handling. The original proposal is enclosed for verification and handling. Upon receiving this, the Municipal Government had already considered this case. Later, it received a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a proposal from the Education Bureau and the Preparatory Committee of the Citizens' Federation of the Special Zone of this city. After detailed consideration, it was considered that the matter involved foreign affairs and that it was necessary to gather wisdom and conduct practical research to avoid inappropriate measures. It is planned that the Municipal Government will organize a committee to invite prominent figures from all walks of life and Chinese directors of the concessions as consultants, and appoint the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, the Director of the Education Bureau, and the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau as members of the committee to jointly discuss concrete measures and submit them to the Municipal Government for approval before negotiating with the concession authorities to promote the smooth and far-reaching achievement of the recovery of educational rights.

We should ask your committee to include them in the agenda of the next meeting and submit them for discussion to make them perfect. The original letter is enclosed, along with the letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the report and attachments from the Education Bureau and the Preparatory Committee of the Citizens' Federation of the Special Zone of this city.

The number of students did not increase due to the large number of expulsions last year, but the performance was better than in the past. Then, diplomas and awards were given. More than ten students, including Luo Youlong, Wu Renjun, Wang Fuxiao, Jiang Fengqing, Li Yingji, and Li Youying, received honors and were exempted from tuition fees. The school's summer school is scheduled to start on July 8th. The number of applicants for the autumn semester is increasing day by day. For details, please write to the school at Meibaige Road, Racecourse, for information.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center moved to its new location at the intersection of Hualong Road and Huanlong Road, it has been operating as usual. Matters such as vocational talks and educational guidance are particularly busy due to the summer vacation. The "Educational Guidance" published by the Center has sold more than 5,000 copies in the Center and various bookstores in less than a week. For the convenience of young people from all over the country and in this city to purchase and read, the Center has entrusted Civilization, Commercial Press, various county education bureaus, and Qixin, Qingyun, and Xinya bookstores in this city to sell them on its behalf. The Center is currently compiling and printing a volume of vocational guidance lectures, which mainly discusses the four major issues of youth's education, employment, service, and self-cultivation. The materials are particularly refined and rich and will also be published soon. At present, vocational guidance centers have been established in Nanjing, Suzhou, Qingdao, Wuxi, Jiading, etc. It is reported that various centers are discussing ways to communicate in order to study various plans. Regarding the introduction of jobs, there are several cases in Zhejiang Province asking to look for fishery technical talents and teachers who can tutor English and arithmetic at home. Sports</p>

<h3 id="e107">Japanese Expedition <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Players' Performance at Harbin: Discus and Shot Put Inferior to Russians, Yasushiba's 800 Meters Suppressed by Wang Mingshen. A group of twenty athletes from the Harbin delegation, who are to participate in the International Student Games to be held in Darmstadt on August 7th of this year, arrived at Harbin at 8:00 AM on the 25th.  They took a break at the Nagoya Hotel, using it as a resting place. After resting for three hours, they went to the First Sports Field for practice at around 11:00 AM, stopping at 12:40 PM due to the urgency of catching the 3:35 PM Eurasian train. They then left the field and returned to their residences.  The audience was enthusiastic. Although it was only a practice session, the scale was no less impressive than previous public sports meetings. Generally, Chinese and foreign sports enthusiasts, feeling the interest in sports, took time out of their busy schedules to watch. By around 10:00 AM, the stands were packed with over two thousand Chinese, Japanese, and Russian spectators. The Japanese Consulate sent a secretary, Mr. So-and-so, and key members of the residents' association to greet and assist in advance. All order within the field was maintained by the Japanese. Therefore, apart from enthusiastic applause for exciting events, there was no noise or commotion that day. At around 11:00 AM, the Japanese athletes, led by their coach, entered the field by car. Chinese and foreign spectators simultaneously welcomed them with applause. The athletes were all dressed in blue flannel suits, with white badges bearing red characters pinned on their left lapels.  Fragmentary Performances: After entering the preparation room and changing, the athletes entered the field for practice. However, it was merely physical training and not according to a set program. However, their brilliant skills were already visible in their fragmentary performances. For example, Yoshioka Ryutoku's 100-meter sprint was exceptionally fast at the start. Within the first five meters, his waist was arched and his body bent. Beyond five meters, his body began to straighten slightly, using his elasticity to spring out very quickly. He tried running twice against Wu Jingyao (a short-distance runner with a time of 11.7 seconds), and Wu was left far behind. The key to short-distance running lies in the effectiveness of the start. Judging from Yoshioka's start, even if Liu Changchun of our country had not injured his leg, he would probably be no match for him. Kakutani Hachi and Yasushiba Haruo tried running the 1,500 meters with broad strides. Their graceful and composed demeanor was excellent. Sumiyoshi Kosaku tried throwing the javelin, tossing it lightly and sending it far beyond 140 or 150 feet. Oda Mikio's long jump involved stepping off and soaring very high, and he could move his feet back and forth in the air.</p>
<p>Japanese Track and Field Team's Entrance for Performance in Harbin</p>
<p>After landing, his feet could still be joined together. Oshima Kamakichi's skills were similar. The others' trial jumps were all above 22 feet. Kimura Kazuo, Oda Mikio, and others tried high jumping. The Russian Zhalao Duxin also joined the trial. After 1.75 meters, only Kimura Kazuo and Zhalao Duxin remained. When the height was raised to 1.80 meters, Zhalao Duxin勉强jumped over. When it was raised to 1.85 meters, Zhalao failed twice. Kimura, bare chested, lightly jumped over, displaying excellent form. Since there was no one to compete with, Kimura stopped. Regarding Yoshizawa Muneo and Sumiyoshi Kosaku's discus and shot put (16 pounds), they both tried throwing them several times. At that time, because the Russian three-sport king, Mr. Afeinuo, was present and his results were far above Yoshizawa and Sumiyoshi, Yoshizawa and others, knowing that their strength was no match, stopped practicing. Iwanaga Misumi's hurdles showed great skill, his legs spread flat and brushing over the hurdles.  Yasushiba Suppressed. Finally, Wang Mingshen, a student from the third middle school, tried running 800 meters with Yasushiba Haruo. Wang's result, after recent hard training, had reached 2 minutes and 2 seconds. Yasushiba's record in the Far Eastern Games was 1 minute 59.6 seconds. However, the track was not as curved as it was that day. If Yasushiba were to exert his full strength on the First Sports Field, he would probably need more than 2 minutes and 1 second. Before the start yesterday, Yasushiba seemed to disdain competing with us.  His air of arrogance was evident in his expression. After the starting gun fired, Wang took the lead, with Yasushiba紧随following closely behind. There was little change in the first two laps. In the third lap, Yasushiba used his agility to overtake Wang, who紧随followed closely behind. In the fourth lap, the two accelerated and moved forward together as they were 100 meters from the finish line. Although Wang had overtaken a lap twenty meters from the finish line, Wang managed to reach the finish line 1/4 of a second ahead. At this time, the entire field of Chinese and Russian spectators applauded thunderously. The Japanese were quite disappointed, but Yasushiba still maintained his composure and pretended not to have tried his best. In fact, in terms of true strength, Yasushiba's wide and fast strides and calm breathing were signs of well-trained skills. He certainly did not exert himself fully in the first three laps. In the last lap, he wanted to accelerate, but it was too late, and the track was not hot enough, so Wang suppressed him. In terms of true skill, Wang is probably still逊less.  However, Wang has not been training for long. If he continues to train for four years, it is not unreasonable to hope that he will win glory for the motherland at the 10th Far Eastern Games in the Philippines. After the 800 meters, the Japanese announced that the athletes were tired and stopped practicing.  Mr. Ishihara, the chief of the Mantetsu section, gave a speech to the athletes and the Japanese spectators. Finally, he shouted "Banzai" three times, and they dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Results of Yesterday's Handball Singles Matches <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The All-Shanghai Chinese Handball Singles Competition, organized by the YMCA, held three matches yesterday. The Group B match between Hong Rulin and Yin Xingsheng was the most exciting. The scores of the two were constantly at the same level, with the distance between them very close. Before the end of the match, the outcome was almost uncertain. Yin won the first game with a score of 21 to 18, but Hong slightly gained the upper hand in the second and third games,挽回averting the crisis and finally winning with a score of 2 to 1. In Group C, Lin Lesheng failed against Luo Shunda because of insufficient endurance. In Group A, the battle between the two hardline players, Yan Zhaorong and Tan Dahua, did not materialize because Yan abandoned the match, leaving Tan with no opportunity to use his skills. Although Tan won, he felt quite bored. Referees: Sun Daosheng, Gu Yongzhao.  Yesterday's Results:  Group A: Tan Dahua defeated Yan Zhaorong (forfeit) 2-0</p>
<p>Group B: Hong Rulin defeated Yin Xingsheng 18-21, 21-11, 21-19  Group C: Luo Shunda defeated Lin Lesheng 21-12, 21-8  Today's Order:  Today, in Group A, Sun Daosheng will face Chen Hualu. Sun has deeply mastered the essence of handball and has been fighting in the arena for more than ten years. He can be called a senior in the Shanghai handball world and can still maintain his original skills to compete with the promising new players. Chen is an outstanding talent among the new players. Today's match can also be said to be a battle between the old and the new. In Group B, Wu Weizhou will face Wei Guanghan. In Group C, Yang Chengcai will face Lu Mengsheng. Both will be competing in the arena, and the outcome is difficult to predict.</p>

<h3 id="e112">One Word: Autumn Water <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>If the law had no provisions for divorce, alimony, etc., many women would definitely think twice before experiencing the sweet kisses of men. This world could reduce a lot of tragedies.  A man usually doesn't take a woman's loud scolding to heart because he knows that when a kettle of cold water is boiled through, there won't be much loud noise.  Love is omnipotent and omni-evil, all depending on whether you have the confidence and the ability to control it.  Love cannot be separated from carnal desire; carnal desire can be separated from love and exist independently. Love without carnal desire is like a spring flower without its fragrance. Carnal desire without love is like a weed in a barren field, cut off from nourishment.  Science is omnipotent. Almost all important industrial raw materials in the world have considerable substitutes. However, scientists have never invented a substitute for women or a substitute for love.  Giving cookies and candies to your dog and giving praise and admiration to your husband may destroy their habits and chastity.  Modern men hope for "passionate" and "lively" girls, while old-fashioned men hope for "silent" and "shy" virgins. The two are fundamentally different, so there is a lack of chaste virgins in modern times.  You can't catch fish in the river without fragrant bait, and you can't buy the hearts of women without money. However, fish sometimes cast themselves into the net without effort, and modern women are much smarter, don't even think about unconditionally surrendering their hearts.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Camel Moving House: Autumn Water <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Houses are immovable property, as everyone knows. Because they are immovable, their completion is permanent. However, now there is a camel moving house, which is truly a rare thing in the world. This happened in the desert of North Africa, and overseas telegrams have spread the news, so it should not be groundless. I will write about it. North Africa has the Sahara Desert, which is known to all those who know geography. Although there are no lush forests, there are also natural landscapes. There are cities nearby that are operated by the French. Therefore, the Sahara is often visited by tourists. The pyramids and groups of camels are full of interest and cannot be compared to the noise of Europe. In order to revitalize the market and expand its influence, the French government has in recent years had a plan to build a large hostel in the Sahara, diverting water to form springs and transplanting trees to achieve a victory of man over nature. However, it is not easy to succeed in the wilderness. Government officials have repeatedly summoned famous architects to take on the task, but they all refused to accept the job, citing their inability to adapt to the climate. Ordinary divine laborers were also unwilling to work there for a long time. The French government had no choice but to choose a suitable place on the Mediterranean coast and build a very large hostel in preparation for moving it to the Sahara after it was built. At the end of last month, the project was completely completed. The French government then loaded the components of the hostel, such as doors, windows, wall panels, and all its internal equipment, onto the backs of camels and transported them to the Sahara. They also temporarily gathered a large number of craftsmen in the Sahara to reassemble them in the same way according to the order of transportation. It is said that each camel had to transport 200 pounds of goods at a time, rotating back and forth. It was completed in less than two weeks, and the new hostel in the Sahara will soon be completed. Then, travelers to the vast desert of northern Africa will no longer have to worry about food, clothing, and shelter. Isn't that fortunate?  Autumn Water Notes: The French government's project this time cost a lot of money.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Little Knowledge: Hair, Tin, Marquis <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>After furs are exposed, they must be thoroughly cooled before being put into the box, and the box lid must be closed slowly and not slammed shut. If the heat has not dissipated and cold air enters, the fur will become damp and lose hair.  Silk fabrics with linen in them are suitable for everyday wear. However, prolonged exposure to sunlight can easily cause fading, often resulting in uneven colors on the top and bottom, which is very unsightly. It is best to avoid the sun to prevent this problem.  In summer, if you put a little dried Malan vegetable (a vegetable name, mostly available in the market, dried) when cooking meat, it can be stored for a long time without spoiling.  When buying soy sauce for cooking, first put it in a pot and fry it slightly, then put it in a container to prevent white flowers from forming for a long time. However, once a hostel is established in the Sahara, various scientific methods will be used to overcome nature and turn useless land into a rich area, which is also very worthwhile. Moreover, the hostel built on the Mediterranean coast is well-equipped and built with the latest methods, so it is not difficult to transport it by camel.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Random Talks Before Dinner: Zheng Zhian <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Last night, Mr. Yu Canxia invited me to drink in his "Washing Cauldron Reading Painting" studio. Many members of the Ming Society were at the table, talking about art and laughing heartily. Yao Jinqiu, a senior from Wuxing, was in high spirits and recited his couplets for the Zeng Gong Pavilion on Mozi Lake: "The sea field changes, but the small pavilion remains. We still love and admire the virtuous minister." "The mist and waves are vast, and the famous lake has been desolate since ancient times. It's useless to worry about Mo Chou." Also, the couplet for the Misty Rain Tower: "How can the Mandarin Duck River compare to the mossy river? It's like the green waves and misty scenery of our hometown, still seeing the lofty and magnificent terraces here, far surpassing the Floating Jade Pagoda." "The South Lake is not inferior to the West Lake. If a few more green mountains and beautiful scenery are added, it will be even better. Recognizing a corner of the city wall across the shore, it vaguely resembles approaching Yongjin Gate." The construction of its organization is beyond the reach of ordinary people. He also described a poem clock couplet by a Mr. Yun Jian, embedding the four characters Zhang San Li Si: "Four walls of books, a three-foot sword; half a shoulder of luggage, a Zhang Qin." It is also very wonderful. At that time, there was a thunderstorm and the oppressive heat was relieved. After a while, the rain stopped and Mr. Gong Jianhong arrived late due to the rain. He happily took his seat. Mr. Gong's poetic talent is pure and wonderful, and he was appreciated by my commander Ye Xudong, a student of Mingjing. I most love to recite his poems: "A child recites a book under the lamp, an old wife chats idly when dreams return." and "After fishing, the boat is tied to the sparse willow bank, and the mountain watcher leans against the sunset building." He also echoed the jueju of Lao Dan's Dream Record: "Joy is met in a dream, and the dream is also joyful. It is not easy to meet joy, and it is difficult to dream joy. If you dream of joy again, don't take him as a dream." It is exquisitely beautiful and worth reading. Mr. Gong highly praised Hu Yanzhu of the same society for his autumn butterfly poems in the rhyme of Yuyang's Autumn Willow: "Where is the famous flower's north lane home? The fragrant grass and the western garden guest are gradually sparse. The frost flower's life is tears in two lines, and the dew's fate is an inch of cotton." They are all excellent sentences. After the wine, I bid farewell and hurriedly recorded that Mr. Yu has a three-generation poetry manuscript. Mr. Canxia's father, Mr. Ping Han, has a legacy of Su Chi Collection, so he combined the Canxia Collection and his son Yuan Ying's Cocoon Collection and published them. I once sent his edition to Mr. Chen Shiyi of Houguan to ask for his evaluation. Houguan replied that he regretted not being able to include it in the Modern Poetry Anthology and Shiyi Studio Poetry Talks, so I also recorded this to show a glimpse of literary correspondence. (Thank You)</p>

<p>Mrs. Su, a Hui Muslim woman in Zhangjiachong outside the East Gate of Shaoyang, likes to eat salted rice. She always adds a large amount of salt to her tea and wine. When asked why, she said it was because they were bland.  Also, Luo, a wealthy man in the west of the same county, likes to eat rotten food. He lets the meat breed maggots, the fruit ferment, and the tofu grow mold before eating it. He has never been sick in his life and is as healthy as a normal person.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Travels in Southeast Asia (41) <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>On the ninth day, a large Buddha was newly erected outside the door, about six丈 tall, which was raised by Siamese monks. It is guarded and built by Hu Wenhu, who said it was built according to his mother's last wish. The Buddhist yellow-robed Siamese monk knows a little English and also eats meat, but does not eat after noon. Also, Siamese monks do not take money directly, but in fact they do not directly take it with their hands, but wrap it in a towel or put it in a bag. It is ridiculous to cover your ears and steal a bell; there are so many ridiculous things in the world. The Siamese monk gave me a Siamese newspaper, but unfortunately I can't understand it. I heard that the young Siamese king, who studied in England, is reforming the country and striving for progress. He has already recovered judicial power. Its sovereignty is more independent than our sleeping lion, Great China. It is deplorable. I heard that although Siam is a pure Buddhist country, the Siamese king, as a new youth派, does not worship Buddhism very much in his heart, but he is just afraid of habit.  On the tenth day, I visited the Shuanglin Temple. This temple is not very important, but the gate is spacious and there are one or twenty monks. The temple has only been built for forty years and needs to be repaired. There is a releasing pond outside the door, and the flowers and trees are beautiful. When Master Taixu came here, he recuperated here and almost couldn't get up. He was saddened by Shuanglin as a Buddhist example of Nirvana. Master Taixu deeply lamented the lack of talent in the Southeast Asian Buddhist community and cried bitterly, wanting to show Nirvana. This temple, although old, is solemn. When it was first built, it was raised by a female nun surnamed Chen, who had two sons and one daughter. The family was wealthy. They shaved their heads and became monks at Yishan in Fuzhou, and donated all their family wealth to buy a wooden boat and travel overseas to India. Her mother nun led them to tour the Buddhist sites in India. The older son's name was Shanhui. He often entered定samadhi for one or twenty days without eating. His younger brother's name was Xinghui. He entered定samadhi in Ceylon Island, the first time for three years and the second time for six years. He then left定samadhi. During定samadhi, he abstained from food and drink, and his clothes were completely ruined, but he was unharmed. When he came out of定samadhi, he was no different from ordinary people. The King of Ceylon was greatly shocked and led the people of the country to worship him and invited him to travel together. The Indians thought this was a beautiful story. But although Mr. Chen remained in定samadhi for three years, he had no wisdom or other talents when he left定samadhi. The whole family accompanied the mother back east and stopped in Singapore. A wealthy merchant, Liu Jinbang, believed in him and donated more than 200,000 to build this temple. The famous gentleman Qiu Shuyuan also donated 3,000 yuan. Later, his eldest son died, so the whole family returned to China, and the second son died in Hong Kong because he couldn't stand the cold. Now there is still a stone tablet in this temple, which is an extraordinary person after being rubbed for a long time. It turns out that entering定samadhi is equal to the hibernation of animals. Frogs hibernate for decades. If people use suggestion, put down all fate, and can last for a long time. I know this kind of psychology very well. However, now that bandits are everywhere, my original wish must be to eliminate world human war before I can devote myself to leaving the mortal world. I have a general understanding of the method of cultivation and I am definitely not superstitious, but now I have no time to do it.  Lin from Yin County, Zhejiang, was my classmate and liked to sleep. He often lay on the couch after class and didn't get up all day on Sundays. All his knowledge was often researched and obtained in dreams, even during major exams. Therefore, when we stayed up all night, he said, "Why don't I stay up day and night?"  Chili peppers are liked by Hunanese and Sichuanese. I, a Hunanese, am naturally among those who like to eat them. However, I am different from others. When eating, I must add garlic and ginger, and do not cook them. The mouth is full of aroma when entering the mouth, and I don't need to eat all day. If I don't eat them, my nose runs like I have a cold, which is very strange.  Tang Bingnan, a famous gentleman from Zhaoling, likes to talk about Liao Zhai. Whether you know him or not, he must pull you to sit and listen to his endless talk day and night. Once, everyone agreed to run away during his talk, but he was still talking with relish. He often said to people, "I have no other hobbies in my life, Liao Zhai, pig liver, and good wine." Then, he not only likes to talk about Liao Zhai, but also likes pig liver and good wine.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Victory Records: Bai Mudanzi Xian <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Xue Xiaoqing Tan Ci records that Victory Records recorded last time were released yesterday. I bought the complete set, which is clear and pleasant to listen to. Last Sunday night, my friend Mr. Chen Hongru told me on the way that Victory was also recording Bai Mudan records recently. Last night, they recorded Zhang Guobin's "Red Rose", "Joining the Army", "Leaving the Kiln", "Burning Cotton Mountain", "Please Song Ling Four Jinshi", Wang Huchen's "Luanzhou", "Night Battle Machao", "Road Yao Knows Horsepower", "Head Ben Journey to the West", and "Powder Makeup Building". Tonight, they will record various operas that Bai Mudan is skilled in. I have repeatedly thought about going to listen, but I have no opportunity. Therefore, I asked Mr. Chen to accompany me. When we arrived, Bai Mudan was singing loudly, accompanied by gongs, drums, strings, and flutes. Listening to it in the quiet of the night, I was refreshed. Tonight, they recorded five "Fengyi Pavilion", "Lianxiang Biography", "Mantou Nunnery", "Playing Flower Drum", and "Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers" pieces. Bai Mudan's God-given voice is simple and powerful, and she does not like fancy tunes, which is commendable. Moreover, she is calm and unhurried on the spot and has no cramped attitude. The more she sings, the more excited she becomes. After singing, the sky turned fish-belly white, and I took my leave, but the lingering sound seemed to still linger in my ears.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: Farewell Banquet, Leaving the Party, Pinching Flowers to Leave a Beautiful Shadow, Famous Garden Gathering, Tea Tasting to See Beautiful Posture On the one hand, I posted advertisements for help with begging, and on the other hand, I posted reports similar to credit reference books thanking people for donating money. It is common to see philanthropies such as unnamed people donating 10,000 yuan and hidden people donating 5,000 taels of silver. They donated money but refused to be named. This shows that they were truly good-hearted people and not people who were buying fame and reputation. Moreover, at that time, kidnapping in Shanghai had not yet been produced. Kidnapping was produced in the dark ages of Shanghai in recent years, so they were definitely not afraid of kidnapping. It is probably the old saying "people are afraid of being famous and pigs are afraid of being strong" that has become a motto in the past. It is difficult to open the door to kindness. The people who do good deeds also know that this is a difficult thing, because when you, the great philanthropist, become famous, people will have to ask you for an example. The Chinese people value an example the most, and they still cannot get rid of it to this day. If you respond to one aspect, you cannot respond to the other aspect, and people will cite this example to embarrass you. Therefore, writing things like "unnamed" and "hidden" is somewhat of a way to hide. There is a name inside the unnamed. At this time, a group of great philanthropists went to the disaster area to provide relief and also contacted and corresponded with a group of great philanthropists in Shanghai at any time. Shanghai is a place where the wine industry is concentrated and the source of all wealth. As long as the gentry and merchants in Shanghai can help, things will be much easier. Secondly, the managers of several newspapers also need to contact them. First, they can publish free advertisements. A piece of paper will spread to both the commercial port and the inland, and everyone will know the extent of the disaster area and the number of victims, which can make compassionate people quickly donate money to help. Second, for the sake of convenience, the newspaper can be entrusted to collect disaster relief funds. The money sent to the newspaper today will be published in the newspaper tomorrow. How quick and straightforward is this? If a certain amount is collected, the newspaper will be entrusted to remit it. The remaining odd amounts will still be stored there and remitted to the disaster area after a certain amount has been accumulated. However, disaster relief is always very urgent and often a drop in the bucket or water far from the fire and too slow to help. At that time, it all depends on a few enthusiastic and powerful people who first墊borrow the money and then return it later. Although collecting small donations of ten or five yuan can also accumulate a lot, by the time these disaster victims want to索be dry fish in the market, they will無be of no help. Therefore, there are all kinds of new methods. Some people advocate performing to help with disaster relief and teach many famous actors in Shanghai to sing for a day. If the gentry and merchants in Shanghai come out to promote it, the actors will not be enthusiastic. However, that trick has been played several times, and there is not much left after a day's expenses. There is also no point in doing this often, so you want to create some new tricks to stir up the moment and raise tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Gold Speculation Rises Again Above 600 Taels Mark: A Great Surge of Fluctuations. Yesterday (July 3rd), the Gold Exchange resumed trading as usual, and the speculation in gold rose even more, already exceeding the 600 taels mark. However, the market conditions were chaotic and unstable, with fluctuations of up to 10 taels in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The turbulent market seemed confusing. Foreign exchange rates were narrowed by two notches, and the internal market was also tight. Trading volume remained high among various firms, but their buying and selling differed, and their movements were quite sensitive. For example, Yuan Yu Yong, Yong Cheng Chang, Tian Yu Yong, and Shun Li all sold off, while Zhi Feng Yong Yuan Sheng, Sen Chang Yong, and Jin Da Yong mostly bought in. The market saw a surge from the early session, mainly because large silver bars kept falling, and a certain Chinese bank temporarily suspended operations to prevent further exchange rate shrinkage, causing high anxiety. The price soared to 606 taels before stabilizing. After that, it fluctuated sharply. By noon, sellers became active, and the foreign exchange market contracted, showing weakness and a sharp drop of 10 taels, breaking the 600 taels mark. In the afternoon, Fu Chang, Yuan Kang Xiang, and Zhi Feng Yong bought in, while Yuan Cheng Yong Yi Feng Yong, and Yu Da sold off. Initially, it was stable, but later it turned from weak to strong, with an underlying tension, resulting in a difference of 10 taels. Afterward, it stood at around 602 taels. The morning session opened with a jump of 9 mace and 6 candareens. Yesterday, large silver bars fell again by one-eighth, and the silver price shrank by one-quarter. The exchange rate did not change. The opening price of gold for August immediately rose by 9 mace and 6 candareens, totaling 600 taels and 8 candareens. The gross price rose from 598 taels to 606 taels. Buyers were active, and the foreign exchange rate was also strong. Recently, the Japanese-funded bank absorbed 1 tael, 3 mace, 5 candareens and a half. September British gold was settled at 6 pence. However, when the announcement of the shilling rate was made, it returned to 600 taels and 4 to 5 candareens, as many sellers appeared. Subsequently, it was learned that the shilling rate was narrowed by half a penny, and the US dollar Japanese gold added 3 mace and 5 candareens, immediately rising to 4 taels and 9.3 candareens, reaching 604 and a half taels. The domestic market was also firm. Banks traded 6 pence of September British gold. Mitsui absorbed 1 tael, 3 mace, 5 candareens and 5 fen in Dalian. Afterward, there were about 4 or 5 taels of twists and turns. After 10:30, the trend softened, and most bulls sold off. The exchange market was no longer tight, but there were few transactions. After 11:00, it broke the 600 taels mark, suddenly plummeting by 7 or 8 taels, with a great crash. By 11:30, it dropped to 96 taels. After entering the market, it seemed to rise slightly, reaching 98 taels and 8 candareens at noon. When the market closed at noon, it was 98 taels and 2 candareens, and then it rose again by 1 tael. The listed price was changed to 663 taels. The Japanese-funded bank initially pressed down slightly by 62 or 63 taels, and later by around 60 taels. At noon, it suppressed slightly by 64 or 65 taels. The evening closing price showed an increase of 10 taels and 7 candareens. The market opened immediately and increased to 600 taels, which was the remaining momentum after the noon closing. Next, it was 600 taels and 9 candareens. Major firms such as Yuan Cheng Yong sold off, and the exchange rate also eased. September British gold was traded in and out at 6 pence and 1875. Mitsubishi and Zhengjin also traded 36 yuan and 8215 for September US dollars. Therefore, it fell by 6 or 7 taels at around 3:00, suddenly reaching 594 and a half taels, and then gradually rose upwards. Heng Xing and others chased after the near-term British gold, which was traded at 6 pence by An Da Da Ying. Market confidence improved, and it jumped 10 taels, with a surge of wind and clouds, rising step by step. At 4:00, it reached 604 and a half taels. However, some people on the trading floor took this opportunity to sell off, with losses of 2 or 3 taels, 1 tael and 6 or 7 candareens, and 2 taels and 5 or 6 candareens. At 4:30, the market closed at 601 taels and 9 candareens, continuing the surge of 10 taels and 7 candareens compared to June 30th (Monday). The highest price was 606 taels, and the lowest price was 594 taels and 5 candareens, a difference of 11 taels and 5 candareens. The morning opening price for goods was 600 taels and 3 candareens, the noon closing price was 99 taels, the afternoon closing price was 9 taels and 8 candareens, the listed price was still suppressed by 61 or 62 taels, the recorded price was 96 taels to 98 taels, and the water replenishment was 96 taels to 600 taels. The Dalian group had more sales than purchases. Trading firms included Fu Chang, Yuan Cheng Yong, Heng Xing, Wan Xing, Yuan Mao Yong, etc., who bought and sold intermittently. Yuan Cheng, Tai Kang Run, Sen Chang Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Chun Yuan Yong, and Xiang Yu all bought in. Shun Li Tian Yu Yong, Da De Cheng, Yuan Yu Yong, Cheng Feng Yong, Yong Cheng Chang, and Yu Da all sold off. In the afternoon, Zhi Feng Yong Fu Chang and Fu Yu bought in, while Yuan Cheng Yong, Yu Da, Yi Feng Yong, and Tai Feng Cheng sold off. Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Tai Heng, Yuan Tai, Heng Xing, Da De Cheng, Shun Li, and Wan Xing had erratic trading patterns. The Dalian group sold off a total of 1,400 to 1,500 lots, while buying in 850 lots. Trading in the Guangdong group was divergent, with occasional buying and selling, but no large numbers.</p>

As for the domestic market, it was tight from the early session, then leveled off, and then strengthened in the afternoon, due to the large fluctuations in gold speculation, with twists and turns of more than 10 taels. Only the rising trend was sharp, already exceeding the 600 taels mark. Therefore, the afternoon currency closing was tighter compared to the end of June (Monday). The shilling rate was reduced by three one-two-five, the US dollar reduced by six eight-seven-five, and the Japanese gold added two and a half cents. The market was tight both officially and unofficially. Chinese merchants' transactions were not active, because the gold market was too turbulent and they dared not get involved. British gold transactions amounted to over one hundred thousand pounds. A small number of Chinese merchants bought and sold through banks, such as HSBC absorbing and Sumitomo selling. Various banks also traded with each other for fifty to sixty thousand pounds, and also traded two hundred thousand US dollars. Sumitomo sold a little, and gold companies slightly bought in and then sold tens of thousands of Japanese gold recently. Mitsui and Joseon absorbed, market confidence was firm, and the market atmosphere was strong. The domestic British exchange rate fluctuated only by one-two-five.

<p>Market Overview: In recent days, banks were closed for two days due to the year-end accounting, and operations resumed yesterday. The complexity of the settlement procedures is self-evident. The trading situation was generally mediocre due to the summer season. There were no major fluctuations in the market lending rates.

Lending Rates: (Foreign Lending) The morning lending rate was 7 candareens, 2 fen, 3 li and a half, and the afternoon rate was 6 hao, 2 hu and a half. The result was a weak form, with a decrease of 8 hao and 7 hu compared to the previous afternoon. (Silver Lending) The morning rate was 4 fen per yuan, and the afternoon rate was the same due to scarce transactions. Banks quoted 6 fen, adding water for a profit of 8 or 9 fen, with a moderate balance between tightness and looseness. Auxiliary Currency Market: The morning and afternoon rates for Jiangnan small silver dollars were both 6 qian, 2 fen and 8 li, a sharp drop of 3 li compared to the previous day's afternoon rate, with very few transactions, only 2,000 jiao in the morning.

<h3 id="e124">June Deposit Interest at 5.5 Taels <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>In addition to discussing other important matters, the Standing Committee of the Money Industry Association also voted on the deposit interest proposal for June. Due to the excessive silver lending rate and the large base rate, the deposit interest rate was set at 5.5 taels with a 95% discount, and the overdue interest rate was also increased according to the 5.5 taels base rate. Thus, the highest overdue interest rate was 11.5 taels, which was 1 or 2 taels higher than the previous month.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Securities, Customs Tariffs, and Troop Reduction Surge Significantly <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Nineteen-Year Cigarette and Customs Duty Spot Auction. Yesterday, trial auctions were held for nineteen-year cigarette and nineteen-year customs duty spot transactions on the Securities Exchange. Since the issuance was recent and circulation in the market was scarce, it was difficult to have large-scale inflows and outflows for the time being. Aside from the troop reduction spot amounting to 18,000 yuan, the other bond markets were extremely quiet. The futures market was quite sluggish, with a total turnover of 7.8 million yuan for both the morning and afternoon markets. The bond market environment was slightly better, with improved market sentiment. There were not many sellers, and buying interest was quite active. Prices rose slightly in the early morning, and later customs tariffs, troop reduction, rehabilitation, etc. all traded briskly. As a result, customs tariffs and troop reduction, etc. each rose by about 1.5 yuan compared to Monday. Although other bonds also firmed slightly, the amount was very small. Bond type, period, spot, opening, closing, change from previous day, transaction volume (yuan): 6-7 month 63.70 64.15 up 0.55 1,900,000 6-8 month 64.20 64.05 up 0.35 1,350,000 7-year spot 78.00 up 1.00 100,000 7-year August 77. 0 77.00 up 0.20 2,000,000 Extended 7 month 74.60 74.80 up 0.20 1,500,000 Rehabilitation spot 83.00 down 0.60 200,000 Rehabilitation 7 month 83.80 84.40 up 1.15 4,650,000 Rehabilitation 8 month 84.30 84.80 up 1.05 2,650,000 Extended cigarette 7 month 61.20 61.30 up 0.10 1,250,000 Customs duty 7 month 57.50 58.30 up 1.50 13,000,000 Customs duty 8 month 56.00 57.15 up 1.50 1,040,000 Troop reduction spot 49.70 up 1.34 18,000 Troop reduction small spot 45.50 47.80 up 2.40 Troop reduction 7 month 48.50 49.60 up 1.45 1,645,000 Troop reduction 8 month 49.00 49.30 up 1.55 910,000 Demobilization spot 58.00 58.60 down 1.30 4,000 Demobilization 7 month 56.50 55.95 up 0.05 905,000 Demobilization 8 month 53.50 52.75 up 0.25 585,000 Financial spot 31.50 down 1.60 1,000 Financial 7 month 32.00 up 0.50 1,500 96 7 month 14.30 14.30 up 0.30 400,000 96 8 month 14.50 Opened initially 100,000 Customs duty spot 72.00 Opened initially 1,000 Cigarette spot 72.00 Opened initially 1,000</p>
<h3 id="e126">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Sales Gradually Improve <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Overseas cotton yarn remains sluggish, and third-grade yarn has fallen by another two or three yuan. However, the Shanghai yarn market alone has seen an increase, mainly because current sales are more active and dealers from Sichuan and Guangdong are more interested. Futures trading in Sichuan is also healthy, so market confidence is firm and the market is trending higher. Bulls generally expect current yarn sales to continue, and autumn sales are approaching. Those doing more business in July and August yarn are therefore more numerous. However, according to investigation reports, the bottom goods stockpiled by factories in Shanghai and other ports amount to approximately 120,000 to 130,000 bales, so sellers remain pessimistic. The intraday bidding was driven higher by actual sales. In the previous market, intraday bidding for near-month contracts tended to fall lower than far-month contracts by two or three points. Those who covered short positions were more numerous. As a result, each month rose or fell by one cent. In the afternoon, it was heard that current yarn transactions were smooth in Sichuan and Guangdong, and buying interest was tightening. Each rose further by six, seven, or eight cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 9,850 bales. Sellers included Hengyi, Xincheng, Shenxin, Tianlong, Dafeng, and Maoji, selling between 450 and 1,100 bales. Buyers included Lichang, Taichang, Dafu, Yuda, and Taixing, buying between 250 and 1,300 bales. The closing prices for intraday bidding are recorded below. Intraday Bidding Prices, Rise/Fall, Open Account Balance (Bales): October 1557 up 6 28307 July 1552 up 9 19950 November 1558 72635 August 1551 up 6 28100 December 1558 82150 September 1553 up 5 26700</p>
<p>Current yarn: Sichuan and Guangdong dealers show strong interest. Yesterday, each dealer bought 2,830 bales of current and futures yarn. Domestic traders bought 205 bales. Market conditions were slightly firm. Among the dealers, Sichuan dealers bought the most, at 1,300 bales. In addition, Guangdong dealers bought 735 bales, Xiamen dealers bought 65 bales, Tianjin dealers bought 70 bales, Hankou dealers bought 210 bales, Changsha dealers bought 200 bales, Yunnan dealers bought 100 bales, and miscellaneous dealers bought 150 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Cotton Market Suddenly Reacts <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Standard Rebounds Four Candareens. The decline in US cotton prices has been checked, and market confidence in Shanghai is relatively firm. The steady decline in prices in recent days has led to profit-taking and short covering, causing a sudden reaction. Market conditions are tight, but actual sales have not yet developed. However, the world cotton market is still in decline, and the future is not optimistic. Japanese Bidding Covers Short Positions: The morning session of Japanese bidding opened with tight market conditions due to a lack of sellers. Japanese merchants covered their short positions, and each rose by two candareens. In the afternoon, with the good yarn market, Japanese Dongmian covered their short positions, and each month rose by another one to two and a half candareens. The total transaction volume for the day was 40,800 dan. Buyers included Taixing, Dafeng, Hengde, Changfeng, Lichang, Jifeng, Gengfeng, Shen Yuyi Chang, and Jinfeng, buying between 800 and 2,000 dan. Sellers included Shenxin, Gongtai, Yongfeng, Xincheng, Yuanda, and Tianchang, selling between 1,000 and 2,500 dan. The closing prices for Japanese bidding are listed below. Japanese Bidding Closing Prices, Rise/Fall, Open Account Balance (Dan): October 3525 up 4 589800 July 35.45 up 3 061600 November 35.15 4075300 August 35.85 4088900 December 35.00 3512500 Spot Sales Stalled: There was no activity in spot cotton sales. The various factories took no action. The source was about 100+ bales of Tonghua.</p>

<p>US Cotton Traders Watch: Yesterday, the US cotton market was lackluster, and traders watched. Futures prices rose or fell by two to three points. Spot prices fell by five points. British cotton futures rose by one or two points. Spot prices rose by seven points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by ten points. Indian cotton closed very early, and market conditions were firm.

<h3 id="e129">Private Estimates of US Cotton <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>On the 2nd, the New York Computer Shield Company estimated that this year's new cotton production would be 70.5% of the normal annual output. The previous estimate (May 29th) was 69.7% of the normal annual output.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Food: White Yuan Downstream, Indica Rice Stable <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Northern Rice Still Suspended. Yesterday, no boats from the river arrived in Zhabei. The total stock of each type of goods was over ten numbers. The northern rice was still suspended because most stores had not yet received their goods. Although the evaluation bureau repeatedly urged them, it was still ineffective. Only a few stores slightly took delivery. Therefore, the river price still tended to be suspended. Only those at the bottom of the boats that had not yet completed the sale slightly settled. Factory machine tops stabilized due to tight supply of foreign rice. The top goods also required 21 yuan. Buying interest in white yuan was also weak, and sales were sluggish. Prices fell by one or two jiao. High-quality goods were only around 19 yuan. In the Shanghai South, only about two or three numbers of goods from the southern gang arrived from the river. No goods arrived from the southwest road. Street trading was still good. Medium and low-grade machine rice opened at 21 yuan because, in recent times, there has been no distinction between Changxi, Suzhou, and Tongzhou. Small quantities of sailing boats were seen arriving, so there was no accurate price. Only the Yangdu top trading was slightly strong because foreign rice rose sharply by one or two jiao. Therefore, it also tended to be firm. The top Yang tips were 21 yuan. Based on this price, there was still the possibility of being cost-effective compared to the domestic price. The altered yuan had varied destinations. Fortunately, the existing stock was dry and was sold as soon as it arrived. The market was slightly more active than the Zhabei side because there was no existing stock. The top altered yuan also required 19 yuan. There was no trading of the altered and humidified. The market price standard was 18 yuan and 0 li.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Forward Flour Rises Even More Sharply <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw improved foreign wheat quotations of 2, 3, 6, and 7 jiao. The factories, due to wheat conditions, were unwilling to sell in large quantities. The reason they were still able to remain calm was that northern sales were only sporadic and there were no large-scale sales. Market sentiment was still stable. If sales became strong, then the market would be difficult to guarantee not to repeat the sudden surges of previous months because, compared to previous years, the new goods offered by the factories and the stockpiles of wheat were less than three or four tenths of what they used to be. In the near term, the inland gangs were not moving, and the factories' sentiment towards forward trades was unusually firm. Therefore, the rise was quite sharp. The result was that the current month was 5 li better than the previous day, August was 7.5 li better, September was 1.5 fen better, October was 1.25 fen better, and November-December were 1.75 fen better.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was generally flat and hovering. Although foreign wheat quotations were good, the factories' intentions were reportedly consistent: to stop trading, or to actually deliver the goods when absolutely necessary, in order to avoid excessive price increases. Therefore, each month saw hovering. The result was that the current month opened better by 3 fen, but then fell back, similar to the previous day. August was better by 1 fen, and September to December were each down slightly by 1 fen. The attitudes of the various factories towards spot wheat were cautious. Generally, they had to reduce the price a little to attract large-scale demand. However, because inland prices were high and rice prices were not cheap, each dealer raised their prices by 2 or 3 fen. 6,700+ packages of wheat were opened from Tongzhou, Guandian, Qingjiangpu, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Huangqiao, Chongming, Mingguang, etc.. 43 packages of old wheat from various routes were still opening at 5 taels and 1 qian 5 fen.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Ministry of Finance Actively Promoting the Abolition of Likin <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Likin Abolition Committee is responsible for preparing the implementation in various provinces. Before the implementation in various provinces, new legitimate taxes will be established. Since the Ministry of Finance of the National Government appointed Mr. Li Jihong, a counselor of the Ministry, to Shanghai to set up an office for the Likin Abolition Committee, he has been making every effort to contact the personnel in charge of likin in various provinces to carry out the abolition of likin. Yesterday, a reporter from the Zhendan News Agency visited an important official at the office to inquire about the recent progress of the committee. The details are as follows: Since the establishment of the Likin Abolition Committee in various provinces, telegrams have been sent to the finance departments of various provinces to send personnel in charge to Shanghai for consultation with the committee. The main objectives are twofold: (A) to hold the personnel in charge in various provinces responsible for the implementation of the abolition of likin; (B) to instruct the committee to provide guidance and find solutions when provinces encounter special difficulties. Currently, personnel in charge from Liaoning, Hubei, Hunan, Shandong, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and four provinces of Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Fujian have reported. The committee has contacted the provinces through official documents. Except for Jiangxi and Jiangsu provinces, where likin is directly managed by the central government, the remaining provinces share the same difficulty in finding methods to compensate for the abolition of likin. Therefore, the representatives of the provinces have held one meeting, but there have been no other formal meetings. Ministry of Finance Survey: In order to investigate the likin situation in various provinces and methods of compensation, the Ministry of Finance has formulated a projection table and distributed it to various provinces to fill out and submit to the committee. The content of the table includes: (1) the total amount of likin abolished nationwide; (2) the special taxes to be levied in accordance with the situation in each province; (3) the estimated revenue of special taxes; (4) the types of important products in each province. Implementation Time: It is heard that the implementation of likin abolition will take place on the Double Tenth Festival, and the committee is supervising the preparation for implementation in various provinces. Furthermore, it is imperative that new compensatory taxes be completed by the Double Tenth Festival. It is heard that the resolution of the Likin Abolition Committee is being handled, and it is specially recorded as follows: Likin Abolition Plan: Outline for Abolishing Domestic Transit Taxes, Reforming Special Consumption Taxes. Based on the resolutions of the National Financial Conference and the Likin Abolition Circular, the Ministry of Finance abolishes all domestic likin and similar transit taxes nationwide, and simultaneously implements special consumption taxes as compensation, and formulates the following implementation outline: (A) Steps to Abolish Domestic Transit Taxes: First, the following items shall be abolished by the provinces on a scheduled basis. By the end of September, bureaus and cards shall be abolished or merged separately. By the end of November at the latest, all types of bureaus and cards shall be abolished: (1) Likin; (2) various commodity taxes reformed from likin; (3) various inland taxes and levies containing the nature of transit taxes; (4) Landed tax. Second, the following items shall be abolished by the Ministry of Finance on a scheduled basis: items 1, 2, and 3 shall be abolished by the end of November; items 4, 5, 6, and 7 shall be abolished by the end of December: (1) Railway freight tax; (2) Parcel post likin; (3) Customs stations and surtaxes 50 miles outside the commercial ports; (4) Import duties and surtaxes of the Maritime and Land New Customs; (5) Re-import duties and surtaxes of the Maritime and Land New Customs; (6) Duties and surtaxes of the Maritime and Land New Customs from this port to that port; (7) Customs duties and surtaxes within 50 miles of the commercial ports. Customs stations on land borders and coastal customs collecting national border import and export taxes are not subject to abolition. (B) Principles for Reforming Special Consumption Taxes: First, for domestic goods: (1) The tax amount of special consumption taxes reformed by abolishing likin shall not be higher than the original tax amount, but luxury goods are not subject to this restriction; (2) When reforming special consumption taxes, efforts shall be made to avoid setting up checkpoints at every stage, and there shall be no repeated levies or obstructions; (3) The fiscal authorities must first consult the opinions of commercial groups on the collection methods of special consumption taxes; (4) In the event of items that must be encouraged or protected, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce shall jointly formulate encouragement or protection measures with representatives of commercial groups; (5) Daily necessities for people's livelihood, such as rice, wheat, native cloth, firewood, and charcoal, must be tax-free; (6) Fertilizers used in agriculture must be tax-free; (7) Various machines used in agriculture must be tax-free; (8) The items listed in this outline for taxation and manufactured goods must be tax-free; (9) Educational supplies and items that promote culture must be tax-free; (10) Small-scale items with small production must be tax-free. Second, for foreign goods: (1) Before tariff autonomy, in the event of items that are the same as domestically taxed goods, consumption taxes shall still be levied in addition to the import duties of the Maritime and Land New Customs, in accordance with Japanese precedents; (2) After tariff autonomy, the system of one tax per item shall be followed, and no further taxes shall be levied after one tax is paid, or the previous method shall still be followed, as determined at the time. (C) Types of Special Consumption Taxes Reformed: First, the Ministry of Finance shall levy three types of consumption taxes: (1) Grain tax; (2) Textile tax; (3) Factory tax. The flour tax will be levied first, followed by the silk, ramie, and cotton yarn taxes. When the above three types are levied, the Ministry of Finance shall notify the Ministry of Finance to negotiate and divide the collection. The original taxes collected by the Ministry of Finance within the scope of likin shall be verified and the Ministry of Finance shall propose one of the three types in accordance with the amount. Before the Ministry of Finance levies the tax, it may entrust the provincial finance department to collect it on its behalf. For those who have already paid the factory tax on silk, ramie, and cotton yarn, the tax bill may be used to offset the textile tax when it is paid. Second, the Ministry of Finance shall temporarily entrust the provincial finance departments to levy several types of special consumption taxes from the following: (1) Oils; (2) Teas; (3) Paper; (4) Tin foil; (5) Seafood; (6) Wood; (7) Ceramics; (8) Livestock (excluding livestock used for farming and domestic animals); (9) Medicinal materials; (10) Lacquer; (11) Bulk mineral products (only leather, fur, and feathers); (12) Bulk mineral products (tax shall only be levied on mines); (13) Cocoons (cocoon tax shall be refunded when silk tax is collected); (14) Silk (silk tax shall be refunded when silk fabric tax is collected); (15) Soybeans (soybean tax shall be refunded when oil tax is collected); (16) Cotton (cotton tax shall be refunded when yarn tax is collected). The amount of consumption tax to be levied on the above items shall be selected and reported to the Ministry for approval by the provincial finance departments in accordance with local conditions. The principle is as follows: (1) Tax shall only be levied on the place of origin for the above items, and after one tax is paid, it shall be valid throughout the country, and no other levies shall be collected; (2) Tax shall not be levied on items that are not produced in bulk within the province; (3) The provincial finance departments shall be responsible for the special consumption taxes levied by the provinces, and bureaus shall be set up to handle goods of the same nature jointly in order to save expenses.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Ministry Approval Requested for Abolition of Parcel Post Tax <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>An example of abolition had been previously discussed. The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for the prompt abolition of the parcel post tax, which is similar to likin, burdens merchants and hinders postal services. The union received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that the abolition of the parcel post tax had been discussed earlier and ordered that it be abolished within the specified time.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Petition for Exemption from Tax on Writing Brushes and Ink <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Writing Brush and Ink Trade Association submitted a document to the Chamber of Commerce, stating that ink is an educational supply and should be exempted from tax in accordance with the example of books, in order to promote education and alleviate the difficulties of Jiangsu merchants, requesting that it be forwarded to the government. An investigation reveals that writing brushes and ink are educational supplies and are a national treasure of thousands of years. Historical records show that they were highly regarded. In the past, goods were transported without tax in every dynasty. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods of the Qing Dynasty, candidates only needed to mark the location of the examination hall or the provincial examination when rushing to take the examination. Upon passing through checkpoints, they were immediately verified and released without any obstruction or demands for payment. After the abolition of the imperial examination system, European customs gradually spread to the East, and talents in the country eagerly sought Western learning. As a result, high-quality writing brushes and ink were not sold well, and only medium and low-quality goods were sold. The business position of those in the industry has also changed as a result. The focus of the industry has shifted to coastal commercial ports. Goods must pass through customs, and the customs officials are mostly Westerners who are unfamiliar with Chinese history. They temporarily estimate the value of writing brushes and ink for taxation. At that time, writing brush and ink merchants lacked unity and a joint voice. The practice has continued for more than 20 years, and the accumulated habits have become increasingly serious. Whether it is customs, likin stations, or postal parcels, taxes are levied in all cases. In addition, the cost of living is rising and wages are increasing, which has endlessly increased costs. If merchants want to transport goods, their capital is not guaranteed. If they want to close their businesses, their families will starve. The national treasure of China has declined to such an extent, and who knows that the shops are filled with various steel pens, pencils, fountain pens, Japanese writing brushes, ink, and natural ink? Foreign imports are flourishing. An investigation reveals that the raw materials for writing brushes and ink, such as goat hair and brush tubes, come from Zhejiang, weasel and rabbit skins come from the Northwest, and Guang glue and borneol come from Guangdong. Ink soot and musk come from Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan. Twenty years ago, Huizhou merchants set up soot houses in the mountains of those provinces to buy tung oil for lighting and collecting soot, as well as musk and rabbit hair. Later, American merchants monopolized the lighting and soot production, and the capital was not guaranteed. They had to switch to imported Western soot. They paid consolidated taxes and likin in the interior, and import and export taxes at customs. The repeated levies exceeded 20%. An investigation reveals that the manufacturing process relies entirely on manual labor. Taking Shanghai as an example, even in this time of decline, there are still more than 3,000 workers. Wages have increased by 50% since 1927, and other benefits have also increased accordingly, but the selling price is not as good as before. Huizhou ink is sold for only 44 taels of silver per 100 catties, which is about 40% less than 10 years ago. Writing brushes have also been affected and are sold in the 21 provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Guizhou, Yunnan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and overseas, with annual sales of about 300,000 yuan. The overseas sales are to Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Saigon, the South Seas Islands, San Francisco, and other places, with annual sales of about 50,000 yuan. The annual sales of the Shanghai stores are about 150,000 yuan. The total annual sales of Shanghai are about 500,000 yuan. In addition to sea transportation, most of the goods are transported by postal parcels. The estimated cost of ink is 80 taels of silver per 100 catties, and the Huizhou tax is 4 taels. The tax rate is 1/11 of the selling price. The estimated cost of each 100 writing brushes is 2-3 yuan in foreign currency, but now that foreign currency has been converted to silver, the estimated cost is 5-6 taels of silver, which is even higher than 1/11 of the wholesale price. Furthermore, the raw materials for writing brushes and ink have already been subject to repeated taxation and likin at customs and checkpoints. Moreover, the manufactured educational supplies, writing brushes and ink, are used to promote learning for students, yet they are subject to a tax rate of 1/11. This is rare in civilized countries. The writing brush and ink merchants are suffering and will inevitably go bankrupt. As a result, the youth of the country will lose their means of learning. Thinking of this, we cannot help but hate the writing brush and ink merchants of the past who did not seek self-improvement, which has misled those in power who have no way to provide benefits to the people. If we do not express our feelings and appeal to the country to exempt taxes and promote the national treasure, ink will cease to exist in the world. Now that the National Government is under political tutelage, the central committee members and ministers are all concerned about the people and are willing to listen to their needs. Therefore, we request that the council exert its efforts to assist in forwarding this request to the National Government, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Ministry of Finance to approve the exemption of taxes on writing brushes and ink in accordance with the example of educational supplies, in order to promote education, reduce the burden of education, save the merchants who are on the verge of collapse, consolidate the foundation of the country, and preserve the national treasure. This is truly in the public interest. This is addressed to the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce. The City Chamber of Commerce forwarded a document to the central government, stating that writing brushes and ink are related to educational supplies and requesting that they be exempted from tax in accordance with the example of books, in order to promote education. The situation is hereby forwarded for review and compliance. According to a letter from the Shanghai Writing Brush and Ink Trade Association dated the 10th of this month, "An investigation reveals that writing brushes and ink are educational supplies," and so on, regarding the preservation of national treasures, etc., the association investigated the raw materials for writing brushes and ink coming from distant provinces and foreign countries. They pay likin and consolidated taxes in the interior, and import and export taxes at customs. It is said that the total amount of taxes exceeds 20%. After the writing brushes and ink are manufactured, the customs tax paid for transporting them out of Shanghai is said to be more than 20% of the estimated value. Moreover, since 1927, labor costs have doubled, resulting in heavy capital and sluggish sales. It is estimated that the total sales at home and abroad are only about 500,000 yuan. The commercial situation is obviously difficult. It is believed that writing brushes and ink, in addition to being needed by public and private institutions and shops, are also sold to schools, which are ultimately educational supplies. The association stated that this tax revenue, calculated at 10% of the total annual sales, would amount to about 50,000 yuan, which is equivalent to only about 30,000 taels of customs silver. The total customs revenue of the Jianghai Customs is more than 20 million taels per year. This amount is only a drop in the bucket. In order to benefit students and alleviate the difficulties of merchants, the association requests that it be exempted from customs duties in accordance with the example of books. It seems that there is no obstacle to public expenditure. The situation is hereby forwarded to your government departments for review and approval, and that the order be forwarded for implementation. This is truly in the public interest. In addition to submitting this to the National Government, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, this is respectfully submitted to the National Government, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. On the 28th of this month, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued a reply stating that it had received the submission and had consulted the Ministry of Finance for review and handling. You are hereby notified accordingly.</p>

<p>No report of recent whereabouts. There were rumors that Mr. Bell, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner, had taken a ship to Shanghai. Yesterday, according to news from the Shanghai General Customs Office, it was said that the news of Mr. Bell's arrival in Shanghai was only seen in the newspapers, and he had not reported his arrival by telegram. As of yesterday, Mr. Bell had not arrived in Shanghai. It was also said that it was not true that he had gone to Beidaihe for summer vacation.

<p>The printing of superstitious matters in almanacs has always been prohibited. However, the almanacs for 1920 had already been compiled and printed by various bookstores, and the central government temporarily allowed them to remain in circulation out of consideration. Now that the almanacs for 1931 are being compiled, they should be strictly banned in order to promote good customs. Yesterday, the Bureau of Social Affairs specially instructed various book trade associations, stating that the theories of auspicious and inauspicious days, yin and yang, and the five elements are sufficient to promote superstition and obscure the people's wisdom. They must not be printed in the almanacs or calendars for 1931. Those who violate this order will be subject to confiscation and destruction, as well as penalties, as a warning to those who do not comply with the advice. The associations are hereby ordered to notify their members to comply. Furthermore, the Bureau's compilation of the almanacs for 1931 is nearing completion.

<p>The National Federation of Commerce received an order No. 11202 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday, stating that the Federation had previously reported that the first general meeting of members would be convened on July 1, which had been approved and filed. Now, it is reported that the military affairs in various provinces have not been settled and transportation is blocked, and few members have reported. Upon verification, the situation is still true. The request to postpone the meeting for three months until October 1 should be approved. You are hereby notified. French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Progress on Abolishing the 2% Surtax <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association convened an emergency meeting the day before yesterday to discuss ways to abolish the 2% surtax levied by the French Concession Municipal Council. The details of the meeting were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, the association cited the notice published by the French Concession Municipal Council on July 23, 1927, stating that "In order to avoid misunderstandings, the Municipal Council will levy a temporary special surtax of 2% in addition to the 12% property tax from July 1, 1927. The tax receipt will be printed with the words 'This receipt is for the collection of 12% property tax plus 2% temporary special surtax.' If the living standards and economic conditions gradually improve around January 1928, the Municipal Council may reconsider the property tax issue at that time," thereby confirming that the Municipal Council had already recognized that the 2% surtax was a temporary special surtax for six months and stated that the Municipal Council may reconsider the property tax issue around January 1928. However, the association found that the income of the French Municipal Council has increased year by year, and the income from property taxes alone has increased even more due to the increase in new construction and the imposition of additional charges based on the assessed value of the property. The abundance of its economic situation can be seen. Therefore, the association believes that the French Concession authorities have not considered the above notice for three years, which is regrettable. Furthermore, the Public Concession and the French Concession simultaneously increased the property tax by 2%. Now, the Public Concession has abolished the surtax, while the French Municipal Council has made no indication, which is even more unfair. In addition, the citizens are constantly questioning the association, making active negotiations imperative. It is also heard that a majority of citizens advocate that if the case cannot be resolved satisfactorily immediately, they should petition the new French Minister during the celebration of the French National Day.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Tian Tong Passed Away in Shanghai <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Tian Tong, courtesy name Ziqin, was from Qichun, Hubei. He passed away at 1:00 PM on the 2nd of this month at the Shanghai Sino-Western Sanatorium. In 1905, Mr. Tian supported Dr. Sun Yat-sen in organizing the Tongmenghui in Tokyo, Japan, advocating the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of a republic. He was elected as a member of the Council and Director of the Secretariat. After the establishment of the Republic, he was elected as a member of the House of Representatives. After the failure of the Second Revolution, he fled to Tokyo, Japan. After Yuan Shikai's death, Mr. Tian returned and continued to serve as a member of the House of Representatives. Later, when Cao Kun planned to bribe his way to the presidency, Mr. Tian strongly advocated that the members of the House of Representatives move south, and Cao Kun ultimately failed. In 1926, when the revolutionary army arrived in Wuchang, Mr. Tian was appointed as the Jianghan Pacification Commissioner. After the South was pacified, he was ordered to be an envoy to Jin to persuade Yan Xishan to send troops to support the revolution and was elected as a member of the National Government. In 1928, he was appointed as a member of the Legislative Yuan but declined the position and retired to Shanghai to enjoy writing. He ran the Taiping Magazine, but suffered from overwork and contracted abdominal pain, which lasted for several months and ultimately led to his death. His coffin has now been moved to his residence at No. 72 Yongyu Lane, Belle Road, French Concession. In recent days, many people have come to pay their respects in plain cars and white horses.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Zhuang Songfu Establishes Donggang Shipping Company <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Direct Sailings to Fenghua and Ninghai Now Available. Development of Ten Seaports in Eastern Zhejiang. Mr. Zhuang Songfu, former member of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee, has gathered funds to organize a large shipping company in order to facilitate commercial transport in Eastern Zhejiang and develop maritime transportation in Xiangshan, so as to benefit the people of Daishan, Xiangshan, Ninghai, and other places traveling to Shanghai and various ports. The preparations have been going on for many months and have now been successfully completed. The company officially opened today. The details of the company are as follows: Capital: The registered capital of the shipping company is 500,000 yuan, with the aim of developing a large port in the East, hence the company is named Donggang Shipping Company. The Shanghai head office is located opposite the water tower at the Damatou in the Nanshi. Branch offices are established in Xiangshan and Ninghai. The company's business is mainly transporting goods and passengers. Currently, one ship is operating first. Vessels: The company purchased a 1,000-ton steel ship for 80,000 yuan and named it Shengli. The entire ship has been overhauled and is brand new. Regular service is now being launched. The ship was originally scheduled to depart last night, but was delayed by one day due to the wind. The ship is docked at the Ning Shao No. 2 Wharf. The compradore is He Fengwen. If the business improves, passenger seats will be added to the ship. If it develops in the future, a second ship will be purchased. Routes: The ship is currently scheduled to travel from Shanghai to Daishan, Putuo, Shenjiamen, Guoyu, Dasong, Xiangshan, Fenghua, Ninghai, Xiashan, and Xueao. In the past, passengers and goods from these places had to transfer to civilian boats to Ningbo before transferring to ships to Shanghai. Now, they can sail directly, reducing the hardship of transshipment along the way. The schedule is tentatively set for Shanghai to depart on Mondays and Thursdays, and Ninghai to depart on Wednesdays and Saturdays.</p>

<p>The Wenhui Daily reported that the Industrial and Commercial Bank at the corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road did not open its doors this morning (3rd), which alarmed the financial community.

<h3 id="e156">Petition to Restrict the Establishment of New Cocoon Exchanges <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangzhe Silk Weaving Joint Association previously resolved at an emergency general meeting to petition the government ministries and the Jiangzhe provincial governments to, based on the precedent of 1921, prohibit the establishment of new cocoon exchanges and cocoon stoves within the old prefectures of the two provinces. This was intended to enrich the raw materials for silk weaving and maintain the livelihood of industry and commerce. The drafting was done by the document section, revised and issued by the standing chairman Wang Jie’an. The telegram is recorded below (omitting titles). We believe that silk is an important industry with large production in our country. National tax revenue and the people's livelihood all depend on it. Since the mutual trade between China and foreign countries, various countries have competed to imitate and manufacture foreign silk fabrics, which are shipped to China for sale, increasing day by day. Because they lack raw silk materials, they come to China to compete for the purchase of fresh cocoons, absorbing them as much as possible. The general farmers also compete to sell cocoons for the convenience of sale. In the past, all were sold as silk, but now less than one in ten is sold this way. As a result, native silk is in great shortage and demand exceeds supply. There is a great difficulty in buying raw materials for silk weaving. This is the fundamental panic of the silk weaving industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. If a solution is not quickly sought, it is feared that the silk weaving industry, our important national essence, will disappear. In the spring of 1921, we drafted five articles for rectifying the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and submitted them to the Beijing Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce for review. On March 13 of the same year, the Ministry issued Order No. 500, revising them into six articles, ordering them to be followed. We received this order and found that the first article (No new cocoon exchanges or cocoon stoves shall be established in the old Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Shaoxing, and Zhuji prefectures of Zhejiang, and the old Ningbo, Suzhou, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and Songjiang prefectures of Jiangsu, in order to enrich the raw materials for weaving) is a fundamental measure to protect the silk industry in the nine prefectures of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. However, over time, it was taken lightly and treated as a mere formality. In recent years, cocoon exchanges have sprung up like forests in the old prefectures, arbitrarily adding establishments without any restrictions. Among them, the Japanese merchants in Jiangsu are doing their best to purchase cocoons, which is especially ambitious, causing our country's silk weaving to have no silk to buy, forming a silk shortage. Therefore, the silk weaving industry in the two provinces has requested relief. Our association specially convened an emergency meeting of silk weaving colleagues from various places in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces on June 22 to discuss this case. The whole body unanimously resolved to petition the National Government, the Party Department, the ministries, and the governments and offices of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, requesting that the six articles of rectification measures be re-emphasized according to the precedent of 1921, and that a clear order be issued to maintain silk raw materials and enrich the national treasury's income, and to preserve raw materials, increase the production of domestic goods, and relieve unemployed workers. There is nothing better than this. It is reasonable to follow the discussion and submit the original method of justification, and to instruct the governments of the two provinces, cities, and counties to strictly restrict the establishment of new cocoon exchanges and cocoon stoves, and to pray for instructions to be followed. This is for the convenience of the Party. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Joint Association kowtows.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's Raw Silk Inspection Office was established on July 1 of last year and has now reached its first anniversary. The colleagues of the office held a first anniversary celebration at 3 pm on the 1st, preparing tea and refreshments, and inviting colleagues from all offices of the bureau to attend the ceremony. After the ceremony, the chairman Zhong Xiu delivered an opening speech, saying that the office has been established for a week, and there is nothing to commemorate in terms of achievements. Today, we only have a few cups of water and simple refreshments to celebrate with you and ask for your advice. Next, Director Zou was invited to give a speech, saying that the significance of today's commemoration is not only in the bustle and celebration, but also in seeking the development of the office's business. Seeing the spirit of unity and cooperation of all colleagues in the office today, the development can be expected. It was decided that Deputy Director Fei, Director Chen Shunyun of the Livestock and By-products Inspection Office, Director Zhang Weiru of the Chemical Inspection Office, Director Li Zhongxia of the Administrative Office, and Secretary Huang Zongxun, etc., delivered speeches in succession. Finally, there was English singing, such as "Because of You, Silk," and other entertainment. They dispersed happily at about 5 pm.</p>

<h3 id="e159">City General Labor Union Ends Under Orders <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Preparatory Committee Issues Declaration The Shanghai Special City General Labor Union Preparatory Committee yesterday announced its conclusion under the instructions of the Municipal Party Department and issued the following declaration: The highest organ of the city's workers, the City General Labor Union Preparatory Committee, has today received instructions from the Municipal Party Department to end. On this last day, we have to say a few words to the workers. We have shouldered the mission of preparing the General Labor Union, and we have indeed worked hard for the preparatory work. This is proven by the facts. We hope that the formal General Labor Union will be established within three months, so as not to disappoint the commission of the Municipal Party Department and the expectations of the workers. At the same time, we are also workers, and of course we also hope that the General Labor Union can be established as soon as possible. The date of the establishment of the association was September last year, when the Labor Union Law had not yet been promulgated, so in our ideal, the formal General Labor Union must be a matter of course. Unexpectedly, in November last year, the Labor Union Law that workers had been looking forward to was promulgated, but in this Labor Union Law, there is no General Labor Union. Then the General Labor Union lost the legal basis, and the future of the association was also thorny. Three months after the establishment of the association, all the preparatory work was completed. We represented the will of the city's workers and submitted a request to the superior level for approval to establish a formal General Labor Union. However, the Municipal Party Department could not accommodate our request because of the Labor Union Law. We submitted more than a dozen documents requesting the establishment of the General Labor Union. At the same time, members of the Municipal Party Department once petitioned the central government for the General Labor Union issue. However, the central government has consistently refused to allow it because of the law. A few days ago, the Municipal Party Department received instructions from the central government to revoke the association. Therefore, the Municipal Party Department formally instructed the association yesterday to end the day and send personnel to organize the industry labor union associations, such as the publishing industry, yarn factory industry, etc., to share the association. In this environment, there is indeed no better way to establish the General Labor Union. We can only follow the instructions of the Party Department and completely end it today, and wait for the personnel to take over. This is the process of the association's end that workers should know. The General Labor Union Committee ends today. As long as the workers can realize that they are moving towards the right path of developing production and relieving the suffering of workers, and redoubling their efforts, the labor movement will also have a bright day. We hope that the workers will continue to hold the revolutionary spirit of the workers and continue to work hard and forge ahead. This is what we are praying for today.

<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has recently been expanding its affairs, and in addition to assigning commissioners to handle the work of each department on a daily basis, it has also formed ten subcommittees. In the event of special accidents and development plans, the subcommittees are responsible for properly arranging coping methods and sending them to the Standing Committee for discussion. The committee includes ten subcommittees: attendance, economy, patrol and transportation, branches, propaganda, library, publishing, promotion, communication, and competition. Each group holds a meeting once a week and a joint meeting of each group once every two weeks to report on the progress of each group. The association has more than 400 anti-drug comrade associations in various places, and the scope is the widest. It is difficult to manage, and many of them have not been able to follow the association's regulations and plans due to lack of economic talent. The association has specially reduced the scope and uniformly changed to anti-drug propaganda associations, which are responsible for awakening compatriots and publicizing anti-drug efforts, and must not hear about other matters. Detailed regulations are currently being drafted by the subcommittee and will be announced to the branches in various places soon. Its nature is different from that of the Anti-Drug Comrades Association. Those that have already been established, the association also intends to re-strictly stipulate and send personnel to visit the branches in various places. The association also intends to send personnel to organize those that have not been established in order to strengthen support. Recently, overseas Chinese have successively reported on the establishment of branches, and foreign sympathetic groups have recently sent personnel to the association for contact, such as the German Women's Grand Alliance and the British Women's Suffrage Association, etc., have sent representatives to China to express cooperation with the association, and Director General Huang has received them separately, and stated the determination of our people to reject drugs, hoping for international cooperation. The League of Nations' Special Committee on Narcotic Drugs will hold a meeting at the end of this year to discuss the issue of narcotic drugs. China has suffered greatly from narcotic drugs, and the relationship with this meeting is extremely important. The association is currently preparing materials and intends to send personnel to report on the state of China's drug abuse and expose the great powers' conspiracy to poison China. The association hopes that all sectors will pay attention to this. Health Bureau</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal National Arts Museum held the opening ceremony of the third session of the Membership Solicitation Conference at the Central Western Restaurant the day before yesterday and welcomed the new directors to the museum. The director of the museum Zhang Yuejun (represented by Ling Dechang) (the deputy director Yuan Ludeng was absent due to official business and Wang Yunwu was unable to attend due to his trip to the United States), and the new directors Wang Xiaolai, and the captains, deputy captains, staff officers, etc. of the solicitation team more than 70 people. The chairman first stood up and gave a speech, saying that today the museum is holding the third session of the Solicitation Conference and welcoming the new directors. Director Zhang is unable to attend in person due to official business. My brother is representing him. I am very sorry to everyone, please forgive me. Today's gathering has two meanings. The first is to welcome the new directors. The museum has recently hired Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Zhang Xiaolin, Mr. Chu Huiseng, Mr. Zhang Zhangru, Mr. Yu Yefeng, Mr. Tong Zhongyi, Mr. Wu Jianquan, Mr. Cheng Xiechun, and Mr. Wen Lanting as ten new directors. These people are very enthusiastic about the national arts. We believe that in the future, the strength of the museum will definitely increase a hundredfold, and the future is very optimistic. The second meaning is the opening of the third session of solicitation. In order to popularize the national arts, the museum holds a solicitation every year. We believe that the results of this solicitation will be better than the previous one, because people in the society now have a very deep belief in the national arts, and with the enthusiastic publicity of the captains, deputy captains, staff officers, etc., this is also very optimistic. The rest of the brothers will not say much. I would like to invite Mr. Chen Jiaqian to report on the situation of the museum in the past year. Next, Mr. Chen Jiaqian, the managing director of the museum, reported on the situation in the past year and the purpose of this solicitation. After the banquet, Mr. Ye Liang, the managing director of the museum, performed Shaolin boxing and double knives, and Ms. Wu Yinghua (the daughter of Mr. Wu Jianquan) was invited to perform Tai Chi sword. Finally, the instructors and assistant instructors of the museum performed the national arts until 11 o'clock before dispersing.</p>

<p>The China Jisheng Association previously carried out relief work in many counties in Taizhou and Wenzhou, Zhejiang, and now it has been completed. The relief of Xiangshan has selected the areas that have been more severely affected by the disaster and publicly recommended Mr. Sun Yinting to go with the relief friends to distribute the aid, and it will be completed soon. It is now found that Cixi County has been barren for years, and the price of rice is soaring, and the people are struggling to make a living. The association colleagues, in view of this, purchased 2,000 piculs of rice to carry out price suppression, so that the poor people can really benefit from it. However, the number of rice is limited and it is difficult to popularize it. We can only investigate the household registration in Cixi City and issue tickets for purchase. We have publicly recommended Mr. Qin Runqing as the general director. Since Mr. Qin Runqing cannot be stationed in Cixi for a long time, his nephew, Mr. Jing, is acting on his behalf, accompanied by relief friends Yin Shunzhang and Dong Yongkang, etc., and they went to set up a bureau to start business immediately. The rice and stone have now been transported to the place for storage and sale. The association has recently sent a letter to the Cixi County Government to supervise the military police to suppress and protect.</p>

Farmers sell their plowing cattle and are about to sell them all. Workers sell their daughters to make a living. The salt and money merchants and the yarn factories raised huge sums of money to start price suppression first. The newly appointed magistrate Li Leng, together with the city gentry Zhu Tinghua, came to Shanghai to report to the huge merchants in Shanghai and beg for relief. The Jiangyin Fellow Association immediately convened a committee meeting, and the huge merchants Xue Liquan and Xi Han, etc., generously contributed huge sums of money. On the one hand, the committee members went to raise funds to continue the relief and benefit the hometown.</p>

<p>Biscuit, Candy and Canned Food Industry The Shanghai Biscuit, Candy and Canned Food Industry Association, in view of the fact that the price of various raw materials is affected by the price of gold and has soared by multiples, but it is still sold at the old price, which is difficult to maintain the cost. A meeting was convened yesterday. Zhang Yibiao, the chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting and said that although many of the raw materials used in the industry are domestic, such as sugar, spices, colors, tin cans, iron sheets, printing paper, etc., either directly or indirectly, most of them depend on foreign goods, and the import price has soared.

<h3 id="e177">A Visit with Huang Baiying <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Baiying's Outraged Words Against Sanmao</p>
<p>Said That Woman Will Surely Be Punished by Law</p>
<p>Will Testify and Describe Everything at Next Hearing</p>
<p>The case of the dancer Huang Baiying being forced to take poison has caused a great uproar in Shanghai. Since the incident, the newspapers have raced to publish detailed reports, though with some discrepancies. However, the main points are as reported in this newspaper a day earlier. Since Baiying suffered this misfortune, she has been staying indoors. The singing and dancing venues are all talking about this. As the facts of this case have already been presented to the readers, and Bai Niang, a weak woman, was fiercely loved by Zhang and Tong, and the ending has taken a strange turn, the matter is similar to Haggard's novels. The remnants of flowers and drifting catkins are filled with sadness, and her situation is also pitiful. Therefore, I took some time one evening to visit Bai and have a heart-to-heart red-light night talk, which only increased my feelings of being a rootless duckweed. I will describe it in detail below.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Baiying Yesterday <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>

<h3 id="e179">Baiying Writes Another Heartbreaking Letter <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>My heart is broken as I write this letter. You can only read the words and perhaps imagine the situation at the time. Under the lamp, I quietly watched her supporting the table and writing. The pen moved rapidly, and her resentment flowed from her wrist. Baiying's face showed fear and determination. After finishing each sentence, she would bite her lip and nod, her fingers trembling slightly, and her loose hair hanging down. She would often brush it up with her left hand. After finishing, she handed it to me to read. The words read: "Hui Lin, I did not expect your graduation ceremony to trigger my death. But when you know I am dead, do not be sad. People are all going to die anyway. But I only worry about Aunt Yi and my sister. They are my confidantes and understand me the most. Although this death is forced upon me, it can also show my love for you, Baiying." After reading, I glanced at Baiying and said, "Doesn't this language of yours indicate a determination long ago? The descriptions are so sad." Bai raised her voice and said, "I would rather sacrifice myself. Mr. Zhang's parents are both alive and he already has a wife. I definitely don't want to implicate others because of me." The heartbreaking note and the last words faced each other, making one feel sad.</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Guest Room is Elegantly Furnished <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Baiying's residence is in the French Concession, in the Wanyi Lane on Luban Road. The house is very new and she has only moved in recently. I sent in my card, and an old woman answered the door. "Does the gentleman want to meet Miss? Please sit down for a moment while I go upstairs to inform her." So I sat down on the sofa and looked around. The furnishings in the room were quite simple. In the center was a small rectangular table, covered with a rose-colored felt tablecloth. On the table was a flower basket. From a distance, the buds seemed to have all bloomed and lacked vitality. But upon closer inspection, they were paper-made wax flowers. A long sofa was placed against the wall, with two chairs on either side. In the corner of the room were a refrigerator and a gramophone, and another cabinet with various glassware. Near the window, long curtains hung down to the ground, and one could roughly see the inside of the room from the door. On the wall hung a small portrait of Baiying and three or four photos of movie stars. Under the ceiling, a large gauze lamp hung, and the light was soft. I waited for about two or three minutes, and then the once-famous Bai Niang gracefully entered the room.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Her Appearance is Extremely Haggard <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>I first heard a slight cough coming from the inner room. Looking back, it was indeed Baiying. Her curly hair was draped over her shoulders, almost covering her eyebrows, and her appearance was extremely haggard. Under the lamp, she looked even paler. She bowed slightly as she greeted me, and I saw that her feet were bare, wearing only slippers made of white satin covered with red flowers. After exchanging pleasantries, I asked, "The court hearing was held a few days ago, but you didn't go. I suppose it was because you weren't feeling well?" Bai replied, "Indeed, as you say. The doctor ordered me to rest and not to talk. And since being forced to take the poison, I have been confused and haven't recovered all day. I'm afraid that my illness would affect my testimony." That evening, Bai Niang wore a short-sleeved top and a vest of apricot green, while the vest was white with black edges. The color of her pants was the same as her top.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Baiying's Nervousness <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>"Did the lady also provide any information about Mr. Tong?" Baiying hesitated slightly, then spoke frankly, "If the judge asks me how Mr. Tong should be punished, I will only follow the court's decision. That woman will surely be punished by law, no need to say more." At this time, Bai had already sat down, facing inward with both hands on the table. Whenever she spoke of the words "Mr. Tong," she would frown and show displeasure. I asked about the already revealed facts, such as going out from the dance hall, driving around in the western suburbs of Shanghai, and taking poison in the hotel. She either nodded in agreement or tapped the table to indicate corrections. Her expression was very nervous.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Her Upper Eyelids Were Slightly Red and Purple <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Baiying's pale face, reflected by the lamp, revealed a look of fatigue. Her eyelashes were often closed, and her upper eyelids were slightly red and purple. One could imagine the severity of her illness. Everything she said was very moving. She claimed that after taking the medicine, she forced herself to stay awake, walking back and forth in the room and circling it several times. Tong forced her to sit down, but she refused each time. After being forced repeatedly, she sat on the sofa, and Tong put his arms on the back of the chair, his face sinking as he said to Bai, "What exactly do you want?" Meaning, to marry or to die. Bai resolutely replied, "Nothing." This was a firm rejection. Bai often used English phrases when talking to me, such as "Marry or die" and "I don't care."</p>
<h3 id="e184">Will Testify and Describe Everything at the Hearing <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>I asked again, "Will the lady also prepare to appear in court next Monday when the court hearing is held?" Bai replied, "At that time, I will testify and describe everything in detail to clarify the truth and seek the judgment of the law." Bai was very excited during her speech. Judging from her behavior and listening to her conversation, I think she is neurotic. Fearing that too much talk would harm her health, I immediately took my leave.</p>
<h3 id="e185">A Big Fire in Nanshi Last Night <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yiyuan Medicinal Material Store Was Careless</p>
<p>Total Losses Amounted to Over 20,000 Gold</p>
<p>The Yiyuan Medicinal Material Store, No. 26 Xunjidao in Nanshi, suddenly caught fire at around 7:00 PM last night. All the stored medicinal materials were reduced to ashes, with losses of over 10,000 gold. It was found that the Yiyuan Medicinal Material Store has been operating in Guo Xian Gua Street for many years, with a large scale. The shop owner and manager is Jiang Jixiang, and the assistant manager is Zhu Baohua. Their warehouse has six buildings and several bungalows, guarded by the old accountant Gao Ruqi. He goes to the shop during the day and sleeps in the warehouse at night. At around 7:00 PM last night, Mr. Gao had not yet returned to the warehouse. During this time, the clerk of the engraving shop next door suddenly saw green smoke rising from the warehouse. Knowing that there was a fire, he immediately sent an apprentice to the pharmacy to ask Gao to return. When Gao arrived, the fire was raging and there was no way to put it out. The fire department rushed to the scene after receiving the alarm and tried their best to put out the fire. It was not until 8:30 PM that it gradually subsided. All six buildings were burned down, and the stored medicinal materials were also reduced to ashes. The medicinal materials were worth about 15,000 yuan, plus the buildings, totaling no less than 20,000 gold. The cause of the fire may have been caused by throwing cigarette butts. It is still under investigation. Fortunately, the surrounding neighbors were not affected; otherwise, the losses would have been even greater. Coastal Ships</p>
<h3 id="e186">Were Again Stopped by Wind Yesterday <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Datong Wheel Damaged its Propeller and Stopped Sailing</p>
<p>The other day, Shanghai experienced a strong wind, and the Tai Gu Ning Shao's Shanghai-Ningbo rounds were all suspended, and the commercial rounds along the Zhejiang coast were also blocked for a day. Yesterday afternoon, there was a hurricane warning, and various commercial rounds in Shanghai were again blocked and could not exit. The situation is described below.</p>
<p>First Wind Blockade</p>
<p>The first strong wind occurred on the 2nd. In addition to the formal announcement of the suspension of the Xin Beijing and Xin Ning Shao rounds, the Shanghai-Taiwan rounds, Wenzhou rounds, and Chuanshan rounds of Zhejiang Shipping also did not dare to set sail. Only the Yangtze River round operated as usual. It was not until noon yesterday that the wind gradually subsided, and the blocked Wen, Tai, and Zhoushan rounds were able to exit one after another. There were more than a dozen rounds entering Wusong yesterday noon to avoid the wind. In total, 29 ships came to Shanghai yesterday, most of which were delayed due to the wind blockade.</p>
<p>Second Suspension</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai-Ningbo rounds of China Merchants' Xin Jiangtian and Sanbei's Ningxing rounds had loaded all the export goods and passengers at around 3:00 PM and were waiting to depart at 5:00 PM. However, at around 5:00 PM, the Jianghai Customs issued a notice stating that according to the observatory report, there would be strong winds on the sea that night, making navigation very dangerous. Please stop the exit of the two rounds. After receiving the report, China Merchants Sanbei stated that the two rounds to Putuo were mostly booked by passengers. If they were suspended this time, the losses would be huge. They sent someone to the Customs to inquire about whether they could still depart. As a result, they were afraid of danger. For the safety of passengers, the two bureaus decided to suspend the voyage with pain. At around 6:00 PM, they notified the passengers, stating that the suspension due to wind avoidance was due to the Customs' intention and could not be forced. At this time, many passengers left the ship and went ashore.</p>
<p>Blocked Ships</p>
<p>After the customs warning was issued, more than a dozen coastal rounds that were scheduled to depart yesterday, such as Shengli, etc., were unable to depart. The docks in Nanshi were almost full, all waiting for orders to start. Most of them will have to wait until today to depart.</p>
<p>Datong Engine Damage</p>
<p>The Tai Gu Company's Yangtze River round Datong was scheduled to depart on Thursday yesterday. This time, the round came to Shanghai from Hankou downstream. While traveling, the rudder blade of its engine suddenly broke and could not operate. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, it unloaded all the cargo and towed it into the shipyard for major repairs. It will have to stop for ten days, resulting in the company's Yangtze River rounds being empty yesterday and no ship departing. Qin Liang Fights with Anger Over</p>
<h3 id="e187">Wife and Daughter's Degradation, Throws Himself into the River <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Wife Smokes Opium, Daughter Prostitutes</p>
<p>Unable to Stop, Unwilling to Live</p>
<p>Qin Liangfa, a 53-year-old man from Ningbo, boarded the Ketai ferry at the Hankou Road dock at around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday to cross the Huangpu River. When the round arrived at the Puxi surface of Lujiazui, Qin suddenly took advantage of the unpreparedness and jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, the sailor rescued him on the spot and sent him to the Water Patrol Police Station. According to his confession, he lived at No. 34 Sanxin Lane, Ainage Road, Beizhu Bridge, French Concession, and was originally a foreign goods broker. His parents, both over 70 years old, were still in his hometown. He was the second of three brothers. His wife, Zhu, was from Jiangbei, 39 years old, and had two sons and a daughter. The eldest son, who was twenty, was learning the foreign goods business. The second son, who was twelve, was sent to a voluntary school by his wife. The daughter, named Yongdi, was sixteen. At the age of fourteen, she was pawned by his wife to Han Village in the same village (commonly known as Salted Meat Village) for prostitution, with a limit of six months and a pawn price of 140 yuan. In June last year, she was redeemed at the original price. However, his wife was addicted to opium and still relied on her daughter to sell her body to make a living. Seeing his wife and daughter taking this low path, he repeatedly tried to stop them, but they would not listen. Therefore, he was angry and threw himself into the river to end everything. It was the truth. The police station sent detective Huang Songsheng to go to the address and summon his wife, Zhu, and daughter, Yongdi, to the police station. According to Zhu's confession, the family was extremely poor, and her husband had no major income. She had no choice but to let her daughter engage in this lowly profession to make a living. Yongdi also confessed that after being redeemed last year, she met a patron who loved her very much. He voluntarily wanted to marry her, but seeing her father's violent temper, the agreement was terminated. Her father's obstruction caused the relationship to break down, and she was unable to escape the lowly profession. It was the thing she hated the most in her life. After verifying the confession, the police chief ordered the detective to transfer the three to the local court in the afternoon. Prosecutor Yang specially opened the court (the court was originally scheduled to stop hearing in the afternoon during the summer vacation) and conducted a preliminary hearing. According to the previous confessions of the three, the judge announced his opinion and first sent Qin's wife, Zhu, to the hospital to quit smoking. Qin nodded in agreement. The official asked Yongdi who she wanted to follow, and she replied that she wanted to follow her mother. The official said that if she followed her mother, she would also have to be sent to the hospital. When Yongdi heard this, she was unwilling. The judge ruled in court that Yongdi should be returned to her father for custody. Zhu was returned to the hospital. Unexpectedly, as soon as the father and daughter left the court, Yongdi suddenly shouted for a rickshaw, sat in it alone, and left, ignoring Qin. Qin tried to stop her, but it was too late. He watched Yongdi disappear from near to far. Qin only shouted in anger and returned home in frustration.</p>

<h3 id="e189">A Fierce Battle of Detectives and Thieves <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Robbed Fifty Yuan</p>
<p>Two Thieves Arrested</p>
<p>At around 8:00 PM yesterday, three thieves stood in front of the Shengtai South Goods Store at No. 1057 Linping Road, Yangshupu, Shanghai East, but did not rob because there were still several people buying food in the store at that time. The thieves did not move. After a while, the buyers dispersed, and the three thieves entered the store and searched the counter. However, the Shengtai South Goods Store was located in a remote area of Shanghai East, and the business was not very prosperous. The daily income was limited. As a result, they robbed 50 yuan. After the thieves left the store, the shop assistants rushed to report to the nearby police. The Chinese police, outnumbered, immediately reported to the Yangshupu Police Station by telephone. The police chief rushed the Chinese and foreign detectives in a police car to the destination to chase the thieves. The car was very fast, and in a flash, it had passed the destination. Seeing three people walking on the road, their expressions were panicked and they were walking fast. The detectives knew they were not good people and shouted for them to stop. The three ran wildly again. The detectives immediately got out of the car, and the three pulled out their guns and aimed at the detectives. Because of poor eyesight, they did not hit. The detectives, for self-defense, immediately drew their guns and returned fire. For a time, bullets rained down, and pedestrians took cover. As a result, two of the three thieves were injured and fell to the ground. One thief ran away. A gun was found beside the thieves. The detectives immediately sent the two thieves to the Bureau of Works hospital for treatment and further interrogation.</p>

<p>Blindly Fighting, Heads Broken and Bleeding</p>
<p>At around 3:40 PM yesterday, five blind fortune tellers who walked the streets suddenly came to a tiger stove in a market town in Caogjadu, Shanghai West on Jisi Feier Road and sat around a table to chat and sip tea. Suddenly, one of the blind men, Xu Jinbao, had a money dispute with Bai Haiquan and Zhang Yongshun, two other blind men. At first, they quarreled with each other, and then the blind fire rushed straight up. The three jumped up and blindly fought each other. Some held iron plates and smashed them hard, while others smashed the huqin wildly. The two blind men who were sitting together tried to blindly persuade them, but they were also beaten. For a while, the onlookers laughed wildly. When the police arrived, Xu Jinbao's head had been broken by Bai and Zhang, and blood was flowing like a fountain. They immediately arrested the five blind men and a young guide and took them to the Sixth District Police Station for interrogation.

<h3 id="e193">Accusing Husband of Abandonment, Requesting Divorce <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Judge's Reconciliation Ineffective</p>
<p>Ordered to Await Sentencing</p>
<p>Wang Heqing, a young woman from Zhenhai, recently hired lawyer Chen Jinrong to sue her husband Zhao Guanquan in the local court for malicious abandonment and failure to provide support, etc. The case was tried yesterday by Judge Tong Shenglv in the fourth court. The plaintiff, Wang Heqing, stated that she was 22 years old and currently lived at No. 23 Shouxing Lane, outside the West Gate, in a relative's home. She married the defendant Zhao Guanquan in 1926. After the marriage, their opinions differed and they were often glared at each other, indicating that they could not live together. Although the defendant was working in a customs brokerage firm at the time, earning 50 or 60 yuan a month, he spent all his time indulging in pleasure and did not care about the family. The plaintiff and her aunt had to do laundry to make a living and pawn items to get by. The love between husband and wife had been completely severed. Last year, when the defendant's business stopped, there was often no food to cook. When she reasoned with him, she was beaten. Therefore, she came to the court to request a divorce. The defendant, Zhao Guanquan, stated that he was 24 years old, from Zhenhai, and lived at No. 8 Shenyuli, Dajing Street, Xiaobeimen. He did not abuse her. Although he was currently unemployed, he still managed the family's livelihood. He did not want a divorce. He wanted to live together. The official got the confession and tried to reconcile them in court, stating that husband and wife should have a spirit of mutual assistance. Even if the woman did not necessarily have to be supported by the man, the woman should also work. It was best for a woman to be faithful to one man and not divorce. The plaintiff said that if husband and wife loved each other, she would be willing to beg for food. But she was abused even with little to eat and wear. How could she survive? The official asked the defendant how he survived now that he was unemployed. He replied that he borrowed money. However, his brother-in-law was willing to help him and barely get by. The judge repeatedly persuaded them, but the plaintiff insisted on divorce, wasting the judge's hour of effort. The reconciliation was unsuccessful. The judge then asked prosecutor Lei to come to the court to express his opinion, and the plaintiff's lawyer recounted the case. The judge then ordered that the debate be concluded and to await sentencing before adjourning the court. Huang Lianghua</p>

<p>Zhu Yiren habitually deceives others. A woman surnamed Zhang, wife of Kou from Huizhou, is 41 years old and resides at No. 8, Jianye Li, near the Shanghai Military Camp in the South Market. She has a son named Songquan, now 23, who works as a hall attendant at a Huizhou restaurant. The wife, surnamed Gao, is 18 and of passable appearance. Because her husband's monthly income is meager, their relationship is not harmonious. Zhang has a neighbor, Xia Jiang, from Shaoxing, who is 42 years old and resides at No. 5 of the same lane. She has a daughter named Lin Di, now 16, who is already mature like an adult and works as a sock-knitting girl in a sock factory. Due to their neighborly relationship, Lin Di became acquainted with Gao and they became very close. On the afternoon of the 1st of this month, Gao excused herself, saying she was going to the sock factory, and went out with Lin Di. They then went to the Xiaoshijie Amusement Park. While they were sightseeing, Huang Lianghua (22 years old) from Wuxi, accompanied by Zhu Yiren, also happened to be there, and they met Lin Di and Gao. Zhu and Lin Di were already acquainted, so they greeted each other upon meeting. Zhu then introduced Gao to Huang, and they chatted and became very fond of each other, lamenting that they had not met sooner. When the theater show ended around midnight, Gao and the others feared being scolded at home for returning so late. Huang then escorted them to the DongSheng Hotel in the North Market's Little Flower Garden and opened room No. 67. Zhu then made an excuse to leave. As the room only had one single bed, Lin Di lay on the sofa, while Huang and Gao shared the bed and had a good time. The next day, Zhang Kou was worried that her daughter-in-law Gao had claimed to go to the sock factory with her neighbor Xia Jiang's daughter Lin Di, but had not returned for a long time. Suspecting something amiss, she immediately searched everywhere but found nothing. Zhang and Xia's families became very anxious. Suddenly, Zhu Yiren came to Xia Jiang's house and said, "I can help you find your missing daughter." The family did not suspect anything and were overjoyed, so they gave Zhu Lin Di's photo for identification. Soon after Zhu left, he went to the Second Bureau of the Solicitation Department on Fangbang Road and reported the situation to the clerk, Yun Luping, from Changzhou. Yun, upon hearing this, instructed Yun to go to Jianye Li and contact the Zhang and Xia families, but first demanded fifty yuan as a reward, promising a generous reward upon success. Yun, tempted by the money, immediately went to the Zhang and Xia families with his friend Xu Lin and said, "We can find Lin Di and Gao, but you must first pay us fifty yuan as a reward." Xia Jiang, upon hearing that there was a lead, secretly reported the matter to the First District, First Precinct. Patrol officers He Ziming, Li Dianqing, Zhu Dekang, and Wu Desheng were dispatched and arrested Yun and Xu, taking them back to the precinct for questioning. They learned that Huang and the others were hiding in the DongSheng Hotel. Detectives were then dispatched, accompanied by constables, to the address, where they arrested Huang, Xia Lin Di, and Zhang Gao, three men and women, and brought them back to the precinct. During the preliminary hearing by the chief of the precinct, Huang confessed to all the details of the adultery with Zhang Gao. The chief of the precinct, considering the matter important, ordered them to be detained separately for further investigation.</p>

<p>Due to Intolerable Abuse by the First Wife, Official Order Still Directs Her to Return Home to Live. Cao, the concubine of Jin Muan, who resides at No. 1, Yongji Li, Wangzhi Road, in the French Concession, recently suffered constant humiliation and scolding from the first wife, and was also abused by a friend of her husband, Fu Shufu. Unable to endure the suffering, she sought help from the Good Samaritan Institution the other day. The Good Samaritan Institution notified the French police, who ordered Detective Liu Youfa to summon Fu Shufu to the French Court yesterday morning. Jin Cao was also sent to court by the Good Samaritan Institution. According to Jin Cao's statement, she married Jin Muan with the understanding that she would be the legal wife, but later learned that the master already had a wife. At that time, the woman endured it without complaint, as what was done could not be undone. Recently, the husband went out to do business, leaving the woman at home with the first wife and the husband's friend, Fu Shufu. Unexpectedly, Fu and the first wife developed a love affair and saw the woman as a thorn in their side. The woman even served the first wife as a maid, but they still showed no sympathy and instead insulted and scolded her. The woman accused Fu Shufu of aiding the abuse, beating her severely with a rattan cane, leaving visible injuries, which she requested to be examined. This forced her to seek help from the Good Samaritan Institution. Her husband had also been listening to the first wife's slander and harbored resentment towards her. Now, no matter what, the woman did not want to go home and requested to be released. Fu Shufu confessed that he was a friend of Jin Muan and was temporarily staying at his house. He denied aiding the abuse, offering evasive statements. Judge Zhu sentenced Fu to a fine of thirty yuan as a warning. Jin Cao was still ordered to return home, and it was stipulated that if there was any further abuse, she was allowed to report it to the police for investigation.</p>

<p>How Should Electrical Appliances Be Installed? Careful Inspection Is Necessary to Avoid Future Troubles. At 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, during a sudden rainstorm, Chen, the wife of Liu Zhaolian, the owner of a sesame cake stall at the corner of Haifang Road and Gordon Road in West Shanghai, leaned against the counter of the cigarette and paper shop at No. 709 next door, holding onto the iron railing on the counter. Because the iron railing was in contact with an electrical wire, the iron conducted electricity, and the current flowed into her body. She immediately became numb and fell to the ground. Her husband, upon hearing the news, rushed over to help her up. As soon as he touched her, the electricity in her body was transmitted to Liu Zhaolian, and he also fell to the ground. The Gordon Road police precinct was notified and dispatched detectives to the scene, who managed to transport the couple to Dehe Hospital for treatment. However, the electrical poisoning spread rapidly, and by the time they arrived at the hospital, the poison had already reached their hearts, and they both died. The two bodies were then transported to the Feilun Road morgue for an autopsy. Detectives were ordered to investigate whether the electrical appliances in the shop were installed according to the regulations of the Public Works Department. If the installation was improper, they were ordered to correct it to prevent future troubles. Yesterday morning, the Special District Local Court was requested to send Prosecutor Xu to the morgue for an autopsy. It was confirmed that they had died from electric shock. However, according to the Western constable, the installation of the electrical appliances and the cause of the accident had not yet been determined and required further investigation. Prosecutor Xu, noting that the couple had no relatives in Shanghai, ordered their bodies to be handed over to the Pushan Villa for coffining and burial. The police were ordered to investigate and verify whether there was any negligence in the installation of the electric meter in the cigarette and paper shop.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Further Interrogation in the Wang Baosan Murder Case <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>All the Accused Recanted Their Previous Confessions, Awaiting Interrogation of Witnesses. Wang Baosan, who ran a night soil business at the Xiangyan Bridge on Hu's Family Wooden Bridge, was murdered due to jealousy and competition for business with Dai Ruzhao and others in the same trade. On the evening of the first day of the second month of the lunar calendar this year, Dai Zhizhao colluded with Shi Fulin, Zhu Zixiang, Liu Luguanzi, Wang Guangfu, and others to go to Wang Baosan's house and shoot him to death. The Public Security Bureau arrested Dai, Shi, Zhu, Liu, and others and transferred them to the Local Court. Dai and the others had already been sentenced to life imprisonment and imprisonment for ten years or more. Now, the accomplices in the same case, Wang Guangfu and Wang Wankui, were also arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. After interrogation, they confessed to participating in the conspiracy and committing the murder. They were sent to the Local Court and also prosecuted. Yesterday morning, Magistrate Qian held a court session to interrogate the accused. Wang Guangfu and Wang Wankui both claimed that they did not participate in the murder of Wang Baosan. They stated that the confessions to the Public Security Bureau were completely fabricated and that they were forced to admit it after being subjected to private torture, including hanging. The judge then summoned the widow, Wang Shi, to testify. Wang Shi testified that Wang Baosan was her husband and that Liu Luguanzi, Wang Fuguang, and Dai Ruzhao killed her husband. It was on the first day of the second lunar month. Shi Fulin first came to her house and said that a boat had arrived and needed to be loaded with night soil. After Shi Fulin finished speaking and left, she went to close the door, and Liu Luguanzi immediately pushed the door open and shot her husband. Liu Luguanzi fired a total of four shots, hitting her husband's left hand, leg, back, and left rib. At that time, Zhu Zixiang also said that the person was not dead, so Dai Ruzhao fired another shot. She was near the table at the time, so Dai Ruzhao grabbed her and threw her aside, and Wang Guangfu kicked her away, and they fled. Wang Wankui was acting as a lookout outside the door. Shi Jinlin testified that Wang Baosan was her brother-in-law. She did not see him die. She heard her sister shouting for help at home. She was a neighbor and opened the door to see Wang Guangfu, Liu Luguanzi, Dai Ruzhao, Zhu Zixiang, Wang Wankui, Shi Fulin, and six or seven other people running away. At this point, the judge questioned Wang Wankui, who claimed that he had gone to Chongming with Zhang Youlang on the twenty-ninth day of the first month and returned home on the ninth day of the second month. Zhang Youlang lived in Qiyaozhen in Chongming. Wang Guangfu claimed that if Wang Shi had grabbed Dai Ruzhao and said that he kicked her away, why didn't he shoot her since he had a pistol at the time, leaving no evidence of his crime? At this point, the judge considered it necessary to have further evidence in the case and adjourned the hearing to a later date. The accused were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhangzhai Desperately Jumps into the River. At around 8:00 AM yesterday, a young man jumped into the river from the Baidu Bridge outside the mouth of the Suzhou River, attempting suicide. The Chinese constable No. 29 from the water patrol police noticed and rescued him, taking him to the police station for questioning. He claimed his name was Zhang Zhangzhai, 23 years old, from Ningbo. He had been working as a special investigator in a certain agency under the Central Government but was now unemployed. In his hometown this year, he fell in love with a woman, but she suddenly disappeared. Her father then filed a lawsuit with the county government, which ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest him and instructed him to find the woman within a month, or else he would be punished accordingly. Upon hearing the order, he had no choice but to search everywhere, but the deadline had passed, and he still could not find the woman. He could not return to his hometown, and he was penniless, so he resorted to this measure. The police chief, considering that he had a heavy responsibility, did not dare to make a decision on his own and sent Detective Ge Changsheng to escort him to the Local Court for further disposition by Yu Longzhang.</p>

<p>Yu Longzhang, a native of Ningbo, recently filed a lawsuit in the Local Court against Yu Cai, accusing her of seizing his father's inheritance and concealing the documents, requesting a judgment ordering her to hand them over for management. A court hearing was held but not concluded. Yesterday morning, a continuation hearing was held by Judge Zhang Jinjian. The plaintiff did not appear and was represented by lawyer Chen Wenzhao. Chen began by stating the plaintiff's age and hometown, stating that Yu Longzhang was twenty years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 17, Dongjie, Xiaodongmen, Shanghai, and stated the purpose of the lawsuit. Yu Longzhang's father, Yu Jinlin, died of illness on May 2nd of this year. The plaintiff's biological mother had three daughters and one son in total. The plaintiff's two older sisters, one died, one married, and one younger sister unmarried.

The defendant, Yu Cai, testified that she was 46 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 5, Yuyuli, Changsheng Bridge, Xiaodongmen. She married the plaintiff's father as his second wife in 1915. At that time, the plaintiff was only five years old. At this point, the defendant's lawyer presented the Yu family genealogy book as evidence, and according to the defendant's statement, the plaintiff and the defendant were entered into the genealogy at the same time when the plaintiff was sixteen years old. The plaintiff's lawyer stated, "Please note that the defendant claims to be the second wife, but why were they both entered into the genealogy at the same time when the plaintiff was sixteen years old? Please have the clerk record this." Yu Xingdi (i.e., the plaintiff's younger sister), who was also a participant, testified that she was 18 years old and that Cai had been in the family for 16 years as her father's concubine. The judge asked, "How do you express your opinion?" She replied, "My mother (referring to Cai) is alive and should manage the property." The plaintiff's lawyer stated, "Regardless, the plaintiff is the biological son and should inherit his father's inheritance." The judge then ordered the debate to begin and considered it concluded, setting the pronouncement date for the morning of the 7th of this month. Shenxin Textile Company.</p>

<p>Huimin Milk Powder Company proclaims that Huimin Milk Powder is made entirely from pure milk, with no impurities mixed in. Manufactured using the latest methods, it preserves the most nourishing annual milk vitamins, suitable for both young and old. It dissolves more easily than other milk powders and coarse milk substitutes, leaving no residue and with minimal waste. Its economic value is evident, not only is it exceptionally good, but it is also the most affordable milk powder on the market. Huimin Milk Powder comes in two varieties: red can and blue can. The blue can original milk powder contains 26% fat, and the red can infant milk powder has a reduced fat content of 10%. It is universally recognized by Chinese and Western doctors as the most beneficial beverage for children. It is sold in department stores, pharmacies, and food shops in various ports. Customers can choose at their convenience. The Anhui Bank Shanghai Branch proclaims that after the opening of the branch, coinciding with the completion of the new headquarters building, the branch has added several types of commemorative savings accounts with generous interest rates and stable guarantees. It also provides various exquisite commemorative leather wallets as gifts to depositors. The Ford Motor Company proclaims that the Ford cars participating in the 1930 Automobile Winter Rally initiated by the Royal Automobile Club of Sweden achieved excellent results. This rally is the most important event in Northern Europe. Of the three cars that received A-level first prizes, two were Ford cars. One Ford car team with three cars won an item. The C-level rally was designed for drivers participating in the rally for the first time. One Ford car also won the victory. The rally was particularly interesting due to special circumstances, making it more interesting than other rallies. The rally route was 600 miles long, starting from Gothenburg on the west coast, passing through the forests and mountains of central Sweden, north to Gävle on the east coast, and then along the coast to Stockholm. In addition to muddy roads, the route included slippery and windy streets with deep snow. Sometimes the cars were buried in snow, and the nighttime temperature was below zero degrees Celsius. Cars in the A-level rally should normally maintain an average speed of 34 to 37 miles per hour, but due to driving conditions on narrow, snowy, and winding roads, they had to travel at 50 miles per hour. There were stations along the way to manage the rally. Each car was limited to a 15-minute stop at each station. In addition, they could stop for half an hour after traveling half the distance. If the driver could race the entire route within an "ideal range," their name would be engraved on the "Winter Silver Cup." Those who achieve three victories would be awarded the trophy. The Lincoln Motor Company proclaims that the car manufacturing report published by the company states that each important part of the Lincoln car has been inspected separately. The company employs chemists, metallurgists, and scientists to conduct inspections and is equipped with various sophisticated instruments for this purpose. If any parts or materials do not meet the specified highest standards, they will be rejected upon arrival. All steel used for forging must have its appearance inspected by the company's chemical laboratory before shipment. It must be inspected again during shipment. Each time, it cannot be shipped without the approval of the chemical laboratory. Forged parts must also be inspected for the composition of their original material, as their hardness, strength, and various flaws cannot be distinguished by visual inspection. If it is found to be inconsistent with the specified standards, it will not be made into machine parts. Cast parts must be thoroughly inspected to ensure their stability. For example, each crankcase is hammered and drilled to ensure that there is no air inside. The various parts inside the Lincoln car, such as carburetors, generators, distributors, vacuum boxes, and speedometers, are purchased from companies specializing in manufacturing these parts. Each part is inspected when it arrives at the factory, not only inspecting the appearance of the entire batch of parts. This so-called thorough inspection is designed to supplement the Lincon factory representative stationed at the company supplying the parts.

Its novelty and beauty are very different from the previous two days. The New Oriental Theater on the north side of the Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road proclaims that the theater is divided into Beijing Opera and film performances.

The Star Film Company proclaims that its martial arts chivalry film "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" has been continuously produced for eleven episodes. Each episode has been a huge success. The twelfth episode has many new techniques in terms of photography that have never been seen in the other episodes. They are all made with meticulous production methods. Among them, the true and false Hong Gu (both played by Hu Die) changing from one person to two people, two people to three people, and three people to four people, and the scene of Dongfang Shi fighting with Hong Gu are all unprecedented and take a lot of time to film. Due to repeated requests from the outside world, this film has been advanced and will be screened at the Central Grand Theater starting tomorrow (the 5th). The Wuchang Grand Theater proclaims that the theater, in view of the hot weather, although it has a large number of electric fans, still has problems reaching everyone, so from the 1st, it stopped giving out cigarettes and instead gave customers a specially made exquisite fan from the Chinese and Western Pharmacy. As a result, many customers flocked to it. To thank customers for their appreciation, the theater has also spared no expense to screen the famous film "Flower of the Desert" starring the long-famous film queen Ke Lingmoya. The film is mournful and beautiful, touching everywhere. The Five-Star Film Company proclaims that since its establishment, the company has made rapid progress. Everything is ready at No. 111, Yokohama Road, Zhabei. It is now recruiting male and female actors.

<h3 id="e207">Rudiments of Philosophy by Wu Yuyang <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Written by A.S. Rappoport, Translated by Chen Xunshao, Published by The Commercial Press.</p>
<p>Philosophy is a discipline that studies the principles of various phenomena and their overall relationships. I believe that anyone who studies any discipline or handles affairs in society should study philosophy and understand philosophy. This is because I always feel that those who study specialized disciplines and those who handle affairs in society, because they do not understand philosophy, only go around in circles within their own specialized disciplines when studying, and only know how to treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts in society, unable to see the fundamental causes of various phenomena and unable to find an overall solution. This is not nonsense; if you pay close attention to others and yourself, you will understand. I originally studied political science, but I started my studies with philosophy. This is a matter of experience.</p>
<p>However, among all disciplines, perhaps none is as easily misunderstood by the general public as philosophy. The general public always thinks that philosophy is a kind of ethereal and unsubstantial thing, and studying philosophy is an idle pursuit. It is true that it is difficult to find a suitable philosophy book, especially introductory books, published in China in the past. They all explain philosophy too mystically, almost making readers unable to grasp the main point. Often, many enthusiastic young men and women give up reading philosophy books halfway through. And the teachers who teach philosophy courses in the first year of university often just copy and paste from various sources, using a large number of terms as magic weapons to show off their skills, making students dizzy. Universities also do not pay attention to this discipline at all (the opposite of European universities), so by the time they graduate from university, they are still confused. The problem of not understanding philosophy mentioned earlier is unavoidable. The above remarks are only to illustrate the importance of philosophy and attract attention. As for how to understand philosophy and arouse interest in research, I would like to recommend a book that may be of some help to everyone.</p>
<p>This book, "Rudiments of Philosophy," was recently published by The Commercial Press. I do not know the author or translator at all, but because I have read it carefully, I recognize its inherent value, so I dare to recommend it to everyone. Now, let me first introduce the contents of this book, and then introduce its advantages.</p>
<p>This book is divided into three parts. The first part is the meaning and content of philosophy, the second part is the evolution and trends of philosophy, and the third part is the schools and important issues of philosophy. These three parts can be said to explain the entire scope of philosophy to us.</p>
<p>The first part is introductory in nature, breaking open the mystery of philosophy for us. This part is divided into eight chapters. The first chapter is an introduction, explaining that the main idea of philosophy is to "explain the essence, origin, and interrelationships of all things." This definition could not be more comprehensive. It also explains that philosophy is divided into three major categories for the convenience of research: (1) singular problems (pure philosophy), (2) plural problems (natural philosophy), and (3) individual problems of living things (philosophy of life). Finally, it introduces the contents of philosophy: (1) metaphysics, (2) psychology, (3) epistemology, (4) logic, (5) aesthetics, (6) ethics, (7) philosophy of law, and (8) sociology and philosophy of history. The subsequent chapters provide an overview of each of the contents mentioned above.</p>
<p>The second part is a historical narrative, allowing us to understand the origins and trends of Western philosophy. This part is divided into five chapters. The first chapter is an introduction, explaining the periodization of the history of philosophy: (1) ancient period, (2) Middle Ages, (3) modern period, and (4) recent period. The subsequent four chapters provide an overview of these four periods, highlighting their important points and providing insightful critiques. In the fourth chapter, "Modern Period," the characteristics of the national character of various European countries are presented as the reason for the creation of various modern philosophical thoughts, with a critical eye.</p>
<p>The third part explains the schools of philosophy and their issues. This part is divided into five chapters. The first chapter states that the three ends of philosophy to be solved are: (1) content, (2) method, and (3) cause. For the convenience of research, the problems of philosophy are summarized into three major categories: (1) problems of pure philosophy, (2) problems of moral philosophy, and (3) problems of intellectual philosophy. The second chapter discusses the problems of pure philosophy, introducing the three major schools of modern pure philosophers concerning the basics of the existence of the universe: idealism, materialism, and dualism of mind and matter, and clarifies their origins. The third chapter discusses the problems of moral philosophy, presenting the moral problems that philosophers of all ages have pondered to solve: (1) the origin of moral concepts, (2) the obedience to moral concepts.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter discusses intellectual philosophy, dividing the content and function of intellectual philosophy into three items for explanation, which are: (1) The origin of Zhi, (2) Where Zhi comes from or its original problem, (3) Can Zhi be sought or its effectiveness and scope problem. The last chapter of the conclusion puts forward two problems to be solved by philosophy, the first is that philosophy should strive to solve, namely, what is the existant, how can things exist, what do we know, what is our duty, why are we so inferior. The second is that philosophy has a close relationship with the things of everyday existence, philosophy cannot be separated from reality, so the problem of philosophy is endless.</p>
<p>We can see the advantages of this book from its content, that is, it can systematically explain the whole field of philosophy in a small booklet, giving us a very clear concept of the outline of philosophy, the history of philosophical thought, and the important problems of philosophy. And its method of explanation is also very clear, and it can be added to a more objective criticism, so that beginners will not be confused about the system of philosophy and have the danger of preconceptions. As for the fluency of the translation and the popularity of the translation names, I also feel when I read it.</p>
<p>Finally, I have something to say, I introduce this introductory and small philosophy book, maybe some people say I am too boring, in fact, I do not know how to introduce profound and magnificent books, but the introductory is not clear what the profound can be said of, not from the smaller start, what is the meaning of grand works, I think the general public in society needs a kind of philosophical cultivation of riding a horse to give them a little guidance to study and work, as long as you spend a little time you can finish reading it, and it is also very worthwhile when life is busy and the heat is difficult to bear.</p>

<h3 id="e210">The Story of World Literature (1) (7) (4) by John Macy, Translated by Hu Zhongchi <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Chapter 46: Scandinavian Literature.</p>
<p>Among the prose writers of the latter half of the nineteenth century, there are several who are extremely outstanding. Jens Peter Jacobsen is the greatest prose artist produced by Denmark. He was a patient who died young and wrote with poignant care, like Flaubert. He sought the right words, the right rhythm, and spent a great deal of time on it. The result was two novels, "Marie Grubbe" and "Niels Lyhne," which had never been seen in Denmark that beautiful, and a collection of short stories with the title Mingens. Although he wrote so little, his influence was great, and his completion set a standard for Danish and Norwegian writers who were dedicated to beauty, style, and art, and his influence extended beyond Denmark. He was translated into German and at least partially into English.</p>
<p>After Jacobsen's untimely death, the novelist who temporarily stood in a leading position was Herman Bang, a realist who made meticulous observations of the low-middle classes of his own people and towns. His best work is "Tiny People." There is also a naturalist novelist, Peter Nansen, whose best novel, "Short Cut," is a profound and powerful work. Edvard Brandes must also be mentioned, whose reputation is somewhat obscured by the fact that he is the brother of the great critic Georg Brandes. However, Edvard was a critic of great talent, a playwright, and the author of two outstanding novels. Later, there appeared a great novelist who, in terms of time and spirit, is considered our contemporary: Henrik Pontoppidan. Until he received the Nobel Prize in 1917, English and American readers had never heard of the limitations he placed on the great literature created by small countries. Here is another example. Pontoppidan is a novelist with the power and sympathy we see in the great writers of Russia. His most beautiful novel, Lykke-Per, although it tells of simple people without heroic color, is an epic poem in terms of its symmetry.</p>
<p>Presiding over these poets and novelists, guiding them forward and welcoming the best of them, is Georg Brandes, a critic who has been the most knowledgeable Catholic in Europe for more than half a century. His scope of knowledge is vast; he seems to have read everything written in Europe. He wrote studies of Shakespeare, Ibsen, Anatole France, and many others. His work for future generations, his philosophy of criticism, is "Main Currents in Nineteenth-Century Literature," which has now been completely translated into English in six volumes. It is the best possible introduction to the literature of the past one hundred and fifty years. Danish readers say that his style is seductive and fluent. I can well believe this, because the English translation is also clear and fluent. His countrymen, even when they disagree with him, pay him the highest respect. He is probably the most famous critic in Europe, including all countries. I have no better way than to quote from him a section summarizing the characteristics of Danish and German literature. Brandes was not Scandinavian, but a Jew. It is appropriate to remember that he stood in a slightly objective view, seeing the Danish people. In the second volume of "Main Currents," "The German Romantic School," he said,</p>
<p>"Danish writers, seen as a whole, can be said to have the value of avoiding the tasteless and indulgent fantasies that Germans have often committed. The Danish stop in time.</p>
<p>Scene from the play "Uncle Vanya" by the Xinyou Drama Society.</p>
<p>They avoid paradoxes or fail to bring them to their logical conclusions. They have a solidity based on a natural desire to maintain balance and a natural inclination to tranquility. They have almost never become arrogant, presumptuous, revolutionary, extremely fantastic, entirely sentimental, entirely untrue, or entirely sensual. They are not very reckless, they never rush into the clouds, and they never fall into the well. This is precisely what makes them extremely familiar to their own people, and what characterizes the best works of Oehlenschläger and Hartmann... Unfailing taste and elegance will always be praised by the Danish as an expression of noble and self-controlled art... Think of Hoffman and his disciple Hans Christian Andersen, and then observe how much more healthy, calm, and gentle Andersen is than his teacher."</p>
<p>Norwegian literature and Danish literature are difficult to separate. After the political separation in the early nineteenth century, a movement arose to build an independent Norwegian literature. Many great figures of Danish literature were Norwegian. Some overly patriotic Norwegians tried hard to pull those writers back, but this is as futile as trying to decide whether Henry James and John Singer Sargent are American.</p>
<p>A later generation of romantic poets, yet all visionary poets must still be considered romantic, is Knut Hamsun. He was born in the mid-nineteenth century and lived into the twentieth. He began his adult life as a marine painter, then abandoned his paintbrush and took up the pen to describe the sea with words. He can be said to be the Danish John Masefield. His protagonists are sailors and fishermen. He became a healthy kind of patriot and became the head of the Danish theater scene by praising the life of the nation in strong poetic dramas. He made long voyages to study the appearance of the sea and the people who sailed it, thus making his content fresh, active, and true. However, knowing the sea all one's life does not necessarily mean being able to express the sea. Only those who have poetic genius not outside the ocean but inside themselves can become Conrad and Knut Hamsun.</p>
