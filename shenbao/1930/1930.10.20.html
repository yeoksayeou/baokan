<p>世界各國多因人民生活之困難而現不安之象。其間又加以政黨之竸爭。主義之紛歧。不平政治之遺留而其不安也因之愈甚。若印度若安南若埃及。類於殖民地之運動恢復國權者無論矣。即如南美自主之國。亦以革命頻聞。巴西之革命戰爭。今猶未已。西班牙之民主運動。因而有罷工風潮。德國極端黨之相爭。以國會爲戰塲。幾使政府無從措手。羅馬尼亞以新王之返國。而政局已覺不安。而近又發覺蘇聯暗探機關。被捕至一百五十人。牽涉及三大軍隊。其嚴重可知。又如新興之土耳其。自改革以後。原係一帆風順今亦以經濟困難之故。而有新政黨之出現。致有政黨之爭執。其他法治之國難無巨大之變代。而失業之救濟問題。以及政黨間之攻擊。亦足以使當國者苦心而焦慮矣。要之以今日之世界情狀而言。國際間之大戰。在近期以内。斷無發生之可能。而各國内部間之擾攘。恐一時不能即息。或將日益加甚也。</p>

<p>樂華英名、早已查騰海上、近雖健將星散、實力大損、顧其羅致之人才、亦雅有聲望、因是滬濱球迷、亟亟焉欲知今日樂華之實力、究與往年相較何如、勞神父路上、遂成閙熱之區、中華棒球場内、則見人山人海、爲數之衆、誠爲本届之破天荒也、</p>
<h3 id="c82">（二）興趣大减 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>當日樂華表演大失所望、獨李惠堂依然故我、傳遞射擊之工作、確有欣賞之價値、其餘平庸而已、全隊組織維始、個性未能互解、李寗陳虞添等又未參加、如是安能收手臂一致之效、故前鋒進取、毫無步驟、内衛防守、又見穩定九十分鐘内、受盡敵方壓迫、偶而破圍、亦難揚威異域、設無李惠堂以特殊技能、打中一球、不將全軍覆没乎、觀者至此、興趣大减矣、</p>

<p>裁判員雷泰口鳴銀笛、二隊分佈陣勢、不久劇戰開幕、先見華塞斯舉兵入侵、樂華四面對抗、卒由安原生帶領出險、李惠堂傳之以頭、楊人偉迎送中央、被迫成角、無效而退、華塞斯再度進攻、深入樂華心腹之區、顧以左翼越位、全功盡棄、其時樂華銳氣甚盛、進攻退守、聲色俱厲、轉眼之間、李惠堂以　巧傳避、予奚巧生攻打良機、惜球出力弱、被守門撲出、李又　活潑身段、縱横於左邊區域内、出人不意、挑送門前、守門内衛、返身不及、球門大開、奚巧生移步前進、迎之以頭、碰然一聲、越門而過、觀衆懊傷之餘、唯有苦笑而已、</p>
<h3 id="c85">（五）厥功甚偉 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>樂華幾次進擊、未中敵人要害、前鋒銳氣、損失殆盡、所幸後衛防守、尚能盡職、陸鐘恩以孤獨之身、擋敵軍之衝、倒地救球、竟而成功、厥功甚偉、餘危未已、敵又自左侵入、向門猛射、陸舉單掌擒之、再度出險、乃敵人又平地射來一球、爲勢甚急、陸俯身擋之、又告平安、</p>
<h3 id="c86">（六）大傷元氣 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>二十分鐘後、樂華抵抗力量、漸不如前、最大隱危、厥爲内部凌亂、或散或聚、悉無程秩、其時一球自左來、兩内衛舉止失措、各以身阻左右内鋒之進衝、陸鐘恩乘機前出奪球、忽相衝落地、右内鋒許爾加上一脚、打入門中、二分鐘内、右翼買列台高挑一球、巨風挾球、空中亂轉、内衛莫知所從、中鋒勃特又射入一球、樂華連失二球、大爲奮怒、奚巧生又得機打門、被守門接住、崔楊猛衝之、守門倒地、但仍堅握不放、卒賴强硬之軀、奪圍出險、而華塞斯前鋒、又長驅直入、連近二次角球、第二次之結果、中鋒勃特又打入網内、至時華塞斯已勝三球、樂華則一無所有、</p>
<h3 id="c87">（七）快人快舉 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>樂華旣失之桑愉、勢將收之東隅、下半時起、樂華更動陣線、如前表所列、一時華塞斯日迷五色、形勢稍亂、李惠堂奇兵突出、與奚巧生相輔而進、時機一至、立即攻門、勢峻力强、守門擋之不住、依然獨旁柱進門、一球旣中、士氣大振、十分鐘之後、樂華再逢良機、李楊均近迫敵門、惜互相阻礙、難於發脚、否則又有驚人之舉也、</p>
<h3 id="c88">（八）一盤散沙 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>從此華塞斯之活動、突見增躍、前軍節節勝利、勢如破竹、樂華内部如一盤散沙、不可收拾、最後十分鐘内、又連失二球、一爲中鋒射入、一由左内鋒打中、後之一身、淸楚美麗、至足贊賞、大戰閉幕、華塞斯以五對一得勝、</p>

<p>嶺南足球隊在中華足球會中字組中、亦堪稱强旅之一、昨日下午三時、在中華足球塲、與寳塔中作字組比賽、裁判員唐仲光、</p>
<p>嶺南内堅外銳、勢占上風、陳洪光首開紀錄、梁敏發繼之、獲中第二球、寳塔在失勢之下、不絶猛進、顧以對方陣線整齊、往往不利而退、上半時寳塔遂以零比二失利、</p>
<p>再戰聲中、嶺南經騐宏、早探知對方弱點所在、乘、勢進取、莫不如願以償、寳塔分守要隘、努力抵抗、輙以實力欠强、顧此失彼、不久、陳洪光奪得第三球、卓國榮又加上一球、接後、陳再獲一球、寳塔旣負五球、怒氣冲冠、前鋒線如潮擁進、嶺南一時不愼、自行踢入一球、但爲時無幾、梁敏發再施身手、又中一球、寳塔在反攻聲中、得十二碼罰球機會、雖未直接射中、然王章寳亦因次而奪回一球、造成二對六之結果、勝利歸諸嶺南、</p>

<p>田徑賽　本届運動會中、著名選手、均未參加、蓋予新進健兒以奪標之機會、用意至善、故比賽結果、雖未能創造特殊之紀錄、但參加人數之衆多、比賽精神之飽滿、亦爲不可廢滅之成績、惜下午四百米决賽、關長發跑至中途、突然斜至外圈、有阻碍後一人向前之事實、經檢察長報告總裁判、將其成績取消、考之手續、毫無不合之處孰料關長發係白虹隊隊員、同隊十餘人、一時意氣用事、想率退出運動會、甚至終點裁判長宋澤安、亦因白虹隊員關係、同時離場、實爲美中平足之事、茲錄各項比賽成績如次、</p>

<p>自由談付之一笑  海客　　甲（問他東鄰的某乙）—先生。你那狗怎麽樣。　　乙—我已依了你的話去掉了。　　甲—這樣再好没有。從此以後。我夜間便可好好安睡。不再被那狗吠的聲音閙醒了。伹你怎樣去掉的。可没有將它殺死麽。　　乙—没有没有。我賣給了你那西隔壁的丙先生。得了十塊錢的代價。　　餐客（向待者）—我不能吃這湯。侍者去換了一盆來。　　餐客—我不能吃這湯。　　侍者含着怒。又去換了一盆來。　　餐客—我不能吃這湯。　　侍者（勃然大怒）—這是甚麽一回事。我給你連換了三次。你還是說不能吃。　　餐客（靜靜的作答）—因爲没有湯匙。　　妻—你怎麽敢和我閙起來。平日間你不是常說我是一家的女王。而你是小臣麽。　　夫—是的。但那女王要是專制過度。不許那小臣抽板烟。不許那小臣喝黄酒。夜間又不許那小臣出去。那麽小臣因感到苛政如虎。不得不想及共和政體之福。而作革命的運動了。旅途雜掇  習哉　　到靑島以後　靑島爲北方大海港之一。隸膠州。昔僅爲一濱海小漁村。自經德人租借後。竭力經營。不遺餘力。乃大改舊觀。風景秀麗。不亞香港。此次愚得觀光機會。厥有數事可目爲特别者。爲記之於左。（一）靑島市街作波浪起伏形。（或曰蛇行式）自街之此端至街之中央。儼如一自下而上之斜坡。自街之中央至街之彼端迤邐而下。亦爲斜坡形。人力車行其上。必緩緩徐行。如船夫拉　狀。其下坡也則如圓丸走坂。迅捷異常。蓋上下之勢異也。此項街道之優點。爲終年乾燥。雖霖雨兼旬。亦不稍瀦水潦。所有靑市數十街道俱作此式。或疑爲天然形式。殊不然也。　　（二）爲靑市之洋式住房。依山傍水。建築偉麗。形式美觀。或具田園風。或爲宮殿式。或則𢌞廊曲折。或則高閣臨空。爲增靑市之美觀不少。（三）爲海水浴塲。在市梢。板屋櫛比。海波蕩漾。西人至此避暑者。於向晚夕陽西下之際。爭蒞海水浴塲、爲鳧水之戲。紅男綠女。煞是可觀（四）爲砲台。昔隸德國勢力範圍内。秘密建築砲台於靑市之匯泉岬。周圍有警戒線。數里以内。不許吾國人徘徊。故靑市亦有此砲台埀二十年。而國人猶夢夢不知也。及歐戰以後、靑島交還。各國人士始得相率至是間一觀德國人之偉大工事。愚此次亦往一度參觀。於山巔置有大砲十數尊。均隱藏於山石或樹蔭之後。最大之口俓。達尺餘。底承以轉盤。可以隨意𢌞旋。其頂係鐵製。儼如一土饅頭式。砲台之下即係德國兵營。掘在山腰内。内隧道入。深達里許。内有貯藏室·彈藥室·軍醫室·治療室·等。如蜂房又如蟻穴。穩固隱密。兼而有之。吾人由山北之隧道入。至山南之隧道出。約行可二十分鐘。而在外間觀之。絲毫不露形迹也。曾見廚室内尚有牛肉一鍋。聞係日德戰爭時。德人所遺棄。日人故保存之以爲誇耀者也。（五）棧橋在海濱。長達兩里。伸臂入海中。工程頗不小。（六）靑市之警察派出所。俱係小巧精緻之洋房。蓋爲全國所望塵莫及。（七）愚所寓之東道主爲神州藥房張氏昆仲。神州藥房爲吾國最大之製藥公司。所有各項有名製劑。均係張氏昆仲所自行研究製成。蓋張氏昆仲畢業於國内軍醫學校後。尚至日本帝大藥科。研究多年。故有此成績也。變態心理  徐雍　　慈母洗滌子女的排泄物。從没有嫌惡的心理。可是父母老了。病倒牀上。尿屙不能自主的時候。做子女的那箇願親去動手。這是甚麽心理。　　花用整千整百的洋鈿。一些兒没有喊聲寃枉。可是劃一根火柴。似乎非常肉痛。要打算盤。這是甚麽心理。　　賭來十元百元。似乎没有甚麽希罕。可是從投稿得着了一元兩元。非常開心。這是甚麽心理。　　有了二三百萬傢當。朋友借他五元十元。從不答應。而情情願願來做跑馬廳孝子。這是甚麽心理。　　自已美貌的妻子。溫存體貼。有時還要反目口角。偏偏碰着路上女子。給伊駡了一頓。翻覺非常窩心。這是甚麽心理。　　從闊人家裏出來。口口聲聲對人說起。從當舖裏出來。閉口無言。這是甚麽心理。秋聲零楮錄  海秋　　認頭一段。在審頭刺湯劇中頗關重要。表演者做作特繁。稍一不當。即失其精采。减小觀者之興趣。葺昌君謂必須經過下列幾種程序如態度。茲略述之。（一）見頭。驚訝兼恐怖的態度。因雪艶乃一弱女子。忽見此多數可怖之人頭。不能不有所驚恐也。（二）認頭。憂愁有難色的態度。丹　人頭太多。形極糢糊。不易認識淸楚。演者於此必須將頭上下左右微搖。目光則注視於人頭。以表示觀察之周到。（三）抱頭。恐怖兼趦趄的態度。人頭乃最骯髒駭人之物。抱非所願。故此畏首畏尾。但距人頭不遠時。手足宜敏捷。以示其决心也。（四）擲頭。驚駭的態度。一知其錯誤。二嫌其可怖而汚穢。但擲時宜輕快。（五）再認。駭極而戰慄的態度。（六）再抱。敏捷的態度。受了以上種種剌激。神志專定。認辨分明。故毅然不懼。而逕前抱取。（七）哭頭。悲哀悽慘。上列七種。必須繼續演下。不容稍微間斷。此塲做作難工。現在演者均不免。此是彼非。以予所見。以程艶秋爲佳。因其態度身段靈巧敏活也。至其嗓音幽秀。腔調曲折。剌湯一段二黄。尤有宛轉哀鳴如泣如訴之妙緒。歎觀止矣。　　艶秋對於籌振遼西水災。異常熱心。在北平致函遼災急振會。送交振欵欵二千元。茲錄原函復函如左。遼災急振會公鑒。遼西各縣洪水成災。澤國哀鴻。聞之慘惻。艶秋南行在即。愧無裨補。用特捐洋二千元。略效棉薄。敬乞收轉災區爲荷。順頌公綏。程艶秋敬啓。（九月二十九日）敬復者。接奉大函。並捐振遼西水災銀二千元。敬承收到。仁施義助。欽篆不勝、謹代綏錦等縣數十萬災黎九頓以謝。此復程玉霜先生。北平籌募遼省水災急振會啓。（十月一日）記義犬  憶秋　　無錫無敵牌牙粉廠。位於惠商橋北。主其事者。爲天虚我生之介弟蓉軒先生。廠中蓄一犬。體頗巨。全身黑色。活潑如獮猴。刁滑如頑童。鞋襪雜物。常被啣之外出。或爲遷動方向。先生頗惡之。擯之門外。則狺吠竟夜。聆之。似哀懇者然。棄之他處。不久自返。返後必擺尾長跪於先生前。似表示懺悔。然移時即故態復萌。先生實厭恨甚矣。上月其日。先生雇划船一。縛犬登舟。命舟子駛往百里外棄之。翌日。舟子返。謂已棄於相隔百二十里之某鄕。且距此旱途不通。河流相阻、萬全之法也。先生稱之。賞以銀餅二枚。詎於舟子返錫之翌日。犬亦至。至則伏地不動。喘息不已。狀至困　堪憐。先生與其夫人均異之。知係義犬。因留之云。一指禪  翠羽　　推拿一道。由來舊矣。其術始太古黄帝。號一指禪。内經云。病生於不仁。治之以按摩。班氏藝文誌。載黄帝按摩經十卷。惜其書已失。後漢華陀來五禽之戲。熊經鳥申之術。魏文有六鎚之鍜。習之可以延書蓋即今之推拿也。明季有推拿醫家周于蕃者。精是術。負盛名一時。惜周吝其法不傳。於是此術遂墨。邇來海上以推拿術問世者。頗不乏人。顧眞能得其竅奥者實尠。摯友陳君。月前頸間忽隱隱作痛。翌日。發現一　生物。始如豆大。不數日。已暴漲如拳。陳君惶恐。遍請四醫診治。或云血瘤。或言經炎。而其患處。適當血管。割治時恐血流不止。故皆束手。陳益惶急。而傍徨無計。後得友人之介。聘西藏路平樂里推拿醫家朱春霆君診治。數日後即漸收小。未及兼旬。　生物竟消失於無形。一指之禪。可謂神矣。意大利美術考察記（六）  汪亞塵　　這瑪爾谷敎堂。因古蹟甚多。現在已改爲美術館。從羅馬運來的破磚殘石。陳列滿園。都是歷史上的遺物。宗敎壁畫。以此堂爲最多。　　綜觀許多壁畫。其題材都偏於宗敎方面。在一　敎徒看到這種題材。確是津津有味。在我們非敎徒看來。只能看到畫風的變遷罷了。　　（七）羅杭蜀Lorenzo敎堂　此敎堂亦爲佛羅稜司著名建築之一。範圍極廣。共分三處。後方即梅達依契Meddcea之家廟。昔日米葛朗極羅。經營此墓之雕刻。煞費苦心。其名作（黄昏）即在其内。　　羅杭蜀正廳。高數十丈。四周皆以五彩大理石嵌成各種圖案。是一八二八年大建築家Fenvenutl所經營。四周安置墳墓十餘具。宏大嚴肅。可稱觀止。　　佛羅稜司。在十五世紀做了世界文化的中心。在藝術尤爲光榮。當時有許多貴族。他們建造宏壯的殿邸。梅達依契的家廟。亦即其中之一。在當時又爲了政局不寗。生命之危安。朝不知夕。故其建築極美其内部。外觀往往樸素。外觀簡單而入内華屬驚人的那種格式。就名爲佛羅稜司派。這種建築。現在還大部分存留着。上面所述佛羅稜司的藝術。不過取其重要者簡而記之。在藝術遍地的羅稜司。尚有許多歷史上的藝術品。因本文寫得太長。只得從略。心上温馨（二九八）  包天笑　　第十回　翠竹淚斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離　　太太想他不接下文。倒有點可惡。但是他不能始終裝唖吧。又說道。搬回了家以後。免得老爺大公館小公館兩處的奔波。雖然不用他自已的脚跑。有車子給他代步。可是工夫也要的。從家裏到號裏。再從號裏出來到小公館裏。在路上也要耽擱不少的工夫。只怕從號裏到小公館裏。比子從家裏到號裏還要遠一點吧。殷太太靠着冒功。已經冒出了根生的話。知道從大太太的話裏。已經有了二太太。只不過没有三太太。可見老爺有小公館是確切不移的了。雖是告訴根生。說老爺已經告訴了我。但有看他的神氣。還有點將信將疑。不大肯說。所以問他傢生多不多。他不接下文。但他究竟也不說没有小房子。没有傢生的話。現在我所最要知道的。就是那個小公館。究竟借在那裏。但又不便直接的問他。一問了他。他便要想。老爺旣然都告訴了伊。怎麽小公館的地址。不告訴伊呢。那末老爺都告訴伊的那句話。是靠不住的了。所以伊不問得。却只是遠兜轉的說。根生聽得太太說。從號裏到小公館。比了從大公館到號裏還要遠。他又不服氣了。他說不。路也差不多。太太怎麽差不多呢。老爺說比家裏到號裏遠呢。你走慣了。便不覺得遠咧。根生道。其實没有這們遠。從號裏出來。從北京路望西。到白克路轉灣。不就到了嗎。太太想好了。這已經有一個大概了。再問下去。不但是他露出馬脚。我也要露出馬脚來了。原來太太那裏。還有一位參謀。你道這位參謀是誰。却就是他們那位大少爺。大少爺是這位太太所出。自然傾向他母親。但父親和母親。至少是平等的。何以這位大少爺。却傾向他的母親。這裏頭也有個小小原因。從來說嚴父慈母。父親總是比較嚴一點。母親總是比較慈一點。那位殷老爺。雖然是好說。家裏當地是一個阿彌陀佛看待。可是他對於少爺。却有一點兒嚴。别的倒也不去管他。就在這用錢上面。却不許多支。帳房裏有一定限制。多支了他就要嚕囌。那位殷太太呢。却有些相反。家裏人誰也不當伊一個閻王老婆看待。雌老虎又是呌出了名的。可是對於伊的少爺。却有一點兒慈。就是在賬房裏領不到錢的時候。向母他親去設法。多少總可以拿到一點。</p>

<p>(Beiping) Feng's subordinates Lu Zhonglin, Liu Yufen, Song Zheyuan, Sun Lianzhong, Sun Dianying, Pang Bingxun, Liu Ruming, Ma Hongbin, Zheng Dazhang, Liu Ji, and others have sent a telegram, dispatched from Taiyuan to Jiaozuo. The draft was prepared by various talents, concerning the handling of military aftermath, and awaiting the central government's measures. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">After the Meeting of Yan and Feng <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Recognizing There is No Way to Salvage the Situation</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jin telegram: After Yan and Feng met, they recognized that there was no way to salvage the situation. Not resigning would be disallowed by the times, but resigning would be something they are unwilling to do. They have decided to hand over military power to their subordinates. If the situation is really bad, they will consider going abroad. It is said that going abroad will be done in two steps. If Tianjin and Beiping can be safe, they will leave from Tianjin to Japan. Otherwise, they will go to Europe via Mongolia, Russia, and Siberia. A decision has not yet been made. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan issued 40,000 yuan of Shanxi currency to dismiss the Kuang Hui (Expansion Conference) and the military representative groups. In Taiyuan, the market price of Shanxi currency is 3 jiao and 2 fen per yuan. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) From a news agency: Yan recently telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, saying that he would follow all of Zhang’s suggestions regarding the aftermath. He is preparing to go abroad. He only hopes that Suiyuan can act as a buffer so that his troops can be settled. Zhang replied that he needs to seek instructions from the Central Government. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Various Shanxi currency exchanges in Beiping and Tianjin jointly telegraphed Zhao Daiwen, requesting him to persuade Yan to go abroad quickly, so that his subordinates can abandon disobedience and show obedience, and that Shanxi would not suffer from the calamities of war twice. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Jiayou has arrived in Tianjin from Taiyuan. Pan Yunchao and Jing Hengyi arrived in Beiping yesterday and will go abroad with Wang Renzhi soon. (19th)</p>

<p>Guo's Troops Have Advanced to Shunde</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Northeast Cavalry Brigade, led by Bai Fengxiang, arrived in Zhengding and Shijiazhuang on the 18th. Another cavalry brigade, led by Guo Xipeng, has advanced to Shunde. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan handed over his troops to Shang Zhen, because he thought Shang was a Hebei native and would be difficult to control in the future. He hopes that Xu Yongchang will be the nominal commander, while he can still indirectly control them. Yan telegraphed the Northeast, requesting to hand them over to Xu Yongchang. Yan also ordered the Shanxi troops on the Ping-Sui Railway to prepare to retreat to the inside of Yanmen Pass. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Shenyang said that Zhang Xueliang has decided to eliminate the remnants of Yan and Feng's troops in a short period. Now he is dividing his troops into two routes to pursue them in the northwest. One route is leaving from Nankou, and the other is leaving from Shijiazhuang. (19th)</p>

<p>Rong Zhen is Going to Beiping to Prepare for Setting Up the Headquarters</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Shenyang: Zhang Xueliang has scheduled to hold the second meeting of senior cadres on the 20th. The three deputy commanders of Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe (Jehol) - Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, and Tang Yulin - and other important figures must attend to discuss: 1. The two armies entering the customs are stationed in Beiping and Tianjin, and also administer the Chahar and Suiyuan areas. The allocation is insufficient, and three or four armies should be added. Each army should have four brigades. It is proposed that Hu Yukun be the commander of the Third Army and Tang Yulin be the commander of the Fourth Army. Once approved, they will be announced. 2. Immediately issue a telegram advising Yan and Feng to go abroad. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang will come to Beiping to inspect soon. The head of the military police, Fu Rui, will lead his troops to Beiping first. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Xueliang dispatched Rong Zhen, the director of the Military Affairs Department, to Tianjin by train on the evening of the 19th to go to Beiping to prepare for the establishment of the headquarters of the Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and to discuss military affairs with Yu Xuezhong. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Shi Yousan Asks for Any Territory in Chahar and Suiyuan <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Shi Yousan again asked Han Fuqu to implore the Central Government to give him a province in Chahar and Suiyuan to station troops. Shi currently has 60,000 subordinates, but the actual number is less. He is currently recruiting locally. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shi Yousan has completely ceded the defense area of Xinxiang to Lu Zhonglin's troops to garrison. Shi's troops are now stationed from south of Lincheng to Weihui and Qixian. The county magistrates are now appointed by Shi to implement fundraising. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Someone stationed in Beiping by Shi said that Shi has accepted the Central Government's appointment as the commander of the 13th Route Army, but his five armies, with Sun Guangqian, Shen Mian, Mi Yunhe, Su Mingqi, and Yuan Dehuai as division commanders, and a total of 50,000 to 60,000 troops, are relying on northern Henan for food. Henan does not have this capacity. If they are moved to Hebei, the Northeast does not need this guest either. An important figure in the Northeast said that Shi should not have recruited so many troops in the first place, and now he feels the trouble of having too many soldiers. The Party suggests asking Shi to find food in Shanxi, because Shi was ordered by Yan to be the commander of the Fourth Front Army, so he should ask Yan for funding. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military News: Shi Yousan's troops are currently stationed in the areas of Zhangde and Tangyin and have been ordered to be under the command of Deputy Commander Zhang. The troops of Xu Yongchang and Pang Bingxun are retreating to southern Shanxi. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin convened a military conference at the Zhengzhou headquarters on the 18th. Xu Yuanquan, Hao Menglin, Liu Zhi, He Guoguang, and others were present to discuss military operations for attacking west of Luoyang. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military News: The vanguard of Yang Hucheng's army has reached the vicinity of Tongguan and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy's outposts. Zheng Dazhang's troops near Fengqiu have been completely disarmed. There are no enemy troops on Yang's army's front, and Zhangguan can be recovered soon. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

They went to the headquarters to meet with Commander-in-Chief Jiang, and reported that most of the Northwest Army was willing to sincerely obey the Central Government. Jiang was very pleased and intended to give Sun the title of Commander-in-Chief to maintain the status quo of his troops. The troops currently have four divisions: Gao Shuxun, Dong Zhentang, Zhang Zizhong, and Li Songkun, currently stationed in Jiaozuo and Xinxiang. Jiang intends to designate western Shandong as the garrison area for the troops. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Political Program of the Chinese Nationalist Party <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Nationalist Party leads the national revolution to seek freedom and equality for China.</p>
<p>The nationalism of the Nationalist Party has two aspects: first, the Chinese nation seeks its own liberation; second, all ethnic groups within China are equal.</p>
<p>In addition to indirect democracy, the Nationalist Party's power advocates direct democracy (the rights of initiative, referendum, recall, and impeachment).</p>
<p>The most important principles of the Nationalist Party's livelihood principle are nothing more than two: one is (equal land rights) and the other is (regulation of capital).</p>
<p>The first point of the foreign policy is that China recognizes as the most favored nation any country that voluntarily renounces all privileges and is willing to abolish treaties that undermine China's sovereignty.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the national funeral of the late President Tan, it is heard that after discussion by various committee members, it was said that since the late President Tan served as the chairman of the National Government when the capital was established in Nanjing, it can be compared to the ceremonial tributes for retired heads of state who have made meritorious contributions to the country after their deaths. The standard will be used as the benchmark, and subsequent tomb construction and all funeral arrangements, as well as funeral expenses, will be handled based on this standard. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang sent a representative to pay respects to the late President Tan. The eulogy is as follows: "On October 19th of the 19th year of the Republic of China, Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and Commander of the Northeast Border Defense, respectfully presents offerings of livestock, wine, and delicacies to announce to the spirit of Tan Yankai, Chairman of the Executive Yuan of the National Government. I respectfully say that you, sir, are an outstanding hero of your time. Born and raised in Hunan, you were an early member of the literary world. You held military command and acted with thunderous speed. In the Northern Expedition, you swept away the evil forces. When the world was chaotic and China was fragmented, and our country was being oppressed, you raised the banner of righteousness and destroyed the tyrannical regime. Your prestige shook the land, and you were like thunder and lightning. Although you controlled Hunan and Hubei, you lost Jiangsu and Zhejiang. You borrowed from the city and your spirit was resolute. Heaven sent disaster to China, and the mountains and rivers split apart. You cherished the restoration of Chu, held the bamboo tally of Cangwu. You opened up a new era in ten years, with a heart full of passion. You held two mouths of the mountains and rivers, and the golden soup was stolen by thieves. The atmosphere of invasion was disturbing, but you were determined to purify it. You returned to your homeland, and the people rejoiced. Like Yu received Yao's investiture, the golden city and jade tower. But alas, one illness silenced you forever, and you are lonely in the underworld, a thousand years of sadness. Alas, Xueliang is ignorant and incompetent, from the remote Changbai Mountains, my spirit is buried. I vow to pacify the wilderness, and dare to disregard any failure. From the dragon river in the north to the Yue territory, I was both grieved and happy. I was unable to cure you, and my heart was even more saddened. I dared not rest because of the affairs of the state, but now you have left forever. It is sad, a disaster for the country, and heroes are taken away. I wish to carry on your will and support the sun and moon. Fortunately, my comrades-in-arms have cut off the heads of the rebels. I will stabilize the Central Plains to tell the previous sages. From ten thousand miles away, I send a heart of incense and a cup of offering. I hope your spirit accepts it. I sigh with the wind, Alas! May you enjoy it!" (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Many countries around the world are exhibiting signs of unrest due to the difficulties in the lives of their people. Adding to this are the competitions between political parties, the divergence of ideologies, and the legacies of unjust politics, which further exacerbate the unrest. The movements in India, Annam (Vietnam), and Egypt, and other colonies to restore national rights are not to be mentioned. Even in the autonomous countries of South America, revolutions are frequently heard. The revolutionary war in Brazil is still ongoing. The democratic movement in Spain has led to labor strikes. The extreme parties in Germany are competing with each other, using the parliament as a battlefield, almost making it impossible for the government to take action. The return of the new king to Romania has already made the political situation feel uneasy. Recently, a Soviet intelligence agency was discovered, and 150 people were arrested, involving the three major armed forces. The seriousness of this situation is evident. Furthermore, in the newly emerging Turkey, after the reforms, everything was originally smooth sailing, but now, due to economic difficulties, a new political party has emerged, leading to disputes between political parties. Other countries with the rule of law, even without major changes, are facing issues such as unemployment relief and attacks between political parties, which are enough to cause those in power to worry and be anxious. In summary, in today's world situation, a major international war is unlikely to occur in the near future, but the internal disturbances of various countries may not subside immediately and may even intensify.</p>

<p>France Has Ambitious Designs to Dominate All of Europe</p>
<p>The Future of Military Reduction is Pessimistic</p>
<p>Paris Dispatch: The League of Nations Disarmament Preparatory Commission is about to convene. However, amidst this clamor for disarmament, if one observes the actual state of military preparations in various European countries, deep doubts arise. It seems that every nation, using its own national defense needs as an excuse, is actively expanding its military. However, since each country claims it is for defensive purposes, it remains unknown which nation will be the aggressor. In Southern Europe, from the Riviera to the Alps along the Swiss border, French and Italian troops confront each other as if facing a major enemy. In Northern Europe, ever since Germany advocated for the revision of national borders, Poland has been building extensive defensive fortifications along its frontier, as if a German invasion is imminent. It is said that if Poland continues to expand its military, financial support will likely come from France. The Franco-German reconciliation that Briand has been striving for for years will become even more unattainable. Both France and Poland attribute this tense situation to the rise of extremist forces in Germany, such as the National Socialist Party. Germany's response is that France has ambitious designs to dominate all of Europe by political means. Italy echoes this to counter France, deeply fearing that if France gains influence in the Balkan countries, Italy will be isolated and helpless. Moreover, Mussolini's recent execution of several Slavic youths in Trieste has caused great resentment in Yugoslavia towards Italy, making the situation even more urgent. As for Eastern Europe, Hungary complains every day about the unfairness of the Treaty of Trianon and seeks to recover the lands ceded to Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. On the European continent, Hungary's voice seems very faint, but across the English Channel in Great Britain, there are many who sympathize with Hungary. The future of peace in Eastern Europe will largely depend on whether the former Austrian Archduke can return to the throne. The Hungarian people seem to welcome his restoration, but Romania has repeatedly stated that it will never allow the development of Hungary's internal affairs to affect the provisions of the treaty, which is tantamount to saying that any discussion of revising the treaty is out of the question. Italy's Mussolini, dissatisfied with Yugoslavia, is very keen to win over Hungary to counter the French faction. Germany, as an old friend of Hungary, may also re-establish ties. In short, the political relationships throughout Europe are complex and interwoven, dazzling to the eye. The mutual suspicion can be seen in the efforts of various countries to vigorously strengthen their military. Briand's League of Nations seems destined to remain a mere ideal. (World)</p>

<p>Law to Sign Loan Contract Passes Third Reading</p>
<p>Motion of No Confidence in the Cabinet Automatically Dismissed</p>
<p>Parliament Adjourns Until December</p>
<p>Extremist Factions Clash Again</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 18th: Today's final debate on the government's declaration in Parliament was again tumultuous. National Socialist Party members remained the mainstay of the disruption, at one point nearly resorting to fists. Fortunately, Speaker Löbe and others were skilled at handling the situation, and the atmosphere gradually calmed down in the evening. None of the government ministers responded throughout the day. When the debate reached around 9 p.m., the government party's motion that Parliament should immediately engage in internal affairs and temporarily adjourn until early December to give the government sufficient time to formulate various bills for financial reform gradually gained momentum. In a vote at 11 p.m., the government won by 318 votes to 236. With the passage of this motion, all thirteen motions of no confidence in the cabinet and various ministers were automatically dismissed. In addition, the government was victorious on issues such as the government's financial reform plan and the proposal to refer the National Socialist Party's motion to abolish the Young Plan to a special committee for review. Furthermore, the third reading of the 500 million mark loan was passed by 325 votes to 237 before the government party's adjournment motion was passed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 19th: Yesterday, when the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party gathered in Parliament, they intended to use Parliament as a battleground, resulting in several members being expelled from the chamber. One National Socialist Party member declared that if a certain Social Democratic Party speaker returned to Munich, he would definitely kill him. The opposition party put forward more than ten motions of no confidence, while those supporting the government wanted to dismiss them. In the vote, the government won a victory of 318 votes to 236. When the results were announced, the supporters cheered loudly, while the opposition booed. The Communist Party sang the Internationale, and the National Socialist Party shouted the slogan "Germany Awake." Another dispatch stated that Parliament passed an amnesty law by 395 votes to 147, including many people who committed political assassinations. Parliament then adjourned until December 13.</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 18th: Today's stock market situation remained stable throughout the day. The people's trust in the political situation and finance, and their hope for early stability, were clearly strengthened. In addition, the salary reduction movement is spreading, and labor unrest is expected not to escalate. The public now recognizes that even if radical parties debate in Parliament, they can still fulfill the promises they made during the election campaign, and the moderate elements within the Social Democratic Party have also persuaded the left-leaning members of their party to make sacrifices to help the government and avoid a major political, financial, and economic crisis. Therefore, the current situation is very different from a few days ago.</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 18th: The Parliament's Rules Committee today passed a resolution recommending to Parliament to temporarily reduce the salaries of members by 20% and special allowances by 50%, pending a final decision. It is expected that this proposal will be passed by the general assembly.</p>
<p>Pacific News, Berlin, 18th: Conflicts between the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party resulted in eight Communist Party members being injured.

<h3 id="e46">Train Revolution <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>100-Foot-Long Train Propelled by 400 Horsepower</p>
<p>Speed of 182 Kilometers Per Hour</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 18th: A new type of train was tested near Hanover today. The train is 100 feet long, shaped between a Zeppelin airship and a modern road vehicle. It has a thruster at the rear, powered by a 400-horsepower engine. Today's test run was on a shorter and more winding track, so the maximum speed was only 182 kilometers per hour. It is expected that if it travels in a straight line, this rate can be doubled. However, even at this speed, all the metal parts in the train were ringing, and the forty or so passengers and experts felt slightly dizzy. According to the inventor, this train can be called a revolution in all rail vehicles. Next time, a longer railway line will be selected for testing, and it is planned to use a turbine engine to save fuel.</p>

<p>Reuters, Geneva, 19th: The secretary of the League of Nations Central Opium Bureau prepared a report and submitted it to the Administrative Council, calling attention to the increase in the manufacture of morphine and cocaine in Turkey, stating that the recent seizures in Hong Kong clearly came from Turkey. It also stated that the lack of statistics submitted by South and Central America to the League is deeply regrettable, as South America is a concentration point for the production of coca leaves. The implementation of the Opium Convention has affected the sale of drugs worldwide. Twelve tons of morphine salts manufactured in 1929 were not available for illegal trade, but this danger has now been greatly reduced, because except for France, all manufacturing countries are now using the Geneva Convention to control this substance. The report requested the Administrative Council to forward the rules for supplying statistics on confiscated drugs to the French government. It also stated that the amount of morphine consumed per person in France and Japan is more than four times higher than in any other country that reports its consumption figures to the Central Opium Bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Sun Lianzhong Sends Representative to Shandong <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>To Request Han Fuju to Plead Loyalty to the Central Government on His Behalf</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Central Plains War and the disintegration of the Northwest Army have now reached a stage of political resolution. All Northwest Army personnel who have surrendered have been appointed to various positions, while the majority of Feng's army who retreated to Hebei have been reporting their willingness to surrender and be incorporated into the national army in recent days. Yesterday (the 16th), Li Han-hui, the chief of staff of Sun Lianzhong, an important general of the Northwest Army, arrived in Jinan from Xinxiang on behalf of Sun Lianzhong to report the situation at the front to Han Fuju and Jiang Bocheng and request them to plead loyalty to the Central Government on his behalf. Han and Jiang immediately telegraphed the Central Government to request instructions. In his telegram, Han strongly stated that he had worked with Sun Lianzhong for many years in the Northwest Army and knew him very well. This surrender is sincere and he guaranteed that Sun would never go back on his word. Today, a reply telegram was received from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, ordering Jiang Bocheng to go to Nanjing with Sun's representative for face-to-face consultations to avoid repeated telegram exchanges. After receiving the telegram, Jiang and Han agreed with Li Han-hui and decided to take the Jinpu train to Nanjing tomorrow morning. It is said that Han told Jiang Bocheng that Sun Lianzhong (Sun Lianzhong's given name) is a fellow villager and colleague and knows him to be honest and reliable. He urged Jiang to plead with the Commander-in-Chief for extra understanding. All other issues will be subject to the orders of the Central Government. However, regarding the issue of garrisoning, he can obey orders to go to any place north of the Yangtze River. If he is transferred to the south of the Yangtze River, Sun's basic forces can also obey, but he is afraid that the newly attached forces cannot be commanded as desired. This is Sun's unavoidable predicament. The reporter visited Mr. Li Han-hui today and asked about the recent situation of the Northwest Army. According to Li, Sun's headquarters has a total of four divisions. There was no major loss in this retreat. Sun and his three men are currently stationed in Xinxiang, and the troops are stationed in Xinxiang and along the Daokou-Qinghua Railway. The remaining Northwest Army personnel who retreated to the north of the Yellow River include the units of Liu Chunrong, Sun Liangcheng, Liu Guitang, Sun Dianying, and Zheng Dazhang. Each unit has suffered considerable losses, but Sun Liangcheng's unit has only a pistol brigade left after Ji Hongchang and Liang Kouying defected. Feng Yuxiang, seeing that the general trend was over, left Xinxiang's Nanxiaoji Town on the 9th with four or five followers and went west. Before I came to Jinan, I did not know his whereabouts. Lu Zhonglin has also voluntarily stepped down. Sun Liangcheng has also decided to step down due to the huge losses. All the above-mentioned troops are under the command of Sun Lianzhong. Since Sun's headquarters has no way out and the troops under his command still have more than 20,000 people, he sent me to Jinan to ask Chairman Han to plead with the Central Government for surrender in order to end the responsibility and end the war as soon as possible. As for the units of Song Zheyuan and Liu Yufen, they have retreated to Shaanxi. (October 17)</p>
<h3 id="e53">He Jinbiao and Lu Xingming Captured <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>He Has Been Executed and Lu Will Be Sent to the Province</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Liu Zongyi of the First Provincial Police Brigade recaptured Songzheng yesterday. He Jinbiao, the chief bandit of the Lu army who had surrendered, seeing that Lu's troops were collapsing, went from Zhenghe to Yanping to see Lu Xingbang, intending to rush to the Zhejiang border to command his troops and take the road through Zhenghe to collect the remnants. It happened that his former subordinate Ye Songsheng heard about it and brought guards to watch at the location He had to pass through. On the 9th, He and his eight guards were intercepted and reported to Liu Zongyi, who telegraphed the province for instructions. The provincial government telegraphed back ordering him to send He to the province for interrogation. Liu had already escorted He to Sandu on the 11th. However, the provincial government then considered that He had harassed the Fuzhou Ningfu area for a long time and had now been captured alive and should be shot immediately. It specifically telegraphed Jin Zhenzhong, the brigade commander of the Marine Corps stationed in Sandu, to execute He on the spot. Jin obeyed the order and shot He on the 13th and reported it to the province.</p>
<p>After the June 1st coup, Lu and Ming went to Shanghai to show that they had not joined the coup and remained as a last resort for a turnaround. Recently, Lu Xingming, seeing that Lu Xingbang and Lu Xingrong had telegraphed their resignation, went from Shanghai to Zhejiang and returned to Yanping to consult with Lu's generals in order to seek peace through the mediation of Sun Benrong. However, as soon as he arrived in Jiangshan County, Zhejiang, he was intercepted by the troops of He Wang, the general of the Yan Jian Shao Civil Corps appointed by Zhang Zhen, the commander of the newly organized First Division. He was temporarily detained by the Jiangshan Public Security Bureau. He had already telegraphed the province for a report yesterday. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government ordered him to send Lu to the province for handling as soon as possible. (October 15)</p>

<p>Liu Heding and the Party Department Advocate Rejection</p>
<p>Fang Shengtao Advocates Both Suppression and Pacification</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Lu Xingbang recently sent a telegram to the province requesting surrender due to repeated defeats. The telegram arrived in the province on the 9th, stating that the changes of the 16th were originally a political issue, but unexpectedly the war broke out, and the people upstream and downstream were devastated. I deeply regret it. I have telegraphed my resignation and requested a ceasefire, and sent personnel to Youxi to discuss the receiving method. According to Lu Xingrong, the commander of the Fifth Brigade, this war has caused great suffering to the soldiers and civilians. I have resigned from my post and submitted a joint telegram. After receiving the telegram, Yang Shuzhuang convened the generals Liu Heding, Fang Shengtao, Chen Jiliang, and Yang Tingjing in the provincial government in the afternoon to discuss response measures. Fang Shengtao advocated first sending out the six captured people, and then concentrating the troops in Youxi to await orders. Liu Heding believed that the military procedure had been more than halfway through, and the elimination of Lu's troops was only in the final battle, and there was no reason to compromise halfway. As a result, Yang Shuzhuang telegraphed the National Government for instructions. At the same time, Yan Er'ai, the deputy division commander of Liu's troops, and the brigade commanders Liu Shangzhi, Lin Shouguo, and Qian Yuguang, also stated that after the capture of Shuikou Huangtian, the first phase of the war was over, and they took this opportunity to reorganize their troops and temporarily suspend the attack, and on the 10th and 11th, they came to the province from the front line to discuss the second phase of the attack on Yanping. Fang Shengtao and Sun Benrong took a steamer to Xiamen and then to Yongchun via Quanzhou, and met with Zhang Zhen, the commander of the newly organized First Division, and decided on the military plan for the western front. The provincial party department still advocated thorough suppression. On the 12th, they again sent two members, Zhan Diaoyuan and Wang Huaijin, to visit Yang Shuzhuang and ask him to strictly order the commanders of the eastern and western fronts to thoroughly eradicate Lu's army. Yang replied that he would convene a joint meeting of the party, government, and military at 2:00 p.m. on the 13th to resolve the issue. After this meeting, a concrete decision on Lu's policy can be made. However, it is said that Lu's final plan is that if peace cannot be achieved, he will lead the remnants of his troops to retreat to the border areas where Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces meet in order to protect himself. He has now contacted Lin Shouchang and He Jinbiao on the Zhejiang border and Wei Chu and Zhou Guanhong on the Jiangxi border. The authorities in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces should take precautions. (October 13)</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The downstream troops attacking Lu have temporarily stopped advancing after capturing Dehua. Military Commissioner Fang Shengtao promoted to the province on September 22, and discussed all plans with Yang Shuzhuang, Liu Heding, and Chen Jiliang, and negotiated Lu Xingming's surrender, and requested the payment of salaries and bullets for the downstream troops. He did not return to Xiamen by steamer until the 10th of this month. It is said that the results of Fang's promotion to the province that the outside world knows are: (1) Sun Benrong represented Lu Xingming to the province to negotiate surrender and incorporation, and there are already some clues. The provincial government proposed that Lu Xingbang immediately resign, first release the five provincial commissioners, and Lu's troops listen to reorganization; (2) Request the Central Government to send four regiments of capable troops to enter Fujian from Zhejiang to cooperate in suppressing Lu. If Lu does not comply, it will be resolved by force; (3) The plan to attack Lu has been slightly changed, and it is divided into four routes: (A) Taking the route from Shuikou, with Liu Heding as the commander-in-chief; (B) Taking the route from Dehua to Datian, with Fang Shengtao as the commander-in-chief, the target is first Youxi, then Yanping; (C) Going straight from Gutian, with Chen Jiliang or Chen Wantai as the commander-in-chief; (D) The Central Government sends four regiments of troops to take the route to Pucheng, the target of these two routes is Yanping. Fang returned to Quanzhou from Xiamen on the 11th and went to the front line in Dehua to command the troops to attack Datian. That is, while negotiating surrender and pacification, he still sends troops to implement both suppression and pacification, hoping to end the war as soon as possible. In addition, Fang and Yang Shuzhuang discussed reorganizing the provincial defense army's training regiment into a brigade and assigning it to the newly organized First Division as the Fifth Brigade. It is said that Yang has agreed. (October 13)</p>

<p>The Municipal Government Has Lodged a Protest with the Japanese Consulate</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch, October 3, 6 PM: A boiler exploded at the power plant of the Japanese Residents' Group in the Japanese Concession of Hankou, resulting in casualties among Chinese people and considerable property damage. The Municipal Government ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate. The investigation revealed that four people, including Wang Xinghe, died, more than ten were seriously injured, and other property damage was extensive. Yesterday, the Municipal Government sent a letter to the Japanese Consul-General in Hankou, requesting that he order separate compensations and condolences to be paid to respect human life. The original letter reads as follows: "Sir, this government received a report from merchants Zhu Xiangtai and Wang Shunchang of Gugu Che, stating that the merchant's two-year-old son, Xinhe, was sitting quietly in the shop around 6 PM on the 3rd of this month when the machine boiler in the Japanese electric lighting room suddenly exploded. He was instantly killed. The police of the 13th Precinct were immediately notified for investigation. The Hankou District Court prosecutor and the Japanese side came to examine the body and confirmed that he died from the explosion. An injury report was filed. The merchant is over thirty years old and this was his only son. It is truly unbearable that he was tragically killed in the explosion. It is appropriate to request a prompt and serious negotiation to respect human life, etc. This government ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate and respond for review and issued a notification. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau reported that the Japanese Residents' Group's power plant boiler explosion resulted in the death and injury of many Chinese people and requested a review. Considering that the reported details were not clear, this government further ordered the relevant police precinct to promptly and thoroughly investigate and report the cause of the incident, the treatment of the injured, and the losses of nearby merchants. Now, the Bureau has responded, stating that the relevant police precinct was ordered to investigate and report within two days after receiving the order. Now, the Precinct Chief, Wan Dixiu, has reported that he immediately dispatched Inspector Xia Duokui to investigate and clarify the situation. He reported that the location of the incident was within the concession and the Chinese people generally claimed ignorance. However, relatives of the power plant workers said that at 6:15 PM on the 3rd of this month, the Japanese Residents' Group's power plant boiler exploded. It was confirmed that Boiler No. 3 was rusty. Additionally, the fire was excessive that night, and the steam pressure became too high, causing the boiler to explode, collapsing the surrounding houses. Therefore, flying bricks and stones injured pedestrians and damaged nearby houses. An investigation was conducted at the affected houses and the power plant, resulting in substantial findings of injuries to people and property damage. In addition to submitting a list of damaged property and diagnosis reports for the injured, all information regarding the Japanese Concession Residents' Group's power plant boiler explosion, injuries to Chinese people, and property damage is respectfully reported for review. Attached are lists of damaged property and a list of injured names from the Japanese Concession Red Cross Hospital. Following prior orders, the original lists are copied and respectfully submitted for your review. The attached tables are submitted for review and referral for negotiation." Attached are two copies of the tables. "Based on this, it is found that the Residents' Group's power plant boiler explosion resulted in deaths, injuries, and property damage. The responsible personnel failed to take preventative measures and neglected their duties. If no order is given for separate compensations and condolences to be paid, human life will not be respected, and there will be no warning. Based on the reported information, in addition to informing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and issuing instructions, copies of the original tables are enclosed and respectfully requested to be reviewed and handled.

<p>Changsha Dispatch: After the Communist bandits Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, Zhu De, and Mao Zedong and their gangs fled into Jiangxi, the gangs of Kong Hechong and Li Baoxing continued to occupy the two counties of Pingjiang and Liuyang, and spread to various towns and villages in Yueyang, Xiangyin, and Changsha, wantonly disturbing the people. The counties have requested the authorities to take advantage of the fact that the large Communist bandit gangs have fled into Jiangxi to quickly dispatch troops to suppress the Communist bandits in Changsha, Yueyang, Pingjiang, and Liuyang to prevent them from spreading. Before He Yingqin went from Hankou to Zhengzhou, he also telegraphed He Jian, urging him to quickly suppress the Communist bandits. Yesterday, He Jian convened a military conference at the General Headquarters, deciding to assign the Independent 7th Brigade of Chen Guangzhong and the Liuyang Security Team to suppress the Communist bandits in Liuyang, and the 31st Division of Tao Guang, the 15th Division of Hou Pengfei, the Independent Regiment of the Headquarters of Ye Wenke, the First Suppression Battalion of Guo Bugao, the Third Suppression Battalion of Zhu Xingshu, and the Training Regiment of the 16th Division of Li Bingguo to suppress the Communist bandits along the railway line and in the three counties of Xiangyin, Yueyang, and Pingjiang.

All of the area from Miluo, Taolin, Huangsha Street, Rongjiawan, and Matang to Yuezhou has been cleared. The Hunan-Hubei train can pass today (17th). It is reported that the Communist bandits have fled to Changle, on the border between Pingjiang and Xiangyin. Tao Guang, Hou Pengfei, and Zhong Guangren have arrived in Miluo to discuss suppression measures. Since the Communist bandits in Hunan are only the two major gangs of Kong (Hechong) and Li (Baoxing), both concentrated in the Pingjiang area, the subsequent suppression is extremely important. Liu Jianxu took the Xiang-E armored train from Changsha to Miluo at 12:00 AM on the 16th to supervise and direct the suppression, and instructed Tao Guang and Hou Pengfei on the suppression strategy. In total, there are around 20 regiments of suppression troops, so they should be able to complete the suppression on schedule. (October 17)</p>

<p>Lu Dipin Has Gone to Beijing for Instructions</p>
<p>Communist Bandits in Yuanhe and Ganjiang Totally Retreat</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Lu Dipin, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Bandit Army, needed to report to Chairman Chiang on the bandit suppression strategies, political measures, and financial reorganization, and to request instructions on everything. Because of his many years of following Dean Tan and deep affection, and because Commander-in-Chief Chiang has returned triumphantly, Lu specially went to Beijing to meet Chiang and to personally pay respects to Tan, to express his condolences. He took a special train on the Nanxun Line at 2:00 AM on the 16th to Xun. Before leaving, he appointed Chief of Staff Xiao as acting Commander-in-Chief, and the Provincial Government elected Lu Xiaochen as acting Chairman to be fully responsible. It is reported that because the military situation for bandit suppression is important, Lu will stay in Beijing for several days, and then return to the province with Tan Daoyuan, to launch a large-scale bandit suppression.</p>
<p>On the 11th, 12th, and 13th, the Zhu-Mao bandit army attacked Zhangshu, with great ferocity. On the government side, the defense line started from Niuxing Station, passed through Gao'an Qingjiangkou, and crossed the Ganjiang River to Xingan. There were fierce battles for several days. In addition to firing intense artillery, the government army had two aircraft that dropped bombs to help in the battle. The bandits lacked ammunition, and the Hunan army attacked their rear, so they retreated after some resistance. Yesterday, according to military sources, the bandits in Gao'an were just guerrillas. After the Gong Division arrived in Gao'an, the bandits fled without a trace. The Communist bandits in Yuanhe have withdrawn from Qingjiang. The Dai Brigade entered Qingcheng on the 15th. The bandits in Ganjiang retreated to Xiajiang. The Zhu Yaohua Brigade recovered Xingan on the 16th. The units continued to pursue. It is reported that the Zhu Mao, Peng Huang gangs are gathering in Fenyi, Lianhua, Yongxin, Ji'an, Jishui, Xiajiang and Yongfeng areas, and are also escaping to the Fujian-Guangdong border via Xingguo, Ningdu, and Shicheng. Therefore, the defense in eastern Jiangxi is strained. The New 13th Division arrived in Fuzhou on the 16th. Division Commander Deng rushed to Fuzhou from the province on the 17th to direct. Regarding the bandit suppression troops coming to Jiangxi, the 148th Brigade of the 50th Division of Cheng Guangyao arrived in Xun yesterday. The 150th Brigade of Luo Shouyi has all arrived in the province. The division headquarters and direct subordinate units are stationed in the provincial capital, successively heading to the front to suppress the bandits. The 60th Brigade of Li Hualing of the Xu Kexiang Division, the 115th and 119th Regiments, arrived in Xun yesterday and will arrive in the province tomorrow. The Luo Lin and Li Jue units of the Hunan Army chasing the bandits have already passed Yuanzhou and are advancing rapidly towards Fenyi. The two divisions of Tao Guang and Qian Dajun are also being transported from Hankou to Xun and then to the province. The Jin Handing, Mao Bingwen, and Li Yunjie divisions are also preparing to come to Jiangxi in sequence. In total, there are more than ten divisions of the above units, and all the Communist bandits can be uprooted, eliminating future troubles forever. (October 17)</p>

<h3 id="e61">Sections of the Guangshan Highway Completed <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Status of Revenue from Traffic on Various Sections</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The construction of the Guangshan Highway has been going on for three years, and the entire road is about to be completed. I asked the Eastern Road Highway Office yesterday about the conditions along the road. According to Director Zhang Youren, the total length of the Guangshan Road is about 1,000 li. The roadbed has been completed for 600 li, there are 100 cars, and 300 li of the road are passable, 300 li have been connected, 600 li of the roadbed have been newly built, and 350 li of the roadbed have been surveyed and are awaiting construction. The conditions of each section are described below:</p>
<p>First Trunk Provincial Road (1) Zhanghui Section (Zhangmutou to Huizhou): The three major bridges of Shima, Guancang, and Puzai, and more than ten other small bridges, are all built with reinforced concrete. The extended route connects to the Huiping section. It is faster to transport vehicles by boat, increasing vehicle speed by 2/10. Currently, it is jointly operated with the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, with a 3/10 reduction in car prices and a 1/10 increase in revenue. (2) Huiping Section (Pingshan to Huizhou): The 140-foot Wutang Bridge has been built. From now on, all bridges on the road will be built with concrete. Recently, the route has been extended to connect to Huizhang Road, and a spacious station has been built near the city area, which has greatly increased passengers. (3) Pinghao Section (Pingshan to Haomen): About 140 li long, 40 li are open to traffic, with 10 cars. Except for the 40 li bandit area of Haomen, the rest is passable. Revenue for the year totaled 4,000 yuan, which is used for construction and management expenses. (4) Haohai Section (Haomen to Haifeng): About 50 li open to traffic. Except for the bandit area, it is all passable. The best roadbed, with a driving speed of 40 mph. In April of this year, the Daye Bridge was burned down by bandits. A three-in-one soil bridge is being rebuilt. The monthly income is about 1,000 yuan. (5) Hailu Section (Haifeng to Lufeng): The roadbed built since 1929 has been repeatedly repaired and transformed with concrete. The Hutiantian Bridge is 400 feet long, with 14 cars. The monthly income is about 8,000 yuan. (6) Lupu Section (Lufeng to Puning): This section starts from Bomei in Lufeng, which is the most prosperous coastline. There are 10 cars running, and the daily income is at most 30 to 40 yuan. Bomei to Kuitan also had a daily income of 20 to 30 yuan. Kuitan to Bengkan, Yunluo, Hanyan, and Chiwei have roughly the same income. The income from Chiwei to De'anli in Puning via Wushi is relatively small. The car company is located in Wushi, which suffered huge losses due to bandits. Traffic has now resumed. The bridge at Kuitan to Puning City is more than 100 miles long, and bandits are rampant, so attention should be paid to the bridges. The bridges at Huiping and Kuitan are all concrete, and the rest are mostly concrete beams to prevent them from being burned down by bandits. The recent losses due to bandits have been gradually repaired, costing several thousand yuan. The car company has been ordered to borrow money for repairs first. (7) Puji Section (Puning to Jieyang): It is 40 li long. The Jieyang section is the best. The Puning Guangtaiwei section has always had many bandits, and the nearby river management office opened the river, so it was not possible to send workers to build it. Near Jieyang City, only the north and south streams have not built wharves, and the bridges have not been directly connected to the Jie'an Road. (8) Jie'an Section (Jieyang to Chao'an): The Jieyang section has not yet been completed. The Chao'an section has been open to traffic for a long time. The bridges built several years ago have been severely damaged, and the roadbed is low and sunken, and it has not been filled in yet. The section near the border of the two counties has not yet been built. (9) Boxiang Section (Dongjiang Boluo to Lanshui): Completely new construction, already open to traffic. The daily income averages 40 to 50 yuan, and it is expected to develop in the future.</p>
<p>First Trunk Line of the Eastern Road: Bohui Section (Boluo to Huizhou): 43 li have been surveyed. Several li of the first branch line have been opened. (1) Puning to Shantou: 15 li from Chaoyang to Dazhao, 20 li from Heping, and 15 li from Jiaoshi to Leikou have been built. 35 li from Chaoyang to Hepingwei have been repaired. All of the above are open to traffic. (2) Chao'an to Huanggang: 3 li from Zhanglin to Jiuhe, and 2 li in the middle of Anzhai are open to traffic.</p>
<p>Second Trunk Line of the Eastern Road: The second trunk line had more than 100 li surveyed in September 1929. The Xinji Boluo to Heyuan is 40 li. Several miles are passable. The twenty miles along the river and forty miles on the south bank of the river from Heyuan to Longchuan are passable. Longchuan to Wuhua, Longchuan to Laolong, Qiling to Languan, and Dapu to Fengshi have been surveyed and are now under construction in order.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Report on Recent Administrative Policies of the Mongolian Committee <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>On the 18th, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission sent specialist member Enhe Amur to the Central Radio Broadcasting Station to report on the recent administrative situation of the commission as follows: "Today, I am here on behalf of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to give a report. There are four items to report. First, the facilities for Mongolian and Tibetan education. All undertakings in Mongolia and Tibet are backward, and the current shortcomings seem to be especially serious in education. Because education is not developed, there is no hope of progress in any matter. The central government also considers this very important. The Second National Education Conference in April of this year resolved to implement a plan for Mongolian and Tibetan education. The content of the plan is very thorough and detailed. In June of this year, when the central government convened the Mongolia-Gili Conference, the Ministry of Education sent the original plan to the commission and submitted it to the conference for discussion. The representatives of the various leagues and banners and the representatives of the governments of the border provinces unanimously agreed that it was feasible. The original plan has been approved and implemented in accordance with the planned procedures. The various levels of education in Mongolia and Tibet will definitely improve day by day. Once there is a solution for education, there will be no worries about talent. Therefore, all undertakings in Mongolia and Tibet can also gradually develop. However, for the past six months, wars have been frequent, and Mongolia and Tibet are far from Beijing. Although there is a very good plan, we still cannot actually implement it. This is something that the committee regrets. Now that the military affairs have ended and the country has been reunified, it is the duty of the commission to implement the plan step by step in order to develop Mongolian and Tibetan education. The Third Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Party resolved to establish one Mongolian-Tibetan school in the capital and in suitable locations in Mongolia and Tibet to accommodate Mongolian and Tibetan youth, so that they can prepare for various subjects and serve as a reserve for training and construction personnel in Mongolia and Tibet, and to attach a Mongolian-Tibetan research class to specialize in researching, guiding, and promoting all matters in Mongolia and Tibet. Based on this resolution, the commission, together with the Ministry of Education, intends to establish one Mongolian-Tibetan school in the capital and Kangding. The organizational outlines of the two schools have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for promulgation. Once funds are available, they can be opened separately. Regarding the establishment of Mongolian-Tibetan classes attached to the Central Beijing Two Universities, since the commission circulated the news to Mongolia and Tibet, a total of sixty to seventy Mongolian and Tibetan students arrived this summer. Before entering the school, the commission provided all food and accommodation and contacted the Ministry of Education and Central University to open the class procedures. Only due to funding reasons, it is still difficult to establish the classes for a while. The committee believes that it is not easy for Mongolian and Tibetan students to travel thousands of miles to Beijing to study, and it is a pity to waste time. Therefore, the committee consulted with the Central Training Department to open a special class in the Central Political School, intending to name it the Mongolian-Tibetan Local Autonomy Class, to accommodate the Mongolian and Tibetan students who came to Beijing this time and cultivate Mongolian and Tibetan autonomous talents. However, the Mongolian-Tibetan class of Central University should still be urged to open as soon as possible, so that Mongolian and Tibetan students who continue to come to Beijing can enroll and study further. This is a point about education. Second, the committee has an office in Peiping, which has been suspended for the past six months due to various military and political reasons. Now that Peiping and Tianjin have been restored to their former appearance, the commission has appointed specialist member Ma neighboring area to take over and stationed the staff permanently in Peiping, responsible for reorganizing the office affairs. Third, the relationship between the central government and Tibet is now relatively close. The Dalai Lama previously sent Kunqiao Zhongni as a plenipotentiary representative to come to Beijing for engagement. At that time, Chairman Chiang was still at the front, and Chairman Ma of the commission accompanied Representative Kun to the front to meet the chairman. The results of the engagement were very satisfactory. According to Representative Kun, the Dalai also sent representatives to come to Beijing later. All matters concerning engagement between the central government and Tibet must be discussed when the representatives arrive in Beijing. Recently, the commission replies to every telegram it sends to the Dalai, and the Dalai also often sends telegrams on his own initiative, expressing his support for the central government. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in the twenty years since the founding of the Republic of China. Since the Dalai is sincerely inclined to the central government, there will soon be a considerable solution for the future of the central government and Tibet. Fourth, the commission had preparations last year to organize a new Mongolian and Tibetan Youth Investigation Group, intending to investigate the actual situation of new Mongolian and Tibetan youth as a basis for construction. However, due to repeated upheavals and traffic disruptions, it has not been implemented to this day. However, there are many foreign public and private organizations or individuals who are now going to Mongolia to carry out investigation work, but we do not have this organization to allow foreigners to wantonly dig and excavate, and even pack them away in boxes. This loss of antiquities is really detrimental to national sovereignty. Therefore, the commission regards the dispatch of personnel for investigation as very important. Now that the military affairs have ended, it is planned to continue the plan of last year and send personnel to Mongolia and Tibet for investigation as soon as possible."</p>
<h3 id="e63">Total Value of Agricultural and Mineral Products in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Reaching Over 3 Billion Yuan Annually</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining has always attached great importance to agricultural and mineral statistics. However, before the statistical work in various counties is sound and the weights and measures are unified, it is inevitable that there will be difficulties in the progress. Although agricultural investigators have been sent to various counties for field surveys, it is still difficult to obtain accurate and complete results for the time being due to various reasons. Recently, the department sent a letter to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting the bureau to distribute the forms it had prepared to various counties to investigate the status of agricultural and mineral products. The counties have successively filled in the reports and the department has sorted them out. Although the content is very simple, it still has the value of an overview. The total value of agricultural and mineral products and by-products in the province is 3,194,526,533 yuan annually. Among them, agricultural products account for 75.11%, aquatic products account for 17.72%, forest products account for 0.85%, mineral products account for 0.88%, livestock and poultry and by-products account for 5.39%, and others account for 0.05%.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Soviet Russia Recruiting Troops in Harbin <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Selecting from Overseas Chinese in the Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>Leaving a Unit to Guard the Russian Consulate</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Soviet Russia recently sent personnel to Harbin to recruit new recruits for the National Defense Army from overseas Chinese. There are a total of five members of the recruitment committee, including three specialists sent by the Soviet Russian government, and the other two are appointed by the Consul General of Harbin, Melinigov, and the Consul General of Liaoning, Zinannisky, and appointed as chairman and vice-chairman. The recruitment committee office is located in the Russian Consulate in Harbin. According to the general practice of national defense, it is appropriate to inform the local government when recruiting troops from foreigners in the host country. However, the Russian consulate and others ignore the usual practice and implement it directly. Our side was completely unaware of it beforehand. Only because the authorities did not want to cause trouble, they allowed them to handle it freely. The recruitment method is to select pure Soviet Russian citizens residing in the Eastern Provinces, aged 18 to 40, with secondary education as qualified. Those who have already been enlisted are issued military uniforms. Therefore, in recent days, there are many Russians in military uniforms wandering in the streets of Harbin, and they run rampant in the city streets. The local police have no way to interfere. It is reported that the number of soldiers to be recruited in the Eastern Provinces is 2,500 in total. They have been sent back to the country in batches in recent days. Each batch has 40 to 50 people at most, and 20 to 30 people at least. Every time they board the train, all the Soviet Russian overseas Chinese in the city go to the station to see them off, and the situation is very enthusiastic. After the recruitment of these new recruits is completed, they will be trained in Chita. It is stipulated that they will be sent to the eastern border to be stationed in two months. The original National Defense Army will be transferred back to the western European border to be stationed. It is reported that in addition to sending most of the recruits back to their country, a small part will be left in plain clothes to guard the Russian consulates in Liaoning and Harbin. The total consulate is allotted 100 people, and the branch consulates are allotted 30 to 50 people. (11th)</p>

<p>Fire Drill Causes Misunderstanding: The Firefighting Association summoned a total of sixteen foreign water pumps and four pump trucks from the four districts of the city today (19th) to perform the drill in the open space of Caihua Jing as usual. Representatives from various agencies attended the scene to watch. Tang Renmei, the president of the association, and two others served as judges. In order to observe the firefighting performance of this session, a straw house was specially built, sprinkled with kerosene and ignited, so that each pump could rush to rescue, which was more grand than in previous sessions. Firefighting associations from various places in Shanghai's Second District, Qingpu, Jinshan, Xinbang and Fengjing all came to Songjiang in formation to watch. Unexpectedly, when the pump competition was halfway through, three members of the Dawang Temple used leather belts, exceeding the prescribed number of people, and were reported by members of the Sanxiu pump. The judges on the command platform immediately summoned the Dawang Temple pump members to report, in order to deduct points. However, the crowd was noisy and could not be summoned for a long time. The Sanxiu pump believed that the judges were unfair, and took off their copper hats and uniforms and threw them on the judging platform. Some people even removed the red board of the water spraying standard, and the order could not be maintained. It was announced that it would be stopped and resolved at a meeting.</p>
<p>Lüxiang Robbery Case: The Stolen Goods and Bandits Will Soon Be Brought to Justice: Fan Zicheng, the captain of the First Squadron of the Songjiang Water Police, immediately led the police to the scene after receiving the robbery alarm in Lüxiang. After jointly searching with the police of the whole county's Public Security Team, Liu Zhigao, the platoon leader stationed in Zhujing, and Lai, the army company commander, captured thirteen bandits, including Li Xiaoer and the monk Gengtai, from Dacheng An in the south corner of Lüxiang, and escorted them back to Zhujing for interrogation. On the 16th, three large packages of stolen goods, including 23 pieces of silk satin, Zhigong tweed, and leather clothing, were seized at Yao Laiyu's house in Nijiabang, Yucang. Yao was arrested and confessed without hesitation. The stolen goods were identified by the owners of Yao Jinmao and Ma Hengchang's shops as correct, and all were handed over to the court for handling. Now the military and police are still searching in separate ways according to the confessed hiding place of the bandits.</p>

<p>Details of the Strike at the Defeng Silk Factory: The Silk Factory Association of Xiyi previously held a general meeting of members at the County Chamber of Commerce on the Double Tenth Festival due to the tragic decline in the silk market and the difficulty for various factories to start reeling. It was decided on the spot to follow the example of various factories in Shanghai, and all wages of factory workers and employees would be paid at 80% from October to maintain the precarious situation. On the 15th of this month, the Defeng Silk Factory under Jinjun Bridge outside Nanmen implemented this decision when paying wages, and paid 80%. All the workers accepted it, but some employees refused to receive it. Unexpectedly, the next day (16th), some employees held a meeting behind Zhangwang Temple and decided to unite with the workers to implement a strike as a countermeasure. On the morning of the 17th, the factory rang the return sound as usual, and only half of the workers went to work. The rest of the female workers were wandering outside the factory, implementing a strike, and the order was very chaotic. Seeing that the factory had gone on strike and fearing that something would happen, the factory immediately called the third branch of the Public Security Bureau to send the police to suppress it to maintain order. At the same time, the Silk Factory Workers' Union, after hearing the news, sent Ding Shaochu to the factory to investigate and mediate, but the result was not satisfactory. Yesterday, the factory workers who joined the strike organized a strike committee and issued leaflets containing twelve requirements: (1) Oppose the expulsion of workers and friends, (2) Oppose the closure of the factory, (3) Wages will be paid as usual when the factory is closed, (4) Wages will be paid in full, and no reduction will be allowed, (5) No scolding of workers and friends is allowed, (6) Request to dismiss the chief steward Che Changmao, (7) Acknowledge that the strike committee has full representation of the workers to negotiate all strike matters, (8) Increase the wages of child laborers, (9) No work on Sundays, and wages will be paid as usual, (10) Oppose armed suppression of workers, (11) Implement an eight-hour work system, (12) Wages will be paid as usual during the strike period, and workers and friends shall not be dismissed on any pretext. On that day, the Silk Factory Association held a meeting, and Wang Kexing and Wang Rongshen, representatives of the Defeng Silk Factory, reported the process of the factory's strike. It was decided unanimously to provide assistance, and the representatives of the factory attending the meeting were notified to allow the extension of the shutdown period. If it is not resolved by November 15th, a countermeasure will be determined.</p>
<p>Silk Factory Industry Meeting Discusses Relief Issues: Shanghai and Wuxi silk factories have recently suspended operations one after another due to sluggish silk sales and inability to maintain business. The Shanghai Silk Factory Association convened representatives of silk factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai the day before yesterday to hold a relief conference. The representatives of the silk factories in this city who were dispatched to attend have returned to Wuxi from Shanghai, and a special 34th general meeting of members was convened yesterday afternoon to discuss relief issues. Representatives of 40 factories, including Xinlun, Minfeng, Yongfeng and Run, and 36 people, including Chen Fangquan, Fu Peide and Qin Shirong, attended. First, Qian, the chairman, reported the process of attending the relief conference in Shanghai. Then, they discussed the issues of borrowing public bonds and repayment methods. Zhang Zizhen expressed two opinions: (1) It is necessary for the factories in this city to borrow public bonds, which should be decided by each factory according to the situation. (2) The factories that borrow public bonds should follow the outline decided by the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai Silk Industry Relief Special Committee, and levy a debt repayment fund of 20 taels of customs silver for each bundle of silk exported. If no public bonds are borrowed, there is no need to pay the debt repayment fund, as in the case of Shanghai Ewo and Suzhou Ruifeng. All the representatives agreed with this proposal and passed it unanimously. It was also decided to report this resolution at the second representative conference to be held in Shanghai on the 22nd. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>Jiang Hong Case Trial and Interrogation: Ji Shashi, the mother of Ji Hehua from Beiwai, sued Jiang Hong for suspicion of defrauding money. Yesterday (18th), the county government issued tickets to summon the related parties Mei Anlan, Yan Hongzhuang, Yin Zhongren, and Chen Zhongda for interrogation. None of Mei and others appeared in court, only submitting statements. The investigation court was opened at 4 pm, and the plaintiff Ji Shashi was present. Jiang Hong was interrogated by Yang Cheng. According to Ji Shashi, around July 6th of the lunar calendar, Jiang Hong came to my house and said that he was a friend of his son Hehua and tried to help him, but money was necessary, and he wanted 5,000 yuan, saying that he had contacted Mei Anlan. At Zhang Jingying's house on Dongda Street, I agreed to 3,000, Mei said 4,000, and then added 1,000, not in cash, but all Chengfeng Zhuang bills, which were paid to him around the middle of July in the lunar calendar. Later, he exchanged 2,000 in cash, 1,000 in banknotes, and 1,000 in Zhuang bills. Jiang promised that Hehua would be released from prison in about three days. Around August 8th of the lunar calendar, Jiang said that Hehua could be released on bail. She waited for a day, but there was no news. The next day, she went to Zhang's house to ask Anlan Hongzhuang, and Jiang also came. He said that he wanted Hehua to admit some communist incidents and write a sentence. When she heard about it, she knew that Jiang was cheating her, and went home and cried bitterly at the back door, wanting to drown herself. He said that the 5,000 yuan was for expenses, and he would open an account with her after Hehua was released from prison, and did not explain what the expenses were. Jiang Hong said that Ji Shashi's statement was completely inconsistent with the facts. I did not go to Ji's house. Ji Shashi often came to the Southeast Rural Society to see me, asking me to find a way to rescue Hehua, and even came to my house in the rain in the month (Xiachang Zhao Chun), and the sedan chair bearers, one named Zhang and one named Li, can be called as witnesses. She wanted to send me 1,000 yuan in banknotes, and I refused. Later, her husband Chengyu, Mei Anlan, and Hongzhuang came to say that Hehua's family was willing to donate 10,000 yuan to purchase guns for the local area. I told the county magistrate about it, but he did not agree. Later, I told Li, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to the county magistrate, but he also did not agree. His family had requested it in writing, but it was also rejected. Mei and others asked me to help, and gave me 5,000 yuan in Zhuang bills. 2,000 yuan was donated to the relief home, and 3,000 yuan was used for local gun management, entrusting me to keep it. When Hehua is released from prison, he will write a donation slip. I also told Meng Yaping, a member of the party department, about this matter, but he did not say yes or no. The Hong Ji account on the bill is that the 2,000 yuan deposited in the relief home has been used up. It is deposited under a private name, and 100 yuan was deposited for the food expenses of the medical center. Because it happened to be the Mid-Autumn Festival, the director Wang Gengjun urgently wanted to pay it. He had requested the county magistrate, thinking that the 2,000 yuan donation could be used. However, after this was preserved, there was no way to release Hehua. The day before yesterday (4th), while eating wine at Huachang, I discussed the method with Yin Zhongren, Li Gong, Director of the Bureau, and Wang Guanqin. I wholeheartedly confessed, and now I am suffering for others, and I only hate my excessive enthusiasm. Please the court to call Mei Anlan and others as witnesses. When Jiang Hong was giving his statement, Ji Shashi denied hiring a sedan chair to Jiang's house at Yueqiao. After a fierce debate, Ji Shashi wiped her tears frequently with a towel, showing her eagerness to protect her son. The interrogation took a long time. The court ordered Mei Anlan and others to be summoned to court for interrogation, and at the same time to conduct a detailed investigation of the facts before reviewing the case. Ji Shashi was handed over to the original guarantor, and Jiang Hong was taken back into custody.</p>

<p>—Their strength is far inferior to before—They suffered a defeat of one to five—</p>
<p>Lehua Football Team lost to Huasais by a score of one to five in the Westerners' League A yesterday. Huasais last year, although as strong as today, was not an opponent of Lehua. Now that the times have changed and the environment is different, those who have lost have turned to worship. When I think of those years, I can't help but sigh.</p>
<h3 id="e81">(1) Spectators Were Like Clouds <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Lehua's fame has long been soaring in Shanghai. Although the veterans have been scattered and the strength has been greatly damaged, the talents recruited are also of good reputation. Therefore, Shanghai fans are eager to know what Lehua's strength is today compared with previous years. The road to Father Lao was crowded and bustling. Inside the China Baseball Stadium, there were mountains of people, and the number was the highest ever in this session.</p>
<h3 id="e82">(2) Interest Is Greatly Reduced <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Lehua's performance on that day was disappointing. Only Li Huitang was still as good as ever. The work of passing and shooting was indeed worthy of appreciation. The rest was mediocre. The whole team's organization was at the beginning, and the individuality could not be mutually understood. Li Ning, Chen Yutian and others did not participate. How can we achieve the effect of unified arms? Therefore, the forward attack was without any steps, and the defense inside was stable. Within 90 minutes, they were oppressed by the enemy. Occasionally breaking the encirclement, it is difficult to show prestige in a foreign land. If there was no Li Huitang with special skills to hit a ball, wouldn't the whole army be annihilated? Viewers were greatly reduced to this point of interest.</p>
<h3 id="e83">(3) Two Teams <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>

<p>Referee Lei Tai blew his silver whistle, and the two teams deployed their formations. Soon, the fierce battle began. First, Hua Sai Si launched an invasion, and Le Hua resisted from all sides. Finally, An Yuan Sheng led the escape from danger. Li Hui Tang passed the ball with his head, and Yang Ren Wei greeted and sent it to the center, forcing a corner kick, which was ineffective. Hua Sai Si attacked again, deeply penetrating the heart of Le Hua's defense, but their entire effort was wasted due to an offside on the left wing. At that time, Le Hua's morale was high, and their attack and defense were both fierce and imposing. In the blink of an eye, Li Hui Tang cleverly evaded and provided a good opportunity for Xi Qiao Sheng to attack, but the shot was too weak and was saved by the goalkeeper. Li then used his lively movements, roaming across the left area, unexpectedly picked a pass to the front of the goal. The goalkeeper and inside defender were unable to turn around in time, and the goal was wide open. Xi Qiao Sheng moved forward, met the ball with his head, and with a loud thud, it crossed the goal line. The audience, after their disappointment, could only force a wry smile.</p>
<h3 id="e85">(5) Great Merit <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Le Hua launched several attacks, but none hit the enemy's vital points, and the vigor of their forwards was almost completely exhausted. Fortunately, the defense of the backs was still able to fulfill its duty. Lu Zhong En, alone, blocked the enemy's charge, falling to the ground to save the ball, and succeeded. His merit was great. The danger was not over, and the enemy invaded from the left again, shooting fiercely at the goal. Lu raised a single palm to catch it, once again escaping danger. Then the enemy shot a ball from the ground, with great momentum. Lu bent down to block it, again ensuring safety.</p>
<h3 id="e86">(6) Greatly Reduced Vitality <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>After twenty minutes, Le Hua's resistance gradually weakened. The greatest hidden danger was their internal disarray, scattered or gathered, with no order. At that time, a ball came from the left, and the two inside defenders were at a loss, each using their bodies to block the advance of the left and right inside forwards. Lu Zhong En took the opportunity to come forward and steal the ball, but suddenly collided and fell to the ground. The right inside forward Xu Er added a foot and hit the ball into the goal. Within two minutes, the right winger Mai Lie Tai lofted a high ball. The strong wind carried the ball, swirling in the air, and the inside defenders did not know what to do. The center forward Bo Te shot another ball into the goal. Le Hua lost two goals in a row and became greatly enraged. Xi Qiao Sheng got another chance to shoot, but it was caught by the goalkeeper. Cui Yang charged fiercely, and the goalkeeper fell to the ground, but still held on tightly. Finally, relying on his strong body, he broke through the encirclement and escaped danger. But Hua Sai Si's forwards went straight in, winning two corner kicks in a row. As a result of the second corner kick, center forward Bo Te again hit the ball into the net. By this time, Hua Sai Si had won three goals, while Le Hua had none.</p>
<h3 id="e87">(7) Quick Action <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Since Le Hua had lost ground, they were determined to regain it. At the start of the second half, Le Hua changed their formation, as shown in the previous table. At that moment, Hua Sai Si was dazzled by the shifting formations, and the situation was slightly chaotic. Li Hui Tang emerged as a surprise force, assisting Xi Qiao Sheng in their advance. When the opportunity arrived, they immediately attacked the goal, with great momentum and strength. The goalkeeper could not block it, and the ball still went into the goal past the post. With one goal scored, their morale was greatly boosted. Ten minutes later, Le Hua encountered another good opportunity. Li and Yang both approached the enemy's goal, but unfortunately, they hindered each other, making it difficult to shoot. Otherwise, there would have been another amazing move.</p>
<h3 id="e88">(8) A Disorganized Mess <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>From then on, Hua Sai Si's activity suddenly increased. The front army won victory after victory, with irresistible force. Le Hua's internal organization was like a disorganized mess, beyond repair. In the last ten minutes, they lost two more goals in a row, one scored by the center forward and one by the left inside forward. The latter goal was clear and beautiful, truly worthy of praise. At the end of the battle, Hua Sai Si won with a score of five to one.</p>

<p>Result: Six to Two</p>
<p>The Lingnan Football Team in the "Zhong" Group of the Chinese Football Club can also be called a strong team. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, they competed against Baota in the "Zuo" Group at the Chinese Football Field. The referee was Tang Zhong Guang.</p>
<p>Lingnan was strong both internally and externally, gaining an upper hand. Chen Hong Guang opened the scoring, and Liang Min Fa followed, scoring the second goal. Under pressure, Baota launched fierce attacks, but retreated unfavorably because the opposing formation was well-organized. Baota lost the first half with a score of 0-2.</p>
<p>In the second half, Lingnan, with its rich experience, had already discovered the opponent's weaknesses. They seized the opportunity to attack and achieved their desires. Baota defended key positions and tried hard to resist, but they were too weak and unable to defend everywhere. Soon, Chen Hong Guang scored the third goal, and Zhuo Guo Rong added another goal. Chen then scored another goal. Baota, after conceding five goals, became enraged. The forward line surged in like a tide. Lingnan was momentarily careless and accidentally kicked the ball into their own goal. But before long, Liang Min Fa again showed his skills and scored another goal. In a counter-attack, Baota had the opportunity for a penalty kick, but they did not score directly. However, Wang Zhang Bao also regained a goal as a result, making the result two to six. Victory went to Lingnan.</p>

<p>—Result: Five to Four—</p>
<p>—Ticket Rush Occurs—</p>
<p>—The Audience is Very Lively—</p>
<p>Tokyo, Electric Communication on the 19th. The second Keio-Waseda match was very lively. The game started at 2:00 PM today with Keio batting first. Keio's pitcher was Ueno, and the catcher was Ogawa. Waseda used Ito as the pitcher, with Miura guarding the home plate, preparing for Keio's strong hitters. In the first inning, Waseda scored one point first, gaining the upper hand. Keio got a chance in the first half of the second inning, scoring two points, reversing the situation and winning by one point. In the third and fourth innings, both sides did not score, fighting fiercely. In the first half of the fifth inning, Keio scored another point. In the second half of this inning, when Waseda was attacking, Keio replaced Ueno with Mizuhara to restrain Waseda. In the sixth inning, Waseda also sent Ito away, replacing him with Tashiro Ogawa. Neither team scored in the sixth inning. In the first half of the seventh inning, Keio scored another point. Waseda replaced Ogawa, and Tasei came on from the middle. In the second half of this inning, when Waseda attacked, Keio changed the pitcher to Miyatake and the catcher to Okada, refreshing their formation. Waseda failed to score. By this inning, the score was four to one. Although Waseda's situation was unfavorable, in the second half of the eighth inning, they still launched a desperate attack, breaking through Miyatake's fierce ball and scoring three points in one fell swoop, making the score a tie of four to four. The entire stadium stood up and shouted wildly. Only a small number of Waseda supporters danced in disorder. In the last ninth inning, Keio seized the opportunity to cleverly score one point. Waseda sent a support batter to pursue, but it was ineffective. Finally, Keio won again with a score of five to four, singing victory songs. The game ended at 4:30 PM. The referees were Qian Cun (ball), Yokozawa, and Tenchi (base). The results of the battle are as follows:</p>
<p>Keio 0 2 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 5</p>
<p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</p>
<p>Waseda 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 4</p>
<p>Tokyo, Electric Communication on the 19th. Due to the ticket issue for the Keio-Waseda match, the dispute between Waseda University and the students suddenly turned into a purely student disturbance around the time the Keio-Waseda match began yesterday afternoon. When the game at the Meiji Jingu Stadium was in full swing, and the entire city was in a state of frenzy, the entire Waseda United Student Committee was holding a general assembly at the Okuma Auditorium in Waseda University, with successive speeches, and the atmosphere was high. At 5:30 PM, the entire audience unanimously decided to publish the following articles:</p>
<p>1. Recognize the entire Waseda United Student Committee.</p>
<p>2. Deny the Athletic Association and order its immediate dissolution.</p>
<p>3. Those responsible for this incident must apologize.</p>
<p>4. Explain the reason for the temporary holiday on the 18th.</p>
<p>5. Absolutely oppose the illegal punishment by the school authorities.</p>
<p>The school is holding an emergency meeting to request countermeasures. Last night, they rejected the committee's request for a meeting. This morning at 9:00 AM, they will hold another faculty meeting to request a proper settlement. The school's attitude seems to be quite firm. The root cause of this dispute is that since the military education incident the year before last, the students' autonomy has been suddenly reduced. The students' dissatisfaction with the school authorities has been brewing for a long time. The ticket incident triggered the outbreak. The undergraduate department, higher academy, specialized department, and normal school, totaling 13,000 students who had no contact mechanism, immediately elected class committees to organize the entire Waseda Student United Committee to confront the school. The strategy of boycotting tickets was successful. The dissatisfaction with the school authorities suddenly erupted, turning a mere ticket incident into a major issue.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Northeast Four Provinces Joint Games (1) <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Record of the First Day</p>
<p>Shenyang Communication. The first Northeast United Games opened on the 11th at the newly built sports field of Northeastern University in Beiling. President Zhang Xueliang personally attended the venue to give words of encouragement. 96 groups participated in the competition, with 1,060 male and female athletes and more than 20,000 spectators. Here is a detailed record of the various situations on the first day.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue The venue is in the Northeastern University Stadium, which was built with a donation of 400,000 yuan from Zhang Hanqing. Construction lasted for a year and has now been completed. It was designed and built by the Jietai Construction Company, which is most famous in North China. Everything is very scientific. There is a long arc-shaped grandstand on the northeast three sides, stretching for two li. When the North China Games were held in Shenyang last year, as well as the Sino-Japanese-German competition, they were all held here, but at that time the field was not fully repaired. Now it is completely new, solemn and grand. On the east and west sides of the field, there are president's platforms. The decoration of the west platform is even better than the east platform. The opening ceremony of the conference was held on the west platform. In addition, the audience grandstand has 12 levels, each level is represented by a character, from bottom to top, according to the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches (Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, Hai). Each seat is numbered separately. Due to the large number of guests, seats were not arranged according to the numbers. There are 15 entrances to the field. The door frame is marked with a thousand characters, from "Tian" to "Lie." The door under the west chairman's platform is the "Xuan" character door. In order to maintain order in the venue, the conference organizing committee stamped the character marked on the door on the admission ticket and entered according to the character. In addition, two Boy Scouts were assigned to each gate to be responsible for checking tickets to prevent confusion, so the order on the grandstand was excellent. A wooden clock is hung directly north of the platform, with a diameter of about two feet. The hour and minute hands are three inches thick. All high and low places throughout the venue are clearly visible. The clock is manually operated by a Boy Scout, who is responsible for moving it every ten minutes, which is a perfect method. On this day, from about 6:00 AM, various primary and secondary schools in the city arrived in groups.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony At 9:00 AM, Zhang Xueliang and his wife Yu Fengzhi arrived at the venue and the meeting began. The players of each team stood under the chairman's platform. The master of ceremonies called to play music and raise the flag. The flagpole was set up in the southern part of the field. In the gentle breeze, the bright blue and white flag slowly rose. Then, all the people present, led by Deputy Commander Zhang, bowed three times to the flag of the party and the country. After the ceremony, Zhang Xueliang respectfully read the Premier's will and sang the party song. Then, the chairman of the organizing committee gave a report, briefly stating that the conference was held with the support of Deputy Commander Zhang and various circles. All expenses were borne by Deputy Commander Zhang personally and the Hanqing Education Foundation Committee. He expressed his deep gratitude. However, in terms of expenses, he tried his best to be thrifty. There are currently 96 participating groups and 51 competition items. As for the competition rules and order in the venue, President Wang will report again, etc. Then Wang Hua Yi reported, briefly stating that after the closing of this conference, he will proceed to organize a (Northeast Sports Association).</p>
<p>President's Speech Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang, carrying his wife, attended the venue and gave a speech, saying, "Dear teachers, staff, and players, participating in today's grand event, more than a thousand athletes gathered in one place, showing the spirit of youth in competition. Therefore, I would like to say a few words. The pain of the failure of the last Far East Games, and the fluke of the national sports in the Northeast, have been described in detail by President Wang Hua Yi. Today, the best results created by our country's athletes cannot only be maintained permanently, but are shrinking daily. This is even more important than actual failure. There are many reasons for this, but in a nutshell, it is a lack of training. Other things, such as the society's excessive praise of athletes, are also enough to cultivate athletes' vanity and laziness. You must know that athletes engage in sports not for what they hope to gain, as do those who do business. Moreover, sports honor is public, not personal. Therefore, all players must broaden their horizons. Even speaking of this conference, this is the first one. There are still the second and third sessions to come. If we fail this time, we can still compete for victory another day. Even if we win this time, we still have to compare with the whole country. If the whole country wins, we still have to participate in the Far East Games and other events. The future is bright. Without hard work and training, it is difficult to achieve the final effect. Flukes cannot succeed permanently, and failure is not permanent failure. I hope all players will remember this and not forget it."</p>
<p>Oath Parade After the President's speech, the sports oath was taken. The text said, "(I solemnly swear to abide by the competition rules, obey the referees, and maintain sportsmanship with amateur sports qualifications.)" Then there was a parade.</p>
<p>Athletes from various places (A) Middle School Group for Men: Liaoning 56, Jilin 48, East Special 39, Heilongjiang 47, (B) Middle School Group for Women: Liaoning 80, Jilin 36, East Special 19, Heilongjiang 10, (C) High School Group for Men: Liaoning 81, Jilin 17, East Special 15, Dalian 9, Individual participants 8, (D) High School Group for Women: Liaoning 26, Jilin 5, East Special 5.</p>

<h3 id="e98">City No. 1 Stadium Athletic Sports Meet <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The City No. 1 Public Stadium Athletic Sports Meet began at 8:00 AM yesterday and ended at 4:00 PM. Due to thunderstorms the night before, the ground was slightly wet in the morning, and some athletes failed to participate on schedule. But after 9:00 AM, the sun appeared and the weather cleared, and the sports field was neither dry nor wet, making it ideal for competition. Therefore, the players were full of energy and competed to be the first to reach the top. Here is a record of the situation:</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony At 8:00 AM, the bell rang for the opening ceremony. The president, referees, staff, and athletes gathered in front of the chairman's platform and performed the rituals. President Wang Zhuangfei delivered the opening speech, briefly stating that he welcomed everyone who participated in the conference and came to compete in their spare time. The purpose of this conference is to showcase everyone's achievements, attract the attention of the general public, and encourage them to practice sports and exercise their bodies, and to prove the depth of everyone's daily training and the extent of their physical fitness. From now on, we will increase our interest and continue to practice to reach the highest standards. I hope that everyone will compete with the spirit of amateur sports and will be able to implement this purpose.</p>
<p>Spectators There were fewer spectators in the morning, about 700 or 800 people. In the afternoon, the number gradually increased to 2,000 or 3,000 people. When there were long-distance races, they often cheered to boost the spirits of the runners, and the interest was particularly strong. The order of the venue was maintained by the Boy Scouts of the East Asia Sports School, and it was well-organized.</p>
<p>Track and Field Events None of the famous athletes participated in this sports meet, giving the opportunity to new athletes to win the championship. The intention was excellent. Therefore, although the results of the competition failed to create special records, the large number of participants and the full spirit of the competition were also indelible achievements. It is a pity that in the 400-meter final in the afternoon, Guan Changfa suddenly moved diagonally to the outer lane midway, obstructing the progress of the person behind him. After the inspector reported to the chief referee, his results were cancelled. The procedure was completely in compliance. Unexpectedly, Guan Changfa was a member of the Baihong team, and more than a dozen members of the same team, acting on impulse, wanted to withdraw from the sports meet, and even the finish line referee Song Zean left at the same time due to his relationship with the Baihong team members, which was a pity. Here are the results of each competition:</p>
<p>Event 1st Place 2nd Place 3rd Place 4th Place Results</p>
<p>100m Guan Changfa Chen Ze Lin Xue Jian Qiu Xia Guang Yu 12. seconds</p>
<p>200m Chen Bao Lin Xue Jian Qiu Qu Jin Fa Wang Ya Mu 26.2 seconds</p>

<p>800m Liang Yan Ping Zhang Yu Xiang Jiang Kun Lu Shou Xiang 2 minutes 24.8 seconds</p>
<p>1500m Liang Yan Ping Zhang Yu Xiang Wu Feng Qi Bao Sha Bi 5 minutes 7 seconds</p>
<p>3000m Zhang Quan Zhou Chen Ping Wu Cui Qi Wang Jian Zhang 11 minutes 20 seconds</p>

<p>Shot Put Zhang Nian Chun Dong Zhao Bin Xi Shu Gu Fang Yi Liang 11.67 meters</p>
<p>Pole Vault Chen Shao Qing Fang Yi Liang Chen Fu Ji 2.74 meters</p>
<p>It is noted that Dong Zhao Bin's long jump broke his own record of six meters from the previous session, and Zhang Nian Chun's shot put broke his own record of 11.59 meters from the previous session. Both were excellent results at the meeting.</p>
<p>National Arts In the morning, the women and children's venue was wet, and the performance could not be held. Therefore, it was changed to start at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. More than 60 members of the National Arts Department participated in the performance. The performance items included boxing, weapons, sparring, Zhai Jin, boxing, wrestling, sword fighting, Ju Sheng, everything was available. Among them, sparring and sword fighting were the most popular with the audience because of their quick eyes and hands.</p>
<p>Awards At 3:30 PM, the sports meet ended. Ma Duxue of the Municipal Education Bureau awarded the awards on behalf of the director. The ceremony was very grand. Each winning member was given a medal. The medal was made and donated by the Standard Sports Company, and the quality was excellent. The first place in each event was also awarded a satin flag by the association. Finally, graduation certificates were issued to the graduating members of the National Arts Department of the venue. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>

The hull is nearing completion and the launch ceremony is scheduled for the 12th of next month, coinciding with the Prime Minister's birthday.

The naval vessel supervision and construction department was instructed to commence construction a few days ago. The ship is planned to be 204 feet long, 26 feet wide, 11 feet 8 inches high, with a draft of 6 inches, a speed of 18 miles, and an armament of nine cannons, including one 4.7-inch bow gun, one 3-inch stern gun, two 6-pound side guns, four light machine guns, and one anti-aircraft gun. The crew will consist of 304 people, and the launch is scheduled for the Double Tenth Festival of the 20th year [of the Republic]. The Provincial Training Department Holds a Discussion Meeting in Shanghai The Provincial Training Director is Expected to Attend in Shanghai The Training Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Consolidation Committee has decided to guide and organize people's groups by district, and has designated Shanghai County as the central county for the first phase of district guidance in the fourth district. It is reported that a discussion meeting will be convened on the 21st of this month in Shanghai, gathering the training directors from the counties under the jurisdiction of the district to exchange opinions. Comrade Zhang Hantian, the provincial instructor, is expected to attend the meeting for guidance. It is also reported that Zhang Yuanyang, the Director of the Provincial Training Department, will also personally attend at that time. The County Consolidation Committee Appoints Guardians for Each District The Shanghai County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee, during its 52nd committee meeting, resolved the issue of appointing guardians for each district. Peng Yongkang was appointed for the first district, Gu Yunru for the second, Huang Xingrang for the third, Kang Qiang for the fourth, and He Shoumei for the fifth. It is understood that the appointment orders were issued by the committee yesterday, and the appointees have successively gone to take charge of their respective districts and are responsible for safekeeping. The County Propaganda Department Seeks Public Opinion The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai County Consolidation Committee previously requested the Provincial Propaganda Department to add a "People's Voice" column to the Jiangsu Party Affairs Weekly, which it publishes, so that the people of the entire province can express their opinions. The request has been approved by the province, and the department has been instructed to collect these opinions at any time for selection and publication. It is understood that the department has already issued a public notice, stating that any citizen of the county who has opinions regarding current politics, society, or anything else they wish to express, can submit them to the department at any time, and the department will forward them. The Provincial Office Orders the Suppression of Illegal Farmers' Organizations The Shanghai County Government received an order from the Jiangsu Agricultural and Mining Office, stating that, in order to comply with the matter, the Agricultural and Mining Department issued an order stating that the organizational plan for people's groups, as passed by the Second Plenary Session, stipulates that people's groups are divided into professional groups and social groups, and the organizational procedures have been promulgated by the National Government. It is now based on the rural survey forms filled out by various provinces, which include the organization of farmers' groups with various names such as the God Society, Sacrifice Society, Revolutionary Group, Three People's Principles Group, Renovation Group, Red Society, Yellow Society, Red and White Spears Society, and Sitting and Mountain Walking Groups. Since these organizations are freely organized without following the procedures stipulated by the central government, it is inevitable that there are unscrupulous elements within them. Their impact on rural areas is not insignificant. In addition to separate orders, the office urgently orders the bureau to instruct its subordinates that if there are organizations similar to the above, they should immediately, together with the local party headquarters, conduct detailed investigations and suppress them separately, and report the suppression situation for future reference. It is of utmost importance. The county magistrate is hereby ordered to immediately cooperate with the local party headquarters to implement the above, and to report the implementation situation for verification and transfer. Trade Associations Support the Implementation of Industry Regulations Meeting To Nominate Drafters for Drafting Dozens of trade associations, including the Seven Cities Intestine Industry, Bamboo Industry, Pharmaceutical Industry, Paper Industry, and Fresh Ice Industry, believe that the industry regulations approved for registration by the trade associations should be universally followed by all businesses in the industry, whether they are members of the association or not. Only in this way can the provisions of Article 2 of the Trade Association Law promulgated by the central government, which seek the common interests of the industry and correct industry malpractices, be effectively implemented. They gathered yesterday to discuss the matter and nominated drafters to prepare a draft to be submitted to the National Government. After further scheduled approval, it will be issued. Notice Soliciting Donations for the Family of Hu Bingxu The Shanghai Bar Association issued a notice to all members yesterday, stating that it received a letter from the family of the late Judge Hu Bingxu (also known as Tefu) of the Jiangsu Higher Court, stating that Mr. Hu served as a judicial officer with integrity that was known to all. He was diligent to the point of illness. Now that he has passed away, his family is impoverished. It is difficult to bury him in his hometown, and his family is finding it difficult to make ends meet. He left behind a widow and young children, and although they have received assistance from superiors and colleagues, it is not enough. They are appealing to all, whether they are close friends or simply admire his integrity, to show compassion and offer assistance. The letter includes a eulogy detailing Mr. Hu's integrity and dedication to justice during his life, which was admired by colleagues in both Shanghai and Jiangsu. His sudden passing is deeply regretted, and his family is in dire straits. It is appropriate to offer financial assistance. Therefore, the eulogy is enclosed and sent to all members, with the hope that they will generously contribute to help those in need. Donations should be sent to the association before November 15th. (The rest is omitted) The Crime of Soliciting Lawsuits, Fraud, and Attempted Acquisition of Property Zhang Zuotang Sentenced to Six Months of Imprisonment Zhang Zuochang, an assistant to lawyer Feng Kan at 600 North Shaanxi Road, repeatedly used the name of lawyer Zhang Guisan on April 7th, 8th, 15th, and 17th to demand payment of 370 taels of silver from Gongchang Embroidery Shop at 1259 Zhongde Lane, Beijing Road, on behalf of Yuanshun Seafood Shop. He then, in his capacity as the legal representative of Yuanshun Shop, filed a lawsuit against Gongchang Shop in the civil court of the Special District. After the court issued a summons, Yuanshun suddenly refused to accept it, stating that the shop had not engaged in any litigation with Gongchang. On June 16th and July 5th, the court held hearings. Zhang initially appeared in court under the name of Zhang Zuotang, then under his own name, and later under the name of lawyer Zhang Guisan. The Shanghai Bar Association learned of this and reported to Chief Prosecutor Zhou Xianjue of the Special Court, as there was no lawyer Zhang Guisan in the association. Zhou ordered lawyer Zhou Rubao Yi of the Public Works Department to investigate, and after obtaining substantial evidence, filed a public prosecution accusing Zhang of impersonating a lawyer and attempting to acquire property through fraud, a crime under Article 363, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. After several hearings by the Special Court, Zhang Zuotang claimed that Zhang Guisan was a Hangzhou lawyer and that he had a liaison office at his house and could represent all matters. The court ordered Zhang to pay 500 yuan bail to be released pending investigation and further hearings. Subsequently, the Special Court received a letter from a Hangzhou lawyer stating that he had not entrusted Zhang Zuotang to represent all matters. The case has been concluded by the court, and lawyer Ru requested that Zhang be severely punished. The judgment was announced yesterday morning by Judge Zhou in the first criminal court. The main text stated that Zhang Zuotang was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for the crime of soliciting lawsuits, fraud, and attempted acquisition of property. If the defendant is not satisfied with the judgment, he must file an appeal. Judge Zhou then ordered Zhang Zuotang to pay 700 yuan bail during the appeal period and await summons from the Court of Appeal. A Quarrel Between a Laborer and a Carpenter A Knife Wound to the Back Zhou Changan, a 22-year-old from Yangzhou, residing at 984 Huimin Yarn Factory, Yangshupu, was carrying tiles at the Shanghai Fifth Yarn Factory in Yangshupu around 10:00 yesterday morning when he had a quarrel with a carpenter. He was stabbed in the back with a knife by the carpenter, fell to the ground, and bled profusely. He was later sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by Constable Zhou. Qianlong's Tour of Jiangnan Accusation of Unauthorized Screening The Order to Reschedule the Retrial Tianyi Film Company rented the first, second, and third episodes of "Qianlong's Tour of Jiangnan" to Lin Lübing of Fujian in December of last year. The lease stipulated a period of sixty days. After the expiration, Lin colluded with Xu Daoyu of the Fuzhou Dahua Company to screen the films in various parts of Fujian Province without authorization. Upon hearing this, the company sent personnel to Fujian and found that the films were being screened in Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and other places. The company immediately reported this to the local company bureaus, and the films were seized. It is now known that Lin and Xu are in Shanghai, residing at the Central Hotel on Wuma Road. Tianyi Company reported this to the constables, who arrested Lin and Xu and filed charges of embezzlement and fraud with the Special Court. A preliminary hearing was held the day before yesterday afternoon, with lawyers from both sides presenting their cases. Due to the lateness of the hour, the hearing was rescheduled. Accusation of Infringement of Freedom Qu Hanqing, through his lawyer, claimed in the criminal court of the French Concession court that the plaintiff previously partnered with Yang Shunqing and Yang Siqing in a contracting business, with the plaintiff providing the funds and receiving the payments. A contract was signed as evidence. Subsequently, they contracted to build a house for a certain family. However, the defendants collected the payments and used them privately, disregarding the plaintiff's funds and ignoring his inquiries. The defendants are therefore guilty of embezzlement, and he requests an investigation and the recovery of his funds, totaling over 9,000 taels of silver. The defendant, Yang Siqing, through his lawyer Zhang Cang, argued that although his client initially partnered with the plaintiff, he was not involved in the handling of money. The funds he handled were only used to pay for minor expenses. His client declared his withdrawal from the partnership with the plaintiff and Yang Shunqing in August of last year. However, last month, the plaintiff falsely claimed to invite his client to a tea house and secretly arranged for a detective to take him to the police station for detention. This constitutes an infringement of freedom, and he requests compensation for the losses. Yang Shunqing, also through his lawyer, denied the embezzlement. The judge ordered a further review. Young Woman Requests Separate Residence Pending Judgment The Parties Cannot Reconcile Wu Hu, a young woman from Yangzhou, previously engaged a lawyer to sue her husband, Wu Jiegen, in the criminal court of the French Concession court, accusing him of neglecting his duty to provide support and of abusive behavior, and requesting permission to live separately and to receive alimony of 50,000 yuan. Another hearing was held the day before yesterday. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the previous instruction to attempt reconciliation had been unsuccessful, as the defendant showed no sincerity and never contacted the plaintiff for discussion. He therefore requested a judgment based on the plaintiff's request. The defendant's lawyer argued that the defendant had seven siblings and that the family property was managed by the eldest brother. The amount requested by the plaintiff was therefore difficult for the defendant to pay. The court noted that the parties could not reconcile and ordered a review pending judgment.

Tianxiang Tobacco Company Sues to Recover Losses Tianxiang Tobacco Company, through its lawyer, filed a criminal complaint in the French Concession Court, stating that in April of this year, the plaintiff purchased five barrels of American tobacco leaves from Lu Ziqing, the manager of Jinlong Tobacco Leaf Company, for a price of 800 taels plus 205 yuan. However, the defendant, Lu Ziqing, filled the American tobacco leaf barrels with inferior Chinese goods and sold them to the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not notice this at the time of purchase and used the leaves to make cigarettes, which were then shipped to other ports for sale. Subsequently, the plaintiff received numerous letters of complaint from customers, which greatly impacted the plaintiff's business. The plaintiff used to use the best American tobacco leaves to manufacture cigarettes under the names of Aiman, Yuman, Hongxing, and Baojian, with an average monthly sales volume of over 300 cartons, each with a profit of 7 yuan, totaling 2,100 yuan. Since the use of the defendant's inferior goods, the plaintiff has suffered significant losses. The defendant is therefore guilty of the crime of breach of trust under Article 363 of the Criminal Law, and the plaintiff requests an investigation and the recovery of 100,000 yuan in damages. The defendant, Lu Ziqing, also through his lawyer, argued that Jinlong Tobacco Leaf Company is a US-owned company and that the transactions were conducted directly between the manager and the plaintiff. The defendant has no relationship with the matter and is merely a comprador who earns commissions and is not responsible for the quality of the goods. Judge Zhu ordered the defendant, Lu Ziqing, to provide a reliable guarantor for his release and to await the appointment of an accountant to investigate the actual losses suffered by the plaintiff before further hearing.

Due to its impact on this port, in addition to the heavy thunderstorms before dawn (around 2:00 or 3:00 yesterday morning), there was also a strong wind in the early morning, blowing fiercely eastward. In the afternoon, the wind became even stronger, with a howling sound that did not subside until dawn. The weather turned cold, and it was already chilly to wear a jacket. According to a report from the Yangjingbang Observatory yesterday afternoon, the center of the hurricane had reached the north of the mouth of the Yangtze River, and its trend was towards the northeast and east, continuing with low pressure.

Zhao Congzhang Commits Suicide Due to Pessimism Unlimited Complaints in His Suicide Note It Must Be Due to Nervous Stimulation Zhao Congzhang, a student in the training class of the Ministry of Communications Telegraph School on Wangjia Pier Road in the South City of this port, suffered from nervous disorders and often felt pessimistic about life. On the 13th of this month, he once attempted to commit suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River, but was rescued by the guards at Guan Bridge and survived. However, on the morning of the 15th, he disappeared again. His colleagues at the school, fearing that the same thing would happen again, sent letters to the water and land police authorities to inquire and investigate his whereabouts. Last night, the school received a phone call from the Nanmatou Lifesaving Bureau, stating that Zhao's body had floated to the surface of the Huangpu River and had been recovered. They requested that someone come to identify the body. The school sent personnel to identify the body, which was confirmed to be Zhao. Thus, the mystery of Zhao Congzhang's disappearance was solved. The details of the student's suicide are recorded as follows: Family Situation Zhao was 25 years old, from Hepu County, Guangdong Province. He graduated from the county high school. His father had passed away early, but his mother was still alive. His elder brother, Congwen, is currently the director of the Bengbu Telegraph Bureau. The family is moderately well-off and can live comfortably. After graduating from high school, Zhao did not have a suitable career for a while. Therefore, he was introduced by his elder brother to practice reporting at the Telegraph Bureau for three years. Entering the Telegraph Industry In recent years, the transportation authorities, in order to rectify the telegraph administration, have formulated methods for identifying and examining telegraph students from various bureaus. Those who have not passed the examination will not be employed. Although Zhao had been working at the Telegraph Bureau for several years, he had not passed the examination and did not meet the requirements. This summer, the bureau reported him to the ministry, and after being identified and examined in the four regions of Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan, the ministry considered him to be promising. He was ordered to go to the Telegraph School for half a year of supplementary study before a decision was made on whether to retain him. Social Stimulation Over the years, Zhao served in the telegraph industry. In his spare time, he often discussed social, political, economic, and occupational issues with his colleagues. Seeing the darkness of society, the corruption of politics, the lack of occupational security, and the instability of life, he was greatly stimulated psychologically, and his nerves became weak. The idea of being pessimistic about life arose spontaneously. Since entering the school this summer, he has been influenced by new ideas, which has increased his sadness. He deeply felt that the great China was in a state of civil war all year round, the people were suffering, the country was in turmoil, and the telegraph industry was on the verge of bankruptcy. He thought it was useless to live and not worth regretting to die. On the morning of the 13th, he left a letter and left the school. Decided to Commit Suicide He wandered around Guan Bridge and Huangpu riverside. When the guards saw that he intended to commit suicide, they immediately rescued him and escorted him back to school. The school authorities and classmates persuaded him, but Zhao was determined to die. At 5:00 am on the 15th, he left his residence wearing a yellow sports shirt and pants and did not return all night. His colleagues became suspicious and sent letters to the water and land police authorities to pay attention to the search. Yesterday, the Lifesaving Bureau telegraphed that the second suicide had resulted in death. The bad news spread, and all the colleagues at the school deeply regretted it. The school telegraphed the student's family to send someone to Shanghai to handle the funeral arrangements. It is reported that they also plan to hold a memorial service. Contents of the Suicide Note Zhao was stimulated by society, which led him to commit suicide. The suicide note contained more than a thousand words, and the words were full of anger and leaped on the paper. Excerpts of the key points are as follows: "Today's world is declining, people's hearts are not ancient, the country is in turmoil, the people are suffering, the social system is full of miasma, private affairs are important, public affairs are light, politics are corrupt, the economy is bankrupt, the telegraph industry is becoming more dangerous, there is no occupational security, and life is unstable. My seven-foot body, Zhao Congzhang, is useless to live and not worth regretting to die. Instead of stealing life, it is better to die. I am dead, I am determined to die. Although my body is dead, my expectations for the improvement of society are even greater. I hope that the Chinese people will be alerted by my death, rise up and catch up, improve society, enrich people's livelihood, so that political clarity and national independence can be realized. There is great hope," and so on. A Batch of Military Supplies Found in the Wilderness In Lukiazai, Pudong There Were Rifles and Bullets Next to the Taitong Depot on North Hutang Road, Lukiazai, Pudong, there is an open space of dozens of acres. The place is near the Huangpu River, and there are no people around. Wild grass grows thickly, reaching several feet high. The Lijie small wheel robbery case occurred in the former Huangpu Bureau, and the robbers entered and exited from here. Therefore, the Third District of the Public Security Bureau paid close attention and sent long patrols to scout around from time to time. Around 1:00 yesterday afternoon, Inspector Fan Zhongliang of the district led a long patrol and went deep into the grass to investigate. Suddenly, a batch of military supplies was found, including six Mauser rifles (their color and style were similar to the rifles used</p>

<p>Last Week’s Gold Market Still Favorable, Appropriate Value Swap Period, Major Players Strongly Raised Prices</p>
<p>Last week's gold market situation experienced slight changes, initially weak then firm. Coinciding with the swap period, the December market has opened, with bullish parties actively buying in, comparatively higher than last month. Prices were pushed up to 9 taels and some change, greatly stimulating the bearish side as they were pressured by major bullish players. Tracing back to the October period, reaching every three-month mark, premiums of over 30 taels have actually been posted. As for October market prices, they softened from firm at the start of the week, finally falling to 60 taels and 9 mace on October 14th (Tuesday). By Thursday (the swap day), it had risen to 73 and a half taels. Within these four days, the difference amounted to 12 taels and 6 mace. However, the closing price was 68 taels and 4 mace, an increase of 2 taels and 7 mace compared to last Saturday (October 11th).</p>
<p>The December market started trading from the 16th, but due to the swap-induced price increase, it was lower than November. The opening price was 63 taels and 8 mace. Later, due to sales by major players such as Yu Dafu, Xingyong, etc., it suddenly plummeted to 57 taels and 2 mace, entering a fluctuating pattern. However, generally, bearish parties were eager to buy back in, and by the weekend, it had already surged past the 70 tael mark. Nonetheless, there was also a 13 tael and 4 mace retracement within those three days. The final result was 70 taels and 6 mace, an increase of 6 taels and 8 mace compared to the first day's opening price.</p>
<p>However, there were no special news in the overseas silver market. Foreign silver bars increased by .0625 compared to the previous Saturday, with a total fluctuation of only .1875. The American silver market was balanced, with a fluctuation of .375. Exchange rates for sterling were level, and Japanese exchange rates decreased by only .25, contrasting with the gold market and almost becoming a divergence.</p>
<p>In summary, gold prices were forcibly raised by major players during the swap period. According to investigations, among the firms, bullish parties such as the Dalian group held approximately over 1,000 contracts, Fuchang, Yuanheng approximately 10,000 contracts, Yufeng Yong six to seven thousand contracts, Chengfeng Yong three to four thousand contracts. Bearish parties included Dadecheng with approximately 6,000 contracts, Yuanxing, Yongtai, Kangrun, Taixing, Hongxing, etc., also belonged to the bearish side, while Hengxing Shengda was rumored to have switched from bullish to bearish. The total amount of swap contracts for this period was 46,000 to 47,000, with over 10,000 contracts yet to be settled. As for the gold collateral, according to the daily gold quotation, it was initially pressed around 50 taels, but by the weekend, it was only pressed at over 40 taels. The existing bare gold bar market had limited inventory. Term collateral was approximately 18 to 19 taels higher. The following is a record of the situation throughout the week.</p>
<p>The Market Shape Shifts from Weak to Strong with Slight Ups and Downs</p>
<p>Starting on Monday, October 13th, the initial opening price for the November gold collateral increased by 2 taels and 8 mace, to 68 and a half taels. Due to the large contract decrease, confidence improved. Afterwards, major players divested, with Hengxing, Shengda, Yuansheng, etc. leaning towards selling, and almost a 6 tael drop in the afternoon. The exchange market also seemed to loosen, so the resulting price was 1 tael and 8 mace lower than the previous Saturday. The next day, large contracts increased by 0.125, silver prices were inactive, and exchange rates increased by half a grade. Internal conditions were also weak, so the gold market fell to 60 taels and 9 mace in the morning session, then turned slightly peaceful, with the afternoon session closing at 64 taels. On this day, the fluctuation was only 3 taels and 6 mace.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, large contracts slightly increased, exchange rates were stable, and with the swap period approaching, bearish parties bought in, causing the demand to exceed supply in the market, pushing prices to 70 taels in the afternoon. In particular, fellow firms had already pre-arranged swaps, initially with bullish parties offering a premium of 6 taels, then 6 and a half to 5 and a half taels, and later transactions at 6 taels, raising the market price. The closing price was 69 taels and 6 mace, an increase of 5 taels and 6 mace compared to the previous day, with a difference of 5 taels and 9 mace between the morning and afternoon sessions.</p>
<p>The following day, the silver market was slightly lower, and internal exchange rates showed firmness. However, banks' willingness to sell remained unabated. The gold market coincided with the swap period, initially with bearish parties offering a premium of 7 taels, then gradually raising it, reaching over 9 taels, and even nearing 10 taels. The result was 9 taels, which was raised by powerful major players. The general bearish parties were in a pessimistic state. Compelled by the environment, they had no choice but to suffer a painful blow. The November market had no more transactions. The initial December contract was 63 taels and 8 mace, followed by 4 taels. Then, due to Yu Dafu, Xingyong, Hengxing, Dadecheng, etc., leaning towards selling, it suddenly dropped to 57 taels and 2 mace, breaking the 60 tael mark. However, in the afternoon session, Yuancheng, Jinan, Daixinheng covered short positions, and Taixing, etc., followed suit, resulting in a surge of 6 to 7 taels, reaching 65 taels and 8 mace, with a slight one or two tael fluctuation afterwards, closing at 4 mace and 8 mace, with a total retracement of 8 taels and 6 mace in one day.</p>
<p>The next day, large contracts did not change, and silver prices increased, so the initial collateral market was weak. With no movement in the United States, the silver market was mediocre, opening at 62 taels. Later, major players sold, retreating to 58 taels and 8 mace. Then, major players stepped out, rising by 3 taels. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Taixing, Dadecheng, etc., divested, once dropping by 3 taels, reaching 60 taels and 4 mace, immediately rebounding by 1 tael. However, it was still 3 taels and 1 mace lower than the previous day. The market situation was exceptionally uncertain, seemingly in a fluctuating state.</p>
<p>On Saturday, although large contracts increased, silver prices did not change, and private telegrams were lower. With indecision in Japan and the United States, the gold market did not weaken. Afterwards, Yu Da covered short positions for clients, and Zhifeng, Yongfeng, Taikangrun, etc., also followed suit. With sterling reducing by half a grade and internal conditions also tight, there was a strong desire for change, suddenly surging through the 70 tael mark, resulting in 70 taels and 6 mace, and then rising beyond 70 taels. Major bullish players had considerable pulling power, but no one dared to go short, fearing suppression. Therefore, it was 8 taels and 9 mace higher than the previous day, with a large difference of 10 taels in half a day.</p>
<p>In general, the volume of listed contracts was limited, and bullish parties were quite optimistic. The following is a table of high and low prices for the British, American, and Indian silver markets and exchange rates.</p>
<p>| Category   | Highest       | Lowest        | Change from Last Saturday |</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<p>Last Week's Bond Prices Fluctuated and Trended Weaker</p>
<p>1929 Customs Duty Bonds Fell by 5 Yuan, Demobilization Bonds Fell by a Little Over 1 Yuan</p>
<p>Other bonds remained stable, with a total transaction volume of 40.02 million yuan.</p>
<p>The trading volume of various government bonds in the securities market was low last week, with a total volume of only 67,4800 yuan. This included 29,000 yuan of Reorganization Bonds, 16,000 yuan of 1919 Tobacco Bonds, and approximately 8,000 yuan each of Consolidation 6% and 7-Year Bonds. Other bonds had transaction volumes of only a few thousand yuan each. The futures market was also as calm as before. The number of buyers and sellers in the market each day was even lower than before, as the overall environment was gloomy and major players were adopting a wait-and-see approach, resulting in very few transactions. Investigations revealed that the transaction volume was over 8.7 million yuan for the first two days of the week, 5.7 million yuan on Wednesday, and only over 4 million yuan on Friday, the quietest day. Saturday was slightly better, with a transaction volume of over 7.1 million yuan. The total transaction volume for the week was 40.02 million yuan, approximately 2 million yuan less than the previous week. Demobilization Bonds remained relatively active, while Reorganization and Customs Duty Bonds were very calm. The trading of 1919 Customs Duty Bonds was relatively lively, and 96 Bonds were also not inactive. However, other bonds remained scarce.</p>
<p>The volume of Demobilization Bonds was 4.715 million yuan for the October term and 7.265 million yuan for the November term. The volume of 1919 Customs Duty Bonds was 3.09 million yuan for the October term and 6.725 million yuan for the November term. The volume of Reorganization Bonds was 3.405 million yuan for the October term and 3.41 million yuan for the November term. The volume of 96 Bonds was 1.325 million yuan for the October term and 2.72 million yuan for the November term. The volume of Customs Duty Bonds was 2.01 million yuan for the October term and 2.02 million yuan for the November term. The volume of 1919 Tobacco Bonds was 1.02 million yuan for the October term and 750,000 yuan for the November term. The volume of Rehabilitation Bonds was 450,000 yuan for the October term and 365,000 yuan for the November term. The volume of Consolidation 6% Bonds was 300,500 yuan for the October term and 340,000 yuan for the November term. The volume of 7-Year Bonds was only 55,000 yuan. The volume of Continued Tobacco Bonds was 90,000 yuan, and the volume of Financial Bonds was 130,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the fluctuations of various bonds last week, with the exception of 1919 Customs Duty Bonds, other government bonds remained very stagnant, with daily fluctuations of only a few jiao, without any significant declines. The bond market environment was calm, and the financial situation was stable, so major buyers and sellers were adopting a wait-and-see approach, resulting in a very balanced supply and demand. The bond prices were therefore in a state of neither rising nor falling. However, 1919 Customs Duty Bonds were actively sold by major players on Monday, with a sharp decline of over 3 yuan. On Tuesday, they declined by approximately 1 yuan, and although they rose by approximately 0.49 jiao later, they still declined by approximately 1 yuan by the end of the week. Because 1919 Customs Duty Bonds were recently issued, although there were active sellers in the market, investors had not yet paid close attention to them.</p>
<p>As a result, compared to the previous week, 1919 Customs Duty Bond futures fell by 5 yuan, spot prices fell by 3.5 yuan, Demobilization Bond spot prices fell by a little over 2.3 yuan, and futures also fell by a little over 1 yuan. Other bonds also weakened slightly, with declines of approximately 0.5 yuan. The following is a statistical table of the high and low prices and fluctuations of various bonds during the past week (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>American Cotton Slightly Turns Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was calm and uneventful, initially firm due to fears of frost, then weakened due to sales in the South. Futures prices fluctuated by 1 to 2 points, and spot prices increased by 5 points. British cotton futures and spot prices both increased by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. The Indian cotton market was stable, with Pingguoer and Bailuoxi down by 1 rupee, and Yue Mula down by 2 rupees.</p>

<p>Food and Grains</p>
<p>Rice Market Decline Slightly Stabilizes</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, over thirty rice boats arrived at inner wharves, and sales activity turned slightly active. High-quality new japonica rice saw a decrease of two jiao, opening at 15.3 yuan. Medium and lower grades generally experienced no fluctuations, as high-quality japonica rice had increased significantly recently, while medium and lower grades had seen larger price reductions. Therefore, the market stabilized, and the situation immediately changed. Although the japonica market has now stabilized, it is still not easy to gain a firm foothold. The arrival and sales of thin rice were balanced, and prices remained unchanged. Indica rice and wharf-picked rice gradually became consistent, with very low sales volumes and inactive customer routes. The arrival of foreign rice impeded progress, making the market quite sluggish.</p>
<p>Large Market: After the revision of the jiao, the Dujian market has stabilized, with brisk retail sales and a slightly stable market. High-quality goods were at 11.9 yuan. After the previous sharp decline in guest indica rice, shipments from the producing areas to Shanghai were scarce, so there was no sign of excessive price reductions. In fact, rice around 9.5 yuan meets the demands of the civilian market. Although old white rice has stabilized, due to the presence of new rice, buying interest is extremely sluggish. Therefore, prices have not softened, but the market has already weakened. Yin yuan opened at 14 jiao. The rice market throughout the day had a fluctuating trend.</p>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, sources arrived continuously downstream, but sales were sluggish. New Changbang japonica rice continued to trend downward, opening at around 15 yuan. Some inquiries were made about Sutong white japonica rice from Chongming and Tongzhou, but these were only scattered transactions, and prices softened by about two jiao. Top-quality goods are approaching the 14 yuan mark. The situation for thin rice and white rice from Nanbang Jiaoli Qingpu Chonggu Sijing, etc., was quite calm. In past years, japonica and thin rice prices have generally been comparable, but this time there is a large disparity, so people generally hope that thin rice may stabilize. Indica and Dujian rice continue to soften, due to a lack of inquiries and sluggish buying interest. High-quality goods can still be maintained, while lower grades saw small price reductions of about a jiao. The state of the japonica and indica rice markets here has stabilized. In general, the arrival and sales of Yin yuan were sluggish, and the overall market slightly recovered by one jiao, with high Yin yuan opening at 14 yuan.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Minghua Factory's Shipments Expected Soon, Japanese Sugar Prices Likely to Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received telegrams from the producing areas. As it was Sunday, no telegrams arrived. At the market, quotations were flat, and transactions were very low. Shipments of No. 24 Dutch coarse granulated white sugar were quite plentiful, with asking prices at 7 taels 8 mace and a half, and slightly higher prices at 7 taels 9 mace. Inquiries were quiet, and some buyers had slight interest, but their bidding prices were low, so no transactions occurred. The market for medium granulated white sugar was very abundant, and the trend was weaker, with a general sense of abundant supply and no demand. No. 8 Dutch red sugar was at 6 taels 3 mace. Although activity was sluggish, the market remained strong. N mark Japanese sugar was at 7 taels 8 mace, and YT mark was at 7 taels 7 mace, with demand also quiet. YP mark was at 8 taels, with prices firm due to shortages. J mark was at 8 taels 1 mace and a half, an increase of 5 fen from the previous time, and the market was brisk. However, Minghua Factory is scheduled to start production today, and shipments are expected soon. At a time when sales are sluggish, the future trend has a pessimistic outlook.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: New Red and Black Dates Arriving Gradually</p>
<p>The first batch of genuine new Tianjin red dates only arrived in twenty or so packages. As the first buyers had sold them at 14 taels to establish a base price, the second batch of over a thousand packages arrived the day before yesterday via Xin Feng and Shun Tian ships. It was reported yesterday that they had already been released, with the best top-quality dates opening at 12 taels 6 mace. The next two to three grades were priced at 9 taels 6 mace to 7 taels 6 mace, and the subsequent ones at 12 taels 4 mace to 11 taels 4 mace, with the two to three grades priced at 8 taels to 6 taels. If more arrive in the future, there is hope for price declines.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the Guangzhou and Xinjiang ships Guang Sheng and Xinjiang each brought approximately 3,000 packages of new black dates, mostly in the upper and middle grades. However, at present, sales in various merchant groups are most active for the lower grades. For example, the Fujian groups of Xinghua and Quanzhou recently sold 500 to 600 packages, and the sales volume of the Wenzhou and Taizhou groups was also considerable. Therefore, market prices have increased by 5 to 6 qian compared to before.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<p>Silk Market: Silk Market Gradually Showing Vitality</p>
<p>Jiangzhe Silk Factories Suspend Operations, Silk Production Decreases Daily, European Sales Begin</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Maintain High Prices, Factory Prices Tend to Increase Sharply</p>
<p>Last week, the silk market in Shanghai saw a gradual turnaround. As silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces successively announced the suspension of operations, silk production decreased daily, and hoarders began to accumulate stocks. Overseas silk weaving factories also showed a tendency to purchase both futures and spot silk. In the first half of the week, European and American telegrams were still slow to reach Shanghai. Only a few firms took the opportunity to make progress. However, manufacturers, facing scarce raw materials and high costs for their existing silk stocks, are currently petitioning the government for relief funds, adopting a passive attitude and insisting on high prices before selling, resulting in increasingly few transactions.</p>
<p>By the second half of the week, European sales of Yokohama Japanese silk had begun, and silk prices gradually increased by ten to twenty yen per day. By the weekend, European and American telegrams to Shanghai factories became more frequent and smooth, and various firms began to seek supplies, causing the market to suddenly become active. Factory prices have the potential to increase sharply. Unfortunately, silk supplies remain insufficient, and most of the silk stocks held by factories are in the hands of financial institutions, making it difficult to expect a rapid increase in transactions.</p>
<p>The total transaction volume for the week was approximately 200 packages of silk futures and spot goods. The actual volume of raw silk shipped out was over 700 packages. The prices of overseas Chinese silk generally followed the trend of rising Yokohama Japanese silk, but were still relatively flat and weak in the first half of the week.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<p>New Iron Wire Prices Increase by 5 Qian</p>
<p>The current sales of No. 16 to No. 20 new iron wire are very brisk in the Yangtze River merchant groups, and are also gaining popularity in the Fujian merchant groups. Over one hundred barrels have been sold in recent days, but the remaining inventory is very low. Therefore, confidence is high, and the standard price has increased by 5 qian, currently selling for 12 taels 5 qian. However, the actual opening price is 12 taels 2 or 3 qian. In addition, the asking price for No. 21 to No. 25 iron wire is 13 taels 2 qian and a half.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Yesterday Morning Bandits Murdered on Beijing-Shanghai Train <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Train Staff Member Died in the Line of Duty</p>
<p>The Culprit Has Been Captured</p>
<p>At approximately 1:40 AM yesterday morning, the 28th night express train from Beijing to Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai line, while approaching the Zhenjiang mountain cave, was moving extremely slowly due to the uphill gradient. Suddenly, a person dressed in military uniform and wielding a handgun, resembling a bandit, jumped onto the train guard's carriage. The train guard, Chang Rongli, and the accompanying luggage clerk, Zhu Chungan, realizing this was no good person, and given the carriage's status as an official vehicle and its limited space, repeatedly and politely asked him to get off the train, but he ignored them. The train guard and others, seeing him unreasonable, declared they would notify the military police on the front train to come and remove him. Unexpectedly, this statement offended him. In desperation, he immediately drew his handgun and fired five shots at the staff. The luggage clerk was the most severely wounded, struck by a bullet that entered his left cheek and exited his right neck, causing an immediate and profuse flow of blood, rendering him unconscious. The train guard sustained a graze wound to his left shoulder, which was not serious. After the incident, the bandit jumped off the train between Danyang and Xinfeng stations and fled. However, passengers and other government personnel, as well as the escorting military police, did not hear anything due to the train being in motion and the loud noise. It was not until the train reached Danyang station that the incident was discovered. A telegram was immediately sent to the Seventh Company of the Second Battalion of the First Regiment of the National Government Guard Brigade stationed at Xinfeng station, requesting troops to search and arrest the perpetrator. Simultaneously, a telegram was urgently sent to Changzhou station, requesting the preparation of a medical car to transport the severely injured luggage clerk to Wujin Hospital for treatment overnight. Unfortunately, due to the critical nature of the wound, excessive blood loss, and the jolting of the train, he could not be saved and died at the hospital at 6:00 AM yesterday morning. It was also learned that the perpetrator had been captured by the stationed troops near Yangqi outside Xinfeng station at approximately 7:00 AM yesterday morning and is currently under interrogation. The train guard, having sustained minor injuries, continued with the train to Shanghai to report the facts of the incident. However, as yesterday was a Sunday, all departments were on holiday, so the Railway Bureau has not yet determined how to handle the case or the compensation for the deceased staff member.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Difficulties for Chinese Citizens Going Abroad <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Dutch Government Increases Head Tax on Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Associations Request Serious Government Negotiations</p>
<p>There are over 1.8 million Chinese people residing in the Dutch East Indies. In the late Qing Dynasty, Chinese people could reach those lands with just a few tens of dollars due to competition among commercial ships, which made fares extremely low. Passport fees and other expenses were also minimal. Consequently, many poor and hardworking people from the southeastern coast went to the Dutch East Indies to make a living. In the early years of the Republic of China, the Dutch government, in order to limit the entry of Chinese, imposed a head tax of 25 guilders (each guilder equivalent to 1.5 Chinese dollars) on each Chinese immigrant upon landing, calling it a "dock tax." In 1919, it added another 25 guilders, and in 1923, another 50 guilders. In total, each person going to the Dutch East Indies had to pay a dock tax of 100 guilders, plus over a hundred dollars for ship fare and passport, requiring a self-provided 400 Chinese dollars to leave the country. In April of this year, the Dutch Colonial Council resolved to further increase the head tax on overseas Chinese by 50 guilders. At the time, Lin Youren, a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the National Government, petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to order the Consul-General in Java to negotiate strictly with the Dutch government. As a result, the Dutch government agreed to postpone the matter. However, in June, the Dutch Colonial Council reintroduced the old proposal and resolved that, starting from January 1, 1931, immigrants from the Far East would have to pay an additional 50 guilders in dock tax per person. Since approximately 200,000 Chinese people travel to the Dutch East Indies each year, each paying a dock tax of 150 guilders (equivalent to 225 Chinese dollars), the Dutch government could collect a total of 45 million Chinese dollars in dock taxes annually, a staggering sum. With Chinese people burdened by such significant taxes, they will be hesitant to proceed, and the poor in the country will have no opportunity to go abroad to make a living. The Shanghai General Association of Overseas Chinese Federations has petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate seriously with the Dutch government, urging them to revoke the resolution to increase the dock tax. The association recently received telegram number 282 from the Ministry, stating: "To the Overseas Chinese Federation, we have received your telegram. The Consul-General in Java replied via telegram, stating that it is not limited to immigrants from the Far East; all countries in Europe and America are treated equally. The Ministry, considering the significant impact on overseas Chinese, has instructed the embassy in Japan and the Consul-General in Java to continue negotiations separately, and has also informed the Chinese embassy in Japan, requesting them to ask the Japanese government to fundamentally revoke the original proposal. We are replying." The Overseas Chinese Association believes that although the Dutch government's increase in head tax on overseas Chinese applies equally to all countries in Europe and America, there are over 1.8 million Chinese residing in the Dutch East Indies, while only about 4,000 Japanese reside there, and only a few hundred people from the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, it held a special meeting yesterday (the 19th) morning and decided to submit another petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting the implementation of revolutionary diplomacy, and sending telegrams to the ambassadors and consuls in The Hague and Java, urging them to quickly unite with the ambassadors and consuls of other countries to protest the Dutch Colonial Council's resolution to increase the immigration tax for immigrants from the Far East to 150 guilders per person, in order to achieve the fundamental goal of cancellation. Because the number of our people residing there is higher than in any other country, our ambassadors and consuls should take the lead and unite with the ambassadors and consuls of other countries to protest together.</p>

<p>Important Notice from the Council of the Shanghai Rice and Grain Industry Workers' Union (Posted in Shops on October 19)</p>
<p>Notice Regarding the Serious Matter of Resisting the Sale of Japanese Rice in Shops: After investigating the case of opposing Japan's self-serving and harmful economic invasion policy, which involves hoarding large quantities of rice in warehouses and transporting it to China for sale, plundering the interests of our country's farmers, industrialists, and merchants, Sun Zhentong has advised rice merchants and requested authorities to resist, as reported in various newspapers in recent days. Furthermore, according to the instructions of the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, Chinese people are not allowed to purchase Japanese rice. Rice merchant leaders, the Guild, the Jiagu Association, and the Rice Milling Association have successively expressed their strict opposition, issuing notices that no one is allowed to mill or sell Japanese rice. We believe that this matter concerns the livelihood of the people and is a foreign disaster. Our union members, serving in the industry, cannot shirk our responsibility. Our patriotic hearts will not fall behind others. We should exercise our freedom of speech and reasonably advise shop owners, managers, and those in charge to unanimously resist and never sell Japanese rice. If anyone is unpersuaded, found to be selling Japanese rice, or violating the ban, we urge you to investigate and report them secretly so that we can expose and punish the traitors. Those who conceal information will be equally liable. This notice is specifically to inform members to strictly prevent, supervise, and advise, and not to feign compliance, lest they commit a crime. This notice is to be shown to all comrades in your establishment.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Zhejiang Silk Cocoon Merchants Request Refusal to Purchase Japanese Cocoons <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Letter to the Silk Factory Trade Association</p>
<p>The case of Japanese cocoons entering the country has attracted the attention of all sectors of the country. Zhejiang Province cocoon merchants, specifically for this matter, organized the All-Zhejiang Cocoon Industry Association Federation to discuss countermeasures, which held its first meeting in Shanghai on the previous Sunday. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, the association, using the name of Zhejiang silk factories, sent a letter to the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association, asking it to forward the message to all silk factories in Shanghai to not purchase Japanese cocoons for silk reeling in order to save Chinese cocoons. The original letter is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, the purchasing and transporting of Japanese cocoons by the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Cocoon General Association is an invasion of our country's silk cocoon sales and is extremely harmful. Letters and telegrams have been sent, calling and running around, even though our tongues have been parched, and those who speak are earnestly trying to persuade while those who listen are indifferent. We have neither the ability to urge the government to awaken and stop this, nor the financial resources to maintain the suspension of the cocoon industry. The only plan for now is to ask our silk factory colleagues to not purchase Japanese cocoons for silk reeling. There are two reasons for this: (1) We Chinese people should support Chinese goods and purchase Chinese cocoons, in order to show a little patriotism. (2) The sales of Chinese silk have not been extensive recently and it is difficult to compete. The quality of the work is not good, which cannot be denied, but the reason why it can still be exported and occupy a portion of the market is thanks to its natural beauty (tough quality and smooth color). Now, if Japanese cocoons are mixed in, on the one hand, its beauty will be lost, and on the other hand, the work will not be as good as the Japanese. Once it cannot be trusted or exported, it will be too late to regret. Silk merchants and cocoon merchants will perish together, and China's sericulture industry will also be in a desperate situation. A small spark can start a prairie fire. The urgency of the situation requires immediate action. This association proposes the above, and hopes that you will carefully consider it."</p>

<h3 id="e107">Merrell Sails for Hong Kong Today <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Consulting with the Hong Kong Government</p>
<p>On Matters Such as Anti-Smuggling and Taxation</p>
<p>Mr. Merrell, the Inspector General of Customs, traveled to Hong Kong last winter to consult with the Hong Kong government authorities on the establishment of tax collection and anti-smuggling agencies in Hong Kong, and has obtained substantial understanding. However, the terms were not consistent. There was a proposal for a second trip to Hong Kong this spring, but unexpectedly, the Central Plains War broke out after the travel dates were set. Merrell was unable to leave Shanghai due to heavy responsibilities. Now that the war has ended and the situation has been renewed, the matter cannot be delayed. Therefore, it was decided that he would depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong this Monday to negotiate in person. Since the implementation of our country's new tariff, foreign goods have been taxed heavily, and merchants are engaging in more smuggling than before in order to avoid heavy taxation. Moreover, Hong Kong and Guangdong are close at hand, and prevention should be approached from both sides, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve results. The Hong Kong authorities already understand this point, but the British side seems to have made excessive demands on the terms, so the matter was interrupted. Now that our country's domestic turmoil has been quelled, the central government is consolidated, and its international status has increased accordingly. All diplomacy is easier to handle than before, so Merrell's trip south this time is very optimistic.</p>

<p>Mediation by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau implemented the public weight inspection of export factory silk on a trial basis six months ago, silk factories in Shanghai and Wuxi have suffered considerable losses and have appealed for its cancellation. The bureau has refused, leading to a strike by silk factories to protest. It is learned that the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has stated that the public weight inspection of export silk is being carried out under the orders of the ministry and that the bureau has no authority to abolish it. It has reported the situation to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for instructions. The manufacturers have also petitioned the ministry to cancel the inspection to comply with public opinion. While both sides are awaiting instructions from the ministry, the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously invited both sides to a meeting to mediate. Zou Bingwen, director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, Miao Zhongxiu, director of the silk inspection department, Shen Huachen, chairman of the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association, Zhu Jingan, standing committee member, and Huang Jinzhen, chairman of the Silk Cocoon General Association, were all in attendance. As a result of the mediation by the chairman (of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce) Wang Xiaolai, it was decided to devise a better solution so that silk merchants would no longer suffer unexpected losses. It is expected that this matter can be resolved peacefully.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Abolition of Tobacco Leaf Brokerage <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The original plan to maintain that provinces and cities should not arbitrarily levy taxes should be upheld</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "On the 17th of this month, according to a letter from the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Industry Association, 'Our member, Huacheng Tobacco Company, reported in a letter from our assistant, Shen Xingde, from Tanfangzi, Qingzhou, that after arriving there to purchase tobacco leaves, Tanfang and Yangjiazhuang are both under the jurisdiction of Yidu County. Now, a broker named Zhang Zhiquan has fabricated a reason and presented it to the Yidu County government, announcing the collection of a 2% brokerage fee on buying and selling, which is actually a burden on merchants and the people. Moreover, after investigating the many areas along the route that produce tobacco leaves, why is Yidu County the only one that is different? All merchants believe that it is illegal. British and American tobacco merchants have gone to Qingdao to negotiate and have stopped bidding, and all our Chinese merchants are also stopping bidding and handling the matter in the same way, pending resolution. The county's announcement is enclosed for your information, and we request that you promptly report to the association, which will relay the situation to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and then telegraph the government and the Ministry of Finance to negotiate seriously and order the Shandong province to issue an order to the county to immediately cancel the brokerage fee so that merchants can transport their goods smoothly,' We at the company further verified that the tax burden on tobacco merchants is already very heavy, so how can they bear further extortion and exploitation? Therefore, this special letter, along with a copy of Yidu's announcement, is sent to your association for investigation. We earnestly request that you promptly forward it to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to relay it to the central government and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that they approve the telegraph order to the province to cancel this brokerage fee to maintain commerce and facilitate transportation. We hope that you will implement this quickly and provide us with a reply.'" A copy of the announcement from the Yidu County government was enclosed. After investigation, the goods within the scope of national tax collection should not be subject to any donations or taxes without the approval of the ministry, which has been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be strictly followed by the financial authorities of all provinces and cities. Tobacco tax is one of the national taxes, and local agencies absolutely cannot impose additional donations, which is beyond doubt. Now, Tanfangzi, which belongs to Yidu County in Shandong, actually has tobacco leaf brokerage agents similar to contractors who, under the pretext of being recognized for paying taxes, have requested the collection of a 2% brokerage fee on the buying and selling of tobacco leaves. The Yidu County government has even publicly announced its approval, disregarding the ministry's orders, arbitrarily increasing the burden on tobacco merchants, making it impossible to promote national tobacco leaves to the fullest extent, destroying the tax system, and increasing the burden on merchants. This is the worst of all. Therefore, we enclose a copy of the Yidu County announcement and request that your department verify and quickly issue a telegraph order to cancel the brokerage fee on tobacco leaves to relieve the people's difficulties by means of government orders.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Please Exempt Taiping Tea from Miscellaneous Taxes <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>National Goods Association Submits a Letter to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Sun Fuxian, a tea merchant from Taiping, Anhui, residing in Shanghai, stated that when Taiping tea is transported to Beijing, in addition to paying regular taxes, it must also pay 22 miscellaneous taxes at various checkpoints, including the Xiahekou inspection fee, wharf registration fee, handling fee, permit fee, cancellation fee, likin, stamp fee, Xihua Customs skin tax, private fee, Nanling branch card cancellation fee, stamp fee, Wanzhi likin, Wuhu South Customs, Xiliangshan, Anhui Customs tail fee, Jiangsu Daxing Customs cancellation fee, stamp fee, Nanjing Xinhekou, Hanxing Customs, Shiyinqiao, and Shuiximen landing fee, totaling 9.49 yuan per permit. The excessive costs make it difficult to promote sales and is not conducive to revitalizing Chinese tea. He specifically requested the China National Goods Maintenance Association for assistance. It is learned that the association's executive committee has decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to abolish the contractor system and implement a "one item, one tax" system, and to order the Anhui Provincial Tax Bureau to strictly prohibit miscellaneous taxes in order to facilitate sales and alleviate the difficulties of merchants.</p>

<h3 id="e117">There Will Be Unprecedentedly Fast Liners on the Sino-European Route <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>British Merchants Specially Build the Fastest Five Mail Ships</p>
<p>Japanese Shipping Companies Discuss Countermeasures</p>
<p>Since the Japanese Post Office added two new mail ships, Jingguomaru and Zhaoguomaru, to the Sino-European route, the British company "Great Britain" has been the leader in the Far East-Europe shipping industry. They are very reliable with ship schedules and have a high value on passenger service. Every fourteen days there is a boat to London, and they are well known for exporting silk and tea from Shanghai. They are still ranked number one in exporting lake silk and Chinese tea to Europe this year, even surpassing the Blue Funnel Line. Since adding five R-class ships with a net tonnage of 16,000 tons last year, the sea route from Shanghai to the United Kingdom has been reduced from forty-two days to thirty-eight days. In recent years, commercial shipping has trended towards fast ships, and exports of silk and tea have paid great attention to market conditions. Faster shipping means more freight. In order to maintain its special position as the number one company in the Far East, the British shipping company proposed building unprecedentedly fast ships to join the Sino-European route. Furthermore, the Blue Funnel Line is also building eight new-style express ships of 10,000 tons each, powered by motor engines, on the Shanghai-London route, with five of them already completed and soon to be in service. The Italian shipping company is also replacing four express ships to operate in China. The company has decided to build five more giant ships, each with 25,000 tons, with a maximum speed of 28 knots per hour and a normal speed of 23 knots per hour, compared to the current 18 knots per hour of various companies. The sea route between China and Britain can be reduced by five days. This is already under construction. These fast ships are unprecedented in the Far East-Europe route, operating exclusively on the Shanghai-London route, with the eastbound route also going to Yokohama, Japan. When the Japanese Post Office and Osaka Company received this news, they feared that the eighteen ships of the Japanese company currently operating on the European route would be overwhelmed after the strong-speed ships were put into service. In order to save the Sino-European Japanese shipping industry, they invited all Japanese shipping companies to discuss countermeasures to resist this. Fierce competition will occur between British and Japanese shipping companies on the Sino-European route.</p>
