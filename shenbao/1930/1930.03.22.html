<p>時評</p>
<h3>產業合理化</h3>
<p>近自各國貨現工業金融衰落之象。而產業合理化之名詞。遂成爲一時髦名詞矣。其實此名詞。殊不新頴。即在日本。亦非創自今日。自大地震後。早已醖釀此種運動。如合併小銀行小公司而成大銀行大公司。又如議會中之兩稅委讓。稅制整理。自耕農制定等案。皆爲合理化政策之表現也。查此合理化之名詞。爲經濟組織之一種制度。世界經濟學者。研究此制度之由來。謂發軔於美國。其名詞初釋爲自動的企業聯合。繼又釋爲科學的管理。均認爲包括未盡。其後研究者愈多。乃得一種定義。謂欲達到以最低之物價。購得質並佳之貨品之目的。必須以科學原則。應用於人工。管理。與工業經濟界是也。換言之。即欲以合理的方法。改良生產組織。計劃生產機關的集中。使商品多量製造。並且節約生產費。提高販賣價格。合理化之意義。不外乎是。惟此制度試騐之後。美國旣無顯著成效。德國於戰後急欲謀救濟產業混亂恐慌。故極力推廣倣行。然其結果。祇資本家自身。獲得一時之潤利。而勞動方面。並未得到實益。故時人評此政策爲資本家主義的獨占政策。德人在當時。雖力辨爲獨占之目的。在穏定市塲。並非榨取消費者。但其最後結果。非特市塲不能穏定。資本家自身。亦幾與勞動者同成弩末之勢。此其情形。已顯然可見者也。况乎今日之情勢。更與昔日不同。昔日之美德。工業亟待振興。生產亟待增加。用此合理化。之集中方法。或可收一時之效。若在今日。生產正嫌過剩。貨物正慮無地容納。則此所謂合理化之方法。僅能於生產與消費之間。作調劑之用。所獲之效果。必不甚鉅。日本對此產業合理化。雖未大試騐。然亦已小小施行。效果亦大略可覩。故近今一度倡議之後。從而和附之者。實鮮有所聞也。</p>

<h3>華當局駁斥自來火公司總董談話</h3>
<p>言論與事實背道而馳</p>
<p>前日（二十日）文匯報載、該報爲中國當局與上海自來火公司、發生嚴重交涉、特派代表謁見該公司總董康寗、（Ｃａｍｉｎｇ）面詢詳情、康氏發表意見、謂該公司供給閘北外僑二十户煤氣、華界當局要求分潤、公司年付銀一千兩、用爲掘路報酬費、至去年爲止、後因公用局績提要求、遂於去年四月四日、開股東會之前、停止照付、又謂、該公司對待華租兩界當局不分彼此、如因租界</p>
<p>以外之外僑及其他用户、接用煤氣、華人借此要求分潤理由殊欠正當云云、聞市公用局見此消息、且係該公司總董之負責表示、特將其謬誤之點、預備向公司質問、大致爲（一）十八年四月四日、該公司代理工程師培克函稱、公司在閘北地界内所埋煤氣總管、共長二萬八千七百七十尺、</p>
<p>供給煤氣三百户、十七年份、每月平均銷售煤氣二百三十四萬六百六十立方英尺、中國用户中、單就南務印書館一家計、十六年全年煤氣用費、二萬二千七百餘元、十七年增至二萬九千八百餘元、而康氏謂供給煤氣二十户、且係外僑、此與事實相去、何止萬里、（二）公司覓埋管修管掘動路面、公家爲之修改、自應貼費、查歷年公司於租界當局、則無不照繳、於華界則故意延宕、其在本市未成立以前、無案可　者、姑不具論、十六年份、掘路貼費、共繳一百七十五元零一分五厘、十七年一月至六月、掘路貼費六百六十元零八分、經再三催索、始於十八年一月繳納、十七年六月至十二月、所有掘破路面、已由本市修復、應缴之一千三百五十三元六角九分、屢催　　至今未繳、而公司於十八年二月間、在東寳興路、擅自掘路修管、旣不繳費、且不請照、公司在華界營業、而弁髦中　法令、寗有是理、乃康氏謂、每繳掘路報酬費一千兩、（掘路貼費、視掘破路而之大小而定、决無每年包定之理、）至去年一日止、且稱係華界當局請求公潤、此與事實、又何止相去萬里、（三）查該公司每年向公共租界工部局、繳銀一千兩、法租界工部局二百十兩、而歷來對於華界、祇享權利、不盡義務、最近談判訂約、始商定爲每年營業稅連土地使用費、約四百元、然約旣未能即訂、稅亦不知何日始繳、即此一端、康氏所謂公司對待華租兩界、不分彼此、言行豈非矛盾、（四）市政府與商辦公用事業、公司訂立合約、一方周爲執行職權上必要之手續、一方亦所以使公司營業與市民利益、各得</p>
<p>其所、兩無衝突、絶非純粹捐稅問題、公司應遵守政府法令、政府則給予相當保護、市内華商如此、外商當然不能獨在例外、公用局本此主旨、迭與該公司磋議訂約　且鑒於該公司每有玩視功令、自由行動、尤覺不容再緩、且該項合約、已於本年一月二十九日集議時、大致商妥、公司對於所提條件、俱已同意、祇因要求免繳所欠掘路貼費一千四百五十七元、爲該局拒絶、乃蓄意延宕、於是該局始有限期責令辦妥訂約手續之舉、康氏所謂、華人要求分潤、不知何指、如以訂立合約納稅四百元爲分潤、則該公司年繳公共租界一千兩·法租界二百十兩、亦復何爲、現在對於訂約、華界當局、一再展限、公司則一再延期、故延約及其他一切責任、均應由公司負担</p>

<h3>華人又被日本拒回</h3>
<p>華人赴日、近因日本施行取締新章、故上</p>
<p>海往日之華人、時有被日人驅逐之事、昨日又有大批華人、爲日人禁止上陸、排斥歸國、茲將此事原委、查記如下、</p>
<p>取締新章、日人嚴拒中國人至日、已施用種種方法、或用金錢限制、或用聯環担保、凡能排斥華人到日本者、無所不用其極、今則更頒新例、其辦法係採取祇許華人離日、不許額外多增華人入境、係由日本各港口水警署、頒發一種入境證書、祇限于已在日人執業之華人歸國時所領用、例如在東華人、欲回中國、須領此證、否則便不許再往該國、自此例實行後、無證往日之客、乃悉被拒回也、</p>
<p>預繳船價、各日輪公司明知無水警證　娌書之中國旅客、不能到日本、但爲營業計、乃令赴日華客、預線四十金在輪公司、以作拒絶入境押乘原輪還滬之船票價目、故近頃驅逐之華人、均皆先付艙位費、所受損失頗太也、</p>
<p>檢舉嚴厲據日人言、今回日本當局之嚴厲禁阻華人入境、因在本月十日、於某輪進口時、發見有六七十名華人、欲混進日本、有充商人、有僞稱學生、現均扣留、即在此一旬内、將分批送回上海、刻神户長崎名古屋横濱各水警、于華人上陸、檢查綦嚴、</p>
<p>被逐歸國、昨日日輪長崎九來滬、有華人嚴德福、蔡友劉、郭俊南、林傳祿、孔鳳春、葛應岐、楊作勛、吳英萊、林春守、嚴德順、詹經豐等十六人、因違反其新頒</p>
<p>之取締章程、故一律禁阻上陸、各人多爲吳服商、昨悉到滬矣、又據日人消息、日當局新又議定、凡中國華僑工人、均絶對禁止上陸、而于無證書者、更不能通融云、</p>
<h3>日輪笠置丸失事</h3>
<p>日輪笠置丸、今次由日運大批貨件來滬、甫經開離日本、即被撞壞、貨物已大受損失、茲將所聞種種、分誌如下、</p>
<p>神户外撞壞、日本郵船會社笠置丸、此次自日本大阪神户開出、滿裝來滬客貨、照例昨午可以進口、昨日滬社接得日本來電、言笠置丸輪、自十六日由神户出</p>
<p>發、即與進口之某日輪互撞、笠置丸之船、身外舷被撞成一大洞、海水即衝進艙内、船身頓增重量、有下陷之勢、時船主岩下籘太郎、急電神户分社、派輪到港口將笠置丸設法拖回神户卸貨、以便大修、</p>
<p>貨物大損的、笠置丸輪中所裝來滬貨件、共有一千餘噸、棉紗疋頭甚多、且均爲華商所定購之貨、原定昨日提卸者、被撞後已有一艙貨物、被海水衝進、全受水漬、毁壞者不少、刻在駁卸、該社已决定將已受損未受損各貨、改裝三笠丸代運來滬、准二十三日到上海、起卸時再檢查損失數額、而船内之旅客、亦轉三笠丸到上海云</p>
<p>通知各客家、昨日本埠日郵社、已發布通告、知照各貨主各客家、略謂笠置丸不幸撞壞、船内貨件、因此受損者、即照共同海損法辦理、望各客家在二十三日以前、先將與共同海損有關之單據、即行檢交本社、以憑辦理、損害貨物俟騐明後、再通知云、</p>

<h3>蘇民衆預選球賽之糾紛</h3>
<p>東吳球員資格問題足球錦標未决</p>
<p>今日繼續舉行球類比賽可以完畢</p>
<p>江蘇全省運動會民衆預賽、昨日繼續舉行球類比賽、日前省校田徑第一、由蘇中獲得、因隊員資格發生問題、獎品由會保存、今東吳足球籃球隊員亦因資格、而成糾紛、今日尙有球賽、大致可以完畢、茲將詳情錄下、</p>
<h3>足球决賽</h3>
<p>東吳以七比三</p>
<p>勝上海縣聯隊</p>
<p>錦標尚未到手</p>
<p>蘇省民衆於選會足球得决賽權者、爲東吳大學隊與上海縣混合隊、兩隊於二十一日上午十時比賽、由杜庭脩任裁判初賽、未及一分鐘、東吳五前鋒盤球入上海内衛區域、上海内衛以手觸球被罰十二碼、由東吳羅志枚主踢、一就而進、未幾、東吳内衛躍起踢球腿踢於上海左鋒肩華數判員亦判罰十二碼、球由上海左内衛主踢、急而有力、一射入網、嗣後球常盤旋於上海區域、連續由朱崇恩攻入三球、上半時結果四比一、東吳勝、</p>
<p>下半時、易地再戰、上海得順風之助、球勢轉佳、先後攻入兩球、惟東吳各個技術、較上海爲優、且聯絡得法、經幾度之努力、亦打進三球、結果七對三、東吳奪得錦標、</p>
<p>東吳陣線</p>
<p>呂高輝陳應春　尹攻逵戴廣運　王守芳　余貽澤趙錫田　朱崇恩　楊壽林　羅志枚　張夢白隊長東吳球隊</p>
<h3>男網球賽東吳獲錦標</h3>
<p>二比一勝亞美隊</p>
<p>東吳男網球隊於二十一晨十時、以二比一戰勝亞美隊得决賽權午後一時、與南京中學作奪標賽、以三比○獲勝、東吳隊員劉紹勳郭豫杰張似佳、</p>
<h3>男籃球複賽</h3>
<p>東吳五三比三一</p>
<p>勝上海中學</p>
<p>得决賽權成問題</p>
<p>二十一午後三時、東吳大學籃球隊與上海中學比賽、結果五三比三一、東吳勝、裁判員杜庭修、東吳得網球錦標、</p>
<h3>東吳足球錦標</h3>
<p>因隊員王守芳資格</p>
<p>發生問題尙未解决</p>
<p>已電詢全國運動會</p>
<p>民衆預賽會球類錦標前日多已解决、昨日網球爲東吳所獲、獨足球籃球尙有問題、原東吳足球籃球隊歷敗羣雄、所向無敵、其球員中有王守芳者在要校讀書免除膳宿費擔任中校體育事務、四大學體育會曾允其出席比賽、此次引起各方抗議法規委員會會對於王之資格、日前電詢全國運動會、議示辦法至昨日尙未接得回覆、如王無問題、昨日足球錦標已歸東吳籃球亦得决賽權不然、本屆足球錦標、即予取消、不再作任何比賽、而上中亦即恢復其籃球决賽權、故王周折全待全國運動會一言以解决之、</p>
<h3>不派足球隊</h3>
<p>昨晚選擇委員會决定</p>
<p>昨晚選擇委員會議决、蘇省不派足球隊出席大會、錦標俟王守芳資格解决後定奪、</p>
<p>此次蘇首運動大會、蘇州中學團體友個人總分、續獲冠軍、惟因新生陸某參加運動資格問題、各校羣起攻擊、該校校長汪典存、爲維持會塲秩序、提高運動精神起見、特向大會聲明、會章旣未規定新生在校須經若干時間方、能參加運動則陸生資格、毫無疑義、運動不可中止、獎品可以捨讓、故發獎時、楊杏佛氏當衆宣佈此意、將奬品暫予保留、蘇中學生服從命令繞塲游行歡呼、秩序甚佳、次日該校全體運動員、仍整隊到塲、參加民衆運動、續獲籃球勝利、又聞該校運動各色俱全、國技表演、亦列第一、得江蘇敎育經費管理處銀盾一座、而其運動員五十人、態度鎭靜、可見該校訓練之一斑云</p>

<h3>誌楊少侯先生</h3>
<p>— 陳微明</p>
<p>楊先生少侯。名兆熊。直𨽻永年縣人。世稱楊無敵露禪之孫。健侯之子也。得祖若父之傳授。又從其世父班侯學。其藝甚精。年十九。與班侯之徒萬春者比手。跌萬春於門扉。扉震壞。由是知名。先生性矜傲。喜飲酒。醉則更甚。故多忌之者。先生傳田紹先生志學等。余從先生之弟澄甫先生學。屢請敎于先生。先生亦樂與余言。其言均拳中精義余輙記錄之先生年益高。拳法益緊奏。出手甚短。而意則遠。勢若止。而神欲行。倐喜倐怒。若貓之捕鼠。鶻之搏兔。知與不知。觀者無不歡笑鼓掌曰。此老神足氣完。歎觀止矣。去歲致柔拳社開會。先生來滬演拳。意興甚高。與余談兩日夜。不離拳法。遂别去。嗟夫。當茲武術振興之會。正英雄得意之秋。而先生乃以自裁聞。雖其剛烈之性。至老而不變。	然以一餐之難。竟至計無所之而出於一死。安得不爲之扼腕而長歎也哉。先生之殁、年已七十云。</p>
<h3>參觀獨立沙龍記</h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>第四十一屆之獨立沙龍。於一月初至二月终在巴黎舊皇宮開會。余先後往觀二次。茲將觀後之感想。略記於後。</p>
<p>自余來歐洲後。參觀獨立沙龍畫展。已經二屆。覺該會有多而不精之感。每次出品總數。槍畫約五千點。雕刻亦較其他展覽會爲多。凡陳列作品。俱不審查。優劣並陳。本屆共陳列繪四千四百餘點雕刻及日用小工藝品四百六十二點。分陳四十五室。每室中央皆陳雕刻。陳設及光線。都甚適宜、惟每觀一室。得滿人意之作品。僅十之二三。其餘皆平凡之物也。</p>
<p>巴黎年中不大小畫展除夏季較少外。殆無日無之。其範圍最大者凡五。即春季展。秋季展。冬季展。獨立展。及院展。（Ｓａｌｏｎ　Ｔｎｉｌｅｒｉｅ）五展中名家出品最多而最齊整者。首推院展、其次秋季展。餘皆限制極寛。尤以獨立畫展。其目的在公開。當四十年前組織此會之宗旨。爲對抗學院風之繪畫而設。因當時學院風畫派。固守傳統。太偏形式。該會欲使一般青年未名作家。可任意發展天才。又不致使其他畫展一時落選而令作者灰心。立意至善。吾人對於今日之獨立畫展。當須另眼看待。法國新藝術之勃興而占全世界藝術之中心點者。該會與有力焉。現代巴黎新派巨頭。皆由此會提携而起。現任會長薛揑克。Ｓｉｇｎａｏ是點描印象繪畫的創始者。其繪畵手法。以色點排列而成。形如織物。最先同創此畫派者。尙有賽哈。Ｓｅｌｌｒａｔ賽哈早逝。現推薛揑克爲代表人物。氏著有專書。詳述點描派之意義。一時青年追從者甚衆。惟余不喜其畫。因其見解及手法。含科學分析方法過甚。</p>
<p>現在各國藝術家集居巴黎者。計八萬人。技術之優劣、雖素人亦能辨别。有特異才能或自闢新路者。决不令其埋没、無内容而虚張聲勢者。决無出頭之理。至於出品。極爲自由。凡自願出品任何展覽會。每人須出陳列費七十法郎。作品以二幀爲限。獨立展每次出品人數。常在三千名以上。其獲利爲最大也。</p>
<p>各國人在巴黎研究美術者。皆有出品於各展覽會。我國人亦常有之。但技術之弱。不可諱言。余每次參觀畫展。覺歐人對於時代藝術之猛進。宛似奇花怒放。同時深感藝人應努力自身。勿爲虚名所蟲感也。</p>
<h3>提倡國貨之光華燐寸</h3>
<p>— 譚秋郎</p>
<p>溯自燧人氏敎民取火之術。始創烹飪熟食之制。惟彼時之取火。或接於日光。或鑽於木類金屬。覓取火料。頗非易事。自科學進化發明燐寸（即火柴）後。民衆實利賴之。友人毛君。供職於杭市光華火柴公司。一昨來申。談及此中槪况。頗有足述者。因誌之如次。</p>
<p>杭州光華火柴公司。規模宏偉。出品繁夥。頗足稱雄於江南數省間。客歲工商部長孔祥熙氏蒞杭。由市長周象賢氏導往參觀該公司各部。其對於内部組織。甚加贊美云云。按該公司輸出之貨。平均每日總有百五十箱。而每箱中裝入憐寸七千二百小匣。總計達一百零八萬小匣。其營業之廣。固非他家所能望其項背也。</p>
<p>君謂此盈寸之一匣火柴。物雖至微。然非經過五十轉手續。不克成此。迺知物力維艱。於斯益信。又謂該公司中之出品。大别爲紅頭、黑頭、黄頭三種。其黑頭者。（即普通者）除供給浙之全省外。餘如蘇皖閩贛等省。均有銷出。至紅頭者。則爲浙之常山玉山等處人民所樂用。他如黄頭紅桿之一種。僅爲蘇之溧陽一邑所獨銷。而此種選料。亦爲最上品。唯原料除匣壳外。其他藥料及木桿料。均須取给於舶來品。余詢以何弗採用國貨。免致利權外溢、彼謂若用國貨製木桿。無此堅衂之材。蓋火未擦出。而桿已先折矣。至藥料則國内無此巨額之貨。且復價昂。故祇得購辦彼貨也。再藥料之配製。黑頭火柴。約爲白藥、廣丹、鉛粉、燐、硝、銻粉、　楊等七種。調製而成。而紅頭者。則僅白藥、硝、硫化燐等三種配合足矣。年來某國因鑒於火柴營業之有利可圖。故巧製各種牌號。頻年運銷吾華。金錢溢出。不可勝計。思之殊深憤慨。差幸浙之當軸。提倡國貨。不遺餘力。一方慰勉該公司出品務求精速。一方則重捐輸入之外貨。苟能再從事研究國產原料。俾成完全國貨。則未始非杜漏　之一端矣。</p>
<h3>慧山公園之游</h3>
<p>— 荊夢蝶</p>
<p>慧山之有公園。始於往歲秋間。余以</p>
<p>俗塵栗六。迄未一過。山靈有知。當笑人已。昨吾宗少磐先生來錫。相邀陪往。達山麓停車。以是園僻在一隅。如覓桃源。迷不得路。幾經問津。乃至基地。園爲李公祠改建。觀屋宇之莊嚴華貴。想見當年合肥勳業之盛。茲雖化私爲公、而撫今思昔。感慨係之矣。地不甚廣。以精雅勝。名曰公園。實如山莊也。入門。歷廳事後。漸入佳境。其側一春池。長廊曲檻環之。有亭翼然。此寒厓聯語。所謂勝如天上坐。宛在水中行者也。余等入座。相與啜茗小憩。已而傍午。即命傳者進食。水碧山青。無非下酒物也。時則游人罕至。山鳥不譁。坐對故人。相逢異地有鄉親之雅。無主客之分。席間縱談湖海。慨念家山。塊壘盡消。煩憂頓釋已。飯罷拾級登山。迤行至忍草菴。該貫華閣閣爲清初納蘭容若與顧梁汾去梯玩月於此。遂成古蹟。日久就荒。近歲邑人士集資重修。三層傑閣。煥然一新。聞尙有容若之圖像詩扇存其中。惜余未之見。然讀飲水詞而嚮往其人也久已。頭閣與慧山公園相望。李公以清社之屋而祠遂廢。容若且系出滿族。以貴公子作詞人。乃其餘韵流風。至今錫人猶爲之興滅繼絶焉。豈薄彼而厚此耶。良以文章之重於富貴。獨能歷滄桑之變。而自有千古。是知名山事業之不可爲而可爲。古之人實愚而不愚也。爰並誌之。</p>
<h3>胡樸安之詩</h3>
<p>— 志政</p>
<p>新經國府任命爲江蘇民政廳長之胡樸安氏。原任正風文學院敎務長及兩路編緝課長等職。對於整理國學。頗具勞績。廳長未發表前。嘗作移居詩云。（海上驅飢二十年。蝸廬今日已三遷。載車惟有書盈帙。容膝何妨屋似船。棲鳥驚寒巢未穏、勞薪析足火能傳。華堂陋室知何似。都是南柯一枕眠。）語意間。多示不得意。孰知一詩甫成。簡命隨頒。今且赴省就職矣。回視此詩。能無失笑。亦佳話也。因偶記之。</p>

<h3>北平劇訊</h3>
<p>— 看雲樓</p>
<p>三月一夕。開明劇院楊小樓演鐵籠山。新艶秋鴛鴦塜。春雨連綿。竟上滿坐。次夕小樓艶秋菊朋合演摘纓會。新又與楊合唱法門寺。雙齣重頭。上座益盛。是夕中和戲院雪艶琴本貼全部玉堂。戲報山出。臨時回戲。此種現象。平中常有之。意在避鋒。不足咎也。</p>
<p>七日艶秋隨母若兄赴津。祝李直繩準六十壽。並演探母駡殿兩齣。定九日回平。因十夕開明戲碼已定駡殿。菊朋爲配。小樓定落馬湖云。</p>
<p>霸王遇噳姬一劇。已抄分本。不日在開明出演。别姬一劇。已與小樓唱過。口碑載道。不讓乃師。（謂梅畹華）虞姬獨創新局。更當轟動九城矣。</p>
<p>小樓於艶秋藝事。極其贊賞。又以開明營業。日益發達。艶秋之功爲多。尤有聯絡之必要。小樓故擅小生戲。於艶秋之貂蟬。願配呂布。以表好感。日前某坤伶出演天津春和院。託該院李華亭約上樓合唱别姬。藉增聲價。小樓婉拒。華亭固請。小樓道（我的别姬虞姬一角。男有蘭芳。女有艶秋。豈肯輕易與他人配演。以後如有機會。當同新艶秋老板到貴院去唱一回。旁人怕夠不上這個資格罷）言時夾脆沈着。如飾黄天霸一般。華亭遂掃興而别。一時傳爲笑柄。</p>

<h3>紗花紗市現象安謐</h3>
<p>本月期多頭多頭已逐盤吐出</p>
<p>海外棉市甚堅本埠以時局不良、底貨尙厚、故賣方壓迫甚力、散户多數抛空、因此市况頗呈萎靡不振之狀、幸實銷尙堪維空青島天津等帮採辦殷勤、紗市目前無大變化不過本月份多頭、每盤售出三百包、如無意收貨、此價尙能立定耳、</p>

<h3>棉市漸入光明之境</h3>
<p>棉市甚堅且漲風頗銳、良以美棉情勢堅挺故散户起而扒空、市勢由此趨緊但漢帮以價漲乘機賣出、市上現棉銷路依然岑寂、各廠仍無大量發動、棉市前途、全視外棉爲進退也、</p>

<h3>糧食米市逐步上漲</h3>
<p>閘北昨日各路來船十餘號本街胃口注重高貨、頂粳步漲一角開出二十元零一角、惟斯米貨品極佳市上寥寥無幾而中交北粳均升半尺之譜形勢有漲無落、薄稻走銷平正、羊秈杜秈埠秈河有寥若晨星、即如内地亦極枯薄、故申銷雖暢實際無貨可交、大盤祇緊俏而已、變陰元各檔問津稍多行情飛漲兩三角、趨勢異常活潑、</p>
<p>滬南河下來船稍接、去路不暢常錫蘇同各機粳高提次定、買氣極佳、但吃價無前日之俏南帮薄稻早稻寗帮仍有採購市價步挺羊杜尖因洋米微小趨穏、按昨市洋米期現均軟、惟洋行帮則頗有收回、故事實上市上所開、统係收貨方面之回籠貨是以價格欠佳也、而本秈雖受影響、然價不易修削耳、白元到稀銷旺、兼閘市告緊、人心看高、大盤見升兩角左右、</p>
<h3>洋米現俏期平</h3>
<p>昨日洋米繼續上漲惟内地帮辦興略淡、各米祇漲數分、但呼地紛紛閙荒、市上人心依然看好、昨統市開出二號西貢五百包、價十四元六角半、小絞米二千包、價十四元四角七分、大絞二千包、價十三元七八角茄佛四百包、價十三元八角、蘇　地米七百包、價十五元二角、期米共開八千餘噸、市轉定局、因有一部份洋行售出、人心已不似日前之嚴重、</p>
<h3>粉市被小麥带高</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上下午開盤後、各月份忽見震動、查此中主因近期如三四五月份、則以廠家現貨不多、實銷則陸續尙有去路、洋麥報價較漲三四角不等、而牽带較爲重要者、則在標準小麥、交割已近、合格者甚屢不多、故頗有軋空之傾向、小麥市氣一佳粉價勢須带起、故全日成交雖不暢市面則逐開逐昻、遠期新粉以外行心思亦佳内地客户、吸進頗湧、亦見带俏、結果本月份較前日好一分二厘半、四五月份各好二分六月份好一分、七月份好五厘、八月份二厘半云</p>
<h3>麥市軋空之象愈顯</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上下午開盤後、各月份均一致轉漲、而本月份以交割已近空頭抵補甚勁、微聞本月份之多頭、大致均須收貨空頭則次品居多、未能照解、因此互相擠軋、頗有軋空之象、當最高時曾至五兩二錢六分、後則回小二分、四六月份亦以此故、带俏甚勁、遠期尙見平穏、觀後步如多頭不出、本月份尙須軋高一點也、結果本月份較前日漲四分、四六月份各漲三分、七八月份各好一分、現麥微呈好面、惟見交者均係中次、好貨不多、開蚌埠麥五兩零五分、江西麥五兩零二分、四兩九錢、四兩六錢、湖南麥四兩七錢二分、四兩六錢六分、共開二千包、由阜豐申大辦去云</p>
<h3>黄豆步堅</h3>
<p>昨日荳市見緊、北路來貨稍有、全仍係解抛居多、長江來源極微、祇申存尙可、而本街小磨帮與車坊續有問津、内地帮亦覺爽化、現貨連元高開五兩四錢六七分、標準近期開五兩四錢至三錢九分、步好二三分、遠期亦因有本埠號客團積而秀、至於漢乍九冬等豆、全日交易不多、大盤與前日相彷</p>
<h3>疋頭花布下跌不已</h3>
<p>本廠棉布邇來市情、日形見軟、實以時局謠諑孔多、客銷觀望、以致毫無興奮氣象、粗斜·</p>

<p>東西疋頭各大帮大都停頓、市面一致無神、蓋以戰雲瀰佈、深恐嗣後貨價下落、暫呈擯持狀况、惟本街因天時轉暖、春令貨紛紛上市、走銷尙不寂、東貨之印花蔴紗昨成交一百餘件、壽老騎鹿開二錢二分半、鵝童魚二錢一分半、新到之印花洋紗、尙未售開、花布跌風益烈、昨已四兩進關矣、西貨織花洋紗昨厦門·福州等帮略來添辦、德記大發財爲三錢七分半、紅記浣花溪三錢七分、本街以蓆法繆布較爲活動云、</p>
<h3>絲花中日絲價背道而馳</h3>
<p>横濱日絲自日金解禁以來、金價狂漲、三館帮對於日絲因扯價較昂、類均停頓不動、絲價銳跌此次雖奉日政府撥欵保障絲價、日絲市面頓趨激漲、無如邇來金價依然上升日絲歐銷仍趨疲滞、前美各莊以扯價合算分起團積、加以昨晨紐約滬廠經電轉不弱、貨缺價益俏利、昨由乾利等進滬白廠經八十包、公安進白乾經十包價均堅漲云、</p>

<p>悲鴻夫子鈞鑒、敬肅者、生等前由巴黎奉上一片、諒已收到、上欲乘耶誕節之暇、作渴想已久之巴黎游、計留彼九日、得徧觀各美術館之大槪、其餘建築名勝、以爲時迫促、未遑徧訪、魯佛爾内容浩瀚、生等窮三日之力、僅得如直馬看花、置身其間、恍如捲入巨濤汪洋之中、而不自持也、首次見盎根爾之原畫（泉）、色彩及線條之華麗、誠足解素日崇慕之渴、次歷意大利派畫家之室、初次乍見、即予余等以深鐫之印象、拉飛爾不愧爲畫聖、而斯百尤愛底西盎（ＬｅＴｉｔｉｌｎ）之（下葬）、其色彩表情結構、均足新人眼目、他室尙有其半身像一幀、亦屬傑構、至舉世聞名之Ｖｉｎｃｌ、其微笑及耶蘇童時Ｓｔ－Ａｎｎｅ等幅、背景幽暗、與人體之色性質判然、生等欣賞徘徊、久而不得其妙處所在、此或吾等鑑别不精之故、循此室而行、有荷蘭及西班牙諸大師作品、其間自以倫自蘭與維拉司關爲最、前者寫人間之神秘、後者表現其卓絶之力能自各有其不朽之點、雷朋滿室富麗、眩人眼目、惟是否均係該氏親筆所作、何數量若此其多也、其他畫室最足令人驚心動魄者、當推特拉克羅幻謝理果等、其情感之熱烈、允足另人心折、前者色彩頗富東方意味、逆料其必曾游土耳其等處、然否普呂動能别樹一幟、蓋能取生命於古代雕刻人體中、其用色亦不可冀及、步纎用色、美則美矣、惜嫌透明而不堅固、葛是與樊多均嫌小家風味、若逹維則用筆用色、俱可宗法矣、憑回憶所及、尙有孤而蓓（風景）、李干（肖像）、夏斯略方當賴都爾等亦不失爲大家、噫嘻、誠天下之觀也、溯畫史以千八世及十九世紀初、爲人才鼎盛之時、覩此而後倍信、迨入近代之畫室境界爲之一變、吾人始覺與自然相接觸、米萊盧梭特軋史西史雷等别具無窮風味、其間米萊之淳厚穆耐之自然尤嘆觀止、其他心愛尙多、非一時所能盡述、將來如益以時日、得窮其源流、明其蛻化、則趣味當更濃矣、</p>
<p>此次參觀魯佛爾之後、得一印象、覺在該處臨畫者、吾國人佔有一小部份、劉海粟正臨米萊之拾穗、將熱色改爲寒色、汪亞塵夫婦自朝至暮、孜孜不倦、其他亦未見佳、問劉海粟輩擬带臨畫回國鼓吹、生等深恐彼自欺欺人、失原作之本來面目、誠不可不加注意者也、</p>
<p>魯佛爾之外、游覽呂克桒堡、一如正餐之外、再吃小點、往往别具風味、惟昔日名作、或遷入魯佛爾、或移往他處、所餘自以倍難爾（向火之婦）、及達仰之（林中意樂）爲最、雕刻一部、亦頗足觀、中有去歲逝世之雕刻家步迨勒之作品、他如Ｐｏｍｐｏｓ作禽獸、能得其神、亦有奇趣、</p>
<p>小宮美術館、多已黎近代畫家、如羅郎等其餘知畫而不復憶其名矣、雕刻亦可觀、可代中古近代三裸體象徵大理石雕刻在此、</p>
<p>除此三美術館外、於生等有相當裨益者、當推駱蕩博物院及埃耐博物院兩處、因能看窺其平日用功方法、乃其取材也、Ｈｅｗｎｅｒ作畫、祇用三種、顏色可排而脫成普魯士　　　　　　　　　　　已、其每作一大幅、事前還作小稿若干、故生等近覺Ｃｏｎｐｏｓｔｉｏｎ亦屬要着、構圖不佳、即不足盡量揮發吾人思想、生等已嘗試一二次、雖無成就、要當勉力爲之、</p>
<p>此次在巴黎得與中國習畫者十餘人稔、其間不乏同志、察其言論、要不直劉氏在巴黎所爲、其植當營私、一如昔日、暑中至法國邊境、僞稱至瑞士、實則暗中收買他人文章、登滬報以取利、恣意攻訐、毫無信實、生等於此等無聊消息、亦第姑誌之云、巴黎中國學生、研究美術者日多、惟大半以境遇不佳、或無力入學校研習、未有特出者、且巴黎美術專門學校純係自動、敎員來校時間甚少、敎室内學生复多、生等於此散點、覺與里雍。各有利弊、未知吾師以爲何如、宋君中玩、每日至魯佛爾畫石膏、甚用功、已投攷美專石膏班、現彼於素描、甚有興趣、司徒喬先生、普晤談一次、據云、因爲經濟所困、不甚得意、已定本月底赴美國作工云云、生等在里雍工作如恒、若不見若何進步、茲奉上習作照片三張、乞正、下午習作構圖、法文以無時間已荒疏數月、奈何、又華林先生定署期左右歸國、主意宣傳文藝工作、當爲宣揚藝術助力不少也、吾師近况何似、明片已收到、謝謝專此、敬請藝安、　　　　　生王臨乙呂斯百同上、　　兩君進步甚多、怱怱遊巴黎、掛漏頗、</p>

<p>敎育部表示反對、理由是復旦法律系無十萬元的開辦費和八萬元的經常費、老實說一句、復旦自然没有這許多經費、就是國内大學中有這些經費設立法律系的、的確是寥如晨星、因爲設立法律系的學校希少、以後研究法律的人才必較從前少、方今訓政伊始、百業待興、對於研究法律的人才甚是需要豈可容其不增加而反减少、而且復旦法律系所設的課程係參照東吳法科和中央法律系的、必修課</p>
<p>程幾佔全部課程三分之二、與司法院所頒布的條例更爲嚴格、中央法律系規定四年畢業、而復旦規定投考法律系一年級的、須具有普通大學一年級的程度、實際上是等於五年畢業、目的是重視法律系爲特殊性質的學系、及企圖提高我國法律學生的程度、用心不可謂不苦、現在復旦當局和學生積極地預備向敎育部交涉、以期達到美滿的目的、深望部中亦能與以相當的諒解、</p>

<p>婦女生活</p>
<h3>處女的心葵</h3>
<p>（一切女人都是古怪的、尤其是姑娘們、）</p>
<p>雷米果爾蒙Ｒｅｍｙ　ｄｅ　Ｇｏｕｒｍｏｎｔ在他的中篇小說（處女的心）裏面、寫着這兩句話、</p>
<p>果爾蒙是二十世紀的法蘭西一大文豪、（一八五八｜一九一五）一位擅寫（詩的散文）作家、他的名作已譯成中文者、有鄭伯奇的（魯森堡之一夜、）曾虚白的（色的熱情、）與姚蓬子譯的這一顆（處女的心、）</p>
<p>果爾蒙是一位很可受的作家、他的作品、多半是輕飄巧妙的、他在（色的熱情）叙文中發表他的創作意見道、（小說實在是一首詩、一定要把詩的音韻放進在散文裏、寫牠的時候、作者必需有一種愉快的幻感、無論牠是怎樣的飄忽、一個快活的下午就夠了｀｀｀｀祇是一個晚上的幾個時間中、這些字句的流泉泛溢到一張散佚的白紙上、）</p>
<p>我們現在揭開這位詩人用他豐溢情調寫成的小說、去觀察他對於（處女的心）的心理描寫罷</p>
<p>她是二十歲了、平常是一個快樂而温柔的姑娘、但能裝做冷淡、能不理眯你而且蔑視你、带着最殘酷的神氣、她的父母愛她而又怕她、所以養成了她任性行事的脾氣</p>
<p>她的名字呌做露絲、</p>
<p>有一個年將近四十歲的博物館職員呌做罕萬德的、和露絲的父親爲好友、每二年或三年、他照例要露絲家裏住幾時、　　罕萬德對於露絲的稱呼有三種、在談話時用（你、）在客人面前用（小姐、）在他心裏用（露絲、）</p>
<p>兩個人常在樹林裏年蟲、自然而　會有親近的機會、</p>
<p>他將面孔貼近她的臉、直到她的大草帽的邊沿、女人們應付這種事情多麽巧妙啊、帽子不見了、彷佛憤怒地抛棄了的一般、同時、一個非常蒼白而且蓮鬆的臉額、倒在罕萬德的肩上了、</p>
<p>她覺得她自已充滿了一種歡樂的温情、（我不再屬於我自已的了、這眞刺戟</p>
<p>人、什麽事就要發生呢、他定會在我眼睛上親吻的、我將不加抵抗、）</p>
<p>一個吻輕輕落在她的温軟的眼簾上　　（我所希望他做的事、他件件都做了、他了解我的思想嗎、還是我了解他的呢）</p>
<p>女人是複雜的、當然、不見得比男子史複雜些、不過是别有一種、爲男子們所不理解的　、她們不了解她們自已、而且她們也不想去了解、她們信託感覺、這就足夠安全地支配她們的一生、且用以解决各種爲男子們所莫可如何的問題、别人對付她們、最好應該像她們對付自已祇有從感情一道、别人纔能同她們接觸、了解只有一個方法、便是去愛她們、</p>
<p>雖則罕萬德自以爲（她並不曾愛我、我亦没有愛她吻她的眼睛、吻她的額、那是另一回事、是父親般的慈愛、）在表面上他仍當她是個女孩了看待、但是他愛了男性的本能的衝動、已默默地在挑逗着她、罕萬德自以爲太精於女性的心理了、不曾料到年青的姑娘亦會先發制人、他仿彿是個不經心的獵人、忘記了自已已經放過槍、醒來纔看見一隻鷓鴣已在他的獵袋要了、</p>
<p>至於露絲呢、她是十分快樂地遠到了她願望的頂點、她爲人所愛、這就是幸</p>
<p>福、她絲毫没有想到問問她自已是否已伴侶蘇讀餘攝</p>
<p>經入於戀愛、對於她自已的心的狀態、她毫不問及、</p>
<p>女人是完全信任現在的、男人們則多注目於將來、也許這是一種標記、表示男子的天性没有女人們的那樣組織得完善、</p>
<p>他想、她確是可愛的、在她一方面、也以爲他是一個可慕的男子、她這樣地想道、</p>
<p>（我是屬於他的了、我已將嘴唇給了他、我是他的了）、</p>
<p>在他們倆接過熱情之吻以後、她舒暢的微笑了、她是幸福、只是一個接吻、她就很滿足地自語道、（啊、現在我已結婚了、）</p>
<p>露絲是一個少女、對於此中的眞諦、</p>
<p>僅有些糢糊的預感、還不知道如何去促進她們的幸福、</p>
<p>忽然來了一個青年建築師呌做萊諾的、他健於談鋒、尤其喜歡講關於戀愛的議論、露絲覺得他的話都很有滋味、</p>
<p>（露絲看着這年青的男子的樣子使她覺得有趣、多麽奇妙的戀愛論呀、從他那個嘴裏流露出來、原來戀愛是一種運動、（因爲萊諾曾經說過戀愛是再好没有</p>
<p>的運動、没有一種游戲能比它更適於保持女人手足的柔軟的、和網球、坐自行車、或騎馬一樣的、怎樣的一個啓示呀、當她的目光跟隨着這個智慧果敢的青年的遠影時、最奇離的幻想誕生在她心裏了）她驚疑自語道、</p>
<p>（不知道人們對於變愛、對於眞的戀愛、是怎樣亨樂的、罕萬德不曾敎我一點東西、他關於戀愛是什麽都知道的、大槪比這年青的萊諾還多吧、但他留心着不告訴我、當嘲弄著我的天眞時、他把我當作一個小姑娘看、這是一種温柔的嘲弄、因爲他是愛我的、但是他濫用了他優越的地位了、一種游戲、一種游戲｀｀｀｀｀）</p>
<p>露絲在没有遇見罕萬德以前、她常常默做着這樣稚氣的幻夢、</p>
<p>（一個美麗的年青的騎士｀｀｀｀｀他默默地將他的馬在我身旁勒住、俯下身子抱</p>
<p>起我來、放在馬鞍上、於是我們出發了、在途中我們作了一程瘋狂的、憤怒的、無盡頭的馳騁、後來我便睡着了、事實上、我實在常似從睡眠中醒過來一樣、但是我没有睡着、祇在青虚的空氣裏無聲地驅馳了一番、然而當我恢復意識的時候、我却覺得疲倦｀｀｀｀｀我曾幾度做過這樣的夢呀、）</p>
<p>自從他遇見了罕萬德後、就不再做這樣的夢了、</p>
<p>他們终於訂了婚約、露絲雖然嘴裏不說、心裏却望早早結婚、可以知道這小說的結局、可是女人是生性慣於長期間的忍耐的、同時他們也格親密起來、但每次罕萬德除了親吻擁抱以外、要作更進一層要求的時候、露絲必定畏縮起來、抑制了驚啼、對他未婚的丈夫道、</p>
<p>（這是不應當的、尊敬我、我愛你、當我做了你的妻之後、你就可以了、但未結婚之前是不能的、我是高興和你玩的、而你却想濫用你的特權、這是不應當的、）</p>
<p>後來罕萬德發見了自已的生理健康</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>、不能和少女結婚的現像、他竟寫信給露絲、延遲了他們的愈婚、</p>
<p>小說轉了一個局面、這時就發生一件意外事出來、</p>
<p>那個青年建築師萊諾、現在變成爲露絲昔日幻夢中的騎士了</p>
<p>萊諾初次遇露絲、看見她對於罕萬德的熱情、使他引起一種愛情的艶羨、他起初是被少女的心的宏大所感動、因爲她愛她的戀人如此可敬的熱烈、接着他感到一般男人互相嫉視的那種浮泛的嫉妬、他憎惡罕萬德、但他不能不羨慕他的幸福、取而代之的欲望、自然發生起來了、他與露絲住在一家裏、本來是蜃樓般的變愛、現在生了根、滋長起來了、</p>
<p>他處心積慮、居然發現了罕萬德與另一個婦人的愛昧事件、他搜到了證據給露絲洩漏了秘密、萊諾而且在露絲前承認他也曾同那女人取樂過、他對露絲說道、</p>
<p>（我是缺德的、或者、但這是因爲我想着你｀｀｀｀｀我想、你剛給了他你的手的那男人、居然戀愛着别個女人、而且公開地承認、這個事我以爲是醜的、我實在爲你苦痛、你的温柔面且敏銳的感情我早看出了、是的、這使我痛心、）</p>
<p>不消說得、露絲對於罕萬德這種行爲是不肯寛恕的、</p>
<p>不久、露絲發見萊諾是在變愛她、她每次想到這危險的問題、就要回憶起她以前和罕萬的淘氣、與亨受過的娱樂、頓時一陣紅潮昇上她的臉上、因爲她回想起那使她的心比她的肉體更感快樂的接吻和擁抱而感到羞恥、她常常對自已說、（我是受辱了、我還是一個處女嗎、）</p>
<p>雖然悲哀已逐漸淡去、但露絲仍痛苦着、一晚、當她脫衣就寢時、她所許罕萬德的種種暱膩又回到她心頭來了、她的感覺雖起反感亦不能壓止、而成爲可羞的肉體的顫動、她睡在床上、在温暖的被裏、那想像的接觸的更加頻繁而且眞切起來、她的神經失去了控制的能力、在快樂的幻想衷睡着了、</p>
<p>有幾晚、情形是特别緊迫的、一走進房裏、她彷彿接受了嚴厲的命令、近着她對鏡子照看自已、她立在鏡前、熱烈地擁着自已的肩膊、有幾晚當她用態度鼓勵萊諾對她說些更温柔的話時、她覺得心境更能安靜些、氣力更充足些、正如一個信賴的病婦、愛她的醫生一樣、</p>
<p>最後、她完全忘記了罕萬德曾經蹂踏過她可憐的心她以前曾倒在罕萬德</p>
<p>鷄	蘇讀餘攝</p>
<p>的懷裏、現在同樣地倒在萊諾的懷裏了、</p>
<p>露絲在與萊諾結婚時、她找到了她的天性所需要的温情、她很快樂、小說也就完了、</p>

<p>敎育影片圖書館近况</p>
<p>紐約市内的亞美利堅博物院、在過去十幾年中、源源不斷地借出許多關於敎育的影片、給各學校開映、現在爲着初等學校和中等學校的特别需求、那博物院正在從事於敎育影片圖書館的建築、誠然、對於學生們有很大帮忙的敎育影片、是很需要着、因爲自然科學這樣東西、非經</p>
<p>親眼見着、親手試騐着、决不能得到完全領略的機會、可是、這種需求却難得着滿足、爲的是多數學校建築不起一座敎育影片圖書館的緣故、並且、這也是個困難、先生們時常感覺到、不知道他們所需要的、到底是那一種影片、不曉得這些影片可以在那兒得着、去適應每日課本的需求、</p>
<p>在過去的幾年中、爲着得了美國礦務公司、國立加拿大影片公司、和其他公司的影片的帮助、亞美利堅博物院却很盡力熱心地借出了許多敎育影片、給學校和敎育機關應用、影片一共爲若干類丨旅行類、礦務類、工業類、農業類、實業類等、這些分類的影片、都與平常課本有密切的關係、與地理·化學·工藝·生物學·經濟地理學·及其他自然科學、有特别的關係、詳細統算起來、差不多美國二十州内的學校、都是仰給於亞美利堅博物院的敎育影片的啊、</p>
<p>這博物院現已印就詳細的影片分類目錄、這麽一來、敎員們却很不費心地尋求那所需要的片子、再有、這博物院所借出的影片、是用不着租費的、只要學校能夠擔負運費、影片的租借没有甚麽問題的呀、</p>

<h3>Industrial Rationalization</h3>
<p>Recently, countries have shown signs of industrial and financial decline. Consequently, the term "industrial rationalization" has become a fashionable term. In fact, this term is not new. Even in Japan, it was not created today. It has been brewing this kind of movement since the Great Earthquake. For example, merging small banks and small companies into large banks and large companies, as well as the two-tax transfer in the parliament, tax system reorganization, and the self-cultivating farmers' legislation, are all manifestations of the rationalization policy. This term of rationalization is a kind of system of economic organization. World economists have studied the origin of this system and said that it originated in the United States. The term was initially interpreted as an automatic enterprise association, and then as scientific management, both of which were considered incomplete. Later, as more researchers studied it, a definition was obtained: to achieve the goal of purchasing goods of good quality at the lowest price, scientific principles must be applied to labor, management, and the industrial and economic sectors. In other words, it is to improve the production organization with rational methods, plan the concentration of production institutions, enable mass manufacturing of goods, save production costs, and increase sales prices. The meaning of rationalization is nothing more than that. However, after this system was tested, the United States did not achieve significant results. After the war, Germany urgently wanted to seek relief from industrial chaos and panic, so it vigorously promoted imitation. However, as a result, only the capitalists themselves obtained temporary profits, and the labor side did not receive any practical benefits. Therefore, contemporaries criticized this policy as a capitalist monopoly policy. Although the Germans at the time tried to argue that the purpose of monopoly was to stabilize the market and not to exploit consumers, the final result was that not only could the market not be stabilized, but the capitalists themselves were almost in the same position as the laborers. This situation is already clearly visible. Moreover, today's situation is even more different from the past. In the past, the United States and Germany urgently needed to revitalize industry and increase production. Using this concentrated method of rationalization may have achieved temporary results. If it is today, when production is excessively surplus and goods are worried about having no place to accommodate them, then this so-called rationalization method can only be used to adjust between production and consumption. The effect obtained will certainly not be very great. Although Japan has not greatly tested this industrial rationalization, it has also implemented it in a small way. The effect is also roughly visible. Therefore, after this was advocated again recently, there were very few who followed suit.</p>

<h3>Perilous Situation at the Naval Conference</h3>
<p>Anglo-French negotiations are at a standstill with no signs of a solution.</p>
<p>Equality between Italian and French navies is not easily attainable at the moment.</p>
<p>Japanese Naval Ministry declares the emergence of a responsibility issue.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th: The Japanese Plenipotentiary has not made any statements in the past few days due to the delayed arrival of instructions from his government. He is only slowly considering the second phase of measures, but the future is full of pessimism, which cannot be denied. The Anglo-French negotiations continue to be at a standstill, with no signs of a solution. A month has passed since the start of the conference, and only an Anglo-American agreement has been reached, with no other progress. All parties view the success or failure of the conference as a major question. The most crucial factor at this time is the Japanese government. How will its attitude and determination break through the current impasse or lead the conference to despair? Great importance is currently attached to Japan's response.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 20th: Foreign Minister Briand returned to Paris this morning. The French generally expect the Naval Conference to break down soon. Parisian newspapers all stated that the British proposal of 600,000 tons, only 100,000 tons more than Italy, is unacceptable because France needs at least 200,000 tons more auxiliary ships than Italy. It was also said that the two-hour meeting between Briand and British Prime Minister MacDonald on Wednesday night was the coldest meeting. Briand's optimistic remarks afterward were merely a cover-up.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 20th: After listening to Mussolini's detailed report at last night's Fascist Party Congress and holding a meeting throughout the night, they unanimously resolved to support the Italian representatives' position at the Naval Conference. Mussolini solemnly declared that the Italian government would not budge one step from its demand that its naval tonnage be equal to that of the strongest European continental power. Italian officials also vehemently denied rumors abroad that British and American representatives were trying to persuade Italy to compromise.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st: The Italian Plenipotentiary refused to clearly specify the number of ships and tonnage requested. Therefore, the situation of the European group conference is extremely dangerous. The British side wants to use the last resort, bypassing Plenipotentiary Grandi and negotiating directly with Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome. Grandi was very angry upon receiving this news, saying that if the British side negotiated directly with Rome, it would be an extreme insult to them. If that was the intention, he would return home immediately. Therefore, the British side had to abandon the idea of negotiating directly with Rome. However, the atmosphere of the conference deteriorated further. French Plenipotentiary Briand announced that he would return home on the 20th, also believing that there was no hope due to Italy's insistence and Britain's weakness. Therefore, he returned home to consult with Prime Minister Tardieu and temporarily observe the situation.</p>

<h3>Continued International Telecommunications</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 21st: Yesterday afternoon, Prime Minister Hamaguchi, Foreign Minister Shidehara, Navy Vice Minister Yamanashi, and Foreign Affairs Vice Minister Yoshida met at the Prime Minister's residence to discuss the response to Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki's return instructions. At the meeting, the Foreign Ministry argued that the Naval Ministry's declaration of unwavering adherence to 70% on the 17th, without notifying the diplomatic authorities when issuing this important statement, was conducted independently and could cause major obstacles to Japanese diplomacy. Therefore, it raised a rather strong protest. This statement was drafted by the Naval General Staff and published in various newspapers as a statement by the naval authorities. Some believe it was rash, and some raised the issue of responsibility. Vice Minister Yoshida told someone that at this critical moment, the Navy suddenly issued a statement, which, although an internal matter, was extremely regrettable externally. Vice Minister Yamanashi said that he wished to believe the denial that it was not a statement by the naval authorities. Various opinions were expressed on this matter, and it seemed inappropriate to make it public. If there was a need to discuss the issue of responsibility, it should be decided by Prime Minister Hamaguchi.</p>
<h3>Indian Anti-British Movement</h3>
<p>The whole country is rising in response; the government decides to adopt a non-interventionist attitude.</p>
<p>Gandhi's films banned in Bombay.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 21st: It has been a week since Gandhi's departure. No response has been seen elsewhere. Northern India and the United Provinces have not been affected. The National Party in Bengal has split into two factions. Burma is indifferent to Indian politics. The riots that occurred recently during the trial of Calcutta Mayor Sengupta in Rangoon originated from Indian civilians. Both Bihar and Assam are currently peaceful. The movement in Madras is limited to Antahala. Gandhi's assistant Fanagata Paiya may organize a resistance movement there. The situation in Bombay Province is different, as there are factory workers and railway workers stirring up trouble, which is enough to create a spirit of resistance against the authorities. The main force of Gandhi's movement is currently limited to Gujarat. The Indian government has not interfered with Gandhi, and it seems that a policy of patience and determination will eventually cause Gandhi's followers to tire and return. Many Indian members of the Legislative Assembly support the government's policy. Although they have not openly assisted the government, they all hope for Gandhi's failure, as this will give supporters of self-government a stronger voice in future round table conferences. However, Gandhi's movement has raised the question of whether the government's salt monopoly is justified. The Indian government is currently awaiting a report from the Tax Department to decide whether to comply with the Legislative Assembly's request to amend the salt law. The government is currently trying to strike down the amendment advocating the abolition of the salt monopoly in the Legislative Assembly. It is expected that the government's policy will take effect by the end of July, restoring a calm atmosphere and preparing for the round table conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ahmedabad, 21st: The All-India Congress Committee held an informal discussion meeting. Participants were willing to start a non-violent civil resistance movement against the salt tax in various provinces on April 6. Gandhi expects that he can start his movement in Kanaalpi at this time.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 20th: The Bombay government today prohibited the public performance of the film of Gandhi's departure on March 12 within the territory of Bombay. It is found that there are three such films in total, which are produced by three Indian film companies and have been approved by the Bombay Film Censorship Board for release.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Military Officers between Japan and Russia</h3>
<p>Both sides have reached an agreement.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 21st: Japan and Soviet Russia have now reached an agreement to mutually send military officers to each other's troops for experimentation. From now on, Japanese officers can enter Russian troops, and Russian officers can also enter Japanese troops, to promote the intimacy of the two countries' armies and study the internal conditions of the troops. It is found that Britain and Japan have had the same agreement for a long time, and Japan and the United States have also had this method in recent years. However, due to the different national environments of Japan and Russia, there has never been an exchange of military officers.</p>
<h3>Conservative Party Amendment Motion Rejected</h3>
<p>The Liberal Party did not vote in favor.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th: Liberal Party leader George said in the House of Commons today that the Liberal Party did not want to participate in the amendment proposal when the coal mine bill was submitted for review, because any actions by the Liberal Party that are currently unfavorable to the government would inevitably hinder the progress of the Five-Power Naval Conference. He knew that the fate of the Naval Conference was currently uncertain. This was a matter of life and death, so the Liberal Party felt that it should not be responsible for overthrowing the government or putting the government in a humiliating position. Since the Liberal Party did not vote, the House of Commons was able to reject the amendment proposed by the Conservative Party, which advocated deleting the section that the government had the right to stipulate the lowest prices for various types of coal, by 274 votes to 229. At this point, the consideration of the coal mine bill in the review committee was completed today.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>A telegram from Liu Zhennian of Yantai to all newspaper offices: I have just received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang Hao, which reads: "I hereby appoint Liu Zhennian as the Commander of the 21st Division of the National Revolutionary Army. The designation of the newly編3rd Division will be revoked immediately. In addition to the appointment letter and seal, you are to comply with this order." Upon receiving this order, I reverently and cautiously took office at the Yantai Defense Command on Jia Ri and simultaneously revoked the designation of the newly compiled 3rd Division. Zhennian is employing his meager talents to the office of Division Commander. During this difficult time, I am even more fearful of failure. I respectfully request timely advice and guidance to follow. I am deeply grateful. Liu Zhennian, Commander of the 21st Division of the National Revolutionary Army, respectfully kowtows.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Inspects Fortress at Cheng</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Communication: Commander-in-Chief Chiang, in order to assess the defense and inspect the garrison along the Jinghu, Huhangyong, and Ningzhen Cheng Song, Zhenhai five fortresses, was originally scheduled to depart today (21st). Yang Yunhua, commander of the Jiangyin Fortress, received a telegram from the General Headquarters yesterday (20th) morning, requiring him to complete preparations before the 25th and await inspection. After receiving the telegram, Commander Yang was preparing a welcome with the county government and local agencies. Unexpectedly, Commander Chiang had already departed from Beijing on the Hai Chou cruiser and sailed directly to Jiangyin. His wife, Ms. Song Meiling, and adjutant officers were with him. At 4:30 pm, the Huangshan flag platform spotted the Hai Chou warship coming, with the flag of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force flying above. The ship moved very slowly. When asked by flag language, it was known that the Commander had arrived. They urgently reported by telephone. Commander Yang immediately led officers and soldiers to the dock to greet him and fired 21 salutes to welcome him. Chiang and his wife and the captain of the ship, Li Mengbin, disembarked on a small boat and went ashore. Chiang immediately ordered Commander Yang not to disturb the local people. At that time, the alarm around the fort was extremely secret. Commander Chiang then led Commander Yang to the Xishan fort and inspected each gun position, asking Yang how many forts there were, how many cannons, the caliber, the number of soldiers, and whether the firearms were sufficient. Yang answered in detail one by one. He then praised the natural scenery of the fortress and said it was most suitable for escaping the summer heat. Ms. Song Meiling also repeatedly praised it. Commander Chiang saw that there were too few trees on the mountains, and that this natural painting was not embellished, which was a pity. He told Commander Yang that he could receive trees from the headquarters and plant them into forests. Also, the pier was dilapidated and should be evaluated and rebuilt as soon as possible. A radio station should be added to the fortress to receive news, which is very important for military affairs. You can submit a request to the Ministry of Military Affairs for installation. If there are insufficient firearms, you can get them from the ministry. He also inquired about the traffic situation in Chengxi and the local security situation in detail. After inspecting the fort at Xishan, because the time was short, he went to the headquarters for a short rest and got on the ship at 6:30 pm. He departed at 7:20 pm. It was heard that he would sail to Nantong and anchor for the night, and set sail for Shanghai tomorrow (21st) at dawn. When Chiang inspected Huangshan, the leaders of various agencies in the city heard the news and went to the headquarters to pay their respects. Because Commander-in-Chief Chiang had returned to his ship, they all returned. (21st)</p>
<h3>New Provincial Government Committee Members of Jiangsu Arrive in Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Ye Chucang, Director of Civil Affairs Hu Puan, Director of Finance Chen Qicai, and Director of Construction Sun Hongzhe, arrived in Zhenjiang this morning (21st) at 8:00 am from Nanjing in three cars, following the Jinghang and Gouzhen highways. They arrived in Zhenjiang at 11:00 am. They had previously sent a telegram to prevent various agencies from welcoming them. Therefore, only the police and the provincial government guard, and a few key officials from various agencies, welcomed them at Paiwan. Chen Hexian and He Yushu were both at the provincial residence to receive them. They had lunch at the provincial residence. After hearing the news, I drove to visit them. Mr. Ye met me in a small reception room. I asked the Chairman and the Directors and the new provincial committee when they would take office. Ye replied that he could go to the government immediately and start working. The new committee members and the new Directors would have to wait until the handover procedures of the former officials were completed before they could take over. I asked if he would take the post of committee member first. He replied that the committee member and the concurrent position would be taken at the same time. I asked how he planned to build the provincial capital and whether the construction committee needed to be reorganized. He replied that the construction of the provincial capital must continue, but he did not know the previous details very well. Generally speaking, the construction committee may be held concurrently by the directors of various departments, and the construction department should be responsible for the planning and engineering. I asked how the road construction would proceed after the labor requisition. He replied that this matter was important and had been carefully planned by the construction department, aiming to be pragmatic and take one step at a time, without daring to engage in exaggerated publicity. I asked about the education of the provincial capital, now there is only one middle school, which is not enough to meet the demand. According to the news from the China Sericulture Improvement Association, the Ministry of Education has proposed to establish a sericulture school in Zhenjiang, and the funding will be jointly raised by the national treasury, the provincial treasury, and the association. Had the Chairman heard anything about it in Beijing? He replied that he had known Mr. Ge Jingzhong, director of the improvement farm, for a long time. This matter is not only related to the education of Zhenjiang, but also closely related to the people's livelihood of Zhenjiang, so it will of course be given special attention. I asked Chen, the Director of Finance, has long been known as a financial expert. Jiangsu is the province where the capital is located. In the past, Director Zhang concurrently managed the national and provincial finances, which was quite effective. Director Chen must have contacted the central government first. He replied that of course he had contacted them, in order to benefit both the country and the province. I asked that the Department of Civil Affairs has the most complicated powers. Will the provincial government implement the county organization law in the future, or will it remain the same? He replied that the new provincial government colleagues want to do things according to law in the future, with open recruitment of personnel and open finances. As for whether it will be effective in various counties, although it is not certain, the original intention of governance has been decided in this way. This can be announced to the whole province. I asked if it was true that Luo Gaozi would concurrently serve as the Secretary-General of the provincial government. He replied that it had not been decided yet. I asked where Mr. Wang Maoru is now and whether he will come to the province to take office. He replied that Committee Member Wang had been working hard in Yunnan for a long time and had previously asked for leave to rest in Shanghai. His colleagues had asked him to come to the province to take office as soon as possible. I asked whether the Chairman would be stationed in the province full-time in the future. He replied that he had already resigned from all concurrent positions in the central government and would work in the province full-time in the future. At this point, I excused myself and left.</p>
<h3>Traffic on Hunan-Hubei Road has been restored.</h3>
<p>Changsha Communication: The Hunan-Hubei road was obstructed because the Guanbuqiao station in Xianning County, Hubei Province, was occupied by bandits and the railway tracks were destroyed. Therefore, traffic was blocked from the 15th. Now, the Hubei Provincial Government has sent Luo Lin's troops of the 22nd Division to repel the bandits on the 17th and recover the Guanbuqiao station. The railway tracks and telegraph wires were repaired overnight. Since the 18th, the passenger trains and telegrams have been fully restored. However, about thousands of Red bandits are still retreating to the area of Maqiao, which is 45 miles away from Xianning County and only more than 20 miles away from the station, and have not fled far away. In order to strive for traffic safety between Hunan and Hubei, He Jian, in addition to telegraphing He Chengjun to add troops to suppress the bandits in Puqi, Tongcheng, Tongshan, Xianning, and Chongyang in southern Hubei, also telegraphed Wang Dongyuan's brigade, which is currently stationed in Yuezhou, to send a regiment from Pingjiang to join the suppression in Chongtong, and a regiment from Yangloudong to join the suppression along the railway in Wulipai Zhaoliqiao, in order to annihilate the bandits. Now, the reports from all sides are recorded below to see the process of restoring traffic.</p>
<p>Reports from the stationmasters of the Hunan-Hubei Road (1) The Changsha East Station reported: "Xiao Hai received a telegram from the chief of the first section of the railway affairs, saying that the Guanbu Red bandits had escaped and it was possible to restore traffic quickly. A fast train from Wuchang arrived at Xiao at 10 am. The Changsha station immediately opened a large passenger train to Wuchang at 11 am. At 4 pm, another fast train was opened, and at 6:03 pm, another small passenger train was opened, all to Wuchang. The railway traffic was fully restored. The 6th fast train and the 2nd passenger train, which were stopped in Yuezhou the night before, all departed from Yuezhou to Wuchang on the morning of Xiao." (2) The Yuezhou Station reported: "The Guanbu Red bandits were Xiao defeated. More than 200 bandits fled to the vicinity of the Wulipai railway. The area is close to the border of Hunan. Please telegraph the garrison troops stationed in Yuelin to block and suppress them."</p>
<p>Report from the Detective Team of the Hunan Qingxiang Command: According to a telegram from the secret investigator stationed on the Changyue Road from Yuezhou, "The 2nd Column of the 5th Army of the Red Bandits destroyed the railway at 147 miles to Guanbuqiao on the 15th, destroying telegraph poles and the motors in the station. Huang Maofang, the stationmaster of Guanbuqiao, escaped to Xianning County, fortunately without being killed. Xiao's newly 編22nd Division Commander Luo Sen sent troops to Guanbu to suppress them. The Red Bandits occupied Dongsheng Mountain in Beitou, Xianning, and fought fiercely for several hours before the Red Bandits retreated. They are now gathered in Maqiao and Madun, etc., 45 miles outside of Xianning, trying to counterattack. Finally, Hubei sent another regiment of troops, led by a regiment commander surnamed Chen, who is now stationed in Heshengqiao, preparing to encircle and suppress them. The local people are frightened and are fleeing to Wuchang. Also, on the afternoon of Xiao, several hundred Red Bandits were found about a mile below Wulipai. Fortunately, there was a local defense force stationed there, who dispersed the bandits. The trains from Wuchang were able to pass safely."</p>
<p>Report from the Police Car Team of the Garrison Command: Guo Younan, the commander of the police car team of the Wuchang Ping Railway Garrison Command, reported: "According to Yu Yunqing, the deputy commander of the police car team of the Wuchang Chang section, who returned to Changsha from Wuchang to escort the car on the 18th, on the afternoon of the 14th of this month, he escorted the sixth fast train from Changsha to Hubei. When he arrived at Yunxi Station, according to the stationmaster, he heard that a large number of bandits were found in the area of Guanbuqiao Heshengqiao, and that attention must be paid to the cars passing through the area, etc. Upon hearing this, we immediately consulted with the security team leader and the management team leader, etc., and arranged the soldiers we led to various vehicles and took strict precautions. Also, when passing through various stations along the way, we first inquired about the situation by telegram before proceeding. Fortunately, the cars passed safely through various places and arrived in Wuchang. At 4 pm on the 15th, we still escorted the original car from Wuchang to Xiang. Just as the car was about to leave, we received a telegram from Puqi Station saying that Heshengqiao Station had been occupied by a large number of local bandits, about 2000 people, on the evening of the 14th, and that the railway tracks and telegraph poles had been destroyed, which was extremely rampant, etc. The car was immediately stopped and did not leave. Until the afternoon of the 17th, we received a telegram from Puqi Station saying that the bandits had been jointly suppressed by the 2nd Battalion of the 22nd Division and the 1st Regiment of the 9th Division, and that they had contacted each other near Hesheng Station. The bandits were unsustainable and had fled in the direction of Yangloudong. The railway tracks and telegraph wires have been repaired, etc. At 4 pm on the 17th, we still escorted the fifth fast train to Xiang, taking special precautions as before. When the car arrived at Puqi Station, we received a telegram from Zhaoliqiao Station saying that about two or three hundred bandits had been found near Wulipai Station, etc. Later, the cars passed safely through the Wulipai area. At 10 am on the 18th, the cars arrived at Changsha East Station. Because we inquired about the bandit situation along the way, we arrived four hours later than usual. Presented with respect."

<h3>Rampant Banditry Between Henan and Anhui Provinces</h3>
<p>Li Xuejie's Troops Have Been Ordered to Suppress Them</p>
<p>From our correspondent in Bengbu: In recent years, the border area between Henan and Anhui provinces has been frequently disturbed by bandits. The most severely affected areas are Shangcheng and Gushi in eastern Henan, and Liu'an and Huoshan in western Anhui. The bandit leader, Li Kebang, leads his gang, entrenched in the region, committing arson, murder, rape, and plunder with extreme ferocity. Shangcheng was captured by the bandits at the end of last month, and the entire city was emptied of its valuables. The losses suffered by the residents of the surrounding villages are countless. Gushi was surrounded by bandits a few days ago, and the county has sent several representatives to Bengbu yesterday en route to the capital to request the National Government to send troops to suppress them. Liu'an, located in remote western Anhui, has been repeatedly ravaged by communist bandits, with Mabu and Subu,</p>
<p>Dushan and other places suffering the most damage. Although troops have been dispatched to suppress them multiple times in recent years, the bandits have not been eradicated. A new band of communist bandits has recently been discovered in Qingshan, which is over fifty li away from the city, causing widespread panic among the people. The communist bandits in Huoshan previously gathered in Yanzi River, but were suppressed by troops sent by Ma Hongkui, though not completely eliminated. The newly formed 21st Division under Li Yunjie has now been ordered to go to Liu'an and Huoshan to suppress the bandits. (March 19)</p>
<h3>Zhang Huizan Departs for Ji'an</h3>
<p>From our correspondent in Nanchang: Zhang Huizan, the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief for the Suppression of Bandits in Jiangxi Province, after assuming office in Nanchang on the 18th, is sending the joint suppression troops of Cheng Guangyao, Zhu Yaohua, and Tang Yunshan's brigades to western Jiangxi early, and Deng Ying's brigade has also completed its concentration in Jishui and Xiajiang. Jin Handing's troops, recalled from Fujian, will also be able to concentrate in southern Jiangxi soon. This morning at 11:00 AM on the 19th, he led Xiao Wenduo, the Chief of the General Headquarters' Staff Office, Yang Zhongshu, the Chief of the Secretariat, and others, and departed by boat. It is reported that Zhang will convene a military conference immediately after arriving in Jishui to decide on the strategy for suppressing the bandits. Currently, Brigade Commander Tang is in Jishui, Brigade Commander Deng is in Xiajiang, and Brigade Commander Cheng is in Ji'an, all of whom can attend the meeting as scheduled. After various plans are finalized, Zhang will move into Ji'an to command everything. However, the bandit situation in southern Jiangxi has recently become very urgent. The communist bandits under Li Shaojiu and Duan Yuequan, numbering about 2,000, after capturing Xingguo, joined forces with scattered bandits from various places and a part of Zhu and Mao's forces to attack Ganzhou. At the same time, Yongfeng was also captured by the communist bandits, creating a formidable situation. Both counties have sent telegrams to the province, requesting that troops be dispatched quickly for rescue. The provincial government, in addition to telegramming Jin's division to return to southern Jiangxi quickly, also ordered the brigades in western Jiangxi to rush to Ganzhou for reinforcements. It is reported that Division Commander Jin, upon receiving the telegram, has ordered Zhang's brigade to lead Yang Ying and Xiao Xixian's two regiments to Ruijin to rush to the aid of Ganzhou.</p>

<h3>Judgment in the Case of Yu Yaoxi's Counter-Revolutionary Activities</h3>
<p>Yu Sentenced to Ten Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>From our correspondent in Jinan: The case of Yu Yaoxi, the former chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in the commercial district, for counter-revolutionary activities, once stirred up a political and party storm in the province. The former Jinan Municipal Party Committee was dissolved as a result of this case, and Xu Chaotong, the former director of the Jinan Municipal Public Security Bureau, was also dismissed. The case has now been judged by the High Court, and Yu has been sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. The judgment is recorded below: (Defendant Yu Yaoxi, 41 years old, from Haiyang County, residing in the Jinan commercial district, former chairman of the Jinan Chamber of Commerce; Li Shengsheng, 38 years old, from Weixian County, residing in the Jinan commercial district, former clerk of the Chamber of Commerce; Yang Zifeng, 37 years old, from Licheng County, former accountant of the Chamber of Commerce; the above-mentioned defendants were prosecuted by the prosecutor of this court for the crime of counter-revolution. This court, after trial, judges as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text: Yu Yaoxi, with the aim of counter-revolution, provided funds to support counter-revolutionary activities. He is sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be counted at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The parts concerning Li Shengsheng and Yang Zifeng are not accepted.</p>
<p>Facts: Yu Yaoxi served as the chairman of the Jinan Chamber of Commerce in May of the 13th year of the Republic [1924]. After Zhang Zongchang, the warlord, took control of Shandong, Yu Yaoxi spent more than 4,300 yuan of public funds to collude with him. In April of the 16th year of the Republic [1927], when the National Revolutionary Army besieged Yanzhou, the general merchants of Jinan, seeing that the Shandong Bank established by Zhang Zongchang was nearly empty, refused to accept provincial banknotes. Yu Yaoxi, in order to help Zhang Zongchang, printed and issued a notice in the name of the Chamber of Commerce to reassure the people, stating that the Chamber of Commerce would be fully responsible for the provincial banknotes to prevent merchants from suffering any losses. Zhang Zongchang used this aid to continue wreaking havoc in Shandong for another year. After Zhang Zongchang's defeat, Yu Yaoxi still sent someone to Zhang Zongchang's ancestral home in Yexian in October of the 17th year of the Republic [1928] to present a birthday banner to Zhang's father. In July of the 18th year of the Republic [1929], the Shandong Provincial Government discovered the previous situation and arrested Yu Yaoxi. Subsequently, a special investigation committee was jointly organized by the party and the government to investigate and found that Yu Yaoxi had the circumstances of collaborating with the enemy and embezzling funds. Together with the clerk Li Shengsheng and the accountant Yang Zifeng of the Chamber of Commerce, he was transferred to the court. The prosecutor investigated and filed a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Reasons: This case should be investigated and prosecuted in two parts: Yu Yaoxi and Li Shengsheng and Yang Zifeng. Regarding Yu Yaoxi: (A) Collaborating with the enemy: The prosecutor's indictment included a total of four points: (1) Yu Yaoxi, in order to ingratiate himself with Zhang Zongchang, spent more than 4,300 yuan on various expenses such as "ticket fees." (2) Yu Yaoxi, in order to assist Zhang Zongchang, printed notices to maintain the warlord's currency. Zhang Zongchang used this aid to continue wreaking havoc in Shandong for another year. (3) Yu Yaoxi still hosted banquets for Zhang Zongchang and sent a banner to Zhang's father even after Zhang Zongchang's defeat. (4) Yu Yaoxi helped Zhang Zongchang issue public bonds. It is verified that Yu Yaoxi admitted without dispute to printing notices to maintain the provincial currency, but argued that he was coerced by Zhang Zongchang. However, upon reviewing the original file of the Chamber of Commerce regarding the currency case, there was an order from Zhang Zongchang attached, which stated that all transportation agencies should uniformly accept provincial banknotes and that those who violated this would be severely punished for undermining finance. However, for the Chamber of Commerce, it only stated on one side that each Chamber of Commerce should earnestly notify all large and small merchants. There was no implication of any coercion. The fact that there was no coercion is sufficient to prove it. As for Zhang Zongchang's control of Shandong, Yu Yaoxi had already colluded with him extensively. Even after his defeat, he still sent someone to send gifts, which is sufficient to prove his willingness to collaborate with the enemy. Although Yu Yaoxi attributed the former to the fact that he had left Jinan for Qingdao and resided at the Donglai Bank in Qingdao, and that the matter was merely the Chamber of Commerce's financial matter and he only disbursed the funds, he regarded the latter as a private social engagement. However, after this court ordered the Qingdao District Court to investigate, the court summoned Wang Anfu, the representative of the bank, who testified that Yu Yaoxi had not visited Qingdao in the 14th year of the Republic [1925]. Therefore, Yu Yaoxi's claim of leaving Jinan is already unbelievable. Moreover, Yu Yaoxi, as the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, had already accounted for the 4,300 yuan as legitimate expenses, so there is no room for him to disclaim responsibility. Moreover, whether he left Jinan or not is not relevant. Furthermore, sending gifts to Zhang Zongchang's father, although a personal social engagement, cannot conceal his usual collusion. Judging from the clues before and after this event, Yu Yaoxi's printing of notices and maintaining the provincial currency undoubtedly showed his willingness to collaborate with the enemy. However, the public bond issue was in the 15th year of the Republic [1926]. At that time, the National Revolutionary Army had not yet arrived in Shandong. The funds raised were not for military needs to resist the National Revolutionary Army. Therefore, regardless of whether the public debt bureau issued it independently or Yu Yaoxi helped issue it, it is irrelevant to counter-revolution and need not be discussed in detail. (B) Embezzlement: (The charges were not established after the trial, so they are omitted). Regarding Li Shengsheng and Yang Zifeng: (Not accepted, omitted).</p>
<p>In summary, the defendant Yu Yaoxi, in addition to printing proclamations for Zhang Zongchang to maintain the warlord currency and providing counter-revolutionary funds, is not guilty of the other charges. His actions are equivalent to the provisions of Article 5 of the Provisional Law for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries. According to the same article and the provisions of Article 2 of the Special Criminal Laws and Regulations and the Criminal Calculation Standards, he should be punished with the main penalty and, according to Article 10 of the Provisional Law for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries and Article 9 and Article 57, Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Law, he should be punished with additional penalties. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined shall be deducted in accordance with Article 9 and Article 64 of the Criminal Law. The prosecution of the defendants Li Shengsheng and Yang Zifeng does not meet the requirements and should not be accepted. Therefore, in accordance with Article 315 and Article 318, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. The prosecutor of this court, Li Xuan, attended the court to perform his duties. The appeal court for this case is the Supreme Court. The appeal period is ten days, starting from the date of delivery of the judgment. [March 13th, 1930]</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Disbands All City Police Teams</h3>
<p>Stopping Operations on the 16th, Each Person Given Five Days' Pay and Dismissed</p>
<p>Police Team Firearms and Uniforms Separately Returned to the Government and Neighborhood Associations</p>
<p>From our correspondent in Guangzhou: The Guangzhou City Police Teams were established after the common catastrophe [likely referring to a period of unrest or conflict] two years ago. At that time, due to the aftermath of the upheaval, the city police teams under the jurisdiction of the Public Security Bureau were disbanded by the Communist Party, police equipment was lost, police stations were destroyed, and the citizens suddenly lost the protection of public security. Criminals committed arson, robbery, and theft every day, causing widespread panic. The neighborhood associations, for the sake of self-defense, organized joint street self-defense teams. The expenses of the self-defense teams and the purchase of firearms were all donated by shopkeepers. At that time, the task of the self-defense teams was no less than acting as the police force, and public order was maintained thanks to them. Later, the police of the Public Security Bureau were gradually recalled, guard posts were restored, and police equipment was also purchased anew by the Public Security Bureau through donations from shopkeepers. Last year, the Public Security Bureau ordered the cancellation of the self-defense teams and changed them to civilian police teams. Although the expenses were still borne by the merchants, the right to command and training had been transferred to the Public Security Bureau, effectively making it a government-supervised, privately run organization. The members of the civilian police team were still a transformed version of the former self-defense teams. Until recently, the Public Security Bureau, because the city's police administration was undergoing reforms and local security was becoming more peaceful, believed that the time to disband the civilian police teams had arrived.

<h3>New Invention of Natural Gas Lamps in Shantou</h3>
<p>The Inventor and Manufacturer is Luo Guorui</p>
<p>From our correspondent in Shantou: Mr. Luo Guorui of Shantou recently invented a type of natural gas lamp, which is installed at No. 43 Xinxing Road. Its light is bright and white, no different from a coal gas lamp, but it surpasses it in that it is silent and odorless. According to Mr. Luo, the use of natural gas can be used for burning stoves and cooking food, without smoke or odor, which is quite hygienic. Even small children can use it without any danger of fire. The analysis of the natural gas composition is as follows: carbon dioxide 24.6, carbon monoxide 0.8, heavy hydrocarbon 1.1, methane 63.8, oxygen 1.1, nitrogen 8.6. Because Mr. Luo invented it himself, he named it the "Guorui Style." Its characteristic is that the construction of the gas tank is completely different from the old style: (1) The tank lid is sealed to protect hygiene, (2) Water pressure is used to raise the gas, (3) A pump is used to stir the water to make the gas easier to generate, (4) A meter is used to measure the gas storage capacity. These are all characteristics of the Guorui Style natural gas. In addition, the raw materials for gas fermentation are exclusively various vegetable roots and leaves, potato and taro skins, fruits, rice water, rice bran, and other various plant-based decaying substances, truly making use of waste materials. The Wutian Railway Station and No. 43 Xinxing Street are all using this new and excellent gas lamp. Many people have been visiting it in recent days. It is said that Mr. Luo will apply to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for patent registration and recruit technicians to learn the method so that they can master it in the shortest time, send them to various counties, establish branches, and install the equipment for users.

<h3>Japanese Plan for a Korean-Manchurian Connection Network</h3>
<p>Aimed at Integrating Manchuria and Korea into One - Special Dispatch from the World Society, Shenyang: Recently, Japan's diplomatic policy toward China has shown a softening trend on the surface, shifting from tough to mild. In Manchuria, it abandoned its so-called "active policy" and advocated economic development. However, in reality, the means of aggression are still being pursued eagerly. Immigration, investment, and various plans are becoming increasingly concrete. Its softening penetration is especially frightening. In the past, Japan mainly used military aggression against Manchuria, followed by political means to expand its power. In recent years, it has changed to economic aggression to ease our opposition, which is the characteristic of the so-called Shidehara diplomacy. Its commercial and industrial forces in Manchuria already have an overwhelming advantage over Chinese merchants. Recently, the sharp drop in the price of Fengtian currency has resulted in Japanese financial capital gradually seizing control of the financial power of Manchuria. In addition, the railway policy is particularly noteworthy. Regarding railways, the Japanese have many plans, too numerous to list. The more important ones</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<p>Keep them even more secret. Recently, the South Manchuria Railway authorities announced the railway construction plan of the Korean Governor-General's Office. Judging from its content, it is truly astonishing. The Japanese call it the Korean-Manchurian Connection Railway Network Plan. Its purpose is to use the railway policy to integrate Korea and Manchuria into one. The contents of each line are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Andong-Dalian Direct Line: Starting from Andong, the starting point of the South Manchuria Railway, passing through various important coastal locations such as Datonggou and Longwangmiao, running parallel to the South Manchuria Railway line to Dalian.</p>
<p>2.  Jiangjie-Tonghua Line: Starting from Jiangjie in North Pyongan Province of Korea, passing through the Jian-An Line, all the way to Tonghua. The area along the line is rich in agricultural and mineral products.</p>
<p>3.  Kapsan-Fusong Line: Starting from Kapsan in South Hamgyong Province of Korea, passing through Changbai, all the way to Fusong in northern Manchuria. The area from Changbai to Fusong is Manchuria's only forest area.</p>
<p>4.  Kyongsong-Yanji Line: Starting from Kyongsong in North Hamgyong Province of Korea, to Yanji.</p>
<p>The above lines are all connecting Korea and Manchuria. If realized, the Japanese aggression force will become overwhelming and unstoppable. The continental policy in the Japanese ideal would completely succeed. What can the Chinese people do?</p>
<h3>Bandit Gang Plotting to Disturb Zhujing Has Been Dispersed</h3>
<p>He Yalin, the Captain of the First Public Security Team of the Songjiang Water Police, after the Shanghai-Nanjing passenger ship was robbed, immediately led his ships to pursue the bandits in the key passes of the southwest. According to investigations, the bandit gang that robbed the Shanghai-Nanjing passenger ship was led by Taibao Ashu. Recently, they have been gathering more and more people, and their firearms are quite sharp. They have been disturbing Xincang, Xinbang, Maogang and other places, openly and brazenly, and are extremely ferocious. There have been rumors of looting Zhujing and other towns, causing extreme panic among the residents. Captain He, in addition to reporting to the Minhang district headquarters, personally defended the areas and because Zhujing is the seat of the Jinshan County government, he and the county police team set up sentries every night. Unexpectedly, at dawn today (21st), the water police at a sentry post at Wulong Temple, about two li southeast of Zhujing, suddenly encountered a gang of bandits dressed as villagers, coming face to face in groups of three or five, all with Mauser pistols on their waists. As they approached, they opened fire. At once, bandits lurking in the fields rushed out from several directions, the sound of gunfire cracking and bullets raining down. Captain He, upon hearing the alarm, immediately supervised Liu Zigao, Gong Guozhen and other platoon leaders to dispatch their troops and along with the county police team to suppress them in multiple directions. The bandits advanced from both water and land, reportedly numbering over a thousand. Captain He dispatched another team by water to intercept the bandit ships, but they were ambushed by the bandits landing on shore from the rear, causing the bandit ships to escape. The two sides fought until noon, when the bandits began to retreat, fleeing from Huangqiao and Liulian, passing through Liwu, Hanjiayu and other places, and entering Mao through the No. 31 railway bridge. When the police and bandits were locked in battle, the patrol warship dispatched by the district headquarters, commanded by Inspector Zhang Yunfeng, opened fire, which intimidated the bandits. As the bandits retreated, He and Zhang pursued them closely from Liulian and other places, intercepting ten empty boats, with two dead bandit corpses inside and nothing else. Apparently, the bandits, seeing the water police warship chasing closely, abandoned their boats and fled ashore. They are currently still being pursued. It is reported that three members of the Jinshan County Police Team and one water policeman, who encountered dozens of retreating bandits in Huangqiao, had their guns stolen by the bandits. Arriving at the Songjiang Water Police Department, the police team reported that they had opened fire this morning until noon, killing more than ten bandits and wounding an equal number. The water police team also had one team member killed in action (belonging to the third platoon of the first team) and two wounded. The team also received a long-distance phone report at 2:00 PM from Liu Zigao, the platoon leader in Zhujing, saying that they were gathering the team. Although Fengjing is twenty-seven li away from Zhujing, the waterway is passable and communication is very convenient. Therefore, the gunfire in Zhujing was very clear. At once, rumors spread that the bandits were retreating into Fengjing to cause trouble. Last night, the security corps happened to arrest two bandit spies, who confessed that the bandit gang had a plan to disturb Fengjing. Upon hearing the gunfire in Zhujing, they immediately telegraphed the Songjiang County government to request that troops be sent to suppress them. The county magistrate of Jin immediately dispatched two platoons of the county police team and requested the army to travel to Fengjing by car to block them and assist in the suppression as the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>It is reported that Taibao Ashu is Qian Tianyun, a native of Qianjiawei. A year ago, he was still working in the countryside for the Zhuxian Camp [likely a local opera troupe]. Suddenly, he transformed into a bandit leader. Since establishing his gang in Xincang Yamen and other places last autumn, he initially had only several hundred people with few firearms. Now, he has been gathering more and more people, with dozens of ships, and cases of robbery, looting, and kidnapping are heard of every day. He calls himself the commander of the Third Division of the Jiangnan First Army. This morning, when Zhujing opened fire, it was said that the bandits had multiple hand-held machine guns and small steel cannons. Their momentum is truly not to be underestimated. The exact number of casualties in the water police team is still unconfirmed.</p>

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Removal of street signs and sunshades: Nanjiao Street is extremely narrow, and the signs of the shops protrude into the center of the street, obstructing traffic. In addition, the sunshades are built high, making it difficult for sunlight to enter, which hinders hygiene. The county government has repeatedly issued prohibitions, but they have not been implemented. Yesterday, County Magistrate Hong Benli personally supervised the county Public Security Bureau and persuaded the shops to remove them. They have been given a week to comply, after which the government will enforce the removal.</p>
<p>Proposal for joint coastal clean-up: County Magistrate Hong Ruisheng recently stated that theft cases have been occurring repeatedly everywhere, and their hiding places are mostly in collusion with local natives, wandering in the coastal areas. Because the area under the jurisdiction of the county government is vast and the jurisdictions are different, it is difficult to investigate on a regular basis, and it is not easy to search after the fact. Therefore, he advocates that the coastal areas should be jointly managed by the counties of Jinshan, Nanhui, Chuansha, Songjiang, Qingpu, Fengxian, and the Qingyuan and</p>
<p>Both Pu Sanchang [likely a reference to combined regions], as well as the water and land salt and police camps, to carry out a comprehensive clean-up plan. After seeking the consent of all parties on the methods and reasons, he submitted it to the province for review and approval.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Urgent Need to Establish a Historical Museum: The county magistrate of this region, Sun Zuji, believes that in order to preserve historical documents and artifacts and promote our inherent culture, a Wuxi County Historical Museum should be established.

After their visit, they returned to the city and, passing through Rongxiang Town, used a ten-yuan counterfeit banknote from the Jiaotong Bank to buy one yuan's worth of cigarettes at the Guxiangcun Grocery Store. The shop owner, Cao Liqing, gave them nine silver dollars in change. The Russians insisted on exchanging the change for one-yuan Jiaotong Bank notes. Cao then presented the banknotes for them to choose from, and the Russians seized the opportunity to steal twenty-nine yuan in banknotes and leave. Cao later realized what had happened and chased them by car to the railway hotel near the train station, where he apprehended the five Russians and handed them over to the County Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Verdict in the Case of Child Rape: Qin Guoliang, a tailor working at the Sanjian Tou workshop of the Fenjinji Silk Factory in the western part of this county, was accused by Zhou Qiu of fondling the private parts of her seven-year-old daughter, Agen, while she sat on his lap.

<p>Collecting Silk Products: The National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in order to promote domestic goods, received approval from the ministry to hold a national silk exhibition starting on April 15th, with a planned duration of one month. Since Wuxi is the richest area in terms of silk cocoon production, the hall's director, Yang Duo, specially sent Tang Ren'an, the head of the General Affairs Section, to Wuxi to collect products. He also engaged Chen Zhanru, acting chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, Qian Fengshang, chairman of the Silk Cocoon Trade Association, and Ms. Li Zhongrui, a sericulture expert, as collection commissioners. Director Tang arrived in Wuxi yesterday and immediately contacted the county government, the Chamber of Commerce, and the three collection commissioners, Chen, Qian, and Li, to jointly discuss methods for collecting products.</p>
<p>Request to Punish the Chief of the Municipal Public Works Section: The buildings on the west side of the Wuxi County Library are owned by the County Education Association and leased to the Lao Baohua Photo Studio. However, the building is old and dilapidated and in danger of collapsing. Lao Baohua requested repairs, and after instructing a craftsman, they went to the Public Works Section of the Municipal Preparatory Office to obtain a permit, but were refused. Subsequently, Qin Mianjun, Hu Nianqian, and Yan Shaoling, all standing committee members of the association, went to the Municipal Office's Public Works Section and explained the situation to Section Chief Zhu Shigui. Zhu replied that repairing buildings on major roads required compliance with specific dimensions and setbacks before construction could be permitted, but that minor roads were more flexible. The library's west side is on a minor road, and whether it was a major or minor repair, a construction permit could be granted. However, even after ten days, the permit had not been received. The association believes that the Municipal Public Works Section is deliberately obstructing the process through repeated delays. Yesterday, they specifically sent a letter to the Municipal Office requesting that Zhu Shigui, the chief of the Public Works Section, be promptly punished to maintain official integrity.</p>

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Two Ships Collide, Causing Mutual Damage: The Yaobei, a ship traveling between Ningbo and Zhoushan, loaded goods in Ningbo and set sail for Zhoushan at noon on the 18th. Around 1 PM, while passing through Aomeng Port, it collided with the Yongchuan, a ship sailing from Taizhou to Ningbo. The bow of the Yongchuan directly hit the stern of the Yaobei, causing the ship to shake violently. Zhou Ahua (21 years old), a hotel assistant from You County working in the rear of the ship's deck, fell into the water and drowned due to the impact. After the accident, the ship owners inspected their respective ships. The Yaobei had a small hole in the tail where it hit the ground, the right side door was knocked off, the iron railing at the rear of the deck was removed, and a male passenger inside the ship was injured by the collision. The Yongchuan was larger in size and suffered less damage. Yesterday, both ships sailed back to Ningbo. The Yongchuan can sail after minor repairs. The Yaobei needs to be repaired in dry dock and will be temporarily replaced by the Cibei.</p>
<p>Villagers Destroy Public Security Bureau: Villagers from various villages in the Lindong and Linxi districts of Yuyao gathered at Wushan Temple on the 15th day of the old calendar to welcome the local deity. The Henghe Public Security Bureau, which had jurisdiction over the area, sent police to prohibit this, but they were disobeyed, and the patrol leader was beaten. Since the incident, the villagers in the district remained resentful and discussed gathering to destroy the Henghe Public Security Bureau. The County Public Security Bureau dispatched patrol officer Wu Guobiao and eight police officers to be stationed at the bureau to assist in defense. The Wushan Temple continued to be noisy with drums and music, greatly welcoming the local deity. Around 5 PM on the 18th, more than 20,000 people welcoming the deity traveled from east to west to the Henghe area. In order to maintain the authority of the Public Security Bureau, the Henghe Public Security Bureau sent people to dissuade the crowd and ordered the chief police officer to observe the situation with live ammunition. A portion of the welcoming crowd gathered in front of the Public Security Bureau, clenching their fists and looking like they were about to fight. At that time, the police on duty saw two large Qing Dynasty dragon flags flying in the air among the welcoming flags. They stepped forward to interfere, and an argument broke out. The police officers were insulted and beaten. For self-defense, the police fired shots into the air and took down the dragon flags to hand them over to the bureau. The crowd in front of the bureau dispersed. However, around 10 PM that night, the deity-welcoming crowd retaliated, gathering about a hundred thugs armed with iron rulers, wooden sticks, and other weapons. They rushed into the bureau, beating anyone they saw and smashing anything they could find. Seeing that the situation was not good, all the chief police officers fled through the back door. The thugs completely destroyed the offices and the bureau chief's bedroom and set fire to the police's luggage, clothes, firearms, and all official documents. Bureau Chief Tu and Patrol Officer Xu immediately went to the city to meet County Magistrate Miao and report the incident. The county magistrate dispatched a platoon of security guards and 24 police officers, led by Patrol Officer Xu Guoliang, to suppress the situation in the countryside and telegraphed the province for instructions. It is unknown how this will be resolved.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from the Liaison Office of the 12th Division in Beijing</h3>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have read the news from Hong Kong in the "National Important Telegrams" column on page 4 of yesterday's (19th) edition of your newspaper, regarding the activities of the Communist Party in Haifeng. It stated (various groups in Nanxiong telegraphed the province on the 17th, saying that the communists had captured Ganzhou on the evening of the 16th).</p>
<p>Upon investigation, Ganzhou is garrisoned by the 70th Regiment of our Division. Although there have been recent reports of communists attempting to seize the city, the statement that it fell on the evening of the 16th is definitely not true. Our office received several telegrams from Ganzhou on the afternoon of the 17th. We have also received telegrams from Deputy Division Commander Tang on both days, and there was no mention of Ganzhou being captured. This shows that the news reported from Hong Kong is clearly hearsay and inaccurate. We ask that you correct this immediately to restore the truth.</p>

In recent years, the government has organized a committee to study and discuss solutions in detail. Currently, the investigation materials and proposed plans are already somewhat in order. In the future, when the plan has been fully considered, the Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee must formally submit it to the government for approval and promulgation. The Ministry of Finance can then proceed step by step according to the promulgated plan. Before this plan is approved and promulgated, the Ministry of Finance does not have the authority to resolve any debts or the debts of any debt groups.</p>

<h3>The Case of Banning Nanyang People's Letter Offices - A Telegram from the Overseas Chinese Progress Association</h3>
<p>If a Ban is Necessary</p>
<p>Request a Reduction in Postal Rates</p>
<p>The Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications' ban on Nanyang Overseas Chinese People's Letter Offices was first met with strong opposition from overseas Chinese in Singapore, who organized the Singapore Petition to Retain People's Letter Offices, a full overseas Chinese representative conference, to petition the Ministry of Communications to retain them. Details have been published in newspapers. So far, the Ministry of Communications has not made any statement. The Overseas Chinese Progress Association has taken this matter seriously and sent a telegram to the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Nanjing and the Ministry of Communications. The text of the telegram to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the esteemed Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Nanjing, urgent. We have learned that the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications' ban on Nanyang People's Letter Offices has caused panic among overseas Chinese. First, the entire overseas Chinese community in Singapore jointly petitioned for their retention. The various overseas Chinese newspapers in Nanyang and the local newspapers have successively published reports on this matter. So far, we have not seen the Ministry of Communications release any concrete measures. According to the points raised in the petition from the Singapore Petition to Retain People's Letter Offices, a full overseas Chinese representative conference, to the Ministry of Communications, they are indeed factual. We earnestly request your Commission to relay this to the Ministry of Communications, to understand the feelings of overseas Chinese, to uphold the spirit of the Party and the Nation's repeated declarations to alleviate the suffering of overseas Chinese, and to find ways to retain them. As a compromise, if the banning of People's Letter Offices is unavoidable, the request from the representative conference should be granted: a reduction in postal rates, with overseas postage at six cents and domestic postage at five cents, to ease the burden on the working overseas Chinese, so as not to completely disappoint our overseas Chinese who have long loved the Party and the Nation, and cause them to doubt that the Party and the Nation's declarations of caring for the suffering of overseas Chinese are mere empty words. We urgently present our case, and await your instructions with trepidation. The Overseas Chinese Progress Association, Ma Yunyun.</p>

<h3>Chinese Authorities Refute the Remarks of the General Manager of the Gas Company</h3>
<p>The Comments Run Counter to the Facts</p>
<p>The Wenhui Daily reported the other day (the 20th) that, due to serious negotiations between the Chinese authorities and the Shanghai Gas Company, the newspaper sent a representative to meet with the company's General Manager, Mr. Cuming, to inquire about the details. Mr. Cuming expressed his opinion, saying that the company supplies gas to 20 foreign households in Zhabei, and the Chinese authorities requested a share of the profits. The company paid 1,000 taels of silver per year as a road excavation fee, until last year. Later, due to repeated requests from the Public Utilities Bureau, the payments were stopped on April 4th of last year, before the shareholders' meeting. He also said that the company treats the authorities of the Chinese and Concession areas equally. If foreign residents and other users outside the Concession area use gas, the Chinese side's request for a share of the profits is not justified. It is reported that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, seeing this news and the responsible statement of the company's General Manager, has prepared to question the company about its fallacies. The main points are as follows: (1) On April 4th of the 18th year, Mr. Baker, the company's acting engineer, stated in a letter that the total length of the gas main pipes buried by the company in Zhabei was 28,770 feet, supplying gas to 300 households. In the 17th year, the average monthly gas sales were 2,340,660 cubic feet. Among the Chinese users, the Nanyang Printing House alone spent over 22,700 yuan on gas in the 16th year, which increased to over 29,800 yuan in the 17th year. However, Mr. Cuming said that gas was supplied to 20 households, and they were all foreigners. The discrepancy with the facts is enormous. (2) The public sector repairs the roads excavated by the company for burying and repairing pipes, and should pay fees accordingly. The company has always paid such fees to the Concession authorities, but deliberately delayed payments in the Chinese area. Cases before the establishment of the Municipality are not discussed. In the 16th year, the total road excavation fee paid was 175 yuan, 0.015 cents. From January to June of the 17th year, the road excavation fee was 660 yuan, 0.08 cents, which was paid in January of the 18th year after repeated reminders. From June to December of the 17th year, all the excavated road surfaces have been repaired by the Municipality, and the outstanding amount of 1,353 yuan, 0.69 cents has been repeatedly demanded, but has not been paid yet. In February of the 18th year, the company excavated roads on Dongbaoxing Road without permission to repair pipes, without paying fees or applying for permits. The company operates in the Chinese area, but disregards Chinese laws and regulations. How can this be justified? However, Mr. Cuming said that the company paid a road excavation fee of 1,000 taels per year (the road excavation fee is determined by the size of the excavated road surface, and there is no reason to fix it annually) until one day last year, and claimed that it was the Chinese authorities who requested a share of the profits. The discrepancy with the facts is even greater. (3) The company pays 1,000 taels of silver to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession and 210 taels to the Public Works Department of the French Concession every year. However, it has always enjoyed rights and not fulfilled obligations in the Chinese area. Only recently, during contract negotiations, was it agreed that the annual business tax and land use fee would be about 400 yuan. However, the contract has not been signed yet, and it is unknown when the tax will be paid. From this alone, Mr. Cuming's statement that the company treats the authorities of the Chinese and Concession areas equally is contradictory. (4) When the Municipal Government and public utilities companies sign contracts, on the one hand, it is a necessary procedure to exercise its authority, and on the other hand, it is to ensure that the company's business and the interests of the citizens are not in conflict. It is by no means a purely tax issue. The company should abide by government laws and regulations, and the government should provide corresponding protection. This applies to Chinese merchants in the city, and foreign merchants should not be an exception. Based on this principle, the Public Utilities Bureau has repeatedly consulted with the company to sign a contract, and has also realized that the company often disregards public orders and acts freely, which is not allowed to be delayed. The contract has been substantially agreed upon at the meeting on January 29th of this year, and the company has agreed to all the conditions proposed. The company deliberately delayed the signing only because it requested exemption from the outstanding road excavation fee of 1,457 yuan, which was rejected by the Bureau. Therefore, the Bureau set a deadline for completing the contract signing procedures. It is unknown what Mr. Cuming meant by "the Chinese requested a share of the profits." If the signing of the contract and payment of 400 yuan in taxes is considered a share of the profits, then what is the purpose of the company paying 1,000 taels to the Public Concession and 210 taels to the French Concession every year? Currently, the Chinese authorities have repeatedly extended the deadline for signing the contract, while the company has repeatedly postponed it. Therefore, the responsibility for the delay in signing the contract and all other responsibilities should be borne by the company.</p>
<p>In order to clarify the contents of the contract for readers, the draft contract that has been negotiated by both parties but not yet signed is recorded below:</p>
<p>Draft Contract between the Shanghai Special Municipality Government and the Shanghai Gas Company. The Shanghai Special Municipality Government (hereinafter referred to as the "Municipal Government") and the Shanghai Gas Company (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") hereby enter into the following articles of agreement because the Municipal Government allows the Company to continue to supply gas within the city. (1) The Company may install branch pipes at the locations of gas meters installed by gas users within the city and connect them to the main pipe, but only within the existing main pipe (as shown in the diagram). Without the permission of the Municipal Government, no additional main pipes may be installed, or the existing main pipes may be lengthened or enlarged. The Company shall draw a line diagram of the existing main pipes, indicating the location, length, and diameter of the gas pipes, which shall be verified and approved by the Municipal Government and attached to this contract as proof. (2) The Company shall pay the Municipal Government an annual business tax of 280 yuan in national currency every January. This amount is calculated based on the annual use of 70 million cubic feet of gas. If the amount of gas used increases, the amount of business tax shall also increase accordingly. The Company shall be exempt from all other existing or future taxes within the city. (3) The Company shall pay the Municipal Government a land use fee for burying gas pipes and using public land according to the following table:</p>
<p>Diameter in Millimeters - Annual Land Use Fee per Meter (Approximate)</p>
<p>2 inches (50.8 mm) - 0.001 Yuan</p>
<p>3 inches (76.2 mm) - 0.003 Yuan</p>
<p>4 inches (101.6 mm) - 0.005 Yuan</p>
<p>6 inches (152.4 mm) - 0.013 Yuan</p>
<p>9 inches (228.6 mm) - 0.029 Yuan</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>(4) During the term of this contract, the price charged by the Company for selling gas within the city shall not exceed the price charged by the Company in the Public Concession. (5) The Municipal Government shall provide reasonable protection to the Company's employees and workers when working on roads within the city, provided that they carry a road excavation permit issued by the Municipal Public Works Bureau. The permit shall be presented upon request. (6) The Municipal Government shall not collect any additional taxes from the Company's gas users in the city on the grounds of their use of gas. However, if a user refuses to pay the Municipal Government's house tax, the Municipal Government may notify the Company to stop supplying gas (until the tax is paid in full). Upon receiving the notification, the Company shall immediately comply. (7) If the Company wishes to excavate roads to bury or repair gas pipes or to construct gas-related projects, it shall first fill out a road excavation request form as prescribed by the Municipal Government and submit it to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, which shall forward it to the Municipal Public Works Bureau for the issuance of a permit before work can begin. The road excavation fee shall be paid by the Company to the Municipal Public Works Bureau in accordance with regulations. However, if the Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that it interferes with other buildings, the Company shall stop work or change the construction method and shall strictly comply with the road excavation regulations stipulated by the Municipal Public Works Bureau. (8) The cost of relocating old and new gas pipes buried by the Company or other gas-related projects shall be borne in accordance with the following regulations: (A) For all gas pipes or other gas-related projects freely buried by the Company before the establishment of this contract, if the Municipal Government deems it necessary to relocate or demolish them, the Company shall immediately comply as scheduled upon notification by the competent bureau. All road excavation fees and pipe removal fees shall be borne entirely by the Company. (B) For gas pipes or other gas-related projects buried after the establishment of this contract, if the Municipal Government deems it necessary to relocate or demolish them, in addition to the Company complying as scheduled, (1) if the relocation is required due to the construction of sewers, the pipe removal fee shall be borne by the Company and the road excavation fee shall be borne by the Municipal Government. If the deadline is exceeded, all fees shall be borne by the Company. (2) If the relocation is required due to other construction, all pipe removal fees and road excavation fees may be borne by the Municipal Government. If the deadline is exceeded, they shall still be borne by the Company. (C) If the Company relocates or repairs pipelines or other gas-related projects on its own, all pipe removal fees and road excavation fees shall be borne by the Company. (9) The gas pipe between the main pipe and the user's gas meter shall be connected by the Company. (10) The Company's employees may enter the gas user's premises or on the road at any time to check the gas meter and other gas appliances. If the user fails to pay the gas fee or steals gas, the Company's employees may close the gas pipe, remove the gas meter, and remove various gas equipment. However, the Company's employees must carry a certificate issued by the Company when performing the above duties. The certificate shall be presented upon request. (11) In order to ensure that the Company's gas projects in the city are carried out in accordance with the provisions of this contract, a deposit shall be placed with the Municipal Government. The amount shall be calculated based on 5% of the value of the existing gas pipelines in the city, which is 26,000 taels, totaling 1,820 yuan in national currency. If the pipelines increase in the future, the deposit shall be supplemented according to the increased amount at the end of each year. The deposit shall be returned upon presentation of the receipt on the date of termination of the contract. If the Company violates any of the provisions of this contract or refuses to pay the fees, the Municipal Government may deduct the amount from the deposit at any time and notify the Company to pay the full amount. This deposit shall be stored in a special account in the municipal treasury bank designated by the Municipal Government. The interest given by the bank shall be paid in full to the Company, according to the bank's usual practice, at the beginning of January and July each year. (12) If a gas plant is built within the city, the Company's business rights within the city shall be terminated immediately. All its equipment shall be purchased by the gas plant within the city at the current market price. The price shall be estimated by experts and determined by mutual agreement. (13) The term of this contract shall be ten years from the date of signing. If the Company wishes to continue its business, it shall notify the Municipal Government in writing six months before the expiration date to negotiate a new contract. (14) This contract shall be made in duplicate, with each party holding one copy. Both versions shall be in Chinese.</p>
<h3>Two Recent Works of the Municipal Health Bureau</h3>
<p>Situation of Promoting Free Vaccination in the Spring of the 19th Year. Promoting free vaccination to prevent the spread of smallpox is one of the important tasks stipulated by the central government's epidemic prevention measures. This city has made every effort to promote it in the spring and winter seasons for many years. In the past three years, more than 233,000 people have received free vaccinations. This spring, it will continue to be promoted as before. As it is known that residents in makeshift sheds are more prone to smallpox, this year's free vaccination promotion will focus on makeshift sheds. The Municipal Government has instructed the Public Security Bureau to order districts to cooperate and urge makeshift sheds to accept the Health Bureau's free vaccination. The household registration section of the Public Security Bureau will report the population of makeshift sheds in the city, and the Health Bureau will compile a vaccination schedule. All vaccine materials are purchased and used by the Health Bureau and no money is collected from the citizens. The staff members are insufficient as the original epidemic prevention section staff of the Health Bureau are not enough to allocate. The Health Bureau has especially requested the Epidemic Prevention Department of the Ministry of Health to send two staff members to assist in the progress. As for the residents in the makeshift sheds, due to their shallow knowledge and stubbornness, even though the Public Security Bureau has issued publicity materials such as pictures and explanations made by the Health Bureau on behalf of the Health Bureau, many people still wait and see when going for vaccination. After several times of guidance, most of the children in the makeshift sheds have been vaccinated, but adult men and women still refuse. According to the original goal set by the Health Bureau, it was originally intended to vaccinate all citizens in the makeshift sheds. However, due to the circumstances, it may only be able to achieve one-quarter of the goal. It has now instructed epidemic prevention personnel to consult with various districts and take a slightly coercive approach to remedy the ineffectiveness of persuasion. Since vaccinating makeshift sheds, there have been more than 8,000 households, with a total population of more than 40,000. Currently, 11,655 people have actually been vaccinated, which is about one-quarter of the total population of makeshift sheds in the past. It is still being promoted.</p>
<p>Situation of Checking and Assisting Neighboring Areas in Preventing Meningitis. The Health Bureau sent a letter in February stating that there were reports of epidemics in Xinzhuang and other places in Songjiang. Considering that Xinzhuang is adjacent to this city, the Health Bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate. After confirming the epidemic as epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, the Health Bureau immediately sent personnel to guide the district sub-office and the Public Security Bureau in the preparation of preventive measures, and publicly lectured on preventive and treatment methods in tea houses. With the approval of the district public office, personnel were sent to inject cerebrospinal meningitis vaccine. At the same time, strict precautions were taken in Meilong and Caojing, which are adjacent to Xinzhuang and other places in this city. The district party department was requested to send a letter and notified the municipal committee office to publicize as much as possible to promote citizens' attention to prevention. The bureau sent police to inject preventive needles, totaling 2,294 people. Unexpectedly, there was also a meningitis epidemic in Baoshan, and they came to the bureau for assistance. In addition to assisting and guiding prevention methods, due to limited funding and personnel, they were overwhelmed. The Ministry was telegraphed to ask the Jiangsu Provincial Government to jointly plan to eliminate the epidemic and present the city government to send a document to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to send personnel to various places to prevent and block the spread, so as not to affect the current. The epidemic situation in Xinzhuang and Baoshan has gradually disappeared. According to the reports from various places in this city, there are a total of 105 patients with meningitis and more than 30 deaths. Fortunately, there was no major harm. In order to protect, the free injection of Wufang vaccine was carried out. The Trade Union Preparatory Office was responsible for publicity and persuasion, and the Health Bureau staff was responsible for the implementation of the injection. A total of more than 3,000 people have been injected. Citizens who have a gathering of more than 30 people can also have the bureau send personnel to provide free injections. In total, since the Health Bureau discovered the occurrence of meningitis this year, it has provided free injections of preventive vaccine to 8,641 people by March 18, and is still continuing to do so.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Affairs Section of the Public Security Bureau Will Move to the Bureau to Work on a Regular Basis</h3>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Section of the Second Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau was temporarily borrowing the trial site of the former Jiangsu Diplomatic Commissioner's Office. Now, for the convenience of official business, the bureau has decided to move the office of the section to the bureau in Dadongmen, Zhonghua Road, Nanshi, from April 1. It also announced that from now on, all matters related to registration, passport visa certification, and other foreign affairs matters handled by the bureau must be directly contacted and handled by the Foreign Affairs Section of the Second Division of the bureau.</p>
<h3>The Port Affairs Bureau is Planning to Build the Dongtang Rong Zi Hao Seawall</h3>
<p>The Dongtang Rong Zi Hao Seawall is located at the point where the Dabeibeiliu River flows straight. The seawall is steep and in a precarious situation. Every time during the spring and autumn floods, the tides surge, which is extremely dangerous. Although stones have been filled in the pile of the section to soften the tide, it is a temporary solution and not a long-term plan. If reinforcement work is not carried out quickly, once the wind and flood arrive, the collapse and discharge are inevitable. For the sake of long-term benefit, the Municipal Port Affairs Bureau plans to build a reinforced concrete revetment immediately, which is 106.2 zhang long, with an estimated cost of about 50,435 yuan. This plan has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, and construction will begin as soon as the funds are available.</p>
<h3>Jin Wensi Takes Over as Director of the Agricultural Inspection Institute</h3>
<p>The director of the Shanghai Agricultural Product Inspection Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining was originally concurrently held by Xu Tinghu, director of the Department of Agricultural Administration. As the institute is now at the beginning of its establishment, it has repeatedly received orders from the Ministry to expand the area for inspecting fertilizers and to plan for the inspection of diseases and pests. Great progress has been made. Recently, the Central Political Conference also resolved that the inspection and registration of rice and grain imported, exported, and transshipped in Shanghai should also be under the jurisdiction of the institute. Everything is to be done, and it is impossible without a full-time director stationed in Shanghai to preside over the work. Xu resigned from his concurrent post to Yi Buchang, the Minister, due to the heavy workload of the Department of Agricultural Administration and the many days spent in Beijing, which made it difficult for him to concurrently handle the affairs of the Shanghai Institute. It is reported that Yi Buchang has approved the resignation and has appointed Jin Wensi, the newly appointed counselor of the Ministry, to succeed him. After receiving the appointment, Jin went to the institute yesterday afternoon to take office. Cai Wuji, the deputy director of the institute, led all the staff members to hold a meeting to welcome him. Jin gave a speech to all the staff members, stating that the institute has made considerable achievements since its opening last year, such as its efforts in inspecting fertilizers, which will continue in the future. Other matters that should be rectified and initiated should also be actively carried out. In particular, the inspection and registration of rice and grain should be carried out diligently in accordance with the central government's intentions. The purpose of the institute's inspection of agricultural products is to improve the quality of agricultural products, increase the production of agricultural products, and eliminate diseases of agricultural products, so as to develop agricultural production and protect the interests of farmers, and is not comparable to tax collection agencies. He hoped that all members of the institute would recognize the goal and work together to live up to the expectations of the Minister. Then Deputy Director Cai made a welcome speech on behalf of all the staff members, and the meeting was dismissed with tea and refreshments.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Shipping Conference Decides on Draft Shipping Law</h3>
<p>Will be Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Approval</p>

The draft will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval.</p>
<h3>Chinese Again Rejected by Japan</h3>
<p>Chinese going to Japan, recently due to Japan implementing new restrictive regulations, therefore the Chinese of Shanghai traveling to Japan have often been expelled by the Japanese. Yesterday, another large group of Chinese were prohibited from landing by the Japanese and forced to return to their country. The details of this matter are investigated and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>New Restrictive Regulations: The Japanese, strictly refusing Chinese to enter Japan, have already employed various methods, either using monetary restrictions or joint guarantees. They stop at nothing to exclude Chinese from entering Japan. Now, they have issued new regulations: they only permit Chinese to leave Japan and do not allow additional Chinese to enter. Each Japanese port's water police station issues a type of entry certificate, limited to Chinese already working in Japan who receive it when returning to their country. For example, Chinese in Japan who wish to return to China must obtain this certificate, otherwise, they will not be allowed to return to that country again. Since the implementation of this regulation, those traveling to Japan without a certificate have been rejected and returned.</p>
<p>Prepayment of Passage Fare: Various Japanese steamship companies, knowing that Chinese passengers without water police certificates cannot go to Japan, still collect forty gold dollars in advance from Chinese passengers bound for Japan as a deposit to cover the cost of a return ticket on the original ship back to Shanghai in case of rejection. Therefore, recently expelled Chinese have all prepaid their passage fares, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<p>Strict Inspection: According to the Japanese, the current strict prohibition of Chinese entering Japan by the Japanese authorities is because, on the tenth of this month, when a certain ship entered port, sixty or seventy Chinese were discovered attempting to enter Japan by blending in, some posing as businessmen, others falsely claiming to be students. They are currently being detained and will be sent back to Shanghai in batches within the next ten days. At present, the water police in Kobe, Nagasaki, Nagoya, and Yokohama are conducting extremely strict inspections of Chinese disembarking.</p>
<p>Expelled and Returned: Yesterday, the Japanese steamship Nagasaki Maru arrived in Shanghai with Chinese passengers Yan Defu, Cai Youliu, Guo Junnan, Lin Chuanlu, Kong Fengchun, Ge Yingqi, Yang Zuoxun, Wu Yinglai, Lin Chunshou, Yan Deshun, Zhan Jingfeng, and sixteen others. Due to violating the newly issued restrictive regulations, they were all prohibited from landing. Most of them are kimono merchants. It is understood that they arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Furthermore, according to Japanese sources, the Japanese authorities have newly decided to absolutely prohibit all Chinese overseas workers from landing and will make no exceptions for those without certificates.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Kasado Maru Accident</h3>
<p>The Japanese ship Kasado Maru, this time carrying a large batch of cargo from Japan to Shanghai, was damaged in a collision immediately after leaving Japan. The cargo has suffered significant losses. The various details heard are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Damaged in Kobe: The Japanese postal company's Kasado Maru, departing from Osaka and Kobe in Japan, fully loaded with passengers and cargo for Shanghai, was scheduled to arrive yesterday afternoon. Yesterday, the Shanghai branch received a telegram from Japan stating that the Kasado Maru collided with an incoming Japanese ship on the sixteenth after departing from Kobe. A large hole was created in the outer hull of the Kasado Maru, and seawater rushed into the cabin, significantly increasing the ship's weight, causing it to sink. At that time, the shipowner, Iwashita Totaro, urgently telegraphed the Kobe branch to send a ship to the port to tow the Kasado Maru back to Kobe to unload the cargo for major repairs.</p>
<p>Significant Cargo Damage: The Kasado Maru was carrying over a thousand tons of cargo destined for Shanghai, including a large quantity of cotton yarn and piece goods, all ordered by Chinese merchants. The cargo was originally scheduled to be unloaded yesterday. After the collision, the seawater flooded one of the cargo holds, causing significant water damage. Currently, the cargo is being unloaded, and the company has decided to transfer both the damaged and undamaged goods to the Mikasa Maru for transport to Shanghai, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd. The extent of the losses will be inspected again during unloading. The passengers on board have also been transferred to the Mikasa Maru for transport to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Notice to Consignees: Yesterday, the Japanese postal company in Shanghai issued a notice to all cargo owners and consignees, stating that the Kasado Maru was unfortunately damaged, and the cargo on board was damaged as a result. The matter will be handled according to the General Average. Consignees are requested to submit the relevant documents related to the General Average to the company before the 23rd for processing. Notification regarding damaged goods will be provided after inspection.</p>
<h3>Xiangchang Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>Factory Provides Compensation for Injuries and Deaths</p>
<p>The Xiangchang Cotton Mill, which previously declared closure due to operational losses, led to a labor dispute. Many workers were shot and injured by detectives from the French Concession Police, including worker Xing Youcheng, who died on the spot. The municipal Party and government immediately decided on a solution, sending representatives to negotiate with the factory. It is now heard that the case has been peacefully resolved between labor and management. The factory will increase subsidies for each worker by seventy yuan. For the deceased, Xing Youcheng, the factory will provide a one-time compensation of one thousand five hundred yuan. For the five seriously injured, each will receive sixty yuan for medical expenses. For the eleven slightly injured, each will receive fifteen yuan. It is also heard that the agreement has been certified by lawyer Zheng Yuxiu. The compensation payments have already been collected by the families of the injured and deceased.</p>

<h3>Rescheduling of "Never Afraid of Death" Case</h3>
<p>Overcrowded Courtroom</p>
<p>Listeners Remained Even After Rescheduling</p>
<p>The "Never Afraid of Death" talkie shown at the Da Guangming Theater, which insulted Chinese people, led to the lawsuit filed by Hong Shen. The American Consul also attended the previous temporary court hearing.</p>
<p>The plaintiff's lawyer expressed his objection. After adjourning that day, the lawyer submitted a written statement detailing the reasons why the American Consul had no right to attend the hearing, as reported previously. The case was originally scheduled to be heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Gao Junxiang in the Seventh Court. However, even before two o'clock, people arrived to listen, and the courtroom was packed. Only the lawyer's seats were empty. By 2:15, neither the plaintiffs, defendants, nor their lawyers had arrived, and the arrest warrant had not been seen. Many listeners began to speculate. Later, a court clerk announced that the case would be rescheduled. However, the listeners did not believe it, and not only did they not leave, but more people arrived, demonstrating the public's concern for the case. Until 2:45, court officials again announced to the crowd that the case had indeed been rescheduled and would not be heard today. At that time, the listeners dispersed, but some remained skeptical and hesitated to leave the area outside the Seventh Court.</p>
<h3>Two Men Competing for One Wife</h3>
<p>Court Orders Plaintiff to Sue in an Inland Court</p>
<p>Wen Zhou woman Pan Li, in October of last year, betrothed her eighteen-year-old daughter, Pan Jinmei, through a matchmaker to Zhang Peigen, a servant. They resided in Deshun Lane in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, in December, Li enticed her daughter out and remarried her to Sun Jiansheng. They lived together in Hongci Lane in the Southern City. Zhang Peigen found out, went to reclaim Jinmei, and Sun Jiansheng, along with his mother-in-law Pan Li, went to Zhang's place to demand Jinmei back, leading to a dispute and verbal argument. They were taken to the French Police Station, where Pan Jinmei testified that she only recognized Sun as her husband and denied marrying Zhang. The judge ordered them to wait for further investigation. Yesterday, they were brought in for questioning again. The plaintiff, Zhang Peigen, hired a lawyer to represent him, stating that the defendant, Pan Li's daughter, was betrothed to the plaintiff, Zhang Peigen, through a matchmaker in October of last year and married at 380 Changbang Road. There is a marriage certificate as proof. He asked the court to sentence the first defendant, Pan Jinmei, for bigamy, the second defendant, Pan Li, for abetting, and the third defendant, Sun Jiansheng, for enticing. He also requested the return of the betrothal gifts and jewelry. In this time of declining morals, this trend cannot be allowed to continue. He asked the court to punish them according to the law. Pan Jinmei testified that although she had a love affair and lived with Zhang Peigen, they were not formally married. Sun Jiansheng testified that he and Jinmei were married in December of last year in the Zuibaixuan garden on Doushi Street in Gaoxiangtou and have a marriage certificate as proof. Judge Zhu, after reviewing the evidence, stated that since the defendant Pan Jinmei and Sun Jiansheng were married inland, the plaintiff, Zhang Peigen, should file a lawsuit in the appropriate court.</p>
<h3>Two Concubines Fighting Over Deceased Husband's Estate</h3>
<p>Awaiting Submission of Account Books for Further Review</p>
<p>Ningbo native Zhang Meizhen, during his lifetime, founded the Meitai Company in Deming Lane, Jixiang Street, in the French Concession, specializing in Sichuan-Han general merchandise, and was quite well-off. Zhang passed away due to illness on the first day of the twelfth month of the lunar calendar last year, leaving behind two concubines, Zhang Li and Zhang Zhao, and a daughter, Zhang Lianzhu, residing at No. 8 Qing'anfang, Xicang Road, within the West Gate. Zhang Zhao and others hired lawyer Zhu to file a lawsuit with the local court, requesting a division of property. Their statement roughly stated that the husband died without an heir, and the concubine monopolized the estate. They requested an equitable distribution according to the law. The plaintiff stated that she married the deceased husband Zhang Meizhen as a second wife through a matchmaker in April of the eighth year of the Republic of China at the Hongyunlou on Avenue Edward VII, and they lived together in Yufuli, Nanyang Bridge, in a harmonious relationship. At the age of twenty-six, in September of the eleventh year of the Republic of China, they moved to No. 8 Qing'anfang, Xicang Road, within the West Gate, and lived with the husband's concubine Li (the defendant). Li was in charge of daily life. Unexpectedly, the deceased husband Zhang Meizhen fell ill in November of last year's lunar calendar and passed away on the first day of the twelfth month. Zhang Xiangcheng, a member of the clan, and others decided to adopt Zhang Xianxiang, a nephew, as an heir. It was found that the husband had operated the Meitai Company, selling Sichuan-Han general merchandise in Deming Lane, French Concession. Zhang Xianding, the husband's nephew, had worked in the Meitai Company for many years and was fully aware of the situation in the company. On New Year's Eve, the defendant Zhang Li, colluding with the husband's nephew Zhang Xianding, took all the account books from the Meitai Company. She then learned that there were over eleven thousand taels of silver in the account, deposited at the Hongkang Sichuan trade company on Wangping Street, Sima Road. After repeatedly consulting a lawyer, she obtained a reply confirming the deposit. Therefore, she requested that the eleven thousand taels of silver be divided into four shares. The defendant Zhang Li also hired lawyer Yao Jian to present a defense, arguing that the question of the wife was incorrect. The plaintiff claimed to have married the deceased husband in the eighth year of the Republic of China, but did not provide evidence of a matchmaker. She claimed to have been formally married but rented a house outside in Fuyuli. The defendant had been married for many years. After the deceased husband's wife Chen passed away, she left behind a young daughter, Lianzhu, who was raised by the defendant. The husband had an affair with the plaintiff outside, and she became arrogant. The defendant was the legal wife but was treated as a concubine. The husband did not adopt Zhang Xianxiang as an heir. The defendant requested that the claims be rejected. Yesterday afternoon at two o'clock, presiding judge Ge Zhitan specially opened the Fourth Court to hear the case. The plaintiff Zhang Zhao testified that she was thirty-four years old, from Kunshan, and resided at No. 8 Qing'anfang, Xiangcang Road. (Judge asked) Who was Zhang Meizhen to you? (Answer) He was my husband. (Judge asked) Who is the defendant Zhang Li to your husband? (Answer) She is also a member of the family. (Judge asked) Are there any differences between the family members? (Answer) When I married him, I was told that his first wife had died, and I was the remarriage. I did not know that there was still the defendant Zhang Li. We are not distinguished by rank. (Judge asked) Why are you suing this time? (Answer) I am requesting that the eleven thousand taels of silver left by the deceased husband be divided into four shares. The plaintiff should receive one-fourth, the adopted son Zhang Xianxiang should also receive one-fourth, and the remaining two shares should go to the defendant Zhang Li and Zhang Lianzhu. (Judge asked) When did the defendant enter the family before you? (Answer) Not long before. (Judge asked) You and Zhang Xianxiang want to divide five thousand five hundred taels? (Answer) Yes, it is currently deposited in the Hongkang Company. (Judge asked) Is Qing'anfang, where you currently live, a big house or a small house? (Answer) It is a rented three-story house. (Judge asked) Who is in charge of the house? (Answer) When my husband was alive, I was in charge. After my husband died, I didn't manage it anymore. (Judge asked) How many years ago did Chen die? (Answer) She died fourteen years ago. (Judge asked) Did your husband have any children? (Answer) No, only Chen had a daughter named Lianzhu, who is fourteen years old this year. (Judge asked) When you married him, what did he say? (Answer) He said that I was to be the wife. Then, the plaintiff Zhang Xianxiang testified that he was twenty-two years old, from Ningbo, and currently resided at No. 8 Qing'anfang. (Judge asked) Who was Zhang Meizhen to you? (Answer) He was my foster uncle. I became his adopted son when I was nine years old. Last year, my foster father passed away. I held his head during the coffin ceremony, Lianzhu held his feet, and I wore mourning clothes. (Judge asked) Is Lianzhu his biological daughter? (Answer) Yes. (Judge asked) Was Chen still alive when Li entered the family? (Answer) Chen was still alive. They lived separately. (Judge asked) Where was Chen from? (Answer) She was from Xiangshan, Ningbo. (Judge asked) Who is currently in possession of the money? (Answer) The defendant Zhang Li. Then, the defendant Zhang Li testified that she was forty-three years old, from Suzhou, and resided at No. 8 Qing'anfang. (Judge asked) How much inheritance is there? (Answer) Over three thousand taels. However, my husband's coffin has not been buried. (Judge asked) What do you think about the plaintiff's request for a division? (Answer) It has already been divided. The gold jewelry was given to Zhao. (Judge asked) How many years have you been married to Zhang Meizhen? (Answer) I have been married for twenty-two years. Chen's daughter Lianzhu was only seven days old when Chen passed away, so I raised Lianzhu. My husband married me because Chen ate vegetarian food. (Judge asked) Did you have any children? (Answer) I did, but the boy did not survive. Only one daughter, who is twenty-two years old this year, has already married. (Judge asked) Did your husband adopt his nephew Xianxiang as an heir during his lifetime? (Answer) He did not adopt an heir. (Judge asked) Who held Meizhen's head after he died? (Answer) Lianzhu held his head, and Lianzhu also held the soul tablet. Now there is only this small amount of money, barely enough for daily expenses, and Lianzhu is still young. The husband's coffin has not been buried, and everything requires money, so there may not be enough. Then, the witness Zhang Xiangcheng testified that he was sixty-six years old and previously traded in Hong Kong. Xianxiang was indeed adopted as an heir at the age of nine. However, Meizhen did not adopt an heir at the time of his death. Then, the witness Zhang Xianding testified that he was thirty-one years old. Xianxiang is my younger brother. Last year, my uncle Meizhen was ill, and there were indeed over five thousand taels of silver and 173 pieces of goods stored in the Yongxing warehouse. I have been working in the company for many years. Then, Zhang Lianzhu testified that she was fourteen years old. After her father died, she held his head and mourned. (Judge asked) Did Xianxiang live in your house? (Answer) He came when he was little. He was driven out by my father in May of last year. (Judge asked) What business is he doing now? Do you know? (Answer) He works in a small cigarette paper store in Hongkou. He stopped doing business, so he came again on the fourth day of the first lunar month this year. The judge tried to mediate, ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff Zhang Zhao five hundred yuan and Zhang Xianxiang four hundred yuan, but all parties refused. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that there had previously been mediation outside the court by a person named Chuan, ordering the defendant to pay one thousand yuan. The defendant said that although there was such a proposal, only the interest was allowed to be taken, not the principal. The judge said that no matter what, Lianzhu is Zhang Meizhen's biological daughter and should receive her deceased father's inheritance. The judge ordered a further hearing to gather evidence and ordered the defendant to submit the account books of the Meitai Company for review before adjourning the court.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Paying Attention to Public Entertainment Safety</h3>
<p>Proposing Building Regulations for Cinemas and Amusement Parks. The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau has recently read reports of tragedies in Jilin and Japan caused by film screenings, resulting in numerous casualties. The Bureau notes the prevalence of cinemas and amusement parks in Shanghai and acknowledges the community's good fortune in having avoided similar incidents. However, it is imperative that public entertainment venues prioritize safety and take preventative measures to protect the public. The Jilin Yongji Theater disaster was caused by inadequate emergency exits. Shanghai's theaters and amusement parks appear to have adequate emergency exits, but it is unclear if these are sufficient to handle unexpected emergencies. Fire is a major threat in movie theaters, often caused by the flammability of film. Therefore, the Bureau recommends that film projection booths be strongly built, or that walls be lined with asbestos to contain flames, and that fire extinguishers be readily available. As this relates to construction engineering, the Bureau will write to the Public Works Bureau to request review and action.</p>
<h3>Child Abduction Solved Due to Suspicion of Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Su Zhisheng Cried Loudly</p>
<p>Shen Fugen et al. Have Been Detained</p>
<p>Su Xiaodi, 36, a Shanghai native residing at No. 1 Sujiagang, Fanhuangdu, Jisi Feier Road, West Shanghai, works as a gardener. He has a son named Zhisheng, 9, who attends Wujia Garden Elementary School nearby. On the afternoon of the 20th, at approximately 4:00 PM, Zhisheng was released from school and was a few steps away from the school gate when Shen Fugen and Lu Asan, tenants of the Su house (where Zhisheng does not live), stopped him and coaxed him, claiming that they would take him to Shanghai to see a play and had already discussed it with his father (Su Xiaodi). Zhisheng, being young, believed them and was lured to Shanghai, intending to be sold. As it was getting late, they took Zhisheng to Zhu Jinkun's house at No. 2363 Pule Lane, Yangshupu, for temporary lodging. Shen and Lu returned home. When the child's father, Su Xiaodi, saw that his son had not returned, he became extremely anxious and searched for him. He asked Shen and Lu, who both claimed to be unaware. After arriving at Zhu's house and being told to sleep, Zhisheng realized he had been deceived and started crying loudly, explaining that he had been tricked. Zhu tried to comfort him in vain. The neighbors heard him crying and suspected kidnapping. They secretly reported to the local Chinese police, who rushed to Zhu's house. Zhisheng was still crying. The police detained Zhu Jinkun and Zhisheng and took them to the Yangshupu Police Station. Zhu testified that Shen and Lu had sent the child and he did not know why. As the incident occurred in the Chinese territory, the police immediately sent them to the Public Security Bureau. The Bureau dispatched Detective Huang Shenqing to the 6th District Police Station in Caojiadu to report the situation. After receiving the report, District Chief Duan ordered detectives Liu Shaoqing and Zhong Juxian to go to Su Xiaodi's house at approximately 1:00 AM yesterday. They confirmed that the child was missing and arrested the tenants, Shen Fugen and Lu Asan, while they were asleep. They were taken back to the station. District Chief Duan questioned them separately. The defendant Shen, 30, from Tongzhou, residing at No. 14 Sujiagang, is a bricklayer. Lu, 20, from Haimen, residing at No. 53 Sujiagang, is a small business owner. Their statements were evasive. District Chief Duan, believing the abduction of a boy was not well-intentioned, immediately prepared a document and sent them to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>Unidentified Male Corpse Found on Beach</h3>
<p>At approximately 6:10 PM the day before yesterday, a patrol officer from the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau was patrolling outside the North Gate of Baoshan when he saw a male corpse lying on the beach in the Xiahesha area outside the seawall. The corpse appeared to be about 30 years old, with a shaved head, wearing a white short shirt and a flannel undershirt. The lower body was naked, with black gauze socks and black patent leather shoes. The clothing was neat and clean, resembling that of the upper class. There were no signs of water on the body, suggesting that he did not die from drowning. The officer returned to the bureau and reported the incident to the county government. At 9:00 AM yesterday, coroner Zhang Wei was dispatched to the scene to inspect the body and ordered the local officials to provide a coffin and burial. According to nearby farmers who reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau, at approximately 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, four individuals resembling students went towards the seawall, but only two of them returned. It was later reported that one person had died on the beach.

<h3>Shaanxi Wugong County Sends a Letter Reporting a Tragic Disaster</h3>
<p>Huayang Yizhen Association Continues to Allocate Relief Funds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Huayang Yizhen Association received a letter yesterday from Tian Bowen and others, representatives of the disaster victims in Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, which reads as follows: "Wugong is known to all, both at home and abroad, as the area in Shaanxi Province that has suffered the most severe disaster. Unexpectedly, the winter wheat crop last autumn was still not sown, leaving the people disheartened and the region increasingly impoverished. Deaths are increasing day by day. In addition, the heavy snowfall last winter lasted for months, compounding the disaster with severe cold. There is no food or clothing. People cry out in the frozen land. Even the desire to take tree bark and grass roots to fill the stomach, or to pick up fallen leaves and dry branches to ward off the cold, is unattainable. Therefore, the abandonment of male and female infants and entire families committing suicide are too numerous to count. Looking out over the plains, there is nothing but barren land. Within the villages, cooking smoke has ceased. Dilapidated walls and crumbling ruins fill the eyes with desolation. Along the Wei River, although there is a small harvest of autumn crops, it has repeatedly been ravaged by bandits, causing even greater suffering. Robbery, arson, and torture have left the affected areas in ruins. People are dead, and homes are empty, making the situation even more tragic. Alas, the people of Wugong are dying of hunger and cold. Those who do not die by suicide die from banditry. Those who survive are unable to live, and those who die are not buried. Truly, there are corpses lying along the road, and the starving fill the paths. Severed limbs and dismembered bodies are eaten by foxes and wolves. Alas, how can the misery of the people of Wugong be so heartrending and shocking? Businesses have closed down, and there is not a single one operating. Government agencies lack food and have been disbanded. It seems inevitable that the people of Wugong will perish together. Although the ice and snow have melted and spring plowing is imminent, there is land without people, and there are people without sustenance. There is no seed or labor, and the situation is precarious, making it impossible to survive the present day, let alone the long days to come. The famine has no end in sight. We earnestly request that you provide merciful sustenance and relief grain as soon as possible, and distribute seeds to help the people escape this vast disaster. The day the people of Wugong are reborn will be a year of gratitude." It is reported that the association has continued to allocate relief funds to the province. Unfortunately, the funds are limited and cannot alleviate the severe disaster. It is hoped that all sectors of society will assist in providing assistance.</p>
<h3>Pursuing Wife's Loss from Paramour</h3>
<p>Chen Zhirui, a man from Chongming around thirty years old, has made his living by rowing a boat. His boat is his home. His wife, named Genmei, was adopted by the Chen family as a baby. Chen felt that because his wife had grown up in his home since she was young, she was too familiar and oppressed by his family. In recent years, he has become very dissatisfied with her. He began an illicit affair with an old woman outside, and every night he would leave the boat to meet her in secret, neglecting his young wife. This caused his wife to have other ideas and become acquainted with Xue Zhigao, an old clerk at the Yida Ironworks. Their relationship became very close. Chen did not initially suspect anything. The night before last, Chen moored his boat at the Laozha Bridge on Suzhou Creek overnight. He left the boat again to meet his lover. Xue took the opportunity to sneak onto the boat late at night and spend the night with Chen's wife. Unexpectedly, their affair was discovered by Chen's mother and sister. When they tried to catch them in the act, Xue escaped to shore, abandoning a silk robe and cotton-padded coat. Chen's mother scolded her daughter-in-law, and they all went to sleep. However, Chen's wife suddenly disappeared in the early morning, her whereabouts unknown. When Chen returned in the morning, he learned the whole story. Suspecting that Xue was responsible for enticing his wife away, he caught Xue in the afternoon, dragged him to his boat, and demanded that he hand over his wife Genmei. Xue refused, and they argued with each other. They then reported the incident to the water police, who brought them both to the water police station. According to the plaintiff Chen Zhirui's statement, he only wanted the defendant to return his wife. If the defendant wanted to forcibly take his wife as his own, he would buy the defendant as his wife for 400 yuan.

Last year, when he returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, he brought over 200 yuan and a gold ring, which he gave to Chen's wife for safekeeping. He has since used them gradually, and there is still 60 yuan and a gold ring left. Suddenly, the day before yesterday, Chen completely confiscated them. His wife was so distraught that she tried to commit suicide several times. He learned of this and went to the boat last night to comfort her. He also stated that Chen had abducted his wife and ran away. The police chief, finding the statements of both parties contradictory, ordered Investigator Cheng Yongnian to escort the plaintiff and defendant to the District Court for investigation.</p>

<p>Zhang Gengchun, a native of Ningbo who worked as a laborer at the Yinxiang Far East Sports Field, was 28 years old.

However, opinions on the implementation of salary increases and treatment of apprentices remained deadlocked, requiring the labor side to concede again and again to the lowest possible terms, which ultimately proved ineffective. As the end of the year approached, they were forced to request the Social Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government for assistance in mediation. The request was approved, and the Jiagutang Rice Merchants Association was notified to send representatives, but the capitalists delayed and ignored the request, continuing to procrastinate and passing the lunar New Year. The labor side put forward preconditions. Now, the Social Affairs Bureau convened both labor and management parties according to law, and after more than two months and five mediations, Xu Jingzhi, the representative of the capitalists, proposed a review of what had been directly decided before, adding more constraints. Yesterday afternoon, the Social Affairs Bureau, as a last resort, prepared to submit the mediation to the Municipal Government for arbitration, but Xu Jingzhi, the representative of the capitalists, talked incessantly, leaving no room for others to interject, determined to achieve the goal of eliminating the labor union. He used irrelevant and nonsensical language to oppose the salary increase, repeatedly resorting to deception, denying the previous agreement, and demanding its revision, stating that the salary increase was out of the question. Xu Jingzhi's theory not only rejected the demand for a salary increase but also sought to overthrow the union. The case of the conditions is still awaiting mediation. They resolutely refuse to recognize Xu Jingzhi as the representative of the capitalists. Xu Jingzhi is a public enemy of the Shanghai rice industry workers. The suffering of the workers over the past six months has been ignored. The workers must seek a way out, unite further, and strive to achieve the goal of a salary increase, etc.</p>

<h3>Our Country's Overseas Baseball Stars Return Home</h3>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai on May 4th to Participate in the Far Eastern Games</p>
<p>According to the Japan Sports Association, because there are no baseball players in China for this year's Far Eastern Games, Honorary Chairman Wang Zhengting telegraphed the Honolulu Chinese Baseball Team, which is famous throughout the United States, asking them to return home to participate and help the war effort. However, eight of the star players could not return home due to circumstances, and only seven agreed to participate. Chairman Wang repeatedly telegraphed to comfort them, and all expenses were borne by Wang personally. The entire team was deeply moved and decided to go on an expedition together, vowing to win glory for the motherland. The country has a total of fifteen star players and one supervisor. Only two cannot return home, and the rest will depart from Honolulu on the Canadian steamer on April 24 and arrive in Shanghai on May 4. They plan to practice vigorously in Shanghai and then go to Tokyo to participate in the games. They are scheduled to return to Honolulu on June 21. With the team's arrival, our country has great hope for the baseball championship. (Tokyo Correspondence, March 17)</p>

<h3>Philippines Joins Women's Ball Games at the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>After Japan announced that women's basketball would use men's rules at the 9th Far Eastern Games, the Philippines expressed dissatisfaction. Because men and women are physiologically different, it would be too strenuous for women to play men's rules, which would hurt their bodies. Therefore, it was decided not to participate. As for women's volleyball and tennis, teams are planned to participate. As for the matter of women's basketball using men's rules, it is especially unfavorable for our country's women.

Less than a minute into the preliminary round, Soochow's five forwards dribbled the ball into Shanghai's inner defense zone. The Shanghai inner defense used their hand to touch the ball and was penalized with a twelve-yard kick. Luo Zhimei of Soochow University took the kick and scored immediately. Shortly after, Soochow's inner defense jumped up to kick the ball and kicked the shoulder of Shanghai's left forward. The referee also ruled a twelve-yard penalty. The ball was kicked powerfully into the net by Shanghai's left inner defense. Subsequently, the ball often revolved in the Shanghai area, and Zhu Chongen scored three goals in succession. At the end of the first half, Soochow won 4-1.</p>
<p>In the second half, after changing sides, Shanghai gained the advantage of the wind, and the momentum of the ball improved. They scored two goals one after another.

<p>Securing the Right to the Finals is Problematic</p>

<h3>Soochow University Football Championship</h3>
<p>Due to the Eligibility of Player Wang Shoufang</p>
<p>The Issue Has Not Yet Been Resolved</p>
<p>An Inquiry Has Been Sent to the National Games</p>
<p>The ball game championships of the people's preliminary games were mostly resolved the day before yesterday. Yesterday, Soochow University won the tennis championship. Only football and basketball still have problems. Originally, the Soochow University football and basketball teams had defeated all rivals and were invincible. Among their players, Wang Shoufang is studying at an important school, exempted from room and board fees, and serving as a middle school sports official. The four major university sports associations had allowed him to attend the competition. This time, it has caused protests from various parties. The Regulations Committee has inquired with the National Games about Wang's qualifications and asked for instructions on how to handle the situation. As of yesterday, they had not received a response. If Wang has no problems, yesterday's football championship will go to Soochow, and they will also get the right to the basketball finals. Otherwise, this year's football championship will be cancelled, and no further games will be played. Shanghai Middle School will then regain its right to the basketball finals. Therefore, Wang's fate depends entirely on a word from the National Games.</p>
<h3>No Football Team Will Be Sent</h3>
<p>The Selection Committee Decided Last Night</p>
<p>The Selection Committee decided last night that Jiangsu Province will not send a football team to the National Games. The championship will be decided after Wang Shoufang's eligibility is resolved.</p>
<p>At this Jiangsu Provincial Games, Suzhou Middle School continued to win the team and individual total scores. However, due to the issue of freshman Lu's eligibility to participate in the games, various schools launched attacks. The school's principal, Wang Diancun, in order to maintain order at the venue and promote the spirit of sports, specially declared to the organizing committee that since the association's charter does not stipulate how long a freshman must be in school before being able to participate in sports, Lu's eligibility is beyond doubt. The games cannot be stopped, and the prize can be given up. Therefore, when awarding the prize, Yang Xingfo publicly announced this intention and temporarily reserved the prize. Suzhou Middle School students obeyed orders, paraded around the venue, and cheered, and the order was very good. The next day, the school's entire team of athletes still arrived at the venue in formation and participated in the people's games, continuing to win in basketball. It is also heard that the school's sports are comprehensive, and the national martial arts performance also ranked first, winning a silver shield from the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office. Furthermore, its fifty athletes were calm, which shows a glimpse of the school's training.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Sends Off Huang Jianzhong</h3>
<p>Huang Jianzhong, Director of the Higher Education Department and Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education, was previously appointed by the National Government as a member of the Hubei Provincial Government and Director of the Education Department. He submitted two resignations, both of which were retained by the National Government. However, Chairman He of Hubei Province submitted a request that the Director of the Construction Department act as the Director of the Education Department before Huang's arrival, and at the same time, telegraphed Huang to take office. Recently, he received another telegram from He urging him to take office. Unable to refuse, he decided to go. All the staff of the Ministry of Education held a farewell party at the Ministry at 11:00 AM on the 20th and took a photo to commemorate the occasion. Huang stated that the National Education Conference is not far away, and he has already completed the draft of the higher education plan that he was responsible for. If he takes over the affairs of Hubei at this time, it will be good because Huang can still attend the National Education Conference as the Director of the Education Department, and he can explain the main points of the higher education plan at that time. It is rumored that Zhu Jingfei will succeed him in the vacant position of Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education, but today (the 20th), Zhu Jingnong told reporters that he has been the Director of the General Education Department for two years, and he has not yet done a good job in teacher education and vocational education. If he is promoted again, he will not be able to handle it. Considering his meaning, he has not heard of the Vice Minister position. However, newspapers have already reported the news of Zhu's succession as Vice Minister, which may not be groundless. Perhaps Minister Jiang mentioned it orally in the Executive Yuan, which is also unknown.</p>
<h3>Tuition Fee Uprising at Tianjin Beiyang University</h3>
<p>A tuition fee uprising has recently occurred at Tianjin Beiyang University because students have not paid their tuition fees. It is said that the cause of this matter has been brewing for a long time. Last year's strike and the incident of attacking the Director of General Affairs were all related to this. The reason held by the students is that all national universities in Peiping do not pay fees according to regulations, which is used as a pretext. President Mao Yisheng believes that Beiyang's academic style has always been simple and does not want to start this trend, which would affect other universities in Tianjin. Therefore, he insisted that fees must be paid according to regulations. After the start of school this spring, although President Mao repeatedly advised within two weeks, only a dozen people paid fees, and the rest turned a deaf ear. On March 1st, President Mao summoned all the students to give a speech, setting a deadline of three days. If they still do not pay according to the regulations by the deadline, it means they do not trust the school authorities, and he will resign to take the blame. On April 1st, there was still no movement, so Mao immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Education to resign and decided at the same day's administrative meeting that if students still do not pay fees by the 10th, classes will be suspended from that day because those who do not pay fees according to regulations will not be allowed to attend classes. If fees are not paid after two weeks, they will be expelled. If the whole body does not pay fees, the whole body will not be allowed to attend classes, which is no different from suspending classes. Unexpectedly, by the 10th, the students still did not pay fees, so President Mao left the university from that day. At the same time, faculty and staff also stated that students' failure to pay fees without reason is purely a matter of academic style and also resolutely suspended classes from that day. Seeing this situation, the students realized that refusing to pay fees would ultimately not be a stance. Therefore, they changed the issue to</p>
<p>raising objections, because when Mao came to Tianjin the year before last, he had been warmly welcomed by all the students, and he only took office then. In the past few days, Tianjin newspapers have recorded a lot about this matter, and the most noticeable are Hu Dunfu's published discussions and Mao Ju's notices in various newspapers.</p>
<p>Hu Dunfu said, "I have always liked to uphold justice, and now I happen to be at Beiyang again, and there are things I cannot help but say. Now, please allow me to first cite the facts: A. Regarding the so-called background: (1) Beiyang's academic style has always been known for its simplicity, and students mostly concentrate on their studies and do not ask about other things. (2) Beiyang professors advocate strict training and have no habit of perfunctoriness. (3) Beiyang's funds are not sufficient, and at the end of each semester, it relies entirely on the authorities to maintain it in a personal capacity, relying on the income from school and accommodation fees at the start of the semester to offset it. B. Regarding this tuition fee issue: (1) Students cannot comply with the regulations to pay fees, the authorities cannot maintain discipline, and there are also practical difficulties, so they are resolutely passive. (2) The authorities asked the faculty and staff to temporarily take over the school affairs. The faculty and staff, in order to maintain Beiyang's academic style, unanimously decided that they could not accept the university affairs, so there was a temporary invisible pause. (3) The faculty and staff held a meeting on the evening of the 9th, summoning representatives from each class to ask them to advise their classmates to quickly comply with the regulations and pay fees to avoid academic losses. (4) Some students worried about problems with the school's funding. The faculty and staff expressed that if students comply with the regulations to pay fees, the president would not be passive. Even if the source of funding is cut off, colleagues are still willing to do their best to maintain Beiyang's reputation. I dare to guarantee the above-mentioned items, and the last item, the attitude of the faculty and staff, was what I, on behalf of all the faculty and staff, personally announced to the representatives of each class at the meeting of the faculty and staff at 9:30 PM last night. From this, it can be seen that Beiyang's faculty and staff have the great ambition to sacrifice themselves to rectify the school affairs. If it is said that the suspension of classes was decided because of insufficient funding, it is said that the rumors are untrue, and it is inevitable that the vision is too small. It should be known that from the perspective of the faculty and staff, the school's greatest illness is not the lack of funding, but the lack of spirit. Now, in a school, students do not abide by the regulations, and the president cannot be responsible. If the faculty and staff encounter this abnormal thing and still remain indifferent and do not correct it, then the school may be about to collapse. What education is there to talk about? However, according to my observation, Beiyang's future is very hopeful. Knowing benevolence through fault, the reasons are as follows: (1) The students' failure to pay fees is actually a manifestation of the majority knowing that this matter is wrong but not daring to speak up and correct it. This is due to the past</p>
<p>[&gt; Soochow Women's Final Game of the Volleyball Championship for Women’s Teams in Suzhou; Zhang Yingfen, who scored the most points in Suzhou, is in the left corner &lt;]</p>
<p>The habit of studying without asking about things, so they dare not be brave when they see righteousness and temporarily lose their autonomy. (2) The president's failure to be responsible is actually a manifestation of not considering following the old ways perfunctorily and not wanting to take decisive measures. This is due to the misguided belief in the school's</p>
<p>trajectory. Therefore, these are all the faults of gentlemen and not absolutely without remedy. The faculty and staff are now taking it as their duty to urge the students and the authorities to reflect, on the one hand, to blame the president with righteousness, not to compete with the students for their departure, making the majority of the excellent ones lose their protection, and also stepping into injustice, and they should urgently return to school to take charge, so that the school can be maintained. On the other hand, to make the students understand that the school cannot be without discipline, if they do not comply with the regulations and pay fees, they should be removed from the rolls according to the regulations and not be allowed to attend classes. Those who are excellent and understand the principles should take the lead in actively upholding justice, and even those one or two who say they will not pay are definitely not people who will devour others. There is no need to be intimidated by the scene and not dare to advocate for something, sitting idly by and causing themselves and their peers to lose their studies. In addition, there is one more thing to say. Many of Beiyang's professors are well-known people in the country who came to admire Beiyang's academic style. Among them, there are even those who have stayed here for many years and are closely related to the school. Therefore, their views mostly lean towards rectifying discipline and maintaining academic style. Just as I came north last year to recuperate and also wanted to amuse myself by teaching at this noble institution. I am an extreme opponent of teachers and students striking, and I did not allow it at all when I previously organized Datong University. I also served at the National Women's University, and during the turbulent student movements and the cutting off of funding, classes were never suspended for a single day in three years. I was in a crucial position at that time, and there were many constraints, but I was still able to implement my views. How could the faculty and staff of Beiyang today, who have always had a unique spirit, not be able to uphold public opinion and maintain their beloved Beiyang University? March 11, 1920."</p>
<h3>Shanghai British School Should Be Changed to a Tutoring School</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Order from the Municipal Education Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to the privately run Shanghai English School yesterday, stating: "For compliance with the order, according to the inspection report, the school's organization is divided into English courses, regular courses, preparatory courses, complete primary schools, commercial English night schools, English typing special courses, etc., but the facilities are simple, there are four classrooms, the order is chaotic, and the light and air are not very suitable, etc. The school is called a special school, which is also inappropriate. It should be renamed as an English tutoring school, and the complete primary school and other levels should be discontinued by the end of this semester. Its classrooms and facilities should also be actively improved. Therefore, this order is for compliance and should be reported back for verification."</p>
<h3>The Coming and Going of Two Students Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>Wu Chuntong Goes to France. Wu Chuntong, a native of Yiwu, Zhejiang, graduated from the Department of Political Economy of Zhejiang Public Law School. He was highly valued by all teachers and friends in the school for his noble character and diligence in learning. After graduating, he worked in the Harbin Special Region Court and the Ministry of Justice and Administration of the National Government, where he achieved excellent results. He is scheduled to take a French mail ship to France today to study abroad. He plans to go to the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris to specialize in jurisprudence and social legislation. Recently, Wu's friends have been busy raising money for him. (Photos) (Top) Wu Chuntong (Bottom) Sun Pengxian</p>

In the sixteenth year, the school authorities prevented students from engaging in revolutionary work, so the whole body left the school, and then entered the Shanghai Law School. In the summer of the seventeenth year, he obtained a bachelor's degree and immediately went to France to study law and politics, obtaining a master's degree from the University of Paris and a doctorate from the University of Nancy. His graduation thesis was also praised by the French legal community. Later, he went to England, Belgium, and other countries to study the rule of law. In February, he set off from Berlin and returned to China via Siberia. He was detained by the Russians in Chita. After various explanations, he was able to escape danger and arrived in Shenyang on March 8th, and soon after, he transferred to Shanghai by boat.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Convenes the Board of Directors of the University</h3>

After the Municipal Education Bureau submitted a report to the Ministry of Education, it was ordered that the university's operations were not in line with those of primary and secondary schools and that it had no achievements. It was ordered to close, and the bureau immediately issued an order to comply with the closure, clean up finances, and issue certificates to students on file. On March 8th, the university's student union and the group of students who had withdrawn from school petitioned the government to expedite the completion of the closure, refund all fees, and issue transfer certificates. It was again ordered to comply and report back. Now, it is ordered by the ministry to rush to complete the closure and has specifically scheduled a meeting with the board of directors of the university at 9:30 AM on the 22nd of this month to discuss the aftermath.</p>

<h3>In Memory of Mr. Yang Shaohou</h3>
<p>— Chen Weiming</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Shaohou, named Zhaoxiong, was a native of Yongnian County, Zhili Province. He was the grandson of Yang Luchan, known as Yang the Invincible, and the son of Jianhou. He received the transmission of his grandfather and father, and also learned from his uncle Banhou. His art was very refined. At the age of nineteen, he competed with Wan Chun, a disciple of Banhou, and knocked Wan Chun against the door, shattering the door. From then on, he became famous. Mr. was arrogant by nature and liked to drink alcohol, which was even worse when drunk. Therefore, many people were wary of him. Mr. transmitted to Mr. Tian Shaozhi for his studies, etc. I studied with Mr. Chenfu, Mr.'s younger brother, and often asked Mr. for guidance. Mr. was also happy to talk to me. His words were all essential meanings of the fist, and I always recorded them. As Mr.'s age increased, his boxing became more compact. His attacks were very short, but his intent was far-reaching. His posture seemed to stop, but his spirit wanted to move. Suddenly happy, suddenly angry, like a cat catching a mouse, a falcon catching a rabbit. Whether they knew it or not, the spectators all laughed and applauded, saying, "This old man's spirit is sufficient and his qi is complete," and exclaimed that it was the peak of perfection. Last year, the Zhi Rou Boxing Association held a meeting. Mr. came to Shanghai to perform boxing. He was in high spirits and talked with me for two days and nights, never leaving boxing. Then he bid farewell and left. Alas, at this time of the rise of martial arts, it is the autumn of heroic triumph, but Mr. was heard to have committed suicide. Although his strong nature did not change until old age, he ended up in death due to the difficulty of a meal and having no other choice. How could one not wring one's wrists and sigh deeply for this? Mr. was seventy years old when he passed away.</p>
<h3>A Record of Visiting the Independent Salon</h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>The 41st Independent Salon was held from early January to the end of February in the old Royal Palace in Paris. I visited it twice, and I will now briefly record my thoughts after viewing it.</p>
<p>Since coming to Europe, I have visited the Independent Salon art exhibition twice. I feel that the association has a sense of quantity over quality. The total number of works on display each time is about 5,000 paintings, and there are also more sculptures than other exhibitions. All exhibited works are not reviewed, and the good and the bad are displayed together. This year, a total of more than 4,400 paintings and 462 sculptures and small handicrafts are displayed, divided into 45 rooms. Each room has sculptures in the center. The furnishings and lighting are very suitable, but when viewing each room, only two or three out of ten works are satisfactory. The rest are ordinary.</p>
<p>There are large and small art exhibitions in Paris almost every day of the year, except for the summer when there are fewer. The largest in scope are five: the Spring Salon, the Autumn Salon, the Winter Salon, the Independent Salon, and the Academy Salon. (Salon Tnlilerie). Among the five exhibitions, the Academy Salon has the most and most complete works by famous artists, followed by the Autumn Salon. The rest have extremely wide restrictions, especially the Independent Salon. Its purpose is to be open to the public. The purpose of establishing this association 40 years ago was to confront the painting style of the Academy. Because at that time, the Academy painting school adhered to tradition and was too biased towards form, the association wanted to allow young, unknown writers to develop their talents arbitrarily, and also to avoid discouraging authors who were temporarily unsuccessful in other art exhibitions. The original intention was excellent. We should look at today's Independent Salon with new eyes. The association has played a powerful role in the rise of French new art and its occupation of the center of the world's art. Modern Parisian new school giants have all been promoted by this association. The current president, Signao, is the founder of pointillist impressionist painting. His painting technique uses color dots arranged like woven fabric. Another co-founder of this painting school was Sellrat, who died early. Signao is now regarded as the representative figure. He has written a special book detailing the meaning of pointillism. For a time, many young people followed him, but I did not like his paintings because his views and techniques contained too much scientific analysis.</p>
<p>Currently, there are 80,000 artists from various countries living in Paris. Even laymen can distinguish the quality of their techniques. Those with special talents or who have pioneered new paths will never be buried. Those who have no content and make empty claims will never have a chance to succeed. As for submissions, they are extremely free. Anyone who voluntarily submits to any exhibition must pay a display fee of 70 francs per person. The work is limited to two pieces. The number of people who submit to the Independent Salon each time is often more than 3,000, making it the most profitable.</p>
<p>People from various countries who study art in Paris all submit to various exhibitions. Chinese people often do so as well. However, the weakness of our technique is undeniable. Every time I visit an art exhibition, I feel that the Europeans' rapid progress in contemporary art is like strange flowers blooming, and at the same time, I deeply feel that artists should work hard on themselves and not be deceived by false names.</p>
<h3>Promoting the National Product: Guanghua Matches</h3>
<p>— Tan Qiulang</p>
<p>Ever since Suirenshi taught the people the art of making fire, the system of cooking food was created. However, at that time, obtaining fire was not easy, whether it was obtained from sunlight or by drilling wood or metal to find fuel. Since the evolution of science and the invention of matches, the people have truly benefited from them. My friend, Mr. Mao, who works at the Guanghua Match Company in Hangzhou, came to Shanghai yesterday and talked about the general situation, which is quite worth mentioning. Therefore, I record it as follows.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Guanghua Match Company is grand in scale and produces a wide variety of products, making it worthy of being a leader among the provinces south of the Yangtze River. Last year, Kong Xiangxi, the Minister of Industry and Commerce, visited Hangzhou. Mayor Zhou Xiangxian led him to visit various departments of the company. He greatly praised its internal organization. According to the company, the average daily output is 150 boxes. Each box contains 7,200 small boxes of matches, for a total of 1,080,000 small boxes. The breadth of its business is something that other companies cannot hope to match.</p>
<p>Mr. Mao said that this small box of matches, though extremely small, cannot be made without going through 50 handovers. Now I know that material resources are difficult, and I believe it even more. He also said that the company's products are roughly divided into three types: red-head, black-head, and yellow-head. The black-head (i.e., ordinary) are supplied to the entire province of Zhejiang. They are also sold in other provinces such as Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, and Jiangxi. As for the red-head, they are popular with the people of Changshan and Yushan in Zhejiang. The yellow-head, red-stem type is only sold exclusively in Liyang, Jiangsu. And this type of material selection is also the most superior. However, except for the box shells, other pharmaceutical materials and wood stem materials must be supplied by imported goods. I asked why they did not use domestic goods to avoid the outflow of rights. He said that if domestic wood stems were used, there would be no such strong and sturdy material. The stem would break before the fire was struck. As for the pharmaceutical materials, there is no such huge amount of goods in the country, and they are also expensive. Therefore, they have no choice but to purchase foreign goods. Furthermore, the preparation of pharmaceutical materials for black-head matches is about seven kinds: white medicine, Guangdan, lead powder, phosphorus, saltpeter, antimony powder, and Yang. Only three kinds are needed for red-head matches: white medicine, saltpeter, and sulfurized phosphorus. In recent years, a certain country, seeing the profitability of the match business, has cleverly manufactured various brands and shipped them to China year after year. The outflow of money is incalculable. Thinking about it, I feel deeply indignant. Fortunately, the authorities in Zhejiang are promoting domestic goods and sparing no effort. On the one hand, they encourage the company to produce high-quality and fast products. On the other hand, they heavily tax imported goods. If they can further research domestic raw materials to make completely domestic goods, then it may not be a way to plug loopholes.</p>
<h3>A Visit to Huishan Park</h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>Huishan's park began in the autumn of the past year. I, being bound by worldly affairs, have not been there once. If the mountain spirit knew, it would laugh at me. Yesterday, my clan member, Mr. Shao Pan, came to Xishan and invited me to accompany him. We reached the foot of the mountain by car. Because the garden is secluded in a corner, it is like searching for Peach Blossom Spring and getting lost. After several inquiries, we arrived at the base. The garden was converted from the Li Gong Ancestral Hall. Seeing the solemnity and magnificence of the building, I can imagine the prosperity of Hefei's achievements in those years. Although private property has now been turned into public property, contemplating the past and present, I cannot help but feel emotional. The land is not very large, but it excels in elegance. It is called a park, but it is actually like a mountain villa. Entering the gate, after passing through the hall, the scenery gradually improves. On the side is a spring pool, surrounded by a long corridor and curved railings. There is a pavilion like wings. This is the couplet of Han Ya, which says, "Better than sitting in heaven, as if walking in the water." We sat down, sipped tea, and took a short rest. Soon it was noon, so we ordered the attendants to bring food. The water is green and the mountains are blue, and everything is good for drinking. At that time, there were few tourists and no noisy mountain birds. Sitting opposite an old friend, meeting in a foreign land, we had the elegance of kinsmen and no distinction between host and guest. During the banquet, we talked freely about the lakes and seas and lamented our homes. All the burdens and worries were relieved. After the meal, we climbed the mountain step by step and walked to the Ren Cao Nunnery. This Guanhua Pavilion was where Nalan Rongruo and Gu Liangfen went up the ladder to enjoy the moon in the early Qing Dynasty, thus becoming a historical site. Over time, it became desolate. In recent years, the local people raised funds to rebuild it. The three-story majestic pavilion is brand new. I heard that there are still portraits and poetic fans of Rongruo stored in it, but I did not see them. However, I have long admired him after reading "Drinking Words". The Tou Pavilion faces Huishan Park. Li Gong's ancestral hall was abandoned because it was a house of the Qing Dynasty. Rongruo was of Manchu descent. As a noble son, he became a lyricist. His remaining charm and legacy are still being carried on by the people of Xishan. Is it that they belittle the former and favor the latter? Because the importance of articles is greater than wealth, and only articles can endure the changes of time and have their own value for thousands of years. Therefore, the famous mountain career is something that cannot be done but can be done. The ancients were actually foolish and not foolish. So I record it together.</p>
<h3>Hu Puan's Poem</h3>
<p>— Zhizheng</p>
<p>Hu Puan, who was newly appointed by the National Government as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, previously served as the Dean of Studies at the Zhengfeng Literary Academy and the head of the Editing Department of the Two Roads. He has made great contributions to sorting out national studies. Before the director was announced, he once wrote a poem about moving, saying, "(I have been driven by hunger at sea for twenty years, and my snail dwelling has moved three times today. The car is only loaded with books, and there is no harm in the room being like a boat. The birds are startled by the cold and their nests are unstable, and the fire can be passed on by splitting the firewood. Who knows what a gorgeous hall or a humble room is like? It's all a dream of Nanke.)" The meaning between the lines shows a lot of disappointment. Who knew that as soon as the poem was finished, the appointment was issued. Now he is going to the province to take office. Looking back at this poem, how can he not laugh? It is also a good story. So I record it casually.</p>

<h3>News from the Beijing Opera Scene</h3>
<p>— Kan Yunlou</p>
<p>On the first evening of March, Yang Xiaolou performed "Iron Cage Mountain" at the Kaiming Theater, and Xin Yanqiu performed "Mandarin Duck Tomb." Despite the continuous spring rain, the theater was full. The next evening, Xiaolou, Yanqiu, and Ju Peng jointly performed "Picking the Tassel" and Xin also sang "Famen Temple" with Yang. Two heavy hits. The audience was even larger. On the same evening, Xue Yanqin originally posted the entire "Jade Hall" at the Zhonghe Theater. When the playbill came out, the play was temporarily changed. This kind of phenomenon is common in Beijing. It is intended to avoid the limelight and is not to be blamed.</p>
<p>On the 7th, Yanqiu went to Tianjin with his mother and brother to celebrate Li Zhisheng's upcoming 60th birthday and performed "Visiting Mother and Scolding the Palace." He was scheduled to return to Beijing on the 9th, because the playbill for the 10th evening at the Kaiming Theater had already been set as "Scolding the Palace," with Ju Peng as the supporting actor. Xiaolou was scheduled to perform "Falling Horse Lake."</p>
<p>The play "Overlord Meets Yu Ji" has been copied and distributed and will be performed at the Kaiming Theater soon. He has sung the play "Farewell My Concubine" with Xiaolou before, and the word-of-mouth has been excellent, not inferior to his teacher (referring to Mei Lanfang). Yu Ji has created a new situation, and it should cause a sensation in the nine cities.</p>
<p>Xiaolou greatly appreciates Yanqiu's artistic achievements. He also believes that the Kaiming's business is developing rapidly, and Yanqiu's contribution is significant. It is especially necessary to maintain contact. Xiaolou is good at young male roles and is willing to play Lü Bu to match Yanqiu's Diao Chan to express his goodwill. A few days ago, a certain female singer performed at the Chunhe Theater in Tianjin and asked Li Huating of the theater to invite Xiaolou to sing "Farewell My Concubine" to increase her reputation. Xiaolou politely declined. Huating repeatedly requested. Xiaolou said, "My Yu Ji in 'Farewell My Concubine' has Lanfang for male roles and Yanqiu for female roles. How can I easily perform with others? If there is an opportunity in the future, I will go to your theater with Boss Xin Yanqiu to sing once. I'm afraid others are not qualified." His words were crisp and calm, like playing Huang Tianba. Huating left disappointed, and it became a laughing stock for a while.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (153)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 9 The Celebrities Make a Fuss Playing Hide-and-Seek, a Beautiful Girl Willfully Protects Him</p>
<p>Everyone said the Seventh Young Master has arrived. Make way for him. Zheng Yanshou was truly surrounded by the flowers at that time. At that time, there were seven or eight horses on the racetrack, starting from one place, like releasing colorful fireworks. Zheng Yanshou couldn't see clearly for a moment. Two people in front stood up, blocking his view again. He said I can't see. I don't want to see it either. But that Bi Xiguan was very enthusiastic, saying, "Look, look. There's a cluster of seven or eight horses over there. Aren't they running over?" Zheng Yanshou said, "It's a pity I didn't bring a telescope. I have a very good German binocular telescope. They use it when they're marching. With this telescope, you can see even more clearly." Bi Xiguan said, "Seventh Young Master, can't you still see clearly? Stand up. I'll help you up. Stand on this chair and you'll be able to see clearly." Zheng Yanshou really stood up, putting his hand on Bi Xiguan's shoulder, and stood on the chair. But the railing on the balcony of the Mingjing Club was only half as high as a person. When people stand on the ground, the railing is about chest height. If you stand on a chair, it's a bit dangerous. But Bi Xiguan said to Zheng Yanshou, "Seventh Young Master, you can see clearly now, right? I'll protect you here." It turned out that Yanshou was standing on the chair, and Bi Xiguan was guarding him with both hands, as if he was hugging him. At this time, he was focused on protecting Zheng Yanshou, and he didn't have time to watch the race. But there were a lot of people crowded on the road opposite the Mingjing Club. Their eyes, besides watching the race, were also glancing in all directions. The most important thing was to see what beautiful women there were. Now, several people fixed their eyes on the upper floor of the Mingjing Club and saw a tall, handsome young man. It was a beautiful girl who had picked him up and was talking and laughing there. They thought it was a strange thing. First, two people shouted a word of praise towards the balcony of the Mingjing Club. In that kind of crowded place, as long as one person shows something special and pays attention to one place, many people will follow the gaze you are focusing on. Therefore, the people on the road all turned their heads and looked at the balcony of the Mingjing Club, and shouts of praise rose all at once, scaring Zheng Yanshou and making him want to jump down from the chair. But many people were crowded together, and he couldn't jump down for a moment, for fear of stepping on people's feet. But Bi Xiguan remained calm and unhurried, wondering what these idle people on the road were making a fuss about. So he said, "Seventh Young Master, slowly, be careful." He actually reached out and hugged him unceremoniously, pulling Zheng Yanshou down. Many people on the road applauded and cheered. They didn't pay attention to him. It was exactly</p>

<h3>Financial Standard Gold Plunges Sharply</h3>
<p>Large Silver Bars Surge, Foreign Exchange Soars</p>
<p>Gold Price Falls to 3.6 Liang</p>
<p>Lowest Reached 92 Liang, Yesterday, the 21st, the standard gold price plunged sharply due to the surge in large silver bars and a two-point increase in foreign exchange. However, there were no special changes. The front market only saw three liang fluctuate, and Hengxing sold quite a bit, while Wanxing and Shunli bought in. The opening price fell miserably by five to six liang, with a rough price as low as 92 liang. Afterwards, the exchange rate was still stable and rose by more than three liang. Later, it weakened slightly by more than one liang. The market became more peaceful, and buying power was more active. However, Hengxing continued to sell off, and the price rose by more than one liang. The morning opening price fell miserably by five to six liang. British silver bars increased by 5/8, and the silver price also increased by 5/8. The exchange rate fell by 1/16, and the May standard gold opened lower, decreasing by 5.8 liang, to 493.5 liang.

The Japanese Kim Wah Bank bought one liang at 2.9375 points. Subsequently, buyers mobilized, and when the first order was announced, it was 94.2 liang. The listed price had increased by half a point, the US dollar increased by one yuan, and the Japanese gold decreased by a small 2.375 points. However, the gold price did not fall again, with the actual value being 3.89 liang, because the internal situation was still stable and the Dalian gang had a strong buying mood. The Ji Hua Bank bought</p>
<p>5.625, and then added one liang. At 10 o'clock it was 95.6 liang. At this time, the Guangdong gang began to sell off, and the six-month British gold bank traded at 11.625 pence, immediately retreating more than two liang. At 10:30 it was 93.12 liang, and soon added 1.56 liang. At 11 o'clock it was 4.67 liang, and at 11:30 it returned to 3.5 liang. This was because people's hearts were unstable, and the surface showed sudden advances and retreats. By noon, the closing price was 94.1 liang, because Yu Da, Zhifeng, Yong and others were chasing in, and the foreign exchange was flat. The six-month Japanese gold bank's purchase price was 1.0325 liang, and the British gold was 11.625 pence. The listed price had been changed to 506.4 liang, because the Japanese gold had decreased by a small 2.275 points, initially suppressed by 12 liang in the morning, then 11 liang to 13 liang, and 12 liang at noon.</p>
<p>The afternoon market was mediocre with no major rises or falls. The afternoon opening price was 94.1 liang, and buyers raised it to 95.23 liang.

Then, Zhejiang absorbed one liang of the next month's Japanese gold at 1.03875, and Holland and Shanghai traded six-month British gold at 11.625 pence. At 3 o'clock it was 95.1 liang, and soon retreated by seven or eight qian. Because of the active buying, it returned to a high of six or seven qian. From 3:30 to 4:00 there was a fluctuation of two or three qian. The market was quite mediocre. Finally, because the Japanese Commercial Bank purchased and the silver bars on the surface were dry, it immediately raised by two liang. At 4:30 the closing price was 495.7 liang, a decrease of 3.6 liang compared to the previous day. The maximum price during the day was 95.7 liang, and the minimum price was 92 liang, a difference of 3.7 liang.

<p>The Dalian gang sold more than they bought. Hengxing, Fuxing Yong, Dadecheng, Bingxing, and Yuan Maoyong all sold. Wanxing, Shunli, Zhifeng Yong, Yiyu, and Yu Fayong all bought in. Xieyu, Kunhe, Yuantai, Yichang, and Taixing traded back and forth. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Shunli, Wanxing, and retail investors mostly sold. Zhifeng Yong, Yuan Maoyong, Senchang Yong, Yu Fayong, Jin Da Yong, and Yu Da all bought in. The Dalian gang bought more than 3,000 silver bars in the front market, sold 500 to 600 bars, and bought in mostly head-covering silver bars, so they sold foreign exchange.</p>

<p>Long Positions for This Month Have Gradually Been Sold Off</p>
<p>Overseas cotton markets are very firm. Due to the poor local situation and the thick bottom holdings, sellers are exerting strong pressure. Most retail investors are shorting, so the market is quite sluggish. Fortunately, actual sales are still decent, and buyers from Qingdao, Tianjin, and other regions are actively purchasing. There are no major changes in the yarn market at present, but the long positions for this month have been sold off by 300 bales per transaction. If there is no intention to take delivery, this price can still be maintained.</p>
<p>The Trend of Marked Yarn is Even. The pre-market opening of marked yarn was strong due to the rebound in American cotton. However, the long positions that had been absent for a long time this month suddenly sold to close out, and the market atmosphere suddenly relaxed, falling by one or two qian. The upward trend in distant months also disappeared. As a result, nearby months fell by one or two qian, while distant months rose by two to four qian. In the afternoon, distant months of marked yarn remained firm due to a lack of sellers, while the current month fell by another qian. The total trading volume for the day was 12,650 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Variety　Closing Price　Change　Inventory　Closing Price　Change　Inventory</p>
<p>March　1538 Down 3　25,900　June 1527 Up 6　24,500</p>
<p>April　1534 Up 1　42,100　July 1527 Up 4　21,400</p>
<p>May　1530 Up 8　33,100　August 1528 Up 4　19,750</p>
<p>Sichuan Dealers Still Actively Purchase Spot Goods, and Spot Yarn Sales Remain Good. According to statistics, dealers from various regions purchased a total of 1,885 bales throughout the day, with 200 bales traded among fellow merchants.</p>
<p>The buying from Sichuan dealers was the strongest, accounting for 485 bales. In addition, Niuzhuang purchased 385 bales, Shantou 110 bales, Ningbo 40 bales, Qingdao 315 bales, Tianjin 230 bales, Mainland 55 bales, Xiamen 100 bales, miscellaneous dealers 155 bales, and factories opened 200-300 bales.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Gradually Enters a Bright Stage</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very firm and the upward trend is quite strong, mainly because the situation of American cotton is firm, so retail investors have started to cover their short positions, and the market trend has become tight. However, Han dealers are taking the opportunity to sell due to the price increase. The sales of spot cotton in the market are still sluggish, and various factories still have not started in large quantities. The future of the cotton market depends entirely on the advance and retreat of foreign cotton.</p>
<p>The Buying Interest in Han Marked Cotton is Tense. The pre-market opening of Han Marked Cotton saw tense buying interest in the market due to the rise in American cotton, with each month rising by five fen or two qian. In the afternoon, the market trend continued to rise, and the upward trend in two or three rounds became more intense. The closing price retreated by one qian five fen due to Han dealers selling off. As a result, each month rose by one qian to five fen. The total trading volume for the day was 36,000 dan. The closing prices of Han Marked Cotton are recorded below:</p>
<p>Han Marked Cotton　Closing Price Change　Inventory　Closing Price Change　Inventory</p>
<p>March　3550 Up 15　50,600　June 3475 Up 30　75,200</p>

<h3>American Cotton Weakens and Recovers</h3>

<p>Spot prices rose by 5 points. English cotton futures fell by 5 points, and spot prices fell by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 20 points. The Indian cotton market was stable.

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than ten boats arrived at Zhabei from various routes. The market appetite focused on high-quality goods. Top-grade japonica rice rose by one jiao, opening at 20 yuan and one jiao. However, this type of rice was of excellent quality, and there were very few such goods on the market. Medium-grade and North japonica rice both rose by half a chi, and the situation showed no signs of falling. The sales of thin indica rice were fair. Sheep indica, Du indica, and Port indica rice were as rare as stars at dawn. Even in the inland areas, the supply was extremely scarce. Therefore, although sales to Shanghai were smooth, there were actually no goods available for delivery. Large traders were only short-selling. There were slightly more inquiries about Bianyin Yuan, and the prices rose sharply by two to three jiao, with an unusually active trend.</p>
<p>Boats arriving from the Shanghai South River were slightly more frequent, but sales were not smooth. High-grade japonica rice from Changshu, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Tongxiang was quoted at high prices, and the buying interest was excellent. However, the eagerness to buy was not as strong as the previous day. Southern dealers still purchased thin indica and early rice, and Ningbo dealers were also purchasing. Market prices were gradually increasing. Sheep, Du, and sharp indica rice were slightly stable due to the small amount of foreign rice. According to yesterday's market, both foreign rice futures and spot prices were soft. However, foreign firms were quite active in buying back, so the actual prices quoted on the market were all for goods being bought back, resulting in poor prices. Although local indica rice was affected, it was not easy to reduce prices. White Yuan was rare and sales were strong. In addition, the Zhabei market was tight, and people were bullish on prices. Large traders saw an increase of around two jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Spot Prices are High, Futures are Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice continued to rise, but interest from mainland dealers was slightly weaker. Each type of rice only rose by a few fen. However, there were many reports of famine in various regions, and the market remained optimistic. Yesterday, the Tong Market opened with two boats of Saigon rice (500 bags), priced at 14 yuan 6 jiao and a half; Small Jiaomi rice (2,000 bags), priced at 14 yuan 4 jiao and 7 fen; Large Jiaomi rice (2,000 bags), priced at 13 yuan 7 jiao and 8 jiao; Qiaofo rice (400 bags), priced at 13 yuan 8 jiao; and Su rice from the Mainland (700 bags), priced at 15 yuan 2 jiao. Futures trading involved more than 8,000 tons, and the market stabilized because some foreign firms sold off, and the market sentiment was not as serious as it had been in previous days.</p>
<h3>Flour Market is Driven Up by Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, sudden fluctuations were seen in various months. The main reason for this was that manufacturers had limited spot goods available for the near-term months such as March, April, and May, and actual sales were still ongoing. Foreign wheat prices were quoted higher, rising by three to four jiao. The more important factor was the standard wheat, as deliveries were approaching, and there were not many qualified goods available, leading to a tendency for short squeezes. As the wheat market improved, flour prices had to be driven up. Therefore, although the overall trading volume was not smooth, the market continued to open higher. Distant-month new flour also saw good interest from outside investors, and mainland customers absorbed quite a bit of supply, also showing signs of a rally. As a result, the current month was up one fen and two and a half li compared to the previous day, April and May were each up two fen, June was up one fen, July was up five li, and August was up two and a half li.</p>
<h3>The Appearance of a Wheat Market Short Squeeze is Becoming More Obvious</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, all months uniformly turned upward. The current month saw strong short covering as deliveries were approaching. It was rumored that most of the long positions for the current month needed to take delivery, while most of the short positions were substandard and could not be resolved, leading to mutual squeezing and a tendency for a short squeeze. At its highest point, it reached 5 liang, 2 qian, and 6 fen, later retreating slightly by 2 fen. April and June also saw a strong rally for this reason. Distant months remained stable. Observing later developments, if the long positions do not sell off, the current month may need to be squeezed higher. As a result, the current month rose by 4 fen compared to the previous day, April and June each rose by 3 fen, and July and August each improved by 1 fen. Spot wheat showed a slight improvement, but the goods being delivered were all medium to substandard, and there were not many good goods. Bengbu wheat was opened at 5 liang and 5 fen, Jiangxi wheat at 5 liang and 2 fen, 4 liang and 9 qian, 4 liang and 6 qian, Hunan wheat at 4 liang 7 qian and 2 fen, and 4 liang 6 qian and 6 fen, for a total of 2,000 bags, which were handled by Fufeng and Shenda.</p>
<h3>Soybeans are Gradually Firming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was tight. There were some shipments from the north, but they were mostly for resolving short positions. Shipments from the Yangtze River were minimal, and only the Shanghai inventory was still available. Small mill dealers and carriage workshops in the local market continued to inquire, and mainland dealers also felt more refreshed. Spot goods for Lian Yuan opened high at 5 liang, 4 qian, 6 or 7 fen. Standard near-term opened at 5 liang, 4 qian, and 3 or 9 fen, improving by 2 or 3 fen. Distant months also rallied due to the accumulation of goods by local merchants. As for Han Zha, Jiudong, and other beans, trading was limited throughout the day, and the overall market was similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods and Printed Cloth Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>The market situation for cotton cloth from local factories has become weaker day by day. This is mainly due to the excessive rumors about the current situation, and customer sales are on hold, resulting in a lack of excitement. Coarse twill and</p>
<p>coarse cloth are gradually falling. Yesterday, 9-pound cloth fell by another two and a half fen. Ten-pound cloth was able to hold steady due to limited inventory. Thirteen-pound goods fell by two and a half to five fen. Coarse twill was even more sluggish, with Maoying falling below the 5 liang mark. However, fine cloth and fine twill remained stable. Local merchants purchased more than 150 pieces of Laba brand fine cloth yesterday, priced at 6 liang, 7 qian, and 7 and a half fen. Caiqiu was slightly sluggish from Northern dealers. Prices were slightly soft. Yanghe fine twill saw active sales from mainland dealers, and spot goods were very scarce.</p>
<p>Large dealers in Eastern and Western piece goods have mostly stopped. The market is uniformly dispirited, as the looming clouds of war have caused fears that prices will fall, and they have temporarily adopted a hold-off strategy. However, sales in the local market are still not quiet due to the warming weather and the arrival of spring goods. Printed linen yarn from the East was traded for more than 100 pieces yesterday. Shoulao Qilu opened at 2 qian and 2 and a half fen, and E Tong Yu opened at 2 qian and 1 and a half fen. Newly arrived printed foreign yarn has not yet been sold. The decline in printed cloth is becoming more severe, and yesterday it entered the 4 liang range. Dealers from Xiamen and Fuzhou slightly increased their purchases of Western woven flower foreign yarn yesterday. Deji Dafa Cai was priced at 3 qian and 7 and a half fen, and Hongji Huanhuaxi at 3 qian and 7 fen. The local market saw more activity in Xi Fa Muslin cloth.</p>
<h3>Silk Flowers - Chinese and Japanese Silk Prices Move in Opposite Directions</h3>
<p>Since the lifting of the gold embargo in Yokohama, Japanese silk prices have soared. Sanguan dealers have mostly stopped buying Japanese silk due to the higher pulling prices. Silk prices have fallen sharply. Although the Japanese government has allocated funds to protect silk prices this time, the Japanese silk market has suddenly become more aggressive. However, as gold prices continue to rise, European sales of Japanese silk are still sluggish. Previously, American merchants had begun to accumulate goods due to the favorable pulling prices, and coupled with the weak report from the New York Shanghai factories yesterday morning, the shortage of goods has made prices more profitable. Yesterday, Qianli and others brought 80 bales of Shanghai white factory warp, and Gong An brought 10 bales of white dried warp, all with firm price increases.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods - Local Black Fungus Sales are Active</h3>
<p>Few Arrivals｀｀｀Customer Demand Rises</p>
<p>Arrivals of black fungus have been scarce recently, and opening prices have increased. Spot merchants are opening prices for assorted fungus at 122 liang to 116 liang and a half. Yesterday, dealers from Shantou, Taiwan, Guangdong and other places purchased more than 300 pieces, priced from 126 liang to 108 liang. It is found that the stock on the market has become thin, and the trend is quite firm. Han merchants purchase prices are 114 liang to 111 liang. The price of secondary grade fungus here is 178 liang, the price of the local brand fungus is 120 liang, and the price of assorted fungus is 115 liang to 108 liang.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Continue to Fall by Five Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw reports from the production area: the current price of Cuban raw sugar was still 2.00, and the New York futures price for March was 1.68, for May 1.67, each down by four fen; September was 1.76, also down one fen; and December was 1.84, with no increase in prices. The current price of Java sugar and the futures price for April were both 1.0375, and May was 1.0625, with no increase or decrease. The Public Association's market was quiet and deserted. The price of Dutch sugar, grade 24 raw sugar, continued to decline, and the buying interest was quiet. Although there were a few transactions, the price was 7 liang and 1 qian and a half, which was a further decrease of five fen compared to the previous day. Shipments were quite active, and the market was very weak. The price of fine ground white sugar was 7 liang and 2 qian, and the market also lacked vigor. The price of grade 20 medium white sugar was 7 liang and 5 fen, which was slightly more stable. Transactions for Japanese sugar were also sluggish. N grade was 7 liang and 8 qian, with slight transactions. Y.T. grade was 7 liang and 6 qian and a half, and Y.P. grade was 7 liang and 8 qian, with even fewer people accepting.</p>

<h3>Letter from Zhongda Alumni Lü Sibai and Wang Lin Yi from France to Mr. Beihong</h3>
<p>Mr. Beihong,</p>
<p>With respect and sincerity, we are writing this letter. We previously sent a letter from Paris, which we trust you have received. We took advantage of the Christmas holiday to make a long-awaited trip to Paris, spending nine days there. We were able to see most of the museums in a general sense. Due to the limited time, we were unable to visit all of the famous architectural landmarks. The Louvre's contents were vast, and we spent three days there, only able to see things superficially. Being in the midst of it felt like being swept into a giant wave, and we could not control ourselves. It was our first time seeing Ingres's original painting (The Source), and the splendor of the colors and lines truly quenched our long-standing thirst for admiration. Next, we visited the rooms of the Italian school painters. The first time we saw them, they left a deep impression on us. Raphael deserved to be called the Painting Sage, and Sibai especially loved Titian's (Entombment), whose colors, expressions, and structure were all eye-opening. There was also a half-length portrait in another room, which was also a masterpiece. As for the world-famous Vinci, his smile and Jesus as a child, St. Anne, and other works, the background was dark, and the color of the human body was clearly different. We admired and lingered, but we could not find the secret of its location. This may be because our judgment is not accurate. Following this room, there were works by Dutch and Spanish masters, among which Rembrandt and Velázquez were the best. The former wrote about the mystery of the world, and the latter expressed his outstanding ability. They each had their own immortal points. The Reuben room was magnificent and dazzling, but we wonder if all of them were painted by the artist himself, and why were there so many? Among the other painting rooms, the most breathtaking were those of Delacroix and Chen Siliguo, whose emotions were so passionate that they were convincing. The former's colors were quite Oriental, and we guessed that he must have traveled to Turkey and other places. However, Bopulu Dongneng was able to establish his own style, and was able to capture life from ancient sculptures and human bodies. His use of color was also unattainable. Walking on tiptoe and using color was beautiful, but it was a pity that it was transparent and not solid. Ge Shi and Fan Duo both had a small family style. If Davi were to use brushstrokes and colors, they could all be used as models. As far as we can remember, there were also Gu Erbei (landscape), Li Gan (portrait), and Xia Siliuefang Danglaiduer, who were also great masters. Alas, it is truly a great view of the world. Tracing the history of painting back to the 18th and early 19th centuries was the peak of talent, and we believe it even more after seeing this. When we entered the modern painting room, the realm changed, and we began to feel in contact with nature. Millet, Rousseau, Texia Xishi Lei, and others had their own infinite flavors, among which Millet's simplicity and Monet's naturalness were especially admirable. There are many other things we love, which cannot be fully described at once. In the future, if we have more time to explore its origins and understand its transformation, the interest will be even stronger.</p>
<p>After visiting the Louvre this time, we got the impression that our countrymen accounted for a small part of those who were copying paintings there. Liu Haisu was copying Millet's The Gleaners, changing the warm colors to cool colors. Wang Yachen and his wife were diligent from morning to night, and there were no other good ones. When we asked Liu Haisu and his colleagues if they planned to bring the copied paintings back to the country to promote them, we were deeply afraid that they would deceive themselves and others, and lose the original appearance of the originals. We must pay attention to this.</p>
<p>In addition to the Louvre, visiting the Luxembourg Palace was like eating a snack after a regular meal, and it often had a special flavor. However, famous works from the past have either been moved to the Louvre or elsewhere. The remaining ones were those of Beneir (Woman Facing the Fire) and Dayang's (Forest Music). The sculpture department was also quite worth seeing, including the works of the sculptor Budell, who passed away last year. Others, such as Pompos, who made birds and beasts, were able to capture their spirit and were also very interesting.</p>
<p>The Xiao Gong Art Museum has many modern Parisian painters, such as Roland, and we know the rest of the paintings, but we can't remember their names. The sculptures are also worth seeing. The marble sculptures of the three nude symbols of the Middle Ages and modern times are here.</p>
<p>In addition to these three art museums, the two places that have been of considerable benefit to us are the Luodang Museum and the Ainer Museum, because we were able to see the methods they used in their daily work and the materials they used. Heuner only used three colors to paint, which can be arranged and removed to form Prussian, and he made several small drafts before making a large one, so we have recently realized that Compostion is also important. If the composition is not good, we will not be able to fully express our thoughts. We have tried it once or twice, and although we have not achieved anything, we must work hard to do so.</p>
<p>During this trip to Paris, we became acquainted with more than a dozen Chinese art students, many of whom were like-minded. We observed their words and deeds, and we did not directly say what Mr. Liu did in Paris, but he was engaged in self-interest, just like in the past. In the summer, he went to the French border, falsely claiming to be going to Switzerland, but secretly bought other people's articles and published them in Shanghai newspapers to make a profit. He wantonly attacked and slandered, with no credibility. We have recorded these boring news for the time being. There are more and more Chinese students studying art in Paris, but most of them are in a bad situation or unable to enter schools to study, and none of them are outstanding. Moreover, the Paris School of Fine Arts is purely automatic, and the teachers come to the school very little time, and there are many students in the classroom. We feel that this scattering is both good and bad compared to Lyon. We don't know what our teacher thinks. Song Junzhong plays with plaster every day at the Louvre and works very hard. He has applied for the plaster class at the Art Academy. He is now very interested in drawing. We have met with Mr. Situ Qiao once, and he said that he was not very happy because of his economic difficulties, and he has decided to go to the United States to work at the end of this month. We are working as usual in Lyon, and we don't see any progress. We are sending three photos of our practice and ask for your correction. In the afternoon, we practice composition, and we have neglected French for several months because we don't have time. What should we do? Also, Mr. Hua Lin is scheduled to return to China around the summer vacation and intends to promote literary and artistic work, which will help to promote art a lot. How is our teacher recently? We have received the postcard. Thank you. We respectfully wish you good health.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Wang Linyi and Lü Sibai</p>
<p>The two gentlemen have made great progress. They made a hurried trip to Paris, and there were many omissions,</p>
<p>not many, but they had insights. The old classmates in the school should be happy to hear about their recent situation. I will publish it here. Beihong wrote.</p>
<h3>Obstacles to the Progress of the Fudan Law Department</h3>
<p>— Jing Zhi</p>
<p>Fudan's achievements in running the school can be regarded as outstanding among domestic universities. It has a long history and considerable honor. When it comes to domestic universities that can satisfy the Chinese people today, we can often hear the saying (Fudan in the South, Nankai in the North), which shows its position in society. Last spring, it was approved by the Ministry of Education and registered. Subsequently, it reorganized according to the University Regulations, establishing seventeen departments in total, combining them into four faculties: Arts, Science, Commerce, and Law. Unfortunately, when the Ministry of Education reported the filing, the Ministry of Education expressed its opposition to the establishment of the Law Department alone. The reason is that the Fudan Law Department does not have 100,000 yuan for start-up costs and 80,000 yuan for operating expenses. To be honest, Fudan naturally does not have that much funding, and indeed there are very few domestic universities that have this much funding to establish a law department. Because there are few schools that establish law departments, there will inevitably be fewer talents studying law in the future. Now that political tutelage has just begun, and all industries are waiting to be developed, there is a great need for talents studying law. How can we allow it not to increase but instead decrease? Moreover, the curriculum set up by the Fudan Law Department is based on the Soochow Law School and the Central Law Department. The required courses account for almost two-thirds of the entire curriculum, which is even stricter than the regulations promulgated by the Judicial Yuan. The Central Law Department stipulates that students graduate in four years, while Fudan stipulates that students who apply for the first year of the Law Department must have the level of a first-year student at a regular university, which is actually equivalent to graduating in five years. The purpose is to attach importance to the Law Department as a special department and to try to improve the level of law students in our country. The intention cannot be said to be not hard. Now the Fudan authorities and students are actively preparing to negotiate with the Ministry of Education in order to achieve a satisfactory outcome. It is deeply hoped that the Ministry can also give it considerable understanding.</p>

<p>Women's Life</p>
<h3>A Virgin's Heart</h3>
<p>(All women are strange, especially girls.)</p>
<p>Rémy de Gourmont wrote these two sentences in his novella "A Virgin's Heart."</p>
<p>Gourmont was a great French writer of the 20th century (1858-1915), a writer who excelled at "poetic prose." His famous works that have been translated into Chinese include Zheng Boqi's "One Night in Luxembourg," Zeng Xubai's "The Passion of Color," and Yao Pengzi's translation of "A Virgin's Heart."</p>
<p>Gourmont is a very likable writer. His works are mostly light and skillful. In the preface to "The Passion of Color," he expresses his creative opinions, saying, "A novel is really a poem. The rhythm of poetry must be put into prose. When writing it, the author must have a kind of happy illusion. No matter how fleeting it is, a happy afternoon is enough... Just in a few hours one night, these flowing springs of words overflow onto a scattered piece of blank paper."</p>
<p>Now let us open this novel written by the poet with his rich emotions and observe his psychological depiction of "a virgin's heart."</p>
<p>She was twenty years old, usually a happy and gentle girl, but she could pretend to be indifferent, ignore you, and despise you, with the most cruel expression. Her parents loved her but were also afraid of her, so they fostered her willful temperament.</p>
<p>Her name was Ruth.</p>
<p>There was a museum clerk named Hans Vande, who was nearly forty years old, and a good friend of Ruth's father. Every two or three years, he would stay at Ruth's house for a while. Hans Vande had three ways of addressing Ruth: in conversation, he used "you"; in front of guests, he used "Miss"; and in his heart, he used "Ruth."</p>
<p>The two often strolled in the woods, and naturally there were opportunities for intimacy.</p>
<p>He brought his face close to hers until it touched the edge of her large straw hat. How skillfully women handle such things! The hat disappeared, as if angrily discarded, and at the same time, a very pale and delicate forehead fell onto Hans Vande's shoulder.</p>
<p>She felt herself filled with a kind of joyful warmth. "I no longer belong to myself. This is really stimulating. What is about to happen? He will definitely kiss my eyes. I will not resist."</p>
<p>A kiss lightly fell on her soft eyelids. "He did everything I wanted him to do. Does he understand my thoughts, or do I understand his?"</p>
<p>Women are complex, of course, not necessarily more complex than men, but they are different, misunderstood by men. They do not understand themselves, and they do not want to understand. They trust their feelings, which is safe enough to control their lives and solve various problems that men cannot solve. To deal with them, one should treat them as they treat themselves, only through emotions can one come into contact with them. There is only one way to understand: to love them.</p>
<p>Although Hans Vande thought to himself, "She never loved me, and I never loved her. Kissing her eyes and forehead is another matter, it is fatherly affection," on the surface he still regarded her as a girl. But he loved her the instinctive impulse of men was silently teasing her. Hans Vande thought he was too good at understanding female psychology. He did not expect that young girls would also take the initiative. He seemed to be a careless hunter, forgetting that he had already fired his gun, and waking up to see a partridge already in his hunting bag.</p>
<p>As for Ruth, she happily reached the peak of her wishes. She was loved, which was happiness. She did not think about asking herself whether she was already in love. She did not ask about the state of her own heart.</p>
<p>Women completely trust the present, while men pay more attention to the future. Perhaps this is a sign that the nature of men is not as well organized as that of women.</p>
<p>He thought, she is indeed lovely. On her part, she also thought he was an admirable man. She thought,</p>
<p>"I belong to him. I have given him my lips. I am his."</p>
<p>After they exchanged passionate kisses, she smiled comfortably. She was happy. Just one kiss, and she contentedly said to herself, "Ah, now I am married."</p>
<p>Ruth was a young girl, with only some vague premonitions about the true meaning of this, and did not know how to promote her happiness.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a young architect named Leno came. He was good at talking, especially about love. Ruth found his words very interesting.</p>
<p>Ruth found this young man interesting. What a wonderful theory of love flowed from his mouth! So love is a sport. (Because Leno once said that love is the best sport there is. No game is better at keeping women's hands and feet soft, like tennis, cycling, or riding.) What a revelation! As her gaze followed the receding figure of this intelligent and courageous youth, the strangest fantasies were born in her heart. She wondered,</p>
<p>"I wonder how people enjoy love, true love. Hans Vande never taught me anything. He knows everything about love, probably more than this young Leno, but he keeps it to himself. When mocking my innocence, he treats me like a little girl. This is a gentle mockery, because he loves me, but he abused his superior position. A game, a game..."</p>
<p>Before Ruth met Hans Vande, she often had such naive dreams:</p>
<p>"A handsome young knight... He silently reined in his horse beside me, leaned down and picked me up, and placed me on the saddle. Then we set off. On the way, we made a crazy, angry, endless gallop. Later, I fell asleep. In fact, I often seemed to wake up from sleep, but I did not fall asleep, just drove silently in the light air. But when I regained consciousness, I felt tired... I have had such dreams many times."</p>
<p>Since she met Hans Vande, she no longer had such dreams.</p>
<p>They finally got engaged. Although Ruth did not say it, she hoped to get married soon so that she could know the ending of this novel. But women are inherently accustomed to long-term patience. At the same time, they became very intimate, but every time Hans Vande wanted to make a further request besides kissing and hugging, Ruth would definitely shrink back, suppress a scream, and say to her betrothed,</p>
<p>"This is not right. Respect me. I love you. You can do it after I become your wife, but not before marriage. I am happy to play with you, but you want to abuse your privileges. This is not right."</p>
<p>Later, Hans Vande discovered that his physical health...</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>...meant that he could not marry a young girl. He even wrote a letter to Ruth postponing their marriage.</p>
<p>The novel took a turn, and then an accident happened.</p>
<p>That young architect, Leno, now became the knight in Ruth's former dreams.</p>
<p>When Leno first met Ruth, seeing her passion for Hans Vande aroused a kind of amorous envy in him. At first, he was moved by the greatness of the girl's heart, because she loved her lover so respectfully and warmly. Then he felt the floating jealousy that men generally have for each other. He hated Hans Vande, but he could not help but envy his happiness. The desire to replace him naturally arose. He lived in the same house as Ruth. What was originally a mirage-like love took root and grew.</p>
<p>He carefully planned and discovered Hans Vande's ambiguous affair with another woman. He searched for evidence to reveal the secret to Ruth. Leno even admitted to Ruth that he had also enjoyed himself with that woman. He said to Ruth,</p>
<p>"I am immoral, or perhaps, but this is because I was thinking of you... I thought it was ugly that the man to whom you just gave your hand was actually in love with another woman and openly admitted it. I really felt sorry for you. I had seen your gentle and sharp emotions long ago. Yes, it broke my heart."</p>
<p>Needless to say, Ruth was unwilling to forgive Hans Vande's behavior.</p>
<p>Soon, Ruth discovered that Leno was in love with her. Every time she thought of this dangerous question, she would recall the mischief and entertainment she had enjoyed with Han Wan. Suddenly, a blush rose on her face, because she felt ashamed when she recalled the kisses and hugs that made her heart happier than her body. She often said to herself, "I have been insulted. Am I still a virgin?"</p>
<p>Although the sadness had gradually faded, Ruth was still in pain. One night, when she undressed for bed, all the intimacy she had promised Hans Vande came back to her mind. Although her feelings were repulsive, she could not suppress them, and they became shameful physical tremors. She slept in bed, in the warm quilt, and the imagined contact became more frequent and real. Her nerves lost their ability to control, and she fell asleep in a happy fantasy.</p>
<p>On some nights, the situation was particularly urgent. As soon as she entered the room, she seemed to receive a strict command. Close to the mirror, she looked at herself. She stood in front of the mirror and warmly hugged her own shoulders. On some nights, when she used her attitude to encourage Leno to say more gentle words to her, she felt more at peace and more energetic, just like a trusting patient who loves her doctor.</p>
<p>Finally, she completely forgot that Hans Vande had trampled on her poor heart. She had leaned on Hans Vande's...</p>
<p>(Picture: Chicken, photographed by Su Duyu)</p>
<p>...arms before, and now she leaned on Leno's arms in the same way.</p>
<p>When Ruth married Leno, she found the warmth that her nature needed. She was very happy, and the novel ended.</p>

<h3>Liang Xiongwan on the Current Situation of the Educational Film Library in the American Museum of Natural History</h3>
<p>In the past ten years, the American Museum of Natural History in New York City has been continuously lending many educational films to schools for screening. Now, to meet the special needs of primary and secondary schools, the museum is working on the construction of an educational film library. Indeed, educational films that are of great help to students are very necessary, because things like natural science cannot be fully understood unless they are seen with one's own eyes and tested with one's own hands. However, this need is difficult to meet because most schools cannot afford to build an educational film library. Furthermore, teachers often feel it is difficult to know what kind of films they need or where to obtain them to suit the needs of daily textbooks.</p>
<p>In the past few years, with the help of films from the American Mining Company, the National Canadian Film Company, and other companies, the American Museum of Natural History has been diligently and enthusiastically lending many educational films to schools and educational institutions for application. The films are divided into several categories: travel, mining, industry, agriculture, business, etc. These classified films are closely related to ordinary textbooks and have a special relationship with geography, chemistry, technology, biology, economic geography, and other natural sciences. According to detailed statistics, almost all schools in twenty states in the United States rely on the educational films of the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>The museum has now printed a detailed film classification catalog, which makes it very easy for teachers to find the films they need. Furthermore, the films lent out by the museum do not require rental fees. As long as the school can bear the transportation costs, there is no problem with renting the films.</p>
<h3>Special Pavilions in the Relocation of Ise Shrine Exposition</h3>
