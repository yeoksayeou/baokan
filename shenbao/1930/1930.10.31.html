<h3 id="c111">一九三○至一九三一年籃球規則之修正 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>一九三○至一九三一年籃球規則業修正由遠東運動會修正現中華裁判委員譯出並加按語以資醒目茲錄修正之處錄下</p>
<p>第一修第四例加註如下「在罰球區域線之兩旁可　定一區域以爲罰球時安插雙球員之助此種區域應書明「本」「客」二字以示本隊及客隊球員應取之地位」（如圖距端線内五呎處各劃一短線而書字於地面上本隊客隊各以球員一人立於該區以内其餘球員即以此二人爲標準相間而立客之旁爲本本之旁爲客使雙方勢力平均以免互相爭奪地位但此僅屬一種建議並非規則所必需也）</p>
<p>第四條第一例　球之圖周將三十至三十二吋改爲三十至二十一吋球之重量將二十至二十三盎司改爲二十至二十二盎司</p>
<p>第五條第三例　加「球員之由他球員替出者在暫定比賽未重行開始以前不得隨即以替補員資格人場比賽」（即球員巳經正式之手續替出而比賽尚未重行開始前忽又欲重行加入而將另一球員替出此時記錄員及裁判員可拒絶其替補但替出後比賽巳照常進行則雖爲時無多而復以替補員之資格人塲代替他球員者仍爲合格）</p>
<p>第五條第六例　註後加「或聯合數字之易於混亂觀聽者」一句（球昌號數本有避去「一」「二」兩數字之建議然聯俣數字於裁判員之視察及宣吿上頗多不便之處故有此舉）</p>
<p>第七條第三例　加註如下「球員持球在界線近處被對手在一碼距離以内防守致無法進攻而持球至五秒鐘以上者裁判員得宣佈「跳球」（如球員被迫於埸角無轉球或傳球之機會而持球以待至五秒鐘以上則雖對手手未觸球裁判員亦可宣佈跳球以免費耗時問但須注意此則僅適用於球員惟有一面可以活動而爲對手所阻之事若在塲中則雙方均有活動機會此則爲不適用也）</p>
<p>第八條第六例　修正拍球次數爲「跳球時跳球者得將球擊拍兩次但不能兩多其第二次拍球不必仍在圈内在圈外亦可至第二次拍球後於球未觸及其他八球員或地板或藍圈或遮板之前跳球者即不應與球接觸」（按舊規則拍球次數未明白指定且必須在圈内拍擊使球拍出圈外此則球員於拍得可以出圈或仍在圈内再拍一次較前爲活動矣）</p>
<p>第九條第三例　加註如下「初中或更幼之兒童比賽在第一次延長時間後分數仍相等時而必須再行延長者得休息五分鐘且球員得於此休息期中離塲但離場延長時以三次爲限第二次至第三次問仍准休息一分鐘不得離塲」（如在第二次延長時間　了時勝負仍不分者雙方指導員及隊長應先議定方法使在第三次延長時間中雖分數相等亦可判分高下普通所用方法以某隊在第三次延長時間中先得二分者爲勝但各主管機關可各因其所宜而規定之至於第三次延長後雙方積分巳顯高下者當然以分數之多寡判分勝負不用再以先得二分爲標準也</p>
<p>第十條第一例　加裁判須知一則如下「職員對球出界之判决應極明白使雙方不致誤會苟不幸而誤會發生職員應取球在手至雙方有恢復其攻守地位之機會然後交與擲球者但職員無須每次在球出界時親手交球與擲球者也</p>
<p>第十一條第一例　侵入規犯時「暫停時間」當從犯規發生時起至球離罰球者之手爲止如連罰二球以上者則至最後一次球離手時爲止技術犯規及雙方犯規仍舊從犯規發生時起至中圈跳球時爲止</p>
<p>第十三條第六例　本例第一叚最後一句删去以符擲球時犯規處罰之更改</p>
<p>第十四條第七例罰則　修正爲「若因技術犯規而罰球時在球未觸籃圈或遮板前如擲球者踏出罰球線或其同隊球員進入罰球區域者應在中圈跳球而不在最近之罰球線止」（因技術犯規後擲球之進與不進必在中圈跳球若依舊規所在罰球線上跳球發生矛盾故有此修正）</p>
<p>第十四條第八例　加註如下「踢球必須出於故意方行處罰各腿部或足部無心解球不爲違例」（踢球之出於有意或無心雖不易判分然由職員就情下判實較不問原由只以球腿相觸爲違例使比賽多無謂之阻撓爲佳也）　　第十五條第一例戊　跳球時跳球者在未拍球前即離圈進退其罰則仍由違例改作技術犯規但此時若球被另一跳球者在圈内用正當方法將球拍入其本藍内則該球仍爲有效犯規者可以不問（愼勿因犯規而損害不犯規者巳得之利益以該球爲無效而泥於罰球也）</p>
<p>第十五條侵入犯規之罰則　擲籃時發生侵入犯規而球依然擲中者　加罰一球因此而未能擲中者方罰二球罰球未中繼續比賽罰二球時第二球未中者繼續比賽（按上年曾改爲犯規而球仍未擲中者罰二球但第二球中與不中均在中圈跳球則與普通罰球規則予盾今改此法以冀附合而罰一球不中時若繼續比賽得擲中一球可連得四分與前罰二球而不得繼續其價値仍相等且較罰二球可以穏得四分爲公平焉</p>

<p>趙氏演説　工商部駐滬辦事處長趙晋卿氏演説略謂今日孔部長屬來代表致詞余覺今日民窮財乏之際大家没飯吃實因工商凋敝生產太弱之故即以絲綢業而論亦有今不如昔之概然今日之會則可以給我人以一個敎訓即美亞廠巳以十年之努力而得到此良好之效果苟國貨悉能如此則全國工商業之發逹可立而待而民生困苦亦得以解希望美亞綢廠日進無彊爲國貨工商業努力之模範</p>
<p>潘氏演説　市社會局長潘公展氏演説略謂提倡國貨巳非説話時候而爲實行時期提倡國貨祇須國民能盡其職責在可能範圍内儘量購買國貨則國貨自能發逹美亞廠之歷史雖僅十年然其努力之成績在生產方面巳可驚人然則消費方面亦須相同我以爲我國人口衆多祇求自結自足巳能日趨富强初不必以國貨輸出爲大利然綢業在國外之不振亦未必爲不良現象我國民而能努力提倡國貨絲織品則自巳原料由自巳用何憚無銷路耶故美亞廠之前途十分可慶再經十年其發展黨較現在益偉大也</p>

<p>— 苗子</p>
<p>蕭伯訥先生説過「世界上不再有東西像戰爭那様殘酷也不再有東西像母親的愛那様祥和一個母親和伊的子或女好像是並列於一個相等式中母親把伊的心力智慧經騐和財產充分地給伊的子女好像是數學中的「移頃」般的在這一個等式中當子女那邊的數最逹到最高度時而母親那邊的數量便等於零了但世界上没有一個母親不願犧牲了自巳爲伊的子女出力」這一般話眞是雋妙得可愛而又警闢得可佩</p>
<p>然而世界上的做子女的人在他們的母親面前所付的代價常常是不能相低的孝子孝女畢竟是少見反噬的梟獍却在今日的社會新聞中常能讀到我還記得三年前看「慈母」OvertbeHiiil片就深深地感動了在母親的温煦的懷抱中甜睡過的小羔羊們啊你們應該知道怎様熱愛地來報答你們的母親啊</p>
<p>最可慘的乃是做母親的犧牲了自巳去培植伊的子女子女長大了却反而把母親丢開這種事實也多得很不必去找覓什麽眞憑實據試看在寗波有個童話據説是有一個年老的女丐常常在街頭痛駡一般年青的人人家都説伊是個瘋子後來有人知道伊的歷史的才吿訴人家説「伊的兒子還是個留學生而且現在很得意呢那個女人從小撫養伊的兒子到大也煞費心力了那裏知道伊的兒子毛羽豐滿之後便忘了伊母親撫育敎養之恩所以伊才會發瘋啊」</p>
<p>又如最近明星影片公司有一張「娼門賢母」影片内容也是冩一個母親爲要培植伊的女兒忍痛　身娼門爲其女入學之資雖然飽受了閑氣但伊總一心一意的期望於伊的女兒不料後來伊的女兒長大了却發覺了伊的母親在做娼妓不問情由以爲這是自巳的奇恥大辱即不别而行伊的母親知道了急得不得了四面尋訪終成瘋人幾乎送了一條老命後來投河獲救報紙騰載始爲其女兒所見知巳之負母乃歸來探視然而母病巳不救了我們試看這一張影片的情節何等的悱惻動人又何等的深刻呢我希望一般有母親的女兒們能在這一張影片中得至一些敎訓正如一般兒子能在「慈母」影片中得到一些敎訓般那麽明星公司這張「娼門賢母」總算是成功了</p>

<p>— 湯彬</p>
<p>華企雲編著</p>
<p>在列强耽耽敵視我們中國以及積極地圖謀各邊防的現今關於蒙藏一切開掘的事業當然有礙於全國人民生計者至深且鉅最可痛心的就是我們同胞們没有勇氣没有組織下個最大的决心去考察或者去開關然而英人對於西藏日俄人對於蒙古倒非常的重視即如有關此兩處的智識也比較我們來得切實豐富許多有時我們還得將他們所著的書籍拿來做研究和參考的資料這是何等可恥的事華君此書是要求我國邊防的一切重要事業基本的解决所以才有這様偉大的成績顯現於我們的眼前</p>

<p>— 文華</p>
<p>王家域作</p>
<p>本書是一本短篇的集合内共分八篇「螺旋菌」·「秋雨」·「我再也不能愛你了「·「厭倦」·「雨夜」·「銀影」·「父親」·「寳寳」除了末愛一篇「寳寳」外都是一些有生趣和有力的戀愛小説</p>
<p>「螺旋菌」是其中最有精采的一篇突破了世末的肉慾之氣　氣而加以重重的責罰主人翁翰青一個巳經有了純潔的戀人的青年留學日本純純粹粹的可以代表誤陷於色慾中而不可自扳的犧牲者當他在日本將要回國的時候在某種興奮與衝動之下愛上一個日本下女和她儘情的度了兩個肉的夜殊不知在這盡情的放縱之後巳染上這所謂螺旋菌了這在他并不想到更不顧那個眞心愛他的純潔的愛人而只知犯罪地暢快了一時可是這巳經深中下了的毒菌終於陪着他回國了回來後和純潔的戀人</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>度過半個月桃色生活正在訂婚之後他未曾逆料的梅毒發作起來了於是深深的痛悔良心之苛責幾近乎他發狂但一方只得瞞矇看愛人和她的母親到醫院裏去診治愛人知道他的根源之後非但不加以責備和輕視還十分温存的安慰他可是他忍不住這種恥辱終於在第二天自殺了這是作者對於他的取罰</p>
<p>且看作乾借翰青口下喊出來的話吧「現在的蘋妹（就是他的愛人）不是我的了我没有資格再愛她的了……」</p>
<p>「我比什麽都卑鄙我比什麽都汚濁人生的美和快樂與我都没有緣分的了活着還有什麽意味呢……」</p>
<p>作者眞是一個人良心的作家他是怎樣激烈的卑夷犯罪的主人翁而且是怎樣尊敬神聖的愛神於是他就把翰青毫不容情的埋葬了</p>
<p>在此作者揭穿一般世紀末的所謂浪漫的青年把「戀愛神聖」擋在面前做護符實子裏只是在病態的性慾裏撕混更有一般無聊文人打着浪漫派更什麽頽廢派怪肉麻的腔兒作一些無病呻吟千篇一律的平凡乏味的勞什遺害一班盲目的青年這眞是不亦悲夫當今民族精神頽喪到這般田地正須我們青年來反弱爲强的時候我們能夠坐着看這種惡勢力的蔓延麽本書作者雖巳替我們效了來援救這個危機</p>
<p>第二篇「秋雨」我覺得太富於個人享樂主義的色彩内中有段從女主人芷馨口中説出的話可來作證我這小小的觀察</p>
<p>「呀—這多麽富於詩趣的境地呀假使我們兩人能在這裏結三間茅舍了此一生我也别無他求」</p>
<p>這種自私的個人享樂主義者的念頭只是在於一般正浸在桃紅色的夢境裏的人的奢望或者是一般厭世的人只求能舒適了自巳短文的一生就「别無他求」了就是所謂我們的陶潛先生的世外桃源的園主義吧然而至少我們青年總不應該有這種歡念未來的重擔正應該屬於我們青年人來担負固然有些人以爲戀愛是神聖的是至高無尚的爲了戀愛可犧牲一切只要能使愛情圓滿但是我以爲戀愛并不一定是如此的神聖與至高無尚我們只承認戀愛是人類生活中的重要的一部分絶不能以此來定奪了生活的全意義所以我們眞不防戀愛而不能「别無他求」這一點或許是作者不經意地從筆不滑出來的本來用不到這樣嘮叨只是我是十分的希望虔誠的希望作乾能代我們正陷在混蒙中的青年引上這條光明的路上去</p>
<p>「我不能愛你了」本書中要算這篇最長内容最叙述一個文藝作家李澹如他是曾經一度失戀對於戀愛發生了厭惡而定出「戀愛的恩賜是悲劇」的戀愛哲學但是後來在感情衝動之下又重新走上戀愛的道途了他愛上了名呌安那的女郎當他倆正在甜密的愛海裏遊玩的時候從中出了一個十足浪漫氣的美美女士她也熱烈的追求李澹如遺麽一來便形成了一個三角的爭鬥可是澹如呢却一絲兒都不愛美美女士而且討厭她來搗他和安娜間的亂美美用足離間手段就是澹如三翻兩次的拒絶也没用美美仍舊硬着頭皮追逐安娜就因嫉妒而誤會由誤會而忿恨澹如於是他仍舊領回以前的戀愛哲學向安娜忍心的表明「我再也不能愛你了」</p>
<p>這篇東西在描冩方面可以説是成功的只是缺乏了中心意識較第一篇「螺旋菌」遜色一點</p>
<p>從「厭倦」這篇短短的東西裏可以吿訴我們一披在戀愛的波濤中一上一落的人底心理了作者又用盡了他的揭穿的手段原來他們的戀愛是這様的單調他們愛情的最高點也只有拿接吻擁抱等事來表示罷了所以作者替他們喊着「無聊」了作者以這様短的文字能夠寫出這様生動的東西不能不算是精妙了</p>
<p>「兩夜」寫一個巳婚女子之寂寞的心理因爲在婚後不久丈夫就與她分離了於是她苦悶她尋求發洩這苦悶的地方這使她向她的叔叔追求叔叔是很可愛的青年她用盡手段來在他的面前表示但是在他母親的管束之下如不能了這篇東西寫得很緊張而很動人</p>
<p>「父親」的内容似乎有點過於奇緣式述一私生女出世不上四個月父親便因别有他屬而抛棄了她們她活到六歲的時候母親就死了在十六歲的時候以演劇爲職業後來她的父親得識在認親的一節裏以母親後頸項有一顆紅痣爲例證這是奇緣故事中的一個老套似乎不大美麗的</p>
<p>「銀影」和「寳寳」也都還尚佳</p>
<p>總括本書是一部有力的作品能夠捉住人物的心理不過有一點希望作者注意象牙塔裏的孤高自賞者巳不需要於這個時代了希望作者此後進一步爲民族努力這是我誠懇的希望</p>

<p>The Weihaiwei People's Union telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating that the area is impoverished and that any development is entirely dependent on goods. Without customs duties on imports and exports, transit goods are more numerous, commerce is slightly more active, and impoverished people are able to make a living. If customs duties are collected after the area is recovered, transit goods will disappear, resulting in: (1) a sharp decline in commerce, (2) unemployment for laborers, (3) lack of funding for administrative expenses, and (4) an inevitable increase in the burden on the people. Furthermore, the recovery of Weihaiwei is a precursor to the recovery of other concessions. If it gradually declines after recovery, it will hinder the recovery of other concessions.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e11">New Divisions and Alliances in the International Arena <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Since the Great War in Europe, with the exception of Russia and the United States, the countries of the world have gathered under the League of Nations, which is implicitly divided into two groups: the victorious nations and the defeated nations. The sole combination of the victorious nations is based on reparations, and the sole obligation of the defeated nations is also based on reparations. There are few other relationships besides these. However, this situation has changed somewhat recently. The ongoing discord between France and Italy has implicitly divided Europe into two major branches. The remaining Balkan states have formed alliances, and the countries of the Caucasus have joined hands. Although Britain and Germany remain bystanders, they naturally have their own affiliations due to their own interests. Since the peace treaty after the European war, France has been the most powerful country, but today it is also the most envied and is presenting a picture of isolation. Although it is using diplomatic efforts and various strategies to seek redress, it is ultimately difficult to fulfill its wishes. Therefore, today is a period of change in the international arena since the Great War, and the divisions and alliances during this period are worth noting.</p>
<p>In this era of new divisions and alliances in the international arena, the signs of future disputes are becoming increasingly clear. The reason why disputes cannot arise immediately is due to the global economic recession, which is causing economic difficulties for all countries. Another reason is that Soviet Russia is watching closely from the sidelines, and any war will subject each country to domestic disturbances. Otherwise, would the powerful countries that are eager to try truly repent of the disaster of war and be able to live in peace?</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3 id="e12">Eight College Deans of Central University Urge Zhang Naiyan to Return to School <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: The deans of the eight colleges of Central University wrote to Zhang Naiyan, saying, "Yesterday, we received your telegram instructing us to temporarily maintain school affairs. This afternoon at 4 PM, the colleges convened a meeting and unanimously agreed that the situation is critical. Only by inviting you to return to school immediately to preside over affairs can the disputes be resolved and the expectations of the masses be satisfied. Therefore, we are specially sending the deans of the Colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, and Medicine to explain everything in person. We hope that you will prioritize school affairs and respect the opinions of the public, and not continue to hesitate, lest other changes occur." (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Students of Central University, such as Ju Yao, stated that in Zhang Naiyan's letter to the faculty and students, he said, "There are people who can tell who the background figures are behind the repeated disturbances at this school," the meaning of which is ambiguous. On the 30th, they issued an important announcement stating that the purpose of this request for improvement in school affairs is purely based on love for the school, to seek an ideal institution of learning in order to live up to the expectations of the people of the country. As for the skills of boasting and flattery, they are not their forte, and they disdain the practice of sending gifts and receiving favors. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Pro-Japanese tribes refuse to assist in the battle.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 30th: According to news from Taipei, the aborigines withdrew from Wushe yesterday morning, but returned at 6 p.m. last night to launch an attack, engaging in a fierce battle with the defending Japanese police. Two Japanese policemen were killed. A small infantry detachment has rushed to Wushe to provide assistance. According to official sources, when the aborigines withdrew from Wushe yesterday, they took the severed heads with them. Eighty corpses have been found, and 308 people have been injured by the aborigines. It is reported that military and police detachments are currently encircling the aborigines, intending to confine them to one area to prevent them from uniting with other tribes that are also eager to act. However, the site of the uprising is in a mountainous and forested area with very few roads, making it difficult for the army to advance. Extreme caution is required, as the aborigines may be lying in ambush in the forests, ready to launch a surprise attack. When the aborigines counterattacked Wushe, the defending troops were able to repel them with machine guns. An aircraft also dropped bombs to bombard the retreating aborigines. A telegram to the authorities in Wushe suggests that there was no prior preparation. Major newspapers in Tokyo are now paying attention to this point, but the military authorities are actively intending to suppress the rebellion. A headquarters has been established south of Wushe, headed by a certain major general, but the force consists of only two infantry companies, a small number of aircraft and artillery, etc. The plan to conscript pro-Japanese tribes to jointly attack the rioters has failed because they refused to assist, citing the busy agricultural season.</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 30th: The riot of the Taiwan aborigines is very organized. The advisor graduated from Taichung First Middle School and teaches under the Japanese name Hanaoka Ichiro. He is currently a teacher at the Wushe Public School and also serves as a Class B police officer, and is said to be the only intellectual among the aborigines.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Taipei, 30th: Two platoons (two rows) from the Taichung Battalion (one battalion) arrived in Wushe at 7 p.m. on the 29th. In addition, two infantry platoons and a mountain artillery advance team arrived in Liqing at 5 p.m. on the 29th. The Taiwan Garrison Command decided to move the Puli Commander's Office. Commander Kamata, a major general, rushed from Taipei to Puli at 10:10 p.m. on the 29th. Currently, there is one platoon (one row) of mountain artillery, four companies (one company) of infantry, four reconnaissance aircraft, two bombing aircraft, and a 500-man police force in Puli, preparing for active suppression.</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Taipei, 30th: After the Takabei unit occupied Wushe, they collected 86 corpses, all of whom were Japanese, including Takayoshi Ogasawara, the head of Noko District, 13 police officers, 11 men, 23 women, 21 boys, and 27 girls. Fifty-seven Japanese people in Wushe managed to escape. The police substations in the upper area of Wushe were also attacked by the aborigines, and the police officers were brutally murdered.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Taipei, 30th: As of noon on the 29th, the number of survivors found was 48, all of whom were women, wives of police officers, indicating that the police had fought to the death. The survivors were extremely exhausted due to extreme panic and two nights of starvation.</p>

<p>Opening of the Third Session of the Central Executive Committee</p>
<p>The New Economic Policy is the Focus of Discussion</p>
<p>Pacific Press, Moscow, 29th: Bukharin, a famous leader of the Communist Party, has reportedly been expelled for associating with technicians who were prosecuted for sabotaging industry.</p>
<p>Moscow: The Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Russian Federation, which is somewhat similar to the parliaments of various countries, began its autumn session on the 28th of this month in the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow. Approximately 400 male and female representatives from all over the country attended. The meeting was declared open by Chairman Kalinin. The hall was resplendent, with pillars and columns made of marble. The attending representatives were mostly dressed in coarse clothing, mostly as farmers or workers. The presidium consisted of 21 people. The chairmen of the various autonomous federations of the Soviet Union were seated at a long table covered with red cloth, with Kalinin at the head. All speeches were broadcast to the entire audience through loudspeakers. This session of the Central Executive Committee is the third since it was elected by the All-Union Congress of Soviets. Generally, the main discussions will focus on various issues concerning the five-year new agricultural and industrial economic policy. In addition, the new Foreign Affairs Commissioner, Litvinov, may give a report on foreign policy. According to the agenda, the first item to be discussed will be the development plan for this year's business year, which began on the 1st of this month. After a report by a representative of the People's Committee, a debate will begin. According to the Russian Central Executive Committee's mission, it does not create any laws or plans, but merely approves the government's various activities. However, the results of the debates are regarded as the opinions of the people and sometimes serve as a guide for government action. The entire meeting is expected to last about ten days. As for the General Secretary of the Communist Party, Stalin, he is not a member of the government. Although he is also present at the Central Executive Committee, he is only a guest. (World)</p>

<p>National News, Ankara, 29th: Hungarian Prime Minister Count Bethlen is visiting Turkey and has arrived here. The press has welcomed him with enthusiasm, almost as much as when Greek Prime Minister Venizelos visited. At the welcome banquet hosted by Turkish Prime Minister Ismet Pasha, both sides gave speeches expressing friendship. The Turkish Prime Minister said that Hungary and Turkey are brotherly countries, as close as lips and teeth, and that their close cooperation is essential for maintaining peace in the Balkans and the Near East. The Hungarian Prime Minister replied that Hungary had striven to invite Turkey to participate in the discussion of the European Federation in Geneva. He also expressed his welcome to the Turkish Prime Minister's statement that the word "revision" is indispensable in the international dictionary.</p>

<p>National Opinion is Boiling</p>
<p>National News, Cairo, 30th: After dissolving the parliament, King Fuad of Egypt successively dissolved the provincial councils. The Wafd Party convened a general assembly to protest this, but the government prevented it from doing so. National opinion is boiling. The government is taking strict precautions, fearing that a revolution may occur. However, judging from the current situation, it may not be easy to suppress this movement. It is difficult to predict whether there will be any changes in the next few days. On the one hand, the Wafd Party is loudly proclaiming its determination to fight to the end for the constitutional rights of the people.</p>

<p>Another Victory for the Brüning Cabinet</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 29th: Motions to abolish the Young Plan and suspend reparations payments, proposed successively by the National People's Party, the National Socialist Party, and the Communist Party, have all been rejected by the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee. The committee has now passed a motion by the Economic Party requiring the government to immediately publish a blue book listing all the reparations payments made by Germany since the armistice, whether in cash or in kind, in order to prove that the amount of reparations under the Young Plan, together with the money and goods previously delivered, far exceeds the direct and indirect war losses actually suffered by the Allied Powers. It remains to be seen whether the Young Plan can still be regarded as consistent with the principles stipulated in Chapter VIII of the Treaty of Versailles. The rejection of the motions by the left and right radical factions can be seen as another victory for the Brüning cabinet and the moderate faction. The moderate faction believes that it is unwilling to adopt a radical policy on the reparations issue, so that even the most moderate elements among the former Allied Powers would take hostile action against Germany. At this time, if a moderate approach is taken to prove that the Young Plan is actually unsustainable for Germany and is a major cause of the current global economic panic, then the Allied Powers may be somewhat willing to reconsider the reparations issue.</p>

<p>National News, Addis Ababa, 29th: The new ruler of Abyssinia, Ras Tafari, will hold the coronation ceremony on Sunday to become Emperor of Ethiopia. Envoys from various countries have arrived here. The British representative, the Duke of Gloucester, and his entourage are staying in the former palace of the new ruler. The ceremony will be held in a specially built hall inside St. George's Cathedral. The carriage used for the ceremony is the former carriage of the German Emperor, newly purchased from Berlin. The six horses are all thoroughbreds from Austria. The walls of the hall are only half-built so that the public can watch the coronation remotely from behind the walls. The coronator is the Archbishop, assisted by dozens of priests, all wearing colorful gold-trimmed robes. The imperial crown was also transported from the old capital of Aksum and will be returned to its original storage place after the ceremony. The coronation ceremony is scheduled to begin at 7:30 a.m., followed by a prayer ceremony. The imperial carriage will then return to the palace. News reporters and spectators from all over the world are arriving in succession, and there is not enough accommodation in the hotels, so temporary shelters are being built.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 29th: Australian Prime Minister Scullin issued a radio message today regarding the Imperial Conference, saying that the Imperial Conference is currently working to adapt the internal political system of the Empire to its new identity. If this is successful, the theoretical limitations on the legislative power of overseas autonomous territories will be removed, and the British Parliament will recognize the equal status of the British and overseas autonomous governments and parliaments, and place them on an equal legal footing. He believes that this work can be successful. Thereafter, the laws of the autonomous territories, even if they do not conform to British law, should not be considered invalid. As for the economic aspect, he believes that the Imperial Conference has given excellent impetus to the idea of closer economic cooperation, and it will soon have an effect. As far as the issue of tax rates is concerned, this matter is large and complex, so it would not be disappointing if this meeting does not have many concrete resolutions. This issue must continue to be studied. However, he hopes that before the meeting closes, it can at least stipulate a path for the people of Britain and the autonomous territories to move towards a greater common goal of unity on economic matters.</p>

<p>The French Government politely Refuses</p>
<p>National News, Paris, 29th: Recently, the British government sent a note to the French government requesting that the principal and interest on French war bonds purchased by the British be repaid in gold coins. Yesterday, the French government rejected this, stating that it could not agree to compensate the British for the losses suffered due to the depreciation of the franc, because British bondholders and French bondholders are in the same position and should not be treated differently, which would cause French bondholders to receive different treatment. The French newspapers have expressed their support for the government's rejection, believing that France cannot discriminate against foreign creditors and give special treatment to the British. If this action were to be implemented, it would set a bad precedent and cause difficulties in international law. Furthermore, if France accepts the British government's request, it will open the door to large-scale fraud.</p>

Then, the British would be in a stronger position to conduct international negotiations to correct the current chaos in the world's financial system.

<h3 id="e78">Representatives from Eastern Jiangxi Come to Nanjing to Petition <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Request Telegrams to Jiangxi and Anhui Authorities to Jointly Suppress Fang Zhimin</p>
<p>This time, Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, was captured by Fang Zhimin leading a mob, and the local people suffered greatly. According to the representatives who came to Nanjing from the county to petition, the bandit Fang has been entrenched in eastern Jiangxi for several years. In the past two years, he has repeatedly attacked Yiyang and Dexing, and captured Jingdezhen and Leiping (all wealthy areas), desperately plundering money and collecting firearms. His supplies of provisions and weapons have become increasingly abundant. This summer, he gathered no less than seven or eight thousand people in Poyang and Duchang, and the number of people who invaded Pengze this time was about two or three thousand, which was only a small part of the bandits. On the afternoon of the 16th of this month, at about 7 p.m., the bandits entered the city with extraordinary secrecy, causing the people to flee in panic. The police team of the county had heard something about it beforehand, but because they were outnumbered, they had to temporarily retreat across the river to Anhui Province to avoid their attack. It was not until the 19th that the navy, using the Lianjing and Weisheng warships, bombarded the bandits from across the river. The bandits had no cover and had no choice but to retreat slightly. They are now still occupying the area around Huangtuling to Xiaojialing outside the South Gate. This place is located in a strategic location, a thoroughfare for Pengze and Poyang, and the terrain is rugged and easy to hide in. If they are not suppressed quickly, they will spread and become difficult to control, and it is feared that they will not be able to avoid becoming a continuation of Ninggang and Jinggangshan. People from the county who took refuge in Anqing have repeatedly telegraphed the provincial authorities to request troops to pursue and suppress the bandits. Many days have passed with no news. Liu Huimei, Ding Maolin, and others were specially dispatched to Nanjing overnight. Yesterday (the 29th), together with fellow villagers living in Nanjing, they petitioned the National Government. The civil service office sent Section Chief Wang to meet with them, accept the petition, and promise to forward it. It is said that the county's losses this time, just in terms of the county seat, are no less than several million. It is impossible to investigate the situation in the villages, which is truly an unprecedented disaster. The petition is recorded below: [A petition for requesting telegrams to the military and political authorities of Jiangxi and Anhui provinces to dispatch elite troops to jointly suppress the bandits in Pengze to save the lives of the people and protect the overall situation. Due to Jiangxi's misfortune, the Communists are all over the place. This time, the bandit Fang Zhimin led thousands of bandits to invade Pengze from Poyang on the 16th of this month, suddenly capturing the county seat. For a time, the flames were raging and the sound of crying shook the sky. The burning, killing, and looting were unbearable to hear. It was not until the 19th that the navy attacked from the river and the bandits retreated to Huangtuling outside the South Gate, which is still only 20 miles from the city. Now, the villages in the four borders are mostly empty, and tens of thousands of refugees are fleeing to Anhui Province, supporting the old and carrying the young, without enough clothes to cover their bodies and enough food to fill their stomachs. The representatives witnessed this and were heartbroken. They repeatedly telegraphed the provincial authorities, urging them to quickly send troops to suppress the bandits to save the lives of the people. However, the telegrams have been sent for many days and have been ignored. Since the national army has not arrived, the bandits are gathering in the surrounding villages, demanding everything from household to household, and the burning and killing are becoming more intense. They are now actively organizing a Soviet government, establishing a Communist Party headquarters, and implementing the search and burning of contracts and the excavation of field cavities. The previous examples of Hailufeng are chilling. In this situation, the lives and property of the people are completely lost, not to mention the more dangerous situation. The representatives believe that Pengze is located on the Yangtze River, adjacent to Anhui Province, and is a strategic location and a shield for Jiangxi Province. The Madang Fortress is particularly dangerous. If the bandits regain their position and obstruct traffic, and spy on Nanchang, the encirclement will be complete and the province's predicament will be worrisome. If we continue to sit idly by, the disaster will spread. Not only will the millions of people in Pengze be exposed to the sword and arrow, but it is feared that Jiangxi's shield will not be protected and the situation on the Yangtze River will be dangerous. Therefore, we specially rushed to Nanjing overnight to petition, requesting that you quickly telegraph Chairman Lu to immediately dispatch elite troops to Pengze County and Madang to suppress the bandits, and at the same time order the authorities of Anhui Province to send troops to Qiupu and Dongliu to cross the border and join forces to suppress the bandits, so as to avoid endless disasters. If this group is completely wiped out first, then Jiangxi's gateway will be secure and the disaster of the bandits in the interior can be prevented. Otherwise, empty words of suppressing bandits will only deepen the suffering of the people, and merely defending the province will mean that the gateway has already been lost. How can we alleviate the central government's worries and comfort the people in the disaster area? Therefore, we earnestly implore you to have compassion for the disaster victims, approve our request, and quickly telegraph the military and political authorities of Jiangxi and Anhui provinces to dispatch troops to Qiupu and other counties to jointly suppress the bandits in order to save the people from fire and water and stabilize the overall situation. We present our words with tears in our eyes, unable to express our urgency as we await your orders. Liu Huimei, Ding Maolin, and others, representatives of the disaster victims in Pengze County, Jiangxi Province.</p>

<p>Bandit Suppression Divisions United as One</p>
<p>Hu Zuyu's Troops Have Arrived in Jiujiang</p>
<p>According to a Nanchang communication from the 9th Route Army Headquarters, the main force of the Communist bandits Zhu and Mao is currently along the Gan River in Jianxia, Ji'an. The Peng and Huang factions are along the Yuan River in Fenyi and Xinyu. The 18th Division of the bandit suppression troops is still on the line of Zhangshu, Xingan, and Qingjiang. The New 5th Division is in Gaoan, and the New 13th Division is in Fuzhou. There has been no major change. The general attack order is expected to be issued in early next month. However, recently, the Zhu, Peng, and Huang factions attacked and captured Shanggao from Xinyu and Jianxia, attempting to cut off the connection between Yuanzhou's Luo Lin and Gaoan's Gong Bingfan. Fortunately, Luo, the commander of the 77th Division, ordered Tao's brigade to garrison Yuanzhou. Yi and Xi's two brigades launched a fierce attack on the bandits in Shanggao from Yuanzhou, and on the 27th, they recovered Shanggao, killing countless bandits. The 9th Route Army Headquarters received a report from Commander Luo detailing the situation, which stated that early this morning, Yi and Xi's two brigades, led by Yuan, searched and suppressed the bandits along the way through Licun and Yangqiao. The troops advanced to Hantang. Gan Yin ordered Yi's brigade to break through the bandits in Meiyuegang through Xiongtang and personally led Xi's brigade through Jiangkou to recover Shanggao at noon. Many bandits were killed successively. According to prisoners, the bandits used the 3rd, 4th, 12th, and 20th armies to attack Shanggao from Xiajiang through Xinyu, attempting to cut off the connection between Luo and Gong's divisions. Fortunately, they were all defeated by us. After Luo's victory in Shanggao, a part of the Communist bandits advanced from Qingjiang Shanggao to Gaoan. The Chen Guangyao and Luo Shouyi brigades of the 50th Division immediately set off from Shengmi and Wanshou Palace in Ganjiang and advanced towards Gaoan. The Gong Bingfan division in Gaoan then moved upwards to Shanggao to connect with Luo's division. Therefore, a line has been formed from Pingxiang through Yuanzhou, Shanggao, and Gaoan to Nanchang.</p>
<p>The Jiujiang and Nanchang-Xunyang Road in northern Jiangxi are extremely important. After Liu Yi's brigade opened Fengxin and Jing'an, the 20th Division of Xu Kexiang was stationed there. Xu originally planned to open the Raozhou-Jingdezhen area in eastern Jiangxi after the 5th Division arrived in Jiujiang. Currently, the 28th and 29th regiments of the 5th Division of Hu Zuyu have arrived in Jiujiang. Hu took a special train on the Nanchang-Xunyang Road to the province on the 28th to ask Commander Lu for instructions and plans to stay for a day or two before returning to Xunyang to defend. In order to consolidate the rear and mobilize the people to participate in the eradication of the Communists, the municipal government, the provincial capital public security bureau organized watch teams, while the city party headquarters organized anti-communist groups and propaganda teams to promote publicity.</p>

<p>Requesting Resignation or Possible Reduction of His Troops</p>
<p>To Meet with Commander Chen in Wu and Then Enter Hospital for Treatment</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Cai Tingkai, Commander of the Sixtieth Division, recently led his troops back south after participating in the battles along the Longhai and Pinghan lines. His troops are temporarily stationed in Hanzhong. Commander Cai himself, due to stomach illness, returned to Guangdong alone for treatment. On the 24th, he arrived in Hong Kong on the President Coolidge from Shanghai. After staying in Hong Kong for one night, he took a Foshan ship back to Guangdong on the 25th. The ship arrived in the province at 2:15 PM. Prior to this, various heads of agencies flocked to the pier to welcome him. Commander Cai shook hands with each person as a greeting, and then took a car to the Eighth Route Army Headquarters to rest. He returned to his private residence at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. The press rushed to interview him. According to Cai's remarks, roughly speaking, a month ago, he led the Sixtieth Division to Hanzhong. At that time, it was planned that the Sixtieth Division would be responsible for the Jinpu Line, and the Sixty-first Division would be responsible for the Longhai Line. Later, the plan changed and they jointly attacked Tai'an, and then captured Jinan. After the remnants of Yan's troops crossed the river and retreated, the Sixtieth and Sixty-first Divisions were ordered to transfer to the Pinghan and Longhai lines, successively attacking Xinzheng, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Lanfeng, with irresistible force. Feng's troops were defeated and fled in disarray. The Central Army thus achieved a triumphant return. Feng and Yan's losses in this defeat were no less than 150,000 men. The losses of our army were comparable to those during the campaign against Gui, but with repeated replenishments, our strength remained intact. Now, the troops are gathered in Hanzhong. Once the Central Government's orders are received, they will go south to suppress bandits, but the destination will be determined at that time and cannot be announced in advance. The Eighth Route Army is now fully capable of dealing with the remnants of the Gui province forces. If necessary, the Nineteenth Route Army can also join in. As for the resignation issue, I am quite determined. Previously, when this division was under the Eleventh Army, it received orders to reduce its size, and the Tenth Division was reduced to a brigade. Then, due to the military emergency, it was expanded back into a division. I will only follow the Central Government's orders. Now that the national military has been pacified, I am specially returning military power to the Central Government and awaiting its disposition. If the Central Government does not approve my resignation, I request that my troops be reduced in size to save military expenses and engage in construction. In the near future, I plan to take leave for rest and recuperation. Once I have time, I will go to Wu to meet with Commander Chen Jitang to report on the Northern Expedition, and then return to the province to enter the hospital for treatment, making sure to eliminate the root of the illness to avoid recurrence of stomach problems.

General Manager Ma Guanhe (i.e., Ma Huijie) was in charge for ten years and incurred a debt of 1.2 million yuan. When the company was reorganized in the 14th year of the Republic, the board of directors decided to dismiss Ma Guanhe and issue 1.2 million yuan in bonds to repay the debt. In the past six years, 400,000 yuan had been repaid successively. Unexpectedly, recently, Kagawa Shoichi, the general manager of the Japanese-owned Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha, entrusted Yoshida Kan, a Japanese, as his representative, and also engaged Mou Shaozhou, a lawyer from Qingdao, as the Japanese representative's deputy. They filed a lawsuit in the Jinan District Court, claiming that Ma Guanhe, the former general manager of the telephone company, borrowed 420,000 Japanese yen from the company in the tenth year of the Republic, using the telephone company's machinery, land, and materials as collateral. In addition to repaying 20,000 Japanese yen on March 10th of the twelfth year and paying interest on November 3rd of the same year, the principal and interest have not been paid since then. They requested the court to order the defendants Ma Guanhe and the Jinan Telephone Company to jointly repay the principal and interest, and also requested provisional execution. After the District Court approved the request and issued a summons, Judge Fei Yinshou heard the case. Yesterday (the 28th), the court ruled that the telephone company should repay the Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha a total of more than 600,000 Japanese yen in principal and interest, equivalent to more than 1 million yuan in national currency, and announced provisional execution. It is heard that the telephone company was unaware that Ma Guanhe borrowed money from the Japanese-owned Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha. Although some directors signed the contract, it was handled solely by Ma Guanhe, and all the directors were unaware. When the company was reorganized, accountant Xie Lin checked all the accounts, and the 1.2 million yuan in debt included only the price of machinery from the German-owned Siemens foreign firm, and the remaining funds were loans from banks and firms in Jinan and Tianjin, with no interest-bearing loans from Japanese businessmen. Therefore, the occurrence of this incident was completely unexpected. Currently, in addition to declaring an appeal, the company is also submitting a request to the provincial government, municipal government, and the Department of Agriculture and Mines to preside over the matter on their behalf, and sending a letter to the court to revoke the provisional execution. At the same time, Ma Guanhe is ordered to appear in court to clarify the situation. All circles in commercial Jinan believe that this matter concerns China's transportation industry and cannot allow foreigners to encroach upon it, and are preparing to unanimously support it to protect sovereignty.

<h3 id="e83">Shi Yousan Passes Through Tianjin to Shenyang <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Visiting Zhang Xueliang to Discuss Defense Matters</p>
<p>His Troops Concentrated Around Zhangde</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: After Shi Yousan withdrew his troops to the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, he sent personnel to beg Zhang Xueliang and Han Fuju to intercede with the Central Government to allow him to surrender. Shi is a native of Jilin and has local ties to the Northeast, so Zhang Xueliang intends to promote him. It is heard that he has asked the Central Government to grant him the title of Commander-in-Chief. To show his sincerity to Zhang, Shi set off from Zhangde on the 21st and took a special train to Shenyang to meet with Zhang Xueliang. Before leaving, he telegraphed Zhang to explain his intention to visit, and Zhang telegraphed back to express his welcome. Shi then departed. His special train entered the Beining Railway at Changxindian, so it did not enter Beiping. It arrived in Tianjin at 6:00 AM today (the 23rd). Zhang Xueming, the director of the Tianjin Municipal Police Bureau, and Liu Hongru, the adjutant to Wang Shuchang, and Wang Dexin, the chief of the general staff, personally went to the station to welcome him. Those who came with Shi included Secretary-General Zhang Yunze and Bi Guangtan, the director of the Construction Department when Shi was the chairman of Shandong Province, Sun Tieling, a senator, as well as adjutants, staff officers, and hundreds of guards. Lin Jiaxun, the artillery commander of the army, took a special train as a pilot train, arriving in Tianjin half an hour before Shi. Qin Jianbin, whom Shi sent to Jinan to visit Han Fuju, also rushed from Jinan at about 11:00 AM to report on the negotiations. After getting off the train, Shi went to pay his respects to Wang Shuchang, Zhang Xueming, and other military and political figures, and went to his residence at No. 6 Road in the British Concession to rest. (This residence was the property of Li Sihao and was sold to Shi for 100,000 yuan.) Wang Shuchang hosted a banquet for Shi at 4:00 PM in the large reception hall of the provincial government to welcome him, and invited Shi's senior officers and Zhang Xueming, Zang Qifang, and others to accompany him. After the banquet, when interviewed, Shi stated that the purpose of his trip to the Northeast could be divided into two: first, because the Central Government ordered that all military affairs in the north be under the responsibility of Deputy Commander Zhang, and Zhang recently sent a telegram inviting him to meet, so he went to discuss the issue of defense zones; second, because his father was ill and he needed to return home to visit him. He planned to stay for about a week. His army is currently stationed in the area of Xinxiang, Weihui, Xunde, Zhangde, and Daokou, and a portion of it has been deployed to Daming, because there are miscellaneous troops such as Liu Guitang and Xue Chuanfeng causing disturbances in that area, so they were sent to protect local security. Liu and others have already fled elsewhere. The defense zone of his army is connected to the Northeast Army according to the orders of Deputy Commander Zhang. Currently, the area south of Zhangde is the responsibility of his army, and the area north of Zhangde is the responsibility of the Northeast Army's cavalry. A large portion of the Northeast Army has already arrived in Shijiazhuang. Lu Zhonglin is leading a large portion of the remnants of the Second Route Army in northern Henan, and a portion has entered southern Shanxi. Sun Lianzhong's troops are now in Jiaozuo, and Han Fuju is interceding with the Central Government to allow them to surrender. Since each unit is willing to submit to the Central Government at this time, they must wait for the Central Government to reorganize them, and most of them are in negotiations. He has not yet been appointed as Commander-in-Chief by the Central Government, but today he received a telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang saying that the Central Government has approved it. Because the telegram was encrypted, he was unable to translate it and does not know which route it is. His army currently has more than 60,000 men, 80% of whom have guns. Yan Xishan previously designated the three southern prefectures of Hebei for his army to raise funds, but the current situation has changed and it is only able to maintain supplies. Shi's special train left Tianjin for Shenyang at about 6:00 PM that afternoon. (October 23)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Northeast Unified Telecommunications Administration <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Northeast Communications Committee, in order to implement unified administration, command, supervision, and inspection of telegraph, telephone, and radio communications within the provinces and regions of the Northeast, planned to organize a General Telecommunications Bureau in September of this year. However, it was not realized due to circumstances. Recently, after Zhu Guangmu took over as the director of the Administration Bureau, he presented the previous proposal to the Communications Committee for continued organization and implementation. The name of the Administration Bureau remains the same. The Communications Committee will establish a Northeast Telecommunications Administration Office directly under the Communications Committee. According to its organizational content, all current duties of the Telecommunications Administration Bureau and the Shenyang Telegraph, Telephone, and Radio Bureaus/Stations will be concurrently handled by the Northeast Telecommunications Administration Office. The original positions of Director of the Shenyang Telegraph Bureau, Director of the Provincial City Telephone Bureau, and Director of the Radio Station will all be abolished. A Chief of Operations will be established to handle the affairs of the bureaus and stations. All agencies under the jurisdiction of the Administration Office, all radio stations, all long-distance and city telephone bureaus, and telegraph bureaus within the Northeast region will be directly under it. The Administration Office will have a Director appointed by the Communications Committee. It is heard that Zhu Guangmu has been appointed to fill the position. The internal structure of the office is divided into four sections: General Affairs, Operations, Engineering, and Accounting. A Chief Engineer will also be established. The responsibilities of the office are roughly divided into the following items: (1) Matters concerning the appointment, removal, transfer, and evaluation of directors and branch directors of each bureau/station; (2) Matters concerning the evaluation of technical, reporting, and telephone staff; (3) Matters concerning the investigation of local military, political, industrial, and commercial conditions and whether to increase or abolish telecommunications bureaus/stations; (4) Matters concerning the investigation of reporting and telephone business conditions and whether to raise or lower the level of each bureau/station; (5) Matters concerning construction, improvement, or development plans; (6) Matters concerning the supervision of the income and expenditure of each bureau/station; (7) Matters concerning appeals and inquiries from local groups or merchants and contacts with local public affairs; (8) Matters concerning matters assigned by order. Regarding the above plan, the Communications Committee previously convened meetings with the Telecommunications Administration Bureau, the General Radio Station, the Provincial City Telegraph Bureau, the Shenyang Telephone Bureau, and other related parties to discuss the establishment of the Administration Office and the established organizational outline, and a general decision has been made. It is heard that it is scheduled to be established on the first of next month.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Local Sino-Russian Trade in Heihe <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>A Treaty Concluded by the Head of the Municipal Administration Office and the Russian Consul</p>
<p>To be Cancelled After the Promulgation of the Formal Sino-Russian Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: In June of this year, the Soviet Consul stationed in Heihe, Korniev, and Zhang Shouzeng, the head of the Heihe Municipal Preparatory Office, met in Heihe to discuss the issue of Sino-Russian international river navigation markers. At that time, the Russian Consul raised the issue of local trade in Heihe, requesting that both sides conclude a temporary local Sino-Russian commercial treaty in Heihe before the formal Sino-Russian commercial treaty was approved. Zhang, believing that the matter was of great importance, agreed to discuss it after the issue of navigation markers was resolved. However, the Soviet Far East has been suffering from food shortages in recent years and is in dire need of Chinese grain and groceries to provide relief, especially in the vicinity of Hailanpao. Therefore, after the issue of international river navigation markers was resolved, the Russian Consul raised the issue of trade again. Zhang Shouzeng reported the situation to the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, which in turn reported it to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee. The Central Government telegraphed back a month ago, believing that since the Sino-Soviet Conference had already opened, local trade could be opened to show generosity if it did not harm national sovereignty, and instructed the Northeast side to consider it. The Political Affairs Committee, in accordance with this instruction, ordered Zhang Shouzeng to consult with the Russian Consul in Heihe in good faith, ensuring that it did not violate the general Sino-Russian treaty. Although a temporary treaty has been concluded, it must be revoked when the formal Sino-Russian commercial treaty is approved. On the 19th of this month, Zhang Shouzeng and the Russian Consul in Heihe agreed on a full treaty consisting of eleven articles and have submitted it to the highest authorities of both China and Russia for approval. The Russian side has recently been preparing to establish a state-owned commercial representative office and other commercial institutions in Heihe. Chinese officials and merchants in Heihe have also raised 100,000 yuan to establish the Northeast Trading Company. It is expected that the development of Sino-Russian commerce will begin after the treaty is approved. Heihe has been extremely desolate in recent years. If local trade is allowed, it may return to prosperity. (October 22)</p>
<h3 id="e86">CER to Establish Translation Office <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>To be Established on November 1</p>
<p>Russians Have Deep Intentions to Manipulate</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) Translation Office, decided by Russian Director Rufaev, has appointed Wu Hongyou, Chief of the General Affairs Department, Cai Yunchang, Chief of the Sino-Russian Secretariat, Sun Yutang, Director of Translation, and Russian Directors Niechieff, Yacoulev, and Krimiankoff as preparatory committee members. They are required to report the preparation situation to the Director by the 27th of this month so that it can be formally established on the 1st of next month. Cai Yunchang, the Chief of the Sino-Russian Secretariat, will be transferred to be the director of the office, but the formal and deputy titles have not yet been determined. After the Translation Office is established, the original Sino-Russian Secretariat and the Translation Section of the General Affairs Department will be merged into it. All personnel will also be transferred to serve in the office. However, the name of the Translation Office is directly translated from Russian, which the Chinese side considers inappropriate. Therefore, it is planned that the preparatory committee will submit the regulations to the Council for approval so that they can be determined. The initial intention of the Russian Director was to establish the Translation Office on October 1. However, the Chinese directors unanimously opposed it, believing that once the translators from each department were transferred to serve in the Translation Office, it would be inconvenient for each department to handle affairs. Therefore, they requested a delay in the establishment. After a second study by the Chinese and Russian Councilors, it was approved that each department would retain two or three translators to serve in their own department, while the rest would be transferred to serve in the Translation Office. The Chinese directors, realizing that it was impossible to fundamentally overturn the decision, stopped opposing it. Therefore, the Russian Director ordered that the Translation Office be organized and established on November 1. The internal structure of the Translation Office is roughly divided into four sections: Technical, Document, Literary, and Accounting. The annual expenditure of the entire office is 5 million rubles, and there are approximately 100 employees. The Russian Director initially expected that the Russian directors would also oppose this proposal at the board meeting. However, at the second meeting, they all changed their attitude and unanimously supported it. Therefore, some researchers have made a thorough study of the key to this. After a certain Chinese director discovered it, it was believed that the Russian side wanted to restrict the Chinese side's use of personnel and control the affairs of each department, so they concentrated the translation talents to invisibly resist this. This is because the Russian side knows that the Chinese side lacks specialized technical talents, so they use this strategy. (October 22)</p>

<p>Inspection Scheduled to be Completed in Three Weeks</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Zhang Lisheng, the commander of the Cavalry Group Army and the commander of the Second Cavalry Division, since concurrently serving as the Road Protection Commander of the Pupu section of the Jinpu Line, his troops, except for the Eighth and Eleventh Regiments stationed in eastern Henan, are all distributed in the southern section of the Jinpu Line, responsible for road protection and bandit suppression. In order to train his troops into an elite force, Zhang has decided that Deputy Division Commander Jiang Kanru will personally go to the defense area along the line from November 1 to conduct inspections separately. He has ordered all units to concentrate in Bengbu, Guzhen, Mingguang, Chuzhou, Wuyi, Puzhen, etc. to await inspection. Jiang is also preparing everything and is scheduled to depart from Bengbu on the 1st with staff officer Mo Jinlong and others. His itinerary is planned to first go to Mingguang, then to Chuzhou and Puzhen, then return to Guzhen and Bengbu, and then go to Linhuai before returning to Bengbu. The inspection is scheduled to be completed in three weeks. It is heard that the inspection of each unit will be conducted separately, including the number of personnel, horses, weapons, ammunition, clothing, equipment, technical subjects, hygiene education, etc., and will also conduct field combat exercises and live ammunition shooting. Oral examinations will also be conducted separately for officers and soldiers in order to assess their training. (October 29)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Recent News from the Guizhou Scientific Survey Team of the Academia Sinica <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the National Museum of Natural History of the Academia Sinica has spared no effort in its work. In addition to continuously studying the various specimens obtained in Guangxi in previous years and publishing them in the museum's journal, Sinensia, it has also conducted detailed collections near Beijing. Last year, it sent personnel to Sichuan to collect animals, with excellent results. Because the animals and plants in Guizhou Province have not been thoroughly investigated by domestic and foreign experts, the museum specially organized a Guizhou Natural Science Survey Team this year, dividing it into animal and plant groups. Chang Linding, Tang Ruijin, Fang Zilian, and Tang Kaipin were assigned as animal group investigators, Jiang Ying and Huang Zhi as plant group investigators, and Lin Yingshi as secretary, stationed in Guiyang to manage rear affairs. After the organization was completed, it departed from Beijing on April 11, passed through Chongqing, Sichuan, and arrived in Tongzi County in northern Guizhou Province on May 12 and began the investigation. A large number of animal and plant specimens were collected in the Loushan Pass area. It arrived in Zunyi County in the south and investigated for half a month before arriving in Guiyang on June 13 and staying at the provincial government's reception center in Zhongshan Park. Chairman Mao and the heads of various departments held a banquet to welcome the team. After resting briefly in the province, the team formulated a route and set off in two teams for investigation. One team went west to counties such as Dingfan, Guangshun, Pingba, Xiuwen, Qianxi, Dading, Bijie, Weining, and Shuicheng. The other team went east to counties such as Longli, Guiding, Duyun, Maha, and Bazhai, and then turned south to counties such as Sanhe, Libo, and Dushan, and then along the west to counties such as Pingzhou, Datang, and Luohue. In the four months since the investigation began, the plant group has obtained many kinds of medicinal materials, fungi, and timber, and collected more than 4,000 numbers of plant specimens, totaling about 60,000 to 70,000 copies. The animal group obtained more than 1,600 pairs of birds, totaling more than 180 species, more than 2,000 fish, totaling more than 150 species, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, etc., totaling more than 80 species, totaling more than 200 copies, and more than 4,000 pieces of invertebrates. In addition, it also obtained live animals such as civet cats, otters, yellow muntjacs, monkeys, bears, pigs, and badgers. It is heard that the team is still continuing its investigation and is expected to return to Beijing at the end of February next year.</p>

<p>Imposter Exposed and Arrested: At the Liangxi Inn on Tongyun Road outside the Guangfu Gate in Wuxi, six people from Hubei Province, including Xiang Chongkai, Wang Bingxun, Xiang Renfa, Feng Futian, Huang Mingjue, and Xiang Zhenyi, were staying in room number 19. Xiang Chongkai, who appeared to be around forty years old, wore a long gown and mandarin jacket and behaved in a generous manner. He claimed to have been commissioned by the provincial government as the Director of the Wuxi Municipal Public Security Bureau. The day before yesterday, he fabricated a telegram and sent someone to Zhenjiang to have it telegraphed. The telegram was addressed to Xu Jigui, the Director of the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau, and was signed by Ye Chucang, the Chairman of the Provincial Government. The telegram stated that Xiang Chongkai was a loyal and capable person and should be given a job. Director Xu received the telegram and reasoned that since there was no municipal government established in Wuxi, there could not be a Municipal Public Security Bureau Director, and that if Chairman Ye were to recommend someone, he would first contact County Magistrate Pan and would not directly telegraph him. Director Xu immediately took the telegram to County Magistrate Pan for instructions. Pan also found the telegram to be suspicious and ordered Director Xu to telegraph Chairman Ye for instructions. He received a reply stating that there was no such matter and ordered him to send someone to arrest Xiang. After receiving the telegram, Director Xu secretly dispatched Detective Team Leader Shen Minhua and Detective Tang Yaoting to room 19 of the Liangxi Inn. They first tricked Xiang Chongkai into going to the bureau and placed him under strict surveillance. Then, they returned to the inn and arrested Wang Bingxun, Xiang Renfa, Feng Futian, Huang Mingjue, and Xiang Zhenyi. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, Wang Zhonghu, the head of the Third Section, opened the court for interrogation. Because the case involved impersonating a high-ranking official and forging documents, he ordered them to be detained pending transfer to the county government for legal proceedings.</p>

After repeated interrogations, it was determined that Gu Deqin and Gao Da were forced by the bandits to row the boat and their involvement was relatively minor, so they would be dealt with separately. Zhu Sanmao, Fan Youxing, and Chen Ajinmao confessed to the kidnapping and robbery cases of Yao Chang in Qitangtou and Cao Aliuliu in Shengjiawan. They were sentenced to death and the provincial government approved the execution. The execution was carried out by firing squad at the execution ground at 7 AM the day before yesterday after confirming the identities of the convicts.</p>

<p>Four Generations of Township Head's Family Kidnapped: The family of Qu Shangzhen, the head of Changyan Township, Nianbu Bridge, Dongwu District, in this county, was suddenly attacked at 12 o'clock the night before last by more than 40 sea bandits. They landed at Gaopukou and swarmed to the house, first surrounding the residence and then using stone bars to break open the front and back doors. They entered and looted, then kidnapped five members of the household. Township Head Qu Shangzhen, who is 67 years old, was only wearing his upper garment when he was kidnapped. His son, Genfu, who is 35 years old, was bedridden and could not walk, so he was carried away by the bandits. His daughter-in-law, Wang, is 28 years old, his nephew's daughter-in-law, Xia, and his great-nephew, Chunshi, is 8 years old. Only his wife, Xuan, was spared. According to Xuan, the bandits lit candles to illuminate the entire house and were wearing grey clothes, some with copper-rimmed felt hats. They each held box cannons and looted for about an hour, then took the loot and hostages and boarded a boat towards the riverbank. Before leaving, they fired several box cannons. It was also heard that the bandits had first gone to the house of Lu Xincheng, the head of Nianbu Bridge Township, but the occupants escaped after hearing the noise. The bandits only looted valuables and all the family members were safe.</p>

<p>Chamber of Commerce Submits Opinions on Using Business Tax to Offset Likin Abolition: Zhu Danqing, chairman of the preparatory committee of the county chamber of commerce, submitted opinions on using business tax to offset likin abolition to the National Government Executive Yuan and the finance and commerce departments to eliminate future obstacles to the business tax and promote benefits. The original text is very long. The following is an outline: (1) Business license registration can only be implemented after the abolition of likin. (2) Abolish inland regular customs, as they are similar to likin in nature. (3) Abolish all special tax bureaus, as they originally came from the commodity tax. (4) Do not set up inspection agencies to avoid various demands. (5) After the implementation of the business tax, taxes should be levied uniformly according to the amount of capital. Those with capital less than 500 yuan may be exempted to show consideration for small businesses.</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting Cancellation of Fabric Relief Donation: Wu Shouying, chairman of the Jiangyin Fabric Trade Association, stated that in August of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, there were disasters and famines in Jingzhao, Zhili, and Gan provinces. At that time, the former Beijing Ministry of Finance issued an order to add 20% to commodity taxes for relief donations, which were originally scheduled to be abolished in June. At that time, the fabric tax was collected by the tax office. However, when the June deadline passed, it was not stopped and continued year after year, creating an unbearable extra burden. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan, the provincial government, and the Ministry of Finance, requesting them to order the cancellation and submit it to the county council for forwarding to the central government, and to telegraph all counties to unanimously advocate for the relief of business difficulties.</p>
<p>Telegram Urging Wang Jiajin, Wang Guozuo, etc., to Hand Over: Shen Lunxu, director of the Finance Bureau, stated that the handover from the two former county magistrates, Wang Jiajin and Wang Guozuo, had been prepared and sent several times, and letters had been sent to urge them to meet and settle accounts, but they had not yet come to clarify the matter. Now, a special telegram has been sent to the Finance Department to disclose that Wang Jiajin's original residence is Lishui County, and Wang Guozuo's original residence is the Mianshi Street of Ganzhou, Jiangxi. The Wang Jucai of Wang Juyitai shop should be instructed to order the local officials of their original residences to order them to come to Cheng as soon as possible to settle accounts in order to complete the formalities.</p>

<p>The Bandit Case in Pingchao District Expands: Wu Qinmian and Yang Jinyun, bandits captured in Pingchao District, were borrowed from the county court by the county government for investigation and were released. This caused a public outcry. The two bandits, Wu and Yang, have now been captured by the county government. Instructions have been requested from the province for punishment. An emergency meeting was held in Pingchao. A telegram accusing Prosecutor Zhu of the court was sent. The telegram read: "To Court President Bei and Chief Prosecutor Wang Junjian of the Nantong County Court. The Nantong County Court Prosecutor's Office secretly released well-known communist bandits Wu Qinmin and Yang Jinyun this month. The judiciary is dark and the public is indignant. In addition to telegraphed reports to the Provincial Government Security Office and the Civil Affairs Department, we implore you to send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and strict inquiry." The telegrams to the province and other departments were similar and are omitted.</p>
<p>Severely Punish the Illegal County Police Captain: Yan Diannan, the former captain of the Nantong County Police Brigade, was corrupt and lawless during his tenure. After being accused by the people, he was arrested in Bengbu. He is now detained in the Zhenjiang County Prison Detention Center. The province ordered the county to send the evidence in the case for review in order to severely punish him.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Tax Collection at Salt Fields: The collection of taxes from the salt fields in Tongru has always been handled by the field office. Currently, bandits are rampant, and the field police have not yet been formed. Tax collectors are sometimes harmed by bandits. The field chiefs have reported the difficulties to Zhang, the salt commissioner of the Lianghuai Salt Transport Department, who consulted the provincial government and ordered the county magistrates of Tongru to send police to assist.</p>
<p>Deadline to Hand Over Rent Income from Zhang Qian's Confiscated Property: The rent income from Zhang Qian's confiscated property, which has been used by the local government for a considerable amount, has been ordered by the provincial government to be returned to the province by the end of this month.

<p>Details of the Fuyun-Fengyu Steamer Sinking After Being Attacked by Bandits: It is not uncommon for small inland steamers to be robbed by bandits. Although the various steamer companies have repeatedly petitioned the competent authorities to strictly prevent banditry, the bandits are still rampant, and travelers have lost their security and are wary. At 9:30 AM on the 28th, the Fengyu steamer of the Fuyun Steamer Company, towing the Fuan tugboat, departed from Zhenjiang for Baoying. At around 6:00 PM, after passing the Zhaoguan Dam dock for about six or seven li, while proceeding under power, suddenly dozens of bandits were spotted on the shore, firing a volley and ordering the ship to stop. The captain, seeing the ferocity of the bandits, stopped the ship and docked, but the hull had been pierced by a bullet and water poured in, causing the ship to sink immediately. Fortunately, all the passengers were on the tugboat and were not submerged. After boarding the tugboat, the bandits robbed the passengers of their silver, clothing, luggage, and other items, and then fled. In order to protect the safety of passengers, the inland steamer companies had been approved by the competent authorities in June to send police to protect the ships. There were twelve water police officers on board that day, protecting the high officials in the cabins. When the bandits attempted to rob and opened fire, the police officers remained in the cabins and did not resist, and all their guns were confiscated by the bandits. A water police officer from the Sixth District was wounded by a bullet that grazed his mouth and shoulder. He was taken to the provincial hospital in Zhenjiang by another steamer. According to the passengers who were victimized, the injured police officer had inspected the passengers after the ship left Zhenjiang and found a bandit with contraband. The bandit harbored resentment and retaliated later. After the ship passed Zhaoguan Dam for six or seven li, the bandits hiding on the ship fired shots and signaled to the bandits on the shore, firing shots to deter the police on board. A cook named Li Xiaowuzi and a female passenger were killed by the bullets. When the company's Qingjiang steamer heading upstream arrived at the scene, the passengers cried for help. The Qingjiang steamer towed the tugboat to Baoying, and the bodies of those killed by the bandits were sent to the Shaobo Steamer Bureau. Yesterday, after receiving a telephone report, the company sent legal counsel Tao Gongwu and public relations director Tao Shoubo on a special steamer to investigate the truth and report to the Yangzhou court, requesting it to send personnel to examine the bodies. They also reported the incident to the Shipping Association, requesting it to forward the report to the authorities for strict investigation. It is heard that the association telegraphed the Ministry of Communications yesterday after receiving the report.</p>
<p>Appointment of Agricultural Association Reorganization Committee Members in Nine Counties: The Jiangsu Provincial Party Reorganization Committee yesterday appointed members to reorganize the farmers' associations in nine counties, including Kunshan. The list is as follows: (Kunshan) Fang Touxia, Wang Zhenhuan, Yang Qingrong; (Wujiang) Mei Fulin, Zhu Boyi, Wang Liao Wei; (Yixing) Lu Rongquan, Pan Zhisheng, Jiang Maolin; (Qidong) Zhu Chunwan, Zhu Yuxiu, Zhang Xiefeng; (Liyang) Rui Zhenxiang, Jiang Wei, Yang Jiaxiang; (Jiangpu) Li Rongtang, Zhao Shiying, Tang Shiyi; (Taixing) Ji Shaozong, Zhang Yuxiu, Lu Rui; (Taicang) Pu Danan, Zhu Fuli, Lu Zuolin; (Huai'an) Wu Yuren, Liu Xi, Qiao Mosheng.</p>
<p>Qidong County Telegram for Arrest of Former County Magistrate: Xia Yueqing, the former county magistrate of Qidong County, was dismissed from his post due to a case. The Civil Affairs Department had appointed Zhou Lansheng to replace him. However, after receiving the provincial order, County Magistrate Xia knew that his crimes were serious and he would likely be unable to avoid punishment. The day before yesterday, he hired a car and attempted to flee secretly. He was stopped by the public and the police, but he managed to bribe various agencies to release him. The public refused to allow this. In desperation, Xia forcibly ordered the car to leave early on the 24th and fled secretly. Various circles then ordered the police to pursue and detain him, but they were unsuccessful. Yesterday, a public telegram was sent to the provincial government to strictly arrest him and hold him accountable.</p>
<p>The Construction Department Strictly Prohibits Banquets and Empty Formalities: The Construction Department recently announced that banquets and empty formalities by public officials have long been strictly prohibited. However, it has been found that the heads of the construction bureaus in various counties often send invitations to the officials of the department for banquets after completing their official business in the province, in order to establish connections. This inevitably falls into bad habits and uses the wealth of one person to provide food for many. Such meaningless socializing wastes both time and money. Yesterday, a clear order was issued to warn against this.</p>

Many people from the three counties of Shaoxing, Sheng, and Zhuji have joined in the festivities. As a result, bandits from Sheng seized the opportunity to mingle in the crowd. On the morning of the 29th, dozens of bandits armed with wooden-cased guns rose up and robbed the Wangtan Substation, taking five patrol officers and police officers hostage and stealing their weapons. They also kidnapped the owner and shop assistants of the Tao Xing Hao shop and demanded a large ransom. The Public Security Bureau, after hearing the news, has sent a team to pursue them.</p>

<p>Dear Sirs, According to a letter from Yun Daqi, the former Section Chief of the Third Section of the Secretariat of this government, he read in the domestic news section of the Shanghai Shen Bao on October 8 that a telegram from Hong Kong stated that the Guangdong authorities were strictly arresting Yun Daqi and several others. He was very surprised because Daqi has been reading behind closed doors lately and has not been involved in external affairs. Apart from family letters, he has not corresponded with any relatives or friends. He believes that he has not committed any public or private offenses that would warrant the authorities' strict arrest. Therefore, he requests that your government inform the newspaper to make appropriate corrections to clarify the truth. In this regard, this government has not issued such an arrest warrant and the matters presented in the letter are true. Therefore, we specifically request your newspaper to immediately correct the aforementioned telegram. The Guangdong Provincial Government, October 21, 19th year of the Republic of China</p>

<p>Professors' Retention Request</p>
<p>To President Zhang at 816 Hongqing Lane, Wuding Road, Shanghai: With your efforts to improve the school affairs, the entire school is delighted and your grand plans are about to be realized. However, you suddenly developed the intention to resign, going against your original intention and halting the opportunity for improvement. We hope that you will prioritize the school and return to school immediately to preside over the overall plan. National Central University Professors Ni Shangda, Pan Shu, and 60 others, with deep respect.</p>
<p>Two Telegrams from Business School Students</p>
<p>The entire student body of the Business School of National Central University believes that President Zhang's resignation will have a significant impact. After several days of serious consideration, the truth began to dawn, so a general meeting was held yesterday to discuss everything in detail and it was immediately resolved to sincerely urge President Zhang Naiyan to return to school to preside over it. A temporary executive committee was organized on the spot to handle all matters with full authority. It is known that the entire student body of the college has issued two urgent telegrams as follows: (1) A telegram to Chairman Chiang: To Chairman Chiang in Fenghua, After President Zhang Junmou submitted his resignation to Your Excellency, the entire school has been in extreme unease. After reading the newspaper, we learned that someone had been slandering and insulting the entire personality of National Central University in every possible way. President Zhang felt wronged and developed the intention to resign, which will have a profound and significant impact on this school. Please immediately approve President Zhang's return to school to preside over it. The future of National Central University relies on it. The entire student body of the Business School of National Central University, respectfully. (2) A telegram to President Zhang: To President Zhang at 816 Hongqing Lane, Wuding Road, Shanghai. After Your Excellency's lofty departure, the size and scope of the university have been greatly affected, which is not the students' intention. After reading the newspaper, the truth became clear and we deeply hate the slander of the solemn National University. In addition to resolving to make statements to Chairman Chiang and all parties, we especially urge you to immediately dismiss the idea of resignation and return to school to preside over everything. This would be a great blessing for National Central University. The entire student body of the Business School, respectfully.</p>

<p>Chen Shizhen, an advisor to the Ministry of Education, previously requested to be relieved of his concurrent position as Director. On the 9th, the Ministry of Education ordered the advisor to relinquish his concurrent position as Director of the Department of Social Affairs only when Yang Lian arrives at the ministry. The original instruction said, "We have been informed that the advisor has been meticulous in his work since taking office and is deeply respected. Because Director Chen Liu resigned, a successor could not be found for a time, so the advisor was temporarily requested to serve concurrently as the Director of the Department of Social Education, which increased the workload and made him more diligent. Later, Chen repeatedly stated that his health was weak and it was difficult to handle both the advisor and director positions, and his request was sincere. After submitting it to the Executive Yuan for review and submitting it to the National Government, Yang Lian was appointed as the Director of the Department of Social Education of this ministry and the advisor should relinquish the concurrent position of director only after the director arrives at the ministry. We hope that you will continue to persevere and maintain the highest standards."</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education instructed the Jiangsu Education Department to explain the doubts raised by the department regarding the personnel appointment methods for the directors of county-level social education institutions. The instruction read, "We have been informed that the social education institutions mentioned in Order No. 445 of the Ministry of Education, which was issued to the provinces, cities, and counties regarding the appointment and removal methods for principals of secondary schools and directors of social education institutions, refer to those with a larger scale, such as education halls, museums, art galleries, libraries, public stadiums, etc., which are already noted in the parentheses of Article 1. The reading rooms, literacy centers, inquiry centers, and public teahouses mentioned in the report have simple organizations and are small-scale social education institutions and are not included. The appointment and removal of their directors are not subject to the aforementioned methods established by the Ministry. The local educational administrative agencies should establish separate regulations for compliance. The appointment procedures for principals of public schools have been clearly stipulated in Article 13 of the Outline of Public School Methods promulgated by the Ministry. Please comply accordingly."</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Ministry of Education Again Petitions the Central Government to Abolish the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement is a tool for Japan's cultural aggression against China. The Ministry of Education previously listed the inappropriateness of this agreement, drafted a plan to abolish the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement, and submitted it to the Central Government to negotiate with Japan for its abolition. At the same time, it ordered the Chinese members of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Undertakings Foundation Committee to withdraw from the committee, and notified the Supervision Office for Students Studying in Japan to stop subsidizing tuition fees issued by the Japanese Cultural Affairs Bureau in China, to demonstrate its firm opposition to the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement. This stance has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. The contents of the plan to abolish the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement drafted by the Ministry of Education (the contents of the plan are confidential diplomatic documents and will not be published for the time being) are, according to inquiries, roughly divided into two measures: (1) Japan's Boxer Indemnity should be fully returned to China and freely used by China for the development of Sino-Japanese cultural undertakings; (2) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Cultural Affairs Bureau in China should be abolished, and a new organization should be jointly established by China and Japan to handle Sino-Japanese cultural undertakings based on the principle of equality, and the scope of cultural undertakings should be defined, etc. After the Central Political Conference deliberated on the plan, it was submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with Japan. Recently, a reply was received from Japan, completely disagreeing with the first measure of the plan, and only agreeing to change the method of subsidizing tuition fees for Chinese students studying in Japan for the second measure, while insisting on the original terms of the cultural agreement. Yesterday, the Ministry of Education refuted the points of Japan's reply and again stated the impropriety of the agreement's contents, submitting a second petition to the Central Government to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The summary and annotations of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement issued by the Ministry of Education are recorded below: (1) When Japan is conducting cultural affairs in China, it should fully respect the opinions of the representatives of the uneducated classes in China (Article 1). (2) The funds under the Boxer Indemnity shall be mainly used for cultural undertakings run by Chinese people. As for the schools, hospitals, and other cultural undertakings currently operated by Japanese groups in China in Shandong, the subsidy funds shall be specifically drawn from the funds under the Shandong Indemnity. (3) Libraries and institutes of spiritual science shall be established in Beijing, and the land shall be allocated by the Chinese government free of charge. Natural science institutes shall be established in Shanghai, and museums shall be established in suitable locations if there are surplus funds. Medical universities shall be established in Jinan, affiliated with Jinan hospitals. Medical schools and affiliated hospitals shall be established in Guangdong (Articles 3, 4, 5, 6, 8). (4) Each of the aforementioned undertakings shall establish a council composed of Chinese and Japanese people, with approximately twenty members for each council, ten from each side, and an additional Chinese person selected through consultation between the two sides as the chairman (Article 7). (5) From the following year (fixed for ten years), tuition fees shall be granted to Chinese students studying in Japan according to the following methods: (A) 80 yuan per person per month; (B) Not exceeding 320 people; (C) The number shall be allocated to each province based on the number of representatives in the provincial assembly and the amount of Boxer Indemnity borne by each province, and selected from students studying at universities and specialized schools; these universities and specialized schools shall be designated through consultation between the Chinese ambassador to Japan and the Japanese Ministry of Education and the Cultural Affairs Bureau in China; (D) The selection of students shall not be limited to government-funded students, and self-funded students shall also be included; (E) Students who have already been selected may have their tuition fees stopped at any time if they are deemed to have poor academic performance or bad conduct (Draft Article 10, deleted and revised when formally signed). From the above agreement, it can be generally seen that the so-called handling of Chinese cultural undertakings is under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Cultural Affairs Bureau in China and is a part of Japan's internal affairs. The tuition subsidies for Chinese students studying in Japan within Japan are directly under the command of the Cultural Affairs Bureau in China, and are handled by the Chinese institutions managing students studying in Japan. Within China, cultural and charitable undertakings are handled by people dispatched by the Japanese government and entrusted to people dispatched by the Chinese government to assist in the handling, and the undertakings carried out within China can obtain the ownership of Chinese land. The so-called return of the Boxer Indemnity is actually the designation by the Japanese government accounting for certain revenue for certain internal affairs purposes, which is nothing more than cultural aggression against China.</p>

<p>First Revision of Rule 4 Add the following note: "An area can be designated on both sides of the free throw area line to assist in placing dual players during free throws. This area should be marked with the words 'Home' and 'Guest' to indicate the position that players from the home and visiting teams should take." (As shown in the figure, draw a short line five feet inside from the end line and write the words on the ground. One player from the home team and one player from the visiting team stand in this area. The remaining players stand alternately based on these two players, with the guest team next to the home team and the home team next to the guest team, so that the forces on both sides are balanced to avoid mutual competition for position. However, this is only a suggestion and is not required by the rules.)</p>
<p>Rule 1 of Article 4 The circumference of the ball shall be changed from 30 to 32 inches to 30 to 21 inches. The weight of the ball shall be changed from 20 to 23 ounces to 20 to 22 ounces.</p>
<p>Rule 3 of Article 5 Add "A player who is replaced by another player shall not immediately enter the game as a substitute before the game is temporarily suspended and restarted." (That is, if a player has been formally replaced and the game has not yet restarted, but suddenly wants to rejoin and replace another player, the recorder and referee may refuse the substitution. However, if the game has proceeded as usual after the substitution, even if it is only for a short time, and the player re-enters the field as a substitute to replace another player, it is still qualified.)</p>
<p>Rule 6 of Article 5 Add the phrase "or combined numbers that are easy to confuse viewers" after the note. (The ball number itself had a suggestion to avoid the numbers "1" and "2," but combined numbers are quite inconvenient for the referee to inspect and announce, hence this move.)</p>
<p>Rule 3 of Article 7 Add the following note: "If a player holding the ball near the boundary line is defended by an opponent within one yard and cannot attack, and holds the ball for more than five seconds, the referee may declare a 'jump ball.'" (If a player is forced into a corner and has no chance to turn or pass the ball, and holds the ball to wait for more than five seconds, the referee can declare a jump ball even if the opponent's hand has not touched the ball, in order to avoid wasting time. However, it should be noted that this rule only applies to situations where the player only has one side that can move and is blocked by the opponent. If it is in the middle of the field, both sides have opportunities to move, and this rule is not applicable.)</p>
<p>Rule 6 of Article 8 Revise the number of dribbles to "During a jump ball, the jumper may dribble the ball twice, but not more than two times. The second dribble does not necessarily have to be within the circle, it can also be outside the circle. After the second dribble, the jumper should not touch the ball until the ball has touched the other eight players, or the floor, or the basket, or the backboard." (According to the old rules, the number of dribbles was not clearly specified, and it had to be dribbled within the circle to make the ball dribble out of the circle. This rule allows the player to dribble out of the circle or dribble once again while still in the circle, which is more active than before.)</p>
<p>Rule 3 of Article 9 Add the following note: "In competitions for junior high or younger children, if the score is still tied after the first overtime period and it is necessary to extend the game again, there must be a five-minute rest period, and the players may leave the field during this rest period. However, the number of times of leaving the field during overtime is limited to three. During the second and third times, a one-minute rest period is still allowed, and they may not leave the field." (If the game is still tied at the end of the second overtime period, the coaches and captains of both sides should first agree on a method so that even if the score is equal in the third overtime period, a winner can be determined. The common method is to declare the team that first scores two points in the third overtime period as the winner, but each competent authority can stipulate it according to its own suitability. As for the case where the scores of both sides are obviously high after the third overtime, the winner is naturally judged based on the number of points, and it is no longer necessary to use the standard of first scoring two points.)</p>
<p>Rule 1 of Article 10 Add a referee note as follows: "The official's judgment on the ball going out of bounds should be very clear so that both sides do not misunderstand. If a misunderstanding unfortunately occurs, the official should take the ball in hand until both sides have the opportunity to restore their offensive and defensive positions, and then hand it over to the thrower. However, the official does not need to personally hand the ball to the thrower every time the ball goes out of bounds."</p>
<p>Rule 1 of Article 11 In the case of an infringement foul, the "time-out" should last from the time the foul occurs until the ball leaves the hand of the free thrower. If there are two or more consecutive free throws, then it should last until the last time the ball leaves the hand. Technical fouls and double fouls still last from the time the foul occurs until the jump ball in the center circle.</p>
<p>Rule 6 of Article 13 Delete the last sentence of the first paragraph of this rule to conform to the changes in the penalty for throwing the ball out of bounds.</p>
<p>Penalty for Rule 7 of Article 14 Revise to "If a free throw is awarded due to a technical foul, the free throw shall be taken in the center circle instead of at the nearest free throw line if the thrower steps out of the free throw line or his teammate enters the free throw area before the ball touches the basket or the backboard." (Because the success or failure of throwing the ball after a technical foul must be a jump ball in the center circle, it would contradict the ordinary free throw rules if the jump ball were still held on the free throw line according to the old rules, hence this revision.)</p>
<p>Rule 8 of Article 14 Add the following note: "Kicking the ball must be intentional to be punished. Unintentional clearing of the ball with the legs or feet is not a violation." (It is not easy to judge whether the kicking of the ball is intentional or unintentional, but the official's judgment based on the situation is better than not asking the reason and only regarding the contact between the ball and the leg as a violation, which would cause unnecessary obstacles to the game.) Subsection E of Rule 1 of Article 15 If a jumper leaves the circle before dribbling the ball during a jump ball, the penalty is changed from a violation to a technical foul, but if the ball is properly dribbled into its own basket in the circle by another jumper at this time, the ball is still valid, and the offender can be ignored. (Do not damage the interests already obtained by the non-offending party due to the foul, and consider the ball invalid and stuck in the free throw.)</p>
<p>Penalty for Infringement Foul in Article 15 If an infringement foul occurs while throwing the ball into the basket and the ball still hits the basket, add one free throw; if the ball fails to hit the basket as a result, award two free throws; if the second ball fails to hit the basket during the continuation of the game after the first free throw fails, continue the game (According to last year's revision, if a foul occurred and the ball still did not hit the basket, two free throws were awarded, but the jump ball in the center circle for whether the second ball hit or did not hit contradicted the ordinary free throw rules. This method is now revised to conform to the free throw rules. If one free throw fails, it is possible to score four consecutive points if one goal is scored to continue the game, which is still equal in value to the previous two free throws and is more fair than the two free throws that can stably score four points.)</p>

As for the Western Football Club, it will also provide spiritual cooperation and does not object to the review plan. It is not yet convenient to announce what it looks like.</p>

<p>Collection of Proposals from Various Parties</p>
<p>The Business and Industry Conference convened by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is scheduled to open in Beijing on the 1st. Many members from Shanghai have been invited and are departing for Beijing today to attend. Listed below are the members who left for Beijing yesterday: Minister of Industry and Commerce Kong Xiangxi, Director Zhao Puqing, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Lin Kanghou, Standing Committee members Chen Riping, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Wang Xiaolai, Standing Committee members Wang Yansong, Ye Huijun, Executive Committee member Fang Jiaobo, Ye Fuxiao of the Continental Bank, Chen Zeqing, manager of the Four Banks Joint Treasury and president of Minghua Bank, Li Fusun, general manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhang Gongquan, president of the Bank of China, Chen Guangfu, general manager of Shanghai Bank, Hu Mengjia, manager of the Bank of Communications, Huang Jinschen, chairman of the General Association of Silk Cocoon Producers of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, accountants Pan Xulun and Xu Yongzuo, President of Tongji University Hu Shuhua, Lao Jingxiu, director of Nanyang Tobacco Company, Zhang Zilian, general manager of Wangxing Cotton Mill, Yuan Duanfu, chairman of Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, Zheng Shouzhi, managing director of Jiangnan Paper Mill, Hu Bijiang, manager of Zhongnan Bank, Rong Zongjing, general manager of Shenxin Textile Mill, Wu Yunzhai, general manager of Jincheng Bank, Liu Hongsheng, general manager of China Cement Company, Zhu Mouxian, manager of Weicheng Company, Cai Shengbai, general manager of Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Shao Jinqing, manager of Zhenhua Oil Paint Company, Lu Bohong, manager of China Electric Tram Company, Gu Xinyi of Huada Bank, Yang Xingfo, vice president of the Academia Sinica, and Wang Yiting, Wang Binyan, Qian Chengxu, Dai Ailu, Wu Yunshu, Ma Yinchu, Xiao Lizhai, Zhong Weicheng, Li Quanshi, Huang Zhangan, Liu Wanqing, Li Jinghan, Cai Zhengzhi, Yang Rumei, Shi Bo'an, Lu Chengzhang, Ren Sida, and others. The Shanghai Investigation Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce contacted the railway bureau yesterday to add dozens of sleeper berths to the evening train. It is said that the Industry and Commerce Conference will have people at the station to greet them upon arrival in Beijing. The proposals from various parties are listed below:</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan: Representative of the Municipal Government and Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Pan Gongzhan, will report to Beijing today. The titles of the proposals he is submitting this time have been published in newspapers. It has been learned that the most important proposal is the "Motion for Unified Observance by All Industries of Regulations Approved by Competent Authorities" (Reason): It is found that if industry regulations formulated by industry associations and approved by competent authorities cannot be enforced on non-members, cunning individuals can arbitrarily expand their private interests, while members who join the association only have the obligation to bear the burdens without a common code of conduct, leading to regret and attempts to withdraw. This will make the association equivalent to a mere formality. (Measures): (1) The industry regulations formulated by each industry must be submitted to the local administrative authorities in charge of industry and commerce for approval and record. (2) Once approved and recorded, they will be regarded as industry regulations to be jointly observed. Whether a member or non-member, those who violate them may be reported to the authorities for investigation. (3) When the industry regulations encounter obstacles in practice, the authorities may add or delete them. There is also a "Motion to Promote Labor-Capital Cooperation" (Reason): Recently, all industries and businesses in Shanghai have suffered from the economic invasion of imperialists and the impact of labor-capital disputes, leading to successive bankruptcies. If no remedies are taken, the number of unemployed workers will inevitably increase. Our Party originally takes the protection of labor as one of its political programs. How can we sit idly by? Capital is apprehensive of the soaring costs and fearful of the surging labor unrest, making it impossible to maintain operations. If the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to? If we want to protect workers, we must first start with rescuing industries. (Measures): Each factory shall use profits to conduct labor welfare programs, and the government shall levy net profit taxes to allocate funds for local labor welfare programs. The measures are proposed as follows: (1) Stipulate minimum wages. (2) Stipulate the percentage of worker bonuses to encourage them. (3) Levy net profit taxes, stipulating progressive levels based on the amount, to conduct labor welfare programs and promote labor-capital cooperation. (4) Organize a local labor welfare program committee to preside over everything. Its members will be jointly appointed by Party and government agencies and representatives of both labor and capital. (5) Conduct labor welfare programs such as schools, hospitals, insurance, loans, dormitories, housing, pensions, unemployment insurance, unemployment subsidies, wage subsidies, etc. Other proposals include the "Motion to Encourage Private Basic Industries," "Motion to Rescue Key Industries such as Silk, Tea, Matches, Flour, Cigarettes, and Silk Weaving," and "Motion to Truly Use Domestic Goods." The reasons and measures for these proposals are lengthy and cannot be fully described. It is also heard that these proposals have been submitted to the Municipal Government for review and referral to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and will be submitted to the conference at that time.</p>
<p>Xu Peihuang: The newly appointed Director of the Education Bureau of this city, Xu Peihuang, has submitted several important proposals to the conference for inclusion on the agenda. The original text is very long. It has been learned that the content is as follows: (1) Request the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to announce to all industries and businesses nationwide to list and report in detail the problems in their respective industries, which the ministry will collect and study to separately resolve or improve, so that all industries and businesses have hope of recovery. (2) Limit foreign merchants from establishing factories in China to prevent foreign goods and semi-foreign goods from occupying the market and hindering the development of domestic factories. (3) Establish industrial and commercial management personnel training institutes to improve and enhance the intelligence of management personnel, and propose both short-term and long-term plans. (4) Request the establishment of industrial product standards in accordance with European and American methods, so that each manufacturer can specialize in their industry and avoid unnecessary waste.</p>
<p>Qian Chengxu: Qian Chengxu, a member of the Industry and Commerce Conference, proposed a "Motion to Request the Government to Promulgate Industrial Protection Laws as Soon as Possible to Benefit People's Livelihood and Emphasize Production." Under the current circumstances, China's industry is facing extreme difficulties. To realize the industrial policy laid down by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, this conference can base on the legislative procedures promulgated by the Legislative Yuan to first discuss the scope. Once the principles are determined, the fundamental law of national industrial protection in the future can be generated accordingly, and all obstacles can be eliminated. In the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China," private enterprises are stipulated to be encouraged by the state and laws are formulated to protect them. Eight principles are hereby proposed for discussion at the conference to determine whether they are appropriate for decision-making. (1) For all industries that have reached the level of foreign trade, the government should encourage their exports and exempt them from the burden of raw material taxes. (2) For foreign goods that have the nature of hoarding, the government should restrict their imports by law. (3) For Chinese and foreign merchants who operate industries and businesses in China with capital, the government should protect Chinese merchants or guarantee that they receive the same treatment as foreign merchants at a minimum. (4) For foreign manufacturers who operate industries and businesses in China, the government should order them to register with Chinese authorities. (5) For those who operate factories, the government should order local competent authorities to effectively protect the management rights of the factory in accordance with the law. (6) For those who operate financial institutions and whose business has developed to a certain extent, the government should order them to invest in certain industries. (7) For those who operate factories, the government may order them to rectify and improve all their internal operations and equipment to conform to the principles of scientific management. (8) For those who operate factories with capital and whose products are no longer needed in the market, or who deliberately lower prices in the market to compete, and whose purpose is to monopolize the future market, the government should adopt intervention policies.</p>
<p>Machine-Made Goods Association: The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Association sent a telegram to the Industry and Commerce Conference: "To the Secretariat of the Nanjing Industry and Commerce Conference, for the public review of all members: This Industry and Commerce Conference is aimed at promoting benefits and eliminating ills, covering all aspects. The reason why our national goods cannot develop is that the tax rates on national goods and foreign goods are not equal. Taking the national cotton cloth, which is a daily necessity for the people, as an example, each bolt of national cloth pays 1.333 taels of tax (likin excluded), while each bolt of foreign cloth pays 0.21 taels of tax. For national cloth of the same weight (less than 10 taels), each bolt pays 1.122 taels more tax than foreign goods. At a time when the government is advocating national goods, national goods are obviously being ostracized by foreign goods, making it difficult to develop. What should be done to remedy this? Please pay special attention to this matter. Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Association."</p>

<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs Requested Further Review on the Issue of Whether Industry Regulations Should Be Observed. The matter has recently attracted considerable attention. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently made a submission to the Bureau of Social Affairs, which the Bureau has forwarded to the Municipal Government. The submission reads as follows: "Submission Regarding the Request for Instructions. We have received Your Honor's Instruction No. 5624 (omitted in the middle). We have ordered the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify them. The Chamber of Commerce has submitted that if the competent authorities are responsible for handling industrial and commercial matters within their jurisdiction, it is their exclusive responsibility. If the industry regulations requested for filing by each industry contain provisions that are deemed to involve monopolies or violate good customs, it would be difficult to lightly approve them. Historically, cases of rejection can be investigated. The Ministry's order states that even if they are filed, it is still difficult to guarantee that there will be no malpractices. It seems unlikely that the authorities would handle matters so lightly. It also states that such bad regulations are difficult to protect even if they are brought to court. If this statement is followed, even if the members who have joined the association seek relief by appealing to the law because they do not comply with the regulations agreed upon by the public, they will lose their protection. We are afraid that once this order is disseminated, all regulations will not only be insufficient to bind non-members, but also insufficient to bind members who have joined the association. From then on, the association will no longer have any binding force. How can we expect it to seek public interest for the industry? Furthermore, the state's permission to establish industry associations clearly recognizes them as maintaining public interests and correcting business malpractices. Now, the regulations submitted by each association for approval are denounced as 'often containing monopolistic nature or violating good customs.' It is as if the establishment of the association is no different from creating a mechanism for industry monopoly. If what is said is true, wouldn't the merchants have cases of accusation and the authorities have grounds for dissolution? We believe that what the Ministry emphasizes is nothing more than that the regulations do not conform to good customs and the authorities have not been able to examine them in detail. Therefore, even if they are filed, it is still difficult to guarantee that there will be no malpractices. This should have been clearly stated by the competent authorities without the need for the association to elaborate. However, since the Ministry's order states that the competent authorities should still refer to good commercial customs to carefully review the regulations established by each industry in order to reduce disputes, and also states that regardless of the content of the regulations, those approved by the authorities, whether or not they have joined the association, must comply. Not only will it not help, but it will also cause disputes. If the content of the regulations does not violate good commercial customs, and has been solemnly decided by the industry in advance and carefully approved by the authorities, the situation is no different from being a recognized business practice in the industry. If the scope of implementation is limited to members who have joined the association, those who have not joined will take advantage of their private interests, and those who have joined will withdraw one after another. The various associations will either be in the form of disintegration or will exist in name only and lose their effectiveness. This is a detailed study of the business situation and the experience gained, and it is not empty talk. Business customs of an industry are within the scope of not conflicting with commercial laws and regulations, and there is a supplementary legal effect. The regulations decided and filed are actually the written commercial customs. In terms of the general rule of supplementing laws and regulations with customs, it cannot be said that there is no mandatory effect. It is a matter of fact that it is necessary to order non-members to comply with the regulations, and it is not without basis in law. It is appropriate to prepare a document and request for review. We respectfully request your decision. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Zhang."</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submitted a Request to Maintain the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Request That Non-Member Industries Should Comply With the Regulations, and Resubmitted the Request to the Bureau of Social Affairs. "Submission Regarding the Fact That the Regulations Are Important to Each Industry Association, and the Public Lost Their Minds After Receiving the Ministry's Rejection. They Gathered to Discuss and Request for Maintenance, and Submitted the Situation to Request Your Honor to Review and Approve. We Request the Municipal Government to Resubmit to the Executive Yuan to Order the Ministry to Re-Examine the Matters. On the 29th of this month, we received a joint letter from the Southern Goods Industry, Intestine Industry, Egg Industry, Silk Industry, Northern and Southern Goods Exchange Industry, Fruit and Local Goods Industry, Soy Sauce Garden Industry, Chinese Medicine Industry, Medicinal Material Industry, Chinese Woolen Factory Industry, Transportation Industry, Chinese Soap Industry, Chicken and Duck Industry, and the Eighty-Fourth Industry Association, requesting the Association to Submit Approved Regulations for Re-Examination so That They Can Be Followed, etc. (The original text is omitted). It was found that this case was first submitted by Your Bureau to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to the Executive Yuan. It is believed that in this case, the Ministry failed to thoroughly understand the commercial situation. Once implemented, it is feared that each association will inevitably disintegrate as a result. We have explained the reasons in detail and requested to resubmit to the Executive Yuan for the Ministry to re-examine. The approval for review has been received. However, no clear text has been seen to be submitted to the Ministry for re-examination for many days. This time, each industry association appointed tax coupon recognition, which is based on the fact that non-member industries are not bound by the association and cannot recognize it. The member industries also found it extremely difficult to handle the situation because the obligations were too skewed. They repeatedly asked the association for instructions and refused to handle the matter. All of these situations show that the division between member and non-member industries makes it difficult to handle the various facts. The only way to remedy this is to allow the regulations to be complied with uniformly, so that it can be maintained to a slight extent. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is in charge of the whole country and cannot deeply understand the hardships. This time, each association has come to us with letters stating that their reasons are in line with the previous submissions of the affiliated associations. Since the associations have entrusted their intentions, it is not appropriate to suppress them. We will prepare a document stating the situation and requesting Your Bureau to review and forward it. It is truly a convenience for the public."</p>
<p>The Second Meeting of the Regulations Protection Committee: The Industry Association Regulations Protection Committee of this city held its second committee meeting yesterday. Chairman Luo Qinghua resolved the following motions: (1) A letter from the Hat Association requesting the authorities to amend the motion that all industries in a region must join the industry association was discussed and a reply was sent. (2) A motion to have the committee members hold a face-to-face meeting with Chairman Jiang when he passes through Shanghai to appeal for the maintenance of the regulations was approved. (3) A motion to submit a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to allow the committee to send members to participate in the Industry and Commerce Conference so that they can raise the issue of regulations was discussed and a telegram was sent to the chairman of the Industry and Commerce Conference and Mr. Wang Yansong was requested to urge the representatives to strive for this. (4) A motion to send representatives to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and the National Government to petition for protection was approved. The meeting was adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<p>Important Remarks by Wang Yansong: The various industry associations in this city believe that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's discussion and rejection of the regulations is a major issue and will inevitably render the various industry associations merely formal. They convened a joint meeting of representatives of various industries some days ago and resolved to organize an Industry Association Regulations Protection Committee to handle the matter exclusively. Yesterday, the committee held its second committee meeting to discuss the direction of progress. After the meeting, it was learned that the Bureau of Social Affairs of this city had submitted a proposal to the Industry and Commerce Conference on the issue. It was also learned that Mr. Wang Yansong, a standing committee member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and a member of the Industry and Commerce Conference, was very concerned about the situation of the various industries. He then organized a team to meet with Mr. Wang Yansong to request assistance. Mr. Wang Yansong met with the committee members of the association and stated that the use of regulations is to correct business malpractices and promote public interests. Unfavorable habits such as shoddy workmanship and materials, counterfeit goods, and disturbing market prices are all eliminated by the constraints of regulations, and the morality and credit of commerce can also be mutually improved. However, such regulations must be observed by both member and non-member industries to be effective. Otherwise, those who join the association must fulfill all social obligations and be bound by the regulations. Why not allow those who have not joined the association to be free and do whatever they want? Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is also very concerned about this. After the Ministry of Industry and Commerce discussed and rejected the regulations, it explained the reasons and requested a review. Now that the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has submitted a proposal to the Industry and Commerce Conference, I, as a member of the conference, will certainly strive for it at that time. Fortunately, the gentlemen who are discussing the issue at the Industry and Commerce Conference are all from the business community and have a wealth of experience. I believe they will have extremely perfect opinions to contribute to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for adoption. After saying this, the committee members left with excitement.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Meiya Silk Factory Fashion Exhibition <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Grand Occasion Held at the Great China Hotel Yesterday</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang and Others Attended to Deliver Speeches</p>
<p>The Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, founded entirely by Chinese people, was established in the ninth year of the Republic of China. This year marks its tenth anniversary. Its products are of excellent quality and its business is thriving. General Manager Mr. Cai Sheng-bai has planned effectively, resulting in continuous improvement of the organization and increasing product innovation. It now has fourteen branch factories, supplying goods to Europe, America, Southeast Asia, India, and China. It is truly a pioneer of domestic silk factories. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., the Tenth Anniversary Fashion Exhibition was held at the Great China Hotel. The atmosphere was filled with the fragrance of clothing and hair ornaments, and the rustling of skirts and shoes. The event was extremely grand. Approximately 2,000 guests attended from all sectors, including political, military, business, academic circles, and prominent ladies. Shanghai Mayor Zhang Yuejun stayed from the beginning of the opening ceremony until the end of the event, and personally delivered a speech. The grand occasion of yesterday is recorded in detail below:</p>
<p>Attending Guests: Shanghai Mayor Zhang Yuejun and his wife, Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and his wife, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Pan Gongzhan and his wife, Representative of Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Zhao Jinqing, Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Member Fan Zhengbo and his wife, Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting and his wife, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Shanghai Office Liu Yunfang and his wife, President of the Jiangsu Higher Second Court Xu Weizhen and his wife, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce members, owner of the Jinda New Silk Fabric Bureau Wang Yansong and his wife, as well as various bureau chiefs of the Municipal Government and prominent ladies Guo Anzi, Yu Xiuyun, and others; movie stars Hu Die, Yan Yuexian, and others. In total, there were over 2,000 guests from all sectors. There was no empty seat in the venue, and those who arrived late to purchase tickets were unable to enter due to the lack of space, with about 700 people being forced to turn back.</p>
<p>Venue Decoration: All decorations in the venue were undertaken by the Meiyi Architectural Firm, based on designs by a French-educated artist, Mr. [Blank Space]. The decorations were all very modern in style. At the entrance, there was a colorful archway, and more than forty brocade screens were displayed, all showcasing the factory's printed and plain-colored high-quality silks in very delicate colors. In the center of the dance hall, a round platform was built, with a pond in the center from which a large silk umbrella lamp emerged. To the right of the round platform, a long bridge led to the entrance for the fashion show performers. All around were seats for the guests. During the opening ceremony, speeches, reports, and music were broadcast throughout the venue using extremely large Telefunken speakers installed by Siemens, ensuring orderly proceedings and excellent results.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: The ceremony began at approximately 4 p.m. After singing the national anthem and performing customary salutations, General Manager Cai of the factory delivered the opening speech. This was followed by speeches from Mayor Zhang, Director Zhao representing Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau, and others. The fashion show then began, interspersed with tea dances and entertainment. Finally, a film produced by the factory itself, titled "Chinese Silk," was screened. It described the earliest invention of Chinese silk weaving and lamented the lack of improvement due to adherence to old methods, which prevented it from competing with Europe and America. It depicted the ancient and modern methods of silkworm farming, silk reeling, and silk weaving, as well as the operations of the Meiya factory. The music began to play as the film ended, and the meeting adjourned at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Opening Speech: General Manager Cai's opening speech stated, in brief: "Today, we celebrate the tenth anniversary of our factory and invite guests from all walks of life to attend and provide guidance. We are deeply honored and grateful. When our factory was founded ten years ago, our capital was limited and our scale was small. However, with the guidance of various sectors and the enthusiastic promotion of domestic products, we have been able to gradually develop. The purpose of today's fashion exhibition is not to boast about our products, but to earnestly seek guidance from all sectors. We hope you will forgive any inadequacies or discourtesies in today's reception."</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech: Shanghai Mayor Zhang Yuejun delivered a speech stating, in brief: "Promoting domestic products requires attention to four aspects: 1. The quantity of domestic products; 2. The quality of domestic products; 3. The compatibility of domestic products with national conditions; 4. The business ethics of domestic products. The products of Meiya Factory are large in quantity, excellent in quality, suitable for national conditions, and beneficial to national productivity. Furthermore, they pay great attention to business ethics. Their future is immeasurable. I am very pleased to participate in this event and wish Meiya Factory to be a vital force in the domestic products industry, with even greater development in the future."</p>

<p>Mr. Zhao's Speech: Zhao Jinqing, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, delivered a speech stating, in brief: "Today, Minister Kong has entrusted me to deliver a speech on his behalf. I feel that in these times of poverty and financial difficulty, everyone lacks food because industry and commerce are declining and production is too weak. Even in the silk industry, the situation is not as good as it used to be. However, today's event can give us a lesson: Meiya Factory has achieved this good result through ten years of effort. If all domestic products could be like this, then the development of national industry and commerce could be achieved quickly, and the hardship of the people's livelihood could be alleviated. I hope that Meiya Silk Factory will continue to make progress and be a model for the effort of domestic industrial and commercial enterprises."</p>
<p>Mr. Pan's Speech: Director Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau delivered a speech stating, in brief: "Promoting domestic products is no longer a time for talk but a time for action. To promote domestic products, the people only need to fulfill their responsibilities and purchase domestic products as much as possible within their capabilities, and domestic products will naturally develop. The history of Meiya Factory is only ten years, but its efforts have achieved remarkable results in production. Therefore, consumption must also be the same. I believe that with our large population, we can become rich and strong simply by being self-sufficient, and there is no need to make the export of domestic products a major benefit. However, the decline of the silk industry abroad may not be a bad phenomenon. If our people can work hard to promote domestic silk products, and the raw materials are from ourselves and used by ourselves, why worry about the lack of sales? Therefore, the future of Meiya Factory is very promising. After another ten years, its development will be even greater than it is now."</p>
<p>Fashion Show: The fashion show featured a total of twenty-four outfits modeled by several Chinese and Western ladies. They emerged from the dressing room, walked slowly and gracefully across the long bridge, and stepped onto the round platform. They turned around once to the accompaniment of beautiful music, and then retreated gracefully. The scene was particularly charming and eye-catching under the red lights, and the overall effect was magnificent. The show was divided into three acts. The first act was dedicated to morning wear: 1. Sleepwear; 2. Underwear; 3. Lounge wear. The second act was dedicated to general daytime wear: 1. Garden party wear; 2. Outerwear; 3. Tennis wear; 4. Tea dance wear. The third act was dedicated to evening wear: 1. Evening dress; 2. Evening gown.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Inauguration Ceremony of Chen Qimei Memorial Tower Scheduled <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Chen Qimei Memorial Tower, built at the Fangbang Bridge in the West Gate of this city, has been under construction for almost six months. The entire tower project has now been completed, and the inauguration ceremony is scheduled for the 3rd of next month. The tower preparation office has also sent invitations to various military and political institutions in this city to attend the ceremony and has built a guest platform surrounded by bamboo fences for rest. The tower is eighty feet high and contains an iron ladder leading to the top. The front faces east, and the following inscription is engraved in large seal script on the marble base: "Memorial Tower of Mr. Chen Qimei." A door in the back wall provides access. On both sides are engraved the "Memorial Tower Inscription of Mr. Chen Qimei." A round vessel tops the tower, rising majestically into the clouds, creating a solemn atmosphere. The inscription is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Memorial Tower Inscription of Mr. Chen Qimei) Mr. Chen's given name was Qimei, a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang. During the recovery of Shanghai in the Xinhai Revolution, he was elected as the Shanghai Governor. He met with the armies of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Guangdong, and Guangxi to capture Nanjing, welcomed the Prime Minister at sea, and established the Republic of China. When Hongxian declared himself emperor, he planned to rise up in the southeast to restore the Republic. On May 18th of the fifth year, he was assassinated in Shanghai at the age of thirty-nine. His wife, Yao, and orphan, Zu Zuhe, waited until it had been fourteen years since Mr. Chen's death when his old friends Huang Fu of Hangzhou, Jiang Zhongzheng of Fenghua, and Zhang Qun of Huayang were finally able to fulfill the wishes of the people of Shanghai and requested land to erect a tower for Mr. Chen. Alas, Mr. Chen's painstaking efforts in the early stages of the revolution, his selfless courage in the face of difficulties, and his dedication to the cause until its success are all recorded in the national history and should be as long-lasting as the Republic of China, enduring for all time and never being replaced. This cannot be fully recorded by a mere corner of land or a single stone. Only the people of Shanghai cannot remain silent. Recalling that nineteen years ago, Shanghai, a small place, was tied to the success or failure of each province, and Mr. Chen, as an individual, determined the safety of Shanghai. Transportation converged here, finances were provided, military affairs were prepared, and public opinion was gathered. On the night of November 3rd of the Xinhai year, the people's army attacked the Shanghai Southern Manufacturing Bureau without success. Mr. Chen said, "I will use righteousness to inform them so that they will surrender without fighting and avoid harming their compatriots and alarming the people." He rushed in alone, and although he was captured, he eloquently spoke of the necessity of reforming the government and the urgency of the revolution. When the city was captured, Mr. Chen, with his hands in iron chains, came out and said, "Aren't the comrades suffering enough?" His demeanor was solemn. Alas, is this not what is meant by forgetting oneself in the face of danger and not yielding when faced with righteousness? In governing the army, Mr. Chen shared the joys and hardships with his soldiers. In governing the government, he advocated thrift to cultivate integrity. In his residence, the house had only two pillars, and all the instruments in the Governor's mansion were simple. Mr. Chen said, "The disease of a weak country is deep-rooted. If we want to revitalize the spirit of the people, we must rectify the declining customs. Shanghai is a bustling area where the rich and poor are vastly different. Using military force is only a last resort to remove the old and bring in the new. How can we bear to see this brief moment become the final path to light? Why suddenly indulge in trivial matters and open up endless evil examples?" Alas, Mr. Chen can be said to have possessed the virtues of benevolence, courage, integrity, and modesty. Mr. Chen pioneered the Shanghai city, initiated the demolition of the city walls, and today the towering thoroughfares and densely packed residences were created by Mr. Chen. Now, a tower is erected to promote his achievements and to ride on immortality. Is this not appropriate? The foundation of the tower was laid on May 18th of the 19th year of the Republic of China, marking the day of Mr. Chen's death. It was completed on November 3rd of the same year, not forgetting Mr. Chen's contribution to the recovery of Shanghai. The funds were donated by private individuals, following Mr. Chen's intention of cherishing public funds. So that those who view it in the future may have a place to admire and admire. It is tied with a song, saying: "Alas, Mr. Chen's life was filled with worries and toil; Mr. Chen's death made his name immortal. Knowing that his heroic spirit loves this land, may his soul forever encircle the city of Shanghai. May the country of China be glorious and prosperous, and may the people of China be peaceful and happy. May this comfort his spirit, which will never perish in heaven and earth."</p>
<h3 id="e133">Cotton Textile Industry Delegation to Beijing to Participate in Exhibition <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The domestic cotton textile factories of this city participating in the cotton textile exhibition initiated by the National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce sent representatives to Beijing on the 7:05 a.m. train yesterday (the 30th). Representatives from the Shanghai Collection Office, Sun Choucheng and Chen Tianren, and others sent personnel to set up a meeting point for the representatives outside the platform at 6:00 a.m. Representatives from various factories arrived one after another. Sun Choucheng publicly reported on the storage of luggage and the situation of entering the city after arriving in Beijing, and then led the team to board the train. The train was specially chartered and hung with a white bamboo cloth banner that read "Shanghai Domestic Goods Factories Participating in the Cotton Textile Exhibition Delegation." Various groups such as the Shanghai Domestic Goods Factories Federation sent personnel to wave flags and see them off, which was quite a grand occasion. It is reported that there were more than fifty factories and eighty people participating this time.</p>
<h3 id="e134">National Products Association Prepares for Exhibition in Suzhou <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Last autumn, the China National Products Maintenance Association and the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products led the Shanghai National Products Traveling Exhibition Group to Suzhou to hold a mobile exhibition for three weeks. The total business volume was more than 283,000 yuan. Now, public groups such as the Suzhou General Chamber of Commerce, the YMCA, and the Silk Relief Association have jointly requested the Shanghai National Products Traveling Exhibition Group to re-exhibit in Suzhou to open up Guanqian Street, revitalize the market, and develop commerce. The two associations jointly elected Wang Jiean, Chen Yiting, and Shen Shuyu as three representatives to go to Suzhou to discuss everything. They returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday and decided to convene a general meeting of representatives of all Shanghai industrial and commercial factories at Gaodun Road tomorrow (the 1st) at 3:00 p.m. to report on the negotiation process and discuss the organization of the exhibition. It is reported that there are forty shops for the exhibition, and factories wishing to join can register at the exhibition preparation office (located in the National Products Maintenance Association) as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Ministry of Railways Tightens Control of Railway Funds <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Circular Issued to Two Railway Bureaus for Compliance</p>
<p>Minister of Railways Sun Ke recently stated that although the income from passenger and freight transport on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway this year has increased significantly compared to last year, the rising gold price has affected the payment of interest on loans from silver companies. The principal and interest due for the first half of the year have not yet been repaid, and the principal and interest due for the second half of the year are about to be due. Therefore, a circular was issued to the two railway bureaus requiring them to tighten their belts and reduce expenditures except for urgent matters that need to be undertaken, in order to benefit the finances and supplement the remedy.</p>

<p>Tai Koo Seafarers' Salary Increase Agreement to Be Signed Next Week</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m., representatives Liu Yuzhou and Wang Yongsheng from the Seafarers' Union met with Yu Qiaqing regarding the salary increase for Tai Koo seafarers. Mr. Yu stated that he was scheduled to return to Ningbo that evening and would return to Shanghai today to participate in the Industrial and Commercial Conference. The signing of the agreement between Tai Koo labor and management must wait until next week. However, he would relay the union's willingness to resolve the issue to Tai Koo, and he did not expect any other obstacles to arise. After the Industrial and Commercial Conference closes and returns to Shanghai, mediation will continue with Nissin, Jardine Matheson, and other foreign shipping companies.</p>

<p>The Shanghai West area is vast and densely populated. The construction of the municipality requires the combined efforts of everyone. Citizens Chen Yafu, Wang Tongfu, Chen Zhen, and Shen Zongquan organized the Shanghai West Improvement Association last year, with more than one hundred members. They published the New Shanghai West Newspaper and led the public in various construction publicity efforts, sparing no effort. Recently, the Central Government promulgated the Law on the Organization of People's Organizations, and they submitted a document to the Shanghai Special City Party Department Civil Training Association for approval to prepare the case. The association sent personnel to investigate and deemed it qualified, and the Civil Training Association issued Approval Order No. 412, approving the establishment and issuing Permit No. 13. A general meeting of members will be held immediately to discuss all future proceedings.</p>

<p>Xiao Jianxing's Sister Learns to Dance at Fang's</p>
<p>Fang Dewen Claims He Has a Generous Reward</p>
<p>Liu Changming Kneels Before His Elderly Mother</p>
<p>Another Suspect Arrested Yesterday</p>
<p>Five days after being kidnapped, Yuan Shunwu, a second-year student at Datong University on Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai, was rescued by the Sixth District police, who captured the main culprits. The details of the kidnapping and rescue have already been reported in this newspaper. After learning the details of the successful rescue in this case, which was quite interesting, we are providing a more detailed account below:</p>
<p>After Yuan was kidnapped, District Chief Ren of the Sixth District received the report and personally led Inspector Xu and the entire team of detectives to pursue the kidnappers, but without success. District Chief Ren then inquired with the Shi surname student who witnessed Yuan's kidnapping about all the details. Shi stated that Zou Yaodong, who currently resides at 123 Hanbi Li Road in Hongkou, was well acquainted with Yuan. When Yuan was kidnapped, three bandits claimed that Zou had come to visit Yuan, and Yuan, unsuspecting, went out. The three bandits then forced Yuan into a car, so Zou was highly suspected. On the morning of the 25th, Inspector Xu was ordered to go to Zou's residence in Hongkou with Detective Team Leader Liu Shaoqing, detectives Gan Youxin, Hu Rui, Wang Zengfa, and Tang Bingxiang, and arrest Zou. Zou was transferred to the Special District Court. Inspector Xu requested extradition, which was approved, and Zou was taken back to the station. District Chief Ren repeatedly interrogated Zou, who claimed to be well acquainted with Yuan and firmly denied any involvement in the case. Late that evening, Zou suggested that Xiao Jianxing, who resides at 112 Fuchunfang, Fangbang Road, must be involved. On the morning of the 26th, District Chief Ren sent Liu Shaoqing and Gan Youxin to Xiao's residence, but Xiao and his wife had already left early in the morning, according to the second landlord. However, Yang, who teaches Xiao's sister to dance, was at home. Liu inquired with Yang, who claimed not to know where Xiao had gone. Xiao's wife, Yu, was currently at 105 East Yalu Road in Hongkou. Liu instructed Yang to lead the way and ordered Wang Zengfa, Tang Bingxiang, and Hu Rui to guard Xiao's residence. Liu and others went to Yu's residence and arrested her, taking her back to the station. District Chief Ren interrogated Yu, who claimed to be nineteen years old. She did not know whether her husband was involved in Yuan Shunwu's kidnapping, but she did know that Yi Peihan, who resided on the third floor of a clothing store at 31 Ximenli, Ximen Road, was the mastermind. She also did not know where her husband had gone. District Chief Ren then sent Liu Shaoqing and others to Ximenli to arrest Yi, but without success. Just as they returned to the station, Wang Zengfa and others had guarded and arrested Xiao Jianxing, bringing him to the station. District Chief Ren interrogated Xiao, who claimed to be twenty-eight years old and from Hanyang. Initially, he firmly denied any involvement in Yuan's case. Only after his wife was brought in for questioning did he confess that Yi Peihan was the mastermind, but Yi had already taken residence in a hotel across from the Qingquan Bathhouse in the concession, and his name had been changed to Ye Kang. He was scheduled to go to Hanyang the next day. After obtaining this information, District Chief Ren ordered the five detectives Liu Shaoqing and Gan Youxin to go to various hotels at the border between the British and French concessions to investigate. Before long, Wang Zengfa and Tang Bingxiang found Ye Kang in Room 30 of the Unified Hotel. They immediately joined Liu and others and entered the room. The bellhop said that the guest had gone out and would not return until 12:00. Liu and others then opened a room in Room 36 and waited inside. Around 11:00, a person came to Room 30 and knocked on the door, calling for Ye. Liu and others immediately lured the person back to their room. The person, who was identified as Fang Dewen, knew he had been caught by detectives and immediately handed over 170 yuan to Gan, begging for help. Gan sealed the money in red paper and had it inspected by the French Concession detective. Liu and others waited until 1:30 and not seeing Ye, took Fang to the French Concession police station. The police chief briefly interrogated Fang and confirmed that Liu and others were allowed to take him back. As they were getting into the car, Fang again promised Liu and Gan to reward them with 500 yuan the next day, asking for their help. After taking him to the station, District Chief Ren received a phone call from the Public Security Bureau saying that Yi Peihan had been arrested by a supervisor on the ship. District Chief Ren immediately escorted the Fang to the Public Security Bureau. On the 27th, the Third Section Chief of the Public Security Bureau interrogated Yi and Fang and concluded that the kidnapping had been orchestrated by Liu Changming, an Anhui native living in the fourth house in Huaxingfang. All they needed to do was interrogate Liu. District Chief Ren waited until 2:00 a.m. on the 28th and personally led the entire team of detectives and two patrol officers Xu and Wei to the address. They arrested Liu Changming and took him to the First Division of the Fourth District. Liu then readily confessed, but said that since he had committed the crime and was arrested, he deserved to be punished. He would surely be shot in the future. He only begged the District Chief to let him see his seventy-year-old mother. District Chief Ren sent a police officer to bring his mother over. Liu knelt down and said to his mother, "I have committed such a crime and cannot repay my mother's kindness in raising me. I deserve to die and will only be able to repay you in the next life." He also asked the District Chief to fulfill his request. District Chief Ren, seeing his pitiful old mother, sent a police officer to take her home. As the mother left, Liu said that he would go and find the hostage. Liu then led the way to rescue the hostage Yuan. This is the beginning and the end of the entire ordeal. Also, the Sixth District Public Security Bureau learned that a kidnapper named Wang Leshan from Anhui was looking for someone at that address. Yao, the Chief of the First Division of the Fourth District, learned of this and immediately led two patrol officers Ye and Li and armed police to Ninganfang to arrest Wang. They found 53 yuan in cash on his person and learned that he had a check for 200 yuan stored in a hotel. Chief Yao Benyuan verified the confession and concluded that Wang Leshan was carrying cash and had a check deposited in the hotel, which was related to the bandits, and ordered him to be taken to the bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Sentenced to One Year of Imprisonment</p>
<p>With a Three-Year Suspended Sentence</p>
<p>Wei Min (also known as Wei Yancan), the protagonist of the sensational case of drowning his wife and child and attempting to commit suicide in the river, was convicted. His wife, Xu, and son, Wei Tang, both drowned. Wei was rescued and taken to the District Court Prosecutor's Office for questioning and prosecution. The criminal court found Wei guilty of aiding and abetting suicide and held a public trial. At the conclusion of the debate, the sentence was set for the 30th. Yesterday, Judge Zhao Yongzhou specially opened the Third Court at 11:00 a.m. and briefly questioned Wei Yancan. After going through the process, he announced in court that Wei Yancan was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for inciting murder, with a three-year suspended sentence. After the sentence was announced, the judge briefly explained the reasons for the judgment. Regarding the death of his wife, Xu, he said that it was a case of joint suicide, and in accordance with Article 290, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the charges were dismissed. Regarding the death of his son, Wei Tang, he said that he was only twelve years old and had not yet reached adulthood and lacked the ability to distinguish right from wrong, so he should be punished. However, the suicide was confirmed to be a true event and was very pitiful, so the sentence was suspended. He asked Wei if he accepted the sentence, and Wei replied that he did and signed the document before leaving the court. Wei was still handed over to his original guarantor.</p>

<h3 id="e141">The Wife of a German Ship Stoker Is Unaccustomed to Sleeping Alone <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Stoker Only Returns Home Every Six Months</p>
<p>So the Wife Has an Affair</p>
<p>Wu Aifeng, a 23-year-old woman from Ningbo, used to be a hostess at the rooftop garden of the New World Company. On September 21st of last year, she married Weng Shude, a fellow villager, and they lived together at 1547 Seward Road. Weng worked as a stoker in the engine room of a German foreign ship. The ship traveled between Germany and Shanghai, so Weng could only return home once every six months. Wu Aifeng, because her husband was away from home for a long time, was unaccustomed to sleeping alone and had an affair. Some time ago, the ship arrived in Shanghai from abroad, and Weng returned home. Wu immediately told Weng that there was no money for household expenses and it was difficult to make ends meet. Weng then gave her 235 yuan. Wu took the money and ran away without a trace. Weng became suspicious and investigated carefully, and learned that his wife had been having an affair with a butcher named Zhou Heshang and had rented a house at 953 Datong Road, Shanhai Pass Road, acting like a married couple. He was furious and hired a car for the evening of the accident to go to the location to bring his wife back, but Wu refused and shouted loudly. No. 2194 in the nearby chinese settlement heard the alarm and rushed to apprehend Wu Aifeng, Zhou Heshang, and Weng Shude together to the Xinzha Police Station. After the police chief inquired, Wu was found to be having an affair with Zhou, which was true, and they were ordered to be taken into custody separately. The case was sent to the Special District Court Simple Court yesterday morning, where Judge Cheng Shangfeng heard the case. According to the report of police chief gooder, and the testimony of the plaintiff Weng Shude, the defendant Wu Aifeng (that is, Weng Wu) is my wife, and we married on September 21st last year, with carpenter Asheng as the matchmaker, and stated the above situation. When asked to the defendant Wu Aifeng, the defendant Wu Aifeng confessed that the plaintiff used to live not far from my house in Tongzhou Road, and I often went out to drink water, and the plaintiff came to flirt with me, so I had an affair. At that time, my mother was ill and learned of this matter and was furious and wanted to beat me to death, so I went directly to the plaintiff's place on September 21st of last year to live together. I and the plaintiff are also having an affair and not a formal couple, but I admit to having an affair with Zhou Heshang. This time, the plaintiff came home from abroad and confined me at home for several days. Then, on a certain day, two of the plaintiff's friends came to discuss with the plaintiff about wanting to take me to a foreign port to sell me. I heard this and was terrified, so I took the opportunity to escape under the pretext of buying alcohol. When questioned, Zhou Heshang said that in March of this year, I went to the New World Company to play, and Wu came to serve tea. After talking to each other, Wu said that her husband was working abroad and there was no money at home, so she asked me to help. I then invited friends to Wu's house to play mahjong and became acquainted and had an affair. I first rented a house on the upper floor of the Yitaixiang tobacco and paper shop on Yunnan Road, and moved to Datong Road at the beginning of this month, etc. After verifying the confession, Judge Cheng ordered the two defendants to each pay 500 yuan in guarantee money and wait for a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Doctor Forbids Coffee Due to a Heart Condition in the Left Lung <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>A Polish Man Disobeys Doctor's Orders</p>
<p>Dies After Drinking a Cup of Coffee</p>
<p>A Polish chef named Ge Luobu Weis, working at the Maishitong Russian Coffee Shop at No. 8 Central Road, had a lifelong fondness for alcohol. Ten years ago, a doctor diagnosed him with alcohol poisoning that had caused a heart condition in his left lung, forbidding him from drinking alcohol or coffee, as it would harm his health. Mr. Ge initially ○ complied, but soon began drinking small amounts of coffee. The day before yesterday, before going out to buy groceries in the early morning, he drank another cup of coffee and collapsed, losing consciousness. People rushed him to Renji Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and he died. His body was sent to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Huaipu, an investigator appointed by the Special Court, arrived at the office and confirmed the cause of death. According to the deceased's wife, Ke Le Pu Fusi Ji, a Russian resident of No. 518 Aiwenyi Road, her husband had a pre-existing heart condition, and this was likely a relapse that led to his death. Mr. Guo determined that the deceased, Polish national Ge Luobu Weis, died due to a pre-existing illness, and the body was released to his wife for funeral arrangements.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Extension of Technician Certificate Renewal Period <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>A Final Extension of Six Months</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Notified the Public Works Bureau Yesterday</p>
<p>According to Articles 13 and 14 of the Regulations for the Implementation of Technician Registration, individuals who obtained certificates according to the separate regulations for technician registration by local governments before the implementation of the Technician Registration Regulations, and those who passed the technician qualification examination of the former Beijing Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, should apply to the competent ministry for certificate issuance within six months of the new regulations' implementation. The effective date of these regulations was October 10, 1929. Therefore, the issuance of registration certificates for the technicians mentioned in the aforementioned two articles should have ceased after April 10, 1930. However, the Ministries of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture, and Mining found that the number of applicants complying with the regulations and applying for certificate issuance by the deadline was still limited. Considering that people in remote provinces and regions were unable to apply for new certificates on time due to transportation difficulties, they submitted a request to extend the deadline by another six months. Nevertheless, by October 10, 1930, the deadline expired again. The two ministries reviewed the qualified technician examination files transferred from the former Beijing Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, and found that many had still not applied for new certificates according to the law. Although there were no quotas or verifiable files for technicians registered with local governments, the number of those who had been granted extensions was still very small. It was found that the main reason was that the internal political situation in the country, the suppression of the reactionary military, had not been fully completed, and that bandit-communist disturbances made travel unsafe, making it impossible to renew certificates by the deadline. To show leniency, the two ministries submitted another request for a further extension of six months, declaring that there would be no further extensions after the deadline to emphasize the limitations. It is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Government received instructions from the Executive Yuan yesterday regarding the extension of the technician certificate renewal deadline and immediately instructed the Public Works Bureau to notify the public.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Investigation of Water Patrol Captain's Embezzlement of Opium Case Concluded <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Xu Yan's Request to Suspend Detention Denied</p>
<p>Xu Yan, the captain of the water patrol team, was accused of accepting a bribe of 1,300 yuan to release two opium traffickers and embezzling 3,816 taels of opium. The deputy captain, Dou Menggan (Jiazhen), secretly reported this to Director Yuan, who dispatched inspectors to investigate. They recovered the original stolen goods and arrested Xu Yan, along with clerk Jiang Shihe, boatman Zhou Fucheng, and sent them to the local court for detention. Detectives Ma Zhiyun and Zhang Mingfa, who were on the run, were also sought. Furthermore, the court also learned that the North Xinjing water patrol sub-team had also sent a large batch of red pills to the main team, and there were also instances of corruption and monthly fee collection. Therefore, the court dispatched bailiffs to summon patrol officer Wang Shuxiu, Li Chenghua, patrol chief Wu Minzhen, patrol chief Zhang Yushu, sub-team patrol officer Li Hanwen, patrol officers Li Chengrong, Wang Hongnian, Chen Baozhen, Tian Jingyun, Jiang Zhengde, Wang Fulu, as well as deputy captain Dou Menggan, and Xu Yan's wife, Xu Xie, to a secret court hearing yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. The hearing concluded at 5:00 PM. Regarding the red pills, Xu Yan accused Li Hanwen of wrongdoing, but Li defended himself against the false accusation. At the same time, all patrol officers and chiefs attacked Xu Yan. Xu Yan requested suspension of detention and bail, but the case was serious, and he was the main culprit, so the request was denied. He truly overestimated himself. Currently, Xu Yan, Jiang Shihe, and Zhou Fucheng are still in custody, but Xu is receiving more preferential treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Shipping Accident During Storm <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Wheat Vessel Capsizes, Crew Missing</p>
<p>Great Losses Due to Soaked Wheat</p>
<p>Ship owner Yang Maomao recently loaded 200 dan of wheat in Pingwang and set sail for Shanghai to deliver it to a certain flour mill. The ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and docked south of the Nanshi Cement Factory. Because it was not unloaded, Yang and others returned home, leaving only a crew member and an apprentice to guard the ship. However, around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, it rained heavily, coinciding with high tide. The guards were asleep when the rain became heavy, the load increased, and the mooring rope was broken by the waves. The ship capsized. The guards and the apprentice woke up in panic, both falling into the river. However, the apprentice grabbed the mooring rope and pulled himself up. The other crew member is missing. Fortunately, the ship was in a shallow area and was leaning against the riverbank. However, the wheat in the front cabin was lost, and half of the wheat in the middle cabin was also lost. The remaining wheat was soaked in water. When Yang and others arrived at the ship yesterday morning to unload the cargo, they saw that the ship had capsized. They immediately hired a boat to help upright the ship. After inspecting the ship, they found that most of the oars and equipment were lost. Only sixty or seventy dan of wheat remained, and the bow of the ship was damaged. They immediately reported to the flour mill and requested that they hire a boat to unload the wheat. However, upon learning this, the factory sent someone to inspect the ship and saw that the goods inside the ship were already wet, so they refused to accept the wheat. The estimated losses are huge. They immediately telegraphed the wheat merchant in Pingwang to inform them of the loss. It is unknown who will bear this loss.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Large-Scale Brawl Among Workers in Wusong <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Yu Changhai, a 29-year-old Jiangbei Lianshui native and porter at the Xiyong'an No. 2 Yarn Factory in Wusong Yunzaobang, had a dispute with worker Wang Changhai (a 27-year-old Anhui native) while working at the factory the day before yesterday over portering rights. Although they were separated at the time, they agreed to meet at the Letian Tea House on the Outer Ma Road yesterday to settle the matter. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Yu Changhai only arrived with his father, Yu Tongfei (60 years old). However, Wang Lianghai had gathered thirty to forty friends and demanded that Yu apologize and host a feast of three or four tables as compensation. Because Yu refused to agree, they started fighting immediately, using teapots and benches as weapons, creating a huge and unstoppable commotion. Wang Guangheng, the guard of the 4th Watch Station of the 1st Precinct of the 7th District, noticed the commotion, fearing a major disaster, and blew his whistle, summoning three or five officers to arrest the accomplices. Upon seeing this, the workers took the opportunity to escape, leaving only the ringleader Wang Lianghai and the injured Yu Tongfei and his son to be taken into custody for interrogation. The owner of the Letian Tea House, whose teapots, bowls, and benches were damaged during the brawl, also submitted a list of damages to the police station and requested compensation.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Charcoal Baskets Filled with Opium <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Totaling 105 Taels</p>
<p>Chen Er'a Detained for One Year</p>
<p>The day before yesterday at noon, a cart puller named Chen Moji from Tongzhou was transporting seven baskets of charcoal through Qichang Road. Chinese Constable No. 1847 and Western Detective Xiang No. 372 from the Hongkou Police Station found his behavior suspicious and questioned him. Chen stated that the cart was going to the New Dahua Hotel at No. 147 Fuzhou Road to deliver the charcoal. The detective then ordered the constable to follow behind while he went to wait in front of the hotel. After a while, Chen Er'a from Wuxi came out to receive the goods. Seeing the detectives and constables nearby, he realized the situation was dire and turned around to run into the hotel, closing the door. The detectives and constables broke down the door, arrested Chen, and the cart puller Chen Moji pointed out that Chen Er'a was his employer. The detectives and constables then opened the charcoal baskets and found 105 taels of opium hidden at the bottom. They were all taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station stated the case and claimed that the cart puller Chen Moji was a witness but was detained for questioning due to concerns about his potential involvement. Chen Er'a claimed that someone surnamed Jia, who was on the run, had shipped the charcoal baskets from the Yangtze River to Shanghai and unloaded them at the Ewo Wharf. He only asked Chen Moji to transport the seven baskets of charcoal to the hotel because he temporarily had a loose tongue. He claimed he was waiting there and did not know that the charcoal contained opium. His remaining testimony was evasive. Chen Moji stated that Chen Er'a asked him to send the seven baskets of charcoal to the hotel at the wharf, and he knew nothing else. He also stated that he had not received the six jiao cart fee and asked for judgment. Judge Ge Zhitian verified that Chen Er'a's opium trafficking was real and sentenced Chen Er'a to one year of imprisonment for intending to sell and transport opium, with a fine of 300 yuan. If the fine was not paid after enforcement, two yuan would be converted to one day of imprisonment. The pretrial detention period would be deducted. The 105 taels of opium and the seven baskets of charcoal were confiscated. Chen Moji was acquitted and released.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Summary of the Rice Market Regulation Association Meeting <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>This summer, the price of rice in Shanghai continued to rise sharply during the transition between seasons. Although the price limit was 20 yuan per shi (unit of volume), the actual price exceeded this by 2 to 3 yuan. Residents found it difficult to obtain food, and with the urgent military situation in the front lines and instability in the rear, unscrupulous elements took the opportunity to incite unrest, posing a threat to the security of Shanghai. Yu Qiaqing, a leader in the business community, was deeply concerned about this and launched the Shanghai Rice Market Regulation Movement, preparing a large sum of one million yuan to purchase large quantities of rice in bulk and sell it at a loss to stabilize the rice price. The announcement of this plan immediately caused the rice price to fall. After the Rice Market Regulation Association held a meeting yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency, recognizing the significant impact of the association's actions on the rice market, visited the association's chairman, Yu Qiaqing, to inquire about the association's work. Mr. Yu stated that the Rice Market Regulation Movement could be considered a success, and the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Government had provided strong support, each allocating 50,000 yuan in silver. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement allocated 100,000 yuan in silver and planned to continue providing support. Fortunately, there was a good harvest in various regions, and the price of rice gradually decreased, eliminating the need to lose all the planned funds. However, because the price decreased significantly, the loss per shi exceeded the initial estimate, which was a fortunate outcome, as residents could purchase cheaper rice. In conclusion, the success of this effort was partly due to the cooperation of the Shanghai Municipal Council, demonstrating the importance of Sino-foreign cooperation. Mr. Yu then showed the reporter the letters to be sent to the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Government, which are transcribed below: (1) Regarding the Shanghai rice price, which continued to rise sharply before the establishment of the Association, it was difficult for the citizens to obtain food. In the autumn when the crops were not yet ready, the military situation in the front lines was tight, and the people in the rear were facing a food shortage. The problem of public order was precarious. Therefore, since the establishment of the Association, large quantities of rice have been purchased, and we have declared that we will sell at a loss to stabilize the rice price. As a result, those who hoard, speculate, monopolize, and manipulate the market dare not raise prices excessively and sell them at a reduced price. The rice price has continued to fall, by a total of four to five yuan. Fortunately, new grains have been harvested and there have been bumper crops in various places, the military situation has ended, public order is not a concern, and the price of rice has continued to decline. Although it cannot be said that the Association has completely suppressed the rice price, it has had some effect in regulating the rice market, which is something that we are able to inform your departments about. Here is a summary of the funds collected and the amount lost: We have received a total of 50,000 yuan in silver from your Ministry, 50,000 yuan in silver from the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Finance, and 100,000 yuan in silver from the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. We have purchased three batches of foreign rice, each batch consisting of 15,000 bags, for a total of 45,000 bags, totaling 50,400 shi. The purchase price was 7 taels and 9 qian of silver per 100 jin. The first batch was calculated at 150 jin per shi, totaling 17 yuan and 2 jiao of silver. The second and third batches were calculated at 7 taels and 7.5 qian of silver per 100 jin, totaling 17 yuan of silver per shi. 26,804 shi and 9 dou and 6 sheng have already been sold, losing 2 yuan and 4 jiao and 5 fen, 4 yuan and 2 jiao, 2 yuan and 1 jiao, and 4 yuan respectively, totaling 82,467 yuan and 8 jiao and 4 fen. There are still 23,595 shi and 4 he that have been sold but not delivered. Because the price of rice has fallen sharply, they can only be sold for 10 yuan and 1 jiao of silver per shi, losing 6 yuan and 9 jiao of silver per shi, totaling 162,805 yuan and 7 jiao and 8 fen. The total loss is 245,273 yuan and 6 jiao and 2 fen. In addition, adding in the costs of weighing, warehousing, and other expenses, the total loss is approximately 256,000 yuan. We are now requesting that your Ministry allocate an additional 30,000 yuan in silver in addition to the 50,000 yuan previously allocated to help us close the operation. After the closing is completed, we will prepare a detailed list and report it to you. We would like to request that you investigate and promptly allocate the 30,000 yuan in silver to facilitate the closing.</p>

<p>To Pursue Citizen Participation in Politics</p>
<p>The representatives of the Shanghai French Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association have been requesting the French authorities to implement citizen participation in politics for two years. Since the French Consul General Gao Delin invited Chinese directors Du Yuesheng, Cheng Zhusun, chairman of the Ratepayers' Association, Shang Mujang, and others for a meeting last month, Consul General Gao, Municipal Superintendent Fan Erdi, Du Yuesheng, Cheng Zhusun, Shang Mujang, and others have held several discussions, and the following has been agreed upon: (1) The number of Chinese directors in the French Municipal Council will remain the same, but the Ratepayers' Association must hold a supplementary election. (2) The French Municipal Council will establish nine Chinese committee seats (including three specialized committee seats) to be elected by the Ratepayers' Association. (3) The French Municipal Council's municipal gazettes and announcements regarding Chinese affairs will be announced in Chinese from 1931 onwards. (4) The French Municipal Council will sincerely cooperate with the Ratepayers' Association in implementing measures to improve the municipality. Because the Ratepayers' Association needs to complete items (1) and (2) by November, it plans to convene a representative meeting immediately to prepare everything.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Study and Improve the Manufacture of Mechanized Egg Yolks <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Commodity Inspection Bureau Sent a Letter to the Egg Factory Trade Association Calling for Attention to Research</p>
<p>The Shanghai Egg Factory Trade Association stated that the U.S. government had strictly revised its regulations since 1923, limiting the acidity of imported Chinese egg yolks to five degrees. Egg yolks exceeding this limit would be rejected as spoiled. However, from manufacturing to delivery to the United States, the egg yolks manufactured by various egg factories in our country often take more than six months. It is difficult to guarantee that the acidity will not gradually increase. If the acidity increases to five degrees when they arrive in the United States, they will not be allowed to be imported, and the impact will be significant. To prevent this problem, the association recently consulted with the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to discuss relief measures. It is heard that the Inspection Bureau believes that if high-quality fresh eggs are used and manufactured according to scientific principles, egg yolks can be stored for a long time, even for two years, without spoiling under normal circumstances. The fact that the acidity of egg yolks manufactured by various egg factories in our country increases to five degrees after six months suggests that there are imperfections in the manufacturing materials and methods. Therefore, the Bureau sent a letter to the association urging them to improve the manufacturing using the most rigorous scientific methods so that the foreign trade of egg yolks would not be affected by the new U.S. regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Funding Secured for Dredging Yu Tang River <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Yu Tang River in Shanghai County is an important river that has gradually become silted in recent years. Therefore, the County Construction Bureau and local figures have discussed plans for dredging. Funding for dredging the river has been requested by the County Government from the Provincial Financial and Construction Departments, which has been approved by the Provincial Finance Department and submitted to the Provincial Government. It has been determined that the Yu Tang River is an important river in the county and that dredging it is a key local water conservancy project. Therefore, it is approved that 1 jiao per mu be collected from the busy season land tax on the farmland benefiting from the river on both banks this year, and 5 fen per mu be collected from the upper busy season land tax in the twentieth year. The County Construction Bureau Director Wu has already submitted the budget for dredging expenses, standard cross-section drawings, a list of earthwork, a longitudinal profile of Yu Tang, and topographic maps to the Construction Department for review. It is also learned that the dredging expenses will be collected locally by the beneficiaries following the old precedents of the Qing Dynasty. Landowners will provide food, tenants will provide labor, and the amount of dredging will be determined based on the distance from the river and the amount of benefit received.</p>

<h3 id="e163">National Opium Seizures by Railway Bureaus in the 18th Year of the Republic of China <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Statistics from the Investigation Department of the Chinese National Anti-Narcotics Association</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Narcotics Association this year collected statistical materials on opium prohibition throughout the country. Since transportation agencies on both land and water often discover and seize travelers carrying opium, raw opium, and narcotics, various institutions such as post offices and railway bureaus nationwide also collect such data. Regarding post offices, the Association's Investigation Department has already published the opium-related seizures in various newspapers. It is now reported that the anti-narcotics materials from various railway bureaus nationwide have been compiled by Zhou Chucai, the Director of Statistical Investigations of the Association. From January 1, 1929, to December 31, 1929, a total of 203 offenders were apprehended, and 31,457.4 taels of opium were seized. The details are as follows: Jinghu and Huhangyong Railways: 56 offenders, 7,569 taels of opium; Jinpu Railway: 20 offenders, 2,223.9 taels; Jiaoji Railway: 6 offenders, 172.4 taels; Pinghan Railway: 23 offenders, 4,614.8 taels; Beining Railway: 17 offenders, 1,477 taels; Nanxun Railway: 3 offenders, 1,349 taels; Guangjiu Railway: 11 offenders, 901 taels; Yuehan Railway (Guangshao Section): 6 offenders, 227 taels; Yuehan Railway (Xiang'e Section): 14 offenders, 11,869 taels; Shenhai Railway: 2 offenders, 60 taels; Jichang Railway: 35 offenders, 52.5 taels; Jidun Railway: 3 offenders, 16.8 taels; Tao'ang Railway: 1 offender, 19 taels; Sitao Railway: 4 offenders, 408 taels; Huhai Railway: 2 offenders, 22 taels. Total: 203 offenders, 31,457.4 taels. The above statistics are from the fifteen railway administrations. The Longhai and Pingsui Railways have not yet submitted their reports due to transportation disruptions. It is also noted that no passengers were found to be carrying raw opium. The Yuehan Railway (Zhushao Section), Zhangsha Railway, and Qike Railway seized narcotics but no opium. The Xinning Railway, Jihai Railway, Daoqing Railway, and Zhengtai Railway seized neither opium nor narcotics. Additionally, the Cangshi and Taosuo Railways are not included as they have not yet been completed. The Association is also analyzing the narcotics seized by the various railway bureaus, such as morphine, red pills, and white pills, and will soon publish a joint report with the postal service seizures.</p>

<p>Demonstration Scheduled at the Capital's Industry and Commerce Conference</p>
<p>The Zhendan Chicken Ball Brand chemical foam fire extinguisher has been repeatedly demonstrated in the capital and Shanghai, attracting much attention from the public. The manufacturer originally planned to hold a large-scale public demonstration at the Shanghai Public Sports Ground on the first of next month, inviting guests from all walks of life to attend. However, the date for the capital demonstration was originally scheduled for the fourth. Yesterday, the manufacturer received a telegram from its Beijing representative stating that the Industry and Commerce Conference would open on the first of next month and requested that a demonstration be held at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of that day in the vacant lot next to the Construction Committee in Xihua Men, Capital, to coincide with the conference. The manufacturer has already dispatched personnel to Beijing to make arrangements. The original date in Shanghai will likely be postponed.</p>

<p>— Xin Mu</p>
<p>When a person's sorrow reaches its extreme, tears are exhausted, and only mad laughter remains.</p>
<p>If you find divorce too troublesome, you might as well add a clause to your marriage contract in advance: "Future separations are at each party's discretion."</p>
<p>The word "love" is attainable by everyone, but only temporarily by some, and permanently by few.</p>
<p>Don't envy others; know that others are envying you.</p>
<p>Those who truly understand freedom can enjoy it; those who cannot control themselves feel unfree everywhere.</p>
<p>Those who love others are loved; those who respect others are respected. Those who are arrogant and delight in attacking others' shortcomings will inevitably face others' contempt and criticism.</p>
<p>Although a mirror can reflect one's face, it cannot reflect the heart within.</p>
<p>The workers daily joyfully envy the boss's happiness and wealth, but they never know that his inner suffering is even greater than theirs.</p>
<p>The husband envies his wife's ease, while the wife says men are happy. In reality, it's six of one, half a dozen of the other. How many people in the world are truly at ease?</p>
<p>Those with a narrow mind cannot tolerate others and will never achieve great things.</p>
<p>Those who are despised everywhere blame the coldness of human feelings instead of recognizing their own faults. This is simply a blind heart.</p>
<h3 id="e168">What I Know of "Mr. Hui" <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Dingming</p>
<p>Mr. Hui, also named Guang, courtesy name Siwen, was from Qingjian County, northern Shaanxi, only ninety li from Wangyaobao, jointly governed by my Fushi and Anding, a day's walk away. There is a children’s rhyme: "Qingjian's stone slabs, Yaobao (i.e., the popular name for Wangyaobao) has coal, Suide has women, and Mizhi has men." The rocks of Qingjian are cyan, firm, and thin. With a little effort from stonemasons, they can be made into squares and circles of any size. Wangyaobao is located in the center of Anding, with connections in all directions. Coal mines are everywhere. The northern lands are extremely cold in winter. Having this natural fuel, one does not feel it. Therefore, the counties all envy it and have this song. As for the women of Suide, it is said to refer to Diaochan of the Three Kingdoms. The men of Mizhi refer to Lu Bu. In fact, Suide and Mizhi are prosperous and absorbed culture earlier than other counties. Men's and women's clothing is also more fashionable than in other counties.</p>
<p>When Mr. Hui returned to his hometown from abroad, it caused a sensation in northern Shaanxi. I was just a child at the time, entering school. The school's teaching methods were autocratic. All day long, the sound of reading aloud could not stop. Therefore, I did not know anything about Mr. Hui. In the fifth year of the Republic, the bandit Guo Jian disturbed northern Shaanxi, breaking Qingjian on the third day of the third month and Suide on the fifth day. My elder brother, Dingli, was studying at the Suide Elementary School and was killed. My family was greatly affected. In the sixth year of the Republic, the bandits Zhang Qingshan and Li Qinglan were incorporated in northern Shaanxi. Mr. Hui, seeing this, sold his property to engage in revolution and allied with Zhang and Li, greatly softening them. In the eighth month, Mr. Hui came to my fortress one day and rode with Zhang and Li in the suburbs. At that time, I still had two small braids hanging behind my head. One day after school, I saw his demeanor. He was less than five feet tall, with disheveled short hair, refined and cultured. The words "foreign student" were the catchphrase of my peers. A few days later, I heard that he had returned. Two days later, there was a burst of gunfire on the riverbank east of the city. I followed the sound to the top of the city, where the spectators were many. More than ten corpses lay in pools of blood below the city. They had secretly gone out at night to cause trouble and were discovered by Zhang and Li. They were executed by firing squad the next day. From then on, the people dared to interact with the soldiers without fear of being violated. It was Mr. Hui's initiative that made Zhang and Li's discipline so strict and meritorious. On August 26th of that year, Zhang and Li left northern Shaanxi from Wangyaobao via Mr. Hui to join the Jingguo Army and carry out the revolution. This is probably what is recorded in the reports about Mr. Hui, that "in the sixth year of the Republic, he raised five hundred men in northern Shaanxi, calling it Mr. Hui's army." After that, due to inconvenient transportation, everything was unknown. Only when Mr. Hui went to southern Shaanxi with Zhang and Li, for the sake of his family and hometown, he instructed Zhang and Li to pretend to be forced to leave Shaanxi when changing defenses from Yongping Town to Qingjian, in order to keep his family safe. Now, for more than ten years, the political situation has changed repeatedly, and the women and children of Guanzhong have all passed this on as a good story, and they respect his wisdom, courage, and contributions to the party and the country.</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM on October 26th, Mr. Yu Youren, a member of the Central Committee, and famous people from Shaanxi, including Sun Weidong, Yang Quanjun, Hu Jingquan, Zhou Yaowu, and Ma Wanyan, initiated a memorial service at the Yufo Zen Temple on Binlang Road in western Shanghai. Due to economic and time constraints, I was unable to attend, so I wrote this article to express my admiration.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Trivial Talks on Autumn Chrysanthemums <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yixiao</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum Wine: Brewed with chrysanthemum leaves, this wine can cure illness.</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum Cake: Remove the hearts of chrysanthemum petals, then mix them evenly with glutinous rice flour, rice flour, and white sugar. Steam in a cake steamer until cooked. It is fragrant, sweet, and delicious. Adding red and green threads makes it even more beautiful.</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum Mountain: Select various famous chrysanthemums and plant them in pots. Use red wood to frame them, arranging them in a high-low and varied manner to form a chrysanthemum mountain. It is elegant and pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum Pool: Chrysanthemum Pool is located in Nanyang Prefecture, on the northwest bank of Neixiang. There is chamomile growing nearby. Drinking this water promotes longevity because the chrysanthemum is a longevity guest, so drinking chrysanthemum water also leads to longevity.</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum Pillow: Many used Hang Chrysanthemums, which have been soaked, are often discarded. If accumulated daily and placed in a bamboo basket and dried in a ventilated place, they can be used as a pillow. This is not only a utilization of waste, but can also clear heat and improve eyesight.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Motherly Love <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Miao Zi</p>
<p>Mr. Shaw said, "There is nothing in the world as cruel as war, and there is nothing as peaceful as a mother's love. A mother and her son or daughter are like being side by side in an equation. A mother fully gives her heart, strength, wisdom, experience, and property to her children, as if it is a mathematical "transposition" in this equation. When the number on the children's side reaches its highest degree, the quantity on the mother's side equals zero. But there is no mother in the world who is not willing to sacrifice herself to support her children." These words are truly wonderfully lovely and admirably cautionary.</p>
<p>However, the price that children pay in front of their mothers is often not commensurate. Filial sons and daughters are rare after all, but ungrateful offspring can often be read about in today's social news. I still remember watching the film "慈母"OvertbeHiiil three years ago and being deeply moved. Little lambs who have sweetly slept in the warm embrace of their mothers, ah, you should know how to passionately repay your mothers!</p>
<p>The most tragic thing is that mothers sacrifice themselves to cultivate their children, but the children grow up and abandon their mothers. This kind of thing also happens a lot. There is no need to look for any real evidence. Just look at Ningbo. There is a fairy tale that says that an old female beggar often scolded young people on the street. People all said that she was crazy. Later, someone who knew her history told people, "Her son is still a student studying abroad and is very successful now. That woman raised her son from a young age to adulthood, and it took a lot of effort. Who knew that after her son's feathers were full, he would forget his mother's nurturing grace, so she went crazy."</p>
<p>Also, recently, the Star Film Company has a film "A Prostitute's Virtuous Mother." The content is also about a mother who, in order to cultivate her daughter, endures the shame of working in a brothel to provide her daughter with tuition fees. Although she has suffered a lot of anger, she always wholeheartedly expects her daughter to succeed. Unexpectedly, her daughter grew up and found out that her mother was a prostitute and, without asking the reasons, thought it was a great humiliation to herself and left without saying goodbye. Her mother was extremely anxious when she found out and searched everywhere, eventually going crazy and almost losing her life. Later, she was rescued after attempting to drown herself in the river. The newspaper published the story, and her daughter finally saw it and realized her ingratitude and returned to visit her mother. However, the mother's illness was already beyond help. We try to look at how touching and profound the plot of this film is! I hope that all daughters who have mothers can learn some lessons from this film, just as all sons can learn some lessons from the "Loving Mother" film. Then, Star Company's "A Prostitute's Virtuous Mother" can be considered a success after all.</p>
<h3 id="e171">The Strange Image of the Osmanthus Banquet <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>In Wuzhong, many large buildings and courtyards are planted with parasol trees and osmanthus trees, taking their cool shade and refreshing cleanliness. In Fengxi, near the city, Zhu Zenan is a scholar who, after chanting, likes to plant flowers and cultivate bamboo, not begrudging the labor of watering and weeding. There is an osmanthus tree grafted with a pomegranate. This autumn, the flowers are lush and have changed to crimson. He sings the praises of five osmanthus branches, and his inspiration soars. He then wrote invitations, inviting his literary friends to the osmanthus flower party. For a time, the skirts and shoes of the guests came in droves, and the poetry and wine flowed freely. A certain gentleman in the seat and others carried a camera for photography, and thus took a photo of the osmanthus association chanting picture as a memento. The next day, the certain gentleman developed the image and was surprised. Next to the osmanthus tree there was a woman. Between indistinct impressions, her hair fine, her eyebrows beautiful. The owner, Zhu Zenan, was also surprised and did not know why. Because on the day of the party, the NIngxiang Hall and boudoir were separated and there were no family members present. He showed the developed image to the present literary friends and none could explain it. Some said that there were records of flower demon and tree spirits in historical anecdotes. This must be a flower demon and tree spirit. Some friends advised the host, Zhu Zenan to cut down the tree to prevent disaster, but Zhu Zenan was never superstitious. Thus, the tree still casts its shadow as before. I had the photograph passed on to me. I viewed it and the description was accurate. Being curious, I recorded the matter thus.</p>

<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>Eyebrows are raised and mountains are painted. Bobo Village has dozens of miles of land, the people are few, and the springs are beautiful. If Chinese people can manage orchards here, they will surely reap great profits. It is also possible to build roads and establish hospitals here. This place is in the middle of the north and south and is only one day from Yangon. Those who are suffering from heat-related illnesses can come here for treatment. If we govern this village, it will be no different from an Arcadia. The land can be bought and is not expensive. Burma is peaceful, and bandits are extremely rare. Thieves may or may not be concerned.</p>
<p>A friend said, "Siam and Burma are both Buddhist countries. There is no need to worry about the communist men. Their maleness is subdued by the Buddha, so their hearts are easy to govern. Subdue the male gender, and the world will be peaceful. There is no other secret technique."</p>
<p>Yin Jun's mother's fiftieth birthday was on the fourth. At dawn, the yellow-robed monks were full of seats. The mother, son, and the entire family knelt one by one, offering milk tea and listening to the lecture. Each monk held a bowl. I now had the opportunity to strike the bowl with my hand and test its quality. It had two layers. The lower layer was made of thin iron, and the upper layer was sand and mud with lacquer, which was very beautiful. There were also those made of tile and porcelain. The family placed a rice bowl in each bowl, with several small porcelain cups. Each cup contained chicken, fish, meat, etc. The large pieces of fatty meat were more than an inch thick. Seeing them, my chest felt nauseous. I could not agree with the Theravada teachings of Burma and Siam. Eating the flesh of living beings is no different from Confucianism. What ghostly words are there to say about universally saving people and heaven? It is too wasteful. It is fitting that the Burmese are poor and lazy, and monks are everywhere. Master Taixu's new monk system advocates that there should only be 500 monks per county in China, for a total of 1 million monks. If more knowledge is added, they can guide society. If there are too many, then it is unnecessary. But I advocate following the methods of the Chan school of ancestral work. Having many is also not a problem. If they sit and eat, then they should also be limited to 500 per county. The 500 are not just idlers. They have the Way and science to teach the youth. The effect will be higher than today's teachers who only know material science.</p>
<p>The Burmese treat monks as if they were Buddhas. When they arrive at home, they greet them and bow to them. The monks chant incessantly, and people also imitate them. If everyone in the world were like this, perhaps the evil flames of fierce bandits could also be restrained. However, in a well-off world, the country will surely perish. It is also difficult to say for sure. Siam also practices Theravada and is now independent and free, recovering extraterritorial rights, which is better than us. The problem also lies in impure politics and diplomacy and in the military.</p>
<p>I have seen strange customs here. Some people carry large leather bags to transport water, which is close to the Indian style.</p>

<p>(3) Ten Days in Rome (5)</p>
<p>—The Eternal City La ville eteinelle</p>
<p>June 1st—Exhibition of Spanish Masterpieces and Exhibition of Modern Japanese Painting</p>
<p>It was past twelve o'clock when we came out of the Spanish Exhibition. We wanted to find a cheap and good restaurant to have lunch, but in vain we circled several streets under the scorching sun and turned back and forth, and finally could not find a small restaurant. My feet were sore and I was extremely hungry, so I braced myself and walked into a magnificent Restaurant. Several waiters in ink-black礼服 with shiny hair led us from the door into the dining room and greeted us very diligently. I first drank a few mouthfuls of cold water, and the heat in my heart was reduced by half. Two waiters in equally grand attire each held a beautiful menu for us to look at. Everyone's eyes were ink-black and we could not recognize a single word. When we looked at each other, they almost laughed. This was not because it was ridiculous that we were illiterate, but because our expression was a bit ridiculous. Fortunately, they were accustomed to receiving foreigners, so they offered cold chicken, smoked beef, and the famous Italian pasta for you to choose from. I ordered frozen chicken and Italian pasta. It was extremely happy to eat these delicacies when hungry and thirsty. The scorching sun in Rome in June was truly terrifying. However, I was intoxicated in the beauty and ancient charm of Rome, and I was very excited. After lunch, my spirits were refreshed. We passed through the bustling street from the Piazza Venezia and a magnificent building stood before our eyes. This was the exhibition hall of the city of Rome, like the Grand Palais in Paris, dedicated to general exhibitions. The Japanese Art Exhibition was held inside. We walked in and took a quick tour. There were about twenty rooms, which the Japanese called the Imperial Palace style. The houses were decorated in an elegant and refined manner. Originally, their wood, wall panels, roofs, and even tatami mats were all transported from their country. The carvings on the screens and the potted flowers were purely Japanese in flavor. Speaking of their works, they are all from the hands of first-class modern masters in Japan. Among them, such as Yokoyama Taikan, Takeuchi Seiho, Shimomura Kanzan, Hirafuku Hyakusui, Kawai Gyokudo, Yamamoto Shunkyo, Kobori Tomoto, Hashimoto Kansetsu, Kaburaki Kiyokata, Araki Jippo, Komuro Suisho, Yuki Somei, Ishizaki Komyo, Nishimura Goun, and Domoto Insho, Yamauchi Tamon Tsutaya Ryukaku, the rest I can’t remember. Each person has fifteen or six works. Especially Yokoyama Taikan and Takeuchi Seiho are considered his door representatives. In the central and largest Royal Hall, there are extremely large Xiao Xiang Eight Views. They are considered innovators of Japanese painting. In my opinion, they are still imitating the style of Muqi, Ma Yuan, and Xia Gui.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Fluctuations in the Gold Market <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Long and short positions mutually control, resulting in hesitation. Yesterday's gold market was exceptionally confusing, with alternating advances and retreats. In the morning session, fluctuations of two or three taels were common, while the afternoon saw only one or two taels of movement, inevitably leading to uncertainty. Long and short positions were mutually controlling, although not as chaotic as the day before. Foreign exchange rates slightly softened, with banks engaging in mutual deposits and withdrawals. While trading among the various firms in the market was active, there were no large transactions. In the morning, Fuchang, Yifengyong, Hengxing, and Dadecheng, among others, were buying, while Yuanmaoyong, Yud, and Xinheng had already sold off. The morning market appeared sluggish, and there was no change in overseas gold markets, but exchange rates consistently declined. The hesitating state afterward stemmed from differing supply and demand. Prices had exceeded eighty-four taels, but the lowest point hovered just above eighty taels. The noon hour saw calm, but later, Chenggenghong, Fuxingyong, and arbitragers all entered the market. Yud, Wanxing, and Yongchengchang showed signs of selling. The initial opening was stable, but then became firmer, resulting in a situation similar to the previous day, with prices fluctuating like drifting duckweed.</p>
<p>US Silver Purchases Drive Down Gold Prices. The opening of the December market immediately fell by one tael, reaching 582 taels and 5 qian (gross margin within approximately three taels, once dropping to within two taels). Large bars did not change further. With news of slight purchases of silver bars in the US, market sentiment softened. Subsequently, Zifengyong, Taikangrun, and others bought in, which brought a recovery to 84 taels and 7 qian. Foreign exchange rates remained stable. Korea and Taiwan bought in the spot market. Dalian's silver was at a premium of 1 tael 2 qian 7 fen. Zhengjin traded March Sterling at 17375, then January at 375 could be settled, and Yuanmaoyong selling caused it to retreat to 3 taels 7 or 8 qian. When the initial posting was made, the listed price was around 4 taels. Except for the East Exchange, which was depressed by 0.25, there were no other changes, and it dropped to 3 taels 1 qian. Shortly after, it added 0.45 qian. However, Yuanmaoyong, Taikangrun, and arbitragers sold heavily, especially Sterling. Mitsui bought January, calculated at 174375, thus at 10:00, it fell to 80 taels 0 qian 6 fen. Guangbang Hengxing and others bought in and Zhengjin absorbed January Sterling at 17375. It has now returned to a high of over 2 taels. By 10:30, it rose to 83 taels 3 or 4 qian, but sellers remained strong, with Yud, Fuxingyong, Shunli, and Wanxing selling. Moreover, January Sterling could be settled at 17375, and Macalie and Korea sold it to Shengda and Dalianbang. The gold price then made a second downward move to 80 taels 0 qian 5 fen around 11:00. Afterward, it seemed to stabilize and rose about 2 taels. However, from 11:00 to 12:00, there were fluctuations of more than 1 tael. At closing, it was 82 taels 1 qian, a slight decrease of 0.3 or 0.4 qian. The posted price was changed to 623 taels 4 qian. The gold exchange opened lower by 0.25, initially pressing down to 40 taels, then between 43 and 41 taels.</p>
<p>Various Firms' Pursuits Create a Fluctuating Market. The afternoon market opened at 81 taels 9 qian (gross margin not initially disparate). Afterward, it rose from 81 taels 7 qian to 3 taels 8 qian as Zifengyong and Fuxingyong pursued. Then it slightly decreased by 0.7 or 0.8 qian. After 3:00, the buying side was active because HSBC was buying in, seeing Citibank at 39.125, and the January Sterling banking trade was at 17375. It thus rose to 84 taels 2 or 3 qian. Suddenly, Yud and Yongchengchang came to sell, and it immediately fell by more than 1 tael to 2 taels 7 or 8 qian at 3:30. At 4:00, Fuchang and Yuanheng bought in. Afterward, the market was mediocre, with only a few qian rising or falling. However, retail investors did not cease selling, which depressed it by slightly less than 1 tael to between 83 taels. At the 4:30 closing, it was 83 taels 4 qian, which was only 1 qian lower than the previous day, fluctuating again by 2 or 3 qian, totaling 3 taels 5 or 6 qian. The highest price during the day was 84 taels 7 qian, and the lowest price was 80 taels 5 qian, a difference of 4 taels 2 qian. Looking back at the posted prices, it was depressed by around 40 taels. The records were 91 taels in November, 82 taels in December, a water compensation of 95 to 96 taels. Goods opened at 2 taels 8 qian in the morning, 1 tael 8 qian in the afternoon, and closed at 3 taels 4 qian.</p>
<p>Supply and Demand Varied, Amounts Not Large. Intra-bank transactions included: Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yifengyong, Dadecheng, Hengxing, and Hongli all bought in; Wanxing, Shunli, Yongfeng, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanxingyong, Yud, Fuxingyong, Jinan, and Xinheng all sold out. Zifengyong, Taikangrun, and Yuanchengyong had mixed activity. In goods, Chenggenghong, Fuxingyong, and Fuchang bought in the afternoon; Zifengyong, Dadecheng, and Yuanmaoyong had insignificant buying and selling; Wanxing, Taihengyuan, Yud, Xinheng, and Yongchengchang all sold out. Arbitrage slips were frequently traded. Dalianbang sold a total of 1300 or 1400 slips, while buying 600 or 700 slips. Guangbang slightly replenished, not reaching 1000 slips.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Decline in Both Open and Hidden Japanese Exchange Rates <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants' Transactions Are Not Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silver markets were fairly stable, but Japanese and US exchange rates declined. Yokohama and Kobe showed no improvement. The exchange rate for Guangdong, except for a reduction of 0.25 for Japanese exchange, totaling 1 tael 2 qian 9 fen 25, had no further changes. The domestic market softened slightly, but the market was fairly stable. The gold market was in a state of uncertainty, fluctuating around 4 taels throughout the day, ultimately settling peacefully. Compared to the previous day's noon prices, Sterling rose by 0.0625, US Dollar rose by 0.125, and Japanese exchange fell by 0.075. Chinese merchants' transactions were not weak, but supply and demand differed. Sterling transactions totaled over 100,000 pounds, with banks like Mitsui, Anda, and Zhengjin absorbing. Xingye, Mackellar, Korea, and Youli sold off, while Dalianbang and Shengda Hongli were buying in. Overall, gold merchants' statistics showed more buying than selling, mainly arbitrage slips. Various banks also engaged in interbank transactions of tens of thousands of pounds. Various firms threw out 200,000 US dollars, which HSBC and Mitsui absorbed. Only a small amount of Japanese gold was bought from the previous market by Dalianbang, which issued Dalian notes for future delivery of several million yuan, purchased by Taiwan and Korea in the Huai area. Later in the afternoon, they were slightly towards settlement; the Belgian Bank was also said to have sold.</p>
<p>Sterling Exchange. The domestic market only saw fluctuations of 0.0625 throughout the day. In the morning, the price for November was 1 shilling 7.25 pence, December was 3125, and January was 375.

As for the silver and money industry settlement news, with the end-of-October long-term settlement period approaching, the amount of advance settlements yesterday was very large. Banks had a large number of maturing mortgages and settlements, so settlement procedures were exceptionally cumbersome, but monetary conditions remained loose, resulting in an oversupply of hedging funds.</p>

<p>Yesterday, securities exchanges temporarily suspended trading due to the processing of October futures settlements for public bonds. The total amount of settlements for various bonds reached over 20 million yuan, an increase of about 1 million yuan compared to the September period. However, a sum of more than 13.7 million had already been transferred to accounts in advance on the first day of the week, and only 7 million was actually settled yesterday.

<p>Price: 140 Taels</p>
<p>Quantity: 1850 Taels</p>
<p>At the beginning of October, the standard yarn market was in a good mood due to the pacification of the military affairs in the North. The actual sales were good, so the market was very strong, with prices between 153 and 154 taels. Before long, as US cotton fell and customer sales were not smooth, and the sales of 20-count Five Fortune Shepherd yarn were sluggish, the market situation became even more tired. Some manufacturers viewed the environment as unfavorable and closed out their long positions. The market became more strained, and the sellers had sufficient goods to deliver, so most had to look at 145 taels. The number one buyers viewed the delivery as too large and let go of the entire amount, not receiving a single bale. From this, it fell to the 50 tael mark, and the lowest reached 146 taels. The resulting settlement price was 147 taels. Both the delivery and receiving parties were retail customers, totaling 1,850 bales. 1,400 bales were handled independently, and 450 bales were settled in the books. Of these, 300 bales were of 20-count Five Fortune, 100 bales were of Shepherd, and 50 bales were of 10-count Double Happiness. The names of the brokers for both the delivery and receiving parties are listed below.</p>

<p>Delivery Price: 31 Taels 5 Qian</p>
<p>Delivery Amount: 13,600 Dan</p>
<p>The general trend of the standard cotton market in October was unusually weak. The progressive decline in US cotton and the emergence of new low prices dampened market sentiment. The delivery of both new and old cotton made the market softer. The factories had absorbed enough American and Indian cotton, resulting in less trading of local cotton. Some looked for 30 taels before entering. Before long, US cotton rebounded and rose, and large accounts bought distant futures, making the market firm after being tired. The beginning of the month saw 32 taels 2 or 3 qian. The lowest reached 31 taels 0 qian 5 fen. The resulting settlement price was 31 taels 5 qian, totaling 13,600 dan, with a total value of 428,400 taels. The delivered goods were mostly fire engine cotton. The receiving party, Fenghua, received 5,000 dan. The names of the brokers and brands for both the receiving and delivering parties are listed below.</p>

<p>Yarn Still Stable - Cotton Slightly Slack</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn: The market is still stable. The actual sales are relatively active, so market sentiment is flat. However, the overseas flower and yarn market is slightly tired. 20-count Five Fortune Shepherd, Guangbang bought in 400-500 bales. Standard yarn was closed for one day due to the end of the month's settlement, and spot yarn trading was still good. Statistics show that various groups bought in a total of 975 bales. The market was flat. Among the customer groups, Guangdong bought in 630 bales, the interior bought in 60 bales, Qingdao bought in 140 bales, miscellaneous groups bought in 65 bales, and fellow groups bought in 25 bales.</p>
<p>Cotton Market: The market is calm, but US cotton has been rising for nine consecutive days, and now it has rebounded slightly and fallen. The factories' intentions are still stagnant, so trading has not been very enthusiastic. The source is estimated to be Yao cotton 2,100 bales and Tong cotton 400 bales.</p>
<p>Lumite Order: 40.50, Shenxin Factory bought in 500 pieces, which will be shipped to the factory.</p>

<p>US Cotton Falls Back by Twenty Pounds: Yesterday, US cotton was sold due to a reversal. Southern arbitrage buyers reduced, and the market was tired.

Indian cotton initially rose with US cotton, but then softened due to profit-taking by bulls. Pingguoer and Aomula rose by ten rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by eleven rupees.

<h3 id="e183">Grain and Rice Market Scarce and Firm <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, more than 20 domestic sources were still selling briskly. The new japonica rice market was gradually firm due to the lack of incoming goods, and high-quality goods were slightly higher by 0.1 tael, needing to open at 14.7 yuan. Ordinary and below were favored by some customers, with smooth advances and withdrawals, but shops were still flat. Zhongguan opened at 13 yuan. The arrival of thin japonica rice at the port was scarce and firm, opening high at 12.6 yuan. Sheep Xian rose by 0.15 tael, same as port Xian, with high-quality goods opening at 11.5-6 yuan. Du Jian and Ke Jian rose by 0.2 tael, with a very popular trend. The Xian rice market footings are becoming more stable daily because there is customer interest from abroad and the product price is influencing the situation. The white yuan is becoming steady again, and the new and old market situations have become consistent. A bullish view of 15.5 yuan is seen.</p>
<p>Hunan: Yesterday, not many arrived by river. Sales in this street were still flat. The market for new Tin japonica rice lacked top-quality goods, so ordinary inquiries were more like a flourishing stock price. The situation for Su Tong white japonica rice lacked the beautiful scenery of the north market, only retail sales progressed slightly. The market sentiment opened at 12.4 yuan, similar to the previous disk. Southern Road Qi top-corner Liguli and Chonggu Kiln were stable. Due to news of a poor harvest, these were unable to flourish, with prices still guarding the original disk, and Si Jing Jing and other Baige varieties sold poorly. Liquor demand was not smooth, and the market situation was stable. Sheep Du Xian was uniformly strong, but exceptionally high-quality goods were calling for a higher price, opening at 11 yuan, no substantial changes. The arrival of goods was scarce and transactions were quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Customer Xian Stocks Arrive Sparsely <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, customer Xian arrivals were still minimal. After the morning market opened, there were inquiries from Fujian and Guangdong groups and scattered retail investors from the north, and the market atmosphere was very good. However, arrivals were sparse, and entrants were unable to purchase large amounts. The total market only opened at around 1,000 bags of early Jiangxi machine rice at a price of 11 yuan to 10 yuan and 5 jiao 4 fen, which was nearly 0.1 jiao better than the previous market. Late machine rice was at 100 bags, priced at 12 yuan 5 fen. Hunan machine rice was at 250 bags, priced at 15 yuan 1 jiao to 8 jiao. This rice was from a later batch arriving at the port, and the quality was better, so it was welcomed by local customers.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Period Flour Turns Downward, Especially Near-Term <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the current month uniformly turned downward. The current month fell even more sharply due to warehouse receipt issues. Because the Chinese warehouse receipts from the previous month had not yet been cleared, the receiving side still returned them to the exchange. The customer groups had nowhere to go, and this street dared not receive a batch of bottom goods. No one inquired. Therefore, the standard market value had to be settled by many parties, and it opened lower and lower. It was finally heard that the factory itself was hedging and receiving it. The current month hedged out November, but the weakness was not reduced, and the lowest closing price fell to 2 taels 2 qian 4 fen 2 li and a half, nearly 0.5 fen lower than the previous day's highest price. The distant months also softened because the foreign wheat was also lower by 0.2 or 0.3 taels, and the recent period was also lower. Later, the market was even weaker due to the large factories issuing grades. As a result, the current month fell by 0.375 fen compared to the previous day, November fell by 0.125 fen, December fell by 0.1 fen, and February fell by 0.125 fen, and February fell by 0.15 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Futures Wheat Market Fills Shorts and Recovers <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, presented an initial fatigue followed by firmness. When it initially opened, the foreign wheat quotations turned lower, and market sentiment was naturally dampened, falling by 0.2 or 0.3 fen compared to the previous day's closing. Afterward, because the large short accounts intentionally filled the shorts for near and distant periods, their market sentiment was led by the flour seeing a rising image. However, in terms of the future, the flour price is so depressed that the opening price in the month is feared to re-enter a sluggish environment. If this is the case, there is nothing to do. As a result, November/December rebounded by 0.3 fen compared to the previous day, January rebounded by 0.3 fen, and February rebounded by 0.4 fen. The spot wheat market also saw higher prices because the recent arrivals were very quiet, and high-quality goods were even fewer. The existing stocks in the market could not help but become thinner, so medium-quality goods were also gradually driven up. Yesterday, various grades opened again, calling for 0.4 or 0.5 fen. Mingguang Xinchangzhou, Yaowan, and Xuzhou wheat, 1,650 bags, were purchased by Shen Da Xin Da and other factories.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Fluctuations in Overseas Silk Markets <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>In the past week, the Yokohama raw silk market saw prices gradually increase due to the frequent spot sales. The New York factories' telegraphic transfers also saw sharp increases of 30 to 40 taels. The foreign silk market had a hopeful turning point. However, yesterday afternoon, a Yokohama telegram suddenly reported a sharp drop of 30 to 40 yen in Japanese silk during the day, and the New York telegram also did not see a transfer. Overseas silk markets are fluctuating greatly. Both Chinese and foreign silk merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach, and the Shanghai market has also announced a halt.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Wuxi White Silk Factories Transport Large Quantities to Shanghai <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The silk factories in Shanghai and Wuxi jointly went on strike the day before yesterday in protest against the public quantitative inspection agreement. It is estimated that eight out of ten silk factories in Shanghai are closed. Five out of ten factories in Wuxi are closed, and the rest are urgently in need of winding and unwinding silk due to their relations with the foreign houses' silk futures and the inability to store autumn cocoons (semi-baked cocoons) for a long time. They also plan to join the alliance. With the foreign houses' silk market increasingly sluggish, the foreign houses' silk futures have all been wound and unwound. It was decided to continue the closure from the first day of next month. Therefore, the white silk processed by various silk factories in Wuxi is being transported to Shanghai in batches. In recent days, the Beijing-Shanghai train has transported 570 pieces of white silk, preparing to be delivered to various foreign houses today. Yesterday, all the houses transported them to the Commodity Inspection Bureau for public quantitative inspection.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Oil Market: Tung Oil Prices Decline, Market Stagnant <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The peak season for Tung oil sales has passed, and sales are exceptionally quiet across all merchant groups. Only a few Hakka customers are actively purchasing due to silver supply issues, with many pledging existing goods for loans. Total arrivals this month have reached 2,000 pieces. Yesterday, another 500 pieces of Liu Qingfeng brand were reported to have arrived. Currently, foreign firms hold over 15,000 pieces of oil in stock. Supply exceeds demand, and the market is increasingly sluggish. Current prices are: Jiyingfeng Old Brand at 25 taels and 2 mace, Qingyuanfeng at 20 taels, Liu Qingfeng brand at 17 taels and 5 mace, and Wantaihe brand at 17 taels and 4 mace.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Over a Thousand Cases of "Hua Te" Woolen Cloth Fixed <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Since the sharp contraction of exchange rates, with the rate falling from 2 shillings to 1 shilling and 6 or 7 pence, the woolen cloth industry has suffered significant losses. As a result, most merchants are hesitant to place orders with foreign firms. Consequently, the volume of orders placed with foreign firms overseas has decreased substantially recently. However, according to news from foreign firms, over a thousand cases of "Hua Te" woolen cloth have indeed been ordered. The most orders are for products from factories in England and Germany. Mixed-color "Hua Te" woolen cloth accounts for over 400 cases, ranging from 4 shillings and 3 pence to 4 shillings and 7 or 8 pence. Mixed-color and plain, regular blue-grey "Te" woolen cloth each account for about 300 cases, ranging from 3 shillings and 5 or 6 pence to 4 shillings and 2 or 3 pence. It is reported that customers have not selected specific dates for shipment at the end of this year and in January 1931.</p>

<p>Due to the sluggishness of the foreign lead market, Hunan green lead prices have also fallen by several cash units. Although industry members are doing their best to maintain prices, they are powerless against the overall trend. The current selling price is 13 taels and 7 mace and a half, with few transactions. It is reported that 2,000 bars of spot goods arrived yesterday on a Taikoo Dockyard Company vessel, further crowding the market. Therefore, there are concerns that this may affect the standard price.</p>

<h3 id="e225">The Tibet Question <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Bin</p>
<p>Edited by Hua Qiyun</p>
<p>At a time when the great powers are staring covetously at China and actively plotting against our border defenses, any pioneering work concerning Mongolia and Tibet is bound to deeply affect the livelihood of the people of the whole country. It is most distressing that our compatriots lack the courage and organization to make a great determination to investigate or develop these regions. However, the British pay great attention to Tibet, and the Japanese and Russians pay great attention to Mongolia. Their knowledge of these two places is more practical and abundant than ours. Sometimes we even have to use their books as research and reference materials. How shameful is this! Mr. Hua's book calls for a fundamental solution to all important matters concerning our border defenses, which is why such great achievements are presented before our eyes.</p>
<p>The entire book is divided into three parts. The first part is "The Geography of Tibet." The first chapter, "General Discussion of Tibet," focuses on the development of Tibet itself, and is further divided into four sections: (1) The name and situation of Tibet, (2) The area and population of Tibet, (3) The divisions of Tibet, and (4) The important cities of each division. The second chapter, "The Topography of Tibet," describes Tibet's geology, terrain, mountains, rivers, climate, and rainfall. The third chapter, "The Economic Situation of Tibet," describes Tibet's products, industry, commerce, and transportation. The fourth chapter, "The Social Conditions of Tibet," describes the distribution of Tibet's people, their way of life, customs, and etiquette, the relationship between written language and spoken language, as well as education and religion, etc. The fifth chapter, "A Glimpse of the Journey to Tibet," includes more than fifty stations, each with detailed explanations. The sixth chapter, "The Border Defenses of Tibet," describes the important passes of Tibet, the small countries along the border, Pianma, and the Savage Mountain, etc. After reading this part, one can understand the general outline of the entire Tibet, as well as the content of its topography and culture. If we need to acquire all knowledge about Tibet and the location of Tibet's border defenses, we should read this part carefully, so that it can prepare us with many plans for "going to Tibet."</p>
<p>The second part is "The Politics of Tibet," and like the previous part, it is divided into six chapters. The first chapter, "The Relationship between the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties and Tibet," is divided into six sections: (1) The origins of the Tibetan people, (2) The relationship between the Tang Dynasty and Tibet, (3) The relationship between the Song Dynasty and Tibet, (4) The relationship between the Yuan Dynasty and Tibet, (5) The relationship between the Ming Dynasty and Tibet. The second chapter, "The Pacification of Tibet in the Early Qing Dynasty," describes the beginning of the Qing court's communication with Tibet and the Qing court's pacification of Tibet. The third chapter, "The Qing Court's Management of Tibet during the Flourishing Qing Dynasty," describes the origins of the Qing court's management of Tibet and its achievements. The fourth chapter, "The Qing Dynasty's Management of Kangzang in the Late Qing Dynasty," describes the evolution of the boundaries of Xikang, the process of becoming an internal dependency, the content of the county administration, and the advance of troops into Tibet and the Dalai Lama's exile, etc. The fifth chapter, "The Rampancy of Tibetan Bandits against Us since the Republic of China," describes the first internal invasion by Tibetan bandits after the establishment of the Republic of China, the second internal invasion in 1917, and the recent large-scale internal invasion. The sixth chapter, "The Current Situation of Kangzang and the Necessity of Establishing a Province," describes the current situation of Xikang, the current situation of Tibet, and the necessity of establishing a province in Kangzang. After reading this part, one can certainly understand the origins of the Tibetan people and prove the long history of assimilation between China and Tibet. One can also see the historical evolution of the relationship between China and Tibet from the relationship between our country and Tibet throughout the dynasties. Finally, the author explains the necessity of changing it into a province so that imperialism cannot continue to covet it secretly. Of course, this part is as important as the previous one.</p>
<p>The third part is "The Diplomacy of Tibet," which is also divided into six chapters. The first chapter, "Tibet under the Encirclement of the Great Powers," is divided into four sections: (1) The Exploration of Tibet by the Great Powers, (2) The Coveting of Tibet by Britain and Russia, (3) The Conflict between Britain and Russia in Tibet, and (4) The Accommodation between Britain and Russia in Tibet. In this chapter, the author exposes the conspiracies of the two countries, allowing us to thoroughly understand the intentions of red and white imperialism. The second chapter, "The British Vanguard for the Invasion of Tibet," describes the process of the British annexation of Sikkim, the relationship between Britain and Bhutan, Nepal, and the detachment of Myanmar, etc. The third chapter, "The Beginning and End of the Sino-Tibetan-British Negotiations," describes the first armed conflict between Tibet and Britain and the conclusion of the Tibetan-Indian Treaty, the process of concluding the Tibetan-Indian Supplementary Treaty, and the establishment of the Tibetan-Indian Trade Regulations, etc. The fourth chapter, "The Beginning of British Interference in Tibet," describes the beginning and end of the first and second British interferences in China's advance into Tibet. The fifth chapter, "The Simla Conference," describes the proposed disputes over the boundaries in the Simla Conference, the boundary issues after the breakdown of the conference, followed by the boundary issues after the internal invasion by Tibetan bandits and the opinions of all parties on the boundary issues, etc. The sixth chapter, "Recent Negotiations on Tibetan Cases," describes the Tibetan case after Aston's mission to China, the Tibetan case during the Washington Conference and the British Labor Cabinet. At the same time, it talks about the points that Chinese people should pay attention to regarding Tibet thereafter. The author has elaborated on the author's detailed account of the adventures of various countries in Tibet, so that Chinese people know the urgency of their encirclement of Tibet. As for the failure of negotiations with Britain over the years, it is used to clarify Britain's active attempts to plot Tibet and the need for the Chinese people to pay attention to Tibet in order to show the importance of building the border. This point is right at a time when the National Government is striving for construction, and our people can no longer ignore it.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that to save China from poverty, one must resolutely go to the important border defenses. Then Tibet is of course a place worthy of attention, and our determination to go there is not to seek fame and profit, but to embrace the spirit of personal sacrifice and seek permanent happiness for Mongolia, Tibet, and the entire China. Undoubtedly, this relies on the perseverance of enthusiastic people. Under the strong encirclement, we can no longer hesitate. However, the lack of knowledge of Mongolia and Tibet among Chinese people is also an intolerable fact. If we want to know everything about it first, then Mr. Hua's book is really worth recommending, and sincerely hope that readers will pay attention to this issue and regard "going to Mongolia and Tibet" for investigation as the goal.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Silver Shadow <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Hua</p>
<p>By Wang Jiayu</p>
<p>This book is a collection of short stories, divided into eight parts: "Spirochete," "Autumn Rain," "I Can No Longer Love You," "Weariness," "Rainy Night," "Silver Shadow," "Father," and "Baby." Except for the last one, "Baby," they are all lively and powerful love stories.</p>
<p>"Spirochete" is the most brilliant one, breaking through the carnal atmosphere of the fin de siècle and imposing severe punishment. The protagonist, Han Qing, a young man who already has a pure lover, studies in Japan. He is purely and simply a victim who can represent being misled into lust and unable to extricate himself. When he was about to return home from Japan, under some kind of excitement and impulse, he fell in love with a Japanese servant girl and spent two carnal nights with her to his heart's content. Little did he know that after this indulgence, he had already contracted the so-called spirochete. He did not think about it, nor did he care about the pure lover who sincerely loved him, and only knew how to enjoy the pleasure of committing crimes for a while. However, this deeply embedded germ finally accompanied him back home. After returning, he and his pure lover</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>Spent half a month of rosy life. Right after the engagement, the syphilis that he had never expected broke out, and then he deeply regretted it, and his conscience was almost driving him crazy. But on the one hand, he had to hide it from his lover and her mother and go to the hospital for treatment. After his lover knew the source of his illness, not only did she not blame or despise him, but she also comforted him very gently. But he could not bear this humiliation and finally committed suicide the next day. This is the author's punishment for him.</p>
<p>Let's see what the author borrows from Han Qing's mouth: "The Pingmei (that is, his lover) of today is not mine anymore. I am not qualified to love her anymore..."</p>
<p>"I am more despicable than anything else. I am more dirty than anything else. Beauty and happiness in life have nothing to do with me. What is the point of living..."</p>
<p>The author is truly a writer of conscience. How fiercely he despises the criminal protagonist, and how much he respects the sacred god of love. So he buried Han Qing mercilessly.</p>
<p>Here, the author exposes the so-called romantic youths of the fin de siècle who put "sacred love" in front of them as a protective charm, but in fact they are just mixing in a morbid sexual desire. Even more, some bored literati, using a romantic or even decadent tone, write some moanings without illness, monotonous and boring rubbish, harming a group of blind youths. This is truly sad! When the national spirit is declining to this point, we need our youths to turn weakness into strength. Can we sit back and watch the spread of this evil force? The author of this book has already helped us to rescue this crisis.</p>
<p>In the second chapter, "Autumn Rain," I feel that it is too rich in individual hedonism. There is a passage spoken from the mouth of the heroine Zhi Xin that can be used as proof of my observation:</p>
<p>"Ah—what a poetic realm this is. If we two could build three thatched cottages here and live out our lives, I would have no other requests."</p>
<p>This kind of selfish, individualistic idea is just the extravagant hope of people who are immersed in a rosy dream, or of people who are tired of the world and only seek to live out their short lives comfortably. It is the so-called garden of Edenism of our Mr. Tao Qian. However, at least our youths should not have this idea. The burden of the future should belong to our youths. Of course, some people think that love is sacred and supreme, and that everything can be sacrificed for love, as long as love can be fulfilled. But I think that love is not necessarily so sacred and supreme. We only recognize that love is an important part of human life, and we must never use this to determine the entire meaning of life. So we must not prevent love, but we cannot "have no other requests." Perhaps this point was inadvertently slipped from the pen by the author. It was not necessary to nag so much, but I sincerely hope that the author can lead the youths who are trapped in confusion to this bright path.</p>
<p>"I Can No Longer Love You" can be said to be the longest chapter in the book. It mainly describes a literary writer, Li Danru, who once lost his love and developed a disgust for love, and formulated the philosophy of love that "the gift of love is tragedy." But later, under emotional impulse, he once again embarked on the path of love. He fell in love with a woman named Anna. When the two were swimming in the sweet sea of love, a completely romantic Miss Meimei came out. She also passionately pursued Li Danru. As a result, a triangular struggle was formed. But Danru did not love Miss Meimei at all, and even hated her for messing up the relationship between him and Anna. Miss Meimei used all kinds of divisive tactics, but Danru's repeated rejections were useless. Miss Meimei still stubbornly pursued him. Anna became jealous and misunderstood, and then became angry at Danru. So he still took back his previous philosophy of love and cruelly declared to Anna, "I can no longer love you."</p>
<p>This work can be said to be successful in terms of description, but it lacks a central consciousness and is slightly inferior to the first chapter, "Spirochete."</p>
<p>From the short piece "Weariness," we can be told the psychology of a person who is tossed up and down in the waves of love. The author once again used his means of exposure. It turned out that their love was so monotonous, and the highest point of their love was only expressed by kissing and hugging. So the author shouted "boring" for them. The author was able to write such vivid things in such short words, which cannot be regarded as exquisite.</p>
<p>"Two Nights" writes about the lonely psychology of a married woman, because soon after the marriage, her husband separated from her. So she was depressed and sought a place to vent her depression. This led her to pursue her uncle. The uncle is a very lovable young man. She used all means to express herself in front of him, but under the control of his mother, it was impossible. This piece is written very tensely and touchingly.</p>
<p>The content of "Father" seems to be a bit too coincidental. It tells the story of a illegitimate daughter who was abandoned by her father because he belonged to someone else less than four months after her birth. When she was six years old, her mother died. At the age of sixteen, she worked as an actress. Later, her father was able to recognize her in the section of recognizing relatives, using a red mole on the back of her mother's neck as an example. This is an old trick in coincidental stories and does not seem very beautiful.</p>
<p>"Silver Shadow" and "Baby" are also still good.</p>
<p>In summary, this book is a powerful work that can capture the psychology of the characters. However, there is one point that I hope the author will pay attention to: the self-admiration of the loners in the ivory tower is no longer needed in this era. I hope that the author will make further efforts for the nation in the future. This is my sincere hope.</p>
