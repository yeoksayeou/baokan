<p>漢口通信蔣總司令二十三日午前八時親蒞橋口新營房召集武漢北區要塞部隊訓話其辭如下（股司令各團長各官長今天特來檢閱武漢要塞砲兵團和機關槍團因爲現在國内戰事已是結束時整頓砲兵乃是格外緊要事情我們中國的砲兵實在程度太差了各官長對此格外要留心研究力求進步近幾年來因戰事頻仍各部隊長官都没有工夫來研究没有時間來訓練所以砲兵的精神學問學科術科也統統没有進步反而只見退步尤其是在精神方面比其他的部隊均差得多這一點各官長要特别注意外國的砲兵天天研究日有進步各種科學都是一日千里但是中國二十年來却不僅是無進步而且一天退步一天現在我們的砲兵幾乎已成過去的兵種外國　直不用的了各長官要知道若是中國的砲兵再不努力再不振作精神起來如此萎靡下去那末中國將要由此　了今後我們中國作戰的主幹最要緊的兵種便是砲兵現在的砲兵已超過從前步兵的重要了所以砲兵得力與否眞是國家興亡的一個大關鍵如若砲兵的官長不能盡其責任那就對不起國家更對不起革命了希望大家格外留心研究這一點振作精神切實整頓起來然後才不愧爲國民革命軍砲兵團的官長今天對於學科衛科還没有檢閱過僅就今天閱兵所見便可見到我們官長的精神體格差得遠試看外邊的軍隊精神何等飽滿體格何等强壯便是從前的西北軍他們没有發餉且是吃不飽穿不煖的但是他們的官兵而孔却均紅　胸部都能挺出來不像我們現在大家的皮黃骨瘦我看見這一點實在很痛心革命軍人乃是建國的軍隊應該何等健壯西北軍没有發　吃不飽穿不煖然而官兵的面孔很紅是什麽緣故就是他們的官長有訓練能管理調節伙食分配均匀什麽東西都是自已官兵來做天天在那裡　練物質　稍缺乏却有精神來補足所以士兵體格和技能　弄得很好各位反看自己眞是慚愧現在各士兵不强壯就是官長的訓練督率責任没有盡到不能以身作則勤勞刻苦來做士兵的模範我們現在做　命軍人做革命官長决不是從前那樣單只一天出兩頭操早晚點點名就算了我們在出操點名之外還要鍛鍊官長自已的體格精神士兵的體格精神完全要由官長來訓練官長是有此責任的須知一個人的體格不好是最壞的事所以軍隊的學科衛科還在其次最緊的　是在於體格精神的好如若體格精神不好那就不僅不配做軍人並且不配做國民自已做不了人外國人見了還要看輕我們從此以後各官長一定要督率士兵互相砥礪講究體格無論怎樣早起來怎樣冷的天氣一定要勤習體操並且各官長要看得士兵如同子弟一樣决不使子弟做一點壞事他的子弟也就不敢爲非若任他冷着熱着生病漠不關心那就　極了軍隊如同家庭要一樣的顧護其次官長對於砲兵的學術科固然要切實研究而對於各種器械馬匹也要同樣的講究保管從前關於這些地方多是漫不經意那是最不好的了大家知道砲兵是最要緊的兵種並且最難的學問其管理也最難所以砲兵比其他兵種决不可同日而語在經濟方面我們中國同外比較起來差得很遠外國軍隊的馬匹器材是一有定的用度規定用兩年或三年期滿之後方才撤換並不像我中國用過就算了非出操的時候要把所有零件統統擦過士兵刷馬擦馬蹄官長應監督着外國保全器材保管馬匹均是這樣的講究中國是不待說了中國人的弱點就是拿國家的東西不算一件東西甚至將自已的東西也不當一回事隨便濫費亂掉馬匹又瘦又　不成樣子所以有人說中國不僅是做人倒霉做馬也倒霉嗣後我們不但兵要刷馬官長也要刷馬也要拿禾草喂馬才行若要砲兵練好第一便要對馬留心如果馬的力量不夠那砲兵也就没有用處我們從前在日本砲兵隊時不僅是每天要刷馬連馬蹄子下面泥也要挑干淨一點骯　都没有一件件交點完畢回來還要刷自已的靶子這樣成爲習慣所有東西就纔可以保全所以各官長要自已負起責任來時刻留意保管無論那個兵士都使其養成保全器材營養馬匹的習慣一團就是　長的責任一連就是連長的責任能做到這個地步才可成爲好砲兵所以在學術科之外尤須十分注重保全器材營養馬匹如若馬匹不夠或器材不足的時候趕緊調查出來必要練成幾個完好的砲兵團萬一物質缺乏亦可以精神補充希望各官長對此特别注意）（十二月二十三日）</p>

<h3>付之一笑海客</h3>
<p>甲近來我們公司中的經理先生辦事十分認眞對於職員的勤惰特别注意乙那麽你們當職員的未免吃苦了</p>
<p>甲那倒未必最有趣的他印了許多標語遍貼在辦事室中乙這標語說些甚麽</p>
<p>甲很爲簡單只有四個字呌做（立刻就辦）意思是呌人趕快辦公不要延宕不道掛了三天那蓄意捲逃而躊躇未决的會計先生就立刻捲了一萬多塊現鈔逃跑了那秘書先生久已與經理先生的女兒私下相愛也就立刻跑去自由結婚了還有一班久想加薪的下級職員也就立刻提出加薪的要求而以罷工相要挾甲女昨夜我們校裏請了一位甚麽經濟博士舉行演講使我氣得要死</p>
<p>乙女他說些甚麽</p>
<p>甲女竟敢侮辱我們女子</p>
<p>乙女怎麽一回事你不妨說出來聽聽甲女他說（現在世界上有好多國度都是男多於女而我國却是女多於男所以就經濟學的立塲說來應當將我們過剩的女子都移到外國去彼此配合）我聽到這裏就生了氣立刻起身離席不道他見我走開還敢涎着臉說（不過我以爲儘可慢慢的去不必去得這般快）</p>

<h3>耶誕食火雞談履冰</h3>
<p>十二月二十五日之耶誕節凡屬白色人種之國家社會人士莫不興高彩烈舉行慶祝宴會之際耶誕必食布丁且常備火雞一碟此火雞平時不見於食譜而獨耶誕節有之亦殊可異考稽古藉此雞流入英國始於塞特斯丹愷巴軍艦上之某大尉當時名將威廉施屈里克蘭亦曾隨艦遠征多次遂於所佩軍器上刻用火雞以爲標識按其時期當在西曆一千五百五十一年由此可斷定火雞之作爲耶誕食品相沿不過三百餘載之久</p>
<p>火雞之西名爲ＴＵＲＫＥＹ發音頗與土耳其相符在不知者或疑雞屬土産實則不然火雞盛育於北美各地而土耳其境内並不多産其首先發見者又非土耳其人乃赴美之西班牙航海家也至何以有此名稱談者不一迄未能詳或謂雞之鳴聲與土耳其之音相似雖備一說要亦未可深信此外有一事中述者即火雞在十六世紀甚爲名貴主敎克蘭曼氏特發佈諭旨在慶祝耶誕各式筵席祇准一雞不許多宰以一火雞而見諸堂堂文告事亦頗趣似爲留心耶誕典實者所應知也</p>

<h3>勞中的新光一瞬</h3>
<p>勞中自新聞學會成立以後接著便有其壁報（新光）出版了組織方面與上海各大報相似如專電啦選電啦時事要聞啦評論啦文藝啦閒話啦各種新聞啦各欄均設有主編内容實算富裕而新頴而值得我們注意的就是他們能把握時代精神站在民族意識不堅强的中國立塲上來指示青年應怎樣去努力怎樣去發揚我們沮喪不振的民族的意識使沉悶得睡去似的民族蓬蓬勃勃的起來向進化的路上推進　　在上星期六晚（十三日）勞中唱歌隊舉行小音樂演奏會（新光）報上除大登廣告外還特闢（音樂副刋）一欄專登載關於這次演奏會的作品計有編者的我們爲什麽要開這次的音樂會薇傑的（關於音樂）石匠的（新音樂物一般的趨勢）芷痕的（以音樂偉大的力）來唤醒睡去了的民族）松柏的（勞中唱歌隊音樂會演奏曲的介紹等作品都以銳利的眼光眞實的理論流暢的文字來說明音樂對於民族存亡問題及我們生活上的不可刹那分離</p>
<p>的確我們深切地感到暮氣沉沉的民族確是缺乏藝術的灌輸以致使這民族萎糜不振我們看吧音樂知識如此幼稚的我中國便很顯明地呈露著頽喪的民族精神眼光放遠些看吧歐美各國的民族如此活潑有生氣這不能不歸功於音樂的普遍所以音樂的普及在民族文化的進展上是佔非常重要位置的</p>
<p>因爲我們都同樣地急盼著在民族牲如此不堅强的中國極需要藝術之王　音樂　灌注在每個人的心苗的時候我且介紹芷痕的</p>
<p>（以音樂偉大底力來唤醒睡去了的民族）一叚文字於讀者諸君之前</p>
<p>（我們的民族睡去了亟應用音樂的高聲將他們呌醒吧</p>
<p>整個的民族之沮喪消沉而至於失却知覺般的睡去有什麽法子去挽救呢眞的在這憂鬱沉默的空氣中他們是感到寂寞了我們要突破這憂鬱打擾這沉靜消失這寂寞使整個的民族甦醒躍動歡狂起來我們不見到我們民族中的少年少女沮喪暮氣頽唐嗎一大羣一大羣的行屍走肉在死路上徘徊嗎那末我們毫無遲疑的用音樂的熱情去喚醒他們以音樂清凉之水去滌洗他們頽唐的暮氣從根底上消去他們内心的憂鬱與沮喪以音樂的熱血去灌溉使其枯萎了的心田長生氣蓬的花草來大家從死囚國裏跳出以後才知道生之快樂感到死之悲哀滅亡之痛苦纔知道在重重壓迫之下急切地要掙扎和奮鬥要整個民族接受了音樂的温馨的愛情音樂的鼓舞與激盪而後民族才能焕發有生氣因氣我們相信音樂是人類精神上的劇藥）</p>
<p>一個民族这民族性向上進展與否全視該民族丙分子之對於音樂程度與興趣如何而定所以音樂的功效於民族能促進其民族性之向上與發展於個人能養成其高尙的人格</p>
<p>德意志　日耳曼民族雖經此次世界大戰而慘敗然至今仍回復到往昔生氣蓬勃之現象這未始不可以歸功於他們民族内部音樂普及的效</p>
<p>果</p>

<p>(24th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Bandits from Fujian Fleeing into Guangdong Territory</h3>
<p>Shantou. Luo Jieren, the Chief of the Security Corps of Changting, Liancheng, Shanghang, and Yongding, led Zhang Zhenming's troops from Shanghang on the 18th to attack Yongding.

<h3>Scope of Amnesty Based on Plenary Session Resolution</h3>
<p>Nanjing. Regarding the amnesty case, a certain important figure in the judicial circle was recently interviewed. According to him, this amnesty case is based on the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session. The resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session originated from President Chiang's telegram from Jiang. The scope of those to be pardoned was clearly stipulated by the Fourth Plenary Session. The two courts, administrative and judicial, are unable to exceed their scope in sorting out the articles. Recently, there has been much speculation about this case outside, such as the rumor that the sentences of those sentenced to death will be reduced, which is inaccurate. The amnesty for ordinary criminal offenders is a separate issue and cannot be confused with the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session. According to the Organic Law of the National Government, submitting an amnesty case is not within the judicial authority. The judicial branch can only submit a pardon case, not an amnesty case. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Envoy Corps Paying Attention to Likin Abolition</h3>
<p>Beijing. The Envoy Corps is currently concerned about whether the abolition of likin can be thoroughly implemented by the end of the year. The US and British embassies are paying close attention to this. The Japanese believe that business with China is more important in the north than in the south. The Italian and Japanese are also concerned that the consolidated tax bureaus established by the Ministry of Finance to compensate for the abolition of likin are limited to the eleven southern provinces and do not extend to the north, increasing concerns that the abolition of likin in the eight northern provinces will be delayed. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Regulations for Collecting Consolidated Taxes</h3>
<p>Under Review by the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee</p>
<p>Nanjing. The consolidated tax bureaus in various provinces and districts established after the abolition of likin are all limited to start collecting taxes on New Year's Day of the 20th year of the Republic. In addition to cigarettes and wheat flour, which can be levied at the old rates, the three items of cotton yarn, matches, and cement are all newly created. The draft regulations and tax rates are drafted by the Consolidated Tax Bureau and submitted to the Ministry of Finance, which then forwards them to the Legislative Yuan for review. The decision has been made to hand them over to the Finance Committee for review, and they can be passed at the next meeting. The scope of the special taxes being prepared includes six items: timber, porcelain, paper, tea, silk, and cocoons. Fu Yun, the head of the preparation office, has completed the sorting out of the tax system and has dispatched investigators to the eight provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Fujian, Henan, and Shandong. They are expected to return to Nanjing in the next few days to determine the collection plan. During this period of transition between the old and new tax systems, it may be necessary to suspend collection for a few days, but at most it should not exceed ten days. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>County Organization Law to be Completed Within the 20th Year of the Republic</h3>
<p>Nanjing. The Ministry of Interior has stipulated that the completion of the County Organization Law is limited to the 20th year of the Republic, to be implemented uniformly. It has also notified the provinces to instruct the counties that those in the countryside who are of good character, mature, prudent, and knowledgeable can be selected at any time to assist in handling the autonomous regions. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Air Trunk Line</h3>
<p>May be Opened in February of Next Year</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Economic Tide is Growing More Serious</h3>
<p>The trend of global economic panic is growing more serious by the day. It is truly like a river flowing downhill, unstoppable. The number of unemployed people was initially hoped to decrease daily, but now it not only fails to decrease but also increases sharply. The trend of cheap silver was initially hoped to turn around, but now it not only fails to turn around but also falls further. Commerce is increasingly stalled, and people's hearts are becoming more and more uneasy. The authorities of various countries are in a frenzy, all struggling to find a way to remedy the situation, and worry that next year will be even more unbearable. Taking the United States and Germany as examples, the New York Trust Company and Chelsea Bank in the United States have now simultaneously and suddenly suspended operations. These two banks are the backers of the film industry, and their impact is even greater than the successive bank failures in various places. On the one hand, the number of unemployed people is still increasing dramatically. According to investigations, there are now 5.3 million people who have nothing to do. Although the political and business circles are thinking day and night to maintain the situation, there is still no result. The German authorities released unemployment statistics for December 15, totaling 3,977,000 people. The statistics for New Year's Day are feared to far exceed 4 million, and in February they will reach a shocking number. It is said that this chilling state will further fuel party disputes. The government's various efforts have also been ineffective. The only hope for the future is to expect a shift in the world economic situation. The party's inability to handle the situation is already clear. Klein, the Undersecretary of the US Department of Commerce, also said after returning to the country after examining the economy in Europe that he expects unemployment in Europe to reach its peak in January of next year. Other countries in Europe also have the same terrifying picture. If this picture continues to advance without end, it is unknown what kind of immeasurable changes will occur. It is unknown what state the world will be in next year, which is truly difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Jin Army Generals Have No Objections to Downsizing</h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Spending Christmas in Tianjin</p>
<p>Beiping. Zhang Xueliang brought his sons and daughters in Shenyang to Tianjin on the 23rd to spend Christmas in Tianjin, and will return to Shenyang together on the 28th. He originally agreed to discuss with Xu Chuan and Song Changwu, but continued to talk last night due to a temporary stomach discomfort, and changed the discussion to today. Currently, Xu, Song, and others have no objections to downsizing their troops, but hope that Zhang will help with the severance pay. After Zhang carefully reviewed the actual income and expenditure accounts and budget table presented by the Director of the Jin Finance Department, he also deeply understood the economic difficulties of Jin. However, regarding the subsidy for severance pay, he said that he needed to ask the Central Government for instructions. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin. Zhang originally planned to convene the Jin Army and Northwest Army generals on the evening of the 23rd to announce the resettlement plan. However, Zhang ordered the generals to return to their residences due to a cold, and they will be notified by telephone in a few days to come again. Shi Yousan did not depart on the morning of the 24th due to business, and is scheduled to return to Shunde with Fu Zhan Kui on the night of the 24th or the morning of the 25th to inspect his troops. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Arrives in Dalian</h3>
<p>Dalian. Yan Xishan, along with his family and followers, a total of 43 people including Zhao Daiwen, arrived in Dalian on the morning of the 24th at 8:00 AM aboard the Wuchang Maru. After landing, they immediately entered a temporary residence in Heiguanzhuang outside the city. Yan did not mention military or political matters at all. He only told reporters that he plans to stay in Dalian for four weeks and then go to Japan for two months of rest before embarking on a trip to Europe and the United States. Even if the domestic situation changes during the travel period, he will not return to the country. The report in the newspaper that I met with Zhang Xueliang in Tianjin is completely unfounded. It is also not true that Feng Yuxiang went to Tianjin. Feng Yuxiang's current whereabouts are unknown. Wang Jingwei will probably go to Hong Kong. (24th Japanese United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Garrison Troops Continue to Return Seized Trains</h3>
<p>Jinan. Tang Dehua, the special commissioner for train requisition from the Railway Department, has had some of the trains seized by Sun Lianzhong in Jinan and Ningyang returned. Han Yuting has also decided to return the majority of the trains after the New Year, leaving only three armored trains and one special train for bandit suppression and troop transport. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Han Fuqu replied to the Ministry of Railways, acknowledging the receipt of the telegram stating that all vehicles retained on the Jinpu Railway should be returned to the road for acceptance and will be handled accordingly. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Regarding Extraterritoriality Negotiations</h3>
<p>Nanjing. News from diplomatic circles: Regarding the extraterritoriality issue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently submitted a note to the relevant countries. However, because the original text of our counterproposal is very long, it was stated in the note that:</p>
<p>Please give a final reply by February of next year so that they have the opportunity to study. Now that our country is stable and the attitude of various countries towards us has changed slightly, it is expected that a concrete solution can be reached soon. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Training the People Plan</h3>
<p>Nanjing. In order to complete the County Organization Law, the Local Autonomy Special Committee of the Ministry of Interior consulted with the Central Training Department to discuss the plan for training the people in order to handle county autonomy and other matters. It has been decided to: (1) Establish public libraries; (2) Establish public reading rooms; (3) Organize consumer cooperatives, etc. It has been notified to the provincial governments to instruct the counties to prepare for these matters within the deadline. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>New Taxes Levied by Provinces and Cities Must Be Approved by the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Nanjing. Finance Minister Song Ziwen again presented to the National Government that although the business tax after the abolition of likin in various provinces is being actively prepared, there is still no fixed income. On the one hand, he is carefully reviewing the actual financial reforms of various provinces and will provide subsidies to maintain the status quo in the shortest possible time. However, he fears that during this transition period, remote and nearby provinces and cities may, as an expedient measure, change the name to set up organizations similar to likin or levy illegal taxes, which would be detrimental to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Please reissue a clear order strictly ordering all provinces and cities that no matter what new taxes are proposed to be levied or any replacement taxes are proposed to be increased, they shall not be held without being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval in order to emphasize the government's decrees. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Hubei Textile Industries Petition to the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>Nanjing. Li Dazhang and others, representatives of the Jiangsu Textile Industry Association, and Su Cun and others, representatives of the Hubei Textile Factory, called on Minister Kong on the 24th to state the difficulties of the textile industry and request to revise the consolidated tax rates, continue to use silver to pay taxes, and request to follow the precedent of wheat flour subsidies and provide subsidies or allocate several million yuan of public bonds to be distributed to various factories as payment of taxes to provide relief. Key points of the reply: (1) The abolition of likin nationwide results in an annual loss of tens of millions, and it is not certain whether the consolidated tax revenue can reach 40 million. The government has abolished the tax policy of many years, and the industrial sector should support this policy. (2) The development of factories depends on four points: technology, labor, management, and capital. Manufacturers themselves should pay close attention to how to improve technology, coordinate labor-management relations, scientifically manage, and enrich capital. The government is planning to consult with domestic financial circles to designate banks to fully accommodate them. In addition, a commendation method will be formulated so that emerging domestic enterprises can receive full protection and encouragement. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Dai Chuanxian Admonishes Students of Sun Yat-sen University</h3>
<p>Nanjing. Dai Chuanxian telegraphed to all faculty and students of Sun Yat-sen University again on the 22nd, saying that after reading the review committee of Guangdong Sun Yat-sen University, it was forwarded to the students for your appraisal. The representatives sent by the students have been met twice, and I have sincerely told them the government's intentions and the board of directors' determination. The representatives have accepted my intentions. The students should abide by the government's orders, trust the board of directors' arrangements, quickly stop all illegal actions, and study with peace of mind. It is heard that the students are still disregarding right and wrong, disobeying laws and regulations, and becoming more and more intense. They neither obey government laws and regulations nor abide by the board of directors' arrangements. I have also advised them, but they have ignored them. Such perverse behavior is like madness, which is truly pitiful and painful. You must know that only by following justice and fairness can things exist in the world. To bear the name of Sun Yat-sen University, you must believe in the Premier's principle of "everything for the public" and learn the Premier's spirit of self-love and loving others. The students' actions not only harm the school and themselves, but also cut off their own lives and lose the sympathy of the people of the world. I have always loved the university and cannot tolerate this kind of absurd behavior by the students in the slightest. This is my final warning. The students must know that the life of this university exists with the spirit of the Premier forever, and it will never be damaged in the slightest because of the students' absurd and reckless behavior. The government's strict orders to warn students will be enforced starting with Sun Yat-sen University. President Chiang himself is in charge of the Ministry of Education in order to rectify the academic atmosphere. His words will be followed. Students should not be childish and cut themselves off from the school. Crying and admonishing, may each of you obey. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Coal Mine Discovered in Xingcheng</h3>

<h3>Rumor of Feng Yuxiang Arriving in Tianjin in Disguise</h3>
<p>Nanjing. It is rumored here that Feng Yuxiang has arrived in Tianjin in disguise, but this has not yet been confirmed. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>Tianjin. There are reports that Feng Yuxiang arrived in Tianjin on the morning of the 24th. Although this statement is widely spread, important figures do not know his address. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Northwest dignitaries have been waiting in Tianjin for Feng for a long time, but have dispersed in the last two days because he has not arrived. In fact, even Li ***quan does not know Feng's whereabouts. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Liu Shangqing Scheduled to Go to Nanjing Within Days</h3>

<h3>World Unemployment Statistics</h3>
<p>Increasing in Germany and America, No Decrease</p>
<p>Slight Improvement in America</p>
<p>Berlin, December 23rd, National News Agency: German authorities recently released unemployment statistics for December 15th, totaling 3,977,000, an increase of 277,000 from the beginning of the month and nearly 1,600,000 compared to the same period last year. Even during the Christmas season, unemployment cannot be reduced, and the statistics for New Year's Day are expected to far exceed 4,000,000, with even more alarming figures in February. This phenomenon is truly chilling for Germans, who feel the future is dim and are further fueling the power of the Communist Party. However, the German government's various efforts to reduce wages and lower prices have not been very effective. The only hope now lies in the transformation of the world economic situation and the change in the attitude of the great powers towards reparations.</p>
<p>London, December 23rd, National News Agency: The unemployment statistics for December 15th in the United Kingdom have shown a significant decrease. The figure for December 1st was 1,743,000, but it was only 1,299,000 on the 15th. This progressive trend is expected to continue until the next month.</p>
<p>Washington, December 23rd, Associated Press: On Christmas Day, the unemployment situation in the United States is even more serious than before. Both political and business circles are now making every effort to maintain this recession. The American Federation of Labor has issued a statement stating that as of the Christmas holiday, there are 5,300,000 people in the United States who ostensibly have jobs but actually have nothing to do, an increase of 300,000 in the number of unemployed compared to the previous month. However, according to the White House, it has been decided to increase wage rates in various regions to the highest level to alleviate unemployment. The Department of the Army has also announced that it has allocated a special fund of 25 million yuan to improve rivers and riverbanks across the country, thereby relieving unemployment.</p>
<p>New York, December 23rd, Associated Press: Commerce Department Vice President Klein recently traveled to Europe to investigate the economic and industrial situation and returned here today. According to Klein, he expects unemployment in Europe to reach its peak in January. Klein will go to Washington within days to hear the latest report on the unemployment situation in the United States.</p>
<p>Tokyo News: As a result of the global economic downturn this year, the number of unemployed people in various countries has increased dramatically at an alarming rate. According to a recent report on unemployment surveys in various countries released by the Tokyo branch of the International Labor Office, there are currently 11,800,000 unemployed people worldwide, a doubling in the past year. The distribution among countries is as follows (in thousands):</p>
<p>| Country   | 1930 | 1929 |</p>
<p>| :-------- | :---- | :---- |</p>
<p>| Austria  | 19    | 225  |</p>
<p>| France   | 1     |      |</p>
<p>| Germany  | 3252  | 1557 |</p>
<p>| UK       | 1579  | 937  |</p>
<p>| Italy    | 416   | 344  |</p>
<p>| Netherlands | 321   | 12   |</p>
<p>| Poland   | 224   | 159  |</p>
<p>| Soviet Russia| 633  | 1310 |</p>
<p>| Australia| 80    | 40   |</p>
<p>| Canada   | 187   |      |</p>
<p>| Japan    | 261   |      |</p>
<p>| USA      | 4000  |      |</p>
<p>Judging from the above survey, the number of unemployed people in all countries has increased, with the most significant increases in countries such as the UK and Germany, which have doubled. However, Austria and the Soviet Russia have seen a decrease. The decrease in the number of unemployed people in Soviet Russia is particularly noteworthy. As for the future increase or decrease in the number of unemployed people in various countries, all countries believe that it is impossible to prevent it in the short term. The global economic situation in 1931 is likely to be more dangerous, and the development of the unemployment crisis will become the biggest problem in the world. (World)</p>

<h3>Two More New York Banks Collapse</h3>
<p>A Great Disappointment for Christmas</p>
<p>The Film Industry Suddenly Loses a Supporter</p>
<p>New York, December 23rd, Associated Press: The joyful Christmas Day tomorrow is overshadowed by the unfortunate news that Trust Company and Chelsea Bank simultaneously ceased operations today. Following the closure of Philadelphia Bank Trust Company yesterday, Chelsea Bank followed suit today. More than a dozen small banks have closed down across the country.

The impact of the closure of these two banks is difficult to determine at this time. However, these two banks have been the backers of the film industry, and the industry is in great panic after this crisis.</p>

<h3>Japanese Diet Convenes Yesterday</h3>
<p>Electing Ministers and Directors</p>
<p>Declaration of Establishment of Both Houses</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 24th, Japan United Press: The 59th Diet convened today. This is the first Diet since the establishment of the current cabinet to implement various important policies and seek national judgment. Although the government and the party occupy an absolute majority of 267 seats, it is still questionable whether Prime Minister Hamaguchi, who was assassinated, can attend the Diet after the recess. The trends of various factions within the party have been swept away on the surface, but they continue to fight in the dark. Although the Proletarian Party is a minority, it unites the common front, touts exposure tactics, and rises resolutely. Therefore, the day of the convocation of the Diet saw tension in both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives. The bell rang at 9 am to convene the meeting, and after deciding on the department heads of each faction, the ministers and directors were elected. The secretary reported the results, and the speaker declared the establishment.</p>

Negotiations in the Diet are handled exclusively by Makiyama, and Yabe and Kimura are responsible for the allocation committee. When the war of words becomes fierce, the chiefs such as Tomi, Iwaihara, and Sakura will consult with the cabinet members and entrust the control to Interior Minister Adachi to establish a strategy to overcome the difficulties. There will only be preliminary clashes this year and no major waves. With the power of an absolute majority, the Constitutional Democratic Party intends to monopolize the chairmen of all committees and standing committees in the Diet. In actual combat, it intends to defeat the attacks of the opposition party in one fell swoop.</p>
<h3>The Strategy of the Seiyukai</h3>
<p>Tokyo, December 24th, Electric Communication Agency: The opposition party, the Seiyukai's, preparation for attack is mainly based on the countermeasures to open up the economy that have been researched by the party's Political Affairs Research Council. President Inukai himself will stand at the forefront and use this weapon as a means of attack. Other issues, such as the military reduction issue, the Musha incident, and the Kobashi issue, are all specifically targeted at attacking the government. The chief secretary in the Diet is actually in charge of the affair by Mochizuki. Hatoyama, Akita, Uchida, Mori, etc. will assist the director inside and outside the Diet. With an impeccable system, they will do their best to overthrow the cabinet.</p>
<h3>The Rise of the Proletarian Party</h3>

The Muslim female representative, Ms. Nawaz, asked her Indian compatriots to regard Muslims as comrades and treat each other with tolerance. She also asked her Muslim compatriots not to expect too much, and to show the Indian Hindus the Muslim way of knowing tolerance. The Hindu female representative, Ms. Subhasiyam, then rose to speak, urging the representatives to understand their responsibility to future generations and to resolve their unfortunate disputes.

<p>It will not be continued after its expiration</p>
<p>Amsterdam, December 23rd, National News Agency: Rotterdam Catholic newspaper published a dispatch from Brussels predicting that the Franco-Belgian military alliance will not be continued after its expiration, because the Belgian political circles are deeply dissatisfied with the new military equipment and new fortresses stipulated in the agreement, which increase the huge burden on the national treasury. The two major liberal newspapers in Brussels will advocate opposition to this agreement, because since the establishment of the Locarno Treaty, the agreement has become useless. The Catholic newspaper also commented on this matter, saying that the Belgian-French military alliance has long been a threat to European peace, but once it is abolished, it will open the way for Belgium to return to a neutral policy, so the forces supporting the abolition of the agreement are growing stronger.</p>

The authorities are continuing to arrest those in various places who are suspected of participating in the revolution or being involved in it. Although there are no official statistics on the total number of arrests, it is currently estimated to be over 2,000.</p>
<h3>Disaster Situation of Mount Merapi Eruption</h3>
<p>Villages destroyed by lava flows</p>
<p>Survey estimates more than 800 deaths</p>
<p>The Hague, December 23rd, Reuters: The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies recently reported that the eruption of Mount Merapi in Central Java has completely or partially destroyed a total of forty villages hit by lava flows. Residents of other villages have mostly fled. Hundreds of cattle have died, and agricultural crops have suffered significant damage.</p>
<p>Batavia, December 24th, Reuters: According to a survey of the eruption of Mount Merapi, the death toll is now 800, and there are approximately 24,000 refugees. The exact number of deaths cannot be determined by government officials because the poisonous gas is so pervasive that people cannot enter. There are also a number of isolated villages whose residents have been rescued, thanks to heavy rain that cooled the lava and allowed people to cross. The temperature of the lava after flowing out of the crater reaches 1,350 degrees.</p>

<h3>After Commander-in-Chief Chiang Arrived in Hankou</h3>
<p>Hankou Communications: Since Commander-in-Chief Chiang arrived in Hankou on the 21st, he has been meeting with representatives from all walks of life, feasting senior generals, and inspecting troops and appointing personnel for three days. The situation of the past few days is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection of Fortress Troops: Commander-in-Chief Chiang went to the new barracks in Qiaokou at 8 a.m. on the 23rd to inspect the Wuhan Northern District Fortress Troops. Fortress Commander Yin Zusheng, 16th Route Commander Xu Yuanquan, 21st Route Commander Xia Douyin, Hankou Mayor Liu Wendao, and others accompanied him. After a brief rest at the Fortress Headquarters, they took six cars directly to Qiaokou. They summoned all the officers and soldiers to give a speech for about two hours before finishing. Then, they went to the regimental headquarters of the 1st Artillery Regiment to inspect the internal affairs. They returned to the headquarters at 12 noon. After arriving at the headquarters, he immediately ordered the expansion and reorganization of the unit to be renamed the Wuhan Fortress Headquarters. The 1st Independent Artillery Regiment directly under the Central Government, Yao Yong'an's unit, the 2nd Artillery Regiment, Quan Yueqing's unit, and the 3rd Artillery Regiment, Li Bankui's unit, were all transferred to the command of the Fortress Headquarters. The original fortresses were changed to machine gun regiments, in addition to a communications battalion, a mortar battalion, and two infantry battalions. The organization must be completed by the end of the year. Yin Zusheng will be the commander, and the seal will be issued by the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters. It will be issued by Nanjing and received in Hankou within a week. Meeting with Military and Political Figures: After Commander-in-Chief Chiang inspected the fortress troops and returned to the headquarters, he met with various military and political figures in Wuhan at 1 p.m., including former 8th Army Commander Ye Kaixin, 11th Division Commander Chen Cheng, 3rd Training Division Commander Qian Dajun, 4th Route Headquarters Chief Counselor Wang Dazhen, 4th Route Headquarters Representative in Hankou Hu Xiehuai, Hunan Provincial Government Member Song Heken, Independent 5th Brigade Commander Zhong , 155th Brigade Commander of the 52nd Division Sun Changjun, 2nd Brigade Commander of the 3rd Training Division Li Jilan, Sichuan Party Affairs Investigator Zhou Suichu, etc. During the meeting, Chiang asked each department and local situation in detail and gave</p>
<p>instructions. At that time, Wu Xingya, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Hubei Province, paid a visit to report on the politics of Hubei Province and requested leave to travel abroad to investigate everything due to the difficult environment. Chiang immediately comforted him and said that the central government was relying on him heavily and that he should not be discouraged due to the difficult environment. Moreover, Hubei is located in a crucial position and is currently in the period of suppressing bandits. Without a wise and capable Director of the Civil Affairs Department engaged in the implementation of political training, it would be impossible to clear the source of trouble and seek the welfare of the people. He should continue to work hard in the future. If there are difficulties, the National Government and the Executive Yuan will be able to find ways to resolve them. Wu resigned after listening to the instructions.</p>
<p>Sending a Plane to Welcome Liu Xiang: Liu Xiang, commander of the 21st Army, was originally scheduled to come to Hankou on the 22nd to pay respects to Commander-in-Chief Chiang. However, due to a false rumor from Chongqing that Commander-in-Chief Chiang had returned to Nanjing from Jiangxi, he cancelled his trip. Now that he has heard the accurate news, he plans to depart from Sichuan and telegraphed Hankou on the 23rd to ask Commander-in-Chief Chiang for instructions. Commander-in-Chief Chiang was very happy to receive the telegram. However, because the Shu Road is difficult and it would take five or six days to arrive, and he himself needs to return to Nanjing urgently and cannot wait for a long time, he telegraphed the Nanjing Aviation Department to send a plane to Hankou to transfer to Yichang to welcome Liu. The Aviation Department followed the order and sent a plane to Hankou at 3 p.m. that day, which was parked at the Wangjiadun Airport, waiting to receive the telegram of Liu's arrival in Yichang before flying to welcome and carry him to Hankou.</p>
<p>Xu Yuanquan Appointed to an Important Position: The 48th Division and 44th Division of the 16th Route Commander Xu Yuanquan were ordered to be stationed in western Hubei. It was rumored last month that they would enter Sichuan and Hunan, but it has not been realized. The bandit communists in Huangpi and Xiaogan in northern Hubei and Huang'an and Macheng in eastern Hubei are rampant, so they were ordered to first divide their troops to suppress them. The 48th and 44th Divisions have successively defeated them, and then they followed the original plan to be stationed in western Hubei. All bandit suppression troops in western and southern Hubei are under Xu's command. He Chengjunn, the director of the Headquarters, believed that Xu had made great contributions and shouldered this important responsibility, so he originally planned to request Commander-in-Chief Chiang to grant him the title of Commander of the Bandit Suppression in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River, but Xu firmly declined. Commander-in-Chief Chiang arrived in Hankou and still ordered Xu's troops to be stationed in western Hubei, taking into account Sichuan and Hunan. On the 23rd, he clearly ordered Xu to be the Director of Bandit Suppression and Village Clearing in the Border Areas of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei. Xu could no longer decline and agreed to take office within days. As soon as Commander-in-Chief Chiang leaves Hankou, he will rush to western Hubei. The location will still be set in Shashi. Zhao Guantao will be appointed as the commander of the Zhengzhou Garrison.</p>
<p>Representatives from Shanxi and Hunan Petition: The Shanxi Association of Fellow Townsmen in Hankou and various merchant groups publicly appointed Shi Chengzhi as a representative on the 23rd to petition Commander-in-Chief Chiang to issue a clear order from the National Government for Kong Xiangxi to return to Shanxi to handle the aftermath and appoint him as the chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government so that the people of Shanxi Province can be relieved of their suffering as soon as possible. The Hunan Association of Fellow Townsmen in Hankou was very enthusiastic in driving away He Jian. On the 22nd, they organized a Save Hunan Petition Group to petition Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Chiang, considering the large number of people, found it inconvenient to meet with them and ordered them to appoint representatives to meet with him the next day. On the afternoon of the 23rd, the Hunan Association of Fellow Townsmen appointed Shu Zhaoxiong, Chen Junfang, Kuang Junyu, Zhi Tao, Zixing and others as representatives to go to the headquarters again to petition. Shao Lizi met with them on behalf of Chiang. Shu and others stated the purpose of the petition, requesting the dismissal and punishment of He Jian to apologize to the people of Hunan. Shao promised to forward the message to the Commander-in-Chief. The representatives then left. (December 23rd)</p>
<h3>General Chiang's Address to the Wuhan Fortress Troops</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: At 8:00 AM on the 23rd, General Chiang personally visited the new barracks in Qiaokou and addressed the Wuhan Northern District Fortress troops. His speech was as follows: (Commanders, regimental commanders, and officers, I have come here today specifically to inspect the Wuhan Fortress Artillery Regiment and Machine Gun Regiment because, now that the domestic war is coming to an end, the reorganization of the artillery is an especially important matter. The standard of our Chinese artillery is truly too poor, and all officers must pay special attention to this, research diligently, and strive for progress. In recent years, due to frequent wars, commanders of all units have not had the time to study or train. As a result, the morale, knowledge, and skills of the artillery have not improved; on the contrary, they have only regressed. Especially in terms of morale, it is much worse than other units. All officers must pay particular attention to this. Foreign artillery is studied every day and progressing rapidly. All sciences are advancing by leaps and bounds, but in China, not only has there been no progress in the past twenty years, but it has regressed day by day. Our artillery has almost become an obsolete branch of the military that foreign countries no longer use. All commanders must understand that if the Chinese artillery does not strive and invigorate its spirit and continues to be so sluggish, then China will be ruined. From now on, the most important branch of the military for our Chinese operations will be the artillery. The importance of artillery now surpasses that of the infantry. Therefore, whether the artillery is effective or not is truly a major key to the rise and fall of the nation. If the officers of the artillery cannot fulfill their responsibilities, then they will be letting down the nation and the revolution. I hope that everyone will pay special attention to this, invigorate their spirits, and earnestly reorganize, so that they will not be ashamed to be officers of the National Revolutionary Army Artillery Regiment. Today, I have not yet inspected the academic and hygiene aspects. Judging from today's review alone, it can be seen that the morale and physical fitness of our officers are far behind. Look at the morale and physical strength of the troops outside. Even the former Northwest Army, who were not paid and did not have enough to eat or wear, had officers and soldiers with ruddy complexions and chests that could be thrust out. Unlike us now, everyone is thin and emaciated. Seeing this, I am truly heartbroken. Revolutionary soldiers are the army for building the nation and should be so strong. The Northwest Army was not paid and did not have enough to eat or wear, but the faces of the officers and soldiers were ruddy. What is the reason? It is because their officers have training, can manage and regulate food distribution evenly, and everything is done by their own officers and soldiers, training there every day. Although the material is slightly lacking, it is supplemented by spirit, so the physical fitness and skills of the soldiers are well taken care of. All of you should look back at yourselves and feel ashamed. The reason why the soldiers are not strong now is that the officers have not fulfilled their responsibilities of training and supervision and cannot lead by example and work hard to be models for the soldiers. We are now revolutionary soldiers and revolutionary officers, and we are definitely not like before, simply doing two drills a day, morning and evening roll calls. In addition to drills and roll calls, we must also exercise the physical and mental strength of the officers themselves. The physical and mental strength of the soldiers depends entirely on the training of the officers. Officers have this responsibility. It must be understood that poor physical condition is the worst thing, so the academic and hygiene aspects of the army are secondary. The most important thing is good physical condition and morale. If the physical condition and morale are not good, then not only are you not fit to be soldiers, but you are also not fit to be citizens. If you cannot be people yourselves, foreigners will look down on us. From now on, all officers must supervise the soldiers, encourage each other, and pay attention to physical fitness. No matter how early or how cold the weather, you must diligently practice gymnastics, and all officers must regard the soldiers as their own children and never allow their children to do anything wrong. Then their children will not dare to do evil. If you let them get cold or hot and get sick and are indifferent, then it is extremely wrong. The army is like a family and should be cared for in the same way. Secondly, officers must earnestly study the academic and technical aspects of artillery, and they must also pay attention to the maintenance and care of various equipment and horses. In the past, these areas were often taken lightly, which is the worst thing. Everyone knows that artillery is the most important branch of the military and the most difficult science to learn, and its management is also the most difficult. Therefore, artillery cannot be compared with other branches of the military. In terms of economics, we in China are far behind foreign countries. The foreign armies have fixed usage regulations for horses and equipment, stipulating that they will be replaced after two or three years. Unlike China, where they are used and discarded. When not in training, all parts must be wiped, the soldiers must brush the horses and clean the horses' hooves, and the officers must supervise. Foreign countries pay such attention to maintaining equipment and caring for horses. There is no need to say anything about China. The weakness of the Chinese is that they do not treat national property as something important, and even their own property is not taken seriously. They waste and discard things carelessly. The horses are thin and don't look like anything. Therefore, some people say that the Chinese are not only unlucky as people, but also unlucky as horses. From now on, not only the soldiers must brush the horses, but the officers must also brush the horses and feed them grass. If you want to train the artillery well, the first thing is to pay attention to the horses. If the strength of the horses is not enough, then the artillery will be useless. When we were in the Japanese artillery team, not only did we have to brush the horses every day, but we also had to pick the mud under the horses' hooves clean, without any dirt. After handing over each piece of equipment, we had to brush our own targets. Once this becomes a habit, all things can be preserved. Therefore, each officer must take responsibility and pay attention to the maintenance and care at all times, so that every soldier develops the habit of preserving equipment and nourishing horses. A regiment is the responsibility of the regimental commander, and a company is the responsibility of the company commander. Only by doing this can you become good artillerymen. Therefore, in addition to the academic and technical aspects, you must also pay great attention to preserving equipment and nourishing horses. If there are not enough horses or insufficient equipment, investigate it immediately and be sure to train several intact artillery regiments. Even if there is a lack of material, it can be supplemented by spirit. I hope that all officers will pay special attention to this.) (December 23rd)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues Order to Abolish Likin Tax by Deadline</h3>
<p>All National Collection Agencies to Comply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance issued instructions to the financial commissioners, financial bureaus, railway freight tax bureaus, municipal financial bureaus, customs supervisors, Inspector General of Customs, parcel post tax bureaus, and ordinary customs supervisors of all provinces, stating: "It has been decided by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee and promulgated by decree of the Executive Yuan transferred to the Ministry of Finance for faithful compliance with the case of the implementation of abolishing Likin and all taxes and duties similar to Likin throughout the country from January 1, 1931, and no province shall request an extension for any reason. Now that the deadline is approaching, it is imperative to strictly abide by the implementation of all Likin taxes and unified taxes, unified donations, special taxes, commodity taxes, railway freight taxes, parcel post taxes, octroi, and various taxes and duties in the country that contain the nature of Likin, as well as the ordinary customs duties within fifty li of the customs and other inland ordinary customs duties (excluding national border import and export taxes collected on land borders), transit duties, and re-import duties, etc., shall be abolished forever by December 31 of this year. It must be understood that the Likin system was originally established as an expedient measure, but later it became more and more severe, and various miscellaneous taxes and levies similar to Likin appeared in layers, harming the country and oppressing the people, causing ridicule at home and abroad, and gradually becoming a source of all evils. In order to realize the policy of innovation and relieve the suffering of the people, the government will fundamentally eliminate this long-standing malpractice, comply with the teachings of the late Premier, adapt to the needs of the times, and formulate a good tax system to start afresh with the people. The units concerned should quickly complete the work by the deadline and report it. From January 1, 1931, the above-mentioned collection agencies shall not exist in any form. Anyone who uses deceptive words to delay, falsely establishes names, obeys in appearance but violates in reality, or pursues selfish interests will be considered to be deliberately sabotaging the party and the state's major plans. The law is in place and will not be leniently applied. Let each unit comply and limit the order to be known to the public on the date of arrival. This order."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Takes Over Shanghai-Chefoo-Taku-Tientsin Line</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Chefoo-Taku-Tientsin line was taken back by our country and is now being operated independently. Previously, the Ministry of Communications and representatives of the Great Northern Telegraph Company and Great Eastern Telegraph Company reached a resolution that, starting from the 22nd of this month, the Ministry of Communications would send personnel to take over. The ministry had previously telegraphed the directors of the telegraph bureaus in Shanghai, Tientsin, Chefoo, and Peiping, instructing them to make thorough preparations. The ministry also appointed Chen Xizeng, director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, Shen Fuhai, chief engineer of the cable line, and Chen Wende, business director, as the receiving personnel for Shanghai; Ge Deyin, director of the Chefoo Telegraph Bureau, Gong Mingyu, chief accountant of foreign accounts, and Chen Hongsheng, business director, as the receiving personnel for Chefoo; Zhao Mantao, director of the Tientsin Telegraph Bureau, and Li Jiqing, business director, as the receiving personnel for Tientsin; and Wu Yintang, director of the Peiping Telegraph Bureau, and Pan Chengjiong, business director, as the receiving personnel for Peiping. Yesterday (the 22nd), they began to receive the equipment, materials, furniture, etc., item by item in their respective locations. At the same time, they also telegraphed the Great Northern Telegraph Company and Great Eastern Telegraph Company to inform them of the above situation for verification. The land connection line from Tientsin to Peiping (except for the section from Peiping to Kalgan, which was borrowed solely by the Great Northern Telegraph Company and has already been returned to China for its own use) was also taken over at the same time. The telegraph bureaus in various locations have already acted accordingly, but the procedures are quite cumbersome and will take several days to complete. It is reported that the approximately three million yuan in fees has also been returned to the Great Northern Telegraph Company and Great Eastern Telegraph Company.</p>
<h3>Yen Hsi-shan Has Left Tientsin</h3>
<p>To Spend the New Year in Dairen Before Going to Japan and Then to Europe and America</p>
<p>Tientsin Dispatch: Yen Hsi-shan secretly came to Tientsin on the 30th of last month. His family members and entourage also arrived one after another. In Tientsin, he rented a house at No. 14 Fushimi Street in the Japanese Concession as a temporary residence. The house was quite beautiful, seemingly indicating that he would not be leaving for a while. Later, his father sent a telegram from Shansi urging him to travel abroad to avoid the dangers of residing in the country. Recently, Shang Chen, Hsu Yung-chang, Yang Ai-yuan, Chuan Tso-yi, Sung Che-yuan, Pang Ping-hsun, and others all came to Tientsin one after another at the invitation of Chang Hsueh-liang to discuss the aftermath of the Northwest and to break off relations with Yen. During his fifty-odd days in Tientsin, Yen had no other activities besides refusing visitors. After Chang Hsueh-liang returned to Tientsin, he only sent Wang Shu-chang as a representative to visit Yen to express his regards. Yen also sent Cui Ting-hsien as a representative to express his gratitude. Because their positions were different, they both felt that there was no need to meet in person.</p>
<p>Yen, after repeated telegrams from his father, decided to first go to Dairen for the New Year and then go to Japan. He decided to leave Tientsin on the 22nd on the Japanese Osaka Shosen Kaisha's Wuchang Maru. The ship's dock was originally in the Special Area, but for the convenience of Yen boarding the ship, it was changed to the Fourth Road riverbank in the French Concession. The Japanese Concession Police, together with the French Police, sent more than ten policemen to protect the dock and drive away idlers. Yen's family members boarded the ship first at 3:45 AM, and their luggage was transported in three freight cars. The name signed on the passenger list was Jin Rixin, and a total of twelve first-class cabins were booked. After the family members boarded the ship, they arranged their bedding and placed their luggage. Then, Ning Chao-wu, a member of the entourage, returned to Fushimi Street to report to Yen. Nan Gui, Li Hong-wen, Tseng Yen-yi, Su Ti-ren, Chuan Tso-yi, Wen Shou-quan, Cui Ting-hsien, and others came to see him off. Yen arrived at the dock by car at 1:40 AM. Zhao Dai-wen, Sun Huan-lun, and Liang Ru-zhou came with him. After Yen boarded the ship, he said goodbye to the people who came to see him off in the reception room. The reporter boarded the ship to request an audience with Yen and was invited into the reception room. Yen said that he originally planned to go directly to Japan, but because the New Year was approaching, there would inevitably be many social engagements in Japan, so he would first stay in Dairen for a short time, about two or three weeks. After the New Year, he would go to Korea and Japan. He would stay in Japan for a maximum of three months and then go to Europe and America to investigate various aspects of politics, culture, and industry in various countries, and he planned to ask scholars from the countries he visited to lecture on everything. The reporter further asked if he had any opinions to express. Yen replied that he had nothing to express at the moment. He had been in Tientsin for many days and had repeatedly received visits from Chinese and foreign reporters, but he had not been able to meet them all. He had already sent letters to the various news agencies to express his gratitude. At this point, the reporter said goodbye and left. Yen's expression seemed very pleased and his body was healthier than when he first arrived in Tientsin. Those traveling with him were Zhao Dai-wen and Liang Ru-zhou. In addition, there were several members of the entourage, including Song Che, his second wife, his second and fourth sons, his cousin Xi-qi, a wet nurse, and servants, totaling about thirty people. In order to facilitate his investigation, Yen had assigned tasks to the members of his entourage. Song Che was responsible for translation, Sun Huan-lun was responsible for editing documents, and Li Xiu-zhong, Ning Chao-wu, Wang Huai-qi, Zhang Jin, and others were responsible for investigation. Sun Huan-lun, Su Ti-ren, and Bo Yong-ji planned to take another ship to Dairen. The Wuchang Maru sailed at 4:00 AM this morning and will arrive in Dairen tomorrow morning. Yen's letter to the various newspapers is attached below: (I am deeply grateful to the gentlemen of the Chinese and foreign press for visiting me during my stay in Tientsin. I was unable to meet them all, and I apologize. I have retired from public life and have been refusing visitors. I hope you will forgive me. I have now decided to leave Tientsin today and travel to Dairen and then to Europe and America. I am aware of my limited abilities, but I am fortunate to have the leisure to personally experience the cultures of both oceans. I will enjoy the rest of my life and will do my best to contribute to the Chinese people when I have learned something from my travels in the future. I am sending this to you and wish you all the best. Yen Hsi-shan, December 22nd, in travelling attire.)</p>

<h3>Shantung Armies Ordered to Reduce Strength</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: In order to unify the overall situation, the central government has issued an order to the military authorities in various regions to reduce the size of their forces and strengthen their personnel. The Shantung garrison has received the telegram and is currently preparing to reduce its strength. According to sources from the First Army Corps Headquarters, the central government has telegraphed that the Third Route Army should be reduced to two Class A infantry divisions and one Class B infantry division, and the 15th Route Army, Ma Hung-kuei's force, should be reduced to one Class A infantry division and one brigade. This order must be obeyed. However, the Third Route Army feels that the reduction is difficult. The central government's telegram originally stipulated that a Class A division should consist of three brigades and six regiments, and a Class B division should consist of two brigades and six regiments. Later, it was ordered that a Class A division should consist of two brigades and six regiments, and a Class B division should consist of three brigades and six regiments. The Third Route Army has now telegraphed the central government to inquire. This is not a difficult problem, because the regulations only reduce the number of brigade commanders by two. The most difficult problem is the demobilization expenses and the placement of officers. According to the central government's regulations, each division has six regiments, and three divisions have a total of eighteen regiments, totaling more than 42,000 people. The Third Route Army has eleven regiments in the 20th Division, nine regiments in the 22nd Division, ten regiments in the 29th Division, four regiments each in the 73rd and 74th Divisions, and two regiments in the pistol brigade, totaling forty regiments, totaling more than 60,000 people. When the reduction is implemented, more than 20,000 people must be demobilized, and the required demobilization expenses are currently unavailable. After the reduction, three divisions (originally five divisions) and the officers of the two demobilized divisions must be planned for placement, which is currently impossible. However, the reduction is a firm policy of the central government to reorganize the military. No matter how difficult it is, it must be obeyed. The issue of the division commanders after the reduction is currently being actively prepared. It has already been internally decided that the division commanders will be Sun Tung-hsuan, commander of the 12th Army, Tsao Fu-lin, commander of the 14th Army, and Ku Liang-min, commander of the 22nd Division. The remaining division commanders will be reassigned as brigade commanders. This has been largely decided, but how to reduce the strength has not yet been announced. It is also heard that Ma Hung-kuei's force originally had eighteen regiments, totaling more than 20,000 people, and that about 10,000 people must be demobilized in the future. (23rd)</p>
<h3>Recent Contacts in Kwangsi</h3>
<p>Wei Jung-chao and Ma Hsiao-chun's Trip to Nanning and the Circumstances</p>
<p>Pai Chung-hsi Expresses His Attitude; Ma Hsiao-chun Comes to Canton</p>
<p>Canton Dispatch: The Kwangsi war has been quiet for a long time, and those who are concerned about the situation in the southwest want to know how the front-line war situation is. According to a regimental commander from the front line in Litang, there are currently 5,000 troops from Chang Fa-kuei's Kwangsi army in the Nanning area, and their luggage and supplies have been moved to Lungchow. Military leaders such as Chang Fa-kuei, Yang Teng-hui, Li Tsung-jen, and Huang Shao-hsiung are all in Liucheng, and only Pai Chung-hsi is in Nanning to preside over Kwangsi affairs. His troops have spread out defensive structures outside the northeast gate of Nanning, and the troops are hiding in the valleys south of Wuming to prevent air raids. Liang Han-sung's unit of the Kwangsi army has two regiments stationed on the Litang-Tungkuei County road. The Chang Fa-kuei's Kwangsi army has been in extreme difficulty recently. Since the defeat in Hunan and its return, the soldiers have not been paid for many months, and they are only paid seven yuan and two jiao per month for food. Recently, the weather has turned cold, and military blankets and cotton clothing have not yet been added. Each soldier is only issued one padded blanket and one padded coat, and ammunition is also extremely scarce. Upon inspection, each person only carries fifty rounds of ammunition, and those who cannot bear hunger and cold often desert with their weapons. In this military relaxation, the atmosphere of peace is gradually becoming stronger. It is heard that the peace talks are in progress, and the Chang Fa-kuei's Kwangsi army is very hopeful, but there are still unresolved issues on the conditions. Huang Shao-hsiung has taken the lead on the Kwangsi army's side. The conditions proposed by Huang and his expression of retirement have been disclosed in the newspapers. Recently, Huang sent Huang Chien-ming, the former political director of the 15th Army, as a representative to Canton to visit the military and civilian authorities of this province and a certain gentleman residing in Canton to convey Huang Shao-hsiung's views. The general conditions proposed by the Kwangsi army are as follows: (1) The Kwangsi army will be reorganized by Huang; (2) the Kwangtung army will retreat to Kwangtung; (3) Huang Shao-hsiung will concurrently hold the Kwangsi government; (4) the Kwangsi Provincial Committee will be filled with pure Kwangsi elements. Although the conditions were proposed by Huang's representative in this way, whether they can be implemented remains to be discussed. It is said that Huang Shao-hsiung has decided to retire in order to create a basis for mediating peace. He will take the route through Haiphong to Hong Kong during the day in order to negotiate all matters, and he may even go to Nanking in person if necessary. However, it is heard that Huang's attitude still insists on the goal of entering and governing Kwangsi.</p>
<p>As for Wei Jung-chao and Ma Hsiao-chun, who were sent to Nanning by the Eighth Route Army to take over the administration, they have now returned to Wuchow from Nanning. According to their account of their trip to Nanning, when they arrived in Nanning on the 25th of last month, they were first received by the Kwangsi army division commanders Huang Hsu-chu and Liang Chao-chi, who treated them very warmly. Not long after, Li Tsung-jen, Huang Shao-hsiung, Pai Chung-hsi, Chang Fa-kuei, and others also arrived in Nanning and held a meeting. During the meeting, Ma Hsiao-chun announced the virtues and intentions of the central government and discussed methods for Kwangsi's peace. Li and others expressed their support for this move and said that because of various reasons, they had to put forward several conditions. If the central government could be lenient in the past and resettle their troops, then individual retirement would not be a problem. After the meeting, they feasted for several nights and then parted ways. Before leaving, they saw Huang He-ling's troops holding a sports meeting in Nanning city. The slogan "Promote Peace Between the Two Kuangtung and Kwangsi Provinces" was posted in the arena, which shows that there are people in the Kwangsi army who yearn for peace. When they were about to leave, Pai Chung-hsi had a handwritten letter instructing them to convey it to a certain gentleman. The general idea of the original letter was roughly as follows: "Brothers Chao-yung (Wei Jung-chao) and Chan-hung (Ma Hsiao-chun) came to Nanning and received your teachings again. I admire your concern for us and for the overall situation. Your elegant intentions are beyond words. Over the years, the war has caused public and private difficulties, and people are not made of wood or stone and cannot but feel heartache. However, what we have been fighting for is purely a disagreement on political views and is definitely not personal hatred. Recently, it has been rumored that the central government has summoned a national conference. Then, perhaps what we have been fighting for for years will be realized. As for personal departure, I have never had it in mind since the beginning. I am afraid that I will not be able to unload my responsibilities early. You have seen my heart for many years. How dare I not obey your teachings? I will immediately convey your message to my brothers Chi-kuan (Huang Shao-hsiung) and Hsiang-hua (Chang Fa-kuei) so that they will not fail your respect. I am grateful for your teachings and am presenting my sincere feelings. I am asking my brothers Chao and Chan to convey my respects and to respectfully ask for Chung-an, Pai Chung-hsi, and I am asking De-gong (Li Tsung-jen) to attach a note to express my regards." Yesterday, I heard that the Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Route Army had telegraphed Ma Hsiao-chun to come to Canton for a face-to-face meeting in order to learn the truth of the matter. Ma has replied by telegram that he will start his journey to Canton today. (December 19th)</p>
<h3>Chang Chen's Division Recaptures Lungyen</h3>
<p>Continuing the Attack on Yungting</p>
<p>Amoy Dispatch: For a long time, Chu and Mao had made western Fukien their base camp. For more than two years, they would flee far away when there was an opportunity and return when they failed. As a result, Lungyen and Yungting had been red for more than two years. Therefore, Chairman Chiang specifically ordered the various armies in Fukien Province to actively prepare to attack western Fukien and ordered Chang Chen of the 40th Division to be responsible for the operation. Chang's division has now been renamed and includes the 145th and 146th Brigades, each with three regiments, while the 291st Regiment is guarding the rear in Changchow and Nanching. The remaining five regiments are all going to the front line, combining the strength of the civilian militias of five counties to more than 10,000 people. The distribution is as follows: the 145th Brigade, led by Yang Feng-nian, with the 289th Regiment led by Chen Lin-jung and the 290th Regiment led by Huang Ke-sheng, is advancing from Shihchung. The 146th Brigade, led by Wang Chen-yun, with the 292nd Regiment led by Chen Chi-fang and the 294th Regiment led by Lin Ching-lung, is advancing from Yungfu. The 293rd Regiment, led by Yang Yu-ting, is stationed in Pingho and Hsiao-chi. Yang Feng-nian is the commander of the vanguard. The units set off separately on the 10th. Yang and his troops arrived in Shihchung on the 12th. Wang and his troops arrived in Yungfu on the 13th. On the 14th, they launched a general attack on Lungyen in three directions. By the 15th, they had recaptured it. The bandits had largely retreated to Lien-cheng and Chou beforehand, so there was no major battle. The remnants retreated to Lungmen. Yang Feng-nian arrived in Lungyen on the evening of the 15th. On the 16th, Yang's regiment in Pingho and Hsiao-chi advanced to Ta-lu-hsi. On the 17th, they advanced towards Yungting. Chen Chi-fang's regiment, which recaptured Lungyen, attacked Lungmen on the morning of the 17th and recaptured it at noon. The bandits retreated to Ta-hsiao-chi. Chen's regiment continued to advance towards Ta-hsiao-chi and will join forces with Yang's regiment in Hsiao-chi on the left and right wings to recapture Yungting. Therefore, the first step of this operation is to recapture Lungyen, and the second step is to recapture Yungting. The telegrams from the two brigade commanders Yang and Wang are recorded as follows: (1) "My unit attacked Lungyen in three directions on a cold day. According to reports from various units, there are several hundred bandits entrenched in the dangerous terrain in the Pai-sha area. After our encirclement and suppression, we captured more than fifty people and seized dozens of guns. The bandits collapsed and fled. In the areas of Lang-che and Chung-chia (20 li from Yungfu and 50 li from the city of Lungyen, a key location for entering Lungyen), more than a thousand bandits gathered and resisted stubbornly. Our Wang Brigade completely defeated them. In the areas of Pai-chang, Pai-ho, and Hsi-hsi (all key locations for entering Lungyen), the bandits gathered in large numbers and resisted severely. Our Chen and Huang Regiments defeated them in separate attacks. The various units will search and suppress the bandits in the nearby areas along the lines of Yen-shih, Lang-che, Chung-chia, and Hsi-hsi by the afternoon of tomorrow (the 15th) and recapture the city of Lungyen. This is reported respectfully. Yang Feng-nian." (2) "My unit recaptured the city of Lungyen at noon on the day of suppression. All the bandits collapsed and fled to Tung-po and Lungmen. We are now dividing our forces to pursue them and clear out their nests, vowing to eliminate their leaders and eradicate the ugliness before stopping. Looking around Lungyen, nine out of ten houses are empty. Thinking of the wounds and pains, I am deeply saddened. I believe that pacifying the bandit area and collecting the refugees should be the first priority. The Party and the Sutra have issued proclamations to inform them in detail, and the propaganda team has divided into groups to explain earnestly and ask your Excellency to come to Lungyen to preside over the aftermath and plan to establish a relief committee to alleviate the people's plight. On one hand, investigate the grain stored by the pseudo-Soviet government, summon the people, and set a date for holding an anti-communist rally to announce the central government's clear order to suppress the communists and your Excellency's sympathy for the suffering of the Lungyen people. Secondly, in accordance with the joint defense method, all the able-bodied men of each village should be organized into a joint defense team, and village joint defense offices should be established in each district to elect members to be stationed in the offices and given preferential powers to ensure that the collapsed bandits have no opportunity to gather again. The county government's administration is still temporarily responsible for maintaining all the aftermath by the acting county magistrate, Xie Jian-xun. After the deployment is slightly determined, I will lead the various units to advance westward. This is reported by telegram, awaiting your instructions. Yang Feng-nian." (3) "The 192nd Regiment of the First Brigade followed orders and departed from Yungfu on the 14th and divided into two routes to advance on Lang-che. The regiment defeated the bandits in Lang-che at 10:00 AM on the 14th. It is reported that the bandits retreated to Huo-shao-keng. The regiment continued to pursue them and camped in Chung-chia on the evening of the 14th. This (15th) morning, in order to clear out the bandits near Chung-chia, they detoured around the Ko-sung Forest and arrived in the southeast of Lungyen at 1:30 PM. I led the Second Battalion of the 294th Regiment to advance into Lang-che on the 14th. On the morning of the 15th, we marched to Huo-shao-keng. The bandits gathered in the mountains to resist, but were defeated by my unit, and we obtained a native gun. At 3:00 PM, we arrived in Lungyen. The Lungyen General Civilian Militia and the Second Detachment of Guerrillas arrived in Lungyen at noon on the day of suppression. The Zhangbei Security Team fought with the bandits at Hsiao-tsun on the 14th, killing several bandits. The bandit forces were unable to resist and collapsed and retreated. Afterwards, the team advanced into Lang-che. Wang Cheng-yun." (December 19th)</p>
<h3>川省捐稅繁重之狀况</h3>
<p>舉絲捐一事爲證</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: The military factions in the Sichuan defense zones have divided the regions and are recklessly extorting and levying taxes, causing immense hardship to merchants and civilians. It is difficult to fully describe the situation. Here, I will briefly mention one or two examples, hoping that the authorities concerned will pay attention to the welfare of the people and investigate the matter. Armies are everywhere in Sichuan, often with each controlling its own area, not to mention counties that are completely separated from each other. Even within the same county and the same military district, such as Xiahe in Chongqing, which is less than ten miles from the city, a customs post is set up at Xiangguo Temple to collect taxes. Less than ten miles from Xiangguo Temple is Ciqikou, where another customs post is set up to collect taxes. The goods taxed are the same, and the names of the taxes levied are also the same. This means that two customs posts are set up within ten miles to collect taxes heavily. In some counties, such as at the East Gate, the garrison sets up a customs post to collect taxes in the name of preventing bandits, calling it "protecting merchants." At the South Gate, the bandits also set up a customs post to collect taxes. When asked, the garrison says, "You handle it yourself; we can't manage it." Then what is the meaning of protecting merchants? The garrison replies, "This is an order from the superiors; how would I know?" There are many such strange things in Sichuan. The reporter does not have the time to list them all one by one. Here, I will briefly mention the silk industry as an example, from the production area to Chongqing, a journey of more than five days, describing the customs posts and taxes collected along the way to illustrate the general situation. The center of silk production in Sichuan is Santai, which is Tian Songyao's defense zone. For each dan (unit of weight) of silk, a unified tax of four yuan and miscellaneous taxes of more than six yuan are levied. After two days of travel, you reach Suining, which is Li Qixiang's defense zone of the Border Defense Army. Within these two hundred li, three customs posts are set up at Tai Zhen (Suining) (Anju) to collect various taxes such as protection fees, stamp duties, and inspection fees, about seven yuan per customs post. Later, after the merchant Ran San repeatedly complained, they were merged into one location in Suining, collecting a total of fourteen yuan and five jiao for protection fees. About two hundred li from Suining, you reach Hechuan, which is Chen Shunong's defense zone of the 28th Army. In Hechuan, a unified tax of seven yuan and five jiao, a stamp duty of four jiao, and customs posts are set up in several locations downstream of Hechuan (Daheba) (Sanhexi) (Beipei), collecting more than ten yuan under various names such as protection fees, stamp duties, and inspection fees. This year, after the silk merchants complained repeatedly, they finally agreed to set up a joint tax collection office in Hechuan, collecting nineteen yuan and five jiao for protection fees and seven yuan for the unified tax. About two hundred li from Hechuan, you reach Chongqing, which is Liu Fucheng's defense zone. At Ciqikou, which is more than twenty li from the city of Chongqing, and Xiangguo Temple, which is more than ten li from the city, two agencies are set up, each collecting more than thirty yuan under various names such as protection fees, stamp duties, inspection fees, river defense fees, Chongqing-Kui protection fees, and Chongqing-North protection fees. Finally, upon reaching Chongqing, an import tax of eleven yuan and some change and a unified tax of seven yuan and five jiao are levied. This is a general overview of the excessive taxes levied at every stage on Sichuan silk from the production area of Santai, a journey of more than five hundred li to Chongqing. In addition, there are also so-called "collection on behalf" taxes. When one warlord wants to curry favor with another warlord, they set up a customs post to collect taxes on their behalf. For example, Liu Xiang's recent increase of eight yuan for river defense is said to be for Deng Xihou. Peng Chengfu's defense zone is originally in Yongchuan, but a customs post is set up at Ciqikou to collect three yuan and two jiao per dan of silk for Peng. The price of silk per jin (unit of weight) sold in Shanghai is only five or six hundred yuan, but from the production area, a journey of more than five hundred li to Chongqing, a total of one hundred forty or fifty yuan in taxes must be paid. The severity and burden are such that customs posts are set up every inch, and difficulties are created every inch. A journey of six hundred li cannot be completed in less than twenty days, and words cannot express the hardship. The silk industry is like this, and other industries can be imagined. One road is like this, and other roads can be imagined. The suffering of the people of Sichuan is imaginable.</p>

<p>Planning to Organize the Taihu Guerrilla Force: The Taihu bandits frequently cause disturbances, and the residents of the lakeside and the merchants traveling to and from the area are all trampled upon. Recently, a large gang of bandits gathered in Mingwan, Xishan, and launched a robbery. Fortunately, the Seventh and Eighth Squads of the Water Police bravely joined forces to suppress the bandits. After the incident, Li Jian, the captain of the Seventh Squad stationed in Mudu, decided to address the root cause by organizing the Taihu Guerrilla Force to conduct mobile guerrilla warfare throughout Taihu Lake. The plan has been submitted to Mao Mujun, the director of the Second District, and was approved at the Third District Joint Defense Conference. The estimated monthly expenses are 7,110 yuan, with a total of 31 patrol boats and 418 officers, squad members, and cooks. Each squadron is divided into three groups, with three patrol boats per group. The headquarters of the brigade and squadrons each have one patrol boat. The firepower of each squadron includes one quick-firing gun, three machine guns, sixteen box guns, and one hundred rifles. In addition, a shallow-water patrol ship is prepared as cover for the entire team. The guerrilla duties are rotated by the three squadrons on a ten-day basis, with two squadrons dedicated to patrolling the lake and key passes along the lake to gradually clear the lake area. Yesterday, the captain of the entire team submitted the above plan to Director Mao for approval and submitted it to the Department of Civil Affairs for review.</p>
<p>Two Families Robbed, Owner Expelled: On the night before last, at around 10:00 PM, more than twenty robbers with a Jiangbei accent, armed with iron rulers, iron tubes, and single-edged swords, suddenly came to the residence of Zhou Jinbao, a villager in Huayuan Pavilion, Eleventh District (South Yanshi) of this county. They broke into the house. Zhou, upon hearing the alarm, immediately hid the 200 silver dollars he had earned during the day in the ash pile near the stove and sat beside the stove. When the robbers reached the stove, they flipped Zhou over onto the water tank, hitting him on the back and waist with wooden sticks, forcing him to reveal the location of the hidden silver. They then robbed the 200 silver dollars from the ash pile. They then went to the neighboring Lou Huiquan's house and robbed six stones of white rice, a fur robe, and luggage chests. Hui Zhixun, the chief of the Seventh Public Security Bureau in charge, led the police to the scene upon hearing the alarm, but the bandits had already fled. Yesterday, eight suspects from Jiangbei were arrested and sent to the county government for interrogation. It is reported that Zhou Jinbao was seriously injured and his life may be in danger.</p>
<p>Unclear Murder Case, Request for Re-examination: Lu Benda's wife, from the thirteenth Tu of Nan Shuangmiao Bridge West Township, Fifteenth District (Qingcheng City) of this county, died in the countryside on the evening of the 18th of this month. It is rumored that she was killed by Lu Benda using his fingers. Lu Benda reported to his mother-in-law, Jiang, that she had died of a sudden illness. When Jiang received the report and arrived home, Lu would not allow her to enter the room to investigate, claiming that there was something he wanted to say, which aroused Jiang's suspicion. Therefore, she and Tu Zheng Zhang Keji reported to the county government for an autopsy. Later, Examiner Liang, accompanied by examiners Shen and Fang, went to the countryside to conduct an autopsy, stating that she had died from internal bleeding and that there was nothing else wrong. They immediately prepared a coffin and arranged for burial. Yesterday, Jiang suddenly published an advertisement in the local newspaper, claiming that the examination by the examiners was inaccurate and that they were covering up the truth and that there were many dark secrets involved, and requested that all parties uphold justice and appealed to the county government and the Higher Court to send personnel to re-examine the case to clarify the truth.</p>

According to another report, Zhang was ransomed by a Zharen (local notable) for 40 yuan. While in the bandit's den, Zhang treated the bandit leader's illness, so the bandits often instructed people to give him cigarettes. One day, the bandit leader personally said that his life's savings had been exhausted on gambling and that he had no way to borrow money. Could he be allowed to escape? Zhang Qibao, a fellow villager, said that although he had no assets, he had wealthy relatives and friends and many students, and it would not be difficult to raise a large sum of money. The bandit leader heard this and forcibly extorted 40 yuan as ransom.</p>

Yesterday, they all went on strike and gathered more than a thousand people to petition the Department of Civil Affairs. Director Zhao of the Second Section of the Department of Civil Affairs came out to explain and promised to build a third vegetable market in Bao'an Xin Street and to draw lots among the vendors registered at Genglou and Baogai Mountain to allocate them to the new market.

<p>The County Magistrate Angers the Director of the Education Bureau Away: Wu Huankun, the director of the Yangzhong County Education Bureau, previously dispatched personnel to the granary to register the education mu (area measurement) donation revenue in accordance with provincial orders. As the tax collectors refused, he reported to the Finance and Education Departments that the county government was hindering education fees and violating provincial orders. The Education Department criticized Yangzhong County Magistrate Xu Zusheng severely for encroaching on education funds and damaging education. Magistrate Xu was deeply resentful of the director of the Education Bureau for rashly reporting the matter and summoned Director Wang to his residence for questioning at around 9:00 PM on the 20th with stern words and expressions. As Director Wang felt greatly angered by this public rebuke, he left the bureau this morning and went to the provincial capital to request his resignation from the Education Department.</p>
<p>Inspection of the Security Team's Firearms and Ammunition: The Yangzhong County Government believes that it is now time for winter defense and that inspecting firearms and ammunition is a matter of urgency.

<h3>平湖</h3>
<p>Pinghu</p>
<p>Hu Zenyue Arrested and Imprisoned: Hu Zenyue, a native of Pinghu, once served as a patrol captain in the water police team. Many years ago, when Zhou Xiaoyou was the captain of the Ninth Squad, Hu committed extortion on a rice boat belonging to Yu in Xitangqiao. After the victim appealed to the province, Hu was once detained by the squad headquarters. Later, he was released on bail by Tu and others. Now, after so much time, the case has suddenly been reopened. Therefore, Hu was arrested again yesterday (the 22nd) pending interrogation.</p>
<p>Wu Guowei Escorted to the Province: Wu Guowei, the commander of the Second Anti-Smuggling Battalion stationed in Pinghu, has had a good reputation for several weeks. Recently, due to another high position, he submitted his resignation to the Anti-Smuggling Bureau, which has been approved. It is now learned that Wu was surrounded by his subordinates at the Tong'an Hotel because he had underpaid their salaries and they refused to let him go. The new Commander Jiang Xuepu's mediation was ineffective, so he had no choice but to detain Wu and escort him to the province for handling.</p>
<h3>嘉興</h3>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>The Entire Xinpu Town Robbed: Xinpu Town in the southeastern part of Jiaxing is densely populated with businesses. It borders Haiyan and Pinghu. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 AM on the 23rd, more than a hundred bandits, divided into more than ten boats, suddenly sailed to Xiaoxinhuang, north of the town, and landed. They first guarded the main transportation routes and then robbed the firearms from the town's public security bureau and the fourth squad of the volunteer security team run by the merchants. The public security bureau's patrol captain, Zhou Bin, was shot and injured by the bandits' wooden-cased gun on the spot. Patrolman Yu Jinxian was shot through the foot. More than ten members of the security team were injured. After robbing the firearms, the bandits divided up and robbed pawnshops, businesses, and residences. When the local county government learned of the incident, it telegraphed the water and land police to dispatch patrol brigades and guerrilla teams to pursue the bandits. The security team run by the merchants, led by Training Officer Zhu, also set out with armed team members to pursue and suppress the bandits. At the same time, Jiashan, Pinghu, Haiyan, and other places also assigned military police to guard key locations. The bandits robbed until 11:00 AM before fleeing in a roar to Xiaogang and escaping into Jiangsu. When they left, they kidnapped more than ten people. The two pawnshops and rice shops suffered the greatest losses. On the 24th, the steamships there were not seen, and the telegrams for pursuit had not been replied to. Therefore, the total amount of losses is still unclear. Patrol Captain Zhou and Policeman Yu, who were injured, have been sent to Dexin Hospital here for treatment. Zhou's injuries are quite serious, and his life may be in danger.</p>

<h3>山東旅陜同鄉會來函</h3>
<p>Letter from the Shandong Association in Shaanxi</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, The Shaanxi disaster is extremely severe. We earnestly request assistance from all parties. We recently sent a telegram to the Shandong Guild Hall in Shanghai, which reads: "To Chairman Jiang of the Shandong Guild Hall Committee on Westmen Road, French Concession, Shanghai: We are all travelers and regret not having met. We are deeply grateful. The natural disasters and man-made calamities in Qin Province are unbearable. The reports have been frequent and need no further elaboration. Our fellow Shandong natives traveling in Shaanxi are particularly distressed. Although various parties have provided relief and assistance, it is like a drop in the bucket and can only save a limited number of people. Not counting the dead, there are still more than 50,000 people displaced. They have no money to return to their hometowns from Qin, and no food to stay in Shaanxi. They are slowly dying and have no way to appeal. We all belong to the same hometown and cannot bear to see them suffer. We have no choice but to earnestly request that your guild hall show compassion and find a way to provide relief so that our old and young from Shandong can be spared from filling foreign ditches. Then, we will be eternally grateful. We plan to send personnel to your guild hall within the next few days to discuss everything. We are eagerly awaiting your orders. We hope that your newspaper will publish this to save the Shaanxi disaster. We are deeply grateful. Sun Shuzhai, chairman of the Shandong Association in Shaanxi, and others kowtow together on December 16th."</p>

<p>(B) The head shape is the highest stroke or strokes of equal height in a character. There are five types of head shapes: dot, horizontal, vertical, slant (strokes that are not straight, such as a stroke to the left, a downward stroke to the right, a curve, or a hook, belong to this category), and cross (two slanted strokes that intersect, such as 又 or ). The shapes of Chinese characters are extremely complex, with different structures such as attached, scattered, enclosed, overlapping, cut, covered, and parallel. Looking at the structure, there are only two types: from top to bottom and from left to right. Those that are structured from top to bottom naturally take the highest stroke or strokes of equal height in the upper part as the head shape (for example, the head shapes of 上 and 南 are both the highest vertical strokes, the head shapes of 季 and 多 are both the highest slanted strokes, the head shape of 希 is the highest crossed strokes, the head shapes of 廣 and are the highest dots, the head shapes of 品, 三, 平, and 國 are all horizontal strokes, the head shape of 前 are parallel high dot and slant strokes, the head shape of 戈 are parallel high slanted and dot strokes, the head shape of  are parallel high horizontal strokes, the head shape of 學 are parallel high slanted and crossed horizontal strokes, the head shape of 繼 are parallel high vertical, slanted, and slanted strokes. The rest can be inferred). Characters that are structured from left to right take the highest stroke or strokes of equal height in each parallel part as the head shape (for example, the head shapes of 詩 and 凍 are both the highest dot and vertical strokes in each part, the head shape of 謝 (is the highest dot, slanted, and vertical strokes in each part, the head shape of  is the highest dot, slanted, and horizontal strokes in each part, the head shape of 巡 is the highest parallel horizontal, slanted, slanted, and slanted strokes in each part, the head shape of 猶 is the highest parallel dot and slant strokes in each part. The rest can be inferred). If each part from left to right has only one stroke, then take the higher stroke or strokes of equal height as the head shape (for example, the head shape of 小 is the higher vertical stroke, the head shape of 心 is the higher dot, the head shape of 川 are parallel high slanted and vertical strokes. The rest can be inferred).</p>
<p>（附註（一）兩個頭形以上的順序都是自左而右（二）漢字頭形只有五種每字頭形之筆至多也只有五筆例如瀏字只有點斜横直直）</p>
<p>(Note: (1) The order of two or more head shapes is always from left to right. (2) There are only five types of head shapes in Chinese characters. Each character has at most five strokes in its head shape. For example, the character 瀏 has only dot, slanted, horizontal, vertical, vertical.)</p>
<p>（三）這種就每字的頭部看出頭形無論議字的和不識字的人都能一望而知</p>
<p>(3) Looking at the head shape of each character, both literate and illiterate people can immediately recognize it.</p>
<p>（丙檢字法將要檢查的字全字筆盡數清再看頭形便能檢查例如頭全數筆畫是十八筆頭形是横便從十八筆横横類上去檢查即得</p>
<p>(C) In this character search method, count the total number of strokes in the entire character to be searched, then look at the head shape to search. For example, the total number of strokes in the character 頭 is eighteen, and the head shape is horizontal, so you can search from the eighteen-stroke horizontal-horizontal category.</p>
<p>（　）字位排列依據以上原則將筆數相同之　歸爲一門再照頭形（點）（横）（直）（斜）（义）五種頭形分别順序以次排列一如英文字典之以ＡＢＣＤ··爲順序而排列簡單的說起來就是（以筆數分門以頭形别類以點横直斜义爲順序）而排列</p>
<p>(D) Character Position Arrangement: Based on the above principles, characters with the same number of strokes are grouped into one category, and then arranged in order according to the five types of head shapes (dot), (horizontal), (vertical), (slanted), and (cross), just like the order of A, B, C, D... in an English dictionary. Simply put, it is (categorize by the number of strokes, classify by the head shape, and arrange in the order of dot, horizontal, vertical, slanted, and cross).</p>

<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) HOCKEY is a kind of ball game that is popular in Europe. It is rarely seen in our country and has no fixed name. Japan has made considerable achievements in this skill after several years of promotion. During this year's Far Eastern Games, there were no opponents, so they held two demonstration matches to attract the attention of representatives from various countries in the Far East. Recently, the Japan Hockey Association decided to send a representative team to the World Games in 1932 to compete with India, which currently holds the World Hockey Championship. All expenses, estimated at over 20,000 Japanese yen, will be the responsibility of the association. It is heard that the Hockey Association of the United States was also established this year and will also send a representative team to the World Games to compete for the championship in the coming years, it is said.</p>

<h3>Put a Smile on It, Hai Ke</h3>
<p>A: Recently, the manager of our company has been very serious in his work and has paid special attention to the diligence of the staff.</p>
<p>B: Then the staff members must be suffering.</p>
<p>A: Not necessarily. The most interesting thing is that he printed many slogans and posted them all over the office.</p>
<p>B: What did these slogans say?</p>
<p>A: Very simple, only four words, called "Deal with it Immediately!" The meaning is to tell people to hurry up and work and not to delay. It was only hung up for three days, and the accounting clerk, who had been plotting to abscond, immediately absconded with more than 10,000 yuan in cash. The secretary, who had been secretly in love with the manager's daughter for a long time, also immediately ran away to get married freely. A group of junior staff members who had wanted a raise for a long time also immediately demanded a raise and threatened to strike.</p>
<p>A female: Last night, our school invited some kind of doctor of economics to give a lecture, which made me so angry.</p>
<p>B female: What did he say?</p>
<p>A female: He dared to insult us women.</p>
<p>B female: What happened? You might as well tell me.</p>
<p>A female: He said, "There are many countries in the world where there are more men than women, but our country has more women than men. So, from an economic point of view, we should move our surplus women to foreign countries to match each other." I got angry when I heard this and immediately got up and left. But he dared to say with a brazen face when he saw me leave, "But I think it's okay to go slowly, you don't have to go so fast."</p>
<h3>The Shu Road is Too Difficult, Huang Jiping</h3>
<p>The provinces of Sichuan, Tibet, Yunnan, and Guizhou are located in the border area, adjacent to neighboring countries. The natural resources are abundant, and the scenery is beautiful. The Chinese people consider them to be uncivilized regions due to traffic congestion, while foreigners go deep into the hinterland under the guise of archaeological travel to carry out conspiracies of aggression. All kinds of digging for treasures, surveying terrain, collecting customs, and spreading heresies cannot be counted as losses of power. Those who share the same concerns with Russia's long-term desire for Manchuria and Mongolia can be said to have coincided. Allowing the great rivers and mountains to be coveted by foreigners, we should know that the loss of national rights and the fear of foreign countries staring at us should be a sudden awakening. My colleague, Mr. Liu Shuofu, has extraordinary ambitions and has long intended to travel to Sichuan and Tibet. Later, with the consent of photographer Wang Xiaoting, etc., the purpose was determined to explore the truth. The scheduled trip was half a year. I was asked to temporarily take his place and prepare. After the preparations were completed, at the end of last month, I took the Yiling ship upstream along the Yangtze River to Chongqing. Yesterday, I received a letter from Yichang detailing the dangers encountered on the way. The following is an excerpt, which may also be welcome by those who are interested. On December 7th, our ship met a downstream ship at noon. Yibin used a signal to find the ship, saying that there was danger ahead and that the ship had been shelled. The sailors were all on guard. Since there was also a Yifeng ship traveling with us carrying machine guns, they relied on this to slightly reduce their fear. At about 5:00 p.m., they arrived at Shishou. This place is close to the border between Hubei and Hunan, connecting to Dongting Lake in the south. The river flows around and the water is extremely turbulent. There is a barren mountain and a dangerous bay, which is terrifying. Here, they heard the sound of artillery booming. Remotely, they saw a gray shallow-water warship firing at the houses on the mountain top. In the hazy evening, the fire was dazzling when the artillery was fired. The sailors looked at each other in dismay. Later, they heard the shipowner say that the warship belonged to the British and was named LADYBIRD. Earlier, the warship was traveling downstream from Yidong and met Yibin, who told them that they had been shelled by bandits in Shishou. So, the warship returned to Shishou and stopped. Afterwards, the mountain suddenly opened fire on it with two shots, but fortunately, neither hit. The warship then fired ten shots at the place where the fire came from. The bandits' artillery was three inches in diameter, and the warship's artillery was eight inches in diameter. It is imagined that although the bandits were not completely destroyed, there must have been considerable damage. After the artillery stopped, our ship also passed safely. It is heard from the sailors that this route is the most dangerous place. In the past, the bandits would shoot at the ships going up and down the river with guns, so the ships have recently been equipped with iron plates. Unexpectedly, recently they have changed guns to artillery, so if our ship had not met the warship, it would have been hit by artillery and there would have been no escape. As for whether the people on the mountain are bandits or soldiers, it is impossible to know. Only when approaching the area, various slogans are planted on the shore, which are quite similar to those of the Communists. I remember there were slogans such as "Soldiers' salary is twenty yuan per month" and "Red Army soldiers and officers are all equal."</p>
<p>The Yangtze River runs through Sichuan and reaches Jiangsu and Anhui, serving as a transportation artery. However, travelers do not have the protection of the country, so they rely on the force of foreigners. It is sad and shameful.</p>
<h3>Record of the Groundbreaking Ceremony for the Jiaoda Engineering Hall by Cheng Zhizheng</h3>
<p>Since Sun Zhesheng and Li Jisheng successively took charge of National Jiaotong University, they have spared no effort in expanding its content. The Ministry of Railways, in order to cultivate talent, recently approved construction funding of 550,000 yuan for the university. Among these projects, the Engineering Hall is the most ambitious. As soon as the funds were available, bids were solicited from contractors, and a groundbreaking ceremony was held a few days ago, which was quite a grand occasion. Here is a brief record of the event for your consideration.</p>
<p>On that day, it was drizzling, but the weather cleared up at noon, which can be said to be a blessing from heaven. The groundbreaking ceremony was originally scheduled for 12:30 PM, but Minister Sun Zhesheng was unable to attend due to unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, the ceremony was led by President Li, who wielded the shovel. A square platform was set up in advance with two chairs, two shovels, and one hoe placed in the center. The shovels were painted gold and silver, while the hoe was painted gold on the top and silver on the bottom. From a distance, it was difficult to tell that it was a tool. The professors and students lined up, and then ceremonial cannons were fired and music was played to start the meeting. Mr. Li reported on the plan for the hall, stating that it would cost about 600,000 yuan. Initially, a two-story building would be constructed, with the rest to be added later. The equipment would be donated by various manufacturers. In terms of naming, it is planned to commemorate Rong Chunfu, the earliest Chinese student supervisor. The name is yet to be determined. After these remarks, he raised the shovel and dug the ground an inch or so, and the grand ceremony came to an end.</p>
<p>Following Mr. Li, Dr. Hu Dunfu delivered a speech. Dr. Hu, with a cheerful smile, briefly stated that the Engineering Hall could be regarded as the foundation for all new construction in the future, which was quite appropriate. However, it lasted a long time, and the drizzle resumed. The audience had no choice but to listen quietly to the doctor's high-level discourse in the rain, which was also an interesting experience.</p>
<h3>Detailed Record of the China Photographic Society Exhibition No. 9</h3>
<p>The China Photographic Society is a renowned photographic group both at home and abroad, organized by famous domestic photographers. It holds an annual photography exhibition. This year, the fourth photography exhibition has been held since the 19th of this month. Here is a detailed record of what I have seen and heard:</p>
<p>The China Photographic Society was founded by Lang Jingshan, Hu Boxiang, and Zhang Zhenhou in Shanghai, who possess artistic talent and excel in photography. Recognizing the decline of this art in the country, they organized the China Photographic Society. According to reports, the first exhibition featured over 400 works, the second exhibition had 350 works, and the third exhibition last winter showcased 320 works. This year, including special editions, there are only over 200 works. In terms of quantity, although the number of works in each exhibition has decreased, the quality has become more refined.</p>
<p>Current Situation: This year, two new members have joined: Zhang Liyun and Mo Tianxiang. The works of the current members have all been selected by the exhibition committee, showcasing the most exquisite pieces to maintain order and facilitate viewing.</p>
<p>Future Plans: As far as I know, although the gentlemen of the society hold the great aim of promoting oriental art and enhancing the interest in life, those who wish to join the society must have their works displayed in the exhibition multiple times, have considerable research in photography, and, more importantly, possess high moral character. Therefore, they uphold strict principles and gradually express the spirit of the society throughout the country.</p>
<p>Works of This Year's Exhibition: Among the works of the members in this exhibition, such as Guo Xiqi's "Twilight at the Ferry," "Far-Reaching Ambition," "Icy Snow in Hanxi," Wang Dafo's "Miaogao Platform," "Snowy Mountain Xiaowu," Lu Zhenzhi's "Willow Line" and "Oars," Shao Woyun's "Evening Glow at the Wharf," "Dusty Shadow," Chen Shanshan's "Landscape, Figures, Clouds, and Rain," Zhang Zhenhou's "Puppet" and "Red Lady," and the "Spring God" from the third exhibition, all have the same wonderful effects. Other works are also picturesque. Among those who have not yet joined the society, such as Zhang Yuzhu, a lady from the Songjiang Huating Photography Society, her "Exotic Flower," "Thread in a Loving Mother's Hand," and Zhang Yingchao and Lang Yuxiang, two young photographers, their "Autumn in the South," "Banana Leaves," and Lu Shifu's "Desk Thunder"</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Southeast Asia (111)</h3>
<p>The Burmese emphasize decoration, with gold and silver adorning their chests. Their wealth is often carried on their bodies, and they do not value houses. Therefore, their homes are simple. They are devoted to external enjoyment and lack a long-term vision. Perhaps they take the concept of impermanence too seriously, which aligns with Yang Zhu's individualistic philosophy. If the world of Great Harmony arrives, will Myanmar be a model nation for the world? Master Wan alone praises the high culture of the Burmese and does not want others to disturb them. Is that so?</p>
<p>On the streets, there are people pulling carts carrying gifts for monks, accompanied by musical bands. There are also Indians carrying the deceased on rope beds, covering their eyes with silver paper. There are no coffins. I don't know what this means. Is it a custom?</p>
<p>On the 18th, I gave a lecture at the New Tengchong Society. Tengchong, also known as Tengyue, is the gateway for Yunnanese to Myanmar. 95% of the Yunnanese who come to Myanmar are from Tengyue. The New Tengchong Society is a youth organization that publishes magazines and runs a printing bureau. Their spirit is very good. The writers include students who have studied in Beijing and Shanghai. I hope for their development and believe that the Southwest has great potential for colonization. I lectured on the principles of mutual assistance and science, and the audience seemed to understand.</p>
<p>On the 19th, Myanmar also had peaceful athletic meets, with Japanese and Burmese women participating. Lately, they have been writing couplets for various circles and so on.</p>
<p>On the 20th, Zhan Liming was upstairs and hadn't gotten up yet when he heard the sound of footsteps on the street, which sounded exactly like the rattling of prisoners' fetters in China. When he looked, there were many Indian women walking. It is the custom in India to wear not only earrings but also gold and silver ornaments on their wrists and toes, so walking makes a sound, just like Chinese criminals. Examining the origin of this custom, it is said that after raiding brides, the men kidnap the women, imprison them, and restrain their hands and feet with shackles. They cover their faces, pierce their ears and noses, and bind their feet. Over time, they replace the ironware with gold and silver, and the practice becomes a form of decoration that they are not ashamed of. This custom is very bad, especially piercing the nose, which hinders breathing, like piercing a cow. This is extremely harmful.</p>
<p>Ms. Peizhi's practice pieces, Wu Zhonghang's "Fisherman's Song at Dusk," and "Returning Home" all have their own unique characteristics and cannot be described in detail. The eight words (a dazzling array of beautiful things) are used to summarize them. Hu Boxiang, Lang Jingshan, Zhu Shouren, and Hu Bozhou's oil-processed photos are said to have gone through multiple procedures. Zhu Shouren and the Hu brothers' gelatin-processed photos are especially painstakingly made. This kind of photography is very precious, and viewers are full of praise. The enthusiasm for visiting is evident: for the past three days, with drizzling rain, the signature book reports that about 5,000 men, women, old, and young have visited, demonstrating the attention of Shanghai people to photography. What is especially worth mentioning is that on the first day, when the rain was the heaviest, the famous painter Pan Yuliang, known both domestically and internationally, came to Shanghai by plane, accompanied by Dr. Huang Jingwan. After appreciating the works for a long time, the famous cartoonist Huang Wennong and the famous photographer Wu Zhonghang, etc., traveled by night train from the capital Changzhou. This can be described as a grand event. It is said that the society will not only continue the exhibition for two days but will also soon send the members' works to Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenyang, and other places for exhibition to promote national attention to art. This is truly a good deed to connect domestic culture.</p>
<h3>Talking about Christmas Turkey by Lu Bing</h3>
<p>On Christmas Day, December 25th, people in all white countries celebrate with joy. It is a tradition to eat pudding and, most importantly, a plate of turkey. This turkey is not usually found in recipes, but it is unique to Christmas, which is quite strange. According to ancient records, this chicken entered England on the Setestan Kapha warship. A captain at the time, the famous general William Strickland, also accompanied the ship on many expeditions and engraved the image of a turkey on his military equipment as a symbol. According to the time, this should have been in 1551 AD. From this, it can be concluded that the turkey as a Christmas food has only been around for over 300 years.</p>
<p>The Western name for turkey is TURKEY, which sounds quite similar to Turkey. Those who are unaware may suspect that the chicken is native to Turkey, but this is not the case. Turkeys are widely raised in North America, but there are not many in Turkey. The first discoverers were not Turks but Spanish navigators who went to America. As for why it has this name, there are different opinions, and no one has been able to find out the details. Some say that the chicken's cry is similar to the sound of Turkey, but this is just one theory and cannot be fully believed. In addition, there is one thing mentioned in the description: the turkey was very precious in the 16th century. Bishop Cranmer issued an edict stating that only one chicken was allowed at various banquets celebrating Christmas, and not many should be slaughtered. It is quite interesting that a turkey is mentioned in an official document, and it is something that those who are interested in Christmas traditions should know.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (42) by Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 16: Cuidian asks for words attentively, and visits the teacher. In Qinglou, the female hero talks about war generously.</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen said, "Singing 'Fighting battles and making achievements' and so on is now composing the martial arts. I'm afraid that many warlords will be achieved in the future. Although there are warlords in other countries, but the warlords in other countries can resist foreign insults. The Chinese warlords are only making internal chaos. Do you like to sing? If you like, we can buy a small organ for only thirty or forty yuan. You can play it in your spare time." Luyi said, "I am just a person who is afraid of singing. I used to hire a song teacher to teach me songs. After singing for a few days, my face turned red and I was short of breath. Later, I didn't like singing anymore. Although I also learned a few songs, but I can not sing. If I am greedy, I will not sing. Mama wants to spread her own room. This is also one of the reasons, because if I give a small sir to others, I rely on singing a few sentences. Some guests are very forgiving, and they don't ask you to sing on the stage. There are also guests who call a game and give a dollar, as if they must want you to sing. If you sing one, it doesn't count, and you want to sing another one. It's okay to listen to the good singers, but what's the point of us not being good?" Zuo Shichen said, "The things in the world always require freedom. When you sing on the stage, it is a bit compulsory. Sometimes your throat is dumb and you can't sing, so you have to force yourself to hum a few times, then you will be in a difficult situation. For example, I am happy today, and I sing naturally. I like to sing whatever I want. There is no compulsory or unfree meaning in this, so it is called the voice of nature. I think your voice is not unable to sing, but if you force you to sing, you will not be happy, and you will not sing well. If you sing freely, the voice must be very good." From that day on, Luyi went to two classes every day, sometimes even three classes. If there are few new words in that class, she can also read it. Chinese characters are difficult to say, but they are also very easy. Many new words can be understood by their meaning. They are just borrowed homophones. Probably everyone's intelligence is different. Some people have a strong memory, and some people have a good understanding. Luyi seems to belong to the latter. There are several classes that she can explain even if she is not given an explanation. This can show her understanding, but therefore, she can know her nature. From a good point of view, it is her intelligence and wisdom that surpass others. From a bad point of view, she is a bit neurotic. She is always a bit suspicious about everything, because she is suspicious of herself, so she is more melancholy. Although she is only sixteen years old, her temperament is too adult. Sometimes Zuo Shichen always wants to play for a moment after teaching the book there. They also play dominoes and make some connecting dragon games. There are also clear dragon and dark dragon in connecting dragon. Clear dragon is still okay, but dark dragon is not for the other party to know what card is connected. You are secretly Han Chinese, which requires a little care, but Zuo Shichen can't connect the dark dragon through Luyi.</p>

<h3>Financial Bullion in a Turbulent State</h3>
<p>After a sharp rise, there was a slight pullback yesterday, December 24th, and the bullion market saw another slight jump, but the state of disturbance continued, and the chaotic situation could not be stopped. At every turn, it was two or three taels. The total market volume was eight taels. As for foreign exchange, there were good and bad quotes that did not move, because each broker had bought and sold. Although they were agile, there was not much volume. Yuanmao, Yongxin, Hengyong, Yongfeng, and others were all buyers, while Taikang, Runwanxing, Shunli, Yongheng, and others were all sellers. Although overseas silver markets had reported declines, they were not moved, so the gold price opened lower and fluctuated. Buyers were numerous, and the price continued to rise. It seemed that the bills of exchange would rise, especially Yuanmao, Yongyi, Yuhongxing, and others, who were eager to buy and suddenly broke through the 670-tael mark. However, the supply was still very tight, and the price quickly fell by five or six taels. It was likely that the bills of exchange had turned from strong to loose, and the banks were still willing to sell. The market state was peaceful, but there were also one or two taels of price fluctuations on the trading floor, and there were no wholesale transactions. It was Wednesday, and there was no foreign exchange market. The final count was within 65 taels. The early market was extremely uneven for the next two days (25th and 26th) due to the holiday. The opening price for February was 665 taels, slightly lower by one tael (the rough price was around 65 taels, with Yuanmao Yong slightly higher). Silver prices for large bars were also lower by a quarter, and silver prices were also down by half. Although there were sales in the United States, market sentiment was poor, and the trend was soft. In addition, private telegrams showed a small decline of 6/8. US-Japan did not change further. Because Tongtaichang, Shunli, Wanxing, Zhifengyong, and others sold out, the price continued to drop by three taels, only 62 taels and 2 qian. At this time, Mitsubishi bought March Dalian at 1 tael, 4 qian, 1 fen, 125. Dongya sold out February and March British gold at 151.5. Not long after, Yifengyong and others bought in, and the price immediately jumped up by more than 2 taels. When the British gold was announced, the quote was 65 taels. Except for the Japanese gold, which was down by 125, the rest did not change. However, buyers were active in the market, and Xieyu and others bought in, and the price rose again to 6 taels, 7 or 8 qian, and the immediate estimate was 5 taels, 7 qian. After entering, each exchange suddenly became tight. Yuanmao Yong, Dadecheng, Yuyu, and others bravely bought in, and those who were short covered their positions in British and American gold. Sanjing sold March British gold at 15675 and also sold Citibank at $34.8125. Therefore, gold prices frequently rose, rising by more than 4 taels to 70 taels and 2 qian at 10:00. At this time, Zhejiang Mitsubishi did June British gold at 1525. A certain bank had absorbed March at 1875, but because Yongheng and others came to sell, and the market turned loose again, the price was beaten down by 7 taels, gradually falling back to 4 or 5 taels. Zhifengyong, Tongtaichang, and others all sold out, but there were still some small positions of 2 taels. Until 11:30, the count was only 65 taels and a half. The import of goods suddenly pulled up by 2 taels to 7 taels, 6 or 7 qian at 11:45. Suddenly, it was heard that British gold for March was available from the bank at 153125, and the price suddenly fell by 3 taels. In the afternoon, it was 64 taels and 5 qian. The closing price at noon was 65 taels, and then it was suppressed again by about 1 tael. Then, the goods were sold again and the price was raised by 2 taels to 4 taels. The turbulence of the market was unpredictable. The quoted price was changed to 691 taels and 2 qian. The Japanese gold was quoted down by 125 initially, and then only suppressed by 21 or 22 taels. The noon closing was 26 taels and some change.</p>
<p>The afternoon market was slightly calmer, with a decline of only 1 tael. The opening price in the afternoon was 63 taels and a half (the rough price was 4 taels to 3 taels and some change). Later, due to the small number of Indian exchanges, Sianna, Wanxing, Xieyu, Yuancheng, and Yong all entered, jumping by 2 taels. At 3:00, it was 5 taels and a half. In an instant, Yongheng, Dadecheng, and others sold out in droves, falling back by 1 tael and some change. At 3:30, it was 3 taels, 7 or 8 qian. After entering, it was flat, but there were some ups and downs of a few cents. Soon, because buyers seemed to move, the price rose by 7 or 8 qian. At 4:00, Zhifengyong came in, and the price had risen to 65 taels. At 4:30, the closing price was 64 taels and 5 qian, a decrease of 1 tael compared to the previous day, which was purely a small pullback after a big rise. The highest price during the day was 70 taels and 2 qian, and the lowest was 62 taels and 2 qian, a difference of 8 taels. The quoted price was suppressed by 28 to 15 or 16 taels, and the result was 27 taels booked, 60 taels to 65 taels to make up the water, 62 taels for the goods. The early opening price for the goods was 5 taels and 2 qian, the noon closing was 4 taels, the afternoon was 3 taels and 7 qian, and the closing price was 4 taels and 6 qian.</p>
<p>Transactions were mostly in small quantities. The following firms were trading with each other: Xinyong, Yuanmao, Yongxing, Yongyifeng, Yonghongxing, Xieyu, and Yongfeng all bought in. Tongtaichang, Taikang, Runwanxing, Hongli, Shunli, Fuxingyong, and others all sold out. Yongheng sold out several hundred bars (rumored to be from Mr. Luo's bars). The import and export of goods was quite active. Yuantaiyu, Dazhifengyong, and Dadecheng came in and out suddenly. In the afternoon, Wanxing, Zhifengyong, Fuxingyong, and Xieyu all came in. Yuanmao Yong and Dadecheng Shunli came in and out inconsistently. Chengfengyong and Yongheng all sold out. The Dalian gang sold a total of 2,000 bars and bought in 700 or 800 bars. The Guangdong gang was in a state of silence.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Turns Looser</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, and Indian silver markets all trended lower, and the market was flat. However, Citibank continued to sell. British and American exchange rates were slightly lower. The Kobe market was mediocre. The HSBC quote for each exchange was the same as the afternoon before, except that the Japanese exchange rate was quoted down by 125, which was 1 tael, 4 qian, 3 fen, 375. It was likely that the bank's transaction price was flat at first, then firm, and then looser. It was estimated that there was a change of 8 taels and 2 qian, so the exchange market also fluctuated slightly. However, it was not as intense as the gold market. The noon closing was slightly longer by 0625 compared to the previous day. The Japanese gold was flat. Because it was Wednesday afternoon, there was no market situation, and Chinese merchants slightly covered their positions. It was estimated that about 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded. Dongya, Sanjing, and others sold out, and each bank did tens of thousands of dollars in interbank transactions. It was estimated that 200,000 yuan of US dollars were settled. Sanjing's intention to sell did not diminish. Japanese gold was sold to Japanese commercial banks by the Dalian gang for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The market situation was stable, and it was the Christmas season, so the market will be closed for the next two days.</p>
<p>The British exchange's internal market only had a change of 0625. The December and March prices were offered at 1 shilling, 5 pence, 25, and the buying price was 3125. Dongya initially offered 5,000 in February and also sold 10,000 pounds in March at the same price of 3125. Later, Sanjing offered 5,000 in March at a price of 1875. Zhejiang and Mitsubishi did 10,000 pounds in June at a price of 25. The British offered 5,000 in March at noon at a price of 3125. The closing offer was 3125, and the buying price was 375.</p>
<p>The American exchange's internal market had a change of 125. The December and March opening prices were offered at $34.9375, and the buying price was $35.0625. Sanjing offered $100,000 in March at a price of $34.875 to $8125. The closing offer at noon was $35, and the buying price was $35.125.</p>
<p>The Eastern exchange's internal market had a fluctuation of 75. From the morning, the December offer was 1 tael, 4 qian, 2 fen, January was 1 tael, 4 qian, 1 fen, 875, and March was 1 tael, 4 qian, 1 fen, 75. The buying price was reduced by half a point. Mitsubishi initially absorbed March Dalian for 1 tael, 4 qian, 3 fen, 125. Later, Sanjing bought January Japanese gold for $100,000 at a price of 1 tael, 4 qian, 2 fen. At noon, the closing price for December was 1 tael, 4 qian, 1 fen, 75, January was 1 tael, 4 qian, 1 fen, 625, and March was 1 tael, 4 qian, 1 fen, and the buying price was still reduced by half a point.</p>
<h3>Big Bars Fall Back Again</h3>

<h3>Yarn Flower Yarn Market Steadily</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable. Actual sales have been more active recently, and various parties have been stagnant for a long time. There are signs of recovery recently, but Japanese merchants and Chaozhou gangs still have no intention of shorting, and the general retail investors' minds are more firm, all because the bottom is too dry.</p>
<p>The human standard presents a tight state. The opening of the human standard market in the previous market was slightly affected by the aftereffects of the Japan. The market conditions turned tight due to good news on current sales in the second and third rounds of a recent drop of six or seven cents. The results rose two, three, and four cents each. The afternoon situation was still high, with a rise of five cents for the current month and one cent for the long-term. The total volume for the day was 19,450 bales. It was found that Yi Chang had 1,900 bales, Changfeng 1,700 bales, Shenji 900 bales, and Tiancheng 1,600 bales. The remaining three, five, and six hundred bales were purchased by Yukang 1,400 bales, Ruidai 2,400 bales, Yiyu 1,450 bales, and Daji 1,200 bales. The remaining six hundred bales.

<h3>Cotton Market Shows Extreme Upward Trend</h3>
<p>The cotton market is firm, but the world cotton market is still weak. The reason why the local market is tighter is that the bulls have a strong intention to short the current month. There are still 1,400 pieces of Shaanxi cotton that have not been inspected at the inspection office, so the current month alone rose in the afternoon, and the long-term month was dragged up by it.</p>
<p>The Han standard rose by eight cents this month. The Han standard market opened in the previous market, and the market was flat due to the weakness of American cotton. The short squeeze relationship in the current month turned the situation tighter, and the result was a rise of five cents for the current month and two or three cents for the long-term. In the afternoon, the situation in the current month was still serious, and it rose another three cents, flat for the long-term. The total transaction volume for the day was 76,000 dan. It was found that Hengyi sold 4,100 dan, Tai 3,900 dan, Xingyuan 4,000 dan, and the remaining 1,7800 dan. Hengde purchased 2,800 dan, Dachangcheng 2,800 dan, Tianlong 2,500 dan, and the remaining 1,6700 dan. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Han standard closing price rise and fall stock balance: March 5210 rose two, 0129800, December 1345 rose eight, 056200, April 3210, 2589600, January 2453, 0111400, May 3215, 2552100, February 3220, 25121100.</p>
<p>The current needs have been completely suspended, and the current cotton transaction has been completely cut off. All factories have no source of intake. It is estimated that there are 400 bags of Yao cotton.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Still Tends to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to bad news from Liverpool, and then it rebounded strongly due to the strong recovery of Wall Street. Finally, it weakened again due to the closing of long positions. Futures fell by three to seven pounds. Spot prices did not move. British cotton futures fell by eight points to the upside. Spot prices fell by eight points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by points. Indian cotton was unstable due to the bullish harvest report and the unfavorable news from New York. Pingguoer fell by one rupee, and the forward fell by two rupees. Aomula fell by three rupees, and the forward fell by two rupees. Bailuoxi fell by three rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 23rd).</p>
<p>American cotton compared to the previous day Heshen regulations, British cotton compared to the previous day Heshen regulations 12964 fell 337.103522 fell 841.101962, 637.005535, 1042.103990, 438.1015899, 42.8051010, 8339.10 current 5288, 41.507104, 1640.10 Egypt 18510, 61.8011059740.80 Pingguoer 127 fell 122.30 current 980 flat 37.70 Aomula 14332.10 Bailuoxi 15330.80</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Slightly Turning Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 30 sources of domestic origin arrived in Zhabei, and sales felt slightly active. Beigeng was still sluggish at first, but because the store sales were seen to be strong, the price was tired and fixed. The high-priced goods in the overall market have felt steady, and the arrival of Bo Rice is rare, and the sales are flat. The price of Yang Du Xian has been raised uniformly, and the buying interest is not weak. The market is steady and strong. The Shanghai Xian has always been tight, and the high-priced goods opened at about 12 yuan, and the arrival and sales of Bian Yin Yuan are both weak and lack glory and disgrace.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 20 brands of river goods were seen in Shanghai South. The removal was also dull at first and then active. The Changbang high-quality japonica rice fluctuated slightly throughout the day, but the cargo customers also enjoyed selling because the New Year was approaching. The store also had a good intake at noon, and the result was as usual. The price of Geng rice from various machines such as Xisu and Tong was one dime firmer than the previous day. The market for Bo rice and early rice in the Nanbang market fluctuated, while Yang Du and other Xian rice did not rise or fall. The sales of various customers moved slightly, and retail sales also inquired slightly. The general trend was quite stable, and the circulation of Bian Yin Yuan was still dull. The situation here was mediocre, and the market price was high and fixed, with a slight reduction.</p>
<h3>The Future Market of Label Powder Fell Again</h3>
<p>After the opening of the powder market yesterday morning, the market in each month felt cheerful due to the return of the price of foreign wheat by 122 corners, and the fact that the mainland gangs were shorted because the shooting was about to stop within the year, so the buying interest in each month seemed cheerful, and the market atmosphere also stepped to see the charm. The closing price was generally more than one cent better than the closing price of the previous day. Until the afternoon opening, the current month was approaching delivery, and many non-industry long positions were gradually closed, because the factory's chips had not been drawn, so the market turned sharply down again. In the long term, each month, small factories have ordered foreign wheat (it is rumored that the combined price of No. 3 wheat is only three or two to nine cents), and they are gradually and wildly selling out in the long term, totaling more than 100,000 bags, so it is one or two cents lower than the morning. The result is that the current month fell by two cents and seven and a half cents from the previous day, January fell by seven and a half cents, February remained unchanged, March fell by a small two and a half cents, and April and May were better by five cents.</p>
<h3>There is a Short Covering Action in the Futures Wheat Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for futures wheat stabilized slightly after the opening in the morning and afternoon. The price of foreign wheat rebounded by two or three corners, and some domestic short positions were closing up one after another because they were collecting, so the market atmosphere in each market was quite charming, and there were market rumors that taxes would be levied on the import of foreign wheat in the future (it is rumored that 25% must be levied). Therefore, the shorts could not help but be wary of entering, especially since once imported, the cost would inevitably increase invisibly. As a result, January to April were two cents better than the previous day, and May was three cents better. The current wheat was silent and had not yet opened due to the factory's stomach.</p>
<h3>The Guest Xian is Extremely Dull</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for guest Xian became increasingly sluggish. Because the river Du rice poured in at a low price, the street had changed to Du Geng and Du Xian. Fortunately, the arrival was dull, and the guest vendors intended to stay until the end of the lunar year before transporting. Therefore, most of the cargo owners mainly kept the market. There was no one selling at a lower price in the market. Yesterday, no one in the market asked about the market for this guest. In the morning, 200 bags of Nanjing rough rice were sold at a price of eight and a half yuan. In the afternoon, it was returned due to an accident, resulting in no trade in only bags throughout the day, which is the unique and strange lightness this year.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Market in Taiyuan Opened Up by Three Cents</h3>
<p>The Huashi Club rose sharply by two cents and was strong.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received news from the producing area that the price of Cuban spot sugar had not risen or fallen. The New York futures product for December rose by more than two cents, and each month rose by one cent. The price of Java spot and futures sugar fluctuated. The Association's market rose sharply because of the extended period of self-issues, the slightly active domestic sales, the imminent implementation of increased tariffs, and the daily rise in foreign exchange. The market sentiment turned better, and the buying interest suddenly increased. The market price rose sharply. The Japanese sugar style was even greater, and there was a tendency to continue to work hard. The price of No. 14 Dutch sugar white sand was all eight taels and six cents, and the price of No. 20 medium sugar white was seven taels and eight and a half cents when it left the house and was short of Dutch red, which also tended to rise. The price of No. 8 goods rose to seven taels and four cents, and the price of No. 10 goods rose to seven taels, five and seven and a half cents to seven taels and six cents. The market was not weak. The initial market for Japanese sugar N mark was eight taels and seven and a half cents, and the TK mark was eight taels and seven cents. The demand was quite strong. The price of the YT mark was eight taels and six cents, and the price of the YRO mark was eight taels and five cents to eight taels and one and a half cents. The highest price of Meiji goods was eight taels and two cents, and the price of the YP mark was nine taels and one cent to nine taels and two cents. The highest price of Meiji goods was nine taels to nine taels and one cent. The market was further reduced by one cent in the after-market. Although there was no sign of stepping up, the market shapes were all very beautiful, more than two cents higher than the market on the previous day. In the numbered market, Desheng opened more than 200 bags of ice flower green at a price of seven taels and seven cents. At the same time, Nansheng intended to sell 100 bags at a price of seven taels and six cents, and the goods were inferior. Guohuo Taiyuan opened 150 boxes of ice and Wufu opened 50 boxes of ice, both at a price of seven taels and three cents. The overall hand ice Hengyu Jinmei two brands also opened dozens of boxes each at a price of six taels and four cents. The market atmosphere was strong and abnormal.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Orchid Seeds Arrive Rarely, Price Increases</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of orchid seeds has increased repeatedly, and the source has become increasingly scarce. Yesterday, the Taigu Company's Taiyuan ship entered from Xiamen and only arrived at seven pieces, and the replacement cost was high. According to Xiamen's news, the exchange rate would be increased by one or two taels according to the previous price. If the arrival is still small, the trend will still be tightened. The price of Ma Lan Ping Er opened at 94 taels and a half yesterday, which is two and a half taels higher than before.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea and Foreign Firms Have Few Silk Warp Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk warp transactions of foreign firms in the local area still tended to decline, because overseas silk sales still showed no sign of recovery, and as Christmas approached, various European firms had a few entertainment transactions because they felt that the price of silk was low. Yesterday, Dachang and other firms entered 20 packages of white factory warp, and Xinfu and other firms entered 15 packages of yellow factory warp, and the price was still difficult to rise.</p>
<h3>Another Large Batch of Red and Green Tea Shipped to Russia</h3>
<p>The Russian Association of Foreign Firms, which handles tea in Shanghai, recently entrusted the RESTIO ship to ship a large batch of red and green tea for export. It is estimated that there are 6,673 boxes of Qimen black tea, 3,785 boxes of Ningzhou black tea, 4,774 boxes of Lianghu black tea, and 1,107 boxes of Fuzhou black tea, totaling 16,439 boxes. 14,291 boxes of Gongxi green tea are worth 1 million taels of silver. Now, a new Ping An ship has been entrusted to ship 18,000 baskets of brick tea worth 250,000 taels of silver. This is the third time that Chinese tea has been shipped to Russia.</p>
<h3>The Rise of Cotton Cloth Continues</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market in this factory was even more vigorous yesterday. Actual sales have added a lot of eagerness. It is reasonable to implement the factory exit tax. The customers are afraid that the price of goods will skyrocket after the tax increase, so the search is as fierce as the previous boycott of Japanese goods. Among them, the fine lotus and fine twill are more active, because the subsequent spring order is all for sales, so the trend is smooth. Fine twill rose five cents to one cent yesterday, and fine cloth rose five cents to one and a half cents, and about 3,000 went away. The customers in this street have all handled it. Coarse cloth rose two and a half cents to five cents yesterday. The Niuzhuang, Tianjin, Ningbo and other gangs traded more than 1,000 pieces. The procurement of coarse twill in this street is also smooth. It is really because people are optimistic, so there is no shortage of people who search for any goods.</p>
<p>The market for fabrics in the east and west has risen more and fallen less. Yesterday, the fine broadcloth in the east goods was more charming. Weilan gray has disappeared. Huxinting has sold out at three cents and five lis. Jinshan Temple 錢三友图二錢九分七厘半 Sichuan, Hankou, Qingdao and other gangs went to handle a lot. The top goods are even rarer. The thick French grade, which had been sluggish for more than a month, also rose by five lis yesterday. Da Mo fei sold out at two cents, four points and seven lis.童兒二錢四分半達曆禿白二錢四分半 Floral cloth has been flooded in the city due to the abundance of goods from this factory, resulting in very few imported goods. However, Hankou, Sichuan, Taizhou and other gangs have added a lot in recent days, so it is also a charming product. There is no stock of dark colors, and colorful flowers must cost four taels and three and a half cents. The procurement of west goods such as linen yarn and French law is also quite lively in this street.</p>
<h3>Twill Flower Feather Yarn Can Arrive at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Twill flower feather yarn has been in short supply for a long time, and tailors and tailors are in urgent need, so the selling price is soaring. Although it is now one or two yuan and five cents, it is difficult to obtain. It is estimated that the stock on the market is limited, and most of them are scattered. According to the new news of the fixed goods, it is heard that this kind of twill flower feather yarn can arrive in Shanghai soon (about the end of this month). It is fortunate that the foreign firms such as Deji, Lie Feng, and Wei Li have settled the exchange rate long ago, otherwise, according to the current shilling, the cost would be unbearable. However, its opening price should also be above one or two yuan and six cents, because it is still more expensive than the old goods in the old stock. It is found that this kind of twill flower feather yarn was sold for only one or two yuan and two cents per yard in the spring.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Gang Pre-Purchases Woolen Cloth for Spring</h3>
<p>Woolen cloth transactions have been the most popular in recent days for overcoats and thick goods. Various gangs in this street have continued to add to the customer gangs. In addition to the small passenger gangs in the inland and the ports where trains pass through (because there are forwarding companies for rapid transportation), there are still continued purchases, and no one else has asked about it. The resident Shen Zhuang of the Sichuan Gang in Shanghai, such as Taigu, Yu Da, Chuantong, and Yiji Line, etc., has a demand for both large and small Sichuan Shen guests within the customs declaration line. If the woolen cloth, broadcloth, Huate cloth, and Zhigong cloth sold in the spring are all pre-purchased, it is good because the journey is far away and must be purchased early and loaded. Also, the New Year is approaching, and the purchased goods must be cheaper than the opening price last spring, because most buyers want to sell the goods and exchange them for money, and most of them are willing to cut prices. Also, the new tax next year will be increased sharply, and the shilling is shrinking sharply. The industry is generally optimistic about the selling price, and most of the economically well-off people hoard and are unwilling to sell.</p>

After inspecting the pavilions at noon, he returned to the arsenal and took a car with Guo Chengen to Longhua to inspect the medicine factory and the bomb-making factory. He finished the inspection at 2:00 PM and returned. Those who came with He on this trip were only his adjutant Tao Rui and seven guards.</p>
<p>Welcome with colorful decorations: After receiving He's telegram, the arsenal prepared a welcome in advance, so yesterday, the gates of the arsenal and the steel-making factory were decorated with colorful plaques with large characters such as "Welcome Minister He" and welcome slogans.</p>
<p>Reasons for the inspection: It is heard that He came to Shanghai for inspection because although the military affairs have ended after He took office as Minister of Military Administration this time, he still has the necessary determination to reform in terms of national defense. However, when he visited the factory yesterday, He did not express anything. However, how he will reform in the future will still have to be decided by him after returning to Beijing.

<h3>The Most Appropriate Way to Verify Births</h3>
<p>Responsibility to be assigned to obstetricians and midwives to report</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau received an order from the Municipal Government yesterday, stating that the city's population birth and death registration has always relied on the head of the household to report for registration. However, the people's level is uneven and customs are different. There are many people who can strictly abide by the truth and report the facts, but there are even more people who neglect the official order and do not report the facts. Except for the death households, the facts cannot be concealed due to funerals and other matters, the birth households are often negligent and perfunctory, so it is difficult for the organizers to rely on the number of births and deaths. Recently, the number of births in the city in September and October of the 18th year was 3,436, and the number of deaths was 3,570. The number of deaths was more than the number of births. Other places such as Hankou, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Nanjing are all the same. If this is taken as the exact number, then the population of our country will not only not increase year by year, but will decrease day by day. The absurdity is self-evident. It not only draws the criticism of the knowledgeable, but also causes foreigners to see it and will be used as clear evidence of the population decline in our country. It is even more sufficient for imperialists to use it as an excuse to invade and colonize. It is extremely important to the national glory. It is ordered that the bureau should earnestly handle the most appropriate way to assign obstetricians and midwives to be responsible for reporting the number of births they received each month to ensure accuracy. After receiving the order, Director Yuan immediately convened meetings of the district offices under his jurisdiction, and all of them agreed that they had already made a form and notified the districts under their jurisdiction to investigate all obstetricians, assistants, midwives, etc. within the territory and fill out the form for reporting.</p>
<h3>The Disarmament Public Bonds Will Be Drawn on Schedule</h3>
<p>The fourth redemption of the Disarmament Public Bonds of the Republic of China in the 18th year is scheduled to be drawn on January 10th of the 20th year at the Shanghai Bankers Association. All the bonds that are drawn are scheduled to be exchanged by the Central Bank of China and the Communications Bank in various places starting from January 31st of the 20th year.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests an Extension of the Validity Period of the Exchange of Notes between China and Egypt</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that it had received a letter from the local Tobacco Industry Association on the 23rd of this month, stating that China's tobacco leaves have always been exported to Egypt. In recent years, the country has increased the import tax on tobacco leaves to 180 Egyptian pounds per kilo, and Chinese tobacco has generally stopped exporting, and trade has been interrupted. On April 6th of this year, they submitted a request to the Council to forward it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to quickly conclude a trade treaty with Egypt to reduce the import tax on tobacco leaves and to ask the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to find a way to provide relief. It was later heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered Minister Shi, stationed in the UK, to negotiate with the Egyptian Charge d'Affaires in the UK to formulate interim trade measures between China and Egypt. On April 23rd of this year, the documents were exchanged in London. The exchange of notes stipulates that the products of China's native products and industries exported to Egypt are subject to the most-favored-nation treatment. As far as tobacco leaves are concerned, the import tax on tobacco leaves stipulated in the new tax law promulgated by Egypt is 180 Egyptian pounds per kilo, but countries that recognize the most-favored-nation treatment are charged half. The term of the exchange of notes expires on January 16, 1931, i.e., February 16th of the 20th year of the Republic of China. After February 16th, it will lose its effect. The export of Chinese tobacco leaves to Egypt is dominated by red tobacco produced in Guangfeng Tongxiang and other places. When the red tobacco is transported from the place of origin to Shanghai, it is transported to Egypt in winter after being selected and repackaged, which is at the end of the year to February and March of the following year. The peak sales period of red tobacco is at the time when the exchange of notes expires. Chinese tobacco merchants still cannot enjoy the benefits stipulated in the exchange of notes, and trade is bound to stop. Moreover, the business has not been completed, and the exchange of notes has expired. Egyptian merchants only handle the goods that Chinese merchants have imported, and there is no way out. The financial stagnation of the stockpiled Shanghai stacks has caused huge losses. The Association has repeatedly urged its counterparts to find a way to provide relief. For this reason, it is a special letter to ask the Council to quickly forward it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the Minister stationed in the UK to negotiate with the Egyptian Charge d'Affaires in the UK to extend the term of the interim exchange of notes until a formal trade agreement is concluded, so that Chinese tobacco merchants can continue to operate with peace of mind without suffering huge losses. It is sincerely prayed for. When the Association received the memorandum from the Ministry, it copied the exchange of notes (if both parties want to abolish it, they must notify it three months in advance to handle it. However, according to the date stipulated in No. 2 of the Egyptian Customs Law in 1930, this agreement will not be effective after February 16, 1931, no matter what, etc.). According to the above regulations, the expiration of this agreement is imminent. After this, the import of Chinese goods to Egypt will return to the treatment before the agreement, and high tariffs will be levied again. Our country's export trade will be hindered again. It is reasonable to telegraph the Ministry for verification and to devise remedies before the expiration date. It is convenient for the public sword. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>The Domestic Debt Creditors' Group Will Hold a Second Meeting Soon</h3>
<p>The Secretary-General who was found has accepted the invitation and is heading south.</p>
<p>The office will be established soon, and the location has been determined.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers Association initiated the organization of a domestic debt creditors' group by inviting representatives from the Tianjin and Beiping Bankers Associations. Zhang Gongquan and other five representatives were appointed to prepare to contact the Ministry of Finance on all matters and to organize a domestic debt creditors' group office in Shanghai as a permanent agency to handle domestic debt registration matters. According to reliable information, the location of the office has been borrowed from the Shanghai Bankers Association Club and is preparing to be established. The Secretary-General who was found was in the Ministry of Finance during the former Beijing government era and is very clear about everything about issuing domestic debts. He has also accepted the invitation to head south from Beiping, but has not yet obtained full consent, so it has not been announced. As soon as it is approved, the office must be established. The domestic debt creditors' group will also hold a second meeting to prepare everything. However, it is heard that the representatives from Beiping and Tianjin have returned north one after another because they are busy and cannot stay in Shanghai for a long time. The remaining affairs have been entrusted to the representatives of various banks in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Hua Shang (Chinese Merchants) Yarn Factories Appeal for Delay in Imposing Unified Cotton Yarn Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Hua Shang Yarn Factories, in a joint telegram to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry of the National Government in Nanjing, states: (1) Respectfully to Chiang Kai-shek, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, President Hu Hanmin of the Legislative Yuan, Minister Song Ziwen of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Kong Xiangxi of the Ministry of Industry: The Ministry of Finance's proposed unified cotton yarn tax concerns the very survival of China's textile industry. Before its implementation, its impact should be carefully weighed. Yarn and cloth are essential goods for the common people. The new tax exceeds current tax rates by almost two times. This only refers to factories in Shanghai. If calculated based on the original tax rates levied on inland factories, it would be four, five, six, or seven times higher. The day it is implemented, I fear it will be the day all Hua Shang factories close down. This is not scaremongering. It is our understanding that the Party and the State prioritize the people's livelihood, and developing industry is a clear order from the central government. Hua Shang yarn factories have long suffered economic oppression from foreign merchants. Our daily prayers are for the benefits of adequate protection within the tax system. It would be preposterous to be lenient towards foreigners while being harsh towards our own. Even treating domestic and foreign entities equally would contradict the rhetoric and actions against imperialism. In order to rescue our industry from the brink of ruin, we dare not remain silent. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping for your careful consideration. Sincerely, the Joint Association of Hua Shang Yarn Factories. (2) Respectfully to the Presidents of the Executive Yuan and Legislative Yuan, and the Ministers of Finance and Industry in Nanjing: Referring to our telegram submitted previously, our Association believes that the unified cotton yarn tax concerns the survival of Hua Shang factories. We sent a letter to the Unified Tax Bureau on the 20th of this month requesting a detailed explanation of the procedures, but we have not received a reply. Rumors are circulating that it will be implemented on January 1st, leaving our colleagues bewildered and at a loss. This is a significant matter, and the government should not unilaterally close its doors and implement it without considering the consequences. To suggest that Hua Shang merchants are easily dealt with and that enforcement can be forcibly carried out when the time comes is unacceptable. Such a crucial decision concerning the survival of the national industry would not have been taken lightly even in autocratic times. Your Yuan and Ministries all uphold the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, taking the welfare and benefit of the country and its people as your responsibility. If you would protect the textile industry from ruin, we request that you grant us time to carefully select suitable personnel to convene meetings with all factories for thorough discussions, to ensure that orders are carried out effectively. Alternatively, the manufacturers could elect representatives to go to the capital for study and await your decision for compliance. This telegram conveys our urgent anticipation and readiness to await your instructions. Sincerely, the Joint Association of Hua Shang Yarn Factories.</p>
<h3>New Locomotives on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway to be Tested Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau, to develop its business and adjust train schedules, ordered eight Pacific-type locomotives from the British North British Locomotive Company. After arriving in Shanghai, they were rushed to the Wusong Locomotive Factory for assembly and application. The assembly has now been completed, and the internal structures of the new locomotives are more sophisticated than previous ones. They will soon be used to pull passenger cars.

To accommodate guests who may not be able to wake up early, a special carriage will be attached, allowing them to board the previous night to avoid any temporary inconvenience. Another test run to Kunshan will be conducted next Tuesday, inviting people from all sectors of the Shanghai community to join the train and observe. Invitations have been issued by the Railway Bureau.</p>
<h3>Wine Industry Workers to Resume Work Today</h3>
<p>Second District Orders Abolition of Time Stamp</p>
<p>The strike by workers in the Shanghai wine industry has taken a sudden turn since the mediation by Director Huang of the Second District. It is expected that work will resume this afternoon. Here is a recap of yesterday's news: Workers' General Meeting Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the workers' union held its seventh membership meeting. Hu Guchun was elected as chairman. After the formalities, the chairman reported that Director Huang of the Second District Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau had instructed the Tax Collection Office to cease the time-stamping practice. The employers considered this a temporary solution and agreed to resume work first before discussing other conditions. The meeting then discussed (1) The great losses suffered by the union and businesses during this strike, and how to address them. It was resolved to request compensation from the employers and the Tax Collection Office for (a) Losses to businesses, (b) Losses to the workers' union, and (c) Food and other losses. (2) Whether to send representatives to attend the trade association meeting. It was resolved to appoint Hu Guchun and Xu Ziyi to attend. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<p>Trade Association Meeting Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, the trade association held a membership meeting. Chairman Huang Yu presided over the formalities. The chairman first reported that Li Guangzhen had unilaterally increased harsh regulations, causing a spontaneous strike by all businesses. The association had submitted a petition to the Provincial Bureau and the Second District Branch Bureau to investigate and thoroughly examine the matter. The strike has been ongoing for eight days. The Provincial Bureau responded with a telegram stating that they had dispatched Section Chief Xue to Shanghai for investigation. The Second District Branch Bureau had sent instructions to the association, ordering the Baijiu (white liquor) Tax Collection Office to cease enforcement. The association proposed preliminary solutions: (1) Abolish the time stamp, (2) The Baijiu Tax Collection Office's business hours for licensing should be from 8 AM to 5 PM, (3) Properly licensed wine should not be detained by the Baijiu Tax Collection Office without reason, and must be verified at the sales points, (4) The color of the wine should be measured at 40 degrees. These solutions had been mediated by Director Huang, and Li Guangzhen had agreed. The workers' union representative Hu Guchun then reported that the strike had caused significant losses to the businesses, and that these losses were entirely due to Li Guangzhen's unilaterally imposed regulations. He requested that the trade association seek compensation from Li Guangzhen for the strike losses, which can be divided into three categories: (a) Losses to businesses, (b) Losses to the workers' union, and (c) Food and other losses. He requested a discussion on (1) How to proceed with the four preliminary solutions agreed upon through Director Huang's mediation, now that the time stamp had been abolished by the Second District Branch Bureau. It was resolved to (a) Issue a public statement in the newspaper, (b) Send a letter to the workers' union urging businesses to resume work, (c) Report to relevant authorities, (d) Petition Section Chief Xue. (2) How to handle the workers' union representatives' request for compensation for losses. It was resolved to (a) Acknowledge that the strike was caused by pressure from the Tax Collection Office and was entirely spontaneous, therefore, the businesses found it difficult to acknowledge these losses, however, because of the amicable relationship between labor and management, after the workers' union request the association will pay each business 5 silver dollars and one silver dollar per worker for the workers' union's losses as compensation for the union's losses, (b) Write a letter to the Tax Collection Office to negotiate.</p>
<p>District Bureau Directive: Having received your report, we have ordered the Tax Collection Office to cease its obstructionist practice of stamping documents. You are hereby instructed to resume work immediately. This order is final.</p>
<p>Letter to Workers: The Trade Association's letter to the Workers' Union reads: To the Esteemed Union: We have investigated that the Second District Baijiu and Tai Jiabao Tax Collection Office unilaterally increased strict regulations, requiring time stamps on documents. Director Huang has ordered the office to cease this practice. This matter can be considered closed. We urge your union to instruct all wine businesses to resume normal operations from tomorrow onwards. We hereby inform you and request that you take note and implement accordingly. Addressed to the Wine Industry Workers' Union.</p>
<p>Telegram from Provincial Bureau: To the Shanghai Liangshao (distilled spirits) Trade Association: We have received your telegram. We had seen reports of this case and immediately telegraphed the Second District Branch Bureau to investigate and report. We have also dispatched Section Chief Xue of this Bureau to investigate.

<h3>Zhejiang Cocoon Merchants Telegraph Request for Tax Exemption</h3>
<p>Zhejiang cocoon merchants Jiang Shifang and others submitted a telegram to the government yesterday requesting exemption from silk cocoon taxes, stating: To the National Government of Nanjing, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance: Silk cocoons are a major export of China. This year, silk prices have plummeted, leading to the bankruptcy of all silk merchants. The primary cause is the manipulation of the world silk market by Japan. Added to this is the heavy burden of Chinese silk taxes, making costs excessive and competition impossible. Now that the government is determined to abolish the likin tax, we request that silk cocoons, which are actually exported, be completely exempted from all regular taxes, surtaxes, and customs duties, in order to reduce costs and promote sales. Moreover, the Executive Yuan (Ministry) previously temporarily reduced tariffs on imported Japanese cocoons. Silk cocoons are produced by domestic farmers, relating to the people's livelihood and social economy. Therefore, we urge a decisive implementation. We are deeply hopeful. Zhejiang Cocoon Merchants, Jiang Shifang, Zhao Yi, Chen Jingxian, Yu Zhisan, and others respectfully.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Association Notifies Members to Pay Water Rates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter to all members stating: Re: The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association's letter, stating that the 151% price increase by the British Shanghai Waterworks Company has been publicly denied. The company has resorted to directly cutting off water supply instead of seeking a legitimate solution. All users have refused to yield. Even those who have paid have done so under coercion. This Association expresses its admiration for this. The Shanghai Municipal Council has accepted the opinion of our Chinese members, and will hold a special meeting on December 15th to acknowledge the price increase as a *fait accompli*, but will conduct a fundamental study and improvement of the company's operations. They have resolved (1) to continue water supply and not cut it off again, and (2) a special committee composed of Municipal Council public utility members and experts will be</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>tasked with translating and studying ways for the company to reduce water fees. This Association convened a meeting of representatives on December 16th and resolved that the Municipal Council should form a special committee to investigate the water company in detail. If it is possible to reduce water prices, during the period of the special committee's work, water fees should be temporarily paid according to the company's bills. If the special committee's investigation concludes that the price increase is unjustified, the overpaid fees should be refunded. This temporary payment period, following the company's bills, is equivalent to the special committee's working period, and must not exceed the end of November of the 20th year of the Republic (1931). In addition to notifying the public, this is being communicated to you for your information. We previously requested that the Association and the Chinese Directors argue with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Shanghai International Settlement and the British Shanghai Waterworks Company to cancel the price increase and reduce the burden on users. We now communicate the above for your information.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi's Telegram to the Training Directorate</h3>
<p>Regarding Publicizing Physical Education Among the Masses</p>
<p>The Training Directorate is drafting an implementation plan for popularizing physical education among the masses. After it is approved by the National Government, it will be implemented. It is said that the plan will start with schools in various regions, and then establish physical education associations in cities and counties with convenient transportation and prosperity, dividing them into regions to popularize physical education among the masses. Chu Minyi has paid close attention to this matter, as he also has a plan for popularizing physical education among the masses, which he intends to submit to the Central Government for adoption. He telegraphed the Training Directorate yesterday to discuss the matter. The following is an excerpt from the telegram:</p>
<p>To the Training Directorate in Nanjing: I am delighted to learn that your department is drafting an implementation plan for national physical education to achieve nationwide popularization. I have some opinions on this and would like to offer my humble suggestions. I believe that in order to achieve widespread physical education, we should consider the economy of time and equipment. I recently traveled to Europe and the United States and saw the grandeur and completeness of the sports facilities of various groups, which are truly unattainable. However, the cost of these facilities often amounts to millions, which is beyond the financial capacity of our country today. I have thought deeply about this and believe that it is imperative for our country to popularize physical education today. However, to achieve practical popularization, we should not engage in empty talk. If things are too complicated or difficult, it will be difficult to proceed. Even if there is a plan, it will be just a formality. Although gymnastics in various countries is a way to strengthen the body, it is too simple and the results are slow. Our country's own martial arts, especially Taijiquan, are superior and easy to cultivate the body and mind. However, the entire posture and movements are too complicated and difficult to practice. In order to make it simple and easy, I recently created a type of Taiji exercise that combines the strengths of Taijiquan and the advantages of various gymnastics. It is refined and useful. It does not require any equipment, nor does it take up much time. It is easy to practice and can be easily popularized among the masses. The practical benefits are superior to those of gymnastics in various countries. I am now writing an explanation and preparing a plan to submit to the Central Government for approval so that it can be promoted nationwide. Your department must have some excellent plans in drafting the implementation plan for mass physical education, which can be used for reference. I believe that cooperation and coordination are necessary. Could we have a long-term discussion and temporarily postpone the proposal so that we can discuss it with each other and achieve a unified effect? I await your decision. Respectfully, Chu Minyi (24th). It is also said that He Yingqin, the Director of Training, came to Shanghai with Chu Minyi in the same car yesterday. Due to the rushed journey, they did not discuss the matter. Chu Minyi plans to visit He Yingqin tomorrow morning to discuss cooperation face-to-face.</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Petitioning Delegation to Go to Capital Today</h3>
<p>Petition to Abolish Coal Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association is extremely alarmed by the Ministry of Finance's telegram, which implemented the abolition of the likin tax, but did not mention the coal tax. The Ministry of Finance's approval on October 12, 1927, stated that due to the urgent need for funds during the active Northern Expedition, they should maintain the overall situation with difficulty. Once the abolition of the likin tax and the implementation of the new tax are carried out, this special tax should be abolished completely to take into account the people's livelihood. All subsequent approvals stated that the coal tax would be abolished when the abolition of the likin tax was implemented. The previous approvals stated that it should be included in the abolition. However, the current telegram did not mention this. It is known that there must be some changes. A meeting was convened and a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance on the 18th, requesting that it issue an order to abolish the tax to comply with the order. However, no reply has been received for many days. Therefore, another meeting was convened yesterday and Lu Qisheng, Pan Yisan, and Wang Pingnan were elected as representatives to go to the capital to petition for the abolition of the tax in order to protect the government's credibility. It is said that the three representatives have decided to depart today with the petition and the original copies of previous approvals.</p>
<h3>Wu Siyu Returned to Capital the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Wu Siyu, the Director of the Capital Police Department, visited the concession police stations in Shanghai with Qian Futang, the Chief of the General Affairs Section, Xia Quanyin, the Chief Detective, and Pan Baijian, the Director of the Tenth Police Station. The French Concession police station was visited last Friday, and the Public Concession police station was visited the day before yesterday at 3:00 PM after Du Yuesheng hosted a banquet. He returned to the capital that evening to report the observations and negotiations to the Ministry of Interior.</p>
<h3>Chen Wanli Returns from Europe</h3>
<p>Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today or Tomorrow</p>
<p>Chen Wanli, the Chief of the Fifth Section of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, who is in charge of health administration, submitted a request to the Provincial Department to have the Central Government send him to Europe to investigate health administration and the latest trends in social medicine. Chen traveled to Europe in February of this year, passing through Yugoslavia, Hungary, Poland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, England, France, Italy, and other countries. He has now returned to the country via Siberia, first to Beijing, then back to Hangzhou. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 25th or 26th of this month.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Transportation Appoints Engineer</h3>
<p>To Actively Rectify Telegraph Water Lines</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Yantai submarine cable has been recovered by the Ministry of Transportation for over 4.5 million yuan and has been handed over. However, the rectification depends on specialists. The Ministry of Transportation has instructed the Telecommunications School to appoint Hua Jian, the head professor of the Intermediate Class, as the Shanghai-Yantai waterline engineer, stationed at the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, while also serving as a professor at the school. It is said that Hua is a telecommunications expert with excellent theoretical and technical knowledge, and will contribute greatly to the development of wired telecommunications in the future.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Association Petitions to Maintain Temple Property</h3>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association submitted a document to the National Government, stating: Petition to clarify Party and national laws and to request that all departments, ministries, and provinces and cities effectively maintain domestic education, protect temple property, and ensure the people's livelihood. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen personally drafted the Party program, which guarantees freedom of belief. This means that citizens can believe in religion, and religious people are not excluded from the citizenry. The property rights of religions and the property rights of individuals are both the property rights of citizens, and are equally protected by national laws. Therefore, the Central Political Conference decided in its thirteenth meeting to instruct the National Government to order the masses not to use any force to oppress or infringe upon the freedom of belief of the people. In December of the 18th year (1929), the Regulations on Supervising Temples were promulgated, establishing that temple property belongs to the temple. The Party discipline is so clear, the instructions are so clear, and the provisions of the law are so clear. It should be possible to stabilize the people's will and prevent the wind of covetousness, protect the people's livelihood, and avoid bullying. However, in the past year or two, incidents of bullying monks, destroying temples, and plundering temple property have been seen repeatedly in various places. Although the government and various departments have repeatedly ordered to stop this, (omitted) Recently, it was seen that Tai, a teacher from the Central Education Department, and others, issued a declaration for the Temple Property Education Promotion Association, and the December 5th newspaper reported that the annual meeting of the Chinese Academy of Arts and Sciences passed a motion to request that the National Government instruct the Legislative Yuan to formulate measures for using temple property for education, and to issue a unified order to the whole country to carry out this matter. It seems that people in the intellectual circles consider using temple property for education to have legitimate reasons. They do not know that the Legislative Yuan has already stipulated that temple property belongs to the temple.</p>
<p>How can others disregard the laws and advocate for using temple property for education? The government has already instructed the masses not to use any force to oppress or infringe upon the freedom of belief of the people. How can others defy the orders and use force to oppress and infringe upon religious people? It is known that these requests that do not conform to the Party program and current laws will not be considered by the government. However, we are afraid that those people will use education as a mask, and may cause misjudgments or distortions, leading to the failure of the rule of law, and greatly violating the Premier's will. We respectfully request that the government clearly reject these petitions to stop the discussions and stabilize the people's hearts. We also request that all departments, ministries, and provinces and cities effectively maintain religion, protect temple property, and not allow any groups or individuals to cause trouble under any pretext. This is the good fortune of the Party and the country. Enclosed are two volumes of rebuttals by Hongsan, Dabeimingdao, Zhong Kanghou, Xu Zhijing, Wang Yiting, and others regarding a certain declaration. We respectfully ask for your investigation. Respectfully presented to the National Government.</p>
<h3>Funds for Relief of the Pontianak Fire</h3>
<p>The Pontianak General Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter to the Overseas Chinese Federation</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation yesterday received a report from the Pontianak Chinese General Chamber of Commerce detailing the details of the disaster. The report stated that our organization was unfortunately hit by the disastrous "99 Fire" and we are grateful to your members for their compassion and concern. We presented to various departments and commissions of the National Government and appealed for funds to provide disaster relief. We are extremely grateful for the kindness and high regard. Our port of Pontianak suffered a major fire, destroying 252 shops and causing losses of approximately 4 million Dutch guilders. More than 2,000 overseas Chinese were affected. Fortunately, many of the victims were able to find refuge with relatives and friends, avoiding the hardship of living in the open. We received a donation of 10,000 yuan from the Disaster Relief Committee, equivalent to 6,944 Dutch guilders, which we have already received. However, after several meetings of the Overseas Chinese, no concrete measures have been taken due to differing opinions. We are deeply indebted.

<h3>Eighteen Kidnappers in the Lu Shaotang Case</h3>
<p>Among the Kidnappers Are Children and Actresses</p>
<p>There is also a Student Studying at a Certain School</p>
<p>Black and White Car License Plates Were Found</p>
<p>Investigation Not Yet Complete, Trial Could Not Be Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Lu Shaotang of Suzhou, on the 18th of this month, at 6 PM, was in his own car passing the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road. Because a motorized bicycle in front was moving slowly, Lu's car could not overtake it. Suddenly, two kidnappers jumped out from the left and right sides of the road, wielding Mauser pistols and firing several shots at the Russian bodyguard sitting next to Lu, killing him. Only then did they drag Lu out and put him into the kidnappers' car, escaping westward along Jiujiang Road. It was not until the day before yesterday that the case was solved by Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Police Station, along with Chinese and foreign detectives, who rescued Lu Shaotang and arrested eighteen male and female suspects, who were detained separately. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that among the eighteen people arrested, there is a girl of only ten years old, far from adulthood and incapable of committing a crime. Yesterday, the police station requested that the Special District Court order her to be sent to the Women and Children Relief Association to await the conclusion of the case before further disposition. In addition, there are six women, one of whom is a local, young, beautiful, and fashionably dressed woman. It is rumored that she was once a [charged] actress. The remaining five women were found in other locations. One is a maid, and three are a mother, daughter, and daughter-in-law, all of whom were arrested in a house at 414 Rue Lafayette in the French Concession. A total of eight people were found in this house, namely five women and three men, and two of the three men were servants, and one was a young master currently studying at a certain public school. The remaining male criminals were successively arrested in hideouts at 374 Hede Road, the Grand Eastern Hotel on Jiujiang Road and Nanjing Road, and elsewhere on Xizang Road. The hideouts contained four large and small Mauser pistols, 113 rounds of ammunition, and two black and white car license plates, both with the number 10414. When Lu was kidnapped, a motorized bicycle was blocking the road at the scene, preventing Lu's car from moving forward and leading to the kidnapping. This motorized bicycle must have been part of the kidnappers' plan. Therefore, after Lu was kidnapped, the police station ordered all detectives to investigate the origins of this bicycle. It was later determined that its number was 238. The day before yesterday, this bicycle was found again on Jiujiang Road and was arrested along with the person riding it. Yesterday morning, the arrested men and women were brought to the Special District Court. However, Lu Shaotang, who had spent five days and nights in the kidnappers' den, was mentally exhausted and resting at home after his escape, and was unable to appear in court yesterday morning to testify. Three prostitutes, Guan Fangmei, Ying Dieying, and others, had been taken by the kidnappers to a hotel to provide entertainment. They could still recognize the faces of the kidnappers. Yesterday, they were summoned by the police station to identify them. However, because the investigation procedures were not yet complete, the trial could not be conducted. All the witnesses were ordered to leave, and the defendants were each questioned about their age and origin by the judge, who ordered them to be detained for further investigation and scheduled a trial date.</p>
<h3>Zhu Chengzhang's Injuries</h3>
<p>Still in Critical Condition</p>
<p>The circumstances of the kidnapping and escape of Zhu Chengzhang, the General Manager of the National Goods Bank, and his serious injuries, have already been reported in this newspaper. At 12:30 AM that night, Chief of General Affairs Song Ziliang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs personally invited Dr. Niu Huisheng to examine Zhu. Dr. Niu immediately sent Zhu to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road. After a detailed examination, his pulse was gone, his face was pale, and there was a lot of bleeding from the gunshot wound to his right waist. The bullet had not been removed and the right kidney was shattered. Due to his weak constitution, he could not undergo surgery. Dr. Niu Huilin and Dr. Bai were then invited to study the case together. At 2:00 AM, Dr. Niu Huisheng used a catheter to drain a large amount of blood, and then injected saline into his veins. By 4:00 AM, his complexion had improved slightly. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, his pulse was faintly detectable, and saline and sugar were again administered through the anus. In the afternoon, the wound was examined again and it was found that the large and small intestines were not injured, so he was instructed to drink juice and other liquids. At 3:00 PM, he urinated again and his pulse was over 100 beats per minute, and his spirit was slightly better than the night before, but he was still in critical condition. In addition to Dr. Niu Huisheng, Dr. Niu Huilin, and Dr. Bai, Dr. Ji, a resident doctor at the Red Cross Hospital, also visited him from time to time. Zhu's daughter, Runzhu, and Ms. Deng, who were injured during the kidnapping, are in good condition.</p>
<h3>A Brawl on the Tonghua Steamer in Haizhou</h3>
<p>Sailors and Laborers Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Chief Mate and Second Engineer Arrested</p>
<p>Dockworkers Strike in Attempted Extortion</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tonghua steamer, which was en route to Haizhou to load cargo, arrived at Dapu this time. After its arrival, local dockworkers had a violent altercation with the crew when they boarded the ship to steal food. Many sailors were injured, and some workers were also injured. Currently, the crew has been detained and the dockworkers have gone on strike, causing great disturbance. The truth will be investigated and reported as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Incident: The Tonghua steamer was urgently needed to transport a large number of goods that had arrived on the Longhai Railway to Shanghai. Therefore, it arrived at Dapu on the 22nd of this month. It was learned that while the ship was docked and loading cargo, several dockworkers sneaked into the ship's kitchen and took food without permission. At first, there were only one or two people, but gradually more workers joined in and even snatched food from the cook's hands. The cook, unable to resist due to his lack of strength and limited food supplies, shouted for the sailors to help. A major brawl ensued as a result.</p>
<p>Workers Assault the Sailors: Li A'qiao, the leader of the sailors, heard the shouting from the kitchen and rushed to see what was happening. Seeing the workers stealing food, Li immediately stepped forward to stop them. The workers refused to obey, and Li ordered the ship's stokers to drive the workers out of the kitchen. Unexpectedly, this angered the workers, and a large number of laborers, several hundred in all, who were working at the dock, stopped working and jumped onto barges, rushing onto the Tonghua steamer to start a major fight. After boarding the ship, they wielded wooden sticks and poles, hitting any sailor they saw without asking questions. At this point, the kitchen and cargo hold had become a battleground. The stokers and sailors on the ship, unwilling to back down, also mobilized to fight back against the workers. The entire ship was in turmoil, leading to a major disaster.</p>
<p>Sailors Kidnapped: During the major brawl between the workers and sailors, the shipowner and crew were unable to stop them. Because there were so many workers, each wielding weapons, from morning to noon, the workers and sailors fought in a chaotic melee. Seven or eight sailors and stokers were beaten and seriously injured by the workers, and fell on the ship. Four or five workers were also injured. Finally, the workers tied up five or six stokers, cooks, and sailors with ropes and kidnapped them ashore. As of yesterday afternoon, two days and two nights had passed, and the kidnapped sailors had not yet been released.</p>
<p>Crew Arrested: After the dockworkers brawled and kidnapped people, they were still dissatisfied that several workers had been injured. They reported to the labor union and had the injured workers carried to the county government to falsely accuse the sailors of the Tonghua steamer of injuring them without reason, and requested an examination. They also claimed that the Tonghua steamer was secretly harboring two rifles and two machine guns, and that they had threatened to use them during the fight. The county magistrate, considering the matter to be serious and unaware of the details of the case, immediately sent officers with police to the ship and arrested Chief Mate Zhang Zongyi and Second Engineer Ye Jintai and brought them to the county for questioning. They then sent police to the ship again to arrest Head Stoker Hua A'qiao and Sailor Leader Li A'qiao.</p>
<p>Dockworkers Strike: The workers were still dissatisfied with what had happened and would not stop unless the county punished the sailors. They placed the blame for the brawl on the sailors. In addition to the county investigating the matter, the dockworkers have been on strike since the 23rd as a means of coercion. Work will only resume after this case is resolved. As a result, the Tonghua steamer's transportation has been halted. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received a telegram from the shipowner, Mr. Bain, stating that only one of the arrested crew members had been released, and the others had not yet been released, making it impossible to return to Shanghai for the time being. Upon receiving this news, the Shanghai office wired the Haizhou office for an inquiry into the truth of the matter. They also wired the county government to handle the matter impartially. It is reported that the seriously injured sailors have been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Horrific Death of a Worker</h3>
<p>Crushed into Five Pieces by a Belt</p>
<p>A worker at the Ewo Cotton Mill in the Eighth Ward of Yangshupu, Mr. Jia, was working on a machine at around 6:00 PM last night. Due to carelessness, he was caught in the belt, and his arms, legs, and body were crushed into five pieces, with blood everywhere. He died instantly. The mill's clerk immediately reported the incident to the relevant police station, who ordered the arrest and brought the body to the Tongren Hospital morgue for examination.</p>
<h3>Elderly Couple Burned to Death</h3>
<p>An elderly couple, Chen Yaoting and his wife, residents of Chenjiazhai Village near Paotaiwan in Wusong, Pudong Sanguanqiao, were both in their fifties. Their son had already died, and they had a small amount of savings. On the 22nd, at around 8:00 PM, a fire suddenly broke out. At that time, Mr. and Mrs. Chen were already asleep. They woke up in a dream and got up to check, but they were surprised to find that the fire had already broken through the roof and the room was full of thick smoke. The couple was about to escape when they thought of the hundreds of silver dollars hidden in the room, so they turned back to grab a small box. When they exited the room, they were panicked and confused and could not find their</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Contraband Confiscated on Ship</h3>
<p>Sent to Customs Warehouse to Await Destruction</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Cantonese-Shanghai route Kwong Lee steamer, after arriving in Shanghai, was docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf on the 16th Pier. Yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, Customs officials, suspecting the ship was about to leave the port, dispatched customs officers, both Chinese and foreign, on a small boat to board and inspect for smuggled contraband. After searching, they discovered a large quantity of opium hidden in a secluded part of the cabin, totaling sixteen burlap sacks, weighing approximately a thousand pounds. The immense value of this opium is evident. Customs officers, fearing that wharf bandits might attempt to seize the opium during transport, telephoned the Water Police for assistance. A group of Chinese and foreign detectives, fully armed, rushed to the scene to provide protection. The transfer was completed by 12:45 PM, and the opium was escorted to the Customs warehouse to await destruction. It is rumored that the opium belonged to smugglers who specialize in trafficking contraband, secretly hiding it on the ship with the intention of transporting it to Hong Kong for sale.</p>
<h3>Additional Reports on River Collision Cases</h3>
<p>Lake Steamer Collides with Passenger Boat: The Shenhu route small steamer Li Hang, due to an issue with the China Merchants Inland Navigation Company's vessel that had sailed from Shanghai this time, had its machinery slightly damaged, but repairs were made during the voyage. Yesterday morning at 1:00 AM, the boat was sailing out of Suzhou Creek. Due to the shallow waters and numerous boats in the inland river, it often faced congestion, so it changed course to the outer river. When it reached the front of the Bailianjing Wharf on the Huangpu River, the tide was low, and the machinery malfunctioned slightly again. The operator, fearing running aground, urgently reversed. The passenger boat being towed behind was forced backward by the tide, causing the hull to collide perpendicularly with the reversing Li Hang steamer. Fortunately, immediate action was taken to brace the ships, but the hull of the passenger boat was severely damaged. In the middle of the night, the passengers on board were greatly alarmed. The boat was immediately stopped for repairs and barely towed to the lake, waiting to return to Shanghai for repairs. A foreign ship being damaged by collision in the Huangpu River the other day was already reported in this newspaper. Now it is understood that the cause of this incident was that the Great Northern Telegraph Company's Pacific ship, in front of the Sanjing Wharf on the Huangpu River, first scraped against a river pier. Coincidentally, the tide was rapid, and as the stern of the ship swung around, it collided with the right bow of the Sanjing coal transport ship Takao Maru while it was turning. The stern cabin of the Pacific ship forcefully struck the second cargo hold of the Takao Maru, causing severe damage to both ships. The stern of the Pacific ship was destroyed, and the iron plates of the second cabin of the Japanese ship were completely destroyed. The Takao Maru suffered even greater impact, causing the outer water pier of the Sanjing second wharf's trestle bridge to be damaged. The investigation was already underway yesterday. Furthermore, the rear engine blade of the Japanese Post Office's cargo ship Tokushima Maru, which was anchored at the No. 8 river pier, was also damaged by the collision, and the river pier was also damaged. Yesterday, the Pacific ship was assessed and found to require half a month for repairs due to the damage. The internal damage to the Takao Maru, including the loss of the wharf, amounted to forty to fifty thousand taels of silver. It will be necessary to wait until the coal is unloaded today before the damage can be inspected and then negotiated with Great Northern Telegraph.</p>
<h3>Barge Sunk by Steamer</h3>
<p>The Tianjin Shipping Company at the Dongtingshan Wharf in South Shanghai dispatched four barges, numbered 1234, a few days ago, loaded with goods such as kerosene, candles, old iron bars, and coal from the Texaco Oil Company, towed by the company's Tianjiu and Tiantong small steamers, intending to sail to places like Zhenjiang and Jiangyin for unloading. When they arrived at Wusong, due to strong northwest winds, it was very difficult to leave the port, so they anchored at Pao Taiwan Pu Bin to wait for the wind to calm down before departing. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday (the 23rd), around 6:30 PM, a steamer exiting the port suddenly collided with the company's No. 2 barge, causing it to sink. The six crew members were fortunately rescued by other barges, and none were injured. However, the 530 tons of coal and 60 tons of old iron bars loaded on the No. 2 barge sank to the bottom of the sea, resulting in considerable losses.</p>
<h3>Two Suspects Arrested in the Murder Case of a Foreign Employee of the Dredging Bureau</h3>
<p>Their Confessions are Incoherent</p>
<p>The Shanghai News has previously reported on the murder of Mr. Zoboli, a foreign employee who was the general manager of the Wusong Zhang Huabang Dredging Bureau workshop. Zhang, the director of the First Section of the Seventh District, arrested the employee, Chen Kangping, for questioning. Yesterday, Director Zhang learned that Cai Chunxiang, a driver, and Gan Baogen, a coppersmith, at the workshop had expressed resentment towards Mr. Zoboli's unfair treatment of them in the past and had anonymously sent letters to Engineer Huang of the General Bureau twice. The letters stated, "I am Sun Jingsu (a deceased employee of the bureau), and the Dredging Bureau, which was formed with much effort, has been taken over by a black devil. Now my unquiet spirit will definitely overthrow the black devil to avenge my third brother," and so on. Therefore, the two were arrested for questioning. Cai Chunxiang confessed that he wrote the letter, but at the time, the spirit of Sun Jingsu possessed him. If one wants to investigate in the world of ultimate bliss, one can ask Kong Yuming at the construction department of Zhang Huabang, who must have Zhang Caisheng's map and blood letter as proof, as well as Mr. Huang's certificate of office and the letter opening the world of ultimate bliss, and so on. Director Zhang, finding the suspect's confession strange and unrelated to the questions asked, suspected that he was mentally ill. Gan Baolin confessed that the foreign employee said that his work was not good and ordered him to stop working. He had an argument with the foreign employee but nothing else. After reviewing the confessions, Director Zhang ordered them to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between Hu Die and the Ling Bao Newspaper</h3>
<p>After the actress Hu Die and Lin Xuehuai had a disagreement and dissolved their engagement, all the major newspapers competed to report on the matter. The Ling Bao newspaper, edited by Lu Yifang and published three times a month, printed an article in the 79th issue on the 5th of this month entitled "(A Complete Record of Hu Die and Lin Xuehuai's Marriage Separation)," which stated that Hu had entered the demimonde. After reading the article, Hu believed that the newspaper intentionally damaged her reputation and hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to send a letter to the Ling Bao, demanding that it publish a prominent apology in the next issue, using special large characters in the original location, and sincerely apologize to Hu. Otherwise, she would file a lawsuit according to the law and refuse any mediation. The Ling Bao received the letter and delayed until the 81st issue before publishing a clarification. Hu was not satisfied and entrusted lawyer Zhan to file a criminal self-accusation with the Special District Local Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide opened the trial and summoned those present to court for a hearing. The plaintiff, Hu Die, stated the details of the defendant's libelous publication. Hu's father also testified as a witness. Lu Yifang stated that he had returned to Wuxi to edit the newspaper, and Xie Heping of Changzhou acted as his agent, resulting in this oversight. He had no intention of damaging the plaintiff's reputation. Because it was necessary to summon witnesses, Judge Feng adjourned the case to a later date.</p>
<h3>Shop Assistant Shot by Robbers in Dance Hall</h3>
<p>Life in Great Danger</p>
<p>Cai Jiuhua, a Ningbo native, 35 years old, residing at No. 217, Mingde Lane, Maybach Road, works as a shop assistant at the Le Lido dance hall. Yesterday evening at around 5:30 PM, Cai was lying in his room, not yet having gotten up, when he suddenly heard three robbers entering, displaying firearms and arbitrarily intimidating his mother. When his mother shouted loudly, a robber slapped her twice. When Cai heard the noise and got up, a robber fired a Mauser pistol, hitting Cai in the left ear. The bullet exited from the back of his head, causing a torrent of blood. Cai fell to the ground. The robbers, seeing the major catastrophe they had caused, fled in a swarm. Fortunately, no property was lost. After the police officer No. 2518 from the Xinzha Police Station received the report, he rushed to the scene. But the robbers had already fled far away. He could only send the injured person to the Renji Hospital for treatment. After the doctor performed surgery, his condition slightly improved. However, Cai's mind was confused, and his pulse was too strong. According to the doctor, Cai's injuries were too severe, and his life was in danger.</p>
<h3>Funeral of Wang Baozhan, Who Was Assassinated, Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Representative Issues Three Declarations</p>
<p>After Wang Baozhan, the standing committee member of the Shanghai North Rickshaw Pullers' Association, was assassinated,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Yesterday, his funeral was finally held. The coffin was temporarily placed at the Jianghuai Guild Hall on Jinshan Road in Zhabei. Those who attended the funeral included more than a hundred members of the Shanghai Municipal Rickshaw Pullers' Association, more than twenty rickshaw pullers from South Shanghai, more than four hundred rickshaw pullers from North Shanghai, three hundred people from the business community in Zhabei, more than twenty members of the Chicken and Duck Trade Association, and seven or eight armed police officers dispatched by the Second Division of the Fourth District of the Public Security Bureau to provide protection along the way.</p>
<p>Mr. Jun Meng Jinchen and others, representatives of the rickshaw pullers of Shanghai, also distributed a second appeal declaration during the funeral, which stated, "(Rickshaw pullers) have limited knowledge and have been repeatedly manipulated by rickshaw owners, suffering various oppressions. We have submitted petitions to various levels of government. The municipal government has issued Directive No. 977, stating that the matter belongs to labor-management relations and should be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for resolution. The Social Affairs Bureau has notified us for inquiries and reprimanded the treacherous merchants, ordering them to quickly reduce the recently increased rental fees. The treacherous merchants, relying on the power of imperialism, have not only failed to reduce the increased rental fees but have even increased them by another five cents, disregarding officials and arbitrarily exploiting rickshaw pullers. We have submitted petitions and waited expectantly, but we have already issued two declarations and still failed to achieve the goal of reducing rental fees. Moreover, rickshaw pullers are mostly destitute and cannot afford to litigate indefinitely. Living in poverty and facing the approaching winter, we have no choice but to quietly await a decision (omitted). We are issuing a third appeal, tearfully begging all sectors to uphold justice, provide assistance, and rescue the toiling civilians from the oppression of treacherous merchants."</p>
<h3>Zhou and Cheng Agree to Dissolve Engagement</h3>
<p>Judge Offers Kind Guidance</p>
<p>Both Parties Reach a Mutual Understanding and Agreement</p>
<p>Zhou Lianfang, a female teacher from this locality, residing at No. 5, Xiaobaizha, south of Hongqiao, in the West Gate, is 22 years old this year. When she was 20 years old, her mother, Zhou Zhu, acting as her guardian, and matchmakers Jiang Shuying and Jin Wenkui introduced her to Cheng Xiaodi as a potential husband. Now, Zhou Lianfang has hired lawyer Yao Jian to file a lawsuit in the local court to dissolve the engagement, stating that she did not know about the engagement at the time and therefore did not give her consent. The defendant, Cheng Xiaodi, has also hired lawyer Sun Qiying to file a defense, expressing his opposition and requesting that the engagement be maintained. The case was previously heard and ordered to be resolved out of court. Yesterday morning, a further hearing was held in the Seventh Court by Judge Yang Keqian. Both parties arrived with their lawyers, and many onlookers, mostly relatives and friends of both parties, were present. After the judge took his seat, he first asked the plaintiff, Zhou Lianfang, if there had been any resolution out of court. The defendant responded that the plaintiff had not been sincere in resolving the matter, so there had been no negotiations. Next, the defendant, Cheng Xiaodi, 28 years old, a local resident living at the intersection of Gonghe Road in Zhabei, stated that the plaintiff's request for a resolution was groundless. The court summoned the matchmaker, Jin Wenkui, 32 years old, a local resident living at No. 14, Puxianfang, Dixiwei Road, who works at the Shanghai Municipal Police Department. He stated that the plaintiff was his aunt (i.e., his wife's sister), and he was the matchmaker in name only. The original matchmaker was Jiang Shuying. According to custom, there must be two matchmakers, but in reality, he was the replacement matchmaker. At the time, there was only a gift of 40 yuan, which was entirely a traditional-style marriage. Next, Jiang Shuying, 28 years old, a local resident living at No. 52, Jixiang Lane, Dongmaqiao, stated that it was true that she was the matchmaker. The plaintiff's mother was her aunt. On the eighth day of the fourth month of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), when she got married at Dafugui, both of them (referring to the two parties) came to celebrate her wedding, and they discussed the marriage of the two parties. On the tenth day of the eighth month of that year, they became engaged. At that time, she sent a gift of 40 yuan to the bride's house, and the plaintiff was also present at the time. Next, Zhou Zhu, the plaintiff's mother, 55 years old, stated that the court asked if her daughter's lawsuit was known to her. She replied that she did not know at first, but she knew later. Now, her daughter, Lianfang, is working as a teacher at the Peicheng Public School on Yongxing Road in Zhabei. When the engagement was made the year before last, her daughter was still studying at Jingqin Girls' School. At the time, she did not notify her daughter. Her family is old-fashioned, and the engagement was determined by drawing lots. It was not until the summer of this year that she told her daughter about the situation. The court said that her daughter was requesting to dissolve the engagement, and she must give a reason that would convince the other party. She replied that she could not force her if she was unwilling. The court turned to the defendant and said that it would not be difficult for him to find a suitable partner. If the plaintiff was unwilling, it would be better to dissolve the engagement, especially since marriage issues cannot be forced. The defendant replied that his reputation would be damaged, and all his relatives and friends knew about this marriage. If it was dissolved, those who did not know the details would definitely spread rumors. The court said that the plaintiff was not looking down on him, and his reputation would not be damaged. The court ordered the plaintiff to publish a statement in the newspaper expressing respect, so that his relatives and friends would not misunderstand. They then settled the matter in court, ordering the plaintiff to return the gift of 40 yuan to the defendant and to compensate the defendant for the expenses of the engagement banquet, totaling 80 yuan. The payment was to be made within one month. Both parties expressed their willingness, and the engagement was allowed to be dissolved. The settlement was reached, and the court ordered both parties and their lawyers to sign the settlement record, and the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Another Divorce Case</h3>
<p>Du Miaojuan and Cao Qinye</p>
<p>Cao, the son of a prominent family from southern Anhui, is residing in Shanghai and currently lives in Xinyili, Maybach Road. He works as an accountant at the Gongda Textile Factory. When he was 18 years old, he married Ms. Du Miaojuan. Du is from Hangzhou, 29 years old, and has some literacy. They have been married for nearly six years. During the honeymoon phase, their relationship was good, and the couple lived harmoniously. However, after that, their love waned, and conflicts arose from time to time. However, due to their deep affection, they soon reconciled. Since their marriage, they have had two daughters and one son, ages four, three, and two, respectively. On the evening of February 1st of this year, Miaojuan was sleeping when Cao entered. The two had a verbal argument over a trivial matter, which then escalated into physical violence. Cao injured Miaojuan in the beating and she was later treated by Dr. Niu Huisheng. The medical certificate stated that there was pleurisy in the upper front part of the left lung, injuries to the upper sections of both arms, and swelling and purple discoloration around the left eye socket. After Miaojuan recovered from her injuries, she sued her husband for the crime of causing harm in the Provisional Court. Later, Miaojuan and Cao, avoiding each other, lived with her mother's family at No. 756, Tongrenli, East Wuchang Road, Hongkou. Soon after, Cao's father passed away, and Cao did not inform Miaojuan. When this was later revealed, Miaojuan was furious, feeling that Cao treated her like a stranger. She hired a lawyer to sue Cao in the Special District Local Court for divorce, citing three reasons: (1) beating and injuring her; (2) lack of affection and righteousness, i.e., Cao not informing Miaojuan of her father-in-law's death; (3) effectively abandoning her long ago, as she had been living outside to avoid him for ten months, and Cao had not been responsible for her medical and living expenses. She also requested three conditions: (1) payment of 10,000 yuan in living expenses; (2) return of all dowry and belongings; and (3) Cao to have custody of the two daughters. The trial opened yesterday morning. The plaintiff, Du Miaojuan, was wearing a black qipao and was quite petite. Her face was haggard. She complained that the marriage was arranged by matchmakers, and after the marriage, she was abused by Cao, so she temporarily lived with her mother's family. She had asked people to mediate but to no avail. Cao had beaten her severely, and she had a medical certificate as proof. She now requested that the divorce be granted. The defendant, Cao Qinye, stated that the dispute on February 1st arose from a child issue. He did not actually beat her. He only pushed her back when she pushed him. He did not want a divorce and wanted to live with her. The matchmaker, Meng Haowu, and others had previously mediated, but it was also ineffective. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated that the issue of reconciliation had been discussed when the plaintiff previously brought a criminal case against the defendant. The plaintiff requested 10,000 yuan for a divorce, but the defendant refused. The defendant's lawyer stated that minor disputes between husband and wife were common, and since they had three children, reconciliation was the best option. If the couple separated, the children would either be without a father or without a mother, which would be very painful. Moreover, if the man remarried and the woman remarried, it would be quite expensive. He asked the court to earnestly persuade Miaojuan to return to Cao. What could be called abuse for some minor quarrels? The plaintiff's lawyer also stated that outsiders thought Cao seemed willing to separate, but this could be a trick played by relatives. It was also a question of whether Cao was truly unwilling to divorce. The plaintiff's request for a divorce was also a last resort. The lawyer asked whether Cao was willing to sincerely reconcile so that they could consider it further. The defendant's lawyer said that he had asked the defendant on this point, and he would be willing to be open and accommodating to the extent possible. At this time, Du Miaojuan stepped forward and said that the emotional breakdown between the two was beyond repair. She had suffered unbearable abuse and oppression from Cao and could not live with him again. Otherwise, she would eventually be tortured by Cao. She also asked to see her children. The defendant's lawyer asked the defendant, who replied that of course the children could be seen and perhaps this would move both parties emotionally. The court then instructed both parties to try to reconcile outside and adjourned the hearing for 20 days. If reconciliation was not possible, the hearing would be held again. The lawyers for both parties also went outside to try to persuade them to reconcile.</p>

<h3>Englishman Steals Jewelry Box from Shop</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Three Years' Imprisonment</p>
<p>Lauderdale, an Englishman residing at No. 102 Albert Road in the French Concession, stole a jewelry box from the shop of Zhou Aqin, a Ningbo native, in April of this year. The jewelry box contained pearls, diamonds, and other items worth a total of 21,000 yuan. He fled with the stolen goods to Hangzhou, where he and his wife, Zhang, opened a candy store and lived in luxury. Tang Yunqing, a detective from the French Concession Police Department, learned of this and went to Hangzhou and Ningbo, where he arrested Zhou and Zhang and brought them back to Shanghai for questioning. According to Zhang's confession, some of the jewelry had already been sold to raise capital to open the store, while some of it was hidden at the home of her aunt, Mao Ding, at No. 45, Miaolong Road. The detective went to Mao Ding's home, arrested her, and recovered the stolen goods. The case was brought to the French Concession Court for prosecution yesterday. The plaintiff, Lauderdale, first described the circumstances of the theft. Zhou Aqin confessed that he committed the theft because he was poor and desperate. At the time, he mistakenly thought they were banknotes. When he returned home after the theft, he realized they were jewelry. He wanted to return them but was afraid of being prosecuted, so he sold them for cash. Zhou, Zhang, and Mao Ding all testified that when Zhou Aqin brought the jewelry, he said that he found it on the road and did not know it was stolen. They pleaded for leniency. The Chinese and foreign judges sentenced Zhou Aqin to three years in prison in the Western prison. Upon completion of his sentence, he will be permanently expelled from the French Concession. Zhou, Zhang, and Mao Ding will be permanently deported. The stolen goods were returned to the plaintiff.</p>
<h3>Extortionist Sentenced to Two Years in Prison</h3>
<p>Cao Zikang, the owner of Yuxinxiang Foreign Goods Store at No. 133, Ximen Road, French Concession, received four threatening letters a few days ago, demanding 1,000 yuan. The letters instructed him to deliver the money near the Great World entertainment center. The messenger was to be an old woman holding the Shen Bao newspaper. After receiving the letters, Cao reported the matter to the French Concession Police Department, requesting an investigation. Detective Qian Yumin and Detective Zhang Daorong were dispatched to the designated location, where they arrested a suspect named Bian Juqi and brought him to the police station. The case was brought to the French Concession Court for prosecution yesterday. The plaintiff first described the circumstances of the crime and presented the threatening letters as evidence. Bian Juqi confessed that he was a Jiangbei native, 24 years old, and committed the crime because he was poor and desperate. He pleaded for leniency. The Chinese and foreign judges sentenced Bian to two years in prison in the Western prison. Upon completion of his sentence, he will be permanently expelled from the French Concession.</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Broken Engagement</h3>
<p>Once Prospective Relatives, Now Strangers</p>
<p>Qi Pan, a woman from Yancheng, 40 years old, has a son named Shidao, 20 years old. Since childhood, she advocated for the engagement of her son with the daughter of a fellow villager, Jiang Hu, named Xiaocuizi, through Wang Zhenhai, Hu Guobin, Hu Guowen, and others whom she knew. In the beginning, the Qi family had fields, houses, and property and was considered well-off. But then, they were struck by a flood, and their fields and houses were submerged. The family gradually became impoverished. The mother and son had no choice but to come to Shanghai to rent a place near Xuejia浜 in the South City. Shidao earned money by pulling a rickshaw. Recently, Qi realized that her son had grown up and Xiaocuizi was 19 years old, the right age to get married. So she invited the matchmakers to visit the Jiang family to discuss the wedding. But Jiang Hu, seeing that the Qi family had fallen on hard times, suddenly wanted to break off the engagement. Despite repeated attempts by the matchmakers to persuade her, she ultimately refused. Yesterday afternoon at around 5:00 PM, Qi Pan, along with her son Shidao, went to her in-laws' house at No. 32 Qingyan Lane to request the wedding. Not only did they deny the engagement, but they were also insulted and scolded. Qi and her son were also very angry. After a verbal battle, they disagreed and had a major conflict. Tian Weiqing, the police officer guarding Post No. 25 in the area, heard the commotion and brought the man and woman to the First Sub-District First Division Police Station. After a preliminary hearing by the station chief, he ordered them to be temporarily detained pending investigation and handling.</p>

<p>At around 11:00 PM the other night, Zhuang Fuxiang, Xu Jingen, Wu Dongsheng, Zhu Mingshan, Xu Laxiao, and other patrons of the Red Wood Gang were bathing in the Xicheng First Pond Bathhouse in the South City when a group of hooligans led by Yuan Mingshan, Shao Dejin, Liu Kunduo, and others came to the bathhouse and demanded 10 yuan from Xu Jingen, the owner of Red Wood. Xu replied that he had no money. Yuan Mingshan then used a long bench to attack Xu Jingen. Seeing the violent onslaught, Xu immediately dodged, but accidentally hit Zhuang Fuxiang on the head, causing him to bleed profusely. Wu Dongsheng and others of the Red Wood Gang also retaliated with long benches and other weapons. The fight was chaotic, and the bathers fled. Liu Chunxi, the police officer from Post No. 2, Second Division, who was summoned to the scene, arrested the culprits Yuan Mingshan, Shao Dejin, Liu Kunduo, and others, along with two injured people and Zhuang Fuxiang, Xu Jingen, and others. After questioning by Station Chief Guo, it was found that Yuan Mingshan and others had dared to gather a crowd to demand money, but they failed and injured people in the fight. The case was criminal in nature and was referred to the Local Court for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Ticket Seller Mistreats Passenger, Provoking Public Outrage</h3>
<p>Huang Jian, a technician at the Municipal Works Bureau, was accompanied by his subordinates on the French Commercial No. 5 tram at approximately 7:00 PM yesterday.

The ticket seller then cursed at him and even assaulted him. The passengers were outraged. When they got off the tram at the stop, the ticket seller called other ticket sellers on the tram and assaulted Huang, the technician. Fortunately, Jiang Xilin, the police officer from Post No. 1, Second Division, arrived and helped to remove the ticket seller's badge and brought him to the station for questioning.</p>

<h3>A Glimmer of Light in Labor</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Journalism Society in Labor, its wall newspaper ("New Light") has been published. Its organization is similar to that of major newspapers in Shanghai, such as special dispatches, selected dispatches, current events, news, commentary, literature and art, gossip, and various other news columns, each with an editor-in-chief. The content is substantial, innovative, and worthy of our attention because they can grasp the spirit of the times and stand on the ground of a China with a weak national consciousness to instruct young people on how to work hard and how to develop our frustrated and depressed national consciousness, so that the slumbering nation can rise vigorously and advance on the road to evolution.</p>
<p>Last Saturday evening (the 13th), the Labor singing team held a small music performance. In addition to a large advertisement in the ("New Light") newspaper, a special ("Music Supplement") column was opened to publish works related to the performance, including the editor's "Why Are We Holding This Concert?" Vijay's "(About Music)," the Stone Mason's "(The General Trend of New Music)," Zhihen's "(Using the Great Power of Music to Awaken the Sleeping Nation)," Songbai's "(Introduction to the Musical Pieces Performed by the Labor Singing Team)," and other works that used sharp eyes, true theories, and fluent text to illustrate the inseparable relationship between music and the issue of national survival, as well as our lives.</p>
<p>Indeed, we deeply feel that the aging nation lacks the infusion of art, which makes this nation depressed. We see that my China, with such rudimentary music knowledge, clearly exhibits a decadent national spirit. Looking further, the nations of Europe and the United States are so lively and energetic, which cannot but be attributed to the popularity of music. Therefore, the popularization of music occupies a very important position in the development of national culture.</p>
<p>Because we are all equally eager for the king of the arts, music, to be infused into everyone's hearts when China's national character is so weak. I will introduce Zhihen's</p>
<p>(Use the Great Power of Music to Awaken the Sleeping Nation) to the readers.</p>
<p>(Our nation is asleep and needs to be awakened by the loud voice of music.</p>
<p>What can be done to save an entire nation that is depressed, listless, and has fallen into a state of unconsciousness? Truly, in this melancholy and silent atmosphere, they feel lonely. We must break through this melancholy, disturb this tranquility, and eliminate this loneliness to awaken, leap, and cheer the entire nation. Do we not see the teenagers in our nation depressed, aging, and decadent? Are not large groups of walking corpses wandering on the road to death? Then we must awaken them with the passion of music, wash away their decadent atmosphere with the cool water of music, fundamentally eliminate their inner melancholy and depression, and irrigate their withered hearts with the blood of music to grow vibrant flowers and plants. Only after everyone jumps out of the prison of death can they know the joy of life, feel the sorrow of death, and the pain of destruction, and know that they must struggle and fight urgently under heavy oppression. Only after the entire nation accepts the warm love of music, the encouragement and agitation of music, can the nation be full of vitality because we believe that music is a potent drug for the human spirit.)</p>
<p>Whether a nation's nationality is upward or progressive depends entirely on the degree and interest of the nation's constituent elements in music. Therefore, the effect of music on a nation can promote the improvement and development of its nationality, and on an individual, it can cultivate a noble personality.</p>
<p>Although the German nation was disastrously defeated in this world war, it has still returned to its former vigorous state, which can not be attributed to the effect of the popularization of music within their nation.</p>
<p>During the French Revolution in the eighteenth century, a Marseillaise revolutionary song gave rise to the now free and equal French nation. From this, we can know the strength of the power of music to influence people.</p>
<p>Ancient Greece took music as the center of education, the main purpose of which was to encourage the impassioned nature of its people and to win glory for the nation.</p>
<p>Music is a place to express personal inner emotions, so rich emotions use music to penetrate people's hearts, making them universally feel the joy of the world, making them sing the joy and longing for life. Truly, our emotional life is fullest and richest only in music. We wish that this full and rich emotional music would be inserted into people's hearts and awaken the nation that is sleeping in the dreary prison (End).</p>

After resigning, he has been practicing medicine in the building of the Yuebin Hotel in Dada Lane, Sixteen Shop for nearly a year and has saved countless people. Especially the people from his hometown in Shanghai, all ask him for treatment for their illnesses and he always responds to them.

<p>The People's Maternity Hospital inside the Shanghai Sino-German Hospital in Zhangjiabin, Jing'an Temple Road, declares that the hospital has been established for ten years. Dr. Yu Songjun, a gynecological expert, is in charge. On average, there are about 100 women giving birth every month, especially in difficult labor. Those who encounter difficult labor and are at a loss can undergo surgery at the hospital without any worries, which is quite trusted by people from all walks of life. Unfortunately, the site is limited and most of the patients are poor. The ordinary ward only charges four corners, benefiting pregnant women as the gospel of Shanghai. In recent years, the number of pregnant women admitted to the hospital has increased even more, and although there are 60 to 70 beds, they still feel insufficient, and expanding the hospital is imperative. Usually, students from the Sino-German Midwifery School practice next to the bed, which increases their experience. Because there are so many pregnant women, it is difficult for students to practice separately. It is suspected that the number of students will be increased next spring to make a great contribution.</p>
<h3>Painting and Calligraphy News</h3>
<p>The young calligrapher and painter Mr. Lin Zibai declares that his personal calligraphy and painting exhibition was originally planned to be held in early January.

Now it has been booked with the association for three days, from January 30 to February 1, for public exhibition. In addition, anyone who buys a work will write a couplet on the spot and give a copy of the new Huaguang Bianyuekan, a semi-monthly publication of the Yanglang Art Society. I hope enthusiasts will not miss this opportunity.</p>
