<p>總統正考核繼任人選兩院議長推薦普恩賚</p>
<p>國民社四日巴黎電　法國泰狄歐内閣今晚突上辭呈殊出人之意外蓋參議院内雖有多數議員反對泰氏但尚無倒閣之舉不料泰氏之遽自辭職總統杜美爾於夜十時一刻接見泰氏受其辭呈並　於新閣未成之前照常處理日行政務後隨即召集參衆兩院議長商議繼任人選兩院議長俱推薦前總理普恩賚爲在財政舞弊案後足以挽回民心之唯一人物惟據普氏友人意見普之體氣尚未恢復難勝繁劇恐未必即允出山至於其次當以前農長與財長歇隆最有希望云</p>
<p>國民社五日巴黎電　今日此間各晨報對於泰狄歐在參院之失敗及其辭職一事揣測紛拏現謂泰氏之被排以去將造成前總理普恩賚捲土重來之局面至於普氏本人昨晚决不組閣之宣言則多不予以深信如瑪丁報載稱普氏即自不願再行出山終必將被左右之勸駕及總統之敦促而勉作馮婦蓋以總統之意非由普氏組織集中之内閣决不易解决目下議院之僵局也表耐爾及巴黎日報亦均稱在此劇烈政潮之中非德高望厚之普氏出而組閣决不能挽此狂瀾也</p>

<p>路透社五日巴黎電　十一月十八日司法部長貝萊辭職閲十日公共工程次長福爾柯士與美術次長勞蒂相率辭職爲時無幾而政府以失敗聞此乃可注意者也貝萊辭職俾可向國會委員會陳訴與烏斯特利銀行倒閉案有關之事件而福爾柯士與勞蒂兩次長之辭職皆欲在委員會傳召時有完全之行動自由也泰狄歐切實聲稱不願加入新政府普恩賚與白里安將否加人亦屬疑問故政局甚爲困難下星期内新政府未必能成立</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>作旁行斜上文字所用鋼筆縱無人能道其何時發明但海外文人案頭創備以來屈指至今適值百載蓋自西歷一千八百三十年潘雷與滿遜兩氏將自製鋼筆由伯明罕運往倫敦陳列銷售實開社會上發現鋼筆之紀錄</p>
<p>在鋼筆尚未發明時鵝毛管筆在書寫上佔有重要位置毛管鋭端時須修削故古代文人常於身畔携有小刀現雖時過境遷無需乎此然積習相沿小刀仍爲多數學子常佩之物殆亦數典未能忘祖也</p>
<p>首創之鋼筆殆在一千八百三十年以前祇因當時社會無人注意及之耳考查往錄一千七百四十八年英之愛克斯拉却玻里即有鋼筆之出現其後直至一千八百三十年伯明罕地方製造後始逐漸施諸實用最初筆形並不如現狀之具有筆頭式如長細鋼管而備木製之握柄佳者可供繪圖花樣繁多惟製造則大同小異大約在一千八百三十年間所産鋼筆普通每枝之價需一先令較諸半辨士一桿之鵝毛管筆其值相差甚遠但鋼筆出而鵝毛管筆漸歸消滅考厥原因無非取其耐久經用之故在伯明罕一地一千八百五十年所産鋼筆總數可達四百萬枝至一千八百九十二年竟增加至一千三百萬枝自此以後自來水筆及打字機先後出世鋼筆營業稍受打擊然每歲行銷仍可滿七百萬枝云</p>

<h3>最小的問題（上）</h3>
<p>— 振鐸</p>
<p>上楊杏佛先生的講演—</p>
<p>我們中人的腦筋並不比人家笨不過並没有那種堅持的毅力罷了譬如我們在美國的留學生他們的成績都很好等到拿了文憑回國以後看看没有事情好幹的時候什麽都情願拿着幹决不像人家在外國成績固然有時連分數都不及格但等他回國以後十年他們就發明了很大的貢獻他們的精神是可以佩服的他們將自已所學的東西一心一志下研究去所得的結果是那樣好而我們一回國一天没有事情就急得拼命</p>
<p>爲了一個所謂（士）人他們的人生觀可以分作三個時期第一個時期是少年時期我稱他爲（志士）血氣方剛的青年自然不得不喊幾聲跳幾跳超過了這（志士）的時期便入了中年時期也就是（名士）時期在學校裏固然得喊喊跳跳出了學校就不得不想在社會上佔個高等的地位就是所謂超人一等的（名士）並且這（名士）有特别的權威有特别的待遇人家不好作的事（名士）却好作因爲他是個在社會上有特殊地位的（名士）於是所謂（名士風流）在他們像是高傲得很的</p>
<p>過了這中年時期漸漸走入了老年時期於是吃素念經的（居士）就這樣産生了他們也許以爲這生（名士）做得還不夠還得修修來世遇見了人總是講講玄理談談佛經他們是安逸得很了不愁吃食地做起修行的（居士）來</p>
<p>所以在這種（三士）人生觀底下一個國家怎生弄得好農工商是被人踏在脚底下就是有人提倡農業工業的人他們本身就不去作農工當然對於農工的痛苦又何從减起呢所以一種呼喊至少是要自已本身經騐得來的</p>
<p>看（英國現在的工黨的執政）他們本身就是一個做工的人對於工人的苦楚當然知道得透澈些</p>
<p>所以我説這最小的問題就是要打倒這（三士）的人生觀對於一切科學事業糾紛才可以解决</p>
<p>這篇演講稿還是去年年底楊先生在中公講演的舊稿現在看看還没失去它原來的意思雖然我是不曾給楊先生自已看過然而大意大約是不錯的</p>

<h3>室内寫生</h3>
<p>— 詹碧</p>
<p>這眞是有趣的事情吧</p>
<p>每週到了星期二大家總感覺有精神一些星期二午後二鐘是我們底最有興趣的寫生時間教師很年青而且和靄異常面上時浮着可愛的笑容教師天性很喜愛花我們室内寫生的畫材常是花每當上課的預備鈴響了他一手揑着一束新鮮的花卉一手提着花瓶徐徐地從辦公室走出來他一看到了我們就笑着説</p>
<p>（今天的花顔色很鮮麗畫下來眞好看而且還是多麽香呢）</p>
<p>歐同學説</p>
<p>（今天這樣多的花寫生要不到這樣多我要一支）</p>
<p>皮同學説</p>
<p>（我也要幾朶）</p>
<p>十幾個同學跑上去把教師圍着他只把手抬得高高的年齡稍大的一些同學只是説年齡小的同學硬要去搶他手中底花搬他底手下來他逼不得已故意落掉一二支花在地面上她們搶拾地上的花時他已跑進教室裏去了在教室裏同學不大敢玩皮因爲怕的級任來看到了不好！要扣品行分</p>
<p>教師在地下細擺着畫的花我們總説這樣地擺起不好他又那樣地擺起我們又説不好他只是向我們很和靄地説</p>
<p>（將就將就一些這個景佈得不好只要你們注意畫出來寫得好就好了</p>
<p>我們哈哈地笑笑埋頭就開始描畫我們雖是後期師範專研究藝術可是實習鐘點很少每次寫生總是要教師改的我們很快的把顔色畫上一到就呼着先生改你一喊着她也喊起一教室的人都喊起把教師喊得東與這個還没改</p>

<p>好又喊到西邊去了我們把他喊得天昏地亂般的我們用手蒙着嘴噗哧噗哧笑個不了教師只是駡我們調皮當他駡了我們之後我們也就規規矩矩慢慢　當先我們要那樣喊他改是故意逗他駡在我們覺得他每次駡人都是笑容可掬的駡我們每次却想他駡一次覺得畫起畫來有精神些</p>
<p>當我們那樣調皮過了教室中的細語聲就起了</p>
<p>（她底未婚夫眞難看她又那樣可愛眞可惜鮮花揷在牛糞中了）</p>
<p>（你底lover眞好看漂漂亮亮小白臉……</p>
<p>（你想嗎我介紹給你）</p>
<p>（我要擰你底嘴……）</p>
<p>噗哧噗哧全教室内都笑起來把那位老師弄得莫名其妙他仰頭看著我們在笑他也笑起來</p>
<p>同學們底畫都要改完了我就偷偷地跑去把花完全拿來藏在背後老師先是埋着頭的他改了幾筆抬頭一看花没有見了他那臉一沉嘴一𢭵隨後又笑着説你們要拿去也該等一些些還没有畫完嗎）</p>
<p>我把花拿去在那花瓶上一揷我又取下他只是笑我調皮鬼同學又盡都笑起來</p>
<p>在這九十月中花的種類是很多而果實也是有很多的上市了教師喜歡畫花我們也覺得花可以給我們便利我們畫了還可以拿來飾書案查是我們很想吃果實我們就要求教師我們要畫果實教師畫改完了剛要走出教室門的時候我跑上去喊着他很愼重的説</p>
<p>（先生花卉畫　煩了　我們下次畫果實）</p>
<p>（好好畫果實呃但是你們莫當先就來拿去吃喲）</p>
<p>我們都説</p>
<p>（誰吃誰吃）</p>
<p>他也不答聲笑盈盈地就走了我們的一些同學計議着下次開老師一個玩笑吧等他剛擺好的時候我們假意説去另外佈一佈景就把那些東西拿了他又是顧面子的他不能再去向教務處要畫材他一定自已會拿铜鋼出來買這眞有趣味哩</p>
<p>下禮拜教師果然提的果實來用襯布包着又依然笑盈盈説</p>
<p>（橙子橘子梨子畫出來一定好看的）</p>
<p>他走進了教室内他底眼光狠尖鋭的瞄到我們他一方面佈景一方面説</p>
<p>（今天請你們注意果實是比較好畫些畫出來的趣味較花好但是用不着改光線要統一得多顔色又容易分别我今天只是説説比方你們顔色用得不好我只告訴你們的調色</p>
<p>同學昌貞離開她的坐位説</p>
<p>（先生我來代你擺你佈置得一點不好）</p>

<h3>飯堂裡的糾紛</h3>
<p>— 浩翰</p>
<p>上海各校因爲購買地基不容易的緣故校舍大多是很狹隘的就是資格老辦得很發達的學校添建校舍不能和增加學生成正比例的發展結果學校所有寥寥的幾所宿舍只能供給少數同學的住宿有大部份的同學是租寓在校外的</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Proclamation to the People Who Mistakenly Joined the Communist Party</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Chiang Kai-shek issued a very sincere proclamation to the people who mistakenly joined the Communist bandit party, stating that there are now three points: (1) Those who sincerely repent, break away, surrender, and live peacefully will be pardoned and given appropriate certificates to live in peace. (2) Those who sincerely repent and bring guns and equipment to surrender will not only be pardoned but also given appropriate rewards. (3) Those who capture or kill ringleaders or important bandit leaders and surrender will not only be pardoned but also heavily rewarded. The Commander-in-Chief will keep his word. I hope you will not hesitate or be afraid, but surrender frankly. You will be given special preferential treatment in accordance with the above conditions. As long as you sincerely repent, you are good people. The Commander-in-Chief is also determined not to use harsh measures again. After this sincere guidance, if you continue to be obsessed, it is because you are willing to do evil and are unwilling to live among human beings. The crime is unforgivable. You must know that this time, there are more than 300,000 troops in the bandit suppression army. The navy has more than 20 warships patrolling and assisting in the suppression. Dozens of aircraft will also join in the bombing. The encirclement on all sides is like a net. Once hit hard, they will be wiped out and cannot be spared.

<p>(1) The most important task that the government is currently paying attention to is the issue of abolishing extraterritoriality, and it is expected to be completed in the shortest possible time. Further discussions have been made on the legal rights of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has drafted answers to Britain and the United States. The American side has submitted the answers to the American Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Minister Wu in the United States, and the British side has also submitted the answers to British Ambassador Lampson by myself. The final answer will also be submitted for France soon.</p>
<p>(2) In order to complete the procedures for recovering the Hankou concession, the government has issued a note to the French Minister to China and the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in China, asking them to discuss the closing and recovery methods. There were originally five countries in the Hankou concession. Germany was recovered during the war, Russia was recovered during the previous resumption of diplomatic relations, and the United Kingdom was recovered in 1927. Now, only Japan and France remain. In order to facilitate the unified jurisdiction of the Hankou Municipal Government, we have to recover the Japanese and French concessions at the same time.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Japan's Unemployment Bonds</h3>
<p>The United States has issued bonds to relieve the economy due to the unemployment problem. Japan's current cabinet has a policy of not issuing bonds, but it is now issuing more than 30 million bonds to relieve unemployment, and it is said that there is no other way to relieve unemployment except by issuing bonds. The method of the United States to relieve unemployment is to build houses, repair roads, and dig rivers to accommodate unemployed workers. Japan's method of relieving unemployment is also to use its bonds for civil engineering and railway construction. The reason is that placing people in artificial jobs cannot flow into the goods on the market, making the overabundance of products even more increased and causing the commercial world to decline even more and the economic world to suffer. This is a common sense known to everyone in the industrial and commercial countries of the world, so the methods they propose are roughly the same.</p>
<p>Although the construction and organization of all land in the countries of the world is not necessarily perfect, it is still far more advanced than China. Therefore, if China can do what other countries do today and use the unemployed people who have no work to do on roads, rivers, and all aspects of land management, it will not only accommodate countless unemployed people but also generate endless benefits that will benefit China and the people of the world. This is what we should pay attention to in today's construction plan.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>International Telecommunications Negotiations</h3>
<p>Nanjing: After two meetings on Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations, the Japanese side agreed to abandon its special rights. However, this is only a principle-based, empty article. Concrete solutions have not yet been found. Regarding the negotiations on the submarine cable of the three companies, there is disagreement on the issue of sending and receiving telegrams. However, our side's position is firm. If a new contract cannot be signed as scheduled by the end of this year when the old contract expires, the old contract will naturally be declared invalid. The next meeting is scheduled for the afternoon of the 9th, and representatives of the three companies will arrive in Beijing as scheduled. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3>Shigemitsu Aoi Visited Chiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu visited Chiang at headquarters at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th for an hour.

It is said that if Zhang Xueliang does not visit Yan after arriving in Tianjin, Yan will not visit Zhang either. According to Jia Jingde, Yan's departure date has not been determined and is currently being prepared. He will stay in Japan for a short time and then travel to Europe and the United States.

<h3>Beining Railway Decides to Purchase Large Locomotives</h3>

<h3>French Cabinet Suddenly Reorganized Government Fails in Senate Théodore Submits Resignation</h3>
<p>President Is Assessing Candidates for Successor Speakers of Both Houses Recommend Poincaré</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 4th: The French Théodore Cabinet suddenly submitted its resignation tonight, which was quite unexpected. Although there were a majority of senators in the Senate who opposed Théodore, there was no vote of no confidence. Unexpectedly, Théodore suddenly resigned. President Doumer received Théodore at 10:15 PM, accepted his resignation, and directed him to continue handling administrative affairs as usual until a new cabinet is formed. Then, he immediately convened the speakers of both houses to discuss candidates for successor. The speakers of both houses both recommended former Prime Minister Poincaré as the only person who could restore public confidence after the financial scandal. However, according to Poincaré's friends, Poincaré's health has not yet recovered and he is unable to handle complex tasks. It is feared that he will not agree to take office immediately. As for the next most likely candidate, former Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Finance Chéron is the most promising.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 5th: Today, all the morning newspapers here speculated on Théodore's failure in the Senate and his resignation. It is now said that Théodore's removal will create a situation for former Prime Minister Poincaré to make a comeback. As for Poincaré's own declaration yesterday that he would not form a cabinet, many people do not believe it deeply. As reported by the Martin newspaper, even if Poincaré himself is unwilling to take office again, he will eventually be persuaded by those around him and urged by the President to reluctantly do so. This is because the President believes that it will not be easy to resolve the current deadlock in the parliament unless Poincaré organizes a centralized cabinet. Le Journal and Le Petit Parisien also both stated that in this violent political storm, unless the highly respected Poincaré comes forward to form a cabinet, it will not be possible to reverse the situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 4th: The French Senate's opposition party impeached the government's policies today, and the government failed. The anti-Théodore faction had 147 votes, 8 more than the pro-Théodore faction. Prime Minister Théodore has resigned. The Senate was quite crowded at the time and the debate was intense. Senator Schirer attacked the government most forcefully. Théodore replied that France's economic position was stable and that although the diplomatic situation was tense, it was not serious. The government's policy towards Germany was to maintain the results of the victory and to aim for peace. As for Briand's European Federation plan, if Europe does not reorganize itself within ten years, he does not want to sacrifice much for Europe.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 5th: It is noteworthy that Justice Minister Perrier resigned on November 18th, and ten days later, Undersecretary of Public Works Fould and Undersecretary of Fine Arts Routier resigned together. Shortly after, the government's failure was heard. Perrier resigned so that he could appeal to the parliamentary committee regarding events related to the Oustric Bank collapse, and both Fould and Routier resigned in order to have complete freedom of action when summoned by the committee. Théodore firmly stated that he did not want to join the new government. It is also questionable whether Poincaré and Briand will join, so the political situation is very difficult. A new government may not be established within the next week.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Decides to Issue Unemployment Bonds</h3>
<p>34 Million Yen</p>
<p>Finance Minister Submits Request Approved</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 5th: Today's regular cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 AM.

Next, the Minister of Home Affairs urged the financial authorities to consider the implementation of the Relief Law. Next, Minister of Justice Watanabe reported on the issue of establishing judicial police officers. Minister of Communications Koizumi reported on issues such as the Child Insurance Law and the amendment of the Electric Power Business Law. Furthermore, the Minister of Finance stated that the tax reduction plan resulting from the disarmament conference is currently under study. In the end, the items to be reduced will be land rent, business income tax, and consumption taxes on sugar and textiles. Further details will be reported later. The meeting adjourned at 12:20 PM.</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 5th: Finance Minister Inoue explained the issuance of unemployment bonds at today's cabinet meeting as follows: (1) There is no other way to relieve the unemployed except by relying on public bonds. As for jobs, they are currently being studied. It is expected that civil engineering projects will be carried out, with road construction being the most suitable. For projects under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs, it is planned to raise public bonds of 22 million yen. For the purpose of implementing projects by the Ministry of Railways, it is planned to raise public bonds of 12 million yen, totaling 34 million yen in public bonds to be issued. (2) Due to the depression in the shipping industry, a total of 300,000 tons of ships are currently out of service, and 5,000 people are unemployed. Negotiations are currently underway with the Ministry of Communications, and it seems that another public bond proposal will have to be issued this year.</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 5th: At 1:30 PM today, Finance Minister Inoue met with the Emperor regarding the issuance of unemployment relief bonds decided at today's cabinet meeting and reported everything, requesting approval and answering questions before leaving.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th: The unemployment bond issuance proposed by the Ministry of Home Affairs will soon be submitted to the cabinet for decision. Some people have criticized it, saying that this is a loophole in the current cabinet's public bond policy and that there is a misunderstanding that the current cabinet will change its policies afterward. Finance Minister Inoue plans to issue a statement after the unemployment bonds are finalized to dispel misunderstandings.</p>

Furthermore, any individual proposal that could move one step forward in the direction of disarmament would also fail.

<p>Advocating for Changes in Government Agencies</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th: Thirty Labour Party members of the House of Commons have jointly issued a declaration advocating that government agencies make active changes and adopt policies to deal with the current economic situation. It is said that this declaration was written by former cabinet member Mosley. It states that the current situation should be regarded as a national emergency and that the highest power should be placed in the hands of a small group of five cabinet members, as was done during the European War. Special emergency plans should be adopted immediately to deal with issues such as roads, mines, and the cheap sale of foreign goods in the UK. Reuters, London, 4th: Today, the House of Commons voted 255 to 225 to reject the Conservative Party's motion to extend the dyestuffs case for five years. This case was passed during the European War and was limited to ten years, which will expire on January 14th. This case prohibits the import of dyestuffs from other countries unless they have special licenses. Currently, 90% of the dyestuffs consumed in the UK are made in the UK, and exports are also high. Before the war, only 20% of the dyestuffs used were made in the UK.</p>

<h3>US to Change Aviation Policy</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Washington, 4th: McNary today proposed a bill in the Senate advocating that US airplanes and airships be placed on the same footing as US seagoing vessels, so that they can directly operate to and from the United States under contract with foreign postal aviation services. The reason for this is that the development of aviation in recent years has been rapid. In the future, direct air postal travel across the Pacific Ocean will be unavoidable. Next year, the Zeppelin Company is preparing to operate a postal air service from California to Manila via Honolulu. Once this is established, it will inevitably be gradually extended to ports in Japan and China. This aviation policy, which previously did not allow any encroachment, must therefore adapt to the changes of the times.</p>

<h3>Chiang's Proclamation to the People of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>General Chiang Kai-shek has issued a proclamation to the people of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces for the eradication of the Communist bandits. The original text is recorded below: (For a year, due to the repeated uprisings against the central government, most of the troops have been transferred to the front lines, and the garrison troops in the rear have therefore become thin. As a result, the Communist bandits have been able to take the opportunity to create disturbances, actually spreading across the three provinces. In recent months, their fierce flames have intensified, coercing more and more people, daring to capture provincial capitals and occupy county towns. The villages and towns they pass through are all subjected to bloodshed, and men, women, old, and young are all slaughtered. Plundered property amounts to hundreds of millions, an atrocity that no human being can bear to do, creating a tragedy unprecedented in 200 years. It is also because the war against the central government is at a critical juncture, and it is impossible to transfer troops south for a while, which has allowed the Communist bandits to linger on. The pain of speaking about it and the anger of thinking about it cause my hair to stand on end. Now, fortunately, the rebels have been eliminated, and the war on the front lines has come to an end. The central government has dispatched various troops to encircle and suppress the bandits, and I, the Commander-in-Chief, am also personally setting out to patrol the three provinces to command the suppression and order the troops to completely eliminate the Communist bandits within the shortest possible time. With such a large army gathered and suppressed from all sides, no matter how fierce and stubborn the Communist bandits are, it will not be difficult to destroy their nests and eradicate their roots. The Communist bandits, under the guise of the Red Army, have claimed tens of thousands, but most of them are oppressed, and few are willing to do evil. Moreover, they lack bullets and supplies and live purely by looting, and most of the looted property is swallowed by their bandit leaders. The average bandit has not received a single penny for months, and they are exhausted from fleeing east and west. The number of fugitives is not small. Such a rabble, once attacked by a large army, will naturally be difficult to resist. Moreover, throughout history, there has never been a bandit party that can achieve great things by killing and setting fires, nor has there ever been a vicious and brutal villain who can escape punishment. This can be comforting to my people. There are currently three things that the government should strive to do: First, this suppression of bandits must not only eliminate the large groups, but also completely eliminate the scattered small groups. We must strive to kill their leaders, scatter their coerced followers, and eradicate their roots, so as not to allow them to have the opportunity to revive and leave future troubles for the people. Second, the people of the three provinces have suffered from their scourge for a long time, with death, displacement, and the loss of all their property. We have no time to save the dead, so how can we bear to impose burdens on them? Therefore, the salaries and supplies of all the troops suppressing the bandits have been ordered by me, the Commander-in-Chief, to be provided by the central government, and no local fundraising is allowed. Third, for the areas most severely affected by the disaster, the government should consider the situation and provide relief to enable the people who have survived the calamity to maintain their survival and gradually recover. The refugees scattered in various places should also be able to safely return to their hometowns and resume their old businesses. The people also have things that they should strive to do. First, all my people should firmly believe in the Three People's Principles and support the Kuomintang. They should not blindly believe in heresies and be incited by the Communist Party, nor should they be tempted by small profits by the Communist bandits, so as not to regret it once they take the wrong step. They should especially rise up together and fight the Communist bandits to the death. Second, since there are many bandits, it is inevitable that some scattered bandits will escape and harm the villages and towns during the large-scale encirclement and suppression. The people should unite and strictly organize themselves, prepare weapons, and seek self-defense together. They must not retreat on their own in the hope of the Communist bandits' forgiveness. They must know that the Communist bandits are extremely vicious and have no benevolence or righteousness to speak of. If I do not kill the bandits, the bandits will kill me. If they do not have the determination to fight the bandits to the death, they cannot seek a safe path to survival. If the people in all areas can unite and defend themselves, not only can the scattered bandits be eliminated, but also the entire group of Communist bandits can be easily eradicated. Third, since the Communist bandits' atrocities have caused the people such intense suffering, they should do their best to assist the troops suppressing the bandits, either as guides, reporting bandit information, or providing various conveniences to enable the troops suppressing the bandits to proceed smoothly. They must not sit idly by and be indifferent. In short, if such inhumane Communist bandits are allowed to exist any longer, it will not only be a major disaster for the country but also a disgrace to the government. I, the Commander-in-Chief, have been entrusted with the important task of the Party and the nation. The principle of suppressing bandits and pacifying the people is where my duty lies. If the Communist bandits are not eradicated in a day, my duty as Commander-in-Chief will not be fulfilled in a day. If the people are not out of the fire and water in a day, my conscience will also be uneasy for a day. Therefore, although the hard-fought war against the central government has just ended, I dare not resign from my labor and have personally set out to patrol and supervise the suppression, hoping that the general public will rise up together and unite, assist the large army on the one hand and urgently seek self-defense on the other, so that the bandits and Communists can be completely eliminated in the shortest possible time and the people of the three provinces can live and work in peace and contentment.</p>
<h3>Second Anniversary Celebration of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan of the National Government was established on December 5, 1928. As of December 5 of this year, the two-year term of the first Legislative Committee has expired and must be reappointed. At 8:00 a.m. that morning, the Yuan held a second-anniversary celebration in the auditorium. All members attended. Yuan President Hu Hanmin chaired the meeting, reporting on the general situation of legislative work over the past two years. He stated that the Yuan, based on the central political conference's decision on legislative principles and the Three People’s Principles, and relying on the efforts of the members, has strived wholeheartedly for the past two years, taking into account national conditions, popular sentiment, timeliness, spatiality, and the legal systems of various countries, playing a central role. He also expressed the greatest support from Vice President Tu Liangkou, enabling the major legal codes to be completed in sequence, fulfilling responsibilities and assuring blamelessness to the people. Therefore, today we should congratulate and thank all comrades. At the same time, he also hoped that all comrades would review the past work and encourage each other, etc. Next, representatives from the central government and the National Government, including Mr. Chonghui, delivered speeches stating that a person's status, unless criminally related to criminal law, has no connection, but from birth to death, there is a deep connection with civil law every day. This most important civil law has been entirely passed by the Legislative Yuan to meet the needs of the people. Furthermore, human survival cannot be separated from land for a single day, even if flying tens of thousands of miles, one must eventually land on Earth. Now, the Legislative Yuan has formulated the Land Law based on the principle of equalizing land rights, so that the people can share its benefits. In addition, labor-capital disputes are sufficient to create social unrest, which has a significant impact on industry and commerce. The Labor Law formulated by the Legislative Yuan is sufficient to avoid disputes and has a spirit of labor-capital cooperation. In addition, the quantity and quality of various bills and financial bills passed are truly admirable and can be said to have opened a new era in Chinese law. Although the terms of office of the members have expired, the spirit of serving the Party and the country is still hoped to continue uninterrupted, etc. Then, the various committees reported on their work separately, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Disarmament of the Detachment Stationed in Bengbu</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The detachment of the punitive army under the General Headquarters was originally a special force composed of Red Spear Society members and the People's Self-Defense Corps to contain the enemy's rear during Hu Yu's operations under the Central Army. It was a so-called "mixed army." After the end of the war, it was transferred from Guide to Bengbu for training at the beginning of last month. The first detachment, led by Zhang Yunting, was stationed in the Xiaoshan Nansi barracks, and the second detachment, led by Cui Yuting, was stationed in the Dongying barracks. The commander, Nie Xiuzhang (from Henan), was stationed in the Yanyang Guild Hall, where the headquarters was located. The entire unit consisted of only a little over a thousand officers and soldiers, with insufficient firearms and incomplete uniforms. The Nanjing General Headquarters issued 10,000 yuan in military pay each month. When stationed in Guide, military rice was also issued, but since being stationed in Bengbu, no rice has been received, and the pay has been extremely difficult to obtain. The detachment has twice borrowed 1,200 yuan from the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce. Due to poor military discipline, soldiers often drank and deserted. It happened that someone accused Deputy Commander Cheng Derong to the Nanjing General Headquarters, and he was detained in Beijing, which is likely related to this. Commander-in-Chief Chiang initially planned to incorporate the unit into the Second Teaching Division under Zhang Zhizhong and reorganize it into a supplementary regiment. The division specifically sent Qian Houzhai, acting chief of staff of the division headquarters, to Bengbu more than ten days ago to negotiate, but it was unsuccessful. Fearing that the unit would not easily comply, Commander-in-Chief Chiang telegraphed Wei Lihuang, acting division commander of the 45th Division here, to resolve the matter in Bengbu, asking if Wei's forces stationed in Bengbu were sufficient to resolve it. Wei telegraphed back, saying that they were entirely sufficient to resolve it. Yesterday (the 3rd), a telegram arrived ordering the unit to be handled properly. It happened that the unit's commander, Nie Xiuzhang, had gone to Beijing to receive supplies and had not returned. That day, Guo Guojun, chief of staff of the 45th Division, invited Pang Linbo, chief of staff of the detachment headquarters, to the division headquarters for talks, informing him of the disposal order. Pang also expressed his compliance. The 45th Division immediately ordered Long Qiwu, commander of the 268th Regiment stationed in Bengbu, and Xiao Wulang, commander of the Provisional First Regiment, to disarm the unit this morning (the 4th). At the same time, Cao Guang'e, chief of the ordnance department, and Staff Officer Song Baomo were dispatched to verify the number of personnel and firearms. At 8:00 a.m. today, Long's regiment confiscated the firearms of the second detachment in the Dongying barracks, and Xiao's regiment confiscated the firearms of the second detachment in the Xiying barracks. At that time, the officers and soldiers of the two detachments offered no resistance. A total of more than fifty rifles and one submachine gun were confiscated. After the disarmament, Cao and Song verified the numbers with the staff and adjutants of the detachment headquarters, while Long's and Xiao's regiments guarded the perimeter with armed sentries. According to the inspectors, most of the soldiers in the unit came from the fields and were of good character. During the inspection, they were happy and willing to be reorganized to avoid starvation. In addition to issuing supplies to maintain the status quo, Acting Division Commander Wei telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang to report on the process and request instructions on how to handle it. It is estimated that the unit will be incorporated into the 45th Division to fill vacancies or merged into the Second Teaching Division for reorganization. (December 4th)</p>
<h3>Central Government Holds Memorial Ceremony for the Zhaohe Uprising</h3>
<p>Today (the 5th) marks the 15th anniversary of the Zhaohe warship uprising. The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial ceremony at 7:00 a.m. Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Chen Lifu, Shao Yuanchong, Li Wenfan, Wang Boqun, Liu Luyin, Kong Xiangxi, Ma Chaojun, and other staff members attended.</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<h3>Domestic News Received</h3>
<p>A total of more than 600 people attended. Chairman Hu Hanmin presided over the ceremony, after which the chairman gave a speech, stating that since 1913, Yuan Shikai's intention to undermine the Republic of China had become increasingly apparent, but the general public still did not understand and thought that the revolution had been successful and there should be no further actions. The Party's opposition to Yuan was actually meddling. The weakness of social psychology at that time can be seen from this. Yuan Shikai took advantage of this weakness to create the theory of maintaining the status quo. This theory not only deceived the general public, but even outstanding members of society and other political parties believed it without doubt. Thus, Yuan was able to do whatever he wanted, borrowing foreign debt of 250 million yuan without the approval of the National Assembly to deal with revolutionary forces. Mr. Chen Yingzhi, with his spirit of fighting for revolutionary work (being the quickest to initiate and the latest to retreat in times of failure) and unique insights, loudly appealed to the public. It was not until the discovery of the Preparatory Society for Establishing Peace and the Zhaohe warship uprising that everyone realized Yuan's imperial ambitions and believed in the Party's rationale for opposing Yuan, understanding Mr. Chen's extraordinary insights. Although there is not much to say about the Zhaohe uprising on the surface, its impact was significant. The righteous armies of Yunnan, Guangdong, and other places rose up, and the suppression of Yuan was eventually successful. This was truly due to the Zhaohe uprising. This battle truly occupies a glorious page in the history of the revolution. The Party's spirit of safeguarding the Republic of China was further fully demonstrated. Then, Committee Member Shao Yuanchong reported on the course of the Zhaohe uprising, stating that although the Zhaohe uprising did not achieve much significant success, it could demonstrate the spirit of our revolutionary party, which only considers right and wrong and disregards interests. The Premier said that he did not hope that the revolution would be completed in his lifetime, but wished that once the seeds were sown, there would be a day of flowering and bearing fruit. The Zhaohe uprising was the implementation of this idea. Although the reactionary forces have been eliminated, we must not be complacent and should always maintain a spirit of struggle to complete our mission. After Shao's report, the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Fan Yichun of Qibao Escapes Safely: Fan Yichun, manager of the Qianyuan distillery outside the east gate of this city, whose father, Chunhua, opened two Yongji distilleries in Qibao, used to travel back and forth to take care of the store. It was rumored the other day (the 1st) that he was intercepted and dragged away by four people in a limousine near the Guanyintang in Qibao. Yesterday, various newspapers carried the news, and his relatives and friends were shocked. In fact, Fan Yichun was indeed searched by people in that area on the 1st, but he suffered no losses and returned to Songjiang safely by taking a bus from Xinzhuang. It has now been confirmed that the Yongji store in Qibao has sent a letter to inform them. The Increase in Capital of Fragrant Workers Has Been Temporarily Suspended: Fragrant industry workers recently rose up to demand wage increases from various shopkeepers, suspending work temporarily each day to wait for a resolution. The shopkeepers believe that it is difficult to increase wages by six cents at a time when business is sharply reduced and food costs are high. Moreover, colleagues in the industry have recently lacked unity, secretly reducing prices to compete with each other, while the wholesale price of raw materials has gradually increased, making it difficult to continue. While labor and capital were negotiating, some workers suspected that a certain shopkeeper's words were exaggerated, leading to mutual questioning and causing unnecessary complications. With Wu Jinchun mediating, a consensus can be reached and work can be resumed.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Re-education Institute is Actively Preparing: Because the 60,000 yuan stipulated by the ministry for the expenses of the Jiangsu Re-education Institute has not yet been allocated, and the 20,000 yuan from the provincial government has also not been allocated, the housing project has been delayed. President Lin of the High Court now considers that re-education institutes in various places have been established one after another, and political prisoners often associate with criminals involved in other homicide and theft cases, which is not a prudent approach. He specifically convened a meeting yesterday (the 5th) afternoon with preparation members Shi Zechen, Chen Ludan, Zhu Zhongqi, Yao Guozhang, and others. As a result, it was decided that only some of the houses in the old copper coin bureau needed to be repaired, and more than 30 houses would be started within this month so that the institute could be established as scheduled on March 1 next year. The reconstruction of the others will be tendered after the provincial and ministerial funds arrive.</p>
<p>The President of Jiangdu Court is Accused: Chen Ruizhen, President of the Jiangdu County Court, and the provincial chief prosecutor have recently been jointly accused by people from the county of dereliction of duty to the High Court. According to the report, President Lin yesterday ordered the chief prosecutor of the Zhenjiang Local Court to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<p>Striving to Postpone the Jiangsu Construction Public Bonds: Zhang Yiqing and other gentry from Wuxian, Wujiang, Changshu, and Kunshan counties previously submitted a joint report to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating that the issuance of 7 million yuan in Jiangsu Construction Public Bonds imposed the largest quotas on Wuxian and other counties, which the people could not afford. Moreover, the use of these public bonds to carry out water conservancy construction in Jiangbei was a painful experience of taking flesh to mend sores. They specifically submitted a joint report to the Jiangsu Provincial Government requesting the exemption of the four counties. The Suzhou General Chamber of Commerce also telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance on the 5th, requesting a postponement and sending letters to the chambers of commerce of various counties to strive together.</p>
<p>Telegraphing to Repeal the Business Tax Registration Fee: The Suzhou General Chamber of Commerce stated that Jiangsu Province is holding business tax collection registration fees, drawing 2/1000 based on the amount of capital, and has set up an office in the county finance bureau to start operating on the 5th. It specifically telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating that the central government has determined the time limit for abolishing likin, and the business tax must be implemented. Please forward the message to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to repeal the regulations for collecting registration fees to stop the implementation and alleviate the business difficulties.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Director of the Construction Bureau Resigns: Sun, Director of the Construction Bureau of this county, was transferred to Songjiang. Zhang Shuihong, a representative of the provincial government, succeeded him. However, Zhang had not been in office for long before he suddenly sent a quick telegram to the Provincial Construction Department to resign. It is said that the reason for his resignation was that Zhang himself did not consider himself familiar with construction work and suffered from hemoptysis.</p>
<p>Robbery Case of Jia Zheng of the Fourth Regiment Warehouse: Last night, seven or eight bandits suddenly came to the home of Tang Shengrong, Jia Zheng of the Fourth Regiment Warehouse, first tied Tang and his wife with hemp ropes, and then went to various rooms to search. It is estimated that clothing, jewelry, silver, and other items were robbed, with losses of about 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Zhou Huiren is Accused of Embezzling School Funds from the Education Bureau: Zhou Huiren, a school rent collector, has served for more than 20 years. It is said that he misappropriated more than 2,000 yuan in accumulated school rent collected. Yesterday, the Education Bureau accused him of embezzling school funds. He was summoned by the county and confessed to the misappropriation. He was immediately detained and secured.</p>
<p>New Party Consolidation Committee Member Assumes Office in Nanhui: Wang Yueping, a member of the County Party Consolidation Committee and deputy director of the Relief Institute, was removed from his position and sent to a vacancy by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Consolidation Committee due to a case of corruption in the institute. It is learned that Pan Yu has arrived at the meeting yesterday to take over.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Silk Industry Public Bonds Approved for Issuance: Due to the sharp decline in sales and stagnant sales in silk factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, the entire industry is in an extremely depressed state, almost collapsing. All members of the industry initiated the organization of a special committee to request the government to issue 10 million yuan in silk industry public bonds and appointed representatives to petition in Beijing. It has now been approved by the government, which has also instructed the Deputy Minister of Finance to be responsible for planning and carefully issuing the public bonds. The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Silk Industry Relief Special Committee considered that since the public bonds had been approved by the government, the method of allocation and repayment should be discussed urgently. Therefore, a meeting was held in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Attendees included Wang Xiaolai, Shen Chenchen, Huang Chenchen, and Wang Dingfan from Shanghai; Fang Bingruo, Zhang Zizhen, Yang Yuchu, and Qian Fenghao from Suzhou; and Jiang Laixian and Zhu Kexian from Zhejiang. The results of the two-day meeting were that the allocation method would be based on the number of looms, with approximately 200 yuan allocated per loom. However, the issue of how to repay the funds in the future is crucial. Although the method discussed was discussed for a long time over the course of two days, the previously agreed-upon method still needs to be modified and cannot be finalized. It was agreed that it would be discussed at length at the next meeting. The representatives from Wuxi returned home yesterday one after another to inform their colleagues of the situation.</p>
<p>All Silk Factories in Wuxi Remain Idle: Unfortunately, due to the incitement of a small number of troublemakers, a major labor strike broke out on the 2nd, causing all 45 silk factories in the county to go on strike. It is learned that County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia believes that the workers' unjustified strike has disrupted order and that external reactionary elements are inciting it. In addition to ordering the police to strictly arrest them, he has also posted notices prohibiting all gatherings and gatherings while the labor strike is unresolved, and those who violate the order will be arrested and interrogated. At the same time, he has ordered Director Xu of the Public Security Bureau and Captain Wang of the Police Brigade to strictly guard against it. It is said that in order to test the background of this labor strike, County Magistrate Pan has not only interrogated the arrested men and women in detail but has also persuaded the silk factories in Zhoushanbang to resume work first. When the time comes, a large number of police officers will be sent to protect them. If anyone comes to make trouble again, they will be dealt with appropriately. However, all silk factories remain closed, and the County Workers' Consolidation Committee has organized a propaganda team to visit various factory areas to talk and promote the results. The County Party Department has specifically promoted Committee Member Chen (Zhenbang) to the provincial government to report on the progress of the situation. In order to prevent the recurrence of the strike and to easily suppress it, Director Xu of the Public Security Bureau has specially mobilized the heads of various sub-bureaus, each sub-bureau drawing one patrol leader and ten police officers to gather at the Public Security Bureau to await orders. Yesterday, all silk factories in the county still did not resume operations and continued to suspend work, waiting for the official authorities to resolve the matter. At around 11:00 a.m., a group of about 200 female workers gathered in the city to discuss the matter, but the meeting was prevented by the police. However, according to the female workers, they are now determined not to resume work until there is a satisfactory solution. It is observed that the attitude of the female workers is very gentle, but it is still difficult to resume work for the time being.</p>
<p>An Unprecedented Case of Bride Kidnapping: In Zhengjiadang, near Yuqi Town in the 15th District (Qingcheng City) of the county, Chen Sun, the daughter of Sun Zheng, married Chen Luying at the age of twenty-one. They had been married for fifteen years, and the couple lived in harmony. However, Chen Luying died of illness in the winter of the year before last, and Chen Sun has been a widow at home ever since. Recently, Wei Axi, a Taoist priest, conspired with the deceased's brothers, Chen Luzhen and Chen Lurong, to kidnap the widow Chen Sun in the middle of the night the day before yesterday and hide her in a room, forcing her to marry. Afterwards, her mother, Sun Zheng, reported to Zou Qinglin, the chief of the 15th Public Security Sub-Bureau, who sent police to arrest Wei Axi, Chen Luzhen, Chen Lurong, and others, a total of three people, and sent them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation yesterday. In addition, Duan Qishan, the chief of the 6th Public Security Sub-Bureau in Zhoushanbang, Guangle District, outside Guangfu Gate, also reported the other day that Zhang Amao and Lu Aqi came to the bureau to report that on May 15 of the year before last, Zhang A泉 had arranged the marriage of his sister to a Chen family in Dongting Town, receiving 100 yuan in wedding money. In June of this year, the matchmaker Zhang A泉 came to the house and said that the wedding gift and auspicious date had not been finalized. Unexpectedly, the Chen family used bride kidnapping, leading Lu Aqi and twenty others to kidnap the sister into a boat. Duan, the chief of the sub-bureau, immediately presented the case to the general bureau and requested that it be severely punished according to the law.</p>
<p>Verdict Reached in the Murder Case on Dai Lane: Guo Zizhen, a resident of Dai Lane on Furong Mountain in the 6th District (Tianxia City), was killed by local villagers using hoes and other implements on March 24 of the year before last. After the incident, the county government arrested the murderers, Zhang Apan and others, and detained them. Yesterday, Judge Liang presented Zhang and the other five criminals in court to announce the verdict. The principal offender, Zhang Apan, was sentenced to eleven years in prison, and Dai Zhaosheng, Ni Apeipei, and Ni Rongpei were each sentenced to five years in prison. Dai Shoubiao was acquitted.</p>
<p>Theft and Arson by Bandits in Taibo City: The Qian family ancestral hall in Yanghandang Beach, in the 12th District (Taibo City), was guarded by Huang Axiao. In addition to guarding the tomb, Huang also farmed to make a modest living. On the night before last, six or seven bandits suddenly broke into the house with weapons, tying up Huang Axiao's wife and daughter with ropes. Then, they robbed and left. Before leaving, the bandits set fire to the entire ancestral hall and burned a water buffalo to death. The rice stalks on the threshing floor (totaling eight mu of land) were also completely destroyed. When the fire started, the bound people were rescued by neighbors, and their lives were spared.

<p>The Communist Leader Tang Huanran is Captured: Tang Huanran (aka Yixinzhuang, a 29-year-old doctor), an important communist leader in the Zhuanghang communist bandits' arson and looting case, has not been captured by the military and police until now. This time, the bandit suddenly sneaked back to his hometown, hoping to reignite the fire. On the night of the 3rd of this month, he led a group to rob the home of Cao Runjun, a doctor in the west of Zhangjiatang Town. It happened that Yang Xingsheng, the captain of the Third Police Platoon stationed in Zhuanghang, and the Eighth Public Security Sub-Bureau were searching for a bandit den at No. 32 near the area. Upon hearing the gunshots, they immediately led the police to investigate. Unexpectedly, they approached Cao's corner, and the bandits who were on the lookout resisted. Fortunately, Yang was prepared and crawled forward valiantly, rushing in and capturing the bandit Tang and killing one bandit. The head of the bandit was cut off and brought back for public display. The four policemen escorted the bandit Tang through the streets, and a large crowd watched. The bandit Tang's face did not change color, and he called out the names of acquaintances to pay his respects. He also confessed at the team headquarters that he was a member of the Communist Party and was in charge of arson and looting in Zhuanghang, admitting it without hesitation. Now, the people of Zhuanghang are deeply hurt and hate him as if cutting off a limb. Therefore, after the bandit was sent to the south at 3:00 p.m. on the 4th, they requested the Eight District Public Office to forward the request to the county government, demanding that he be sent back to the scene of the crime to be executed by shooting as soon as possible to serve as a warning. As for the suspects A-Mei, Zhou Asi, and Zhang Quan, an informant, who were arrested in another case that night, they are still temporarily detained at the team headquarters because of insufficient evidence, pending investigation.</p>

<p>Endless Extortion Letters: (1) It is said that Feng Huajie, an Anhui native residing inside the Luo General's Gate in this city, has pawned out his family property and is now managing packages at Zhenjiang Yuchang Pawnshop. Nearing forty years of age, he still lacks an heir. Three years ago, he bought a girl from the north as a concubine. The following year, she gave birth to a son. Now, the concubine and son live inside Luo General's Gate. Thugs, considering Feng's family affluent, have been sending letters of extortion from time to time. Recently, they sent three letters in a row demanding 1,000 yuan to be delivered to the foot of the tree in Luyang Village outside the North Gate, or else they would kidnap his son and burn his house. (2) Xia Zhengyuan of Xianggua Lane in Xu Gate also received an extortion letter the other day demanding a large sum of money. The first letter instructed him to contact a person wearing a black jacket and a yellow hat, holding a lantern in his left hand, at Wanfu Bridge outside the East Gate.

<p>Kidnapped Wife Returned but Denies Former Husband: Cai, the wife of Zhang Pengli from Xujiaqiao in the western countryside of this county, secretly ran away this summer in June, taking with her the marriage certificate of her marriage to Zhang. Later, Zhang learned that his wife had been having an affair with Xu Biliang from the same village for a long time and that Xu's clansman, Fuquan, had colluded in the abduction and escaped to Shanghai. Zhang's father, Buchao, went to Shanghai to search for her everywhere and successfully found his daughter-in-law and brought her back to Yangzhou. However, his daughter-in-law denied having an affair with Xu and denied being married to Zhang. It is reported that Zhang's father and son have filed a report with the Public Security Bureau to arrest the adulterer and the person who colluded in the abduction and send them to court for punishment.</p>
<h3>Yangzhong</h3>
<p>Director of Education Bureau Resigns: The main sources of funding for education in Yangzhong County are reed taxes and land surtaxes, totaling about 18,000 taels of silver annually. Each tael carries a local surtax of 2 jiao and 1 fen for education (excluding public security fees, etc.). The land surtax of 1 yuan per mu can generate over 21,000 yuan. In theory, this is sufficient for maintenance, but due to years of accumulated debt, the burden is heavy. This spring, Director Wang Huankun took office and immediately organized a committee to clear the arrears. On the revenue side, he tried to improve collections, such as managing school clan properties, fighting for the school rents of Beisha and Jinzhou, and sending personnel to supervise land surtax collections. He can be said to have done everything possible to increase revenue. However, due to the limitations of his authority and weak power, the properties have not yielded results, and the supervision was met with strong resistance. Now, the time limit for the spring tax collection is approaching, but only about 6,000 yuan has been collected. Schools are demanding payment of new and old debts. Every week, principals are forced to demand payment until late at night. The chief of the bureau's general affairs section, having exhausted his arguments, resigned in anger. Director Wang is also in dire straits and unable to maintain the situation, and he submitted his resignation to the provincial education department on the 2nd.</p>
<p>Ordered Former Bureau Chief to Act as Temporary Replacement: The former director of the Finance Bureau has not clearly accounted for local taxes and other funds since his departure nearly half a year ago. It is reported that the Finance Department, due to his involvement in mismanaging reed and education surtaxes, has ordered the Yangzhong County Magistrate, Xu Zujun, to order him to come to Yangzhou for accounting.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Yangzhou Receives Suspects in Robbery of a Steamboat: Zheng, the squad leader of the 23rd Squad of the Provincial Public Security Water Police Team stationed in Shaobo, previously arrested two suspects in the robbery of a steamboat, Chen Guilin and Wang Baoshan, in the town. After repeated trials by the Sixth District Headquarters, both denied the charges. The headquarters sent patrol officer Wang Baoqing to Chenjiazhuang in Shaobo to investigate and confirmed that they were law-abiding citizens. For the sake of caution, the headquarters transferred the two suspects to the county prison and sent a letter to the Yangzhou County Court requesting their extradition for trial. The Yangzhou Court has dispatched bailiffs to Gaoyou, and Judge Hu Cheng has signed the order to extradite Chen and Wang to the court to be handed over to the bailiffs for trial in Yangzhou.</p>

<h3>Jinshan</h3>
<p>Qian Family Property Dispute to be Heard Again: Qian Yunzhu, a resident of Qianwei Town in this county, passed away in the third year of the Republic (1914) without any heirs. Before his death, he had chosen Qian Mojing, the second son of his older brother Qian Shushi, as his adopted son in a will. Three members of the clan and his older brother also signed the will. After Yunzhu's death, his eldest brother, Qian Yangyuan, had designs on the estate and attempted to seize it. Qian Yunzhu's wife, Gu, urgently convened several clan elders and close relatives to add to a public will, designating Mojing as Yunzhu's heir. Over twenty people signed the document. The dispute was thus settled. Unexpectedly, last month, Gu also passed away. Qian Yangyuan again started to fight for the property, leading his wife, children, and daughters to create a scene at the funeral, even resorting to violence, almost preventing the burial from taking place. The heir, Qian Mojing, hired lawyer Li Zhi to file a lawsuit for relief. The county government held a hearing on the 14th of last month, but the defendant did not appear or defend himself. A brief hearing was held, and the case was adjourned. It has been learned that Qian Yangyuan, in collusion with Gu's younger brother, Jishi, forged a will from Gu, claiming that Qian Mowei, Yangyuan's son, should also be designated as an heir and that the family property should be divided equally. He has recently filed a response with the county. This case is now scheduled for another hearing on the 11th of this month. It is also rumored that the plaintiff, Qian Mojing, has filed a criminal lawsuit accusing the other party and Gu Jishi of forging a will, obstructing the funeral, intercepting rent, and seizing the estate. The lawyer who certified the forged will, Ye Renjian, has also been listed as a co-defendant.</p>

<h3>Annual Meeting of the China Academic Society (1)</h3>
<p>Details of the Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>The preparations for the Fourth Youth Conference of the China Academic Society have been reported previously. Members from home and abroad have arrived in Beijing from Shanghai, Zhejiang, Wuhan, Changsha, Jiangxi, Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Beiping, Tianjin, England, Japan, and other places. At 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd, members went to the Sun Yat-Sen Mausoleum to pay their respects, admire the portrait, and perform the proper rituals. After taking a photo in front of the mausoleum, they visited the school for the descendants of the deceased, where they were warmly received by the faculty and staff, who presented them with publications for commemoration.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: At 2:00 p.m., the annual meeting ceremony was held in the biology hall of Central University. The hall displayed various publications and achievements. In addition to all the staff and members of the Shanghai General Office and the Beijing Branch, more than 150 representatives from over twenty branches attended. Central Committee members He Yingqin and Hu Hanmin (represented by Zuo Gong), Education Minister Jiang Menglin (represented by Zhao Naiquan), Personnel Minister Zhang Nanxian, Beijing Mayor Wei Daoming (represented by Zhang Yuhai), and Beijing Education Bureau Director Zhang Zhongdao all attended to provide guidance. Guests included Xie Guansheng, Wu Guan, Wang Depu, Cheng Qibao, Li Yuanbai, Chen Shihong, and foreign guests such as Ke Wuke, totaling dozens of people. The event was a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Dai Jitao, one of the original chairmen of the presidium, was unable to attend due to illness and telegraphed the society to explain his absence. During the meeting, Wang presided over the ceremony, with music playing. The opening address of the chairman, the instructions of the Central Committee members and the Minister of Education, the speeches of the guests, the speeches of the members, and the chairman's reply are briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>Wang Liangchou's opening address: The gist of the address was that Premier Sun Yat-Sen said, "Revolution requires profound knowledge, and construction requires even more profound knowledge." The members have been engaged in academic research and cultural promotion for fifteen years, despite the war and social unrest in China. This shows the fighting spirit of the members. The fact that the members are seeking knowledge through academic means to realize the construction of a new China is putting into practice Sun Yat-Sen's ideas. However, the society has been established for fifteen years, and this is only the fourth annual meeting, which is due to the unrest in China. Now that the rebellion has been quelled and the foundation for unification has been laid, it should be possible to hold an annual meeting every year to complete the work of saving the country through academics.</p>
<p>He Yingqin's personal instructions: The gist of the instructions was that our country has a vast territory, abundant resources, and a long history of culture, but the people do not know how to study it, resulting in backwardness in culture and economy. Now there are people who do not know how to be vigilant and say that our material civilization is not as good as Europe and the United States, but our spiritual civilization is far superior to the West. In fact, our spiritual civilization is far inferior to Europe and the United States. For example, the people of Western countries can observe order and pay attention to conduct even in the smallest events, while the social morality of the Chinese people is really too inattentive. Saving the country depends on academics, and your society bears a great responsibility for the future material construction and spiritual construction. I hope you will all work hard.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Central Committee member Hu Hanmin, representing Zuo Gong, Education Minister Jiang Menglin, representing Zhao Naiquan, and guests delivered speeches. Members also spoke. Shi Weihuan delivered a reply. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Evening Banquet: After the meeting, the entire group went to the Central Hotel for a banquet. The chairman, Ou Yuanhuai, presided. Guests included Wang Boqun, Sun Ke (represented by Liang Han), Wu Nanxuan representing the Central Political School, Zhu Binyuan representing the China Economic Society, and reporters Zhang Peiyu and Tang San from the Beijing and Shanghai newspapers. After the chairman's speech, members and guests spoke successively. Representatives from various branches of the society reported on the society's affairs. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and the banquet ended at around 9:00 p.m.</p>

The character is then inspected according to the number. This is extremely convenient. It is said that Mr. Ye has experimented with it in nearby elementary schools many times with good results. He is currently working on improvements and will soon publish a (Explanation of the Four-Week Head Counting Character Inspection Method). Inquiries can be sent to 95 Kader Road, Shanghai, and they will be forwarded.</p>
<h3>Eighteenth Anniversary of Kwong To Academy</h3>
<p>The Kwong To Academy of Shanghai held its eighteenth anniversary celebration cum victory celebration for winning the Municipal Elementary School Joint Games three times at the Baixing Grand Theater on Fuxing Road the day before yesterday (the 4th). The event was attended by He Keshu, Section Chief of the Shanghai Education Bureau, Li Dachao, school faculty and students, totaling more than one thousand people. At half past nine in the morning, the meeting commenced with music and formalities. Following this, the school principal (also the founder of the school), Lu Songqian, gave a brief report stating that the school was founded in the third year of the Republic of China and has grown from twenty-seven students to nine hundred and forty-five. He divided the history of the school into four periods: the initial period from the second to the sixth year of the Republic of China, the stabilization period from the seventh to the eleventh year, the construction period from the twelfth to the sixteenth year, and the development period from the seventeenth year onwards. He also mentioned that the school is currently planning a large-scale expansion, intending to build a magnificent middle school campus near Jiangtao, hoping to realize this in the near future. Next, Li Heshu gave a speech, mentioning that the school had to strive for eighteen years to achieve today's excellent results and hoped that they would continue their efforts to add a unique color to the schools of our country. Li Dachao's speech emphasized the preciousness of Guangdong's national character and how the Kwong To Academy could occupy an important position among primary and secondary schools nationwide due to the great strength emanating from the Guangdong people. Finally, awards were given to the athletes, followed by various academic performances by the school's students. The meeting adjourned at half past twelve. In the afternoon, the school also exhibited the achievements of the elementary school department on campus. In the evening, all faculty and staff members, along with alumni, held a dinner party at the Guanzhen Restaurant to celebrate.</p>

<h3>Western Football Association Secretary Talks About Cao Guicheng's Qualifications</h3>
<p>Temporarily Unable to Participate in Matches</p>
<p>Shanghai and Hong Kong Associations are One Entity</p>
<p>Cao Guicheng came to Shanghai from Hong Kong to play for the Chinese team. The Western newspapers questioned this and wrote extensively, saying that a player whose qualifications had been suspended could actually play. In order to clarify the attitude of the Shanghai Football Association towards Mr. Cao, the reporter visited the association's secretary, Haimsheng, and recorded his remarks as follows: Haim said that Cao participated in the last match, and the association did not know about it beforehand and could not stop it in time. However, it has been decided that he cannot participate temporarily, and he cannot participate in today's match. The Shanghai and Hong Kong associations belong to the London General Association. There is no reason why his qualifications can be revoked by the Hong Kong side but he can play in Shanghai. The reporter asked again if there were no problems with other Chinese players, why Cao was treated differently. Haim said that other players had not been punished by the Hong Kong or Shanghai associations, and if there were, they should be dealt with according to regulations. However, the Shanghai Association has decided to review his qualifications first. As for the review method and whether it involves other Chinese players, he said that the decision of the committee cannot be disclosed to reporters at this time.</p>

The strength of each team this time is substantial. The Chinese team has an average level of talent and should maintain its championship position.

<h3>Xiqing Basketball Match Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhonggong Wins Laoda (Group A) 26 to 13</p>
<p>Pirates Win Also (Group A) 47 to 22</p>
<p>Zhenru Wins Pirates (Group A) 54 to 20</p>
<p>The Xiqing Basketball Association had three games last night starting at 7:00 PM, all in Group A. Also fought hard, and the Pirates game was one of the most exciting scenes of the night. In addition, Zhonggong's win over Laoda and Zhenru's win over the Pirates were hardly exciting.</p>
<h3>Zhonggong Wins Laoda (Group A)</h3>
<p>Zhonggong's Chen Baoqiu scored first, and his teammate Wei Zuochan followed with four points. Laoda's Liu Ruisheng bravely took the lead and won back a goal, after which it turned into a melee with few good performances. However, Zhonggong's inner guards were excellent, so the forwards had more opportunities to attack. In the first half, Zhonggong had twelve points and Laoda had six points. In the second half, Laoda improved slightly, once reaching a score of twelve to seventeen. In the end, Zhonggong launched a large-scale offensive like a bamboo shoot, resulting in a 26-13 victory over Laoda.</p>

<h3>Pirates Win Also (Group A)</h3>
<p>The Pirates were more skilled and stronger, and under the confrontation, their momentum was very strong. Also lost their footing and could not plan, and in the blink of an eye, the Pirates had gained as many as thirteen points, while Also had not scored at all. Fortunately, Liu Guorong made a long shot and the ball went in, which was the beginning of Also's scoring. By the end of the first half, Wu and Guan had each made contributions, resulting in a score of 12 to 24 in the first half. Also's performance in the second half was better, although it was difficult to have any hope of surpassing, they were in a relative momentum. In the end, the Pirates won Also 47 to 22.</p>

<h3>Zhenru Wins Pirates (Group A)</h3>
<p>The battle between Zhenru and Pirates was the last scene of last night. As soon as the two teams opened, they saw chaotic scenes. After the Pirate's Deng Na failed to hit the free throw, he threw it into the basket and scored. After Zhenru's Cai Lizhong scored a goal, although Zhenru took the victory, the results were not good. Fortunately, the Pirate's skills were mediocre, and they were still able to be in the limelight for a while. In the first eight minutes, Zhenru's score was limited. By the end of the first half, the forwards had doubled their points and added up, resulting in a score of 22 to 10 in the first half. In the second half, all the troops except the captain Zhang Qiying were replaced by reserve troops. The results of the new troops were impressive, and the Pirates retreated and were overwhelmed. After ten minutes, the first-line figures re-entered the field. Since then, the Pirates have been incomplete and their offense and defense have been misaligned. As a result, Zhenru sailed smoothly and soon won the Pirates by a score of 54 to 20.</p>

<h3>Shu Hong Dereliction of Duty as Referee, Referee Association to Hold Meeting to Express Opinion</h3>
<p>Scheduled to be held next Tuesday</p>
<p>The Chinese Sports Referee Association believes that basketball referee Shu Hong did not seriously perform his referee duties during the opening day of the Chinese Women's Basketball Association on the day before yesterday, and his job was sloppy and perfunctory. It is deeply feared that this trend will have a great impact on the future of the Chinese Sports Referee Association. Therefore, the Referee Association will hold a meeting next Tuesday to express its opinion.</p>
<h3>Explanation of the Dispute between Guanghua and Fudan in the Jiangnan University Football Match</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Guanghua University Sports Association sent a letter saying: Dear Editor, I would like to inform you that I have read a news item in your newspaper on December 4th about the football match between Fudan and our school, which stated that (during the competition, a Fudan player fell on a Guanghua spectator while carrying the ball along the sidelines. The Guanghua student punched him, and Guanghua player Xi Qiaosheng also came forward to help beat the Fudan student. The Fudan cheerleading squad came forward to mediate). According to the facts, when Mr. Xi Qiaosheng won a goal, he dribbled past the forward line. Fudan's left full-back Xie Guozhu chased him from behind, but the ball had already rolled out of bounds. Unexpectedly, Mr. Xie suddenly and intentionally kicked Mr. Xi from behind. Mr. Xi did not have time to give way, resulting in mutual accusations. Therefore, the audience was in an uproar and took sides. A spectator rushed into the field and pushed Xie away. Xi then quietly left, although Mr. Xi was physically injured, he did not show any resistance and tried to mediate. A part of the audience crowded forward, shouting to hit him, and the whole field was in chaos. Someone fired several shots and injured Guanghua alumnus Yang Zuti's hand. Our schoolmates know the importance of the big picture and do not want to damage the friendship between the two schools over minor matters. Several of our schoolmates resolved the conflict and restored order. This is the real situation at the time. We hope that your newspaper will publish it so that our schoolmates can express their feelings of indignation. We are sincerely pleased. Sincerely, Guanghua University Sports Department, December 5th.</p>

<h3>Aftermath of the Jiangnan University Cross-Country Race</h3>
<p>Jiaotong University Telephone Clerk: Never Participated</p>
<p>The Fifth Jiangnan University Cross-Country Race was scheduled to be held at the Jiangwan Chizhi at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday (i.e., the 4th) with the participation of eight universities. Unfortunately, the weather was bad and it was windy and rainy. Jiaotong University was unable to participate. According to the report, they gave up. It is now learned that the reason for their absence was indeed due to a telephone error due to the rain. The chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Wang Zhensheng, did not notify them to stop the race that day, but the misunderstanding of the hearing in the Jiaotong University phone call believed that the race had been stopped due to rain, so they did not participate. Later, the captain of the Jiaotong University team met with Wang and learned that this was indeed a misunderstanding. However, the die was cast and there was no way to recover. Jiaotong University can only admit that it suffered a loss. It is known that Jiaotong University's cross-country team has been quite good over the years, and this year they had already prepared to win the championship. Who knew that this misunderstanding would occur?</p>

<h3>Words of Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Yu Jie</p>
<p>Living people stand upright on the ground, while dead people lie horizontally underground. Therefore, while alive, people should stand upright, not horizontally, stand tall, do not groan and sigh on the bed.</p>
<p>The Buddha said that ignorance leads to action, meaning the creation of various karmic deeds. Action leads to consciousness, meaning that karmic forces pull the eight consciousnesses into reincarnation. Consciousness leads to name and form, meaning that once in the womb, all five aggregates are complete. Name and form lead to the six entrances, meaning that the six sense organs are formed, ready to enter the world. The six entrances lead to contact, meaning that after leaving the womb, the six sense organs come into contact with the six sense objects. Contact leads to sensation, sensation leads to love, love leads to grasping, grasping leads to existence, existence leads to birth, and birth leads to old age and death. This cycle of twelve interdependent origination covers the causes and effects of the three lifetimes and is in constant rotation. This is the door of flowing, which is truly the highest philosophy. Those who are deluded and follow it suffer in the three evil paths. Those who awaken and transform it transcend and ascend to the realm of Buddhahood. Shallow scholars slander it as absurd, revealing their own ignorance.</p>
<p>The female vulva is also called the gate of birth. Mayflies and midges often die immediately after mating. People also lose their lives because of lust, so it is also known as the gate of death. From this, one can understand the root of life and death of mankind.</p>
<p>Material civilization is the precursor to the destruction of mankind. Only the learning of Buddhism and Taoism is sufficient to avert it.</p>
<p>The streetcar tickets sold daily in Shanghai, when strung together, could encircle the entire area of Jiangsu Province several times.</p>
<p>Breathing that originates from love is of immense power.</p>
<p>Turning hardened steel into a gentle touch is the chemistry invented by lovers.</p>
<h3>On Fountain Pens - A Centennial Retrospective</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Although the exact date of the fountain pen's invention for slanted and ascending writing is unknown, it has been present on the desks of overseas scholars for a hundred years. It was in 1830 that Penley and Mason transported self-made pens from Birmingham to London for display and sale, which marked the beginning of the fountain pen's discovery by society.</p>
<p>Before the invention of the fountain pen, quill pens held a significant position in writing. The tip of the quill had to be sharpened frequently, so ancient scholars always carried a small knife with them. Although times have changed and this is no longer necessary, the habit has persisted, and small knives are still commonly worn by many students, perhaps because they have not forgotten their ancestors.</p>
<p>The earliest fountain pens probably existed before 1830, but no one in society paid attention to them at the time. According to records, pens appeared in England in 1748, but it was not until they were manufactured in Birmingham after 1830 that they gradually became practical. The initial pen shape did not have a nib like the current pens. They were long, thin steel tubes with wooden handles. The better ones could be used for drawing and had many patterns, but the manufacturing was roughly the same. Around 1830, the average price of an ordinary fountain pen was one shilling, which was much more expensive than a quill pen at half a penny. However, with the advent of fountain pens, quill pens gradually disappeared. The reason for this was nothing more than their durability and longevity. In Birmingham alone, the total number of fountain pens produced in 1850 reached four million. By 1892, it had increased to thirteen million. Since then, fountain pens and typewriters have emerged one after another, and the fountain pen business has been slightly affected, but annual sales still reach seven million.</p>
<h3>A Record of Two Painters, Old and Young</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Wei Ruosou, of Hengyang, is seventy years old, with white hair and a lively spirit. He is skilled in poetry and calligraphy, and is on par with the late Zeng Nongran. In recent years, he has been quietly studying painting in Shanghai. His brushstrokes are ancient, serene, refined, and full of charm. Even those who have been in this field for a long time sigh that they are not as good. Because what he has accumulated is deep, it is also the height that ordinary history cannot reach. He is forthright and honest, and he responds to every request. Recently, he painted a set of album pages for each of his three sons and four sons-in-law as a permanent commemoration.</p>
<p>Hu Ruosi, of Dantu, is only fifteen years old and is a disciple of Zhang Shanzi and Zhang Daqian of the Da Feng Tang. His painting talent is natural, and he can paint anything, including landscapes, figures, flowers, and birds. His brushstrokes are unrestrained and bold, directly approaching the seat of Da Diji and Bada, and his delicate craftsmanship is comparable to that of Shi Fu and Liuru. Whether plain and natural or gorgeous, he is versatile and skillful in both ancient and modern styles, and he is amazing to see and hear. The younger generation is to be feared, and the older generation will only feel ashamed.</p>
<p>Recently, Wei Ruosou initiated a public exhibition of 120 of Ruosi's daily works at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on December 5th for five days. In addition to the works of his teacher, there are many works imitating ancient masters, all of which are lifelike in both form and spirit. Before the exhibition, the Da Feng Tang hosted a banquet for famous calligraphers and painters in Shanghai and famous figures in the press at Tao Lechun. Ruosou personally entertained them. The old and the young complemented each other, and the Zhang brothers were happy that their disciples were talented and had many peach and plum trees. Recalling last year, Yu and Daqian once traveled to Japan with Ruosi, and the people of that country were greatly shocked. The Asahi Shimbun regarded him as a genius. I know that once this exhibition opens, the Shanghai art world will be shocked no less than the Three Islands.</p>
<h3>What Day Is It Today?</h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>What day is it today? It is the day that the memorial monument to Mr. Su Yunshang, the former headmaster of my alma mater, Minli Middle School, will be unveiled. During his lifetime, Mr. Su, with the proceeds of his merchant activities, established Minli with his younger brother, Mr. Yingjie. He never relaxed in managing and operating it. As he was about to pass away, he still earnestly entrusted the task of supporting the school and not letting it fall. Minli is truly the crystallization of Mr. Su's heart and soul for more than a decade. Now, Mr. Su's grave is covered with grass, but the school is thriving and advancing without end. Students from all over the world are returning to it like water flowing. Tens of thousands of graduates are serving society. All the schoolmates, thinking of the source of the water, cannot forget Mr. Yunshang's hard work in building the school in those years. Therefore, they voluntarily contributed funds to build a monument in his memory. The inscription was written by my teacher, Mr. Sun Jingsheng. Reflecting on the past and thinking about the present, emotions are revealed in the words. I feel deeply moved when I read it.</p>
<h3>A Night at Mother Chen's Birthday Opera</h3>
<p>— Chen Ruhong</p>
<p>At the end of last month, a grand banquet was held at the residence on Route Tenant to celebrate the 82nd birthday of the mother of Chen Tiaoyuan, the Chairman of Anhui Province. Famous opera singers from Shanghai and Mei Lanfang, who had just returned from a celebrated tour of the New World, were invited to perform. I arrived at the venue at about 9 o'clock, just as Xue Yanqin's "Yu Tang Chun" began. Her singing and acting skills were barely satisfactory, but she was worthy of being a top female performer. Next was Tan Fuying's "Catching and Releasing Cao" and Wang Fengqing's "Taking Chengdu". Tan and Wang were direct descendants of the Tan and Wang schools, each with their own strengths. It was a pleasure to hear them. The finale was Mei Lanfang and Gu Chuanjie's "Qi Shuang Hui". Lanfang played Gui Zhi with sweet voice and delicate expressions, making people never tired of listening and watching. His mastery was beyond words. In addition, Chuanjie played Zhao Chong, which was even more perfect. Chuanjie is the first-class Kunqu singer and actor, with excellent singing, acting, and appearance. His demeanor was graceful and handsome, and he can be called the best. He matched Lanfang perfectly, just like the saying in "Qi Shuang Hui": (A match made in heaven and earth). The performance was vivid and colorful, and the guests were fascinated. The three encores were even more energetic and humorous, making everyone happy. The applause was thunderous. That day, the Chen residence specially closed a room for Mei and Gu to do their makeup. After the performance, I talked with them for a while and found Lanfang to be gentle, elegant, humble, and courteous. This is why he is successful. I hope that Chuanjie will follow Lanfang's example and his future is immeasurable. I heard that Lanfang has an agreement with Chuanjie to go north together, and I can't help but applaud. However, it is unpredictable whether there will be a problem with Chuanjie leaving the New Yuefu.</p>
<h3>Minor Problems (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhenduo</p>
<p>— On Mr. Yang Xingshu's Speech —</p>
<p>The minds of us Chinese are no less intelligent than others, but we lack the perseverance. For example, our students studying in the United States achieve excellent results. However, after graduating and returning to China, if they find no suitable jobs, they are willing to take on anything. Unlike foreigners, whose grades may sometimes even fail, but after returning to their country, they make significant contributions within ten years. Their spirit is admirable. They wholeheartedly research what they have learned, and the results are so good. But when we return to China, we become desperately anxious if we don't have a job immediately.</p>
<p>For the sake of being a so-called "literati," their outlook on life can be divided into three stages. The first stage is youth, which I call the "zealous scholar" stage. Young people, full of vitality, naturally have to shout and jump around. After surpassing this "zealous scholar" stage, they enter the middle-age stage, which is the "famous scholar" stage. In school, they can shout and jump, but after leaving school, they must think about occupying a high position in society, becoming a so-called "famous scholar" surpassing ordinary people. Moreover, these "famous scholars" have special authority and receive special treatment. Things that others cannot do, "famous scholars" can do because they have a special position in society. Thus, the so-called "elegant demeanor of famous scholars" seems very arrogant to them.</p>
<p>After this middle-age stage, they gradually enter old age, and thus the vegetarian, scripture-chanting "lay Buddhists" are produced. They may think that being a "famous scholar" in this life is not enough and that they must cultivate for the afterlife. When they meet people, they always talk about metaphysics and Buddhist scriptures. They are very comfortable and do not worry about food while practicing as "lay Buddhists."</p>
<p>Therefore, under this kind of "three scholar" outlook on life, how can a country be managed well? Farmers, workers, and merchants are trampled underfoot. Even those who advocate agriculture and industry do not engage in farming or work themselves. Of course, how can they alleviate the suffering of farmers and workers? Therefore, a call for action must at least come from personal experience.</p>
<p>Look at the current Labour Party in power in England; they themselves are workers and, of course, know the suffering of workers thoroughly.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that the smallest problem is to overthrow this "three scholar" outlook on life so that all scientific disputes can be resolved.</p>
<p>This speech draft is an old draft given by Mr. Yang at the Zhonggong (Central Public) Lecture Hall at the end of last year. Looking at it now, it has not lost its original meaning, although I have not shown it to Mr. Yang himself. However, the general idea is probably correct.</p>
<h3>Tracing Memories While Drinking Under the Flowers</h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>Master Xia Yihe of the Lanling Chrysanthemum Society, as is the custom every late autumn, hosts an elegant gathering facing the beautiful colors of the eastern fence, opening the fragrant wine from the northern sea, which is a grand event. This autumn, even more so, because society members Fei Zhe'an and I are both reaching the age of forty, and he borrows flowers to offer longevity, taking the ancient meaning of extending life with yellow chrysanthemums. This is undoubtedly Fei’s honor, while I am seeing the swift passing of time, and the useless increase of age, laughing at the yellow flowers, deeply ashamed of the early appearance of white hair, and deeply grateful for the high friendship like clouds in the sky. The week before last Sunday, Yihe invited fellow society members and famous calligraphers and painters, reaching two or thirty people. My old friends Ji Chen and Baixi and I arrived the night before. On the due date, Hu Tinglu and Rong Tiaofu, who came from Xilai, also took their seats. At the time, Fei and I took the top seats. Baixi laughed and said that Jiang Junjia was also turning thirty this year, so he was pushed to sit next to me, creating a "three stars" combination, truly like reeds leaning on jade. Looking around, there were two or three hundred pots of chrysanthemums, and the shapes and colors were all different and wonderful, truly all excellent varieties from south and east. Hanging on the screen was a painting of chrysanthemums by fellow student Fang Huqing, vividly lifelike, indistinguishable from the real thing, adding to the charm. Yihe stated that he has been fond of this for ten years, and that he is willing to condescend and make friends with gardeners and florists from all over the world, buying them drinks and becoming friends, and exploring the secrets of planting and irrigation. Therefore, he can always find the best and achieve the unusual, like the Shijia’s coral nets, widely collecting rare treasures. He is also diligent in his work, working from morning to night, not relying on servants. Therefore, the flowers are appropriately moist or dry, and the temperature is suitable, allowing each to fulfill its life force in time. The fertilization, thinning, and density are all handled with the utmost care, presenting their beauty to the guests, and thus achieving today's grand occasion. During the conversation, everyone clapped their hands for a hearty toast, like drinking with the "Book of Han". Alas, things gather where they are liked, and work is perfected through diligence. He recommended Yihe to do so in his book.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (329)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Cui Xiu Diligently Asks for Characters from the Teacher, and a Heroine Dines in a Brothel While Eloquently Discussing Military Affairs</p>
<p>Ye Haoran said with a smile, "What's so important about taking off your shoes? We're used to taking them off in Japan. Besides, their floors are wiped so clean, and the tatami mats are so soft. What's not to like?" A Su shook her head and said, "Chinese people are not used to it. Like us, with our big, flat feet, it already feels a little strange to walk on the floor in socks. And those young ladies with bound feet who pretend to have big feet can't even walk without their shoes. One day, there was a guest who was a student studying in Japan. He took me and Lao San (Third Sister) together. I was okay, but Lao San really complained." Long Ziyun said, "What did Lao San complain about?" A Su said, "Fourth Master, it's actually a funny story. Lao San had her feet bound from a young age, and they were bound to be pointed and neat. She suffered a lot for those feet. As the old saying goes, 'A pair of bound feet, a jar of tears.' When she first came to our place, she was only thirteen years old, and everyone praised her face as pleasing. Her feet were really small and well-shaped. Who knew that times would change, and bound feet would become unfashionable? So, in the past, women pretended to have small feet because their feet were big. Now, women pretend to have big feet because their feet are small. Lao San also bought those flat-bottomed, round-toed shoes. It's a pity that her feet are pointed, so she had to stuff countless amounts of cotton into the toes of the shoes. When people look at them, they seem like half-grown feet, but it's actually a trick. This guest, I don't know if he was being mischievous or what, didn't say anything at first. But when we got to the entrance of the Japanese establishment, he said we had to take off our shoes to go in. As soon as she took off her shoes, it was like the White Snake (Legend of the White Snake) was about to reveal her true form. Lin Lao San's face turned red, and she refused to go in. Later, I persuaded her with a lot of effort. Since we had come, we couldn't embarrass the host. It was too far to go back to Hongkou. She seemed very wronged. Fourth Master, actually, I don't think bound feet are a big deal." Long Ziyun sighed and said, "In this era of transition, there are many things being sacrificed. When it comes to women's feet, it's really a small matter." Ye Haoran said, "We didn't know that even though we're used to it in Japan, we didn't know how uncomfortable it is for Chinese women with bound feet to step on tatami mats without shoes. I have a fellow townsman named Wu, who is also studying in Japan. Isn't everyone knows that Jin Xiaobo, one of his four great beauties in Shanghai, is very close to him. When he arrived in Japan, Jin Xiaobo also went with him. The affection between them was naturally very sweet. There are many places with beautiful scenery in Japan, and it's so interesting to stroll hand in hand after class. However, Jin Xiaobo still couldn't get used to living there and had to return to China first. I heard that it was also because Jin Xiaobo's bound feet felt really uncomfortable stepping on the tatami mats (Japanese mats), so she went back first."</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Rush Sees Another Surge</h3>
<p>New High of Sixteen Taels and Three Mace. Yesterday's gold price surged extremely vigorously, showing an unstoppable and meteoric rise. It even exceeded 610 taels. However, the storm was turbulent, with twists and turns of two or three taels, making it difficult to handle. The total daily fluctuation amounted to five taels. The fluctuating prices caused the foreign exchange rate to be extremely strong, with the official exchange rate narrowing by one and a half notches. Dealers were all seeking supply from banks, and trading was lively. The market had mixed trading activities among various firms. In the morning session, demand exceeded supply, and firms like Taikangrun, Xiexu, Yuanheng, and Dadecheng had consistently strong buying interests. Taihengyuan, Shunli, Wanxing, and Wupin (Merchandise) were selling. Overseas silver markets continued their sharp decline because the United States resumed selling. As a result, gold prices soared by six or seven taels. Sellers seemed to be showing some weakness afterward because the exchange rate was particularly tight. The official exchange rate was narrowed, and bullish sentiment was strong on the trading floor. Short sellers were eager to enter the market. However, the concept of reaching a peak of a thousand zhang appeared repeatedly. The new high reached 616 taels and three mace. At noon, many parties tried to unload their positions, causing a sharp drop of two taels. In the afternoon session, sellers became more aggressive, resulting in a rapid retreat and a sharp drop of three or four taels, especially because the exchange rate seemed to ease from its tight state, suggesting a possible reaction. In the end, the price settled around 612 taels. However, major dealers still expected the price to fall this morning.</p>
<p>Opening With a Sharp Rise of Six Taels and Two Mace. This morning, the opening price of the January gold standard was 612 taels and seven mace, representing a sharp rise of six taels and two mace. (However, the spot market was chaotic. The initial bid was 12 taels, then dropped to a little over 10 taels, then rose to 13 or 14 taels, and finally settled at 11 or 12 taels. Trading varied.) This was because major dealers were lowering the silver price by 3/16 of a tael and the silver price was dropping by 6/8 of a cent. However, the buying interest of Taikangrun and Dadecheng was strong, pushing the price up to 13 taels and six or seven mace. Unexpectedly, Wupin, hedging their position, and Wanxing and Shunli leaned towards selling, causing the price to drop by more than two taels. However, British gold remained firm. January was purchased by Hua Bi (Belgian-Chinese Bank) at 162.5, and North Korea sold March at the same price. Even when the first order was announced at 11 taels and one or two mace, and the official exchange rate narrowed by 2.5 US dollars and 0.5 Japanese yen, adding 1.875 cents, it did not move, as the price had already been pushed up. At that time, it was 11 taels and three or four mace. Yuan Maoyong sold, and the domestic market stabilized. Banks mutually traded March US dollars at 37 yuan, and Datong (International Banking Corporation) entered January at 36 yuan and 812.5. The gold price then dropped again by six or seven cents to 10 taels and seven cents around 10 o'clock. Shortly after, Yudai, Fuxingyong, Yuancheng, Dadecheng, Taikangrun, and Yuanheng rushed to buy, immediately soaring to a cloud-piercing price, rising by more than four taels, with fluctuations of one tael in between. Wanxing and Shunli sold. By 11 o'clock, the HSBC official exchange rate suddenly narrowed again by 1.25 US dollars and 2.5 Japanese yen, adding another 875 cents, instantly rising to 15 taels. Bank exchange rate trading was also active. Taiwan sold March at 161.875, and Dehua sold April at the same price. Then, Mitsui bought March at 1875, further raising the gold price by one tael. At 11:30, a new record of 616 taels and three mace was suddenly discovered. At that time, Yongfeng and Yuanxingyong dragged in positions, while Yuan Maoyong, Yuancheng, and Wupin came to sell, causing a sharp drop of two taels, settling at only 14 taels and two or three mace. The market closed at 14 taels and four mace. Wupin raised the price by three cents. The initial quote was 652 taels and eight mace. Because the Japanese yen rate was increased by 1.875 cents, the discount was 41 or 12 taels. After changing to 657 taels, the Japanese yen rate increased again by 875 cents, the discount rose to 42 taels and then 41 taels. The afternoon market closed at 40 taels. The afternoon market saw a slight decline in buyers.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 15 taels and six mace. Because Fuchang and Yuanchengyong bought in, Yuan Maoyong, Xiexu, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuanchengyong, Taikangrun, Hengxingyuan, Juchang, and others tended to sell in droves. The exchange rate followed suit and declined. Three-month British gold was initially absorbed by Mitsui and others at 162.5. North Korea entered Dalian at 1 tael, 3 mace, 4 fen, and 7.5 li. Shortly after, Mitsui sold at the same price. Hua Bi and Sumitomo bought three-month US dollars at 36 yuan and 937.5, causing gold prices to plummet by four taels. At 2:30, it was 11 taels and a half. Then, due to Mitsui's purchase of February British gold at 161.875, and Xiexu, Zhifengyong, and others entering the market to buy, the price rose again by two taels. At 3:15, it was 14 taels. However, the exchange rate still showed a downward trend. Dongya sold January at 162.5, which was bought by Mitsui. Dadecheng entered the market and then sold Fuxingyong, Hongli, Hongxingyong, and others, leading to a sharp drop of more than two taels. At 3:30, it was 11 taels and two mace. At 4 o'clock, it was 12 taels and four mace, immediately retreating to 11 taels and two mace. People's hearts were unsettled, so the market situation was volatile. The market closed at 4:30 at 12 taels, a further increase of five taels and five mace compared to the previous day, and then fell back to 11 taels and six or seven fen. Wupin lowered the price by three cents. The maximum daily price was 16 taels and three mace, and the minimum price was 10 taels and seven cents, a fluctuation of 5 taels and 6 mace. The revealed price was lowered by 45 taels. The book price was 617 taels to 14 taels, only 17 taels to 15 taels. The early morning Wupin price was 12 taels, and the noon price was 14 taels and seven mace. The afternoon price was 15 taels and a half, and the closing price was 11 taels and seven mace.</p>
<p>Short Sellers All Covered Their Positions, With Varied Dealer Transactions. In the morning, Taikangrun, Xiexu, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Yudai, Fuxingyong, Hengxing, and Yongfeng all entered. Shunli, Wanxing, Hengyuan, Hongli, Hengyu, Wupin, and others all sold. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong and Fuchang entered. Shunli, Yuan Maoyong, Xiexu, Yudai, Taikangrun, Hongli, Juchang, and others sold. Dadecheng, Wanxing, and Yuancheng had mixed transactions. Retail traders entered and exited intermittently. However, short sellers generally covered their positions but were severely stimulated. Dalian traders sold a total of 3,600 to 3,700 bars and bought 1,600 to 1,700 bars. Guangdong traders had a small number and entered the market.</p>
<h3>Extreme Tension in the Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market continued to decline. The HSBC official exchange rate repeatedly narrowed twice, totaling one and a half notches. From the early morning, British gold narrowed by 0.25 US dollars, half a yuan for Indian exchange, 13 yuan for French francs, and 1.25 yuan for Japanese yen. Singapore exchange added 2.55 taels, Hong Kong reduced by 0.25, and Japanese yen rose by 1.875 cents. At 11 o'clock, the rate changed again.

Japanese yen increased again by 875 cents, totaling  taels, three mace, six fen, and 25; Hong Kong remained unchanged at 80 taels and 75. The internal banking market was also tight. From the morning, the rate was high because the gold market saw a high peak exceeding 615 taels. In the afternoon market, the rapid current retreated, sharply dropping four taels because the exchange rate eased. In the end, British gold decreased by 1.875, US dollars by 375, and the Japanese exchange rate rose by 1.25 compared to the day before. Market interest rates were unprecedented. Chinese and foreign merchants seeking money each were , but transactions were quite . British gold was purchased by over ten thousand pounds, and was sold by over ten thousand . Banks such as Mitsubishi, North Korea, Taiwan, and Dehua sold out. Hua Bi, Dongya Zhengjin, Mitsui, Sumitomo Korea and others still had strong buying. Also, Jewish merchants were making a furious attempt to cover short positions. US dollars, with thirty or forty yuan, were released by Fuchang and other gold merchants to gain gold standards and the banking market did not weaken. Citibank, Datong, Anda, Hua Bi, Sumitomo, and others were absorbing it. Each line was making millions of pounds. There were also millions of yen worth of large chain bank bills issued by banks such as Sumitomo Korea Mitsui Hua Bi and others largely holding the current month's bills. It is speculated the silver market may have another decline this morning.</p>

<h3>Silver Coin Market is Consistently Peaceful</h3>
<p>The peaceful situation in the money market is confirmed with the waves from previous years. However, calmness remains largely because the business is weak and the situation is reversed. Due to the current attitude, the year's close has not been possible to grow, and closing is relatively difficult.</p>
<p>Money market eases (foreign market). Early morning rates were 7 yuan, 2 fen, 4 li, and 5 hao, a little lower by half of one li than the early market rates from the previous day. However, the noon market rebounded by one hao and 2 half, totaling 7 yuan, 2 fen, 4 li, 6 hao, and 2. The end totals are negligibly higher by 1 hao and 2 and the situation is stable (silver market) Early morning rates at 7 fen and noon rates at 6 fen. There was a drop in bank rates at 5 fen but the original rates did not change. The easy flow of silver can be seen.</p>

<h3>Wide Angle Shows Repeated New Records</h3>
<p>Opening at Six Mace, Six Fen, Zero Hao, Seven Half Cash in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Copper Coin Market Decreased by 5500 Wen Again</p>
<p>The momentum is in full effect with the flood of auxiliary coins that cannot be stopped. The city is only increasing the price due to low sales to the Henan because of a lack of excess sales demand and low market demand and has no variation. Only Canton is seeing a meteoric rise with an opening in the morning market at six mace and six fen and a 6 mace, six fen, zero hao, and seven half cash in the afternoon. The end is seeing new repeated new records by growing 3 cent hao and one half, compared to the peak rate from the afternoon market from the previous day. Hence in past records this has never been witnessed. The rates for the day in the market are continually cutting the line short. Every yuan once had an exchange rate that was 12 jiao or more in its peak. Now the exchange is 11 jiao and not quite yet. Yesterday's market price was however about only at ten jiao, zero fen, nine li, and six hao or the combined exchange rate for ten jiao and the 220 - 230 text cash out transactions.

About 31000 were sold from the sale.</p>

The markets for the other bonds were empty. There weren't any big changes to the bond market because the condition was clear, but the buys seemed to be better than sells overall. Comparing to the other days, 96 was about 1 yuan, demobilization bonds was half a yuan, and the other various bonds were about two or three angle different. It is estimated the trades added to 15000. The amount traded for futures was about 3.4 million for the early markets and 3.1 million for the later markets. 6.54 million in total.</p>

<h3>The Thread, Flower, and Thread Market Is Trending Flat</h3>
<p>The Thread Market saw a price rise in the morning and flatness in the afternoon, but the true demand remained low and dull. Sales were more difficult due to the end of the Chinese New Year. Traders were feeling even more weary because of this. According to Japanese trade, there were around 20000 bales in the 16th and 20th range of Japanese thread so that the jewel market was gradually decreasing in price. It was observed that some manufacturers' attitudes were passive. In general, The market price would rise at first before the sales would pour out. The inventory was generally too big and the sales channel was generally locked. It would be difficult for the market to see a price rise.</p>
<p>It was difficult to progress with the sale. The prices for the sale in the former market opened up with the price of American cotton stabilizing the market, resulting in merchants buying, creating a tighter situation on the market. Every month grew in price around 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 cash. Traders sold in the noon and caused the markets to decrease in price and flatten out a little. 2, 3, 5, and 7 cash in decrease across the board. 17750 bales of transactions were recorded in total from the day. It was found that Changfeng sold 1600 bales, Rongxing sold 1050 bales, and Xincheng sold 1450 bales. The rest, 4, 5, 8, and 900 bales. Yiyu bought 2850 bales, Xiesheng bought 1200 bales, and Yichang bought 900 bales. The rest, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 900 bales. I have listed the closing price below:</p>

<p>Real demands remained low. The current thread sales remained flat. According to the bank's total number of buy transactions across the day, 805 total bales of sales were sold, 40 from within the same group, and the thread price increased by 2.5 cash per second. 120 packages were sold to Guangdong merchants, 50 to Jiangxi merchants, 50 to Hankou merchants, 160 to Shantou merchants, 200 to inland traders, 110 to Gaoyang merchants, 45 to Sichuan merchants, and 70 to mixed trading merchants.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Pushed By the Price of Sales</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending upward because of the rising gold prices which are relating to the trade. Merchants are inspired to increase their buys. Currently the transactions for raw cotton have stopped completely and merchants have no sales intent. The American and Indian markets are seeing a weakened trade. Part of the market continues to dump excess inventory from the bottom of Hankou. The market is starting to see an increase of cotton. However, Shanghai is more stable because merchants are buying. The help that the Ningbo are getting has not waned.</p>
<p>The Price For the Hankou market grew 300 cents. The former and existing markets were calm. The sales market became more strained as it related to the gold prices across all months around 2 to 3 plates and it was tightly estimated 39400 Dan. Origin sold about 45900 Dan, Yuande had 1200 dan, and Ruida and Yicheng had 1400. Gongtai purchased 2700 Dan, Tianchang had 3200 dan, and Yuchang had 3600 dan. The rest made 1 to 2000 Dan.

<h3>Private Estimates of U.S. Cotton</h3>
<p>New York, 4th: Fooks Bureau estimates this year's new cotton production at 14,194,000 bales, a decrease of 2,000 bales from the previous estimate. It also predicts the number of ginned bales to be 12,800,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market: Weak in the South, Stable in the North</h3>
<p>White Yuan Consistently Falling: Indica Rice All Showing a Steady Trend</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, about fifty boats of He Xia rice arrived. In the morning, continuing the momentum from the previous day, sales were active. Northern japonica rice briefly rose slightly during the opening auction, but sales quickly faded, and the market returned to flat. Currently, top-grade is scarce in the market, with the top overall price being 13 yuan and 8 jiao. Early indica rice remained stable with very flat store sales, maintaining the original price. Yang indica rice also initially increased slightly, but then softened due to sluggish sales. In the afternoon, the high opening price was 12 yuan and 1 jiao. Du Jian inventory is gradually increasing, and buying interest is weak, with no price increases or decreases. Wharf tips moved slightly in retail. The source is sparse, and the market is quite stable. Passing through channels, sales are dull and two jiao is lost. The market price is especially strong for top-quality goods at around 13 yuan and a half, with ordinary goods only at 13 yuan to 12 yuan and a half, a very weak situation. Yin yuan is unfavorable, and the appetite of the crane workshop is especially weak. Moreover, the goods cannot be left for long, so the market tends to soften. The market opened high at 11 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Hu Nan: Yesterday, various gangs arrived with twenty or thirty boats. Sales in this street turned dull. Changxi Machine Milled Japonica Rice: Prices fell as buying interest from towns and villages waned, and the market shortened by two jiao, opening high at 13 yuan and a half. Su Tong white japonica rice sales were unusually quiet, with sparse retail sales and a slight rise of half a jiao. The situation here is unusually difficult to sustain, so this newspaper reported yesterday that it is not easy to go up, which is indeed due to the circumstances. South Gang early indica and early rice river stocks are very thick, with slow digestion. Only a few scattered transactions. The market has fallen one or two jiao or so. Yang indica and Du indica, because the base price is still cheap, the overall market has no rise or fall. Change yuan and Yin yuan generally arrive with dull sales and fall by two jiao, and outside the top, Yin Hua opened at 11 yuan and 4 or 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Turns Around for the Better</h3>
<p>Actual Sales in Motion: Standard Flour Rises Sharply by Three Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of all months uniformly showed a rising trend, with foreign wheat quotations rising from two, three to six, seven jiao or so. The market sentiment, because the futures and spot markets have already become related, has abandoned the imagination. The environment outweighs the facts. Currently, factory stocks of spot goods are not piled up, so spot quotations have always been not cheap. Standard military ships cannot be had for less than two liang and two qian. For this reason, actual sales gangs from within and outside the port have been buying standard flour to prepare for future spot market collections. The sudden rise in the market is a trend of the facts, not speculative gains. As a result, the current month's price rose sharply by three fen and two and a half li compared to the previous day's closing price. January rose three fen and two and a half li, February rose three fen and seven li, March and April rose three fen, May rose one fen and seven li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Rebound Strongly</h3>
<p>Empty Positions Already Strong: Rebound Also Rapid</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of wheat futures in the morning and afternoon, the market for all months also saw a sharp rise. With good foreign wheat quotations, the futures flour market was also becoming increasingly tense. The flour and wheat situation has always had a linked relationship. Now that the sentiment is not as sluggish as before, the outside short sellers cannot help but feel especially panicked. Therefore, the earnestness of offsetting positions between the various markets is as enthusiastic as during the frantic selling. This is the rebound that should occur after the market has bottomed out. As a result, the current month's price rose sharply by nine fen compared to the previous day's closing price due to urgent short covering. January rose six fen, February rose seven fen, March and April rose six fen, and May rose seven fen. Spot wheat market is still quiet and there is no start of operations.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Swire Sugar Sells Briskly, Opening with 1,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegram: Cuban spot sugar price is 1.375, a decline of 0.03125 compared to the previous telegram. New York sugar futures December price is 1.32, up 0.03. The next year's March price is 1.40, up 0.02. May price is 1.48, up 0.03. September price is 1.61, also up 0.02. Java spot sugar price is still 7.875. January futures price is 7.875. February price is 8.00, each down 0.0125. The market outside the Exchange is even higher with foreign exchange. The market sentiment is increasingly firm, and buyers are quite active. The transaction price reached seven liang and nine qian. Moreover, the amount coming out of storage is sparse. Sellers are calling for seven liang and nine qian and a half. Although receivers are quiet, the market situation is quite brisk. Ground fine sand is seven liang, nine qian, seven and a half fen. No. 20 medium white sand is seven liang, eight qian. No. 6.9 and a half qian. No. 8 Dutch red is six liang, four qian and a half. No. 10 goods are six liang, six qian and a half. The market is also not weak. White sugar trading is more active. Z Mark is eight liang and five fen. TK Mark is eight liang. YR Mark is seven liang and nine qian and a half. YP Mark is eight liang and four qian. Meiji goods are eight liang and a half. YRO Mark is seven liang and four qian. Minghua goods are seven liang and four qian and a half. The market conditions all look firm. Plate ice flowers have a transaction price, still seven liang and one qian and a half. Swire sugar, January delivery, opened with B Mark at 500 bags at one yuan, six liang, five qian and a half. CW Mark is 500 bags at one yuan, six liang, and two qian, and four qian and a half. Both are new regulations with added tax, still feeling brisk. A certain firm needs 5,000 bags at the same price, still waiting for a Hong Kong reply to confirm.</p>
<h3>Pi Tou: Tianjin Gang Purchases Large Quantities of Fine Cloth</h3>
<p>Local factory cloth: Yesterday's situation was slightly better. After several days of decline, it aroused actual sales activities. Goods urgently needing silver padding have mostly been sold. Therefore, yesterday fine cloth and fine twill both rose five fen. Sales to Tianjin Gang were the most brisk, with transactions of two or three hundred pieces of fine cloth. Guangdong Gang's search for fine twill was also keen, with over a hundred pieces transported yesterday. There were also many transactions in this street and Ningbo. There was also a desire to buy up collapsed goods, so people's hearts were also good. Nine-pound coarse cloth is still lacking, with goods being sold as soon as they appear. Tianjin Gang's search for eleven-pound cloth was also keen. Coarse twill did not change much. Only white flannel gradually declined.</p>
<p>East and West Cloth: Rise and fall were mutually seen. Yesterday, black flower velvet and water wave velvet from Donghu goods fell again by two and a half li. Bald yuan fine broadcloth rose by two and a half li due to operations by Han Gang. Three Friends pattern sold out for two qian, eight fen and a half. Circus sold for two qian, eight fen and two and a half li. Zijin Mountain was two qian, nine fen and seven and a half li. Printed flannel was even more depressed, falling to one qian and seven or eight fen yesterday. Zhigong Ni (Zhigong wool) and Zhigong Duan (Zhigong satin) both rose uniformly. Three Friends pattern Zhigong Ni suddenly rose by one fen. First Merit Moganshan rose by two and a half li. Bottom half Zhigong Duan was completely out of stock because a large batch was purchased by Qingdao Gang in recent days. Hankou and Shashi Gangs were quite active with fine broadcloth. Over a hundred pieces were transported yesterday, with the Lake Heart Pavilion and Three Friends patterns being more popular.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Russian Firm Stops Dealing in Red and Green Tea</h3>
<p>The Russian Relief Association, which sells a very large amount of tea, has announced that it will formally cease operations by the end of this week. Although the inventory of Gongxi green tea and Qining tea from the two lakes, which are currently sold jointly by Russian firms, is not large, the impact on Chinese tea merchants is increasingly felt. However, at this time of expensive gold and cheap silver, Japanese and Indian teas are many times more expensive than Chinese tea. The current reason for the cessation of operations is actually due to financial relations. It should continue after the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Price Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's telegram: 26 liang and a half</p>
<p>Longkou vermicelli, previously due to sluggish sales, the price fell to a minimum of 25 liang and three qian (per bag). Now, because various firms here are purchasing from the local area, the trend has turned upward, gradually increasing. According to yesterday's telegram, it has risen to 26 liang and a half. The Shanghai market's price has also been called higher. Yesterday, inland southern specifications were sold on this street for 25 liang and a half, with a very stable trend.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Zhaohé Uprising Commemoration</h3>
<p>Municipal Party Headquarters Convened a Grand Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the 15th anniversary of the Zhaohé warship uprising. The Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters had previously notified various agencies, groups, and schools in the city to send four representatives to attend the meeting. Over four hundred representatives attended. Cai Hongtian, the chairman, reported on the facts of the Zhaohé warship uprising and the efforts that should be made. Tao Baichuan, Ye Huijun, and others then gave speeches with thorough and insightful arguments that moved the listeners. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Representatives from the Municipal Public Works Bureau, Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Women's Association, Guangzhao Girls' School, Shanghai Public School, Junyi Middle School, Danhua Elementary School, Sock Factory Labor Union, Cotton Weaving Factory Labor Union, Postal General Administration, New Drug Industry Association, and other district party headquarters, district branches, labor unions, schools, etc., as well as the entire student body of the Secretariat Association Training Institute, totaling over four hundred people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Fellow representatives, fellow comrades, today, December 5th, 1915, fifteen years ago, was the day that our party's martyr, Mr. Chen Qimei, under the guidance of the Premier, resisted Yuan Shikai's betrayal of the Republic and his attempt to restore the imperial system. Ever since the Premier relinquished the position of President to Yuan Shikai, Yuan not only did not devote himself to the Republic, but instead borrowed large sums from five countries, recruited soldiers, and purchased weapons to brutally slaughter the Kuomintang's henchmen, with spies everywhere in various provinces. All personnel associated with the Kuomintang could not feel safe day or night. His own dream of becoming emperor grew more intense every day. The Premier's youthful struggles and the sacrifices of so many martyrs had arduously created the new Republic of China, which had fallen into the hands of traitors and villains. How could the Premier and the comrades loyal to our party not gnash their teeth in order to rebuild the Republic's great achievement? Mr. Chen Qimei was the first to support the Premier, leading to the momentous and heroic uprising of the Zhaohé warship to punish the rebel Yuan on December 5th, 1915, in Shanghai. Initially, Mr. Chen sent Yang Hu and other comrades leading the Marine Corps to seize the Zhaohé warship stationed in Songhu with pistols and bombs, formally launching the uprising and clearly explaining the meaning of punishing Yuan to the officers and soldiers on the ship. Everyone was happy to revolt as revolutionaries. Comrades on shore also set out to occupy important institutions such as the telegraph and telephone bureaus and the police headquarters. Later, Mr. Chen heard the booming of the Zhaohé warship's cannons and knew that the uprising had begun, so he personally led the cadres Wu Zhongxin, Chiang Kai-shek, Ding Jingliang, and others to the Chinese-controlled area of the South City to direct the brave fight against the bandits. However, Yuan Shikai's large forces also arrived, and due to numerical inferiority and insufficient weaponry, they suffered a crushing defeat. Fellow comrades, when Mr. Chen Qimei launched the Zhaohé warship uprising, how could he not have known that the result would ultimately be failure? But revolutionaries should not be afraid of failure. Although the Zhaohé uprising failed, it stirred up the courage and determination to punish Yuan everywhere, so the success of the Yunnan uprising was deeply rooted in the Zhaohé uprising. Why are we so excited today as we remember the painstaking efforts of the martyrs who loved the Republic? Now, Yuan Shikai has long been thoroughly wicked and buried, but his poison has not yet been completely eliminated. How can the comrades who come after not feel ashamed and continue the revolutionary spirit of the Zhaohé uprising to eliminate all feudal forces that harm the Republic? Now, although the Yan-Feng warlords are preparing to go abroad, they still want to preserve their evil influence. To avoid the resurgence of warlords in the future, we should emulate the spirit of the martyrs of the Zhaohé uprising, urging the central government to completely eliminate all reactionary feudal forces, so that future construction projects can proceed smoothly without any obstacles, the completion of local autonomy, the promotion of political tutelage, and everything else will be resolved. The new China of the Three People's Principles, which the Premier painstakingly promoted and struggled for, can also be realized soon. Fellow comrades, we should make extra efforts from today onwards. Report completed. (The remaining speeches are omitted.) The slogans of the meeting have been seen in previous reports.</p>
<p>Yang Hu's Statement: On December 5th of the 19th year, Yang Hu published an article commemorating the launch of Zhaohé, saying, "The birth of the Republic of China is 19 years old. In these 19 years, the division of warlords internally and the oppression of foreign powers externally have all been sufficient to affect the health of the Republic. The most critical moment for the life and death of the Republic was Yuan Shikai's attempt to restore the imperial system. From the beginning of the Xinhai Revolution, Yuan possessed a heavy army and harbored ambitions. When his wings were fully grown and his conspiracy was set, he brazenly established a dynasty and claimed the throne, thinking of turning the Republic, which countless members of the party had exchanged for with heads and fresh blood, into the splendid territory of one family. At that time, the people feared his power, and the officials coveted his wealth, presenting memorials and calling themselves subjects, fearing to be late. Yuan looked around triumphantly, thinking that no one in the country could resist him. Unexpectedly, with a thunderclap, our party launched the Zhaohé uprising on December 5th of the 4th year, causing those who wanted to harm our Republic to turn around and harm themselves. The Zhaohé uprising was the central work of punishing Yuan. Mr. Qimei, with the permission of the Premier, exhausted his personal energy, relied on Mr. Kai-shek's plan, and drained the talents of the party to accomplish this. After a year of painstaking operation, the event was guided by the execution of Zheng thief Rucheng in Japan, followed by the response of the Yunnan and Guizhou uprisings. The clues seemed to be connected and not connected, but the Zhaohé uprising was the cause and effect. With this cause and effect, the value of the former became more evident, and the launch of the latter became faster. Thus, Yuan's heart grew cold, and Yuan's general situation disintegrated. Therefore, it can be said that the success of punishing Yuan was achieved by the launch of Zhaohé. The continuation of the Republic depends on the launch of Zhaohé. If there had been no Zhaohé uprising, it is not known whether the Republic would still exist today. The Zhaohé uprising rebuilt the Republic, and its contribution is great enough to be commemorated for ten thousand years, and the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs who participated in this battle and sacrificed their lives to achieve righteousness is especially worthy of being emulated forever. After the failure of the Second Revolution of the party, the plan in the north was unsuccessful, and the plan in Jiangsu and Zhejiang was unfavorable. There was no foothold in the country, and the comrades were mostly doubtful. Yuan's power was expanding, and the imperial system was about to be completed. Shanghai was a special place with serious Yuan's influence. The Zhaohé was a major warship of the enemy's navy. At this critical moment when the spirit of the party was unbroken, the martyrs, under the leadership of Mr. Ying, launched a fearless operation, wading through the water to seize the ship, raising their arms and shouting, firing cannons and fighting bravely, their energy shaking the mountains and rivers. Finally, they were isolated and exhausted, and they generously sacrificed their lives and did not yield. Many commentators consider it a major sacrifice in a failed undertaking and praised it, because only by its failure is there value, only by its sacrifice is there spirit. Success does not necessarily depend on me, and righteousness does not yield to others. The martyrs were determined to sacrifice themselves and take on the responsibility of curbing the fierce flames of the strong enemy, revitalizing the spirit of the party, and arousing the sympathy of the people of the whole country. As a result, the righteous wind spread, and the whole country rose up, and Yuan's fate was overturned. The spirit of the party was revived, and it gradually took control of the southwest to unify the whole country. Therefore, the Zhaohé uprising is not only related to the survival of the Republic, but also a key to the (revival) of the party. If there had been no Zhaohé uprising, it is not known whether the spirit of the party could be carried through to this day. At that time, I was ordered by Mr. Ying to take charge of the responsibility of supervising after the martyrs. The martyrs died, and Mr. Ying was also killed, and I unfortunately survived unexpectedly. I am truly unable to face Mr. Ying and the martyrs, but I have never dared to forget the hatred of the common enemy. Every year today, I feel even more distressed. I hope that the families of the martyrs will be treated with the same care and compensation as in the past. Every time I look at them, I feel sad. However, the self-sacrifice and righteousness of the martyrs is certainly not for the sake of posthumous compensation or for us to mourn, praise, or admire. We must inherit Mr. Ying's legacy and follow the footsteps of the martyrs, to advance, to sacrifice ourselves, to seek the eternal survival of the party and the nation, and to promote the glory of the nation. If not, what is the meaning of commemoration?"</p>
<p>Naval Party Headquarters Commemorates: The Naval Special Party Headquarters commemorated the 15th anniversary of the Zhaohé warship uprising yesterday. The Party Headquarters, together with the Naval Reorganization Office and the entire staff of the Training Fleet Headquarters, held a memorial ceremony at 10:00 AM in the department's auditorium. Chen Xunyong, the Standing Committee member, presided over the ceremony, and Ren Guangyu, the Standing Committee member, reported on the course of the uprising. They concluded by shouting slogans and adjourning the meeting.</p>

Over eighty people attended. Jiang Yiqiu presided over the meeting, performing the rituals. The chairman gave a report, followed by speeches from representatives of various agencies.

<h3>Business Community's Year-End Closing of Accounts</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Issues a Notice to Prepare Early</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to have the business community prepare early for the National Calendar year-end closing of accounts, issued a notice stating: "Regarding the matter of the National Calendar year-end closing of accounts this year, orders have been repeatedly given to comply.

<h3>Zhenru International Radio Station</h3>
<p>Grand Opening Ceremony Today</p>
<p>Wang Boqun Will Arrive in Shanghai This Morning to Preside</p>
<p>Wen Yuqing Hosted a Banquet for Chinese and Foreign Journalists Yesterday</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' International Communications Radio Station has been completely completed and is scheduled to hold its grand opening ceremony at 2:00 PM today in Zhenru. Minister of Communications Wang Boqun has sent invitations to all sectors of Chinese and foreign communities in the city to visit the station. Wen Yuqing, the director of the Radio Station Preparatory Office and the director of the Wireless Radio Administration, hosted a banquet for Chinese and foreign newspaper reporters yesterday afternoon. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Banquet Yesterday Afternoon: Yesterday afternoon, Wen Yuqing hosted a banquet for Chinese and foreign newspaper reporters at the Xinghualou on Fourth Avenue. Dozens of people attended, and Wen personally offered cordial hospitality, distributing to each reporter a simple report on the work of the Preparatory Office. During the banquet, he gave detailed explanations on the reporting situation in various countries and the equipment of the Sassoon Building's receiving and transmitting office in the concession. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until around 2:00 PM when they dispersed.</p>
<p>Minister Wang Arrives in Shanghai: Minister of Communications Wang Boqun is scheduled to take the night express train from Beijing at 7:00 AM this morning to Shanghai to preside over the grand opening ceremony. Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting, Songhu Garrison Commander Xiong Shihui, Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun, American Minister Johnson, Japanese Ambassador Shigemi Mamoru, consuls of various countries, and representatives of leaders of various organizations will all attend.</p>
<p>Special Train at the North Station: A special train will depart from the North Station to Zhenru at 1:15 PM today, offering free rides. It will return to Shanghai at 5:00 PM. The station has dispatched receptionists to the North Railway Station to take care of those going to Zhenru to visit. Visitors can first obtain a boarding pass from the receptionists. A grand tea party will be held at the Grand China Hotel at 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>Order of the Opening Ceremony: The order of the opening ceremony today is: 1. Meeting; 2. Bow three times to the national flag, the party flag, and the Premier's portrait; 3. Chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will; 4. Play music; 5. Conduct the unveiling ceremony; 6. Chairman reports on the preparation and establishment process; 7. Central representative gives a speech; 8. National Government representative gives a speech; 9. Guests give speeches; 10. Chairman responds; 11. Play music; 12. Photography; 13. Tea and snacks; 14. Adjourn the meeting.</p>
<p>Progress of Work: The station's preparatory office was established in October of the 17th year of the Republic of China, designed and managed by the Construction Committee. It was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications in August of the 18th year and actively carried out construction work. By the end of September of the 19th year, a total of 388,224 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen had been spent. However, all expenses incurred by the Construction Committee prior to this are not included.</p>
<p>Management Procedures: The main radio station has a branch station in Fenglin Bridge and a receiving and transmitting office in the Sassoon Building on Renji Road in the Public Concession. The management rights of the station will be under the jurisdiction of the Wireless Radio Bureau. Daily reporting will be done in the central receiving and transmitting room of the Sassoon Building, without having to go through Zhenru. The procedures are very simple.</p>
<p>Shuangqiao Contract: When reporters inquired about the relationship of the station with Japan and how the negotiations with Japan would be handled, it was said that Japan was using the Shuangqiao Radio Station contract signed during the Duan Qirui era as an excuse. This clause of the treaty was a loss of sovereignty and humiliation and could not be recognized. The Ministry of Communications can ignore it. It was also said that our country's military power during the warlord era had long been completely lost, and the United States and the United Kingdom also had wireless radio contract arrangements. At that time, the conditions stipulated by the United Kingdom were the most stringent, even stipulating that all of our country's future wireless radio materials must be purchased from that country. Now our country also does not recognize this, and the other party also knows that this condition is not in line with the trend and no longer insists on it. Therefore, Japan's request will naturally not be recognized.</p>
<h3>This City Levies Winter Tax</h3>
<p>Levy Starts on the 17th of this Month</p>
<p>Deadline is Two Months to Complete Payment</p>

In addition, all surcharges and surtaxes collected with the municipal expenses will still be collected according to the old regulations. These will be listed separately in the grain slip. From the date of levy, there is a two-month deadline to complete payment. Overdue payments will be charged an additional 20%. If the deadline is extended for another two months and payment is still not completed, an additional 10% will be charged as a penalty. This is to show the penalty for delays.

It is difficult to predict when Xiong will return to Shanghai. At the very least, it will be after the bandits and communists in Jiangxi Province have been completely suppressed.</p>

<h3>Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Returns to Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Japanese Communications Committee Comes Together</p>
<p>No Significant Results in Negotiations on Various Cases</p>
<p>Japanese Chargé d'Affaires to China, Shigemitsu Aoi, went to Beijing one day to negotiate various Sino-Japanese cases. He met with Foreign Minister Wang and others several times, but there were no significant results in the negotiations on various cases. Regarding the note on the recovery of the Japanese Concession in Hankou, the Japanese government's reply has also been forwarded to the Japanese Embassy. The office received a telegram from Mr. Shigemitsu from Beijing yesterday, stating that he will return to Shanghai from Beijing today (the 6th), but he intends to go to Beijing again next week to continue negotiations. In addition, Mr. Yoshino, the Japanese expert committee member who accompanied Mr. Shigemitsu directly to Beijing to negotiate Sino-Japanese telecommunications issues, held several meetings, but the Japanese side stubbornly adhered to its own views and was unwilling to concede China's sovereignty over sea lines, resulting in no progress. Therefore, he has also decided to return to Shanghai at the same time today.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Pays Attention to the Pacification of Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Meeting Scheduled for the 13th to Discuss</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce believes that since the National Government has specially appointed Zhang Zhijiang as the Pacification Commissioner of Jiangsu Province, all follow-up measures after the suppression of bandits should be planned in advance by all Jiangsu people. The spirit of cooperation between the government and the people should be used to seek the relief of the people. Fellow villagers from Jiangsu Province, currently stationed in Jingjiang, have proposed concrete plans, such as establishing farmers' banks to lend money to the people and raising money to purchase seeds for distribution. The Chamber believes that the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce has the closest relationship with the security of Jiangsu Province and has decided to convene a meeting of all executive committee members at 4:00 PM on the 13th of this month to discuss the matter in detail.</p>

<h3>Eurasia Aviation Actively Preparing</h3>
<p>No Problem Passing Through the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Shi Mide Goes to Peiping Again</p>
<p>Since the signing of the Sino-German aviation agreement, Eurasia Aviation has been actively preparing. However, there were some objections from the Soviet Union regarding the passage of Sino-German airplanes through the Soviet Union. It is now reported that the representative of the German Lufthansa Company has reached an understanding with the Soviet government, and there are no more problems. Shi Mide, the representative of Lufthansa in China, went from Shanghai to Peiping and then to the Harbin area to inspect and prepare for the construction of airplane fields. It is reported that he returned to Shanghai from Peiping on the 1st to visit Chinese consultant Liu Shifang and German consultant Fogel to discuss everything. He also went to Beijing to meet with Transportation Minister Shi Yiqun. He returned to Shanghai yesterday and set off again for Peiping to prepare. Lufthansa's airplanes are expected to be shipped to Shanghai in early spring next year for trial flights.</p>

<h3>Various Industries' Regulation Protection Associations Continue to Strive for Industry Regulations</h3>
<p>Congratulatory Telegram to Minister of Industries Requesting Approval</p>
<p>Another Telegram to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Requesting Immediate Compliance</p>
<p>The Regulation Protection Committee of various industries' trade associations in various cities sent two important telegrams yesterday. They are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram congratulating Minister Kong: Respectfully to Minister Kong of the Nanjing Ministry of Industries: It is a great pleasure to know that you have been honorably appointed as Minister of Industries. From now on, may your talent be fully developed, and may agriculture, industry, and commerce be accurately coordinated. Developing industry and commerce is not difficult to surpass Europe and the United States. Industry regulations are like lips and teeth to industry and commerce. To develop industry and commerce, we must start by reorganizing industry regulations. Since the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce rejected the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce's industry regulations, the public has been in a state of shock. We hope that you will approve them quickly after taking office to comfort our hopes. Respectfully, the Regulation Protection Committee of various industries' trade associations in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce: Respectfully to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the Nanjing National Government: The industry regulations of the trade associations in Shanghai, which have been approved for recordation, should be regarded as special rules for the industry by the government. Whether or not they have joined the association, all businesses must abide by them. The case has been passed by the National Industry and Commerce Conference, and representatives have been sent to your ministry to request immediate implementation. However, no approval has been received to this day, which is deeply frightening. The industry representatives' congresses that have been held have all regarded industry regulations as the key to the rise and fall of commerce. If we do not order everyone to abide by the regulations, how can commerce have a chance to survive? The public is extremely anxious. It has been unanimously decided to send another telegram to your ministry requesting immediate implementation in order to stabilize commerce and maintain commercial transport. The association was established on October 27th at the first industry representatives' congress. It has been decided to temporarily borrow the third floor of the City Chamber of Commerce as an office. Respectfully, the Regulation Protection Committee of various industries' trade associations in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese United Association Pleads for Third Time to Abolish Provisional Passport Law</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese United Association has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from overseas Chinese organizations in British, French, and Dutch territories, requesting it to continue to advocate for the abolition of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Provisional Passport Law. Therefore, it sent another telegram to the foreign affairs authorities yesterday, which read: To the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The association previously received a proposal from staff member Lin Youren and urging from numerous overseas Chinese organizations to request the abolition of the Provisional Passport Law in telegrams on July 24th and August 31st of this year. The Executive Yuan approved that your ministry should quickly discuss the passport law and submit it to the Legislative Yuan for review. Your ministry also sent an official letter stating that the Provisional Passport Law is temporary in nature and that the ministry is consulting various parties to formulate a new passport law, which will be submitted to the National Government for referral to the Legislative Yuan for discussion once it is drafted. After reporting the progress of the revision, we were told that the overseas community had been waiting for several months without any progress. In fact, the situation has become worse. The guarantees have become more demanding, and the passport fees have increased. The price per passport has risen to 21 yuan in Xiamen and 26 yuan in Hong Kong. The situation in Shantou is even more expensive. Poor people going abroad on ships are all resentful. Foreign consulates treat issuing passports as a source of profit and repeatedly issue announcements to intimidate overseas Chinese, one saying (Ministry of Foreign Affairs order, strict handling) and another saying (do not neglect, lest it cause inconvenience) (recorded from the Surabaya consulate announcement). This kind of language is detrimental to the country and the party. If your ministry is responsible for this, then the responsibility lies with you. The association deeply believes that the overseas Chinese have followed the Premier for ten years, not hesitating to destroy their homes in times of trouble, and not hesitating to pay passport fees after success. However, we believe that we must take the right path and even if it is a huge amount, it is not too much. However, if it goes against the will of the people, even a small amount will cause resentment. Your ministry's Provisional Passport Law charges excessive fees and is full of flaws. The association has gathered public opinion and has explained it in detail in a telegram (ten reasons why it is unacceptable).</p>
<p>If your ministry believes that it is not appropriate, it should be refuted one by one. Instead, you express sympathy on the one hand and strictly enforce extortion on the other hand, causing overseas Chinese chambers of commerce in British and French territories to send letters and telegrams in protest, either likening it to a knife or a tyrannical example. The association loves the party and the country and is unwilling to sit idly by and watch the party and country's policy of protecting overseas Chinese be destroyed by your ministry's Provisional Passport Law. We cannot help but offer our sincere advice again. If you approve the abolition, it will be a blessing. If you want to fulfill your promise to revise it, please set a date and inform us of the revision outline in advance so that we can study it and contribute our humble opinions. The association would rather take precautions before things happen than to suffer the consequences later. We hope that your ministry will grant our request. Respectfully, the Overseas Chinese United Association.</p>
<h3>South Seas Inspection Team Requests the Signing of a Sino-French Equal and Reciprocal Trade Treaty</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Union received a letter from the South Seas Islands Inspection Team in Saigon, stating that because the import tax on Chinese national products is high in that area, it has sent telegrams to the foreign and industrial ministries, which read: Respectfully to Ministers Tu and Kong of the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Industry and Commerce: The high import tax on Chinese national products in Annam hinders sales. The overseas Chinese community hopes for a Sino-French equal and reciprocal trade treaty to be signed quickly to facilitate progress.</p>
<p>This is a special report to inform all factories.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Overseas Chinese Industrial Survey Team</h3>
<p>For the sake of developing the motherland's industry, overseas Chinese have previously organized an industrial survey team to return to the country and conduct surveys of various industries. As reported in previous newspapers, the war was raging at that time, and it was difficult for the survey personnel to conduct surveys in various places. The personnel in the survey team are all wealthy overseas businessmen, each with their own business interests, and they cannot stay in the mainland for long. They have returned to the south one after another. Recently, the team believes that the domestic war has ended, and the whole country is working hard to develop domestic industry. Before all the personnel of the team have returned to the country, Mo Keming and others have been entrusted to take charge of all affairs. It is said that Mr. Mo has been actively carrying out his duties since taking over and has closed the office previously located on Route Hua in the French Concession and will move it to a more convenient location in the British Concession soon. The development of domestic industry is very important. Although overseas Chinese are enthusiastic about investing, we hope that the authorities and people from all walks of life will provide guidance and cooperation in all matters.</p>
<h3>Rice Dealers' Trade Association Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The inaugural meeting of the Shanghai Rice Dealers' Trade Association was held at 3:00 PM yesterday at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium at Tianhou Palace Bridge. More than 500 people attended. Lu Wenshao, Zhang Nianxuan, Huang Gengbo, Xu Jingzhi, and Shi Hongxun were elected as chairmen, and Xiao Shan served as the recorder. After the ceremony, Chairman Lu Wenshao of the presidium gave a report, stating that the association was ordered by the former Commercial Rectification Association in the spring of the 19th year of the Republic of China to merge the Shanghai Gongyitang Rice Industry Association, the Shanghai Special City Rice Industry Merchants' Association, and the Wusong Rice Grain Association, whose business operations were the same, in accordance with the laws and regulations promulgated by the National Government and reorganize them into the Rice Dealers' Trade Association. The three organizations separately elected rectification committee members to first organize the Rice Dealers' Trade Association Rectification Committee to start rectification. On April 19th of the third year, the three organizations separately transferred various documents and real estate to the Rectification Committee. After receiving the documents, the Rectification Committee reported to the City Social Affairs Bureau, the Commercial Rectification Association, etc. for filing. At the same time, the original membership list of the three organizations was reorganized. The association could have been established on time, but it was ordered by the City Social Affairs Bureau to handle the registration of all rice dealers in the city and to investigate and report on the arrival and sale of rice. The association first issued temporary registration certificates to each. Then, the labor union proposed amendments to the treatment conditions, which were resolved and mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau. It took several months to conclude the labor-capital contract. During the summer and autumn, when the source of rice was scarce and prices soared, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the association to assist in managing the fair price of rice and established a branch office in Zhabei to handle matters in accordance with the order, such as the public measures for rice boats in the river. The work was tedious. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau issued a notice restricting rice prices and ordering the association to assist in the distribution of fair price rice at more than a dozen distribution points in the city and countryside. Wu Song's merger procedures only involved listing the documents and transferring them, but the actual consolidation was delayed. After repeated consultations and written correspondence, personnel were sent to Song to negotiate, but there were no results. Finally, the merger was rejected on the grounds that the original members did not want to join. By the time the fair price and other matters were concluded, several months had passed, and the merger of Wu Song had not been completed, which was the most difficult to handle. Now that the deadline for the establishment of the trade association is approaching, and the Rectification Committee has completed all the preparations for the congress, it cannot delay the progress of the association due to the delay in Wu Song's merger. In addition to submitting this matter to the City Chamber of Commerce for review and handling, it has been decided to convene a congress of trade representatives today to announce the formal establishment and elect the official executive committee. Here is a summary of the association's merger and past work, and we ask the representatives of all superior levels to provide instructions and guidance. Then, Wang Lide, a representative of the city party headquarters, gave instructions. The articles of association were then passed. Chairman Lu Wenshao of the presidium read the twenty-nine articles of association one by one and submitted them for public resolution. As for the membership fee issue in Articles 22 and 25, the original fees were divided into three types: Type A, those with daily rice sales of 30 dan or more, would pay a monthly fee of 3 yuan; Type B, those with daily rice sales of 15 dan or more but less than 30 dan, would pay a monthly fee of 2 yuan; and Type C, those with daily rice sales of less than 15 dan, would pay a monthly fee of 1 yuan. Later, member Wang Shenkang proposed to change it to half a yuan for monthly rice sales of less than 10 dan, one yuan for more than 10 dan, and two yuan for more than 20 dan, with the rest calculated accordingly. There were no other objections, and all were passed. Then, the election was held. Ma Ren, Qu Zhenhua, Xu Hongjia, and Wang Ziyuan were appointed as inspectors. There were as many as 415 ballots in total. The election of the various committee members was scheduled to be held. Due to lack of time, Chairman Lu Wenshao of the presidium spoke, stating that the ballot counting and election would continue at 10:00 AM tomorrow (today) at the Jiagutang office on Nan City's Zhongfeng Street. The meeting was then adjourned for a photo session, and it was already past 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Sixth Board Meeting of the Industrial and Commercial Management Association</h3>
<p>The China Industrial and Commercial Management Association held its sixth board meeting at the Lianhua General Association the other day. Directors Liu Hongsheng, Xu Ji, Pan Xulun, Lu Feibohong, Shou Jingwei, Qian Chengxu, and others attended and jointly discussed the association's work plan and reviewed the budget book ordered by the ministry. It was decided to organize a publishing committee to take charge of the matter. Wang Yunwu, Lu Feibohong, and Shou Jingwei were elected as the preparatory members of the publishing committee. The three directors will jointly discuss the invitation of special writers and the selection and translation of books.</p>
<h3>County Magistrate Yan Concurrently Serves as Public Security Bureau Chief Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shanghai County Magistrate Yan Shenyu was ordered to concurrently serve as the Public Security Bureau Chief and is scheduled to take office on the 5th of this month. At 9:00 AM yesterday, County Magistrate Yan specially sent four commissioners to the bureau. Former Bureau Chief Shen transferred the funds, firearms, clothing, files, etc. handled during his tenure after they were inventoried and checked. Mr. Shen then resigned. Mr. Yan then took over the seal of office and appointed Yu Fen, the chief of the second section of the county government, to concurrently serve as the chief of the first section of the bureau. Chen Guozhen was appointed as the chief of the second section, and Wei Bulin and Shi Zhaolan were appointed as staff members. The position of chief inspector will be temporarily filled by Zhang, a patrol officer of the bureau. In addition to submitting a report for filing and sending a separate notification, a notice was also issued to inform the people of the county.</p>
<h3>Baoshan County County Government Meeting</h3>
<p>Baoshan County Magistrate Qiu Mingji convened a special county government meeting at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, attended by the directors of the public security, finance, and construction bureaus and the section chiefs of the county government. Chairman Qiu served as the chairman, and Zhang Ruyu served as the recorder. The results of the discussion were as follows: ㈠ The Public School jointly operated by the county government and various bureaus has now ended. How should the bonuses and prizes purchased and awarded to each student as resolved at the 34th county government meeting be distributed? (Resolution) The academic scores of each student should be divided into four levels (A, B, C, and D) if they are 60 points or higher (90 points or higher is A, 80 points or higher is B, 70 points or higher is C, and 60 points or higher is D). Students who have not missed a class from the start of school to graduation will be given an additional award by the county magistrate. The amount of the special prize will vary. Students who score below 60 points will be given a failing certificate, and the prizes will not be awarded. ㈢ It is proposed that the next session of the Public School should start at what time? (Resolution) It will continue to be held from January 1st, 1920. ㈣ Director Qian of the Construction Bureau proposed that the third district office's letter transferring the request of district resident Huang Guixi to rebuild the original road along the south bank of the Di River at the Baitan Bridge and pave it with bricks and remove the trees that obstruct the route be approved. It was found that there is no market and no need for wide streets and buildings at that location. The trees in the road can be used for their shade to block the hot sun. The district resident's request to build a road may be granted to slightly fill in the collapsed areas of the riverbank. The trees should not be removed, and the road surface is already wide. Should he be ordered to comply with the announcement previously issued by the county government? Please decide. (Resolution) He should still comply with the method of the announcement previously issued by the county government.</p>
<h3>County Rectification Committee Notifies Various Organizations to Quickly Form Cooperatives</h3>
<p>The Training Department of the Shanghai County Rectification Committee, in view of the importance of cooperative undertakings, has formulated steps to notify various organizations to earnestly promote the cause so that they can organize and establish cooperatives as soon as possible. The original text is extracted as follows: It is found that cooperative undertakings are the fundamental way to improve people's lives and improve economic organization. Since our party adopted cooperative undertakings as one of the seven movements and actively promoted them, people of insight in various places have been able to automatically organize cooperatives to seek increased production and improved living standards. However, the majority of the people still have no understanding of cooperative undertakings, and some who have understanding do not know how to use them. In view of this, the department specially notifies the party departments in various districts and various people's organizations to actively promote cooperative undertakings in accordance with the simple steps of organizing cooperatives and to report the promotion situation on a monthly basis. This is a special notice.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Records of Shipping Accidents</h3>
<p>German Ship Woge Sinks</p>
<p>The German ship Hattie Weat ran aground on a reef in heavy fog off Dongsha Island and sank immediately. The shipowner sent a radio call for help, and the American military ship there received it and sailed to help. Fifteen crew members, including the shipowner, have been rescued and are now being sent to Hong Kong. As for the hull and cargo, they have sunk due to excessive ruptures, resulting in huge losses.</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Collides in Yantai</p>
<p>The Japanese ship Fukuju Maru was transporting goods from Dalian to Shanghai when it collided with the Dafuku Maru, a Japanese fishing boat that had invaded northern China's fishing grounds, four miles outside the port of Yantai, off Tiger Beach. The captain and crew were completely lost at sea. Fortunately, there were two Chinese cargo ships nearby that rescued the Japanese who had fallen into the sea.</p>
<h3>An Event of A Navigation Ship Attacked by Bandits Occurred in the Upper Yangtze River.</h3>
<p>Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Troops are Transported to Suppress</p>
<p>Bandits appear in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces are being suppressed, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is personally supervising the suppression. During this period of low water, ships sailing are more likely to be attacked by bandits. The Taikoo Company's upper Yangtze River ship was attacked and ran aground, resulting in heavy losses. What was heard is urgently recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Street Fixed Encounter with Bandits and Ran Aground</p>
<p>After the Sichuan River opened to navigation, large ships in the upper reaches stopped sailing to Shanghai. Taikoo's Wantong and other ships have stopped sailing, and the Yichang route has been reassigned to the Street Fixed, which has a very shallow draft. This time, the Street Fixed was carrying a large batch of yarn and cloth from Hankou and Yichang to Chongqing, Sichuan, when it was attacked by bandits downstream of Kuiguan. To avoid the gunfire, the captain ordered the driver to quickly steer outwards to avoid the impact of the bullets. However, the river water had receded greatly, and the river channel in that area was only five or six feet deep. The ship was already difficult to navigate, but when it veered outwards, it ran aground on a sandbar and could not move. Furthermore, it was heavily loaded and became trapped. After the ship ran aground, the bandits warned the captain to automatically throw the cargo into the river so that they could loot it. If he resisted, they would use the most drastic measures and set a deadline. The captain had no choice but to sacrifice the cargo in pain, resulting in huge losses. Fortunately, a Japanese warship arrived after the accident, and the captain raised a distress flag for help. The bandits then fled. Later, the Japanese warship telegraphed Hankou, and the Taikoo branch sent a ship to the scene of the accident to tow the Street Fixed to safety. It is said that the losses amounted to 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Xiushan Grounded Midway</p>
<p>A crew member of a Yangtze River ship that arrived in Shanghai from Yichang yesterday told reporters that bandits were still harming merchant ships in the Chenglingji area above Hankou. When the ship was launched in Hankou, it was heard that Taikoo's Xiang-E route Xiushan ship was sailing from Hankou to Changsha when it was attacked by bandits at Chenglingji. The ship ran aground to avoid the gunfire. A tugboat has been sent to rescue it.</p>
<p>Emei Was Also Shelled</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Chongqing ship Emei arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Yichang. The ship was shelled by bandits when it was traveling in the Jinzhou area, but fortunately it was not hit, so there were no losses. The ship is now equipped with an escort of soldiers from the Central Government.</p>
<p>Troops are being transported to suppress the bandits. Yangluo, which is sixty miles downstream of Hankou, is where the bandits are entrenched. The central government has dispatched two Yangtze River ships, Sanbei and others, carrying more than 4,000 soldiers to suppress the bandits and secure the route.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Establish Datong Marine Transportation Company</h3>
<p>Compete with Foreign Ocean and Coastal Transportation Ships</p>
<p>The Japanese company Yamashita Company and Kobe Japanese shipping circles have raised 500,000 yen to organize a transportation company in Shanghai and have established an office at 56 Sichuan Road. The company is called the Japanese Datong Marine Transportation Company. Its business will first focus on overseas cargo transportation. It has prepared one 8,000-ton ship and one 10,000-ton ship, named Daan and Dawen respectively. It has already transported 140,000 bags of wheat from the United States and Australia to Shanghai. The routes of each ship are not fixed and can be used to transport goods to any destination. At the same time, it plans to build a large number of tugboats to operate cargo lighterage services in Shanghai and various ports along the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Planning to Establish a Unified Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>To Be Reorganized from Flour and Cigarette Tax Office</p>
<p>The National Cigarette Unified Tax Office was previously ordered to be reorganized into the Flour and Cigarette Unified Tax Office, with Xie Qi as the director. Xie has been in office for several days. It is now heard that the Ministry of Finance has issued another order to expand and reorganize the office into a Unified Tax Bureau. The taxes it manages will not be limited to the unified taxes on flour and cigarettes. It will soon be organizing unified taxes on matches and cement, which will all be handled by the bureau. It is also heard that the office is currently preparing for the reorganization.</p>
<h3>Snowflakes of Appeals for Henan Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The China Relief Society has received numerous telegrams in recent days from Zhang Fang, Chairman of the Henan Province Relief Committee. These telegrams include appeals for relief for Luoning County, Shancheng County, Luyi County, Sizhou County, and Chixian County. The telegrams all state that due to consecutive years of drought, the people are struggling to survive, and bandits are rising up like silkworms, engaging in extortion, looting, and arson. During the national army's campaign to suppress the rebellion this summer and autumn, several counties fell into the hands of bandits. After the bandits left and the soldiers arrived, the people were not only robbed of their property by the bandits but also had to provide funds and food for the stationed troops, as well as donate discounted prices for shoes and socks, and supply vehicles arbitrarily conscripted for transporting goods. This has resulted in rubble-filled streets and grass covering the land, with households cut off from cooking smoke. People have died, been injured, or fled, accounting for nearly 40-50% of the population. Those who were once well-off have become poor, and the poor have become beggars, their cries of hunger and cold unbearable to hear. If relief is not provided urgently, the species will become extinct. Furthermore, telegrams from the county party headquarters are even more urgent.</p>
<p>After receiving these telegrams, the Society realized that it is currently managing disaster relief in Shaanxi, Northwest Beiping, Ning, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, and its expenses are already considerable. The most urgent cases have been dealt with by incurring debt. The Society deeply understands the pain and immense suffering in Henan, but due to financial constraints, it can only offer heartfelt sympathy. They hope that those with charitable hearts will look towards the Central Plains and provide practical assistance.</p>
<h3>Yuanyuan Company's New Arrival of Large Batch of Fuzhou Records</h3>
<p>Yuanyuan Gramophone Company at 554 Sima Road offers gramophones and records at lower prices than any other store due to reduced overhead. Recently, a large batch of Gaoting Fuzhou records has arrived, exclusively sold by the company. Among them, pieces such as "Purple Jade Hairpin" are considered the best in the Fuzhou community and are extremely clear in sound. People of the Shanghai Fujian community are rushing to purchase them.</p>

<p>Kneeling and Weeping, She Agrees to the Marriage Proposal</p>
<p>Yang Xuejiu's Reply to Relatives and Friends at Home and Abroad Reads:</p>
<p>"This time, Xuejiu returned to China from overseas and suddenly encountered a marital change, causing immense pain to both body and mind. The various slanderous and baseless reports in the newspapers have been relentless. Initially, I intended to ignore them, but I fear that if the matter is not made public, it will only lead to more speculation. Furthermore, letters and telegrams from relatives and friends at home and abroad have been pouring in, inquiring about the details. Previously, I was unable to respond due to illness, and I also struggled to express my inner feelings comprehensively. Now that my illness has slightly improved, and a reporter from the newspaper has also inquired about the facts, I will explain the entire marriage process in detail so that it can be published in the newspapers and inform my relatives and friends at home and abroad, as well as gentlemen and ladies.</p>
<p>I have known Xueyang for eight years. In the summer of the 12th year of the Republic, the Education Improvement Society held its annual meeting at Tsinghua School in Beiping. I followed my late father north to participate in the artistic group of the society, and Xueyang was also a member of the group, so we got to know each other. In the summer of the 13th year, due to the school's financial difficulties, I and my elder sister Xueqiong went north again to hold a personal exhibition of Chinese paintings at Central Park, using the proceeds from the sale of paintings to fund the school. Xueyang had a passion for books and paintings and often came to the meeting. He also knew that my late father was a friend of Chen Shizeng (corrected from the previous report's Chen Shizhen), so I introduced them to each other as fellow painters. Shortly after, I received a telegram about my late father's illness and immediately set off home. One month later, my late father passed away. Overcome with grief, I pledged not to marry and to continue my father's work. That autumn, Xueyang's elder brother, Yu Baoyuan, and his sister, Lady Gong, came to propose marriage on his behalf. Their intentions were extremely sincere and earnest, but I had already made my pledge, so I immediately and sternly rejected them. Xueyang suffered a setback from this blow, and the pain of unrequited love was expressed in his letters.</p>
<p>The name 'Xueyang' was thus chosen as his alias, taken from the poem in the Book of Songs: 'When I went forth, the willows were weeping; now I come back, the snow falls heavily. My heart is sad.' I wrote to him to console him as a friend and to quell his infatuation. At that time, the Yu and Zhang families were deeply concerned about the family lineage, and the two elders, nearing their twilight years, were both saddened by their unfulfilled wish to see him married. Therefore, Xueyang could not remain unmarried because of me. They repeatedly urged and advised him to marry someone else to comfort his parents, even threatening to sever ties. Thus, Xueyang, under duress, became engaged to his classmate, Miss You Yahao. I was overjoyed when the news arrived, as I could finally be free from any encumbrances. In July of the 14th year, Xueyang went to America to study abroad. He visited me once or twice when passing through Shanghai. Before leaving, he came to the riverbank to bid farewell as a friend. He also wrote to me from America from time to time. I was busy with school matters and feared that it would cause trouble when he returned to China in the future, so I did not respond frequently. At the end of the 16th year, Xueyang returned home due to his father's illness and took a position as a chemical engineer at the Wuzhou Gubenzao Soap Factory. As we were in the same place,</p>
<p>we visited more often. He often expressed deep melancholy when talking about his future, saying that the You family frequently urged him to set a wedding date and that his elderly father especially wanted his son to marry early, but he did not want to. His words hinted at his desire to break off the engagement. Knowing his feelings, I sternly rebuked him, swearing that I would never see him again if he did not marry. Afterwards, I avoided him whenever he came to school. I also put my heart into my work. In the autumn of the 17th year, Xueyang's father became seriously ill, and Xueyang got married. The night before the wedding, he came to say goodbye, and his words were filled with sadness, but I felt comforted. Shortly after the wedding, Xueyang's father passed away. On the rare occasions when we met, he revealed an unhappy expression, depressed and unhappy, even weeping. Although I knew his feelings, I pretended not to know and tried to comfort him. Later, when he came to visit, I insisted that he bring Miss You along, hoping to avoid misunderstandings and also to distance myself. However, Miss You never came to see me, which displeased me. Therefore, I was always uneasy when Xueyang came to visit, and I eventually asked him to leave. However, Xueyang did not mind at all and still looked at me frequently. His infatuation was such that I was at a loss for how to deal with it. Last autumn, I fell ill with a stomach ailment and was bedridden for a month. Xueyang visited me every day, and his sincere and earnest feelings made me feel both grateful and fearful. Therefore, whenever I saw him coming, I treated him with harsh words and cold eyes, hoping to extinguish his infatuation. However, Xueyang still did not change his infatuated attitude. Later, as my illness gradually improved, he fell ill. At that time, the school was preparing for meetings, and I had no time to visit him. Therefore, I wrote a letter to Dr. Wang Qizhang, entrusting him to sell some tickets and inquire about Xueyang's illness (Xueyang's illness was treated by Dr. Wang). It was only a friendly inquiry, but Miss You stated in court that I had entrusted Dr. Wang to write a letter to seduce him. This was not only insulting, but also insulting to Dr. Wang. This letter still exists at Dr. Wang's place. If there is any suspicion, it can be requested for public inspection. Later, when Xueyang recovered from his illness, he frequently came to discuss the upcoming International Industrial Conference. I strongly supported his ambition. Before he left, I accompanied my younger sister to see him off. On November 1st of last winter, due to school matters, I went to Nanjing with my mother and colleague, Miss Yuan Jinlan, and stayed at the Jiaotong Hotel on Zhongzheng Street, No. 29. Three days later, Xueyang came to Nanjing with his painting "Mo Ling Ji You" (Record of Touring Moling) and asked the two elders, Tan Zu'an and Wu Zhihui, to inscribe it. Thus, we met. This spring, I led students from the Chinese painting department on a trip to Hangzhou for ten days. Xueyang happened to be returning to his hometown to sweep the tombs and joined the tour group. Everyone has the freedom to act as they please. How could I stop him? Yet Miss You said that wherever I went, I would seduce men. This really broke my heart. Although I have not received as much education as Miss You, I am certainly not as vulgar and narrow-minded as Miss You says. At that time, according to Xueyang, Miss You had already left Shanghai and was taking care of all the household chores herself, and her words were full of resentment. I advised him to write a letter to invite her back, but he said that he had repeatedly written letters, but the other party had replied that their love was broken and there was no intention of returning. I did not leave him, but he has already left me. What can I do? Now, I am willing to use my eight years of sincerity to reiterate my previous request: I hope that you will pity me and allow me. Even if you do not believe that Miss You has left (at that time, it was said that Xueyang had divorced, but in fact, the divorced woman referred to his former wife, whose surname was Jiang), I can come forward with my surname and it will definitely not cause any problems. This is because I am adopted into both the Yu and Zhang families. It is clearly stated in the obituary that I am allowed to marry, and there is no explicit prohibition in the law. However, I still did not believe it, because women are generally kind. If Miss You had resolutely left, it must have been due to Xueyang's impropriety. Therefore, I still sternly questioned Xueyang, who said that the hardship of traveling outside was known. If it was not the truth, who would be willing to abandon a happy family and be criticized? I tasted his words, and they seemed to be the truth. Later, he repeatedly brought up old matters, even</p>
<p>kneeling and weeping, begging me earnestly. No one, no matter how heartless, could remain unmoved. In a moment of helplessness, I agreed to his marriage proposal and was married on May 24th of this year at the Moore Memorial Church. Six years of singleness were ruined in one day, and there was definitely bitterness in my heart. After going overseas, I learned from a friend's report that Miss You had not divorced and that women were harming each other. Xuejiu was not smart and could not bear to do this. Therefore, I entrusted a friend to accompany my younger sister to visit Miss You, explain the situation, and show Miss You the letter I wrote to a friend to show that I had no intention of instigating Xueyang to leave You. However, Miss You then used this letter as ironclad proof that I knew about the marriage. Furthermore, she said that I was fleeing in fear of punishment. If I knew about it, why would I wait until today? If I was fleeing in fear of punishment, why would I come home? After returning to China, I originally intended to visit Miss You immediately, but I had only been home for one day (I arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM on September 18th) when Miss You arrived with the police to arrest me. At that time, my luggage had just been unpacked, and I was greatly shocked, and my spirit was very uncomfortable, so I was lying in bed. I asked my younger sister to invite her upstairs, thinking that even though I had never met Miss You before, I could now tell her my true feelings and beg her to allow me to surrender to the court myself when it opened (it was originally scheduled to open at 2:00 PM on the 22nd). Considering the dust and wind of the journey, I was temporarily spared arrest. However, Miss You, in her great anger, did not allow me and immediately escorted me to the First District of Nanshi, then to the Huisi Police Station, and finally detained me in the women's jail of the Special District Local Court for a whole day and night. The pain I suffered physically and mentally at this time is beyond words. After I got into the car with Miss You, I advised Miss You to think of the two years of marriage and reconcile with Xueyang. There was no need to meet in court and go to extremes. I then</p>
<p>resolutely wished to sacrifice everything and cancel the marriage relationship. This heart can swear to the heavens and the sun. Unfortunately, Miss You regarded me as a fraud, which made my bitterness unexplainable. At 10:00 AM on the 20th, the court opened temporarily. Because my nerves were subjected to all kinds of stimulation and fear, I did not know how to answer the questions in court. In short, I rejected Xueyang six years ago and agreed to him six years later. I was really confused by You's return and the theory of Yu and Zhang's concurrent inheritance, and I was also moved by Xueyang's entreaties. I had no thought of harming others and benefiting myself. The facts are there, and discerning people will be able to see through them. Although I am now a person awaiting punishment, I still hope that the words I told You in the car can be realized. I urge Miss You not to indulge in momentary anger and forget the promise of a hundred years. I hope that she will think of her elderly mother, who is worried and pitiful, and her young child who is losing her shade. How can she bear to quickly cease her hostility? If she can renew the joy of following and accompanying her husband, then Xuejiu will have no regrets even if she sacrifices everything. This sincere heart can be tested by the heavens and the sun. I will leave it to the gentlemen to judge whether I am guilty or not, which is not what I care about.</p>
<h3>French Police Rescue Female Hostages</h3>
<p>Arresting Kidnappers in Minhang</p>
<p>Two Sides Fired Like Strings of Pearls</p>
<p>Kidnappers Were Weak and Swam Away</p>
<p>Two Women Rescued from the Boat</p>
<p>In Xiaoqiaotou, Wuxi County, dozens of lake bandits suddenly arrived on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival in the old calendar this year, looting with weapons and kidnapping several men and women. Later, the victims received letters from the bandits demanding a large ransom for their release, and they were to negotiate the payment at the Huidong Hotel in the French Concession of Shanghai. This matter was detected by detectives from the French police, who successively arrested seventeen male and female bandits, including the ringleaders Lu Shaoda, Liu Fusheng, and Yang Henglai. However, the hostages had been moved by their accomplices to another location and could not be rescued. After being interrogated by the French court, the bandits were transferred to the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau for further investigation. The details of these events have been recorded in previous reports. Now, it is reported that yesterday morning, detectives and inspectors from the French police, including Jin Linjiu, chief detective Li Yaolong, deputy detectives Wang Rusong, Qian Yumin, Mao Jingeng, and Bao Tan Zhang Ziying, received a tip that the hostages in this case were hiding in a small boat in the river near the Deshenggang Xixiang area of Minhang County. The detectives, accompanied by West Precinct Chief Bauer and equipped with firearms, traveled by car to assist the police detectives from the responsible Public Security Bureau, who were traveling in a small boat, in a thorough search of the river. While searching a small river in a remote village more than twenty miles west of Deshenggang Xixiang, they saw a small boat docked there. The detectives went forward to search, but the kidnappers had already noticed them and opened fire to resist arrest. At this point, the detectives realized that they had encountered the bandits and drew their guns to return fire. The sound of gunfire crackled like strings of pearls, and the two sides exchanged more than twenty shots. The bandits were weak and unsupported and jumped into the river to swim away, and their life and death are unknown. After the bandits fled, the detectives boarded the boat and rescued two female hostages. According to one of them, Qiu Shundi, eighteen years old, from Xiaoqiaotou, Wuxi, had been betrothed to someone and was originally scheduled to be married in October of this year. The other, Ling Acai, was the younger sister of Ling Yuanzhen, a timber merchant from Xiaoqiaotou, Wuxi. They were immediately taken back to the French police station and arrangements were made for their families to claim them. However, as it was raining when the hostages were rescued, the detectives were all drenched when they returned to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Vigorously Pursues Murderers of Kwangta Steamer</h3>
<p>Letters Sent to Both Guangzhou and Shanghai Public Security Bureaus to Assist in Arrest</p>
<p>The case of the Kwangta Steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in which a passenger named Tan Dexing was pushed overboard and drowned, has now been investigated, and it has been found that the steward who pushed the passenger, nicknamed "Little Blind," fled in fear of punishment after the incident. The company has sent letters to both the Shanghai and Guangzhou Public Security Bureaus to assist in the arrest. The text of the official letter is as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>On November 16th, the Kwangta Steamer of our company sailed from Shanghai to Guangzhou. At 8:00 PM on the same day, as the ship was weighing anchor from the Jinliyuan Wharf, a passenger named Tan Dexing returned to the ship after shopping ashore. Seeing that the ship had left the dock, he hurriedly climbed up the wooden piles. As he was halfway up, he was pushed into the water. Staff from our South Wharf Inspection Office immediately rescued him, but to no avail. We telegraphed the ship's business director, Zhu Xingao, and the Guangzhou branch manager, Dong Fukai, to investigate and handle the case. Now, according to reports from the director and manager, the passenger Tan Dexing was pushed into the water by a steward nicknamed "Little Blind" (the steward has a slight eye ailment). He then fled in fear of punishment. In addition to strictly ordering the director to hand over the suspect, we request that your bureau transfer the order to the relevant departments to assist in the arrest of the fugitive Little Blind and bring him to justice. This is to maintain public order.</p>

<h3>Two Japanese Walked the Guangdong-Hankou Railway</h3>
<p>Took Twenty-Four Days</p>
<p>Passed Through Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu Provinces</p>
<p>Mr. Suma, the former Japanese Consul in Guangdong, and Mr. Arishita, a secretary, undertook a walking tour of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. They departed on November 10th and returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to Mr. Suma, they departed from Guangdong on November 10th and traveled through Shaoguan to Lechang, a journey of eight days. The sights along the way were all fertile fields. For four of those days, they traveled through towering and dangerous mountains. The two men climbed and walked, sometimes using both hands and feet. The solemn and magnificent scenery of the mountains was the only thing he had seen in his life. They entered Hunan from the Fen Shui Ling, the border between Hunan and Guangdong, and arrived in Changsha on the 17th. They then entered Jiangxi. On the way, they encountered heavy fog. After arriving in Jiangxi, the eight mountains were all dens of bandits. Fortunately, they learned the local dialect and were not harmed. There were few bandits from Lechang to Zhuzhou, but after entering Nanchang, 200,000 Communists were entrenched in Ganzhou, the distribution center for Jingdezhen and Ganzhou. Although Nanchang was not, it seemed to be surrounded by bandits. They arrived in Nanchang just as all walks of life were enthusiastically preparing to welcome Chairman Chiang. Construction on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway was already underway, and long-distance buses were already passable. The entire route could be completed within a year. They said that the construction of the streets in Jiujiang was much more advanced than before. Xun City has a population of 180,000, and the internal and external views are better than in the past. After Suma arrived in Nanjing, he changed to a plane to Shanghai. It took twenty-four days, passing through Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu provinces, without taking a boat. The two men were traveling in a borrowed car.</p>
<h3>Disturbances at Puyi Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>Foreman Shen Aqiao Beaten by Crowd</p>
<p>Secretly Discussing Work Stoppage Due to Livelihood Issues</p>
<p>Thirty-Six Spinning Frames Mostly Damaged</p>
<p>Police Arrest Eight People Awaiting Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Puyi Second Yarn Factory in West Suzhou declared a work stoppage on the 2nd of this month. The male and female workers of the factory suddenly lost their jobs, and their livelihoods became precarious. The workers of Puyi First Yarn Factory secretly discussed a work stoppage in response to the problems, but factory officials immediately learned of it and immediately notified foreman Xu Aqiao to stop it first. At 9:45 PM the night before last, Shen gathered the workers in the factory to dissuade them from stopping work. However, the workers surrounded Shen and physically assaulted him, and turned off the lights in the whole factory. The factory feared that a huge upheaval would occur and reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station by telephone. Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to the scene to suppress the workers and arrested the leading offenders: Wang Jiulin, Chen Xiaosizi, Wu Asan, Shen Er'er, Huang Xiaosizi, Wang A'da, Jin Xiaosizi, and Li Xiaoshunzi. The order was gradually restored. Although the incident lasted only a moment, the factory suffered losses. According to investigations, thirty-six spinning machines and glass doors and windows were damaged, estimated to be no less than 20,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, the police transferred the detained workers to the Special District Local Court. Judge Wu conducted a preliminary hearing. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, and E Sen, the lawyer representing Puyi, successively stated the circumstances at the time. Next, Shen Aqiao testified that he had been beaten in various places on his chest and waist and still felt pain. According to Wu Shuming, an official from Puyi, the value of the destroyed machinery was more than 100,000 yuan, and the so-called loss of 20,000 yuan referred to repairs. Judge Wu then questioned the defendants, but their statements were all contradictory. He ordered them to be detained for seven days pending further investigation. Yesterday, Puyi First Factory did not start work because the damaged machinery could not be repaired in time.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yucheng's Wife Rental Record</h3>
<p>Fifteen Yuan Per Month for a Three-Year Term</p>
<p>Discovered by Legal Wife, Severely Beaten</p>
<p>Injuries Result in Abortion, Leading to Lawsuit in Court</p>
<p>Zhang Yucheng, a Ningbo native residing at 833 Chunyu Lane, Tongzhou Road, opened the Yuanfeng Silk Reeling Factory on Taopeng Road and had considerable wealth. However, he was old and childless and also had a wife who was difficult to control. Therefore, although he intended to take a concubine, he did not dare to do so openly. He then imitated the local custom of his hometown, spending money to rent a wife. After she gave birth to a son, he would keep the pearl and discard the casket, both compensating for the lack of offspring and avoiding the roar of the lion from across the river. Just then, Xie Sanzi, a young widow from the same hometown, was newly widowed. Zhang then rented her for a term of three years at a rent of fifteen yuan per month. Soon, she became pregnant. However, the matter was not kept secret, and Zhang's wife, along with a group of women, severely beat Xie, which caused her to miscarry. Xie then hired a lawyer to sue Zhang Yucheng and his wife for assault.</p>
<p>Zhang hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to defend himself. Yesterday afternoon, Sun Yuan, a judge from the criminal court of the Special District Local Court, reopened the case for continued hearing. The plaintiff, Xie Sanzi, did not appear for questioning. Lawyer Zhan then defended the defendant, saying that the plaintiff's claim of assault was based solely on verbal testimony and no evidence was presented. He requested that her lawsuit be dismissed. Judge Sun reviewed the testimony and immediately announced a judgment dismissing the plaintiff's lawsuit and acquitting the defendant.</p>
<h3>Anlide's Banquet for Political and Business Circles</h3>
<p>Screening of American Transportation Tool Films</p>
<p>Dr. Anlide, the U.S. Commercial Counselor, has been working in China for thirty years and has extensive contacts with the central government, provincial governments, municipal governments, and social leaders. He has a thorough understanding of various practical situations in China's industry, commerce, and economy. Mr. An has traveled extensively throughout China, promoting Sino-American commerce. His essays on China's industrial and commercial construction are numerous. His recently compiled "China Commercial Encyclopedia" and "Several Major Issues in China's Problems" are particularly commendable.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>They are valuable for reference. Mr. An believes that building roads and facilitating transportation is the primary way to solve China's major problems. Therefore, he strongly advocates it. On the previous day, Zhao Youqin, the Governor of Shanxi, Xu Moucheng, the Director of the Fujian Construction Department, and Sun Longji, the former Director of the Shaanxi Construction Department, specially asked Wu Shan, the Secretary-General of the China National Roads Association, to invite them to Mr. An's residence at No. 10 Wenlin Road, French Concession, for a banquet. They also invited Jiang Boqi, the former Governor of Guangzhou, Yin Ruzheng, the former Vice Minister of Finance, Zhao Jinqing, the Director of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Shanghai Office, and Fang Jiaobo, a member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, to accompany them. Gold, the Deputy Counselor of the U.S. Department of Commerce in Shanghai, Shi Fangnan, the Commercial Officer, Wu Hailong, the Deputy Commercial Officer, and Zhu Yangchen, the Chinese assistant, hosted the event and screened American films on the latest road construction and electric transportation until around 12:00 midnight, when the guests and hosts parted in joy. It is said that Mr. Zhao, Mr. Xu, and others greatly admired the various agricultural, industrial, and electric machinery produced in the United States, especially the road construction machinery, which is most suitable for China's construction needs.</p>
<h3>Volunteer Corps Scheduled to March in the Streets</h3>

<h3>Cai Jixiang Returns Safely</h3>
<p>Suddenly Met Cousin Sun Fushan on the Way</p>
<p>Temporarily Invited to Changshu for a Trip</p>
<p>Cai Jixiang, the chief accountant of the Yongmao Rice Shop in the town of Caojiadu, West Shanghai, suddenly disappeared after going to Shanghai to exchange gold jewelry on the afternoon of the 29th of last month. This has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that Cai's family, together with the shop assistants of the rice shop, searched everywhere without success and were in great anxiety, preparing to report to various Chinese and foreign agencies and request an investigation. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Cai suddenly returned to the shop safely and calmly. His family and all the shop assistants were overjoyed and their worries turned into joy. They immediately asked where he had gone. According to Cai, after exchanging the gold jewelry, he was planning to go to the bathhouse when he suddenly met his cousin Sun Fushan. Sun Fushan had received an urgent need for the construction project in Changshu and was forced to take the bus to Suzhou and then the bus to the construction site of Xingfu Temple outside the North Gate of Changshu to assist in various matters. He delayed his return for a few days. However, when he departed from the North Railway Station, he reported by telephone, but he could not get through after repeated attempts. Moreover, as the train was about to depart, he had no choice but to board the train. After arriving in Suzhou, he wrote a letter to the shop to ask for leave, but the letter was accidentally delayed and never arrived. Since he had never left without saying goodbye, and even his cousin's family did not know about it, no wonder all the shop assistants and family members were even more afraid. Everyone suddenly realized this, and a scene of false alarm and fear was finally relieved.</p>
<h3>Fan Yichun Escapes Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Fan Yichun, the young owner of the Fan Yongji Distiller in Qibao Town, West Shanghai, was suddenly kidnapped on the afternoon of the 1st of this month at about 3:00 PM. He was returning to the store from the Zhang family, his in-laws, in Changbang Lane when four men in a car drove up from behind at Guanyintang, the south end of Wu Family Lane Town (about two miles from Qibao Town), blocked his way, and forcibly dragged Fan Yichun to the north. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Later, his family reported the incident to the Qibao Town Sub-Station of the Songjiang County Public Security Bureau and the Qibao Township Security Group of Qingpu County and requested an investigation. It is now learned that Fan Yichun safely escaped from the bandit's den on the 4th (the day before yesterday). According to his family, Fan was slightly frightened and has now returned to his hometown. However, he claims to not know the details of the kidnapping. Luo Yanjun, the patrol leader of the sub-station, is paying close attention to the case and has heard that there are clues to be found, making it not difficult to solve the case.</p>
<h3>Judges of Both Courts to Wear Newly Designed Uniforms</h3>
<p>Starting from January 1st of Next Year</p>
<p>The Judicial Administration Department previously felt that the uniforms worn by judges, clerks, and lawyers at all levels of the court were not suitable for the times, so it specially revised the styles of the clothing and hats and issued orders to all courts and lawyers' associations across the country to follow the newly designed clothing and hats for the sake of appearance. Shanghai lawyers have already complied, but the judges and clerks of the Special District Local Court and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court are still using the old-fashioned clothing and hats and have not changed them. It is now learned that Xu Weizhen, President of the High Court Branch, has issued a special order to the relevant civil and criminal court judges and clerks to wear the newly designed uniforms uniformly starting from January 1st of next year in order to implement the department's order. The new uniforms are also made of Yuan-colored silk, but the edges of the front lapels, collars, and sleeves have been changed to blue, unlike the current glittering gold. The uniforms worn by clerks have black edges. The style and color of the uniforms of the procurators remain the same as the old ones. It is also heard that the judges and clerks of the Special District Local Court will also change them on January 1st in order to be consistent.</p>
<h3>Falsely Established Orchestral Society Sells "Golden Cup Little Champagne" Tickets to Defraud Money</h3>
<p>Recently, Zhou Mingsheng from Luodian, residing on Route de l'Observatoire in the French Concession, colluded with the notorious rogue Xu Yisheng from Shaoxing and others in Shanghai. They falsely established an "Orchestral Society" in name and forged "Little Champagne" tickets from Yinxing Township, using both one-yuan and five-yuan denominations. They hired a group of rogues to peddle these tickets at tea houses and restaurants throughout the north and south parts of the city. They falsely claimed that the one-yuan tickets, for example, were based on the numbers drawn for the "Golden Cup Champagne" tickets from Yinxing Township in Shanghai on December 7, 1930. They said that the first-place winner would receive a prize of 22,400 silver dollars, the second-place winner would receive 6,400 silver dollars, and the third-place winner would receive 3,200 silver dollars. They further claimed that the consolation prize would be awarded according to the "Golden Cup Champagne" formula, with a payout of 1% of the prize money. They stated that after winning, the prize money could be claimed at the "Orchestral Society" on Fanwangdu Road. Many people, blinded by greed, thought the tickets were cheap and the prizes were high, and eagerly purchased them, hoping for a quick path to wealth. However, after careful consideration by discerning individuals, many doubts arose regarding these champagne tickets. They went directly to Fanwangdu Road to inquire, only to find that there was no "Orchestral Society" there. Furthermore, the tickets lacked a detailed location. It was then that they realized they had been deceived. However, the losses suffered were relatively small, so they didn't pay much attention to it. As a result, the number of people deceived by this scheme has become countless. Upon close examination, the front of these champagne tickets was printed in four colors: red, yellow, green, and purple. It was inscribed with the words "Fanwangdu Orchestral Society, One Yuan or Five Yuan, Yinxing Township Little Champagne Ticket," etc. The back contained a simplified charter in both Chinese and Western languages, printed with great care. However, the printed numbers were always above 10,000.</p>
<h3>Yong Sheng Chang Gold Shop Manager and Accountant Collude in Fraud</h3>
<p>Embezzling a Huge Sum of 140,000</p>
<p>Three Managers Arrested</p>
<p>Yong Sheng Chang Gold Shop, located at No. 65 Yuxing Lane, Beijing Road, was established with joint investment from Wang Boyuan and others from the China Reclamation Bank. Recently, rumors have spread that the shop is heavily in debt. Upon hearing this, the shareholders became suspicious. Wang Boyuan convened other shareholders, Gu Yuanruo and Wu Shanqing, to audit the accounts. They discovered that the manager, Shi Yulin, the accountant, Huang Hongxuan, and the salesman, Shi Xianglin, had colluded to commit fraud, embezzling funds totaling 140,000. The day before yesterday afternoon, they specifically hired lawyer Chen Zhongyin to file a lawsuit. At the same time, they reported to the General Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detectives Sun Aizhong and Wang Jinsheng, along with a Western detective, to arrest Shi Yulin and the others. Yesterday morning, they were brought to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Zhou presided over the interrogation. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the plaintiff had now confirmed evidence of fraud amounting to over 140,000. However, they were only charging them with embezzling 8,500 taels because that was the extent of the evidence obtained at the time of the arrest report. The remaining evidence would be supplemented gradually. He also submitted the statements of Huang Hongxuan and Shi Xianglin. Subsequently, Wang Boyuan stated, "My share in Yong Sheng Chang accounts for 20%. Yesterday, I checked the ledger and found an entry for the Yokohama Bank purchasing 250,000 in Japanese gold. Later, it was sold at a loss of 8,500 taels. I then inquired with Wu Yaoting, the compradore of the Yokohama Bank, who said that the bank had not conducted this transaction with Yong Sheng Chang. Yaoting is the father of Wu Shanqing, the plaintiff in this case." He then pointed out this item in the ledger to Judge Zhou for verification and questioned Huang Hongxuan. Huang Hongxuan confessed, "This sum was used by Shi Xianglin for speculation in gold. It was near the end of the year when I was unable to settle the accounts, so I fabricated this entry to cover it up." Shi Xianglin also admitted this without hesitation. Judge Zhou then ordered the defendants to be detained for another fourteen days of questioning.</p>
<h3>Yangjing Town Security Team's Handguns Stolen</h3>
<p>The firearms of the first team of the Yangjing District Security Team in Pudong were usually stored in the bedroom of the drill instructor, Chen Hongsheng. However, the night before last, three handguns were suddenly stolen. Two of these handguns had been deposited by the Shezhuang Temple for defensive purposes, entrusting Chen to repair them. Yesterday, the team leader, Pan Guangqi, discovered this upon inspection. There were no signs of forced entry on the doors and windows of the room. He suspected that drill instructor Chen had committed a major act of theft by taking advantage of his position. Considering that it was currently the winter defense period and fearing that the handguns might fall into the hands of bandits, endangering the local area, he immediately reported the situation in detail to the Shanghai Security Team office for verification and punishment. He also interrogated Chen, who vehemently denied the accusations. Therefore, he was sent to the Second Precinct of the Third District of the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Director Tang, considering the importance of the stolen handguns, immediately prepared a document and sent Chen to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between the New Comprador and New Workers of the Gonghe Steamer</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau has sent personnel to mediate</p>
<p>The Gonghe Steamer, owned by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., which sails the Yangtze River between Shanghai and Hankou, had 84 tea servers introduced by the previous compradore, Huang Zhu, in the winter of 1927. Originally, the steamer had over 70 old tea servers. Due to work-related issues, the workers from both sides had a dispute in June of the previous year. The dispute was mediated by officials from the Hankou Municipal Party Committee and other organizations, and it was agreed that they would work in shifts. This arrangement continued until March of this year when Comprador Huang left his position and was succeeded by Comprador Wang Yunruo. At that time, Wang wanted to lay off all 80-plus new workers, which almost led to a major disturbance. Fortunately, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau handled the matter impartially. The new workers voluntarily compromised and reduced their number to half, leaving only 40. As a result, the workers from both sides were merged into one, and they have been getting along peacefully ever since. However, on the 25th of last month, Comprador Wang suddenly resigned and was succeeded by Comprador Shen Huating. On the first day of his arrival, Shen addressed all the workers and proposed to dismiss all 40 of the new workers, ordering them to seek other employment. The workers had no choice but to appeal to the Hankou Municipal Party Committee and request the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to uphold justice. The Gonghe Steamer arrived in Shanghai from Hankou the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau specifically sent Wang Bin, a staff member from the Third Section, to meet Comprador Shen at the Seamen's Association in the South City. Wang issued a serious warning to Shen, ordering him not to dismiss the workers without a valid reason, so as to avoid causing disputes. After a long debate, Shen said that if the workers had a reliable guarantor, they could continue to work as usual. The representatives of the 40 workers immediately agreed to comply and said that in addition to the existing cash guarantees, they would also provide additional guarantees from reputable businesses. Shen did not express any opinion upon hearing this. Staff member Wang then publicly instructed the workers to continue working on the ship as usual until the matter was resolved and not to take any rash actions while awaiting a solution. Therefore, the steamer safely departed for Hankou at around 3:00 a.m. yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Yang Tihai Dies After Jumping from a Building</h3>
<p>Driven by Economic Pressure</p>
<p>Yang Tihai, a native of Sichuan, was 30 years old. He went to France several years ago to study engineering. Last month, he set off from France to return to China. After arriving in Shanghai, he lodged with his friend Tang Shicheng at the YMCA dormitory at No. 44 North Sichuan Road. Recently, feeling economic pressure and lacking employment opportunities, he purchased poison the day before yesterday (the 3rd) in an attempt to end his life. Fortunately, his friend discovered it and called a doctor for treatment, and he recovered. Who knew that Yang's desire to die had never ceased? Yesterday afternoon at 4:15 PM, when no one was paying attention, Yang jumped from the third floor, splitting his head open and losing consciousness. People immediately summoned the police, who arrived and transported him to the Public Concession Hospital for treatment. However, his injuries were too severe, and he died en route. His body was then transferred to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Shen Junyi Visits Kang Yuan Factory</h3>

They were guided through the various parts of the factory's operations and equipment by Xiang Kangyuan, the factory's general manager, and expressed great satisfaction. That day happened to be the time of the factory's staff and student association meeting. Director Shen attended and gave a speech, mainly saying that the factory had been implementing its factory motto (diligence, frugality, honesty, courage, cleanliness) for five years, emphasizing morality, knowledge, skills, production equipment, school-style management, scientific treatment, and a family atmosphere. Its spirit of revitalization could be compared to the world's most famous German Krupp factory without any shame. He added that its future development was limitless, and he repeatedly urged the staff and students to devote themselves to the factory motto. He also inscribed phrases such as "Entering school" and "Admiration" as a memento.</p>

<h3>Housing Dispute in Gujia Lane, Beijing Road</h3>
<p>Landlord Builds Barricades: Tenants Appeal</p>
<p>He Shengdi, the owner of Gujia Lane, recently issued a notice to all tenants in the name of the Xin Ruihe Foreign Firm, limiting them to vacate the premises by the end of November, vaguely stating that the houses there are in danger of collapse. The tenants specially hired lawyer Ren Zhennan to protest to the owner, He Shengdi. According to the case, He Shengdi had a dispute with the tenants in 1923, and both parties were involved in a lawsuit at the former Mixed Court. The tenants had to increase the rent by 20% and pay the owner a repair fee of one silver dollar, while the owner had to extend the lease to 1933 before being able to rebuild. Now, He has overturned the previous agreement and notified the tenants on January 13 of this year of a rent increase, which was unsuccessful. Now he is advocating for rebuilding. All the tenants have repeatedly stated that the end of the year is approaching, and accounts are being settled. An immediate relocation would have an impact. They requested an extension to rebuild in February or March of next year to alleviate their hardship. During the extended rebuilding period, the tenants are willing to bear the second lawyer's fee to allow the owner to repair the houses. However, the owner, He Shengdi, did not grant their request and, on the first day of this month, actually built barricades, cutting off the tenants' freedom of movement, demolishing walls, and removing tiles. It is now heard that the tenants are appealing to all sectors of society and have hired lawyer Ren Zhennan to file a lawsuit. A court resolution may be unavoidable.</p>

<h3>Pudong Woman Asks to Dissolve Engagement</h3>
<p>Official Orders Both Parties to Settle Out of Court</p>
<p>Huang Fuying, a woman from Pudong, is currently twenty-three years old. When she was thirteen years old, her father, Huang Mingquan, arranged through a matchmaker for her to be engaged to Zhuang Gensheng. However, the marriage has not yet taken place. Now, Huang Fuying has hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to file a lawsuit in the local court to dissolve the engagement. She has been summoned to court, but the defendant has not appeared. A further summons has been issued. The defendant, Zhuang Gensheng, has also hired lawyer Qu Jinyue to file a defense and has presented evidence from the matchmaker. Yesterday morning, Judge Tong Shenglv specially opened the seventh courtroom to continue the trial. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. After the judge took his seat, he first ordered the plaintiff to the stand (asked) whether she was determined to dissolve the engagement (answered) yes (asked) did you know about the engagement at the time it was made (answered) at that time, I was only thirteen years old, so I did not know. Now the defendant smokes opium, gambles, and has no job, so I do not want to. Otherwise, I will only have to die. Next, the defendant, Zhuang Gensheng, stated that he was twenty-four years old, residing in Qiumu Bridge, Yangjing, Pudong, and works as a carpenter. (asked) What gifts were given at the engagement (answered) about seventy-six silver dollars were sent before and after, as well as a gold ring, a gold hairpin, and a pair of silver bracelets. (asked) What is your intention regarding the plaintiff's request to dissolve the engagement (answered) I definitely do not want to dissolve the engagement (asked) do you smoke opium (answered) I do not smoke. I ask the judge to investigate. Next, Huang Li, the plaintiff's mother, stated that she was forty-seven years old, from Pudong, residing in the Second Pond of Pudong, and that because the defendant smokes opium, her daughter does not want to. Then, Huang Mingquan, the plaintiff's father, stated that he was forty-two years old, in the printing business, and that the plaintiff was his daughter. It is true that the defendant does not have a proper job and has received seventy-six silver dollars in gifts. Upon questioning, the judge again asked the defendant, what is your current occupation (answered) I am currently a carpenter at the Blue Funnel Wharf. The judge ordered the witness Huang Lianrong to the stand, who stated that he was forty-nine years old, that the plaintiff was his niece, and that he was indeed the matchmaker. However, the defendant is very honest and does not smoke. The intention was to recruit the defendant as a son-in-law, so the defendant lived in the plaintiff's house after the engagement. The defendant only moved out to live elsewhere in August or September of last year. The official said, you are an elder and should mediate in this matter. The witness Zhuang Quanquan also stated that he was forty-two years old and his testimony was the same as Huang Lianrong's. The judge, having heard the testimony, repeatedly tried to persuade the plaintiff. However, Huang Fuying firmly refused, stating that she would rather die by the knife or by the rope, and that she would not learn to seek death. The judge, seeing that there was no reasoning with her, ordered the lawyers of both parties to settle out of court. If a settlement could not be reached, another hearing would be held and a judgment would be made according to the law.</p>

<h3>Calligraphy and Painting News</h3>

Besides his calligraphy and painting, he is also skilled at seal carving, which is simple and vigorous, similar to Han Dynasty casting. However, he has been busy with calligraphy and painting, so he rarely carves seals. Recently, the number of people asking for his seals has increased daily, so he has set a price of five yuan per character, with a three-month deadline. From now on, in addition to Mr. Wu's calligraphy and painting, people from home and abroad can also appreciate his seal carving.

The majority of the picture frames are made by Mr. Zhang Chenbo, director of the Sculpture Department of the Xinhua Art School, perfectly combining beauty of form.

<h3>Legal and Political College's Guangming Society Invites Pan Gongzhan to Give a Speech</h3>
<p>— Text</p>
<p>The Guangming Society is a prominent academic group at the Legal and Political College, as previously introduced. Since its formal establishment, it has been actively promoting its work. This is unanimously agreed upon, so there is no need for me to say more. The first board of directors elected Zhou Hanbin and Lu Jinsong as directors of the General Affairs Department, Wu Wanbang and Ms. Xie Huishang as directors of the Academic Department, Zhu Airen and Li Chunsen as directors of the Publication Department, and Ms. Guo Shiying and Cao Huichuan as directors of the Lecture Department. On the 2nd of this month, in order to enhance knowledge and comply with the work guidelines, they specially invited Mr. Pan Gongzhan to give his first celebrity lecture, entitled (Party Governance! Rule of Law and Rule of People). In advance, Zhu Airen of the society contacted the school authorities so that students attending the lecture would not be marked absent. On that day, Mr. Gongzhan arrived at the school at 4:00 PM and, after a short rest, went to the main hall to give the lecture. In addition to all members of the society, about four or five hundred students attended the lecture. It was truly a gathering of elites. First, the chairman, Ms. Guo Shiying, gave an opening speech and introduced Mr. Gongzhan sincerely. Then, Mr. Gongzhan took the stage and first humbly expressed his gratitude before explaining the essence of party governance, rule of law, and rule of people. Next, he criticized the fallacies of general extreme legalists and believed that what was needed in this transitional era was rule of law under party governance, but without losing the true spirit of rule of people. The lecture lasted for an hour and a half, unfolding with lively arguments. After the lecture, applause thundered, expressing appreciation. The recorder was Li Chunsen and Li Erbai. It is said that after being整理, it will be published in a certain newspaper soon.</p>

<h3>Indoor Sketching</h3>
<p>— Zhan Bi</p>
<p>This is really an interesting thing!</p>
<p>Every week, everyone feels more energetic on Tuesdays. Tuesday afternoon at two o'clock is our most interesting sketching time. The teacher is very young and exceptionally kind. His face often floats with a lovely smile. The teacher loves flowers by nature. The drawing materials for our indoor sketching are often flowers. Every time the pre-class bell rings, he slowly walks out of the office, holding a bouquet of fresh flowers in one hand and a vase in the other. As soon as he sees us, he smiles and says,</p>
<p>(Today's flowers are very brightly colored. It would be really nice to draw them, and they are so fragrant too!)</p>
<p>Student Ou says,</p>
<p>(There are so many flowers today that we don't need that many for sketching. I want one.)</p>
<p>Student Pi says,</p>
<p>(I want a few too.)</p>
<p>A dozen students run up and surround the teacher. He just holds his hands high. Some of the older students just talk, and the younger students insist on snatching the flowers in his hand and pulling his hand down. Forced to, he deliberately drops one or two flowers on the ground. When they are picking up the flowers on the ground, he has already run into the classroom. Students don't dare to be too naughty in the classroom because they are afraid that the homeroom teacher will see them, which is not good! It will deduct points for conduct.</p>
<p>The teacher is carefully arranging the flowers on the ground. We always say that it is not good to arrange them like this. He arranges them like that, and we say it is not good. He just says to us very kindly,</p>
<p>(Just make do with it. This scene is not well arranged. Just focus on drawing it well. That's all that matters.)</p>
<p>We laugh heartily and bury our heads and start drawing. Although we are late-stage normal school students specializing in art, we have very few practice hours. Every time we sketch, we always need the teacher to correct it. We quickly paint the colors and immediately shout for the teacher to correct it. You shout, and she shouts, and everyone in the classroom shouts, making the teacher run around to correct this one, but he hasn't finished with that one...</p>
<h3>Miss Xian Cuiying</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>We would shout so loudly, all the way to the west side, shouting until the world seemed to spin. We covered our mouths with our hands, giggling incessantly. The teacher only scolded us for being mischievous. But after he scolded us, we would behave ourselves and calm down. Actually, we shouted at him on purpose, enjoying being scolded. We felt that every time he scolded us, he did it with a smile, and we felt more energized to paint after each scolding.</p>
<p>After we had been so mischievous, whispers arose in the classroom.</p>
<p>(Her fiancé is really ugly. She's so cute, it's a pity. Fresh flowers stuck in cow dung.)</p>
<p>(Your lover is really good looking, so handsome, a pretty boy…)</p>
<p>(Do you want me to introduce him to you?)</p>
<p>(I’m going to pinch your mouth…)</p>
<p>Giggles erupted throughout the classroom, leaving the teacher completely baffled. He looked up at us, smiling as we laughed, and he smiled too.</p>
<p>When the students' paintings were almost finished, I secretly ran to take all the flowers and hide them behind my back. The teacher was initially engrossed, but when he looked up after making a few strokes, the flowers were gone. His face darkened, his mouth tightened, but then he smiled and said, "If you want to take them, you should at least wait a little longer. Are they not finished yet?"</p>
<p>I took the flowers and put them in the vase, then took them out again. He just smiled at me, calling me a mischievous imp. The classmates all laughed again.</p>
<p>In this month of September, there were many kinds of flowers, and also many fruits on the market. The teacher liked to paint flowers, and we also felt that flowers could be convenient for us. We could paint them and then use them to decorate our desks. But because we really wanted to eat fruit, we asked the teacher if we could paint fruit. After the teacher finished correcting the paintings and was about to leave the classroom, I ran up to him and said very solemnly,</p>
<p>(Sir, we are tired of painting flowers. Next time, let's paint fruit.)</p>
<p>(Alright, let's paint fruit. But don't you go and take them to eat right away!)</p>
<p>We all said,</p>
<p>(Who would eat them? Who would eat them?)</p>
<p>He didn't answer, but just smiled and left. Some of our classmates were plotting to play a prank on the teacher next time. When he had just set up the arrangement, we would pretend to rearrange the scenery and take those things. Because he cared about his image, he couldn't ask the teaching affairs office for painting materials again. He would definitely take out his own money to buy them. That would be really interesting!</p>
<p>The following week, the teacher indeed brought fruit, wrapped in a cloth, and still smiling, said,</p>
<p>(Oranges, tangerines, pears – they will definitely look good when painted!)</p>
<p>He walked into the classroom, his eyes sharply scanning us, and while setting up the scene, he said,</p>
<p>(Today, please note that fruit is relatively easier to paint. The fun to be had when painting is better than with flowers, but there is no need to change the lighting – it must be very unified – and the colors are easier to distinguish. Today, I'm just saying, for example, if you don't use the colors well, I'll just tell you how to mix them.)</p>
<p>Classmate Changzhen left her seat and said,</p>
<p>(Sir, let me set it up for you. You've arranged it badly.)</p>
<h3>Inside the Jinda Women's Dormitory</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>The teacher really seemed to know our secret. He jumped off the platform and stopped her, saying,</p>
<p>(Today, don't go up to the platform to mess with those secret arrangements. I am not responsible if you take things while joking around and take them away!)</p>
<p>The classmates all laughed loudly. Classmate Changzhen retorted,</p>
<p>(Who told you? I just want to play a joke on you!)</p>
<p>The teacher simply advised her kindly to come and paint. She turned around and sat on the painting bench, giggling again.</p>
<p>The teacher stood on the platform for a full three hours today, and we didn't manage to take the fruit before we finished painting them.</p>
<h3>A Dispute in the Dining Hall</h3>
<p>— Hao Han</p>
<p>In Shanghai, because it is not easy to purchase land, the school buildings are mostly very cramped. Even schools that are well-established and developed cannot expand their school buildings in proportion to the increase in the number of students. As a result, the few dormitories that the school has can only provide accommodation for a small number of students. The vast majority of students rent accommodation outside the school.</p>
<p>Originally, clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four essential elements of life. Humans cannot live without them until they stop breathing. Among the four, the issue of (food) is the most important. Three meals a day, three bowls a meal, this is a required subject in everyone's daily life. After students pay their tuition fees and find accommodation in school, they then need to solve the problem of food. The school does not manage students' meals. Students generally go to find and choose restaurants that are cheap for them to book meals. Aren’t there many restaurants lined up at the back gate of Fudan and the front gate of Zhong Gong? Those are the places where the students of those schools gather to eat.</p>
<p>The situation at Labor University is different. The students' food and lodging are all provided by the school. They live in dormitories prescribed by the school. During mealtimes, hundreds of students gather in a dining hall, where a meal affairs committee organized by representatives from each table manages the school's meals. There is no separation between male and female students; it has been common practice for members of different sexes to eat at the same table for three years. The seating arrangements during mealtimes are freely combined by the students, and everyone chooses their fellow villagers or close friends to form a table. This semester, the female students also organized a table consisting entirely of women.</p>
<p>Is this because women's stomachs are not easily hungry, or is it because they are embarrassed? Before the meal bell rings, many male students have already brought their rice bowls and come to the dining hall. And the female students only arrive slowly after the meal bell has rung. The male students who arrive early cannot just stand around doing nothing, they always need to find something to eat. So they run to other people's tables to freeload. Fearing that they would be embarrassed when the girls came, and knowing that the female students would not arrive early, they ran to the female students' table to freeload some dishes, with the playful mentality of playing a joke. When one person did this, the second person followed suit, and it became a habit. Every day, there would always be three or five people running to the female students' table to freeload.</p>
<p>(Old Pi is freeloading again!) Xu shouted deliberately loudly.</p>
<p>(Hehe, so-so) Pi mumbled carelessly.</p>
<p>(You have to know that the misses have small appetites. We should help them consume some! Haha, not coming to freeload is really foolish!) Lai said happily, being a comrade of Old Pi.</p>
<p>(Humph, this is outrageous! It's simply bullying the weak! Humph, down with imperialism!) Xu protested unhappily.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Every day, conversations like these could often be heard in the dining hall in the few minutes before the meal bell rang.</p>
<p>When the female students came to eat, they saw that the dishes on their table were fewer than those on other tables. If they realized they had been freeloaded, but did not know who had done it, they had no way to negotiate, and could only grumble in secret. Later, when they saw a male classmate from Table A often coming to the dining hall early to eat, they suspected them. When eating, they glared at them, deliberately saying things like, "Freeloading, shameless, without conscience, no personality…" using all possible means of mockery. The students at Table A were suffering from a bellyful of frustration, with no way to vent it.</p>
<p>During lunch today, the entire group at Table A came to eat early as usual. Suddenly, a Mr. Ou came to freeload at the female students' table. The entire group at Table A stood up to stop him. Mr. Ou thought that freeloading was none of their business and did not accept their interference, so there was a big disagreement.</p>
<p>In the evening, a notice like this was posted in front of the dining hall door: (Freeloading is a base and dirty act. University students should care about their personality and not develop this bad habit. Recently, there have been a few bad elements freeloading at the female students' table. The members of this table often eat early because our seats are next to the female students, which has led to the female students expressing doubts about the members of this table in their conversations. In fact, the members of this table have never freeloaded. The injustice of this unwarranted accusation, and the damage to our reputation, is imaginable. We only hope that those who freeload will refrain from now on to avoid shifting the blame onto others. If such behavior occurs again in the future, we will immediately publicly announce their crime. Regret will be too late. Special announcement.</p>
<p>The members of Table A.)</p>
<p>Everyone crowded in front of the door to look at this fresh announcement, discussing which few were the freeloading gentlemen. A Mr. Xi came, looked at the notice, and rudely tore it down and stuffed it into his pocket. At that time, the entire group at Table A was eating, and they saw it all with their own eyes. After a meeting, they mobilized as a group to surround Mr. Xi and question him as to why he tore down Table A's announcement. As a result, the dining hall suddenly became a scene of chaos. The story of the freeloading, which few knew about, spread throughout the entire dining hall. The injustice suffered by the entire group at Table A was revealed to the public by this live drama. The female students should realize that they had wrongly accused people before.</p>
<p>According to the investigation after the event, Mr. Xi did not see the name of the author and did not fully understand the truth of the matter. He thought it was an irresponsible attack and tore it down out of misunderstanding.</p>
<p>From now on, the (freeloading) in the Labor University dining hall will probably not continue to happen again.</p>
