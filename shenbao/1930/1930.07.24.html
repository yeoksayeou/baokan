<p>時評</p>
<h3>世間之天災人禍</h3>
<p>世界一日而存在。則世界上之天災人禍。亦一日不息。各國殖民地之因爭自由而奮鬥不惜犧牲生命而繼續不斷者固日有所聞矣。即如或因慶祝之故。斷橋墮水而死者。如德蘭茵區域之人民。或因地震而死者。如意南境之人民。或因大熱中暑而死者。如美紐約之人民。或因大風暴雨而死者如日之九州與朝鮮之人民。而其他各國。或死於内戰。或死於衝突。或死於盜賊者更無論矣。可知世界之天災人禍。無一日能離人類而息也。</p>
<p>夫所。謂天災者。或過雨。或過旱。或過熱。或過寒。或風過大。或水過多。或地震動而山崩水裂。其所以然者。皆因不由常軌。行動不得其平而已。不得其平則不調順。不調順則顚倒而。横决。而人禍亦然。人心不得其平。則萬事不由常軌。不由常軌則亂。亂則顚倒决裂。無所不用其極。而人類之因以犧牲者無數矣。故天災人禍。雖所致不同。而其釀成此災禍之原。其理未嘗或異。故古人連類而並稱之者。非無意也</p>

<h3>日本軍參會議昨日正式開會</h3>
<p>奉答文照原案通過</p>
<p>政府召集臨時閣議</p>
<p>財部海相準備辭職</p>
<p>電通社二十三日東京電　正式軍事參議官會議、於本日上午十時、在宫中東溜之間開會、除各參議官外、及川軍令部第一班長堀軍務局長亦列席、東鄕元帥就議長席、宣告開會、先由谷口軍令部長說明昨日午後伺候葉山行宫所得御諮詢之議案、即入於審議形式的、由各參議官陳述意見、錄入記錄、十時四十分、通過原案、散會、東鄕元帥以下各參議官、退别室、賜午餐、東鄕元帥與谷口軍令部長、午後二時二十二分出發東京驛、伺候葉山行宫、伏奏會議之結果、於是國防缺陷難於補充之海軍方面意見、至此竟入日皇之耳、政局益形重大、</p>
<p>電通社二十三日東京電財部海相在非公式參議官會議、不得不遵照海軍從來全會一致之愼例、支持東鄕元帥案而承認本人所簽字之倫敦條約之兵力量、</p>
<p>確有缺陷、故財部海相之辭職、兹不過時期問題、而政府方面、决始終支持財部海相與樞府奮鬭、而進行奏請批准手續、但海軍方面長老中、謂財部海相、旣於倫敦會議出發前、明言絕對固執三大原則、歸國後、又更迭軍令部長、惹起海軍空前之紛糾、多主其以部内不統一爲理由、引責辭職、結果財部海相於樞府諮詢奏請後或條約批准完了後辭職、</p>
<p>電通社二十三日東京電　海軍方面所主張之國防缺陷、補充至難、巳於本日正式軍事參議官會議、照原案通過、政府决採最後手段、即進行軍縮條約之樞府諮詢、本日午後召集緊急臨時閣議、决定一切手續、</p>
<p>電通社二十三日東京電　軍事參議官奉答文之内容、極守秘密、聞其要略、大意謂「照倫敦條約之兵力量於作戰用兵上有缺陷、殊難完全補充、」並附言「日本國防最小限度之兵力量、務必貫澈、」軍部謂當草奉答文之際、未絲毫參加政治意義、述其所信而已、其解釋可任政府或樞府之自由、</p>
<p>電通社二十三日東京電　日政府於本日午後二時、開臨時閣議後、即用文書辦理諮詢樞府手續、故局面巳由軍部一轉而至樞府、此後將尚有波瀾、但至遲至九月間當可批准、但政府眞難關、將留在條約成立後、即軍縮剩餘金與減稅關係是、政府因見財部海相在參議官會議、對於補充國防缺陷、處於孤立無援之境、爲求脫出此難關、曾於二十一日午後、在首相邸開首腦部會議協議、决定對於補充國防缺陷、將聽從海軍方面之予取予求、即遣谷口軍令部長往訪東鄕元帥、傳達政府意見、東鄕言、政府意見、眞不能算數、請以首相眞憑據來、聞日政府已有字據交給海軍、作爲後日憑證、政府近稱剩餘金編入六年度預算、恐無多額、似即由於此、軍縮目的之一、本在减輕國民負擔、今若此、眞多此一舉也、</p>
<p>電通社二十三日東京電　濱口首相、根據本日臨時閣議决定、定二十四日午前八時、自東京首途、赴葉山御用邸覲見日皇、奏請諮詢樞府倫敦海軍條約、並委曲伏奏迄此經過、</p>
<p>路透社二十三日東京電日政府對批准倫敦海約事、沉滯多時、今日復見活動、此半由於美國已批准該約、半由於海軍要人對該約之久長爭論、已藉折中方法終止、今日午後内閣舉行會議後、據當局宣布、首相濱口明日壯赴葉山暑宫覲見日皇、奏請俞准該約、然後即提交樞密院核議、該院之討論、約需時數星期、但料該約終必通過、至近數星期來進行之遲鈍、全由海軍主要人員未能將該約影響國防之奏文議妥之故、今晨最高軍事會議之海軍人員在東京御宫集議、商定終止兩派爭持之辦法、蓋一爲加東與東鄕派、極端反對批准該約、一爲海相財部派、主張無條件批准、今就兩派之意見、折中議定方式、雖其内容尚未發表、但悉因該約之限制條件、使日本國防爲露破綻、故擬以擴充航空軍等之方法以補救之、且以該約限期六年、　今日加以批准、可免受重大保險、惟聲明在下屆海軍大會中、日本務須堅决要　各類軍艦百分之七十之比率、此項方式、雖爲政府方面之政治的受挫、但不致引起閣潮、蓋若如是、則海約將難批准也、　衆意該約批准後、海相財部或將被迫辭職、</p>

<h3>鑾江消夏談劉豁安</h3>
<p>十二圩古號鑾江。屬令儀徵縣治。濱於揚子江之北岸。風日清美。隔江山色良佳。</p>
<p>偶來避暑。閒眺江天。雖曉來江氣連城。空存幻想。而夕陽明滅。看沙烏風帆。與夫月湧江流。清風送抱。勞勞客子。固巳忘憂。</p>
<p>儀徵即古眞州。清初有隨園之竹枝云。流過揚州水便清。鹽船竿簇晚霞明。江聲漸遠市聲近。小小繁華一郡城。當年風景可知。</p>
<p>儀之文藝。如柳屯田之曉風殘月。畢倚虹之人間地獄皆千秋名作。不可謂非江山之助。</p>
<p>太平軍後。遷鹽商於圩上。故圩有揚子棧爲鹽政機關。當晚清名宦蒯光典長棧時。張之洞曾經蒞止。爲蒯留棧聯云。積雪中春。飛霜暑露。洗兵海島。刷馬江州。寫作俱佳。</p>
<p>圩之江西會館乃鹽船同鄕公所。余往來卅載。桑梓情深。曾妄擬館聯云。澤國阻風波。喜同舟共濟艱難。長使鹽梅和鼎鼐。襟懷重湖海。願我輩相期遠大。好將萍水化家山。鹽船分十八帮。非徒一省。故下聯如是。</p>
<p>瓜州接圩。兒時曾讀書州上。記二年重過。有詩句云。烟柳舊横京口岸。浪花新撼酒家樓。不無感慨滄桑。相關身世。</p>
<p>王紹榮師死於州。余挽聯云。儒生萬古情。感深知己。揚子一江水。淚共傷心。淚墨交流。莫非眞意。（却酬）</p>
<h3>輓盛省傳先生　武廷琛</h3>
<p>盛省傳先生。諱炳緯。浙江鎭海縣人。簪纓華胄。早掇巍科。先後任川贛兩省學政。退休後提倡公益。奬勵後進。桃李滿門。蘭桂騰芳。洵前朝之遺老。亦民國之人瑞也。盛氏與吾家屢世通家。先生又與先父笏卿公同學摯友。余屢思往見長者。祗以服務本報。晏眠遲起。常致不果。去冬姻伯王海帆先生之喪。余亦往弔。適先生在座。託吾友盛蘭生兄先容。拜謁之下。備承敎益。今春又遇之於賀寀唐兄家。翌日投剌往謁。適先生公出。方謂良覿有期。不謂今夏先生遽歸道山。巍峨道貌。猶在目前。而涵濡雅化。祗有永藏心中而已。輓詞如次。</p>

<h3>跪酒蕙玲</h3>
<p>甘璧笙先生。號甓公。嶺南名士。耽吟咏。善飮酒。嘗於聊社詩叙席上。注酒滿觥。獻諸座客。跪地勸飮。社友中有不任杯酌者。皆大醉。即席以跪酒爲題。各吟詩二絕。甓公詩云。一舉何妨累十觴。更傾三斗助清狂。由來此膝難爲屈。不拜汾陽拜汝陽。名士風流。任心自放。亦士林佳話巳。</p>
<p>嶽降神。共仰達尊。父執少追隨。未入門墻窺美富。</p>
<p>幸我公容我友進言。欣自去冬以後。斗山在望。迭承敎益。哲人何遽萎。興懷梁木總榮哀。</p>
<h3>國貨商場之盛况心聲</h3>
<p>南京路國貨商塲。自上星期六開幕以來。氣象甚佳。上午九時起。直至下午十時止。買主雲集。各櫃俱有應接不暇之勢。因係各廠直接零賣。都照批發價計算。故較舶來品。往往便宜過半。一般買主。莫不滿意。凡居家日用所需。以及一切服御飮食動用之物。一入該場。無不應有盡有。由此以觀。國人殊無購用舶來品之必要。而國産品之廉美。實較任何外國貨。有過之而無不及。其中裝髹門面。俱各鬭異爭新。令人目不暇給。無敵牌商塲。僻在廳之左隅。其前面爲大華鐵廠之鉅幕所蔽。左右公路。又爲别家過街招牌所掩。宜爲衆目所不及。然以布置新頴。用電光胡蝶。以折光玻鏡。重疊映現。頗能引人入勝。故其營業獨盛。每日所用發票之數。當以該社爲最多云。記者於此。頗有兩種感想。（一）中國人並非不愛用中國貨。但看國貨商塲之現象。即足以見國人心理。（二）先施永安亦旣存立多年。國貨商塲。豈必曇花一現。則由此發軔。以底於大成。當可拭目俟之耳。</p>
<h3>白英事件與浪漫女子少謝</h3>
<p>白英事件。已成最近上海社會談論之中心材料衡以事理。則白固一可憐之女郎。而驅使之然者。實社會之惡環境也。據友人言。去夏。白在復旦大學中讀書時。常至男生宿舍之三十九號室閒談。言無顧忌。不作尋常兒女子態。白之言曰。「男子爲女子之奴隸」。實透澈之至。其後。白入舞塲。曾偶述其生活於其舊同學某君。謂「我今爲舞女。月可得三四百金。現社會中。在迫於艱苦生活下者。比比皆是。我亦可以自滿矣。」其意尤寄慨甚深。又豈料事隔經年。終肇今日之變。說者謂白女士有甚深之理智。而不能善用其情感。且行動浪漫。致食惡果耳。</p>
<p>大凡浪漫之習性。必非先天所賦與。而必爲環境所造成。如白英者正一例子。一月前宣景琳女士爲明星影片公司攝製一「浪漫女子」片。其所叙述。雖不與白英之遭遇相同。而對於浪漫女子生活之描寫。則凡學校凡舞塲凡社會中形形色色。若與白英事件有相符處。片述一女郎受環境之驅迫。以至於墮落事。情節至爲曲折。其背景則爲上海社會。魑魅魍魎。怪態百出。片中所寫。實寓驚世之意。他日公映時。凡關心白英事件者。大可一往觀之。以相參證。當恍然悟社會之萬惡與女子之難於自處耳。</p>
<h3>舊報紙的利用　履冰</h3>
<p>陳年舊報。苟能積存無缺。大可分類裝訂。藉供參考。惟社會人士。一經</p>
<h3>筆錄會起（上）</h3>
<p>「筆會」是我們給ＰＥＮ在中國的譯名ＰＥＮ是一九二一年道生司各德夫人ＭＲＳＤＡＷＳＯＮＳＣＯＴＩ」在倫敦發起的一個作家聚殆會。但在這幾年内它己經擴大成爲一個國際作家的聯合會。目下加入的國度有三十三個。己經設立分會的都市有四十多個。從奥斯洛到羅馬紐約到舊金山。倫敦到里加及赫爾洵福市。從蒙德里奥到蒲愛諾斯哀衣雷市。從日内瓦到南非洲。現在再加上我們中國。這筆會的所在地己經蛛網似的織滿了全球。作家所包括的有詩人。劇曲家。編輯家。散文家。以及小說家。寛一點說凡是以文字爲職業而己得相當地位的都有被選入會的資格。</p>
<p>這會在發起時的本意是給在倫敦與到倫敦的文學作家們一個聯歡的機會。它唯一的舉動是每月一次的聚餐。但不久它發見到可做的事項不僅是這一點。雖則關於最初特别聲明過不涉政治或任何宣傳的宗旨。到如今還是遵守着。它在歐洲的成績第一是打破國際的政治的界限。在歐戰的餘波還不曾平靖以前。德奥的作家早已經由筆會的中介紹恊約國的作家在一堂聚首了。筆會會員最顯著的利益。是一個作家做了一個分會的會員。同時即取得了全世界各地分會的會員資格。因而他在國外旅行時可以得到種種的利便。可以經由各分會的介和結識别國裹的文學作家。</p>
<p>但筆會還有它的更大的任務。更大的目的。在比京舉行的那次年會通過了幾條重要的議决。一·文學的起原雖有國别。但它本身却不知有國界。國際上或政治上許不免有糾紛。文學作品應得照常流行各國之問。</p>
<p>二·在任何情况下。尤其在戰爭期内。藝術作品旣爲人類的共業。不當感受政治的或民族的熱情的毁壞。</p>
<p>三·筆會的同人應得善用他們的勢力來求實現民族間相互的了解與尊敬。</p>
<p>瀏覽。輒行遺棄。廢物多堪利用。舊報何獨不然。因舉數端。以實本談。</p>
<p>普通人家。每將閱過之報。捆集出售。每斤所值。不無小補。此項報紙。復由販者轉銷各攤肆。於是糖果花生。均用報紙包裹。費省而便。自屬利用之一道。</p>
<p>夏季曝曬衣服。收藏之際。若用舊報紙加襯。即可免蟲類之蛀蝕。其功用較諸樟腦有過無不及。蓋報紙上印字之油墨。氣味留存。足使蟲類聞而匿跡也。</p>
<p>煤烟薰污之用具。及油脂滿佈之碗碟。洗滌不易。祇須用舊報紙揩擦。立能光潔垃圾箱傾後。即於其内焚舊報紙若干。旣可保持箱之乾燥。復可免油脂之附黏四壁。一舉而兩善備焉。</p>
<p>鐵床上褥墊。每經睡壓。其底面率起縱横之銹跡。清除爲難。故宜將舊報紙數張。平舖隔絕。庶能常保清潔。不染鐵銹。</p>

<p>是印在白紙上的法文。在那九月底。我們將作品送去以後也沒有什麽希冀。早巳將這事擲起了。現在竟得入選。這是出於我的意表。</p>
<p>十月三十那天下午。是天氣清朗的時候。我們從羅佛宫出來。經樗勒拈花園公谷耳廣塲。尚遂麗遂與賽納河畔之間。眼前屹立崇宏壯麗的建築。當我初到巴黎的時候。每見一回。總使人吃驚的。這是法蘭西歷史上有名的建築物就叫做大宫。在幾十級石堦之上毘連並立着巨大的彫像。一種嚴肅樸茂氣象。令人起敬。這便是秋季沙龍的大門了。</p>
<p>大宫。ＧＲＡＮＤＰＡＬＡＩＳ也是法國的舊皇宫。從一六七三年以來。歷代的各種沙龍。都在此舉行。是各國人士賞鑒藝術之所。歐洲十八世紀以來各時代各派的藝術巨子大槪都來過這裏陳列過的他們的作品吧。就只一點。也足夠我們想像出這樣壯麗的建築物的榮華的歷史了。走進宫中。人雖然擁擠。但是十分肅穆。而且發出一種深遠濃厚之味來。我們購了一本「目錄」來按圖索驥依次看。去我其先在國内時。約略知道些秋季沙龍的輪廓。親自看到秋季沙龍的這是第一次。我們先看畫。從西面上樓。走上扶梯的較大一室。當面揭一幅ＬＡＴＩＲＯＮ的人物。四個黑人坐臥在海濱談話。墨黑的皮膚襯着黄的沙灘。蔚藍的海水。這是一種巧妙的敏銳的剌戟。一種穠艶的美感。一幅巴黎聖母院的早晨。又一幅裸體白到像雪樣白。點着脂紅的唇。這是日本人的作品。那邊又卦起三四張斐洲人的生活。曲哥拉那樣的肌膚。配起汕綠的樹蔭。都又是一種濃艶的味味兒。現在瑪諦斯也巡禮到斐洲的泰赫地島上去了。他爲的是尋曲可拉肉色的香味。或者油綠的芭蕉樹。艶黄的沙土。他是想到全野蠻的風土間去發見文化的本眞。開闢藝上的新路。我想他今後的作品。一定於色彩上更有奇異篷勃的發展。最早以黑人入畫的是孟奈那張「奥林比亞」。而最有胆識最富心靈專以黑人入畫而開出藝術上的新感覺來的。是高根。高根固爲愛好黑人之故。也夠受人凌夷的了。他終竟是死在蠻人島上。泰赫地現在歡喜畫黑人的畫家多了。這濃艶的味兒。現代人也已經看慣竟也就生不出異樣的剌戟來。</p>

<h3>棉市比較稳定</h3>
<p>棉市稍定、但人心多數依然看漲、惟外棉立定、致市氣稍靜、有廠商購進七八兩月數千擔、賣出遠月數千擔、致成近堅遠疲、後步須依美棉進退、</p>

<h3>湖北棉作槪况</h3>
<p>老河口一帶生育最佳</p>
<p>本年湖北新棉情形、據報告本年播種期以雨量較多、較往年約遲三星期之譜、生育狀况（一）老河口一帶、（老河口新野棗陽樊城廣水等處）棉苗雨量適潤、發育良好、早種者己有一尺餘高、該處匪禍較輕、耕作進行尚順利、目下初次除草工作已竣預測此處棉收最有希望、（二）漢水中路流域如沙洋·潛江·天門等處、以雨量過多、且因匪患耕作遲延初次除草尚未及半、致雜草繁茂、棉苗發育不佳、（三）沙市方面雨量亦過多、監利有一部份己被淹、又因匪禍、耕作不易着手、棉苗發育亦遲、僅四五寸長、預測悲觀、（四）平漢線方面如三叉埠·孝感·雲夢等處因播種延遲、發育亦緩、但雨量適中情形頗佳、（五）蔡甸家鄕等處雨量太多、影響耕作棉苗發育亦欠佳、</p>
<h3>糧食北粳愈跌新粳仍定</h3>
<p>閘北昨内地來船不多、計十號左右、然走銷之呆、竟屬罕有、北帮高粳尚有少數問津、中次則無人過問跌勢益見劇烈、較之前日須續跌四角之巨、總計三日内普通粳己跌去一元三四角、實綠内地産價銳落、運申轉殷、本埠自東新上市後、人心大軟、廠機存粳又大批求售、洋米亦逐步狂跌、於是乃造成今日之趨勢、斯因大漲後應有之反動也、東新粳出數不旺、仍祗一百餘石故行情仍平、依然二十一元耳、羊秈杜秈情况仍軟此間觀察十七元半之貨、己可算普通高貨、故價格降去甚巨、午後據公會消息、洋米曾告轉堅角左、是以後市微覺帶定、此間秈貨極少、無若何之交易也、白元高定次疲、走銷不甚爽化、大盤因亦不振、此間全日交易甚枯、斛脚因不開展、</p>
<p>滬南河下到源總計十號之譜、本街市銷與閘方相同亦極滯鈍、機粳如特别頂貨尚形平定、如稍見肩下之貨、則批削太巨、故行情較前盤須又短兩角外、市况可稱江河日下也、東新微有見到、去路尚可、價亦仍二十一元薄稻來船見接、然銷塲不旺、各店胃祗揀高略進、而飯消則更爲呆木、頂貨開二十元零五六角之間、羊杜尖情形續疲、裏路將有大批見抵、故後勢恐將更弱通變吊銷欠佳、存到漸厚、市况因此轉軟交易亦淡、價小角許、</p>
<h3>洋糙米漲後復跌</h3>
<p>銷呆終難立足···小去四五角</p>
<p>昨日洋米上午市形平定、交易雖少行情反見起色蓋承前日下午復漲之市氣也、但價高後實銷完全不動、平糶及本街内地之零戸亦祗略辦白秈、小紋糙高貨初開至十一元三角銷路一呆價即平跌、更被浮買嚇出、普通貨開價十一元、午後跌小至十元零五角比之前日最後市價亦小去四五角矣、西貢及大小絞白米等尚有平糶及散戸去化跌勢較緩、計小去一角至三角不等、統市計成交一號西貢四百包價十六元九角、小絞二千包、價十四元四角半至十三元九角、大絞一千六百包價十一元九角至七角、小絞糙二千五百包、價十一元三角、十一元、十元零九角半至二元半云、</p>
<h3>麥市復昻近期尤勁</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上下午開盤後、各月份復呈昻貴之象、尤以本月份之回漲爲更可觀、因洋麥報價回起二三角而本月份標準、雖前因現貨充盈、人心最軟、但至昨日、形勢大變、因聞某某兩行家、對本月份標準、約計須收數十車、致人心立昻、一般浮空、紛紛抵補前之暴落者、今反爲暴漲、遠期各月份、因售戸一稀、市氣亦見帶振、結果本月份較前日回漲一錢二分、八十月份漲三分、九月份漲四分、十一月份漲二分、十二月份漲五分、現麥因標準反漲甚烈、故各檔亦喊起五六分、惟廠家進胃並不貪求、致交易反稀、計開漢口沙市浦鎭麥共二千餘包、由廠家辦去云、</p>
<h3>近俏遠疲之粉市</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈近俏遠疲之象、本月份因北帮頗有進胃、廠家因存粉不豐、又在市塲收進、致人心頓見俏俐、故最高時雖回到二兩四錢四分、遠期亦同時帶漲一二分惟以後各盤、本月份仍堅定、遠期則以内地帮回出仍多、廠家亦未起而抵補、故局勢陸續疲滯、觀後步或因廠家不願交貨、市面或可就此轉定、亦未可知也、結果本月份較前日好七厘半、八月份不動九月份好二厘半、十十一月份小五厘、十二月份小七厘半云、</p>
<h3>標荳餅突漲四分半</h3>
<p>昨標準期餅市况突佳、上午各盤價即見緊二分左右嗣因現消爽化、客帮購買、浮空因此抵補、市塲人心乃趨緊切、下午開盤各帮進意益佳、於是行情又漲二分外、結果較前日七月下期竟漲四分地之多、開一兩九錢五分半、情况甚秀</p>
<h3>絲茶粤省各屬飼育秋蠶</h3>
<p>今屆多數孵育改良種···飼額激增</p>
<p>粤省各屬、今歲春夏兩季蠶繭、均告歉收、官廳與絲商對於秋蠶之提倡、不遺餘力、預訂大批改良種、分售與農民飼育、現下順德·南海·大良·容奇等處、蠶戸類均着手孵化蠶種、今届飼育改良種者居多、飼額激增、四野桑葉亦甚茂盛云</p>
<h3>屯溪珍眉已有動機</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、來路莊之珍眉綠茶、英莊恊和錦隆天祥等行、均趨動辦、婺源高莊抽芯貨、市貨開至二百三十兩、但額數稀少、無關大局、屯溪珍眉、昨市業已成交千餘箱、售價自九十五兩至一百兩、貢熙綠茶、俄國恊助會、昨日業已開辦、價開五十兩至五十三兩、較上年見低十兩、且現下進意不濃、一般茶商、因成本關係、尚多堅持不肯脫售云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新糯米枝歉收價昻</h3>
<p>糯米枝今庚新貨收成較去年爲歉、而出品亦較遜、奈以數稀、市價反昻、首批己到、昨市上牌開至八十四兩、雜牌略减、其餘金山枝亦有續到、身骨大都漸軟、上牌元枝二十七兩左右、次至二十四五兩、扁枝二十八九兩、市象平定、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白喊至八兩一錢</h3>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖微升三一二五、價爲一·二八一二五、紐約期糖九月份價一·二一、回升二分、十二月份一·三一、升三分、明年三月份價一·四○、五月份一·四八、亦各升二分、爪哇現糖價八·九三七五、未有升沉期糖八月份價八·六二五、九月份八·五○、各升一二五、公會粗砂白、市氣更堅、喊價高至八兩一錢、但要手殊寂、後市結果八兩零五分、略有成交、進出均懈、市象尚堅、二十號中砂白七兩九錢、十二號荷赤價升七兩一錢、市均堅挺日糖ＹＲＯ嘜七兩九錢二分半ＹＴ嘜五兩零五分ＹＰ嘜八兩二錢七分半、交易寥落、市形平疲、抛貨荷糖昨華新號售出八號荷赤價四元九角半、十號五元一角半、聞各開出二三百噸、市象頗爲挺俏云、</p>
<h3>五金法西釘又起漲風</h3>
<p>法西釘昨日又現活象、如津帮等紛起採辦、而長江路福建帮等亦多點綴成交十分可觀、雖昨市炎暑逼人、然市場上買出仍有一千三百餘桶、價格美貨七兩六錢、比貨七兩五錢、德日貨七兩三錢半本廠貨扯花色七兩左右、而連日掮客復多操縱、故市價又起漲風、致各檔花色喝價每桶均要提高一錢、是以業中人心思堅昻、後市標準更形樂觀也、</p>

<h3>江海關禁止米糧北運</h3>
<p>大批米被阻在滬上</p>
<p>威烟津均不准裝去</p>
<p>自天津關封鎖以後、南北洋運輸上、曾發生困難、嗣經各客商請求、津關始有外船繳存押稅、華輪呈送稅單之通融辦法、北運之貨、方得騐缷、乃本年我國各地均皆荒歉、而華北尤甚、軍事發動以來、北方需用之糧食、向來全恃南方運去、至是乃發生問題、近日北方因來滬購運大批米糧、而本埠江海關、乃有禁止出口之命令、兹將此事經過分誌如下、</p>
<p>辦米運津向來平津一帶需要食糧、完全來上海採辦、主要者爲麵粉、大部分由滬上各粉廠所承辦、從海道運去、本年美國麥粉、在春季内、亦裝往不少、近頃自禁止麵運出命令頒布以後、天津方面、以南方去粉阻减、民食問題、發生重大恐慌、在一旬前、津埠派員來滬、購辦大批洋米、不論仰光米安南米、均皆需要、聞巳有大批成我、第一次業經委托英商輪先裝往數千包、係直接到天津起缷、但未經起運者尚夥、正待起運、江海關之禁令巳下、便不許出口矣、</p>
<p>接洽裝津據聞首批巳購定者、有數萬包、在上星期内、委托經手人、先向華商輪公司接洽、請予放船代運、當以華輪正值休班之際、乃拒絕承載、遂乃改托本埠英日洋商之北洋班輪分裝之、每輪每次各載四千包北上、其缷貨地爲天津、洋商各輪巳經接裝、本定二十號後報運出口、今已被海關所阻、</p>
<p>禁止報裝承運該項米糧之英日各商輪、其巳經裝船者、有某英輪中載四千包、向江海關報出口到天津提缷、海關以禁止運米往天津之命令、巳經奉到不能出口、立予退關、某英輪以承允客家可裝在前、而生意又大、乃復到海關請求改裝至烟台提缷、藉以避免禁令、再往報裝、又經海關拒絕、謂烟台亦在禁運範圍内、未便改易云云、最後貨主因此米務須裝去、寗可手續上較繁、多納轉運水脚、但必須載去、與輪公司磋商之下、由該公司西人親往海關、請將此項出口米、再行改換起缷口岸、更裝至威海衛提缷、威埠爲英國租借地、當可不關禁令、詎料磋商之下、依然不能通融、海關仍不允其出口、致此米已上船者、祗得提起上棧矣、</p>
<p>轉運消息據昨日續得消息、謂此項被禁北運之米、以威烟津多不能上陸、貨主仍在設法進行、聞改與日航商接洽、由滬逕運到大連灣起缷、再用津連班輪轉去、多納一道運費云、能否裝出、尚不可知也、</p>
<h3>出售租界電話案領團答復外部</h3>
<p>措辭堅决</p>
<p>字林報云、關於上海華洋德律風公司出售事、領事團已答復外部、措辭委婉而堅决、大致係說明該公司之出售、按照英國公司法、業巳正式成立、而工部局之允以特許權讓與國際電話電報公司、亦按照正當手續辦理、此外並表示此項特許權之存任、遇將來討論租界地位時、不致有所妨礙云、</p>
<h3>潘公展談法商水電工潮</h3>
<p>市府正進行非正式接洽</p>
<p>廠方董事會態度極强硬</p>
<p>法商水電工潮自發生慘案後、益趨嚴重、罷工人數已達千人以上、估全廠職工十分之六七、昨日本報記者特訪晤社會局長潘公展氏、詢以善後辦法、兹錄其談話如次、</p>
<p>調解無效　自法商水電工潮發生後、社會局曾試行調解、勞方提出四項要求、以每人增加月薪八元爲主要條件、並以廠方法藉職員、巳增鉅客薪金爲藉口、但社會局二次請雙方代表來局磋商、勞方均如期而至、廠方迄未派員前來、致調解無從着手、</p>
<p>仲裁會議　按勞資爭議法、社會局不能調停時、應呈請市府召集勞資仲裁委員會議解决、故局方已於前星期呈請市府辦理、現正進行與法領等作非正式接洽、但尚無頭緒、至勞資仲裁會議俟接洽就緒後、再行召集、</p>
<p>困難原因此次工潮解决稍感困難者、唯一原因、係廠方實權完全握於法京之董事會事事須請示辦理、而董事會態度强硬、至謂無須受制於中國法律、故工潮益形惡化、前曾由杜月笙君私人資格出面調停、條件均巳說妥、工潮本可解决、但廠方臨時忽又根本推翻、致居間者束手無策、</p>
<p>最後方法　潘氏又謂、倘至萬不能解决時、或當改用外交方式辦理、但現正竭力設法避免最後之一途、且廠方亦以營業爲重、不欲長此糾紛、故預料不久定有相當辦法、現法租界自來水總管四處、均在華界、由當局嚴密保護、自來水廠亦然、務使法租界居民、不至感受缺乏飮料之痛苦云云、</p>
<h3>法商水電工潮昨訊</h3>

<p>社會消息</p>
<h3>美國汽車肇禍的死亡統計</h3>
<p>據美國商務部最近發表的報告、美國連年汽車肇禍的事、日見增加、一九二九年度全國死於汽車者共三萬一千人、共傷男子婦人與兒童約百萬上下人、總計由一九二七年度到一九二九年度兩年度、死於汽車者共八萬三千人、自一九二零年到一九二九年間、共死十九萬零八百五十人、依十萬人爲標準、一九二零年之肇禍死亡率爲百分之十六、到一九二九年巳增爲百分之二七、一九二九年已增至百分之九十三、根據這種結果、肇禍死亡數目快要與車子增加的速率相比了、</p>
<p>這因爲（一）車夫玩忽、（二）路政不整、（三）路燈昏暗、（四）行路人失愼和商務發達的關係、而形成的死亡額、是超過了美國參加歐戰時的死亡額、而且單以一九二九年因汽車肇禍而釀出的經濟損失、總共不下八萬五千萬、假如照今年度前四月傷亡的數目來觀察、其數目一定比去年增加、在政府方面實沒有善法來防止、只有期望在汽車的駕駛上加以注意、（易康）</p>
<h3>紐約市民吸收濁氣之分量</h3>
<p>据美國紐約城市衛生化學實騐室報告、每日空氣最佳時爲午前四時、最壞爲午前九時以後、据以中央公園區附近熱閙街道之居民百萬人爲標準、平均每人在每十五分鐘内吸濁氣一磅又百分之三十五、因此僅自今年正月十一到二十七計算、不清潔空氣之程度從百分之二十七磅到二磅又百分之七、市政當局爲防禦與測騐空氣清潔程度起見、巳决下在每家窗外設置避塵紙、在紙上製就表格九十六空、依其紙上所感受之塵埃等之輕重質量等而爲比例的統計、預定將來可依此結果而爲市民死亡率測騐之一的大助力、（易康）</p>
<h3>世界銀産額比金多十四倍</h3>
<p>據美商部礦務局調查發表、世界之銀産額、從一四九三年起、至一九二七年止、共計一四·○○○·○○○·○○○盎斯、比同期内産出之金多十四倍、此數量之銀可將紐約百老匯路中從巴脫雷至中央公園之一段（四哩餘）街面平舖至六吋之高、自一四九三至一六○○之一百○八年間、世界産銀七四七·○○○·○○○盎斯、自一六○一至一七○○之百年間、産銀一·二七二·○○○·○○○盎斯、自一七○一至一八○○之百年間、産銀一·八三三·○○○·○○○盎斯·此數尚不及一九一九至一九二七年間之産額、自一四九三至一八八○○之三百○八年間産銀三·八五二·○○○·○○○盎斯、此數猶不及自一九○九至一九二七年間之産額、自一八八八年迄今所産之銀、比自一四九三至一八八七年間所産爲多、換言之、即三百九十六年間所産之數不及最近三十九年間所産者云、</p>
<h3>東京罪案一年間增一倍</h3>

<p>詩歌是素來被稱爲文藝中最最美麗的花朶的、所以文藝而缺少詩歌的作品、正是文藝的墮落、在墮落了的中國文藝界中、我們看見一部很好的詩歌集、并且這部集子中的作品、都是有一個中心意識的、所以我等不得那詩集中出版、特先來介紹一下、</p>
<p>第一首我要介紹者、是「我們這一代」、作者是方光明、</p>
<p>姊姊妹妹、哥哥弟弟、</p>
<p>我們只有十五六歲的年紀、</p>
<p>我們都有强壯的身體、</p>
<p>我們都有無限的勇氣、</p>
<p>我們中華、河山美麗、</p>
<p>我們少年、團結一起、</p>
<p>姊姊妹妹、大家勉勵、</p>
<p>哥哥弟弟、大家勉勵、</p>
<p>我們的曾祖祖父常常嘆氣、</p>
<p>爲了中國民生的凋弊、</p>
<p>我們的父親、我們的毌親、</p>
<p>常爲民族的衰頽而流涕、</p>
<p>他們的時代已屬過去、</p>
<p>現在是我們這一代了、</p>
<p>我們來奮鬥、前朴後繼、</p>
<p>打倒國際間的一切暴戾、</p>
<p>我們愛護中華民族、</p>
<p>民族的光榮永久不替、</p>
<p>大家看、青天白日的國旗、</p>
<p>今朝臨風摇曳、</p>
<p>這首詩歌、我們讀過後、眞覺得眼前一片光明、詩中所謂「我們這一代」不是我做介紹文的人的一代、也不是作者這一代、是指我們的次一代、我們這一代、實在太可憐了、一切的苦難、一切的黑暗、都是要我們自己負責的、我們次一代、我們總盼望不似我們這一代這樣的腐化惡化、</p>
<p>我們的作者、積極地熱情地樂觀地預想到我們次一代的情景、剌戟我們起來努力、一掃從來靡靡之音的·肉麻當有趣的詩歌、眞正值得大家歌唱的、現在我們再介紹同一作者的「迎上前去」、</p>
<p>弟兄、向前衝</p>
<p>我們是中華民族的先鋒、</p>

<p>弟兄、向前衝、</p>
<p>我們來顯示自己的奂勇、</p>
<p>迎上前去、迎上前去、</p>
<p>我們的事業是烈烈轟轟、</p>
<p>我們覺得在當今中國文藝這樣混亂墮落的時代、正宜來一個青天的霹靂把那一般近視的盲撞的自巳關在象牙塔裏的文藝家來驚醒、同時全國的民衆、也正需要這樣光明的熱烈的詩歌來興奮一下、聽說這幾首歌已經由音樂製譜者在製譜了、我們希望那樂譜也能夠早一點出來、給全中國青年來同聲歌唱、還有方君的許多歌以及旁的著作者的作品、也都是有一貫的中心思想而且文詞音調都不失爲詩歌界的新天地、可是這篇介紹已寫得多了、不便再寫了、好在那詩歌集不久可以印出來了、大家可以痛唱一下、</p>
<h3>誓言增</h3>
<p>陳伯吹作</p>
<p>固然、最近中國的詩壇是沉寂得可憐、所以造就這樣不良現象的主因、實是爲了大部份的詩人終日在「粗製濫造」、「無病呻吟「、失去了最高藝術的表現底詩的原則、我們覺得中國詩壇的異樣消沉並不如何的值得嘆惜、一般青年的詩人以爲寫詩是偶爾的一種文藝上的消遣、徒然地悲哀地呻吟一下、不是意識地去創造偉大的詩篇、作爲藝術上的欣賞品、關於此、我們對於中國詩壇的前途抱着無上的悲觀、同時對於中國青年詩人的前途也有些寒慄、</p>
<p>海低（ＨＵＮＴ）先生曾經這樣的說、「詩是熱情對於眞、美、力的表白、牠把牠的槪念具體化、以想像爲用、且把言語調整、使合用於多樣統一的音節的原則」、將這段話加諸中國詩人的肩上、似乎對之無愧的却屬寥寥、難道坐在愛人的腿上哼幾句花月風清、或是躺在咖啡店裏的沙發上寫一些無病呻吟彷彿似辭的詩句、便能算作詩嗎、</p>
<p>最近我讀了陳伯吹君的詩「誓言」、我客觀地覺得他底詩在每一字行之間、流露着眞·美·力的表白、給予我多量在其它詩集中找不到的新的印象、海低先生的話陳君擔當得起與否在我當然還不敢武斷、至少我堅决地承認陳君這部小小的「誓言」是成熟的詩集、</p>
<p>在量上實在不是什麽洋洋大觀、祇要靜心的在十分鐘以内便能將這詩集全部讀完、原來在國外以一首偉大的詩篇轟動整個世界文壇的也大有人在、所以</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>我們祇要注意於詩質的優劣、至於詩的數量多寡、决不有礙詩底内容的、陳君的「誓言」、祇包含「逡巡」、「夜行者」、我全身感覺輕飄」、「晚風吹起你白色的衣裳」、「你莫要有」、「誓言」、「我向你說一聲我去了」、「我今天到過我愛人的家」、「我常常要這樣的這樣的想」、「只要再見一見」、「月這麽亮」、「愛的墓門」等十二首詩篇每一首詩、當然有它底獨立性、而且各有各的風格、我們讀了、有似在先是喫的蜜棗、其次忽然又渖到鮮荔枝的美味了、在所食的物品固然不同、但滋味的美却有一貫的統一性、這就是說、詩底風格、是可以隨作者的藝術的手腕而創造的、但是這所表現的不同風格又都是代表作者自己的、在讀者看了是很能引起新的奮興、吟頌起來另有一種特異的旨趣、一點也不感覺讀後的厭倦、祗想連續地讀了下去、一首詩、能夠吸收着讀者的心、無疑地是值得再三歌吟的詩篇了、如果將這十二首詩次序地連合起來、便是一首極其完美的長詩、同時也是作者對一個女子所發出的「誓言」、</p>
<p>現在　我們來看作者的詩所表現着的不同的風格、</p>
<p>我向你說一聲、</p>
<p>「我去了」、</p>
<p>你緊閉你的口、</p>
<p>不回答、</p>
<p>啊、你緊閉你的口、</p>
<p>不回答、</p>
<p>我向你說一聲、</p>
<p>「我去了、」（我向你說一聲我去了）</p>
<p>我心裏只是害怕、</p>
<p>你家那間屋子暗而且大、也倒古雅、</p>
<p>掛着幾幅字畫、瓶裏還揷着臘梅花、</p>
<p>我心裏只是害怕、（我今天到過我愛人的家用這樣的格式來寫詩、可以說是作者的創始、詞句等等都是極其平常、實在在這平常之中含有明白樸質的美爲另的詩人所不能寫出來的、在音節方面、作者也很注意、但也是趨向於自然一點未曾矯揉造作、而且時常以同樣的字爲脚韻、這亦爲作者的獨創、</p>
<p>作者又頗帶有尼采厭世的色彩、爲了失戀、在「愛的摹門」一詩裏曾有這樣的結束、「就在這個」、這個月光幽澹的黄昏、我要去、要去叩開那戀愛的墓門、」這實代表作者自已對於戀愛的總結、實際走進了「戀愛的摹門」仍是虚僞與空虚、原來戀愛根本也就是這樣的一件東西、　　在這一點、作者也祇有消極、並不會確鑿的解决失戀後的唯一的方針是怎樣、如果要獲得眞正的愛果、决不是在進了「戀愛的墓門」而能有所見到的、我以爲作者以後須進取地努力、不要以爲失了愛而犧牲掉自已的一切這顯然的、犧牲掉自巳的一切也獲不到相當的代價、這不過是作者未曾得到向上的中心意識對於詩的本質當然沒有絲毫的妨碍、</p>
<p>技巧上、毌須說作者是獲得異樣的成功、每一首詩、所表現的都是難能可貴的圓熟、倘若作者能夠努力於發揚中國民族精神的詩歌、用這樣含有明白樸質的美的風格寫了下來、灌輸到民間去、定可以得到驚人的效果、同時、我敢相浮、作者所寫的定比現在發表過所謂失戀的詩歌必更偉大、因爲作者對於兒童詩歌也有相當的研究、在「誓言」詩集也很可以看出一點、不然的話、作者的詩不會每一首都有這樣的自然音節、明白了解、</p>
<p>在最近中國寂寞巳極的詩壇上、發現了這樣的一本詩集、委實值得我們注意的、現在僅將我讀這詩集所感覺到的寫了出來、介紹於讀者之前、諒亦同情的吧、</p>

<h3>Chiang Cables Central Government on Victory</h3>
<p>Enemy Losses on the Longhai Line are Substantial</p>
<p>Meritorious Generals Promoted Separately</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Twenty-second telegram to the Central National Government states that during this time of Yan Feng's rebellion, I, Zheng, was ordered to suppress it. In a blink of an eye, more than two months have passed, yet I have not completed the task of pacifying the rebels. I am deeply ashamed. The rebel army is in an inherently defeated position. The three tactics they rely on to resist are: first, colluding with reactionary elements nationwide to restrain our military strength and prevent concentration; second, utilizing local bandit troops to disrupt our rear and delay our army's advance; and third, fabricating false claims of North-South divisions to deceive their simple-minded soldiers and drive them to their deaths. However, since Zhang Gui was dealt with, no reactionary troops can restrain our military strength. Wan Xuancai has been captured, Fan Zhongxiu was bombed to death, and Sun Dianying is surrounded. The bandits will also be gradually eliminated. The Feng Yan bandit troops have repeatedly risked their lives to attack, but to no avail, only inflicting casualties on their elite. Recently, I heard that our reinforcements are about to arrive, and their panic is growing, and their situation as trapped beasts is becoming more intense. From the 11th to the 20th of this month, during these ten days, the rebel army exhausted all its strength to attack our Longhai front, attack our Pinghan armies, and attack our besieging Bozhou troops, but all brought about their own destruction. Now their entire strength has been completely lost. The resolution is not difficult and can be expected soon. Those who attacked our Longhai front were the Jin rebels Sun Chu, Yang Xiaoou, Guan Fuan, and others. From the 11th to the 22nd, they concentrated heavy artillery fire, firing no less than 20,000 rounds at the positions of our 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 23rd divisions at Libaji. In the end, their attacks were ineffective, and they suffered heavy casualties. Those who attacked our left flank of the Longhai line were the three divisions of Feng rebel Sun Liangcheng's troops, along with Zhang Zizhong, Ji Hongchang, Ge Yunlong, and others. They called themselves the Iron Army. On the 13th and 14th, they first attacked our 8th Division and 52nd Division's positions at Pinggang and Li Xuanlou, but failed. On the 15th, 16th, and 17th, they attacked the positions of our 47th Division, continuously firing over 20,000 rounds with over a hundred heavy artillery pieces and heavy mortars, causing smoke to cover the sky and our soldiers unable to open their eyes. Then, with dense formations, they charged with hand grenades and broadswords for close combat. But our army calmly responded, waiting for them to approach before sweeping them with machine guns. The entire rebel army was wiped out, yet they continued to attack, with some charging out of the defensive perimeter as many as eleven times a day. Therefore, in this battle, the rebel army's deaths amounted to over 20,000. Sun Lianzhong, with his three divisions, attempted to relieve the siege of Sun rebel in Bozhou, but after being fiercely attacked by our 7th, 10th, 12th, and 54th divisions, almost none escaped. Bozhou has now been completely recovered. The rebel armies of Tian Jinkai, Zhang Weixi, and others on the Pinghan Railway also continued to attack the positions of our 10th and 7th armies from the 11th to the 18th, and on the 14th, they strictly ordered the capture of Yancheng within three days, but all were completely defeated. Now the rebel army has retreated to the north of Xuchang. The rebel army, having undergone attrition, and now suffering a major blow in their final struggle, has almost lost all combat capability. From now on, our army's victory is practically assured. Thanks to the spirit of the late Premier in Heaven and the courage of the soldiers, we have achieved this. It is worthy of comforting our Central Government. The meritorious generals, Wang Jun, Wang Jinyu, Xu Yuanquan, Yang Hucheng, Gu Zhutong, and Jiang Dingwen, have been promoted to commanders-in-chief, Shangguan Yunxiang has been promoted to army commander, and Hao Menglin, Xiao Zhichu, and Yang Shengzhi have been promoted to deputy army commanders. Please approve the record to show encouragement. We will continue to supervise the generals and soldiers, redouble our efforts, and strive to eliminate the rebel atmosphere in the shortest time, in order to live up to the Central Government's supreme intention of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. This telegram is respectfully reported, and I implore your scrutiny. Chiang Kai-shek bows in respect (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Natural and Man-Made Disasters in the World</h3>
<p>As long as the world exists for a day, natural and man-made disasters in the world will not cease for a day. It is already common knowledge that the colonies of various countries are struggling for freedom and are continuing to sacrifice their lives. For example, people in the Derain region died because a bridge collapsed and fell into the water during a celebration; people in southern Italy died because of earthquakes; people in New York, USA, died because of heatstroke; people in Kyushu and Korea, Japan, died because of storms and rain. And other countries, whether they die from civil wars, conflicts, or thieves, are even more numerous. It can be seen that natural and man-made disasters in the world cannot be separated from human beings for a single day.</p>
<p>What is called a natural disaster is either excessive rain, excessive drought, excessive heat, excessive cold, excessive wind, excessive water, or an earthquake that causes mountains to collapse and water to crack. The reason for this is that they do not follow the normal course and their actions are not balanced. If they are not balanced, they will not be in harmony. If they are not in harmony, they will be overthrown and run wild. And so it is with man-made disasters. If the human heart is not balanced, then all things will not follow the normal course. If they do not follow the normal course, there will be chaos. If there is chaos, there will be overthrow and rupture, and everything will be used to the extreme. Countless human beings have sacrificed themselves because of this. Therefore, although the causes of natural and man-made disasters are different, the principle of their origin is never different. Therefore, the ancients called them together in the same category, which was not unintentional.</p>

<h3>Sino-Russian Negotiations Stalled</h3>
<p>The Russian Side Refuses to Pre-Determine the Issue of the Eastern Railway</p>
<p>(Harbin) At the Sino-Russian conference, the Russian side, based on the Boli record, proposed to pre-determine the draft treaty on embassies, consulates, and commerce, without making any concessions. The Russian side did not agree to the issue of the Eastern Railway, which was proposed by our side as a prerequisite. Mo and Jia met on the 20th and debated this for a long time, but to no avail. Now the conference has returned to a standstill. Mo Dehui telegraphed to a certain party, stating that Russia is taking a wait-and-see attitude because of our country's internal war, and intends to take advantage of the opportunity and has other intentions. The negotiations are therefore difficult. (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Tariff Abolition Conference Postponed</h3>

<h3>Disturbances in Egypt Continue</h3>
<p>Cairo is Under Extraordinary Guard</p>
<p>Egyptian King Rejects People's Party Petition</p>
<p>Reuters, Poseidon, 22nd - Disturbances broke out here again this afternoon. Mobs attempted to burn down the stables of the Municipal Council. Police were forced to open fire on the crowd, resulting in one death and two injuries. Egyptian troops have rushed to the scene of the disturbances, which are currently confined to areas inhabited by Egyptians and do not involve foreign residential areas.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd - British Foreign Secretary Henderson stated in the Lower House today that the Egyptian government itself has indicated that there is no need to adopt special protection plans. The British government is well aware of Britain's responsibilities under the declaration to protect the lives and property of foreigners in Egypt.</p>
<p>Reuters, Alexandria, 23rd - According to reliable sources, the petition by the Egyptian National Party to convene a special session of parliament on July 26 has been rejected by the Egyptian King. National Society, London, 22nd - The Cairo correspondent of the Daily News now believes that the Egyptian King has seriously considered abdicating, which would cause the cabinet to resign immediately.</p>
<p>National Society, Cairo, 22nd - Many riots also occurred in various provincial towns last night. Although most have restored order, in Port Said, protesters attempted to set fire to the city-owned stables again and were shot by police, killing two and injuring many. However, the situation is still critical. Currently, all parties are eagerly awaiting the Egyptian King's response to the National Party's request to immediately convene a special session of parliament. Only a few shops are open in Cairo. In the streets, soldiers with rifles and bayonets are constantly patrolling. Machine guns have been set up in front of public buildings and important places. However, according to the prime minister's interview with reporters, the internal situation is not as serious as it appears on the surface. Monday's riots were not revolutionary in nature, as villagers were unwilling to stop working to participate in the demonstrations, resulting in complete failure. It should be known that the Italian-French dispute cannot be resolved by riots.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Council Formally Meets Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Draft Reply Was Passed as Originally Proposed</p>
<p>The Government Convenes an Emergency Cabinet Meeting</p>
<p>Finance Minister and Navy Minister Prepare to Resign</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - The official military council meeting was held in the East Hall of the Imperial Palace at 10:00 this morning. In addition to the council members, Major General Horikawa, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, also attended as the first head of the Naval General Staff. Marshal Togo took the seat of chairman and announced the opening of the meeting. First, General Taniguchi, Chief of the Naval General Staff, explained the draft proposal consulted at the Hayama Imperial Villa yesterday afternoon. Then, the formal review began. Each council member stated their opinions, which were recorded. At 10:40, the original proposal was passed and the meeting adjourned. Marshal Togo and the other council members retired to a separate room and were given lunch. Marshal Togo and General Taniguchi left for Tokyo Station at 2:22 p.m. to serve at the Hayama Imperial Villa to report the results of the meeting. Thus, the opinion of the Navy, that defense defects are difficult to remedy, eventually reached the Emperor's ears, making the political situation even more significant.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - At the informal council meeting, Finance Minister Zaibu had no choice but to follow the Navy's consistent practice of supporting Marshal Togo's proposal and acknowledging the naval power strength in the London Treaty he signed.</p>
<p>There are indeed defects, so the resignation of Finance Minister Zaibu is only a matter of time. However, the government has decided to support Finance Minister Zaibu and fight with the Privy Council from beginning to end to proceed with the procedures for requesting approval. However, among the elders of the Navy, it is said that Finance Minister Zaibu clearly stated before departing for the London Conference that he would absolutely adhere to the three major principles. After returning to the country, he repeatedly changed the Chief of the Naval General Staff, causing an unprecedented conflict within the Navy. Most of them believe that he should resign to take responsibility for the internal disunity. As a result, Finance Minister Zaibu will resign after the Privy Council consults and requests approval or after the treaty is ratified.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - The Navy's claim that defense defects are difficult to remedy was formally passed as originally proposed at today's military council meeting. The government decided to take the final step, which is to consult the Privy Council on the arms reduction treaty. An emergency cabinet meeting was convened this afternoon to decide on all procedures.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - The content of the military council's reply is extremely secret. It is said that the main idea is: "The naval power strength under the London Treaty has defects in wartime use and is extremely difficult to fully remedy." It also adds: "Japan's minimum level of defense power must be thoroughly implemented." The military said that when drafting the reply, they did not participate in any political significance, only stating what they believed. The interpretation is left to the government or the Privy Council's discretion.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - The Japanese government, after holding an emergency cabinet meeting at 2:00 p.m. today, immediately proceeded with the procedures for consulting the Privy Council in writing. Therefore, the situation has shifted from the military to the Privy Council. There will be more waves in the future, but ratification is expected to occur by September at the latest. However, the real difficulty for the government will remain after the treaty is established, namely, the relationship between the surplus from arms reduction and tax cuts. Because Finance Minister Zaibu was in an isolated and helpless position at the council meeting regarding supplementing defense defects, the government held a summit meeting at the Prime Minister's residence on the afternoon of the 21st to discuss how to escape this predicament. It was decided that the government would listen to the Navy's demands regarding supplementing defense defects, that is, sending General Taniguchi, Chief of the Naval General Staff, to visit Marshal Togo to convey the government's opinion. Togo said that the government's opinion could not be counted on. Please provide concrete evidence from the Prime Minister. It is said that the Japanese government has given the Navy written evidence to serve as proof for future use. The government recently stated that the surplus will be incorporated into the sixth-year budget, and it is feared that there will not be much money. This seems to be due to this. One of the purposes of arms reduction is to reduce the burden on the people. If it is like this, it is truly unnecessary.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - Prime Minister Hamaguchi, based on the decision of today's emergency cabinet meeting, is scheduled to leave Tokyo at 8:00 a.m. on the 24th to visit the Hayama Imperial Villa to meet the Emperor, to request consultation with the Privy Council on the London Naval Treaty, and to report in detail on the progress made so far.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd - The Japanese government's actions on ratifying the London Naval Treaty, which had been sluggish for a long time, have resumed today. This is partly because the United States has already ratified the treaty, and partly because the long-standing dispute over the treaty among naval leaders has ended through compromise. After the cabinet meeting this afternoon, authorities announced that Prime Minister Hamaguchi will travel to the Hayama Imperial Villa tomorrow to meet the Emperor and request approval of the treaty, which will then be submitted to the Privy Council for review. The discussion by the Privy Council is expected to take several weeks, but it is expected that the treaty will eventually be passed. The slowness of the proceedings in recent weeks has been entirely due to the inability of key naval personnel to agree on a memorial to the Emperor on the treaty's impact on national defense. This morning, naval personnel from the Supreme Military Council gathered at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo to discuss and resolve the dispute between the two factions. One faction, led by Kato and Togo, was vehemently opposed to ratifying the treaty, while the other faction, led by Navy Minister Zaibu, advocated unconditional ratification. Now, a compromise has been reached on the opinions of the two factions. Although its content has not yet been announced, it is understood that due to the treaty's restrictive conditions, Japan's national defense is exposed to loopholes. Therefore, it is planned to remedy this by expanding the air force and other methods. Moreover, with the treaty limited to six years, it is possible to avoid major insurance risks by ratifying it today. However, it is declared that in the next naval conference, Japan must resolutely demand a ratio of 70 percent for all types of warships. Although this compromise is a political setback for the government, it will not cause a cabinet upheaval. If so, the treaty will be difficult to ratify. It is widely believed that after the treaty is ratified, Navy Minister Zaibu may be forced to resign.</p>
<h3>US President Formally Signs the London Naval Treaty</h3>
<p>Congressmen Flock to Summer Resorts</p>
<p>Newspaper Editorials Hold Divergent Views</p>
<p>National Society, Washington, 22nd - President Hoover formally signed the London Naval Treaty at 3:01 p.m. today in the East Room of the White House. The ceremony was simple. All US representatives who attended the naval conference, including Stimson, Adams, Robinson, and Reed, were present. In addition, Vice President Curtis and several senators were also present. The weather has been unusually hot in recent days, and the senators who have been participating in special meetings every day have been suffering greatly. Therefore, as soon as yesterday's special meeting adjourned, the congressmen packed their bags and went to various summer resorts. It is said that if it were not for the recent heat wave, the passage of the treaty would not have been so smooth. Newspapers are still divided into two factions: supporters and opponents. The opponents continue to attack the treaty without slackening. Newspapers calling themselves the "Big Navy Faction" are filled with criticisms of the treaty, saying that it will not have good results in the future. And a group of newspapers that extremely advocate limiting naval preparations fear that the treaty cannot achieve actual naval restrictions. Other newspapers that support the treaty say that the passage of the treaty is a legitimate step. Even if it cannot be fully achieved at once, it at least proves that Americans are inclined to international thought. Some people are worried that Japan's naval buildup will increase and the United States will abandon its fortification rights in the Pacific, but they are few in number and therefore not taken seriously.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd - British Prime Minister MacDonald, referring to the US Senate's passage of the London Naval Treaty yesterday by a vote of 58 to 4, said in the Lower House today that, in light of the circumstances, the second reading of the British Naval Treaty should proceed immediately in order to realize it as soon as possible and should not be delayed until the fall. According to the schedule, the current session of Congress will end at the end of this month, but the British Prime Minister believes that the consideration of the second reading of this bill will not take much time. Reuters, Washington, 22nd - US President Hoover signed the London Naval Treaty this afternoon. The US President said that after other governments ratify the treaty, it will transform a sentiment held in the hearts of billions of people into a practical covenant of government and international relations, and will make the world re-trust the moral power of goodwill and patient negotiation, and not trust the blind power of suspicion and armed competition. The treaty can also safeguard the United States' complete defense.</p>
<h3>US President Concerned About Income Tax</h3>
<p>National Society, 22nd - According to today's news, President Hoover is deeply concerned about the future increase in income tax. Mr. Hoover is currently advocating that all government agencies cooperate to reduce expenses in order to have a surplus of US$100,000,000 to make up for the historical deficit. If an increase in income tax suddenly occurs at this time, it will make his plan to reduce government expenses even more difficult. According to Treasury Secretary Mellon, no matter how much the government tries to economize, an increase in income tax will likely be unavoidable when the current fiscal year ends. What is now being worried about is that this move will greatly disappoint the public. Mr. Hoover is now urging all cabinet members to plan ways to ensure that each department can achieve the lowest level of thrift.</p>
<h3>US Republican Party Undertakes Reorganization</h3>
<p>National Society, Washington, 22nd - Republican leaders today undertook reorganization to prepare for the autumn parliamentary election campaign. Senator Moses will be in charge of party affairs east of the Mississippi River, while Senator Steiwer will be responsible for propaganda in both departments. The party's reorganization this time proves that it is aware that only those familiar with local conditions can handle affairs. After the passage of the new tariff law, leaders from the agricultural states in both departments have expressed dissatisfaction. The party's move is largely aimed at addressing this issue.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minseito Party Lobbies the Entire Country</h3>

Prime Minister Hamaguchi will also appear at the Kanto and Kansai conferences held in Tokyo and Osaka to give a major speech.</p>
<h3>Tragedy Amidst Celebrations in Rhineland</h3>
<p>Reuters, Koblenz, 22nd - A tragedy occurred during the celebrations of the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Rhineland. Tonight, there was a fireworks display in this area to welcome President Hindenburg's visit. Late at night, viewers were returning home and crossing a floating bridge when the bridge suddenly collapsed, causing hundreds of people to fall into the river. In the darkness, many who struggled in the water perished. Twenty-four bodies have now been recovered.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 23rd - The police chief of Koblenz has ordered the cessation of all celebrations due to the bridge collapse. President Hindenburg has also suspended his tour of other places and is staying there to participate in the memorial service.</p>
<h3>Earthquake Occurs in Southern Italy</h3>

<h3>French Authorities Prevent Strike Wave</h3>
<p>National Society, Paris, 22nd - After the metalworkers' strike in Lille, France, their leader threatened a general strike on Wednesday. It is now expected that textile workers will join. The authorities have dispatched a large number of police to various suburbs of Lille to prevent conflicts. The current labor unrest was caused by opposition to the wage cuts in the newly promulgated social service regulations. The workers demand that unemployment insurance and medical expenses be borne by the employers, and not, as at present, be deducted from the workers' wages.</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Telegram from Manila to Shen Bao Newspaper, forwarded to the Central Party Headquarters, Party Headquarters in all provinces, organizations, and newspapers: Gao Weiguo, a notorious bandit from Quanzhou, who changed his name to Gao Jingli, is extremely fierce and has been the source of much resentment. However, Lin Shouguo, the naval brigade commander, actually recruited him and obtained recognition from the authorities. The people are already extremely frightened. Recently, he was even ordered to take over the defense of Quanzhou, making a notorious bandit of more than ten years the military and political leader of a county. As a result, the bandit's ferocity has become even more rampant, and the plundering and killing have become even more unbridled. The people's self-defense corps resulted in an unprecedented massacre of the city. Hundreds of innocent people have been killed, and property losses are incalculable. Burning and killing is still continuing. Many overseas Chinese in the Philippines are from Quanzhou. Urgent news reports have caused cries of grief. At today's overseas Chinese conference, public sentiment is agitated. We think that Quanzhou is not an uncivilized area, and the people of Quanzhou are also Chinese citizens. However, the so-called formal naval and marine corps are allowed to wantonly massacre and sacrifice the lives and property of the people. Hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese drifting in foreign countries are constantly worried about not having a home to return to. In addition to telegraphing the government and military authorities to appeal, we ask for assistance. We are extremely hopeful. Chen Yinglai, Li Cuiquan, Yang Kongying, Xue Minlao, of the Presidium of the Overseas Chinese Conference in the Philippines, kowtow.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Will Go to the Front to Supervise the Troops</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Yingqin, Director of the Wuhan Headquarters, took a plane from Hankou to Luohe the other day to discuss operational strategies for the Pinghan Railway line with He Chengjiong, Commander-in-Chief of the Third Army Corps. The plan for attacking Xuchang and Zhengzhou has been largely decided. They then went together to Guide to visit General Chiang. After visiting General Chiang, He Chengjiong immediately returned to Luohe to make arrangements, while He Yingqin went to Bozhou to speak to the besieging armies, and then returned to the front to meet with General Chiang. At six o'clock in the morning on the 22nd, he took a plane back to Hankou from there, with Zhang Yougu, the captain of the First Aviation Team, piloting himself. The plane arrived safely at the Hankou airfield at noon that day. Qian Dajun, He Guoguang, Wu Xingya, Liu Wendao, and other important staff members of the Headquarters came to the airfield to welcome him. After getting off the plane, He Yingqin took a car to the Headquarters and then returned to his private residence to rest. I visited Mr. He at the Headquarters and Mr. He said, "I went to Luohe this time to discuss the plan to attack Xuchang and Zhengzhou with Commander-in-Chief He. After the decision was made, we took a plane to the front together to visit General Chiang and presented everything to General Chiang. General Chiang has adopted this plan and ordered it to be implemented as soon as possible. Commander-in-Chief He then returned to Luohe to make arrangements, while I went to Bozhou to inspect the besieging soldiers, who were extremely brave. Sun Ni's remnants can be completely eliminated. After the inspection, I returned to Hankou from the front. I also took the opportunity to inspect the Pinghan line. The enemy's counterattack on Luo and Yan failed and they retreated in disarray to the north of Linying. There is no trace of the rebel army in the villages around Luobei. When the general attack order is issued again, the entire rebel army on the line can be completely resolved. After returning to Hankou, I will make some arrangements and then go to the front to supervise the troops." (July 22nd)</p>
<h3>Dramatic Increase in Wuhan's Population</h3>
<p>Over 700,000 Refugees Seek Shelter in the Provincial Capital</p>
<p>Soaring Cost of Living Leaves Many Commoners Destitute and Displaced</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: Wuhan's original population of over two million residents, with its numerous factories and flourishing markets, has recently experienced an influx of people due to the Communist bandit troubles in the interior of Hubei Province. Most residents from various counties with even modest assets have relocated to Wuhan to escape the red flames. According to recent household registration statistics from the Municipal Government's Public Security Bureau, the provincial capital's population has increased by over 700,000 in the past few months. Consequently, landlords, seeing the surge in population and shortage of housing, are colluding to manipulate and increase rents. Some are forcing existing tenants to move out, only to re-rent the premises at exorbitant prices. Others are forcibly abandoning the solar calendar, demanding extra rent payments, or hoarding multiple properties for subletting, with individuals becoming "second landlords" and profiting in the process. Residents of Wuhan are in a state of panic, and tenant associations have repeatedly petitioned the provincial government and various provincial and municipal party headquarters, requesting them to direct the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to strictly crack down on these practices to protect the housing of the common people. The Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus recently jointly issued a public notice, stating that they would uniformly crack down on and strictly investigate any increases in rent or the use of the lunar calendar for rent calculation. However, the exorbitant rents remain unchanged, mainly due to the shortage of housing and the overcrowding of people with nowhere to live. As a result, current housing prices are more than double those in Beijing and Shanghai, and the future trend remains uncertain. As for rice, the daily consumption for the Wuhan area is estimated to be around 10,000 *shi* (approximately 1,400,000 kilograms). However, rice-producing regions in Hubei Province are plagued by bandits, and transportation is disrupted. The bulk of the grain supply is currently being transported to Wuhan from Sichuan and Shanghai. However, the daily demand is enormous, and the supply is difficult to secure, leading merchants to hoard and speculate, causing rice prices to skyrocket. Recently, the price per *shi* (approximately 140 *jin*, or 70 kilograms) has reached twenty yuan, with a continued upward trend. For a family of several members, even just the expenses for housing and rice are difficult to manage, not to mention other necessities. The prices of all goods are rising, leading many impoverished people to beg for alms daily, filling the roads and sleeping in the streets. Driven to desperation by the hardships of life, there are daily reports of people committing suicide by drowning themselves in the river. For example, Wu Chengjin, formerly the head of the Shashi Anti-Smoking Bureau and a native of Echeng, who resided in Yanzhishan in Wuchang, recently committed suicide by hanging himself after being unable to make ends meet. Yesterday, he and his wife first threw their two children, aged five and three, into the river, and then hanged themselves. The entire family of four perished, a truly tragic situation.

<h3>Joint Hunan-Jiangxi Campaign to Suppress Huang Gonglue</h3>
<p>Liu Jianxu's Troops Stationed in Western Jiangxi</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: The counties of Pingxiang, Lianhua, Yongxin, and Ninggang in western Jiangxi, bordering Ling, Cha, Li, and You in eastern Hunan, have long been areas where Communist bandits operate. Since last year, the counties of Ninggang and Yongxin have been occupied by bandits led by Yuan Wencai, Wang Zuo, and Liu Zuoshu, plunging the area into darkness. Recently, Huang Gonglue led over 10,000 bandits, equipped with thousands of rifles, mortars, and machine guns, to attack Ji'an from Anfu and Lianhua on the 20th (this was the third such attack). Fortunately, Deng Ying's division defended the city while urgently requesting assistance from Zhang Huizan via telegram. Upon receiving the telegram, Zhang ordered the 52nd Brigade to advance from Xia towards Jishui to provide reinforcements. The combined forces successfully repelled the Huang bandits, and Ji'an was spared from danger. However, the border defense line between Jiangxi and Hunan is too long, and there are too many bandits, making troop allocation difficult. Lu Diping, the commander-in-chief of the Ninth Route Army, believing that the situation in Hunan had been stabilized, specifically requested He Jian via telegram to dispatch troops to western Jiangxi to jointly suppress the Huang bandits. Lu soon received a reply telegram from He Xiaowu, stating that in addition to the one battalion already sent to Jiangxi, another regiment from Liu Jianxu's division would be stationed in Pingxiang to conduct guerrilla warfare, which would further strengthen the defense of Pingxiang. Furthermore, according to news from the Ninth Route Army headquarters, He Jian, in order to eradicate the Communist bandits on the Hunan-Jiangxi border within a specific timeframe, specifically appointed Wei Zhongsu as the commander of bandit suppression in eastern Hunan, coordinating closely with the Ninth Route Army in western Jiangxi. In addition to sending Huang Xingyi and Zhang Huan as representatives to Hunan to discuss all joint suppression plans with Chairman He, Lu and Zhang have also dispatched Deng Weishan, the director of the Municipal Affairs Bureau, as a representative to Pingxiang to transfer to Hunan and liaise with Commander Wei on methods to jointly suppress the Communist bandits in western Jiangxi and to handle coordination matters. Deng departed yesterday. Furthermore, Wang Yinxi, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, departed from the province yesterday to inspect the disaster situation in western Jiangxi and to organize guard teams and local defense in Shanggao, Yifeng, and other counties.

<h3>Chu Lai and Other Counties Launch "Purification of the Countryside"</h3>
<p>Bengbu Communication: In the area of Chu County, Lai'an County, and other counties in northern Anhui, the local people have been suffering greatly in recent months due to the disturbances caused by the bandit Jiang Guochang. Although the police and local militias have repeatedly suppressed the bandits, they return as soon as the troops leave, failing to achieve fundamental eradication. Since the beginning of this month, after Zhang Lisheng, the commander of the Second Cavalry Division, personally supervised the suppression in Chu County, all major bandit gangs in Zilaiqiao, Lao Jiashan, Gaoshanji, and other places have been successively defeated and are almost completely wiped out. Commander Zhang believes that there are still scattered bandit gangs near Chu County and that only by launching a "purification of the countryside" can their roots be completely eradicated. In addition to dispatching troops to pursue and suppress the bandits in coordination with local militia police, he specifically telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Jiang, requesting him to order the Anhui provincial government to instruct the six counties of Chu County, Lai'an County, Quanjiao County, Chuzhou County, Tianchang County, and Dingyuan County to launch the "purification of the countryside" to eliminate the source of bandits and prevent future troubles. Upon receiving the telegram, Jiang immediately instructed Ma Fuxiang, the chairman of the Anhui provincial government, via telegram, to order the six counties of Chu County, Lai'an County, etc., to immediately launch the "purification of the countryside." The Anhui provincial government promptly issued orders for each county to implement the plan. Commander-in-Chief Jiang believes that Zhang Lisheng has been exceptionally effective in suppressing bandits and consolidating the rear in the area of Chu County, and in addition to sending a telegram of commendation, he has also appointed Zhang as the concurrent commander of the Jinpu Railway protection between Pukou and Bengbu. After accepting the appointment, Zhang officially took office in Bengbu and dispatched his chief of staff, Sun Baoyu, to Beijing to seek instructions from headquarters. The Railway Protection Command was formally established yesterday, and its internal organization has been completed. (July 21st)</p>

<h3>The Course of Banditry in Jiande County, Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Jiande County, Zhejiang Province, is a key route on the upper reaches of the Qiantang River. On the 6th of this month, a large band of Communist bandits disturbed the Yangweibu area, 15 *li* from the county seat in the southern countryside. With limited military and police strength to resist, the entire town of Yangweibu was looted, and local gentry Hu Zhiyan, Xie Baohui, and Xie Baochun were brutally murdered. The entire county was shocked. The city only had one company of security guards stationed there, which could only defend itself. Therefore, wealthy households near the city walls fled to Hangzhou. At the same time, Sandu town in the eastern countryside of the county was also burned and looted, and the villages of Licai, Yougao, and Louxia in the southern countryside were also successively burned. After the Second Battalion of the Third Security Regiment arrived, they consulted with the water police to suppress smuggling.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>After jointly encircling and suppressing the bandits, over thirty people were captured, and the bandit momentum was slightly reduced. However, over a hundred bandits were discovered again in Yangxi town in the western countryside, and houses were burned in the Guocun area, 15 *li* away. They also infiltrated the border of Chun'an County, looting the entire town of Chayuan, and their momentum was very strong. Subsequently, Zhu Mingtao, the commander of the Third Regiment of the Security Team, led a team to Jiande to direct the encirclement and suppression. After successively capturing many key criminals, and after a thorough investigation, the ringleaders were executed on the spot, including Tong Yunjiao, the pseudo-deputy commander's sister (in her twenties, she was the bandits' military judge, and the locals who were killed by the bandits were all tried by her), and the Communist father Tong Bichen. The remaining bandits have also been executed. Therefore, the bandit momentum in the county has now calmed down somewhat. However, there are still bandit traces appearing in the border areas of Chun'an, Pujiang, Suian, and other counties near Jiande.</p>
<h3>Liu Jianxu's Proposals for the Aftermath in Southern Hunan</h3>
<p>Changsha Communication: After the remnants of Zhang Guiji's troops fled back to Guangxi, the Fourth Route Army, in addition to dispatching the Li and Chen brigades to Guangxi to pursue them, has redeployed the remaining troops back to Hunan Province, dividing up areas to eradicate and suppress the Communist bandits. However, the twenty-plus counties in southern Hunan border Guangdong and Guangxi, and the people are fiercely independent. After the troops of the Gui and Zhang factions rampaged back and forth, and after several major battles, the local area has suffered greatly. Moreover, there are scattered soldiers and weapons everywhere, and looting is frequently heard. Liu Jianxu, believing that his department is stationed in the area and cannot shirk responsibility, listed four points based on his observations and set out from Hengzhou on the 17th, arriving in the province by car at 1:00 PM. He immediately met with He Jian to explain everything in detail. He praised him greatly and assigned the matters to the Countryside Purification Command and the Department of Civil Affairs for proper handling. The following are Liu Jianxu's proposals: "Commander-in-Chief He Junjian, the counties in southern Hunan border Guangdong and Guangxi, and have always borne the brunt of the campaigns against Gui and Zhang. This time, the remnants ravaged the area, leaving it utterly devastated, with cries of sorrow echoing everywhere, a scene of devastation. I have been stationed here for a long time and am deeply concerned. Seeing this tragic state, I cannot bear to sit idly by. Therefore, I specifically list several points for your inspection and review. Many county magistrates and deputy directors of household defense in southern Hunan have been diligent in their duties, but there are also many who hold sinecures and take advantage of opportunities to support the rebels. People are talking and public opinion is in an uproar. Therefore, I request that careful selection of personnel be made, that the local defense be reorganized, and that those who supported the rebels be punished according to the severity of their offenses. The establishment of area commands was originally intended to consolidate forces for suppression and facilitate command. The method was good and has achieved some success. Now, because the rebel army invaded Hunan, it has been effectively suspended, and the Communist bandits are jumping around, like a fire growing hotter. If we do not take early precautions, the future banditry may be even worse than the current situation in Pingjiang, Liuyang, and Yueyang. Therefore, I request that you issue a clear order to restore the command and set a deadline for the start of suppression efforts. When the rebel army collapsed, many weapons were scattered, resulting in a surge in gun collection, with many names and a lack of unified methods. There are also no standardized orders. As a result, the civilians who possess weapons do not know what to do, so they hide them and do not report them. The personnel collecting weapons engage in various corrupt practices, such as fraud and theft. Even large numbers of weapons are collected and incorporated, but without any effectiveness. The result is that it creates an opportunity for the Communist bandits to lure them, giving tigers wings, which is a terrible potential threat. Therefore, I request that personnel be dispatched to coordinate the suppression and pacification to achieve unification. The people have suffered countless tangible and intangible losses in the areas ravaged by the rebel army. Some have been killed by stray bullets, some have had their houses destroyed, and some have had their entire livelihood destroyed. Those who survived the looting are crying and waiting to be fed. Therefore, I request that personnel be dispatched to investigate and provide relief, especially to those who are in need. The four points above are all urgent tasks for the counties in southern Hunan. I have seen the suffering of the people and dare not conceal it. I have presumptuously submitted this report to appeal on behalf of the people. Please review and make a decision. Respectfully submitted by Liu Jianxu."</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Directs the International Communist Party's Propaganda Plan</h3>
<p>Nine Items Decided at Recent Meeting</p>
<p>Offensive Launched Toward the Northeast</p>
<p>Harbin Communication: Soviet Russia's policy of communist infiltration in the Northeast, according to its planned schedule, has decided to utilize the International Communist Party as its vanguard. The consulates stationed in various locations in the Northeast, supported by the financial resources of the East China Railway and the Far Eastern Bank, are sparing no expense to buy off Chinese, Korean, and Japanese youths for their work. The communist cases that flourished for a time in the Northeast this year are clear evidence of this. Therefore, the authorities are not daring to relax their vigilance in preventing these activities. A radical communist manifesto was recently discovered in the city, and after a thorough search by the police authorities, Yu Ergui, the leader of the communists who was on the run, was arrested. Yu was formerly the principal of the Eighth Middle School and a mainstay of the Communist Party in the Northeast. After being arrested, he was escorted to Liaoning to be tried together with those arrested in Shenyang in the previous case. As a result of Yu's arrest, the Soviet Russian-directed International Communist Party plan, which has already been discussed, has become clear. The International Communist Party recently convened a conference near the capital of Jilin Province. Soviet Russian consulate personnel mostly participated in the discussion. The attending representatives were divided into the Harbin district representative, the Yilan district representative, the Yanji district representative, the Korean Communist Party Manchuria section, the East Manchuria Railway cadre organization committee, the education branch organization committee, the North Manchuria Youth General Alliance representative, and the East Manchuria Youth General Alliance representative. The following matters were decided: (1) The International Communist Party will issue a declaration to participate in the revolutionary movement in order to achieve unified cooperation. (2) The International Communist Party will maintain its previous pace of cooperation and maintain contact with each other. (3) The International Communist Party will implement the destruction of all Japanese facilities and agencies in Manchuria and Mongolia. (4) Act according to plan. All weapons and supplies necessary for assassinations should be obtained from Soviet Russian agencies in the area. (5) In order to understand the state of affairs of each party, a report must be submitted at least once a month to exchange information. (6) For the sake of unified methods, the International Communist Party will implement the education of Soviet Russian citizens and the training of assassination movements after a meeting. (7) The International Communist Party must seek methods to facilitate the conduct of business. (8) The International Communist Party and its affiliated groups must formulate a secret code of identification for their members. (9) The International Communist Party must first point out the crimes of its enemies, destroy them, or create terror by agile methods. (15th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Donghui Charity Association Invites Directors: The directors of the Old Songshu Seven County Charity Association, organized by the Benxian San Shan Hall, have a term of office set at three years. The county magistrate of the location serves as supervisor, and each county magistrate is permitted to recommend appointments. It has been learned that the terms of office of the directors of Songyi County, Chen Zongzhen, Zhu Shijin, Zhang Fusun, and Hu Deliang, have expired, and County Magistrate Jin has prepared a letter to reappoint them for another term.

The county government has sent separate letters to each county to recommend replacements for appointment.</p>
<p>Gunshots in the Dark Night Discovered to Be a Fire Alarm: The military, police, and various agencies in the city suddenly heard several gunshots coming from the southwest last night (22nd) at two o'clock. The garrison immediately deployed troops and stood on the city walls to scout. Zhu Huanbo, the director of the county Public Security Bureau, also sent police to deploy in case of emergency. Later, it was reported that a thatched house belonging to a certain family in Da Zhangjing suddenly caught fire. The thatch and bamboo rafters on the roof had been dried by the intense sun, and once ignited, they crackled loudly.</p>
<p>Re-survey of Disaster-Stricken Cotton Fields: The cotton fields in Tuolin Township have been damaged by hail. There is also damage in the territory of the Second District. The county government commissioned a section member to conduct an on-site inspection. The committee member's reply stated that the disaster-stricken land in Zhangjiabang and Wujiajiu townships in the Second District has been replanted with seeds that have been purchased. The growth of these plants is later than the originally planted ones, and it is difficult to predict the harvest. He then went to Tuolin one, two, three, four and five maps, and found that, due to years of famine, he was unable to purchase seeds for replanting in each area. Most of them were replanted with sweet potatoes and soybeans, which are not as productive as cotton. The losses to rural farmers are particularly dire.</p>
<p>Plotting Prison Escape: The prisoner was sent to the county for questioning: The county prison inmates plotted to escape the night before last but were fortunately discovered by prison official Zhang Zonglie, averting the incident. It was determined that thirty inmates had filed through their shackles in an attempt to escape, all of whom were serious offenders. Prison Official Zhang reported this to the county government for interrogation. It is said that the masterminds were Wang Weishu and others, who had bought and transported files into the prison. It was first discovered by the old inmate Li Shuangxi, who reportedly will be recommended to the High Court for an award. The interrogation of the prisoners has not yet been completed.</p>

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>A Major Prison Break Occurred in Fengcheng: Prison breaks have occurred in this county twice in the past year. After the fact, the only punishment was a paper order to arrest the fugitives and a simple dismissal of the warden as a warning. How to handle the aftermath has never been discussed, so it is only natural that this major prison break has occurred again. It is said that the cause of the disaster occurred at around 4:30 PM yesterday (21st), when more than a dozen serious offenders cut through their shackles and rushed out of the gate. The remaining prisoners saw the opportunity and also shouted and cheered from behind. First, they knocked down the guards, seized their rifles, and fired wildly outwards. They then pulled up the wooden fence and used it as a weapon, fleeing for their lives from the east and south gates. The order was immediately disrupted, and everyone panicked. The police from the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau and the Fourth Squad of the police heard the news and sent teams to pursue and suppress the prisoners. However, the distance between the two sides was already half a kilometer, and the terrain was close to the seawall, with roads branching out. It was difficult to both watch out for them and to encircle them. As a result, twelve people were killed and sixteen were captured. The rest scattered and disappeared. Four residents, including the cake seller A Da, were injured by stray bullets. County Magistrate Shen Qingchen personally went to inspect the scene and ordered squad leader Ding Zhiyan to lead a team to search through the night. According to reliable reports, three more people were captured in the Tangjiao area this morning. In total, forty to fifty prisoners escaped.</p>
<p>Xiaotang Cracked Down on Child Carrying Opium: The Xiaotang Public Security Police Station investigated a rural child over ten years old who was surrounded by local bullies on the street yesterday. They immediately went to stop them. The child suddenly took the opportunity to escape. Because his actions were suspicious, they chased him back and searched him. It was found that he had more than twenty bags of Yu Changchuan opium in his arms. It is said that the opium was entrusted to him by relatives. He has now been sent to the headquarters and transferred to the county for interrogation.</p>
<p>The Calligraphy Exhibition is Opening Soon: The County Second Public Education Hall is launching a calligraphy and painting exhibition in Fengcheng to promote art and cultivate individuality.

<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>Refugees from Pingjiang, Hunan Arrive in the City: Three hundred and eighty male, female, old, and young refugees from Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, arrived from Dongting Mountain, Wuxian County, yesterday afternoon and moored near the Sanjiang Bridge outside the east gate. The Chief Inspector of the County Public Security Bureau, Song Tingyuan, led the police to suppress them. The refugees said that it was late and agreed to leave the border the next morning.</p>
<p>A Sequel to the Arrest of Three Bandits in the City: On the afternoon of the 19th, the county's water police team arrested three bandits, including Wang Jianchang, in the city and sent them to the troops for preliminary interrogation. They confessed that the weapons were hidden in Xigang Fuxiang. On the morning of the 20th, the team escorted the three bandits to Xigang to search, but it was said that the bandits had moved the weapons earlier, so they were not seized.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Details of Arrest of Impersonator of Regiment Commander: Outside the South Gate of Wuxi, in areas such as Shangxia Tang and Chang Street, stores are densely packed and quite bustling. Unexpectedly, at 8:30 PM the other night, a young man in a Zhongshan suit came to the First Police Station of Shangpailou to report, briefly stating that a group of Suzhou wounded soldiers were causing trouble and were coming to Wuxi by waterway, urging them to prepare quickly. The young man also went to various merchants in Nanchang Street to report. Finally, he went to the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau and reported to bureau officer Li Linshi, generally as described above, and presented a name card (reading: Zhu Maoquan, Regiment Commander, 31st Regiment, National Revolutionary Army, Beimentangtou, Wuxi, Jiangsu). He then excused himself and went into the city. When he reached the South Gate, he ordered the guards there to close the city gate. The guards did not comply because they had not received a formal order. Soon after, merchants in the Nanli area closed their businesses early and turned off all the streetlights, creating an atmosphere of panic and alarm. At the same time, County Magistrate Sun Zuji, after receiving the news, immediately led detectives to investigate secretly. The Public Security Bureau also instructed various branches inside and outside the city to be on high alert. Chen Zhanru and Chen Pinsan, standing committee members of the County Chamber of Commerce, also went to Nanli to conduct on-site investigations. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 PM that night, the young man went to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau outside Guangfu Gate and made the same report. Branch Chief Sun and Inspector Qian questioned him in detail. According to the young man, his name was Zhu Maoquan. He came to Wuxi from Suzhou today and went to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau to visit a friend named Xu. He also claimed that a Regiment Commander Zhang would come to Wuxi tonight. "My regiment commander is Zhang; he quit and gave the position to me." When asked about the location and structure of the regiment headquarters, he hesitated and appeared flustered. Sun and Qian, believing that the young man Zhu Maoquan was clearly impersonating a military officer and spreading rumors to confuse the public, immediately arrested him and sent him to the Public Security Bureau. Section Chief Qian Yaonian of the Third Section held a court hearing. Zhu Maoquan confessed that he was nineteen years old, lived in Zhu Lane, Beimentangtou Town. Last year, he was in the business of selling water pumps in Wuxi. Recently, he had been staying home idly. A few days ago, after drinking, he went to the Huadong Printing Company to print military rank cards. He falsely reported to the Third Branch that Suzhou wounded soldiers were robbing people, etc. After hearing the confession, Section Chief Qian believed that Zhu Maoquan dared to impersonate a military officer and spread rumors to confuse the public, which was despicable. He immediately prepared a document and sent him to the county government for legal questioning. Yesterday, Committee Member Tang held a court hearing and ordered his detention pending legal proceedings.</p>
<p>The Levying of Sutra Chanting Donations Has Not Stopped: The County Finance Bureau recently received reports from various district sutra chanting donation collection offices stating that when the people in various districts encounter sutra chanting ceremonies, they often use the excuse that the central government has ordered a halt to the collection of sutra chanting donations as reported in the newspapers and delay payment, resulting in a significant reduction in revenue. However, the bureau has not received a provincial order to stop the collection. Yesterday, it issued a notice stating that until a provincial order is received, the old rules must still be followed and they must not wait and see, which would hinder the special education fund.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Armed Robbery of Opium Case: According to recent news, Li Zaiyang, the squad leader of the third team of the second district of the Jiangsu Water Police Team, cracked the case of Qian A'gen and Yao Shunfu, who used weapons to rob thirty-six dan of opium near Wangting. They were immediately sent to the second district, where District Chief Mao Mujun personally questioned them. Qian A'gen confessed that he was thirty-five years old and worked as a boatman. The opium he was transporting was contracted by my old man, Zhu Youlin, and he gave me 200 yuan for the boat fare. Zhu is now working as the chief detective of the second department of the Shanghai-based Water Police Second District. Yao Shunfu confessed that he was thirty-six years old, from Nanqian, Wuxi. Originally, he was a farmer, but now he runs a tea shop on Nanqian Street, also selling machine-made noodles. On the afternoon of May 23rd, Zhu Youlin came to drink tea and offered to sell me opium. I introduced him to Yao A'tu to buy 213 taels of opium. I paid 435 yuan in silver at that time. Later, I learned that Zhu was the chief detective, etc. It is said that in this case, thirty-six dan of opium were seized. Afterwards, Zhu received seventeen dan, Xiao received one dan, Pockmarked Shuangxi (i.e., Old Master Gu) received one dan, someone received four dan, someone received five dan, and the distribution of the other eight dan is unknown. Xiao originally lived with Zhu outside Guangfu Gate on Dongxin Road. Since this case occurred, they moved to another place, so they are quite involved in this case.</p>

After boarding the boat, they searched and robbed it. Because there were very few passengers, the losses were not great. Afterwards, the South Gate Security Corps heard the alarm and went to investigate, but the thieves had already fled far away. Investigation of the Chengxi Northern Section Project: The Chengxi Road Northern Section project has been repeatedly requisitioned, and work has been intermittent. Much of the earthwork for the entire road has not been completed. Since Mao Feng, Director of the Construction Bureau, took over, he intends to expedite the Chengxi Road project as soon as possible. He specially dispatched technicians to survey the entire road. The results of the inspection showed that the total length of the various sections is forty-three li. Very little had been done before, and most of what had been done had been converted back into farmland. The original roadbed is difficult to identify. In the future, the implementation of the project should still start from scratch. As for the culverts, originally planned for forty-seven, eight of them should be changed to small bridges. Recently, farmers have requested changes for transportation reasons. Yesterday, Director Mao presented the inspection situation to the county for reporting to the Construction Department for processing.</p>

Therefore, the monks of the temple voluntarily opened the flower walls on both sides of the screen wall to create two Western-style gates, and paved a road from Flower Street to reach the water's edge, so that tourists could get on and off the tour boats. On one side, they built five thatched halls in the square for people to rest. Furthermore, they organized a vegetarian restaurant called Gongdelin in the temple.

A prostitute named Hongdi had a brief encounter with Xu. Later, she was taken as a concubine by Liang, kept in a golden house, and already pregnant. Because of his recent unfavorable situation, Liang went out to seek employment a month ago. The prostitute was not tolerated by Liang's first wife, and Mrs. Lu Jin incited her and introduced her to Xu. They had private contacts, and their feelings were quite compatible. Liang suddenly returned the other day. Liang's first wife and Lu Jin spoke of Hongdi's various bad behaviors. Liang was also unable to supply her, so Lu helped her write a deed of divorce. From then on, the prostitute was obtained by Xu and rented a house at No. 17, Sixth Lane, New City. Unexpectedly, Xu had bad intentions and abandoned the prostitute, ignoring her. The prostitute, thinking that Liang had divorced her and Xu had also disappointed her, was unwilling and asked a lawyer named Shang to notify Xu and planned to file a lawsuit in court.

<p>Department of Finance Approves Delay of Penalties in Various Counties: The collection of land tax offset gold in various counties of Zhejiang Province is divided into busy and less busy seasons. If it is not fully paid three months after the start of each busy season, a fine should be imposed. It is now learned that the magistrates of various counties in the province reported that last year, various places suffered heavy disasters and the people's strength was not enough. If penalties were imposed hastily, the people's burden would become heavier and it would be more difficult to collect taxes. Therefore, they have been requesting the Department of Finance to extend the penalty period by one month to alleviate the people's hardship. The Department of Finance has now investigated the situation in various places and confirmed that there are indeed difficulties. It has replied to the counties, approving the extension of the busy season silver and grain payment.</p>

<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Secret Rendezvous Nearly Led to Tragedy of Filicide: Lian Gu, the wife of the deceased Shui Ada, owner of the Zengmao tobacco and paper store in Baiguan Hengjie Bridge, is naturally licentious. Recently, she became familiar with a certain Gu from the local area. The other day, she had a secret rendezvous with Gu at the home of Wang Yanchang, a neighbor on the street, and agreed to continue the pleasure at Pingyang Mountain in the evening. At about 8:00 PM, as she was leaving the store, her seven-year-old second son unexpectedly followed her. The woman was extremely angry and suddenly had malicious intentions. First, she dragged her son and beat him violently. Then, she grabbed him with both hands, waved him around in the air, and finally threw him to the ground, causing the child to faint. Fortunately, several idle guests enjoying the cool air on Pingyang Mountain saw the whole story and intervened. They twisted the woman and her son to Baiguan Street and announced it to the crowd. Fortunately, her son soon woke up, and the crowd released them.</p>

However, five firms, Yichang Heng, Juyunxiang, Xian Tai, and Qian Yifeng, were located at the entrance to the alley and seemed difficult to demolish. They jointly presented a request to the Party Department for an extension. Now, the department, seeing that the deadline has passed and the firms have not demolished, ordered the Chamber of Commerce to order them to fulfill their contracts by a certain date. It is heard that only Juyunxiang has started to demolish its entrance in recent days. The other four firms have again requested an extension of two months. It is heard that the Party has approved the extension until August 15 for completion of the demolition.</p>

He claimed to be surnamed Jin and was going to Putuo to recuperate. The wheel arrived in Ningbo at 6:00 AM the next morning.

However, the wheel had been unable to prevent it. The telegram did not have the name or address of the sender, so it was impossible to reply at that time. Only all the deceased's belongings were temporarily stored, awaiting relatives to come and claim them.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<h3>Letter from the Bengbu Municipal Police Bureau</h3>
<p>Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the Bengbu dispatch in your esteemed newspaper on the 16th, concerning the matter of police officers agitating for back pay, there are slight discrepancies with the facts. We hereby provide a brief account of the origins of this matter and the financial difficulties faced by our bureau, respectfully requesting its publication to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>The Bengbu Municipal Police Bureau has consistently relied on police tax revenue for its regular expenses and maintenance. Each month, there is a shortfall of approximately six thousand dollars, which was typically subsidized by the provincial government. However, since Shi Yousan's army occupied Bengbu last winter, the bureau chiefs appointed by him, Ying Jingzhai and Huang Guangyuan, successively embezzled funds and fled with Shi. As a result, police salaries have been in arrears for four months.</p>
<p>When our current bureau chief took office in February of this year, he witnessed the hardship of the police officers. Furthermore, due to the devastation caused by Shi's army, all industries were in decline, and police tax revenue sharply decreased, exacerbating the police funding shortage. Consequently, he borrowed over three thousand dollars from gentry and merchants in his private capacity to fully disburse February's police salaries. Staff salaries were discounted and advanced. In March, local authorities provided an additional three thousand three hundred dollars, which barely sufficed to issue police salaries.</p>
<p>Subsequently, our bureau chief, unwilling to further burden the local population, refrained from raising funds locally and directly petitioned the provincial government to investigate and allocate monthly subsidies. Despite written appeals and personal requests to the commissioner, there was no outcome. Therefore, for the months of April, May, and June, police salaries were only distributed on a pro rata basis from police tax revenue, with each person receiving an advance of one or two dollars per month to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>Recently, our bureau chief, recognizing that prolonged delays would jeopardize the future of police administration, engaged with the chamber of commerce to seek subsidies. Local figures were also understanding of the difficulties and generously agreed to subsidize three thousand dollars to clear the arrears during his tenure, which has been agreed upon. Our bureau chief, further concerned that the current livelihood of the police officers could not be sustained, arranged for an advance of one dollar per person from June's tax revenue as a gesture of goodwill.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a few off-duty police officers, not understanding the situation, mistakenly believed that the salary disbursement was limited to this amount, and went to the bureau to question the accountant. At the time, the number of participants was only several dozen. After the situation was explained, the police officers maintained order and there was no disturbance.</p>
<p>Our bureau has since cleared all outstanding medical salaries for April, May, and June, and local order is exceptionally stable. The sections in the report that say, "almost caused a disaster" are likely due to misinformation and a lack of clarity on the true situation. This letter is specifically for correction, and we hope for your kind consideration, with utmost gratitude.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Secretariat of the Bengbu Municipal Police Bureau, July 20th</p>

<h3>Measures for Identifying and Prohibiting the Export of Ancient Books</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education drafted instructions on identifying and prohibiting the export of ancient books. Chen Fu, Executive Secretary of the Secretariat, said, "Received your department's letter of the 7th of this month, regarding the Ministry of Finance's request for the approval of a case to ban the export of ancient books, and instructed the ministry to deliberate and respond. Also approved the transfer of the original memorial. After reviewing the various points of the original memorial from the Ministry of Finance, they are indeed essential. In order to facilitate implementation, the Ministry has drafted the 'Instructions for Identifying and Prohibiting the Export of Ancient Books' to facilitate implementation. Enclosing a copy of the instructions, please review, approve, and issue a strict prohibition order, and circulate these instructions for implementation." The original text of the "Instructions for Identifying and Prohibiting the Export of Ancient Books" is as follows: (1) Ancient books prohibited from being exported temporarily include the following types: 1. Thread-bound books or paintings exquisitely printed on woodblocks that meet one of the following conditions: A. Published during the Song, Yuan, or Ming dynasties. B. Various palace editions and fine editions published during the Qing dynasty. C. Editions published more than 50 years ago and whose original printing blocks no longer exist. 2. Yongle Encyclopedia and Siku Quanshu. 3. Archival historical materials. 4. Handwritten manuscripts. 5. Fine-edited versions. (2) Sun Yat-sen's unpublished works and calligraphy are strictly prohibited from being exported. (3) Lithographic, photographic reprints, and seal prints are not subject to the export ban. (4) When identifying the above ancient books, the following procedures should be adopted: 1. For woodblock ancient books, the publication dynasty or year shall prevail. If the dynasty or year is unclear, the year of the preface shall prevail. If the year of the preface is unclear, the years of the author of the preface's life shall prevail. 2. If there are any doubts about the identification of the aforementioned items, the original book must be sent to the Ministry of Education for identification. 3. If there are too many volumes of the ancient books that should be sent, a few volumes may be sampled and sent, or the Ministry of Education may send personnel to identify them.</p>
<h3>Rejection of the Christian Church's Request to Establish Religious Studies Courses</h3>
<p>Fan Dingjiu and other representatives of the Chinese Christian Church submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for permission to allow church schools at all levels to offer elective religious courses and to hold religious ceremonies in primary schools. After receiving the request, the Ministry of Education rejected it yesterday. The original rejection stated, "Received the request and examined the matters mentioned, there are some misunderstandings. Explanations are provided item by item as follows: (1) 'Using religious doctrines to cultivate life' is a valid point, but it should be based on drawing on the spirit of various religions, such as Buddhism's equality and compassion, and Christianity's universal love and helping others... It should not be limited to one religion, nor should it be merely formal. Establishing a specific course limited to one religion and holding religious ceremonies are formalistic and not what educationally means by cultivation. (2) The restrictions on religion in the regulations for private schools are not limited to one religion. If any religion indoctrinates underage junior high school students or younger with doctrines, making them prejudiced by a certain religion, it is tantamount to depriving them of the freedom to choose a religion in the future, which is truly 'shackling the freedom of thought in life.' (3) Since the association, etc., aims at popularizing education and has no intention of using schools to entice or force students to join the church, then the restriction of 'not allowing religious propaganda' does not violate the association's original intention of running schools. As for the claim that the children of over 200,000 Christians must attend church schools, this is also a sectarian view that should not be maintained for long. (4) Education based on science and social reality is what the state approves. Religion is a kind of illusory and缥缈 imagination, not a theory that can be taught, so it is unnecessary to allow its experimentation. In short, religion is not just one religion. Allowing each to compete in religious propaganda under the name of schools will lead to mutual division and inevitable disputes. In order to prevent problems before they arise, the Ministry has no choice but to impose restrictions. This is not just for the Christian religion. The request to establish elective religious courses in junior high schools and to hold religious ceremonies in primary schools is difficult to approve. It is hoped that you will understand the Ministry's subtle intention of restricting religious propaganda in schools and not argue further about this matter."</p>
<h3>Great Dissatisfaction of Students Studying in Japan on Gengzi Indemnity Funds</h3>
<p>Due to unbearable oppression and contempt from the Japanese authorities</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Tokyo Dispatch: Negotiations for the return of China's Gengzi Indemnity funds from Japan have been going on for a long time, but until now, the right to control them has not been successfully obtained and remains in the hands of the Japanese. Among them, more than 300,000 dollars are used to subsidize Chinese students studying in Japan. The order of subsidies is determined according to the qualifications of the schools attended by students in Japan, with different quotas for each province depending on the amount of indemnity borne. The number of people and various situations have been reported in previous news. The Japanese use Gengzi Indemnity funds to subsidize Chinese students in order to buy the favor of Chinese students studying in Japan, to reduce anti-Japanese sentiment, and to avoid accusations of cultural aggression. However, the result is completely the opposite. All students who receive Gengzi Indemnity subsidies hate Japan even more than ordinary students, because the stimulation of oppression is more intense. The right to determine the order of student subsidies rests with the Chinese Student Supervision Office in Japan, and after the office makes a decision, the list is sent to the Eastern Culture Department of the Japanese Ministry of Education, which publishes the subsidy after review. Therefore, the list of students to be subsidized sent by the Supervision Office to the department often encounters problems during the review or is delayed in publication, deliberately creating difficulties. The Chinese Supervision Office can only urge the department and cannot do anything else. For example, female students at Waseda University can be subsidized with Gengzi Indemnity funds in the same order as male students. The Ministry of Education has already issued a clear order to the Supervision Office, and the list has been sent to the department, but due to opposition, it has not yet been published. After the department publishes the list, it notifies the school to which the student to be subsidized belongs. The authorities strictly investigate the ideology, actions, qualifications, and grades of the subsidized students and require them to fill out forms and report back. Only then does the department issue the subsidy, which the subsidized students receive monthly at their school. When receiving the subsidy, the school authorities give a strict lecture, the meaning and content of which are generally the same, with no major differences. The meaning is to absolutely prohibit being pro-Japanese when receiving the subsidy. If there is any anti-Japanese behavior or slight violation of the school's intentions, the subsidy will be immediately cancelled. Under this oppression, Chinese students dare to be angry but dare not speak out. This year, when Senshu University in Japan lectured students receiving subsidies, they said that the Gengzi Indemnity funds were a gift from the Japanese Emperor, and the subsidized students should be grateful to the Emperor. The next season's fees were deducted from the fees received by the students. Such unreasonable words can still come from the mouths of school authorities. The general situation of humiliating Chinese students receiving subsidies can be imagined. (17)</p>
<h3>News of the Ministry of Education's Mandarin Phonetic Symbols Training Class</h3>
<p>Participants from All Sides</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education launched the Mandarin Phonetic Symbols Training Class, party and government organs in Beijing have enthusiastically sent personnel to participate. Those who have already registered include the Secretariat of the Central Political Conference, the Beijing Municipal Party Department, the Garrison Headquarters, the Military Advisory Office, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, various departments and offices of the Capital Construction Committee, the Health, Transportation, and General Staff Departments, and the Anti-Smoking and Mongolian-Tibetan Construction Committees, as well as the Capital Police Department, the Supreme Court, and the Municipal Education Bureau. The number of registered personnel has already exceeded two hundred. There are still several days before the class starts (the 28th), and the number of participants is expected to increase. It is uncertain whether the original number of classes can accommodate everyone. It is reported that major bookstores in Shanghai have recently donated many books on Mandarin Phonetic Symbols to the association, which will be displayed uniformly at the beginning of the class for researchers' reference. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has arranged for Wu Zhihui to give a lecture in person on the opening day.</p>
<h3>Jiang Menglin Goes to Hangzhou to Handle the Handover of Zhejiang University</h3>
<p>Minister of Education Jiang Menglin originally concurrently served as the president of National Zhejiang University. Later, recognizing that he could not divide his time between the duties of the minister and the president of the university, and that it was inappropriate to remotely lead the university for a long time, in order to respect the central government's regulations restricting concurrent positions, he requested the Executive Yuan to forward a request to the National Government to resign from his concurrent position as president of Zhejiang University, and to appoint Shao Peizi as his successor. The National Government has issued an explicit order. Yesterday, Jiang Menglin requested a five-day leave from the Executive Yuan to go to Hangzhou to handle the handover and return to Beijing to devote himself to the work of the ministry.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Schools in Korea Increase Benefits</h3>
<p>Travel by Car and Ship is at the Same Reduced Price as Japanese and Korean Students</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Sinuiju Dispatch: There are quite a few overseas Chinese schools in Korea, the earliest of which was established sixteen years ago, with some having as many as two hundred students. However, the Government-General of Korea has not treated overseas Chinese schools the same as Japanese and Korean schools, such as providing special fare reductions for teachers and students on cars and ships. Overseas Chinese schools have never obtained this benefit. Since Consul-General Zhang Weichen arrived last year, he has negotiated with the Korean governor-general for this right. The Overseas Chinese Primary School in Seoul was the first to be granted permission. Now, the Overseas Chinese Primary School in Incheon is requesting the same treatment by citing the precedent, and an agreement has been reached. Therefore, all travel expenses for teachers and students of the school to travel abroad are now treated the same as those of Japanese schools, which is very gratifying and a new record in the history of overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3>Opening of the Summer Biology Research Association (Shusheng)</h3>
<p>Six-Week Session</p>
<p>Lectures and Sea Collection Held Daily</p>
<p>Xiamen, 17th: Xiamen University and the China Cultural and Educational Foundation are jointly holding a "Summer Biology Research Association" this summer at Xiamen University. The Cultural Foundation is responsible for funding 7,000 yuan, and Xiamen University is responsible for preparation and supplying research institutes and experimental tools. Preparations were completed, and the opening ceremony was held at the Biology Department of Xiamen University at 9:00 am on the 14th of this month. Professors from universities across the country attended, including: Chen Dafu from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou; Hertelmann, Miller, and MacCluer from Lingnan University; Lin Kesheng and Professors Ma and Hou from Peking Union Medical College; Nicholas from Yenching University; Bowling and Hu Jingfu from Yenching University; Lewis and Chen Naxun from Jinling University in Nanjing; Xu Renji and Huang Nong from Jinan University; Zhu Yuanding from St. John's University in Shanghai; Zheng Chengzhang, Chen Xinguo, and Yu Kangrong from Shanghai University; Wu Zhaofa from Soochow University; Mal Xu from Zhijiang University; Liu Chongle from Northeast University in Liaoning; Kellogg from Fukien Christian University; Chen Ziying and Lin Geizhang from Xiamen University; and Futalai from Yinghua College in Gulangyu.</p>
<p>After the opening ceremony, Xiamen University President Dr. Lin Wenqing delivered a welcome speech. Next, Chen Ziying, a member of the Research Association's Preparatory Committee, described the purpose of the Research Association, stating that two biology experts visited Xiamen University last winter and suggested establishing a coastal biology museum to provide biologists with research opportunities. Our President Lin (Wenqing) is also a biologist and highly praised the proposal, and immediately organized a preparatory committee, with me responsible for the experimental aspects of the work. In recent years, Chinese biological sciences have also made significant progress, and many people return from studying in Europe and the United States every year. However, every summer, they go to various coastal biology museums in Europe and the United States for research, while China lacks such opportunities. For a long time, people have proposed building one, but due to various difficulties, it has not been realized. This year's research association is the beginning of the construction of a coastal biology museum. This month, we will see what the interests of the participants are. If there is strong interest, then with everyone working together, the coastal biology museum can be built soon. This is the meaning of this research meeting. The key elements for the establishment of a coastal biology museum are talent and economy, and talent is even more important than economy. You are all domestic biology experts, and with your cooperation, we hope it can become a reality. After the meeting, the work began, and the time was set for six weeks. The procedure is as follows: work will begin on July 14, the first evening lecture will be held at 7:00 pm on the 19th, the first sea collection will be held on the 20th at Nantaiwu, the second evening lecture will be held at 7:00 pm on the 26th, the second sea collection will be held on August 2nd at Gulangyu, a meeting of biology teachers will be held at 7:00 pm on the 9th, a seaside tea party will be held at 6:00 pm on the 15th, the fourth evening lecture will be held at 7:00 pm on the 16th, the third sea collection will be held on the 17th at Jimei and Liuwudian (amphioxus production area), a meeting of the China Coastal Biology Museum will be held at 7:00 pm on the 18th, farewell will be held at 6:00 pm on the 23rd, and the meeting will open on the 24th.</p>
<p>All travel and food expenses for the participating biologists will be provided by the Research Association. This year, the professors will conduct systematic and specialized research on amphioxus, and they will also choose their own research areas.</p>
<h3>Funding for Anhui University Confirmed</h3>
<p>The funding for Anhui University in the 18th year of the Republic was 730,000 yuan. When the provincial government compiled the budget for the 19th year, it was changed to 260,000 yuan and noted that it would be finalized after the new president took office. Now, after the 120th Standing Committee meeting of the provincial government, it was resolved to change the school's funding for the 19th year to 360,000 yuan for regular expenses and 100,000 yuan for temporary expenses, totaling 460,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hubei Education Department Changes the Issuance of Foreign Exchange for Government-Funded Students Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>Changing the Amount of National Currency to the Amount of Foreign Currency</p>
<p>Provincial Government Order Approved</p>
<p>The Hubei Provincial Education Department stated that in the past, all provinces issued national currency for the travel expenses of government-funded students studying abroad in the East and the West. However, international transportation usually uses gold coins from Eastern and Western countries. At a time when gold prices are soaring, if the travel expenses for studying abroad are still calculated according to the original amount of national currency, they will be reduced by more than one-half in disguise. According to the actual situation, this is far from sufficient. Recently, according to the joint request of Chen Li and other government-funded students who were admitted to study in the East and the West this year, the travel expenses for studying abroad should be changed to the currency of the country of study. After verification, it seems appropriate. Therefore, it is proposed to temporarily change the issuance of travel expenses for studying abroad this time to the currency of the country of study and to determine the amount according to the actual situation. A list is also provided below:</p>
<p>Country of Study Original Travel Expenses (National Currency) Proposed Travel Expenses (Foreign Currency)</p>
<p>Japan 100 yuan (National Currency) 60 yen (Japanese Gold)</p>
<p>UK 800 yuan (National Currency) 50 pounds (British Gold)</p>
<p>Belgium 800 yuan (National Currency) 50 pounds (British Gold)</p>
<p>USA 1000 yuan (National Currency) 500 dollars (US Gold)</p>
<p>A document and a table were submitted to the provincial government for review. After the 43rd provincial government meeting, it was resolved to approve the proposal, but only for this time.</p>
<h3>Students of Zhongshan University Go to Beijing to Petition for Funds</h3>
<p>Guangzhou National Zhongshan University, due to its existing school buildings being insufficient and severely damaged, urgently requiring repairs, had its request for 200,000 yuan for repair funds approved by the National Government. Presidents Dai and Zhu of the university, in order to plan for the university's long-term development, designated several thousand acres of land in Shipai, Guangzhou, as the permanent site for the university and submitted a request to the National Government for 2,000,000 yuan in new school building construction funds. These two items of expenditure, which had long been approved by the National Government, have not yet been allocated for a long time, resulting in the university's existing school buildings still unable to be repaired. Therefore, the student union of the university elected representatives Li Weiguang, Chen Xiezhong, Pan Jun and three others to go to Beijing to petition the National Government. The representatives arrived in Beijing on the 21st and went to the National Government on the 22nd to request the prior allocation of 200,000 yuan for repairs and personally delivered a petition.</p>
<h3>Wuxian Education Bureau Adds Public Education Centers</h3>

<h3>The Problem of the Principal of the Fudan University Experimental High School</h3>
<p>A Letter from the Alumni Association to Principal Li</p>
<p>The Fudan Alumni Association is in dispute over the replacement of the principal of the alma mater's Experimental High School. The following is the letter from the association to Principal Li and the members of the Experimental High School:</p>
<p>Dear Principal, Greetings. Today, the alumni association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to discuss the dispute over the principal of the Experimental High School. We carefully reviewed the minutes of the meeting of the faculty and staff of the Experimental High School on June 20, the declaration of Kuai Shixun and others, and the articles of agreement signed by you and the representatives of the Experimental High School in May of the 18th year of the Republic. We know that you designated one of the three candidates elected by the faculty and staff as the principal in accordance with Article 3 of the agreement, which is perfectly legal. We also know that the person who led the declaration was the recorder of the meeting. After repeatedly comparing the declaration and the minutes of the meeting, we found that the declaration only mentioned Articles 1 and 2, while Articles 3 and 4, which stipulate that the principal appoints the principal and hires and fires faculty and staff, were not mentioned at all. Therefore, we suspect that the statements you made as recorded in the minutes of the meeting may not be entirely truthful. They went to great lengths to first seize the principal's decision-making power, and then to bind Principal Chen's will, ensuring that the person they supported would be elected immediately before they could rest assured. They echoed each other, displaying their ability to manipulate the situation. Although we were not present, the situation of being surrounded at the time is vividly depicted on paper. We firmly believe that you will be able to uphold the agreement, exercise your authority, and not be swayed by slander, so as to forever preserve the honor of Fudan University and comfort the hopes of all the alumni. We hope so, we hope so. With respectful greetings, The Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Fudan University Alumni Association</p>

<p>The Meiji University tennis team of Japan bid farewell to the tennis circles in Shanghai on the 22nd and returned home on the Nagasaki Maru amidst the sound of firecrackers. The nine young players of the team played a total of 32 matches in Shanghai, winning 21 and losing 10. In the final match, they drew with the doubles team of Shanghai University. Kanafanlo and Tafers of Shanghai Portugal, and Wheat of South Grassland, etc., are all stars at sea, but they were all defeated by Meiji players, which is the most memorable thing in the team's journey.</p>
<p>The Meiji players can be called second-rate talents in Japan. In Shanghai, except for defeats to Lin Baohua, Jiang Daozhang, and Qiu Fei of the China Tennis Club, they were able to defeat all their strong opponents, which is no easy task. The team is very satisfied with this, it is said.</p>

<h3>A Word of Wisdom by Hai Ke</h3>
<p>Happiness comes from hard work. Misfortune arises from ease and comfort.</p>
<p>The ancients considered it a rare tale that one's eyes may behold courtesans, but the heart holds none.</p>
<p>After reaching the boiling point, love easily unites, but also easily breaks.</p>
<p>If there is no concept of shame between men and women, anything can be done.</p>
<p>If the methods and spirit of seeking love are turned to seeking all careers, success and satisfaction can be easily achieved.</p>
<p>Other things can be done by proxy, but only the work of love must be done in person in everything.</p>
<p>No matter how intimate the friend, there are many heroic acts of commerce and money, but very few large gifts of loved ones.</p>
<p>Eggs must have cracks for flies to swarm. Countries must first be in chaos for foreign insults to follow.</p>
<p>The gun of a military man is sometimes no match for the pen of a scholar. The pen of a scholar is sometimes no match for the money of a rich man.</p>
<h3>A Summer Chat in Luanjiang by Liu Huo'an</h3>
<p>Twelve Fort used to be called Luanjiang, under the jurisdiction of Yizheng County. It is located on the north bank of the Yangtze River, with beautiful scenery and a clear breeze. The mountain scenery across the river is excellent.</p>
<p>Occasionally coming here to escape the summer heat, idly overlooking the river and the sky, although the river air is connected to the city in the morning, it only exists in fantasy. But the setting sun flickers, watching the sand gulls and sails, and the moon surges in the river, sending a clear breeze. The hardworking travelers have forgotten their worries.</p>
<p>Yizheng is the ancient Zhenzhou. In the early Qing Dynasty, there was a bamboo branch poem by Suiyuan that said, "The water passing through Yangzhou becomes clear, and the salt boats are clustered with poles in the bright evening glow. The sound of the river gradually fades, and the sound of the market is near. A small city is prosperous." The scenery of that year can be imagined.</p>
<p>The arts and literature of Yizheng, such as Liu Yong's "Xiao Feng Can Yue" and Bi Yihong's "Human Hell," are all famous works that will last for thousands of years. It cannot be said that it is not the help of the landscape.</p>
<p>After the Taiping Army, salt merchants moved to the fort. Therefore, the fort has the Yangtze Stack as the salt administration agency. When the famous official Kuai Guangdian was in charge of the stack in the late Qing Dynasty, Zhang Zhidong once came and left a couplet for Kuai: "Accumulated snow in spring, flying frost and dew. Washing soldiers on the island, brushing horses in Jiangzhou." The writing is excellent.</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Guild Hall of the fort is the hometown association of salt boats. I have been back and forth for thirty years, and my feelings for my hometown are deep. I once rashly drafted a couplet for the hall: "The marshland blocks the wind and waves. We are happy to help each other through difficulties. Always make salt and plums harmonize the cauldron. The mind embraces the lakes and seas. I hope we can look forward to the future and transform the drifting water into a family home." The salt boats are divided into eighteen gangs, not just one province. Therefore, the second line is like this.</p>
<p>Guazhou is connected to the fort. When I was a child, I studied in the state. I remember a poem I wrote when I passed through again after two years: "The smoke willows used to lie across the 京口岸, and the waves new shake the tavern." There is no lack of emotion about the vicissitudes of life, which is related to my own life.</p>
<p>Teacher Wang Shaorong died in the state. I wrote a eulogy: "The scholar's heart is eternal, feeling deeply knowing himself. The Yangtze River is one river of water, tears sharing sadness." Tears and ink flow together, is it not the true meaning? (But return)</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Sheng Shengchuan by Wu Tingchen</h3>
<p>Mr. Sheng Shengchuan, personal name Bingwei, was from Zhenhai County, Zhejiang Province. He was from a distinguished family and passed the imperial examinations early. He successively served as the education commissioner of Sichuan and Jiangxi provinces. After retiring, he advocated public welfare and encouraged younger generations. He had many students, and his descendants were thriving. He was truly a remnant of the former dynasty and a man of the Republic of China. The Sheng family and my family have been friends for generations. Mr. Sheng was also a classmate and close friend of my late father, Hu Qinggong. I have repeatedly thought of visiting the elder, but I often failed because of my work at the newspaper and sleeping late. Last winter, at the funeral of my brother-in-law, Wang Haifan, I also went to mourn. Mr. Sheng happened to be present. I asked my friend Sheng Lansheng to introduce me. After paying my respects, I received much teaching. This spring, I met him again at the home of my brother He Caitang. The next day, I sent a card to visit him, but Mr. Sheng was out on official business. I thought there would be a chance to see him soon, but unexpectedly, Mr. Sheng returned to the Dao Mountain this summer. His dignified appearance is still before my eyes, but his elegant transformation can only be kept in my heart forever. The eulogy is as follows:</p>
<p>Remembering that Mr. and my late father were classmates, they were old friends.</p>
<h3>Kneeling Wine by Hui Ling</h3>
<p>Mr. Gan Bisheng, styled Bigong, was a famous scholar from Lingnan. He was addicted to chanting poetry and good at drinking. He once poured a full cup of wine at the Liaoshe Poetry Gathering and offered it to the guests, kneeling on the ground to encourage them to drink. Some of the members who could not hold their liquor were all drunk. On the spot, they used "kneeling wine" as the theme and each recited two quatrains. Bigong's poem said, "Why not drink ten cups at once? Pour three more buckets to help the madness. It has always been difficult to bend this knee, not to worship Fenyang, but to worship Ruyang." The demeanor of a famous scholar, letting his heart go freely, is also a good story in the literary world.</p>
<p>Yue descended from the gods, admiring the honored one together. My father's friend followed him from a young age, but never entered the gate to see the beauty and wealth.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you allowed my friend to speak his mind. Since last winter, the Dou Mountain has been in sight, and we have repeatedly received instruction. Why did the wise man wither so suddenly? The fall of the Liangmu is mourned.</p>
<h3>The Grand Situation of the National Goods Department Store by Xinsheng</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the National Goods Department Store on Nanjing Road last Saturday, the atmosphere has been very good. From 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., buyers have flocked to the store, and each counter has been too busy to handle them all. Because the products are sold directly by the factories, they are priced at wholesale prices. Therefore, they are often more than half the price of imported goods. Most buyers are satisfied. All household necessities, as well as all clothing, food, and utensils, can be found in the store. From this, it can be seen that Chinese people do not need to buy imported goods, and the low price and beauty of Chinese products are actually better than any foreign goods. The decoration of the storefronts is all different and vying for novelty, which is dazzling. The Invincible Brand Department Store is located in a remote corner on the left side of the hall. Its front is obscured by the huge curtain of the Dahua Iron Factory, and the roads on the left and right are also covered by the over-the-street signs of other companies. It should not be visible to the public. However, because of its novel layout, using electric light butterflies to reflect the light through overlapping glass mirrors, it can attract people's attention. Therefore, its business is particularly prosperous. The number of invoices used every day is probably the highest in the company. The reporter has two feelings about this. (1) It is not that Chinese people do not like to use Chinese goods. The phenomenon of the National Goods Department Store is enough to see the psychology of the Chinese people. (2) Sincere and Wing On have also been established for many years. Will the National Goods Department Store necessarily be a flash in the pan? Then, starting from this, to achieve great success, we should wait and see.</p>
<h3>The Bai Ying Incident and the Romantic Woman Shao Xie</h3>
<p>The Bai Ying incident has become the central topic of discussion in Shanghai society recently. Judging by reason, Bai is indeed a pitiful young woman, and it is the evil environment of society that drives her to this. According to a friend, last summer, when Bai was studying at Fudan University, she often went to Room 39 of the male dormitory to chat. She spoke without restraint and did not act like an ordinary young woman. Bai said, "Men are slaves to women," which is extremely insightful. Later, Bai entered the dance hall and once told her former classmate about her life, saying, "I am now a dancer and can earn three or four hundred yuan a month. In today's society, those who are forced to live in hardship are everywhere. I can also be satisfied." Her meaning was full of emotion. Who would have thought that after a year, it would eventually lead to today's change? Some say that Ms. Bai has a very deep intellect, but she cannot make good use of her emotions, and her actions are romantic, leading to bad consequences.</p>
<p>In general, romantic habits are not necessarily innate, but must be created by the environment. Bai Ying is a good example. A month ago, Ms. Xuan Jinglin produced a film called "Romantic Woman" for the Star Film Company. Although the narrative is not the same as Bai Ying's experience, the depiction of the life of a romantic woman is similar to the Bai Ying incident in all aspects of schools, dance halls, and society. The film tells the story of a young woman who is driven by the environment to fall. The plot is very tortuous, and the background is Shanghai society, with all kinds of monsters and strange things. The film is intended to shock the world. When it is released in the future, those who care about the Bai Ying incident can go and watch it to compare and verify it. They will suddenly realize the evil of society and the difficulty of women to be independent.</p>
<h3>The Use of Old Newspapers by Lü Bing</h3>
<p>If old newspapers can be accumulated completely, they can be sorted and bound for reference. However, people in society, once</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Records of Gatherings (1)</h3>
<p>"Bi Hui" is the name we give to PEN in Chinese translation. PEN is an association of writers initiated in London in 1921 by Mrs. DAWSON SCOTI. But in these few years, it has expanded into an international writers' association. Currently, there are thirty-three participating countries. More than forty cities have established branches, from Oslo to Rome, New York to San Francisco, London to Riga and Helsinki, from Montreal to Buenos Aires, from Geneva to South Africa. Now, with the addition of China, the location of this PEN association has spread across the globe like a spider web. The writers included are poets, playwrights, editors, essayists, and novelists. Broadly speaking, anyone who uses writing as a profession and has achieved a considerable position is eligible to be elected to the association.</p>
<p>The original intention of this association was to provide an opportunity for literary writers in and visiting London to gather and socialize. Its only activity was a monthly dinner. But soon it discovered that there were more things to do than just that. Although it was initially declared that it would not involve politics or any propaganda, this principle is still adhered to today. Its first achievement in Europe was to break down international political boundaries. Before the aftermath of the European war had subsided, German and Austrian writers had already met with writers from the Allied countries through the mediation of PEN. The most significant benefit for a PEN member is that a writer who becomes a member of one branch simultaneously acquires membership of branches all over the world. Therefore, they can enjoy various conveniences when traveling abroad and can get to know literary writers in other countries through the introduction and mediation of various branches.</p>
<p>But PEN also has its greater tasks and greater purposes. Several important resolutions were passed at the annual meeting held in Beijing. 1. Although the origin of literature varies by country, literature itself knows no national boundaries. International or political disputes are inevitable, but literary works should continue to circulate freely between countries.</p>
<p>2. Under any circumstances, especially during wartime, artistic works, being the common property of mankind, should not be subject to destruction by political or national passions.</p>
<p>3. PEN members should use their influence to achieve mutual understanding and respect between nations.</p>
<p>Browsing, often discarding them. Much waste can be utilized; why not old newspapers? Therefore, I offer several points to substantiate this discussion.</p>
<p>Ordinary households often bundle and sell their read newspapers, and the small amount earned per pound is a minor supplement. These newspapers are then resold by vendors to various stalls, where they are used to wrap candies and peanuts, saving costs and providing convenience. This is certainly one way of utilizing them.</p>
<p>When drying clothes in the summer and storing them, if old newspapers are used as lining, it can prevent moths from eating them. Its effectiveness is even greater than that of camphor. This is because the ink used to print on newspapers retains its smell, which is enough to make moths disappear.</p>
<p>Utensils stained by soot and bowls and dishes covered in grease are difficult to wash. Simply wipe them with old newspapers, and they can become clean immediately. After emptying a garbage can, burn some old newspapers inside to keep the can dry and prevent grease from sticking to the walls. This achieves two benefits in one go.</p>
<p>The mattress on an iron bed often develops vertical and horizontal rust stains on its underside due to being pressed upon during sleep. It is difficult to remove these stains. Therefore, several sheets of old newspaper should be laid flat as a barrier to maintain cleanliness and prevent rust.</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence (63) by Liu Haisu</h3>
<p>The French Autumn Salon</p>
<p>(4) A Bird's-Eye View of the 1929 Works (1)</p>
<p>The notice for the Autumn Salon has arrived. It was addressed to MONSIEUR BAI. It was exactly 3:30 PM on October 20th, just as I returned from the Louvre.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Your work has been selected. Please come to the venue at 3:00 PM on October 30th to arrange your work. Attached are two invitation tickets and one long-term ticket.</p>
<p>Chairman Xia Deng</p>
<p>This was printed in French on white paper. After we sent the work at the end of September, we didn't have much hope. We had already dismissed the matter. Now, to be selected, it was beyond my expectations.</p>
<p>The afternoon of October 30th was a clear day. We came out of the Louvre, passed through the Tuileries Garden, the Place de la Concorde, and between the Champs-Élysées and the banks of the Seine. Before me stood a magnificent and towering building. When I first arrived in Paris, every time I saw it, I was always amazed. This is a famous historical building in France called the Grand Palais. Above dozens of stone steps, huge sculptures stood side by side, creating a solemn and simple atmosphere that commands respect. This is the entrance to the Autumn Salon.</p>
<p>The Grand Palais is also the old French royal palace. Since 1673, various salons of different eras have been held here. It is a place for people from all countries to appreciate art. The great masters of art from the 18th century onwards in Europe have probably all come here and displayed their works. This alone is enough for us to imagine the glorious history of such a magnificent building. Entering the palace, although crowded, it was very solemn and emitted a deep and rich atmosphere. We bought a "catalog" to follow the map and look at the works one by one. Before I came to the country, I roughly knew the outline of the Autumn Salon. This was the first time I personally saw the Autumn Salon. We first looked at the paintings, going upstairs from the west side. In a larger room at the top of the escalator, we immediately saw a portrait by LATIRON. Four black men were sitting and lying on the beach, talking. The ink-black skin contrasted with the yellow sand and the azure sea. It was a clever and keen stimulus, a kind of lush and beautiful feeling. A morning scene of Notre Dame de Paris. Another nude figure, as white as snow, with lips painted red. This was a Japanese work. Over there, three or four paintings of the lives of Africans were hung. The skin like Coca-Cola, matched with the shady green of the trees, was another kind of lush flavor. Now Matisse has also made a pilgrimage to Tahiti in Fiji. He is looking for the fragrance of Coca-Cola-colored flesh, or the oily green banana trees, and the bright yellow sand. He wanted to discover the true nature of culture and open up new paths in art in a completely barbaric land. I think his future works will definitely have a more strange and vigorous development in color. The first person to paint black people was Monet in his "Olympia." But the most courageous and soulful person who specialized in painting black people and opened up a new artistic sense was Gauguin. Gauguin was indeed vilified for his love of black people. He eventually died on a savage island. Now there are many painters who like to paint black people in Tahiti. This lush flavor has become so common that modern people have become accustomed to it and can no longer produce any different kind of stimulation.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Increasingly Weak</h3>
<p>Fell Another Four Taels Yesterday</p>
<p>Breaking the Ninety-Tael Barrier</p>
<p>Impact of Japanese Political Turmoil</p>
<p>Sluggish Trend and Weary Market Conditions Yesterday, the gold price continued its downward trend. The morning market was relatively stable, but the afternoon market was particularly weak. However, there were no significant fluctuations, only rises and falls of one or two taels. The trend was sluggish, and sentiment was weak. Throughout the day, there was a difference of about seven taels. There were no drastic changes in foreign exchange rates, and quotations remained unchanged. Selling pressure remained strong in the market, with firms such as Da De Cheng and Yuan Sheng selling. Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, Shun Li, and Yuan Mao Yong traded intermittently. The buying side was mainly retail customers. The morning market was mediocre, with a slight rise in the silver market, hinting at a potential upward trend around ninety-two or ninety-three taels. In the afternoon, Yuan Cheng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Tai Kang Run, and Cheng Feng Yong all sold, while Zhi Feng Yong and Yu Xing Yong bought slightly. The market was quite weak, mainly due to the turmoil in Japanese domestic politics and the reduction of military spending, which triggered general fear and caused prices to plummet by four or five taels, abruptly breaking the five hundred and ninety-tael barrier. However, the gold market unexpectedly turned weak due to the closure of the foreign exchange market on Wednesday. Yesterday, the silver market rose by one-sixteenth, and the U.S. silver price rose by one-eighth.</p>
<p>The Morning Market Was Mediocre, and the Decline Was Slow. The opening price for September was five hundred and ninety-four taels and six mace, an increase of six mace. Subsequently, there were fluctuations of one or two taels, with Yuan Cheng selling and Yuan Cheng Yong buying. When the first order was announced, the quotation remained unchanged at around ninety-four taels. The domestic market was stable, and the wheat firm offered U.S. dollars for August at thirty-seven yuan and bought shillings at six pence two-five, causing the price to rise to ninety-four taels and seven mace. Then, it went downstream due to sales by MacGregor, English gold for October at three seventy-five, September at three one two five, and also by Yuan Cheng and arbitrageurs. After 10 o'clock, it was ninety-one taels and seven mace. Subsequently, there was a slight improvement, and buyers were constantly on the floor, pushing the price up two taels to ninety-three taels and a half at 11:15. Mitsui absorbed October shillings at six pence four three seven five, slightly less than a few cents. Arbitrageurs sold, while Wan Xing and Shun Li bought, resulting in fluctuations of four or five cents. The market closed at noon at ninety-two taels and nine mace, with the revealed price still calculated at six hundred and fifty-two taels and two mace, a small difference of fifty-seven or fifty-eight taels. The noon close was between sixty taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Close at Ninety Taels. The market opened in the afternoon at ninety-one taels and seven mace, then at one tael and four mace. Sellers were active, and the price was subsequently raised by about two taels to ninety-two taels and four or five mace. It was heard that a small amount of Indian remittances was sold. After that, selling pressure increased, with Heng Xing, Yuan Cheng Yong, and Da De Cheng all competing to sell, causing a drop of three taels to eighty-nine taels after 2:30, breaking the ninety-tael barrier. This was due to weak sentiment and negative atmosphere. After a while, retail customers bought, adding one tael. After 3 o'clock, it was ninety taels and zero two three mace. Sales by Dalian Gang and merchandise caused a sudden drop of more than two taels, and the market was quite weak. At 3:45, it suddenly fell to eighty-seven taels and eight mace. After 4 o'clock, it suddenly jumped up by more than two taels to ninety taels and zero three mace, while Heng Xing's buying and selling were uncertain for unknown reasons. The market closed at 4:30 at ninety taels, a decrease of four taels compared to the previous day. The highest price during the day was ninety-four taels and seven mace, and the lowest was eighty-seven taels and eight mace, a difference of six taels and nine mace. Therefore, there were dual closing prices for the morning and afternoon. The morning price for August was ninety-two taels, and for September, ninety-three taels. The afternoon price was eighty-seven taels to eighty-eight taels. July was already settled, so it was not included. The makeup water was ninety-two taels in the morning and eighty-seven taels in the afternoon. The price of merchandise was four taels and four mace in the morning, two taels and six mace at noon, one tael and six mace in the afternoon, and the closing price was ninety taels.</p>
<p>Selling Pressure Was Strong in the Market. Trading by various firms included Yuan Xing Yong, Yuan Mao, Heng Xing, and Shen Yu all buying. Shun Li, Yuan Cheng Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Jin Da Yong, Yu Da, etc., traded intermittently. Da De Cheng, Yuan Cheng, Yong Cheng Chang, Fu Chang, Sen Chang Yong, and arbitrageurs all sold. In the afternoon, Zhi Feng Yong, Yu Xing Yong, and Fu Yu bought. Da Kang Run, Da De Cheng, Yuan Cheng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, and Cheng Feng Yong all sold. Heng Xing, Shun Li, Wan Xing, etc., bought and sold occasionally. Dalian Gang bought a total of more than 700 bars and sold more than 600 bars, with no large transactions due to disagreements among arbitrageurs. Guang Gang bought slightly in the morning and traded uncertainly in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's quotations showed no changes in foreign exchange rates. The internal market of banks was also generally peaceful. However, both the British and U.S. exchange rates seemed loose, while the Japanese exchange rate was stable. The gold market was flat in the morning and weak in the afternoon, breaking the five hundred and ninety-tael barrier due to a negative atmosphere and strong selling pressure, causing public anxiety. There were no large transactions in various foreign exchange markets, and the market situation was almost stagnant. Chinese merchants sold 100,000 pounds of British gold, and the wheat firm also sold tens of thousands of pounds. More than 100,000 yuan of U.S. dollars were traded. The wheat firm and Mitsui sold, while Zhejiang Industrial bought. Japanese exchange rates saw limited buying and selling by gold companies. Banks such as the Korean Bank bought, while Taiwan sold slightly. Since it was Wednesday in the afternoon, there was no market. The noon closing price was similar to the 22nd for English gold, slightly higher for U.S. dollars by zero six two five, and higher for Japanese gold by two five. The market atmosphere remained mediocre. English Exchange Rate: The internal market fluctuated by only zero six two five. In the morning, the buying price for July and August was one shilling and six pence two five, and the buying price was three one two five. The buying price for September was three one two five, and for October, three seven five. The noon closing was stable.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Calm and Unchanged</h3>
<p>The yarn market was calm and unchanged, with many taking a wait-and-see attitude. Fluctuations were limited to within one or two taels. However, the situation for this month remains good, as sales of 10-count blended yarn are strong, and Guangbang is holding tight. Distant months are weaker due to poor raw cotton conditions.</p>
<p>The Evening Market Sees Some Short Covering: At the opening of the public auction, the U.S. cotton price was stable, but sentiment remained weak. However, there was a lack of sellers, so the market did not change. There were still many empty boards, with each month fluctuating by one or two qian. In the afternoon, there was some short covering, with each month rebounding by one, two, three, or four qian. The total trading volume for the day was 2,950 bales. It was found that Shen Ji Yi Chang Rong Xing sold between 150 and 450 bales, while Yi Yu Da Feng Heng Yi Tai Chang bought between 100 and 200 bales.

<h3>Cotton Market Relatively Stable</h3>
<p>The cotton market was slightly stable, but most people still expect prices to rise. However, foreign cotton was stable, causing the market to quiet down slightly. Some manufacturers bought several thousand dans for the near months and sold several thousand dans for the distant months, resulting in near-term firmness and distant-term weakness. Future trends will depend on the movement of U.S. cotton.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Buy Near, Sell Distant: The opening price for Han Standard was still high. Because U.S. cotton was stable, retail investors covered their short positions, with near-term prices rising by two qian and five fen and distant-term prices remaining flat. In the afternoon, Mei Ji switched positions in large quantities, resulting in flat near-term prices and distant-term prices falling by five fen. The total trading volume for the day was 33,900 dans.

<h3>Overseas Cotton Yarn: More Weak Than Strong</h3>
<p>American Cotton Fluctuates: Yesterday, American cotton prices fluctuated due to lack of rain in the drought areas and good weather forecasts in the West. Futures prices rose or fell by 1 to 15 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 10 points. Indian cotton weakened due to poor Liverpool market prices, with Pingor falling 5 rupees, forward contracts falling 4 rupees, Oomra falling 3 rupees, forward contracts falling 2 rupees, and White Broach near and far futures falling 4 rupees.

<h3>Overview of Cotton Crops in Hubei</h3>
<p>Best Growth Around Laohekou</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of new cotton in Hubei this year, it is reported that the sowing season this year had more rainfall, about three weeks later than in previous years. The growth situation is as follows: (1) Around Laohekou (Laohekou, Xinye, Zaoyang, Fancheng, Guangshui, etc.), the cotton seedlings had sufficient rainfall, developed well, and the early-planted ones were already over a foot tall. The area suffered less from banditry, and cultivation progressed smoothly. The first weeding work has been completed, and it is predicted that the cotton harvest here is most promising. (2) In the middle reaches of the Han River, such as Shayang, Qianjiang, and Tianmen, there was excessive rainfall, and cultivation was delayed due to banditry. The first weeding has not been completed in half the area, resulting in abundant weeds and poor cotton seedling development. (3) In the Shashi area, there was also excessive rainfall, and part of Jianli was flooded. Furthermore, due to banditry, cultivation was difficult to start, and the cotton seedlings developed slowly, only four or five inches long. The prediction is pessimistic. (4) Along the Pinghan Railway, such as Sancha Bu, Xiaogan, and Yunmeng, development was also slow due to delayed sowing, but the rainfall was moderate, and the situation was quite good. (5) In Caidian Jiaxiang and other places, there was too much rainfall, affecting cultivation, and the development of cotton seedlings was also poor.</p>
<h3>Grain: Northern Japonica Rice Continues to Fall, New Japonica Rice Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, few inland boats arrived at Zhabei, about ten or so. However, the sluggish sales were rare. A small number of northern top-grade japonica rice were still inquired about, but secondary grades were ignored, and the downward trend became more severe, falling a further four jiao compared to the previous day. In total, ordinary japonica rice has fallen by one yuan and three or four jiao within three days, reflecting the sharp drop in inland production prices and active shipments to Shanghai. Since the launch of Dongxin rice in this port, market sentiment has softened significantly, and rice mills are also selling off large quantities of rice in stock. Foreign rice is also falling sharply, creating today's trend, which is a reaction to the large price increase. The volume of Dongxin rice is not strong, remaining only over a hundred dan, so the market remains stable, still at 21 yuan. The situation for Yangxian and Duxian rice remains weak. Observers here believe that goods at 17.5 yuan can be considered ordinary high-quality goods, so the price has dropped significantly. In the afternoon, according to the association's news, foreign rice had shown a firming trend, so the market felt slightly stable. There is very little Xian rice here, with no transactions. Baiyuan high-grade rice is stable, while secondary grades are weak, and sales are not very good, causing the overall market to be sluggish. Trading was very dull here all day, due to the lack of development in the Hujiao market.</p>
<p>The total number of boats arriving at the river docks in Shanghai South was about ten. The market sales in this street are the same as in Zhabei, extremely sluggish. Machine-milled rice, such as special top-quality goods, remains stable, but if goods are slightly below standard, the price cuts are too large, so the market price is another two jiao lower than the previous day's market. The market situation can be described as deteriorating. A small amount of Dongxin rice has been seen, and the sales path is still acceptable, with the price still at 21 yuan. Thin rice boats have been seen arriving, but the sales market is not strong. Stores only selectively purchase high-quality rice, while consumption at meals is even more sluggish. Top-quality goods opened between 20 yuan and 5 or 6 jiao. The situation for Yangdu and Jian rice continues to be weak. Large quantities will be arriving soon, so the future trend is feared to be even weaker. General goods sales are not good, and inventory is gradually increasing, causing the market to soften and trading to be light. The price is down a small amount.</p>
<h3>Imported Brown Rice: Price Rises Then Falls Again</h3>
<p>Sluggish Sales Make It Difficult to Maintain Position... Down Four or Five Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market was stable in the morning. Although trading was light, the market price showed signs of improvement, continuing the recovery from the previous afternoon. However, after the high price, actual sales were completely stagnant. Small rice shops and inland retailers in this street also only slightly handled white Xian rice. High-quality small pattern brown rice initially opened at 11.3 yuan, but sales stalled and the price immediately fell. Even floating buyers were scared off. Ordinary goods opened at 11 yuan, and in the afternoon, the price dropped slightly to 10.5 yuan, which was also 4 or 5 jiao lower than the final market price of the previous day. Saigon rice, small grain white rice, and large grain white rice were still sold by small rice shops and retailers, and the decline was slower, down one jiao to three jiao. In total, one boat of Saigon rice, 400 bags, was traded at a price of 16.9 yuan, 2,000 bags of small grain white rice at a price of 14.45 yuan to 13.9 yuan, 1,600 bags of large grain white rice at a price of 11.9 yuan to 7 jiao, and 2,500 bags of small grain brown rice at a price of 11.3 yuan, 11 yuan, and 10.95 yuan to 2 yuan and 5 jiao, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Recovers, Especially Strong in the Near Term</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of all months showed signs of recovery, especially the rebound in the current month was even more impressive. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat recovered by two or three jiao, and although the standard for the current month was previously the weakest due to abundant spot goods and soft market sentiment, the situation changed dramatically yesterday. It was heard that certain firms were planning to purchase tens of thousands of cars of the current month's standard, causing market sentiment to rise sharply. General short sellers rushed to cover their previous sharp losses, resulting in a sharp rise. The market sentiment for forward months also showed signs of improvement due to the scarcity of sellers. As a result, the current month rebounded by 1 qian 2 fen compared to the previous day, the August/September months rose by 3 fen, the September month rose by 4 fen, the November month rose by 2 fen, and the December month rose by 5 fen. Spot wheat prices also rose sharply due to the sharp rebound in the standard, so various grades also shouted up by 5 or 6 fen. However, manufacturers were not eager to purchase, resulting in rare transactions. It is estimated that a total of over 2,000 bags of wheat from Hankou, Shashi, and Puzhen were purchased by manufacturers, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour Market: Strong in the Near Term, Weak in the Far Term</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of all months showed a pattern of being strong in the near term and weak in the far term. In the current month, the market sentiment was suddenly strong because northern firms were actively purchasing, and manufacturers were also purchasing in the market due to insufficient flour in stock. Therefore, the highest price returned to 2 taels 4 qian 4 fen. Forward months also rose by one or two fen at the same time. However, in subsequent sessions, the current month remained firm, while the forward months continued to be sluggish because northern firms continued to sell, and manufacturers did not rise to cover their positions. Therefore, the situation gradually became sluggish. Observing the subsequent movement, it is possible that the market may stabilize here because manufacturers are unwilling to deliver goods. The results were that the current month was better by 7 li and a half compared to the previous day, the August month was unchanged, the September month was better by 2 li and a half, the October/November months were down by 5 li, and the December month was down by 7 li and a half, it is said.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Futures Suddenly Rise by Four and a Half Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the standard soybean cake futures market situation was suddenly good. In the morning, the prices of all sessions saw a tight increase of about 2 fen. Subsequently, due to smooth spot sales and purchases by buyers, short sellers covered their positions, and market sentiment became tight. After the opening in the afternoon, buyers were even more active, so the market price rose by another 2 fen. As a result, the next term of July rose by as much as 4 fen compared to the previous day, opening at 1 tael 9 qian 5 fen and a half. The situation was very good.</p>
<h3>Sericulture: Autumn Silkworm Rearing in Various Prefectures of Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Most of the Recent Hatchings Are Improved Breeds...Rearing Volume Increases Sharply</p>
<p>The silkworm cocoon harvests in the spring and summer seasons this year in various prefectures of Guangdong Province were poor. Government offices and silk merchants are making every effort to promote autumn silkworm rearing, pre-ordering large quantities of improved breeds and distributing them to farmers to rear. Currently, silkworm farmers in Shunde, Nanhai, Daliang, Rongqi, and other places are starting to hatch silkworm eggs. Most of the current rearing is of improved breeds, and the rearing volume has increased sharply. Mulberry leaves in the fields are also very lush, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Zhenmei Tea Has Already Seen Activity</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the tea market in this port, foreign firms began to handle Zhenmei green tea from Lailu tea estates. British firms such as Xiehe, Jinlong, and Tianxiang were all active. High-end core-picked goods from Wuyuan tea estates opened at 230 taels, but the quantities were small and did not affect the overall situation. Tunxi Zhenmei tea already saw over a thousand boxes traded yesterday, with prices ranging from 95 taels to 100 taels. Gongxi green tea from the Russian Cooperative Association opened yesterday, with prices ranging from 50 taels to 53 taels, which was 10 taels lower than last year. Furthermore, the current intention to purchase is not strong. Most tea merchants are still reluctant to sell due to cost considerations, it is said.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: New Glutinous Rice Branch: Poor Harvest, High Price</h3>
<p>The harvest of new glutinous rice branches this year is poorer than last year, and the quality of the products is also inferior. However, due to the scarcity of the quantity, the market price has risen instead. The first batch has already arrived. Yesterday, the market price opened at 84 taels, with miscellaneous brands slightly lower. The remaining Jinshan branches have also continued to arrive, and the quality of the bodies has mostly softened. Top-grade yuan branches are around 27 taels, secondary grade around 24 or 5 taels, and flat branches around 28 or 9 taels. The market is stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand White Shouted Up to 8 Taels 1 Qian</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegrams: Cuban spot sugar rose slightly by 3125, with a price of 1.28125. New York sugar futures: September price 1.21, up 2 fen; December 1.31, up 3 fen; March next year 1.40; May 1.48, also up 2 fen each. Javanese spot sugar price 8.9375, no rise or fall. Sugar futures: August price 8.625; September 8.50, up 125 each. The Association's coarse sand white market sentiment is even stronger, with shouting prices as high as 8 taels 1 qian, but transactions are very quiet. The final result was 8 taels and 5 fen, with slight transactions, and both buying and selling were sluggish. The market remained strong. 20th grade medium sand white was 7 taels 9 qian, and 12th grade Dutch red was 7 taels 1 qian. The markets were all firm. Japanese sugar YRO mark was 7 taels 9 qian and 2.5 fen, YT mark was 5 taels and 5 fen, and YP mark was 8 taels 2 qian and 7.5 fen. Transactions were sparse, and the market was flat and sluggish. The Huaxin Company sold Dutch sugar for dumping. 8th grade Dutch red price was 4 yuan 9 jiao and a half, and 10th grade was 5 yuan 1 jiao and a half. It was heard that each grade opened at 200 or 300 tons, and the market sentiment was quite strong, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hardware: French and Western Nails See Another Price Increase</h3>
<p>French and Western nails showed another lively scene yesterday. Firms from Tianjin and other places rushed to purchase, and firms from Fujian Road and other places on Changjiang Road also completed many transactions, which was very impressive. Although yesterday's market was scorching hot, still over 1,300 barrels were bought and sold in the market. The price of American goods was 7 taels 6 qian, Belgian goods were 7 taels 5 qian, German and Japanese goods were 7 taels 3 qian and a half, and local factory goods with mixed grades were around 7 taels. Furthermore, brokers have been manipulating the market for several days, so the market price has seen another price increase, causing various grades to increase their asking prices by 1 qian per barrel. Therefore, people in the industry are thinking of raising prices firmly, and the future market outlook is even more optimistic.</p>

<h3>Jianghai Customs Prohibits the Northern Transport of Rice and Grain</h3>
<p>Large Quantities of Rice Are Blocked in Shanghai</p>
<p>Weihai, Yantai, and Tianjin Are All Not Allowed to Be Shipped To</p>
<p>Since the closure of the Tianjin Customs, difficulties have arisen in North-South maritime transport. After requests from various merchants, Tianjin Customs has allowed foreign ships to pay a security deposit, and Chinese ships to submit tax bills as a measure of accommodation. Goods to be transported north can then be inspected and unloaded. However, this year, various parts of our country are suffering from famine, especially North China. Since the outbreak of military operations, the food required by the North has always relied entirely on transport from the South. As a result, a problem has arisen. Recently, because the North has come to Shanghai to purchase and transport large quantities of rice and grain, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs has issued an order prohibiting exports. The details of this matter are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Purchasing Rice to Be Shipped to Tianjin: The Tianjin area has always needed food supplies, which are entirely purchased from Shanghai. The main item is flour, most of which is undertaken by various flour mills in Shanghai, and transported by sea. This year, a considerable amount of American wheat flour was also shipped during the spring. Recently, since the order prohibiting the export of flour was issued, the Tianjin side has faced a major panic regarding the food supply for the people, due to the reduction in flour coming from the South. About ten days ago, Tianjin officials were dispatched to Shanghai to purchase large quantities of foreign rice. Whether it was Rangoon rice or Annamese rice, all were needed. It is heard that a large quantity has already been purchased. The first batch had already been entrusted to a British merchant ship to be shipped first in several thousand bags, directly to Tianjin for unloading. However, many of the remaining bags are awaiting shipment. The Jianghai Customs' prohibition order has been issued, and they are not allowed to be exported.</p>
<p>Negotiations for Shipment to Tianjin: It is reported that the first batch, which had already been purchased, consisted of tens of thousands of bags. Last week, the person in charge was entrusted to first contact the Chinese Merchant Steam Navigation Company to request that it provide ships for transportation. When the Chinese ships were on vacation, the request to carry the goods was refused. The shipment was then switched to North Sea liners of British and Japanese foreign merchants in this port. Each ship carried 4,000 bags northward at a time, with the unloading location being Tianjin. The foreign merchant ships had already received the goods and were scheduled to report the export after the 20th. They are now being blocked by the Customs.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Reporting Shipment: A certain British ship, which was carrying 4,000 bags of rice and grain, reported to Jianghai Customs that it was exporting the rice to be unloaded in Tianjin. The Customs, having received the order prohibiting the transport of rice to Tianjin, refused to allow the export and immediately returned the customs declaration. The British ship, having promised the customer that it could load the goods beforehand and the business was also large, returned to the Customs and requested to change the unloading destination to Yantai, in order to avoid the prohibition. The ship then reported the shipment again, but was again rejected by the Customs, which stated that Yantai was also within the prohibited transport area and that it was not convenient to change. In the end, the owner of the goods had to ship the rice no matter what, and was willing to have more complicated procedures and pay more for transshipment, but it had to be transported. After consulting with the shipping company, a Westerner from the company personally went to the Customs to request that the port of unloading be changed again for this exported rice, and to be loaded to Weihaiwei for unloading. Weihaiwei is a British leased territory, so it should not be subject to the prohibition. However, under negotiation, it was still not possible to accommodate the request. The Customs still did not allow the export, and the rice that had already been loaded on the ship had to be brought back to the dock.</p>
<p>Transshipment News: According to continued news obtained yesterday, because Weihai, Yantai, and Tianjin cannot be landed in, the owner of the goods is still trying to proceed. It is heard that they have contacted a Japanese shipping company to transport the rice directly from Shanghai to Dalian Bay for unloading, and then transfer it to the Tianjin-Dalian liner, paying an additional freight charge. Whether it can be shipped out is still unknown.</p>
<h3>The Consular Body Replies to the Foreign Ministry Regarding the Sale of the Concession Telephone Company</h3>
<p>Strong Language</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that regarding the sale of the Shanghai Chinese-Foreign Telephone Company, the Consular Body has replied to the Foreign Ministry with tactful but firm language. It states that the sale of the company, according to the British Companies Act, has been formally established, and the Shanghai Municipal Council's granting of concession rights to the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation has also been handled according to proper procedures. In addition, it expresses that the existence of this concession right will not hinder future discussions on the status of the concession.</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan Discusses the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Is Conducting Informal Negotiations</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Factory Has a Very Strong Attitude</p>
<p>Since the tragic incident occurred in the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike, it has become increasingly serious. The number of strikers has reached more than a thousand, estimated to be 60-70% of the factory's employees. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper interviewed Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, to inquire about the aftermath measures. His remarks are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mediation Ineffective: Since the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike occurred, the Bureau of Social Affairs has tried to mediate. The labor side put forward four demands, with the main condition being an increase of eight yuan per month for each person. The labor side cited the factory's use of funds to increase the salaries of a few employees as a pretext. However, the Bureau of Social Affairs twice invited representatives from both sides to the bureau for consultation, and the labor side arrived as scheduled, but the factory side has not sent anyone, so mediation has not been possible.</p>
<p>Arbitration Conference: According to the Labor Dispute Law, when the Bureau of Social Affairs cannot mediate, it should request the Municipal Government to convene a Labor-Capital Arbitration Committee meeting to resolve the issue. Therefore, the bureau has already submitted a request to the Municipal Government for handling last week and is currently conducting informal negotiations with the French Consul, etc., but there is no progress yet. The Labor-Capital Arbitration Conference will be convened after the negotiations are completed.</p>
<p>Reasons for Difficulties: The only reason why the resolution of this strike is slightly difficult is that the actual power of the factory is completely in the hands of the board of directors in Paris, and everything must be instructed and handled. The board of directors has a strong attitude, stating that they do not need to be subject to Chinese law, so the strike has become increasingly worse. Previously, Mr. Du Yuesheng had come forward in a private capacity to mediate, and the conditions had all been agreed upon. The strike could have been resolved, but the factory side suddenly and fundamentally overturned the agreement, leaving the intermediary helpless.</p>
<p>Final Method: Pan also said that if it is absolutely impossible to resolve the issue, it may be necessary to use diplomatic methods. However, they are currently making every effort to avoid this last resort. Furthermore, the factory also values its business and does not want this dispute to continue, so it is expected that there will be appropriate measures soon. The four water mains of the French Concession Water Company are all in the Chinese-controlled area and are being closely protected by the authorities, as is the water plant, in order to ensure that the residents of the French Concession do not suffer from a lack of drinking water, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's News on the French Business Water and Electricity Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>Municipal Party Committee Members Stationed at the Labor Union for Guidance</p>
<p>The Labor Union and Supporting Committee Sent a Letter to the French Consul</p>
<p>Party Committee Stationed: After the French business water and electricity workers' strike expanded, the situation became increasingly serious. In addition to telegraphing the central government and requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the French ambassador, the Municipal Party Committee specially dispatched Committee Member Yang Qingyuan to Beijing to report the course of the labor strike and the truth of the tragedy, and to request instructions on how to handle the matter. The newspaper briefly reported these details yesterday. It is now learned that the Party Committee believes that the labor union should not be without leadership during the serious period of the labor strike. Therefore, it was decided that Comrade Hou Dachun should be stationed at the labor union to be responsible for guiding all progress.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Meeting: The Municipal Government specially convened a meeting yesterday morning, and representatives from the Municipal Party Committee also participated. Specific measures for the water and electricity workers' strike were discussed, and Secretary Geng was dispatched to the French Consul-General's Office to negotiate with the French Consul. It is reported that the results were extremely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Staff Meeting: The French Electric Company's Chinese Staff Support Committee held a meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than a hundred staff members attended. The meeting proceeded as scheduled. Zhang Renjun was elected as the temporary chairman, and the purpose of the meeting was reported. Subsequently, eleven committee members were elected, namely Feng Zhiming, Feng Shenghuan, Zhang Renjun, Fan Baokun, Xu Tingliang, Xing Wenrong, Hu Zukun, Wang Liefan, Hu Yukang, Chen Hongyuan, and Lu Guanhong, to be responsible for carrying out the work. At that time, the following resolutions were passed: (1) The staff should send a letter to the company, urging the management to realize the situation and resolve the strike as soon as possible. (2) A declaration should be issued. (3) Staff currently employed should be advised to resign as soon as possible to support the workers. (4) The staff should prepare to join the labor union to increase the strength of the group. (5) All members must attend the meeting at 9:00 AM every day.</p>
<p>Staff Strike Declaration: The company staff specially issued a declaration supporting the strike, stating: "The French water and electricity workers, driven by the necessities of life, have been forced to put forward extremely ordinary and appropriate demands, requesting the company to improve treatment in order to maintain their hard life. However, the management, adhering to its imperialist and oppressive tactics, resolutely refused and closed the iron gates, expelling the workers and forcing a strike that has lasted for more than thirty days. The Chinese authorities have been asked to mediate, but the management has no sincerity in accepting the mediation and disregards it. Furthermore, they have intensified their efforts by hiring White Russian new workers to work in the factory, which will leave hundreds of Chinese workers with no way to make a living, and ultimately led to the bloody tragedy on Malan Road on July 21, killing one Chinese person and wounding our apprentice workers with guns. When the bad news came, everyone was shocked and indignant. The staff members belong to the same compatriots and share the same fate. Seeing this crisis, how can we bear to sit idly by? Therefore, more than one hundred Chinese employees in the factory have united to leave the factory immediately, declare support, join the strike front, and fight together to urge the French imperialist capitalists to be sensible and secure the victory for our hundreds of workers. If the goal is not achieved, the strike will not end. This is our declaration, and we hope the public will take note."</p>
<p>Letter from Staff to Factory Management: "Dear Sirs, the fact that the workers in the Machinery Department and others are forced by livelihood to request the company to improve their treatment is due to the environment they are in. Moreover, the price of rice has risen recently, and the cost of living is increasing day by day, making it impossible for the workers to maintain their lives. As for the six demands of the workers, they are peaceful and moderate, and are not beyond the company's capabilities. Even if there are excessive points, they can be discussed calmly. Why should they be ignored, resulting in this strike? After the strike, although there have been several consultations, the company has not sincerely accepted them, and has disregarded the workers' lives. This action is extremely shocking and absurd. Up to now, more than thirty days have passed, and there is still no room for mediation, and the recent tragedy on Malan Road has been brewed. This is something that the staff cannot bear to sit idly by. In order to promote the company's awareness and to prevent both sides from moving to extremes, the staff has no choice but to temporarily suspend their duties to mediate for the workers, so as to avoid the expansion of the labor strike. Therefore, we specially write to request that the company resolve this unfortunate incident as soon as possible. If you are willing to accept our request and first dismiss the new workers and White Russians, so that the old workers can resume work as soon as possible, then the staff can also resume work as soon as possible. We would be extremely grateful and moved to tears. We respectfully submit this request and ask for your consideration." The letter to the French Consul: The manuscript sent by China Eastern Society was mimeographed and blurred, making it impossible to record.</p>
<p>Support from Various District Party Departments: Yesterday, the Third, Fifth, and Sixth District Party Departments of this city, as well as the Ninth, Eighteenth, Fifteenth, Thirtieth, and Thirty-First Sub-District Branches of the Third District, unanimously issued anti-oppression declarations or sent telegrams expressing their firm support for the workers and calling on all sectors of society to fight together. The texts are lengthy and omitted.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Chamber of Commerce Labor Union: "This time, the French business water and electricity labor union is demanding that the company improve their treatment due to rising prices and difficult living conditions. This is a legitimate action, and all human beings should express their sympathy. However, the French imperialist capitalists initially refused in every way, provoking a strike, and then recruited Russian workers to exert pressure, and finally colluded with the police to stage the tragic shooting of unarmed workers on July 21. The violence and tyranny have reached this extreme. How can all our compatriots not feel heartache? We hope that everyone will take practical actions to provide substantial assistance, seek active resistance, and recover the concessions. Our union will lead all its members to serve as their backing. This is our declaration."</p>
<p>Declaration of the Newspaper Industry Labor Union: "The Newspaper Industry Labor Union's Declaration of Support for the Strike of French Concession Water and Electricity Workers: Dear French Business Water and Electricity Workers and All Shanghai Workers, in this period when the labor movement is gradually sprouting, the survival and demands of workers are not worthy of the capitalists' consideration. Unfortunately, this time, the French Business Water and Electricity Workers proposed to the management to appropriately increase salaries and improve treatment due to the high cost of gold and the low value of silver, and the high cost of all goods. This proposal was approved by the party and government authorities, and it was originally a very reasonable matter. Unexpectedly, the French Business Water and Electricity management not only did not accept it with sincerity, but initially perfunctorily dealt with it, then oppressed the workers, and finally allowed armed patrolmen to carry out a forceful resolution. As a result, a bloody tragedy of shooting and sweeping more than 20 unarmed workers on Malan Road on July 21, 1920, was created. Innocent workers were subjected to such massacre. However, the fierce flames of French imperialism and the venomous nature of the French Business Water and Electricity management have clearly exposed their hideousness. We cannot ignore this incident (the July 21st incident in which French imperialism shot and killed French Business Water and Electricity workers on Malan Road in 1919 has the same meaning as the British imperialism's massacre of citizens on Nanjing Road on May 30, 1914). We believe that this incident is clearly a conflict between French imperialism and the rising revolutionary sentiment in our country. The incompatibility between the French Business Water and Electricity management and their running dog hooligans and the true workers. For the sake of the independence of the Chinese national revolution, and standing on the same interests of the workers, we cannot stand by and hesitate or discriminate. Therefore, we are extremely hopeful that this time the French Business Water and Electricity workers can fight to the end under these bleak and dim circumstances, in order to obtain the final victory, the victory of humanity and justice. In addition to calling on the people of the whole country and the 800,000 workers in Shanghai to pay attention, we are also willing to provide as much practical assistance as possible. This is our declaration. Shanghai Newspaper Industry Labor Union, July 23."</p>
<h3>The Land Bureau Is Actively Collecting Upper and Lower Season Land Tax</h3>
<p>Collection Scheduled to Begin on August 1st</p>
<p>Public Notice to Inform All City Residents</p>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau issued a public notice yesterday regarding the scheduled collection of the upper and lower season land tax for all districts of the city starting on August 1st. The notice stated: "For the matter of the public notice, the joint collection of the upper and lower season land tax in various districts of the city has been approved by the Municipal Government for implementation. The collection of the season tax for the nineteenth year of the Republic of China is now scheduled to begin on August 1st. The tax for this season is as follows: 1.5 yuan of regular tax silver per tael, 0.25 yuan of municipal surtax silver, 0.3 yuan of local surtax silver, and 0.123 yuan of handling fee silver. In addition, various surcharges, collectively known as the municipal administration expenses, will still be collected per mu as before and will be listed separately in the grain certificate. From the date of collection, there will be a two-month deadline for payment. If the payment is not completed within the deadline, a surcharge of 20% will be added. If the payment is still not completed after another two-month extension, a surcharge of 10% will be added as a penalty for late payment. Furthermore, the bureau has taken over the collection of land tax from the counties of Shanghai and Baoshan that have been incorporated into the city. For the fees in the former Baoshan County, there has been no distribution of separate receipts in the past, and there has been no inconvenience for the people to pay grain. The districts in the former Shanghai County originally had separate receipts. Now, after deliberation by the Bureau Affairs Meeting, it has been decided to abolish them as well, starting from this season's tax, in order to unify the system. All property owners who are required to pay new tax should pay at the counter based on the latest grain certificate. In addition to reporting to the Municipal Government and notifying them separately, this public notice is hereby issued to inform the people of the city. It is necessary to pay taxes as an obligation of the people. All property owners who are required to pay the season tax and various surcharges must complete the payment within the time limit, obtain the grain certificate, and settle their business. Do not hesitate to wait and see. This notice is of utmost importance."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests the Abolition of Duplicate Taxes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, due to the fact that the tax collection agencies in Zhejiang Province repeatedly levied taxes on cotton fabrics approved by the Ministry of Finance, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday, requesting their abolition. The original text stated: "To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance: On the 21st of this month, a letter from the silk-mercerized cotton fabric industry association in this city stated that the cotton fabric business has been declining in recent years. Since last winter, nearly half of the businesses have gone bankrupt, and most of the existing factories are also on the verge of collapse. The harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies in various provinces are increasing day by day. Recently, a letter from the Yongjia Silk and Cloth Industry Association in Zhejiang Province stated that the various sub-bureaus and enforcement offices are obstructing and levying taxes on imported local cloth. Even if there are registered certificates, the Bureau of Cloth says that there is no express written order for tax exemption, and it is difficult to take effect. They still obstruct and levy taxes. After all the businesses debated with them, they were finally allowed to temporarily record the amount of tax to be paid within one month. If the Finance Office still does not have an explicit tax exemption document by August 10, it will collect the full amount from each business, etc. Please forward it to the Ministry of Finance and strictly order the Finance Office to order all tax offices to exempt all duplicate levies, except for the payment of regular surtax at the first customs office when exporting, according to the regulations, etc., and attach a comparative table of surcharge amounts to the meeting. According to the nature of silk-mercerized cotton fabrics, they are all machine-made imitations of foreign-style goods. The registered certificate mentioned in the original letter refers to the certificate approved by the Ministry to exempt duplicate levies. Cotton textile factories of this type are opened in Shanghai. According to the regulations, they only need to pay the regular surtax at the first customs office in Shanghai when exporting. After that, holding the waybill, they can travel throughout the country and be exempted from duplicate levies. This has been a common practice for decades. The Zhejiang tax bureau actually said that there is no explicit written order for tax exemption. It is shocking that the management of the tax affairs is so ignorant of national laws. Currently, the cases of Dafeng and the First Textile Factory in Hankou being illegally and repeatedly levied taxes by Zhejiang Province have been repeatedly requested for investigation and have not yet been resolved. Furthermore, similar incidents have occurred in silk-mercerized cotton factories in this city. If this is said to promote domestic goods, it is like going south by driving the chariot north, and the result is friendship. It is appropriate to telegraph your ministry to verify and inform the Zhejiang Finance Office to strictly order the tax bureau to handle matters in accordance with the regulations and immediately abolish the practice of repeated levies, so as to maintain a glimmer of hope for the fabric factory. It is in the public interest. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce." The telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government was roughly the same (omitted).</p>
<h3>The Red Cross to Hold a General Assembly in the Next Term</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, at the general assembly of the Chinese Red Cross on April 24, Wang Yiting, Wang Zhengting, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Peiyuan, Yan Huiqing, Yu Qiaqing, Qian Yongming, Wen Lanting, Liu Hongsheng, Lin Kanghou, Guan Jiongzhi, Yu Youren, Zhu Qinglan, Tai Xiling, Nie Yuntai, Di Chuqing, Chen Bingqian, Yan Fuqing, Yin Cuihe, Ye Gongchuo, Zheng Hongnian, Shi Liangcai, Wang Boqi, Rong Zongjing, Yao Yuqin, Tan Rongpu, Huang Hanzhi, Yuan Ludeng, Bei Songsun, Cai Tinggan, Tang Shaoyi, Du Yuesheng, Gu Zhuxuan, Xu Shiying, Chen Jiageng, Yang Xiaochuan, Wu Kaisheng, Shen Zhuowu, Li Cishan, Ji Heqin, Jiang Lianqiu, and dozens of others were elected as standing councilors. At 10 PM that night, dozens of people suddenly held weapons and made a scene at the meeting place, claiming that a re-election was necessary. Wang Peiyuan replied that this was an illegal act and could not be allowed. The crowd roared for a long time before leaving. As a result, the minutes of the general assembly and other documents were lost. The next day, several officials of the General Assembly, including Bao Kangning, and representatives of the branch associations opened a re-election committee on Tianjin Road, electing Ye Zhisheng, Zhou Guozhen, Wu Jiasan, Dong Lin, Gu Keyong, Shen Laisen, Zhou Guangjiu, Wang Peiyuan, Wei Ruifeng, and Wu Yaosan as re-election committee members. On the morning of the 28th, the General Assembly was again vandalized by many people. In the afternoon, the re-election committee voted. Wang Yiting, Guan Jiongzhi, and others proposed to elect 24 additional people, and requested the National Government to select them. The proposal was passed on the spot. However, during the voting, it suddenly changed again, and 49 people were still voted for, and it was noted on the votes that it was a re-election. Hu Hongji, a representative sent by the National Government, and Wang Yansong, a representative sent by the Municipal Party Department, supervised the election. When the votes were being counted, Wen Lanting strongly refuted the illegality of the re-election and pointed out many facts. Ji Heqin presented evidence of Dong Lin and Wu Jiasan's written threats. Hu Hongji and others then refused to count the votes and left. Members and others repeatedly appealed to the National Government, and the National Government ordered the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau to investigate the perpetrators. Shen Laisen, a member of the re-election committee, was arrested by the Special Zone Court for destroying the Red Cross in another case. The old standing council believed that such disputes were not good for the Red Cross, so it sent a letter to the branch associations, deciding to hold a temporary representative assembly on August 10 to resolve the election and all other issues.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Protects the Red Cross</h3>
<p>The China Red Cross Society previously received a telegram from the Guangrao Branch in Shandong stating that the northern and southern armies were fighting between Guangrao and Linzi, and that the rescue team had rushed to the rescue. It requested letters to both sides ordering their subordinates to protect them. The society immediately telegraphed based on the situation. Now, according to a telegram from Chairman Zhuang himself from the front line: "To the China Red Cross General Assembly: I have received your telegram. I have forwarded it to all the forward units on the Jiaoji Line for protection. Special reply."</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan's Order on the Standard for Milling Brown Rice</h3>
<p>Must Not Be Lower Than 75%</p>
<p>And Must Be Higher Than 85%</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan of the National Government, seeing the food panic of the people, has specially stipulated the standard for milling brown rice. Its order to the Shanghai Municipal Government states: "(Omitted above) This year, the whole country is suffering from food shortages. Since this month, it has been the time of year when the crops from the previous year have run out and the new crops have not yet been harvested. The future of the people's food supply is deeply worrying. In all rice-producing areas, brown rice is milled into refined white rice, which is commonly called 'machine-milled rice.' This type of rice grain can only be milled to seven斗 from one stone of brown rice. This is an extreme waste of natural resources and a damage to the people's food supply. Investigating the milling of brown rice into coarsely milled rice, compared with machine-milled rice, can yield one more 斗, and it is still clean and smooth. If this is done, ten stone of brown rice can yield one stone of white rice. One stone of rice is enough for a family of eight for a month. This will benefit the people's food supply. The standard for milling rice grains has now been stipulated. It must not be lower than 75% and must be higher than 85% to save resources and enrich the people's food supply."</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Arrives Vigorously</h3>
<p>Indica Rice Import Price Plummets</p>
<p>Due to the sunny and hot weather in recent days, a large amount of foreign indica rice has been imported. In addition, the production in Saigon and other places is abundant. Therefore, the import price has fallen again and again. Recently, the indica rice entering the market has fallen from around 17.5 yuan to around 14-5 yuan. It is expected that it will continue to fall within the day. There is hope that the price of rice will fall.</p>
<h3>Committee of the Shanghai County Reorganization Committee</h3>

<h3>Baoshan County Held a County Government Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Baoshan County Magistrate Qiu Mingjiu convened a county government meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday. Those present were Shen Jing, Huang Zengju, Xue Ying, Wang Tongchuan, Wang Cheng, Bei Jietai, Han Bingheng, Sun Qixian, and Tao Qingfeng. The chairman was County Magistrate Qiu. Report matters: (1) The Education Department issued directive No. 5497, stating that the proposed simplified rules for sending midwifery students are still feasible.

Discussion Matters: (1) The chairman discussed the requests from the fishing association's Tang Wangsong, Xiaojia Wang Shengxiang, and others to reduce the license fee and provide office subsidies, and to follow the Jiading charge of one yuan for the license fee, split into upper and lower payments. It was resolved to reduce the fee by five 角 according to the original regulations, that is, 1.5 yuan per license, and to set aside 20% as the fishing association's office subsidy, calculated as the actual license fee paid per license of 1.2 yuan, which is still paid in full in accordance with the previous regulations.</p>
<h3>The Approved Reply to Dredging the Pootung Shore in the South City</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government approved and replied to the submission from Xing Zhigang and others, stating: "According to the report from the Port Authority, the cost of this Pootung shore is special and huge, and there is no space for comprehensive dredging to provide berths for civilian ships. It seems that it can be handled slowly for now. As for the disordered placement of bamboo and wood rafts, strict measures should be taken in accordance with the regulations to facilitate traffic, etc." After verifying the facts, the instructions are approved as proposed. This is to notify. After the representative received the approval, it is said that he still plans to request the Port Authority to dredge the shallow areas near the guild hall wharf and the Wanyu Yongyi wharf to facilitate berthing.</p>
<h3>The Gold Standard Monetary System Law Has Been Published</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of gold being expensive and silver being cheap, and the method of unifying the national monetary system, the local Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau previously collected materials, compiled them into a book and published them. It has now been proofread and published, including three volumes in Chinese, English, and Chinese-English bilingual editions. It is named "Draft Law on China's Gradual Adoption of the Gold Standard Monetary System." The bureau specially presented five copies of the published sample, along with each version, to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The ministry considered that the content of this book contained detailed information on the gold standard and the monetary system law, which was very clear. Yesterday, the ministry ordered the bureau to print hundreds of additional copies for distribution to various agencies for reference.</p>
<h3>The Conference Record of the Save Guizhou Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Xijiu Save Guizhou Association, some days ago, held a general meeting in Beijing with Deng, and approximately 80 people attended. Xu Tianfang was elected as chairman. After the formalities, Zhang reported on the previous trip to Beijing with Xu Tianfang to meet with the central government and the arrangement for Yan Dezhang, a special envoy of the government, to come from Yunnan to assist in reorganizing the government with Xi Yun. The meeting also received a telegram stating that he had already arrived in Longzhou, and would enter Nanning with the Yunnan army, as well as a letter from Lin Chu, a participant in the Eighth Route Army Headquarters, reporting on the coordination of military matters (due to their confidential nature, they could not be announced). Subsequently, Xu Tianfang reported that Huang Ziqi, a member of the Guizhou Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, had sent a letter stating that preparations were underway within the province for similar organizations to carry out the movement to save Guizhou, and that he had telegraphed the central party headquarters, expressing sympathy with the organizational significance of the association and requesting assistance. The meeting also received a letter from the Guizhou Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing dated July 14, stating that the association had held a general meeting on June 29 and resolved to unanimously sympathize with the association's activities. Zhou Tiancha then reported on the military situation in Xun Gui and his plan to return to work in Guizhou in the near future. Afterwards, Qin Jingzhuang and He Pinzhi successively reported on the tragic situation in Lipu, where Li Huang and others had extorted donations. Finally, it was resolved to send a telegram to the central government and the commanders of the various routes, stating their opinions on resolving the situation in Guizhou. The text of the telegram was as follows: (Titles omitted) "We believe that Guizhou's military affairs should not be entrusted to pure comrades with a deep and long history of revolutionary struggle, who can carry out the central government's intentions and sincerely appease the people to root out the deeply entrenched reactionary forces of Li Huang. Moreover, Guizhou's party and government should not be led by opportunistic politicians and corrupt elements colluding with each other, who can only lead the masses to the right path. In the past half year, how much have the central government's military and material losses to Guizhou been? How much pain have the local people suffered? The provincial government has been reorganized again and again, but the result has been more chaotic. As a result, Li Huang was able to harass Hunan from a leisurely position, exhausting our revolutionary soldiers.

<h3>Yesterday's News of the Pootung Nichihua Cotton Mill Strike</h3>
<p>The Factory Refuses Mediation</p>
<p>The Labor's Attitude Is Firm</p>
<p>The Nichihua Cotton Mill in Pootung has been on strike for three days. Yesterday, representatives from the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau went to negotiate for the second time, but the factory's attitude was tough and it refused to accept any proposals, resulting in no progress. Seeing this situation, all the workers in the factory hated the factory's inhumanity even more, and unanimously decided to persevere to the end, adopting an attitude of ignoring the factory. No matter how long it takes, if the factory does not come to negotiate, they will never go to the factory to negotiate themselves. It is said that the Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau are also taking the same attitude.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the unions in Pootung believe that this dispute at the Nichihua Cotton Mill is not only related to the interests of all the workers in the factory, but also affects the interests of all the unions in Pootung. The demands of the workers this time, such as "two-five-one" and "seven-nine" double pay, are clearly stipulated by the National Government, and all factories in Pootung are following them. If the factory refuses to comply, other factories will also deny it. Therefore, if the Nichihua strike is not resolved properly this time, it will trigger a huge strike in Pootung. It is said that the unions in Pootung have already planned ways to deal with the factory, and will do everything they can to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of the Municipal Finance Bureau's Crackdown on a Superstitious Donation and Fake Organization</h3>
<p>Finance Bureau's Report on the Crackdown Process</p>
<p>Requesting the Public Security Bureau to Vigorously Arrest the Principal Offender</p>
<p>A fake organization collecting superstitious "confession" donations was discovered in Lannidu, Pudong. The Municipal Finance Bureau's South District Tax Collection Office, in conjunction with the Third District Public Security Bureau, seized privately made seals and documents and multiple fake organization staff members, who were handed over to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. These details were reported previously. Now, we have learned that the Municipal Finance Bureau's South District Tax Collection Office has submitted a detailed report on the crackdown process to the Finance Bureau. Regarding the matter of organizing superstitious "sutra repentance" donations, the Bureau had previously received repeated applications from merchant Zhang Youshi to handle the project. This was forwarded to the Municipal Government for instructions and was ordered to be postponed. This decision was communicated to Zhang Youshi. Now, according to the report from the South District Tax Collection Office, Zhang Youshi, without awaiting approval for the superstitious "sutra repentance" donation, dared to privately establish a collection organization, fraudulently obtaining money. This was extremely illegal. The Bureau immediately sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, instructing them to interrogate and investigate the apprehended individuals, including Lu Hai, and ordered them to vigorously arrest Zhang Youshi and bring him to justice. At the same time, the Bureau submitted a report to the Municipal Government regarding the circumstances of the crackdown. A summary of the facts regarding the South District Tax Collection Office's destruction of this case is extracted as follows: On the 18th of this month, the Tax Collection Office discovered in Pudong a document signed by Zhong Yuan, the "Director of the South District Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's Superstitious 'Sutra Repentance' Donation Collection Office," appointing Zhong Huidin as the "Chief Inspector." This was deeply puzzling, as the suppression of "sutra repentance" and the elimination of superstition, although previously proposed for donation collection, had never been implemented. Now, someone dared to privately establish an organization, forge documents, and fraudulently use the name of the Finance Bureau to recruit staff and parade around, which was extremely audacious. The Office dispatched clerk Cheng Fengyun, along with the stationed Tax Collection Patrol Leader Cheng Yushu, to thoroughly investigate the location of this fake organization. A letter was prepared and sent to the relevant police district, requesting police assistance. Clerk Cheng, accompanied by Patrol Leader Cheng Yushu, immediately went to various locations in Pudong in plain clothes to investigate. They found two Western-style buildings at No. 5 Lannidu Road, with two long strips of white paper pasted on either side of the door, one reading "Shanghai Finance Bureau Superstitious 'Sutra Repentance' Donation South District Preparatory Branch" and the other "Same Style Pudong District Preparatory Branch." Upon inspection, several inspectors were found inside. According to accountant Lu Hai, both branch directors were Zhong Yuan, from Fenghua County, Zhejiang, who was currently at the head office on official business. The office had been rented since the first month of the lunar year and had been preparing for several months but had not yet begun collecting donations. He claimed to be unaware of the details. Upon further questioning, inspectors Yao Yinxing, Chen Shengrong, Chen Jinlian, Huang Jiachang, Chen Diechu, Li Guowu, Zhu Daohui, Wang Zhidin, and others, mostly from Ningbo, Taizhou, and other places, claimed to have paid "movement fees" of one hundred yuan, fifty yuan, and forty yuan, respectively. Except for Lu Hai, who had been preparing with Zhong Yuan for a long time, most of them had been hired in early July and lived upstairs. In addition, there were Zhong Huidin, Zhu Daoxun, Luo Youcai, Li Guowen, Wang Yunchuang, and more than ten others who were said to be out and not yet returned. Upstairs, two rooms were used as dormitories for the staff. Downstairs, two rooms were used as offices. Zhong Yuan's wife, Zhong Ying, and children lived in the back room. Zhong Ying then claimed that her husband, Zhong Yuan, had paid more than seven hundred yuan to the "head office" and had already spent it all. She produced two "appointment letters" from the so-called "head office," namely Zhang Youshi, "Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's Superstitious 'Sutra Repentance' Donation Collection Office," appointing Zhong Yuan as the "Director of the South District and Pudong District." There was also a copy of the "Shanghai Special Municipality Superstition Donation Collection Regulations." When asked where the "head office" was located, they claimed that the office had recently moved and was only known to be located in the Baoshan Road and Yongxing Road area of Zhabei, but the exact address was unknown. Clerk Cheng and others, after interrogating them, feared that they might be nervous and attempt to escape. Therefore, Patrol Leader Cheng Yushu was assigned to temporarily guard them, while they went to the First District to deliver a letter, requesting District Chief Zhang to send police assistance. Police Officer Tong was dispatched with four policemen to search the premises. In addition to all the furniture and other items in the house, an inventory was made, and the police were left to guard them. The seals of the Pudong Public Office and account books of bribery money were also copied, along with Zhong Ying, Lu Hai, and a total of ten people, and taken to the district for investigation. During the interrogation, Zhong Yuan was apprehended and brought to the district by the patrol police. According to his statement, he did not know the truth of the matter and placed all the responsibility on Zhang Youshi, who falsely claimed to be the Director of the head office. Later, District Chief Zhang of the Third District requested instructions from Bureau Chief Yuan. Zhong Yuan and the ten other men and women were sent to the Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>An Appeal from Hanzhong, Shaanxi</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Foreign Charity Relief Association received a letter yesterday from Chinese and foreign members of the Foreign Relief Association in Hanzhong, Shaanxi, appealing for aid. The letter is excerpted as follows: "Since 1927, Hanzhong has suffered disasters every year, and last year, the drought was particularly severe. From spring to autumn, there was no rain at all, and all vegetation withered. The five grains failed to produce any crops, and even the mountains and marshes were exhausted, making drinking water difficult to find. Afterwards, heavy snow fell, and we hoped for a prosperous year, but the extreme cold was unprecedented. The disaster victims have no food to eat and no clothes to keep warm, resulting in countless deaths of disaster victims and livestock. The situation is even worse this spring. Those who relied on grass roots and tree bark to survive have quickly run out of these as well. The so-called 'bare walls' families have already sold even those walls. The city and the fields are filled with starving people, and all that can be heard is the crying of hunger and cold. The dead are piled up, and there is no time to bury them. The foul air is breeding epidemics, and it is estimated that more than a thousand people are dying every day. The main agricultural products of Hanzhong are rice and corn. This spring, seven or eight out of ten people have lost their seeds and have nothing to plant, so there is no hope for an autumn harvest. The situation is unimaginable. The most severely affected areas in the Hanzhong disaster area include the entire counties of Lueyang, Fengxian, Mianxian, Ningqiang, Yangxian, and Xixiang, as well as the northwest areas of Nanzheng and Chenggu counties, and the northeast, west, and northwest areas of Baocheng. The other areas of Nancheng and Baocheng, as well as the counties of Zhenba, Foping, and Liuba, are slightly less affected. In addition, all counties under Ankang are likely to be affected by the drought. It is estimated that there are more than two million disaster victims waiting for relief. Due to the rugged mountain roads, inconvenient transportation, and the time required for postal and telegraphic communication, the news has been delayed, resulting in charitable individuals investigating and distributing relief not arriving. Our Association is pleading for the people until our voices are hoarse, and we have finally obtained a relief fund of 10,000 yuan from your Association. However, at this critical moment of life and death, this is just a drop in the bucket. We hope that all charitable individuals will embrace a sense of equality and perform acts of generous giving and universal salvation. If you raise any further relief funds, please distribute them equally to Hanzhong and remit them quickly so that we can promptly take action to provide emergency relief to alleviate the suffering and implement long-term relief to benefit the source of the disaster. Do not let the more than two million starving and desperate people suffer the tragedy of being turned away without relief."</p>

<h3>Lu Genrong's Release on Bail</h3>
<p>Applying for Bail Out of Custody Following Precedent</p>
<p>Court Interrogation of Various Circumstances</p>
<p>Tang Weizhi Provides a Guarantee of Fifty Yuan</p>
<p>Lu Will Come to Shanghai to Seek a Living</p>
<p>Suzhou Express Mail: After Lu Genrong was granted permission to be released from custody, he entrusted the Rongxing Tobacco and Paper Shop in Pingqiao yesterday (the 23rd) to provide a written guarantee of fifty yuan and submitted it to the High Court for release from prison. The original text of this petition is attached below:</p>
<p>Criminal Petition Petitioner: Lu Genrong, regarding a case that has been judged and declared innocent, but the plaintiff official has appealed and the case has not been finalized, requests to be released from custody pending trial following precedent. Since the petitioner was detained on June 24th of the lunar calendar in the 17th year of the Republic for being accused of enticement and theft, the case has been repeatedly tried and sent back for retrial twice by the Supreme Court, lasting for two years. Fortunately, the court has now declared him innocent in the second retrial. He deeply hopes to regain his freedom soon. However, the plaintiff official filed an appeal during the period before the judgment was finalized. However, only Article 1, Section 1, Clause 3 of the Regulations on Detaining Defendants in Civil and Criminal Cases, promulgated by the President on September 13th, 1921, stipulates that those who have been judged and declared innocent, even if the plaintiff or prosecutor appeals, should be released pending trial. This regulation is listed in the laws and regulations of the National Government, promulgated by the late Premier in the Guangdong government, and is naturally still valid. Furthermore, the petitioner's suspected crimes, except for the enticement portion, which has been dismissed, the plaintiff official also acknowledges that there are no issues with the aiding and abetting theft portion. The plaintiff official's argument for appeal only mentions a slight suspicion of transporting stolen goods, which is not among the offenses with the lightest principal punishment of five years or more of imprisonment. The petitioner has parents who can be entrusted with his care, and Wu Ta has a fixed residence. Regarding the witnesses and evidence in this case, they have been thoroughly investigated in previous trials, and none of the circumstances listed in Articles 41 to 43 of Article 66 of the Criminal Procedure Law apply. There is no conflict with the provisions of Article 6 of the aforementioned regulation promulgated by the late Premier. Furthermore, the court has approved the release on bail of many defendants who have been declared innocent in cases where the plaintiff official has filed appeals that have not yet been finalized. The petitioner should also receive the same treatment. Therefore, this petition is submitted, requesting the court to examine and approve it, and to check the provisions of Clause 3 of Section 1 of Article 1 of the aforementioned regulations, as well as the precedents for bailing out defendants in cases pending appeal, and to grant release pending trial, in order to comply with the legislative spirit of the late Premier and to uphold the court's authority in treating all equally, so that the petitioner can avoid further detention and await the Supreme Court's third judgment. We respectfully request an immediate ruling for implementation. Respectfully submitted to the Jiangsu High Court.</p>
<p>Another letter: Yesterday (the 23rd), after Lu Genrong received the ruling, he commissioned lawyer Song Mingxun to draft a bail bond and stated that he was unable to raise the cash bail at this time and requested written bail. Lawyer Song submitted the petition to the High Court at 8:00 AM, and Judge Zhao approved it and immediately signed a ticket ordering the police at the Jiangsu Third Prison Substation on Hengjie Street, Wuxian County, to bring Lu Genrong to the court. Lu's cousin, Tang Weizhi, provided the guarantee. At 12:00 PM, Judge Zhao Zhengcheng, accompanied by clerk Xu Heng, took his seat in the Third Court, brought Lu Genrong and ordered the guarantor Tang Weizhi to appear in court. He first asked Lu Genrong if he wanted to apply for bail. (Answer) Yes. (Question) Did you receive the ruling yesterday? (Answer) Yes. (Question) The ruling stated that a cash guarantee of fifty yuan was required, but why couldn't you raise it and wanted to change it to a written guarantee? (Answer) Because I can't think of a way. My family is also very poor, and I have been in prison for two years. I really can't think of a way. (Question) What is your relationship with Tang Weizhi? (Answer) He is a friend of my father. (Instruction) Your case has already been finalized, but because the prosecutor has filed an appeal, your innocence is still uncertain, so you are required to post bail. But after you go out, you must behave yourself and not do such things again. (Answer) I dare not. (Question) I heard that after you go out, you want to file a lawsuit against Zhihua Hospital to demand compensation from Huang Yongnian. Is this true? (Answer) This was just a thought while in prison. (Instruction) Don't create any more problems after you go out. If you are summoned, you must appear promptly. (Answer) Of course. He then questioned Tang Weizhi, who stated that he was thirty-six years old and from Nanbeiqiao, Wuxian County. (Question) What shop are you guaranteeing? (Answer) Rongxing Tobacco and Paper Shop on Shizijie Street. (Question) How much capital does Rongxing have? (Answer) One or two thousand yuan. (Question) What position do you hold there? (Answer) I am the manager. (Question) Do you know the responsibility you are guaranteeing? (Answer) Yes. (Question) What responsibility do you know? (Answer) If Lu Genrong is summoned in the future, he will appear promptly. Tang Weizhi immediately submitted a guarantee letter stating: "I, Tang Weizhi, hereby guarantee that Lu Genrong will be on bail in Suzhou City under the criminal court of the Jiangsu High Court, and will appear whenever summoned. If he fails to appear when summoned, all the guarantee money of fifty yuan will be forfeited to the guarantor's willingness to pay immediately as ordered. If he fails to pay, he is willing to be subject to compulsory execution. This guarantee letter is made in accordance with Article 75, Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Tang Weizhi (signed), July 23, 1930." After receiving the guarantee letter, Judge Zhao immediately ordered Lu Genrong's release in court. After Lu Genrong was released from the court, he returned to his hometown with his cousin Tang Weizhi on the same day. Lu stated that he would go to Shanghai to find business in the near future.</p>
<h3>Today's Reopening of the Debate on the "Diehard" Case</h3>
<p>Director of the Star Film Company and professor of drama at Fudan University, Mr. Hong Shen, previously filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai Special District Local Court against Mr. Gao Jingqing, shareholder and manager of the Da Guangming Cinema, for showing the film "Diehard" starring the Westerner Locke, which was allegedly insulting to the Chinese nation. The court has held hearings on the case but has not yet reached a verdict. The court has now rescheduled the reopening of the debate for this month's 24th (today) in the afternoon. Yesterday, the plaintiff's lawyers, Zhan Jifeng and Wu Chengyu, and others received a court notice and are preparing to appear in court at that time to present their case.</p>
<h3>Tong Sanmao Sentenced to Two Years</h3>
<p>Huang Baiying Did Not Appear in Person Yesterday</p>
<p>Sanmao Still Prepares to Appeal</p>
<p>The sensational case of the dancer Huang Baiying being forced to take poison has been ongoing for more than twenty days. The court has held three hearings on the case, and the details have been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning was the date for the pronouncement of the verdict in the case. The authorities of the Special District Local Court, in view of the previous crowding of the audience and the lack of legal means to prevent it, ordered two bailiffs in advance yesterday morning to stand guard at the entrance of the Second Court after 7:00 AM. When they saw that the audience seats in the courtroom were full, they prohibited outsiders from entering the court. Although the number of people who went to listen yesterday was not as large as before, all the seats were already occupied before 8:00 AM. The plaintiff, Huang Baiying, did not appear in person and was represented by her lawyer, Zhang Yuanmei. The police lawyer, Bo Liang, Li Zhishan, and the lawyer Zou Yu, who was appointed by the court to defend the defendant, all attended one after another. At 8:40 AM, Judge Wu Tingqi, Prosecutor Xu Mei, and the clerk came to the court and took their seats. The bailiff was ordered to bring the defendant, Tong Sanmao (i.e., Tong Wenbo), from the waiting room and place him in the defendant's position. Tong was still wearing the suit he had worn during the previous interrogation. Judge Wu first asked him for his name and age, then stood up and read out the main text of the judgment: The defendant Tong Sanmao is sentenced to two years of imprisonment for the crime of inciting attempted murder. The number of days in detention before the judgment is determined will be counted as two days to offset one day of imprisonment. After the judgment was pronounced, the bailiff escorted Tong back to the police station to await execution after the judgment is finalized. At that time, Tong did not express his dissatisfaction with the imprisonment in court, but it was heard that he still intends to appeal.</p>
<h3>Wu Jianguang and Others Innocent</h3>
<p>Plaintiff, Defendants, and Lawyers for Both Sides</p>
<p>None of Them Appeared in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>The well-known blind man Wu Jianguang and others were accused by party member Yu Qingyu of using demagoguery to deceive the public and obtain money from them, and were reported to the Special District Local Court. This accusation was based on a novel argument, so it attracted considerable attention in society. The details of the trial have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was the date for the pronouncement of the verdict in the case. The plaintiff, Yu Qingyu, and the defendants, Wu Jianguang, Wang Yonghai, Wang Zhenhai, Chai Caigao, and Chai Caifa, all failed to appear in court. The lawyers for both sides also did not come to court. It was rumored that both parties had reached a settlement outside of court, which seems credible. Subsequently, Judge Feng took his seat and announced the judgment: The defendants Wu Jianguang and others are innocent.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Mail Can Still Be Sent Via the Beining Railway</h3>

<h3>Li Senfu Escapes Danger</h3>
<p>First Hidden in a Thatched Hut in Beixinjing</p>
<p>Then Moved to a Rural Area in the Sun Temple Township</p>
<p>Treatment in the Bandit's Den Was Not Bad</p>
<p>Li Only Managed to Escape and Return Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Li Senfu, manager of the Jiucheng Second Silk Reeling Factory in Rihuigang, Tapuqiao, Nanshi, was kidnapped on the morning of the 17th of this month at 7:00 AM while traveling from his home at No. 15 Xinyili, Xujiahui Road, to the factory in his own chauffeured car. Three kidnappers suddenly appeared and abducted Li without a trace. The details have been reported in this newspaper. We now learn that Li escaped from the bandit's den yesterday morning at 4:00 AM. It is said that after Li was kidnapped, he was directly hidden in a thatched hut in Beixinjing. The next evening, he was moved to a bungalow in the rural Sun Temple township in Zhabei. The house was surrounded by bamboo fences. He was treated well for the first two days, and on the first day, he was even served domino-brand ham and steamed chicken and other delicacies. The surveillance was not very strict, and he was not ordered to send a letter to his family. The bandits sent a letter directly to Li's residence and once contacted him in Tanziwan, Zhabei. The day before yesterday, Li's residence received another letter from the bandits, and the location was scheduled for negotiations on Wusong Road. Undercover detectives disguised themselves and went there, but after waiting all night, no one from the bandits came. At the same time, Li took advantage of the bandits' fatigue and sleep and escaped alone. He went to a friend's house first and returned home at 9:00 AM. He immediately moved his whole family away, leaving only two maids to guard the house.</p>
<h3>Mr. Sheng Shengchuan's Funeral Held Yesterday</h3>

At 7:30 AM, the procession departed from his residence. The funeral was solemn, and all vulgar customs were discarded except for those that were necessary. Therefore, along the way, there was only the sound of the military band leading the way, and the sound of the march and wheels of those attending the funeral. It was extremely solemn and mournful. Around 9:30 AM, they arrived at the Siming Public Cemetery in Rihuigang and completed the funeral arrangements. The guests left in succession. It is said that the Sheng residence will choose a date to send out invitations, and there will definitely be a grand scene of plain cars and white horses when the time comes.</p>

<h3>The Hull of the Sunken Kangtai Steamer Will Be Blown Up Today</h3>
<p>The evening newspaper reports that the Kangtai Steamer collided with the Italian ship Libya in the Wusongkou on March 26th of last year and sank. The Jianghai Customs and the Tokyo Salvage Company signed a contract to carry out the salvage work, which lasted for two months. This morning (the 23rd), according to the Mitsui Company, the resident manager of the company in Shanghai, all the items and equipment in the ship have been salvaged, but the hull is completely flooded and firmly embedded in the mud, making it difficult to lift. Moreover, carrying out this work will inevitably hinder ships entering the port. Therefore, it has been agreed with the Kangtai Steamer Company to destroy it with explosives, which is scheduled to be carried out on Thursday afternoon. The Kangtai Steamer Company only had this one ship, and it has ceased operations since it was sunk.</p>

<h3>Zhang Maocheng Rice Shop to Sell Rice at Cost</h3>
<p>Zhang Maocheng Rice Shop on Haining Road has always adhered to the principle of low profits and open business practices. It was the first to create a system of posted prices, which it has maintained for more than ten years. Now, considering the high rice prices and the difficult lives of the people, the owner has personally gone to various places to purchase rice, regardless of cost. Starting from July 25th of the lunar calendar, various types of rice will be sold at cost until rice prices stabilize.

Each stone weighs 200 pounds, and each person is limited to one stone. The hours are from 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily.</p>

Gu Houyi testified that the deceased was not careful when walking and that it had nothing to do with him. Prosecutor Guo then ordered Xie to sign a guarantee to collect the body for burial and stated that according to the police investigation, the incident was not the fault of the driver and that no prosecution should be initiated.

<h3>Extortion by Gangsters Continues Unabated</h3>
<p>Huge Sums Already Paid</p>
<p>Trying to Extort Again</p>
<p>Detectives Arrest Two</p>
<p>Admit to Extortion</p>
<p>Ni Baofu, the manager, and Tang Liangzhen, the assistant manager of the Sanyang South Goods Store on Nanjing Road, suddenly received a threatening letter with a bullet attached in June of last year, extorting money. Ni and others initially ignored it, but the gang was determined to get the money and continued to send threatening letters. Ni and others received more than twenty letters in total. Because they did not want to make an issue of it, they kept it secret and never announced it to the public. They only sent someone to contact the bandits and paid them seven times, totaling 746 yuan. The gang then stopped harassing them. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday afternoon, a tea server named Yu Ade from a certain hotel sent a letter to Sanyang, wanting Ni Baofu to receive it. However, Ni had already left Shanghai for the summer due to the hot weather. After the store staff read it, they realized that it was another letter from the threatening gang. They followed the instructions, put 100 yuan in banknotes into a longan package, and handed it back to Yu to take back. The store clerk Gui Quanxiang accompanied Yu to a room number 318 in the certain hotel. At that time, there was no one in the room. Gui also entered the room, saying that he had to wait for a face-to-face meeting. After a while, a man came in casually and turned around to leave after seeing Gui's face. Gui immediately chased after him and followed him to the vicinity of the Zhejiang Road vegetable market, where there was a Chinese police post number 1010. Gui called the police, who intercepted the escaping man and took him back to the Lao Zha Police Station. The man was identified as Kong Shaotang from Jiangning. Kong admitted that he wrote the letter and also named his accomplice Gu Weixin from Chongming, who was inside the Zikang South Goods Store at number 149 Ximen Road. The head of the patrol Liu Chunshu and Wang Shusen rushed to arrest Gu. Yesterday morning, he and Kong were handed over to the Special District Local Court. Judge Zhou brought them in for questioning. The police lawyer briefly described the case and requested a postponement because further investigation was needed. When questioned, Kong still admitted to writing the threatening letter, but Gu denied the crime. The court ordered Kong and Gu to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Announces Rules for Citizens' Use of Shoreline</h3>
<p>The municipal government announced yesterday the rules for citizens' use of shoreline, stating: "The Shanghai Municipal Government hereby promulgates the Rules for Citizens' Use of Shoreline. This is the order."</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Rules for Citizens' Use of Shoreline: Article 1: The waterline along the banks of all rivers in this city where ships are moored shall be called the "shoreline." Any tidal flats, whether filled or unfilled, shall not be considered part of the shoreline. Article 2: Anyone building a wharf or using the shoreline along the banks of any river in this city, regardless of whether the land or tidal flats are owned by the state, the city, private individuals, or leased, must apply to the Port Authority for a shoreline use permit. Article 3: Anyone applying for a shoreline use permit must provide the location, starting and ending points of the shoreline segment, the duration of use, and the purpose of the wharf in a written request to the Port Authority for approval. They must then find a reputable guarantor in this city and obtain a shoreline use permit and shoreline map from the Port Authority before using the shoreline. The format of the permit will be determined separately. The permit is of a long-term nature and does not need to be carried around during the Port Authority-approved period of use. Article 4: Anyone applying for a shoreline use permit must pay the following fees according to the regulations and obtain a receipt: (A) A one-time handling fee must be paid when applying for the permit: ten silver dollars for the Huangpu River shoreline, eight silver dollars for the Wusong River shoreline, and six silver dollars per year for other waterways. (B) Six months' shoreline usage fee must be prepaid, as well as a deposit equal to half of the shoreline usage fee. Article 5: The shoreline usage fee shall be collected according to the shoreline usage fee schedule established by the Municipal Government Property Evaluation Committee. In special circumstances, the Municipal Government may change the fee schedule at any time. Article 6: Shoreline users shall pay an annual usage fee, starting from the date of obtaining the shoreline usage permit. The fee shall be paid to the Port Authority in advance in two installments each year, and a receipt shall be obtained as proof of payment. If there are any arrears in payment, the deposit shall be deducted. If the deduction reaches one-half of the total deposit and the payment is still not made up, the right to use the shoreline shall be revoked, and the user shall be ordered to dismantle the wharf and other buildings completely, and the remaining deposit shall be returned. Article 7: The deposit will be refunded in full when the usage period expires, provided that there are no outstanding usage fees. Article 8: The duration of shoreline use shall be specified by the user at their discretion and submitted to the Port Authority for approval. Article 9: Shoreline users shall not transfer or sublet the permit or privately sublet part or all of the shoreline to others for use. Article 10: In addition to applying to the Public Works Bureau for a permit to build a wharf, shoreline users must first submit the length of the wharf extending into the water to the Port Authority for approval. Article 11: Any citizen who uses the shoreline without the approval of the Port Authority will, once discovered, be charged double the usage fee from the date of occupancy, and all buildings will be immediately ordered to be demolished. However, those who have already built wharves before the promulgation and implementation of these rules may apply to the Port Authority for a shoreline usage permit within one month after promulgation. Article 12: During the period of shoreline use, the Port Authority may increase the usage fee once every five years, based on the circumstances measured according to the shoreline usage fee schedule. However, the increase shall not exceed 20% of the original usage fee each time, and the user shall be notified three months in advance. Article 13: Upon receiving notification of an increase in the usage fee, shoreline users shall submit their original permit to the Port Authority for endorsement. Article 14: Repairs to embankments, dredging of mud and sand, and related expenses shall be the responsibility of the shoreline user, but they must be approved by the competent authority before construction can begin. Article 15: If a shoreline user is unable to continue paying fees due to business setbacks during the period of use, they may request the Port Authority to return the permit and cancel the right to use the shoreline, but they must pay another six months' usage fee from the date of the request. Article 16: The original shoreline user shall have the priority right to apply for a continued permit within one month after the expiration of the usage period. If the request is not continued after the deadline, the wharf and other buildings shall be dismantled, and the shoreline shall be returned. However, if the Municipal Government needs it, it may purchase the shoreline at an appraised price with the consent of the original user. Article 17: If a shoreline user uses the wharf for illegal activities or activities that harm the public interest, the Port Authority may revoke the permit at any time and confiscate the deposit. If there are any outstanding usage fees, the guarantor may be pursued for payment. Article 18: If it is necessary to use the leased shoreline for municipal facilities, such as the construction of public wharves, the Port Authority may recover all or part of the shoreline and revoke or change the permit. The wharf built by the user shall be jointly appraised by both parties, and the Port Authority shall fund the purchase. Article 19: These rules may be amended at any time if there are any omissions. Article 20: These rules shall be implemented from the date of promulgation by the Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>Mortality Statistics of American Automobile Accidents</h3>
<p>According to a recent report released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, automobile accidents in the United States have been increasing year by year. In 1929, a total of 31,000 people died in automobile accidents across the country, and approximately one million men, women, and children were injured. In total, 83,000 people died in automobile accidents in the two years from 1927 to 1929. From 1920 to 1929, a total of 190,850 people died. Based on a standard of 100,000 people, the accident mortality rate in 1920 was 16%, which increased to 27% in 1929 and to 93% this year. According to these results, the number of accident deaths is quickly approaching the rate of car increase.</p>
<p>The causes of this are (1) driver negligence, (2) poor road maintenance, (3) dim streetlights, (4) pedestrian carelessness, and (5) the development of commerce. The resulting death toll exceeds the number of American deaths during the European War. Moreover, the economic losses caused by automobile accidents in 1929 alone amounted to no less than 850 million. If we observe the number of casualties in the first four months of this year, the number will certainly increase compared to last year. The government has no good way to prevent this, and can only hope to pay attention to driving safety. (Yi Kang)</p>
<h3>The Amount of Polluted Air Absorbed by New York City Residents</h3>
<p>According to a report from the New York City Department of Health's Chemical Experiment Laboratory, the air is best at 4:00 AM and worst after 9:00 AM. Based on one million residents in busy streets near Central Park, each person absorbs an average of 1.35 pounds of polluted air every 15 minutes. Therefore, from January 11th to 27th of this year alone, the degree of unclean air ranged from 27% pounds to 2.7 pounds. To prevent and test the degree of air cleanliness, municipal authorities have decided to install dust-collecting paper outside each window. The paper will have 96 grids, and the degree of dust, etc., will be measured according to the weight and quality of the dust collected on the paper. It is expected that this result will be a great help in measuring the mortality rate of citizens in the future. (Yi Kang)</p>
<h3>World Silver Production is Fourteen Times Greater Than Gold</h3>
<p>According to a survey published by the U.S. Department of Mines, the world's silver production from 1493 to 1927 totaled 14,000,000,000 ounces, which is fourteen times more than the gold produced in the same period. This amount of silver could pave Broadway in New York City from Battery Park to Central Park (over four miles) to a height of six inches. From 1493 to 1600, the world produced 747,000,000 ounces of silver. From 1601 to 1700, the world produced 1,272,000,000 ounces of silver. From 1701 to 1800, the world produced 1,833,000,000 ounces of silver. This amount is still less than the amount produced from 1919 to 1927. From 1493 to 1880, the world produced 3,852,000,000 ounces of silver. This amount is still less than the amount produced from 1909 to 1927. More silver has been produced since 1888 than was produced from 1493 to 1887. In other words, the amount produced in 396 years is less than the amount produced in the last 39 years.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Reviews</p>
<h3>"Our Generation" by Xia Zhongfang</h3>
<p>The books and newspapers reviewed in this publication are all published works. Today, I will make an exception and introduce a collection of poems that has not yet been published.</p>
<p>Both old and new Chinese literature have reached a state of decline, especially poetry, which has recently experienced a slump. The most accurate criticism from the Vanguard Weekly is that the literary world lacks a central consciousness. This is a very accurate assessment.</p>
<p>Poetry has always been considered the most beautiful flower in literature, so literature that lacks poetry is a sign of its decline. In the declining Chinese literary world, we have found a very good collection of poems, and the works in this collection all have a central consciousness. Therefore, I cannot wait for the poetry collection to be published and will introduce it first.</p>
<p>The first poem I want to introduce is "Our Generation" by Fang Guangming.</p>
<p>Sisters and brothers,</p>
<p>We are only fifteen or sixteen years old,</p>
<p>We all have strong bodies,</p>
<p>We all have unlimited courage,</p>
<p>Our China, the rivers and mountains are beautiful,</p>
<p>We young people, unite together,</p>
<p>Sisters and brothers, encourage each other,</p>
<p>Sisters and brothers, encourage each other,</p>
<p>Our great-grandparents often sighed,</p>
<p>For the decline of the Chinese people's livelihood,</p>
<p>Our fathers, our mothers,</p>
<p>Often shed tears for the decline of the nation,</p>
<p>Their era has passed,</p>
<p>Now it is our generation,</p>
<p>We will strive, following one after another,</p>
<p>Overthrow all international tyranny,</p>
<p>We love and protect the Chinese nation,</p>
<p>The glory of the nation will never be replaced,</p>
<p>Look, the national flag of the blue sky and white sun,</p>
<p>Sways in the wind today,</p>
<p>After reading this poem, we truly feel a bright future ahead of us. The "our generation" mentioned in the poem is not the generation of the person writing this review, nor the generation of the author, but refers to the next generation. Our generation is truly too pitiful. We are responsible for all the suffering and all the darkness. We hope that our next generation will not be as corrupt and degenerate as our generation.</p>
<p>Our author proactively, enthusiastically, and optimistically anticipates the situation of our next generation, stimulating us to work hard and sweep away the morbid and nauseating poems that were once considered interesting. This is truly worthy of everyone singing. Now, let us introduce another poem by the same author, "Welcome Forward."</p>
<p>Brothers, charge forward,</p>
<p>We are the vanguard of the Chinese nation,</p>
<p>Welcome forward, welcome forward,</p>
<p>Eliminate all reactionary forces that harm the nation,</p>
<p>Brothers, charge forward,</p>
<p>Break through the multiple oppressions of the great powers,</p>
<p>Welcome forward, welcome forward,</p>
<p>For the independence and prosperity of the nation,</p>
<p>Brothers, charge forward,</p>
<p>Let us show our bravery,</p>
<p>Welcome forward, welcome forward,</p>
<p>Our cause is grand and glorious,</p>
<p>We feel that in this chaotic and declining era of Chinese literature, it is appropriate to have a bolt from the blue to awaken the literary figures who are short-sighted, blindly crashing around, and locking themselves in ivory towers. At the same time, the people of the whole country also need such bright and passionate poems to inspire them. It is said that these songs are already being set to music by music composers. We hope that the sheet music can also be released soon for all the youth of China to sing together. Fang Jun's many songs, as well as the works of other authors, all have a consistent central idea, and the words and tones are all a new world in the poetry world. However, this review has already been written too long and cannot be written any further. Fortunately, the poetry collection will be printed soon, and everyone can sing their hearts out.</p>
<h3>Oath Increases</h3>
<p>By Chen Bocui</p>
<p>Of course, the Chinese poetry scene has recently been pitifully silent. The main reason for this unfavorable phenomenon is that most poets are engaged in "crude and shoddy work" and "senseless moaning," losing the principle of poetry as the highest expression of art. We feel that the unusual decline of the Chinese poetry scene is not worth lamenting. Many young poets think that writing poetry is merely a kind of literary pastime, simply moaning sadly, instead of consciously creating great poems as works of art for appreciation. Regarding this, we hold immense pessimism about the future of Chinese poetry, and also feel a chill regarding the future of young Chinese poets.</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt once said, "Poetry is the expression of passion for truth, beauty, and power. It concretizes its concepts, uses imagination, and adjusts language to fit the principle of diverse and unified rhythm." Applying these words to Chinese poets, it seems that very few can bear the weight without shame. Can humming a few lines about flowers, the moon, and gentle breezes while sitting on a lover's lap, or writing some senseless, seemingly poetic lines while lying on a sofa in a coffee shop, be considered poetry?</p>
<p>Recently, I read Chen Bocui's poem "Oath." Objectively, I feel that his poem reveals the expression of truth, beauty, and power between each line, giving me a new impression that I cannot find in other poetry collections. Whether Mr. Hunt's words can be borne by Mr. Chen or not, I certainly dare not be assertive. At least, I resolutely acknowledge that Mr. Chen's small "Oath" is a mature collection of poems.</p>
<p>In terms of quantity, it is certainly not a grand spectacle. One can finish reading the entire collection in under ten minutes with a quiet mind. Originally, there were many cases abroad where a single great poem caused a sensation in the entire literary world, so</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>we should only pay attention to the quality of the poems, and the quantity of poems will not hinder the content of the poem. Chen's "Oath" only includes "Hesitation," "Night Walker," "I Feel Light All Over," "The Evening Breeze Blows Your White Dress," "You Must Not Have," "Oath," "I Say Goodbye to You," "I Visited My Lover's Home Today," "I Often Want to Think Like This," "Just See You Again," "The Moon is So Bright," and "Grave Door of Love," a total of twelve poems. Each poem, of course, has its independence and its own style. After reading them, it is as if we first eat jujubes and then suddenly taste the deliciousness of fresh lychees. Although the things eaten are different, the beauty of the taste has a consistent unity. That is to say, the style of the poem can be created by the author's artistic skills, but the different styles expressed all represent the author himself. Readers can easily feel a new excitement after reading, and singing it has a special interest, without feeling tired after reading at all, just wanting to read it continuously. A poem that can absorb the reader's heart is undoubtedly a poem worth singing again and again. If these twelve poems are combined in order, it is an extremely perfect long poem, and also the "oath" issued by the author to a woman.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the different styles expressed in the author's poems.</p>
<p>I say goodbye to you,</p>
<p>"I'm leaving."</p>
<p>You close your mouth tightly,</p>
<p>Do not answer,</p>
<p>Ah, you close your mouth tightly,</p>
<p>Do not answer,</p>
<p>I say goodbye to you,</p>
<p>"I'm leaving." (I Say Goodbye to You)</p>
<p>My heart is just afraid,</p>
<p>Your house is dark and big, but also quaint,</p>
<p>Hanging a few calligraphy and paintings, the bottle is also inserted with wintersweet,</p>
<p>My heart is just afraid, (I Visited My Lover's Home Today using this format to write poetry can be said to be the author's creation. The words and sentences are extremely ordinary. In fact, this ordinariness contains a clear and simple beauty that other poets cannot write. In terms of rhythm, the author is also very attentive, but it also tends to be natural and not contrived, and often uses the same words for rhyme. This is also the author's unique creation.</p>
<p>The author also has a Nietzschean world-weary color. Because of unrequited love, in the poem "Love's Tomb Door," there is such an ending, "Just in this," this dim moonlight dusk, I am going, going to knock on the tomb door of love." This actually represents the author's own conclusion about love. Actually, entering the "Love's Tomb Door" is still hypocrisy and emptiness. Originally, love is essentially such a thing. In this point, the author is only passive, and will not conclusively solve the only direction after unrequited love is how. If you want to obtain the true fruit of love, it is definitely not something that can be seen by entering the "Love's Tomb Door". I believe that the author must strive to move forward in the future, and do not think that losing love means sacrificing everything of your own. Obviously, sacrificing everything of your own will not get a corresponding price. This is just that the author has not obtained an upward central consciousness, which of course does not have the slightest hindrance to the essence of the poem.</p>
<p>In terms of skills, there is no need to say that the author has achieved an unusual success. Each poem expresses a rare maturity. If the author can work hard to promote the poetry of the Chinese national spirit, and write it down in this style containing clear and simple beauty, and instill it into the folk, it will definitely achieve amazing results. At the same time, I dare to believe that the author's writing will definitely be greater than the so-called unrequited love poems that have been published now, because the author also has considerable research on children's poetry, and a little bit can be seen in the "Oath" collection of poems, otherwise, the author's poems will not have such natural rhythms and clear understanding in every poem.</p>
<p>On the recent extremely lonely poetry scene in China, the discovery of such a collection of poems is indeed worthy of our attention. Now, I have only written down what I felt after reading this collection of poems and introduced it to the readers. I believe you will also be sympathetic.</p>
