<h3>江大足球賽光華勝復旦</h3>
<p>二與一之比</p>
<p>｜大學生賽球用武｜可嘆！</p>
<p>江大體育協會之足球錦標昨日復旦與光華兩校在江灣補賽劇戰結果光華以二比一勝雙方竟演出武劇觀者多爲兩校同學光華雖路途遙遠亦有九汽車人往觀而發生打架之動機亦即此九汽車人爲肇端光華球員奚某每爲主要份子年來大學足球程度雖稱提高而大學生之習氣竟不能改每届比賽動輒打武如此粗野曷勝浩歎</p>
<p>上半時中光華奚巧生得楊人偉之傳遞攻入復旦一球當競争之時復旦一球員沿邊跌在光華看客身上光華同學即揮拳而打同學光華球員奚巧生亦上前助毆復旦同學之啦啦隊即上前排解三二分鐘後始告平静但從此比賽進行中時見打架之事發生矣</p>
<p>下半時起復旦聲勢極盛球常在光華門前復旦曾得二次罰十二碼球之機會惜均未中反又被光華奚巧生攻入一球復旦力圖報復右翼李琳傳中余順章用頭頂入一球結果遂成二比一光華勝裁判員何春輝在下半時中雙方球員衝突時見而光華張長江及復旦余顧章况扭住大打裁判員即將二人取消資格光華奚巧生因係動武之主故在下半時中被復旦多人看牢極少活動之機會</p>

<h3>怎樣去紀念肇和舉羲？</h3>
<p>肇和軍艦的幾聲大礮算是間接把袁世凱　死了討袁的戰役是集合國内許多的革命勢力去拚一個叛國有大奸雄總算把他拚掉了但袁世凱的游魂現在依然在國内縱横猖獗而且經他幾年間權術操縱弄得全國人廉恥掃地國家元氣　喪得乾乾净净帝制餘孽到如今尚未得完全消滅如閻逆錫山便是彰明較著的一個當時袁氏稱帝閻逆首先勸進大爲袁逆所激賞曾封他爲一等侯爵像這種寡廉鮮恥的軍閥早就該不爲國人所齒尚復興兵倡亂破壞統一這都是袁逆遺留的毒害所以紀念肇和戰役應澈底肅清一切封建的餘孽</p>
<p>復次肇和舉義所要殲滅的對象爲袁逆世凱而袁逆之帝制自爲主觀上是由於他的　視國人野心太大但客觀上實由當時人民多存已治已安的幻夢不作求治求安的建設且成功之黨人竟違棄初志連革命的主義也不需要以爲總理的理想太高致總理竟説出（余非由畏勢力而辭總毁乃由不能行革命之建設而辭總統）的傷心話我們紀念肇和舉義應該確認民國成立後十餘年間軍閥循環的禍亂全由於不能堅信總理的主義政策不奉行總理的革命方略而得到的必然的結果博大精深的總理遺教實在是救國建國的惟一途徑是絶業不容忽視的</p>
<p>從此可知本黨的三民主義是革命救國的唯一良方在民國以前本黨本主義以創造民國民國之後則黨本主義以捍衛民國和建設民國凡是存心破壞民國如袁世凱那一流的人物都是本黨的公敵结果未有不遭失敗的年來因龍叛逆常常發生致建設事業因之而進行遲慢今後訓政工作的進行能否暢遂總理的遣志能否於最短時間實現全看搗亂民國破壞和平統一的一般封建餘孽能否於最短期間斷絶根株凡我全國同志同胞今天紀念肇和舉義應當一致認識國家處境的艱難體念革命艱苦的環境更認識此次討逆的勝利實爲三民主義的勝利本先烈攬護民國的精神和熱忱贊助本黨政府根本剷除反動呌一切袁世凱的游魂餘氣不再在中華民國的國土中作祟而後國家才能眞正統一才有永久平和</p>
<p>標語（一）肇和舉義是反抗帝制維護民國的奮門（二）肇和舉義是本黨先烈救國精神的表現（三）肇和舉義是承斷辛亥革命之精神（四）肇和舉義是促進雲南起義之先聲（五）肇和舉義是民主勢力舉專制餘孽的門争（六）肇放舉義殉難先烈是中華民國的維護者（七）發揚肇和舉義維護民國的精神殲滅封建反動勢力（八）紀念肇和舉義要鞏固黨國基礎促進訓政建設（九）紀念肇和舉義要嚴懲破壞統一背叛中内之閻馮諸逆（十）紀念肇和要舉義要保障永久和平發揚中華國光</p>

<p>焦山要人多　張氏未到前葉主席及各廳廳長預乘大雅发巡艦至焦山守候焦山遠在江心遊者輒感涉水爲難故平日遊屐罕至寂冷凄清確是深山本色此次軍政要人集中名刹益以往觀者之參加焦山直是閙山矣</p>

<h3>大夏女生宿舍開放</h3>
<p>— 澤湘</p>
<p>女生宿舍開放已成本埠各大學的慣例我們大夏的女生宿舍久有西宫之稱當然不在例外開放的故事已經幾次的舉行本期學生會亦照例去函女生同學會請其擇期開放籍作清潔運動據女生同學覆函定於十一月二十六日上午九時起下午四時止女生宿舍開放等語同時女生同學會亦在女生宿舍貼出佈告云本舍定於十一月二十六日開放希各同學房略加修飾整理以資精潔而將觀瞻等語於是女同學忙於整理佈置男女學亦皆忙於修理服裝直自是日上午九時起至下午四時止校道上的往返同學緒繹不絶宿舍内男女同學熙熙撓撓交相談語亦間有爲其至友略備水菓茶點者一塲盛况至晚始告平息</p>
<h3>羣英齋開放記</h3>
<p>— 武</p>
<p>大夏妇生宿舍在十一月二十六日開放了</p>
<p>自入秋以來各大學的女生宿舍大都接二連三的開放過大夏的女生宿舍當然也不是例外了談到大夏女生的宿舍起初在膠州路時名之日西宫好像和復理的東宫對峙着也曾開放過兩次今秋大夏梵王渡的新校舍落成了又新築了一座女生宿舍西臨西訶和麗娃麗妲村南面可以看到蘇州河東邊就是滬杭火車道和聖約翰大學的校舍在此環境中學校當局名之日（羣英齋）讀者看到此地不要和（君芳齋）武（羣芳大會）混起來那麽對於我們的女生式是宫主有悔辱和輕視的意義若從全校的校舍看起來女生宿舍是住於南面也可稱之曰（南宫）但是這名詞也不怎樣普遍所以我們仍可沿用（西宫）的名字</p>
<p>在二十六日上午九時至十一時半下半一時至五時是開放的時間一般問來没有進過宫門的人趨之若驚所以向羣英齋走一條馬路上充滿了男同學好似（山陰道上）的盛况在宫的前面有一曲流水上面架了一座木橋有人説這座橋可以稱爲鵲橋但是已經過了七夕有人説這座橋是區别男女生的界限的可以名之曰（陰陽橋）依我看來在失戀的朋友們也可稱此橋爲（奈何橋）了過了橋就經過古柏夾道和冬青樹的馬路（現在的情形）走不上十幾步就到了宫門了</p>
<p>進了宫門一邊是門房正面就是會客室靠窗的一邊掛了窗幃靠過道一邊掛了大的印花的幕在此範圍中有好幾張滕的桌子和篠椅子分佈着供會客之用她們平時會客的時間晚上九點鐘停止會客的人尤以晚間爲多那時燈光朦瓏晴語綿綿印花的布幕或許爲此而設</p>
<p>開放的那一天由女學生會的派定每層樓有六位招待路經是左上右下最下一層在左面是幼稚園右邊是飯堂和閲報室等那不值得我們的注意我們仍要看的是二贈樓和三層樓的宿舍了她們宿舍的佈置從表面看來是比男生佈置得好每一房間住二個人進門的時候門旁西面有二個衣櫉是裝在墻裏的供給她們放衣服其他每人一桌一床一橙因爲各人審美的眼光不同所以佈置也就名異了幼稚師範班的學生的房裏大槪有許多形藝和工藝的圖畫善於所交的女生的房裏自已的照片很多信仰基督教的女生的房裏掛了聖母的畫片其他房間也有掛花紙的或是西洋畫的書籍方面讀同學的女生書藉大槪比其他的人多些也許因爲開放的關係都收拾起來了麽床是每人一張鋼架裝木板的床上面的佈置和被蓋等大槪是白色也有其他的顔色床的方位隨各人的佈置而立但是有少數的床相連着那大槪是例外了（女生宿舍是凹字式凹口向南向南的房間内充滿了陽光因爲加上了佈置較向陰的房間更爲美麗清潔了）</p>

<h3>Central Political Council Decides to Reorganize the National Government</h3>
<p>The Four Newly Appointed Ministers Remain the Same</p>
<p>Resolution Passed on Beining Railway Public Bonds</p>
<p>Nanjing, Morning of the 3rd - The Central Political Council held a meeting at 8:00 AM in the Central First Conference Hall. Central Political Council members in Nanjing, including Yu Youren, Wang Chonghui, Dai Chuanxian, Hu Hanmin, Zhang Xueliang, Chiang Kai-shek, and alternate members Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, etc., all attended. The grand occasion was unprecedented in over a year. Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang arrived early, and the meeting started on time. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek first had Zhang Xueliang report on the diplomatic, political, and economic situation in the Northeast, lasting forty minutes. He spoke earnestly about the difficult situation of the Northeast being caught between Japan and Russia, expressing a deep hope to end internal strife, improve politics, and jointly resist foreign aggression. The entire atmosphere was extremely solemn. Next, regarding the revised National Government Organization Law, it was proposed that the heads of the various specially appointed ministries and committees should be reappointed. The chairman proposed that Wang Zhengting remain as Minister of Foreign Affairs, He Yingqin as Minister of Military Affairs, Wang Boqun as Minister of Transportation, Sun Ke as Minister of Railways, Song Ziwen as Minister of Finance, Zhang Renjie as Chairman of the Construction Committee, and Zhang Zhijiang as Chairman of the Opium Suppression Committee. It was specially appointed that Kong Xiangxi would be the Minister of Industry, which was to merge Agriculture, Mining, and Commerce into the Ministry of Industry. Jiang Menglin's resignation as Minister of Education was approved, and Gao Lu, the ambassador to France, was appointed to succeed him. Niu Yongjian, Minister of Interior, was transferred to the Ministry of Personnel of the Examination Yuan, with Liu Shangqing succeeding him. It was also decided to dispatch Chen Qicai to prepare for the Directorate-General of Budget, and the Ministry of Health was reorganized into the National Health Administration, subordinate to the Executive Yuan, with Liu Ruiheng remaining as the Director-General.

<p>Nanjing - During the Central Political Council meeting, the Economic Group and the Finance Group reported on the review of the plan to purchase locomotives for the Beining Railway and issue short-term equipment bonds.

It was proposed that the plan be approved in principle and that the draft regulations be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The resolution was passed. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Population Statistics of Various Countries</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that France's birth and death statistics showed that the number of deaths exceeded the number of births this year, with the exception of certain provinces in the north and Alsace-Lorraine, the number of births decreased. According to British census statistics, the population of England and Wales increased by 70,000 in the twelve months ending at the end of September. Today, according to the announcement by the Japanese Statistics Bureau, the national population increased by 132,579 from January to June of this year, 18,339 more than in the same period last year. The reason is that infant mortality has sharply decreased. Of the three countries, France, England, and Japan, only France has slightly decreased, while England and Japan have both increased sharply. The Associated Press once investigated the fertility rate of the whole of Europe, saying that although the population temporarily decreased sharply after the European War, it is now continuing to increase. Italy is the most prominent in its advancement, and England and Russia are also increasing day by day. According to the investigation, the reason for the previous decrease was that the national economy declined after the war, and the country could not spend more funds to encourage production, and that the people lived too closely and there were too many unemployed, so many people migrated abroad. Seeing this situation, the governments of various countries were concerned about the weakening of the race, so they devoted themselves to encouraging production on the one hand, and paying attention to protecting infants to reduce their mortality rate on the other. Now that this has been achieved, it cannot be said that it is not a gratifying thing. However, according to this trend of increasing production, there will be a worry of overpopulation in the future. After overpopulation, there is no place to live in the country and no work to do, so they will have to seek emigration abroad. However, other countries also feel the pain of overpopulation and will strictly reject these foreign immigrants, and international disputes will arise. Today, countries with large populations have already encountered this kind of difficulty, and the immigration problem has become a serious problem at present. It is said that the increasing number of unemployed people in various countries cannot maintain their lives, which is enough to leave hidden worries for world peace. If we add the result of overpopulation, what will these worries be like? This is a problem that must be paid attention to today.</p>
<h3>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>Nanjing - The list of special secretaries for each group of the Central Political Council has been decided by the joint meeting of each group on the 2nd. It was originally scheduled to be submitted to the Central Political Council for discussion on the 3rd, but due to time constraints, it was not submitted and has been rescheduled for discussion at next week's Central Political Council. Special dispatch on the 3rd.</p>
<p>Nanjing - Zhang Xueliang reported to the Central Political Council on the morning of the 3rd on the history and current situation of education, finance, military affairs, diplomacy, commerce, industry, textiles, and the bean industry in the Northeast in great detail. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Nanjing - The "Review Opinion on the Preliminary Issues of the Family Law" and the "Review Opinion on the Preliminary Issues of the Inheritance Law" passed by the Central Political Council last time have been sent to the Legislative Yuan for drafting in accordance with the regulations. The Legislative Yuan has completed the drafting and submitted it to the 120th meeting for discussion. Among them, regarding the limits of marriage restrictions for collateral relatives, the Central Political Council passed the original proposal, Item 5: "Marriage restrictions for relatives: The following relatives may not marry: (2) Collateral blood relatives and collateral relatives by marriage who are not of the same generation, but this restriction does not apply to collateral blood relatives beyond the seventh degree of kinship and collateral relatives by marriage beyond the fifth degree of kinship; (3) Collateral blood relatives who are not of the same generation but are within the sixth degree of kinship, but this restriction does not apply to cousins." The Legislative Yuan Fang Nan believed that it should be expanded and specially sent a letter to the Central Political Council proposing that those collateral blood relatives who are not of the same generation should not be subject to marriage restrictions beyond the degree of kinship, and that collateral blood relatives who are of the same generation should still be subject to marriage restrictions within the eighth degree of kinship. Although this is a slight expansion compared to the standards set in the preliminary issues of relatives, it seems that it can be implemented in accordance with the spirit of marriage restrictions for relatives. The Central Political Council has already submitted this case for discussion on the morning of the 3rd, and the result was a resolution to pass it according to the opinion of the Legislative Yuan. (Special Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Both the Kinship and Inheritance Sections</h3>
<p>Scheduled to hold the final meeting today</p>
<p>Nanjing - The Legislative Yuan continued to meet from 3:00 PM to 9:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd to discuss the draft of the Kinship and Inheritance sections of the Civil Code. Because the Kinship section had already been passed in the second reading on the 2nd, only the Inheritance section was discussed today. Thirty-nine people attended, and Hu Hanmin presided over the meeting. The debate was not very intense, and there were not many amendments. It was completely passed in the second reading, and then both the Kinship and Inheritance sections were submitted for the third reading and completely passed. They will be submitted to the government for promulgation immediately. The term of office of the first session of the Legislative Yuan has expired, and it is scheduled to hold the final meeting on the afternoon of the 4th to discuss the unfinished cases. The members of the next session must be decided by the Central Political Council for reappointment, but there will still be 49 people.

<h3>Special Features of Inheritance in the Draft Civil Code</h3>
<p>Nanjing - Both the Kinship and Inheritance sections of the Civil Code have been passed in the third reading on the 3rd. The special features of the Inheritance section are detailed below:</p>
<p>(A) Inheritance of property is not based on ancestral inheritance. In addition to direct lineal descendants, spouses, parents, siblings, and grandparents all have the right to inherit. (B) Division of statutory and designated inheritance rights. The former includes direct lineal descendants, parents, siblings, and grandparents in addition to the spouse. The latter must be designated only when there are no direct lineal descendants, regardless of gender. (C) Equality of inheritance between men and women. Women, whether married or unmarried, have the right to inherit. The direct lineal descendants in this law include women. (D) Establishing the inheritance rights of spouses. The interests of spouses are deeply intertwined, so regardless of gender, they have the right to inherit each other's property. (E) Establishing the approval of limited inheritance. The heir may limit the repayment of the deceased's debts to the property inherited. If it is not a limited inheritance or an inheritance that has not been abandoned first, the heir shall still be fully responsible for the repayment of the deceased's debts. (F) Defining the form of wills into five types: handwritten, notarized, sealed, written on behalf of, and oral. (G) Provisions on special reserved property. Although personal property may be freely disposed of, the special reserved property enjoyed by relatives as stipulated by law is absolutely unaffected. Direct lineal descendants, parents, and spouses share one-half of the inheritable share, and siblings and grandparents share one-third. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<h3>International Telecommunications Negotiations</h3>
<p>Three Companies' Part to Continue Discussion Today</p>
<p>No Rescheduled Date for Sino-Japanese Part</p>
<p>Nanjing - The Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations and the meeting on the abolition of the submarine cable contract between the Datong, Dabe, and Pacific three companies continued to be held at the Ministry of Communications on the 3rd. The Chinese side attending the Sino-Japanese part was Zhuang Zhihuan and Wu Nanru, and the Japanese side was Keisaburo Yoshino. The Shanghai-Nagasaki and other five branch lines were all proposed for discussion at the same time. The main attendees on the Chinese side of the three companies' part were Wei Yiyi, Sha Shuyun, He Zhuanru, and Guo Shishuo, and those on the Datong side were Delot and Pengsheng, on the Dabe side were Shi Wensheng, and on the Pacific side was Ding Gan. The two points of increasing report fees and receiving and sending rights were brought up for discussion. After a long period of discussion, opinions differed and no agreement was reached. The three companies' part is scheduled to continue the meeting on the 4th. No date has been set for the continuation of the Sino-Japanese part. The reasons for the delay and inability to progress in these negotiations are: (1) Because China's international radio station is in its initial stage of establishment and has not yet shown sufficient effectiveness, there is still a concept of patent monopoly for the submarine cable. (2) The other parties are mutually watching and secretly colluding, and are unwilling to easily give up the rights they have obtained in China. (3) China owes more than 250,000 pounds in cable debt, which is equivalent to about 4,780,000 Chinese currency, and has not yet been repaid. Now, the Ministry of Communications, in order to resolutely recover sovereignty, is actively expanding the facilities of international radio stations to improve efficiency in order to gain domestic and international trust. On the one hand, it is carrying out a telecommunications public bond to advance funds, and on the other hand, it is ordering the Post Office Savings and Remittance Bureau to find ways to raise funds for the repayment of various cable debts, so as to avoid being used as an excuse by the other party, resulting in the failure of the negotiations to proceed smoothly.

<h3>Yan's Whereabouts Extremely Mysterious</h3>

Hereafter, I hope that the government will do its best to help the academic research of your society. Then, Zhao Naichuan gave a speech, saying that the Ministry of Education is currently holding a unification of scientific translation names and the compilation of university course standards.

<h3>German Parliament Reopens</h3>
<p>The opposition has a strong force.</p>
<p>The Social Democratic Party holds the balance.</p>
<p>The proposals of the two splinter parties contradict each other.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, February 3rd - The focus of attention at today's resumption of the Reichstag is the opposition's proposal against the government's financial plan. The opposition's strength is growing, as the Landbund has also joined the attack on the government. The opposition parties together hold 268 seats, consisting of the National Socialist Party, the three groups of the Nationalist Party, the Economic Party, the Landbund, and the Communist Party. The parties supporting the government hold only 165 seats. The 143 seats held by the Social Democratic Party are the key to the current political crisis. However, it is generally expected that the Social Democratic Party does not want the cabinet to collapse. Although the current opposition trend is strong, it is believed that the current term can be safely navigated.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, February 2nd - The National Socialist Party presented two motions in the Reichstag: one to withdraw the President's order to implement the financial plan, and the other to correct the constitutional position of the Bruning cabinet and provide it with the necessary basis for existence, with the Reichstag expressing confidence in the cabinet. These two proposals contradict each other, so it is expected that if the first proposal is rejected when the Reichstag meets, the second proposal will not need to be advanced.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, February 2nd - The Foreign Affairs Committee of the German Parliament today passed several debatable motions: one proposed by the Nationalist Party requesting the cabinet to devise necessary measures to ensure that the German people who suffered losses during the Polish elections receive appropriate compensation; another motion by the National Socialist Party requested the government to temporarily not approve the German-Polish clearing agreement and to suspend German-Polish trade negotiations. There was also another motion by the National Socialist Party requesting the withdrawal of the German official representative in the Geneva Disarmament Preparatory Committee and replacement with an observer, because the majority of countries in the committee refused to fulfill their disarmament obligations. Although the government does not necessarily have to follow these motions after they are submitted to and passed by the general assembly, it should recognize public opinion and treat it as a guide for policy implementation.</p>
<h3>US Government Budget</h3>
<p>Hoover Presents to Congress</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, February 2nd - President Hoover's government budget was submitted to the short-term meeting of Congress today. In the budget, Mr. Hoover proposes a total budget of $3,932,841,420 for this fiscal year. If this number is followed, it will be $221,000,000 more than the total military expenditure. According to Mr. Hoover's intention, the additional government expenditure for this year will be $100,000,000 more than last year, which will be used for the Farmers Bureau, $110,000,000 for the relief of American veterans, and $33,000,000 for the shipbuilding department. Mr. Hoover's total annual government expenditure is still short of $108,000,000, but the government's economic situation is consolidated.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, February 2nd - Two bills of considerable interest were introduced in Congress today. Republican Senator Borah introduced a bill to completely prohibit the import of Russian goods. Williamson, Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, proposed combining the three departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force into a Department of Defense, with one cabinet member as the minister.</p>
<p>Associated Press, New York, February 2nd - After President Hoover's annual report to Congress was released, the market showed improvement, and prices rose slightly.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, February 2nd - The police, in view of yesterday's demonstration by the Communist Party in front of Congress, patrolled the square around Congress with guns today, not daring to relax. The Party Bureau feared that the Communist Party would adopt a more violent strategy than yesterday, so it ordered the police reserve to be on standby at all times and to carry tear gas bombs to deal with the violent crowd.</p>
<h3>The German Proposal at the Disarmament Preparatory Conference is Rejected</h3>
<p>Advocating the Prohibition of Tanks and Heavy Artillery as Weapons of War</p>
<p>Only the Russian Representative Voted in Favor</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, February 2nd - Today, the Disarmament Preparatory Committee rejected the German proposal to ban heavy artillery, tanks, and other powerful weapons by a vote of ten to two. Besides Germany, only Soviet Russia voted in favor. The next item on the agenda was the British motion to extend the ban on poison gas, banning all poison gas, whether lethal or not. Representatives from Japan, France, and Italy spoke in favor. The United States, because it wanted to use tear gas for police to maintain order, strongly opposed it. As a result, the decision was postponed for further discussion. Next, it was decided to remove the clause on civil aviation from the draft disarmament convention, but the motions of France, Britain, and Japan will be submitted to the general assembly for discussion on whether civil aviation has weapon capabilities, and then suggestions will be made to the general assembly. The German representative then lodged a formal protest, stating that since merchant ships are not considered reserve warships and reserve soldiers are not restricted, it is absurd and unreasonable to consider civil aircraft as reserve weapons. Furthermore, by a vote of fourteen to , the German motion to convene the final disarmament conference on November 5th next year was rejected. At that time, besides Germany, only Russia, Italy, and Bulgaria voted in favor. When the British representative refuted the German representative's claim in the name of public opinion, the two sides debated fiercely. At that time, representatives from Greece, Czechoslovakia, and France supported the British representative, while representatives from China, Italy, and Bulgaria supported the German representative. Reuters, London, February 2nd - The British representative, Cecil, stated at the Geneva Disarmament Preparatory Committee today that he had received instructions from the British government to allow the principle of naval tonnage transfer, but only up to a total tonnage of 10,000 tons. Furthermore, the tonnage can only be transferred to surface warships, not submarines. Also, the transferred tonnage must not exceed the total tonnage set by the disarmament conference.</p>
<h3>Australian Governance Realized</h3>
<p>Opening a New Era of British Constitution</p>
<p>Reuters, London, February 2nd - Sir Isaac Isaacs's appointment as Governor-General of Australia is an important constitutional change in the relationship between Britain and its dominions. The Governors-General of the dominions were previously appointed by the British government upon request, but after the 1926 Imperial Conference decided that the British government and the dominion governments were equal in status, the selection of the Governor-General was changed to be decided by the dominion government itself and appointed upon request. Therefore, Isaacs's appointment as Governor-General of Australia is the first practical result of the resolutions of the last Imperial Conference. Isaacs is over seventy years old and is the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia.</p>
<h3>The Scottish Coal Mine Strike is Serious</h3>
<p>Opposing the Calculation of Working Hours on a Weekly Basis</p>
<p>The Whole Country May Rise Up in Support</p>
<p>Reuters, London, February 3rd - The coal mine strike has now developed seriously. Last night, Mr. Cook, Secretary of the Miners' Federation, stated that Scotland's position would force other coal regions to deal with the whole problem, and that Scotland could not be left to face it alone. This statement is almost interpreted as a nationwide coal mine strike in support of the Scottish miners. It is reported that British Prime Minister MacDonald is scheduled to meet with the directors of the Miners' Federation today.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, February 2nd - The Scottish Miners' Conference held in Glasgow today decided to continue the strike, with the exception of the Ayrshire region, where most coal mines are operating as usual. Although the Northumberland Miners' Union executive committee opposes the calculation of working hours on a weekly basis, it decided not to support a nationwide strike at this time.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Actively Invade Our Country's Territory</h3>
<p>To Determine the So-Called New Manchuria-Mongolia Policy</p>
<p>Electric Communications Agency, Tokyo, February 3rd - As a result of Zhang Xueliang's visit to Nanjing, the Chinese side's attitude towards the Manchuria Railway has suddenly become active. The authorities, whose relationship with the Manchuria-Mongolia policy had become deadlocked, are gradually becoming enthusiastic about studying countermeasures. Therefore, Senkoku, President of the South Manchuria Railway, met with Kimura, Director of the South Manchuria Railway, who had recently returned from inspecting Manchuria and Mongolia, to hear his detailed report. The report was followed by consultation with Foreign Minister Shidehara. President Senkoku also decided to exchange views with the four authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Army, the Colonial Affairs Bureau, and the South Manchuria Railway on the basis of Director Kimura's report, in order to establish a new Manchuria-Mongolia policy.</p>
<h3>Japan's Population Increases</h3>

<h3>Continued Trial of Russian Sedition Case</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, February 2nd - During the continued trial of the sedition case, the defendant Professor Yunovsky testified about his meeting with Milyukov, the Foreign Minister of the Kerensky government. Milyukov stated that France strongly supported the idea of intervention, and although labor would oppose it, the socialist leaders would secretly support it. At that time, because the domestic political situation in France was unstable, Poincaré could not implement his intervention plan. Milyukov was deeply frustrated and postponed the plan until 1930. However, this year, because Poland and Romania were not ready and because of the economic crisis in Western Europe, it had to be postponed again. According to the planned intervention, France would be responsible for finance and would be the leader. Poland, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, or Finland, and Yugoslavia would participate. However, whether Czechoslovakia would participate was undecided. The beginning of the uprising was intended to use the disturbance of Soviet Russia's commercial policy and border disputes as an excuse. The rights that each participating country should receive after the success of the event have been stipulated. Thereupon, the prosecutor read in court three articles written by Poincaré published in a Paris newspaper, all of which advocated that Europe should unite to resist the Soviet Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Riga, February 3rd - A Moscow dispatch states that the Russian authorities have discovered a major conspiracy by engineers to sabotage in the Nizhny Novgorod region. For several weeks, machinery in large factories there has been repeatedly damaged, disrupting the activities of Soviet Russian industry.</p>
<h3>The Question of the Next French President</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Briand Has the Highest Voice</p>
<p>France is Governed by a Joint Election by Two Houses</p>
<p>Paris Report - President Doumergue's seven-year term will expire in May of next year. It is not yet possible to predict who will succeed Doumergue as President of France. Doumergue has repeatedly stated that he has decided not to seek re-election. The people who have been widely discussed and are expected to be elected as president are: firstly, the current Foreign Minister Briand; secondly, Painleve, who ran for president with Doumergue seven years ago; and thirdly, former cabinet member Lebrun. Although these three have not been nominated as formal candidates, their supporters have already begun to campaign extensively to win their support. Among the three, Briand has the greatest momentum. However, Briand is a bachelor, and like Doumergue, the French White House has felt very lonely for seven years without a hostess. If this is added for another seven years, a large part of the color will inevitably be lost at various ceremonies. Also, Briand's personality does not seem suitable for sitting in the White House, because Briand is fond of farming and has several acres of good land in the Coogee area. He goes to the countryside for a short stay during his free time. If he is elected president, his whereabouts will be restricted everywhere, which may not be what he likes. However, this kind of personal relationship cannot be seriously considered in politics. From the perspective of France's political future, Briand's presidency is of great importance, because guiding France's foreign policy in the White House is more powerful and permanent than in Congress. The biggest reason for the opposition in Congress to oppose Briand's presidency is also this. It is expected that among the major issues to be considered in Congress in the next few months, the presidential event will occupy one of them. The election of the president of France is by a joint vote of the upper and lower houses, which is different from other countries where the president is elected by the people. The voting location is in the Palace of Versailles. (World)</p>

<h3>Important News Jiangxi Business Community Asks Chairman Chiang to Supervise the Suppression of Communists</h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Commerce and the Nanchang General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed General Commander Chiang yesterday, saying: "We, Jiangxi, have suffered from communist bandits since the time of Ye Ting and He Long, and their success is due to Zhu De and Mao Zedong. They have secretly grown and spread. Jiangxi is the deepest and most miserable victim. We hereby shed tears of blood and present to Your Excellency a painful statement. Since the great change of the Communist bandits in the 16th and 17th years of the Republic of China, in the winter of that year, they tried to use the poisonous flames in Wan'an, Taihe, and other counties, burning, killing, kidnapping, plundering property, and dividing land. Zhu De and Mao Zedong lurked in the Jinggang Mountains, and the areas of Lianhua, Yongxin, Ninggang, and other areas in western Jiangxi were all miserably poisoned. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, the large army encircled and suppressed the Jinggang Mountains and destroyed their nests, but unfortunately did not annihilate their leaders. Zhu's poison fled from the old nest, running like pigs and wolves, and turning the places they passed into ruins. Their red flames spread from Suichuan to various counties in southern Jiangxi and set up nests in Mopanshan, Donggu, and other places, and used Xingguo and Yudu as the main bases of the red bandits. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, they became even more elusive, running from southern Jiangxi to western Fujian, southern Fujian, and the eastern border of Guangdong, spreading their fierce attacks as if entering a no-man's land. Later, in the spring of this year, they took advantage of the fact that the campaign against the rebels was in full swing and there was no time to look south. The spread of the red flames in the province was a thousand miles a day. Leaders such as Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Huang Gonglue poisoned the entire province. The division of shares, such as Chen, Lin, Fang, and Shao, poisoned one side. The provincial capital of Nanchang dared to encircle and attack the important town of Jingji twice, and were both captured for more than a month. Eastern Jiangxi was almost covered in red flames, and southern Jiangxi was isolated in one city. Western Jiangxi has long been a den of bandits, and half of northern Jiangxi is in danger. Even Zhangshu, the center of the Gan River, has been miserably ravaged. Some places have been occupied by bandits for many years, and some for a few months. It is difficult to find a clean land for thousands of miles. The areas passed by the red flames are dark, the wind and clouds change color, the houses are in ashes, and the lives of the people are like insects and sand. Everywhere you look, there are broken walls and remnants of corpses. It is heartbreaking to hear the cries of ghosts and gods and the groans of blades. Burning contracts, dividing fields, confiscating property, conscripting men, forcing women, and dividing wives are all that is left to do. The dead are piled up like white bones, and the green phosphorescence is rampant in the wilderness. The living are dying and waiting to die. For example, in Ji'an city alone, the number of people killed in a month has reached more than 10,000, and there are thousands of kidnappings. In Xingguo county alone, more than 20,000 people have been killed in the past month, and thousands have died from being forced to be vanguards and forced to commit suicide. As for the sharing of women, the burning of houses, and the confiscation of property, it is difficult to count them all. From this example, it can be seen that Jiangxi has suffered such a fate. This is truly the brutality of Huang Chao and Zhang Xianzhong's invasion, and there is no such fierce slaughter as in Jiading and Yangzhou, and there is no such long-lasting disaster as in the Guangdong Haifeng and Lufeng, and the red flames in Hubei and Hunan are not so widespread. In this great disaster, the lives of the people are on the verge of extinction. It is a great joy to hear that our Commander-in-Chief's campaign against the rebels has been victorious and that Hebei has been pacified, and it is also fortunate that Lin Shuai's great army has gathered and rushed to Jiangxi to suppress the communists. Our Jiangxi people are coming to Suwang, and there is hope of salvation. How can we make such groans and cause so much trouble? Only by learning from the past and being cautious, are we even more worried. There are many armies suppressing the bandits, but the power of the red bandits is very great. Remembering that when Zhu De and Mao Zedong were driven out of their old nest, there were only a few hundred remnants of guns and a thousand bandits. Now, including Zhu De, Lao Peng, Huang Gonglue, and the small gangs of communists who have fled to Jiangxi, there are about 70,000 to 80,000 rifles, 4,000 to 5,000 Mauser pistols, more than a thousand machine guns, hundreds of cannons, and countless spears of the communist bandits. In the beginning, the government never failed to send troops to track and suppress them. Every time they suppressed them, they always reported victory, and they always reported seizing several guns and killing many bandits, and they always reported recovering a certain place. They also always said that the communist bandits were like fish in a cauldron, vulnerable to attack, and would soon be extinguished. What was the result? There is no need to repeat it. It is not enough to redify the entire Jiangxi, and the poisonous effects have spread to Hunan and Hubei, and even to Sichuan, Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian. The momentum of the prairie fire cannot be approached. The future of the party and the country is in deep danger. If the Commander-in-Chief does not personally supervise the encirclement and suppression with the remaining prestige of his divine martial arts, it will be difficult to achieve results. Moreover, if the leader is not captured, the seeds of disaster will be left behind. Once he calls for the ashes to be rekindled, this is even more a matter of concern. Furthermore, what is even more important is that the disaster in Jiangxi is widespread and long-lasting. Farmers and workers have lost their jobs, and all industries are declining. Who will save those who are displaced and homeless? The dead are full of grievances and cannot be诉, and the living have no plan. It is not possible to ask for urgent relief if the country exists, and they will all turn into ditches. Our Commander-in-Chief must be able to coordinate the overall situation and feel sorry for the survivors. On the one hand, he must concentrate the army and personally supervise the encirclement and suppression to eliminate the root of the disaster. On the other hand, he must exempt the people from taxes and all local requisitions and send huge sums of money to save our disaster victims, so that the great disaster can be turned around and the survivors can rely on it. We shed tears of blood and state our words with trepidation, awaiting orders."</p>
<h3>Excavation of the Ancient Tan Kingdom City in Shandong</h3>
<p>Discovering Black Pottery from 3,000 Years Ago</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Archaeological Team of the Academia Sinica, in conjunction with the Shandong Provincial Government, formed the Shandong Antiquities Research Association, planning to excavate the old Tan Kingdom in Licheng and the old Qi capital in Linzi. Starting on November 7th, they began excavating the old Tan Kingdom city. Over the past twenty-odd days, significant discoveries have been made. The number of unearthed artifacts has reached over 1,190, totaling over 10,000 pieces. In addition to the antiquities of the old Tan Kingdom (dating back over 2,600 years), they have also discovered black pottery from before the Tan Kingdom. It is determined to be at least from the late Shang Dynasty, dating back over 3,000 years, which is an unexpected and significant contribution to archaeology. I personally went to inspect on the 29th of last month and inquired about the excavation process as follows:</p>
<p>From Jinan to Longshan: I took the Jiaoji Railway train at 8:30 am on the 29th from Jinan Station and arrived at Longshan Station at 9:30 am. I happened to meet a worker hired by the Research Association to dig the city, who led me to Longshan Town, located about two li northeast of the station. Upon arriving at the Research Association's office, I met Mr. Guo Baojun, a surveyor from the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica, and Mr. Dong Zuobin, an editor. After explaining the purpose of my visit, Mr. Dong and Mr. Guo warmly welcomed me. Mr. Dong had a long conversation with me, detailing the reasons for coming to Shandong to excavate the ancient Tan Kingdom city, the process, the current situation, and the various types of items obtained. The initiation of the excavation: According to Mr. Dong, Wu Jinding (Yu Ming), a Shandong native and archaeologist, is a member of the Academia Sinica and currently a professor at Qilu University. Several years ago, he knew that there were fragments of tiles and bricks from the ancient Tan Kingdom city of the Spring and Autumn period in Longshan Town near Jinan, and reported it in detail to the Academia Sinica. This summer, when the Jin army occupied Jinan, they dug trenches in the area and unearthed many antiquities. The Academia Sinica, recognizing the importance of the discovery, decided to come to Shandong for excavation, first excavating the ancient Tan Kingdom city in Jinan and then excavating the old Qi capital in Linzi next year. Therefore, Chuan Sinian, Li Ji, Dong Zuobin, and Guo Baojun were sent to Shandong to contact the Education Department. After the Education Department submitted the matter to the Provincial Government Standing Committee, it was decided to appoint Wang Xiantang (Director of the Library), Yang Zhensheng (President of Qingdao University), Zhang Dunne (Senior Middle School Principal), and Liu Cixiao (Secretary of the Education Department) as members to join the members of the Academia Sinica to form the Shandong Antiquities Research Association. After the association was established, Chuan Sinian was elected as the chairman, Li Ji as the director of work, and Wang Xiantang as the secretary. An office was set up in Jinan Longshan Town, and excavation began on the 7th in a wheat field, paying the landowner 30 yuan per mu. For those without wheat seedlings, 10 yuan per mu was paid. Currently, 36 workers are hired, divided into five groups, each receiving a daily wage of 4 jiao. Currently, 2,000 yuan has been spent, all paid by the Academia Sinica. The office is mainly managed by Li Ji, Dong Zuobin, Guo Baojun, and Wu Jinding. Attached are eight articles of the regulations of the Antiquities Research Association as follows (Regulations of the Shandong Antiquities Research Association jointly established by the National Academia Sinica and the Shandong Provincial Government (1) Upon the proposal of the National Academia Sinica, the National Academia Sinica and the Shandong Provincial Government shall each appoint two to five members to form the Shandong Antiquities Research Association. (2) The members appointed by the National Academia Sinica shall be recommended by the Institute of History and Philology of the National Academia Sinica. The members appointed by the Shandong Provincial Government shall be recommended by the Education Department of the Shandong Provincial Government. (3) The association shall have one chairman, one director of work, and one secretary, who shall be elected by the members. (4) The work of the association shall be temporarily divided into three steps: investigation, excavation, and research. The National Academia Sinica shall be responsible for the scientific guidance, and the Shandong Provincial Government shall be responsible for the protection. (5) The address of the association shall be set in Jinan, and an office shall be established at the excavation site. (6) The working expenses of the association shall be borne by the National Academia Sinica and the Shandong Provincial Government separately. When necessary, the National Academia Sinica shall bear them exclusively. (7) The antiquities unearthed shall be stored in the association for research. However, for the convenience of research, the association may submit a portion to be studied elsewhere after passing it, but it must be returned to the association within a certain period. (8) The current excavation work is temporarily conducted in Longshan and Linzi as pilot areas.</p>
<p>Achievements of the excavation: Excavation began on November 7th. After entering the ground by one meter, the city wall of the Tan Kingdom was discovered. The wall was 15 meters wide, and the rammed earth traces were clearly visible. There were also tombs built with Han bricks on the city wall, which proves that there were still residents in Tan City during the Han Dynasty. Except for the modern items in the uppermost layer of the ground, no items from after the Han Dynasty have been found below the Tan City wall, which further proves that there have been no residents in the city since the Han Dynasty. Among the cultural items of the Tan Kingdom, the dou (stemmed bowl), li (tripod cauldron), and gui (food vessel) are the most numerous among the pottery, with some being 80% intact. When digging below the Tan City, gray soil was found. In the gray soil, there were black pottery tiles and fragments. The black pottery fragments are the best material for studying Eastern culture, as no items from after the Tan Kingdom have been found in the strata where the black pottery fragments were discovered. This proves that the black pottery is definitely from before the Tan Kingdom. Although there is no time to study it now and its age cannot be determined, it is known that our country first used stone tools, and the Shang Dynasty began to use bronze tools. However, no bronze tools were found in the strata where the black pottery fragments were discovered, which proves that the black pottery fragments are at least contemporary with bronze tools, or even earlier than the Shang Dynasty. We hoped to discover the culture of the Tan Kingdom, but we unexpectedly discovered the culture before the Tan Kingdom, which was beyond our initial expectations. Mr. Dong also showed me the black pottery fragments he had obtained. They were black in color, and the thinner ones were more translucent than Kangxi porcelain. Some also had extremely fine spiral patterns, which were not only antique but also valuable. The precision of ancient Chinese industry was not inferior to modern Europe and America. The items obtained from Tan City and below Tan City have been washed, numbered, and stored. The numbers have now reached 1,193, totaling more than 10,000 pieces, divided into 58 boxes. Among the pottery are dou (stemmed bowl), li (tripod cauldron), and ding (cauldron).</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>·　Dou and li are the most numerous. Among the bronze ware are arrowheads, spring coins, and half-mouth Qi knives. Among the stone tools are stone knives, stone axes, and stone ben (archaic weapon). There are also two pieces of jade. According to research, the latest are from the Han Dynasty. Among the bone tools are bone combs, bone awls, bone needles, and bone arrowheads. The scapula divination tool is even more important than the turtle shell divination tool of the Yin Ruins.</p>
<p>Archaeology of Tan City: Mr. Dong then accompanied me to the excavation site. Leaving the east gate of Longshan Town, there is a river, which is the Wuyuan River recorded in the Commentary on the Water Classic. The towering plateau protruding from the ground on the east bank of the river is Tan City. However, the Water Classic records that the river is east of the city, but now it is west of the city, perhaps due to the passage of time and the changes in mountains and rivers. Stepping onto the plateau, the rammed earth traces of Tan City can be seen. Each layer is about half a foot thick. The locals call this place Goose and Duck City or Chengzihai. There is a small village called Shanchengzi at the southern end of the city. However, according to Mr. Dong, Goose and Duck City was actually in Huantai County during the Six Dynasties. Shanchengzi and Chengzihai are variations of the Tanzi City sound, which is also unknown. The city is 450 meters long and wide, completely a plateau. Looking at Pingling City from afar, it is about two li northeast. The city wall is still higher than the ground, probably because the city has been replaced less. At this time, Li Ji, the director of the Research Association, was measuring, and Mr. Dong led me to the excavation site to inspect.</p>
<p>The situation of the excavation: On this day, Longshan Town held a grand theatrical performance and stopped working without excavation. The excavation site is in the center of the city, dug into north-south longitudinal trenches, each trench 10 meters long and 1 meter wide. The deepest part was dug to 6 meters. Looking down from the trench, the rammed earth traces of the Tan City wall and the gray soil layer where black pottery fragments were unearthed are clearly two sections. The gray soil layer is 6 meters deep, but it is still higher than the plain outside the plateau. The original plan was to dig 45 sections of longitudinal trenches 10 meters long. Now 39 sections have been dug. It is planned to dig another horizontal trench, but due to the cold weather, it was decided to abandon it. Black pottery fragments can be picked up everywhere outside the trench. I also picked up several pieces.</p>
<p>Impressions upon returning: After the inspection, Mr. Dong and I returned to Longshan Town. Mr. Dong said that the association decided to go to Linzi next spring to excavate the Qi capital city and the tombs of the Qi kings, which should yield more complete items. The shortcoming this time is that no characters have been found, but there seem to be symbols and a few characters on various pottery pieces. I also heard people talking in groups of three or five, saying that the Research Association was digging up broken tiles and bricks, what was the use? Some also said that they had dug up a lot of gold and silver, which shows that the villagers are ignorant and only know that gold and silver are treasures. I took the train back to Jinan at 2:00 pm (December 1st).</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie Convenes Naval Defense Conference</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Northeast Navy Commander Shen Honglie has returned to Qingdao this time to strengthen the reorganization of naval fleets, marine corps, and air squadrons. In addition to inspecting the fleets and holding autumn naval exercises in Laoshan Bay last week, he convened the second naval defense conference at the naval headquarters on the 29th. The attendees included Huang Xuxu, director of the Qingdao Office, Gao Fenghua, director of the Yu Ordnance Factory, Zhang Hehuo, commander of the Marine Corps, Captain Huang of the Air Squadron, Ling Xiao, commander of the First Fleet, and the captains of various ships in Qingdao. The internal reorganization and naval defense matters were discussed in detail, which can be roughly divided into four items: (1) Issue orders to various ships to clear out the accumulated bandits on the coastal islands as soon as possible. (2) Take measures to protect coastal fishermen, and severely punish those who disturb fishermen or hinder the livelihoods of island residents. (3) Order the Marine Corps to assist the police in handling public security on land. (4) Reorganize military discipline in various departments, and responsible officers should earnestly admonish their subordinates to uphold military reputation. (December 1st)</p>
<h3>Lu Xingbang's Department to be Transferred to Western Fujian Soon</h3>
<p>Yan You will be taken over by Liu's Division</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Regarding the transfer of Lu Xingbang's department to western Fujian, Chairman Jiang recently sent a telegram to the provincial government, which was forwarded to Lu for compliance, and Chairman Yang repeatedly urged it. Zhou Zhiqun has telegraphed the provincial government, requesting that a team be sent to take over Sha Yong and inquiring about the allocation of military expenses. The telegram stated that the department is preparing to depart for western Fujian in its entirety. However, it is not yet clear whether the supplies will be allocated directly by the province or whether funds will be raised in Beijing. We hope to receive instructions and allocated funds to maintain operations. Although the province has not yet made a decision, Lu seems to have no choice but to lead the First Brigade to set out immediately for western Fujian.</p>
<p>Lu Xingbang was previously concerned that the provincial military preparedness had not been removed, and there would be concerns about the rear once he departed. Although the provincial government quickly ordered all armies to allow passage and telegraphed Lu's army to set out with peace of mind to meet expectations, Lu would have an excuse if the departure fee was not allocated. Chairman Yang has ordered He Gonggan and Chen Peikun to raise funds and remit them to Yan for application.</p>
<p>The defense of Yan You will be filled by a certain department, which is also related to the issue of Lu's department's departure. Recently, there were reports that Liu's division and the Second Brigade would take over the defense. Now, Liu's division has been tasked with filling the defense. On the 28th, Liu Heding specially went to the provincial government to visit Chen Peikun and Yang Tingying, the director of military affairs, to discuss the handover. It is said that concrete measures have been decided. As for the defense of Datian, the provincial government ordered the Minbei Bandit Suppression Advance Team commanded by Chen Guohua to fill the defense, which was announced yesterday.

<h3>Wuhu-Hefei Shuttle Boat Robbed</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Wuhu is the commercial center of Anhui Province, and its transportation is also very important. In addition to Chinese and foreign merchant ships on the Yangtze River, as well as long-distance buses to Jingwu, Guangxuan, etc., small boats operating in various places include Nanjing, Dong'anqing, Datong, Hefei, Chaoxian, Nanling, Xuancheng, etc., which are also very developed in carrying goods and passengers. Unexpectedly, in recent years, southern Anhui, which was once known for its peace, has become a den of bandits, so that all but one small boat to Nanjing have been robbed, and some boats have been robbed several times. Although shipowners have repeatedly appealed to the authorities to take measures to protect them, it is difficult to defend against the numerous bandits in the interior. The other day (29th), the Yuan Bing shuttle boat from Wuhu to Hefei, carrying a tugboat full of passengers and cargo, set off for Hefei. At 7:30 pm, it was sailing on the Qingxikou River, ten miles away from Chaoxian County, when bandits who had been lying in wait on the boat, disguised as passengers, suddenly opened fire, forcing the boat to stop. At the same time, bandits lurking nearby also rowed several boats carrying more than 20 bandits and boarded the shuttle boat, firing shots to intimidate the passengers. As the wind and rain were raging and the sky was dark, the bandits wantonly searched and robbed, first robbing the tugboat and then robbing the passengers on the shuttle boat, even those who had only one or two yuan of silver hidden on them were swept away. The robbery lasted for half an hour before they transported the stolen goods down and rowed away. The total loss is estimated to be 20,000 yuan, and one fireman was beaten and seriously injured. Fortunately, the passengers were unharmed. The boat resumed sailing to Chaoxian County at 9:00 pm. The Chaohu Water Police Bureau reported the incident and immediately dispatched patrol boats to pursue the bandits, but they were nowhere to be found. A few days ago, the Xin Shenglong shuttle boat from Wuhu to Datong was robbed in the Bianxingzhou area, and the second mate was injured. The Sixth District Bandit Suppression Command successively arrested Hu Shengwu, Liu Haiqing, Zheng Haishan, Yu Changqing and other four bandits in Wuhu Ju Zhi'an and other places. They confessed to the robbery of the boat. This morning at 11:00, they were tied up and taken to the 13th Daomen along with Wang Huanzhang, Zhang Yejing, Zhang Rongguang and other seven bandits arrested in the countryside for robbery, and executed by shooting.

<h3>Soviet Union Accuses White Russians of Hindering Education Again</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Russian Consulate in Harbin requested the authorities to ban White Russian political activities in the Northeast a month ago. The authorities ordered the Special Police Department to search the homes of important White Russian leaders several times, but to no avail. The Russian Consulate has not protested again since then. As for the schools for Soviet railway staff children in the Special Zone, they are run entirely by red personnel, and the White Russians have no say in the matter. Unexpectedly, the Soviet side recently suddenly stated that Soviet students are being subjected to reactionary oppression by White Russian youths, which makes school education quite unfree. The Chinese education authorities ignore this and do not ban it. The Moscow government secretly ordered Soviet school teachers along the East Railway line to prepare reports so that its plenipotentiary representative can lodge a protest with our country at the Sino-Russian conference. Currently, various Soviet schools are fabricating facts to make reports.</p>
<p>It is also heard that Moscow will change the highest Far East party organ into the Special Zone Party Department. The party department has the power to handle all party affairs in the Far East, and the cadres are the commanding organ. Also, the headquarters of the Soviet Third International Communist Party currently feels that Shanghai and Liaoning lack talents who are familiar with foreign languages ​​for implementing various plans, and specially ordered the Soviet agencies in Harbin to send party members from the Special Zone Party Department and the Youth Party Department who are proficient in foreign languages ​​to Shanghai and Liaoning for deployment at any time.

<h3>Local Correspondence Songjiang</h3>
<p>Notorious bandit arrested and executed in Fengjing: Gao Zhongshu, a bandit from Fengjing, had repeatedly committed major kidnapping cases. The authorities had ordered his arrest for a long time but had not succeeded. Last month, Chen Zhankui, the director of the Songshan Fengjing Joint Defense Office, together with the military and police, formed a joint team. Detective Yang Shijie was arrested in Shenjiabang and seized guns and ammunition. He was escorted to the Garrison Command. After interrogation by Battalion Commander Zhang Rubit, the case was reported to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and approved for execution. After receiving the document, Battalion Commander Zhang sent Detective Yang, a platoon leader, and others to escort the criminal to Fengjing on the 2nd and executed him by shooting at Wenchang Pavilion.</p>
<p>Bandit leader Yao Jinshan arrested in Shanghai: On the 29th of last month, Yao Jinshan, the leader of the kidnapping of the Shen family's young child in Fengjing and other cases, was wandering in front of the Small World. Detective Yang Shijie of the Military and Police Inspection Office and informant Cai Ahai recognized him. They joined the police on duty at the Second Precinct of the First District and arrested him, taking him back to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for custody. Detective Yang has reported to Songjiang that the county government has prepared a document and sent Detective Yang to Shanghai to escort him back for trial according to law.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Young man kidnapped but luckily escapes: Xie Zhenghua, a sixteen-year-old apprentice at Shixin Changhua Cosmetics Store in Guanqian Street, a native of Ganlu, Suzhou, went out of the store to his father Zhou Yongquan's residence at No. 10 Chuanzhu Lane in Changmen Nei the day before yesterday afternoon to pick up winter clothes. Because his family had not yet sent the clothes, Xie turned to the Qian Wanli Ganlu shuttle port outside Pingmen to send a letter urging them. When he arrived, the boat had already left, so he had to enter Pingchuan back to the store. However, when he walked to a remote place behind Beisita Pagoda, two strangers suddenly came forward and stopped Xie, threatening him with a pistol. Xie saw that they were fierce and did not dare to argue with them. He was then taken by the two men out of Pingmen and onto a boat. The bandits took a cup of tea and forced Xie to drink it. Xie fell into a coma after drinking it. The bandits immediately sailed the boat to the vicinity of Guanli outside the Qimu Gate. It was already late at night, so they docked the boat. A bandit asked Xie if his family had money. Xie replied that he was an apprentice, how could he have money? One bandit said not to say much and take him to Shanghai. After a while, a bandit woman took dinner to Xie. Xie couldn't swallow it because he was frightened. When Xie was sleeping, the bandits planned to tie him up, but Xie begged for mercy and was spared. Until midnight, Xie pretended to go to the toilet and got up twice, but was watched by the bandits. On the third time, the bandits were all asleep. Xie then stepped ashore, escaped along the railway, and arrived at Suzhou Station at about 4:00 am yesterday morning. At that time, he was mentally exhausted, so he hired a rickshaw to enter the city and went to his father's place to describe the incident in detail. His family was shocked when they heard about it. It was a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Escort arrested and jailed for letting prisoner escape: Four judicial policemen from the Yang County Government were ordered to escort two prisoners to Ganzhou Inspection County. When they arrived in Zhongzhou, one prisoner escaped. The four policemen returned to the county to report to the county government. The county magistrate believed that the escape of the prisoner was due to bribery by the judicial police, so he arrested all four policemen. One of the policemen, Ye Changhou, was visited in prison by his younger brother Ye Za, who colluded with his friend Xie Weishu, who secretly carried a hemp rope. During the meeting, he sleeved the rope to the policeman and agreed to nail an iron hook on the toilet outside the prison that night so that the policeman could hang the rope down. That night, he escaped from prison without a trace. It was not until the morning that they discovered the escape. Yesterday, the county magistrate telegraphed the President of the High Court, Lin. After receiving the telegram, President Lin immediately telegraphed the trial officer of Suqian County, Wang Enpei, to investigate and deal with the matter according to law.</p>
<p>Lu Xu Town villagers kidnapped: The other night, four or five bandit ships from the Luhu Township of Wujiang County, led by Little Boss Xi Zhu Luo A Mei under Ah Shu, the Taibao of Pudong, resulted in the kidnapping of two villagers. Yesterday, the district reported the incident to the Water Public Security Third District and requested an investigation. District Chief Shen ordered the 14th team led by Team Leader Xu to go to rescue the hostages. The court requested that opium be used for medicine: Yesterday (2nd), Lin, the President of the High Court, received a petition from Huang Yongzhong, the President of the Zhenjiang District Court, requesting that the opium confiscated by the court be prepared as anti-smoking pills using chemical methods and distributed to the opium prisoners in custody. The reason is that recently there have been reports that many opium prisoners in the Suzhou Third Prison have died of opium addiction. There are also many opium prisoners in prisons in Zhenjiang, Shanghai, and other places. In order to prevent the same opium addiction from causing death, this request is made. Dong Changmin, the warden of the Shanghai Second Prison, also sent a public letter to the Zhenjiang District Court proposing this proposal. After receiving the petition, President Lin said that it should be considered and then submitted to the Ministry of Justice for approval.</p>
<p>County magistrate accused of bribery and torture: Chen Qun, a resident of Su County, telegraphed the High Court yesterday (2nd), stating that the resident was involved in a civil lawsuit in the county government. The county magistrate and the district chief colluded to solicit bribes from the resident, but were unsuccessful. They actually took the resident to the Chenghuang Temple in the middle of the night and used private torture to force a confession. Now he is only given one meal a day in prison. He requested relief. After receiving the petition, President Lin has sent someone to investigate thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Continuing to build roads by conscripting labor: The Construction Bureau has received an order from the Department to continue building roads by conscripting labor. The County Political Conference discussed the measures and decided to first build the Fengzhe Road, that is, to use the Qin Gong Seawall from Fengcheng to Zhelin, which is more than 30 li long. The industry will open on January 15th. The Construction Bureau technicians Chen Gongzhao and others have been sent to investigate. However, in order to balance the labor throughout the county, the districts that have already conscripted labor in the previous session will be excluded, and only the first, fourth, and fifth districts that have not yet conscripted labor will be ordered to build.</p>
<p>Department to investigate the situation of the converted fields: The case of converting fields for grain transportation in our county has been repeatedly requested by local agencies to postpone the implementation. The Department ordered an investigation and is awaiting approval. It is now known that the Department has sent committee member Zhang Desheng to Fengxian on the 28th of last month to investigate the actual situation of the converted fields and to consult with party and government agencies in detail. At the same time, representatives of the tenant farmers Liao Wang and others went to pay their respects and requested that public opinion be adopted and the matter be handled slowly. Although no key points were obtained on the spot, committee member Zhang expressed before leaving that the situation of planting cotton in the converted fields in our county is indeed different from the situation of planting rice in the converted fields in Songjiang and Jinshan counties, and should be handled separately. He has already returned to the province yesterday to report.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Shocking news of a human head flying into the classroom: At about 3:00 pm the other day, a human head suddenly flew in from outside the wall into the classroom of the second grade of the primary school at the Hu Family Public School in Yanqiao Town, Fifth District (Tianshang City). The head was slightly black in color and had no neck. The teachers and students were all stunned by the sight, fearing that something would happen. They immediately dismissed school early and buried the head in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Rice boat robbed at Ya Cheng Bridge: Zhang Rongtai, a rice merchant from Changzhou, recently hired a boat and traveled to Wuxi to purchase rice in Yiyang. The other day, he arrived at Ya Cheng Bridge in our county in the evening and anchored the boat overnight. Unexpectedly, at about 2:00 am, a bandit boat suddenly came and six or seven bandits jumped out. They robbed the boat, tied up the boat owner Zhang Rongtai and the three crew members, and threatened them with pistols to keep silent. The boat owner resisted slightly and was severely beaten by a bandit with an iron ruler, injuring his leg. The bandits then wantonly searched and robbed for an hour before carrying the loot and jumping onto the bandit boat, speeding north. The rice boat was robbed of more than 300 yuan. Bandits rob in broad daylight and are arrested on the spot: Li Wang, a resident of Xinxiang, outside the North Gate of our county, went to Gaochangan the other day afternoon at about 1:00 pm for something. Unexpectedly, when she walked near the Zhangjia Stone Bridge, a bandit suddenly came from behind and stopped Li Wu and prevented her from going. He threatened her to keep silent and then searched her body. She was robbed of five yuan in banknotes, two yuan in current money, four jiao in silver coins, and dragged Li Wang to an abandoned tomb and beat her. Li Wang immediately shouted for help. At that time, the villagers nearby heard the sound and gathered to rescue her and captured a bandit and sent him to the Public Security Fifth Precinct. After the director of the precinct opened a trial, the bandit confessed that his name was Jiang Changgen, a native of Qingyang, Jiangyin, 32 years old. He directly admitted to robbing Li Wu of silver. Director Zhou prepared a document yesterday and sent him to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Total strike in cotton mills throughout the county: The silk mills in Wuxi are suffering from a slump in the silk market and poor business. They originally planned to implement a shutdown, but in order to maintain the livelihood of the workers, they reluctantly started their cars. Later, labor-capital disputes suddenly occurred. The county government convened an arbitration meeting and decided to pay wages at a 10% discount. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 pm the other day, a small number of troublemakers, starting from Zhou Shanbang, went to various silk mills to incite and force the female workers to strike. So, the 45 silk mills in Zhou Shanbang, Gongyun Bridge, and Ruichang, Qianfeng, Qian Shen, Qian Tai, San Tai, Yong Sheng, and other places outside the southeast gate successively stopped the cars. By about 5:00 pm, the silk mills throughout the county had fallen into a total strike. County Magistrate Shen has seriously investigated and dealt with the agitators. Yesterday morning, female workers from various silk mills gathered near the railway station. The Public Security Bureau and the Police Brigade sent police to suppress and maintain order. Suspect Wang Xiaomei and others were arrested and sent to the county for interrogation and bail. A propaganda team organized by five groups, including the party, government, police, labor, and silk mill trade unions, is now propagandizing and persuading people everywhere to resume work today.

<p>The Bandit Gang Passing Through Woyang Has Been Defeated</p>
<p>Woyang in northern Anhui and Yongcheng in eastern Henan border each other and have always been areas where bandits emerge. At the end of last month, a large gang of bandits, mixed with the defeated soldiers of Sun Dianying's troops and about seven or eight hundred communists from Suxian County, infiltrated the territory from the junction of northwestern Woyang and Yongcheng, burning, killing, raping, and looting in the Mazhuka collection area, which was extremely fierce. Upon receiving the report, the three-county militia headquarters of Woyang, Mengcheng, and Hao County dispatched the Woyang militia to intercept them. They clashed with the bandits in the Hechang Town area for a day and night of fierce fighting. The bandits were unable to withstand the pressure and fled in disarray to the north. More than a hundred male and female hostages were rescued on the spot. Dozens of bandits were killed or wounded, and the militia soldiers were also killed or wounded around seven or eight.

<h3>The Guanghua Team Won the Jiangnan University Football Match Against Fudan</h3>
<p>A Score of Two to One</p>
<p>| University Students Using Force in Football | Alas!</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan University Sports Association's football championship between Fudan and Guanghua was replayed at Jiangwan. As a result of the fierce battle, Guanghua won with a score of two to one. The two sides actually staged a violence play. Most of the spectators were students from the two schools. Although Guanghua's journey was long, nine cars of people went to watch, and the motive for the fight originated from these nine cars of people. Although the level of university football has been improved in recent years, the bad habits of university students have not been changed. Every competition often involves violence, which is so crude and deplorable.</p>
<p>During the first half, Guanghua's Xi Qiaosheng scored a goal after receiving a pass from Yang Renwei. During the competition, a Fudan player fell on Guanghua's spectators by the sideline, and the Guanghua students punched him. Guanghua player Xi Qiaosheng also stepped forward to help beat the Fudan students. The cheering squad of Fudan students stepped forward to mediate, and the situation calmed down after three or two minutes, but from then on, fighting occurred during the game.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Fudan's momentum was extremely strong, and the ball was often in front of Guanghua's goal. Fudan had two opportunities to take a twelve-yard penalty, but unfortunately both were missed. Instead, Guanghua's Xi Qiaosheng scored another goal. Fudan tried to retaliate, and right winger Li Lin crossed the ball, and Yu Shunzhang headed it in, resulting in a score of two to one, with Guanghua winning. In the middle of the second half, referee He Chunhui saw that the players on both sides were in conflict, and Guanghua's Zhang Changjiang and Fudan's Yu Guzhang were wrestling and fighting. The referee immediately disqualified the two. Guanghua's Xi Qiaosheng was the main instigator of the violence, so he was closely guarded by many Fudan players in the second half and had very few opportunities to move around.</p>

<p>Mailing Victory Over Jiangwan (A): The battle began. Mailing initially suffered setbacks and could not advance. However, due to its solid defense, Jiangwan also found it difficult to break through. Cheng Mingjue tried his luck with long-range shots, and both attempts went in, allowing Jiangwan to take a 4-0 lead. Mailing changed its strategy and used its strong and tall physique to engage in fierce close combat. Jiangwan was plunged into despair. In ten minutes, Mailing turned the tide and took an 11-5 lead. Fortunately, with the efforts of Zhang Jinxiang and Mo Mingquan, etc., they only trailed by 5 points. The score was Mailing 17, Jiangwan 12. Both sides launched another attack. Mailing made a strong move first, substituting players inside and outside. Jiangwan's formation was chaotic and suffered heavy losses, falling to a score of 12-21. They quickly reorganized their formation and fought fiercely again. Their performance gradually improved, and soon there was not much difference between them and Mailing. In the second half, both sides scored 16 points, which was not easy. As a result, Mailing won 33 to 28 against Jiangwan.</p>

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Held General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Resolution to Reject Water Rate Increase Proposal</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association held a general meeting at 4 PM yesterday to discuss the water rate increase proposed by the water company. More than 30 people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Xu Ji, Yu Qiaqing, Hu Mengjia, Xu Xinliu, Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Zilian, Wu Yaiqin, Chu Fucheng, Sun Jingxi, Zhu Peiyuan, Yuan Jinchu, Cao Zhigong, Zhang Yichen, Shen Tianxin, Wen Lanting, Fang Jiaobo, Zhu Yinjiang, Lufei Bohong, Hu Qinxiang, Wu Yunzhai, Hu Xisheng, Lin Kanghou, Li Bohan, Pan Xulun, Yan Esheng, Wang Yansong (representing Yan Esheng), Jiang Yinan, Zhang Rulin, Chen Tianyin, Lu Fengzhu, Xie Zhongfu (representing Wu Yaiqin), Ye Fuxiao, and others. After Chairman Wang Xiaolai conducted the formalities, he first reported that the executive committee on the water rate increase issue had, in accordance with the resolution of the previous general meeting, appointed three committee members, Pan Xulun, Yu Xiji, and He Dekui, to audit the water company's accounts. The audit has now been completed, and the general meeting has been reconvened for discussion. Next, Representative He Dekui of the Audit Committee read the audit report (see the special column). Then, Secretary Tao Leqin reported the opinions of the Shanghai Real Estate Association (see yesterday's newspaper). Discussion then began, with Li Bohan, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Zilian, Lin Kanghou, Shen Tianxin, Yuan Jinchu, Pan Xulun, Lufei Bohong, Yan Esheng, and others expressing their opinions one after another. After detailed discussion among the attendees, a unanimous resolution was passed to reject the water company's proposed increase in surcharges and modification of the contract. The reasons for their opposition were: (1) excessive interest guarantees and dividend distribution; (2) incomplete installation of water meters; (3) excessive expenses; (4) distribution of bonus shares; (5) bonus shares should not be guaranteed interest. The matter of alcohol should be handled by the executive committee.</p>
<h3>Trade Associations Held Joint Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Trade Regulations</h3>
<p>More than 200 Trade Associations Attended</p>
<p>Multiple Important Cases Resolved</p>
<p>The city's various trade associations held their second meeting of industry representatives yesterday to discuss industry regulations. More than 200 representatives from over 100 trade associations, including the dried goods industry, attended, including Ye Huijun, Zheng Chengqing, Sun Choucheng, Mao Chunpu, Yuan Mingjun, and Lu Fengzhu. Chairman Zheng Chengqing, Ye Jiaxing, Sun Choucheng, and Mao Chunpu conducted the formalities. Chairman Zheng Chengqing then reported on the efforts to petition in Beijing. The report is as follows:</p>
<p>Report: Everyone, it has been more than a month since the previous meeting entrusted us with handling the issue of trade regulations. In truth, our achievements have been minimal. However, we have never forgotten the mission entrusted to us by the last meeting, but our strength is limited, so please forgive us. The importance of trade regulations, as past facts and experiences tell us, lies in the fact that under the old guild system, if an apprentice could not obtain a guild certificate after completing his apprenticeship, he could not be employed by the same industry. If a member of the same industry could not obtain a guild certificate, he could not operate. Therefore, industries with guild organizations made daily progress in their skills, and the unity of the guilds was very strong. Since the reorganization of guilds into trade associations, those with trade regulations have been able to maintain their original unity, while those without trade regulations have experienced undesirable situations such as encroachment, seizure of business, and disruption of public affairs. Those engaged in international trade have lost international credibility and reduced export business. Those who set up shops to engage in retail business have damaged the credibility of the entire industry and harmed society. Just look at the facts in recent years. For example, the intestine industry, which specializes in sales to European and American countries, originally had an excellent position in international trade. A portion of the livelihoods of the agricultural and commercial sectors depended on it. However, because those in this industry lacked a trade association organization, they raised prices to buy and sold at low prices, and secretly mixed inferior goods. As a result, business could not be sustained, and after being shipped abroad for inspection, they were deemed a health hazard and even banned from import. In recent years, the intestine industry's trade association has worked hard to gradually restore its former glory. Another example is the mahjong tile industry. A few years ago, sales abroad were extremely prosperous. However, due to mutual encroachment among those in this industry, and the lack of trade regulations to restrict them, they reduced labor and stole materials. As a result, the governments of various countries took measures to restrict imports. These are all major losses in international trade, and everyone knows it. Even more widespread are situations such as mutual disruption, destruction, damage to credibility, and harm to society. Therefore, when the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held its first meeting of member representatives to discuss this issue, all industries expressed sympathy. Subsequently, a request was submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which oversees commerce nationwide, also knows that trade regulations are essential for maintaining the commercial sector and improving the trade association. It must be able to give us a satisfactory response. Who knew that the responsible personnel of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce did not understand commercial conditions and were rejected? This was truly unexpected. Afterwards, they persisted in their prejudices and did not think about rescuing the situation, claiming that trade regulations had no legal basis in the laws. However, upon checking Article 2 of the Trade Association Law, the purpose of a trade association is to increase and maintain public interest and correct business abuses. Trade regulations are one way to achieve this purpose. This has a strong basis in this law. Furthermore, upon checking Article 1 of the Civil Law on Debt, in the absence of law, custom and trade regulations are the written customs of an industry. This also has a very definite legal status. We see the above facts and laws. This time, the united request of various industries to approve trade regulations is truly a work that is needed based on actual needs and within the scope permitted by law. From the last meeting of industry representatives to now, it has been more than a month. During this month, the work that has been done is that all industries and unions have jointly appealed. At the National Industry and Commerce Conference, thanks to the efforts of Mr. Wang Yansong and Bureau Director Wang Xiaoyan, Jiaobo, Ye Huijun and other gentlemen, it was finally passed at the National Industry and Commerce Conference and sent to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for adoption and implementation. To urge the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to implement it as soon as possible, the Committee for the Protection of Trade Regulations sent representatives to Beijing on the 18th of last month to petition the National Government and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, who have paid considerable attention to it. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce will also hold a departmental meeting to discuss this matter, which shows that it has attracted attention. Chambers of commerce in places such as Dongtai, Hangzhou, and Liaoning in Zhejiang have all unanimously expressed their support, which has aroused a nationwide trend. However, those who travel a hundred miles are halfway through at ninety. How to proceed from here depends on the unanimous efforts of various industries to decide on a strong plan so that various industries can follow this decision gradually to achieve good results. Therefore, we are convening the second meeting of industry representatives today to discuss the future plan of action, hoping that the representatives present will express their opinions and decide on the steps we should take. At the same time, for the sake of our own interests, we should request the National Government and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to dismiss and punish the responsible personnel who do not understand commercial conditions and make rash rejections of trade regulation issues. Next, Representative Ye Huijun of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce delivered a speech, stating that trade regulations are a major track for the development of commerce. If the industry can disregard the regulations, it is like losing the track, and the commercial sector will inevitably be chaotic. Therefore, the issue of trade regulations is truly a matter of life and death for our country. Brothers recently met with Chairman Chiang and Mayor Zhang and stated that there should be a satisfactory reply.</p>
<p>Discussion: (1) The Guangdong Dry Goods Industry proposed that trade associations in all industries should, in the spirit of mutual assistance, sanction non-member industries and industry members who disrupt trade regulations. The resolution was to retain it. (2) The Intestine Industry, Dried Goods Industry, and New Drug Industry jointly sent a telegram to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce urging them to implement it as soon as possible, stating that all industries that have not yet joined must abide by the trade regulations. The resolution was to pass it. (3) A telegram was sent to the National Government to order the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to implement the resolution as soon as possible. The resolution was to pass it. (4) Before the trade regulations formulated by the trade association have been ordered by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to be universally observed by all industries that have not yet joined, the acceptance of matters entrusted by government agencies will be temporarily suspended. The resolution was to pass it. In a temporary motion, it was proposed that the General Assembly send a telegram in its name to Mayor Zhang to forward it to Chairman Chiang, requesting that measures be taken to maintain order. The resolution was passed. The original telegram reads: Nanjing Central Hotel telegraphic message to Shanghai Mayor Zhang Yuejun Jian: Today, the various industries held a meeting of representatives. The group was excited about the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's rejection of the trade regulation case. Please forward it to Chairman Chiang to seek a solution to maintain commercial conditions. Shanghai Municipal Trade Association Representatives General Assembly bows.</p>
<h3>Issue of Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Stores Joining the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Should be limited to registration with Chinese officials in accordance with the law. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that Sino-foreign joint venture companies and stores should be limited to registration with Chinese officials in accordance with the law to join the Chamber of Commerce or trade associations as members. It has submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for supplementary explanation and sent a letter to the Silk Factory Trade Association for reference. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Submission to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Nanjing: Inquiries about whether Sino-foreign joint venture companies and stores in the city's copper, iron, and machine industries can join trade associations should be forwarded by the affiliated associations for review. The case has been submitted to the Central Government for approval and forwarded for instructions. However, upon checking the additional restrictions, there are considerable restrictions on the amount of capital, voting rights, and number of company directors, but the fact that the company or store must first register with Chinese officials is not listed as one of the conditions. It is naturally because Article 11 of the Implementing Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law already has regulations that there is no need to repeat them. However, upon checking Article 16 of the Implementing Rules of the Trade Association, all regulations that apply to the Implementing Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law are listed. However, Article 11 of the Implementing Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law is not included among those listed. If a Sino-foreign joint venture store requests to join a trade association, although its capital, voting rights, and number of directors meet the regulations of the Ministry, it has not registered with Chinese officials. The trade association has no laws and regulations to rely on to reject it in accordance with laws and regulations. If it wants to reluctantly accommodate it, it is afraid that various disputes will arise due to registration jurisdiction issues. How should it be handled? Should there be supplementary regulations to deal with it? I hereby submit this telegram to your department for review, hoping that you will give instructions for compliance. It will be convenient for everyone. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows.</p>
<p>Letter to Silk Factory Industry: Dear Sir/Madam, On the 2nd of this month, we received a letter stating that some Sino-foreign joint venture companies and stores are registered with the British government in Hong Kong or with the US government in the State of Delaware. Once legal relations arise, they are not subject to the sanctions of Chinese law. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce allowing these companies and stores to be members is tantamount to admitting foreign merchants as members. Please provide an explanation to dispel doubts. Upon investigation, Article 11 of the Implementing Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law states that store members should have a store within this area and have been registered in accordance with the law. Therefore, Sino-foreign joint venture companies and stores must first register with Chinese officials in accordance with the law and obtain the legal status of a Chinese business before they can join the association. The so-called companies and stores registered in the UK and the US cannot obtain membership status in accordance with the law. The worry that they will not be subject to Chinese law is naturally not a problem. I hereby send a letter to inform you. Sincerely, Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association</p>
<h3>British Economic Delegation Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Several Staff Members of the British Consulate Accompanied Them</p>
<p>The British Far East Economic Investigation Group and its entourage have been frequently entertained by British residents in Shanghai and the Japan Yarn Factory Trade Association in recent days. At 2:45 PM yesterday, they took a train to Beijing to meet with various ministers and inspect everything. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai in about 10 days to investigate the economic conditions of Shanghai, and then go north to Tianjin and Beijing. Yesterday, the Railway Bureau specially hung two decorated carriages. British Consul-General Bailinan, President of the British Chamber of Commerce, and Tang Shixuan, a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office, went to the station to send them off in a proper manner. It is heard that several staff members of the British Consulate accompanied the delegation to Beijing.</p>
<h3>People's Movements Record</h3>
<p>Anhui Chairman Chen Diaoyuan led Fan Xixu, Bai Baoshan, and forty attendants onto the 京沪 Railway's special sleeping car last night at eleven o'clock, heading for Beijing on the 27th night train. Many people from Shanghai's military and political circles went to the station to see them off.</p>

The association closed last month, and the two Liu and Tian are truly powerful to the excellence of our country in the competition. The two ended everything and took the Siberian Railway back to China, and changed cars to Beijing, returning to Shanghai from Jinpu Road today (4th) from the capital.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow is the Anniversary of the Zhaohhe Ship Uprising</h3>
<p>Held at the Municipal Party Department at 9 AM</p>
<p>December 5th is the anniversary of the assassination of Yuan Shikai's imperial system by the Kuomintang martyr Chen Ying Shi, who took over the Zhaohhe warship stationed in Shanghai in the fourth year of the Republic of China (i.e. the anniversary of the Zhaohhe warship uprising). The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department specially drafted a memorial plan and submitted it to the Municipal Executive Committee for review. The plan has now been approved by the Municipal Executive Committee and decided to hold a memorial meeting at 9 AM on the 5th on the third floor of the Municipal Party Department on LinYin Road, LaoXiMen. At that time, party departments, agencies, groups, and schools at all levels in this city should send four representatives to attend the meeting. The order of the meeting, staff slogans, etc. are recorded below.</p>
<p>Meeting Order: (1) All stand at attention (2) Sing the Party Song (3) Pay the highest respects to the Party National Flag and the General's portrait (4) The chairman respectfully reads the General's will (5) Silence (6) Chairman's report (7) Speech (8) Call the numbers (9) Adjournment</p>
<p>Meeting Staff: (Chairman) Pan Gongzhan (Recorder) Zhou Hanmei (Master of Ceremonies) Xu Yefu (Reception) Cao Huaqiu, Chen Ming, Zhang Hongwei, Chen Yunbi (Officer) Zhang Hanyun, Yuan Qingping.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Rectification Committee's Propaganda Department also regarded this month's 5th as the 15th anniversary of the Zhaohhe warship. Yesterday, it specially sent a letter to various agencies to attend the memorial meeting on that day and ordered the districts to hold it separately. It is currently under preparation.</p>
<h3>How to Commemorate the Zhaohe Uprising?</h3>
<p>The few cannons fired by the Zhaohe warship indirectly caused Yuan Shikai's death. The campaign to overthrow Yuan Shikai was a joint effort by many revolutionary forces within the country to fight against a traitorous and extremely cunning figure. They finally managed to defeat him. However, Yuan Shikai's ghost is still rampant throughout the country. Moreover, through his years of manipulating power, he caused the entire nation to lose its sense of integrity and shame, and the country's vitality was almost completely depleted. The remnants of the imperial system have not been completely eliminated to this day. The traitor Yan Xishan is a clear example. At the time when Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, Yan Xishan was the first to urge him to do so, greatly appreciated by Yuan Shikai, who even granted him the title of first-class marquis. This kind of shameless warlord should have long been despised by the people of the country. Yet, he still raises troops to initiate unrest and undermine unification. All of these are the toxic legacy of Yuan Shikai. Therefore, commemorating the Zhaohe Uprising should involve thoroughly eradicating all remnants of feudalism.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the target that the Zhaohe Uprising aimed to eliminate was Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai's self-proclaimed imperial system was subjectively due to his disregard for the people of the country and his excessive ambition. But objectively, it was due to the fact that many people at the time held illusions of being ruled and living in peace, and did not engage in building a stable and secure society. Moreover, members of the successful party abandoned their original aspirations, even disregarding the principles of the revolution, thinking that the Prime Minister's ideals were too lofty. This led the Prime Minister to sadly say, "I resigned from the presidency not because I feared the forces, but because I could not carry out the construction of the revolution." When we commemorate the Zhaohe Uprising, we should recognize that the chaos of warlord cycles in the decade or so after the founding of the Republic of China was entirely due to the failure to firmly believe in the Prime Minister's principles and policies, and the failure to follow the Prime Minister's revolutionary strategies, which inevitably led to this result. The Prime Minister's profound and comprehensive teachings are truly the only way to save and build the country, and it is an indispensable undertaking that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>From this, it can be known that the Three Principles of the People of our party are the only effective solution for revolutionary nation-building. Before the Republic of China, our party and its principles were used to create the Republic of China. After the Republic of China, our party and its principles are used to defend and build the Republic of China. Anyone who intends to undermine the Republic of China, like Yuan Shikai and his ilk, is a public enemy of our party. In the end, they will inevitably fail. In recent years, rebellions by Long and others have frequently occurred, causing the construction projects to be delayed. Whether the implementation of political tutelage can proceed smoothly in the future, and whether the Prime Minister's wishes can be realized in the shortest possible time, all depend on whether the feudal remnants who disrupt the Republic of China and undermine peaceful unification can have their roots severed in the shortest possible period. All comrades and compatriots across the country should, when commemorating the Zhaohe Uprising today, unanimously recognize the difficult situation of the country, appreciate the arduous environment of the revolution, and further recognize that the victory of this campaign against the rebels is truly a victory for the Three Principles of the People. Support the spirit and enthusiasm of the martyrs in protecting the Republic of China, support the fundamental eradication of reactionaries by the party and government, and ensure that the ghosts and lingering aura of Yuan Shikai no longer haunt the territory of the Republic of China, so that the country can truly be unified and have lasting peace.</p>
<p>Slogans: (1) The Zhaohe Uprising was a courageous struggle against the imperial system and in defense of the Republic of China. (2) The Zhaohe Uprising was a manifestation of the patriotic spirit of the martyrs of our party. (3) The Zhaohe Uprising inherited the spirit of the Xinhai Revolution. (4) The Zhaohe Uprising was the precursor to the Yunnan Uprising. (5) The Zhaohe Uprising was a struggle between democratic forces and the remnants of autocracy. (6) The martyrs who died for the Zhaohe Uprising were the protectors of the Republic of China. (7) Promote the spirit of the Zhaohe Uprising, safeguard the Republic of China, and eliminate feudal reactionary forces. (8) Commemorate the Zhaohe Uprising to consolidate the foundation of the party and the country and promote the construction of political tutelage. (9) Commemorate the Zhaohe Uprising to severely punish Yan and Feng, the traitors who undermined unification and betrayed the central government. (10) Commemorate the Zhaohe Uprising to ensure lasting peace and promote the glory of China.</p>

<h3>The Nanyang Inspection Team Reports on Recent Conditions</h3>
<p>Expressing the Pain of Unequal Customs Duties</p>
<p>The Nanyang Islands National Products Inspection Team, organized by the Shanghai National Products Factory Association, has already departed south. Yesterday, the association received a report from Mr. He Zijing and Mr. Lu Yifei, staff members of the Scientific Instrument Museum, from Singapore. They described the welcome received by local overseas Chinese in Saigon and the inspection of industry and commerce. They particularly lamented the oppression of imperialist tariffs on overseas Chinese. The following is a summary of their report: French Indochina, formerly known as Vietnam, was originally a tributary state of our country. Its territory is divided into three regions: Cochinchina, Annam, and Tonkin. Haiphong in Tonkin is an important gateway to Yunnan. Saigon and Cholon in Cochinchina are important cities in terms of politics and commerce. Annam produces abundant rice, and Saigon is the main export market. There is a train from Saigon to Haiphong and a long-distance bus to Siam, both of which can be reached in one or two hours. It is heartbreaking to see such a beautiful land fall into the hands of foreigners. The currency system of Annam is decimal. One Annam piastre is equivalent to about two Shanghai taels. After the establishment of the National Government, our country abolished the Sino-French Commercial Treaty. For a time, a new treaty was not concluded, and Chinese goods imported into France were taxed according to the example of countries without treaties. Since last year, the tax rate has been increased repeatedly. Any ordinary daily necessities are taxed at 100%, and the valuation is arbitrarily increased or decreased without any basis. Or, taxes are levied by weight, with 96 Annam piastres levied for every 100 kilograms (one kilogram is equivalent to 165 Chinese pounds). For example, a common, plain enamel basin, which costs only 50 or 60 cents in Shanghai, costs 2.5 piastres (equivalent to more than 3 Shanghai dollars) in Saigon, an increase of about six times. However, overseas Chinese are still enthusiastic about adopting them. If the tax issue is resolved, it will be quite beneficial to promote national products. The Sino-French New Treaty was signed last year, but it has not yet been implemented. The team will send a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce after arriving in Singapore, and report to the association to work together to promote the implementation of the Sino-French New Treaty. Currently, the population of Cholon is 700,000, and overseas Chinese account for two-sevenths. Most of the industry and commerce are concentrated here. The group leader, Mr. Zhou Guojun's Nanfeng Company, is located there. Mr. Zhou is young and insightful and is relied upon by our country. The store clerks of Nanfeng are particularly helpful in guiding and directing. The Cholon Cochinchina Chinese General Chamber of Commerce held a tea reception at its hall at 3:00 pm on November 6. The president, vice-president, directors, and more than 30 well-known overseas Chinese businessmen attended. They discussed various ways to promote national products. There is a product showroom behind the chamber's hall, but unfortunately, there are not many items on display and they are very ordinary. The team plans to collect samples from various national product factories after returning to Shanghai and transport them for display to serve as an observation. If our manufacturers can broaden their horizons and make every effort to promote sales overseas, Nanyang will be a very good commercial outlet for our country.</p>
<h3>Japan Strictly Rejects Chinese</h3>
<p>Fujianese Returned</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities are most attentive to people from Fujian who are engaged in labor. If there are any who go there, they are always detained and returned.

<h3>Red Cross Receives Disaster Report from Yu County</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society yesterday received a telegram from various agencies and groups from the Yu County Party Committee and Yu County Government Relief Branch in Henan, reporting that the disaster situation obtained by the Henan Relief Association's investigation was heartbreaking and unbearable to witness. It is urgently disclosed as follows: (omitted) This time, Yan and Feng rebelled, and the overall situation of Yu County's disaster was telegraphed on the 7th of last month, requesting a glimpse. Now, the information obtained from the survey by the River Surface Relief Association will be stated one by one. (1) Population: 1,326 deaths and injuries. (2) Houses burned down: 4,085 rooms, calculated at 20 yuan per room, totaling 81,700 yuan. (3) Felled trees: 20 million trees, calculated at an average of 2 yuan per tree, totaling 400,000 yuan. (4) Forcibly requisitioned hundreds of thousands of civilians, requiring a total of 2.2 million yuan in expenses. (5) Military appropriations: 12 times, totaling 431,808.9 yuan. (6) Requisitioned grain: 14,834,750 catties, totaling 600,8814 yuan. (7) Searched for forage grass: 39,751,717 catties of grass, totaling 293,969 yuan, and 10,945,081 catties of feed, totaling 320,272 yuan. (8) Forcibly conscripted 1,800 soldiers, for a total loss of 180,000 yuan. (9) Forts occupied more than ten hectares of land, estimated at about 6 yuan per mu, totaling more than 6,000 yuan. (10) Loss of property: totaling 2,391,750 yuan. (11) Loss of livestock and vehicles: a total of 19,011 livestock, totaling 953,050 yuan, 5,081 large vehicles, totaling 203,240 yuan, and 2,335 small vehicles, totaling 9,340 yuan. According to statistics, the total loss is 7,849,943 yuan. As for the reduced harvest of the wheat and autumn crops due to the war, the death toll, or the escape of those who have not returned, is not included. It is estimated that the minimum loss in Yu County is more than 10 million yuan. Yu County has a population of 400,000, and each person averages about 30 yuan. The county has a total land area of more than 16,000 hectares. After deducting village bases, roads, sandy roads, and river banks, each person estimates that one mu of land yields a net profit of only about 3 yuan per month. With an income of 3 yuan, it bears a loss of more than 30 yuan, which is far apart. I have waited to reply according to the situation. The tax rate in Yu County is higher than that in the whole province. The historical records have been heavily taxed for 500 years, and the people are poor. In the "Records of Profits and Diseases of the Prefecture and Kingdoms", the county records, and the writings of township elites, the figures are difficult to enumerate. Since the Republic of China, internal wars have been frequent, and there have been requisitions every year. The father is heavier than other counties. In the autumn of the 16th year, there were more than three months of troops stationed on the border of the country, and the losses of supply and incineration in the northeast of the county were also more than 3 million yuan. The vitality was greatly damaged and has not yet recovered. This year's battle is following, and the suffering of searching outside of time is even unprecedented. In this case, after the destruction, it is said that if the levy is not suspended for ten years and a large amount of urgent relief is not issued, it will not be enough to benefit the disaster victims and appease the people. To this day, scholars have stopped studying, farmers sigh in the fields, and merchants have lost their jobs in the markets. The wounds have not yet healed and the escapes have not yet recovered. In addition to telegraphing the central government for special handling, I dare to cry and state the previous situation and implore you to observe the odd disasters and the heavy war disasters, and unanimously appeal to the central government to handle special cases, and to also relieve and assist the orphans or raise huge amounts of money to benefit the orphans. I urgently await orders. The Yu County Party Committee, the County Government Relief Branch, and various agencies and groups of the Kuomintang of China in Yu County, Henan kowtow.</p>
<h3>Record of the Jishi Society Meeting</h3>

It was decided at the last meeting that when the New Year's Day is urgent, a loan of 100,000 yuan can be borrowed to temporarily make up for it, and a loan must be raised according to the plan today to get through the New Year's Day. The disaster relief locations handled this year are Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Liaoning, Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and Beiping. The places where relief funds have not been paid are the Shaanxi Wugong Congee Factory, the Jiangsu Yancheng Winter Relief, the urgent relief in Taizhou, Zhejiang, and the Liaoning Beiping Congee Factory. The society's economy is so tight, and the urgent telegrams from Henan and Shaanxi provinces are flying like snowflakes, which is really against the will. Then, Chairman Wang said that the society's relief is based on conscience and has long been understood by all sectors. In this freezing weather, we can still have warmth and satiety. When we close our eyes and think about the suffering of the victims, how can we not be injured when we have no food when we are hungry and no front when we are cold? All gentlemen, please work hard to carry out the relief. There is no shortage of charitable comrades in Shanghai who will be able to promote the spirit of compatriotism and generously provide relief to the disaster victims. Zhang Weiyuan reported on the assistance to the disaster victims who were left behind in the Yifu Guxi Hua County of Henan, and they will be able to take the Ruiyang Maru to Wuhan tonight.

<h3>Overseas Student Jin Chongling Drowned Himself</h3>
<p>The deceased's belongings arrived in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>Notice to Family Members to Collect and Authenticate</p>
<p>Whether there is a last will is still unknown.</p>
<p>The incident of Jin Chongling, a student studying in Japan, committing suicide by drowning himself has been kept very secret by the Japanese, resulting in very little knowledge of it in society. Now, because the belongings left by the student after his suicide have arrived in Shanghai, the shipping company has notified his family members to come to Shanghai. The following is a brief record of the matter for the reader's information, not to be viewed lightly.</p>
<p>Account of the Drowning Jin Chongling, a student studying in Japan, came from Nanjing to Shanghai to take a ship to Japan. Jin was not very financially well-off, so after arriving in Shanghai, he chose a ship with a cheaper ticket to cross the sea. The ship Jin took was the Sansaka Maru, a third-class cargo ship of the Japanese Post Office in this city, bound for Kobe. This ship had cheaper passenger tickets than the Shanghai Maru and other ships. After Jin boarded the ship, there was initially nothing unusual. However, when the ship reached the Yellow Sea, in the dead of night, amidst the sound of the turbulent waves, he sneaked out of the third-class cabin and climbed onto the deck and jumped into the sea. At that time, the ship was traveling very fast, so very few people knew about it.</p>
<p>The Body Was Not Recovered Passengers in the third-class cabin all live in the same cabin. After Jin Chongling drowned himself, some of his cabinmates noticed that he had left the cabin and had not returned. Suspecting something, they reported it to the crew members. After detailed investigation, the person was nowhere to be found. They searched the room and found a suicide note, but it did not mention the reason. At this time, it was late at night and the sea was wide and the sky was vast, and there was no way to recover the body. They had to leave it alone and only report it to the head office after arriving in Japan.</p>
<p>Baggage Sent to Taiwan by Mistake When the Sansaka Maru arrived in Japan, the shipowner collected his belongings and items in one place and immediately ordered them to be transferred to the Japanese Post Office ship returning to Shanghai so as to notify his family to come and claim them. Unexpectedly, in a hurry, Jin's luggage was mistakenly delivered to the Asahi Maru and taken to Keelung, Taiwan by the Asahi Maru. After discovering the mistake, it had already traveled thousands of nautical miles. It was brought back to Japan and then transferred to Shanghai again.</p>
<p>Notice to Jin's Family This trip was originally brought back to Kobe by the Asahi Maru, and then transferred to a Shanghai-bound ship. It was not brought to Shanghai until yesterday. The Japanese Post Office found that his family was in Nanjing, so it temporarily stored his luggage at the Shanghai warehouse and sent a letter from the agency to inform his family, Jin Shaowei reported that Jin Chongling had committed suicide by drowning and the reason was unknown. Whether there is a suicide note in the luggage, wait for the family to arrive at Shanghai Yangshupu No. 31, the warehouse, to claim it and then open it by themselves to clarify the truth. It also stated that the reason why the luggage was delayed and the notification was delayed was due to the mistaken delivery to the Taiwanese post ship. This letter will be sent by express delivery this morning. After his family arrives in Shanghai to open the luggage, the reason for Jin Chongling's suicide by drowning may be known.</p>
<h3>Fan Yichun of Qibao Town Goes Missing</h3>
<p>Four people came on bicycles</p>
<p>They dragged Fan away on the way</p>
<p>No news for two days</p>
<p>Fan Yichun, the owner of Fan Yongjihao, a shop in Qibao Town, Shanghai, is 28 years old. He has a wife and children and is of modest wealth, known as a petty bourgeois. He is particularly timid and does not have many friends. At around 2 PM on the first day of this month, Fan went out alone to visit the Zhang family, his wife's family, in Changbang. After an hour, Fan said goodbye and returned. On the way, he passed Guanyintang (a necessary road for going back and forth, near Qibao). He stopped at a friend's house and sat for a while before leaving for home. Unexpectedly, he had not walked a few steps when four people on bicycles sped up from behind and stopped Fan on the road. Without a word, they dragged Fan Yichun away. Afterwards, his family waited until late at night but did not see Fan return, and were greatly alarmed because Fan never stayed out overnight. The next morning, his family sent out scouts to inquire along the way. When they reached Guanyintang, they learned from the villagers who witnessed the incident that at around 3 PM on the first day, Fan was suddenly dragged away by four people on bicycles and disappeared without a word. The four people had been wandering around this area for several days. Furthermore, they repeatedly inquired and only said that the four people were from a certain organization. Then his family visited again and again to find out where they were, but there was still no whereabouts after two days. Therefore, his family is extremely anxious.</p>
<h3>Counter-Revolutionary Elements Arrested in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters received a confidential report stating that a large number of counter-revolutionary elements were hiding at No. 14 Ximenli, Bailaini Mengmalang Road, French Concession, plotting wrongdoing. The Commander immediately ordered the detective team of the headquarters to select competent personnel to take a car and request assistance from the special agency of the French Police. The head of the police station immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives from the political department to go together and found a variety of red counter-revolutionary leaflets in the house at No. 14, titled "Initiating the Memorial Guangzhou Uprising Southern French District Representatives' Congress Report to the People," with a thousand words in a similar counter-revolutionary tone, signed by the (Preparatory Office for the Memorial Guangzhou Uprising Southern French District Printing). Two people were arrested on the spot, one named Zhang Jingbo and one named Jiang Dayun, both from Xuzhou, and taken to the police station for temporary detention. After a brief interrogation in the courthouse this morning, they will be transferred to the garrison headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Old Dalai Returns to the United States This Morning</h3>
<p>Opening Sino-American Air-Sea Combined Flights</p>
<p>Mr. Labour White Dalai, the owner of Dalai Foreign Firm, came to China this time to investigate the development of Far East trade and the Oriental shipping industry. He had contacted important figures of the National Government in the capital. Yesterday, because his work was completed, he took the Tatuo ship of his firm back to the United States. The expansion of business and the situation of returning to the country and leaving Shanghai are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>New Ships Sailing Sino-American Competition in the Pacific navigation industry is the fiercest this year. Each firm is building high-speed ships to sail. Mr. Dalai is also using 30 million US dollars to build two new 26,000-ton postal ships with a speed of 23 knots each, and according to the new method of the Atlantic Ocean, each of the two ships is equipped with two seaplanes for picking up and sending passengers and mail. For example, if the ship has arrived in Japan, Shanghai passengers can still be sent by plane, or those who have important matters that need to arrive at the destination first can also be changed from ship to plane. This kind of air-sea combined flight is the first in the Far East. One of the two ships has been launched and the other will be launched next month. In about six months, the route from San Francisco to Shanghai can be added. This is to arrange the procedures for the new ship's sailing schedule in advance.</p>
<p>Building a Radio Station The firm's business in China is huge, and the number of ships coming and going is increasing day by day. There are so many telegrams for its own use that it has decided to establish a radio station in Shanghai. However, in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Communications, it is limited to the firm's own ships. The materials have been shipped to Shanghai in batches and the radio station will be built immediately. Mr. Dalai's visit to Beijing this time was to contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications to discuss this matter. It is heard that there has been a result.</p>
<p>Staff Arrived in Port to See Off After the Shanghai Groups Held a Public Banquet Yesterday, Mr. Dalai went to the company on Guangdong Road in the morning and talked with the Chinese director Wu Hongyuan and Chuan Shengyuan for an hour. He discussed and planned a lot on business, and then ordered the company's Taft ship to set sail one day earlier this morning because he had to rush to San Francisco for Christmas. All the staff of the Shanghai company went to the port to see him off on the ship.</p>
<p>Leaving Shanghai for the United States This Morning Mr. Dalai, his wife and secretary took a small steamboat from the Xinguang Wharf to Yangshupu Hetong last night and transferred to the Taft big ship. Shanghai foreman Steve accompanied Mr. Dalai to Kobe, Japan, and then returned to Shanghai. Mr. Dalai went directly across the Pacific Ocean back to San Francisco. The ship left port at 7 am this morning.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Responds to the Batavia General Chamber of Commerce Letter Regarding the Xiao Case</h3>
<p>Definitely not to expand on the basis of the situation</p>
<p>Actually seeking equal treatment</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce explained the true meaning of the anti-Dutch movement in the Xiao case and yesterday replied to the Batavia Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in a letter saying that it received a large letter from Zhan on the 2nd of this month saying that the Xiao case was only an indecent act by the crew of the Java Company. China and the Netherlands have always been friendly and it seems that it should not be over-expanded to affect the whole body. The various sectors requested the council to telegraph the information on their behalf. A copy of the original telegram is attached, hoping to forward it to all sectors and asking for a reply, etc. Under the rule of the countries where they are stationed, the opinions and actions of overseas Chinese in the Dutch colonies are severely restricted. This time, the overseas Chinese merchants strongly requested that the Xiao case should not be expanded too much, and there are difficulties of their own. The Chamber of Commerce and the merchants under its jurisdiction also deeply understand the difficulties of the position of the Chamber. However, considering that the taxation and other treatments of overseas Chinese compatriots who do business and reside in the Dutch colonies in Nanyang cannot be equal to those of Europeans and Japanese, but instead are reduced to being with the natives, the descriptions in newspapers and magazines and the spread of those who returned to the country for investigation are all true and reliable. Anyone with a bit of blood will be indignant and heartbroken. Because of the weakness of the national power, there is no way to clean up the situation and regret is used as a sigh. The layer of friendship between China and the Netherlands quoted in the letter seems not to be entirely true. The relationship between countries and the friendship between individuals are the same, and it can only be said to be true friendship if equal treatment can actually be achieved. This time, the humiliation of Ms. Xiao is a microcosm of the Dutch's long-standing contempt for the Chinese nation. The domestic public opinion in this case is to seek the cause of the fruit. On the one hand, we should try our best to punish the murderers and apologize to Ms. Xiao in order to stretch the law slightly. On the other hand, we should take this opportunity to try our best to seek equal treatment for the Chinese nation and overseas Chinese in the Netherlands, so that those who come to the south will not repeat the same mistakes, and the position of the overseas Chinese merchants in the Netherlands can be invisibly increased in the future and will no longer be treated like the natives of the past. All of these are considerations for the overall interests of the overseas Chinese compatriots in the Netherlands and are definitely not intentionally aggressive and want to use the Xiao case as a sign. This situation is that overseas Chinese compatriots are far away from the motherland, and it is not easy for domestic newspapers to popularize in Nanyang, so there is a lack of close understanding. It is inevitable that they will mistakenly think that the domestic boycott of Dutch ships is a show of expansion. Dare to briefly state the general situation and attach a copy of the minutes of the meeting of the various sectors of the country to support Xiao and the anti-Dutch support association and reply in a letter. I hope that you will check it. Sincerely, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Batavia.</p>
<h3>Zou Dexin Sentenced to Imprisonment in Wuxi Huge Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Zou Dexin, the owner of Lin'an Hotel at No. 251 Guangdong Road, this city, falsely used the Wuxi Nanxiang Xiaoqiaotou huge kidnapping case to intimidate Zhou Yuquan (aka A Gen), the manager of Shenjiang Hotel on Hankou Road and Xin Su Hotel on Hubei Road, and attempted to extort 5,000 yuan. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. After a first trial by the Special District Local Court, Zou Dexin was detained for investigation. Yesterday was the date of the continued trial. The plaintiff Zhou Yuquan extended the French Doctor of Law, Ren Zhennan, as his lawyer to appear in court and state the details. The defendant Zou Dexin also extended his lawyer to defend him and request a declaration of Zou Dexin's innocence. Following the mutual debate between the police lawyer Ru Baohui Yi, the plaintiff's lawyer Ren Zhennan, and the defendant's extended lawyer, the presiding judge Zhou announced that the defendant Zou Dexin would be sentenced to ten months' imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>Peng Daxun et al. Petition for Prompt Prosecution</h3>
<p>The family members of the victims of the Fuchang Military Uniform Factory, Peng Daxun, Hao Shouzhi, etc., entrusted lawyer Yan Lunkui to file a complaint against the factory authorities Wu Desheng, etc. The Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate held a hearing on the 26th and 27th of last month. The results of the interrogation showed that the factory was indeed at fault for causing this huge disaster. In addition to ordering Wu Desheng to pay 20,000 yuan for guarantee pending trial, he also comforted each of the victimized family members and orally ordered them to file a lawsuit according to the law on the same day. However, another week has passed. In order to seek a quick solution, the family members specially asked lawyer Yan to draft a petition to urge the lawsuit. The petition is as follows:</p>
<p>To re-state the grievances and plead for prompt prosecution according to law, Da Xun et al.'s lawsuit against Wu Desheng et al. of the Fuchang Military Uniform Factory was heard by Junchu on the 26th and 27th of last month, and Junchu orally ordered to file a public prosecution to the same-level trial court according to law on the same day. It is obvious that justice is there and will never allow cunning people to be at large outside the law, and Junchu's national legislative spirit is to rescue the suffering and punish the evil and punish the evil, making the three generations of justice return to today. Under the rule of the Chinese Kuomintang, each individual right of Daxun and others has the guarantee of legal equality, and it is more believed that the pine and chrysanthemum cannot compete with the peach and plum, and the poor people cannot litigate with the rich for a long time. It goes without saying that if they do not litigate, Daxun and others will not be able to appease their grief and anger, and dozens of wronged ghosts will enter the city of wrongful death, so how can they rest in peace? Moreover, most of the general burn victims, both men and women, have become disabled. They lack the resources for medicine and lack the savings of dou and sheng. The disease and cold are intertwined, and their lives are uncertain. It is not necessary to say more. For this reason, in addition to A Jin Xiao Sheng et al. quietly waiting for the summons, a certain number must reiterate the grievances and plead for Junchu to show mercy and file a lawsuit according to law as soon as possible, so that they can be tried as soon as possible, sentenced as soon as possible, relieved from litigation as soon as possible, and obtain fair relief as soon as possible. Please, the undersigned, Peng Daxun, Hao Shouzhi, et al.'s private prosecution agent lawyer Yan Lunkui, December 3, 19th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Two-Road Police Investigation Bureau Cracked Many Theft Cases</h3>
<p>Fan and Rong, the two chief investigators of the two-road police, have paid great attention to the prevention of the two roads. Recently, because of the theft cases of passengers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou train, they strictly ordered their subordinates to solve the case within a time limit. Yesterday, Jin and Zhu, two criminals, were released from the third section of the Beijing-Shanghai line. After interrogation, they confessed and confessed to stealing silver and clothes from several pawns on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. They are currently living at a certain number on Maigen Road. Personnel were immediately dispatched to cooperate with the police to raid the address and search for stolen clothes and pawn tickets. After first redeeming a part of the stolen goods and submitting them to the Special District Court for certification, the criminals were extradited to the master case yesterday to inform the victims such as Li for claiming them. It is heard that there are still many stolen goods redeemed to inform the lost customers to claim them.</p>
<h3>Qiu Dingbao Requests Analysis of Inheritance Case Appeal</h3>
<p>Judge advises reconciliation</p>
<p>Limited time to consider five days</p>
<p>Qiu Dingbao, the niece of the late paint tycoon Qiu Weiqing, requested that her brother Qiu Shensan divide the inheritance of her deceased father, but failed to do so. She then filed a lawsuit. The first instance judgment ordered Shensan to divide 10,000 yuan. Dingbao believed that her father's inheritance was 3 million, and even if it was as her brother said, it would be a million, but only getting 10,000 yuan was hard to convince her. Therefore, she filed an appeal. Then, for some unknown reason, she suddenly applied to withdraw the appeal. However, Shensan was still unwilling to sacrifice 10,000 yuan and also filed an appeal, causing Dingbao to re-file a collateral appeal, which was quite suspicious. Later, the High Court repeatedly opened the court, but Shensan never arrived. The presiding judge did not want the case to be suspended and issued a summons recently stating that if he refused to appear again, he would be detained and a hearing was scheduled for yesterday afternoon. Shensan, upon learning that he could not avoid it, but did not want to confront his sister in court, submitted a request to withdraw the appeal in advance. The High Court held that Dingbao had already filed a collateral appeal, so the court was still opened as scheduled. Judge Hu asked whether your brother had withdrawn the appeal, and what was your claim? Dingbao immediately said that even if her brother withdrew, she would have to proceed. Judge Hu then advised that she should value the relationship between siblings, that money was an external thing. If you withdraw the appeal now, you can get the 10,000 yuan that was judged in the first instance. If you insist on litigation, it will take time, and the final victory is still unknown. If you think that your brother owns an inheritance of 3 million, you should also provide evidence and cannot rely on your empty words. However, Dingbao still did not give a definite indication. The judge then gave her a five-day deadline for her to consider. If she wanted to reconcile, she should submit a letter withdrawing the appeal within the deadline. Otherwise, she should submit a statement within the deadline and invite witnesses to wait for the scheduled hearing. Dingbao heard the instructions and retreated with her husband.</p>
<h3>One Piece of Paper as Currency Leads to Severe Punishment</h3>
<p>Rice Steward Wrongfully Takes Blame for a Friend</p>
<p>Attorney Li Files an Appeal</p>
<p>Lu Quan, a rice steward at the Lihua Company, was recently involved in an incident. A friend, Tan Hong, was leading a child on Nanjing Road and, due to the heavy traffic, found it inconvenient to cross the street to buy something. He gave Lu Quan a ten-yuan banknote to purchase two dozen cakes and two pounds of bread at Sullivan's. However, the banknote turned out to be counterfeit, and Sullivan discovered it. When asked where he got it, Lu Quan explained that a friend had asked him to buy the items just across the street. Sullivan refused to let Lu Quan leave and, without further explanation, called the police to arrest him. The police handed him over to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court. The court scheduled a hearing for the 18th of last month and appointed Attorney Jin Yu as the pro bono defender. However, Attorney Jin was in Suzhou on business that day and requested Attorney Li Yuan to represent him. Attorney Li reported to the court before the hearing, but the court, without waiting for Attorney Li Yuan to legally appear and defend, directly sentenced Lu Quan to two years and six months of imprisonment, and the counterfeit banknote was confiscated and marked as evidence. It is now reported that the convicted Lu Quan is dissatisfied with the verdict, and Attorney Li, citing Article 306 of the Criminal Procedure Law, argues that the original defender and representative, for the benefit of the defendant, may file an appeal on his behalf. Furthermore, according to the police's indictment, the minimum sentence for the crime is five years or more. Therefore, according to Article 107 of the Criminal Procedure Law, since a defense attorney was appointed by the court, the First Court's verdict without waiting for the attorney to appear and defend is a clear violation of Item 9 of Article 391 of the Criminal Law. It is argued that the appellant's criminal suspicion rests only on one counterfeit banknote, without active proof. Even the police attorney, Ru Bao Yi, argued that the punishment was too severe if treating the offense at its lightest. Therefore, based on these reasons, an appeal has been filed with the Higher Branch Court, requesting that the original judgment be overturned and a new judgment be issued.</p>
<h3>Female Worker at Yongan Factory Dies Suddenly, Autopsy Conducted</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 2nd) afternoon at around 5 PM, at the No. 2 Yongan Spinning Factory in Wusong Yunzaobang, a young female worker was found suddenly collapsed at the main entrance behind the factory during the shift dismissal. The gatekeeper immediately reported to Inspector Shi stationed at the factory, who arrived to find her already dead. Her fellow villagers then carried her body to an open space beside the workshop behind. It was discovered that there was a pair of trousers twisted five times around her neck, but not knotted. Yesterday morning, the meal contractor, Zhang Gengquan, filed a report with the First Precinct of the Public Security Bureau, stating: "I, Zhang Gengquan, 38 years old, from Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, live in workshop number 124 and am a meal contractor. The female worker was brought here by me from my hometown. Her name is Zhang Jingli, 17 years old, also from Dongyang. On the previous day (the 1st), she worked the night shift. The next day, at the end of the shift, she was fined five jiao by foreman Tao Kewei for being lazy. After returning home, the female worker did not eat any porridge or rice all day. After 5 PM, she went out to work at the factory and soon died." Director Zhang Jiguang then went to the scene of the death with the local security officer, Yu Anlian, to inspect the area. He immediately ordered Yu to report to the Shanghai Local Court and request them to send someone to Songjiang to investigate the true cause of death for verification. Because there was no time to report yesterday, the autopsy will likely take place this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Old Man Attempts Suicide by Hanging from a Holly Tree</h3>
<p>Fortunately Saved by Patrol Police</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 6 AM, an old man was found hanging himself from a holly tree among the weeds in a deserted grave area west of Jiaotong Road in Zhabei. His body was suspended in the air, a truly terrifying sight. Fortunately, the patrol police of the Third Precinct of the Fourth District spotted him and rushed forward to save him. He had not yet died. They took him to the police station, and after several hours of treatment, he regained consciousness. When questioned by the director, he gave his name as Li Wanghua, 50 years old, from Gong'an County, Hubei Province. He was once a merchant with a wife and children. However, due to financial difficulties, he resolutely left for other provinces to seek work. Unfortunately, after traveling to Shanghai, he not only had nowhere to live but also lacked food and clothing. Now, his pockets were empty, and he had no one to borrow from. With the harsh winter weather, he felt that he would eventually die, so he used his belt to hang himself from the tree. As he spoke, he shed tears of sorrow. The director, seeing his plight as pitiful, ordered him to be sent to the judicial department for further handling.</p>
<h3>Case of Tao Dongfu Killed by Car</h3>

When questioned, Chen Liangcai claimed that he was driving slowly that day, but the deceased was careless. The Chinese and Western judges adjourned the court to await further judgment.</p>
<h3>Capture of Robbers in Tangjia Lane</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, at 6 PM, two robbers suddenly appeared at the entrance of Tangjia Lane on Qipu Road. Seeing a noodle stall there, they sat down. The stall owner, Ying Laosan, and his wife, Ying Xu, were attentive to the customers' needs. The two robbers each ate a bowl of noodles. After finishing, one robber pointed a gun to prevent the Ying couple from making any noise, while the other searched for valuables, finding only 5,000 copper coins, which was not enough. They then robbed Ying's wife of a gold ring and a pair of gold bracelets. Wang Xiaoyu, who was also eating noodles at the stall, had his felt hat snatched by the robbers, who then fled. Li Along, a passerby who witnessed the scene, helped chase after them. The robber with the gun fired a shot to resist arrest. The sound of the shot alerted the Chinese police at numbers 1927, 1938, and 789 nearby, who surrounded and captured the robber with the gun. He abandoned his weapon and fled but was eventually caught and taken back to the Huishi Police Station. Under questioning, the robber confessed to being Bi Yongcheng from Jiangbei, while the unarmed robber escaped without a trace. Later, Li Along found the gun discarded by the robber on the road and handed it over to the police station. Yesterday, the couple Ying and Wang, and Li, all appeared in court as witnesses. The police attorney, Wang Yaotang, briefly presented the case and requested a postponement for further investigation. Judge Wu questioned Bi Yongcheng and ordered him to be detained for further questioning in seven days.</p>

<h3>The Report of the Shanghai Ratepayers' Association on the Audit of the Water Company's Accounts</h3>
<p>He De Kui, Pan Xu Lun, and Yu Xi Ji, the three representatives of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai Concession, submitted a written report to the association after auditing the accounts of the Water Company as follows: I. Audit Report of the Shanghai Water Company</p>
<p>Section 1: The Origin of the Audit: The Shanghai Public Concession Water Company uniformly increased the water rates for users within the concession by 25% starting in September of this year. The citizens protested, and the undersigned were entrusted by the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai Concession and the Shanghai Real Estate Association to audit the Water Company's accounts. Starting at the end of September, we went to the company daily to review the account books and registers from 1915 to 1929. Later, the company failed to submit the final accounts for the first half of this year immediately, delaying the process for more than twenty days. The audit is now complete, and the details of the process and the results obtained are reported as follows. (The company's shareholder meeting reports for the last 15 years are attached.)</p>
<p>Section 2: The Reasons Why the Water Company Believes It Should Increase Prices: The Water Company's reasons for increasing prices are that the price of gold has risen, and the annual dividends are calculated in British currency. The amount of silver used to pay dividends has also increased accordingly, and a portion of the various expenses has also increased due to the rise in the price of gold, resulting in the original surplus amount being insufficient for distribution. Therefore, it is necessary to increase prices. The company's capital stock totals £1,163,225, and the fixed annual dividend is £100,020 3s. Currently, calculated at a rate of one shilling sixpence per tael, a total of 1,333,602 taels of silver is required. The estimated income for this year is 2,600,000 taels, and the net profit after deducting all expenses is 689,029 taels. Adding the accumulated surplus of 379,884 taels over the years, the total amount is still 264,689 taels short of the fixed dividend for this year. If this shortfall is extended to next year and added to next year's fixed dividend of 1,333,602 taels (still calculated at a rate of one shilling sixpence per tael), a total of 1,598,291 taels of silver will be required. The estimated income for next year is 2,780,000 taels, and the net profit after deducting all expenses is only 542,000 taels. Using this to pay dividends will result in a significant shortfall of 1,056,291 taels. To make up for this shortfall, the water price must be increased by 30.8% from October of this year to the end of next year. This clause is based on the company's estimate that the dividend is insufficient based on an exchange rate of one shilling sixpence per tael, and the company is trying to find ways to increase revenue. (Note: The Municipal Council has agreed to the Water Company's price increase of 25% from September of this year to the end of next year. If the exchange rate rises to two shillings per tael, the price increase will be reconsidered.) Section 3: Results of the Audit: (1) The benefits obtained by the company's shareholders in the past were overly generous. (2) The current dividend rate of the company has been set by the Municipal Council, that is, its dividends have been guaranteed by the Municipal Council and shall not be reduced. In fact, the benefits obtained by shareholders have not decreased compared with the past, but have been guaranteed. (3) The company's expenses have increased excessively. The above Item 1 has proof from the following facts: (A) The average annual dividend is more than 10%. The following table lists the Class A dividends distributed by the company in the past 15 years:</p>
<p>Year Dividend Bonus Water Supply Extra Benefit Total</p>
<p>(Percent) (Percent) (Percent)</p>
<p>1915 12.00 0.50 12.50</p>
<p>1916 12.00 1.125 13.125</p>
<p>1917 12.00 2.50 14.50</p>
<p>1918 12.00 0.625 12.625</p>
<p>1919 12.50 4.00 17.50</p>
<p>1920 12.50 0.30 13.00</p>
<p>1921 10.00 10.00</p>
<p>1922 7.50 7.50</p>
<p>1923 5.00 5.00</p>
<p>1924 10.00 10.00</p>
<p>1925 10.00 1.25 11.25</p>
<p>1926 10.00 10.00</p>
<p>1927 8.30 1.56 9.86</p>
<p>1928 9.70 1.56 11.26</p>
<p>1929 9.00 1.29 10.29</p>
<p>The average rate for the above 15 years is 11.23%. The average rate for the past 10 years is 9.82%. The average rate for the past 5 years is 10.53%. This is the officially paid dividend and bonus. (B) Distribution of Bonus Shares Twice: The company distributed bonus shares twice in 1921 and 1926 (3,048 shares in 1921, each share at £20, totaling £60,960; 6,706 shares in 1926, each share at £20, totaling £134,120), totaling 9,754 shares, totaling £195,080, accounting for more than 24% of the company's current Class A shares. This bonus share was allocated from the surplus reserve fund and distributed evenly according to the number of shares originally held by the shareholders, without any consideration. Its rights are exactly the same as the originally issued shares. This reserve fund comes from the premiums on previous stock issues, and a portion is from the earnings of previous years. The investor is willing to pay a premium because of (1) the company's excellent reputation, (2) the stability of public utility investment, and (3) the ability to pay high dividends over the years. Once this premium is received, it is the same as the company's ordinary earnings and is indistinguishable from the company's reserve fund. In fact, the stock premium is paid by a portion of new shareholders, and the bonus share is enjoyed equally by old and new shareholders. It is an allocation of earnings and cannot be explained as a return of original capital. There is no doubt about it. Therefore, in addition to the dividends paid annually, the Class A shares also have the benefit of these two lump-sum distributions. Last year, the dividend income of Class A shares was 9% fixed interest and 1.29% bonus, totaling 10.29%. If this 24% bonus share is excluded, the dividend income of the inherited shares is 13.5%, and its benefit is very generous. (C) Distribution of Dividends of Shanghai Water Appliances Limited Company: Before 1926, the company had a department that sold water appliances. Later, the Municipal Council and the company agreed to reorganize the water appliance department separately. The value of all assets in this department, totaling 200,180 taels, was allocated to establish the Shanghai Water Appliances Limited Company, and stocks of the same amount were issued and distributed to the Class A shareholders of the Water Company at that time. The business of the appliance company has developed rapidly in recent years, and the dividends are also quite generous. This is also an additional benefit for the shareholders of the company. To sum up the three points, it is self-evident that the benefits obtained by the company's shareholders in the past were overly generous. The above Item 2 has the following facts to prove: (A) Dividends Allowed by the Municipal Council: The company's current total capital stock is £1,163,215, and the shares are divided into Class A, Class B, and Class C. Class A shares have a par value of £20 each, totaling 40,236 shares, accounting for nearly 70% of the total capital stock. They were issued the earliest, and the benefits are also the most generous. Class B shares were issued after 1926, with a par value of £1 each, totaling 108,505 shares, accounting for nearly 10% of the total capital stock. Class C shares were allowed by the Municipal Council to be issued in 1929, with a par value of £1 each, totaling 250,000 shares, accounting for more than 20% of the total capital stock. In March 1928, the Municipal Council and the company signed a 20-year contract, which stipulates the following regarding dividends: Class A shares are guaranteed 9% interest and can receive bonuses, Class B shares are guaranteed 7% interest and can also receive bonuses, and Class C shares are guaranteed 8% interest and have no bonus rights. The guaranteed interest rate is like this. (B) Bonuses Allowed by the Municipal Council: The contract also stipulates that the water rates collected in the concession must be approved by the Municipal Council. The company is free to set prices for water used by users outside the concession and various ships. The profits obtained by the company from supplying water to users outside the concession and various ships are used to distribute dividends to shareholders, that is, the bonus of Class A and Class B shares mentioned in Item A. This bonus was 1.56% in 1928 and 1.29% in 1929, which is the same for Class A and Class B shares. Therefore, the actual dividend issued for Class A shares is no more than 9%, and the actual dividend issued for Class B shares is more than 7%. In the above two items, the dividends obtained by Class A shares (accounting for 70% of the total shares) in the past two years are as follows:</p>
<p>Year Fixed Interest Bonus (Water Outside Concession) Total Dividend</p>
<p>1928 9.00% 1.56% 10.56%</p>
<p>1929 9.00% 1.29% 10.29%</p>
<p>Note: There is also a 7% dividend to compensate for the shortfall in 1927. The right Class A dividend rate is almost the same as the average rate of 10.67% for the ten years from 1918 to 1927. Compared with the average rate of 9.22% for the five years from 1923 to 1927, it has increased. Moreover, there was no guarantee for the amount of dividends paid by the company in the past. After the contract signed in March 1928, the dividends received by shareholders have an additional guarantee. (C) Dividends of the Water Appliances Limited Company Allowed by the Municipal Council: The stocks of the Water Appliances Company mentioned in Item C of the previous Item 1 were previously issued to the shareholders of the Water Company, and the benefits they receive each year are allowed by the Municipal Council to be distributed as usual. The facts of the above Item 3 are as follows: The amount of water supplied by the Water Company was 10,809,519,328 gallons in 1925 and 13,147,724,477 gallons in 1929. The increase in five years is about 22%. As for the annual expenses, they are shown in the table on the left:</p>
<p>Year Water Production Cost Water Delivery Cost Management Cost Total</p>
<p>(Tael) (Tael) (Tael)</p>
<p>1925 490,563.02 102,916.31 20,362.69 863,912.03</p>
<p>1926 535,409.62 114,879.00 16,686.89 966,975.51</p>
<p>1927 571,415.44 114,952.23 22,055.06 1,118,422.73</p>
<p>1928 501,466.21 134,363.34 46,807.44 1,100,636.98</p>
<p>1929 565,568.75 156,460.89 53,450.00 1,125,479.67</p>
<p>Compared with 1929 and</p>
<p>1925, the increase rate is 15% 50% 90% 42%</p>
<p>According to the table above, the increase rate of each expense is compared with the increase rate of water output. Except that the increase of water production cost is less, the water delivery cost and management cost are much higher. Furthermore, the rate of increase of certain items of expenses of the company is even greater than this. For example, the amount paid for salaries and wages under the management fee item has the following table from 1925 to this year:</p>
<p>Tael</p>
<p>1925 150,330.85</p>
<p>1926 185,046.58</p>
<p>1927 234,147.78</p>
<p>1928 256,693.88</p>
<p>1929 283,636.60</p>
<p>First Half of 1930 187,181.07</p>
<p>Budget for Second Half of 1930 224,617.28</p>
<p>The increase in salaries and wages is very large. Compared with 1929 and 1925, the increase is 89%. Comparing the first half of this year with the previous year, it is 32% higher. The company's budget for the second half of this year has increased by another 20%. If this budget is implemented, the salary for the second half of this year or next year will increase by three times compared with 1925. Although the salary of some senior employees of the company is calculated in gold pounds and increases according to the exchange rate change, it does not have to be so large. The factory repair and maintenance costs in the following table:</p>
<p>Tael</p>
<p>1925 11,004.83</p>
<p>1926 10,876.95</p>
<p>1927 28,966.03</p>
<p>1928 83,260.76</p>
<p>1929 98,960.11</p>
<p>The expenses in 1929 increased by 9 times compared with 1925. During this period, the increase in fixed assets such as houses, machines, and water pipes was only 14%, and the increase in water output was only 22%. As for the impact of the gold-expensive and silver-cheap, the average exchange rate in 1925 was 3 shillings and 1 and a half pence, and the average exchange rate in 1929 was 2 shillings and 4 pence and 19/32. The increase was only 31%, and only a portion of the repair and maintenance costs are affected by the gold price. In addition, the increase in expenses such as the return travel expenses of foreign employees and the miscellaneous expenses of the management office is also very rapid. From this, it can be seen that the company's expenses have increased greatly. Therefore, it is questionable whether the company has done its best to save money.</p>
<p>Section 4: Audit Opinions: (1) According to the above section, the benefits obtained by the company's shareholders in the past and present are too generous. The facts in the past are as above. The current dividend for Class A shares is guaranteed 9% interest, and the bonus for water supply outside the concession is already more than 10%. The dividends of the appliance company and the bonus shares issued in the past are not included. Such a generous dividend is rare for public utilities enjoying a patent. The market price of the company's Class A shares in London this year is about £25, which is 25% higher than the par value. This is clear proof that investors consider the interest rate to be generous. (2) Public utilities should do their best to save on various expenses, because saving one cent reduces the burden on citizens by one cent. In recent years, the company has not been able to practice thrift in terms of expenditure, and has focused on increasing revenue, requesting price increases, which is difficult to satisfy people. (3) The company's estimated total income for this year is 2,600,000 taels, and the dividends to be paid are 1,333,602 taels, accounting for more than 50% of the total water price income. Therefore, more than half of the water price paid by citizens is used for the company to pay dividends. The company's capital stock and dividends must be calculated in British currency. The rise and fall of the gold price are uncertain, and the water price borne by citizens is subject to the risk of changes in the gold price. The annual water price cannot be estimated, and it is necessary to prepare a budget and calculate the loss to citizens based on the gold price, which is detrimental to the interests of citizens and has an impediment. For a fundamental solution, it is necessary to have a comprehensive cost calculation. Report by He De Kui, Pan Xu Lun, and Yu Xi Ji, November 21, 1930.</p>

<h3>Jiao Hill Sightseeing Record</h3>
<p>— Yue Jiang</p>
<p>On the 29th, Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Yu Fengzhi, arrived from the capital on the warship "Hai Xing" to visit Jiao Hill. Among those accompanying him were Song Ziwen, Yang Shuzhuang, Hu Ruoyu, and many other important figures. The arrival of these dignitaries added luster to the scenic Jiangshan. The following is a miscellaneous record of the lively events of those few hours, which the reader will surely be pleased to hear.</p>
<p>Cannon Fire in the Thick Fog　News of Deputy Commander Zhang's visit to Jiao Hill was scarcely known beforehand. Around noon, a sudden, resounding cannon fire reverberated, startling the people. Unaware of the details, they ran around spreading the news, inquiring about what had happened. It was then learned that the Xiangshan Fort was firing cannons in salute to Deputy Commander Zhang. At the time, thick fog covered the Yangtze River, and it was unknown that the "Hai Xing" warship had already docked near Jiao Hill.</p>
<p>Many Dignitaries at Jiao Hill　Before Mr. Zhang's arrival, Chairman Ye and the heads of various departments had already taken the "Da Ya" patrol ship to Jiao Hill to await his arrival. Jiao Hill is located far in the heart of the river, and visitors often found it difficult to cross the water, so it was usually rarely visited, and felt desolate and quiet, indeed showing its deep mountain nature. This time, with the concentration of military and political dignitaries, the famous temple attracted more visitors than ever before, and Jiao Hill truly became a lively hill.</p>
<p>The Monks Extremely Busy　The lunch was originally ordered from the Meili Society Western restaurant by the provincial government, but because many found it unappetizing and not in line with the characteristics of Jiao Hill, and unsuitable to adorn the scenic spot, it was changed to a vegetarian meal of five tables prepared by the Dinghui Temple itself. The monks were already extremely busy pouring tea and water, and then they began to prepare the vegetarian meal, working hastily to meet the overwhelming demand.</p>
<p>Gifts and Requests from the Monks　After lunch at the Zhenjiang Pavilion, the abbot, Ji Tang, led the group on a tour of various places, explaining the various historical sites in detail, and presented various rubbings from stone inscriptions as gifts. Mr. Zhang accepted them all to keep as mementos. The abbot also presented a scroll, requesting Mr. Zhang to inscribe it. He immediately wrote the four characters "(Justice and Righteousness Endure)," and signed it "Zhang Xueliang." The brushstrokes were vigorous and full of heroic spirit, truly befitting a general. After the tour, Mr. Zhang immediately ordered his staff to give 1,000 yuan to support the temple, and awarded 200 yuan to the provincial government's guard team, and 100 yuan to the provincial government's military band, totaling no less than 1,400 or 1,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui's Portrait and Poem</h3>
<p>— Yan Yun</p>
<p>The articles of the famous figure of the Party and State, Mr. Wu Zhihui, use simple language to convey profound truths, and his eloquence is known throughout the world. However, his poems are rarely circulated. This April, Xu Beihong of Yixing created an oil painting of him, about three feet high, full of spirit and vigor. It was Beihong's most satisfying portrait to date, and was reproduced in the National Day Pictorial of the News. Mr. Wu cherished it greatly, and wrote a recent poem in seal script, "Visiting Xie Gong Pier," to thank Beihong. He also had the portrait made into a three-color print, the size of a quarto page. Whenever friends asked for his calligraphy, he would leave a corner of the left side vacant for pasting the image. Chen Zhenru, Yang Xingfo, and Li Xiaosheng have all received such gifts, making it a unique combination of calligraphy and painting. Recently, I saw him write a seven-character quatrain and calligraphy it to present to the Minister of Interior, Niu Tisheng, along with a long postscript and a photograph. The poem reads: "(Sharing a dormitory, we responded to the imperial examination back then, our heroic spirits unmatched. Leaning on the window, the Qinhuai River remains as before, only we gaze at each other with whitened hair.)" It is said that Niu and Mr. Wu were old friends from forty years ago, having taken the autumn imperial examination together and entered the Nanjing Academy together. Recently, they came to Beijing and lived together again on the banks of the Qinhuai River. (Recompense)</p>
<h3>Further Research on the Lyrics of "Yu Tang Chun"</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, the "Free Talk" section published "Research on the Lyrics of 'Yu Tang Chun'," stating that "there is no example of 通 [tōng] (to understand) as a homophone for 臣 [chén] (subject)." In my opinion, rhyme schemes in lyrics and musical compositions naturally arise, and the three hundred poems of the Book of Songs do not adhere to pre-existing rhyme schemes to restrict later generations. Those who specialize in the language of the rulers of past dynasties but use their personal habits to judge music, will thus deem things to be "non-standard." Therefore, scholars with broad knowledge cite ancient texts as evidence, pointing out that there have been predecessors. For example, Tao Qian's drinking, or the many cases in "Forest of Grotto Immortals" are innumerable. Poetry and lyrics are like that, much less the performance of dramas! Whether they gain wide support with the masses is beyond whether or not something is right or wrong. The so-called "zhe [轍]" in Peking Opera is like speaking of something having tracks to follow. The so-called "tracks" are the traces of wheels. If there has never been a road before, then there are no tracks to follow, and not conforming to the tracks is the same as not conforming to the proper path. Mr. Ling Sheng's name is Ping [屏] (screen) in Mandarin, but is pronounced geng [庚] (seventh celestial stem) and qing [青] (blue/green) in local dialects. Mao Xihe once used the rhyme of "peng meng [烹萌]" to rhyme with "peng meng [蓬蒙]," likely using the sounds of his own local dialect to force the rhyme to achieve his goal of breaking boundaries. But in reality, "peng meng [烹萌]" can both be read as open-mouth sounds, like "bang mang [傍茫]", then why can't it rhyme with "jiang yang [江陽]"? Therefore, following Xihe's theory, nearly all sounds of rhymes can be rotated. Calling something that goes "south by driving the chariot north", which is basically to turn things back to front and make it the other way around. We can not speak of praise or criticism of it. The sound values geng qing [庚青] and zhen wen [眞文] and yuan gu [元古] all communicated in their earlier days, so if east winter [東冬] can be in harmony with geng qing [庚青], then rotating to zhen wen yuan [眞文元] naturally has examples that can be referred to. Therefore, the word "gen [根]" in the text below is not strange. However, such as "jin xin yin [金心陰]" belong to the rhyme value of qin [侵], that is, the closed-mouth rhyme value. Musical rules of the song consider that originally there was no borrowing examples for wu tou [務頭] of the past! Even though Mr. Xuan has claims for some aspects of the matter, in the end it is not publicly accepted. The flaw of the lyric in "Yu Tang Chun" is that the words "jin xin yin [金心陰]" and their cohort can not harmonize, but this isn't so for hong tong long [紅桐龍] and their cohort. Because the rhyme of qin [侵] doesn't harmonize with dong dong [東冬], so actually there isn't a trail to follow. Only when the singer is very unaware of there being trouble, so that the listener feels that the change happens very smoothly and with proper inflections. Only for hong tong long [紅桐龍] is it a nasal sound, and it isn't yin [陰] and is yang [陽], and one feels pushed and not accepted, giving listeners an unpleasant experience. That Yanqiu's changes to two rhymes for ren chen are pretty close to satisfying people's feelings, and that Shaoqing said there aren't any suitable edits to Hong Tong and only to keep this one flaw actually feels like a pity! I mean that for the words dao hong tong [到洪桐], the word dao can be shortened and used as a filler word, and by reading the two characters hong tong in sequence, what is below them, such as the one character cheng, they become well rounded on the sound and tone, what do you think about that? As for the "alliance pledge" segment, then Yanqiu's lyrics aren't as good as those of Huisheng, so later scholars should choose the better parts and discard the rest. Furthermore, such as the jade cup, it originally isn't for hitting, but changing the character hit to the character place, then it can work, and it is more proper than buy! Trays made from blue jade can be changed to flower vases. The character flower doesn't stand out, and it isn't enough to show its extravagance, so it would be better to keep it the same! And for the three hundred liang being changed to one hundred liang, the original three hundred liang is more of a figure of speech, and one hundred is the exact number and feels unnecessary. Because if forget eight procuress gets a peck of gold, but when meeting (a client), they still need three hundred, and if the matchmaker is only getting one hundred, then that is too little. I hope to pose these questions to Shaoqing to know his opinions.</p>
<h3>Shao Lou's Recording Record</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>Wang Shaolou amazed Shanghai with his debut, and now he has returned home with a reputation. Before his departure, the Greater China Record Company invited him to record five records. At that time, Shaolou was performing his farewell performances, and it seemed difficult to manage his voice for recording at the same time. However, that was not the case. Judging from the first day's recording of "Fa Men Si" (The slow Xipi tune of 塢縣 is fresher than that of Ju Peng. The entire segment is without any flaws or reservations, and is especially valuable) and the "Visiting Mother" segment (The đoạn (section) of (未開言) has not been spoken; a section of the quick ban (clapper accompaniment) from a loud shout (separations from brothers) and (有○賢弟) two sentences of shaking board are all included without omissions (Brothers) is where places lift and fall and is heroic simple and Su (Jun) Shaoqing is saying that it has been more than a decade since this inspiring phrase was heard), "Zhan Taiping" (A cannon sound like to the segment of Xipi shaking board that has baby腔 (baby sound) and 嘎調 (gā diào) and crying voice and higher and lower tones so all must be complete, and now there are few who can have this play so to see that one can hear this sound and have the vocal cords that rare). The two sections from (千歲爺) to (old man is willing to die and is unwilling to end) are a flowing board and shaking board and crying voice and following board is sweet and pleasing), and the second day's recording of the "Zhuo Fang" segment (A bright moon is a segment that Shaoqing said both has the merits of Tan Yu's speech and is full of song feeling and it belongs to a knowing speech) Bao Lian Deng segment (I should be a segment of Erhuang Yuanban (original rhythm) and this section hasn't yet been recorded and it is a red play and it is expected that it will be very popular in this trip south) Fa Chang Huan Zi (Because of Xue's home is connect to the reversal of Erhuang's three eyes and this is the true transmission of Yu (Shuyan) stream, this play is externally seen as simple but internally its difficulty is being stable and well received and this has become the most popular new style singing play), not only are the sounds as round and bright as usual, but they are also able to last, showing the hard work he put in during his throat rest. Shaolou's singing style resembles Shu Yan, praised both in the north and south. Therefore, the success of these five records is a foregone conclusion. It is also heard that the Great China's recording this time used the latest technology (the engineer just returned from an inspection in the United States last week). When the records are sold in half a month, the center circle of the record cover will also be improved, and the gloss of the records will also be enhanced. This is truly a good phenomenon in the promotion of national goods.</p>
<h3>Travels in Southeast Asia (90)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On the sixth, a friend talked about the customs of Myanmar, where men and women of the lower class are very free in marriage, with hardly any wedding ceremony. This reminded me of the verse in the Book of Songs, "You come with your carts, I will move with your gifts." Before arriving in Myanmar, some said that this place had a Yin-Yang sect that worshiped the male genitals, hanging them on the doors of houses to show the public. Upon arriving here, I asked Master Wan, who said that this place was influenced by India, but this sect had not yet reached Myanmar, but was still in India. The sect uses the male genitals as "I" and the female genitals as "Dao," combining them as "I enter Dao," which is a kind of sexual religious force that is very powerful. Every festive season, they hold large gatherings, where even elders, seniors, and distinguished scholars dress up in various guises and perform dances to offer to the goddess and seek her favor for blessings and love. He also said that Brahmanism has a special ritual, where those who study in India and live in the homes of masters know that before men and women engage in intercourse, they must have their children undress and the man respectfully bow to them before engaging in sexual activity. At first, I found it strange, but later I understood its religious meaning. I laughed and said that in today's world, the customs of overthrowing religion and etiquette have become the norm, and there is no longer any respect for elders or teachers. In the future, people will only worship money and women, and I fear that this sect will flourish in the world.</p>
<p>On the seventh, I am now studying the alms bowl entrusted by the Burmese monks. At first, I thought it was made of pottery, and if it were mixed with various dishes of food, it would become a confused mess. But upon closer inspection, it is not made of pottery but of a porcelain-like material. It is slightly similar to Fujian lacquerware with extremely intricate patterns, varying in size and very lightweight. It has a lid and contains several small foreign boxes that can hold various items, making it very suitable for household use as well. Generally, the alms begging is done by novice monks, with the whole temple's monks taking turns to do the work. It is usually held in the right hand, but some are tied with a strap and hung from the shoulder. As for the junior monks, some carry umbrellas, while others do not, and there are reasons to inquire about this. Generally, those with higher qualifications are allowed to carry umbrellas, while novice monks are not allowed to carry umbrellas, and they must endure rain and wind on their heads, walking barefoot in the water, assimilating with nature and practicing hardship. Moreover, many of the young monks are children from wealthy families sent to the temple to study and become monks, and many are nobles. Like Ananda, who went begging for alms, they should not be underestimated, for the Burmese people consider monks to be their teachers in morality and learning.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (328)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen:　Cuixiu Earnestly Asks for Words from the Teacher　Generous Discussions of Military Affairs at a Brothel Feast for Heroines</p>
<p>Ye Haoran said, "We shouldn't just listen to the opera next door. We came here to fill our stomachs, so let's not forget our purpose. First, let's order food. You guys should call for some lively music, and at the same time, write out the song list. We need to arrange the collaborations and not waste any time." Long Ziyun said, "Not wrong. We came here to fulfill the Tang Dynasty poet's lines, the so-called 'green ant newly brewed wine, small red clay stove.' And it just so happens that it's very cold tonight, so we must have Cantonese hot pot." At this time, the waiter had already placed a white notebook and a pencil from behind his ear on the table, and also brought over the menu printed by their Xinghua Restaurant. Besides this, there was also a list of what fresh dishes were available at different market prices, which was available in each room. Ye Haoran held the pencil and said, "Hot pot is a must. Let's have a two-dollar hot pot. Besides that, what other dishes do you want?" Everyone then ordered a chaotic mess of conch, pigeon pine, fragrant mushrooms, and black bean chicken. Lin Zifan then took on the task of writing the song list, as he knew exactly who to call for and who to sit next to, as if he had an account in his stomach. Before long, a red clay stove, steaming hot, was brought up, along with a large platter with ten dishes of raw meat, raw fish, raw chicken, and raw shrimp. The ten dishes were different. Besides this, there was also a large basket of spinach, as well as lard, wine, and soy sauce, everything you could want. Zuo Shichen said, "In winter, you should eat that kind of thing. I remembered the snowy scenery of cutting off bloody meat in the Dream of the Red Chamber, but unfortunately, Shanghai doesn't have that snowy scenery." Long Ziyun said, "Then you also need a group of girls like Shi Xiangyun to personally cook it to have the same feel." Lin Zifan said, "If we go to Six Three Pavilion in Hongkou to eat beef, there are Japanese women who will personally cook for us." Long Ziyun said, "The maids in Japanese restaurants, called '酌婦' in Japanese, are very elegant. Don't underestimate them. Many of them have graduated from advanced elementary school, and there are even female students from middle school." Ling Zhixiang said, "When will we go to Hongkou for a meal? Before, because we couldn't communicate with them, it felt a bit awkward. Now that we have Mr. Ye Haoran as a translator, it shouldn't be awkward." Ye Haoran said, "Okay, one day I'll treat everyone to go." Just as he was saying that, A Su came in with Yuan Jing's song. She only heard the words "treat" and said, "Young Master Ye is going to treat? Is it at Sister A Xing's place?" Long Ziyun laughed and said, "Young Master Ye said the treat is at a Japanese restaurant in Hongkou, not in a brothel. He wants to invite you to go together." A Su said, "Oh, is it at a Japanese restaurant? Then thank you. I don't care about other things, but we have to take off our shoes and walk in our socks, which is a bit too much to handle."</p>

<h3>Financial Spot Gold Discovers Reactionary Phenomenon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, December 3rd, the continuously rising spot gold suddenly turned to a low peak, and then retreated below the 600 tael mark, with only slight changes. The total amount for the city was 626 taels and 6 mace. From morning to noon, it hovered outside the 600 tael mark, but ultimately fell by more than 5 taels, which was truly a reversal after continuous gains. Although transactions among industry members were active, there were no large amounts. For example, Gu Li, Tong Taichang, Yuan Mao, and Yong bought more than they sold. Yuan Cheng, Yong Chang, and Yuan Heng all sold. Xie Yu bought and then repurchased. As for overseas silver markets, they continued to decline, especially as there were rumors from the United States of support for silver prices. As a result, large investors tended to sell, causing widespread panic. Consequently, gold prices fell sharply, and exchange rates followed suit. However, the quoted prices did not change, and then suddenly fell to 597 taels. Because exchange rates seemed stable, banks were still able to buy in. It was mostly the case that companies like Ruishun, Li Wanxing, and Xie Yu were competing to buy, leading to a rise back above the 600 tael mark. Unexpectedly, sellers continued unabated, causing it to fall back into a weak position and drop by more than 2 taels. There were not many more transactions in the afternoon because it was Wednesday, when there is a lack of foreign exchange market activity. However, the situation was hesitant, with only about 1 or 2 taels of transactions. Ultimately, it was calculated that the difference was between 99 taels. However, there was a bullish trend for large silver bars this morning.</p>
<p>The Downturn's Changes　The spot gold for January opened at 600 taels and 0.08 mace in the early morning, but immediately plummeted by 3.7 mace (the gross price initially being 600 taels and 0.05 mace, but suddenly dropping by 4 mace, with the narrowest gap being only 1 mace). This was because although large silver bars were down by 3/16, and forwards were down by 1/8, and silver prices were also down by only 1/8, the rumors from the United States of maintaining silver prices had no effect. Yuan Yong and others then aggressively sold, adding up to 1.45 mace. Zhi Tan, Feng Yongfu, Chang Tongren, Jing Xie Yu all successively sold, causing another drop of more than 3 taels. In between, there were sometimes voices of 1 or 2 mace. As for British gold, it also fell. A piece of trading from Jianyou bought a January piece at 16625, sold by Eryi. The opening price was 98.45 taels, with licenses unmoved. Dade Cheng and Tai Heng Yuan's buying sentiment was still rising, and then it fell to 97 taels. Because banks were doing inter-bank trading for this month's US dollars at $37.6875, and Sumitomo bought spot contracts at 1 mace and 2 fen and 1 li of Dalian gold, the gold price then presented a rising trend. It was estimated to be up by 1 mace, around 98 taels. Then, Tong Tai Chang, Da De Cheng, Shun Li, Xie Yu, and others stepped in to buy, so after 10:30, a good outlook was continuing, estimated to be around 99 taels. At 11 o'clock, it suddenly turned negative because foreign exchange seemed insufficient. Banks were doing inter-bank trading for this month at 16625, and forward contracts at 166875 were not easy to sell, because Yongfeng and retail investors suddenly sold, and the atmosphere became weak, falling by over 2 taels to only 98.1 mace. The afternoon close was 8.7 mace, down again by a small 2 or 3 mace. Therefore, the price of goods was pressed down by 2 mace, and the listed price was still calculated as 600 taels and 92.8 mace, a decrease of 45 mace.</p>
<p>The Weak Afternoon Market　The afternoon market opened at 98.4 mace. Upon learning that the Indian exchange rate was low at 5 anna, it immediately jumped up by 1 mace, calculated as 9.5 mace. Afterwards, there was no news of retail sales, and the Indian exchange rate increased to 2 anna, agitating the market, and it fell to around 98 taels. After 2:30, Yu Da, Zhi Feng, and Yong sold, causing it to fall by over 1 tael. At 2:10, it was at 96.9 mace. Afterwards, Yuan Mao and Yong bought, and at 3:15, it was at 8.5 mace because Tai Chang and others sold 300-400 bars, and retail investors also sold, causing it to fall by 1 tael. At 3:30, it was at 7.56 mace. Afterwards, Yuan Heng and Yong Xiang came in, but the amount was not large, but market confidence returned and was pulled up by 2 taels. After 4:00, it was at 9.5 mace. When the market closed at 4:30, it was calculated at 99 taels, a decrease of 5.5 mace compared to the previous day. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of 4-5 mace, calculated as between 8 and 8.5 mace. The price of goods was raised by 3 mace. Checking the maximum price for the day, it was 601.5 taels, and the minimum price was 596.9 mace, a difference of 4.6 taels (calculated according to the quoted prices). If calculated according to the initial gross price, there was a twist of 8 taels, with the quoted price estimated to be pressed down by 45-46 taels, and then to 45 taels. The logged prices were 602 taels for December, 199 taels for January, the water rate was 602 taels, the goods were 601 taels in the morning market, 96.5 mace at the afternoon close, and 1.5 mace and 9.3 mace at the afternoon close.</p>
<p>Small Amounts of Inflow and Outflow and Transactions Vary　It was calculated that Yuan Mao Yong, Tong Tai Chang, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Yu Da, Bing Xing, Heng Xing, Zhi Feng Yong all bought in. Xie Yu and Da De Cheng initially sold and then bought in. Tai Heng Yuan had more outflow than inflow. Yuan Cheng Yong, Chang Yuan Heng, Sun Cheng, and Yong Feng all sold short. The inflow and outflow of goods was complicated. In the afternoon, Tai Heng Yuan and Yuan Heng both bought in. Gu Li, Tong Tai Chang, Yu Da, etc., all sold. The Dalian group bought in 1,500 bars in the morning and sold 400-500 bars. In the afternoon, there were only 200 bars traded, but there were more sales. The Guangdong group bought in several hundred bars in the morning.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: Chinese Merchants Change from Buying to Selling</h3>
<p>Market Sentiment Greatly Loosens. . . The United States Also Has a Theory of Maintaining Silver Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the overseas silver market was still falling sharply, there was a theory from the United States of maintaining silver prices, fearing a reactionary trend. Exchange rates fluctuated, with Kobe remaining mediocre. HSBC's licenses and exchange rates remained unchanged. The domestic market also tended to loosen. The sudden downturn in spot gold had already broken the 600 tael mark, and the sellers ultimately fell by more than 5 taels. However, the daily fluctuation was more than 4 taels. The exchange market was also slightly unstable, and ultimately the British gold rose by 125, US dollars rose by 25, and Japanese gold fell by 375 compared to the previous night. It was a reaction after repeated tightening. Chinese merchants suddenly stopped buying and instead sold. It was calculated that British gold totaled about 200,000 pounds. Banks were still able to accommodate it. Sumitomo, Shanghai, Sanlin, Banque Franco-Chinoise, Yokohama Specie Bank, Holan, and Mai Jia Li all bought in. Various banks also did inter-bank trading for tens of thousands of pounds and tens of thousands of US dollars. Japanese gold was still sold by the Dalian group. Recently, Sumitomo, Mitsui, Taiwan, etc., bought in 600,000-700,000 yuan of Dalian bills. In the afternoon, because it was Wednesday, there was no market as usual.</p>
<p>British Exchange　The domestic market tightened and then loosened. The half-day difference was 125. The asking price for December 12 was 1 shilling and 6 pence, and the buying price was 5625.

Mitsui and Sumitomo did inter-bank trading for 10,000 pounds for January at 625. Then, Shanghai Mai Bank absorbed 10,000 pounds for January at 6875. Mai Bank also bought 5,000 pounds for March at 75. Sumitomo and Zhongfu sold 25,000 pounds to Mitsui for March at 6875. Mitsubishi, Zhijin, Banque Franco-Chinoise, and Holan bought 112,000-123,000 for January at 625. Hua Bi and Mai Bank did inter-bank trading for 10,000 for December at 625. The closing price for December was an asking price of 625 and 6875 for March, and the buying price was the asking price plus 0625.</p>
<p>US Exchange　The domestic market had a difference of 215. The asking price for December 12 was $27.9275, and the buying price for February 3 was the asking price plus 125.

Forward contracts fell by 125 to 16 pence. Chinese sellers entered the market at low prices, and market conditions stabilized. After the close, most of the United States maintained the market.

<h3>Subsidiary Coins Change Wildly</h3>
<p>Jiang Corners Suddenly Rise by 1 Fen 3 Li</p>
<p>Guang Corners Rise by 4-5 Li</p>
<p>Copper Coins Also Shrink by 3,000 Cash</p>
<p>The sudden and continuous changes in silver corners and copper coins have continued in recent days. Jiangnan small foreign coins originally had no sales, but because Guang corners have risen dramatically, people are bravely buying Jiang corners to support them. As a result, they have been raised wildly, and yesterday they were raised by a huge 1 fen and 3 li. The morning market was 6 mace, 5 fen, and 7 li, and the afternoon market was 6 mace, 6 fen, and 4 li. Transactions were made in the morning market for 3,500 corners, and in the afternoon market for 15,000 corners. According to people in the industry, the Dalian area, knowing that the subsidiary coins in Shanghai have risen sharply, has already concentrated spot goods and is trying to load them for shipment to Shanghai. It is expected that they can be loaded within a week, so market prices are expected to be slightly stable. Copper coins have also continued to shrink by 3,000 cash to 373,000 cash. Over 31,000 strings were transacted.</p>
<h3>Last Month's Interest Rate at 3.5 Taels</h3>
<p>The interest rate for November in the Gregorian calendar was announced yesterday as 3 taels, 5 mace, 9 fen, and 5 hao, while overdue interest was charged at 4.5 taels. Therefore, the highest overdue interest rate was 10 taels and 05 hao.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Continue Downtrend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot transactions in the bond market were scarce, with slightly fewer short-term bonds available. However, market buying and selling were not quiet. There were considerable transactions in bonds such as 19 Customs, Disbandment, Pension Compilation, and 19 Welfare. Due to large sellers, selling pressure was active, but the buying situation was also good. Although redemption prices continued to fall, the trend was still relatively stable. The price levels gradually declined, and no significant changes were observed. As a result, Consolidated 6%, Pension Compilation, Disbandment, 19 Customs, and 96 Bonds all fell by eight or nine cents to more than one dollar each. First Welfare then Next Month fell by one dollar. Others only fell by a few cents. It is estimated that the total spot transaction volume for the day was 18,000 yuan, with short-term transactions of over 4.4 million yuan in the morning and approximately 6.4 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling over 10.8 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Weak in the Morning, Strong in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and fluctuated in the afternoon, with the overall trend remaining weak. Actual sales were unusually sluggish. There was no demand for spot yarn from any party, so inventory was gradually increasing. Most retail investors showed considerable anxiety. The attitude of the Chaozhou merchants remained calm. Spot yarn sales in the market were stagnant. With the Lunar New Year approaching, all parties were in the process of closing accounts. There was little hope at present, so most people had a pessimistic outlook.</p>
<p>Tiao Biao (Trademarks) results were strong. The Tiao Biao market opened higher due to the rise in American cotton, and retail investors resisted short positions, causing the market to rise slightly by two or three points. Due to a lack of buyers in the market, selling pressure suddenly increased, and the market suddenly fell, resulting in a drop of 467. In the afternoon, the Tiao Biao yarn market was stimulated by news that factories were maintaining high prices, and buying interest surged again. Each month's prices increased by an average of one, two, or three qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 29,150 bales. Sellers included Chang 1,750 bales, Dachangcheng 1,000 bales, Gongtai 850 bales, Senkang 1,400 bales, and the remaining sellers at 600 to 700 bales. Buyers included 1,950 bales, Yichang 1,100 bales, Dafeng 1,600 bales, and the remaining buyers at 300, 500, 600, and 700 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Spot yarn was very quiet. Spot yarn business was unusually sluggish. According to statistics, total purchases by various merchants for the day were only 250 bales. Customer merchants included 45 bales from the mainland, 10 bales from Jiangxi, 120 bales from Shantou, 50 bales from Xuzhou, 20 bales from Xiamen, 50 bales from Weihaiwei, and 65 bales from the [unclear] merchants.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>The cotton market remained firm, with American cotton rising again. However, there were no transactions for spot cotton from various factories. In reality, the market remained flat. However, the supply of Han cotton remained scarce, and some buyers held tight, refusing to release it. If supplies from various parties could be plentiful in the future, changes would be observed at that time. Currently, the market remained in a fluctuating state.</p>
<p>Han Biao was high. The Han Biao market opened higher in the morning, following the rise in foreign cotton by one or two qian. The market closed flat, with near months rising by one qian and far months flat. In the afternoon, the yarn market rose again, and sentiment tightened, leading to stronger buying interest and some covering of short positions. Prices for each month rose by one or two qian.

<p>Grain Rice Market Reaches Peak, Large Scale Selling</p>
<p>Due to the end of the lunar calendar year, sales become increasingly sluggish.</p>
<p>Yesterday, about sixty ships from the inland arrived in Zhabei. The amount of goods transported by machines for various factories in Luli also increased significantly. As a result, the inventory in this port increased daily. Due to the upcoming closure of accounts at the end of the lunar calendar year, most people adopted a wait-and-see attitude and focused on collecting debts. Consequently, the market sales became stagnant, and prices continued to fall. High-quality Taibai Japonica rice was in short supply, with prices dropping by several cents. The price of high quality outside Thirteen yuan and eight cents. The price of Zhongguan Japonica rice gradually fell by fourteen cents. Ordinary Japonica rice only held at the Eleven yuan mark. However, the future remains uncertain. Arrivals of unhusked rice were slow, and sales were sluggish, continuing to decline by two cents. Both Yangxian and Duxian rice declined by half a cent, with the Xian rice market also trending softer. Even the retail sales in the port area were silent. High quality rice was barely holding at Eleven yuan and seven cents. Wholesale transactions were declining, and buying interest was unusually quiet. All shifts in sentiment led to further declines, dropping by four cents. High-quality wholesale rice was priced at thirteen yuan and six or seven cents, now below cost. Customer sales were not progressing, with only a few shops inquiring. The price of Yinyuan topped rice was slightly lower due to its scarcity. The price of medium quality declined slightly by three cents. The overall situation was very weak.</p>
<p>In the southern part of Shanghai, over thirty ships arrived from the lower reaches of the river yesterday. After several days of repairs, the roads have become slightly more active. Regular transactions and Suzhou used the same machinery. Due to the falling prices of goods, customers from the surrounding countryside preferred to purchase mid-to-high quality rice, but the prices declined by one or two cents. Top quality sold for Thirteen yuan and six cents, and transactions were small and sporadic. Southern merchants sold green glutinous rice and Songjiang Jia rice, but there was actually no one asking about the origins. The market gradually declined by a little more than two cents. The top market price opened at Eleven yuan and two cents. The trend for sheep tip rice was slightly weak, while Dujian still had customers buying, so the price declined by a cent. Top quality Dujian still required eleven yuan and eight or nine cents. Sales of ordinary Bianyinyuan rice were consistently slow, with prices falling by four or five cents, indicating a significantly weakened situation. Although the decline of rice prices here was more moderate compared to Zhabei, the overall trend remains downward.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Has Stabilized</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, prices for each month had stabilized because foreign price quotations recovered a good two, four, five cents. And the domestic situation is based on this kind of price as if it would be difficult to be more economical and the manufacturer's current prices and futures are completely different. The fact that spot goods are not surging smoothly is recognized by the public, but although the weakness of futures is mostly due to the environment, customer merchants' skepticism and suspicion is also the main reason for the weakness of futures. If customer merchants do not consider market prices but aim to receive goods, then at a minimum a standard situation can be maintained to a great extent. But now, customer merchants have gradually paid attention to the recent recovery, which is expected to be the reason. As a result, the current month was up by one fen and two li and a half, the first month up by one fen and two li and a half, February up by one fen and three li, March up by two li and a half, April up by five li, and May was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Futures and Spot Wheat Both Enter a Silent State</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month was generally stagnant. Because foreign price quotations rose slightly, speculative sellers naturally ceased activity. At this point, the bottom of the market was completely influenced by foreign countries. If the domestic situation were considered, it would be unexpected. However, there was still a tendency for the prices of far-term months to recover. As a result, the prices for the current month and the first month were unchanged, the second month down by a small one fen, three li, the third/fourth months down by two fen, and May was unchanged. The spot wheat market remained silent. The factories in this port did not receive any news of foreign wheat assistance. The city only sold 200 packs of Kaiwan wheat, with the price being as low as four liang and two fen. It was purchased by Wusong Hefeng.</p>
<p>The Oil Market: White Tung Oil is Flourishing</p>
<p>Jingzhou oil will arrive in mid-month... This train of oil continues to arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The foreign sales of white tung oil are gradually showing signs of activity after a period of stagnation. Shengli Yanghang and others continue to show interest in spot goods, but due to the strict price limits, daily transactions are only a few dozen tons. After the opening of the overseas sales price at sixteen liang and four qian, it has already risen to seventeen liang. Due to the difficulty in improving domestic sales, the wholesale price has been hovering around the fifteen liang mark. With customer goods arriving sporadically from the source, the asking price for Xiangtong oil has been raised by one qian to fifteen liang and three qian, showing a rather strong trend.</p>
<p>The new stock of asphalt is expected to arrive in Hancheng around the middle of this month. The stock of Macheng oil is dwindling daily. Small quantities are sold at seventeen liang and four qian. Premium quality oil still requires seventeen liang and eight qian. Although trains from the interior have continued to arrive in Shanghai in recent days, the numbers are very small, and most of them are transit goods.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Huiwen Biji is Popular with Qingdao Merchants</p>
<p>This factory's cloth. Yesterday, fine cloth was slightly better. After the price reduction, the dyeing route was quickly activated. Yanghe rose by two and a half fen, and Laba Tong Caiqiu also hardened slightly. Fine twill fell again. Blue Shuangyu fell by a small five fen. Yanghe and Jincheng fell by two and a half fen, actually because spot goods were flooding the market. The sales trend of coarse cloth and lower-quality goods was smoother. Yesterday, Ningbo, Shantou, Xiamen, and other merchants added purchases. The demand on this street was also strong, so nine-pound cloth all required four liang and two qian, which was very firm. Eleven-pound two deer and three rabbits all opened at four liang and seven qian and a half. The stock of Hubei Tianzi was still small, and racing horse cloth was more common, opening at eight liang and one qian and a half. Coarse twill from Wengtai moved slightly, but the amount was very small.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Piece Goods: Eastern goods, especially Biji, were active. Yesterday, Qingdao merchants had considerable demand for Da Huiwen, and Huxinting sold 25 pieces at two qian and five fen. Yang Guifei was also purchased. Bald blue gray required two qian and five fen and two li and a half. Fine Biji sales were also brisk. Merchants from Sichuan, Hankou, and Qingdao were actively searching for them. Ancient City Association spot goods were out of stock again. Baociu was also short of stock. Huxinting still required three qian. Sanyou bald yarn had been completely sold out. Yesterday, two qian and eight fen and two li and a half was without stock. Western goods, white cotton yarn, Yifeng recently received over ten pieces, opening at thirteen liang and five qian. Bleached cloth was increasingly active.</p>
<h3>Lower-Grade Yarn Overcoats Sell Slowly, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Women's Colored Overcoats Particularly Active</p>
<p>The sales prices of low-end yarn and overcoat fabrics priced at 1.4 to 1.5 qian have been falling in recent days. Hualun Yongfeng goods, which initially sold for 1.5 qian, fell again to 1.1 qian, 7 fen, 5 li, and even 4 li. This is because sales are slow and stagnant, and the goods purchased by various firms previously have not been sold. Zhaofeng and Madasheng yarn overcoats were reduced to 1.2 qian and 5 fen yesterday.</p>
<p>The sales momentum of women's colored overcoat fabrics has been better this year than last year, leading to a sudden surge in the price of raw materials. Sales of red, yellow, green, gray, and mixed colors have been brisk, and prices have firmed up, especially for jacquard and printed yellow-brown fabrics, which are particularly rare and popular. Women's clothing stores on this street are mostly offering high prices to buy them. Plain, unpatterned fabrics of ordinary brands are generally sold for 3 liang, 2 qian, 5 fen to 3 liang, 7 qian, and 8 fen.</p>

<h3>Opening of the Girls' Dormitory at Great China University</h3>
<p>— Zexiang</p>
<p>Opening the girls' dormitory has become a common practice at various universities in this port. Our Great China University's girls' dormitory has long been known as the "West Palace," so of course it's no exception. The opening event has been held several times. This term, the student union also sent a letter to the girls' student association asking them to choose a date for the opening in order to carry out a cleaning campaign. According to the reply from the girls' student association, the girls' dormitory will be open from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm on November 26th. At the same time, the girls' student association also posted a notice in the girls' dormitory stating that the dormitory will be open on November 26th and that the students are requested to decorate and tidy up their rooms slightly to make them clean and attractive. So the female students were busy tidying up and arranging things, and the male and female students were busy repairing their clothes. From 9:00 am to 4:00 pm on that day, the students on the campus road kept coming and going. Inside the dormitory, male and female students were chatting and laughing, and some were preparing fruits and refreshments for their best friends. This grand occasion came to an end in the evening.</p>
<h3>Record of the Opening of Qunying Residence</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The Women's Dormitory of Great China University was Opened on November 26th</p>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, the women's dormitories of various universities have been opened one after another. The women's dormitory of Great China University is naturally no exception. Speaking of the women's dormitory of Great China University, when it was first located on Jiaozhou Road, it was named "West Palace," as if it were in opposition to the "East Palace" of Fudan University. It had been opened twice. This autumn, the new campus of Great China University in Fanwangdu was completed, and a new women's dormitory was built. It faces the Xizhe River and the Liwa and Lida Villages to the west, and the Suzhou River can be seen to the south. To the east are the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and the campus of St. John's University. In this environment, the school authorities named it "Qunying Residence." Readers should not confuse this with "Junfang Residence" or "Qunfang Gathering," as that would be insulting and disrespectful to our female palace masters. Looking at the entire campus, the women's dormitory is located to the south, so it could also be called "South Palace." However, this name is not very common, so we can still use the name "West Palace."</p>
<p>The opening hours were from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM on the 26th. Those who had never entered the palace gates were generally amazed and rushed there, so the road leading to Qunying Residence was filled with male students, resembling the grand scene of "Shanyin Road." In front of the palace, there is a winding stream spanned by a wooden bridge. Some say that this bridge can be called the "Magpie Bridge," but Qixi (Double Seventh Festival) has already passed. Some say that this bridge is the boundary between male and female students and can be named the "Yin-Yang Bridge." In my opinion, for friends who are heartbroken, this bridge can also be called the "Bridge of Helplessness." After crossing the bridge, you pass through a road lined with ancient cypresses and holly trees. (The current situation) After walking only a dozen steps, you arrive at the palace gate.</p>
<p>Upon entering the palace gate, on one side is the gatehouse, and directly ahead is the reception room. Curtains hung on the side by the window, and large printed screens hung on the side by the corridor. Within this area, several rattan tables and bamboo chairs are scattered for receiving guests. Their usual reception hours stop at 9:00 PM, and most visitors come in the evening. At that time, the lights are dim and the conversation is soft, perhaps for which the printed curtains are set up.</p>
<p>On the day of the opening, the Women's Student Union assigned six hostesses to each floor. The route was up the left and down the right. On the bottom floor, to the left is the kindergarten, and to the right are the dining hall and reading room, which are not worth our attention. We still want to see the dormitories on the second and third floors. The arrangement of their dormitories, from the surface, is better than that of the male students. Each room houses two people. Upon entering, there are two wardrobes built into the wall on the west side of the door, providing them with space to store clothes. Each person also has a desk, a bed, and an orange crate. Because each person's aesthetic is different, the arrangements are also different. The rooms of students in the kindergarten teacher training class generally have many figures and drawings of arts and crafts. The rooms of female students who are good at socializing have many of their own photographs. The rooms of female students who believe in Christianity have pictures of the Virgin Mary hanging. Other rooms also have wallpaper or Western paintings. In terms of books, the female students who study hard generally have more books than others, perhaps because they were all tidied up for the opening. Each person has a steel-framed bed with wooden slats. The decorations and bedding are generally white, but there are also other colors. The orientation of the beds depends on each person's arrangement, but there are a few beds that are connected, which is probably an exception. (The women's dormitory is U-shaped, with the opening facing south. The rooms facing south are filled with sunlight, and because of the decorations, they are more beautiful and clean than the rooms facing the shade.)</p>
<p>The above is generally the common situation. The following few items are roughly the anecdotes I saw.</p>
<p>In a room on the left corner of the third floor, the room with windows on two sides is very clean. Their beds are combined into one bed, with two snow-white pillows placed on one side, embroidered with the red words "Sweet Dream." I think they must be hoping to have fantastical and sweet dreams every night.</p>
<p>On the second floor, a sunny room is decorated with pink paper window curtains. A female student from Guangdong used red bed sheets, and a framed photograph of a knot is placed on the table, probably of a newlywed, which is very noteworthy.</p>
<p>At the head of one female student's bed was placed a large foreign doll, which was very cute. I don't know if this foreign doll is a representative of her own children, used to comfort loneliness or express maternal love.</p>
<p>A certain Miss is a foreign girl at Great China University. She pays attention to her appearance and decorations. She usually perms her hair, and her eyes are dyed with ambiguous colors. She wears Western clothes and long stockings and high heels, which always attracts attention. Some say she is like a social butterfly. On the day of the opening, she wore a green cheongsam and greeted guests at the door. In her room, there are many small portraits of this lady. When we walked out of the room, we praised her a few times, and she responded with a slight smile.</p>
<p>Many female students prepared many refreshments in their rooms, probably to entertain good friends. I accepted their kindness in a certain lady's room and tasted some chocolates and bananas, etc. However, many female students gave male students the cold shoulder (especially in the afternoon), perhaps because their lovers had come to their rooms or for other unspeakable pain, and they closed the door.</p>
<p>The names of palace master and queen have been rarely mentioned since they were banned. It is said that Great China University used to have a Zhang (name not mentioned), but unfortunately she has left her alma mater with a square cap. This autumn, the patriotic female poet came to Great China University but is said to have withdrawn from her grade due to academic performance (?). For the time being there is no queen or palace master. Miss Elizabeth P., who is usually praised, is living a lonely life this autumn, and the arrangement of her room is exceptionally simple, which is very disappointing to us.</p>
<p>The opening of the women's dormitory was originally scheduled for four days, but it was later reduced to one day. However, even within this one day, there were twists and turns. As far as I know, some ladies' photos were taken away, and many ladies' perfume bottles, handkerchiefs, fountain pens, and packages were gone. Furthermore, the fruit plates and cups arranged on the tables were in a mess, and some ladies' private letters (…?) disappeared without a trace. As a result, the ladies' public anger was stirred. Originally, it was prepared not to be opened in the afternoon, but later it was guaranteed by Chairman Hua Yu and personally monitored in the dormitory, like Siamese soldiers. In reality, most of the doors were closed, and those who came later did not have much to see. The male students taking things was probably driven by curiosity and caused a funny incident. This short piece is just to let everyone know the living situation of female students and the pranks of male students, so the content is very simple, like the falling flowers and flowing water of the late spring.</p>
<h3>Great China University Faculty and Student Talk</h3>
<p>— You Pei</p>
<p>The Great China University Student Union held a discussion meeting in classroom No. 212 of the school at 7:00 PM the other day, inviting representatives of the school affairs council, representatives of the mass education committee, and all members of the various departments and colleges. Those who attended included Principal Ou Yuanhuai, Dean of Academic Affairs Lu Jizeng, Director of General Affairs Wu Haoran, Dean Sun Lei, Chairman of the Mass Education Committee Yu Zhihan, and all executive committee members of the student unions of various departments and colleges, totaling about one hundred people. Seven bells rang to announce the start of the meeting. First, Xu Zexiang, Chairman of the Student Union, gave an opening speech, briefly stating that the school's history is only six years old, and that it has achieved such rapid progress in this very short period of time. Others find it strange, but in fact, this is the inevitable result of our faculty and students working together. If there were no three hardships of those who run the school working hard, teachers teaching hard, and students studying hard, there would be no development today. Today, we can hold a meeting in this magnificent new school building, and everyone naturally feels twelve points of comfort in their hearts. The reason why the Student Union invited all of you teachers and students today is, on the one hand, for a reunion, and on the other hand, because we have had such rapid development in the past year, and we also hope to have even faster progress in the coming year. However, the people who bear this responsibility are of course the School Affairs Council and the Student Union, which are relatively important. However, I and a few other members of this Student Union have very weak abilities. In the future, how can we directly increase the interests of students and open up the development of school affairs? All of this depends on the guidance of all of you teachers and students, etc. Then, Principal Ou Yuanhuai and Dean of Academic Affairs Lu Jizeng gave speeches in succession. Next, representatives from various departments and colleges gave speeches and work reports until after 9:00 PM when the meeting adjourned.</p>
