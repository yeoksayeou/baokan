<p>日本此次總選之競選已逹到所謂白熱化之境地。吾人。從日報通訊社種種輿論上觀察。發見其兩劣點。第一自競選以後。各選舉區。屢屢發生。以暴力干涉選舉之流血惨劇。妨害他派當選。第二民政兩黨領袖。公開講演。以互揭對方之罪惡醜態爲能。而力自掩飾其弱點。此兩種現象。不獨使國民對於政黨益增加惡威。且足影響於將來之政治。在代議政治制度之下。應於選舉時。使國民得逹眞意。選出正當合法之代表。方足以顯代議之精神。若稍出以欺僞壓迫之手段。其結果即種將來政治不良之根苗。歷史上不乏先例日當局於解散議會之初。鑒於前内閣之賄案屢發。曾宜言此次選。舉務取光明公正態度冀以凈化政界。然觀今日競選情形。實未能實踐其言。固已彰彰者也。再從政黨方面言之。日本著名之政。黨除民政兩黨外。無產黨實爲後起之健者。此次競選。亦甚努力。今民政兩黨。處處暴露其劣。點即予無產黨以發展之機會競選結果。民政兩黨。無論何方腃利。已隠然另樹一勁敵。亦爲將來政治上多一糾紛之原因。更從選舉法本身言之。日本施行之普選新選法。因貴族院諸元老反對。經無數曲折。最後又修改内容一次。以遷就貴族院之意。始得通過頒布。可知貴族院實不滿於新選舉法。若今日選舉之成績不良。適予貴族院以藉口。日本在今日。貴族院之勢力尙不可侮。深恐將來貴衆之意見。愈益參差。改革貴族院之計劃。愈無希望。故吾謂此次日本之競選。關係日政局前途實非淺細也。</p>

<p>明爭暗鬭之</p>
<p>倫敦海軍會議</p>
<p>意法海軍難期均勢</p>
<p>美欲聯英牽制日本</p>
<p>日則堅持七成主張</p>
<p>路透社十三日倫敦電負責意人方面今日發表一文、謂意法海軍、絕對同等、始終爲意國海軍政策之根本原則、意代表須俟法國陳述其海軍噸數後、始可提出意國噸數、届時法意噸數、大都相同、意國主張拆毁各主力艦、俾開拆毁潛艇之途云、日代表今日發表一文、謂欲維持在遠東海上爲日本國防所必要之力量、日本贊成准某種軍艦、轉移噸數、藉以調和總噸數與分類噸數兩種極端制之方式、日本準備在一九三六年以前、不再造主力艦、並允縮减主力艦之噸量與砲口徑、及延長其年齡、日本又準備依照他國縮减之比例、縮减其輪助艦、日本側重保持八时口徑砲巡艦最小限度之力量日本知潛艇之必要、現雖提議保持其現有潛艇之噸數、但願合作以規定其用途、潛艇最大限度之噸量、應加限制、而其年齡、應定爲十三年云、法總代表泰狄歐今日發表一文、謂縮减海軍、低於戰前者、獨爲法國、現有總噸數爲六八二·○○○噸、而戰前則有一·三三九·○○○噸、戰後主力艦减五五一·○○○噸、而飛機運送艦則增三二·○○○噸、潛艇亦增六二·○○○噸、再自一九一四年起、至一九二○年止、未造新噸者、亦獨爲法國、故法國不得已仍將超過艦齡限度之主力艦與巡艦等若干噸數、留供遣用、法國願接受英美所發根據一九三○年至一九三六年造艦程序、討論一種協定之提議、法國現提議在一九三六年底法國海軍應有七二四·四七九噸、共中百分之八十二爲補换噸數、餘百分之十八爲新噸數、法國準備研究保障相互安全之方式、庶絶對的需要、可變爲相對的需要、法國準備依允暫行停主力艦一○五·○○○噸、法國着重海軍限制應與陸軍天空軍之限制、互相倚頼、法國以爲法英美間之武裝衝突、乃想像不到之事、是以法國海軍程序、乃嚴格的保衛性質、與凱洛格公約相符、法國因是對所决定的英美海軍力量之增减、無所惶駭、今以同樣互相信任之精神、希望上述僅適合其國家需要之提議、不致使他國惶駭云、</p>
<p>路透社十四日倫敦電海軍會議中人對於法總理泰狄歐之文、認爲造艦程序、而非拆艦程序、但實在數字之發表、亦可歡迎、因海軍大會此後可在實際上辦事也、法總理之數字、定使意人震愕、蓋意人如必欲與法國海軍同等、則須倍增其現有之艦隊也、日本所發表之文、有數點足與美國觀念不同、但衆信可以調和、　　路透社十四日倫敦電昨日法總理泰狄歐之宣言、其最可注意之一節、爲（法國因最近有一種新式戰艦出現不得不於一九三六年前利用其可增之七萬噸（於</p>
<p>華盛頓條約所許法國更换之戰艦三艘）之一部分、此種新式戰艦萬一有人興造、則將被迫於同一時期内利用其全部分）、此爲海會第一次述及德國Ersatz　Preuss</p>
<p>en式戰艦、即所謂（衣袋戰艦）是也、衆意法國此言、乃表明法國非得安全之保障、易言之、即（地中海之洛迦諾條約）、則對於任何縮減、不能贊同、又日本之宣言、其可注意者、爲並未説出切實之數字、但亦未堅强要求對美之七成比率、兩備忘錄衆皆視爲可啓談判之路、而有商得同意之眞正可能、至少亦可縮減主力艦之一部分云、</p>
<p>路透社十四日東京電日本官塲現尙未及研究海會法總代表泰狄歐之文、但聞已有第一感想、以爲除日本外、尙有一國要求異乎華盛頓條約所定者之噸數、即此一端、亦足堅日本所提出補助艦對英美七成比率之要求矣、現從負責方面探悉　星期三日日代表提交各國代表團之備忘錄、載有僅關於日美海軍之噸數提議、分甲乙兩項、任擇其一、備忘錄聲明英美旣已議定同等原則、故日本以爲不妨以美國海軍、爲比較日本需要之標準云、日本甲項提議如下、（大巡艦）美國十八萬噸、日本十二萬六千噸、（小巡艦）美國十四萬七千噸、日本一萬噸、（驅逐艦）美國十五萬噸、日本十萬五千噸、（潛艇）美國八萬二千噸、日本七萬八千五百噸、照此提議、日本除現有大巡艦十二艘、共十萬八千四百噸外、尙須造各重八千八百噸之大巡艦兩艘、而日本現有之潛艇力量、亦將保持、乙項提議如下（大巡艦）美國十五萬噸、日本十萬八千四百噸、（小巡艦）美國十八萬九千噸、日本十二萬噸、（驅逐艦）美國十五萬噸、日本十萬五千噸、（潛艇）美國八萬二千噸、日本七萬八千五百噸、查乙項提議所載之日本大巡艦總噸數、即日本現有大巡艦之力量也、</p>
<p>倫敦訊、美國對於倫會最近提案有兩要點、（一）爲變更華府會議所定之五五三比率新定率起見、主張廢止艘數、應爲英五美三日一·二、以兵艦噸數三萬五千噸備砲口徑十四英寸爲裁減限度、説者謂此種提案之目的、在於英美兩國海軍勢力之均等及日海軍力之低減、使在美國得以其經濟力充實海軍勢力、在太平洋佔有獨覇地位、惟英國對美態度是否放棄其海上覇權、尙屬一大疑問、而美國勢力之在國際財政經濟及外交、已代英國而佔有主角地位、理論上已承認英美均勢之英國、於實際上亦必容美國之要求、不難斷言、至於日本竭力主張七成比率、此種主張並非以防衛自國爲目的之消極主張、而實爲以掌握太平洋勢力爲目的之積極主張、所謂裁軍會議、竟將英美日三國以太平洋爲中心之暗鬭、一一暴露於世矣、</p>
<h3>日本總選决戰迫近</h3>
<p>各黨候選人數確定</p>
<p>選舉違反事件增多</p>
<p>電通十四日東京電立候補報名、於昨夜十二時截止、十四日上午十時至、據到逹内務省之報告、確定之候補總數爲八百四十二名、其派别如下、民政黨三五○、民政贊成派一○、政友會三○八、政友贊成一三、革新大國民同志一二、明政一、中立四二、社民三四、社民贊成二、日本大衆二四、勞農黨一四、全民四、地方無產二二、合計八四二名、　　電通十四日東京電總選舉期迫在數日之後、各政黨正在努力奮鬥、同時選舉運動違反事件、亦漸增加、至昨日止、違反事件已有六十八起、其中重要者爲買收之十九起、挨户訪問之九起、今後仍有相當之摘發云、</p>

<h3>滬臨時法院交涉經過</h3>
<p>（績）</p>
<p>（六）法院判决之執行從前臨時法院之判决、往往以外國觀審員不同意之故租界捕房不予執行以致判决效力等於具文、本協定草案第六條第二項規定法院之一切判决及裁决、一經確定、即應執行、（協定草案第六條第三項）</p>
<p>（七）女監民事拘留所之收歸我管、及監犯之移送中國監獄狱執行民事拘留所及女監向由外國書記官長管理法院無從過問至其他監獄舊協定雖有視察委員團之條迄未實行此次規定民事拘留所及女監、完全由我國管理至濧於租界内之監獄管理權我方出席委員據理力爭但外人以監獄管理涉及租界行政不願於此次法院問題内牽入解决經我方再四監持、始允將所有一切已决人犯、及將來判决人犯無論中外國籍均得由法院决定、送交租界外中國監獄執行、至現有租界内監獄、僅拘禁違警罪犯、及羈押候審人犯但關於監獄之管理、須儘其可行之程度遵守中國監獄法令我國司法當局随時有派員視察之權（協定草案第七條）</p>

<p>（九）外國律師之限制從前凡有領事列席之案件均許畔外國律師代表任何方面出庭、又工部局爲告發人之案件及凡有領判權國人訴無領判權國人案件、均許外國律師代表任何方面出庭並無遵守我國律師章程之義務、本協定草案規定外國律師僅得代表外國人及工部局、且以外國人爲一造及工部局爲民事原告刑事告訴人及捕房起訴案件爲限、較以前範圍縮小甚多、且本協定草案、規定外國律師須向我國司法行政部請領律師證書並服從關於律師一切法令、並應受我國之懲戒（協定草案第八條）</p>
<p>以上犖犖大端、對於舊協定有損我國法權各缺點、雖已排除而新協定草案所未能完全稱意者、在檢察官之職權與司法警察之推薦兩點（協定草案第五條及第六條第四項）惟現時自訴範圍正擬擴張故檢察官之職權雖與現時情形稍有出入、而於將來制度或無大異至司法警察問題、雙方爭論異常激烈外人方面以租界行政關係、堅持不肯讓步最後始允由高等法院分院院長於工部局推薦後任命之、但有將其免職之權且須服中國法警制服、及服從法院之命令及指揮、並於换文中第三欵、規定工部局儘其可行之程度、應推薦中國人爲司法警察員警此項規定較臨時協定略勝一籌、但因租界行政關係未能完全滿意自宜歸人收回租界案内一併解决又新協定草案中所稱新添之點、一爲關於協定爭執之調解、由雙方政府各派常川代表二名、共同設法解决（協定草案第九條）一篇與租界利益有關係案件及其爲訴訟之參加人、工部局得延請律師代表出庭、以書面向法庭陳述意見（協定草案第八條第二項）但第一點雙方常川代表之之意見除雙方政府同意外毫無拘束力此種調解辦法、在他國亦有先例此次常川代表之制略師其意蓋將雙方意見不同之點先行就地設法解决至不能解决時、始適用外交手續解决之、至第二點工部局請律師一節因從前外國官員旣有觀審之規定又一切、案件須經過外國書記官長之手是實際上凡有案件莫不有外人之參與此次觀審會審曁外國書記官長制度概行取消外國姿員方面以租界利益有關之案必欲許工部局延請律師代表出庭俾有陳述意見之機會但其陳述意見、限於書面、法院對其書面意見完全有自由採捨之權、至民事參加以遵守吾國民事訴訟法爲限、本爲我國法律所許者也、换文中司法警員對於訴訟文件錄由之職務（换文第三欵）亦爲外國委員所最堅持、此欵與現時臨時法院外國書記官長登記之職務、大不相同蓋從前外國書記官長於登記訴訟文件之外不特有分配案件之權、且一切訴訟事項、自遞呈交保查案以至執行等事、均由其主持而司法警員之職務、則錄載事由而已至訴訟文件之送逹及執行、新協定草案第六條固已明白規定由警員立即爲之則警員自不得任意拖延積壓也</p>
<p>又此次中外委員之會商、其權限僅爲討公共租界中之審判機關、故對於法租界會審公廨之收回問題、尙須俟新協定簽訂後再行交涉、新協定中對於法租界之管鎋問题所以暫未解决者、職是之故、又所謂洋涇浜章程及附則、察其内容、實屬一種地方警察單行章程、新協定中旣戰明在吾國政府自行制定公布以前、暫仍沿用、則其效力固屬過渡性質也、（協定案第二條第一項末節）</p>
<p>新協定草案内容、大致如上所述、其未能守全逹到我國願望之點、则以上海租界尙未收回、行政權操之於人、形格勢禁、有不能不兼顧事實之處、此次外人方面、本有依據舊協定繼續三年之趨向、我方堅持不動、新協定方能成立、其有效期間定爲三年、期滿非經雙方同意不得延長、則本協定雖未能盡如人意、而三年之期、爲畔尙短、在此期間内、上海租界問題當有相當之解决、是今茲未能滿意之點、將來必歸於自然解决矣、王寵惠王正廷報告、</p>

<h3>魯省黄河岌岌可危</h3>
<p>濟南通信、連日天氣漸暖、黄河冰解、已至凌汛時期、據河務局報告、黄河已由上游解凍、（上游氣候較暖、下游近海較寒、）至下游北岸、六段利津縣境之綦家嘴、冰隨水下、水勢繼長增高、截至今日（十日）止、已漲至六尺有餘、形勢岌岌、河務局昨已嚴電各工段員司、不分晝夜、竭力防堵、修造子埝、編製凌排、以防大水順流而下、撞壤掃壩、又恐僅憑各工段員兵、搶護不及、已電沿河各縣縣長、令調集民夫、協同防堵、以免意外、據河工人謂本年黄河開凍太早、水漲過猛、但如天氣不再變冷、河冰不至再結、或可無虞、蓋最可怕者、上游冰解、冰水混合、順流而下、而下游冰結、水無去路、水如山立衝壤堤壩、其勢極猛、堵禦較伏汛尤難、十七年廢曆正月、下游棘子劉王家院决口十八年廢曆正月、下游扈家灘决口、均在凌汛期間、而扈家灘至今尙未堵合、前清慣例、凌汛决口、河工人員、不受處分、即因冰隨水下、堵口者不敢下水之故、而今年適逢河務局長易人、舊局長趙會鵬已</p>

<h3>金潮中之濟南商業</h3>
<p>濟南通信、自金貴銀賤風潮發生、上海因係世界之市場、所受影響最大、濟南雖係一省都會、除金店能受上海金貴影響外、與世界風潮、尙無直接關係、但以接近青島海口之故、日本貨物、源源由膠濟鐵路運入濟南、日貨固以金本位計算者、金價旣高、貨價不漲自漲、市面自不能不受其連帶之影響、茲調查金潮中各業情形如次、</p>
<p>金店金價在濟南平時每兩兑銀幣四十餘元、去年底漲至五十九元、月餘以來、又增至六十八元、金店買進、祇在六十四元左右、據情形觀察、似已漸看平靜、濟市金店、去年凡存金貨者、均獲利不少、内中以瑞生祥阜豐爲最、慶雲金店受恒大銀號倒閉影響、雖有利益、仍屬得不償失、</p>
<p>洋布日本布疋行銷山東甚旺、年來灘縣布疋雖進展不少、但仍望塵莫及、以現在行市較、日本布比平時每件漲二十元、（每件四十疋）每疋約漲五角左右、蓋金貴影響也、且青島膠海關改徵金單位以後、平均每疋本布約加二角、濰縣布則無之、昨日行市、日本白細布藍龍牌、每疋十一元、花鳥布每疋十元五角、因日本布漲價之關係、濰縣布遂行銷暢旺、濟市已現供不應求之象、但價値亦漸提高、金貴影響、正提倡國貨之好機會也、　　棉紗濟市之棉紗市塲、日本紗約佔十分之七、去年平時每件二百三十五元者、今年則二百四十八元、平均日紗約漲十元之譜、魯豐公司之紅羊藍羊棉紗、雖比較無甚漲價、但仍不能與日紗抗衡、最近一星期來、本省之東昌屬、及河北大名屬、本省南部之濟寗滕縣等處、均來濟購買、每日成交五六百件左右、昨日之日紗行市、與去年較約漲十數元、其價目如下、（現貨）十六支金貨二四六、十六支銀月二四三五、十六支寳來二四零五、十六支五星二四零五、十六支銀中二三七、二十支宫女二六六、二十支人中二五一、二十支寳來二五八五、十六支吉羊二四零五、十二支吉羊二三二、</p>
<p>沙糖　日本沙煻、（每包二百二十磅合一百二十五斤）去年十六元至十七元、本年受金貴影響、每包漲爲十八元、市上海斤前售一角二分者、今售一角四分、</p>
<p>紙張　日本新聞紙、現時每連售五元四角、較金價平時漲四角、每件十五連約漲六元左右、印刷紙以磅重計、每磅較前漲三分有奇、</p>
<p>麵粉　濟南麵粉廠計有七家、自去年以還、銷塲日蹙、營業不振、其最大原因、蓋由濟南沿鐵路綫以南、則泰安徐州各有麵粉公司、由濟南沿鐵路綫以北、曩時可以盛銷平津、今則衹可到德州、由濟南沿鐵路綫以東、接近海口、自青島以迄沿海岸烟台等處、胥爲外國麵粉銷塲地、濟南麵粉、輕易不能東去、有時外國麵粉且可伸張勢力於濟南、如前年日本之寳石金魚太陽等各雜牌麵粉、運濟銷售者、約十萬袋、職是之故、濟南麵粉、除銷當地外、衹可運至小清河沿岸以至武定屬各縣、銷塲窄狹營業不振、自金價暴漲後、日本麵粉已不能再來、故青島一隅、紛紛來電、向濟南各麵粉廠訂購大批現貨、其銷烟台海州等處、亦均由青出口、據昨日調查、濟南麵粉廠、除成豐外、如惠豐華慶德豐豐年民安、均賣出七八車五六車不等、致各麵粉廠供不應求、存貨掃數一空、</p>
<p>天津方面麵粉廠、與濟南有同等影響、數日來津商在濟收買小麥甚多、當此廢曆年頭、商界休息、南路小麥來源極少之際、經此鉅量收買、麥價乃因之大漲、在十日前小麥每百斤六元六七角、本月六日濟南糧業公所第一日交易、每百斤漲一角、翌日又漲一角、昨日（九日）復突漲二角餘、每百斤小麥、已値七元一二角麵粉廠方面亦循例增價、每袋五分、今日又漲一角矣、（二月十日）</p>

<p>少年丨老太太。你的年紀太大了。臉袋子又難看。恕不相讓。　　母（向放學回來的兒子説）一孩子。你今天午後在學堂中可安靜麽。子丨怎麽不安靜。我從午後第一課起。直睡到第三課。一些兒聲響都没有。冰屍  徐小庭　　冰爲至堅之物。其堅之程度如何。全視氣候温寒爲轉移。天氣愈寒。則冰結愈堅。十九年一月中。江北天氣驟寒。河水凝結交通斷絶者。互一月之久。當此冰河聲中。跑冰失足者。日有所聞。其最慘厲者。厥爲冰屍一事。因紀之。以供愛讀本刋諸君之談助。　　昭陽廣源洋貨肆。有賬客某甲。（甲在邵伯。井與人合股開店。）一月上旬。奉店東命。向各鄉收賬。甲因順道至家。携其妾。及其幼子。預備至邵（伯）度春節。當一月六日。河水已漸冰。甲命舟子鑿冰而行。趧道前進。蓋遲則恐阻塞於途次。詎知甲舟行至某河。忽起颶風。上流冰塊。鏘然而至。忽將該船擊翻。全船連舟子搭客溺斃十餘人之多。颶風一夜。河中結冰盈尺。玻璃版上。舟隻無踪。此一幕慘劇。竟無一人知之。　　時至一月杪。河中冰結如故。各鄉農民。因見河開無日。遂鑿冰入城購物。竟發現此事。家屬聞訊。急僱人將甲屍。及其妾與子撈起。舁至昭陽北禪堂廟中收</p>
<p>殮。當時予曾到塲參觀。見甲屍冰結如鐵。妾懷中仍抱其子。冰塊凝結。牢不可破。母子竟連成一體。令人不慘忍睹。殮時。家屬用熱水洗濯。浴至十餘次。屍體始軟化。甲之携其眷屬至邵也。本預備度快樂之春節。途次。竟罹此鉅禍。此誠冰河聲中一幕意外之慘劇也。紐約將用機械人充警士  國新　　紐約爲美國商務中心點。車水馬龍。自早至暮。塡街塞巷。雖指揮車務之警士。滿佈通衢。然迄不敷用。且車務章程。煩瑣異常。專藉記憶力之作用。舛錯可慮。市政當道。現思得一奇策。所有指揮車馬之責。擬概以機械人任之。此項機械人除擔任傳票及讓責驅車人之外。餘凡警士能行之職務。概能一一任之。諸如指定車去向。限制汽車之速率在車馬紛馳之要路。並能一一指揮。使之有序不亂。至按時開關紅綠信號燈。更能酌量緩急。較生人有過無不及。其餘各種指揮車馬之信號。亦能一一兼顧。萬無一失。其機關之奥妙。洵爲巧奪天工。但道破之。則亦平淡無奇。蓋預在各通衢之要會。按橡皮片若干處。其橡皮之下。置以層層之簧板。然後將簧片與此項機械。以電線貫之。故車馬馳過路面之橡皮片上。其輕重緩急。一一影響橡皮片之下簧板復由電力逹於機械人。機械人因能按其震蕩之輕重。而啓閉其指揮車馬之信號焉。有屋無門  公　　此爲一絶趣之事。而亦爲絶慘之現象。興化去年災况。不亞於西北各省。爲數十年來所未有。人民無可果腹。採樹皮草根爲食料。苟延生命。其後則樹皮草根亦罄。餓死者纍纍。而國内慈善家。曾未嘗措意及之。於是一般壯丁。紛紛赴滬。並有盡室以行者。蓋爲就食計也。有數村人家。幾於一口不留。履其境。如入空山。并鷄犬之聲亦杳。所有房舍。盡成空屋。屋中已無長物。固不虞賊盜。然笨重傢具。終不能盡携而去。則皆將門户堵塞。以土磗塡砌之。内外不通。俟歸來時。再行拆卸。仍可居住。而在就食時期中。即無須留人看守。免生顧慮。故今日之興化鄉間。無門之屋。到處可見。四面均爲墻壁。不知者不將疑爲巨大之明槨耶。（按。營槨於地面。以置棺柩者。吾人稱爲明槨。爲暗槨之對。）惟以上海之現狀度之。工業不振。廠家以虧蝕不能維持。而致倒閉。或輟其一部之工作。如南洋烟公司之暫停滬廠者。時有所聞。是原有勞工。已屬供過於求。岌岌焉不可終日。此蜚災民。來滬就食。當亦爲作工耳。竊恐雖有力氣。亦無工可作。則嗷嗷待哺者。勢將仍困於待哺之中。進退維谷而已。噫。退卒語  絜廬　　某甲。杭人。初爲某肆夥友。以事與同事某乙口角。怒甚。取儿上瓷阵孟捽某乙。乙被創仆地。甲疑已斃。倉皇而遁。輾轉爲孫傅芳某軍部下。及孫軍潰敗。某甲與同伍二人軍需官某丙。避匿龍游某山間。同伍二人見軍需某丙携有紙幣二萬金。乃與甲謀。殺丙共分其財。已縛丙於柳樹。將下毒手矣。甲天良忽動。亟以果報之説規二人。謂寃魂不滅。謀財害命。難逃報應。不如瓜分其財。赦其一死之爲得也。二人然其言。丙遂得活。後甲爲國民革命軍某軍營長。屢建戰功。一日。自軍營外出。見野外風景幽美。青山白云。古樹斜陽。不覺留戀竚立。出望遠鏡閒眺風物。忽見一顆黑物。自遠飛來。急伏地以避。則一彈已嗤然堕地。去身僅咫尺數十人。以古　爲掩護。與敵軍鑒戰。敵軍以爲軍士之列於掩護物後者。必非下級兵士。爰以古塜爲的。架巨礮相轟擊。時甲忽心動。不待上官發令。急令同隊兵士。退後如干米。列陣與敵軍對壘。及礮彈落地。石飛樹折。古塜爲之粉裂。。而甲隊得免於禍。由是甲益信因果之説。深以内戰爲非。遂棄軍士生涯。而爲學校之僕役焉。絜廬　讀李華弔古戰塲文。杜甫等之非戰詩等。未嘗不嘅嘆戰爭之慘。歐戰旣作。歐美小説家多作非戰</p>
<p>之小説。以警　武之野心家。其用心亦良苦矣。近人某君作短篇小説。紀一兵士救一寡婦。後敵人之彈適中其衣内一銅圓之面。得不死。其事雖滑稽可喜。然獲報之理。與某甲同。智婢  嵆絸　　太湖地瀕江浙。汪洋萬頃。汶港紛歧。尤爲盜匪出没之區。頃據友人言。湖濱施家村朱某。家素封。苦盜爲患。第以祖業所在。未便遷徙。而貴重之物。均已寄存城市親串處。空室之中。祇主婢數人。以事炊食而已。上月二十夜。忽聞有</p>
<p>人撾門甚急。婢出應之。知爲盜。相戒勿啓。主人大懼。同婦瑟縮室隅。不知所措。時盜已踰垣而入。明火執械。勢甚洶洶。婢則若無其事。随取煤油半桶。見後園中有積薪焉。灌而縱火焚之。風大火猛。烟熸濁天。村人麕至。旋聞婢登高而大呼曰（主家有盜。是縱火以來援也。請從此入。）時人義中有李某者。素驍勇。習少林術。手擔水杖一支。與盜遇。且鬥且舞。風鳴</p>
<p>鈎響。四五人仆地。餘盜披靡奔。墻不得上。羅拜乞命。某擲杖於地。笑而語之曰。（鼠輩如此伎倆。亦習作盜。庸足治乎。）啓門縱之去。主人感謝。請以婢妻之。且曰（此婢年幼。膽智過人。他日必能作家。雖竈下養奚害）。而李某亦允爲擇吉成禮。一時傳爲美談。張飛之頭  蘭因　　蜀漢時代之將相多膾炙人口。歷萬世而不衰。諸葛關張。其最著也。至今四川各地。猶有不少遺跡。爲人所稱道。而巴縣之張飛頭。尤爲可異。近據川人告我。巴縣有桓侯廟。建築雄偉。奉桓侯祀。巴人信仰異常。而桓侯亦屢著靈蹟。此則似他書亦嘗載及。不足爲奇。惟廟中</p>
<p>尙保存其首級。法以巨缸貯油。浸首其中。每隔數年。逢一香汎。遠近男婦之赴廟燒香者。輒逾萬人以上。住持僧即於是日啓蓋。加油若干斤。自蜀漢以來。保存至今。皆用此法。平時不輕啓缸蓋。故欲觀其首級者。必俟至香汎加油時。而其頭並不壤。奕奕如生。告我者曾親見之。謂初與常人無異。但兩眼甚大。睜視不閉云。考張飛本傳。涿君人。字益德。（俗訛爲翼德）少與關羽俱事先主。雄壯威猛。嘗以二十騎立當陽長板坡拒追者。敵不敢近。程煜等稱之爲萬人敵。自經演義煊染。舞臺扮演。愈覺生氣勃勃。千載以下。猶可想見其爲人。而敬之慕之。不圖其首級尙留於人間。與其聲名同垂不朽也。按關廟遍天下。蜀中則武侯桓侯趙雲之廟。亦到處可見。遺愛在人。雖死有如不死。今之偉人。何皆衹顧目前。而不於身後稍加之意耶。噫可慨已。　　關廟遍天下。本報亦遍天下。巴縣人閲此。其能以張飛頭攝影寄來。製版刋布。公諸世人乎。吾意自由談記者。亦必表歡迎也。蘭因又記。文虎徵射  吳蓮洲襪線鉛刀憑衆力輕車羽扇宛前賢○○俗語句二將信將疑若即若離才子佳人最難捉摸○○七唐一句酩然直到太平時○○四子二句嬌妻常伴拙夫眠○○六才一句螢　　　　　　○○崑戲名一貂裘换酒　　　○○古人名一一月三十日夜夜妻獨宿○○詩經一句雨意還雲意　　○○京戲名一半月夫妻不到頭○○影戲名一勞燕分飛　　　○○詞牌名一膺射者限三日内郵投本報館西隔壁吳蓮洲醫室射中備有薄酬（明日續刋孫玉聲佳作）心上温韾（一二八）  包天笑　　第八回　瓊筵開處嬌鳥啼花　金屋妝成良禽擇木</p>

<p>因爲他們眼中之三保太監無異是一位萬能的天使、有什麽事情、一懇求到這天使、便會給他們不少的便利、　　一天的清晨、在郊　野的荒僻處三保太監在那裏大便、　　（馬來人眞是懶得不成樣了、像這樣的民族生存着、也不過是將來被淘汰的廢物吧了、像吃飯吧、也懶得去動一動手、我想這樣的民族、應當有一種可以充飢的果品、那是最好不過的了、）他一壁蹲着大便、一壁這樣想、　　因爲三保太監眼見着馬來民族、連種田這樣重要的工作都不懂、恐怕他們將來要逹到絶食的境地、所以他很想給他們有這樣的一個良好的完善的辦法、　　當二天的清晨又來了、三保太盜仍舊跑到昨天大便的地方去大便、可是這回却把他驚嚇着了、原來在他大便的地方、那些糞已經變成了一顆有刺的果實的樹了、　　當日的那顆樹、便是現在熱帶裏特有的珍品榴蓮樹了、虎與鱷　　三保太監自到了馬來的海島地方總是存心收服他們、但是、愚蠢的馬來人、又那裏敵得過機警善謀的三保太監呢、因之馬來人便把三保太監目爲非凡的大師、什麽事情、都聽憑三保太監的吩咐了、　　三保太監之來南洋、本來是想把馬來民族完全滅亡的、他一到南洋之後、眼看着這些可憐的愚蠢的馬來民族、也就無須用什麽誅滅的方法了、因此他從中國帶到南方的害人的東西丨虎、鱷、也只好由牠們逍遙在這樂土了、　　於是在這樂土裏、便從此有了這兩種害人的動物了、　　虎和鱷、原是居住在中國的、然而、給三保太監帶到南方來、對於起居上、不免要感到不便了、於是牠倆天天向着三保太監閙着要回中國去、　　三保太監對於這兩種害人的動物、本早已想爲漢人除、才帶牠們到南方來的、　　一日、虎和鱷又在三保太監跟前吵閙着回中國去、　　（好吧、你如果要回到中國去、須用（木扣）丨釜丨當作船、蚊帳當帆張、才能好好地回去、）三保太監對鱷這樣説了之後、鱷走開了、　　不久、三保太監去吩咐虎和鱷説、　　（蠢笨的東西、假如你們好好地在這裏過生活、那麽你們以後便把馬狗和鬍鬚臭狗作充飢的食料吧、）　　（太爺、假如這些東西不夠充飢、又怎麽辦呢、）虎和鱷異口同聲地説、　　（如果不夠的話、那麽連羊也給你們食吧、）　　於是牠們從此以後、便逗留在南方了、　　爲了牠們把馬狗誤聽爲馬交人（馬交原是澳門、但在南洋叫廣州人曰馬交人、）鬍鬚臭狗誤聽作潮州人、羊誤聽作唐、因此居留在南方的中國人、如潮州人和廣州人等、便受害不淺了、（三）茅屋　　讀者諸君、假如你們有機會到南方海島去觀光、那末你便可以看到海灘近處、或村落中的一椽一椽的茅屋了、這些茅屋、我想最使你們覺得奇怪的、便是茅屋離地而築吧、你要知道麽、這其中便有這樣的傅説了、　　當三保太監在南洋的時候、那時候的馬來民族還是野蠻的懶惰性很濃厚的生番、他們除了掠殺之外、對於日常的衣食住是毫不關心的、因此他們所處的地方、就無異上古時代的人一般穴居野巢了、　　三保太監南來時、是帶了不少兵民同來的、所以他們處在這山番的境地、便不得不自行建搭屋子來居住、爲了三保太監的航帆、擱在海邊的原故、他們便在海濱附近、搭蓋茅屋居住了、　　一日、酋長遇見了三保太監、他想刦掠三保太監的貨品了、然而機警的三保太監早已料到他的來意、因之生番們便給他説服了、以後非但不刦掠他、反而情願保護他、以免别族的生番刦掠、　　於是馬來族的生番、和三保太監（禮尙往來）了、　　太爺、我眞奇怪你怎麽能夠在水上建築房子的、）酋長好奇地問三保太監　　（那是没有什麽難、而且是容易的事、）　　（不難嗎、）　　（是的、不難、）　　（那末、你爲什麽要把屋子做成有脚的呢、）　　是的、因爲恐怕潮水淹没了海灘、如果這樣做了、那潮水便不致於把房子冲去了、）　　（這些子可以在山林中建築麽、）　　這時三保太監是存心把他們完全滅亡了的、於是他便告訴酋長説、　　（可以的、你們以後不妨照着我們的房子做、）　　（好吧、山林裏有惡獸和狂風、不會把屋子弄塌麽、　　（放心吧絶對不會的、）　　下接第三版</p>

<p>其股若白石之樹、</p>
<p>置於金精之座</p>
<p>舊約歌中之歌、</p>
<p>近來居家無事、讀谷崎潤一郎集、這一位作家、負有日本的王爾德的盛名、是耽溺於官能享樂的頽加蕩Decadanl主義者、他是唯美派中描寫肉感與變態性的能手、谷崎潤一郎的作品、差不多篇篇可以令讀者感覺到澹厚的肉的氣息、他的長篇小説（痴人之愛）、不用説得確是一部描寫近代都市的男女丨慘綠少年與不良少女丨的典型傑作、即把他的短短篇創作而言、我們也不能不承認作者是一位女性肉體美的善頌善歌者、尤其是（富美子的脚）一篇、令人讀了不禁油然發生對於女性的脚渴慕祟拜的心情、且先看作者自己的供狀、</p>
<p>（我是從孩子時代看到了年輕女子的美好的脚形就會發生一種異样的快慰的人、）</p>
<p>（看見好女子的脚、立刻會發生不能自禁的憧憬、而要對牠像祟拜神一般祟拜的那種来可思議的心理作用、從小時候已經潛伏在我的胸奥、一直到了最近、我方纔從一本書上知道有這種瘋狂心理的人、並不限於我一個、在世界上渴仰祟拜異性的脚的拜物敎徒、可以稱做Foot</p>
<p>Ferchist的人們、在我以外還有無數、）</p>
<p>日本女性的脚、大約是世界上一件罕有的美術品、這些美術品、只有在日本、肯公開展覧可以給大衆鑑賞、莊谷崎潤一郎鋭敏的眼中、富美子那雙裸足的曲線美、眞是有異常魅惑的力量、他這样描寫脚的顔色、　　（那雙脚假使説是白呢、其實在一面又不是白、脚踵的周圍以及爪端淡淡的滲着薔薇的顔色、而形成了一種淡紅的鑲邊、我看到這種顔色、令我想起了夏天喫的那種加了牛乳的覆盆子、白的牛乳和覆盆子的果汁溶化成一片的顔色）</p>
<p>（皮膚顔色、帶着一年中不斷地按摩着的一般的潤澤和光輝、好像象牙一般的潔白柔滑、不、實在説起來、即使是象牙也不會有這種神秘的顔色的、在象牙的裏面、如其能夠使年輕女子的暖温的血脈流通、那麽或者能夠造成幾分和神聖與優美混合而成的奇妙的顔色相似的光景）、</p>
<p>至於脚的形態、更描寫得極是纎細周詳、如脛呀·趾·踝骨·趾甲、總之把脚的一切肉的部份、都細膩地描摹出來、</p>
<p>（像用白木細心地雕成的纎纎脚脛、愈到下面、愈加細小、在踝骨的地方、一旦緩緩地收縮之後、再緩緩地作成傾斜而成爲柔軟的脚趾、牠的傾斜的終點、五個足趾從小趾起依次的漸漸伸長一直到拇指尖踹整列着、趾甲却是非常的圓拱、五只足趾、好像英文的M字、一般的互相整然地緊合着、她的足趾的整齊合式、正像是用米粉塑成了脚的形狀、然後用剪刀一刀一刀地剪出來的一樣、生在脚趾尖端的那些可愛的趾甲、像排列着的基石、但是實際上比基石更爲鮮艷、而且比基石更爲纎小、巧於細工的匠人將眞珠貝薄地切了、一片片地用心研磨、然後用小釘</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>子釘在米粉細工的上面、那時或者可以得到富美一般的美麗、富美子的足趾是天生成戴着一個個的寶石的、假使將她的趾甲一個個的切下來做成一串、一定是很漂亮的一串女王的頸圏）、</p>
<p>谷崎潤一郎不但在（富美子的脚）一篇中這樣謳歌脚的美麗、他在（刺青）一篇短篇小説裏面、描寫一個姑娘的雪白的裸足、更來得動人、</p>
<p>（那雙女人的脚、在他看去是可貴的肉中寶玉、從姆趾到小趾的那纎細五趾的排列法、不比在繪島海邊拾來的淡紅的具壳的顔色輸一籌的爪甲的色澤、像珠玉一般的踵的圓潤、要疑心清列的岩泉不住在脚下洗流一般的潤澤、這脚、正是這脚、便就要受男人鮮血的塔養、踐踏男人的身體的、）</p>
<p>他不但能够欣賞女性脚的顔色的嬌艶與形態的美麗、而且竟會把脚當作一個人的容貌一樣去看、他的視覺與神經、比衆不同特别地鋭敏、他可以分别出脚有同面子孔一樣種種複雜的表情哩、譬如、　　（她的左脚受了要倒向旁邊去的上半身的影響、用力地往下伸着、將全身的重量、祇支在接觸地面的姆趾上、脚尖和趾甲、着實地踏在泥上、因此、足趾全體的皮膚都非常地緊張、同時還有一種怕慌一般的膽小的表情、這正像受了驚慌而將要飛去的鳥兒一般地收緊了翼翅和涨緊</p>
<p>了呼吸的那一刹那的感覺、）　　脚會做出膽小怕慌的表情、這算不得什麽希罕事、讀者們還可以從谷崎潤一郎那枝筆端、看到脚在（笑）的姿態哩（小趾和無名趾被握住在空中、所以剩下來的三趾散開着正像脚底裏被搔着一般地做出一種奇妙和嬌態、）是的、脚底板被搔的時候、甲和趾往往呈出言種表情、因爲是被搔着的時候的表情、所以説他在（笑着）是一點不錯的、</p>
<p>我們都得承認、一般的日本作家都犯着一種共通的弊病、就是對於描寫往往不　瑣屑詳密、所以免不了令讀者發生織續細碎不快的感覺、但是、谷崎潤一郎却反在這一點上得到例外的成功、我們初看到（富美子的脚）這一個題目、可以决定誰也料不到作者會在一雙女人的脚上、這樣地買盡力量來描寫的、等到我們跟了作者的筆、像螞蟻匍匐爬行般從脚脛起作鑑賞的出發點一直到趾甲尖端的時候、我們反要感覺到作者那枝筆端似手跳躍得太速快了、我們恫不得在富美子那一雙脚上再多（流連忘返）一下、那故事的開端與收束、倒反而變成不重要的題材了、我想讀過谷崎潤一郎的（富美子的脚）諸君、十人中至少有九人曾發生這樣的感想吧、那麽、不是有意要與諸君開玩笑、</p>

All three treaties are based entirely on the principle of equality and emphasize the following three points: (1) both parties have tariff autonomy; (2) people residing in each other's countries are subject to the laws, regulations, and all rules of their respective host countries; (3) the right to navigate inland rivers is enjoyed by nationals of the respective countries. In the future, whether large or small countries enter into treaties with China, these three treaties will serve as blueprints. This matter is extremely important for the future of our diplomacy. Currently, the Czech side has sent the signed original of the Sino-Czech Treaty to the Czech capital. Once the country receives it, a date will be set for official publication. It is expected that it can be officially announced in Nanjing and the Czech Republic simultaneously in three weeks.</p>
<p>(2) The agreement to reorganize the Shanghai International Settlement Provisional Court is scheduled to be formally signed in Nanjing next Monday. Once signed, a date for publication will be set. As for the representatives for the signing, the Chinese side has decided to appoint Xu Mo as its representative. The foreign side will be represented by an attending member designated by each minister.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the return of Weihaiwei, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and British Minister Lampson have signed a draft agreement. Minister Lampson has sent the draft to London. Once it arrives, a date will be set for formal signing. If there are no unforeseen events, this matter can serve as a preliminary step toward the return of leased territories. As for the Liugong Island issue within Weihaiwei, a flexible approach has been taken. It can only be used for summer retreats, similar to Yantai and Qingdao. The specific details cannot be announced at this time.</p>
<p>(4) The Sino-Turkish Treaty has been drafted by Minister Wu and the Turkish Minister in Washington. The treaty has now been sent. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will formally sign it after government approval.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the Sino-French Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Convention, the French Minister has not yet responded to the Ministry, and there is no definite date for signing. France's intentional delay in this matter is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>(6) The Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty is currently in progress, but progress is very slow, which is also regrettable. As for the Sino-Japanese tariff issue, it is part of the commercial treaty and will be incorporated into the treaty after it is determined in the future.</p>
<p>(7) The new Norwegian Minister will arrive in Shanghai on the 21st of this month. After arriving in Shanghai, a date will be set to come to Nanjing to present his credentials. The expected date is around the 24th or 25th of this month.</p>
<p>(8) The Crown Prince of Denmark is scheduled to visit China this month. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has consulted with the National Government's Bureau of Ceremonies on reception arrangements. (9) Since the abolition of commissioners of foreign affairs in various places, the Ministry is concerned that municipal and county governments may be unclear on how to handle matters involving foreigners. It has been decided to send inspectors from the Ministry to various regions to liaise with them at any time, so as to avoid obstacles in handling foreign affairs. Currently assigned are: Pan Lianru for Hebei, Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Rehe; Cui Tujie for Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi; Li Fang for Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Anhui, and Jiangxi; and Tao Lüqian for Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong.</p>
<p>Finally, when reporters inquired about the Sino-Russian negotiations, Wang replied that since the declaration was issued, the Soviet Russian side has not yet responded as of today. Mo Dehui has agreed to serve as the plenipotentiary representative for the formal Sino-Soviet conference. Whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs needs to send personnel to accompany Mo to Moscow to handle everything will depend on Mo's own opinion. (15th)</p>
<h3>The Weihaiwei Recovery Case</h3>
<p>Liugong Island Issue Resolved</p>
<p>Lampson Arrived in Hankou Yesterday</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the negotiations for the recovery of Weihaiwei, Lampson and Foreign Minister Wang signed a draft agreement in Beijing on the 13th. Lampson immediately sent the draft to London, pending approval from the British government. Then, representatives from both sides will determine the date for formal signing. It is reported that the most important point of contention in this negotiation was Liugong Island. Our side has approved the use of the island by British and Japanese navies for summer retreats. The draft agreement now signed is more complete than the articles previously negotiated between Liang Ruhao and the British representative, and does not allow Liugong Island to be leased to Britain as a naval base in the Far East. Lampson took a plane to Hankou at 9:00 AM on the 14th and is scheduled to return to Beijing on the original plane on the morning of the 15th. (14th Dispatch)</p>

Except for luxury goods, most fall within the scope of reciprocity. The reciprocal products proposed by our side only include more than 20 categories, so further consultation is needed.

<h3>Chiang Embraces Determination to Complete Revolution</h3>
<p>丨丨Issues Statement After Receiving Yan's Telegram丨丨</p>
<p>Now Is Not the Time for Lofty Retreat</p>
<p>Must Continue to Take Responsibility for Party and Nation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Our reporter heard that Yan Xishan sent a telegram to Chiang, advocating for yielding to the country and agreeing to retire together. The reporter paid a special visit to Chairman Chiang to inquire about everything. Chairman Chiang issued the following statement: We revolutionaries, placing ourselves in the revolution, aim to save the nation from crisis and relieve the people from suffering. It is the duty of revolutionaries to seek happiness for others, not to pursue personal gain. Therefore, revolution is our duty, our responsibility, not our right. Rights can be sacrificed, but duties cannot be abandoned, and responsibilities cannot be evaded. The so-called yielding can only be spoken of in terms of rights, not in terms of duties and responsibilities. Our revolution is not for personal rights, so there is no need to talk about yielding, and there is no such thing as contention. In our struggle for revolution, we only know not to speculate, not to be opportunistic, not to seek ease, and not to fear difficulties and preserve ourselves. Therefore, we only know how to fulfill revolutionary duties and exhaust revolutionary responsibilities. Yielding is indeed a virtue, but it cannot be used as a pretext to lose the revolutionary status of the important task of the Party and the nation, and it certainly cannot be called yielding but actually rewarding chaos. Since the beginning of the Republic of China until today in the 19th year, the country has been plagued by disasters and the people have suffered miserably. The reason why the revolution cannot be completed is that the serious illness lies in shirking responsibility and preserving oneself, with no one taking responsibility. Otherwise, the Chinese National Revolution would have long been completed, so what remains for us to take responsibility for and sacrifice for? Since I followed the Premier and dedicated myself to the revolution, I have been apprehensive every day and every moment, fearing that my duties and responsibilities have not been fully exhausted and that I have failed in my revolutionary duty. Therefore, every day and every moment, I have exhausted my efforts to fulfill my due obligations and perform my responsible duties. Since the completion of the Northern Expedition, I have been deeply grateful that national unity will be successful and national independence will soon be realized, and our revolutionary duties and responsibilities will also be completed in one out of ten thousand. Therefore, I advocated the implementation of reorganization and disbandment to seek unity, intending to retire after the completion of the reorganization and disbandment, so as to be able to unload the burden and rest temporarily. Unfortunately, since the rebellion of the Gui Clique warlords last spring, reactionary warlords have rebelled one after another, causing the foundation of the Party and the nation to be in danger and the people of the whole country to be in a state of misery and exhaustion. The great revolutionary cause will also be ruined. To speak of retiring at this time would be advantageous for me personally to unload the heavy burden of hardships, but what about the survival of the Party and the nation? What about the future of the revolution? Therefore, in the midst of great difficulties, regardless of success or failure, I am determined to dedicate myself to the Party and the nation to eliminate traitors in order to fulfill my revolutionary duties and responsibilities. Fortunately, with the spirit of the Premier and the efforts of the soldiers, the rebellious warlords have been gradually pacified, and the fate of the cause has been preserved. However, at a time when the reactionary forces have not yet been eliminated and the foundation of the Party and the nation has not yet been consolidated, our revolutionary duties and responsibilities cannot be evaded in the slightest. Moreover, since we have been entrusted with the important task of the Party and the nation, our employment, advancement, and retreat cannot but be based on the orders of the Party and the nation. We must never change resolutions or violate laws and regulations based on the private opinions of one or two people. Zhongzheng is determined to revolutionize. His head can be cut off and his bones can be broken, but he will never dare to violate the spirit of Party rule or step out of the scope of revolution to follow the tide, be afraid of the head and the tail, and worry about gains and losses, so as to stain the blemish of his revolutionary history. Therefore, I believe that the present is the day for us to strive and fight, and certainly not the time for lofty retreat. In the future, I will continue to take responsibility for the Party and the nation in the spirit of revolution. Personal rights and status are certainly not in my mind, and even my personal life and death have long been put aside. All I know is to fulfill my responsibilities and duties. Right and wrong will be judged by the world and future generations. No slander and no power can shake my determination to revolt. (14th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Disadvantages of the Japanese Election</h3>
<p>The Japanese general election has reached a so-called white-hot state. We, observing from various opinions in Japanese newspapers and news agencies, find two disadvantages. First, since the election, in each electoral district, there have been repeated bloody tragedies of using violence to interfere with the election and obstruct the election of other factions. Second, leaders of both the Minseitō and Seiyukai parties have made public speeches, revealing each other's crimes and scandals, while trying to conceal their weaknesses. These two phenomena not only increase the people's resentment towards political parties but also affect the future of politics. Under the system of representative politics, it is important to allow the people to express their true intentions during elections and to elect legitimate representatives in order to demonstrate the spirit of representation. If any means of deception or oppression are used, the result will be the seeds of future political problems. History is full of precedents. At the beginning of the dissolution of the Diet, the Japanese authorities, in view of the frequent bribery cases of the previous cabinet, declared that this election should take a bright and fair attitude in order to purify the political world. However, judging from today's election situation, they have failed to practice what they preached. This is already obvious. Furthermore, from the perspective of political parties, in addition to the Minseitō and Seiyukai parties, the Proletarian Party is indeed a rising star in Japan. This election is also working very hard. Now that the Minseitō and Seiyukai parties are exposing their weaknesses everywhere, they are giving the Proletarian Party an opportunity to develop. Regardless of which party wins the election, a strong enemy has been established, which will cause more disputes in the future. Furthermore, from the election law itself, the new election law implemented in Japan, due to the opposition of the veterans of the House of Peers, underwent numerous twists and turns. Finally, the content was revised again to accommodate the wishes of the House of Peers before it was passed and promulgated. It can be seen that the House of Peers is actually dissatisfied with the new election law. If the results of today's election are not good, it will give the House of Peers an excuse. In today's Japan, the power of the House of Peers cannot be underestimated. I am deeply afraid that in the future, the opinions of the nobility will become more and more divergent, and the plan to reform the House of Peers will become more and more hopeless. Therefore, I say that the Japanese election is related to the future of the Japanese political situation and is not a superficial matter.</p>

<p>International Telegrams</p>
<p>Open and Covert Struggles in the</p>
<p>London Naval Conference</p>
<p>Italo-French Naval Parity Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>America Wants to Join England to Check Japan</p>
<p>Japan Insists on Seventy Percent Claim</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 13th- An official Italian source published a statement today saying that absolute equality between the Italian and French navies is and always will be the fundamental principle of Italian naval policy. The Italian representatives must wait until France states her naval tonnage before they can put forward Italy's tonnage. At that time the French and Italian tonnage will be mostly the same. Italy proposes to dismantle all battleships so as to open the way to dismantling submarines.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 13th- The Japanese representatives issued a statement today saying that Japan supports that some kind of warship tonnage be transferred in order to bring into line the two extremes of aggregate tonnage and classified tonnage. Japan is willing to not build battleships before 1936, and will decrease the tonnage and bore of the battleships, and increase their age. Japan is ready to cut down its assistant warship tonnage by the same proportion as other countries' cuts. Japan emphasizes maintaining the minimum necessary power of 8-inch bore cruisers. Japan knows the necessity of submarines, and even though it proposes to maintain its current submarine tonnage, it is willing to cooperate to prescribe their use. The maximum allowable submarine tonnage should be limited and the age should be fixed at 13 years.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 13th- The leader of the French delegation, Tardieu, issued a statement today saying that France is the only country that has cut down its navy tonnage below pre-war levels. The current aggregate tonnage is 682,000 tons, while the pre-war tonnage was 1,339,000 tons. Post-war battleships have been cut down by 551,000 tons, and aircraft carriers increased by 32,000 tons, and submarines also increased by 62,000 tons. Also, France is the only country that did not build any new tonnage from 1914 to 1920. Therefore France has no choice but to leave in service a certain tonnage of battleships and cruisers that exceed the age limits for a time. France is willing to accept the proposals by England and America for discussing an agreement based on the warship building program of 1930 to 1936. France proposes that the French navy have 724,479 tons at the end of 1936, of which 82% is replacement tonnage and the other 18% is new tonnage. France is prepared to study ways of ensuring mutual security, so that absolute requirements can become relative requirements. France is prepared to permit a temporary halt to the construction of battleships of 105,000 tons. France emphasizes that naval limitations should be mutually dependent with limitations of land and air forces. France thinks that armed conflict between France, England, and America is unimaginable, so the French naval program is of a strictly defensive nature and accords with the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Because of this, France is not alarmed at the increases or decreases of British and American naval power that have been decided. Now, with the same spirit of mutual trust, it hopes that the proposals above that are suitable only for its national needs will not alarm other countries.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 14th- People at the Naval Conference think that Prime Minister Tardieu's statement has more to do with a warship building program than a dismantling program, but the publication of concrete figures can be welcomed, as the naval conference can then do business practically. The Prime Minister's figures are certain to shock the Italians, as the Italians would have to more than double their existing fleet if they wished to have equality with the French navy. The statement by Japan has some points that are different from American ideas, but most believe that they can be brought into line.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 14th- One of the most notable points in Prime Minister Tardieu's declaration yesterday was (Since France has recently seen the appearance of a new type of warship, it will have to use part of the 70,000 tons that it is allowed to increase before 1936 (of the three warships that France is allowed to replace under the Washington Treaty), and if someone builds this new type of warship, it will be forced to use all of its tonnage in the same period). This is the first time that the naval conference has mentioned the German Ersatz Preussen-class warships, also known as "pocket battleships". Most believe that this statement by France shows that France cannot agree to any reductions unless it is given security guarantees, in other words, a "Locarno Treaty for the Mediterranean". Also, what is notable about the statement by Japan is that it did not state concrete figures, but also did not strongly demand a 70% ratio with America. Everyone considers the two memorandums to be able to open the path to negotiations, and there is a genuine possibility of reaching agreement, or at least reducing part of the battleships.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Tokyo, 14th- Japanese officials have not yet had time to study the statement by the leader of the French delegation, Tardieu, but they have heard that their first impression is that, besides Japan, there is another country that is demanding tonnage that is different from that set out by the Washington Treaty, and this fact alone is enough to strengthen Japan's demand for a 70% ratio of auxiliary warships to England and America. It has now been learned from responsible sources that the memorandum that the Japanese representatives submitted to the delegation of each country on Wednesday contains proposals concerning only the tonnage of the Japanese and American navies. They are divided into paragraphs A and B, and one can be chosen. The memorandum states that, since England and America have already discussed the principle of equality, Japan thinks that it may as well use the American navy as the standard for comparing the needs of Japan. Japan's paragraph A proposals are as follows: (large cruisers) America 180,000 tons, Japan 126,000 tons, (small cruisers) America 147,000 tons, Japan 10,000 tons, (destroyers) America 150,000 tons, Japan 105,000 tons, (submarines) America 82,000 tons, Japan 78,500 tons. According to this proposal, Japan would, apart from its existing twelve large cruisers of 108,400 tons, still have to build two large cruisers of 8,800 tons each, and Japan's existing submarine power would also be maintained. Paragraph B proposals are as follows: (large cruisers) America 150,000 tons, Japan 108,400 tons, (small cruisers) America 189,000 tons, Japan 120,000 tons, (destroyers) America 150,000 tons, Japan 105,000 tons, (submarines) America 82,000 tons, Japan 78,500 tons. It is learned that the aggregate tonnage of the large cruisers stated in paragraph B is the same as Japan's existing large cruiser power.</p>
<p>London report, America has two key points regarding the most recent proposals in London, (1) that, in order to change the 5:5:3 ratio set by the Washington Conference, the number of ships that should be scrapped should be five for England, five for America and 1.2 for Japan, with a limit on warships of 35,000 tons and 14-inch bore cannons. Some say that the purpose of this proposal is to equalize the naval power of England and America and decrease the naval power of Japan, so that America can use its economic power to fill out its naval power and monopolize the Pacific. However, it is still a big question whether England's attitude to America is to give up its maritime hegemony. With the international finance, economics and diplomacy of America already replacing England and occupying the leading role, it is not difficult to declare that England, which has theoretically accepted Anglo-American parity, will in fact have to allow the demands of America. As for Japan doing its utmost to advocate a 70% ratio, that advocacy is not a passive advocacy for the purpose of defending its own country, but an active advocacy for the purpose of controlling the Pacific. So-called disarmament conferences have thoroughly exposed the covert struggles of England, America, and Japan, with the Pacific as the center, to the world.</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>Negotiations Regarding the Shanghai Provisional Court</h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>(6) Enforcement of Court Judgments: Previously, the judgments of the Provisional Court were often not enforced by the Settlement Concession police force due to disagreement from foreign assessors, rendering the judgments ineffective. Article 6, Section 2 of this draft agreement stipulates that all judgments and rulings of the court, once finalized, shall be executed. (Draft Agreement, Article 6, Section 3)</p>
<p>(7) Transfer of the Women's Prison and Civil Detention Center to Our Jurisdiction, and Transfer of Prisoners to Chinese Prisons: The Civil Detention Center and Women's Prison were previously managed by foreign clerks, and the court had no way to intervene. Although the old agreement had provisions for inspection committees for other prisons, they were never implemented. This new agreement stipulates that the Civil Detention Center and Women's Prison shall be entirely managed by China. Regarding the management rights of prisons within the Settlement Concession, our representatives argued strongly, but the foreign representatives, citing that prison management involves Settlement Concession administration, were unwilling to include it in the current court issue for resolution. After repeated insistence from our side, they finally agreed that all convicted criminals, and those sentenced in the future, regardless of Chinese or foreign nationality, may be transferred by court order to Chinese prisons outside the Settlement Concession for execution of sentence. As for the existing prisons within the Settlement Concession, they will only detain offenders of police regulations and those held for trial. However, regarding the management of prisons, it must comply with Chinese prison laws to the greatest extent possible. Our judicial authorities have the right to send personnel to inspect at any time. (Draft Agreement, Article 7)</p>
<p>(8) Establishment of a Lost and Found Depository: Previously, confiscated stolen goods from the Provisional Court's judgments were handled by the police. This new draft agreement stipulates that the court should establish a Lost and Found Depository in accordance with Chinese law, and all confiscated items shall be the property of the Chinese government. However, regarding the disposal of firearms, as it is related to the Settlement Concession's security, the foreign representatives insisted that the Municipal Council be permitted to construct judicial authorities, and whether or not to accommodate them is entirely at our discretion. (Exchange of Notes, Article 7)</p>
<p>(9) Restrictions on Foreign Lawyers: Previously, foreign lawyers were allowed to appear in court on behalf of any party in all cases where a consul was present. Furthermore, in cases where the Municipal Council was the complainant, and in all cases where citizens of a nation with consular jurisdiction sued citizens of a nation without consular jurisdiction, foreign lawyers were allowed to appear on behalf of any party without having to comply with our lawyer regulations. This draft agreement stipulates that foreign lawyers may only represent foreigners and the Municipal Council, and only when a foreigner is one party or the Municipal Council is the plaintiff in civil cases, the complainant in criminal cases, or in cases initiated by the police, which is a much narrower scope than before. Moreover, this draft agreement stipulates that foreign lawyers must apply for a lawyer's license from our Ministry of Judicial Administration, obey all laws and regulations regarding lawyers, and be subject to our disciplinary actions. (Draft Agreement, Article 8)</p>
<p>The above are the major points. Although the shortcomings of the old agreement that harmed our legal rights have been eliminated, the points in the new draft agreement that are not entirely satisfactory are the powers of the prosecutor and the recommendation of judicial police (Draft Agreement, Article 5 and Article 6, Section 4). However, the scope of private prosecution is currently being expanded, so the powers of the prosecutor, although slightly different from the current situation, may not be significantly different in the future system. As for the issue of judicial police, the dispute between the two sides was extremely intense. The foreign side, citing the administrative relations of the Settlement Concession, insisted on not conceding. Finally, they agreed that the president of the High Court branch would appoint them after the Municipal Council's recommendation, but has the power to dismiss them, and they must wear Chinese judicial police uniforms and obey the orders and directions of the court. Furthermore, Article 3 of the Exchange of Notes stipulates that the Municipal Council should recommend Chinese people as judicial police officers and constables to the greatest extent possible. This provision is slightly better than the provisional agreement, but is not entirely satisfactory due to the administrative relations of the Settlement Concession and should be resolved together in the case of the recovery of the Settlement Concession. Also, the new points mentioned in the new draft agreement include: firstly, the mediation of disputes regarding the agreement, with each government sending two permanent representatives to jointly find solutions (Draft Agreement, Article 9); and, secondly, in cases related to the interests of the Settlement Concession and in which it is a participant in the litigation, the Municipal Council may engage lawyers to appear in court and submit written opinions to the court (Draft Agreement, Article 8, Section 2). However, the opinions of the first point, the permanent representatives of both sides, are not binding unless both governments agree. This kind of mediation method has precedents in other countries. The establishment of permanent representatives this time is roughly intended to find ways to resolve differing opinions on the spot first, and then apply diplomatic procedures to resolve them when they cannot be resolved. As for the second point, the Municipal Council hiring lawyers, since foreign officials previously had the provision of assessors, and all cases had to go through the hands of the foreign clerk, in practice, almost all cases involved foreigners. This time, the system of assessors and foreign clerks has been completely abolished. The foreign side, concerned about cases related to the interests of the Settlement Concession, insisted on allowing the Municipal Council to engage lawyers to appear in court in order to have the opportunity to present their views. However, their presentation of views is limited to written form, and the court has complete freedom to adopt or reject their written opinions. As for civil participation, it is limited to complying with our civil procedure law, which is already permitted by our law. In the Exchange of Notes, the duties of judicial police officers regarding litigation documents and records (Exchange of Notes, Article 3) were also most insisted upon by the foreign representatives. This clause is very different from the current duties of the foreign clerk of the Provisional Court to register. Previously, the foreign clerk not only had the power to register litigation documents, but also presided over all litigation matters, from submission of documents, bail, investigation to execution. The duties of judicial police officers, however, are limited to recording the facts. As for the service and execution of litigation documents, Article 6 of the new draft agreement has clearly stipulated that it should be done immediately by the police, so the police should not arbitrarily delay or backlog.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authority of the current consultation between Chinese and foreign representatives is limited to the trial institutions in the International Settlement Concession, so the issue of recovering the Consular Tribunal of the French Concession will have to await further negotiations after the new agreement is signed. The reason why the jurisdictional issue of the French Concession was not resolved temporarily in the new agreement is because of this. Also, the so-called Yangjingbang Regulations and its appendices, upon examining their contents, are actually a kind of local police regulations. Since the new agreement has clearly stated that they will continue to be used temporarily until our government formulates and promulgates its own, then its effect is certainly transitional. (Agreement Article 2, Section 1, last clause)</p>
<p>The contents of the new draft agreement are roughly as described above. The points that fail to fully achieve our country's wishes are that the Shanghai Settlement Concession has not yet been recovered, the administrative power is in the hands of others, the situation is restricted, and there are places where we cannot but take into account the facts. This time, the foreign side originally had a tendency to continue for three years based on the old agreement, but our side insisted on not budging, and only then was the new agreement able to be established. Its period of validity is set at three years, and it cannot be extended without the consent of both parties. So, although this agreement is not entirely satisfactory, the period of three years is still short. During this period, the Shanghai Settlement Concession issue should have a considerable resolution, and the points that are not satisfactory this time will inevitably be naturally resolved in the future.

<h3>The Central Propaganda Department Receptions the Press</h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department hosted the press at 2 PM on the 13th in the Central Second Conference Room. More than 30 reporters stationed in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and other places attended the reception. Minister Ye Chu Cang presided over the meeting and reported that after Tang Shengzhi's rebellion failed, all domestic rebellious forces have been suppressed. Only a small portion of Zhang Guiyu's remnant force in Guangxi remains, hiding in the dense forests of the mountains and awaiting pacification. According to recent reports, it will be concluded soon. We feel that these recent military changes were indeed led by a few rebellious military officers, but they were merely tools of frustrated politicians and bureaucrats. These military officers were instigated by politicians and made irreparable mistakes. As a result, the tools were overthrown, but the reactionary elements who used the tools, the so-called politicians and bureaucrats, etc., still exist. As long as they exist, they will find ways to make trouble. Although the military changes have passed, the movement of politicians and bureaucrats has not stopped, and they are still lurking in various places, using various methods to sabotage the overall situation. They are creating many inaccurate arguments everywhere to incite the people. Therefore, after the end of the military campaign, we should work harder in theory to prevent all reactionary activities. For example, the sayings "Party affairs should be resolved by Party members, and national affairs should be resolved by the people" seem smooth at first glance, but after investigation, these two sentences can lead China to permanent chaos and even destruction. Those who say this may be happy for a moment, but they do not know the great impact. Please pay special attention to such fallacies by the press. It is clearly contrary to the teachings of the Premier, because it separates the Party and the country into two parts, which is intended to sabotage political tutelage and make it impossible for the Party and government to be realized. Political tutelage is the link between the Party and the country, with the Party training the people during the period of political tutelage, and then returning political power to the people to realize constitutional government. This is the only way to truly enable the people to resolve national affairs. If we follow what they say, political tutelage will not be able to proceed, and constitutional government will not be able to be realized. What is this if not a violation of the teachings of the Premier? From another perspective, it is natural for the country to be resolved by the people. The Kuomintang does not deny this, but our Party wants to hand over political power to the people when they are trained to be able to resolve national affairs. Therefore, the period of political tutelage is necessary, because the people are not yet organized, and the local system is not yet complete. It is very dangerous for an unorganized people to resolve national affairs. Our Party has political tutelage in order to enable the people to resolve national affairs. If the Party does not provide political tutelage and the tutelage is interrupted, then in a period when the people have not yet fully received political power, it will definitely be seized by a part of the people, be it military, politicians, or a mixture of military and politicians. From this, we can see that the impact of this good-sounding phrase can allow military and politicians to impersonate the people and seize political power to resolve national affairs. The reason why there has been no peaceful unification in the past eighteen years is because national affairs have been resolved by military and politicians every day, and military and politicians have been divided again and again, so national affairs can never be resolved. We must consider whether we want military and politicians to resolve national affairs now. If not, then this kind of word with great danger should be corrected. It is also natural for Party affairs to be resolved by Party members, but we must know in what way. The people have a certain method, that is, the National Congress elects a Central Executive Committee to resolve Party affairs. In an orderly system, there is a certain way. The Central Standing Committee meeting every week resolves national Party affairs, and the Standing Committee meeting of a province resolves the Party affairs of all counties in the province. The Party has a constitution, all organizational laws, and all resolutions. If Party affairs are not resolved by the Central Committee entrusted by the National Congress, but by those who have been expelled from the Party and bureaucrats and politicians, not only will Party affairs not be resolved, but I am afraid that all Party disputes will begin from here. Party affairs should be resolved by the Central Executive Committee, which is neat, unified, and empowered by the National Congress. Those without a Party history, or those with a Party history that is not conducive to the Party, are not enough to resolve Party affairs. Now, everything needs peaceful unification, and there must be an unyielding and strong Central Committee to have any possibility of peaceful unification. To have a strong Central Committee, we must use all our strength to maintain the Party headquarters and the government, and not allow the slightest disorder in the system. If the system is disrupted, there will never be peace. There are many kinds of inaccurate arguments, this is one kind. This kind of argument is contrary to the teachings of the Premier, violates the hopes of the people, and sabotages the peace and unification of the Party and the country. Now that the military campaign is about to end, there are still reactionary elements of remnant politicians who are trying to find various ways to spread inaccurate reactionary remarks, so I am telling you what I thought of today as a reference for you to preside over public opinion. The report ended and the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency)</p>

Gu said that this time he led the military staff to Xuzhou and would be stationed in Xuzhou temporarily. Commander-in-Chief Liu is expected to arrive within a week. The Second Division of the headquarters is still staying in Bengbu and has not yet received orders to depart. It is not yet certain whether they will go north in the future. Commander Gu entered the city that evening, and the headquarters of the First Army was located in the old Daoyin (Circuit Intendant) Office. The staff members of the military headquarters all came to Xuzhou with him, including Chen Mianwu, the chief of staff, Huang Zuo, the chief adjutant, and Zhu Tang, the counselor. Zhao Qilu, the chief of staff, has not yet arrived. The headquarters of the Second Division remained in Bengbu, and Zou Wenhua, the chief of staff of the division, presided over everything.

The 2nd Division is in Bengbu, Zhang Lisheng's cavalry 2nd Division is in Southern Suzhou, and Chen Yaohan's newly compiled 26th Division is in Huaiyuan, also under Gu's command.</p>
<p>Ren Yingqi's 49th Division was ordered to transfer to northern Anhui and has now departed from Haizhou. Ren sent Xu Guanghua, the director of the transportation department, to Xuzhou yesterday to contact everything with the Jinpu and Longhai Railways. Xu said that Ren's division had an An Rongchang brigade transferred to western Henan last year to participate in the campaign against Tang, and has now returned to Woyang and Mengcheng in northern Anhui.

They will all be transported by rail to the Yunhe station, get off the train and walk through Suining, Lingbi, and Guzhen to Chou County, Fengtai, Zhengyang and other places. There are post roads and military stations along the way. As for the baggage and other items, they will be transported by the Longhai Railway to the Jinpu Railway. There are only two trains of trucks, which need to be loaded and transported back and forth. Xu came to Xuzhou to contact this matter. It was found that Zhao Qingshan's brigade, the first batch of Ren's division to depart, has arrived in Henan and is heading south, and the rest will also depart one after another. The defense area left in Haishu has been taken over by Xu Shengyu's independent 13th Brigade. (12th)</p>
<h3>The Yellow River in Shandong Province is Perilously Close to Breaking</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The weather has gradually warmed up in recent days, and the Yellow River ice has thawed, reaching the period of ice flood. According to the report of the River Affairs Bureau, the Yellow River has thawed from the upper reaches (the climate in the upper reaches is warmer, and the lower reaches near the sea are colder). In the lower reaches, on the north bank, at Qijiazui in Lijin County, the ice is going down with the water, and the water level continues to rise. As of today (10th), it has risen to more than six feet, and the situation is precarious. The River Affairs Bureau sent a strict telegram to the staff of each work section yesterday, ordering them to do their best to prevent and control the situation day and night, build sub-dams, and weave ice rafts to prevent the flood from flowing down and sweeping away the dams. They were also concerned that relying solely on the staff and soldiers of each work section would be insufficient to protect the area, so they telegraphed the county magistrates of the counties along the river, ordering them to mobilize the people to assist in the prevention and control, so as to avoid accidents. According to the river workers, the Yellow River has thawed too early this year, and the water has risen too sharply, but if the weather does not turn cold again and the river ice does not freeze again, there may be no danger. The most terrible thing is when the ice in the upper reaches thaws, and the ice and water mix and flow downstream, while the ice in the lower reaches freezes, and the water has no way to go. If the water is like a mountain standing and eroding the dikes, its power is extremely fierce, and it is more difficult to block and defend against than during the flood season. In the first month of the 17th year of the old lunar calendar, the breach at Jizi Liu Wangjia Yuan in the lower reaches and in the first month of the 18th year of the old lunar calendar, the breach at Hujiatan in the lower reaches, both occurred during the ice flood period, and Hujiatan has not yet been blocked. According to the previous Qing Dynasty practice, river workers who failed to prevent breaches during the ice flood season were not punished, because the ice went down with the water, and those blocking the breach did not dare to go into the water. This year happens to be the change of director of the River Affairs Bureau. The old director, Zhao Huipeng, has</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>left office, and the new director, Liu Pengyi, has not yet arrived in Jinan. The Bureau affairs are currently being handled by Zhao Luren, the chief of the General Affairs Section. Due to the importance of the ice flood, the bureau has repeatedly telegraphed Liu to come to Jinan to take office. The telegram of the River Affairs Bureau is recorded as follows: (Immediately send to all sections, upper and lower, for review. The weather has been mild for several days, and according to reports, the river ice in each section is gradually melting and the water level is rising. The dams and ice rafts along the river are inevitably crowded and damaged. Please supervise the flood soldiers and patrol and protect them day and night, and do not be negligent in the slightest. Also, report in detail whether the dams have been damaged after the ice has thawed, and whether there have been any changes in the shape of the Hujiatang mouth, so that we can examine them. Director Zhao Huipeng, sealed) (10th)</p>
<h3>Jinan Commerce in the Golden Tide</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap occurred, Shanghai, as the world's market, has been most affected. Although Jinan is a provincial capital, it has no direct relationship with the world's trends, except that gold shops can be affected by the expensive gold in Shanghai. However, because it is close to Qingdao Seaport, Japanese goods are continuously transported into Jinan by the Jiaoji (Jiaozhou-Jinan) Railway. Japanese goods are calculated on the gold standard, and as the price of gold rises, the price of goods will naturally rise, and the market cannot but be affected by its linked effects. The following is an investigation of the situation of various industries in the golden tide:</p>
<p>Gold Shops: The price of gold in Jinan was usually more than 40 silver dollars per tael. At the end of last year, it rose to 59 yuan, and in more than a month, it increased to 68 yuan. Gold shops buy in at around 64 yuan. According to the situation observation, it seems to be gradually calming down. Gold shops in Jinan, those who had gold goods in stock last year, all made a lot of profit. Among them, Ruizhengsheng and Fufeng were the most profitable. Qingyun Gold Shop was affected by the collapse of Hengda Bank, although it had some profit, it was still not worth the loss.</p>
<p>Foreign Cloth: Japanese cloth is very popular in Shandong. In recent years, although Tanxian cloth has made a lot of progress, it is still far behind. Compared with the current market price, Japanese cloth is 20 yuan more expensive per piece than usual (40 pieces per piece), and each piece is about 5 jiao more expensive, due to the impact of expensive gold. After Qingdao Jiaohai Customs changed to collecting gold units, an average of about 2 jiao was added to each piece of native cloth, while Weixian cloth did not have this. Yesterday's market price was 11 yuan per piece for Japanese white muslin brand and 10.5 yuan per piece for flower and bird cloth. Due to the increase in the price of Japanese cloth, Weixian cloth is selling well and there is already a shortage in Jinan. However, the value is also gradually increasing. The impact of expensive gold is a good opportunity to promote domestic goods. Cotton Yarn: The cotton yarn market in Jinan is about 70% Japanese yarn. Last year, the usual price was 235 yuan per piece, but this year it is 248 yuan. On average, Japanese yarn is about 10 yuan more expensive. Although the Red Goat and Blue Goat cotton yarn of Lufeng Company are not much more expensive in comparison, they still cannot compete with Japanese yarn. In the past week, Dongchang and Daming in Hebei Province, and Jining and Tengxian in the southern part of the province have all come to Jinan to purchase, with a daily transaction volume of about 500 to 600 pieces. Yesterday's market price of Japanese yarn was about ten yuan higher than last year. The prices are as follows: (Spot) 16 count Gold Cargo 246, 16 count Silver Moon 2435, 16 count Baolai 2405, 16 count Five Star 2405, 16 count Silver Middle 237, 20 count Palace Maid 266, 20 count Figure Middle 251, 20 count Baolai 2585, 16 count Jiyang 2405, 12 count Jiyang 232.</p>
<p>Sugar: Japanese sugar (220 pounds per bag, equivalent to 125 jin) was 16 yuan to 17 yuan last year. This year, due to the impact of expensive gold, each bag has risen to 18 yuan. The market price in Shanghai was 1 jiao and 2 fen per jin before, but now it is 1 jiao and 4 fen.</p>
<p>Paper: Japanese newsprint currently sells for 5 yuan and 4 jiao per ream, which is 4 jiao more expensive than the usual price of gold. Each case of 15 reams is about 6 yuan more expensive. Printing paper is calculated by weight, and each pound is more than 3 fen more expensive than before.</p>
<p>Flour: There are seven flour mills in Jinan. Since last year, sales have been declining day by day and business has been sluggish. The biggest reason is that south of Jinan along the railway line, Taian and Xuzhou each have flour companies. North of Jinan along the railway line, it could be sold well in Pingjin in the past, but now it can only reach Dezhou. East of Jinan along the railway line, close to the seaport, from Qingdao to Yantai and other places along the coast, all are sales areas for foreign flour. Jinan flour cannot easily go east. Sometimes, foreign flour can even extend its influence to Jinan. For example, in previous years, about 100,000 bags of various brands of Japanese flour, such as Treasure Stone, Goldfish, and Sun, were transported to Jinan for sale. For this reason, in addition to selling locally, Jinan flour can only be transported to the counties along the Xiaoching River and even Wuding. The sales area is narrow and business is sluggish. After the price of gold soared, Japanese flour can no longer come, so Qingdao and other places have sent telegrams one after another, ordering a large number of spot goods from Jinan flour mills. Its sales to Yantai, Haizhou and other places are also exported from Qingdao. According to yesterday's survey, in addition to Chenfeng, flour mills in Jinan such as Huifeng, Huaqing, Defeng, Fengnian, and Minan have all sold 7-8 carts or 5-6 carts, resulting in a shortage of supply in each flour mill and all inventories being sold out.</p>
<p>Flour mills in Tianjin have the same impact as Jinan. In recent days, Tianjin merchants have purchased a lot of wheat in Jinan. At this time of the old lunar year, when the business community is resting, and the source of wheat in the south is very small, the price of wheat has risen sharply due to this large amount of purchases. Ten days ago, wheat was 6 yuan 6-7 jiao per 100 jin. On the first day of the Jinan Grain Industry Association's transaction on the 6th of this month, it rose by 1 jiao per 100 jin. The next day, it rose by another 1 jiao. Yesterday (9th), it suddenly rose by more than 2 jiao, and each 100 jin of wheat was worth 7 yuan 1-2 jiao. Flour mills also increased prices according to the example, 5 fen per bag, and it rose by another 1 jiao today. (February 10)</p>
<h3>Relief for the Financial Crisis in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: At the end of the old calendar year, Fuzhou's various money shops were ordered by the provincial government to directly cash out the silver dollar notes they had issued. Because the shops' reserves were insufficient, a state of panic arose in the financial sector. Subsequently, the Financial Maintenance Association, organized by the money merchants' guild, requested the provincial government to postpone implementation until the Lunar New Year. At the end of the old calendar year, the Currency Regulation Committee borrowed 100,000 silver dollars from the Bank of China in Fuzhou on behalf of the Financial Maintenance Association to serve as reserves for the money shops to cash out the notes. People in society then said that the end-of-year hurdle had been passed and assistance had been received, so the money shops should be able to cash out the notes as scheduled. Unexpectedly, on February 1st, the Kaitai Money Shop on South Main Street was found to have suffered losses due to embezzlement by shareholders and managers, which became known to the public, leading to a run on the shop. The money shop was unable to cope and declared bankruptcy. At the same time, Fuping, Yuanlong, and Hongyu money shops were affected and also experienced runs one after another. Fortunately, the Financial Maintenance Association provided strong assistance, which averted disaster. The key figures of Kaitai Money Shop, such as shareholder Zhan Linsheng and manager Dong Zonghui, were arrested by the Public Security Bureau for investigation and liquidation. The shortfall was estimated to be more than 110,000 yuan, and they are now being ordered to find ways to clear the debt. However, the financial foundation of Fuzhou's business community is inherently weak. After this disturbance, the public's trust in money shops has greatly declined, and people are all trying to get rid of silver dollar notes and collect cash, causing the money shops' funds to become tight and the market's finances to stagnate. The money shops, business community, and government are now working together to find relief measures, which are described below: (A) On the money shops' side, the money merchants' guild has proposed three measures: (1) Abolish the return-to-scale cashing system and implement direct cashing to enhance public trust. The four shops of Chongji, Jixiang, Kangkai, and Shenyu Long are designated as the central mechanism for storing return receipt term notes. (2) Reduce the issuance of silver dollar notes to prevent runs, and instead issue integer silver tael transfer slips, specifically for inter-business transactions (i.e., when stores draw notes from money shops due to term settlements, the money shops will pay with these transfer slips; at the same time, when stores receive payments after the term, they will also return these transfer slips to the money shops. The money shops will then exchange the transfer slips from other shops for their own shops' transfer slips. If there is a surplus in other shops after the exchange, they will use cash to redeem it), so as not to circulate on the market. (3) Reduce loans to businesses. Before the financial situation returns to normal, the number of collection manuals issued to each business for drawing notes will be temporarily reduced by half. (B) On the business community's side, the Business Research Institute of various shops has resolved three items in a meeting: (1) All paper money must be cashed out in the future and cannot be used for offsetting. (2) Small money shops are not allowed to issue paper money. (3) Newly opened money shops are also not allowed to issue notes. In addition, a decision was made to submit a request to the Currency Regulation Committee to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the silver tael transfer slips that the money shops plan to issue. (C) On the government's side, the Public Security Bureau has submitted a report to the provincial government: (1) Please limit the number of money shops. Apart from the existing money shops, no new ones are allowed to open. Those that close are also not allowed to add names or transfer licenses. (2) Strictly verify capital, create a register, and prohibit movement. If the funds are less than the amount of notes issued, the money shop will be ordered to suspend operations. (3) Investigate the notes. There should be a fixed amount and no over-issuance is allowed. The notes must be stamped by the competent authority before they are allowed to circulate. (4) The money merchants' managers must provide joint guarantees to prevent embezzlement, losses, bankruptcy, and escape. Regarding the issue of direct cashing, the Currency Regulation Committee has also stipulated that it will be implemented from March 1st. Each money shop must not charge more than ten copper coins per silver dollar for cashing out silver dollars. Those who dare to violate this will be reported to the provincial government by the Committee for investigation and punishment. Small money shops are allowed to collect a handling fee of one copper coin per silver dollar for inward and outward cash transactions. (February 11th)</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<h3>Court Hearing Held for the Case of Li Genyuan and His Concubine Suing Each Other</h3>
<p>A record of the hearing: The case of Li Genyuan (formerly Premier of the State Council), who resides in Shiquan Street, Fengmen Nei, and his concubine Cheng Peiyi suing each other was heard at the Wu County Local Court at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 14th). Li himself did not attend, but was represented by attorney Tang Shenfang. Cheng Peiyi attended in person and retained attorneys Zhu Fucheng and Tao Jianshan for her defense. Judge Hu presided over the trial. Attorney Tang, representing Li Genyuan, reported on the circumstances of the relationship with Cheng, stating that Cheng had submitted a petition to the Women's Association accusing Li of being a remnant of the warlords, inhumane and cruel, which damaged his reputation. Cheng, through her attorney, sent a letter to Li demanding 100,000 yuan for alimony, which constituted extortion. Therefore, he was suing her on two counts. Cheng Peiyi then testified about the circumstances of her relationship with Li, stating that Li's accusation that she was from a brothel was defamatory, and that Li had instructed the monk Shi Ru to force her to become a nun, which constituted a violation of her freedom. Attorney Zhu then stated the reasons on her behalf, saying that Li had abandoned her. The judge initially advised reconciliation, but Attorney Tang refused, so he ordered Cheng Peiyi to post a written bond of 200 yuan and await a scheduled summons for all relevant parties to attend another hearing.</p>
<p>The following are excerpts from Li Genyuan's complaint and Cheng Peiyi's defense: (1) Li Genyuan's complaint states: "The defendant, Cheng Peiyi, was originally from a brothel in Shanghai. When Genyuan lived in Shanghai, he was momentarily careless and fell into the mire. Two years later, Cheng Peiyi suddenly came to Beijing, begging to be rescued from the abyss. At that time, feeling pity for her, he gave her preferential treatment and took her to his home, where she lived for half a year to maintain her livelihood. In the autumn of the year Yichou, she claimed to be going to Ningbo to study. Whether she enrolled in school or not is unknown, but there was still correspondence. At the end of the year Bingyin, my late mother sent my follower Xiong Jitai with 100 yuan in silver, two pieces of clothing, and many kinds of snacks to visit her in Ningbo. Unexpectedly, Cheng Peiyi had disappeared like the yellow crane. Since then, there has been no news of her. In March of the year Dingmao, my late mother passed away. In February of the year Wuchen, she was buried. Genyuan then suffered from carbuncles, which were extremely dangerous. The people of the country all knew this. He was discharged from the hospital in August. Shinmin and Shenbao in Shanghai published daily reports on his condition. Cheng Peiyi did not come to Suzhou to inquire about him, nor did she send a single letter or word. Her separate actions speak for themselves. More than two years later, she suddenly came to Suzhou in August of the 18th year and stayed at the Railway Hotel, brazenly hanging a guest card with the name Li Genyuan. She brought Cheng Peiyu and several unknown men with her to help her extort money. Genyuan ignored her. Cheng Peiyi and others exhausted their tricks and left. Later, they went to Shanghai and repeatedly hired lawyers to send threatening letters. Their purpose was nothing more than to defraud him of money. Recently, Cheng Peiyi and Cheng Peiyu have come to Suzhou again and are using various tricks to defame him. For example, on January 8th, Ming Bao published an article entitled 'Monk Advises Concubine to Become a Nun.' On January 9th, the Social Daily published a document submitted to the Women's Association, in which Genyuan was falsely accused of being a remnant of the warlords, inhumane and cruel, and a vicious and barbaric force, and Shulan was falsely accused of being ferocious by nature, concealing her flaws and flattering, punching and kicking, and being savage and unruly. Such deliberate slander, knowing that it is false, yet pointing it out and spreading it, damages the reputation of the plaintiff and others, and constitutes a crime under Articles 42, 325, and 328 of the Criminal Code. If he does not seek legal help, the situation will only worsen, and the harm will be unimaginable. Moreover, the defendant is using various methods to defraud him of money, which also constitutes a crime under Articles 42 and 263, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, he is filing a lawsuit, requesting your court to promptly bring the defendants Cheng Peiyi and Cheng Peiyu to court and punish them according to the law to show protection and prevent future troubles. Furthermore, the defendants have no fixed address. According to Article 41 of the Criminal Procedure Law, they may be detained directly without a summons. He also requests your court to detain them all. This would be a great favor. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<p>(2) Cheng Peiyi's defense states: "Regarding the case of Li Genyuan and others falsely accusing her of defamation and other crimes, the defense is made according to the law. The defendant is the daughter of a former battalion commander under Li Genyuan. In the 12th year, she was married to the plaintiff Li Genyuan as a concubine. They lived together in Tianjin and Peiping and never separated. The late Guan (Li Genyuan's mother) loved her more than usual. Later, because Genyuan's other concubine, Ma Shulan (i.e., the plaintiff), could not get along with the defense, she instigated Genyuan to refuse to let her enter the house, and even abandoned the defense outside based on one-sided accusations. After repeated negotiations, he refused to meet her. In desperation, she filed a complaint with the Women's Association, requesting assistance for the sake of self-defense. The plaintiffs dared to invite rogue monks such as Shi Ru and ruffians such as Sun Yuanpei to force the defense to become a nun. Their behavior is evident. Now, they dare to accuse your court based on a few sentences from the defense's legitimate self-defense petition to seek criminal punishment for the defense. Their intentions are malicious and obvious. Taking sentences out of context is not allowed by law. The crime of defamation under the Criminal Code requires an intention to spread the information to the public and an act of pointing out and spreading the actual shameful and evil deeds of others, resulting in harm to their social standing. The meaning of the defense's petition to the Women's Association was to describe the situation of Li Genyuan and others trampling on women's rights, so that they would understand the contents and provide assistance. This was a legitimate means of self-defense and is not punishable according to the provisions of Article 36 of the Criminal Code. Moreover, the terms 'remnant of the warlords,' 'inhumane and cruel,' and 'vicious and barbaric force' are transitional phrases. Only a remnant of the warlords would trample on women's rights, and only by trampling on women's rights would they be inhumane and cruel. Relying on their former official power to arbitrarily destroy women, how can they not be called a vicious and barbaric force? These terms are descriptive and not concrete facts, and their trampling on women's rights is a fact. This is a good-faith expression of self-defense and is not punishable under Article 326, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Criminal Code. Ma Shulan's ferocity, flattery, punching, and kicking are all supported by facts and evidence and were not fabricated by the defense and are not punishable according to the law. The defense has come to Suzhou on several occasions to negotiate with Li through proper procedures. Since the relationship has not been severed, using Li Genyuan's name in the newspapers is a sign of respect for her husband. How can it be said to be defamation? As for the charge of defrauding him of money, it is unclear what it is based on. In short, the defense's petition is the voice of the weak. There is no intention to spread the information to the public, nor is there any act of pointing out or spreading specific shameful and evil deeds. There is no result of harming the reputation of the plaintiffs. Therefore, the defense requests your court to review the case, promptly summon the plaintiff Li Genyuan to appear in court for questioning, and inform the defense that she is not guilty. Furthermore, the defense will collect evidence of forced monasticism and arbitrary abandonment in order to file a counterclaim within the statutory procedures. Respectfully submitted."</p>

<h3>Minutes of the County Government Meeting</h3>
<p>The County Government of this county held its 45th county government meeting yesterday to discuss the following matters: (1) It was resolved to investigate how many places in this county have been approved for the allocation of official or operational properties for the purpose of running educational and cultural undertakings or construction projects, etc. In the past, there was no register for handover, nor was a summary made to the Shatou Official Property Affairs Branch for record. As a result, disputes often arise in places that have been approved for allocation, making it difficult to handle them. It was resolved whether to issue a notice from the county to the Education Bureau, Construction Bureau, and various district branches to thoroughly investigate and determine the location of the official or operational properties that have been approved for allocation, the original name, the four boundaries of the parts, the original purpose for which the approval was granted, the current situation, whether or not they have been subject to taxation, and to draw separate maps with explanations, and to report to the county within one month for submission to the provincial government for re-registration and for notification to the Shatou Official Property Affairs Branch for future reference, in order to avoid disputes. It was resolved to proceed accordingly. (2) It was resolved to approve the budget and regulations for dredging the Tai Zhangjing, which was submitted by the Construction Bureau. Regarding the appropriation of dredging funds, the Convenience Shipping Company has submitted a report stating that it is willing to undertake the matter, so there is no need to discuss it for the time being. (3) It was resolved to determine the method for investigating school-age children throughout the county. It was resolved that the Education Bureau should formulate detailed methods and then submit them to the meeting for review. (4) It was resolved to investigate what to do with the large number of stone slabs and stone pillars on the street that have been built on the county road to Luoshen Temple. It was resolved that the Construction Bureau should ascertain the number and report it to the County Government, which would order the First District Office to take stock and preserve them. If they are needed for repairing roads and bridges, a report should be submitted for approval before they can be used.</p>
<h3>Meeting on the Reorganization of the Housing Police Donation</h3>
<p>Since the reorganization of the housing police donation in this city last year, it has increased by about 400 yuan.

If there are any questions, they can be raised at any time. (2) The rotation of the patrol officer of the Fourth Branch Office in the city should be handled in accordance with the precedent, and the County Public Security Bureau should be notified by letter stating the reasons and requesting action. (3) The branch office should report the closure and opening of stores to the District Office at any time.

<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Zhang Tinglu Commits Suicide Due to Unrequited Love. Zhang Tinglu, a resident of Hushe, Hangzhou, who once studied the rice business, was a handsome young man. Last year, he abandoned his job and devoted himself to the revolution. In the autumn, he encountered Miss Cheng Jingfeng in a rural area of Huzhou, and love blossomed. Their affection reached its peak. Recently, Miss Cheng suddenly transferred her affections to a talented student, treating Zhang as a stranger. Zhang repeatedly pleaded for a meeting, but was rejected each time. Suffering from this great shock and seeing no hope of reconciliation, he went to the home of his cousin, Shou Rusuo, in Yangmiao Township, under the jurisdiction of the county, on the 11th to stay for the night. The next day (the 12th) at noon, a member of the Shou family noticed that Zhang had not yet gotten up and knocked on the door. Upon entering, they found him lifeless. A suicide note and two opium pellets were discovered. The note read: "Cousin Rusuo, Tinglu was born at an inauspicious time, orphaned at a young age. He was raised by his uncle and aunt. His life is miserable.</p>
<p>As such, life holds no interest. After learning the rice business, I realized it would be difficult to succeed. Last autumn, I went to the countryside in Huzhou and fell in love at first sight with my beloved Miss Cheng Jingfeng (my dearest). We were inseparable, and I realized life still had a glimmer of interest. Who knew that a demonic obstacle would appear unexpectedly? The heart of my dearest beloved was taken by a demon, treating me like a stranger. I have visited her many times, but where once I was greeted with smiles, I am now met with closed doors. How quickly a woman's heart changes! Disappointed in love, I feel that the world is vast and uncertain, and the future holds no interest. It is better to die for love and end this misfortune. I am a weak person, resorting to a woman's act, swallowing opium pellets to commit suicide as my final destination. This life is over, may I repay in the next life. Please bury my unworthy bones facing west, and offer a remote sacrifice to my beloved. Please spread this story to the world. Even in death, I will smile in the afterlife. Farewell, do not grieve. 19.2.12.24. Zhong Tinglu's last words."</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Robbery at the Zhou Family in Mayuan. Mayuan is located outside the West Gate of Ningbo City, a remote and sparsely populated rural area. Zhou Zanqing, a carpenter in his forties, is quite well-off. He has two sons who are currently doing business in Shanghai. In December of last year, Mr. Zhou married a wife for his eldest son. The bride's dowry was very lavish, attracting the attention of bandits. One morning, around four o'clock, four bandits suddenly appeared, speaking a mix of Ningbo and Taizhou dialects. Each carried a sharp blade and a wooden club. They used a stone to break open the front door and rushed into the bride's room. The bride, out of fear, hid under the covers. The bandits stepped forward and forcibly removed two gold rings from her fingers and a gold bracelet from her arm. They also saw a silver pocket watch on the table and snatched it as well. After the robbery, the bandits left the house and fled towards the Zuguanshan area.</p>
<p>Young Woman Commits Suicide after Being Robbed. The daughter-in-law of a Mr. Ye, near the Lion Bridge in Cibei, was recently robbed while traveling by sedan chair to her mother's home in Ningbo, passing over Changxi Ridge. Her outer clothing was completely stripped off. When the woman returned home in the sedan chair, she was practically naked, with only a robe covering her lower body. By the time she arrived, she was half-dead from the cold and unable to speak. Mr. Ye questioned her husband and learned the details. He quickly gave her ginger soup to revive her, and she gradually recovered. However, on the morning of the previous day, the woman suddenly committed suicide by drinking lye. Her family tried to save her, but it was too late. Her limbs were already cold, and they had no choice but to prepare for her funeral. They telegraphed her son and notified her mother's family. However, when they were changing her clothes for the burial, they discovered that her lower body was severely injured, a truly tragic sight.</p>

<h3>The Problem of High Gold and Low Silver Prices</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Denies Reported Three Measures</p>
<p>Xu Kan, the Director of the Monetary Department of the Ministry of Finance, stated in a letter yesterday that the news article reporting three measures by the government to suppress high gold prices, which stated that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce intended to formulate temporary measures to suppress high gold prices, including having merchants voluntarily suspend the import of foreign orders and instructing customs to restrict the import of foreign silver, is incorrect. The Ministry has not jointly formulated such measures with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. If such news were true, it would be equivalent to stopping foreign trade, and the government would never adopt such a policy. Furthermore, according to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the recent surge in gold prices and the decline in silver prices have had a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. The National Government previously ordered the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Finance to jointly discuss relief measures. The two ministries then dispatched responsible officials to hold meetings, exchange opinions, and conduct in-depth discussions. They all agreed that adopting the gold standard was a fundamental solution, and that encouraging people to invest, promoting labor-management cooperation, advocating domestic goods, facilitating transportation, abolishing excessive taxes, urging international exchange banks to quickly establish overseas branches, and developing gold mines in the three northeastern provinces and Tibet were all processes to achieve this goal. It has been reported to the National Government for adoption and implementation. It is now heard that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been notified by the National Government's Civil Affairs Office that the relief measures have been decided by the 62nd National Government State Council meeting and handed over to the Executive Yuan, instructing all responsible departments to implement them earnestly.</p>
<h3>Customs Bans the Import of Foreign Silver</h3>
<p>One of the Ministry of Finance's Methods to Remedy High Gold and Low Silver Prices</p>
<p>Recently, foreign banks have frequently imported foreign silver, which has had a significant impact on the silver market. The Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs has received an order from Finance Minister Song to immediately implement a ban on the import of all foreign silver. After receiving the order, the Jianghai Customs will issue a notice for implementation within days, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will notify all countries to take note.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Gold and Silver Imports into China</h3>
<p>Secretly Reported by the North China Daily News</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that recently, there has been much discussion about the silver price issue, and the unprecedented abundance of silver reserves in Shanghai banks has also attracted general attention. Although there is a lot of silver in storage in Shanghai, imports continue unabated. Who is buying this silver and where is it being used? This is a question worthy of in-depth study. According to statistics on the import and export of silver and its circulation within China in 1929, the total value of silver ingots imported into China from the Americas that year was 85,117,925 taels (based on Kaiping silver, same below). The value of silver imported from Europe was only 7,066,916 taels. In addition, 1,829,330 taels were imported from India, 12,840,913 taels from Hong Kong, and 2,919,221 taels from Japan. Adding silver coins imported from Japan and India, valued at 829,515 taels, the total value of silver ingots imported into China from all these regions throughout the year was 100,374,305 taels (weighing 121,197,414 ounces), and the value of silver coins was 839,515 taels. The total imports in 1928 were 10,379,992 taels for silver ingots and 4,385,949 taels for silver coins, totaling 108,185,941 taels, while exports totaled 67,952,058 taels. In 1929, total imports were 118,744,294 taels, and exports totaled 59,319,861 taels.</p>
<p>The difference is 59,424,431 taels, which is more than 11 million taels more than the actual imports of the previous year. So, who is buying this silver and where is it being used? According to an investigation conducted a few days ago, most of the imported silver ingots have been purchased by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank. In addition, the Chase Bank has also purchased a significant amount. Most foreign banks already have very thick inventories and do not need to purchase more. For example, HSBC Bank has not imported silver ingots for a year due to its large silver reserves. The silver imported by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank has mostly been transported to Hangzhou to mint silver coins, which are then transported back to Shanghai and distributed to various ports in the interior (previously, silver ingots purchased by foreign banks were often cast into silver bars, not silver dollars). Furthermore, the total value of gold bars imported in the past year was 425,067 customs taels, including 158,027 taels imported from Europe and 266,400 taels imported from Hong Kong. The value of gold coins was 538,925 taels, so the total value of gold bars and gold coins was 1,040,752 taels, which is less than one-fifth of the 6,166,775 taels for the imported gold bars worth 2,991,607 taels and gold coins worth 3,175,168 taels in 1928. The total exports in 1929 were worth 2,925,698 taels.</p>

<h3>Zhao and Li Cross-Accusation Case</h3>
<p>Li Guojie Sues Zhao Tieqiao First Without Notification</p>
<p>Zhao Sues Li; Special Announcement for Indefinite Postponement</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was founded during the late Qing Dynasty. Due to significant losses, the National Government specially appointed a committee led by Zhang Renjie to investigate and reorganize the company in May of the 19th year of the Republic (1930). Subsequently, Zhao Tieqiao was appointed as the Director-General of the company. After Zhao took office, he had disagreements with Li Guojie (also known as Li Weihou), the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and they engaged in mutual attacks. Recently, Zhao hired Qin Liankui, Zheng Yuxiu, and other lawyers to accuse Li of criminal charges in the Provisional Court. Previously, Li had also accused Zhao of various crimes. The following is a transcript of Li's accusations against Zhao:</p>
<h3>Zhao Accuses Li</h3>
<p>(Above omitted) The case investigation shows that in May of the 16th year of the Republic (1927), the National Government, due to the China Merchants Bureau being controlled by bureaucratic merchants, specially appointed a committee led by Zhang Renjie to investigate and reorganize the company. Later, due to matters related to transportation, the National Government appointed Wang Boqun, the Minister of Transportation, as the Supervisor of the company. Wang appointed the plaintiff as the Director-General of the Director-General's Office of the China Merchants Bureau. In the 17th year of the Republic (1928), a General Management Office was established, with the plaintiff in charge of the overall affairs of the Bureau. In the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the Central Executive Committee decided that the China Merchants Bureau would be directly under the National Government, and the National Government would appoint a special commissioner to reorganize the Bureau. After the plaintiff was appointed by the National Government to act as a special commissioner, he was planning to reorganize the Bureau, but Li Guojie, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, publicly insulted the public official's execution of duties and withheld important documents, controlling affiliated agencies. The plaintiff saw that his actions were illegal and knew that he must have something to hide. Therefore, he found out that he obstructed the special commissioner from exercising his powers and undermined the business credit: (1) Embezzlement: The China Merchants Bureau has suffered losses over the years. The defendant, as Chairman of the Board of Directors, was in charge of the overall affairs of the Bureau before the plaintiff took over. Even if he had no faults in his duties, he could not be said to have made any contributions. However, in addition to receiving a monthly salary of 500 taels and a horse allowance of 50 yuan, he also created various pretexts to enrich himself at public expense. According to the investigation, at the end of the 16th year of the Republic (1927), the defendant paid himself a bonus of 5,000 taels in addition to his salary and horse allowance. According to the law, the remuneration of the Board of Directors should be decided by the shareholders' meeting, except as explicitly stated in the articles of association. The Bureau has no such articles of association as the basis, and the shareholders' meeting did not make such a resolution that year. The defendant paying himself public funds is undoubtedly an embezzlement of business-related holdings and should be subject to the crime under Article 357 of the Criminal Law. (2) Obstruction of Official Duty: The plaintiff was ordered to reorganize the China Merchants Bureau and drafted six rules of procedure, which were submitted to the National Government for approval and notified the Executive Yuan. The plaintiff was carrying out his duties in accordance with the rules. Article 3 stipulates that the commissioner represents the China Merchants Bureau externally. The defendant believed that this was inconvenient and published a circular, falsely accusing the commissioner of overstepping his authority. He even publicly published advertisements stating that anyone other than the Board of Directors who claims to represent the China Merchants Bureau in legal acts is naturally invalid, and that it is not appropriate for people other than shareholders to overstep their authority. He declared the rules of the specially appointed reorganization commissioner of the state, who was executing the state order, as invalid. This is a public insult to a public official performing his duties in accordance with the law and should be subject to the crime under Article 146. Furthermore, the 5 million yuan deposit contract signed between the China Merchants Bureau and HSBC Bank was signed by the defendant and kept by the Board of Directors. The original of the contract concerns all the important assets of the China Merchants Bureau and should naturally be handed over to the commissioner for safekeeping. However, the defendant refused to hand it over, clearly concealing the documents under the control of a public official in the performance of his duties and should be subject to the crime under Article 140 of the Criminal Law. (3) Undermining Credit: The defendant's circular was published in various newspapers, stating that the China Merchants Bureau had debts of 14 million yuan, and that not only was the principal impossible to repay, but also the interest was often in arrears, resulting in widespread complaints and disputes. The extent of its external credit is beyond description. In order to fight for power, he did not hesitate to destroy the Bureau's credit. This is clearly spreading rumors and damaging the credit of the China Merchants Bureau and should be subject to the crime under Article 330 of the Criminal Law. Please summon the defendant for interrogation. (Below omitted)</p>
<h3>Summons and Mutual Arguments</h3>
<p>The Provisional Court approved the pleading, signed the summons, and sent it to the Huishi Police Station, ordering them to notify the defendant at No. 114 Yuyuan Road to appear in court for interrogation at the designated time. Yesterday morning, Judge Gao Junxiang of the court specially opened the first courtroom for the summons. The defendant, Li Guojie, did not appear but appointed three lawyers, Li Shirui, Tang Mingshi, and Luo Jiaheng, to represent him in court. First, the Chinese policeman who executed the summons stated that he had sent the summons to the defendant the day before, and the person who signed for it at the transmission room had taken it away, but the defendant had not appeared in court today. Immediately, the lawyer representing the defendant Li stated that the defendant was unable to appear in court today due to unavoidable circumstances and requested a postponement. However, there were several points that needed to be clarified. The defendant had filed a statement with the court on the 24th of last month, accusing Zhao Tieqiao, the plaintiff in this case, but had not received any notification to date. Therefore, he requested that this case be tried together with this case, as there were several related issues between the two cases, to avoid wasting time. Furthermore, the defendant had a chronic illness. He had gone to the office to handle business the day before, but his old illness recurred yesterday and he had to go to the hospital for treatment. Moreover, the defendant was unable to prepare his defense due to time constraints, so he requested a postponement and submitted a doctor's certificate proving that the defendant was ill. Judge Gao then gave the certificate to the plaintiff's lawyer, Qin, to review, who said that the circumstances of this case were extremely important. Although there was a doctor's certificate to prove the defendant's illness, there may be other reasons, and he requested that the court appoint another doctor for an examination. After Judge Gao reviewed and reported the matter, he stated that the defendant's illness had been proven by a doctor's certificate, and it seemed unlikely to be false. Therefore, the case was postponed indefinitely. If the defendant recovers, he can report to the court, and another hearing will be scheduled. The court was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Li Accuses Zhao</h3>
<p>Li Guojie's lawsuit against Zhao Tieqiao is attached below: (Above omitted) The defendant's crimes: (1) The plaintiff has the right to establish a General Audit Office and a Design Committee, but the defendant did not allow it to be established, which is an encroachment on authority. The economic receipts and expenditures are also freely disposed of by the defendant, and the monthly report is not submitted, so the plaintiff cannot know the truth of the economy. (2) The doorkeeper patrolmen used privately by the defendant also had their salaries drawn from the Bureau, totaling an embezzlement of 1,000 taels of silver. (A) The expenses for private gifts, donations, and banquets were also paid from the Bureau's funds, embezzling a considerable amount. (B) The expenses for the wages of the defendant's private chauffeur, as well as gasoline, repairs, and licenses for the car, were also drawn from the Bureau. (C) On July 11 of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), 5,066 taels of silver were drawn from the cashier's department, and the account stated that it was used for various expenses handled by the Director-General, all of which went into his own pocket. (D) 1,412 taels was subsidized for the shipping magazine in the 17th-year (1928) accounts. There was no magazine published, and it was for personal use. (E) Deduction of coal tonnage. The above crimes constitute the crime under Article 357, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law. (3) After the defendant took office as Director-General, the number of personnel he appointed was three times higher than when the Board of Directors was in charge. There were no such positions as consultants, counselors, and advisors in the Bureau, but after the defendant took office, he created these positions and paid them very high salaries, and they did not even come to the Bureau to work. They were private appointments. (4) The National Government instructed the defendant to represent the China Merchants Bureau as a commissioner, and his authority cannot exceed the scope of the Bureau. However, on December 18, he ordered the plaintiff to dismiss the manager of the Jiyu Real Estate Company and appoint Fu Jucun as the agent. The Jiyu Real Estate Company has nothing to do with the China Merchants Bureau. (5) The crimes committed by the defendant that have been fully discovered are temporarily limited to these items. Because there is no audit office responsible for detailed investigation of the Bureau's accounts for the past two years, how many criminal facts the defendant has committed is difficult to investigate at this time. All the books and records must be handed over to shipping accounting experts to conduct a detailed investigation with the Bureau's staff and obtain a report. Since the defendant was appointed by the supervisor, he used his power and opportunity to commit the aforementioned crimes and should be dealt with more severely in accordance with the regulations of Article 140 of the Criminal Law and with a private prosecution: (1) Requesting the court to order the defendant to return all the embezzled funds. (2) Ordering the defendant to return all the deducted coal money. (3) Compensating for the losses caused by the embezzlement and deduction. (4) Prohibiting the defendant from continuing to commit the above-mentioned criminal acts. (Below omitted)</p>

<h3>Commercial Reorganization Committee</h3>
<p>Petition to Revise the Chamber of Commerce Law</p>
<p>The Executive Committee's Quorum of Only Fifteen is Insufficient for Service</p>
<p>The Relationship Between the Chamber of Commerce and Trade Associations is Uncertain</p>
<p>The Commercial Reorganization Committee, in order to request the revision of the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law, yesterday</p>
<p>Submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating: (Omitted above) Upon investigation, our association respectfully acknowledges the promulgated organizational outline, specifically regarding the scope of authority outlined in Article 3, Section 2, which mandates the drafting of unified organizational charters based on laws and regulations. Furthermore, according to Article 4, it is stipulated that the association shall exercise the functions of the former four chambers of commerce. Therefore, regarding laws and regulations concerning commercial organizations, there is a sincere obligation to offer suggestions for your ministry's consideration. We respectfully note that Article 18 of the Chamber of Commerce Law states that executive committee members and supervisory committee members of the chamber of commerce shall be elected from the representatives of the members' congress, with a maximum of fifteen executive committee members and a maximum of seven supervisory committee members. Considering the nature and responsibilities of the executive committee members, this number is roughly equivalent to that of the old Chamber of Commerce Law. According to the old Chamber of Commerce Law, the number of directors was stipulated to be between thirty-three and sixty, because prosperous commercial areas include representative commercial groups that are ten times or more numerous than those in commercially simpler cities. Since the chamber of commerce takes trade associations as its basic organization, it is necessary to ensure that representatives elected by each trade have the opportunity to participate in the affairs of the chamber, so as to encourage their interest in serving the public organization, and the affairs of the chamber will become increasingly sound. Chinese merchants are accustomed to considering it noble not to participate in public affairs, which is why the organization of joint-stock companies often fails in eight or nine out of ten cases. Furthermore, there is a lack of cultivation in the use of politics and the training of civil rights. It is appropriate to broaden the number of executive committee members so that each trade, once it has elected representatives to join the chamber of commerce, has the opportunity to be elected as an executive committee member, so as to practice discussing public affairs and cultivate talents for future self-governance. There is no remuneration for this service as executive committee member, but it is feared that they will avoid it as if it were something filthy, rather than worrying about excessive competition. Therefore, a generous number is inherently beneficial and without harm. Moreover, observing the recent situation, the duties of the chamber of commerce are becoming increasingly complex. Even regarding the former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the number of sub-committees established is as many as eight or nine. Each sub-committee's members, depending on the complexity of their affairs, must have at least three or five members, and as many as nine. If there are only fifteen executive committee members, it is truly insufficient for allocation. If one is forced to use the fixed quota of fifteen for distribution, it is called sub-committees, but it is no different from overseeing everything, still falling into the flaw of being broad but neglecting the details, and failing to achieve the benefit of each committee focusing on one thing. There is concern that it will be insufficient to cope with the complex environment, and the affairs of the chamber will turn to neglect. As for the existing industrial and commercial trade associations in this city, there are nearly two hundred, with executive committee members serving four-year terms, and half being re-elected every two years. The term of office is longer than that of the old Chamber of Commerce Law, but the quota is only one-quarter of the highest limit of the old Chamber of Commerce Law. Therefore, apart from paying membership fees and attending the annual general meeting, nine-tenths of the trade associations have almost no relationship with the chamber of commerce. The purpose of this revision of the Chamber of Commerce Law is truly based on the scattered organization of the past, and a desire to reform it. The general meaning of the reform can be summarized in two aspects: one is to concentrate power, and the other is to tighten the organization. If according to the above judgment, nine-tenths of the trade associations have almost no relationship with the chamber of commerce, then the unity is even weaker, and the organization also appears dispersed. There is concern that it will be insufficient to live up to your ministry's great intention to innovate the Chamber of Commerce Law. Regarding the number of executive committee members, we humbly believe that it is appropriate to refer to the provisions of the old Chamber of Commerce Law and re-revise it. An important point of this new Chamber of Commerce Law, which is completely different from the old Chamber of Commerce Law, is that the establishment of a chamber of commerce must be initiated by five or more industrial and commercial trade associations in the area. Therefore, industrial and commercial trade associations are the basic organization of the chamber of commerce, and their relationship can be described as profound. Therefore, the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law should maintain its consistent spirit, and the relationship between trade associations and the chamber of commerce should be stipulated in detail, so as to avoid them still becoming two separate entities in practice. However, upon reviewing the full text of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law promulgated this time, it seems to have no relationship with the chamber of commerce at all. In the past, for the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law, when establishing a trade association, whether or not there was a need for organization still required the chamber of commerce to investigate and verify,</p>
<p>And issue a certificate before applying to the government for registration. Now, even this is gone. Furthermore, since industrial and commercial trade associations have the responsibility to initiate the chamber of commerce, it must be that in places without industrial and commercial trade associations, companies or shops are allowed to initiate and organize industrial and commercial trade associations. Since they are the basic members of the chamber of commerce, their status is actually different from before. According to this theory, their joining the association is a natural and obligatory one, not one that can be arbitrarily joined or withdrawn from, which is the most obvious thing. However, on this point, there is also no provision, and it is deeply worried that the abuses will inevitably shake the very foundation of the chamber of commerce organization. Even if the abuse does not reach this point, it is feared that the chamber of commerce will be merely a shell, unable to encompass various commercial organizations in the city and become a great and solid organization, subtly becoming the center of commercial</p>
<p>Influence. It can be asserted that regarding the mutual relationship between the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law and the chamber of commerce, it is humbly believed that it must be carefully revised. These two matters are the most important issues related to the organization of the chamber of commerce, so we dare not fail to offer our humble opinions. Apart from our association drafting unified organizational charters and preparing for the procedure of organizing unified organizations, which will still be handled in strict compliance with the currently promulgated laws and regulations, and we dare not delay it slightly because of this, all of our respectfully submitted humble opinions are intended to request your ministry to review and approve the reasons for carefully revising the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law, and submit them to the National Government for submission to the Legislative Yuan for careful revision, in order to facilitate implementation for the public good. We respectfully submit this to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<h3>The Minquan Warship Re-trials</h3>
<p>Acting Minister Chen Arrives in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>The newly completed Minquan warship of the Navy Department is scheduled to sail to the outer reaches of Wusongkou to Chongming Island at around 7:00 AM this morning for a second trial. Li Shijia, the ship's supervisor, arrived in Shanghai last night from Beijing. It is also heard that Acting Minister Chen Shaokuan also took the night express train from Beijing last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning. He went to Gaochang Temple and instructed Ma Ji, the director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, Luo Zhitong, the acting captain of the ship, and Wang Zhiguang, the supervising adjutant, to go together to supervise the trial. It is also heard that the live ammunition test firing may be postponed. The ship is scheduled to return after the trial is completed today, around 5:00 PM this afternoon. Tomorrow (the 16th), the Haipeng twin-winged aircraft will also be test-flown at the Hongqiao Airport, so Chen Shaokuan is scheduled to return to Beijing on the night express train tomorrow night.</p>
<h3>Food Investigator Lu Jiawei's Talk</h3>
<p>Lu Jiawei, the director of the Capital Food Management Office and chairman of the Food Committee, previously investigated the production, sales, storage, and transactions of food in the Ninghu area. On the 8th, he went to Wuxi, Jiangyin, Changshu, Kunshan, and other places with Wang Zuohua and other staff members of the office, and arrived in Shanghai early on the 14th. A reporter from the Guomin News Agency, considering the importance of the food problem in the capital, which is watched by China and foreign countries, went to Lu's private residence on Fusheng Road to inquire about everything. According to reports, the population of the capital recently numbered about 530,000 to 540,000 according to the police department's statistics, but there are continuing exchanges, so it is assumed to be 550,000 people. The monthly consumption of rice is about 82,500 stones, and the source is mostly from Jiangning, Jurong, Lishui, and other places, accounting for about 60%. However, last year it was only 40%, and the rest was supplied by Anhui Province. According to the statistics of the 18th year, the average monthly total of grain and rice passing through Anhui Province exceeded 150,000 stones. From the situation, there is actually no reason why there should be a shortage of food in the capital. However, due to its proximity to Shanghai, all prices, transportation, storage, and other items are always subject to the principle of the market. Therefore, price fluctuations are entirely subject to the law of supply and demand in the central market, and the amount of the source accounts for a very weak reason. The reporter also asked, the former municipal government had a proposal to purchase 50,000 stones of medium-quality rice from outside each month from February to June this year to stabilize market prices. Did you bring this task with you this time? Lu replied that our office had previously proposed this item and submitted it to the municipal government as a relief measure during the lean months of April and May. However, the distribution method with food companies has not yet been determined, so this time it is only for investigation. Actual purchases must wait a little longer. In fact, the purpose of my visit is purely because the rice market must be very sluggish in February, and the price of gold is so surprisingly high, while foreign rice has fallen slightly unexpectedly. This kind of abnormal state is actually a hint of a sharp rise in the future. Now, food merchants are taking advantage of the cheap price to purchase, and selling it at the same high price when the price rises in April and May. At this time, the government must not have a corresponding price limit measure to restrict it. As a result, the profit from the price increase in the future will only be reaped by general merchants, and both production and sales will suffer. This not only hinders people's livelihood, but also harms agriculture. Therefore, while our office is trying to study the reasons for the weakness of foreign rice, it is even more necessary to personally go to the Xihu area to explore the truth of the current market in order to seek a response. The reporter also asked, what is the way to respond? He replied that the matter is very detailed, but I hope that the relevant local authorities will, based on the principle of national economic interests, seek a proper solution, so that weak areas will not be oppressed by capital cities and accept high-priced burdens. At the same time, the consumption area will not be restricted by the production area. This is the element of future contact and cooperation. The reporter also asked, what are the observations from this inspection? Lu said that in Wuxi, the focus is on transportation and storage, while in Jiangyin and Changshu, the focus is on the preparation of farmers for spring plowing this year. In Kunshan and Bacheng, the focus is on their milling business. The former two are still optimistic, but the milling factories, because too many have been established in recent years, the business is deteriorating day by day, and there is already a general trend of decline.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Agriculture and Mining</h3>
<p>Planning to Establish a Fertilizer Manufacturing Plant</p>
<p>Vice Minister Chen Comes to Shanghai to Convene the Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>The import of artificial chemical fertilizers is increasing day by day. According to investigation reports, the import of fertilizers in the past few years was only several hundred thousand yuan, but in recent years it has increased to more than ten million yuan. The rate of increase is more than double each year. If this continues, not only will the rights and interests flow out and leakage is worrying, but also the right of agricultural production in our country will also be manipulated by foreigners. The Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, in view of this, has repeatedly discussed establishing a fertilizer manufacturing plant in order to manufacture domestic fertilizers and resist foreign goods. This plan has been investigated and contacted in many ways, and there are already clues. It is planned to first set up a preparatory committee at the Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Institute to actively plan and carry out the plan. Yesterday, the ministry sent Permanent Vice Minister Chen Yu, Department Chief Xu Tinghu, Hu Shuhua, Inspection Institute Director Yao Xinghuang, Chen Huanzhi, Liu Hongsheng, Ye Huijun, Gu Xinyi,</p>
<p>Zhuang Dezhi and others as preparatory committee members, Section Chief Yang Gongzhao, Inspection Institute Deputy Director Cai Wuji, Zheng Chengqing, Tang Qichu and others as the association's executive secretaries, Yu Qianshan and Jiang Hanluo as the association's secretaries, and designated Vice Minister Chen as the chairman of the committee. It is heard that Vice Minister Chen will come to Shanghai within days and will convene the inaugural meeting of the preparatory committee on the 16th to discuss all the procedures for implementation.</p>
<h3>The End of the County Executive Committee</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai County Executive Committee took over the work from the steering committee last spring, the achievements have been very good. Now, after the deliberation of the Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, the organization of the executive committee still has imperfections, and it is considered necessary to reorganize it. It has already been instructed to stop activities and prepare for the transfer of power. On the one hand, it ordered Wang Liping (Zi Ziguang, Dangshan native), the executive committee member of the association, to be the custodian and wait for reorganization. After receiving the order, the county executive committee has been rushing to handle the transfer of power, which can be completed in about 20 days. It is approved that the association is a first-class county association, with a monthly expenditure of 1,600 yuan. Since August last year, the county finance bureau has only issued 1,200 yuan, resulting in salary deductions for colleagues in various jobs and difficult living conditions. Now, it has suddenly been ordered to stop, and most of them have no accumulated food, or even have debts that are difficult to clear. Therefore, yesterday, a meeting was held with all the working colleagues to discuss and decide to request the executive committee to allocate a severance allowance from the existing balance, equivalent to one month's regular salary, in order to avoid sitting in difficulty. If the executive committee approves the request, the end of the work will be rushed to be completed last night, or it will be completed and handed over within the 16th and 17th. The six district party departments under its jurisdiction have been instructed by the executive committee to stop activities at the same time and wait for the province to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Cortes's Speech</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>In the countless years of the past, China, Japan, and other countries in the world have diverged as if they were living on another planet. When Europe was still in the Dark Ages, China had already invented printing, papermaking, and ink, and Genghis Khan of Mongolia actually connected Europe and Asia into one piece, opening a road from west to east, which was later traveled by Marco Polo to Yuan Dynasty. After Marco Polo returned to Europe, he wrote a book that is still used by Europeans to study China. After Marco Polo, a group of wandering priests in Europe followed him to China. The method of printing classics with woodblocks by Buddhists was to transmit printing to Europe. Then Gordon Bao published woodblocks with letters, and then cast them into lead characters. The European movable type printing technology was greatly advanced. The oldest European printed book is Marco Polo's Travels. Later, this book was passed on to Columbus, who thought of following the sea route to China, and unintentionally discovered the Americas. Even until his death, he did not know that what he had discovered was the New World. At that time, the development of printing caused great changes in the ancient truths and European culture. The Middle Ages came to an end, and the modern century began. In terms of religion, it promoted great reforms. In terms of science, it improved human life with various new wisdoms. The new political system, which is now implemented in Europe and the United States and will be adopted in Asia, also arose. I say that when China is able to seek the truth, it will be able to solve its own problems. Do you still think of my words as a dream? I hold the ancient statue of Marco Polo and show a look of surprise. Do you find it strange? When I was in the Western YMCA, someone asked me about the saying (East is East, West is West, and the two shall never meet). What do you think? I replied that this is the saying of a blind man leading the way, who wants to use the simplest words to make the most absurd talk. Someone said that the truth of the West cannot be used in the East. Those who make this argument must be careful. The electric light in this room comes from the laws invented by Hengpei Erfuertuo and Fara Dui. This law can be applied to foreign countries and can also be applied to China. Now I dare to say that there is also a kind of cause and effect law in human affairs that is true in Europe and America and also in Asia. I can talk to you about one thing. A young student studying in the United States</p>
<p>An executor of lawyer duties once told my friend, (I know that you must think that justice must be separated from administration and independent. You can't think like this in China. This system cannot be implemented in China.) When I heard his words, I believed even more that his words were wrong. If China wants to seek freedom, it must make the organization of the government conform to the universal laws of the world. Without an independent court, the people cannot obtain freedom. This kind of law is as reliable as the electric light in the room can be based on the law to achieve it. I have studied politics all my life and I would like to describe the truth of politics to you in the simplest words. The government of the dynasty has become a relic and cannot be revived. China will never maintain order with dynasties. The only system that can be maintained outside of autocracy is a government that conforms to public opinion. Regular elections express the public opinion of the people. If the people are not given the opportunity to criticize politics and finance, and the local election system is carefully promoted, it is not enough to establish a solid government. I dare to predict that the government in China must organize a public opinion institution to criticize its policies and must make the budget public as the basis for people's criticism before the government can be stable. When I traveled to Japan, I felt its strength very much. Please tell you why I have this feeling. Each newspaper is full of cases of interrogation of corrupt officials and bribery. Those who sell official positions and titles will not escape the punishment of the law. The Japanese people's daring to do this is enough to see that they have the ability to be confident and independent. Self-confidence is the basis of various beliefs in the world, and belief is the foundation of various forces. The above-mentioned various principles are what I deeply believe must be taken into account in order to establish a permanent system in China. Now I dare to say one more thing. After my careful investigation, the Nanjing government, which is recognized by various countries as able to represent the whole country, is the most perfect government that can be expected to be built in the history of the scattered China. I urge the people of the same race and culture to take the same view. I also refer to the current Nanjing government and refer to its future possibilities. No matter where, any system that cannot be improved will be eliminated. The Nanjing government that we recognize can become the government that China needs, and I believe it can be achieved. I have a deeper reason for hoping so. I am a true believer that the ultimate goal of mankind is universal harmony and hope that there will be a day when it will be realized. The rule of universal harmony is a gift from God, and the people must make it themselves. A few years ago, I made a map to show the size of various countries. When I was working, I saw that the Chinese accounted for a quarter of all mankind, and their number was very surprising. In recent months, I have felt that the quality of the Chinese people is even more surprising. Regardless of the size of the nation, its quality is more important than its quantity. When I arrived in China, I saw that wars and disasters were repeated, and hundreds of millions of people died from freezing and starvation, and agriculture and industry were depressed, and the whole country was rioting. But I finally felt that the Chinese people could stand on an equal footing with other nations. I am about to leave China, not only for the great feelings of Chinese men, women, old and young, but also for the great respect. The Chinese people are just like the raw materials in the world that have not been artificially processed. In the future, they will be able to form a good society that has never been seen in the world. If a superman here thinks of forming a world of great harmony, if he sees that China has such good raw materials waiting to be built, will he not be happy to engage in it?</p>
<h3>YMCA Clean Government Movement Conference</h3>
<p>Second Diary</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the YMCA Clean Government Movement Conference on Sichuan Road. More people came to visit the conference, and more people signed to oppose dog racing and roulette. There are displays of the Shanghai Bank and the Four Lines Savings Association at the conference, welcoming visitors, sending out brochures, and having receptionists cordially receive visitors, explaining the methods of saving at any time. At 5:30, it was said that Qian Xin would give a speech, but he did not arrive due to an incident. Shi Jiyuan, the deputy manager of the Shanghai Association of the Four Lines Savings Association, gave a speech on the importance of saving. Yang Bingxun did shorthand in the national language, briefly saying that the psychology of savers is not the psychology of speculators. It is very difficult for people who live on salary to save money, but it is not difficult to develop a saving habit first. Saving is not mammonism, but a spirit of sacrifice. Promoting saving is a way to control capital. The reason why the American oil magnate made a fortune is because of investment. The way to save money is to have a budget and final accounts for personal finances, and save where you can. Investment is not speculation. We should put our money in the bank because construction requires capital, and capital comes from savings. Saving can save the country, because with savings, we can develop industry and make our country more hopeful. In the evening, the Public Rest Society performed a new play.

<h3>Shanghai-Wuhu Will Have Long-Distance Telephone Service</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications is making great efforts to build a national long-distance telephone service. The line between Shanghai and Wuhu has been completed since it was prepared last year. It was initially scheduled to officially start the call on the 10th. Since it is a single line, it was not clear after the trial call, so it was temporarily announced to stop calling. It is now engaged in repairs, and it can be connected in a week. From the Chinese community in this city to Wuhu, it costs 1.95 yuan for every five minutes. It is also heard that the Ministry of Communications, in addition to the Shanghai-Wuhu long-distance line, will also launch the Shanghai-Hankou, Shanghai-Tianjin, and Shanghai-Pingjin lines. The preliminary plans are still being prepared and have not yet begun construction.</p>

<h3>Statistics on Lost and Abducted Women and Children</h3>
<p>Most of Those Lost Are Between the Ages of Eleven and Sixteen</p>
<p>Those Who Run Away Are Mostly Adopted Daughters, Previous Daughters-in-Law, Maids, and Apprentices</p>
<p>Due to the frequent traffic, large population, and extravagant customs in this city, cases of getting lost, abductions, and escapes are seen every day. Fortunately, local government police officers pay attention at all times, which has remedied many situations. However, which ages are most common for men and women who get lost, are abducted, or run away is a matter worth noting. A reporter from the Wuchen News Agency specifically went to the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate. According to a certain gentleman of the bureau, according to the bureau's statistics on lost and abducted women and children in the 18th year, most of the lost boys were under the age of ten, with 91 people, and most were between the ages of eleven and fifteen, with 115 people. Only 10 people were over the age of sixteen. The trend is slightly the same for girls. For example, there are 88 people under the age of ten, 109 people between the ages of eleven and fifteen, but 63 people between the ages of sixteen and twenty, and 9 people between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-five. From this, it can be seen that most of the children who get lost are in the stage of eleven to fifteen years old, because children of this age are more capable, bolder, and inevitably run around. When they run too far, they get lost. Therefore, parents should pay attention to the actions of children under the age of fifteen. As for the girls, why are there still so many lost over the age of fifteen or sixteen? It can be seen that Chinese women go out and move around less. Many sixteen or seventeen-year-old girls cannot distinguish east from west and are prone to getting lost. Regarding abduction, men over the age of fifteen are no longer seen, and there are 54 people under the age of fifteen. However, looking at the girls, there are 29 people abducted under the age of ten, 38 people between the ages of eleven and fifteen, and 41 people between the ages of sixteen and twenty. Until the age of twenty-one to thirty, it is reduced again, but there are still 11 people. It can be seen that girls are most easily abducted in the ten years from the age of ten to twenty. In these ten years, they are young at first, and then their blood is unstable, and they are easily seduced by others. Moreover, in the current society, women still cannot avoid secret buying and selling. Looking at the runaway men, there are only 81 people, and there are 234 women, which is almost a ratio of one to three. Moreover, most of the men are under the age of fifteen, and most of the women are between the ages of eleven and fifteen, with 117 people. As for the reason why there are so many, it can be said that it is nothing more than the reason of adopted daughters, previous daughters-in-law, adopted daughters-in-law, maids, and girls. The second is those under the age of ten and those between the ages of sixteen and twenty, each with 50 people. Most of the runaway men are apprentices, and the rest are mostly due to family pressure. Looking at the above statistics, parents should know how to prevent it.</p>
<h3>Local Court Yesterday's Hearing</h3>
<p>Nantong Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry</p>
<p>Three Accused, One Already Dead</p>
<p>Court Trial Lasted Eight Hours</p>
<p>All Victims Appeared to Testify</p>
<p>More Witnesses to be Summoned for Joint Inquiry</p>
<p>Xu Shanji, Xu Chengyuan (already deceased), and Wu Xuan, former directors of the Xiting District of Nantong, and others, were reported to the Shanghai Local Court last year by teachers Zhou Yixiu and Xu Yanggao, who hired lawyer Ma Junshuo, as local tyrants and evil gentry. Among them, the victims were Qin Yueqing, Qin Buye, and others, accusing Xu Shanji and others of colluding with each other, oppressing the people, and embezzling public funds, among other charges. After accepting the case, the court ordered Xu Shanji, Wu Xuan, and others to appear in court. After the prosecutor completed the investigation, he ordered Xu and others to post bail, and filed a public prosecution against Xu Shanji and Wu Xuan. Yesterday at 10:00 a.m., Judge Deng opened the trial until 6:15 p.m. when the court adjourned, a trial lasting eight hours. The judge did not have lunch, working on an empty stomach, and the parties concerned could only wait hungry in the courtroom. First, the plaintiffs Zhou Yixiu and Xu Yanggao testified that the defendants Xu Shanji and Wu Xuan embezzled several thousand taels of public funds (it is said that in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Nantong County Government ordered the directors of Xiting District to raise 25 bond coupons, and they raised more than 8,000 taels, but Xu and others only handed over more than 2,000 taels). The defendants Xu Shanji and Wu Xuan shirked their responsibilities in their testimonies. Victim Qin Yueqing testified that Xu solicited 200 yuan worth of 25 bond coupons from him, and also raised 70 yuan for defense military expenses. Qin Buye testified that Xu solicited 210 yuan worth of coupons from him. Xu Jingxian, Xu Shiping, Xu Jiwu, and others testified that Xu solicited 130 yuan worth of coupons and 70 yuan for defense expenses from them. The receipts presented were not receipts for 25 coupons, but receipts in the name of loans from Xu and others (not registered with the county government), issued to the victims. Xu Botong testified that he was the former director of the local administrative bureau, established on March 1, and notified the directors Xu Shanji and others on the 9th to quickly hand over public funds, public property accounts, and registers. It was not until the end of June that Xu and others handed over all the accounts and registers. Because the accounts did not match, a review meeting was held, and a request was submitted to the county government to order further retrieval of the accounts and registers. Xu submitted the accounts and registers twice, but they still did not match, and so on. Zhang Erkang testified that he was the former cashier of the director's office, and everything was overseen by Director Xu, and so on. Xu Xingmu testified that he only raised 15 yuan, but the villagers only gave 25 bond coupons and did not know anything about market loans. Because of my involvement, I cannot admit that 25 bond coupons were transferred into market loans, and the account stated that Xu Xingmu spent 10 yuan, but there was no such thing in my case, and so on. Lawyer Ma Junshuo gave an account of the case. The judge considered it too late and ordered the defendants Xu Shanji and Wu Xuan to be detained pending further summons of witnesses for joint inquiry and verification. The court then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Yangxing Town</h3>
<p>Villagers Worship Guan Yu, a Wave</p>
<p>Peaceful Persuasion</p>
<p>The Disturbance is Pacified</p>
<p>In Yangxing Township, Baoshan, a wave of smashing idols occurred last year. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 13th of this month, around 3:00 p.m., a second wave occurred due to the worship of idols. In the central market of Yangxing Town, there is a Guan Yu Temple. The First Branch of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>is located in the temple. Since the abolition of shrines was implemented in all circles last year, the officers and police of the branch have destroyed all the clay idols enshrined in the main hall of the temple, and converted it into a hall. The statue of Guan Yu was temporarily moved to the back of the hall for preservation in accordance with the standards for the retention or abolition of shrines promulgated by the Ministry of the Interior. Since then, villagers have been prohibited from burning incense in the temple. According to local customs, the period from the 15th to the 27th day of the lunar January is the date for worshiping Guan Yu, which is extremely lively. The day before yesterday (the 13th) was the first day of the Guan Yu worship period. Around 9:00 a.m., the town chief Tan Shuxin led more than 20 villagers to the temple, intending to bring out the Guan Yu idol for worship, so that ordinary farmers could burn incense at the temple. Shi Wenhuan, the patrol officer of the First Branch of the County Public Security Bureau in the temple, immediately dissuaded Tan and others, but the villagers were numerous and noisy. Knowing that it was difficult to reason with them, Patrol Officer Shi immediately ordered the police to drive the villagers out of the temple. After leaving the temple, the villagers gathered to discuss. At 3:00 p.m., Tan Shuxin, Wang Kaijia, Xu Ayuan, and others were elected as representatives to go to the First Branch and negotiate with Patrol Officer Shi, saying that Guan Yu was a famous historical figure in ancient times, and should be worshiped by the people, just like commemorating Sun Yat-sen, and asked to allow the people's request, and so on. Patrol Officer Shi replied that even if worship was allowed, it had to be reported to higher authorities for approval, and so on. Unexpectedly, while they were negotiating, dozens of villagers suddenly rushed in from outside the temple, forcibly carried the Guan Yu idol from the back of the hall to the main hall, placed it in front of the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, and lit red candles. The villagers then knelt down one by one. Fearing that an incident would occur, Patrol Officer Shi immediately reported to the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau by long-distance telephone. Director Shen Jing was out on official business, and Chief Inspector He of the bureau received the call and immediately dispatched more than 20 armed police officers to Yangxing by car to suppress the situation. He also reported to the county government and asked for instructions on how to deal with the situation. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Wu Jianong immediately convened Sun Qixian, the chief of the First District, and Chief Inspector He of the Public Security Bureau to discuss how to deal with the situation. They all advocated using peaceful methods to persuade the villagers, so as not to cause further trouble. At that time, it was already around 7:00 p.m., and a phone call came from Yangxing, indicating that the situation was even more tense. District Chief Sun of the First District, and Wang Desheng, the representative of the county government, took a special car to Yangxing around 8:00 p.m. the night before, summoned the representatives of the people, Tan Shuxin, Xu Ayuan, Wang Kaijia, and others, to the Yangxing Office of the First District, and instructed the representatives to stop the worship. The representatives' attitude was initially quite strong, but after District Chief Sun enlightened them in many ways and added threats, the representatives agreed to inform the villagers and decided to stop the worship at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 14th), and promised to ensure that nothing unexpected would happen. District Chief Sun and others then returned to the Baoshan County Government in the original car around 12:00 p.m. the night before to report the situation. It is now heard that at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the villagers did indeed stop the worship and carried the Guan Yu idol back to the back of the hall for placement. A disturbance was thus pacified.</p>
<h3>Mistakenly Eating Pufferfish Roe</h3>
<p>One Dead... Three in Danger</p>
<p>Zhou Hengcai, 40 years old, a native of Gaoyou, Jiangbei, who lived at No. 107 Jiangbei Thatched Cottage, Zhuhu Lane, No. 125, Jiangbian Wharf, Gaochang Temple, made a living pulling a rickshaw. His wife, Chen, 31 years old, went to the street to buy vegetables at 12:00 noon the day before yesterday (the 13th). She passed by the garbage dump at Jiangbian Wharf and found four large pieces of fish roe (pufferfish roe). She picked it up and brought it home to cook. After she and her husband, Zhou Hengcai, ate it together, they suddenly felt abdominal distension and numbness in their bodies. At that time, Zhou instructed his wife, Chen, to throw away the bowl of leftover pufferfish roe. Unexpectedly, the neighbor Xie Zhenchun, 45 years old, also worked as a rickshaw puller. His wife, Xu, 39 years old, was also from Jiangbei. The Xie couple saw Zhou Chen about to throw away the fish roe, so they asked Zhou Chen for some to eat. Unexpectedly, after the Xie couple ate it, around 2:00 p.m., they suddenly felt abdominal distension and pain, and numbness all over their bodies. At that time, the Zhou couple were already lying in bed in pain. Xie's wife, Xu, ate the most, so she was poisoned too severely and immediately collapsed to the ground and died on the spot. Xie was still breathing. Fortunately, the neighbors found out and, seeing this tragic situation, immediately reported it to the Gaochang Temple Second District Police Station. Officer Niu led many police officers to investigate. They first ordered the police car to send the three people who had not died from the poisoning, Zhou Hengcai, Zhou Chen, and Xie Zhenchun, to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. It was heard that the hospital's rescue was rapid and they would be safe. Officer Niu of the district police station reported the incident to the Second District Headquarters in writing. The matter was reported because on the 14th of this month, according to the report of Bao Xianming, the patrol captain on duty, and Zhang Guangquan, the police officer at Post No. 40 of Jiangbian Wharf, Zhou Hengcai, 40 years old, a resident of No. 107 Zhuhu Lane, and his wife Chen went to the street to buy vegetables at 12:00 noon on the 13th of this month, and picked up pufferfish roe on the way home to cook and eat. Suddenly, they felt abdominal distension and instructed his wife to throw away the remaining fish roe. It happened that the Xie Zhenchun couple in the neighboring thatched cottage asked them for some to eat, and suddenly felt abdominal distension and pain, and numbness all over their bodies. His wife, Xu, was poisoned too severely and died on the spot. In addition to sending the three people who had not died from the poisoning, Zhou Hengcai, Zhou Chen, and Xie Zhenchun, to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment, it was also found that Xie Zhenchun went to the hospital for treatment, and he would be able to leave the hospital soon. The Zhou Hengcai couple are still being treated in the hospital, and they are generally safe. All of the above reasons are in line with the written report.</p>
<h3>Western Police Officer in Shanghai Commits Suicide in Toilet</h3>
<p>Gun to the Temple</p>
<p>Rescue Too Late</p>
<p>A certain British Western police officer, No. 254 of the Jing'an Temple Police Station in western Shanghai, had not been in office for long. At 11:00 p.m. the night before, the police officer suddenly went to the toilet of the police station alone, closed the door, and committed suicide with his own pistol. When the police chief heard the gunshot and broke down the door, the police officer had already fallen to the ground, with a bullet hole in his temple, his brain broken and bleeding. He was about to be sent to the hospital for rescue, but he had already closed his eyes and died. The police were then dispatched to carry the corpse to the Philan Road autopsy office. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday morning, the British Deputy Consul in Shanghai immediately appointed a judge to come to the office to clarify the matter, and it was confirmed that he had committed suicide. He ordered the family to sign a settlement to collect the body for burial.</p>

<h3>Meningitis Discovered in Baoshan</h3>
<p>Recently, epidemic meningitis has been discovered in Baoshan County. At first, there were only one or two people, so the authorities did not pay attention. In recent days, more and more people have been infected with this disease and died without treatment. For example, the Liu girl in Baoshan West Gate and a post office messenger were infected the day before yesterday and were sent to Shanghai to the Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, they both died on the way before reaching the hospital. After learning about this, Wu Jianong, the magistrate of Baoshan County, immediately telegraphed the provincial</p>
<p>Department to forward the information to the Ministry of Health, requesting that measures be taken quickly to provide relief to prevent the spread. At the same time, he instructed the Public Security Bureau and the autonomous region chiefs to pay special attention, and established clinics, purchased vaccines, and carried out universal vaccination. It is learned that Hu Hongji, the director of the Shanghai Special City Health Bureau, received a telegram from the Ministry of Health yesterday regarding the above situation, and immediately dispatched section member Yang Yujie to Baoshan together with Yang Baolin, the inspector of the Wusong Health Model District, to investigate the current situation. After meeting with County Magistrate Wu, he went to the clinic for a week of inspection, and told the doctors of the clinic, "From now on, for patients with the above conditions, you must examine the symptoms and take the mucus from the patients' throats and send it to the Health Bureau for examination before you can determine whether it is epidemic meningitis, so that preventive measures can be taken."</p>
<h3>Mengjiang Temple in Gaoqiao District</h3>
<p>After the Gambling Arrest, Robbers Arrived</p>
<p>The Mengjiang Temple in Gaoqiao District, Pudong, is always lively during the Lantern Festival every year. The villagers use this as an excuse to gather at this temple for gambling for several days, with considerable gains and losses. Around 11:00 p.m. the night before, when the gamblers were happily gambling in the temple, the Fourth Precinct of the Third District of the nearby Public Security Bureau learned of this and immediately sent police to arrest them. When they arrived at the temple, the gamblers spotted them and knew they were coming to arrest them, so they scattered and fled. When the police officers went forward to chase them, they only caught five or six people and immediately brought them back to the station. Unexpectedly, about an hour after the police officers left, more than 20 robbers suddenly arrived. They learned that there were a large number of gamblers in the temple, and they thought it was a rare opportunity to make a fortune, so they all took out their guns and rushed in, intending to loot. Unexpectedly, when the bandits entered, they were greatly disappointed, because the gamblers had already been arrested by the police an hour earlier and had fled, and there was no one in the temple. So they stripped off the fur robes of the temple caretaker and the members of the Qingyin troupe in the side room, and injured the caretaker in the head, before leaving dejectedly.</p>
<h3>Customs Brokerage Industry</h3>
<p>Opposing the Public Dues, Continued Hearing</p>
<p>The French Concession's entire customs brokerage industry, in opposition to the French Municipal Council's newly promulgated public dues, which include the industry in the public dues, specially convened all colleagues yesterday afternoon to discuss relief measures. Managers from Xiang Yigong, Pu Yigong, Taikoo, Xinrenhe, Xinchangtai, Tongyugong, Hanxingong, Xinxingyi, Yiji, Ganfeng, Changsha, and other firms attended, and Xie Hexiang was elected as chairman. A Western letter from the French Municipal Council was reported, and it was learned that the industry was included in the public dues, with different amounts set. The customs brokerage industry is only engaged in loading and transporting goods for customers, and the lodgers only have signboards. It is not comparable to inns and public buildings. The Municipal Council should consider the difficulties of business and withdraw the order to collect dues, and so on. After a long discussion, it was decided to send letters to the French Concession Taxpayers' Association and to ask the Commercial Federation of this road to forward the appeal to the public heads for treatment, so as to achieve the purpose of cancellation. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>A Man and Woman Break into Someone's House for a Secret Meeting</h3>
<p>Truly Absurd</p>
<p>Huan Liu, a woman from Shaoxing, who lives at No. 3, Fifth Alley, Mingxing Lane, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, rents out the wing room downstairs to Chen A'gen, a carpenter. Yesterday morning, Huan returned home after buying vegetables and found that Chen's door was tightly closed. She was very surprised, because Chen usually did not close the door when he went out to work. Suspicions arose, and she peered through the cracks and saw a strong man and a young woman sleeping with their necks intertwined. She was very surprised. After taking a closer look, she realized that she did not know the two people. She went out to call the police and broke down the door, arresting the pair of unexpected lovers and sending them to the Fourth District Headquarters in charge. According to the man's testimony, his name is Wang Liansheng, 46 years old, of No. 3 Zhifuli, Yaojia Stone Bridge. Because his residence was inconvenient, he asked someone to find him a house. Now his friend Yao Zhenghua rented him the front building of the plaintiff's house. So he went to check the house with his lover Zhang Zhu. Unexpectedly, there was no one in the room. So he and Ms. Zhang rested briefly in Chen A'gen's bedroom. Unexpectedly, they fell asleep. He asked for leniency. The woman, Zhang Zhu, testified that she was 22 years old and that Wang had called her to the plaintiff's house to talk. He said that the house was rented by Wang. Who would have thought that she would suddenly be arrested by the second landlord and taken to the police station. The director said that Wang had led a woman to break into someone's house for a secret meeting, which was harmful to public morals, and ordered them to be detained for 15 days as a warning.</p>

(Reasons) Based on reports from anti-opium comrades in various regions recently, opium seedlings are still being planted in Rehe, Liaoning, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Guizhou, Henan, and northern Anhui, and opium taxes and fines are collected as before. Moreover, most of them are forced planting rather than voluntary by farmers. Unless the opium suppression authorities secretly dispatch commissioners to various provinces to thoroughly investigate the opium planting situation and the livelihood of farmers, and study remedial measures, it will be insufficient to achieve a fundamental eradication. (Measures) It is requested to the Opium Suppression Committee not to trust the official reports from various provinces, to make a thorough decision, and to secretly dispatch commissioners to the provinces that have traditionally planted opium to conduct separate investigations. The main points are listed below: (1) Opium planting areas: Have they been effectively eradicated? (2) Is there any situation of troops forcing planting and collecting taxes? (3) The livelihood of farmers. (4) Other crops suitable for replanting opium fields.</p>

<h3>Chinese and Foreign</h3>
<p>The Yizhen Society Allocates Relief Funds to Wenzhou and Taizhou</p>
<p>Wenzhou and Taizhou prefectures in Zhejiang Province suffered successive wind, insect, water, and drought disasters last year. After the major disasters, coupled with the unusually cold winter, the disaster victims in Yongjia and other towns in Wenzhou, as well as in Yueqing, numbered in the tens of thousands. They all gathered in Yongcheng to beg for food. The accumulated snow covered their calves, and the famine corpses lined the roads. The tragic situation can be imagined. In Taizhou, heavy snowfall continued in winter. In the mountain valleys, the accumulated snow was almost as tall as people. On the plains, the roads were covered with snow of several inches. Many thatched houses and old buildings were crushed and collapsed. Vegetables and grass were frozen and rotten, and their roots and stems were gone. It was difficult for the two crops of wheat to grow. Without clothes or food, disaster victims died of hunger and cold. In urban and rural villages, everywhere had that. Although the various agencies have been providing emergency winter relief, it is only a temporary solution. However, the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Yizhen Society believes that the spring famine is even more critical. If it is not maintained, the previous efforts will inevitably be wasted. Therefore, they specially donated 10,000 yuan to relieve the two prefectures. The money has already been remitted in advance, with half given to the Yongjia Charity Organizations Coordination Association and half given to the Linhai Relief Office for distribution to the disaster areas. According to the regulations, Chinese and foreign personnel will jointly supervise the process to ensure that the benefits are shared equally, which can be said to be timely assistance.</p>

The detective Liu Shaoqing, Jin Juxian, and others were ordered to go to the French Concession to retrieve the stolen goods, but they were unable to do so. The police are currently under orders to purchase lines and arrest the fugitive. It is hoped that the correction will be made immediately, without bearing any expectations.

<p>Teachers May Not Organize Labor Unions</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan replies to the Ping Municipal Government</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The Primary School Teachers Association previously drafted regulations for the staff and workers union of Beijing University to organize a primary school teachers and staff union, and requested approval for registration. The municipal authorities telegraphed the Executive Yuan for instructions, and the following directive has now been received: "Your telegram has been noted. Article 3 of the Labor Union Law states that staff and employees of educational institutions may not adopt this law to organize labor unions. Furthermore, Articles 16 and 23, Paragraph 4, both mention labor unions organized by workers in various industries listed in Article 3. Therefore, within educational institutions, only workers may organize labor unions. Teachers are included within the staff and employees mentioned in Article 3 and may not be regarded as workers, and thus may not invoke this law to organize labor unions. Regarding the mayor's previous telegram requesting instructions on the types of professional and industrial labor unions in Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Labor Union Law, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has reported that provincial and municipal governments should first follow local conditions and adhere to the indicated standards for provisional division and implementation, and then report to the responsible ministry for review. This has been submitted to the National Government and resolved by the State Council to be referred to the Legislative Yuan for review. Further instructions will be issued upon review and approval. Please take note accordingly."</p>

<p>Thirty-seven students, including Yang Bosen and Zhao Shu, who were admitted by the Central Party Headquarters to study in the United States, were initially unable to obtain passports because the American Consulate had not received instructions from the American government.

The director of the Diplomatic Office, Chen Shiguang, went to the American Consulate to negotiate all the necessary procedures. According to the American Consulate's usual practice, passports were limited to ten per day. After negotiations, the Diplomatic Office issued a letter of introduction for each student, and all were signed by the American Consulate yesterday (14th) at 3:00 PM, and all processing fees were waived.

<p>昨日下午四時半起、中華籃球房有兩幕女子籃球比賽、結果（一）射星勝兩江、二十七比十一、（二）六星勝美公、二十七比十七、</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, starting at 4:30 PM, there were two women's basketball games at the Chinese Basketball Hall. The results were: (1) Shooting Star won over Liangjiang, 27 to 11; (2) Six Stars won over Meigong, 27 to 17.</p>
<p>射星克兩江　二隊於四時半起賽此爲女子公開錦標賽之一幕、開赛之初、形勢頗見平均、而後射星漸漸吃緊、上半時以十二比六勝兩江、下半時開始、兩江反攻順利、連加五分、造成十二比十一、相差僅一分、不料射星又逞威風、於是兩江一蹶不振、結果射星以二十七比十一勝、裁判員惠脱摩、按此賽並未終局、因裁判員判决不清、當第四節開始時、兩江球員忿而離塲、斯時裁判員即照比數、宣佈完畢、按此情形、兩江球員不願再戰、應作棄權論、不應作爲比賽結束、裁判員之玩忽職務、於此可見、</p>
<p>Shooting Star Defeats Liangjiang: The two teams started playing at 4:30 PM, marking one scene of the Women's Open Championship. At the beginning of the game, the situation seemed quite even, but then Shooting Star gradually tightened their grip. In the first half, they won over Liangjiang with a score of 12 to 6. At the beginning of the second half, Liangjiang counterattacked successfully, adding five points in a row, making it 12 to 11, with only one point difference. Unexpectedly, Shooting Star showed its power again, and Liangjiang declined. As a result, Shooting Star won with a score of 27 to 11, judged by referee Huituomo. According to the game, the game did not end. Because the referee's judgment was unclear, when the fourth quarter began, Liangjiang players angrily left the field. At that time, the referee announced the end of the game according to the score. According to this situation, Liangjiang players were unwilling to fight again, and it should be considered a forfeit, not as the end of the game. The referee's dereliction of duty is evident here.</p>

The Six Stars forwards were sharp, the shooting was well prepared, and the defense was tight and impeccable. Therefore, the Six Stars took the lead all the way and never fell behind. In the first half, Six Stars won 14 to 10. The result was 27 to 17, and the victory still belonged to Six Stars. The referee was Li Feiyun, and the inspector was Ms. Li Bailan.</p>

<p>A Laughing Matter by Hai Ke</p>
<p>A: I forgot my wallet at home. Can you lend me fifty dollars?</p>
<p>B: I don't have that much money. But I can figure out a way for you to get that amount.</p>
<p>A: What method is there?</p>
<p>B: Here are eleven copper coins. You can take the tram home to get your wallet.</p>
<p>Young Woman: Dear, I cannot be your woman.</p>
<p>Young Man: How dare you not love me anymore?</p>
<p>Young Woman: It's not that. It's just that I've become a member of the Women's Liberation Association and cannot be a man's plaything anymore. Why don't you be my plaything?</p>
<p>Old Woman (to a young man sitting on the tram): Sir, could you possibly let me sit down?</p>
<p>Young Man: Old lady, you're too old and your face is ugly. I'm sorry, I won't give up my seat.</p>
<p>Mother (to her son returning from school): Child, were you quiet in school this afternoon?</p>
<p>Son: How could I not be quiet? I slept straight through from the first lesson to the third. There wasn't a sound.</p>
<p>Frozen Corpse by Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Ice is a very hard substance. The degree of its hardness depends entirely on the temperature. The colder the weather, the harder the ice. In January of the 19th year, the weather in Jiangbei suddenly turned cold. River water froze, disrupting transportation for a month. During this time, there were daily reports of people falling through the ice. The most tragic of these was the incident of the frozen corpse. I am recording it to offer as conversation material for readers of this publication.</p>
<p>A man named Jia was a bill collector for Zhaoyang Guangyuan Foreign Goods Store. (Jia was in Shaobo and had a joint venture with someone to open a shop.) In early January, he was ordered by the store owner to collect bills from various villages. Jia took the opportunity to go home, bringing his concubine and young son, preparing to spend the Spring Festival in Shao(bo). On January 6th, the river was gradually freezing. Jia ordered the boatman to break the ice and proceed forward. He feared being blocked on the way if he delayed. However, when Jia's boat reached a certain river, a hurricane suddenly arose. Ice floes from upstream crashed down. The boat was suddenly overturned. The entire boat, including the boatman and passengers, more than ten people in total, drowned. The hurricane lasted all night. The river froze inches thick. On the glass-like surface, there was no trace of the boat. No one knew about this tragedy.</p>
<p>By the end of January, the river ice was as solid as ever. Farmers from various villages, seeing no hope of the river thawing soon, broke the ice to go to the city to buy goods. They discovered the incident. Family members, upon hearing the news, immediately hired people to retrieve Jia's body, along with his concubine and son. They were transported to the Beichantang Temple in Zhaoyang for burial. I personally went to the scene to observe. Jia's corpse was frozen as hard as iron. His concubine was still holding her son in her arms. The ice was so frozen, it was unbreakable. The mother and son were connected as one. It was heartbreaking to witness. During the burial, family members used hot water to wash the bodies. After more than ten baths, the bodies began to soften. Jia intended to bring his family to Shao to spend a happy Spring Festival. On the way, they encountered this major disaster. This is truly an unexpected tragedy amidst the frozen river.</p>
<p>New York to Use Robots as Police Officers by Guoxin</p>
<p>New York is the center of American commerce. The flow of traffic is heavy from morning till night, filling the streets. Even with police officers directing traffic everywhere, it is still not enough. Moreover, traffic regulations are extremely complicated. Relying solely on memory is a matter of concern. City officials are now considering a novel plan. All traffic control duties will be assigned to robots. These robots will be able to perform all the duties of a police officer, including issuing tickets and directing drivers to yield. They can designate directions, limit vehicle speeds on busy roads, and direct traffic in an orderly manner. They can also operate traffic lights on schedule, adjusting to urgent situations better than humans. They can also handle various other traffic signals without fail. The mechanism is ingenious and seemingly miraculous. However, when explained, it is quite simple. Several rubber pads are pre-placed at key intersections on the road. Underneath the rubber pads are layers of springs. The springs are connected to the robot by wires. Therefore, when a vehicle drives over the rubber pad, its weight and speed affect the spring underneath, and this information is transmitted to the robot. The robot can then open or close traffic signals according to the degree of impact.</p>
<p>Houses Without Doors by Gong</p>
<p>This is both a funny and tragic phenomenon. The disaster in Xinghua last year was no less severe than in the northwest provinces. It was unprecedented in decades. People had nothing to eat, resorting to tree bark and grass roots to survive. Eventually, even these were exhausted. Many starved to death. Yet, domestic philanthropists did not pay attention to it. As a result, many strong men went to Shanghai, some with their entire families, to find food. Some villages were almost entirely deserted. Walking through them was like entering an empty mountain. Even the sounds of chickens and dogs were gone. All the houses were empty. There was nothing left to steal. However, heavy furniture could not be taken away. So, the families blocked the doorways with bricks, making the houses inaccessible from the inside or outside. Upon returning, they could dismantle the bricks and live there again. During the time they were seeking food, there was no need for guards, eliminating worries. Therefore, houses without doors are a common sight in the Xinghua countryside today. All sides are walls. Those who don't know might mistake them for large, above-ground coffins. (Note: We call coffins placed above ground "above-ground coffins," as opposed to underground coffins.) However, looking at the current situation in Shanghai, the industry is in decline. Factories cannot maintain operations due to losses, leading to closures or partial shutdowns. For example, the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company has temporarily suspended operations in Shanghai. The original workers are already in oversupply and in a precarious situation. These refugees are coming to Shanghai to find food and work. I fear that even with strength, there will be no work available. Those waiting to be fed will remain trapped in a state of waiting, facing a dilemma. Alas.</p>
<p>Retreating Soldier's Tale by Jielu</p>
<p>A man named Jia, from Hangzhou, was initially a clerk at a store. He had a dispute with a colleague, Yi, which escalated. He grabbed a porcelain pillow and struck Yi. Yi fell to the ground, injured. Jia, fearing Yi was dead, fled in panic. He eventually became a member of Sun Chuanfang's army. When Sun's army was defeated, Jia and two comrades hid with a quartermaster, Bing, in a mountain near Longyou. The two comrades saw that the quartermaster, Bing, was carrying 20,000 in paper money. They conspired with Jia to kill Bing and divide the wealth. They tied Bing to a willow tree, ready to strike. Suddenly, Jia had a change of heart. He warned the two comrades about karma, saying that vengeful spirits would not disappear and that harming lives for wealth would not escape retribution. It would be better to divide the wealth and spare his life. The two agreed. Bing was spared. Later, Jia became a battalion commander in the National Revolutionary Army. He repeatedly achieved meritorious service. One day, he went out from the army camp and saw beautiful scenery in the countryside. Green mountains, white clouds, ancient trees, and the setting sun captivated him. He stood there, admiring the view. He took out binoculars to leisurely observe the scene. Suddenly, he saw a black object flying from afar. He quickly lay down to avoid it. A bullet landed on the ground with a hiss, only a few feet away. Dozens of soldiers used an ancient tomb as cover and exchanged fire with the enemy. The enemy thought that those hiding behind the tomb must be high-ranking officers. They aimed the large cannons at the tomb and began firing. Stones flew, trees broke, and the tomb was shattered. However, Jia's team was spared because Jia, without waiting for orders, had ordered his soldiers to retreat a few meters and line up against the enemy. From then on, Jia believed more deeply in karma. He deeply resented internal warfare. He abandoned his military career and became a servant at a school. Jielu read Li Hua's "Elegy for the Ancient Battlefield" and Du Fu's anti-war poems. He cannot help but sigh at the tragedy of war. After the outbreak of the European War, many European and American novelists wrote anti-war novels to warn those with warlike ambitions. Their intentions were good. Recently, someone wrote a short story about a soldier who saved a widow. Later, an enemy bullet hit a copper coin in his pocket, saving his life. Although the story is humorous and delightful, the principle of reward is the same as Jia's.</p>
<p>Wise Maid by Ji Jiong</p>
<p>Taihu Lake borders Jiangsu and Zhejiang. With vast expanses of water and winding waterways, it is a haven for bandits. According to a friend, Zhu, from the Shi Village on the lake shore, was a wealthy man. He suffered greatly from bandits. Because his ancestral property was there, he was reluctant to move. Valuable items had already been entrusted to relatives in the city. Only the master and a few maids were left in the empty house, taking care of cooking. On the twentieth night of last month, they suddenly heard a loud, urgent knocking on the door. A maid went out to answer it. She knew they were bandits. They warned each other not to open the door. The master was terrified. He and his wife huddled in a corner of the room, at a loss. By then, the bandits had scaled the wall and entered, carrying torches and weapons, very aggressively. The maid acted as if nothing had happened. She took half a bucket of kerosene and saw a pile of firewood in the backyard. She poured the kerosene on the firewood and set it on fire. The wind was strong, and the fire blazed fiercely. Smoke filled the sky. Villagers rushed to the scene. Then, the maid climbed to a high place and shouted, "Bandits in the house! Setting fires to call for help! Please come in from here!" At that time, a righteous man named Li was exceptionally brave. He was skilled in Shaolin martial arts. He carried a water staff in his hand. He met the bandits and fought and danced. The wind whistled, and hooks rang. Four or five bandits fell to the ground. The remaining bandits scattered and ran, unable to climb the wall. They knelt down and begged for their lives. Li threw the staff on the ground, laughed, and said to them, "With such skills, you dare to be bandits? It's pathetic!" He opened the door and let them go. The master was grateful. He asked to marry the maid to Li. He said, "This maid is young but exceptionally brave and intelligent. She will be able to manage the household in the future. What harm is there in keeping her in the kitchen?" Li agreed to choose an auspicious day for the wedding. It became a beautiful tale.</p>
<p>Zhang Fei's Head by Lan Yin</p>
<p>Many generals and ministers of the Shu Han Dynasty are popular figures, enduring through the ages. Zhuge Liang, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei are the most famous. To this day, there are still many historical sites in Sichuan that are praised by people. Zhang Fei's head in Ba County is particularly remarkable. According to a person from Sichuan, there is a majestic Marquis Huan Temple in Ba County. The people of Ba worship Guan Yu exceptionally. Marquis Huan has repeatedly demonstrated his divine powers. This is also recorded in other books and is not unusual. However, the temple still preserves Zhang Fei's head. It is stored in a large vat filled with oil. Every few years, during a grand incense festival, tens of thousands of men and women from near and far go to the temple to burn incense. The abbot opens the lid on that day and adds a few pounds of oil. This method has been used to preserve the head since the Shu Han Dynasty. The lid is not opened easily at other times. Therefore, those who want to see Zhang Fei's head must wait until the incense festival. The head does not decay and looks lifelike. The person who told me this had seen it with his own eyes. He said that it initially looked like a normal person, but the eyes were very large, wide open and unblinking. According to Zhang Fei's biography, he was from Zhuojun. His courtesy name was Yide (popularly mistaken as Yide). In his youth, he served under the founder of Shu, Liu Bei, with Guan Yu. He was brave and fierce. He once stood his ground with twenty riders at Changban Slope, preventing pursuers from approaching. Cheng Yu and others called him a "ten-thousand-man enemy." Since the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and stage performances, he has become even more vivid. Even after thousands of years, people can still imagine him and respect and admire him. It is unexpected that his head remains on earth, immortalized alongside his reputation. Guan Yu temples are everywhere, but in Sichuan, temples to Zhuge Liang (Marquis Wu), Guan Yu (Marquis Huan), and Zhao Yun are also commonly seen. Their love remains in the hearts of the people, as if they never died. Why do today's great men only care about the present and not pay attention to their legacy after death? Alas, lamentable.</p>
<p>Guan Yu temples are everywhere, and this newspaper is also everywhere. Can someone from Ba County take a photo of Zhang Fei's head and send it to be printed and published for the world to see? I think the Free Talk reporter would also welcome it. Written again by Lan Yin.</p>

<p>Heart Warming (128) by Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 8: A Feast Opens Where Delicate Birds Sing and Flowers Bloom. A Golden House is Completed for a Worthy Bird to Choose a Tree.</p>
<p>Ru Yun said, "There's no need for so many beads. Just embroider the two characters 'Ru Yun.' It can be used on foreign hats and Chinese hats alike." The eldest aunt said, "Everyone knows your name is Ru Yun. Why put the sign on your forehead? Like Yi Qing, she's always changing her style. After a while, she takes the beads off the hat and puts them somewhere else. It's a good thing for the bead embroiderers to do business. Besides, when we call the bead embroiderers, we have to watch them while they embroider. Otherwise, if we're not careful, they'll switch things out on us." Ru Yun knew her mother didn't want to, so she didn't say anything more. Actually, the reason she didn't want to was because she was afraid of spending money. As for the prostitutes in the brothels, they all relied on making fresh changes. That day, Zuo Shichen played for a while and had someone ask Liu Xingshu next door, saying that the eight-tile game was just starting. Zuo Shichen said, "I can't wait for him, I have to go back." The eldest aunt said, "Please come often in the future. After you're familiar with it, you can come and sit often when you have nothing to do." On March 30th, the people</p>
