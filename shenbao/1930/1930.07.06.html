<h3>日本政友會减稅協議</h3>
<p>大抵失政權而在野之政黨。必建立有益於人民之政策。以博人民之同情而圖恢復其政權。故人民者。每因其政黨失政權而得益。此各國所同也。日本政友會今以在野故。乃有協議减稅之舉。猶之今之日政府在野時。有金解禁及縮减政費等政策。藉以博人民之同情也。迨至政黨而一執政策權之後。雖所建之政策。未嘗不實行一二。而其外不滿意於人民之意者。又必因時勢而雜出。其他在野之黨乘之。又復建立一二足以窘迫政府。足以得民同情之政策。以取得政權。如是往復相循。各政黨雖時有起伏。而人民之因而得益者。亦復非鮮矣。雖然各國人民之所以能得在野黨之益者亦以他日政權之後。能實行其建立之政策也。而其所以能實行其政策之大原因。則因國家當興盛之時。財原充裕。應付便易之故也。假使自今以後。商業長此不振。人民之資產貧困。而政府之收入艱難。則未得政權時。建立之政策雖甚動聽。而一經執政。求其實行。恐非易易矣。故以我觀之。今後各國政黨政治之有益人民。將非昔比耳。</p>

<h3>歐洲聯邦運動</h3>
<p>及其當前難關</p>
<p>（駐歐特約通信記者化魯）</p>
<p>（二）白里安計劃書</p>
<p>戰後歐洲外交壇上的斷輪老手、要算白里安是第一個人了、法國乃維繫戰後十餘年來歐洲政治的樞紐、而白里安便是機關手、舊時代的許多外交人物、死的死、下台的下台了、而白里安老翁、還是靈光獨峙、法國的政黨和內閣、此仆彼起、而外交一席、終非仰仗此老不可、他一手訂成了羅加諾保安公約、他和凱洛起草了著名的非戰公約、國際聯盟仗着他做台柱子、楊氏計畫、虧他才能見諸實施、這些都是他所謂「和平組織」所謂「安全政策」的拿手好戲、所謂「和平組織」、就是維持法國從凡爾賽和約所得到的勝利、所謂「安全政策」、就是在幾個大國操持的局面下、維持着國際現狀、有了羅加諾、有了非戰公約、有了國際聯盟、又有了楊氏計畫、白里安還覺得不夠保障歐洲的安全、所以又有了他的歐陸聯盟的大文章、</p>
<p>去年九月九日、在國際聯盟第十屆大會的期間、白里安邀集歐洲二十七國的全權代表、在日內瓦舉行空前未有的「全歐聚餐」、在席間白里安代表法國正式發表歐洲大聯盟的提議、列席的各國代表、都表示贊成、當時就推定法國起草建議書、送交各國徵求意見後、再於今年九月的國際聯盟大會中、正式討論、這法國所起草的歐洲聯盟計畫、於今年五月十七日送達歐洲二十六國政府（均國際聯盟會員國、）向之徵求意見、更以同樣公文通知歐洲非國際聯盟會員之俄土兩國政府、及歐洲以外各國政府、我們且看這白里安的計畫書的內容怎樣、（三）全歐聯盟與國際聯盟　　白里安的歐聯計畫書、長至數千字、對於全歐聯盟的理想和實現的是具體計畫、都說的頗為詳到、全文可分爲兩部分、第一部分是序文、總述全歐聯盟的宗旨目的以及活動的范圍、第二部分是關於籌備及組織的程序、序文中說歐聯的主要目的、是爲促進歐洲的政治的經濟的社會的和平、在不和國際聯盟衝突的范圍內、謀歐洲各國間的合作、這新的聯盟、不但不和國際聯盟衝突、而且更不是在國際聯盟以外另行建立一種新組織、換言之、全歐聯盟、不過是國際聯盟內的、依地域爲單位所建立之一分部而已、加入全歐聯盟的國家、必須爲國際聯盟的會員國、歐聯的主要目的、在輔助國際聯盟及補充其所不足、此外屬於國際聯盟國際法庭及國際勞工局職權內的事業、全歐聯盟、不加侵越、且爲表明歐聯與國際聯盟的關係、歐聯的執行機關、亦設於日內瓦、這樣便把國際聯盟與全歐聯盟的關係、弄的很清楚、但在事實上是否沒有困難、却是一個問題、正如意大利報紙的批評所說、這全歐聯盟如不是贅疣機關、便不免和國際聯盟的根本精神衝突、因爲在國際聯盟內部、一部分國家另造成一種團結、勢必引起其餘會員國的猜忌、（四）全歐聯盟與國家主權</p>
<p>白里安的計畫內說、全歐聯盟並不含有和他洲或任何國家對抗的用意、歐聯的性質、不但和政治軍事同盟不同、而且也决不是那種以對抗別國爲目的經濟關稅同盟、原來白里安深恐美國猜疑、以爲全歐聯盟、是對抗美國的一種關稅聯盟、所以在計畫中再三說明、表明全歐聯盟只是謀歐洲各國的公共利益、而决不存心損害他國或他洲的利益、</p>
<p>其次所謂全歐聯盟、就白里安的計畫中所說、并不損害加盟國的國家主權、在聯盟內各國平等自由的地位、共謀合作、</p>
<p>同時並不損害其絕對主權與政治獨立、歐聯不過是各國間一種自由的結合、並非和北美合衆國德意志聯邦國那樣的聯邦組織、所以全歐聯盟、在國際法上不能當作一個聯邦國家看待、反之加入歐聯的國家、亦並不因加入聯盟組織而喪失其國家的最高權、</p>
<p>（五）實現的計劃　　這全歐聯盟如何方纔能實現、具體的計畫怎樣呢、就白里安所定的計畫、第一步先要訂結全歐公約、這公約內規定全歐聯盟的宗旨及組織大綱、由歐洲各國共同簽字、公約簽定後、全歐聯盟的基礎、方纔固定、至於聯盟的組織、分爲三部分、一爲全歐大會、每年開會一次、性質是一種聯盟國家的代議機關、聯盟國各派代表平等列席、爲避免任何國家操縱起</p>
<p>見、大會主席團應由各國代表按年輪値、二爲全歐委員會、是一種執行機關、由公約規定或大會選出部分的聯盟國代表組織之、其開會地點、應在日內瓦、三爲秘書處、爲常設機關、管理文件及召集開會等事務、地址亦在日內瓦、總之此種組織、完全以國際聯盟爲雛形、全歐大會、即等於國際聯盟的大會、全歐委員會、等於國際聯盟的理事會、秘書處等於國際聯盟的常設秘書處、</p>
<p>除此以外、計畫書內更擬定全歐聯盟活動幾個原則、（一）經濟的問題、附屬於政治的問題之下、（二）全歐政治合作的原則、（三）全歐經濟組織的原則、此等原則、只定一大綱、留待下次全歐會議討論、</p>
<p>（六）前途的困難</p>
<p>白里安所謂全歐聯盟的理想與計畫大槪如此、這計畫書送交歐洲二十六國政府後、各國政府將於七月十五日以前答覆、送致意見書於法國政府、再由法國政府匯集此項意見書、於九月間國際聯盟大會中報告及討論、所以這個計畫、是否能從一紙具文變成事實、我們看九月間的大會、就可以知道大槪了、</p>
<p>但是無論如何、沒有人敢信這樣大規模的聯盟計畫、能於短時期內成爲事實、全歐聯盟、即使有一天實現、也必須經過無數的波折、因爲就目前情形、歐聯運動的前途、伏着多種困難、這困難有起於聯盟外部的、就是美國和蘇聯的態度、有起於聯盟內部的、就是英意德諸國的態度、讓我們分頭來說、</p>

<h3>合作運動淺釋</h3>
<p>（一）合作運動、是世界新經濟組織運動、意在以合作社的組織、來救濟現代專以營利爲目的之經濟組織的缺陷、使由生產者與消费者雙方之聯络、以免除寄生階級的商人的漁利、即生產者不致受其操縱與壓迫、消費者亦不致被其榨取興宰割、并以和平節儉、公允自立與互助之方法、來消除商業戰爭、防止大企業獨佔、調和勞資衝突、絕减高利貸借、平允經濟利潤、</p>
<p>（二）合作運動可以團結民族精神、因中國民族最大之缺陷、即向來是散沙一盤故欲恢復民族固有之力量、及提倡崇高的民族認識、必先從團結入手、從事合作事業、即能獲得團結之利益、而無形中養成一種自立互助同德同心、同甘同苦之精神、爲團結民族之一大幫助、　　（三）合作運动動可以促進民權之發達、因民權發達、必須從訓練入手、故民權初步以爲「非集會不爲功」、在合作社內「權」操於社員之手、而「能」則由社員選舉專員負責、及合作社的「一人一票權」制、實具有民生的精神、其情形正與國家之權能分立相同、故由合作社內工作之練習、可爲選舉能罷免創制復决四權行使之訓練、而爲促成民權主義實現之良法、（四）合作運動是實現民生主義的第一步、合作運動之目的、在以人民自養爲目的、非如資本主義之營利爲目的、并以一定之計劃、以建成一個平等公允養民而有意識之經濟組織、其目的與民生主義相同、惟民生主義挾有政治的力量、是以法律的制度、他抑制地主與次本家之操縱、及保護農民及勞動者之權利、合作運動則純爲人民自身之努力、單爲經濟方面之組織、方法略有不同、但惟其如此、由合作運動努力所得之人民自身之經濟力量、可爲政治力量之輔助、而促成民生主義之成功、故合作運動是實現民生主義之第一步、而合作運動亦須在民生生議推行之下才得成功、是使合作民生主義化、非民生主義合作化、（五）合作運動是樹立地方自治的基礎、因地方自治是地方人民自己管理自己之政治與經濟的組織、由合作事業之經騐、可養成自助自立自衛之觀念、亦即可養成自治之根基、故總理在地方自治實行法中、即有自治機關應提倡合作事業之規定、今當籌備地方自治聲中、尤應提倡合作運動、以期彼此提挈推進（六）合作運動可以解除農民之痛苦、中國農民佔全國人口百分之八十以上、除因貸借困難、影響及於日常生活艱苦外、最受痛苦的是在耕者不能有其田、故總理平均地權之中、除制定法律以限制保護及獎勵外、仍有扶助農民購買土地使能「耕者有其田」之規定、合作社之功用、*</p>
<p>即能以聯絡協作精神、（一）應用消費合作社、使農民能從生產者或批發者直接購買日用必需品、免除被商人一轉手獲得之漁利、而節省日常費用、（二）應用供給合作社、使農民能共同購買肥料種子及工具、以增進技術的效能、而增加生產的力量、（三）應用販賣合作社、使農民能直接販賣、以免商人從中剝削與操縱、以增加生產的價格、（四）應用制造合作社、可使農民共同製造必須以機器制造的農產品、如乳酪之類、以增加日常之收入、（五）應用信用合作社、以流通資產、使農民得改善日常之生活、並能獲得資本、進而購買土地、而使耕者有其田、　　（七）合作運動是解放工人及小商人的運動、因工人亦同受缺少資本的痛苦、致建最低生活亦幾無法維持、故總理對於工人救濟方面、是規定最高限和最低限的工資、制定工廠管理法、確定勞動保險制、採用分潤制等方法、以資救濟、但凡此皆是法律的規定與同等的援助、若能從事合作運動、各人自身努力求解放、其成效則必能更速、因由生產合作社可使工人成爲工廠機器及一切生產工具的共有人、由建筑合作社可使工人得成爲房產共有人、由消費合作社可使工人得以改�</p>
<p>善日常生活外、並得成爲社中股東及儲蓄的共有人、其他如城市之小商人、其受經濟組織不良之痛苦、亦不亞於農工、故亦可組織合作社、使不受大商店的壓迫、減少進貨之成本、而能多生資本、以改善其生活、</p>
<h3>三民主義與合作運動</h3>
<p>陶其情　　誰也知道、三民主義是立足於仁愛之上而以「天下爲公」爲其實行的標的、合作運動的提倡、是要打倒投機和壟斷事業的剝削、更進一步、打倒資本主義的壓迫、正是以仁愛做基礎的、合作的真義「我爲人人人人爲我」「（Each　for　allll　for　eaoh)就是一方面主張爲我主義、又一方面更主張利他主義、確合乎「各盡所能、各取所需」的「天下爲公」底大同本旨、是則合作運動的提倡、正爲達到實行三民主義的要途、　　合作運動本是要解决經濟問題的癥結、把現有經濟制度改變一下、而以共享爲目標、當與民生主義關係密切、但就合作的原理和功能、稍一推闡、深覺合作運動、與民族主義民權主義、關係亦切、而可協助其實現、這合作運動關係於三民主義者、分述於左、　　（一）民族主義與合作運動、民族主義的最重大的使命、就是反抗帝國主義、帝國主義者侵略弱小民族的工具、一是政治力、二是經濟力、以政治力爲輔、以經濟力爲主、尤其在歐戰之後、各帝國主義者的侵略政策、便以經濟爲唯一手段、在弱小民族的自身、供帝國主義者的驅使、而助桀爲虐的、就是買辦階級和準買辦階級等、因爲有了買辦階級及準買辦階級的操縱和榨取、帝國主義者的經濟侵略的毒熖、益爲綿蔓無已、合作運動便以打倒榨取壟斷的寄生虫爲天命、國內既剷除了萬惡的買辦階級、則帝國主義者的經濟侵略、已失去了很大的膀臂、被壓迫的民族、因無「爲虎作倀」的內應、而帝國主義的侵略、也可難於爲害了、這就是民族主義達到了成功之域、</p>
<p>（二）民權主義與合作運動民權主義的最重大的使命、就是要實行民主主義的集權制度的政治、政治達到了民主集權制、才是眞正民治的精神、歐美代議制的政治、是行使間接民權的政治、及其結果、便變成資本主義的政治、故民權主義的精義、便是培植民主力量、由民主力量、以集權、更由民主力量行使其政權以管理政府的治權、這種民主力量、是以民爲本位、至於合作制的組織、絕對的以人爲本位、而不以資本爲本位的、這是一種極純潔的民主精神、正與民權主義的精義相合、經濟組織以及其他一切組織、完全以人爲本位、而不以其他事物做本位、便是民權主義入於成功之境了、</p>
<p>（三）民生主義與合作運動民生主義的實行、一要節制資本、二要平均地權、總理的意思、以爲中國的人民只有大貧小貧之別、沒有資本階級的產生、爲預防計一方使私有資本不至發達到有害的程度、又一方面發達國家資本、以民享爲目的、這二種的節制資本、即所謂共將來的產、合作的意義、就是防止資本主義的禍患、而使生產社會化、分配社會化、以共享爲主旨的、所以薛仙舟先生以爲節制資本的根本方法、應於民衆本身上做起、舍合作而莫屬、總理又以爲中國的土地、受着工商發達的影響將要由地權而有害民生、便主張平均地權、這平均地權目的、是要耕者有田、達到這種目的、薛仙舟先生也告訴我們、「舍合作外、亦沒有其他較優的辦法」、最初的社會、土地公有、無所謂地權、後來土地私有制的發達、農民的土地日被掠奪、而造成地主坐享快樂、以使社會因土地而生出不平現象、合作精神就是打倒社會上的寄生政策、又主張聯絡協作的精神、應用於「節省日常費用」「增加日常收入」和「流通資金」等具體實際方法、以求農民獲得資本、進而購買土地、這便是協助平均地權的照價收買和增價歸公的實行、合作運動不獨和民生主義關係密切、更足爲協助民生主義的實施、</p>
<p>在目前金貴銀賤的惡潮之下、米珠薪桂、物價飛昂、人民生活、日趨險境、推原其因、大都由於帝國主義者、國際資本主義以及國內買辦階級所造成、合作運動之急宜提倡、固爲協助三民主義的實現、更足救濟目前民生的困苦、</p>

<h3>合作運動的理論　玨人</h3>
<p>關於「合作」我們從泛義的說起來、人類想要達到、各種目的、决不能夠孤立無援、和小說上的魯濱孫飄流荒島一樣、勢必依賴朋輩的合作、因爲個人的力量、本來非常微弱、要把多數的個人集合起來、大家聯合、然後才能夠發揮必要的實行能力、不信我們只要拿近代工會的組織及活動看來、便可得到很大的敎訓、就是單祇「粗識之無」的勞動、者要是一度團結、便可成爲一個大勢力、不單只養成自治精神、而且能受知識的訓練、便是在人類的原始時代、憑團結的力量去禦外侮、求生存的例子、更不知有多少、可見通力合作、是人類一樁極要緊的事、自有人類以來、合作便老早有了的、人類的發達全部、歸根結局、完全可以說繫於合作的聯合如何而决的、</p>
<p>至於合作主義的根本思想怎樣、這個問題很難得一個簡單而含蓄的答案、第一、因爲合作主義所包含的問題甚廣、經濟問題、固然是主要問題、然而此外還包括政治、倫理、哲學、藝術等各方面的問題、第二、因爲合作主義的派別很多、以色彩論、有赤色的合作、有黃色的合作、以國界論、有英國式的合作、有比國式的合作、他們所理想的將來社會、旣各不同、因之合作主義的觀念、就不一致、而且合作的分類很繁、而各類合作社、又各有各的特徵、要想綜合各種合作下一個定義、這種定義又不犯籠統和偏見兩種缺點、實在感受莫大的困難、從前對於合作所下的定義是、Each　for　all　for　cach有人譯作「各個爲全體、全體爲各個、」意議太含混、每易引人們的誤解、現在有人譯爲「我爲人人、人人爲我、」雖比較的高明、但這樣的句子解釋合作、終嫌不甚顯豁、不甚完善、現在我們試下合作的定義如下、「合作社是結合經濟上力量薄弱的人們而成的互助之自由團結、其社員數目、沒有限制、至其目的、則以社員之平民的平等權利與自助原則爲基礎、爲完全他們經濟的道德的地位之故、依共同計算、在廢除利潤的目的之下、經營凡有企業、至由經濟的企業所生利益、不以股本爲標準、而從共同營業的本體所要求的分量而分配、」</p>
<p>我們眼見着現在經濟組織的缺點、我們對於合作運動的要求更迫、切合作認消費是因、生產是果、消費是目的、生產是手段、而消費又建築在消費者的慾求上面、就是爲滿足慾求而消費、所以合作的經濟組織、不僅不是營利、而且是立基於「消費者及社會的需求」上、</p>
<p>無論那一國的人口、總以勞働階級占大部份、而勞働階級無一不是消費者、如果到有一天、合作制度推行全國、我們所消費的東西、槪由我們自己生產、而一切商業機關工業農業、都操在合作社之手、試想此時社會上主人翁、難道還不是勞働階級嗎、</p>
<p>經濟制度一天組織在生產者的利益上面、如現在的樣子、資本便一天爲社會上的主人翁、工人則不過爲一種次要的機械、反之、如果一天將經濟制度改建於消費之上、而以消費者的利益爲基礎、那時就將以各人的需求及羣衆的多數爲社會上唯上的主宰、</p>
<p>工人不幸處於被雇傭的地位、將體力向人拍賣、以求作工、就須仰給資本家的鼻息、以聽其驅使、因求作工的人愈多、工人的勢力愈弱、資本家更可以選精拔萃、任意挑剔、如果工人以消費者的資格出面、則情形大不相同、人數越多、勢力越大、而最後的勝利、總是屬於工人的、</p>
<p>合作主義的學者金威廉博士告訴我們、『合作社中的資本爲積集得充足了、便可購買土地、社員都可以住在裏面、自己耕種、自己製造、一切的需要物品、那時衣食住都足以自給了』、</p>
<p>由上面的話看來、合作社內的資本、生產工具土地等、當然是社員的全體所有、如果擴大起來、全社會合作化時、那麼社</p>
<p>會的生產要具、通通歸社會全體所共有、這就是生產要具的社會化、所以合作運動的初步、是扶助弱者、抵制資本家的剝削、同時防止私人資本的發展、而最終目的、則在根本把生產工具的私有制打消、使生產工具供社會全體的需求驅使不爲少數人所利用、</p>
<p>再就經濟組織的意識性來說、合作者認定慾求是隨時代進化而漸進的、在漁獵遊牧時代、生產品旣不多、慾望也不大發達、到了農業時代、生產品也是大增加而特增加珷然而慾求亦復增大、所以在那時候、生產品和消費量還可以平衡、人類慾求可以滿足、後來到了商業時代、於是經濟組織起了很大的變化、因機械發明和資本集中的緣故、形成了大規模的生產、和依賴交換而行分配的制度、結果、一方面生產量突飛膨漲的增加、超過社會的需要、常常發現經濟恐慌、一方面沒有購買力的人、便得不對生產品的分配、甚至得不到生活的保障、</p>
<p>法國季特敎授說、「如果實行合作制度之後、生產者出產的數量、全隨大家的需求而增减、除各種意想不到的錯誤、爲人人所不能免以外、必然的使生產旣不太多、也不太少、生產與消費、而相符合、</p>
<p>總括以上所述、合作的目的第一是社員間的相互保障、第二是要得到生命的安樂、第三要得生活的獨立與安全、就是說、合作制度之下、社會對於社會全體各分子是負責保障的、平等待遇的、</p>
<p>合作運動是和本黨民生主義一樣的要建設一個有意識的共同社會、把這無政府狀態的經濟組織推翻、</p>
<p>又因爲實行分配的社會化、最有效的方法、莫如合作社、所以在國民黨的政策中、提倡合作運動、成爲主要政策之一、</p>

<p>變成了萬能的地方、拿金銀而作惡的很多、但爲了金錢生命受宰割的也不少、在這種地方、環境如是險惡、合作事業、更有提倡的必要、合作運動、更有宣傳的必要、所以本市黨政機關、聯合舉行合作運動宣傳週、關於合作的理論方面、有今天合作專家可以詳細講述、我們除掉感謝這幾位合作專家外开、他方面我們希望到會的幾位同志、大家都能夠同心協力、把這合作事業、發展起來、於最短期間、合作事業、在本市有一個很大的進步、這是今天舉行宣傳大會的意義、我們這一次舉行合作運動宣傳週、决不是空講了幾句、是要使一般民衆了解懂得、不但要了解懂得、並且要實際地推行合作事業、報告完了、</p>

<h3>𫆣翱翔小記　　　劉碩甫</h3>
<p>從飛機俯視大地奇觀亦壯舉也日。昨本報畫刋部。因欲以物質文明之上海都市全景。餉諸讀者。遂由王小亭君往商中國航空公司。乘該公司作試機飛行時。借以攝上海景物。事固尋常然實創舉。蓋以前京滬蓉綫航空公司雖有載客飛行之例。但絕對禁止空中攝影。此次經本報與航空公司接洽。竟蒙特許附載三人。俾得回時拍攝。更屬絕好機會。因屆其前往。同行者有王君小亭莫君天祥及余三人。嗣魯少飛君臨時亦欲加入。遂姑約同往。是日天色清明。氣候亦爽。余等抵飛機站時。機師已備機待發。本擬四人同乘。卒以機係試行。恐不能載重。只得留少飛少候。余等所乘之機。爲雙葉水上飛機。可載機師二人。乘客四人。入機後即以所携攝影器準備妥帖。蓋飛機攝影。大異尋常。一、須預定焦點。因機行極速。稍瞬即十餘里。斷無餘暇可資對光。二、不能從景物鏡中覓取物像。此亦因飛行太速之故。不容從容覓取也。三、不能假倚靠物以取穩定。蓋機身凌空。四無着落、機身無一處不爲引擎所震動。所憑藉者。其動搖之度。或且甚於手持。四、兩足須如騎馬式立穩。雙手持鏡箱。腰以上須能婉轉隨勢。然後注目景物。一遇有可攝之物。須立爲攝取。有類獵人之獵獸者然。以上諸點。因王君在飛機上攝影次數極多。在美國時曾有一次乘軍用飛機。以革帶束身於機葉上而拍攝新聞。以故人皆呼爲新聞王。彼於飛行攝影經騐極豐。承其事先爲余輩言如此。故得早爲預備。臨時尚不致手忙脚亂。機初行時。聲響極大。顫動亦烈。入水如汽油艇。機前激浪甚大。飛濺滿窗。幸小亭早爲之備。嚴禁余等開窗。得免落落湯之誚。俄而漸無浪珠。俯視則已離浦數十尺。機漸升。平穩如乘舟。因憶春水船如天上坐之句。此則天上船如春水舟矣。機飛高百尺。廛閭田疇。咸渺小如玩具模型。王君即囑機師捩機飛繞於熱鬧街衢之上。余輩亦遂開始工作。計繞外灘三匝。餘如滬西閘北虹口等處。均飛行極低。而攝影之困難。亦因以起。人皆以爲愈低愈近。愈易攝影。殊不知飛機在空中飄忽不定。其上下左右移動之速率。較任何車輛相差爲大。蓋車輛僅向前進。飛機則不然。移動速率。距物愈近而愈烈。有時適在露光之時。機身忽有升降。則全片必模糊不淸。此即稱爲斵輪老手之新聞王。亦只得詔我等多拍幾張。而無其他良法可以補救也。半小時後。三人所携之片咸告罄。乃收拾攝影器。坐而瀏覽空中景物。同時機亦飛升至三千五百尺。見所謂吳淞口者。其形適如口。蓋兩灘相夾。出此即海。恰爲天設之口岸也。白雲如烟如絮。飄行甚迅。機行其中。又疑置身於嵐霧之中。此時機之升降靡定。每升必行陡降。氣壓愈高。呼吸亦不爽。開窗則風極大。閉窗則耳如雷鳴。莫君以嚮未經此。覺頭暈胸泛作嘔。余則以曾經海舶風浪。雖覺不適。但尚能支持。惟新聞王則毫無所苦。且奔走以帕紙承穢濁。幸試飛時間已過。機亦逐漸下降。迨至落浦就岸。余及莫君咸如釋重負。身輕足健。還我本來。少飛問此行樂乎余則告以欲知飛行何狀。可於影戲院中安坐看新聞片。旣有翱翔之樂。復無暈眩之苦。倘必以身親實踐爲可貴。則大可不必耳。此行所攝咸爲稀有之片。蓋因本埠飛行。從無如此之低。事後且知更因此幾引起莫大糾紛。緣西報次日載有飛機載反動份子飛行甚低。經過租界。且在狄司威路一帶散發傳單云云。因此引起租界當局之注意。且派人往航空公司調查。嗣經王君親往證明。方始釋疑。余謂王君。此亦所謂壯舉乎。因相與大嚱。</p>
<p>海客付之一笑</p>
<p>甲—你向來是嘻嘻哈哈地很快樂的。這兩天爲甚么悶鬰鬰不樂。好像有莫大心事似的。　　乙—只爲我失去了兩個最知己的朋友了。</p>
<p>甲—這兩位知己朋友可是都死了麼。</p>
<p>乙—不是不是。只爲我借了他們的錢。一時還不出來。見不得面。</p>
<p>甲—我生平一向自信是個極誠實的人。但不知道誠實人可以打撲克麼。</p>
<p>乙—你自管做你的誠實人｛若要打撲克｛.那麼非輸不可。</p>
<p>甲—近來年輕夫婦。一言不合往往提出離婚。你以爲這種辦法對不對。</p>
<p>乙—我以為這是懦怯的表現。我却是好勇鬭很的。不贊成這種辦法。</p>
<p>甲—然而好勇鬭狠。於離婚問題有甚麼關係。</p>
<p>乙—我主張作戰到底。拼一個你死我活。　　宅主—怎麼。你又上我的門來了。上次*</p>
<p>我給了你一塊錢。你曾答應我做工去的。怎麼仍是做這伸手將軍。</p>
<p>乞人—先生。我不敢欺騙你。我在監獄中實在已做了兩個月的工作了。現在出來休息一下。</p>
<h3>誌滇中之換鼎事　　鄭逸梅</h3>
<p>滇中牟定縣、有繆理中者。坐擁資產。富名動西鄙。家藏翡翠鼎一。高尺許。純碧湛然。不瑕玷。不斑駁。瑩澤若含有水液。日光照之。通體明透。滃然又若雲氣之起騰。置於巨缸中。缸盛以水。映水俱綠。理中視爲傳家之寶。歲時宴客。輙出陳之。見莫不交口讚譽。西方鑒賞家。曾願出萬金之價。理中不忍割愛相貽焉。今春寒食節。理中染疾卒。有子三。謀析產分爨。各垂涎翡翠鼎。欲據爲己有。然鼎祇一枚。此得彼失。爭執不下。旣而伯提議捭鼎爲三。仲叔亦表贊同。謂無可以瓦全。毋寧爲玉碎。得鼎足。聊以慰情。擬於明日當眾捭之。繆家有仆頗黠詐。聞之而熟計。憶某舊貨鋪中有一赝鼎。與此相彷彿。乃出善價購歸。而私易之。翌日。果捭鼎。碎而分取。三子未之辯也。前月。伯以鼎足付玉人。磋之爲他玩好之具。玉人曰。此碔砆之類耳。非翡翠也。伯訝之。遂與仲步同究其事。傼心虛怯。即挾鼎而遁。控諸有司。已鴻飛冥冥。不知去向矣。曩昔庾子拳禍。聯軍蹂躪幾輔。大內之物。紛攫以出。某國卒二。得一舊哥窯巨碟。無可分贓。欲擊碎之。適爲某骨董商所覩。以十金易之。古物如得保全。運以來滬。居爲奇貨。此與換鼎事有相類處。因附誌之如此。</p>
<h3>奇症　　　　厂</h3>
<p>杭縣北鄉鵲來亭郭元慶先生。年屆而立。素無疾病。日前傍晚。立門前　　閒眺。忽覺心頭微癢如有無數細蟲蠕蠕而動。初尚可耐。繼而漸癢漸烈。坐臥不安。終則癢不可堪。汗流色變。拿到地亂滾。興家驚惶。急延數醫救治。奈無一識其病原。以是均束手無策。正紛擾間。一住居對面之賣糖老翁聞訊來視。翁睹狀。乃謂衆曰。如以鮮樟樹皮煎湯。飲之而無樟樹臭味者。予能治之。否則非予所知也。衆無奈。姑試之。果無樹氣。於是翁命去先生之上衣。復令覆臥榻上。然後翁屈右手中指。以指節遍擊其背。每擊四五下。即有一塊墳起。全背共起數十塊。一一以針刺之。以指擠之。則有色白質黏腥臭難聞而形似糯米飯然之細粒自塊中出。及各塊中之粘質擠出後。則心癢遂止病。竟霍然。衆皆驚喜。爭向老翁詢病名。翁答不知。但言三十年前。吾邑東陽。有村董黃正榮者。亦患同樣之奇症。徧請附近名醫治療。均不見效。嗣經一草頭醫生以上述之法治之。病乃愈。據該醫生言。此症殊危險。如治之不得其法。則二十四小時後。未有不致命者。其時予適傭於黃某家。故目覩其事。惟當時未聞該醫生言及此病之名稱及起原也。</p>
<p>右所記者。奇症也。亦險症也。特表而出之。俾世之患同樣之症者。知所救治。願閱者諸君廣爲宣傳。</p>
<h3>南洋遊記　　　（四三）　　花</h3>
<p>十二日閱報載有自殺投水者。被政府拘留而罰之。此事西律殊可怪。人生於天地無自殺之權耶。吾昔聽講法律時。云無自殺權。甚怪之。今果見西人執行此法。亦太不自由矣。章太炎曾有論及此曰。有人焉於于世無所逋負。憤世厭生。蹈清泠之淵以死。此固其人所得自主。非大羣所得詢問也。抑英政府對殖民地政策。一切用消極法。對於鴉片嫖賭一切任其自由。而且有皇家鴉片賣烟局。對於人民之消極自由也。蓋無限制。獨對自殺乃嚴制若此。亦保故與。　　香港新嘉坡。均有總督。而總督須能通閩粵語者。英外交爲海陸第一。故法之拿破崙。德之維廉。俄之種種政策。均敗於英手。至今猶保持一等之局面。不知將來印度以東民族起立後如何耳　　此問亦有虐待動物禁止之議。曾召集開會討論。而討論者爲殺牛時之如何殺法。不應凌遲致死。不過事實上常可笑。盧煒昌君語我曰。昔有警士干涉人拿鷄倒拿鷄腿。即向人腿上踢左面一脚。又踢右面一脚。其人俄然問故。則曰。爲其倒持鷄腿也。其人曰。余腿被君踢將傷矣。鷄腿尚無恙。天下事往往不揣其本。有如此者开、日本亦有虐待動物禁止之令。於各街設牛馬飲所。美國貓犬病院。至看護婦有萬八千人。然而大戰起時。屍橫遍野。虎狼食之。今中國各地。亦有放生會救魚龞龜。昔年杭州西湖。因賣魚事。友人某君專至杭。以數萬元盡買西湖之魚放之。謂修功德而余主張世界廢戰。先取消人殺之醜事者。彼並未爲余助力。不求人而救魚龞。顛倒如此。　　十三日。游工商補習學校。此校爲林則揚校長所辦。有太虛爲題署。請余爲作序。而校長以獨身主義史名。余甚敬之人。之敬出家人也。亦不過以其捨世事。守獨身寡欲耳。故獨身主義。爲至可欽敬也。余爲序補習之義。蓋欲擴大之。用Wells偉而士大同世界計劃。無人終身不須補習。亦無人終身不須指導。社會因不如此。則妨碍進化也。余考其意。即孔子學不厭。敎人不倦之義。偉而士推至世界人人能如此。云可調和智識。日進無已。以至大同也。余本此意。爲序之。希望一般人補習者多云。林校長云此間有一隙地。可辦新村。余甚望之。</p>
<h3>歐游通訊（六十二）　　　　　　　劉海粟</h3>
<p>法國秋季沙龍</p>
<p>（三）我出品的經過（下）</p>
<p>九月二十八日那一天。雖然是說秋天。還是熱悶的天氣。上午我就到公使館去取了一張八年以前所作的舊畫。因爲高曙靑公使替我帶來十張舊作。一直存在使館沒有想到拿出來。在那天晚上陳劉傅三位都來我的臥室閒談。後來又來了張弦邱世恩二位。三五人一聚集。那談鋒更感興味。他們看過以前的秋季沙龍的更談着那內容的豐富。新生命的奔騰。愈鼓起我們血潮的怒吼。傅君就在那時代我們塡寫着出口願書。我就署名HSBai因爲我的乳名叫做磐Bai　磐之譯名而已。塡好以後我一人默想秋季沙龍那樣嚴格此次我們的出品。能否入選。却沒有把握。忽然。又覺得何必多此一舉呢。這樣就不知不覺之間。將秋季沙龍的事擱起。而作別閒話談。到更深。於是就各自歸去睡了一覺。就到第二天早上。我們冒雨送畫到秋季沙龍辦公處去。那是在香遂麗遂大街的大宮裏。香遂麗遂在巴黎市上是最爲繁華之處。大宮是巴黎的一座最宏崇的歷史上有名的建筑物。正門呢。那時正在開着汽車展覽會。我們從那邊穿過叢林間。繞着噴水池走不壞池邊白石彫象的倒影。映着滴翠的綠茵。水面上若有若無的漣漪。水底幾尾漫游的紅魚。眞不壞。我們再向左轉。就望見石級立着許多人在那裏談話。進上看時正是B字門。這是秋季沙龍的辦公室處了。隨着衆人魚貫依次進去。是一個極大的廠屋。將畫件先寄存在那裏。先我們而去的人已經排立在前面的大約有十丈長。我們立在幽暗的廠房裏面等候着。一陣熱一陣煩。仿佛又進了昏沉的圈套。我正是不耐煩的歎了一口氣跟着衆人走進去時。我忽然感到一種巧妙敏銳的刺戟。一種飛驃那般的警告。一路進去在幽暗的廠屋中就看到排立着成千的石像。在兩旁用短垣相隔的室內用ABC…字母分別標起來。裏面堆積着數不清的畫幅。這大約都是先前送到的出品吧。今天還有這許多人送來。那麼眞是沒有希望了。我無形中感到驚懼。就這樣默想。等了一小時以後。走到前面一張寫字檯。點着雪亮的燈。我們就交出了願書。取了收條。我的號數已是七千六百十一號了。再走到別一張公案去付錢。每人付了七十五法郎。我終以爲這是一件徒然無用的企圖。一路向外面走看見那無數的作品的時候。常在恍恍地深深的憂慮中。出了大宮仍是細雨如烟之時。眺望所及。一片録茵。和那鳶色的叢林之間。淡然一抹顯出那拿破崙的陵墓的尖塔。眞象莫奈的畫面那樣的境界。</p>

<p>晨開尚平在關內盤旋　八月份金價初開五百九十八兩二錢計、加九錢毛盤哄至六百兩、買賣尚平、旋略見低、計九十八兩七八錢而外匯穩定、臺灣吸九月英金六便士一二五、俄而銀行對做近期英金六便士、至先令揭佈時爲六百○一兩光景、源盛志豐永、大德成等紛紛購進、兼之八月份花旗三十六元六二五銀行出入均、做、至十點零狂漲六七兩、爲六百○七兩三錢、後由福昌志豐永等賣出故已抑小三兩、至十點三刻退爲六百○四兩三錢、</p>
<p>盛傳現金運津價乃直上　匯票尚稱站定、而源盛等繼續爭購、並傳現金可運往津埠、乃價幾有飛舞色彩、扶搖上升四五兩、惟十一點前後稍有二兩餘起仆、九月份英金三井等仍然賣出六便士○六二五、至十一點半已跳至六百○九兩三錢、復以福興永售出、遂遜去三兩、午時爲六兩二三錢、迨正午收盤爲六百○七兩五錢、比較前日計加漲十兩二錢、</p>

<h3>外匯稍轉緊俏</h3>
<p>但不若金市暴騰</p>
<p>套頭似漸見接近</p>
<p>華商扒進抵前空</p>
<p>洋商亦有結欵訊</p>
<p>昨週六、外匯向例上午半天、匯豐掛牌仍未更動、而銀市亦無榮辱、至於銀行內盤英美日三匯均稍緊俏、但不若金價之高峯、乃標金之騰漲、遠過於匯票矣、故套頭勢已接近也、大約四五十兩華商投機家及印度帮曾向扒進、以抵前空、而洋商亦有結數消息故人氣堅挺也、於是金價將高至六百五十兩焉、計英金成交廿餘萬鎊、絕約結進十餘萬鎊、由住多三井安達等售出、亦有售出少數、乃臺灣納進各行互相成交數萬鎊又對做美金十萬元、而日金僅由金業中售與三井正金中興等數十萬元、又中行售出一二十萬元、迨午刻收市比諸隔昨計英金縮一二五、美金縮三一二五、日金縮一分二五、市况似趨上峯也、</p>
<p>英匯內盤僅以零六二五上落、掉期仍爲零六二五、早市七月出價一先令六便士、八月六便士零六二五、九月一二五、十月一八七五、買價照加零六二五、台灣進九月五千鎊、價六便士一二五運通與美豐·三井與麥加利、對做七月二萬、價六便士、住友三井安達等賣出九月二三萬开價六便士零六二五、浙江上海對做十月一萬、價六便士一八七五、午收七月出價五便士九三七五、八月六便士、九月六便士零六二五、十月一二五、進價仍加零六二五、</p>

<p>東匯　內盤祇以半分起仆掉期每個月二五、而近期較緊、自午市七月出價一兩三錢五分五八月一兩三錢五分二五、九月兩三錢五分、十月一兩三錢四分七五、買價照减半分、三井於早初進現大連五萬元價一兩三錢四分三七五、中行出八月五萬元、一兩三錢五分、又與中興對做十萬元、同價、午收七月出賣一兩三錢六分、八月一兩三錢五分七五九月兩三錢五分五十月兩三錢五分二五買價　小半分下午乏云、</p>
<h3>洋厘上漲勿替</h3>
<p>市場槪況昨晨洋交易買賣形勢依然盤緊、對於價格之競爭、亦殊激烈、人心方面、以買氣旣盛、頓時亦轉俏利狀態、不過銀根基礎甚鬆、亦爲厘價轉昂之主因、至於正式銷胃、雖仍源源不絕、究已不逮嚋昔之多矣、</p>
<p>厘拆價格「洋厘」早市形勢又較前日秀　、結果收盤價爲七錢二分半、較前日早市又好一厘、午市交易疏淡、競爭亦懈、遂與早市同價、銀拆俞趨愈鬆、早市祇開七分、午市更低、僅做四分劃頭始終白劃掛牌亦無行市、</p>
<p>輔幣市情江南小洋、日形低墮、早市爲六錢二分六厘半、午市爲六錢二分四厘、結果兩市又小二厘半、做出交易、僅早市三千角、午市行情雖跌小、而仍無人買賣、廣東小洋亦覺下游、早市爲六錢○七厘、午市爲六錢○五厘、做出交易、早市十二萬五千角、午市七萬角、銅元回長二千文、爲三百九十二千文、</p>
<p>銀洋進出「銀欵」昨以星期六、銀行收解例稀、華商收解票欵一百五十餘萬、外商亦一百五六十萬、各種貨匯稅雜諸欵收解七百萬光景、、出倉九十萬、日商銀行收解各欵二百四五十萬、進倉三十萬、錢莊銀公單收解以比期關係、似乎略多、計有四千二百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百十餘萬、各路匯欵收解七十餘萬、收現六七十萬、「洋欵」匯劃票欵、早市做出一百三十五萬五千、午市僅五十一萬五千、鈔票早市無交易午市做出一萬二千、場外鈔票、早市十二萬三千、午市七萬現洋早市十五萬、午市八萬、银行買賣、早市*</p>

<h3>大條不動美銀無市</h3>
<p>昨據倫敦電訊、大條銀近遠期均無伸縮、計近期仍爲十五辨士六二五、（合英鎊爲一先令六辨士半、）遠期計十五辨士半、脚地無特別變化、市面呆滯又紐約電訊、美銀價及美對英日等因花旗節期停工、英對美降一二五、爲四元八角六分二四三七五、日英仍爲二先令○四三七五、英滬先令加長零六二五、爲一先令六辨士三七五、又本日午市十一點四十五分路透電來、日美仍爲四十九元三七五、日英加零三一二五、計二先令○三七五、惟電通社來、槪無升降、</p>
<h3>證券債市下降甚烈</h3>
<p>跌一元至三元</p>
<p>昨日公債現貨、僅編遣、關稅、裁兵三種開出、其他均無交易、期市上午平靜、下午以債價下降益勁、市况遂轉熱鬧、查債價之變動情形、因時局關係、人心虛弱異常、賣氣暢旺、而買方相形見拙、前市沉靜、續跌甚勁、早午市前後兩盤、仍步步下降、下午雖不寂寞、跌勢未衰、裁兵幾跌而停拍、收盤始稍轉平、結果裁兵七月期跌三元零五分、八月亦跌二元七角、其他各跌一元至一元六七角不等、惟九六僅略小數角、跌勢之烈、近所稀見也、</p>

<p>棉紗實銷尚暢、粵帮採辦仍健、惟川帮購買較鮮、本埠市勢仍疲實以底貨尚厚海外花紗市况仍在疲軟中、故一部份雖有辦意然各廠均有充足的現紗供給、因之市盤未能上漲、商場上多數買方、因秋季時期接近、查去年七八九三個月有劇烈之漲風、故購進做多者頗衆、然去年此際海外紗市大涨、三品紗價在二百五六十元、國內底貨薄弱、尚有印度商組織收買、遂有此猛漲之勢云</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市平定</h3>
<p>閘斛已照常評價</p>
<p>閘北昨日北粳評斛已慟、價仍以二十一元爲最高餘下次貨按品批降、斛數有一千餘石之譜刻下源仍斷、粳薄存貨即將斛竣、秈米沉寂、變元微有成交、緣走銷平淡、到貨凋零、價無榮辱、</p>
<p>滬南河下來源不足十號、本街進胃尚可、蘇同機粳大盤高爲二十一元、次至二十元、情勢平穩、南帮航船薄稻有零星到埠、成本較重因裏路產價近亦報昂、故盤面亦在限價之列也、洋杜尖貨稀見定、以洋米鄉莊零拆大多向津、通變吊飯兩胃進意均滯、近日貨客均抱隨到隨售之意市况因覺微弱、客元稍有抵埠、去化不爽、行情十八元半左右、</p>
<h3>中關洋米突跌半元</h3>
<p>昨日洋米突見變化、因開市後謠傳車路被土匪所擾、內地帮辦胃隨即停頓、其他各客帮因近日收到拋貨、胃口吃足、有意趁此機會觀望不動、以待其小、本街亦以貨足停頓、統市祇糙米尚有本街內地略辦、白秈除平糶外、槪無去路、市面立見不　　　　米有到　　　　　　比前日跌小半元、各色糙米均小二三角、西貢一二號各小角半、全日開出各秈八千包、糙米四千包云、</p>
<h3>期粉狂跳四五分</h3>
<p>軍糧需要驛增之故</p>
<p>昨日粉市、又發生極大之波瀾以目下暴落暴漲彷彿純受政局所支配、前日因海關禁止出口、預料銷場將受打擊、致人心搖動、市面遂告墮落至昨日開價時、本月份承前日之餘風、低至二兩四八分半自此之後、一帆風順步步扶搖直上、其衝動之猛烈、殊出一般人意料之外、因麵粉雖禁止直裝天津、但南京及長江一帶、或屬軍糧、或屬米行昂騰之故、需要驟增、而市場空氣所能籠罩者、又謠傳長江之輪泊、聞因軍用關係、小麥之到頭、將告中斷、粉銷旣能接替、原料又不能暢到、因此人心遂復受激動、開價步入昂俏此種局面、以事態復雜、後步伊於何底殊難逆料也、結果自未月份至九月份各較前日回漲四分二厘半、十月份漲四分、十一月份漲五分二釐半、十二月份漲四分半云、</p>
<h3>麥市受流言衝動</h3>
<p>恐來源受阻…提高四五分</p>
<p>昨日期麥上午曾見虛軟、十月份最低四兩八錢一分、八月份四兩九錢三分、九月份五兩零四分、惟以後各盤、則又逐步回升、因傳小麥來源、暫時須受阻隔、傳滬寧路奔牛叚被匪掘毀、長江船聞被扣留三十餘艘謠言一盛、人心遂節節上升也、下午各盤人心已堅勁不少、但廠方向不願故抬、因此漲勢尚不甚巨、結果本月份較前月大一分、八月份小四分、九月份大五分、十月份大五分、十一月份大三分、十二月份大二分、現麥中次喊價仍平、高貨因存碼不豐、又喊高三四分不等、聞漢口揚州通州雙鳳蓬萊崑山徐州麥共開四千六百餘元云、</p>
<p>絲茶歐美絲銷仍難進展</p>

<h3>浙屬夏繭相繼结束</h3>

<p>浙省各屬、今歲夏繭均告歉收、各繭行先後開秤、收繭多者兩星期、少者七八日、收額類均有限、現均相繼結束、新收之乾繭、現因各局缺乏貨車、援照春繭辦法、改由水陸並運、故各屬新夏繭現已紛裝舟分途運滬云、</p>
<h3>珍眉綠茶歐銷仍滯</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶大勢仍無重大進展、貢熙綠茶、因俄莊開辦期近、雖呈活躍景象、然最重要之珍眉綠茶、存積已達二萬餘箱、英法行家、除對於高莊抽芯貨、略有進胃外、其餘均不談盤、針眉·秀眉等項、日來略有零星交易、但售價甚低茶市前途、頗難認爲樂觀云、</p>

<p>藝術界</p>
<h3>文藝與民族意識　　應鵬</h3>
<p>二　　現在中國思想界中、忘記了有自己的民族、其責任在敎育方面、中國敎育上的中心目標、始終沒有樹立、這在學校通用的敎材上就可以看出、結果在新文藝上、便充分顯出這種病態的傳佈、</p>
<p>近兩年來新文藝失却了中心意識、以致彷徨在岐途中的作者、感覺到苦悶和無聊、一方面形成頹廢思想、使靑年整個的精神、沉醉在逸樂的夜生活裏、一方面提出了普羅的口號、其目的却不過想在生活上得到經濟的解决、</p>
<p>我們並不是反對享樂、但享樂是努力的結果和奮鬥的報酬、中華民族現在是度着「苦難的時代」、「苦難時代」唯一的出路、是要自己努力、衝破這種危險的環境、必須等到物質上的建設有了相當的成績以後、才可以談到享樂、否則惟有沒落、新式的頹加蕩生活與舊式的山林隱逸生活、是一般的心理、</p>
<p>「怒吼呀、中國、」這句話、如果我們的「民族意識」極端強烈的時候、便絕對不應該允許別人來代替我們來喊、否則便表示了我們的沒出息、這是極可羞恥之事、一種民族的奮鬥、只能夠靠着自己的一羣的力量去克服一切困難、决不能希望他人來替自己努力、不幸所謂新興文學家的態度、以及他們所描寫的一切、都是沈湎在希望人家來替自己求出路的噩夢里、這種心理、尤其使我們爲中華民族寒心</p>
<p>文藝上的非戰運動、現在有人在主張着、戰爭至少在現代是絕對不可避免之事、「化干戈爲玉帛、」不過是一個白日之夢而已、講到戰爭、不能說一定是罪惡的、可以咀咒的、如果爲民族求出路而戰的話、那末戰爭也未始不可以歌頌、並且、就現在的中國情形而論、似乎我們還沒有「非戰」的資格、</p>

<h3>文壇雜話</h3>
<p>拜倫的脚　　　　　平</p>
<p>誰都知道的拜倫的、母親是個很性急的人、而父親是放蕩無賴的貴族喜歡在外面瞎跑和亂嬲姘頭、</p>
<p>拜倫的性情、多少要受一點父母的遺傳、而他的天才也祇少大部份是根據這樣的性情、</p>
<p>他出於英國的名門、他所有貴族的容貌、已很足以誇耀詩人的感情、不過他是個蹺脚、這是他一生的最大恨事、</p>
<p>這、在他從孩子時代起、就以爲是一件最痛苦的事、</p>
<p>他的所以蹺脚、相傳有二個說法、一個說是先天的、另一個則以爲他母親的亂暴而跌傷了的、但至今大家還不知道究竟那一說是對的、</p>
<p>他的那雙涼爽的詩人眼睛、黃金的頭髪、純白皮膚、尤其是他的高朗響亮的聲音、誰都聽了要發生快感的、所以在大學讀書時、大家都叫他「美音神士」、他旣有這許多可以讚美的處所、而不幸是個蹺脚、也無怪他以爲是一生最大的恨事了、</p>
<p>小時候在馬路上走、就常有人在後面叫着、</p>
<p>「呀、美麗的孩子、但可惜是個蹺脚」　　生於多感性質的他、和患有強烈的「歇斯的利」的母親、當然是合不來的、母親每在發怒時、總將手頭的東西向他亂投、孩子時的他、對母親的這種野蠻行爲、總從未懷恨過、容易發怒的母親、也終未想以對孩子應該施以怎樣的感情、　　「呆子、你難道不知道自己是蹺脚麼、」</p>
<p>他從母親那裏聽到這樣的罵聲時、就再也不能忍耐、而滿流着眼淚的回答说、</p>
<p>「但是、母親、你爲什么這樣生我的呢、」</p>
<p>這是多么沉痛的一句答話呀、　　有一次、他因爲和母親相罵得太利害、曾經用一把小刀來自殺過的、　　這樣、我們可以知道他的後的火炎似的性質、都由多感的孩子時代養成的、</p>
<h3>哈代的傳記出版</h3>
<p>我們這位大詩人哈代的傳記、本來有一本叫做「哈代的早年生活」的在、前年出版、而現在又出了一本呌做「哈代的晚歲生涯」的這當然是繼續上一本的、凡於熱烈地崇拜着哈翁的人、這本書在他們之中自受很大的歡迎、而在一班普通人、則是感不到什么興趣的、這裏面所紀載的事件太瑣細了、舉凡哈翁每日的行踪、他所會唔的人物、他什么時候執筆作書、他日常所見所聞的感想、都一一地記載了上去、這些對哈翁自己的意義、我們是可以從他的作品看出來的、可是、這本書却也有牠的好處、牠是可以使得我們明瞭哈翁的一切、了解他那個安適而幸運的生活以及他觀察生活爲一種悲劇底熱烈中間的衝突、抑且珷這本書中又含有哈翁的幾張極珍貴的像片、是爲外間所輕易不會見到的、（梅筠）</p>

<p>托爾斯泰雖是排斥一切迷信、但二十八這個數字、總覺得與自己有很深的關係而受着的、（平）</p>

<p>交大的游泳表演</p>
<p>徐家匯交通大學舉行本届畢業禮的一天、同時在日間有許多的體育表演助興在各種表演中我以爲游泳最有意思、因爲在夏天赤日施威之下做什麼運動都是不甚自然跑跑跳跳就令你一身臭汗不久疲倦就跟汗一齊來、漸漸地就沒有精神了、那有精美的表演呢、可是游泳就不同了在炎熱的空氣下我們跑入清涼的水世界裏、眞是越玩越精神不獨在表演的人沒有汗出即是在池旁參觀的羣衆也感覺得心曠神怡、無怪他（她）們百看不厭呢、</p>
<p>看啊、徐堯堂越游越精神四百碼也來、百碼蛙時式也來百碼背泳也來、花式跳水也來、成績雖不見得好、這正是他一種偉大的精神體育指導陳君跑來跑去、點名呀、搬凳呀、眞是忙煞臨時請著一位李飛雲君發令兼報告、李君報告南北話混合而成的音調、眞是滑稽、令人笑煞、</p>

<h3>羅素的「婚姻革命」是唯</h3>
<p>心的嗎　　　　源源</p>
<p>前天楊杏佛先生在靑年會演講性問題、得參末座、領敎殊多、不過對於他所說羅素婚姻革命的立場是唯心的一句話、不無懷疑、以下是楊先生的話、「現在美國學者林賽和英國羅素都各有補救辦法、林賽的方法是男女結婚後、經濟各自獨立且同居與否、均無不可、第二種辦法—羅素的辦法—就是、可離婚、但沒有經濟的關係、不像中國的女子、一旦下堂求去、總要敲一筆竹槓、一開口就是幾萬幾千、收入很好、第一種辦法把經濟的恐慌拿掉、這樣的結合很是純潔、而且易於持久、眞是一對終身的朋友、不過這種辦法在中國是不可能、因爲中國的女子經濟多不能獨立、至於羅素的辦法對於經濟問題關係雖很少、但對於男女道德問題關係却很大、…他所提倡的是愛而不是恨和妬忌、是聽各人的自由而不是獨占、林賽主張唯物史觀、羅不經主張唯心史觀、」</p>
<p>我們實在不知道楊先生的話是何所根據�</p>
<p>而云然、難道羅素「所提倡的是愛而不是恨和妬忌」、就是他的根據唯心史觀嗎、倘使這就是唯心史觀的根基、那末、林賽的立場也可以說是唯心史觀因爲在林賽所主張的性關係中、未始沒有愛的存在、</p>
<p>其實、與其說羅素婚姻革命的立場是唯心的、那還不如說是「唯生」的好、凡是唸過婚姻革命的人都知道、照羅素看來、婚姻唯一的理由是人種問題、還有、羅素是很反對「唯心」的、他說、一旦夫婦有了孩子、那末他們—假使他們是有責任心和愛護後裔之心—必定要感覺得那最重要的不再是他們兩個人中間的感情」、總之、他所注意的是人種而不是楊先生所說「看不見、找不到、仿佛沒有這樣的東西」的綣繾之情—或戀愛、因此、他在「婚姻革命」第六章裏便不遣餘力地向浪漫的愛大施其攻擊了、</p>
<p>照我看來、羅素「婚姻革命」的價値就是在離開「唯心」而專致力於「唯生」、羅素是一個社會改良者、其注重於「唯生」也宜矣、所以把羅素多作一個「唯心」論者那真是冤枉透了、爲此與楊先生商榷、</p>

<h3>快報介紹</h3>
<p>「農村經濟」　　　　　　謝曼</p>
<p>河田嗣郎著　陳大同陸善熾合譯</p>
<p>我國自稱以農立國、然而中國的農業究竟是怎樣的一幕、</p>
<p>我們雖然不能武斷的說中國農業已經破產、但至少、我們可以說一句良心話—是腐敗、這是無論從主觀或客觀的觀點上看都是不可掩飾的、事實是如此充分的明顯的呈現着　　占我中國人口有分之八十以上、終歲勤勞、而啼饑號寒者、厥爲農民、胼手胝足、固不足以供士豪劣紳土匪流氓之剝削、而東西各國又利用其科學萬能以增進生產、珷更置我國農民於死地、　　解除民衆痛苦的口號、近年在表面上宣揚的成績不算壞、但是用何法去實地的解除、終無具體辦法、在已往、雖是做不少的農民的運動、可是在學理上既缺乏研究會書籍、在實際上尤少調查的統計、便是要想去研究、調查也是往往苦於沒有下手的標準、</p>
<p>本書的著者河田嗣郎是日本經濟學名敎授、我們也可以承認他是日本的社會經濟學家、書中不特於學理上有明確的研究、即各項實施的調查統計、蔓羅得也非常明晰、</p>
<p>本書其分三篇、第一篇可算是對於經濟所下的解釋、分述經濟的表現、經濟和經濟的行爲、經濟行爲和經濟機關、經濟機關和經濟組織、經濟組織和資本主義經濟、經濟學裹不可區分的兩重事實、「經濟」的起源、以及唯物史觀和社會的變革、第二篇是正式的對於農村經濟之探究、詳述都市與農村的對立珷工商業的榕取、農村的收支狀態（包含各農家之資產、各農家的資產之估價、自耕農之收支、自耕兼佃農的收支表、佃農之收支、）工商業和農業的比較、米作農業之經濟（佃戶之計算及各府縣之調查、農家經濟調查之困難—日本全國米作之平均收穫、作爲直接生產費支出之資本、間接作爲生產費負擔之資本、米作收支計算表、）農村之金融、農村之財政、第三篇探討農村經濟的各種問題、依據事實上研究（和發現）經濟學之變遷和農村經濟問題之關聯、在佃租問題裏、探究佃農的生產分配、佃租問題和勞動工資的問題、從勞動工資計算的租種收獲物的分配問題、從地主的立場上討論田租、金融機關和佃租問題的關聯、佃租問題和法律問題的維繫、在農村經濟和政治關係的立論裏闡明了佃租問題和政治的連繫、議員的選舉和政治上的各種問題、危險的思想和社會的改造、在農村經濟問題和金融的關係裏、更解釋了人類這活動和資本的運用、金融機關的任務、以及從來金融界對於家村之影響…等、</p>
<p>據我所知、此書之產生是爲了日本的農村經濟已接近一種莫大的危機而產生的、此書在日本的危機將臨的情形之下、有他的供獻、有他的力量、有他的意義、有他的價値、有他的地位、在日本的農村社會裏、此書自然有出世的必要、</p>
<p>據我所知、此書在日本、曾在農村金融幾乎將近破產的慘態之下受著一般農村的歡迎、並予以農村以很大的援助、　　在我們中國、農村經濟的狀態和日本相比較雖是性質不同、形式不同、背景不同、而農村經濟上所感受的痛苦與打擊則距離不遠、</p>
<p>我以爲以書在中國農村經濟問題成爲唯一的急切的問題情况之下、它至少能幫忙我國農運的進展开我以爲、它至少能提醒我國急迫的農運上的路綫、</p>
<h3>多情的寡婦　　　　　　問鵑</h3>
<p>奧國顯尼志勞著　施蟄存譯</p>
<p>人們都知道顯尼志勞是一個醫生、所以他的小說、最擅長於心理的描寫、對的在這本多情的寡婦裏邊珷可以說十分之九、是極深刻的心理的分析、內容大概是這樣的、</p>
<p>主人公蓓爾達、是一個神經質的女子、她好音樂、曾經有過成爲青年藝術家的企圖但是被境過的手掌生、拖開了她、使她不得不放棄了未來的幸福生活的描畫、並且還拋離了一個青年提琴家的戀愛、終於跌入了庸人的懷裏、作了三年盲目的夫妻生活、此後她便守寡了、她的天性、使她愿意做一個端正的婦人、和一個孩子的好母親、可是、她那未曾得到過寄托的心靈、終於擾亂了她、使她不得不陷入幻想和煩悶的境界中、光明居然來到了、她從一張新聞紙上珷發現了十二年前的戀愛者提琴家愛米兒的肖像、煩亂立刻侵襲了她、往事的追憶在她心裏升起來了、</p>
<p>「她不禁想起有一天晚上、在音樂院課畢後、她和愛米兒在城裏園裏散步、那一次他曾在她身旁坐下來休息、他曾用溫柔的手指撫摸著她的面頰、這種事情祇有過一次嗎、不常常有的、他們曾在那位子上同坐過一二十次珷他曾撫摸過她的面頰、此時這種種事情都回到她底思想裏來、眞是何等的奇怪」、　　當她第一次重到維也納去的時候、曾經意識地在公園中找尋從前和愛米兒一同散步過的地方、這一段描寫心理、是很值得我們一讀的、　　「她心中惱着這種煩亂、懷想着、在昔年妙齡的時候她曾驕矜地無關心地在這些園路上閒行、她覺得自從那時候到現在、她已經衰落了許多、變得這樣地可憐了、她底想坐到那音樂會前排座位上去的思想、顯見得是很僭妄的、幾乎是不可行的、所以如此想來要愛米兒、林赫巴特還認識她也似乎是絕對不可能的事、眞的、要使他還記得有她這個人存在、在她看來也幾乎是不能的了…似乎他愈是飛得遠、愈是可仰而不可攀、她便自己愈感覺到悲哀、一時間似科覺和她當初放棄了情人、拋掉了要過藝術家生活的希望、而自去混在庸人中過一種暗無天日的生涯、這眞是全然不可解的、」　　不知是一種什麼力氣幫助她、竟然在維也納回來以後、毅然給他寫了一封信去、事情進行得很是順利珷不久她們便會面了、她是怎樣地痴情、怎樣地對他傾心、怎樣地希望他向她求愛、而建立起她們的永續而專一的愛情珷然而愛米兒却說、</p>
<p>「我想我們還是讓她不解决的好、」　　她的輕微的失望不能阻止她對他的熱情、終於在愛米兒臂間失去了素日的莊嚴性格、她成了他的情婦了、　　實在、她的痴情、並不會得到相當的酬報、愛米兒的願望、只是剎那間的歡愛、他拒絕了她到他家中拜訪的請求、並且冷酷地打退了她搬到維也納去住居的希望珷使這位多情的寡婦感到莫大的悲哀與悔恨、而這本書也就收場了、　　作者對於人生的態度、是很悲觀的、在這冊多情的寡婦當中珷把愛情也寫得異常悲慘、他假設了露比烏斯夫婦、影射着蓓爾達及其已死的丈夫、露比烏斯夫人是被驅失身而死、留下一個無父的小孩、給自己的癱廢的丈夫去撫養、他還恐怕讀者不明白他的用意、特地在蓓爾達訪問——或者可以說是送終——露比烏斯夫人病榻的時候、寫著這樣的幾句、　　「她心想如她忽然地死了、愛米兒將說些什么話呢、啊、這是一定會使他覺得有些悲哀的、如果他能夠想到她、幾天前他曾抱在　臂裏的、現在睡在墳墓裏腐爛了…現在究竟誰在壞的形勢裏</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>[H中華民國十九年七&gt;</p>
<p>這個注定著就要死亡的婦人嗎、還是蓓爾達她自己、」　　露比烏斯就是蓓爾達的化身、在此是甚爲明顯的了、　　書中的情調、自始至終都是黯淡和沉悶的、他把蓓爾達的灰色生活、襯托着她的矛盾而散亂的心境、在每一個字裹邊、都充滿着人生的悲慘、讀完了這本書的人、總要嘆一口氣說、「愛情原來是這樣的、一個癡情的女子所追求而得到的、往往出不了和這個女主人公同樣的命運、不但浪漫的藝術家是這樣、或者這正是男子們的愛情的公例吧、」　　作者似乎用全力描寫着女主人公蓓樂達、關於愛米兒却寫得很飄忽、大概這樣一個飄忽的藝術家、就是人間的愛情的象徵吧、愛情本來只是一種幻象、到了某一個時期、這幻象是必然要消逝的、作者這種銳利的觀察、確乎是看透了人生以後、才有這種類乎極端悲觀的寫法、　　書中開首出現的克林格曼先生、可以說是愛米兒內心生活的寫照、蓓爾達能夠拒絕克氏的誘引、却不能接受愛米兒的熱情的迷醉、這也是多情的女人全體的悲哀、不止蓓爾達一個、作者却巧妙地使他們復光輝遇著、成爲一種有趣的對照、</p>
<p>這本譯作共二百九十四頁、約十萬餘字、譯筆也很細緻、是最近譯述界中比較使人滿意的出版物、</p>
<h3>世界文學的故事（一）（七）（六）</h3>
<p>美國約翰瑪西著</p>
<p>第四十六章斯干的那維亞文學　　　　胡仲持譯　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　胡仲持譯</p>
<p>在這時代、即在十九世紀初葉、有過許多眞正卓越的抒情詩人和散文作家、聞名最廣的散文作家及詩人是腓特烈加布累麥、她的小說『日常生活的素描』『H家』『鄰人』『會長的女兒』等等、捉住了她的國人的心、經由瑪麗豪易特的優美的翻譯、還遍及於使用英語的世界、那些小說是感傷底、那感傷性可並不是惹厭的、她同喬治桑一樣誠實、但在有趣這一點却差得多、她是婦人解放的有力的宣傳者、但幸而那優美的狂熱還沒有傷損她的故事、</p>
<p>布累麥姑娘是芬蘭人、在同世紀中葉的第一個瑞典詩人魯涅堡、倘不從血統、却從誕生地說來、也是芬蘭人、他最多寫到的是芬蘭的主材、而且在芬蘭度</p>
<p>了他的生活的大部分、他博得了非常的聲望、本是芬蘭的小小的大學的無名的敎員的他是成了在近代瑞典詩之中、僅次於滕內耳、而在滕內耳死後居第一位的瑞典的煊赫的桂冠詩人的、他的抒情詩最有英譯本的、</p>
<p>同世紀的中葉之際、瑞典的散文缺少生命珷是龔底、和挪威及丹麥比較起來、瑞典是落後的、至同世紀的末葉、由於法蘭西的寫實主義、以伊孛生爲代表的挪威的劇、及以白蘭德司爲代表的丹麥的批評的影響、一種學藝復興期生出了、新文學中最醒目的人物是有莫大的力的怪僻的天才史特林堡、據流傳的故事云伊孛生望著中特林堡的肖像、曾說道、「這是要比我更傑出的人物呀」、伊孛生和史特林堡在其人生觀全不相同、在伊孛生的最美妙的戲曲中、婦人有著獨立底精神、從使沒有使解放實現、她總是努力求解放的、反之、史特林堡是猛烈地反對解放運動的婦人憎惡者、在描着貧困而奮鬥着的美術家和作者的生活的他那最後的小說「紅房間」中、招致男子的破滅者總是女子、他的「結婚生活」。這一部短篇小說集極仔細地攻擊着女子和結婚、竟致失掉作爲藝術的那效果了、史特林堡的作品是很不平勻的、在其最低處則粗糙未熟、其最高處、則到達最高的詩底美、有一個特色貫串於其全體、就是那毫無顧忌的誠實、那觀看物的眞相、而毫無恐懼地記錄下來的意志、</p>
<p>和史特林堡成特民的對照者是瑞典作家中最卓著的婦人塞爾馬拉革勒夫、她有着柔婉的同情底空想、那使她有名而她到底沒有超越的書是」哥斯太·培爾林的古史」、於孩子—且於成人—愉快的書是「尼爾斯的奇異的旅行」、這會使韓思克里思先、安徒生喜歡的罷、這是敘述着乘於野鵝背上、飛越瑞典的少年的冒險的、塞爾馬拉革勒夫成了世界底人物了、她的書已經被譯爲許多的國語、那大部分被譯爲英語了、她在國內非常地受讚美受尊敬乃是在瑞典學士院獲選的唯一的婦人、還有一個著名的女人、就是與其說是藝術家毋寧說是哲學者及批評家、在近代瑞典的文學上佔着極重要的地位的愛倫凱、她的「戀愛和結婚」及「兒童的世紀」是關於性及敎育的問題的貴重的貢獻、</p>
<p>瑞典的最有名的作家是和史特林堡直接對立的理想主義者惠爾來爾望哈伊覃思太謨、他是屬於第一級的抒情詩人、卓越的批評家、在他那散文的羅曼斯、「安地彌盎」及「韓思·阿利那思」中、他顯示着寫實主義的虛妄、在這里奏一下羅曼斯和理想主義的調兒而離去斯干的那維亞諸國、是合宜的、</p>

When the Central Army launched a fierce attack on the left flank, it was anticipated that the enemy would take the opportunity to attack our right flank in an attempt to contain us. Therefore, when Shi launched a counterattack, our army feigned a retreat to lure the enemy deep into the encirclement and annihilate them, resulting in a complete victory (5th dispatch).</p>

<h3>Northern Party Affairs Negotiations</h3>
<p>Compromises Reached in the Dispute Over Party Leadership</p>
<p>Details of the Meeting Kept Secret</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaogu straightened out party affairs at home last night. Today, Ru Lin told people that he strongly advocated supporting Yan Xishan as chairman of the National Government because the party affairs could be decided yesterday and today, and the government would inevitably be produced as a result. He planned to go to Taiyuan again to assist in the effort. Fu is currently the deputy director of the Political Training Department (5th dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, Chen Gongbo and others telegraphed Wang Jingwei regarding the details of the party affairs meeting between Huang Shaogu, Zhao Bulian, and others at Huang Shaogu's home yesterday, as well as the general outline of the joint declaration (5th dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zou Xie told people that the formation of a government cannot be delayed, and that we have made concessions to the reorganization faction, and they have also made concessions, not discussing party orthodoxy. This was the result of yesterday's meeting and was also prompted by the military representatives. As for the details of yesterday's meeting, fearing that the youth party members would demand perfection, we agreed with Gongbo and others to temporarily not publish them, please forgive me. What I can tell you is that the draft of the declaration takes the form of a merger between Shanghai and Guangdong, and the enlarged meeting is dominated by representatives of powerful factions and those who have served on the party committee (5th dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Zhen told reporters that the party affairs negotiations had made definite progress yesterday, and that negotiations would continue today. Fu Rulin said that there had been no negotiations yesterday and that there were no preparations to continue the discussion today. He also told a reporter that we cannot tell the press the truth about party affairs, because everything will be published. The reporter group expressed dissatisfaction, saying that those who lead party affairs should tell the truth, and if they lie, we will be disappointed. Later, Qin Tao mediated and asked to forgive Fu for being hasty. Another party member said that regarding the joint declaration of the merger yesterday, youth party members at all levels asked Chen Gongbo to be careful in his wording and not to damage their position, and asked him to telegraph Wang for verification before proceeding, because Wang is the leader welcomed by the North, and powerful parties will not oppose telegraphing Wang for verification. This is the demand for party unity (5th dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person promoting party affairs suggested sending a representative to Shenyang to ask Zhang Xueliang for his consent, and this place will include Zhang's name in the list of enlarged meetings. The original list already includes thirty-one people, including Fan Zhongxiu. Now we need to add one more person (5th dispatch).</p>

<h3>Collection of Military Reports from Various Regions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Military News: (1) Wang Zhen's rebel troops, seeing our army's successive victories, did not dare to resist and intended to flee. On the 26th of last month, they secretly retreated from Yanling to the vicinity of Zhongqiao, where they were blocked and defeated by Feng's troops, suffering many casualties. (2) Liu Guitang's rebel troops in Lifangkou extort and blackmail, rape and plunder, and the people hate them to the core. Currently, the masses are contacting their respective self-defense groups and Red Spears Society to resolve this rebel troop. (3) Recently, our army's right flank on the Longhai Railway has won successive victories, killing a false division commander Zhang Yinxiang and a false brigade commander, as well as four regimental commanders and over thirty battalion commanders and lower-ranking officers. Over 1,800 soldiers were killed or wounded, and over 5,000 rifles, over 30 water-cooled machine guns, over 70 hand-held guns, 12 trench mortars, over 200 broadswords, over 400 long spears, over 6,000 officers and soldiers of Shi Yousan's rebel troops, over 300 horses, and much baggage were captured. (4) According to a captured company commander, Shi Yousan's troops have suffered terrible defeats in the past few days, their elite forces have been almost completely lost, and coupled with the lack of pay and ammunition, they are on the verge of complete disintegration. (5) After suffering terrible defeats at Huilong Temple, Danzishan, and Maotongqiao, the remnants of Zhang Gui fled to Qiyang and Baishui in disarray. Zhang's rebels, numbering a thousand, were in a terrible state. After our army continued to pursue them closely, the enemy troops competed to cross the Yongzhou River, resulting in mutual killings, capsized boats, and drowning. Much baggage and military supplies were abandoned on the riverbank, and those who failed to escape were captured by our army, including over a hundred horses, several hundred rifles, and hundreds of officers and soldiers. It is said that the rebels plan to flee back to the Huangsha River in Guizhou province, and our army is encircling them. (6) According to reports, Zhang Weixi, Tian Jinkai, and Shi Zhenqing, with no less than six divisions, began to attack our entire line at dusk on the 2nd, using all their field artillery, heavy mortars, and armored trains to concentrate their attacks on our positions at Luohe, Qinglongtan, Yancheng, Shiwulidian, Xindian, and Zhubu, followed by infantry who used the night to cross the river in different directions. Xu Yuanquan's entire army was well-prepared, so they remained calm. The guards in each position initially concealed themselves and did not fire a single shot. When the enemy crossed the river halfway, our frontline guards suddenly launched a fierce barrage of gunfire and artillery at the enemy in the river and on the opposite bank, killing and wounding them. In about an hour, corpses filled the Sha River, almost stopping its flow. Only a small group of the enemy was able to reach the shore, and they were surrounded and disarmed by our pre-arranged reserve troops. By Shenshi on the 3rd, the area had been cleared. On the night of the 3rd and the morning of the 4th, the enemy repeatedly attempted to cross the river at Yancheng, Shiwulidian, and Zhangxindian, but were repelled and killed by our guards. In the past few days, the enemy has suffered about 4,000 casualties, with 1,800 prisoners captured and over 1,000 rifles, 15 machine guns, and 12 mortars seized. The enemy's morale has been greatly reduced, and our army is currently pursuing them in victory (5th dispatch).</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Japanese Seiyukai Party's Tax Reduction Agreement</h3>
<p>Generally, political parties that have lost power and are in the opposition must establish policies beneficial to the people in order to win popular sympathy and regain their power. Therefore, the people often benefit when their political party loses power. This is common to all countries. The Japanese Seiyukai party, now in opposition, has taken the initiative to agree to a tax reduction, just as the current Japanese government, when it was in the opposition, had policies such as lifting the gold embargo and reducing government spending in order to win popular sympathy. However, once a political party gains power, although it may implement one or two of the policies it has established, the dissatisfaction of the people will inevitably arise due to the circumstances. Other parties in the opposition will take advantage of this and establish one or two policies that are sufficient to embarrass the government and win popular sympathy in order to gain power. This cycle repeats itself, and although the political parties may rise and fall, the people benefit from it in no small measure. However, the reason why the people of various countries are able to benefit from the opposition parties is that they can implement the policies they have established after they gain power. The main reason why they can implement their policies is that the country is prosperous and the financial resources are abundant, making it easy to cope with the situation. If, from now on, commerce remains stagnant and the people's assets are depleted, and the government's revenue is difficult to collect, then the policies established before gaining power, no matter how appealing they may be, will be difficult to implement once in power. Therefore, in my opinion, the benefits of political party politics in various countries will not be as great as they once were.</p>

<h3>Foreign Reporters Tour the War-Torn Frontlines</h3>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Conversation During the Reception</p>

This battle is a battle between revolution and counter-revolution. The current war is not about occupying land, but about eliminating the enemy. The Longhai Railway has become the main battlefield and is making progress daily. The Feng army is the main force on that line, but three-quarters of it has been eliminated, and the remaining quarter is deeply hidden, so it is taking a little longer. I am confident that it can be completely resolved within a month. The Jin army on the Jinpu Railway who crossed the Yellow River will never be allowed to return. Our army on the Pinghan Railway is at Yancheng and Zhoujiakou. The Zhang Gui rebellion in Hunan will be completely resolved soon. Shi Yousan is surrounded and will be resolved soon. He once came to beg for surrender, but I did not agree. After this war, I am determined to make every effort to gradually realize Sun Yat-sen's plan for national construction (5th dispatch).</p>

<p>Important International News</p>
<p>British Cotton Industry Reorganization</p>
<p>Advisory Committee Publishes Report</p>
<p>Advocates Cooperation Between Labor and Management</p>
<p>Technical Methods Should Be Improved</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - The Economic Advisory Committee organized in August 1929 to investigate the cotton industry has now published its report. The committee was initially chaired by the Minister of Commerce, Graham, and later by the Minister of the Interior, Clynes. The report strongly emphasizes the necessity of cooperation between labor and management to reduce costs and increase efficiency. It states that unless action is taken in this regard, the Lancashire cotton industry may not be able to stem the decline in export volume or restore lost trade. It also states that the situation is extremely serious and that immediate action is imperative. The committee has proposed various measures, stating that if the cotton industry itself does not seriously consider the necessary methods to restore trade, the government's responsibility lies in considering asking Parliament to grant the necessary powers to implement the various measures proposed by the Advisory Committee. The report advocates for improvements in technical methods, such as: (1) using more short-staple Indian cotton to replace more expensive long-staple American cotton; (2) manufacturing inexpensive, general-purpose goods to restore the Far East market; (3) switching to ring spinning frames; (4) adopting automatic or semi-automatic looms. The report also suggests consolidating small units into larger units in the textile industry to formulate effective production policies. Such mergers may require a considerable amount of new capital, but according to the Advisory Committee, if there is any satisfactory and rational plan, the necessary financing will not be difficult to raise. The Advisory Committee believes that it is essential to develop cooperation across the entire industry. The cotton industry should also send people to inspect the changing situation abroad, with particular emphasis on the Far East, as the relationship between the Far East and the domestic situation is particularly important. The government should do everything possible to facilitate the work of foreign inspection teams. Representatives from various departments of the cotton industry are meeting in Manchester today to consider the report of the Cotton Industry Advisory Committee. Minister of the Interior Clynes addressed the meeting, saying that the government has instructed him to explain to the cotton industry the importance of the measures proposed by the Advisory Committee. The cotton industry should declare its willingness to adopt these proposals as a whole, as this reorganization method is within the scope of the cotton industry's own management. Representatives from both labor and management spoke, stating their willingness to seriously consider the report. Clynes concluded by saying that the government is willing to make every effort to address any difficulties that may arise when implementing the Advisory Committee's proposals.</p>
<p>Unrest in the Rhineland</p>
<p>Separatist Movement Members Under Pressure</p>
<p>Radical Elements Have Ulterior Motives</p>
<p>National Society, Mainz, 4th - The so-called separatist movement in the Rhineland was previously sheltered by the occupying forces, and no one dared to challenge it. Since the withdrawal of foreign troops, radical elements have taken collective action against those who usually led the movement and those suspected of sympathizing with it, resulting in disturbances to local order from time to time. After strict suppression by the authorities, this trend has been slightly curbed.</p>
<p>National Society, Mainz, 4th - The situation in the Rhineland remains quite tense. It is now believed that the recent acts of violence against the separatist movement are being carried out by extreme nationalist organizations outside the Rhineland. These people have a well-organized plan, not only to vent their anger and seek revenge but also to create diplomatic incidents to embarrass the government. The fact that they are arbitrarily destroying property and looting homes and shops, *</p>
<p>even those who have nothing to do with the separatist movement, are often affected because they have opposed right-wing extremists in the past, which is clear evidence. The authorities have now transferred police from Frankfurt and other places to Wiesbaden and Mainz to suppress the unrest.</p>

<p>National Society, Paris, 4th - The French Senate Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the Saar issue today. The German and French committee members have been negotiating this matter for several months in the hope of resolving it before the deadline set by Versailles. The French committee has now reported, advocating that France and Germany jointly form a company to mine coal in the Saar region. Therefore, the National Assembly is discussing the issue, raising questions to the government, and asking the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to attend the session today.</p>

<h3>Japan's Seiyukai Agrees to Tax Cuts</h3>
<p>Electrical Communication Agency, Tokyo, 5th - In the Seiyukai's Policy Research Council, the Special Committee on Reducing and Balancing the National Burden met at its headquarters yesterday afternoon. The committee reported that, firstly, because prices have fallen, creditors are receiving undue profits when recovering debts, so it is necessary to impose heavy taxes on certain debt recoveries to achieve equalization; secondly, as a result of the gold standard ban, export tariffs, although seemingly intended to assist industry, are essentially nonexistent, and it is urgent to revise tariffs. Australia, the United States, India, and other countries have adopted heavy taxes similar to import bans, while Japan alone maintains the old tariff rates, which should be reconsidered; thirdly, the salt monopoly must be abolished; fourthly, the reform and abolition of various tax systems must be studied. All of these were approved. After consultation, it was broadly decided to establish a tax reduction plan with a target of 50 million yuan. The meeting adjourned at dusk.</p>

<h3>European Federal Movement</h3>
<p>And its Current Difficulties</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent in Europe, Hua Lu)</p>
<p>(2) Briand's Plan</p>
<p>Among the seasoned diplomats on the European stage after the war, Briand can be considered the foremost. France has been the linchpin of European politics for over a decade since the war, and Briand has been the key operator. Many diplomatic figures of the old era have either died or stepped down, but the elder Briand remains uniquely brilliant. French political parties and cabinets rise and fall, but when it comes to diplomacy, they ultimately rely on this old man. He single-handedly crafted the Locarno Treaties, and he and Kellogg drafted the famous Kellogg-Briand Pact. The League of Nations depends on him as a pillar, and the Young Plan owes its implementation to him. These are all his signature moves in what he calls "peace organization" and "security policy." The so-called "peace organization" is about maintaining the victories France gained from the Treaty of Versailles, and the so-called "security policy" is about maintaining the international status quo under the control of a few major powers. With Locarno, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the League of Nations, and the Young Plan, Briand still felt it was not enough to guarantee Europe's security, so he came up with his grand scheme for a European Union.</p>
<p>On September 9th of last year, during the tenth session of the League of Nations General Assembly, Briand invited the plenipotentiary representatives of twenty-seven European countries to Geneva for an unprecedented "Pan-European Dinner." During the dinner, Briand, representing France, formally proposed the establishment of a European Grand Union. The representatives of the countries present all expressed their support, and it was decided at that time that France would draft a proposal, submit it to the various countries for their opinions, and then formally discuss it at the League of Nations General Assembly in September of this year. The French-drafted plan for a European Union was delivered to the governments of twenty-six European countries (all members of the League of Nations) on May 17th of this year, soliciting their opinions. Similar documents were also sent to the governments of Russia and Turkey, which are not members of the League of Nations, and to the governments of countries outside Europe. Let us now examine the contents of Briand's plan. (3) The Pan-European Union and the League of Nations Briand's Pan-European Union plan is several thousand words long, providing quite detailed explanations of the ideals and concrete plans for realizing the Pan-European Union. The full text can be divided into two parts: the first part is the preface, which summarizes the purpose and scope of activities of the Pan-European Union; the second part is about the procedures for preparation and organization. The preface states that the main purpose of the Pan-European Union is to promote political, economic, social, and peaceful relations in Europe, and to seek cooperation among European countries within the scope that does not conflict with the League of Nations. This new union not only does not conflict with the League of Nations, but is also not a new organization established outside the League of Nations. In other words, the Pan-European Union is merely a division within the League of Nations, organized on a regional basis. Countries joining the Pan-European Union must be member states of the League of Nations. The main purpose of the Pan-European Union is to assist the League of Nations and supplement its shortcomings. Furthermore, the Pan-European Union will not encroach on matters within the jurisdiction of the League of Nations International Court and the International Labour Bureau. To clarify the relationship between the Pan-European Union and the League of Nations, the executive body of the Pan-European Union will also be located in Geneva. This clearly defines the relationship between the League of Nations and the Pan-European Union, but whether there are difficulties in reality is another matter. As an Italian newspaper criticized, this Pan-European Union, if it is not a redundant organization, will inevitably conflict with the fundamental spirit of the League of Nations, because the creation of a separate union within the League of Nations will inevitably arouse suspicion among other member states. (4) The Pan-European Union and National Sovereignty</p>
<p>Briand's plan states that the Pan-European Union does not contain any intention of confronting other continents or any countries. The nature of the Pan-European Union is not only different from political and military alliances, but it is also by no means the kind of economic and tariff alliance aimed at confronting other countries. Originally, Briand was deeply concerned that the United States would suspect that the Pan-European Union was a tariff alliance against the United States, so he repeatedly explained in the plan, stating that the Pan-European Union was only seeking the common interests of European countries and had no intention of harming the interests of other countries or other continents.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Briand's plan, the so-called Pan-European Union does not harm the national sovereignty of the member states. All countries in the union are equal and free, and they work together for cooperation.</p>
<p>At the same time, it does not harm their absolute sovereignty and political independence. The Pan-European Union is merely a free association among countries, not a federal organization like the United States of North America or the German Confederation. Therefore, the Pan-European Union cannot be regarded as a federal state under international law. Conversely, countries joining the Pan-European Union do not lose their highest national authority as a result of joining the union.</p>
<p>(5) Implementation Plan How can this Pan-European Union be realized, and what are the concrete plans? According to Briand's plan, the first step is to conclude a Pan-European Convention. This convention stipulates the purpose and organizational outline of the Pan-European Union, and is signed jointly by European countries. After the convention is signed, the foundation of the Pan-European Union will be fixed. As for the organization of the union, it is divided into three parts: first, the Pan-European Assembly, which meets once a year and is a representative body of the union countries. Representatives from all union countries attend equally. To avoid any country from manipulating the process, the presidency of the assembly should be rotated annually among the representatives of the various countries. Second, the Pan-European Committee, which is an executive body, is composed of representatives of some of the union countries elected by the convention or the assembly. Its meeting place should be in Geneva. Third, the Secretariat, which is a permanent body, manages documents and convenes meetings, etc. Its address is also in Geneva. In short, this organization is entirely modeled on the League of Nations. The Pan-European Assembly is equivalent to the General Assembly of the League of Nations, the Pan-European Committee is equivalent to the Council of the League of Nations, and the Secretariat is equivalent to the permanent Secretariat of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>In addition, the plan also proposes several principles for the activities of the Pan-European Union: (1) economic issues are subordinate to political issues; (2) the principle of Pan-European political cooperation; (3) the principle of Pan-European economic organization. These principles only set out a general outline, and will be discussed at the next Pan-European conference.</p>
<p>(6) Difficulties Ahead</p>
<p>Briand's ideals and plans for the so-called Pan-European Union are roughly as described above. After the plan was sent to the governments of twenty-six European countries, the various governments will respond by July 15th, sending their opinions to the French government. The French government will then collect these opinions and report and discuss them at the League of Nations General Assembly in September. Therefore, whether this plan can be transformed from a paper document into reality, we can get a rough idea by looking at the General Assembly in September.</p>
<p>But in any case, no one dares to believe that such a large-scale alliance plan can become a reality in a short period of time. Even if the Pan-European Union is realized one day, it must go through countless twists and turns, because in the current situation, the future of the Pan-European Union movement is fraught with many difficulties. These difficulties arise from outside the alliance, namely the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union, and from inside the alliance, namely the attitudes of countries such as Britain, Italy, and Germany. Let us discuss them separately.</p>

<h3>Current Situation in Guangxi and the Entry of Yunnan Troops into Guangxi</h3>
<p>Guangdong Troops Maintain the Situation in Guangxi</p>
<p>Over Ten Thousand Yunnan Troops Enter Guangxi</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the death of Lü Huanyan in Guangxi, the Eighth Route Army has stationed its headquarters' chief advisor, Yang Dingzhong, in Wuzhou, to preside over military and political affairs in Guangxi Province. Currently, in Guangxi Province, only Liuzhou, Guilin, and other places still have a small number of remnants scattered, while all other important locations are garrisoned by the newly formed Guangxi Army and the Eighth Route Army. In the Dahe area, from Guiping to Jiangkou and other places, the newly formed Guangxi Army under Zhu Weizhen and others are deployed in Jiangkou, Tengxian, and Pingnan. In the Fuhe area, Lü Dingxiang, the newly appointed security commander of the nine prefectures of Pingle, is responsible for maintaining local security. Wuzhou, a strategic point between Guangdong and Guangxi, is garrisoned by the Eighth Route Army in Dadong Road, Beishan, Lion Fort, Dali Kou in Fuhe, and Rongxu. A portion of the troops are deployed in Dashan and Sanjiaozui, while in the remote northwest prefectures, remnants of Li Zongren's forces, such as Wei Yunsong and Lu Fuxiang's troops, are active. Recently, there have been reports that Cen Mengda's troops, remnants of Li and Huang's forces, are planning a revolt in Fuhe, but these are formed by local militias and enemy soldiers, lacking any combat capability and not a cause for concern. Although the various prefectures of Nanning and Liuzhou currently have Wei and Lu's troops, the Yunnan troops are rushing to Guangxi to take over the southwest and northwest of Guangxi Province. Long Yun, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government, has specially dispatched military liaison officer Feng Yi to Guangdong to discuss ways to deal with the situation in Guangxi, with the aim of coordinating troop movements. According to Feng's statements in Guangdong, the Yunnan troops entering Guangxi this time consist of sixteen regiments, including the entire 98th Division under Lu Han, the entire 99th Division under Zhu Xu, and the entire 101st Division under Zhang Chong. In addition, three regiments have been drawn from each division under Tang Jilin of the 7th Army and Zhang Fengchun of the 100th Division. There are also detachments under Li Shaozhong and Wang Chunshan, totaling over ten thousand men, all under the command of Lu Han, advancing towards Guangxi. The advance troops, including Li Shaozhong and Wang Chunshan's detachments, have already passed Baise and are expected to arrive in Nanning during the day. (July 1st dispatch)</p>

<h3>Financial Plan of the Hubei Authorities</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The national tax revenue of Hubei Province is over 17,940,000 yuan per year, but the budget for the 18th year estimates that the various expenses for provincial construction and local pacification require more than 30,870,000 yuan per year, so the income and expenditure are already far apart. This year, due to the continuous military conflicts in southern Henan and central Hunan, Hubei Province, due to its geographical location, has doubled the number of troops stationed, resulting in increased expenses. In addition, bandits in various counties have become rampant from time to time, destroying construction, obstructing transportation, and gradually weakening commerce, which has greatly affected the province's treasury revenue. For this reason, the difference between the income and expenditure of Hubei Province according to the budget is even greater. As of now, the full province's political expenses and pacification and public security funds for June have not yet been paid. Zhang Guanshi, the Director of the Finance Department, has been negotiating with the Wuhan banking group for several days to borrow 150,000 yuan, using gypsum transported from Yingcheng to Hankou as collateral, and borrowing another 850,000 yuan with other collateral, totaling 1 million yuan, to meet urgent needs. It is said that the banking group has already agreed and will sign a contract and pay the money within the next week. In addition, the various members of the Provincial Government, in order to seek sufficient financial revenue, decided at a political affairs meeting on the 1st to establish a special tax surcharge bureau directly under the Provincial Government. Various goods will be taxed at 20% of the regular tax, in order to supplement the provincial treasury, and Gui Jingqiu has been appointed as the Director-General of the Special Tax Surcharge Bureau, and preparations are currently underway. In addition, Chen Shaogui, the Special Commissioner for Hubei Finance of the Ministry of Finance, is also raising military expenses, which are very large. He recently negotiated with the banking group to borrow 2 million yuan for military expenses, using the salt tax of Hubei as collateral. After discussions at various banks, it was decided to lend 750,000 yuan, using the revenue from refined salt tax as collateral. Yesterday, Wang Yiling and Shen Jixuan were appointed as representatives to meet with Chen to discuss the matter, which is generally settled. Today (2nd), Chen took a boat to Yichang, and it is said that he will negotiate with the Sichuan salt merchants to borrow money to meet the urgent military needs. (July 2nd)</p>
<h3>Dai Yue Leads Troops Through Hankou and Returns to Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Defeated Peng Dehuai's Troops When Passing Yuezhou</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Dai Yue's brigade was previously ordered to assist Hunan. Now that the Zhang-Gui forces can be wiped out, they have been ordered to return to their defense and await orders. Dai led his troops through Liling and Changsha, and took the Gongping and Xiangtao ships, arriving in Hankou at 5:00 PM on the 4th. That evening, they transferred to Jiujiang and went straight back to Nanchang. This reporter recently visited Dai, who said that when the remnants of the Zhang-Gui forces fled to Hunan, his brigade was ordered to transfer troops from eastern Jiangxi and set off at full speed. They departed from Xi Gui Ba on June 2nd and arrived in Liling on the 25th, engaging in melee combat with the enemy more than a dozen times. Now the Zhang-Gui forces are heavily surrounded by the 48th Route Army and can be fundamentally resolved. Director He will be able to return to Hankou in triumph in two or three days. After receiving the order to return to Jiangxi, his brigade boarded the train in Liling on June 30th and arrived in Changsha on the 1st of this month. On the 2nd, they set sail from Changsha and arrived at Nanjin Port near Yuezhou at noon on the 3rd, where they encountered Peng Dehuai's troops and immediately landed and defeated them. The remaining bandits seemed to have fled towards Pingjiang. His brigade did not pursue them due to the urgency of the schedule. It is believed that the troops stationed in Hunan will be able to intercept and wipe them out. (July 4th)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Deploys Troops to Suppress Zhu De and Mao Zedong</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Zhu and Mao fled from Huichang to Guangdong, where they were blocked and attacked by the Guangdong army.</p>
<p>Then they re-entered Fujian, and recently fled from Tingzhou and Shanghang to Ruijin and Shicheng in eastern Jiangxi, invading Guangchang. According to political circles, Zhu and Mao captured Guangchang at the end of last month, causing extremely tragic killings. After receiving the news, Chairman Lu immediately ordered Lu Xiaochen, the Provincial Government Member and Director of the Security Department, to supervise the troops and suppress them. Lu borrowed 50,000 yuan for the departure expenses from the banking community yesterday and will lead the 2nd Police Regiment (reorganized from the security team) and all the staff of the Security Department today, stationed in Linchuan (Fuzhou), in order to cooperate with Wang Zhenhuan, the Joint Defense Director of Fujian, who will lead the defense teams of more than ten counties in Fujian, to advance from Nanfeng to Guangchang to attack Zhu and Mao, in the hope of eliminating them. As for the provincial capital, the police regiment, the 18th Division's special service battalion, artillery battalion, engineer battalion, supplementary regiment, and the 1st and 2nd security teams of the Municipal Public Security Bureau are currently stationed there, with a force of more than one brigade, and the security is extremely consolidated. In addition, Dai Yue's brigade of the 18th Division has departed from Pingxiang and arrived in Zhangshu, and will soon arrive in the province. Zhu Yaohua's brigade and the two commanders Tan and Jin are also returning to Jiangxi Province one after another to suppress Zhu and Mao. Chairman Lu also telegraphed He Yingqin yesterday, requesting the allocation of two airplanes, which will be sent to Jiangxi immediately, in order to use them for bandit suppression. After the major units entering Hunan and the airplanes arrive in Jiangxi, Zhu and Mao will not be difficult to eliminate. As for western Jiangxi, which has always been a haven for bandits, the bandits often shoot at ships and intercept civilian ships along the Ganjiang River, causing traffic to be cut off and travelers to hesitate. Since Deng Ying's division was stationed in Ji'an, it has specially dispatched the Minzu and Minquan ships, equipped with machine guns and mortars, to patrol the Ji'an, Xiajiang, Taihe, and Wan'an areas every day to maintain the shipping from Ganzhou to Nanchang. As for Zhang Huizan, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression for the entire province, who resigned, Chairman Lu and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek successively persuaded him to stay, and Zhang has agreed to work hard to suppress the bandits under Lu's leadership in the future.

<h3>The Silk Industry in Zhejiang is in Crisis</h3>
<p>Comparison of the Silk Situation in the Past Two Years</p>
<p>New Plan to Promote Silk Industry Decided</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province's silk production is concentrated in the four prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Shaoxing. The silk industry has long been in decline due to the influence and manipulation of Japanese merchants. The silk industry has also suffered from the influx of foreign goods and the emergence of rayon fabrics, resulting in no sales. Many factories have successively declared bankruptcy. In the four prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Shaoxing, statistics show that no less than 90 factories have closed down in the past two years, totaling approximately 5,600 or more looms stopped. As for the price of silk, the total output of new silk this year is 10-16% lower than in the 17th year, and 10-14% lower than in the 18th year. The price of silk has not been estimated yet due to sluggish sales. The output of silk this year is 10-14% lower than in the 17th year and 10-13% lower than in the 18th year. The income from the price of silk, except for slight easing due to the promotion of domestic goods, has only been about 2 to 3 million yuan for the entire province from January to the present. At a time when the cost of living is rising daily, merchants are losing their capital and workers are losing their jobs, totaling more than 37,000 people. The crisis is all around, and it is painful to speak of it. The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in view of the above situation and the appeals of silk merchants, has been striving to reorganize silk donations from the collection side, so as not to cause silk merchants any pain, and has proposed to reduce the original amount of silk donations by one-fourth, and has decided to implement it by issuing a notice. However, in reality, it is still unable to reverse the tide, so it has ordered the Construction Department to make a proper plan to provide relief. It is learned that the department has drafted a silk revival plan for the 19th year, which has been sent to the provincial government for deliberation and approval, and is hereby recorded: (1) Planting Mulberry Trees: Propaganda and guidance to encourage farmers to plant mulberry trees automatically. (2) Seed Production: Expand the amount of original seed production to 560,000 moths, and stop ordinary production. Add a seed production business management office, and reorganize the two model farms in Yu Hang and Yin County. It is estimated that the province has 1.8 million original seeds, supplying 6.5 million sheets for silk production. (3) Rearing and Drying Cocoons: Establish guidance centers to promote new-style cocoon drying machines. (4) Silk Production: Establish two model silk factories, and establish a fresh cocoon cold storage. As for the relief of the silk industry, it is also decided that after the international trade commissioner investigates the needs of various countries and reports to the province, the international transportation and sales of silk will be carried out. (July 5th)</p>
<h3>Reorganization Completed for the Anhui Provincial Federation of Commerce</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Anhui Provincial Federation of Commerce convened its second provincial representatives' conference, which opened on June 5th. Originally, the plan was to carry out reorganization and elections according to the new regulations immediately after the representatives' conference. However, a request was submitted to the party and government organs for record and supervision. The provincial government, in response, ordered Shao Yizhou, the Director of the Wuhu Municipal Preparatory Office, to supervise the election on its behalf. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, however, did not respond. The provincial party headquarters believed that the lower-level chambers of commerce were not well-organized, making the reorganization of the Federation fundamentally illegal, and ordered it to be stopped. The Wuhu Municipal Party Headquarters also telegraphed the province, requesting a strict injunction to prevent manipulation. Civic groups such as the Municipal Association of Merchants and People even posted slogans, vehemently opposing it, fearing that small and medium-sized merchants would have no foothold in the future. Therefore, the originally scheduled election conference on the 18th did not take place. One side dispatched representatives such as Chen Zhongyu and Zhang Peiqiu to petition in both Beijing and the province, requesting understanding, emphasizing that the Provincial Federation of Commerce was related to the development of commerce and the unity of merchants throughout the province, so as to avoid representatives from various places making futile trips. It was not until June 28th, after the ninth representatives' conference, that a resolution was made to postpone the reorganization election. However, the representatives from various counties in northern and central Anhui deeply believed that their long journey to Wuhu was for the sake of unity among merchants in the province. If reorganization could not proceed this time, the Ministry's order had already been announced, and after August 15th, the Provincial Federation of Commerce would legally become invalid. Moreover, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, as the competent authority, had not explicitly approved but also not formally denied it, practically implying tacit consent. How could they easily abandon it on their own? The only concern was the Wuhu Municipal Executive Committee. Therefore, many representatives were again dispatched to smooth things over. Fortunately, there were no problems. The tenth representatives' conference then resolved to hold the election meeting on July 2nd. However, many county representatives had already returned home due to the prolonged delay. To provide temporary relief, representatives were entrusted to attend the meeting and vote. Many staff members of the Federation of Commerce and the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce were entrusted. The meeting opened at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. The Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched more than 20 armed security guards and more than 10 members of the merchant corps to maintain order at the entrance. Shao Yizhou, the Director of the Municipal Office, the supervisory committee member of the Provincial Government was unable to attend and sent the head of section Ye Hongyu as representative. Representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Jingxian County Party Headquarters, Xi Guoguang, the Public Security Bureau Chief Yu Mingxun, and County Magistrate Sun Liangchou were all present. Representatives from 51 chambers of commerce were present. Wu Xingzhou, the former Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Commerce, served as the General Chairman. After the meeting opened, ballots were distributed. The results were announced at 5:30 PM. The fifteen people elected as executive committee members were: She Ceqin, Yuan Doushu, Li Zhuxi, Tao Yutang, Wu Xingzhou, Chen Zhongyu, Zhang Peiqiu, Ding Xizhai, Cui Lianggong, Gao Shaohou, Zhang Xiaozhai, Huang Deji, Ding Jiarui, Luo Shaoquan, and Zhang Xiaoshan. The seven elected as supervisory committee members were: Lu Tingzhen, Xu Xinpu, Li Qingwu, Wang Rongzhen, Ma Zaoxin, Zhang Yongtang, and Shi Zhongxin. (July 2nd)</p>
<p>Another Dispatch: The fifteen executive committee members elected during the reorganization of the Anhui Provincial Federation of Commerce, including Wu Xingzhou, and the seven supervisory committee members, including Lu Tingzhen, held their swearing-in ceremony at 2 PM this afternoon. In addition to the committee members, the oath takers included Ye Hongyu, the representative of the Provincial Government and the Municipal Office, Li Gengchang, the Superintendent of Wuhu Customs, Yu Mingxun, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, Sun Gongming, the County Magistrate, and Liu Shanan, the representative of the Municipal Party. Chairman Wu Xingzhou first delivered the opening remarks, followed by the swearing-in. Wu Xingzhou read the oath. Subsequently, representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Superintendent Li, Ye Hongyu, County Magistrate Sun, and Bureau Chief Yu successively gave speeches. Finally, Wu Xingzhou delivered a reply. After the ceremony, a meeting was held to elect the standing committee members and the chairman. As a result, Wu Xingzhou, Zhang Peiqiu, Yuan Doushu, Li Zhuxi, and Tao Yutang were elected as standing committee members. Wu Xingzhou was elected as the chairman. They were sworn in immediately and then a photo was taken and the meeting adjourned. (July 4th)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Express</h3>
<p>In the Xixiang area of Lujiang County, more than 500 bandits were discovered. Yesterday, Xu Xiangdou, the head of the Lujiang People's Self-Defense Corps, together with the first, second, third, and sixth teams of the county police, encircled and suppressed the bandits in Kejiatan Town. They encountered and engaged in a fierce battle that lasted all day, killing twelve bandits, capturing Zhu and Song, seizing more than ten rifles, and intercepting forty-some captured hostages. There were also casualties among the government soldiers. Xiong Huiru, the training captain of the Self-Defense Corps, was injured and died in action. The bandits are currently still being surrounded and suppressed.</p>
<p>The provincial government has ordered the Wuhu Municipal Office to continue collecting the public welfare surtax on rapeseed according to the regular tax rate. However, the General Chamber of Commerce believes that the donation is temporary in nature, and that the funds for Wuhu education have already been sufficiently increased through the land tax and the creation of a municipal tax for local public welfare. It is therefore impossible to increase the burden further and has replied to the Municipal Office that it will resist to the death.</p>
<p>The old system of Wuhu County's autonomous regions divided the four townships into six districts. The new system divides the four townships into seven districts and includes the urban area, making a total of eight districts. Recently, County Magistrate Sun has reported to the provincial government that the municipal office will incorporate the urban area into the municipal area, which has caused a dispute and requested the provincial government to verify.</p>
<h3>Women and Children in the Shaanxi Disaster</h3>
<p>The disaster situation in Shaanxi Province is becoming increasingly serious. The Shaanxi Disaster Relief News Agency issued a report yesterday stating that the drought in Shaanxi has been prolonged, and the dead are piled up in the fields, while the displaced are endless. Mr. Zhu Qinglan previously came to Shaanxi and saw many homeless women, children, and displaced children of both sexes wandering in the provincial capital. The tragic situation was distressing to see. Before leaving Shaanxi, he entrusted Zhang Huanhai, Lu Hefe, Yang Mushi, and others, the standing committee members of the North China Charity Federation he founded, to establish a women and children's shelter and a disaster relief and education center for children, each with a limit of one thousand people. They began accepting people on June 1st. It has not been long, but there is already an overcrowding problem. The disaster is so severe, and the disaster relief funds distributed by various charities in Shaanxi have mostly been exhausted. He Hengfu and others, the disaster relief committee members of the Hankou Tongyuan Shiji Society, have already returned east a few days ago. Zhang Xianqing and others, the disaster relief committee members of the Shanghai General Association of the Chinese Jisheng Society, will also return to Shanghai in two or three days to report on the disaster relief progress and raise disaster relief funds from all parties. The lives and deaths of the disaster victims depend on this moment. It is hoped that philanthropists from all over the world will continue to raise large amounts of disaster relief funds and send them to Shaanxi to save the survivors of this disaster, so as not to let the effort fall short of success.</p>

<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<p>Jiading</p>
<p>Failure to Divorce Leads to Violence: Qian Pinyi from Fanqiao in the eastern township married Ji Yibao from the same village the year before last. The couple's relationship was initially harmonious, and they had a daughter. However, after Qian went to Shanghai to study at Dongya University, he suddenly became disgusted with Ji and applied to the county government for a divorce, which was rejected. As a result, he harbored resentment towards Ji and beat her severely some days ago, leaving her covered in bruises. Ji, unable to bear it any longer, reported the incident to the county. The couple will soon meet again in court.</p>
<p>Arrest of Imposter Party Investigator: Zhang Hongsheng, residing in Xuxing Town outside the east gate, is a scoundrel. After becoming acquainted with a worker named He from the county party headquarters, his influence grew. Some days ago, he impersonated a county party headquarters investigator and went to the town's public security substation to question Inspector Lü for not banning gambling and smoking. Inspector Lü suspected his behavior and telegraphed the county party headquarters, which informed him that Zhang had not been sent as an investigator. He ordered Zhang to be taken to the city for investigation and processing. He is currently detained in the county public security bureau.</p>

<p>Kidnappers and Hostages Escorted to Headquarters: At 2 AM last night, Yang Xingsheng, the leader of the police substation stationed in Zhuanghang, led police in breaking up a kidnapping case at Su Guirong's house in the 39th block of Zhugangtan, about five miles from the town. Five hostages, both adults and children, were rescued on the spot. After questioning by the team leader, the kidnappers Wang Asan (aka Aheshang), Su Guirong (aka Agui), Shen Youdi, and the bandit woman He Aizhen, along with the hostages Zhou Jinqing, Zhou Wenwei, Chen Kechang, Chen Keliang, and Chen Ayan (all farmers from Zhangpu Hezawa in Kunshan), were ordered to be escorted by a platoon leader to the Nanqiao headquarters for interrogation. Meanwhile, Team Leader Yang also sent a special messenger to notify the families of the hostages to come and identify them. It is said that they had not been kidnapped for ten days. Although there had been several negotiations, the ransom was too high, so no agreement had been reached.</p>
<p>Ransom Reduced by Five Thousand in Lu Kidnapping Case: The young son of a farmer surnamed Lu in the 16th block of Zhuanghang was kidnapped, with a ransom of 20,000 demanded. It is now learned that the Lu family sent their clan chief, Lu Ziyun, and Lu's mother to negotiate with the bandits twice. It is said that the negotiations failed because of the large difference in price. However, some days ago, the bandits suddenly sent another letter, reducing the ransom to 5,000, otherwise they would tear up the ticket within three days. However, the Lu family has less than one hundred acres of land and a poor family background, so they only want to pay two hundred yuan as travel expenses. Lu's mother also personally pleaded with the representatives of the bandits for mercy, but to no avail. It is now learned that the kidnapping case, according to investigations by the water and land police, was instigated by a certain party in Qiliqiao in the county. Therefore, Company Commander Wang Jinchuan has ordered Shen Pengtu, the captain of the third cabin, to go to Shanghai yesterday and order him to surrender.</p>

<p>Groundbreaking Ceremony for the Demolition of the Moon City: The demolition of the Moon City in this county has already been put out to tender. The demolition first began at the Moon City in the east gate. Director Jin, Director Xu of the Construction Bureau, and others invited representatives from various party and government agencies to hold a groundbreaking ceremony at the Moon City in the east gate at 2 PM on the 5th. The groundbreaking ceremony for the Moon City in the west gate is scheduled for the 20th, followed by the demolition of the north and south Moon Cities in turn. However, the houses of Pan Wanxing's jade shop in the west gate should be included in the demolition. They have requested the county government to designate nearby public land for exchange and to estimate the demolition costs in order to rebuild their business. After receiving the report, the county government submitted it to the 64th county government meeting, which decided that they must demolish the buildings within the time limit notified by the Construction Bureau. As for the designated exchange location, it should be processed after the demolition of the Moon City. The demolition costs will be issued after the Construction Bureau has assessed and confirmed them. As for the barracks base and open space under the city wall remaining after the demolition of the Moon City in the west gate, some people have requested that they be completely preserved and allocated for use as a vegetable market. It is said that the county government has ordered the Construction Bureau to collect the cases, plan and draw up diagrams, and then submit them to the meeting for review and discussion.</p>
<p>Robbery and Injury at Wanghe Village: The house of Dr. Ye Shaoqing in Wanghe Village in Punan was robbed by bandits the night before last. When the villagers heard the alarm and sounded gongs, two people were shot and wounded by the bandits. One was seriously injured and unlikely to recover, while the other was injured in the foot and not seriously. Ye has been robbed twice last summer and winter, suffering considerable losses.

<p>Local People Request that the County Magistrate Not Be Transferred: County Magistrate Sun Zuji has been in office for more than a year, and has achieved considerable results in handling county affairs. Now that the provincial government has decided to transfer him, the local people are greatly disappointed. Three representatives were appointed yesterday to petition the provincial government, requesting that he not be transferred so that he can use his experience. Meanwhile, Wu Zhihui, a local member of the Central Supervisory Committee, sent another letter to Chairman Ye and Director Hu of the Provincial Civil Affairs Department, requesting that County Magistrate Sun be exempted from transfer to appease the public.</p>
<p>Major Secret Gambling Den Cracked: The Chunyu Society Teahouse in Yaozhuangbang outside the south gate of Xiyi has a secret gambling den with an extremely well-organized structure. The front building sells tea, and the back building is used for gambling. There is a door in the wall that leads to the inner room. A bell is installed in the drawer of the gambling cabinet downstairs. If there is an alarm, the gambling room immediately presses the bell, and the gamblers can escape calmly. Therefore, it has never been cracked. Yesterday, Zhou Jiashan, the director of the eighth public security sub-bureau in charge, received a tip and personally led the police to search. By the time they arrived at the Chunyu Teahouse, the gamblers had already fled upon hearing the alarm. Only playing cards and other gambling equipment remained. All of them were seized, and the teahouse owner Zhu Aben and the waiter A Er were arrested. After a preliminary interrogation, they were immediately sent to the Public Security Bureau to be transferred to the County Government for legal action.</p>
<p>Continuous Thunderstorms Discuss the Progress of Agricultural Machinery: In recent years, the fields in the four townships have used water-lifting machines to irrigate and transplant seedlings into the fields. Therefore, the transplanting of seedlings by farmers in the county this year has been unusually fast. It was completed about ten days ago, and the seedlings are developing very quickly. However, since ten days ago, there have been thunderstorms every day, causing the river water to rise by one, two, or three feet. The lowest fields have become swamps, and even the slightly higher fields have river water higher than the field water. The Yangjiawei, Furongwei, Lingdangwei, and Shangzhongxiawei areas in the north township are all in danger. If the thunderstorms continue, it will inevitably lead to a desperate situation. Yesterday, a small steamship sailing from Jiangyin to Wuxi was stopped by the farmers of Yangjiawei after it passed Shichuang because the waves eroded the embankment soil, which made transportation quite inconvenient. Other steamships in various places also temporarily suspended operation due to the high water level to protect farmland.</p>

On the morning of the 3rd, they arrested a robber named Mei Qiaoyu in Yaoguanxiang. During the preliminary interrogation, he confessed that Qu Renbing from the same village was also involved in the case. Qu was arrested shortly after. On the 4th, the two robbers were escorted to the prosecutor's office of the county court for interrogation. Their confessions were cunning and evasive, and they were ordered to be detained.</p>

His family was living in Chenjia of the Sanguan Township. Five bandits broke into it some days ago and robbed them of 200 yuan in banknotes and more than 700 yuan in clothing and ornaments. Liao's wife reported to platoon leader Liu Zonghan and sent a letter to the county for investigation. County Magistrate Li ordered the Public Security Bureau to issue an arrest warrant. Director Li believed that Chenjiawei was not far from the city, and the bandits were so rampant, so he instructed Fan Yu, the inspector of the second substation, to strictly investigate the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding Occurs in Director Tao's Handling of the Case: Tao Zu'en, the director of the Qingyang Public Security Second Sub-Bureau, went to the Jiang Taigong Temple on the border of Wenlin Township and Huaishang City of Wuxi (mistakenly written as Qingcheng City yesterday) on the 2nd to arrest sorcerers. Because the temple was collecting money in the name of God, a misunderstanding occurred with Shi Bingxiang of the Huangtutang Business Group, almost leading to a conflict. The business group also vented their anger on Jiang Yizun, a standing committee member of the district party headquarters. Later, Tao sent the two temple monks he had captured to the Jiangyi Changjing District Office. Yesterday (the 4th), Director Tao of Qingyang returned to Qingyang and decided to report the seized fake elixirs and prescriptions to the headquarters today for handling.</p>

<p>Standing Committee Meeting of the Provincial Women's Reorganization Association: The Jiangsu Provincial Women's Association Reorganization Committee held its 13th standing committee meeting yesterday. The attendees were Tao Xiaodong, Zhao Yuzheng, and Shi Liang. The following important cases were discussed and resolved: (1) Recently, reactionary factions have adopted a strategy of engaging in women's activities in various places. In necessary circumstances, the Provincial Party Reorganization Committee should be requested to promptly publish the cases of the Women's Reorganization Committees. The resolution was passed, and the four counties of Wuxian, Danyang, Pi County, and Wujin were requested to publish first.

The resolution was to submit a request to the Provincial Party Reorganization Committee to consult the Provincial Government and instruct the counties to allocate funds according to the standards stipulated by the province. (3) Open gambling by residents in the provincial capital is still common. It was decided to send a letter to the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau to ban it. (4) The practice of mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law abusing child brides in various counties has not diminished at all compared to the autocratic era. It is inhumane and infringes on freedom. It was decided to submit a request to the Provincial Party Reorganization Committee to consult the Provincial Government and instruct the counties to strictly prohibit it. (5) Among the oppressed women in various counties, there is an endless stream of requests to the women's reorganization committee for assistance because their husbands cannot maintain their livelihoods and abuse them. It was decided to submit a request to the Provincial Party Reorganization Committee to transfer to the Provincial Government and instruct the counties to establish relief centers as much as possible to accommodate them.</p>
<p>The Provincial Chronicle Compilation Committee Requests Appointment of Interviewers: The Jiangsu Provincial Chronicle Compilation Committee believes that to compile the provincial chronicle and collect the facts that should be recorded throughout the province, although there are interview specialists, the number of quotas is small, and the information may not be comprehensive. Yesterday, it specially sent a letter to the provincial government, ordering the county magistrates, directors of education, finance, and construction bureaus of each county to serve as interviewers for the Jiangsu Provincial Chronicle Compilation Committee to conduct extensive consultations.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Cow Tax Disputes in Dayi Township: The cow tax in Dayi Township, under the jurisdiction of this county, was originally managed by Yu Dianhou, a local township director. However, with the establishment of the district office, the tax collection was taken back by the district office. Subsequently, Yu and others, in the name of the town office, petitioned the county government to increase the quota and allow the town office to handle it, leading to ongoing disputes between the two parties. Later, Zhu Xuanxi, the ninth district chief, along with other township chiefs, jointly petitioned the county government, requesting that the tax collection remain under district management. Unexpectedly, Yu's ambition remained unfulfilled, and it is now reported that he has again petitioned the Department of Civil Affairs for review. However, most of the cow tax revenue is allocated to education funding, and it is now reported that the Bureau of Education, based on the department's order, is also strongly advocating for the recovery of the tax collection in order to adhere to the principle of independent education funding.</p>
<p>Salt Smugglers Gather at Gongdao Bridge: More than a dozen large and small salt boats, carrying approximately one hundred people, suddenly arrived at Gongdao Bridge in the northern part of this county the day before yesterday. They landed and dispersed to places like Miaotou Town to sell salt. The local residents were initially alarmed upon seeing this, and the security corps considered arresting them. However, they learned that the smugglers' boats were heavily armed, so they did not take action. It was also reported that the smugglers only sold salt in the area and did not disturb the people. However, the salt was sold at a low price, so the residents eagerly competed to buy it.</p>
<p>Wounded Soldiers Arrive in Yangzhou for Treatment: After the Ministry of Military Affairs dispatched personnel to Yangzhou to establish the 27th Rear Hospital, it has been learned that the first group of approximately two hundred wounded soldiers, arriving from Zhenjiang, reached Yangzhou yesterday (the 3rd).

<p>Order to Investigate Yangqiao Township Police Station: After the abolition of the public security branch station in Yangqiao Township, this county, the High Port Water Public Security Team and the local security corps were responsible for maintaining local order. Now, the county, based on a consultation report from the Reorganization Committee and a report from the (Daqiao) Public Security Bureau in the district, has re-established a police station in the township. It is reported that because the township is located on the Yangtze River, there are instances of smuggling opium. The county specially ordered An Zheng, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, yesterday (the 3rd) to investigate the truth and whether the police station should be abolished, and to report back for review.</p>

<p>Investigation of Fundraising Throughout the County: In recent years, various fundraising activities for public works projects throughout Nantong County have been coordinated through the administrative organs in the four townships, but there has been no clear public announcement. Currently, various sectors have resolved to petition the county government to order the original handlers in each district to submit their accounts to the county for review and to make item-by-item public announcements within half a month. County Magistrate Zhang has already acted accordingly.</p>
<p>Establishment of Security Committee: Due to the unrest caused by bandits in various districts of Nantong, security corps are being established in each district.

<p>Pinghu</p>
<p>Rice-Snatching Riot Erupts in Zhapu: Around 1:00 PM on the 3rd, about four or five hundred refugees from the Xixiang Sidai area suddenly arrived in Zhapu. Citing the high price of rice and the difficulty of making a living, they swarmed into various rice shops, including Shengtaisun, Suitai, and Qiashengfu, and seized over a hundred dan of stored rice. Subsequently, they went to the Shengyuan Rice Shop in the Zongguan Alley to attempt a robbery, but were unsuccessful. The rice shop owners in the city, knowing the situation, quickly closed their doors, thus avoiding losses. They then swarmed into the Xuchanglin Rice Shop in Haiyan Alley, seizing silver dollars, banknotes, and copper coins from the counter. Duanmu He, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, immediately led the police to quell the riot, but was unsuccessful. The local order was disrupted for a time. Around 6:00 PM, another group of about fifty or sixty people entered the city from the West Gate. The police officers did not stop them as they passed the Public Security Branch Bureau. They swarmed into the Zhenxing Rice Shop in Sipailou East and seized over ten shi of rice. Afterward, the rice industry colleagues convened an emergency meeting and immediately requested the chamber of commerce to telegraph the county government for review. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Fang, on the morning of the 4th, accompanied by the water police captain and twenty patrol officers, personally went to investigate and discuss solutions. As a result, it was decided to set up a temporary rice shop to sell rice at a fixed price, temporarily set at 450 cash per sheng, with a limit of five sheng per person. County Magistrate Fang returned to Pinghu that afternoon at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Continued Report on Flat-Price Rice Situation: The operation of flat-price rice sales in the city has been ongoing for several days. Villagers coming to the city to buy rice have not been seen to be overcrowded. This flat-price sale is being organized by over thirty rice shops in the city, fearing the possibility of rice-snatching riots, it has been perfunctorily handled for the time being. The villagers believe that the restriction of no more than three sheng per household and the price reduction of only two foreign cents per sheng, which is equivalent to no more than seventeen copper coins for three sheng, is not worth the effort and time spent traveling from the village to the city. Moreover, the poor families lack even a penny to afford the price of three sheng of flat-price rice, so they are hesitant to come forward.</p>
<p>Young Woman Caught Stealing on the Spot: Ai Bao, a young woman in her prime, working at the Shen Bamboo Shop in the Nanhetan area of Zhapu, is of questionable character and habitually uses theft as a means. Yesterday, she went to the Zhang Tongyuan foreign goods store on Nanmen Main Street, using the pretense of buying cosmetics as a cover. Taking advantage of the shop assistant's inattention, she stole a leather suitcase. However, she was spotted by a bystander, who secretly informed the shop assistant. The shop assistant then stopped Ai Bao and searched her person, finding the original item. They wanted to call the police to arrest her, but the wife of a man named Shen, who had come with her, earnestly apologized and persuaded them to let it go, and the matter was dropped.</p>

They then headed towards the main road in the back.</p>
<p>Bandits Extort the Lu Family in Wuxing: Lu Yanchun, a resident of the Bicun area of Guoxiwang in Wuxing, was known for his wealth. However, in recent years, due to poor harvests and a bad silkworm season, he could barely make ends meet. Last month, he received a letter from bandits demanding three thousand six hundred yuan in foreign currency. Lu ignored the demand because the requested amount was too large and he could not raise it. Unexpectedly, two bandits suddenly came to Lu Yanchun's house to demand the money the day before yesterday. They asked where Lu was. Fortunately, Lu was away from home at the time. A neighbor surnamed Mou came out to plead with the bandits repeatedly. The bandits finally reduced the amount to two hundred and sixty yuan, stating that the money should be delivered between the 10th and 15th of this month at Qingshanwu.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>Commodity Exhibition Hall to Open Soon: The new Western-style building on the old site of the government office in Zhongshan Park in the city has long been completed. Originally intended to be used as a commodity exhibition hall, it has not been realized due to limited funding.

Wu Wangji has been appointed by the provincial propaganda department as the president, responsible for managing it. It is reported that the newspaper has been reorganized since the 1st of this month.</p>
<p>Shangyu</p>
<p>Robbery of Xuyilong Rice Shop: Around 5:00 PM on the 30th of last month, the Xuyilong Rice Shop in Xiejiatang, eastern township, was suddenly broken into by over ten robbers, who smashed the shop door and looted it. The shop owner, Xu Zhenqing, upon hearing the alarm, jumped out of the rear building window and climbed onto a neighboring house, escaping harm. The robbers searched the house for half an hour before leaving. Upon inspection, it was found that over two hundred yuan had been lost. The shop had just transferred twelve hundred yuan in cash from somewhere the day before, and unexpectedly, it attracted the attention of the robbers. Fortunately, the hidden stash was not taken.</p>
<p>Shen Qiankui's Son Escapes Danger: Shen Qiankui's son, a resident of the Shaqiu Village in Xiejiatang, northern township, was kidnapped by bandits on the night of March 1st.

<p>Taizhou</p>

After several hours of fierce fighting, over twenty bandits were killed on the spot, and over twenty firearms were seized. The bandits were unable to resist and fled towards Tiantai Caoshan.</p>
<p>Opposition to Increasing House Police Tax in Linhai: Zhang Zhiyuan, the chief of the Public Security Bureau of the Linhai County Government, has requested the Department of Civil Affairs to increase the house police tax to add fifty police officers to the existing one hundred police officers in the county, which are insufficient. The county chamber of commerce in this county believes that Linhai is poor and has suffered from floods for years, causing great losses to the people. They are unable to bear the existing house police tax, let alone an increase. They have telegraphed the Department of Civil Affairs, requesting it to revoke the increase to show compassion.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Ministry-Promulgated Provisional Curriculum Standards Extended for One Year</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has extended the provisional curriculum standards for kindergartens, primary schools, junior high schools, and senior high school general courses for one year, still as provisional standards. It instructed the education departments and bureaus of each province and city to follow the order, which stated:</p>
<p>The Ministry has previously stipulated and issued the provisional standards for primary and secondary school curricula, including the four types of kindergarten, primary school, junior high school, and senior high school general courses, and ordered the schools under the jurisdiction of the department to conduct practical trials. The trial period will soon expire, and the schools have not reported the results of the practical verification of these curriculum standards. The Ministry has no basis for revising these standards. The curriculum of schools is of great importance, and the Ministry will not rush to seek details. It is hereby decided to extend the trial period for one school year, still as provisional standards. During this extended trial period, the previous order should still be followed, and the schools under the jurisdiction should continue to report the results of their trial research at any time for reference. In addition to separate orders, this urgent order is issued for compliance.</p>
<h3>Examination Methods for Students</h3>
<p>from Unregistered Schools</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education is drafting a plan with three main points.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously instructed national and registered private universities that students from private middle schools and vocational schools that have not been approved by the Ministry of Education are strictly prohibited from being admitted to these universities. After the issuance of this order, national and registered private schools have complied. However, there are too many unregistered universities, vocational schools, and middle schools in the past. Once their qualifications for further education are suspended, it would be detrimental to young people's enthusiasm for learning. It is now heard that the Ministry of Education, in view of this, plans to formulate methods for students from unregistered private schools at all levels to apply to national or registered private universities to provide relief. According to an official of the Ministry, the plan has not yet been drafted, but the relief measures will likely be divided into three types: (1) Graduates from unregistered private schools before 1920 who have applied to national universities or private universities that have been approved by the Ministry of Education must be reported to the local education departments and bureaus for strict examination and screening. If all subjects are satisfactory, they may be allowed to apply. (2) Order the education departments and bureaus of each province and city to organize examination committees to ensure caution. (3) Students from schools that have not applied for registration after 1920 should be strictly prohibited from applying to national or registered private universities.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education to Formulate</h3>
<p>Standards for Registration of Private Universities</p>
<p>The content is divided into four points.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has repeatedly urged private universities in each province and city to submit their registration for record within a specified period. For the sake of caution, the ministry has formulated standards for universities to apply for registration, which are divided into four points: (1) The deadline for private universities in Beijing to apply for registration is from now until the end of August. If they still have not submitted their registration for record within this period, they will be ordered to suspend operations and enrollment. (2) For private universities in provinces outside Beijing, if transportation is convenient and investigations are unhindered, the deadline is also from now until the end of September. (3) Provinces such as Xinjiang and Chahar, and other remote areas where transportation is not fully developed, should be given special consideration, and the deadline should be extended to the end of this year. For the above two measures, if the deadline is reached and the registration has not been submitted, they will also be ordered to suspend operations. (4) When private universities apply for registration, they must first report to the school's board of directors for record, and then the school's board of directors will report to the ministry. The ministry will appoint specialists to conduct detailed inspections and report back to the ministry for strict review before making a decision.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Department</h3>

It is also heard that the quota will be relaxed to create more opportunities.</p>
<h3>Lida Academy</h3>
<h3>New Plan for Rural Education Department in High School</h3>
<p>The high school department of Jiangwan Lida Academy added a rural education department last year. The curriculum organization and training methods are very different from general high school normal departments and rural normal schools. There are three characteristics: (1) To develop rural education, one should start with improving the rural economy. The path that students in this department will take in the future is to attach literacy education to the cooperative movement and then carry out primary school education. (2) The so-called rural education is by no means limited to teaching reading, let alone teaching rural children to read. Students in this department will be responsible for guiding and helping farmers in all aspects of life. (3) Students in this department will never rely on teaching income to make a living, but will have various skills to make a living in rural areas. Serving the countryside is their duty, not a means of livelihood. Although they are responsible for guiding and helping farmers, they themselves are still a part of the farmers, and are by no means a class higher or different from the farmers. Therefore, students in this department attach equal importance to productive skills and academic cultivation. Since the beginning of this semester, class time has been allocated according to work time. For the next semester, there are even more ambitious new plans. The school has found 60 acres of farmland in the countryside of Nanxiang, and the second grade of the department will move there to operate. Recently, the school authorities have worked hard to create a budget that is extremely affordable. Next semester, the second grade students of the department only need to raise 55 yuan for living expenses and tuition, and 159 yuan for production funds. In the future, they can permanently use the production profits to supply all their own (at least their own) expenses, without having to pay another cent. Moreover, if they want to leave the group upon graduation, the 159 yuan they previously paid can be returned. As for its organization, it is purely teacher-student joint production and joint consumption. Its production activities are farming, raising chickens, raising ducks, beekeeping, and raising fish. According to this plan, aside from other things, the problems of life and schooling that are most distressing to young people will surely be solved to a considerable extent. It is not difficult to further solve the problem of lifelong career. If this kind of education is a great success, what will be its impact on the country and society? It is heard that the school plans to make a detailed report to the education community after a half-year trial run for research.</p>
<h3>East China Summer School Opens</h3>

<p>Special Issue on Cooperative Movement</p>
<h3>Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Will</h3>
<p>For forty years I have dedicated myself to the cause of the National Revolution, the aim of which is to secure freedom and equality for China. Forty years of experience have convinced me that to achieve this goal, it is imperative to awaken the people and unite with those nations of the world that treat us on an equal footing to struggle together. The Revolution has not yet succeeded. Let all our comrades follow the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, Outlines of National Reconstruction, the Three Principles of the People, and the Manifesto of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, and continue their efforts to bring them to complete realization. In particular, it is my heartfelt hope that our recent proposals for a National Convention and the abolition of unequal treaties shall be brought about as soon as possible. This is my earnest instruction.</p>
<h3>A Simple Explanation of the Cooperative Movement</h3>
<p>(1) The cooperative movement is a new global economic organizational movement. It aims to remedy the defects of modern economic organizations that focus solely on profit-making through the organization of cooperatives. This is achieved by linking producers and consumers directly, thereby eliminating the parasitic profits of merchants, preventing producers from being manipulated and oppressed, and preventing consumers from being exploited. It also aims to eliminate commercial warfare, prevent large enterprises from monopolizing, reconcile labor-capital conflicts, reduce high-interest loans, and equitably distribute economic profits through peaceful, thrifty, fair, independent, and mutual aid methods.</p>
<p>(2) The cooperative movement can unite the national spirit. The greatest defect of the Chinese nation is its historical fragmentation. Therefore, to restore the nation's inherent strength and promote a noble national consciousness, it is essential to start with unity. Engaging in cooperative endeavors can achieve the benefits of unity and, invisibly, cultivate a spirit of independence, mutual assistance, shared values, and shared hardships, greatly aiding in uniting the nation. (3) The cooperative movement can promote the development of civil rights. The development of civil rights must begin with training. Therefore, the initial step in civil rights is "no success without assembly." Within a cooperative, "power" is in the hands of the members, and "ability" is entrusted to specialists elected by the members. The "one person, one vote" system of cooperatives embodies the spirit of people's livelihood. Its situation is similar to the separation of powers in a nation. Therefore, the practice gained from working within a cooperative can provide training for exercising the four rights of election, recall, initiative, and referendum, making it a good method for promoting the realization of democracy. (4) The cooperative movement is the first step in realizing the Principle of People's Livelihood. The purpose of the cooperative movement is to aim for the people's self-sufficiency, unlike the capitalist pursuit of profit. It aims to build an equal, fair, people-nourishing, and conscious economic organization through a defined plan. Its purpose aligns with the Principle of People's Livelihood. However, the Principle of People's Livelihood leverages political power, using laws and regulations to suppress the manipulation by landlords and capitalists and to protect the rights of farmers and laborers. The cooperative movement is purely an effort by the people themselves, solely focusing on economic organization. While the methods are slightly different, the economic power gained by the people themselves through the cooperative movement can support political power and promote the success of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Therefore, the cooperative movement is the first step in realizing the Principle of People's Livelihood, and the cooperative movement can only succeed under the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. This is to make cooperation aligned with the Principle of People's Livelihood, not to make the Principle of People's Livelihood cooperative. (5) The cooperative movement is the foundation for establishing local autonomy. Local autonomy is the organization by which local people manage their own political and economic affairs. Experience from cooperative endeavors can cultivate the concepts of self-help, self-reliance, and self-defense, which can form the foundation of autonomy. Therefore, the Premier stipulated in the Local Autonomy Implementation Law that autonomous bodies should promote cooperative enterprises. Now, as preparations are underway for local autonomy, the cooperative movement should be promoted to support and advance each other. (6) The cooperative movement can alleviate the suffering of farmers. Farmers account for over 80% of the national population in China. Besides the difficulties in obtaining loans, which affect the hardship of daily life, the greatest suffering lies in the fact that tillers do not own their land. Therefore, in the Premier's equalization of land rights, in addition to formulating laws to restrict, protect, and reward, there are also provisions to assist farmers in purchasing land so that "tillers own their land." The function of the cooperative, *</p>
<p>is to use the spirit of coordination and collaboration, (1) Apply consumer cooperatives so that farmers can purchase daily necessities directly from producers or wholesalers, avoiding the profits gained by merchants through resale and saving on daily expenses. (2) Apply supply cooperatives so that farmers can jointly purchase fertilizers, seeds, and tools to enhance technological efficiency and increase production capacity. (3) Apply sales cooperatives so that farmers can sell directly, avoiding merchants' exploitation and manipulation, and increasing the price of production. (4) Apply manufacturing cooperatives to enable farmers to jointly manufacture agricultural products that must be manufactured by machines, such as cheese, to increase daily income. (5) Apply credit cooperatives to circulate assets, enabling farmers to improve their daily lives and obtain capital to purchase land, so that tillers own their land. (7) The cooperative movement is a movement to liberate workers and small merchants. Workers also suffer from a lack of capital, making it nearly impossible to maintain even the minimum standard of living. Therefore, the Premier stipulated maximum and minimum wages, formulated factory management laws, established labor insurance systems, and adopted profit-sharing systems to aid workers. However, these are all legal regulations and equal assistance. If the cooperative movement is engaged in and each individual strives for liberation, the results will undoubtedly be faster because production cooperatives can make workers co-owners of factory machinery and all production tools, construction cooperatives can allow workers to become co-owners of real estate, and consumer cooperatives can allow workers to change</p>
<p>in addition to improving daily life, they can also become shareholders and co-owners of savings in the community. Other small merchants in cities suffer economic disorganization no less than farmers and workers. Therefore, cooperatives can also be organized to avoid the oppression of large stores and reduce the cost of purchasing goods, thereby generating more capital to improve their lives.</p>
<h3>The Three Principles of the People and the Cooperative Movement</h3>
<p>By Tao Qiqing Everyone knows that the Three Principles of the People are based on benevolence and aim to "regard the world as one community." The promotion of the cooperative movement is to overthrow the exploitation of speculative and monopolistic enterprises, and further, to overthrow the oppression of capitalism. This is based on benevolence. The true meaning of cooperation, "Each for all, all for each," is to advocate egoism on the one hand and altruism on the other. It truly aligns with the "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" ideal of "regarding the world as one community." Therefore, the promotion of the cooperative movement is an essential path to achieving the implementation of the Three Principles of the People. The cooperative movement aims to solve the crux of economic problems, change the existing economic system, and aim for shared ownership. It is closely related to the Principle of People's Livelihood. However, after a slight elaboration on the principles and functions of cooperation, it is deeply felt that the cooperative movement is also closely related to the Principle of Nationalism and the Principle of Democracy and can assist in their realization. The relationship between the cooperative movement and the Three Principles of the People is described below. (1) Nationalism and the Cooperative Movement. The most important mission of nationalism is to resist imperialism. The tools of imperialists to invade weak nations are political power and economic power, with political power as an auxiliary and economic power as the main force. Especially after the European War, the aggressive policies of various imperialists have been based solely on economics. Within weak nations themselves, the comprador class and quasi-comprador class are at the disposal of imperialists, helping them do evil. Because of the manipulation and exploitation of the comprador class and quasi-comprador class, the poisonous flames of imperialist economic aggression have spread endlessly. The cooperative movement takes it as its destiny to overthrow the exploiting and monopolizing parasites. Once the evil comprador class is eliminated domestically, the economic aggression of imperialists will have lost a major arm. Oppressed nations, without internal collaborators "acting as accomplices," will make it difficult for imperialist aggression to harm them. This is the realm where nationalism achieves success.</p>
<p>(2) Democracy and the Cooperative Movement. The most important mission of the Principle of Democracy is to implement a democratic centralized political system. Only when politics achieves a democratic centralized system can it be considered the true spirit of democracy. The representative political systems of Europe and the United States exercise indirect democracy, and as a result, they have become capitalist political systems. Therefore, the essence of the Principle of Democracy is to cultivate democratic forces, use democratic forces to achieve centralization, and then use democratic forces to exercise their political power to manage the government's governing power. This democratic force is based on the people. As for the organization of the cooperative system, it is absolutely based on people and not on capital. This is a pure democratic spirit, which is in line with the essence of the Principle of Democracy. Economic organizations and all other organizations should be based entirely on people and not on other things. This is when the Principle of Democracy enters the realm of success.</p>
<p>(3) The Principle of People's Livelihood and the Cooperative Movement. The implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood requires controlling capital and equalizing land rights. The Premier believed that the Chinese people only have a distinction between the very poor and the slightly poor, and that there is no emergence of a capitalist class. For preventive purposes, on the one hand, private capital should not be allowed to develop to a harmful degree, and on the other hand, state capital should be developed for the purpose of benefiting the people. These two types of capital control are the so-called sharing of future production. The meaning of cooperation is to prevent the evils of capitalism and to socialize production and distribution with shared ownership as its main purpose. Therefore, Mr. Xue Xianzhou believed that the fundamental method of controlling capital should start with the people themselves, and there is no better way than cooperation. The Premier also believed that China's land, affected by the development of industry and commerce, would harm people's livelihood due to land rights, and advocated the equalization of land rights. The purpose of this equalization of land rights is to ensure that tillers own their land. To achieve this goal, Mr. Xue Xianzhou also told us, "There is no better way than cooperation." In the beginning, land was publicly owned, and there was no so-called land right. Later, with the development of private land ownership, farmers' land was gradually plundered, creating landlords who enjoyed happiness and causing social injustice due to land. The spirit of cooperation is to overthrow parasitic policies in society, advocate the spirit of collaboration and cooperation, and apply it to specific practical methods such as "saving daily expenses," "increasing daily income," and "circulating funds" to help farmers obtain capital and purchase land. This assists in the implementation of the equalization of land rights, including taxation based on assessed value and increased value accruing to the public. The cooperative movement is not only closely related to the Principle of People's Livelihood but also sufficient to assist in its implementation.</p>
<p>Under the current trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap, with rice as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, and prices soaring, the people's lives are becoming increasingly precarious. The reason for this is mostly due to imperialists, international capitalists, and the domestic comprador class. The urgent need to promote the cooperative movement is not only to assist in the realization of the Three Principles of the People but also to alleviate the current suffering of the people.</p>

<h3>The Theory of the Cooperative Movement by Jueren</h3>
<p>Speaking of "cooperation" in a broad sense, humans cannot achieve their various goals in isolation, like Robinson Crusoe stranded on a desert island. They must rely on the cooperation of their peers because individual strength is inherently very weak. By gathering many individuals and uniting them, they can develop the necessary practical abilities. If we simply look at the organization and activities of modern labor unions, we can learn a great lesson. Even laborers with only "crude knowledge and nothingness" can become a great force once united. They not only cultivate a spirit of autonomy but also receive knowledge training. In the primitive era of mankind, there were countless examples of relying on the power of unity to resist foreign insults and seek survival. Therefore, collaboration is an extremely important thing for mankind. Since the existence of mankind, cooperation has existed for a long time. The entire development of mankind can ultimately be said to depend on how cooperation and unity are determined.</p>
<p>As for what the fundamental ideology of cooperation is, this question is difficult to answer simply and concisely. First, because the issues included in cooperation are very broad. Economic issues are certainly the main issues, but other issues include politics, ethics, philosophy, art, and other aspects. Second, because there are many factions of cooperation. In terms of color, there is red cooperation and yellow cooperation. In terms of national boundaries, there is British-style cooperation and Belgian-style cooperation. Because their ideal future societies are different, the concepts of cooperation are inconsistent. Moreover, the classification of cooperation is very complicated, and each type of cooperative has its own characteristics. It is extremely difficult to synthesize various cooperations into a definition without committing the two shortcomings of generalization and prejudice. In the past, the definition of cooperation was "Each for all, all for each." Some people translated it as "Each for the whole, the whole for each," which is too vague and easily leads to misunderstandings. Now, some people translate it as "I for everyone, everyone for me," which is relatively better. However, such a sentence is not very clear or perfect to explain cooperation. Now, we try to define cooperation as follows: "A cooperative is a free union of mutual assistance formed by people with weak economic power. There is no limit to the number of its members. Its purpose is based on the equal rights and self-help principles of its members, in order to completely improve their economic and moral status. It operates all enterprises under joint calculation and with the purpose of abolishing profits. The benefits generated by economic enterprises are not based on the amount of capital but are distributed according to the amount required by the joint operation."</p>
<p>We see the shortcomings of the current economic organization, and our demand for the cooperative movement is even more urgent. Cooperation recognizes that consumption is the cause and production is the result, consumption is the purpose and production is the means, and consumption is based on the desires of consumers. That is, consumption is for satisfying desires. Therefore, the cooperative economic organization is not only not for profit but also based on "the needs of consumers and society."</p>
<p>Regardless of which country's population, the laboring class always accounts for the largest part, and the laboring class is all consumers. If, one day, the cooperative system is implemented nationwide, the things we consume are all produced by ourselves, and all commercial, industrial, and agricultural organizations are in the hands of cooperatives. Think about it, wouldn't the master of society at this time still be the laboring class?</p>
<p>If the economic system is organized in the interests of producers, as it is now, capital will be the master of society one day, and workers will only be a secondary machine. Conversely, if one day the economic system is rebuilt on consumption and based on the interests of consumers, then the needs of each individual and the majority of the masses will be the supreme masters of society.</p>
<p>Workers are unfortunately in a hired position, selling their physical strength to others in exchange for work, and they must depend on the capitalists for their livelihood and listen to their commands. Because there are more and more people seeking work, the power of workers becomes weaker and weaker, and capitalists can choose the best and pick and choose at will. If workers come forward as consumers, the situation is very different. The more people there are, the greater the power, and the final victory always belongs to the workers.</p>
<p>Dr. Jin William, a scholar of cooperation, told us, "When the capital in the cooperative is sufficiently accumulated, it can buy land, and members can live in it, cultivate it themselves, manufacture it themselves, and all the necessities are sufficient for self-sufficiency."</p>
<p>From the above words, the capital, production tools, land, etc., in the cooperative are of course owned by all members. If it is expanded, when the whole society is cooperatized, then the equipment of the society</p>
<p>All production equipment is owned by the entire society. This is the socialization of the elements of production. Therefore, the initial step of the cooperative movement is to help the weak and resist the exploitation of capitalists, while preventing the development of private capital, and the ultimate goal is to fundamentally eliminate the private ownership of the means of production so that the means of production are used to drive the needs of the entire society and not be used by a few people.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the consciousness of economic organizations, cooperators recognize that desires gradually evolve with the evolution of the times. In the era of hunting and nomadic, there were not many products and desires were not very developed. In the agricultural era, the products also increased greatly and the desires also increased. Therefore, at that time, production and consumption could still be balanced and human desires could be satisfied. Later, in the commercial era, great changes took place in the economic organization. Due to the invention of machinery and the concentration of capital, large-scale production and a system of distribution based on exchange were formed. As a result, on the one hand, production increased sharply and increased beyond the needs of society, and economic panics often occurred. On the other hand, people without purchasing power were unable to allocate products and could not even guarantee their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Professor Jid of France said, "If the cooperative system is implemented, the quantity produced by producers will increase or decrease according to everyone's needs. Except for various unexpected errors that are unavoidable for everyone, it will inevitably ensure that production is neither too much nor too little, and that production and consumption are compatible."</p>
<p>Summarizing the above, the purpose of cooperation is first to ensure mutual protection among members, second to obtain the comfort of life, and third to obtain the independence and security of life. That is to say, under the cooperative system, society is responsible for protecting and treating all members of society equally.</p>
<p>The cooperative movement is like the Principle of People's Livelihood of our party, which is to build a conscious common society and overthrow the anarchic economic organization.</p>
<p>Because the most effective way to implement the socialization of distribution is through cooperatives, promoting the cooperative movement has become one of the main policies in the Kuomintang's policies.</p>

<p>Cooperative Movement</p>
<p>First Day of Propaganda Week</p>
<p>Propaganda Rally Yesterday</p>
<p>Arts and Entertainment Rally Tonight</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week Preparatory Committee, jointly organized by the city's party and government agencies, believes that the cooperative movement is important and to arouse the public to promote cooperative enterprises. It was decided to hold a cooperative movement propaganda rally at 9 a.m. yesterday in the city's party headquarters auditorium. Notices were sent in advance to the city's party and government agencies and various public organizations, requesting them to send representatives to the meeting. More than 500 people attended the meeting. First, Chairman Chen Dezheng reported on the meaning of the cooperative movement, followed by cooperative experts Wang Shiying and Zhang Tinghao, who gave speeches one after another. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Meeting Order (1) Opening of the meeting, (2) Singing the Party song, (3) Paying the highest respects to the Party and national flag and the Premier's portrait, (4) Chairman respectfully reading the Premier's will, (5) Chairman's report, (6) Speeches, (7) Proposals, (8) Calling out slogans, (9) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report Comrades, representatives, today is the first day of the Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week jointly prepared by the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government. A propaganda rally is held here, and several gentlemen who are particularly interested in cooperative undertakings and have profound research in cooperative ventures are invited to give speeches on the theories, principles, methods, and effects of cooperation. We all feel extremely painful now, especially in the current trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap. Prices are high, and the conditions of life in all aspects have also increased. Let's put aside the others for the time being and just talk about rice. Now the source of rice is not sufficient, and the price of rice has increased due to the influence of gold being expensive and silver being cheap, but in fact, I know that there is rice stored in Shanghai. The price of rice sold in Shanghai now should not be so high. Originally, the price of foreign rice was only about 14 or 15 yuan, but now it is selling for more than 20 yuan. This is because a large group of rice traders are making money there. The economic power of the general poor is very weak. At this time, they will certainly suffer a lot. In normal times, people often suffer great losses for nothing due to the exploitation of traders. Among these many lessons, the cooperative movement and cooperative enterprises need to be promoted because cooperation can eliminate the monopoly, manipulation, exploitation, and extortion of general intermediaries. When the economic situation is so bad, the cooperative movement and cooperative enterprises can indeed be regarded as a very effective relief method. Of course, we are not saying that the entire people's livelihood problem can be solved by cooperation because the Premier has a very good way to show us the entire people's livelihood problem, and it would be an underestimation of the people's livelihood problem to solve it with the cooperative movement. But we can believe that in solving the problem of people's livelihood, the cooperative movement is indeed a very effective and powerful help. Before the Premier's Principle of People's Livelihood is realized, when the social and economic situation is so dangerous now, and when the livelihood of the general people is so withered and so difficult, we have to value this cooperative enterprise and take it as our current important work. Not only do we have to promote the importance of the cooperative enterprise, but we also have to implement the cooperative enterprise. In Shanghai, the simplicity of money</p>
<p>has become an omnipotent place. There are many who do evil with gold and silver, but there are also many who are slaughtered for the sake of money. In this kind of place, where the environment is so dangerous, it is more necessary to promote cooperative enterprises, and it is more necessary to promote the cooperative movement. Therefore, the city's party and government agencies jointly held the Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week. Regarding the theoretical aspects of cooperation, the experts on cooperation today can give detailed explanations. In addition to thanking these experts, we hope that the comrades who are present will be able to work together to develop this cooperative enterprise so that the cooperative enterprise will have great progress in this city in the shortest possible time. This is the significance of holding today's propaganda rally. This time we are holding the Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week, it is definitely not just a few words, but to make the general public understand, not only to understand, but also to actually promote cooperative enterprises. The report is over.</p>
<p>Expert Speeches After the Chairman's report, cooperative experts Wang Shiying, Zhang Tinghao, and others gave detailed speeches on the points to be noted in organizing cooperatives, as well as general theories, principles, and methods. Due to the length of the speeches, they are omitted.</p>

Among the self-funded students, dozens have abandoned their studies and returned home due to the sudden rise in the Japanese gold price. Chinese laborers residing in Japan, such as those engaged in the umbrella industry, catering, kimono, and barbering, have become unemployed due to the gold price surge and have no means of livelihood. The Japanese authorities have already repatriated them in two batches. The second batch, consisting of more than 300 people, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The situation at that time is described below:</p>
<p>Quota for Unemployment Repatriation: Last month, Japanese authorities negotiated with our consulates in Nagasaki and Yokohama to repatriate unemployed Chinese workers in Japan, stating that at least 500 people must be sent back within half a month. The first batch of 40 people was repatriated on June 28th, transported to Shanghai by the Japanese ship Asamaru, all disembarking from Yokohama. Yesterday was the arrival of the second batch, and a third batch will be sent next week. Before July 15th, all 500 Chinese will be sent to Shanghai. The second batch has arrived in Shanghai. The second batch of Chinese repatriated from Japan, still boarding from Yokohama, consists of more than 300 unemployed Chinese merchants and laborers. Xu Xitong was elected as the leader of the Chinese unemployed returning home group. The repatriation procedures were handled through negotiations between our consulate in Yokohama and the Japanese Maritime Police Department. The Taiyo Maru of the Japanese Postal Company provided steerage and took care of them along the way, with Mr. Xu in charge. They departed from Japan on June 30th and arrived in Shanghai on the 4th. The group of more than 300 people all disembarked at the Huishan Wharf. Suffering in Japan: The majority of the Chinese repatriated this time are from Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, most of whom are engaged in the paper umbrella business, including shop owners and employees. According to the Chinese, some of them went to Japan five or six years ago, each bringing capital of no less than six or seven hundred yuan. They opened small shops in Chiba, Kanagawa, Gunma, and Koizumi to sell paper umbrellas and other goods. There was also a group working in copperware factories in Takaoka City. This time, affected by the gold price surge, their capital was almost completely lost, and the copper factories also laid off all the Chinese workers, leading to them being stranded in Japan, facing difficult living conditions. Recently, the cost of living in Japan has soared. Each person needs at least 1.4 to 1.5 yuan per day, leading to them pawning everything. If they did not return home, the situation would have been unbearable. This is because various industries in Japan are contracting, and the exclusion of Chinese is particularly severe.</p>
<p>More Arrivals Expected Today: There are also more than ten Chinese kimono shops that have gone bankrupt in this gold price surge. Most of these Chinese are from Fujian, and there are sixteen of them. They may arrive in Shanghai today on the Shizuoka Maru. According to the Chinese returning home, after staying in Shanghai for a few days, they have decided to return to their hometowns in eastern Zhejiang, vowing never to go to Japan again, suffering oppression and destruction from foreigners, and are willing to return home, cultivate fields, and live a hard rural life. It is also said that the prices of various goods in Japan have risen by more than 40% after the silver price plummeted. Wine that previously sold for four yuan now costs seven yuan.</p>
<h3>French Company Water and Electricity Workers</h3>
<p>Resume Work on Monday</p>
<p>Because One Worker Has Not Yet Been Released</p>
<p>The French company water and electricity workers' strike has had hope of resolution after much mediation. Work was originally scheduled to resume yesterday morning, but because one worker, Song Youxin, who was previously detained by the Public Security Bureau of the Second District, has not yet been released, and Song is currently in the local court, bail cannot be granted without procedures. The strike committee resolved that work could not resume until Song was released, so there was not enough time to handle it. Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, the mediator specially sent Mr. Yang and Mr. Cui directly to the labor union to invite representatives to talk. The labor union sent four people to the mediator's office. After the mediator's earnest persuasion, they were ordered to resume work first thing tomorrow (Monday), and were told not to wait and see and cause further complications. All the preconditions will be guaranteed and properly negotiated by me, etc. The four representatives were very grateful for their enthusiastic assistance and have agreed to resume work tomorrow. If there are no other problems, it can be formally resolved.</p>
<h3>National Tax Standardization Conference</h3>
<p>Date of the General Assembly Set</p>
<p>General Assembly on August 15th</p>
<p>The Continental News Agency reports that the National Tax Standardization Conference was originally scheduled to open on the first of last month, but because only a few representatives from various provinces reported, it could not open as scheduled. It is now learned that representatives from fifteen provinces have reported, and representatives who have not yet arrived have also submitted proposals and opinions. Therefore, at yesterday's fourth preparatory meeting, there were more representatives attending than before. During the meeting, there was an in-depth discussion on the implementation and remedies of tax standardization. Furthermore, because tax standardization affairs urgently need to be implemented, it was decided by public vote that the date of the General Assembly will be August 15th.</p>
<p>The Shuntien News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance is actively promoting tax standardization, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance is handling it according to the resolution of the Tax Standardization Committee of the July 17th Finance Conference, the General Outline for Tax Standardization and Conversion to Special Consumption Tax, and has issued a notice to the provinces for implementation, without drafting another plan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai International Settlement Police Department</h3>
<p>Electrical Inspection of Pedestrians</p>
<p>Latest Invention, a Powerful Weapon</p>
<p>Can Make Thieves Tremble</p>
<p>The New China News Agency reports that the Shanghai International Settlement Public Works Department Police Department, in response to the rampant thieves in the Settlement, which are making pedestrians afraid, has invented a powerful weapon for inspecting pedestrians using electricity. The device is divided into two parts, resembling two boxes, containing positive and negative electrical machines and electric bells. Two wires connect to the main line on the road. If a pedestrian has iron objects or weapons such as pistols hidden on their person, the machine will sound automatically. At 9:00 PM the night before last, the Western Detective Chief of the General Patrol Room supervised all the detectives and went to the Xinzha Bridge to conduct a trial. The electrical boxes were placed on the east and west sides of the bridge approach and connected to the overhead wires. At that time, two men resembling workers passed by the area, and the electrical machine suddenly rang loudly. The Western Detective Chief stepped forward to search and found two pistols. Detectives were dispatched to take them to the Xinzha Police Station for questioning. It was found that this type of electrical machine is extremely light and portable and can be moved at any time. In the future, clearing out bandits in various parts of the Settlement will be as easy as turning one's hand over.</p>

We all have many feelings when we look back on the past year. I hope that the various bureaus and the Municipal Government will bring the past to a close, set a direction for the future, and pay particular attention to financial matters, which are especially important. (2) The most important point to note in the 19th year is that the Municipal Organization Law has been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be implemented in the city. Organizations such as districts, neighborhoods, lanes, and alleys must be completed within the prescribed time limit. Now, according to the previous resolution, personnel have been designated to form the Municipal Organization Law Implementation Preparatory Committee, which has already held one meeting. The mission undertaken by this committee is very important, so I hope that the committee members in attendance will pay special attention, and that the heads of the various bureaus who are not in attendance will also contribute their opinions as much as possible, so as to make it perfect and hope to achieve it as soon as possible. (3) Starting from the 19th year, I will personally go to the various bureaus and participate in memorial weeks in rotation. I will notify you again when the dates are set. (4) The military news from the front is absolutely inconsistent with the rumors from the outside world. Currently, the main force has reached the decisive battle period on the Longhai Line, so I am confident that there will be a satisfactory resolution soon. I hope that my colleagues will correct any unconscious rumors at any time. 2. Secretary-General's Report: (1) The revised Article 4, Clause 9 of the Shanghai Municipal Industrial and Commercial Group Registration Regulations, and the progress of reporting to the Executive Yuan for explanation.

It is currently being studied. (3) The Huizhang Bureau has been taken over for half a year.

<h3>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association</h3>
<p>Requests to Prepare for the Establishment of a Rayon Factory</p>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association recently followed the resolution of the emergency general meeting and telegraphed the National Government, requesting to prepare for the establishment of a national rayon factory. The telegram stated: "Since foreign merchants have imported rayon silks and satins into our country, our silk manufacturers' real silk silks and satins are no match in terms of brilliance. The sales channels have been seized, and there is no way to resist. We have to seize the opportunity to use and transform real silk and rayon interwoven products.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>They immediately felt that they were beautiful and eye-catching enough to compete with foreign goods and avoid danger. In recent years, the scope of rayon fabrics has become wider and wider, and the demand has become more and more intense. Our eastern neighbor, Japan, has set up factories everywhere to manufacture rayon silks and satins, exporting them without tax and selling them in China to compete with China silk. The amount is so large that it is shocking, forming the largest leak in our country in recent times. In today's China, which is known for its poverty and weakness, if we do not find a way to imitate and manufacture, allowing it to absorb the economy endlessly, the consequences will be unimaginable. The taxes on China silk are layered upon layers, far exceeding the heavy taxes and rising prices of Japanese rayon. The cost of China silk is higher than that of Japanese silk, which has low taxes. The raw materials for rayon are mostly hemp, seaweed, and the like. Can it be that our coastal and inland areas do not have them? However, the machinery is complex and the manufacturing method is exquisite. The needs of a factory often cost tens of millions. This kind of financial strength is not something that the masses can afford. This is what we should ask the National Government to approve and adopt and quickly prepare for. Moreover, there are more and more unemployed people everywhere. The strong take risks and gather in the mountains, hindering law and order and endangering the foundation of the country. If the National Government establishes a national rayon factory in a suitable place, it can at least help a small number of unemployed people. Afterwards, there will be less and less foreign rayon and more and more domestic rayon. Factories will be added at any time as needed, and silk and satin will also be able to maintain their existence. Then, the number of unemployed people will inevitably decrease day by day, until there are none. This is to relieve the suffering of the people's livelihood, and we should ask the National Government to set up a factory to manufacture. The Association believes that rayon has become an indispensable raw material for our country's silk weaving industry in recent years. The demand is becoming more and more intense. At this time, when gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and the value of foreign goods is increasing day by day, this huge leak should be plugged quickly. There is no other way than to set up a factory to manufacture it ourselves. Therefore, at the emergency meeting of the two provinces on June 22nd, a unanimous vote was taken to request the National Government to prepare for the establishment of a national rayon factory, etc. Accordingly, we respectfully telegraph to ask the government to adopt our humble opinion and approve its implementation, so as to save the decline of the silk industry, relieve the suffering of the people's livelihood, and benefit both the national economy and the people's livelihood. We cannot express our anticipation and gratitude enough, and we pray for instructions to follow. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association bows."</p>
<h3>Protest Against the Recovery of Telephone Rights</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Deutsche Telephone Company passed the sale, the whole country has unanimously opposed it. The transportation authorities, in order to facilitate contact with all parties, specially dispatched the company director Zhuang Zhihuan to Shanghai last month. According to Mr. Zhuang, the telephone company has been accused of transferring its franchise to a new company. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already filed a protest and expressed a declaration. As for other aspects, they are still actively proceeding at the moment, and will have a close discussion with the leaders of all circles in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Zhu Peide, Chief of Staff of the National Government, left Beijing by night train the night before last. Those who came with him included Zheng Hongnian, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce, and Yang Xingfo, President of the Academia Sinica, etc.</p>
<h3>The Rumor of Wei Daoming's Resignation is Untrue</h3>
<p>When Nanjing Mayor Wei Daoming recently came to Shanghai, someone asked him if the rumor of his resignation was true. He said that it was purely a groundless rumor, and he dismissed such rumors with a smile.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bridge Repair</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Engineering Office, in order to ensure the safety of trains, specially dispatched track inspectors, who found that the steel rails and wooden sleepers laid on Bridges Nos. 104, 105, 109, 112, and 111 between Wangdian and Xiashi on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line were decayed due to years of disrepair, which is a matter of important traffic, so they need to send workers to repair them urgently. Therefore, at 4:25 PM yesterday, a special train of bridge repair workers was dispatched from the Zhakou Station, including one Class 12 large van, one third-class passenger car, one boxcar, one flatcar, and one crane. The engineer stationed in Hangzhou supervised the workers and brought the necessary tools and materials to Wangdian.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Prepares to Build Tap Water in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>Invites Merchants to Bid for Construction</p>
<p>The Municipal Government has announced that it is inviting merchants to bid for construction because there is still no tap water in the three districts of Western Shanghai: Pu, Song, Fahua, and Caojing. Here is an excerpt of its announcement and conditions:</p>

Merchants are now specially invited to bid for construction. Any citizens of this country who are interested in contracting should go to the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau at the west end of the new West District Municipal Government Road before September 30th to obtain a copy of the instructions and drawings. This is hereby announced. Conditions for the Bidding Method for the Construction of Tap Water in Western Shanghai: Build your own water plant or transfer water from other tap water plants. Attachment: Note. Minimum capital amount: National currency 6 million yuan, or national currency 4 million yuan. Longest patent term: 25 years, or 20 years.

Remuneration for two years is exempt. Also, those who obtain a copy of the instructions and drawings must pay five yuan each.</p>
<h3>Overseas Mail</h3>
<p>Postage Often Insufficient</p>
<p>Therefore, Easily Leads to Delays</p>
<p>It is reported that the Shanghai Postal Authority said that since the postage rates for mail sent abroad were increased, although advertisements have been published in newspapers and notices have been posted in various post offices, there are still about 3,000 letters per day with postage stamps affixed according to the old postage rates. As a result, before these mails are delivered, the recipient must be charged twice the amount of the deficiency in postage, and this easily leads to delays.</p>
<h3>The Wage Increase Movement of Rice Boat Partners Resolved</h3>
<p>The partners of the Shanghai Out-of-Door Rice Transport Boat Owners, due to the low wages and insufficient income, launched a request to the boat owners to increase wages, and requested that if the boat partners are injured on duty or encounter robbery and damage to life, all hospital medical expenses shall be borne by the boat owners. Representatives were elected to request various gang boat owners. This matter has been going on for two months, and passenger boats have all agreed to increase, but self-sale boats mostly refuse to increase. The representatives investigated the boat owners who refused to increase and negotiated with them repeatedly. The boat owners cited slow business as an excuse. Recently, all the boats that have not increased wages have arrived in Shanghai with cargo. The representatives invited the boat owners to a meeting, and the representatives informed them of the difficult living conditions of the partners. The various gang boat owners have now agreed and signed the books to resolve the issue.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Detective Captain Qi Jie Resigns</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, due to insufficient funds, has greatly reduced the number of police officers in order to save money. Now, Qi Jie, the captain of the bureau's detective team, also voluntarily resigned the day before yesterday, and Director Shen has approved the order. Yesterday, Mr. Qi had submitted the official documents of the cases handled by the team to Director Shen for review.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Federation</h3>
<p>Requests to Reduce Overseas Chinese Mail Postage</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation telegraphed the Nanjing National Government Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Shanghai Postal General Bureau yesterday: "Recently, we approved the Shantou Wholesale Industry Association's winter telegram, opening that Shantou suddenly announced an increase in fees for overseas Chinese remittances. Siam will still be charged an additional 50% by weight, and Japan and Annam will be charged an additional five cents per letter, which is half a jiao, an unreasonably harsh practice. The All-Chinese Federation has been negotiating, and the ink is not yet dry, but now they are using the small problem of remittances to increase postage. The special circumstances of overseas Chinese cannot be combined with ordinary mail. The old postage rates in various ports are already high, and cannot be increased again. Please strive to recover the decree from the Ministry of Transportation. Ten thousand prayers, Shantou Wholesale Industry Association bows winter print, etc. The Ministry of Transportation announced that it would increase the cost of letters sent to foreign countries by 50% from July 1st due to the rising gold exchange rate. However, overseas Chinese mail has special circumstances and should be an exception. The original chapter for overseas Chinese mail from French Indochina was one jiao per piece, which is already doubled compared to the five cents per piece for overseas Chinese mail from British colonies. If it is increased by five cents again, it will be doubled again, which the overseas Chinese cannot afford. Since the postage from British colonies has been reduced, the remaining colonies are the same, and cannot be increased. This case is not related to the Postal Union, and the government should not increase the suffering of overseas Chinese for the sake of postage. An order should be immediately issued to exempt overseas Chinese mail from the increase in postage for letters sent to foreign countries from July 1st, in order to relieve the hardships of overseas Chinese. Looking forward to implementation, ten thousand prayers, Overseas Chinese Federation Chairman Li Denghui, Business Committee Xu Jigong, Chen Zhiying, Liu Tumu, Situ Shangshen, etc. bow Jiang print.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Bureau Adds Shanghai Eastern Receiving Office</h3>
<p>In the eastern district of this port, factories are lined up and the number of merchants is increasing. All kinds of facilities should be available, but the telegraph bureau is still missing. If merchants in this area have telegrams to send, they must go to the Fuzhou Road Telegraph Bureau, which is not only far away and inconvenient, but also wastes time and delays important matters. In order to develop the telegraph business and facilitate merchants, the Ministry of Transportation has added a receiving machine at the Shanghai Bank Tilanqiao Branch at the intersection of Dongbailao Road and Maohai Road. The receiving clerk has arrived at the office to work. Merchants in the eastern district, who often have telegrams to send and receive, are all saying that it is convenient.</p>

<h3>Famous Amateur Actor</h3>
<p>Qiu Jianfei Kidnapped</p>
<p>Kidnapped by Ambush Gangsters After Leaving the Grand Theater</p>
<p>The Driver Was Forced Out of the Car Midway</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 1:20 AM, four gangsters with guns kidnapped Qiu Jianfei, a famous amateur actor, near the small garden across from the Grand Theater on Hankou Road in the Public Concession, and also kidnapped the driver Xu Guanbao. Xu was forced out of the car on Seymour Road in western Shanghai, and the car with the hostage disappeared at the same time. The reporter's investigation results are recorded below:</p>
<p>Qiu's Background: Qiu Jianfei, a famous amateur actor, whose courtesy name is Guoliang, is 35 years old and a native of Shanyin, Shaoxing. He currently resides at No. 721, Edward Road. He organized the Yongli Real Estate Company at home and owns a purple sedan, license number 42 in both the concession and the Chinese city. Qiu was previously an amateur actor at the Jiuji Society and has been with the Lühe Opera Association for several years. In addition to his mother, wife, and son, there is no one else at home. However, Qiu has a wide circle of friends and spends a lot of money, and most of his assets have been squandered. Drove to the Theater: The day before yesterday, a charity performance was held at the Grand Theater to raise funds for the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association. Celebrities from Shanghai, such as Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Yuan Lüdeng, Xie Baosheng, and Wang Xiaolai, were all enthusiastic about public welfare and performed on stage. Qiu, as one of the famous amateur actors, also participated. It was originally scheduled that yesterday he was to perform the martial play "Lion Tower". Qiu left home around 8:00 PM the night before, instructing his driver Xu Guansheng to drive his new No. 42 sedan to the Grand Theater to watch the performance.</p>
<p>Backstage Rehearsal: Qiu Jianfei is passionate about drama and spares no effort in studying martial arts. Since it was a gathering of celebrities that night, Qiu went to the backstage and talked eloquently. At around 11:00 PM, Qiu used the "Lion Tower", which was scheduled to be performed the next day, to practice in the alley behind the stage due to its martial arts nature, hoping that there would be no mistakes when he went on stage. Qiu originally had a self-defense pistol, but recently he found it annoying to carry it on his waist due to the hot weather. He had not used the gun for self-defense for several days. The night before, after watching the performance, Qiu waited for all the amateur actors to finish removing their makeup before walking out of the theater, which was already after 1:00 AM.</p>
<p>Suddenly Kidnapped: Qiu's driver Xu Guansheng parked the car in front of the small garden because the area in front of the Grand Theater was crowded with traffic and difficult to park. At this time, he saw his master walking over and was about to start the engine. As Qiu was about to enter the car door, a gangster suddenly grabbed the driver's hand and pointed a gun at Xu's waist, telling him not to make a sound. At the same time, three more gangsters rushed up, grabbed Qiu, and also threatened him with guns, pushing Qiu into the car. The hostage was outnumbered and left at the mercy of the gangsters. Then the gangsters sat in the car and drove west. The driver was also among those kidnapped. The Driver Was Driven Away: After the four gangsters kidnapped Qiu Jianfei and the driver Xu Guanbao, they drove west. They turned south on Xizang Road and entered Edward Road. When they reached the intersection of Seymour Road in western Shanghai, they drove the driver out of the car. The hostage and the car sped south on Avenue Joffre. Xu then hired a car to go to the Zhabei Concession police station to report his master's kidnapping. The police station received the news and immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to investigate, but they had already disappeared without a trace and could not be captured. As the reporter was writing, his No. 42 car had not yet been found. People say that Qiu is the shopkeeper of Tianbao Silver Store on the Great Road, but that is not true. Because the silver store was founded by people from Ningbo, while Qiu Jianfei is from Shaoxing. After a detailed investigation, they are completely unrelated.</p>

Unexpectedly, he was kidnapped again last night around 6:00 PM. Liu can also be said to be unlucky. Liu Nianchun owns a car, license number 157, which he uses for transportation when going out to do business every day. After lunch yesterday, he first went to Dingkang and returned home around 4:00 PM. In the evening at 6:00 PM, he ordered his driver Lu Asan to prepare the car outside the door, and then he and his wife, Ms. Ma, dressed up to go to the Bund Park to cool off. Who knew that after the couple boarded the car, four bandits suddenly emerged from the side of the road. Three of them were holding guns, jumped into the car, and two bandits pointed guns at the driver, ordering him not to make a sound. The other three bandits broke into the car and monitored Liu Nianchun and his wife, preventing them from shouting. Then the bandits drove the car and sped away. At the end of Gongping Road, where there were few people, the bandits drove Liu's wife, Ms. Ma, and the driver Asan out of the car, drove Liu away, and disappeared in an instant. The master and servant hired a car to return home. According to the report to the Xinzha police station, the police station immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate the scene.

<h3>Cheng Junpu's Wife</h3>
<p>Died Tragically from Abortion</p>
<p>Female Doctor Cheng Liqing Accused</p>
<p>The Greed for Profit Led to This Tragedy</p>
<p>Cheng Fled Immediately After Being Accused</p>
<p>Cheng Junpu, a native of Zhongshan County, Guangdong, residing at No. 100 Yuqing Lane, North Sichuan Road, now works at the Sincere Company. He has hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint with the Special District Local Court against Cheng Liqing, a Cantonese female doctor specializing in obstetrics and gynecology at the Guangdong Pharmacy on North Sichuan Road, for performing an abortion on his wife, resulting in her death. According to his statement, the plaintiff's wife, Huang Yixuan, had been married for ten years and had given birth to seven children. On June 7th, the plaintiff returned to Guangdong on business. Huang, fearing pregnancy because her menstrual period had been delayed for several weeks, consulted the defendant on the afternoon of June 9th. Unexpectedly, Cheng, greedy for profit and forgetting the harm, sought to obtain 100 yuan in medical expenses and administered strong medicine and washed Huang's uterus with surgery. By the next night, she was still bleeding and had a high fever. Her condition was critical, and the defendant was telegraphed to rescue her, but she refused to come. Reluctantly, she changed to Dr. Lu Baofa. Dr. Lu refused to treat her because her illness had reached a dangerous state and recommended her to the Dahua Hospital. She died on June 25th. The defendant, out of a moment of greed, committed this inhumane act. Her actions constitute the crime in the first half of Article 306, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. In addition to requesting punishment according to the law, he also filed a civil lawsuit to recover medical, funeral, and other expenses, etc. When the court issued a summons for investigation, Cheng Liqing had already fled after hearing the news. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun opened the court. The plaintiff, along with the deceased's nephew Cheng Yanqing and appraiser Lu Baofa, appeared in court to prove the previous situation and presented the records of Cheng's conversations with his aunt in the hospital. Judge Sun then ordered that the defendant be brought to court and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<h3>Russian Nude Female Corpse</h3>
<p>The Body Was Exceptionally Obese</p>
<p>There Was a Knife Wound of About an Inch on Her Face</p>
<p>The Murderer Has Been Arrested</p>
<p>A nameless Russian female corpse was found yesterday morning on the floor of a building at No. 218 Avenue Foch in the French Concession. After learning about it, the police station sent detectives to investigate. The corpse was about 30 years old, exceptionally obese, her hair had been cut off, and she was stark naked. Her nose was bleeding, and there was a knife wound of about an inch long on her right face. It was impossible to investigate the cause of death, and no family members were found. After the detectives returned to report to the police chief, he notified the Tongren Fuyuantang at 10:00 AM to send undertakers to take photos of the body at the morgue. Later, the police station notified the Western Benevolent Society in Shanghai to prepare a coffin for burial and transported it to the Hongqiao Cemetery in western Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Evening Post reported that at about 6:00 AM this morning, a Russian woman named Mi Kuoluofa at No. 118 Avenue Petain in the French Concession quarreled with her boyfriend Ji Xidufu after getting drunk and was killed. The murderer was arrested by nearby patrolmen and admitted to the crime. He is currently being detained at the police station pending trial.</p>
<h3>Seaside Construction Park</h3>
<p>Wusong is located on the seaside with excellent scenery, and the sails and cars are especially charming. In addition, the Jungong Road runs through Songhu, and steam trains come and go continuously, making transportation extremely convenient. Therefore, tourists come and go like a shuttle during the summer and autumn, but it is a great regret that there is no suitable park for tourists to rest. Tang Chengzong and Liu Ziwen of the Wusong Municipal Committee, in view of the above situation, should choose a suitable public land near the seaside to build a park to enhance the elegance of tourists and increase the municipal appearance. They discussed the matter with Dong Fei, Yin Gongtian, and Zheng Shushan, and all parties expressed their agreement. It is said that a vacant lot on the east side of the Wusong Outer Bund has been selected as the most suitable for building a park. Dong Fei opposed the large billboards erected by various companies in Shanghai, believing that they not only obscured the seaside scenery but also hindered the municipal appearance. The Political Affairs Office has now notified the companies to completely dismantle them within three months. All the procedures for building the park have been prepared and work has begun.</p>
<h3>City Center Area</h3>
<p>Planning to Build a Park and Sports Field</p>
<p>The Municipal City Center Area Construction Committee held its seventeenth standing committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the second day of this month and resolved many important cases. Among them, the case of establishing a park and sports field in the city center area has been unanimously approved. After submitting it to the municipal government for approval, preparations can be started. It is found that the facilities of parks and sports fields in this city are still extremely lacking. The existing parks are all established by the concession authorities, and even the base for the sports field must be provided by foreigners. The Municipal City Center Area Construction Committee, in view of this, has made the above suggestions. If it can be realized, it is good news for the sports community in this city. The original plan has now been found and excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>It is found that in the road system plan of the city center area, it was originally stipulated to establish a park near the corner of Songhu Road and Xiangyin Road. The transportation at that place is already very convenient, and cars and horses can reach it directly. The total area is about 400 mu, which is enough to establish a park and nearby sports field. (It is found that the Gujiazhai Garden in the French Concession covers an area of about 170 mu, Hongkou Park covers an area of about 240 mu, and Zhaofeng Garden covers an area of about 300 mu.) In addition to building a park, it is planned to open the remaining part as a sports field. The opening of this park and sports field will not only improve the physical and mental health of citizens, but also allow citizens to have more contact with the city center area, and better understand the significance of building the city center area, which is a good thing in many ways.</p>
<p>[Public Security Bureau]</p>
<p>Sending Police to Station in the Fahua Town</p>
<p>Yuan Liang, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, believing that the western suburbs of Shanghai are remote and vast, and large gangs of bandits often appear in the area, in order to maintain local security and strictly prevent incidents, ordered the Second Company of the Security Team to be stationed in the Fahua Town in the western suburbs of Shanghai last month. At 9:30 AM yesterday, Director Yuan rode in a car to the town, first gave a speech to all the officers and police of the team, and inspected the team's duties and defense arrangements. Then he inspected the surrounding area of the town and returned to the bureau at about 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Wusong Yansheng Money Shop</h3>
<p>Chen Zugen Absconded with 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Yansheng Money Shop at No. 99 Songxing Road, Wusong, is exclusively owned by Shen Zuoting from Ningbo and has been in business for more than 20 years. It is a well-known brand in the Wusong money shop industry, specializing in business transactions and private loans. Shen is 54 years old, started from scratch, and has accumulated more than 100,000 yuan recently due to annual surpluses in business. Chen Zugen, the shop's bookkeeper, is 24 years old, from Cixi, Ningbo. He joined Yansheng at the age of 14 and has been working for 10 years. He started as an apprentice and is usually honest and diligent and very friendly with his colleagues. He has always been valued by Shen and was promoted to the position of bookkeeper. Shen entrusted Chen to handle all aspects of the shop's transactions and receipts without any supervision. Chen's account books have been orderly over the years, so Chen is the most trusted and relied upon by the owner among all the staff in the shop. Unexpectedly, Chen suddenly disappeared on the 2nd of this month and could not be found anywhere. The shop initially kept it secret due to business reasons, but the reason was revealed to the outside world yesterday. On the afternoon of the 2nd, Chen was ordered by Shen to take 10,000 yuan in foreign currency by train to Shanghai and deliver it to the Siming Bank on Beijing Road. Unexpectedly, after Chen arrived at the bank, he hid the 10,000 yuan that should have been delivered and then withdrew 10,000 yuan in cash from the bank with his passbook and absconded with the money. When Shen did not see Chen return in the evening, he thought that Chen had stayed behind due to something. By the morning of the 3rd, Chen had still not returned to the shop. Shen began to suspect, but thinking about Chen's past behavior, he decided that nothing intentional could have happened, so he waited all day again. It was not until late that day that Shen received a letter from Chen delivered by the post office, which roughly said that he was deeply grateful for the many years of patronage and felt deeply in his heart. However, due to economic difficulties, he has now temporarily borrowed 20,000 yuan in foreign currency from his old teacher's place (Chen is a disciple of Shen's student Sang). He plans to go to Dalian to develop elsewhere. When he achieves something in the future, he will return the money with interest. Heaven is above, and there will be no mistakes, etc. After reading it, Shen realized that Chen had absconded and was greatly shocked. He immediately checked the account books handled by Chen, and everything was in order. So, on the morning of the 4th, he investigated at the Siming Bank and found that 10,000 yuan had been withdrawn from the 70,000 yuan in foreign currency deposited in the Siming Bank by Chen with his passbook. Shen immediately sent people to investigate and reported the situation to the guarantor, asking for compensation. At the same time, he notified Chen's family in Cixi. Shen also found a photo of Chen yesterday and reported it to the 7th District Public Security Bureau for arrest.</p>
<h3>Renkang Pawnshop Sets a Date for Redemption and Compensation</h3>
<p>The Renkang Pawnshop on Xinmin Road in Zhabei suddenly caught fire on the 12th of last month, causing a significant loss of pawned goods. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau had previously sent personnel to investigate and, together with the Municipal Public Security Bureau, supervised the inventory of the remaining gold jewelry with numbers, totaling</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>6,000 numbers, sealed for further investigation. It is heard that the pawnshop itself was negligent. Following the revised Article 18 of the Municipal Pawnshop Business Rules, the value of the pawned goods sold within two years should be ascertained and calculated at the median value as the original value of the pawned goods to determine the compensation percentage, and interest should still be deducted. The median value of the pawned goods sold by the shop within the last two years is less than 12% of the principal. In order to take care of the pawn customers, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau advised the shop to compensate generously in accordance with the municipal distribution rules. It has now been verified that gold jewelry will be compensated at 70% of the face value after deducting interest, silver jewelry will be compensated at 30% of the face value after deducting interest, pearl jewelry and watches will be compensated at 50% of the face value after deducting interest, and other pawned clothes will be compensated at 30% of the face value after deducting interest. Interest will be deducted up to the date of the fire. No interest will be calculated after the fire. As for the pawned goods with numbers, they should still be redeemed as usual. It is also heard that the Zhabei Datong Road Charity Group has been temporarily borrowed as the compensation location. The redemption period is set from the 7th of this month to the 6th of September. The Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus have jointly announced this to all the pawn customers of the shop yesterday.</p>
<h3>Children Who Won Awards After Physical Examination</h3>
<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare and Relief Association recently held a Zhabei health campaign and invited pediatrician Dr. Fu Wenshou, female doctor Yang Suzhen, and Huang Rende, the chief secretary of the Shanghai Dental Hygiene Association, to conduct physical examinations of infants. The purpose was to promote children's health and treat children's diseases. A total of 89 children were examined, and the doctors assessed the physical condition and awarded prizes to five infants: (1) The winning infant under one year old was female child Wu Tao Hong, 7 months old, residing at No. 15 Yuqing Lane, North Sichuan Road. (2) The winning infant under two years old was male child Zhang Chunrong, 16 months old, residing at No. 2 Bianxiang Lane, Baoshan Road. (3) The winning infant under three years old was male child Zhang Xiaogou, 3 years old, residing at the entrance of Changan Lane, Qiujiang Road. (4) The winning infant under four years old was male child Wu Mingde, 3 years and 5 months old, residing at No. 623 Yuyuan Road. (5) The winning infant over four years old was female child Yuan Daoshan, 4 years old, residing at No. 25 Anlin Lane, Xieqiao. The association awarded prizes to the above infants at the Shanghai Children's Education and Training Center on Qiujiang Road on July 4th to encourage them. Each child received a gold-edged certificate prepared by the association, with the words "Light of the Nation, Foundation of a Strong Country, the Younger Generation is to be Feared," etc. The Jishi Foreign Company also presented each child with two cans of Kening milk powder. After the children received the awards, they and their families were extremely happy. More than two-thirds of the remaining children who did not win awards had shortcomings in their physical condition. The doctors gave detailed instructions and ordered them to go to the health care clinic run by the association for treatment or introduced them to other hospitals for treatment.</p>
<h3>He Xiaoyazi Forgets Father After Marrying</h3>
<p>The Police Station Ordered Her to Settle Out of Court</p>
<p>He Xiaoyazi, a woman from Lincheng, is 21 years old and has a good appearance. Three years ago, she was brought to Shanghai by her father He Xiaoping through her fellow villager Hu San and recommended to work in a yarn factory. Initially, she had a monthly salary of 10 yuan, which she brought back to her hometown to subsidize her family. After a year, there was no news and no money was sent back. A year later, her father came to Shanghai to look for her everywhere but could not find her. His fellow villager Hu San also disappeared. Later, he met another fellow villager and learned that Xiaoyazi had been married to a certain Jia, who is now an employee of the Railway Bureau, as a concubine through Hu's matchmaking. She resides at No. 1094 Nanlin Lane, Menggu Road, Zhabei. He immediately went to the address to look for her. It happened that his daughter Xiaoyazi was riding home in a chartered car, wearing fashionable clothes, a cheongsam, and leather shoes, resembling a mistress in a mansion. He, however, was wearing old blue cloth clothes and pants, looking like a rustic old man from the countryside. Seeing that it was his daughter, he stopped the chartered car and forced his daughter to return to her hometown. Xiaoyazi refused, causing a dispute. The patrol police arrived and took the father and daughter to the First Station of the Fourth District. After interrogation by Director Yao, Xiaoyazi claimed that she had married a husband and did not have to worry about food and clothing, so she did not want to return to her hometown. She was willing to give her father 200 yuan. He Xiaoping confessed that he was old and 200 yuan was not enough to support him until death. He had to be given at least 2,000 yuan, otherwise he would return to his hometown together. Director Yao, believing that the case was a dispute between father and daughter, ordered them to settle out of court.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Western Sergeant</h3>
<p>The Honorable Retirement of Mills</p>
<p>Judges and Lawyers Publicly Present a Silver Shield</p>
<p>Mr. Mills, the Western Sergeant of the Legal Section of the Police Department of the Public Concession, is retiring due to the completion of his service. Yesterday, judges of the Special District Court and lawyers of the police department presented him with a silver shield as a memento. Mr. Mills is Scottish from England, currently fifty-five years old. He came to Shanghai in his prime and began working for the Public Concession on July 14, 1903, as a patrolman. Due to his meritorious service, he was promoted to sergeant and transferred to the Xinzha Police Station. When the Mixed Court was reorganized into the Provisional Court, the Public Concession established a legal section due to the increasing number of lawsuits, specifically to handle public prosecutions. Mr. Mills was then transferred to this section to assist lawyers in handling all matters. He was diligent and dedicated in his duties, deeply praised by his superiors, and able to work harmoniously with his colleagues. July 18th of this year was the date of his term completion. Mr. Mills, considering his old age and declining energy, decided to retire and return to his homeland. Xu Jiashi, the Chief of the Criminal Division of the Special District Court, along with Judges Sun Yuan, Luo Renji, and Shen Shumu, all had close friendships with Mr. Mills. Similarly, the colleagues in the Public Concession's legal section, including lawyers Bo Liang, Wei Yinde, Ru Baoji, Gan Jingxian, Wang Yaotang, Li Zhishan, Zhang Tianyin, and Hu Jiabao, as well as Western Inspector York and Western Sergeant Hallpike, all had deep affection for Mills. After several years of working together, a separation was inevitable. To commemorate their friendship, they collected funds to create a large silver shield, engraved with English details of Mr. Mills' twenty-seven years of service and achievements. The presentation was held at 9:00 AM yesterday in the first courtroom of the Special District Court. Everyone gathered, and the silver shield was placed on the table. Chief Judge Xu delivered a speech, briefly stating that Sergeant Mills had served in the police department, from the Mixed Court to the Provisional Court, and finally to the present court, representing the police department in handling criminal cases for twenty-seven years. He was diligent and conscientious in his duties, and his merits were outstanding, deeply admired by his colleagues. Now that he is returning to his country after completing his term, his colleagues respectfully present him with a memento as a souvenir and wish him good health. Lawyers Bo Liang and Gan Jingxian then delivered speeches, briefly stating that when they joined the legal section in 1928, there were four sergeants, Mr. Mills being one of them. Now, three have already been transferred, and Mr. Mills is also about to retire. Old friends are scattered, how can one not feel saddened? They are grateful for the kindness of the Chief Judge in presenting such a precious gift, not only does Mr. Mills feel grateful, but they also feel honored. Mr. Mills then stepped forward, shook hands with Chief Judge Xu to express his gratitude, and then smilingly accepted the shield and retreated.</p>
<h3>Zhu Jixing Case Brought Up for Trial Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Re-scheduled for Further Hearing in Seven Days</p>
<p>The case of Zhu Jixing, a compradore at the Chartered Bank, embezzling a large sum of money from the bank has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, Chief Judge Xu of the Special District Court continued the trial. The defendant's lawyers, Jiang Yiping and Jiang Baoli, requested a two-week adjournment because the plaintiff had submitted a new statement with civil complaints attached. This would allow them to continue reconciliation on the civil litigation part. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that if a delay was necessary, the time should be shortened to avoid prolonging the matter. The court then ordered the case to be rescheduled for further hearing in seven days.</p>
<h3>Case of Accusation of Illegally Collecting Rent Awaiting Verdict</h3>
<p>Shi Jiying Previously Hired a Lawyer as Agent, Accusing the Defendant in the Criminal Court of the French Concession that he rented three houses at No. 9 Tongde Lane, Zilai Street from the Defendant Yuan Ziheng for 250 taels per month, and paid a tip of 1,800 taels. He has now learned that the houses were managed by lawyer Tibeck, and the monthly rent was only 200 taels. The Defendant impersonated the manager, overcharged the rent, and collected the tip without authorization, which violates criminal law. He requested investigation and recovery of the tip. The court ordered further verification. Yesterday, another hearing was held, and the Defendant was represented by lawyer Ba He, who argued that this case was actually because the Plaintiff owed the Defendant three months' rent, and the Defendant filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the yamen to recover it. Unexpectedly, the Plaintiff first accused the Defendant of intimidation in the criminal court, attempting to extort money. The Plaintiff has been renting for two years, why didn't he sue earlier? Moreover, the Plaintiff himself sublet the remaining houses to others, earning more than 290 taels per month. Therefore, if the Defendant is guilty, the Plaintiff should also be guilty. As for the tip, it never happened. Even if it did, according to the law, both the giver and the receiver are equally guilty. The accusation lacks evidence and should be dismissed. Judge Zhu announced the end of the debate and said the court would make its judgement.</p>
<h3>Searching Suspicious Pedestrians</h3>
<p>Two Thieves Arrested: Firearms Confiscated</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, thieves He Ziming and Wang Zhongnian, along with their gang, robbed Ye Jinhong's house at No. 1037 Linqing Road, armed with weapons, making off with property worth 85 silver dollars. Western detective Whiteley and Chinese detective Zhang Degong of the Yangshupu Police Station found the suspects' behavior suspicious and approached them for inspection. However, He and his gang fled. The detectives fired shots, wounding and subduing thieves He and Wang. A pistol and five bullets were confiscated and brought to the police station. They were ordered to be sent to the hospital for treatment. Once recovered, they will be brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Business Failure, In Desperation, He Threw Himself Into the River</h3>
<p>Around 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, a middle-aged man wearing a white short shirt and trousers suddenly jumped into the river from the Baidu Bridge outside the Suzhou Creek Estuary, attempting suicide. Fortunately, Chinese officer No. 30 of the water police station saw him and immediately rescued him. Because he had not swallowed much water, he did not drown. He was taken to the police station, where he identified himself as Yang Yuquan, 32 years old, from Pudong. He had been in the raw hide business in Hankou. Last year, he received a telegram from his mentor, Lin Qinzai, stating that the manager (Yang's senior apprentice brother) of the Yi Tai Raw Hide Shop outside Xiaodongmen had died and instructed him to return to Shanghai to take over his senior brother's position. Upon receiving the telegram, he moved his family to Shanghai, rented a place in Pudong, and immediately joined Yi Tai Shop to work. Unexpectedly, the business was poor, and he repeatedly lost money. The 3,000-4,000 gold dollars owed by his senior brother during his tenure were also demanded one after another. He was unable to repay them, and the business was about to be abandoned. Lamenting his unfortunate fate, he decided to end his life by jumping into the river to get rid of his troubles. His mentor, Lin Qinzai, is now the manager of Rui Tai Xiang Raw Hide Shop at No. 19 Xihua Road. The sergeant, fearing that his statement was false, immediately sent detective Huang Songsheng to bring his mentor, Lin Qinzai, to the police station. Lin said that Yang was honest by nature, and he valued him very much. Last year, he introduced him to Yi Tai Shop because of his loyalty. The fact that the shop is losing money is indeed true, but it is not his fault, and the shop owner has not blamed him. On the first of this month, he saw him looking worried, acting abnormally. Fearing something else might happen, he sent someone to secretly monitor his movements. Today, it turned out as expected, he tried to commit suicide. Fortunately, he did not die, it is truly a great fortune, and so on. The police station ruled that Yang should be allowed to be taken back by his mentor.</p>
<h3>Shen Zhongjin</h3>
<p>Argued with Wife, Committed Suicide by Drowning</p>
<p>Shen Donglai, from Ningbo, residing at No. 2337 Dongyouheng Road in Hongkou, worked as a stoker on a ship. He had a son named Shen Zhongjin, 28 years old, who worked at the China Photo Studio printing company. His parents loved him very much, so last July, they married him to a Miss Zhu. However, Shen Zhongjin was already involved with someone else and considered the marriage arranged by his parents to be blind and devoid of love. Therefore, their relationship was like water and charcoal. Even though his wife tried her best to please him, he was not satisfied. On June 30th, during lunch, Shen Zhongjin found a dish prepared by his wife unappetizing. Since there was no affection between the couple, even the smallest things could lead to disputes. Therefore, Shen Zhongjin loudly criticized his wife for failing to manage the kitchen well. The woman, unable to bear it any longer, retorted. Shen Zhongjin, angered, left the house, feeling extremely mentally distressed and unable to escape it, and decided to commit suicide. Since Shen left the house, five days have passed, and his family has been in great panic, searching everywhere without any trace. They reported to the police stations, requesting attention. Yesterday morning, the water police station at the Yangshupu Whitall Wharf retrieved a male corpse and took it to the Nanhua Wharf Life Saving Bureau for inspection. Soon, Shen's family received the news, and Shen Donglai's mother, Shen Li, rushed to the Life Saving Bureau and identified the body as her beloved son. She wept loudly, extremely tragically. The police station then ordered her to submit a statement to the local court for inspection. Prosecutor Lei and the coroner arrived at the scene for inspection, confirming that he had drowned. They ordered the family to collect the body for further investigation.</p>

The Lujiabang police station detained the driver, Yu Fusheng, and transported the injured woman to the hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, she died before taking a few steps. The police station presented Yu to the 2nd District Police Station for interrogation and ordered Gu Tiyun, the head of the 12th map of the 25th guarantee, to report to the local court for autopsy.

<h3>A Boy Killed by a Car</h3>
<p>Tragedy on the Way Home from a Funeral</p>
<p>Zhang Alin, from Pudong, lived in Gaojia Lane, Pudong, and worked as a farmer. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 a.m., he brought his ten-year-old son, Fugeng, from Pudong to Shanghai to attend the seven-seventh day memorial service at his aunt's house in the Catholic Church in the city. Because the house was small and crowded, after dinner that night, he took Fugeng to a friend's place behind Songshan Road in the French Concession to stay overnight. However, they were not far from their destination, and while crossing the road, a car, number 10258 of the Concession, came speeding by. Fugeng was unable to dodge in time and was struck in the head, his breath faint. The constable arrived, recorded the car number, and the injured child was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, his injuries were too severe, and he died before reaching the hospital.</p>
<h3>A Dead Person in a Car</h3>
<p>Died En Route to the Hospital</p>
<p>The Employer Should Be Responsible for the Funeral</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 12:30 p.m., a sedan car with a white license plate and the Concession's registration number 12541 and the Municipal Government's registration number 4444 suddenly arrived in front of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall on Ningbo Road in the French Concession. Inside the car, besides a driver, there was a young woman, about 17 or 18 years old, wearing a white calico short shirt, black calico pants, and white socks without shoes. She had already died, and her face was covered with a white note. She was still sitting upright on the car cushion. For a moment, the onlookers were like a wall. The driver got out of the car and told the Tongren Fuyuan Hall that a Mr. Niu from Xiaodongmen Street in the Nanshi district had hired his car. The deceased in the car was a maid hired by Mr. Niu, only 19 years old. She had been seriously ill and asked him to send her to the Pingmin Hospital in Zhabei for treatment. Who knew that the car had barely traveled to the vicinity of the Old North Gate when the woman suddenly died. Therefore, he had no choice but to request the hall to temporarily collect the body. The hall stated that since the woman had an employer, the employer should be responsible for the funeral. As it was a matter of human life, they could not decide on their own and ordered the driver to report to the police station immediately for further investigation. The driver then drove to the police station to report the incident.</p>
<h3>Woman Mourns Husband Burned to Death, Takes Poison</h3>
<p>The Deyuanxiang Shoe Store at No. 543-545 Gongguan Road in the French Concession suddenly caught fire the day before yesterday (the 2nd), burning ten people to death, as reported in the newspapers. Among them, many shop assistants, including a Suzhou native named Wang Shifu, were unable to escape and died in the fire. Afterwards, the shop ordered someone to contact his family in Suzhou, but did not mention that Shifu had been burned to death, falsely stating that he had been injured in a fall and sent to a hospital for treatment. His wife, Chen, from Changzhou, heard the news and took a train to Shanghai with her husband's elder brother, Wang Jinsheng, staying at Room 10, Zhixin Hotel on Wuma Road. Upon arriving in Shanghai, she learned that her husband Shifu had already been burned to death. Hearing this, she was so grief-stricken that she fainted repeatedly. Yesterday morning at around 8:00 a.m., while Shifu's elder brother was unprepared, she swallowed heavy weight smoke powder, attempting to end her life. Jinsheng noticed and rushed her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, she was saved by the doctor, but she is still very ill.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Enticing a Young Girl</h3>
<p>Cao Jinyu, a native of Nantong who runs a stove shop at No. 101, Tianzhu Tang Street, Dongjiadu, Nanshi, has a daughter named Cuiying, who is only fifteen years old but has developed early and is already grown up. She is graceful and has opened her heart to love. She is in love with a car driver named Wang Alin and does not obey her parents' restrictions. On the 22nd of last month, she and Wang Alin opened Room 38 of the Ai Wu Hotel on Wuma Road, becoming temporary lovers, lingering and forgetting to return for half a month. Before the day before yesterday, Cao entrusted someone to find Wang Alin, who took the opportunity to escape, while Cuiying was led home. However, her wild nature was hard to tame, and she secretly ran away again at around 3 a.m. that night. Cao searched everywhere and decided to punish her severely. Yesterday, a friend named Wang Kouzi rushed to report that he saw Cuiying at No. 25, Caoxie Wan, Nanjing Road. Cao then went there with him and found his daughter. When asked, the resident of the house, named Lu Chunxiang, said that the girl was Wang Alin's mistress, and he was hiding her there. Cao then called the police and arrested Lu and his daughter and brought them to the 1st District, 1st Branch Police Station. The case concerns the enticing of a young girl and was immediately transferred to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Record of a Stepfather Finding His Daughter</h3>
<p>Wang Alin Entices with Chen Cuiying</p>
<p>Pretending to Live Together, They Are Arrested and Taken Away</p>
<p>Chen Cuiying, a 15-year-old girl from Tongzhou, is the daughter of Chen Kui, who sells fruit at the Dadema Road in Nanshi. When Cuiying was four years old, Chen Kui and his wife disagreed and divorced, and the girl Cuiying went with her mother. Later, the mother and daughter's livelihood became increasingly difficult, and the mother had no choice but to live with Cao Jinyu, a fellow villager from Dongjiadu who runs the Guiyulou stove shop. Cuiying then followed her mother and lived with Cao, taking Cao's surname, and has done so for more than ten years. Cuiying has also grown into an adult and is very beautiful. Now, there is a man named Wang Alin from Pudong, 30 years old, who is a driver on a car. He saw that Cuiying was very beautiful, so he tried to seduce her with great effort. Over time, Cuiying fell into his trap, and they had been secretly seeing each other more than once. Cuiying was afraid of Cao, so on the evening of the 1st of this month, she secretly ran away while Cao and others were unprepared and eloped with Wang. However, because they lacked a suitable house for the time being, they had nowhere to stay. They happened to meet their friend Lu Chunxiang from Pudong, who works as a detective in the 3rd Squad of the 1st District of the Water Police Force. He had spare rooms in his residence at No. 25 Wangjiazhai in Nanshi, so Wang negotiated a rental agreement with him and started living with Cuiying. After Cao realized that his daughter was missing, he searched everywhere but found nothing. Then, a man named Wang Zihe, who was close to Cao, paid close attention after Cuiying ran away. Recently, he saw her going in and out of the house at No. 25 Wangjia, so he rushed to tell Cao to go there with Wang Zihe at about 7 p.m. yesterday to find Cuiying. However, Wang Alin had gone out and had not returned, so they found nothing. They immediately called Pan Zhensheng, the guard police officer of the 23rd post there, and took Cuiying and the landlord Lu Chunxiang to the 1st District, 1st Branch Police Station. After the preliminary trial by the station chief, it was determined that the case was related to a criminal matter, and he ordered them to be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation.</p>

They immediately took him back to the station. After a brief interrogation by Station Chief Xu, he stated that his name was Shen Desheng, 41 years old, from Shouzhou, Anhui. These firearms were entrusted to him by his friends Song Youqing and Wang Youfa to be taken to Hangzhou. He gave evasive answers to the remaining questions. Station Chief Xu found that the suspect Shen Desheng was carrying military fire privately and was definitely not a good person, so he prepared a document to transfer him to the bureau along with the confiscated firearms for investigation.</p>

Yesterday, the weather was hot. At around 5 p.m., Er Chen went swimming in Zhaojiabang. Because he did not know how to swim, he soon drowned. Later, Kong Qingxing, the police officer of the 9th year in the area, noticed him and tried to rescue him, but he had already died.

Detective Ding Wensheng was ordered to arrest Hu and Zhong and bring them to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the French Public Hall for investigation. The plaintiff submitted the previous situation. When questioned, Zhong stated that her husband had abused her, so she eloped with Hu Zhengwu. Hu stated that Zhong had voluntarily eloped with him. Judge Zhu sentenced Hu to one month in the Western prison as a warning and ordered Zhong to be taken back and supervised by the plaintiff.</p>

The victim called the police, who arrested Xu and brought him to the police station. He was sent to the French Public Hall yesterday. The plaintiff submitted the previous situation. When questioned, Xu admitted that he was poor and helpless and became greedy when he saw the money. He begged for leniency. Judge Zhu sentenced Xu to two months in the Western prison as a warning.</p>

<p>Autopsy of an Unidentified Male Corpse</p>
<p>The Yangshupu Police Station received a phone call at 9:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, stating that a male corpse had been found near Kunming Road, Huasheng Road. Western and Chinese detectives were immediately sent to the scene and saw that the deceased was dressed like a vagrant, wearing short shirts and pants. His head had been shot five times, and his flesh was blurred with blood, a terrible sight. The body was carried to the Perrin Road Mortuary, and one bullet was found and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court sent prosecutor Guo Wei to the scene for inspection. According to the Western police chief, several cards had been found near the deceased, but they were not his own, but a card from the Renhe Inn on Xinmin Road in Zhabei. Therefore, his name is still unknown. The police station is currently investigating the murderer. Witness Luo Honglai stated that he lives on Huasheng Road. That night, after finishing dinner, he suddenly heard five gunshots outside. He went outside to see that the deceased was lying on the ground, bleeding profusely. The murderer was nowhere to be seen. Guo then wrote and instructed that the autopsy confirmed that the deceased was an unnamed male who had been shot to death by bandits before his death. The corpse and the bullet should be taken out and handed over to the police station for record keeping. The murderer should be strictly pursued and investigated by the police station. The corpse should be handed over to the Pushan Villa for collection.</p>

<p>Excessive Bleeding, Difficult to Heal for a While</p>
<p>Jin Jinsheng, a resident of No. 70 Jintai Road, Xishi, Wusong, recently built a house and the carpentry project has been completed. Currently, it is the painting time. Yesterday, a apprentice named Mao Gou, 20 years old, from Chongming, from Jin Sensheng Painting Workshop in the Xixing section of Songxing, was sent to Jin's house to paint a wall. As soon as he climbed up the ladder, just as he was about to work, the bamboo ladder broke, causing the apprentice to fall down and suffer a serious head injury, fainting on the spot. Jin Jinsheng's son, Zuochen, saw him and used water and awakening medicine to rescue the apprentice.

<h3>Appealing for Relief from the Flood Disaster in Huaiyin</h3>
<p>The China济生会 [China Relief Society], formerly in cooperation with the Jiangsu Temporary Relief Association, jointly managed emergency relief in Huaiyin. After dividing the area and distributing aid, the matter was nearing completion. Recently, a telegram was received from Xu Jiaqing, the magistrate of Huaiyin County; Liu Bingsen, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce; Dai Guilin, a standing committee member; Zhou Yuankai and Li Xilin, the chairmen of the济生 [Relief Society] branch; and Zhou Xiaoni and Bing Xun, the chairmen of the Red Cross branch. The telegram stated that Huaiyin had experienced continuous rain for seven days and nights, turning the entire city and countryside into a flooded area. Houses collapsed, rice became expensive, poor people were submerged, cooking fires were extinguished, the wheat harvest was soaked in water, and the early autumn harvest was also affected. People were starving and dying, with no way to appeal for help. They urgently requested the allocation of funds for relief. The county had just handled drought relief when it was suddenly hit by a major flood. Such a combination of natural disasters is unprecedented. The relief funds of both associations are stretched to their limit. Seeing people dying, they cannot bear to not help. The association consulted with the Jiangsu Temporary Relief Association and combined their efforts, but it was like a drop in the bucket, ineffective. Given such a disaster, they hope that charitable people at home and abroad will join together to rescue the helpless victims, in order to save them from a major catastrophe.</p>
<h3>Sanyou Industrial Society's New Domestically Produced Woolen Suit Fabric</h3>
<p>In recent years, more and more Chinese people have taken to wearing Western suits, but the materials are all foreign goods. It is regrettable that there are no suitable domestic products that can be used as substitutes. Now, Sanyou Industrial Society has newly produced a kind of "212" soft and free woolen fabric. The texture is soft and wrinkle-resistant, making it a wonderful product among domestic goods to substitute for making Western suits. In our country with its backward industry, this kind of product is greatly valued by society.</p>
<h3>Lost Changshu Woman Awaiting Collection</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday sent a lost woman, Jin Fangyu, from the Second District. According to her, she is 19 years old, from Changshu. Her father's name is Jin Quanfu, a farmer, and her brother's name is Ba Mao, a bamboo craftsman. They have lived in Changshu for generations, in Zhongganqiao, 12 li north of Shatou Town, which borders Taicang. This time she came to Shanghai to find her cousin, Chen Rongzhou, who works at the Jingxin Yarn Weaving Factory at No. 11 Fangxie Road, Old West Gate in Shanghai, but she could not find him, which led to her getting lost. The woman has an oval face, wears a braid, and has gold wire hoops around her hair bun. She is wearing a blue-purple cloth cheongsam, striped cloth pants, yellow Western socks, and blue cloth shoes. The police were instructed to check the address for her cousin, Chen Rongzhou, but he was not found.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: I recently read a report in your newspaper's local news section on July 4th about a concubine of Jin Mu'an being sent to the济良所 [Good Samaritan Home], which is largely untrue. Your newspaper, relying on one-sided statements, hastily published it, which inevitably confuses public opinion. If what Jin Cao said were true, I should be subject to criminal penalties. How could the authorities release me so easily? Moreover, Jin Mu'an has been residing in Yongji North Lane for half a year, and the situation in his family and the behavior of Jin Cao are well known to the neighbors and can be easily inquired about. However, considering that reputation is the second life, I am unwilling to be unreasonably slandered. Moreover, your newspaper is a major force in Chinese public opinion and always seeks accuracy when publishing news. Therefore, I have specifically laid out the facts in detail, hoping that you will publish them in the newspaper to correct the record. I would be most grateful. Wishing you all the best, respectfully submitted by Chuanshu Fu, July 4th.</p>

<h3>### A Brief Record of Soaring 　　　Liu Shuofu</h3>
<p>Looking down on the wonders of the earth from an airplane is also a magnificent feat. Yesterday, the pictorial department of this newspaper, desiring to present readers with a panoramic view of Shanghai, a city of material civilization, sent Mr. Wang Xiaoting to consult with the China National Aviation Corporation. They borrowed a company airplane that was doing a test flight to take pictures of Shanghai. The matter was ordinary, but it was actually an innovative undertaking. Although airline companies on the Beijing-Shanghai-Chengdu line had examples of passenger flights, aerial photography was strictly prohibited. After this newspaper contacted the airline company, they were specially permitted to carry three people to take photos on the return trip, which was an even better opportunity. Therefore, I, along with Mr. Wang Xiaoting and Mr. Mo Tianxiang, went together. Later, Mr. Lu Shaofei also wanted to join temporarily, so we agreed to go together. The sky was clear and the weather was pleasant that day. When we arrived at the airport, the pilot had already prepared the plane and was waiting to depart. We originally planned for four people to ride together, but because the plane was a test flight, we were worried that it would not be able to carry the weight, so we had to leave Shaofei to wait. The plane we were riding in was a double-winged seaplane that could carry two pilots and four passengers. After entering the plane, we immediately prepared the photography equipment. Taking photos from an airplane is very different from usual. 1. It is necessary to predetermine the focal point, because the plane travels extremely fast. A slight moment's hesitation is already more than ten miles, so there is no spare time to adjust the focus. 2. It is not possible to find objects in the viewfinder. This is also because the flight is too fast, not allowing for leisurely searching. 3. It is not possible to rely on objects to achieve stability. Because the plane body is suspended in the air, there is nothing to rest on, and every part of the plane body is shaken by the engine. What is relied on is more wobbly than holding the camera by hand. 4. Both feet must stand firmly like riding a horse. The hands hold the camera, and the waist and above must be able to flexibly follow the trend. Then, pay attention to the scenery. Once there is something worth photographing, it must be photographed immediately, like a hunter hunting an animal. Because Mr. Wang had taken photos on airplanes many times before, and had once taken news photos in the United States while strapped to the wing of a military airplane with a leather belt, everyone called him the "News King." He had a wealth of experience in aerial photography, so he told us about these points in advance, so we were able to prepare early and did not become flustered. When the plane first started, the sound was extremely loud and the vibration was intense. Entering the water was like a motorboat, and the waves in front of the plane splashed high, filling the windows. Fortunately, Xiaoting had prepared for this and strictly forbade us from opening the windows, so we avoided the ridicule of getting soaked. After a while, there were gradually no more waves splashing. Looking down, we had already left the shore by several dozen feet. The plane gradually rose and was as smooth as riding a boat, reminding me of the line "sitting on a boat on the spring water is like sitting in the sky." This is like a "boat in the sky is like a boat on the spring water." When the plane flew to a hundred feet high, the dwellings and fields all seemed small, like toy models. Mr. Wang instructed the pilot to turn the plane and fly over the bustling streets. We also began working. We circled the Bund three times. Other places, such as western Shanghai, Zhabei, and Hongkou, were flown over at a very low altitude. The difficulty of photography also arose from this. People think that the lower and closer it is, the easier it is to photograph, but they do not know that airplanes in the air are erratic, and the rate of movement up, down, left, and right is much greater than any vehicle. Vehicles only move forward, but airplanes are not the same. The rate of movement is more intense the closer the object. Sometimes, just when the exposure is right, the plane suddenly rises or falls, and the entire photo will inevitably be blurry and unclear. This is why the "News King," who is called a skilled axeman, could only tell us to take a few more pictures, and there was no other good way to remedy it. After half an hour, the film that the three of us had brought was used up, so we packed up the photography equipment and sat down to browse the aerial scenery. At the same time, the plane also ascended to 3,500 feet. What is called the "Wusongkou" was shaped exactly like a mouth, with two beaches clamping together, and the sea coming out of it, like a natural port. White clouds were like smoke or cotton, drifting very quickly. The plane traveled through them, and it felt like being in a misty fog. At this time, the plane's ascent and descent were uncertain. Each ascent was followed by a steep descent, the air pressure was higher, and breathing was not smooth. Opening the window brought extremely strong winds, and closing the window caused the ears to thunder. Mr. Mo had never experienced this before and felt dizzy and nauseous. I had experienced the wind and waves on a sea vessel, so although I felt uncomfortable, I was still able to endure it. Only the News King was not bothered at all and ran around with a handkerchief to catch the filth. Fortunately, the test flight time had passed, and the plane gradually descended. By the time we landed on the shore, Mr. Mo and I both felt relieved, light in body and healthy in feet, back to our original selves. Shaofei asked if this trip was fun. I told him that if you want to know what flying is like, you can sit comfortably in a movie theater and watch the newsreel. You have the joy of soaring without the pain of dizziness. If you must consider personal experience to be valuable, then it is not at all necessary. The photos taken on this trip are rare, because flying in this city has never been so low. Afterwards, we also learned that it had almost caused a major dispute. The next day, a Western newspaper reported that an airplane carrying reactionary elements had flown very low, passed through the concession, and distributed leaflets in the Des Voeux Road area, etc. This aroused the attention of the concession authorities, who sent people to the airline company to investigate. After Mr. Wang personally went to testify, the doubts were dispelled. I said to Mr. Wang, "Is this also what you call a magnificent feat?" and we both laughed loudly.</p>
<p>A Hai guest Laughs It Off</p>
<p>A—You have always been happy and laughing. Why have you been so gloomy and unhappy these past two days? It seems like you have a great worry.</p>
<p>B—It's just because I lost my two closest friends.</p>
<p>A—Are these two close friends dead?</p>
<p>B—No, no. It's just because I borrowed money from them and can't pay it back for a while, so I can't see them.</p>
<p>A—I have always believed that I am a very honest person in my life. But I don't know if an honest person can play poker?</p>
<p>B—You can be your honest person. If you want to play poker, then you will inevitably lose.</p>
<p>A—Recently, young couples often file for divorce at the slightest disagreement. Do you think this approach is right?</p>
<p>B—I think this is a sign of cowardice. I am brave and fierce and do not agree with this approach.</p>
<p>A—But what does being brave and fierce have to do with the issue of divorce?</p>
<p>B—I advocate fighting to the end, fighting until you die or I live. Landlord—Why are you back at my door again? Last time* I gave you a dollar, you promised me to go to work. Why are you still playing the role of the "extending hand general"?</p>
<p>Beggar—Sir, I dare not deceive you. I really did two months of work in prison. Now I'm out to rest for a bit.</p>
<h3>The Affair of Swapping Tripods in Zhiren 　　　Zheng Yimei</h3>
<p>In Mouding County, Zhiren, there was a man named Miao Lizhong, who possessed vast assets and was famous for his wealth in the western border region. His family possessed a jadeite tripod, about a foot tall. It was purely green and flawless, without any blemishes or mottling. The luster was as if it contained water, and when sunlight shone on it, the entire body was bright and transparent. It seemed as if clouds were rising and soaring. It was placed in a huge jar, which was filled with water. Both the tripod and its reflection in the water were green. Lizhong regarded it as a family heirloom. Whenever he hosted banquets, he would take it out for display, and everyone who saw it praised it endlessly. A Western connoisseur once offered a price of ten thousand taels of gold, but Lizhong could not bear to part with it and give it away. This spring, during the Cold Food Festival, Lizhong fell ill and died. He had three sons, who planned to divide the property and separate the household. Each coveted the jadeite tripod and wanted to possess it for themselves. However, there was only one tripod, so the gain of one was the loss of the others. They argued endlessly. Then, the eldest son proposed to break the tripod into three. The second and third sons also agreed, saying that since it could not be kept intact, it would be better to break it into pieces. Getting a tripod foot would be enough to comfort them. They planned to break it in public the next day. There was a clever and cunning servant in the Miao family who heard about this and carefully considered it. He remembered that there was a counterfeit tripod in an old goods shop that resembled this one. He bought it back with a good price and secretly swapped it. The next day, the tripod was indeed broken, and they took the pieces. The three sons did not realize the difference. Last month, the eldest son gave the tripod foot to a jade craftsman to carve it into other ornaments. The jade craftsman said, "This is just like wufuzi, not jadeite." The eldest son was surprised. He and his second brother investigated the matter together. The servant was fearful and fled with the tripod. They reported it to the authorities, but he had already flown away and disappeared, and his whereabouts were unknown. In the past, during the Gengzi Boxer Rebellion, the Allied forces ravaged the areas around the capital. The contents of the Imperial Palace were seized and taken out. Two soldiers from a certain country obtained a huge old Ge kiln dish. It was impossible to divide the spoils, so they wanted to break it. It happened to be seen by a certain antique dealer, who exchanged it for ten taels of gold. Ancient objects were thus preserved and brought to Shanghai, where they became rare and valuable items. This is similar to the affair of swapping tripods, so I have recorded it here.</p>
<h3>Strange Disease 　　　　Chang</h3>
<p>Mr. Guo Yuanqing of Que Laoting, North Township, Hang County, is in his thirties and has never had any illnesses. One evening, he was standing in front of the door casually gazing around when he suddenly felt a slight itch in his heart, as if countless tiny insects were wriggling. At first, he could tolerate it, but then the itch gradually became more and more intense. He was restless whether sitting or lying down. Finally, the itch became unbearable. He sweated profusely, his face changed color, and he rolled around on the ground in a frenzy. His family was alarmed and urgently sought several doctors to treat him, but none of them recognized the cause of his illness. Therefore, they were all helpless. While they were in a state of confusion, an old man who sold candy and lived across the street heard the news and came to see him. After seeing the situation, the old man said to everyone, "If you boil fresh camphor tree bark into a soup, and it does not have the smell of camphor, I can cure it. Otherwise, I do not know what to do." Everyone had no choice but to try it. Sure enough, it had no tree smell. So, the old man ordered Mr. Guo to take off his upper clothes and lie face down on the couch. Then, the old man bent the middle finger of his right hand and used the finger joint to strike his back all over. After every four or five strikes, a lump would rise up. Dozens of lumps rose up on his entire back. He pierced each one with a needle and squeezed it with his finger. Then, a white, sticky, smelly substance resembling glutinous rice grains came out of the lump. After the sticky substance in each lump was squeezed out, the heart itch stopped, and the illness disappeared. Everyone was surprised and happy. They all asked the old man what the name of the disease was. The old man replied that he did not know. However, he said that thirty years ago, a village elder named Huang Zhengrong in Dongyang, our county, also suffered from the same strange disease. He asked all the famous doctors in the vicinity to treat him, but none of them were effective. Later, a quack doctor treated him with the above method, and he recovered. According to the doctor, this disease is very dangerous. If it is not treated properly, it will be fatal within twenty-four hours. At that time, I happened to be working as a servant in Mr. Huang's house, so I witnessed it. However, at that time, I did not hear the doctor mention the name or origin of this disease.</p>
<p>What is recorded above is a strange disease. It is also a dangerous disease. It is specially highlighted so that those in the world who suffer from the same disease will know how to be saved and treated. May all of you readers widely publicize it.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Southeast Asia 　　　(43) 　　　Hua</h3>
<p>On the 12th, I read a newspaper report that someone who attempted suicide by drowning was detained and fined by the government. This is a very strange Western law. Does a person not have the right to commit suicide in this world? I heard a lecture on law in the past, which said that there is no right to suicide. I thought it was very strange. Now I see Westerners enforcing this law, which is too unfree. Zhang Taiyan once commented on this, saying, "If someone has no debts or responsibilities in the world, resents the world, and chooses to die in the clear and cold abyss, this is his own right to decide, and the majority has no right to inquire about it." However, the British government uses a completely passive approach to colonial policies. It allows complete freedom for opium smoking and gambling, and even has a Royal Opium Sales Bureau. There are no restrictions on the passive freedom of the people. Only suicide is strictly controlled like this. Is there a reason for this? Hong Kong and Singapore both have governors, and the governors must be able to speak Min and Cantonese. British diplomacy is the best in the world on land and sea, so the policies of Napoleon of France, William of Germany, and various policies of Russia have all failed at the hands of the British. They still maintain a first-class situation. I wonder what will happen when the peoples east of India rise up in the future. This question also has a motion to prohibit animal abuse. A meeting was convened to discuss it, and the discussion was about how to kill cattle, not to kill them by slow slicing. However, the reality is often laughable. Mr. Lu Weichang told me that in the past, a police officer interfered with someone holding a chicken upside down by its legs. He kicked the person's leg once on the left side and once on the right side. The person suddenly asked why. He said, "Because you are holding the chicken upside down by its legs." The person said, "My leg is injured by your kick, but the chicken's leg is still unharmed." Things in the world are often done without considering the root cause. There are such cases. Japan also has a law prohibiting animal abuse. Drinking places for cattle and horses are set up in various streets. American cat and dog hospitals have as many as 18,000 nurses. However, when the great war broke out, corpses lay all over the fields, and tigers and wolves ate them. Now, in various parts of China, there are also release societies to save fish, turtles, and turtles. In the past, in Hangzhou's West Lake, because of the fish selling business, a friend of mine went to Hangzhou specifically to buy all the fish in West Lake and release them, saying that he was cultivating merit. I advocate abolishing war in the world and first eliminating the ugly business of people killing each other, but he did not help me. Not seeking people and saving fish and turtles is such a reversal. On the 13th, I visited the Industry and Commerce Supplementary School. This school was established by Principal Lin Zeyang, with Tai Xu as the inscription. They asked me to write a preface, and the principal is famous for his celibacy. I greatly respect him. My respect for monks is nothing more than because they abandon worldly affairs and maintain celibacy and few desires. Therefore, celibacy is most admirable. I wrote the preface to explain the meaning of supplementary education, wanting to expand it. Using Wells's great world plan, no one should never need supplementary education, and no one should never need guidance. If society does not do this, it will hinder evolution. I examine its meaning, which is the same as Confucius's "learning without satiety and teaching without weariness." Wells extended it to the point where everyone in the world can be like this, saying that it can harmonize knowledge and advance daily without end, to the point of achieving great harmony. I wrote the preface based on this intention, hoping that more people would participate in supplementary education. Principal Lin said that there is a vacant lot here that can be used to build a new village. I very much look forward to it.</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence (62) Liu Haisu</h3>
<p>French Autumn Salon</p>
<p>(3) My Submission Process (Continued)</p>
<p>That day was September 28th. Although it was autumn, the weather was still hot and stuffy. In the morning, I went to the embassy to retrieve an old painting I had done eight years prior. This was because Minister Gao Shuqing had brought me ten of my old works. I had one stored at the embassy and hadn't thought to take it out. That evening, Chen, Liu, and Fu all came to my bedroom for a chat. Later, Zhang Xian and Qiu Shien also arrived. With three or five people gathered together, the conversation became even more lively. They had seen the previous Autumn Salons and talked about the richness of their content and the surge of new life, further stirring our blood. Mr. Fu then helped us fill out the export application right then and there. I signed it "HSBai" because my childhood name was Pan Bai; Bai being a transliteration of "Pan." After filling it out, I silently pondered whether our submissions would be selected for the Autumn Salon, which was so strict. I wasn't sure. Suddenly, I thought, "Why bother?" And without realizing it, I put the Autumn Salon matter aside and chatted about other things until late. Then we all went our separate ways to sleep. The next morning, we braved the rain to send the paintings to the Autumn Salon office. It was located in the Grand Palais on the Champs-Élysées. The Champs-Élysées is the most prosperous place in Paris. The Grand Palais is one of the most magnificent and historically famous buildings in Paris. The main entrance was currently hosting a car exhibition. We passed through the groves, walked around the fountain, and admired the reflection of the white stone sculptures on the edge of the pool, set against the lush greenery. The water's surface had faint ripples, and several red fish wandered about at the bottom. It was truly lovely. We then turned left and saw many people standing and talking on the stone steps. Upon closer inspection, it was the "B" door. This was the Autumn Salon's office. We followed the crowd in single file into a very large factory-like building. We first stored our paintings there. People who had arrived before us had already formed a line about ten zhang long. We stood in the dim factory, waiting. We felt hot and bothered, as if we were trapped in a dizzying vortex. Just as I was impatiently sighing, I suddenly felt a subtle and keen stimulation, a swift warning. As we entered, we saw thousands of stone statues lined up in the dimly lit factory. The interior was divided into rooms separated by short walls, labeled with letters A, B, C... Inside were countless paintings piled up. These were probably all the submissions that had arrived earlier. And so many people were still sending them in today. It seemed hopeless. I felt a sense of dread. I waited for an hour and then walked up to a writing desk with a bright light. We handed over the application and received a receipt. My number was already 7,611. We then went to another desk to pay. Each person paid 75 francs. I ultimately thought this was a futile endeavor. As we walked out, seeing the countless works, I was constantly in a daze, deeply worried. When we exited the Grand Palais, it was still drizzling. As far as the eye could see, a green lawn and a touch of violet stood out among the groves, revealing the spire of Napoleon's tomb. It was truly like a scene from a Monet painting.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Gold Prices Actively Rise</p>
<p>Line after line, they rise again and again. Yesterday, the fifth day, the gold market showed a sudden improvement. The trend took a bead-like turn for the better, the steps were even, and the forward market actually saw eleven taels of twists and turns. However, there was no lack of maneuvering, and the rise was large with small corrections. The psychology of the industry was firm and bullish. The exchange rate also stood out, but not as sharply as the gold price. The banks sold some, and foreign firms settled a lot, causing the market price to be looser than the listed price. The brokers' notes were still busy, but the buyers seemed to be more numerous. Yuan Sheng Jin An Yuan Xing Yong Jin Da Yong and others were all buying, while Yu Da Fu Chang Yuan Cheng Yong Fu Xing Yong Tai Feng Run and others were selling. Although there was no increase or decrease in the morning, there was a slight increase. Afterwards, the buyers bravely pushed forward, and the exchange rate rose sharply. It was said that there was a settlement, and when it came to escaping outside the 600 tael mark, it felt even more vigorous and almost earth-shattering, and it suddenly rose to more than 609 taels. However, there were advances and retreats of two, three, to four taels from time to time. As for the exchange rate, there was no major rise or fall. Finally, it fell sharply by more than two taels, and it was more than 607 taels. In the afternoon, it was Saturday, and the market was closed as usual. The silver market was as before.</p>
<p>The morning opened fairly, hovering inside the gate. The initial gold price for August was 598 taels and 2 qian. Adding 9 qian, the gross market coaxed it up to 600 taels. Trading was still flat, and then it fell slightly, to 98 taels and 78 qian. The exchange rate was stable. Taiwan absorbed 6 pence and 125 of British gold in September. After a while, the bank did a recent British gold trade of 6 pence. When the shilling was announced, it was about 601 taels. Yuan Sheng Zhi Feng Yong, Da De Cheng and others purchased them one after another. In addition, Citibank's ins and outs in August were 36 yuan and 625, up 67 taels at 10 o'clock, to 607 taels and 3 qian. Later, Fuchang Zhifengyong and others sold them, so it was suppressed by 3 taels, and at 10:30 it was reduced to 604 taels and 3 qian.</p>
<p>It is rumored that cash can be transported to Tianjin, and the price is almost soaring. The exchange rate is still stable, and Yuan Sheng and others continue to compete to buy. It is also rumored that cash can be transported to Tianjin, so the price almost has a flying color, and it rises four or five taels. However, there was a slight rise and fall of more than two taels around 11 o'clock. Mitsui and others still sold 6 pence and 0625 of British gold in September. By 11:30, it had jumped to 609 taels and 3 qian, and then Fuxingyong sold it, so it lost three taels, and at noon it was six taels two or three qian. The closing price at noon was 607 taels and 5 qian, which was 10 taels and 2 qian higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The maximum price for the five or sixty taels of gold in half a day was 609 taels and 3 qian, and the minimum price was 598 taels and 2 qian, a difference of 11 taels and 1 qian. The opening price of the goods was 98 taels and 5, and the closing price at noon was 607 taels and 5. The announced price was still 663 taels. The difference between the two prices was 62 taels to 56 taels. The registered prices were 606 taels to 609 taels, and the supplementary water was 606 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions between colleagues are constantly changing. Yuancheng Yuoxingyong, Da Decheng, Jinan Yuankang Xiangyi Yu were all bought, Wanxing, Fuchang, Tai Fengrun, Yuancheng Yong, Hengxing Yu Da, Ruikang, Fuxingyong and others were all sold, Xieyuzhifengyong, Shengda Yuan, Kunhe Futaiheng, Yichang, Zhenchangxiang and others came in and out suddenly, which was very different. The Dalian gang only sold six or seven hundred notes, and there were only a few buyers, only dozens of them. The Guang gang did not trade much, but only snatched hats, it is said.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Slightly Tighter</h3>
<p>But not as violent as the gold market</p>
<p>The hedge seems to be getting closer</p>
<p>Chinese merchants rushed in to resist the previous shorts</p>
<p>Foreign firms also have settlement news</p>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday, and the foreign exchange market was only open for half a day in the morning as usual. HSBC's listing remained unchanged, and the silver market was neither glorious nor disgraced. As for the bank's internal disk, the three exchange rates of British, American, and Japanese were all slightly tighter, but not as high as the gold price. The spot gold's soaring price far exceeded the exchange rate. Therefore, the hedge is already approaching. About forty or fifty taels, Chinese merchants, speculators, and Indian gangs have rushed in to resist the previous shorts. Foreign merchants also have news of settlement, so the popularity is strong. Therefore, the gold price will be as high as 650 taels. It is estimated that more than 200,000 pounds of British gold were traded, and more than 100,000 pounds were settled. Zhuduo Mitsui Anda and others sold them, and some sold a small amount. Taiwan has included transactions of tens of thousands of pounds between various banks, and 100,000 US dollars have also been transacted. Only tens of thousands of Japanese gold were sold to Mitsui Zhengjin Zhongxing and others by the gold industry. The Bank of China also sold 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. At noon, compared with the day before yesterday, British gold was reduced by 125, US dollars were reduced by 3125, and Japanese gold was reduced by 1.25 points. The market seems to be on the rise.</p>
<p>The internal disk of British exchange rate only rose or fell by 0625, and the swap was still 0625. The early market quoted 1 shilling and 6 pence in July, 6 pence and 0625 in August, 125 in September, and 1875 in October. The buying price was increased by 0625. Taiwan entered 5,000 pounds in September, and the price was 6 pence 125, which was transported to Meifeng, and Mitsui and Megali traded 20,000 in July at a price of 6 pence. Sumitomo Mitsui Anda and others sold 230,000 in September at a price of 6 pence 0625. Zhejiang and Shanghai traded 10,000 in October, and the price was 6 pence 1875. At noon, the offering price for July was 5 pence 9375, 6 pence for August, 6 pence 0625 for September, and 125 for October. The purchase price was still increased by 0625.</p>
<p>The internal disk of the US exchange rate was 1875 high and low, and the swap was 125. From 7 o'clock in the morning, the asking price for July was 36 yuan and a half, 36 yuan and 625 for August, 75 for September, and 875 for October. The buying price was increased by 12 yuan. Meifeng offered and Maixing Anda entered, 100,000 yuan in August, and the price was 36 yuan and 625. At noon, the offering price for July was 36 yuan 3125, 4375 for August, 5625 for September, and 6875 for October. The buying price was 36 yuan and 8125.</p>
<p>Eastern Exchange: The internal disk only rose or fell by half a point, and the swap was 25 points per month, but the recent period was tighter. From the noon market, the asking price for July was 1 tael 3 qian 5 fen 5, 1 tael 3 qian 5 fen 25 for August, 2 tael 3 qian 5 fen for September, and 1 tael 3 qian 4 fen 75 for October. The buying price was reduced by half a point. Mitsui initially entered 50,000 yuan in Dalian at the early morning price of 1 tael 3 qian 4 fen 375. The Bank of China issued 50,000 yuan in August, 1 tael 3 qian 5 fen, and traded 100,000 yuan with Zhongxing at the same price. At noon, the selling price for July was 1 tael 3 qian 6 fen, 1 tael 3 qian 5 fen 75 for August, 2 tael 3 qian 5 fen 50 for September, and 2 tael 3 qian 5 fen 25 for October. The buying price was half a point lower. There was nothing in the afternoon, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Price of Silver Dollars Increased Steadily</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday morning, the trading situation of silver dollars was still tight. The competition for prices was also very fierce. In terms of people's minds, the buying atmosphere was strong, and the state of profit also turned sharp, but the foundation of silver was very loose, which was also the main reason for the increase in the price of silver dollars. As for the formal sales volume, although it is still endless, it is no longer as good as in the past.</p>
<p>The price of silver dollar swaps: "Silver Dollars" The early market situation was better than the previous day, and the closing price was 7 qian and 2 fen and a half, which was 1 li better than the previous day's early market. The trading in the afternoon market was sparse, and the competition was also slack, so it was the same price as the early market. The silver swap rate became more and more loose. The early market only opened at 7 fen, and the afternoon market was even lower, only doing 4 fen. The overhead was always drawn in white, and there was no market for listings.</p>
<p>Market situation of subsidiary coins: Jiangnan small foreign coins fell day by day. The early market was 6 qian 2 fen 6 li and a half, and the afternoon market was 6 qian 2 fen 4 li. As a result, the two markets fell by a small 2 li and a half. Only 3,000 jiao were traded in the early market, and although the market price fell slightly in the afternoon market, there was still no one to trade. Guangdong small foreign coins also felt downstream. The early market was 6 qian and 07 li, and the afternoon market was 6 qian and 05 li. 125,000 jiao were traded in the early market, and 70,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins returned to Chang 2,000 wen, which was 392,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver dollar inflows and outflows: "Silver Funds" Yesterday was Saturday, and the bank's collection and delivery were rare as usual. Chinese merchants collected and delivered more than 1.5 million silver dollars, and foreign merchants also collected and delivered 1.5 million to 1.6 million silver dollars. Various goods, exchange tax, and miscellaneous funds collected and delivered about 7 million silver dollars. 900,000 silver dollars were taken out of the warehouse. Japanese banks collected and delivered 2.4 to 2.5 million silver dollars for various funds, and 300,000 silver dollars were put into the warehouse. The money shops and silver guilds' single collection and delivery seemed to be slightly more due to the relationship of the period, totaling more than 42.2 million silver dollars. More than 310,000 silver dollars were collected and delivered for the overhead funds. More than 700,000 silver dollars were collected and delivered for various exchange funds, and 600,000 to 700,000 in cash was collected. "Foreign Funds" The exchange funds for foreign exchange were 1,355,000 in the early market and only 515,000 in the afternoon market. There were no transactions in the early market for banknotes, and 12,000 were traded in the afternoon market. Over-the-counter banknotes were 123,000 in the early market and 70,000 in the afternoon market. Spot silver was 150,000 in the early market and 80,000 in the afternoon market. Bank trading, early market*.</p>
<p>Inter-market: 430,000 in the early market and 350,000 in the afternoon market. More than 1.4 million silver dollars were collected and delivered between foreign accounts of various banks. 1.5 million to 1.6 million banknotes were taken in and out. More than 5.2 million silver dollars were collected and delivered by money shops and foreign guilds. More than 1.7 million silver dollars were collected and delivered for foreign overhead funds. More than 1.1 million silver dollars were borrowed and lent. Small money shops collected and exchanged banknotes and sold spot silver new coins and exchange funds for 500,000 to 600,000 silver dollars. More than 200,000 in foreign sources, and more than 1.3 million was digested.</p>
<h3>The Big Silver Bar Remained Stable, and There Was No Market for American Silver</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from London yesterday, there was no increase or decrease in the near and far term of the big silver bar. The recent term was still 15 pence and 625 (equivalent to 1 shilling and 6 and a half pence). The distant term was 15 and a half pence. There was no special change in the foot, and the market was sluggish. According to a telegram from New York, the price of American silver and the American exchange rates against British and Japanese yen were suspended due to the Citibank holiday. The British exchange rate against the United States fell by 125, to 4 yuan, 8 jiao, 6 fen, 24375. The British exchange rate against the Japanese yen was still 2 shillings, 04375. The British-Shanghai shilling increased by 0625, to 1 shilling, 6 pence, 375. According to a Reuters telegram at 11:45 am today, the Japanese exchange rate against the United States was still 49 yuan and 375. The British exchange rate against the Japanese yen increased by 03125, to 2 shillings, 0375. However, according to the Telegraphic News Agency, there was no increase or decrease.</p>
<h3>The Securities and Bond Market Fell Sharply</h3>
<p>Down one to three yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, only the downsizing, customs duties, and disarmament public bonds were opened for trading in the spot market. All other bonds were not traded. The futures market was calm in the morning, but in the afternoon, as bond prices fell more sharply, the market became lively. The changes in bond prices were due to the abnormal weakness of people's minds due to the current situation. The selling pressure was strong, and the buying side was relatively poor. The forward market was calm, and the decline continued to be strong. The early and afternoon markets continued to decline step by step. Although it was not quiet in the afternoon, the downward trend did not weaken. Disarmament bonds almost stopped being auctioned, and the closing price turned slightly flat. As a result, the July disarmament bonds fell by 3 yuan and 05 fen, and the August bonds also fell by 2 yuan and 7 jiao. Other bonds fell by 1 yuan to 1 yuan and 67 jiao, but the 96 bonds only fell by a small number of jiao. The intensity of the decline was rarely seen in recent times.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Demand Is Still Strong</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn sales are still smooth, and Cantonese merchants are still actively purchasing, but Sichuanese merchants are buying less. The local market is still weak because the bottom goods are still thick. The overseas cotton yarn market is still weak, so although some have the intention to purchase, each factory has a sufficient supply of spot yarn. Therefore, the market cannot rise. Most buyers in the market are approaching the autumn season. Last year, there was a drastic rise in the three months of July, August, and September, so many people bought in and did more. However, at this time last year, the overseas yarn market rose sharply. The price of third-grade yarn was 250-260 yuan, and the domestic bottom goods were weak. There were still Indian merchants organizing purchases, so there was such a sharp rise.</p>
<p>People's Bidding Yarn Is Tired and Has No Fighting Appearance. The opening of the People's Bidding Forward Market showed that the real sales of the previous day were good, and the atmosphere in the market was firm and bullish. Each rose by two or three qian. The situation of the first and third markets suddenly loosened, and as a result, each fell by 1, 2, and 3 qian. In the afternoon, the bidding yarn fell by 1, 2, and 4 qian due to the bad atmosphere in the market. The total turnover for the day was 9,850 bales. Baoji Rongxing Taichang Tianchang Dachang Chenggong Taishin Chang sold 300 bales to 850 bales. Tianchang Yuanfeng Ruidai Yichang Deji bought 300 bales to 2,100 bales. The closing price of the People's Bidding is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Cantonese merchants buy 1675 bales of spot yarn for good sales. According to statistics, all gangs bought a total of 2,780 bales throughout the day. The same industry entered 325 bales and the opening market rose slightly. Among the foreign merchants, Guangdong bought the most, with 1,675 bales. In addition, Hankou entered 330 bales, the mainland entered 185 bales, Sichuan entered 75 bales, Tianjin entered 100 bales, Niuzhuang entered 140 bales, Yunnan entered 200 bales, and miscellaneous gangs entered 75 bales, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Is Very Quiet</h3>
<p>The cotton market is quiet because the foreign cotton market is closed, and people's minds are more stable. The situation in the market is still flat. The spot cotton business is silent, and the attitude of each factory is very calm. The demand is completely immobile, but the Japanese merchants are thinking about how the future will be, and they must follow the American cotton to advance and retreat.</p>
<p>Han Bidding, Tongxing entered 4,000 dan the most. The opening of the Han Bidding Forward Market was flat, with a near fall of 5 fen and a far rise of 5 fen to 1 qian. It was still flat in the afternoon. The middle month rose 5 fen. According to the investigation, Ruidai Shenji Tianchang Xingyuan Gongtai sold 500 dan to 2,600 dan. Hengyi Dafeng Tongxing Tianchang Shenchang bought 800 dan to 1,000 dan. The total turnover for the day was 21,700 dan. The closing price of Han Bidding is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>The Grain Market in Hexia Is Stable</h3>
<p>The gate-husk has been evaluated as usual.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the northern japonica rice price at the Zhabei Gate was already moving, and the price was still 21 yuan at the highest. The remaining second-class goods were discounted according to the grade. The number of husks was more than 1,000 shi. The source is still cut off, and the japonica rice inventory will be husked soon. The indica rice market was silent, and there were a few transactions of variable yuan. The sales were flat, and the arrivals were sparse. The price was neither glorious nor disgraced.</p>
<p>The source of Hexia rice in Shanghai South is less than ten. The intake and digestion of this street is still acceptable. The high price of Suchow and Tong machine rice is 21 yuan, and the second price is 20 yuan. The situation is stable. Nanbang's sailing ships have sporadic thin rice arrivals. The cost is relatively high because the price of products in the inner road is also reported to be expensive recently, so the market is also in the price limit. The Western Du top-quality goods are rarely seen and are fixed. Most of the Western rice villages and small-scale sales are to Tianjin. The intake and digestion of both Tongbian and Diaofan are sluggish. Recently, both the goods and customers have been selling as they arrive, so the market feels weak. The custom yuan has arrived slightly, but the digestion is not smooth, and the market price is around 18 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>The Central Customs Western Rice Suddenly Drops by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Western rice suddenly changed because it was rumored after the market opened that the Chelu Road was disturbed by bandits, and the intake and digestion of the mainland gangs was immediately stopped. Other foreign gangs stopped because they had recently received dumping goods, their appetite was full, and they intended to take this opportunity to wait and see, waiting for it to be small. This street also stopped because the goods were sufficient. The unified market only had brown rice, and this street and the mainland were handling it slightly. Except for the cheap sale of white indica rice, there was no way out. The market immediately became unsmooth... rice arrived... decreased by a small half yuan compared to the previous day, and all kinds of brown rice decreased by a small two or three angles. Saigon one and two numbers each decreased by a small angle and a half. A total of 8,000 bags of various kinds of indica rice and 4,000 bags of brown rice were opened for sale throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Flour Futures Jump Up Four or Five Cents</h3>
<p>Due to Increased Demand for Military Provisions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market experienced another major fluctuation. At present, prices are soaring and plummeting, seemingly entirely dictated by the political situation. The previous day, due to the customs' ban on exports, it was anticipated that sales would be hit, causing widespread anxiety and a decline in the market. When trading opened yesterday, this month's contracts continued the previous day's downward trend, falling as low as 2.485 taels. Thereafter, the market surged upwards smoothly, with a momentum that exceeded general expectations. Although flour exports to Tianjin were banned, demand surged in Nanjing and the Yangtze River region, either for military provisions or due to rising rice prices. Market sentiment was further fueled by rumors that Yangtze River shipping would be disrupted due to military needs, hindering wheat arrivals. With flour sales able to substitute and raw materials unable to flow freely, anxiety was reignited. Opening prices rose sharply. Given the complexity of the situation, it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome. As a result, contracts from May to September each rose by 4.25 cents compared to the previous day, October rose by 4 cents, November rose by 5.25 cents, and December rose by 4.5 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Affected by Rumors</h3>
<p>Fears of Supply Disruption… Prices Rise Four or Five Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, wheat futures showed some weakness, with October reaching a low of 4.81 taels, August at 4.93 taels, and September at 5.04 taels. However, in subsequent trading, prices gradually recovered, driven by rumors that wheat supplies would be temporarily disrupted. Rumors circulated that the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway near Ben Niu had been sabotaged by bandits and that over thirty ships on the Yangtze River had been detained. With these rumors rife, market sentiment rose steadily. In the afternoon, market sentiment strengthened considerably. However, mills were unwilling to raise prices, so the price increase was not substantial. As a result, this month's contract was up one cent from the previous month, August was down four cents, September was up five cents, October was up five cents, November was up three cents, and December was up two cents. Current spot wheat prices remained stable for average quality, while high-quality wheat, due to limited inventory, rose by another three to four cents. It is reported that the total volume of wheat from Hankou, Yangzhou, Tongzhou, Shuangfeng, Penglai, Kunshan, and Xuzhou was over 4,600 yuan.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: European and American Silk Sales Remain Difficult</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign silk market remained sluggish. European and American silk mills are now increasingly using rayon, leading to a significant decline in raw silk consumption. Telegraphic reports indicate low prices. Chinese merchants generally believe that losses are too high, making negotiations difficult. The future of the silk market is increasingly bleak.</p>
<h3>Summer Cocoons from Zhejiang Province Finish Harvest</h3>
<p>New Summer Cocoons from Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Huzhou, Jiaxing, and Other Areas Are Continuously Being Shipped</p>
<p>This year's summer cocoon harvest in various areas of Zhejiang Province has been poor. Cocoon exchanges opened scales one after another, with those who received more cocoons for two weeks, and those who received less for seven or eight days. The amount received was generally limited. Now they have all finished. Newly harvested dry cocoons are now transported by both water and land, following the same methods as spring cocoons, due to a shortage of freight cars in various bureaus. Therefore, new summer cocoons from various areas are now being loaded onto boats and transported to Shanghai in separate batches.</p>
<h3>Precious Eyebrow Green Tea Sales to Europe Remain Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no significant progress in the overall situation of the foreign tea market. Gongxi green tea showed some activity due to the approaching opening of the Russian season. However, the most important precious eyebrow green tea already has an inventory of over 20,000 boxes. Apart from a slight interest in the high-grade core-extracted goods, English and French merchants are not discussing any other transactions. Items such as needle eyebrows and delicate eyebrows have seen some sporadic transactions recently, but selling prices are very low. The future of the tea market is difficult to view optimistically.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Gray Cloth and Foreign Yarn Prosper</p>
<p>Piece goods trading shows activity among merchant guilds, but transaction volume is low. Eastern goods are the main items. Banana leaf Zhongshan wool had a tendency to be snapped up yesterday, because the Sichuan guild has already taken action, and Ningbo Main Street is also searching widely, leading to the complete sale of spot goods. Prices rose from 2.435 to 2.45 taels. Qianhua tribute flannel is in high demand on Main Street. Royal Garden opened out at 3.075 taels, with both bald yuan and bald red completely out of stock. After the fine serge was once sought out by retailers, prices rose slightly. Yesterday, Lake Pavilion blue-gray mixed colors sold for 2.525 taels, Zijinshan for 2.5 taels, and Four Students for 2.475 taels. Gray cloth and foreign yarn are becoming increasingly scarce, with an unprecedentedly strong trend. The newly arrived Yuanji Beauty cloth, ten pieces, are a mere drop in the bucket. According to investigations yesterday, there are only four pieces of Dianqiuxiang cloth on the market, already priced at 9.75 taels. All Li Taibai, Little Beauty, Lintongguan, and Zijinshan cloths have no stock. Therefore, dozens of pieces of gray cloth and printed cloth blank, re-dyed, are sold daily, a truly rare phenomenon. Western goods saw a slight softening in Liyannian tribute flannel yesterday, selling for 2.3 taels. Yuanxi satin, one chi six cun, and other items remained firm and expensive.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: 1,200 Packages of Longkou Vermicelli Arrive</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli used to be sold for as high as 19.5 taels due to stock shortage. Yesterday, it was reported that a batch of 1,200 packages had arrived, of which only a hundred packages were goods from outside merchants, and the rest were goods self-managed by various firms. The tone of outside merchants is still tight, and they are still unwilling to sell for less than 19 taels. If the market situation in Guangdong and Hong Kong turns, sales will surely be smooth. It is expected that merchants will raise prices again, which is also expected.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 40,000 yuan in silver dollars shipped to Shantou; over 1,100 bales of American cotton arrived; 1,500 pieces of ore sand shipped to Europe immediately; 1,800 boxes of matches shipped to the Yangtze River; 360 bales of Indian burlap bags shipped to Hankou; 300 pieces of coconut oil shipped from Luzon; 300 pieces of yarn ends shipped to France; over 400 barrels of tobacco leaves shipped from North America to Shanghai; 4,000 boxes of small white iron sheets shipped from New York to Shanghai; 2,040 bales of cotton yarn shipped to Upper Yangtze; 3,500 bags of white rice shipped to Anhui Province. Zhangzhou News: The selling price of fresh orchid branches is 5 to 4.6-7 yuan. New Zaohong branches and island leaf branches will arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>

<h3>Literature and National Consciousness - Ying Peng</h3>
<p>2.  The fact that the Chinese intellectual world has forgotten its own nation is the responsibility of education. The central goal of Chinese education has never been established, as can be seen in the textbooks commonly used in schools. As a result, this morbid transmission is fully manifested in the new literature.</p>
<p>In the past two years, the new literature has lost its central consciousness, leading authors wandering in divergent paths to feel distressed and bored. On the one hand, it has formed a decadent ideology, immersing the entire spirit of young people in the pleasures of nightlife. On the other hand, it has put forward the slogan of the proletariat, but its purpose is merely to find economic solutions in life.</p>
<p>We are not opposed to enjoyment, but enjoyment is the result of effort and the reward of struggle. The Chinese nation is now living through an "era of suffering." The only way out of the "era of suffering" is to work hard and break through this dangerous environment. We must wait until material construction has made considerable progress before we can talk about enjoyment. Otherwise, we will only decline. The new-style decadent and dissipated life and the old-style reclusive life in the mountains are the same psychology.</p>
<p>"Roar, China!" If our "national consciousness" is extremely strong, we should absolutely not allow others to shout on our behalf. Otherwise, it shows our lack of promise, which is extremely shameful. A nation's struggle can only rely on the strength of its own people to overcome all difficulties. It cannot hope that others will work hard for itself. Unfortunately, the attitude of the so-called emerging writers and everything they describe are all immersed in the nightmare of hoping that others will find a way out for themselves. This kind of psychology especially makes us feel cold for the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>There are now people advocating for a non-war movement in literature. War, at least in the modern age, is absolutely unavoidable. "Turning hostility into friendship" is just a daydream. When it comes to war, it cannot be said that it is necessarily evil or cursed. If it is fought for the sake of finding a way out for the nation, then war can also be praised. Moreover, judging from the current situation in China, it seems that we do not yet have the qualifications for "non-war."</p>

<h3>Literary Anecdotes</h3>
<p>Byron's Foot - Ping</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Byron's mother was a very impatient person, while his father was a dissolute and rogue nobleman who liked to run around outside and mess around with mistresses.</p>
<p>Byron's temperament was somewhat influenced by his parents' heredity, and his genius was also largely based on this temperament.</p>
<p>He came from a prominent British family, and his aristocratic appearance was enough to boast of the poet's feelings. However, he was a clubfoot, which was the greatest regret of his life.</p>
<p>This, from his childhood, he thought was the most painful thing.</p>
<p>As for why he had a clubfoot, there are two theories. One says it was congenital, and the other believes that he was injured by his mother's recklessness. But to this day, no one knows which theory is correct.</p>
<p>His cool poet's eyes, golden hair, pure white skin, especially his loud and sonorous voice, made everyone who heard it feel happy. So when he was studying at university, everyone called him "Mr. Sweet Sound." He had so many commendable qualities, but unfortunately, he was a clubfoot, so it is no wonder that he thought it was the greatest regret of his life.</p>
<p>When he walked on the road as a child, people often shouted from behind,</p>
<p>"Oh, a beautiful child, but unfortunately, a clubfoot!"</p>
<p>Born with a sensitive nature, he could not get along with his mother, who suffered from severe "hysteria." Whenever his mother got angry, she would throw whatever was at hand at him. As a child, he never resented his mother's barbaric behavior. The irritable mother never thought about what kind of affection she should show to her child.</p>
<p>"Idiot, don't you know you're a clubfoot?"</p>
<p>When he heard such scolding from his mother, he could no longer bear it and replied with tears in his eyes,</p>
<p>"But, Mother, why did you give birth to me like this?"</p>
<p>What a sad and painful reply! Once, because he quarreled with his mother too fiercely, he tried to commit suicide with a small knife. Thus, we can know that his later fiery nature was all cultivated from his sensitive childhood.</p>
<h3>Biography of Hardy Published</h3>
<p>There was originally a biography of our great poet Hardy called "The Early Life of Hardy," which was published the year before last. Now another book called "The Later Life of Hardy" has been published, which of course continues the previous one. Those who fervently admire Hardy will find this book very welcome among them, but the general public will not feel much interest in it. The events recorded in it are too trivial. Hardy's daily movements, the people he met, when he took up his pen to write, his daily thoughts and observations, are all recorded one by one. We can see the meaning of these to Hardy himself from his works. However, this book also has its advantages. It can make us understand everything about Hardy, understand his comfortable and fortunate life, and the conflict between his observation of life as a tragedy and his enthusiasm. Moreover, this book also contains several extremely valuable photographs of Hardy, which are not easily seen by outsiders. (Mei Yun)</p>
<h3>Tolstoy and Twenty-Eight</h3>
<p>Tolstoy was born on August 28, 1828. The first volume of his first work, "Boyhood," was published on the 28th. He asked Miss Su Fei'ai for marriage on the 28th. The birth of his eldest son was also on the 28th, and one of his sons got married on the 28th. The day he left home at the age of eighty-two was also the 28th in the Russian calendar.</p>
<p>Although Tolstoy rejected all superstition, he always felt that the number 28 had a deep relationship with him and was affected by it. (Ping)</p>

<p>Swimming Performance at Jiaotong University</p>
<p>On the day of the graduation ceremony of Jiaotong University in Xujiahui, there were also many sports performances to add to the fun during the day. Among the various performances, I thought swimming was the most interesting, because in the summer, under the scorching sun, it is not very natural to do any exercise. Running and jumping will make you sweat all over, and fatigue will soon follow the sweat. Gradually, you will have no energy. How can there be an exquisite performance? But swimming is different. In the hot air, we run into the cool water world, which is really more energetic the more we play. Not only do the performers not sweat, but the audience watching by the pool also feels refreshed. No wonder they never get tired of watching it.</p>
<p>Look, Xu Yaotang is getting more and more energetic as he swims. Four hundred yards, one hundred-yard breaststroke, one hundred-yard backstroke, fancy diving, all come. Although the results are not very good, it is precisely his great spirit. Sports instructor Mr. Chen runs around, calling names, moving benches, and is really busy. Mr. Li Feiyun was temporarily hired to give orders and reports. Mr. Li's report, a mixture of northern and southern dialects, is really funny and makes people laugh.</p>
<h3>Pan Fengxian (Ruo Bing), Graduate of Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School</h3>
<p>Finally, there was fancy diving, led by Mr. Li with a group of more than ten people. The fancy styles were novel, and each had its own strengths. Especially Mr. Li's diving method is commendable. In addition, students Chen Zhenxian and Gao Qixun, and our instructor Chen, are also first-class experts. The performance did not end until four o'clock. A photo was taken by the press photographer as a souvenir. A water show finally came to a close (Ping)</p>
<h3>Is Russell's "Marriage Revolution" Idealistic? - Yuan Yuan</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, Mr. Yang Xingfo gave a lecture on sex problems at the Youth Association. I was fortunate enough to attend the last seat and learned a lot. However, I have some doubts about his statement that Russell's "Marriage Revolution" is idealistic. The following are Mr. Yang's words: "Now American scholar Lindsay and British Russell each have remedies. Lindsay's method is that after men and women get married, their finances are independent and whether they live together or not is up to them. The second method—Russell's method—is that divorce is possible, but there is no economic relationship, unlike Chinese women, who always want to make a fortune once they get divorced, asking for tens of thousands of yuan. The first method removes the economic panic, and such a combination is very pure and easy to last, a true lifelong friendship. However, this method is impossible in China because Chinese women are mostly unable to be economically independent. As for Russell's method, although it has little to do with economic problems, it has a great relationship with the moral problems of men and women. … What he advocates is love rather than hate and jealousy, freedom for each person rather than monopoly. Lindsay advocates historical materialism, while Russell advocates historical idealism."</p>
<p>We really don't know what Mr. Yang's words are based on.</p>
<p>Why say that? Is it because Russell "advocates love rather than hate and jealousy" that is the basis for his historical idealism? If this is the foundation of historical idealism, then Lindsay's position can also be said to be historical idealism because there is no lack of love in the sexual relationship advocated by Lindsay.</p>
<p>In fact, rather than saying that Russell's position on "Marriage Revolution" is idealistic, it is better to say that it is "vitalistic." Anyone who has read "Marriage Revolution" knows that according to Russell, the only reason for marriage is the issue of race. Also, Russell is very opposed to "idealism." He said, "Once a couple has children, then they—if they are responsible and have a love for their offspring—must feel that the most important thing is no longer the feelings between the two of them." In short, what he pays attention to is race rather than the tender feelings that Mr. Yang said are "invisible, untraceable, as if they do not exist"—or love. Therefore, in Chapter 6 of "Marriage Revolution," he spares no effort to launch a major attack on romantic love.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the value of Russell's "Marriage Revolution" lies in leaving "idealism" and focusing on "vitalism." Russell is a social reformer, and it is appropriate for him to focus on "vitalism." Therefore, it is truly a great injustice to regard Russell as an "idealist." This is to discuss with Mr. Yang.</p>
<h3>Chengcong Literary Society</h3>
<p>Recently, a group of students organized a literary society, taking the meaning of "the sound of gold and jade" from "chengcong," calling it the Chengcong Literary Society. The publication it produces is called "Congcong." We might as well talk about its history. It originated in the Nanyang Middle School, which has a history of more than 30 years. Nanyang Middle School is its stronghold. In addition, members are all over the place. Schools such as Pudong, Jinan, Minli, Fudan, Guanghua, Jiaotong, and Jianguo all have traces of its members. Previously, it was a bulletin board, but now it has been changed to a regular publication. It is said that the inaugural issue is already in print. (Zi Wei)</p>

<h3>Quick Report Introduction</h3>
<p>"Rural Economy" Xie Man</p>
<p>Written by Kawada Tsugiro, Translated by Chen Datong and Lu Shanzhi</p>
<p>Our country claims to be an agricultural nation, but what is the actual state of Chinese agriculture?</p>
<p>Although we cannot dogmatically say that Chinese agriculture is bankrupt, at the very least, we can say with a clear conscience that it is corrupt. This is undeniable from both subjective and objective perspectives. The facts are so fully and clearly presented that over 80% of the Chinese population works hard all year round, yet suffers from hunger and cold. The farmers, toiling with their hands and feet, are not only subject to exploitation by local bullies and gentry, bandits, and hoodlums, but also, the countries of the East and West are using their scientific omnipotence to increase production, thereby placing Chinese farmers in a situation of utter destruction.</p>
<p>The slogan of relieving the suffering of the people has been promoted quite well on the surface in recent years, but there are no concrete methods for actually relieving it. In the past, although many farmers' movements have been carried out, there is a lack of research books in terms of theory, and even fewer survey statistics in practice. Even if one wants to research and investigate, one often suffers from a lack of standards to start with.</p>
<p>The author of this book, Kawada Tsugiro, is a famous professor of economics in Japan. We can also recognize him as a Japanese socio-economist. The book not only has clear research in terms of theory, but also the investigation statistics of various implementations are also very clear.</p>
<p>This book is divided into three parts. The first part can be regarded as an explanation of economics, which describes the expression of economics, the relationship between economics and economic behavior, economic behavior and economic institutions, economic institutions and economic organizations, economic organizations and capitalist economics, the two inseparable facts in economics, the origin of "economics," and the materialist view of history and social change. The second part is a formal exploration of the rural economy, detailing the opposition between urban and rural areas and the exploitation of industry and commerce, the income and expenditure status of rural areas (including the assets of each farming household, the valuation of each farming household's assets, the income and expenditure of owner-farmers, the income and expenditure table of owner-tenant farmers, the income and expenditure of tenant farmers), the comparison between industry and commerce and agriculture, the economy of rice farming (the calculation of tenants and the investigation of various prefectures and counties, the difficulty of investigating farm household economics - the average harvest of rice farming in Japan, the capital used as direct production cost expenditure, the capital indirectly burdened as production cost, the rice farming income and expenditure calculation table), rural finance, rural finance. finance, rural finance, and the third part explores various problems of rural economy, based on the relationship between the changes in economics and rural economic problems studied (and discovered) in fact, in the tenant rent problem, the production distribution of tenants, the tenant rent problem and the labor wage problem, the distribution of rent harvest from labor wage calculation, the discussion of field rent from the landlord's perspective, the connection between financial institutions and tenant rent problems, and the maintenance of tenant rent problems and legal problems. In the proposition of the relationship between rural economy and politics, the connection between tenant rent problems and politics, the election of members and various political problems, dangerous thoughts and social transformation are clarified, and in the relationship between rural economic problems and finance, the activities of human beings and the application of capital, the tasks of financial institutions, and the influence of the financial world on the family villages are explained in more detail.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the production of this book was due to the fact that Japan's rural economy was approaching a huge crisis. This book has its contribution, its strength, its meaning, its value, and its position in the face of the crisis in Japan's situation. In Japan's rural society, this book naturally needs to be published.</p>
<p>As far as I know, this book was welcomed by the general rural areas in Japan, which was almost in a tragic state of financial bankruptcy in rural areas, and gave great assistance to the rural areas. In our China, although the state of the rural economy is different in nature, different in form, and different in background compared with Japan, the pain and blows suffered in the rural economy are not far apart.</p>
<p>I believe that under the circumstances that the problem of rural economy in China has become the only urgent problem, this book can at least help the development of China's agricultural movement, I believe that it can at least remind me of the urgent route of China's agricultural movement.</p>
<h3>The Passionate Widow Wen Juan</h3>
<p>Written by Austrian Schnitzler, Translated by Shi Zhecun</p>
<p>People all know that Schnitzler is a doctor, so his novels are best at psychological descriptions. It can be said that nine out of ten of this "Passionate Widow" is an extremely profound psychological analysis. The content is roughly like this:</p>
<p>The protagonist, Berta, is a nervous woman. She loves music and once had the ambition to become a young artist, but she was dragged away by the palm of the environment, forcing her to give up the depiction of a happy life in the future, and also abandoning the love of a young violinist, and finally fell into the arms of a mediocre person, living a blind married life for three years. After that, she became a widow. Her nature made her willing to be a proper woman and a good mother to her child, but her soul, which had never been entrusted, finally disturbed her, forcing her to fall into a realm of fantasy and boredom. Light actually came. She discovered the portrait of Emil, her lover from twelve years ago, the violinist, on a newspaper. Confusion immediately invaded her, and the memories of the past rose in her heart.</p>
<p>"She couldn't help but think of one evening, after class at the Conservatory of Music, she and Emil were walking in the city garden. That time he had sat down to rest beside her, and he had stroked her cheek with his gentle fingers. Had this only happened once? No, it often happened. They had sat together in that seat a dozen or twenty times, and he had stroked her cheek. At this moment, all these things came back to her mind. How strange it was." When she first returned to Vienna, she had consciously looked for the place in the park where she used to walk with Emil. This passage of psychological description is well worth reading. "She was annoyed by this confusion, thinking back to when she was young and carefree, walking idly on these garden paths. She felt that she had declined a lot since then, and had become so pitiful. Her thought of sitting in the front row seat of the concert seemed very presumptuous and almost impossible. So thinking about it, it seemed absolutely impossible for Emil Linherbart to still recognize her. Really, it seemed almost impossible for him to even remember that she existed... It seemed that the farther he flew, the more unattainable he became, and the more she felt sad. For a moment, it seemed incomprehensible to her that she had abandoned her lover, thrown away her hope of living an artist's life, and gone to mix with mediocre people, living a life of darkness." What kind of strength helped her, after returning from Vienna, she resolutely wrote him a letter. Things went very smoothly, and soon they met. How infatuated she was, how she confided in him, how she hoped that he would propose to her, and establish their eternal and exclusive love. However, Emil said:</p>
<p>"I think we should let it remain unresolved." Her slight disappointment could not stop her passion for him. Finally, in Emil's arms, she lost her usual dignified character and became his mistress.</p>
<p>In fact, her infatuation would not receive a corresponding reward. Emil's wish was only a moment of pleasure. He refused her request to visit him at home, and coldly rejected her hope of moving to Vienna to live, causing the passionate widow to feel great sorrow and regret, and this book ended.</p>
<p>The author's attitude towards life is very pessimistic. In this "Passionate Widow," love is also written as exceptionally tragic. He assumed the Rubius couple, alluding to Berta and her deceased husband. Mrs. Rubius was driven to death after losing her chastity, leaving behind a fatherless child for her paralyzed husband to raise. He was also afraid that the reader would not understand his intentions, so he wrote such sentences when Berta visited - or perhaps it could be said that she was seeing Mrs. Rubius off - at her bedside.</p>
<p>"She thought to herself, what would Emil say if she suddenly died? Ah, it would definitely make him feel a little sad, if he could think of her, whom he had held in his arms a few days ago, now sleeping in the tomb and rotting... Now who is in the bad situation</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>[H The Republic of China, July 19th year &gt;</p>
<p>This woman who is destined to die, or Berta herself." Rubius is the incarnation of Berta, which is very obvious here.</p>
<p>The tone of the book is dark and depressing from beginning to end. He sets off Berta's gray life, lined with her contradictory and scattered state of mind, and every word is full of the tragedy of life. After reading this book, people will always sigh and say, "Love is originally like this. What a infatuated woman pursues and obtains often cannot escape the same fate as this heroine. Not only romantic artists are like this, or perhaps this is precisely the common rule of men's love." The author seems to be using all his strength to describe the heroine Berta, but writes very vaguely about Emil. Perhaps such a vague artist is the symbol of love in the world. Love is originally just an illusion, and at a certain period, this illusion is bound to disappear. The author's sharp observation is indeed after seeing through life, that he has this kind of almost extremely pessimistic writing.</p>
<p>Mr. Klingman, who appears at the beginning of the book, can be said to be a portrayal of Emil's inner life. Berta was able to reject Mr. Klingman's seduction, but was unable to accept Emil's passionate infatuation. This is also the sorrow of all passionate women, not just Berta. However, the author cleverly made them meet again, becoming an interesting contrast.</p>
<p>This translation has a total of 294 pages and about 100,000 words. The translation is also very detailed. It is a more satisfactory publication in the recent translation world.</p>
<h3>The Story of World Literature (1) (7) (6)</h3>
<p>Written by John Macy, USA</p>
<p>Chapter 46: Scandinavian Literature Translated by Hu Zhongchi Translated by Hu Zhongchi</p>
<p>In this era, that is, in the early 19th century, there were many truly outstanding lyric poets and prose writers. The most famous prose writer and poet was Frederika Bremer. Her novels "Sketches of Everyday Life," "The H Family," "The Neighbors," "The President's Daughters," etc., captured the hearts of her countrymen. Through Mary Howitt's excellent translation, it also spread to the English-speaking world. Those novels are sentimental, but that sentimentality is not annoying. She is as honest as George Sand, but much less interesting. She is a strong advocate of women's liberation, but fortunately, that beautiful fanaticism has not damaged her story.</p>
<p>Miss Bremer is Finnish. Runeberg, the first Swedish poet in the middle of the same century, is also Finnish, not from blood, but from birthplace. He wrote the most about the main material of Finland, and spent most of his life in Finland. He won extraordinary fame. He was originally an unknown teacher at a small university in Finland. He became the most prominent laureate poet of Sweden in modern Swedish poetry, second only to Tengner, and first after Tengner's death. His lyrical poems have the most English translations.</p>
<p>In the middle of the same century, Swedish prose lacked vitality. Compared with Norway and Denmark, Sweden was backward. Until the end of the same century, due to the influence of French realism, Norwegian drama represented by Ibsen, and Danish criticism represented by Brandes, a period of academic revival was born. The most eye-catching figure in the new literature is Strindberg, a genius with great power and eccentricity. According to the story, Ibsen looked at the portrait of Strindberg and said, "This is a more outstanding figure than me." Ibsen and Strindberg were completely different in their views on life. In Ibsen's most wonderful plays, women have an independent spirit. Even if liberation is not realized, she always strives for liberation. On the contrary, Strindberg is a fierce opponent of the liberation movement and a hater of women. In his last novel "The Red Room," which depicts the lives of poor and struggling artists and authors, it is always women who bring about the destruction of men. His "Married Life," a collection of short stories that meticulously attacks women and marriage, has lost its effect as art. Strindberg's works are very uneven. At their lowest, they are rough and immature, and at their highest, they reach the highest poetic beauty. One characteristic runs through its entirety, which is that unreserved honesty, that will to see the truth of things and record them without fear.</p>
<p>The contrast to Strindberg is Selma Lagerlöf, the most outstanding woman in Sweden. She has a gentle, sympathetic fantasy. The book that made her famous and that she never surpassed is "The Saga of Gösta Berling." A book that is pleasant for children - and adults - is "Nils' Wonderful Journey." This would have pleased Hans Christian Andersen. It tells the adventures of a young man riding on the back of a wild goose and flying over Sweden. Selma Lagerlöf became a world figure. Her books have been translated into many languages, most of which have been translated into English. She is highly praised and respected in her country and is the only woman elected to the Swedish Academy. There is also a famous woman, Ellen Key, who is more of a philosopher and critic than an artist, and who occupies a very important position in modern Swedish literature. Her "Love and Marriage" and "The Century of the Child" are valuable contributions to questions of sex and education.</p>
<p>The most famous writer in Sweden is Heidenstam, an idealist who directly opposed Strindberg. He is a lyric poet of the first rank and an outstanding critic. In his prose romances, "Endymion" and "Hans Alienus," he shows the futility of realism. It is appropriate to play a romantic and idealistic tune here and leave the Scandinavian countries.</p>
