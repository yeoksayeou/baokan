<h3 id="c9">倫敦海軍公約簽字 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>此次倫敦海軍議。歴三閱月之時間。經若干次破裂之危險。費列强代表無數之口舌。而幸得成此文長六千字之海軍恊定。其主要條目。爲限制主力艦潛艇巡艦驅逐艦等五欵。前所喧傳之英美日三國協定。即包括於全部協定之内。有效時期規定至一九三六年底止。此倫敦海軍會議成功之一斑也。此次會議所以急轉直下而忽然成立協定者則以英美方面對於法意略有讓步。而意法之間。亦暫各表示諒解之故。至論此次成功之質量如何。則已大非開始會議時之所期望。蓋在倫敦會議之初。本希望繼續華府日内瓦等會議未竟之功。進一步以逹裁减軍備之目的。乃裁減不成。而言限制。限制之中。又復再三通融如最重要之第三欵内。規定簽字國於有效時期内。如爲國家安全需要。得通知增加噸數。此可見該協定苦心遷就之一斑矣。美屯有生云。此次所做到之海軍限制程度。可云最低地步。英麥唐納云。今所乾擬这協定。　爲在幾瀕絕境中覔得最後之一步骤。則此次會議所得結果之微。亦可於　氏言外見之。</p>
<p>然而此僅僅有限之成功。已覺喜出望外。在數日前。人人　會議必將破裂。今竟保全會議體面而歸豈非萬幸。惟以後則恐尙有問題。一爲此次所成立之海軍公約。果能通過於國内否。倘各國内部之軍人與他方面或不滿於該約起而反對。則又將發生事議。而所得結果。尙不可恃一爲限制造艦所餘之軍費。如若移作擴張其他軍備如航窜軍之用。則軍費之縮减。無異不縮减。如若移用於盡力振興工工商業。則在此財力困窮無法銷納之際。勢必競覔出路。爭奪商塲。國交又有破裂之虞。說者謂無論如何。在此規定之六年短期間内。决可保相安無事。不致發生戰爭。然勿論此六年之期間。怱怱易過。即在此六年内。各國經濟之利害衝突如何。互相猜忌之心如何。種種競爭方法用盡後又將如何則又非今日所能預計也。</p>

<p>的年齡、歐洲中部如法國比國的人發育稍遲一點、他們規定、結婚的年齡男子是十八女子是十六歲、歐洲的北部如挪威瑞典等國、氣候寒冷、發育較遲、他們規定結婚的年齡男子日二十一歲女子是十八歲、這些地方所定的結婚年齡、雖是根據他們地方的情形、人民身體發育遲早的關係、但是終不免有武斷之處、兄弟方才聲明過、今天提出這婚姻問題來、是供大家討論的、個人並没有絕對的主張、單就結婚的年齡說、主張遲婚的人以爲結婚年齡太低、於經濟上人種上都有很大的害處、尤其是在經濟方面關係更大、因爲人種方面、在世界科學家認爲還没有甚麽重大關係、不過結婚太遲的害處、也是很多、譬如、一個男子、他到十五歲已經發育完全了、然而在法律上他非到二十歲不能結婚、他在這五年裏頭究竟是怎麽樣、我們研究科學不要自已騙自已、試問這男子能不能守身如玉到二十歲哩、恐怕形式上雖然没有和誰結婚、而事實上早已和人結婚了、如果一定叫他非到某年齡不得爲形式上的結婚、事實上他一定要亂來的、像這個問題、也是經我們研究認爲解决不了的、各國想解决這個問題便有人著作了許多學說、然而都是空論、並没有實行、可見這個問題實在是不易解决的、以上兄弟所舉出的機點、都是我們應該研究、而研究起來、又極感困難的、因爲這些問題和風俗習慣社會經濟的關係、甚爲密切、此外還有許多的困難問題、都已經胡院長提交中央政治會議去解决了、即如親屬的結婚應該如何的限制、以及夫妻的財產問題、妾的問題、家的問題、及繼承上遺產遺囑的問題等、應該如何的規定、這都是親屬繼承兩編的立法原則、祇好等政治會議决定之後、我們再根據起草、還有人說、親屬繼承兩編旣然關係風俗習慣社會經濟、如此重大、若是暫時不起草、好不好呢、在我們負起草責任的一方面說、暫時休息休息、原没有什麽不好、但是主張暫不起草的人、是根據什麽理由呢、他們以爲中國情形變遷很快、不必定一個永久的法律、譬如婚姻問題、就是没有法子辦的、拿上海廣州來說、這類問題近年來比較各國變遷的還要快、據上海法院的統計、一百件案子裏總有五十多件是離婚的、這種情形、已經跑美國以情慾爲結婚目的上去了、在這樣地方的人、他們的結婚觀念差不多是没有嗣續和家庭的目的、完全以美國結婚的觀念爲觀念的、但是在鄕村的人還是要維持嗣續觀念、他們是墨守舊習、是輕易没有變遷的、這是城市和鄕村不同的地方、若以上海這種變遷來說、恐怕比歐洲各國還要走得快一些、而鄕村情形恐怕就再過幾十年、也不會像歐洲的樣子、我們現在立法、如果以城市爲標準、在鄕村就相離太遠、如果以鄕村爲標準、在城市也覺得不相宜、所以還是暫不起草、讓各地方習慣去支配的好、這種見解、表面上似乎也有相當的理由、不過同時要想一想、案件是不會因我們不定法律便不發生的、旣然發生、如一一都依習慣解决、是辦不通的、而且法律應該統一的、現在雖然走還没有定出這個法來、而在事實上也非統一不可、因爲此類案件、關係國家政策、同樣的案子、就不應不同樣的解决、即如最高法院番理案件、遇到兩個性質相同的案子、就不能因爲一個發生在志市、一個發生在鄕村、便有兩樣的判决、是以我們不起草、就永遠把這些困難、都擱在不解决之中、而這此問題都是關係原則的問題、由立法院起草、總覺得方便一點、因爲比較起來、以立法手段當然比以解釋法律的手段來解决這個問題爲妥當的、總之、以上兩個說法、主張不起草的有理由、主張起草的也有理由、現在祇好等政治會議議决了原則之後、再遵照辦理罷了、（完）</p>

<p>主席各位同志、此次開全國敎育會議、很想早來參觀、適中央有緊要人主議、分身不得、未能參加、大會及各組審查會、甚爲抱憾、此次全國敎育會議、比從前的會議、較有統系、各省代表到會者亦較齊整、各省縣市敎育局長、亦有參加、均爲本會議之優點、</p>
<p>敎部以經年之研究討論、根據中央所定中華民國敎育宗旨、制定此整個方案、兄弟祇閲讀一通覺得大體甚好、各位皆敎育專家、對於原案、定能有更好的修正、</p>
<p>貴會議有欲敎兄弟來說幾句話、現在祇就近來的感想、略事報告、或不免有武斷的地方、請各位指敎、</p>
<p>敎育兩字的意義需廣、專就名詞上說、中國從前祇有敎、敎育二字之連成、在孟子上見之、究其意義人類無時無刻不在生活中、即無時無刻不在敎育中、範圍甚廣、正如政治二字總理解釋政是衆人的事、治是治理衆人的事、人類無時無刻不在政治之中、範圍之廣相同、</p>
<p>時常聽有人說過「政敎分離」一語、案此語來源、</p>
<p>係對宗敎專制而定、在宗敎專制壓迫政治之時政治太受朿縛、發生政敎分離、之呼聲、流傳入於中國、亦曰政敎分離此於軍閥帝制之時、受武力之摧殘壓迫、求與政治分離、而不得之時、或尚可說、至於現在在原則上、事實上、均說不通、因此兩種在同一空間内、不能排一留一也、徵之各國儘以政敎分離爲標榜、但其實際、敎育不特不與政治相反、且適相成、而各成其獨立的學風、此因政治與敎育所要求者實相同也、其在中國政治宗旨、不外民族獨立民權普遍民生發展、敎育亦不外此</p>
<p>此次敎育會議之目的、將確定敎育方針、一洗以前敎育荒廢因循之舊、注重在方案之實施、不特政敎不能分離、且處處有密切關係、政離於敎、則政不成爲政、敎離於政、則敎亦不成其爲敎也、訓政時期各種建設事業、常感學術之未發達、人才之未養成、即政不能離敎之明證、民國肇造、未經過訓政時期、主權在民、人民未有認識、議員爲人收買、人民視爲不生關係、所謂訓政、就字面講、訓即是敎、四權之訓楝、訓政時期之所重、亦敎育之事也、政治不能與敎育分開之重要如此、</p>
<p>再講到敎育方面、敎育如離開政治則不能完成、</p>
<p>所謂理想的新村、蔣部長曾說過、此次敎育方政、必得政治安定、經費充裕才可推行、亦足見敎育不聖離開政治而獨立也、</p>
<p>近幾年來、兄弟覺得敎育上有一大缺點、即外國人之短處、往往向中國人輸進、如來一杜威、其實用主義的敎育、發展兒童本位的敎育、流傳至於中國、學生競尙自由、以廢止考試相號召、風潮疊起、甚爲憾事、中國過去之敎育朴作敎刑、固屬不當、但自杜氏之說輸入中國、不免矯枉過正、學生習於浪漫、甚至有「打倒不告假的敎習、」的口號的發生、敎育投機取巧、拐買靑年、投其所好、以打倒宗法封建及資本主義等、爲其投機之護符、流弊所及、學風頓壞、至於不可收拾、因此敎育不得不加以嚴格、學生應否有紀律應認爲吾人合理的要求、座使靑年深能了解保持紀律之必要、即保持紀律、乃羣衆對於社會之義務、</p>
<p>吾人對敎育政策、不可畏人攻擊、即如主張嚴格敎育自不免爲主張、自由主義、敎育如杜威之徒所評論、不過吾人對於西洋敎育學說之觀察、杜威也好、期賓塞也子、不過太講自由、太講無政府、對於現在社會、現在已成的中國社會、恐辦不通、不得不加以反對也、即若根據杜氏兒童爲本位之敎育學說、擴而充之、則敎育部長須聽敎育廳長命令敎育廳長應聽學校校長命、校長敎職員應聽從學生命令、如學生一致指揮敎職員闖入、敎育部來、便可闖入敎部來、尙復成體統、</p>
<p>各國中學校、多尙嚴格、中學畢業者已能完成其公民人格、大學畢業者、往往專從一師、專習一業、學問之增進、即於此時爲特多、蓋猶有我國古代設帳講學之遺風焉、至若我國大學畢業學生、一出學校、師生關係至爲淺薄、蓋有憾焉、</p>
<p>吾人應視敎育爲神聖事業、政治方面、如視敎育爲無足輕重、敎育經費、無足重視、或持富而後敎之說、以爲敎育敎費可以緩付、殊屬不當、中國地大物博、所以不富者、即由於無敎所致、若待富而後敎、則國家且亡、尙有何用、</p>
<p>從事敎育者亦應視敎育爲最神聖之事業、最受種種困難、甚至犧牲亦所不惜、歐戰以前、大學敎授之薪俸、不及一勞動家、但敎育家深能認識爲敎育而敎育之　　、物質上之報酬、遠不若精神上之報酬爲重要　、總之政治方面、對於敎育、應設法爲之保障、敎育方面、應就被敎者方面看想、納於正軌、庶幾有成功焉、�</p>
<p>中國中學不良、爲中國敎育之致命傷、是否三三制之失敗、當三三制之初興、一方思提高中學程度、一主欲與大學銜接、原意甚善、但實際方面均未能做到、現制高中職業科較之從前甲種實業學校、反有不如、有子女之家庭、因經濟之不能担負、大學敎育用費、希望子弟在中學畢業後能就業者占多數、大中小學固應有銜接之要求、但同時亦應在銜接之原則中爲多數不銜接之擬就業者着想、充實高中分科計劃、吾人於此應特加注意焉、</p>
<p>以上的說、不過就感想所及拉雜說來、以供各位參考、同時希望各位加以指正、</p>

<h3 id="c98">皖敎廳代表楊中明談話 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>▲皖省敎育詳情</p>
<p>▲共分七大項目</p>
<p>安徽敎育廳代表楊中明氏、現在該廳第三科科長兼第四科科長、於十五日深夜抵京、寓中央飯店、記者前曾往訪、據謂此次敎育會議、程廳長原擬親自出席、藉與諸大敎育家切實磋商敎育上實際問題嗣因兼代主席職務、忙劇異常、爰囑代表出席、因於日前奉省政府委派赴杭參觀全國運動大會、甫於十三日過京回皖、十四日又由皖來京、途中以輪船誤時、故未及參加開幕典禮、并談安徽敎育情形甚詳、爰將楊氏談話、分項述之於下、</p>
<p>（一）敎育經費</p>
<p>皖省省敎育經費、原由省庫地方稅劃撥月以十萬元爲度、迨民國十年姜高琦案發生後、乃由九十五萬增至一百五十三萬、但常受財政影響、未能按照預算發給、實支仍不過一百二十萬元、十六年四月、國民革命軍底定安徽、同政務委員會議决、將民國十二年所指定爲學欵之捲烟稅實充敎育經費、同年七月中央財政會議議决捲烟稅收、歸中央統辦改以田賦作敎費、經敎育界力爭、由省政府商准財政部按月由捲烟稅項下劃撥三成爲敎育經費、迨十三年二月財政部對於捲烟稅徽收辦法、改由入口時一次統徵、各省不得再得抽收、於是皖省敎費、又受動搖、復經敎育界全體力爭、並由省府委派財敎兩廳長來京商榷坻補辦法、幾經磋商、財部乃允月撥經費十萬元作抵不足之數、仍由省地方稅撥足自程廳長蒞任後、各項敎育事業、均經逐漸擴充、敎育經費、亦由一百三十五萬元、增籌至一百七十萬元連同省立大學經費七十萬元、每年實支二百四十萬元之鉅、一年來尙無積欠、殊不容易至各縣敎育經費、大都支絀、最多者不逾十萬最少乃不及三千元、其來源率多出自學田及田賦附加、自韓前廳長積極淸理程廳長努力增籌後、除少數縣分尙未塡報外、其總數遂由五十四萬餘元、增至一百十餘萬元、其外爲推行義務敎育計、於民國十一年全省敎育行政會議决議帶征田畝牲屠牙帖不動産登記及烟酒厘金六項附加爲義務敎育專欵、惟各縣以年歲荒歉或受軍事影響請求減免或暫緩施行者亦復不少、</p>
<p>（二）高等敎育</p>
<p>案徽大學先於十七年春季招考預科、是爲大學創立之始、是年秋招生開辦文法兩學院、十八年春經省府接收改組、定名爲案徽省立大學聘程廳長兼任校長、擬訂各項章則、增購圖書儀器并籌備理學院、暑假期中、程廳長辭去校長兼職、由省政府聘王星拱先生爲校長、增加經費、并正式招收理科學生、去年下學期共有敎職員一三三人、學生四○一人、至留學敎育、安徽分省費生及獎學金生兩種、省費生學額計有三十二名奬學金生則有七十名、前者年給之學費、視所在國而不同、後者年給之津貼、約占省費生學費之半數、十七年冬程廳長蒞任後、卷查皖省歐美省費留學生考試、外未舉行、而近年留學生畢業回國者、亦有缺額多名、急待補派、爰於去年七月舉行留學生考試共取學生七名、均已次第放洋、復按照自費留學生獎學規程、先後核補東西洋獎學金生約二十名、此外津貼國内國立大學及敎部立案之私立著名大學院皖籍優秀學生年計一百八十名、每人年獎一百十元、</p>
<p>（三）中等敎育</p>
<p>安徽省立中等學校、自十六年改組後、計有中學六所、初中一所女中四所、在籌備中的女中二所、中等職業學業五所、程廳長蒞任後、力謀擴充、將蕪湖初中擴充爲第七中學、第五第六女子中等、亦經先後正式成立、又在蚌埠設第四中等職業學校、在貴池添設鄕村師範學校、統計現在省立中等學校、共有二十所、一百四十二班、連同公私立中等學校共有六十四所、二百八十四班、所有經費佔全部敎育經費百分之六十、</p>
<p>（四）初等敎育</p>
<p>省敎育事業項下、除各中學之實騐小學及安慶市各小學原係省欵、由敎育廳直轄外、其餘楓由各縣辦理、依照去年春季調查、除兩縣未塡報外、計學校總數爲三千三百六十九所、學生數爲十二萬一千○八十八名、一年來積極推廣、爲數當不止此、關於小學師資事項、已舉行檢定小學黨義敎師并師規定小學校、應儘先聘用師範畢業生、關於調查學齡兒童事項、除省會業經辦理完竣外、其他各縣均在積極進行、關於黨童子軍敎育事項、除調查各市縣組織狀况并頒發各項規程外、省會各小學童子軍曾經幾度檢閲和表演成績頗有可觀、此外如幼稚敎育的推廣小學敎育研究、會的組織、以及其他各項敎育事業統計的編製、均在積極進行中、</p>
<p>（五）義務敎育</p>
<p>本年度的工作、關於行政方面、訂定各市縣義務敎育委員會組織大綱、通飭各市縣趕速組織義務敎育委員會、關於經費方面、訂定義務敎育附稅徵收保管及支配規程、俾鄭重義敎專欵、關於</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>師資方面、訂義敎師資養成所規程及檢定　師暫行規程、以資造就義敎師資、關於研究及計劃方面、有編定安徽厲行義務敎育意見書、研究調查學齡兒童方法、預定安徽厲行義務敎育全部工作槪要、此外如鄕村師範的增設、義敎經費的增籌均是本年義敎進行事項、</p>
<p>（六社會敎育）</p>
<p>社會敎育省辦者有通俗敎育館三所、分設安慶蕪湖蚌埠三處、就中以第一通俗敎育館規模較大、内分推廣圖書、博物游藝體育五部、並兼辦市立影戲院兒童游樂塲民衆閲報處、民衆學校等事業、省立圖書館一所、亦設於安慶、所藏中西書籍、爲數甚夥、此外關於各縣所設社會敎育機關、計有三十六縣六十六所、大都因爲經費關係不易發展、現訂定凡縣立社會敎育機關開辦滿二年成績優良而經費欠缺者、得由省欵量予補助、</p>
<p>（七）民衆敎育</p>
<p>在十七年秋、韓前廳長爲推廣民衆敎育、造就民衆學校師資計、曾辦民衆敎育師範訓練所、令各縣保送小學敎師及富有民衆敎育興趣者兩人來所研究、程廳長蒞任後完成其工作、並修正安徽省市縣民衆敎育委員會組織大綱、令飭各縣組織民衆敎育委員會、積極推行、現查已成立民衆敎育委員會者有四十四縣、各縣民衆學校最多有四十一所、此外本廳及省城各機關公務人員、亦辦民衆學校甚夥、以資提倡、</p>
<p>總之、一年來安徽敎育、鮮不力圖整頓、與擴充除上所述者外、如召集全省敎育局長會議、省立中等學校校長會議、舉行敎育局長考試、歐美留學生考試、開辦暑期學校及暑期學術講演會、檢定黨義敎師、舉行全省學生演說競賽會、全省運動會、並繼續辦理第四届華中運動會、又謂敎育研究會以供研究、謂成績展覽會以資觀摩、如從此進行不懈、則素號敎育落後之安徽人、或有來蘇之望、</p>
<h3 id="c99">衛生敎育　金寳善 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>▲須注重健康敎育</p>
<p>▲造就中小學師資</p>
<p>▲應規定敎材標準</p>
<p>前日第四次大會、討論初等敎育計劃案中、關於第九條衛生敎育問題、金寳善主張應有特殊訓練、俾養成適當人才當時韋慤俞子夷均附其議、將金之意見書送大會編纂科修訂等事、已見昨報、茲將金君意見書探錄如後、</p>
<p>衛生敎育、爲自歐戰以後世界一種新運動、蓋以近代衛生家與敎育家認爲健康與敎育、相互爲用不容或間、敎育即生命、而健康則爲使個人生活富有最大社會供獻之生命狀態、大戰時、各國從軍者之身體檢查、發現許多身體缺陷足以證明以法令促進健康效力之薄弱、而知生活豐富使有最大之社會供獻者、全持個人方面之習慣、態度與欣賞也、惟欲達到此項目的、則非敎育不爲功、健康爲敎育最要目的之一、已爲世界敎育家所公認、世界敎育會聯合會、於其成立之始、即有健康敎育組之設置、名地公私衞生敎育機關、近數年來、關於衛生敎育之試騐、表演、研究、以及人材之造就、如雨後之春筍、凡欲求進步之國家、實難自外於此種與人類有深長意義之運動、</p>
<p>衛生敎育在吾國、較之他國、更爲需要、一般民衆之無知與迷信、實爲今日不良健康狀况之重要原因、凡經濟之窮困、科學醫藥之缺乏、交通之不便、土地之遼闊、與夫人口之衆多、均非從敎育着手、不能使健康狀况有所改良、僅持法令、實難普及於全體民衆、退一步言之假令民衆無相當之敎育、以感覺健康之需要、及了解其價値則一切公共衛生之建設、亦均不能有其基礎、吾國死亡原因之最大者、爲腸胃傳染病、在其他文明國家、此種疾病、幾已藉公共衛生之設施完全撲滅、而在吾國、一班衛生之建設、爲經濟狀况所不許、且科學醫師之數目、如此之少、除由個人敎育、使一班民衆知所避免外、更無其他較善之方法、據此一端、已足證明衛生敎育、在吾國之格外重要也、</p>
<p>習慣態度、及欣賞之養成、須自幼年起始、自不待言、故學校内衛生之設施、實爲衛生敎育主要之步驟、因此、國民政府敎育部、於其最近頒布之中小學課程標準内、已將衛生一科列入、惟師資與敎材、尙爲重要之問題、若無相當之解决、則中小學良好衛生敎育之設施、爲不可能也、查過去各中小學校擔任衛生敎育者、類皆缺乏專門訓練而敎授方法及其所用敎材、大都偏重人體生理及解剖、關於衛生習慣、保健、防病各項之意義及訓練、則多未注意實未合於現代衛生敎育之趨向欲圖根本改善、則師資之造就敎材標準之確定、均屬急要之務、</p>
<p>造就中小學之師資、應在師範學校高中師範科及鄕村師範或師範講習所之課程内、將衛生敎育一科、列入爲必修科、至造就中等師範之師資、應在大學敎育學院師範學院設立衛生敎育系或衛生敎育專修科、茲擬各級衛生敎育師資造就之系統表如左、</p>
<p>衛生敎育師資系統表</p>
<p>初中衛生課程</p>
<p>衛生敎育系　高中師範科衛生敎育課程</p>
<p>大學研究院　大學敎育院師範學院　　　　　　　　　　　　　小學及幼稚園</p>
<p>衛生敎育專修科師範學校衛生敎育課程</p>
<p>鄕村師範衛生敎育課程　社會和自然課及其他各種課程均應包括健康敎育之意義</p>
<p>若爲適應現今需要之臨時辦法、則對此項現任或擬任中小學衛生課程之敎師、先作短期訓練如去年夏季敎育衛生兩部所辦之暑期衛生敎育講習會、以及今春北平市所辦之小學敎師衛生敎育講習會、聘請專家擔任講演及實騐、亦殊便易、各地敎育當局如能設法舉辦、其裨益衛生敎育前途、必非淺鮮至於敎材標準之規定、應注意左列各要點、</p>
<p>一、小學校之衛生課程、以養成兒童之衛生習慣爲主、關於生理解剖祇須略示數例、</p>
<p>二、初級中學之衛生課程除養成衛生習慣外、更及於人體生理解剖大意、及預防醫學、社會衛生等、</p>
<p>三、高級中學之衛生課程、須與公民學、生物學、家政學、體育等聯貫敎授、</p>
<p>中小學校衛生課程之詳細標準、在敎育部頒行之中小學課程暫行標準第一二兩册、已分别規定、（關於幼稚園及小學者見第一册六頁至八頁社會和自然課中四五頁至四七頁小學社會課中、與五四頁至五六頁小學自然課中、關於初中者見第二册一○三頁至一○八頁初中生理衛生暫行課程標準中、）可以參看、茲不復贅</p>
<p>高中師範科及師範學校、爲造就中小學師資之重要機關、對於衛生敎育一科尤當注重、其課程標準、曾與袁敦禮同志擬就請由敎育部提交課程標準委員會採用（標準草案從略）</p>
<p>大學敎育院及師範學院之衛生敎育專修科課程亦應酌量擬定、以作將來設施之張本、茲述其大要如下、必修科｜國文英文各六學分、生物學生理學各四學分、均三小時演講三小時實騐個人衛生四學分微生物學營養學各四學分均演講三小時、實騐二小時、衛生敎育六學分、敎育哲學敎學原理、敎育心理、體育各四學分、實習未定共五十六學分、選修科｜婦嬰及兒童衛生四學分精神衛生、家庭看護各二學分、及心理學、社會學、敎育行政、敎育測騐及統計體育原理、其他等科共選二十四學分、合共修足八十學分畢業</p>
<p>衛生敎育系課程（大學生得選衛生敎育爲主科或副科學門此種學程須視個人興趣而定、）只以下列三學科爲必修、一·個人衛生四學分二·公共衛生二學分、三·衛生敎育六學分、餘則就專修課程中其他學科選修之</p>
<p>大學研究院課程、凡與徫生敎育有關之學科均得研究之年限無定、</p>
<h3 id="c100">對師範敎育幾點意見　程天放 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>師範敎育的主旨在用適宜的科學敎育和嚴格的身心訓練、養成一般國民道德上和學術上的健全師資、所以師範敎育是一國敎育的根本、師範敎育制度在整個的學制系統中應佔着重要的位置、我國師範敎育、向來没有一種健全的制度、自從實行新學制後、師範敎育制度益復破碎支離、病態畢露、在十七年全國敎育會議中、整理師範敎育制度一案、爲大會中心問題之一、討論結果、雖大多數贊成「師範敎育獨立」的原則、並經議决「爲促成義務敎育起見」應由高中師範科外、由各省多設獨立之師範學校或師範講習所特别訓練小學師資」但對於整個的師範敎育制度和師範敎育的實施方案都還没有一種詳細的規定、所以全國敎育界矚目的師範敎育問題、終没有得到澈底的解决、現在、全國敎育會議又在首者開會了、這次全國敎育會議全部敎育方案的第三章是專述、「籌設各級各種師資訓練機關計劃」在那個計劃草案裏面、對於師範敎育的目標、期限·程度·年限·設校辦法、課程大要、實習辦法、服務和待遇、中小學敎師進行辦法、及職業科師資訓練辦法等都有種種精詳的計劃、而其最値得我們注意的一點、就是在此次方案中、師範敎育（即各級師資訓練機關）已成立一個整個的一貫的糸統、師範敎育獨立的精神已很顯著地表現出來、現在全敎大會已開會有日、對於師範敎育問題想當有更精密的討論、天放因事未能親與盛會、謹將個人平日對於師範敎育的幾點意見、略述於後以供參考、</p>
<p>（一）對於師範敎育制度的意見</p>
<p>（一）師範敎育負着培養各級師資的使命、是各級敎育的根本、所以各級的師範敎育應自成一個獨立的完整的糸統、以免漫無標準、内容紛歧、　　（二）師範敎育係國家的事業　係敎育建國的重要工具、其設立學校地點、培養師資人數、奬勵師資政策、及訓練師資辦法等、都應由政府按照時代和環境的需要而定、所以各級師範學校應絶對公家設立、以免各自爲政、失掉師範敎育的眞義、美國敎育家貝葛萊敎授ＰｒｏｉＢａｇｌｅｙ謂師範敎育行政宜以全國爲單位、至小亦應以一省爲單位、就是這個道理、</p>
<p>（三）在中等敎育叚、中學師範科及師範學校兩種制度、固可以並行而不悖、但各省至少應設立一所以上的完全師範學校、且今後各省縣增設師範學校亦應以單獨開辦爲原則、以期訓練集中、目標確定、易於養成師範生視敎育爲專業的興趣與態度、</p>
<p>（四）培養鄕村師資、爲推行鄕村敎育的先决問題所以今後各省市縣應普設鄕村師範學校、培養鄕村師資其經費固以由各縣市擔負爲原則、但中央及各省政府應查明各縣市財力的厚簿、給、</p>
<p>予充分的補助、</p>
<p>（二）對於師範學校課程的意見</p>
<p>（一）各級師範學校的課程、都應注意到兩方面、普通的訓練Ｇｅｎｅｒａｌｔｒａｉｎｉｎｇ（一）專業的訓練Ｐｒｏｆｅｓｓｉｏｎａｌｔｒａｉｎｉｎｇ和一種訓練的主旨在提高人格、豐富生活、第二種訓練的主旨在增進敎學的效率、</p>
<p>（二）各級師範學校的課程編制、都應以學校的實際活動爲中心、例如幼稚師範的課程、應以幼稚園的實際活動爲中心、鄕村師範的課程、應以鄕村小學的實際活動爲中心、</p>
<p>（三）各級師範學校的課程、應當注重培養師範生視敎育爲專業的態度與樂趣、</p>
<p>（四）各級師範學校的課程應由敎育部組織課程標準起草委員會擬訂標準、公佈施行、惟課程標準應富有彈性、留各地方以自由活動的餘地、</p>
<p>（三）對於師範生實習辦法的意見</p>
<p>（一）師範生的實習、至少應注意到下列三方面、敎學實習、（二）管訓實習、（三）行政實習、</p>
<p>（二）師範學校應組織敎生實習委員會、專司指導敎生實習的任務、</p>
<p>（三）師範生實習時間應儘量延長、實習的成績應特别看重、凡師範生實習成績不及格的、不論其學業成績如何、不得給予畢業證書不得充當學校敎師、</p>
<p>（四）對於師範生待遇辦法的意見</p>
<p>師範敎育是國民敎育的導源、師範畢業生負有直接訓練次代國民的重大使命、所以師範學校應採行公費制度、師範生在校應享受免繳學宿費的權利、惟師範生畢業後的服務期限、亦應明白規定、以杜流弊、</p>
<p>上過數端、都是當今師範敎育的重安問題、茲因申報發行全敎特刋、申報記者徵文於余、爰特將個人對於師範敎育的幾個意見簡單地貢獻出來、希望全敎會議與會諸君對於這個關係國本</p>
<p>的師範敎育問題、加以更精詳的討論、</p>

<p>各位同志、在未開會前、兄弟就要上船、等不及開會、所以先向各位說幾句話、與各位告别、此次童子軍總檢閲及大露營、截至今日已舉行閉幕、我們的童子軍已得到很好的成績實在是中國革命成功的最好氣象、同時因爲有了此次總檢閲、革命成功一定很快、所以我們國民政府的委及全體黨員和國民對此次總檢閲、有無窮的希望、因爲你們此次的成績和结果、可以增加黨的力量、可以使黨員和軍人增加勇氣、爲你們的先鋒、去打倒軍閥和帝國主義、同時使軍閥害怕帝國主義發抖、各位的年齡都很輕、有的不過十歲、最大的亦不過廿歲左右、現在已能集合三千餘人、使黨員軍人鼙鼓起勇氣、若至二十歲至三十歲、集合三萬或五萬人、其力量將愈大、而成功亦愈速、各位無槍無砲、何以能使軍閥帝國主義害怕、因爲你們無自私自利的心、没有爲自己而犧牲旁人的心理、所以童軍是國家的寳貝、若、</p>

<p>▲何應欽致全國童軍電</p>
<p>（上略）救國之責、重在靑年、遠道來京、聴受檢閲、精神丕振、足爲全國靑年之楷模、曷深幸欣、應欽轩閻馮造亂、軍閥負嵎、奉命前來漢口、主持討逆軍事、竟不克如期返京、參加大典、至爲悵惘、謹此電伸歉忱、並祝諸君身體健康、努力邁進、</p>
<p>▲中國新旗語之表演</p>
<p>童子軍大檢閲課程表演中之足以値得吾人注意者、似應以「中國新旗語」爲最、第一次爲「中國新旗語」單獨表演、題目由中央戴委員季陶繕就、並彌封署名、結果、爲後五團（浙省貧兒院）第一、第一四八團、（浙江省立鄕村師範）第二、時間爲五分三四秒、字名爲「同志們要團結起來、努力前進」十二字、每字平均爲二七·八三秒、據云、「中國新旗語」爲浙江省立鄕村師範校長劉澡聽發明、並在第五第一四八等團親自實騐、第五團係小學程度、此次據然獲比優勝、一方固爲該團童軍之努力、一方亦足以證明此種「中國新旗語」之淺易近人矣、第二次爲「中國新旗語」與其他各種旗語之比較試騐、依據指導科計劃、原擬將與賽人員分成中學程度與小學程度兩個階段、惜科小學方面、除五團之中國新旗語外、竟無一應者、於是遂混合比賽、比較標準、爲迅速與止確、試題仍由中央戴委員季陶擬定、「童子軍必須以實行三民主義爲任務」十五字、結果、第一四八團第一、時間爲六分五秒、每字平均爲二四·二三秒、文字是　　　　團列第二、時間七分五秒每字平均三一·四○秒、文字全對、以上兩團均用「中國新旗語」作通信工具、第一五五團電報號碼旗語組列第三、時間十二分五二秒、每字平均四九·六秒、文字亦無訛第一一九團南洋英文單旗組、時間雖近四分八秒、每字平均一六·五三秒、而將試題譯做「童子軍實行三民主義纔他的責任」故列第四名、第一二一團收信站將試題誤爲「童子軍應有三民主義及服務社會責任」、第五七團上海廣肇羅馬注音字母組列第六名時間七分一七又四分之五秒、每字平均二九·一八秒收信站誤將試題譯成「童子軍必須與三民主義口（字跡不明）行」不完全之語句當優勝組首先交卷時、中央諸委員、莫不點首稱善、並擬特加奬勵以資提倡云</p>
<p>▲勵志社贈送照片</p>

<p>▲宜渝工潮已各解</p>
<p>▲領江工潮將解决　揚子江睛游、自宜昌重慶一路之領江人員、要求加薪、而經英日各外輪拒絶、並自動停航、以資抵制、雙方各趨極端、而宜渝間之外輪、輟業休班、已達一個月之久、近日重慶航業公會等、以因增薪而釀成長期罷航、不特影響交通、抑且資勞兩方、均蒙重大損失、遂出任調解、勸雙方互相讓步、從速解决、昨日、本埠接得宜昌來電、謂英日各航商、已接爱領江之請求、對加薪成數、業在談判中、故停業在滬之英日各外輪、已議定從二十五日起、命慶和·福和·等船、先行開往復班矣、</p>
<p>▲裝卸工資可酌加　宜昌裝卸工會、因要求加工資一倍、經各船東拒絶、而主張罷工、當時經宜航會出任勸導、以上江外輪罷運、中國船開行之際、應顧全大體、各工人遂照常工作、惟關於增加工資事、由宜航會及裝卸工會、同派代表來滬、與各船東磋商討論、聞連日會議結果、由各輪公司、照原定工資、每件一百五十文者、改爲每件給洋五分、因宜昌洋價爲四千文、照額已增三分之一、此案可望和平解决矣、</p>
<p>▲峨嵋輪暫難開行　招商局上江輪峨嵋號、在滬大修後、原擬乘洋商輪停班時、往行重慶、故加工修竣、及至邇日船已出塢、正謀運貨赴渝、乃刻又接到交通處電告、以有需要、囑令暂緩開行商班、在一二日中、該輪便須開往南京矣、又三北之長安德興二輪茲又接得漢口來電、謂一時尙難放回復航、</p>

<p>窘迫不堪、一方固受帝國主義者金融資本主義之壓迫、而一方亦屬國民徒求奢侈、不事生産之故、自何應欽氏創節約運動、登高一呼、四起響應、良以雖屬消極之運動、而節約之後、金融狀况、投資必多、消費以消極爲用、而達積極之目的、國計民生、多利頼之、而黨員與公務人員、尤應首先以身作則、藉資表率、爰特呈請鈞會、仰祈通令全市黨員、切實注意、并涵市府轉飭公商人員一體遵守、以裕民生等情據此、查節約運動、確係富國裕民、黨員與公務人員、爲民衆之表率、自應以身作則、從事實行、據呈前情、除通令各區黨部切實遵守外、相應函達貴府查照、即希轉飭所屬切實注意爲荷等因、張市長業已通飭所屬公安社會敎育工務公用財政衛生等局、一體查照矣、</p>

<p>▲重光定下月晋京</p>
<p>國聞社云、中日關稅條約、連日盛傳已經日政府正式批准、重光代使有於日内晋京簽字之說其實均係推測推測之詞、昨據日使館辦事處消息、此項中日關稅草約、雖經日樞密院二次審查通過、然按照手續、仍須提回日内閣會議、正式討論通過、并須呈奏日皇批准、方能訓令代	使簽字、現聞日内閣已定本月三十日左右、舉行内閣會議、討論此事、且日代使重光葵、連日在滬籌備慶祝天長節事、頗爲忙碌、二十九日天長節、必須在滬招待中外來賓、并主持會務、日内實無暇分身赴京、故正式簽字之期、至早須在下月初、重光代使、現亦預定下月二日早晚赴京云、</p>

<p>▲廿四天内可到歐洲</p>
<p>▲中歐航界將起激變</p>
<p>▲打倒歐華海程紀錄</p>
<p>近年航業界爭潮之激烈、可爲登峯造極、太平洋日美航商先起其端、繼之則爲紐約航路、各投巨大資本、建造快輪、如能縮短海上行程、便得占營業上之優勢、而中歐一路、自上年大英公司首造一萬六千噸巨輪、將上海至倫敦、由四十五天縮至三十九天後、今天藍烟囱日郵社等、亦各建强率之快輪、以資競爭、而意國輪公司、更在中意班内、特添空前未有之速快郵船兩艘、將來滬行駛、一經開班、即可將中歐航路、縮短至十天以上、此項消息傳布後、滬上歐洲航業界、將起極大之變遷、茲分誌如下、</p>
<p>▲中意輪擴充　意國郵船公司、本名LeoydTriestino、專行中意一線原有郵船四艘·貨船四艘、每一個月中、各開一班、近頃該國最大之輪公司、名CisulichLine者、已加入該公司對於遠東之中國航業、便實施其大規模之擴充、先從載客郵船入手、以期取得中歐航路上之優越的地位、遂决計增加最大客輸兩艘、</p>
<p>▲先添兩巨輪　滬上意郵公司、已接得本國電告、謂現已預備二萬四千噸凈量［之大郵船兩艘、派來中國行駛、一名塞丹尼亞Ｓａｔｕｒｎｉａ一名伏爾克尼亞Ｖｕｅｃａｎｉａ該二船各長六百三十一英尺闊七十九英尺六寸、船高九十一英尺十一英寸、自上至下、共分七層艙位、内有頭等室四百二十間、舉凡喫烟室·跳舞廳·游泳池·玻璃花園·體育房·藏書樓·交際堂·等均全、其設置之優美、船身之巨大、在今日、中歐航路内尙爲超羣邁衆之第一大輪而無其匹也、</p>
<p>▲廿四天到歐　上海至歐洲、（無論英法意德各國）最速快之郵船、至快須三十六七天、尋常船須四十天以上、即該公司現行之愛司葵乃等三郵船、自上海至意國、須四十五天、方有達到、今新加之兩巨輪、因摩托引擎、而每航之發動機、有三萬三千匹馬力、每小時速率超過二十海哩之上、故上海到意國之曲里亞德Ｔｒｉｅｓｅｔ、祇須二十四天、便可到達、比較現行之船、減少二十一天海程、此程速率之郵船、在遠東尙係初見、</p>
<p>▲新輪將來滬　該二輪之船身圖樣等等、均經發到上海、大約在兩個月中、即可來滬、故該公司已奉到總行電命、自六月份起、便命將現行三郵船之客票停止出售、蓋專俟兩新輪來滬之繼續三輪接行快班矣、聞該二輪僅搭旅客郵件、對於物貨、則槪不承裝、</p>

<p>此地雖海外。而詞客文人頗足觀。立有檀榭詩社。乃與諸人周游坡地。此地最多者爲椰子樹。英語Ｃｏｃｏａ又Ｃｏｃｏａｎｕｔ其子曰椰子。遍地皆是。如北方之楊柳。高可六七丈至八九丈。計每年可長一丈或七八尺也。其葉披離四垂。有如垂髮然。其結實如小西瓜。大壳甚堅。須以斧丁丁劈之。此大果之肉甚可食。味如花生。春漿可飲。每果中又有一磅至小有半斤之漿。其果可製油。如吾國内之花生油。可食可用。又可製糖。特吾人不惯食之耳。其漿呆製加里。故南洋人稱椰爲神樹云。但其幹爲草本而非木本。其莖直立聳於中天。此間遍地椰林。爲士女休凉之所。詩味情詞。均於椰林有關矣。余因得詩以紀之。</p>
<p>椰樹高標數丈奇。臨風美髢四紛披。果堪食啖漿堪飲。林下月明細語絲。</p>
<p>於此應當分辦者。爲椰樹與檳榔是也。余久問人。人多含糊答應。嗣乃知其分别點。檳榔挺直而細。小葉。葉在尖頂。椰葉闊且多。幹　而不光滑也。至碁　樹葉排列之美。甚有天然角度。恰如中國之紙扇。亦奇觀矣。又有紅荷花。非花。乃以葉作花者。到處有之。四時不落。乃繡球花之類。</p>

<p>鼠患居家一大恨事。夤夜隳突。攪人淸夢。毁壞衣具。發生鼠疫。罪尤可惡。抑亦可誅。余友陸君。與海上名醫洪煒堂稱莫逆父。日昨來寓淸譚。爲余述洪醫士新近發明一捕鼠妙藥。娓娓動聽。據云渠嘗一席實地試騐。厥功綦偉。確奏奇效。蓋捕鼠能百不失一。謂爲捕鼠妙藥。洵非虚語。爰將其法錄寄鵑翁。俾世之憾鼠患者。知所捕滅而安居焉。</p>
<p>法以「鬧楊花」研末。和「蟹黃」拌成漿液。（按鬧楊花與解黃。凡各地藥材店均有出售。）然後於安息香上。俟乾後。將香插於米碗上。乘夜深人靜之候。燃火點之。衆鼠嗅得香味。靡不蠢擁而至。約歷一小時許。鼠受藥力劇烈之刺激。必疲憊無力。不克支持。頽然崦倒。吾人便可不勞而獲。一一捕之。或以健全之貓食之。必狼吞虎嚥無遺。法至善也。惟當時務須注意之一事。須將室中門户窓牖緊閉。使密不通風。庶幾香氣弗致外溢。方能奏效如神。其法尙稱簡潔。居家者。盍一試之。</p>

<p>歙縣陸良生。商於宣城。豢一犬。出入相隨。已多年矣。某獵人喜其駿快。固請於陸。出八金購之。携歸徽州。每出獵。所獲果倍他犬。三月後。犬忽杳然。獵人疑其逃回。尋訪至陸家。犬果在焉。見獵人至。急遁入内室。匿廚下。呼之不出。一若戀戀故主。不忍舍棄。良生憐之。乃給還原價。而留此犬。夫自徽州至宣城。相隔三百餘里。而能識其故道。仍至原主處。益信黃犬傳書之事。良不誣也。我友宦於宣。歸而相語。因命筆記之。</p>

<p>第十回　赤燄騰天勾欄欽孝女紅毹貼地即席晤名伶</p>
<p>這時顔大人便低低的向文桂枝道。你今天出完了堂唱以後。到我旅館裏來一趟。我還有話給你說。你自己來吧。我不差人再來叫咧。文桂枝聽了他的話兒。出完了堂唱。便到顔大人旅館裏來。本來他們是有相好的。那天便住在那裏。明天早晨。顔大人給了伊五百塊錢。說你行拿了去。天氣漸暖了。把急需的衣服先做起來。倘然不彀。再問我拿就是了。友正這一節工夫。也不到一個月了。往後你喜歡要做什麽衣服。就做什麽衣服。我也過了節後。就要進京去的。有的地方。你也可以預備預備了。原來這一夜天工夫。枕邊衾底。顔大人已决定娶文桂枝。兩人商量妥當的了。不過上海堂子裏的規矩。在半節裏嫁人。有種種的麻煩。因此敷衍過十餘天。待一過了端陽佳節。文桂枝便除去了牌子。實行從良。跟隨了顔大人去了。那姪顔的是一位名士。文桂枝以么二而跳入長三。也是一位美人。名士美人。自然大好姻緣。古人說的。願有情人都成了眷屬。顔大人和文桂枝。也不算是有情人了。可是到了後來。聽說未能克偕白首。文桂枝還是下堂求去。這到底是什麽原由。在起初的數年以内。却也還好。文桂枝有位妹妹。喚做文桂芳。顔大人還做了一個媒人。送與北京一位貴人。到後來文桂枝漸漸覺得住不慣了。又覺得顔大人的脾氣不好弄了。本來公館裏就有公館裏的規矩。尤其是那班做官人家。娼門中人。到那裏受那種拘束便不慣起來了。顔大人是個名士一做了官。更有那種說不出來的脾氣。心中一不自在。便覺得處處不自在了。到那時只有分離之一法。所以從前有位某名士。討了一位名女伶。起初還好。到後來漸漸不得勁了。某名士有個譬喻。雖然是自己解嘲。却也很爲適當。他說大凡名妓名伶。好像是一頭鳴聲很好顔色很好的翠鳥。最好是讓伊自由在林中歌戰飛躍。你要是養在籠中。便伊奄奄無生氣。不過病死罷了。娶名妓名伶做姨太太。也是如此。就好比把一隻翠鳥關在籠中。到那時候。只有兩個法子。一個法子是把伊關死在籠子裏。還有一個法子。開籠放出這翠鳥。讓伊自由翺翔的飛入林中而去。</p>

<p>▲種種驚人成績不一而足</p>
<p>我人設回顧此十年之中。飛霞廠所產各種新車。則無一而不足使社會歡迎者也。職是之故。年來飛霞廠各種車輛。銷數之發展。大有一日千里之槪也。歷年新車。旣有若是之優良成績。則本年所產新車。自必不致有缺點發生可斷言也。自大戰告終以後。飛霞車廠。即五○一號新車。行銷市上。繼五○一而後。則後又有九四馬力之五○九號新車問世。此種新車。舉世人民。殆莫不承認其爲優良之出品也。是</p>
<p>▲車身之漂亮　如以五一四飛霞新車而言。車身之漂亮。得未曾有。軸基之長度。雖與九四馬力之飛霞車。無相軒輊。然車室之内。地位放寬。雖有四人同坐其中。亦安適異常。無擠軋之苦也。馬力之强弱。近來英國及其他各國。對於徵收稅率一事。雖日形加重。然飛霞各種新車。足使車主之經濟也。早已有目共覩。而本年所產新車。其引擎亦頗碩大。計一四三八００。故重量之比率故購車之人。頗爲踴躍。而迄今購有五○九號新車之主人。已不堪數計矣。而今則五一四號新車。又與我人相見面矣。且本年之新車。而舊車又大相懸殊。構造方法。完全不同。自緩衝欄以迄尾燈之處。製造之時。均經一度詳細之研究。俾可所產車輛。足使現代車主之滿意者也。他如原料之優良。價値之低廉。尤其餘事。茲將五一四飛霞新車之優點。解析於后。諒亦爲本刋讀者所樂聞也。</p>
<p>爲一一·一四而實際馬力。最高時可達三十四。每分鐘可轉三·四○○轉也。汽缸四隻。其所鑄模型。長度爲六七四一○二ＣＣＭＭ口徑及行程。汽缸與曲柄箱。均連成一氣。一塊生成。上則配有激動式之頭蓋。而有堅固之釘紐十六枚。曲柄箱有明顯而簡單之軸承凡三。以統馭曲柄棍之動作。而曲柄棍則有軸承四。蓋用以仿馬爾斯Ｍｏｒｓｅ式之無聲鍊條也。此鍊經過發電機之棍棒。俾可節制電力。所有汽塞。一邊均配有適當之小凹子。以作嚮導。抽水器之裝置於汽缸之前部者。有調帶一根。自曲柄棍上之調帶滑車而出。以馭抽水器之動作。而抽水機柄之上。則有鐵製之風扇一架。有風葉凡四。連桿亦彼此相接。連成一氣。活塞以鉛屬製成。有壓縮圈三個。汽缸曲柄箱之上部。亦連成一處。排油器亦以上等鋼質製成。故動作之時。一無窒碍。即將活塞及連桿拆卸之時。亦無意外發生也。以飛霞新車之機件。全部構造方法而言。則主要之軸承。以及凸輪軸承。連桿。鐵鍊等物。因有齒輪式之抽水器。與曲柄箱相銜接。以統馭凸輪軸。壓力頗高。是故全部催滑之靈便。爲任何車輛所不及也。</p>
<p>▲電力之强大　電氣系統。受發電機。蓄電池。以及綫圈等統馭之下。分佈電流。颇爲便利。而發電之力。亦較强大。而上述之分佈器則置於汽缸之頂上。火花塞裝置之法。作傾斜之狀。自動發電之機。裝於引擎之旁。相並而行。左方裝一環形之齒輪。以作阻斷飛輪之用。化油器爲沙歷克司Ｓｏｌｅｘ式。裝於汽塞之旁。自廢汽室以達進氣管。供給混合氣之輪入。此外尙有汽油發射器。俾開車之時。可較爲便利。而化油器之上。亦有普通節弇之裝置。以助空氣流動。新車之裝置。旣有若是其完備。是故汽油之灌入。　盛油箱而以入化油器。完全不致有意外發生也。至於盛油箱之裝置。則可分兩部。互相鍜接於凸緣之上。經過金屬之表板。而表板則有螺釘十二枚。釘於其中。裝卸易如。均有橡皮夾雜其中。以減震力。而盛油箱之裝置。且足增加表板之堅固。在任何環境之下。均無重大之爆力發生。且在發生特别事故之時。欲由引擎之上。設法拆下。亦頗便利。漏斗裝於止火器之下。此外尙有櫌點一種。足爲讀者一告者。即引擎之下。裝有Ｖ字式之凸線。使汽油可分兩道而行。不致爆裂。且化油器之下面。置有一碟。行車之時。如有失火等事發生。在任何環境之下。均可將此碟熄之。是故無論如何。不致有火患發生也。</p>
<p>▲引擎之裝置　引擎與底盤之接合方法。主要之處凡四。其中均有球形之橡皮。裝置其間。以作緩衝。其中在齧合子附近者計有二處。而亦即接合引擎最要之處也。其餘兩處。則在前部。而越過車架者也。單簡之齧合子。裝以　圓形之小柄。動作之時。頗爲乾燥。不必加以注意。齒輪盒以鋁屬製成。分四部加速。且與齧合子裝置之處。亦有螺釘接合。此外種種重要之處亦然。而滿佈綱眼之小齒輪。尢足使行車之時。聲息全無。設以各部分速之速度而言。則爲每小時五十。三十四又四分之三。二十一又四分之三。十二又四分之三哩等。且上山或下山之時。傾斜之度。亦可達三分之一。推進桿之配重。均匀無比。且稱　均　　向接頭。用以挾取齒輪盒中之力量。輪入半浮動之後輪軸中。傾斜之齒輪。比率自五·六至一者。均爲螺旋形。輪軸室之裝置。亦别出必裁。有鋼鐵之壓力器凡二。平向而行。與前面接洽之處。亦爲螺釘。拆卸旣屬便利。而輪帽等即置於其中。</p>
<p>▲半橢圓彈簧　各部所裝彈簧。不拘前後。均爲半橢圓式。至於聯鈎及針。均用Ｔｅｃａｌｅｍｉｔ催滑法。四輪制動器之直徑。頗爲寬長。而制輪鼓亦爲鋁屬製成。脚踏板及握手棒。均可隨心應用。此種制輪。更有驚人之成績。而構造方法。又完全與其他車輛不同。所用小釘。均非常適合。其中有總螺絲一枚。釘於地板之上。而同時又有四翅之釘。繫於每個連桿之末端。以作控制制輪凸柄棍之用。引擎受風扇及熱氣之影響。駕駛於英國　道路之上也。其穩快便利。得未曾有。而脚踏板因長度之適中。不拘左右。均可安置。齒輪之變換。制動之運用。莫不得心應手。頭燈熄減之機紐。置於駕駛系統之前。置有電紐。而開車之時。祇須踏着脚板。種種優點。實不勝枚舉也。</p>
<p>▲外觀之美麗　鋁屬所製之滅熱器。其形高而略狹。亦實足增進車輛之美觀者也。言其式樣。一如蜂房。惟有傾斜之鐵管。裝置其上耳。一一·一四馬力之飛霞新車。其輪基爲八呎四又四分之三吋。輪線四呎。車身之長度。爲六呎六吋。而底盤之長度。則爲十一呎六吋。平圓之車輪、完全以鋼骨製成。而車胎則爲二七乘四·七五也。車身之構造。尤有出人意外等。蓋四門轎車之上。每邊裝有車燈三盞。兩門客車。有大窗兩扇。他如廠車及二人座轎式跑車等。坐位舒適異常。一言以蔽之。一一、一四馬力之新車。外觀之美麗。駕駛之舒適。實爲任何車輛所不及。而實足稱飛霞公司最有價値之六汽缸出品也。</p>
<h3 id="c223">橡皮歷史的片段 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>千百萬用汽車者。能洞悉車胎製造之繁重。與橡樹培植之艱難者實有限。尤以遠隔橡皮產地之人爲甚。最近鄧綠普橡皮公司在馬來半島關地十六方英里。植橡樹二百萬本。預計十年之後。可達每年五千噸橡皮。該公司現今已長成之橡樹約四百萬株。年產橡皮計八千五百噸。</p>
<p>產地挹取橡皮之手續。殊瑣繁。每一橡樹之下。置一盛器。每隔一日。切開樹皮一薄層。以俟橡樹液汁之流滴。一日間每樹滴流之液汁。僅能製乾橡皮半兩耳。</p>
<p>培植橡樹之農民。三分之一爲華人。其餘則係土著。該地之橡皮公司爲此等農民建築廟宇屋舍。設立醫院學校。並以廉價之食米供給之云。</p>
<p>汽車領港</p>
<p>凡輪舶之航行一生疎之航道時。必雇所謂領港人。導引其應行之航線。今汽車界亦有領港產生。可謂無獨有偶矣。</p>
<p>倫敦在交通繁忙時間中。外來之旅客每憾駕駛之困難。因此乃有汽車領港人。此等人可代盡駕之責或僅代指點如何進行之法。每兩小時取費五先令。亦一新生事業也。</p>

<h3 id="c227">汽車的危險程度　喇叭·· <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>吾人每日批閲報紙。路人爲汽車傷斃之紀載。幾目不睱給。且因汽車數量之逐日增加。肇禍之事。乃亦日進無已。但就肇禍之增加。而不於汽車數量與交通之繁多衡之。僅詛　汽車爲危險份子。殊非公平。</p>
<p>據英國汽車學會之统計觀之。當一九二八年英國註册之汽車數爲二百零一萬九千一百六十七輛。是年汽車肇禍數計十一萬一千九百七十六起。其指數爲千分之五十五。再溯及一九一八年。此指數爲千分之八十一。一九一九年爲千分之一百零一。降至最今之前五年中。每年汽車肇禍之指數約百分之五十至五十五。</p>
<p>依此舉之數量而言。即不計汽車數之逐年增加。已可知肇禍事件之有減無增。</p>
<p>更就汽車交通次數之統計觀之。在某地某同一時間中。汽車通過之輛數。一九二九年比較一九二三年增多五倍。然此六年中汽車輛數之增多則僅爲三倍。易言之。在六年前每一汽車每年行駛七千英里者。至去年乃行駛一萬二千英里。即汽車量數不特逐年增多。其行駛之路程亦逐年增多也。以多量之汽車。復加以行駛繁忙。其肇禍之機會。實較數年前爲容易。今據上述之統計。祇見肇禍之指數減少。於此可證明汽車危險程度。幾每年減少矣。</p>

<h3 id="e9">Signing of the London Naval Treaty <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>This London Naval Conference lasted for three months. It went through several dangers of breaking down and cost the representatives of the great powers countless words. Fortunately, this naval agreement of 6,000 words was achieved. Its main provisions are to limit five types of warships, including battleships, submarines, cruisers, and destroyers. The previously publicized tripartite agreement between Britain, the United States, and Japan is included in the entire agreement. The effective period is stipulated to be until the end of 1936. This is a glimpse of the success of the London Naval Conference. The reason why this conference took a sharp turn and suddenly reached an agreement was that Britain and the United States made slight concessions to France and Italy, and Italy and France also temporarily expressed mutual understanding. As for the quality of this success, it is far from what was expected at the beginning of the conference. At the beginning of the London Conference, it was hoped to continue the unfinished work of the Washington and Geneva conferences and further achieve the goal of disarmament. However, disarmament was not achieved, but only limitations were discussed. Within the limitations, there were repeated accommodations, such as the most important third provision, which stipulates that during the effective period, if the signatory countries need to increase tonnage for national security, they may notify them. This shows a glimpse of the painstaking accommodation of the agreement. The US Dun You Sheng said that the degree of naval limitation achieved this time can be said to be the lowest level. The British MacDonald said that the agreement now being drafted is the last step found in a nearly desperate situation. The small results of this conference can also be seen in the words of MacDonald.</p>
<p>However, this limited success is already a pleasant surprise. A few days ago, everyone thought that the conference would break down. Now, it has managed to preserve the face of the conference and return successfully. Isn't it fortunate? However, there may still be problems in the future. One is whether the naval treaty that has been established this time can be passed domestically. If the military and other parties within each country are dissatisfied with the treaty and rise up to oppose it, then there will be further discussions, and the results obtained will still not be reliable. The second is that the military expenditure remaining after the limitation of warship construction, if it is transferred to expand other armaments such as aviation, then the reduction of military expenditure is no different from not reducing it. If it is used to vigorously revitalize industry and commerce, then at this time of financial difficulty and inability to dispose of it, it will inevitably compete for outlets and seize the commercial arena, and there is a risk of breaking down international relations. Some say that no matter what, peace can be guaranteed within the short six-year period stipulated. But no matter how quickly this six-year period passes, how will the economic conflicts of interest between countries be within these six years, how will their mutual suspicion be, and what will happen after all kinds of competitive methods are exhausted? These are things that cannot be predicted today.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Because the Lingbao to Mangguan section of the Longhai Railway needs about 2 million yuan, the Ministry of Railways found that the railway had purchased chain materials under the 40% of the Boxer Indemnity allocated by the ministry and used the remaining funds to purchase ten locomotives, nine passenger cars, and fifty freight cars for the operating section. It was originally planned that the operating section would allocate 150,000 yuan per month to the Baotou-Tongguan section for construction, but due to poor operations, the ministry was requested to allow the newly purchased six locomotives and nine passenger cars to be sold to other railways as collateral. The locomotives and passenger cars have been purchased by the Beijing-Shanghai, Beining, and Jiaoji railways respectively. As for the locomotive currently in Wusong and the three locomotives borrowed from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, they can be retrieved when the Longhai Railway needs them. Now the Ministry of Railways ordered the railway to use the existing funds for purchasing chain sleepers for the engineering section under the 40% of the Boxer Indemnity to purchase four locomotives to supplement the railway.

<p>U.S. Representative Hopes for Continued Work to Ensure Solid Security</p>

<p>Japan Declares That Future Conferences Must Not Hinder Japan's Stance</p>
<p>▲Reuter's, London, 22nd – The original naval agreement consists of 6,000 words, not 16,000, and is divided into five sections. The first section stipulates that signatory countries shall not exercise their right to build and replenish capital ships as stipulated in the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty during the period from 1931 to 1936. However, France and Italy may build supplementary capital ships according to the Washington Naval Treaty, which were started in 1927 and 1929. The U.S., Britain, and Japan agree to scrap the following capital ships: four U.S. ships, five British ships, and one Japanese ship. These capital ships shall be dismantled except for use as absolute targets. Signatory countries agree not to build aircraft carriers of 10,000 tons or less that carry guns of over 6-inch caliber. The second section stipulates that signatory countries shall not build submarines exceeding 2,000 tons displacement or carrying guns of 5.1-inch caliber. However, each country may retain or build up to three submarines not exceeding 2,800 tons. Among these three, France may retain one submarine already launched with a displacement of 2,880 tons. The third section stipulates that the U.S., Britain, and Japan agree not to exceed the following numbers of cruisers, destroyers, and submarines by the end of 1936:</p>
<p>Britain: 146,800 tons</p>
<p>Cruisers with guns above 6-inch caliber: U.S.: 180,000 tons</p>
<p>Japan: 108,400 tons</p>
<p>Britain: 192,000 tons</p>
<p>Cruisers with guns below 6-inch caliber: U.S.: 143,500 tons</p>
<p>Japan: 100,450 tons</p>
<p>Britain: 150,000 tons</p>
<p>Destroyers: U.S.: 150,000 tons</p>
<p>Japan: 105,500 tons</p>
<p>Britain: 52,700 tons</p>
<p>Submarines: U.S.: 52,700 tons</p>
<p>Japan: 52,700 tons</p>
<p>Cruisers carrying guns above 6-inch caliber shall have a maximum of 18 ships for the U.S., 15 for Britain, and 12 for Japan. If any signatory country, during the effective period of this agreement, feels that its national security needs, in terms of warships limited by the third section of this treaty, are changed by the new construction of any country not joining the third section, then the signatory country may notify other countries joining the third section of its intention to increase tonnage, and may be allowed to increase construction. However, other countries joining the third section may also make an equivalent increase in their tonnage. The fourth section stipulates regulations for the humanization of submarines. The fifth section stipulates that the effective period of this agreement shall be until the end of December 1936. If the signatory countries do not establish another more universal disarmament convention to which all countries join in the future, a conference shall be convened in 1935 to draft a new treaty to replace the existing agreement and to fulfill the aims of the existing agreement. This agreement shall come into effect as soon as it is initialed by Britain, the U.S., and Japan. The first, fourth, and fifth sections of this agreement shall come into effect for France and Italy as soon as France and Italy initial it. According to the British Naval Minister, this treaty will save Britain at least 60 to 70 million pounds by 1936.</p>
<p>▲Reuter's, London, 22nd – The plenary session of the naval conference, specifically for signing the five-nation treaty, was held this morning in the Queen Anne drawing room of St. James's Palace, 92 days after King George opened the conference in the House of Lords. The morning sun was bright, and the palace was unusually busy, with arrangements for photography, sound films, and other commemorative events for the closing ceremony, all of which delighted those present. The scene outside the palace was different from that inside, with no attention from the public. Only photographers and detectives were gathered in the palace courtyard. After the attendees were gathered, the meeting was declared open. British Prime Minister MacDonald rose and said that the most convenient name for the conference agreed upon by the chief representatives was "London Naval Conference," and the treaty was named "London Naval Treaty of 1930." MacDonald continued in a resounding voice, saying that this conference was much more advanced than the Washington and Geneva conferences, but it still fell short of their initial goals. However, this is only another process, and the work must continue until the problems that frustrate them can be resolved. During this conference, rumors arose and setbacks occurred frequently, and slight carelessness could lead to a crisis. However, today they are still able to part in a spirit of active goodwill and are determined to use this as a starting point and use various methods to make the five-nation naval treaty a reality. The conference has accomplished great work, and the shipbuilding program, which has repeatedly hindered the resolution and rendered frequent meetings ineffective, has now become a three-nation agreement. They have proven how |when the world is willing| treaties can eliminate the scourge of war. Naval competition has already begun, and countries are again in a critical era, increasing their armaments and decreasing their security. This is a kind of spiritual confusion, and they must continue to work hard to consolidate the nature of peace. This treaty is valid until 1936, and there is the possibility of continued progress at that time. MacDonald then announced that the British government has always been willing to reduce all types of warships in a way that does not cause any loss to the security of any country, and is fortunate to have reached such an agreement with the U.S. and Japan. However, the overall situation in Europe is more difficult to resolve. Before it is resolved, all contracts with limited scope must have a security clause to protect them, as contained in the treaty to be signed today. He hoped that as a result of talks after the adjournment of the conference, an understanding could be reached so that the security clause of this treaty would not need to be implemented. MacDonald then declared in a solemn voice that their feelings have become deeper for those sitting at the same table, and they have become good friends. MacDonald then praised the chairmen of several delegations one by one, and praised the delegations of the autonomous territories and India for maintaining the unity of the country. MacDonald's speech was solemn, solemn, and pleasant, and all who heard it were moved. Then, U.S. Chief Representative Stimson rose to congratulate MacDonald on the success of the conference and thank him for his work in chairing the conference. Stimson continued, saying that now they are signing this treaty, knowing that this treaty establishes the naval relationship between the U.S. and Great Britain on a fair and lasting basis, which is equally beneficial to them. This treaty also establishes the naval relationship between the U.S. and its good neighbor across the Pacific. The U.S. always looks to this great country for the security and progress of the Far East, and from now on, the friendship between the two sides can be continuously developed. The U.S. hopes that all countries can hold regular meetings in the future, believing that this can reduce armaments and consolidate security. After Stimson finished speaking, Australian representative Fenton and Canadian representative Roche spoke in succession. The next speaker was French Chief Representative Briand, who said that this treaty can be said to be the greatest victory in public life, and that France congratulates Britain, the U.S., and Japan on the success of handling their special needs. His congratulations were mixed with regret that a universal treaty had not been completed. However, the French government is willing to show all possible goodwill in order to expand the scope of the respectable three-nation agreement, and the Italian government will definitely express its sympathy. Italian Chief Representative Grandi was unable to attend due to illness, so he was replaced by Ciriani. Ciriani rose and said that he anticipated that one day Italy and its great friendly neighbor would reopen negotiations with the firm determination to conclude an agreement to supplement the three-nation agreement. Japanese representative Wakatsuki said that if this treaty stipulates the overall situation several years later, Japan would feel deeply uneasy about its national security. Fortunately, this treaty is only valid until 1936, so Japan is particularly willing to agree. Wakatsuki also earnestly stated that all provisions of this treaty must not be used to hinder Japan's attitude when holding future conferences. The speeches of the officials ended at 12:35 p.m. The representatives of the five countries then signed their names in alphabetical order with specially prepared gold pens, starting with the U.S., at 12:40 p.m. After the signing, Briand presented the gold pen used to sign the treaty to British Prime Minister MacDonald as a souvenir. Briand and the French delegation were scheduled to depart for Paris at 4 p.m. The U.S. delegation was scheduled to leave London tonight. The Italian delegation was scheduled to return to their country on the morning of the 23rd. Finance Minister Admiral Zaibu was also scheduled to depart on the 23rd, taking the Siberian route back to their country. Wakatsuki plans to take a long trip to Europe, and their return to their country will be in May.</p>

<p>Government Explains It Is Beneficial to Japan</p>
<p>▲According to the World News Agency, the Japanese Privy Council decided to approve the exchange of notes on the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement at the second detailed examination committee on the 17th. The first detailed examination meeting was held on the afternoon of the 12th. Vice-Chairmen Kuratomi and Hiranuma, Chairman Kaneko, and other committee members, as well as Foreign Minister Shidehara and Finance Minister Tawarasan from the government side, first gave a detailed explanation of the reasons for the proposal and the content of the exchange of notes. Then they entered into questioning. The questions from the committee members and the government's replies are as follows: (Question) What is the attitude of various countries regarding the tariff agreement with China? The conclusion of this agreement almost abandons Japan's right to the existing agreed tariff rate and recognizes China's tariff autonomy. This has a significant impact on Japan's trade with China. How does the government view the strong opposition from businessmen in Osaka? (Answer) Various countries have unconditionally recognized it. Due to Japan's extremely delayed relationship, it is appropriate to quickly exchange official documents to make it effective. It is necessary for Sino-Japanese friendship, and it will definitely not have a negative impact on trade. (Question) What is the relationship between the items and tax amounts of tariffs and exports and imports? (Answer) This is because more items are exported from Japan to China, which is beneficial. Then, questions and answers were repeatedly asked on issues such as the abolition of likin and the unification of the north and south of China. Later, the government side withdrew, and the Privy Council side carefully discussed it, and decided to review it item by item on the 17th and adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Measures to Promote the National Phonetic Alphabet <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>▲Proposed by Chiang Kai-shek and others. The Central Standing Committee passed the 88th standing meeting of the Central Committee yesterday (21st), and passed the proposal by Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Tan Yankai, Dai Chuanxian, Ye Chucang, Shao Yuanchong, Liu Luyin, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Renjie, Shao Lizi, Li Yuying, Wu Jingheng, and other twelve committee members to promote the National Phonetic Alphabet. The original proposal is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"In order to revise the name of the phonetic alphabet and change it to phonetic symbols to avoid ambiguity and facilitate promotion, a request for a public resolution is made. There are three priorities for promotion: (1) Resolve to order all levels of party departments to adopt it so that party personnel can use it to enhance the convenience of propagating party doctrines. (2) Resolve to inform the National Government to order all personnel in government agencies to memorize it in order to assist in understanding the pain of illiterate people. (2) Also resolve to order the Ministry of Education to order teachers and students at all levels of educational institutions to learn and cooperate to help facilitate supplementary education for the public. After resolving the above three points, party departments at all levels, government agencies, and educational institutions at all levels should pay attention to this. After compiling a booklet for learning, it will be issued separately and implemented within a limited time. A brief explanation is attached below: (A) Chinese characters have many advantages, and their only shortcoming is the lack of simple phonetic notation, which is inconvenient for children and illiterate people. Therefore, Japan assists Chinese with kana, which has become the best tool for popularization, and its effectiveness is even greater than that of European and American phonetic alphabets. The ancient methods of phonetic notation, such as "read like," "direct sound," and "fanqie," are all constrained by categories and tend to be complicated, making them unsuitable for simple phonetic notation. The simplest phonetic notation is to determine a certain number of consonants and a certain number of vowels, with a total number of no more than dozens, which is very easy to learn. The phonetic alphabet previously issued by the Ministry of Education uses this method, and its phonetic theory is really more complete than kana. However, its function is only to annotate the sound of a character or the sound of a language, which is enough to be a phonetic notation, similar to kana, which is only suitable for phonetic notation and not for creating characters. Calling it an alphabet is not true to its name and only causes ambiguity. The Japanese call it kana, which means that the name is a simple initial character, and "kana" means that it is only a substitute for sound and is not considered a written character, as if to say that this is a symbol for transmitting sound. Therefore, the phonetic alphabet should also be renamed phonetic symbols to reflect the truth (B) Because it is only phonetic and not creating characters, there is no need for too many symbols or too many rules for spelling. For advanced learning and important contracts, the tones of the sounds and the similarities and differences of the meanings are still the responsibility of Chinese characters, and there is no need to add unnecessary distinctions to the phonetic symbols. In this way, only dozens of simple symbols, those who know how to read can recognize them in three days and become teachers, and those who are illiterate can graduate at most in half a month. Moreover, these dozens of symbols can be used to annotate the national pronunciation, to annotate next to the characters, or to be used alone to annotate the language spoken from the mouth. They are suitable for all purposes, and no sound cannot be annotated and no language cannot be transmitted, giving popular education the greatest and fastest effect. If the party department obtains it, it can use the power of writing to propagate doctrines and spread them to the majority of illiterate people. If government officials obtain it, they can receive phonetic documents from illiterate people and post phonetic announcements, and the people's hidden feelings will be greatly understood. If teachers and students in the education sector obtain it, they can use very little time and effort to instruct their mothers, sisters, domestic workers, and workers. If the entire national intelligentsia is mobilized to promote it, according to the example of Japan being able to read popular kana-annotated books and newspapers, which is considered literate, it is not difficult to increase the number of literate people from 20% to 70-80% in a short time. (C) Therefore, the key is that the party department should first require party members, the government should first require officials, and the academic community should first require teachers and college students, which is to first create teachers and set an example. This is the key point that all committee members are asked to pay attention to this time. It is hoped that a solemn resolution will be passed and an order will be issued to show importance. (D) Party members, officials, teachers, and college students are all high-level model figures. They not only have the responsibility of educating illiterate people, but also these shallow and simple symbols can be understood at a glance. The reading method of dozens of symbols only takes half a day's work and will definitely be understood. To recognize each symbol thoroughly and never forget it, you only need to teach people often, and you will naturally be very familiar with it. There is no so-called not using it and easily forgetting it, and there is no so-called not having time to learn. The easiest thing to become familiar with is to teach people often. What is most hoped is that everyone can become a teacher, so that 320 million illiterate compatriots can escape from the fire pit together. The reading method of the phonetic symbols has a very simple method for the intelligentsia, and there is no need for everyone to teach it orally. You only need a small booklet, keep it in your pocket, and the booklet has Chinese characters that explain in detail how to read and how to spell. When teaching people, take it out of your pocket and teach according to it, and you will naturally become familiar with it if you don't remember it. This booklet should be compiled by the Ministry of Education and presented to the party department for promulgation by the government."</p>

<p>The Central Anti-Smoking Committee stipulated that June 3rd of each year has been designated by the National Government as Anti-Smoking Memorial Day. However, there are no clear regulations on the commemorative ceremonies that should be held on this day. The Memorial Day of this year is approaching, and it is urgently necessary to define the methods for uniform compliance. In order to achieve uniformity, the ten articles of the anti-smoking memorial method were drafted by referring to the successful case of the 90th anniversary of Lin Zexu's burning of opium last year, and submitted to the 34th Standing Committee for approval. It has now been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record and is also being consulted to the provincial and municipal governments for compliance. The regulations are recorded as follows: (1) The anti-smoking memorial day should be handled in accordance with the provisions of these regulations every year. (2) All party, government, military, and other organizations, groups, schools, factories, and shops nationwide should fly the national flag and party flag on this day to mark the memorial. (3) The capital shall be convened by the Anti-Smoking Committee to convene representatives from various organizations, groups, and schools to hold a memorial ceremony. (4) Each province, city, and county shall convene representatives from various organizations, groups, and schools by the local government or the anti-smoking agency of the province or city to hold a memorial ceremony. (5) The memorial ceremony shall be as follows: 1. Meeting, 2. Playing music, 3. Singing the party song, 4. Bowing three times to the national flag, the party flag, and the portrait of the Premier, 5. The chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will and the Premier's anti-drug legacy, 6. Bowing to the portrait of the Premier and silently reciting for three minutes, 7. The chairman opens the meeting with political remarks, 8. Reporting on the state of anti-smoking, 9. Speech, 10. Playing music, 11. Dismissal. (6) All schools nationwide should hold lectures on this day to talk about the opium scourge and the efforts that the people should make for anti-smoking (7) All party, government, military, and other organizations, groups, and schools nationwide should conduct expanded anti-smoking propaganda on this day to make the public vigilant. (8) The agency responsible for convening the memorial ceremony may, at its discretion, invite representatives from various agencies and public organizations to prepare in advance. (9) On this day, anti-smoking lectures, anti-smoking exhibitions, anti-smoking recreational performances, and public burning of smoking paraphernalia may be held for observation. (10) These regulations may be amended at any time if there are any matters not covered.</p>

<p>The Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission strives to alleviate the suffering of overseas Chinese. Recently, due to the harsh treatment of overseas Chinese by the governments of their countries of residence, the commission has sent letters to the National Government requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs initiate negotiations in seven cases. The contents of each case are summarized as follows: (1) The Japanese Restriction on Chinese Imports Case: This case was proposed by committee member Lü Weisheng, and the commission sent a letter to the National Government requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs conduct earnest negotiations. After receiving the National Government's explicit order, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately telegraphed the ambassador to Japan to thoroughly negotiate. A telegram reply was received stating that the Japanese authorities cited domestic law as a reason, and a satisfactory result was not obtained. Further forceful negotiations have been initiated with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which replied that it would respond after consulting with the Ministry of Interior, etc. The National Government's Civil Service Department has informed the commission of this. (2) The Case of the New Harsh Example of the French-controlled Grand Australian Land Requiring Chinese Immigrants to Pay Deposits: This was proposed by committee member Chen Anren. After sending a letter to the National Government requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs negotiate, a letter from the National Government's Civil Service Department was received stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had instructed the ambassador to France to negotiate with the French government to abolish the harsh deposit requirement for entry. (3) The Philippine Government's Restriction on Chinese Immigration Case: This case was suggested by the emigration division of the commission's design section. After sending a letter to the National Government requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs negotiate, a letter from the National Government's Civil Service Department was received stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that it had instructed Consul General Li Xukun in the Philippines to earnestly negotiate. (4) The Case of Harsh Treatment of Chinese Immigrants in the Dutch East Indies: This case was suggested by the commission's design section. A letter was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting serious negotiations with the Dutch government. A letter was received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that all inspections and unequal treatment by the immigration and police bureaus of the Dutch East Indies should be negotiated at any time based on the facts and that the embassy in the Netherlands and various consulates have been instructed to comply. (5) The Case of the French Vietnamese Government Forcing Overseas Chinese to Use French Bookkeeping: This case was suggested by the commission's design section.

<h3 id="e56">Another Robbery at Huanglaomen on the Nanxun Railway <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>▲Tracks Destroyed, Train Stopped for One Day</p>
<p>▲Normal Traffic Resumed on the 21st</p>
<p>A communication from Nanchang on the 21st reports that the De'an and Yongxiu areas along the Nanxun Railway are characterized by undulating hills, deep mountains, and dense forests, where communist bandits lurk, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Suppression is difficult, and prevention is even harder. In recent months, the railway has been subjected to three station burnings (Jianchang Station last winter, and Mahuiling and Huanglaomen stations this year) and one attempted train robbery. Yesterday (the 20th) around 10 a.m., news came again that communist bandits had destroyed the road between Huanglaomen and Mahuiling on the Nanxun Railway, and trains were not running. Upon inquiry, it was learned that when the Zhangwai crossing point was calling Jiujiang in the morning to notify them to start the trains, the phone suddenly went dead, indicating that something had happened along the way. For the safety of passengers, the Niuhang station refunded tickets for the 9 a.m. express train and suspended ticket sales for the 1 p.m. passenger train. On one hand, they used the phone to inquire about news from stations in Lehua and Xinqizhou. Subsequently, they received a phone report from De'an stating that Huanglaomen Station (located more than 60 li from Jiujiang, between Mahuiling and Shahe) had been burned by communist bandits on the night of the 19th. Several lengths of tracks were dug up. Starting from the 24th bridge, more than 20 telephone poles were cut down. The patrol team's whereabouts were unknown. The express train from Jiujiang to Nanchang was also suspended. Until this morning (the 21st), the tracks and telegraph poles were repaired, and passenger trains to and from Nanchang resumed normal operation. After the Jianchang station was robbed by bandits last winter, a patrol team was formed, but the defense line was too long, and the troops were too weak to allocate. After the bandit robbery at Mahuiling this year, the 18th Division transferred an engineering battalion to patrol the railway, and the independent 15th Brigade's Tang Yunshan's troops were stationed in northern Jiangxi to assist in the suppression. However, the bandits dispersed when the troops arrived, and it was not easy to eliminate them, so the Huanglaomen station was robbed again. Today, the provincial garrison has sent a team on a train to escort the Nanxun Railway trains along the way.</p>
<h3 id="e57">After the Notification of Russia Regarding the Sino-Russian Conference Was Issued <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>▲Russian Consul in Harbin Expresses Attitude</p>
<p>▲Mo Dehui Determined to Depart as Scheduled</p>
<p>A communication from Harbin on the 16th reports that five days have passed since the notification to Russia regarding the Sino-Russian conference was issued, but the Russian side has not yet replied. However, Mo Dehui's trip to Russia has been decided to proceed as scheduled (May 1st). In addition to the two special committee members, Li Chen and Tu Wei Zeng, dispatched by the central government and Consul Sun Wendou, the others who have been decided on are Cai Yuchen, secretary-general of the Directorate General of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER), Li Shaogeng, director of the CER Board of Directors, Wang Zubei, chief of the CER Board of Directors' General Affairs Department, and more than ten staff members within the Railway Bureau who are proficient in Russian. Yesterday, Mr. Mo solicited everyone's opinions. Unless individuals have special circumstances and do not wish to go, their names will be telegraphed to the central government for approval. All出国 passports and随员行装 are planned to be completed uniformly within the next week. According to outside information, Russian Consul in Harbin, Melnikov, unofficially stated to people that he hopes the Chinese side will send representatives to the Russian conference, but hopes that the scope of negotiations should be slightly expanded, and should not be limited to the Eastern Railway issue, so that future disputes will cause fruitless trips. This afternoon, the Directorate General sent Secretary Wu Zesheng to receive newspaper reporters. According to Mr. Wu, Mr. Mo Dehui plans to go to Russia on May 1st and issued a notification on the 12th. As of today, it has been four days, and the Russian side has not yet replied, but the Russian consul in Harbin verbally stated that the Soviet government has prepared a special train parked in Bolshoy Ussuri Island to welcome Mr. Mo into Russia and plans to have the Chinese Embassy in Moscow转为代表团一行, so Mo's出国 as plenipotentiary is determined to be May 1st, and will not be postponed again. The members of the delegation have now been determined. In addition to Li Chen, section chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tu Weizeng, technician of the Ministry of Railways, and Sun Wendou, consul of Shuangchengpu, several specialized talents have been selected from the CER Board of Directors and the CER Administration Bureau and will be officially announced within a few days. The external rumors that Soviet Consul General Znamensky in Liaoning came to China this time with a major mission regarding the Sino-Russian conference are incorrect. Mr. Znamensky arrived in Harbin on the morning of the 15th, except for personal socializing with Director Mo and Commissioner Zhong Yu, he did not talk about the Sino-Russian conference, because he has not yet taken office, and if he has any opinions, he must also go to Liaoning to contact the diplomatic authorities. Regarding the simultaneous use of Chinese and Russian in various CER agencies, the Chinese directors of the Railway Bureau are all in favor of adding translators in each department, but the Russian side insists on establishing a translation office that only translates Chinese into Russian. The Chinese side believes that this only benefits the Russians, so what benefits are there for us to fight for the simultaneous use of Chinese and Russian? Therefore, this matter will be discussed at a meeting this Friday, and Chinese and Russian personnel will be equally assigned. Issues such as railway electricity rights will be discussed at the same time. The electricity rights issue was brought back to Harbin by Counselor Jin (Rong Gui) from Liaoning this morning with the opinions of the交委会, so this matter is particularly easy to resolve. Mr. Mo will also discuss a result on other matters before 出国. Recently, there have been external rumors that the Russian side will propose setting up a branch of the Board of Directors in Moscow, but so far it has not been proposed. It is expected that it may be an office, modeled after the office set up by the Eastern Railway in Beijing and now in Liaoning, to facilitate future handling of affairs, but it does not have any major significance. The saying of the理事分会 is a misunderstanding of the rumors.</p>

<p>In addition, the regulations on marriage age are also of great research value. Some advocate setting the age for men at twenty and for women at sixteen, but such vague advocacy cannot be considered an appropriate method. I have said that current legislation must not adopt arbitrary methods, but must be resolved scientifically. The actual situation in society should be studied. The existing laws of various countries still inevitably have arbitrary aspects, but they also take into account their current social situation. I remember that the Latin people near the Mediterranean, because they are close to the tropics, develop physically earlier, and the Catholic Church stipulates that the marriage</p>

<p>age should be fourteen for men and twelve for women. In central Europe, such as France and Belgium, people develop a little later, and they stipulate that the marriage age is eighteen for men and sixteen for women. In northern Europe, such as Norway and Sweden, the climate is cold and development is slower, and they stipulate that the marriage age is twenty-one for men and eighteen for women. Although the marriage ages set in these places are based on their local conditions and the relationship between the speed of people's physical development, they are still inevitably arbitrary. I stated earlier that I am raising the issue of marriage today for everyone to discuss. I personally have no absolute opinion. Just speaking of the marriage age, those who advocate late marriage believe that a low marriage age is very harmful to the economy and the race, especially in the economic aspect, because scientists believe that there is no major relationship in the racial aspect. However, the disadvantages of marrying too late are also numerous. For example, a man has fully developed by the age of fifteen, but legally he cannot marry until the age of twenty. What exactly is he like during these five years? We should not deceive ourselves when studying science. Can this man remain chaste until the age of twenty? I am afraid that although he has not formally married anyone, he has in fact already married someone. If he is forced to wait until a certain age to formally marry, he will definitely乱来 in fact. We have also studied this problem and believe that it cannot be solved. Various countries have tried to solve this problem and have written many theories, but they are all empty talk and have not been implemented, which shows that this problem is really not easy to solve. The points I have mentioned above are all what we should study, and it is extremely difficult to study them, because these problems are closely related to customs, habits, social economy, etc. In addition, there are many difficult problems that have been submitted by Dean Hu to the Central Political Conference for resolution, such as how to limit the marriage of relatives, as well as the property issues of husband and wife, the issue of concubines, the issue of the family, and the issues of inheritance, inheritance, and wills. How should these be regulated? These are the legislative principles of the two books of kinship and inheritance. We can only wait for the Political Conference to decide before we draft them accordingly. Some people also say, since the two books of kinship and inheritance are so important because they are related to customs, habits, and social economy, would it be good if we did not draft them temporarily? From the perspective of those of us who are responsible for drafting, there is nothing wrong with resting for a while. However, what is the reason for those who advocate not drafting them temporarily? They believe that the situation in China is changing very quickly, and there is no need to定一个永久的法律. For example, the issue of marriage is just 法子办的. Taking Shanghai and Guangzhou as examples, these types of problems have changed faster in recent years than in various countries. According to the statistics of the Shanghai court, more than fifty out of every hundred cases are divorces. This situation has already gone to the United States with the purpose of marriage being情欲. People in such places have almost no concept of succession and family, and they completely adopt the American concept of marriage. However, people in rural areas still want to maintain the concept of succession. They are墨守旧习 and do not change easily. This is the difference between cities and rural areas. If we take the changes in Shanghai as an example, I am afraid that it will走得快一些 than European countries, while the situation in rural areas will probably not be like Europe even after decades. If we legislate now and take the city as the standard, it will be too far away from the countryside. If we take the countryside as the standard, it will also seem inappropriate in the city, so it is better not to draft it temporarily and let local customs dominate. This view seems to have considerable reason on the surface, but at the same time, we must think about the fact that cases will not not occur just because we do not定法律. Since they occur, it is impossible to solve them all according to habit, and the law should be unified. Although we have not yet定出这个法来, unification is inevitable in fact, because this type of case is related to national policy, and the same case should not be solved differently. For example, when the Supreme Court翻理案件, if it encounters two cases of the same nature, it cannot have two different judgments just because one occurred in a city and one occurred in the countryside. Therefore, if we do not draft, we will always搁在不解决之中 these difficulties, and these problems are all related to principles. It is always more convenient for the Legislative Yuan to draft them, because comparatively speaking, it is of course more appropriate to solve this problem by legislative means than by interpreting the law. In short, of the above two statements, there is reason for advocating not drafting, and there is also reason for advocating drafting. Now we can only wait for the Political Conference to discuss and decide the principles before we follow them. (End)</p>

<p>▲Over a thousand bandits in the Zhejiang-Anhui border area of Guangde and Si'an were severely attacked by the Zhong and Hang Regiments sent by Zhejiang Province near Si'an a few days ago and suffered heavy losses. Now they have fled to the Meixi and Xuxi areas. The Capital Garrison Regiment sent from Wuhu to suppress them arrived at Yanghaoqiao on the 18th and is expected to advance to Dajiepai on the 20th to join forces with the Zhong Regiment and others to encircle and suppress them.</p>
<p>▲The bandits in Fanchang County were encircled and suppressed by Commander Lu Xueshu of the Garrison Regiment. In Xinlinpu Town, more than ten bandit leaders, including Liang Laogong and Gu Laoxiao, were killed or captured alive. The remaining bandits fled in all directions. Now the people of Fanchang are at peace. The Wuhu Self-Defense Regiment, which was sent to assist in the suppression, set out and returned to Wuhu yesterday.</p>

<p>▲This afternoon at 1 p.m., the Wuhu Municipal Government convened a joint meeting of the City Public Security Bureau Chief, County Magistrate, General Chamber of Commerce Chairman, City and County Party Committee members, and Finance Management Office Directors to discuss maintaining the people's livelihood. It was unanimously agreed that the rice reserves in Wuhu were less than 30,000 shi. Once the source of supply becomes scarce, not only will prices continue to rise, but there is also a danger of running out of food. It was decided that the rice gangs would raise funds to purchase 10,000 shi of foreign rice in preparation for famine relief at平价. As for the平糶 method, it was decided to convene rice businesses from Guangchao, Yanning, Longfang, and factories this Thursday to discuss how many shi can be proposed daily from the rice reserves for平糶 use, so as to start糶 on the same day to relieve the poor. It is planned to divide the平糶处 into five locations. The loss of rice prices will be compensated for in the future under the rice donation item.</p>
<p>▲The Wuhu Municipal Government demolished the city wall of Wuhu and built a ring road. Due to funding issues, only a part of the west city was demolished before the project was suspended. It has now been decided to bid for the sale of all the city bricks in sections, with each 10,000 bricks priced at 400 yuan. This price will be used for leveling the ground for the ring road and continuing to demolish the North Gate city tower to facilitate pedestrians.</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, two boatmen, Jiang Laowu and Xiao Zhang, who carried passengers from Wanzhi to Anhui, were robbed by bandits while traveling through Jingshan Lake, 20 li from Wuhu.

<p>Deputy Township Head Falsely Accuses Gambling: Sheng Jin Yu, the deputy township head of Huishan Township in our county, and Li Huanting, the lane chief, have long abused their power and exploited the villagers. Unexpectedly, the other day, they falsely accused Li Renquan, Li Shengshi, and other villagers of gathering to gamble at home and profiting from it, requesting their arrest from the First Branch of the Ninth Branch Bureau of Qianqiao Public Security. The branch sent police to investigate and arrest them, but found no gambling activity in the Li family. They had no choice but to take Li Renquan and Li Shengshi to the bureau for questioning.

He immediately went and arrested Dai and sent him to the Twelfth Branch Bureau of Public Security, which transferred him to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Dai Shoubao's confession was cunning and evasive, denying any involvement in the beating death of Guo Zizhen. Qian Jun verified the confession and sent him to the county government for investigation.</p>

<p>Construction Plan of the Jiangsu Construction Department: Since Sun Hongji, the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, took office, a month has passed. The following is a summary of Sun's recently announced outline of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Plan: (1) Road Construction: The total length of provincial and county roads that have been decided upon is 14,000 li. According to regulations, residents within five li of the roads have the obligation to build the roads. All roads should be straightened, and bridges and culverts are planned to be completed this year. (2) Water Conservancy: It has been found that in the Jiangbei area, various river routes have lost their effectiveness and benefits. It is now planned to hire German water conservancy experts to guide the Huai River plan, diverting three-tenths of the Huai River into the Yangtze River and seven-tenths into the sea. However, due to limited funds, only small-scale repair work can be done first. (3) Provincial Capital Construction: The Provincial Capital Construction Committee has been changed to the Construction Engineering Office. Previously, the bidding for the construction of the main roads of the provincial capital had yielded results. However, asphalt roads can be implemented later because the new main roads are not very firm at the base, and asphalt is prone to cracking, and it is also not commensurate with the overall construction. This item can save 18,000 yuan. As for the drainage ditch problem, the original plan was to use Guanhe River as the tailwater. After review, it was determined that using Guanhe River to discharge sewage would be detrimental to hygiene, and it is still planned to use the original old ditch.</p>
<p>Suzhou Education Community Comes to the Province to Petition: After the Suzhou Municipal Government was cancelled in principle by the Provincial Government meeting, tax revenue has sharply decreased, and various facilities have also been suspended invisibly. The education funds of the city have been in arrears for more than three months. Although the municipal schools have repeatedly urged the municipal government to issue the funds, they have ultimately been told to close down. Now they are about to fall into a state of starvation. The city's Education Association and Principals' Association have appointed representatives Zhang Jianchu, Jiang Xilan, Li Younong, and Gao Jianzhi to come to the province to petition the Provincial Government and the Education Department, and to take the opportunity to visit various primary schools and educational institutions.</p>
<p>Internal Personnel Appointed by the Construction Department: Since Sun Hongji took office as the Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, he has been reluctant to make many changes to the staff of the department, so he has been slow to announce them. It was not until yesterday that he formally appointed them. Except for those who resigned on their own, the list of appointed officials is as follows: Chief Secretary Zhang Zhu (former Secretary-General of the Hangzhou Special Municipal Government), Secretaries Liu Baohe and Xia Chengdong, Chief of the First Section Kang Shizhen, Chief of the Second Section Wu Tongju, Chief of the Third Section Yu Qitai, Chief of the Fourth Section Sun Liang, Chief of the Fifth Section Hua Chengyun.</p>

<p>Bank of China Pursues Debt from Huaiyin and Siyang Counties: Wang Xiaoxiang, the manager of the Bank of China in this area, filed a lawsuit against the governments of Huaiyin and Siyang counties for failing to repay the road loan. The Jiangsu High Court has now instructed the Huai'an County Government to take jurisdiction over the case. Accordingly, the county government yesterday sent a copy of the complaint to the governments of the two counties, instructing their respective finance bureaus to provide written replies. The original text of Wang's complaint is recorded as follows: "For protracted non-repayment, a copy of the printed evidence is submitted, requesting summons for trial and legal judgment, setting a time limit for completion, and bearing litigation costs. In November 1926, Huaiyin and Siyang counties acknowledged the share capital of the Jiangbei Long-Distance Bus Company and borrowed 12,768 yuan from our bank to purchase the second batch of cars for the Jiangbei Road Construction Bureau. The loan was secured by the special automobile tax collected by Huaiyin and Siyang counties, with each county bearing 6,384 yuan. The magistrates of Huaiyin County, Xu Tong, and Siyang County, Luo Lu, prepared loan receipts, which were sent to our bank for verification, with the expectation of full repayment of principal and interest by the end of December 1926. Our bank then allocated the funds accordingly, obtaining receipts. The loan was purely for the purpose of purchasing cars to increase the Jiangbei Long-Distance Bus Company's share capital, and our bank temporarily accommodated the situation with a letter of consent from the Jiangbei Road Construction Bureau and loan receipts from the governments of Huaiyin and Siyang counties. The loan was secured by the special automobile tax collected, and it should have been repaid early both legally and factually. However, the governments of Huaiyin and Siyang counties initially claimed that the funds had not been fully collected, and later used military supplies as an excuse, stating that the funds had been diverted for other purposes. Repeated demands have been ineffective. Now, the governments of Huaiyin and Siyang counties are being sued according to law. However, all special automobile taxes collected by Huaiyin and Siyang counties have been transferred to the Huaiyin and Siyang County Finance Bureaus for collection, and all remaining special automobile taxes are in the two county Finance Bureaus. It has been requested in writing that they be fully responsible and not spend them arbitrarily. Therefore, a copy of the official letter from the Jiangbei Road Construction Bureau and the receipts from Huaiyin and Siyang counties are submitted to be presented in court during the hearing. The noble government is requested to examine the case, summon the county magistrates and finance bureau directors of Huaiyin and Siyang counties to court, and order them to each pay 6,384 yuan and bear the costs of this trial. For all proceedings in this case, Zhong Qi, the bank's permanent legal counsel, is appointed to present the case in court."</p>

He also confessed that they burned down the house of Gu Wenxiang in Gujia Village because their loan request was unsuccessful, and that Lu Tanglin and others also went there. He stated that all the threatening letters were sent by Wang Shigen. Wang Yuanlang claimed to recognize Li and other statements. Yesterday, Deputy Captain Zou arrested the bandits Lu Tingbiao and Yan Jinyi, as well as Lu Chengfu and He Quangen, and brought them to the bureau. Lu Tingbiao and others did not confess. Except for Lu Chengfu and He Quangen, who were released, Li Wenlin and the other four were escorted to the county for interrogation.</p>
<p>Bandit Leader from Taixing Brought Back for Interrogation: Zhang Shaoqing, the bandit leader from Taixing, was reported to the county by the victim Xu Huanglai from Cheng the day before yesterday. After dispatching the police to assist in the capture, he returned to Taixing County. County Magistrate Ming Guo sent detective captain Wang Deming from Taixing to Cheng yesterday to obtain a document and escort the bandit back to Taixing for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Joint Suppression of Bandits by Three Counties: The bandits in the three counties of He, Liu, and Shou have joined forces since the Eighth Army Commander Wei Lihuang sent the Pan Regiment and the Hefei County Magistrate Wang led teams to suppress them. Now, more than 70 large and small groups have united and fled to the Sanjuesi and Yanliumiao areas at the junction of the three counties of He, Liu, and Shou, numbering approximately 3,000 people, with more than 1,000 guns. They are a large force and have demolished the bridges on all sides to hold out against the government troops for a long time. The Pan Regiment has now pursued them to the area and sent a telegram to Hefei County Magistrate Wang and Shou County Magistrate Song, calling for a large-scale joint suppression. County Magistrate Wang flew to the northwest on the 15th to order various regiments and bureaus to assist, and set off from Yuji and Gaoliuji on the morning of the 16th with his own self-defense teams and mortar teams to carry out a joint suppression with the Pan Regiment and County Magistrate Song, and they will surely be annihilated.</p>

<p>County Executive and Supervisory Committee Members Retake Oath: The second session of the Jiaxing County Party Headquarters' Executive and Supervisory Committee members and alternate members had not taken their oath after taking office. The oath ceremony was held in the Zhongshan Hall on the 21st. Jiang Qingyun was sent by the Provincial Party Headquarters to administer the oath.</p>
<p>Residents of Jianqiao Street Request Postponement of Demolition: The Jiaxing County Government's Construction Bureau decided to widen the street and rebuild the road from Jianqiao Street to West County Bridge. Buildings on both sides that obstruct the road line must be demolished by the 20th of this month. The deadline has passed, but due to various obstacles, the demolition has not yet been carried out. It is heard that the authorities have decided to enforce the demolition. More than 100 residents in the area have sent a letter to the Tianxing Liuhong Committee, which has jurisdiction over the area, requesting that the demolition be temporarily postponed to alleviate the people's hardship, as they have no suitable place to move to and are financially unable to relocate. However, the county government has already put this project out to bid and scheduled the start of construction, and cannot hinder the progress due to the relocation problem of the residents. They have been instructed to demolish the buildings in accordance with the regulations as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Joint Jiangsu-Zhejiang Suppression of Eastern Countryside Bandits: The Eastern Countryside bandit Tai Bao A Shu has been rampaging through the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border area, robbing property and kidnapping people, causing harm to the villages. In order to eliminate the bandit scourge, the Jinshan County Government decided to send a large number of more than 400 military police on the early morning of yesterday to join forces with the troops stationed in this county to surround and suppress the Liujia Yankiao Bridge area. A special envoy was sent in advance with a secret letter to Ping Visited County Magistrate Fang and said that the bandits are now scattered in the Liujia Yankiao Bridge area, the six shops of the bridge, and the Wanchun Bridge area. Please be allowed to send troops and police to join in the suppression at the appropriate time in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop. County Magistrate Fang approved the request and consulted with the troops stationed in the city and dispatched a portion of the patrol team, which was loaded onto the Jiufeng Steamer yesterday morning and transported to Xin, followed by the troops stationed there, who were dispatched to Quan Gongting Yaqian and other places one after another to block the area in order to have the opportunity to join in the suppression. It was also learned that Battalion Commander Zhao Xunshi had arrived in Ping from He yesterday and was transferred to XinCang to command the suppression. As of the time of this report, it was only known that the military and bandits had had one encounter, but no further news was available.</p>

<p>Famine Concerns in Shangyu's Grain Supply: Even in the most bountiful years, the entire county's statistics show a shortage of rice for two to three months each year. Last autumn's drought, floods, and insect plagues were frequent, and the winter was followed by months of rain and snow, causing particularly severe damage to the southeastern villages. Since the beginning of spring, cries of mourning have been heard everywhere. Although the Provincial Disaster Relief Association allocated funds for disaster relief and Mr. Qian Junren, a native of the county, raised 4,000 yuan from the Beiping Disaster Relief Association to purchase corn and distribute it to various districts according to a set ratio, the small amount of aid was insufficient, like a drop in the bucket. Moreover, it was limited to extremely poor families, while those in the middle and lower classes who relied on rice for food were seized with great panic. The early rice that has gone to market in Ningbo now starts at 15 yuan and 6 jiao, and the highest quality rice will reach 17 yuan, but even at that price, there is no rice available. Partly, this is because a small number of rice merchants are hoarding and speculating, and partly, it is because neighboring counties have also suffered natural disasters and cannot afford to help themselves. It has been rumored recently that the granaries in the cities and villages will be opened, but this will only benefit farmers of a certain social standing, and the truly poor tenant farmers will receive little benefit. The Grain Consumption Committee, which was originally organized by the county government and enthusiastic local gentry, has not yet received the rice that the common people have been anxiously awaiting. Therefore, in recent days, the sounds of couples quarreling and children crying from hunger have filled the streets and alleys.</p>

<p>▲ Politics and Education Cannot Be Separated</p>
<p>▲ Shortcomings of Dewey's Theory</p>
<p>▲ Strict Educational Advocacy</p>
<p>▲ Attention to Secondary Education System</p>
<p>Chairman and fellow comrades, I very much wanted to come and observe this National Education Conference earlier, but it happened that the central government had important matters to discuss, and I was unable to split myself, so I was unable to participate in the conference and the various group review meetings, which is very regrettable. This National Education Conference is more systematic than previous conferences, and the representatives from various provinces are also more complete. Education bureau chiefs from various provinces, counties, and cities have also participated, all of which are advantages of this conference.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, after years of research and discussion, has formulated this entire plan based on the educational purpose of the Republic of China as determined by the central government. I have only read it once and feel that it is generally very good. You are all education experts and will definitely be able to make better revisions to the original plan.</p>
<p>Your conference wanted me to say a few words, and now I will just report on my recent thoughts. There may be some dogmatic points, please give me your guidance.</p>
<p>The meaning of the two words "education" needs to be broad. Just in terms of nouns, China only had "teaching" in the past. The connection of the two words "education" can be found in Mencius. In essence, humans are always in life, and therefore always in education. The scope is very broad, just as the general understanding of the two words "politics" is that politics is the business of the masses, and governance is the governance of the masses. Humans are always in politics, and the scope is the same.</p>
<p>I often hear people say the phrase "separation of politics and education." The source of this phrase</p>
<p>was determined against religious autocracy. At the time when religious autocracy oppressed politics, politics was too restricted, and the call for the separation of politics and religion arose. It was introduced into China, also saying the separation of politics and religion. This was during the warlord and autocratic period, when it was ravaged and oppressed by force, seeking to separate from politics, and when it was not possible, it was still possible to say. As for now, in principle and in fact, it is not possible to say. Therefore, the two cannot be in the same space, and cannot exclude one and keep the other. Looking at various countries, they all promote the separation of politics and education, but in reality, education is not only not opposed to politics, but is appropriately complementary, and each forms its own independent academic style. This is because what politics and education require is actually the same. Its political purpose in China is nothing more than national independence, universal civil rights, and development of people's livelihood. Education is also nothing more than this.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Education Conference is to determine the direction of education, to wash away the old habits of educational waste and following conventions, and to focus on the implementation of the plan. Not only can politics and education not be separated, but there is also a close relationship everywhere. If politics is separated from education, then politics will not become politics, and if education is separated from politics, then education will not become education. During the period of political tutelage, various construction projects often feel the lack of academic development and the lack of talent training, which is clear evidence that politics cannot be separated from education. The Republic of China was founded without going through a period of political tutelage. Sovereignty rests with the people, but the people have no knowledge. Legislators are bought by others, and the people see it as unrelated. The so-called political tutelage, in literal terms, tutelage is education. The training of the four powers and what is emphasized during the period of political tutelage is also the matter of education. The importance of politics not being separated from education is like this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when it comes to education, education cannot be completed if it is separated from politics.</p>
<p>The so-called ideal new village, Minister Jiang has said that this educational policy must be promoted with political stability and sufficient funding, which also shows that education cannot be separated from politics and stand alone.</p>
<p>In recent years, I feel that there is a major shortcoming in education, that is, the shortcomings of foreigners are often imported to the Chinese people. For example, Dewey comes, and his pragmatic education, the development of child-centered education, spread to China. Students compete for freedom and advocate the abolition of exams, and waves of trends arise, which is very regrettable. China's past education of simplicity and punishment was certainly inappropriate, but since Dewey's theory was imported into China, it has inevitably gone too far. Students are accustomed to romance, and even have slogans such as "Down with teachers who don't ask for leave." Education speculates and deceives young people, caters to their preferences, and uses the overthrow of patriarchal feudalism and capitalism as a talisman for its speculation. As a result, the academic atmosphere has been ruined beyond repair. Therefore, education must be stricter, and whether students should have discipline should be regarded as our reasonable demand, so that young people can deeply understand the necessity of maintaining discipline, that is, maintaining discipline is the obligation of the masses to society.</p>
<p>We should not be afraid of people's attacks on educational policies, such as advocating strict education, which will inevitably be commented on by advocates of liberalism and education like Dewey. However, our observation of Western educational theories, whether it is Dewey or Spencer, is just too much about freedom and too much about anarchism. For the current society and the current established Chinese society, I am afraid it will not work, and we have to oppose it. That is, if we expand and enrich Dewey's child-centered educational theory, then the Minister of Education must listen to the orders of the Director of Education, the Director of Education should listen to the orders of the school principal, and the principal and faculty should listen to the orders of the students. If the students unanimously direct the faculty to break in, the Ministry of Education can break into the Ministry of Education. How can it still be organized?</p>
<p>Most secondary schools in various countries advocate strictness. Graduates of secondary schools have been able to complete their civic personality. University graduates often specialize in one teacher and one profession, and the increase in knowledge is particularly large at this time. It is like the legacy of ancient China's setting up tents to teach. As for our country's university graduates, the relationship between teachers and students is very superficial as soon as they leave school, which is a pity.</p>
<p>We should regard education as a sacred cause. In politics, if we regard education as insignificant, educational funding is not valued, or we hold the view of teaching after becoming rich, thinking that educational expenses can be paid slowly, it is very inappropriate. China has vast land and abundant resources, so the reason why it is not rich is due to the lack of education. If we wait until we are rich before teaching, then the country will perish, so what is the use?</p>
<p>Those engaged in education should also regard education as the most sacred cause, and should be prepared to face all kinds of difficulties, even sacrifices. Before the European War, the salaries of university professors were less than those of a laborer, but educators deeply recognized that education is for education's sake, and the material rewards are far less important than the spiritual rewards. In short, in politics, we should find ways to protect education. In education, we should look at it from the perspective of the educated and bring it into the right track, and then there is hope of success.</p>
<p>China's poor secondary schools are the fatal wound of Chinese education. Is it the failure of the three-three system? At the beginning of the rise of the three-three system, one side thought of raising the level of secondary schools, and one side wanted to connect with universities. The original intention was very good, but in practice, neither side was able to do it. The current vocational subjects in senior high schools are not as good as the previous Class A vocational schools. Most families with children hope that their children can find employment after graduating from secondary school because they cannot afford the cost of university education. High schools, middle schools, and elementary schools should have requirements for connection, but at the same time, they should also consider those who do not connect in the principle of connection, and enrich the curriculum plan of senior high schools. We should pay special attention to this.</p>
<p>The above is just a miscellaneous talk based on my feelings, for your reference, and I hope you will give me your corrections.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Chairman's Response <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Jin Zengcheng replied, saying that Mr. Hu Zhantang has given us instructions with his personal feelings and enthusiasm. I would like to thank Mr. Hu on behalf of the entire body.</p>

<p>▲ Huang Jianzhong reports on the results of the review</p>
<p>Next, Huang Jianzhong, Chairman of the Higher Education Group, reported on the results of the review and stated that the number of people at the meeting of the Higher Education Review Group was 22 for the first time and 16 for the last time. A total of five review meetings were held. As for the review results, they are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Revision of Term and Budget (Page 15 of the Original Plan)</p>
<p>1. Enrich the content of national universities. "Increase funding by 500,000 yuan per year" is changed to "Increase funding by 1 million yuan per year" plus "Subsidize private universities and specialized schools with 300,000 yuan per year."</p>

<p>4. The numbers of sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are changed in order to 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. However, the title of section 4 should be changed to "6. Measures to Increase the Number of Students Sent Abroad" (Pages 7 to 5)</p>
<p>Revision of the introduction: The following three words "this plan is exhausted" are proposed to be revised as follows: "It is proposed to use all efforts within the six-year period of political tutelage to enrich and improve the current content of universities, but to make qualitative improvements and not to expand in quantity. We will also try to increase the number of students sent abroad and prepare to establish specialized schools, and use the remaining resources to allocate funds for academic research in ten years" (Page 1)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Discussion on Higher Education <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>｜Resolution｜</p>
<p>▲ The deadline for funds is reserved according to the review report.</p>
<p>▲ National university professors should be full-time in principle. It is absolutely forbidden for full-time teachers at School A to be concurrently teachers or important staff at School B.</p>
<p>▲ The consolidation of private universities and specialized schools should still be carried out in accordance with the original plan.</p>
<p>▲ Other matters are passed according to the review report.</p>
<p>Zhu Jingnong said that the revision of the programs in this plan can be passed first, and the modification of the time limit and budget can be reserved for discussion after the budget group has reviewed it.</p>
<p>The chairman said, please start discussing the time limit.</p>
<p>Duanmu Kai said that the time limit is related to the funding, so the time limit and funding should be combined into one chapter and reserved, which was seconded by Lu Dianyang, but did not pass due to a minority.</p>
<p>Huang Jianzhong said that there is no need to reserve the time limit, which was seconded by Xie Shuying and Chen Bulei.</p>
<p>Zhu Jingnong said that the reservation of funding and the time limit have been discussed many times and can be voted on immediately. The chairman said that if there is no objection to the time limit, it will be passed.</p>
<p>Ou Yuanhuai said that the revision of the programs can be discussed first, which was seconded by Zhu Jingnong.</p>
<p>The chairman asked, is there any objection? If there is no objection, it will be passed.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Measures to Enrich the Content of National Universities <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhanen said that item C of the fourth point, "Improve teaching effectiveness," should be changed to "National universities should make great efforts to reduce staff and increase teachers, and be full-time in principle. The number of part-time teachers should not exceed one-third of the total number. It is absolutely forbidden for professors at School A to concurrently hold positions as professors or important positions at School B," which was seconded by Li Quanshi.</p>
<p>Xie Shuying said that university professors should focus on research, not on part-time teaching and part-time positions. The current trend of part-time teaching in domestic universities is enough to affect teaching effectiveness.</p>
<p>Zhu Jingnong said that he agrees with part-time teaching and part-time positions within a school, but opposes part-time teaching and part-time positions outside the school.</p>
<p>Shao Feizi said that the part-time teaching and part-time positions of teachers within a school should be strictly restricted. Zhao Naichuan said that professors and staff have the spirit of professors governing the school and should be promoted. Therefore, the four words "strictly restricted" should be changed to "discretionary measures." Wei Tingsheng said that if professors at School A are concurrently appointed as professors or important positions at School B, if it cannot be handled at their discretion, it will be difficult for those who have contributed to academic research, so he agrees to delete the four words.</p>
<p>Huang Jianzhong said that professors should be full-time in principle, and professors who hold part-time positions outside the school should be called lecturers. I think it should be changed to "Teachers in the same school who hold both administrative positions and staff who hold classes should be subject to discretionary restrictions."</p>
<p>Liao Maoru said that he agrees with Liu Zhanen's proposal, but the next paragraph should be changed to "It is absolutely forbidden for professors at School A to concurrently hold positions as professors or important positions at School B."</p>
<p>The chairman put it to a vote, and the proposal of those who supported Liu Zhanen was passed by a majority. Zhu Jingnong said that the next paragraph should be revised to say that it is absolutely forbidden for full-time teachers at School A to concurrently hold positions as teachers or important positions at School B, which was passed by a majority.</p>
<p>▲ Measures to Promote Education in Universities and Specialized Schools</p>
<p>Yu Qingtang proposed to retain the original plan.</p>
<p>Yang Xingfo said that the revision combines the original plan and does not mean to cancel the original plan.</p>
<p>Hu Shi Hua, please ask the chairman to put the revision to a vote.</p>
<p>The chairman put it to a vote, and the majority who supported maintaining the revision passed it.</p>
<p>▲ Measures to Improve the Level of Students in Universities and Specialized Schools and Seek Employment for Graduates</p>
<p>Liu Zhanen proposed that the tenth article of this measure should be added above "All universities in the country should have career guidance," and then followed by the original text, and the career visiting center should be changed to a career guidance center.</p>
<p>Zhao Naichuan said that career guidance is only necessary in secondary schools, and is not necessary in universities.</p>
<p>Huang Jianzhong said that it should be retained. Before the implementation of the examination, this method can still be applied. The chairman put the proposal of Ma Hetian to a vote, but it did not pass due to a minority. The chairman put the proposal of Liu Zhanen to a vote, but it did not pass due to a minority.</p>
<p>▲ Measures to Consolidate Private Universities and Specialized Schools</p>
<p>Wang Maozu proposed that this measure should add "All universities that have already been established should be strictly assessed by the Ministry of Education according to standards. Those that do not meet the standards should be rewritten as high schools, specialized schools, or other schools," which was seconded by Chen Bulei. Dai Qi said that there is no need to add this article, because item A of the crackdown measures already has this measure.</p>
<p>Chen Dezheng said that the proposal of Wang should not only refer to private universities, but should include all universities.</p>
<p>Sun Guiding said that the proposal of Wang has many difficulties.</p>
<p>The chairman put Wang's proposal to a vote, but it did not pass due to a minority.</p>
<p>Liu Zhanen said that if there are only measures to consolidate private universities and specialized schools and not national and provincial universities, it should be treated equally in the field of education, which was seconded by Zhang Mojun.</p>
<p>Hu Shi Hua said that national and provincial universities are directly under the Ministry of Education's jurisdiction and laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The appointment and removal of principals of private universities is not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, so crackdown measures should be formulated.</p>
<p>▲ Measures to Increase the Number of Students Sent Abroad</p>
<p>Shao Feizi said that item D of the second article of the measures to increase the number of students sent abroad should retain the original plan, which was seconded by Huang Jianzhong.</p>
<p>Chen Jianxiu Xiu said that the word "person" in those who have been studying for more than one year should be cancelled to avoid misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Wei Ting supports Shao Feizi's proposal to retain the original plan.</p>
<p>Zhu Jingnong proposed to stop the discussion and put the revision to a vote.</p>
<p>The chairman put the revision to a vote, and 39 votes did not support the revision, so it was not passed, and the original plan was retained.</p>
<p>Wei Que proposed that the education item should be added to item C of the second article of this article, which was seconded by Chen Heqin and Yu Qingtang. There was no objection from the public, and it was put to a vote.</p>
<p>Liao Shicheng said that this plan has been reviewed in detail. In addition to funding, can it be put to a vote immediately?</p>
<p>The chairman immediately put it to a vote, and the majority supported Liao's statement. This case was passed.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Education Funding Group Report <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>｜Review Results｜</p>
<p>(1) Revise various estimates</p>
<p>(2) Determine the source of funds</p>
<p>At 2 p.m. on the 22nd, the Education Funding Group held its second review meeting at the Ministry of Education. The committee members present were Zheng Hongnian, Wei Que, Huang Shiheng, Li Shi, Chen Dezheng, Hu , Zhang Honglie, Xu Shouzhi, Jiang Shaomo, Chen Hexian, Wei Tingsheng, and Wu Heling, a total of twelve people. Zheng Hongnian chaired the meeting and Chen Dezheng recorded it. In addition to revising the budget forms of each group separately, the Education Funding Review Report is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The various education funds are all assumed numbers. For what can be called a budget, the Ministry of Education should be requested to determine the budget standard based on the facts after a certain number of years.</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the estimated number of each item,</p>
<p>(1) The revision of compulsory education funding is as shown in Table A. For the methods of provinces and cities undertaking compulsory education funding, see Item B. (2) The expenditure of adult supplementary education is as shown in Table B. Regarding the allocation of funds, a principle regulation should be set in the source clause. The percentage of the central government and local governments cannot be taken as a definite criterion and is omitted. (3) The funding of teacher training institutions has been included in the compulsory education funding and will not be listed separately. The fifth item of the Method for Establishing Teacher Training Institutions should be deleted, and the sixth item should be changed to the fifth item in Appendix 1. (4) Under the item of primary education, teachers Appendix 2. (5) The estimate of secondary education funding is as shown in Table C. (6) The estimate of higher education funding is as shown in Table D. (7) The estimate of social education funding, in addition to the expenses of establishing social education institutions in provinces, cities, and counties, is as shown in Table E. (8) The overseas Chinese education funding is as originally planned and set in Appendix 3. (9) The primary school and social education funding in Mongolia and Tibet are as set in the original plan, of which the amount borne by the central government should be as shown in Table E. (10) The general estimate table of the entire plan should be re-formulated by the Ministry of Education based on the above items 2 to 10.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the source of education funding,</p>
<p>The source of education funding is determined as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Income used entirely for education funding (1) 50% of the revenue from Shatin official fees goes to the central government, 30% to the provinces, and 20% to the counties and cities (30% for special cities, and the rest goes to the central government) for allocation. (2) 50% of the estate tax goes to the central government, 20% to the provinces, and 30% to the counties and cities (30% for special cities, and the rest goes to the central government) for allocation. (3) The slaughter tax and tooth sticker tax are entirely allocated to the cities and counties. (4) The property of temples and monasteries is allocated to the counties and cities or local organizations according to their origin. (5) The education surcharge on land tax is entirely allocated to the counties and cities. (6) The education surcharge on tobacco and alcohol tax is allocated 50% to the provinces and 50% to the counties and cities. (7) The income of various education surcharges and taxes that originally existed in the local area will be handled as usual, unless otherwise stipulated by laws and regulations. (B) Income partially used for education funding (1) Gengkuan and its investment income. (2) Production taxes (such as tea tax and cocoon tax). (3) Consumption taxes (such as banquet tax and entertainment tax). (4) House tax and shop tax. (5) Business tax (6) The distribution of income tax above a certain percentage will be determined separately. (C) Determination of the principle of central subsidies for education funds (1) The original education funds of provinces, cities, and counties should still be allocated for the original education undertakings. (2) Provinces and cities should allocate 30% of the newly added education tax revenue for compulsory education and adult supplementary education funding, and cities and counties should allocate 80% for compulsory education and adult supplementary education funding. (3) When the education funding for compulsory education and adult supplementary education in counties and cities is insufficient, the provinces should make up the amount. (4) When the education funding for compulsory education and adult supplementary education in provinces is insufficient, the central government should make up the amount. (5) The central government should bear at least 45% of the total amount of compulsory education and adult supplementary education funding. (6) When the central government's portion of the income in the above two categories is insufficient to the prescribed amount, the Ministry of Finance should allocate it from the central government's general income. (7) The compulsory education and adult supplementary education funding allocated by the central government should be allocated by the Ministry of Education in detail according to the needs of each province,</p>
<p>city, and county.</p>
<p>(C) The principle of independence of education funding should be re-determined.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that it is the legacy of the Prime Minister that education funding should be guaranteed its independence. According to the principle of independence of education funding, a special accounting system should be adopted. Once local tax revenue designated for education funding is determined, it cannot be transferred to other uses. Once central tax revenue designated for education funding is determined, it cannot be transferred to other uses. Only in this way can the entire education plan be implemented. Only in this way can the development of China's education cause have hope.</p>

<p>▲ Three Discussion Points</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, the Ministry of Education will convene education administrative authorities from various provinces and municipalities for an administrative talk meeting in the Ministry's conference room. The purpose is to understand the obstacles in the educational administration of various provinces and municipalities, to find ways to avoid them, and to ensure the smooth implementation of the education plan. The main issues for discussion are: (1) Education statistics: some provinces and municipalities have submitted complete reports, some have submitted incomplete reports, and some have not yet submitted reports. What are the obstacles preventing unified and timely reporting? A detailed discussion is required. (2) Implementation of the compulsory education plan: now that the plan has been resolved by the National Education Conference, all provinces and municipalities must implement it within the specified time limit. However, what obstacles are there during implementation? Advantage can be taken of the presence in Beijing of education authorities from various provinces and municipalities for detailed discussion. (3) Promotion of the phonetic alphabet, and other discussions. The meeting will last for half a day. Various departments of the Ministry of Education had pre-prepared proposals but due to limited time, some were effectively cancelled.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Conversation with Yang Zhongming, Representative of the Anhui Education Department <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>▲ Details of Education in Anhui Province</p>
<p>▲ Divided into Seven Major Items</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Zhongming, representative of the Anhui Provincial Education Department, currently the Chief of the Third Section and concurrently the Chief of the Fourth Section of the Department, arrived in Beijing late on the 15th and stayed at the Central Hotel. The reporter had previously visited him and learned that Director Cheng originally intended to attend the education conference in person to earnestly discuss practical educational issues with various educators. However, due to concurrently holding the position of Chairman and being extremely busy, he instructed the representative to attend. He was commissioned by the provincial government to go to Hangzhou to visit the National Games and returned to Anhui through Beijing on the 13th. He came to Beijing from Anhui again on the 14th. Due to delays in the ship, he did not attend the opening ceremony. He also talked in detail about the education situation in Anhui. Therefore, Mr. Yang's conversation is described in detail below in separate sections:</p>
<p>(1) Education Funding</p>
<p>The provincial education funding in Anhui Province was originally allocated from the provincial treasury and local taxes at a rate of 100,000 yuan per month. After the Jiang Gaoqi case occurred in 1921, it was increased from 950,000 to 1,530,000 yuan. However, it was often affected by finance and could not be paid according to the budget. The actual expenditure was still no more than 1,200,000 yuan. In April 1927, the National Revolutionary Army settled Anhui, and the Political Committee decided to use the cigarette tax designated as education funds in 1923 to fully fund education. In July of the same year, the Central Financial Conference decided that cigarette tax revenue should be managed centrally and that land tax should be used as education funds. After strong arguments from the education sector, the provincial government agreed with the Ministry of Finance to allocate 30% of the cigarette tax to education funds on a monthly basis. When the Ministry of Finance changed the cigarette tax collection method in February 1934 to a one-time unified collection at the time of import, and provinces could no longer levy taxes, Anhui's education funds were again shaken. After repeated strong arguments from the entire education sector, and the provincial government commissioned the directors of the Finance and Education Departments to come to Beijing to discuss compensation measures, after several consultations, the Ministry of Finance agreed to allocate 100,000 yuan per month to make up for the shortfall, which was still funded by provincial local taxes. Since Director Cheng took office, various education undertakings have been gradually expanded, and education funding has also been increased from 1,350,000 yuan to 1,700,000 yuan. Together with the provincial university funding of 700,000 yuan, the actual annual expenditure is as high as 2,400,000 yuan, which is not easy to achieve in one year. Most of the education funding in various counties is stretched, with the highest not exceeding 100,000 yuan and the lowest less than 3,000 yuan. Most of the sources come from school land and land tax surcharges. Since former Director Han actively cleaned up and Director Cheng worked hard to increase funding, except for a few counties that have not yet submitted reports, the total amount has increased from more than 540,000 yuan to more than 1.1 million yuan. In addition, in order to promote compulsory education, the Provincial Education Administrative Conference in 1922 resolved to levy six surcharges on farmland, livestock slaughter, tooth certificates, real estate registration, and cigarette and wine excise taxes as special funds for compulsory education. However, many counties have requested reductions, exemptions, or postponement of implementation due to years of famine or military impact.</p>
<p>(2) Higher Education</p>
<p>Anhui University first recruited preparatory classes in the spring of 1928, which was the beginning of the university's establishment. In the autumn of the same year, it enrolled students and opened the Faculties of Arts and Law. In the spring of 1929, it was taken over and reorganized by the provincial government, renamed Anhui Provincial University, and hired Director Cheng to concurrently serve as the president. Various regulations were formulated, books and instruments were purchased, and the Faculty of Science was prepared. During the summer vacation, Director Cheng resigned from his concurrent position as president, and the provincial government hired Mr. Wang Xinggong as the president, increased funding, and officially recruited science students. Last semester, there were 133 faculty and staff members and 401 students. As for studying abroad, Anhui has two types of provincial-funded students and scholarship students. There are 32 places for provincial-funded students, and 70 places for scholarship students. The annual tuition fee for the former varies depending on the country, while the annual allowance for the latter is about half of the tuition fee for provincial-funded students. After Director Cheng took office in the winter of 1928, he reviewed the Anhui provincial examinations for provincial-funded students in Europe and the United States, and found that they had not been held. In recent years, there have been vacancies for many graduates who have returned to China after studying abroad, which urgently need to be filled. Therefore, an overseas student examination was held in July last year, and a total of seven students were selected, all of whom have been sent abroad one after another. Furthermore, in accordance with the regulations for awarding scholarships to self-funded students, about 20 East and West Ocean scholarship students have been reviewed and supplemented. In addition, annual subsidies are provided to 180 outstanding students from Anhui Province who are enrolled in national universities and private prestigious universities registered with the Ministry of Education, with an annual award of 110 yuan per person.</p>
<p>(3) Secondary Education</p>
<p>Since the reorganization of Anhui Provincial Secondary Schools in 1927, there have been six middle schools, one junior high school, four girls' middle schools, two girls' middle schools in preparation, and five secondary vocational schools. After Director Cheng took office, he worked hard to expand them, expanding Wuhu Junior High School into the Seventh Middle School, and the Fifth and Sixth Girls' Middle Schools were also formally established one after another. A Fourth Secondary Vocational School was established in Bengbu, and a Rural Normal School was added in Guichi. According to statistics, there are currently 20 provincial secondary schools with 142 classes. Together with public and private secondary schools, there are 64 schools with 284 classes. All expenses account for 60% of the total education expenses.</p>
<p>(4) Elementary Education</p>
<p>Under the provincial education undertakings, in addition to the experimental primary schools of various middle schools and the primary schools in Anqing City, which were originally provincial-funded and directly under the jurisdiction of the Education Department, the rest are handled by various counties. According to a survey conducted last spring, excluding two counties that did not submit reports, the total number of schools was 3,369 and the number of students was 121,088. Active promotion has been carried out in the past year, and the number should be more than this. Regarding primary school teachers, the qualification of primary school Party Ideology teachers has been tested, and it has been stipulated that primary schools should give priority to hiring normal school graduates. Regarding the investigation of school-age children, in addition to the provincial capital, which has been completed, other counties are actively carrying out the work. Regarding Party Scout education, in addition to investigating the organizational status of various cities and counties and promulgating various regulations, the scout troops of primary schools in the provincial capital have undergone several reviews and performances and have achieved considerable results. In addition, the promotion of kindergarten education, the organization of primary education research associations, and the compilation of statistics on various other education undertakings are all actively underway.</p>
<p>(5) Compulsory Education</p>
<p>This year's work, regarding administrative aspects, the organizational outline of the Compulsory Education Committee of each city and county was formulated, and each city and county was ordered to quickly organize a Compulsory Education Committee. Regarding funding, regulations for the collection, management, and distribution of compulsory education surcharges were formulated to solemnly ensure special funds for compulsory education. Regarding</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Regarding teachers, regulations for the training of compulsory education teachers and temporary regulations for the examination of teachers were formulated to cultivate compulsory education teachers. Regarding research and planning, a book of opinions on the vigorous implementation of compulsory education in Anhui was compiled, methods for researching and investigating school-age children were studied, and an outline of the entire work of the vigorous implementation of compulsory education in Anhui was planned. In addition, the establishment of rural normal schools and the increase in compulsory education funds are all matters related to the implementation of compulsory education this year.</p>
<p>(6) Social Education</p>
<p>The social education institutions run by the province include three popular education centers, located in Anqing, Wuhu, and Bengbu. Among them, the First Popular Education Center is larger in scale, and is divided into five departments: promotion of books, museums, recreational arts, and sports. It also runs municipal movie theaters, children's playgrounds, public reading rooms, and public schools. The provincial library, also located in Anqing, has a large collection of Chinese and Western books. In addition, regarding the social education institutions established in various counties, there are 66 institutions in 36 counties, most of which are difficult to develop due to funding issues. It has now been stipulated that county-level social education institutions that have been operating for two years with excellent results and lack funding may be subsidized by provincial funds as appropriate.</p>
<p>(7) Mass Education</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1928, in order to promote mass education and cultivate teachers for mass schools, former Director Han established the Mass Education Normal Training Institute, ordering each county to send two primary school teachers and people with mass education interests to the institute to study. After Director Cheng took office, he completed the work and revised the organizational outline of the Anhui Provincial Mass Education Committee, ordering each county to organize a mass education committee and actively promote it. It is now found that 44 counties have established mass education committees, and each county has up to 41 mass schools. In addition, this Department and the organs of the provincial capital also run many mass schools to promote them.</p>
<p>In short, Anhui education has been striving to rectify and expand in the past year. In addition to the above, such as convening the Provincial Education Bureau Chiefs' Conference, the Provincial Secondary School Principals' Conference, holding the Education Bureau Chiefs' Examination, the Overseas Student Examination, opening summer schools and summer academic lecture meetings, testing Party Ideology teachers, holding the Provincial Student Speech Contest, the Provincial Games, and continuing to hold the Fourth Central China Games, as well as the Education Research Association for research and the Achievement Exhibition for learning, if this continues unabated, the people of Anhui, who have always been known for lagging behind in education, may have hope of catching up.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Health Education by Jin Baoshan <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>▲ Must emphasize health education</p>
<p>▲ Cultivate teachers for primary and secondary schools</p>
<p>▲ Should establish standardized teaching materials</p>
<p>The other day, at the Fourth General Assembly, during the discussion of the elementary education plan, regarding Article 9 on health education, Jin Baoshan advocated for specialized training to cultivate suitable talent. At that time, both Wei Que and Yu Ziyi supported his proposal. The matter of submitting Jin's written suggestions to the editing section of the assembly for revision, etc., was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Here, we extract Jin's written suggestions as follows:</p>
<p>Health education is a new global movement since the European War. Modern hygienists and educators believe that health and education are mutually beneficial and indispensable. Education is life, and health is the state of life that enables individuals to make the greatest social contribution. During the war, physical examinations of recruits in various countries revealed many physical defects, proving the weakness of using laws to promote health. It became clear that a rich life enabling the greatest social contribution depends entirely on individual habits, attitudes, and appreciation. However, to achieve this goal, education is essential. Health, as one of the most important goals of education, has been generally recognized by educators worldwide. The World Federation of Education Associations established a health education group from its inception. In recent years, both public and private health education institutions in various locations have seen the experimentation, demonstrations, research, and talent development related to health education flourish like bamboo shoots after rain. Any country seeking progress cannot isolate itself from this movement with profound significance for humanity.</p>
<p>Health education in our country is even more necessary than in other countries. The ignorance and superstition of the general public are significant causes of the current poor health situation. Economic poverty, lack of scientific medicine, inconvenient transportation, vast land, and a large population cannot lead to improved health conditions without starting with education. Laws alone are difficult to extend to the entire population. To take a step back, if the public lacks adequate education to feel the need for health and understand its value, then all public health construction will lack a foundation. The largest cause of death in our country is gastrointestinal infectious diseases. In other civilized countries, such diseases have been almost completely eradicated through public health measures. However, in our country, general health construction is not permitted by economic conditions, and the number of scientific physicians is so small that there is no better method than individual education to enable the general public to know how to avoid them. Based on this point alone, it is sufficient to prove the extraordinary importance of health education in our country.</p>
<p>The cultivation of habits, attitudes, and appreciation must begin in childhood, which goes without saying. Therefore, health facilities in schools are a major step in health education. As a result, the Ministry of Education of the National Government has included health as a subject in its recently promulgated curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools. However, teachers and teaching materials remain important issues. Without proper solutions, good health education in primary and secondary schools is impossible. In the past, those responsible for health education in primary and secondary schools generally lacked specialized training. The teaching methods and materials they used mostly emphasized human physiology and anatomy. The meaning and training of health habits, healthcare, and disease prevention were often neglected, failing to meet the trends of modern health education. To achieve fundamental improvement, the cultivation of teachers and the establishment of standardized teaching materials are urgent tasks.</p>
<p>To cultivate teachers for primary and secondary schools, health education should be included as a required course in the curriculum of normal schools, senior high school normal departments, rural normal schools, or normal training institutes. To cultivate teachers for secondary normal schools, health education departments or specialized health education programs should be established in university education colleges and normal colleges. The proposed system table for cultivating health education teachers at all levels is as follows:</p>
<p>Health Education Teacher System Table</p>
<p>Junior High School Health Curriculum</p>
<p>Health Education Department Health Education Curriculum for Senior High School Normal Department</p>
<p>University Graduate School University Education College Normal College Elementary Schools and Kindergartens</p>
<p>Specialized Health Education Program Normal School Health Education Curriculum</p>
<p>Rural Normal School Health Education Curriculum Social studies and natural science courses, as well as various other courses, should all include the meaning of health education.</p>
<p>As a temporary solution to meet current needs, short-term training should be provided for current or prospective primary and secondary school health teachers. Examples include the summer health education workshops organized by the Ministries of Education and Health last summer, and the elementary school teacher health education workshops organized by the city of Beiping this spring. Inviting experts to give lectures and conduct experiments is also quite convenient. If local education authorities can find ways to organize these, their contribution to the future of health education will certainly not be insignificant. Regarding the establishment of standardized teaching materials, attention should be paid to the following key points:</p>
<p>1. The health curriculum for primary schools should focus on developing children's health habits. Only a few examples of physiology and anatomy need to be briefly explained.</p>
<p>2. The health curriculum for junior high schools, in addition to developing health habits, should also cover the general principles of human physiology and anatomy, as well as preventive medicine and social hygiene.</p>
<p>3. The health curriculum for senior high schools must be taught in conjunction with civics, biology, home economics, and physical education.</p>
<p>Detailed standards for health curriculum in primary and secondary schools have been specified in the first and second volumes of the Ministry of Education's Provisional Curriculum Standards for Primary and Secondary Schools (regarding kindergartens and primary schools, see pages 6 to 8 of the first volume in the social studies and natural science course, pages 45 to 47 in the primary school social studies course, and pages 54 to 56 in the primary school natural science course; regarding junior high schools, see pages 103 to 108 of the second volume in the provisional curriculum standards for junior high school physiology and hygiene), which can be consulted. There is no need to repeat them here.</p>
<p>Senior high school normal departments and normal schools are important institutions for cultivating primary and secondary school teachers. Special attention should be paid to the health education course. Its curriculum standards have been drafted in conjunction with Comrade Yuan Dunli and submitted to the Ministry of Education for adoption by the Curriculum Standards Committee (the draft standards are omitted).</p>
<p>The curriculum for specialized health education programs in university education colleges and normal colleges should also be drafted carefully to serve as a blueprint for future implementation. The main points are described below: Required courses: Chinese and English, 6 credits each; biology and physiology, 4 credits each, each with 3 hours of lecture and 3 hours of experiment; personal hygiene, 4 credits; microbiology and nutrition, 4 credits each, each with 3 hours of lecture and 2 hours of experiment; health education, 6 credits; philosophy of education, principles of teaching, educational psychology, and physical education, 4 credits each; internship to be determined, totaling 56 credits. Elective courses: Maternal and child hygiene, 4 credits; mental hygiene and home nursing, 2 credits each; and psychology, sociology, educational administration, educational testing and statistics, principles of physical education, and other courses, for a total of 24 elective credits, totaling 80 credits for graduation.</p>
<p>Health Education Department Curriculum (University students can choose health education as a major or minor subject. This curriculum should be determined based on individual interests.) Only the following three courses are required: 1. Personal Hygiene, 4 credits; 2. Public Health, 2 credits; 3. Health Education, 6 credits. The remaining credits should be selected from other courses in the specialized program.</p>
<p>University Graduate School Curriculum: All subjects related to health education can be studied. The duration is indefinite.</p>
<h3 id="e100">A Few Opinions on Normal Education by Cheng Tianfang <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The main purpose of normal education is to cultivate sound teachers, both morally and academically, through appropriate scientific education and rigorous physical and mental training. Therefore, normal education is the foundation of a country's education. The normal education system should occupy an important position in the entire academic system. Our country's normal education has never had a sound system. Since the implementation of the new academic system, the normal education system has become increasingly fragmented and dysfunctional. In the Seventeenth National Education Conference, the reorganization of the normal education system was one of the central issues of the conference. As a result of the discussions, although the majority supported the principle of "independent normal education" and resolved that "in order to promote compulsory education," independent normal schools or normal training institutes should be established in various provinces to specially train primary school teachers in addition to senior high school normal departments," there was no detailed provision for the entire normal education system and the implementation plan for normal education. Therefore, the normal education problem, which was the focus of attention in the national education community, was not thoroughly resolved. Now, the National Education Conference is meeting again in the capital. Chapter 3 of the entire education plan of this National Education Conference is specifically about the "Plan for Establishing Teacher Training Institutions at All Levels and of All Types." In that draft plan, there are various detailed plans for the goals, duration, level, years, school establishment methods, curriculum outline, internship methods, service and treatment, teacher recruitment methods for primary and secondary schools, and vocational teacher training methods of normal education. One point that deserves our attention the most is that in this plan, normal education (i.e., teacher training institutions at all levels) has been established as an integrated system. The spirit of independent normal education has been very clearly expressed. Now that the National Education Conference has been in session for some time, there should be a more detailed discussion on the issue of normal education. As I am unable to personally attend the grand meeting due to other commitments, I would like to briefly describe my personal opinions on normal education for reference.</p>
<p>(1) Opinions on the Normal Education System</p>
<p>(1) Normal education bears the mission of cultivating teachers at all levels and is the foundation of education at all levels. Therefore, normal education at all levels should form an independent and complete system to avoid a lack of standards and a diverse content. (2) Normal education is a national undertaking and an important tool for building the country through education. The location of schools, the number of teachers cultivated, the policies for rewarding teachers, and the methods for training teachers should all be determined by the government according to the needs of the times and the environment. Therefore, normal schools at all levels should be established by the public sector to avoid each acting on its own and losing the true meaning of normal education. American educator Professor Proi Bagley said that the administration of normal education should be based on the national level, or at least on the provincial level. This is the reason.</p>
<p>(3) In the secondary education stage, the two systems of secondary school normal departments and normal schools can coexist without conflict. However, each province should establish at least one complete normal school. In the future, the establishment of new normal schools in various provinces and counties should also be based on independent operation in order to concentrate training, clarify goals, and easily cultivate normal school students' interest and attitude in viewing education as a profession.</p>
<p>(4) Cultivating rural teachers is a prerequisite for promoting rural education. Therefore, provinces, cities, and counties should widely establish rural normal schools to cultivate rural teachers. The funding should be borne by the counties and cities, but the central and provincial governments should investigate the financial strength of the counties and cities and provide adequate subsidies.</p>
<p>(2) Opinions on the Curriculum of Normal Schools</p>
<p>(1) The curriculum of normal schools at all levels should pay attention to two aspects: general training and professional training. The main purpose of the first type of training is to improve personality and enrich life. The main purpose of the second type of training is to increase teaching efficiency.</p>
<p>(2) The curriculum organization of normal schools at all levels should be centered on the actual activities of the school. For example, the curriculum of kindergarten normal schools should be centered on the actual activities of kindergartens, and the curriculum of rural normal schools should be centered on the actual activities of rural primary schools.</p>
<p>(3) The curriculum of normal schools at all levels should focus on cultivating normal students' attitude and enjoyment of viewing education as a profession.</p>
<p>(4) The curriculum of normal schools at all levels should be formulated by the Ministry of Education organizing a curriculum standards drafting committee, which should promulgate and implement the standards. However, the curriculum standards should be flexible and leave room for local activities.</p>
<p>(3) Opinions on the Internship Methods for Normal School Students</p>
<p>(1) The internship of normal school students should at least pay attention to the following three aspects: teaching internship, discipline management internship, and administrative internship.</p>
<p>(2) Normal schools should organize a teaching internship committee to be responsible for guiding the teaching internship.</p>
<p>(3) The internship time for normal school students should be extended as much as possible, and the internship results should be given special attention. Normal school students who fail the internship should not be given a graduation certificate or be allowed to serve as school teachers, regardless of their academic performance.</p>
<p>(4) Opinions on the Treatment Methods for Normal School Students</p>
<p>Normal education is the source of national education. Normal school graduates bear the important mission of directly training the next generation of citizens. Therefore, normal schools should adopt a public funding system. Normal school students should enjoy the right to be exempted from tuition and accommodation fees while at school. However, the service period after graduation should also be clearly stipulated to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>The above are all important issues of normal education today. Because the Shen Bao is publishing a special issue on the National Education Conference, the Shen Bao reporter asked me for contributions. Therefore, I would like to simply contribute a few of my personal opinions on normal education, hoping that all the participants of the National Education Conference will discuss this issue related to the foundation of the country in more detail.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Anecdotes from the Conference <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>▲ Personal Issues: During yesterday's discussion of the higher education plan, regarding the article on professor class time, those who supported and those who opposed concurrent teaching debated for a long time. Some said that this article was related to the self-interest of the members, so they had to argue for it. As a result, professors were divided into two types: full-time and part-time, to take into account the opinions of all parties.</p>
<p>▲ Hair Statistics: Of the 87 members who attended yesterday, 49 had parted hair or combed it back, 35 had monk heads or flat tops, and 3 were bald, with slightly longer hair around the perimeter to show that they were not slick.</p>
<p>▲ School Photography: During the conference, the members' postures can be divided into several types: some are focused and attentive to the discussion of the proposals, some are leaning on the table and dozing off, some are good at drawing and have drawn several good paintings by the time the conference is over, and some are reading various books and newspapers that they have obtained unexpectedly, with great interest. This is the phenomenon of students in middle school and above during class. Most educators who are old hands at teaching are unconsciously influenced by them and reflect it unintentionally.</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang was originally scheduled to go to Hankou for a review at 8:00 am, but he postponed it by two or three hours because he had to attend the closing ceremony. Around 10:00 am, Chiang arrived by car. After entering the venue, he went to the rest area to rest. Chiang was wearing a military uniform with a smile on his face.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Shi Weihuan Reports <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>It was briefly stated that today's closing ceremony was originally scheduled to be held at 9:00 am. Now, because the number of prizes and souvenirs donated by various parties is about 20,000, it is planned to distribute them separately at the closing ceremony. Now, Chairman Dai and the staff of the Central Committee Office, etc., are discussing the prize distribution method, which will take about 120 minutes to complete. Please wait a moment for all the Boy Scouts and guests, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Number of Prizes <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>

Each Boy Scout and staff member can get four or five or seven or eight items. There are also about one or two hundred types of prizes, totaling more than one thousand items.</p>
<p>Each group can get three or four items.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Chairman Chiang's Speech <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>▲ Save the country and the people with doctrine</p>
<p>▲ Work together to resist foreign aggression</p>
<p>At 10:30, Chiang delivered a speech to the entire audience from the stage because he had to go to Xiaguan to board a ship to Hankou. All the Boy Scouts applauded when they saw Chiang. Chiang nodded with a smile as a greeting and then delivered the following speech:</p>
<p>Comrades, before the meeting, I was about to board the ship. I can't wait for the meeting, so I will say a few words to you and say goodbye. The Boy Scout General Review and Jamboree has been held until today and has come to a close. Our Boy Scouts have achieved very good results, which is really the best sign of the success of the Chinese revolution. At the same time, because of this General Review, the success of the revolution will definitely be faster. Therefore, our National Government's committee members and all party members and citizens have endless hopes for this General Review, because your achievements and results can increase the strength of the party, can increase the courage of party members and soldiers, and be your vanguard to defeat the warlords and imperialism. At the same time, it makes the warlords afraid and imperialism tremble. You are all very young, some are only ten years old, and the oldest is only about twenty years old. Now you can gather more than 3,000 people, which encourages party members and soldiers to be brave. If you are twenty to thirty years old and gather 30,000 or 50,000 people, your strength will be greater and the success will be faster. You have no guns or cannons, so how can you make the warlords and imperialism afraid? Because you have no selfish desires, no desire to sacrifice others for yourself, so Boy Scouts are the treasure of the country. If,</p>
<p>Without Boy Scouts, the country has no foundation and no new life, so you must be the new life of the country and should take on the new cause of the country. From now on, all Boy Scouts should cherish the glory of the Boy Scouts, protect the reputation and discipline of the Boy Scouts, and work together to unite the warlords and fight together, live and die together. If you can do this, as long as there are thirty people in a group, you can defeat the warlords and make them tremble. The reason why China is bullied by foreigners is because we cannot unite. In the past, we were successful in uniting today, but tomorrow we will destroy the group organization due to conflicts of interest. Therefore, foreigners look down on us. In the future, people should unite, love each other, and live and die together. In this way, our 3,000 Boy Scouts can oppress 30,000 rebellious troops. I hope that you will pay attention to the group, protect the reputation of the group, and sacrifice everything in order to be a complete Boy Scout. We know that unity is difficult, and it is even more difficult to live and die together. We should know why we want to live and die together, because the revolution has a doctrine, and the doctrine is to save the country and the people. This doctrine is the Three Principles of the People. If the Three Principles of the People can succeed, foreigners will not dare to bully people. If not, our China will perish. Therefore, I hope that you will work together to consistently implement the Three Principles of the People. If one person in your group is bullied by foreigners, the whole group will unite to support them. Therefore, if you Boy Scouts can sacrifice for the doctrine, then the power of the doctrine will be greater. If the doctrine cannot be implemented, the extinction of the race and the invasion of foreign enemies are all worrying. Therefore, everyone should love each other, like hands and feet, and recognize that only the doctrine can save the country and the people. We should fight for the doctrine, and then the Boy Scouts will have power. At the same time, to make the doctrine show power, we must realize the doctrine. Everyone fights for the doctrine and joins the party. I believe that when 3,000 Boy Scouts join our party and become followers of Sun Yat-sen, Sun Yat-sen in heaven will definitely laugh heartily, because Sun Yat-sen most hopes that Chinese youth can achieve this goal today and can be happy and gratified. Today, I hope that you will not only support our party, but also join our party. Everyone should understand that without a party, we cannot unite. Without a party, the revolution cannot succeed. Therefore, I hope that you will work together to fight for the doctrine and consistently listen to the orders of our party to defeat all the warlords, and then the revolution can succeed. Because I have to go to Hankou immediately, I cannot talk in detail. At the same time, I have a proposal. The age for joining our party must be over sixteen years old. Now I plan to find a special way that, regardless of age, all Boy Scouts can be probationary party members. But after joining the party, you are followers of Sun Yat-sen and cannot be casual. You should fight for the party and win glory for the party. In this way, the revolution can succeed and you can also succeed. I especially hope that girls will also join and fight for the party together, so that China can achieve independence and freedom as soon as possible and abolish unequal treaties. I hope that you will sacrifice for the doctrine and wish you all good health and success. Finished.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Meeting Situation <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>At 11 o'clock, the meeting started with music. Chairman Dai Jitao led the ceremony and sang the Boy Scout song. Then, Chairman Dai delivered the closing speech, followed by Central Committee member Shao Yuancong's instructions, and then speeches by guests, including Zhang Ximan, Zhou Yawei, and Zhang Zhizhong. Finally, Gu Zheng, a representative elected by the Boy Scouts, gave a reply, and Zhang Daofan reported on the award method. After the report, a lottery was held, and Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, gave the awards. It was not completed until the afternoon. Then, everyone cheered, played music, and dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Chairman's Speech <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Dai Chuanxian delivered a speech, saying that the central government's national Boy Scout inspection and jamboree these past few days have shown that the Boy Scout troops have made excellent progress in organization and education during the first inspection. The service members, troop leaders, and individual Boy Scouts, both brothers and sisters, have all shown great spirit. He is very pleased that everyone is gathered here today for the closing ceremony. Since this inspection, the organization has been unified. Now, he will briefly explain his feelings and impressions of this general inspection. During this inspection, we have gained profound experience. At the same time, we have brought together Boy Scouts from various provinces and cities in the north, south, east, and west to unite with each other. The regret is that Boy Scout Commander He Yingqin is currently leading a large army to suppress the rebellion and could not return to the capital, so the swearing-in ceremony for the commander could not be held as scheduled. Also, due to the uncertain weather, there were many difficulties in running the event. Furthermore, due to the incomplete construction of Nanjing, the meeting venues, training grounds, and camping grounds were not fully equipped. However, human effort can overcome nature. He hopes that all comrades will uphold the spirit of fearlessness and resist according to the motto that human determination can conquer nature. Moreover, there are several points we should strive for in the future: (1) The uniforms, flags, badges, etc., of each troop should be uniform and standardized. (2) Discipline must be strict, and etiquette must be solemn. (3) The ability to appreciate music is essential. He will also briefly report on the method of distributing prizes. Regarding the prizes, the designated winners will be reserved for next year's distribution. This year's awards will be determined by drawing lots, without distinction of merit. However, Boy Scouts from faraway places and vocational groups will receive a little more from the organizing committee as encouragement. There will also be special prizes for young children and Girl Scouts. In general, each troop will receive seven items in total, and each person will receive five items.</p>

<p>▲ He Yingqin's Telegram to Boy Scouts Nationwide</p>
<p>(Above excerpt) The responsibility of saving the country lies heavily on the youth. Coming from afar to the capital to receive inspection, their spirits are uplifted, which serves as a model for the nation's youth. I am deeply fortunate and pleased. Yingqin and Yan and Feng are creating chaos, and the warlords are putting up a stubborn resistance. I have been ordered to come to Hankou to oversee the military operations of suppressing the rebellion, so I cannot return to the capital as scheduled to attend the grand ceremony, which I deeply regret. I hereby extend my apologies via telegram and wish you all good health and continued progress.</p>
<p>▲ Performance of China's New Flag Semaphore</p>
<p>Among the curriculum demonstrations of the Boy Scout Grand Inspection, the one most worthy of our attention seems to be "China's New Flag Semaphore." This was the first time "China's New Flag Semaphore" was performed independently. The topic was written and sealed by Central Committee member Dai Jitao, and the winners were the 5th Troop (Zhejiang Poor Children's Home) in first place and the 148th Troop (Zhejiang Provincial Rural Normal School) in second place. The time was 5 minutes and 34 seconds, and the phrase was "Comrades, unite and strive forward," a total of twelve characters. Each character took an average of 27.83 seconds. It is said that "China's New Flag Semaphore" was invented by Liu Zaoting, the principal of Zhejiang Provincial Rural Normal School, and personally tested in the 5th and 148th Troops. The 5th Troop is at the elementary school level, and the fact that it won the competition proves that this "China's New Flag Semaphore" is easy to understand. The second performance was a comparative experiment of "China's New Flag Semaphore" and other flag semaphores. According to the Guidance Department's plan, the participants were originally divided into two levels: middle school and elementary school. Unfortunately, apart from the 5th Troop's China New Flag Semaphore, there were no other participants from the elementary school level. Therefore, the competition was mixed, and the comparison standards were speed and accuracy. The test question was still set by Central Committee member Dai Jitao: "Boy Scouts must take the implementation of the Three Principles of the People as their mission," a total of fifteen characters. The result was that the 148th Troop came in first, with a time of 6 minutes and 5 seconds, averaging 24.23 seconds per character. The Troop came in second, with a time of 7 minutes and 5 seconds, averaging 31.40 seconds per character. Both of the above groups used "China's New Flag Semaphore" as their communication tool. The 155th Troop's telegraph code flag group ranked third, with a time of 12 minutes and 52 seconds, averaging 49.6 seconds per character, and the text was also correct. The 119th Troop's Nanyang English single flag group, although the time was close to 4 minutes and 8 seconds, averaging 16.53 seconds per character, translated the test question as "Boy Scouts implement the Three Principles of the People as his responsibility," so they ranked fourth. The 121st Troop's receiving station mistook the test question for "Boy Scouts should have the Three Principles of the People and the responsibility to serve the community." The 57th Troop's Shanghai Guangzhao Roman Phonetic Alphabet group ranked sixth with a time of 7 minutes, 17 and 4/5 seconds, averaging 29.18 seconds per character. The receiving station mistakenly translated the test question into "Boy Scouts must and the Three Principles of the People (illegible characters) line," an incomplete sentence. When the winning groups handed in their papers first, the central committee members nodded and praised them, and planned to add special rewards to promote them.</p>
<p>▲ Photo Presented by the Lishi Society</p>
<p>At the closing ceremony of the Boy Scouts, the Lishi Society printed a photo of President Chiang Kai-shek, with a small portrait of Chiang and the Lishi Society creed on the front, and a welcome message to all Boy Scouts on the back, which was distributed to all Boy Scout troops as a souvenir.</p>

<p>The fourteen troops of the China Boy Scouts of the Shanghai Special Municipality who went to the capital to participate in the general inspection, having completed their duties and participated in yesterday's closing ceremony, set off for Shanghai. Except for Guanggong and others who will continue to tour the scenic spots, and the special commissioner of the Municipal Training Department who had returned to Shanghai in advance due to business, the rest all took the night train from the capital last night and will arrive in Shanghai this morning. It is said that in this inspection and performance, all the Shanghai troops won praise.</p>

<p>Since Liaoning returned to the central government, the provincial government has been determined to innovate in political construction. Commander Zhang Xueliang has paid more attention to education, and last autumn, he generously donated five million yuan to the primary and secondary school education foundation, and invited celebrities Yuan Jinkai, Wang Shuhan, and Liu Shangqing to be directors, in order to use the interest to run education and training schools. He also donated 200,000 yuan to open various Xinmin primary schools as a model for improving primary schools throughout the province. Recently, the provincial government subsidized the athletes participating in the National Games in Hangzhou with 20,000 yuan, and distributed 40,000 yuan to various school visiting groups, such as the 13-member visiting group of principals of provincial schools, led by Lin Yaoshan; the 34-member visiting group of Xinmin school principals, led by Jin Desen; the 55-member visiting group of primary school education research classes, guided by Lu Rixuan; the 18-member travel group of the Provincial Women's Normal School, led by Cai Weiqian; the 50-member visiting group of the Provincial No. 1 Normal School, led by Zhang Jinghan; the 40-member inspection group of the Provincial No. 3 Middle School, led by Yang Chunfeng; the 50-member visiting group of the Provincial No. 2 Normal School, led by Li Yinqing; the 20-member Tonghua education visiting group, led by Gao Pingu; the 20-member group personally led by Feng Yong; and the 14-member Harbin education inspection group, led by Li Yousheng. They have all gone south to Jiangsu and Zhejiang to inspect the work of education, politics, and the party, in order to learn from them. The president of the Education Association was specially hired as the general instructor, and Su Shangda and Qian Nianyao, two gentlemen from the Liaoning Chamber of Commerce, sent telegrams to Huang Jing in Shanghai to take care of everything.</p>

<p>Since the Training Directorate of the National Government sent Cao Wenlin as a military instructor to Shanghai Middle School last autumn, the military training of students has been reorganized, and the results have been remarkable in the past year. In addition to academic training in the school, an outdoor exercise was held in Longhua in the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 21st), and the onlookers along the way were like a wall. Some mistakenly thought it was a formal army. Cheng Tongwen, the inspection officer sent by the Training Directorate to inspect the military education of high schools and above in Jiangsu Province, came to the school for inspection. Officer Cheng commented that this was the most satisfactory inspection he had seen since he started.</p>

<h3 id="e128">The Case of Resisting Chinese Directors <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>▲ Continued Efforts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association released the following information yesterday:</p>
<p>▲ Five Chinese Directors Question the Municipal Council The five newly appointed Chinese directors of the Municipal Council, Yuan Ludeng and others, recently sent a letter to Edward, the General Manager of the Municipal Council, stating: "Dear Sir, We, the undersigned, have been elected by the Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association as directors to attend the Public Concession Municipal Council for this term, as notified by the association on April 16. With regard to the first board meeting on April 17, we did not receive any prior notice, and therefore could not attend. We hereby formally protest and reserve all rights to take appropriate action when necessary. We request your kind attention to this matter. Sincerely, Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Bei Songsheng, Liu Hongsheng, April 19."</p>
<p>▲ Discussing the Basis for Increasing Chinese Directors Guowen News Agency reported: Yesterday, a well-known foreign legal expert in Shanghai talked about the declaration issued by the Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association on April 18. It is not a fabrication. Although the declaration is based on principles, foreigners may think it is insignificant and think that they can refuse to recognize it or be bound by it. However, in reality, foreigners are bound by a kind of written law, namely, the Shanghai Foreign Settlement Regulations, also known as the Yangjingbang Regulations. Article 28 of the regulations states: "If it is necessary to modify or supplement these regulations in the future, and there are doubtful points in the various measures and powers stipulated in the regulations, the consuls of various countries and the local Chinese officials shall consult and revise them, and they shall be implemented only after they have been approved by the diplomatic corps and the Chinese government." Therefore, the addition or increase of Chinese directors to the Municipal Council is a "supplement" to the Settlement Regulations, which has been "consulted and approved by the consuls of various countries and the local Chinese officials and approved by the diplomatic corps and the Chinese government." Therefore, the Ratepayers Association has no right to discuss and resolve it.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Party Department Resolves on Five Measures The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee sent a letter to the Ratepayers Association yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, The fact that the Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession of Shanghai has rejected the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors this time is an infringement on sovereignty, and we share the same deep indignation. The following five measures have been resolved by this committee to deal with this situation: (1) Request the central government to order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to actively recover the Shanghai Concession. (2) Before this committee has a proper solution, (2) The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Concession should elect eleven additional directors to the municipal organs of the Concession and form its own board of directors to handle board affairs. (2) The taxes paid by the citizens of the Concession should be deposited uniformly in a bank designated by the Chinese Ratepayers Association from this month onwards and should no longer be remitted to the Municipal Council. (3) All properties owned by Chinese in the Concession that have obtained deed certificates by borrowing the names of foreign merchants should be cancelled and registered under the names of foreign merchants, and should be changed to the land administrative organs of our country.</p>
<p>(4) The Municipal Council should apologize to the Chinese directors for the rude and illegal actions of the Ratepayers Association. (5) Issue a declaration stating that the number of Chinese directors does not need to be approved by a special meeting of foreign taxpayers. Therefore, the claim that a special meeting of foreign taxpayers should be convened to seek remedies is not acceptable. In addition to the fact that (1) and (5) have already been handled, the remaining items (2, 3, and 4) should be investigated and handled by your association.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram from the Special Party Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways The Executive Committee of the Special Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways sent a telegram to the Ratepayers Association, stating: "It has been reported that the Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers in the Public Concession has rejected the issue of increasing the number of Chinese directors. We are deeply outraged. Shanghai is our Chinese territory, but due to the constraints of unequal treaties, our people have suffered endless humiliation. This rejection of the increase in Chinese directors is tantamount to gagging people and arbitrarily making decisions beyond one's authority, with the absurd intention of permanently occupying the Concession and not returning. If we continue to be complacent and do not strive for it, then there will never be room for Chinese people to speak in the Shanghai Concession, and there will never be hope of recovering the Concession. In addition to the fact that this committee has requested the central government to instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make a serious protest, we hereby request your association to rise up together, argue on the basis of reason, and strive to achieve legitimate goals, consolidate our national rights, and suppress the atrocities of imperialism, as a prelude to the recovery of rights. This committee respectfully leads the comrades of the two railways and pledges to be the rearguard. We are filled with urgency."</p>
<p>▲ Letter from the Yewenyi Road Business Federation The Yewenyi Road Ninth Road Business Federation sent a letter to the Ratepayers Association yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, The Ratepayers Association of Foreign Taxpayers has exceeded its authority to discuss and reject the case of increasing the two Chinese directors of the Municipal Council. The merchants and citizens of our road are outraged by this. This matter concerns the rights of citizens. We hope that your association will continue its fearless spirit and strive to achieve its goals. The representatives of our association and the entire business community of this road are willing to be the rearguard and pledge to fight to the death with imperialism in order to avenge our humiliation and seek the realization of freedom and equality. We hereby send this letter for your information."</p>
<p>▲ The Ratepayers Association Replied to Four Organizations The Ratepayers Association replied to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, the Shanghai County Party Department, the Special Party Department of the Two Railways, and the Yewenyi Road Ninth Road Business Federation yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, The fact that the Shanghai Public Concession Foreign Taxpayers Association has exceeded its authority to reject the increase of two Chinese directors is a matter of deep indignation for all Chinese people. This association has formally issued declarations on the 17th and 18th of this month to express our views, and we deeply recognize that the rights that citizens should have cannot be firmly guaranteed unless the Concession is recovered. As for increasing the number of Chinese directors, it is only a compromise and a transitional measure before the Concession is recovered. On the one hand, it is a diplomatic issue, and on the other hand, it depends on the unanimous support of the people to achieve success. We are grateful for your association's expression of support and encouragement to strive for success. In the future, in addition to waiting for negotiations with the diplomatic authorities, we are also prepared to take legal and final measures when necessary to achieve our goals. We hereby send this reply and await your instructions."</p>
<p>▲ Declaration by the National Goods Maintenance Association The China National Goods Maintenance Association issued a declaration on the issue of the Western Directors of the Municipal Council, stating: "Fellow compatriots from all walks of life, please be advised that the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors of the Public Concession Municipal Council has recently been rejected by the Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers, and there have been speeches insulting all Chinese people. After reading this, we are shocked and indignant. We believe that Shanghai is our Chinese territory, and although it has been designated as a Concession due to temporary circumstances, the sovereignty lies with China, which is an indisputable principle. Moreover, Chinese residents still constitute the majority of the population in Shanghai, and the amount of taxes paid is also mostly paid by Chinese. According to the proportion of taxes paid, Chinese directors should also constitute the majority in order to be fair. Now, the Westerners living in Shanghai in the Public Concession regard themselves as the masters and act perversely to this extent. Moreover, the insulting remarks about the Chinese people in the reported speech are close to inciting hostility between China and foreign countries and destroying the spirit of cooperation, which is intolerable. We, the Chinese people who love peace, sincerely hope to work together with the municipal organs that have emerged from cooperation to engage in construction and achieve the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity. Therefore, we citizens recognize that Chinese directors can represent the public opinion of our citizens and implement the spirit of cooperation between China and foreign countries. Now, the Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers has been moved by the erroneous and arrogant remarks of Mr. Mack to reject this minimum participation in municipal power. Who has given this kind of power and on what legal basis is it based? Moreover, the directors who manage municipal affairs have the same powers and status. Why is there so much emphasis on them and so little on us? Moreover, we have never heard of the election of Western directors being approved by the Chinese Taxpayers Association. Why should Chinese directors be approved by the Western Taxpayers Association? This is unfair. We, the Chinese people in the National Goods industry in Shanghai, solemnly declare that we do not recognize that foreigners have this power. All of us Chinese people are willing to fully cooperate with legitimate municipal organs and fulfill our tax obligations according to law.

<h3 id="e129">Public Works Bureau Calls Special Meeting <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>▲Yesterday a notice was issued.</p>
<p>▲Mr. Fessenden's Opinion</p>
<p>Sixty-one foreigners in this city jointly petitioned the senior consul on the 20th of this month to authorize the Public Works Bureau to convene a special meeting of Western ratepayers in the Public Concession at 5:30 PM on May 2nd to consider and pass the following motion proposed by Mr. Marshall and seconded by Mr. Baker: "Authorize and order the Public Works Bureau to propose to the countries concerned that the number of Chinese directors on the Public Works Bureau be increased from three to five."

After unanimous agreement, he notified the Public Works Bureau, which issued a notice yesterday convening the special meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, expressed his opinion yesterday regarding the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors on the Public Works Bureau, which will be considered at a special meeting of Western ratepayers. He said, "I believe this proposal will be enthusiastically supported by those present. To my knowledge, none of the directors of the Public Works Bureau do not welcome this proposal, so I expect public opinion will also support it. The passage of this proposal is very certain."</p>
<h3 id="e130">Upriver Foreign Vessels Resume Service After More Than a Month's Strike <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>▲Labor disputes in Yichang and Chongqing have been resolved.</p>
<p>▲Labor dispute in upstream area to be resolved. Since the employees on the upstream of Yangtze River, from Yichang to Chongqing, requested a pay raise and were rejected by British and Japanese foreign vessels, the vessels automatically suspended service to resist. Both sides went to extremes, and the foreign vessels between Yichang and Chongqing had been suspended for a month. Recently, the Chongqing Shipping Association, etc., pointed out that the long-term strike caused by the pay raise would not only affect transportation, but also cause significant losses to both labor and capital. Therefore, they acted as mediators to persuade both sides to compromise and resolve the issue as soon as possible. Yesterday, this city received a telegram from Yichang stating that British and Japanese shipping companies have accepted the request from upstream workers, and the amount of the pay raise is under negotiation. Therefore, the British and Japanese foreign vessels that suspended business in Shanghai have decided to order the Qinghe, Fuhe, and other ships to set sail for resumption of service starting from the 25th.</p>
<p>▲Loading and unloading wages may be appropriately increased. The Yichang Stevedores' Union requested a doubling of wages, which was rejected by the shipowners, leading to a strike. At that time, the Yichang Shipping Association intervened and advised that when the upstream foreign vessels were suspended and Chinese ships were operating, the overall situation should be taken into consideration. The workers then continued to work as usual. However, regarding the wage increase, the Yichang Shipping Association and the Stevedores' Union jointly sent representatives to Shanghai to discuss with the shipowners. It is reported that after several days of meetings, the shipping companies have agreed to change the original wage of 150 cash per piece to 5 cents per piece. Since the exchange rate in Yichang is 4,000 cash per silver dollar, this is an increase of one-third. A peaceful resolution of this issue is expected.</p>
<p>▲The Emei Wheel is temporarily difficult to operate. After major repairs in Shanghai, the China Merchants Bureau's upstream vessel Emei was originally scheduled to go to Chongqing when foreign merchant ships suspended service. Therefore, the repairs were completed, and it was planning to transport goods to Chongqing. However, it recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Communications stating that it was needed and instructed to postpone the opening of commercial routes. In a day or two, the ship will have to sail to Nanjing. In addition, the Chang'an and Dexing vessels of Sanbei received telegrams from Hankou stating that it would be difficult to resume service for a while.</p>
<p>▲Ning Shao New Wheel Plans to Rent. The Norwegian wheel purchased by Ning Shao Company for 14,000 pounds was originally intended to expand the Yangtze River shipping industry. Now the wheel has been renamed Ning Jing. Yesterday, it was reported to the Jianghai Customs to change the Chinese flag. Recently, due to the shortage of commercial goods on the Yangtze River, the company has decided not to send the ship to the Shanghai-Hankou route for the time being. It is planning to rent it out first, switch to sea routes, and then take it back for its own use after the situation is slightly calmer, and join the Yangtze River route.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Continued News of Rice Price Stabilization Committee <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>▲Starting from May 1st</p>
<p>The Municipal Rice Price Stabilization Committee was established on the 16th of this month. Recently, it has been working tirelessly. Chairman Pan is supervising the procurement and public sales of affordable rice day and night, and the committee members are responsible for planning and implementing the work. It is also reported that the committee is scheduled to start handling affordable rice on May 1st. Yesterday, the first batch of more than 500 bags of foreign rice was obtained.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Business Reorganization Committee Raises Funds for Rice Price Stabilization Losses <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Business Reorganization Committee believes that the rice price in this city has soared, reaching more than 21 yuan per stone. As the period between the harvest seasons is approaching, the hidden dangers are worrisome if precautions are not taken early. Previously, the Municipal Food Committee decided to purchase 200,000 bags of foreign rice in succession to handle affordable rice. However, the funds for the losses have not been settled. Now the Social Affairs Bureau plans to raise 100,000 to 150,000 yuan to compensate. In addition to the allocations from various groups, municipal governments, silver industry, and rice industry, there is still a shortage of 30,000 yuan. It is reported that the Business Reorganization Committee has sent letters to its affiliated industry groups yesterday, setting a joint meeting at 2:00 PM on the 24th of this month to discuss fundraising methods so that affordable rice can be sold early to feed the people.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Party and Government Circles Advocate Thrift Movement <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government yesterday approved a letter from the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, stating: "According to a report from the Fourth District Party Department of the Association, the economic situation in our country is extremely difficult. On the one hand, it is subject to the oppression of imperialist financial capitalism, and on the other hand, it is due to the people's pursuit of luxury and lack of production. Since Mr. He Yingqin initiated the thrift movement, he has called for a high level of response. Although it is a passive movement, after saving, there will be more financial investment. Consumption is used passively to achieve active purposes. National economy and people's livelihood depend on it for more benefits. Party members and civil servants should especially take the lead in setting an example to serve as a model. Therefore, we specially request the council to order all party members in the city to pay close attention and also instruct the municipal government to instruct public and commercial personnel to abide by it in order to enrich the people's livelihood. According to this, the thrift movement is indeed enriching the country and enriching the people. Party members and civil servants are models for the people and should set an example and implement it in practice. According to the previous report, in addition to ordering all district party departments to strictly abide by it, we should also send a letter to your government for reference and hope that you will instruct your subordinates to pay close attention to it." Mayor Zhang has already instructed the affiliated public security, social education, public works, public utilities, finance, and health bureaus to refer to it together.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Signing of Sino-Japanese Tariff Treaty Still Pending <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>▲Shigemitsu will go to Beijing next month.</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency said, "It has been widely rumored that the Sino-Japanese tariff treaty has been formally approved by the Japanese government, and that Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu will go to Beijing to sign it within days. In fact, these are all speculations. According to news from the Japanese embassy office yesterday, although this draft Sino-Japanese tariff treaty has been passed by the Japanese Privy Council twice, according to procedures, it must still be submitted back to the Japanese cabinet meeting for formal discussion and approval, and it must be submitted to the Japanese Emperor for approval before the Chargé d'Affaires can be instructed to sign it. It is now heard that the Japanese cabinet has scheduled a cabinet meeting around the 30th of this month to discuss this matter, and Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu Kui has been busy preparing for the celebration of the Emperor's birthday in Shanghai for days. On the 29th, the Emperor's birthday, he must host Chinese and foreign guests in Shanghai and preside over the meeting. He really has no time to go to Beijing. Therefore, the official signing date must be at the beginning of next month at the earliest. Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu has also scheduled to go to Beijing on the morning or evening of the 2nd of next month."</p>

However, the official order has not yet been issued. The former Chief of the Taxation Section, Shen Qiyu, was transferred to Chief of the Navigation Administration Section, and Zhang Xifan was appointed as Secretary.

<h3 id="e138">Naval Freshmen Arrived in Port Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>▲Because of rushing to make student uniforms</p>
<p>▲Staying in Shanghai for three or four days</p>
<p>The naval Jing'an transport ship, which carried 96 naval freshmen from Beijing the day before yesterday to study at the Fuzhou Naval Academy, sailed in from Wusongkou yesterday afternoon and arrived at the Nanjing Gaochang Temple Wharf at 1:00 p.m., moored in the Huangpu River. A reporter from the Daily News visited the ship yesterday to see the students and hear about the examination process from Captain Ouyang Ji. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Examination Process. The naval freshmen who passed the examination this time were recommended by the provincial governments. Before being sent to the Ministry of the Navy, the education authorities of each province and city conducted an examination first. Those who were admitted were all graduates of higher primary schools or above. After passing the examination, they were sent to the Ministry of the Navy for examination. A total of more than 160 people were sent from various provinces and cities. Among them, more than 40 people were not admitted due to physical examination and slightly inferior eyesight, which is a pity. Only 97 people were strictly admitted by the Examination Committee. When they were led on board the ship the day before yesterday, one student had a temporary problem, so 96 students were sent to study.</p>
<p>▲Student Age. The youngest student is 12 years old, accounting for half of the team. The oldest is only 15 years old. The students are all energetic and have no homesickness. It is commendable.</p>
<p>▲Rushing to Make Military Uniforms. Yesterday afternoon, after the ship arrived in port, the naval management office in this port ordered the new clothing store to rush to make student uniforms and leather shoes. The color of the uniforms is evergreen serge and black leather shoes. The uniforms must be rushed overnight and will be made this afternoon to distribute to the students. The casual clothes that are changed will be kept or sent to the students' homes.</p>
<p>▲Family Visits. Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 p.m., a small number of students' family elders went to the ship to visit and express their cordial greetings. The adjutant of the ship received them, which was very satisfactory to the parents. ▲Leading to See Shipyard. Yesterday, the students were not taken to visit the shipyard and various factories because the uniforms had not yet been made. After the uniforms are distributed, the captain of the ship will lead them ashore to visit the factories.</p>
<p>▲Graduation Deadline. After being admitted, the students will enter the school as recruits for six months, and then formally attend classes. Graduation from the school is five years, and then practice on the engine for one year, navigation for one year, and placement of artillery positions for one year, for a total of eight years. Only then can they be considered officially graduated. The best ones will be sent to Europe and the United States to study. However, during these eight years, they may not ask for leave to go home for no reason. There is no vacation or holiday in the school.</p>
<p>▲Departure Date. The ship was originally scheduled to stay in Shanghai for a short time after arriving. However, because the student uniforms are custom-made in Shanghai, it will not be possible to catch up in three days. Therefore, the ship will stay for about three or four days.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Unemployed Workers of Nanyang Tobacco Factory Appeal to All Circles for Assistance <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The National Society stated that the delegation of unemployed workers of the Nanyang Tobacco Company in this city issued a declaration yesterday, saying: "The Central Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, the President and Ministers of various courts and ministries of the National Government, various agencies, various newspapers, and various trade unions are all aware that since the Nanyang Tobacco Company suddenly announced at the end of the lunar year that the Shanghai factory would be closed, the company claimed that the reason for the closure was that the cost was huge, the price of gold soared, and the tariffs were too heavy, so it had to be closed. However, in reality, it had ulterior motives. Last year, it used workers' disputes, such as bribing the reorganization committee, organizing the Labor-Capital Cooperation Committee, and abolishing the trade union founded by Sun Yat-sen. All of the above provoked workers to fight each other in order to achieve its oppression and slaughter doctrine. However, people from all walks of life are still in the dark about this situation. Now, let us reiterate that after the eighth executive committee of the trade union had a dispute in May last year, the superior party department believed that its organization was poor and had to be rectified, so the reorganization committee was created. At that time, a few bad worker traitors colluded with the capitalist representative Li Hun and others in the name of reorganization. As a result, more than 200 good workers were expelled. In November, the capitalist suddenly instigated the reorganization committee to believe that the reactionary eighth executive committee of the trade union had returned to the factory, and the capitalist organized the so-called Labor-Capital Cooperation Committee, forcibly taking over all the documents of the reorganization committee, and shouting to overthrow the reorganization committee, automatically canceling the trade union, overturning the original preferential conditions for workers, and formulating a labor-capital cooperation treaty. At the same time, the capitalist bribed bad workers, and the capitalist came forward to hold a puppet congress, forcibly implementing it. Xie Li Jianfudeng also gave a speech on the stage, patting his chest and swearing that he would never fire workers at the end of the year in order to bait the workers not to oppose it. Who knows that the notice of not firing workers was not yet dry, and the closure of the factory has been seen, going back on its word and announcing a complete closure, disregarding the lives of thousands of workers. All kinds of vicious methods are aimed at making our thousands of workers starve to death as soon as possible. Moreover, this closure has not been approved by the government, and there was no indication before the deadline. They do not know that there is a party, a country, a nation, or laws. The government has promulgated the Limited Company and Factory Regulations. Companies and factories must lose more than half of their capital before they can declare bankruptcy or apply for government assistance. Only if the government cannot maintain it can it be approved to close the factory. The capital of the Nanyang Tobacco Company is 15 million yuan, and the surplus public reserve in the 14th and 15th years of the Republic of China reached more than 4 million yuan. Then, together with the original capital, the exact number is 20 million yuan. Although the 16th, 17th, and 18th years of the Republic of China reported losses, they have not yet gone bankrupt. They have only lost the public reserve, and the original assets are still intact. Therefore, the closure of the Shanghai factory is not for this reason. Moreover, the tax in Hong Kong is heavier than that in the Shanghai factory, but the Hong Kong factory is still working day and night to manufacture. Then, the reason why the company closed the Shanghai factory is not only because the price of gold and the tax rate have increased. Recently, various newspapers suddenly claimed that the Nanyang Company was operating as usual. It is expected that all circles have also understood. According to the company's statement, the factory costs are too high and the production volume is too far apart, so it has to temporarily suspend operations for reorganization. As for the collection of goods in various places, it is temporarily supplied by Hong Kong manufacturing. In reality, it entrusts San You, Zhongyuan, Xinmin and other tobacco factories to manufacture. Moreover, its announcement in Beijing claims that the collection of goods in various places has increased rather than decreased. It entrusts other factories to manufacture tobacco, falsely claiming that it is manufactured in the Hong Kong factory. All kinds of deceptive means show that the closure of the Nanyang Company is not as thorough as its declaration, and the reasons for the closure are not sufficient. The purpose is to use this as an excuse to oppress the workers. At this time when the political training has begun, the interests of the workers are carefully maintained by the late General and the orders of the government cannot allow the capitalists to freely slaughter the workers. Under the banner of the blue sky and white sun, such a major problem has occurred. People from all walks of life have been silent and speak out for our Nanyang workers, so that our thousands of workers are immersed in the sea of suffering and oppressed under the iron hoof of the capitalists. We hope that people from all walks of life will speak out for our Nanyang workers and ask the competent authorities at all levels to limit the Nanyang Tobacco Company to open the factory immediately to relieve the suffering of unemployed workers, and to negotiate with the factory on behalf of the representatives, even if they sacrifice everything, they will not hesitate to lead all the workers to resist the vicious capitalists and their lackeys in order to achieve our late General's policy of supporting the workers, and to ask the superiors to stop various tobacco factories from manufacturing tobacco for Nanyang to maintain the livelihoods of the workers. We hereby declare our slogans: (1) We want all party and government agencies to quickly order Nanyang to open the factory and resume work. (2) Overthrow the worker traitors such as Li Hui, who plotted for personal gain, auctioned off the workers, and caused this closure. (3) Ask the superior party department to stop various tobacco factories from manufacturing tobacco for Nanyang. (4) Workers, unite. (5) Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party! The Nanyang Tobacco Factory All Workers Unemployment Delegation, respectfully.</p>

<p>▲Requesting Our Country to Send Representatives to Participate</p>
<p>The International Women's Suffrage Alliance previously sent Ms. Bailey and Mrs. Camsllce Drevet as representatives to China to hold several discussions with the Chinese National Anti-Opium Society. The Alliance stated that China has suffered from foreign drug disasters and that fundamental elimination requires international cooperation. They drafted proposals and requested the two representatives to forward them, and to vigorously promote the Alliance's anti-drug movement internationally. After the two ladies returned, they actively promoted and conveyed this message, gaining the sympathy of the international women's community. The Alliance specifically established a Anti-Drug Committee to study the opium drug problem in order to show its utmost intention to cooperate with China. Branches of the Alliance have established such Anti-Drug Committees in 13 countries. Recently, a representative of the German branch of the League, Mrs. Her, came to Shanghai to meet with the Chinese National Anti-Opium Society to discuss cooperation and other matters. The results were very satisfactory. This time, the Alliance is holding the International Women's Anti-Drug Conference in Geneva, inviting representatives from anti-drug organizations and experts from various countries, as well as those enthusiastic about this issue, to participate in discussions. The Anti-Drug Society received a letter from the conference yesterday inviting them to send representatives to participate. The conference is scheduled to be held at the end of this month. The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society sent a telegram to congratulate the conference and wish it success. The content is as follows: To the Geneva International Women's Alliance Anti-Drug Conference: We have received and read your letter. We are delighted to learn that your conference is holding the International Women's Alliance Anti-Drug Conference in order to solve the international opium problem and seek the happiness of mankind, which shows your desire to save the world and your enthusiasm for rejecting drugs. After hearing about this, we feel comforted and admired. We believe that opium drugs are extremely harmful. Your alliance, with the spirit of mutual assistance and the great purpose of saving the world and saving people, shares the same goals as our society, and we should work together to eliminate the source of poison, to win glory for our country and create happiness for the world. We hereby express our congratulations and wish you success. Wang Jingqi, Chairman of the Chinese National Anti-Opium Society, Huang Jia Huiyang, Director General, respectfully.</p>

<p>The Raw Silk Inspection Office of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, since the implementation of the inspection, all parties believe that this matter is closely related to the future of the silk industry. Without considerable practice, the inspection procedures are not easy to understand. The Guangdong Provincial Construction Department's Provincial Sericulture Improvement Bureau previously sent personnel to the bureau for practical training and was very satisfied. Mr. Huang, an employee of the local Xinfu Foreign Firm, was also sent to the bureau for a week of internship. It is now known that Cheng Bingruo, a committee member of the former Wuxi Silk Factory Association, believes that the Dry Livestock Factory has been implementing blackboard inspection for a long time, but the scoring is very important and there is no standard to follow. He also does not fully understand the procedures and algorithms of public weight. Therefore, he specially sent Wang Maosheng, Ma Wenwei, and Hua Luqian to the bureau to request instructions on everything. In addition, Hou Mingxian, a graduate of the Jiangsu Provincial Women's Sericulture School, who is interested in interning in raw silk inspection, was introduced to the office by Principal Zheng Bijiang and has been assigned to the Quality Section for internship by Director Miao Zhongxiu, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Sino-Italian Airline Opens Unprecedented Fast Ship <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>▲ Can Reach Europe in 24 Days</p>
<p>▲ Major Changes Will Occur in Sino-European Shipping</p>
<p>▲ Breaking the Record of Sino-European Sea Voyage</p>
<p>The fierce competition in the shipping industry in recent years can be described as reaching its peak. Pacific US-Japan shipping companies took the lead, followed by the New York route, each investing huge capital to build fast ships. Shortening the sea voyage would give them a business advantage. On the Sino-European route, after the British company built a 16,000-ton giant ship last year, shortening the journey from Shanghai to London from 45 days to 39 days, today Blue Funnel Line and Nippon Yusen, etc., are also building strong fast ships to compete. The Italian shipping company has added two unprecedentedly fast mail ships to the Sino-Italian line for future service in Shanghai. Once opened, the Sino-European route can be shortened by more than ten days. After the news spread, a major change will occur in the European shipping industry in Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Expansion of Sino-Italian Line: The Italian postal shipping company, originally named LeoydTriestino, specializes in the Sino-Italian line with four existing postal ships and four cargo ships, each running once a month. Recently, the largest shipping company in Italy, named CisulichLine, has joined the company and is implementing a large-scale expansion of its shipping business in China in the Far East. It will start with passenger ships in order to gain a superior position on the Sino-European route. Therefore, it decided to add two of the largest passenger ships.</p>
<p>▲ Two Giant Ships Added First: The Italian post office in Shanghai has received a telegram from its home country stating that two large mail ships with a net tonnage of 24,000 tons each are being prepared to be sent to China for service, one named Saturnia and the other named Vuecania. Each ship is 631 feet long, 79 feet 6 inches wide, and 91 feet 11 inches high, divided into seven levels from top to bottom. There are 420 first-class rooms inside, including a smoking room, dance hall, swimming pool, glass garden, gymnasium, library, social hall, etc. The beauty of its setting and the size of the ship are unparalleled in the Sino-European route today, making it the largest ship.</p>
<p>▲ Arrive in Europe in 24 Days: The fastest mail ship from Shanghai to Europe (regardless of Britain, France, Italy, or Germany) takes at least 36-37 days, and ordinary ships take more than 40 days. Even the company's current three mail ships, such as the Aeskui, take 45 days to reach Italy. Now, the two newly added giant ships, powered by a motor engine, have an engine with 33,000 horsepower each, and the speed per hour exceeds 20 nautical miles. Therefore, it only takes 24 days to reach Trieste in Italy from Shanghai, reducing the sea voyage by 21 days compared to the current ships. This speed of mail ship is the first of its kind in the Far East.</p>
<p>▲ New Ships Will Come to Shanghai: The ship design drawings of the two ships have been sent to Shanghai. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai in about two months. Therefore, the company has received an order from its headquarters to stop selling tickets for the current three mail ships starting in June in order to wait for the two new ships to arrive and continue the three fast ships on schedule. It is heard that the two ships will only carry passengers and mail and will not load any cargo.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Zhuang Xueqing Commits Suicide Due to Family Pressure <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>▲ Stepmother Loves Her Young Daughter</p>
<p>▲ Years of Litigation Over Land Disputes</p>
<p>▲ Also Accused of Civil and Criminal Cases</p>
<p>▲ Zhuang Xueqing Resentfully Committed Suicide</p>
<p>Zhuang Xueqing, a local from Xiaoshiqiaotou, Pudong, committed suicide by swallowing opium yesterday afternoon due to resentment over losing a land dispute with his aunt. The situation is very complicated. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Family Situation of the Deceased: The deceased, Zhuang Xueqing, was 29 years old, a native of Pudong, who used to live at No. 12, Xiaoyangjing Miaodong, Xiaoshiqiaotou, Pudong. He used to be a copper smith on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, but he is now unemployed. His wife, Yang, is 28 years old and has a four-year-old son. Xueqing has four brothers: the eldest, Zhusheng; the second, Zhulin; Xueqing is the third; and the fourth, Zhufa. All are married.</p>
<p>▲ Adopted by Aunt as Son: Xueqing had an uncle, Jinsheng, who died of illness in 1917, leaving his wife, Zhang (Xueqing's aunt), who is now 44 years old. She had two daughters. At that time, because Zhang had no son to inherit the family line, the relatives persuaded Xueqing to be adopted as her son to inherit the property, which was about ten mu of land, including a five-room house (the base of Zhuang's residence). The land deed was managed by Xueqing himself.</p>
<p>▲ Years of Litigation Over Land Disputes: Later, Zhang's eldest daughter married, and her second daughter, Zhang Bao (now 17 years old), was also engaged to the son of a Xu family nearby. Zhang loved Zhang Bao very much and said that she would live with Zhang Bao in the future. Therefore, she changed her attitude towards her adopted son Xueqing, treating him like a thorn in her side and was unwilling to leave the property under Xueqing's control. Therefore, she gradually sold almost all of it. All that remained was one and three-tenths of a mu of homestead land and five rooms of houses in Xueqing's hands. Zhang was still not satisfied and went to court to demand the return of the land deed for the one and three-tenths of a mu of homestead land, resulting in years of litigation with Xueqing that remained unresolved.</p>
<p>▲ Dissatisfaction with Sister's Freedom: After Zhang's second daughter, Zhang Bao, was engaged to the Xu family, the two sides often interacted to show their affection. However, Xueqing believed that an unmarried woman should not often live in her future husband's house. Therefore, last year, he took Zhang Bao home. The Xu family found out and reported to the police, who arrested Xueqing and Zhang Bao and sent them to the Third District Police Station. The district chief ruled that it was a marriage dispute and refused to intervene, deepening the feud.</p>
<p>▲ Civil and Criminal Cases Came One After Another: Zhang was very angry that Xueqing interfered with her daughter's freedom and filed a criminal complaint in court, accusing him of violating the criminal law. Then, she filed a civil suit to recover the one and three-tenths of a mu of homestead land deed held by Xueqing. The land deed had been mortgaged by Xueqing to a friend for 500 yuan three years ago, and the principal and interest had not been repaid. Recently, the court repeatedly urged the return of the land deed. Xueqing had no choice but to borrow 800 yuan from relatives and friends to redeem the land deed and send it to the court for filing. At this point, Xueqing was overwhelmed by the successive criminal and civil cases, and his resentment reached its peak. ▲ Sister's Wedding Date: Xueqing Commits Suicide: Yesterday was the wedding date for Zhang's second daughter, Zhang Bao. Xueqing, seeing that the land deed had been lost and that there was no hope of recovering it, was filled with resentment and had nowhere to vent it. He became extremely angry and suddenly had the idea of committing suicide. He secretly wrote four suicide notes. At 3:00 PM, while his wife was returning to her mother's house, he suddenly swallowed opium. When his wife returned from her mother's house, only ten minutes later, she saw Xueqing lying on the bed, his face ashen. When he saw his wife arrive, he got up and held Yang's hand, but when he wanted to say something to comfort her, he was already poisoned and unable to speak. Yang was frightened and immediately sent someone to Pudong Hospital to ask a doctor to come to the house for treatment. By the time he arrived, he had already died and could not be saved. Yang hugged her husband's body and cried loudly. She then reported to the Third District Police Station and asked the local security officer to request an autopsy from the local court.</p>
<p>▲ Summary of the Suicide Note: After Xueqing's death, his wife, Yang, found four suicide notes he had left. The key points are summarized below: (Letter to Relatives and Friends): "Because Zhuang Zhang, as (should be a mistake) my aunt, in 1917, my uncle died of illness. But Xue was working in the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, and my aunt personally asked Lu Yinsheng and others to persuade me to take over the position of adopted son. I have been managing the funeral for thirteen years. I did not expect that after twelve years, my aunt would file a lawsuit to return the land deed, which has not been resolved to this day. Recently, successive civil and criminal lawsuits have come one after another, but my heart is broken, so I commit suicide and go to the West to declare that this kind of behavior is extremely sinful, my heart aches, it's injustice, it's wronged." (Farewell Letter to Wife): "My dear wife, this is a goodbye, but (only a mistake) I blame my own bad luck. In recent years, business has been very good, but I have encountered this kind of lawsuit, and I am sad and anxious, unable to sleep day and night, so (only a mistake) I can only commit suicide. You will not have enjoyment in this life, but I will repay you in the next life as an ox or a horse. Goodbye." There are two more letters, which are not important, so they are omitted.</p>

<p>▲ Tragic Situation After Yao Wang's Conviction</p>
<p>▲ Father Drowned Himself, Three Houses Demolished</p>
<p>Yao Wang, a woman from Suzhou, took young girls Zhu Xingnv, Lu Jinxiu, etc. on the Taikoo Company's Tongzhou ship from Shanghai last month, intending to go to Tianjin. When the ship was about to depart, detectives from the Women and Children Relief Society checked the ship and found them suspicious. They detained the girls Chen Yueying, etc., along with their luggage, and sent them to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office. After investigation, Yao Wang was sentenced to one year and four months in prison, and Chen Yueying was acquitted and released on bail. The two young girls, Zhu and Lu, were sent to the Women and Children Relief Society's orphanage. After Yao Wang received the verdict, she lacked the ability to appeal and had to abandon the appeal and voluntarily serve her sentence. However, Yao Wang's family had a 66-year-old father living in the countryside in Suzhou, who relied on his daughter for support. Upon receiving the news of the verdict, he drowned himself two weeks ago. At that time, relatives and friends hastily put Wang's father in a coffin and buried it in the field. Unexpectedly, a neighbor's family had a sudden illness and died, and because they suspected that the coffin was placed on the seven killers' head, they gathered many people and demolished the three houses of the person who drowned himself, leaving nothing. Yao Wang, although in custody, has been there for a total of six weeks. After her relatives notified her, she had no choice but to accept it. Although Chen Yueying was acquitted and released, the three suitcases and bedding that were detained, as well as the two young girls, Zhu and Lu, who were detained in the orphanage as victims, also became ill after being sent to the orphanage. The families have been submitting requests to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office for the return of their loved ones. The Local Court Prosecutor's Office will issue a release order as soon as the case file is returned.</p>

<p>▲ Girl Was Fast Asleep</p>
<p>▲ Awakened to Find No Way Out</p>
<p>Xu Zhongxing's home at No. 20, Jiguang Lane, Jumen Road, Ximen Xieqiao, suddenly caught fire at around 10 o'clock the night before last due to negligence. The fire was fierce, and most people were asleep. Therefore, the fire spread to the two neighboring houses across the street. It was not until the fire brigade arrived and extinguished the fire at around 11 o'clock that the fire was put out. Three houses were destroyed, and Xu's 16-year-old daughter, Du Long, was fast asleep at the time. When she awoke, she found no way out and was buried in the fire. After the Second District Police Station detained Xu Zhongxing for questioning, yesterday, Xu Du Long's body was dug out of the fire scene. Dong Jianqing, the local security officer of the 13th Picture of the 25th Bao, reported it to the Local Court for autopsy. Prosecutor Zhu and others arrived at the scene to confirm the death and ordered the body to be collected for verification.</p>

<p>Wang Baogen, 19 years old, and Cai Qianxiang, 16 years old, were apprentices at the Dalong Machinery Factory in Xiaoshadu. On the 19th of this month, they were playing in the factory when they had nothing to do. There was an air hole in the factory, and the two of them were inside and outside, throwing iron rods as a game. At first, Cai Qianxiang threw it over, and Wang Baogen picked it up and threw it back. When Cai Qianxiang stretched his head to look, the head of the iron rod hit Cai's forehead, shattering the skull. He screamed tragically and fell to the ground, blood gushing out. He was sent to the hospital and died. His father, Cai Qianshan, collected his son's body. Feeling unwilling to accept this, he reported to the Fourth District Police Station and arrested Wang Baogen. The former was sent to the Local Court for detention the day before yesterday. Prosecutor Liu ordered the family of the deceased to carry the coffin to the court for autopsy.

<p>▲ Blind Man Violently Assaulted an Eleven-Year-Old Girl</p>
<p>▲ Refuses to Accept Eight-Year Prison Sentence</p>
<p>▲ How Could He Rape If He Was Not in Shanghai?</p>
<p>▲ The Period When the Blind Man Was in Shanghai Is Worth Studying</p>
<p>Shan Huaibao, a 19-year-old man from Jiangbei, lost his eyesight at an early age. His family made him learn the art of fortune-telling to make a living. Shan lived at No. 264 Ruijin Road. Jiang Wu, a woman who lived in the same house, had an 11-year-old daughter, Wendi. At 6:00 PM on November 6th last year, Shan raped her. Afterwards, the woman filed a complaint, and the former Provisional Court sentenced Shan to eight years in prison. Shan still refused to accept this and filed an appeal. Yesterday afternoon, the Higher Branch Court opened the trial, attended by Judge Song Yuan, Judge Du Fuyue, Ye Zaizhou, and Chief Prosecutor Wang Zhennan. First, the appellant, Shan Huaibao, claimed, "Jiang Wu accused me of raping her young daughter. If it is a fact, I am willing to be punished, but I returned to my hometown from September 11th last year until I returned to Shanghai on December 23rd. On the day she accused me of raping her, I had not yet come to Shanghai, so how could I rape her? Jiang Wu lived in the front of the attic on the third floor of the house, and I lived in the back. Therefore, her mother and daughter had to pass through my room to enter the room. I also asked Wendi to buy things from time to time. All the clothes were washed by her. Once, I had a quarrel because the clothes she washed were missing, and I kicked her, which may have caused her to hate me and falsely accuse me. Moreover, she accused me of raping her on the 6th of the month, so why did she not report it to the police station until the 9th? I ask for a clear investigation." Then, according to Jiang Wu, "At 6:00 PM on November 6th last year, I was cooking when I saw Shan hurriedly descending from the attic on the third floor. I was very suspicious, so I went upstairs and saw my daughter groaning in the room. I asked her and learned that she had been bullied by Shan. According to my daughter, Shan forcibly pulled down her pants and raped her. Because Shan covered her mouth with one hand at the time, she could not shout. However, Shan knew that he had done wrong, so he fled. At first, I did not intend to publicize it, so I did not report it to the police station on that day. It was not until the 9th that Yue Li, a woman who lived in the kitchen of the house, gave me a dollar, saying that Shan's father had asked her to give it to Wendi to treat her injuries. I refused to accept it. Unexpectedly, Shan's father took the opportunity to ask me for his son, saying that his son Huaibao was missing and had been beaten to death by me. I had no choice but to send my daughter to Guangren Hospital to verify the rape injuries before filing a complaint." Also, according to the girl Jiang Wendi, "At that time, Shan called me to his room and forcibly pulled down my pants and raped me. Because he covered my mouth with one hand, I could not make a sound." Yue Li, a witness, said, "Shan Huaibao returned to Jiangbei last year, but I don't remember the date. On November 9th, Shan's father asked me to give Jiang Wu a dollar, but I don't know what it was for because the language barrier prevented me from knowing." Then, Shan's lawyer and the police lawyer debated each other. Finally, Prosecutor Wang expressed his opinion, saying that the facts of this case have been investigated clearly, and I ask the judges to make a judgment according to the law. The judge then declared the debate in this case over and adjourned the court to set a date for sentencing. Shan Huaibao was still taken back to the police station for detention.</p>

<p>The land and buildings used by the Housheng Convent on Beijing Road were to be rebuilt into the Yingshi Memorial Hall, and the Hushe had repeatedly ordered them to move through the court. The monks of the convent repeatedly delayed. Yesterday, the Special District Court closed the convent, and all the monks had been rented a house in the Wudingfang area of Wuding Road by the Society to live in temporarily. It is said that after the new building is completed in the future, the Hushe will designate an appropriate part for the convent to use.</p>

<p>The Daily News reported that the Municipal Land Bureau found that Kangyi Foreign Firm near the stadium on Jungong Road had privately rented private land to build a private road without obtaining a license and reporting it for record. In addition to ordering the firm to stop construction, it had reported to the municipal government whether to submit it to the municipal affairs meeting to discuss the handling method. Yesterday, the bureau received instructions from the municipal government, stating, "We have received the report. It is inappropriate for the foreign firm to build a private road across the public canal without applying for a license beforehand. The bureau should investigate in detail. If there is any blockage of the throat of the embankment or damage to farmland, the foreign firm should be ordered to repair and rebuild the bridge. In addition, they should complete the relevant procedures and impose a fine of 50 yuan in accordance with Article 26 of the bureau's temporary construction regulations for starting construction without a license and applying for repairs to show minor punishment. However, there are no explicit provisions in the regulations for citizens requesting the construction of bridges, docks, and revetments for the construction of private roads. The bureau should revise these regulations into the Shanghai Special City Citizens' Regulations for Requesting the Construction of Bridges, Docks, Revetments, and Private Roads and submit them for approval."</p>

<p>Madam Fan Li, a Chinese woman, was injured on November 23rd of last year when the rickshaw she was riding in was struck by an automobile driven by a foreign woman, Lei Dao, from the Lido Hotel. She filed a lawsuit with the American Assessor's Office, seeking USD 10,000 in damages. The case was heard several times, and the Assessor, Pan Di, issued a final judgment yesterday morning. Because the plaintiff's injuries were not as severe as she claimed, the defendant was ordered to pay USD 1,107. Of this, USD 207 was for loss of income due to the injury, and the remaining USD 900 was for compensation for physical injuries. Regarding the lost earrings, because they were not mentioned in the complaint, no compensation would be awarded.</p>

<p>The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company has been constructing a new power plant near the Jian Song Bridge in Yin Xing, along the riverbank. Construction began over a year ago, and the project is exceptionally large. It is reported that the construction is nearing completion. Most of the major machinery, such as boilers, steam turbines, generators, transformers, and switchboards, have been installed and completed by the Chinese and foreign engineers of the plant. The plant anticipates that all electrical equipment was shipped from abroad to Shanghai long ago. To prevent unexpected events at startup, the plant recently purchased a large quantity of firewood worth more than a thousand yuan to burn and bake, and will conduct a trial run after the moisture soaked into the equipment is completely dissipated. The date of officially supplying current will not be far off.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Investigates Customs of the Tobacco Industry <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Special District Local Court yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, we received a letter No. 1015 from the former Shanghai International Settlement Temporary Court, stating that in case No. 6323 in the General Section of the Court, several points regarding the investigation of tobacco industry customs should be investigated: (1) Whether traveling salesmen hired by tobacco leaf merchants receive commissions in addition to their monthly salaries, or whether those who receive commissions are not paid a separate salary; (2) Whether the commission received by traveling salesmen is calculated at 1% of the sales price; (3) Whether traveling salesmen who receive commissions are liable for compensation for bad debts they handle. Regarding the above points, which are pending resolution, we hereby request your association to inquire with the Tobacco Industry Association and promptly investigate and reply." The Chamber sent investigators from the Investigation Department to conduct detailed investigations at the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association and the Cigarette Industry Association tobacco firms. The investigation revealed three points: (1) Some tobacco leaf salesmen receive commissions in addition to their salaries, while others only receive commissions and do not receive a monthly salary; (2) The commission received by salesmen is calculated either by the barrel or by the percentage. Those calculated by the barrel are about US$2 to US$5 per barrel, and those calculated by the percentage range from 0.5% to 1.5% of the sales price; (3) This point is very important, and the methods of various tobacco leaf firms are very inconsistent. However, in most cases, a written or oral contract is concluded between the parties when hiring a salesman, and there is an undertaking of compensation (with full or partial compensation), or there is no undertaking of compensation. If the parties have not entered into a contract, the discovered facts must be used as a measure. For example, if the customer account released by the salesman is approved by the person in charge of the firm, then the salesman is naturally not responsible for the bad debt. If the customer account released is at the discretion of the salesman, or the salesman declares responsibility before the release, then the salesman should be responsible for compensation in the event of a bad debt. Therefore, there is no fixed custom on this point, and the facts must be weighed to make a decision standard. We are hereby sending a letter with the investigation to you. Please investigate and verify."</p>

<p>▲Beware of Pickpockets</p>
<p>In recent days, in the Public Concession, since the public bus drivers went on strike and stopped running, the trolley businesses on all lines have suddenly become prosperous. In particular, the trolleybuses on all lines are very crowded. Although the company has added vehicles, it is still not enough. As a result, the passengers are densely packed. Therefore, general pickpockets took the unique opportunity to apply their skills. As a result, cases of theft among passengers are frequently heard. At around 5:00 PM yesterday, a Mr. Cheng, who lived on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession and owned a hardware business, boarded an Route 18 trolley at the Xin Zha Bridge and got off at the Great World. His wallet containing more than 30 yuan was stolen from his pocket. Also, at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, a Mr. Zhang, who lived on Avenue Edward VII, took a trolley from Caojiadu back to Shanghai and his documents in an envelope in his pocket were stolen en route. Fortunately, there was no money in it. It is hoped that passengers will pay extra attention.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Arrests Made in Open-Air Meeting Case Transferred <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>▲Li Longzhi First Transferred, Police Apologize</p>
<p>▲Remaining Five Handed Over to Public Security Bureau for Interrogation and Return</p>
<p>On the wasteland in front of the Sanxing Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road, there was a gathering and meeting the other day. The police dispatched detectives to arrest six participants: He Qingxiang, Yao Guanghua, Li Longzhi, Chen, Chen Jiaxing, Yan Zhaotang, and Song Chaowei. Along with anti-government printed materials, they were escorted to the Higher Branch Court for interrogation and detention. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has been learned that one of the arrested, Li Longzhi, claimed to be from Beiping. However, after a detailed investigation by the police, it was confirmed that Li was indeed a Korean. Previously, he had been arrested by Japanese authorities in Korea for anti-government activities. He escaped while under investigation and came to China by ship from the United States. After arriving in Shanghai, he joined the Communist organization in Shanghai. The day before yesterday, in the early morning, he and his accomplices participated in an open-air meeting in front of the yarn factory and were arrested by the police. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai, believing that Li was an important fugitive, specially sent police officers to the political department of the general police station the day before yesterday evening to take Li to the Japanese Consulate. Yesterday morning, the police only transferred the remaining five to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. Judge Ye Zaichou continued to preside over the preliminary hearing. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, first stated that the Japanese Consulate had sent someone to take Li Longzhi, saying that since Li was a Korean, the Court had no jurisdiction over him and was therefore taken away. However, the Japanese Consulate sent someone to the police station to pick him up near dusk, so it was not possible to ask for instructions in advance. The police apologized deeply, but because of the time constraints, they hoped that the Court would understand. Then, a representative from the Municipal Public Security Bureau delivered an official document requesting that the remaining five be transferred to them. Judge Ye immediately interrogated each defendant and approved the transfer of He Qingxiang and the other four to the officer Nie Yaxi for interrogation. After the Public Security Bureau returns them, the Special District Court will schedule a hearing. Regarding Li Longzhi's part, the police were ordered to submit written evidence for record.</p>

<p>▲Zhang Bingsheng and His Mistress in the Branch Court</p>
<p>▲The Rest Transferred to the Special District Court</p>
<p>Regarding the case of forged official seals and fake letters of appointment found in house number 1132, Tongchun Lane, Gongping Road, and the subsequent arrest of many men and women, after investigation by the police, only Lin Jinhan and other men and women were involved in counter-revolutionary suspicions and were ordered by the Higher Branch Court to be detained for investigation. The remaining five men and women, including Yan Changfu, were related to the robbery case and have been transferred to the Special District Local Court to await trial. According to previous reports, the police continued to investigate and found that Lin Jinhan and Zhao Jiaying were also not involved in the counter-revolutionary case and were in fact accomplices of Yan Changfu and others who had been transferred to the Special District Court to await trial. The 2,000 yuan in banknotes from the Northeast Provinces found at Zhao Jiaying's residence were赃 款 the spoils obtained from the robbery. Yesterday morning, the police transferred Lin and Zhao to the Higher Branch Court again, stating the investigation process and requesting a transfer of trial. Judge Gao Junxiang interrogated Lin and Zhao and approved the police's request to transfer them to the Special District Local Court to await trial. Of all the people arrested in the case, only Zhang Bingsheng and his mistress, Zhang Wangshi, are still suspected of counter-revolutionary activities and are being detained in the Higher Branch Court for investigation.</p>

<p>The car of Tan Xinzhen, a former judge of the criminal court of the Temporary Court, was driven by Zhang Cheng, a Shandong native and assistant to the car's driver Chen Xiaosi, who had no driving experience. He sped in an empty car along Tianjin Road and Guizhou Road, resulting in the deaths of an old man and injuries to five men and women in an instant. This kind of tragedy is rare. The details of the accident have been reported twice in this newspaper. However, the most seriously injured of the five was Cai Shunsheng, who also died in the hospital at 11:00 AM the day before yesterday. Cai was from Ningbo, and his aunt, Cai Shaoshi, was at home when she heard that Shunsheng and Shunsheng's wife, A Bao, were injured in a car accident. She took a boat to Shanghai, but her nephew had already died when she arrived. The Laoza Police Station sent detective Zhao Rongsheng to transport Shunsheng's body to the forensic examination office on Flandre Road at noon the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, they reported to the Special District Local Court and commissioned Prosecutor Guo to come to the office to examine the body and inquire about the situation. He instructed Cai Shaoshi to sign a bond to claim the body for burial and to hear the case at a later date. So far, the case has resulted in two deaths, Jiang Bainian and Cai Shunsheng, and of the injured, apart from Jiang Zi and Jiang Changlin, who suffered minor injuries and have been discharged from the hospital, there are still three people, Zhu Peiyuan, Tang Desheng, and the deceased Shunsheng's wife, Cai A Bao, who are still receiving treatment in the hospital.</p>

<p>▲Related to the Zhu Youqing Family Robbery Case</p>
<p>Zhang Jinmao, from Pudong, was involved in a case where Zhu Shaoqing's family in Gaoqiao Township, Pudong, was attacked by a gang with weapons on the night of the 22nd of last month, and the robbery failed, and the victim was shot and injured. The local police first detained Zhang's father, and then, together with detective Liu Chunshu from the police station, arrested Jinmao in the rooftop garden of the New World Company and escorted him to the Special District Local Court, which ordered him to be detained pending transfer. This has been reported in previous newspapers. The Municipal Public Security Bureau prepared an official document and sent patrol officer Zhao Ruji to the court yesterday morning to apply for the transfer. Judge Sun took the bench and ordered Zhang Jinmao to be brought up for preliminary hearing. After Patrol Officer Zhao presented the official document, a detective from the Public Security Bureau stated that Zhu Shaoqing, the victim, received a letter signed by the defendant not long after Zhang's father was detained, asking him not to pursue the matter against his father, otherwise he would retaliate with extreme measures. According to our investigation, Zhang Jinmao is indeed the leader of the Thirty-Six Gang, etc. Zhu Shaoqing also testified that Zhang Jinmao fired a shot that night, and the bullet flew over my head, etc. Zhang did not admit it. Judge Sun concluded the preliminary hearing and handed Zhang Jinmao over to the officer from the Public Security Bureau to take him away for investigation.</p>

<p>▲American Feng Bank Withdraws Lawsuit</p>
<p>▲Zhang Sues Based on Comprador Contract</p>
<p>Cheng A'gen of the Feilong Automobile Company previously ordered a car and the American Feng Bank pledged the funds. However, they ignored the pledged funds, exceeding tens of thousands, and were sued by the bank. After a ruling by the former Temporary Court, one party refused to accept the ruling and filed an appeal with the Chinese and Foreign Civil Appeals Office of the former Diplomatic Affairs Department. At the end of last year, the Diplomatic Affairs Department was ordered to be abolished, and the attached Appeals Office ceased operations. The case was therefore not heard. However, the American Feng Bank's pledge was made by the comprador Zhang Xingcun. Now that Zhang has resigned, the bank believes that according to the comprador contract signed with Zhang, all funds handled by Zhang should be cleared upon resignation. Therefore, the funds owed by Cheng have already been compensated by Zhang, and Zhang has obtained the assignment of the creditor's rights. Zhang then hired lawyer Shen Yuesheng and filed a lawsuit with the Special District Local Court, requesting a judgment ordering the defendant Cheng A'gen to repay the funds paid on his behalf. Yesterday morning, Judge Ying Shi presided over the hearing. Lawyer Shen stated the details of the case and submitted several copies of the American Feng Bank's judgment against Cheng as evidence. The defendant Cheng A'gen did not appear, and lawyer Fan Gang appeared as his agent and argued that the case had already been appealed and should await the appellate court's judgment. Furthermore, the defendant's dispute was with the American Feng Bank, and it is incomprehensible that Mr. Zhang is now suing. Lawyer Shen then restated the course of events, saying that the appeal had been withdrawn, and that Zhang Xingcun had already compensated the funds according to the comprador contract and had notified the defendant after obtaining the right to assign the creditor's rights from the American Feng Bank, so Zhang had the right to sue. The presiding judge immediately instructed Lawyer Shen to submit evidence of notifying the defendant and detailed accounts for further investigation.</p>

<p>▲The Cause and Effect of Zhang Laoer's Case and Han's Private Affair</p>
<p>Cai Shusen, a tailor residing in Sanlin Tang in Pudong, previously married a woman from Danyang, Han A'san, also known as Cai Han's wife, because he lacked someone to take care of his household. She was a loose woman and not accustomed to the hardships of village life. Later, she had an affair with Zhang Laoer and ran away with silver jewelry in January, and disappeared. Cai searched everywhere, but there was no news. Now, it has been discovered that Zhang and the woman were hiding in Danyang, so he filed a complaint with the county public security bureau, requesting an investigation. Now, the bureau has prepared a document ordering detectives Qi Jie, Xun Tan Ren Xiangyun, Gu Xingzhou, and Wang Changlin to go to Danyang, together with the county government, to arrest Zhang Laoer, Cai Han's wife, and the implicated woman's brother Han Chengzi, as well as the women Liu Zhushi and Tang Wenji.

<p>▲Unable to Bear Oppression, He Planned To End It</p>
<p>The ferry at the Fenshan Wharf in Pudong loaded more than 20 passengers from Hongkou, Puxi, at 8:00 AM yesterday and sailed back to Pudong. Unexpectedly, as the boat reached the center of the river, a passenger, about 40 years old, walked out of the cabin and jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, the tide was calm at the time, and he immediately resurfaced. The boatman used a bamboo pole to hook him and rescue him from drowning. The boat then arrived at the Pudong wharf, and the passenger was handed over to the police of the Fourth Squadron, who transferred him to the Third District of the Public Security Bureau. He confessed that his name was Sun Xinqi, 44 years old, from Qingjiang. He lived at 21 Qianyi Lane, Hujia Muqiao, Hongkou. He owned the Jin Shuangquan Bathhouse in that area. The business was not bad, but later friends such as Yin Xinzhi joined as shareholders, and the business gradually declined, resulting in huge losses. Now Yin and others plan to sell the bathhouse, but I did not agree and was often humiliated. Recently, they colluded with hoodlums and impersonated detectives, forcing me to sign a contract to sell the business, but I refused. I originally planned to file a lawsuit in court, but I have no money. After thinking about it, I could not bear the oppression, so I jumped into the river, etc. A yellow paper grievance and an account book were found on Sun. The district chief, considering that Sun's confession was pitiful, ordered him to be escorted to the General Public Security Bureau for interrogation in the afternoon.</p>

<p>▲Debate Concluded Yesterday, Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Zhang Tianxing, the leader of the third team of the Self-Defense Corps in Delan Lane No. 22, Shipi Lane, shot and killed his fiancée Wang Xiaomei with a pistol on the 8th of this month. Prosecutor Li completed the investigation of this case and believed that although Zhang Tianxing had no intention to kill, the responsibility for causing death through negligence could not be waived. Therefore, he filed a public prosecution citing Article 291 of the Criminal Law. The trial was held by Judge Deng yesterday morning. The defendant Zhang Tianxing stated that Wang Xiaomei herself pulled the gun to look at it, causing a stray bullet to be fired and killed. The official asked, "She used her hand to pull it, you should have stopped her." (Answer) "I didn't expect it." (Question) "There were bullets in the gun, you shouldn't have let her pull it." (Answer) "She came up from downstairs and immediately started pulling it." (Question) "Did you have a grudge against Wang Xiaomei?" (Answer) "No." (Question) "Did you deliberately kill her?" (Answer) "If I wanted to kill her, I wouldn't have scheduled a wedding date with her." (Question) "Who are Wang Xiaomei's family members?" (Answer) "Her parents and brother." At this point, his brother Zhang Jinfu testified, "Wang Xiaomei was shot on the 8th of this month. Although I was in the room, I didn't see how it happened." A neighbor, Xu Zhongyuan, testified that he lived at number 21, and he only heard about it afterwards, saying that she was playing with a handgun, which resulted in her death. He did not witness it. At this point, Prosecutor Li made his closing statement, mainly arguing that the defendant could not waive his criminal responsibility and requested that he be sentenced according to law. The defendant's defense lawyer, Sha Xunyi, requested that the defendant be declared innocent or, if found guilty, that the sentence be suspended. The judge announced the conclusion of the debate, scheduled the sentencing date, and adjourned the court.</p>

<p>A local man named Chen, residing at number 49 Zhao Jiawan outside Xiaonanmen, works in a foreign company, so his family has considerable savings, which has made him a target for bandits. The Chen family has received threatening letters in succession, but they ignored them. Unexpectedly, they received another letter the other day, in which the wording was very intense, and they were asked to bring the money to the wood in front of the Zhengde Elementary School in Huang Xinyi Ham between 9:00 PM and 10:00 PM. Use old newspapers as a sign. Chen immediately reported to the South Station Seventh Detachment of the Songhu Self-Defense Corps for investigation.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the report, team leader Ma Wenda, went to Pudong for entertainment that night. The team members Gu Guoan, Zhang Rengui, Jin Shunchang, Zhang Sheng, Yu Ruixiang, Peng Rongzhu, etc. went in disguise. They did not go with the director of the third sub-office of the first district in charge of the area. After arriving at the destination, they saw a newspaper on the wood. Each lurked in the bamboo fence on the other side. At about 11:00 PM, a tall person came to take the newspaper. The team members rushed forward and ordered him to stop. At that time, the man still moved forward. Team member Gu Guoan immediately drew a pistol and fired at him, hitting him in the right armpit. He was injured and bleeding on the spot, and was immediately arrested and sent to the first district and third sub-office to ask for instructions. The director of the sub-office Jin ordered them to return to the team and prepare a formal document for verification, because he had not been notified of the matter in advance. The team members sent the injured person to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, and notified team leader Ma to return to the team by phone. The injured person was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. It is said that the man's name is Li Zhongyi, 37 years old, from Zhili, and he has been living with his wife Wang in house number 37 Tangfang Lane outside Xiaonanmen for many years. They have three sons. The eldest is named A Xing, who is 17 years old, the second is named Didi, who is also three years old, and the youngest is only three months old and is still in swaddling clothes. I usually lend money at high interest rates for a living. Last night I went to Chouchang Street to collect high-interest money. When I passed Huang Xinyi Ham, I suddenly saw a newspaper on the wood. Because the copper coins I was carrying were too heavy, I went forward to pick up the newspaper, intending to wrap the copper coins. Suddenly, many people came up and grabbed me. Because they were afraid that I would resist, they fired a shot and hit me in my right armpit. The bullet did not penetrate. Now the doctor has managed to remove the bullet. It is said that the injury is not serious, but after the wound heals, my right hand may be disabled.</p>

<p>▲ The Current Situation is Extremely Urgent</p>
<p>To Chairman Xu and Committee Member Wang of the Shanghai Office of the Relief Committee of Yunnan Road, Shanghai: The urgency for disaster relief in Henan has been repeatedly telegraphed. Currently, the counties of Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Bianliang, and Qinbo Mengxin have taken in 100,000 disaster victims, but the relief funds have been exhausted. There is no sustenance for raising them, and no funds for sending them away. The precarious situation is such that they do not even consider the next day. Looking around the disaster areas in various counties, many are unable to escape far due to transportation obstructions. The number of those who are displaced and dying is countless. The early autumn planting season is approaching, and food supplies are cut off. There are no seeds, and if cultivation is delayed, there will be another autumn famine. What have the people of Henan done to deserve this? They are facing imminent death. Our association lacks the resources to raise funds and is deeply worried. We have heard that American relief funds will be remitted to China. We earnestly request you to consider the severity of the disaster in Henan and allocate more funds for relief, providing prompt assistance to rescue the dying victims who are eagerly awaiting help. This telegram is urgent. We await your instructions. Zhang Fang, Relief Association of Henan Province, bows in supplication. (One) Zhou Xiaofan of Yuxing Public Company, Republic Road, Shanghai, is aware: Our association's relief funds have been exhausted and we cannot maintain it. The counties of Shanxi, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Bianliang, and Qinbo Mengxin have taken in 100,000 disaster victims. There is no food to raise them, and no funds to send them away. The current situation is extremely urgent. The early autumn planting season is approaching, and the disaster areas have no farming tools or seeds. If cultivation is delayed, there will be another autumn famine. Disasters follow one after another, and there seems to be no end in sight. We have telegraphed Xu Junlao and Wang Yilao in advance to borrow 100,000 yuan to alleviate the immediate crisis. Once the American relief funds are allocated, we will return the amount in full. If it is difficult to manage, we can use Zhang Fang's personal integrity as collateral or mortgage the Minsheng Coal Mine to borrow 100,000 yuan from various banks to first save the currently dying victims. Please reply by telegram regarding the progress. Zhang Fang, Relief Association of Henan Province, anxiously requests. (One) To Chairman Xu and Committee Member Wang of the Shanghai Office of the Relief Committee of Yunnan Road, Shanghai: The telegram has been sent. Unfortunately, Henan Province has once again fallen into the war zone. Transportation is obstructed, and life is cut off. Shanxi, Luoyang, Bianliang, Zhengzhou, Qinbo Mengxin have taken in nearly 100,000 disaster victims, providing food based on headcount. Relief funds are completely depleted; we want to send them away but have no funds, and we want to send them to a new place but there is no road. Moreover, when the victims return home, they have no seeds and cannot cultivate the land. If we do not urgently seek relief, they may all fill the ditches. Furthermore, the current situation cannot be maintained, and it is extremely precarious. Therefore, we are sending another telegram to earnestly request prompt assistance. If the American funds can arrive early, please allocate them immediately. If it will still take time, the disaster situation in the province is so urgent that we have no choice but to implore the great virtues of the two gentlemen to temporarily borrow 100,000 yuan in cash in Shanghai and remit it to Bianliang as soon as possible to maintain the situation and rescue those in danger. We can use Zhang Fang's personal integrity or the Minsheng Coal Mine Company that he manages as collateral. The situation is urgent, and we await your assistance. If you approve, we will be eternally grateful. Zhang Fang, Relief Association of Henan Province, bows in supplication. (One) To Director Wang of the Shanghai Chinese Red Cross Society: Your supportive telegram is acknowledged. We are very grateful for the funds you have allocated for the two-month expenses of the shelter. However, we are currently sheltering over 1,800 women and children, which is one-third more than before. The required expenses also need to be increased by another 1,400 yuan per month to cover the expenses. We earnestly request you to grant additional funds to maintain and expand relief efforts. This is our sincere hope. Zhang Fang, Relief Association of Henan Province, bows in supplication. (One) To Mr. Zhang Weichen and other gentlemen at the Asia Hotel, Nanjin Kou: Your supportive telegram is acknowledged. We will do our best to maintain relief efforts. Recently, relief funds have been exhausted. The counties of Shanxi, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Bianliang, and Qinbo Mengxin have taken in disaster victims. There is no food to raise them, and no funds to send them away. The current situation is extremely urgent. The autumn planting season is approaching, and the disaster areas have no farming tools or seeds. If cultivation is delayed, there will be another autumn famine. Please actively appeal for assistance to provide relief. This is our hope. Zhang Fang, Relief Association of Henan Province, bows in supplication. (One) To Commander-in-Chief Yan in Taiyuan and Commander-in-Chief Feng in Tongguan: In Henan Province, years of bandits and military plundering have caused both calamity and decline. The relief efforts have been exhausted. Shanxi, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Bianliang, and the northern parts of Henan, such as Xinxiang, have taken in nearly hundreds of thousands of disaster victims. There is no food to continue raising them, and no funds to transfer them. How can we bear to watch them die? It is the time for spring plowing, but people have left and fields are barren, adding disaster upon disaster. The future is even more concerning. We hope that you will feel the pain and consider the plight of the disaster victims. We earnestly request you to show compassion to the disaster victims and immediately allocate large sums of money to Henan, which will be managed by our association. We will prudently distribute funds and seeds to help them return to their hometowns. For those who are inherently poor and unemployed, we also request you to instruct the Pinghan and Longhai Railway Bureaus to order the stationmasters of each section to allocate vehicles to facilitate the transfer to the eastern provinces, allowing them to seek a livelihood on their own. We express these urgent words and hope you will pay attention. Zhang Fang, Relief Association of Henan Province, bows in supplication.</p>

(5) This week's receipts of relief funds. Discussion matters:</p>
<p>Mr. Gao Henian of Xinghua telegraphed, requesting an additional allocation of 10,000 yuan for spring relief and prompt remittance. Director Zhu also telegraphed, requesting continued fundraising in addition to the additional allocation of 10,000 yuan for spring relief. The association's relief funds have been exhausted, and there is no source for the additional funds. However, the disaster situation in Xing is indeed dire, and an additional allocation is necessary. How to respond? Zhi Gong's response resolution. The resolution was that an additional 10,000 yuan would be allocated, already included in the budget, and will be telegraphed once funds are raised. (3) Spring Relief in Huai'an: Director Liu had previously telegraphed Mr. Lu Yu, repeatedly stating the insufficient funds situation. The association telegraphed Mr. Zhu Yusheng to raise additional funds in Pingjin, which was approved for an additional 1,000 yuan. The shortfall is still significant. Can the association devise a method to increase the funds? Please resolve the case. The resolution was that the association would raise an additional 2,000 yuan.</p>

However, due to the dense fog at sea, the work is very difficult. The loss of the Japanese ship was also caused by the fog. The Guangli happened to be coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong and, after receiving the Japanese ship's wireless distress signal, ventured to rescue. According to subsequent telegrams, the Japanese crew members have now been transported to Xiamen by the Guangli.</p>

<p>— Qifei</p>
<p>Dr. George Margouliès, recently appointed by the French Ministry of Education, came to China to investigate higher education. He is very knowledgeable in Chinese studies, so after arriving in Beijing, he has been giving lectures and attending social events every day. Many of the people in the new capital are old friends of the doctor, and the doctor also likes Chinese students very much and goes to talk with them. He has the demeanor of Kong Rong. As for the doctor's past experiences and his lectures, various newspapers have already reported them. I will collect more of his anecdotes and record them in Free Talk. (The following is what the doctor said)</p>
<p>I love to recite Han Fu and Six Dynasties literature. Although I have translated them myself, I have always thought it was wrong. Han Fu and parallel prose each have their own beauty, and translation destroys their color and texture. It is like a flower, only the branches and trunk remain.</p>
<p>Chinese literature is unique and stands in opposition to the group of Western countries. It has its own essence, and neither can surpass the other. Common people compare Li Bai with Du Fu, which loses their unity and is meaningless.</p>
<p>I am deeply fascinated by China. If someone asks me to criticize it, I really don't know what to say. I have been immersed in Chinese culture for a long time, and this trip will fulfill my long-cherished wish.</p>
<p>Among Chinese poets, I love Tao Yuanming the most. He has a great influence on literary history, and the Tang and Song poets were all influenced by him. He took nature as his model and Lao Zhuang as his backbone, transforming the ornate into the simple and elegant. Tao is truly a poet of the world.</p>
<p>Chinese prose is very high in its realm and is indeed a specialized art. Its completion should be after the Tang and Song dynasties. I love its poetic meaning and mixed rhyme, such as Liu Zongyuan's travel notes. The Tongcheng school of the Qing dynasty is gentle and secluded, and I also like it.</p>
<p>The author used Mr. Zhao Shourun to make it easier for the doctor to listen to his voice. The first three sections of this article are what the doctor said at the time, and the latter two were heard by student Fang Weide. The doctor speaks Chinese when talking to people, using simple and straightforward language, mixed with colloquialisms. His erudition and talent are truly extraordinary.</p>
<h3 id="e189">A Short Record of Seeking Fragrance Under the Moon <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Jingmengdie</p>
<p>The weeping crabapple, also known as the Drunken Beauty, see Hui Feng's Ci Hua saying "This flower is only found in my hometown (Lingui). Grafted onto cherry trees. It has not been seen in northern Ji or southern Jiangnan." Now there are several of these flowers in the Wuxi Park. In the late spring of March, the flowering season is already over, but Mr. Qian Mingshan of Changzhou suddenly passed through Wuxi on business. In the evening, I served him drinks in the hotel, which is the park hotel. During the meal, Mr. Qian said that he had taken a walk in the park and saw that all the flowers had withered, but only a few crabapple trees were still smiling. It was very pleasant. He praised it endlessly. I then responded by saying, "Tonight, the moon shines on the crabapple blossoms. There is no need to burn red candles. Why not go again to seek fragrance under the moon and enjoy the remaining fun? Moreover, after several nights of wind and rain, the moon tonight is clearly intended by Chang'e to welcome honored guests. How can we carelessly disappoint her?" Mr. Qian smiled and nodded. After the meal, he and the other guests went downstairs and entered the park, winding their way to the crabapple blossoms. At that time, the crescent moon had just emerged from the clouds. Although the tall pines were shady, the light leaked through the gaps. The crabapple blossoms that first caught the moonlight suddenly appeared in color, like pearl light and precious energy, breaking through the darkness. However, the blush and halo of the Drunken Beauty were no longer recognizable. Only a white one like a pear blossom was seen. That lovely red child suddenly transformed into Wenjun in plain clothes and Guoguo with a bare face. It was strange. After a while, a layer of pale moonlight permeated the forest, blurring the outside of the flowers, like a veil or a crystal curtain, making people imagine the ancient walking screen ladies and the veiled palace maids. This is what one can gain under the moon. Its interest is very different from that of the whip silk hat shadow. Later, we left.</p>
<h3 id="e190">The Invention of Artificial Blood <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Guoxin</p>
<p>A Parisian dispatch reports that Mr. Naumoff, who has long served in the French army, recently invented a type of artificial blood. Its function is no different from that of human blood. It has been repeatedly tested by the most famous biologists in France, and they are all very satisfied. It is especially effective in treating blood loss.</p>
<p>When it was first invented, dogs were used as test subjects. The French first extracted all the blood from the dog's body, causing it to be on the verge of death. Then, this artificial blood was injected. In less than five minutes, the dog was jumping, eating, and drinking as usual.</p>
<p>Later, when the European War began, Naumoff applied this artificial blood to injured soldiers who had lost too much blood, and it was immediately effective. It is estimated that no fewer than several hundred people were saved.</p>
<p>The formula for its ingredients is very simple. The raw materials used are only soda salt and magnesium oxide powder. The reason for using magnesium oxide powder is that soda salt is very toxic and it is not enough to detoxify it.</p>
<p>According to Western medicine, the only treatment for blood loss is blood transfusion. However, it is not always easy to find a suitable donor. Now that this alternative has been invented, those suffering from blood loss can sleep soundly without worry.</p>
<h3 id="e191">A Record of Orchids Below the Wild Boar Peak of Ma'anshan <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Diweng</p>
<p>In the first ten days of the month, the rain had just cleared, and the spring was bright and clear. Two or three friends made an appointment to visit Ma'anshan in Kuncheng. Ma'anshan is named after its shape. The mountain produces strange stones that are as bright and clean as jade, so it is also called Yushan or Yu Peak. The eastern peak of the mountain has towering rocks stacked on top of each other, which is quite spectacular. At its foot is the tomb of Liu Longzhou. However, it is not as good as the western peak. The western peak is higher, and the rocks are constantly towering, looking like a group of beasts, so it is called Wild Boar Peak. On this day, we climbed from the eastern peak to the western peak. The fragrance of orchids wafted in, and we thought it must be the orchids planted by the monks in the Buddhist temple. When we arrived at the temple, there were no orchids. We asked the monks, and they replied that the orchids were below Wild Boar Peak, in the concave part of the valley. The flowers and leaves cannot be seen, but the fragrance of orchids can be smelled. This happens every year. Because the valley is secluded and deep, people dare not descend the dangerous cliff, so no one can transplant them. I sighed and said, "The orchid grows in an empty valley, and it does not stop being fragrant because it is not worn by anyone. This is what it means." A guest said, "Zheng Banqiao's poem has the line 'Discussing carrying poles on the street corner.' Why is it so cheap? And the inscription on the broken pot of orchids that he painted says, 'Now that I think about it carefully, there are no confidants. I broke the bird pot and went into the mountains again.' It is also fortunate." I said, "If I had known today, I would have regretted not doing it sooner. The orchids of this mountain are hidden in a secluded valley, touching people with their fragrance, and are not played with by people. It can be said that they have found their place." Afterwards, we went down from another path and sat on the grass in the sports field, looking at Wild Boar Peak. The orchids were even more amazing, and the fragrance of the orchids still lingered in our noses.</p>

<p>— Guoxin</p>
<p>American Mr. Francis Jenkins recently invented an aerial image transmitter. Whenever an aircraft passes in the air, images can be immediately transmitted everywhere by this image transmitter, so that those below can see the space they have traveled through without lifting a foot. Mr. Jenkins has now configured this instrument and will conduct a field test soon. He has named it the "Aerial Eye." This invention is not only for entertainment, but will also occupy an extremely important position in the military. During wartime, it can be used to observe the contents of the enemy's army using this aerial eye.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Travels in Nanyang (Sixteen) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the 22nd, I visited Mr. Bao Chuanxian, the manager of the Commercial Press. The Commercial Press has made significant contributions to culture in Nanyang. They published my books fifteen years ago. We had a long conversation about cultural endeavors in Nanyang. Generally, the reason our overseas Chinese go abroad is nothing more than the immigration issue. It is said that Yunnan has a very good climate and terrain, and some people want to start new living communities there. However, other friends say that there is still much land in the Malay Peninsula that can be developed. In the future, there will be a continuous stream of Chinese people going abroad, and many may go to Malaya. There is a Mr. Wu Juefei who lives in Wuzhou, and he mentioned matters in Guangxi. I said, Guangxi has vast land and a sparse population, and its scenery is unparalleled. Some people in its political circles once wanted to immigrate one million people from the northern provinces. I initially thought it was unbelievable, but after touring Guangxi again a year later, I realized that there was a lot of wasteland, and it could accommodate more than one million immigrants. If the internal strife is quelled, Guangxi could be a good place to establish new villages, and obtaining land from the government would not require money. Mr. Bao asked me about regions in the north suitable for immigration. I said that the three northeastern provinces have very large areas, and many people from Shandong Province go there, but few from Jiangnan. Some people from Shandong also operate in the Suiyuan and Hetao areas, and I heard that Mr. Wang Hongyi has made good profits buying land and running reclamation there. However, for people from Jiangnan, the climate is ultimately too cold. The best place I know of is Guangxi. The Malayan issue is worth studying in the future. It could be a major outlet for us Chinese.</p>
<p>Although this place is overseas, there are plenty of poets and writers to see. There is a Tan Xie Poetry Society. I traveled around the hills with them. The most abundant thing here is coconut trees. In English, it's Cocoa or Coconut. The fruit is called a coconut, and they are everywhere, like willows in the north. They can be six or seven zhang, up to eight or nine zhang tall. They grow about one zhang or seven or eight chi each year. Their leaves droop and hang down, like hanging hair. The fruit is like a small watermelon, and the shell is very hard. It must be chopped with an axe. The meat of this large fruit is very edible and tastes like peanuts. The spring juice can be drunk. Each fruit contains one pound to at least half a catty of juice. The fruit can be made into oil, like peanut oil in our country, which can be eaten and used. It can also be made into sugar, but we people are not used to eating it. The juice can be made into curry, so the people of Nanyang call the coconut a divine tree. However, the trunk is herbaceous rather than woody. The stem stands straight up in the sky. Coconut groves are everywhere here, a place for scholars and ladies to rest. Poetic sentiments and lyrics are all related to the coconut grove. Therefore, I wrote a poem to commemorate it:</p>
<p>The coconut tree stands tall, several zhang high,</p>
<p>Its beautiful tresses are scattered by the wind.</p>
<p>The fruit can be eaten, the juice can be drunk,</p>
<p>Beneath the trees, the moonlight whispers.</p>
<p>Here, it is necessary to distinguish between the coconut tree and the betel palm. I asked people for a long time, and many gave vague answers. Later, I learned the distinguishing points. The betel palm is straight and thin, with small leaves. The leaves are at the tip. Coconut leaves are wide and numerous. The trunk is rough and not smooth. The beauty of the leaves of the Go tree are arranged at natural angles, just like a Chinese paper fan, which is also a wonder. There are also red lotus flowers, which are not flowers, but leaves that are made into flowers. They are everywhere and do not fall in all seasons, like hydrangea.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Wonderful Rat Poison <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Sang Junfu</p>
<p>A rat infestation is a great source of hatred in a home. They rummage around at night, disturbing people's peaceful sleep, destroying clothing, and causing plague. Their crimes are especially hateful and punishable. My friend Mr. Lu is close friends with the famous Shanghai doctor Hong Weitang. Yesterday, he came to my residence for a pleasant chat and described to me a wonderful rat poison recently invented by Doctor Hong. It was very interesting. He said that he had tried it in practice and it was very effective. It is truly effective. It can catch rats with almost no misses. Calling it a wonderful rat poison is no exaggeration. Therefore, I am recording his method and sending it to Juanweng, so that those who hate rats can know how to catch and kill them and live in peace.</p>
<p>The method is to grind "noisy willow catkins" into powder and mix it with "crab roe" to make a slurry. (Note: "Noisy willow catkins" and crab roe are sold in pharmacies everywhere.) Then, on benzoin, wait until it is dry, and insert the incense into a bowl of rice. At night, when it is quiet, light the incense. When the rats smell the fragrance, they will all flock to it. After about an hour, the rats will be severely stimulated by the poison and will be exhausted and unable to support themselves. They will collapse. Then we can easily catch them one by one, or feed them to a healthy cat, which will devour them completely. This method is excellent. However, one thing to pay attention to at the time is that the doors and windows of the room must be tightly closed, so that it is airtight, so that the fragrance does not leak out, and the effect will be magical. The method is simple. Homeowners, why not give it a try?</p>

<p>Lu Liangsheng of She County was a merchant in Xuancheng. He raised a dog that accompanied him in and out for many years. A hunter admired its speed and agility and earnestly asked Lu to sell it to him, offering eight taels of silver. He took it back to Huizhou. Every time he went hunting, the dog's catch was twice that of other dogs. After three months, the dog suddenly disappeared. The hunter suspected that it had escaped back and searched for it to Lu's house. The dog was indeed there. When it saw the hunter, it quickly fled into the inner room and hid under the stove. No matter how he called it, it would not come out, as if it missed its old master and could not bear to leave. Liangsheng pitied it and returned the original price and kept the dog. From Huizhou to Xuancheng is more than 300 li away, and it was able to recognize its old road and return to its original owner. This further confirms the story of the yellow dog delivering letters, which is no lie. My friend was an official in Xuan and told me about it upon his return, so I wrote it down.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Ten: Red Flames Rise to the Sky, Courtesan Admires Filial Piety, Red Carpet Laid Out, Famous Actors Met</p>
<p>At this time, Lord Yan whispered to Wen Guizhi, "After you finish your performance today, come to my lodging. I have something to say to you. Come by yourself. I won't send anyone to call you again." After listening to his words, Wen Guizhi went to Lord Yan's lodging after finishing her performance. Originally, they had a good relationship. That day, she stayed there. The next morning, Lord Yan gave her five hundred yuan and said, "Take this. The weather is getting warmer. Make the clothes you urgently need first. If it's not enough, ask me for more." Fortunately, it's been less than a month. In the future, you can make whatever clothes you like. I'll be going to Beijing after the festival. There are some things you can prepare." Originally, that night, Lord Yan had decided to marry Wen Guizhi. The two had discussed it thoroughly. However, according to the rules in Shanghai's brothels, there are all sorts of troubles when marrying in the middle of a season. Therefore, they procrastinated for more than ten days, waiting for the Dragon Boat Festival to pass. Then Wen Guizhi removed her sign and officially became a respectable woman. She followed Lord Yan away. That Lord Yan was a famous scholar. Wen Guizhi jumped from a 'mo er' to a 'chang san,' and she was also a beauty. A famous scholar and a beauty naturally make a great match. As the ancients said, "May all lovers be united." Lord Yan and Wen Guizhi were not quite lovers, but later, it was said that they could not grow old together. Wen Guizhi still left. What was the reason for this? In the first few years, it was still good. Wen Guizhi had a younger sister named Wen Guifang. Lord Yan even acted as a matchmaker and sent her to a noble in Beijing. Later, Wen Guizhi gradually felt unaccustomed to living there. She also felt that Lord Yan's temper was difficult to handle. Originally, there are rules in official residences, especially in the homes of officials. People from brothels are not used to being restrained in that way. Lord Yan was a famous scholar, and once he became an official, he had a kind of unspoken temper. When she felt uncomfortable in her heart, she felt uncomfortable everywhere. At that time, there was only one way to separate. So, in the past, there was a certain famous scholar who married a famous actress. It was good at first, but later it gradually became unbearable. The famous scholar had an analogy, although it was to excuse himself, it was very appropriate. He said that all famous prostitutes and actresses are like a kingfisher with a beautiful voice and beautiful colors. It is best to let them sing, fight and fly freely in the forest. If you keep them in a cage, they will become listless and lifeless, and just die. Marrying a famous prostitute or actress as a concubine is like putting a kingfisher in a cage. At that time, there are only two ways. One way is to lock it to death in the cage. The other way is to open the cage and let the kingfisher fly freely into the forest.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Gold Market Weakens After Financial Opening <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>▲ The entire city only fluctuated by two taels. The gold exchange opened as usual yesterday. The bidding situation was mediocre. The front market only fluctuated by two taels, and the after-market only moved one tael in either direction, hovering around 98 taels. As for the contraction and expansion of foreign exchange, the market was not busy. Fuchang, Yuancheng Yong, and others bought, while Yuan Mao Yong and Xiangyu and others sold. From the morning, because the large silver bars stopped work internally, there was a slight setback. Later, buyers became active and raised the price, but the sellers were also diligent. Bills of exchange tended to be loose and once weakened, but then the banks repeatedly absorbed spot goods, causing them to be pulled up. At noon, it was between 99 taels. In the after-market, Wanxing and Yuancheng Yong advanced slightly, Zhifeng Yong and retail investors sold, and the market atmosphere became more mediocre, and the price also weakened slightly.</p>
<p>▲ The opening price fell by six qian. The recent unified core of British silver bars increased by 1/16, the far-term increased by 1/8, the silver price was reduced by 1/8, and the exchange rate did not change.

After 10 o'clock, it turned higher again, because Datong and other banks bought spot goods at 989 taels, so the price increased by about two taels, and the bills of exchange were also good. June British gold could be sold at 11 pence 375, and Mitsui absorbed Japanese gold at 1 tael 0 fen 4.125. Korea bought far-term at 1 tael 0 fen 3.6875, and around 10:30, it was 8 taels and a half, and then slightly reduced by 45 qian. After 11 o'clock, the buyers were active, so it went up another tael. At noon, it was 99 taels, and the closing price was 8 taels 9 qian. The posted price was still calculated at 508 taels 8 qian, with a small deduction of 10 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Down a little less than one tael compared to before the closure. The opening price in the after-market was 98 taels 9 qian, and then there were only fluctuations of 12 qian. Suddenly, the Indian exchange rate was greatly reduced, and people's hearts were frustrated, so the price dropped by one tael. The bill of exchange was still flat. HSBC bought far-term Japanese gold at 1 tael 0 fen 3.6875, and then it weakened, and it was difficult to sell at 1 tael 0 fen 3.625.

Later, Japanese gold in August could be sold at 1 tael 0 fen 3.625, and retail investors and hedgers bought in, so it returned to 56 qian, at 8 taels 34 qian. After 3:30, it was reduced by a small 34 qian, but the market was extremely flat, and there were no large tickets for supply on the table. The closing price at 4:30 was 498 taels and 1 qian, which was one tael lower than four days ago (17th).</p>

<p>▲ The Dalian Gang Sold Recent Dalian Tickets</p>
<p>All banks were open for business yesterday. There were no telegrams for the British and Indian silver markets, and the American silver market remained unchanged. There was no honor or disgrace in the overseas telegrams from Yokohama and Kobe. The market situation was extremely mediocre. The foreign exchange posted by HSBC was no different from last Thursday. As for the internal market of banks in this port, it was slightly weak, but there was nothing particularly good or bad. In the end, it was similar to the British gold on the 17th. The American gold increased by .0625, and the Japanese gold decreased by .125, so the bidding price tended to be low. However, it was only about 2 taels, and Chinese merchants and speculators generally sold. A total of 100,000 pounds of British gold was sold, which was taken in by Mitsui, Huabi, and Maixing, and various banks mutually made tens of thousands of pounds, and more than 100,000 yuan of American gold was also made.

<p>The banks were closed for several days and opened yesterday. The receipts and disbursements of these four days were processed in one day, so the amount of inflows and outflows was rare.

<p>▲ Recent Fierce Competition Between the Two Sides</p>
<p>▲ Busy Receiving and Delivering Goods</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm. The overseas cotton yarn market is tending to decline, so people's hearts are softening, and retail investors are tired of watching. However, new sellers are lacking in short positions due to the low base. The business in the market is quiet, and the market fluctuates slightly. Although the sellers are trying to collect spot yarn, the buyers are also preparing to receive a large amount of goods, so the market is stable and there is no major change. It is said that Dafeng and short sellers are about to deliver about 10,000 bales, and it is said that a certain manufacturer is also preparing to receive 10,000 bales. It can be seen that the two sides are competing fiercely.</p>
<p>▲ Short Position Squeezed in the Futures Yarn Market, Atmosphere Suddenly Tightens. The pre-market opening was still weak, and because it was rumored that the short side was preparing to deliver a large number of goods, the atmosphere was slightly weak, falling by two or three qian. The auction was slightly flat until the far month, and then went to the two or three disk. The No. 66 short side was squeezed in the near month, and the market atmosphere suddenly tightened. As a result, each month rose by one or two qian. In the afternoon, the market for this month was even tighter, and No. 66 was still offsetting, and No. 70 also bought in May and June futures, and each month rose by 1.2.3.4.5 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 7,250 bales. The closing price of the person standard is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Person Standard Closing Price Change Storage Amount Closing Price Change Storage Amount</p>
<p>April 1528 Up 8 31,500 July 1527 Up 3 26,000</p>

<p>June 1525 Up 1 37,850 September 1534 Up 2 8,450</p>
<p>▲ Spot Sales Turn Prosperous. The path of spot yarn is still good. Each gang bought 1,300 bales, and 400 bales were purchased by the industry. Among the foreign gangs, the Guangdong gang bought the most, accounting for 290 bales. In addition, Tianjin entered 130 bales, Sichuan entered 250 bales, Niuzhuang entered 150 bales, the interior entered 125 bales, Qingdao entered 110 bales, Xuzhou entered 40 bales, Jiangxi entered 70 bales, and miscellaneous gangs entered 80 bales.</p>

<p>▲ Shanghai Stocks Shallow. Japanese Merchants Squeeze Shorts in the Near Term</p>
<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. US cotton telegrams tended to fall, but domestic cotton did not follow. Because the underlying goods were thin and the source of each road was declining, Japanese merchants squeezed the shorts in this month, tightening and not letting go. The newspaper recorded that the recent month rose, and the far month was also affected. The cotton market was more expensive than the yarn market, and the future is still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>▲ The difference between near and far futures for cotton is about two taels. At the opening of the Han Standard pre-market, it was tired along with the foreign cotton, and retail investors closed out. However, this month was tight and rose alone by one qian, and the far month fell by five cents. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere was very hard, and each rose by five cents to one and a half qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 27,500 dan.

Yesterday, US cotton was initially strong due to statistical reports that favored the buying side, but later it was tired due to multiple closures and poor current needs. The futures fell 15 to 20 days in pounds, and the spot goods fell 20 pounds. The British and Indian cotton markets were closed, and the original telegram was recorded on the left (21st electric).</p>

<h3 id="e205">Grain and Rice Market Calm in the Rain <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, it rained suddenly, the supply was extremely scarce, and sales in this street were very weak. The price of white japonica rice was slightly stable. Buyers had difficulty opening due to the rain, and the intention to purchase river rice was very calm, with few transactions. Large quantities were finalized. The arrival of Bo Dao rice was particularly low, and sales were not good. Moreover, the cloudy weather made it even quieter. Yang Du and other top-quality rice sales were also slow, and prices were very firm. The market situation for Bai Yuan rice was similar to that of other types of rice. All day long, because it was not easy to move quantities, the prices of all rice were generally stable.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai South: There were still few boats arriving from the river. The market atmosphere for northern japonica rice was quite dull. Shops and stalls also paused due to the rain. Although a small number of scattered purchases of Zhong Ci, Tong Li, and other machine-milled japonica rice were made, the market price could not be greatly increased. However, the porters and customers, because it was usually popular, and there was news of a ban on exports, called for higher prices, but buyers were sluggish, and it was not easy to get their wish. There were very few customers for southern Bo Dao rice, and the price was stable and weak. There were not many sources of Yang You Bian Yuan and other types of rice, and the inventory was not thick. The market was stable.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Futures Trading in Foreign Rice Still Suspended <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>▲ Spot trading weak... Prices stable</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation: Futures trading was suspended due to high prices, too much buying and selling, and disputes arising in the market, and also due to the prohibition discussed by the Social Affairs Bureau. Spot trading was still weak. The total market volume was only about 7,000 (units) handled by domestic buyers in this street, with small grains accounting for two-thirds. The market price remained stable. Although buyers were pressing prices due to weak sales, sellers were unwilling to sell cheaply due to high prices in the producing areas. Therefore, No. 1 Saigon rice was still priced at 16 yuan, small grains at 15 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 fen, and Qie La rough rice at 14 yuan, 9 jiao and 3 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Bulls Sell Off, Flour Market Weakens <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a pattern of near-term weakness and long-term stability for all months. This month, due to sluggish actual sales and many outside players holding surplus inventory, everyone was engaged in selling off, so it was sluggish. Although a certain factory had a large number of pre-drawn warehouse receipts that had not been settled, the environment was such that it could not be sustained. The opportunity for speculative trading seemed to be limited. As for May and subsequent months, there was a slight recovery in the morning trading because the rain caused natural market activity. However, when trading opened in the afternoon, it gradually weakened again because the intentions of a certain factory and domestic buyers were not as firm as before, and news from wheat seedlings in various places generally reported abundant and beautiful crops. The previous week's heavy rain had no significant impact. Therefore, those selling off from the long side were quite active, and the market was less firm than in the morning. As a result, this month was down 7.5 li compared to the previous day, May was down 5 li, and June to September had no change.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Wheat Market Lacks Vitality <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market for all months generally showed a pattern of mutual speculation. Only a few truckloads were traded in the morning this month, and no trading occurred in the afternoon because both buyers and sellers were watching and waiting, with no intention to trade. There were slight fluctuations in June, July, and August, but transactions were very smooth. For example, the Xibang traders still had some buying and selling, as it was currently a good opportunity for large players to take profits. As a result, this month and June, July, and August were similar to the previous day, and September was down 1 fen. The spot wheat market also showed signs of stability and weakness. Since flour sales were not smooth, small and medium-sized factories did not dare to boldly purchase goods. Only large factories still had demand, and competition was less, so there was little vitality to speak of. The price of wheat from Kai Nan, Suzhou, and Bengbu was 5 liang and 8 fen, and wheat from Hankou was 4 liang and 8 qian, with a total of more than 3,600 bags offered.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Piece Goods, Civilized Serge, and Ting Cloth Prices Decline Sharply <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Piece goods trading was slightly more active yesterday, as the customs had been closed for several consecutive days, and business resumed as usual yesterday. Therefore, the inventory of goods among traders was largely empty, and coupled with the increased taxes in Zhejiang Province, everyone rushed to replenish their stocks early, so there were many transactions in this street. However, the market was still weak, especially the price of civilized serge and Ting cloth from Donghuo declined most sharply. Yuntongzi was only sold for 1 qian, 6 fen, and 2.5 li, and Sancaizi for 1 qian, 6 fen, and 7.5 li, down another 2.5 to 5 li compared to the previous day. Yuanyang yarn was also sluggish, with Dian Qiuxiang priced at 8 liang and 3 qian and 5 fen, Hanshansi with no stock, and Zijinshan at 8 liang. Only striped silk pongee was firm due to limited stock, with Yang Guifei priced at 3 qian and 7 li, Qing Guan Jing completely sold out, and white crepe was still firm. Fine tweed, Zhigong satin, and Zhigong wool remained unchanged. Among the out-of-town buyers, the Sichuan traders shipped more than 200 pieces yesterday, with Indanthrene fine cloth being particularly popular. Linen serge and Ting cloth were also shipped slightly. Among the Western goods, more than 30 pieces of white striped linen yarn were shipped, with Rende goods at 2 qian and 3 fen and 5 li, Taihe Bian Caihua at 2 qian and 6 fen, and Zhonghe goods at 2 qian and 8 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Silk and Tea Lake Districts' Silkworm Rearing Affected by Banditry <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>As the Grain Rain solar term arrives, farmers in the interior are engaged in hatching silkworm eggs. The old Huzhou prefecture has historically been a well-known silkworm silk region. This year, the lake bandits are rampant, looting everywhere. Farmers rearing silkworms along the lake have discarded the silkworm eggs they had reserved, warning each other not to raise them. Even the number of silkworm eggs hatched by silkworm farmers in Jili and other places has decreased. It is difficult to expect a bumper spring harvest in the Lake district this year.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Overseas Silk Telegrams Do Not Arrive After Christmas <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of reopening after the Christmas holiday closure in this port. All foreign firms had resumed office after the holiday. However, the overseas markets had just passed Christmas, and the silk telegrams had not yet arrived yesterday. Sales of silk by foreign firms remained weak. Yesterday, only Qianli imported 30 bales of Shanghai-produced white silk, and Meida imported 10 bales of white dried silk. The price remained stable.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Wuyuan Green Tea Harvested and Processed Early <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Wuyuan Gao Zhuang green tea, which is most popular in the UK, US, Russia, and France, will soon be on the market. In the past month, tea firms have been preparing to open their businesses, and the atmosphere is very prosperous. However, due to the recent cold weather, the tea buds have been suppressed by the cold, and their growth has slowed down. The local tea industry association issued a notice yesterday, advising mountain farmers to harvest and process the tea early, so as to avoid old tea leaves becoming loose and being disliked by foreigners. However, mountain farmers complained that this year's grain prices have soared, with each dan of tea rice costing 15 yuan, coupled with rising labor and commodity prices. It is expected that future tea prices will not only be lower than in the past but may even have to be raised. Tea firms are facing financial difficulties, and the prices of firewood and charcoal have all risen, so the cost has increased rather than decreased. Therefore, although there are not fewer tea firms in various villages than in the past, the owners are deeply worried about this year's situation.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Fuliang Green Tea Will Be Available Soon <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>In addition to supplying foreign firms with tea leaves for making black tea, Fuliang also sells a considerable amount of green tea to local tea shops each year. This year, the tea trees in the area sprouted quite early due to the warm weather last month. Tea from Naxiang Zhouyuan will be available for harvesting within days. Tea shops in Jingzhen and Raozhou have recently sent personnel to Fuliang to search for purchases, and new tea will be available soon.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Qimen New Black Tea Has Opened the Scales <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Since the 15th, mountain farmers in Qimen have mostly started picking new black tea. Fortunately, the weather has been sunny and the quality of the water is still good. The scales for Ling Shou's pre-rain Bai Hao have been opened, with each dan priced at 140 yuan, similar to last year. However, due to the recent rice shortage in Qimen and the fact that the tea-making workers were unable to come to Qimen for employment due to the Communist bandits attacking the Hekou area, it has been difficult to proceed quickly with harvesting and processing.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Morocco Tea News Not Good <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>French Morocco is the largest market for our country's green tea. The sales of Zhen Mei, Zhu Cha, Xiu Mei, and other varieties from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas have increased from 30,000 to 40,000 boxes to more than 100,000 boxes in the past five or six years. Last year, due to the suspension of sales to Russia, foreign merchants took the opportunity to hoard goods. The import of Chinese tea into Morocco increased by 40,000 to 50,000 boxes compared to the previous year, resulting in full inventories and a sharp drop in tea prices. Many foreign tea merchants suffered losses. Shanghai traders have adopted a negative attitude towards this year's new tea due to the unfavorable news from that market.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Foreign Firms Have More Than 30,000 Boxes of Tea in Stock <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>The major firms in this port, including British firms Xie He, Yi He, and Jinlong, have been slow to ship the Zhen Mei, Zhen Mei, and other green teas they have purchased due to the sluggish tea market in the UK and France. According to current surveys and statistics, the number is no less than 35,000 boxes, of which Zhen Mei accounts for about eight-tenths.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Oil Market: White Brain Recovers After Rising <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The white brain market has not been as prosperous as before in recent years, so prices have not fluctuated for several months, hovering between 90 and 100 taels. Those engaged in this business often neglect it because there are no major ups and downs. However, there have been major changes in the past one or two months. The origin has less supply and arrival volume suddenly reduced, jumping to 120 to 130 taels. Recently, because the price is high, it appears dangerous. For several days, the open prices have been 122 and 123 taels for rice core and 120 taels for general. Only a dozen (units) are in Shanghai, so there is no expectation of a major decline.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Remain Dull and Weak <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market origin telegrams: The current price of Cuban sugar is 1.65625, up 0.03125 compared to the pre-closure price. The price of New York sugar futures for May is 1.60, down 1 point; September is 1.74; December is 1.60, down 1 point; and September is 1.74, down 1 point as well. There are still no telegrams from Java. The market trading in the association market remains quiet. The transaction price for Dutch sugar 24 grade raw white remains at 7 liang, 2 qian, 7 fen, and 5 li, with increased slackness in buying and selling, and the market shape is stable. 20 grade medium white is still relatively popular at 7 liang and 5 fen. Transactions in Japanese sugar are sluggish: Mai is 7 liang and 7 qian, YT Mai is 7 liang and 6 qian, and the market is stable and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Hardware: French Nails Are Exported Vigorously <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The continued customs closure has greatly reduced hardware exports. However, trading was very active yesterday, as various goods were rushed for export. It is estimated that the volume of transactions in one day reached a huge 8,000 to 9,000 dan, with French nails accounting for a particularly large portion. It is estimated that more than 1,600 barrels were shipped to Tianjin, Yantai, Hankou, and other ports. However, after the goods in the market were purchased, they became more consolidated, and standard secret prices were repeatedly increased. The current market price for general colors is 6 liang and 6 qian, and single hook prices are no less than 6 liang and 7 qian and 5 fen. It is said that domestic production has been very weak recently, creating an opportunity for imported goods to sell well.</p>

<h3 id="e222">The 514 Feixia New Car: Yellow Shadow Stays... <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>▲ Countless Amazing Achievements</p>
<p>If we look back over the past ten years, every new car produced by the Feixia Factory has been welcomed by society. For this reason, the sales of various Feixia vehicles have grown rapidly in recent years. Since the new cars of previous years have achieved such excellent results, it can be asserted that the new car produced this year will certainly not have any shortcomings. Since the end of the Great War, the Feixia Car Factory has launched the 501 new car on the market. Following the 501, the 94-horsepower 509 new car was launched. Almost everyone in the world acknowledges this new car as an excellent product.</p>
<p>▲ Beautiful Body: Take the 514 Feixia new car as an example. The beauty of the body is unprecedented. Although the length of the wheelbase is not much different from that of the 94-horsepower Feixia car, the space inside the car is wider. Even if four people sit in it together, it is unusually comfortable and without the suffering of crowding. The strength of the horsepower is such that, although the UK and other countries have been increasing the tax rate in recent years, the economics of various Feixia new cars have long been evident. The engine of the new car produced this year is also quite large, measuring 143,800. Therefore, the ratio of weight makes people very eager to buy cars. To date, the number of owners who have purchased the 509 new car is countless. Now, the 514 new car is meeting us again. The new car this year is very different from the old car. The construction method is completely different. From the buffer rail to the taillights, the manufacturing process has been carefully studied to ensure that the produced vehicles satisfy modern car owners. Other things, such as the excellent raw materials and low value, are even more important. The advantages of the 514 Feixia new car are analyzed below, which I believe will also be welcomed by the readers of this publication.</p>
<p>The actual horsepower is 11.14, and the maximum can reach 34. It can rotate 3,400 revolutions per minute. There are four cylinders. The cast model is 674,102 CCMM in length. The bore and stroke, cylinders, and crankcase are all connected in one piece. The top is equipped with an excited head cover with 16 solid nails. The crankcase has three obvious and simple bearings to govern the movement of the crank rod. The crank rod has four bearings, which are used to imitate the Morse silent chain. This chain passes through the generator's rod to control the power. All the pistons are equipped with appropriate small dents on one side to act as guides. The water pump, which is installed in the front part of the cylinder, has a rod that comes out of the pulley on the crank rod to control the movement of the water pump. There is an iron fan with four blades on the handle of the water pump. The connecting rods are also connected to each other in one piece. The pistons are made of lead and have three compression rings. The upper part of the cylinder crankcase is also connected in one place. The oil drainer is also made of high-quality steel, so there is no obstruction during operation. There are no accidents when disassembling the piston and connecting rod. In terms of the overall construction method of the Feixia new car, the main bearings, as well as the camshaft bearings, connecting rods, iron chains, and other items, are connected to the crankcase by a gear-type water pump to govern the camshaft. The pressure is quite high, so the convenience of all lubrication is unmatched by any vehicle.</p>
<p>▲ Powerful Electricity: The electrical system is governed by generators, batteries, and coils. The distribution of current is very convenient, and the power generation is also relatively strong. The above-mentioned distributor is placed on top of the cylinder. The spark plugs are installed at an angle. The automatic generator is installed next to the engine, running in parallel. A ring-shaped gear is installed on the left side to block the flywheel. The carburetor is a Solex type, installed next to the piston. The mixture of air is supplied from the exhaust chamber to the intake pipe. In addition, there is a gasoline ejector to make driving more convenient. There is also a common throttle device on the carburetor to help air flow. The installation of the new car is so complete that the gasoline is poured into the oil tank and into the carburetor without any accidents. As for the installation of the oil tank, it can be divided into two parts, which are forged and connected to the flange. It passes through the metal dashboard, and the dashboard has 12 screws nailed into it. The installation and removal are easy. There are rubber materials mixed in to reduce vibration, and the installation of the oil tank also strengthens the dashboard. There is no major explosive force in any environment. Moreover, in the event of a special accident, it is quite convenient to remove it from the engine. A funnel is installed under the flame arrester. In addition, there is a advantage that I would like to tell the readers, that is, a V-shaped convex line is installed under the engine so that gasoline can travel in two channels without exploding. There is a plate under the carburetor. If a fire occurs while driving, this plate can be used to extinguish it in any environment. Therefore, no fire will occur no matter what.</p>
<p>▲ Engine Installation: The engine and chassis are joined in four main places. There are spherical rubbers installed in between to cushion. Two of them are near the engagement part, which is also the most important part of connecting the engine. The other two are in the front, crossing the frame. The simple engagement device is equipped with a circular handle, which is very dry during operation and does not require attention. The gearbox is made of aluminum and has four-part acceleration. It is also screwed to the engagement device. The same is true for other important places. The small gears full of mesh holes make the car run without any noise. In terms of the speed of each part, the speed is 50, 34 and 3/4, 21 and 3/4, 12 and 3/4 miles per hour. When going up or down hills, the slope can also reach one-third. The weight of the propeller shaft is uniform and unparalleled. The connecting head is used to take the power from the gearbox and feed it into the semi-floating rear axle. The ratio of the inclined gears from 5.6 to 1 is spiral. The axle housing is also uniquely designed, with two steel pressure devices running horizontally. The connection with the front is also screwed. The disassembly is convenient, and the hub caps are placed inside.</p>
<p>▲ Semi-Elliptical Springs: The springs installed in each part, regardless of front and rear, are semi-elliptical. As for the hooks and needles, they are all lubricated with the Tecalemit method. The diameter of the four-wheel brakes is quite wide and long, and the brake drums are also made of aluminum. The foot pedals and handrails can be used at will. This type of brake has even more amazing results, and the construction method is completely different from other vehicles. The small nails used are very suitable. There is a total screw nailed to the floor, and at the same time there are four-winged nails tied to the end of each connecting rod to control the brake cam handle. The engine is affected by the fan and heat. Driving on British roads is unprecedentedly stable, fast, and convenient. The foot pedals are of moderate length and can be placed on the left or right. The gear change and brake operation are all very easy. The switch for turning off the headlights is located in front of the driving system and has an electric switch. When starting the car, you only need to step on the foot pedal. The advantages are countless.</p>
<p>▲ Beautiful Appearance: The aluminum heat sink is tall and slightly narrow, which really enhances the beauty of the vehicle. As for its style, it is like a honeycomb, with only inclined iron pipes installed on it. The wheelbase of the 11.14-horsepower Feixia new car is 8 feet, 4 and 3/4 inches. The wheelbase is 4 feet. The length of the body is 6 feet, 6 inches, and the length of the chassis is 11 feet, 6 inches. The flat round wheels are completely made of steel, and the tires are 27 x 4.75. The construction of the body is even more unexpected. The four-door sedan has three lights on each side, and the two-door passenger car has two large windows. As for the factory cars and two-seater convertible sports cars, the seats are unusually comfortable. In a nutshell, the 11.14-horsepower new car is unmatched by any vehicle in terms of beautiful appearance and comfortable driving. It is truly worthy of being the most valuable six-cylinder product of the Feixia Company.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Historical Fragments of Rubber <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Millions of car users are limited in their ability to understand the complexity of tire manufacturing and the difficulty of cultivating rubber trees, especially those who are far from the rubber-producing areas. Recently, Dunlop Rubber Company planted 2 million rubber trees in 16 square miles of land in the Malay Peninsula. It is expected that in ten years, it can reach 5,000 tons of rubber per year. The company currently has about 4 million grown rubber trees, producing 8,500 tons of rubber per year.</p>
<p>The procedure for extracting rubber in the producing area is very complicated. A container is placed under each rubber tree. Every other day, a thin layer of bark is cut to wait for the rubber tree sap to drip. The sap dripping from each tree in one day can only produce half an ounce of dry rubber.</p>
<p>One-third of the farmers who cultivate rubber trees are Chinese, and the rest are natives. The local rubber company built temples and houses for these farmers, established hospitals and schools, and supplied them with cheap rice.</p>
<p>Automobile Pilot</p>
<p>When a ship sails in an unfamiliar waterway, it must hire a so-called pilot to guide its course. Now, pilots have also emerged in the automotive industry, which is a rare coincidence.</p>
<p>In London, foreign tourists often regret the difficulty of driving during traffic jams. Therefore, there are automobile pilots. These people can take responsibility for driving or just point out how to proceed. The fee is five shillings every two hours, which is also a new business.</p>

<p>According to A. Van Der Zee, the general manager of Shuntung Automobile Company, the success of Shuntung Brand automobiles lies in having five features. Today, various improvements to various automobiles all use these five features as manufacturing standards.</p>
<p>▲ The so-called five features are: First, the manufacturing principle is based on the standard quality of Chrysler Automobile Company to ensure reliable performance. Second, it is full size, which is only seen in low-priced cars. Third, it is economical. Fourth, the style is fashionable. Fifth, it is the only low-priced car equipped with new hydraulic brakes, which are resistant to wind and rain and can automatically equalize pressure. Isn't it foolproof?</p>

<p>▲ The Strange Tale of Using Wine Instead of Water In the Ibani region of France, water sources are scarce, but grapes are abundant. As a result, automobile owners often worry about the lack of cooling water. Some insightful individuals have taken a large quantity of grapes and made juice from them, using wine to replace water. They sell it to car owners, taking advantage of this opportunity to do business. Car owners have no choice but to buy it and add it to their dried-up radiators as a supply. The price of wine is about twenty cents a barrel, while water is even more expensive. The area has contracted water vendors who specialize in carrying spring water and selling it to various villages at high prices.</p>
<p>▲ Paris Forbids Hard Rubber Tires Public buses in Paris, the capital of France, are all equipped with hard rubber tires. Therefore, they shake houses and create loud noises when traveling through the city. As a result, the Paris Public Works Bureau has strictly banned them.</p>
<p>▲ Danish Drivers Must Be Insured All automobile and motorcycle drivers in Denmark must pay a certain insurance fee to protect pedestrians. Denmark is said to be the second country to have this type of insurance law after a life insurance provider.</p>
<p>▲ Siamese Car Sales Methods Selling cars in Siam (Thailand) is quite difficult. During the day, people are busy with farming, and at night they are absorbed in theater. The local General Motors branch lacks suitable times to connect with customers and suitable places to negotiate prices, resulting in sluggish sales. They have now improved their methods by using theatrical performances to attract business. They perform publicity for twelve hours every night, and the sales volume of Chevrolets has greatly increased. This type of promotion method can be called an innovation in the world of commerce, and General Motors' advertising can be said to cater most to the psychology of people everywhere.</p>
<p>▲ Newly Invented Automobiles Switzerland and the United States have recently invented a substitute for gasoline. The Swiss invention is derived from charcoal, mostly used for trucks. It is said to be seven times more economical than ordinary gasoline. The American invention is extracted from shale, producing oil of pure and thick quality, refined and durable. It is said to increase horsepower by four times compared to ordinary gasoline.</p>
<p>▲ Spirit of Self-Governance The people of Berlin, the capital of Germany, drive cars without the supervision of traffic police. Everyone has a spirit of self-governance. Anyone who violates the usual laws can be arrested and warned by others who witness it.</p>
<p>▲ Indian Labor Cheaper than Machine Power India has a large population and cheap labor. It only costs ten cents a day to hire someone to carry heavy objects. Although the use of trucks is also widespread, their purpose is for work and economy. It is now rare to hear of human labor being cheaper than machine power.</p>
<p>▲ Germany Facilitates Travelers Those who travel to Germany gather outside major cities upon arrival. There, guides lead them and drive them to visit various scenic spots. This is very safe and saves time. They also provide travelers with driving rules at any time. Hiring such personnel costs little.</p>
<p>▲ Colombo Emphasizes Roadside Scenery According to Colombo's recent plan to reform roadside scenery, it is planned to remove all billboards and other similar posters along the way to beautify the roads and scenery. Government notices and road signs are of course not included in this plan.</p>
<p>▲ Australia Issues Parking Permits According to the parking regulations of Melbourne, all vehicles parked on the roadside must have a parking permit. The price of the permit is twenty-five cents. Before parking, the permit must first be shown to a police officer for inspection. Each permit is valid for the day and expires the next day.</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Exploration Team Uses Automobiles Instead of Camels Automobiles are used extensively, reaching far and wide, unafraid of rain or drought, or ice and snow. They can handle any weight. The Sino-French exploration team organized by China and France in North China and Annam originally planned to use camels to carry all the luggage, but now they are using automobiles instead. The Chinese explorers departed from Peiping (Beijing) last month and are heading to Russian Turkestan, where they will meet with Persian and French explorers.</p>

<h3 id="e227">The Danger Level of Automobiles… Honk… <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Every day we read newspapers, and records of pedestrians being killed by cars are almost too numerous to count. Moreover, as the number of cars increases daily, the number of accidents also increases endlessly. But to only focus on the increase in accidents without considering the number of cars and the volume of traffic is hardly fair to simply condemn cars as dangerous elements.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the British Automobile Association, the number of registered cars in the UK in 1928 was 2,019,167. In that year, the number of car accidents was 111,976, with an index of 55 per thousand. Tracing back to 1918, this index was 81 per thousand, and in 1919 it was 101 per thousand. In the five years leading up to the present, the annual accident index has been approximately 50 to 55 per thousand.</p>
<p>Judging from these numbers, even without considering the annual increase in the number of cars, it can be seen that the number of accidents has decreased rather than increased.</p>
<p>Furthermore, considering the statistics of automobile traffic volume, in a certain location at the same time, the number of cars passing through in 1929 was five times more than in 1923. However, the number of cars only increased threefold in these six years. In other words, if each car traveled 7,000 miles per year six years ago, it now travels 12,000 miles. This means that not only is the number of cars increasing year by year, but the distance they travel is also increasing year by year. With a large number of cars and busy traffic, the chance of accidents is actually easier than several years ago. According to the above statistics, only a decrease in the accident index is seen. From this, it can be proved that the danger level of cars has been decreasing almost every year.</p>

<p>The picture shows Mr. Nash, a renowned leader in the industry, at his desk. The chair is a work of art made of ordinary stone. The bearskin rug under his feet is from Finland. These three items were gifts from the managers selling "Nash" automobiles to Mr. Nash as mementos. Mr. Nash's office furnishings were originally very ordinary, but with these exquisite items, the walls suddenly seem to shine.</p>

<p>▲ China Travel Service announces that Qingdao is located in the south of the Shandong Peninsula, at the end of the Jiaoji Railway.

Preparations are actively underway, and it is expected to officially open at the beginning of next month to facilitate travel.</p>
