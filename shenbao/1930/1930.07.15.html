<p>世界民族運動之糾紛。每起於宗主國對於殖民地民族之歧待。殖民地民族因受種種歧待之苦痛。鬰積旣久。乃起而爲運動之奮鬭。此近來各地民族要求自治要求獨立等問題之所由來也竊謂此不過强有力之國壓迫弱小而然耳。非盡出於歧待種族之觀念也。今日種族間歧待之最甚者。莫如無色種人與有色種人之糾紛。美洲各國。對於亞洲民族之移民問題。僑商入境問題莫不設有種種苛例。嚴爲限制甚或加以拒絕。因之交涉屢起情感愈傷。成爲國際間之大問題。而拉丁民族。今尙未悟。倘此種種族上歧待之心理長此不變。將來鬰積旣久起而爲奮鬭之運動。其糾紛恐亦將不小也。</p>
<p>今日墨西哥電。謂墨政府已通令各屬調查入境華人。是否合法。而於北方邊境。尤爲注意。此事起因。由於各報竭力宣傳謂中國人民違法混入墨境者。不下數萬。黄禍實爲可慮。故欲加以驅逐觀此一事。即可知美洲人民歧待亞洲民族之心理。夫黄禍之說。有識人士。早嗤其妄。而今日墨人猶藉是說。以拒絕華人入境並欲加以驅逐。則其種族之見。深入牢固而不可拔已顯矣美洲人民。對於華人如是。對於其他各有色民族。亦未必不如是。非亦將來世界糾紛之一大原因哉。</p>

<p>（鎭江通信）蘇敎育廳具呈省府　呈本省地方敎費目前困窘情形及通盤籌畫時應注意各點用備擇採、原文云</p>
<p>謹案財政爲庶政之母敎育樹百年之基、凡諸設籌、理宜並顧特敎育事業、有進而無退、故敎育經費必期遞增而無滅爲保障其安定計、尤非實行（敎費獨立）不可是以（增籌敎費及保障其獨立）之文、黨在政網垂爲要典、方今訓政伊始、當以厲行普及敎育爲訓練民衆促成自治之基本工作關於敎費之增籌及獨立之保障二者、自尤宜急亟擘畫力謀貫澈以重要政、而策進行此者財政廳鑒於各縣務之紊亂爰有改革田賦及縣財政計畫之提議、擬從調查統計人手、並將各項附稅收入、按百分比率、重行通盤支配、業經鈞府第三○七次委員會議議决照辦事關整理計政正本淸源、自屬切要之圖至本省地方敎費目前困窘之情形、及通盤計劃時應予注意之各點、明知早在鈞府洞鑒之中維護調劑、毌待贅瀆、而職責所在、默然難安茲謹縷析陳之、用備採擇、</p>
<p>查經費之多寡應視其需要之程度若何、僅就數量而言各縣敎育經費之視其他各項經費、誠不能不謂爲所占稍多、若自敎育事業之需要言之、、則必需設而未設、必需辦而未辦者、尙十居八九、此種供不應求之現象斷非屬廳之虚言例如義敎方面、根據十七年度統計、各縣學齡兒童之就學者、大率爲百分之十五至二十之間其就學兒童最少之縣分乃僅占百分之四如此每縣中大多數已學齡之兒童徒以義敎未能遂年推廣之故、坐使無法就學喪失其爲健全國民之基礎、事之可痛孰甚於斯、至於社敎事業方在萌芽、百端待舉尤無俟贅、以不識字人數占百分之八十之我國、文化低落、實爲可驚唯一方法端頼義社敎育之實施、以爲逐漸提高之計、本年全國敎育會議議决義敎二十年社敎六年完成之計劃、良爲有見於此則現有義社敎育之實施、其爲不足供最小限度之需要、已屬明甚其他普通敎育之情况、亦復類是、故各縣敎育經費就其需要衡之、實尙居於最少數况綜計現有縣敎費之來源、爲忙漕附稅、忙漕帶征普及畝捐、敎育畝捐等數項大率出内農田比年以來匪患年荒秋成大絀、實征所得較額定之數相差甚遠、義敎畝捐原案、定遞增至一角六分現在各縣普通征至八分、少者僅征四分逐年遞增辦法、迄難實現、是此最少數額定之敎費固亦已如告朔之　羊、有名不副實之歎邪自去年屬廳成立、以迄於今縣敎育經費之支絀狀况、幾於無日不在風雨飄搖之中、索薪頻聞敎潮迭起、以今日之猶在敎費獨立制度之下基礎較爲鞏固牽動較爲不易、而現狀之困難已至於此、假令一旦制度變更糾紛勢將益甚恐財政未收整理之效、而敎育已届破産之時、此猶屬廳之所以不敢不致其鰓鰓之慮者也、茲經再三考慮管見所及於整理財政辦法中、似有應請先予决定者數事、期於財廳主張不相背謬、而敎育現狀亦得暫謀維持、謹再條舉如左、</p>
<p>一、各縣敎費、無論其占全縣經費總數百分之幾、均須以保持各該縣原有之數爲最低限度也、查地方敎育大部分爲小學小學敎師任務之勞、待遇之薄爲人所共知、屬廳綜核現狀怒焉憂之、徒以限於財政遂使改善無從、力絀心餘徬徨太息、不得已釐定小學敎育經費支配標準、其主旨固以敎費來源不易應力持撙節、補加效率、同時亦意在節滅浮費、穏定薪給使小學敎師、於此最低限度以内得謀生活之穏定以視從前欠薪累月、日呼庚癸者庶幾此善於彼至小學經費自經屬廳此次釐定之後、業已浮濫盡删無可再減、倘於此時而全縣敎費總數忽有折減之事則旣無浮費可删復無餘欵可挹、勢必須停辦已辦之各級學校及社敎機關若干、而後收支乃能適合是不特使全省敎育界、頓限於恐慌之景象、抑將使全省少數已就學之兒童亦歸失學多數有職業之敎師、忽成失業末流所至有非屬廳所忍言者此應請注意者一、</p>
<p>一、敎育預算仍應另行編造不能與地方其他預算相混也查蘇省省敎育經費於距今五六年以后早經獨立設處管理、縣敎育經費之單獨編造預算亦經鈞府議决、令飭遵行、凡此敎費獨立已具之規模似有力謀保存之必要、用以上副政綱下符定案今者各縣十八年度敎育預算、業已遵令造齊、十九年度循案辦理順理成章困難自少即爲編造各縣全縣預算計似亦可收相得益彰之效此應請注意者二、</p>
<p>一、敎費應劉分保管、不得任由縣長或財局長務擅行挪用以杜侵　也查敎育畝捐之保管早經訂有專章、限制綦嚴、而各縣征收機關悍然不顧、擅行挪用大宗畝捐、以及其他敎育稅欵者尙復層見疊出、不克縷舉無論因公因私、一經發覺、究詰無從嚴令押追者有之、責令後任淸償者有之、即使追到償淸而敎費已受其紊亂之害况乎其或未能最近屬廳咨請財政廳設法追繳之案尙不下數起、其明證也、倘使嗣後凡諸敎育專欵一律歸入通盤支配則限制旣已撤消挪移自更任便、懲前瑟後、自不得不請嚴定界限、仍沿專欵辦法劃分保管藉資保障此應請注意者三、</p>
<p>一、各縣原有積存敎育基金仍應專欵存儲不得藉詞動用也、查敎育經費之絀縮艱窘、業經罄述無遺、顧在一般觀察或尙以爲敎費預算列有提取基金及第一第二預備金等辦法、各縣亦必須遵照規定成數提列、是敎費雖絀固尙有餘裕以爲未雨之綢繆、當不如所言之甚、不知基金一項乃以備敎育事業適應需要逐年擴充之用亦如經臨等費之必不可缺、至於預備金率以抵秋勘核减之數、以免預算發生虚收實支之弊事實上並無收入之可言但恐通盤支配之令甫下不知者眩於基金預備金等等名目羣起紛爭以嘗鼎一　爲快、其本非實收者、可置不議、若僅存之敎育基金即悉捐此區區、無甚補於他項行政收入、而有害之敎育前途至巨、竊期期以爲不可、此應請注意者四、</p>
<p>以上四者、均爲維持江蘇地方敎育切要問題、本普通之原則應事實之要求、於力謀整理財政之中、庽穏定敎育現狀之意、以期仰副鈞府重視訓政基本工作之本旨、用敢不避繁瑣、據實直陳、是否有當、祇候核奪、迅予施行實、爲公便謹呈江蘇省政府委員會江蘇省敎育廳廳長陳銑、</p>

<p>巿長訓詞由岑德彰代表致詞、略謂有人以爲已得到相當程度奚用再進暑期學校、此實錯誤、敎育爲使吾人能適應還境增高能力、環境時時有變遷敎育亦然、小學敎師平時功課忙、苦無充分研究的時間、暑校正予諸君以研究之機會、敎育行政當局之辦暑期學校、對於諸君是一種貢獻豈僅爲敎師應參加而已、昔有一學者長某校、暇時恒赴各敎員室中觀其桌上之書常易而有益否否則學期旣終、不再續聘、即因其不隨時求進也、學無止境、任敎師者、更須無止境的前進、</p>
<p>講師致詞（一）方賓觀謂人文進化、即基於社會時時有變遷、若彼進而我不進便成落伍關於注音符號第一次爲國音檢字、第二次爲京音安母均未成功、第三次爲民國二年之國音字　到七年由敎育部正式宣傅以京音爲準、各地人不能習慣、與社會上情感不治、遂有今年注音安母之改進、昔之國音字母爲先統一讀音而後普及敎育、現在是於普及敎育中寓統一讀音、關於國音問題已經過數次改進吾人未能再落伍了、注意符號、目下尙無調查各省國音大約至遲年底可畢事云云、（二）江問漁略謂個人對於暑期學校有一點感想、在未設新式敎育前本無所謂暑假、僅有年假、或鄉村農忙時之忙假、現在學校有暑假、又有暑期學校似乎矛盾、實不矛盾昔之私塾簡單現在學校複雜、行政方面應有結束并籌備將來事項、學生方面亦應使身心有相當的休息或工作、故暑假非無故而放也、而且對於爲敎員者亦予以知識能力補充之時機、小學敎師尤甚、雖云平時一方敎、一方學與做、但總是出多入少、時時須有新的知識技能應需要故暑期學校爲小學敎師最有稗益者也暑期學校種類甚多、然爲適應需要則一、或爲升學、或爲研究某事、小學敎師則在研究新方法新理論以應需求、其次便是增加工作效能、受了暑校的訓練得到新的技能、則工作效力自然增加再次便是希望職業的改進、職業爲人生的一大部份、敎師爲國家基礎、能時時改進才好、希望諸位認識暑校之爲用、謹以職業的改進爲祝、</p>

<p>相良　卡那凡洛　六○四六一</p>
<p>勝　一一一一一</p>
<p>松尾　塔佛爾斯　四六六四六</p>
<p>葡萄牙之卡那凡洛與塔佛爾斯爲去年上海雙打冠軍、配搭有素、球藝頗精明治之相良與松尾、亦甚聯絡、作戰十分努力、始終不懈開賽後、卡塔二人小心作戰、形勢頗佳卡那凡洛之攔網與高壓尤見得手、相良松尾努力對抗曾戰至四比四之平局、第一盤之勝利、卒歸卡塔比數爲六比四第二盤卡塔二人頓現疏忽頻頻失分、相良松尾常在底線外用高球還擊遇有機會、則猛力進攻、二人竟連得六局、以六比零全勝、第三局相良松尾又乘對方之疏忽、以六比四勝、卡塔二人見勢不妙、乃急起直追、亦以六比四勝回第四盤、比數各二、遂作第五盤之决戰、葡之塔佛爾斯性情暴燥、不忠於事幾乎無心變戰、終被相良松尾以六比一勝造成三比二之結果裁判員林寶華、</p>

<p>小松勝日柯拉沙……二比一</p>
<p>單打第一組葡隊Ｈ柯拉沙對明治小松二人作戰、俱頗小心惟柯氏於第三盤中、失分過多而致敗北殊爲可惜第一盤柯氏球勢極順隨心所欲無不奏效、以六比零全勝、第二盤起小松先勝兩局柯氏追上兩局、小松又獲二局柯氏亡命進攻僅取得一局、結果小松以六比四勝、第三盤形勢吃緊、小松得勝第一局後、節節失利柯拉洲聲東擊西使小松抬架爲難造成四與一之比柯氏占勝、至此柯拉沙大有獲勝希望、不料以後頻頻失分、加以小松穏健之抽球、柯氏一落千丈結果小松又以六比四勝、裁判員拉斯謨生、</p>

<p>松尾勝塔佛爾斯……二比一</p>
<p>第一組單打爲松尾（明治對塔佛爾斯（葡）人各在雙打賽中劇戰五盤精力略减然猶不肯示弱竸爭亦頗激烈、塔佛爾斯平心靜氣、努力奮鬥、以六比四勝第一盤第二盤起塔氏又發火性心手不能相應、僅在第四局時取得一局結果以一比六敗、第三盤起初相提並進、各得兩局、而後松尾節節勝利、塔佛爾斯無心再戰一失再失、松尾又以六比一勝第三盤裁判員馬德泰、</p>

<p>（七）大阪美人座</p>
<p>神户至大阪。火車一小時可逹大阪爲日本六大都巿之一六大都巿者即東京大阪京都神户名古屋横賓是。而大阪尤爲工商業之中心凡日本之最大工業製造廠及紡織廠等均集中於斯。故商務之盛。甲於日本。全府人口爲三百三十五萬七千六百人居全國第二位全球第六位。最多爲東。京蓋有四百九十八萬二千二百人（根據去年日本統計局報告）大阪街巿寛大淸潔。建築宏高偉麗。閙巿中車馬如水行人如織。記者抵大阪時已近黄昏。未幾萬家燈火電光照耀。紅綠電流廣告。到處皆是。交通較滬上尤爲便利電車四通八逹。稍遠可乘長途電車毎二分鐘一次。汽車亦沿途可僱。巿内勿論遠近。每次日金一圓。故街巿間汽車最多。警察維持交通極感困難。車站前擁擠尤甚由著名警察某氏常駐該處。負指揮交通責任。某氏行動類如瘋顚手舞足蹈。無片刻休息呼止則止。喝行則行。秩序井然駐足圍觀者甚衆○記者亦小立數分鐘甚偑其任事之勇也。大阪與東京間火車十二小時可逹去年四月一日起由日本航空輸送株式會社創辦京阪郵航。每晨飛航一次。載送旅客郵件。二小時可到民衆。稱便。乘價單程爲日金三十圓。與火車頭等價目相差無幾。故營業十分發逹大阪各種娛樂塲所。應有盡有。而以美人座最爲流行。美人座者爲一種咖啡室之變相。以極美麗之妙齡女子充招待。備有茶酒等各種飲食。營業時間由晚九時起至二時止記者偕曾君衍華一度觀光。門首立三數男僕客人高聲呼請進。職務與長三中龜奴相似。室中佈置。幽雅宜人編竹爲架。上覆紙製之花葉。形狀逼眞。復以綠色小電燈點綴其間益形富麗。中央有一小台亦有佈景。台角置無線電放送跳舞音樂。但不能眞個携手共舞耳女招待十數。裝朿艷麗面部厚敷宮粉。欵欵小語。客至。即趨前陪座殷勤招待。温語深情中人欲醉食事大抵啤酒數瓶扁豆一碟。而價乃奇昂。甚有流連數小時。不忍言去者。蓋醉翁之意不在酒也日本女子均極馴服事丈夫如第二父母。絲毫不敢反抗。酒色徵逐。視爲當然更不敢過問。故美人座之營業愈益發逹。經數次之枉顧。便成稔客。再以衣飾等事博其歡心。則銷魂眞。個殊爲易事。日人沉迷於美人座者不知凡幾。廢時失業爲禍最烈。美人座爲大阪特産。最近始有在東京銀座創業者。開巿之日。户限爲穿。預料數月之後。繁盛當不减大阪。日本美人座事業。殆猶方與未艾也。</p>
<p>或否。以奇貨自居云。</p>
<p>南洋之西貢。有動物園絕大其間鳥獸水族。搜羅宏富。尤多奇異之物。有一龜。甲爲三角形。前一角當首部。下兩角當兩後足。其他則與常龜同又有一物。似龜似獸。碩大無朋。遠視若一汽車。近視之則背有甲若龜。頭足亦有似處。此爲友人吳君在西貢所見。歸爲余言之。</p>
<p>吾常天寗寺中有放生池。所放者龜也聚居千百頭。僧人日予食兩次。當給食時。龜本匿水底。祇須鼓掌數下。羣龜聞聲。爭出水面。昂首視人。萬頭顫動。蔚爲奇觀。所予之食。爲麩皮。取以撒水面。彼輩即爭食類西湖玉泉之戲五色大魚也。食畢仍沉落。頃刻不見矣。有游寺者。至此欲覩羣龜。亦祇須鼓掌。即可得見。龜聞聲而知食。靈物。。也然有時不免爲人。弄則又似人之聰明自誤矣</p>
<p>聞吳門有某甲。以連遭不幸。。堪與家謂其父邱墓之風水不佳有以致之。乃擇地營遷。墓發。見棺下蓄水若盆。兩龜作金黄色。並棲水中。縮頭與足。若鴛鴦之酣睡者。甲曰。此龜地也。他日必能福我今則尙非其時也急入棺掩之。完整如故及後。甲益不利。。人謂地氣已洩。故不騐矣。此皆迷信之談。聞之足笑。然兩龜之匿棺底實不知其何由而入。何親此爲樂土也。則亦異矣</p>

<p>第十二回别宴離筵拈花留倩影　名園嘉會鬭茗覩芳姿</p>
<p>左詩晨趕快把日常公事辦妥當了。一回兒馬車也叫來了。他同龍紫耘兩人。便到味蒓園來時候已經在七點多鐘馬路上的電燈都亮。當然園裏裝飾的電燈。也都燦爛通明了。這個時候。游客略爲少一點。因爲這是一個吃夜飯時候。有許多游客。都預備吃好了夜飯纔來。到了八點至九點的時候正是上巿的當兒。所以園中執事。也在那裏論流喫飯。住得近的。便回到家中吃飯。吃了飯再來。原來上海的租界。在東區稱之爲商業區在西區稱之爲住宅區。在靜安寺一帶。很有幾家鉅大的公館。就是上面所說園主人所認識的某宮保等。也就住在相近。這個萬國園游會。那位宮保太太也大賣其力便是那個種福券的獎品彩件。也出自宮保太太奩中。及由伊去勸募而來的。本來伊是一位海上著名的女慈善家。伊又皈依佛敎。如杭州常州上海等處。施捨僧衆起建佛殿的錢。也布施了不少。不在區區之數那宮保的少爺。也有六七位。小姐也有好幾位今天這個慈善會。那幾位小姐都要出勤了三小姐四小姐將近出閣。六小姐七小姐尙在垂髫。一個個都是瓊閨麗質。瑤島仙葩。便是他們親戚�</p>
<p>中的姊妹們。也是不少。都在這個會中來盡幾天義務。且說左詩晨和龍紫耘兩人進了味蒓園大有如入山陰道上令人應接不暇之勢。左詩晨道我們要定一個方針。先到那裏。後到那裏。龍紫耘道。我們先各處轉了一轉看了一個大略。然後便去醫肚皮。趁着這時候游客還少。只是我們在那裏去吃夜飯是一個問題。非得划算一下子不可。爲經濟起見。須得避熟就生。這就應着一句話。喚做（熟皂隸打重板子）了。至於吃了夜飯以後。再如何的游玩。在吃夜飯時候。可以决定。左詩晨說道。很好我們的大政方針定了以後。足供一夜的盤桓了。進門的時候。幾位小姑娘包圍起來賣鈕子花是你所逃不脫的。而且也無理可喻的。進門以後。隨使各處走去。只見一個地方。寫着鈞魚游戲四個字。龍紫耘就動了好奇心。說怎樣叫做鈞魚游戲。我們進去看看。誰知剛剛在門口張了一張。便被裏面的人瞥見了。說道龍先生嗎。進來進來。龍紫耘和左詩晨只得走進去了。</p>

<p>山本鼎著　陳抱一譯（一）</p>
<p>關於農民美術（LArtRustique）則在英國·法國·德國·俄羅斯·意大利等處雖有若干書籍出版但如一般美術那樣、總體的史的記述底一種東西似乎還不見有大槪僅從土俗研究的立塲或從産業視察的立塲介紹出來的</p>
<p>據人類學者的考證則農民美術的起源旣遠在十一二世紀在爲上古西半球之文化中心地的瑞典底北方農村民之間、曾見顯著的發達（請參照足立氏的（瑞典的農民美術）雖然一口稱爲農民美術但却不止限於農民便在漁者牧人之間也曾見有同樣的手工藝流傳着的不過奥大利高原地方的牧人所作的木彫品及嵌木細工則在土俗研究者之間稱爲LArtPastoral（牧人工藝）總之可以見得往昔凡有人住在的地方多少也有所謂農民美術行着的便是遠古的時候一切生活的必需品都是自給的、當未曾有專門工人商店也没有的時代、室内器具及裝身具等都是人人自己製作的、即在今日與遠古同樣的辟隱之地、也仍然行着一切自給的例如吾國（日本）則臺灣的蕃地便是這樣原來自從他們成了日本的籍民物品可用錢買得之後他們的LArtRustique都差不多滅亡了然而即現在他們所居住的房子、像房子的總柱子那樣的祖仙像儀式時穿用的華美的衣裳鞘及柄上刻有浮彫的武器和二人飲用的酒杯竹做的口琴、藤製的帽子素燒的水甕等物都是蕃社的作品吾們對於這種自用的工藝品、在分類上稱爲（自用工藝）</p>
<p>往昔的農民美術一切都是自用工藝雖不能說所有的東西都是由使用者自己一雙手所做成的然總之見得指那種凡在鄕間走重的是在寒村的一人一家、一村落一鄕土的自給的裝飾工藝是稱爲ＬArtRustique的就似乎不錯了、這種農民美術中要算斯干狄納維亞（Scandinavia）爲最富於物例如織成條紋或畫模樣的手織的大壁帷刻着蔓草狀紋樣的浮彫的大家具用粗線刺繡花卉的美麗的墊褥及胴衣等俱是秀絕而獨特的東西、</p>
<p>瑞士的農民美術其有特色的第一印象首先可從建築上感到屋頂上多載圓石的亞爾伯山地的農家（ChaletorDwellings)即在屋頂室裏屋檐窗櫃等處都有浮彫飾着的瑞士的特色大槪是木工及木彫如衣櫃搖籃雪車椅子、桌子木製時辰鐘等這種俱是整個的美術工藝品遠離人里在山上過活的牧人恐怕現在還是像古人一樣自己製作着自己的用品吧</p>
<p>在一本書裏記着……（牧人並不僅是牧夫乃是一種手作人是木匠是美術家、他們雖不拿筆而却是拿小刀的美術家、是創造者、是Altist就中是彫刻家、筆紙不是他們的東西然小刀是常與他們相伴隨、｜｜他們用小刀來刻出他們的想像於瑞士石松或落葉松的木片上人的形狀、野生或飼育的家畜、及其他的生物花草在他們却是天然自然的模特兒）云云、金銀綫剌繡的東西、爲比國的農民美術上著名的手織物乃山村婦人冬期間的快樂的工作、</p>
<p>[雪下起來連續一兩星期都吹着烈風雪那時有凄凉的寒夜重厚的雪阻止了行人的影跡埋没了美麗的村家於全白之中在屋内於手製的檯毯上排放着自製的乾乳酪快樂的一家團欒的晚餐完了婦女們便於長寒夜裏忻忻然拿出紡錘和綫車、從浮彫的小箱裏取出織花邊的針棒、或在燈下攤排着剌繡用具或坐到窗旁的織機上、自遠昔的祖母們所傳下來的用熟了的梭便意勢揚揚地穿插起綫來、</p>
<p>看哪織機具　咚咚咖拉哩</p>
<p>作生活的娘子　連神色都高興</p>
<p>且作且唱的歌聲從各家各户漂漏</p>
<p>出來、｜｜又於夏間牧塲工作間中</p>
<p>、從草木抄描得來的花樣被翻開着</p>
<p>、彩綫的綾便在美麗的布上描運起</p>
<p>來、</p>
<p>在這樣的寒冬情景裏、他們的裝飾工藝也就此告成了、</p>
<p>意大利農民美術也曾見昌盛、敲鑿出畫成紋樣的金銀細工用靑色黄色塗彩的素燒陶器剌繡花邊手織物木工品等頗豐富、</p>

<p>The Vanguard of the Central Army Breaks Through Qufu</p>
<p>The Jin Army's Encirclement of Qucheng is Broken</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military News: The elite forces of the Central Army are concentrated on both the Jinpu and Longhai railway lines, with troop strength more than double that of the rebel army.  Fierce fighting has been ongoing for days on the Jinpu line between our army and the rebel forces. Jinan can be captured imminently. (Special Dispatch, 14th Day)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Railway News: The Central Army on the Jinpu line, through a flanking maneuver, has broken through Qufu and reached Nanyi.  The remnants of the enemy forces in the vicinity of Qufu and Yanzhou have already been eliminated. (Special Dispatch, 13th Day)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Guide, 14th Day Telegram: Zhang Zhuan returns to Nanjing. The air force is commanded by Huang Bingheng, leading air squadrons daily to the Jinan area for reconnaissance and bombing. (Special Dispatch, 14th Day)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Headquarters supplementarily issues a large quantity of military supplies to Liu Zhennian's troops, to be transported to Yantai for reserve use. (Special Dispatch, 14th Day)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government announces: (1) Received a telegram from Chen Cheng, Commander of the 11th Division, stating that Yan Xishan, the rebel and traitor, is guilty of ruining the country, a crime that cannot be pardoned. The Central Government has shown great leniency, repeatedly urging him to awaken. However, the rebel persists in his evil ways, sending troops to invade southward. Since this date, they have been besieging the city of Qufu, engaging in fierce battles with the 13th Division's defending troops for seven days and nights. The rebel enemy concentrated artillery fire and hand grenades, attacking Qufu City.  In the Qufu area, it is estimated that over 8,000 enemy artillery shells and countless hand grenades have fallen.  The military and civilians in the city have suffered heavy casualties, and civilian houses have been completely destroyed. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of our 13th Division were loyal, brave, steadfast, and resolutely defended the city walls, killing countless enemies. The enemy was unable to succeed.  The commander's division, ordered to reinforce, arrived in time, broke the enemy besieging the city, and, in conjunction with the defending troops, attacked from both inside and outside, completely defeating the enemy at dawn and eliminating half of them. The siege of Qufu has been lifted. It is found that Qufu is a famous scenic area in China. Yan, the rebel, has a reputation for respecting Confucius and falsely advocates the doctrine of courtesy and yielding. However, as a result of his conspiracy, the most famous Confucius Forest and Temple have been completely destroyed. The lives, property, and houses of the people have suffered immense losses. Yan, the rebel, is truly to blame for the tragedy of the war. However, the wounds of war are severe, and the scene is desolate. Treating the wounded and rescuing the dying are urgent.  In addition to the commander's division convening local agencies and legal entities to immediately organize the Qufu Post-War Relief Committee to conduct investigations and find ways to handle the aftermath, this telegram earnestly requests the approval of your government to be mindful of the disaster-stricken people and first send a telegram of consolation, and quickly dispatch personnel to find ways to provide relief, so that the people will be grateful, which will also benefit the party and the nation. (2) A telegram from the Qufu County Government, Party Headquarters, Chamber of Commerce, and Confucian Society, stating that on July 1, the battle of Qufu raged for ten days and nights. The rebel army fired approximately 8,000 artillery shells into the city. The northeastern city walls were completely destroyed, and countless residential houses collapsed. Corpses lay in the streets and alleys, and efforts are being made to bury them. The cries of widows and children are unbearable to hear, and the sight of severed heads and broken limbs is horrifying. The Confucius Forest and Temple, the Han tripods and Jin steles, and decades of sacred relics and cultural artifacts were destroyed by artillery fire.  The sight is heartbreaking and evokes righteous anger.  This telegram presents the true situation of the battle for your review and approval.  We earnestly request that funds be allocated and relief efforts be promptly arranged. We await your orders with the utmost urgency.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Mexico Investigates Chinese Entering the Country <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Disputes arising from ethnic movements in the world often stem from the discrimination by colonial powers against the peoples of their colonies. The colonial peoples, suffering from various forms of discrimination, accumulate grievances over time and rise up in movements of resistance. This is the origin of recent demands for autonomy and independence in various regions. It is my opinion that this is merely the result of powerful countries oppressing the weak, rather than solely arising from notions of racial discrimination. Today, the most severe form of racial discrimination is the conflict between the non-colored races and the colored races. Countries in the Americas have various harsh regulations regarding the immigration of Asian peoples and the entry of overseas merchants, imposing strict restrictions or even outright refusal. Consequently, diplomatic disputes frequently arise, emotions are increasingly strained, and the issue becomes a major international problem. However, the Latin nations have yet to realize this. If such racial discrimination persists unchanged, the accumulated grievances will eventually lead to movements of resistance, and the resulting disputes may be significant.</p>
<p>Today's telegram from Mexico states that the Mexican government has issued orders to all its jurisdictions to investigate whether Chinese entering the country are doing so legally, paying particular attention to the northern border region. This matter arose from relentless propaganda by various newspapers, claiming that tens of thousands of Chinese people are illegally entering Mexico, posing a significant "Yellow Peril." Therefore, the authorities seek to expel them. From this incident, it is clear that the people of the Americas hold discriminatory attitudes towards Asian peoples. The notion of the "Yellow Peril" has long been dismissed as absurd by informed individuals. However, the Mexicans today still use this argument to refuse the entry of Chinese and seek to expel them, indicating that their racial biases are deeply entrenched and cannot be easily eradicated. If the American people treat the Chinese in this manner, they may treat other colored peoples similarly. Is this not a major cause of future world conflicts?</p>

<p>Internal Circular Orders Investigation by All Departments</p>
<p>The Public Opinion World Actually Sees it as the Yellow Peril</p>
<p>Associated Press, Mexico City, 13th - According to reliable sources, the Mexican Ministry of Interior has issued a circular to all departments to investigate whether the admission of Chinese citizens is legal, and ordered officials stationed on the northern border to give special consideration to this matter. The origin of this matter is that the country's newspapers have recently been vigorously promoting that no fewer than tens of thousands of Chinese people have illegally entered Mexican territory. This kind of yellow peril is a real cause for concern, so it should be expelled, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Indian Governor's Remarks: Indians Not Anesthetized <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Betel Publishes an Article</p>
<p>Conflicts Between Indian and Muslim People</p>
<p>Government Assembles Troops</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Bombay, 14th - Betel, chairman of the Indian National Congress delegate assembly, today published an article stating that the Indian Governor's remarks on July 9 have not changed the National Congress's attitude in any way. He is certain that the representatives attending the round table conference will be completely disappointed in the future. According to the report, on July 9, the Indian Governor told both houses that the British government should ensure that the future London round table conference is free from the restrictions of the Westwood report.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Mymensingh, 13th - Conflicts occurred between Muslims and Hindus in the Mymensingh region of Bengal. Yesterday, Muslims destroyed many homes in the village of Kishorganj, and nine Hindus died. Looting, arson, and other actions have not yet stopped. Twenty-five riflemen were dispatched last night, and more troops will be dispatched soon.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Pan-European Federation Plan <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Already in the Second Step</p>
<p>British Reply Not Yet Sent</p>
<p>Many Obstacles to Future Progress</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Paris, 13th - The replies of European countries to Briand's Federation Plan have all been sent, except for that of the United Kingdom. It is difficult to predict whether this move can be realized soon, but it has now entered the second step. Around the time of the League of Nations General Assembly in September, a conference of European powers will be convened to discuss this matter. As for the replies from various countries this time, although the enthusiasm for support varies, none of them openly oppose it. It is expected that the United Kingdom will not be an exception either. However, with the exception of a few countries, all have attached reservations that are a major obstacle to the organization of the federation. For example, Italy strongly advocates the inclusion of Turkey and Russia, the elimination of discriminatory treatment between victorious and defeated countries, the solution of the disarmament issue first, and that it is not necessary to imitate the League of Nations organizational law. It is expected that other countries may attach similar conditions. Even though Germany's reply has not been published, it is said that it indirectly suggests that Russia and Turkey should also be invited. As for the British reply, it may be sent out tomorrow. It is said that the British Prime Minister initially only stated that he had received the letter without adding any affirmation or denial. After Briand personally persuaded him, he agreed to reply in detail. Therefore, the French political circles generally believe that Briand's move will be very difficult, and it is feared that it may become a stalemate at the Geneva Conference.</p>
<p>Special Session Stalled, Hoover Greatly Disturbed</p>
<p>Legislators Refuse to Attend</p>
<p>Compulsory Measures to be Implemented</p>
<p>Sino-American Treaty Postponed for Discussion</p>
<p>▲Associated Press, Washington, 13th - President Hoover still resides at the riverside mansion today, discussing with key figures how to force the senators to attend the special session so that a quorum can be obtained. Since Saturday, a majority of senators have refused to attend the meeting on the grounds of Saturday and Sunday, causing the meeting to be stalled for a day. Hoover is very disturbed by this. Today, he indicated that if it is absolutely necessary, the authorities have the right to arrest senators who fail to attend and force them to attend. This kind of procedure was proposed on the 1st of last week, but it was cancelled because of the large number of attendees. According to the report of Senator Allen, the spokesperson for the Republican Party, it is unlikely that the Naval Treaty will be resolved this week. It is expected that in the next few days, the meeting will focus on debating and considering the reservations that the Naval Treaty should have.</p>
<p>▲Associated Press, Washington, 13th - According to today's news, the ratification procedures for the Sino-American friendship and arbitration treaty in the United States are planned to be postponed until the short session of Congress in December. The leaders of the Senate have all decided that the current special session is too busy with all the issues related to the London Naval Treaty, and it is difficult to address other cases. Pola, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told people that several senators intend to take the opportunity to discuss all matters related to China when the Sino-American agreement is proposed for discussion. At that time, consular jurisdiction may also be included. According to news obtained by the Associated Press today, some senators advocate postponing the discussion of matters concerning the Sino-American agreement until the Chinese war is resolved, and then decide what to do. Other senators advocate waiting for the investigation of the Bitterman Treaty to be completed before addressing other matters.</p>

<p>Parliament Adjourns for Three Weeks</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 13th - Egyptian Foreign Minister Afifi has been appointed as the ambassador to Britain. The foreign minister post left vacant will be filled by Fatah. The Egyptian Prime Minister told Reuters interviewers today that Afifi's mission to Britain is not to continue the interrupted negotiations between Britain and Egypt, but the Egyptian government will of course seize the earliest opportunity to resume negotiations. Today, the Egyptian king issued an order for Parliament to adjourn for three weeks.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, Paris, 13th - Today, French Prime Minister Tardieu spoke in three places in succession. When he spoke at the Veterans Association, he strongly emphasized the justification of the government's order to adjourn Parliament, saying that there are few days left before the summer vacation, and it is difficult to completely pass the important bills. Moreover, the opposition party seems to regard overthrowing the cabinet as Parliament's sole responsibility, so it is appropriate to announce an adjournment.</p>

<p>Four Giants Continue to Hold Meetings</p>
<p>Overall Resolution Expected in a Few Days</p>
<p>Saionji Fully Understands</p>
<p>Attitude of the Privy Council Difficult to Be Optimistic</p>
<p>▲Telecommunications, Tokyo, 14th - Admiral Okada of the Navy, who was dispatched to inspect the Minato Fortress, returned to Tokyo at 7 a.m. this morning and reported the inspection to Zaibu Taniguchi. The Naval Minister immediately invited Admiral Kato to the official residence to continue the meeting of the four naval giants. If Admiral Kato still firmly holds his tough stance, the government will stop the movement to reach an understanding of the new national defense plan and proceed with consultation procedures regardless of the opposition from a part of the Naval Ministry. The naval opposition, which has been troubled for three months and has not been resolved, is expected to be resolved entirely within this week. The government believes that even if there is some opposition, the National Defense Minister and the Chief of the General Staff, who are responsible for national defense, consider the national defense replenishment plan that has been established to be appropriate, so there is no problem. However, the Privy Council has not allowed for optimism. Some who advocate a tough stance say (1) The Privy Council is an amateur in terms of national defense issues, but it is a matter of course to value the strength of troops and whether the national defense plan has obtained the approval of the Marshal's Office and the Military Council, the highest military advisory body. (2) If the government initially intended to disregard the opinions of military experts, there is no need to run around for a movement of understanding now. Today's move can be described as a violent act.</p>
<p>▲Telecommunications, Tokyo, 14th - Foreign Minister Shidehara visited Prince Saionji this morning, the 13th. On the way back from Okitsu yesterday, he told reporters in the car, "Prince Saionji's complexion is very good and his energy has completely recovered, but his foot disease has not fully healed and he cannot walk along the coast. I talked with him in the room for two hours. Regarding the consultation issue of the London Treaty, the Prince knows it very well and said that he was quite worried when the reply instructions were sent at the time of the meeting. As for this consultation issue, there is no suspense at all."</p>
<h3 id="e43">Japanese Budget: Revenue Shortfall <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Exceeds 70 Million Yen</p>
<p>▲Telecommunications, Tokyo, 14th - The amount of the decrease in revenue for the 5th year of the Showa era, calculated from recent actual results, is likely to exceed 70 million yen. In terms of taxes alone, customs duties will decrease by 30 million yen. Counting stamp revenue and other items, it will exceed 60 million yen. In addition, government business revenue will decrease by 10 million yen due to the economic downturn. The total revenue shortfall is over 70 million yen. The Ministry of Finance's administrative economy and savings plan and the method of postponing payment of the naval budget are difficult to finalize, and the army is absolutely unmoved. Regarding the army and navy's original request for 45 million yen, it would be a great fortune if the army and navy could save 25 million yen. In the end, the total savings of each province and ministry is limited to 55 million yen and may not reach 60 million yen. The excess of expenditure over revenue in the budget for the 5th year of the Showa era will reach over 15 million yen. It is extremely noteworthy how Finance Minister Inoue will deal with it.</p>

<p>Suspension of Operations for One Month Starting in August</p>
<p>Will Likely Lead to Unemployment Problems</p>
<p>▲Telecommunications, Tokyo, 14th - The silk reeling association in Kamiina, Shinshu, has resolved to suspend operations altogether after August, as seen in yesterday's dispatch. Currently, in order to thoroughly implement this suspension of operations, commissioners are being dispatched to Matsumoto City and Okaya to speak to silk reelers throughout the prefecture and the country. However, in Suwa, there is a fear that the unemployment problem of the local people will become more serious, and a movement to stop the suspension of operations has begun. Currently, negotiations are underway with the Nagano Prefectural Office to provide low-interest funds to be repaid in five years, in order to pay half of the wages. Therefore, the realization of the suspension of operations is likely to be quite difficult.</p>
<p>▲Telecommunications, Tokyo, 14th - Five silk reeling factories outside Yatsuo Town, Toyama Prefecture, have resolved to suspend operations for one month starting on August 1st, due to the current silk industry slump and huge losses. As a result, more than a thousand workers will lose their jobs.</p>

It was found that Pangalos had given certain rights to people, and the special committee considered it to be an act of harming national income and was clearly an act of corruption. He was sentenced to two years in prison and deprived of public rights for five years on April 8th of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Origin of Plane Accident in Switzerland Cleared <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Driver's Injuries Have Slightly Improved</p>
<p>Admits to Distributing Leaflets Without Hesitation</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Biel, 13th - The Italian aviator Bassanesi's injuries have slightly improved today and he can speak clearly. He declared that he was the one who flew to Laren on Friday afternoon and distributed anti-fascist leaflets. He lost his way because he was chased by Italian army planes, which led him to stray into the St. Gotthard Glacier area and crashed the plane into the mountain. He also said that when he traveled from Paris to Laren, he landed at a small airfield near Villens-sur-Bienne, Switzerland. A truck transported the leaflets onto the plane without being noticed by the airfield staff. However, he refused to reveal the truck number, the printing house, and who supplied the leaflets and provided the funds. As for the three passports found in the plane, all of which had his photo attached but had different names, he also refused to explain anything. Although the Swiss newspapers are reluctant to involve Switzerland in the political strife between the Italian government and the anti-fascists, they cannot help but admire Bassanesi's courage and spirit of a sportsman for daring to take such a great risk, knowing that he would hardly be able to save his life if he was caught in Italian territory.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Rome, 13th - Italian newspapers are competing to condemn the distribution of anti-fascist leaflets in Milan. For example, the Italian People's Daily stated that the fate suffered by the aviator was God's punishment. It also said that this shows that Paris is a center for anti-fascist activities. It is expected that the government will work hard to negotiate with France and Switzerland, because not only did someone in Switzerland supply the leaflets, but also reported the weather. Therefore, many other newspapers are also threatening Switzerland, saying that Italy can no longer tolerate anyone in Switzerland secretly helping the anti-fascist movement.</p>

<p>Plane Crashes in Mountains in Burma</p>
<p>One Exhausted and Falls Ill</p>
<p>One Missing</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Rangoon, 14th - The plane of Australian aviators Hook and Macintosh crashed in the mountains due to a broken oil pipe. Hook was more seriously injured than Macintosh. The food and water they carried were very limited, and the two also contracted miasma. Macintosh supported Hook as they walked, but the mountain road was rugged and difficult to walk. During the day, they stumbled on dangerous roads, and at night, they slept in bamboo forests. After a few days, Hook was exhausted and asked to stay in a villager's home. Macintosh then walked alone and arrived at Pulom, which is 161 miles northeast of Rangoon. The two men planned to fly from London to Australia, but unexpectedly crashed in the mountains just after entering Burma on July 3rd.</p>
<p>Macintosh is now lying ill in Pulom due to fatigue from running around and is being treated by a doctor. Hook is still missing. The police and villagers are searching for him together with a doctor. According to Macintosh, when the plane crossed the Yoma Mountains, it crashed into a bamboo forest. The two slid to the ground and were not seriously injured, but the plane was broken. He and Hook walked along the Buya River for seven days. Food and water dwindled day by day. On the seventh day, Hook was too ill to continue, so it was decided that he would seek help. Just as he was about to run out of strength, he suddenly encountered a team of villagers and was rescued and reached Pulom.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Central and National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Central Party Headquarters held its 68th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on July 14th in the auditorium. Attendees included Central Committee members Chen Guofu, Liu Lu Yin, Chen Lifu, Yu Jingtang, and staff from various departments and invited guests, totaling approximately 500 people. Chairman Chen Guofu presided. After the ceremony, Yu Jingtang delivered a report, briefly stating that regarding recent military developments, Zhang Guijun's forces intruding into Hunan province have been severely defeated by the Central Army and are nearing complete annihilation. As for the enemy on the Longhai Railway, Shi Yousan's troops have largely surrendered their weapons and are no longer capable of fighting. The Jin Army under Zhang Huizhao on the Jinpu Railway</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>have been routed by the Central Army and dare not attempt to invade southward again. Jinan can be recovered soon. Viewing the overall military situation, it is certain that the rebels can be eliminated in short order and that final victory will be achieved. Regarding the two factions of the Western Hills Group, although they have been active in the north for a long time, they are actually at odds with each other, each pursuing their own agendas and competing for power. The so-called cadre meeting initiated earlier this month was much ado about nothing. In the end, the two factions' opinions clashed like fire and water, making unity impossible, and the matter was dropped. Recently, due to the Central Army's repeated victories, they attempted to cover up information from the northerners and prevent panic in the rear by holding a so-called enlarged meeting. This was purely a pointless act of self-deception. The result was further discord between the military, government, and party. Chen Gongbo did send a telegram to Wang Jingwei, stating that the northern finances were unsustainable, party affairs were increasingly chaotic, he could not continue, and was prepared to leave. Wang also replied by telegram to Chen, saying that discussing the party with them was impossible, that he would not come north, and that Chen should not leave hastily to avoid being ridiculed. The situation in the north can be seen from this. At a time when the reactionary forces have not yet been eliminated, how to advance politics and improve party affairs is truly the work and responsibility that our comrades must absolutely bear. Since the reorganization of party affairs in the 17th year of the Republic, there has been considerable progress, but imperfections are unavoidable, which we must acknowledge. Although the criticisms from inside and outside the party regarding the party's achievements and the attacks on those responsible are often superficial and lack grounding in reality, we should reflect on ourselves and be more vigilant. Lower-level party branches have several shortcomings: (1) too much emphasis on appearances, often with thoughts of overstepping their bounds, neglecting their actual work and showing little results; (2) merely conduits for orders from higher-level party branches, lacking vitality; (3) ignorance of the meaning of division of labor and cooperation, with those responsible for propaganda considering the organization and training departments as completely separate; (4) when disagreeing with the instructions of higher-level party branches, not presenting reasons and applying for reconsideration based on party discipline, but instead distributing flyers and engaging in attacks. All these points must be corrected. In the future, the entire party should strive for innovation. In all work, remain still when stillness is appropriate, without resorting to oversimplification; act when action is appropriate, without acting rashly; have a positive spirit and strive for the progress of the party and the development of all undertakings, so that the national revolution can be completed as soon as possible. This is what I have to offer to you all today, etc. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM after the report.</p>
<p>The National Government held Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at 10:00 AM on the same morning. Attendees included Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Ma Fuxiang, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruiheng, Zhang Nanxian, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Lin Xiang, Zhang Wohua, Chen Yu, Ju Siyu, and over 200 staff from the two departments of civil officials and military advisors of the National Government. Chairman Gu Yingfen presided. After the ceremony, Secretary Qian Changzhao delivered a report. (Three months ago) I raised the issue of self-determination for Far Eastern nations. At that time, Indian nonviolent resistance had just begun, the revolutionary forces in Annam were growing, and the Philippine Independence Congress issued a declaration listing reasons for demanding autonomy. The atmosphere surrounding the Korean independence movement was tense. In the past three months, no significant developments have been heard from Korea. In the Philippines, the declaration of independence by the Independence Congress has not been approved by the United States, causing great resentment among the general population and a tendency to continue until the goal is achieved, with specific expressions such as student strikes. However, judging from the current attitude of the United States towards the Philippines, Philippine independence will probably not be achieved immediately. The revolution in Annam is intensifying daily, with many young people sacrificing themselves as a result. French high-pressure tactics may not be able to solve the problem completely. The influence of nonviolent resistance in India is very significant and is worth studying in detail. Four points should be noted in nonviolent resistance: (1) the general awakening of the Indian people. Although religions, languages, and classes differ throughout India, all areas have followed suit since the beginning of this nonviolent resistance. The number of those arrested has reached three to four thousand, and their courage has not diminished. (2) the appeal of Gandhi's personality and the efforts of his followers. Gandhi has fought for 40 years and has been imprisoned several times. This fearless spirit is not only revered in India but also influences foreigners who happen to meet him. After reading Dr. Aet's speech, one can imagine the attractiveness of Gandhi's personality. Reading the conversation between Gandhi and the Commissioner Shorokomb in prison is even more admirable. Some say that the Indian nationalist movement is centered on Gandhi, which is no exaggeration. As for Gandhi's followers, such as Taiboji, they all have unwavering determination and have always fought in accordance with Gandhi's principles. When Gandhi was arrested and a meeting of 100,000 people became very emotional, he calmly announced the absolute avoidance of violence. His ability to implement the principles of nonviolent resistance is truly unmatched. Now that Taiboji and others have also been arrested, there are many who follow. (3) the political power of the All-India National Congress. Since the beginning of non-violent resistance, the National Congress has fought in unison with Gandhi, and its leaders, such as Nehru, have been very diligent. Now that Nehru and others have been arrested, the work of the National Congress headquarters and the National Congresses in various provinces is still ongoing. (4) the participation of Indian women in nonviolent resistance is also very important. Mrs. Naidu, Mrs. Munshi, and Mrs. Kaipteng have all been arrested for this reason, but many women continue their efforts and are not intimidated, which is commendable. As mentioned above, the impact of nonviolent resistance is so great that Britain is finding it difficult to cope. Recently, those in Britain who sympathize with India include the Independent Labour Party, which has expressed itself at times, and women's groups have held meetings to resolve to petition the government, and Canon Belden of the Central Church in London occasionally made statements on humanitarian grounds, but nothing else has been heard. There are also very few who advocate using force to solve the Indian problem. The majority hope to solve everything with the planned Round Table Conference, but even if the Round Table Conference is convened, the outcome is difficult to predict. If Britain uses the Simon Commission report as the basis for discussion, India may not be satisfied, and Britain may not fully accept the various conditions put forward by India. The future is not optimistic. Let's see how things change in the future. Domestically, in terms of military affairs, the insurgent side on the Jinpu Railway is receiving support in their difficulties, but they will certainly collapse soon. The rebel forces on the Longhai and Pinghan Railways have suffered almost complete losses and can be eliminated soon. Zhang Guijun's remaining rebels have been completely defeated by us and should not be a problem in the future. The communist bandits in Jiangxi are taking advantage of the situation to attempt to succeed, but they have also been successively suppressed. The overall situation is very optimistic. Recently, the weather has been unusually hot, and the frontline generals and soldiers are working very hard. We in the rear should make twice the effort.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Contact Between Korean and Jin Armies on the Jiaoji Railway <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao-Jinan traffic completely interrupted.</p>
<p>Four-nation consuls discuss maintaining traffic.</p>
<p>Jinan dispatch: After the Korean army retreated from the east, it actively deployed on the Jiaoji Line, planning a counterattack. On the evening of the 5th, the Korean and Jin armies began to make contact. On the Jin army side on the Jiaoji Line, the front was the 5th Army of Li Fuying, the left wing was the 3rd Army of Wang Jingguo, and the right wing was the 9th Army of Feng Pengzhu. There was also the newly formed 1st Army concurrently commanded by the 1st Division Commander Shi Fengming, who was responsible for colluding with local miscellaneous troops and bandits. On the Korean army side, the defenses were also very carefully deployed. On the 8th and 9th, the fighting west of the Putongzhan ordinary station in Zihedian became more intense, with artillery exchanges. The Korean army's front line of defense extended north to Da Wang Bridge, south to the southwest of Putongzhan ordinary station, with Zihedian in the middle, which was the focus of the fighting between the two armies. Zihedian is located 20 li east of Xindian, Putongzhan ordinary station is 14 li southeast of Zihedian, and Da Wang Bridge is 30 li north of Zihedian. The mountain peaks rise and fall, and the terrain is precipitous, making it a natural battlefield. It is not easy for the Jin army to advance eastward. In order to resist the Korean army's offensive, Yan Xishan specially dispatched Zhongshan No. 3 armored train to assist in the battle. The armored train arrived in Jinan from Cangzhou early on the 9th and was immediately transferred to Xindian Station on the Jiaoji Railway. Mines were also planted near Xindian west of Zihedian. At present, residents near Zihedian are fleeing to various places.</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM on the 5th, the special service regiment of the Jin army Shi Fengming's force, Cui Jiantang's force, also made contact with the Korean army 30 li southeast of Zhangdian. Its 2nd Regiment Feng Daming's force opened fire with the Korean army south of Zihedian. The rest of the 4th Regiment Guo Ziming's force moved out in Boshan. The 1st Regiment Li Ganqing's force plotted to disturb Linzi. The guard regiment</p>
<p>Cai Guanjun's force plotted to disturb Qingzhou. The 2nd Regiment Wang Shaozhou's force plotted to disturb Zhuyezhen. The separate detachment Su Zhenhua's force plotted to disturb Guangrao. Since the Jin and Korean armies began contact on the evening of the 5th, the railway between Jinlingzhen and Xindian on the Jiaoji Railway was destroyed, and traffic between Qingdao and Jinan was interrupted. According to reliable information from the transportation sector, a section of the railway track between Jinlingzhen and Xindian had its screws removed by the military, and the rails were still floating on top and had not been moved. Therefore, the 6th train leaving from Jidong on the Jiaoji Railway on the 6th arrived at Zhangdian and was changed to the 5th train at 9:00 PM and returned to Jinan. On the same day, the 5th train leaving from Qingdao west arrived at Da Xu River and was changed to the 6th train and returned to Qingdao. The interruption of traffic on the Jiaoji Railway has caused diplomatic problems. There are rumors of protests and troop dispatches by the Japanese.

<h3 id="e52">Chen Jitang's Report After Returning to Guangdong <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Chen Mingshu Criticizes the Reasons for Zhang Guijun's Defeat</p>
<p>A moment of silence at the Memorial Week to mourn Zhang Shide</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Yesterday (the 7th), military, political, and party circles held a joint memorial week at the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters Auditorium. After Chairman Chen Jitang performed the ceremonial rituals, Chen Jitang reported, stating that he had returned to the province from the front on the 4th. Regarding the recent fighting with Zhang Guijun in southern Hunan, it can be said that the enemy has been completely annihilated. Today, I can briefly report on the course of events. First, regarding party affairs and politics, the Central Committee held a Supervisory Committee meeting on June 19 and resolved various regulations, and the Guangdong provincial and municipal party committees will be re-elected. The Fourth Representative Congress of the entire province is about to be convened, and the organizational regulations of the congress are being drafted. Regarding the political aspect, the government is vigorously building Zhongshan Port and is scheduled to hold the port opening ceremony on July 20. Secondly, great progress has been made in completing highways and promoting good governance in various counties. Regarding the central military, our army on the Longhai Road has advanced towards Kaifeng, killing tens of thousands of enemies. The enemy on the Pinghan Line has lost contact. The Central Army's abandonment of Jinan on the Jinpu Line was a temporary strategic measure. Speaking of the Battle of Hengyang in Hunan Province, Zhang Guijun's forces and the remnants of Zhou Lan and Tang Shengming can be said to have been completely annihilated. After Zhang rebelled and disturbed Changsha, the three divisions of Jiang, Cai, and Li had already captured Hengzhou, Hengshan, and Hengyang. The Guilin rebel forces of Huang Shaohong and Gong Xuchu were still lingering around Qiyang and attacked our positions, but were repelled by Jiang's division. Commander Jiang decided to hold the east bank of Hengyang firmly. The rear forces, Yu's division and Huang's teaching brigade, were on alert in Yuechang Jiufeng. After the enemy retreated to Changsha, they invaded Leiyang via Youxian and Anren, and joined forces with Huang's rebel forces in Qiyang. On the 26th of last month, they attacked our troops stationed on the east bank of Hengyang. There were also casualties on our side in this battle. On the 27th, there was fierce fighting on the west bank. On the 28th, He Jian's 4th Route Army arrived in Hengzhou to take over the defense. On the 30th, Jiang and Li's two divisions launched a general offensive against the enemy, with Cai's division serving as a reserve force and Yang Tenghui fighting fiercely in close combat, hand-to-hand. On July 1, Shen Guanghan's brigade rushed to the front line, and the enemy collapsed completely, retreating straight to Qiyang. In this battle, the enemy suffered no less than 12,000 casualties. Many were captured by Hua Zhenzhong's brigade during the rout. It is a pity that our Brigade Commander Zhang Shide died in action due to being hit by a stray bullet while leading his troops. Now, in addition to sending teams to pursue the remaining enemies, Yu's division has been ordered to return to Guizhou to completely eliminate the remnants, etc.</p>
<p>Next, Chen Mingshu spoke, "Commander Chen has just reported, and I think everyone heard it with great satisfaction. Now, I will briefly supplement the reasons why Zhang Guijun was resolved this time, so that the public can understand. When the enemy attempted to enter Hunan, they could invade Wuhan. The Eighth Route Army was ordered to pursue, and at that time, they were no less than ten days away from the enemy, so they had to hurry into Hunan. After the division arrived in Anren, the enemy had already occupied Changsha. After our army captured Hengzhou, we heard that the enemy had returned to fight the Eighth Route Army. At that time, we thought that the enemy had seen the main force in Wuhan coming straight down, so they had to return. According to our initial expectations, Zhang Guijun would not be so bold. Later, they actually crossed Liling and Pingxiang and pressured our positions, which was really inexplicable. The enemy had no less than 20,000 men, and we already knew their combat effectiveness. Therefore, we discussed with Commander Chen and thought that we could order the three divisions of Jiang, Cai, and Li to go straight down, and the rear forces of Yu, Huang, etc. could join in, which would have a pincer effect and would be a legitimate military tactic. Later, we feared that the enemy would attack us in full force and would definitely fight desperately, and we were afraid that the rear forces would not arrive on time, so we did not do it. Therefore, we had to take surprise tactics. The three divisions of Jiang, Cai, and Li were all concentrated in Hengzhou, while the rear forces were in Yuechang. The enemy rushed forward and cut off Leiyang, but unexpectedly, they found nothing after arriving in Leiyang. At that time, Bai Chongxi did not know how to respond and was at a loss, so he attacked Jiang, Cai, and Li in Hengzhou again. On the 28th, there was a fierce battle around Qitang and Batang. On the 29th, Brigade Commander Zhang Shide fought with Yang Tenghui, and the enemy collapsed completely. Regarding this battle, I can say that the enemy has committed a major taboo in military strategy. After retreating to Changsha, they attacked Leiyang, and after arriving in Leiyang, they returned to Hengzhou. Being transferred east and west like this, they were exhausted. How could they withstand it? Therefore, the enemy suffered no less than 10,000 casualties this time. The result of their failure is here. Now they are fleeing back to their old nest in Guangxi. It is a pity that Brigade Commander Zhang Shide of the Ninth Brigade led his troops in the battle this time, resulting in his death on the battlefield, which is deeply regrettable. Now, please stand up and observe a moment of silence for Brigade Commander Zhang," etc.</p>
<p>Zhang Shide, commander of the 9th Brigade of the 61st Division, was killed by a bullet to the head in the Battle of Paishan in Hengyang one day. Commander Chen was deeply saddened upon hearing the news. He immediately ordered the business office to allocate 10,000 yuan for Zhang's memorial service and appointed Zhuang Weigang, director of the rear of the 61st Division, to prepare for the memorial service together with Chen Fuyuan, director of the rear of the 9th Brigade, and ordered all officers and soldiers in the rear to wear black armbands for three days to express their condolences. All affairs of the Ninth Brigade are temporarily handled by Division Commander Jiang Guangnai. It is said that the position of brigade commander will be filled by Zhang Yan, the regimental commander of the brigade. Zhang Yan is Zhang Shide's cousin.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Shantou Banks to be Banned <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Due to excessive issuance of banknotes, destabilizing the financial system.</p>
<p>Shantou dispatch: Shantou banks and money changers have issued banknotes totaling as much as 5 million. In recent years, due to the decline in land prices, some have gone bankrupt and cannot redeem their notes. Therefore, last year, when Chen Guoqu was mayor, the city government submitted six proposed measures to the Department of Finance to be banned, stipulating that the city government, the central branch, and the chamber of commerce should jointly organize a review agency to implement the ban. However, over the past year, the city government has repeatedly convened meetings to organize a review agency, but the chamber of commerce has repeatedly used excuses to refuse to send representatives to attend, which has prevented the agency from being established. Recently, due to the gold price issue, silver merchants have resumed speculative business, which unfortunately failed, and the banks went bankrupt immediately, which has greatly affected the city's financial situation. The Department of Finance specially ordered the city government a few days ago to quickly comply with the measures and implement the ban. If the chamber of commerce still refuses to send representatives to form a review agency, then the city government will handle it together with the Central Bank. The reporter went to the city government yesterday to inquire about the progress of the ban from Mr. Ye Weiqing, director of the Finance Bureau, who said that a meeting is now scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 10th to organize a review agency. The six proposed measures are as follows: (1) The issuance of banknotes by various banks in Shantou City should be reviewed by an agency jointly organized by the city government, the central branch, and the chamber of commerce. First, the number of banknotes issued by each bank and the types and values of guaranteed real estate should be thoroughly and accurately investigated. Their valuations should be estimated separately and should not exceed 70 percent of the value. That is, real estate worth 10,000 yuan can only guarantee a value of 7,000 yuan. The method of valuation should be based on the general market situation. The amount of rent that can be obtained for every 10,000 yuan of property should be used as the standard for estimating the current rent of the real estate. In addition to real estate, a cash deposit of 20 percent should also be paid. That is, a bank issuing 10,000 yuan of banknotes should pay a cash deposit of 2,000 yuan. The remaining 8,000 yuan is allowed to be guaranteed by real estate. The guaranteed cash and real estate deeds are all kept by the review agency. (2) The issuance of banknotes by banks in Chaozhou and Meizhou prefectures should be handled in accordance with these measures. The city and county magistrates of each prefecture and city should jointly organize a review agency with the local chamber of commerce. (3) The banknotes issued in Shantou City and Chaozhou and Meizhou prefectures should be limited to the current amount and should not be issued excessively privately. Violators will be severely investigated. Those that have already been issued must be restricted to a maximum amount, and a plan for gradual reduction should be scheduled and recovered within a reasonable period. How to limit the amount and how to determine the time limit should be reviewed by the review agency based on the local situation and reported for approval. When contracting, the review agency should review the extent to which the contraction has been made, and the guaranteed real estate should be returned in proportion to the extent of the contraction. If it is impossible to contract, the guaranteed real estate will be auctioned off for compensation. The auction procedures are still handled by the chamber of commerce as before. (4) If the guarantees for the issuance of banknotes by various banks in Shantou City are not deemed adequate after review, they must be ordered to contract. Banks in Chaozhou and Meizhou prefectures must also be ordered to provide guarantees, otherwise they must be banned to maintain the financial system. (5) Banks that enjoy the benefits of issuing banknotes should be subject to taxes levied by the government. The standard for taxation should be 300 yuan per year for every 10,000 yuan of banknotes issued. Before the current issuance system is temporarily unified, the number of banknotes issued by each bank should be reported to the review agency for detailed registration in order to be totaled. (6) The face value of each banknote issued by a bank should not be less than 10 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Harbin Market Fire <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Over 500 buildings were destroyed.</p>
<p>Total losses exceeded one million yuan.</p>
<p>Harbin dispatch: On the morning of the 6th, the weather was overcast and rainy, and it cleared up in the afternoon, but the wind was very strong and did not stop until the evening. A fire broke out in the Jiangbin Market in Harbin City amidst this strong wind, destroying over 300 buildings and over 150 single-story houses. Total losses exceeded one million. The market outside the old Jiangdi levee in Daowai, Harbin, has been opened for many years. The houses are densely packed, and the construction is very poor. No fire prevention ditches are installed in Taiping Road, so once a fire broke out, it spread and could not be extinguished. The fire zone was the northern zone of the market. First, a three-story building near Changchun San Dao Street with 166 rooms was burned. The tenants downstairs were prostitutes, and the second and third floors were rented to small hotels, including Yuanfa Inn, Tianbao Inn, and Tongxin Inn. They owed months of rent, and the landlord Zou Xi repeatedly urged them to pay, but they refused. Recently, Zou sued the Binjiang County Government, which ruled that the tenants be evicted and the houses sealed. On the 5th of this month, the county magistrate sent personnel to execute the order. The three small hotel owners suddenly lost their jobs and resented the landlord. At 9:00 PM on the 6th of this month, they sneaked into an empty room in Yuanfa Inn and set fire to cotton soaked in kerosene. Because the room was unoccupied, it was not immediately noticed. At 9:15 PM, the flames were visible through the windows, and people nearby noticed and immediately reported to the police at the street corner. At that time, the market was crowded with people. Upon hearing the fire alarm, the order was disrupted, and men, women, old, and young ran to avoid it, blocking the road. By the time the fire trucks arrived, the road was already impassable. It took a long time to reach the vicinity of the fire scene. At that time, the fire had already engulfed the entire building due to the wind, and it spread to the neighboring houses. The fire brigade tried its best to put out the fire, but there were no wells nearby, making it difficult to get water, and the buildings were too high, making it difficult to fight the fire. They only inspected the nearby single-story houses for rescue. At 9:30 PM, the fire intensified, and six surrounding buildings and four single-story houses were all affected. The fire brigades of all public and private organizations in the city arrived one after another around 10:00 PM, but they were unable to put out the fire and allowed it to burn until 3:00 AM on the morning of the 7th. The entire area of over 340 buildings, over 150 single-story houses, and 60 sheds was reduced to ashes. After the incident, it was investigated that the burned landlords included Zou Xi, with 166 buildings and 87 single-story houses, Sun Ruyuan, with 132 buildings and 15 single-story houses, and Wang Jintang, with 44 buildings and 48 single-story houses. Among the burned businesses, those with larger capital and losses exceeding 20,000 yuan included Hengchang Lumber Company and Deshengchang Lumber Factory. The remaining 16 small hotels, 26 prostitutes, and 68 small businesses were statistically counted. Because the fire started around 9:00 PM, when it was still sultry and people had not yet gone to sleep, there were no deaths. It is said that all the landlords were insured, and the only ones suffering were the general small businesses. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Fierce Battle Between Zhejiang Naval Police and Pirates <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Xiangshan Port Declares Martial Law</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province's coastal defense arrangements have always been very strict, so the various pirate gangs, though extremely fierce, have ultimately failed to succeed. Currently, with bandit gangs rampant in the inland counties of eastern Zhejiang, pirates are also seizing the opportunity to stir up trouble. Wang Wenhan, commander of the bandit suppression in the four prefectures of Ningbo, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, and Taizhou, and concurrently director of the Zhejiang Outer Seas Naval Police Bureau, recently received repeated secret reports that the Xin'ao and Sheng'ao pirate gangs have re-emerged and are plotting to disturb the peace on the seas. He immediately dispatched two teams of naval police and one squadron of guerilla troops, along with patrol ships, to patrol day and night. They encountered a group of about 500 pirates in the Qingzi Port area, and a fierce battle ensued, lasting about three hours. The pirates, unable to withstand the attack, dispersed in three directions. One group headed towards Xiangshan Port, one retreated directly to Shenjiamen Port, and the remaining group fled towards the North Yushan area. As a result, the Xiangshan County government, in order to prevent the spread of disaster, declared martial law. County Magistrate Zhang Zhouwen and the stationed security team and public security bureau discussed measures to implement strict inspections. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of the Navy requesting the dispatch of warships for joint defense. It is now known that the Jingxing gunboat dispatched by the Ministry of the Navy, seeing that Xiangshan already had security measures in place, went directly to the Shenjiamen sea area to join the army and police in encircling and suppressing the pirates. The provincial government also dispatched an additional regiment of security troops yesterday to assist in the suppression. However, according to other news from fishermen and merchants, the Zhejiang naval police have already killed a pirate leader, and the remaining pirates have dispersed and gone into hiding. (14th)</p>

<p>The provincial government received an order from the Ministry of Communications to investigate the two cases of collisions between the Wenfu and Quandali steamships operating in Wenzhou and Fuquan. The ministry has dispatched personnel to Zhejiang to conduct on-site investigations in Wenzhou together with personnel dispatched by the provincial government, to determine how to compensate and provide relief to the dozens of victims in Zhejiang. At the same time, the Yongjia County Magistrate and the Fourth District Navigation Administration Bureau have been ordered to report the findings of their investigations for review.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Relief Association's procurement of unpolished rice to assist various counties in stabilizing rice prices is nearing completion. The association has approved 7,000 bags of rice for the four townships of Hang County. The remaining rice is less than 6,000 dan, and many counties still have a shortage of rice. The distribution will only be carried out to the extent possible.</p>
<p>Zhang Jun, the magistrate of Tiantai County, has been repeatedly accused of corruption and dereliction of duty. The Department of Civil Affairs has dispatched personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. Ye Wen, the magistrate of Changshan County, has monopolized the entire county's slaughter tax, which has been met with strong opposition from meat merchants. The Department of Finance and the Department of Civil Affairs have reportedly issued orders to the county to report the matter for review and handling.</p>
<p>The Department of Construction believes that the accounting personnel of its subordinate agencies are not competent enough due to a lack of specialized talent. Therefore, a specialized accounting personnel office has been established in the department. The accounting personnel of each agency will be directly appointed by the department, so that their knowledge and experience can be used to their full potential. In addition, accounting supervisors from the department will be dispatched to provide guidance and inspection at any time.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou municipal rice price stabilization factory is divided into five locations. It opened on May 1st, and this term has been specially extended for one month until the end of August. Shen, the general manager of the Three Warehouses, has already prepared sufficient rice for sale. However, the amount of rice sold daily at each factory has been slightly restricted to 25 dan to avoid financial strain. It is also known that the rice price stabilization bureau in the Guobao district attached to the city began on June 1st. The funds were raised locally, and the rice was purchased from the Three Warehouses at a fixed price. The end date is also the end of August.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou municipal residence and store property tax, since it was changed to a minimum of two yuan, has been difficult to collect due to the large population. There are places where those who are urged to pay simply ignore the request. The Finance Bureau of the municipal government has specially set the tax collection period to two months to expedite the collection of overdue taxes and replenish public funds.</p>

<p>Confession of Ye Xie Capture of Thieves: The county government recently received a secret report that Chen Adi, a bandit, and his bandit wife Chen Luo (the wife of Chen Xiuming, who was killed by his accomplices last year) are hiding in Xiaobazi Bridge, Eleventh District, Ye Xie, and are plotting to cause trouble in Punan.

<p>Abusing His Wife and Assembling a Crowd to Beat the Police: Zhu A'yu, a villager from Shangdiyan Township, Meijing, Wan'an City (District 16) in the county, is 26 years old. He used to work as a partner in a restaurant in Shanghai. In the eighth month of the year before last, he married Jiang Li's daughter Chun'di from Zhoushanbang through a matchmaker. After she entered the household, the couple was still harmonious. Unexpectedly, less than a year later, A'yu suddenly changed his behavior and spent his days wandering around. Despite his wife's kind劝劝, A'yu repeatedly refused to listen and often beat Chun'di. Recently, A'yu beat his wife severely for no reason, causing her to be covered in injuries. When Chun'di's birth mother, Jiang Li, learned about this, she submitted a report to the Public Security Bureau requesting that the police arrest A'yu and bring him to justice. After receiving the report, Huang Zhenbai, the director of the Public Security Bureau, immediately dispatched detectives and police officers to the countryside to make the arrest. Unexpectedly, after the police arrived in Zou, Zhu A'yu gathered a crowd of hooligans, including Yuan Songnian, and refused to be arrested, even assaulting the police. The police had no choice but to return to the city and report the incident. Director Huang then dispatched more armed police officers to the countryside to assist in the arrest. Zhu A'yu and five hooligans, including Yuan Songnian, Zhang Xiaogou, Xu Shuxiang, and Xu Baoxiang, were arrested and taken to the bureau to await transfer to the county government for legal action.</p>

<p>Meeting to Raise Funds for Prison Renovation: Shi Zechen, an investigating judicial member of the High Court, was ordered to go to Cheng to urge the raising of funds for the prison. On the afternoon of the 12th, he convened a meeting of various agencies at the county government and resolved: (1) The previous plan to relocate the prison to the Vagrant Work Center was too expensive and difficult to raise funds. According to Mr. Shi's opinion, it was decided to change the plan and expand the original prison. The estimated cost is 6,000 yuan. (2) The renovation funds will be raised separately. The second to fourteenth districts will still follow the previous resolution and each donate 300 yuan. The remaining 2,100 yuan will be raised by the county government and various agencies. (3) The deadline for raising the funds is the end of September. The director of the construction bureau will be appointed as the prison manager and will be responsible for the design.</p>
<p>Zhutang Township Again Seizes a Large Batch of Opium: Gu Qizhang, the head of Zhutang Township in the Eleventh District, and others seized more than thirty catties of opium from the Dongjinji Inn last month and arrested three opium traffickers, including Li Ziqing. They confessed that the large opium trafficker was Sun Huai仁 and that all the opium, more than one hundred catties, was stolen by Dong Jinfang, the owner of the Dongjinji Inn. County Magistrate Li then secretly ordered the Public Security Bureau to dispatch inspector Li Hongze and the detective team leader to the countryside. On the 12th, they searched the firewood pile in the Dongjinji Inn and found more than fifty catties of opium. They then went to Gong Genfu's house in a lane in Lujiaqiao and found that the opium trafficker Sun Huai仁 had fled. They seized more than ten catties of opium and handed them over to the county for legal action.</p>

The Yangxi people repeatedly expressed their opposition and filed complaints with the official authorities, demanding that the weirs be dismantled. The fish farm also repeatedly argued to the province that it did not prevent dredging, grass harvesting, and the raising of miscellaneous aquatic products. In addition to ordering the county to investigate and respond, the Department of Construction also sent two personnel to He to conduct an on-site inspection yesterday. Unexpectedly, the Yangxi people surrounded the provincial commissioner and gathered a large number of civilian boats to dismantle more than one hundred zhang of the fish weirs in sections.

<p>The Financial Difficulties of Local Education in Jiangsu and Their Remedies</p>
<h3 id="e69">Document from the Education Department of Jiangsu Province to the Provincial Government <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang Correspondence) The Education Department of Jiangsu Province submits a document to the Provincial Government regarding the current dire situation of local education funding in the province and points to which attention should be paid when planning comprehensively for its allocation, for consideration. The original text reads:</p>
<p>“Finance is the mother of all administrations, and education is the foundation for a hundred years. In all planning, these two aspects should be given equal consideration. In particular, the education sector should only advance and not regress. Therefore, it is essential that education funding be continuously increased and not reduced in order to safeguard its stability, especially by implementing (independent education funding). For this reason, the texts of (increasing education funding and ensuring its independence) are considered key principles of the Party's political program. Now, at the beginning of political tutelage, vigorously promoting universal education should be the basic work for training the masses and promoting autonomy. Therefore, increasing education funding and ensuring its independence should be prioritized and thoroughly implemented as important policies. In order to carry out this policy, the Finance Department, recognizing the disorder in various county affairs, proposed a plan to reform land taxes and county finances, intending to start with investigation and statistics, and to redistribute all surtax revenue according to percentage ratios. This has been approved by the Provincial Government's 307th Committee meeting. This is a fundamental and necessary measure to reform accounting and administration. The current dire situation of local education funding in this province and the points to which attention should be paid when planning comprehensively are already known to the Provincial Government, and no further elaboration is needed to maintain regulation and harmonization. However, due to my responsibility, I cannot remain silent. I hereby analyze and present them for consideration.</p>
<p>The amount of funding should depend on the degree of need. Speaking only in terms of quantity, the proportion of education funding to other county expenditures may seem slightly high. However, considering the needs of the education sector, many necessary facilities have not been established, and many necessary programs have not been implemented in as much as 80% or 90% of counties. This phenomenon of supply failing to meet demand is not a fabrication of the Education Department. For example, in terms of free education, according to the statistics of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the proportion of school-age children enrolled in school in each county is generally between 15% and 20%. In the counties with the fewest enrolled children, the proportion is only 4%. Thus, the majority of school-age children in each county are unable to attend school due to the failure to extend free education year by year, thus losing their foundation as sound citizens. What could be more painful than this? As for social education, it is still in its infancy, with everything needing to be done, so there is no need to elaborate. In our country, where the number of illiterates accounts for 80% of the population, the low level of culture is alarming. The only way to improve it is to gradually implement free and social education. The National Education Conference this year resolved to complete the plan of free education in 20 years and social education in 6 years, which is a wise decision. Therefore, the implementation of free and social education is not enough to meet the minimum needs. The situation of other general education is similar. Therefore, the education funding in each county is actually at the minimum level when measured against its needs. Moreover, summing up the existing sources of county education funding, such as busy grain transport surtax, busy grain transport with general levy, universal mu donation, and education mu donation, most of it comes from farmland. In recent years, due to banditry, natural disasters, and poor autumn harvests, the actual revenue received is far from the fixed amount. The original plan for free education mu donation was to increase it to 1 jiao 6 fen per mu, but now each county generally collects 8 fen, and some collect only 4 fen. The method of increasing it year by year has been difficult to implement. Thus, the fixed education funding, which is already at the minimum level, has become like the sheep announced but not provided for sacrifice. Since the establishment of the Education Department last year, the financial difficulties of county education funding have been almost constant. Salary demands are frequently heard, and education strikes occur repeatedly. Even today, under the system of independent education funding, where the foundation is relatively solid and changes are more difficult, the current situation is already so difficult. If the system were changed, the disputes would inevitably worsen, and the Finance Department may not achieve the effect of reforming finance, while education would already be bankrupt. This is why the Education Department dares not help but express its concerns. After repeated consideration, regarding the measures to reorganize finance, there seem to be several matters that should be decided in advance, to ensure that they do not contradict the Finance Department's proposals and that the current state of education can be temporarily maintained. I respectfully list them below:</p>
<p>First, no matter what percentage of the total county expenditure education funding constitutes, the original amount of funding in each county must be maintained as the minimum. It is well known that the majority of local education is elementary school, and the work of elementary school teachers is arduous and their salaries are meager. The Education Department, after reviewing the current situation, is angered and worried about it, but is unable to improve it due to financial constraints. I am powerless and full of sighs. I had no choice but to formulate a standard for the distribution of elementary school education funding, the main purpose of which is that the source of education funding is not easy to obtain and should be used economically and efficiently. At the same time, it is also intended to eliminate unnecessary expenses and stabilize salaries, so that elementary school teachers can make a stable living within this minimum limit, so as to be better than the past, when salaries were owed for months and teachers were constantly complaining. Since the Education Department formulated this standard for elementary school funding, all extravagant expenses have been eliminated and cannot be reduced any further. If the total county education funding is suddenly reduced at this time, there will be no extravagant expenses to cut and no surplus funds to supplement. It will be necessary to suspend some of the existing schools at all levels and social education institutions in order to balance the revenue and expenses. This will not only cause panic in the education sector of the entire province, but will also cause the small number of children who are already in school to lose their education and the majority of teachers who have jobs to suddenly become unemployed. The consequences are something that the Education Department cannot bear to say. This is the first point that should be noted.</p>
<p>Second, the education budget should still be prepared separately and should not be mixed with other local budgets. The provincial education funding of Jiangsu Province has been independently managed since five or six years ago. The separate preparation of county education funding budgets has also been approved by the Provincial Government and ordered to be followed. All these existing elements of independent education funding should be preserved. This is to fulfill the political program from above and to comply with the fixed decision from below. Now that the education budgets of each county for the 18th year of the Republic (1929) have been prepared in accordance with the order, the 19th year can be handled according to the previous case, which is a logical and easy way to proceed. It seems that the preparation of the entire county budget can also achieve a mutually beneficial effect. This is the second point that should be noted.</p>
<p>Third, education funding should be stored separately and should not be arbitrarily misappropriated by the county magistrate or finance director to prevent embezzlement. There are already special chapters for the safekeeping of education mu donations, with strict restrictions. However, the collecting agencies in various counties blatantly disregard them and arbitrarily misappropriate large amounts of mu donations and other education taxes. Such cases are still frequently seen and cannot be listed one by one. Whether it is for public or private reasons, once discovered, there is no way to investigate. Some are ordered to strictly pursue the embezzled funds, and some are ordered to be repaid by the successors. Even if the embezzled funds are recovered and repaid, the education funding has already suffered from the disorder. Recently, the Education Department has sent no fewer than several cases to the Finance Department requesting measures to recover the embezzled funds, which is clear evidence. If, in the future, all special education funds are included in the overall allocation, the restrictions will be lifted, and the misappropriation will be even more convenient. To prevent repeating past mistakes, it is necessary to strictly define the boundaries and continue to use the special fund method for separate safekeeping as a guarantee. This is the third point that should be noted.</p>
<p>Fourth, the original accumulated education funds in each county should still be stored in special accounts and should not be used on the pretext of emergency. The funding crisis and hardship of education have been completely described without reservation. However, some general observers may still think that the education budget includes methods for extracting funds and first and second reserve funds, and each county must follow the prescribed proportion for extraction. Therefore, although education funding is tight, there is still a surplus for future planning, which is not as bad as it is said. However, the fund item is used to adapt to the needs of the education sector and expand it year by year, and is also as indispensable as fees for ceremonies. As for the reserve fund rate, it is used to offset the reduction in autumn assessment to avoid the malpractice of virtual revenue and actual expenditure in the budget. In fact, there is no actual revenue. However, I am afraid that as soon as the order for overall allocation is issued, those who do not know the situation will be dazzled by the names of funds and reserve funds, and will rush to divide up the funds for immediate gratification. Those that are not actually received can be left aside. However, if the remaining education funds are all donated to this area, it will not help other administrative income much, but it will be extremely harmful to the future of education. I am extremely concerned about this and believe it is not possible. This is the fourth point that should be noted.</p>
<p>The above four points are all essential issues for maintaining local education in Jiangsu. They are based on common principles and the actual needs to stabilize the current state of education while striving to reorganize finance in order to uphold the purpose of the Provincial Government in attaching importance to the basic work of political tutelage. Therefore, I dare not avoid being tedious and state the facts directly. Whether they are appropriate or not, I respectfully await your review and decision and prompt implementation for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee, Chen Xian, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department.</p>

After exchanging greetings, the Overseas Chinese Boy Scout representatives, Zeng Guangke, Chen Genlin, and Li Wanzhi, led them to visit the Chinese Consulate General in Kobe, the Hyogo Prefectural Office, the Kobe City Hall, various Japanese newspapers, and the Kuomintang branch. After a short rest, they went to the Maru Restaurant to attend the welcome dinner hosted by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. Chinese and Japanese boy scouts shared stories and talked cordially, expressing their friendship. That night, they took a train to Osaka, where they were hosted by the All Japan Boy Scout League for one night. Then, they traveled to Nara, Kyoto, and other famous scenic spots for sightseeing. Initially, the representatives of the Kobe Overseas Chinese Boy Scouts had contacted the Japanese authorities to arrange for them to visit the Kawasaki Shipyard and the Kawanisi Airfield.

<h3 id="e75">The Start of Summer School in Shanghai <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The summer school run by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau held its opening ceremony at Jingye Middle School on Jukui Street yesterday morning. Director Chen, Mayor’s representative Cen Dezhang, Jiang Wenyu, and about 400 attendees were present. Director Chen chaired the meeting and conducted the ceremony.</p>
<p>The chairman delivered a speech, stating that since Shanghai became a municipality, there have been two summer training sessions and training institutes. This year, according to the resolution of the National Education Conference, provinces and municipalities can set up summer schools, and counties and cities under the provinces can set up summer training sessions. Therefore, the name of this session is determined to be the first Shanghai Municipal Summer School, and the period of in-service training is set at five or seven years. During this period, elementary school teachers and teachers who have passed the certification must continuously attend the previous summer school. Graduates of normal schools, higher normal schools, and university normal departments must also continuously attend two summer schools. The summer school is run by the education administrative agency, and the attendees are elementary school teachers, directly seeking in-service training for teachers and indirectly thinking about all students. Without good teachers, there will be no good students, and without students, there will be no citizens in the future. Therefore, we attach importance to this summer school, so that teachers can take this opportunity to acquire some new knowledge, skills, and methods, and then use new methods, skills, and knowledge to instill in the students. Recently, there has been a misconception that teachers have to come to summer school in order to teach. Because of this misconception, there is a phenomenon of asking for leave on the pretext of illness, which is a big mistake. I think that teachers should rush to join the summer school as soon as they hear about it, because this is an opportunity for teachers to improve themselves, and it is not related to others. This year, there are several special courses with several special lecturers. Education, whether it is skills, methods, or knowledge, is advancing with each passing day. Summer schools can provide everyone with new and advanced information from the mouths of various lecturers. In the past, some elementary school teachers have had erroneous thoughts and reactionary behaviors. We hope that during this period, everyone will encourage and supervise each other, gain improvement and understanding, and pay attention to moral cultivation. The responsibility of teachers is very great. If the students taught in the future commit crimes, it is the teacher's fault. Finally, we should thank the lecturers for taking on the lectures in the hot summer, and the officials and guests who participated in the opening ceremony today.</p>
<p>The mayor's speech was delivered by Cen Dezhang, who said that some people think that they have reached a considerable level, so why bother to attend summer school again? This is a mistake. Education is to enable us to adapt to the environment and increase our ability. The environment is constantly changing, and so is education. Elementary school teachers are usually busy with their homework and have no time for sufficient research. Summer school provides you with an opportunity to research. The establishment of summer schools by the education administrative authorities is a contribution to you, not just for teachers to participate in. In the past, a scholar who was the head of a school would always go to the teachers' offices during his spare time to see if the books on their desks were often changed and beneficial. Otherwise, at the end of the semester, he would not renew their contracts because they did not seek to improve themselves at any time. There is no end to learning. Teachers must move forward without end.</p>
<p>Lecturer's speech (1) Fang Bingguan said that human evolution is based on the fact that society is constantly changing. If they advance and I do not, I will become outdated. Regarding the phonetic symbols, the first time was for the national sound word inspection, and the second time was for the Beijing sound safe mother, but both were unsuccessful. The third time was for the national sound word origin in the second year of the Republic of China (1913), and in the seventh year (1918), the Ministry of Education officially publicized it, taking the Beijing sound as the standard. People in various places could not get used to it, and the emotions on society were not cured, so there was an improvement of the phonetic safe mother this year. The national sound alphabet of the past was to unify the pronunciation first and then popularize education. Now it is to unify the pronunciation in the popularization of education. The national sound problem has undergone several improvements. We cannot be outdated again. Pay attention to the symbols. There is no survey of the national sounds in various provinces at present. It is estimated that it will be completed by the end of the year at the latest. (2) Jiang Wenyu said that he had a little feeling about the summer school. There was no so-called summer vacation before the establishment of new-style education, only annual vacations or busy vacations in rural farming seasons. Now the school has summer vacations and summer schools, which seems contradictory. In fact, it is not contradictory. The private schools of the past were simple, but the schools of today are complicated. The administrative aspects should have finished and prepared future matters. The students should also have a considerable rest or work. Therefore, the summer vacation is not released for no reason, and it also provides teachers with an opportunity to supplement their knowledge and ability, especially elementary school teachers. Although they say that they teach, learn, and do at the same time, there is always more output than input, and new knowledge and skills are needed at all times. Therefore, the summer school is the most beneficial for elementary school teachers. There are many types of summer schools, but they are all to meet the needs, or for further education, or for studying something. Elementary school teachers are studying new methods and new theories to meet the needs. The second is to increase work efficiency. After receiving the training of the summer school and gaining new skills, the work efficiency will naturally increase. The third is to hope for occupational improvement. Occupation is a large part of life, and teachers are the foundation of the country. It is good to improve at all times. I hope that you will recognize the use of summer school, and I wish you occupational improvement.</p>

<p>The Municipal Training Department Continues to Announce</p>
<h3 id="e76">Results of the Municipal Party Education Inspection <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Examination of the Achievement of Party Teachers and Guidance Directors in Middle Schools</p>
<p>17 Encouraged, 24 Corrected</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Department Training Department’s third inspection of Party Ideology Education in the city. The statistics of middle school performance have been published in this newspaper. The department believes that the quality of Party Education performance in a school is not only the responsibility of the principal, but also the efficiency of the Party Ideology teachers and Guidance Directors, which is sufficient to be the basis for performance evaluation. Therefore, when the inspection results were notified to the schools the other day, the Party teachers and Guidance Directors of each school were also notified to encourage them. The third type of statistics made by the department, listing those who should be encouraged and corrected from the current qualified Party Ideology teachers and Guidance Directors in the schools, is as follows:</p>
<p>17 to be encouraged: Zhang Jing’e, Cheng Yulin, Cai Gensen, Liu Weishan, Liang Bingru, Xue Peishao, Tao Qiqing, Jiang Wenbao, Cai Yan, Shen Xibao, Yao Qiwei, Zhou Feicheng, Chen Renyi, Zhu Yakui, Gu Wenwei, Zhou Yilin, Huang Yuqi</p>
<p>24 to be corrected: Bao Huaibai, Mao Jingxue, Pan Shuji, Qin Hegao, Shao Guang, Zhou Yingcai, Yuan Yeyu, Ma Jiazhen, Jin Yuezhang, Zhang Tianbai, Li Tianxing, Lu Wenwan, Zhang Chaoren, Wu Xianren, Zhang Juansheng, Zhang Peiheng, Yang Peiw,en Li Chongpu, Huang Ruchang, Zhou Shuzhuang, Hu Naiwen, Zhang Hanyun, Yang Qingyuan, Chen Mengyu</p>
<p>According to the investigation, there are only 40 Party teachers and Guidance Directors currently employed in middle schools, excluding those who are naturally qualified and those who have transferred from other places. It has also been found that some Party teachers hold concurrent positions in several schools. This phenomenon will inevitably lead to the same work efficiency as Party Ideology and other subjects, and there is no time to take care of other extracurricular activities of students. The true meaning of Party Education is greatly lost. Therefore, the Municipal Training Department is now carefully planning to make corrections.</p>

<p>Meiji will play against China again tomorrow... Resting today</p>
<p>The Meiji University tennis team competed against the Shanghai Portuguese Athletic Association at the China Tennis Court yesterday, divided into two groups for singles and two groups for doubles. As a result, Meiji won all matches. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e88">Doubles (1) <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Sagara Kanavanlo 6 0 4 6 1</p>
<p>Won 1 1 1 1 1</p>
<p>Matsuo Tafoles 4 6 6 4 6</p>
<p>Kanavanlo and Tafoles of Portugal were the Shanghai doubles champions last year, with excellent coordination and skillful play. Sagara and Matsuo of Meiji were also very well-coordinated and fought very hard, never giving up. After the start of the match, Kanavanlo and Tafoles played cautiously and were in a good position. Kanavanlo's volleying and overheads were particularly effective. Sagara and Matsuo fought hard and even tied the score at 4-4. However, the victory of the first set eventually went to Kanavanlo and Tafoles with a score of 6-4. In the second set, Kanavanlo and Tafoles suddenly became careless and frequently made mistakes. Sagara and Matsuo often used high balls from outside the baseline to return shots. Whenever there was an opportunity, they launched powerful attacks. The two even won six consecutive games, winning the set with a score of 6-0. In the third game, Sagara and Matsuo took advantage of the opponent's carelessness again and won with a score of 6-4. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Kanavanlo and Tafoles quickly rallied and also won the fourth set with a score of 6-4. With the score tied at 2-2, the fifth set was played to decide the match. Tafoles of Portugal was impatient and unfocused, almost losing the will to fight. In the end, Sagara and Matsuo won with a score of 6-1, resulting in a final score of 3-2. The referee was Lin Baohua.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Doubles (2) <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Oto Kurasha 3 2</p>
<p>Won 1 1</p>
<p>Koto Leto 6 6</p>
<p>In the second doubles group, the Meiji Fujikura brothers played against Portuguese S. Kurasha and Leto in a best-of-three-sets match. As a result, the Fujikura brothers won two consecutive sets with scores of 6-3 and 6-2. Kurasha was quite confident in catching the ball, but the other types of shots were not impressive, and the ball often hit the net. Leto's ball skills were mediocre. The Fujikura brothers played cautiously and rarely made mistakes. In the first set, Portugal won the first game, but Meiji won the next two. Portugal then tied the score, but Meiji won the next three games in a row, creating a very favorable situation. The Portuguese army's general trend was to lose and it was not easy to recover. Meiji won the first set with a score of 6-3. In the second game, the Fujikura brothers' momentum increased, and although the Portuguese army won the first game, they then lost five consecutive games. As a result, they lost again with a score of 2-6. The referee was Ma Detai.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Singles (1) <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Komatsu wins against Kurasha 2-1</p>
<p>In the first singles group, Portuguese H. Kurasha played against Meiji's Komatsu. Both players were very cautious. However, Kurasha unfortunately lost too many points in the third set and was defeated. In the first set, Kurasha's ball momentum was very smooth and he was able to do whatever he wanted, winning the set with a score of 6-0. Starting from the second set, Komatsu won the first two games, Kurasha caught up with two games, and Komatsu won two more games. Kurasha desperately attacked and only managed to win one game. As a result, Komatsu won with a score of 6-4. The situation was tense in the third set. After Komatsu won the first game, he lost continuously. Kurasha feinted to the east and attacked to the west, making it difficult for Komatsu to lift the frame, creating a ratio of 4 to 1, and Kurasha won. At this point, Kurasha had a great chance of winning. Unexpectedly, he lost points frequently afterwards. In addition, Komatsu's steady draw caused Kurasha to plummet. As a result, Komatsu won again with a score of 6-4. The referee was Lasmussen.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Singles (2) <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Matsuo wins against Tafoles...2-1</p>
<p>The first group of singles was Matsuo (Meiji) against Tafoles (Portugal). Both people had been in intense battles in the doubles match and had slightly reduced energy, but they still refused to show weakness. The competition was also quite fierce. Tafoles was calm and worked hard, winning the first set with a score of 6-4. Starting from the second set, Tafoles became fiery again, and his mind and hand could not correspond. He only won one game in the fourth game. As a result, he lost with a score of 1-6. In the third set, they initially progressed side by side, each getting two games. After that, Matsuo won victory by victory, and Tafoles had no intention of fighting again, losing again and again. Matsuo also won the third set with a score of 6-1. The referee was Ma Detai.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Meiji to Play China Again Tomorrow <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>

Previously, the China team defeated the University team with a score of 3-0, while the University team lost to the China team with a score of 1-3. It is reported that Lin Saihua of the China team has injured his arm and cannot compete. Therefore, Jiang Daozhang and Zheng Zhaojia will play in tomorrow's doubles match.</p>

<p>Tilden is dismissed from the tennis tournament for signing and writing newspaper manuscripts, which violates the competition rules</p>
<p>Athletes' compliance with the rules</p>
<p>According to a United London dispatch on the 7th, the American Tennis Association requested that Tilden, who won the 1930 All England singles championship, represent them at the European-American inter-regional finals held in Paris on the 18th, 19th, and 20th. However, Mr. Tilden refused the authorities' request because he had already signed a contract with a newspaper to write special reports on the inter-regional finals, which conflicted with the American Tennis Association's rule that a tennis player who has participated in a competition may not sign and send manuscripts to newspapers and magazines. However, this is only a problem for the European-American inter-regional competition. As for whether to attend the Chalenge tournament, it depends on Tilden's contract with the newspaper magazine. This can be decided as another problem.</p>

The outcome depended on the battle between Mr. Ota and Mr. Demurobu. At first, Mr. Ota made repeated mistakes, while Mr. Demurobu rested and waited. His strategy was to wait for Mr. Ota to defeat himself, and Mr. Ota never recovered, and was eventually defeated by Mr. Demurobu by a score of 3-0.

<p>A guest came from Beiping, and I asked him about things in the north. Are there any novelties recently? The guest said no. The guest was the director of the affiliated middle school of Fu Jen Catholic University in Beiping, so I asked again about the academic circles in the north. Are there any novelties? The guest said yes. He then described a marriage that could be used for conversation. (The following is what the guest said) A certain Mr. So-and-so, who teaches Party Ideology at our school, is from Hunan. He is also quite capable of fulfilling his duties in teaching methods and is full of new ideas. He often does things that are unexpected. His personality is also very humorous, so people like to associate with him. One day, he suddenly announced his wedding date and showed the address of the Huabei Grand Hotel. The guest, as a colleague, gave him a congratulatory couplet. On the scheduled day, the guest and the other guests arrived one after another. There were no banners or decorations in the hall. The two newlyweds were nowhere to be found. Some doubted and even said that he was attracting people by making excuses. Suddenly, Mr. So-and-so was seen leading his new wife by the hand, walking side by side and skipping happily. The so-called groom was still wearing his usual green woolen suit. The so-called bride was only wearing a black skirt, the standard clothing of women in academic circles. The man did not wear a flower on his lapel, and the woman did not wear a trailing veil. After bowing slightly to the crowd, they went on stage to give a speech. He said that their marriage was the newest style. No introducer was needed, and no officiant was needed, because their marriage came from free love. Why need an introducer? All the guests present know that they are married today, so what need is there for an officiant? Furthermore, they didn't change their usual clothes, and there were no temporary decorations. All the bothersome expenses were completely eliminated. Isn't this the newest style of marriage? Everyone laughed loudly and applauded. Some asked the bride to announce the story of their love. The bride spoke eloquently, saying: I am also from Hunan. I taught with him at a certain school in Hangzhou. We got along because of our compatible personalities. He loved me, and I loved him. We were very close. However, we never mentioned marriage. Soon after, he went to study in Tokyo. Another person tried to destroy our friendship. When he heard about it, he rushed back, eliminated the rival in love, and proposed to me. I agreed. However, it was not carried out. I returned to Hunan because my mother was ill, and when I went to Hangzhou again, he had disappeared. A year passed. I happened to come here to find a job, and we reunited. Now I can fulfill the marriage contract here. This is the short history of our love. The crowd laughed again. Later, the groom's former teacher was invited to give a speech. He said that their wedding today was the newest style and could be used as a model for social weddings, but it was still too troublesome. If it were my youth</p>

<p>When I wake up in the middle of the night, everything is silent. The tranquility is absolute. I hug the quilt and practice stillness. I feel my heart as clear as water, and all mundane thoughts disappear. At this time, every view and every thought can be thought-provoking. So-called Qingye Moxin, there is no one who does not understand everything thoroughly</p>
<p>When I wake up in the Qing night, I often think of the days when I am old and happy in the hall are limited. The pain of thinking of my parents is endless. Liao Eyu mourns, thinking of the cold heart can't help but cry sadly. Pillow was wet. Alas, time, time will not come again, anyone who is a son should share this word. (But the reward)</p>
<p>At the time of the marriage, it was unparalleled. Said that he had straightened his pants and then stepped down. The crowd laughed loudly. When the laughter subsided, the bride and groom disappeared again. It can be described as a unique wedding.</p>

<p>In areas where people's intelligence is closed, superstitious things appear in layers. If in civilized countries, the sayings of gods and ghosts are self-defeating. Only recently in Kansas City, America, KansasCity. Zheng Xuan Fu Mu Ma speaks, filling the city with wind and rain. This is also beyond the norm. In the early days, there was a harness company in Gansha City FosterHelnreichWagnerHarnssCo. A wooden horse stood in front of the door. When the company was booming, the horse seemed to represent the glorious era of horses. Da Shunqi every day. The company has been closed for many years.</p>
<p>Mr. J·J·Foste, General Manager of the Company, lives in retirement in his apartment on Weston Street. One. He happened to go to the small room on the roof of the building one day. The wooden horse stood there abruptly. He could not help but feel saddened. This once prominent wooden horse was abandoned in the pile of waste. He had not expected this at first. Life in old age is also like this. After a long time of sighing, Mr. Fu thought to himself: If the glorious era of this horse class is permanently stationed, how can the bright and splendid era of material civilization come? To comfort his grief. Therefore, he intends to give this ancient relic of historical value to Henry Ford, the creator of material civilization, so that it can be preserved in his Dearbern Museum. Ford agreed. Then he was transported to the hospital in a Ford truck as a souvenir of the transportation industry. When the wooden horse was transported onto the truck, the horse suddenly said to Mr. Fu. (Henry Ford made me fail. I should give me a place to live and hear that I will be sent to the museum, so I can rest easy from now on.) Mr. Fu was shocked. The incident gradually spread to nearby citizens and was shocked as a magic horse. News reporters from all over the world rushed to hear the news and regarded it as a rare piece of information. People in our country call things that have been around for a long time to become refined. This is what it means. The horse is gray and 16 hands high. The mane and tail are decorated with real horse hair. The skeleton is actually tied with paper, and the local citizens are accustomed to calling it Woodenhorse.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Records of the Turtle Face Also <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Recently, a friend came from Hangzhou. He said that in the Pingyao area not far from Hangzhou, a villager, Zhang, was fishing in the river and caught a turtle in the net. It looked different from ordinary turtles. Ordinary turtles have elliptical shells. This one is gourd-shaped. The front part is about an inch and a half wide, the back part is about three inches, and the middle is tightly bound. It is about five inches long and looks very much like a gourd. The entire shell is gold in color. The pattern is black. The so-called thirteen blocks are exactly thirteen gold coins. In the middle of the neck, there is also the word (six) with clear strokes. Looking at its abdomen, the shell is all white. There is. The navel is also something that ordinary turtles do not have. Other than that, the tail and feet are the same as ordinary turtles. Zhang regarded this strange turtle as the most precious thing and took it home to show his neighbors. Everyone said that they had never seen such a sight and praised it. For a time, many people from far and wide came to ask to see it. Zhang then either took it out</p>

<p>(7) Osaka's Beauty Seat</p>
<p>From Kobe to Osaka, the train takes one hour. Osaka is one of Japan's six major cities. The six major cities are Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, Nagoya, and Yokohama. Osaka is particularly the center of industry and commerce. Japan's largest industrial manufacturers and textile factories are concentrated here, making commerce very prosperous, first in Japan. The total population of the prefecture is 3,357,600, ranking second in the country and sixth in the world. Tokyo has the most, with 4,982,200 people (according to last year's report by the Japan Statistics Bureau). Osaka's streets are wide and clean, and the buildings are tall and magnificent. In the bustling city, there are many vehicles and pedestrians. When the reporter arrived in Osaka, it was almost dusk. Before long, ten thousand homes were illuminated with lights and electric lights, with red and green electric current advertisements everywhere. Transportation is even more convenient than in Shanghai, with trams running in all directions. For longer distances, one can take long-distance trams, which run every two minutes. Taxis can also be hired along the way. Within the city, regardless of distance, each ride costs one yen per day, so there are many taxis on the streets. It is very difficult for the police to maintain traffic. The congestion in front of the station is particularly severe, with a well-known police officer stationed there permanently, responsible for directing traffic. The officer's actions are almost frantic, gesticulating constantly, without a moment's rest. People stop when he signals them to stop, and proceed when he signals them to proceed, keeping order perfectly. Many people stop to watch. The reporter also stood for a few minutes, admiring his courage in performing his duties. Osaka and Tokyo are twelve hours apart by train. From April 1st of last year, Japan Air Transport Co., Ltd. started the Keihan Air Mail service, flying once every morning to carry passengers and mail, reaching the people in two hours, which is very convenient. The one-way fare is thirty yen, which is not much different from the first-class train fare, so business is very prosperous. Osaka has all kinds of entertainment venues, and the "Beauty Seat" is the most popular. The "Beauty Seat" is a variation of a coffee shop, with extremely beautiful young women as hostesses, providing tea, wine, and various other foods and drinks. Business hours are from 9:00 PM to 2:00 AM. The reporter visited once with Mr. Zeng Yanhua. Several male servants stand at the entrance, loudly inviting guests to enter, their duties similar to the turtle slaves in Shanghai. The interior is decorated elegantly and pleasantly, with bamboo frames covered with paper flowers and leaves, shaped realistically, and decorated with small green electric lights in between, making it even more luxurious. In the center, there is a small stage with scenery. At the corner of the stage, there is a radio broadcasting dance music, but you can't actually hold hands and dance. There are a dozen or so female hostesses, dressed gorgeously, with thick layers of face powder. They speak softly and gently. As soon as a guest arrives, they rush forward to sit beside them and provide attentive service, with warm and affectionate words that intoxicate people. The meal is mostly a few bottles of beer and a plate of broad beans, but the price is surprisingly high. Some linger for hours, unwilling to leave, because the drunkard's heart is not in the wine. Japanese women are extremely docile, treating their husbands like their second parents, never daring to resist in the slightest. They consider drinking and sensual pursuits to be natural and dare not interfere. Therefore, the business of the "Beauty Seat" is becoming increasingly prosperous. After several visits, one becomes a regular customer. Then, if you use clothes and accessories to win their favor, it is very easy to win their hearts. Countless Japanese men are addicted to the "Beauty Seat," wasting time and losing their jobs, which is a great disaster. The "Beauty Seat" is a specialty of Osaka. Recently, some have started to open in Ginza, Tokyo. On the day of opening, the threshold was broken. It is expected that after a few months, the prosperity will not be less than that of Osaka. The "Beauty Seat" business in Japan is still in its infancy.</p>
<p>Or not, they consider themselves rare commodities.</p>
<p>In Saigon, French Indochina, there is a huge zoo with a rich collection of birds, beasts, and aquatic animals, especially many strange creatures. There is a turtle with a triangular shell. One corner at the front is the head, and the two corners at the bottom are the two hind legs. The rest is the same as ordinary turtles. There is also a creature that looks like a turtle and a beast, huge and unparalleled. From a distance, it looks like a car. On closer inspection, it has a shell on its back like a turtle, and its head and feet also have similar features. This is what my friend Mr. Wu saw in Saigon. He told me about it when he returned.</p>
<p>In my Changtianning Temple, there is a release pond where turtles are released. Hundreds of them live together. The monks feed them twice a day. When it is time to feed them, the turtles are hidden at the bottom of the water. You only need to clap your hands a few times, and the turtles will hear the sound and compete to come to the surface, raising their heads to look at people, with tens of thousands of heads trembling, creating a spectacular sight. The food given is bran, which is sprinkled on the surface of the water. They compete to eat it like the five-colored big fish in the Jade Spring of West Lake. After eating, they sink again and disappear in an instant. Those who visit the temple and want to see the turtles only need to clap their hands to see them. The turtles know to eat when they hear the sound. They are spiritual creatures. However, sometimes they are played by people, which seems like people's intelligence backfiring on them.</p>
<p>I heard that someone in Wumen named Jia had suffered a series of misfortunes. A geomancer told his family that the feng shui of his father's tomb was not good, which had caused this. So they chose a site to move the tomb. When the tomb was opened, they found that water was stored under the coffin like a basin. Two turtles, golden in color, were resting in the water, their heads and feet retracted, like mandarin ducks sleeping soundly. Jia said, "This is a turtle's geomancy. It will definitely bring me good fortune in the future, but now is not the time." He quickly put the coffin back and covered it, keeping it intact. Later, Jia became even more unfortunate. People said that the earth's energy had been泄露, so it did not work. This is all superstitious talk, which is laughable to hear. However, it is strange how the two turtles were hidden under the coffin and why they regarded it as a paradise.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: Farewell Banquet, Plucking Flowers to Leave a Shadow, Famous Garden Gathering, Tea Tasting to See Beautiful姿</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen quickly took care of his daily official business in the morning. In a short while, the carriage was called. He and Long Ziyun went to Wei Chun Garden. It was already after seven o'clock, and the electric lights on the road were all lit. Of course, the electric lights decorating the garden were also brightly lit. At this time, there were slightly fewer tourists, because it was dinner time. Many tourists were preparing to come after they had eaten dinner. From eight to nine o'clock, it was the rush hour, so the people in charge of the garden were also taking turns eating. Those who lived nearby went home to eat and then came back. Originally, the Shanghai concession was called the commercial district in the eastern district and the residential district in the western district. There were several huge mansions in the Jing'an Temple area, including the mansion of a certain Grand Guardian that the garden owner knew. This Grand Guardian's wife also put a lot of effort into this international garden fair. The prize彩件 for the blessing tickets also came from the Grand Guardian's wife's dowry and were raised by her persuasion. She was originally a famous female philanthropist in Shanghai. She also converted to Buddhism and donated a lot of money to build Buddhist temples and provide alms to monks in places such as Hangzhou, Changzhou, and Shanghai, not a small amount. The Grand Guardian had six or seven sons and several daughters. The daughters were all going to attend this charity fair. The third and fourth daughters were about to get married, and the sixth and seventh daughters were still young. Each of them was a beautiful girl. Their sisters in the family were also numerous. They all came to this fair to fulfill their duties for a few days. Let's say that Zuo Shichen and Long Ziyun entered Wei Chun Garden, and it was like being on a road in Shanyin, where one was overwhelmed with the scenery. Zuo Shichen said, "We need to set a plan. Where do we go first and where do we go later?" Long Ziyun said, "Let's take a turn around each place first and get a general idea. Then we'll go and fill our stomachs. We can take advantage of the fact that there are fewer tourists at this time. The only problem is where do we go to eat dinner? We have to figure it out. For the sake of economy, we have to avoid the familiar and go for the unfamiliar. This is in response to a saying, 'hitting a familiar soap maker with a heavy plank.' As for how to play after dinner, we can decide while we are eating dinner." Zuo Shichen said, "Very good. Our grand strategy has been set, enough for a night of wandering." When you enter the door, you can't escape being surrounded by several little girls selling button flowers, and there is no reason to argue. After entering the door, they walked around everywhere. They saw a place with the four words "Fishing Game" written on it. Long Ziyun became curious and said, "What is this 'Fishing Game'? Let's go in and take a look." Who knew that as soon as they glanced at the door, they were spotted by the people inside, who said, "Mr. Long? Come in, come in." Long Ziyun and Zuo Shichen had no choice but to go in.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Gold Market Fluctuates and Remains Depressed <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Slight rise followed by a fall, ultimately returning to a state of decline. Yesterday, the 14th, the gold market resumed its downward trend, with the market conditions being chaotic and uncertain. Fluctuations of three or four taels were common, with hidden risks of six hundred taels or so. Throughout the day, there were eight or nine taels of fluctuations. The exchange rate had already shrunk by half a grade. The internal market was initially flat but then weakened. Banks occasionally made deposits and withdrawals. Selling pressure within the market was very strong, with Hengxing, Shengda, Bingxing, Zhifengyong, and Yongfeng all selling. Yongfeng, Fuchang, Yuanmao, and Yongfeng made frequent entries and exits. Dadecheng, Yuanxing, Yongyuan, Tai, and others bought in. Although the telegram from the big dealers earlier in the morning showed a decrease, due to the seizure by customs of a large amount of cash on a certain ship, the flow of cash was obstructed, and the price also eased. This caused the psychological anxiety of the industry, which was immediately stimulated and weakened, falling sharply by four or five taels. Later, buyers became active, and the exchange rate stabilized as banks absorbed funds. Suddenly, it soared by more than seven or eight taels, once rising to six hundred and four taels. At noon, it was still in a weak state, mainly because the selling pressure from Hengxing and others was overwhelming, and it fell again by four or five taels. The later market saw Fuchang, Yuancheng, and Yong advance and sell again. People's hearts were bad. Initially, it was still amicable, but then it became even more depressed, suddenly falling to five hundred and ninety-five taels. The changes in the market were unpredictable. The big silver dealers had no market yesterday (due to Monday).</p>
<p>Early in the morning, it was hit by the obstruction of cash. The opening gold price for August was only increased by seven qian to six hundred and two taels and four qian. Afterwards, Hengxing and others sold, and it gradually decreased, falling by more than five taels. The gross price was only ninety-seven taels. The exchange rate saw Sanjing absorbing cash, Dalian one tael and three qian four. Various banks did business with each other, with the US dollar for this month being thirty-six yuan and eight qian seven five. However, the British gold was sold by the Huashang Bank at sixpence one eight seven five for the near term. By the time the first order was announced, it had already shrunk by one two five, with the US dollar shrinking by two jiao five. When Japan added seven five, it was ninety-nine taels and two qian three fen. Next, because there seemed to be more buyers and Sanjing absorbed sixpence two five for August, it was increased to six hundred taels and zero qian seven fen. Suddenly, Hengxing and others sold a lot, falling by four taels in just over ten minutes, to ninety-six taels six qian seven fen. After ten o'clock, it gradually looked upward, and the exchange rate was flat. Huabi absorbed sixpence three one two five for September, resulting in hedging, and Yongfeng and others pursued it, causing the price to rise frequently by six or seven taels, reaching zero four taels beyond six hundred taels after eleven o'clock. However, Hengxing and others sold again and again, and the market was difficult to stabilize, falling again by five taels. By noon, the closing price was five hundred and ninety-eight taels and eight qian. The announced price was changed to six hundred and fifty-seven taels because the Japanese gold was large by seven five. Initially, it was fifty-eight nine taels, and later it was sixty taels, with the noon price suppressed by fifty-eight taels.</p>
<p>The closing price fell by five taels and nine qian. The opening price for the afternoon market was ninety-eight taels and five qian. Afterwards, there was a fluctuation of one or two taels. When it was reported that the Indian exchange rate was small, people's hearts were good, and it was calculated to be six hundred taels zero qian two fen. After entering, sellers crowded in and retreated by three taels. At two forty-five, it was ninety-seven taels and two qian. Suddenly, it was raised by two taels because the bank absorbed British gold sixpence three one two five for September, and the current Japanese gold was納進 one tael three qian three fen five six two five by Sumitomo, so at three o'clock it was nine taels two qian. Afterwards, Fuchang and other big players sold off. The first order was also strong, and people's hearts panicked, so it dropped by four taels, almost collapsing. At four o'clock, it was ninety-five taels and three qian, and in a moment it returned to one tael and several qian, for a total of seven taels and one qian. After the zero accounts chased in, it was still weak. At four thirty, the closing price was five hundred and ninety-five taels and nine qian, a decrease of five taels and eight qian compared to last Saturday. The maximum price for the two markets was six hundred and four taels, and the minimum price was five hundred and ninety-five taels and three qian, a difference of eight taels and seven qian. The announced price was sixty taels, with the July book at ninety-seven taels, August at ninety-nine taels, water replenishment at ninety-seven taels, and the afternoon at ninety-four taels.</p>
<p>Industry peers tend to short. Although the transactions of each number are active, short positions dominate. The total purchases of Yuda, Fuxingyong, Yuancheng Yong, Yuanxingyong, Yongfeng, Dadecheng, Taikangrun, Yuantai, and Yongchengchang. Hengxing, Bingxing, Wanxing, Shunli, Zhifengyong, and Chengfengyong all sold. Fuchangyuanmaoyong, Senchangyong, etc. came in and out from time to time. In the afternoon, Fuchang, Yuancheng, and Yong purchased and sold first. Wanxing, Yuankangxiang, Dakang, slightly entered. Hengxing, Zhifengyong, Yuancheng, Yuantai, Xieyu, etc. all sold. The Dalian gang's attitude was mediocre as usual, with sales of eight or nine hundred strips and purchases of over six hundred strips. The Guanggang sold several thousand strips, and the swap is still in hiding. However, according to yesterday's market, the shorts should have to pay, but it is impossible to predict the sudden changes in the market.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Exchange Rate Apparently Tight, Secretly Loose <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's exchange rate had already shrunk by half a grade, with British gold shrinking by one two five to one shilling fivepence eight seven five, the US dollar shrinking by two five to thirty-six yuan two five, India shrinking by half a yuan to one hundred rupees two five, and Japan shrinking by half a yuan to ninety盾. The German exchange rate decreased by two yuan and a half, to one hundred and fifty-one马克 half. The French Franc shrunk by seven yuan to nine hundred and twenty yuan. The Singaporean exchange rate added one tael, to one hundred and fifty-five taels and a half. The Japanese gold added seven five, to one tael three qian six fen two five. Hong Kong was still calculated at eighty-five taels, because the big silver dealers had shrunk back yesterday. The internal market was firm in the morning but weakened later, and then it was flat. In the afternoon, it trended to looseness because the gold price suddenly showed a downward trend, and it has broken into six hundred taels. In fact, it was转良爲莠 by the strict prohibition of exports, and the outlet was obstructed, which was stimulating. The closing price compared to last Saturday saw the first order increase by one two five, the US dollar increase by two five, and the Japanese gold decrease by one fen. This is the apparent tightness and secret looseness. People's hearts are unsettled. Huashang speculators once sold one hundred thousand pounds of British gold, which was absorbed by Sanjing, Huabi, Sumitomo, Datong, Maijia, etc. There were also tens of thousands of pounds to settle, and Hefeng, Shanghai, and Great Britain sold a little. Various banks also did tens of thousands of pounds of business with each other, and also did one or two hundred thousand US dollars. The Huashang rarely made deposits or withdrawals, but sold tens of thousands of yuan of cash in Dalian, which was purchased by Sanjing and Sumitomo. The Japanese exchange rate transaction was sluggish, and the market conditions were mediocre.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Interest Rates in Shrewd Trend <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The market situation from last week to the present, 洋厘 rates have been soft in the morning and firm at noon, and the difference is particularly large, always between one厘, almost becoming a fixed habit. However, the reason for the rotation is that there must be a considerable balance in the 汇头轧抵 every night among industry peers, and there are bills received, so the supply is relatively strong, and people's hearts are soft. In the afternoon market, the客路銷胃 is still very strong, and the use is very strong. Although there is a large supply, there are still concerns that it is insufficient, so it seems to be firm and shrewd again. However, the source is lacking, and the 胃 is暢旺. The current situation must have a day when the water is exhausted and the mountains are exhausted. Therefore, the 厘 price finally盘高.</p>
<p>厘拆 prices (洋厘, the supply side was very brave in the early market, and people's hearts were疏滯. As a result, the closing厘 price was three 毫 seven忽半 smaller than the previous noon, which was seven qian two fen six 厘 eight 毫 seven 忽半. The buying atmosphere was rekindled in the afternoon market, and there were many transactions. The 厘 price 黱 at the close was seven qian two fen seven 厘 half, which was six 毫 two 忽 half higher than the early market. (Silver拆) The silver situation was very shrewd yesterday because the进出差额 was very complicated on Monday, and the 头衬 was often lacking. Both the morning and noon markets were one qian five fen, which was five fen higher than the previous day's early market. The 划头 added eight fen to the water, and the bank's posted price was six fen.</p>
<p>Auxiliary coin market: no one asked about the Jiangnan small ocean coins, and the price did not move and there were no transactions. The original posted market price was six qian three fen, the same as the previous day. Guangdong small ocean coins rose consistently, with both the morning and noon markets at six qian one fen three 厘 half, one厘 better than the previous day's noon market. The amount of transactions was 165,000角 in the early market and 35,000角 in the noon market. Copper coins rose by one thousand 文 to three hundred and eighty-seven thousand 文.</p>
<p>Silver ocean coins进出 (Silver 款) Yesterday, the banks received and remitted a lot because it was Monday. The Huashang received and remitted two hundred and seventy-eight million, and the foreign banks received and remitted two hundred and fifty-six million. The specific expenditure was more than 500,000, settlement was two hundred and seventy-eight million, and various goods, exchange, taxes, and miscellaneous款 receipts totaled eleven million.进仓 900,000, 出仓 500,000. Japanese banks received and remitted various款 5,340,000,进仓 500,000. Money changers' and silver public's individual receipts were more than 46.6 million. 划头款 receipts were more than 4.5 million. The receipt of remittance款 from various roads was more than 1.3 million, and the solution was 1 million. (Foreign 款) The exchange 划票款 was 1.385 million in the early market and 1.65 million in the noon market. Banknotes were 40,000 in the early market and 25,000 in the noon market.中山 new coins were 168,000 in the early market and 75,000 in the noon market.场外 banknotes were 150,000 in the early market and 112,000 in the noon market. Cash was 240,000 in the early market and 60,000 in the noon market. The banks' buying and selling was 530,000 in the early market and 450,000 in the noon market. The receipts and remittance of foreign accounts of various banks was more than 2.8 million, the banknotes进出 was more than 1.89 million, the money changers' and foreign public's individual receipts were more than 6.5 million, the foreign 划头款 receipt was more than 3.3 million, the拆借 foreign款 was more than 2.2 million, the small money changers' receipts and exchanges of banknotes was 890,000, and the new currency remittance heads sold was more than 1 million.</p>
<h3 id="e109">New Coin Exports Uninterrupted <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, it reached more than 1.8 million again</p>
<p>Since the Guangzhou financial community experienced a bank run the previous week, no effort has been spared in planning the 現 款. According to estimates, the amount shipped out of Shanghai was only 10 million, which was transported by the related banks and exchange houses together, with untold 暗耗 in transit. However, in order to maintain the market, it is not a pity. It is now heard that the 厘 price in that port is also increasing sequentially, offsetting the shipments from Shanghai, and there will not be a major loss. Therefore, the shipments have been more courageous recently, and the Shanghai port still does not exceed 2.5厘. Therefore, those who are engaged in this industry can still make a small profit if they are diligent and precise. As a result, purchases and shipments are becoming more畅, and yesterday's shipments actually amounted to more than 1.8 million. Also, 100,000 British silver dollars were shipped from Hong Kong, priced at seven qian five fen two厘 half. However, the banknote market, after the large-scale收羅 of現洋 new coins, was fundamentally affected, so every time there is a transaction, there is always a reduction of 125 to 2毫 half. Yesterday, it was still a 1875譜. If the banknotes are compared with the new coins, the difference is actually about three厘.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the security market and various government bonds had many types offered, but only 23,400 yuan were transacted. Futures trading was also slightly quiet, with more than 6.2 million yuan transacted in the upper and lower afternoons. The bond market was as calm as before, and the market's sentiment was greatly stabilized. Bond prices rotated and trended steadily, and this calm situation has only been seen in recent weeks. Compared with the previous day, the rises and falls offset each other, but the number was only about four or five角. In addition, because the weather has been gradually getting hotter recently, in order to facilitate the handling of affairs, only one盘 of transactions will be made in the afternoon from yesterday onwards, and the period is tentatively set for five weeks.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Cotton Yarn Market Turns Around <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The US cotton three products rebounded fiercely... the yarn mills reduced the sound of labor again and the yarn market returned to firmness. The imaginary air of the previous day was slightly suffocated, and the real one was that the US cotton came back out of the corner and added three cents to the mouth and the three types of yarn increased sharply by six or seven yuan. The hearts of the people were shocked and the buying increased, and the Hengda manufacturers still did not relax their minds. At the end of the month, they bought long-term months, and the Yihe factory had continued to reduce labor. Therefore, the market was even tighter. However, the actual sales were weak. The yarn market may be calm for the time being, but the majority of psychology is low.</p>
<p>People bid for the future more firmly. At the beginning of the market, the US cotton rose slightly, and the sellers in the market lacked. After the three types of yarn tended to rise, each month increased by one, three, five, six, and seven cents. In the afternoon, the market was still tight, and the three types of yarn rose again by one, two, and four cents. Yu Kang bought 1,100 bales for the most. Sen Kang, Gong Tai, Li Chang, Yu Da, Tai Xing, Da Feng, and Yi Yu bought between 350 and 750 bales. The sellers were Da Ji, Zhen Da, Yi Cheng, Tian Chang, He Shen, and Tian Jiang, with 250 to 500 bales. The total transaction volume for the day was 10,600 bales. The following is the closing price of the 人標 on the left</p>

<p>New cotton development is feared to be affected... people are optimistic</p>
<p>The cotton market has turned up, the situation is stable and calm, and the actual US cotton has risen again, and the market has settled. The weather in this port is cloudy and the wind is strong, and it is deeply feared that the development of new cotton will be affected. However, the time is still early and the relationship is weak. The general has a optimistic heart and expects the US cotton to rise. Therefore, the market is tight. In the afternoon, the three types of cotton suddenly rose by 1.5 yuan, and the outer Hanbiao's previous market buying was very strong, and each rose by 1, 2, and 3 qian. However, the Hanbang sold it. In the afternoon, the market was still tight. The Japanese merchants bought again, and it rose by 5 qian. The near month alone fell by 5 qian. Bought from Xingyuan, Tongxing, Taichang, Changfeng, Maoji, and Tianchang 4,100担 to 400担. Sold by He Shen 2,300担 for the most. Gong Tai, Da Ji, Da Chang, Cheng Xin, Jie Tong Xing, Da Feng Yuan Da 500担 to 2,100担. The total transaction volume for the day was 28,600担.

<p>Amidst the political instability in Bombay, there is one comforting phenomenon: the strong demand from European manufacturers for Pingguole and Aomula cotton. At the same time, there are also numerous inquiries from the Far East regarding various types of Indian cotton. Rainfall in the cotton-growing regions is suitable, and the central provinces need warm and sunny weather. Planting has been almost completed everywhere, and the cotton is developing. The statistics for the past week are attached below (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>Previous Week Last Week</p>
<p>Accumulated Receipts since September 1st 3,225 3,384</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory 1,089 1,094</p>
<p>Accumulated Exports since September 1st 2,445 2,266</p>
<p>Exports to Europe 801 806</p>
<p>Exports to China 320 372</p>
<p>Exports to Japan 1,270 1,130</p>
<p>Exports to Other Regions 54 58</p>
<p>Spot demand in Liverpool was calm last week, and futures showed no improvement. The figures in the US cotton government report were close to expectations, so it was not affected in the slightest. Currently, India and its counterparts have a considerable intention to import, but with favorable weather for US cotton, market conditions are still difficult to develop. The Egyptian cotton market is quiet and firm.</p>
<h3 id="e115">The Grain and River-Bottom Rice Market Is Quiet <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, no boats arrived at the port via the waterway, and transactions in this street were even more scarce. The North Japonica rice from factories and warehouses has been registered by the authorities, but an agreement on evaluation and sale per peck has not been reached by both parties, making it difficult to proceed with the evaluation. The sales of Xiang rice and other varieties are completely sluggish. Although there is still a small amount of stock at the river bottom, there is little trading due to a lack of buyers. The wholesale price for top-quality rice is between 20.05 and 20.06 yuan, and the trend of converting to yuan is weak, with all sales being sluggish. There were a few sales per peck throughout the day at a high price of 19.78 yuan.</p>
<p>Hunan in Shanghai: There were few arrivals from the river bottom, and the buying interest in this street was very weak. North Japonica rice was extremely scarce, and the price was limited to a high of 21 yuan. Small amounts of thin Southern Indica rice were also being sold as needed. After the price of foreign rice rose firmly, the trend of Xiang rice became slightly more active, with the price settling at around 20 yuan. While conversion was not strong, reports from the waterways were calm, leading to a lack of interest from restaurants and taverns. The market sentiment was weak, but the price here still needs to be around 19 yuan. The sales of Yin yuan (silver dollars) were dull and sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Foreign Rice Drops Back by a Few Cents in the Afternoon <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the price of foreign rice initially rose by four or five cents due to the jump in prices of various types of rice the day before, creating optimism. However, the previous rise after the fall was due to local merchants who found the small price increase worthwhile and made some inquiries. Furthermore, with the complete arrival of foreign rice orders, sentiment inevitably increased, and prices rose. However, traders from Huai'an again felt the price was too high and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Many speculators, seeing a chance to profit, rushed to sell off their inventories, and the market could not sustain the gains for long. In the afternoon, the price fell by about one cent. Total transactions were also weak, only around 5,000 bags. There were over 4,000 bags of brown rice, priced at 16.75 to 16.5 yuan for small sizes, 16.95 yuan for extra-high quality, 15.3 to 15.4 yuan for large sizes, 14.78 yuan for red large sizes, 17.35 yuan for Kagai rice, 14.9 yuan for Min dang brown rice, and 14.1 to 13.9 yuan for small-sized brown rice from Qieladi, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Flour Market Increased Again Yesterday <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Exchange Suspended Afternoon Trading Due to the Hot Weather</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the flour market initially remained weak and sluggish. Subsequently, the price of foreign wheat was reported to be slightly better, and sentiment turned upward. Although actual sales were not brisk at the moment, factory inventories had not been sufficiently replenished due to the difficulty in purchasing wheat. Although the bulls, both internal and external, wanted to maintain high prices, they ultimately felt that the actual situation was not favorable, so they had to gradually cover their positions. As a result, prices for all near-term months increased. Long-term prices were relatively stable. Observing this, if sales do not improve, there should be no problems for this month; otherwise, a slight increase may be necessary. As a result, this month's price increased by 1.75 cents compared to the end of the previous week. Prices for August and September each increased by 1.5 cents, October increased by 1.25 cents, November increased by 1 cent, and December increased by 0.25 cents.</p>
<p>The flour exchange has temporarily suspended afternoon trading for one week due to the extreme heat. The trading sessions have been increased to six in the morning. Future arrangements will be determined based on the weather conditions.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Futures Wheat Rises and Then Retreats <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market initially showed signs of rebounding in all months after the morning opening. This was due to the slight improvement in the price of foreign wheat and the sharp decline at the end of the previous week, which greatly stimulated speculation. As a result, prices in all months rose gradually, generally recovering by about four or five cents compared to the end of the previous week. However, when trading resumed in the afternoon, many large domestic bull traders took advantage of the tense sentiment to sell off their positions. The most active selling came from the Wuxi group. Factories also put slight pressure on the market. As a result, sentiment turned weak, retreating by two or three cents compared to the morning. In the end, July and September were each up by two cents, August, November, and December were up by one cent, and October was up by three cents. The spot wheat market was generally rejecting each other, intentionally suppressing prices, and unwilling to allocate high prices due to poor flour sales. As a result, prices in all segments were slightly sluggish. For example, Henan stale wheat has opened low at five taels. More than 3,000 bags of new wheat, such as those from Yaowan, Zhumadian, Shashi, and Hankou, were handled by Fuxin, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e119">New Jiujiang Yellow Soybeans Arrive and Are Received <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Soybeans: Recently, the soybean situation has not been very smooth. This is because the Dalian production market reported a shortage, and new yellow soybeans from Jiangxi continued to arrive. As a result, sales in this port have been poor, and prices have remained flat due to sellers lowering prices, unable to pass a repair. Yesterday, Dalian Yuan soybeans opened at around six taels. A total of over 1,000 bags of Jiujiang Chengmengzi, Duchangzi, and Three Sheep were opened at a high price of six taels and five taels and nine qian.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake: The futures cake market fluctuated considerably yesterday. The morning opening was very firm because there were buyers making inquiries. July briefly reached two taels and nine cents. The afternoon opening saw the price drop sharply by one and a half cents due to bulls selling off and the Dalian market weakening. Subsequently, trading became more active, and spot sales remained acceptable, so the closing price recovered by about one cent. As a result, it was similar to the end of the previous week.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated and White Sugar Again Announce Price Increases <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Sugar Stabilized</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was no telegram from the sugar market production area regarding Cuban spot sugar or New York futures sugar. The prices of Java futures and spot sugar did not rise or fall. According to the association's pricing, coarse granulated and white sugar were quoted higher at seven taels and eight and a half qian due to limited market inventory, but buying interest remained quiet, with occasional inquiries. However, sellers did not sell at the offered price of seven taels and eight qian, leading to a stalemate. Transactions for medium granulated and white sugar were also quiet. Japanese sugar sales were scattered, with YRO mark at seven taels, nine qian, and two and a half fen, YT mark at eight taels and seven and a half fen, and YP mark at eight taels and three qian. The market situation was stable.</p>

<p>The first batch of New Gold Mountain branches arrived a few days ago, totaling over one hundred boxes. It was heard yesterday that all of them had been opened. High-quality Yuan branches were opened at twenty-four and five taels, followed by twenty-one and two taels. There were also a few boxes of special-grade branches, opened at a high price of about two taels, but the quantity was very small and cannot be regarded as the regular market. Flat branches of terminal grade were priced at nearly twenty taels. The second batch also arrived yesterday and can continue to be opened today, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market in this port became even more sluggish. This was because overseas markets such as the United States, France, England, and India are experiencing unusually hot summers this year. Silk weaving factories have uniformly suspended operations, and there is no discussion about raw silk. Silk telegrams are not being relayed, and European firms are becoming increasingly disinterested. Silk sales are becoming increasingly sluggish. Yesterday, the market for both futures and spot silk was virtually stagnant, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this port showed a slight shift in the overall trend. Yesterday, the Russian Cooperative Association formally began trading in Taoyuan black tea from Hunan Province. A total of 1,000 to 2,000 boxes were negotiated for the entire city, with prices ranging from 35.6 to 43.4 taels. It was also heard that they had selected thousands of boxes of Qimen black tea for procurement. In the green tea market, Zhen Mei and Xiu Mei varieties are in high demand among British and French merchants. Market inventories are low, and tea prices are expected to rise. High-quality Zhen Mei teas are sold as soon as they arrive, but medium- and low-quality teas are still ignored, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Cotton Cloth Continues to Rise by About Five Cents <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The local factory cotton cloth market is showing improvement, especially cotton cloth. This is mainly because the sales of dyed cloth are increasing significantly. Dealers from Sichuan and Wuhan are constantly sending telegrams to purchase Haichang cloth and Indanthrene blue cloth. As a result, brands such as Twelve-Pound Lucky Trumpet and Tong Caiqiu are sold out as soon as they are produced. In addition, after the Jin Gui turmoil occurred in Dalian, Niuzhuang, and Yingkou, Eastern goods have been rising steadily, and they are also rushing to purchase local factory cotton cloth in Shanghai. This kind of popularity is truly rare in recent years. Yesterday, the prices of various brands rose by about five cents again, and cotton twill was also firm. 200 pieces were traded with dealers from Shantou and other parts of Guangdong. Coarse cloth is difficult to rise in price due to the abundant inventory, with about 30,000 pieces stored in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Market Conditions for Eastern and Western Piece Goods Are Chaotic (Eastern Goods) are no longer as popular as before, mainly because it is the off-season and purchases by merchants are weak. In addition, the goods ordered for July and August have been arriving in Shanghai one after another, resulting in an oversupply. Yesterday, cotton velvet fell again. Fuhua bright red and Tu Bai were sold for 1 qian, 8 fen, and 7.5 li. Feise was sold for 7 fen and 7 li. The price of Da Bing Zhong Rui Yuehua velvet and black patterned velvet also fell by about 2.5 li. Lan Tiao Se Ting, which had been sluggish for a long time, suddenly became active yesterday after a long period of quiet, with over 30 pieces traded in this street. Zi Zhongshan was sold for 1 qian and 6 fen. Si Xueshi was sold for 1 qian, 5 fen, and 7.5 li. Zhigong ni and Zhigong satin are still out of stock and continue to be firm. (Western Goods) Yuanxi satin has been heavily sought after by the Yangtze River dealers in recent days. Yesterday, Lun Zhaoyun was sold for 3 qian and 6 fen. Gong Mao Qiao Zhongqiao was sold for 5 qian, 1 fen, and 5 li, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Typhoon in This Port Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Since entering the summer, the weather in this port has been hot, with thermometers often exceeding 90 degrees. However, the day before yesterday evening, the clouds in the sky moved very quickly, and a cool breeze gradually rose in the evening, mixed with light rain, suggesting signs of a typhoon. The summer heat dissipated as a result. Yesterday morning, a strong wind blew, with incessant whistling sounds. The tide in the Huangpu River rose sharply by several feet. The Customs flag station in Lujiazui, Pudong, received a report from the observatory stating that the typhoon was approaching rapidly from the Wenzhou waters in a northwesterly direction, appearing to be heading towards Shanghai. Therefore, at 10 a.m., it hoisted a black warning ball and simultaneously fired a warning shot to warn all shipping companies in this port that exports should temporarily stop anchoring to avoid danger. As a result, all shipping companies' exports were temporarily blocked yesterday. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 4 p.m. yesterday, the typhoon had landed in the Wenzhou area and turned north, now located at latitude 29 degrees and longitude 120 degrees, i.e., between Wenzhou and Ningbo. Its center point is about 30 li in length and width and is moving very quickly. If the wind direction does not change, it will pass several tens of li west of Shanghai. If it tilts slightly eastward, Shanghai will bear the brunt, it is said.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there were no accidents involving ships on the river surface due to the Customs' warning. Many buildings on land and residents' glass windows were shattered. The roof of the baseball viewing platform in the racecourse was also blown away in one corner. Many trees on both sides of the roads in western Shanghai were broken. It was truly a rare typhoon this year.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Seawall in Baoshan Is in Danger <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Please Allocate a Large Sum of Money Quickly for Emergency Repairs</p>
<p>The entire seawall in Baoshan County, northeast of the Wusong Fort and Taiwan, is related to the lives and property of the counties of Shanghai, Baoshan, Jiading, and Taicang. In recent days, sudden typhoons have occurred outside the Wusongkou, and the sea tide has risen sharply, accompanied by turbulent waves and towering white waves. As a result, the embankments along the east-west sides of the seawall have been washed away by the raging tide for about several hundred zhang. Wang Yizhong, the director of the Jiangnan Embankment Engineering Office, upon hearing this, immediately went to the seawall with several engineers to conduct an on-site inspection. The number of dangerous sections and the required engineering costs are detailed below: (1) The entire section of dangerous works from Wuyuedun, Pilian, and Beiwang Temple in Xitang is 276 zhang long. Among them, the foundation of 135 zhang of the embankment has collapsed, the embankment has been eroded, and only four or five feet of the embankment surface remain. It is in danger of collapsing and requires an estimated cost of over 97,000 yuan. (2) The east and west wing walls of the seawall connected to both ends of the Shidong Bridge are 1 zhang and 1 chi high. The east wing is 1 zhang and 4 chi long, and the west wing is 1 zhang and 7 chi long, with a total estimated cost of 2,500 yuan. (3) The foundation stones on the north and south sides of the outer mouth of the Shidong Bridge have all collapsed, with a length of about 15 zhang. It is the most important thing to protect Shidong and requires an estimated cost of 8,000 yuan. (4) Restoring all the foundation stone earthwork will require an estimated cost of over 39,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e128">All Sea Vessels Were Suspended Yesterday Due to the Typhoon <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a typhoon occurred in this port, and coastal merchant ships were all blocked from leaving. The suspension of each route and the accidents of merchant ships are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ningbo Ships Suspended: The Shanghai-Ningbo scheduled ships Taikoo and Ningshao were suspended once during the big wind that occurred last Monday when the Xin Beijing and Xin Ningshao ships were suspended once. Until yesterday, after the two ships came to Shanghai from Ningbo and unloaded their cargo and passengers, they received a notice from the Jianghai Customs stating that a typhoon had occurred in this port. The wind in the Wenzhou waters was the strongest. Coastal merchant ships should stop exporting and take shelter in the port to show seriousness. Taikoo Ningshao immediately ordered Xin Beijing and Xin Ningshao to stay in Shanghai and stop leaving, stop loading cargo, and stop selling passenger tickets. More than a thousand passengers who arrived at the ship temporarily returned.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Sea Ships Stop: Zhoushan ship on the Shanghai-Taiwan line and Shengli ship on the Xiangshan line were all scheduled to depart from Shanghai before 5 p.m. yesterday. According to the usual practice, the time limit must not be wrong. Yesterday afternoon, the cargo and passengers of each ship had boarded the ship and waited for export. Because the Customs issued a warning, each ship did not dare to drive rashly and planned to move to the Wusongkou anchorage and wait for departure when the wind subsided slightly in the evening. In addition, the Zhaoshang Bureau's Hai'an ship also took shelter from the wind and repaired the wireless equipment on the ship. It was changed to export today.</p>
<p>Two Foreign Ships Aground: The Yifeng ship of the Yichang class of the Jiang Company in this port, which came to Shanghai from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, imported yesterday. When the ship arrived at the Huangpu River and reached the river surface at the Bund of the Waibaidu Bridge, it happened to be the time when the wind and waves in the Huangpu River were large. The ship's hull was unable to control itself due to the impact of the waves and ran aground in front of the Bund Garden. A barge was also crushed. The company received the news and quickly sent a small ship to tow it. After more than two hours, it was towed out of the shoal. In addition, the Zhagen ship of the Zhawa Company in this port received a telegram. The company's Zhigen ship was on its way from Shanghai to Dalian and ran aground outside Dalian Bay due to a big wind. It is now sending a ship to rescue it.</p>
<p>Ships Coming to Shanghai Take Shelter from the Wind: In addition to the Luoyang Maru and Xianghe ships from the Yangtze River, most of the ships coming to Shanghai from the outer sea failed to arrive at the port and anchored outside Wusong to take shelter from the wind, such as the British ship Sha Bi Ding and the German ship Gu Sila. All took shelter from the wind on the way. In addition, the Zhaoshang Bureau's Jiahe ship came from Min to Shanghai and is currently sailing to Fuyang Island to take shelter from the wind. The Guangli ship came to Shanghai from Guangdong, carrying 1,000 unarmed soldiers, and was originally scheduled to land at Nangaogang Temple in Shanghai today. Yesterday, due to the typhoon on the way, it took shelter from the wind in Ningbo and did not leave. There are more than a dozen other ships that were blocked on various islands and failed to reach Shanghai, it is said.</p>
<p>Sampans Also Stopped: The small sampan boats in the river carried many passengers to and from. After receiving the big wind warning yesterday, they all sailed to various river branches and wharf berths in advance and stopped. The cargo barges did not leave due to the suspension of the sea ships and the huge wind and waves in the Huangpu River. All Jianglun loading and unloading of goods were changed to large iron barges to transport them carefully. From the afternoon of yesterday, the barges, sampans, and small steamers sailing in the Huangpu River were almost completely suspended. In this turbulent wave, a port famine appeared. This is truly a rare event in Shanghai, and most of the towed barges, small steamers, and civilian ships that were suspended sailed to the Suzhou River to take shelter from the wind.</p>

<p>French Overseas Chinese Hold Celebration</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the French Democratic Republic. In the early morning, the French Consul-General, Mr. Gan Gelin, and the French military commander in Shanghai went to Gujiazhai Park to hold a military parade. At 8 o'clock, Mr. Fei Woli, the Police Superintendent of the French Concession Police, led the Chief Inspector, Mr. Pu Yan, and the heads and deputy heads of various police stations, and Chinese and Western detectives on duty, to the French Consulate on the Bund to congratulate Mr. Gan Gelin, the French Consul-General. They waited in the square in front of the consulate for the French Consul to hold a flag-raising ceremony. At 11 o'clock, they received congratulations in the main reception room of the French Consulate. The consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai, such as Britain, the United States, and Japan, and the representatives of various Chinese military and political organs, etc., the judges of the French Public Concession, Zhu Gongtang, and Mr. Du Yuesheng, the Chinese consultant of the French Consulate, the Chinese director of the Ministry of Industry, the members of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the French Concession taxpayers' association, were all present. Mr. Gan Gelin, the French Consul-General, Mr. Ju Lan, the Zheng Consul, Mr. Zhang Wenbin, the translator, and Mr. Yin Yin warmly received them with champagne and refreshments. At 12 o'clock, they shook hands and said goodbye with great interest. At that time, the roads outside the consulate and the Bund were busy with traffic, which was very prosperous for a while. However, the French Park celebration and entertainment in the evening were stopped due to fears that a typhoon would occur and cause danger. The various kinds of news heard yesterday are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Prisoner Relief: The French Concession Court has a tradition of prisoner relief every French Democracy Memorial Day. On the day before yesterday, the judge Zhu, together with Mr. Ju Lan, the French consul, drove to the prison on Xuehuali Road to ascend to the public seat. The prison head presented the list of prisoners to the case, which was reviewed by the Chinese and Western officials, and thirty-six prisoners who obeyed the law and worked diligently were selected for release, and the sentences of thirty-three prisoners were reduced to show compassion. The prisoners kowtowed and thanked them before leaving.</p>
<p>Suspension of Trial: The French Concession Court suspended the hearing of criminal cases in the morning and the civil court sessions in the afternoon due to the French National Day. According to the usual practice, the Chinese and Western officials notified the Criminal Section of the French Police Department and the Public Hall Prosecutor's Office to suspend the transfer of civil and criminal trivial cases for one day, and hung Chinese and French flags on the front door of the office to extend congratulations together.</p>
<p>Promotion: Mr. Fei Woli, the Police Superintendent of the French Police Department, specially promoted Du Wenbin, Cheng Haitao, and Yang Shansong, the translators of the Political Department, by one grade in commemoration of the country's democracy. Bao Tan, Fan Guangzhen, Wei Yuansheng, and Wang Danting were also promoted by one grade.

<h3 id="e130">French Water and Electricity Factory Damaged Underground Water Pipes Yesterday <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>It Is Said That It Will Take Tonight to Repair</p>
<p>At about 1:35 a.m. yesterday, the French water and electricity factory's water pipes at three locations, namely, the west end of Bansongyuan Road and Lujiabang Pubei Road in Nanshi, and in front of the water company's gate, suddenly burst at the same time, with the explosion at Bansongyuan being the most violent. It is estimated that a water pipe with a diameter of 12 inches and a length of about 12 feet was destroyed, and the road was destroyed for about 10 feet. Suddenly, the ground was flooded to a depth of one foot, and the shops and residences in the nearby area were turned into a swamp. The Second District General Office immediately sent a telegram to the General Office to notify the company. At dawn, the company sent a Western engineer and eight Russian workers, accompanied by Gao Xun, an official of the Second District, with many police officers, to investigate. Fortunately, there were a total of three main water pipes in the area. They immediately closed the main faucet of the damaged pipe and thoroughly investigated the cause of the damage. Therefore, the Chinese trams from Laoximen to Gaochang Temple could only drive to the Local Court and turn around. The trams running from Xiaodongmen to Gaochang Temple could only reach Xuejiabang. Until 10 a.m., after the water had completely receded, it was restored. According to the engineer, it would take at least tonight to repair. As for the other two locations, there was no major problem, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e131">News of the Labor Unrest at the French Water and Electricity Factory Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Xiao Zhengfa, a worker at the French water and electricity workers' union, was injured in the wrist by a Westerner from the company for preventing new workers from repairing water pipes. He was taken to the Public Security Bureau by the Second District Police Station for questioning. The labor union immediately requested the Municipal Party Department to approve his release on bail so that he could receive treatment. The circumstances have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that although Xiao was granted permission by the Public Security Bureau to be released after a brief interrogation, he was sent to court again at 8 a.m. yesterday. The labor union, upon hearing this, immediately dispatched four representatives, Zhu Xingeng, Jiang Ayou, Zhang Amao, and Xu Changgen, to report to the Municipal Party Department at 10 a.m. After Tao Baichuan received them, he immediately sent Mao Tongsheng to the Local Court to negotiate. As a result, they agreed to release him on bail. The labor union will go to bail him out this morning. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau sent armed police officers to protect the company to repair water pipes. The workers were greatly angered upon hearing this, thinking that since the Chinese officials recognized that the French merchants had not registered with the Chinese authorities, there was no need to protect them. Furthermore, they have repeatedly maintained the French merchants in repairing the water pipes. When will the victory of the strike be achieved? Therefore, they specially convened a temporary discussion meeting and will go to the Municipal Party Department at 9 a.m. today to petition, state everything, and request relief.</p>
<p>Over Sixty Labor Unions Jointly Petition to Organize a Support Association for the Strike by Workers of the French Water and Electricity Factory. The Xiangsheng Iron Factory Workers' Union is not only making every effort to help but also raising donations to subsidize them. It is heard that they have already raised fifty silver dollars and handed them over to the water and electricity workers' union. The remaining funds will continue to be raised. The striking workers were very grateful for the enthusiasm of the Xiangsheng Workers' Union, it is said.</p>

<p>Reply to a Letter from Over Forty Trade Associations in the City</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Jiqing, the new chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, replied yesterday to a letter from over forty trade associations in the city, stating his reasons for resigning. His original letter stated: "To the esteemed gentlemen of the Shanghai National Medicine Trade Association and forty other associations, I respectfully reply: Having read the reports in the city's newspapers of the 14th regarding your letter to me, Xu Jiqing, with earnest expectations and deep admonitions, I am filled with trepidation. My refusal to assume the chairmanship of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is not, as your esteemed letter suggests, a feigned modesty for high praise. I stated on the spot that I would still serve as a committee member, hoping to follow the other committee members and contribute to some extent. However, I believe I am not capable enough to hold the chairmanship, fearing that my limited abilities would lead to inadequacy in the future. As for your esteemed letter stating that I would fail to live up to the expectations of all the merchants in the city, I feel even more guilty. Therefore, despite the repeated and sincere encouragement from the supervisors and committee members, my intention to yield the position to someone more capable remains unchanged. I sincerely hope that your esteemed associations will understand and forgive me. Your esteemed associations are concerned about the stagnation of chamber affairs, which I also deeply regret. I have already formally submitted a letter to the chamber, fully expressing my thoughts and requesting a re-election. This matter concerns the common interests of all merchants in the city, and I am sure it will be approved. I offer this reply with respect and wish you all good fortune. Xu Jiqing."</p>

<h3 id="e140">Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Encourages Purchase of Indica Rice and Flour <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Another Solution to Relieve the City's Food Shortage</p>
<p>To implement the policy of relieving the city's food shortage, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has recently issued a</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>public notice encouraging citizens to purchase indica rice and flour to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and raising prices. The original text is as follows: "Public Notice: Recently, rice prices have soared, making it difficult for people to obtain food. This bureau has carefully considered the commercial situation and people's livelihood and has set a maximum price for high-quality white japonica rice in the market not exceeding 21 yuan. The price of medium-quality rice should be reduced accordingly, and it is forbidden to sell medium-quality rice at high prices. Furthermore, the price of rice ships arriving in Shanghai will be publicly assessed and distributed to rice shops for sale. This is all to eliminate under-the-table pricing and allow rice shops to sell at correct prices, ensuring that both large and small rice shops have fair access to rice and that citizens can enjoy the benefits of price limits. However, it has recently been reported that some rice shops are still selling white japonica rice at prices as high as 23 or 24 yuan. This bureau has sent personnel to investigate and found that rice shops are generally complying with the price limits. Therefore, the accuracy of the reported news remains to be verified. However, we hope that citizens will follow the bureau's Public Notice No. 154. If any rice shop is found to be charging prices higher than the price limit or selling medium-quality rice at high prices, citizens should immediately submit the receipt or a sample of the rice to the bureau, and strict punishment will be imposed. If citizens do not report such violations and rely solely on the limited number of personnel in this bureau to supervise the thousands of rice shops in the city, it will be impossible to achieve the goal. Therefore, the government's orders can only be implemented with the assistance of the citizens. Citizens, you must know that the rice is currently in the hands of hoarders and large rice merchants. It is not that there is no rice, but that it is not in the hands of farmers. The hoarders believe that the higher the market price, the less willing they will be to sell. They are using the name of the poor autumn harvest last year to fulfill their dreams of getting rich. They do not care about the people's livelihood or consider the people's interests. If you want to buy their rice, they will hoard it and demand high prices. A few rice shops have the same mentality. If we can refrain from buying japonica rice, they will lose the opportunity to hoard. If they cannot sell it in the future, they will be willing to lower the price themselves. Moreover, this bureau has carefully tested various types of white japonica rice and found that the so-called 'special' or 'top-grade' white japonica rice is the least nutritious. You are paying high prices for unhealthy rice, and what you are buying is indica rice. That is the most unprofitable. You did not understand this before, so you bought it. Now that you know, you should realize this and stop buying that expensive and useless top-grade white japonica rice. According to rice merchants, the harvest in various regions this year is expected to be abundant. The abundant harvest of indica rice in Anhui and Jiangxi can be confirmed. The new japonica rice in Kunshan and Zhoupu will be available in half a month at the earliest and in a month at the latest. The peak season will last for little more than a month. There will no longer be the same panic as in the past. When the new rice is available, the hoarders will also release their rice. Furthermore, there are still 800,000 to 900,000 bags of indica rice in the city's warehouses, which is enough to feed the city's population. In the past, people from all over came to Shanghai to buy rice. Now that new wheat is available in the north, the need for rice has decreased. New rice is also available in the Yangtze River region. For example, Zhejiang Province, which has always lacked rice, is now reselling the indica rice it previously bought. Under these circumstances, even if hoarders do not sell a single stone of japonica rice and no rice boats come from the lower reaches of the river, the citizens of Shanghai will not have to worry about not having food. Therefore, this bureau hopes that citizens will not be confused by the atmosphere created by the hoarders and large rice merchants and give them the opportunity to profit. At this time of japonica rice shortage, since there is a large supply of indica rice, we should immediately start eating indica rice or switch to flour. Flour is not lacking in nutrients and is also a domestic product, which is beneficial to people's livelihood and the economy, especially worth buying. This bureau has the responsibility to regulate the food supply and will do its best to do so. Therefore, this public notice is issued to citizens, calling for concerted efforts to switch to indica rice and flour. This is of utmost importance. Special Announcement." (Wuchen News Agency)</p>

<p>▲ Commodity Inspection Bureau Sends Personnel to Towns for Inoculation</p>
<p>Previously, the Livestock and Product Inspection Office of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau had successfully produced bovine plague serum. As a trial, they voluntarily inoculated cattle near Shanghai affected by bovine plague to test the serum and gradually spread it to various regions. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining, due to the outbreak of bovine plague in the Fourth District of Zhenjiang, planned to purchase bovine plague serum from the bureau to prevent its spread and requested that personnel be dispatched to the district to carry out inoculations. The department specially sent Zhang Zhenlin, a member of the Agricultural Extension Committee, to Shanghai to discuss the matter. The department requested that the serum be provided at half price. It is now learned that the bureau has sent technician Shou Biao, accompanied by Committee Member Zhang, carrying a large batch of serum to various rural villages to inoculate draft cattle and strive for relief.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Associations Telegraph Request to Amend Factory Regulations <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Associations telegraphed the National Government, Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday, stating (excerpt): "We have recently received a letter from the Suzhou Iron Silk Weaving Association and others stating that the scale and equipment required by the Factory Law are so vast and detailed that only large factories with huge capital can afford them. Today, Article 1 of the General Provisions (this law applies to those employing 30 or more workers), etc., states that small factories employing 30 or more workers cannot afford such large-scale equipment. Even small factories with hundreds of workers do not have such great financial resources. If this is implemented, not only will there be no effect, but it will inevitably lead to labor unrest and increasingly serious disputes. In recent years, the situation has been turbulent, and labor unrest has occurred frequently. Losses have been frequent, and factories have been struggling. How can they afford the burden of this law? Furthermore, the disputes will become more severe, and there will be more unemployment. Everyone views setting up a factory as a dangerous path, which is not the original intention of the legislation. According to the facts, it is necessary to revise it again. Before the date of implementation is announced and the implementing rules are drafted, we propose that you promptly deliberate and forward this to the relevant authorities for consideration. Accordingly, this matter was specially submitted to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Industry Emergency Conference on June 22nd for public discussion. After deliberation by all representatives, it was unanimously resolved to request the National Government to amend the (30 workers) in Article 1 (this law applies to those employing 30 or more workers) to (3,000 workers) so that commercial sentiment and legal intent can be balanced, and the difficulties of small industrial factories at present can be relieved. Respectfully telegraphing this request in accordance with the decision, earnestly requesting a prompt proposal to the General Assembly for a resolution to amend, announce, and implement."

<h3 id="e146">Silk and Dyeing Industries Telegraph for Relief <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>▲ Telegrams Sent to the Central Government Yesterday</p>
<p>The silk and dyeing industries in this city have been damaged by outsiders, and the soaring prices of raw materials have made business difficult. Representatives from both labor and management in the industry jointly went to Beijing earlier this month to petition the authorities for relief. The labor-management group telegraphed again yesterday, urging prompt relief. To all members of the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, Secretary-General Lu, Chairman Jiang of the National Government, Chief of Civil Affairs Gu, Premier Tan of the Executive Yuan, Director Chen of the Political Affairs Office, Secretary-General Lu, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Director Zhang of the Commercial Affairs Department, Director Yan of the Labor Affairs Department: "Our silk and dyeing industries have been repeatedly damaged by encroachment and destruction by non-industry players. In addition, expensive gold, cheap silver, and soaring raw material prices have made business difficult, endangering both labor and management. Representatives were elected from both sides on the 7th and 8th of this month to jointly go to Beijing to request relief. We were grateful to the committee, the Executive Yuan, and the ministry for their sympathy and willingness to meet us, promising to find a way to provide relief. All of the committee, the Executive Yuan, and the ministry care for industry and commerce and consider the interests of labor and management. The Beijing representatives returned to Shanghai and reported to more than sixty factory owners and three thousand workers, who all praised and prayed, saying that the suffering of our industry would soon be relieved. Our associations, as the groups of the city's silk and dyeing industries, bear a significant mission. In addition to presenting our grievances and requesting relief in the petition, we further telegraph the committee, the Executive Yuan, and the ministry, urging them to implement [relief] promptly and respectfully requesting instructions. The Shanghai Silk and Dyeing Workers' Union, the Shanghai Silk and Dyeing Trade Union, and the Shanghai Silk and Dyeing Industry Association jointly salute."</p>
<h3 id="e147">Ham Industry Opposes Additional Taxes in Zhejiang Province (Continued) <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The ham tax in Zhejiang Province has been consistently nine cents per ham. Starting June 1st this year, the Zhejiang Department of Finance suddenly announced a tax of sixteen cents per ham, causing opposition from ham merchants in various places. The Shanghai Ham Industry Association had previously petitioned the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to forward the matter to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting a cancellation. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has now received a reply from the Zhejiang Provincial Government. It reads as follows: "To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Having received the cablegram from you, we have investigated the matter of additional taxes on ham in this province. Previously, representatives of the ham industry in the five counties of Jinhua, including He Shaohan, as well as the cocoon, Dongyang, and Yiwu county chambers of commerce and ham merchants, repeatedly telegraphed requesting exemption from the additional tax. The provincial government ordered the Department of Finance to review the matter. Subsequently, the department reported that ham is a semi-luxury item. The proposed increase in the tax rate should not exceed 5%, and the burden will still be transferred to the consumers. This should not affect ham merchants or agriculture. The request should not be considered. The department has instructed the county governments to inform them. This case is specially recorded and replied to, hoping to inform the relevant parties." After receiving this reply, the ham industry unanimously believes that the Zhejiang Department of Finance's designation of ham as a semi-luxury item is unfounded. If ham can be called a luxury item, then what about silk and other similar products? The proposed increase in the tax rate should not exceed 5%, which is clearly a result of inaccurate investigation. Various reasons are being prepared to jointly petition the central government with ham industries from various places to achieve the goal of cancellation.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Employees of Two Railways Petition Liu Weichi <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>▲ Liu Expresses Full Acceptance</p>
<p>Employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, due to the Railway Department's newly promulgated salary increase regulations being more restrictive than the old regulations, sent twelve representatives from the five major sections of the railway, including Traffic, Mechanical, Accounting, Engineering, and Electrical, to meet with Director Liu Weichi to petition him on behalf of all employees and to request Minister Sun to withdraw the order. This was reported in the previous issue. It is now learned that the representatives met with Director Liu at 10:00 AM that morning. The representatives first stated the employees' grievances, mainly stating that the salary increase regulations for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways had been set long ago, and the employees had always worked diligently and had never complained. For example, two years ago, the Telegraph and Postal Bureaus requested salary increases due to the difficulty of living, but the employees of our two railways remained the same. The standard of living was lower than it is now, and their income was barely enough to make a living. However, in the past two years, prices have risen, and recently, gold prices have soared, increasing the cost of living by more than two or three times. The Postal and Telegraph Bureaus have devised proper measures to compensate their employees for their livelihood, allowing them to work with peace of mind. However, not only have the employees of our two railways not received any compensation, but new regulations have been promulgated that reduce the annual salary increase from six yuan to five yuan, and the salary of one hundred yuan, which could be obtained in nine years, is delayed to thirteen years. Given that the original salary was already insufficient, the implementation of the new regulations would be tantamount to rowing against the current, and the livelihood prospects of the employees of the two railways would be bleak. What our employees are asking for now is simply to cancel the new regulations and maintain the original regulations. This is also reasonable and does not have any blackmailing intent. Since Director Liu has taken office, he has been committed to creating benefits for the employees and promoting the development of the two railways. He should adopt our proposal. Director Liu then spoke, stating that he fully accepted what the representatives said and would forward it to Minister Sun, and would do his best to petition on behalf of the employees of the two railways. For those with salaries below one hundred yuan, measures should be taken to provide compensation first.</p>

<h3 id="e153">City Health Bureau's Progress in Epidemic Prevention Inoculations - Recent News <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Since the City Health Bureau expanded epidemic prevention inoculations on May 1st, over 230,000 citizens have benefited from free vaccinations. To further facilitate free vaccinations for citizens, the bureau continues to send medical personnel to factories, organizations, and densely populated slum areas for free inoculations. Recently, two mobile vaccination vehicles have been deployed, one in Zhabei and one in Nanshi,巡迴交通衝繁路口及各菜塲 [They] tour busy intersections and various vegetable markets daily to provide vaccinations for citizens. Each vehicle vaccinates approximately 1,000 people per day on average. Additionally, personnel are stationed on the first and second ferries of the Public Works Bureau, providing free vaccinations. Each ferry vaccinates approximately 100 people per day on average. According to bureau personnel, citizens have been enthusiastically seeking vaccinations this year. The current number of medical personnel is still insufficient due to two factors: Firstly, the Health Bureau's epidemic prevention efforts have been ongoing for two years, resulting in considerable public trust. Secondly, this year, funding has been provided by the National Government, allowing for greater development in personnel and publicity, making vaccinations more accessible to citizens. If sufficient funds were available to establish four or five free clinics, it would greatly benefit citizens in terms of epidemic prevention and medical treatment, it is said.</p>

<p>▲Implemented Starting September 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association issued a notice yesterday to all members, stating: "Respectfully, upon receiving Order No. 4279 from the Jiangsu High Court, regarding the correction of the new lawyer uniform regulations by July 1st of this year, the attached drawings were found to be inconsistent with the drawings published in the January 12, 18th year of the Republic of China Judicial Gazette. It is deeply feared that members will purchase different styles separately, leading to further discrepancies. Therefore, the Association designated a clothing store to produce sample uniforms and made corrections back and forth until completion. It is extremely difficult to complete the production within the deadline. Furthermore, inquiries with the presidents of the Second Branch of the High Court and the Special District Local Court revealed that neither court has received orders to correct the uniforms within a specific timeframe. The court inspectors and clerks of both courts have no plans to correct the new uniforms by a specific date. This raises the question of whether members of this Association should continue to wear the old uniforms in the various courts in the concessions after July 1st. For these two reasons, a request for a two-month extension was telegraphed on June 22nd. Subsequently, Order No. 3691 from the Jiangsu High Court was received, stating that the Association's request for an extension until September 1st for implementing the correction of lawyer uniforms was difficult to approve, and that the style of the hat should be in accordance with the style published in the Judicial Gazette. At the same time, a letter was received from Chief Prosecutor Wang of the same court, stating that the Association's difficulties and reasons for being unable to complete the production in time had been discussed with Court President Lin of the High Court, who agreed that all lawyers could continue to wear their existing uniforms in court until August 31st of this year, but that the order must be complied with on September 1st. Upon receiving this, in addition to submitting it to the Jiangsu High Court and the Shanghai Local Court for filing, a corresponding letter is hereby sent to your members, stating that the old uniforms may still be worn in court until August 31st of this year, but that the new lawyer uniforms must be corrected and implemented on September 1st. Please take note and act accordingly."</p>

<p>▲Taxpayers Association Forwards Reply to City Health Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association previously received a letter from the Shanghai City Health Bureau requesting notification to the concession authorities to inspect prostitutes. Yesterday, a reply from the Public Works Bureau regarding this matter was received. The Association immediately forwarded a letter to the City Health Bureau, stating: "Respectfully, regarding the matter of inspecting prostitutes, a reply from the Public Works Bureau has been received, stating in a letter dated July 6th: 'Regarding the request to implement the inspection of prostitutes, the prostitute issue was carefully considered by a special committee in 1919. As a result, all licensed brothels were officially closed by this Bureau. As for the inspection, it effectively entails two methods: registration and examination. Implementing it would be tantamount to the official recognition of brothel operations. Furthermore, registration has little obvious effect on suppressing prostitution and preventing venereal diseases. As for medical examinations, countries that have implemented similar methods have all failed, as examinations must be conducted daily, which is practically impossible to achieve. To make it truly effective, it must be accompanied by isolation and treatment measures. Based on the above two reasons, countries generally do not implement any other suppression measures for prostitution other than providing adequate medical facilities, such as venereal disease hospitals. Such medical facilities are already readily available in Shanghai. A corresponding reply is hereby sent for your information. We hope you will take note and act accordingly.'"</p>

<h3 id="e161">Over 500,000 Gold Bars Seized on Canadian Empress <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Three boxes containing over 300 gold bars</p>
<p>Wrapped in thick paper and tightly bound with cloth</p>
<p>Authorities are strictly investigating the smuggling merchants</p>
<p>Since the soaring gold prices and plummeting silver prices, China, as a silver standard country, has been greatly affected both domestically and internationally. Prices have risen, the people's livelihood has declined, and the national economy is in danger of fundamental bankruptcy. The government authorities have carefully planned relief measures. It is generally agreed that it is difficult to immediately switch to the gold standard in practice due to various difficulties. In order to alleviate the immediate crisis, in addition to ordering all customs offices to uniformly use gold units to collect taxes on import and export goods, an order has recently been issued to strictly prohibit the export of gold and the import of raw silver, in order to remedy the situation to the greatest extent possible. After the prohibition order was issued, the effect has not yet been seen, but it is known that some evil merchants have disregarded the survival of the country and secretly exported gold for profit. According to a report from the 報載 [newspaper] yesterday, in the past month, the amount of yellow goods shipped from China to Japan has reached a staggering 4 million yuan. The source is said to be that some Chinese people in Shanghai bought and transported it to Japan via Manchuria. It can be seen that the various transportation methods of these people cannot be known by outsiders. However, this is only the number from Japan alone, and the amount transported to other countries is not included. Moreover, Shanghai is the main port for export, so the Jianghai Customs authorities are inspecting foreign ships more strictly than before when they leave the port. The Canadian Empress, a large ship of the Changxing Company's World Class, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 12th and left for Hong Kong the day before yesterday (the 13th). When the ship was about to leave the dock at the China Merchants North Wharf, the customs authorities had received a tip-off in advance that a large amount of gold bars was secretly being exported on the ship, so they specially dispatched a number of Chinese and foreign customs officers to board the ship and search it. On the spot, they found three boxes in the cabin full of yellow goods, totaling more than 300 gold bars of various sizes. The large ones weighed about 20 taels of gold, and the small ones weighed five, six, or ten taels, with a total value of more than 500,000 yuan. Each gold bar was wrapped in thick paper and then tightly bound with cloth. The way they transported the gold onto the ship was very ingenious. They wore a canvas vest with a number of pockets sewn on it, and hid the gold bars in the pockets. Each person could hide more than 20 catties of gold each time, which is about 30,000 yuan. Then, they boarded the ship and secretly hid the vest with gold in the box. Their actions were secretive and difficult for outsiders to detect. After the huge amount of gold was discovered, it was transferred to a small boat by customs officers and transported to the customs warehouse for temporary storage. The customs authorities considered this the first major case of smuggling a huge amount of gold for export and attached great importance to it. At the same time, government officials also sent people to the customs to inspect and study the method of smuggling. It is reported that the authorities are now strictly investigating the smuggling merchants who secretly transported the huge amount of gold for export in order to investigate and handle the matter thoroughly. On the one hand, the seized gold will be temporarily kept in the warehouse, and the head of the 水巡捕房 [water police station] will be ordered to supervise the detectives to guard it.</p>

<p>▲First Taking Sleeping Pills</p>
<p>▲Then Jumping into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>▲Rescued Both Times</p>
<p>▲Youth Should Strive</p>
<p>Xu Xuqin from Shangyu is 19 years old. His father, Xu Hongzhou, is currently working as an engineer on the railway in Zhangjiakou, Hebei. When Xu was 13 years old, he studied at a middle school in Beiping with his father for more than two years, but then abandoned his studies and loafed around until now. However, his desire to study has never been abandoned. In March of this year, his father ordered him to return to his hometown, and then sent letters repeatedly urging Xuqin to return north. However, Xu, eager to study, never expressed his consent. Recently, after repeated urging from his uncle, he took 40 yuan of travel expenses and came to Shanghai by train in order to take a boat back north. Unexpectedly, 20 yuan was stolen from him on the train. He arrived in Shanghai on the 4th of this month and first stayed at the Qichang Hotel on Simalu [4th Avenue] for eight days, and then changed to the Shanghai New Hotel at Daxin Street. Unexpectedly, Xu, feeling sad about his fate, suddenly had the thought of厌世 [being tired of the world]. That evening, the waiter of the hotel saw him writing letters several times, but they were all torn up. The waiter was very suspicious. The next morning, when the sun was high, Xu had not yet gotten up. The waiter called him from outside, but there was no response, so he tried to move the door panel and enter. He saw Xu lying on the bed, barely breathing. He saw two bottles of sleeping pills on the table, knowing that he had taken medicine to commit suicide. He immediately tried various methods and splashed cold water on his face to wake him up. Later, it was learned that Xu bought the two bottles of sleeping pills for one yuan. However, the medicine was not very potent and his life was saved. Unexpectedly, Xu's desire to commit suicide did not diminish at all. The night before, he wrote a farewell letter to his father at the hotel and put it on the table. Yesterday morning, he took a ferry to Pudong. At 9:00 a.m., he took a Taikoo Company快大 [fast big]輪船 [steamship] from the Huatong Pier in Pudong and sailed to the center of the river. Xu immediately jumped into the river in an attempt to end his life. Fortunately, he was rescued by a sailor on the ship and handed over to Chinese Constable No. 44 of the 水巡捕房 [water police station], who took him to the police station. Xu's mind was still not very clear and he still looked tired, probably due to the sleeping pills. The police chief interrogated him and learned the whole story, and took his suicide note from the hotel. He then sent Chinese Detective No. 3 Cheng Yongnian to send Xu to the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association on Qipu Road to be taken in, and sent him to the hospital for treatment. After his spirit returned to its original state, he was sent back to his home. Here is a copy of his farewell letter to his father:</p>
<p>Beloved father, since I sent you two letters on the seventh and eighth of last month, more than a month has passed and I have not received a reply. My heart is extremely anxious. I wonder if you, sir, are angry that I have not gone north and will not answer. The reason why I hesitated to come north at that time was because I secretly wanted to apply to the Labor University in the south, which is why I delayed. My humble intention is nothing more than to seek study and employment. My uncle had already agreed to let me enter the school to study after the summer vacation, but since you, sir, previously wrote in your letter that you wanted me to return, your intentions were so earnest that I did not dare to mention staying to him until now. Waiting for your letter to arrive, I was afraid that you, sir, had already lost heart, and because the weather will gradually become hot in the future, the journey will be inconvenient, so he arranged travel expenses for me and urged me to go north as soon as possible in order to fulfill my filial piety. When I came, he told me that if I entered the school to study after coming north, he could send me tuition fees. His intentions were so generous that I could not refuse any longer, so I set off from home a few days ago. It has been several days since I came to Shanghai. Staying in the hotel, I think about my decision every day. For the past few days, my mind has been confused and my heart is very painful. Looking forward to the future, I hesitate to move forward. Thinking that my studies have been delayed for several months since I came south, what face do I have to see my father in the north? Alas, if fate is like this, what joy is there in life? After thinking for several nights, I feel that in order to relieve the pain of my body and mind, there is no better way than to destroy this body. Now I have decided to do this. I think that I am inherently stupid and did not work hard in the past. Now that I am older, I have not achieved anything in terms of knowledge. I only have regrets. Even if I steal my life in the world, I will only be mediocre and unable to glorify my family, nor can I continue your ambitions. It is better to die. If I have consciousness after death, I can see my ancestors and mothers in the underground, is it not more joyful than苟生 [living aimlessly]? Only thinking about relying on you, sir, for half my life, now that I am dying once and for all, receiving the kindness of raising me for nineteen years, then my crime of being unfilial is truly as deep as heaven and earth, and I cannot excuse myself. When writing this letter, how can I not be heartbroken and tears fall like rain? You, sir, are in your prime and do not have to worry about having no son. You also have a strong faith in religion and can understand this matter. I hope that you, sir, will not bear grudges and think about me, so that the soul in the springs will increase its sins and uneasiness. I am grieving while writing this letter and do not want to write more, lest it increase your pain. I write this with tears and sincerely wish you, sir, progress in your morality and cherish your future. Unfilial son Xuqin's last words, July 12.</p>

<p>▲Allegations by the Russian Detective</p>
<p>▲Cannot Be Proven</p>
<p>Qulun, a Russian detective from the General Patrol Room No. 220, was bathing at the Jiangwan Road Public Swimming Pool on the afternoon of the 6th of this month. Wang Caiqi, a Pudong native bathing with him, mistakenly took his towel. Qulun accused Wang of theft and wanted to take him to the police station. Guan Bomian, a native of Anhui who was also bathing, came forward to mediate and was also implicated. The next day, they were escorted to the Special District Local Court. It was ordered that Guan be released on bail and Wang be detained for questioning. It has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng continued the hearing. The Chinese and foreign witnesses who appeared in court included Yang Jinpeng, the inspector of the swimming pool, Kana, a westerner and inspector of the Public Works Bureau's health department, and the Russian You Yunke Limali. The court repeatedly questioned both sides for a long time. Finally, Prosecutor Guo expressed his opinion that, based on the statements of the witnesses, it was impossible to prove the allegations made by the plaintiff. It was difficult to establish the case. Judge Feng then pronounced that Wang and Guan were both not guilty. The lawyer from the Patrol Room heard the verdict and requested that Guan Bomian's 500 yuan bail be temporarily retained during the appeal period. The judge approved it.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Zhou Abing Recounts His Kidnapping Experience <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>▲Kidnappers Torture Hostage</p>
<p>▲Gunshots Ring Out, Kidnappers Flee</p>
<p>▲Entire Village Suspected of Being Accomplices</p>
<p>▲Old Woman Lends Key for Release</p>
<p>Zhou Rentang's son, Zhou Abing, a resident of Zhoujiazhai Township in 北蔡東首 [North Cai East First] in Pudong, is engaged in the business of driving barges. He owns several barges that are used by the Modern Cleaning Bureau to transport manure. A few days ago, Abing led two crew members in a barge loaded with 16 tons of manure to the Liantang area near Songjiang to unload it. When the empty boat was returning and passing through the 馬瀝港浦面 [Mali Port Surface] at the junction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it was suddenly encountered by a pirate ship, and several pirates jumped on board and looted it. In addition to taking all the more than 40 yuan in silver hidden under the stove, Abing was kidnapped. It is now known that Abing was in the bandit's den for five or six days, and he escaped the night before last. He has now arrived in Shanghai and recounted in detail his experience in the bandit's den. According to him, (the following is Abing's account): On that day, he was escorted by the bandits to the small town of Shihutang, and then to an empty house in Zhaojiabang (i.e., Zhaojia Hall) and locked up. The place was a village with dozens of households. There was only a wooden bed in the empty house. In the evening, a small, stout man resembling the bandit leader (about thirty years old, wearing glasses on his nose) came to interrogate me. The bandit asked if the manure boat was self-owned. I said it was the Cleaning Bureau's boat, and I was only transporting manure on behalf of the bureau. The bandit asked how much property my family had. I said my family was very poor. The bandit said he didn't believe me, that I was very cunning. Since I had more than 40 yuan in silver hidden under the stove, and I only said I had 3 yuan, it was really hateful. Since I was here, I needed 5,000 yuan to be redeemed. How much could I pay? I said I really had no money. The bandit said if I had no money, I would be tortured. So, the bandits stripped off my 香雲紗 [fragrant cloud gauze] pants, tied my hands and feet with ropes in the opposite direction, and hung me up in the air to torture me. Then, one bandit stood on my back and squatted down several times. After a while, they put me down, locked my neck with a huge iron chain, and locked one end on the bed leg, and sent two bandits to guard me. The next day, they came to torture me again. Because I could not bear the pain, I agreed to pay 1,000 yuan. The bandits did not agree and added another 400 yuan. The bandits still did not agree. I was locked up for five days and nights. The afternoon before last, I suddenly heard two gunshots outside, and it was rumored that the police were coming to search for the kidnappers. At this point, the two bandits guarding me told me that I was not allowed to make a sound or escape. After saying that, they left. But I was still locked up. I thought there was no way to unlock the lock, and there was nothing to break the iron chain. I had no way, so I lit the mosquito net with a candle, intending to set fire to it. Unexpectedly, the house was empty and only the mosquito net was burned, but the house was not set on fire. Neighbors saw the smoke billowing in the house and came in to investigate. I begged them to release me, but they ignored me. At this point, I thought that there was no way to survive, so I might as well take my own life to end my life. So, I slammed my head against the huge stone in front of the bed. Fortunately, an old woman came forward to stop me and said that she was going to do good deeds and release me. So, she got the key from another place and unlocked the lock. I thanked the old woman and escaped from the bandit's den at night. I ran all night and swam across three rivers and canals, including the 馬瀝港 [Mali Port]. Fortunately, I was not drowned. The next morning, I thought to myself that I had no money, and the 香雲紗 [fragrant cloud gauze] shirt and pants I was wearing had been stripped off by the bandits and replaced with tattered cloth pants. Barefoot, I was lucky enough to meet a manure boat that I knew, and I borrowed one yuan. I went to Shihutang Station and took a train to Shanghai. All the villagers in the bandit's den seemed to be accomplices. Every afternoon, seven or eight people wearing the 保衛團 [security corps] uniform came to the village with the villagers to commit crimes. The stolen money and silver were divided equally. The bandits all carried box cannons, pistols, short guns,刺刀 [bayonets] and other weapons. The Zhaojia Hall area was a well-known bandit's den. That day, I don't know where the two gunshots came from, causing the two thieves who were guarding me to flee, so I was able to escape in the meantime, which was also a stroke of bad luck. I recall being tortured by the bandits twice in the bandit's den, and I still feel the pain.</p>

The police chief comforted her a few words and sent a detective to send her home.</p>

<p>▲Lou Jinhua Laoqi Dies</p>
<p>On the night of the 9th, a tragic car ride accident occurred in 北新涇 [North Xinjing], and the report has been published three times in this newspaper. In addition to Xiaomeimei [Little Sister] in the car, who died on the spot, there were two other prostitutes. The older one, named Lou Jinhua Laoqi, had her abdomen crushed and her intestines flowing out. Therefore, her injuries were more serious than those of Zui Xiangge Laosi [Drunk Fragrance Pavilion Fourth], who was discharged from the hospital earlier. Laoqi died the day before yesterday after Xiaomeimei [Little Sister]. Laoqi was from Jiangsu and was 20 years old. Her surname was Li. Yesterday, the patrol room transferred the body to the 斐倫路 [Feilun Road] autopsy institute. In the morning, the Special District Local Court commissioned Prosecutor Xu to come to the institute to investigate. He ordered Li Zhu, who was in the same hospital as the deceased, to sign a statement to collect the body and coffin.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Yesterday's Final Arguments in the Fang Estate Dispute Case <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>▲ Verdict to be announced on the 21st of this month</p>
<p>The late Fang Danchi, originally from Hubei and formerly an official in Jiangxi Province, left behind an estate. His son, Fang Dacan, alleged that his father's third concubine, Deng, and her father, Deng Guannan, conspired with Wang Shutang to steal the estate. The former Provisional Court ruled against the plaintiff, Fang Dacan, who appealed, engaging lawyer Zhan Jifeng. Yesterday morning, Chief Judge Du of the Jiangsu Higher Court's branch court, along with Judges Gao and Ye, held a hearing, questioning each party in detail. Fang Dacan testified that the family estate was managed by his father and had not been divided among his uncles. Deng, his third stepmother, took advantage of his father's illness to steal 美豐, 中南, 四明, and 明華 bank passbooks and 120 gold pounds and seventeen taels and five mace of gold leaf from an iron box. Because the account books were stolen at the same time, the exact amount of the deposits could not be determined, but it was estimated to be between 160,000 and 200,000. This was discovered on the fifth day after his father's death on the fourth day of the eighth month of last year. Only Deng was present in his father's sickroom, serving him medicine. She has now admitted to stealing the gold pounds and gold leaf and handing them over to her father, who then passed them on to Wang Shutang for safekeeping. Therefore, the bank passbooks must also have been stolen in collusion. Wang was a close friend of his father and often came to their house, etc. Deng Guannan testified that he came to Shanghai last April to stay with his son-in-law, Fang Danchi. After Danchi's death, Dacan wanted to search his daughter's room, so his daughter handed over eighty gold pounds and more than ten taels of gold leaf to him, asking him to entrust them to Wang Shutang for safekeeping. At the end of August, the deceased's brother, Fengchi, asked Wang for the gold pounds, etc. Wang then returned the items to his daughter. He knew nothing about the passbooks. Deng also testified that her family's property was managed by her husband and his brother, Hechi, and she did not know the exact amount. The eighty gold pounds and more than ten taels of gold leaf were given to her by her husband as compensation for her jewelry, as she had gold jewelry that she could not wear during her father-in-law's funeral. Her husband sold the jewelry, and last summer, he gave her the gold pounds and gold leaf. After her husband's death, his brother, Fengchi, and Dacan, both forced her to hand over the gold items. Because she already owned them, she ordered her father to take them to Wang Shutang's house and entrust them to Wang for safekeeping. Later, Wang was asked for them by Fengchi, so he returned them to her. However, she was eventually forced to hand over forty-four gold pounds and the remaining gold leaf, which she had already sold and spent. She also denied knowing anything about the passbooks. Wang Shutang also admitted to holding the gold items for Deng and said that after Danchi's death, he had, at the request of his family, mortgaged tobacco and purchased a coffin on their behalf. Because the family had no funds, he temporarily mortgaged the gold pounds to a coffin shop (Jufeng Timber Company). When the tobacco mortgage was completed, he redeemed the gold pounds with the money and returned them to Deng, etc. Then, the arguments began. Lawyer Zhan first stated that Deng was Danchi's favorite concubine and often opened the iron box and withdrew money on his behalf when he was ill, or signed checks on his behalf. How could she not know the amount of property? In short, the account books of Jufeng Timber Company and Wang Shutang's bills could not be trusted. Finally, he pointed out that Deng came to Shanghai last December and did not stay at her uncle's house but stayed at Wang Shutang's place. Later, she and Wang were apprehended together at the North Station Inn. Deng Guannan's coming to Shanghai was even more suspicious. When he left Hubei, he said he was going upstream, but then he suddenly came to Shanghai, which was even more suspicious. Because of all these things, the plaintiff believed that there was a conspiracy to steal, so he appealed, requesting punishment and the return of all the property. Next, the lawyers for Deng and her father replied, stating that the plaintiff's allegations were unfounded. If Fang Danchi really had hundreds of thousands of property, why didn't he say a word to his son before his death? If Deng had really committed theft, she would have fled and been afraid to be found, how could she have escorted the coffin back to her hometown and observed mourning? Finally, lawyer Jiang Yiping defended Wang Shutang. The court ordered that the verdict be announced on the morning of July 21.</p>

<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Bao Jusheng, a silk merchant from Huzhou, lived at Hengmao Silk Shop in Dean Lane, North Suzhou Road. At 9:50 pm on the 6th of this month, he finished bathing at Tianfa Pool on Nanjing Road and was returning home. As he exited Tianfa Pool, crossed Nanjing Road, and walked along the sidewalk near the intersection of Lao Jiuzhang and Shixinchang, a car driven by an American reporter for the Times, Chinnar, came from east to west and knocked Bao Jusheng down on the sidewalk in front of Shixinchang. The reporter immediately took Bao to Renji Hospital in his own car. Due to severe head injuries, Bao died at the hospital at about 6 pm on the 9th after medical treatment failed. The police immediately notified the reporter by phone to come to the scene. However, the reporter ignored the summons several times. It is said that the judge fined the reporter 500 yuan for compensation, but the reporter was only willing to pay 150 yuan. It is now heard that the deceased's younger brother, Bao Yousheng, believes that the reporter's illegal driving caused the accident and that if the matter is resolved so casually, foreigners will not value the lives of Chinese people in the future. Therefore, he has decided to prepare all the evidence and formally negotiate with the reporter.</p>

<p>Gao Deli Lane on Zhiyuan Road, Zhabei, has an artesian well for supplying drinking water to tenants. However, the well is too shallow, and the water quality is turbid. The tenants in the lane have asked the landlord to connect to tap water but have been refused. They reported this to the Municipal Public Works Bureau, which sent personnel to investigate and found that the well was equipped with two hand-operated pumps that were operated manually. Recently, due to the low water level, the pumps have failed, resulting in frequent water outages. The tenants have requested to connect to tap water, but the rental office is still hesitant because the well has been repaired several times and has cost a lot of money. After the Municipal Public Works Bureau sent personnel to earnestly persuade them, they entrusted the Tongli Water and Electricity Company to connect the water pipes. Now, they have formally reported to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to connect the water.</p>

<p>At about 10 am on the 12th of this month, Shen Xiaoyang, a foreman at the Jianghaiguan Wharf in Yangshupu, saw the body of a child with a severed head in a wasteland on Lan Road. The child was about seven or eight years old, wearing a white and blue-trimmed children's Western-style suit and old yellow leather shoes. The child was bald and appeared to have been murdered. He reported this to the Yangshupu Police Station, which immediately ordered Chinese detective Zhang Jiaxuan to investigate. The body was taken to the forensic examination office on Ferron Road. Yesterday morning, Xu Mei, a prosecutor from the Special District Court, arrived at the office and confirmed that the body had indeed been murdered. Since no relatives of the deceased could be found, the body was sent to the Pushan Cemetery.</p>

<p>Cases of river steamers smuggling opium into the port are often discovered. At about 7 pm the night before last (the 13th), someone on a certain foreign steamer from the Yangtze River smuggled a large amount of opium. Because the ship docked in Pudong, the smuggled opium was secretly loaded onto a small sampan while no one was paying attention and secretly unloaded from the ship. A certain person engaged in smuggling accompanied the opium across the river, intending to land at the Taikoo Company Wharf in the French Concession. At that time, the French Concession was holding a Democratic Republic Anniversary celebration, and the foreign firms along the Bund were decorated with electric lights, and French officials and gentry were holding lantern parades to celebrate. Spectators gathered, and the smugglers were trying to take advantage of the crowds to blend in. Unexpectedly, the police authorities had received a report early on and dispatched detectives and prepared a car to wait in front of the Taikoo Wharf. When the sampan arrived at the port, the detectives boarded the boat and searched it, seizing two large sacks and one large bag of smuggled opium on the spot, the quantity was very large. The person escorting the opium saw that the smuggled opium had been seized and jumped into the Huangpu River in an attempt to commit suicide, but he was pulled up by the detectives, he was half submerged. The smuggled opium was immediately loaded into a car and taken away. The escorting criminal was taken by small steamer to the east of the Qing Concession.</p>

<p>At the South Railway Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway yesterday morning at about 8:00 am, the fourth express train to Hangzhou was about to depart. An old woman, about sixty years old, came to the station to buy a ticket to Chang'an.

It is reported that the old woman's name is Jia Ding, sixty years old. The opium was entrusted to her by someone else, who paid her four yuan as a reward to transport it to Chang'an Station, where someone would receive it.</p>

<p>Wang Lanyu, a Huizhou native who runs an ink-making shop in Chaguan Lane, Nancang Street, outside Xiaonanmen, has a daughter, Wang Lianshi, who is nineteen years old this year. She is petite, exquisite, and beautiful, and rarely leaves the house. However, Cao Liyi, a frivolous loafer employed by Wang, often seduced Lianshi, flattering her in every way. There was no good outcome for the single man and resentful woman. Until yesterday, Cao actually tricked Lianshi into going out. When they arrived at Xiaodongmenkou, Wang asked Lianshi to spend the rest of her life with him and go to Nanjing with him. However, Lianshi was thinking of her parents and could not bear to be separated, so she was unwilling to go with him. Cao then devised a plan to take her to the Bund Wharf, intending to trick her onto a ship and achieve his abduction. However, Wang, having learned that his daughter had gone out and also seeing that Cao was not there, knew that there must be something wrong, so he ordered his eldest son, Wang Zida, to go out and search for her. Therefore, Cao and the others were seen by Wang Zida while they were wandering around the wharf, and he twisted them up and dragged them home. Lianshi told her father about what had happened. Wang Lanyu immediately twisted up Cao and took him to the First District First Precinct, requesting an investigation. After questioning, Wang Lianshi confessed, "Cao Liyi did abduct me. I was unwilling." Cao Liyi confessed, "Lianshi and I loved each other and could not bear to be separated. She voluntarily went out with me in order to facilitate the freedom of marriage." The chief of the precinct, having heard the confessions, determined that the case involved the abduction of a girl under the age of twenty. Therefore, he transferred the case to the District Court for trial yesterday.</p>

<p>▲ In-laws thought she was suffering from heatstroke</p>
<p>▲ Sent to the hospital for treatment but could not be saved</p>
<p>Li Zhou, a female switchboard operator at the China Foreign Telephone Company, was a Cantonese woman aged twenty-five. At 7:30 am the day before yesterday, she went from her residence in the French Concession to visit her in-laws, Li Shuncai and Li Bai, at 513 Sandu Lane (Chinese Concession) on Jiaozhou Road, West Shanghai. After talking about family affairs for a short while, Li Zhou suddenly suffered from 河鱼之疾 (sudden severe pain), her abdomen ached severely, and her face turned pale. Her mother-in-law, Li Bai, thought it was heatstroke because it was the height of summer, so she urgently hired a car to take her to the Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road for treatment. However, the illness was severe, and she died in the hospital at about 9 am. The hospital then reported to the Putuo Road Police Station, which sent detective Zhao Fuhai to investigate. According to the neighbors, Li Zhou's death was not from a disease, but from consuming opium. They took the body to the Ferron Road Forensic Examination Office. Yesterday morning, Xu, a prosecutor from the Special District Court, arrived at the office and confirmed that the deceased had indeed died from consuming opium. The court summoned Li Shuncai and his wife to give testimony. They testified, "When our daughter-in-law came, she showed no signs of anything unusual. Later, she complained of abdominal pain, and we suspected it was heatstroke, so we sent her to the hospital. We really don't know if she consumed opium." After the examination, Prosecutor Xu ordered Li Shuncai to sign a statement and claim the body for burial.</p>

<p>Xu Yuhe, a salt merchant from Yancheng who is a road construction worker, lives in a bungalow behind the Xiangyan Bridge Fenshui Temple in Hujia Bridge. He had a friend named Kong Qingyu, who is fifty-nine years old this year and has no family. Xu took him in because he thought he had no one to take care of him. Unexpectedly, Kong was ungrateful. Recently, the weather has been hot, and Xu has an eighteen-year-old daughter, Xu Da'e. Da'e was taking a bath in the room. Kong, who was bored, wandered around and heard the sound of water in the room. He peeked through the crack in the door and saw Da'e bathing naked. Kong could not restrain himself and pushed the door open and grabbed her to rape her. Da'e screamed for help, and her grandmother, Gan Zhu, heard it. She stepped forward to pull Kong away and scolded him for being an animal. Kong was enraged and chopped Gan Zhu's head with a knife. Fortunately, the neighbors arrived and restrained Kong and called the police at the Fifth District Third Precinct.

<p>Chen Aizhu, the adopted daughter of Chen Zhangsheng, is twenty-nine years old. Chen has no children, so he cherishes Aizhu. The marriage contract between Chen Aizhu and Chen Azhu was made in the 17th year of the Republic (1928) and wedding was planned for the autumn this year. Unexpectedly, Aizhu has recently changed her behavior, even leaving the family and staying outside. She has asked someone to write a petition to the District Court demanding marital autonomy and the cancellation of her marriage contract with Chen Azhu. The case has been heard but not concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Tong Shenglv continued the hearing. The plaintiff, Chen Aizhu, was absent. The defendant, Chen Azhu, testified that he made a marriage agreement with Aizhu on March 26 of the previous year and sent her forty yuan in gifts and four pieces of gold jewelry on that day. In September of last year, he sent another two hundred and eighty yuan as a wedding gift. They originally intended to marry in August of this year, and he requested that the marriage contract remain valid. Chen Zhangsheng testified that his adopted daughter, Aizhu, has been working as a seamstress. He now knows that his daughter has been hidden by Zhao Maotou, a worker at the Riyue Port Paper Mill. Chen Hu (Chen Zhangsheng's wife) testified that she had obtained Aizhu's consent when they made the marriage contract in the past. Unexpectedly, Aizhu was seduced by someone and fled outside on the third day of November of last year, leading to litigation. She requested that the court fulfill the marriage. Defendant's lawyer Liu Xiangqi also made a statement. The judge said that the plaintiff was not present today, but the plaintiff was not old enough, and she must have a guardian in order to be legal. He would send another summons, and if she was not present next time, the court would make a judgment.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Jin Dekang Files for Cohabitation <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>▲ His wife has run away without a trace</p>
<p>Jin Dekang, a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, married Wang Guizhen (i.e., Jin Wang), a woman from the Liuyang Orphanage in the Xujiahui Catholic Church, in October 1928 because he lacked a housekeeper. The relationship between the couple was not bad. However, she was naturally romantic and often ran away. Jin repeatedly persuaded her to no avail, so he sent her back to the orphanage, ordering her to reform. Soon, she wrote a letter to her husband, stating that she had repented and asking to be taken out. So Jin went to the orphanage and took her back. He deposited money in the HSBC Bank, allowing her to withdraw interest of twenty yuan per month as pocket money. Jin Dekang can be said to have been benevolent and righteous to her. Last winter, she ran away without her husband's knowledge. Jin Dekang filed a lawsuit in the District Court requesting cohabitation. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Qufei held a hearing. The defendant, Jin Wang, was not present because her address was unknown and could not be served. A special agent, lawyer Zhou Yu, appeared in court to make a statement on her behalf. Jin Dekang, 54 years old, from Zhongshan, testified that he lived at number 18-19, Songbai Lane, Wusong Road, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, and was currently a businessman in a foreign firm. He also testified that the relationship between his wife and him was good. In the summer of last year, she was young (Jin Wang was 22 years old and from Suzhou) and was tricked by someone and committed adultery with him. He repeatedly enlightened and persuaded her, but unexpectedly, in December, she relapsed and became acquainted with Feng Muqing and lived in hiding in Taiyuan Lane on Zilaishui Street, French Concession. The official asked why he did not report it, and Jin replied that he was sorry he had no evidence. He was asked how much salary he earned each month, and he replied about one hundred yuan. The judge then asked Prosecutor Xu to come to the court to give his opinion and announced the end of the debate, which was scheduled for the 16th.</p>

<p>Lin Ni, a woman living in Baoyu Lane, French Concession, lost her son, Lin Desheng, last year. It has now been discovered that he was abducted by Chai Benrong, a waiter at an inn opened by Chen Wenrong. She immediately reported this to the police, who arrested Chai and the innkeeper. The plaintiff presented the previous situation and the police chief reported that Chai was a habitual offender and asked for a heavy sentence. The boy Lin Desheng testified that it was true that he ran away because he was abused by Lin Ni. Chai Benrong testified that Lin Desheng was a stray and was being cared for at home and that he did not dare to abduct him. Innkeeper Chen Wenrong testified that Chai Benrong was a waiter who was unaware of the child abduction. The Chinese and Western officials sentenced Chai to one month in the Western jail, and after the term was up, he would be permanently expelled from the Concession. Chen Wenrong was fined fifteen yuan, which was confiscated. Lin Desheng was sent to the court for care.</p>

<p>▲ The evil deeds of matchmakers</p>
<p>Jin Yukang, a thirty-nine-year-old man from Shaoxing, lives at number 120 in a lane on Haichao Temple Street outside Xiaonanmen. He is employed in a foreign goods store in Annam, so he is often away from home and rarely returns. His wife, Xiao, is thirty-four years old. Although they have been married for many years, they have no children, so they bought a girl named A Lin as an adopted daughter. A Lin is seventeen years old this year and is quite beautiful, but she is temperamental. Last month, Xiao suddenly gave birth to a son and was overjoyed. She hired a Songjiang woman, Yu Shen, as a wet nurse. More than a month later, Chen He, a woman from the same hometown as Shen, often came to chat. After seeing A Lin, she suddenly became tempted to abduct her. So she used her skills to seduce A Lin, who fell into her trap. At about 11 am yesterday, Xiao was about to cook lunch and ordered her daughter to take a pot to fetch water. After leaving, she met He and was invited into a small lane to talk. Chen He said, "You are suffering here. Why don't you go back to Songjiang with me? Then you won't have to worry about clothing and food. If you are willing, I will wait at the Guanqiao Wharf now, and you can come quickly. Then we can go together. I have all the money, so don't worry." A Lin was moved by vanity and agreed. Xiao was at home, waiting for a long time and did not see A Lin return. Anxiously, she went out to look for her and happened to see A Lin talking quietly with He in a small lane. Suspicious, she stepped forward and questioned them. He saw that she had been exposed and fled. Xiao scolded A Lin and ordered her to fetch water. After lunch, A Lin suddenly disappeared without a trace. Xiao was convinced that she had been abducted by He. She remembered that He was acquainted with the wet nurse Shen and detained Shen. She went to the matchmaker's shop on Nancang Street to investigate. The matchmaker's shop, because it was responsible, immediately sent people out to search for her. At about 3 pm, they found A Lin waiting for a boat with He at the Guanqiao Wharf. They immediately took them to Haichao Temple Street and reported to Zhang Wenjin, the watchman of the twenty-sixth post in that area, and brought them back to the First District Third Precinct. Jin, the precinct chief, presented the case for a preliminary hearing. Because the case involved the abduction of a young girl, he ordered that a document be prepared and sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>▲ Hu's Request for Redemption Denied</p>
<p>Hu Yingyi, a 25-year-old from Guangdong, went to the An Le Palace dance hall on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession on the evening of April 24th this year to drink and dance with the dance hostesses several times. He paid with a Hong Kong bank note worth 100 yuan, equivalent to 14 silver dollars, instructing them to find him 86 silver dollars in change. The hall owner discovered that the note was counterfeit. He later learned that Hu was hiding in the Da Dong Hotel in the International Settlement. He immediately reported this to the French police station, which sent detectives to arrest him. It turned out that the defendant had also committed a similar offense of using counterfeit money in the International Settlement and had been arrested by detectives and brought before the Special District Court. After interrogation, he was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment and fined 1,400 yuan. A few days ago, detectives from the French police station went to bring Hu before the French court. First, the manager of An Le Palace, Zhang Xingfa, recounted the previous events. When questioned, Hu Yingyi confessed that the counterfeit banknote was obtained when he sold a ring to a civilian in Hong Kong for 400 yuan. He claimed he had not dared to counterfeit it himself and that he was dissatisfied with the sentence imposed by the Special District Court and had filed an appeal. After hearing the case, the Chinese and Western judges determined that the defendant had indeed used counterfeit money and sentenced him to one year in the Western prison as a warning to others. The defendant requested to be allowed to pay a fine to avoid imprisonment, but the court rejected his request.</p>

<p>Yesterday's newspaper carried a notice stating that "Lawyer Yu Zuwang has been appointed as the permanent legal counsel for Mr. Gong Jiliang of Zhujiage." The notice stated that the lawyer has been retained by Mr. Gong Jiliang as his permanent legal counsel and that any infringement of his legal rights would be protected by law. Furthermore, Gong Jiliang has a concubine named Shunqin, and in order to respect women's rights, she is being granted her freedom and provided with silver dollars, clothing, and jewelry. Shunqin has independently stated that she is severing all familial ties with the Gong family, and that she is free to choose another partner, with no further connection to the Gong family. This statement is being made on their behalf. Unexpectedly, after the advertisement was published, there was also a former deputy captain of the detective team of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, currently an employee of the Golden Grand Theater, also named Gong Jiliang, whose courtesy name was also Jiliang and who was from Songjiang, not far from Zhujiage. Therefore, those familiar with Gong believed that the advertisement must refer to this Gong. Consequently, since yesterday evening, inquiries have been incessant. Mr. Gong was initially unaware of this until he inspected the newspaper himself, at which point he could not help but laugh. However, Mr. Gong's father is currently employed in another province and, fearing that the news would cause a misunderstanding, sent a letter last night to preemptively explain the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Peasant Art <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Written by Yamamoto Kanae, translated by Chen Baoyi (Part 1)</p>
<p>Regarding peasant art (L’Art Rustique), although some books have been published on it in England, France, Germany, Russia, Italy, etc., there does not seem to be a comprehensive historical account like those of general art. It is mostly introduced from the perspective of folklore research or industrial inspection.</p>
<p>According to anthropological research, the origins of peasant art date back to the eleventh and twelfth centuries. It was significantly developed among the rural villagers in northern Sweden, which was once the cultural center of the ancient Western Hemisphere (see Adachi's "Swedish Peasant Art"). Although it is generally referred to as peasant art, it is not limited to peasants but also found among fishermen and herders. However, the wood carvings and inlaid woodwork made by herders in the Austrian Highlands are called L’Art Pastoral (shepherd art) by folklore researchers. In short, wherever people lived in the past, there was some form of peasant art. In ancient times, all necessities of life were self-sufficient. Before there were specialized workers or shops, household utensils and ornaments were made by everyone themselves. Even today, in remote and secluded places similar to ancient times, everything is still self-sufficient. For example, in our country (Japan), the indigenous areas of Taiwan are like this. Originally, since they became Japanese citizens and goods could be bought with money, their L’Art Rustique has almost disappeared. However, even now, the houses they live in, such as the main pillars of the houses, the ancestral images used in ceremonies, the beautiful clothes worn during rituals, the weapons with relief carvings on the sheaths and handles, the wine cups shared by two people, the bamboo harmonicas, the rattan hats, and the unglazed water jars, are all works of the indigenous villages. We call these self-made crafts "self-use crafts" in classification.</p>
<p>In the past, all peasant art was self-use craft. Although it cannot be said that everything was made by the user's own hands, it generally refers to the decorative crafts made in the countryside by individuals, families, villages, or local communities for their own use. It seems appropriate to call this L’Art Rustique. Among this kind of peasant art, Scandinavia is the richest in examples. For example, large tapestries woven with stripes or patterns, large furniture with relief carvings of vine-like patterns, and beautiful mats and vests embroidered with flowers are all exquisite and unique.</p>
<p>The first impression of the characteristic peasant art of Switzerland can be felt from the architecture. The farmhouses (Chalet or Dwellings) in the Alps often have round stones on their roofs, and the eaves, windows, and cabinets are decorated with relief carvings. The characteristic of Switzerland is mostly woodwork and wood carvings, such as wardrobes, cradles, snow sleds, chairs, and wooden clocks. These are all complete works of art and craft. Herders who live far from people in the mountains probably still make their own supplies like the ancients.</p>
<p>A book records... (Herders are not just herdsmen, but also craftsmen, carpenters, and artists. They do not hold pens, but rather knives as artists, creators, and Altists, especially sculptors. Pens and paper are not their tools, but knives are always with them. They use knives to carve their imaginations onto pieces of Swiss pine or larch wood. Human figures, wild or domestic livestock, and other creatures, flowers and plants are natural and natural models for them.) Gold and silver thread embroidery and hand-woven fabrics are famous peasant arts of Belgium and the joyful work of mountain village women during the winter.</p>
<p>[When snow falls and strong winds blow for one or two weeks continuously, there are desolate cold nights. Heavy snow prevents the traces of pedestrians and buries beautiful villages in all white. Inside the house, homemade dried cheese is placed on a handmade tablecloth. After a happy family dinner, the women cheerfully take out spindles and spinning wheels on long cold nights, take out needle sticks for making lace from small boxes with relief carvings, or spread out embroidery tools under the lamp, or sit at the loom by the window. The well-used shuttles, passed down from grandmothers in ancient times, are used to weave threads with momentum.</p>
<p>Look, the loom goes *thump thump karari*</p>
<p>The maiden making a living is *happy even in her expression*</p>
<p>The sounds of songs being sung as they work leak out from each household, || and during the summer, patterns copied from grass and trees are unfolded,</p>
<p>and colored threads are traced on beautiful cloth.</p>
<p>In such a cold winter scene, their decorative crafts are thus completed.</p>
<p>Italian peasant art was also once prosperous. Chiseled gold and silver filigree with painted patterns, unglazed pottery with blue and yellow colors, embroidery lace, hand-woven fabrics, and woodwork are quite rich.</p>
<p>Even in Germany, peasant art was once widespread. It is described in German books as follows:</p>
<p>From the external decoration of houses to the smallest decorations in clothing, but belonging to rural crafts, interior decoration furniture, utensils, kiln products, metal handicrafts, decorative clothing, temple supplies, and the walls around cemeteries, gardens, and houses, that is, all these techniques of carving, inlaying, stonemasonry, painting, pottery, weaving, embroidery, machine weaving, blacksmithing, and filigree of precious metals are included. These products are the result of hard work during the winter and are mostly made by rural artisans.</p>
<p>Even in France, Austria, and Hungary, peasant art was once prosperous. France is known for its lace and white thread embroidery, while Austria and Hungary are known for their wood crafts with inlaid metal fittings, and wool-woven brocade tapestries or tablecloths. In short, in the same era, roughly the same peasant art was practiced in all other European countries. Where did the rural villagers of the time learn their designs and techniques? Mainly from temple art. Therefore, this peasant art method has Gothic or Byzantine styles, and their farmers have simple tastes and honest methods. Unknowingly, it has created a simple and profound style. As for taking the delicate Louis style as important, being tired of the strong quirks of the new art, and gradually feeling dissatisfied with the unstable geometric Secession (Note A) || Europe's recent art world, on its path to regeneration, can afford to pay attention to the peasant art of the past. It is a big, understandable matter.</p>
<p>(Note A: Secession, which began in 1897)</p>
<p>(A new style in Austria that separated from traditional classical art)</p>
<p>With the spread of stores and the rise of factories, and with the end of the era of self-sufficiency, peasant art also almost disappeared. Like the end of the Warring States period, spears and swords became antiques. Peasant art, which was once a favorite item of rural villagers, also became an antique and was transported from the countryside to collection halls or scholars and artists. Today, it is impossible to see the above-mentioned self-use crafts in farmhouses. The peasant art made today is not for personal use, but for sale, just like the vegetables or fruits made by farmers to meet the needs of the city. However, it is an industry. Therefore, peasant art like today is, first of all, unnecessary and unharmonious in the lives of the farmers who make it, but the authors can earn money from those products and also enjoy their art work. However, this is exactly the opposite of the peasant art of the past. The peasant art of the past was intimately harmonized with the author's environment and was probably a cherished object that they did not want to exchange for money. Here we can divide peasant art into two types: ||</p>
<p>A. Peasant art for self-use craft (most of the peasant art in ancient times belonged to this type)</p>
<p>B. Peasant art for industrial craft (most of the peasant art today belongs to this type)</p>
<p>In short, with the modern economic situation, A has disappeared and B has risen. The rise of B and the fact that it is being encouraged in various countries have two legitimate reasons: first, to attach importance to peasant art from the standpoint of folk education in the face of the desolation of rural life today; and second, to focus interest on its development as a reflection of urban taste and mechanical production. Dr. Chonglai, the chairman of the Rural Welfare and Local Customs Association in Germany, once said (handicrafts and craft skills were accompanied by self-use crafts everywhere in the countryside, fulfilling its</p>
<p>Turkish children learning new alphabets</p>
<p>astonishing development. Household utensils, implements, and everything were made and repaired by farmers with knives, chisels, hammers, and saws, to a certain extent artistically, practically, sturdily, and with a unique charm. Thus, even during the winter, farmers, families, servants, and laborers all had sufficient work, and the work rooms of each farmer became a place for implementing manual education. Today, the carvings, metalwork, machine weaving, embroidery, and other works of art from peasant hands that are displayed in many museums are made by the rough hands of farmers engaged in threshing, feeding livestock, or cultivating the land. Those unique crafts or utensils can now hardly be seen in farmhouses. The things that farmers used to make themselves in their homes during the winter off-season must now be bought from factories. Factory products are cheaper, but their durability is far inferior to the manual work of farmers in their free time. If it is only a question of how to obtain such utensils in the easiest and cheapest way, then we probably would not express any different opinions regarding this change. However, the problem is much more serious. Along with the decline of self-use crafts and handicrafts, the character of the local people has lost one of its most solid characteristics. Taste education and extremely unique artistic ideas have disappeared or degenerated. Practical skills and adaptability to all manual operations have become increasingly weakened. We must be aware of this matter as a folk education problem. Why? It is because, due to the increasing development of mechanical industry, most of the winter labor of the local people has been encroached upon, and the leisure time that should be used for manual work is far more than in the past. Therefore, in folk education, we always demand that the self-use crafts and other manual skills that were once popular, which have now disappeared, be revived through manual education under a certain direction.)</p>

<h3 id="e193">New Uses for Wood Flour <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Wood flour was used in Germany during the European War, but many people still consider it unreliable and insufficient to replace other materials. However, in many places in the United States, it is gradually being used for flooring, shelves, and wall coatings, and wood flour has become an industry. The United States has a history of forty years, with an average annual output of more than 24,000 tons. The Scandinavian countries and Germany produce 6,000 tons of sales in the Atlantic coast of the United States each year. The main uses are mostly in the manufacture of stoppers, rubber, and tarpaulins. Even for statues, New York uses 5,000 tons each year. More than 75% of these wood flours in the United States are from white pine sawing, and the rest are mostly from poplar, palm, alder wood and maple wood. Now because of the high cost of sawing, the high cost is not easy to transport. The inconvenience is being engaged in improvement. This kind of wood sawing in China is equal to waste wood flour in the United States, but it has become a major industry, and it is felt that the Chinese are doing foolish things when sawing wood, throwing away hundreds of items on the ground. It is hoped that someone will pay attention to the use of this waste, which will also provide a small subsidy to the national economy. (Yi Kang)</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Future of Radio News Transmission <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Currently, the San Francisco Daily News in the United States has been read by the New York Total Electric Company by machine three hours after publication. In the future, what can be transmitted is a 38-inch strip, which can be transmitted by radio. Other radio photographs can also be transmitted at the same time. However, the San Francisco Daily News obtained by radio transmission is not the original form, but an 8-inch rolled paper printed by the radio company. This 8-inch rolled paper is printed by a machine that can print half an inch per minute. The entire contents of the San Francisco Daily News can be read on the 8-inch rolled paper in about four minutes. This rolled paper is specially made into a rolled type for printing (Yi Kang)</p>

<p>The Italian government has decided to build a giant and beautiful Mediterranean ship like a palace, as other countries have gorgeous and spectacular ships, and Italy is in urgent need of this equipment. In addition to ordinary equipment, there will be churches, swimming pools, sports grounds, theaters, and airports. It is planned to be 887 feet long, 97 feet wide, weighing 45,000 tons, and the horsepower will be increased to 90,000 horsepower, traveling at 27 nautical miles per hour. The people living on the ship must be people on the Italian coastline, and each room will have a wireless telephone to communicate with each other. This plan has been actively implemented by the government and is expected to be successful next year. (Yi Kang)</p>
<h3 id="e196">Research on Radio Transmission from the Moon <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Radio in the United States has made great progress thanks to the efforts of researchers. However, there is still no practical evidence for the experiment of broadcasting radio signals to the moon. However, Dr. A. Hoyt Taylor, fleet radio engineer of the Naval Experimental Chemical Laboratory, has spent a long time researching this experiment. The doctor hopes that the moon's surface can reflect a signal to the ground when the moon is only 250,000 miles from the earth. It is expected that the specially set Hertzian wave can travel 186,000 miles per second. In two and a half seconds, the signal reflected by the surface of the moon can be received in Washington. The doctor is currently researching this matter. The radio industry believes that the success of this experiment will open a new era, because radio recently broadcast from New York to Celle, Austria, and the reflection reply was obtained in a short period of time.

<p>▲ The Franco-Chinese Pharmacy announces that this year's "Double Lion" brand mosquito incense, a domestic product, has been produced with even greater improvements than in previous years. All materials and decoration have also been improved. As a result, sales are consistently strong both locally and in other regions. The factory's products are in high demand, with supply often falling short of demand. Each box comes with a metal burning tray; once lit, mosquitoes will die and users can sleep soundly without worry.</p>
<p>▲ Maochang Optical Company on Mintuan Road, west of the Old North Gate, announces that since the establishment of their low-price department, the store has been bustling with customers. Their optical fittings are precise, and those who require myopia glasses have been universally full of praise.

<p>▲ Daguan Bookstore, located at 210 Fangxie Road, Ximen (West Gate), is a bookstore specializing in literary and party-oriented books. After a month of preparation, it has officially commenced business on the 10th (the day before yesterday). On that day, there were many guests and the female staff provided attentive service. Currently, during the initial opening period, the prices of all books are particularly affordable. They sincerely welcome patronage from all walks of life.

<p>▲ The Sino-Western Pharmacy main store on Fourth Road announces that, given the recent hot weather and prevalence of epidemics, they are offering various summer epidemic prevention drugs at particularly low prices for two weeks. There will also be various free gifts, such as fans, perfumes, gift vouchers, and tickets to the Great World amusement park. In the eyes of customers, when spending money to buy goods, naturally those who can get free gifts will be preferred. Therefore, the pharmacy has been crowded with customers for days, and the staff is busy, with supply often falling short of demand. Especially at sunset, the number of customers is even greater. It is reported that in these two or three days, the sales of Epidemic Prevention Water, Merit, and Water Brandy amount to more than 27,000 boxes per day.</p>
<p>▲ Yanhua Restaurant, opposite the Dangui No. 1 Stage on Fourth Road, announces that their cold drink section is well-equipped and has ample ventilation.

<p>▲ Hanli Company announces that their newly invented Zhongling pneumatic printing press, from the beginning, was priced extremely low in order to make it accessible to all and facilitate printing. Recently, the price of gold has skyrocketed and all goods have become more expensive. All industries have announced price increases. However, Zhongling Printing Machine wants to maintain its reputation as a domestic product and defeat foreign goods, so it would rather suffer losses itself and dare not raise prices. At a time when the scorching heat prevails, and there are many documents in the military, government, commercial, and academic sectors, every stroke of the pen causes sweat to flow down the back. If the Zhongling Military is used, tens of thousands of papers can be completed in an instant, and they are unusually clear. What a refreshing and convenient way to save time and money! No wonder everyone is happy to buy it. Furthermore, since the company posted advertisements to recruit provincial managers, within three days, major stores in Guizhou, Sichuan, and Liaoning provinces have ordered managers and shipped back large quantities of printing machines to promote sales within their provincial areas.</p>
<p>▲ Zhonghua Enamel Factory announces that they have added a Penglai retail store to facilitate retail customers and revitalize the South City market.
