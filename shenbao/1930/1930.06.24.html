<p>（南京）津關事件、據某方談、津領團雖企圖代辦通關事務、但此間當局、認爲領事官之職權、决不能干預到中國内政、而代行管理財政之權、且各國已認國民政府爲中國合法政府、何得對於中國政府之叛逆者、予以直接及間接之幫助、而妨碍中國政府對内命令之權威、此種離奇辦法、在國際間、决不至共同采取、津關華洋關員、原各有相當地位、必不肯附和辛博森、而自外中國政府優厚之待遇苟不加以暴力脅迫、定能一致離開職務、所指定代徵津關稅欵之江海粤海厦門青島大連安東秦皇島營口等八關、已先後電告總稅務司、即行照辦、至於日軍艦封銷大沽口檢查進口商輪之辦法、亦將實行、如此星羅棋布、商船對代徵津關稅欵之處置、必無法規避、最近一週間、津關所担保外債之舊稅、聞尚匯交上海匯豐銀行、至新稅中所担保内債部分、閻錫山雖欲扣留而亦不能、因閻正在借重或要挾北方銀團幫忙時期若施以攫奪手段、更足引起銀行界之恐慌、其可取得者、不過有限之關餘、因此欵在形式上雖存於天津交行、而朝存夕提、該行自無力拒絶、總稅司梅樂和頃向財部建議、欲將海關稅超然於政治漩渦之外、中央認爲中國關稅向來統一、不受政治影響、此次破壞海關制度、責任固自有人負之也、（二十三日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）外王今晨在外部紀念週報告、一週來最離奇之事、有令吾人注意者、即英人辛博森强制接收海關是、此事醖釀已久、以閻之爲人、首鼠兩端、毫無决心、而竟有是舉實受辛所唆使、窺辛之意、蓋欲傾津關收入供閻軍費、藉售其功、殊不知國　府自宣佈關稅自主後、對此事可用内政方法解决、天津旣爲逆踞、故暫令津關人員離開、由附近海關代徵貨稅但天津仍在閻範圍内、商人於附近海關納稅後、至津不免重徵、結果津關封鎖、商業停滯、辛此舉徒庸人自擾而已然吾人對此尚須研究者、辛以一外人、明目張膽、助紂爲虐、反對友邦承認之國府、觸犯刑律、難辭其辜、國府對彼將來自有相當處置、查外人助逆反抗駐在國政府、侵害友邦安寗、爲國際公法所不容、以英政府素日立國治政之精神而論、吾深信當不能任辛之擾亂、以損其美德而毁法紀故吾人以法治眼光觀之、辛將被制裁、殆無疑義、（二十三日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）頃訪中政會外交組某委、詢政府對津領團擬代辦津關收稅事、據答此事英日主張最力、美法猶未同意、現各國正向各該政府請訓、我政府對此舉、正在研究辦法、萬一領團竟貿然實行當有明白表示、至外交組方面胡漢民·譚延闓·王寵惠·王正廷等委員、於上星期六、·曾一度研究此事、但並無開會形式、對津領團代辦稅收事、僉以各國尚未明顯表示態度、故政府亦未便先行表示意見、須俟各國態度表明後、再商對付辦法、現在吾人所希望於英使者、祇望其能實行我國主張、將助逆之辛博森驅逐出境、並予以相當處罰耳、（二十三日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）英駐津總領事茄來司來平、見藍使、報告津關接收所生各種情形、及辛博生舉措與貝泐之陳述、共打成一小册、藍氏未表示辦法、僅謂應由總稅務司梅兹善後、又辛派某美人辦塘沽分局、關於放關掛燈掛旗等、均未照向例、故英日商、仍將稅欵交領事館轉納華關、又茄來司與日使館方面、亦有所陳述、（二十三日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）荷使歐氏語予、津關係國領事會議海關事、華報每用領事團名稱不準確、因在津無租界及無關商務之領事、未全參加、會議應稱關係國領事會議云、又津關係國領事、將梅兹聲明、膠滬連關代收津關稅、與滬運津之入口稅、滬關先征等事、請辛博森謀一妥善辦法、以免外商重複納稅、（二十三日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）津關辛博森派俄人魯克曼勞夫爲理船廳總巡、及新職員十二人、至舊印已覓到、大沽口分所不承認新印問題、現補印舊印、秦皇島分開封鎖問題、經張學良電致貝泐、照常開關、仍由副稅務司英人安乃等主持、貝請示總稅司再定、（二十三日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）美使館對津海關問題、迭得英日兩國方面之通報後、使館請示外部、旋得覆、美國只問僑商之便利、至關稅如何徵收、或何方派人徵收、不必問、應注意徵收手續是否完備、若如前辦法、亦可就地納稅、不必由領事代存、以省手續、總之、不使美商因中國爭關而受時間與經濟之損失云、（二十三日專電）</p>
<p>（天津）聞領事團今晨續開會議、議决呈請各本國使署承認接管海關爲已成事實之舉、津關今日辦公似甚忙碌、惟以多屬新手、故手續不免凌亂、辛博森稱、目下難關已過、一星期内當有得力之人員可供指揮、内有德籍舊關員若干、前因政治原因而被開除者、聞投効者薪給頗豐、至貝泐手下之關員、除中國扦手若干人外、餘悉遵總稅務司之訓令迄未報到、（二十三日路透社電）</p>

<p>古語有云。衣食足而後知榮辱。凡屬人類。不甚相遠也。人第知富强之國。秩序整然。内亂不起。政爭不烈。以爲其國人民咸顧大局。而不知悉由於國民之經濟充裕。百業悉舉。各有生活。國家政府之財政充裕。應付得平。即有一二齟齬。大體皆得行其是。假使一旦而國民經濟窮迫。多數之人。難謀生路。則其國之治安。必無不生影響者。假使一旦而國家之財政困乏。遇事左支右絀。則政治上之應付。决不能平。而政爭必因之而烈。而所謂失序整然者必因之而摇動。此非我之過言也。準諸人情之常理而莫可逃避者也。</p>
<p>昔於歐戰之時。我嘗屢言之。人當生死危急之秋。其舉動不甚相遠。凡足以張已之勢。挫敵之威者。無所不用其極。宣傳之方法。與隱飾之說詞。以及求人相助之狀態。與世界甚他人類。如出一轍。一旦戰事旣息。生死危急之難關旣過。而儼然自傲之態。又復如舊矣。今則世界之戰禍已過。而世界經濟之恐慌又生。苟長此不已。歷時較久。則凡世界所謂富强之國民者。他日其國内之爭。國内之亂。國内之治安不能維持。或且過於今日之不富强之國。亦未可知。是以知人類至窮迫之時之不甚相遠也。</p>

<h3>津關職員未到</h3>
<p>津方無電報告消息沉寂</p>
<p>自晋閻任命辛博森長津海關以來、總稅務司曾訓令津關全體職員離職、本報記者、昨至總稅務司署訪晤副稅務司、據云、自前項訓令發出後、天津方面消息沉寂、亦無來電報告、究竟如何、眞相不明、最近津關職員並無來滬者、事實更難明瞭、此後應付、採取何種步驟、尚難預定、原任稅務司貝爾、因在津與離職員司辦理種種事務、一時恐不能來滬云、</p>
<p>自北方强占天津稅關、國府嚴重表示後、日代理公使重光、曾電日政府請示、並將天津日領辦理稅銀等情、詳細報告、昨日重光代理公使、已接外務省訓令、令從速制止天津日領代收稅銀等行動、一方由外務省研究辦法、再行續電重光代使、表示意見、重光接電後、已轉電令知天津日領、停止代收稅銀、及其他行動矣、</p>
<p>商人對付</p>
<h3>津關稅問題</h3>
<p>洋商交領署</p>
<p>華商無辦法</p>
<p>北方强收津關事起、滬上北洋航輪、與商貨出口營業、均聯帶發生重大影響、而關稅問題、更有特殊辦法之産生、兹將昨日關於此事情形、分記如下、</p>
<p>洋商納稅新法江海關宣布、上海赴津出口貨、應納之正半兩稅、因北方强收津關、各貨到津時所付之進口半稅、亦須在上海出口時附帶繳納、本埠各洋商對於此事、已經討論多次、以此項半稅之付滬付津、與洋商本不生問題、第慮到津時、如北方仍欲强征、則大受損失兹聞各洋商議定、援昔年孫傳芳加征關稅時之成例、將運津洋商貨之進口半稅、雙方各不交付、暫請各本國之領署代收、一面則通告津滬兩關、謂俟該問題得到正式解决時、再將稅欵移劃、洋商貨之結關手續、亦改由各領事署代辦、昨聞已經决定、而天津方面之洋商、亦照此辦理、</p>
<p>疋頭雜糧停運天津疋頭去路、方在開始購運、近日突然發生奪關風潮、滬上各客帮因慮繳納二重稅之損失、又未能如洋商之假重領判權爲護符、故自昨日起、各華商業已停止裝載疋頭貨及雜糧等往天津矣、從今日起、滬上之北洋班輪出口貨、更形缺乏、所裝者、僅爲零星貨物云、</p>
<p>英輪兼行大連上海三公司北洋正班輪、向來不往大連、僅灣烟台及威海衛兩地、兹因海關改變收稅、與命令更易起卸津貨問題、昨日、英商怡和洋行議定、將正班天津船改灣大連灣、藉以補救進出口貨之清表云、</p>
<p>市社會局嚴禁</p>
<h3>水手帶米出境</h3>
<p>並取締非法交易之米店</p>
<p>市社會局、近據市民報稱、海關對於出口各輪食米、原有規定數量、如開往美國者一百三十三包、開往英國者一百包等、但水手等每於關員查騐以後、乘機偷帶、或則以同一關單重復裝載、朦蔽關吏、外虹口一帶及對面浦東各米店、即營此項交易、與水手互相勾結、總計每年漏出之上等食米、爲數頗鉅等語、該局當以本市民食、年來常陷於恐慌地步、似此朦混夾帶出口、非特有損海關規例、抑且妨害本市民食、因即函請江海關監督公署、轉飭稅務司、通飭各關員、嚴密稽查、復訓令米號業團體整理委員會、告誡同業、不得營此非法交易、並責成該會、如再違犯、據實舉發、以憑究辦、</p>

<p>死灰復燃之謀、兹果於白克路懷德里二百十三號設立輪賭之塲矣、該屋爲二樓二底賭塲、設於樓上、一切佈置、極其精密、外表亦甚奐輪、不知者多目爲</p>
<p>世室住宅凡往賭之人、苟無稔者介紹、不特難以升堂入室、即門首徘徊、猶遭斥逐、該塲成立以來、頗經時日、警務機關毫無所覺、近數日間、總巡捕房探目陸根弟微有所聞、以地屬新閘捕房轄境、因告知該捕房探長王長根、特别注意、每至深夜、王探長輙獨往賭場附近伺察、見出入之人、終宵鮮斷、連偵四五夜、</p>
<p>料係賭窟無疑、乃於上星期六（二十一）夜間、協同副探長曹阿三·探目陸根弟·及中西捕頭鮑永順·等密往、先將該屋包圍、以免漏網、嗣始推扉而入、緣梯登樓、各賭徒正興高彩烈、欲避無從、有躱往廂房中者、亦有下樓圖逃者、然卒被</p>

<h3>記溧陽一怪獄莊嚴</h3>
<p>此案發生於去春。去今已十餘月。似無可記。然今尚在上訴中。全國最高法院已定於本年八月間開審此案。則兹稿亦尚不失爲一新聞也。</p>
<p>緣有江寗人王毅者。任職於溧陽南渡之公安分避。其人年事尚輕。頗有儍氣。平日於境内烟賭。查治甚嚴。當地賭徒深銜之。去年二月間某夜。正值舊歷新年。王與其局中同事黃范二人飲於市樓。略醉。忽有一人坌息至。報告鄉南某宅有人聚賭。王等即令導往查捕。而派范回局報信。糾人爲助。乃甫出酒館。報信者已踪跡杳然。時夜定更深。萬籟俱寂。此處地點荒僻。相傳有鬼。黃見報信者一轉眼即失所在。事出蹊蹺。意頗怯。王則少年任性。力謂無妨。遂相偕前進。甫行數十武。忽見街旁大餅肆前立一童子。燈光黯淡之下。見其面赤如棗。雙目炯炯。王叱問爲誰。童默然不答。黃見大餅肆門已閉。而童緊守冷爐之側不去。不無可疑。遂欲執而搜之。童遽狂奔。王黃乃嘈逐於其後。循一塘疾走。一轉瞬間。童之踪跡又渺然。王黃方相顧錯愕。立聞桑樹旁之小茅屋中。有牌聲刮刮。王等遂趨前偵視。果見屋中有數人聚賭牌九。黃某身携手槍。乃釋而畀之王。令監守於門首。已則入内捕捉。有一朱姓賭徒。適立近門側。以爲可逃也。急啓門向外奔逸。黑暗中與王相撞。王被撞倒地。揪打間手槍走險。彈丸中朱腦際。朱負傷狂奔。約十餘武。即傷重而死。事後經溧陽縣政府審訊。判以殺人罪。處死刑。聞者咸以爲寃。王旋上訴於蘇高等法院。改處無期徒刑。王以殺人罪仍不能豁免。心殊不甘。遂復上訴於最高法院也。</p>
<p>談者謂王朱並無夙讐。何以有此惡果。且黑夜放槍。無論如何。亦不會如此準確。因證以報信者及餅肆童子之忽隱忍現。以爲遇鬼。而歎爲前生寃孽云。</p>

<p>中西女塾。亦於前晚（二十一日）舉行音樂會。該校在海上素負盛譽。我早就想去觀光。恰逢良緣。誰肯錯過。趨車前往。費半小時之久。進了校門。再穿過一條濃蔭蔽天的曲徑。遠遠的洋樓。隱約可望。淺草如茵。園林繁茂。相映成趣。霎時衆賓齊來。閨秀實佔多數。走進了會塲。便寂寂無聲。秩序井然。尋常集會中。不易多見。八時開幕。逐節奏演。至第十六節爲止。有各級學生的會唱。獨唱。有鋼琴獨奏。合奏。除了一兩節應用樂器外。都是吟唱。而且十之九是西歌。祇鳳陽花鼓與板橋道情是國粹。但音調彷彿已經歐化。來賓中有幾位長者。聽得莫明其妙。不啻身臨西洋劇塲。不怪他們興致索然。其中有兩節是ＲhythmicOlchestra；RhythmicOrchestraaudChorus這兩節很有精采。所用的樂器。有鐘。鼓。木魚。銅鈴。鋼琴。梵啞林。參合吹奏。眞所謂中西合璧。博得掌聲不少。殷芝卿（譯音）女士之鋼琴獨奏。指法極諳熟。蕭其偉（譯音）女士之獨唱。音韻幽揚。最爲出色。此次音樂會就大體看來。頗稱美滿、可惜所唱偏於西洋詞曲。吟唱多而樂奏少。難免美中不足。</p>
<p>音樂會中登臺者至少有二百人。紡綢素裝。服飾整齊。普通平民化的學校中。誠難辦到。可是諸位女士們。體格都不甚强健。隨處露出「弱不禁風」的樣兒。美則美矣。其如不健何。更有一點。在這許多女士中間。不束胸的不止十數。此種妨害女子體育的陋習。已成中國女子的通病。關係國民健康。何等重大。西洋女子以乳房發達爲健康。中國女子以乳房緊縮爲美觀。錯念旣深。解放不易。甚望先覺女子。竭力提倡。實行「放胸」。以養成「健而美」的體格。</p>
<h3>律和票房堂會記老拙</h3>
<p>月之十九日爲徐固卿先生七秩大慶。先是徐氏滬上之親友。僉謀發起爲先生稱觴上壽。頗有一番舉動。固老素以寗靜爲懷。不願舖張。力沮其議而罷。而律和票社謝葆生洪子儀二君。以固老一生負社會之重望。值此古稀誕辰。奚可默默無所表示。因就律和票社。集合社中同人。彩排一日。藉伸公祝之意。是日劇目凡十有二。予晚飯後至。所獲觀者。則僅四齣。略紀如次。一紅鸞喜。未帶捧打。戎君伯銘飾金玉奴。描寫標梅及期。獲遇才郎。不肯輕輕放過。演來不即不離。一顰一笑。恰合閨門旦身分。謝葆生飾金松。談知風生。臺功義練。次戴貴榮演珠簾寨。亦僅半齣。戴君吃調雖不高。而行腔轉落。頗見輕靈。具見匠心。次三本鐵公鷄。謝文元飾張嘉祥。孫蘭亭飾向榮。劉從俠飾鐵金翅。方善珍王愼聲飾師爺。是劇配搭齊整。堪稱完璧。謝君年事甚輕。平日淬厲技擊。孜孜不倦。每當表演武劇。眞有一夫奮勇。萬夫辟易之概。就其臺藝而論。殊不弱於蓋五也。孫君文武兼賅。而尤擅長化子拾金一則。生旦凈丑。無或不</p>
<h3>南洋游記（三四）靈花</h3>
<p>四月一日。友人約觀爪哇戲。天下事思想與事實常相差甚遠。余心中之爪哇。乃與所見之爪哇人有天淵之殊。因余生平主義在於花好月圓人壽。甘露降。醴泉出。鳳凰現。麒麟遊。故嚴守邵康節之語。生平不作皺眉事。世上應無切齒人。皺眉事即俗云麻煩事也。在國内屢聞到爪哇爲甚麻煩。故不願履其地。不願見其人。甚至有麻煩事。我不願聞其名此余生平爲人態度。亦將來欲創造新世界之境界也。乃至此間。有友人等屢言爪哇之好。遠過英屬。有林超之者。生於爪哇。曾在北京清華學校及上海辦電報通信社。昔年曾以荷蘭文譯科大同學案傳於荷屬。其言日。荷屬爪哇。華人無拉洋車者。均當商。其地位與西人平等。舉例如男女跳舞場。在英屬華人不大可舉行。因西人認華人程度不齊。而荷屬則極自由。各戲院三等之座。罕有華人。故華人地位甚高。若英屬乃華工人社會居多。窮人遍地。因之華人地位。大受影響。蓋荷屬華人拉洋車之事。曾由報界鼓吹取消。爲爭華人體面也。</p>
<p>余心中之爪哇。大抵荷蘭政府爲不人道之政府。而爪哇之地必污促不堪。爪哇人應亦窮陋醜惡之悉人耳。故不願踐其地。不願見其人。今觀此地有爪哇戲。賣票票價頭等三元。次等一元半。余以爲此等應與馬猴戲相埓。何以如此之貴價乎。乃因林君之鼓吹。居然一試。爪哇音樂頗優美。其布置亦雅麗。跳舞女人種在西人與華人之間。殊美雇雅健大方。其布置爪哇之景。則濃麗壯闊。富厚潔凈。覺得别有天地。似果在英屬以上。至其表演。總之凡有雄性活動。不外打殺。吾遍觀各戲。凡雄性之表演總是殺。所以我敢斷定非女性過半數。不能造大同。雄性爲大同時代之危險性也。雄性不敢造。人道永無希望。馬克司只知麵包。不知若漢之七國晋之八王唐太宗父子兄弟相殺。明建文成祖叔侄相殺。何嘗爲此麵包。在虚榮與壞制度故耳。我觀爪哇女性之優美。而一加人雄性。不外持刀互殺。對女逼姦。此千古雄性之一轍。余敢决斷判雄性爲雄匪者也。滔滔者無雄不匪。不能不思西王母國與鏡花緣之女兒國矣。考元史。爪哇當元時。本女國。與羅斛女國同入貢。今觀其女果可觀。其男女均因與西種混合。故特優美。將來非世界人種混合。不能生新優美人種也。友人云。非利賓人種混合後。所生之新人種好看又聰明。此爲余東方大同學案中新大同學六綱之第三綱新人種主義也。余經此次參觀爪哇人之戲。乃知有許多事思想靠不住。有時相反者。甚可笑也。</p>
<p>表演爪哇故事。其語言我不能通。不過歌聲及表情則可見。此爪哇樂團亦不久回爪哇。所歌者爲别離之歌。甚形悲哀。蓋不問人種異同。生死離别。喜怒哀樂。自有同情。此大同所以可到也。甚至仙佛超世。亦不離此。人間天上。同爲有情。所以　亦由此而成神仙佛境也歟。</p>
<p>能。無或不肖。可稱劇博士。劉君素長架子花臉。是劇唱流水板一節。旣詼諧。又極動聽。方王二君均便便大腹。二人爭論時。操其不甚純粹之紹興土白。引得全塲軒渠不置。末劇御碑亭。孫鈞卿飾王有道。賀稚英飾孟月華。孫賀二君扮相俱佳。孫摹仿馬連良。頗有似處而其扮相之瀟灑。連良所不及也。演至是劇。已鐘鳴十二下。未待劇罷。怱遽言歸。特爲濡筆記之。</p>
<p>短訊玉霜霧主程艶秋。此次在瀋演唱堂會。兩日中計演宇宙鋒祭塔玉堂春風流流捧奇雙會五劇。一時目爲鐵嗓。聞當時並與張學良之三弟串演黃金台。張去伊立。程反串老生。居然佳構。演畢擬即返平。因哈爾濱官商各界電懇閻澤漙張學銘等。邀請赴哈演唱陜災救濟會義務戲。玉霜慨允九日到哈。官商各界到站歡迎者二百餘人。准十日在大丁洋電影院演唱。首夕碧玉簪。次夕夕鴛鴦塜。三夕風流棒。義務演完。續演營業戲數日。票價包箱一百元。散座十元。五日戲票。全行售罄。約二十日左右即可返平。刻大連方面。託陳某邀請。已經辭謝。圍因滬上某舞臺邀請甚力。秋問或須南下。與滬人士重見云。（平）</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二一九）包天笑</h3>
<p>第十二回别宴離筵拈花留倩影名園嘉會鬭茗覩芳姿</p>
<p>從來一般在堂子裏白相相的朋友。對於一位美麗。漂亮的。年紀很輕的姑娘。被一個有錢的人討了去。貯諸金屋。好像似滿燦燿的一株花。本來大家可以欣賞的。現在被一個人掘了去。成了他個人的園藝盆裁。至少總說他有點自私。酸氣衝天的又吟出什麽「侯門一入深如海。從此蕭郎是陌人」的那種半失戀的旬子。然而你要想到不願意伊嫁人。却要伊永遠溷跡風塵中又没有拯拔伊的力量。只供係隨時可以買笑追歡。這樣何嘗不是自私。而這個自私。蹉跎伊們的一生。這罪惡其實還比較大。左詩晨那時的確滿希望蕊雲嫁一個對於伊忠實的好人。固問及幾時出院。阿金回答道。據典當裏的孫先生說。大概總在二十邊吧。這位章大少。並不在上海打小公館。伊是一直進大公館的。他們的大公館却是在蘇州。他們預備叫了一隻頭號官船。停泊在觀音閣碼頭。然後把阿囡用馬車來接了去。好像有些鄕下大人家做親。不是也把新娘子接在船上的嗎。然後他們用小輪船拖帶了。回到蘇州去。章大少還有老太太咧。當然要向老太太叩頭。又笑着說道。磕頭也不是白磕的。自然老太太也要拿出見面錢來。蕊雲道。我就不高興磕頭。我也不要什麽見面錢。左詩晨道。那倒不如此說。中國的禮法。對於尊長是應得磕頭的。别說你是去做小媳婦。便是大媳婦。也須和老太太磕頭的。左詩晨又問。那末就是伊一個人去。没有人陪伴伊去嗎。阿金道。這件事情還没有定。阿囡是要我倒也有點捨得給伊離開。我們三四節功夫常在一淘。没有一天離開。差不多睡也睡在一牀。說到那裏。阿金的喉嚨有點哽咽了。蕊雲的頭。也漸漸要俯到大菜盆子裏去。只怕這位向不肯示弱的小姑娘。眼圈兒也有些紅了。阿金繼續着說道。横豎我下節工夫。本來是白相一節。雖然大阿姨是極力的留我。但是阿囡不在那裏。我也不想在那裏了。我想章大少肯答應的。我就陪了阿囡到伊大公館裏去。大阿姨那邊倒也好說。又不要費伊什麽。但也至多陪伊一個禮拜。我也就要滾蛋的。我們堂子裏的人。到人家公館裏去。人家心裏總有點不高興。我是很知趣的</p>

<h3>三品狂跌與對華輸出</h3>
<p>日本三品紗自去年來漸趨跌勢、至最近一月間、跌風更猛、而逼近一百圓之關口、爲罕有之新低價、比去年最高價一月份之二百七十一元、相差已達一百七十元之譜、即就本年一月比較亦跌八十餘元、跌風之烈、殊爲驚駭、兹將本年六個月之市價表列後、（單位日元六月價至二十三日爲止）</p>

<p>查跌風之由來、（一）紗廠爲避免廢止夜工後生産之减少、而努力增錠、結果致生産達二十六萬包之空前紀錄、供求失其平衡、（二）濱口内閣實施金解禁、力行緊縮政策、引起財界不安定之狀態、内地消費因之減少、（三）印度年來爲日本棉製品之新市塲、詎自四月起增收棉布關稅百分之六並對於非英貨增收百分之五、致對印輸出呈停頓狀態（四）中國方面以銀價暴落、輸出激减、即南洋等處亦復不振、（五）美棉繼續下跌、步見新低價、凡此數種均予日本棉業界絶大打擊、紗市步趨下游、紡廠雖倡議减工、然終難挽此頽勢也、惟日紗跌勢一時似不易遏止蓋存紗三十萬包、存布五十萬包、而環境尚無轉機之象也、將來對於中國紗市、恐不免有相當之壓迫、即日紗對華輸出是、蓋紗市與匯市雖在同一線上、然紗跌匯縮未能成比例之進退、就目前三品紗價一百○二元五角合之匯市、不過華幣一百四十四兩、加之運費關稅亦僅一百六十五兩、較之上海二十支紗低約十兩左右、日紗運華之聲因之盛傳、標紗之趨跌、實有重大關係焉、據聞日商某洋行有向日本購買二十支日烏等紗運華銷售之說、果如所言、華紗恐又將受相當之壓迫矣、</p>
<h3>糧食粉市急轉直下</h3>
<p>洋麥報告頻現低峯…廠商暗中出檔</p>
<p>環境旣變勢難再抬…各月慘跌四分</p>
<p>昨日粉市各月份市面突呈慘落之象、查跌風之由來、半以洋麥報價步跌、開幾年來未見之低價、雖合劃未通、然市場人心不免受一部分之衝動、半以廠家主主面、已逐步暗中出檔、前之業外空頭、已變爲廠家之籌碼廠家之地位、但須小麥充分、而不慮交割之困難、業外浮多、到此地步、自不能無的放矢再行硬抬、環境旣變、而小麥究竟在旺令檔口、廠家不再擯持、趁勢壓小、結果本月份較前週跌三分二厘半、七·十月份各跌四分二厘半、八·九月份跌四分、十一月份跌三分七厘半云、</p>
<h3>近期麥暴跌錢六分</h3>
<p>現貨廠開一萬二千八百包</p>
<p>昨日各月份期麥市面、一致暴落不已、推原其故以洋麥報價愈小、又兼新麥已入旺令之時、大小廠家均欲趁此機會、大事購辦、所以在表面上均抱壓小之態、至空頭方面、除所有之浮空已經逐步抵回、目下之籌碼、似係備交割者、因此多頭人心、頓形皇恐、市面遂急轉直下、以暴跌聞矣、結果本月份較前週暴跌一錢六分之巨、七月份跌一錢三分、八月份至十一月份均跌九分、現麥因各廠均欲擯小、不願搶進、故各檔開價均小去五六分不等、開黃喬·沙市·姜堰·高郵·六合·竹鎭·昆山·浦東·儀徵·浦口等麥均屬高貨、中次廠家均無胃口、陳麥開五兩三錢半、共開一萬二千八百包、由阜豐一家辦去云、</p>
<h3>洋米銷旺市疲</h3>
<p>昨日洋米客化尚佳統市開出現貨一萬二千包、月底路貨七八千包由寗波温州本街内地各帮辦去寗波帮胃口更佳、除在市購買外、向行家直接批買者亦有三五千包此外尚有軍需去化、以客化而論市面本居穩勢、但因新到一批外、月底尚有十餘萬可到貨主均有脫意現貨之外、路貨亦在求脫、致市面反見疲軟矣、</p>
<h3>不下米市停頓</h3>
<p>社會局實行米船登記</p>
<p>閘北昨日粳市無交祗變元略有成交河斛一律停開、而到源有黃渡退回之中次貨船十餘號此間因社會局嚴限白粳不得過念一元而常帮米客、違限抬價、刻正追究、因此實行停交、現社會局决議將河下所有存到之米船一律登記凡河下斛貨時須將登記證隨帶、以便查騐、如無登記證者認爲私貨、從嚴罰辦、而凡登記米船、須在米行公會公開作價、此項手續刻已從速進行、大約今明日即可開斛矣、變元因在花色品中、故市上略有論價、趨勢甚緊、</p>
<p>滬南到船益少市中殊無若何交易、宛然停頓之象、所有極少數之零星中關粳、當由本街開去、價格步堅、洋米又報堅昂、因裏路客帮競進之影響也</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白升至八兩</h3>
<p>日車糖開六萬包</p>
<p>昨日公會粗砂曰市氣尚堅、少數買户略活、成交價爲八兩、後市出户扳住、後未有成交、市形平穩、中砂白俱鮮進出、高荷赤有索價七兩者、一時尚無受主、日糖明華廠開出七月份交貨車糖四萬包、計	ＹＲＯ嘜七兩九、ＹＴ嘜八兩二錢、ＹＰ嘜八兩四錢、又明治廠亦開出七八月份交貨額計二萬包、ＹＴ嘜六兩六錢加稅、划價八兩二錢、行方進胃頗濃、如數售通、頗覺俏秀云、</p>

<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、續呈提高抑低之象、婺源北鄕高莊珍眉、因製法精良、顔色光亮、歐銷獨暢貘杜德·保昌·福時·永興等行均有相當進胃、交易尚不寂寞、市盤亦均堅挺、惟屯溪·遂安·歙縣·温州土莊等路之中低莊茶、仍因摩洛哥市塲、存底豐厚、銷路依然呆滯、祁寗紅茶、市面逐漸衰落、大勢仍難認爲樂觀云、</p>
<h3>杭垣新夏繭到貨漸旺</h3>
<p>杭垣各市鄕、今歲夏蠶因受天寒雨多損害、大半發現白殭、繭産仍歉拱宸橋一帶繭行仍爲緯成虎林等絲廠續租、開秤後又值霪雨不止、三日中到貨寥寥、前日天已放晴、市上到繭雖轉旺、而各行放價競收、高貨價已開七十元、今歲繭質優劣懸殊、後市看漲次繭開五十四五元云、</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>前鋒周報創刊號秉衡</h3>
<p>前鋒社出版</p>
<p>開明·眞美善書店代售</p>
<p>關於文藝方面的書報、在目前以量的方面看來、似乎呈現了蓬勃的盛况、不過實際上你想要找幾本好的却也是不很容易的事、走進書店裏、紅的綠的封面、以及大廉價的幌子、到眞有些令人目眩五色、可是、你隨手到架廚上去取幾本書翻一翻他的内容、那你便可發見有許多作品簡直是千篇一律、只是「賣膏藥式」的十八句江湖口訣、販幾個外國名詞來模仿直抄而已、更有些所謂翻譯的、那眞是一本「天書」、任誰也不會看懂、當然無從了解、勉强翻上幾頁、便免不了要頭痛了、</p>
<p>因其如此丨花了錢還要頭痛丨我對於買書這一項便格外基酌起來、而「書報介紹」便成了我唯一的好友了、屢承他誠實地介紹許多有價值的書給我們、永不曾叫我們上過當、而且、更增加了我不少的讀書的興趣、</p>
<p>不過、在書報介紹方面却只見介紹過書、而報則似乎不見提起、在我看來、旣名書報介紹、當然「報」也是有介紹之必要的、於是、我便大着膽子來破題兒第一遭了、把我最近所看見的前鋒周報創刋號介紹給我們的讀者、</p>
<p>「前鋒週報」創刋號除發刋詞外、包含了兩篇論文、四篇小品、這兩篇論文、一篇是澤明的「中國文藝的没落、」一篇是雷盛的「民族主義的文藝」、四篇小品的作者是錦軒的、一、「魯迅先生的遠識」、二、「符咒與法師」、三、「生財有道錢杏邨」、四、「所謂主義的奴才」、</p>
<p>這裏面理論是很充實的、態度也很嚴肅、在「中國文藝的没落」中、作者不只是把「舊文藝的没落」與「新文藝的没落」很明白地告訴了我們、而且、還將新文藝没落的原因指示出來、他說、「因爲所謂文學革命只是文腔革命、因爲新文藝只是新腔調的舊文藝、所以新文藝一下子也就没落了、」這是事實、誰也應該承認的、</p>
<p>同時、作者却不讓我們文藝這樣没落下去、你看他說、</p>
<p>舊文藝没落了、新文藝也没落了、　　但是我們就讓中國文藝從此没落了嗎、</p>
<p>不能的、而且不可的、因爲文藝是一個民族的直化的最高的表現、靠了文藝的力量、可以作一個民族裏的全體民衆的生活向上而美化、靠了文藝的力量、可以使我們的精神提高而改善、靠了文藝的力量、可以使一個社會革新而進步…一個民族的文藝低落、就是一個民族的文化低落、文化低落的民族、從古迄今、只有被壓迫而永無享受安樂太平的生活的、所以我們對於我國的文藝、絶然不能任其没落的、也萬不可任其没落的、</p>
<p>本來、在我們中國文藝界、自從文學革命運動一直到現在、在這短短的十餘年間、正是和我國政局一樣的雜亂、在這雜亂的局面下、我們會看見殘餘的封建思想仍保持有很大的勢力、處處給新文藝一個莫大的障碍、而一般從事新文藝者、則又缺乏文藝的中心意識、往往隨着一已的興之所至、便標出些主義派别來、分立門户、各不相下、一般作家有的早晨尚在掄着兩把板斧把守藝術之宫、晚上便大喊其革命文學來、有的口口聲聲講趣味、而轉瞬間便喝一聲「突變」、而成爲普羅文學的領袖了、更有些是買乾魚放生、不知死活、同愛人唱玉堂春倒也罷了、却偏要嚷出「古典主義」來、此外、每個小組織、都擁着一個主觀的見解、什麽頽廢呀、唯美呀、傷感呀、等等等等、形形色色、便也層出不窮、於是、正如作者所說、「這都是意氣用事、一則忘却現在是怎樣一個時代、一則忘却了中國、並且忘却了自已是中國人、一則是排斥民衆、一則是逼迫民衆、所以兩者都不是民衆所能容忍的文藝、因之、兩者的提倡還没有得到相當的效果、都已自已定下了覆亡的命運、這眞是目前中國的一個大危機」我們再來看他提出的一條挽救中國文藝的途徑、</p>
<p>舊文藝没落的原因、我們已經看見了、就是在不顧民衆、新文藝没落的原因、我們也看見了、文藝的腔調比較接近民衆、但仍没有確立一個以民衆爲中心的主義、從這新舊没落的原因裏、我們可得到一個挽救我們文藝没落的方案了、靠了這位方案、並且還進而開拓我們文藝的運命、</p>
<p>最後、他便舉出這個方案來、丨</p>
<p>我們爲要挽救中國文藝、爲要開拓中國文藝的進路、我們大家要來一致提倡民族主義的文藝、</p>
<p>在對於文藝缺乏中心意識的我國文藝界、我們便不能不形成一個對於文藝的中心意識以突破這當前的危機、開拓中國文藝的進路、因此、作者提倡的民族主義的文藝便頗值得我們來研究的價值了、</p>
<p>雷盛的民族主義的文藝、便是專門討論這方面的文章、所以我們讀了前篇、這篇却非得讀他不可、</p>
<p>他首先說明民族主義與文藝的關係、和我國文藝不以民族爲中心的原因、接着便把民族主義文藝的特質很明白地說了出來、</p>
<p>他就歷史的事實老察、斷定文藝原來是民族的、而且、歐洲各國文的藝是靠民族主義而發展的、他說、</p>
<p>怎樣說文藝原來是民族的、</p>
<p>……在個人創作以前的文藝、都是民族的、像希臘的神話、英國的皮華甫、德國的尼貝龍歌、西班牙的西特以及我們的詩經、無一不是民族的産物、所以文藝原始形式我們現在雖難决定其爲如何、但是文藝原始狀能裏、不是從個人的文藝意識裏産生、而從民族的立塲所形成的生活意識裏産生的、却可斷言無疑、就文藝形能而言、原始的文藝、一是民族的叙事文藝、就是神話之類、一是民族的抒情文藝、就是民族的風謡之類、</p>
<p>文藝所以原來是民族的、</p>
<p>怎麽說歐洲各國的文藝都是靠了民族主義而發展的呢、</p>
<p>當中世紀時、歐洲只有混統的歐洲文藝、没有分别出某國某國的文藝、後來各國都應用起各自的國語來做學藝的用語、於是各國的文藝才告成立、而得各自發展、爲什各國要用各自的用語寫文藝呢、最重要的理由、就是因爲萌芽了民族主義的緣故啊、民族主義的運動、到近百數十年來、愈益强烈、民族主義的文藝也愈亦發達、</p>
<p>接着、他便舉出許多的例證來、如拿破崙侵俄、俄國大受損失、因之、俄國人才覺悟到民族主義的可貴、一時俄國人民便集中在發揚俄羅斯民族精神的努力上了、於是、便産生了俄國文學的一對父母、普希金和郭哥里、前者是以其夫才來表白俄羅斯的民意、後者是以俄羅斯民族固有的趣味與傾向作爲文藝的中心、因此俄羅斯的文學才得有今日的建樹、又如法國近來神秘詩人范來納到晚年終於要高唱「祖國的愛是第一」、其他如法國大小說家白萊史、也是竭力於民族主義宣揚的、這些事實都是以使我們相信歐洲各國文藝的發展可以說完全是靠民族主義的、而且更相信愈是弱小的民族、文藝以民族主義爲中心愈是明顯、</p>
<p>往下他便說明我們中國的文藝史中、充滿了官僚思想的文藝、和那些自鳴清高狂放頽廢的一派、和民族全没關係、所以中國個人創作的文藝從來没有一篇以民族爲中心的、而且、他並且「老實說」、這些不以民族做中心的文藝、在這要求民族自决的時代、給完全毁滅了、和我們民族全體的民衆、也没有什麽關係、</p>
<p>最後他便提出了民族主義的文藝的特質來、在我看、這是最需要注意的一點、他說丨丨</p>
<p>……民族主義文藝是有力的、有希望的、是有光明的、是有意志的、是有精神的、要喚起民族的意識、要激勵民族的生氣、團結起來、一致地爲民族而爭鬥、在這太陽似的民族主義以前、從來萎靡不振、淫亂頽廢、忸忸怩怩没有目的没有意志、只知做奴隸的文藝都要被摧毁、都要被消除、</p>
<p>……民族主義的文藝第二個特質、就是一把解剖刀、不是一根針、我們民族的善與惡、精神與物質、民族主義文藝都要剖解開來看一看、何以民族會腐化、民族的萎靡從何而起、中國的官僚何以會有只管自已不管民族的死活、像這樣的問題、如果是存在的話、不用隱匿、不用遮飾、民族主義文藝都要試一試剖解、</p>
<p>……是要不得的、歹的損害民族的、不論是屬於何一流人的行動、民族主義文藝都要加以意識的排擊、這又是民族主義文藝的一個特質、</p>
<p>民族主義文藝决不排斥外國的文藝、外國的文藝、倘是有益於民族的發展的、是要的要儘量吸收下來、吸收下來變爲我們民族自已的東西、……民族主藝文藝對於外國文藝、是選擇的介紹、不是肯目的介紹、是有意識的吸收、不是徒快一時的吸收、民族主義文藝是决不抛棄時代精神的、卻正要把握時代、而且要躍進於次一時代的、現在這時代是一個什麽時代、是强大的民族盡力用帝國主義壓迫弱小民族的時代、是弱小民族覺醒了一致起來要打倒帝國主義的時代、是弱小民族要求民族自决的時代、民族主義文藝正是要竭力發揚這種時代的精神、而且要表現次一時代、世界各民族一律平等時代的精神的、</p>
<p>總之、民族主義文藝是從民族的立塲、以發揚民族精神爲目的的文藝、是有希望的、有力的、解剖而至於批評的文藝、是把握時代精神的文藝在這裏、我們把民族主義的文藝有個相當的認識了、在這種中國文藝界混亂的局面下、我們便須以喚起民族意識爲中心、而集中我們此後的努力於民藝主義的文藝的創造、</p>
<p>至於四篇小品、見解非常銳利、觀察也很透澈、讀完了兩篇論文之後、再讀這四篇小品、眞是别有一番滋味呢、</p>

<h3>夏勞克的女兒</h3>
<p>雖則戲劇協社的威尼斯商人已經公演了一次、但是我、一個貧乏的中學生、因爲時間經濟地點的關係、没有機會去欣賞這樣的藝術、恰巧這次復演的時間、是在我們大考完畢了以後、於是去看了一次、對於佈景、除了過眞和堂皇以外、的確没有其他的話可說、劇中的人物、最能吸引我、最能使我對之表示同情的、却不是男主角白山奴、也不是女主角濮西亞、更不是奸惡的夏勞克、而是一個在劇中非常不重要的角色丨奸惡的猶太人夏勞克的女兒夏惜凱、</p>
<p>戲劇協社威尼斯商人中之顧秀中女士</p>
<p>她不幸生爲一個奸惡頑固的猶太人的女兒、她父親有着一般猶太人的特質、丨愛錢甚於愛至和遵守無理的舊禮敎丨所以她非常不自由、她深知父親重利盤剥的非法和殘忍、但又觀阻不住、於是毅然的不顧仇視異敎、異敎不通婚的猶太習俗、便背了她的父親和她的情人一同走了、全劇對於她的叙述祇有這一點、又和其她的人物没有多大關係、所以她是戲於非常不重要的地位、但是從這極短的述叙中、已足使我們充分的認識她、使我們佩服她目光的深遠和行爲的剛毅、</p>
<p>至少、在我想起來、她是現代中國一部份女子的典型、中國的女子、像她這樣的受到頑固的家庭和無理的禮敎的兩重壓迫的、正不知有多少、那末請放大你們的胆量、睜開你們的目光、努力的向前走吧、（毓楣）</p>

<h3>滬大童子軍赴日</h3>
<p>這是件多麽愉快而難得的機會喲、乘着目下火也似的長夏底餘暇、滬江大學的童子軍、就要在七月六日那天、到日本去、實地視察和遊歷異國的風味了、</p>
<p>講到日本、近在咫尺、而在風俗習慣文字種種方面、却同我們中國相去不遠、可是、她現在已經推爲亞東的强盛國家、所以我以爲若是要我們中國强盛起來的話、那日本的敎育政治經濟和其他一切構成强國强種的原動力底要素、實在比之歐美各國、還要值得我們的注意和多研究些、</p>
<p>滬大童子軍訓練的成績、雖然不敢說、在全中國各校之冠、然而此次赴日本的動因、是受着她們的迎請、而帶着代表全中國童子軍的色彩的、</p>
<p>這一次赴日的人數、一羣有四十一個人、領隊倪家璽君、現在學校雖然已經放了假了、然而這一班决定赴日的童子軍、在六月二十九日那天、還要冋到學校裏去、</p>

<p>伸展她的土地吐息於大海之上的地方以相等的愛憑倚於因幾許的記憶而呻鳴的地中海、</p>
<p>又於誰也没有渡越的大洋的無休止的潮的張了胸的西班牙、</p>
<p>丨丨佐治·愛略脫</p>
<p>在十七世紀褪了色的黃金時代以後、西班牙文學同意大利文學一樣、没有什麽確實性或獨創性、衰頽下去了、又同說到意大利的時候一樣、爲了研究或思索、不下獨斷的解答、我要提示出一國民的政治底及經濟底衰頽是否和那藝術底·那智底力的衰頽相伴這一個問題來、西班牙的帝位繼承戰爭在差不多瑞典及俄羅斯戰於東部歐羅巴的同時代、將英吉利·法蘭西·奥大利·普魯土·西班牙·荷蘭捲入於漩渦中、後來在同世紀末葉、法蘭西革命勃發、又將歐羅巴的大半引入於那漩渦中、没有一國是以平靜的心注意於精神的東西的、然而英吉利文學和法蘭西文學却由種種的方法顯示了繼續的活力、而在德意志的非普魯士底部分、也有新生活要産生、在别國則文學沈滯下去了、</p>

<p>那理由、或者一個理由是在那似乎有着極優秀的舞台上的姿相的西班牙人、縱有着種種的姿勢、却不過對於歐羅巴的其餘部分、對於囂俄、對於美里美、對於約翰、薩眞特對於文學底旅行者顯得那樣罷了、西班牙人在他的最優的書籍和他的繪畫之中、（我是冐了引起畫家和美術家的物議來的危險而這麽說的、）最眞切地觀照自已、因此當十九世紀中葉、西班牙文學抬起頭來、而在世界的文學中漸至佔着重要的地位時、新的人們就是對於那所描出的西班牙生活守着忠誠、而與其說是「羅曼底、」毋寗說是「寫實底一、然而不消說得、以那感情和寫法而言却普遍底地羅曼底的小說家及劇作家、倘若不然、世界决不會耳聞他們的罷、</p>

<h3>Collection of War Reports from Various Parties</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Officially announced, summarizing telegrams from various parties: (1) The enemy on the left wing of the Longhai Line, since being defeated by our army at Xiao, has been collapsing towards Chenliu and Kaifeng. Feng Yuxiang was alarmed and urgently dispatched Sun Lianzhong's, Zhang Ge's, Gao Shu's, and Shi You's divisions from the Pinghan Line, dividing them into separate routes to provide reinforcements, advancing towards Gaoxianji and Longxunji, hoping to attack our flanks. In order to eliminate the remaining rebels, our army launched a counterattack from Tongxu on the designated day, engaging in fierce fighting all day. The enemy then launched a counterattack on our side from the south of Gaoxianji. We immediately intercepted their waist with our main force, cutting off the head and tail of the enemy army, causing them to collapse. We are now pursuing them with our entire army. In this battle, we captured over a thousand enemy officers and soldiers, seized over two thousand rifles, six cannons, fourteen machine guns, and twenty-six submachine guns. According to the prisoners, the puppet division commanders Gao Shuxun and Ji Hongchang were both seriously injured, and there are rumors that they died en route due to their severe injuries. (2) The enemy, covered by artillery fire, launched an infantry attack on our Lujiazhuang position last night. Our army launched a head-on attack, killing many enemies and capturing over four hundred alive, seizing over five hundred rifles, six machine guns, eight mortars, and fifteen submachine guns. The remnants fled northwest. (3) The enemy on the Qingcheng front launched a full-scale attack on our position early in the morning. Our army was well-prepared and bombarded them with artillery fire, engaging in fierce fighting for three hours. The enemy failed, and our army waited for them to tire before launching a fierce attack, causing the enemy to collapse and retreat. In this battle, hundreds of enemy soldiers were captured, along with four mortars, six machine guns, and hundreds of rifles, and many were killed. (4) According to airplane reports, the enemy south of Guide Town and west of Feicheng has been moving their supply carts backward, appearing to be retreating. (5) This morning, about one brigade of the rebel army attacked our army from Luyi and was surrounded by us, killing two enemy battalion commanders and over two hundred soldiers, capturing over three hundred enemy soldiers, over five hundred firearms, dozens of horses, and a great deal of supplies. The situation is currently being resolved. (23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Telegram from Zhumadian on the 23rd: (1) The Northwest Army's Wei Fenglou, Sun Lianzhong, Zhang Zizhong, etc., having been defeated on the eastern route, are being transferred east and there are rumors of a concentration in Huangxian. It is said that Liu Zhi has advanced to the Lanfeng railway station. (2) Wei Fenglou's troops launched another fierce attack on Dashiqiao at dawn on the 22nd and were defeated by Xu Yuanquan's troops. In this battle, 2,000 enemy rifles were seized and five battalion commanders were captured alive. (3) Hao Mengling's troops encountered Ren and Liu's armies on the 20th and immediately made contact, capturing an enemy regimental commander alive and taking over a thousand officers and soldiers prisoner.

<p>National Government Issues</p>
<h3>Special Appointment Letter for Deputy Commander</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued a special appointment letter for the Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, which was handed over to the Northeast Provinces Liaison Office in Nanjing on the morning of the 23rd, sealed, and mailed to Shenyang. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Customs Incident</h3>
<p>Ge Jingyou Takes Over Tianjin Regular Customs</p>
<p>Consular Body Adopts Non-Interventionist Stance</p>
<p>National Government Temporarily Refrains from Expressing Opinion</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ge Jingyou, the superintendent of Tianjin Customs, took over the Regular Customs at 10:00 AM on the 23rd, following Yan Xishan's order, and salaries are scheduled to be paid on the 24th. Ge addressed the customs officials, promising to guarantee all preferential treatment and conditions. As for the Maritime Customs, Simpson paid salaries on the 23rd, but the number of former customs officials reporting for duty was four fewer than last Saturday, while the number of new customs officials is increasing daily. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin consular body held a meeting on the 23rd and decided to adopt a non-interventionist stance, and each telegraphed their ministers to report to their respective governments. Simpson told reporters that there are no more diplomatic problems, and the internal problems will be resolved in three to five days. The post office has 12,000 packages piled up, which were inspected and released on the 23rd. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The acting Norwegian minister, Habolas, arrived in Tianjin on the afternoon of the 23rd. Simpson requested the expulsion of the chief inspector, Omulans. Habolas said that Omulans had already gone south and would leave without being expelled. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Bei Le is scheduled to lead a team south by ship on the 25th after paying the salaries of the former customs officials. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is said that the Tianjin consular body believes that the Shanghai Customs' collection of import taxes on goods transported to Tianjin hinders international trade and will request the diplomatic corps to protest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Tianjin Customs incident, after our country sent a note to the British Minister, we have not yet received a response from the British side as of the afternoon of the 23rd. According to the foreign minister, the newspapers reported that various countries would implement tax collection on behalf of the Tianjin Customs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a formal report. If the reports are true, the government will certainly not allow it. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Tianjin Customs incident, according to a certain party, although the Tianjin consular body attempts to handle customs clearance affairs on behalf of the Tianjin Customs, the authorities here believe that the consular officials' authority cannot interfere in China's internal affairs, nor can they exercise the power to manage finances on behalf of the government. Moreover, various countries have recognized the National Government as the legitimate government of China, so how can they provide direct or indirect assistance to the rebels against the Chinese government, thereby hindering the Chinese government's authority over internal orders? This kind of bizarre approach will certainly not be adopted jointly in the international community. The Chinese and foreign customs officials of the Tianjin Customs originally held considerable positions and would certainly not support Simpson and exclude themselves from the Chinese government's preferential treatment unless they were subjected to violence and coercion, they would definitely resign unanimously. The eight customs offices designated to collect Tianjin Customs taxes on behalf of the customs office (Jianghai, Yuehai, Xiamen, Qingdao, Dalian, Andong, Qinhuangdao, and Yingkou) have successively telegraphed the Director-General of Customs to comply immediately. As for the Japanese warships sealing off Dagu Port and inspecting merchant ships entering the port, this measure will also be implemented. With such a widespread network, merchant ships will have no way to evade the imposition of Tianjin Customs taxes collected on their behalf. In the past week, it is said that the old taxes used to guarantee foreign debts of Tianjin Customs have still been remitted to the Shanghai HSBC Bank, while Yan Xishan wants to detain the portion of the new taxes used to guarantee domestic debts but cannot because Yan is currently relying on or coercing the Northern Consortium to help. Seizing them would only cause panic in the banking community. What he can obtain is only a limited customs surplus. Although this amount is formally deposited in the Tianjin Bank of Communications, it is withdrawn as soon as it is deposited, and the bank is unable to refuse. The Director-General of Customs, Maze, recently suggested to the Ministry of Finance that he wanted to keep customs taxes outside the political vortex. The central government believes that China's customs duties have always been unified and unaffected by politics. The responsibility for disrupting the customs system this time naturally rests with those who did it. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The foreign minister reported at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' memorial week this morning, "The most bizarre thing this week that deserves our attention is the forced takeover of the customs by the Englishman Simpson. This matter has been brewing for a long time. Given Yan's character, he is ambivalent and indecisive, yet he has taken this action, which is actually instigated by Simpson. Simpson's intention is to use the Tianjin Customs revenue to fund Yan's military expenses and sell his achievements. He does not know that after the National Government announced customs autonomy, this matter can be resolved using domestic political methods. Tianjin is already occupied by the rebels, so we have temporarily ordered the Tianjin Customs personnel to leave and have the nearby customs offices collect the goods taxes on behalf of them. However, Tianjin is still within Yan's territory, and merchants will inevitably be taxed twice when they pay taxes at nearby customs offices and then arrive in Tianjin. As a result, the Tianjin Customs is sealed off and commerce is stagnant. Simpson's actions are merely meddling in others' affairs. However, we still need to study this matter. Simpson, as a foreigner, openly helps the tyrant and opposes the National Government recognized by friendly countries, violating criminal law and bearing the responsibility. The National Government will have appropriate measures to deal with him in the future. It is not allowed by international law for foreigners to help rebels resist the government of the host country and infringe on the security of friendly countries. Judging from the spirit of the British government's founding and administration, I firmly believe that it will not allow Simpson to cause chaos, damage its virtues, and destroy the law. Therefore, we view it from a legal perspective, and Simpson will undoubtedly be sanctioned. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) I recently visited a certain member of the Political Council's Foreign Affairs Group and inquired about the government's stance on the Tianjin consular body's plan to handle customs tax collection on behalf of the customs office. The answer was that the UK and Japan are the strongest proponents of this matter, while the United States and France have not yet agreed. Currently, each country is seeking instructions from its respective government. Our government is studying ways to deal with this matter. If the consular body rashly implements this plan, there will be a clear expression. As for the Foreign Affairs Group, members such as Hu Hanmin, Tan Yankai, Wang Chonghui, and Wang Zhengting, etc., once studied this matter last Saturday, but there was no formal meeting. Everyone believed that the government should not express its opinions first, as various countries had not yet clearly expressed their attitude toward the Tianjin consular body's handling of tax revenue. It is necessary to wait for the attitudes of the countries to become clear before discussing countermeasures. Now, what we hope for from the British minister is that he can implement our country's proposal to expel the rebel-supporting Simpson from the country and impose appropriate punishment. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) British Consul-General in Tianjin, Carris, came to Beiping to see Minister Blue, reporting on various situations arising from the Tianjin Customs takeover, as well as Simpson's actions and Bei Le's statements, compiled into a small booklet. Blue did not express any solutions, only saying that Director-General of Customs Maze should handle the aftermath. Also, Simpson sent a certain American woman to handle the Tanggu sub-bureau, and regarding the opening of customs, hanging lights and flags, etc., they did not follow the usual practice. Therefore, British and Japanese merchants still handed over the taxes to the consulates for transfer to the Chinese Customs. Carris also made some statements to the Japanese embassy. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Dutch Minister Ouds told me that the term "Consular Corps" is inaccurate for the meeting of the consuls of countries related to the Tianjin Customs issue because the consuls in Tianjin who do not have concessions or customs affairs did not all participate. The meeting should be called the meeting of the consuls of countries related to the Tianjin Customs issue. Also, the consuls of countries related to Tianjin Customs requested Simpson to find a proper solution to Maze's statement regarding the collection of Tianjin Customs taxes on behalf of the customs by the customs of Shanghai, Jiaoao, and Lianyun, and the Shanghai Customs' first collection of import taxes on goods transported to Tianjin, in order to avoid double taxation for foreign merchants. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Simpson of Tianjin Customs sent the Russian Rookman-Lauff as the chief patrol of the Shipping Bureau and twelve new officials. As for the old seal, it has been found. The Dagu Port branch office does not recognize the new seal issue, and now the old seal is being reprinted. Regarding the issue of closing the Qinhuangdao branch office, Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Bei Le to open the customs as usual, still under the charge of the Deputy Customs Commissioner, the Englishman An Nei, etc. Bei Le requested instructions from the Director-General of Customs for a further decision. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the American embassy received notifications from the UK and Japan regarding the Tianjin Customs issue, the embassy requested instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which replied that the United States only asks about the convenience of overseas merchants. It is not necessary to ask about how taxes are collected or who is sent to collect them. Attention should be paid to whether the collection procedures are complete. If the previous method is followed, taxes can also be paid locally, without being deposited by the consulate to save procedures. In short, American merchants should not suffer time and economic losses due to the Chinese customs dispute. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is said that the consular body continued to hold a meeting this morning and resolved to submit a request to the embassy of each country to recognize the takeover of the customs as a fait accompli. The Tianjin Customs office seemed very busy today, but because many of them are novices, the procedures are inevitably chaotic. Simpson said that the difficult part is over and that capable personnel will be available for command within a week. There are some former customs officials of German nationality, who were previously dismissed for political reasons, who are said to be joining the force with generous salaries. As for the customs officials under Bei Le, except for some Chinese brokers, all the others have followed the instructions of the Director-General of Customs and have not yet reported for duty. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>A Certain Important Person Says</p>
<h3>Northeast Decides to Send Troops</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person in the Northeast military said that since Zhang Xueliang took charge of the Northeast, the area of Linhuyu inside Shanhaiguan has been garrisoned by two brigades of Yu Xuezhong's troops. Later, when Yan and Feng's rebellion was revealed, Yu Xuezhong was appointed as the commander of the Linyu Garrison, and two more brigades were added to the troops entering the pass, garrisoned between the river and Tangshan, with a total strength of twelve regiments. When the Northwest implemented the rebellion, it coincided with the tense Sino-Russian diplomacy. Zhang was afraid of being involved in the war, which would cause further disadvantages to diplomacy, so he consulted with Commander-in-Chief Chiang. The Northeast must make every effort to deal with foreign affairs and temporarily provide material assistance for the suppression of the Northwest. After Mo Dehui and his party arrived in Moscow, the formal Sino-Russian talks stalled. Therefore, it was decided to send troops first, eliminate Yan and Feng, and unify China before facing foreign affairs as a whole. It was decided at the Supreme Military Conference of the Northeast. Yan and Feng dared not neglect the rear of Tianjin and Tanggu, and they did not dare to formally garrison troops along the Beining Railway, but they did send secret agents to secretly reconnaissance along the Beining Railway. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese and Turkish Representatives Continue Talks on New Treaty</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Turkish Acting Minister Fouad Bey arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 23rd. At 3 PM, he continued talks on the Sino-Turkish Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese side was represented by Li Jinlun, Hu Shize, Liu Shishun, and Tan Shaohua, while the Turkish side was represented by Fouad Bey. After the meeting, the agreed-upon articles were reread, and both sides had no objections. Then, the unresolved points were discussed. As a result, the Turkish side has agreed to the issue of establishing consulates. The issues of overseas Chinese and tariffs remain unresolved. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM and is scheduled to continue tomorrow afternoon. If all the unresolved points can be completely resolved, the talks can be concluded within this week.

<p>An ancient saying goes, "Only when clothing and food are sufficient can people know honor and shame." All human beings are not very different. People only know that rich and powerful countries have orderly order, no internal unrest, and no fierce political disputes, thinking that the people of their countries all take the overall situation into account, but they do not know that this is all due to the economic prosperity of the people, with all industries flourishing, each with a livelihood, and the national government's finances are abundant and can cope smoothly. Even if there are one or two disagreements, things can generally be done right. If, suddenly, the national economy is impoverished and a large number of people find it difficult to make a living, then the security of the country will inevitably be affected. If, suddenly, the finances of the country are in trouble and there is not enough resources, then the political response will definitely not be smooth, and political disputes will inevitably become fierce as a result. What is called orderly order will inevitably be shaken. This is not an exaggeration on my part. It is based on the common sense of human nature and cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly said this during the European War. People's actions are not very different in times of life-and-death crisis. All methods are used to strengthen one's own power and frustrate the enemy's prestige. The methods of propaganda, the rhetoric of concealment, the state of seeking help from others, and the world and other human beings are all the same. Once the war is over and the crisis has passed, the appearance of arrogance returns to its former state. Now that the world's war has passed and the world's economic panic has arisen. If this continues for a long time, then the so-called rich and powerful nations of the world may one day have internal struggles, internal unrest, and an inability to maintain internal security, perhaps even more than the non-rich and powerful nations of today. This is because we know that human beings are not very different in times of extreme poverty.</p>

Moreover, those who support the organization of the government are not talented. If they are not recruited, they will be disappointed and cause trouble. If they are recruited, serious talent will not come. Wouldn't this hinder the path of the virtuous? The reason why I have always strongly rejected public opinion is this. I hope Wang Jingwei will come north and resolve Party affairs first, before we can talk about the government." (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Toxic Substances Shipped to the Far East</h3>
<p>Worth 30,000 Pounds Sterling</p>
<p>Customs Officials in Marseilles Seize on Italian Ship</p>
<p>Reuter, Paris, 23rd Customs officials in Marseilles searched and seized one ton of narcotics worth 30,000 pounds sterling. The drugs were hidden in boxes and brought to Marseilles on an Italian ship from Turkey, for transshipment to the Far East. Paris had received a report beforehand stating that an international organization was shipping large quantities of heroin and morphine from Turkey to Marseilles, and then from Marseilles to Saigon and Shanghai.

After 400 pounds of cocaine were seized from a certain ship in Bordeaux, inspectors today seized more than 1,100 pounds of morphine, heroin, and cocaine from a British ship and an Italian ship that arrived here from Constantine, all destined for South Africa, China, and South Vietnam.</p>

<h3>New US Tariff Implemented</h3>
<p>Will Not Affect Trade</p>
<p>Secretary of Commerce Claims</p>
<p>Nearly 400,000 Unemployed in New York</p>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 22nd The Secretary of Commerce stated here today that the surprising development of American foreign trade will not be hindered by the tariff case. When the tariff was changed in 1922, foreign countries protested, just as they do today. However, in the seven years since the last tariff was implemented, American exports have increased by 41 percent, and imports of European manufactured goods have also increased by 45 percent. In 1929, of the major commercial countries, only the UK imported less goods into the US than in 1922. This is unrelated to changes in the American tariff. Exports of American manufactured goods have almost doubled annually in the past seven years.</p>

<h3>Our Representative at Geneva</h3>
<p>Describes Labor Management Situation</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 23rd The Chinese representative, Zhu Maocheng, spoke at the International Labor Conference on the 20th of this month, detailing the active cooperation between China and the International Labor Office, stating that China has sent representatives to three consecutive labor conferences and has recognized the Minimum Wage Convention. A special communication mechanism has also been established in China to communicate with Geneva. Mr. Mi then went on to state that the Chinese government has spared no effort in striving for reform and progress in labor management, such as the promulgation of labor laws and the protection of female and child labor. In addition, it has strived to improve the status of labor. The Chinese working class accounts for the majority, so the Chinese government is very willing to occupy a seat on the management team of the International Labor Office in Geneva. He further pleaded for the revision of Article 393 of the Peace Treaty, increasing the number of management team members from twenty-four to thirty-two, which is also an urgent task that should be implemented today. It is heard that when the report submitted by the board of directors was discussed by the conference, it was chaired by Mr. Zhu.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Demands Economy</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Attitude Still Tough</h3>
<p>New Budget Difficult to Compile</p>
<p>Telecommunications, Tokyo, 23rd Two weeks have passed since the Ministry of the Army and the Ministry of the Navy responded to the Ministry of Finance's demand for economy, but there has been no response whatsoever. Other ministries have recognized that economy is unavoidable and are quite close to the Ministry of Finance's request. However, the attitude of the Army and Navy is quite tough. Regarding the Ministry of Finance's estimated savings of 45 million yen in military spending, the Army can only save 5 million yen, and the Navy 3.5 million yen, totaling 8.5 million yen. Internal negotiations with the Ministry of Finance are continuing. The Ministry of Finance plans to continue negotiating, requesting the Army and Navy to make concessions. If unsuccessful, the Ministry of Finance's plan to save 80 million yen in the overall budget can only save half, and a major flaw will inevitably occur in the financial plan, hindering the compilation of the next fiscal year's budget.</p>

<h3>Lunar Travel</h3>
<p>French Scientist Says Realization Is Possible</p>
<p>German Professor Engaged in Preliminary Experiments</p>
<p>Telecommunications, Berlin, Traveling to the world of the moon seems to be a dream at present, but the French scientist Bertheliot said, "After ten or fifteen years, traveling back and forth to the moon will almost certainly be possible, and is definitely not a dream, but only a matter of money and experimentation." Sharing the same view with Bertheliot is Professor Koppiers of Germany. The first step of his experiment is near Hehrting on the Baltic coast. The professor is using something he made like a rocket to shoot into the world of the moon. Although it has not yet reached the lunar world, it is believed to have reached a height of 50 kilometers. With more experiments, it will surely be able to reach the moon. The rocket used in the experiment is in the shape of a two-meter-one-five oxygen container, covered with "Magnesium", which can withstand drastic temperature changes. The advance of the rocket can be seen because "Magnesium" ignites. The inside of the rocket is filled with hydrogen gas invented by Professor Koppiers. The rocket advances as it explodes, and when it is no longer able to advance and falls, a safety umbrella opens by itself.</p>

<h3>Memorial Week of the Central Government and National Government</h3>
<p>Simultaneous Central Government Commemorates the Shakjoi Massacre</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 23rd, the Central Party Headquarters held the fifth-anniversary commemoration of the Shakjoi Massacre in the main auditorium, simultaneously holding the 65th weekly memorial service for the late Premier. Attendees included Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Dai Chuanxian, Wang Chonghui, Liu Luyin, Chen Lifu, Shao Yuanchong, Wang Boqun, Enke Batu, Chen Zhaoying, Jiao Yitang, Kexinge, and the National Government legal advisor, American Mr. Lin Baek, as well as representatives from various government agencies and staff members from the Central Party Headquarters, totaling approximately six to seven hundred people. Hu Hanmin presided over the ceremony, and after the formal greetings, the chairman delivered a speech, stating that five years ago on this day, the people of Guangzhou, fueled by righteous indignation due to the May Thirtieth Massacre in Shanghai, and wanting to aid the negotiations related to the massacre and continue the spirit of the martyred heroes, held a meeting in the morning and a parade in the afternoon. This was a rightful expression of the people and was in no way a provocative action. However, the British warship at Shameen opened fire on the crowd, causing numerous deaths and injuries to Chinese merchants and civilians, reaching the height of cruelty. The British Consulate in Shameen, being the longest-stationed in China, was well aware that the Qing government and Northern warlords were adept at colluding with imperialists to oppress their own people. Consequently, they held the Chinese nation and the spirit of the people in utter contempt, engaging in slaughter and abuse as they pleased, using violent and tyrannical methods against the Chinese people that they could not employ in their own country or colonies. The main reason for this was the constraints of the unequal treaties. It is clear that unless the unequal treaties are abolished, the Chinese nation has no hope of escaping suffering. However, this also fosters the sin of contempt for humanity in that country, leading to the infamous destruction of international law and morality. Currently, the Englishman H.O.K. Simpson is openly assisting Chinese rebels and disrupting the customs system, relying on unequal treaties as a protective talisman and taking imperialism as his starting point, which can be said to remain unchanged throughout. However, since Britain has recognized the National Government, it should sanction Simpson's illegal actions in China. The reason Simpson declared is that he was appointed by Yan Xishan, but even if Yan appointed him, he should not absolutely obey. By accepting a false appointment, he is no different from aiding Yan's rebellion. It is hoped that the British authorities will pay attention and not allow him to entrench himself and collude. Next, Mr. Lin Baek was introduced to give a speech, which was translated by Zhang Guowei, a counselor of the Judicial Yuan. Lin's speech mainly stated that Nanjing is the holy land where the Premier's mausoleum is located, but it is not just the Premier's personal holy land; in the future, it can become the holy land of the world because the Premier is believed in by the world, and his Principle of People's Livelihood is truly the greatest doctrine in the world in two thousand years. Although foreigners are not familiar with Chinese characters, many are willing to fully study the content of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and the United States expresses particular sympathy. Currently, the world has three major countries with different doctrines: the United States is a capitalist country, China is a country of the Three Principles of the People, and Russia is a country of false communism. The final trend must be assimilation by the Three Principles of the People. I was originally a judge in the United States, and the reason why I participated in the Chinese revolution and followed the Premier through hardships, remaining consistent throughout, is because I admire the greatness of the Premier's personality and doctrine, which can not only save China but also save the world. The greatest spirit of the revolution is (1) loyalty and (2) obedience. I have truly abided by it. Although Chinese politics is currently in a transitional period, I believe that it will soon reach the other shore. Although there are the rebellions of Yan and Feng and Simpson's recent disruptions at the Tianjin Customs, they will never hinder the progress of China's construction and the consolidation of the National Government's position. Furthermore, I believe that the spirit of cooperation between China and the United States will definitely become more and more consolidated. After the report, the meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. ▲On the same morning at 10:00 AM, the National Government held the weekly memorial service for the late Premier. Attendees included Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Ma Fuxiang, Wang Zhengting, Jiang Menglin, Zhang Nanxian, Lin Xiang, Chen Yu, Zhang Wohua, and over three hundred staff members from the Secretariat and the Military Council. Tan Yankai presided over the ceremony, and after the formal greetings, Secretary Qian Changzhao gave the following report: "The military operations are proceeding very smoothly. On the Pinghan and Longhai Railways, the rebels Ji Hongchang, etc., were killed, and Sun Liangcheng, etc., were seriously injured. The rebel forces on the Jinpu Railway also suffered many casualties, and the entire line will definitely collapse within days. In Hunan, the rebel Zhang Gui is fleeing south, and Bai Chongxi, etc., have been injured. They are currently being surrounded by our forces on all sides and will be eliminated imminently. In general, the military operations will soon be concluded. Originally, the central military victory was not a problem. What needs to be considered and should be prepared quickly is how to restore social vitality and put politics on track after the military operations are over. Years of domestic warfare have depleted social vitality. During the military period, people directly and indirectly sacrificed for the revolution, which is unavoidable. Once the military operations are over, they must live and work in peace, and vitality will slowly recover. However, recently, bandits are rampant everywhere. No matter which province, there are almost daily bandit alarms. After the military operations are over, even if the bandits slightly restrain themselves, it will not be easy to eliminate them completely. It will require a thorough suppression to solve the problem completely. In short, unless the bandit scourge is eliminated, the people will never be able to live and work in peace, and social vitality will be difficult to restore. As for the army itself, the implementation of reorganization and disbandment is also an urgent task after the military operations are over. Now that the obstacles to this reorganization and disbandment, such as Yan and Feng, have been removed, progress will naturally be smooth. Speaking of politics, when we read Chinese and foreign history, whenever a country progresses from a state where politics is not fully on track to one where politics is clear and bright, it is often after a major event. Because after a major event, the central government gains victory, and its prestige is established. As long as the authorities have the determination to organize the country, it will definitely be twice the result with half the effort. This large-scale rebellion by the reactionaries has been quelled by the central government, which can be said to be a very important key to our country and also the best opportunity for our country to put politics on track. I believe that there are three points that should be particularly emphasized. The first point concerns the problem of people: to eliminate corrupt elements. The so-called corrupt elements include all kinds of foul people. If these corrupt elements are not eliminated, there will never be a day when politics is clear and bright. However, their influence in society is not small. We must have the full determination to break through the constraints of relationships and do it boldly. At the same time, I also hope that everyone will pay attention to psychological construction to create a good atmosphere, so that foul people will gradually know how to correct their mistakes and start anew, and that comrades whose determination is not very firm will not be carried away by the evil tide. The second point concerns the problem of law: to promote the spirit of the rule of law, so that the people respect and abide by the law, from top to bottom. To achieve this goal, first, the legislation must be good and suitable for the environment; second, the people must have a common knowledge of the law. Currently, the Legislative Yuan is working very hard on the legislative aspect and can be expected to improve day by day, but the people's common knowledge of the law is too lacking and must be remedied. The third point is to cultivate fair and powerful public opinion. Recently, in our country's society, there is almost no right or wrong, which is because there is no fair and powerful public opinion. Often, people with bankrupt personalities have positions in society, while fair people are ostracized and become passive. In addition, our country's society is most forgetful. Some people, whose misdeeds are obvious for a time and are rejected by society, after a certain period of time, even if they have not reformed themselves, as long as they are good at scheming, society will soon forget their past crimes and still accept them. This phenomenon is really not good. Therefore, society should cultivate fair and powerful public opinion to correct the behavior of the general public, and the government should do its best to support it. The above three points may be what everyone thinks of. I have repeatedly mentioned them, just to arouse the determination of the people to do what they say and put politics on track."</p>
<h3>The Situation in Guangxi After the Death of Lu Huanyan</h3>
<p>Yu Quanshoulders Military and Civil Administration</p>
<p>Wu Fan is Appointed to Take Over Lu's Troops</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The assassination of Lu Huanyan, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, in Guangdong has been detailed in previous reports. It has been verified that after Mr. Lu shot himself at the New Asia Hotel that night, he was immediately sent to the Zhongda Medical College on Baizi Road in Dongshan. The Eighth Route Army Headquarters issued a funeral fund of 5,000 yuan and organized the Lu Funeral Office, with Yang Dingzhong in charge. At the same time, military and police agencies increased the number of detectives to urgently track down the masterminds and main persons involved in the assassination of Lu. As for the assassin, Feng Mingsheng, he is still being held in custody awaiting interrogation. He will be dealt with after the entire case has been investigated. The death of Mr. Lu has attracted considerable attention from those concerned about the political situation in Guangxi. This is because Lu has recently held the great power of both military and civil administration. He still wears the title of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Route Army, and is also the Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government. Therefore, in recent years, Guangxi has undergone a series of changes, and Mr. Lu's actions have been taken seriously by both sides. Until recently, when the military operations in Guangxi ended, Lu came to Guangdong from Wuzhou to discuss with the two Chens in Guangdong the overall plan for the aftermath of the situation in Guangxi. Unexpectedly, he was murdered, which seems to have some impact on the future of cleaning up the situation in Guangxi on the surface. However, after careful examination of the actual situation in Guangxi, it is still extremely complex. Lu's troops in Guangxi consist of approximately one division, namely the two brigades of Gong Shouyi and Li Deying, stationed between Guixian, Hengxian, and Yulin. In addition, there is Lu Chunguan's garrison team in Yulin Prefecture. The above-mentioned units are Lu's basic army in Guangxi. The rest, the newly formed division of Zhu Weizhen, has always been directly under the Eighth Route Army Headquarters. Between Liuzhou and Qingyuan, there are also various miscellaneous troops under Huang Shaoxiong, such as Wei Yunsong, Han Caifeng, and Lu Fuxiang. Although they resist and defy obedience, they are mostly a rabble and are more than enough to be a local problem, but not enough to accomplish anything. As for the main force in Guangxi now, it seems to still belong to the 59th Division of the Eighth Route Army, led by Yu Hanmou. Therefore, after Lu Huanyan's death, before Chen Jitang left to enter Hunan, he had appointed Mr. Yu to act as the military officer, taking the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Route Army, commanding the various armies in Guangxi. Of course, the remaining troops of Lu also fall under the command of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters. As for taking over Lu's troops, Lu's Chief of Staff Wu Fan has now been sent back to Guangxi to handle it. Regarding the civil administration in Guangxi, there have been rumors about the organization of the Guangxi Provincial Government. Mr. Lu's trip to Guangdong this time was to discuss important policies, and the organization of the Guangxi Provincial Government was also one of the matters under discussion. Now that Lu has suddenly been killed, how to deal with the future civil administration in Guangxi has also become a problem. According to official news, the current civil administration in Guangxi is temporarily handled by the Chief Political Training Officer of the Eighth Route Army. Therefore, Yu Han and Chief Ou of the Chief Political Training Officer of the Eighth Route Army set off for Hekou on the 17th by the Guangzhou-Sanshui train, then transferred by boat to Wuzhou, to preside over the military and civil administration in Guangxi, along with Zeng Rubo, a member of the Guangxi Party Affairs Reorganization Committee.

<h3>The Decline of the Jiangxi Currency Circulation Note</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence on the 19th: The local budget for Jiangxi's annual income and expenditure is more than 14 million yuan. Recently, due to the scarcity of rice and the prevalence of bandits and communists, the monthly income is less than 100,000 yuan (only a dozen counties have funds to remit), while the monthly necessary expenses for bandit suppression and administration are about 600,000 yuan, which is a huge difference between income and expenditure. Chen Jiadong, the Director of Finance, issued 1.2 million yuan of currency circulation notes due to arrears in administrative expenses for more than two months, from April of this year to March of next year, with 100,000 yuan redeemable monthly. After the issuance, it was quite convenient to use in the market. However, recently, affected by the current situation, unscrupulous merchants and city councils have manipulated it extensively. Before the tenth day of this month, each yuan could still be used at 80% to 90% of its value. However, various merchants had already secretly raised prices by 30% to 40%, causing a great blow to the livelihood of ordinary people. It became more and more serious. Recently, the various money houses in this city suddenly refused to accept the currency circulation notes, making them unsalable. All industries originally depended on money shops for transfers. Since the money merchants did not use them, from the 15th, various merchants refused to accept currency circulation notes for purchasing goods, and those who accepted them did not give change. In the past two days, this note has completely stopped being used (some people are still secretly buying it at 60% of its value). The market has suddenly presented a bleak scene, and a group of poor people and staff members of various government agencies are all complaining. Even the kitchens of various government agencies have mostly closed down and stopped providing meals. Regarding the relief of this note, the provincial government specially convened a meeting of the financial community yesterday, instructing them to find ways to maintain it. The Department of Finance also plans to raise funds to redeem this note in advance. The business community also plans to raise funds to buy currency circulation notes, but practical measures have not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Organ Broken Up in Zhangzhou</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Communist Party in Zhangzhou has been extremely active recently. The Bandit Suppression Headquarters has captured and executed several people who cut off power lines, and learned that the Communist Party had an agency in Zhangzhou to direct and instruct them. Therefore, it ordered the police to conduct a thorough investigation. One night, a night watchman from the Public Security Bureau passed through a small alley in the market, and suddenly a package of paper fell from above. He picked it up and saw that it was a Communist Party leaflet. The matter was reported to the Public Security Bureau, which immediately sent detectives to secretly investigate the nearby area. They discovered that the Dongchang store, opposite the Shixing Automobile Company on Dingwei South Road, had people resembling students entering and leaving every night. The store owner, Zhan Chungkui, was from Raoping, Guangdong. He was originally in Dongzhakou and moved here three months ago. Several fellow villagers, such as Zhan Naicang, were lodging in the store. After further investigation, it was learned that Zhan and others were the organizers of the Communist Party in Zhangzhou, but their whereabouts were extremely secret, and they were rarely seen gathering together. Therefore, a plan was devised to capture them all in one fell swoop. Zhan and others also thought that the martial law in Zhangzhou had been extremely tight recently, and they were eager to avoid it. They planned to return to Raoping in Guangdong via a sailing boat via Pinghe. However, the military police along the way were checking very strictly, so they tried to ask someone to apply to a division headquarters for passports in the name of students. The division headquarters had long known the truth, so it deliberately gave the passports, hoping to capture them all when they left. At the same time, it notified the Zhangma Public Security Bureau to send the security team led by Deputy Squad Leader Tang and the investigation team leader Zhang Bingzhen at 8:00 PM on the 17th to lay an ambush in four places. The old bridge boat bottom and the vicinity of the Dongchang store of the automobile company were densely packed with detectives. At dawn on the 18th, Zhan and three others went to the old bridge to take a boat. Plainclothes detectives followed them closely. After disembarking, the three were captured. One was Zhan Naicang, who had studied at Zhangzhou No. 3 High School; one was Zhan Hua; and one was Zhan Jicai. The former had also studied at a certain school in Zhangzhou. Now they are all out of school. They are all about twenty years old and are engaged in important work of the Communist Party. In addition, there was a Mr. Cai from Pinghe who also participated in important work. He was originally scheduled to travel with them, but he escaped after hearing the news. His luggage was entrusted to Yang Hualong, a student of Chongzheng School, to carry it on the boat first. Because of this, Yang was also arrested. At the same time, Deputy Squad Leader Tang disguised himself as a civilian and went to the Dongchang store to shop. He saw the store owner Zhan Chungkui reading farewell letters from Jicai and others in the counter, which roughly said that the atmosphere in Zhangzhou has been tense recently, and for safety reasons, they had to return to their hometown temporarily. Tang immediately went out and called the ambushing police officers into the store. They first arrested Zhan Chungkui, then searched the store. As a result, a large number of Communist Party books and correspondence were found in the back room upstairs. They were immediately sent to the Public Security Bureau, and the store was sealed. The four people, including Zhan, have now been transferred from the Public Security Bureau to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters for interrogation. As for Yang Hualong, the principal of Chongzheng School proved that the student always followed school rules and had no untoward actions. This time, Cai's luggage was entrusted to him to carry it to the boat due to his fellow villager relationship, and he was unaware of the situation. He has been allowed to be released on bail by the school. (20th)</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan Returns to Shenyang to Report on the Shaanxi Disaster</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Liaoning Joint Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association held a plenary committee meeting at the YMCA at 5:00 PM on the 16th to welcome Mr. Zhu Qinglan, who is enthusiastic about disaster relief (according to reports, Mr. Zhu returned to Shenyang from Tianjin yesterday). First, Chen Wenxue, the Director of Civil Affairs, reported on the establishment of the disaster relief association and the results of fundraising. Then, Mr. Zhu reported on the situation of the Shaanxi disaster, stating that after I arrived in Ping, I saw reports that the Liaoning Joint Community had launched a Shaanxi disaster relief effort, which showed enthusiasm, and even more proved that the psychology of social sympathy had moved, which was very gratifying. I have returned this time, first to thank all sectors for their enthusiasm and perseverance, and second, to report to everyone on the disaster situation in Shaanxi. I will first review the past disaster relief process with you, so as to make it clear. Disaster relief in Northeast China began in 1926, but at that time it was only limited to within the Yuguan Pass, that is, the local area of Shandong. By 1927, the disaster area had expanded, and Zhili and Henan were also affected. The disaster relief in 1926 involved purchasing grain from Jiangsu Province and passing through the Taonan, Angangxi, Hailar, Sino-Eastern, South Manchuria, North Ning, and other routes, negotiating for exemption from transportation costs, which involved many twists and turns. By 1928, the Datong Road was completed, and the relief grain was directly transported from Jiangsu Province through the North Ning Road. In 1929, because the grain in Jiangsu Province was expensive, and the Russian Incident occurred, and there were also floods, it was changed to purchasing grain from Xinmin, Jinzhou, Beipiao, and Suizhong, but only transporting it to Fengtai. In 1928, Commander-in-Chief Zhang made a great wish for the disaster relief in Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, and agreed to donate 300,000 silver dollars. In the winter of that year, Finance Minister Song Ziwen and Railway Minister Sun Ke immediately requested the Commander-in-Chief to allocate the funds based on the previous reports. This 300,000 yuan of disaster relief funds was distributed equally among the disaster-stricken areas, with 45,000 yuan per area. This is the history of disaster relief in Northeast China. However, transportation along the way is the most difficult. All transportation railways talk about income and cannot always fulfill their obligations, which is a fact and cannot be helped. Qinglan had never met Yan Xishan before, and he did not even know Feng Yuxiang. This time, he went to Taiyuan to meet with Yan to transport relief grain, asking him to allocate a train for disaster relief. Fortunately, Mr. Yan agreed, assigned someone to be responsible, and also telegraphed Feng Huanzhang to start negotiating for vehicles. It was stipulated that the grain train would go straight to the Longhai Road and arrive at Baoling. No matter what kind of vehicle, it was not allowed to drive ahead of the grain train. Therefore, 1.5 million yuan of grain train could travel unimpeded. However, when the relief grain arrived at Baoling, it was the end of the railway, and it was even more difficult to transport it to Shaanxi. To cross the Yellow River, you must wait for the east wind. It can take five or six days to reach Xi'an if the wind is favorable, otherwise it may take thirty or forty days. Due to this difficulty, heavy-duty vehicles were used for transportation. There were limited official transport vehicles, and the freight for commercial transport vehicles was at least six yuan per bag of grain. Upon arrival in Xi'an, small carts were needed to distribute it to the disaster areas. If it was not distributed, the disaster victims, after starvation, could not bear the hardship of traveling back and forth. In fact, no one would come to pick it up, and they would have to wait for death. Therefore, the transportation cost of the small carts also consumed more than 20,000 yuan. Now, both donating money and grain are needed. Although it is difficult to transport grain, if money is given to the disaster victims, the local grain prices can also be maintained. The first time Qinglan went to Shaanxi, he only went to Xi'an Provincial City to discuss disaster relief with various charitable organizations. He was still unaware of the situation of the disaster victims, so he went to Shaanxi a second time. This trip was quite dangerous. When escorting the grain train, from the north of the Yellow River, passing through Henan, the Yellow River Railway Bridge was a protected bridge and was not allowed for large train heads to pass. After crossing the river, passing through the mountains in Henan, the terrain was steep. If there was no large train head, it would sometimes return halfway up the mountain. It was extremely dangerous to be able to retreat twenty or thirty miles. Passing through Xianyang, Xingping, and Liquan, not even chickens and dogs were seen. Along the way, there were people selling wood, the large ones were roof beams, and the small ones were roof rafters, using the sale of demolished houses as a legitimate income. Inside the broken houses, the old and weak moaned incessantly. I personally saw a Mr. Guo, whose family was well-off, had one hectare of land, and more than 30 people, now only had two grandparents and a thin cow left. I also saw people being eaten, buried in a temple with straw mats hired. Those who starved to death along the way were even more numerous. Now there are photos available for reference. After returning to Ping, I appealed to the medical community to donate medicines, and a trainload has been shipped, but it is not enough. In Liquan County alone, there are more than 700 villages, and each village needs ten items, which is also 7,000 items. This can only be done through hard work. This time, I did not dare to delay too much in Shaanxi, fearing that the disaster relief in Pingjin and other places would be suspended, so I returned in a hurry. Please extend the fundraising for one month. The overall cause of the disaster in Shaanxi is indeed because opium was planted in the past, so the land is very barren and cannot grow plants. It has been four years without a harvest. There are more than 40 shelters in the area, housing grandsons, orphans, and the helpless elderly, totaling more than 10,000 people. According to investigations, the number of women sold after passing through Tongguan is more than 200,000. There are widows selling sons, elder brothers selling younger sisters, fathers selling daughters, and husbands selling wives, which is truly unbearable to hear. In a shelter in Tongguan, Fei Lan saw a woman who hid and refused to talk when she saw me (she was caught and detained), probably misunderstanding me as a trafficker. Currently, the places where relief is being continued are Wugong, Fufeng, Liquan, Xingping, and Fucheng. This time, the disaster relief has been selected by charitable organizations from the three northeastern provinces to select cadres who are enthusiastic and hardworking, and take photos and newsreels to spread publicity. The achievements of the fundraising agencies include the Shanghai Jisheng Society's 300,000 yuan, the North China International Famine Relief Commission's 140,000 yuan, and various places in Hubei have disaster relief funds. The places that must be passed through when re-entering Shaanxi, such as Luoyang, Xingan, and Guanyintang, have also been severely affected. Fortunately, the China International Famine Relief Commission has been setting up porridge kitchens along the road for two years, otherwise, the grain entering Shaanxi would have been in danger of being robbed." Then, the staff of the Disaster Relief Association asked Zhu to regularly report on the Shaanxi disaster to the people of this province, so as to promote the benevolent heart of the people to donate. It was decided on the spot that at 5:00 PM on the 19th, a public lecture would be held at the old site of the Education Association outside Xihua Gate, displaying Shaanxi disaster photos and the tree bark and vegetable roots eaten by the disaster victims for people to view. It is reported that the results of the disaster relief here, as of the 16th, only amounted to more than 26,000 yuan. (June 16th)</p>
<h3>Shenyang Massacre Case Transferred to Court</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The case of the massacre of eight lives that shocked the provincial capital, the principal offenders Pi Guochen and You Qisan, and the suspects Gu Zizhang, Pi's wife Lu, You's wife Wu, Li Peiqin's ex-wife Huo, Deng Haiquan's mother Wang, Huo Lixun, Xu Deyou, Xiong Li, and the informant Shang Chengfu and other eleven people, have been interrogated repeatedly by the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital. Pi has confessed to the murders, but You's confession is cunning and has not yet revealed the truth. The chief culprit in the case, Deng Haiquan, is still at large. The bureau believes that although this case involves murder, it is different from robbery and murder. Therefore, at 2:00 PM on the 16th, the principal offenders and eleven suspects were escorted to the Shenyang District Court Prosecutor's Office in a prisoner transport vehicle with eight police officers to be tried. All the prisoners were tied with ropes around their arms. Pi and You were wearing heavy shackles. Pi was wearing a blue shirt and trousers, with a dirty face and swollen red eyes. You was wearing a green satin jacket and trousers, with a rather sad expression. After getting out of the car, they were all sent to prison to await trial. Because Pi and You were wearing foot shackles, which had to be taken back by the police, You cried out for injustice while the shackles were being changed at the Prosecutor's Office. Tears followed the sound, and he asked the guards if they were torturing people here. The guards answered no, and You stopped crying. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Chief Prosecutor Sun Honglin and the Chief Prosecutor Xue Shuping of the Prosecutor's Office questioned them in closed session. The interrogation was completed at 7:30 PM. Pi Guochen, You Qisan, Gu Zizhang, and Li Huo were returned to prison. The other seven, who were deemed to have no major involvement, were released on bail. (17th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>First District Office Prepares for Price Stabilization of Rice</p>
<p>The county is organizing price stabilization efforts for rice, allocating funds to sixteen districts, with each district chief responsible for implementation. Zhong Taichi, the first district chief, considering the importance of this matter and the need for proper prior planning to ensure smooth progress, convened a meeting yesterday (the 23rd) with district reorganization committee members, township heads, and local figures to discuss implementation methods. It was discussed that purchasing rice from Shanghai required immediate payment. The funds allocated to the district were specifically for offsetting losses, so the purchase of rice required substantial capital. The budget was initially for 800 bags, requiring an advance of ten thousand yuan. It was proposed to borrow funds from a bank and establish a line of credit for circulation. After deliberation, everyone agreed to establish a Price Stabilization Committee, nominating Wu Bogeng, Xu Chunbo, Yin Baoyi, Yuan Mu'an, Chen Liuzhang, Zhang Jiliang, and Yu Kui'sheng as committee members. A Supervisory Committee was also formed, nominating Zhang Xiangshan, Yao Xiangfu, and Yang Tianduo as members. Eight branch offices will be established within the first district: (1) Fucheng Temple, headed by Gu Wangyun and Zhang Qingquan; (2) Wengong Temple, headed by Yang Yongyi and Yu Kui'sheng; (3) Dongmenkou, headed by Yang Shouqin and Zhang Xiangshan; (4) Huayang Bridge, headed by Xu Chunbo and Xi Weiquan; (5) Xilin Temple, headed by Zhang Sansheng and Zhu Hesun; (6) Dacang Bridge, headed by Xu Yinglin and Zhang Jiliang; (7) Baiwo Temple, headed by Chen Liuzhang and Wang Zhongyi; (8) Longxing Township, headed by Zhang Baoliang and Xu Shougen. The branch office staff will serve on a voluntary basis, and the committee will be convened regularly before adjourning.</p>
<p>Suspicious Incident of Drugging a Girl</p>
<p>A young girl named Jiang, residing in Lou County Street, encountered a monk and a Western-dressed man yesterday. She was lured to the Xiao Wang Temple, given two copper coins, and then the Western-dressed man took out a medicine bottle and applied a small amount to the girl's cheeks, immediately causing scorch marks to appear. She returned home and told her mother, who reported it to the First District Police Station for investigation. According to the monk Lin Chao, he was introduced by Hengguang, a monk from the Ciyuan Temple, and did not know the Western-dressed man. The Western-dressed man, identified as Liang Zhongyao from Guangdong, stated that he came to Songjiang to promote the Henghai Pharmaceutical Company's products and that the liquid applied to the girl's cheeks was for testing purposes. Hengguang also stated that he only met Liang once at Putuo Mountain. However, when questioned why he didn't stay in a hotel or buy medicine from a temple, and how he could develop his business, he remained silent. The police station, suspecting foul play, ordered them to be taken to headquarters for further investigation. As a result, it was decided to wait until the girl Jiang's injuries healed after a week for further verification. Liang Zhongyao was released on bail from the Zhongnan Hotel. The girl's mother is very worried about whether the scorch marks on her cheeks will return to normal.</p>

<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Follow-up Inquiry into the Jin Zhou Wine Case</p>
<p>Zhou Weixin from Ximen previously accused Jin Boqin, a standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, of theft after the Public Security Bureau, together with Jin Boqin, raided his home and confiscated alcohol. The county government summoned them for questioning and sent the confiscated alcohol to the Central Health Testing Institute for chemical analysis. The results showed no toxic substances, and the county government decided not to prosecute Zhou. Zhou's accusation against Jin and others for theft was later resolved amicably, and a request was made to drop the case. Now, Zhou has submitted another petition to the county government, claiming that someone borrowed his name and denying the withdrawal of the original case. It is also rumored that a Mr. Huang from Nanxiang, feeling indignant on his behalf, intends to take the position of a third party and file an administrative lawsuit against Jin and others.</p>
<p>Arrest of Kidnappers</p>
<p>Lu Fu from Tongzhou and Bao A'er from Wuxi lured Shen A'er, a woman from Haining, to Jiading to sell her. They were hiding at the home of Fan Peiyuan, an ant mediator in Dongxiang. The County Public Security Bureau learned of this and ordered the detective team to arrest them.

<p>Labor Strike at Deda Yu Silk Factory</p>
<p>The Deda Yu Silk Factory on Jin Feng Road, Zhou Shan Bang, outside Guangfu Gate in this county, has a total of 480 silk reeling machines. Since the start of operations, the relationship between labor and management has been fairly harmonious. Recently, various foreign firms in Shanghai required that the silk from the inland factories sent to Shanghai must first be examined for Evenness (Ivenness, as they called it), and the minimum requirement must be 80 points or higher to pass, otherwise it would be rejected. Therefore, manager Wang Dingfa convened a meeting of all factory workers to discuss starting with serious work. The work director, Wang Yunsheng, and the standing committee of the factory's labor union discussed the problem of eyelets, and the goal was to achieve 80 points or higher. The standing committee of the labor union sought the consent of all the factory workers, but the workers felt that they were already working diligently and that other factories in Wuxi did not have the Evenness requirement. They refused and staged a temporary strike after lunch the day before yesterday, stopping work and refusing to enter the factory. The factory saw that the workers had gone on strike and immediately closed the factory gates to seek a solution. At the same time, it reported the situation to the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau by telephone. The branch chief sent officer Zhang Zhong'an with police officers to the factory to maintain order. The General Labor Union also received a report from the factory and sent investigator Xie Bin to the factory to inquire. The Silk Factory Workers' Union also sent mediator Ding Shaochu to investigate the truth of the strike. Yesterday, Tao Shengsheng, a standing member of the Silk Factory Workers' Union, went to the factory to mediate. The factory stated that it would not change the workers' benefits or treatment, but hoped that they would improve their work. Mr. Tao asked the factory to be considerate of the workers and gradually rectify the situation. Mediation is currently underway, and it is expected that work will resume soon.</p>

<p>The Department of Finance Sets a Time Limit for Clearing Tax Payments</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance stated that taxes such as pig, fish, rice, and paddy taxes, as well as the 10% and 20% surcharges collected by various tax bureaus, are all related to important disbursement needs and should be cleared on a ten-day basis in accordance with regulations.

<h3>Summer Education Administration Outline of the Guangdong Education Department (II) Yi Lu</h3>
<p>Second, (Secondary Education) A. Planning for the qualitative improvement of provincial secondary schools in the next academic year: The current situation of provincial schools in the province, including one vocational school, one business school, thirteen middle schools, one girls' middle school, six normal schools, and one girls' normal school, has been reported to the department after the completion of the provincial supervisor's inspection this year. It is planned to strictly plan the methods for improving the quality of each school based on the report, and issue orders for compliance and practical improvement, aiming for perfection. B. Urging the submission of new student rosters and academic records for the seventeenth academic year: A list of new students from each school should be submitted within one month of students entering the school, and academic record sheets for each school should be submitted within one month of the end of the academic year. These should be verified by the department and reported to the Ministry of Education for record-keeping. It has been found that many schools have not submitted their new student rosters for this year and the academic records of students at all levels for the seventeenth academic year on time. It is planned to issue a notice to expedite the submission to facilitate review and processing. C. Investigating the principals of various middle schools and strictly verifying their qualifications: The qualifications for principals of secondary schools have long been stipulated. Principals of county and city middle schools are selected and appointed by the county and city in accordance with regulations, and principals of private secondary schools are elected by the board of directors and submitted to the county and city for reporting and record-keeping. This has been communicated and implemented on record. Currently, it has been found that the qualifications of some secondary school principals do not meet the requirements, and they are not reported for appointment and record-keeping in accordance with regulations. It is planned to have the department formulate an investigation form and issue a notice to all counties and cities to fill it out within a specified period for assessment. D. Opening vocational crash courses: Vocational education must adapt to local conditions and the needs of the times. Vocational schools in this province are still lacking. It is now planned to establish vocational crash courses within the provincial industrial vocational school, selecting those that are urgently needed, beneficial for practical application, and cost-effective to implement first, in order to train junior industrial talents to meet the demand. The specific courses to be offered will be determined by the principal of the provincial industrial vocational school and submitted to the department for approval and implementation. E. Registering qualified middle school teachers: Registering qualified middle school teachers was listed in the previous administrative plan but not yet implemented. It should be continued. F. Improving the manual arts courses in provincial secondary schools: The manual arts courses in secondary schools have historically paid little attention to practical application. Since the provincial No. 1 middle school was designated as a pilot school last year, the school has increased the manual arts time by one hour per week, established workshops to manufacture applied items, and gradually modified classroom desks and chairs with rattan, bamboo, wood, and other materials, achieving considerable results. The students' knowledge and skills in crafts are more accurate and refined than before. The development of their minds, the training of their hands and eyes, and the cultivation of virtues such as diligence, thrift, and patience are also noticeably effective. It is planned to issue a notice to all provincial secondary schools to participate in the methods of the No. 1 middle school within the scope of the annual budget, and make appropriate improvements to improve the efficiency of the course. G. Adjusting the regulations for checking the age and height of students in provincial schools: Orders should be issued immediately to the affiliated schools to comply with and implement them. The weight, height, and actual age of students in provincial secondary schools should be supervised and checked by the department's supervisors for comparison. It is planned to organize and implement this when the supervisors depart this semester. After the inspection is completed, a comparison table will be created and submitted to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health for record-keeping. H. Urging the registration of established private secondary schools: The regulations for private school boards, private school registration, and private school rules have been promulgated repeatedly. All schools should comply with and implement them. It has been found that private middle schools in various counties and cities often do not report their establishment in accordance with procedures. Whether their operations are legal is impossible to assess, and it is negligent for counties and cities not to ban them from violating orders. It is planned to issue a notice to all counties and cities that private middle schools under their jurisdiction that have been established but not reported must report in accordance with regulations before the eighteenth academic year. I. Conducting a detailed inspection of established secondary schools: The curriculum of the established secondary schools in various places, whether they comply with the regulations, whether the equipment is legal, whether the allocation of funds is appropriate, whether the teachers are qualified, whether they are dedicated to training, and whether the students' level and school discipline are good, should be carefully inspected by provincial supervisors and reported in detail to facilitate reorganization. At the same time, orders should be issued to various counties and cities to supervise and urge at any time, and when submitting the annual report forms of various secondary schools, they should add practical evaluations or rectification and improvement suggestions to the report on the school's operations for that year for review. J. Preparing a summer training course for secondary school teachers: Good teachers must have considerable self-cultivation. The self-cultivation of secondary school teachers is particularly important. It is planned to organize a summer training course for secondary school teachers by the department during the summer vacation of the nineteenth academic year, and notify teachers from public and private secondary schools throughout the province to attend the training course. The detailed methods for the time to be spent on member discussions and the time to be spent on lectures by education experts will be determined by the department and circulated for compliance. K. Formulating summer remedial measures for secondary schools: Secondary schools adopt a credit system. If a student is absent beyond the limit or fails, the credits for that subject should be made up. The current ranking system of secondary schools is not yet perfect. If remedial measures are not taken, it will be difficult to make up the credits, which will inevitably delay graduation. It is now planned that public and private secondary schools should uniformly set up summer remedial classes during the summer vacation of the nineteenth academic year. Students whose academic records for the eighteenth academic year are less than 60 points must attend the summer remedial classes for remedial study. The detailed methods will be determined by the department and circulated for compliance.</p>

<h3>Dean Cheng of the Business School Agreed to Resume Office</h3>
<p>As a Result of the Vigorous Mediation of Acting Dean Yang</p>
<p>Since Dean Cheng Zhenji of the Business School of National Central University submitted his resignation, after much deliberation, President Zhang approved his leave of absence, and the affairs of the school were temporarily managed by Yang Yinpu, the former director of academic affairs, as acting dean. For several months, progress has been as usual. Recently, because Acting Dean Yang was engaged in writing, coupled with the accumulation of school affairs, his energy was exhausted, and he urgently wanted to get rid of it to fulfill his long-cherished wish. Therefore, last month, he repeatedly asked the president to urge Cheng to cancel his leave and return to the school to take charge. Colleagues in the school also sent letters to persuade him to come back. It is reported that Cheng has harmonious feelings with the teachers and students of the school over the years, and because of the persuasion from all parties, he could not refuse and has agreed to return to the school to preside over affairs soon. It is expected that he will arrive at the school on August 1. After that, the school will have Cheng's renewed leadership and far-reaching plans for all matters, and the school will have a new look.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Customs Officials Have Not Arrived</h3>
<p>No Telegram from Tianjin, News Remains Silent</p>
<p>Since Yan Xishan of Shanxi appointed Xin Bosen as the head of the Tianjin Customs, the Inspector General of Customs has instructed all Tianjin Customs officials to resign. This reporter visited the Deputy Inspector General of Customs at the Inspectorate General of Customs yesterday, and he said that since the previous instruction was issued, news from Tianjin has been silent, and no telegrams have been received. The truth is unknown. Recently, no Tianjin Customs officials have come to Shanghai, and the facts are even more difficult to understand. It is still difficult to predict what steps should be taken in the future. The former Customs Director, Bell, may not be able to come to Shanghai for a while because he is handling various matters with the resigned officials in Tianjin.</p>
<p>After the Northern Army forcibly occupied the Tianjin Customs, the National Government expressed serious concern. The Japanese Acting Minister Chongguang telegraphed the Japanese government for instructions and reported in detail on the Tianjin Japanese Consul's handling of customs silver. Yesterday, Acting Minister Chongguang received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ordering him to promptly stop the Tianjin Japanese Consul's actions of collecting customs silver on behalf of the Customs. On the one hand, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is studying the matter and will send another telegram to Acting Minister Chongguang to express its views. After receiving the telegram, Chongguang telegraphed the Tianjin Japanese Consul, ordering him to stop collecting customs silver and other actions.</p>
<p>Merchants Cope</p>
<h3>Tianjin Customs Tariff Issue</h3>
<p>Foreign Merchants Hand Over to Consulates</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Have No Recourse</p>
<p>With the recent forced collection of Tianjin customs duties in the north, the northern shipping lines of Shanghai, as well as the export business of merchants and goods, have been greatly affected. Furthermore, the customs tariff issue has given rise to special measures. The following is a record of the situation as it unfolded yesterday, divided into sections:</p>
<p>New Tax Payment Method for Foreign Merchants Announced by the Jianghai Customs: For goods exported from Shanghai to Tianjin, the standard half-tax should be paid. Due to the forced collection of Tianjin customs duties in the north, the import half-tax paid for each item of goods arriving in Tianjin must also be paid at the time of export in Shanghai. Various foreign merchants in this port have discussed this matter multiple times. The payment of this half-tax in Shanghai or Tianjin does not pose a problem for foreign merchants. However, there are concerns that if the north still insists on forceful collection when the goods arrive in Tianjin, there will be significant losses. It is reported that various foreign merchants have agreed to follow the precedent set when Sun Chuanfang imposed additional customs duties in previous years. They will temporarily request that each of their respective consulates collect the import half-tax for goods shipped by foreign merchants to Tianjin, with neither party paying it. At the same time, they will notify both the Tianjin and Shanghai customs offices, stating that the tax payments will be transferred once the issue is formally resolved. The customs clearance procedures for foreign merchants' goods will also be handled by their respective consulates. It was heard yesterday that this has already been decided, and foreign merchants in Tianjin will also handle it in the same way.</p>
<p>Piece Goods and Miscellaneous Grains Stop Being Shipped to Tianjin: The shipping of piece goods to Tianjin had only just begun. Recently, a customs seizure incident suddenly occurred. The various merchant guilds in Shanghai, fearing the loss of paying double taxes and lacking the authority granted to foreign merchants through consular jurisdiction as protection, have stopped loading piece goods and miscellaneous grains for Tianjin since yesterday. It is expected that starting today, there will be a greater shortage of goods exported from Shanghai's northern shipping lines, with only sporadic goods being loaded.</p>
<p>British Ships Also Serve Dalian: The regular northern shipping lines of the three companies in Shanghai have never gone to Dalian, only to Yantai and Weihaiwei. Now, due to changes in customs tax collection and orders changing the handling of Tianjin goods, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. in Shanghai decided yesterday to change the regular Tianjin ships to serve Dalian Bay, in order to remedy the clear declarations of import and export goods.</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Strictly Prohibits</p>
<h3>Sailors from Taking Rice Out of the Country</h3>
<p>And Crackdowns on Illegal Rice Shops</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau recently received reports from citizens stating that the customs office has regulations regarding the quantity of rice for export on each ship, such as 133 bags for ships going to the United States and 100 bags for ships going to the United Kingdom. However, sailors often smuggle rice after customs officers have inspected, or repeatedly load the same customs declaration to deceive customs officials. Rice shops in the area of Outer Hongkou and the opposite side of Pudong engage in this trade, colluding with sailors. It is estimated that a considerable amount of high-quality rice is smuggled out each year. The bureau considers that the city's food supply has been in a state of constant panic in recent years. Such mixed and concealed exports not only harm customs regulations but also hinder the city's food supply. Therefore, the bureau sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, requesting that the tax authorities be instructed to order all customs officers to conduct strict inspections. It also instructed the rice merchant industry organization committee to warn its members not to engage in this illegal trade and to report any violations truthfully for investigation.</p>
<h3>Issue of Losses from Low-Priced Rice</h3>
<p>Committee Chairman Requests Instructions</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang Urges Collection</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Shanghai Special Municipality Rice Price Stabilization Committee, submitted a document to the Municipal Government yesterday due to losses from price stabilization and difficulties in fundraising, stating: "Submitting a report. The proceedings of the first and second meetings of this committee have already been reported. Given the significant losses from the sale of low-priced rice, we specially convened various committee members yesterday to discuss relief measures. Everyone agreed that the imported rice purchased by this committee should be priced between 15 yuan and 15.5 yuan per stone based on the recent market prices of rice shops. However, rice shops have leeway in terms of jin, liang, sheng, and he, so the selling price of this committee should be lower than the market price, hence setting the selling price at 14.5 yuan per stone, based on 200 pounds. The losses in processing were originally intended to be compensated by donations from various public organizations. It was previously estimated that various parties would allocate at least 100,000 to 150,000 yuan, but as of today, only about 50,000 yuan has been received by the city bank, which is a significant shortfall. This matter concerns the public interest of the entire city, and there must be people who are generous in donating. It is requested that Your Excellency make a high-profile appeal, and the results will surely be more impressive. This is a particularly urgent request for review." (Omitted below). It is now known that Mayor Zhang, after reading the report, instructed the committee yesterday to review the resolution on the matter of loss amounts, and that the committee should be responsible for urging various parties to pay the full amount before submitting it for review and approval.</p>
<h3>French Envoy Will Proceed to Beijing to Present Credentials</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Telegram Was Sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Set a Date</p>
<p>Will Visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Before Going North</p>
<p>Two Academic Groups Welcomed Him the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Since arriving in Shanghai, the new French Minister to China, Mr. Wilden, has been constantly feted. Originally, he planned to go to Beiping first before heading south to Nanjing. Yesterday, he changed his plans and decided to proceed to Nanjing first to present his credentials, meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Foreign Minister Wang, and discuss various Sino-French negotiations, before heading north. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Chen Shiguang from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs visited Mr. Wilden on Qiqi Road to inquire about his plans. According to Wilden, he had already telegraphed the French consulate in Beijing in the morning, asking them to forward it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to set a date for presenting credentials and meeting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He would proceed to Beijing as soon as he received a reply. Chen Shiguang also sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the name of the office yesterday to report this. It is likely that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs still needs to telegraph Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the front lines for instructions. As of last night, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet replied, so the date for the French envoy's visit to Beijing has not been determined.</p>
<p>The World Academy at 393 Foch Road in this port and the Shanghai Office of the Sino-French University jointly invited people from all walks of life in China and France to a meeting at 4:00 PM on the 22nd of this month to welcome the new French Minister to China, Mr. and Mrs. Wilden. Among those who attended were French Minister Wilden, French Consul General Juran, French Chief Inspector Fawo, and the manager of the Sino-French Bank, among many others. On the Chinese side, there were Li Shizeng, Wei Daoming, Zhang Qun, Zheng Yuxiu, Kong Xiangxi, Hu Ruoyu, Yi Peiji, Cai Yuanpei, Wu Zhihui, Wang Jingqi, Yang Zhaoxun, Li Minghuan, Wang Xiaolai, Li Zongkan, Wei Tingrong, Chen Shiguang, and other male and female guests, totaling over a hundred people. After champagne and refreshments were served, Li Shizeng stood up to deliver a welcome speech, which roughly stated: "Today, the World Academy and the Sino-French University jointly welcome the new French Minister. The names of these two academies, as the names suggest, are related to international culture, especially to the close relationship between Chinese and French international culture. Although the form of today's welcome is very simple, its significance is very important. France is an advanced country in democratic republic, which has greatly benefited our country's political system. Mr. Wilden is well-versed in China's situation. His fluency in Chinese is better than my fluency in French, and he has a close relationship with our late Premier Sun Yat-sen. When he served as the Consul General in Shanghai in the past, he provided much assistance to our late Premier Sun Yat-sen. Now that Mr. Wilden has returned to the old place and been promoted to Minister, I cannot help but congratulate Mr. Wilden. I especially cannot help but celebrate the future of cultural exchange between China and France. With this glass of wine, I respectfully wish you good health." Next, Wilden stood up to give a reply, roughly saying: "I have previously spent six years in Sichuan and five years in Yunnan. In total, I have spent more years in China than in France, so I have deeply imbibed Chinese customs. As the saying goes, what one is accustomed to from childhood becomes one's nature, and habit becomes second nature. Therefore, the French habits I have imbibed are relatively few. I originally loved to speak Chinese, but in the six years since I left China, I have traveled to countries such as Myanmar and Siam, so although I wanted to speak Chinese, I lacked the opportunity and have forgotten much, which is a pity. Today, returning to this old place is truly like returning to my hometown. I feel very happy. However, I feel that today's customs are very different from the past. Women who used to stay at home are now filling the streets. The progress of culture is rapid and extraordinary, which can be seen from this. In the future, regarding Sino-French cultural undertakings, if there are any areas where we can support each other, I will be happy to do so. With this glass of wine, I return the wishes for your well-being." A round of applause erupted. After taking photos, the gathering dispersed around 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>Liu Jiwen, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, took the night train to Beijing last night to attend tomorrow's Central Political Conference to report on his views on the silver crisis of relief funds, as well as the status of import and export tax revenue.

<p>The issue of recovering the telephone rights in the concessions is being negotiated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Recently, there was a rumor that it would be transferred to a certain international company, which greatly angered the citizens of Shanghai. At 11:00 AM yesterday, Chen Shiguang, Director of the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, specifically visited the leading consul, Mr. Cunningham, regarding this matter. Mr. Cunningham was in a meeting and could not meet him. He was received by the Acting Consul General of the United States, who said that the consular body plans to convene a meeting in the coming days to discuss the telephone sales issue in detail. A formal reply will be given once a result is reached. Chen has already telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report this.</p>
<h3>The Consular Body Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Discuss the Issue of Wage Increases for River Pilots and Seamen on Ships</p>
<p>The consular body of various countries stationed in Shanghai held a temporary joint meeting at the Consulate General of the United States in Shanghai at 2:00 PM yesterday. In addition to all the consuls of the consular body attending the meeting, the Director of the Port Authority, the Chief Inspector of Customs, and representatives from the River Pilots' Association were also present. The proposal discussed was the request for wage increases by river pilots and seamen of various countries. The discussion resulted in the general consensus that, due to the high cost of silver, the high price of goods, and the increase in the cost of living, the request for wage increases was indeed unavoidable. However, at the same time, the maritime industry was also affected by the high cost of silver, resulting in significant losses and difficulty in maintaining operations. Therefore, it was difficult to grant this request. It is now proposed that labor and management should negotiate with each other to determine a compromise solution. Starting from July 1st, the contracts originally scheduled to expire in June will be implemented. The contracts will be modified at the time of expiration to ensure that both labor and management benefit. The detailed measures have not yet reached the point of being announced.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Letter Bureaus Will Continue to Operate as Before</h3>
<p>The Federation of Overseas Chinese Sends a Telegram to the Shantou Wholesale Industry Association</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation of the Republic of China telegraphed the various wholesale bureaus of the Shantou Overseas Chinese Wholesale Industry Association yesterday, stating: "Case review: The case of changing the Overseas Chinese Wholesale Bureaus to special postal agencies for mailing has been repeatedly disputed by our federation's representative, Mr. Chen Zhiying, and others through letters and telegrams. They also discussed measures with Mr. Zhou Yundong, a specialist from the Postal Administration. On the 22nd of May, they jointly telegraphed the Postal Administration on behalf of the National Federation of Commerce, requesting that it continue to operate as before. On June 21st, the Postal Administration approved Letter No. 809, stating that the Shantou Overseas Chinese Wholesale Industry Association strongly objected to the change of private letter bureaus to special postal agencies for mailing, believing it was unacceptable. Mr. Zhou Yundong, a specialist, and Mr. Chen Zhiying, the chief representative of our association, discussed and agreed on appropriate measures. It was decided to instruct the Shantou wholesale industry to obtain registration certificates from the post office, and other regulations can be waived. Please approve this and send Mr. Zhou, a specialist, to Shantou to handle the matter together with the Shantou Postal Administration. We approve this. Upon investigation, the reason for the general contract method for private bureaus operating overseas is that the British Malaya (Kuala Lumpur) Post Office repeatedly requested to ban it. Therefore, it is proposed to change the names of various private bureaus to special postal agencies for mailing in order to cope with this. Now that the British Malaya Post Office no longer insists on the original proposal, all methods, including general contracts and the affixing of postage stamps outside the packages, have been restored to the old rules. The names of private bureau wholesale industries and their registration procedures can also continue to be handled according to the old regulations. We immediately submitted a report for review and approval. Now we have received Instruction No. 2666 from the Ministry of Communications, stating that approval is granted as proposed. The Shantou wholesale industry should immediately comply with the old regulations. Those who have already registered should quickly exchange their registration certificates at the post office. Those who have not registered should quickly request registration and obtain certificates from the post office in order to uniformly enjoy the benefits of general contracts. As Mr. Zhou Yundong, a specialist, has other tasks at the moment, he is unable to go to Shantou. All procedures that need to be handled can be directly requested from the Shantou Postal Administration. In addition to ordering the Shantou Administration to comply, we are corresponding with your association for verification. Please forward the telegram to the wholesale industry association for notification and handling. Thank you. The Overseas Chinese Federation bows in respect."</p>

<h3>County Public Security Funds Resolved</h3>
<p>Half of the Funds Will Be Allocated by the Shanghai Municipal Government Starting This Month</p>
<p>The issue of public security funds for Shanghai County has been entangled in disputes over the allocation of funds between the province and the municipality. The municipal government has suspended the allocation of subsidies for a year. The public security funds for Shanghai County are entirely dependent on subsidies from the municipal government and have no other income. For the past year, the county has been patching things together with great difficulty, to the point where it has almost been unable to maintain even basic food supplies. County Magistrate Yan was ordered to come to Shanghai this time. While in the province, he personally presented the actual situation of the county to Chairman Ye and Directors Chen and Hu. He also repeatedly met with Mayor Zhang to report and request assistance. The core issue was the unclear funds between the province and the municipality. County Magistrate Yan personally went to Zhenjiang to explain the situation to the provincial government authorities. Subsequently, the provincial government meeting resolved to order the Finance Department to send personnel to audit the accounts and requested the municipal government to verify. However, the county government believed that auditing the accounts would take time, and the police funds were exhausted, so it submitted a document to the municipal government requesting that it continue to allocate funds as before, starting this month. At the same time, County Magistrate Yan repeatedly met with Mayor Zhang, explaining the difficult situation. Mayor Zhang was deeply concerned about the lack of public security funds, which would affect local security, so he instructed the county government the day before yesterday that half of the funds would be allocated from this month onwards to maintain the current situation. After receiving the order, the county government will submit a document to the Municipal Finance Bureau in the coming days to claim the funds in order to maintain the status quo.</p>
<h3>Various Railway Bureaus Will Trial Use Mandarin Telegraphs</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, Minister of Railways, noted that the Chinese telegraph codes used by various railway bureaus require repeated translations during transmission and reception, which is time-consuming. Therefore, he plans to adopt a new type of Mandarin telegraph to save time. He ordered the Beijing-Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Tianjin-Pukou railways to select a few telegraph operators to study at the ministry for three months. It is learned that the first batch of trainees graduated on the 20th of this month with excellent results. They will soon return to their respective railway bureaus to work. The second batch is currently being selected. Once the majority of the training is completed perfectly, the various railway bureaus will begin to trial use Mandarin telegraphs.</p>
<h3>News on the French Business Water and Electricity Workers' Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>The strike by workers in the French Business Water and Electricity Company's engine department has lasted for five days. Although the factory has hired more than 20 White Russians to repair temporarily, they can only repair very common machine parts. Therefore, many public buses, trackless trams, and trams have been damaged in the continuous rainy days, resulting in only three or four trams running on lines 6 and 10 from Lujiazui to the 16th Pier, and passengers have to wait for half an hour. If the strike is extended further, it is feared that it will affect transportation.</p>
<p>Preventing Water Pipe Repairs: At around 8:00 AM yesterday, because the company hired other workers to repair water pipes at the South Railway Station, it almost led to a major incident. The French Business Water Company was installing a main water pipe at the west side of the South Railway Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, passing through the railway tracks and connecting to Lujiazui. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 AM yesterday, the main water pipe suddenly broke, bursting for about four feet. Therefore, the company immediately sent five French personnel to rush to repair it. Considering that the original workers were on strike, the company hired more than 20 road workers from the Public Works Department. The police ordered detectives to go to the scene together to repair it. Suddenly, more than a hundred old workers came, each holding wooden sticks, to prevent the work. The garrison command heard the news and sent Deputy Officer Chen with many armed soldiers, together with Officer Niu from the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Gaochang Temple Police Station, to suppress the situation. The workers claimed that no one could work until the strike was resolved. The company's hiring of other workers would leave them with no way to survive, so they came together to prevent the work. Fortunately, Lou, the police chief of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Police Department, led patrol officers such as Jian Huanluan, along with armed police officers, assisted Deputy Officer Chen and Officer Niu from the garrison command, and Chief Inspector Wang Jingfu from the resident military police, to mediate and earnestly persuade the workers. The workers dispersed at around 11:00 AM, and the work was able to continue. It is heard that the water pipe will be repaired at around 2:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Group Leader Joint Meeting: The French Business Water and Electricity Workers' Union held a joint meeting of all group leaders at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Xu A'mei was elected as chairman to discuss and resolve the following proposals: (1) (Omitted) (2) During the strike, the factory will pay the wages of workers in various departments as usual. (3) Request the company to guarantee the workers. (4) Request the expulsion of White Russians from the factory.</p>
<h3>The Shaanxi Relief Grain Transportation Was Not Robbed</h3>
<p>A Telegram Declaration from Zhu Qinglan</p>
<p>Nie Qijie received a letter from Zhu Ziqiao dated June 2nd, which stated: "I respectfully acknowledge your inquiry about the Shaanxi relief grain being robbed on May 27th. This is entirely fabricated. I, Lan, returned to Ping from Shaanxi the night before last. This trip to Shaanxi was for on-site investigation. I visited counties such as Xianyang, Xingping, and Liquan, and found that in most cases, nine out of ten houses were empty. Homes were torn down, and cooking stoves and farm equipment were all gone. Only about one-tenth of the wheat was planted. Furthermore, due to windstorms, the pea crops were infested with insects, resulting in a complete loss. Six or seven out of ten disaster victims died. Those who barely survived are now suffering from epidemics, and the miserable situation is beyond description. Your generous donation for disaster relief came at the right time and saved many lives. However, the disaster area is too large. I hope kind-hearted people will continue to promote and provide continuous assistance to save those on the verge of death. I am deeply grateful."</p>
<p>Another telegram received stated: "I have respectfully read your letter. I deeply admire your concern for the Shaanxi disaster. I, Lan, personally went to Shaanxi Province twice to investigate the disaster-stricken counties. People from various charitable organizations were seen investigating and providing relief along the roads. Not only was none of the grain and funds in my hands robbed, but also in the past two years, no losses have been reported in the grain and funds transported and distributed by various charitable groups. I, Lan, can guarantee this. The more than 20,000 bags of grain stored in Tianjin have already been completely transported to the disaster area. Yesterday, because the authorities were still providing trains for transportation, I specifically purchased a trainload of machine-made noodles and cornmeal in Tianjin, which passed Fengtai West today. If there are any obstacles, I would not purchase and transport goods again. I hope you will forward this to the Shanghai newspapers for public announcement to reassure philanthropists not to be misled by rumors and to continue their efforts in relief work. The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, the Chinese Jisheng Association, and the Xiaohui Zishe are all working together with me in the North China Charity Federation organized in Shaanxi, with each organization having its own responsible personnel. I, Lan, have also invited capable personnel from the charity associations of the four provinces of Rehe, Fengtian, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, the Universal Morality Society, and the Pujifojiao Association to continue the investigation and relief efforts in Shaanxi. The first batch of more than 20 people left yesterday and will arrive there one after another. I recently sent a telegram to Mr. Shi Liangcai briefly describing the tragic situation and will continue to send telegrams to Mr. Shi to promote awareness. I, Lan, will go to the eastern provinces to solicit donations immediately and then return to Shaanxi to investigate and provide relief. Please provide guidance at any time. Zhu Qinglan, (deleted)."</p>

The High Court was scheduled to hold a hearing at 2 PM yesterday (23rd), presided over by Zhao Zhengtang, the acting presiding judge of the Third Criminal Court.

Previously, summonses had been issued to Huang Zhu's family, witnesses Qu Xingtai (carpenter master), Qu's wife, and the carpenter's worker Lu Yongqing, as well as Huang's family maids Jin Ma and A Jin.

The hearing concluded, and the sentencing was set for 2 PM on the 27th of this month. The following is a record of the hearing.</p>
<p>Lu Genrong testified that he was 24 years old and from Wuta, Wuxian County. (The judge asked) "What year did you go to the Huang family?" He replied, "In 1927." The judge asked, "What month was it?" He replied, "May." The judge asked, "Did you work in the mansion?" He replied, "Yes, in the mansion. Later, I went to the exchange."

The judge asked, "Was it at home?" He replied, "Yes, at home." The judge asked, "How did you escape afterward?" He replied, "I didn't escape. Because business stopped on June 8th, I went to return the bedding. I went around 8 o'clock and gave it to the madam to check. Then, I took my small leather suitcase, which the madam also looked at. The madam gave me this suitcase." The judge asked, "When did business stop?" He replied, "June 8th." The judge asked, "When did you leave the Huang family?" He replied, "12th, 9 AM."

He replied, "I went at 8 o'clock and came out at 9 o'clock. I haven't been there since." The judge asked, "Before you left, did you see him?" He replied, "He was upstairs. I didn't see him."

The judge asked, "How did he find you in Wusong?" He replied, "Qu Xingtai's carpentry shop was right across from him. I met Qu A'gen. I told him that my business had stopped, and I was going to Wusong. He went to ask Qu A'gen." The judge asked, "How would he go ask Qu Xingtai?" He replied, "Because I often went to Qu Xingtai's shop." The judge asked, "How did Qu Xingtai know the location in Wusong?" He replied, "I don't have many friends. Huang Genlin often helped me, so he knew." The judge asked, "You testified in the second court that there was an appointment with Qu Xingtai. You left first on the 12th, and you called a car to pick him up on the 13th?" He replied, "I never testified that." (The judge instructed) "(The part about enticement has been decided. It doesn't matter what you testify. We are now examining the theft part)." He replied, "I really didn't testify that. There was too much noise at that time. I'm afraid you misheard me." The judge asked, "Huang Huiru also said that you took the East Forty-Two away on the 12th, and you waited for him on Yuyuan Road?" He replied, "I really don't know what Miss testified." The judge asked, "What did you take away?" He replied, "A small leather suitcase." The judge asked, "What was inside?" He replied, "A servant doesn't have much. Just a few shirts." The judge asked, "Who saw it at that time?" He replied, "No one. Jin Ma and A Jin were upstairs in the old lady's room. The madam was in the study. I had the madam look at it. There was also a gold ring, which I exchanged with my wages." The judge asked, "Besides that, was there anything else?" He replied, "No." The judge asked, "Were there any of Huang Huiru's things?" He replied, "No. When the detectives solved the case, there were no his things in my suitcase, and there were no my things in his suitcase." The judge asked, "Huang Zhu's family became suspicious after you left because of your strange behavior, and they found out about the missing items. They asked Huiru, and Huiru said you took them away?" He replied, "If I took three suitcases when I left, why didn't Madam Huang investigate?" The judge asked, "Did you go to Qu Xingtai as soon as you came out? Why did you go to Qu Xingtai?" He replied, "I walked past their door on Yuyuan Road. Qu A'gen called me. I talked to him in front of the door. I didn't go inside." The judge asked, "Did you have anything to send to his house at that time?" He replied, "No." The judge asked, "When did you meet Huang Huiru?" He replied, "The 13th. He came to Wusong to ask for information." The judge asked, "Where in Wusong?" He replied, "Pudong." The judge asked, "How did he know the location?" He replied, "I had been there with Qu A'gen." The judge asked, "How did you call a car to pick him up?" He replied, "He called a car. I didn't know." The judge asked, "How did you know he called a car?" He replied, "I only found out after asking him in Wusong." The judge asked, "What did you see him take?" He replied, "Nothing. He told me to wait in front of the door. Miss went to Huangpu to get things." The judge asked, "Where did he get them?" He replied, "I don't know." The judge asked, "How many things?" He replied, "Two suitcases." The judge asked, "Any odd bits and pieces?" He replied, "No. The miss's two suitcases were Japanese, one was red." The judge asked, "Did you ask him what was inside?" He replied, "He said everyday clothes." The judge asked, "You testified at the Public Security Bureau that you took the miss and valuable things out?" He replied, "I only found out after they were copied out when the case was solved in Suzhou." The judge asked, "When did he arrive in Wusong?" He replied, "4 PM on the 13th. I originally wanted to send him back to Shanghai, but he said it was easy to go out but difficult to come back. He told me to send him to Aunt Wei's house in Zhujiazhuang, Suzhou. Later, I tried to persuade him, but the more I persuaded him, the more he hated me. I was a servant. I had to listen to him." The judge asked, "After you arrived in Suzhou, where did you live?" He replied, "At the Suzhou Hotel. We stayed there one night. Later, we looked for a house in Zhujiazhuang." The judge asked, "Whose idea was it?" He replied, "Huang Huiru's." The judge asked, "What happened next?" He replied, "We moved to Hulong Street, and soon after, the detective team solved the case." The judge asked, "You didn't know about the valuable things he took for more than ten days?" He replied, "He was very secretive. Even when he took a few dollars, he groped around in secret. I didn't want to ask." The judge asked, "When you testified at the Public Security Bureau, the official asked you how many suitcases you took out, and you answered three?" He replied, "This is because you are referring to two people, so I answered that way. And at that time, I was coerced by them in the detective team." The judge asked, "Recently, in the anti-revolutionary case checked out in prison, they testified that you acted out a new play of the love of Huang and Lu in prison. Did you involve Huang Huiru?" He replied, "No, this is what those political prisoners and anti-revolutionaries did. At that time, I was sick and didn't know." The interrogation concluded, and prosecutor Jin Henian stood up to read the argument, and lawyer Song stood up to defend. Judge Zhao then declared the hearing of the case concluded, and the sentencing was set for 2 PM on the 27th, it was said.</p>
<p>Huang Zhu's conversation: As the hearing was scheduled to begin at 2 PM, the reporter inquired at Huang Zhu's residence as to why Huang Zhu's family was not present. The following is a record of the conversation with Huang Zhu's family: The reporter asked, "Lu Genrong's retrial hearing is being held today. What is the reason for not attending?" They replied, "I didn't receive a summons, so I didn't know." (However, according to the court, the summons was indeed delivered. It is not known whether this was a pretext.) The reporter asked, "If you had received a summons, would you have testified in court?" They replied, "If I had received a summons and knew that the hearing was today, I would have of course gone to court to state the reasons." The reporter asked, "According to court news, after you received the news that Lu Genrong's retrial had been sent back by the Supreme Court, you entrusted lawyer Pan Chenge to draft a statement, stating the reasons and submitting it to the High Court, proving that Lu Genrong did leave on the 12th and took away the miss's belongings, etc. Is this true?" They replied, "It is true that I entrusted lawyer Pan to submit a statement to the High Court. However, it was only to prove the actual situation at that time." The reporter asked, "Is Huang Yongnian healthy?" They replied, "Huang Yongnian was entrusted by Huiru and was unwilling to let Lu Genrong's family take him away. He was entrusted to Zhihua Hospital to be given to someone for adoption. However, I don't know who the hospital gave him to." The reporter asked, "Where is Huang Chengcang currently employed?" They replied, "He is still at the Shanghai Gauze Exchange." The reporter asked, "How was Huang Chengcang's use of a large amount of money from the exchange resolved?" They replied, "The family paid a certain amount to settle the matter."</p>
<p>Lu Genrong's conversation: The reporter had a casual conversation with Lu Genrong as follows: The reporter asked, "Do you still miss Huang Huiru now? If Huiru is still alive, what will you do?" Lu Genrong replied, "If Huiru is really dead, it is still impossible to verify. Therefore, after I (Lu refers to himself) am released from prison, I will definitely publish an advertisement to find Huang Huiru. If she is still alive, my hope is, at the very least, to meet her once. If she is still willing to live with me, I will still want her. If she doesn't come after publishing the advertisement, then I have no choice." The reporter asked, "Your son with Huiru, Huang Yongnian, was taken away by someone from Zhihua Hospital. Do you have any thoughts on this?" Lu Genrong replied, "Zhihua Hospital gave Yongnian to someone without notifying me. Therefore, after I am released from prison, I must ask Zhihua Hospital for him. If there is no way to get him back, then I will definitely file a lawsuit in court to demand his return and sue the hospital." The reporter asked, "Is it true that you recently acted in a play in prison and reversed your role as Huang Huiru?" Lu Genrong replied, "It is not true."</p>

<h3>Opening a Roulette Gambling Den</h3>
<p>Located in White Road, Huai De Lane</p>
<p>Busted by the Zhabei Police Station</p>
<p>Eleven Japanese Men and Women</p>
<p>Many Chinese Nationals Also Involved</p>
<p>Since the roulette gambling den established by foreign national Qiexiya and others was busted by the police last autumn, and the masterminds behind the gambling operation were severely punished according to the law, there have been no such large-scale gambling dens within the public concession area. It has been exactly one year. However, those who make a living by gambling are constantly plotting to resurrect their dead scheme. Now, they have indeed set up a roulette gambling den at No. 213, Huai De Lane, White Road. The house is a two-story building, and the gambling den is located upstairs. All the arrangements are extremely meticulous, and the exterior is also very fancy. Those who are unaware often mistake it for an ordinary residential house. Those who want to gamble, if they are not introduced by acquaintances, not only find it difficult to get inside, but even loitering near the door would result in being driven away. The den has been established for quite some time, and the police authorities were completely unaware. Recently, a detective named Lu Gendi from the General Patrol Room heard a slight rumor. As the area falls under the jurisdiction of the Zhabei Police Station, he informed the detective chief of the station, Wang Changgen, to pay special attention. Every late night, Detective Wang would go to the vicinity of the gambling den alone to investigate. He saw people coming and going, almost non-stop, all night long. After investigating for four or five nights, he was certain that it was a gambling den. Therefore, last Saturday (the 21st) night, he, along with Deputy Detective Cao Asan, Detective Lu Gendi, and Chinese and Western patrol officers Bao Yongshun, and others, secretly went there. They first surrounded the house to prevent anyone from escaping. Then, they pushed open the door and went upstairs. The gamblers were in high spirits, with no way to escape. Some hid in the side rooms, while others tried to escape downstairs, but they were all completely captured without a single rabbit escaping. Only one person, Lu Jusheng, jumped out of the window into a neighbor's patio, but he was eventually apprehended. Then, they began searching. They seized a roulette gambling tool, two pieces of cloth with numbers for the gambling table, 1,596 chips, 98 yuan in banknotes, 65 Japanese yen, as well as silver coins and copper coins, etc. In addition to the gambling equipment, there was also a set of exquisite opium smoking paraphernalia for the gamblers to enjoy and refresh themselves. All items were taken to the police station. Under questioning, it was discovered that among those arrested, there were ten Japanese gamblers belonging to the male sex including Zhong He and others, and one Japanese female. That night, they were handed over to the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai for detention and interrogation. The Chinese gamblers who opened the den, Zhou Wenzhong (also known as Zhou Xiaomao), and gamblers Zhu San, Wu Lin, Zhang Rongxian, Tao Chuanying, Lu Jusheng, and the second landlord of the house, Li Wenming, were separately detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Local Court for investigation. The seized gambling equipment and wooden furniture such as chairs and tables in the gambling den were all transported to the court by car for disposal. At 9:00 AM, Judge Luo took the bench for preliminary hearing. After the Chinese and Western detectives reported the details of the case, according to Zhou Wenzhong's confession, the gambling den was actually established by the Japanese Zhong He, and he was hired by him as the manager. According to Li Wenming's confession, when Zhou and others rented the remaining rooms upstairs, they said they were setting up a club, and he initially did not know that they were renting it as a gambling den. Zhu San and Zhang Rongxian both confessed to gambling on the premises. Wu and Tao claimed to be servants in the gambling den. Lu Jusheng claimed that he was a carpenter and denied gambling on the premises. Detective Wang pointed out that Lu's statement was false and testified that when they went to arrest him, Lu was wearing a white long gown with a copper number plate on his chest, and he was actually a tea server in the gambling den. Now, he falsely claimed to be a carpenter, intending to evade responsibility. Judge Luo then instructed Zhu San and Zhang Rongxian to each pay 50 yuan bail, and the rest were returned to custody for further questioning at a later date. The investigating officers, because the Japanese gamblers who were sent to the Japanese Consulate were also scheduled to be tried yesterday morning, after Judge Luo decided to postpone the hearing, took the more important criminal Zhou Wenzhong to the Japanese Consulate and waited in the police office inside the consulate for the police officer to interrogate the Japanese criminals, so that they could testify. Later, the clerk of the consulate announced that the Japanese gamblers would have to be tried on another scheduled date, and the court hearing would not be held for the time being. Then, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the details of the case to the consulate in detail, and then took Zhou back to the police station for detention.</p>

<h3>Abducted Victim Still in Danger</h3>
<p>Zhang Jiaxiang's Negotiation Suspect</p>
<p>Arrested by the Police for Investigation</p>
<p>Lin Zenrong, the son of wealthy merchant Lin Chunsheng, who resides on Manshi Road in the French Concession, was kidnapped by bandits some time ago. His family has received letters from the bandits demanding a huge ransom for his release. Later, the Lin family entrusted a lawyer's assistant named Zhang Jiaping to negotiate with the bandits twice, and Zhang was taken away with 20,000 yuan in silver, but the victim has not yet been released home. The matter was detected by the French police, who suspected that Zhang Jiaping, having negotiated with the bandits on behalf of the victim's family, had some sort of criminal involvement because the victim had not yet been released. Therefore, they ordered detectives to arrest Zhang and send him to the French court for questioning yesterday. First, the Western detective chief explained the situation, and then Zhang Jiaping testified that he was entrusted by the Lin family to negotiate with the bandits. The first time, he paid 5,000 yuan, and the second time, he paid 15,000 yuan. He did not know why the bandits had not released the victim. He denied any collusion with the bandits and hired a lawyer to defend him. The Chinese and Western officials ordered him to be returned to custody to await the verification and judgment.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<h3>Oppose Increasing the Fare</h3>
<p>Existing Fare Already Too High</p>
<p>Why Increase Prices Again?</p>
<p>The Da Wan Bao reports that the rickshaw pullers in the public concession are on the verge of striking because the rickshaw company issued a notice last Saturday increasing the fare to 13 cents per rickshaw per day. According to the rickshaw pullers, in these days of high rice prices and expensive firewood, the current fare is already too high and they are unable to pay it, let alone an increased price. On Saturday morning, two rickshaw pullers in Gongping Road attempted to remove the tire valves to force the rickshaw pullers to strike, and were arrested by the police. In the afternoon, the rickshaw pullers held a meeting in the jurisdiction of the Harbin Road Police Station, but it was also dispersed by the police.</p>

<h3>Board of Directors of Pushan Maternity Hospital</h3>
<p>Discusses Establishing a Summer Plague Treatment Center</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Board of Directors of the Pushan Maternity Hospital of the White Cross on Xinmin Road, Zhabei, held a meeting at the General Office of Pushan Villa on Six Malu. More than 20 people attended, including Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Hanzhi, Chen Liangyu, Shi Gengyin, Gu Jisheng, Shen Xiechen, and Wang Junsheng. The meeting was held as usual. Chairman Wang Yiting announced the purpose of the meeting. Director Wang Junsheng reported that since the reorganization of the obstetrics department of the hospital, the hospital has continued to provide clinics and medicines to the poor and sick as usual. From January to May of this year, a total of more than 16,000 cases were treated, which required a large amount of resources. On the 16th of this month, the hospital received a letter from the Shanghai Special Municipality Health Bureau, expressing concern for the people's suffering and ordering the establishment of a plague treatment center during the summer season to provide convenient medical treatment for civilians. In recent times, business has been depressed and fundraising has been difficult. However, considering that Zhabei has a dense population and that attention should be paid to epidemic prevention during the summer, we must actively proceed with the implementation and comply with the order. However, the funding is a problem, and we ask all directors to consider local hygiene and generously contribute to establish a temporary plague treatment center as soon as possible to benefit the people. Then, Mr. Shi Gengyin spoke, stating that the director's report was indeed true. However, the hospital has no funds of its own and relies entirely on the enthusiastic support of philanthropists to survive. After discussion, it was agreed that the plague treatment should be prepared as soon as possible, and fundraising should be carried out at any time. It was unanimously agreed to open the treatment center on July 15. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>Special District Local Court</p>
<h3>Increasing Fees for Non-Contentious Matters</h3>
<p>Add 50% to the Original Regulations</p>
<p>Yang Zhaosun, president of the Special District Local Court, plans to add 50% to the fees charged by the court for handling non-contentious matters to increase revenue. However, as the matter involves changing the established regulations, he is not authorized to do so, so he specially submitted it to Xu Weizhen, president of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, who forwarded it to the Judicial Administration Department of the National Government for review and compliance. Now, the order has been received from the Ministry of Justice, approving the proposed increase. The court then decided to implement it starting yesterday, and recorded President Yang's announcement as follows: Announcement: Regarding the matter of the announcement, in accordance with the order of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, which states: Order to comply with the matter, in accordance with the instruction No. 7429 of the Judicial Administration Department, the court's submission of two telegrams stating: It is proposed to add 50% to the fees charged under Articles 2 to 5 of the Interim Rules for the Collection of Fees for Non-Contentious Matters. Please review and instruct to comply. The submission and the telegrams were all read. The request to add 50% to the fees charged under Articles 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Interim Rules for the Collection of Fees for Non-Contentious Matters is feasible and should be approved. You should comply and forward it to the local court to comply. This order, etc. Because of this, the court obeyed and will implement the increase starting on the 23rd of this month. It is hereby announced that all should comply. This announcement.</p>
<p>Dispute Over Inheritance</p>
<h3>New Regulations for Collecting Litigation Fees</h3>
<p>Must Be Based on the Value of the Disputed Estate</p>
<p>Judicial organs used to charge 30 yuan for each case of estate disputes, but now the amount of fees has been changed and must be based on the value of the disputed estate. This new regulation has not been implemented for long, and it may cause harm or benefit to the litigants. Those who are unaware of it must pay the difference at the time of trial. For example, in the case of Gong Chunsheng and Gong Xiangsheng and others in the Special District Local Court, the litigation fee paid was initially only 30 yuan. However, when the case was heard by Judge Xu Wenrong yesterday morning, because the lawsuit did not specify the value of the disputed land, Judge Xu instructed the lawyers of the plaintiff, Wang Fuchang and Yuan Hanyun, to indicate the value of the land in accordance with the current regulations and pay the litigation fee according to the value. Lawyers Wang and Yuan immediately stated that the land was worth about 16,000 yuan and that they would comply with the court's order to withdraw and order the parties to pay the difference. The case was then proceeded with.</p>
<p>Coming to Shanghai to Find Her Husband</p>
<h3>Husband Has Already Taken Another Wife</h3>
<p>Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Quarrel</p>
<p>Causing a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Xu Buqing from Wuxi married a woman surnamed Gu in his hometown in March of the 15th year. At first, they were harmonious, but after only a year, their feelings gradually deteriorated. Xu followed his father to Shanghai to do business, and ordered Gu to take care of her mother-in-law in her hometown. Gu suffered unspeakable hardships because her mother-in-law was difficult to get along with, and her husband did not return home for a long time. For the past three or four years, she has been living in sorrow almost every day. Gu is now 23 years old and does not want to continue living such a hard life. She went to Shanghai alone and stayed at No. 86 Shanxi Road, looking for her husband's whereabouts. On the 30th of last month, she finally learned that her husband was living at No. 42 Fulin Lane, Lafayette Road in the French Concession, so she went to him. Her father-in-law was also there, as well as a young woman who treated the father-in-law with great respect as a daughter-in-law. Gu was surprised and asked her father-in-law who the woman was. The father-in-law said happily, "This is the wife I took for my son." Gu was very angry and realized the reason why her husband's feelings for her had deteriorated and why he had abandoned her halfway. She thought that her father-in-law had taken a second wife for his son, causing her son to commit bigamy. Since the father-in-law was not behaving as a father, the daughter-in-law should not behave as a daughter-in-law. Therefore, a big quarrel broke out, followed by a fight. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law had a big fight. As a result, Gu was beaten with firewood and suffered injuries all over her body. She hired a lawyer to sue Xu Buqing for abandonment and injury in the Special District Local Court. Xu's mistress, Shi, was also listed as a defendant, requesting that they be punished according to the law. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court for trial, but both defendants were absent. According to their lawyer, Xu Buqing was still in the hospital recovering from his injuries, and requested that the case be postponed for ten days, and that he would surrender himself as soon as he recovered. Judge Wu first questioned the plaintiff, Xu Gu, and then approved the postponement of the trial for ten days.</p>
<h3>Husband Sues Concubine for Smoking Opium</h3>
<p>Zhu Jinsheng, a 56-year-old broker at the flour exchange, opened a bean and wheat shop in Maojia Lane, Nanshi, and has a huge fortune. His fourth concubine, Sun Meiyu, is 38 years old this year. Sun Meiyu's father used to work on a ship and only had one daughter, whom he loved like a pearl. She was choosy and missed the days and months, and was unmarried at the age of 28. Her parents died one after another, and she had no relatives in Shanghai. She was all alone, but she still had private savings in her hand. She wanted to shave her head and become a nun, but was persuaded by others. She had a thought of the mortal world, and then she willingly became Zhu's fourth concubine, but it has been ten years now. Recently, I don't know why, the feelings between husband and concubine are unusually broken. So Sun Meiyu sued Zhu Jinsheng for injury in the local court last year, and Zhu also accused Sun of smoking opium. The prosecutor reconciled them in court and settled the case. Unexpectedly, Zhu Jinsheng now accuses his concubine of smoking opium again and requests an investigation. When the order was issued, the defendant did not arrive, so the police arrested Sun Meiyu yesterday. Meiyu cried and scolded the ungrateful man, but she was finally made subject to the law and was detained for inspection.</p>

<p>Failed the First Time, But Still Not Dead</p>
<p>Shen Jinfeng, the daughter of Shen Yao from Taiyangmiao, Zhabei, is 25 years old and still unmarried. She has a good appearance and is a daughter of a small family. Peng Kunzheng, a worker at a nearby cloth factory, coveted her beauty. On the evening of the 18th of this month, he ventured to Jinfeng's bed and strangled her throat with his hands, trying to satisfy his lust. The woman kicked her feet wildly, and Peng knew that it was impossible. Fearing that his wife would find out, he staggered and ran away. Unexpectedly, he was unwilling to give up and went back the next night with a small knife to intimidate and rape her. The woman fell to the ground and shouted, and Peng ran away again. Jinfeng then went to the Fourth District Police Station with her mother to file a complaint. The police arrested Peng, but Peng denied it. As the case was related to obscenity, it was transferred to the local court for trial yesterday.</p>

<p>Both Happened in Zhabei</p>
<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, an unnamed male corpse was found in front of the Tai Mao Timber Shop, opposite the Zhabei Xinmin Road Fire Brigade on Xinmin Road, Zhabei.

<p>Coastal Counties</p>
<h3>Joint Compilation of Patrol Teams to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>The pirates and bandits in the coastal counties of Tong, Ru, Hai, and Qidong outside Wusongkou have been colluding with each other and have become increasingly rampant recently. These counties belong to the fourth district of the Jiangsu Provincial Maritime Public Security Team. However, due to the lack of police force in the fourth district, it is beyond their reach. Hu Puan, director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, in view of this, specially ordered each county to jointly form a large patrol team within two weeks to supplement the police force so that the bandits can be eradicated as soon as possible.</p>

They robbed him of seven yuan in banknotes and three double coins stored in his pockets. Unexpectedly, Mao resisted slightly at the time, and the bandits fired a shot at him, hitting him in the leg. Fortunately, he was not seriously injured. Nearby detectives heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, but the bandits had already fled. They immediately rushed to the police station and sent Mao to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Ma Wenda, Captain of the 7th Detachment of the Shanghai South Security Corps, reported that a resident surnamed Chen, residing outside Xiaonanmen, had received threatening letters demanding a large sum of money in April of this year. The letters specified a location for the money to be dropped off. Therefore, Captain Ma ordered Platoon Leader Jin Shunchang to lead corps members Gu Guo'an and others, all in disguise and armed, to the designated location at around 10 PM on April 21st. They ambushed themselves near the Zhengede School gate outside Xiaonanmen's Xiaozha Bridge. Soon, Li Zhonghua arrived and placed a newspaper on a red wooden object there. Platoon Leader Jin and others, seeing this from behind a bamboo fence, believed Li's actions matched the contents of the threatening letters. They rushed out and ordered him to stop, but Li ignored them and raised his right hand. Corps member Gu, acting in self-defense, fired a shot, wounding Li's right arm. A money pouch (made of blue cloth) he was holding fell to the ground. Li was immediately taken to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. The pouch contained over a hundred copper coins, tied with a string at the top. Captain Ma sealed the pouch and sent it to the Public Security Bureau for instructions.</p>
<p>On the day Li was injured, his wife, Li Wangshi, filed a complaint with the Local Court accusing the Security Corps of shooting and wounding her husband, demanding an investigation. After questioning, the prosecutor deemed the Security Corps a suspect in a homicide and filed charges with the Criminal Court. Judge Wu Zhen conducted a public trial. The Security Corps side recounted the above events and presented four small notebooks of interest, asking for handwriting verification and calling witnesses to clarify the truth. Li claimed that he was collecting money that evening and, while passing by, picked up a newspaper, which aroused the Security Corps' suspicion, leading to the shooting. He also named witnesses. The judge, after hearing the statements, decided that witness testimony was necessary and adjourned the debate for a further hearing.</p>
<p>Yesterday, another hearing was held. At 10 AM, Judge Wu specially opened the third courtroom. The defendants were defended by lawyers Tang Yingsong and Pan Cheng'e. The audience seats were filled, mostly with fellow members of the Security Corps, numbering over a hundred. After the judge took his seat, he first called Jin Shunchang to the stand. (Question:) Was Li Zhonghua's money pouch open or closed? (Answer:) Closed. (Question:) How far were you from Li Zhonghua when you fired? (Answer:) About ten steps. (Question:) Were you and Gu Guo'an the only two present at that time? (Answer:) Yes. The judge then showed him the pouch. (Question:) Is this it? (Answer:) Yes. The judge called Gu Guo'an to the stand. (Question:) Was Li's money pouch rolled up or open? (Answer:) Rolled up. (Question:) How far were you from Li when you fired? (Answer:) About ten steps. (Question:) Did the pouch fall to the ground after the shot was fired? (Answer:) Yes.</p>
<p>Next, Li Zhonghua was questioned: How many Security Corps members were around you when they shot? (Answer:) Six or seven. Two grabbed my left and right hands, and there was another person behind me. The judge said, "If they were holding your hands and shooting, wouldn't the person behind be in danger?" (Answer:) This side... (Question:) How much money does Xu Shuanghui owe you? (Answer:) Five yuan in hui money. (Question:) Do you have a written record? (Answer:) No, although I met Xu that day, I didn't receive the money. (Question:) How much does Wang Mao owe you? (Answer:) Ten yuan, because his mother died, he borrowed it from me. There is a written IOU, with two cents interest per month, two dimes interest. He gave me two dimes in small coins that day. (Question:) How much does Shen Fugen owe you? (Answer:) Also ten yuan. (Question:) When did he borrow it? (Answer:) I don't remember. (Question:) Do you have proof? (Answer:) Yes, the money has been returned. (Question:) When was it returned? (Answer:) Last month when I was in the hospital, my wife went to collect it. (Question:) How much does Huang Ji owe you? (Answer:) Ten yuan, already paid back last month. (Question:) How much does Ji Sheng owe you? (Answer:) Ten yuan, also paid back. He sells used goods and paid me back in small installments. However, Shen Fugen's money was borrowed by his mother-in-law. (Question:) What time did you go to Huang Ji's place? (Answer:) Seven or eight o'clock. Shen Fugen and Ji Sheng, etc., live very close to Huang Ji. (Question:) Did Xu Shuanghui come today? (Answer:) He went to Suzhou.</p>
<p>The judge then summoned witness Huang Ji to testify: I am thirty years old, from Shanghai, living at the south end of Xiao Jiu Hua, working as a hosiery worker. My name is A Yuan, I am not yet married, my surname is Huang. (Question:) How much money did you borrow from Li Zhonghua? (Answer:) Ten yuan, two cents interest. I borrowed it on February 22nd of the 17th year when my mother passed away. I paid interest on March 23rd and cleared the loan on the 28th, his wife came to collect it. I have the IOU, but it's already burned. He came to collect interest around 9 PM on the 23rd of each month because I work during the day and am not home.</p>
<p>Witness Zhu Chenshi, aged forty-one, from Chongming, residing in Xizhou Lane, testified: Shen Fugen is my son-in-law. He borrowed ten yuan from Li, with two dimes interest per month. He borrowed it in the first month of the year before last and paid it back on the 20th of last month. (Question:) Did Li Zhonghua come on April 21st? (Answer:) He came after dinner. I gave him two dimes in small coins, a single eight, etc.</p>
<p>Witness Ji Sheng, aged fifty-one, from Ningbo, residing in Cangqiao, selling used goods, testified: I borrowed ten yuan from Li in March of this year. I paid him one thousand cash in interest that day, and it's already been paid back. (Question:) Did he come to your house on April 21st? (Answer:) Yes, around seven or eight o'clock.</p>
<p>At this point, lawyer Pan stated that the times the witnesses gave for borrowing money did not match Li's testimony. Lawyer Tang then presented the copied names of the four households on the money lending notebook. The judge announced that he would summon more witnesses for a further hearing and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Jiang Huigen's Rice Boat Robbed</h3>
<p>Robbery Occurred at Yeshe Late at Night</p>
<p>Boat Owner and Crew Members Injured</p>
<p>Jiang Huigen, who sells rice by boat, recently purchased one hundred and ninety piculs of white rice from the Zhangjin production area inland, intending to sell it in Shanghai. A few days ago, while sailing on the Nan Huangpu River near Yeshe, it became dark, so he anchored there for the night. Around midnight, two small rowboats suddenly approached, carrying over ten bandits armed with guns, knives, and clubs. They swarmed onto the boat, attempting to rob the stern cabin. Jiang and his crew awoke from their sleep, rushed out on deck, and shouted for help. Jiang was struck on the head with a club by the bandits, breaking his skull and causing him to collapse in extreme pain. One crew member was slashed four or five times. The other crew members, seeing this, were terrified and dared not speak out. The bandits searched the stern cabin and found over seventy silver dollars. They then searched the crew, taking all their silver coins. Not satisfied, they also stole a leather suitcase from the stern cabin. The bandits jumped back into the two small rowboats and fled south in a rush, firing two shots. One shot hit Jiang's boat, creating a hole in the stern. After the bandits left, the boat sailed to Minhang yesterday. The crew took Jiang and the injured crew member to the hospital for treatment. It is said that Jiang's injuries are very serious. One of the crew came to Shanghai to report to rice merchant Hong, and to borrow silver to pass through the Shanghai tax checkpoints and pay duties.</p>

<h3>Fire on Hengtong Road, Zhabei</h3>
<p>Neighbors Affected</p>

<h3>Russian Prisoner Dies of Lung Disease in Prison</h3>
<p>Xiao Dahueba, a Russian national previously arrested by the Hongkou Police and handed over to the Provisional Court, was sentenced to five years for stealing a pistol and five rounds of ammunition from a Westerner and sent to the Western Prison. Recently, Xiao fell ill with lung disease and died in prison the day before yesterday. The body was taken to the Forensic Examination Center on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Xu Mei, a prosecutor assigned by the Special District Court, visited the examination center to examine the body. After confirming the identity of the body and briefly questioning the Western deputy head, and due to the lack of family members, he instructed that the body be handed over to the Pushan Burial Society for encoffining and burial.</p>
<h3>Peddler Dies En Route</h3>
<p>Zhang Asan, a peddler from Yixing, collapsed on the ground in the Xiaocai market on Avenue Edouard VII and Xinzha Road on the morning of the day before yesterday. A police officer found him and hired a car to take him to the hospital, but he died en route. His body was taken to the forensic examination center on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the incident was reported to the Special District Local Court, which dispatched prosecutor Xu to the center to examine the body and confirm that he died of illness. He instructed the deceased's cousin, Shi Fengchun, to sign a guarantee and claim the body for encoffining and burial.</p>
<h3>British Man Beidi Missing</h3>
<p>Disappeared When the Ship Entered Hong Kong</p>
<p>According to the Wenhui Bao, Beidi, a British accountant at HSBC, took leave to return to England and boarded the Russian liner "Empress" on the 7th of this month bound for Vancouver. This city has just received a telegram from Canada stating that Beidi suddenly went missing when the ship entered Hong Kong. The incident occurred between 2:00 AM and 6:00 AM. The reason is unknown. It is reported that Mr. Beidi has suffered from insomnia for some time. This tragic death was likely due to this condition. According to HSBC personnel, Mr. Beidi's attitude was often very dejected. However, this return to his home country was a routine leave and not an advance leave. The accounts are in order, and his personal finances are quite sufficient.</p>
<h3>Reunion Ends in Bloodshed</h3>
<p>Wang Chengzong Advocates Goodwill</p>
<p>Wang Ahu Repeatedly Provokes</p>
<p>Wang Chengzong, a 27-year-old man from Ningbo, resides at No. 2 Yongkangli, near the Shanghai Military Camp in the South City. Wang Ahu, a fellow townsman and coppersmith formerly employed with Wang at the Qiuxin Factory, and Shi Ninghai, from Zhenhai, were previously on very good terms with Chengzong. However, they successively left the factory. After leaving the factory, Ahu found work at another factory, while Shi remained unemployed. Around 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, Chengzong went out shopping and happened to meet Ahu and Shi. He immediately invited them back to his home for a gathering. After a short time, everyone became intoxicated. They were about to eat when Chengzong realized that he had not prepared enough food because he had not anticipated guests. Therefore, he said that since he had not cooked enough rice, everyone might as well contribute one yuan so that they could order some dishes, rice, and wine from outside to ensure they were all satisfied. He was about to take out the money when Ahu said he hadn't brought any money. Seeing this situation, Chengzong immediately declined and said that since Ahu had been unemployed for some time and was having financial difficulties, and he was only here for a casual drink, there was no reason for them to spend any money. He would take care of buying the necessary dishes, rice, and wine himself. Unexpectedly, Ahu suddenly pulled out a yuan from his pocket and said that it wasn't that he wasn't willing to contribute, but that he was already full. Seeing this, Shi criticized him for saying he hadn't brought any money when he clearly did, and that he was acting like a "half-wit." Ahu was enraged and immediately threw a stool, but fortunately Chengzong was quick enough to catch it, preventing it from hitting him. Chengzong tried to mediate, and Ahu reluctantly left. After a while, Ahu came back again, but Chengzong suspected that he had evil intentions. He immediately rushed forward and hugged Ahu. While hugging him, he noticed a metal bar on his person, which he took him to a nearby tea house and repeatedly tried to persuade him. Only then did Ahu calm down and leave. Around 10:00 PM, Ahu came again. Chengzong didn't suspect anything else, but to his surprise, while Shi was unprepared, Ahu suddenly took out a very sharp triangular dagger from his pocket and stabbed Shi violently in the left side of his waist, then ran away at full speed. After being injured, Shi bled profusely and collapsed to the ground, unconscious. Chengzong took him to the hospital for treatment. On the way home, he encountered Ahu again. Chengzong thought that Ahu's behavior was too heartless and immediately grabbed him and reported him to He Ziming and Yin Wanyou, the patrol officers of the 1st Precinct of the 1st District, who took him back to the station. The station chief filed a report on the case and, after a preliminary hearing, transferred the case to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation on the grounds of intentional injury.</p>

<h3>Verdict on Automobile Accident Injuring a Child</h3>
<p>Gu Genda, a chauffeur, was driving to Avenue Belles in the French Concession on the morning of the 16th of this month when, due to his negligence, he struck and killed six-year-old Pan Liangfa, son of Pan Ronglin from Ningbo, who resided on that road. These details have been reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, the police sent Gu to the French Concession Court for investigation. First, the head of the vehicle management department reported the circumstances to the court, followed by the victim's family, who described the accident and requested justice. Gu Genda testified that he was driving when the child suddenly rushed out from the side of the road, making it impossible for him to brake in time. He pleaded for leniency. The Chinese and Western judges fined Gu five yuan and ordered him to pay 400 yuan in compensation to the plaintiff for losses.</p>

<h3>Remembering a Strange Case in Liyang Prison · Zhuang Yan</h3>
<p>This case occurred last spring. It has been more than ten months since then. It seems there is nothing to record. However, it is still under appeal. The National Supreme Court has scheduled to hear this case in August of this year. Therefore, this draft is still a news item.</p>
<p>Wang Yi, a man from Jiangning, was working at the Public Security Bureau in Nandou, Liyang. He was young and rather foolish. He was very strict with gambling and smoking within his jurisdiction. The local gamblers deeply resented him. One night in February of last year, during the Lunar New Year, Wang and his colleague Huang Fan were drinking in a city tower. Slightly drunk, they were suddenly approached by a breathless person who reported that someone was gambling at a house in the southern countryside. Wang and others ordered him to lead the way to arrest them, and sent Fan back to the bureau to report and gather reinforcements. They had just left the restaurant when the reporter disappeared without a trace. It was late at night. Everything was silent. The location was remote. It was rumored to be haunted. Huang saw that the reporter had disappeared in the blink of an eye. The incident was bizarre and he felt quite timid. Wang, however, was young and headstrong and insisted that there was nothing to fear. So they proceeded together. After walking dozens of steps, they suddenly saw a child standing in front of a pancake shop on the side of the street. In the dim light, his face was red as a jujube, his eyes were bright. Wang shouted to ask who he was. The child did not answer. Huang saw that the door of the pancake shop was closed, but the child was closely guarding the side of the cold oven. He was suspicious and wanted to arrest and search him. The child ran wildly. Wang and Huang chased after him. They ran quickly along a pond. In the blink of an eye, the child's trace was lost again. Wang and Huang were looking at each other in astonishment when they suddenly heard a banging sound from a small thatched hut beside the mulberry tree. Wang and others went forward to investigate. Indeed, they saw several people gambling at pai gow in the house. Huang had a handgun with him, so he gave it to Wang, ordering him to guard the door while he went inside to make the arrests. One of the gamblers, surnamed Zhu, happened to be standing near the door, thinking he could escape. He quickly opened the door and ran out. In the dark, he collided with Wang. Wang was knocked to the ground. During the scuffle, the handgun went off accidentally. The bullet hit Zhu in the back of the head. Zhu ran madly, about ten steps, and then died of his injuries. Afterwards, after interrogation by the Liyang County Government, he was sentenced to death for murder. Those who heard this thought it was an injustice. Wang then appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. The sentence was changed to life imprisonment. Wang was still not exempt from the murder charge. He was unwilling and appealed to the Supreme Court again.</p>
<p>Commentators said that Wang and Zhu had no prior grudge. Why did this unfortunate incident occur? Moreover, firing a gun in the dark, no matter what, would not be so accurate. They pointed to the sudden appearance and disappearance of the reporter and the pancake shop child as evidence that he encountered ghosts, and lamented it as a previous life's karma.</p>
<h3>A Brief Account of the Music Concert at the Anglo-Chinese Girls' School by Huang Jiping</h3>
<p>The summer vacation has arrived. The examinations at various schools have concluded. Entertainment gatherings, music concerts, and the like are emerging in response. These are, without exception, expressions of farewell to graduating students. For the students still in school, it is an opportunity to relax and refresh their minds after a term of diligent effort. These two meanings are both present. The various schools in the city are currently holding such events one after another, resembling a harmonious chorus.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Chinese Girls' School also held a music concert the night before last (the 21st). The school has long enjoyed a high reputation in Shanghai. I had wanted to visit it for some time. Fortunately, I had the opportunity, so I would not miss it. I took a car and arrived after half an hour. Entering the school gate, I passed through a winding path shaded by dense trees. The Western-style building could be faintly seen in the distance. The short grass was like a carpet, and the gardens were lush, creating a delightful scene. In an instant, all the guests arrived, mostly young ladies. Entering the concert hall, it became silent and orderly, not often seen in ordinary gatherings. The opening was at eight o'clock, and the program proceeded section by section, up to the sixteenth section. There were chorus performances and solo performances by students from various grades, as well as piano solos and ensembles. Except for one or two sections that used musical instruments, all were vocal performances, and nine out of ten were Western songs. Only "Fengyang Flower Drum" and "Banqiao Daoqing" were national treasures, but their tunes seemed to have already been Westernized. Several elders among the guests were utterly baffled, as if they were in a Western theater. No wonder they lost interest. Two sections were "Rhythmic Orchestra" and "Rhythmic Orchestra and Chorus," and these two sections were very exciting. The instruments used included bells, drums, wooden fish, copper bells, piano, and violin, combined for playing. It was truly a blend of Chinese and Western elements, earning much applause. Ms. Yin Ziqing's (transliteration) piano solo showed extremely skilled fingering. Ms. Xiao Qiwei's (transliteration) solo singing had a melodious and ethereal tone, being the most outstanding. Overall, this music concert was quite satisfactory, but it was a pity that the songs leaned towards Western lyrics and music, with more singing and less instrumental music, inevitably making it somewhat imperfect.</p>
<p>At least two hundred people appeared on stage during the music concert, wearing simple silk dresses, with neat attire. This would be difficult to achieve in ordinary, common schools. However, all the ladies were not very strong, revealing a "delicate and frail" appearance everywhere. Beautiful, yes, but what about their health? Furthermore, among these many ladies, more than a dozen were not wearing corsets. This陋習 [a bad habit] that hinders women's physical development has become a common ailment of Chinese women. The matter is of great importance to the nation's health. Western women consider developed breasts to be a sign of health, while Chinese women consider tight breasts to be beautiful. The misconception is deeply ingrained, and liberation is not easy. It is hoped that enlightened women will vigorously advocate and practice "freeing the breasts" to cultivate a "healthy and beautiful" physique.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Performance at the Luhe Amateur Opera Troupe by an Old Hand</h3>
<p>The nineteenth day of the month was the seventieth birthday of Mr. Xu Guqing. Previously, Mr. Xu's relatives and friends in Shanghai had planned to initiate a celebration to offer him birthday congratulations. However, Mr. Xu, always preferring tranquility, did not want to be ostentatious and strongly opposed the proposal, which was then abandoned. But the Luhe Amateur Opera Troupe, represented by Mr. Xie Baosheng and Mr. Hong Ziyi, felt that Mr. Xu had borne important social responsibilities throughout his life and that his rare seventieth birthday should not pass without any expression. Therefore, they gathered the troupe members at the Luhe Amateur Opera Troupe and held a dress rehearsal for one day to express their public congratulations. On that day, there were twelve plays in the program. I arrived after dinner and only saw four acts. The following is a brief record: First, "Red Phoenix Rejoices." It did not include the scene of beating the procuress. Mr. Rong Boming played Jin Yunu, depicting her being of marriageable age and meeting a talented young man, whom she did not want to let go of easily. His performance was neither too close nor too distant, and every frown and smile perfectly suited the role of a young maiden. Xie Baosheng played Jin Song, speaking eloquently and practicing his stage skills diligently. Next, Dai Guirong performed "Zhuliang Village," but only half an act. Although Mr. Dai's voice was not very high, his phrasing and cadences were quite agile, showing his skill. The third was "The Three Versions of the Iron Rooster." Xie Wenyuan played Zhang Jiaxiang, Sun Lanting played Xiang Rong, Liu Congxia played Tie Jinchi, and Fang Shanzhen and Wang Shensheng played the yamen runners. The cast was well-matched, making it a perfect performance. Mr. Xie is very young and diligently trains in martial arts on a regular basis. Whenever he performs in martial plays, he truly gives the impression of one brave man causing ten thousand to retreat. In terms of his stage skills, he is not inferior to Gai Wu. Mr. Sun is skilled in both civil and martial roles, and he is especially good at impersonating a beggar picking up money. Whether it is a young woman, a painted face, or an ugly character, none are beyond his ability. He can be called a theater expert. Mr. Liu is skilled in playing the painted face, and his singing of the "Liushui Ban" section in this play was both humorous and extremely pleasant to listen to. Mr. Fang and Mr. Wang both had large bellies. When the two argued, they spoke in their not-very-pure Shaoxing dialect, causing the entire audience to laugh heartily. The last play was "The Imperial Stele Pavilion." Sun Junqing played Wang Youdao, and He Zhiying played Meng Yuehua. Both Mr. Sun and Mr. He looked good in their costumes. Sun imitated Ma Lianliang, which was quite similar, but his elegant appearance surpassed Lianliang's. By the time this play was performed, the clock had struck twelve. Without waiting for the play to finish, I hurriedly went home. This is a special written record.</p>
<p>Short News: Cheng Yanqiu, known as the "Mist Master of Jade Frost," performed a series of plays during his engagement at a wealthy household in Shenyang, including "Cosmic Edge," "Offering at the Pagoda," "Jade Hall Spring," "Rambling with the Wind," and "The Double Meeting of Odd and Even." He was hailed as the "Iron Voice" at the time. It was heard that he also performed "The Golden Stage" with Zhang Xueliang's third younger brother. Zhang played Yi Li, and Cheng cross-dressed as an old man, which was quite a good performance. After the performance, he planned to return to Beijing immediately, but officials and merchants in Harbin telegraphed Yan Zepu and Zhang Xueming, requesting him to go to Harbin to perform in charity performances for the Shaanxi disaster relief fund. Yu Shuang readily agreed and arrived in Harbin on the ninth. More than two hundred officials and merchants went to the station to welcome him. He was approved to perform at the Da Dingyang Cinema on the tenth. The first night was "The Jade Hairpin," the second night was "Mandarin Duck Tomb," and the third night was "The Carefree Cudgel." After completing the charity performances, he continued to perform commercial plays for several days. The ticket prices were 100 yuan for a box and 10 yuan for a seat. All five days' tickets were sold out. It is estimated that he will return to Beijing around the 20th. Currently, someone from Dalian has entrusted Mr. Chen to invite him, but he has declined. Because a certain Shanghai stage invited him very strongly, Qiu asked if he might need to go south to meet the people of Shanghai again. (Beijing)</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (219) by Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 12: Farewell Banquet, Parting Feast, Plucking Flowers to Keep a Pretty Shadow, Fine Garden Gathering, Tea Tasting to View Beautiful Figures</p>
<p>Friends who often frequent houses of pleasure have always had a certain feeling when a beautiful, pretty, and young girl is taken away by a rich man and housed in a golden mansion. It's as if a dazzling flower that everyone could admire has now been dug up by one person and become his personal potted plant. At the very least, they will say that he is a bit selfish, and those filled with sourness will even recite something like, "Once you enter the gate of a noble family, it's as deep as the sea, from then on, Xiao Lang is a stranger." But if you think about it, they don't want her to marry, yet they want her to forever be mired in the dust, without any power to rescue her, only to be available for them to buy smiles and pursue pleasure at any time. Isn't this also selfish? And this selfishness delays their entire lives. This sin is actually greater. Zuo Shichen at that time really hoped that Ruiyun would marry a good man who would be faithful to her. He asked when she would be leaving the hospital. A Jin replied, "According to Mr. Sun from the pawnshop, it will probably be around the twentieth. This young Master Zhang doesn't live in a small private house in Shanghai. He lives in a big mansion. Their big mansion is in Suzhou. They plan to hire a first-class official boat and dock it at Guanyinge Pier. Then, they will pick up A Nv in a carriage. It's like some big families in the countryside when they have a wedding, don't they also pick up the bride in a boat?" Then, they will use a small steamer to tow it back to Suzhou. Young Master Zhang also has an old lady. Of course, they have to kowtow to the old lady." She added with a smile, "Kowtowing is not for nothing. Naturally, the old lady will also give a greeting gift." Ruiyun said, "I don't want to kowtow. I don't want any greeting gift." Zuo Shichen said, "It shouldn't be said like that. Chinese etiquette dictates that you should kowtow to your elders. Not to mention you are going to be a concubine, even if you are a wife, you have to kowtow to the old lady." Zuo Shichen then asked, "So she is going alone? No one is accompanying her?" A Jin said, "This matter has not been decided yet. A Nv wants me to go. I am a little reluctant to let her leave. We are always together for three or four days. We don't leave each other for a day. We almost sleep in the same bed." Saying that, A Jin's throat became a little choked. Ruiyun's head was also gradually lowering towards the big vegetable basin, afraid that this little girl who never showed weakness would also have red eyes. A Jin continued, "Anyway, my next engagement is originally for entertainment. Although Big Aunt is trying her best to keep me, but A Nv is not there, I don't want to be there either. I think Young Master Zhang will agree. I will accompany A Nv to his big mansion. It's easy to talk to Big Aunt. It doesn't cost her anything. But I will only accompany her for a week at most. Then I will leave. People from our house of pleasure going to other people's mansions, people always feel a little unhappy in their hearts. I am very tactful."</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Money Market: Interest Rates Rise Consistently</h3>
<p>Market Overview: The demand for silver dollars is high due to various reasons, and the amount of silver in circulation in Shanghai is limited, except for the cash reserve for banknotes. It is difficult to meet the high demand, so banks are allocating excess funds to foreign firms. The market is actively purchasing banknotes to redeem silver, so issuing banks are actively buying silver dollars. This competition has led to the current tight market situation.</p>
<p>Interest Rates: "Silver Interest Rates" rose sharply due to strong market demand for banknotes. The supply in the market increased, so the interest rate fell slightly by about 0.1% in the afternoon, to 72.375 per thousand. In the afternoon, it was heard that the demand was still strong and there was a large shortage, so the interest rate rose again to 72.425 per thousand, a further increase of 0.05% compared to the early market, indicating the tightness of the market. The "Silver Discount Rate" was 1.2% in the early market and 1.4% in the afternoon, also showing strength. Bank interest rates were also quoted at 0.5%, but the market price for "fraudulent" [lit. "watered"] checks was as high as 1.12-1.23%.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: Small Jiangnan silver coins were 63.5 per thousand in the early market and 63.7 per thousand in the afternoon. Transactions were made for 1,500角 [a unit of currency] in the early market and 3,000角 in the afternoon. Wide-rimmed coins were 60.01375 per thousand in the early market and 60.0325 per thousand in the afternoon. Transactions were made for 150,000角 in the early market and 105,000角 in the afternoon. Copper coins increased by 5,000文 [another unit of currency] and exceeded 400,000文, reaching 401,000文.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: Yesterday was Monday, so banks were busy with settlements. Local Chinese banks settled over 3.1 million in check payments, foreign banks settled 2.12 million, special collections amounted to over 1.5 million, settlements totaled over 2 million, loans totaled 1 million, and various cargo, tax, miscellaneous, telegraph, and deposit payments totaled around 11 million. 800,000 were deposited into warehouses, and 500,000 were withdrawn. The Japanese bank settled over 5.78 million in check payments and deposited 1 million into warehouses. Money shops and silver firms settled over 43 million in silver notes and over 4.89 million in "fraudulent" [lit. "watered"] checks. Incoming remittances totaled over 1 million, and cash settlements totaled over 1 million. "Foreign Dollars" settled 1.63 million in check payments in the early market and 1.323 million in the afternoon. Only 25,000 banknotes were settled in the afternoon. In the early market, 45,000 new Zhongshan silver dollars were settled. In the early market, 225,000 banknotes were settled outside the exchange; in the afternoon, 124,000 were settled. 180,000 silver dollars were settled in the early market, and 230,000 were settled in the afternoon. Bank transactions totaled 700,000 in the early market and 750,000 in the afternoon. Foreign banks' receipts and disbursements with foreign firms totaled 2.78 million. Banknote inflows and outflows totaled over 1 million. Money shops' and silver firms' settlements totaled over 7.3 million in silver notes and 3.2 million in "fraudulent" [lit. "watered"] foreign currency. Loaned silver dollars totaled over 2.1 million. Small money shops' transactions totaled over 600,000.</p>
<h3>Government Treasury Releases Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>The money industry's public treasury previously purchased and stored silver dollars when the interest rates were low, totaling nearly 1 million. It is now heard that interest rates have soared and the market needs them urgently, so they have released the silver dollars in the past two days, totaling 6-700,000.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollars Have Wide Uses</h3>
<p>Yesterday, over 800,000 silver dollars were shipped to the north, 800,000 to Hankou, over 400,000 to inland areas, 6-700,000 to Zhilian [Zhili and Fengtian], 600,000 to Shantou and Xiamen, and 300,000 new Guangdong silver dollars. In addition, it is heard that the military needs 1.5 million to be shipped to Fengtian. Therefore, the total amount shipped out yesterday was as high as 4-5 million. Shanghai's silver dollars have been greatly depleted, and the source is scarce. Yesterday, there were only over 300,000 silver dollars, and 400,000 were collected in Shanghai. If this continues, the interest rate is likely to continue to soar.</p>
<h3>Gold Market: Speculation Hides Reversal</h3>
<p>Banks claim to have spot silver</p>
<p>Price dropped 4 taels and 5 qian</p>
<p>Fluctuations were unsteady and unstable. Yesterday, the gold market was extremely chaotic and the changes were indescribable. Prices rose sharply in the morning and weakened in the afternoon, then strengthened and weakened again. There were fluctuations of 3-4 taels or 5-6 taels at times, with no certainty. In the end, the prices trended downwards, almost reversing. There were a total of 11-12 taels of fluctuations in the market. Traders' minds were confused, generally due to the control of the atmosphere. Exchange rates sometimes tightened and sometimes weakened, and the listed prices had already been reduced by one and a half notches. Bank receipts and payments were unstable. Brokers' buying and selling was active, but the quantities were limited. Fuchang, Hengxing, and Tianyuyong had mostly sold, while Zhifengyong and Yuanmaoyong had mostly bought. The market opened high in the early market, probably because the price of large silver bars had fallen. Afterwards, there were hidden speculations, and the foreign exchange rate had once loosened, but then strengthened again. The trend of the various exchange rates was quite good. Suddenly, the price soared to a peak of 619 taels, breaking the record again and again. The market was unstoppable. Due to the many sellers, there was a rapid retreat, and the price fell sharply by 6-7 taels. In the afternoon market, various firms still did not have large inflows or outflows. Xiangyu and Fuchang bought, while Yuanmaoyong and Zhifengyong sold. Initially, the market was stable, but then the waves became big and the situation worsened. It was said that a certain bank intended to sell spot silver, which caused panic, and the exchange rate was also weak. The price suddenly fell by 7-8 taels, breaking the 610 tael mark. Afterwards, the price was between 608 taels.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was a peak of 19 taels for spot silver. The price of large silver bars fell by 16/5 taels, and the price of silver was 1/2 lower. The opening price for August was 616.5 taels, an increase of 4 taels. The gross price sometimes reached 2 taels higher or lower. However, the foreign exchange rate seemed weak, and there were many sellers on the trading floor. The initial announcement was 15 taels. Although the listed price was reduced by 0.375, with US dollars decreasing by 0.075, and Japanese yen increasing by 0.0275, it was not good. Because Taixing, Hengxing, and Tianyuyong were competing to sell, the price immediately dropped by over 2 taels, to 12.5 taels. The domestic initial price was flat. Banks mutually traded next month's pounds at 5 shillings 6.875 pence. Later, Mitsui bought at 5 shillings 7.5 pence, and the Hua Bank traded US dollars for August at 36 yuan. Afterwards, retail investors bought, and the exchange rate strengthened, so the price gradually rose, jumping by 6 taels, reaching 19 taels at 10:30. However, due to the continued selling, the price dropped by over 6 taels, to 12.5 taels at around 11:00. After half an hour, the price was pulled up by 4 taels, because those who had sold short were covering their positions, returning to 16.7-8 taels. The market was chaotic. Hengxing continued to sell, causing a sharp drop of 5 taels. At noon, the price was 11.8-9 taels. The market closed at 12.6 taels. The announced price was changed to 677.4 taels, a decrease of about 60 taels. The afternoon price decreased by about 65 taels.</p>
<p>The spot silver market collapsed. The opening price in the afternoon was 13.8 taels, an increase of 1.2 taels. But the goods had already been priced high. Then there was a fluctuation of 1 tael up and down, and Zhifengyong sold, so the price moved downwards. At 2:30, the price was 11.3-4 taels. Banks mutually traded British pounds for July at 5 shillings 9.375 pence. There was a profit for selling October pounds at 6 shillings 0.625 pence. After entering the market, the Hua Bank had sold August US dollars at 5 shillings 8.75 pence. The market situation seemed tight, and Fuchang bought on the trading floor, so the price rose to 15.5 taels at 3:00. Later, news spread that a certain bank was selling spot goods, so the market sentiment turned negative, and everyone sold, causing the atmosphere to worsen and the waves to become turbulent. The price fell sharply by 7-8 taels. After 3:30, the 610 tael mark had been broken. After 4:00, the price finally fell to 607 taels. However, there was a fluctuation of 1-2 taels. The exchange rate also declined. Near-term British pounds could be settled at 6 shillings, and long-term pounds at 6 shillings 1.25 pence. Near-term East Asian exchange was settled at 1.36 taels, but transactions were not smooth. The market closed at 4:30 at 608 taels. Hengxing and others bought slightly, a decrease of 4.5 taels compared to last Saturday. The maximum price during the day was 19 taels, and the minimum price was 7 taels, a difference of 12 taels. The goods opened at 16 taels in the morning and closed at 13.5 taels at noon. The afternoon market closed at 7.5 taels, with the announced price still decreasing by 63-4 taels to 70 taels. The logged prices for July were 11 taels and for August 13 taels, with a water supplement of 11 taels in the afternoon and 6 taels.</p>
<p>Inflows and outflows were uneven, and the quantities were mediocre. Zhifengyong, Yuanxingyong, Yuanmaoyong, and Shunli were mostly buying. Hengxing, Fuchang, Taixing, Tianyuyong, Yuancheng Yong, and Dadecheng were mostly selling. In the afternoon, Xiangyu, Fuchang, and Fuyu bought, while Yu Da, Hengxing, Dadecheng, and Yuantai had inflows and outflows. Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yuancheng, and Houkangyong all sold. The inflows and outflows for speculators were unstable. The Dalian gang traded about 2,000 items in the morning, with inflows and outflows balancing each other. In the afternoon, only about 7-800 items were traded, and the market was still balanced. The Guangdong gang had sold 1,000-odd items and bought a few hundred items.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: Apparently Tight, Secretly Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed foreign exchange rates all decreased by one and a half notches, due to the low silver market prices the day before. British pounds decreased by 0.375, to 1 shilling 5.375 pence; US dollars decreased by 0.075, to 35.125 yuan; Indian rupees decreased by 2 yuan, to 97.5 rupees; German marks decreased by 3 yuan, to 147.5 marks; French francs decreased by 19 yuan, to 896 yuan; Dutch guilders decreased by 1.75 yuan, to 87.5 guilders; Singapore dollars increased by 3.25, to 160 yuan; Japanese yen increased by 0.0275, to 1.405 yuan; Hong Kong dollars remained at 85 yuan. As for the banks' internal rates, they were initially strong, then weakened once, and then strengthened again. They were tight in the afternoon and then weakened again, generally fluctuating with the gold market. The gold market was volatile, and the final price was weak. The 610 tael mark had been broken. Overall, the atmosphere was strange, and the market was unsettled. In the end, the British pound increased by 0.01875 compared to last Saturday, the US dollar increased by 0.0375, and the Japanese yen decreased by 0.015, indicating an apparent tightness but a secret looseness. Foreign firms settled a small amount, but there were no large settlements. Chinese firms had uneven inflows and outflows, and the banks' appetite was not good. Banks such as Youli and Dongya sold, and Hengxing bought some. Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Maixing Guangdong all bought. Banks mutually traded 7-80,000 pounds and traded 100,000 US dollars. Chinese firms settled over 100,000 yuan, and Sumitomo sold. Japanese yen were sold by Japanese firms in the near term and far term for tens of thousands of yuan, and Mitsui bought. The market sentiment seemed to be reversing.</p>

<h3>Travels in Southeast Asia (34) Linghua</h3>
<p>April 1st. A friend invited me to see a Javanese opera. Matters of the world, thought and reality, often differ greatly. The Java in my heart is as different from the Javanese I saw as heaven is from earth. Because my lifelong principle is to enjoy beautiful flowers, a full moon, and long life. Sweet dew descends. A sweet spring emerges. A phoenix appears. A unicorn roams. Therefore, I strictly adhere to Shao Kangjie's words: "Never do a frowning thing in my life. There should be no one who grinds their teeth at me in the world." A frowning thing is what is commonly called a troublesome thing. In China, I have repeatedly heard that Java is very troublesome, so I am unwilling to set foot there. I am unwilling to see its people. I even have troublesome things, and I don't want to hear its name. This is my lifelong attitude and also the state of the new world I want to create in the future. Even in this place, there are friends who repeatedly say that Java is better than the British colony. There is a Lin Chao, who was born in Java and studied at Tsinghua School in Beijing and ran a telegraph and communications agency in Shanghai. In the past, he translated the Kedai Tongxue An [a case study] into Dutch and spread it in the Dutch colony. He said: "In Dutch Java, no Chinese pull rickshaws. They are all merchants. Their status is equal to that of Westerners. For example, in British colonies, it is not possible for Chinese to hold dances because Westerners believe that the Chinese are not of equal status. But in the Dutch colony, there is great freedom. In all theaters, there are few Chinese in the third-class seats, so the status of Chinese is very high. In British colonies, most of the Chinese are workers, and the poor are everywhere. Therefore, the status of Chinese is greatly affected. The matter of Chinese pulling rickshaws in Dutch colonies was promoted by the press to abolish it in order to fight for the dignity of the Chinese."</p>
<p>The Java in my heart is that the Dutch government is an inhumane government, and the land of Java must be dirty and unbearable. The Javanese should also be poor, lowly, ugly, and all men. Therefore, I am unwilling to set foot there. I am unwilling to see its people. Now, I see that there is a Javanese opera here. The ticket prices are 3 yuan for first class and 1.5 yuan for second class. I thought that this kind of opera should be compared to monkey opera. Why is it so expensive? Because of Mr. Lin's advocacy, I tried it out. Javanese music is quite beautiful. The layout is also elegant. The dancing women are of a race between Westerners and Chinese. They are particularly beautiful, elegant, healthy, generous. The layout of Javanese scenery is rich, magnificent, clean. I feel like there is another world. It seems to be above the British colony. As for the performance, in short, all male activities are nothing more than fighting. I have watched all kinds of dramas. All male performances are always about killing. So I dare to say that without more than half the number of women, the Great Harmony cannot be created. Males are a dangerous element in the age of Great Harmony. Males dare not create, and there is no hope for humanity. Marx only knows about bread. He doesn't know if the seven kingdoms of Han, the eight kings of Jin, and the Tang Taizong father and son brothers kill each other. The Ming Jianwen and Chengzu uncles and nephews killed each other. Why were they for this bread? It's for vanity and bad systems. I see the beauty of Javanese women, but once a male is added, it is nothing more than holding knives and killing each other, raping women. This is the same old trick of males throughout the ages. I dare to conclude that judging males as male bandits. Those who are滔滔 [violent and arrogant] are all non-bandits. I cannot help but think of the land of the Queen Mother of the West and the land of daughters in Jinghua Yuan. According to the Yuan Dynasty history, Java was originally a country of women during the Yuan Dynasty. It paid tribute together with the country of Luohu. Now, I see that its women are indeed worth seeing. Both men and women are particularly beautiful because they are mixed with Western races. In the future, without the mixing of world races, no new, superior, beautiful races can be born. A friend said that after the mixing of Filipino races, the new races born are good-looking and intelligent. This is the third point of the six points of the new Great Harmony in my Dongfang Da Tong Xue An [Great Harmony]. After this visit to the Javanese opera, I realized that many things cannot be relied upon in thought. Sometimes the opposite is quite ridiculous.</p>
<p>Performing Javanese stories. I cannot understand the language. However, the singing and expressions can be seen. This Javanese orchestra will also return to Java soon. What they sang was a song of farewell, which was very sad. Regardless of race, birth, death, separation, joy, anger, sorrow, and joy, there is always empathy. This is why the Great Harmony can be achieved. Even immortals and Buddhas transcend the world, but they cannot leave this. The human world and the heavenly world are both sentient beings, so also from this, they become the realm of gods, immortals, and Buddhas.</p>

However, the overall market sentiment was good, and buying pressure dominated. The opening prices in the morning all jumped significantly.

The fluctuations between different sectors were relatively moderate. As a result, Customs and Reorganization Bonds futures each rose by 1.34 yuan, Readjustment Bonds for June delivery rose by 1.7 yuan, while others had mixed gains and losses, with the amounts only around half a yuan.</p>

<h3>Further Deterioration of the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Japanese Yarn Prices Plummeting, Talk of Shipping to Shanghai Prevails</p>
<p>Strong Pressure from Short Sellers, No Hope for a Turnaround in the Near Future</p>
<p>The yarn market is experiencing a severe downturn, with prices of Three Goods Yarn (三品紗) plummeting due to the weakness of American cotton and the ongoing warfare. Actual sales are sluggish. Bullish investors, seeing the unfavorable environment, have no choice but to reluctantly close out their positions. Sellers, on the other hand, are taking advantage of the situation to exert pressure, further exacerbating the decline. The price of Three Goods Yarn this month has fallen to 102 yuan. According to the current exchange rate, this is equivalent to about 143 or 144 taels in eastern exchange, plus 21 taels for shipping to Shanghai, totaling about 165 or 166 taels. Therefore, there is much talk in the market of shipping Japanese yarn to Shanghai. Most of the major players in the local market are short sellers, further pressuring the market, making a turnaround difficult in the short term.</p>
<p>The price of standard yarn has dropped by more than two taels. Before the public bid, with the weakness of foreign cotton, the market was relatively flat, with prices for each month slightly down by three to four qian. In the second and third rounds, with the price of Three Goods Yarn falling by four to five yuan, and with discouraged sentiment, the market fell again. As a result, the prices for each month all fell by five, seven, or eight qian to one tael. In the afternoon, the price of Three Goods Yarn reached a low of 102 yuan, causing panic in the market. Retail investors closed out their positions. Two major bullish investors closed out their positions, with Yichengchang accounting for 1,200 bales. Most of the buying was by retail investors. Near-term contracts fell by seven qian, while far-term contracts fell by one tael and four qian, five qian, seven qian, and nine qian. The total turnover for the day was 27,400 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Closing Price Change Account Balance September 155.7 Down 0.27 25,950</p>
<p>June 154.0 Down 0.12-0.16 700 October 156.6 Down 0.23 25,600</p>
<p>July 154.0 Down 0.24 21,300 November 156.9 Down 0.24 18,350</p>
<p>August 154.9 Down 0.24 28,200</p>
<p>Current Demand is Just Passable. The current sales of yarn are still good. It is found that the whole day each gang buy go statistics 1,550 bales, inside the same industry enter 725 bales, the market falls by two and a half qian to seven and a half qian. Among the guest gangs, Sichuan bought the most, accounting for 390 bales. In addition, Guangdong 325 bales, Qinhuangdao 85 bales, Gaoyang 30 bales, Tianjin 80 bales, Shantou 185 bales, Niuzhuang 40 bales, the interior 240 bales, Hankou 40 bales, miscellaneous gangs 70 bales, etc.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices are Falling Sharply</h3>
<p>Hankou Merchants are Reportedly Purchasing Spot Goods in Shanghai. The cotton market appears to be slightly stronger than the yarn market, but it is still weak. American cotton prices are falling again, and the yarn market is plummeting. Sentiment is weak and depressed, and selling pressure is strong. However, Hankou merchants are calm and have not taken any significant action. According to some sources, good-quality goods are scarce in Hankou, and they are reportedly purchasing spot goods in Shanghai. Therefore, the cotton market is more expensive than the yarn market. However, the situation with American cotton is unfavorable, and it is difficult to predict the future.</p>
<p>Far-Term Hankou Standard Cotton is Falling Sharply by Six Qian or More. The Hankou Standard Cotton market opened with prices down by one to three qian across all months due to American cotton prices falling by more than 30 points. In the afternoon, with the sharp decline in the yarn market, sentiment weakened further, and many bullish investors closed out their positions, exacerbating the decline. Prices fell by one and a half to four qian across all months. The total turnover for the day was 47,000 dan. The closing prices for Hankou Standard Cotton are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Closing Price Change Account Balance August 36.80 Down 0.60 82,000</p>
<p>June 35.90 Down 0.25 38,600 October 36.20 Down 0.65 72,000</p>
<p>July 36.30 Down 0.55 66,400 November 36.15 Down 0.60 63,600</p>
<p>Factory Demand Remains Stagnant. The current transaction of cotton is quite light, each factory attitude is extremely still, has no any significant movement, in the industry enter American kind of cotton 47.5 taels 48.5 taels, total 500 pieces, the warehouse hands over.</p>

<h3>The Sharp Decline of Three Goods Yarn and its Impact on Exports to China</h3>
<p>The price of Japanese Three Goods Yarn has been gradually declining since last year, but the decline has intensified in the past month, nearing the 100-yen mark, a rare low. Compared to the highest price in January of last year at 271 yen, the difference is as much as 170 yen. Even compared to January of this year, it has fallen by more than 80 yuan, a truly shocking decline. The market prices for the past six months of this year are listed below (unit: Japanese yen, prices for June are up to the 23rd):</p>
<p>Highest Lowest Highest Lowest</p>
<p>January 183.60 176.90 April 170.10 157.90</p>
<p>February 176.60 167.70 May 155.60 139.90</p>
<p>March 164.60 152.70 June 141.60 102.50</p>
<p>The reasons for the decline are: (1) Yarn mills, in order to avoid a reduction in production after the abolition of night work, have strived to increase spindles, resulting in an unprecedented record of 260,000 bales, disrupting the balance between supply and demand. (2) The Hamaguchi Cabinet's implementation of the gold standard and tight monetary policies have led to instability in the financial world, reducing domestic consumption. (3) India has been a new market for Japanese cotton products in recent years, but since April, it has increased import duties on cotton fabrics by 6% and imposed an additional 5% on non-British goods, leading to a stagnation in exports to India. (4) On the Chinese side, the sharp fall in silver prices has led to a sharp decline in exports, and the situation is similar in places like Nanyang. (5) American cotton continues to fall, hitting new lows. All of these factors have had a major impact on the Japanese cotton industry, and the yarn market is declining. Although spinning mills have advocated for reduced working hours, it is difficult to reverse this decline. It seems unlikely that the decline in Japanese yarn prices will be curbed in the short term, as there are 300,000 bales of yarn and 500,000 bales of fabric in stock, and there is no sign of a turnaround in the environment. In the future, this will inevitably put considerable pressure on the Chinese yarn market, especially on Japanese yarn exports to China. Although the yarn market and the exchange rate are on the same line, the decline in yarn prices and the contraction of the exchange rate are not moving in proportion. At the current price of 102.50 yuan for Three Goods Yarn, the exchange rate is only about 144 taels in Chinese currency. Adding in transportation costs and tariffs, it is only about 165 taels, which is about 10 taels lower than Shanghai 20-count yarn. As a result, the talk of shipping Japanese yarn to China is prevalent. The decline in standard yarn prices is of great significance. It is heard that a certain Japanese trading house plans to purchase 20-count Japanese Black Crow and other yarns to ship to China for sale. If this is true, Chinese yarn may face considerable pressure again.</p>
<h3>Grain and Flour Markets Take a Sharp Turn Downward</h3>
<p>Frequent Reports of Foreign Wheat Hitting New Lows... Manufacturers Quietly Unloading</p>
<p>With the Changing Environment, It is Difficult to Raise Prices Again... Prices Plunge by Four Fens Across All Months</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market suddenly took a dive across all months. The reasons for the decline are partly due to the falling prices of foreign wheat, hitting lows not seen in years. Although the agreed-upon rate has not been reached, the market sentiment has been somewhat impacted. The other part is due to manufacturers gradually unloading quietly. The previous outside short sellers have become the manufacturer's chips. As long as wheat is sufficient, manufacturers do not worry about delivery difficulties. Outside speculative longs, at this point, can no longer blindly push prices up. With the changing environment, and wheat being in peak season, manufacturers no longer hold onto it and take advantage of the situation to pressure prices down. As a result, the current month fell by 3.25 fen compared to the previous week, July and October each fell by 4.25 fen, August and September fell by 4 fen, and November fell by 3.75 fen.</p>
<h3>Recent Wheat Prices Plunge by 1.6 Qian</h3>
<p>Spot Market Opens with 12,800 Bales</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures prices across all months plunged sharply. The reason for this is that foreign wheat prices are falling, and new wheat is entering peak season. Large and small manufacturers want to take advantage of this opportunity to purchase in large quantities, so they are outwardly trying to depress prices. As for the short sellers, besides gradually covering their existing short positions, their chips now seem to be for delivery. Therefore, bullish sentiment has suddenly become panic-stricken, and the market has taken a sharp turn downward, with prices plummeting. As a result, the current month plunged by a massive 1.6 qian compared to the previous week, July fell by 1.3 qian, and August to November all fell by 0.9 qian. Spot wheat prices are declining as manufacturers want to depress prices and are unwilling to rush in. Therefore, the opening prices for all grades are down by five to six fen. Prices for Huangqiao, Shashi, Jiangyan, Gaoyou, Liuhe, Zhuzhen, Kunshan, Pudong, Yizheng, and Pukou wheat are all high, and medium- and low-quality manufacturers have no appetite. Old wheat opened at 5.35 taels, with a total of 12,800 bales opened, all purchased by Fufeng.</p>
<h3>Imported Rice Sales are Brisk, but the Market is Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of imported rice were relatively good. The overall market opened with 12,000 bales of spot goods, and 7,000 to 8,000 bales of goods en route at the end of the month. These were purchased by various gangs from Ningbo, Wenzhou, and the mainland. The Ningbo gang had an even greater appetite, purchasing an additional 3,000 to 5,000 bales directly from traders in addition to purchasing from the market. There were also military purchases. In terms of sales, the market should have been stable. However, due to a new batch arriving, and more than 100,000 bales expected at the end of the month, sellers are eager to sell. In addition to spot goods, goods en route are also being sold, leading to a weakened market.</p>
<h3>Lower Rice Market Stalls</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Implements Rice Boat Registration</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Keng rice market in Zhabei had no transactions, only Bian rice had some trading. River rice was completely suspended. More than ten boats of medium- and low-quality goods were returned from Huangdu. Here, because the Social Affairs Bureau strictly limits white Keng rice to no more than 1 yuan and Changbang rice merchants violated the limit and raised prices, they are currently being investigated. Therefore, trading has been suspended. Now, the Social Affairs Bureau has decided to register all rice boats arriving from the river. All river rice goods must be accompanied by a registration certificate for inspection. Those without a registration certificate will be considered illegal goods and severely punished. All registered rice boats must have their prices publicly valued at the rice merchants' association. This procedure is currently being carried out as quickly as possible and is expected to be open within the next day or two. Because Bian rice is among the variegated varieties, there was a slight price discussion in the market, and the trend is very tight.</p>
<p>There are fewer and fewer boats arriving in South Shanghai, and there is virtually no trading in the market, resembling a complete standstill. The very few scattered Zhongguan Keng rice available are being sold by the local traders, and prices are gradually firming. Imported rice prices are also reported to be firming due to the influence of guests from the inner land competing to purchase.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Raw and White Sugar Rise to Eight Taels</h3>
<p>Japanese Car Sugar Opens with 60,000 Bales</p>
<p>Yesterday, the raw sugar market in the guild was still firm. A few buyers were slightly active, and the transaction price was eight taels. Later, sellers held on, and there were no further transactions. The market was stable. Medium and white sugar had few transactions. High-grade red sugar was asking for seven taels, but there were no buyers. Japanese sugar factories, Minghua Factory opened with 40,000 bales of car sugar for July delivery, priced at 7.9 taels for YRO mark, 8.2 qian for YT mark, and 8.4 qian for YP mark. Also, Meiji Factory opened with 20,000 bales for July and August delivery, priced at 6.6 qian for YT mark plus tax, equivalent to 8.2 taels. The trading houses were quite interested and sold all of them, which was quite charming.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Wuyuan Zhenmei is Selling Well Exclusively in Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in foreign trading houses in this port continued to show a trend of raising and lowering. Wuyuan Beixiang high-grade Zhenmei, due to its excellent manufacturing, bright color, European sales are exclusive, such as McDermott, Baochang, Fushi, Yongxing and other firms have a considerable appetite, trade is still not lonely, the market disk is also strong, but Tunxi, Suian, Shexian, Wenzhou Tuzhuang and other low-grade tea, still because of the Moroccan market, the bottom is abundant, sales are still stagnant, Qining black tea, the market gradually declined, the overall situation is still difficult to be considered optimistic.</p>
<h3>New Summer Cocoons from Hangzhou Arrive Increasingly</h3>
<p>In Hangzhou and other cities and townships, this year's summer silkworms have suffered damage due to cold weather and excessive rain, with most cases of white muscardine. The cocoon production is still poor. The cocoon shops around Gongchen Bridge are still being leased by silk factories such as Weicheng and Hulin. After the opening of the market, it was also worth the incessant rain, and few goods arrived in three days. The day before yesterday, the weather had cleared, although the arrival of cocoons on the market turned strong, and each firm released prices to compete for purchase, the price of high-grade goods has opened 70 yuan, this year the cocoon quality differences are huge, the late market is bullish, the second cocoon opened 54-55 yuan.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>Inaugural Issue of "The Vanguard Weekly" Evaluated by Bingheng</h3>
<p>Published by the Vanguard Society</p>
<p>Sold by Kaiming · Zhen Mei Shan Bookstore</p>
<p>Regarding literary books and newspapers, from a purely quantitative standpoint, it seems that they are experiencing a flourishing period. However, in reality, it is not easy to find a few good ones. Entering a bookstore, the red and green covers, and the pretense of great bargains, can be quite dazzling. However, if you randomly grab a few books from the shelves and flip through their contents, you will discover that many works are simply formulaic, merely "selling-ointment-style" eighteen-sentence hackneyed phrases, borrowing a few foreign terms to imitate and directly copy. Moreover, some so-called translations are truly "heavenly books," which no one can understand, let alone comprehend. Forcing oneself to flip through a few pages will inevitably lead to a headache.</p>
<p>Because of this—spending money and still getting a headache—I have become extra cautious about buying books. Consequently, "book and newspaper reviews" have become my only good friend, repeatedly and honestly introducing many valuable books to us, never letting us be fooled, and further increasing my interest in reading.</p>
<p>However, in the area of book and newspaper reviews, only book reviews are seen, while newspapers seem to be unmentioned. In my view, since it is called "book and newspaper reviews," "newspapers" should also be reviewed. Therefore, I boldly took the first step and introduced the inaugural issue of "The Vanguard Weekly," which I recently saw, to our readers.</p>
<p>Besides the inaugural statement, the inaugural issue of "The Vanguard Weekly" contains two essays and four short pieces. The two essays are Zemin's "The Decline of Chinese Literature" and Leisheng's "Nationalist Literature." The authors of the four short pieces are Jin Xuan, and they are: 1. "Mr. Lu Xun's Foresight," 2. "Charms and Sorcerers," 3. "Qian Xingcun's Way of Making Money," 4. "The So-Called Slave of Ideology."</p>
<p>The theory here is very substantial, and the attitude is also very serious. In "The Decline of Chinese Literature," the author not only clearly tells us about the "decline of old literature" and the "decline of new literature," but also points out the reasons for the decline of new literature. He says, "Because the so-called literary revolution was only a revolution in literary style, because new literature was only old literature with a new tone, new literature quickly declined." This is a fact that everyone should acknowledge.</p>
<p>At the same time, the author does not want to let our literature decline like this. Look at what he says:</p>
<p>Old literature has declined, and new literature has also declined. But should we let Chinese literature decline from now on?</p>
<p>No, and it must not happen, because literature is the highest expression of a nation's civilization. With the power of literature, the lives of all the people in a nation can be uplifted and beautified. With the power of literature, our spirit can be elevated and improved. With the power of literature, a society can be reformed and advanced... The decline of a nation's literature is the decline of a nation's culture. From ancient times to the present, nations with declining cultures have only been oppressed and never enjoyed a peaceful and happy life. Therefore, we must not let our country's literature decline, and we must never let it decline.</p>
<p>Originally, in our Chinese literary circles, from the literary revolution movement until now, in this short span of ten years or so, the situation has been as chaotic as our country's political situation. In this chaotic situation, we see that the remaining feudal ideology still maintains a great power, creating a great obstacle for new literature everywhere. And the general practitioners of new literature lack a central literary consciousness, often following their own whims, labeling themselves with certain isms and factions, establishing separate camps, and not yielding to each other. Some writers are still wielding two axes to guard the palace of art in the morning, and shouting about revolutionary literature in the evening. Some are talking about fun, and in the blink of an eye, they shout "sudden change" and become the leaders of proletarian literature. Still others are buying dried fish and releasing them, not knowing whether they are dead or alive. It would be fine to sing "Yu Tang Chun" with a lover, but they insist on shouting "classicism." In addition, each small organization embraces a subjective view, such as decadence, aestheticism, sentimentality, etc., etc., in various forms. Therefore, as the author says, "This is all acting out of emotion, forgetting what era it is now, forgetting China, and forgetting that they are Chinese. One is rejecting the people, and the other is forcing the people. Therefore, neither is a literature that the people can tolerate. As a result, the promotion of both has not achieved considerable results, and both have already determined their fate of destruction. This is truly a great crisis in China today." Let us look at the way he proposes to save Chinese literature:</p>
<p>We have seen the reasons for the decline of old literature, which is that it does not care about the people. We have also seen the reasons for the decline of new literature, which is that the tone of literature is relatively close to the people, but it has not yet established an ideology centered on the people. From these reasons for the decline of the old and new, we can get a plan to save our literature from decline. Relying on this plan, we can further develop the destiny of our literature.</p>
<p>Finally, he puts forward this plan: 丨</p>
<p>In order to save Chinese literature, in order to open up the path for Chinese literature, we must all unite and advocate nationalist literature.</p>
<p>In our literary circles, which lack a central literary consciousness, we must form a central literary consciousness to break through the current crisis and open up the path for Chinese literature. Therefore, the nationalist literature advocated by the author is well worth our study.</p>
<p>Leisheng's Nationalist Literature is an article dedicated to discussing this aspect, so after reading the previous article, we must read this one.</p>
<p>He first explains the relationship between nationalism and literature, and the reasons why our country's literature is not centered on the nation. Then, he clearly states the characteristics of nationalist literature.</p>
<p>He observes historical facts and determines that literature was originally national, and that the literature of various European countries was developed by relying on nationalism. He says,</p>
<p>How can it be said that literature was originally national?</p>
<p>...Before individual creation, literature was national. Like Greek mythology, the English Beowulf, the German Nibelungenlied, the Spanish El Cid, and our Book of Songs, none of them are not products of the nation. Therefore, although we are now difficult to determine what the original form of literature was, we can undoubtedly assert that the original state of literature did not arise from the literary consciousness of individuals, but from the life consciousness formed by the nation's position. In terms of literary form, the original literature was either national narrative literature, such as mythology, or national lyrical literature, such as national folk songs.</p>
<p>So literature was originally national.</p>
<p>How can it be said that the literature of various European countries was developed by relying on nationalism?</p>
<p>During the Middle Ages, Europe only had a mixed European literature, without distinguishing the literature of a certain country. Later, various countries used their own national languages to write arts, and thus the literature of various countries was established and developed separately. Why did various countries use their own languages to write literature? The most important reason is because nationalism had sprouted. The nationalist movement has become increasingly strong in the last hundred years, and nationalist literature has also become increasingly developed.</p>
<p>Then, he gives many examples. For example, when Napoleon invaded Russia, Russia suffered great losses. As a result, the Russian people realized the preciousness of nationalism. For a time, the Russian people focused on efforts to promote the Russian national spirit. Thus, the parents of Russian literature, Pushkin and Gogol, were born. The former used his talent to express the will of the Russian people, and the latter used the inherent interests and tendencies of the Russian nation as the center of literature. Therefore, Russian literature has the achievements of today. Another example is the recent French mystic poet Verlaine, who finally wanted to sing "Love of the motherland is first" in his later years. Other French novelists, such as Bai Leshi, also devoted themselves to the promotion of nationalism. These facts all make us believe that the development of literature in various European countries can be said to be entirely based on nationalism, and that the smaller the nation, the more obvious it is for literature to be centered on nationalism.</p>
<p>Below, he explains that our Chinese literary history is full of bureaucratic literary ideas and those who consider themselves pure and high-minded, unrestrained and decadent, and have nothing to do with the nation. Therefore, no Chinese individual creative literature has ever been centered on the nation. Moreover, he "honestly says" that these literatures that are not centered on the nation have been completely destroyed in this era of demanding national self-determination, and have nothing to do with the entire people of our nation.</p>
<p>Finally, he puts forward the characteristics of nationalist literature. In my opinion, this is the most important point. He says 丨丨</p>
<p>...Nationalist literature is powerful, hopeful, bright, willful, and spiritual. It is to awaken national consciousness, to stimulate national vitality, to unite together, and to fight for the nation. Before this sun-like nationalism, all literature that has been languishing, promiscuous, decadent, shy, aimless, and only knows how to be a slave must be destroyed and eliminated.</p>
<p>...The second characteristic of nationalist literature is a scalpel, not a needle. Nationalist literature must dissect and look at the good and evil, spirit and matter of our nation. Why is the nation corrupt? Where does the nation's decline come from? Why do Chinese bureaucrats only care about themselves and not the life and death of the nation? If such problems exist, nationalist literature must try to dissect them without concealing or covering them up.</p>
<p>...It is not allowed to do bad things that harm the nation. No matter what kind of people's actions they belong to, nationalist literature must consciously reject them. This is another characteristic of nationalist literature.</p>
<p>Nationalist literature never excludes foreign literature. If foreign literature is beneficial to the development of the nation, it should be absorbed as much as possible and turned into our nation's own thing... Nationalist art literature introduces foreign literature selectively, not purposefully, and absorbs it consciously, not just for temporary pleasure. Nationalist literature never abandons the spirit of the times, but wants to grasp the times and leap into the next era. What era is this now? It is an era in which powerful nations are doing their best to oppress small nations with imperialism, an era in which small nations are awakening and uniting to overthrow imperialism, and an era in which small nations are demanding national self-determination. Nationalist literature is precisely to strive to promote this spirit of the times, and to express the spirit of the next era, the era in which all nations in the world are equal.</p>
<p>In short, nationalist literature is literature that takes the nation's position and aims to promote the national spirit. It is hopeful, powerful, dissecting and critical, and grasping the spirit of the times. Here, we have a considerable understanding of nationalist literature. In this chaotic situation in the Chinese literary world, we must focus on awakening national consciousness, and concentrate our efforts on the creation of nationalist art literature from now on.</p>
<p>As for the four short pieces, the insights are very sharp and the observations are also very thorough. After reading the two essays, reading these four short pieces is truly a different kind of taste.</p>

<h3>Shylock's Daughter</h3>
<p>Although the Drama Society's "The Merchant of Venice" has already been performed once, I, a poor middle school student, did not have the opportunity to appreciate such art due to time, financial, and location constraints. It just so happened that the time of this revival was after our final exam, so I went to see it once. Regarding the scenery, besides being realistic and magnificent, there is indeed nothing else to say. Among the characters in the play, the one who can attract me the most and make me express sympathy for is not the male protagonist Bai Shan Nu, nor the female protagonist Pu Xi Ya, nor the evil Shylock, but a very unimportant role in the play: Shylock's daughter Xia Xikai.</p>
<p>Ms. Gu Xiuzhong in "The Merchant of Venice" by the Drama Society</p>
<p>She was unfortunately born as the daughter of an evil and stubborn Jew. Her father has the characteristics of a typical Jew: loving money more than love and obeying unreasonable old etiquette. Therefore, she is very unfree. She knows her father's illegal and cruel exploitation of profits, but she cannot stop it. Therefore, she resolutely ignores the Jewish customs of hatred towards other religions and not marrying outside the religion, and leaves her father with her lover. The whole play only describes this point about her, and it is not very related to the other characters. Therefore, she is in a very unimportant position in the play. However, from this extremely short description, it is enough for us to fully recognize her, to admire her far-sightedness and the fortitude of her behavior.</p>
<p>At least, when I think about it, she is the prototype of a part of modern Chinese women. There are countless Chinese women like her who are doubly oppressed by stubborn families and unreasonable etiquette. So, please enlarge your courage, open your eyes, and work hard to move forward.

<h3>Shanghai University Boy Scouts Go to Japan</h3>
<p>What a pleasant and rare opportunity! Taking advantage of the current long summer-like leisure time, the Boy Scouts of Shanghai University will go to Japan on July 6 to observe and travel in a foreign country.</p>
<p>Speaking of Japan, it is close at hand, but in terms of customs, habits, and writing, it is not far from our China. However, it has now been promoted to a strong country in East Asia. Therefore, I think that if we want China to become strong, the education, politics, economy, and other driving forces that constitute a strong country and a strong race in Japan are more worthy of our attention and research than those in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>Although I dare not say that the training results of the Shanghai University Boy Scouts are the best in all schools in China, the motivation for this trip to Japan is to be invited by them, and to represent all the Boy Scouts in China.</p>
<p>The number of people going to Japan this time is a group of forty-one people, led by Mr. Ni Jiaxi. Although the school has already started its vacation, this group of Boy Scouts who decided to go to Japan will return to the school on June 29.</p>

<h3>Writing a Couplet for Zhiyuan Hall at Jinan University</h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Hanmin, an important figure in the party and the country, is currently a member of the Central Committee and the President of the Legislative Yuan. He is trusted by the people for his revision of laws. Mr. Hu also likes calligraphy in his spare time and is good at Han Li calligraphy. Those who obtain his calligraphy are regarded as treasures. Principal Zheng Shaojue of Jinan University has a close relationship with President Hu. After the completion of the Jinan University Auditorium last year, he specially invited Mr. Hu to inscribe the name "Zhiyuan Hall." The large characters are both strong and gentle. At the same time, President Hu also collected a couplet from Cao Quan's stele, which reads: "Assisting the world and benefiting the people, the foundation of politics lies in learning; shouldering heavy responsibilities and achieving great ambitions, overseas Chinese children are easy to succeed." It has now been engraved and hung high in Zhiyuan Hall (An).</p>

According to reports, Ms. Li is one of the overseas Chinese and used to live in Southeast Asia. She previously came to Shanghai to study at Shanghai University. Later, due to life and environmental factors, she transferred to Jinan University, because that school is the highest institution for overseas Chinese, and its facilities and environment are more in line with the psychology and needs of overseas Chinese. Therefore, she is happy to transfer to Jinan University. It is also heard that Ms. Li, several weeks after returning from the sports meeting, went south with her family. She will not return to China until the end of the summer vacation, and the school authorities have also approved her leave (An).</p>

<h3>The Story of World Literature (170) by American John Macy, Translated by Hu Zhongchi</h3>
<p>Chapter 44: Modern Spanish Literature</p>
<p>Here is the warm Southern Europe, like a leaf eaten by insects,</p>
<p>Stretching out her lands, breathing upon the sea, with equal love leaning upon the Mediterranean, murmuring with memories,</p>
<p>And upon the boundless ocean, where no one has ever crossed, chest bared is Spain.</p>
<p>丨丨George Eliot</p>
<p>After the faded Golden Age of the seventeenth century, Spanish literature, like Italian literature, lacked certainty or originality and declined. As when speaking of Italy, I will present a question for study or reflection, without a dogmatic answer: Is the political and economic decline of a nation accompanied by a decline in its artistic and intellectual power? The War of the Spanish Succession, around the same time that Sweden and Russia fought in Eastern Europe, dragged England, France, Austria, Prussia, Spain, and the Netherlands into the vortex. Later, at the end of the same century, the French Revolution broke out, pulling most of Europe into that vortex. No country could calmly focus on spiritual matters. However, English and French literature showed continued vitality through various means, and in the non-Prussian parts of Germany, new life was about to emerge. In other countries, literature stagnated.</p>
<p>At that time, France was the leading intellectual kingdom on the continent, and Spain was one of its most obedient vassals. The enchanting folk songs of laughter and tragedy and the rogue-like, beautiful stories of great Spain lost their vitality and became ordinary disciples of Paris. Even at the beginning of the nineteenth century, when Spain was striving to throw off Napoleon's yoke, the peninsula remained intellectually dependent on its political oppressor. Surprisingly, despite this dependence, Spanish literature, literary Spain, did not grasp the great spirit of France. The Romantic revival, which shone brightly in most of European thought and blazed in great literature, only smoldered in Spain. The most Romantic country in Europe failed to catch fire.</p>
<p>The reason, or one reason, is that the Spaniards, who seem to have excellent stage presence, only appeared that way to the rest of Europe, to Hugo, to Mérimée, to John Singer Sargent, to literary travelers, despite their various poses. Spaniards most truthfully observe themselves in their best books and paintings (I say this at the risk of provoking controversy among painters and art critics). Therefore, when Spanish literature raised its head in the mid-nineteenth century and gradually occupied an important position in world literature, the new people remained loyal to the Spanish life depicted and were more "realistic" than "Romantic." However, it goes without saying that the novelists and playwrights were universally Romantic in their emotions and writing; otherwise, the world would never have heard of them.</p>
<p>One modern Spanish playwright who is part of the literature of Western civilization is Echegaray, an incredible genius. Originally a mathematician, he decided to try writing plays relatively late in life. His unique talent clearly does not belong to the race of Calderón but clearly belongs to the excavating, vacillating nineteenth century—the genius of Ibsen, Hauptmann, Pinero, Shaw, etc., belonging to the theatrical figures who seem not to decline but to strengthen in modern times. 丨丨This is a good sign for the truth on stage and does not exclude the theatrical humor that the Spaniards once boasted of. Echegaray is not a humorist with a dark, laughterless meaning. His most beautiful plays, "The Son of Don Juan" and "Mariana," are strongly "Spanish" but are studies of human nature that can be understood anywhere in this round world, and Echegaray has become an outstanding figure in world literature. His reputation is said to be declining, but in no branch of literature is fame and fortune as easily changed as in stage literature. In stage literature, there is nothing more immortal than the glory of Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Molière, etc. To know what posterity will think of the plays of Echegaray, Ibsen, Hauptmann, Shaw, etc., it seems necessary to live another century. However, today they penetrate people's hearts with vitality, and tomorrow other playwrights may appear to take their place.</p>
<p>丨丨In Cervantes' country, where things never completely die, would this happen? 丨丨Spanish novels reawakened in the mid-nineteenth century, and their essence was realistic. Why? Because, as we have suggested, Romantic Spain is not Romantic in literature. One of the truest speakers is a woman who calls herself Fernán Caballero. Her most famous novel, "La Gaviota" (The Seagull), is widely read outside Spain, and although somewhat faded, it still maintains life because of something important—the truth about the characters and scenes. There is some of this truth in the works of Alarcón, who practiced the tradition of rogue novels, the most admirable, incoherent, and formless form of Spanish novels. His novel of rural life, "El sombrero de tres picos" (The Three-Cornered Hat), is honest jest. Alarcón is not a great artist but belongs to the continuous bloodline of old-fashioned Spanish storytellers.</p>
<p>In terms of time and literary development, after Alarcón came Pereda, who wrote about farmers and sailors and the scenes that are considered the basis of their lives, namely, the mountains and the sea. In Spanish literature, he has always been called the founder of modern realism; he probably deserves this title. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that one of the characteristics of Spanish novels over three centuries, those untraditional romances, novels of life, is their realism, their faithfulness to character. Pereda did not invent a new type of story; he inherited that characteristic. Furthermore, it must also be remembered that modern Spanish novels have a strong local color in terms of scenery and character depiction. This may be a true value, but it limits Spanish novels to Spain. Very little Spanish literature has crossed the mountains to become part of the universal literature of Europe.</p>
<p>Pereda was a very sincere and strict religious conservative. His contemporary, Valera, was a more cheerful, mystical skeptic, a man of the world, and gifted with a moving elegance. Valera's main novel, "Pepita Jiménez," shows both sides of his genius. It is the story of a mystical monk with noble aspirations, which are shattered before the facts, most of which are, of course, women. Before he startled his contemporaries with that first novel at the age of fifty, Valera was already famous as a poet and essayist. After that, in novels and short stories, he improved his art and 丨shone the truth in a Shakespearean style丨 repeatedly showed his face, and he lived until the end of the same century. He was seen as the head of Spanish literature at that time.</p>
