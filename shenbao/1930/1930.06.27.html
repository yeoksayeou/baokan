<p>— 秉</p>
<p>葉秋原著藝術論文集</p>
<p>聯合書店出版</p>
<p>在這民族主義的文藝運動霹靂一聲震動了中國文壇的時候我想介紹這本［藝術之民族性與國際性］给我們的讀者大槪不是没有意義的事罷</p>
<p>本書共分三部第一部藝術論第二部文學論第三部藝術史論爲節省時間和篇幅起見本文只限於介紹那與民族主義文藝比較密切的第一部藝術論其餘二部只好留下等有機會時再談</p>
<p>藝術論是六個短篇藝術論文的組合一他的立論在目前這種思想極度動摇而陷於畸形發展的病態中的中國藝壇上可以説是一支異軍突起</p>
<p>在作者正也是看不過中國藝壇這樣没落下去所以他説［爲欲使我們的藝術界日趨於健全的發展的道路我覺得在今日起來説幾句話實在是下容再待了明知在這大動摇的時代（或者不能理會稍爲嚴重一點的理論］（三九頁）雖然我們也覺到在這大動摇的時代有許多人正像是喝醉了酒似的醉眼朦朧是非不辨仗着一股酒興便亂呌亂跳起來你倘不知就理還正言好意的來和他、</p>
<p>講道理那當然是空費唇舌一個字也不能入他的耳朶弄得不好他還要懐着惡意對你不客氣像這等不討好的事聰明的人是不很願意去幹的但是我們决不能容許一個醉人爲所欲爲這也是必然的事倘一個個袖手旁觀那一切都不免要破壞在醉人的手裹了在目前的藝術界正也是如此我們覺得越是這大動摇的時代我們越需要嚴重的理論而藝術家所負的責任料愈益加重萬不能望着藝術給一班醉人型得烏烟瘴氣而至於滅亡的</p>
<p>在這裹我們知道作者是忠於藝術的所以他終於不能緘默同時更可以看出他對於藝術所包的主張和中國藝術界目前的病態以及今後藝術界應當共同努力的途徑</p>
<p>在現代藝術主潮篇中他説明了現代主義的　　及其分布和發展在藝術的意義裏把藝術的本質藝術的分類藝術的起源逐一論及了乃提出新藝術的精神來他説近代藝術的精神是動是原始末後他更引朱應鵬先生的話來作結新藝術運動至少是含有充分的現世思想和充分的自由思想至少要向理敎思想進攻向宗敎思想進攻向山林隱逸思想進攻向命運思想進攻向吟風弄月紅男緑女式的文學進攻］作者是極表贊同這種主張的所以他並希望有相當的建設有相當的創造</p>
<p>作者是認爲藝術離不了政治的他以歷史上的事實證明了他那［藝術不能離開政治藝術隨政治以演化］與民族藝術之發展須充的民族觀念的理論</p>
<p>在藝術之民族性與國際性篇中作者更認定了近代政治完全是受民族主義和國際主義的支配這兩種潮流看來是積不相容但却有很密切的因果社會愈趨國際化而民族主義的色彩也愈益明顯倘在這種國際化的潮流之下而不將自已的民族色彩表現出來便不免要自取滅亡了　因此　藝術在國際化的時候藝術上的民族性也越發要有顯而在國際上能充分的表現我們民族的精神以獲到我們優越的國際地位的基礎　　作者　在現代藝術與民族主義裹把藝術與民族的關係説得更爲透澈現在引證於下以作本文的結果</p>
<p>······藝術相終要以民族爲背景民族的生活才是藝術作品表現的題材藝術是民族的國民的即在西文所謂ＮＡtionalart藝術所謂國民藝術或民族藝術是以民間的生活民間底思想民間的宗敎和其民族的風趣Ｌocialornationaltemqerment爲其藝術的目的這種情形是顯然的在西洋藝術家從事於民族的國民的藝術以是民族爲前提而以發揚民族的風趣自任在中國這種情形是不見的中國人只有家風只有家學却没有民族的風趣和民族的生活現代藝術還是一種國民的或民族的藝術雖則這種運動</p>
<p>似乎影響及到各國</p>

<p>第四十四章近代西班牙文學</p>
<p>我們來到最近代的西班牙小説時這個興味是無疑的同説到别的近代文學一樣我們對於現代的西班牙人也不能多説在我看來現存讀者非自已來篩理爐灰不可這並非説誰都能夠照顧全世界的爐灶却説的是凡有聰明的讀者能夠協力來參加篩理的事情的</p>
<p>在現存西班牙人中秀拔的作家之間最忠實地執着於作爲作家的自已的職業自已的業務自已的藝術者是比俄巴洛耶他的］小心人的市場［使人見到都會和許多的街道和暗衖和人們之間的衝突以及放縱和冐險的姿相而且巴洛耶對於不同的社會階級間有些絶望底的對立是有着感情的例如在一篇小説裹（那英譯的標題［探索］全不是西班牙語的標題但那譯文是極好的）他將近代都市的兩都是不幸的夜的生活和晝的生活間的對照描寫出來</p>
<p>以大體而言年青的人們反對着確立的社會底及政治底制度而西班牙的藝術家常使他的藝術和政治混合致損害了它這種話則是英吉利最優的西班牙文學的批評家所説的這也許是對的然而在别的諸國最優秀最勇敢的藝術家却也有反對他所不喜歡的政府或者爲了他所喜歡的政府而執劍或筆在手的微克忒囂俄呀十七世紀英吉利的騎士詩人呀托爾斯泰呀差不多一切俄羅斯人呀請想起他們一回罷人問的就是詩對於政治有什麽關係呢這且不論我以爲在英譯不很出名的近代西班牙的最有興味的人們之一是烏奈謨諾做着論文家·諷剌家·雜誌記者·诗人的他獲得了從他的故國放逐的光榮放逐這種事是對付文學者時候近代政府並不多行的懲罰形式爲什麽呢因爲流刑立即增加了他們的聲價思想於是流布於世界而值得處流刑的人物也許被揣想爲知道以文章報復的這緣故</p>
<p>還有一個反抗政府的西班牙人就是那著名的作家勃拉思科·伊本湼兹我承精明的批評家告知在西班牙他是被看做戲料的不錯他正是出色的上等戲料造成他的國際底聲譽的（或者因爲這以前他的幾種書已經譯成英語及其他的國語了的縁故確定那聲譽的）［默示録的四騎士［包含着使人非常銘感的劇底的場景點綴得巧妙訴於當人人在戰爭之中或爲了戰爭受苦時的類似的人們的心的然而因爲我們是被應許作戲言的我們不妨將故ＭＤ霍惠爾氏所作的勃拉思科·伊本湼兹論的話來引用一下罷一伊本湼支成就着越過亨利詹姆士的藝術以外的効果然而縱使這樣以輕巧和美而言他是降落到詹姆士之下的］</p>
<p>愛西班牙讀許多西班牙的書的霍惠爾氏在兩個同代的西班牙人跋勒·因克蘭及自稱亞若林的ＪＷ路意慈中也許見到輕巧和美麗的罷跋勒·因克蘭是細　　第四十五章　荷蘭及法蘭德斯荷蘭的被懷抱於海而睡眠的地方</p>
<p>飛行呵我的空想到異心的人們那里去</p>
<p>我想大洋的靠了陸地而憇息的地方</p>
<p>她那耐心的孩子們正停佇立在眼前哩</p>
<p>丨哥德斯密</p>
<p>在這一小章説到的作家大半是十九世紀以前的人那麽我們是蹂躪著年代底順序了然而要將希奇得很並不過分重要的這一章來安揷這里似乎是第一方便的地方了</p>
<p>爲什麽呢因爲荷蘭文學是不重要的就這主題慷慨地給我敎益的兩個博學的荷蘭人也對於本國的文學特是後代的文學取幾乎蔑視底的熊度而同意於這句话偶或過訪歐羅巴（及亞美利加）的美術館的旅行者要吃驚於荷蘭的繪巧的藝術家「公爵勃拉陀明的愉快的回顧録」及取材於卡羅斯黨戰爭的優美的三部作的著者　亞若林是有機才和價值的作品「小哲學者的自白」的著者那作品是負有進到世界的文庫之中去的運命的（倘若我們可以戲弄運命）在現代西班牙文學中有着不少的前程和功績我們僅能將此暗示一下便須駕乘飛機旅行到從前政治底西班牙没有予以親善的待遇的那一國去了</p>
<p>文學</p>
<p>畫的豐富的罷當學藝復興期之際意大利人是荷蘭人及法蘭德斯人的唯一的競爭者意大利人在文學的一切形式上都是極偉大的然而荷蘭人却將其全部的力盡傾於文學以外的諸藝術或者荷蘭語同近鄰的德意志語一樣直至近代爲止没有成就高度的發逹老是重厚而不柔順的也説不定罷</p>
<p>兩個最大的荷蘭人即斯賓梛莎及伊拉斯莫斯是不用荷蘭語却寫拉丁語的人文主義者在較前一章我們所遇到的托馬斯谟耳的友人伊拉斯莫斯同凡有人文主義者一樣有着倒撥時鐘阻止近代語的成長的傾向爲什麽呢因爲在人文主義者看來凡有優點都在於希臘語及拉丁語伊拉斯莫斯是眞實的意味上的學者他愛文學愛古典文學尤其愛敎會文學因爲在敎會文學之中他同當時（一五○○那年將他的七十年的生涯分割爲兩個相等的部分的事請記着罷)大多數的人們一樣看出他以爲眞理這東西來學藝復興期的人們的古典主義大都不是古代羅馬人該能了解的希臘或拉丁底不是異敎底·却是基督敎底伊拉斯莫斯的最優的方面是他的書翰和以關於種種雜多的主材的對話集成的「對話書」倘若不説一句比較價值的話就將柏拉圖的「對话篇」伊拉斯莫斯的「對話書」和蘭得的「空想底會話」擺在同一書架上面一起看着這也不算是拙劣的批評罷</p>
<p>伊拉斯莫斯死了一世紀之後那旣非基督敎徒又非異敎徒却是猶太敎徒的人斯賓挪莎在亞摩斯德登出世他和倍根·笛卡兒·白魯诺一同是近代哲學的創設者之一斯賓挪莎正如我所提示何以屬於我們的紀録乃是疑問因爲他是嚴格·難解·專門底的哲學者而寫着有些緊縮的學者底拉丁語的他的文章據拉丁學者告我則是健全而精確的思想家是在那里然而有藝術家的色彩（伊拉斯莫斯有着這個·倍根也有·而在現代則尼采·培那特蕭維廉廉詹姆士·散逹亞那也有的文學者在那里却欠缺着他的方法是一稱哲學底幾何學·是在設了定理附以番號·證明·系説·公理直至十九世紀的初葉赫得·勒新諾伐利斯·哥德等哲學者及文學者再發見了他爲止他埋没了百年現在他是哲學思想上的英雄之一了而且恐怕他没有全然缺着文學底色彩罷他的「倫理學」的一部的標題「關於人類的拘束」是被取爲Ｗ·索美塞得·毛根所冩的現代的最深最美的小説的標題的</p>
<p>在荷蘭文學同在一切文學一樣要尋求最有香味的材料我們非行於傳説·民謡·通俗羅曼斯之中不可荷蘭至少貢獻了一篇出於吟游詩人維楞的手筆的世界著名的「列那狐」的詩的譯作這是那著名的故事的最古的譯本之一這由卡克斯敦從無可疑的荷蘭語的散文譯本譯爲英語了這樣的傳説·羅曼斯·諷剌從一國移到别國去問題不過在於改作者的·輸入者的技巧而現在以小説詩·及批評而言也還照樣是唯一的問題在中世紀文學底所有權的觀念没有存在作者無須告歉地採取任何地方見到的思想Ｒeinaert（列那狐）似乎是以荷蘭譯文流行的唯一的偉大故事而且這是曾經非常風靡的最富於生彩的近代本就是哥德的Ｒeineckefuch</p>
<p>最大的荷蘭的作家是詩人奉得爾他生於十六世紀的末葉經歷了十七世紀的四分之三他寫過悲劇那是將劇底力和抒情詩底美相結合的在一方面他因爲劇化了聖書的英雄底故事是被比較於拉辛的在别一方面則他的傑作「琉息斐」將他和密爾頓聯在一起密爾頓彷彿是至少有着那偉大的荷蘭劇的學者底智識似的然而他從那裹採取了什麽却是疑問「失樂園」和「恢復的樂園」和「琉息斐」除了主材和高貴的文體之外没有什麽共通的東西那兩個詩人行着全不相同的處理方法［琉息斐］是劇底而且抒情底密爾頓的詩則是叙事詩底故事那個詩人和他的政治底及宗敎底背景的優美的説明是在ＡＪ巴爾奴敎授所作的奉得爾的傳記</p>
<p>奉得爾的時代以後荷蘭文學衰頽下去十八世紀的作品大部分是十分沉悶的在同世紀的末葉及十九世紀的初葉復活到來了新紀元的先驅者是敎訓底詩人皮爾台爾地克他那明慧的詩在荷蘭非常風行但在别國却没有給人什麽印象倘在英吉利他該算是第二流的作詩家罷他是博得羅伯騷狄那樣優秀的批評家的尊敬的正經的學者然而從他以爲莎士比亞欠斟酌而且嫌厭新德意志詩這一種事實上却能夠推知他那對於美的意識的觀念的</p>

<p>Continuous Fierce Fighting Between Qi County and Chenliu</p>
<p>The Eighth Division Captured Over Two Thousand Enemy Soldiers</p>
<p>A Dispatch from the Xuzhou Forward Headquarters: Our Eighth Division's main force,</p>
<p>on the line of Qi County, defeated the enemy army and captured over one thousand enemy soldiers. They are currently joining forces with our left flank. (Special Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>The troops of Mao Bingwen from Nanjing opened up the Longhai area, and after that, they encountered the enemy's troops of Sun Lianzhong and Gao Shuxun at Dutangji, engaging in fierce fighting for two days and nights. The enemy could not withstand the attacks and collapsed, fleeing in disarray towards the northwest. Our army then occupied the area and captured hundreds of enemy officers and soldiers. (Special Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Qian, the Deputy Brigade Commander of the 17th Brigade of the Sixth Division in Nanjing, is scheduled to go to the front lines on the 27th to report everything to Division Commander Zhao Guantao. (Special Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>A Dispatch from Beiping: Since the beginning of the Longhai battle, the Longhai Railway staff have reported that the fighting is fierce. A certain station has been closed, and the sound of gunfire is very clear. The battle line stretches for thirty miles. The troops of Feng Yuxiang and Pang Bingxun have joined the Longhai front to fight. (Special Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>A Dispatch from Beiping: According to Longhai Railway technicians, there have been no major battles between Lanfeng and Minquan recently. However, very dense artillery fire and the circling of airplanes can be heard 50 li away from the railway line, between Qi County and Chenliu. Details of the battle are unknown. (Special Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Beiping: According to reliable sources on the foreign side, there was a major battle on the Longhai line last week. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has joined the battlefield with heavy reinforcements. There are at least ten divisions participating in the fighting. (Reuters Dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Feng's Army Withdraws Towards Heshangqiao</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanjing: Xu Yuanquan, since capturing Yancheng on the 23rd, has joined forces with the right flank of Zhoujiakou's Shangguan Yunxiang and the left flank of Wuyang's Yang Hucheng to encircle Xiangcheng and Linying in a pincer movement. (Special Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanjing: The troops of Xu Yuanquan, Shangguan Yunxiang, and Xiao Zhichu on the Pinghan Railway line have been ordered to recover Yingzhou and Fugou within three days. The vanguard of Shangguan's division has crossed Zhoujiakou and arrived at Fugou. The enemy is withdrawing towards Heshangqiao and is currently being pursued. (Special Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>A telegraph from Nanjing's Zhumadian on the 26th: (1) Approximately 2,000 men from Ren Yingqi's division, stationed at Xiating, were surrounded and defeated by Hao Menglin's division. (2) Tian Jinkai's remnant troops attacked the positions north of Daxindian on the 24th and were severely defeated by Xiao Zhichu's troops, with many captured. (Special Dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Military news from Nanjing: Xiao Zhichu's division routed the enemy troops of Ni Yusheng, who were entrenched in the areas of Douwang, Zhihe, and Miao. They then occupied Xiaozhangzhuang and Zhihe Miao, among other places. (Special Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Xu Yuanquan recently stated to the outside world in Nanjing that the withdrawal of his army to Luohe was a pre-determined plan. During the withdrawal, powerful forces were used to launch fierce attacks on the Northwest Army, inflicting significant damage on the enemy, so the Northwest Army never dared to pursue. The withdrawal of this army was extremely safe, and after capturing Linying, defeating the rebel armies of Zhang Weixi, Tian Jinkai, Sun Lianzhong, and others, and pressing towards Xuchang, it was originally planned to quickly eliminate the remaining bandits and strike directly at Zhengzhou. Just as the left flank was successfully maneuvering to take Suqiao and cut off the enemy's return route, two divisions of the rebel army of Shi Zhenqing and others suddenly attacked the right rear flank of our Ninth Army, causing the entire line to waver. General Commander He of our Third Army Corps, fearing that our army would be isolated and in danger, ordered them to withdraw to Luohe together with the Ninth Army to establish defenses, intending to lure the enemy out and annihilate them. This was a change in strategy and did not damage the military situation in any way. However, the Japanese Dentsu News Agency stationed in Hankou fabricated rumors and engaged in slander without any reason, which was not only shocking to hear but also shook the morale of the army. It is suspected that there are reactionary elements lurking within our ranks colluding with foreigners, hoping to sabotage our efforts. It is requested that this matter be strictly investigated and that the news agency be given a severe warning. (Special Dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>A dispatch from Hong Kong: Zhang Guiji's army is invading Guangdong in three routes: one route descends diagonally from eastern Hunan through Nankang and Xinfeng, invading southern Guangdong's Nanxiong; the second route of Zhang's army enters Gan through Chaling, Jian, and Ruijin, joining with Jin Handing's rebellious troops to attempt to seize the East River; and the third route of Huang Shaoxiong's troops enters Guangdong's North River through Yongming and Jianghua. (Special Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Jiang, Cai, and Li's three divisions are consolidating the Guangdong border. (Special Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>A dispatch from Changsha: The troops under Liu Jianxu engaged in fierce fighting for half a day with the combined forces of Gui, Zhang, and Tang at Gengqiao and Sikongshan, capturing over a thousand. According to their confessions, the false 47th, 8th, and 5th armies are all fleeing towards Chen, Yong, and Nan, while small units under Li Pinxian and others are fleeing westward towards Chaling.

<h3 id="e4">New Regulations for Tianjin Customs Duties <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin: Three more ships arrived in Tianjin on the 26th, all claiming that the import duties to be collected by the Tianjin Customs had already been collected by the Shanghai Customs and could not be paid a third time. However, the ships could not provide proof that the Shanghai Customs had collected the Tianjin import duties, which made it difficult to believe. On the evening of the 26th, Ge Jingyou and Xin Bosen discussed countermeasures and decided to issue a public notice on the morning of the 27th stating that for all imported goods, taxes should be paid at the Tianjin Customs. For goods that have not yet arrived in Tianjin, if they are forcibly collected in the first port of China through illegal procedures, this customs will temporarily implement the following accommodating measures for these goods. All customs declaration and tax inspection procedures will still be handled according to the old regulations. After the goods are valued, the amount of customs duties to be paid must be deposited with this customs, and this customs will issue a deposit receipt. The merchants themselves will then demand the return of all tax money from the previously illegally collecting organizations. If it is truly impossible to recover the money, they may submit the tax payment evidence to this customs so that it can negotiate with the various ports. The tax money paid can be refunded in full based on the deposit receipt. The river works and bridge works surcharges will still be paid to the bank as before. This is hereby announced.

<h3 id="e5">Successful Experiment Yesterday <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Wang Boqun Received a Handwritten Telegram from Jiang Zuobin</p>
<p>The long-distance wireless telegraphic facsimile between Nanjing and Eurasia was successfully tested at 6:00 PM on the 26th in the open space within the Xiaoying Education Regiment in the capital. Minister of Transportation Wang Boqun, Secretary Song Shuqiao, and Section Chief Nie Chuanru of the Telecommunications Administration were present. Minister Wang received a handwritten telegram from German Ambassador Jiang Zuobin, which read: "To His Excellency Minister Wang Boqun of the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing. Ambassador Jiang is visiting Northern Europe. Taking advantage of the German wireless photography service, I send my regards. The staff of the Embassy in Germany send their greetings. The handwriting is clear, and it took four and a half minutes to receive the authentic document from thousands of miles away." The observers were amazed. Regarding the reporting situation, the machine is divided into four parts: 1. Antenna: Two directional antennas, one for transmission and one for reflection, to remove useless radio waves and concentrate power. The direction of the line is from northeast to southwest, opposite Berlin. The two poles are made of wood and shaped like towers, about 40 meters apart and of the same height. 2. Power: There is a kerosene engine and a DC generator, each used for various vacuum tubes and small motors. 3. Wireless Machine: There is a receiver. The circuit program of this machine is a super regenerative type. It passes through a high-speed wave amplifier, detector, and other equalizers to keep the received radio waves in a normal state. From there, it is bounced onto the facsimile machine. 4. Facsimile Receiver: This machine is a Lulude-style machine. One end is an electromagnetic sound generator, which is a vibration tube with an amplifier. The manager is used to make the speed of the synchronous motor of the rotating receiver side's photographic box the same as that of the transmitting station's transmitter. At the same time, the received radio waves are converted into light waves by a specially made battery of Lulude, and the light waves are refracted into the photographic stage through three prisms, etc., reaching the film to form an image. The received wave power is 17 meters. It is heard that the transmitter at the transmitting station is even more complicated. (Special Dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e9">World Disputes Where Both Sides Are in Difficulty <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Generally, disputes where one side is in difficulty but the other side still has room for concessions can be resolved through human mediation. However, if both sides are in extreme difficulty and concessions would harm their own survival, then no matter how much mediation or consultation, it will inevitably lead to irreconcilable differences and then stop. All the disputes in the world today are of the type where both sides are in difficulty. After commercial decline, capitalists have no way to maintain the lives of workers, and workers are facing increasingly difficult lives and increasing unemployment. A situation has arisen where neither party can make concessions. This is one example. The people's economy is exhausted, and the government has no way to remedy it. The government's finances are depleted, and the people have no means to contribute. However, the government cannot but take from the people, and the people cannot but beg from the government. Again, a situation has arisen where neither party can make concessions. This is another example. What one country gains is what another country loses. If one country does not gain, it cannot survive, and if another country loses, it cannot survive. This is yet another example where a situation has arisen where neither party can make concessions. All of these examples are just the major ones; there are countless other disputes of this kind. Therefore, the crisis where countries have no choice but to fight is always present. How can there be peace and tranquility?</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 25th. German Foreign Minister Dr. Curtius stated today during a parliamentary debate on the Foreign Ministry's budget that one of the main points of Germany's foreign policy is to maintain peace and seek complete political freedom and equal rights. The aftermath of the war is not yet over. Germany does not want various countries to be divided into several groups, so the League of Nations occupies an important position. However, the provisions for resolving various international disputes are not yet complete, and the progress of disarmament, protection of minorities, and economic cooperation is too slow.</p>
<p>Guomin News, Berlin, 25th. The selection of a successor to German Finance Minister Moldenhauer, a member of the National People's Party who resigned, has not yet been resolved. It was previously rumored that Prussian Finance Minister Aschoff was a promising candidate, but it is now heard that the Democratic Party opposes this move. Recently, there has been talk of transferring Economic Minister Tietjen, but because the key points of his proposed financial plan differ greatly from Moldenhauer's, the National People's Party cannot agree and has threatened that if Tietjen becomes Finance Minister, Curtius, the party's sole representative in the government, will immediately withdraw from the cabinet. However, Curtius has stated that he will give a speech in Parliament this afternoon on important diplomatic procedures. Many in the political world believe that Curtius's speech will be sufficient to indicate that even if he is not a representative of the National People's Party, he is willing to remain as Foreign Minister.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Crisis of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Rubber Tapping Suspended</p>
<p>Small Capital Merchants Plunge into Bankruptcy</p>
<p>Tin Overproduction</p>
<p>100,000 Chinese Workers Face Unemployment</p>
<p>Southeast Asia Correspondence. The period during the European War was truly the golden age of Southeast Asia. Overseas Chinese merchants regarded Southeast Asia as their second home and their business ventures were quite impressive. Who would have known that the prosperous, beautiful, and resource-rich Nanyang islands would, in less than a decade, show signs of fatigue and decay? The major exports of Southeast Asia are rubber and tin. Since the balance between production and consumption has been lost, the prices of rubber and tin have fallen again and again, causing those residing in Southeast Asia to sigh at the sluggish market and the difficulty of making a living. The highest price of rubber before and after the European War was over 400 silver dollars per ton, but now it has fallen to over 20 silver dollars. The price of tin in 1921 was over £420 per ton, but now it is £130 per ton. In just ten years, the price difference is so great. The reason why the price of rubber is so low is, first, because there are few buyers from London; second, because of the increase in inventory in various places; and third, because of the prevalence of the inland sales system and indiscriminate sales. If the production of rubber in Southeast Asia is not restricted, it will accumulate more and more. The planting association has decided to suspend tapping for one month in May to save the precarious situation. Now the period of suspension has passed, but the price of rubber continues to fall. Statistics show that the inventory of rubber in major cities such as London and New York has reached over 440,000 tons. Since this inventory cannot be sold, it is difficult for the price of new rubber to rise. According to current predictions, the British-Dutch Rubber Association will definitely decide to suspend tapping on British and Dutch rubber plantations every Sunday or one week per month for the entire year in order to seek remedies. However, it is not daring to predict whether it will have good results. As mentioned earlier, the price of tin has plummeted. Recently, major tin merchants in Sydney, Australia, and tin mining companies in Malaya and Siam managed from Sydney held a representative meeting in Sydney and resolved to propose to all parties a method to save the decline of the tin industry, intending to implement a three-month suspension of mining. Since this issue was reported, Southeast Asia has been shocked. Once mining is suspended, tin miners will suddenly become unemployed. But if mining is not suspended, tin mining companies will inevitably go bankrupt one after another by July, with even greater impact. Overseas Chinese compatriots who have traveled across the ocean, overcoming obstacles to obtain a small piece of land for business, are actually few. Most of them live under the eaves of others, working hard year after year to seek a full meal. Since the price of local products has fallen and the market has been sluggish, the number of unemployed laboring overseas Chinese has increased day by day. Recently, philanthropists have launched a grand plan to repatriate them to their home country. In Singapore alone, over 800 people have registered in less than ten days, which shows the poverty and helplessness of Chinese workers. However, this is only in terms of rubber plantation suspensions. If tin mining is actually suspended, then over 100,000 Chinese miners in Perak will suddenly become unemployed. Workers usually have little surplus funds, so they cannot return home and cannot stay in Nanyang. The tragedy of their situation cannot be described in words. According to reliable investigations, if the price of tin does not rise again, most of the Chinese tin mining companies in the Perak area will definitely go bankrupt, because most of the workers' wages have not been paid. Since the accumulation has been too long, there is no way not to declare bankruptcy. The current situation in Southeast Asia is truly a great crisis for our overseas Chinese compatriots.

<h3 id="e48">South Manchurian Railway Impacted by Silver Devaluation <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The World News Agency reports that, according to Japanese news, the South Manchurian Railway is changing to gold prices due to Chinese railway competition and the sharp drop in silver prices. Its railway freight rates are far higher than those of the Chinese side. On the one hand, the low silver price is conducive to Chinese railway competition. Railway income, which accounts for 50% of the total income of the South Manchurian Railway in this fiscal year (starting August 1), can only decline. As of June 10, the income in these two months and ten days was 17,623,000 yuan, a decrease of 3,913,000 yuan compared with the same period last year, that is, the income in this fiscal year is reduced by an average of 1.2 million yuan per month compared with the same period last year. There is still no turnaround in the future. Moreover, the current slack season has resulted in such a reduction. By the shipping season from October onwards, the reduction will increase further. Therefore, the railway income in this fiscal year will be reduced by about 18 million yuan compared with the seventh fiscal year. On the other hand, coal production has also decreased due to the financial downturn. Only about 1.5 million tons will be exported to Japan this fiscal year, a decrease of about 500,000 tons compared with the previous fiscal year, that is, assuming that the Dalian freight rate is 11 yuan per ton, the income will be reduced by about 5.5 million yuan. In total, the above-mentioned railway reduction of 18 million yuan cannot avoid a reduction of 23 million yuan.</p>

<p>The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference in the Second Conference Hall of the Central Government at 2:00 p.m. on the 26th. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Zhang Tingxiu, the chairman, reported as follows: (1) Recently, due to the high price of gold and the low price of silver, newspapers have been bearing a heavy burden. At the same time, the number of newspapers in various places has been increasing in order to disseminate local news. Therefore, the competition between newspapers is also very fierce. As a result, some have succeeded and some have failed. The Central Propaganda Department believes that the only way to remedy this situation is to concentrate the economic resources of the newspapers. On the one hand, those who want to run newspapers must have a deep understanding and gather together to create several powerful newspapers. This will definitely be effective. The Central Propaganda Department also plans to gather the national press in the short term to discuss a long-term plan to make the newspaper business more and more advanced. (2) Regarding the issue of high gold prices and low silver prices, many opinions have been expressed by all parties. A comprehensive conclusion can be drawn that Chinese people do not need to panic about the high gold prices. In terms of daily life, those who used to use imported goods now have to switch to domestic goods due to the impact of the high gold prices. If this can be maintained, China's industry and commerce will definitely develop. The meeting was adjourned after the report.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Liu Luyin Refutes Rumors in Japanese Newspapers <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Liu Luyin, Acting Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, issued a refutation on the 26th regarding the rumors fabricated by Japanese newspapers, stating that recently, Japanese newspapers have published rumors that are considered by the general public to be the same as those of Shao. In our view, the people of China and Japan should strive for friendship, and Japanese speakers should not publish rumors about China's internal affairs to arouse the resentment of the Chinese people. Those with long-term vision in both countries should understand this clearly. However, recently, Japanese newspapers within China have done the opposite. In our overall view of the records in this type of Japanese newspaper, since the rebellion of Feng and Yan, they have almost only carried rumors created by the reactionaries that are unfavorable to the central government, and have not seen any news of the defeats of Feng and Yan. As for the news of the victories of the Central Army, which is scattered daily in Chinese newspapers, Japanese newspapers do not publish it. This kind of unfair attitude is something that Japanese newspapers, which claim to be impartial in Chinese affairs, should not have. In fact, at the beginning of the Central Government's punitive expedition against the rebels, Feng and Yan publicized how the various reactionary factions were cooperating, while spreading various provocative rumors to the central government. Therefore, what Japanese newspapers in China published was either how unstable the internal affairs of the central government were, or how the front-line generals were fighting for territory. From early March to late April, Chinese Japanese newspapers generally published this type of rumor. After May, after Feng and Yan's rebel army suffered many heavy losses, the rebels felt economically, politically, and militarily exhausted, and wanted to use various tricks to publicize peace in order to shift the situation of a miserable defeat, so they used various tricks to publicize peace. Therefore, the Japanese newspapers in China either published rumors of Zhang Jingjiang issuing a peace telegram, or published rumors of a North-South compromise movement, and at the same time constantly issued false news of the Central Army's general retreat and the wounding of certain important generals, in order to create an atmosphere for the rebel army to hope for peace. Judging from these past facts, Japanese newspapers in China are no different from echoing the propaganda plan set by the rebel side, and have fallen into the situation of being propaganda tools for the reactionary faction. We do not believe that the Japanese newspapers have fallen into this situation because of the intentional actions of all the Japanese newspaper authorities, but no matter what, in fact, Japanese newspapers have invisibly become a tool for the rebel's propaganda plan, which is undeniable. As for a corner of Shandong, in the telegrams of Japanese newspapers, the Jin army was almost going to enter Jinan City every day. In fact, Jinan is a certain distance from the front line of the Jin army. Japanese telegrams can also ignore this. We can hardly find any other explanation for this tireless rumor other than suspecting that Japanese newspapers deliberately intended to arouse domestic public opinion in Japan to advocate sending troops to Shandong. Some time ago, the Shanghai Daily also mistakenly criticized our criticism of Japanese newspapers that published rumors. In fact, the error was the error of those who published rumors, and there was nothing wrong with correcting the publication of rumors. Our purpose in constantly correcting the rumors of Japanese newspapers is to fundamentally eliminate the resentment of the general Chinese people towards Japan caused by these rumors, so that the people of the two countries can find a new friendship of true understanding. What is the benefit of harming the feelings of the other party with rumors every day? We do not easily use the term imperialist to criticize others, but we will regard those who harm the feelings of the people of other countries with rumors every day and are obsessed with it as a kind of imperialist. Moreover, the words and deeds of imperialists do not necessarily correspond to the policies of their own government. For example, the policy of the current Japanese cabinet clearly shows that it does not care about interfering in China's internal affairs and has fallen into the same mistake as the Tanaka cabinet. However, Japanese news reporters or visitors in China may or may not exceed the spirit of their own government's policies. The words and deeds of journalists are a personal matter and have nothing to do with a country's foreign policy. Therefore, it is often the case that a country's foreign policy has been improved, but its foreign journalists still do not change their past wrong attitude. We are not surprised by this. Therefore, the Shanghai Daily wants to prove that the Japanese press in China has no role in spreading rumors or that certain Japanese merchants have no role in assisting the rebel side with the policies of the current Japanese cabinet. There is no sufficient reason.</p>
<h3 id="e60">He Yingqin Arrives in Hunan <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence. He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters, was ordered to come to Hunan to command the various armies to suppress the remnants of Zhang Guitang. He departed from Hankou on the Wanhe steamer of Jardine Matheson at 6:00 p.m. on the 19th and was expected to arrive at the port early on the 21st. Therefore, He Jian, Xia Douyin, He Guoguang, Song Hegeng, Cao Bowen, Chen Changzu, and other party, government, and military officials and representatives of various groups gathered at the Oriental Hotel outside the Great West Gate on the evening of the 20th to wait to welcome him. However, the Wanhe steamer traveled very slowly and did not arrive in Yuezhou until 12:00 p.m. on the 20th. Because it was late at night, it was inconvenient to cross Dongting Lake, so it temporarily stayed in Yuezhou for one night. At 6:00 a.m. on the 21st, it switched from Yuezhou to a warship to come to the province. Because the ship was traveling very fast, it arrived in the provincial river at 2:00 p.m. At that time, there were still two or three hundred people who had gathered at the Oriental Hotel to welcome him. They all stood at the Hong'an Company pier to welcome him. He Yingqin immediately disembarked with his entourage and walked into the Youth Association Provisional Headquarters to rest. Those who came to Hunan with He included Chief of Staff Zhou Weigang, Chief Secretary Liu Jianqun, Senior Staff Officer Yan Daogang, Yu Daoyi, Counselor Wang Shi, Leng Xin, Wang Xuesheng, Head of Aviation Section Cao Shiyi, Head of Liaison Section Tan Qingyuan, Head of Telecommunications Lin Zhiqi, and Adjutant Wang Songzhi, etc., about 80 or 90 people. In addition, there were wireless radio and telephone platoons, etc., who lived in the Great China Hotel area. After He arrived at the Provisional Headquarters, people from all walks of life and news reporters went to visit and inquire about the situation. He Qin made the following statement to all walks of life: [My mission this time is to comfort Commander-in-Chief He and the generals on the front line, and to command the various armies under the order of Commander-in-Chief Jiang to eliminate the remaining rebels of Zhang Guitang. After the remaining rebels of Zhang Guitang were severely attacked by Commander-in-Chief He, they retreated to Xiuxian and Anren. Now our Eighth Route Army is intercepting them near Hengyang and Leiyang. The enemy's retreat has been cut off. Our 49th and 6th Route Armies are again tracking and encircling them, just like catching turtles in a jar. The reason why the rebel army fled to Hunan this time was to take a risk, because they could not survive in Guizhou, so they had to resort to this last resort. Now if they retreat to Guizhou again, not only will the military morale be scattered, but also the ammunition and food will be exhausted. It is expected that they will be annihilated within two weeks. As for the situation of the Central Army's punitive expedition against Yan and Feng, since the start of the war, they have conquered Haozhou, Mamuji, Guide and other places. The Jin army's Sun Chu, Yang Xiaoou and other units have long been defeated. Now there is only Feng's unit left, because there is nowhere to retreat, so they are using the solid fortifications in Zhengzhou and Kaifeng to resist stubbornly. However, Yan and Feng have disagreements. Feng did not rescue the Jin army this time when it failed, so Yan held a grudge against Feng very deeply. Feng is now in a lonely situation. The ammunition is exhausted and the economy is even more difficult. The wounded officers and soldiers have no money for treatment. Now Feng is still deceiving his subordinates, saying that the Guizhou army has arrived in Changsha and can not attack Wuhan in the near future, hoping that his subordinates will defend to the death and wait for rescue. But he does not know that the Guizhou army has now been defeated and fled. Feng will inevitably collapse without a fight when he gets this news. Therefore, the two rebels, Yan and Feng, will be eliminated in the near future. I will temporarily stay in Changsha and prepare to eliminate the Guizhou army in two weeks and then return to Hankou.] The various groups in the provincial capital are planning to hold a meeting at the Provincial Education Association to welcome He, and preparations are currently underway.

He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, was originally scheduled to depart for Zhuzhou early on the 21st to supervise the army and command the various units to pursue the remaining rebels of Zhang Guitang. However, because He Yingqin came to Hunan, it did not happen. On the afternoon of the 21st, He Yingqin arrived in the province and had discussed the future military plan in person. He Yingqin stayed in the province to suppress the army, while He Jian still went to the Zhuzhou and Li Ling front lines to supervise the army, and had already left the province for Zhuzhou by boat at 2:00 a.m. on the 22nd. The provincial party appointed Liu Yinggu, Chief of Staff of the 15th Division, to be responsible for the military affairs of the Fourth Route Army. The provincial government appointed Song Hegeng, Director of the Construction Department, to act on his behalf. Those who accompanied him on the trip all boarded the ship at 12:00 p.m. on the 21st. He Jian, Chief of Staff Guo Chiping, and Secretary-General Liu Pengnian, etc., set off at 2:00 a.m. on the 22nd. At that time, about 1,200 people from all walks of life in the party, government, and military were at the river bank to see them off, which was a grand occasion at that time. The wheel began to move at 2:20. The distribution of ships is as follows: (1) He Jian, Chief of Staff Guo Chiping, Secretary-General Liu Pengnian, Chief of Staff Yang Shisong, Director of Propaganda Ling Zhang, etc., took the Xin Taihe steamer with the Xin Xin tugboat, carrying the first squad of guards.

<p>Agricultural Product Inspection Fee Controversy</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the Guangzhou Agricultural Product Pest Inspection Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining began inspections on the 10th of this month, it has started by detaining goods from seafood merchants and ordering them to pay fees. The Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce sent representatives to the office to negotiate, requesting the release of the goods and a one-week delay. The chamber convened a meeting of seafood merchants and other related merchants on the 18th to discuss the matter, inviting representatives from the office to explain. The office director, Yao Xinghuang, agreed to this. However, various seafood merchants, fearing further detentions as goods continued to arrive from other provinces before the fundamental issue was resolved, wired Hong Kong to halt shipments. Even those already loaded onto ships and arriving in the provincial river were returned to Hong Kong pending resolution.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 18th, at 3 PM, the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce convened a special meeting. Over sixty committee members attended. Huang Jifang from the Guangzhou Agricultural Product Inspection Office and representatives from the municipal party department, Zao Xing, and from the dried fruit and seafood merchant guilds, Liang Ziguang, Yi Zichang, He Hanxuan, Guan Yueshan, Zhu Qiulun, Zhu Ruzhen, and Zhu Shaoming, were present. Yuan Ciming, the chairman, opened the meeting with a formal address, explaining the reason for the meeting. He then invited Huang Jifang, the representative from the Agricultural Product Inspection Office, to explain. Huang stood up and stated that his mission in representing the Agricultural Product Inspection Office was to clarify merchants' misunderstandings about agricultural product inspection. Its purpose can be divided into two aspects: first, to secure equal international trade status for our domestic agricultural products; and second, to prevent the invasion of foreign agricultural product pests. As for the merchants' reporting procedures, they will be made as simple as possible. Agricultural product inspection is a new undertaking in China. Advanced countries in Europe and America have been doing this for a long time. Chinese agricultural products shipped abroad have been repeatedly detained or denied entry entirely because our country lacks agricultural product inspection certificates, preventing us from obtaining equal international trade status. Therefore, to enhance the status of Chinese agricultural products, it is necessary to conduct pest inspections. This also serves to prevent foreign goods with pests from entering. As for the inspection fee, charging one percent of the value is approved by the Executive Yuan, which is significantly less than the twenty percent charged in foreign countries. The procedure is also extremely simple. Hong Kong is a hub for the import of foreign agricultural products. Therefore, to facilitate reporting for various merchants, the office has entrusted the Hong Kong China Xunzheng Company (4th floor of the Hong Kong Trading Building) to handle pest inspection matters according to regulations. All general merchants importing seeds, seedlings, fruits, and aquatic products from abroad must promptly report to this company for inspection and obtain inspection certificates and permits before the goods are distributed to various sub-merchants. Otherwise, the goods will be detained and penalized when transported to the mainland. He hoped that merchants in the city would notify the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce to report and obtain certificates in accordance with this, ensuring smooth transactions. Next, a representative from the seafood merchant guild stated that the government's implementation of agricultural product inspection is a policy to protect agriculture and prevent the invasion of foreign agricultural product pests, which is justified. However, the various merchant guilds have been burdened with heavy taxes and levies in recent years and cannot afford the inspection fees. Moreover, charging one percent of the value is simply unaffordable. Furthermore, the regulations mention inspecting fruits, seeds, seedlings, and aquatic products for pests, but Chinese seafood products are numerous and mostly come to the province from Hong Kong due to distance. If domestic products also need to be inspected, it will be unbearable and inconsistent with the purpose of preventing foreign goods with pests. In addition, the inspection period extends from three days to twenty days. Seafood cannot be delayed, and the losses would be incalculable. Moreover, aquatic products are not within the scope of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining. If inspection is required, it should be handled by the Ministry of Health. Therefore, the guild believes it cannot comply and requests a delay to protect commerce. The inspection office representative reiterated that the inspection time is not a problem, having already explained that the fee is collected and the inspection done in Hong Kong. Once an inspection certificate and permit are obtained, the procedure is complete. When the goods arrive in the province, simply submit the certificate to the office on Guanglou, Changdi, to pick up the goods. As for the request for a delay, it is beyond his authority to answer. The allocation of aquatic products to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining is an administrative matter, and the Executive Yuan has its reasons for assigning it to that ministry. Next, Li Zhuoyu, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, stated that since the inspection office representative has no authority to respond to the points raised by the seafood merchant representative, the seafood merchants and other related merchants should submit their difficulties and reasons for non-compliance in writing to the chamber, which will forward them to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining for consideration. The municipal agricultural product inspection office should delay implementation pending resolution. Next, Zhao Jingru, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, stated that the inspection office representative said that reporting and paying fees through the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce would allow goods to be transported to the mainland. He believed that this was inconsistent with the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining's purpose of inspecting for pests and was primarily aimed at collecting fees, as goods can be transported to the mainland as long as the fee is paid and a certificate is obtained. Furthermore, many domestic agricultural products are transported to the province from Hong Kong. The inspection office staff must have considerable expertise in identifying and testing pests, but whether they can accurately distinguish between domestic and foreign agricultural products without error is questionable. For example, squid produced in Beihai, Xiamen, and Qingdao are domestic products, while those produced in Japan are foreign goods. Can the inspectors distinguish them without error or delay? Also, it must be explained whether the inspection standards are limited to the items listed on the list, permanently valid, and without changes. The inspection office representative replied that the office has specialized testing personnel for pest inspection and is continuing to hire more. The inspection standards are, of course, based on the list and are permanently valid. However, similar items still need to be inspected and fees charged, while dissimilar items may be exempt. Next, Peng Chuli, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, stated that agricultural products are needed by the people, and charging one percent of the value has a significant impact on the national economy. Preventing the entry of foreign agricultural products is a customs policy and not the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining. Since the inspection office representative cannot be responsible for answering, a delay should be requested first, and the various merchants should submit their opinions to the chamber, which will directly forward them to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining to strive for discussion. At this point, the inspection office representative stopped responding, stating that the explanation task was complete and no further discussion was needed. Chamber of Commerce representatives Jiang Zhongya and Huang Yongyu then expressed their hope that the inspection office representative would report the opinions of the various merchants to the director for improvement to achieve mutual benefit and instructed the various merchants to submit their difficulties in writing to the chamber for forwarding to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining to strive for change. Next, a representative from the tobacco merchant guild raised a question, requesting the inspection office representative to answer on the spot, asking whether tobacco is subject to inspection as it is listed in the regulations but not on the list. The inspection office representative replied that although tobacco is listed in the regulations, it has not been determined by the Executive Yuan and is temporarily not subject to inspection. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Gaomi: Japanese Merchants Selling Narcotics <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Civil Affairs Department previously received an order from the Shandong Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee, forwarding a request from the Gaomi County Party Department to devise a method to prohibit Japanese merchants from selling narcotics and transporting firearms. The department instructed strict prohibition. The county magistrate of Gaomi, Miao Dingbao, reported back, stating that there are nine foreign firms established by Japanese in the city, including Gongrong, Tianlong, Hanchuan, Jiushan, Meida, Longchang, Sanda, Jinkang, and Jincheng. The county magistrate had heard of their improper conduct soon after arriving. He immediately ordered the police to closely monitor and strictly prohibit their activities. He also summoned various landlords to inquire about the details. They all claimed that the Japanese were openly using the buildings as foreign firms but secretly selling narcotics, poisoning the people and bullying them. They requested prompt negotiations to order them to vacate the premises in order to maintain sovereignty. Attached was a survey of the addresses of the Japanese firms and the original submissions from various landlords requesting submission of the matter for negotiation. The county magistrate had personally negotiated with the Japanese, but they relied on their power and refused to reason. The magistrate was unable to resort to violent measures. The Civil Affairs Department noted that since Gaomi County is not a treaty port, the unauthorized residence of Japanese merchants and their occupation of civilian houses to sell narcotics violated international conventions. The county magistrate was specifically ordered that, according to the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty, Japanese subjects are allowed to reside and trade in China only at treaty ports. When traveling inland, they must obtain a license from their consulate and submit it to the Chinese local government for stamping. When passing through places, they must present the license for verification before being allowed to proceed. If no license is found or if there is illegal activity, they should be sent to the consulate for punishment. Along the way, they can only be detained, not abused. Since Gaomi County is not a treaty port, the Japanese merchants are audaciously residing there without authorization and occupying civilian houses to sell narcotics, which is a violation of the treaty and laws. In addition to requesting the provincial government to seriously negotiate with the consul, asking him to do his utmost to stop the Japanese people from engaging in such illegal activities again, the county magistrate was ordered to immediately select police officers to detain the illegal Japanese merchants and hand them over to the consul along with the evidence, providing documents nearby, punishing them, and only restricting their freedom along the way, without abuse. All houses should be returned to the original owners, and the detailed handling should be reported. The provincial government had already been requested to seriously negotiate with the Japanese consul.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Harbin Municipal Council Ordered to Reorganize <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Regarding the reorganization of the Harbin Municipal Council, the Governor-General's Office has today ordered the Special Municipal Bureau and the Municipal Self-Government Association to comply. The original order is as follows: [The third re-election of the Harbin Municipal Self-Government Association has caused disputes and lawsuits, which have continued for nearly two months without resolution. The Governor-General's Office has reviewed the points of dispute and, according to the old regulations, finds it difficult to cope, losing both legal and factual grounds. When the Governor-General took office in the 17th year, the second re-election had not yet been completed, and there were various disputes at that time. It was already recognized that many of these regulations should be amended. However, due to the outbreak of the Sino-Russian incident in the middle of last year and the instability of the region, it was not desirable to make changes rashly. Now that the old case has just been settled, a new wave has arisen. Upon weighing the situation, it is believed that there is no other way but to reform. The Governor-General's Office has listed in detail the shortcomings and incompleteness of the regulations and the various facts of this dispute and proposes to suspend the meeting for three months to quickly amend the regulations. During this suspension period, all matters to be handled by the Special Municipal Bureau should be submitted to the Governor-General's Office for approval. Once the new regulations are approved and promulgated, the Self-Government Association should be established in accordance with the regulations and then submit the documents to the bureau for approval. The Northeast Political Affairs Committee instructed that the above issues were presented to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee. The instructions stated that the fundamental cause of this dispute is the incompleteness of the Self-Government Trial Regulations and the failure to establish election and deliberation rules. If they are not fundamentally clarified and redefined, the dispute cannot be resolved. The Governor-General should, in accordance with the National Government's previously promulgated Special Municipal Organization Law, and considering the special circumstances of the region, quickly draft the above regulations and submit them for approval and implementation. Before approval, all matters stipulated in Article 21 of the original Trial Regulations should be temporarily reported by the Municipal Bureau to the Governor-General's Office for approval. Therefore, it should be complied with. In addition to issuing orders for compliance and waiting for the new regulations to be submitted for approval, the bureau and the association are hereby ordered to comply.]</p>
<h3 id="e65">Soviet Russia's Plot to Redden Northern Manchuria <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Three Steps</p>
<p>With a Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Since the Eastern Railway was restored to its original state, the Soviet Union</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>has determined to redden northern Manchuria. The first step is to replace the Russian employees of the Eastern Railway with Soviet personnel who are all party members. Although the power originally held by the director of the Eastern Railway is easy to handle, there are various difficulties. The second step is to use the principle of being close to the ink and the source to redden the Chinese employees with Soviet employees. Although it is slightly more difficult, it will gradually be contaminated and eroded over time. Eventually, it will be achieved, and they will be made to enter the scope of reddening without realizing it. The third step is to have the Eastern Railway employees responsible for expanding propaganda, spreading the red ideology to outside workers, northern Manchurian farmers, and even the proletariat. This is the Soviet Union's great plot after regaining control of the Eastern Railway. It is stipulated that the implementation period is five years, and the director, deputy director, and various department heads of the Eastern Railway, as well as the leaders of each station along the line and the foremen, are responsible for carrying out the plan. The first step is for one year, and the second and third steps are both for two years. According to foreign reports, Director Ludyi recently visited various stations on the east, west, and south lines with the various department heads and secretaries of the railway for inspection. Although it is a routine matter after taking office, the mission he carries is to prepare for the implementation of the first and second steps, instructing the leaders of each station to proceed according to the predetermined plan, depending on the situation, and stipulating rewards and punishments. If significant results are not achieved in the next six months, the responsible leaders will be recorded with demerits and have their salaries deducted. If there are still no results within a year and a half, the responsible leaders will be dismissed and sent back to Moscow for punishment. Conversely, if a certain degree of success is achieved or exceeded within the stipulated period, they will be rewarded or have their salaries increased and promoted. The regulations are very detailed and are generally entrusted to Communist Party Russian members for implementation. All Soviet nationals who are not Communist Party members are not allowed to participate. This is the preparation for the second step. As for the third step, Director Ludyi and Deputy Director Danisov are responsible for carrying it out. The plan is to first dismiss all stateless Russian personnel inside and outside the bureau, and the remaining positions will be completely filled by Soviet Communist Party members. At the beginning of this month, more than eighty of these stateless Russian personnel have been dismissed. The stateless Russian personnel in the railway who have not been dismissed are also afraid that they will not be able to remain in their positions for long. Therefore, they jointly submitted a petition to the Soviet Consulate General in Harbin, which was forwarded to the Soviet government, requesting to join the Soviet nationality in order to preserve their jobs. However, the Soviet government believed that they were speculators with cunning intentions and immediately telegraphed Mei Melnikov, the Consul General in Harbin, ordering him not to allow them to join the nationality and to telegraph Director Lu of the Eastern Railway to dismiss them all. Although the name is to hate their speculation, in fact, they took this opportunity to implement the first step of the reddening of the Eastern Railway plan. At present, there are still more than 300 stateless employees in the Eastern Railway, all of whom are special technicians.</p>
<p>Director Lu had previously sent telegrams to various railways in the Soviet Union to select railway workers who were party members to come to Harbin. When these employees arrive, the fate of the stateless employees is feared to be over. After clearing the stateless employees, the Soviet employees who are not Communist Party members will also be laid off separately, and the total period is completely cleared within one year, all to be replaced by Communist Party members. In addition to replacing all technical positions with ordinary railway workers who have technical skills, the rest are generally supplemented by Communist Party members with military status. This is the Soviet Union's grand conspiracy to redden the Eastern Railway and redden northern Manchuria. The first two steps have been prepared for implementation separately, and the first step is successful as the preparation for the third step. In addition, the Soviet government, in view of the fact that during the Sino-Russian Incident last autumn, most of the Soviet railway workers of the "big radish" type did not comply with the government's strike order and still lingered and refused to leave, so that the Chinese Eastern Railway continued as usual, the Soviet Union was deeply dissatisfied with these railway workers. After the restoration of the Eastern Railway in January this year, the Soviet authorities of the Eastern Railway used a broadsword to implement layoffs and to supplement the real communists one by one so that they could act together to resist us in the event of another incident. It is learned that the Russian deputy director of the Eastern Railway Health Department, formerly Shibeiberg, has been in office for more than three years, has excellent knowledge and rich experience, and recently the Soviet Union suddenly sent Ivanitsky to replace him, which is also one of his retributions.</p>

<p>Difficulties in Interrogation of Prisoners Transferred to Military Prison: The transfer of 30 unsentenced prisoners, including Chen Yi, Lu Yuren, and Xue Hao, from the Jiangsu Third Sub-Prison and the Gaoyuan Detention Center on Sishiqian Street to the Military Prison has aroused a reaction from the Shanghai Lawyers Association and the Wuxian Lawyers Association, which have telegraphed the Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of Justice, and the Supreme Court to dismiss and punish Ding Lei, the director of the three sub-prisons. As of yesterday (26th), the Shanghai Lawyers Association specially appointed lawyers Liu Zuwang and Yu Zonglu as representatives to visit Lin Biao, the president of the High Court in Suzhou, to inquire about the matter. The case falls under judicial secrecy and cannot be announced. Among the unsentenced prisoners who were transferred, Miao Zhuanglin and Xu Jiajin, who were involved in the anti-revolutionary case, happened to be tried by Huang Bingdao, the presiding judge of the Third Criminal Court, at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (26th). At 1:00 p.m., a ticket was signed ordering the bailiff to go to the detention center to interrogate Ding, who also served as the director of the detention center. Ding ordered the warden to bring the two prisoners to the military prison. The warden of the military prison refused to allow the interrogation because the prisoners were detained under the order of the Ministry of Military Affairs and the High Court. The prison was immediately turned over to Huang, the presiding judge of the Third Criminal Court, who stated that each case tried in court was independent and that the unsentenced prisoners were usually detained in the detention center for easy interrogation and should not be held in the military prison, which would cause a barrier. Therefore, the bailiff was ordered to go to the detention center to bring them back, but the trial was not brought back until 4:00 p.m.</p>

<p>The Kidnapping Case in Yixing is Solved in Wuxi: Shi Dancheng's family, residents of Guan Village Township, Yixing, were kidnapped for ransom in February of last year. On the evening of the 23rd of this month, eight kidnappers suddenly came again, beating Shi Dancheng's wife, Zhang, and his younger brother, Danqu, causing injuries. Shi Dancheng's son, Shi Lin'nan, and his cousin, Shi Keshou, were kidnapped. Shi Danqu, who was injured by the bandits, took the Yongxing small steamer from Yixing to Wuxi yesterday morning, intending to seek treatment at the Bingren Hospital. At half past noon, the Yongxing steamer arrived near Luoshe in this county. Shi Danqu glimpsed a bandit ship moored there from the steamer's window. The kidnappers and hostages Shi Lin'nan and Shi Keshou were all on the ship. Danqu immediately shouted, "Lin'nan!" "Keshou!" At that time, more than ten military policemen on the same boat, upon learning the truth, immediately loaded their guns and ordered the steamer's driver to approach the bandit ship to carry out the capture. As a result, they captured one kidnapper, Sun Liubao, and rescued the two hostages, Shi Lin'nan and Shi Keshou. The remaining kidnappers escaped by swimming. One suspect, Zhou Renyun, was also arrested. The steamer then set sail for Wuxi. The military police, together with Qian Tianxiong, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau who was patrolling the wharf, took the kidnapper Sun Liubao, the suspect Zhou Renyun, and the hostages Shi Lin'nan and Shi Keshou to the headquarters of the Second Regiment of Military Police. Wu Chengren, the regiment commander, in order to facilitate linguistic convenience, specifically invited Chief Inspector Qian to hold a court hearing. Sun Liubao confessed that he was from Donghenglin, Changzhou, 25 years old, and made a living by farming. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Zhou Renyun was confirmed to be a law-abiding merchant and was released on bail. Sun Liubao was detained in the regiment headquarters pending transfer to the county for legal proceedings. The injured Shi Danqu went to Puren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>The Labor Dispute at the Deda Yu Silk Factory is Resolved: It has been learned that the employees of the Deda Yu Silk Factory on Jinfeng Road, Zhoushanbang, outside Guangfu Gate in Wuxi, went on strike on the afternoon of the 21st of this month. Ye Qiaoyun and Xu Junjie, the standing members of the Silk Factory Workers' Union and the factory's branch union, respectively, considering that both sides suffered from the stalemate, specially went to Shanghai the day before yesterday with Wang Dingfa, the manager of the Deda Yu Silk Factory, and Wang Yunsheng, the work director, to intercede with General Manager Shi Xingsheng. Ye Qiaoyun and Xu Junjie agreed to instruct all workers to obey the factory's management in the future. As for those who took the lead in causing trouble this time, a thorough investigation and strict punishment should be carried out. General Manager Shi only agreed to resume work after Ye and Xu signed a written guarantee as evidence. That night, Ye Qiaoyun and others returned to Wuxi by car and immediately convened a meeting of the branch union members to report on their trip to Shanghai and urged the workers to go to the factory to work and obey the factory's management. All the workers agreed, and yesterday morning, they all went to the factory to work as usual.</p>

<p>The Consular Body Will Reply This Morning</p>
<p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs Is Determined to Protest to the End</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Company Holds Shareholders' Meeting Today</p>
<p>Various Groups Warned Chinese Shareholders Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the transfer of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company to the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, the National Government's Ministry of Transportation is preparing to buy it back at a price. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also issued a declaration and instructed its Shanghai office to negotiate with the Shanghai Consular Body. The Consular Body also convened a second meeting and decided that the American Consul-General and leader of the Consular Body, Cunningham, would respond. The response was signed last night and sent to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning. Chen Shiguang, director of the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Deputy Director Liu Yunfang visited Mr. Cunningham yesterday afternoon. Cunningham's opinion is that before the National Government takes back the foreign concessions, the Municipal Council remains the administrative organ of the concessions. The telephone issue in the concessions will be decided by the two Municipal Councils and ultimately by the shareholders of the telephone company. Directors Chen and Liu will present the results of the negotiations to Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting. Minister Wang's intention is to protest to the end regardless of the outcome of the telephone company's shareholders' meeting. Chen and Liu also submitted a memorandum to Minister Wang on this issue, advocating that a committee composed of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Transportation be established to handle the matter. The shareholders' meeting of the Telephone Company is scheduled to be held at 4:00 PM today at the Royal Asiatic Society at 5 Museum Road to decide on the sale of the Telephone Company. The various reports heard yesterday are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Letter and Telegram from the Commerce and Industry Reorganization Committee</p>
<p>The Commerce and Industry Reorganization Committee passed a resolution at its 56th Standing Committee meeting, notifying Chinese shareholders to unanimously oppose the sale of the Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company by the Concession Authorities and telegraphed a reply to the Ministry of Transportation. The telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Reply to the Ministry of Transportation's Telegram, Nanjing Ministry of Transportation Junjian. Received your department's telegram of June 24th. The next day, a letter was also received from the city's telephone bureau, transcribing your department's confidential telegram. Under the reading, we have witnessed your department's eagerness to safeguard sovereignty, protect Chinese shares, and the interests of citizens. Therefore, it was submitted to the 56th Standing Committee meeting of the association on June 25th for discussion. It was unanimously agreed that the association has already scheduled a handover and is rushing to conclude all matters. Convening a meeting of all Chinese shareholders is already impossible. It was resolved to publish a notice to inform the Chinese shareholders of the company to unanimously oppose the sale to the International Company. The circumstances of the implementation of the telegram are respectfully reported. We ask your department to review and file the record for public convenience. Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce and Industry Reorganization Committee respectfully bows.</p>
<p>(2) Notice to Chinese Shareholders: Notice regarding the matter of receiving the Ministry of Transportation's telegram, stating that the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company's letter to shareholders and users was published in the Shen and Xin newspapers on the 21st (already seen in this newspaper on the 25th, omitted), etc. It was submitted to the 56th Standing Committee meeting on the 25th of this month for discussion. It was unanimously agreed that the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company and the Concession Authorities, disregarding the interests of Chinese shareholders, privately selling to foreigners, greatly hinders our country's public communication industry, which is different from ordinary buying and selling stores, and shows contempt for sovereignty. The Ministry of Transportation, based on our party's platform and planned policies, is actively preparing to take it back, which is to take care of the interests of the majority of Chinese shareholders and break the monopoly of the foreign directors of the company. All our Chinese shareholders should unite and strive to fight for the Ministry of Transportation to achieve the purpose of taking it back and saving our sovereignty, etc. A notice was issued to all Chinese shareholders to cooperate and insist on the resolution. It is sincerely hoped that all Chinese shareholders will unanimously oppose the sale to foreign merchants. This announcement is made with utmost anticipation.</p>

<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special District Citizens' United Association held an emergency meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company holding a special shareholders' meeting today to sell the special district's telephone business. More than 30 preparatory committee members attended, including Wu Liangsheng, Zhang Zilian, Wu Zhihao, Luo Qinghua, Jiang Xinzhao, Yu Mingxun, Yu Zhongxian, Hu Fengxiang, Yu Yangsheng, Cai Suizhi, Zhang Xianfang, Wang Pingnan, and Lu Qisheng. Zhang Yichen chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, Secretary Yue reported the original texts of the urgent telegram from the Ministry of Transportation and the official letter forwarded by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, requesting serious opposition to the Shanghai Special District Telephone Company's sale of the Special District's telephone business to the International Company and assisting the Ministry of Transportation in formulating measures to take it back as soon as possible. The chairman reported the purpose of convening the emergency meeting today. Then, committee members such as Zhang Zilian, Lu Qisheng, Jiang Xinzhao, Hu Fengxiang, Yu Zhongxian, and Luo Qinghua successively stood up and proposed countermeasures. After discussion, it was concluded that the telephone is a public communication industry, which concerns national sovereignty and the welfare of citizens. It is difficult for the company to sell it to the International Company without authorization. They should represent all citizens and unanimously and seriously oppose it, and jointly work with public groups to implement the recovery measures. Finally, it was decided to take both symptomatic and fundamental measures:</p>
<p>(1) In the name of the association, publish a declaration in Chinese and foreign newspapers immediately, resolutely oppose it, and seriously warn Chinese shareholders and friendly shareholders of the company to express their opposition unanimously. Jiang Xinzhao and Luo Qinghua, two members, were publicly elected to draft the declaration on the spot.</p>
<p>(2) Send a letter to Chen Bingqian and other major Chinese shareholders of the company, seriously requesting them to pay attention and proceed consistently.</p>
<p>(3) The next plenary committee will continue to discuss specific measures and deliberate over the long term. After the discussion, other matters were discussed and adjourned. The attached declaration is as follows (omitted above):</p>
<p>Recently, I read the official announcement of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company that a special shareholders' meeting will be held today (27th) to prepare to accept the International Company's bid and implement the sale of the Special District's telephone service. The telephone is a public communication industry, which is completely different from ordinary buying and selling shops. How can it be sold without authorization? The Ministry of Transportation of the National Government, party headquarters at all levels, and various public groups have successively seriously opposed it and expressed remedial measures. In order to protect our national sovereignty and respect the party's platform, the association convened an emergency meeting on June 26th and unanimously passed a resolution to seriously oppose the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company's sale of the Special District's telephone business and advocate actively taking it back. It is hereby urgently announced that all compatriots of our country who hold shares of the company should respect the law and safeguard sovereignty. Please unanimously refrain from attending the company's special shareholders' meeting today and hope to quickly unite with all Chinese shareholders to actively oppose the company's proposal to show their support for national sovereignty and laws. In case they are blinded by the company and support the sale to foreign merchants, losing national rights and isolating themselves from the public, the association will only represent the citizens of the city to closely monitor and impose appropriate sanctions. Friendly people from all countries who hold shares in the company should also consider the friendly relations between our countries and not violate the feelings of the Chinese people, leading to various unfortunate events. In addition to jointly working with various groups to seek active countermeasures and submitting a request to the government for serious negotiations, the association first publishes this urgent notice in the newspaper due to the urgency of the situation. I hope everyone will pay attention to it. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special City Special District Citizens' United Association.</p>
<p>Public Announcement of Chinese Users</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Chinese Users Association convened a meeting yesterday afternoon at the Bank Club and resolved the following two items:</p>
<p>(1) Send a letter to warn the authorities of the new company that is purchasing at a high price.</p>
<p>(2) Issue a declaration unanimously opposing it. The public announcement is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To the Chinese Shareholders of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company:</p>
<p>Respectfully informing you that the business of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company has never been authorized by the Chinese government and is originally a violation of sovereignty. Now, while our government is preparing to take it back, the company turns a deaf ear and decides to sell it to the International Telegraph and Telephone Company, and the new company has the condition of obtaining a 40-year franchise. This kind of action not only despises our government but also disregards the interests of all our Chinese users. What was the attitude of the former Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company towards our Chinese users and shareholders? I think everyone can remember. This time, the new company actually spent a lot of money to purchase it. The intention is very obvious. May I ask where the interests of our Chinese users and shareholders will be guaranteed in the future? Therefore, we hereby unite and resolutely oppose it. We beg all Chinese shareholders to support national sovereignty and protect public interests. Do not attend the company's special shareholders' meeting on the 27th of this month. Any resolutions of the shareholders' meeting will not be recognized. This statement is hereby made. We hope you will take note of it. Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company Chinese Users Association, June 26th.</p>
<p>Director Zhuang's Remarks</p>
<p>Zhuang Zhihuan, director of the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Transportation, told a reporter from Guowen News Agency yesterday that the Ministry of Transportation has repeatedly written to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since September last year to recover the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company. The Municipal Council initially replied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that it had invited experts to investigate and prepare for improvement, so there was no result. During the recent second company bidding, it suddenly changed its policy and sold the original company. Therefore, the Ministry of Transportation actively opposed it in order to take care of national sovereignty and the interests of the people and advocated that Chinese people buy and operate it. The reasons are:</p>
<p>(1) The telecommunications industry should be state-owned in principle. Chinese companies can also be approved by the government. Now foreign merchants are buying the Chinese-foreign joint venture.</p>
<p>(2) The government and the people are actively recovering the concessions, and the grant of a 40-year patent is deliberately taking advantage.</p>
<p>(3) The interest rate required by the bidding company is too high, which will harm users.</p>
<p>(4) The Nanshi and Zhabei telephones in Shanghai are both operated by the Ministry of Transportation and are connected to the long-distance telephones of Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou, while the telephones in the special district are exclusively operated by foreign merchants, which will inevitably cause many inconveniences in communication.</p>
<p>(5) There are no foreign merchants operating telephones in other places. For example, the telephone in the Tianjin and Hankou concessions is also operated by the Ministry of Transportation. Now the Ministry of Transportation is very willing for Chinese merchants to operate it and does not advocate complete departmental operation. However, the Ministry has already prepared the necessary capital.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Tianjin Customs Affects Shipping <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Almost All Chinese Merchants' Goods Have Stopped Shipping</p>
<p>The Inspector General of Customs, under the order of the National Government, announced that the Tianjin Customs will be considered to be under actual blockade. All import and export duties receivable by Tianjin Customs will be collected by the Jianghai Customs on its behalf, causing great difficulties for the shipping industries in Shanghai. The Chinese merchants' North China liners will formally suspend the Tianjin route. The various news obtained yesterday are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Piece Goods Must Be Taxed</p>
<p>Piece goods merchants in Shanghai urgently need to ship a large quantity of goods to Tianjin. They telegraphed to Tianjin to inquire whether they can pick up the goods in Tianjin based on the red list after the import duty is collected by the Shanghai Customs on its behalf. Yesterday, Tianjin replied that [Quan piece goods and foreign cloth must be inspected and taxed by the customs before they can be unloaded, otherwise they will be detained]. Since yesterday, Chinese merchants' piece goods have completely stopped loading.</p>
<p>Taxable Goods Stop Shipping</p>
<p>Export goods are divided into two types: taxable and tax-free. For example, goods from the Yangtze River that are reported for transit to Tianjin must be taxed when they are transferred to Tianjin from Shanghai. If they have been reported for import in Shanghai, they do not need to be taxed when they arrive in Tianjin. Since the 24th, various North China merchants in Shanghai have agreed to completely stop loading taxable goods to Tianjin due to the loss of double taxation.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Start to Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>After the blockade of Tianjin Customs, the first foreign merchant ships coming to Shanghai from Tianjin include the Japanese ship Chōhei Maru and the British ship Fushun. The ships have already imported. The foreign merchants' goods transported from Tianjin to Shanghai have already been implemented by not paying the standard tax (paid when loaded in Tianjin) and the half tax (paid when arriving in Shanghai) and immediately transferring them to the consulates of various countries for collection on their behalf. Now only foreign merchants' goods are still being loaded as usual between Shanghai and Tianjin.</p>
<p>Extreme Shortage of Goods Going to Tianjin</p>
<p>Since the 24th, the amount of goods going to Tianjin from Shanghai has been unprecedentedly low. Yesterday morning, a British ship exported a total of only 150 tons of goods to Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Tianjin, and the total freight was only 505 taels in gross amount. Another Chinese ship exported only 100 tons of goods to Yantai and Tianjin, and the freight earned was not enough to cover half the cost of coal. The Shanghai shipping industry considers it to be the first time since the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Will All Suspend</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese shipping merchants in Shanghai were discussing that Chinese ships on the Tianjin route have never loaded foreign goods. Now that all the North China merchants have suspended export goods, the liners to Tianjin will be operating empty. Therefore, they decided to suspend the Tianjin route from the next voyage after the ships that have already left return to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting arrived at the North Railway Station at 7:00 AM yesterday morning from Beijing the night before and returned to his private residence on Gu Ba Road to rest. At around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, he went to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Fenglin Bridge to read official documents. Soon, an Englishman, England, went to pay his respects and talked for half an hour before leaving. Wang did not leave the office until 5:30 PM and returned to his residence. Yesterday, French Envoy Wilden, Japanese Deputy Envoy Shigemitsu Aoi, and Norwegian Minister Auberth heard that Wang had come to Shanghai and planned to pay their respects to Wang and discuss important official matters. They successively notified Chen and Liu, the director and deputy director of the Foreign Affairs Office, by telephone to arrange an appointment with Foreign Minister Wang. Wang separately scheduled to receive French Envoy Wilden at 10:00 AM today, Japanese Deputy Envoy Shigemitsu Aoi at 10:30 AM, and Norwegian Minister Auberth at 11:00 AM.

<p>Because Jiang, Zhejiang, and Anhui Bandit Suppression Commander Xiong Shihui did not like to make a big show, he did not hold a ceremony after being appointed. He immediately took office and began planning bandit suppression matters in the three provinces. Before the National Government issued the Jiang, Anhui, and Zhejiang Bandit Suppression Official Seal, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters' official seal was temporarily used as a token. It is now learned that the official seal has been made by the Seal Casting Bureau. The National Government yesterday sent personnel to Shanghai to deliver it to Commander Xiong in Longhua for personal receipt.</p>
<p>Acting</p>
<h3 id="e95">Remarks by Director Tang Naikang of the Municipal Finance Bureau <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Xu Fu, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, resigned and was approved. The municipal government appointed Counselor Tang Naikang to act as the successor. The news was reported in yesterday's newspapers. Reporters from various newspapers visited Mr. Tang at the municipal government yesterday and asked him about the date of taking over and the financial policy to be implemented. According to Mr. Tang, I have very little experience in financial management and I am afraid that I will not be able to win the job. Since receiving the order, I have repeatedly resigned to Mayor Zhang, but I have not been invited to approve it. I reluctantly agreed to act as an agent temporarily until a suitable candidate is found. Moreover, Director Xu has organized the financial affairs of this city in an orderly manner and has achieved remarkable results. I uphold the principle of following Xiao's rules and Cao's legacy and take the four words of diligence, prudence, integrity, and cleanliness as the purpose of handling affairs. All financial revenues and expenditures are open so that citizens can understand the financial situation of the city and supervise it. Since the news of my acting as the Director of the Finance Bureau spread, many people have recommended talents. However, the Municipal Finance Bureau has been established for three years and the internal staff are all experienced. Moreover, I am only acting temporarily and it is not convenient to make many changes. Although there are virtuous people, there is no way to recruit them. I hope that all circles will forgive me for this point. As for the date of taking over, according to Mr. Tang, because Director Xu will soon hand over, it is planned to go to the Finance Bureau on July 1st to take over.</p>
<p>Tang Naikang</p>

<h3 id="e97">Careful Discussion of the County Budget <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Details of the Discussion on Reassessing Land Prices</p>
<p>The circumstances of the Shanghai County Government's discussion on reassessing land prices the other day were briefly reported in the newspapers. Now, the detailed investigation is recorded below. This time, the Jiangsu Provincial Government vigorously implements budget preparation. The Shanghai County Government and its subordinate bureaus and agencies are also striving to economize to ensure that the budget is established so that county administration can be carried out on the right track. For the past two weeks, it has been carefully planned. However, the county area is too small and the income is too short. After economizing, it is still not enough. At that time, the county government received a report from Huang Meixian, director of the county agricultural farm, stating that the farm's expenses were not covered and requested that agricultural improvement donations be collected. However, the previously assessed land price was too low. According to regulations, it cannot be increased by more than one percent of the land price. However, the average land price in Baoshan is more than 116 yuan per mu, and Songjiang is 110 yuan. Shanghai is adjacent, but the price per mu is only 100 yuan, which is too low. Therefore, he requested that it be reassessed. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Yan believed that it was undesirable to increase the burden on the people when the people's strength was difficult. However, the county budget could not be reduced and was indeed a fact. The county administration could not proceed, and the people who were directly harmed were still the people. Therefore, after careful consideration, he submitted this report to the last county administration meeting for public discussion. It was heard that the meeting decided to convene a meeting of various agencies and public groups the day before yesterday for discussion. It was heard that at the meeting that day, everyone recognized that the budget deficit was a real situation. If the budget is to be established, another method must be found to raise funds. However, some opinions believe that it would be better to find another method other than increasing taxes. Therefore, the result of the vote that day was that the votes in favor and against were the same at six votes. According to the common practice in the venue, the chairman should participate in the opinion to make a decision. However, Chairman Yan believed that this case was not a common case. Matters related to the burden on the people should be discussed in detail and the public opinion of local people should be respected. Therefore, he would rather retain this right and resubmit it to everyone attending the meeting for public discussion and request them to express specific opinions.</p>
<p>(1) If the expenses listed in the proposal are deemed to be reducible, please submit the items and numbers for discussion and decision, and the county government can do so as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) If it is deemed that it cannot be reduced any further, if there are other stable and legal methods of raising funds other than increasing taxes, please submit them for discussion. At that time, everyone attending the meeting had different opinions. It was generally believed that it was impossible to reduce the various expenses. Since it was getting late, the chairman decided to postpone the meeting until today (27th) at 1:00 PM for public consideration.</p>
<p>Content of the Proposal</p>
<p>The director of the County Agricultural Farm submitted a proposal to reassess land prices for public decision.</p>
<p>(1) Reasons for the Farm's Proposal</p>
<p>The farm's original expenses were subsidized by the province by 1,212 yuan per year, which was only one-third of the original budget. Now, the provincial subsidy has also been ordered by the department to stop allocating funds from July, resulting in no funds. If it is stopped immediately, the previous achievements will be abandoned. It is found that the average land price assessed this time is 100 yuan per mu. In fact, the total average land price in the county exceeds 100 yuan. Therefore, it is requested to reassess it and collect agricultural improvement donations as a precedent to maintain the farm's expenses.</p>
<p>(2) Opinions of the County Government</p>
<p>It is found that the county previously ordered the legal groups and farmer representatives to assess the land price on April 3rd in accordance with the order of the Finance Department and has not yet received instructions for approval. Therefore, the county's land price has not yet reached a certain period. Reassessing it is not impossible. According to the provincial gazettes, the average price of farmland in neighboring Baoshan County (Gazette No. 455) is 116 yuan per mu, and the average price of farmland in Songjiang (Gazette No. 457) is 110 yuan per mu. The price of farmland in this county should not be much lower than that of Baoshan and Songjiang. However, the average price assessed last time was only 100 yuan per mu, which is a big difference and should be discussed. In terms of taxation, it is better to keep the evaluation low for the sake of the current people's strength. If we consider the future land consolidation and collection for public use, then it is not good to be too low. It is necessary to consider both. It is found that the county has not many expenses for various undertakings. Now, the ones that can be slightly listed in the rushed budget for the 19th year (A. Party Affairs Expenses) have no funds at all and are temporarily transferred from provincial funds. It is difficult to transfer them again in the 19th year. According to regulations, this item requires a regular annual fee of 14,400 yuan, not including temporary expenses and mass organization expenses. (B. Autonomous Expenses) According to regulations, the district office expenses are 9,589 yuan short per year in addition to the original expenses. Even if the reduction is paid, at least 5,600 yuan must be raised. Although the township chiefs and village chiefs are volunteer positions, the office expenses are not named and it is difficult to handle all matters. This should also be planned for. (C. Farm Expenses) If there is no way to raise funds, then there is no choice but to stop it. (D. Charitable Relief Undertakings) There are many urgent matters to be handled but there is no way to handle them. It is also impossible to raise funds without lifting them. All of these major needs have been huge, and it is not easy to collect the funds without collecting them. If the land price is used as a percentage, such as the land price assessed according to the original evaluation, it will be difficult to levy it. The above-mentioned items cannot be resolved, and the budget for the 19th year will not be able to be compiled. This is related to the requirements of the budget. It is extremely important to reassess the land price and add a levy. Local undertakings cannot be stagnated, and increasing taxes will increase the burden on the people. It is difficult to take care of both. However, the expenses for undertakings that must be held must be planned in advance. Otherwise, it is still the burden of the people to dig wells when they are thirsty, or it will increase the invisible loss or take it harshly, which will only cause disputes. Rather than collecting scattered funds temporarily, which is also a burden on the people, it is better to collect taxes from farmland and turn the scattered into the whole. Therefore, for the farm's proposal and the needs of various undertakings, we still advocate adding a levy. Adding a levy must first determine the land price. This is the hope that the reassessment of the land price will be carefully explored and an appropriate solution can be obtained. This is the happiness of the future of local undertakings.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Baoshan County Government Budget Meeting <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Baoshan County Chief Qiu Mingjiu convened a meeting of personnel from various agencies in the county government's assembly hall at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the 19th-year budget. County Chief Qiu, acting as chairman, reported on the approved levy of eight fen per mu of land. He then discussed the methods of allocation based on the actual revenue status of the 18th year, discounted by 88%.</p>
<p>(1) Yuan Guanlan and others requested that the grain storage fee be allocated from the eight fen per mu levy. It was unanimously decided to establish the case.</p>
<p>(2) It was unanimously decided to approve the proposal to allocate two fen from the grain storage fee, as originally requested.</p>
<p>(2) It was decided how to allocate funds for establishing a relief home, a smoking cessation center, and reorganizing the clinic. It was decided to allocate 1,000 yuan to the relief home for orphans and 1,000 yuan to the smoking cessation center attached to the medical clinic.</p>
<p>(3) It was decided to allocate 200 yuan to the county government gazette.</p>
<p>(4) It was decided to allocate 400 yuan to the party headquarters' temporary expenses.</p>
<p>(5) It was decided how to allocate funds for township and town offices and district projects. (1) 4,716 yuan was allocated to township and town offices (calculated at 3 yuan per month per office for 131 offices). (2) 3,000 yuan was allocated to district offices for project expenses (calculated at 50 yuan per month per district for five districts).</p>
<p>(6) It was decided to subsidize 1,000 yuan annually to address the insufficient funding of the registration bureau.</p>
<p>(7) The chairman proposed that, based on the actual collection situation, only 40% of the revenue could be collected in the first year. It was decided that the above-mentioned allocation amount was calculated based on the actual revenue status of the 18th year, discounted by 88%. In the future, if the full 88% could not be collected, it was decided that the shortfall should be proportionally allocated based on the actual revenue status and that the audit committee should conduct further estimation and review when preparing the 19th-year budget.</p>
<p>(8) It was decided to nominate the following members for the 19th-year budget audit committee: (1) Yuan Jietai, Director of the Finance Bureau; Wang Zhongqi, Director of the Property Department; Xue Ying, Section Chief of the Second Section of the County Government; Yin Shuqi, Director of the Registration Bureau; Lu Fengbo, District Chief of the Second District; Wang Cheng of the Education Bureau; and Zhang Jingshi of the County Party Headquarters. (2) If there were any changes to the budgets of various agencies, they should be submitted to the Finance Bureau before the 27th of this month. (3) It was decided to hold an audit meeting at 3:00 PM on the 29th of this month, convened by the Finance Bureau. All audit committee members should attend the county government meeting on the 30th to report.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Wang Prepares to Post Bail</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association representatives, Gu Angruo and Xia Boxun, visited Commander Xiong at the Longhua Headquarters yesterday afternoon to inquire about the truth of Zhang Sixu's detention. Commander Xiong received them cordially and replied that Zhang Sixu's detention was an order from Nanjing and not the intention of the Songhu Garrison Command. The reason for this could not be announced at the moment. Commander Xiong further said that he greatly appreciated Zhang's English knowledge and that Mr. Zhang was a talented person in the journalistic field. He added that there was no danger in his detention, but he was being isolated from the outside world to stop his activities. Commander Xiong also instructed his secretary, Wang Zhiwen, to inform the military law office to give Zhang special treatment. Gu and Xia then went to the military law office to see Councilor Chen and Judge Advocate Dai. They both agreed that Zhang was a scholar and had moved Zhang to a special room with preferential treatment. Dai also allowed Gu and Xia, as well as Zhang's wife, to meet with Zhang. Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting is prepared to post bail to Commander Xiong for Zhang Sixu to be transferred to the custody of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Minister Wang instructed Liu Yunfang yesterday to represent him in this matter. Mr. Liu is scheduled to visit Commander Xiong this morning. Minister Wang is also willing to guarantee Zhang Sixu's future actions in writing. Zhang's wife, as well as Powell, the editor of the "Millard's Review," and Li Cai, the president of the "National News Agency," are also making every effort to rescue him. It is expected that Mr. Zhang will be released soon. Japanese Marines</p>

<p>Responsible for Reporting Within Three Days</p>
<p>During the previous general meeting of the Red Cross, some people organized thugs to disrupt the meeting place and destroy the general office. The National Government then telegraphed Shanghai Mayor Zhang and appointed Health Bureau Director Cha Fushe to investigate and respond. In accordance with the National Government's instructions, the matter should be reported by the chairman of the board of directors of the office. The Director of the Health Bureau then informed the chairman of the board, Wang Peiyuan, to comply. Yesterday, Wang Peiyuan replied to the Health Bureau, but the wording was vague and did not comply with the decree. Therefore, a letter was sent to Chairman Wang, urging him to strictly comply and respond to the original letter, stating that in the disturbance at the previous Red Cross general meeting election site, and the destruction of the Red Cross general office, there were traces of connection to the re-election. At that time, an effort was made to investigate the instigators and perpetrators in order to prosecute them according to law, but so far there has been no clue. We are still making every effort to investigate, and as soon as clear evidence is obtained, we will proceed with legal procedures. It is also heard that many representatives and members have submitted petitions to the National Government, begging them to forward requests for urgent investigation. Upon investigation, according to the facts and reasons stated in the previous order, the chairman of the board of directors of the general office should be responsible for reporting. Upon reviewing the reply letter from your chairman, the wording is ambiguous and there is no fact of taking responsibility for reporting. Moreover, the claim in the letter that dozens of people suddenly came with weapons at the time of the vote counting in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, claiming that the ballots must be cancelled and a re-election held, Peiyuan replied that this was a matter for the general meeting and could not be answered at this moment, and the crowd roared for a long time before leaving. It is clear that your chairman had a close conversation with the thugs who were disrupting the meeting at that time, and it cannot be said that he did not know the instigators and helpers of the disruption and had no way to report them. It is also said that the disruption of the meeting place and the destruction of the general office are related to the re-election, but no one has been held responsible for reporting the disruption. The re-election committee had been working in your general office and had used the general office seal to issue notices. Moreover, your chairman and office staff Wei Ruifeng, Wu Yaosan, and Shen Jintao had served as members of the re-election committee until the Red Cross Standing Committee resolved to postpone the general meeting of members' representatives for three months before announcing their withdrawal from the re-election committee. It can be seen that your chairman and others were also closely connected with the side advocating for re-election. Since it is recognized that the disruption of the last election of the Red Cross and the destruction of the general office were all related to the re-election, then who instigated it? Who helped? There must be some knowledge. Why not take responsibility for reporting them in order to be sanctioned, but instead make ambiguous statements and say that the investigation has yielded no clues so far? It is the responsibility of your chairman to love the Red Cross, and he must be second to none in protecting the Red Cross from illegal infringement. He should break through feelings and have no scruples, and take responsibility for reporting in order to be able to present the facts separately and await legal sanctions and administrative punishments. It is still hoped that you will check the previous letter and respond truthfully within three days in order to comply with the decree and report this reply.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Proposals for the Committee to Promote Cholera Prevention <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Cholera Prevention Propaganda Committee held its eighth regular meeting yesterday. After Chairman Ke Mizawa opened the meeting, each representative reported on the promotion and supervision of cholera prevention injections by their respective organizations last week.</p>
<p>(1) Yan Sen, representative of the Health Bureau, reported that a total of 166,217 people had received free cholera prevention injections from May 1st to June 24th, and that free injections were currently being promoted in various vegetable markets and on the water.</p>
<p>(2) The representative of the Public Security Bureau reported that orders had been repeatedly issued to all districts to earnestly take charge of supervising and urging people to receive injections.</p>

<p>(1) The committee was asked to discuss the reply from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration stating that advertising inside the carriages would be charged according to regulations, but that the cholera prevention illustrations could be charged at half price due to their public welfare nature. It was decided to reply to the railway administration that this matter was entirely of a public nature and that the display of posters encouraging cholera prevention was by no means comparable to commercial advertising. Moreover, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau also provided free cholera prevention injections, so it was requested that the posters be displayed free of charge to facilitate public awareness and emphasize epidemic prevention.</p>
<p>(2) A proposal was made to commend Yong'an Silk Factory, Weitong Yarn Factory, British American Tobacco Company, Shanghai Middle School, and other factories and schools for their excellent results in supervising and urging their workers or students to receive free cholera prevention injections. It was decided that the committee would send letters to each factory and school to express its appreciation for their concern for the health of their workers or students.</p>
<p>(3) A proposal was made to commend Cao, the head of the fourth precinct of the fifth district of the Public Security Bureau, for his extraordinary efforts in assisting with the supervision and urging of people to receive free cholera prevention injections. It was decided that the committee would send a letter to the Health Bureau, requesting that it, at the end of this round of preventive injections, refer to the regulations for rewarding and punishing the Public Security Bureau's various districts and branches for assisting with health administration and send a letter to the Public Security Bureau to reward them.</p>
<p>(4) A proposal was made to adjust the date of the committee's regular meetings. It was decided that the committee would meet once every two weeks on Wednesday afternoon at 2:00 PM during the second week. If there were any urgent matters, the Health Bureau representative would issue a notice to convene an extraordinary meeting.</p>

<p>Wuhu Invited All Circles to Visit Yesterday</p>
<p>Tonghua Escaped Danger: The Merchant Shipping Bureau's Haizhou liner Tonghua ran aground at Dapu. After ten days, the bureau sent a machine to Dapu to dig out the sand and mud from the third hold of the Tonghua. The ship was successfully towed out during high tide on the 25th. Yesterday, the ship telegraphed that it had arrived in Haizhou and was unloading cargo. The hull was undamaged, and the cargo was safe. It is expected to return to Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<p>Wuhu to Start Service: The Taikoo Company's newly built Shanghai-Xuancheng liner Wuhu is fast and has excellent passenger accommodations. Since arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 24th, the ship docked at the company's wharf on the Bund outside the French Concession yesterday afternoon. The ship's grand dining room is located on the upper deck, and the officer and steerage cabins are beautifully arranged on the second deck. It is truly the best on the Shanghai-Yixing route. Shanghai to Xuancheng takes eight days. A seat in the grand dining room costs eighty yuan, an officer's cabin costs fifty yuan, and a steerage cabin costs only fourteen yuan and ten cents. The maiden voyage will start this morning. Yesterday, all circles were invited to visit. Those who attended included Yu Qiaqing, Sun Meitang, Yuan Ludeng, Yue Zhenbao, Chen Fenggang of the Sichuan gang, Liu Bingyi, Tang Bomou, managers of various customs brokers, and reporters from various newspapers, totaling several hundred people. Many British and Japanese people also attended. Chen Xuejia, the company's Chinese manager, Yang Shaonan, the head of the navigation department, and staff members Chen Kangqi and Dong Zhichu warmly welcomed the visitors. The ship is made entirely of steel, has a deadweight of 1,800 tons, and is very fast, traveling 14 nautical miles per hour. Both passengers and cargo are fully booked for the initial voyage.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Rice Price Rises to Twenty-Four Yuan <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the price of rice has been rising daily due to the scarcity of goods arriving from various places. The actual black market price of first-class white rice has risen to twenty-four yuan per dan. Although the Social Affairs Bureau has issued restrictions, it is impossible to suppress the price. The reason for this is that the amount of rice arriving from the rice-producing areas is decreasing due to various factors such as weather and human affairs, resulting in a shortage of supply and a demand that cannot be met even with high prices. Moreover, the import prices of foreign rice such as Laimai and Ximai have also risen to around eighteen yuan. It is impossible to control the price of rice. There is a risk of a rice shortage forming in a month or two.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Yesterday's News on the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession water and electricity workers' strike is gradually expanding and is difficult to resolve. At 3:00 PM yesterday, the entire union held its fourth general meeting of all members at the Public Stadium. The Municipal Party Headquarters still sent Xu Yefu to attend and provide guidance. The Second District Headquarters of the Public Security Bureau sent police to maintain order. Chairman Xu Amei reported that the factory continued to stubbornly hire White Russians to work and that the company had still made no offers.</p>
<p>As reported yesterday, trams in the British and French Concessions cannot directly reach each other. However, the French Concession only blocked trolleybuses routes 14, 17, and 18 and not completely. Starting yesterday, the five tram routes connecting the British and French Concessions also remained closed.</p>
<p>Since the workers' strike began, the factory has suffered a lot of damage to its machinery. Although White Russians have been hired to repair it, it is still insufficient. It is reported that the factory once consulted the British Concession Tram Company, intending to ask the British factory workers to come to the French factory for repairs. The British factory foreman then sought the opinion of the British factory union, but they did not give their permission. Therefore, at around 10:00 AM yesterday, the British factory union sent two representatives to the French factory union to declare their refusal to help the French factory in order to express their spirit of mutual assistance. All the workers in the French factory union were very grateful upon hearing this.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Important News from the Relief Committee Office <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Relief Committee previously advertised to solicit donations of medical supplies for the Guide battlefield and for emergency relief in Shaanxi and Henan provinces. The response from all sectors of society has been enthusiastic. The first batch of received medicines has been packed and sent by special envoys to Guide for distribution. The committee office has also received 10,000 packets of Longhu Brand Rendan and 2,000 bottles of Shi Yi Shui donated by Mr. Huang Chu Jiu, and 30 boxes of Sha Yao Shui donated by Mr. Cheng Linsheng. In addition, there are many other medicines donated by various households. The committee plans to send a second batch to Shaanxi and Henan provinces for emergency relief. In recent days, the two provinces have repeatedly sent telegrams of appeal. At this time of year, when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest is not yet in, every donation can save a life. The Stock Exchange Federation recently donated 1,000 gold pieces and deeply hopes that all sectors of society will treat disaster relief as they would put out a fire. Let's save lives with gold today and gather small amounts to make a large sum. It is heard that the committee will remit the accumulated amount to Zhu Ziqiao, the representative in the Beijing office, to personally distribute the funds.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Huang Huiru Appears <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Is It True or False?</p>
<p>Doubt Upon Doubt</p>
<p>Huang Huiru, of the Huang-Lu case, has been silent for a long time. Recently, it was rumored in Suzhou that Huang Huiru had not died and was hiding in Suzhou. Although the reporter found the rumor incredible, the details were strange. Therefore, yesterday (26th), the reporter went to the residence of Huang Zhu at No. 23 Xizhi Lane, Daoqian Street, Xumen in Suzhou to find out the truth. However, the door was closed, and there was no way to enter. So the reporter asked the nearby neighbors if they had seen Huang Huiru. According to a neighbor, there was indeed a young lady in the Huang residence who looked similar to the Huang Huiru described in previous reports, only slightly thinner. Recently, the young lady has been sick from time to time and has been treated with medicine, but has now recovered. Every day at 5 or 6 pm, she opens the door and stands. If a neighbor looks at her, she turns around and goes inside. Although the reporter cannot be sure that it is Huang Huiru, there must be a reason for the rumor, so it is recorded here for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Monk Castrates Himself <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Disgusted by Other Monks' Unclean Roots</p>
<p>To Declare His Innocence</p>
<p>Yu Xinfa, a 29-year-old from Hubei, was forced into a temple as a monk when he was young due to the death of his parents and the villainy of others. Last year, he came to Shanghai from his hometown and joined the Pushengtang at 36 Hujia Muqiao. He usually recites scriptures, worships Buddha, and strictly abides by the rules, so he is quite favored by the abbot. However, there are still several monks in the hall who cannot abide by the rules because their six roots are not clean, and they regard prostitution and whoring as commonplace. Yu was very disapproving and tried to persuade them, but his words were ignored. Yesterday afternoon, Yu once again encouraged his colleagues, which was met with ridicule from the monks, who slandered him as a hypocrite. Yu was displeased when he heard this and made a vow in public. To declare his innocence, he grabbed a kitchen knife, pulled down his trousers, and cut off his testicles, causing profuse bleeding. The monks quickly grabbed the knife and reported to the Fifth District Third Precinct, ordering the police to come and hire a car to take him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, Yu's life is still in danger.</p>
<p>Two Bandits in Kidnapping Case</p>
<h3 id="e110">Still Sentenced to Death After Retrial <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Ma Jiyuan, a Henan native who previously served as a patrolman, and Liu Fuxing, a Suzhou native, repeatedly committed kidnappings of Chen Xiaofu, Xu Fusun, Ye Daming, and others in the past two years. They were arrested by the Jing'an Temple patrol and handed over to the former Provisional Court for questioning. They were sentenced to death and submitted to the higher authorities for review. Recently, an order was received to send the case back for retrial due to some doubts in the case. The Special District Local Court judge Sun Yuan reissued summonses for witnesses and researched the case of Ma and Liu. Yesterday morning, the verdict was announced: Ma Jiyuan and Liu Fuxing should be sentenced to death for their kidnapping and extortion, and deprived of their public rights indefinitely. After the sentencing, the patrolmen took them back to the Western Prison to await execution after confirmation.</p>
<p>Ge's Banxia Store</p>
<h3 id="e111">Inheritance Case Awaiting Sentencing <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Debate Concluded</p>
<p>Ge Fengyuan's lawyer, Ge Fengyuan, hired Wu Zhiping and Ye Fukang as lawyers in the local court to sue his great-grandmother Ge Xu and his cousin Ge Jimei for infringement. He asked for the case to be filed and judged, stating that the plaintiff's uncle Yanting Gong was the first defendant. Ge Xu's eldest son, Min Ba, died without children, only a married daughter, Ge Jimei, the second defendant. With the approval of the plaintiff, the first defendant signed a succession agreement in May of the 18th year, choosing the plaintiff as Yanting Gong's heir. All property, except the house at No. 137 Lindun Road in Suzhou, was gifted to the second defendant. The remaining residential building at No. 507 Lindun Road in Suzhou, as well as the Ge Lao Er Fang Yu Qing Tang Banxia store in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Ningbo, will forever be jointly owned by the plaintiff and his cousin Fenghua. The succession was determined, and lawyer Lu Hongyi arrived at the scene to prove the matter and requested the Wu County Local Court to file and approve the agreement and publish a notice to the family. Unexpectedly, the second defendant was still not satisfied and dared to ask the first defendant to privately write a document transferring the already analyzed and determined Shanghai Banxia branch store to the second defendant, and asked the court to approve the record. Therefore, the plaintiff requested to revoke the document and take back the management himself, demanding that the transfer document be declared invalid and order the Shanghai Ge Lao Er Fang Banxia store to be returned to the plaintiff for self-management.</p>
<p>The Defendants' Response: The defendants, Ge Xu and Ge Jimei, hired Zhao Chuanding and Lu Congzu as lawyers to submit their responses. Jimei's defense briefly stated that the plaintiff claimed that the Shanghai Ge Lao Er Fang Yu Qing Tang Banxia Pharmacy had been recorded in the succession agreement as jointly owned by the plaintiff and his cousin Fenghua. Regardless of whether the succession agreement is recognized by the defendant's grandmother, the agreement is indeed suspicious in practice. For example, the Nanjing Ge Lao Er Fang Banxia store was established by the defendant after the death of the defendant's father, which the grandmother knew and would never have recorded it. Furthermore, there are still Yanting Gong's estates that are not recorded in the succession agreement. If the property division method in the succession agreement was the grandmother's intention, why would there be omissions? Also, the house at No. 137 Lindun Road in Suzhou was sold by the grandmother to the Zhang family in the same area as early as 1927. How could the grandmother not know this and still record it in the succession agreement? Furthermore, the advertisement in the Shanghai News and Suzhou Xiaobao on June 6, 1929, issued by lawyer Lu Hongyi on behalf of Ge Xu and Fengyuan, only stated that Fengyuan was chosen as Yanting Gong's heir to inherit the family lineage, and did not mention a single word about the estate division. Moreover, the defendant is Yanting Gong's only biological daughter, so why was she not notified in advance? In summary, it can be proved that the records in the succession agreement were not from the grandmother's own intention. Therefore, the grandmother's separate writing to return the management rights of the Shanghai pharmacy, which had already been inherited and obtained, to the defendant is fundamentally legal and does not involve the slightest infringement. As for the Shanghai Banxia store, Yanting Gong had said before his death that he would give it to the defendant to inherit, and when Yanting Gong was buried in 1919, because there were no biological children or heirs, the entire family agreed that the defendant would serve as the filial child and inherit the property. The children and grandchildren of the same family are all beyond the fifth degree of mourning (the defendant's father's branch has been transmitted alone for nine generations), and according to the law, there is no provision that disallows a biological daughter from inheriting the property. When the National Army arrived in Jiangsu in 1927, the defendant's inheritance of Yanting Gong's property as an unmarried daughter became even more fixed. The plaintiff's claim began in May 1929, at which time the property of the Shanghai Ge Lao Er Fang Yu Qing Tang Banxia store had already been obtained by the defendant through inheritance. If the so-called succession agreement did stipulate the division method of the Banxia store, the most unauthorized disposition would be invalid under the law and could not allow the plaintiff to interfere. In summary, the inheritance of the family lineage and the inheritance of property are two separate matters, and the inheritance of property by a woman and the inheritance by an heir are not mutually exclusive. Now, the plaintiff's claim to the estate, which had already been inherited and obtained by others, under the status of an heir who has not yet been determined, is extremely absurd and should be dismissed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the case continued to be heard. Zeng Feng opened the court to hear the case, but it was not concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo Shouyi specially opened the Second Court to continue the hearing. Both parties, along with their lawyers, were present in court. The plaintiff Ge Fengyuan stated that his great-grandmother Ge Xu was blind, so the signature on the succession was done by Xu Xiaofeng. The judge asked how old Fenghua was, and the reply was seven years old, and it was Wang Zhimei who helped him sign. The judge asked if Jimei was present at the signing, and the reply was no. The judge asked why not, and the reply was because the house had already been given to her, so she was not present. The judge questioned Ge Jimei, who claimed that the Nanjing store was established with her investment. The judge asked Ge Xu if Xu Xiaofeng helped her sign, and the reply was yes, but they were holding my hand. The judge asked why she did not publish a statement, and the reply was that she only knew about the succession agreement and nothing else. The judge asked Ge Fengyuan if anyone had mediated outside, and the reply was no. The judge then announced the start of the debate, with the lawyers of both parties debating for a long time. The judge announced the conclusion of the debate and adjourned to await sentencing.</p>
<p>China Youth</p>
<h3 id="e112">Farewell Banquet for the Asia Walking Tour Group <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Youth Asia Walking Tour Group, which is scheduled to depart on the 28th of this month, was given a grand farewell banquet yesterday noon at Jue Yuan, No. 19 Hart Road, by prominent figures from all walks of life in Shanghai. In addition to the eight members of the group, including the group leader Li Mengsheng, Feng Binghun, Hu Sujuan, Cui Xiaoqiong, Huang Yue, Qiu Langming, Chen Wu, and Wang Xiahun, the attendees included Ye Gongchuo, Master Taixu, Ge Gongzhen, Liao Maoru, Zhao Jinqing, Chen Binhe, Shao Yizhi, Chen Bofan, Lin Liehfu, Zheng Zhizhong, Guo Xiqi, and Shao Woyun. First, Ye Gongchuo gave a lengthy lecture, the gist of which was that walking is the greatest of actions, but only by setting a goal and being down-to-earth can one achieve final success. After speaking, he personally inscribed the words "Courageous and Vigorous Progress" for the group. Next, the newspaper reporters took photos, and then everyone took their seats. The first speaker was Ge Gongzhen, who encouraged the group to proceed steadily, listen more and talk less, and keep records at all times and in all places. Next, Lin Liehfu gave a speech, the gist of which was that walking is the best way out for Chinese youth. Japanese people travel extensively within China every year, while Chinese people are living in a drunken stupor. We should catch up quickly. Finally, Huang Jingwan delivered a farewell speech, encouraging the group to strive forward, explore through walking, seek knowledge in practice, promote culture, connect feelings, urgently seek the liberation of weak nations, and advocate the organization of a Nanyang federation. Next, the leader of the group gave a thank-you speech, the gist of which was to state that the group's goal is to observe the lives of various ethnic groups at all times and in all places, with the whole world as one university, to keep walking tirelessly, and to have absolutely no political background, hoping to give Chinese youth a profound impression. After the banquet, Master Taixu also inscribed a text as a farewell gift. Newspaper reporters took many photos and presented the group with various books, magazines, and printed materials. The gathering ended happily at 4 p.m. The group is scheduled to gather at the North Station at 10 a.m. tomorrow to depart.</p>

<p>The ship and cargo were completely lost.</p>
<p>The crew was rescued by the Guangji.</p>
<p>The merchant ship Guangji of the China Merchants Bureau rescued three sailors from a capsized sailing ship in the waters off Wenzhou while sailing from Shanghai. The news is reported as follows:</p>
<p>The Guangji found a sailing ship in distress off Daiman Mountain. On the 21st, the Guangji sailed from Wenzhou to Shanghai and discovered a capsized sailing ship in the waters off Daiman Mountain. At that time, it had not completely sunk. Tang Hesheng, the captain of the Guangji, ordered the ship to approach the sunken ship and heard calls for help from the sea. Using binoculars, he saw three people in the water near the sailing ship. Tang ordered the ship to stop and immediately dispatched First Officer Li Mingao and Second Officer Shen Cai to lower a boat and risk approaching the sailing ship. They rescued the three people in distress and brought them aboard.</p>
<p>The sailors recounted their ordeal. The three rescued people, named Wu Xianji, Wu Maoqing, and Wu Xiaomao, were said to be the owners of the sailing ship. After being brought aboard the Guangji, Tang provided them with clothing and food and inquired about their ordeal. They said that they were sailing to Zhou when they encountered a strong wind in the waters off Daiman Mountain at 2 p.m. on the 21st. The ship capsized, and all the cargo and belongings were lost. After falling into the sea, no ships passed by, and they thought they had no chance of survival until they were rescued. The three were brought to Shanghai by the Guangji.</p>
<p>The distressed passengers were sent back to Wenzhou. The three rescued people were immediately taken in on board. Since they had no relatives or friends in Shanghai, Tang Hesheng, the captain of the Guangji, reported the matter to the headquarters, which ordered the ship to return them to Wenzhou. Yesterday, Wu Xianji and the others left Shanghai on the Guangji. It is said that the wrecked sailing ship broke up and sank to the bottom of the sea within three hours. Zhao Tieqiao has ordered that Tang Hesheng and the crew of the Guangji be commended for respecting the maritime distress convention and rescuing the people who fell into the sea.</p>

<p>It was an accidental discharge while cleaning a gun.</p>
<p>Marshall, the secretary of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, died the other day as a result of an accidental discharge of a gun while cleaning it. According to a report in Bazhi yesterday, Mr. Marshall wrote two letters that afternoon, one to his wife. The British Consulate has requested the post office to return them for examination. When the police heard the news, they immediately sent officers to the General Chamber of Commerce to investigate. According to Hua De, the vice-secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, he had known Mr. Marshall for fifteen years and had never heard of him having any financial or family problems. He did not think that he had intended to commit suicide. After the examination, the body was moved to the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road for funeral arrangements. Mr. Marshall had served the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for nearly twenty years and left behind a wife and two daughters, all of whom are in Vancouver, as well as the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company.</p>

<p>The Public Works Bureau pays attention to traffic.</p>
<p>The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company needs a large amount of water in the area west of the Songhu Railway on Jiangwan Road. It plans to lay six-inch water pipes on Jiangwan Road from the front of the Sichuan Merchants Association to the Faculty of Law to expand the water supply. The Municipal Public Works Bureau reported that the road is an important traffic artery from Zhabei to Jiangwan and is also the route of the first public bus line for Chinese merchants. Therefore, it ordered the company to pay attention to three matters: (1) When digging the road, space should be left for public buses or freight cars to pass through. (2) The excavated soil and water pipes should be piled up in a place that does not obstruct the passage of vehicles. (3) The edges of the excavated road trench must be supported with plank piles and cross braces to prevent collapse due to the vibration of passing vehicles. If vehicles are damaged as a result, the company shall be responsible. Subsequently, the company re-submitted and was approved by the Public Works Bureau to mark the excavation warning signs with the words "[Vehicles must not exceed ten miles per hour]" to avoid danger.</p>

<p>Huang A'san, a tailor from Dapu, Guangdong, aged 48, went to the Xin Xin Dafang Inn at No. 18 Baoyu Lane, French Concession, alone at 8 p.m. the night before and asked to borrow a room, paying a room fee of 7 jiao. He then went out and returned to the inn at 2 a.m. late at night with a young woman, Huang Zhang, and her son, Huang Yongsheng, to sleep. Unexpectedly, at 5 a.m. the next morning, Zhang suddenly fell ill with diarrhea and died shortly thereafter. The tea room attendant informed the inn owner, Xu Debiao, who reported it to the Da Zi Ming Zhong police station. The police chief ruled that she had died of illness and instructed the relatives to collect the body themselves. Huang then tried to buy a coffin and hastily made arrangements for burial. Since there was no place to store the coffin, he requested the assistance of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to bury it in a charitable cemetery for future retrieval. The police station, considering that an epidemic had suddenly occurred in the inn and that the summer weather was hot, feared that it would spread and endanger the lives of the public and passengers. Therefore, they notified the Health Department to send a Western doctor to inspect the inn and spray disinfectant in each room to kill the disease and protect hygiene.</p>

<p>Zhang Jiasheng is unwilling to terminate the engagement</p>
<p>Zhang Jiasheng, 24 years old, from Longhua, works as a bamboo weaver in the Nanshi. Last year, his uncle, Wu Desheng, acted as matchmaker to marry A'bao, the daughter of Jiang Daokui of Caohejing. They set a betrothal gift of 140 yuan and two gold and two silver six gifts. The engagement was made in November last year, and the wedding was scheduled for October this year. However, Zhang was hit and injured by a car on the way to collect payment for goods on Daxilu in April. He was seriously injured in his right foot and sent to the hospital for treatment. His right foot was amputated, but his life was not in danger. However, he became disabled. Last month, Zhang recovered from his illness and was discharged from the hospital and returned to his home in Longhua. The woman's family learned that the fiancé had become disabled, so Jiang did not want to marry Zhang. Therefore, he invited the matchmaker, Wu Desheng, to his home and asked to cancel the marriage. He asked for the horoscope to be returned and the betrothal gifts and six gifts to be returned. Wu told Zhang, but Zhang was extremely angry and unwilling to terminate the engagement. He wrote a letter to Jiang to severely reprimand him. Jiang has recently been urging the matchmaker to resolve the matter and has heard that he intends to file a lawsuit with the officialdom for relief.</p>

<p>Suspected to be a misunderstanding by the murderer.</p>
<p>The Guangxinlong Pork Lard Shop on the east side of the Qiujiang Bridge Small Vegetable Market in Hongkou is owned by Chen Yizhi, a Cantonese. He has been in business for many years and has accumulated some savings. Chen hired Liang Juxi, 35 years old, also from Guangdong, as manager. He was capable and made the business more prosperous. At 8:30 a.m. yesterday morning, Liang went out to buy pork lard to Jiaxing Road, Ruikang Li. As soon as he entered the alley, two strong men jumped out from behind. One grabbed Liang's chest and arms, and the other chopped into his left back with an axe. Liang was injured and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The murderer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled quickly. Subsequently, the Harbin police officer arrived and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment by car. Afterwards, according to Liang, the owner of the shop, Chen Yizhi, received two scam letters in March of this year. The content of the first letter was roughly: We brothers are in difficulty and need to borrow 2,000 yuan to solve our urgent needs. He also agreed on a place to hand over the money. However, Chen secretly reported the letter to the Public Security Bureau in charge. A few days later, another letter came with harsh wording and two bullets attached, limiting the date of delivery. The suspected name was Wang A'wang, etc. Chen had ignored it and had been safe and sound until now. I am unfortunately injured today and fear that the bandits mistakenly regard me as Yizhi and did this, which is unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Seducing Engagement and Abandoning After <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Please pursue 20,000 yuan in alimony</p>
<p>Zhong Erbao, the 18-year-old daughter of Zhong Xu, a woman from Suzhou, hired lawyer Dong Yu to represent her in a case in the French Court against Liu Peifu, the owner of Tiansheng Dyeing Factory at No. 79 Laoshifu Road, for seducing an engagement and abandoning her after the fact, requesting the pursuit of alimony. The statement of claim roughly stated that the defendant seduced her into engagement and abandoned her after the fact, requesting a judgment to pay alimony. First, the plaintiff's eldest daughter, Erbao, was waiting to be married and had not been promised to anyone. In July of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the defendant sent his factory partner, Zhang A'zhao, to act as a matchmaker and formally engaged her to the defendant, stating that he had no wife. The plaintiff repeatedly refused because the defendant's family owned hundreds of thousands of gold, a wealth that was not a good match. However, on the 19th of a certain month in the 18th year, the defendant took advantage of her being unprepared to seduce Erbao and commit adultery, not allowing her to go home. On November 19, it was discovered that she was renting a house at No. 240 Longmen Road. The plaintiff heard about it and went to bring her to the police station, but the defendant kowtowed and begged for forgiveness, asking her not to publicize it, and promised to prepare a gift and marry her within a month. However, it was repeatedly postponed without any sincerity. Later, it was discovered that the defendant already had a wife. The previous marriage proposal, falsely claiming that he was unmarried, was clearly a seduction. If he had mistakenly believed that there was a marital relationship, it would have constituted a criminal offense. Unexpectedly, the defendant went even further and suddenly sent a letter through representative lawyer Gu Changyuan this month, instructing the plaintiff to go to the law firm to negotiate, otherwise he would file a lawsuit. The defendant, relying on his wealth, intended to use his power to bully people and force her to break the engagement, abandoning her after the fact, which was clear. A woman's chastity is important, and now she has been abandoned halfway. According to one-twentieth of the defendant's property, the following requests are made: (1) Order the defendant to pay the plaintiff Erbao 10,000 yuan in alimony. (2) The plaintiff Erbao's daily life cannot be maintained, and she requests that the defendant's proposal be submitted for bail. (3) The defendant bears the court fees, etc. After Judge Gong Jun approved the application, the defendant was summoned yesterday but did not appear. The judge instructed the case to be adjourned for seven days and the defendant summoned again for questioning based on the plaintiff's lawyer's statement of the case.</p>

<p>Qin Zemin comes to Shanghai to claim his daughter-in-law</p>
<p>Wang Dezhang, a native of Ganyu, has a daughter named Xiaoqunzi, who is now 19 years old. Since childhood, she was promised to Qin Zemin's son Koucheng, a fellow villager. She has not yet married. Wang, because his family was poor, wanted to take his daughter to Shanghai to work. At that time, the Qin family heard about it and went to stop him, wanting to take Xiaoqunzi back to be raised. Wang refused and asked a matchmaker to guarantee that he would wait for Xiaoqunzi to grow up and then return to his hometown to complete the marriage. Wang took his daughter to Shanghai and entered the old silk factory on Jessfield Road to work. After a few years, Xiaoqunzi grew into a talented woman and now works as a runner for a certain coal company. A certain Xu saw that Xiaoqunzi was young and beautiful and wanted to marry her, willing to pay 240 yuan in betrothal gifts. Wang was greedy for profit and immediately agreed to the marriage. Now, the Qin family has found out. Qin Zemin came to Shanghai with his son Koucheng the day before yesterday to demand the person from Wang, ordering him to hand over Qunzi so that he could choose a date to complete the marriage. Wang, on the pretext that his daughter was young, said that he had to wait another year or two before he could get married. Qin knew that something was wrong and called the police, who took Wang to the First Precinct of the Fourth District. After Yao Suozhang questioned him, he transferred the case to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation because it concerned a marital dispute.</p>

<p>Cheng Minghan was arrested by detectives Huang Fusen and Chen Yonggui of the Laozha Police Station in the lane of Tonganli, Hankou Road, at 2 p.m. the day before yesterday. He confessed that he was a thief and revealed that his accomplices were hiding in a certain hotel on Avenue Edward VII.

Three pistols and eight bullets were also found. They then continued to room 510 of the hotel and arrested Xing Ermao and two women, Zhang Fang (also known as Jinmei) and Chen Wu. After being taken back to the police station for questioning, they went to No. 52 Huizhong Hotel on Shandong Road and No. 11 Zhongxing Hotel in Zhujiaqiao, French Concession, and arrested Wang Xiaohong (i.e., Gan Xiaomao) and Wang Yunzhang. They were all taken to the Special District Local Court yesterday morning. Judge Xu briefly questioned them and ordered them to be detained separately because the police station still needed to investigate.</p>

<p>Reversal of the Case of "Shè Liè Jì"</p>
<p>Xiaoribao was previously sued by the police station for publishing an article "Shè Liè Jì" because the words were obscene and considered harmful to public morals. The court issued a ticket to summon Huang Guangyi, the publisher of the newspaper, and sentenced him to a fine of 200 yuan. However, Gangbao was also accused of publishing "Shè Liè Jì" and was only fined 50 yuan. Therefore, Gangbao immediately paid the fine, while Huang Guangyi was unconvinced and hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to appeal to the local court of the same level. The reason was that there were seven shareholders of Xiaoribao, and Huang Guangyi only accounted for one-seventh of the shares. There were five editors, and the chief editor was You Bankuang. In terms of status and responsibility, Huang should not be solely responsible. He requested a reversal and dismissal of the original judgment, etc. The case was sent to Zhou Han, the president of the local court, for a hearing. After Chen further debated based on legal principles, Zhou publicly ruled yesterday afternoon to dismiss the original judgment and declare Huang Guangyi innocent. You Bankuang, who should be held responsible, has also been summoned by the primary criminal court of the same court for questioning and sentenced to a fine of 100 yuan as a warning.</p>

<p>Pending Submission of Mortgage Certificate for Further Verification</p>
<p>He Gengxing, the owner of the Hongyu and Huiyu hardware stores in the French Concession, recently could not maintain the business due to the impact of the gold rush. He secretly fled the store last month. The court then appointed accountants Pan Zhaobang and Wu Zheng to clean up the accounts and approved the court to provisionally attach the business and store foundations of the two stores. Lawyer Yu Zhongluo, representing the liquidation office of Junji Money Shop, stated that Hongyu and Dongyu had previously been mortgaged by He Gengxing to Junji Money Shop for 33 mei liang of silver. Therefore, he objected to the attachment and submitted a statement to the French Court requesting revocation. After review, the court summoned Yu, the lawyer representing Junji Money Shop, to state the case. Then, lawyers Jin Yu and Lin Hanqing, representing various creditor groups, stated that their lawyers represented more than ten creditor households, totaling 550,000 liang and 70,000 yuan owed by the defendant He Gengxing. They requested that the defendant be summoned and investigated, and that the defendant be ordered to appear in court. According to accountant Pan, there was no record of the store being mortgaged to Junji in the account books of Hongyu and Huiyu. The two stores owed about 1 million yuan. Lawyer Yu said that Junji had a mortgage certificate that could be verified by the accountant. Judge Gong ruled that with regard to Junji's request to revoke the court's order, accountant Pan should verify whether there was a mortgage certificate and submit it for further verification.</p>

<p>On the upper floor of the Jingxin Sock Factory at No. 1186, Zhongshi, Caojiadu Town, Jessfield Road, West Shanghai, there were five tenant households. The front half of the building, including the three-story mezzanine, was rented by Shen Fushou, who ran a lantern shop in Erkangli and used it to store lantern bamboo materials.

The patrol police saw it and immediately reported it to the town's fire brigade, which happened to be nearby. They drove to the scene and worked hard to extinguish the fire. Soon, the fire was extinguished. The fire brigade of the concession also drove to the scene, but the fire had been completely extinguished. A total of one room on the upper floor was burned down, and the sock factory downstairs and the Songshou Pharmacy next door were also damaged. The police station of the Sixth District sent police to the scene to investigate the cause of the fire and took the fire starter, Shen Fushou, back to the station for investigation.

<p>Zhang Jinfu, a 36-year-old resident of No. 2 Zhujiabang, North Wusong Town, married Mao Langxian, the sister of Mao Changgeng from Chongming. They have been married for many years and have a good relationship. Langxian, 22 years old, is beautiful and is known as the Xi Shi of Chongming. However, she is naturally licentious and often teases her neighbors. When her husband is away at work, she soon forms an inextricable relationship with Chen Lin, a fellow villager next door, and they secretly date. Zhang Jinfu learned about it and kept it a secret for the sake of face. He did not reprimand his wife but used kind words to persuade her. However, Langxian thought that her husband was weak and could be deceived, so she became even more unrestrained and openly invited Chen to her home for a tryst in the daytime. At 2 p.m. yesterday, Zhang Jinfu returned home and broke into the bedroom, seeing his wife and Chen lying neck to neck without a stitch of clothing. While he was busy working during the daytime, Jinfu was extremely angry when he saw this. He invited several neighbors to tie up the adulterer and adulteress who were completely naked for half an hour. Then he wanted to send Chen to the police station for investigation. After mediation by the neighbors, Chen was ordered to apologize and promised never to do it again. Zhang Jinfu strictly controlled his wife Langxian.</p>

<p>A Letter from the Trade Association to the Xiao Company</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in order to protect the residential rights of its members in the trade, yesterday sent a letter to the Xiao Company, which manages rental properties. The letter stated: "Regarding the matter of the Trade Association's letter stating that its members, Shi Rui Ji and Xin Xie Shun, received a letter from the North Shanghai Tax Collection Office, which was forwarded by the Xiao Fang branch of Baoshan Road, saying that the houses of these two firms have been re-rented to the Municipal Bank and should be vacated immediately with appropriate moving expenses provided, otherwise, barriers will be erected on the 15th of this month. These two firms have been doing business here since the early years of the Republic, and their customers are familiar with them. Relocation would make it difficult for them to maintain their business. Furthermore, after suffering from looting by Fengtian troops, their vitality has not recovered. Afterwards, the landlord rebuilt the premises, and the rent and fees paid for each building have reached more than two hundred yuan, plus additional renovations. We request that you find a way to help them so that they can maintain their business. The Association has dispatched personnel to negotiate with the Municipal Bank. According to the Vice-Manager of the Bank, Mr. Chen Zhangwen, the bank is willing to provide more relocation expenses if the stores are willing to move, but will not force them to move. Furthermore, a letter from the North Shanghai Tax Collection Office of the Bureau of Finance replied that this case was only negotiated with the Xiao Company and did not involve direct contact with merchants, nor was it enforced by the Public Security Bureau. How can it be called forced lease? The Association believes that since the Municipal Bank does not intend to force the stores to move and does not want to rent them, and the North Shanghai Tax Collection Office denies any forced lease, the key to resolving this matter lies entirely with your rental office. These two stores have been renting and doing business here for nearly twenty years, and their customers are familiar with them. Relocation would inevitably make it difficult to maintain their business. These stores are small-scale businesses and their situation is extremely pitiful. From the standpoint of humanitarianism and out of consideration for the many years of good relations in renting the entire property, it is necessary to give this due consideration. Moreover, putting aside sentiment and reason, the law states that since the tenants have not defaulted on their rent, and the landlord is not taking back the property for their own use, according to recent court decisions in this city, if the tenants do not voluntarily agree to move, the landlord cannot force them to move. Your rental office is presumably aware of this point, and should not stubbornly ignore it. Therefore, we have prepared this letter to request that you allow these two stores to continue renting the premises so that they can conduct their business in peace. This is our sincere hope. To the Xiao Company Rental Office."</p>
<h3 id="e137">On the Causes of the Fall in Silver Prices <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Translated by the World News Agency from the London Economic Times: The world's silver production last year totaled 25,650,000 ounces, slightly less than Mexico's production in 1928. Mexico accounted for 42 percent of this total, and the United States accounted for 24 percent. In the previous decade, the world's silver production increased by about 48 percent. The increase in the United States was limited. Other major silver-producing countries are Canada, Peru, and Australia. Seventy-five percent of the world's silver production is used for coinage, and more than twenty percent is used for arts and crafts. Last year, India and China absorbed 70 percent of the world's silver production. China accounted for 13,700,000 ounces and India accounted for 8,200,000 ounces. One of the main reasons for the current fall in silver prices is that some countries have stopped minting silver coins, causing the demand for silver to shrink sharply. The Indian government has adopted the gold standard and is now selling its silver reserves. As for the Kemmerer Commission's proposals in China to gradually adopt the gold standard to consolidate the currency system, it is feared that this will soon be implemented, and the use of silver will also be drastically reduced. Another reason is the reduction in the fineness of silver coins. In 1928 alone, the fineness of silver coins reduced by England, France, and Belgium reached a huge 38 million ounces. The fall in silver prices has most affected silver producers. For example, the Burma Silver Mining Company mined 7,376,841 ounces of silver in the year ending June 30 last year. The relationship between income and expenses is very significant, and the stock values of various silver mining companies will also inevitably fall. As for trade between Manchester and China, it is still based on silver. After the fall in silver prices, transactions have sharply decreased, causing great difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Declaration of the Zhufeng Trade Union Requesting Assistance <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Temporary Closure of the Factory</p>
<p>The Zhufeng Enamel Factory Trade Union's declaration to all sectors requesting assistance regarding the factory's temporary closure states: "To all newspaper offices, fellow countrymen, and fellow workers in the city, please be advised that since the signing of the agreement with the capital last year, there has been no practical improvement in the conditions. However, we always hoped that the factory would be understanding, so we endured and worked hard. Unexpectedly, the factory not only failed to understand the workers but also intensified its oppression. Recently, because we requested rice subsidies, the factory unconditionally announced a temporary closure, leaving 500 fellow workers with no means of livelihood. The Labor Dispute Resolution Law is something that all capitalists must abide by, even imperialist capitalists must absolutely abide by it when setting up factories in our Chinese territory. The capitalists of our Zhufeng Factory have stubbornly and openly violated this. Since the Hong case occurred, the factory has dismissed seven workers without notifying the trade union or submitting it to the Social Bureau [because Article 3 of our agreement states that the company shall not dismiss workers without cause, and if they are dismissed for cause, the reasons shall be announced and the trade union notified]. Therefore, based on the facts at the time and the court's evidence [because the court denied that the seven were responsible for injuring Hong], we protested and requested mediation. While mediation was in progress, the factory unconditionally announced a temporary closure as a means of intimidation. Article 35 of Chapter 4 of the Labor Dispute Resolution Law states that employers or laborers may not commence a strike or closure during the mediation or arbitration period. This proves the factory's violation of regulations and also proves that the factory is using the Hong case as a pretext to deprive workers of their livelihood. The trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap is intensifying day by day, and the price of rice has also increased to 24 yuan. The high cost of goods has also increased significantly. Workers' lives are becoming increasingly difficult under the pressure of the environment, especially the workers in the enamel industry (average of 15 yuan per month per person), it is even more difficult to sustain themselves. In order to preserve our families' lives, we workers can only ask the capitalists who employ us for subsidies. Moreover, our request is very modest (a subsidy of 5 yuan per person when the price of rice is above 18 yuan, a subsidy of 3 yuan per person when the price of rice is below 18 yuan, and the subsidy is cancelled when the price of rice is 14 yuan). The factory has ample room to accommodate this. Now the factory not only refuses to accept this but also uses an unconditional temporary closure to cut off the workers' livelihood. This proves the ironclad evidence of the Zhufeng Factory's oppression of workers. Dear fellow countrymen, what possibility of liberation is there for us workers of the Zhufeng Factory under this kind of threatening oppression? How can we find a life? The slogan of justice overcoming power will never be extinguished or changed under the blue and white flag. However, we, with our weak abilities, are especially afraid that our strength will be insufficient. We hope that all party and government organs, fellow countrymen from all walks of life, and fellow workers in Shanghai will come to help us oppressed workers emerge from the water and fire and ascend to a comfortable seat. Our association respectfully leads all 500 workers in the factory to offer incense and prayers, and earnestly presents these words in the hope of public judgment. Respectfully presented by the Zhufeng Enamel Factory Trade Union of the Shanghai Special Municipality, leading all 500 workers."</p>

<p>This year, northern Jiangsu is experiencing a spring famine, with Xinghua being the most severely affected area. Local Chinese and Western individuals organized a Xinghua Hua Yang Charity Relief sub-association. The Shanghai Hua Yang Charity Relief Association allocated funds for relief efforts. The relief effort has now concluded, and the sub-association has reported on the progress of the relief efforts, which are transcribed as follows: "The sub-association has received a total of 10,050 yuan in relief funds from the association, 3,000 yuan in relief funds from the Xinghua relief sub-association, and 110.02 yuan from other sources, for a total of 13,160.02 yuan in relief funds. The temporary relief tickets from the Jiangsu Provisional Charity Relief Association were borrowed and stamped with the sub-association's seal. These tickets were sent to the Fifth District to issue them. The district has a total of 14 map regions, 366 villages, and 3,420 households. The tickets were issued based on the severity of the disaster and the number of family members, divided into six grades represented by the six characters 'An Ding Jing An Lv De', representing 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 yuan. The tickets were issued at the Grandma Temple in Anfeng Town on May 30 of this year, with the Xinghua County Magistrate present to supervise. A total of 3,420 relief tickets were issued, totaling 12,298 yuan. A subsidy of 300 yuan was provided to the Anfeng Town soup kitchen, and 377.43 yuan was spent on relief expenses. After deducting expenses, a balance of 184.59 yuan remains. The spring relief effort in the Fifth District has been completed, and the remaining funds are being sent to the Xinghua relief sub-association for accounting. A summary of the spring relief effort, a statement of income and expenses, and 42 ticket stubs totaling 3,420 tickets, as well as the sub-association's seal, are being submitted to the association for review."</p>

<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society has repeatedly received reports from the Yixing Disaster Relief Committee in Jiangsu Province stating that the southwestern and southeastern regions of the county are surrounded by bare mountains with barren land, prone to drought and flooding. The area has suffered from recurring famines over the years. The area was flooded the year before last, and suffered from insect and drought disasters in the summer and autumn of last year. The harvests have been completely wiped out, which is unprecedented in decades. Villagers have chewed almost all of the fertilizer for the fertile fields and the grass that was cut for firewood, turning all of the mountains red and resulting in numerous suicides within families and deaths along the roads. Moreover, the mountain areas border Anhui and Zhejiang, attracting numerous bandits, causing merchants to hesitate and cutting off livelihoods, making the situation extremely precarious. Mr. Zhu Yuting, a local gentleman, has been appealing for help, but the funds obtained are far from sufficient. He urgently requests that benevolent aid be provided to relieve hunger and save lives. The suffering masses are eagerly awaiting help. The representative, Lawyer Sha Yankai, was sent to the society to appeal for help. The society has handled too many disaster areas in various provinces, and the relief funds are extremely difficult to raise, and the society's ability to assist is limited. However, the people are on the verge of death, and the society cannot bear to refuse them. Therefore, the society consulted with the Jiangsu Temporary Charity Relief Association to co-organize targeted relief efforts. Mr. Zhang Junzhongkuan has been publicly selected as the director of the Yixing relief effort, and he and fellow relief workers will depart for the county on June 23 to investigate and provide relief in the most severely affected areas.</p>

<p>The Family Dispute of Yan Juncai</p>
<p>Yan Juncai, a native of Yancheng, is currently over 50 years old. He previously ran a stationery store in his hometown and married Wang Chen, a widow, as his wife. She brought a 13-year-old son from a previous marriage, whom Yan raised and helped find a wife. However, the stepson was naturally foolish, and the couple's relationship was not harmonious. Later, Yan lost his job and came to Shanghai to seek employment. He brought his daughter-in-law to Shanghai to work. Ten years have passed with no news. Yan is currently working as a tea server at a trade union at the North Railway Station. Wang Chen brought her son to Shanghai to find her. She ran into Yan at the intersection of Xinmin Road and Wuzhen Road in Zhabei the other day. Wang asked him about his daughter-in-law's whereabouts, and Yan prevaricated. Wang reported the matter to the police, and the police took him to the Fourth District First Precinct. After Director Yao interrogated him, he was sent to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for verification yesterday.</p>

<p>— Wang Yanjin</p>
<p>The first cry for gender equality: In today's Japan, the preference for males over females is like my country's Qing Dynasty. Women have absolutely no inheritance or political rights. The inequality between men and women is significant. However, women's education is gradually becoming popularized, and there are also many people who receive higher education. Therefore, the movement for political participation is becoming increasingly intense. However, women who have received higher education have repeatedly been rejected when they submit applications for the higher civil service examinations. This year, the authorities finally accepted one application. From now on, there will also be female prefectural governors in Japan (Japan is divided into three prefectures and forty-seven counties, and the prefectural governors are high-ranking civil servants directly under the central government). The applicant who was accepted this time is Ms. Tianbian Pingxue, the wife of Tokyo University of Technology Professor and Doctor of Engineering Tianbian Pingxue. Those in the know all call her Moeeinmaiden.</p>
<p>An unprecedented university strike: Kyoto Otani University has caused great controversy due to budget allocation issues. On the 11th of this month, all full-time or part-time professors and lecturers resigned, and clerks and other staff members also resigned en masse.

<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>Mudu is just a small town on the shores of Lake Tai. Since the Wu palace lady Xi Shi visited this place, it has made the cliffs and streams more beautiful, and the springs and rocks have gained luster. Her beautiful traces have been passed down for thousands of years. Therefore, on fine spring and autumn days, there is an endless stream of people punting here. Mudu produces water shield, which can dispel heat in summer and cold in autumn. Zeng Xiangxiang praised it as the first delicacy of Jiangdong. However, in addition to water shield, there is also a famous handicraft called Mohouluo. The Wu Men Biao Yin says that Mohouluo is produced in Mudu by the Yuan family. Yuan Yuchang of Mudu was skilled in sculpture and painting. The Mohouluo he created was especially exquisite. The Meng Hua Lu mentions that Yuan's descendants passed down his business for generations. More than ten years ago, there was still an earthen figure shop at the end of the west street in the town. It was exquisitely made and far surpassed the items from Huishan in Liangxi. People came from far and wide to purchase them. Unfortunately, the owner was old and had no heirs, and had no intention of continuing the business, so it closed. A relative of the Yue family lived in Mudu for generations. My wife also stayed there for a while and said that she had seen the Yue family's collection of ancient Mohouluo, numbering dozens of pieces, sculpting the characters in The Story of the Stone's Grand View Garden. All of them could express the infatuation of the Yihong Gongzi, the melancholy of the Xiaoxiang Concubine, the sharpness of Wang Xifeng, the honesty of Xiangyun, the handsomeness of Gongren, the simplicity of Xiangling, the intelligence of Zijuan, and the cleverness of Ping'er in their eyes. The skill was so divine that one was moved to stop and admire. The Mudu elder Yuan Xue'an, a painter, should be a descendant of Yu Chang. I do not know if he has any unique Mohouluo in his collection. I deeply wish to see it to broaden my horizons.</p>

<p>The sparrow craze as flood: In the past, small birds such as parrots, thrushes, and wagtails, as well as small yellow dogs, were shipped from Shanghai to the Japanese mainland, and were welcomed by the Japanese, who competed to buy them. The business was booming for a while. However, the number of people who like this is gradually decreasing. In this summer, the "mahjong" game, which has been popular for about two years, is exceptionally popular. People from all walks of life, whether in the business or academic world, are enjoying it. According to the Japanese customs authorities, the monthly import volume of mahjong tiles last year was only 50 to 60 sets. However, according to the Nagasaki Customs report for May this year, there were 311 sets as baggage carried by passengers and 105 sets as goods imported with a small tax. The total of 416 sets is an unprecedented amount. The Japanese call it the "flood" period of mahjong imports.</p>
<h3 id="e153">A Record of Visiting a Rotary Printing Machine <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>By Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Savings Bank recently purchased a rotary printing machine from abroad, costing over three hundred taels of silver. Its printing plate is made of a roll of cotton paper with a layer of glue, slightly sticky.</p>
<p>It is about half a point thick, eight and a half inches wide, and one hundred and sixty inches long. Both ends are connected with waxed cloth, mounted on wooden axes so it can be unrolled like a hand scroll onto an iron plate with a felt surface. The actual flat surface used is only fourteen inches. Each time a manuscript is written with duplicating ink, it is applied to the glued surface, reportedly capable of printing over one hundred and ninety copies. However, actual tests showed that it could not print beyond eighty copies. Generally, a manuscript can be applied two to three times, totaling over two hundred copies. After the glue surface absorbs the ink, it must be left for twenty-four hours before it can be reused. The ink penetrates deep into the pores and cannot be washed off with water, hence the use of a rotary roll for gradual unrolling and repetition. The bank had not used it for long before it had to replace a roll of the glue surface due to flaking and melting, rendering it unusable. Upon request, I took it back for experimentation. It melted at 90 degrees Fahrenheit, with a glycerol content as high as 85%. Upon inquiring about the price from the Old Jinson Foreign Firm, each roll of glue board costs $55.40, and each bottle of ink costs $4.50, with a volume of only one English ounce and a high acetic acid content. I tried to imitate the ink with equal concentration, and it could print up to one hundred copies and be reprinted four times, so each manuscript can be printed more than four hundred copies. The cost is less than one yuan. The experimental glue board, with reduced glycerol and added protein, has a melting point up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit without the problems of water leakage and easy melting, since the hottest weather is only about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. After printing, it can be washed off immediately with water. If not washed off, after 24 hours, the ink will penetrate deep into the pores and not remain on the surface, ready for another manuscript to be applied and printed. Therefore, why necessarily use a rotary roll that makes the glue surface prone to damage? In my opinion, it is better to have multiple flat glue boards for replacement, which is sufficient. As for the machine, it is not particularly necessary. Its only advantage is printing ruled paper. In reality, when applying the manuscript, simply align the paper tightly with the corners of the glue board's edge and apply ink to the glue surface. Afterwards, when printing, place the paper in the original position according to the right angle, which can also print ruled paper without any skewing or misalignment. Why use this cumbersome iron machine? And since the glue board can be washed, two pieces are sufficient for turnover. If a manuscript is applied twice and printed by two people simultaneously, over two hundred copies can be printed in ten minutes. Washing off the floating ink and reprinting takes only ten more minutes. Therefore, I have modified this protein glue and acetic acid ink for use in our brand's printing equipment, which will be advertised later to avoid occupying this space. However, I have one thought about these printing tools: regarding culture, they are not luxuries, but imported goods are priced high, making them unaffordable for ordinary people, and using accessories becomes a source of endless profit. In this era of rising gold prices, those who purchase foreign machines inevitably have to purchase parts and consumables from abroad, and the suffering of being bound is immense. Is the lack of social trust in domestic products due to their low value, thus suspecting that their effectiveness must be inferior? Such psychological effects are truly the way our country becomes poor, which is lamentable.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Travels in Nanyang (37) <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Lianhua</p>
<p>On the fourth day, I visited the Japanese seaside fishing pavilion. The method involves setting up a wooden shed by the sea, building a cool pavilion, and providing tea and coffee to wait for tourists. Various types of fish are raised for guests to fish. If a guest catches a fish, they cannot take it but must give the pavilion several corners of a currency unit. Taking a fish is even more expensive. This is used for amusement. But operating this business is also a way to make money. Many white men and women come to play and fish. But the Japanese maids who serve tea are very old and dark, far inferior to the maids in Japan. Is this because they have become darker in Nanyang?</p>
<p>I heard that there are not many Japanese people in this area, less than a thousand. Most of them engage in the fishing industry. Fishing is a very profitable industry in the ocean. In the past, a friend wanted to start the South Pole Shipbuilding Company. According to his plan, the coastal fishing industry from Hainan to Niuzhuang would be very profitable. Only by placing electric lights on the fishing boats could one earn a profit of 10,000 yuan per day, it was said. It is a pity that his ship was not built. Nowadays, the Japanese are very powerful in the fishing industry in various places. Even the fish eaten in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places are often called Japanese fish, as can be seen. The Japanese custom is to hang large paper carp in front of the door or on the roof of the house. Now, this custom can still be seen in the homes of Japanese people here. I once asked a Japanese woman in Japan what the meaning of hanging carp was. She replied that it meant wishing for a son because carp are brave and powerful. There are Japanese grocery stores, hotels, and barbershops here. One day, I wanted to get a haircut, but I did not want to go into a Japanese store. From my ideal of a "Great Unity," and not wanting to get a haircut in a Japanese store, it can be seen that national boundaries cannot be removed in a day, and the competition between ethnic groups cannot be avoided by anyone.</p>
<p>The fifth day was the Lunar Qingming Festival. Overseas, there is still the custom of the lunar calendar. Monks held a memorial service. I found the wording of the release ritual very tragic.</p>
<p>Chao Miao was a lyricist who understood Buddhism and wrote it, and reading it was very touching. The Qingming Festival is considered a ghost festival, as an old poem says, "On Qingming, no traveler does not miss home," so many men and women go to temples to pay respects and offer incense. Overseas, it is still the same as the customs in the country. I remember that during the spring, the Annam Daily was describing the grand occasion of the Lantern Festival in January. Also, the Spring Couplets posted by each family still use the old calendar, and fortune-telling and divination are entirely consistent. The business of treating illnesses is very prosperous, and some monks have become rich by engaging in this, which can also reveal the customs of overseas. Many doors are inscribed with the names of great immortals who treat illnesses. Next to a temple, a sign is written, "The Position of the Thousand-Year-Old Fox." In each temple, there is a method that can inspire people's faith: setting up memorial tablets for people's ancestors, in different sizes depending on the amount of money paid, from a thousand yuan, five hundred yuan, to fifty yuan, like spirit tablets, which are offered incense diligently by monks three times a day. This method is very popular in Japan, where people worship spirit tablets on behalf of others as if they were their own descendants. I think this method is quite reasonable. If the dead are conscious, they do not need to wait for their descendants to make offerings. This method is also feasible.</p>
<p>Re-printing is also time-consuming, but it only takes ten minutes, which is enough. Therefore, this protein glue and acetic acid ink have been modified for use in our brand's printing equipment, and advertisements will be published separately to avoid taking up this space. However, I have one thought about this: such printing equipment is not a luxury related to culture, but imported goods are priced high, making them unaffordable for ordinary people. Furthermore, accessories are a continuous source of profit. In this era of rising gold prices, those who purchase foreign machines inevitably have to purchase parts and consumables from abroad, and the suffering of being bound is immense. Is the lack of social trust in domestic products due to their low value, thus suspecting that their effectiveness must be inferior? Such psychological effects are truly the way our country becomes poor, which is lamentable.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Small Words on Pen Hooks <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>The pen is one of the four treasures of the study, used for writing [according to Ancient and Modern Notes, in ancient times, bamboo and wooden slips were used, and pens were knives and awls; Meng Tian of the Qin Dynasty first used deer and sheep hair to make them]. Recently, there are many types of pens, including brushes, pencils, fountain pens, chalk, and stone pencils, each suited to its needs and all serving as beneficial tools for education and culture. However, the brush was created exclusively by our country, and the others are imitations of Western products. Therefore, the vast majority of people in society still use brushes when writing.</p>
<p>I once heard that a Westerner, upon returning to his country, described our country's brush to the public, saying, "The Chinese pen is a thin stick with a tuft of hair," which was considered strange and laughed at. In fact, things that have not been seen before are often considered strange upon first sight, just as our people initially viewed fountain pens and the like.</p>
<p>Zhang Jingzhao's beautiful eyebrow-drawing traces have been passed down as an eternal story. Therefore, the eyebrow-drawing pen should be considered the most successful of pens. But those ignorant children who practice calligraphy scribble at will, and fortune-tellers on the street sweep wildly with their pens – this is truly the misfortune of the pen. (A smile from the author.)</p>
<p>Alas, I have failed in both reading and business, and I am ashamed of my lack of success. I cannot emulate Ban Chao's discarding his pen to join the army, nor can I follow Lu Ji's abandoning his pen and burning his inkstone. I dare not even talk about Cao Cao's using two pens simultaneously. All I have is holding a pen to express my sorrow and wielding a brush to leave regrets, only earning a bald pen to spend my days. It is regrettable.</p>
<h3 id="e156">East Tour Correspondence (8) <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaohou</p>
<p>The current situation of social undertakings in Tokyo City, in Tokyo, as a source of culture and learning, takes active and implementing social policies when Tokyo Prefecture operations and private operations began to change, there was the establishment of nurseries, until 1890 when the municipal operations were changed until 1911, followed by the establishment of medical hospitals and employment agencies, etc. In 1919, due to the rice riots case, it wasn't until 1920 that the Tokyo Municipal Social Bureau was established. At the same time, the establishment of various social undertakings and the investigation and research of social conditions began to have concrete plans for implementation. Now, I will explain it by item:</p>
<p>(1) Approximate budget: The regular budget used by Tokyo City for social undertakings in the fourth year of Showa (1929) was 1,369,064 yuan, the temporary budget was 1,318,861 yuan, and the special accounting was 3,879,866 yuan, totaling approximately 6.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Social Welfare Committee System: According to statistics, there are approximately 300,000 poor, elderly, and sick people in Tokyo who need relief. For these 300,000 poor, elderly, and sick citizens, it is necessary to have a specialized and responsible organization under the municipal social bureau in each district to control the protection, guidance, and effective use of various social facilities in their daily lives. Therefore, the Social Welfare Committee system is established in each district. Among the 15 districts of Tokyo, the number of Social Welfare Committee members has been set up based on needs. There are 4 Social Welfare Committee members in Shitaya Ward, 6 Social Welfare Committee members each in Fukagawa, Asakusa, and Honjo Wards, 2 Social Welfare Committee members each in Kyobashi, Koishikawa, and Shiba Wards, and 1 Social Welfare Committee member each in Yotsuya, Hongo, Azabu, and Ushigome Wards. In total, there are 32 Social Welfare Committee members in the above 11 wards. Each Social Welfare Committee member averages 15 members, establishing a Social Welfare Committee office and setting up a chairman and vice-chairman each, entrusted by the mayor and the social bureau or ward chief to handle all social undertakings within the scope of their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>(3) Child Protection Facilities: Children are the foundation of healthy citizens in the future, and their protection is very important. There are five protection facilities: 1. Maternity hospitals and nurseries: There are three municipal ones, exclusively for poor people to give birth and raise infants. 2. Daycare centers: There are ten municipal ones. This type of organization is different from kindergartens and is exclusively for working parents who cannot afford to care for their four- and five-year-old children. 3. Child Counseling Centers: There are nine municipal ones, exclusively for citizens' children to consult on treatment methods when they are sick. 4. Juvenile Rehabilitation and Protection Centers: There are two municipal ones. One is the Tokyo Nursery, Inokashira School, which specializes in rehabilitating the most problematic teenagers. The other is the Tokyo Juvenile Protection Center, which specializes in taking in ordinary children who are not educated. 5. Children's playgrounds, i.e., children's parks: There are a total of 52 in Tokyo City, with three belonging to the municipality.</p>
<p>(4) Neighborhood Protection Projects: Neighborhood protection projects are labor education projects and are a type of supplementary education. The Tokyo Neighborhood Protection Hall is located in Koishikawa Ward, covering an area of 1,500 tsubo. The building is a steel-framed, reinforced concrete structure with a basement, totaling four floors. The first floor has offices, consultation rooms, meeting rooms, social rooms, lecture halls, night duty rooms, and servant rooms. The second floor has classrooms, libraries, study rooms, rental offices, balconies, and projection rooms. The third floor has indoor sports rooms, lecture rooms, club lodging rooms, etc. There are also outdoor exercise fields, dance fields, and sumo wrestling fields.</p>
<p>(5) Employment Referral Services: There are 15 municipal employment referral offices, including the Central Employment Referral Office and the Shibaen Employment Referral Office, etc., which specialize in introducing clerks and maids. On average, they refer approximately 30,000 to 60,000 people each year. There are also 8 employment referral offices such as the Shinjuku Employment Referral Office and the Hongo Employment Referral Office, which specialize in introducing labor services, totaling approximately 1.3 million people each year. There are also 5 municipal industrial training centers, which are exclusively for unemployed people to learn a profession, and their nature is different from the aforementioned employment referral offices.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Gold Standard Suffers a Reaction <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Frequent False Alarms Depress the Market Yesterday, the gold standard situation on the 26th was complex and varied, with unpredictable ups and downs. The bizarre and chaotic state was unfathomable, but the downward trend was reversed. Throughout the day, there were eight taels of ups and downs. The foreign exchange market seemed to be loosening slightly, and the selling sentiment among peers was strong. Fuchang, Hengxing, Zhifeng, Yongyan, and Yu, and other firms generally sold short positions, while Yuanxing, Yonghan, Hengchun, Fayong, and retail investors bought in. From the early market's sudden surge, it immediately weakened, and later fluctuated by two or three taels. At noon, the sellers acted bravely, and the exchange rate also declined, resulting in a sharp drop of six taels. In the strong aftermarket, Zhifeng, Yongtaixing, Yuancheng, Yong, and other firms all bought in, while Wanxing, Taiheng Yuan, and others sold. Initially, due to weak market sentiment, it felt even more depressed, and suddenly fell to 611 taels. The foreign exchange market seemed to be strong, and the market buyers flourished, surging five or six taels. However, the market changes were impermanent, and the waves were endless. Finally, head-to-head investors came to sell, eagerly driving the price down sharply by five or six taels. In fact, it was repeatedly erratic, and peers seemed like blind people and lame horses, with an unclear path. As a result, it closed at just over 612 taels. Yesterday, the large silver bar recovered by one-eighth, and the silver price also increased by one-quarter.</p>
<p>The early market has declined steadily. The opening price of gold for August was 617 taels and 8 mace, a decrease of 4 taels and 3 mace. The gross market fluctuated by two or three taels, reaching 19 taels and 5 candareens. When the first official price was announced, it increased from 16 taels and 6 or 7 candareens to 18 taels and 6 candareens. Because the listed price did not change, it seemed slightly stable. Internally, it was average. Sumitomo bought September futures at 5 pence and 9375, and also absorbed October US dollars at 36 yuan and 4375. At 9:30, it was 17 taels and 3 candareens. More than ten minutes later, it increased to around 19 taels. After 10 o'clock, it gradually went downstream as the first exchange rate hardened. Mitsui bought October futures at 6 pence and 0625, and Zhengjin bought September futures. Furthermore, Fuchang and Yuancheng tended to sell. Now it has plummeted more than 5 taels. At 11 o'clock, it was 13 taels and 3 or 4 candareens. After entering, some buyers jumped up 2 taels to 15 taels and 7 or 8 candareens. At 11:30, it was suddenly sold by the Guangdong gang, and it became weak again, suppressing it by 3 taels. At noon, it closed at 12 taels and 6 candareens. The announced price was still 672 taels and 6 candareens, a decrease of 55 to 60 taels.</p>
<p>Continued Downward Trend: After 8 Taels and 8 Mace The aftermarket opened at 611 taels and 8 Mace, then 12 taels and 4 candareens, and then fell to 11 taels and 1 candareens, which was sold by Yuanmao, Yongheng, and Hengxing. Especially the printing exchange was very large, and it immediately rose by three or four taels because goods were coming in and the daily gold recovery was firm. In the near term, the bank deposited 1 tael, 3 mace, and 5 fen, and Dalian absorbed next month's Citibank at 36 yuan and 375. Therefore, at 2:30, it was 15 taels and 4 candareens. Afterwards, the wheat firm issued September English gold at 6 pence, and Fuchang's sales were reduced to 12 taels and 6 or 7 candareens. After 3:30, all parties took action, and in an instant, the situation changed rapidly, plunging five taels in one fell swoop. At around 4 o'clock, it reached 17 taels and 8 candareens, but the market sentiment was not firm, and the sellers rose again, and the atmosphere deteriorated. In an instant, a violent storm broke out, and it fell into a weak state, falling by five or six taels, but it was unclear what was going on. The fear was also unfounded. At the close, it was 12 taels. At this time, some buyers turned friendly, pulling it up by more than one tael. At 4:30, it closed at 613 taels and 3 Mace, and then rose by one tael, between 10 and 12 candareens. However, compared to yesterday, it decreased by 8 taels and 8 Mace, almost a reversal. The highest price of the day was 19 taels and 5 candareens, and the lowest price was 11 taels and 1 candareens, a difference of 8 taels and 4 candareens. Looking back, the announced price decreased by 60 to 59 taels, with accounts of 7 taels in July and 13 taels in August. The cash water market before and after was the same, at 11 taels. The early opening price of goods was 17 taels and 8 Mace, the noon closing price was 11 taels and 5 Mace, the afternoon closing price was 11 taels and 5 Mace, and the afternoon closing price was 14 taels.</p>
<p>Speculation is chaotic, and the intention is difficult to understand. The peers' transactions were: Fuchang, Zhifengyong, Yu Da, Wanxing, Shunli, Taixing, Yanyu, Dadecheng, Hengxing, Yuancheng, etc. were all sold. Chunfayong, Yuankangxiang, Chengfengyong, Yuanyu Yong, and Deheng bought in. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong, Taixing, Yuancheng Yong, Chunyong, and Dayu all entered Wanxing, Taihengyuan, and Yuanmao all exited. Fuchang and goods came in and out without a fixed pattern. The Dalian gang bought and sold short positions, selling a total of about 2,000 units and buying 1,300 to 1,400 units. The Guangdong gang also issued more than 1,000 units, it was said.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Foreign Exchange Also Turns Weak <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants' Receipts and Payments Vary... The Dalian Gang Sells Current Dalian Hundreds of Thousands Yesterday, HSBC's listed foreign exchange rates did not change. Although the large silver bar was longer, it did not move. As for the domestic market, it was initially stable, slightly loose at noon, and slightly up and down in the afternoon, but ultimately tended to be stable. However, compared to the day before, it was weak. The English gold was long by 0625, the US gold was long by 3125, and the Japanese gold decreased by 2 and a half points. The gold market was turbulent, with more than 8 taels of difference throughout the day, but the potential low peak was suppressed by 8 or 9 taels. This was a reaction to the two days of consecutive gains, caused by the floating and unstable market sentiment and the unloading of large investors. Chinese merchants' transactions were not smooth, and receipts and payments varied. The English gold turnover was more than 100,000 pounds, with 50,000 to 60,000 pounds going to the diggers, and some selling tens of thousands of pounds. The banks' appetite was not strong, and it was sold by HSBC, Wheat Bank, Shanghai, and Zhejiang. Mitsui, Sumitomo, Shanghai, and Zhengjin absorbed some, and various banks did tens of thousands of dollars in mutual transactions, and also did 100,000 US dollars. Chinese merchants sold more than 100,000 US dollars, Sumitomo and Zhejiang absorbed, and the Japanese gold was sold by the Dalian gang, with current Dalian being hundreds of thousands. Korean Sumitomo bought in. It was heard that Dalian delivered goods and Shanghai received silver, and the Shanghai Bank sold some forward Japanese gold in the distance. The market atmosphere was potentially weak.</p>
<p>The domestic market for British Exchange was up and down by 1 or 2 candareens. In the morning, the prices for June and July were 1 shilling and 5 pence, the price for August was 125, and the buying price for September was 875 plus 0625. The noon closing prices were 875 for June and July, 9375 for August, and 6 pence for September. The afternoon closing price was the same as the noon closing price.</p>
<p>The domestic market for US Exchange was up and down by 25. From the early market, the prices for June and July were 35 yuan and 9375, the price for August was 36 yuan and 0625, and the buying price for September was 1875 plus 125. The noon closing prices were 36 yuan and 1875 for June and July, 3125 for August, and 4375 for September. The afternoon closing price was similar to the noon closing price.</p>
<p>The domestic market for East Exchange had a difference of 2 and a half points. In the morning, the price for June was 1 tael, 3 mace, and 8 fen, the price for July was 3 mace and 7 and a half fen, the price for August was 3 mace and 7925, and the buying price for September was 3 mace and 6 fen and 75 minus half a point to 375. The noon closing price for June was 1 tael, 3 mace, and 6 fen, the price for July was 3 mace and 5 fen and 5, the price for August was 3 mace and 5 fen, and the price for September was 3 mace and 4 fen and 5. The afternoon closing price was 1 tael, 3 mace, and 5 fen for June, 3 mace and a half fen for July, 3 mace and 4 fen and 5 for August, and 3 mace and 4 fen for September, with the buying price suppressed by half a point, it was said.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Overseas Silver Market Changes Busily <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Trending Upward Again</p>
<p>According to a London telegram yesterday, the large silver bar turned longer again, with the recent increase being 125 to 15 pence and 5625, and the distant increase also being 125 to 15 pence and 375. All parties absorbed slightly, and the market situation was average. Also received a New York telegram that the US silver price has also recovered by 25 to three corners, three minutes, and 625. The British to American rate did not change, remaining at 4 yuan, 8 corners, 6 minutes, and 02125. The American to British rate remained at 4 yuan, 8 corners, and 6 minutes. The Japanese to American rate remained at 49 yuan and 4375. The British to Japanese rate remained at 2 shillings and 04375. The English to Shanghai shilling remained at 1 shilling and 6 pence and 125. The Mumbai spot price decreased by 14 ounces and le per 44 rupees and 07 ounces and le.

<p>Market Overview Yesterday morning, the silver money industry was motivated by the high overnight trend and yesterday's aftermath, so transactions were quite prosperous. Unexpectedly, the customer road sales on this day were not as strong as in the previous days, resulting in a sharp drop in popularity in the afternoon and a slight softening of prices. Short-term lending prices (foreign short-term lending) The early market price of foreign short-term lending was half a li better than the previous day's noon market, at 7 mace, 2 fen, 4 li, and 2 hao and a half.

The Guangdong small ocean coin was 6 mace, 00 and a half li in the early market and 6 mace, 00 and 1 hao and 2 ho in the afternoon market. 135,000 horns were traded in the early market and 90,000 horns in the afternoon market. The copper coin market remained the same as before, at 397,000 thousand coins.</p>

<p>Securities: Public Bonds for August Have Been Listed</p>

<p>Yesterday, although many types of spot bonds were traded, the turnover was only 39,000 yuan. August futures trading has begun. Good Aftermath, Consolidation, Customs Duty Reduction, and Demobilization have all been issued, but there have been no other transactions. The market was quite calm. The total turnover for the day was over 5.6 million yuan. The bond market atmosphere was dull, and as the futures delivery approached, few parties were entering or exiting. The market price was very stable. The spot price was slightly firmer than the day before, but the Consolidation spot price fell significantly. The Reduction of Troops has been falling for a long time without trading, down 4 yuan and several corners from the middle of this month. The Stock Exchange will be suspended today to handle the June futures delivery.</p>

<p>Morning Downstream, Afternoon Slightly Flat... Observing the Situation, It Is Difficult to Stabilize</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and flattened in the afternoon, with a rapid trend. In reality, sales were sluggish, and the factories' inventory increased daily. The sharp drop in Indian cotton put even more pressure on the sellers. Many had to cut their losses, seeing the poor environment. Only the three-grade yarn slightly rebounded. The fact that the local yarn was weak was actually because most buyers turned short due to the decline in the world cotton market. The standard yarn price is feared to be difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>Lichang was the first seller of standard yarn. The sharp drop in Indian cotton caused panic, and the prices of each month fell by 5 or 6 cents. The selling pressure was even more intense, resulting in a drop of 7 cents to 1 tael, 1 tael and 3 cents, 1 tael and 6 cents, and 1 tael and 8 cents for each month. When the afternoon market opened, it was heard that the three-grade yarn rebounded by 4 or 5 yuan, and a part of the short market turned bullish, and the situation became slightly tight. At the close, it was heard that current sales were not strong, and some large investors sold short, and the market suddenly fell, resulting in an increase of 1.3 cents for each month. According to statistics, Shenxin, Gongtai, and Deji bought in from 1,000 to 2,100 bales. The sellers were Tianchang, Yicheng, Yuanping, and Lichang, with 1,000 to 4,350 bales. Lichang alone sold 4,350 bales, the most. The total turnover for the day was 33,850 bales. The closing price of the Renbiao is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The 16-count Japanese yarn fell by 2 taels, and the sales of foreign spot yarn were still clear. According to statistics, various gangs bought a total of 930 bales, and fellow traders entered 400 bales. In terms of market conditions, the 16-count Japanese yarn fell by 2 taels. Foreign traders entered 310 bales of futures from Tianjin, the most.

<p>Indian Cotton Plummets... Japanese Merchants Selling Cheaply</p>
<p>Hankow Standards Plunge... The Market is Shaken</p>
<p>The cotton market is plummeting, with Indian cotton experiencing a disastrous fall of 32 rupees, an unprecedented collapse. This is due to heavy inventories, a decline in the global cotton industry, and reduced consumption. Panic has gripped the local market, with buyers showing unease and settling positions. News spread in the afternoon that Japanese merchants were discounting Indian cotton, and Shensing had already made large purchases, further destabilizing the situation. However, Hankow dealers seized the opportunity to short sell, but their intentions were only to stabilize the cotton market. The cotton market is under increasing pressure from foreign cotton, making a turnaround difficult in the short term.</p>
<p>Hankow Standards Plummet Sharply by 8 or 9 Cents: Following the sharp decline in Indian cotton, the market was alarmed, with each standard falling by 2 to 6 cents. Selling pressure was strong in the afternoon, with heavy trading volume. This month is the last day, and prices fell another 6.5 cents. Shenchang covered short positions for 12,700 bales, the most. Others such as Dafu, Rongyu Maoji, Gongtai, Tianlong, Shenji, and Changfeng,</p>
<p>Yichang and Jin each sold 1,400 to 2,600 bales. Sellers included Changji, Hu Meiji, Zhenda, Minghua, Qinfeng, Yicheng, Tianchang, Xinhua, and Deji, ranging from 1,000 to 6,300 bales, with Lichang selling the most at 8,600 bales. The total transaction volume for the day was 116,200 bales. The closing prices for Hankow standards are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankow Standard Closing Prices: August 36.20, down 0.85, outstanding balance 838,000</p>

<p>Shensing Mill Purchases 5,000 Bales of Indian Cotton: There were no transactions for local cotton. However, Japanese merchants were discounting Indian cotton in the market, and Shensing Mill made large purchases. The source included 500 bales of Tonghua cotton and 400 bales of Yao cotton. The sales prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Xingheng Cotton 35.25: Shensing Mill purchased 3,000 bales, immediate delivery to the mill. Amra 34.50, purchased another 2,000 bales. Also Also Also</p>

<p>Indian cotton prices plummeted. Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially weakened due to selling pressure, but later rebounded slightly due to unfavorable weather and short covering. Futures rose or fell by 2 to 20 points. Spot prices rose by 20 points. English cotton futures fell by 5 to 6 points, and spot prices fell by 17 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points. Although there were exporter purchases of Indian cotton, the market was soft due to profit-taking and uncertain sentiment. Pingguoer fell by 24 rupees for prompt delivery and 32 rupees for forward delivery. Aomula fell by 25 rupees for prompt delivery and 23 rupees for forward delivery. Bairoxi fell by 27 rupees for prompt delivery and 20 rupees for forward delivery. The original telegram is recorded below (dated 25th):</p>

<p>New York, 25th: The Farnsworth Publishing House announced that this time's cotton field estimate is 45,518,000 acres, a decrease of 651,000 acres compared to the previous estimate (May 27th). The amount of cotton harvested is 14,959,000 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e164">The Difficulties of the Japanese Cotton Industry <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese cotton industry is facing difficulties for several reasons: first, the sharp decline in silver ingots has led to sluggish exports to China; second, the increase in Indian taxes has hindered exports; and third, the domestic implementation of austerity policies has reduced consumer spending. Furthermore, the decline in raw cotton prices has resulted in intangible losses from stockpiled inventory. Due to these factors, the Japanese cotton industry is experiencing a significant impact and is in a difficult situation. However, despite this environment and during the first period of reduced operations, the number of spindles in operation continues to increase, and cotton yarn production has consequently increased rather than decreased. The situation for this year is recorded below:</p>
<p>Number of Spindles Production Amount Number of Spindles Production Amount</p>
<p>January 6,390,000 231,000 March 5,960,000 219,000</p>
<p>February 6,230,000 234,000 April 5,962,000 227,000</p>
<p>From the table above, the number of spindles decreased by 260,000 and production decreased by 15,000 bales in February and March due to reduced operations. However, production increased again in April, which is quite strange. However, after considering the situation, the mills have their own difficulties. Small and medium-sized spinning mills, due to credit relationships with financial institutions, continue to produce despite knowing they are incurring losses. Large spinning mills, fearing social criticism due to worker unemployment, also reluctantly continue production despite knowing they are incurring losses. Engaging in production without being able to expand sales further exacerbates the difficulties. Participating in the spinning industry association and facing fierce criticism without being able to explain themselves, this decision led to a second round of 10% reduction in operations.</p>
<p>Grain: Flour Mills Reduce Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market fell across the board in the morning and afternoon trading for all months. This is because current market sentiment has shifted its focus due to sluggish sales. The new wheat crop will inevitably be cheaper at some point, regardless of its quality. This fundamental factor suggests a potential decline. Furthermore, the northern provinces, due to a good wheat harvest, currently have no demand for Shanghai flour. With sluggish sales, the market inevitably declined. Millers again released large quantities, and large-scale speculative buyers also sold aggressively. Considering this, it is possible that prices may return to 4 cents and a half. As a result, the current month was down another 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, July was down 2 fen, August was down 2.5 fen, September was down 2.5 fen, October was down 1.5 fen, and November was down 2 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Wheat Futures and Spot Prices Both Fell Slightly <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the current month's wheat futures were initially relatively stable due to delivery, but then speculative buyers sold off, briefly falling to 4 taels 8 qian and 1 fen. However, prices rebounded by the close. The far months remained firm due to the belief of mainland dealers that rice prices would remain high. Therefore, each board showed a slight improvement compared to the previous day. However, if flour sales do not improve, it will be difficult to sustain this level. As a result, the current month was down 1 fen, and August, October, and November were all up more than 2 fen, with no change for other months. Spot wheat arrivals were abundant, and millers were hesitant, mostly adopting a wait-and-see attitude due to sluggish flour sales. Therefore, each board opened 3 or 4 fen lower. Shashi wheat opened at 4 taels 8 qian and 7 fen, Yangzhou wheat at 4 taels 7 qian and 7 fen, Chongming wheat at 4 taels 7 qian and 2 fen, and old wheat at 5 taels 2 qian and 4 fen. Only 2,000 bags were transacted in the general market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign rice prices rose by 1 to 4 jiao due to mainland buyers and the strong interest of Wenzhou dealers. Although there were arrivals and road goods being sold off. The inventory of foreign coarse rice was low and small. Both mainland and local dealers welcomed the rice leading to a jump of half a yuan. The total market transactions were active. 1,000 bags of Mindang coarse road goods, 300 bags of small-size current coarse rice, 4,000 bags for delivery at the end of the month, 1,000 bags of Qiye coarse rice and another 300 bags at the end of the month. Small-size rice had the most transactions yesterday, totaling more than 10,000, priced at 17 yuan and 7 jiao. 6,000 bags of large-size rice, 3,000 bags of Kega rice, 1,000 bags of Mindang rice, 2,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice, and another 5,000 bags of No. 2 Saigon rice.</p>

<p>Conflict Between Cargo Owners and Rice Shops</p>
<p>Yesterday, no ships arrived at the River Below in Zhabei. The remaining inventory in the more than 40 stores was evaluated publicly. Cargo owners were required to open the holds according to the assessed price. Special high-quality North Japonica rice was priced at 21 yuan, with medium and low qualities priced lower in batches. However, the cargo owners insisted on the cost and refused to open the holds, leading to a forced opening of the holds and a conflict between the cargo owners and the stores. Therefore, only a few dozen stones were unloaded throughout the day. The remaining Bianyuan, Foreign Pointed, Thin Rice, and North Japonica rice had no transactions. The market situation was stagnant. No goods arrived at the River Below in the South Bund, and the market was even more depressed. Furthermore, the remaining goods in the warehouses had been unloaded, resulting in a quiet scene. Among the various goods, only a very small amount of Bianyuan rice was available for sale, with prices the same as the previous day. The rest were all foreign rice transactions.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: European and American Silk Telegrams Remain Unchanged in Shanghai</p>
<p>European and American consumption is decreasing, and telegrams remain unchanged. American and Japanese dealers hope for a small price increase and are stockpiling, while the factories are unwilling to sell at a loss because silk prices are not loose. Besides some maintenance efforts, transactions are few. Yesterday, Qianli and others brought 50 bales of new factory-direct silk, and Zhonghe and others brought 20 bales of Baigan silk, with prices remaining firm.</p>
<h3 id="e168">40% Loss of Summer Cocoon Production in Huzhou <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The summer silkworm rearing in the old Huzhou prefecture, including Wuxing, Changping, and Huzhou, was not weak this year. However, due to excessive cold and heavy rainfall, the silkworm ants were discovered to be weak and many ran off. The new cocoons are now on the market, and the cocoon production is less than 40% of the normal yield. The quality of the cocoons varies. The foreign breed cocoons in the Nanxun area are the best. 60% to 70% of the cocoon businesses have opened scales, but there is more demand than supply, and cocoon prices are high. High-quality goods in Wuxing County have opened at 66 to 70 yuan, and the rest at 60 to 65 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Qimen Black Tea Suddenly Becomes Weak and Quiet <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overall trend in the tea market in Shanghai remained soft. Qimen black tea suddenly turned weak and quiet. There were no transactions for Yingde tea from various estates. For Lucha green tea from various estates, only the Zhenmei tea from Beixiang, Wuyuan, still had some scattered sales. The rest were all stagnant. Dealers from England and France showed some interest in Zhuanmei and Xiu Mei teas, but the sales prices were extremely low. The market situation was very pessimistic.</p>
<p>North and South Goods: Guanyuan Dealers Decide to Increase Prices</p>
<p>Recently, there have been few arrivals of Guanyuan. The goods stored in the various businesses are mostly of medium and low quality. There is a severe shortage of high-quality goods. Due to the current rainy season, the existing inventory requires repeated roasting to avoid mold. However, this has inevitably increased costs, including labor and charcoal, as well as weight loss. If the goods are still sold at the original price, it will be difficult to cover costs. It was reported yesterday that the Guanyuan industry association invited various businesses to jointly decide to implement price increases to maintain capital. Currently, high-quality goods have increased by 2 liang compared to before, and low-quality goods have increased by 1 liang. Top quality is 38 liang, Tianji is 24 liang, Tianhong is 16 liang, and Chuban is 13 liang, Zheng is 22 liang.</p>
<p>Metals: Metal Orders Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>Since the metal market was affected by exchange rates, the number of bankruptcies in the industry has been increasing. Although prices have soared, there are few buyers. The market is even more sluggish than before. Although some colors are traded widely, the main roads are extremely cold. Therefore, overseas orders are very weak. It is said that only one or two orders have been made since Monday. There has not been much movement in American and Japanese goods either.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Dongbai Iron Arrivals and Sales are Both Strong <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Although there have been many recent arrivals of Dongbai iron, sales have also been exceptionally brisk. Therefore, supply and demand are balanced, and the market is lively. The standard is unusually high due to the frequent rise in the East Exchange. Currently, the market price for 3.7 chi is estimated at 1 tael 1 qian 7 fen per sheet, and 3.6 chi is estimated at 9 qian 6 fen and 5 li per sheet. The Fujian dealers are the most active in trading, and the inland Yangtze River dealers are also quite enthusiastic. The local Jian dealers also have some interest.</p>

<h3 id="e171">The Nationality and Internationality of Art <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>By Ye Qiuyuan, Collection of Art Essays</p>
<p>Published by the United Bookstore</p>
<p>At a time when the literary movement of nationalism is thundering across the Chinese literary scene, I think it would be meaningful to introduce this book, [The Nationality and Internationality of Art], to our readers.</p>
<p>This book is divided into three parts: Part 1, Art Theory; Part 2, Literary Theory; and Part 3, Art History Theory. To save time and space, this article will only introduce Part 1, Art Theory, which is closely related to nationalist literature. The remaining two parts will have to wait until another opportunity.</p>
<p>Art Theory is a collection of six short art essays. His argument can be said to be a rising force in the current Chinese art scene, which is extremely shaken in thought and trapped in abnormal development.</p>
<p>The author is also unable to bear the decline of the Chinese art scene, so he said: [In order to make our art world gradually move towards a healthy development path, I feel that it is really no longer possible to wait any longer to say a few words today, knowing that in this era of great upheaval (or unable to understand a slightly more serious theory] (page 39). Although we also feel that in this era of great upheaval, many people are like drunkards, with blurred eyes and unable to distinguish right from wrong, relying on a burst of drunken enthusiasm to shout and jump around. If you don't understand reason and try to talk to him politely, it will of course be a waste of time and he won't listen to a single word. If you're not careful, he will also treat you unkindly with malice. Smart people are not very willing to do such unpleasant things, but we can't allow a drunkard to do whatever he wants, which is also inevitable. If everyone stands by with their hands in their sleeves, everything will inevitably be destroyed in the drunkard's hands. This is also the case in the current art world. We feel that the more turbulent the era, the more we need serious theories, and the responsibility of artists will be increased. We must not allow art to be smoked out by a group of drunkards and destroyed.</p>
<p>Here we know that the author is loyal to art, so he finally cannot remain silent. At the same time, we can also see his views on art, the current state of the Chinese art world, and the common efforts that the art world should make in the future.</p>
<p>In the chapter on the main trends of modern art, he explained the nature, distribution, and development of modernism. In the meaning of art, he discussed the essence of art, the classification of art, and the origin of art one by one, and then proposed the spirit of new art. He said that the spirit of modern art is movement and originality. Finally, he quoted Mr. Zhu Yingpeng's words to conclude that the new art movement at least contains full secular thought and full free thought, at least to attack ideological thought, to attack religious thought, to attack mountain and forest hermit thought, to attack fate thought, to attack wind-chanting and moon-playing, red-dressed men and green-dressed women literature]. The author highly agrees with this view, so he also hopes to have considerable construction and considerable creation.</p>
<p>The author believes that art cannot be separated from politics. He uses historical facts to prove his theory that [art cannot be separated from politics and art evolves with politics] and that the development of national art must be filled with national concepts.</p>
<p>In the chapter on the nationality and internationality of art, the author further recognizes that modern politics is completely dominated by nationalism and internationalism. These two trends seem to be incompatible, but they have a very close cause-and-effect relationship. The more internationalized society becomes, the more obvious the color of nationalism becomes. If, under this trend of internationalization, one does not express one's own national characteristics, one will inevitably perish. Therefore, when art is internationalized, the nationality of art must be more prominent, so that the spirit of our nation can be fully expressed internationally to obtain the basis for our superior international position. In modern art and nationalism, the author explained the relationship between art and the nation more thoroughly. Now I will quote it below as the result of this article.</p>
<p>······Art will ultimately take the nation as its background, and the life of the nation is the subject matter expressed in artistic works. Art is national, and what Westerners call ＮＡtionalart, or national art or ethnic art, is based on folk life, folk thought, folk religion, and the Locialornationaltemqerment of the nation as its artistic purpose. This situation is obvious. Western artists engage in national art, taking the nation as the premise and making it their responsibility to promote the national style. This situation is not seen in China. Chinese people only have family style and family learning, but they lack national style and national life. Modern art is still a national or ethnic art, although this movement</p>
<p>seems to have affected various countries.</p>
<p>Correction: The author [Bing Hui] of the Avant-Garde Weekly Creative Issue introduced the other day was mistakenly identified as [Bing Heng]. We hereby correct this.</p>

<p>Chapter 44: Modern Spanish Literature</p>
<p>When we come to the most modern Spanish novels, this interest is undoubtedly the same as when talking about other modern literature. We cannot say much about modern Spaniards. In my opinion, existing readers must sift through the ashes themselves. This is not to say that anyone can take care of the stoves of the whole world, but that any intelligent reader can participate in the sifting.</p>
<p>Among the existing Spanish writers, the one who most faithfully adheres to his profession as a writer, his business, his art, is Pio Baroja. His "Market of the Meek" shows the conflicts between cities and many streets and alleys and people, as well as the appearance of indulgence and adventure. Moreover, Baroja has a sense of despairing opposition between different social classes. For example, in a novel (the English translation title "The Quest" is not at all the Spanish title, but the translation is excellent), he depicts the contrast between the unfortunate nightlife and daytime life of modern cities.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, young people oppose established social and political systems, and Spanish artists often mix their art with politics, which damages it. This is what the most excellent English critic of Spanish literature said. This may be true, but in other countries, the most outstanding and courageous artists have also opposed the government they dislike, or taken up swords or pens for the government they like. Think of Vigny, Hugo, the cavalier poets of 17th century England, Tolstoy, almost all Russians. The question is, what is the relationship between poetry and politics? Putting that aside, I think that one of the most interesting modern Spaniards, not very famous in English translation, is Unamuno, who is a essayist, satirist, magazine reporter, and poet. He has obtained the glory of being exiled from his home country. Exile is a form of punishment that modern governments rarely use when dealing with scholars. Why? Because exile immediately increases their reputation, ideas spread to the world, and those worthy of exile may be suspected of knowing how to retaliate with writing for this reason.</p>
<p>Another Spaniard who resisted the government is the famous writer Blasco Ibáñez. I am informed by astute critics that in Spain he is regarded as a buffoon. Indeed, he is an outstanding and high-class buffoon, creating his international reputation (or perhaps because several of his books have been translated into English and other national languages before, confirming that reputation). "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" contains very moving dramatic scenes, cleverly embellished, appealing to the hearts of people who are in the midst of war or suffering because of war. However, since we are promised jokes, we might as well quote what the late W.D. Howells said about Blasco Ibáñez: "Ibáñez achieves effects beyond the art of Henry James; yet, even so, in lightness and beauty he falls below James."</p>
<p>Howells, who loved Spain and read many Spanish books, may have seen lightness and beauty in two contemporary Spaniards, Valle-Inclán and J.W. Ruiz, who calls himself Azorín. Valle-Inclán is subtle...</p>

<p>—Goldsmith</p>
<p>Most of the writers mentioned in this short chapter are from before the 19th century, so we are trampling on the order of the ages. However, it seems most convenient to place this chapter, which is very strange and not overly important, here.</p>
<p>Why? Because Dutch literature is unimportant. Two erudite Dutchmen who generously taught me on this subject also take an almost disdainful attitude towards their own country's literature, especially later literature, and agree with this statement. Occasional visitors to European (and American) art galleries are surprised by the abundance of Dutch painting. Azorín, the author of "The Pleasant Recollections of the Duke of Braganza" and the beautiful trilogy based on the Carlist Wars, is an organic talent and valuable work. The author of "Confessions of a Little Philosopher" is destined to enter the world's library (if we can make fun of destiny). There is a lot of promise and achievement in modern Spanish literature. We can only hint at this before we must travel by plane to a country that political Spain did not treat with kindness in the past.</p>
<p>Literature.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Italians were the only competitors of the Dutch and Flemings during the Renaissance. The Italians were extremely great in all forms of literature, but the Dutch devoted all their efforts to arts other than literature. Or it may be that the Dutch language, like the neighboring German language, did not achieve a high degree of development until modern times and was always heavy and not flexible.</p>
<p>The two greatest Dutchmen, Spinoza and Erasmus, were humanists who did not use Dutch but wrote in Latin. Erasmus, a friend of Thomas More whom we met in an earlier chapter, like all humanists, had a tendency to turn back the clock and prevent the growth of modern languages. Why? Because in the eyes of humanists, all virtues lie in Greek and Latin. Erasmus was a scholar in the true sense of the word. He loved literature, especially classical literature, and especially ecclesiastical literature, because in ecclesiastical literature he saw what he, like most people at that time (remember that the year 1500 divided his seventy-year life into two equal parts), thought was the truth. The classicism of the Renaissance was mostly not Greek or Latin that ancient Romans could understand, but Christian. The best aspects of Erasmus are his letters and "Dialogues," a collection of dialogues on various subjects. It would not be clumsy criticism to put Plato's "Dialogues," Erasmus's "Dialogues," and Landor's "Imaginary Conversations" on the same bookshelf and look at them together, without saying a word about comparative value.</p>
<p>A century after Erasmus's death, Spinoza, who was neither Christian nor pagan but Jewish, was born in Amsterdam. Together with Bacon, Descartes, and Bruno, he was one of the founders of modern philosophy. It is questionable whether Spinoza belongs in our record, as I have indicated, because he was a rigorous, abstruse, and specialized philosopher who wrote in somewhat condensed scholarly Latin. His writing, according to Latin scholars, is that of a sound and precise thinker, but there is an artistic color there. (Erasmus had this, Bacon also had it, and in modern times Nietzsche, Bernard Shaw, William James, and Santayana also have it.) Scholars are there, but his method is lacking: a so-called philosophical geometry, setting out theorems with numbers, proofs, corollaries, and axioms. It was not until the beginning of the 19th century that philosophers and scholars such as Herder, Lessing, and Novalis rediscovered him. He was buried for a hundred years. Now he is one of the heroes of philosophical thought, and perhaps he does not completely lack literary color. The title of a part of his "Ethics," "On Human Bondage," was taken as the title of W. Somerset Maugham's most profound and beautiful modern novel.</p>
<p>In Dutch literature, as in all literature, we must go to legends, folk songs, and popular romances to seek the most fragrant materials. Holland at least contributed a world-famous translation of the "Reynard the Fox" poem by the minstrel Willem. This is one of the oldest translations of that famous story. It was translated into English from an undoubtedly Dutch prose version by Caxton. Such legends, romances, and satires move from one country to another. The question is only the skill of the adapter or importer, and now, in terms of novels, poetry, and criticism, that is still the only question. In medieval literature, the concept of ownership did not exist. The author did not need to apologize for adopting ideas seen anywhere. Reinaert (Reynard the Fox) seems to be the only great story that was popular in Dutch translation, and the most colorful modern version that was once very popular is Goethe's Reineckefuchs.</p>
<p>The greatest Dutch writer is the poet Vondel. He was born at the end of the 16th century and lived through three-quarters of the 17th century. He wrote tragedies that combined dramatic force and lyrical beauty. On the one hand, he is compared to Racine because he dramatized the heroic stories of the Bible. On the other hand, his masterpiece "Lucifer" links him with Milton. Milton seems to have at least the scholarly knowledge of that great Dutch drama, but it is doubtful what he took from it. "Paradise Lost," "Paradise Regained," and "Lucifer" have nothing in common except for the subject matter and the noble style. The two poets take completely different approaches. "Lucifer" is dramatic and lyrical, while Milton's poem is an epic narrative. A beautiful account of that poet and his political and religious background is in Professor A.J. Barnouw's biography of Vondel.</p>
<p>After Vondel's era, Dutch literature declined. Most of the works of the 18th century are very dull. A revival came at the end of that century and the beginning of the 19th century. The pioneer of the new era was the didactic poet Bilderdijk. His insightful poetry was very popular in Holland, but it did not make much of an impression in other countries. In England, he would be considered a second-rate poet. He was a serious scholar who earned the respect of such excellent critics as Robert Southey. However, from the fact that he thought Shakespeare lacked deliberation and disliked new German poetry, it can be inferred that his concept of aesthetic awareness was limited.</p>
